  "full_translation": "**The Genealogy of the Han Celestial Masters**\n\n*Title:* *The Genealogy of the Han Celestial Masters*\n*Author:* Zhang Zhengchang of the Ming Dynasty\n*Four fascicles*\n*Source edition:* *Wanli Continuation of the Daoist Canon*\n\n**Fascicle One of *The Genealogy of the Han Celestial Masters***\n\n**Preface to *The Genealogy of the Han Celestial Masters***\n\nThe Forty-Second Celestial Master of the Han Succession, Perfected Zhang, entrusted the Daoist of Supreme Clarity, Fu Tongxu, with the task of soliciting a preface from Jian Lian for this *Genealogy*.\n\nLian has heard that in ancient times, when eminent ministers of an age were recorded by official historians, their lineages were invariably prefaced with genealogical accounts, arranged in order for transmission, so as to honor their origins and illuminate their meritorious deeds. In the governance of divine lineages, there are matters that cannot be omitted.\n\nThe present *Genealogy* traces its origins to the Marquis of Liu and Perfected Wen, though nothing is recorded of what came before. Relying on the *Records of Clans and Lineages*, Lian has supplemented these omissions and, following historical conventions, briefly outlined the succession of transmission, so that one may grasp the general contours at a glance, while the details are presented separately below.\n\nThe preface states: The Zhang clan descends from the Ji lineage. Hu, the fifth son of Qingyang, a descendant of the Yellow Emperor, was the first to craft bows and arrows, establishing their use for hunting and sacrifice. As the overseer of the Bow Star, his descendants were entrusted with this office and granted the surname Zhang.\n\nDuring the reign of King Xuan of Zhou, there was a minister named Zhang Zhong. His descendants later served the state of Jin as grand officers. Zhang Hou begot Lao; Lao begot Junwu; Junwu begot Qu; Qu begot Ge; and Ge’s grandson was Yi.\n\nWhen the Three Jin divided the realm, the Zhang clan served the state of Han. Zhang Kaidi expanded Han’s territory and served as minister to Marquis Zhao and King Xuanhui. Xiang Kaidi begot Ping; Ping served as minister to King Xi and King Daohui. Ping’s son, Liang, styled Zifang, became the Han Grand Tutor and Marquis of Liu and Perfected Wen. Residing in Fengyi of Pei, he fathered two sons: the Palace Attendant Pijiang and Buyi.\n\nBuyi succeeded the marquisate and fathered two sons: Diangao and Dian. Dian begot Mo; Mo begot the Grand Marshal Jin; Jin begot the Duke of Yangling, Qianqiu, styled Wannian. Wannian begot Song; Song had five sons—Zhuang, Zan, Peng, Mu, and Shu—whose descendants flourished through their meritorious deeds.\n\nBy the Tang dynasty, the Zhang clan had become one of the forty-three eminent lineages of Anding, Fanyang, Taiyuan, Nanyang, Dunhuang, Xiuwu, Shanggu, Peiguo, Liangguo, Rongyang, Pingyuan, Jingzhao, and others, producing seventeen chancellors in all.\n\nSong begot Tong; Tong begot Wuwang; Wuwang begot Liren; Liren begot Hao; Hao begot Gang; Gang begot the Perfected of Tongwu, Dashun. Dashun begot Dao-ling, the Han Celestial Master, who became the founder of the Mystery Teachings. His lineage endured far longer and flourished even more than the earlier eminent clans. Those who discuss these matters, failing to examine the facts, assume that after the Marquis of Liu’s reincarnation and the abolition of his state, his line was extinguished. Little do they know of the proliferation of his descendants across the north and south.\n\nDao-yuan, styled Fu, was born in the tenth year of Jianwu (34 CE) on Tianmu Mountain in Wu. In his youth, he studied widely and had over a thousand disciples. Later, he was summoned to court for his forthright counsel and remonstrated vehemently against the imperial examinations. Appointed magistrate of Jiangzhou in Ba Commandery, he resigned from office and retired to Yushan north of Luoyang, where he cultivated the refinement of his bodily form.\n\nEmperor Zhang summoned him as Academician, but he did not go. When Emperor He ascended the throne, he was called to serve as Grand Mentor and enfeoffed as Marquis of Ji, yet he likewise declined. Instead, he took up his staff and wandered to the Huai region, entering Poyang, ascending Dragon-Tiger Mountain, and compounding the Divine Elixir of the Nine Heavens. Seeking the Western Immortal Source, he obtained the *Ordinances for Commanding the Five Peaks*, and from the Bi-Lu Grotto, he retrieved the secret texts for summoning the Ten Thousand Spirits and the Divine Tiger. Shortly after, he entered a stone chamber on Mount Song and obtained the *Yellow Emperor’s Nine Cauldrons Scripture*. When his Dao was perfected, hearing that the miasmic qi of Ba and Shu harmed the people, he resolved to enter Shu. At first, he dwelled on Yangping Mountain, then moved to Mount Heming, where the Primordial Venerable Lord repeatedly bestowed upon him the methods of scriptural transmission. Thereupon, he divided his form to manifest transformations and established the Twenty-Four *Zhi*, adding four more to correspond to the Twenty-Eight Constellations. Malevolent plagues thereby waned and vanished; his deeds—such as unsealing the Springs of Salt and breaching the Ghost City—were too numerous to record in full.\n\nIn the second year of *Yongshou* (156 CE), he moved again to Queting Mountain, where he produced the pair of *Three-Five Demon-Slaying* swords, male and female, along with the *Yangping Zhi Capital Merit Seal*, and conferred them upon his successor, Celestial Master Heng, charging him to transmit them through the generations. Then, riding the clouds, he ascended, having lived one hundred twenty-three years.\n\nHeng, styled Lingzhen, was a man of great talent. Emperor Shao summoned him as Gentleman of the Yellow Gate, but he declined and retired to Yangping Mountain, vowing to guide the people with loyalty and filial piety. The noble-minded praised him for continuing the ancestral lineage, expanding its legacy, and bringing peace and goodness to the common folk.\n\nHeng begot Master Xi Lu, styled Gongqi, who delved even deeper into the achievements of his predecessors. Teaching others through the Daoist arts, he styled himself *Master*. Those who came to study the Dao were first instructed in its practices; once they demonstrated faith, they were called *Libationers* and taught to be sincere and free from deceit. If any fell ill, they were to confess their transgressions.\n\nLater, he established communal granaries, filling them with rice for public welfare. People were permitted to take according to their needs, but those who took excessively would invite misfortune. As followers grew daily, he settled in Hanzhong, where an imperial edict appointed him Commandant of Pacification and Governor of Hanning. Subsequently, he pledged allegiance to Cao Cao, the Grand Ancestor of Wei, who bestowed upon him the title General Who Pacifies the South and enfeoffed him as Marquis of Wenzhong. His five sons were all enfeoffed as marquises, and his daughter married Pengzu, a son of the Grand Ancestor.\n\nUpon Xi Lu’s passing, he was posthumously honored as Original Marquis.\n\nXi Lu begot Sheng, styled Yuanzong, whom the Grand Ancestor of Wei enfeoffed as Marquis of Duting, though Sheng declined. Returning from Hanzhong to Mount Longhu, he encountered the Three Primordial Days and ascended the altar to transmit the register to his son, Zhaocheng, styled Daorong. Zhaocheng sat upright in a stone chamber, where tigers and leopards would prostrate themselves upon encountering him. When he departed this world, some witnessed him riding a crane through the sky. Upon opening his tomb, only his cap and shoes remained.\n\nZhaocheng begot Shu Jin, whom Emperor An of Jin summoned, but Shu declined. Shu begot Hui, Hui begot Jiong, Jiong begot Fu, and Fu begot Xiang, styled Linbo, who served as a constable in Luoyang during the Sui. He could exhale cinnabar from his palm, its radiance piercing the chamber, and then swallow it again.\n\nXiang begot Tongxuan. During a great plague, he planted a staff in water, and all who drew and drank from it recovered. Tongxuan begot Heng, whom Emperor Gaozong of Tang questioned on governing the state. Heng replied, \"If one can practice non-action, the realm will be well-governed.\" The emperor praised him.\n\nHeng begot Guang, Guang begot Cizheng, and Cizheng begot Shilong. Shilong once forgot a jade seal in a Chang’an tavern. A youth exerted all his strength to lift it but could not budge it. The next day, Shilong barked and snatched it away.\n\nShilong begot Ying Shao, Ying Shao begot Yi, and Yi begot Shiyuan, styled Zhongliang. Gaunt yet heavily bearded, he dwelled on Mount Ying Tian for forty years. The mountain teemed with tigers, deterring visitors. Whenever great winds and rains arose, he was seen riding a black dragon among the peaks.\n\nShiyuan begot Xiu, Xiu begot Chen, and Chen begot Bing, also styled Wenfu. His gaze flashed like lightning, and he could see clearly at night. Once, while carrying a sword through mountains and marshes, he rebuked an ancient tree, and thunder immediately struck, killing two giant pythons and over a hundred smaller serpents.\n\nBing begot Shan, and Shan begot Jiwen. In the late Five Dynasties period, many received his registers, so he cast tens of thousands of iron ring contracts to bind them. Jiwen begot Zhengsui.\n\nIn the eighth year of the *Great Central Auspiciousness* reign of the Song, Zhengsui was summoned to court and granted the title *Master of True Stillness*. Thereafter, all who were called *Master* received such titles. Minister of Personnel Wang Qinruo memorialized the throne to establish the Register Transmission Bureau. Zhengsui begot the *Perfected of Clarity and Simplicity*, Master Qianyao, who begot the *Perfected of Emptiness and Whiteness*, Master Sizong. Sizong begot Xiangzhong, styled Gongchen. At three months, he could walk; at five months, he could speak. At seven, he was summoned to the capital and granted a purple robe.\n\nXiangzhong begot the *Perfected of Preserved Radiance*, Master Dunfu. Dunfu had no sons, so his nephew, the *Perfected of Preserved Authenticity*, Master Jingduan, succeeded him. Jingduan also had no sons, so his younger cousin, the *Perfected of Emptiness and Serenity*, Master Jixian, succeeded.\n\nJixian, styled Jiawen, was mute until the age of five. Upon hearing a rooster crow, he suddenly sighed and composed a poem, astonishing all. In the early *Chongning* reign, the waters of the Xiefang Pond overflowed. An envoy summoned him, and he inscribed an iron talisman, casting it into the water. Thunder roared, shattering the flood dragon, which died at the water’s edge.\n\nOne day, he followed the emperor into the sleeping chambers, where palace ladies competed to have him inscribe their fans. He wrote passages from the scriptures, each secretly aligning with their thoughts. Among them, one lady prostrated herself and presented a fan, on which he wrote: *\"Protect and secure the nation’s destiny, enduring as long as Heaven.\"* It was the emperor’s own fan, who marveled at this.\n\nWhen he prayed for rain, it ceased after three days. He was appointed Grand Master of the Supreme Void but declined. An edict ordered the Jiangdong transport commissioner to survey land on the mountain, relocating and constructing the *Upper Clarity Abbey*, which was renamed the *Orthodox Unity Abbey*. His disciples, numbering in the tens or hundreds, followed him.\n\nIn the early *Jingkang* reign, the emperor summoned him again.\n\nAt that time, the Jurchen invaded Bianjing, and as he traveled to the Tianqing Abbey in Sizhou, he asked for paper and brush to write a poem, then leaned against his desk and passed away, buried at the foot of Guishan. Sixteen years later, Sa Shoujian of Xihe, traveling through Qingcheng Mountain, encountered him at the gorge’s mouth. Jixian gave him a letter and a red crow, instructing him to deliver them to the succeeding Celestial Master. The Celestial Master’s household was greatly astonished, and when they had Guishan’s tomb opened, only the crow remained. Jixian had no descendants, so he designated Shixiu, the grandson of his disciple Xiangzhong, as his heir. Shixiu said, *\"I am your junior—how could I succeed you?\"* The assembly replied, *\"The succession of the Dao lies where the lineage draws it—who can refuse?\"* Thus, he complied.\n\nShixiu fathered Master Zhengying Shouzhen, who remained in his mother’s womb for nineteen months before birth. In Piling, a malevolent spirit possessed a tree, and he was summoned to exorcise it. One night, wind and thunder uprooted it. Later, he stabilized the surging Yangtze’s floods, and Emperor Gaozong bestowed upon him an ivory tablet, a precious sword, and the scriptures *Qingjing* and *Yinfu*. Shouzhen fathered Jingyuan, who fathered Qingxian. In Zhanggong Cave was a well of great depth; Qingxian playfully tore a leaf and tossed it in. Suddenly, waves surged, and an old man emerged from within. Qingxian rebuked him, and he departed. Qingxian had no sons, so his nephew, Master Guanmiao Keda, succeeded him. Keda was Shouzhen’s great-grandson; his grandfather, Bolin, and father, Tianlin, had both administered the teachings.\n\nWhen the waters of Poyang swelled, destroying countless homes, Magistrate Yuan Gufu requested Keda to intervene. He slew a large white serpent, and the waters subsided. During a drought, Keda prayed, and rain fell, ending the parched spell. He was appointed Commissioner of the Three Mountains’ Talismans, concurrently overseeing the imperial abbeys and the affairs of the Daoist teachings, and was made abbot of Longxiang Abbey.\n\nIn the late Song era, Kublai Khan of the Yuan heard of his divine efficacy and secretly sent envoys to inquire. Keda presented him with the *Lingquan* and told the envoys, *\"Serve your lord well. In twenty years, he shall unify the realm.\"* By the thirteenth year of the *Zhiyuan* reign, this proved true.\n\nKeda fathered Zongyan, styled Shichuan, who showed exceptional intelligence from youth. After Kublai conquered the Song, recalling his father’s prophetic words, he dispatched Minister of War Wang Shiying and Minister of Justice Xiao Yubao to summon him. He was bestowed a jade crown and jade tablet, granted the title *Zhendao Lingying Chonghe Zhenren*, and given a third-rank silver seal, charged with overseeing Daoist affairs in the Jiangnan region and authorized to ordain disciples as Daoists at his discretion.\n\nZongyan fathered Yudi, styled Guohua. During Kublai’s reign, he was conferred the title *Tixuan Hongdao Guangjiao Zhenren*, receiving generous rewards, but he ultimately died in the capital. Yudi had no sons, so his younger brother, Yucai, succeeded him.\n\nYucai, styled Guoliang, was received in audience at the Daming Hall in the early *Yuanzhen* reign and was granted the title *Taisu Ningshen Guangdao Dazhenren*. In the second year of the *Dade* reign, the tidal waters of Haiguan and Guano prefectures surged, eroding nearly a hundred *li* of sandy shores and threatening the prefectural city. Yucai cast an iron talisman into the water; it leapt out three times. Amidst thunder and darkness, a monstrous fish-headed, turtle-bodied creature over a *zhang* in length was slain, and the embankments returned to their former state.\n\nIn the fifth winter of the *Dade* reign, no snow fell. The emperor said, *\"Without winter snow, will the people not suffer calamity?\"* Yucai built an altar and prayed. That night, snow fell a foot deep. The emperor rejoiced and ordered his ministers to present him with wine, saying, *\"You have moved the spirits to such an extent!\"*\n\nIn the eighth year, his merits in pacifying the tides were recorded, and he was further appointed as the Master of Orthodox Unity, concurrently overseeing the talismans and registers of the Three Mountains. A silver seal was bestowed upon him, with rank equivalent to the second grade. In the ninth year, the sea embankments of Chongming Prefecture collapsed, and he dispatched his disciple to suppress the disaster with a talisman. The people dreamed of a deity filling the sea, and the land was thereafter secure.\n\nAt the beginning of the *Zhida* reign, he was further granted a precious crown and golden robes, and was conferred the title of Grand Master for Splendid Happiness with Gold and Purple, enfeoffed as Duke of Liu, and given a silver seal with rank equivalent to the first grade. Yucai’s son, Taixuanzi Sicheng, succeeded him; his Daoist practices were illustrious, and the imperial court’s rewards and honors were no less than his father’s. After Sicheng’s passing, his younger brother Side succeeded him. After Side’s passing, his son Zhengyan succeeded. After Zhengyan’s passing, Taixuan’s son Zhengchang succeeded. Styled Zhongji, he is the present Celestial Master.\n\nDuring the imperial court of the present dynasty, he paid six visits to the capital. In the early *Hongwu* reign, he was conferred the title of Grand Master of Orthodox Unity, Successor of the Daoist Teachings, Protector of the State, Expounder of the Ancestral Way, Communicator of Sincerity, Venerator of the Dao, and Propagator of Virtue, overseeing Daoist affairs. A silver seal was bestowed upon him with rank equivalent to the second grade, along with silver ingots and a golden-latticed ritual robe. His father, Daxuan, was posthumously honored as Grand Master of Vast Transformation, Illuminator of Sincerity, and Venerator of the Dao, while his mother, Lady Hu, was enfeoffed as the Reverent, Benevolent, Kind, and Serene Mystic Lady. The court further honored him with a eulogy, praising his eyes that flashed like lightning and his dignified, awe-inspiring demeanor, which brought glory to his time. This was because the hereditary transmission of the lineage required those with large, round eyes to be the \"Mystic Respondents.\" The emperor thus alluded to this trait in his eulogy.\n\nIt is said that when the Marquis of Wencheng was young, he studied rites in Huaiyang and presented himself to the Lord of the Azure Sea. The Lord of the Azure Sea was a former Confucian scholar believed to be a sea deity. Later, he encountered the extraordinary figure, the Yellow Stone Elder, beneath the bridge at Nai. Even in his early years, he had already established communication with the spirits. In his later years, having achieved fame and success, he sought to practice grain avoidance and wander with Master Red Pine, fulfilling his original aspiration—not as a pretext for self-preservation.\n\nThus, when the lineage was transmitted to the Celestial Master of the Han, his descendants were inspired to cultivate the arts of lightness and longevity, dispelling yin malevolence and transforming the people solely through the virtuous Dao. The succeeding masters continued this practice, ensuring the tradition did not decline, ever fearful that someone might suffer an untimely end. During the late Han, when the realm was in turmoil, only the region of Bashu remained tranquil. Travelers carried no provisions, and residents barred no gates; the local administration relied on this stability to govern. Such conditions endured for nearly thirty years, and his contributions to the world were truly vast. It is fitting that his descendants continue to emerge, aiding in the perfection of governance—how could this not surpass the merits of the feudal lords? Heaven’s recompense is indeed manifest.\n\nSome attribute this solely to the numinous qi of the sacred mountains, claiming it enabled such flourishing greatness. Yet this view is shallow. Alas, the descendants of the Marquis of Wencheng are found throughout the north and south. Those who distinguished themselves through meritorious deeds, whether in minor roles as illustrious masters or in major ones as chief ministers, were indeed brilliant and outstanding. Yet before long, some descended to the status of menial servants—an inescapable fate. How does this compare to the unbroken lineage of the Mystic Descendants, enduring for over twelve hundred years? There must indeed be a Dao behind this.\n\nMay those who rise hereafter take heed! May they take heed!\n\nComposed on the fifteenth day of the first month in the ninth year of *Hongwu* by Song Lian, Grand Master of the Palace with Honors, Hanlin Academician, Reader-in-Waiting, Participant in the Drafting of the State History, and Grand Master for Assisting the Crown Prince.\n\n[One character in this text is unclear in the original manuscript.]\nPostscript.\n\nWhen King Wu conquered Shang, he enfeoffed eight hundred states. Examining the histories, those whose later generations can still be verified are few enough to count on one’s fingers. Yet those whose lineages remained illustrious and unbroken were only Song, Lu, Qi, Jin, Wu, Chu, Yan, Zhao, Chen, Qi, Guan, and Cai. Of these, only Yan and Qi maintained their ancestral sacrifices alongside Zhou’s own transmission. At the founding of Han, heroes rose in unison, following the High Emperor in his campaigns across the Central Plains. Once the realm was pacified, the High Emperor divided the land to enfeoff them—greater ones as kings, lesser ones as marquises—amounting to over a hundred. Yet by the first year of the later reign of Emperor Xiaowu, barely fifty or sixty years later, scarcely one or two in ten endured to the end. Emperor Xiaoxuan sought out their descendants, many of whom emerged from among hired laborers. By the time of Emperor Xiaocheng, their lines dwindled like planks on a perilous bridge—what had become of their grandeur? “Though the Yellow River narrow to a sash, though Mount Tai wear to a whetstone, the state shall endure forever”—yet only in their descendants. Viewed thus, none has sustained a lineage as enduring as Confucius, and next to him, none but the Han Celestial Master. The year after Confucius’s death, his former residence was made a temple for his worship. By the *Wude* era of Tang, the National University had its own temple; by *Kaiyuan*, every prefecture and county had one, and the realm universally offered sacrifices. A single descendant, the eldest of the lineage, inherited the title and presided over the rites. In Han times, he was the Marquis of Baocheng; in Song, the Duke Yansheng—this practice continues to this day. His cadet branches in Qufu and those scattered across the four directions have distinguished themselves through examination degrees, rising to office, achieving prominence and merit, and standing out in their generations—such men have never been lacking.\n\nThe Han Celestial Master’s lineage traces back to Marquis Liu of Wen Cheng, who was himself a descendant of Hui, the fifth son of the Yellow Emperor. From Hui through some generations to Marquis Wen Cheng, and from Marquis Wen Cheng through nine transmissions to the Han Celestial Master. From the Han Celestial Master to the present spans over twelve hundred years, with forty-three generations transmitted. Fitting sons and worthy grandsons have followed in unbroken succession, each carrying forward the brilliance of the last, illuminating and enriching what came before. No ruling house has failed to honor and exalt them. The divine lineage stretches on without end.\n\nThe Zhang and Kong clans—are they not somewhat alike? Why then have so many others vanished without trace, while these lineages grow ever more flourishing with time? There must be reasons worth understanding. When Zhou declined and no true kings arose, the feudal lords grew tyrannical, and men like Jie and Zhou stirred their cruelty to poison the realm. The people suffered calamities worse than floods or blades. Thanks to Confucius’s emergence, he refined the arts of the *ru* to propagate the kingly Way, rescuing a disordered age and restoring it to rectitude, so that all might be saved and live. Moreover, he committed the great principles and laws of governing the world to writing, providing a model for a hundred generations. Through him, the Dao of Heaven was made luminous, the patterns of Earth were made clear, and humanity found its ultimate foundation. Once the Three Powers were established, the myriad transformations were accomplished. The blessings of *Odes* and *Documents*, of benevolence and righteousness, endure as long as Heaven and Earth—thus his sacrificial legacy is truly vast, the “great virtue honored for a hundred generations.” How could the Han Celestial Master alone be different?\n\nThough the Han Celestial Master and Confucius followed different Ways, both were devoted to refining form and spirit, harmonizing with yin and yang, measuring the primal transformations, and communing with the divine. They warded off great disasters, averted great calamities, ensuring that malevolent forces did not arise, that plagues did not spread, that suffering was made safe, and that those cut off in youth lived to old age. For this world and its people, they may be said to have wrought great creation. Heaven’s nurturing of their descendants, allowing them to partake of their virtue, is but the principle of reciprocity. It is also as if to say: the house of Zhang, in its fine succession and transmission, has always had its rightful heirs. Even if natural disasters recur in every age, what cause for concern is there? These people will forever have a refuge to turn to.\n\nLet those who rise hereafter reflect on the accumulations of their ancestors, as the heavens above expect of them. If they resolutely take it upon themselves to match and exalt this legacy, then what is recorded here will be but a fraction of what is to come. The *Genealogical Record* of one scroll, detailing the forty-second-generation Celestial Master’s investiture as the Orthodox Unity Successor, Protector of the State, Expounder of the Ancestral Teachings, and Grand Perfected of Communicating Sincerity, Venerating the Dao, and Magnifying Virtue, was commissioned to his disciples for its creation. Thus, the Hanlin Academician-in-Attendance, Master Song Lian, composed its preface.\n\nThe present Celestial Master, Master Wuwei, observed that while its deeds were far-reaching, its language was refined. He had it revised and polished, intending to carve and transmit it to the world. He did not disdain me, Su Boheng, but asked me to compose a postscript. Seeing Master Wuwei’s devotion to this work, one may surmise his dedication to carrying forward the former glories and perpetuating his family’s legacy with all his remaining strength. This is why he has earned the favor of the One Man, fulfilled the hopes of the Four Assemblies, and enhanced the weight of the Mystic Teachings to that of the Nine Tripods. Though I dare not presume to follow in Master Song’s footsteps, my long-standing friendship with Master Wuwei is no recent thing. Thus, setting aside my presumption, I offer this as a preface.\n\nComposed on the *bing-shen* day of the fifth month in the *geng-wu* year of *Hongwu* by former Historiographer Su Boheng of Meishan. Postscript Three.\n\nIn days past, when I dwelt upon the cliffs of Mystery, I dreamed of Laozi discoursing on the Dao. Privately, I was moved by the wanderings of Master Red Pine, yet knew not who would succeed his teachings. How could it compare to my recent journey to Jinling, where my sail skimmed beneath Mount Lu’s peaks? Suddenly, Perfected Zhang’s boat drew near, and we moored at dusk. Clasping hands as if long acquainted, he produced a scroll—*The Genealogy of the Han Celestial Masters*—and said, “I beg you, sir, to compose a few words to illuminate my ancestors’ legacy.”\n\nI accepted and read it, sighing, “The brush of Grand Historian Song is already immortal—what more could I add?” Yet if I must speak, I recall that the Dao of Heaven and Earth is steadfast in its singularity. Though it may darken, crumble, or fade, its inherent principle remains unshaken; its clarity and tranquility are never destroyed. The Supreme One grasped this to uphold the Way, and the Orthodox Unity Perfected—True Man of the Dao—used it to further expand the Supreme One’s lineage. Thus, numinous qi was entrusted to later generations, its wondrous efficacy enduring over a thousand years, its transformative power as constant as a single day. Who can fathom its workings? Some say talismans command spirits, avert disasters, and quell malevolent vapors, rendering service to the state—heaven’s decree to flourish their line. If so, this is but a fraction of their truth.\n\nMaster Zhang’s radiant devotion to his ancestors’ legacy suggests his resonance with the True Unity. One day, when a prince passes Dragon Mountain playing the flute, let my dream of Laozi’s discourse serve as proof: does Master Zhang not grasp its meaning? He replied, “How dare I not preserve your words and deeds for generations? I shall gaze upon the purple qi crowning Dragon Mountain’s peak.”\n\nComposed by Wang Dexin, Recipient of the Presented Scholar Degree, Former Minister of the Three Departments, Twice Summoned by Imperial Edict to Rebuild Qingyuan, Master of Luodong at Green Ridge.\n**Preface Four**\n\nNowadays, when discussing eminent lineages, none surpass the House of Kong. Yet if we rank them, the Han Celestial Masters may well rival the Kongs. The Han Celestial Master, Zhang Daoling, descended from Marquis Wen Cheng. The marquis received the *Book of the Yellow Stone*, practiced grain avoidance, and emulated Master Red Pine, deepening the wellsprings of the Dao—his origins were thus profound. Across five generations, Ancestral Master Daoling arose, embodying the Supreme One’s intent. His learning unlocked the mysteries of creation, his cultivation perfected the Dragon-Tiger path. He took the Dao and virtue as his foundation, spirit as his mother, stillness as his teacher, and harmony as his companion. Commanding wind and clouds, he strode the Three Terraces to govern the cosmos; inhaling thunder and lightning, he wielded the stellar sword to sweep away dust and miasma. Rising in the Han, his influence did not end with the Han but spanned Tang, Song, and our Ming. Imperial decrees and honors blazed across eras, his title “Orthodox Unity” equaling dukes and marquises. Even the humblest of his lineage shared in this glory—was it not the splendor of a single ancestral line?\n\nNow, fifty generations later, his descendants perpetuate the Dao’s transformative flow, their legacy most enduring. Is this not what we call an eminent lineage? Could it be second to the House of Kong? Some dismiss talismans and spirit-summoning as mere illusion. Alas, how shallow their view! Observe the Celestial Masters: they consume the six qi to refine cinnabar and transmute white stone, they embrace the Three Ultimates to harmonize with the Mysterious Origin. They existed before heaven and earth’s beginning, their origins unfathomable; they will endure beyond heaven and earth’s end, their conclusion unknown. How could their lineage alone be deemed grand?\n\nHaving roamed these wondrous realms and obtained the *Genealogy of the Celestial Masters*, how could I not compose an encomium to extol its glory? Thus, I offer this preface.\n\nComposed in the second month of spring, the *ding-you* year of *Wanli*, by Yu Wenwei of Yuzhang, Recipient of the Presented Scholar Degree, Lecturer of the Classics Bureau, and Surveillance Commissioner of Yunnan Circuit.\n**Preface Five**\n\nThe Han Celestial Masters transmitted their legacy across dynasties—through Tang, Song, and into the Ming—continuously presiding over the Daoist teachings and encompassing the realm. Yet Buddhists slandered them, and Confucians reviled them, often and without cease. Our August Emperor, divinely martial, would not deviate from the *Spring and Autumn*’s principle of grand unity. He ennobled the twenty Celestial Masters, recording and honoring their successors. From the Han to the present, their flourishing has paralleled the House of Kong—this cannot be dismissed as mere human artifice.\n\nNo lineage persists for a thousand years without constancy. To reduce their legacy to talismans and spirit-summoning is to overlook their essence. Spirits obey when commanded, yet vanish when ignored—this is their nature. To grasp them is to see spirits; to release them is to perceive the Dao. Thus, to claim talismans cannot command spirits is folly. Yet not all can wield talismans. Their use flourished with Kou Qianzhi and Du Guangting but did not endure. The Celestial Masters, however, have thrived for fifty generations, their boundless prosperity rooted in the Dao’s vastness—something beyond mortal comprehension. Otherwise, even the heroic deeds of Han Gaozu and Tang Taizong would leave no trace of their descendants today.\n\nThus, the *Mystic Radiance*’s *Admonition Against Doubt*, Li Ying’s *Records of Shu*, and their slanderous claims cannot tarnish the truth. The *Scripture of Conversion for Barbarians* does not elevate Laozi—all such assertions are false. I simply affirm the Celestial Masters’ lineage, which rivals that of Confucius’ sage descendants. Was this mere coincidence?\n\nThe *Genealogy of the Celestial Masters* was first compiled during the *Hongwu* era, when the forty-second Celestial Master sought a preface from Grand Historian Song Jin. His account was thorough. Over two hundred years later, the fiftieth Celestial Master recognized me in the capital. Our meeting was brief, yet profound. Later, when he entered the palace to pay homage at the Vermilion Gate, he visited me again. Cultured, refined, and steeped in the Dao, he suddenly dispatched a letter from afar, requesting a preface for his scroll. From *Hongwu* to *Jiajing*, eight generations’ affairs are recorded here.\n\nAged and devoted to the Dao, I dare not favor one teaching over another. How could I not acknowledge that the Three Teachings ultimately converge?\n\nIn the autumn of the *guisi* year of the *Wanli* era, Zhou Tianqiu of Wu Commandery recorded.\n\n*Genealogy of the Han Celestial Masters, Scroll One* concludes.\n*Genealogy of the Han Celestial Masters, Scroll Two*\n\nCollated by Zhang Tie of Anren, Promoted *Jinshi*, Grand Master for Thorough Counsel, and Left Vice Minister of Works.\n\n**Preface to the Hereditary Transmission of the Celestial Masters**\n\nThe title \"Celestial Master\" appears in the *Plain Questions* and the *Zhuangzi*, being the supreme appellation for those who embody the Dao. Laozi transmitted the *Dao and Its Virtue* to the Ancestral Celestial Master of the Zhou. The Celestial Master initiated the Orthodox Unity teachings in the Han, and the Zhang lineage has now endured for forty-eight generations. The transmission of generations is recorded in such meticulous detail—how extraordinary! For fifteen hundred years, prosperity and decline have followed one another, rise and fall have succeeded in turn, yet no lineage has endured as singularly and enduringly as the Zhang family. Could this not be because they have gathered the essence of mountains and rivers, harmonized the convergence of Heaven and humanity, and thus achieved such longevity? Their legacy shall extend to posterity without end.\n\nThe Ancestral Celestial Master, named Daoling, styled Fuhan, was a native of Pei’s Fengyi. His ninth-generation ancestor, Zhang Liang, studied in Xiapei, where the Yellow Stone Elder on the ruined bridge bestowed upon him a book. Later, he aided the Han founder in conquering the realm and was enfeoffed as the Marquis of Liu for his merits. He said to the emperor, \"I wish to abandon the world of men and wander with Master Red Pine.\" His son, Buyi, succeeded him as the Marquis of Gaoyang, posthumously honored as the Cultured and Accomplished Marquis. Buyi’s son was Tong; Tong’s son was Wuwang; Wuwang’s son was Liren; Liren’s son was Hao, who became the Perfected One of Tongxiang. Hao’s son was Gang, the father of the Celestial Master. Wuwang’s son, Gang, had a son named Dashun. His mother dreamed of a divine being descending from the *Kui* star of the Northern Dipper, towering over ten feet, clad in embroidered robes, who presented her with a fragrant herb, saying, \"This is *qiangwei*.\" Upon waking, her clothing, chambers, and surroundings were imbued with an extraordinary fragrance that lingered for months. Moved by this, she conceived. On the fifteenth night of the first month in the tenth year of *Jianwu* of the Han, he was born in Tianmu Mountain of Wu. At his birth, the room was bathed in yellow and purple hues, the courtyard filled with violet qi, and the chamber radiant as daylight. The former fragrance was once more perceptible. He stood nine feet and two inches tall, with a broad forehead, crimson crown, green eyes, a high nose, square jaw, three-cornered gaze, a fine beard, arms hanging past his knees, and a bearing like a dragon crouching or tiger pacing—his presence was awe-inspiring. At seven, he read the *Book of Laozi* and grasped its meaning. He mastered the secrets of celestial patterns, geography, charts, prophecies, and apocrypha, as well as the classics and canons, with nothing escaping his comprehension. Over a thousand disciples studied under him.\n\nIn the thirty *li* south of Tianmu Mountain and eighty *li* northwest, halls for lecture and recitation stood—Lin’an’s Divine Mountain Abbey and Yuhang’s Tongxian Abbey were among these sites. Later, he journeyed from Zhe through Yu, crossed the Huai and Yellow Rivers, and entered the Shu Mountains, where he obtained texts on refining form and harmonizing *qi*, thereafter practicing grain avoidance and sleeping little.\n\nIn the second year of *Yongping*, at twenty-five, he ranked first in the imperial examination for forthright remonstrance and was appointed magistrate of Jiangzhou. Resigning his post, he returned to Yushan north of Luoyang, where he cultivated and refined himself for three years. A white tiger then arrived at his seat, bearing a talisman in its jaws.\n\nIn the fifth year of *Jianchu*, Emperor Zhang summoned him, but he did not rise. In the first year of *Yongyuan*, Emperor He summoned him to serve as Grand Tutor to the Marquis of Jixian, but three imperial edicts went unanswered. He traveled to the Huai region and dwelled on Taiping Mountain in Tongxiang. Alone with his disciple Wang Chang, he entered Poyang from the Huai, ascending Yuping’s Yuzi Peak. The mountain spirit prostrated itself upon the path, offering to receive his commands and be enshrined upon the summit, where he might refine the elixir. The mountain spirit, perceiving his intent, sent a pair of cranes to guide his comings and goings. He then abandoned the site, and when the elixir was complete, dragons and tigers appeared—hence the mountain’s name.\n\nAt over sixty years of age, he was still robust. Following a black tiger, he traced the river’s flow into Yunjin Mountain, where he consumed herbs to further strengthen himself. A divine personage, calling himself Zhao, appeared before him, saying: “I wish to eternally guard your elixir crucible.” He then sought the Western Immortal Source, where he obtained the *Summons to the Five Peaks* and the *Inner Writ of the Three Sovereigns*, summoning the myriad spirits and the secret texts of divine tigers within the Bilu Cave. He later journeyed to the stone chamber of Songshan, where he obtained the *Yellow Emperor’s Nine-Cauldron Elixir Book* and the *Great Clarity Elixir Canon*.\n\nHe declared: “In ancient times, when Yu pacified the floods, he eradicated calamity. Now, I must do the same.” Initially, he dwelled upon Yangping Mountain, where he was instructed in the method of passing through the warp of the scriptures. Next, he ascended Xicheng Mountain to pay homage to the Five Thearchs. Someone warned him: “The White Tiger Spirit of Xicheng drinks human blood, and a great serpent lurks above. If you perish, your merit, though nearly eternal, will be in vain. Now, the earth’s *Dao* is in disarray, and our efforts are futile. If we offer humans in sacrifice, the mountains and valleys will tremble, and springs will surge forth.” He then resided on Gezan Mountain, where he practiced the Nine Perfections’ method and the art of lightening the body, though his Daoist merits remained unfulfilled.\n\nHearing of the *sha qi* in Bashu, he obtained texts on entering and exiting water and fire, as well as the *Art of Nurturing the Spirit and Returning the Crane*, on Mingming Mountain. In the first year of *Han’an*, on the *shangyuan* festival of the *renwu* year, the Most High descended in a chariot drawn by five white dragons. He recalled: “In a former life, I expounded the scriptures to Yin Xi and refined the Ninefold Benefit Elixir on a mountain. When demonic plagues arose, I did not respond; instead, I erected an altar, summoned them, and admonished them.”\n\nIn Zizhou, *xu qi* emanated for several *li*, afflicting all who entered its midst. Among the mountains of Qin—Changli, Li, Choujie, Quting, and others—he declared: “Now, I command you to universally deliver all sentient beings. Here, I shall establish the Twenty-Four *Zhi*, dispatching immortal officials to oversee the world’s sins, blessings, life, and death. For countless kalpas, the Six Heavens’ bureaucracies have governed the blood sacrifices of ghosts and spirits, usurping their rightful places and blurring the boundary between humans and ghosts. You shall restore order.”\n\nHe then bestowed upon him the *Three-Five Capital Works* and various scriptural registers, followed by the *Three-Five Demon-Slaying Male and Female Swords*, the Jade Seal and Fish-Scale Robe, the *Crown of Intertwined Yin and Yang*, the *Jade Tablet of Heavenly Communication*, and said: “After a thousand days, we shall meet in the Celestial Park.” The Heavenly Master bowed in gratitude.\n\nOn the first day of the seventh month in the second year of *Han’an*, he ascended Qingcheng Mountain. The mountain harbored a ghost city, a ghost market, and ghostly multitudes divided into eight legions, each led by a ghostly chieftain, all preying upon the people. Upon his arrival, the ghostly chieftains and their followers confronted the Heavenly Master. With cinnabar ink, he inscribed the void, and the ghostly horde instantly collapsed. Summoning them back to life, he repelled some with wind-driven fire, dispersed others with sunlight piercing the mist, confined them beneath Mount Tai, or crushed them with boulders. The ghostly beings wailed, begging for mercy and pledging obedience.\n\nHe then commanded them to assemble at the Yellow Emperor’s altar on Qingcheng Mountain, decreeing that humans dwell in the light while ghosts remain in darkness. He swore: “From this day forth, when heaven and earth unite and the sun and moon conjoin, if you dare emerge again, I shall surely slay you.” He established the Twenty-Four *Zhi*, adding four more to correspond with the Twenty-Eight Constellations. The upright *qi* descended, linking the sixty cyclical years of human birth to each *Zhi*. For each, he appointed immortal officials, yin officials, and libationers to govern them. Those who were sincere, filial, loyal, and accumulated merit were recorded by the immortal officials for their goodness, while the rebellious, treacherous, greedy, and violent were noted by the yin officials for their sins. Thus, the retribution for good and evil became swift as an echo. The people of Shu turned toward cultivation.\n\nHe designated the Thirty-Six *Jinglu*, the Seventy-Two *Fudi*, and the Three Hundred Sixty Sacred Mountains, each with its own divine overseer. Returning to Yuntai, he said to his disciple Wang Chang: “A white *qi* arises from Yangshan—it is a demon. Go and subdue it.” En route, he encountered twelve divine maidens and inquired about the location of Xianquan. They replied: “Ahead lies a great torrent, where a poisonous dragon lurks.” He cast a talisman into the waters, and the demonic abode shrieked and fled. Turning back, he plunged his sword into the earth, creating a salt well.\n\nEach of the twelve maidens offered a jade ring, pledging to receive his talismanic writings. The Heavenly Master fused the twelve rings into one and cast it into the well, saying: “Whoever retrieves the ring shall have their wish granted.” The maidens vied to descend, but he sealed the well and swore: “Henceforth, you shall be the well’s spirits, never harming the people. If hunters encounter you on the path, admonish them not to kill.” He then taught them the method of boiling salt, and the people reaped its benefits. There, they established a Heavenly Master Temple, known as the Shrine of the Lord of Qinghe, which remains venerated to this day, with prayers offered without cease.\n\nPassing through Songjiang, he discerned a demon within the river. Inscribing a stone casket, he sealed it, and the demon was eradicated. Residing on Zhubu Mountain, a divine personage presented a jade disc at night. On Benzhu Mountain, the assembled perfected ones descended to bestow the *Scripture of Numinous Treasure*. On Mount Meng, he moved to Quting Mountain, and upon reaching Yuntai Mountain, he saw peaches ripening in a sheer ravine. He asked his disciples: “Who will descend to retrieve them?”\n\nZhao Sheng descended to retrieve the peaches and offered them to the Heavenly Master, then leapt down himself. Sheng and Chang followed in succession, whereupon the Heavenly Master bestowed upon them the divine elixir and the profound mysteries of the various scriptures.\n\nResiding on Liyuan Mountain, he established a platform for expounding the scriptures. On Lutang Mountain, he refined the nine-cycled divine elixir. On Pinggai Mountain, he compounded the great Nine Radiance medicine. Arriving in Chengdu, the earth yielded the Jade Bureau Examiner, who descended once more to expound the essentials of the scriptures.\n\nIn the second year of Yongshou, while traveling on Quting Mountain, he received the Jade Register from the Most High, who ordained him as the Boundless, Lofty, and Illustrious Great Emperor of the Six Harmonies. Thereafter, the Most High designated him as the grandson of the sixth generation of the Dao, with the Young Lord of the Eastern Sea as his guarantor, the Most High as his preceptor, and conferred upon Daoling the title of Heavenly Master. Three hundred disciples were initiated, though only three were appointed to succeed in governance: Zhang Shen, Wang Sheng, and Li Zhong.\n\nHe then entrusted the scriptural records, seal, and sword to his son Heng, admonishing him: “I received the Supreme Dao directly from the Most High. These texts encompass the Three and Five Steps and the Pivotal Essentials of the Orthodox Unity. Let this transmission pass to one son in each generation; it shall not be imparted to those outside our lineage.”\n\nOn that day, he bestowed the elixir upon Chang and Sheng, dividing it for consumption on Yuntai Peak. Together with his wife, Lady Yong, he ascended on clouds, having dwelt among mortals for one hundred and twenty-three years. Wang Chang and Zhao Sheng attended him, while his daughters—Wenji, Wenguang, Xianji, and Fangzhi—all attained the Dao and ascended.\n\nIn the seventh year of Tianbao, an imperial edict of the Later Han posthumously enfeoffed Heavenly Master Zhang Daoling as Grand Preceptor. In the fourth year of Zhonghe of the Tang, he was honored as the Great Dharma Master of the Three Heavens Who Upholds the Teachings. During the Shaoxing era of the Song, he was further titled the Great Dharma Master of the Three Heavens Who Upholds the Teachings and Assists the Primordial.\n\nEmperor Xuanzong of the Tang composed this eulogy:\n“In that distant Han dynasty, the celestial mandate faltered,\nAll things withered, the Three Spirits dissolved in chaos.\nOnly the Master arose in response,\nHis divine might swiftly manifest.\nHe personally attended the Mysterious Origin,\nReceiving the transmission of secret teachings.\nLike clouds, demonic toxins were dispelled;\nWith a sword, mountains of evil were cloven.\nHe broadly propagated the sacred teachings,\nPurging all accumulated malevolence.\nA single flourish of non-action,\nEver radiant, boundless in efficacy.\nPhoenix and crane soared beyond,\nHis likeness preserved in vermilion and azure.\nThe jade countenance of the perfected,\nHis fragrant legacy unceasing.”\n\nAnother eulogy reads:\n“Remote was the true immortal,\nSolitary in lofty integrity.\nHis qi pierced the vault of heaven;\nThe Mysterious Origin revealed its secrets.\nHis divine bearing, resplendent,\nStood like the bright moon aloft.\nHe executed the perverse, severed the demonic,\nDrove away specters, banished ghosts.\nIn the Han, he established the Alliance of Might,\nIts transmission unbroken to this day.”\n\nEmperor Suzong of the Tang composed this eulogy:\n“Virtue arises from purity and emptiness,\nThe essence of the sagely teachings.\nNow hidden, now manifest,\nSimple and unadorned.\nAbiding in jade towers,\nBurning incense in chambers of jade,\nHis Dao-heart unwavering—\nThis is the Orthodox Unity.”\n\nEmperor Huizong of the Song issued a jade register for the Perfected Lord, stating:\n“In the second year of Daguan, the cyclical year *wuzǐ*, on the sixteenth day of the tenth month, *rénchén*, the Emperor, with reverence, proclaims:\nThe Dao is without limit,\nYet relies on humanity to be enacted.\nWhen actions are enslaved by things,\nThey depend on people to be fulfilled.\nOf old, the utmost perfected ones\nEmployed the Dao to transform the age,\nTheir merit pervading all things,\nThus becoming divine and luminous.\nHow could one not revere and honor\nSuch surpassing excellence?\nThe Orthodox Unity Perfected Man, Great Dharma Master of the Three Heavens Who Upholds the Teachings and Assists the Primordial, embodied the wondrous and expounded the mysterious, bringing great benefit to the world. In the latter days of the Liu dynasty, his deeds flourished. Thereafter, he harnessed radiance and light, transcending the mortal realm. The True Chart of Autumn Threads was transmitted to posterity, eradicating calamities and misfortunes, warding off inauspicious omens. In obscurity, he aided the common people, his fame enduring and ever more illustrious. Without a fitting title, how could his recompense be complete? Thus, we bestow this honor to extol his virtuous grace.\n\nWith reverence, we dispatch the *Chaofeng Dafu* and Prefect of Xinzhou, Liu Yan, to confer the honorific title: *Perfected Lord of Orthodox Unity Who Pacifies and Responds*.\nThe Dao, though hidden in mystery,\nIs manifest in clarity.\nIts merit swiftly bestowed,\nIts glory near at hand.\nThis is not of our own doing,\nBut through constancy unceasing.\nMay you observe this,\nAnd further practice its residue,\nBlessing our state and household,\nExtending to our people,\nThat boundless prosperity may flourish,\nAnd endure for generations unending.”\n\nEmperor Lizong of the Song issued this decree:\n“The Daoist school takes purity, stillness, and non-action as its foundation. Talismanic registers, cinnabar elixirs, breath cultivation, and ritual offerings are its ancestral methods. That its adherents are deeply devoted is no wonder, for it guides people to repent their transgressions and incline toward goodness—is this not an aid to the teachings of names and the governance of the Dao?\nThe Great Dharma Master of the Three Heavens Who Upholds the Teachings and Assists the Primordial, Perfected Lord of Orthodox Unity Who Pacifies and Responds, received his mandate from the celestial realms and was born in the Han dynasty. Cultivating truth and refining conduct, he ascended on clouds. The Twenty-Four Treatments, his vow on Qingcheng to subdue demons with a brush, the transformation of three ants into a salt spring—these numinous traces in Shu cannot be denied. Shangrao’s Dragon-Tiger Mountain is said to be his former abode, where the jade seal and sacred sword have been transmitted through generations. Recently, when the capital suffered drought and tidal surges, earnest prayers brought swift response, truly a manifestation of hidden blessings. Yet some scholars, clinging to ancient histories, dismiss these wonders with scorn, unaware that the constant goodness of saving people leaves none abandoned. Is this not akin to the heart of compassion, the wellspring of benevolence? Following his former titles, we now add a laudatory epithet, that all may reverently uphold his legacy. Let him be honored as the Great Dharma Master of the Three Heavens Who Upholds the Teachings, Assists the Primordial, and Manifests Blessings, Perfected Lord of Orthodox Unity.”\n\nEmperor Chengzong of the Yuan issued this decree:\n“Our dynasty, with utmost benevolence and supreme virtue, has never forgotten the legacy and numinous influence of the Ancestral Heavenly Master. As recorded in the annals, upon examining ancient precedents, we now bestow an additional honorific: Great Dharma Master of the Three Heavens Who Upholds the Teachings, Assists the Primordial, and Pacifies Responses, Perfected Lord Who Manifests Blessings.\nRefining qi to attain perfection,\nDispelling evil and aiding the upright,\nHe has been a model for the world\nFor over twelve hundred years.\nThe seal and sword, transmitted through a single line,\nNow rest with the thirty-seventh generation.\nHis descendants, like branches of a tree,\nHave faithfully upheld the true Dharma.\nMaster Zong Liusun has enriched the ancestral enterprise.\nThough the Dao originates in non-action,\nNo virtue is greater than honoring what is distant.”\n\nAs the times reveal, we record what was once heard.\nThe transmission of scriptures began in the early years of Han Emperor Yongshu, in the first month of the yiwei year. The conferral of posthumous titles in this Yuan Emperor Zhenzong’s reign, likewise an jiazi year, seems ordained by fate, yet we pray for the perpetuation of this legacy. Thus, we bestow an additional honorific: Perfected Lord of the Orthodox Unity Who Embodies the Subtle, Transforms Through the Numinous, Pacifies Responses, and Manifests Blessings.\nThis marks the first generation of Heavenly Masters.\n\nThe second-generation successor, named Heng, styled Lingzhen,\nDedicated himself to the perfection of the supreme Dao, refusing to engage with the world.\nSummoned to serve as Gentleman of the Yellow Gate, he declined.\nIn the second year of Yongshu, he inherited the teachings and resided on Mount Yangping, annually transmitting scriptures and registers to his disciples, thereby illuminating the Way of Orthodox Unity.\nHis words were concise, his principles luminous; all who heard were moved.\n\nIn the first month of the jiwei year of Han Emperor Yuanhe, he entrusted the seal and sword to his son Lu, saying:\n“Your ancestor took heaven and earth as his heart, all living beings as his concern, sincerity, reverence, loyalty, and filial piety as his foundation. He traversed the world, eradicating malevolent spirits that harmed the people, and thus encountered the sagely master, establishing the great teaching.\nThose who inherit my Way must possess sincerity to attain the Dao, reverence to cultivate virtue, loyalty to serve their lord, and filial piety to serve their parents.\nYou must transmit these teachings in succession, upholding human ethics and abiding by established instructions.”\n\nThereupon, he led his disciples in obeisance, declaring:\n“The aspirations of our ancestral master were vast, founding the teaching upon the family to serve as an eternal model. As one whose body inherits the Dharma, charged with carrying forward the legacy, the task is arduous. How dare I not exert myself to propagate the subtle transformation?”\n\nHaving spoken, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight with his wife, née Lu, upon Mount Yangping.\n\nIn the first year of the Zhida era of the Great Yuan, Emperor Wuzong decreed:\n“Of the ancient sage-kings, none failed to take tranquility and the pacification of the people as their foundation. Lord Gongsun sought the Great Dao in the Yuan Garden; Emperor Yao journeyed to the Fen River—all to broadly pursue the supreme principle for the realm. I deeply admire this.\nThe teachings of the Heavenly Master of Orthodox Unity approach this ideal.\nNow, the officials have petitioned for the conferral of a title upon the successor. Though the successor embodies the vessel of the Dao, renouncing worldly honors and embracing simplicity, and though he finds no need for titles, the continuation of the ancestral enterprise and the guidance of the people toward goodness must not go unmarked.\nThus, let a distinguished honor be bestowed to inspire reverence from afar.\nWe posthumously grant the title: Perfected Lord of the Great Clarity Who Propagates the Teachings and Illuminates the Dao, to the Successor of Orthodox Unity.”\n\nThe third-generation lineage master, named Lu, styled Gongqi, was the eldest son of the successor.\nFrom youth, he upheld his ancestor’s instructions. As the Han dynasty’s fortunes waned and the Central Plains fell into chaos, his homeland trembled.\nHe often recruited righteous men for protection, guiding them with the teachings of the Dao, and the number of followers grew ever greater.\n\nTo those who came to study, he taught sincerity, reverence, and the avoidance of deceit. For those afflicted by illness, he instructed them to confess their transgressions. He established the office of *jijiu*, and those who recovered and could follow the rules were made to wear scripture cords, leading them toward goodness until, in time, they transformed themselves. At the time, he was appointed by imperial decree as Colonel Director of Agriculture, General Who Pacifies the People, and Prefect of Hanzhong. When Liu Bei conquered Shu, harboring ambitions of disloyalty, he requested the Heavenly Master to serve as Supervisor of Righteousness and Marshal. Thereupon, the master withdrew to Hanzhong, amassing vast stores of grain. The court then appointed him Governor of Hanzhong and Nanzheng. Before long, the armies of Qin and Yong revolted, plotting to enthrone the Heavenly Master as king of Hanzhong, but he firmly resisted. Soon after, the forces of Wei pressed upon him, so he sealed the treasuries and retired to the Southern Mountains. When Cao Cao led his troops into Nanzheng and saw the well-stocked treasuries, recognizing no ill intent, he greatly admired him. With humble words, he sent envoys to console and instruct, appointing him Inspector of Liang and Yi Provinces, granting the title General Who Guards the South, Marquis Within the Passes, with a fief of thirty thousand households. The master firmly declined, saying to the envoy: “I am a cultivator of the Dao, and my generation aspires to transcendence. The enfeoffment of lands is not my desire.” He requested the return of the seals and ribbons. One day, he summoned his heir, Sheng, and entrusted him with the scripture cords, sword, and seals, saying: “At Dragon-Tiger Mountain lies the ancestral altar of the Perfected. That land is illuminated by celestial stars and suffused with concentrated earthly *qi*, a dwelling place of gods and immortals. The secret texts of the cinnabar cauldron are hidden within its caverns. You must go forth to propagate my teachings, cultivating and accumulating merit.” Thereupon, he ascended from the peak of the Northern Dipper.\n\nThe younger brother Wei, styled Gongze, served as General of Illustrious Righteousness before resigning his post to study the Dao, ascending in broad daylight. The younger brother Kui, styled Gongren, was enfeoffed as Governor of Nanjun, granted the title of Attendant-in-Ordinary to the Imperial Son-in-Law, and likewise resigned his post to study the Dao, ascending in broad daylight. He had five sons—Yan Pu and others—all of whom were enfeoffed as marquises, yet none accepted the honors.\n\nEmperor Yuan of the Great Cheng issued an edict, saying: “We consider that the great origin of the Dao emerges from Heaven, yet its completion lies with man. The lineage of the Celestial Master of Han is long established; were it not for his descendants’ unceasing succession of virtuous inheritance, how could its grandeur be thus perpetuated? Therefore, in every generation, extraordinary persons have emerged to aid in governance and transformation. Having already bestowed titles upon the succeeding master, We now reflect upon the late master’s illustrious conduct, mourning his luminous virtue recorded in the annals. He withdrew of his own accord, achieving merit without attachment. Does not the scripture say: ‘The highest virtue does not act as virtue, and thus possesses virtue’? Let him be posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Orthodox Unity, Grand Illuminator of the Great Clarity, and Broad Virtue.”\n\nThe fourth-generation Celestial Master, named Sheng and styled Yuanzong, was the third son of the late master. Initially residing in Nanzheng, he devoted himself to rigorous cultivation. At his father’s command, he succeeded the teachings. Emperor Shizu of Wei enfeoffed him as Commandant of the Imperial Carriage, Gentleman Cavalier Attendant, and added the title of Marquis of Duting.\n\nHe declined the honors. Carrying the sword, seal, scriptures, and registers, he returned from Hanzhong to Poyang, then entered Longhu Mountain, where he discovered the former altar site of the Ancestral Celestial Master and the ancient cinnabar terrace. He settled there and, on the Three Primordial Days, personally ascended the altar to transmit the registers, bestowing them upon disciples from all directions. Those who came to study the Dao numbered over a thousand. From this time onward, he established ritual protocols, making them the standard practice. He entrusted the sword and seal to his son, Zhaocheng, thereby manifesting the transformative power of his teachings. Before his years were fulfilled, he again traveled to Hezhou in Guangxi to perform rituals for the Prince of Guang. To others, he remarked: “From the Crane Cry Mountains of western Shu to the Dragon-Tiger Mountains of eastern Wu, my meritorious practice now complete, I journey once more through the southern lands.” In the first year of the Zhizheng era of the Yuan dynasty, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Luminous Teachings and Vast Virtue of the Qingwei Tradition.\n\nThe fifth-generation Celestial Master, named Zhaocheng and styled Daorong, was the eldest son of Yuanzong. From youth, he pursued the Dao with unwavering diligence. Often seated in meditation within a chamber, his spirit would wander hundreds of *li* afar, and tigers and leopards that encountered him would crouch in submission. He lived to the age of one hundred and nineteen before transforming, his complexion remaining as though alive. A hundred stalks of *lingzhi* mushrooms sprouted at his grave, and some witnessed white cranes coming and going. When his coffin was later opened, only his cap and shoes remained. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era of the Yuan dynasty, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Vast Teachings and Illuminating Dao of the Qingwei Tradition.\n\nThe sixth-generation Celestial Master, named Shu and styled Dexin, was broadly versed in Confucian texts. Emperor An repeatedly summoned him, but he declined to serve. Once, while traveling on Poyang Lake, on a moonlit night, an elderly man boarded his boat and addressed him: “I have heard that your esteemed lineage has established its teachings upon the immortal Dao, and I long to pay homage, yet I have no means to approach. Tonight, by unexpected fortune, your transcendent presence has graced these shores, and I am blessed to behold your radiant countenance. I humbly beseech you to reveal the profound mysteries and dispel my ignorance.” The Celestial Master replied: “In ancient times, those who attained the Dao all entered through the gateway of precepts. Yet to lodge the mind in the precepts is not as profound as lodging the precepts in the mind. When the myriad dharmas are all empty, the One True Nature abides eternally. Do you comprehend this?” The old man rose, expressed his gratitude, and departed. Some of the Celestial Master’s followers witnessed a strange light, the water and sky merging as one, unaware of where the old man had gone. The Celestial Master smiled and said: “This was the Dragon Elder, who governs the aquatic tribes. Having never heard the Great Dao, he came to make this request.” While residing on the mountain, he manifested many numinous signs. Having lived over a hundred years, he departed through *shijie*. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era of the Yuan dynasty, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Mysterious Wonder and Vast Teachings of the Qingwei Tradition.\n\nThe seventh-generation Celestial Master, named Hui and styled Zhongchang, as soon as he could speak, asked what the Dao was. When none could answer, he sighed with a rueful smile. At the age of five, he wished to receive the scriptures and registers, but his father said: “First study the Confucian texts.” He replied: “If I do not study the ancestral texts, what use is there in reading others?” At ten, he succeeded the teachings. He was able to abstain from grain and could travel hundreds of *li* in a day. Later, he entered Mount Qingcheng and vanished without a trace. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era of the Yuan dynasty, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Assisting Teachings and Vast Salvation of the Yuqing Tradition.\n\nThe eighth-generation Celestial Master, named Jiong and styled Yanchao, from childhood attained the Dao. His bearing was noble and handsome, his virtue and magnanimity innate. His utmost sincerity transformed all. Those who sought his prayers, regardless of status, were never refused, and divine responses invariably followed.\n\nEmperor Taizu of Wei once summoned him to the imperial court to inquire about the Dao. At ninety years of age, on the day of his transformation, an extraordinary fragrance filled the chamber and lingered for a month without dissipating. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era of the Yuan dynasty, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Responding Transformation and Tranquil Emptiness of the Yuqing Tradition.\n\nThe ninth-generation Celestial Master, named Fu and styled Dexin, was solemn, upright, and perspicacious. Whatever Confucian classics, histories, or ancestral texts he perused, he could recite from memory after a single reading. His scriptures and registers were renowned in his time, and he was revered throughout the land. He transformed at the age of ninety-three. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Assisting Transformation and Lofty Mystery of the Yuqing Tradition.\n\nThe tenth-generation Celestial Master, named Zixiang and styled Linbo, served the Sui dynasty as a magistrate in Luoyang. He resigned his post to succeed the teachings, refining his diet and inner alchemy. He could exhale cinnabar, place it in his palm, and its radiance would shine beyond the door; soon after, he would swallow it again. Once, while traveling through the Yellow River and Luo River regions, he ascended the central peak of Mount Song and lodged in a stone chamber, delighting in its seclusion. One night, he suddenly heard the sound of soldiers and horses. Two divine officials, passing through on their way to pay respects to the Lord of the Eastern Marchmount, sought an audience with the Celestial Master. The Lord said: “I once met the Sagely Master at Mount Qingcheng, and now over four hundred years have passed. Since the Wei and Jin dynasties, the land has long been ravaged by chaos, and the people have suffered, their karmic debts entangled without hope of liberation. Now, by fortune, the Marchmount’s administration has encountered the Sagely Master again. I humbly beseech you to widely propagate the registers and talismans, that they may aid in deliverance.” With these words, they took their leave. The Celestial Master returned to the mountain and dispatched his disciples to propagate the teachings in all directions, accumulating merit in the mysterious work. He transformed at the age of one hundred and twenty. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Supreme Mystery and Great Emptiness of the Shangqing Tradition.\n\nThe eleventh-generation Celestial Master, named Tongxuan and styled Zhongda, was by nature tranquil and reticent. He often sat alone in a chamber and would not emerge except at the proper time; even his attendants seldom saw him. During a great epidemic, he planted a staff in water, and all who drew and drank from it were cured. When people brought silk in gratitude, he declined, saying: “My ancestors aided others—how could I accept thanks?” Those seeking talismans gathered in throngs, and those receiving scriptures and registers grew ever more numerous. He transformed at the age of ninety-seven. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Mysterious Response and Harmonious Emptiness of the Shangqing Tradition.\n\nThe twelfth-generation Celestial Master, named Heng and styled Derun, could peruse classics and histories without ever forgetting them. Emperor Gaozong of Tang dispatched an emissary to summon him and inquired about the Dao of governing the state and pacifying the people.\n\nHe replied: “If one can practice non-action, then even the most cunning and artful among us immortals in heaven would be surpassed.” One day, he secretly returned from the palace and sighed, saying: “I nearly fell into the snare of the world.” He studied the Dao at home, once placing a jar in his chamber while eating meat and drinking wine with his wife and children. When he opened the jar at night, all its contents were found intact within the porcelain vessel, remaining unspoiled for days. He transformed at the age of ninety-eight. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Mysterious Virtue and Grand Harmony of the Shangqing Tradition.\n\nThe thirteenth-generation Celestial Master, named Guang and styled Deshao, was steadfast in his devotion to the Dao. He cultivated and refined himself in a stone chamber for nearly thirty years. Only upon succeeding to the teaching did he return home. In transmitting scriptures and registers, he ordinarily ate only vegetables, later mastering the art of grain avoidance. He transformed at the age of one hundred and four. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Supreme Mystery, Utmost Virtue, and Vast Wonder.\n\nHis youngest son, named Wu and styled Junming, cultivated the Dao from childhood. He could avoid grain and fly in travel, his ultimate fate unknown.\n\nThe fourteenth-generation Celestial Master, named Cizheng and styled Ziming, was keen of wisdom and insight. He often taught others through the principles of the *Yijing*, and followers gathered in throngs. Whenever he had surplus wealth, he immediately relieved the poor and needy. He abandoned his wife to cultivate the Dao in the mountains, ascending Shengjing Mountain, where he built a hut and lived in solitude.\n\nEach year on the Three Yuan Days, he would emerge from the mountains to transmit the scriptures and registers. The imperial court repeatedly summoned him, but he never responded. Over a hundred years later, he transformed, and celestial music was heard descending from the void to welcome him. Today, Shengjing Mountain is called Master Summoned-by-the-Court Mountain, and the stream is called Master Summoned-by-the-Court Gully. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era of the Yuan dynasty, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Supreme Mystery, Upper Virtue, and Purple Void.\n\nThe fifteenth-generation Celestial Master, named Gao and styled Shilong, possessed a bearing of transcendent spaciousness. Fond of wine, he could drink a *dan* without becoming drunk. Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang summoned him for an audience and commanded him to establish an altar in the capital to transmit the registers, bestowing upon him gold and silk, exempting him from taxes, and conferring the title of Celestial Master of the Han Ancestor. Emperor Suzong sent incense and silk, held a grand jiao ritual in the mountains, and presented an imperial calligraphic inscription to eulogize the Celestial Master’s portrait. Once, he left his jade seal in a Chang’an wineshop, and though a young man tried to lift it with all his strength, he could not move it. The next day, the Celestial Master arrived, laughed, and carried it away. He transformed at the age of ninety-three. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Supreme Mystery, Revered Virtue, and Mysterious Transformation.\n\nThe sixteenth-generation Celestial Master, named Yingzhao and styled Zhifeng, after inheriting the teaching, entrusted his son with the sword and seal and retired to the southern mountains above Dragon Beard Well, where he tilled the land for his own delight. Often, he would sit on a rock by the well and play an iron flute, its sound carrying for miles. One day, he suspended himself over the deep well, sat upright, and transformed. He was buried beside the well. Today, there remains the Immortal’s Tomb, with a stone gate framed by intertwined trees. The land he cultivated is called Yellow Sand Gully. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Cavernous Void, Evolving Dao, and Pure Simplicity.\n\nThe seventeenth-generation Celestial Master, named Shun and styled Zhongfu, was supremely filial. When his mother fell ill for ten days, he did not remove his sash for a month. He often said to others: “Those who are neither loyal nor filial yet seek to study the Dao and aspire to immortality are like abandoning their oars and crossing a great river.” Initially serving as the magistrate of Guishui, he resigned his post to inherit the teaching, bringing his wife and children to dwell in a thatched hut in the mountains. He transformed at the age of eighty-seven. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Cavernous Void, Propagating the Teaching, and Faithfully Protective.\n\nThe eighteenth-generation Celestial Master, named Shiyuan and styled Zhongliang, was gaunt and heavily bearded. He dwelled on Yingtian Mountain for forty years. The mountain was home to many tigers, and no one dared to visit him. Only on the Three Yuan Days would he descend the mountain to transmit the registers. During great winds and rains, he was sometimes seen wearing a dark cap, riding a black tiger as he traversed the peaks—those who witnessed this knew him to be the Celestial Master. Today, to the south of the mountain stands the Cinnabar Hut, and to the north lie the Scripture-Translating Stone, Black Dragon Well, and Azure Lotus Pond, all his vestiges. He transformed at the age of ninety-two. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Cavernous Void, Illuminating the Dao, and Assisting the Turning of the Kalpa.\n\nThe nineteenth-generation Celestial Master, named Xiu and styled Dezhen, was of simple and unadorned nature, tilling the fields himself. When those afflicted with illness came to him, he would inscribe talismans on leaves to treat them, and they would immediately recover. Whenever he transmitted registers to those who had attained them, he would distribute them freely to others. A wealthy merchant from Jiangxi named Liu Qian once received registers from him. One day, Liu died in Jinling but revived two days later. He recounted being seized by the underworld authorities and encountering a divine official on the road, who said: “Since you have long received the registers, though your death is due, you may extend your life by two cycles.” Thereupon, Liu entered the mountains and became a disciple. One day, the Celestial Master gathered his disciples and said: “I shall transform on such-and-such a day.” When the day arrived, he bathed, changed his clothes, sat upright, and transformed. He was eighty-five years old. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Mysterious Void, Resplendent Transformation, and Illustrious Blessing.\n\nThe twentieth-generation Celestial Master, named Chen and styled Zijian, was summoned by Emperor Wuzong of the Tang during the Xinyou year of the Huichang era. The emperor bestowed upon him the plaque “True Immortal Abbey” for the altar where he transmitted the registers. When the court sought to appoint him to an official post, he declined and returned home. During the Xiantong era, Emperor Yizong commanded the construction of a grand Golden Register jiao ritual, bestowed gold ingots, and allowed him to return to the mountains.\n\nOne day, he transformed in a state of profound intoxication. Having lived over a hundred years, in the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Mysterious Void, Grotto-Realized, and Faithful Virtue.\n\nThe twenty-first-generation Celestial Master, named Bingyi and styled Wenfu, was conceived when his mother, napping in daylight, dreamed of a divine being descending upon a golden tortoise. Upon waking, she found herself with child, and after fifteen months, gave birth. As he grew, his eyes flashed like lightning, and he could see clearly at night. Often carrying a sword through mountains and marshes, he once shouted at an ancient tree, and thunder immediately split it asunder, striking dead two giant pythons and over a hundred smaller serpents. The Prince of Qi of Southern Tang dreamed he had fallen into a well, from which a Daoist with emerald eyes and a long beard, clad in crimson robes, lifted him out. Diviners declared, \"This is the Han Celestial Master.\" Thereupon, the prince journeyed to Mount Longhu, built a shrine, and bestowed water fields. When the Celestial Master was about to transform, he said, \"I depart now—soon the earth will quake.\" After his passing, the ground indeed trembled, and he was not encoffined until seven days later. His body remained warm as jade, and he lived to ninety-two. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Guarding the Mysterious, Purple Culmen, and Illustrious Transformation.\n\nThe twenty-second-generation Celestial Master, named Shan and styled Yuanchang, abstained from meat from childhood. As he grew older, he wandered through famous mountains for over thirty years before finally returning. In profound silence, he cultivated inwardly.\n\nHe did not engage with worldly affairs and lived to eighty-seven. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Pure Emptiness, Lofty Response, and Faithful Benevolence.\n\nThe twenty-third-generation Celestial Master, named Jiwen and styled Zhonggui, saw many receive his registers and scriptures during the late Five Dynasties period. He thus cast iron tally contracts to continue the tradition. At the beginning of the Song dynasty, the practice of iron tally registers flourished even more. He lived to eighty-seven. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Pure Emptiness, Wondrous Dao, and State-Aiding Salvation.\n\nThe twenty-fourth-generation Celestial Master, named Zhengsui and styled Baoshen, was upright, honest, and unadorned by nature, refraining from mingling with common society. In the eighth year of the Dazhong Xiangfu era of the Song dynasty (the year *yimao*), he was summoned to court. Minister of Personnel Wang Qinruo memorialized the throne on his behalf, and he was immediately appointed as Director of the Bureau of Registers. Additionally, the True Immortal Abbey was renamed the Abbey of Supreme Purity. He passed away at the age of eighty-seven. Emperor Zhenzong of the Song composed an edict that read:\n\n*\"I, heir to the ancestral altars, revere and honor the celestial Dao. Bearing the auspicious responses of Heaven and Earth and unfolding the treasured talismans of the Yellow and Luo Rivers, I wish to share in the wondrous Dao with perfected beings. Your ancestor received the divine transmission at the Golden Portal and passed down the dharma lineage to later generations. You, as his direct descendant, have inherited this extraordinary learning, unlocking the secrets of prior Heaven to guide the people toward enlightenment. As the imperial gaze observes, may the world ascend to benevolence and longevity. Thus, I bestow upon you a noble title to further propagate the mysterious principles, granting you the honorific ‘Master of True Stillness.’\"*\n\nIn the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Pure Emptiness, Vast Teaching, and Wondrous Salvation.\n\nThe twenty-fifth-generation Celestial Master, named Qianyao and styled Yuanguang, was solemn, quiet, and sparing of words, steadfastly devoted to inner cultivation. In the eighth year of the Tiansheng era of the Song dynasty, Emperor Renzong summoned him to court and inquired about the matters of ascending through emptiness.\n\nHe replied, \"This cannot serve to aid governance and teaching. If Your Majesty returns to simplicity and practices ease, the world will attain peace—why then pursue ascending through emptiness?\" The emperor praised his words and bestowed upon him the honorific \"Master of Clarity and Simplicity.\"\n\nThe emperor further inquired, \"How many sons do you have?\"\nHe answered, \"My eldest son transmits the Dao; the second pursues Confucian studies.\" Thereupon, the emperor appointed his second son, Jiansu, as a general and later as Registrar of the Palace Guard. Though Jiansu held office, his heart ever yearned for the Dao. As a guard commander, he retired to seclusion by the shores of Poyang’s East Lake, where his descendants reside to this day.\n\nThe Celestial Master passed at the age of eighty-five, his sword resting in Renfu Township, Zhangbu, Caojiayuan.\n\nEmperor Renzong of the Song issued an edict:\n\"Since ascending the throne, I have devoted myself to the supreme Dao. Consider the Yellow Emperor, who nurtured the people, regulated yin and yang, and achieved governance through non-action. There was Guangchengzi upon Mount Kongtong, who, for the sake of the people, did not hesitate to crawl forward and humbly inquire. You have come a thousand *li* to the imperial capital and, with a single word, awakened me to the essentials of nurturing life and governing the people. How could I withhold a noble title to honor your distinction? May you widely propagate the numinous transformation, fulfilling my intent to summon and extend such wisdom, lest Guangchengzi alone be celebrated in antiquity.\" Thus, he was granted the honorific \"Master of Clarity and Simplicity.\"\n\nIn the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Sublime Mystery, Universal Salvation, and Profound Stillness.\n\nThe twenty-sixth Celestial Master, named Sizong and styled Rongzu, was born with a seal-like mark on his left palm. Upon inheriting the teaching, his divine marvels became fully manifest. In the second year of the Zhihe era (a *jiwei* year), Emperor Renzong summoned him to court. His prayers proved efficacious, and he was ordered to relocate the Upper Clarity Abbey to the southern slope of the mountain. At seventy-eight, his countenance remained youthful. He was granted the honorific \"Master of Empty Whiteness\" and passed at the age of eighty-one, his sword resting at Ruokou Stockade.\n\nEmperor Renzong of the Song issued an edict:\n\"Offering sacrifices to the mountains and rivers marks the beginning of ritual prayer. The affairs of the imperial retreat are not to be entrusted to shamans or historians. Yet if sincerity reaches beyond, it becomes a reliance for governing the age. Zhang Sizong, sixteenth-generation descendant of the Han Celestial Master, has inherited the family learning and emulated his ancestors’ virtue. When he revealed his judgments to Heaven, disasters swiftly turned to blessings. Without a heart devoted to the Dao, unified in utmost sincerity, could such wonders occur? From emptiness arises whiteness; auspiciousness abides in stillness—these are yours alone.\" Thus, he was granted the honorific \"Master of Empty Whiteness.\"\n\nIn the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Sublime Truth, Universal Transformation, and Wondrous Awakening.\n\nThe twenty-seventh Celestial Master, named Xiangzhong and styled Gongchen, could walk at three months and speak at five.\n\nAt seven, he was summoned to court, granted a purple robe, and appointed to succeed the teaching. The emperor granted him an audience to inquire of the Dao, and his responses greatly pleased the throne. The emperor bestowed upon him an imperial brush inscription, which he later took back to Zhenjun Mountain’s Wuzhu Pond, where he built a hut to dwell. There, he attained the Dao and ascended in emptiness, leaving behind the Seven Stars Mound and White Crane Hollow. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Sublime Truth, Universal Kindness, and Purple Mystery.\n\nThe twenty-eighth Celestial Master, named Dunfu and styled Yanzhi, possessed innate learning and a voice like a great bell, earning the admiration of scholars. During the Xining reign of the Song, Emperor Shenzong summoned him to court and commanded him to perform a jiao ritual in the inner palace, bestowing upon him the honorific \"Master of Preserved Radiance.\" He passed away at fifty-three, and his sword transformed into a rainbow at Dengjia Hollow. Emperor Shenzong of the Song composed an edict, saying:\n\n*\"Bearing the favor of Heaven and Earth and relying on the accumulated achievements of my ancestors, the realm enjoys peace, and the people prosper. I seek to propagate the wind of purity and stillness, that all may delight in governance through non-action. Zhang Dunfu, twenty-eighth-generation descendant of the Han Celestial Master, inherited the ancestral seal and early grasped the true essence. Though he swiftly departed for the cinnabar hills, never to return to the Hall of Audience, it is fitting to inscribe his name in the records and adorn him with rosy clouds. Thus, he is granted the honorific 'Master of Preserved Radiance.'\"*\n\nIn the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of the Supreme Ultimate, Non-Action, and Daoist Evolution.\n\n*End of Scroll Two of the Genealogy of the Han Celestial Masters*\n*Scroll Three of the Genealogy of the Han Celestial Masters*\n\nThe twenty-ninth-generation Celestial Master, named Jingduan, courtesy name Ziren, was the nephew of Dunfu. By nature serene and indifferent, he renounced desires and never contended with worldly affairs, devoting himself wholeheartedly to the study of the mysterious Dao. In the second year of the Daguan era, he was posthumously honored as \"Master of Preserved Authenticity.\" He transcended at the age of fifty-two.\n\nAn edict of Emperor Huizong of Song declared: \"I consider the averting of disasters and defense against calamities to be foremost in sacrificial rites, while the exaltation of virtue and requital of merit are what sages esteem. Recently, Master of Empty Stillness Zhang Jixian quelled the malevolent vapors of the salt marshes and concealed his memorials of the Jiao rites within the Golden Court. His responses were as swift as echoes, and his merits were most eminent. Tracing their origin, these achievements stem from his familial learning. Yet I find the title bestowed upon you inadequate; thus, I specially confer the honorific 'Master of Preserved Authenticity.'\" In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of the Supreme Ultimate, Pure Emptiness, and Compassionate Wonder.\n\nThe thirtieth-generation Celestial Master, named Jixian, courtesy name Jiawen, also styled Daozheng, and known by the sobriquet Master of Sudden Enlightenment, was the great-grandson of the twenty-seventh-generation Celestial Master. His grandfather was Dunxin, and his father, Churen, served the Song as magistrate of Linchuan County. He was born on the twentieth day of the tenth month in the renshen year of the seventh Yuanyou era (1092) at Menggu Hermitage.\n\nAt the age of five, he remained silent, but one day, upon hearing a rooster crow, he suddenly laughed and composed a poem: \"The numinous phoenix possesses five virtues, / Its crest and spurs ever upon its form. / At the fifth watch, it opens wide its beak, / To awaken those lost in dreams.\" The following day, he sat in meditation upon a blue lotus, and all who witnessed it marveled, declaring him a true immortal. The Pool of the Bathing Immortal at the present-day Yuxian Abbey remains as testament.\n\nAt nine, he succeeded to the teaching. In the second year of the Chongning era, Xiezhou reported that the salt ponds had overflowed. The emperor sought counsel from the Daoist Xu Shenweng, who replied, \"A flood-dragon’s spawn is causing harm; the Celestial Master Zhang should be summoned.\" The court was ordered to extend an invitation. The next year, he journeyed to the capital and was received in audience. The emperor asked, \"You dwell on Mount Longhu—have you ever seen dragons and tigers?\" He replied, \"Living on the mountain, tigers are often seen, but today I behold the dragon countenance for the first time.\" The emperor was pleased and commanded him to draft a talisman. Upon receiving it, the emperor smiled and asked, \"From whence comes its numinosity?\" He answered, \"Where the spirit resides, numinosity naturally follows.\"\n\nThe emperor then asked if he could write, to which he replied, \"Your servant has transcribed the *Dao De Jing*.\" The emperor requested it, and upon receiving the text, inquired about the art of elixir refinement. He responded, \"This is the work of rustics, not a pursuit befitting a sovereign. Your Majesty’s practice of clarity and non-action is already the equal of Yao and Shun.\" The emperor was delighted. As he accompanied the emperor into the inner palace, courtiers clamored for him to inscribe their fans. He wrote upon them passages from the scriptures, each resonating deeply with their intentions. Among them, he took up a fan, bowed, and inscribed: \"May the nation’s fortune be preserved and endure as long as Heaven.\" This was the emperor’s own fan. Afterward, he was granted a banquet and departed.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the twelfth month, he was summoned to court. The emperor said, \"The waters of the Yu Pond have overflowed, bringing harm to the people. I have called upon you to remedy this.\" The command was issued, and he immediately inscribed an iron talisman, ordering his disciple Zhu Yongyou, along with an eunuch, to cast it into the collapsed bank of the pond. In an instant, thunder and lightning darkened the day, and a flood dragon and a giant crab were struck dead at the water’s edge.\n\nThe emperor asked, \"When you previously subdued the flood dragon, what method did you use? Can it be summoned again?\" He replied, \"The one I command is Guan Yu. He may be called forth.\" Grasping his sword, he summoned Guan Yu to the left of the hall, and Guan appeared. The emperor, startled, tossed a *Chongning* coin to him, saying, \"Use this as your seal.\" Henceforth, Guan Yu was worshipped as *Chongning Zhenjun* (True Lord of Prosperous Peace).\n\nThe following year, in the third month, he reported that the salt tax had returned to normal. In the fifth month, he was summoned, granted a seat, and asked about the similarities and differences in Daoist methods. He replied, \"The Dao is fundamentally non-action, yet nothing is left undone. Its essence is the Dao itself, and its function is the method. Essence and function share a single source—there is no inherent difference. If one does not establish unity, then two are merely forced distinctions. Where, then, is there any difference?\" The emperor said, \"Indeed, if there were differences, then speech itself would become a third thing.\"\n\nThereupon, he presented the *Heavenly Heart Methods for Dispelling Calamities*, including the Thunder Rites, which the emperor personally performed. In the seventh month, he established an altar to transmit scriptures and registers, expounding on the wonders of the Dao and its methods. Those who came to pay their respects gathered in great numbers, all departing with deep understanding.\n\nThe emperor, seated in the Hall of Celestial Auspices, casually inquired about both Daoist matters and state governance. He replied, \"The ministers of the Yuanyou era all bear the weight of the realm’s expectations. I humbly beseech Your Majesty to show them leniency.\" The emperor, startled, said, \"What is there that I would not tolerate?\" He replied, \"Your Majesty has grandly established the imperial standard, remaining impartial and without faction, ever mindful of the people under Heaven. This is most fortunate.\" He earnestly requested to return to the mountains. The emperor praised him, granted his leave, and offered gold and silk, all of which he declined. The emperor ordered his ministers to prepare a farewell banquet at the capital’s gate.\n\nIn the fourth year, he was summoned again to perform a ritual in the inner court. There, he secretly reported the omens of the \"Red Horse and Scarlet Ram\" and urged the cultivation of virtue. Emperor Huizong of Song issued an edict: \"Zhang Jixian, the thirty-first-generation descendant of the Han Celestial Master, has inherited the profound merits of his ancestor. As his descendant, you have not neglected the distant legacy, carrying on the ancestral methods. Your efficacy with talismanic water is renowned, and your virtue is serene and harmonious. Your Dao is lofty and pure. It is fitting to bestow honors to illuminate the true wind. You are granted the title *Master of Serene Repose* and presented with golden statues of Laozi and the Han Celestial Master.\"\n\nRepeatedly requesting to return, he was not permitted. The emperor asked what he desired, and he replied, \"What I desire is this: the Upper Clarity Abbey is dilapidated and remote. The community wishes to relocate and rebuild it, but our strength is insufficient.\" The emperor ordered the Jiangdong transport commissioner to survey the mountain, select a site, and oversee the relocation and reconstruction, granting fields to sustain the community. He also established a hermitage to the north of the mountain as a place for the Celestial Master’s cultivation, bestowing upon it the imperial inscription *Jingtong Hermitage*. A pavilion named *Xiuran* was built, along with three abbeys—*Lingbao*, *Yunjin*, and *Zhenyi*—while the ancestral shrine was transformed into the *Yanfa Abbey*. Jade tablets were presented, and the ancestral master’s title was elevated, with posthumous enfeoffment as a True Lord.\n\nIn the twelfth month, he returned to the mountain. All his father’s and elder brothers’ ranks were conferred with distinctions. Scholars from all directions, numbering in the thousands, flocked to him. In the *dinghai* year of the Daguan era, the emperor dispatched an envoy to command a ritual on the mountain and summoned him to court. At the time, Master Xu shared his lodgings. Soon after, Master Xu remarked, \"Worldly affairs are fleeting. Would it not be better to retire?\" He replied, \"To return is simply to return. What need is there for thought or worry?\" Master Xu suddenly sat upright and passed away.\n\nOn the fifth day of the fifth month, he was summoned to the palace. The emperor said, \"There appears to be a malevolent presence. You must dispel it.\" He replied, \"When evil is heard of, it does not disturb the upright. Malevolence cannot overcome virtue. If Your Majesty cultivates virtue, the malevolence will naturally cease.\" An attendant reported that a malevolent spirit had indeed appeared at the *Renji Pavilion*. Moments later, the spirit possessed a young man, who clutched his head, weeping and bowing. The Celestial Master said, \"Your heart has obscured itself, leading you astray. Return to your original form. You should swiftly depart.\" The young man ceased weeping, collapsed to the ground for some time, and then revived.\n\nThe emperor again commanded that dozens of large urns be filled with water from the capital region. Talismans were cast into the water, which was then given to the ailing to drink—all who drank were cured. The emperor dispatched envoys to inquire about essential Daoist teachings, adding that immortality could be learned and deathlessness attained. The Celestial Master composed the *\"Song of the Great Dao\"* and presented it to the envoys for delivery.\n\nDuring a severe drought, he was ordered to pray for rain, and rain fell for three days. He was appointed *Grand Minister of the Great Void*, but declined the title. The emperor composed a poem and bestowed it upon him. In the second year of the *Daguan* era, he returned to the mountains. Though offered gold and silk, he firmly declined, saying, \"This humble one is but a rustic in coarse cloth—what use have I for such things?\"\n\nOfficials and nobles lined the roads to see him off. He bowed in farewell, saying, \"Gathering and parting are the natural order; appearing and withdrawing have no fixed time. This floating life passes in an instant—may you all strive diligently.\" Upon returning to the mountains, he told his disciples, \"From the Jiang and Xiang rivers to Shu, there are twenty-eight *zhi* [Daoist sacred sites]. After returning from Qin Chuan to the mountains, I built a hut at the Western Source and named it *Hunlun*.\"\n\nNorth of the *Qionglin* Terrace in Yiyang, there was one who loved the Western Source and composed five *jueju* poems in praise of it. At that time, Shi Zifang arrived from Poyang, and they traveled together. One day, the Celestial Master spoke to him of the transformations between life and death.\n\nShi Zifang replied, \"I have attained wholeness through Heaven, knowing neither fondness for life nor aversion to death—how then could death claim me?\"\n\nThe Celestial Master answered, \"Not so. You speak of attaining wholeness through Heaven, but through what does Heaven itself attain wholeness? When the True Governor is obscured and the faculties of perception blaze unchecked, the solitary radiance of the One True [Dao] alone shines forth, while all else across ten thousand kalpas is void—thus even Heaven has nothing to preserve.\"\n\nShi Zifang gained insight.\n\nIn the second year of Zhenghe, envoys were again dispatched to summon him, but he declined on grounds of illness. He sent his disciple Wang Daojian to offer thanks, declaring his intent to cultivate virtue and avert calamity. Later, the *shangqing* abbey was elevated to a palace, and Daojian was appointed Grand Master of the Supreme Simplicity, charged with overseeing the Registers of the Hall of Concentrated Spirit. Commanded to perform rites to dispel the nation’s perils, he then returned to Xujiang.\n\nWang Wenqing, renowned at court for his arts alongside [the Celestial Master], also retired to the mountains. They often visited one another, passing days in carefree ease and contentment. At times, amid wind-swept dawns or moonlit evenings, they explored secluded and perilous places, wandering and chanting verses, each finding his own joy.\n\nOne day, [the Celestial Master] inscribed the wall of the *Turan* Pavilion:\n\n*\"The Crimson Emperor rides his dragon, yet his course remains unmastered;\nChang’e divides the moon to enter the depths of Mount Tan.\"*\n\nNone could fathom its meaning.\n\nOnce, while traveling to Magu, he rested at the Pavilion of Clouds Aligned and sighed, \"The steps to Penglai are now shallow—has the mulberry field grown clear?\"\n\nHis words were borne out by the calamity of Jingkang.\n\nIn the *bingwu* year, as the Jin invaded Bianjing, the Emperor and the Retired Emperor recalled the Celestial Master’s earlier memorials and urgently dispatched envoys to summon him. Arriving at the Abbey of Heavenly Felicity in Sizhou, he took up his brush and composed a hymn:\n\n*\"A single bronze mirror, its face green,\nLayered peaks of pale jade rise between.\nSuddenly, crimson locks blaze in the night—\nFootsteps shift to ask the Grotto-Heaven.\nIncense clouds gather in the jeweled hall,\nAll things at rest, none to disturb them all.\nBeneath the western hills, the sun descends red,\nMisty rain falls in silent streams overhead.\"*\n\nAs he finished writing, he departed this world.\n\nIt was the twenty-third day of the eleventh month in the *bingwu* year of Jingkang, the very day the capital fell.\n\nThe late Celestial Master’s kinsman, Martial Grandee Zhang Xian, arrived and led the local gentry and commoners in interring him beneath Tortoise Mountain.\n\nEarlier, while the Celestial Master was in the capital, the Imperial Academy student Chen Shu had asked Yi Guan about his life’s end. The Celestial Master replied: “Chen Shu shall be a loyal minister, his name enduring without decay. Yi Guan shall serve as a county magistrate and die in old age.” Later, after Emperor Gaozong crossed south, Chen Shu memorialized the throne, petitioning for the dismissal of Huang Qianshan and Wang Boyan, and was executed for it. Yi Guan, as magistrate of Taihe, lived in poverty and died at the year’s end.\n\nSixteen years after the Celestial Master’s transformation, in the *xinyou* year of Shaoxing, the Western River adept Sa Shoujian traveled to Qingcheng and encountered him at the Gorge’s mouth. There, he was bestowed talismanic methods, a *Shuidiao* song lyric, a sealed letter, and a single shoe, with instructions to deliver them to the succeeding Celestial Master. Upon reaching the mountain, the successor opened the letter and marveled at its contents. Dispatching a messenger to verify at Sizhou, they found only one shoe remaining—thus confirming his liberation through the corpse.\n\nLater sightings of him were also reported at Mount Wuyi and Luofu.\n\nEmperor Wuzong of the Yuan issued an edict, proclaiming: “We reflect that Guangchengzi, dwelling on Kongtong, discoursed on the wondrous union of form and spirit; that Tang’s Sang Chu, residing in Weilei, was honored with the rites of ancestral sacrifice. Through generations, the true wind has flourished, and it is fitting to bestow a venerable title in this illustrious age. The thirty-first successor of the Han, the Celestial Master Xu Jing, immersed himself in profound stillness, his nature pure and harmonious. The Dao gathers in emptiness, and through it he awakened to the Mystery; his conduct in the mundane was serene and steadfast. Once, in response to the Song sovereign’s leisurely inquiry, he expounded at length on the Laozi’s principle of purity and quiescence. The spirit attains numinosity through the One—thus his prayers and invocations were ever efficacious. All things return to their root in stillness, for therein abides the enduring refinement of essence and qi. Therefore, We enhance his celestial rank and confer an exalted name upon his ancestral register. Though the feathered transcendent bathes in the Yang Valley, We do not merely long for his lofty traces—riding the white clouds, he returns to his homeland, yet still upholds the mandate of his forebears.” He was thus enfeoffed as *Xu Jing, the Profoundly Penetrating and Vastly Awakened Perfected Lord*.\n\nThe thirty-second Celestial Master, named Shi Xiu with the courtesy name Chaoying, was the grandson of the twenty-seventh Celestial Master, Xiangzhong, and the son of Dunzhi. Xu Jing never married and had no children. His younger brother, Yuan Zong, became a Daoist priest and was intended to succeed the lineage, his radiance purifying the teachings. However, when Xu Jing traveled to Sizhou, he entrusted his seal, sword, scriptures, and registers to Chaoying. Thus, the assembly urged Chaoying to inherit the tradition. He demurred, saying: “To continue the legacy of my ancestors, I follow my nephew. How could I presume to succeed?” The assembly replied: “The dharma-lineage resides here.” He then assumed the succession.\n\nThus, he retired in tranquil serenity, his aspirations devoted to cultivation and refinement. At the age of sixty-one, he transcended the mortal realm.\n\nIn the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era of the Yuan dynasty, he was posthumously enfeoffed as the Orthodox Unity Vast Transformation Illuminated Awakened Perfected Lord.\n\nThe thirty-second Celestial Master, named Shouzhen with the courtesy name Zunyi, was born to Lady Wu after a gestation of nineteen months. In the tenth year of the Shaoxing era of the Song dynasty, he inherited the lineage. In the sixth year of the Qiandao era, a malevolent spirit possessed a tree in Piling, and he was summoned by imperial decree to exorcise it. As he set out, a single night’s thunder uprooted the tree. He was then summoned to court and bestowed the title Master of Orthodox Response. Emperor Gaozong received him in audience and consulted him on Daoist methods. During the reign of Emperor Xiaozong, when the Yangtze’s torrents surged and breached their banks, he was ordered to perform a jiao ritual in the inner palace. A wondrous response ensued, and the emperor bestowed upon him an ivory tablet, a treasured sword, and the two scriptures *Qingjing* (*Clarity and Stillness*) and *Yinfu* (*The Hidden Talisman*), reaffirming his title as Master of Orthodox Response. On the thirtieth day of the tenth month in the third year of the Chunxi era, he addressed his disciples, saying: “Recently, I received a letter from my elder brother, the Profoundly Penetrating Perfected Lord, proposing a rendezvous at Mount Qingcheng. Now, I must depart.” With these words, he transcended, and his remains were interred near the west side of the Yanfa Abbey.\n\nEmperor Xiaozong of the Yuan dynasty issued an edict, stating: “Exhorting the Celestial Master, thirty-second successor Shouzhen: you have transmitted the ancestral legacy, spanning generations for decades, and its traces have not yet faded—this is indeed extraordinary. Having already conferred upon you a noble title, in accordance with precedent, I now appoint you Master of Orthodox Response and posthumously enfeoff you as the Lofty, Vacuous, Radiant, and Wondrous Orthodox Response Perfected Lord.”\n\nThe thirty-third Celestial Master, named Jingyuan with the courtesy name Deying, was initially named Bojing. During the Qiandao era, he accompanied his father to court, where Emperor Gaozong took special notice of him and bestowed his present name. He once performed a jiao ritual in the inner palace, eliciting a profound response. When the imperial prince, the Prince of Wei, governed Mingzhou and fell ill, Jingyuan established an altar to petition for his recovery.\n\nUpon his arrival, he spat water for the prince to drink, and the illness was cured. The prince then sent him off with particularly generous gifts. One day, the prince again dispatched an envoy to extend an invitation. As the envoy approached the gate, Jingyuan suddenly summoned his disciples and said, “My time to ascend as an immortal cannot be delayed.” He then leaned against his desk and passed away, his sword left behind at Shangqing’s Jujia Source. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era of the Yuan dynasty, he was posthumously enfeoffed as the Lofty Perfected of True Emptiness and Primordial Dao, the Perfected Lord of Soaring Dao.\n\nThe Acting Celestial Master, named Sixian with the courtesy name Guangzu, was born in the guisi year of the Qiandao era. His elder brother Jingyuan had once treated him as a son. At nineteen, he inherited the teaching. During the Chongning era, he was summoned to court, where Prince Jingxian bestowed upon him the characters *qiaoyin* (“woodcutter-recluse”). After presiding over the teaching for eleven years, the clan elders deliberated and decided that since Jingyuan had a son, the succession should pass to him. Thus, the seal and sword were handed to his nephew Qingxian, and Sixian retired to cultivate the Dao until the end of his days.\n\nThe thirty-fourth Celestial Master, named Qingxian with the courtesy name Shaozu, was the son of Deying. Before Qingxian’s birth, Deying had raised his younger brother Sixian to temporarily oversee the teaching. Qingxian inherited the teaching in the xinyou year of the Jiatai era. His nature was compassionate and frugal, and he often aided the poor. As a result, the transmission of the scriptural registers flourished under him. He could drink several *dou* of wine without becoming drunk. Once, while traveling to Zhanggong Cave in the mountains, he came upon an extremely deep well. In jest, he tossed a leaf into it. Suddenly, waves surged, and an old man emerged from the well, bowed, and made a request before warning him not to dredge the well in times of drought and then departing. On the twenty-second day of the tenth month in the second year of the Jiading era, a Daoist arrived for an audience, treating him with great reverence. After the visitor left, Qingxian told his disciples, “He and I share a deep pact.” Seven days later, he rose at dawn, sat in meditation, and passed away. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era of the Yuan dynasty, he was posthumously enfeoffed as the Faithful, Unyielding, True, Wondrous, Radiant, and Transformative Perfected Lord.\n\nThe thirty-fifth Celestial Master, named Keda with the courtesy name Zixian, was the grandson of the second son of the thirty-second Celestial Master Shouzhen, named Boshan. Earlier, when Jingyuan had passed away, Bolin had temporarily overseen the teaching. After Qingxian’s death, his legitimate son Chengda was still young, so Keda’s father, Tianlin, temporarily managed the teaching. Emperor Ningzong summoned him and bestowed the title Master of Benevolent Stillness. Shortly afterward, Chengda died young, and Keda was named Qingxian’s successor. In the third year of the Shaoding era, after the death of Master of Benevolent Stillness, Keda, at the age of twelve, formally assumed the position of the thirty-fifth Celestial Master. At the time, the waters of Poyang Lake overflowed, destroying the homes of the people. Prefect Yuan Fu requested his aid, and Keda cast a talisman into the river. Thunder struck, killing a great white serpent, and the waters receded. Yuan Fu then composed a poem in his honor. During the Duanping era, he was repeatedly summoned to court and granted scriptures and funds. In the third year of the Jiaxi era, the tide at Qiantang surged, flooding the area up to the Gen Mountain Gate and submerging all the people’s homes. The emperor issued an edict for him to address it. He cast an iron talisman into the depths, and the tide receded. Later, during a great drought and locust plague, he was ordered to perform a jiao ritual at the Taiyi Palace. Rain fell, and the locusts choked. In the seventh month, he was summoned for an audience and granted the title Master of Mysterious Observation. He was also appointed to oversee the registers of the Three Mountains, concurrently managing affairs of the imperial Daoist institutions, and placed in charge of the Longxiang Palace. He rebuilt the Zhenyi Abbey, was granted several hundred *qing* of land, and exempted from taxes. The emperor personally inscribed the names *Zhenfeng Hall*, *Purple Tenuity Pavilion*, and *Zhenyi Abbey*. He also bestowed posthumous titles upon the ancestral masters, the Two Generals Guan and Shi, and the deities of Longjing and others. Emperor Shizu of the Yuan dynasty sent an envoy to inquire of him, and he presented the *Lingquan* scripture, foretelling that his descendants would be heeded. In the fourth month of the fourth year of the Jingding era, he handed the seal and sword to his second son, Zongyan, submitted a memorial in resignation, and passed away. The chancellor Jiang Wanli composed an inscription, and his sword was interred at the Ruiqing Abbey. Emperor Shizu of the Yuan issued an edict stating:\n\n“The Dao is the eternal principle of Heaven and Earth, and those who subtly participate in creation and bear its name are the shared treasure of past and present. Thus, We bestow special honors. The thirty-fifth successor of the Han Celestial Master, Master of Mysterious Observation Zhang Keda, bore the registers of the Three Mysteries and his fame resounded to the eight directions. Through accumulated merit and virtuous conduct, he attained the subtle and profound. His prayers for rain and the receding of tides were particularly efficacious. Formerly, when Our predecessor was still in the princely residence, he dispatched envoys in secret to the Pearl Court. Knowing that the Mandate of Heaven had a destined recipient, he silently transmitted the *Lingquan* scripture, foreseeing that sagely brilliance would unify the Four Seas—this was a sign to be heeded. Twenty years later, as the numinous and the Dao both discerned the future, the distant and the near rejoiced alike, truly fulfilling the words of old. Now, cherishing the true and the transcendent, We bestow extraordinary favor. The successor master and his younger brother, steadfastly upholding the ancestral teachings, join Master Liushun in presiding over the mysteries of the Dao. Thus, We establish the sacrifices of Jiqiu and add the title *True Unity*. Alas! The regalia of office are not the aspirations of the perfected, and the clouds and carriages of proximity still await the unfolding of what has yet to be realized.”\n\nHe was posthumously enfeoffed as the Perfected Lord of Penetrating Mystery, Responsive Transformation, and Mysterious Observation.\n\nThe thirty-sixth Celestial Master, named Zongyan with the courtesy name Shichuan and the sobriquet Jianqi, was of a profound and tranquil nature. From childhood, he was exceptionally intelligent. At nineteen, he inherited the teaching. During the Xianchun era of the Song dynasty, the prefecture of Shangrao suffered a drought. The prefect, Tang Zhen, requested his aid in praying for rain, and the response came as expected. When Emperor Shizu of the Yuan conquered the Song, he dispatched envoys with generous messages, summoning Zongyan to court. The emperor’s ministers welcomed him at the outskirts with full courtesies. Upon his audience, the emperor questioned him twice. In the sixth month, he performed a jiao ritual in the inner palace.\n\nThe following year, he performed another jiao ritual at Changchun Palace. The emperor bestowed upon him the title \"Zhenren of Dao-Pervading, Spirit-Responsive, Harmonious Emptiness\" and granted him a silver seal of the second rank, commanding him to oversee Daoist affairs in the Jiangnan region. He was authorized to issue ordination certificates for those entering the Daoist path, and to establish Daoist Registries along major routes, Daoist Rectifiers in prefectures, and Masters of Ritual Decorum in counties, all under his jurisdiction. An imperial edict exempted Daoist temples in Jiangnan from taxes and corvée labor. In the capital, Chongzhen Wanshou Palace was constructed, with his disciple Zhang Liusun appointed to preside over it.\n\nLater, he was summoned to court twice more, each time receiving even greater honors. One day, a Daoist monk visited and spoke of a \"jade hare’s covenant.\" On the eleventh day of the eleventh month in the Xinyou year of the Zhiyuan era, a white hare was presented. He said to his disciples, \"I was born at dawn yesterday; today, I depart at dawn tomorrow.\" He then wrote a hymn and transformed, his sword buried at Xietianyuan. Posthumously, he was honored as \"Zhenren of Dao-Pervading, Spirit-Responsive, Harmonious Emptiness, and Mysterious Tranquility.\"\n\nEmperor Shizu of the Yuan issued an edict:\n*\"To the Celestial Master of Longhu Mountain, Zhang:*\nYour ancestor, Dao-Ling, cultivated single-minded devotion and received the orthodox transmission of the Daoist register, its efficacy widely attested and its teachings disseminated to this day. Your lineage has endured for over thirty-six generations across more than two thousand years. Though I have long heard of your renown, the estrangement between our realms prevented me from extending an invitation. Recently, the Song ruler, failing to measure his virtue or strength, detained my envoys and refused to release them. Thus, I commanded my Left Chancellor, Bo Yan, to lead troops south. By the grace of Heaven, the Great River now lies within our domain, and North and South are united as one family. I now dispatch Generals Wang Shiying and Xiao Yu, bearing this edict to summon you. Do not harbor doubts due to the change of rule. Your ancestors, since the Eastern Han, have served fifteen dynasties with impartiality, never swayed by bias. Heaven is without partiality, and its mandate is not constant. As one who understands the Dao, how could you be confused on this point? Hasten to answer the call; do not decline excessively. Let this edict be known to you. Respect this decree.\"*\n\nEmperor Shizu of the Yuan issued a proclamation:\n*\"The thirty-sixth Celestial Master, Zhang Zongyan:*\nYou have inherited the transmission of the Dao and embodied the pure essence of its teachings. You have propagated the great rituals of the Yellow Court and Supreme Cavern, upheld the Orthodox Unity register of numinous might, purified and refined through sincerity and faith. With a three-foot green serpent, you command spirits in the unseen realms; with a ladle of bright water, you dispel calamities near and far. Having rendered great service in salvation and governance, you are fittingly granted this honorific title. Thus, you are bestowed the title 'Zhenren of Dao-Pervading, Spirit-Responsive, Harmonious Emptiness.'\"*\n\nEmperor Chengzong of the Yuan issued a proclamation:\n*\"Since ancient times, the enlightened have often dwelled in renowned mountains, their conduct guided by the times. The thirty-sixth Celestial Master, 'Zhenren of Dao-Pervading, Spirit-Responsive, Harmonious Emptiness,' oversees Daoist affairs across the Jiangnan region. Zhang Zongyan inherited the lineage of immortals, delving into the practice of tranquil concentration. When the imperial army first arrived at Ezhu, his wondrous Dao reached the ears of the Emperor. Edicts bearing vermilion seals, cloud-script, and phoenix-calligraphy descended upon Jiangnan. He was honored with golden robes, jade crowns, and a crane-drawn carriage, thrice summoned to the sacred presence. The ancestral teachings flourished anew, and the mysteries of the Dao shone brighter. Though his immortal journey is distant, we extend our compassionate rites. Thus, we elevate his title and bestow further grace. Alas! Like the Yang of Jingyang who subdued the flood dragon, his virtuous legacy endures in his descendants. May his abode be free of pestilence, and his blessings extend to the people. He is posthumously honored as 'Zhenren of Dao-Pervading, Spirit-Responsive, Harmonious Emptiness, and Mysterious Tranquility.'\"*\n\nThe thirty-seventh Celestial Master, named Yudi with the courtesy name Guohua and the sobriquet Xizi, was of a profound and silent nature. He mastered the Three Teachings and composed poetry and prose effortlessly, producing thousands of words. At twenty, he accompanied his father to court. His demeanor was refined and luminous, his responses quick and apt, drawing repeated admiration from the emperor. In the Xinyou year of the Zhiyuan era, he inherited the teaching. Upon his summons, the emperor granted him a seat and offered profound comfort, appointing him \"Zhenren of the Body-Mystery, Dao-Broadening, Teaching-Expanding\" and entrusting him with oversight of Daoist affairs in the Jiangnan region.\n\nWhen Emperor Chengzong ascended the throne, he was summoned again. He performed jiao rituals in the Round Hall and Changchun Palace, and the emperor commanded that his ritual texts be practiced throughout the realm. All Tianqing Temples across the empire were renamed Xuanmiao Temples. One day, he suddenly told his disciples, \"I have always held worldly tastes in little regard. Remaining in the capital for so long is not my wish.\" He earnestly requested to return to the mountains, but his plea was not granted. A month later, he transformed at Chongzhen Palace. His coffin was escorted back to the mountains, and court ministers held a memorial service at the capital’s gates. He was later buried at Yutian.\n\nEmperor Shizu of the Yuan issued a proclamation:\n*\"Zhang Yudi, the thirty-seventh-generation descendant of the Han Celestial Master, shall succeed his father as 'Zhenren of Dao-Pervading, Spirit-Responsive, Harmonious Emptiness,' inheriting the transmission of the Dao and propagating its mysteries. Let Zhang Yudi act accordingly.\"*\n\nEmperor Shizu of the Yuan issued another proclamation:\n*\"Zhang Yudi, the thirty-seventh-generation descendant of the Han Celestial Master:*\nYour lineage is blessed, and your transformations are boundless. We fittingly bestow the honor of a purple decree to serve as a model for the Daoist gate. Thus, you are granted the title 'Zhenren of the Body-Mystery, Dao-Broadening, Teaching-Expanding,' and entrusted with oversight of Daoist affairs in the Jiangnan region.\"*\n\nEmperor Wuzong of the Yuan issued a proclamation:\n*\"Inheriting the Daoist teachings and continuing the ancestral path, you extend your virtue within and dispense grace without, aligning with the present era’s aspirations. The thirty-seventh Celestial Master of the Han lineage, the Immortal Maiden Feng Shuzhen, traces her noble lineage to ancient times. Her virtuous bearing rivals the transmission of Gu Cheng, and her adherence to purity and tranquility surpasses the resolve of Wu Zhou. Her steadfast integrity has earned her blessings, and her exploration of the Dao has brought her renown. This convergence of dragon and tiger, phoenix and cloud is a rare fortune. Thus, we honor her with a decree befitting the dancing phoenix and returning simurgh. Inheriting the flourishing teachings, she is appointed 'Immortal Maiden of Pure Brightness and Unadorned Tranquility.'\"*\n\n---\n\nThe thirty-eighth Celestial Master, named Yu Cai, styled Guoliang, and known by the sobriquet Guangweizi, was the second son of Zongyan. Endowed with innate benevolence and magnanimity, he composed poetry and prose with effortless mastery, and his calligraphy and letters were exquisite and extraordinary. In the thirty-first year of the Zhiyuan era, he succeeded to the teachings. The emperor dispatched envoys to bestow upon him a ceremonial cap, robes, and jade pendants, commanding him to oversee the affairs of the Daoist teachings and summoning him for an audience. The following year, the era name was changed to Yuanzhen, and he was received in the Daming Hall. In the year thereafter, he was appointed by imperial decree as the \"Perfected of Supreme Simplicity, Spirit-Congealing, and Vast Dao,\" concurrently overseeing Daoist affairs. His mother was also enfeoffed as the \"Immortal Maiden of Mysterious Truth and Wondrous Response,\" empowered to issue ordination certificates to Daoist priests, exempt Daoist temples from corvée labor, protect the registers of the law, and spare them from distant transport duties.\n\nIn the second year of the Dade era, an official from Haiyan reported that the tides in two prefectures had surged, flooding a hundred *li*, with waves nearly breaching the city walls. The Celestial Master was ordered to address the crisis. Upon arriving in Hangzhou, he performed a ritual at the Yousheng Abbey, casting iron talismans into the river’s collapsed banks. Three talismans leapt forth, thunder and lightning darkened the day, and a monstrous fish-headed, turtle-bodied creature over a *zhang* in length was struck dead at the water’s edge. The embankments were restored to their former state.\n\nIn the fifth year, he was summoned again to the capital. The chancellor, Dalahan, requested prayers for rain. The Celestial Master replied, \"Sincerity can reach Heaven, and Heaven will surely respond.\" The following day, rain fell. The emperor inquired, \"The winter has been warm without snow—might the people suffer disaster?\" He commanded the Celestial Master to erect an altar and pray. That very night, snow accumulated to a depth of a *chi*. In the sixth year, he sought leave to return home. The emperor, holding court at Liulin, summoned the Celestial Master to assist in the sacrifices, bestowing lavish praise. He also sealed incense and instructed the Celestial Master to pray at renowned mountains and abbeys along his journey, performing a concluding ritual at the Shangqing Zhengyi Abbey. A silver seal was granted, ranking him as a first-grade official, and he was further honored as Grand Master for Glorious Happiness with Gold and Purple, Duke of Liu, Master of the Orthodox Unity Teachings, and concurrently overseer of the talismanic registers of the Three Mountains. Two preceding generations of hereditary masters and three generations of lineage masters were all enfeoffed as Perfected Lords. His mother, Lady Zhou, was honored as the \"Primordial Sovereign of Mysterious Truth, Wondrous Response, Profound Virtue, and Benevolent Relief.\"\n\nAt the time, the Empress Dowager resided in the Xingsheng Palace, and Prince Renzong in the Eastern Palace, both bestowing upon him exceptional favor. That year, as summer rains persisted, the chief minister, Heshan, acting as regent in the capital, dispatched Minister of Rites Wang Yue to request prayers. Three days later, the skies cleared. Upon Renzong’s ascension, the Celestial Master was again summoned to court and received in the Jiaxi Hall. The Grand Preceptor, Qu Chu, declared by imperial decree: \"I admire the Dao of the Celestial Master, whose lineage of succession is unmatched.\" He was further bestowed with a jeweled crown and golden robes.\n\nIn the second year of the fourth month, an envoy was sent to the mountain with the following edict: \"Last winter, there was no snow, and now there is no rain. The fields cannot be sown, and I am deeply pained by the people’s suffering.\" Prayers were offered at the Shangqing Abbey, and rain promptly fell, nourishing the land far and wide. Each year, those seeking ordination or reporting droughts, floods, or pestilence arrived without cease, and all were aided. He donated grain to establish charitable granaries, relieving the poor and needy. Scholars of the esoteric arts gathered daily at his gate, and each received according to their aspirations.\n\nIn the autumn of the second year of the Yanyou era, he journeyed with his disciples through mountains and caves, composing poems and painting scenes, all imbued with profound and cautionary meanings beyond mortal comprehension. On New Year’s Eve, he painted a self-portrait with an inscription, including the line, \"An eastern wind blows snow.\" The following year, on the first day of the first month, he composed a final ode and passed away. He was interred at Mingyang in Jinxī, and a shrine was erected, named the Xuandu Abbey.\n\nIn the second year of the Yuanzhen era, Emperor Chengzong issued the following decree: \"The thirty-eighth Celestial Master, Zhang Yucai, whose virtue shines like rainbow irises and golden stalks, ranks among the finest of his generation. His learning delves into the subtleties of the myriad realms, and his teachings illuminate the orthodox doctrines of the Three Origins. His ancestors and father have already been honored with titles, and he, peerless in brotherly virtue, fittingly perpetuates the true wind. We bestow special favor to express our esteem. As one who embodies the Dao and achieves merit, you shall invigorate the lineage of the sacred mountain, revering virtue to pray for Heaven’s eternal mandate. We now exalt the rituals of the imperial chambers, granting you the title 'Perfected of Supreme Simplicity, Spirit-Congealing, and Vast Dao,' overseeing Daoist affairs in the various circuits of Jiangnan.\"\n\nIn the eighth year of the Dade era, Emperor Chengzong issued another decree: \"Since ancient times, those who could eliminate harm for the state have been revered. The first patriarch of the Orthodox Unity tradition, in Shu, once subdued the serpent-dragon well’s malevolence, while the Master of Wondrous Observation, in Hangzhou, quelled the tide’s calamity. You, wielding the seal of the law for three years, have tamed the tides eroding the two prefectures of Haiguan. Through the power of iron talismans and cinnabar registers, the fish-headed, turtle-bodied horde was vanquished, the embankments restored, and the people spared from inundation. The provincial administration of Jiangzhe reported your deeds. Considering the counsel of the Orthodox Unity’s lineage master, your sincerity has moved Heaven, and your purity and non-action merit exaltation in the immortal ranks. We hereby appoint you Master of the Orthodox Unity Teachings, concurrently overseeing the talismanic registers of the Three Mountains, with all other titles remaining unchanged.\"\n\nIn the first year of the Zhida era, Emperor Chengzong issued yet another decree: \"To expel evil and uphold righteousness is of paramount importance to the world’s teachings. To honor virtue and reward merit is a fundamental principle of governance. Our sagely ancestors long revered the supreme Dao, and our late emperor repeatedly honored the true rites. Now, at the dawn of your succession, how could we delay in bestowing due honor? The Master of the Orthodox Unity Teachings, the thirty-eighth Celestial Master of the Han lineage, the Perfected of Supreme Simplicity, Spirit-Congealing, and Vast Dao, overseer of Daoist affairs in the various circuits of Jiangnan, and master of the talismanic registers of the Three Mountains, Zhang Yucai—your noble bearing and vast learning encompass all arts. Your profound exploration of principle flows like a deep spring, and your responsiveness is as effortless as a ring’s rotation. Governing the people, your efficacy is immediate; wielding the talismans, your reverence is unparalleled. When prayers for blessings are offered, they are swiftly answered; when admonitions are given, they embody perfect harmony. Your solemnity is beyond description, and your labors transcend the capacity of mere titles. Thus, we specially issue this decree to bestow further honor. Alas! The lofty traditions of the fiery Han are perpetuated by Heaven’s decree, and the great fortune of the Yuan dynasty is eternally secured. May you, in peace and prosperity, ever correspond to the vast mandate. We posthumously confer upon you the title 'Perfected of Supreme Simplicity, Spirit-Congealing, Vast Dao, and Illustrious Virtue,' Master of the Orthodox Unity Teachings, thirty-eighth Celestial Master of the Han lineage, overseeing Daoist affairs in the various circuits of Jiangnan.\"\n\nWe hereby specially appoint him as Grand Master for Splendid Happiness with Gold and Purple Insignia, enfeoff him as Duke of Liu State, with all other honors remaining as before.\n\nIn the second year of the Yuzhen era, Emperor Chengzong decreed: The application of the Supreme Dao resides in humanity. The great source of steadfastness has its origin, and the learning of the noble person reaches completion—his virtue flourishes therein. In emulation of this principle, the Perfected of Supreme Simplicity, Spirit-Congealing, Vast Dao, and Illustrious Virtue, the thirty-eighth Celestial Master of the Han lineage, Zhang Yucai, and his mother, Lady Zhou, embodied harmonious virtue and gentle conduct, their pure and simple nature rooted in the ancestral chart. Their lineage, linked to the immortal ranks, bloomed like pearl trees in shared fragrance; brothers succeeded one another in transmitting the ancestral teachings. Such excellence is esteemed in the present as it was unheard of in the past. We specially bestow this profound favor to console the utmost filial devotion, that future descendants may further enhance the radiance of the Orthodox Unity Teachings, and that for generations to come, they may eternally tend the morning and evening incense. We confer upon her the title \"Mysterious Perfection and Wondrous Response, Immortal Lady.\"\n\nIn the first year of the Zhida era, Emperor Wuzong decreed: We reflect that Laozi’s *Dao and Virtue* is rooted in the principles of filial piety and compassion. The Western Mother stands among the immortals, and the register of transcendents may be attained. The lineage of benevolence and longevity shall henceforth foster customs to honor parents. Thus, We specially exalt this model and bestow favor upon the mother of the Master of the Orthodox Unity Teachings, the thirty-eighth Celestial Master of the Han lineage, the Perfected of Supreme Simplicity, Spirit-Congealing, and Vast Dao, Zhang Yucai—Mysterious Perfection and Wondrous Response, Immortal Lady Zhou Huigong. She conducted herself with steadfast purity, her nature gentle and refined. Her virtue matched the lofty house, upholding the teachings of righteousness; her blessings enriched her descendants, furthering the transmission of the Dao’s records. It is fitting that We confer upon her the five-flowered decree of Heaven, to repay the spring radiance of a humble blade of grass.\n\nHow often has the water of Penglai been seen shallow and clear? The lotuses of the Western Pond bloom, and she dwells on Mount Gushen. She ensures that creatures suffer no pestilence and that the harvests ripen, aiding the flourishing of the Orthodox Teachings. May she enjoy long life. We appoint her as \"Mysterious Perfection and Wondrous Response, Profound Virtue, Perfected.\"\n\nIn the first year of the Yanyou era, Emperor Renzong decreed: Those who cultivate the Dao hold their mothers foremost; those who study immortality regard filial piety as paramount. Tracing the source of her virtue, We renew the bestowal of grace. The Master of the Orthodox Unity Teachings, the Perfected of Supreme Simplicity, Spirit-Congealing, Vast Dao, and Illustrious Virtue, overseeing Daoist affairs in the various circuits of Jiangnan, the thirty-eighth Celestial Master of the Han lineage, Zhang Yucai, and his mother, Mysterious Perfection and Wondrous Response, Profound Virtue, Perfected Lady Zhou Huide—her virtue and merit were profound. Serene and pure, she became a paragon of transcendence, and in her later years, a teacher of gods and humans. Fortunate indeed is the son who points to Penglai and departs, leaving behind the imperial edicts like discarded scrolls. Though the subtle and formless defy forced description, the state must duly honor her. We bestow a noble title to exalt the profound lineage. Alas! The sword is hidden by the altar, yet we still recall the mother of Wei who achieved the elixir; the thatched hut is raised for tranquility, and the mother’s aspiration transmits the Dao of Master Chen. We extend this favor to you, that you may roam freely. Thus, We posthumously enfeoff her as \"Mysterious Perfection and Wondrous Response, Profound Virtue, Compassionate and Salvific Primordial Lady.\"\n\nThe thirty-ninth Celestial Master, named Sicheng, styled Ciwang, and known as Master Tai Xuan, possessed a spirit clear and lofty, a demeanor resolute and reticent. In the third year of the Zhida era, he accompanied his father to the imperial audience. Arriving in Hangzhou, they lodged at Zongyang Palace.\n\nSuddenly, a fire broke out in Hangzhou City. The masses came seeking aid. The Celestial Master opened the Tongjiang Bridge, gazed toward the rising flames, and sprinkled water toward them—whereupon the fire was extinguished.\n\nIn the third year of the Yanyou era (1316), his father, the National Immortal, passed away. The seal and sword were conferred upon him, commanding him to inherit the teaching. He established a prefectural office at Zhang Zong, and his reputation reached the imperial court. Emperor Renzong dispatched envoys to the mountain, ordering him to preside over the Daoist affairs and summoning him to court. In the tenth month, he entered the audience hall. The Emperor questioned him at length and, pleased, exclaimed, “He is the very image of his father!” He commanded the performance of the Golden Register Grand Offering at Changchun Palace. Upon the ritual’s completion, he bestowed ceremonial robes and crowns. The following year, in the first month, the Celestial Master requested to return home. By imperial decree, he was appointed *Great Perfected of Grand Transformation, Embodied Benevolence, and Responsive Dao, Supreme Realized One of Tai Xuan*, charged with overseeing the talismanic registers of the Three Mountains and governing the Daoist affairs of Jiangnan. In recognition of his merit, his mother, née Yi, was enfeoffed as *Mysterious Radiance, Wisdom-Responsive, Eternally Tranquil Realized One*. An imperial edict was issued, commanding him to preside over the Daoist teachings, granting ordination certificates, authorizing the performance of ritual registers, and exempting him from distant corvée labor. Envoys were dispatched to escort him back to his mountain.\n\nIn the seventh year (1320), the sea tide surged again at Yanguan Prefecture. The Emperor ordered the Celestial Master to conduct a Grand Offering at the provincial headquarters. He cast an iron talisman into the crumbling riverbank, whereupon thunder and lightning erupted, and the waters receded to their former state.\n\nWhen Emperor Yingzong ascended the throne, he summoned the Celestial Master to an audience at Shangdu. An imperial edict was issued, and an escort provided for his return. In the second year of the Taiding era (1325), on the *renwu* day of the first month, a solar eclipse occurred. A high minister sought his prayers to invoke snow as an omen to avert disaster—whereupon the heavens unleashed a great snowfall. He was again commanded to perform the Yellow Register Grand Offering at Changchun Palace. At that time, auspicious omens of celestial flowers, clouds, and cranes appeared. Yu Ji, the Supervisor of the Directorate of Education, recorded the event by imperial command. The Celestial Master was further honored with the title *Orthodox Teaching Master of the Correct One, Grandly Virtuous, Supreme Perfected of Tai Xuan’s Grand Transformation, Embodied Benevolence, and Responsive Dao, Director of the Directorate of Education and Daoist Affairs*.\n\nIn the fourth year (1327), the tide at Yanguan Prefecture once more overflowed, causing the embankment to collapse and threaten the city. The Emperor summoned him to the provincial headquarters, where he performed an offering at Yousheng Palace. A three-legged tortoise appeared upon the palace hall, and the tide receded. The people of Hangzhou reported a drought, and rain immediately fell.\n\nIn the first year of the Zhishun era (1330), he entered court, where an imperial edict reaffirmed his protective authority. In the *Zhiyuan* era, he was again summoned to an audience with the Emperor at Mingren Hall. At that time, the capital region suffered from drought, and he was ordered to pray for rain at Chongzhen Palace—whereupon a great response occurred. In autumn, excessive rains fell, and his prayers brought clear skies. In winter, when no snow came, his supplications were immediately answered. The Emperor, greatly pleased, bestowed fine wine upon him and said to his ministers, “We have troubled the Celestial Master many times. Let the records of his past and present meritorious deeds be compiled in full for the imperial decree.”\n\nIn the third year (1337), in the third month, an edict was issued appointing him Director of the Directorate of Education. Having remained in the capital for some time, he requested to return to his mountain. The Emperor ordered the hundred officials to host a farewell banquet in his honor. Upon his return, he withdrew from worldly affairs, roaming freely in leisure.\n\nIn the fourth year of the Zhizheng era (1344), on the *jiashen* day, he prepared to journey to the Five Sacred Peaks and Mount Qingcheng, beginning with Mount Tai. In the ninth month, as his boat passed Lüliang, at dusk, an old man sought an audience and spoke to him in secret before departing after the passage of a brief moment. The next day, he abruptly ordered the boat to turn back. On the *gengzi* day, he arrived at Bao, where he transformed and passed away aboard the vessel. His disciples carried his crown and sword back, entering Poyang Lake and reaching Yun Jin Stream. Two black dragons guarded the boat, speeding it swiftly along. In less than six days, it reached its destination, borne by the current—such were his divine and wondrous signs. Later, he was interred on South Mountain.\n\n**Imperial Decree of Emperor Renzong of the Yuan:**\nWhen the realm possesses the Dao, it is fitting to honor the winds of purity and tranquility. When the Perfected One embodies non-action, he aids in the governance of grand peace. We proclaim and exalt his title, illuminating the lineage of the ancestral teaching. The Celestial Master Zhang Sicheng has attained the true essence of the Old Master’s teachings and stands as a pillar of the Mysterious Gate. From the Han dynasty onward, his lineage has endured for over a thousand years. Since crossing the Yangtze, four generations have passed. The thirty-ninth generation has mastered the profound teachings of the Jade Registers, inheriting the illustrious legacy of the Crimson Talismans. As recorded in the annals, when he first came to court, he conducted himself with utmost reverence, restoring the former ranks of the Immortal Officials while consolidating the new affairs of the teaching. He assisted in the establishment of the August Ultimate and expanded the imperial favor bestowed upon the grand enterprise—his fame is not undeserved. We specially bestow this grace to soothe and commend him, following the virtuous path of his ancestors. Let him ponder how to repay this favor, ever mindful of Our profound generosity, and never falter in his reverence. In recognition of his merit, his mother, née Yi, is enfeoffed as *Mysterious Radiance, Wisdom-Responsive, Eternally Tranquil Realized One*. A separate imperial edict is issued, commanding him to preside over the Daoist teachings.\n\n**Imperial Decree of Emperor Yingzong of the Yuan:**\nWe revere the Mandate of Heaven and admire the virtue of the Dao, seeking the means to pacify the people through stillness and unity. We honor the words of the Perfected One, extending glory to his descendants. The Celestial Master Zhang Sicheng, inheriting the teachings of the Old Master from his ancestors, upholds harmony, reveres correctness, and sustains the worldly teachings. His family’s legacy has been illustrious, and now it shines forth in him. His character is vast and far-reaching, his learning broad and profound. Since the previous reign, he has been deemed worthy to inherit the title, steadfastly continuing the virtuous path of his predecessors without cease. His humility and reticence have only enhanced his reputation. At the beginning of Our reign, he presented tribute and came to court, conducting himself with utmost reverence. We deem him worthy of esteem and renew Our command, reaffirming his former office. Let him unite his heart and mind to propagate his teachings, ever reverent and solemn, assisting in the governance of non-action. Let him never neglect his duties, ever mindful of his devotion. He is hereby appointed *Orthodox Teaching Master of the Correct One, Supreme Perfected of Tai Xuan’s Grand Transformation, Embodied Benevolence, and Responsive Dao, Celestial Master of the Han Succession, Director of the Directorate of Education and Daoist Affairs, Overseer of the Talismanic Registers of the Three Mountains, and Governor of the Daoist Affairs of Jiangnan*.\n\n**Imperial Decree of Prince Jin of the Yuan:**\nOur dynasty’s veneration of the Mysterious Teaching is unparalleled in antiquity. Your family’s reception of imperial favor has reached its zenith in this era. It is fitting to exalt your title and display Our esteem. The Celestial Master Zhang Sicheng is as pure as ice and snow, a divine person in this sagely age. Your ancestors and father accumulated merit and virtue in the past, while you and your descendants continue the legacy, adding luster to it. At the beginning of Our reign, you aided Us in revering virtue anew, conducting yourself with utmost care—truly reverent and courteous. The grand Dao is majestic, and together We aspire to purity and non-action. He is hereby appointed *Orthodox Teaching Master of the Correct One, Grandly Virtuous, Supreme Perfected of Tai Xuan’s Grand Transformation, Embodied Benevolence, and Vast Dao, Celestial Master of the Han Succession, Overseer of the Talismanic Registers of the Three Mountains, and Governor of the Daoist Affairs of Jiangnan*.\n\nThe Lady Hu is enfeoffed as *Illuminated Wisdom, Compassionate and Compliant Immortal Maiden*.\n\nEdict of Emperor Shun of the Yuan:\nWhen the Old Master transmitted his teachings beyond the Pass of Han’gu, he never forgot the world; when the Marquis of Liu followed Master Red Pine, did he truly abandon the realm of mortals? Thus was opened the gate of the divine teachings of the sages, and thus was entrusted the duty of the Son of Heaven to pray for blessings on behalf of the people. Those who transmit the Dharma through the ages have rendered service in every generation.\n\nNow, having come from afar to attend court, she is fittingly granted a renewed mandate. The *Orthodox Teaching Master of the Correct One, Grandly Virtuous, Supreme Perfected of Tai Xuan’s Grand Transformation, Embodied Benevolence, Responsive to the Dao, Grand Perfected of the Han Succession, Thirty-Ninth Celestial Master*, who oversees the talismanic registers of the Three Mountains and governs the Daoist affairs of Jiangnan, and who serves as Director of the Academy of Scholarly Worthies—Zhang Sizong—is a scion of divine luminosity and a pillar of virtue and the Dao. From the time his ancestors encountered Emperor Shizong and his father served Emperor Ren, they have received the celestial favor and been chosen in the imperial heart. Though he holds the leadership of the Dao-endowed, he is truly bound to the sagely and enlightened ruler, delighting in governance through non-action and broadly propagating the winds of purity and quiescence.\n\nHis radiant virtue spread far and wide, and his numinous responses shone repeatedly. As you have faithfully succeeded your predecessors, so too have We been greatly aided by your forebears. In times past, when the seas rose in disaster, you twice delivered the common folk from drowning; more recently, when the heavens turned unruly, you thrice summoned rain and snow through your spiritual communion. Such merit, though never claimed, demands due recompense.\n\nAlas! The immortals take loyalty and filial piety as their foundation, and even they do not shrink from passing their legacy to the worthy. Emperors regard heaven and earth as their heart—how could they dare forget reverence for virtue? Your official titles and positions remain unchanged.\n\nThe Fortieth Celestial Master, named Side, styled Taiyi, was the second son of Yucai. Of generous and magnanimous nature, he excelled in literature and delighted in poetry. In the jiashen year of the Zhizheng era, he succeeded to the teaching. Nine years later, in the renchen year, as war engulfed the realm, he commanded his disciple Shu Weiyin to raise righteous troops for defense. Wherever his influence reached, neighboring prefectures remained unmolested, and the people lived in peace. That October, he fell mildly ill and passed away. The following year, an imperial decree posthumously bestowed upon him the title *Taiyi Mingjiao Guangxuan Tidao Da Zhenren*, Master of the Three Mountains’ Talismanic Registers and Overseer of Daoist Affairs in Jiangnan. The decree arrived after his death, and his remains were interred at Paisha Stone.\n\nEmperor Shundi of the Yuan issued an edict: \"The Perfected of the Orthodox Unity tradition have faithfully transmitted the secret talismans, registers, and sacred writs. Descended from a lineage of divine luminosity, they are fitting recipients of the cap, robes, sword, and seal. Their immortal records bear witness, and thus We bestow this honor anew. We address you, Zhang Side: your learning draws from your family’s teachings, and your Dao expands the ancestral covenant. Your forebears’ fragrance endures, and your descendants inherit their blessings. From the time your lineage first ascended in Shu and Han, your family has spread its transformative teachings across rivers and lakes. Precious registers and golden talismans once manifested their auspicious responses in ancient records; the Azure Serpent and Jade Sword trace their origins to the legacy of your robes and furs. Your efficacy in warding off misfortune has repeatedly aided the governance of peace. Though your titles were established in former dynasties, the grace of Our court remains abundant. Purple edicts and silver seals reflect the solemnity of Our praise; pearl crowns and golden robes illuminate the purity of your lineage. Now, with the Orthodox Unity tradition lacking its heir, the disciples unanimously acclaim the rightful successor. May you uphold the autumnal rites of the True Origin, solemnize the sacred altars of the Most High, and reverently contemplate the grandeur of your inherited mission. Strive further to succor all living beings, once more exalt the numinous and plain, and forever propagate the true winds of the Dao.\n\nAh! With jade tablets and lavish gifts, ever bear in mind your duty to serve the throne with sincerity. At the altar’s edge, with secret invocations, strictly guard the blessings that shield the people. Hold fast to Our embrace and thereby magnify your teaching.\"\n\nThe Forty-First Celestial Master, named Zhengyan, styled Shuhua, was the eldest son of Side. His countenance bore an ancient dignity, and his spirit was serene; he spoke little and was deeply composed. At the time, the road to the capital had been blocked for over two years. The Jiang-Zhe Branch Secretariat dispatched envoys to confer upon him the title *Tianshi Mingcheng Ningdao Hongwen Hudao Da Zhenren*, Master of the Three Mountains’ Talismanic Registers and Overseer of Daoist Affairs in Jiangnan. In his later years, he gathered his disciples and said: \"Our family has, for generations, taken the welfare of the state, loyalty to the sovereign, and the transformation of the people as our foundation. Now, as war rages across the land and the court grows distant, the fate of the realm remains uncertain. Among you, disciples who have united the Orthodox Unity teachings in the north have received exceptional favor—can you not offer a single word to bring forth an auspicious sign?\" Thereupon, his junior disciple Cheng Tianyi was dispatched to address the Grand Master of the Orthodox Unity tradition, who, upon entering the capital, presented a memorial to the throne. The emperor declared: \"The Celestial Master is a transcendent scholar. Formerly, with the roads to Shu obstructed, We had no means to extend Our soothing governance—this has long weighed upon Us. Now, by heaven’s mandate, this fortunate opportunity arises, and We entrust the Grand Master with this mission.\" Tianyi was sent back with the decree. In the jihai year, on the Middle Prime Festival, Zhengyan ascended the dais to expound the Dao. His words, though seemingly portentous, were scarcely understood by those present. Soon after, he fell mildly ill and summoned his disciples, saying: \"Since inheriting this teaching, I have endured many hardships. Now, my time of departure has come.\" Two days later, he wrote a hymn and passed away.\n\nThe Forty-Second Celestial Master, named Zhengchang, courtesy name Zhongji, styled Chongxuzi, was the eldest son of the Thirty-Ninth Celestial Master, Taixuan. His birth was marked by an auspicious sign: Taixuan, in a light slumber, dreamed of a divine being descending from the sky, who said, \"I come from Huagai Mountain and have wandered to your home. I wish to be received here.\" Upon waking, Zhengchang was born. As a child, he was exceptionally bright, of a particularly generous and magnanimous nature, and his eyes shone with an illuminating gaze. He was fond of the words of Laozi and Zhuangzi and devoted himself especially to the secret methods of the Daoist immortals. When Taixuan journeyed to the Five Peaks, he pointed to the transmitted seal and sword, saying: \"When the Dragon Star once more gathers in the *hai* position, my son shall wield these to greatly revive the winds of the Dao.\" In the jihai year of the Zhizheng era, Zhengchang succeeded to the teaching, fulfilling Taixuan’s prophecy.\n\nAmid the chaos of war, the scriptures and registers had long been hidden, but now seekers flocked from all directions. He performed the Three Primals Offerings at the altar of the Mysterious, and whenever he refined and delivered the suffering souls, extraordinary responses invariably occurred. In the xinchou year, the founding emperor of the Great Ming, Taizu, issued an imperial proclamation commanding officials to seek and invite him. The Celestial Master then set out on his journey. He dispatched envoys to ascend the plank roads, presenting omens of heaven’s ordained succession. The emperor responded with a handwritten letter, exhorting him to \"calm the heart and stabilize the nature, thereby consolidating the merit of the Dao.\" In the yisi year, he arrived at the capital. The emperor, upon receiving him, was pleased and said: \"Your eyes flash like lightning, and your demeanor is majestic—truly a descendant of the Han Celestial Masters!\" He commanded Zhengchang to be seated and hosted a banquet in his honor, later issuing an edict to praise him. He was summoned to a second audience and banquet, where he was presented with gold and silk before returning to his mountain.\n\nIn the bingwu year, he again journeyed to the capital. The gentry and commoners seeking talismans numbered in the thousands daily, overwhelming his attendants. He closed his gates to refuse them, but the requests did not cease. The emperor instructed him to distribute talismanic water. Thereupon, he inscribed a massive talisman and cast it into the well of Chaotian Palace. The people rushed to draw the water, and in an instant, the well ran dry, revealing the earth beneath. Yet they continued to dig, and those afflicted with epidemics who drank the water were all cured. The emperor, hearing of this, commended him and ordered a pavilion built over the well, naming it Taiyi Spring. He commanded the transmission of the *Taishang Yanxi* and other ritual registers. When Zhengchang sought to return to his mountain, the emperor again dispatched eunuchs to present him with brocade robes woven with gold patterns. He was also granted a travel pass by the Secretariat, facilitating his future audiences at court.\n\nIn the first year of Hongwu, *dingwei* (1367), he journeyed to the capital to urge the emperor’s ascension to the throne. In the eleventh year of Hongwu, *wushen* (1368), the emperor ascended the great treasure throne, establishing the dynastic title and changing the reign era. Zhengchang entered the palace to offer congratulations and was granted an imperial banquet in the side hall. The emperor declared: “Hereby I bestow upon you the title of Grand Perfected One. A decree shall be issued to discuss your stipend.” Zhengchang respectfully declined the stipend in person, requesting only the continuation of former privileges—exemption from corvée and taxes—and the sole authority to issue talismans and registers. The emperor approved and commended him, granting tax exemptions for his entire household and assigning laborers of all kinds to the Great Shangqing Palace.\n\nAfter the banquet, an imperial edict was issued, its text recorded in the *Veritable Records of Imperial Ming Grace*: “We appoint the Master of Orthodox Unity, forty-second-generation Celestial Master of the Han succession, Grand Perfected One of National Protection, Ancestral Propagation, Sincere Devotion, and Vast Virtue, to oversee Daoist affairs, with a silver seal commensurate to the rank of principal second grade.” Special assistants were appointed to the Mystic Canopy, including Officiants of Doctrine and Scribes of the Registers. After receiving his leave, he departed.\n\nThe emperor, seated in the Hall of Reverent Self, remarked to him in leisure: “Your ancestor, the Celestial Master, rendered great service to the state. Thus, your family has been transmitted alongside Confucius down to the present day. You should embody this legacy with purity and non-action, aiding me in perfect governance, and I shall reward you accordingly.” He then presented fifteen *yi* of silver to renovate his residence.\n\nIn the second month of *jiyou* (1369), he was specially summoned to court. The emperor received him in the Hall of Heavenly Favors and, anticipating his arrival, had a banquet prepared. That month, he was granted four imperial audiences and two banquets. On the thirteenth day of the third month, the emperor prepared to offer sincere devotion to the Heavenly Emperor. After three days of purification rites, the emperor donned his ceremonial robe and cap, personally inscribing his name on the memorial. He ordered the Court of Imperial Sacrifices to prepare music and handed the document to the Perfected One, who was to pray and burn it. Upon the completion of the rites, the emperor bestowed gold and silk, hosted a banquet in the Literary Pavilion, and provided a separate feast for his disciples in another hall, with rewards distributed accordingly.\n\nIn the summer of *gengxu* (1370), the emperor, recognizing his merits and favor, specially instructed the Ministry of Rites to posthumously confer upon his father, the thirty-ninth-generation Celestial Master, the title Grand Perfected One of Great Mystery, Assisting Transformation, Embodied Benevolence, and Responsive Dao. His successor was named Grand Perfected One of Orthodox Unity, Great Mystery, Vast Transformation, Illuminated Accomplishment, and Venerable Dao. His mother, the Illuminated Wisdom Compassionate and Compliant Immortal Lady Hu, was re-titled the Reverent, Compliant, Kind, and Tranquil Mystic Lady.\n\nThat autumn, the emperor summoned him again and inquired about the nature of spirits and gods, further granting him a silver seal to oversee all Daoist affairs under heaven. In the autumn of *renzi* (1372), he was specially summoned to court and honored with an additional decree to permanently oversee all Daoist affairs.\n\nIn the autumn of *bingshen* (1376), the emperor dispatched an envoy to summon him. Unexpectedly, he arrived ahead of schedule. Upon his audience, the emperor rejoiced: “Why does your arrival so perfectly accord with my intentions? Next autumn, I shall send envoys to offer sacrifices to the gods of the seas and mountains. You should select your most diligently cultivated disciples to accompany them.” He was granted a banquet, a golden ritual robe, a jade tablet, and ritual implements.\n\nIn the summer of *dingsi* (1377), he led his disciples to court. A banquet was held atop the Meridian Gate’s city tower, where the emperor raised his cup and said: “You should drain this goblet.” He then ordered the eunuchs to present an imperial composition—a eulogy for the Celestial Masters of past dynasties—saying: “One day, I shall inscribe this and bestow it upon you.” The next day, he was dispatched to offer sacrifices at Mount Song, while high officials and disciples were sent to perform rites at the Five Peaks. Each was granted two sets of robes and varying amounts of paper money. Upon his return, he was rewarded with a banquet as before.\n\nUpon returning to his mountain, his aspirations grew unusual. One day, he prepared wine and drank heartily with his brothers. Sighing deeply, he said: “The Five Peaks and famous mountains—my late father longed to visit them but never did. The Central Peak of Mount Song is where our ancestor received the *Taiqing Alchemical Canon*. Now, by the sacred virtue of the Son of Heaven, I have been fortunate enough to arrive here. I shall gaze upon the rosy dawn in the layered clouds and let the vast kalpas drift like floating dust—my resolve is set.” All marveled at his words.\n\nSoon after, he fell ill. Seated upright on his bed, he instructed his disciple Fang Congyi: “I have no way to repay the imperial favor. You must assist my descendants in promoting the mandate of peaceful governance.” He took his seal and sword and handed them to his son, saying: “Our family’s fifteen-hundred-year transmission rests upon this. You must strive diligently.” With these words, he raised his hand in a circular gesture and passed away in silence.\n\nThat night, a great cliff collapsed, its sound echoing for tens of miles. Minister of Rites Zhang Chou reported the news. The emperor sighed in grief for a long while, then said: “I intended to command him to oversee sacrifices at the Five Peaks. Now, he has only just reached Mount Song—how could his allotted span end here?” He personally composed a eulogy and dispatched An Qing, former Vice Minister of the Zhejiang Branch Secretariat, to offer condolences and sacrifices. His remains were interred at the mouth of Cikeng Ravine on South Mountain.\n\nThe forty-third-generation Celestial Master, named Yu Chu, styled Zixuan, with the sobriquet Qishan, was the eldest son of Chongxu. His eyes were strikingly bright, with two pupils resembling twin stars.\n\nAt the age of nine, he bore the gravity of a seasoned elder. One day, a remarkable figure sought an audience, declaring: “This is a scholar among the immortal ranks—one who shall one day greatly expand this teaching.” As he matured, his intellect and insight soared, his learning profound. He mastered the Three Teachings, fusing them into a single path, and delved into the works of the Hundred Schools, exhaustively exploring their depths. His writings, whether conveying the Dao or recording events, achieved exquisite refinement. He compiled the *Jianquan Literary Collection* in twenty scrolls, which so impressed the Prince of Liao that he had it printed. When the work reached the emperor’s hands, he was summoned to court and showered with favor. Even the nobility and gentry held him in the highest esteem.\n\nOnce, while attending Chongxu at the Heavenly Heart Moon-on-Water Pavilion, he witnessed clouds rising in the northwest, parting to reveal a golden gate flung open amid a radiant glow of five colors. Celestial guards stood in solemn array, their mirrored armor gleaming. Startled, he changed countenance. Chongxu questioned him, and he recounted all he had seen. From then on, Chongxu entrusted him with the family’s secret *Yijing* teachings. When tested, his divinations grew ever more uncanny.\n\nIn the eleventh year of Hongwu, he was summoned to court. The emperor examined him closely, then smiled and said, “He is the very image of his father.” His favor deepened. The following year, the emperor dispatched an envoy to the mountain, bestowing a precious edict and exhorting the Two Ways. He was invested as the Orthodox Unity Successor of the Dao, Grand Realized One of the Unbounded Clarity and Ancestral Radiance, and charged with propagating the teachings. Another imperial handwritten edict urged him to cultivate his integrity further to align with the will of the gods. He was granted ritual robes, gold, and silk, along with travel warrants to return to the mountain.\n\nIn the year *xinyou*, an edict was issued, ennobling his mother, Lady Bao, as the Mysterious and Virtuous Lady of Pure Emptiness. In *guihai*, he was summoned to the capital and commanded to conduct the *Jade Register* Grand Offering on Purple Gold Mountain. In *yichou*, he was ordered to pray for rain at the Divine Music Abbey, and the prayers were swiftly answered. In *gengwu*, he was received in audience and approved the reconstruction of the Great Supreme Clarity Palace. On the first day of the sixth month in *xinyou*, the emperor held court and decreed through the Ministry of Rites that counterfeit talismans be strictly prohibited. He bestowed the Seal of the Orthodox Unity Mystic Altar to authenticate talismans and perpetually guard the sacred mountains.\n\nUpon his return, he selected a site beneath Huangzhu Peak in his hometown and built the Jianquan Retreat as his final abode. In *renwu*, when Emperor Chengzu ascended the throne, he journeyed to offer congratulations and was met with even greater favor. The emperor bestowed fine silk and funds for the restoration of the Great Supreme Clarity Palace. In the first year of Yongle, he was commanded to assist in the sacrifices at the Altar of Heaven. In\n\nOn the third day of the fifth month, he petitioned the throne to return to the mountains in his old age.\n\nOne day, after gathering his followers for a feast on the Mid-Autumn Festival, he composed a hymn:\n*\"Delving into the Zhou’s* Yijing *cavern, I sought the floating Mount Feng of Qiu;\nBy the Rainbow Bridge of Qian, at the Thunder Ford of Kun—\nAh! Half the world’s pure radiance is autumn’s glow,\nThe other half, the steadfast qi returns to heaven’s expanse.\"*\n\nSuddenly, a great thunderclap resounded, and his late wife, Madame Sun, was posthumously honored as the \"Serene, Chaste, Wondrously Wise, and Mystic Sovereign.\" The court bestowed gold, silk, coins, and exotic gifts of foreign fruits and sea delicacies.\n\nIn *gengzi*, the emperor summoned him to court and commanded him to lead the Daoist priests in performing the grand *Yulu* purification rite, yielding abundant auspicious signs. In the tenth month, he was ordered to conduct the *Pudu* deliverance ritual at the Lingji Palace in the capital.\n\nOn the first day of the new year in *xinchou*, he was appointed to offer secondary sacrifices at the Altar of the Stars and later to perform the *Bao’an* ritual for safeguarding peace. On the seventh day, he was granted ceremonial robes, jade pendants, brocade, fine silks, sable furs, and other regalia.\n\nUpon the emperor’s return to the capital after his northern campaign, he commanded the performance of a grand thanksgiving rite. In response to the auspicious omens of luminous clouds and propitious mists, the emperor bestowed even greater rewards and issued a special decree of commendation. In *jiachen*, he was ordered to conduct rituals at Mount Taihe.\n\nWhen Emperor Renzong the Illustrious ascended the throne, he journeyed to offer congratulations and was commanded to perform the *Jianyang* grand purification rite, which also yielded extraordinary signs. The emperor issued further decrees of praise and bestowed a jade-and-gold ritual seal, a golden-embroidered robe, a crane-feather cloak, sable furs, jade pendants, fine silks, and graded rewards for his accompanying disciples.\n\nWhen Emperor Xuanzong the Eminent ascended the throne and proclaimed the *Xuande* era, he again journeyed to offer congratulations. The emperor received him in the inner palace for a banquet. In the fourth month, imperial favor was extended, and a decree reaffirmed his honorific title. In the sixth month, he was elevated by edict to the rank of *\"Zhengyi Successor of the Teachings, Pure Void, Tranquil Simplicity, Radiant Ancestor, Propagator of the Dao, Reverent and Serene, Cavern-Mystery Great Perfected One,\"* charged with overseeing all Daoist affairs throughout the realm.\n\nThereafter, rainbows frequently appeared, filling the valleys with light before dissolving. When news of his passing reached the court, the emperor dispatched Eunuch Lei Chun to offer sacrifices in his honor. He was further honored with burial on the right flank of the Northern Perfected Abbey.\n\n*Concluded: Records of the Han Celestial Masters, Scroll Three*\n*Records of the Han Celestial Masters, Scroll Four*\n\nThe Forty-Fifth Celestial Master, named Maocheng, styled Wenkai, with the sobriquet Jiuyang, maintained a serene and detached heart, untethered by worldly attachments, and was also known as Danran. He was the direct descendant of Chongxu and the nephew of Qishan and Xibi. Initially, his father Yuli was seated in the central courtyard on the twelfth month of the *bingyin* year of the Hongwu era when a Daoist suddenly appeared for an audience, his attire and appearance most extraordinary. The visitor called himself Chongyangzi and presented a chrysanthemum plant, saying, \"I humbly request lodging under your roof for sixty years.\" With these words, he vanished. At first, Yuli found this strange, but later realized it was the Perfected One Chongyang. The following ninth month on the ninth day, the Celestial Master was born, and the fragrance of chrysanthemums filled the room while purple clouds enveloped the house, dissipating only after three days. At the age of four, he imitated the *Yu step*, and faint thunder rumbled in response. Thinking it coincidental, he was asked to repeat the step, and the thunder resounded even louder. When taught the Confucian classics and esoteric Daoist texts, he memorized ten thousand words a day, and his literary compositions and calligraphy surpassed his contemporaries. Once, while traveling through mountains and marshes, someone warned of a fallen tree blocking the path ahead. The attendants suggested taking a side route, but the Celestial Master said, \"I bear the responsibility of guiding the people. A true person does not take crooked paths.\" Shortly after, a fierce wind arose, and upon arrival, the tree had already been uprooted. Upon entering the capital and passing through Wulin, where an epidemic raged, the afflicted sought talismans in such numbers that he could not fulfill all requests. He then inscribed a massive talisman and cast it into a well. The people rushed to draw the water, which soon ran dry, yet those who drank were cured. When he traveled to Huagai Mountain, auspicious lights frequently appeared, and at night, heavenly lamps shone like scattered stars. His numinous efficacy manifested in many such ways.\n\nIn the twenty-second year of the Hongwu era, his father Yuli was summoned by the Taizu Emperor along with the Perfected One of Wuwei. Their audience was greatly appreciated, and they were rewarded with gold and silk. The emperor commanded the former Censor-in-Chief, the Duke of Sincerity Liu Ji, to betroth his brother’s daughter to the Celestial Master, who was thus born of the Liu clan. When he later had an audience, he was granted a banquet in the Convenience Hall. The following year, he was ordered to transmit the *Tai Shang Yan Xi Lu* and conduct the *Yan Xi* Offering in the imperial palace. Upon completion, he was bestowed with a coronet, robes, a sword, and other regalia. In the fourth month, he accompanied the emperor in offering sacrifices at the Imperial Ancestral Temple and was conferred by edict the title *\"Zhengyi Successor of the Teachings, Reverent Cultivator of the Supreme Dao, Preserver of Simplicity, Propagator of the Dharma, Perfected One,\"* charged with overseeing all Daoist affairs.\n\nIn the spring of the *jiyou* year, he attended the imperial birthday celebration and was ordered to conduct offerings at the Eastern Sacred Mount Altar and perform the Offering in the Hall of Benevolence and Wisdom, receiving further rewards. In the third month, the emperor summoned him to the Western Palace and, greatly pleased with their conversation, recommended the eminent Daoists Cao Kehong, Gong Jizong, Yan Fuyuan, and Huang Jiayou of the Supreme Clarity Abbey for positions in the Daoist Registry. The emperor approved and dispatched the eunuch Li Du to the mountain to summon them. In the twelfth month, an edict posthumously honored his late wife, Lady Sun, with the title *\"Gentle, Auspicious, Chaste, and Tranquil Mystic Lady.\"*\n\nIn the *xinhai* year, he had an audience and was ordered to conduct offerings at the Altar of the Stars and perform the Offering at the Inner Imperial Altar, receiving gifts of eight treasures from the imperial workshops and gold and silk. In the fourth month, he accompanied the emperor in offering sacrifices at the Imperial Ancestral Temple. Upon completion, a eunuch was specially dispatched to escort him back to the mountain.\n\nIn the winter of the *guichou* year, he had an audience, and the following spring, he was ordered to perform the Offering at the Abbey of Numinous Aid. In the third month, when the heir apparent fell ill, he was summoned to treat him, and the prince recovered. The emperor was delighted and bestowed upon him a coronet, sword, and robes. He was ordered to conduct offerings at the Altar of Wind, Clouds, Thunder, and Rain and perform the *Bao’an* Offering at the Abbey of Great Virtue, receiving further gifts of gold and silk. Five hundred ordination certificates were issued to tonsure Daoist priests. Though he sought to return home, he was detained.\n\nIn the fifth month, he was summoned for an audience in the inner court and was presented with the emperor’s *Zhao Yin Ge* (Song of Summoning the Recluse) to take back to the mountain. Upon reaching the post station at Jia Ma Camp, the emperor again dispatched an envoy to bestow secret instructions, exhorting him to cultivate the Daoist arts and not to neglect the ancestral teachings.\n\nWhen the Ruizong Emperor ascended the throne in the Zhengtong era, the Celestial Master attended the court to offer congratulations. An edict was issued to construct the Celestial Master’s Residence in the northeastern corner of the Chaotian Abbey, a command of the late emperor that was now completed. Ritual officials were sent to welcome him to reside there, and he was provided with provisions. He was ordered to conduct the *Sheng Zhen* Grand Fast at the abbey. The following New Year’s Day, he was granted a banquet in the Hall of Heavenly Favor. On the eleventh day, he was ordered to conduct offerings at the Altar of Wind, Clouds, Thunder, and Rain. The next day, he was summoned for an audience and then invited to dine with the Duke Yansheng in the Convenience Hall, each receiving gifts of gold, silk, python robes, and vermilion shoes. That month, he was ordered to transmit the *Tai Shang Yan Xi* scriptures and conduct the *Jin Lu Yan Xi* Offering at the Chaotian Abbey, receiving further rewards.\n\nIn the spring of the *jiwei* year, he was ordered to conduct offerings at the Eastern Sacred Mount Altar. In the second month, on the empress dowager’s birthday, he conducted the *Zhu Yan* Offering at the Chaotian Abbey. Upon completion, he was bestowed with gold and silk. In the *gengshen* year, an edict honored his second wife, Lady Dong, with the title *\"Warm, Tranquil, Gentle, and Compliant Mystic Lady.\"* In the third month, he was ordered to install and offer sacrifices to the golden statue of the Dark Emperor at the Dark Heaven Shrine in the imperial palace. After the rites, he was commanded to present his ancestral seal and sword for the emperor’s inspection. The emperor examined them for a long time, sighing, \"Truly, these are divine and numinous objects!\" He then hosted a banquet and bestowed further rewards before sending him off.\n\nIn the first month of the *xinyou* spring, he was ordered to conduct offerings at the Eastern Sacred Mount Altar and perform the Offering at the Chaotian Abbey. Five hundred and two ordination certificates were issued to tonsure Daoist priests, and he was generously rewarded before returning. In the winter of the *renxu* year, he attended the court and was granted a banquet in the Hall of Literary Splendor.\n\nIn the spring of the *guihai* year, he was ordered to conduct offerings at the Altar of the Stars and perform the Offering at the Chaotian Abbey. The following year, he sought to return home. In his memorial, he stated: \"I have been showered with the favor of two reigns, yet I have no means to repay even a fraction. I fear my Heaven-bestowed years are limited and that I may not long bask in Your Majesty’s radiant presence. I have a son who died young, but my eldest grandson, Yuanji, though only of age, possesses an extraordinary nature. I humbly request that he take my place to repay the imperial grace.\" The emperor repeatedly urged him to stay, but eventually permitted him to return home. He entrusted the seal and sword to Yuanji, saying, \"I have received the court’s approval. My child, exert yourself and forever uphold Heaven’s favor.\" With these words, he sat upright and passed away at the age of fifty-nine, fulfilling the sixty-year lodging promised by Chongyangzi.\n\nWhen news of his death reached the court, an edict was issued to dispatch the Minister of Rites Zhao Zui to offer sacrifices in his honor, and the Ministry of Works official Jiang Qing to oversee his burial on Ma’an Mountain. An abbey named Southern Culmen was established there to honor him.\n\nThe Forty-Sixth Celestial Master, named Yuanji, styled Mengyang, with the sobriquet Taihe, was the grandson of Danran and the posthumously honored Serene Perfected’s son. His mother, the Mystic Lady Gao, dreamed of the Long-Star descending like a rainbow, transforming into a white phoenix that alighted upon her bosom. Upon waking, the room remained suffused with light, and she conceived. In the spring of the *yimao* year, on the ninth day of the first month, he was born, and at that moment, a lingzhi mushroom emerged from beneath the base of a wooden pillar. From childhood, he was exceptionally bright and quick-witted, mastering his grandfather’s secret texts and Confucian classics at a single glance. He delighted in composing poetry, yet his verses transcended worldly language, leaving all who read them in awe.\n\nIn the winter of the *yichou* year of the Zhengtong era, he journeyed to the capital at the tender age of eleven. The emperor, struck by his precocious wisdom, summoned him to the inner court, seated him, and offered tea. He was then bestowed with an edict appointing him as the Orthodox Unity Successor of the Teachings, the Unassuming and Pure Inheritor of the Ancestral and Venerable Daoist Methods, Perfected of Authentic Oneness, to oversee Daoist affairs. Laden with generous gifts, he returned home.\n\nThe following winter, he was summoned to the Renzhi Hall, where he was ordered to inscribe a talisman for Marshal Zhao. Suddenly, the roar of a divine tiger echoed, startling the emperor, who marveled and praised him. He was granted a coronet, robes, jade pendants, and gold and silk, while his father, Liu Gang, was posthumously honored as the Orthodox Unity Successor of the Teachings, the Reverent and Mystic Cultivator of Tranquility, Serene Perfected. His mother, Lady Gao, was enfeoffed as the Compassionate, Benevolent, Serene, and Chaste Mystic Lady.\n\nIn the *dingmao* year, the emperor, mindful of his youth and orphaned state, issued stern edicts to prohibit his clansmen from bullying or humiliating him. He further appointed officials such as the Assistant Instructor and Scribe to assist him. In the *wuchen* year, the emperor received him at the Dashan Hall, and his responses met with approval, earning him gifts of a bejeweled coronet and embroidered robes. In the *jisi* year, on New Year’s Day, he was commanded to conduct the secondary sacrifice at the Altar of the Stars.\n\nIn the third month, he sought leave to return home, but the emperor urged him to stay. That summer, in the sixth month, thunder shattered the roof tiles of the Jinshen Hall, striking the *chiwen* ornament, and rain persisted for ten days. When summoned to inquire about the emperor’s well-being, he cautioned against border threats. The emperor ordered a rite for clear skies at the Chaotian Abbey and summoned the Thunder God. A great eagle with azure spurs and crimson wings soared in on a mighty wind, shrieking at the Penglai Gate. It seized the talisman, ascending through the clouds, while onlookers paled in astonishment. The skies cleared instantly. The court officials, hearing of the emperor’s astonishment and delight, bestowed even greater rewards.\n\nIn the seventh month, as the emperor embarked on his northern expedition, the empress commanded a rite for his safety in the inner court. When the Jingtai era began, in the eighth month, the Jing Emperor summoned him for an audience, questioning him repeatedly. He was ordered to perform a rite to safeguard the nation at the Dade Abbey, where auspicious clouds of celestial flowers and towering peaks appeared, prompting imperial praise and rewards.\n\nThe following year, in the first month, he was granted a thousand ordination certificates to tonsure Daoist priests. In the winter of the *renshen* year, he conducted a rite in the inner court, and upon its completion, was feasted at the Renzhi Hall. In the spring of the *guiyou* year, he was commanded to conduct the secondary sacrifice at the Altar of Wind, Clouds, Thunder, and Rain at the Chaotian Abbey.\n\nIn the spring of the *yihai* year, the emperor received him at the Wenhua Hall and inquired about the secret methods of the Thunder Gods. When he inscribed a talisman, the emperor exclaimed in delight, “A lineage of divine brilliance, unbroken through the generations—truly, you are a worthy successor!” This was deemed a great honor. In the fourth month, he was ordered to perform the Golden Register and Yellow Register grand rites at the Lingji Abbey. Auspicious clouds, five-colored and swirling like a chariot canopy, gathered over the altar, while phoenixes and cranes arrived early, drawing tens of thousands of spectators. The court officials reported this to the emperor, who praised him and issued an edict, promoting him to Orthodox Unity Successor of the Teachings, the Unassuming and Pure Inheritor of the Ancestral and Venerable Daoist Methods, the Serene and Tranquil, Mystic and Harmonious Great Perfected, to oversee all Daoist affairs. He was granted a jade coronet, jade pendants, robes, shoes, and other gifts. A ritual sword was specially forged by the imperial workshops and bestowed upon him, with an imperial envoy escorting him back to his mountain.\n\nIn the first year of the Tianshun era, when Emperor Yingzong the Wise was restored to the throne, Yuanji entered the capital in the second month to offer congratulations. He was commanded to perform a rite of thanksgiving in the inner court, receiving even greater favor and rewards. In the seventh month, edicts were issued to suppress the fraudulent distribution of talismans and to prohibit clansmen from bullying him.\n\nIn the winter of the *jimao* year, he entered the capital and was feasted in the inner court. The emperor again commanded the transmission of the *Taishang Yanxi* and other secret texts. In the spring of the *gengchen* year, he was ordered to assist in the sacrifices at the Altar of Heaven. The emperor, observing the fast in the imperial retreat, questioned him, and his responses met with approval. He was granted a robe of golden chainmail and an edict, while his mother, Lady Gao, was promoted to Grand Mystic Lady.\n\nIn the fourth month of the *xinsi* year, the emperor dispatched an envoy bearing a precious edict to his mountain, summoning him to the capital to perform a rite at the Xuantian Shrine in the palace. Auspicious signs appeared. In the seventh month, as flames from the God of Fire raged at the Chengtian Gate, he was ordered to perform a rite of exorcism and thanksgiving at the Chaotian Abbey. On the seventh day, the river surged, and the palace moat overflowed. The emperor, deeply impressed, bestowed upon him coronets, robes, swords, and other regalia, along with graded rewards for his disciples.\n\nHe was again summoned for an audience, where he petitioned for a general amnesty. The following year, in the third month, he took leave of the emperor and returned to the Di River. The emperor dispatched Liu Sheng, a centurion of the Embroidered Uniform Guard, to escort him with the original travel warrants, augmented by swift horses and boats.\n\nIn the spring of the *jiashen* year, he entered the capital. As the emperor ascended the throne, omens appeared, and he was ordered to inscribe a talisman to suppress them. The next morning, a strange bird was found dead beneath the felt mat. The emperor commanded the eunuch Qian Yi to lead guards to the Chaotian Abbey, where it was burned to ashes, and the disturbances ceased.\n\nOnce, the emperor awoke from sleep with a dull pain in his foot, which he endured until dawn. Upon inspection, a black mark resembling a finger’s imprint was found. An imperial envoy was sent to convey the emperor’s concern, and Yuanji presented talismanic water to wash it away. The mark faded, and the ailment vanished.\n\nSoon after, as the emperor presided in the Hall of Heavenly Favor, a sound like falling timber or crushing stone echoed from the sky. The emperor, alarmed, ordered rites of exorcism and thanksgiving. That night, the noise ceased, and Yuanji was held in even higher esteem. An edict promoted him to Orthodox Unity Successor of the Teachings, the Profoundly Enlightened and Mystically Responsive, the Silent and Tranquil, the Dao-Expounding and Transformation-Manifesting Great Perfected, to oversee all Daoist affairs. His mother, the Compassionate, Benevolent, Serene, and Chaste Grand Mystic Lady Gao, was further honored as the Compassionate, Harmonious, Upright, Benevolent, Chaste, and Virtuous Grand Mystic Lady. Laden with generous gifts, he returned to his mountain.\n\nWhen Emperor Xianzong the Pure ascended the throne, in the ninth month of the first year of the Chenghua era, Yuanji entered the capital to offer congratulations and was feasted at the Wenhua Hall.\n\nThe following year, in the first month, the Emperor dispatched eunuch officials bearing imperial gifts: fine horses from the celestial stables, brocade, vermilion crows, yellow-sealed documents, superior incense, exotic fruits, and sea fish, as birthday offerings. The next day, Yuanji entered the palace to express gratitude and was again feasted within the inner court. On the eleventh day, he was commanded to preside over the offerings at the Altar of Wind, Clouds, Thunder, and Rain.\n\nIn the second month, he was ordered to conduct the Ascension to Perfection Ritual at the Temple of Great Virtue. The Emperor issued decrees prohibiting clansmen from encroachment and others from forging talismans and registers, while appointing Assistant Instructors, Scribes, and other officials to aid in the governance of Daoist affairs.\n\nIn the autumn of the *dinghai* year, he entered court and was summoned to the Hall of Great Goodness, where he was commanded to present the ancestral seal and sword for the Emperor’s inspection. His Majesty, with his profound gaze, examined them for a long while and sighed, “Such treasures, so rare and resonant—truly, they possess divine efficacy.” He was then feasted before departing.\n\nIn the eleventh month, the Emperor once more ascended the Hall of Great Goodness to summon and confer with him. The imperial address exhorted him to protect the state and pacify the people. He was bestowed a golden seal for the Orthodox Unity Successor of the Teachings Great Perfected Residence, along with an additional jade seal. The Emperor personally inscribed the characters “Great Perfected Residence” and ordered them carved and mounted upon the gate of his estate. Threefold imperial grace was conferred, and his title was further elevated to Orthodox Unity Successor of the Teachings, the Profoundly Silent and Mystically Perceptive, the Dao-Expounding, Transformation-Manifesting, Virtue-Assisting, Sage-Protecting, and Wondrously Responsive Great Perfected, charged with overseeing all Daoist affairs throughout the realm. Eunuch Qin Qin was dispatched bearing gifts: python robes, jade belts, coronets, boots, swords, tablets, and pendants—such imperial favor was unparalleled. The court and the realm alike honored him.\n\nIn the winter of the *jichou* year, he was summoned to court and commanded to perform the Golden Register Ritual at the Temple of Heavenward Ascent. Afterward, he took leave to wander, ascending renowned mountains and seeking the former retreats of immortals. Six years passed before he returned, proceeding directly to the fork below Dragon-Tiger Peak, where he built a thatched hut and abstained from grains for three years.\n\nOne day, having completed his written hymn, he sat upright and transformed, his body as light as an empty robe. He was interred in his native village at Bo Ji Bay.\n\nThe Forty-Seventh Heavenly Master, named Xuánqìng, styled Tiānxī, with the sobriquet Zhēnyī and also called the Seven-One Elder, exhibited extraordinary signs at birth. He was broadly learned and skilled in literature, excelling in poetry and classical texts.\n\nIn the *dīngyǒu* year of the Chenghua reign, he was summoned to court and feasted in the inner palace. Eunuch Liáng Fāng was dispatched to convey the imperial decree, betrothing the daughter of Duke Zhū Yí of Chengguo to him as his consort. The following year, he was ordered to journey to the southern capital to complete the marriage. He was further bestowed python robes and a jade belt, and provided with swift horses and boats for his return. He was then invested as the Orthodox Successor of the Zhengyi Tradition, the Great Perfected Who Preserves Harmony, Cultivates Simplicity, Inherits the Ancestral Dao, and Oversees the Affairs of Daoism, while his mother, Lady Wú, was enfeoffed as the Mysterious Sovereign of Aspiring Virtue and Tranquil Serenity.\n\nIn the *jiǎchén* year, an edict was issued to strictly prohibit the forgery and private distribution of talismans, as well as the theft of fish from the ponds of released life. In the spring of the *yǐsì* year, the Jiangxi provincial officials were specially instructed to rebuild the residence of the Great Perfected, and he was commanded to offer incense at Mount Dahuagai and the Iron Pillar Palace. In the *bǐngwǔ* year, he was summoned to court and ordered to perform the Jiao Ritual at the Hall of Reverent Peace, where he received gifts of a jade belt and gold silk.\n\nUpon the ascension of the Xiaozong Emperor, in the *wùshēn* year of the Hongzhi reign, he presented congratulations at court and received even greater imperial favor. In the summer of the *gēngxū* year, when lightning struck a pillar of the Hall of Solemn Vigilance, he was ordered to perform a prayer and thanksgiving Jiao at the Hall of Reverent Peace. Heaven responded with auspicious omens of falling blossoms and propitious clouds, for which the emperor commended him and further commanded him to perform a Jiao for the imperial heir within the palace. The following year, upon the birth of the crown prince, he was bestowed a carved jade belt inscribed with \"Heavenly Fortune\" and \"Longevity,\" a gold coronet, python robes, and silver silk.\n\nIn the *bǐngchén* year, the emperor dispatched eunuchs Lǐ Jǐn and Lǐ Zhēn bearing gifts, ordering him to conduct the Great Jiao for the Protection of the People at the Supreme Clarity Palace, with Governor Dèng Yuán and the two provincial commissioners officiating the rites. Auspicious omens of cranes dancing in the sky and clouds resembling canopy appeared. In the winter of the *wùwǔ* year, he was ordered to pray for snow at the Temple of Heavenward Ascent, and the following day, heavy snow fell. In the spring of the *jǐwèi* year, he was commanded to transmit the *Secret Records of Supreme Prolonged Felicity*, receiving two boxes of ivory-carved seals and gold silk before taking leave.\n\nIn the fifth month, as his boat passed the Gutou Sluice, the water was too shallow to proceed. The assistant magistrate Méng requested a prayer, so he inscribed an iron talisman and cast it into White Elephant Pool. By dusk, clouds gathered densely, and rain poured down in torrents, allowing his banners and flags to advance. In the winter of the *xīnyǒu* year, he was summoned to court with his heir. The emperor received them in the Hall of Reverent Peace, bestowing robes and a belt upon the heir and commanding them to be seated. They were feasted within the hall, and his request to retire was granted.\n\nThe following spring, upon his return from offering sacrifices at the Changling Mausoleum, he was feasted in the side hall and honored with an edict of retirement. In the fourth month, he was dispatched to offer incense at the Five Sacred Mountains: Tianmu, Gexian, Huagai, Wudang, and Heming. Upon his return, he reported his mission and was rewarded with a banquet. The emperor further ordered the Tongzhou Guard to dispatch officers and soldiers to escort him back to the mountain.\n\nIn the *jiǎzǐ* year, his heir was summoned to court and presented with a self-painted sacred portrait and an ancient sword desired by the emperor. In return, the emperor bestowed upon him a portrait of the Ancestral Heavenly Master and gold silk. In the second month of the *yǐchǒu* spring, the emperor, mindful of his devotion, specially issued an edict of commendation and further instructed him to journey to the Three Sacred Mountains—Wudang, Heming, and Gexian—bearing imperial incense and candles to be conveyed to the mountains as an expression of reverence for the deities.\n\nThereupon, he ascended perilous peaks and explored numinous caves. Later, while traversing the rugged paths of Heming Mountain, he encountered an old man in crane-like robes with the countenance of a crane, who approached and bowed to him. The old man laughed and said:\n*\"Coming and going, one hears not the mountain crows’ clamor;\nUpon the Three Lives’ stone, the dragon and snake mark the years.\"*\nWith that, he brushed his sleeves against the green cliff and vanished. The Heavenly Master lingered for a long while before returning in melancholy.\n\nIn the ninth month of the *jǐsì* autumn, he hosted a banquet for his guests and drank to great merriment. Raising his cup, he addressed Prefect Lín and Vice-Commissioner Wáng, saying: *\"I have an old friend’s appointed time to keep, and I fear this gathering may be difficult to repeat. Yet you, my lords, bear the hopes of governing an era of peace—strive on.\"* All present took his words as drunken ramblings and paid them no heed.\n\nAfter the wine was finished, he instructed his attendants to place a rush cushion to the west of the Dark Altar. Composed and at ease, he faced north in cross-legged meditation. Reciting once more the old man’s words, he transformed, leaving his mortal remains enshrined at the Longevity Abbey in Jīnxī.\n\nThe Forty-Eighth Heavenly Master, named Yànchán, styled Shìzhān, with the sobriquet Zhànrán, was born after the True Unity Elder dreamed of a divine being planting a catalpa in his courtyard, girded with a sword. In his youth, he bore the manner of his grandfather and father. In the *xīnyǒu* year of the Hóngzhì era, at just twelve years of age, he accompanied his father to court by imperial summons. The emperor regarded him with wonder, hosting a banquet in his honor at the Qīn’ān Hall and bidding him sit. The Three Palaces all summoned him for an audience, bestowing rewards of varying degrees. He was conferred the title of *Zhēnyī Sìjiào Zhìxū Chōngjìng Chéngxiān Hónghuà Zhēnrén*, Master of the Orthodox Unity Teachings, Inheriting the Void and Embracing Stillness to Uphold the Ancestral Dao and Transform All, charged with overseeing the affairs of Daoism throughout the realm. Upon returning home, he sought learning but received no esoteric transmissions. After delving deeply into the ancient classics, he served his parents with utmost filial devotion, earning the praise of his clan and village.\n\nWhen the Martial Ancestor Emperor ascended the throne, in the spring of the *bǐngyín* year of the Zhèngdé era, the Heavenly Master entered the capital to offer congratulations and was summoned for an audience. The emperor asked, *\"Is your ancestral master not a divine immortal? I have heard that divine immortals endure forever. Might one still meet them today? And can one learn their ways?\"* The Heavenly Master replied, *\"I have heard that those who surpass divine immortals are rulers like Yáo and Shùn, who endure to this day. From the Son of Heaven to the common folk, none have failed to witness their legacy. If Your Majesty aspires to emulate them, your sagely longevity may equal heaven and earth. As for those like myself who are deemed divine immortals, what worth do we truly hold?\"* With this, he petitioned to return to his mountain.\n\nIn the *wùchén* year, he issued departmental certificates to ordain Daoist priests universally. In the *gēngwǔ* year, he memorialized the throne to request the reconstruction of the Great Supreme Clarity Palace, fulfilling the late emperor’s command. The court dispatched the eunuch supervisor Lǐ Wén, along with the regional military and civil governors of Jiāngxī, to oversee the project.\n\nIn the *rénshēn* year, he was summoned for an audience and commanded to assist in the sacrifices at the Tàitán Altar, receiving gifts of a python robe and jade belt. In the *gēngchén* year, as the imperial carriage embarked on a southern progress, rumors arose of demons lurking in the rear lake of Niúshǒu Mountain. The Heavenly Master was summoned to the imperial encampment and ordered to expel them. He indeed encountered and slew a demonic entity. The emperor was greatly pleased and ordered him to accompany the imperial retinue back to the capital.\n\nWhen the Solemn Ancestor Emperor ascended the throne, in the first year of the Jiājìng era, the Heavenly Master entered the capital to offer congratulations. The emperor bestowed inquiries upon him, to which he responded with the virtues of a pure heart and few desires, much to the emperor’s approval. The imperial favor was profound, and he was specially permitted to return to his mountain to retrieve and present the secret *Yánxǐ Lù* texts of the Supreme Ones. In the *guǐwèi* year, an edict was issued to betroth Lady Liǔ, daughter of the Marquis of Ānyuǎn, as his second wife, with the inner and outer guard officers of the southern capital ordered to escort him for the wedding procession.\n\nIn the *bǐngwǔ* year, he was granted an edict conferring the title of *Zhēnyī Sìjiào Huáixuán Bàozhēn Yǎngsù Shǒumò Bǎoguāng Lǚhé Zhìxū Chōngjìng Chéngxiān Hónghuà Dà Zhēnrén*, Great Perfected One of Orthodox Unity Teachings, Embracing the Mysterious and Preserving the True, Nurturing Simplicity and Guarding Silence, Radiant in Harmony and Upholding the Void to Embrace Stillness and Inherit the Ancestral Dao to Transform All, charged with overseeing the affairs of Daoism throughout the realm. He was further bestowed an edict of commendation, along with appointments for Fù Déyán and Shào Qǐnán of the Supreme Clarity Palace as Teaching Assistants, and Jīn Yǒngshòu and Zhān Wàngkuí as Scribes. He was then ordered to perform prayers at Mount Tàihé.\n\nIn the third month, the emperor dispatched the Left Minor Supervisor of the Directorate of Palace Eunuchs, Wú Yóu, along with the regional governors of Jiāngxī, to reconstruct the Great Perfected One’s Residence. The project included the construction of a repository for imperial decrees to house the sacred writings of successive reigns, the establishment of the Ten Thousand Dharma Ancestral Altar in the west to venerate the Supreme Emperor and the host of perfected beings, and the renovation of the Heavenly Master’s ancestral temple in the east to honor the successive generations of perfected ones. The surrounding landscape was entirely refurbished to enhance its splendor, making it the foremost blessed land of all.\n\nThe emperor commanded the casting of bronze statues, and upon their completion, the Heavenly Master led Wú Yóu to enshrine them at the Ten Thousand Dharma Ancestral Altar. He was bestowed a silver seal for the Master of Dharma and a carved ivory seal for the transmission of the ancestral lineage. An edict was issued to the Ministry of Revenue to investigate and restore the fields and grain taxes of the Supreme Clarity Palace that had been usurped by powerful families, along with prohibitions to protect them.\n\nIn the *wùzǐ* year, he entered the capital for an audience and was commanded to assist in the sacrifices at the Altar of the Stars, receiving gifts of imperial calligraphy and silk. In the *xīnmǎo* year, he again entered the capital, but the post stations delayed his journey, causing him to arrive late. When the emperor inquired as to the reason, he truthfully explained the circumstances. The emperor ordered the investigating censors to punish the officials responsible for the negligence.\n\nIn the third month of the following year, the emperor dispatched the Left Supervisor of the Directorate of Palace Eunuchs, Cáo Yù, along with the regional governors, to reconstruct the Great Supreme Clarity Palace. In the *yǐwèi* year, due to local officials improperly assigning corvée labor to the estates of his residence across various counties, he memorialized the throne. The Ministry of Revenue was ordered to deliberate, exempting him in accordance with the privileges of a first-rank official. The decision was approved, and the exemption was established as a permanent decree.\n\nIn the *dīngyǒu* year, he entered the capital for an audience, but the post stations again caused delays, as before. He memorialized to acknowledge his tardiness and apologize for the offense.\n\nBy imperial decree, the Grand Daoist Master Zhāng Yànxūn was appointed to oversee Daoism and journey to the capital to offer congratulations, as previous courts had repeatedly issued clear edicts. Local officials along the route were to provide all necessary support. If any failed in their duties, the investigating censors were to investigate and hold them accountable. Provincial governors who neglected to enforce this were likewise to be admonished. Henceforth, military and civil authorities were strictly ordered to comply without delay, as all relevant offices were to take note.\n\nThat winter, when no snow fell, he was commanded to perform prayers within the inner palace, and the response was immediate. The emperor was greatly pleased and bestowed upon him a golden crown, jade belt, python robe, and silver silk. In the *wùxū* year, he was ordered to conduct the Golden Register Grand Fast at the Inner Imperial Altar. Auspicious signs appeared: white cranes circled the altar, and rosy clouds cradled the sun. His rewards were increased accordingly.\n\nWhen he sought leave to return home, the emperor granted him an imperial escort to safeguard his journey. That year, he was summoned to Mount Qíyún to perform a grand rite of thanksgiving and expiation. Later, he memorialized the throne, requesting that the mountain’s Daoist priests be exempted from corvée labor and appointed as resident administrators, following the precedent of Mount Tàihé. The emperor granted the temple the name \"Palace of the Mysterious Heaven and Primordial Simplicity,\" exempted the remaining incense tax, and issued an edict for its protection.\n\nThat winter, the emperor’s mother passed away. The following year, the emperor presented him with a handwritten letter to express his grief and condolences. In the *jǐhài* year, during the first month, his heir was born in the new residence. Upon hearing the news, the emperor was overjoyed and personally inscribed a calligraphic message, along with gifts of gold and silk in celebration.\n\nIn the *gēngzǐ* year, considering the heir was still in swaddling clothes and could not easily travel far, the emperor dispatched the emissary Huáng Rúguì to convey his gracious exemption from the audience, allowing him to remain and attend to the child.\n\nIn the *xīnchǒu* year, imperial patents were conferred: his birth mother, Lady Zhū, was posthumously titled \"Mysterious Lady of Upright Gentleness and Compliant Virtue\"; his stepmother, Lady Sòng, \"Mysterious Lady of Gentle Kindness and Reverent Goodness\"; his wife, Lady Lǐ, \"Mysterious Lady of Serene Emptiness and Gentle Grace\"; his second wife, Lady Wú, \"Mysterious Lady of Peaceful Wonder and Constant Goodness\"; and Lady Liǔ, \"Mysterious Lady of Dignified Grace and Aspiring Dao.\"\n\nThat year, he was ordered to ordain five hundred Daoist priests, with official certificates issued by the Ministry of Rites. The emperor specially instructed the Governor of Jiāngxī, the Censor-in-Chief, to strictly prohibit fraudulent issuance of talismans by rogue commoners in Fǔzhōu.\n\nIn the *jǐyǒu* year, he was summoned to escort his heir to the capital for an audience. When their boat reached Qiántáng, the riverbed was clogged with silt, causing hardship for the people. He cast a talisman into the water, and the obstruction immediately cleared. Upon reaching Xúzhōu, the river’s flow dwindled, and the boat ran aground. He composed a poem and cast it into the water:\n\n*\"Beneath the Lǚliáng Rapids, swift as flight,*\n*A sacred isle connects to ancient Xú’s height.*\n*I pray for three feet of crimson tide,*\n*To bear the imperial barge safe to the capital’s side.\"*\n\nThat night, the waters suddenly rose, and they reached the capital gates without further delay. The emperor sent the eunuch Gāo Zhōng to welcome and convey his gratitude, bestowing upon the heir a python robe, jade belt, gold, and silk. The following day, he was summoned for an audience and hosted at a banquet in the side hall of the palace. He was commanded to compile and present the names of past Daoist masters for the emperor’s review. Soon after, an imperial letter was granted, naming his heir *Yǒngxù*.\n\nLater, he requested retirement, which the emperor approved. He took leave and returned home. In the *gēngxū* year, during the eleventh month, he dreamed of wandering Mount Tài. On the sixteenth day of the month, at dawn, he arose, bathed, and changed his robes. Then, burning incense and resting his head upon his arm, he passed away at the age of seventy-one. When the emperor heard the news, he lamented without end.\n\nAn imperial edict granted him posthumous honors in accordance with the rites for marquises, dispatching emissary Li Qi and Brocade Guard commander Wang Zhengyi to convey condolences, oversee the funeral rites, and arrange the burial. His tomb was established at the former Dieshan Academy in Yiyang County—a singular honor. The forty-ninth Heavenly Master, named Yongxu, styled Yun Cheng and also known by the sobriquet Sanyang, was born after his father, Zhanran, dreamed of an armored warrior presenting a calling card inscribed with nine characters: \"Sanyang, General.\" The card bore no further name, and as a sudden gust of wind carried it away, he awoke. The next day, Yongxu was born.\n\nFrom an early age, he mastered the esoteric classics and practiced both scholarship and swordsmanship. When venturing out, he wore a sword and roamed mountains and marshes; when at home, he shut his door, refusing all visitors and disdaining social niceties, as if scorning the world. In the *jiyou* year of the Jiajing reign, he accompanied his father to court. Upon reaching the capital, the emperor sent eunuch Gao Zhong to bestow robes and a jade belt. The following day, he was summoned to an inner palace audience, where he received graded rewards and was hosted at a banquet in the side hall. An edict then conferred upon him the titles *Zhengyi Sijiao Shouxuan Yangsu Zunfan Chongdao Da Zhenren* (Perpetual Inheritor of the Orthodox Unity Teachings, Guardian of the Mysteries, Cultivator of Simplicity, Exemplar of the Dao, Great Perfected One), entrusting him with oversight of all Daoist affairs throughout the realm. The emperor further arranged his marriage to the daughter of Duke Dingguo, Xu Yande, with Duke Chengguo Zhu Xizhong and Earl Sui’an Chen Biao presiding over the wedding rites.\n\nIn the *renzi* year, he presented himself at court, where the emperor dispatched eunuch Huang Jin of the Directorate of Ceremonial to decree that Heavenly Master Zhang Yongxu be granted the rank of earl, with ceremonial robes for court audiences and regular sacrifices. The Ministry of Rites and Ministry of Works were further ordered to craft and present official regalia to elevate his standing in the court hierarchy. In the spring of the *guichou* year, another imperial decree reaffirmed the marriage, and after the ceremony, he was escorted back to the mountains under official guard. The Ministry of War was instructed to issue additional post station warrants beyond the usual quota to ensure a smooth journey. In the *yimao* year, he petitioned for funds to rebuild the Zhengyi, Jingying, and Xiangfu Observatories, as the allocated budget proved insufficient. The emperor approved additional funding to complete the project.\n\nIn the winter of the *wuwu* year, he returned to court. The emperor inquired, \"How has your father’s health and diet been of late?\" Yongxu replied, \"My father and I have been bathed in Your Majesty’s boundless grace, and our entire household enjoys the blessings of peace. Yet my father, sensing his strength wane like an old hound’s, has often exhorted me to strive for repayment, never daring to forget Your Majesty’s favor even for a moment.\" The emperor asked, \"But does your father still hope to return to court?\" After bestowing a banquet, Yongxu was dismissed.\n\nThat year, an edict ordered local officials to exempt the Zhengyi lineage from all miscellaneous taxes and levies, while the Ministry of War was instructed to issue travel permits under the new regulations, ensuring the provision of horses, swift boats, and strict enforcement to prevent delays or disrespect. Later, he was summoned for another audience and hosted at a banquet in the side hall. The emperor commanded him to conduct a grand *jiao* ritual for the protection of the state and the people at the Chaotian Palace, bestowing upon him a python robe and jade belt. On the thirteenth day of the first lunar month the following year, the emperor sent eunuch Zhao Xian with an urgent decree, urging him to return home early to ease his father’s longing. Thus, without awaiting the conclusion of the grand ceremony, he took leave and departed.\n\nIn the winter of the *jiazi* year, he returned to court, where the emperor summoned him to the Western Gardens for an audience, bestowing a banquet and gifts including a python robe and jade belt. On New Year’s Day of the *yichou* year, the emperor specially dispatched a eunuch to command that he precede all other ministers in entering the side hall for an audience. Afterward, he was hosted at a banquet alongside seven officials, including Grand Secretary Xu Jie, with the Heavenly Master seated at the head of the table. He conducted a *jiao* ritual within the palace and was further entrusted with presiding over the spring prayer ceremonies. Upon their completion, he urgently requested to return to the mountains. While his boat paused at Yanling Rapids, he suddenly rose, pushed open the cabin window, and gazed at the evening glow over the mountains. After a long moment, he spoke:\n\n*\"Nine by nine, nine,*\n*Homeward bound—how many peaks divide us?*\n*Green remains, yet nothing endures.*\n*At Dinghu, the fire-dragon’s whiskers shall fall,*\n*But I ride the golden ox ahead.\"*\n\nShortly after, he added:\n\n*\"Do not grieve when you turn back in the dark,*\n*For at dawn, the sun still rises as before.\"*\n\nHis voice trailed off, leaving all present astonished. He then instructed the boatman to hasten onward. He returned home not long after and passed away.\n\nUpon receiving the report of his wife Lady Xu’s passing, the Emperor was deeply grieved and bestowed posthumous honors in accordance with the rank of a count, dispatching the emissary Yao Guangfu to convey imperial condolences and oversee the burial site at Lion Lane. A shrine was established at the Southern Dipper Abbey, and Lady Xu was posthumously enfeoffed as the Serene Harmony Primordial Sovereign. The Emperor further issued an edict sternly admonishing all clan members against any disrespect or mistreatment. Such was the profound imperial favor, the care extended to preserve and perpetuate the esoteric lineage, that the ancestral heritage might endure and the clan’s prestige be forever upheld.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: *\"Manifest the Dao, divine the power of virtue, and conduct oneself accordingly—thus may one commune with the spirits and receive their protection.\"* That which fills heaven and earth, enduring from antiquity to the present without cease, is the Dao. To make the Dao manifest is to reveal its wondrous efficacy, aligning with virtue, so that one may respond to all transformations and aid the spirits in their work—this is what it means to assist in the transformation and nurturing of heaven and earth.\n\nSima Qian observed: *\"The Daoists practice non-action, concentrate their spirit, and move in harmony with the formless. They suffice for all things, adapt to the times, respond to change, establish customs, and undertake affairs—nothing is beyond their scope.\"* How true this is.\n\nThe Most High Lord was born in the Yin dynasty and served as the Keeper of Archives for the Zhou. Later, as the Historian Beneath the Pillar, he descended to the world in an unfathomable divine transformation, becoming the patriarch of the esoteric teaching. Our ancestor, the Han Celestial Master, inheriting the legacy of the Marquis of Liu, personally received the Dao from the Most High. Thus, the cavern-classics and hidden esoterica, long untransmitted, were fully revealed to the world. Thereafter, he subdued demons and malevolent spirits, refined the elixir of immortality, and upon achieving transcendence, passed down the sword and seal through successive generations—a tradition now spanning fifteen hundred years. Though dynasties have changed and the world transformed, the succession has never faltered. Is this not because the teaching of purity and non-action, its wondrous efficacy aligned with the virtue of heaven, suffices to assist in the transformation and nurturing of all things?\n\nTo this day, in every renowned mountain and sacred retreat, the numinous traces remain. From this, one may see how the descendants’ far-reaching renown and enduring glory are indeed the result of their subtle harmonization with the imperial order and their boundless beneficence toward the people.\n\nFrom the end of the Han onward, those dwelling on Dragon-Tiger Mountain lived in seclusion among cliffs and valleys, cultivating and refining themselves to prolong their years. By the early Song, their Daoist practice began to earn renown in their time. During the Daoguan and Chongning eras, the Vacuous Tranquility True Lord emerged, his divine efficacy and wondrous responses fully realized in the practice of refining form through qi. Thereafter, his legacy flourished, matching the achievements of his predecessors.\n\nAmong those who followed, none surpassed my great-great-grandfather, the Master of Misty Mountain, and my great-grandfather, the Master of Supreme Mystery. Their illustrious deeds in prayer and supplication, their unparalleled favor from the throne—such marvels and blessings were so abundant that even the most eminent scholar-officials revered them, a reverence perhaps unmatched by earlier generations.\n\nIn our dynasty, my late father, the Master of Profound Emptiness, lived in an era of sagely brilliance and universal peace. His towering virtue and majestic prestige shone brightly in his time, his honors enduring from beginning to end—how could the past compare? Such must be the legacy of those born of divine lineage.\n\nI, Yu Chu, unworthy and mediocre, have been entrusted with continuing the ancestral legacy. Yet I tremble at the weight of this responsibility, ever fearful of falling short of the imperial grace bestowed upon me. Moreover, the history of our clan has not been fully recorded for posterity, and I worry that omissions may persist. In earlier years, my late father entrusted me with an old manuscript, which I presented to the eminent Daoist Fu Tongxu. Later, I sought a preface from the Grand Historian Song Lian, but the work remained unedited and unpublished. The original text was verbose and inelegant, so I took the liberty of revising and expanding it before committing it to print, thereby fulfilling my father’s wishes.\n\nAlas, the principle of all things is that they flourish and decline. To carry forward the past and open the way for the future is no easy task. Since the recent decline, many have abandoned substance for superficiality, competing for power and profit. If one cannot attain mastery in the teachings, radiate the brilliance of virtue, and guide one’s clan, how can they be said to have inherited the legacy of their forebears? Such understanding is beyond them.\n\nThe transmission from the Most High was one of exalted virtue and monumental achievements, its perpetuity assured. What made this possible? It is the divine and luminous nature of the Dao, which resides in the person. Those who come after must strive to emulate this, ensuring that the teachings are expounded and upheld, lest they fall into oblivion.\n\nThis work is titled *Genealogy* in the manner of historical records.\n\nRespectfully inscribed by the forty-third-generation Celestial Master, Yu Chu, with a hundred bows.\n\nOn an auspicious day of the Lantern Festival in the thirty-fifth year of the Wanli reign of the Great Ming, the year *dingwei*, the fifty-first-generation descendant Guoxiang, the Perfected One of Concentrated Sincerity, Inheritor of the Orthodox Teaching, Expounder of the Mysteries, and Grand Master for the Propagation of the Dao, entrusted by imperial decree with overseeing all Daoist affairs, supervised the carving of the printing blocks.\n\n*Genealogy of the Han Celestial Masters, Volume Four* concludes.",

In the governance of divine lineages, there are matters that cannot be omitted.\n\nThe present *Genealogy* traces its origins to the Marquis of Liu and Perfected Wen, though nothing is recorded of what came before. Relying on the *Records of Clans and Lineages*, Lian has supplemented these omissions and, following historical conventions, briefly outlined the succession of transmission, so that one may grasp the general contours at a glance, while the details are presented separately below.\n\nThe preface states: The Zhang clan descends from the Ji lineage. Hu, the fifth son of Qingyang, a descendant of the Yellow Emperor, was the first to craft bows and arrows, establishing their use for hunting and sacrifice. As the overseer of the Bow Star, his descendants were entrusted with this office and granted the surname Zhang.\n\nDuring the reign of King Xuan of Zhou, there was a minister named Zhang Zhong. His descendants later served the state of Jin as grand officers. Zhang Hou begot Lao; Lao begot Junwu; Junwu begot Qu; Qu begot Ge; and Ge’s grandson was Yi.\n\nWhen the Three Jin divided the realm, the Zhang clan served the state of Han. Zhang Kaidi expanded Han’s territory and served as minister to Marquis Zhao and King Xuanhui. Xiang Kaidi begot Ping; Ping served as minister to King Xi and King Daohui. Ping’s son, Liang, styled Zifang, became the Han Grand Tutor and Marquis of Liu and Perfected Wen. Residing in Fengyi of Pei, he fathered two sons: the Palace Attendant Pijiang and Buyi.\n\nBuyi succeeded the marquisate and fathered two sons: Diangao and Dian. Dian begot Mo; Mo begot the Grand Marshal Jin; Jin begot the Duke of Yangling, Qianqiu, styled Wannian. Wannian begot Song; Song had five sons—Zhuang, Zan, Peng, Mu, and Shu—whose descendants flourished through their meritorious deeds.\n\nBy the Tang dynasty, the Zhang clan had become one of the forty-three eminent lineages of Anding, Fanyang, Taiyuan, Nanyang, Dunhuang, Xiuwu, Shanggu, Peiguo, Liangguo, Rongyang, Pingyuan, Jingzhao, and others, producing seventeen chancellors in all.\n\nSong begot Tong; Tong begot Wuwang; Wuwang begot Liren; Liren begot Hao; Hao begot Gang; Gang begot the Perfected of Tongwu, Dashun. Dashun begot Dao-ling, the Han Celestial Master, who became the founder of the Mystery Teachings. His lineage endured far longer and flourished even more than the earlier eminent clans. Those who discuss these matters, failing to examine the facts, assume that after the Marquis of Liu’s reincarnation and the abolition of his state, his line was extinguished. Little do they know of the proliferation of his descendants across the north and south.\n\nDao-yuan, styled Fu, was born in the tenth year of Jianwu (34 CE) on Tianmu Mountain in Wu. In his youth, he studied widely and had over a thousand disciples. Later, he was summoned to court for his forthright counsel and remonstrated vehemently against the imperial examinations. Appointed magistrate of Jiangzhou in Ba Commandery, he resigned from office and retired to Yushan north of Luoyang, where he cultivated the refinement of his bodily form.",

      "translated_text": "Emperor Zhang summoned him as Academician, but he did not go. When Emperor He ascended the throne, he was called to serve as Grand Mentor and enfeoffed as Marquis of Ji, yet he likewise declined. Instead, he took up his staff and wandered to the Huai region, entering Poyang, ascending Dragon-Tiger Mountain, and compounding the Divine Elixir of the Nine Heavens. Seeking the Western Immortal Source, he obtained the *Ordinances for Commanding the Five Peaks*, and from the Bi-Lu Grotto, he retrieved the secret texts for summoning the Ten Thousand Spirits and the Divine Tiger. Shortly after, he entered a stone chamber on Mount Song and obtained the *Yellow Emperor’s Nine Cauldrons Scripture*. When his Dao was perfected, hearing that the miasmic qi of Ba and Shu harmed the people, he resolved to enter Shu. At first, he dwelled on Yangping Mountain, then moved to Mount Heming, where the Primordial Venerable Lord repeatedly bestowed upon him the methods of scriptural transmission. Thereupon, he divided his form to manifest transformations and established the Twenty-Four *Zhi*, adding four more to correspond to the Twenty-Eight Constellations. Malevolent plagues thereby waned and vanished; his deeds—such as unsealing the Springs of Salt and breaching the Ghost City—were too numerous to record in full.\n\nIn the second year of *Yongshou* (156 CE), he moved again to Queting Mountain, where he produced the pair of *Three-Five Demon-Slaying* swords, male and female, along with the *Yangping Zhi Capital Merit Seal*, and conferred them upon his successor, Celestial Master Heng, charging him to transmit them through the generations. Then, riding the clouds, he ascended, having lived one hundred twenty-three years.\n\nHeng, styled Lingzhen, was a man of great talent. Emperor Shao summoned him as Gentleman of the Yellow Gate, but he declined and retired to Yangping Mountain, vowing to guide the people with loyalty and filial piety. The noble-minded praised him for continuing the ancestral lineage, expanding its legacy, and bringing peace and goodness to the common folk.\n\nHeng begot Master Xi Lu, styled Gongqi, who delved even deeper into the achievements of his predecessors. Teaching others through the Daoist arts, he styled himself *Master*. Those who came to study the Dao were first instructed in its practices; once they demonstrated faith, they were called *Libationers* and taught to be sincere and free from deceit.

People were permitted to take according to their needs, but those who took excessively would invite misfortune. As followers grew daily, he settled in Hanzhong, where an imperial edict appointed him Commandant of Pacification and Governor of Hanning. Subsequently, he pledged allegiance to Cao Cao, the Grand Ancestor of Wei, who bestowed upon him the title General Who Pacifies the South and enfeoffed him as Marquis of Wenzhong. His five sons were all enfeoffed as marquises, and his daughter married Pengzu, a son of the Grand Ancestor.\n\nUpon Xi Lu’s passing, he was posthumously honored as Original Marquis.\n\nXi Lu begot Sheng, styled Yuanzong, whom the Grand Ancestor of Wei enfeoffed as Marquis of Duting, though Sheng declined. Returning from Hanzhong to Mount Longhu, he encountered the Three Primordial Days and ascended the altar to transmit the register to his son, Zhaocheng, styled Daorong. Zhaocheng sat upright in a stone chamber, where tigers and leopards would prostrate themselves upon encountering him. When he departed this world, some witnessed him riding a crane through the sky.

In the late Five Dynasties period, many received his registers, so he cast tens of thousands of iron ring contracts to bind them. Jiwen begot Zhengsui.\n\nIn the eighth year of the *Great Central Auspiciousness* reign of the Song, Zhengsui was summoned to court and granted the title *Master of True Stillness*. Thereafter, all who were called *Master* received such titles. Minister of Personnel Wang Qinruo memorialized the throne to establish the Register Transmission Bureau. Zhengsui begot the *Perfected of Clarity and Simplicity*, Master Qianyao, who begot the *Perfected of Emptiness and Whiteness*, Master Sizong. Sizong begot Xiangzhong, styled Gongchen. At three months, he could walk; at five months, he could speak. At seven, he was summoned to the capital and granted a purple robe.\n\nXiangzhong begot the *Perfected of Preserved Radiance*, Master Dunfu. Dunfu had no sons, so his nephew, the *Perfected of Preserved Authenticity*, Master Jingduan, succeeded him. Jingduan also had no sons, so his younger cousin, the *Perfected of Emptiness and Serenity*, Master Jixian, succeeded.\n\nJixian, styled Jiawen, was mute until the age of five. Upon hearing a rooster crow, he suddenly sighed and composed a poem, astonishing all. In the early *Chongning* reign, the waters of the Xiefang Pond overflowed. An envoy summoned him, and he inscribed an iron talisman, casting it into the water. Thunder roared, shattering the flood dragon, which died at the water’s edge.\n\nOne day, he followed the emperor into the sleeping chambers, where palace ladies competed to have him inscribe their fans. He wrote passages from the scriptures, each secretly aligning with their thoughts. Among them, one lady prostrated herself and presented a fan, on which he wrote: *\"Protect and secure the nation’s destiny, enduring as long as Heaven.\"* It was the emperor’s own fan, who marveled at this.\n\nWhen he prayed for rain, it ceased after three days. He was appointed Grand Master of the Supreme Void but declined. An edict ordered the Jiangdong transport commissioner to survey land on the mountain, relocating and constructing the *Upper Clarity Abbey*, which was renamed the *Orthodox Unity Abbey*.

Sixteen years later, Sa Shoujian of Xihe, traveling through Qingcheng Mountain, encountered him at the gorge’s mouth. Jixian gave him a letter and a red crow, instructing him to deliver them to the succeeding Celestial Master. The Celestial Master’s household was greatly astonished, and when they had Guishan’s tomb opened, only the crow remained. Jixian had no descendants, so he designated Shixiu, the grandson of his disciple Xiangzhong, as his heir. Shixiu said, *\"I am your junior—how could I succeed you?\"* The assembly replied, *\"The succession of the Dao lies where the lineage draws it—who can refuse?\"* Thus, he complied.\n\nShixiu fathered Master Zhengying Shouzhen, who remained in his mother’s womb for nineteen months before birth. In Piling, a malevolent spirit possessed a tree, and he was summoned to exorcise it. One night, wind and thunder uprooted it. Later, he stabilized the surging Yangtze’s floods, and Emperor Gaozong bestowed upon him an ivory tablet, a precious sword, and the scriptures *Qingjing* and *Yinfu*. Shouzhen fathered Jingyuan, who fathered Qingxian. In Zhanggong Cave was a well of great depth; Qingxian playfully tore a leaf and tossed it in. Suddenly, waves surged, and an old man emerged from within. Qingxian rebuked him, and he departed. Qingxian had no sons, so his nephew, Master Guanmiao Keda, succeeded him. Keda was Shouzhen’s great-grandson; his grandfather, Bolin, and father, Tianlin, had both administered the teachings.\n\nWhen the waters of Poyang swelled, destroying countless homes, Magistrate Yuan Gufu requested Keda to intervene. He slew a large white serpent, and the waters subsided. During a drought, Keda prayed, and rain fell, ending the parched spell. He was appointed Commissioner of the Three Mountains’ Talismans, concurrently overseeing the imperial abbeys and the affairs of the Daoist teachings, and was made abbot of Longxiang Abbey.\n\nIn the late Song era, Kublai Khan of the Yuan heard of his divine efficacy and secretly sent envoys to inquire. Keda presented him with the *Lingquan* and told the envoys, *\"Serve your lord well. In twenty years, he shall unify the realm.\"* By the thirteenth year of the *Zhiyuan* reign, this proved true.\n\nKeda fathered Zongyan, styled Shichuan, who showed exceptional intelligence from youth. After Kublai conquered the Song, recalling his father’s prophetic words, he dispatched Minister of War Wang Shiying and Minister of Justice Xiao Yubao to summon him. He was bestowed a jade crown and jade tablet, granted the title *Zhendao Lingying Chonghe Zhenren*, and given a third-rank silver seal, charged with overseeing Daoist affairs in the Jiangnan region and authorized to ordain disciples as Daoists at his discretion.\n\nZongyan fathered Yudi, styled Guohua. During Kublai’s reign, he was conferred the title *Tixuan Hongdao Guangjiao Zhenren*, receiving generous rewards, but he ultimately died in the capital. Yudi had no sons, so his younger brother, Yucai, succeeded him.\n\nYucai, styled Guoliang, was received in audience at the Daming Hall in the early *Yuanzhen* reign and was granted the title *Taisu Ningshen Guangdao Dazhenren*. In the second year of the *Dade* reign, the tidal waters of Haiguan and Guano prefectures surged, eroding nearly a hundred *li* of sandy shores and threatening the prefectural city. Yucai cast an iron talisman into the water; it leapt out three times. Amidst thunder and darkness, a monstrous fish-headed, turtle-bodied creature over a *zhang* in length was slain, and the embankments returned to their former state.\n\nIn the fifth winter of the *Dade* reign, no snow fell. The emperor said, *\"Without winter snow, will the people not suffer calamity?\"* Yucai built an altar and prayed. That night, snow fell a foot deep. The emperor rejoiced and ordered his ministers to present him with wine, saying, *\"You have moved the spirits to such an extent!\"*",

He was appointed Grand Master of the Supreme Void but declined.

His disciples, numbering in the tens or hundreds, followed him.\n\nIn the early *Jingkang* reign, the emperor summoned him again.",

A silver seal was bestowed upon him, with rank equivalent to the second grade. In the ninth year, the sea embankments of Chongming Prefecture collapsed, and he dispatched his disciple to suppress the disaster with a talisman. The people dreamed of a deity filling the sea, and the land was thereafter secure.\n\nAt the beginning of the *Zhida* reign, he was further granted a precious crown and golden robes, and was conferred the title of Grand Master for Splendid Happiness with Gold and Purple, enfeoffed as Duke of Liu, and given a silver seal with rank equivalent to the first grade. Yucai’s son, Taixuanzi Sicheng, succeeded him; his Daoist practices were illustrious, and the imperial court’s rewards and honors were no less than his father’s. After Sicheng’s passing, his younger brother Side succeeded him. After Side’s passing, his son Zhengyan succeeded. After Zhengyan’s passing, Taixuan’s son Zhengchang succeeded. Styled Zhongji, he is the present Celestial Master.\n\nDuring the imperial court of the present dynasty, he paid six visits to the capital. In the early *Hongwu* reign, he was conferred the title of Grand Master of Orthodox Unity, Successor of the Daoist Teachings, Protector of the State, Expounder of the Ancestral Way, Communicator of Sincerity, Venerator of the Dao, and Propagator of Virtue, overseeing Daoist affairs. A silver seal was bestowed upon him with rank equivalent to the second grade, along with silver ingots and a golden-latticed ritual robe. His father, Daxuan, was posthumously honored as Grand Master of Vast Transformation, Illuminator of Sincerity, and Venerator of the Dao, while his mother, Lady Hu, was enfeoffed as the Reverent, Benevolent, Kind, and Serene Mystic Lady. The court further honored him with a eulogy, praising his eyes that flashed like lightning and his dignified, awe-inspiring demeanor, which brought glory to his time. This was because the hereditary transmission of the lineage required those with large, round eyes to be the \"Mystic Respondents.\" The emperor thus alluded to this trait in his eulogy.\n\nIt is said that when the Marquis of Wencheng was young, he studied rites in Huaiyang and presented himself to the Lord of the Azure Sea. The Lord of the Azure Sea was a former Confucian scholar believed to be a sea deity. Later, he encountered the extraordinary figure, the Yellow Stone Elder, beneath the bridge at Nai. Even in his early years, he had already established communication with the spirits. In his later years, having achieved fame and success, he sought to practice grain avoidance and wander with Master Red Pine, fulfilling his original aspiration—not as a pretext for self-preservation.\n\nThus, when the lineage was transmitted to the Celestial Master of the Han, his descendants were inspired to cultivate the arts of lightness and longevity, dispelling yin malevolence and transforming the people solely through the virtuous Dao. The succeeding masters continued this practice, ensuring the tradition did not decline, ever fearful that someone might suffer an untimely end. During the late Han, when the realm was in turmoil, only the region of Bashu remained tranquil. Travelers carried no provisions, and residents barred no gates; the local administration relied on this stability to govern. Such conditions endured for nearly thirty years, and his contributions to the world were truly vast. It is fitting that his descendants continue to emerge, aiding in the perfection of governance—how could this not surpass the merits of the feudal lords? Heaven’s recompense is indeed manifest.\n\nSome attribute this solely to the numinous qi of the sacred mountains, claiming it enabled such flourishing greatness. Yet this view is shallow. Alas, the descendants of the Marquis of Wencheng are found throughout the north and south. Those who distinguished themselves through meritorious deeds, whether in minor roles as illustrious masters or in major ones as chief ministers, were indeed brilliant and outstanding. Yet before long, some descended to the status of menial servants—an inescapable fate. How does this compare to the unbroken lineage of the Mystic Descendants, enduring for over twelve hundred years? There must indeed be a Dao behind this.\n\nMay those who rise hereafter take heed!

      "translated_text": "When King Wu conquered Shang, he enfeoffed eight hundred states. Examining the histories, those whose later generations can still be verified are few enough to count on one’s fingers. Yet those whose lineages remained illustrious and unbroken were only Song, Lu, Qi, Jin, Wu, Chu, Yan, Zhao, Chen, Qi, Guan, and Cai. Of these, only Yan and Qi maintained their ancestral sacrifices alongside Zhou’s own transmission. At the founding of Han, heroes rose in unison, following the High Emperor in his campaigns across the Central Plains. Once the realm was pacified, the High Emperor divided the land to enfeoff them—greater ones as kings, lesser ones as marquises—amounting to over a hundred. Yet by the first year of the later reign of Emperor Xiaowu, barely fifty or sixty years later, scarcely one or two in ten endured to the end. Emperor Xiaoxuan sought out their descendants, many of whom emerged from among hired laborers. By the time of Emperor Xiaocheng, their lines dwindled like planks on a perilous bridge—what had become of their grandeur? “Though the Yellow River narrow to a sash, though Mount Tai wear to a whetstone, the state shall endure forever”—yet only in their descendants. Viewed thus, none has sustained a lineage as enduring as Confucius, and next to him, none but the Han Celestial Master. The year after Confucius’s death, his former residence was made a temple for his worship. By the *Wude* era of Tang, the National University had its own temple; by *Kaiyuan*, every prefecture and county had one, and the realm universally offered sacrifices. A single descendant, the eldest of the lineage, inherited the title and presided over the rites. In Han times, he was the Marquis of Baocheng; in Song, the Duke Yansheng—this practice continues to this day. His cadet branches in Qufu and those scattered across the four directions have distinguished themselves through examination degrees, rising to office, achieving prominence and merit, and standing out in their generations—such men have never been lacking.\n\nThe Han Celestial Master’s lineage traces back to Marquis Liu of Wen Cheng, who was himself a descendant of Hui, the fifth son of the Yellow Emperor. From Hui through some generations to Marquis Wen Cheng, and from Marquis Wen Cheng through nine transmissions to the Han Celestial Master. From the Han Celestial Master to the present spans over twelve hundred years, with forty-three generations transmitted. Fitting sons and worthy grandsons have followed in unbroken succession, each carrying forward the brilliance of the last, illuminating and enriching what came before. No ruling house has failed to honor and exalt them. The divine lineage stretches on without end.\n\nThe Zhang and Kong clans—are they not somewhat alike? Why then have so many others vanished without trace, while these lineages grow ever more flourishing with time? There must be reasons worth understanding. When Zhou declined and no true kings arose, the feudal lords grew tyrannical, and men like Jie and Zhou stirred their cruelty to poison the realm. The people suffered calamities worse than floods or blades. Thanks to Confucius’s emergence, he refined the arts of the *ru* to propagate the kingly Way, rescuing a disordered age and restoring it to rectitude, so that all might be saved and live. Moreover, he committed the great principles and laws of governing the world to writing, providing a model for a hundred generations. Through him, the Dao of Heaven was made luminous, the patterns of Earth were made clear, and humanity found its ultimate foundation. Once the Three Powers were established, the myriad transformations were accomplished. The blessings of *Odes* and *Documents*, of benevolence and righteousness, endure as long as Heaven and Earth—thus his sacrificial legacy is truly vast, the “great virtue honored for a hundred generations.” How could the Han Celestial Master alone be different?\n\nThough the Han Celestial Master and Confucius followed different Ways, both were devoted to refining form and spirit, harmonizing with yin and yang, measuring the primal transformations, and communing with the divine. They warded off great disasters, averted great calamities, ensuring that malevolent forces did not arise, that plagues did not spread, that suffering was made safe, and that those cut off in youth lived to old age. For this world and its people, they may be said to have wrought great creation. Heaven’s nurturing of their descendants, allowing them to partake of their virtue, is but the principle of reciprocity. It is also as if to say: the house of Zhang, in its fine succession and transmission, has always had its rightful heirs. Even if natural disasters recur in every age, what cause for concern is there? These people will forever have a refuge to turn to.\n\nLet those who rise hereafter reflect on the accumulations of their ancestors, as the heavens above expect of them. If they resolutely take it upon themselves to match and exalt this legacy, then what is recorded here will be but a fraction of what is to come. The *Genealogical Record* of one scroll, detailing the forty-second-generation Celestial Master’s investiture as the Orthodox Unity Successor, Protector of the State, Expounder of the Ancestral Teachings, and Grand Perfected of Communicating Sincerity, Venerating the Dao, and Magnifying Virtue, was commissioned to his disciples for its creation. Thus, the Hanlin Academician-in-Attendance, Master Song Lian, composed its preface.\n\nThe present Celestial Master, Master Wuwei, observed that while its deeds were far-reaching, its language was refined. He had it revised and polished, intending to carve and transmit it to the world. He did not disdain me, Su Boheng, but asked me to compose a postscript. Seeing Master Wuwei’s devotion to this work, one may surmise his dedication to carrying forward the former glories and perpetuating his family’s legacy with all his remaining strength. This is why he has earned the favor of the One Man, fulfilled the hopes of the Four Assemblies, and enhanced the weight of the Mystic Teachings to that of the Nine Tripods. Though I dare not presume to follow in Master Song’s footsteps, my long-standing friendship with Master Wuwei is no recent thing. Thus, setting aside my presumption, I offer this as a preface.\n\nComposed on the *bing-shen* day of the fifth month in the *geng-wu* year of *Hongwu* by former Historiographer Su Boheng of Meishan.

      "translated_text": "In days past, when I dwelt upon the cliffs of Mystery, I dreamed of Laozi discoursing on the Dao. Privately, I was moved by the wanderings of Master Red Pine, yet knew not who would succeed his teachings. How could it compare to my recent journey to Jinling, where my sail skimmed beneath Mount Lu’s peaks? Suddenly, Perfected Zhang’s boat drew near, and we moored at dusk. Clasping hands as if long acquainted, he produced a scroll—*The Genealogy of the Han Celestial Masters*—and said, “I beg you, sir, to compose a few words to illuminate my ancestors’ legacy.”\n\nI accepted and read it, sighing, “The brush of Grand Historian Song is already immortal—what more could I add?” Yet if I must speak, I recall that the Dao of Heaven and Earth is steadfast in its singularity. Though it may darken, crumble, or fade, its inherent principle remains unshaken; its clarity and tranquility are never destroyed. The Supreme One grasped this to uphold the Way, and the Orthodox Unity Perfected—True Man of the Dao—used it to further expand the Supreme One’s lineage. Thus, numinous qi was entrusted to later generations, its wondrous efficacy enduring over a thousand years, its transformative power as constant as a single day. Who can fathom its workings? Some say talismans command spirits, avert disasters, and quell malevolent vapors, rendering service to the state—heaven’s decree to flourish their line. If so, this is but a fraction of their truth.\n\nMaster Zhang’s radiant devotion to his ancestors’ legacy suggests his resonance with the True Unity. One day, when a prince passes Dragon Mountain playing the flute, let my dream of Laozi’s discourse serve as proof: does Master Zhang not grasp its meaning? He replied, “How dare I not preserve your words and deeds for generations? I shall gaze upon the purple qi crowning Dragon Mountain’s peak.”\n\nComposed by Wang Dexin, Recipient of the Presented Scholar Degree, Former Minister of the Three Departments, Twice Summoned by Imperial Edict to Rebuild Qingyuan, Master of Luodong at Green Ridge.\n**Preface Four**\n\nNowadays, when discussing eminent lineages, none surpass the House of Kong. Yet if we rank them, the Han Celestial Masters may well rival the Kongs. The Han Celestial Master, Zhang Daoling, descended from Marquis Wen Cheng. The marquis received the *Book of the Yellow Stone*, practiced grain avoidance, and emulated Master Red Pine, deepening the wellsprings of the Dao—his origins were thus profound. Across five generations, Ancestral Master Daoling arose, embodying the Supreme One’s intent. His learning unlocked the mysteries of creation, his cultivation perfected the Dragon-Tiger path. He took the Dao and virtue as his foundation, spirit as his mother, stillness as his teacher, and harmony as his companion. Commanding wind and clouds, he strode the Three Terraces to govern the cosmos; inhaling thunder and lightning, he wielded the stellar sword to sweep away dust and miasma. Rising in the Han, his influence did not end with the Han but spanned Tang, Song, and our Ming. Imperial decrees and honors blazed across eras, his title “Orthodox Unity” equaling dukes and marquises. Even the humblest of his lineage shared in this glory—was it not the splendor of a single ancestral line?\n\nNow, fifty generations later, his descendants perpetuate the Dao’s transformative flow, their legacy most enduring. Is this not what we call an eminent lineage? Could it be second to the House of Kong? Some dismiss talismans and spirit-summoning as mere illusion. Alas, how shallow their view! Observe the Celestial Masters: they consume the six qi to refine cinnabar and transmute white stone, they embrace the Three Ultimates to harmonize with the Mysterious Origin. They existed before heaven and earth’s beginning, their origins unfathomable; they will endure beyond heaven and earth’s end, their conclusion unknown. How could their lineage alone be deemed grand?\n\nHaving roamed these wondrous realms and obtained the *Genealogy of the Celestial Masters*, how could I not compose an encomium to extol its glory? Thus, I offer this preface.\n\nComposed in the second month of spring, the *ding-you* year of *Wanli*, by Yu Wenwei of Yuzhang, Recipient of the Presented Scholar Degree, Lecturer of the Classics Bureau, and Surveillance Commissioner of Yunnan Circuit.\n**Preface Five**\n\nThe Han Celestial Masters transmitted their legacy across dynasties—through Tang, Song, and into the Ming—continuously presiding over the Daoist teachings and encompassing the realm. Yet Buddhists slandered them, and Confucians reviled them, often and without cease. Our August Emperor, divinely martial, would not deviate from the *Spring and Autumn*’s principle of grand unity. He ennobled the twenty Celestial Masters, recording and honoring their successors. From the Han to the present, their flourishing has paralleled the House of Kong—this cannot be dismissed as mere human artifice.\n\nNo lineage persists for a thousand years without constancy. To reduce their legacy to talismans and spirit-summoning is to overlook their essence. Spirits obey when commanded, yet vanish when ignored—this is their nature. To grasp them is to see spirits; to release them is to perceive the Dao. Thus, to claim talismans cannot command spirits is folly. Yet not all can wield talismans. Their use flourished with Kou Qianzhi and Du Guangting but did not endure. The Celestial Masters, however, have thrived for fifty generations, their boundless prosperity rooted in the Dao’s vastness—something beyond mortal comprehension. Otherwise, even the heroic deeds of Han Gaozu and Tang Taizong would leave no trace of their descendants today.\n\nThus, the *Mystic Radiance*’s *Admonition Against Doubt*, Li Ying’s *Records of Shu*, and their slanderous claims cannot tarnish the truth. The *Scripture of Conversion for Barbarians* does not elevate Laozi—all such assertions are false. I simply affirm the Celestial Masters’ lineage, which rivals that of Confucius’ sage descendants. Was this mere coincidence?\n\nThe *Genealogy of the Celestial Masters* was first compiled during the *Hongwu* era, when the forty-second Celestial Master sought a preface from Grand Historian Song Jin. His account was thorough. Over two hundred years later, the fiftieth Celestial Master recognized me in the capital. Our meeting was brief, yet profound. Later, when he entered the palace to pay homage at the Vermilion Gate, he visited me again. Cultured, refined, and steeped in the Dao, he suddenly dispatched a letter from afar, requesting a preface for his scroll. From *Hongwu* to *Jiajing*, eight generations’ affairs are recorded here.\n\nAged and devoted to the Dao, I dare not favor one teaching over another. How could I not acknowledge that the Three Teachings ultimately converge?",

      "translated_text": "In the autumn of the *guisi* year of the *Wanli* era, Zhou Tianqiu of Wu Commandery recorded.\n\n*Genealogy of the Han Celestial Masters, Scroll One* concludes.\n*Genealogy of the Han Celestial Masters, Scroll Two*\n\nCollated by Zhang Tie of Anren, Promoted *Jinshi*, Grand Master for Thorough Counsel, and Left Vice Minister of Works.\n\n**Preface to the Hereditary Transmission of the Celestial Masters**\n\nThe title \"Celestial Master\" appears in the *Plain Questions* and the *Zhuangzi*, being the supreme appellation for those who embody the Dao. Laozi transmitted the *Dao and Its Virtue* to the Ancestral Celestial Master of the Zhou. The Celestial Master initiated the Orthodox Unity teachings in the Han, and the Zhang lineage has now endured for forty-eight generations. The transmission of generations is recorded in such meticulous detail—how extraordinary! For fifteen hundred years, prosperity and decline have followed one another, rise and fall have succeeded in turn, yet no lineage has endured as singularly and enduringly as the Zhang family. Could this not be because they have gathered the essence of mountains and rivers, harmonized the convergence of Heaven and humanity, and thus achieved such longevity? Their legacy shall extend to posterity without end.\n\nThe Ancestral Celestial Master, named Daoling, styled Fuhan, was a native of Pei’s Fengyi. His ninth-generation ancestor, Zhang Liang, studied in Xiapei, where the Yellow Stone Elder on the ruined bridge bestowed upon him a book. Later, he aided the Han founder in conquering the realm and was enfeoffed as the Marquis of Liu for his merits. He said to the emperor, \"I wish to abandon the world of men and wander with Master Red Pine.\" His son, Buyi, succeeded him as the Marquis of Gaoyang, posthumously honored as the Cultured and Accomplished Marquis. Buyi’s son was Tong; Tong’s son was Wuwang; Wuwang’s son was Liren; Liren’s son was Hao, who became the Perfected One of Tongxiang. Hao’s son was Gang, the father of the Celestial Master. Wuwang’s son, Gang, had a son named Dashun. His mother dreamed of a divine being descending from the *Kui* star of the Northern Dipper, towering over ten feet, clad in embroidered robes, who presented her with a fragrant herb, saying, \"This is *qiangwei*.\" Upon waking, her clothing, chambers, and surroundings were imbued with an extraordinary fragrance that lingered for months. Moved by this, she conceived. On the fifteenth night of the first month in the tenth year of *Jianwu* of the Han, he was born in Tianmu Mountain of Wu. At his birth, the room was bathed in yellow and purple hues, the courtyard filled with violet qi, and the chamber radiant as daylight. The former fragrance was once more perceptible. He stood nine feet and two inches tall, with a broad forehead, crimson crown, green eyes, a high nose, square jaw, three-cornered gaze, a fine beard, arms hanging past his knees, and a bearing like a dragon crouching or tiger pacing—his presence was awe-inspiring. At seven, he read the *Book of Laozi* and grasped its meaning. He mastered the secrets of celestial patterns, geography, charts, prophecies, and apocrypha, as well as the classics and canons, with nothing escaping his comprehension. Over a thousand disciples studied under him.",

      "translated_text": "In the thirty *li* south of Tianmu Mountain and eighty *li* northwest, halls for lecture and recitation stood—Lin’an’s Divine Mountain Abbey and Yuhang’s Tongxian Abbey were among these sites. Later, he journeyed from Zhe through Yu, crossed the Huai and Yellow Rivers, and entered the Shu Mountains, where he obtained texts on refining form and harmonizing *qi*, thereafter practicing grain avoidance and sleeping little.\n\nIn the second year of *Yongping*, at twenty-five, he ranked first in the imperial examination for forthright remonstrance and was appointed magistrate of Jiangzhou. Resigning his post, he returned to Yushan north of Luoyang, where he cultivated and refined himself for three years. A white tiger then arrived at his seat, bearing a talisman in its jaws.\n\nIn the fifth year of *Jianchu*, Emperor Zhang summoned him, but he did not rise. In the first year of *Yongyuan*, Emperor He summoned him to serve as Grand Tutor to the Marquis of Jixian, but three imperial edicts went unanswered. He traveled to the Huai region and dwelled on Taiping Mountain in Tongxiang. Alone with his disciple Wang Chang, he entered Poyang from the Huai, ascending Yuping’s Yuzi Peak. The mountain spirit prostrated itself upon the path, offering to receive his commands and be enshrined upon the summit, where he might refine the elixir. The mountain spirit, perceiving his intent, sent a pair of cranes to guide his comings and goings. He then abandoned the site, and when the elixir was complete, dragons and tigers appeared—hence the mountain’s name.\n\nAt over sixty years of age, he was still robust. Following a black tiger, he traced the river’s flow into Yunjin Mountain, where he consumed herbs to further strengthen himself. A divine personage, calling himself Zhao, appeared before him, saying: “I wish to eternally guard your elixir crucible.” He then sought the Western Immortal Source, where he obtained the *Summons to the Five Peaks* and the *Inner Writ of the Three Sovereigns*, summoning the myriad spirits and the secret texts of divine tigers within the Bilu Cave. He later journeyed to the stone chamber of Songshan, where he obtained the *Yellow Emperor’s Nine-Cauldron Elixir Book* and the *Great Clarity Elixir Canon*.\n\nHe declared: “In ancient times, when Yu pacified the floods, he eradicated calamity. Now, I must do the same.” Initially, he dwelled upon Yangping Mountain, where he was instructed in the method of passing through the warp of the scriptures. Next, he ascended Xicheng Mountain to pay homage to the Five Thearchs. Someone warned him: “The White Tiger Spirit of Xicheng drinks human blood, and a great serpent lurks above. If you perish, your merit, though nearly eternal, will be in vain. Now, the earth’s *Dao* is in disarray, and our efforts are futile. If we offer humans in sacrifice, the mountains and valleys will tremble, and springs will surge forth.” He then resided on Gezan Mountain, where he practiced the Nine Perfections’ method and the art of lightening the body, though his Daoist merits remained unfulfilled.\n\nHearing of the *sha qi* in Bashu, he obtained texts on entering and exiting water and fire, as well as the *Art of Nurturing the Spirit and Returning the Crane*, on Mingming Mountain. In the first year of *Han’an*, on the *shangyuan* festival of the *renwu* year, the Most High descended in a chariot drawn by five white dragons. He recalled: “In a former life, I expounded the scriptures to Yin Xi and refined the Ninefold Benefit Elixir on a mountain. When demonic plagues arose, I did not respond; instead, I erected an altar, summoned them, and admonished them.”\n\nIn Zizhou, *xu qi* emanated for several *li*, afflicting all who entered its midst. Among the mountains of Qin—Changli, Li, Choujie, Quting, and others—he declared: “Now, I command you to universally deliver all sentient beings. Here, I shall establish the Twenty-Four *Zhi*, dispatching immortal officials to oversee the world’s sins, blessings, life, and death. For countless kalpas, the Six Heavens’ bureaucracies have governed the blood sacrifices of ghosts and spirits, usurping their rightful places and blurring the boundary between humans and ghosts. You shall restore order.”\n\nHe then bestowed upon him the *Three-Five Capital Works* and various scriptural registers, followed by the *Three-Five Demon-Slaying Male and Female Swords*, the Jade Seal and Fish-Scale Robe, the *Crown of Intertwined Yin and Yang*, the *Jade Tablet of Heavenly Communication*, and said: “After a thousand days, we shall meet in the Celestial Park.” The Heavenly Master bowed in gratitude.\n\nOn the first day of the seventh month in the second year of *Han’an*, he ascended Qingcheng Mountain. The mountain harbored a ghost city, a ghost market, and ghostly multitudes divided into eight legions, each led by a ghostly chieftain, all preying upon the people. Upon his arrival, the ghostly chieftains and their followers confronted the Heavenly Master. With cinnabar ink, he inscribed the void, and the ghostly horde instantly collapsed. Summoning them back to life, he repelled some with wind-driven fire, dispersed others with sunlight piercing the mist, confined them beneath Mount Tai, or crushed them with boulders. The ghostly beings wailed, begging for mercy and pledging obedience.\n\nHe then commanded them to assemble at the Yellow Emperor’s altar on Qingcheng Mountain, decreeing that humans dwell in the light while ghosts remain in darkness. He swore: “From this day forth, when heaven and earth unite and the sun and moon conjoin, if you dare emerge again, I shall surely slay you.” He established the Twenty-Four *Zhi*, adding four more to correspond with the Twenty-Eight Constellations. The upright *qi* descended, linking the sixty cyclical years of human birth to each *Zhi*. For each, he appointed immortal officials, yin officials, and libationers to govern them. Those who were sincere, filial, loyal, and accumulated merit were recorded by the immortal officials for their goodness, while the rebellious, treacherous, greedy, and violent were noted by the yin officials for their sins. Thus, the retribution for good and evil became swift as an echo. The people of Shu turned toward cultivation.\n\nHe designated the Thirty-Six *Jinglu*, the Seventy-Two *Fudi*, and the Three Hundred Sixty Sacred Mountains, each with its own divine overseer. Returning to Yuntai, he said to his disciple Wang Chang: “A white *qi* arises from Yangshan—it is a demon. Go and subdue it.” En route, he encountered twelve divine maidens and inquired about the location of Xianquan. They replied: “Ahead lies a great torrent, where a poisonous dragon lurks.” He cast a talisman into the waters, and the demonic abode shrieked and fled. Turning back, he plunged his sword into the earth, creating a salt well.\n\nEach of the twelve maidens offered a jade ring, pledging to receive his talismanic writings. The Heavenly Master fused the twelve rings into one and cast it into the well, saying: “Whoever retrieves the ring shall have their wish granted.” The maidens vied to descend, but he sealed the well and swore: “Henceforth, you shall be the well’s spirits, never harming the people. If hunters encounter you on the path, admonish them not to kill.” He then taught them the method of boiling salt, and the people reaped its benefits. There, they established a Heavenly Master Temple, known as the Shrine of the Lord of Qinghe, which remains venerated to this day, with prayers offered without cease.\n\nPassing through Songjiang, he discerned a demon within the river. Inscribing a stone casket, he sealed it, and the demon was eradicated. Residing on Zhubu Mountain, a divine personage presented a jade disc at night. On Benzhu Mountain, the assembled perfected ones descended to bestow the *Scripture of Numinous Treasure*. On Mount Meng, he moved to Quting Mountain, and upon reaching Yuntai Mountain, he saw peaches ripening in a sheer ravine. He asked his disciples: “Who will descend to retrieve them?”",

      "translated_text": "Zhao Sheng descended to retrieve the peaches and offered them to the Heavenly Master, then leapt down himself. Sheng and Chang followed in succession, whereupon the Heavenly Master bestowed upon them the divine elixir and the profound mysteries of the various scriptures.\n\nResiding on Liyuan Mountain, he established a platform for expounding the scriptures. On Lutang Mountain, he refined the nine-cycled divine elixir. On Pinggai Mountain, he compounded the great Nine Radiance medicine. Arriving in Chengdu, the earth yielded the Jade Bureau Examiner, who descended once more to expound the essentials of the scriptures.\n\nIn the second year of Yongshou, while traveling on Quting Mountain, he received the Jade Register from the Most High, who ordained him as the Boundless, Lofty, and Illustrious Great Emperor of the Six Harmonies. Thereafter, the Most High designated him as the grandson of the sixth generation of the Dao, with the Young Lord of the Eastern Sea as his guarantor, the Most High as his preceptor, and conferred upon Daoling the title of Heavenly Master. Three hundred disciples were initiated, though only three were appointed to succeed in governance: Zhang Shen, Wang Sheng, and Li Zhong.\n\nHe then entrusted the scriptural records, seal, and sword to his son Heng, admonishing him: “I received the Supreme Dao directly from the Most High. These texts encompass the Three and Five Steps and the Pivotal Essentials of the Orthodox Unity. Let this transmission pass to one son in each generation; it shall not be imparted to those outside our lineage.”\n\nOn that day, he bestowed the elixir upon Chang and Sheng, dividing it for consumption on Yuntai Peak. Together with his wife, Lady Yong, he ascended on clouds, having dwelt among mortals for one hundred and twenty-three years. Wang Chang and Zhao Sheng attended him, while his daughters—Wenji, Wenguang, Xianji, and Fangzhi—all attained the Dao and ascended.\n\nIn the seventh year of Tianbao, an imperial edict of the Later Han posthumously enfeoffed Heavenly Master Zhang Daoling as Grand Preceptor. In the fourth year of Zhonghe of the Tang, he was honored as the Great Dharma Master of the Three Heavens Who Upholds the Teachings. During the Shaoxing era of the Song, he was further titled the Great Dharma Master of the Three Heavens Who Upholds the Teachings and Assists the Primordial.\n\nEmperor Xuanzong of the Tang composed this eulogy:\n“In that distant Han dynasty, the celestial mandate faltered,\nAll things withered, the Three Spirits dissolved in chaos.\nOnly the Master arose in response,\nHis divine might swiftly manifest.\nHe personally attended the Mysterious Origin,\nReceiving the transmission of secret teachings.\nLike clouds, demonic toxins were dispelled;\nWith a sword, mountains of evil were cloven.\nHe broadly propagated the sacred teachings,\nPurging all accumulated malevolence.\nA single flourish of non-action,\nEver radiant, boundless in efficacy.\nPhoenix and crane soared beyond,\nHis likeness preserved in vermilion and azure.\nThe jade countenance of the perfected,\nHis fragrant legacy unceasing.”\n\nAnother eulogy reads:\n“Remote was the true immortal,\nSolitary in lofty integrity.\nHis qi pierced the vault of heaven;\nThe Mysterious Origin revealed its secrets.\nHis divine bearing, resplendent,\nStood like the bright moon aloft.\nHe executed the perverse, severed the demonic,\nDrove away specters, banished ghosts.\nIn the Han, he established the Alliance of Might,\nIts transmission unbroken to this day.”\n\nEmperor Suzong of the Tang composed this eulogy:\n“Virtue arises from purity and emptiness,\nThe essence of the sagely teachings.\nNow hidden, now manifest,\nSimple and unadorned.\nAbiding in jade towers,\nBurning incense in chambers of jade,\nHis Dao-heart unwavering—\nThis is the Orthodox Unity.”\n\nEmperor Huizong of the Song issued a jade register for the Perfected Lord, stating:\n“In the second year of Daguan, the cyclical year *wuzǐ*, on the sixteenth day of the tenth month, *rénchén*, the Emperor, with reverence, proclaims:\nThe Dao is without limit,\nYet relies on humanity to be enacted.\nWhen actions are enslaved by things,\nThey depend on people to be fulfilled.\nOf old, the utmost perfected ones\nEmployed the Dao to transform the age,\nTheir merit pervading all things,\nThus becoming divine and luminous.\nHow could one not revere and honor\nSuch surpassing excellence?\nThe Orthodox Unity Perfected Man, Great Dharma Master of the Three Heavens Who Upholds the Teachings and Assists the Primordial, embodied the wondrous and expounded the mysterious, bringing great benefit to the world. In the latter days of the Liu dynasty, his deeds flourished. Thereafter, he harnessed radiance and light, transcending the mortal realm. The True Chart of Autumn Threads was transmitted to posterity, eradicating calamities and misfortunes, warding off inauspicious omens. In obscurity, he aided the common people, his fame enduring and ever more illustrious. Without a fitting title, how could his recompense be complete? Thus, we bestow this honor to extol his virtuous grace.\n\nWith reverence, we dispatch the *Chaofeng Dafu* and Prefect of Xinzhou, Liu Yan, to confer the honorific title: *Perfected Lord of Orthodox Unity Who Pacifies and Responds*.\nThe Dao, though hidden in mystery,\nIs manifest in clarity.\nIts merit swiftly bestowed,\nIts glory near at hand.\nThis is not of our own doing,\nBut through constancy unceasing.\nMay you observe this,\nAnd further practice its residue,\nBlessing our state and household,\nExtending to our people,\nThat boundless prosperity may flourish,\nAnd endure for generations unending.”\n\nEmperor Lizong of the Song issued this decree:\n“The Daoist school takes purity, stillness, and non-action as its foundation. Talismanic registers, cinnabar elixirs, breath cultivation, and ritual offerings are its ancestral methods. That its adherents are deeply devoted is no wonder, for it guides people to repent their transgressions and incline toward goodness—is this not an aid to the teachings of names and the governance of the Dao?\nThe Great Dharma Master of the Three Heavens Who Upholds the Teachings and Assists the Primordial, Perfected Lord of Orthodox Unity Who Pacifies and Responds, received his mandate from the celestial realms and was born in the Han dynasty. Cultivating truth and refining conduct, he ascended on clouds. The Twenty-Four Treatments, his vow on Qingcheng to subdue demons with a brush, the transformation of three ants into a salt spring—these numinous traces in Shu cannot be denied. Shangrao’s Dragon-Tiger Mountain is said to be his former abode, where the jade seal and sacred sword have been transmitted through generations. Recently, when the capital suffered drought and tidal surges, earnest prayers brought swift response, truly a manifestation of hidden blessings. Yet some scholars, clinging to ancient histories, dismiss these wonders with scorn, unaware that the constant goodness of saving people leaves none abandoned. Is this not akin to the heart of compassion, the wellspring of benevolence? Following his former titles, we now add a laudatory epithet, that all may reverently uphold his legacy. Let him be honored as the Great Dharma Master of the Three Heavens Who Upholds the Teachings, Assists the Primordial, and Manifests Blessings, Perfected Lord of Orthodox Unity.”\n\nEmperor Chengzong of the Yuan issued this decree:\n“Our dynasty, with utmost benevolence and supreme virtue, has never forgotten the legacy and numinous influence of the Ancestral Heavenly Master. As recorded in the annals, upon examining ancient precedents, we now bestow an additional honorific: Great Dharma Master of the Three Heavens Who Upholds the Teachings, Assists the Primordial, and Pacifies Responses, Perfected Lord Who Manifests Blessings.\nRefining qi to attain perfection,\nDispelling evil and aiding the upright,\nHe has been a model for the world\nFor over twelve hundred years.\nThe seal and sword, transmitted through a single line,\nNow rest with the thirty-seventh generation.\nHis descendants, like branches of a tree,\nHave faithfully upheld the true Dharma.\nMaster Zong Liusun has enriched the ancestral enterprise.\nThough the Dao originates in non-action,\nNo virtue is greater than honoring what is distant.”",

He established the office of *jijiu*, and those who recovered and could follow the rules were made to wear scripture cords, leading them toward goodness until, in time, they transformed themselves. At the time, he was appointed by imperial decree as Colonel Director of Agriculture, General Who Pacifies the People, and Prefect of Hanzhong. When Liu Bei conquered Shu, harboring ambitions of disloyalty, he requested the Heavenly Master to serve as Supervisor of Righteousness and Marshal. Thereupon, the master withdrew to Hanzhong, amassing vast stores of grain. The court then appointed him Governor of Hanzhong and Nanzheng. Before long, the armies of Qin and Yong revolted, plotting to enthrone the Heavenly Master as king of Hanzhong, but he firmly resisted. Soon after, the forces of Wei pressed upon him, so he sealed the treasuries and retired to the Southern Mountains. When Cao Cao led his troops into Nanzheng and saw the well-stocked treasuries, recognizing no ill intent, he greatly admired him. With humble words, he sent envoys to console and instruct, appointing him Inspector of Liang and Yi Provinces, granting the title General Who Guards the South, Marquis Within the Passes, with a fief of thirty thousand households. The master firmly declined, saying to the envoy: “I am a cultivator of the Dao, and my generation aspires to transcendence. The enfeoffment of lands is not my desire.” He requested the return of the seals and ribbons. One day, he summoned his heir, Sheng, and entrusted him with the scripture cords, sword, and seals, saying: “At Dragon-Tiger Mountain lies the ancestral altar of the Perfected.

Carrying the sword, seal, scriptures, and registers, he returned from Hanzhong to Poyang, then entered Longhu Mountain, where he discovered the former altar site of the Ancestral Celestial Master and the ancient cinnabar terrace. He settled there and, on the Three Primordial Days, personally ascended the altar to transmit the registers, bestowing them upon disciples from all directions. Those who came to study the Dao numbered over a thousand. From this time onward, he established ritual protocols, making them the standard practice. He entrusted the sword and seal to his son, Zhaocheng, thereby manifesting the transformative power of his teachings. Before his years were fulfilled, he again traveled to Hezhou in Guangxi to perform rituals for the Prince of Guang. To others, he remarked: “From the Crane Cry Mountains of western Shu to the Dragon-Tiger Mountains of eastern Wu, my meritorious practice now complete, I journey once more through the southern lands.” In the first year of the Zhizheng era of the Yuan dynasty, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Luminous Teachings and Vast Virtue of the Qingwei Tradition.\n\nThe fifth-generation Celestial Master, named Zhaocheng and styled Daorong, was the eldest son of Yuanzong. From youth, he pursued the Dao with unwavering diligence. Often seated in meditation within a chamber, his spirit would wander hundreds of *li* afar, and tigers and leopards that encountered him would crouch in submission. He lived to the age of one hundred and nineteen before transforming, his complexion remaining as though alive. A hundred stalks of *lingzhi* mushrooms sprouted at his grave, and some witnessed white cranes coming and going. When his coffin was later opened, only his cap and shoes remained. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era of the Yuan dynasty, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Vast Teachings and Illuminating Dao of the Qingwei Tradition.\n\nThe sixth-generation Celestial Master, named Shu and styled Dexin, was broadly versed in Confucian texts. Emperor An repeatedly summoned him, but he declined to serve. Once, while traveling on Poyang Lake, on a moonlit night, an elderly man boarded his boat and addressed him: “I have heard that your esteemed lineage has established its teachings upon the immortal Dao, and I long to pay homage, yet I have no means to approach. Tonight, by unexpected fortune, your transcendent presence has graced these shores, and I am blessed to behold your radiant countenance. I humbly beseech you to reveal the profound mysteries and dispel my ignorance.” The Celestial Master replied: “In ancient times, those who attained the Dao all entered through the gateway of precepts. Yet to lodge the mind in the precepts is not as profound as lodging the precepts in the mind. When the myriad dharmas are all empty, the One True Nature abides eternally. Do you comprehend this?” The old man rose, expressed his gratitude, and departed. Some of the Celestial Master’s followers witnessed a strange light, the water and sky merging as one, unaware of where the old man had gone. The Celestial Master smiled and said: “This was the Dragon Elder, who governs the aquatic tribes. Having never heard the Great Dao, he came to make this request.” While residing on the mountain, he manifested many numinous signs. Having lived over a hundred years, he departed through *shijie*. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era of the Yuan dynasty, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Mysterious Wonder and Vast Teachings of the Qingwei Tradition.\n\nThe seventh-generation Celestial Master, named Hui and styled Zhongchang, as soon as he could speak, asked what the Dao was. When none could answer, he sighed with a rueful smile. At the age of five, he wished to receive the scriptures and registers, but his father said: “First study the Confucian texts.” He replied: “If I do not study the ancestral texts, what use is there in reading others?” At ten, he succeeded the teachings. He was able to abstain from grain and could travel hundreds of *li* in a day. Later, he entered Mount Qingcheng and vanished without a trace. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era of the Yuan dynasty, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Assisting Teachings and Vast Salvation of the Yuqing Tradition.\n\nThe eighth-generation Celestial Master, named Jiong and styled Yanchao, from childhood attained the Dao.

      "translated_text": "Emperor Taizu of Wei once summoned him to the imperial court to inquire about the Dao. At ninety years of age, on the day of his transformation, an extraordinary fragrance filled the chamber and lingered for a month without dissipating. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era of the Yuan dynasty, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Responding Transformation and Tranquil Emptiness of the Yuqing Tradition.\n\nThe ninth-generation Celestial Master, named Fu and styled Dexin, was solemn, upright, and perspicacious. Whatever Confucian classics, histories, or ancestral texts he perused, he could recite from memory after a single reading. His scriptures and registers were renowned in his time, and he was revered throughout the land. He transformed at the age of ninety-three. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Assisting Transformation and Lofty Mystery of the Yuqing Tradition.\n\nThe tenth-generation Celestial Master, named Zixiang and styled Linbo, served the Sui dynasty as a magistrate in Luoyang. He resigned his post to succeed the teachings, refining his diet and inner alchemy. He could exhale cinnabar, place it in his palm, and its radiance would shine beyond the door; soon after, he would swallow it again. Once, while traveling through the Yellow River and Luo River regions, he ascended the central peak of Mount Song and lodged in a stone chamber, delighting in its seclusion. One night, he suddenly heard the sound of soldiers and horses. Two divine officials, passing through on their way to pay respects to the Lord of the Eastern Marchmount, sought an audience with the Celestial Master. The Lord said: “I once met the Sagely Master at Mount Qingcheng, and now over four hundred years have passed. Since the Wei and Jin dynasties, the land has long been ravaged by chaos, and the people have suffered, their karmic debts entangled without hope of liberation. Now, by fortune, the Marchmount’s administration has encountered the Sagely Master again. I humbly beseech you to widely propagate the registers and talismans, that they may aid in deliverance.” With these words, they took their leave. The Celestial Master returned to the mountain and dispatched his disciples to propagate the teachings in all directions, accumulating merit in the mysterious work. He transformed at the age of one hundred and twenty. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Supreme Mystery and Great Emptiness of the Shangqing Tradition.\n\nThe eleventh-generation Celestial Master, named Tongxuan and styled Zhongda, was by nature tranquil and reticent. He often sat alone in a chamber and would not emerge except at the proper time; even his attendants seldom saw him. During a great epidemic, he planted a staff in water, and all who drew and drank from it were cured. When people brought silk in gratitude, he declined, saying: “My ancestors aided others—how could I accept thanks?” Those seeking talismans gathered in throngs, and those receiving scriptures and registers grew ever more numerous. He transformed at the age of ninety-seven. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Mysterious Response and Harmonious Emptiness of the Shangqing Tradition.\n\nThe twelfth-generation Celestial Master, named Heng and styled Derun, could peruse classics and histories without ever forgetting them. Emperor Gaozong of Tang dispatched an emissary to summon him and inquired about the Dao of governing the state and pacifying the people.",

When he opened the jar at night, all its contents were found intact within the porcelain vessel, remaining unspoiled for days. He transformed at the age of ninety-eight.

In transmitting scriptures and registers, he ordinarily ate only vegetables, later mastering the art of grain avoidance. He transformed at the age of one hundred and four. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Supreme Mystery, Utmost Virtue, and Vast Wonder.\n\nHis youngest son, named Wu and styled Junming, cultivated the Dao from childhood.

      "translated_text": "Each year on the Three Yuan Days, he would emerge from the mountains to transmit the scriptures and registers. The imperial court repeatedly summoned him, but he never responded. Over a hundred years later, he transformed, and celestial music was heard descending from the void to welcome him. Today, Shengjing Mountain is called Master Summoned-by-the-Court Mountain, and the stream is called Master Summoned-by-the-Court Gully. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era of the Yuan dynasty, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Supreme Mystery, Upper Virtue, and Purple Void.\n\nThe fifteenth-generation Celestial Master, named Gao and styled Shilong, possessed a bearing of transcendent spaciousness. Fond of wine, he could drink a *dan* without becoming drunk. Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang summoned him for an audience and commanded him to establish an altar in the capital to transmit the registers, bestowing upon him gold and silk, exempting him from taxes, and conferring the title of Celestial Master of the Han Ancestor. Emperor Suzong sent incense and silk, held a grand jiao ritual in the mountains, and presented an imperial calligraphic inscription to eulogize the Celestial Master’s portrait. Once, he left his jade seal in a Chang’an wineshop, and though a young man tried to lift it with all his strength, he could not move it. The next day, the Celestial Master arrived, laughed, and carried it away. He transformed at the age of ninety-three. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Supreme Mystery, Revered Virtue, and Mysterious Transformation.\n\nThe sixteenth-generation Celestial Master, named Yingzhao and styled Zhifeng, after inheriting the teaching, entrusted his son with the sword and seal and retired to the southern mountains above Dragon Beard Well, where he tilled the land for his own delight. Often, he would sit on a rock by the well and play an iron flute, its sound carrying for miles. One day, he suspended himself over the deep well, sat upright, and transformed. He was buried beside the well. Today, there remains the Immortal’s Tomb, with a stone gate framed by intertwined trees. The land he cultivated is called Yellow Sand Gully. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Cavernous Void, Evolving Dao, and Pure Simplicity.\n\nThe seventeenth-generation Celestial Master, named Shun and styled Zhongfu, was supremely filial. When his mother fell ill for ten days, he did not remove his sash for a month. He often said to others: “Those who are neither loyal nor filial yet seek to study the Dao and aspire to immortality are like abandoning their oars and crossing a great river.” Initially serving as the magistrate of Guishui, he resigned his post to inherit the teaching, bringing his wife and children to dwell in a thatched hut in the mountains. He transformed at the age of eighty-seven. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Cavernous Void, Propagating the Teaching, and Faithfully Protective.\n\nThe eighteenth-generation Celestial Master, named Shiyuan and styled Zhongliang, was gaunt and heavily bearded. He dwelled on Yingtian Mountain for forty years. The mountain was home to many tigers, and no one dared to visit him. Only on the Three Yuan Days would he descend the mountain to transmit the registers. During great winds and rains, he was sometimes seen wearing a dark cap, riding a black tiger as he traversed the peaks—those who witnessed this knew him to be the Celestial Master. Today, to the south of the mountain stands the Cinnabar Hut, and to the north lie the Scripture-Translating Stone, Black Dragon Well, and Azure Lotus Pond, all his vestiges. He transformed at the age of ninety-two. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Cavernous Void, Illuminating the Dao, and Assisting the Turning of the Kalpa.\n\nThe nineteenth-generation Celestial Master, named Xiu and styled Dezhen, was of simple and unadorned nature, tilling the fields himself. When those afflicted with illness came to him, he would inscribe talismans on leaves to treat them, and they would immediately recover. Whenever he transmitted registers to those who had attained them, he would distribute them freely to others. A wealthy merchant from Jiangxi named Liu Qian once received registers from him. One day, Liu died in Jinling but revived two days later. He recounted being seized by the underworld authorities and encountering a divine official on the road, who said: “Since you have long received the registers, though your death is due, you may extend your life by two cycles.” Thereupon, Liu entered the mountains and became a disciple. One day, the Celestial Master gathered his disciples and said: “I shall transform on such-and-such a day.” When the day arrived, he bathed, changed his clothes, sat upright, and transformed. He was eighty-five years old. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era, he was posthumously honored as Perfected Lord of Mysterious Void, Resplendent Transformation, and Illustrious Blessing.\n\nThe twentieth-generation Celestial Master, named Chen and styled Zijian, was summoned by Emperor Wuzong of the Tang during the Xinyou year of the Huichang era. The emperor bestowed upon him the plaque “True Immortal Abbey” for the altar where he transmitted the registers. When the court sought to appoint him to an official post, he declined and returned home. During the Xiantong era, Emperor Yizong commanded the construction of a grand Golden Register jiao ritual, bestowed gold ingots, and allowed him to return to the mountains.",

Often carrying a sword through mountains and marshes, he once shouted at an ancient tree, and thunder immediately split it asunder, striking dead two giant pythons and over a hundred smaller serpents. The Prince of Qi of Southern Tang dreamed he had fallen into a well, from which a Daoist with emerald eyes and a long beard, clad in crimson robes, lifted him out. Diviners declared, \"This is the Han Celestial Master.\" Thereupon, the prince journeyed to Mount Longhu, built a shrine, and bestowed water fields. When the Celestial Master was about to transform, he said, \"I depart now—soon the earth will quake.\" After his passing, the ground indeed trembled, and he was not encoffined until seven days later.

He responded, \"This is the work of rustics, not a pursuit befitting a sovereign. Your Majesty’s practice of clarity and non-action is already the equal of Yao and Shun.\" The emperor was delighted.

I have called upon you to remedy this.\" The command was issued, and he immediately inscribed an iron talisman, ordering his disciple Zhu Yongyou, along with an eunuch, to cast it into the collapsed bank of the pond. In an instant, thunder and lightning darkened the day, and a flood dragon and a giant crab were struck dead at the water’s edge.\n\nThe emperor asked, \"When you previously subdued the flood dragon, what method did you use? Can it be summoned again?\" He replied, \"The one I command is Guan Yu. He may be called forth.\" Grasping his sword, he summoned Guan Yu to the left of the hall, and Guan appeared. The emperor, startled, tossed a *Chongning* coin to him, saying, \"Use this as your seal.\" Henceforth, Guan Yu was worshipped as *Chongning Zhenjun* (True Lord of Prosperous Peace).\n\nThe following year, in the third month, he reported that the salt tax had returned to normal. In the fifth month, he was summoned, granted a seat, and asked about the similarities and differences in Daoist methods. He replied, \"The Dao is fundamentally non-action, yet nothing is left undone. Its essence is the Dao itself, and its function is the method. Essence and function share a single source—there is no inherent difference. If one does not establish unity, then two are merely forced distinctions. Where, then, is there any difference?\" The emperor said, \"Indeed, if there were differences, then speech itself would become a third thing.\"\n\nThereupon, he presented the *Heavenly Heart Methods for Dispelling Calamities*, including the Thunder Rites, which the emperor personally performed. In the seventh month, he established an altar to transmit scriptures and registers, expounding on the wonders of the Dao and its methods. Those who came to pay their respects gathered in great numbers, all departing with deep understanding.\n\nThe emperor, seated in the Hall of Celestial Auspices, casually inquired about both Daoist matters and state governance. He replied, \"The ministers of the Yuanyou era all bear the weight of the realm’s expectations. I humbly beseech Your Majesty to show them leniency.\" The emperor, startled, said, \"What is there that I would not tolerate?\" He replied, \"Your Majesty has grandly established the imperial standard, remaining impartial and without faction, ever mindful of the people under Heaven. This is most fortunate.\" He earnestly requested to return to the mountains. The emperor praised him, granted his leave, and offered gold and silk, all of which he declined. The emperor ordered his ministers to prepare a farewell banquet at the capital’s gate.\n\nIn the fourth year, he was summoned again to perform a ritual in the inner court. There, he secretly reported the omens of the \"Red Horse and Scarlet Ram\" and urged the cultivation of virtue. Emperor Huizong of Song issued an edict: \"Zhang Jixian, the thirty-first-generation descendant of the Han Celestial Master, has inherited the profound merits of his ancestor. As his descendant, you have not neglected the distant legacy, carrying on the ancestral methods. Your efficacy with talismanic water is renowned, and your virtue is serene and harmonious. Your Dao is lofty and pure. It is fitting to bestow honors to illuminate the true wind. You are granted the title *Master of Serene Repose* and presented with golden statues of Laozi and the Han Celestial Master.\"\n\nRepeatedly requesting to return, he was not permitted. The emperor asked what he desired, and he replied, \"What I desire is this: the Upper Clarity Abbey is dilapidated and remote. The community wishes to relocate and rebuild it, but our strength is insufficient.\" The emperor ordered the Jiangdong transport commissioner to survey the mountain, select a site, and oversee the relocation and reconstruction, granting fields to sustain the community. He also established a hermitage to the north of the mountain as a place for the Celestial Master’s cultivation, bestowing upon it the imperial inscription *Jingtong Hermitage*. A pavilion named *Xiuran* was built, along with three abbeys—*Lingbao*, *Yunjin*, and *Zhenyi*—while the ancestral shrine was transformed into the *Yanfa Abbey*. Jade tablets were presented, and the ancestral master’s title was elevated, with posthumous enfeoffment as a True Lord.\n\nIn the twelfth month, he returned to the mountain. All his father’s and elder brothers’ ranks were conferred with distinctions. Scholars from all directions, numbering in the thousands, flocked to him. In the *dinghai* year of the Daguan era, the emperor dispatched an envoy to command a ritual on the mountain and summoned him to court. At the time, Master Xu shared his lodgings. Soon after, Master Xu remarked, \"Worldly affairs are fleeting. Would it not be better to retire?\" He replied, \"To return is simply to return. What need is there for thought or worry?\" Master Xu suddenly sat upright and passed away.\n\nOn the fifth day of the fifth month, he was summoned to the palace. The emperor said, \"There appears to be a malevolent presence. You must dispel it.\" He replied, \"When evil is heard of, it does not disturb the upright. Malevolence cannot overcome virtue. If Your Majesty cultivates virtue, the malevolence will naturally cease.\" An attendant reported that a malevolent spirit had indeed appeared at the *Renji Pavilion*. Moments later, the spirit possessed a young man, who clutched his head, weeping and bowing. The Celestial Master said, \"Your heart has obscured itself, leading you astray. Return to your original form. You should swiftly depart.\" The young man ceased weeping, collapsed to the ground for some time, and then revived.",

When the True Governor is obscured and the faculties of perception blaze unchecked, the solitary radiance of the One True [Dao] alone shines forth, while all else across ten thousand kalpas is void—thus even Heaven has nothing to preserve.\"\n\nShi Zifang gained insight.\n\nIn the second year of Zhenghe, envoys were again dispatched to summon him, but he declined on grounds of illness. He sent his disciple Wang Daojian to offer thanks, declaring his intent to cultivate virtue and avert calamity. Later, the *shangqing* abbey was elevated to a palace, and Daojian was appointed Grand Master of the Supreme Simplicity, charged with overseeing the Registers of the Hall of Concentrated Spirit. Commanded to perform rites to dispel the nation’s perils, he then returned to Xujiang.\n\nWang Wenqing, renowned at court for his arts alongside [the Celestial Master], also retired to the mountains. They often visited one another, passing days in carefree ease and contentment. At times, amid wind-swept dawns or moonlit evenings, they explored secluded and perilous places, wandering and chanting verses, each finding his own joy.\n\nOne day, [the Celestial Master] inscribed the wall of the *Turan* Pavilion:\n\n*\"The Crimson Emperor rides his dragon, yet his course remains unmastered;\nChang’e divides the moon to enter the depths of Mount Tan.\"*\n\nNone could fathom its meaning.\n\nOnce, while traveling to Magu, he rested at the Pavilion of Clouds Aligned and sighed, \"The steps to Penglai are now shallow—has the mulberry field grown clear?\"\n\nHis words were borne out by the calamity of Jingkang.\n\nIn the *bingwu* year, as the Jin invaded Bianjing, the Emperor and the Retired Emperor recalled the Celestial Master’s earlier memorials and urgently dispatched envoys to summon him.

      "translated_text": "The late Celestial Master’s kinsman, Martial Grandee Zhang Xian, arrived and led the local gentry and commoners in interring him beneath Tortoise Mountain.\n\nEarlier, while the Celestial Master was in the capital, the Imperial Academy student Chen Shu had asked Yi Guan about his life’s end. The Celestial Master replied: “Chen Shu shall be a loyal minister, his name enduring without decay. Yi Guan shall serve as a county magistrate and die in old age.” Later, after Emperor Gaozong crossed south, Chen Shu memorialized the throne, petitioning for the dismissal of Huang Qianshan and Wang Boyan, and was executed for it. Yi Guan, as magistrate of Taihe, lived in poverty and died at the year’s end.\n\nSixteen years after the Celestial Master’s transformation, in the *xinyou* year of Shaoxing, the Western River adept Sa Shoujian traveled to Qingcheng and encountered him at the Gorge’s mouth. There, he was bestowed talismanic methods, a *Shuidiao* song lyric, a sealed letter, and a single shoe, with instructions to deliver them to the succeeding Celestial Master. Upon reaching the mountain, the successor opened the letter and marveled at its contents. Dispatching a messenger to verify at Sizhou, they found only one shoe remaining—thus confirming his liberation through the corpse.\n\nLater sightings of him were also reported at Mount Wuyi and Luofu.\n\nEmperor Wuzong of the Yuan issued an edict, proclaiming: “We reflect that Guangchengzi, dwelling on Kongtong, discoursed on the wondrous union of form and spirit; that Tang’s Sang Chu, residing in Weilei, was honored with the rites of ancestral sacrifice. Through generations, the true wind has flourished, and it is fitting to bestow a venerable title in this illustrious age. The thirty-first successor of the Han, the Celestial Master Xu Jing, immersed himself in profound stillness, his nature pure and harmonious. The Dao gathers in emptiness, and through it he awakened to the Mystery; his conduct in the mundane was serene and steadfast. Once, in response to the Song sovereign’s leisurely inquiry, he expounded at length on the Laozi’s principle of purity and quiescence. The spirit attains numinosity through the One—thus his prayers and invocations were ever efficacious. All things return to their root in stillness, for therein abides the enduring refinement of essence and qi. Therefore, We enhance his celestial rank and confer an exalted name upon his ancestral register. Though the feathered transcendent bathes in the Yang Valley, We do not merely long for his lofty traces—riding the white clouds, he returns to his homeland, yet still upholds the mandate of his forebears.” He was thus enfeoffed as *Xu Jing, the Profoundly Penetrating and Vastly Awakened Perfected Lord*.\n\nThe thirty-second Celestial Master, named Shi Xiu with the courtesy name Chaoying, was the grandson of the twenty-seventh Celestial Master, Xiangzhong, and the son of Dunzhi. Xu Jing never married and had no children. His younger brother, Yuan Zong, became a Daoist priest and was intended to succeed the lineage, his radiance purifying the teachings. However, when Xu Jing traveled to Sizhou, he entrusted his seal, sword, scriptures, and registers to Chaoying. Thus, the assembly urged Chaoying to inherit the tradition. He demurred, saying: “To continue the legacy of my ancestors, I follow my nephew. How could I presume to succeed?” The assembly replied: “The dharma-lineage resides here.” He then assumed the succession.",

He was then summoned to court and bestowed the title Master of Orthodox Response. Emperor Gaozong received him in audience and consulted him on Daoist methods. During the reign of Emperor Xiaozong, when the Yangtze’s torrents surged and breached their banks, he was ordered to perform a jiao ritual in the inner palace.

      "translated_text": "Upon his arrival, he spat water for the prince to drink, and the illness was cured. The prince then sent him off with particularly generous gifts. One day, the prince again dispatched an envoy to extend an invitation. As the envoy approached the gate, Jingyuan suddenly summoned his disciples and said, “My time to ascend as an immortal cannot be delayed.” He then leaned against his desk and passed away, his sword left behind at Shangqing’s Jujia Source. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era of the Yuan dynasty, he was posthumously enfeoffed as the Lofty Perfected of True Emptiness and Primordial Dao, the Perfected Lord of Soaring Dao.\n\nThe Acting Celestial Master, named Sixian with the courtesy name Guangzu, was born in the guisi year of the Qiandao era. His elder brother Jingyuan had once treated him as a son. At nineteen, he inherited the teaching. During the Chongning era, he was summoned to court, where Prince Jingxian bestowed upon him the characters *qiaoyin* (“woodcutter-recluse”). After presiding over the teaching for eleven years, the clan elders deliberated and decided that since Jingyuan had a son, the succession should pass to him. Thus, the seal and sword were handed to his nephew Qingxian, and Sixian retired to cultivate the Dao until the end of his days.\n\nThe thirty-fourth Celestial Master, named Qingxian with the courtesy name Shaozu, was the son of Deying. Before Qingxian’s birth, Deying had raised his younger brother Sixian to temporarily oversee the teaching. Qingxian inherited the teaching in the xinyou year of the Jiatai era. His nature was compassionate and frugal, and he often aided the poor. As a result, the transmission of the scriptural registers flourished under him. He could drink several *dou* of wine without becoming drunk. Once, while traveling to Zhanggong Cave in the mountains, he came upon an extremely deep well. In jest, he tossed a leaf into it. Suddenly, waves surged, and an old man emerged from the well, bowed, and made a request before warning him not to dredge the well in times of drought and then departing. On the twenty-second day of the tenth month in the second year of the Jiading era, a Daoist arrived for an audience, treating him with great reverence. After the visitor left, Qingxian told his disciples, “He and I share a deep pact.” Seven days later, he rose at dawn, sat in meditation, and passed away. In the thirteenth year of the Zhizheng era of the Yuan dynasty, he was posthumously enfeoffed as the Faithful, Unyielding, True, Wondrous, Radiant, and Transformative Perfected Lord.\n\nThe thirty-fifth Celestial Master, named Keda with the courtesy name Zixian, was the grandson of the second son of the thirty-second Celestial Master Shouzhen, named Boshan. Earlier, when Jingyuan had passed away, Bolin had temporarily overseen the teaching. After Qingxian’s death, his legitimate son Chengda was still young, so Keda’s father, Tianlin, temporarily managed the teaching. Emperor Ningzong summoned him and bestowed the title Master of Benevolent Stillness. Shortly afterward, Chengda died young, and Keda was named Qingxian’s successor. In the third year of the Shaoding era, after the death of Master of Benevolent Stillness, Keda, at the age of twelve, formally assumed the position of the thirty-fifth Celestial Master. At the time, the waters of Poyang Lake overflowed, destroying the homes of the people. Prefect Yuan Fu requested his aid, and Keda cast a talisman into the river. Thunder struck, killing a great white serpent, and the waters receded. Yuan Fu then composed a poem in his honor. During the Duanping era, he was repeatedly summoned to court and granted scriptures and funds. In the third year of the Jiaxi era, the tide at Qiantang surged, flooding the area up to the Gen Mountain Gate and submerging all the people’s homes. The emperor issued an edict for him to address it. He cast an iron talisman into the depths, and the tide receded. Later, during a great drought and locust plague, he was ordered to perform a jiao ritual at the Taiyi Palace. Rain fell, and the locusts choked. In the seventh month, he was summoned for an audience and granted the title Master of Mysterious Observation. He was also appointed to oversee the registers of the Three Mountains, concurrently managing affairs of the imperial Daoist institutions, and placed in charge of the Longxiang Palace. He rebuilt the Zhenyi Abbey, was granted several hundred *qing* of land, and exempted from taxes. The emperor personally inscribed the names *Zhenfeng Hall*, *Purple Tenuity Pavilion*, and *Zhenyi Abbey*. He also bestowed posthumous titles upon the ancestral masters, the Two Generals Guan and Shi, and the deities of Longjing and others. Emperor Shizu of the Yuan dynasty sent an envoy to inquire of him, and he presented the *Lingquan* scripture, foretelling that his descendants would be heeded. In the fourth month of the fourth year of the Jingding era, he handed the seal and sword to his second son, Zongyan, submitted a memorial in resignation, and passed away. The chancellor Jiang Wanli composed an inscription, and his sword was interred at the Ruiqing Abbey. Emperor Shizu of the Yuan issued an edict stating:\n\n“The Dao is the eternal principle of Heaven and Earth, and those who subtly participate in creation and bear its name are the shared treasure of past and present. Thus, We bestow special honors. The thirty-fifth successor of the Han Celestial Master, Master of Mysterious Observation Zhang Keda, bore the registers of the Three Mysteries and his fame resounded to the eight directions. Through accumulated merit and virtuous conduct, he attained the subtle and profound. His prayers for rain and the receding of tides were particularly efficacious. Formerly, when Our predecessor was still in the princely residence, he dispatched envoys in secret to the Pearl Court. Knowing that the Mandate of Heaven had a destined recipient, he silently transmitted the *Lingquan* scripture, foreseeing that sagely brilliance would unify the Four Seas—this was a sign to be heeded. Twenty years later, as the numinous and the Dao both discerned the future, the distant and the near rejoiced alike, truly fulfilling the words of old. Now, cherishing the true and the transcendent, We bestow extraordinary favor. The successor master and his younger brother, steadfastly upholding the ancestral teachings, join Master Liushun in presiding over the mysteries of the Dao. Thus, We establish the sacrifices of Jiqiu and add the title *True Unity*. Alas! The regalia of office are not the aspirations of the perfected, and the clouds and carriages of proximity still await the unfolding of what has yet to be realized.”\n\nHe was posthumously enfeoffed as the Perfected Lord of Penetrating Mystery, Responsive Transformation, and Mysterious Observation.\n\nThe thirty-sixth Celestial Master, named Zongyan with the courtesy name Shichuan and the sobriquet Jianqi, was of a profound and tranquil nature. From childhood, he was exceptionally intelligent. At nineteen, he inherited the teaching. During the Xianchun era of the Song dynasty, the prefecture of Shangrao suffered a drought. The prefect, Tang Zhen, requested his aid in praying for rain, and the response came as expected. When Emperor Shizu of the Yuan conquered the Song, he dispatched envoys with generous messages, summoning Zongyan to court. The emperor’s ministers welcomed him at the outskirts with full courtesies. Upon his audience, the emperor questioned him twice. In the sixth month, he performed a jiao ritual in the inner palace.",

The emperor bestowed upon him the title \"Zhenren of Dao-Pervading, Spirit-Responsive, Harmonious Emptiness\" and granted him a silver seal of the second rank, commanding him to oversee Daoist affairs in the Jiangnan region. He was authorized to issue ordination certificates for those entering the Daoist path, and to establish Daoist Registries along major routes, Daoist Rectifiers in prefectures, and Masters of Ritual Decorum in counties, all under his jurisdiction. An imperial edict exempted Daoist temples in Jiangnan from taxes and corvée labor. In the capital, Chongzhen Wanshou Palace was constructed, with his disciple Zhang Liusun appointed to preside over it.\n\nLater, he was summoned to court twice more, each time receiving even greater honors. One day, a Daoist monk visited and spoke of a \"jade hare’s covenant.\" On the eleventh day of the eleventh month in the Xinyou year of the Zhiyuan era, a white hare was presented. He said to his disciples, \"I was born at dawn yesterday; today, I depart at dawn tomorrow.\" He then wrote a hymn and transformed, his sword buried at Xietianyuan. Posthumously, he was honored as \"Zhenren of Dao-Pervading, Spirit-Responsive, Harmonious Emptiness, and Mysterious Tranquility.\"\n\nEmperor Shizu of the Yuan issued an edict:\n*\"To the Celestial Master of Longhu Mountain, Zhang:*\nYour ancestor, Dao-Ling, cultivated single-minded devotion and received the orthodox transmission of the Daoist register, its efficacy widely attested and its teachings disseminated to this day. Your lineage has endured for over thirty-six generations across more than two thousand years. Though I have long heard of your renown, the estrangement between our realms prevented me from extending an invitation. Recently, the Song ruler, failing to measure his virtue or strength, detained my envoys and refused to release them. Thus, I commanded my Left Chancellor, Bo Yan, to lead troops south. By the grace of Heaven, the Great River now lies within our domain, and North and South are united as one family. I now dispatch Generals Wang Shiying and Xiao Yu, bearing this edict to summon you. Do not harbor doubts due to the change of rule. Your ancestors, since the Eastern Han, have served fifteen dynasties with impartiality, never swayed by bias. Heaven is without partiality, and its mandate is not constant. As one who understands the Dao, how could you be confused on this point? Hasten to answer the call; do not decline excessively. Let this edict be known to you. Respect this decree.\"*\n\nEmperor Shizu of the Yuan issued a proclamation:\n*\"The thirty-sixth Celestial Master, Zhang Zongyan:*\nYou have inherited the transmission of the Dao and embodied the pure essence of its teachings. You have propagated the great rituals of the Yellow Court and Supreme Cavern, upheld the Orthodox Unity register of numinous might, purified and refined through sincerity and faith. With a three-foot green serpent, you command spirits in the unseen realms; with a ladle of bright water, you dispel calamities near and far. Having rendered great service in salvation and governance, you are fittingly granted this honorific title. Thus, you are bestowed the title 'Zhenren of Dao-Pervading, Spirit-Responsive, Harmonious Emptiness.'\"*\n\nEmperor Chengzong of the Yuan issued a proclamation:\n*\"Since ancient times, the enlightened have often dwelled in renowned mountains, their conduct guided by the times. The thirty-sixth Celestial Master, 'Zhenren of Dao-Pervading, Spirit-Responsive, Harmonious Emptiness,' oversees Daoist affairs across the Jiangnan region. Zhang Zongyan inherited the lineage of immortals, delving into the practice of tranquil concentration. When the imperial army first arrived at Ezhu, his wondrous Dao reached the ears of the Emperor. Edicts bearing vermilion seals, cloud-script, and phoenix-calligraphy descended upon Jiangnan. He was honored with golden robes, jade crowns, and a crane-drawn carriage, thrice summoned to the sacred presence. The ancestral teachings flourished anew, and the mysteries of the Dao shone brighter. Though his immortal journey is distant, we extend our compassionate rites. Thus, we elevate his title and bestow further grace. Alas! Like the Yang of Jingyang who subdued the flood dragon, his virtuous legacy endures in his descendants. May his abode be free of pestilence, and his blessings extend to the people. He is posthumously honored as 'Zhenren of Dao-Pervading, Spirit-Responsive, Harmonious Emptiness, and Mysterious Tranquility.'\"*\n\nThe thirty-seventh Celestial Master, named Yudi with the courtesy name Guohua and the sobriquet Xizi, was of a profound and silent nature. He mastered the Three Teachings and composed poetry and prose effortlessly, producing thousands of words. At twenty, he accompanied his father to court. His demeanor was refined and luminous, his responses quick and apt, drawing repeated admiration from the emperor. In the Xinyou year of the Zhiyuan era, he inherited the teaching. Upon his summons, the emperor granted him a seat and offered profound comfort, appointing him \"Zhenren of the Body-Mystery, Dao-Broadening, Teaching-Expanding\" and entrusting him with oversight of Daoist affairs in the Jiangnan region.\n\nWhen Emperor Chengzong ascended the throne, he was summoned again. He performed jiao rituals in the Round Hall and Changchun Palace, and the emperor commanded that his ritual texts be practiced throughout the realm. All Tianqing Temples across the empire were renamed Xuanmiao Temples. One day, he suddenly told his disciples, \"I have always held worldly tastes in little regard. Remaining in the capital for so long is not my wish.\" He earnestly requested to return to the mountains, but his plea was not granted. A month later, he transformed at Chongzhen Palace. His coffin was escorted back to the mountains, and court ministers held a memorial service at the capital’s gates. He was later buried at Yutian.\n\nEmperor Shizu of the Yuan issued a proclamation:\n*\"Zhang Yudi, the thirty-seventh-generation descendant of the Han Celestial Master, shall succeed his father as 'Zhenren of Dao-Pervading, Spirit-Responsive, Harmonious Emptiness,' inheriting the transmission of the Dao and propagating its mysteries. Let Zhang Yudi act accordingly.\"*\n\nEmperor Shizu of the Yuan issued another proclamation:\n*\"Zhang Yudi, the thirty-seventh-generation descendant of the Han Celestial Master:*\nYour lineage is blessed, and your transformations are boundless. We fittingly bestow the honor of a purple decree to serve as a model for the Daoist gate. Thus, you are granted the title 'Zhenren of the Body-Mystery, Dao-Broadening, Teaching-Expanding,' and entrusted with oversight of Daoist affairs in the Jiangnan region.\"*\n\nEmperor Wuzong of the Yuan issued a proclamation:\n*\"Inheriting the Daoist teachings and continuing the ancestral path, you extend your virtue within and dispense grace without, aligning with the present era’s aspirations. The thirty-seventh Celestial Master of the Han lineage, the Immortal Maiden Feng Shuzhen, traces her noble lineage to ancient times. Her virtuous bearing rivals the transmission of Gu Cheng, and her adherence to purity and tranquility surpasses the resolve of Wu Zhou. Her steadfast integrity has earned her blessings, and her exploration of the Dao has brought her renown. This convergence of dragon and tiger, phoenix and cloud is a rare fortune. Thus, we honor her with a decree befitting the dancing phoenix and returning simurgh. Inheriting the flourishing teachings, she is appointed 'Immortal Maiden of Pure Brightness and Unadorned Tranquility.'\"*\n\n---",

      "translated_text": "The thirty-eighth Celestial Master, named Yu Cai, styled Guoliang, and known by the sobriquet Guangweizi, was the second son of Zongyan. Endowed with innate benevolence and magnanimity, he composed poetry and prose with effortless mastery, and his calligraphy and letters were exquisite and extraordinary. In the thirty-first year of the Zhiyuan era, he succeeded to the teachings. The emperor dispatched envoys to bestow upon him a ceremonial cap, robes, and jade pendants, commanding him to oversee the affairs of the Daoist teachings and summoning him for an audience. The following year, the era name was changed to Yuanzhen, and he was received in the Daming Hall. In the year thereafter, he was appointed by imperial decree as the \"Perfected of Supreme Simplicity, Spirit-Congealing, and Vast Dao,\" concurrently overseeing Daoist affairs. His mother was also enfeoffed as the \"Immortal Maiden of Mysterious Truth and Wondrous Response,\" empowered to issue ordination certificates to Daoist priests, exempt Daoist temples from corvée labor, protect the registers of the law, and spare them from distant transport duties.\n\nIn the second year of the Dade era, an official from Haiyan reported that the tides in two prefectures had surged, flooding a hundred *li*, with waves nearly breaching the city walls. The Celestial Master was ordered to address the crisis. Upon arriving in Hangzhou, he performed a ritual at the Yousheng Abbey, casting iron talismans into the river’s collapsed banks. Three talismans leapt forth, thunder and lightning darkened the day, and a monstrous fish-headed, turtle-bodied creature over a *zhang* in length was struck dead at the water’s edge. The embankments were restored to their former state.\n\nIn the fifth year, he was summoned again to the capital. The chancellor, Dalahan, requested prayers for rain. The Celestial Master replied, \"Sincerity can reach Heaven, and Heaven will surely respond.\" The following day, rain fell. The emperor inquired, \"The winter has been warm without snow—might the people suffer disaster?\" He commanded the Celestial Master to erect an altar and pray. That very night, snow accumulated to a depth of a *chi*. In the sixth year, he sought leave to return home. The emperor, holding court at Liulin, summoned the Celestial Master to assist in the sacrifices, bestowing lavish praise. He also sealed incense and instructed the Celestial Master to pray at renowned mountains and abbeys along his journey, performing a concluding ritual at the Shangqing Zhengyi Abbey. A silver seal was granted, ranking him as a first-grade official, and he was further honored as Grand Master for Glorious Happiness with Gold and Purple, Duke of Liu, Master of the Orthodox Unity Teachings, and concurrently overseer of the talismanic registers of the Three Mountains. Two preceding generations of hereditary masters and three generations of lineage masters were all enfeoffed as Perfected Lords. His mother, Lady Zhou, was honored as the \"Primordial Sovereign of Mysterious Truth, Wondrous Response, Profound Virtue, and Benevolent Relief.\"\n\nAt the time, the Empress Dowager resided in the Xingsheng Palace, and Prince Renzong in the Eastern Palace, both bestowing upon him exceptional favor. That year, as summer rains persisted, the chief minister, Heshan, acting as regent in the capital, dispatched Minister of Rites Wang Yue to request prayers. Three days later, the skies cleared. Upon Renzong’s ascension, the Celestial Master was again summoned to court and received in the Jiaxi Hall. The Grand Preceptor, Qu Chu, declared by imperial decree: \"I admire the Dao of the Celestial Master, whose lineage of succession is unmatched.\" He was further bestowed with a jeweled crown and golden robes.\n\nIn the second year of the fourth month, an envoy was sent to the mountain with the following edict: \"Last winter, there was no snow, and now there is no rain. The fields cannot be sown, and I am deeply pained by the people’s suffering.\" Prayers were offered at the Shangqing Abbey, and rain promptly fell, nourishing the land far and wide. Each year, those seeking ordination or reporting droughts, floods, or pestilence arrived without cease, and all were aided. He donated grain to establish charitable granaries, relieving the poor and needy. Scholars of the esoteric arts gathered daily at his gate, and each received according to their aspirations.\n\nIn the autumn of the second year of the Yanyou era, he journeyed with his disciples through mountains and caves, composing poems and painting scenes, all imbued with profound and cautionary meanings beyond mortal comprehension. On New Year’s Eve, he painted a self-portrait with an inscription, including the line, \"An eastern wind blows snow.\" The following year, on the first day of the first month, he composed a final ode and passed away. He was interred at Mingyang in Jinxī, and a shrine was erected, named the Xuandu Abbey.\n\nIn the second year of the Yuanzhen era, Emperor Chengzong issued the following decree: \"The thirty-eighth Celestial Master, Zhang Yucai, whose virtue shines like rainbow irises and golden stalks, ranks among the finest of his generation. His learning delves into the subtleties of the myriad realms, and his teachings illuminate the orthodox doctrines of the Three Origins. His ancestors and father have already been honored with titles, and he, peerless in brotherly virtue, fittingly perpetuates the true wind. We bestow special favor to express our esteem. As one who embodies the Dao and achieves merit, you shall invigorate the lineage of the sacred mountain, revering virtue to pray for Heaven’s eternal mandate. We now exalt the rituals of the imperial chambers, granting you the title 'Perfected of Supreme Simplicity, Spirit-Congealing, and Vast Dao,' overseeing Daoist affairs in the various circuits of Jiangnan.\"\n\nIn the eighth year of the Dade era, Emperor Chengzong issued another decree: \"Since ancient times, those who could eliminate harm for the state have been revered. The first patriarch of the Orthodox Unity tradition, in Shu, once subdued the serpent-dragon well’s malevolence, while the Master of Wondrous Observation, in Hangzhou, quelled the tide’s calamity. You, wielding the seal of the law for three years, have tamed the tides eroding the two prefectures of Haiguan. Through the power of iron talismans and cinnabar registers, the fish-headed, turtle-bodied horde was vanquished, the embankments restored, and the people spared from inundation. The provincial administration of Jiangzhe reported your deeds. Considering the counsel of the Orthodox Unity’s lineage master, your sincerity has moved Heaven, and your purity and non-action merit exaltation in the immortal ranks. We hereby appoint you Master of the Orthodox Unity Teachings, concurrently overseeing the talismanic registers of the Three Mountains, with all other titles remaining unchanged.\"\n\nIn the first year of the Zhida era, Emperor Chengzong issued yet another decree: \"To expel evil and uphold righteousness is of paramount importance to the world’s teachings. To honor virtue and reward merit is a fundamental principle of governance. Our sagely ancestors long revered the supreme Dao, and our late emperor repeatedly honored the true rites. Now, at the dawn of your succession, how could we delay in bestowing due honor? The Master of the Orthodox Unity Teachings, the thirty-eighth Celestial Master of the Han lineage, the Perfected of Supreme Simplicity, Spirit-Congealing, and Vast Dao, overseer of Daoist affairs in the various circuits of Jiangnan, and master of the talismanic registers of the Three Mountains, Zhang Yucai—your noble bearing and vast learning encompass all arts. Your profound exploration of principle flows like a deep spring, and your responsiveness is as effortless as a ring’s rotation. Governing the people, your efficacy is immediate; wielding the talismans, your reverence is unparalleled. When prayers for blessings are offered, they are swiftly answered; when admonitions are given, they embody perfect harmony. Your solemnity is beyond description, and your labors transcend the capacity of mere titles. Thus, we specially issue this decree to bestow further honor. Alas! The lofty traditions of the fiery Han are perpetuated by Heaven’s decree, and the great fortune of the Yuan dynasty is eternally secured. May you, in peace and prosperity, ever correspond to the vast mandate. We posthumously confer upon you the title 'Perfected of Supreme Simplicity, Spirit-Congealing, Vast Dao, and Illustrious Virtue,' Master of the Orthodox Unity Teachings, thirty-eighth Celestial Master of the Han lineage, overseeing Daoist affairs in the various circuits of Jiangnan.\"",

Serene and pure, she became a paragon of transcendence, and in her later years, a teacher of gods and humans. Fortunate indeed is the son who points to Penglai and departs, leaving behind the imperial edicts like discarded scrolls. Though the subtle and formless defy forced description, the state must duly honor her. We bestow a noble title to exalt the profound lineage. Alas! The sword is hidden by the altar, yet we still recall the mother of Wei who achieved the elixir; the thatched hut is raised for tranquility, and the mother’s aspiration transmits the Dao of Master Chen. We extend this favor to you, that you may roam freely. Thus, We posthumously enfeoff her as \"Mysterious Perfection and Wondrous Response, Profound Virtue, Compassionate and Salvific Primordial Lady.\"\n\nThe thirty-ninth Celestial Master, named Sicheng, styled Ciwang, and known as Master Tai Xuan, possessed a spirit clear and lofty, a demeanor resolute and reticent.

      "translated_text": "Suddenly, a fire broke out in Hangzhou City. The masses came seeking aid. The Celestial Master opened the Tongjiang Bridge, gazed toward the rising flames, and sprinkled water toward them—whereupon the fire was extinguished.\n\nIn the third year of the Yanyou era (1316), his father, the National Immortal, passed away. The seal and sword were conferred upon him, commanding him to inherit the teaching. He established a prefectural office at Zhang Zong, and his reputation reached the imperial court. Emperor Renzong dispatched envoys to the mountain, ordering him to preside over the Daoist affairs and summoning him to court. In the tenth month, he entered the audience hall. The Emperor questioned him at length and, pleased, exclaimed, “He is the very image of his father!” He commanded the performance of the Golden Register Grand Offering at Changchun Palace. Upon the ritual’s completion, he bestowed ceremonial robes and crowns. The following year, in the first month, the Celestial Master requested to return home. By imperial decree, he was appointed *Great Perfected of Grand Transformation, Embodied Benevolence, and Responsive Dao, Supreme Realized One of Tai Xuan*, charged with overseeing the talismanic registers of the Three Mountains and governing the Daoist affairs of Jiangnan. In recognition of his merit, his mother, née Yi, was enfeoffed as *Mysterious Radiance, Wisdom-Responsive, Eternally Tranquil Realized One*. An imperial edict was issued, commanding him to preside over the Daoist teachings, granting ordination certificates, authorizing the performance of ritual registers, and exempting him from distant corvée labor. Envoys were dispatched to escort him back to his mountain.\n\nIn the seventh year (1320), the sea tide surged again at Yanguan Prefecture. The Emperor ordered the Celestial Master to conduct a Grand Offering at the provincial headquarters. He cast an iron talisman into the crumbling riverbank, whereupon thunder and lightning erupted, and the waters receded to their former state.\n\nWhen Emperor Yingzong ascended the throne, he summoned the Celestial Master to an audience at Shangdu. An imperial edict was issued, and an escort provided for his return. In the second year of the Taiding era (1325), on the *renwu* day of the first month, a solar eclipse occurred. A high minister sought his prayers to invoke snow as an omen to avert disaster—whereupon the heavens unleashed a great snowfall. He was again commanded to perform the Yellow Register Grand Offering at Changchun Palace. At that time, auspicious omens of celestial flowers, clouds, and cranes appeared. Yu Ji, the Supervisor of the Directorate of Education, recorded the event by imperial command. The Celestial Master was further honored with the title *Orthodox Teaching Master of the Correct One, Grandly Virtuous, Supreme Perfected of Tai Xuan’s Grand Transformation, Embodied Benevolence, and Responsive Dao, Director of the Directorate of Education and Daoist Affairs*.\n\nIn the fourth year (1327), the tide at Yanguan Prefecture once more overflowed, causing the embankment to collapse and threaten the city. The Emperor summoned him to the provincial headquarters, where he performed an offering at Yousheng Palace. A three-legged tortoise appeared upon the palace hall, and the tide receded. The people of Hangzhou reported a drought, and rain immediately fell.\n\nIn the first year of the Zhishun era (1330), he entered court, where an imperial edict reaffirmed his protective authority. In the *Zhiyuan* era, he was again summoned to an audience with the Emperor at Mingren Hall. At that time, the capital region suffered from drought, and he was ordered to pray for rain at Chongzhen Palace—whereupon a great response occurred. In autumn, excessive rains fell, and his prayers brought clear skies. In winter, when no snow came, his supplications were immediately answered. The Emperor, greatly pleased, bestowed fine wine upon him and said to his ministers, “We have troubled the Celestial Master many times. Let the records of his past and present meritorious deeds be compiled in full for the imperial decree.”\n\nIn the third year (1337), in the third month, an edict was issued appointing him Director of the Directorate of Education. Having remained in the capital for some time, he requested to return to his mountain. The Emperor ordered the hundred officials to host a farewell banquet in his honor. Upon his return, he withdrew from worldly affairs, roaming freely in leisure.\n\nIn the fourth year of the Zhizheng era (1344), on the *jiashen* day, he prepared to journey to the Five Sacred Peaks and Mount Qingcheng, beginning with Mount Tai. In the ninth month, as his boat passed Lüliang, at dusk, an old man sought an audience and spoke to him in secret before departing after the passage of a brief moment. The next day, he abruptly ordered the boat to turn back. On the *gengzi* day, he arrived at Bao, where he transformed and passed away aboard the vessel. His disciples carried his crown and sword back, entering Poyang Lake and reaching Yun Jin Stream. Two black dragons guarded the boat, speeding it swiftly along. In less than six days, it reached its destination, borne by the current—such were his divine and wondrous signs. Later, he was interred on South Mountain.\n\n**Imperial Decree of Emperor Renzong of the Yuan:**\nWhen the realm possesses the Dao, it is fitting to honor the winds of purity and tranquility. When the Perfected One embodies non-action, he aids in the governance of grand peace. We proclaim and exalt his title, illuminating the lineage of the ancestral teaching. The Celestial Master Zhang Sicheng has attained the true essence of the Old Master’s teachings and stands as a pillar of the Mysterious Gate. From the Han dynasty onward, his lineage has endured for over a thousand years. Since crossing the Yangtze, four generations have passed. The thirty-ninth generation has mastered the profound teachings of the Jade Registers, inheriting the illustrious legacy of the Crimson Talismans. As recorded in the annals, when he first came to court, he conducted himself with utmost reverence, restoring the former ranks of the Immortal Officials while consolidating the new affairs of the teaching. He assisted in the establishment of the August Ultimate and expanded the imperial favor bestowed upon the grand enterprise—his fame is not undeserved. We specially bestow this grace to soothe and commend him, following the virtuous path of his ancestors. Let him ponder how to repay this favor, ever mindful of Our profound generosity, and never falter in his reverence. In recognition of his merit, his mother, née Yi, is enfeoffed as *Mysterious Radiance, Wisdom-Responsive, Eternally Tranquil Realized One*. A separate imperial edict is issued, commanding him to preside over the Daoist teachings.\n\n**Imperial Decree of Emperor Yingzong of the Yuan:**\nWe revere the Mandate of Heaven and admire the virtue of the Dao, seeking the means to pacify the people through stillness and unity. We honor the words of the Perfected One, extending glory to his descendants. The Celestial Master Zhang Sicheng, inheriting the teachings of the Old Master from his ancestors, upholds harmony, reveres correctness, and sustains the worldly teachings. His family’s legacy has been illustrious, and now it shines forth in him. His character is vast and far-reaching, his learning broad and profound. Since the previous reign, he has been deemed worthy to inherit the title, steadfastly continuing the virtuous path of his predecessors without cease. His humility and reticence have only enhanced his reputation. At the beginning of Our reign, he presented tribute and came to court, conducting himself with utmost reverence. We deem him worthy of esteem and renew Our command, reaffirming his former office. Let him unite his heart and mind to propagate his teachings, ever reverent and solemn, assisting in the governance of non-action. Let him never neglect his duties, ever mindful of his devotion. He is hereby appointed *Orthodox Teaching Master of the Correct One, Supreme Perfected of Tai Xuan’s Grand Transformation, Embodied Benevolence, and Responsive Dao, Celestial Master of the Han Succession, Director of the Directorate of Education and Daoist Affairs, Overseer of the Talismanic Registers of the Three Mountains, and Governor of the Daoist Affairs of Jiangnan*.\n\n**Imperial Decree of Prince Jin of the Yuan:**\nOur dynasty’s veneration of the Mysterious Teaching is unparalleled in antiquity. Your family’s reception of imperial favor has reached its zenith in this era. It is fitting to exalt your title and display Our esteem. The Celestial Master Zhang Sicheng is as pure as ice and snow, a divine person in this sagely age. Your ancestors and father accumulated merit and virtue in the past, while you and your descendants continue the legacy, adding luster to it. At the beginning of Our reign, you aided Us in revering virtue anew, conducting yourself with utmost care—truly reverent and courteous. The grand Dao is majestic, and together We aspire to purity and non-action. He is hereby appointed *Orthodox Teaching Master of the Correct One, Grandly Virtuous, Supreme Perfected of Tai Xuan’s Grand Transformation, Embodied Benevolence, and Vast Dao, Celestial Master of the Han Succession, Overseer of the Talismanic Registers of the Three Mountains, and Governor of the Daoist Affairs of Jiangnan*.",

      "translated_text": "His radiant virtue spread far and wide, and his numinous responses shone repeatedly. As you have faithfully succeeded your predecessors, so too have We been greatly aided by your forebears. In times past, when the seas rose in disaster, you twice delivered the common folk from drowning; more recently, when the heavens turned unruly, you thrice summoned rain and snow through your spiritual communion. Such merit, though never claimed, demands due recompense.\n\nAlas! The immortals take loyalty and filial piety as their foundation, and even they do not shrink from passing their legacy to the worthy. Emperors regard heaven and earth as their heart—how could they dare forget reverence for virtue? Your official titles and positions remain unchanged.\n\nThe Fortieth Celestial Master, named Side, styled Taiyi, was the second son of Yucai. Of generous and magnanimous nature, he excelled in literature and delighted in poetry. In the jiashen year of the Zhizheng era, he succeeded to the teaching. Nine years later, in the renchen year, as war engulfed the realm, he commanded his disciple Shu Weiyin to raise righteous troops for defense. Wherever his influence reached, neighboring prefectures remained unmolested, and the people lived in peace. That October, he fell mildly ill and passed away. The following year, an imperial decree posthumously bestowed upon him the title *Taiyi Mingjiao Guangxuan Tidao Da Zhenren*, Master of the Three Mountains’ Talismanic Registers and Overseer of Daoist Affairs in Jiangnan. The decree arrived after his death, and his remains were interred at Paisha Stone.\n\nEmperor Shundi of the Yuan issued an edict: \"The Perfected of the Orthodox Unity tradition have faithfully transmitted the secret talismans, registers, and sacred writs. Descended from a lineage of divine luminosity, they are fitting recipients of the cap, robes, sword, and seal. Their immortal records bear witness, and thus We bestow this honor anew. We address you, Zhang Side: your learning draws from your family’s teachings, and your Dao expands the ancestral covenant. Your forebears’ fragrance endures, and your descendants inherit their blessings. From the time your lineage first ascended in Shu and Han, your family has spread its transformative teachings across rivers and lakes. Precious registers and golden talismans once manifested their auspicious responses in ancient records; the Azure Serpent and Jade Sword trace their origins to the legacy of your robes and furs. Your efficacy in warding off misfortune has repeatedly aided the governance of peace. Though your titles were established in former dynasties, the grace of Our court remains abundant. Purple edicts and silver seals reflect the solemnity of Our praise; pearl crowns and golden robes illuminate the purity of your lineage. Now, with the Orthodox Unity tradition lacking its heir, the disciples unanimously acclaim the rightful successor. May you uphold the autumnal rites of the True Origin, solemnize the sacred altars of the Most High, and reverently contemplate the grandeur of your inherited mission. Strive further to succor all living beings, once more exalt the numinous and plain, and forever propagate the true winds of the Dao.\n\nAh! With jade tablets and lavish gifts, ever bear in mind your duty to serve the throne with sincerity. At the altar’s edge, with secret invocations, strictly guard the blessings that shield the people. Hold fast to Our embrace and thereby magnify your teaching.\"\n\nThe Forty-First Celestial Master, named Zhengyan, styled Shuhua, was the eldest son of Side. His countenance bore an ancient dignity, and his spirit was serene; he spoke little and was deeply composed. At the time, the road to the capital had been blocked for over two years. The Jiang-Zhe Branch Secretariat dispatched envoys to confer upon him the title *Tianshi Mingcheng Ningdao Hongwen Hudao Da Zhenren*, Master of the Three Mountains’ Talismanic Registers and Overseer of Daoist Affairs in Jiangnan. In his later years, he gathered his disciples and said: \"Our family has, for generations, taken the welfare of the state, loyalty to the sovereign, and the transformation of the people as our foundation. Now, as war rages across the land and the court grows distant, the fate of the realm remains uncertain. Among you, disciples who have united the Orthodox Unity teachings in the north have received exceptional favor—can you not offer a single word to bring forth an auspicious sign?\" Thereupon, his junior disciple Cheng Tianyi was dispatched to address the Grand Master of the Orthodox Unity tradition, who, upon entering the capital, presented a memorial to the throne. The emperor declared: \"The Celestial Master is a transcendent scholar. Formerly, with the roads to Shu obstructed, We had no means to extend Our soothing governance—this has long weighed upon Us. Now, by heaven’s mandate, this fortunate opportunity arises, and We entrust the Grand Master with this mission.\" Tianyi was sent back with the decree. In the jihai year, on the Middle Prime Festival, Zhengyan ascended the dais to expound the Dao. His words, though seemingly portentous, were scarcely understood by those present. Soon after, he fell mildly ill and summoned his disciples, saying: \"Since inheriting this teaching, I have endured many hardships. Now, my time of departure has come.\" Two days later, he wrote a hymn and passed away.\n\nThe Forty-Second Celestial Master, named Zhengchang, courtesy name Zhongji, styled Chongxuzi, was the eldest son of the Thirty-Ninth Celestial Master, Taixuan. His birth was marked by an auspicious sign: Taixuan, in a light slumber, dreamed of a divine being descending from the sky, who said, \"I come from Huagai Mountain and have wandered to your home. I wish to be received here.\" Upon waking, Zhengchang was born. As a child, he was exceptionally bright, of a particularly generous and magnanimous nature, and his eyes shone with an illuminating gaze. He was fond of the words of Laozi and Zhuangzi and devoted himself especially to the secret methods of the Daoist immortals. When Taixuan journeyed to the Five Peaks, he pointed to the transmitted seal and sword, saying: \"When the Dragon Star once more gathers in the *hai* position, my son shall wield these to greatly revive the winds of the Dao.\" In the jihai year of the Zhizheng era, Zhengchang succeeded to the teaching, fulfilling Taixuan’s prophecy.\n\nAmid the chaos of war, the scriptures and registers had long been hidden, but now seekers flocked from all directions. He performed the Three Primals Offerings at the altar of the Mysterious, and whenever he refined and delivered the suffering souls, extraordinary responses invariably occurred. In the xinchou year, the founding emperor of the Great Ming, Taizu, issued an imperial proclamation commanding officials to seek and invite him. The Celestial Master then set out on his journey. He dispatched envoys to ascend the plank roads, presenting omens of heaven’s ordained succession. The emperor responded with a handwritten letter, exhorting him to \"calm the heart and stabilize the nature, thereby consolidating the merit of the Dao.\" In the yisi year, he arrived at the capital. The emperor, upon receiving him, was pleased and said: \"Your eyes flash like lightning, and your demeanor is majestic—truly a descendant of the Han Celestial Masters!\" He commanded Zhengchang to be seated and hosted a banquet in his honor, later issuing an edict to praise him. He was summoned to a second audience and banquet, where he was presented with gold and silk before returning to his mountain.\n\nIn the bingwu year, he again journeyed to the capital. The gentry and commoners seeking talismans numbered in the thousands daily, overwhelming his attendants. He closed his gates to refuse them, but the requests did not cease. The emperor instructed him to distribute talismanic water. Thereupon, he inscribed a massive talisman and cast it into the well of Chaotian Palace. The people rushed to draw the water, and in an instant, the well ran dry, revealing the earth beneath. Yet they continued to dig, and those afflicted with epidemics who drank the water were all cured. The emperor, hearing of this, commended him and ordered a pavilion built over the well, naming it Taiyi Spring. He commanded the transmission of the *Taishang Yanxi* and other ritual registers. When Zhengchang sought to return to his mountain, the emperor again dispatched eunuchs to present him with brocade robes woven with gold patterns. He was also granted a travel pass by the Secretariat, facilitating his future audiences at court.",

      "translated_text": "In the first year of Hongwu, *dingwei* (1367), he journeyed to the capital to urge the emperor’s ascension to the throne. In the eleventh year of Hongwu, *wushen* (1368), the emperor ascended the great treasure throne, establishing the dynastic title and changing the reign era. Zhengchang entered the palace to offer congratulations and was granted an imperial banquet in the side hall. The emperor declared: “Hereby I bestow upon you the title of Grand Perfected One. A decree shall be issued to discuss your stipend.” Zhengchang respectfully declined the stipend in person, requesting only the continuation of former privileges—exemption from corvée and taxes—and the sole authority to issue talismans and registers. The emperor approved and commended him, granting tax exemptions for his entire household and assigning laborers of all kinds to the Great Shangqing Palace.\n\nAfter the banquet, an imperial edict was issued, its text recorded in the *Veritable Records of Imperial Ming Grace*: “We appoint the Master of Orthodox Unity, forty-second-generation Celestial Master of the Han succession, Grand Perfected One of National Protection, Ancestral Propagation, Sincere Devotion, and Vast Virtue, to oversee Daoist affairs, with a silver seal commensurate to the rank of principal second grade.” Special assistants were appointed to the Mystic Canopy, including Officiants of Doctrine and Scribes of the Registers. After receiving his leave, he departed.\n\nThe emperor, seated in the Hall of Reverent Self, remarked to him in leisure: “Your ancestor, the Celestial Master, rendered great service to the state. Thus, your family has been transmitted alongside Confucius down to the present day. You should embody this legacy with purity and non-action, aiding me in perfect governance, and I shall reward you accordingly.” He then presented fifteen *yi* of silver to renovate his residence.\n\nIn the second month of *jiyou* (1369), he was specially summoned to court. The emperor received him in the Hall of Heavenly Favors and, anticipating his arrival, had a banquet prepared. That month, he was granted four imperial audiences and two banquets. On the thirteenth day of the third month, the emperor prepared to offer sincere devotion to the Heavenly Emperor. After three days of purification rites, the emperor donned his ceremonial robe and cap, personally inscribing his name on the memorial. He ordered the Court of Imperial Sacrifices to prepare music and handed the document to the Perfected One, who was to pray and burn it. Upon the completion of the rites, the emperor bestowed gold and silk, hosted a banquet in the Literary Pavilion, and provided a separate feast for his disciples in another hall, with rewards distributed accordingly.\n\nIn the summer of *gengxu* (1370), the emperor, recognizing his merits and favor, specially instructed the Ministry of Rites to posthumously confer upon his father, the thirty-ninth-generation Celestial Master, the title Grand Perfected One of Great Mystery, Assisting Transformation, Embodied Benevolence, and Responsive Dao. His successor was named Grand Perfected One of Orthodox Unity, Great Mystery, Vast Transformation, Illuminated Accomplishment, and Venerable Dao. His mother, the Illuminated Wisdom Compassionate and Compliant Immortal Lady Hu, was re-titled the Reverent, Compliant, Kind, and Tranquil Mystic Lady.\n\nThat autumn, the emperor summoned him again and inquired about the nature of spirits and gods, further granting him a silver seal to oversee all Daoist affairs under heaven. In the autumn of *renzi* (1372), he was specially summoned to court and honored with an additional decree to permanently oversee all Daoist affairs.\n\nIn the autumn of *bingshen* (1376), the emperor dispatched an envoy to summon him. Unexpectedly, he arrived ahead of schedule. Upon his audience, the emperor rejoiced: “Why does your arrival so perfectly accord with my intentions? Next autumn, I shall send envoys to offer sacrifices to the gods of the seas and mountains. You should select your most diligently cultivated disciples to accompany them.” He was granted a banquet, a golden ritual robe, a jade tablet, and ritual implements.\n\nIn the summer of *dingsi* (1377), he led his disciples to court. A banquet was held atop the Meridian Gate’s city tower, where the emperor raised his cup and said: “You should drain this goblet.” He then ordered the eunuchs to present an imperial composition—a eulogy for the Celestial Masters of past dynasties—saying: “One day, I shall inscribe this and bestow it upon you.” The next day, he was dispatched to offer sacrifices at Mount Song, while high officials and disciples were sent to perform rites at the Five Peaks. Each was granted two sets of robes and varying amounts of paper money. Upon his return, he was rewarded with a banquet as before.\n\nUpon returning to his mountain, his aspirations grew unusual. One day, he prepared wine and drank heartily with his brothers. Sighing deeply, he said: “The Five Peaks and famous mountains—my late father longed to visit them but never did. The Central Peak of Mount Song is where our ancestor received the *Taiqing Alchemical Canon*. Now, by the sacred virtue of the Son of Heaven, I have been fortunate enough to arrive here. I shall gaze upon the rosy dawn in the layered clouds and let the vast kalpas drift like floating dust—my resolve is set.” All marveled at his words.\n\nSoon after, he fell ill. Seated upright on his bed, he instructed his disciple Fang Congyi: “I have no way to repay the imperial favor. You must assist my descendants in promoting the mandate of peaceful governance.” He took his seal and sword and handed them to his son, saying: “Our family’s fifteen-hundred-year transmission rests upon this. You must strive diligently.” With these words, he raised his hand in a circular gesture and passed away in silence.\n\nThat night, a great cliff collapsed, its sound echoing for tens of miles. Minister of Rites Zhang Chou reported the news. The emperor sighed in grief for a long while, then said: “I intended to command him to oversee sacrifices at the Five Peaks. Now, he has only just reached Mount Song—how could his allotted span end here?” He personally composed a eulogy and dispatched An Qing, former Vice Minister of the Zhejiang Branch Secretariat, to offer condolences and sacrifices. His remains were interred at the mouth of Cikeng Ravine on South Mountain.\n\nThe forty-third-generation Celestial Master, named Yu Chu, styled Zixuan, with the sobriquet Qishan, was the eldest son of Chongxu. His eyes were strikingly bright, with two pupils resembling twin stars.",

      "translated_text": "At the age of nine, he bore the gravity of a seasoned elder. One day, a remarkable figure sought an audience, declaring: “This is a scholar among the immortal ranks—one who shall one day greatly expand this teaching.” As he matured, his intellect and insight soared, his learning profound. He mastered the Three Teachings, fusing them into a single path, and delved into the works of the Hundred Schools, exhaustively exploring their depths. His writings, whether conveying the Dao or recording events, achieved exquisite refinement. He compiled the *Jianquan Literary Collection* in twenty scrolls, which so impressed the Prince of Liao that he had it printed. When the work reached the emperor’s hands, he was summoned to court and showered with favor. Even the nobility and gentry held him in the highest esteem.\n\nOnce, while attending Chongxu at the Heavenly Heart Moon-on-Water Pavilion, he witnessed clouds rising in the northwest, parting to reveal a golden gate flung open amid a radiant glow of five colors. Celestial guards stood in solemn array, their mirrored armor gleaming. Startled, he changed countenance. Chongxu questioned him, and he recounted all he had seen. From then on, Chongxu entrusted him with the family’s secret *Yijing* teachings. When tested, his divinations grew ever more uncanny.\n\nIn the eleventh year of Hongwu, he was summoned to court. The emperor examined him closely, then smiled and said, “He is the very image of his father.” His favor deepened. The following year, the emperor dispatched an envoy to the mountain, bestowing a precious edict and exhorting the Two Ways. He was invested as the Orthodox Unity Successor of the Dao, Grand Realized One of the Unbounded Clarity and Ancestral Radiance, and charged with propagating the teachings. Another imperial handwritten edict urged him to cultivate his integrity further to align with the will of the gods. He was granted ritual robes, gold, and silk, along with travel warrants to return to the mountain.\n\nIn the year *xinyou*, an edict was issued, ennobling his mother, Lady Bao, as the Mysterious and Virtuous Lady of Pure Emptiness. In *guihai*, he was summoned to the capital and commanded to conduct the *Jade Register* Grand Offering on Purple Gold Mountain. In *yichou*, he was ordered to pray for rain at the Divine Music Abbey, and the prayers were swiftly answered. In *gengwu*, he was received in audience and approved the reconstruction of the Great Supreme Clarity Palace. On the first day of the sixth month in *xinyou*, the emperor held court and decreed through the Ministry of Rites that counterfeit talismans be strictly prohibited. He bestowed the Seal of the Orthodox Unity Mystic Altar to authenticate talismans and perpetually guard the sacred mountains.\n\nUpon his return, he selected a site beneath Huangzhu Peak in his hometown and built the Jianquan Retreat as his final abode. In *renwu*, when Emperor Chengzu ascended the throne, he journeyed to offer congratulations and was met with even greater favor. The emperor bestowed fine silk and funds for the restoration of the Great Supreme Clarity Palace. In the first year of Yongle, he was commanded to assist in the sacrifices at the Altar of Heaven.

In the tenth month, he was ordered to conduct the *Pudu* deliverance ritual at the Lingji Palace in the capital.\n\nOn the first day of the new year in *xinchou*, he was appointed to offer secondary sacrifices at the Altar of the Stars and later to perform the *Bao’an* ritual for safeguarding peace. On the seventh day, he was granted ceremonial robes, jade pendants, brocade, fine silks, sable furs, and other regalia.\n\nUpon the emperor’s return to the capital after his northern campaign, he commanded the performance of a grand thanksgiving rite.

In *jiachen*, he was ordered to conduct rituals at Mount Taihe.\n\nWhen Emperor Renzong the Illustrious ascended the throne, he journeyed to offer congratulations and was commanded to perform the *Jianyang* grand purification rite, which also yielded extraordinary signs.

The emperor received him in the inner palace for a banquet. In the fourth month, imperial favor was extended, and a decree reaffirmed his honorific title.

      "translated_text": "The Forty-Fifth Celestial Master, named Maocheng, styled Wenkai, with the sobriquet Jiuyang, maintained a serene and detached heart, untethered by worldly attachments, and was also known as Danran. He was the direct descendant of Chongxu and the nephew of Qishan and Xibi. Initially, his father Yuli was seated in the central courtyard on the twelfth month of the *bingyin* year of the Hongwu era when a Daoist suddenly appeared for an audience, his attire and appearance most extraordinary. The visitor called himself Chongyangzi and presented a chrysanthemum plant, saying, \"I humbly request lodging under your roof for sixty years.\" With these words, he vanished. At first, Yuli found this strange, but later realized it was the Perfected One Chongyang. The following ninth month on the ninth day, the Celestial Master was born, and the fragrance of chrysanthemums filled the room while purple clouds enveloped the house, dissipating only after three days. At the age of four, he imitated the *Yu step*, and faint thunder rumbled in response. Thinking it coincidental, he was asked to repeat the step, and the thunder resounded even louder. When taught the Confucian classics and esoteric Daoist texts, he memorized ten thousand words a day, and his literary compositions and calligraphy surpassed his contemporaries. Once, while traveling through mountains and marshes, someone warned of a fallen tree blocking the path ahead. The attendants suggested taking a side route, but the Celestial Master said, \"I bear the responsibility of guiding the people. A true person does not take crooked paths.\" Shortly after, a fierce wind arose, and upon arrival, the tree had already been uprooted. Upon entering the capital and passing through Wulin, where an epidemic raged, the afflicted sought talismans in such numbers that he could not fulfill all requests. He then inscribed a massive talisman and cast it into a well. The people rushed to draw the water, which soon ran dry, yet those who drank were cured. When he traveled to Huagai Mountain, auspicious lights frequently appeared, and at night, heavenly lamps shone like scattered stars. His numinous efficacy manifested in many such ways.\n\nIn the twenty-second year of the Hongwu era, his father Yuli was summoned by the Taizu Emperor along with the Perfected One of Wuwei. Their audience was greatly appreciated, and they were rewarded with gold and silk. The emperor commanded the former Censor-in-Chief, the Duke of Sincerity Liu Ji, to betroth his brother’s daughter to the Celestial Master, who was thus born of the Liu clan. When he later had an audience, he was granted a banquet in the Convenience Hall. The following year, he was ordered to transmit the *Tai Shang Yan Xi Lu* and conduct the *Yan Xi* Offering in the imperial palace. Upon completion, he was bestowed with a coronet, robes, a sword, and other regalia. In the fourth month, he accompanied the emperor in offering sacrifices at the Imperial Ancestral Temple and was conferred by edict the title *\"Zhengyi Successor of the Teachings, Reverent Cultivator of the Supreme Dao, Preserver of Simplicity, Propagator of the Dharma, Perfected One,\"* charged with overseeing all Daoist affairs.\n\nIn the spring of the *jiyou* year, he attended the imperial birthday celebration and was ordered to conduct offerings at the Eastern Sacred Mount Altar and perform the Offering in the Hall of Benevolence and Wisdom, receiving further rewards. In the third month, the emperor summoned him to the Western Palace and, greatly pleased with their conversation, recommended the eminent Daoists Cao Kehong, Gong Jizong, Yan Fuyuan, and Huang Jiayou of the Supreme Clarity Abbey for positions in the Daoist Registry. The emperor approved and dispatched the eunuch Li Du to the mountain to summon them. In the twelfth month, an edict posthumously honored his late wife, Lady Sun, with the title *\"Gentle, Auspicious, Chaste, and Tranquil Mystic Lady.\"*\n\nIn the *xinhai* year, he had an audience and was ordered to conduct offerings at the Altar of the Stars and perform the Offering at the Inner Imperial Altar, receiving gifts of eight treasures from the imperial workshops and gold and silk. In the fourth month, he accompanied the emperor in offering sacrifices at the Imperial Ancestral Temple. Upon completion, a eunuch was specially dispatched to escort him back to the mountain.\n\nIn the winter of the *guichou* year, he had an audience, and the following spring, he was ordered to perform the Offering at the Abbey of Numinous Aid. In the third month, when the heir apparent fell ill, he was summoned to treat him, and the prince recovered. The emperor was delighted and bestowed upon him a coronet, sword, and robes. He was ordered to conduct offerings at the Altar of Wind, Clouds, Thunder, and Rain and perform the *Bao’an* Offering at the Abbey of Great Virtue, receiving further gifts of gold and silk. Five hundred ordination certificates were issued to tonsure Daoist priests. Though he sought to return home, he was detained.\n\nIn the fifth month, he was summoned for an audience in the inner court and was presented with the emperor’s *Zhao Yin Ge* (Song of Summoning the Recluse) to take back to the mountain. Upon reaching the post station at Jia Ma Camp, the emperor again dispatched an envoy to bestow secret instructions, exhorting him to cultivate the Daoist arts and not to neglect the ancestral teachings.\n\nWhen the Ruizong Emperor ascended the throne in the Zhengtong era, the Celestial Master attended the court to offer congratulations. An edict was issued to construct the Celestial Master’s Residence in the northeastern corner of the Chaotian Abbey, a command of the late emperor that was now completed. Ritual officials were sent to welcome him to reside there, and he was provided with provisions. He was ordered to conduct the *Sheng Zhen* Grand Fast at the abbey. The following New Year’s Day, he was granted a banquet in the Hall of Heavenly Favor. On the eleventh day, he was ordered to conduct offerings at the Altar of Wind, Clouds, Thunder, and Rain. The next day, he was summoned for an audience and then invited to dine with the Duke Yansheng in the Convenience Hall, each receiving gifts of gold, silk, python robes, and vermilion shoes. That month, he was ordered to transmit the *Tai Shang Yan Xi* scriptures and conduct the *Jin Lu Yan Xi* Offering at the Chaotian Abbey, receiving further rewards.\n\nIn the spring of the *jiwei* year, he was ordered to conduct offerings at the Eastern Sacred Mount Altar. In the second month, on the empress dowager’s birthday, he conducted the *Zhu Yan* Offering at the Chaotian Abbey. Upon completion, he was bestowed with gold and silk. In the *gengshen* year, an edict honored his second wife, Lady Dong, with the title *\"Warm, Tranquil, Gentle, and Compliant Mystic Lady.\"* In the third month, he was ordered to install and offer sacrifices to the golden statue of the Dark Emperor at the Dark Heaven Shrine in the imperial palace. After the rites, he was commanded to present his ancestral seal and sword for the emperor’s inspection. The emperor examined them for a long time, sighing, \"Truly, these are divine and numinous objects!\" He then hosted a banquet and bestowed further rewards before sending him off.\n\nIn the first month of the *xinyou* spring, he was ordered to conduct offerings at the Eastern Sacred Mount Altar and perform the Offering at the Chaotian Abbey. Five hundred and two ordination certificates were issued to tonsure Daoist priests, and he was generously rewarded before returning. In the winter of the *renxu* year, he attended the court and was granted a banquet in the Hall of Literary Splendor.\n\nIn the spring of the *guihai* year, he was ordered to conduct offerings at the Altar of the Stars and perform the Offering at the Chaotian Abbey. The following year, he sought to return home. In his memorial, he stated: \"I have been showered with the favor of two reigns, yet I have no means to repay even a fraction. I fear my Heaven-bestowed years are limited and that I may not long bask in Your Majesty’s radiant presence. I have a son who died young, but my eldest grandson, Yuanji, though only of age, possesses an extraordinary nature. I humbly request that he take my place to repay the imperial grace.\" The emperor repeatedly urged him to stay, but eventually permitted him to return home. He entrusted the seal and sword to Yuanji, saying, \"I have received the court’s approval. My child, exert yourself and forever uphold Heaven’s favor.\" With these words, he sat upright and passed away at the age of fifty-nine, fulfilling the sixty-year lodging promised by Chongyangzi.\n\nWhen news of his death reached the court, an edict was issued to dispatch the Minister of Rites Zhao Zui to offer sacrifices in his honor, and the Ministry of Works official Jiang Qing to oversee his burial on Ma’an Mountain. An abbey named Southern Culmen was established there to honor him.",
      "overlap_context": "reat Perfected One,\"* charged with overseeing all Daoist affairs throughout the realm.\n\nThereafter, rainbows frequently appeared, filling the valleys with light before dissolving. When news of his passing reached the court, the emperor dispatched Eunuch Lei Chun to offer sacrifices in his honor. He was further honored with burial on the right flank of the Northern Perfected Abbey.\n\n*Concluded: Records of the Han Celestial Masters, Scroll Three*\n*Records of the Han Celestial Masters, Scroll Four*",

      "translated_text": "The Forty-Sixth Celestial Master, named Yuanji, styled Mengyang, with the sobriquet Taihe, was the grandson of Danran and the posthumously honored Serene Perfected’s son. His mother, the Mystic Lady Gao, dreamed of the Long-Star descending like a rainbow, transforming into a white phoenix that alighted upon her bosom. Upon waking, the room remained suffused with light, and she conceived. In the spring of the *yimao* year, on the ninth day of the first month, he was born, and at that moment, a lingzhi mushroom emerged from beneath the base of a wooden pillar. From childhood, he was exceptionally bright and quick-witted, mastering his grandfather’s secret texts and Confucian classics at a single glance. He delighted in composing poetry, yet his verses transcended worldly language, leaving all who read them in awe.\n\nIn the winter of the *yichou* year of the Zhengtong era, he journeyed to the capital at the tender age of eleven. The emperor, struck by his precocious wisdom, summoned him to the inner court, seated him, and offered tea. He was then bestowed with an edict appointing him as the Orthodox Unity Successor of the Teachings, the Unassuming and Pure Inheritor of the Ancestral and Venerable Daoist Methods, Perfected of Authentic Oneness, to oversee Daoist affairs. Laden with generous gifts, he returned home.\n\nThe following winter, he was summoned to the Renzhi Hall, where he was ordered to inscribe a talisman for Marshal Zhao. Suddenly, the roar of a divine tiger echoed, startling the emperor, who marveled and praised him. He was granted a coronet, robes, jade pendants, and gold and silk, while his father, Liu Gang, was posthumously honored as the Orthodox Unity Successor of the Teachings, the Reverent and Mystic Cultivator of Tranquility, Serene Perfected. His mother, Lady Gao, was enfeoffed as the Compassionate, Benevolent, Serene, and Chaste Mystic Lady.\n\nIn the *dingmao* year, the emperor, mindful of his youth and orphaned state, issued stern edicts to prohibit his clansmen from bullying or humiliating him. He further appointed officials such as the Assistant Instructor and Scribe to assist him. In the *wuchen* year, the emperor received him at the Dashan Hall, and his responses met with approval, earning him gifts of a bejeweled coronet and embroidered robes. In the *jisi* year, on New Year’s Day, he was commanded to conduct the secondary sacrifice at the Altar of the Stars.\n\nIn the third month, he sought leave to return home, but the emperor urged him to stay. That summer, in the sixth month, thunder shattered the roof tiles of the Jinshen Hall, striking the *chiwen* ornament, and rain persisted for ten days. When summoned to inquire about the emperor’s well-being, he cautioned against border threats. The emperor ordered a rite for clear skies at the Chaotian Abbey and summoned the Thunder God. A great eagle with azure spurs and crimson wings soared in on a mighty wind, shrieking at the Penglai Gate. It seized the talisman, ascending through the clouds, while onlookers paled in astonishment. The skies cleared instantly. The court officials, hearing of the emperor’s astonishment and delight, bestowed even greater rewards.\n\nIn the seventh month, as the emperor embarked on his northern expedition, the empress commanded a rite for his safety in the inner court. When the Jingtai era began, in the eighth month, the Jing Emperor summoned him for an audience, questioning him repeatedly. He was ordered to perform a rite to safeguard the nation at the Dade Abbey, where auspicious clouds of celestial flowers and towering peaks appeared, prompting imperial praise and rewards.\n\nThe following year, in the first month, he was granted a thousand ordination certificates to tonsure Daoist priests. In the winter of the *renshen* year, he conducted a rite in the inner court, and upon its completion, was feasted at the Renzhi Hall. In the spring of the *guiyou* year, he was commanded to conduct the secondary sacrifice at the Altar of Wind, Clouds, Thunder, and Rain at the Chaotian Abbey.\n\nIn the spring of the *yihai* year, the emperor received him at the Wenhua Hall and inquired about the secret methods of the Thunder Gods. When he inscribed a talisman, the emperor exclaimed in delight, “A lineage of divine brilliance, unbroken through the generations—truly, you are a worthy successor!” This was deemed a great honor. In the fourth month, he was ordered to perform the Golden Register and Yellow Register grand rites at the Lingji Abbey. Auspicious clouds, five-colored and swirling like a chariot canopy, gathered over the altar, while phoenixes and cranes arrived early, drawing tens of thousands of spectators. The court officials reported this to the emperor, who praised him and issued an edict, promoting him to Orthodox Unity Successor of the Teachings, the Unassuming and Pure Inheritor of the Ancestral and Venerable Daoist Methods, the Serene and Tranquil, Mystic and Harmonious Great Perfected, to oversee all Daoist affairs. He was granted a jade coronet, jade pendants, robes, shoes, and other gifts. A ritual sword was specially forged by the imperial workshops and bestowed upon him, with an imperial envoy escorting him back to his mountain.\n\nIn the first year of the Tianshun era, when Emperor Yingzong the Wise was restored to the throne, Yuanji entered the capital in the second month to offer congratulations. He was commanded to perform a rite of thanksgiving in the inner court, receiving even greater favor and rewards. In the seventh month, edicts were issued to suppress the fraudulent distribution of talismans and to prohibit clansmen from bullying him.\n\nIn the winter of the *jimao* year, he entered the capital and was feasted in the inner court. The emperor again commanded the transmission of the *Taishang Yanxi* and other secret texts. In the spring of the *gengchen* year, he was ordered to assist in the sacrifices at the Altar of Heaven. The emperor, observing the fast in the imperial retreat, questioned him, and his responses met with approval. He was granted a robe of golden chainmail and an edict, while his mother, Lady Gao, was promoted to Grand Mystic Lady.\n\nIn the fourth month of the *xinsi* year, the emperor dispatched an envoy bearing a precious edict to his mountain, summoning him to the capital to perform a rite at the Xuantian Shrine in the palace. Auspicious signs appeared. In the seventh month, as flames from the God of Fire raged at the Chengtian Gate, he was ordered to perform a rite of exorcism and thanksgiving at the Chaotian Abbey. On the seventh day, the river surged, and the palace moat overflowed. The emperor, deeply impressed, bestowed upon him coronets, robes, swords, and other regalia, along with graded rewards for his disciples.\n\nHe was again summoned for an audience, where he petitioned for a general amnesty. The following year, in the third month, he took leave of the emperor and returned to the Di River. The emperor dispatched Liu Sheng, a centurion of the Embroidered Uniform Guard, to escort him with the original travel warrants, augmented by swift horses and boats.\n\nIn the spring of the *jiashen* year, he entered the capital. As the emperor ascended the throne, omens appeared, and he was ordered to inscribe a talisman to suppress them. The next morning, a strange bird was found dead beneath the felt mat. The emperor commanded the eunuch Qian Yi to lead guards to the Chaotian Abbey, where it was burned to ashes, and the disturbances ceased.\n\nOnce, the emperor awoke from sleep with a dull pain in his foot, which he endured until dawn. Upon inspection, a black mark resembling a finger’s imprint was found. An imperial envoy was sent to convey the emperor’s concern, and Yuanji presented talismanic water to wash it away. The mark faded, and the ailment vanished.\n\nSoon after, as the emperor presided in the Hall of Heavenly Favor, a sound like falling timber or crushing stone echoed from the sky. The emperor, alarmed, ordered rites of exorcism and thanksgiving. That night, the noise ceased, and Yuanji was held in even higher esteem. An edict promoted him to Orthodox Unity Successor of the Teachings, the Profoundly Enlightened and Mystically Responsive, the Silent and Tranquil, the Dao-Expounding and Transformation-Manifesting Great Perfected, to oversee all Daoist affairs. His mother, the Compassionate, Benevolent, Serene, and Chaste Grand Mystic Lady Gao, was further honored as the Compassionate, Harmonious, Upright, Benevolent, Chaste, and Virtuous Grand Mystic Lady. Laden with generous gifts, he returned to his mountain.\n\nWhen Emperor Xianzong the Pure ascended the throne, in the ninth month of the first year of the Chenghua era, Yuanji entered the capital to offer congratulations and was feasted at the Wenhua Hall.",

On the eleventh day, he was commanded to preside over the offerings at the Altar of Wind, Clouds, Thunder, and Rain.\n\nIn the second month, he was ordered to conduct the Ascension to Perfection Ritual at the Temple of Great Virtue. The Emperor issued decrees prohibiting clansmen from encroachment and others from forging talismans and registers, while appointing Assistant Instructors, Scribes, and other officials to aid in the governance of Daoist affairs.\n\nIn the autumn of the *dinghai* year, he entered court and was summoned to the Hall of Great Goodness, where he was commanded to present the ancestral seal and sword for the Emperor’s inspection.

The imperial address exhorted him to protect the state and pacify the people. He was bestowed a golden seal for the Orthodox Unity Successor of the Teachings Great Perfected Residence, along with an additional jade seal. The Emperor personally inscribed the characters “Great Perfected Residence” and ordered them carved and mounted upon the gate of his estate. Threefold imperial grace was conferred, and his title was further elevated to Orthodox Unity Successor of the Teachings, the Profoundly Silent and Mystically Perceptive, the Dao-Expounding, Transformation-Manifesting, Virtue-Assisting, Sage-Protecting, and Wondrously Responsive Great Perfected, charged with overseeing all Daoist affairs throughout the realm.

      "translated_text": "The Forty-Seventh Heavenly Master, named Xuánqìng, styled Tiānxī, with the sobriquet Zhēnyī and also called the Seven-One Elder, exhibited extraordinary signs at birth. He was broadly learned and skilled in literature, excelling in poetry and classical texts.\n\nIn the *dīngyǒu* year of the Chenghua reign, he was summoned to court and feasted in the inner palace. Eunuch Liáng Fāng was dispatched to convey the imperial decree, betrothing the daughter of Duke Zhū Yí of Chengguo to him as his consort. The following year, he was ordered to journey to the southern capital to complete the marriage. He was further bestowed python robes and a jade belt, and provided with swift horses and boats for his return. He was then invested as the Orthodox Successor of the Zhengyi Tradition, the Great Perfected Who Preserves Harmony, Cultivates Simplicity, Inherits the Ancestral Dao, and Oversees the Affairs of Daoism, while his mother, Lady Wú, was enfeoffed as the Mysterious Sovereign of Aspiring Virtue and Tranquil Serenity.\n\nIn the *jiǎchén* year, an edict was issued to strictly prohibit the forgery and private distribution of talismans, as well as the theft of fish from the ponds of released life. In the spring of the *yǐsì* year, the Jiangxi provincial officials were specially instructed to rebuild the residence of the Great Perfected, and he was commanded to offer incense at Mount Dahuagai and the Iron Pillar Palace. In the *bǐngwǔ* year, he was summoned to court and ordered to perform the Jiao Ritual at the Hall of Reverent Peace, where he received gifts of a jade belt and gold silk.\n\nUpon the ascension of the Xiaozong Emperor, in the *wùshēn* year of the Hongzhi reign, he presented congratulations at court and received even greater imperial favor. In the summer of the *gēngxū* year, when lightning struck a pillar of the Hall of Solemn Vigilance, he was ordered to perform a prayer and thanksgiving Jiao at the Hall of Reverent Peace. Heaven responded with auspicious omens of falling blossoms and propitious clouds, for which the emperor commended him and further commanded him to perform a Jiao for the imperial heir within the palace. The following year, upon the birth of the crown prince, he was bestowed a carved jade belt inscribed with \"Heavenly Fortune\" and \"Longevity,\" a gold coronet, python robes, and silver silk.\n\nIn the *bǐngchén* year, the emperor dispatched eunuchs Lǐ Jǐn and Lǐ Zhēn bearing gifts, ordering him to conduct the Great Jiao for the Protection of the People at the Supreme Clarity Palace, with Governor Dèng Yuán and the two provincial commissioners officiating the rites. Auspicious omens of cranes dancing in the sky and clouds resembling canopy appeared. In the winter of the *wùwǔ* year, he was ordered to pray for snow at the Temple of Heavenward Ascent, and the following day, heavy snow fell. In the spring of the *jǐwèi* year, he was commanded to transmit the *Secret Records of Supreme Prolonged Felicity*, receiving two boxes of ivory-carved seals and gold silk before taking leave.\n\nIn the fifth month, as his boat passed the Gutou Sluice, the water was too shallow to proceed. The assistant magistrate Méng requested a prayer, so he inscribed an iron talisman and cast it into White Elephant Pool. By dusk, clouds gathered densely, and rain poured down in torrents, allowing his banners and flags to advance. In the winter of the *xīnyǒu* year, he was summoned to court with his heir. The emperor received them in the Hall of Reverent Peace, bestowing robes and a belt upon the heir and commanding them to be seated. They were feasted within the hall, and his request to retire was granted.\n\nThe following spring, upon his return from offering sacrifices at the Changling Mausoleum, he was feasted in the side hall and honored with an edict of retirement. In the fourth month, he was dispatched to offer incense at the Five Sacred Mountains: Tianmu, Gexian, Huagai, Wudang, and Heming. Upon his return, he reported his mission and was rewarded with a banquet. The emperor further ordered the Tongzhou Guard to dispatch officers and soldiers to escort him back to the mountain.\n\nIn the *jiǎzǐ* year, his heir was summoned to court and presented with a self-painted sacred portrait and an ancient sword desired by the emperor. In return, the emperor bestowed upon him a portrait of the Ancestral Heavenly Master and gold silk. In the second month of the *yǐchǒu* spring, the emperor, mindful of his devotion, specially issued an edict of commendation and further instructed him to journey to the Three Sacred Mountains—Wudang, Heming, and Gexian—bearing imperial incense and candles to be conveyed to the mountains as an expression of reverence for the deities.\n\nThereupon, he ascended perilous peaks and explored numinous caves. Later, while traversing the rugged paths of Heming Mountain, he encountered an old man in crane-like robes with the countenance of a crane, who approached and bowed to him. The old man laughed and said:\n*\"Coming and going, one hears not the mountain crows’ clamor;\nUpon the Three Lives’ stone, the dragon and snake mark the years.\"*\nWith that, he brushed his sleeves against the green cliff and vanished. The Heavenly Master lingered for a long while before returning in melancholy.\n\nIn the ninth month of the *jǐsì* autumn, he hosted a banquet for his guests and drank to great merriment. Raising his cup, he addressed Prefect Lín and Vice-Commissioner Wáng, saying: *\"I have an old friend’s appointed time to keep, and I fear this gathering may be difficult to repeat. Yet you, my lords, bear the hopes of governing an era of peace—strive on.\"* All present took his words as drunken ramblings and paid them no heed.",

      "translated_text": "After the wine was finished, he instructed his attendants to place a rush cushion to the west of the Dark Altar. Composed and at ease, he faced north in cross-legged meditation. Reciting once more the old man’s words, he transformed, leaving his mortal remains enshrined at the Longevity Abbey in Jīnxī.\n\nThe Forty-Eighth Heavenly Master, named Yànchán, styled Shìzhān, with the sobriquet Zhànrán, was born after the True Unity Elder dreamed of a divine being planting a catalpa in his courtyard, girded with a sword. In his youth, he bore the manner of his grandfather and father. In the *xīnyǒu* year of the Hóngzhì era, at just twelve years of age, he accompanied his father to court by imperial summons. The emperor regarded him with wonder, hosting a banquet in his honor at the Qīn’ān Hall and bidding him sit. The Three Palaces all summoned him for an audience, bestowing rewards of varying degrees. He was conferred the title of *Zhēnyī Sìjiào Zhìxū Chōngjìng Chéngxiān Hónghuà Zhēnrén*, Master of the Orthodox Unity Teachings, Inheriting the Void and Embracing Stillness to Uphold the Ancestral Dao and Transform All, charged with overseeing the affairs of Daoism throughout the realm. Upon returning home, he sought learning but received no esoteric transmissions. After delving deeply into the ancient classics, he served his parents with utmost filial devotion, earning the praise of his clan and village.\n\nWhen the Martial Ancestor Emperor ascended the throne, in the spring of the *bǐngyín* year of the Zhèngdé era, the Heavenly Master entered the capital to offer congratulations and was summoned for an audience. The emperor asked, *\"Is your ancestral master not a divine immortal? I have heard that divine immortals endure forever. Might one still meet them today? And can one learn their ways?\"* The Heavenly Master replied, *\"I have heard that those who surpass divine immortals are rulers like Yáo and Shùn, who endure to this day. From the Son of Heaven to the common folk, none have failed to witness their legacy. If Your Majesty aspires to emulate them, your sagely longevity may equal heaven and earth. As for those like myself who are deemed divine immortals, what worth do we truly hold?\"* With this, he petitioned to return to his mountain.\n\nIn the *wùchén* year, he issued departmental certificates to ordain Daoist priests universally. In the *gēngwǔ* year, he memorialized the throne to request the reconstruction of the Great Supreme Clarity Palace, fulfilling the late emperor’s command. The court dispatched the eunuch supervisor Lǐ Wén, along with the regional military and civil governors of Jiāngxī, to oversee the project.\n\nIn the *rénshēn* year, he was summoned for an audience and commanded to assist in the sacrifices at the Tàitán Altar, receiving gifts of a python robe and jade belt. In the *gēngchén* year, as the imperial carriage embarked on a southern progress, rumors arose of demons lurking in the rear lake of Niúshǒu Mountain. The Heavenly Master was summoned to the imperial encampment and ordered to expel them. He indeed encountered and slew a demonic entity. The emperor was greatly pleased and ordered him to accompany the imperial retinue back to the capital.\n\nWhen the Solemn Ancestor Emperor ascended the throne, in the first year of the Jiājìng era, the Heavenly Master entered the capital to offer congratulations. The emperor bestowed inquiries upon him, to which he responded with the virtues of a pure heart and few desires, much to the emperor’s approval. The imperial favor was profound, and he was specially permitted to return to his mountain to retrieve and present the secret *Yánxǐ Lù* texts of the Supreme Ones. In the *guǐwèi* year, an edict was issued to betroth Lady Liǔ, daughter of the Marquis of Ānyuǎn, as his second wife, with the inner and outer guard officers of the southern capital ordered to escort him for the wedding procession.\n\nIn the *bǐngwǔ* year, he was granted an edict conferring the title of *Zhēnyī Sìjiào Huáixuán Bàozhēn Yǎngsù Shǒumò Bǎoguāng Lǚhé Zhìxū Chōngjìng Chéngxiān Hónghuà Dà Zhēnrén*, Great Perfected One of Orthodox Unity Teachings, Embracing the Mysterious and Preserving the True, Nurturing Simplicity and Guarding Silence, Radiant in Harmony and Upholding the Void to Embrace Stillness and Inherit the Ancestral Dao to Transform All, charged with overseeing the affairs of Daoism throughout the realm. He was further bestowed an edict of commendation, along with appointments for Fù Déyán and Shào Qǐnán of the Supreme Clarity Palace as Teaching Assistants, and Jīn Yǒngshòu and Zhān Wàngkuí as Scribes. He was then ordered to perform prayers at Mount Tàihé.\n\nIn the third month, the emperor dispatched the Left Minor Supervisor of the Directorate of Palace Eunuchs, Wú Yóu, along with the regional governors of Jiāngxī, to reconstruct the Great Perfected One’s Residence. The project included the construction of a repository for imperial decrees to house the sacred writings of successive reigns, the establishment of the Ten Thousand Dharma Ancestral Altar in the west to venerate the Supreme Emperor and the host of perfected beings, and the renovation of the Heavenly Master’s ancestral temple in the east to honor the successive generations of perfected ones. The surrounding landscape was entirely refurbished to enhance its splendor, making it the foremost blessed land of all.\n\nThe emperor commanded the casting of bronze statues, and upon their completion, the Heavenly Master led Wú Yóu to enshrine them at the Ten Thousand Dharma Ancestral Altar. He was bestowed a silver seal for the Master of Dharma and a carved ivory seal for the transmission of the ancestral lineage. An edict was issued to the Ministry of Revenue to investigate and restore the fields and grain taxes of the Supreme Clarity Palace that had been usurped by powerful families, along with prohibitions to protect them.\n\nIn the *wùzǐ* year, he entered the capital for an audience and was commanded to assist in the sacrifices at the Altar of the Stars, receiving gifts of imperial calligraphy and silk. In the *xīnmǎo* year, he again entered the capital, but the post stations delayed his journey, causing him to arrive late. When the emperor inquired as to the reason, he truthfully explained the circumstances. The emperor ordered the investigating censors to punish the officials responsible for the negligence.\n\nIn the third month of the following year, the emperor dispatched the Left Supervisor of the Directorate of Palace Eunuchs, Cáo Yù, along with the regional governors, to reconstruct the Great Supreme Clarity Palace. In the *yǐwèi* year, due to local officials improperly assigning corvée labor to the estates of his residence across various counties, he memorialized the throne. The Ministry of Revenue was ordered to deliberate, exempting him in accordance with the privileges of a first-rank official. The decision was approved, and the exemption was established as a permanent decree.\n\nIn the *dīngyǒu* year, he entered the capital for an audience, but the post stations again caused delays, as before.

      "translated_text": "By imperial decree, the Grand Daoist Master Zhāng Yànxūn was appointed to oversee Daoism and journey to the capital to offer congratulations, as previous courts had repeatedly issued clear edicts. Local officials along the route were to provide all necessary support. If any failed in their duties, the investigating censors were to investigate and hold them accountable. Provincial governors who neglected to enforce this were likewise to be admonished. Henceforth, military and civil authorities were strictly ordered to comply without delay, as all relevant offices were to take note.\n\nThat winter, when no snow fell, he was commanded to perform prayers within the inner palace, and the response was immediate. The emperor was greatly pleased and bestowed upon him a golden crown, jade belt, python robe, and silver silk. In the *wùxū* year, he was ordered to conduct the Golden Register Grand Fast at the Inner Imperial Altar. Auspicious signs appeared: white cranes circled the altar, and rosy clouds cradled the sun. His rewards were increased accordingly.\n\nWhen he sought leave to return home, the emperor granted him an imperial escort to safeguard his journey. That year, he was summoned to Mount Qíyún to perform a grand rite of thanksgiving and expiation. Later, he memorialized the throne, requesting that the mountain’s Daoist priests be exempted from corvée labor and appointed as resident administrators, following the precedent of Mount Tàihé. The emperor granted the temple the name \"Palace of the Mysterious Heaven and Primordial Simplicity,\" exempted the remaining incense tax, and issued an edict for its protection.\n\nThat winter, the emperor’s mother passed away. The following year, the emperor presented him with a handwritten letter to express his grief and condolences. In the *jǐhài* year, during the first month, his heir was born in the new residence. Upon hearing the news, the emperor was overjoyed and personally inscribed a calligraphic message, along with gifts of gold and silk in celebration.\n\nIn the *gēngzǐ* year, considering the heir was still in swaddling clothes and could not easily travel far, the emperor dispatched the emissary Huáng Rúguì to convey his gracious exemption from the audience, allowing him to remain and attend to the child.\n\nIn the *xīnchǒu* year, imperial patents were conferred: his birth mother, Lady Zhū, was posthumously titled \"Mysterious Lady of Upright Gentleness and Compliant Virtue\"; his stepmother, Lady Sòng, \"Mysterious Lady of Gentle Kindness and Reverent Goodness\"; his wife, Lady Lǐ, \"Mysterious Lady of Serene Emptiness and Gentle Grace\"; his second wife, Lady Wú, \"Mysterious Lady of Peaceful Wonder and Constant Goodness\"; and Lady Liǔ, \"Mysterious Lady of Dignified Grace and Aspiring Dao.\"\n\nThat year, he was ordered to ordain five hundred Daoist priests, with official certificates issued by the Ministry of Rites. The emperor specially instructed the Governor of Jiāngxī, the Censor-in-Chief, to strictly prohibit fraudulent issuance of talismans by rogue commoners in Fǔzhōu.\n\nIn the *jǐyǒu* year, he was summoned to escort his heir to the capital for an audience. When their boat reached Qiántáng, the riverbed was clogged with silt, causing hardship for the people. He cast a talisman into the water, and the obstruction immediately cleared. Upon reaching Xúzhōu, the river’s flow dwindled, and the boat ran aground. He composed a poem and cast it into the water:\n\n*\"Beneath the Lǚliáng Rapids, swift as flight,*\n*A sacred isle connects to ancient Xú’s height.*\n*I pray for three feet of crimson tide,*\n*To bear the imperial barge safe to the capital’s side.\"*\n\nThat night, the waters suddenly rose, and they reached the capital gates without further delay. The emperor sent the eunuch Gāo Zhōng to welcome and convey his gratitude, bestowing upon the heir a python robe, jade belt, gold, and silk. The following day, he was summoned for an audience and hosted at a banquet in the side hall of the palace. He was commanded to compile and present the names of past Daoist masters for the emperor’s review. Soon after, an imperial letter was granted, naming his heir *Yǒngxù*.\n\nLater, he requested retirement, which the emperor approved. He took leave and returned home. In the *gēngxū* year, during the eleventh month, he dreamed of wandering Mount Tài. On the sixteenth day of the month, at dawn, he arose, bathed, and changed his robes. Then, burning incense and resting his head upon his arm, he passed away at the age of seventy-one. When the emperor heard the news, he lamented without end.",

      "translated_text": "An imperial edict granted him posthumous honors in accordance with the rites for marquises, dispatching emissary Li Qi and Brocade Guard commander Wang Zhengyi to convey condolences, oversee the funeral rites, and arrange the burial. His tomb was established at the former Dieshan Academy in Yiyang County—a singular honor. The forty-ninth Heavenly Master, named Yongxu, styled Yun Cheng and also known by the sobriquet Sanyang, was born after his father, Zhanran, dreamed of an armored warrior presenting a calling card inscribed with nine characters: \"Sanyang, General.\" The card bore no further name, and as a sudden gust of wind carried it away, he awoke. The next day, Yongxu was born.\n\nFrom an early age, he mastered the esoteric classics and practiced both scholarship and swordsmanship. When venturing out, he wore a sword and roamed mountains and marshes; when at home, he shut his door, refusing all visitors and disdaining social niceties, as if scorning the world. In the *jiyou* year of the Jiajing reign, he accompanied his father to court. Upon reaching the capital, the emperor sent eunuch Gao Zhong to bestow robes and a jade belt. The following day, he was summoned to an inner palace audience, where he received graded rewards and was hosted at a banquet in the side hall. An edict then conferred upon him the titles *Zhengyi Sijiao Shouxuan Yangsu Zunfan Chongdao Da Zhenren* (Perpetual Inheritor of the Orthodox Unity Teachings, Guardian of the Mysteries, Cultivator of Simplicity, Exemplar of the Dao, Great Perfected One), entrusting him with oversight of all Daoist affairs throughout the realm. The emperor further arranged his marriage to the daughter of Duke Dingguo, Xu Yande, with Duke Chengguo Zhu Xizhong and Earl Sui’an Chen Biao presiding over the wedding rites.\n\nIn the *renzi* year, he presented himself at court, where the emperor dispatched eunuch Huang Jin of the Directorate of Ceremonial to decree that Heavenly Master Zhang Yongxu be granted the rank of earl, with ceremonial robes for court audiences and regular sacrifices. The Ministry of Rites and Ministry of Works were further ordered to craft and present official regalia to elevate his standing in the court hierarchy. In the spring of the *guichou* year, another imperial decree reaffirmed the marriage, and after the ceremony, he was escorted back to the mountains under official guard. The Ministry of War was instructed to issue additional post station warrants beyond the usual quota to ensure a smooth journey. In the *yimao* year, he petitioned for funds to rebuild the Zhengyi, Jingying, and Xiangfu Observatories, as the allocated budget proved insufficient. The emperor approved additional funding to complete the project.\n\nIn the winter of the *wuwu* year, he returned to court. The emperor inquired, \"How has your father’s health and diet been of late?\" Yongxu replied, \"My father and I have been bathed in Your Majesty’s boundless grace, and our entire household enjoys the blessings of peace. Yet my father, sensing his strength wane like an old hound’s, has often exhorted me to strive for repayment, never daring to forget Your Majesty’s favor even for a moment.\" The emperor asked, \"But does your father still hope to return to court?\" After bestowing a banquet, Yongxu was dismissed.\n\nThat year, an edict ordered local officials to exempt the Zhengyi lineage from all miscellaneous taxes and levies, while the Ministry of War was instructed to issue travel permits under the new regulations, ensuring the provision of horses, swift boats, and strict enforcement to prevent delays or disrespect. Later, he was summoned for another audience and hosted at a banquet in the side hall. The emperor commanded him to conduct a grand *jiao* ritual for the protection of the state and the people at the Chaotian Palace, bestowing upon him a python robe and jade belt. On the thirteenth day of the first lunar month the following year, the emperor sent eunuch Zhao Xian with an urgent decree, urging him to return home early to ease his father’s longing. Thus, without awaiting the conclusion of the grand ceremony, he took leave and departed.\n\nIn the winter of the *jiazi* year, he returned to court, where the emperor summoned him to the Western Gardens for an audience, bestowing a banquet and gifts including a python robe and jade belt. On New Year’s Day of the *yichou* year, the emperor specially dispatched a eunuch to command that he precede all other ministers in entering the side hall for an audience. Afterward, he was hosted at a banquet alongside seven officials, including Grand Secretary Xu Jie, with the Heavenly Master seated at the head of the table. He conducted a *jiao* ritual within the palace and was further entrusted with presiding over the spring prayer ceremonies. Upon their completion, he urgently requested to return to the mountains. While his boat paused at Yanling Rapids, he suddenly rose, pushed open the cabin window, and gazed at the evening glow over the mountains. After a long moment, he spoke:\n\n*\"Nine by nine, nine,*\n*Homeward bound—how many peaks divide us?*\n*Green remains, yet nothing endures.*\n*At Dinghu, the fire-dragon’s whiskers shall fall,*\n*But I ride the golden ox ahead.\"*\n\nShortly after, he added:\n\n*\"Do not grieve when you turn back in the dark,*\n*For at dawn, the sun still rises as before.\"*\n\nHis voice trailed off, leaving all present astonished. He then instructed the boatman to hasten onward. He returned home not long after and passed away.",

He took leave and returned home. In the *gēngxū* year, during the eleventh month, he dreamed of wandering Mount Tài. On the sixteenth day of the month, at dawn, he arose, bathed, and changed his robes. Then, burning incense and resting his head upon his arm, he passed away at the age of seventy-one. When the emperor heard the news, he lamented without end.",

      "translated_text": "Upon receiving the report of his wife Lady Xu’s passing, the Emperor was deeply grieved and bestowed posthumous honors in accordance with the rank of a count, dispatching the emissary Yao Guangfu to convey imperial condolences and oversee the burial site at Lion Lane. A shrine was established at the Southern Dipper Abbey, and Lady Xu was posthumously enfeoffed as the Serene Harmony Primordial Sovereign. The Emperor further issued an edict sternly admonishing all clan members against any disrespect or mistreatment. Such was the profound imperial favor, the care extended to preserve and perpetuate the esoteric lineage, that the ancestral heritage might endure and the clan’s prestige be forever upheld.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: *\"Manifest the Dao, divine the power of virtue, and conduct oneself accordingly—thus may one commune with the spirits and receive their protection.\"* That which fills heaven and earth, enduring from antiquity to the present without cease, is the Dao. To make the Dao manifest is to reveal its wondrous efficacy, aligning with virtue, so that one may respond to all transformations and aid the spirits in their work—this is what it means to assist in the transformation and nurturing of heaven and earth.\n\nSima Qian observed: *\"The Daoists practice non-action, concentrate their spirit, and move in harmony with the formless. They suffice for all things, adapt to the times, respond to change, establish customs, and undertake affairs—nothing is beyond their scope.\"* How true this is.\n\nThe Most High Lord was born in the Yin dynasty and served as the Keeper of Archives for the Zhou. Later, as the Historian Beneath the Pillar, he descended to the world in an unfathomable divine transformation, becoming the patriarch of the esoteric teaching. Our ancestor, the Han Celestial Master, inheriting the legacy of the Marquis of Liu, personally received the Dao from the Most High. Thus, the cavern-classics and hidden esoterica, long untransmitted, were fully revealed to the world. Thereafter, he subdued demons and malevolent spirits, refined the elixir of immortality, and upon achieving transcendence, passed down the sword and seal through successive generations—a tradition now spanning fifteen hundred years. Though dynasties have changed and the world transformed, the succession has never faltered. Is this not because the teaching of purity and non-action, its wondrous efficacy aligned with the virtue of heaven, suffices to assist in the transformation and nurturing of all things?\n\nTo this day, in every renowned mountain and sacred retreat, the numinous traces remain. From this, one may see how the descendants’ far-reaching renown and enduring glory are indeed the result of their subtle harmonization with the imperial order and their boundless beneficence toward the people.\n\nFrom the end of the Han onward, those dwelling on Dragon-Tiger Mountain lived in seclusion among cliffs and valleys, cultivating and refining themselves to prolong their years. By the early Song, their Daoist practice began to earn renown in their time. During the Daoguan and Chongning eras, the Vacuous Tranquility True Lord emerged, his divine efficacy and wondrous responses fully realized in the practice of refining form through qi. Thereafter, his legacy flourished, matching the achievements of his predecessors.\n\nAmong those who followed, none surpassed my great-great-grandfather, the Master of Misty Mountain, and my great-grandfather, the Master of Supreme Mystery. Their illustrious deeds in prayer and supplication, their unparalleled favor from the throne—such marvels and blessings were so abundant that even the most eminent scholar-officials revered them, a reverence perhaps unmatched by earlier generations.\n\nIn our dynasty, my late father, the Master of Profound Emptiness, lived in an era of sagely brilliance and universal peace. His towering virtue and majestic prestige shone brightly in his time, his honors enduring from beginning to end—how could the past compare? Such must be the legacy of those born of divine lineage.\n\nI, Yu Chu, unworthy and mediocre, have been entrusted with continuing the ancestral legacy. Yet I tremble at the weight of this responsibility, ever fearful of falling short of the imperial grace bestowed upon me. Moreover, the history of our clan has not been fully recorded for posterity, and I worry that omissions may persist. In earlier years, my late father entrusted me with an old manuscript, which I presented to the eminent Daoist Fu Tongxu. Later, I sought a preface from the Grand Historian Song Lian, but the work remained unedited and unpublished. The original text was verbose and inelegant, so I took the liberty of revising and expanding it before committing it to print, thereby fulfilling my father’s wishes.\n\nAlas, the principle of all things is that they flourish and decline. To carry forward the past and open the way for the future is no easy task. Since the recent decline, many have abandoned substance for superficiality, competing for power and profit. If one cannot attain mastery in the teachings, radiate the brilliance of virtue, and guide one’s clan, how can they be said to have inherited the legacy of their forebears? Such understanding is beyond them.\n\nThe transmission from the Most High was one of exalted virtue and monumental achievements, its perpetuity assured. What made this possible? It is the divine and luminous nature of the Dao, which resides in the person. Those who come after must strive to emulate this, ensuring that the teachings are expounded and upheld, lest they fall into oblivion.\n\nThis work is titled *Genealogy* in the manner of historical records.\n\nRespectfully inscribed by the forty-third-generation Celestial Master, Yu Chu, with a hundred bows.\n\nOn an auspicious day of the Lantern Festival in the thirty-fifth year of the Wanli reign of the Great Ming, the year *dingwei*, the fifty-first-generation descendant Guoxiang, the Perfected One of Concentrated Sincerity, Inheritor of the Orthodox Teaching, Expounder of the Mysteries, and Grand Master for the Propagation of the Dao, entrusted by imperial decree with overseeing all Daoist affairs, supervised the carving of the printing blocks.\n\n*Genealogy of the Han Celestial Masters, Volume Four* concludes.",
