  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Cavern-Spirit Heavenly Lord’s Scripture of Dispelling Demons and Protecting the State**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Cavern-Spirit Heavenly Lord’s Scripture of Dispelling Demons and Protecting the State*\n*Author unknown, approximately composed between the Tang and Song dynasties. Three scrolls in total.*\n\nThe upper scroll attributes its teachings to the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, who expounds to the Perfected of the Limitless the methods for dispelling calamities and protecting the state. The middle and lower scrolls attribute their teachings to the Supreme Lord Lao, who reveals to the Perfected Yin Xi the Daoist registers, fasts, and rituals, exhorting people to cultivate the Heaven-Uniting Fast to dispel calamities and safeguard blessings.\n\n**Source of the Base Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity*, Cavern-Spirit Section, Textual Category.\n\n---\n\n### *The Supreme Cavern-Spirit Heavenly Lord’s Scripture of Dispelling Demons and Protecting the State, Scroll One*\n\n#### **Chapter One: The Liberation of Beings**\n\nAt that time, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, together with the Heavenly Emperors of the myriad heavens, the Perfected of the Ten Directions, the Great Sages of the Limitless, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the hosts of great sages who have attained the Dao in the ten directions, jade lads and jasper maidens, the Three Supreme Masters, and the attendant hosts of perfected beings, were expounding the Dao within the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Jade Capital Mountain in the Mysterious Metropolis, broadly liberating all beings.\n\nAt that moment, the radiance of the sun and moon illuminated the world, and heaven and earth were at peace. The Celestial Worthy emitted a five-colored light that suffused the limitless worlds of the myriad heavens, reaching upward to the Thirty-Two Heavens and downward to the dark hells of the netherworld. The divine radiance shone universally, aiding boundless beings, causing those in darkness and light alike to attain tranquility, receive manifold joys, and suffer no illness or harm. Heavenly incense wafted everywhere, and auspicious winds spread far and wide. The hungry feasted on golden rice, the thirsty drank jade nectar, and starving ghosts and destitute souls were all sated. Their spirit-souls transcended their karmic retribution, hells were pacified, and the ranks of immortals gradually ascended. Swiftly they escaped suffering, beheld the Celestial Worthy face-to-face, and ascended to the Land of Florescence, dwelling eternally in the Dharma assembly.\n\nAt that time, among the assembly was a perfected being named Limitless, who rose from his seat, draped in a cloud-embroidered robe, holding a jade blossom. Having adjusted his attire and cap, he respectfully performed the rites. When the rites were complete, he knelt in profound reverence and, bowing his head, addressed the Celestial Worthy, saying:\n\n“By the fortune of past blessings, your servant has been permitted to attend this assembly. I have heard the golden words of the Celestial Worthy unfolding the wondrous gate, causing all beings in the great earth—both hidden and manifest—to attain peace. Yet I now observe that in the lands below, the people suffer myriad evils: some are afflicted by floods, some by fires, some by famine, some by bandits, some by epidemics, some by great droughts. The five grains do not ripen, grasses and trees wither and die, the borders of the state are unsettled, and the people live in fear. The weight of these karmic burdens grieves my heart. I wish to save them, but lack the means. Thus, I now vow to deliver and govern all beings. I implore the lofty perfected ones to graciously bestow their methods, for the utility of the Dao begins with nurturing life. I beg to aid all beings and free them from these calamities.”\n\nThen the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning spoke to the Perfected Limitless, saying:\n\n“Excellent! Excellent! You now can make a great vow for all beings in the great earth, undertaking vast beneficence. With utmost sincerity, you seek to deliver and protect them, freeing them from calamities. The merit of benefiting beings is profound and far-reaching!\n\nI now command the Nine Heavens’ Generalissimo of the Three Realms, the Generals of the Three and Five, the Divine Generals of the Six Jia, the Heavenly Soldiers and Mighty Warriors, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the Perfected of Compassion, the Perfected of Jade Purity, the Perfected of the Cavern Sovereign, the hosts of hundreds of millions, the twenty myriad Jade Purity Divine Lads, the Heavenly Numinous Red Officials, the Merit Officers and Registrars, the Longevity Marshals, the eight million hosts of Lord Han the Elder, the thirty myriad hosts of heavenly and earthly immortals, the myriad hosts of the Divine Kings of the Mighty Sword, the Subduer of Poisons, the Dispeller of Demons, the Devourer of Evils, the Vanquisher of Demons, the Flying Immortal Divine Kings, the Three Masters of Precepts, and the gods of thunder, lightning, wind, and rain—to traverse the world and deliver beings from all calamities.\n\nFor all beings who encounter the perils of water or fire, if they but concentrate their minds and sincerely pray, reciting this scripture, they shall be saved. If they encounter bandits or thieves, let them recite this scripture. If they suffer epidemics, let them recite this scripture. If they face great droughts, let them recite this scripture. If the state’s borders are unsettled, let them recite this scripture. If the five grains do not ripen, let them recite this scripture. If ten thousand affairs are discordant, let them recite this scripture.\n\nThose who transcribe and venerate this scripture shall naturally attract the Nine Heavens’ Generalissimo of the Three Realms, the Generals of the Three and Five, the Divine Generals of the Six Jia, the Heavenly Soldiers and Mighty Warriors, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the Perfected of Compassion, Jade Purity, and the Cavern Sovereign, the Jade Purity Divine Lads, the Merit Officers and Registrars, the Longevity Marshals, the heavenly and earthly immortals, the Divine Kings of the Mighty Sword, the Dispeller of Demons, the Subduer of Poisons, the Devourer of Evils and Ghosts, the Vanquisher of Demons, the Collector of Pestilences, the Flying Immortal Divine Kings, the Three Masters of Precepts, the Lords of Wind and Rain, and the Duke of Thunder and Mother of Lightning. With a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, they shall descend from the void, gathering at the place where the scripture is recited, bestowing boundless blessings.\n\nAll malign poisons shall be dispelled, all evil bandits shall scatter and disperse, all epidemic toxins shall naturally vanish, floods and fires shall spontaneously cease, unsettled borders shall attain peace, the four barbarians shall submit, foreign states shall come to pay tribute, epidemics and illnesses shall be cured, quarrels and disputes shall end, official oppression and fetters shall swiftly be undone, and the bonds of karmic retribution shall be severed. Demons and evils shall not arise.”\n\nThen the Perfected Limitless again addressed the Celestial Worthy, saying:\n\n“Within the world, all beings frequently suffer from scorching droughts and such tormenting heat. What methods may be employed to bring harmonious winds and rains, ensuring the abundant ripening of the five grains?”\n\nThe Celestial Worthy spoke to the Perfected Limitless, saying:\n\n“You must now receive my teachings and practice them diligently. You may establish an altar on a high mountain, by a riverbank, before a cavern or cliff, in a pure and secluded place, within a Daoist abbey, or in a household. Install the honored images, hang banners and canopies, five-colored pennants, and variegated jeweled parasols. Light lamps, burn incense, bathe, and observe the fast. Offer various flowers and fruits, widely expound the teachings, and establish the altar. Recite the scripture and perform the ritual circumambulation, making grand offerings to the Three Pure Ones, the Supreme Sages, the Great Heavenly Emperor of Jade Purity, the Limitless Celestial Worthies of the Numinous Treasure in the Ten Directions, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors, the Heavenly Father and Earthly Mother, the Three Officials and Five Emperors, the Nine Heavens and Five Bushels, the Nine Luminaries and hosts of stars, and all the immortals and numinous officials, along with the dragon spirits.\n\nBy undertaking such vast beneficence, the Celestial Worthy shall dispatch the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, the Great Demons of the Five Directions, the Lords of Wind and Rain, to stir thunder and move mists, circling the world. In an instant, winds and rains shall answer the prayers, and rivers, streams, and gullies—both high and low fields—shall be universally moistened. Grasses, trees, and forests, all flowers, fruits, and grains shall flourish, their branches and leaves luxuriant.”\n\nThe Primordial Celestial Worthy then proclaimed this hymn of praise:\n\nThe northern winds drift and sigh,\nThe western clouds gather in solemn array.\nThe southern vermilion phoenix takes flight,\nThe eastern nine dragons hover and sway.\n\nTrue persons bear the celestial talismans,\nCommanding the rains and thunders of heaven.\nThey descend to shield the peaks of Kunlun,\nUniversally moistening all suffering sprouts.\n\nAt that time, the Boundless Perfected One again addressed the Celestial Worthy, saying: \"From kalpas without measure, I have rarely encountered such an occasion. Today, I have heard this wondrous and subtle scripture, and witnessed the salvation of all beings through transformations beyond conception. By what name should this sutra be called, and how should we, your disciples, receive and uphold it?\"\n\nThe Celestial Worthy replied: \"This sutra shall be named *The Supreme Numinous Treasure Scripture of the Celestial Lord for Dispelling Demons and Protecting the Realm: The Chapter of Liberation*. You should diligently propagate it, reverently receive it upon your crown, and hold it in utmost esteem. Should any foolish person treat it with disdain, they shall fall into the evil destinies and suffer in the long night.\"\n\nAt that moment, the assembled hosts of heavenly beings and immortals all received the scripture, paid homage, and departed.\n\nHere ends the first scroll of *The Supreme Cavernous Divine Scripture of the Celestial Lord for Dispelling Demons and Protecting the Realm*.\nHere begins the second scroll of *The Supreme Cavernous Divine Scripture of the Celestial Lord for Dispelling Demons and Protecting the Realm*.\n\n**Chapter Two: Responding to the Moment**\n\nAt that time, the Most High Lord Lao sat in the Numinous Treasure Hall of the Great Clarity’s immortal realm, leaning upon his armrest and holding a jade whisk, expounding the Dao to deliver humankind. The Perfected One Yin Xi, the immortals of the ten directions, and jade maidens with golden lads bearing tablets and incense stood in attendance to his left and right.\n\nThen, the Chamberlain of the Golden Gate at the Crown led forth a numinous official, who bore a vermilion text in a blue-green case. Before the Jasper Pool, they presented their memorial, and upon its completion, offered up the case before withdrawing in reverent haste.\n\nThereupon, the Perfected One Yin Xi stepped forward, made obeisance, and addressed Lord Lao, saying: \"I, Xi, have attended upon the Most High to this day, and at every assembly of the immortals, when the hosts of heaven present their memorials, there are always true portents. Yet just now, I saw the Chamberlain of the Golden Gate lead a numinous official to the Jasper Pool, where they presented their memorial and offered up a case before withdrawing in haste. I, dull and slow of wit, humbly beseech your sagely compassion to deign to explain this.\"\n\nLord Lao replied: \"You have asked well, and I shall respond to the moment. This concerns Wang Fajin, a disciple of the Golden Elixir from Linjin County in Jianzhou, who wears the registers and practices the Dao. He performed the Numinous Treasure Celestial Lord’s ritual fast, reciting scriptures and bowing in homage day and night, his merits and memorials borne aloft by flying dragon couriers to reach the Crown Gate. Thus did the Chamberlain of the Golden Gate follow protocol to present him.\"\n\nLord Lao continued: \"The Celestial Lord’s fast originates from the nine grades of ritual fasts for petitions and thanksgiving. It is through this that faithful men and women in the world awaken to the great Dao’s generation and transformation, moved by the heavens’ covering and the earth’s bearing. The Three Primes illumine above, the Five Phases nourish below; cold and heat alternate, water and fire harmonize. The benefits of the five soils are apportioned, the seasons’ rhythms followed. Above, the celestial perfected are revered; below, the young and old are nurtured. The household prospers in joy, all things follow their will; divine spirits guard the gates, and malevolent spirits hide in retreat.\n\nOn the six fast days and ten auspicious months, an auspicious time is chosen, the dwelling purified, and the ritual space arranged to mirror heaven and earth. Images are hung, banners displayed, and the altar established. At its center are the Three Clarities and the Jade Emperor; next, the perfected of the ten directions, the Five Emperors of the Five Directions, the Three Primes and Three Officials, the Thirty-Two Heavens, the Heavenly Sovereign and Earthly Queen, the hosts of heaven and constellations, the immortals of the Three Realms, the Lords of Wind and Rain, the Duke of Thunder and Mother of Lightning, the Year-Star Spirit of Void-Space Surveillance, the Celestial Worthies, Fuxi and Shennong, the Gods of Soil and Grain, the Treasuries of Wealth, the Guardians of Life and Longevity, the great mountains and rivers, the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, the Four Duty Envoys, the local earth spirits and numinous officials, the Memorial-Supervising Officers, and the guardians of the ritual space.\n\nThe household purifies itself, and with utmost sincerity, they invite Orthodox Unity or Three Caverns masters—three, five, or seven in number—for one or three days. Seasonal fruits, tea, wine, incense, flowers, aquatic plants, and pure offerings are prepared, along with ritual cloths, silver coins, cloud-horses, life-grain, and patterned silks. Lamps are lit, incense burned, and the Dao is practiced according to the rites. When the altar rites conclude, merits are proclaimed, and the perfected are rewarded. Memorials and petitions are presented, beseeching blessings. These are entrusted to the Four Duty Envoys, who convey the petitions, while the numinous officials, memorial-supervising officers, and courier dragon riders transmit the documents aloft to the Three Clarities. The Three Clarities record the merits, promote goodness, and issue edicts to the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, the Examiners of the Five Emperors, the local immortal officials, the city gods and earth spirits, the Directors of Destiny and Registrars, and the local earth gods. All receive the celestial talismans and surround the site of the fast, and for this reason, such manifestations occur.\"\n\nThe Perfected One Yin Xi and the assembled immortals bowed in gratitude and again addressed Lord Lao, saying: \"The Numinous Treasure Celestial Lord’s fast indeed evokes wondrous responses, profound beyond measure. Yet we remain ignorant of its origins—how did this fast come to be? We, dull and unenlightened, wish to hear your sagely words.\"\n\nLord Lao replied: \"Long ago, while dwelling in the realm of the Three Clarities, I observed that all beings in the world had grown dissolute with the times, the great simplicity gradually scattering. The common people had lost the Dao, and perverse winds flourished. They disrespected the Two Modes, despised wind and rain, scorned the hundred grains, and squandered silk and cotton. They were unfilial and unkind, unbenevolent and unjust, devoted to heterodox teachings, and wantonly sacrificed to ghosts and spirits. They envied the worthy and resented the capable, were miserly, greedy, and lustful, failed to honor the great Dao, and harmed creatures, injuring life. Thus did ghosts and spirits grow harmful in their excess, heaven and earth send down calamities, floods and fires follow one another, the five grains fail to flourish, pestilence spread, and plague demons arise in competition. The myriad people suffered in misery, blaming heaven and resenting earth. Moved by compassion for beings who did not comprehend sin and fortune, I expounded the thirty-six revered scriptures, unfolded the Three Caverns’ numinous talismans, established the nine grades of ritual fasts, and set forth the nine-cycled elixir formulas, enabling all beings to awaken to the Dao through the scriptures, dispel evil by wearing the registers, summon the perfected through fasting, cultivate truth and refine conduct, return to the true, attain the Dao, and thereby attain long life.\n\nThe thirty-six revered scriptures comprise the Twelve Divisions of the Numinous Treasure Cavern of Truth, the Twelve Divisions of the Numinous Treasure Cavern of Mystery, and the Twelve Divisions of the Numinous Treasure Cavern of Spirit—thirty-six divisions in all, totaling 1,884,220 scrolls.\n\nThe Twelve Divisions of the Cavern of Truth expound the Dao of heaven and earth’s creation, the ebb and flow of yin and yang, the nine-cycled return of the elixir, the golden liquid’s refinement of form, and the flight of immortals.\n\nThe Twelve Divisions of the Cavern of Mystery expound the Dao of dispelling calamities, curing illnesses, repenting transgressions, and praying for exorcism, delivering and uplifting the living and the dead.\n\nThe Twelve Divisions of the Cavern of Spirit expound the Dao of governing the state, managing the household, and cultivating the self.\n\nThe Three Caverns’ numinous talismans are those of the Highest Clarity, the Middle Methods, and the Orthodox Unity.\n\nThe nine grades of ritual fasts comprise twenty-seven types: the Grand Perfected Fast, the Golden Register Fast, the Jade Register Fast, the Illuminating Truth Fast, the Natural Fast, the Yellow Register Fast, the Three Primes Fast, the Suffering Fast, the Cavern of Spirit Fast, the Divine Incantation Fast, the Nine Heavens Fast, the Instruction Fast, the Orthodox Unity Fast, the Celestial Treasure Fast, the Nine Dark Realms Fast, the Five Refinements Fast, the Great Peace Fast, the Great One Fast, the Eight Emperors Fast, the Three Sovereigns Fast, the Highest Clarity Fast, the Great Cavern Fast, the Golden Chamber Fast, the Northern Emperor Fast, the Five Emperors Fast, the Huahua Fast, the Numinous Treasure Fast, and the Celestial Lord Fast—each practiced in accordance with the occasion.\"\n\nThe Golden Register, Jade Register, and Nine Heavens Fasts are the fasts of emperors and kings, not to be practiced by ministers or commoners. The Yellow Register Fast broadly delivers the three paths of suffering, extending its blessings to all beings, and aids both the living and the deceased. The Numinous Treasure Celestial Lord Fast bears the great Dao’s generative power, repays the heavens and earth for their nurturing embrace, resolves the transgressions of all living beings, invokes future blessings and felicity, prays for timely winds and rains, abundant harvests of the hundred grains, the elimination of plagues and poisons, and the bestowal of fortune and longevity. Those who undertake this fast must purify their thoughts and concentrate their spirit, offering sincere devotion—then blessings and virtue will descend as swiftly as an echo answers sound.\n\nAt that time, Lord Lao addressed Yin Xi again, saying: \"Formerly, our ancestral master, the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy, dwelled in the Three Clarities with the Jade Dawn Great Dao Lord. Observing the eighty-one kingdoms of the Western Regions, such as Khotan, which partake of the qi of western metal essence—foul in odor, fierce in nature, indulging in lust and delighting in slaughter, wantonly harming living beings, neither rulers nor ministers, neither fathers nor sons—their cruelty was boundless, their karmic transgressions ever deepening. I received the golden words of the Primordial Great Dao, commanding me to transform the Hu in the Western Regions. Arriving at the Hangu Pass, where you served as the pass officer, I saw that your nature and destiny aligned with the Dao, and your devotion to the true was unwavering. Thus, I bestowed upon you the Golden Elixir. After a thousand days of cultivation, we were to meet at the Green Sheep Market in Great Shu, where you would ascend to heaven in broad daylight. Traversing the Nine Heavens, you would pay homage to the Jade Emperor. Though you attained the Dao, you have yet to comprehend the subtle and wondrous transformations of the Primordial Great Dao. You must now listen with utmost sincerity, for I shall explain it to you.\n\nBefore heaven and earth divided, before the sun and moon shone, before the stars spread forth, before the myriad things took form—vast and boundless, chaotic and obscure—there was the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, born before heaven and earth, without ancestor or lineage, coalescing alone, nameless and formless, subtly wondrous and profoundly penetrating, endlessly transforming, fathomless in depth. He then generated the primordial qi, which nurtured the Five Agents. The Five Agents gave rise to one another, and thus heaven and earth came into being. Once heaven and earth were separated, movement and stillness took shape. Thus, heaven received the pure qi, ascending and congealing above; earth received the turbid qi, descending and solidifying below; the harmonious qi in between transformed and gave birth to the myriad spirits.\n\nThe sun arose from yang essence, the moon from yin spirit. The Eastern Dipper was established in the east, where the Five Agents correspond to wood, governing the spring’s generation. The Southern Dipper was set in the south, where the Five Agents correspond to fire, governing the summer’s growth and nourishment. The Western Dipper was arrayed in the west, where the Five Agents correspond to metal, governing the autumn’s harvest and ripening. The Northern Dipper was erected in the north, where the Five Agents correspond to water, governing the winter’s storage and preservation. The Central Dipper was arranged in the center, where the Five Agents correspond to earth, governing the four seasons, for all things depend on earth to transform and generate naturally. Once the Five Dippers were arrayed, the stars took their positions. How could the celestial patterns be mere ornament? They manifest the Dao of water, fire, metal, and the Golden Elixir—those who perceive it flourish.\"\n\nThen Lord Lao offered this hymn of praise:\n\"Before heaven and earth,\nThe Primordial Supreme Immortal.\nWithout lineage or ancestor,\nAlone he coalesced.\nNurturing the primordial qi,\nThe Five Agents came first.\nTurbid qi became earth,\nPure qi became heaven.\nHarmonious qi became humankind,\nScattered as mountains and rivers.\nStars arrayed in order,\nSun and moon hung on high.\nWood Star in the east,\nMetal Star in the west.\nNorthern Dipper in the Kan position,\nSouthern Dipper in the Li.\nSpring, summer, autumn, winter,\nSequentially they shift.\nMetal born of water,\nLinked with wood.\nFire gives rise to earth,\nMutually opposing, mutually cherishing.\nNine returns, seven reversals,\nMatched in the heavens.\nThose who perceive it flourish,\nThose who refine it become immortals.\nThe profound Dao is wondrous,\nMysterious and ever more mysterious.\"\n\nLord Lao said: \"The Primordial Heavenly Worthy generated the Three Qi from the One Qi, and the Three Qi generated the Nine Qi. The Three Qi are the Mysterious, the Primordial, and the Originative. From the qi of the Mysterious One, the Jade Clarity Sacred Realm of the Great Luo Heaven was transformed—its jasper towers and jeweled halls, the Mysterious Capital and Jade Metropolis, the Purple Tenuity Palace, where the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy resides, known as the Dragon Han Kalpa. From the qi of the Primordial One, the Upper Clarity True Realm of the Yu Yu Heaven was transformed—its jade towers and jeweled halls, forests of treasure trees, where the Jade Dawn Great Dao Lord resides, known as the Red Brightness Middle Kalpa. At that time, the Most High Dao Lord was the disciple of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy. The Primordial Heavenly Worthy, within the Beginning Azure Heaven, summoned the boundless sacred hosts of the ten directions to the Treasure Grove, where they received the transmission of the Dao and its teachings.\n\nFrom the qi of the Originative One, the Grand Clarity Immortal Realm was transformed—its pearl towers and golden palaces, halls of the seven treasures, where I reside, known as the Kaihuang Present Kalpa. I, in turn, was the disciple of the Jade Dawn Great Dao Lord. These Three Clarities and Three Sages each arose through the transformation of a kalpa, known as the Three Clarities’ Upper Realm, the Great Luo Heaven’s Mysterious Capital and Jade Metropolis.\n\nMoreover, the Three Qi each generated Three Qi, transforming into Nine Qi, which formed the Nine Heavens. Beyond the Three Clarities, the Nine Heavens were arrayed, where the Nine Heavenly Lords reside. The titles of the Nine Heavenly Immortals are:\nFirst, the Boundless Joy Heaven of Yudan;\nSecond, the Upper Superior Meditation Heaven of Endless Life;\nThird, the Brahma Supervisor Heaven of Xuyan;\nFourth, the Serene and Silent Heaven of Doushu;\nFifth, the Joyous and Unarrogant Heaven of Pāramitā;\nSixth, the Responsive Transformation Heaven of Dongyuan;\nSeventh, the Numinous Transformation Heaven of Brahma’s Assistants;\nEighth, the Lofty and Void Heaven of Clarity;\nNinth, the Heaven of No Thought, No Attachment, No Desire.\n\nBeyond the Nine Heavens lie the Thirty-Two Heavens, where the Thirty-Two Heavenly Lords reside. The titles of the Eight Eastern Heavens are:\nGreat August Yellow Radiance Heaven,\nGreat Brightness Jade Perfection Heaven,\nClarity and Brightness Haotong Heaven,\nMysterious Womb Level Nurturing Heaven,\nVoid Transcending Heng Heaven,\nGreat Ultimate Veiled Heaven,\nPrimordial Brightness Wenju Heaven,\nUpper Brightness Seven Luminaries Ma Yi Heaven.\n\nThe titles of the Eight Southern Heavens are:\nVermilion Brightness Harmonious Yang Heaven,\nMysterious Brightness Reverent Splendor Heaven,\nRadiant Brightness Ancestral Whirlwind Heaven,\nZhuoluo August Reed Heaven,\nVoid Brightness Hall of Luminaries Heaven,\nObserving Brightness Upright Serenity Heaven,\nMysterious Brightness Reverent Celebration Heaven,\nGreat Resplendence Ultimate Jade Heaven.\"\n\nThe titles of the Eight Western Heavens are:\nPrimordial Ascent Kongsheng Heaven,\nGreat Peace August Cliff Heaven,\nManifest Destiny Ultimate Wind Heaven,\nFirst August Filial Mang Heaven,\nGreat August Wengchong Furong Heaven,\nNo-Thought Jiangyou Heaven,\nUpper Divination Ruanle Heaven,\nUltimate Non-Being Tanshi Heaven.\n\nThe titles of the Eight Northern Heavens are:\nLuminous Court Xiaodu Heaven,\nAbyssal Passage Wudong Heaven,\nGreat Literature Hanchong Miaocheng Heaven,\nGreat Simplicity Xiule Jin Shang Heaven,\nGreat Void Supreme Constant Fusion Heaven,\nGreat Release Jade Dragon Ascendant Victory Heaven,\nDragon Transformation Brahman Passage Heaven,\nGreat Ultimate Level Nurturing Jiayi Heaven.\n\nThough these heavens exist, they remain bound by kalpic fate. Thereupon, the Jade Dawn Dao Lord composed the *Four Scrolls of the Numinous Writ of the Primordial Beginning*, condensing clouds into seal-script, each character a full ten feet in breadth, its eight corners trailing radiance. One scroll was placed to guard the Eight Eastern Heavens, one the Eight Southern Heavens, one the Eight Western Heavens, and one the Eight Northern Heavens, thereby preserving and restraining kalpic fate to ensure the heavens endure forever.\n\nThe Numinous Writ for the Eight Eastern Heavens reads:\nDanlou Ahui, Wuhe Guanyin.\nXuyan Mingshou, Falan Putan.\nJiana Ayu, Huhu Liuyin.\nHuadu Quli, Xianpu Yuzhen.\nTailuo Dafan, Sanyan Qingyun.\nFeisa Yudu, Mingmo Shangmen.\nWuxing Shangshou, Huizhi Liuxuan.\nAtuo Longluo, Sixiang Xuyuan.\n\nThe Numinous Writ for the Eight Southern Heavens reads:\nNanyan Dongfu, Yumou Shenxian.\nFanxing Luokong, Jiuling Weiqian.\nZeluo Puti, Lüluo Daqian.\nMiaomang Jiuchou, Shaoyao Yuanzhan.\nYunshang Jiudu, Feisheng Ziqian.\nNayu Yufu, Moluo Falun.\nHongchi Wujing, Lanzi Yunrong.\nFulang Kuoyi, Shenying Zigong.\n\nThe Numinous Writ for the Eight Western Heavens reads:\nDaoli Chanyou, Poni Joutong.\nWansou Dishe, Taimiao Zhitang.\nLiuluo Fanmeng, Jingwei Xiaoyu.\nYimiao Wuji, Wanshou Shaodu.\nAlan Yuzhu, Huamo Yanyou.\nJiukai Zibian, Anapin Shou.\nWuliang Fugai, Fuluo Heshen.\nYudan Changsang, Bokong Duxian.\n\nThe Numinous Writ for the Eight Northern Heavens reads:\nJuewu Ziyu, Jiuri Daoqian.\nKunmu Dongfu, Xingshe Shangxuan.\nTuoluo Yumiao, Miaogi Heyun.\nFeitian Dashou, Zongjian Shangtian.\nShatuo Jieliang, Longhan Yingxian.\nBiluo Fuli, Kongge Baozhen.\nEyi Wupin, Dongmiao Zizhen.\nYuanfan Huimo, Youji Duren.\n\nThus the sun and moon course through their orbits, the stars array their radiance, the Five Phases alternate in function, the Four Seasons flow in harmony. Day and night, cold and heat, the Thunder Duke and Lightning Mother, the Wind Earl and Rain Master—all ascend to follow the celestial constants, each attending to its appointed office.\n\nThe Eulogy states:\nThe Primordial Qi of the Mysterious Origin\nArises from the Dao and takes form.\nThe Three Qi transform and evolve,\nGiving birth to the Jade Capital.\nJewel palaces and jade halls,\nPrecious trees towering and grand.\nThe Lord of the Great Luo Heaven,\nDwells in the Three Clarities’ realm.\nThe Three Clarities’ ministers,\nComplete their work in three kalpas.\nThe Three Qi still extend,\nGiving rise to the Nine Heavens.\nThe Nine Heavens respond to change,\nAnd the Thirty-Two Heavens.\nPalaces of seven treasures,\nGuarded by jade scrolls.\nPreserving and restraining kalpic fate,\nEnsuring the heavens endure forever.\nThe sun and moon revolve,\nThe constellations stretch in sequence.\nThe Five Phases without flaw,\nThe Four Seasons proclaim their course.\nDay and night,\nImpartial and unbiased.\nThe Thunder Duke and Lightning Mother,\nThe Wind Earl and Rain Master,\nReverently obey Heaven’s mandate,\nEach attending to its office.\nWhen the Jade Candle is harmonized,\nAll things flourish.\nThe Dao of Heaven and Earth,\nIts merit profound and selfless.\n\nHere ends the *Central Scroll of the Most High Cavern Spirit Heavenly Lord’s Scripture on Dispelling Demons and Protecting the State*.\n\n---\n\nThe *Lower Scroll of the Most High Cavern Spirit Heavenly Lord’s Scripture on Dispelling Demons and Protecting the State*\n**Chapter Three: The Governance of All Under Heaven**\n\nThe Lord Lao said: The Heavenly Lord embodies the Heavenly Dao—impartial and selfless. The Heavenly Father and Earthly Mother are the Great Jade Emperor of Heaven. Once Heaven and Earth and the myriad things were complete, the Primordial Beginning Great Dao withdrew into non-action, and thus commanded the Jade Emperor to govern the Three Realms, to shelter and nurture all living beings with impartiality and selflessness.\n\nHe appointed the Earthly Mother as the Earthly Empress, charged the Heavenly Officials with the Celestial Bureau, the Earthly Officials with the Earthly Courts, and the Water Officials with the Watery Realms. He arrayed the Four Seas and Five Peaks, the famous mountains and great rivers, the cavern grottoes and blessed lands, each assigned to immortal officials for governance.\n\nHe further dispatched the Directors of Destiny and Registrars, the Day Patrols and Moon Circuits, the Year, Month, Day, and Hour Attendants, the Four Duty Envoys, the Void Observers, and the local Earth Gods and Mountain Spirits—all divided into offices and ranks, patrolling the world to investigate right and wrong. Thus the Son of Heaven in the human realm, emulating Heaven and Earth, established a capital in the Central Plains and distributed the Nine Provinces and Hundred Prefectures, the Four Barbarians and Eight Wild Tribes.\n\nHe appointed officials for the Four Seasons—spring, summer, autumn, and winter—along with the Three Dukes, Nine Ministers, civil and military officials, each assigned to their offices to govern all under Heaven.\n\nThe Son of Heaven is no ordinary mortal; he is endowed with the true primordial essence of the One Qi. Through successive generations, he descends to be born, as an Upper Immortal in the celestial realms or an Upper Constellation in the heavens. All receive the mandate of the Great Dao and Jade Emperor, descending in accordance with the cosmic cycles and ascending in turn—such is the celestial reckoning.\n\nTherefore, the Northern Asterism stands above while the host of stars pay homage. In the heavens, there are the Emperor’s Seat Star, the Empress and Consort Stars, the Crown Prince Star, the Princes’ Stars, the Three Terraces Stars, the Four Inner Assistants Stars, the Feudal Lords’ Stars, the Lord’s Foundation Star, the Minister’s Foundation Star, the People’s Foundation Star, the Literary Star, and the Martial Star. Below, the myriad things correspond to the myriad stars above.\n\nHeaven and Earth are truly the children of the Great Dao, and the myriad things are the grandchildren of the Great Dao. The Great Dao is the origin of Heaven and Earth, and the Two Modes are the root of the myriad things. Yin and yang ascend and descend, Heaven and Earth’s qi intermingle, and then the hundred grains are sown to universally succor all living beings. The Great Dao’s work in the cosmos is profound beyond measure, silently nurturing the myriad things without claiming virtue or benevolence. The myriad things naturally return to it, yet its merit does not presume to govern. Thus, through fasting and uprightness, one repays the grace of the Great Dao, Heaven, and Earth.\n\nPraise says:\nHeaven the Father, Earth the Mother,\nHou Tu and the Jade Emperor.\nOnce Heaven and Earth were established,\nthe Three Pure Ones withdrew and concealed themselves.\nThe Jade Emperor received the mandate,\ngoverning all directions.\nThe celestial, terrestrial, and aquatic domains—\nthe Three Officials preside over them.\nThe sacred peaks, rivers, and grotto-palaces\nare the chambers of the host of immortals.\nThe Controllers of Destiny and Record-Keepers,\nthe Sun’s procession and the Moon’s course.\nYears, months, days, and hours—\nthe Four Vigilant Deva-Kings.\nThey patrol the world below,\nrectifying and investigating inauspicious signs.\n\nThe Son of Heaven among men\nfounds states and establishes domains.\nGazing up and looking down,\nhe constructs the Hall of Light.\nModeling Heaven and emulating Earth,\nhe turns from yin and faces yang.\nThe Nine Provinces and ten thousand states,\nthe distant wilds of the Four Barbarians.\nThe Three Terraces and Four Assistants,\nthe civil and military officials.\nThey divide offices and array duties,\nthereby gathering all under Heaven.\nWithout action, without affairs,\nhe dons the crown and lets his robes hang loose.\n\nThe highest immortals and stellar lodges,\nbelow they become emperors and kings.\nReceiving Heaven’s calendar,\nabove and below know no constancy.\nThe Northern Asterism stands above,\nthe Three Terraces at its side.\nEmpresses, consorts, and crown princes,\nthe feudal lords and hundred kings.\nThe Son of Heaven, august and solemn,\nthe feudal lords, resplendent and grand.\nBelow, they nurture the myriad kinds;\nabove, they serve the azure vault.\nTheir merit reaches Heaven and Earth,\nbestowing blessings and felicity.\nClouds move and rain descends,\nuniversally moistening without bound.\nThe hundred grains yield harvest,\nthe myriad things suffer no harm.\nGreatly aiding all living beings,\ngranaries fill a thousandfold.\nThe Great Dao and Heaven and Earth—\ntheir mysterious work is measureless.\n\nThus, celestial fasts are established\nto celebrate peace and well-being.\n\nLaozi says: All people\nare born bearing the wondrous qi of the Dao and Heaven and Earth.\nThus, the head is round, emulating Heaven;\nthe feet are square, emulating Earth.\nFlesh resembles soil,\nbones resemble stone,\nqi resembles wind,\nblood resembles water.\nThe eyes resemble the sun and moon,\nhair resembles grasses and trees.\nHearing resembles the primordial caverns,\nspeech resembles thunder’s roar.\nWaking resembles day,\nsleep resembles night.\nWalking resembles clouds,\nsitting resembles mountains.\nJoy resembles clear skies,\nanger resembles rain.\nThe five viscera resemble the Five Phases,\nthe four limbs resemble the Four Qi.\nThe nine orifices resemble grottoes,\ncorresponding to the number of yang.\n\nMoreover, the four limbs, five viscera, six bowels,\nmovement and stillness, joy and anger—\nall emulate Heaven and Earth.\nAre they not born of the wondrous qi of the Dao and Heaven and Earth?\n\nLaozi says: When any being is conceived,\nHeaven sends the Controllers of Destiny and Record-Keepers\nto constantly protect and shield them.\nIf a male is born, the myriad spirits proclaim goodness;\nif a female is born, the myriad spirits chant reverence.\nTheir names are registered in the Three Origins,\nrecorded in the Supreme Emperor’s ledgers.\nThe Eastern Dipper inscribes their lifespan,\nthe Western Dipper records their name.\nThe Northern Dipper marks their death,\nthe Southern Dipper bestows life.\nThe Original Chronogram guards their destiny,\nthe Central Dipper extends their years.\nThe Great Dao gives them life,\nthe utmost virtue nurtures them.\nThe Five Phases complete them,\nHigh Heaven covers them,\nEarth’s depths bear them,\nthe sun and moon illuminate them,\nthe stars and constellations protect them,\nthe divine luminaries guard them,\nthe Four Qi propel them,\nwind and rain moisten them,\nsilk and cotton clothe them,\nhuman relationships sustain them.\nGreat music harmonizes them,\ngreat ritual restrains them,\nthe Great Lord oversees them.\nThe Great Dao and Heaven and Earth’s\nlife-giving work—how wondrous!\nHow great! How supreme!\n\nAll living beings,\nif they awaken to this,\nshould wholeheartedly revere the Dao,\ndevoutly honor Heaven and Earth, their parents,\nthe sun, moon, stars, and constellations.\nAbove, they accord with Heaven’s constancy;\nbelow, they apportion Earth’s benefits.\nFathers are kind, children filial;\nelder brothers friendly, younger brothers respectful.\nAs ministers, they are consummately loyal;\nas rulers, consummately sagely.\nThe Great Dao bestows protection,\nHeaven and Earth send down felicity.\nThey refine their forms with golden elixir,\nattaining long life and enduring vision.\n\nIf they slight and insult the Great Dao,\ndisrespect Heaven and Earth,\ndiscard and despise the five grains,\nsquander silk and cotton,\nturn from the Dao and venerate heterodoxy,\nindulge in lust and commit murder,\nrevile wind and curse rain,\nslander and defame scriptures—\nthen the Dao will not give them life,\nHeaven will not cover them,\nEarth will not bear them,\nthe sun and moon will not shine upon them,\nthe stars and constellations will not protect them,\nthe divine luminaries will not guard them,\nthe Four Qi will not propel them,\nwind and rain will not be harmonious,\nthe five grains will not nourish them,\nsilk and cotton will not clothe them,\nhuman relationships will not sustain them.\nGreat music will not harmonize them,\ngreat ritual will not restrain them,\nthe Great Lord will not oversee them.\nThey will be poor and lowly,\nafflicted by chronic illness.\nWhen their allotted karma is exhausted,\nthe Executioners will come to punish them.\nHaving departed the human realm,\nthey will sink into hell,\nenduring every torment and torture,\nagonies unbearable.\nEmbracing the bronze pillar in heat,\nlying on the iron bed in cold,\nsawed by blades of gold,\nwounded by knives of iron,\nswallowing fire and eating coals—\nforever they will fall into evil destinies,\nwith no hope of escape.\n\nNow, for you and all living beings,\nI expound this wondrous scripture.\nRevere and uphold it,\ndiligently practice it.\n\nThus, the praise says:\n\nThe Great Dao encompasses Heaven and Earth,\nits principle is to give life and nurture.\nHumans and the myriad beings\nall receive the same qi.\nWhat is spoken as constant,\nwhen verified, is precious.\nThe head, round, resembles Heaven;\nthe feet, square, resemble Earth.\nFlesh is like soil, bones like stone,\nqi like wind, blood like water.\nThe voice echoes thunder,\nhair resembles grass.\nGloom and haze signify anger,\nclear skies signify joy.\nDay mirrors wakefulness,\nnight mirrors sleep.\nMovement is like drifting clouds,\nsitting like a mountain’s stillness.\nThe five viscera and four limbs\ncorrespond to the Five Phases and four qi.\nThe teeming multitudes,\ncrowned with hair and bearing teeth—\nthe Great Dao of Heaven and Earth\ngives life to you and nurtures you.\nAll living beings,\nturn inward and reflect.\n\nWhen male and female unite in essence,\nthe womb begins its work.\nThe Lords of Life and Record\nguard and bestow the spirit.\nThe father’s heavenly qi,\nthe mother’s earthly essence—\nafter ten months, the fetus emerges,\nmother and child separate in form.\nMales are born face down,\nfemales face up.\nFor males, the ten thousand spirits praise goodness;\nfor females, the ten thousand spirits delight in harmony.\nAbove, they are linked to the celestial courts;\nin the middle, to the stars.\nThe Three Primes hold their registers,\nthe Five Emperors oversee their reception.\nThe Eastern Dipper governs lifespan,\nthe Western Dipper records names.\nThe Northern Dipper marks death,\nthe Southern Dipper grants life.\nThe Original Chronogram protects destiny,\nthe Central Dipper extends longevity.\nVirtue and the Dao give life,\nHeaven and Earth shelter and sustain.\nThe Three Primes shine in alternation,\nday and night succeed each other.\nThe four seasons and Five Phases\nare relied upon by all things.\nThe five grains sustain life,\nsilk and cotton clothe the body.\nHarmonize with music,\nrestrain with ritual.\nThe Son of Heaven is majestic,\nhuman relationships flourish.\nThe Great Dao of Heaven and Earth\nis profoundly boundless in merit.\nAbove, honor father and mother;\nbelow, befriend brothers.\nEmploy the Dao of Heaven,\nand no disasters will arise.\nDiligently serve Heaven and Earth,\nand you will live long without perishing.\nAct contrary to this,\nand though you seek far, you will falter.\nPoor and lowly,\nafflicted by chronic illness and misfortune—\nwhen guilt fills and sins are fixed,\nthe Executioners will come to restrain you.\nSinking into hell,\nforever parting from the human world,\nsuffering calamities for ten thousand kalpas,\nbeyond all reckoning.\n\nLet good men and good women\nforever renounce evil intentions.\n\nLord Lao says: This scripture is most noble, the essential means for living beings to repent their transgressions, pray for blessings, and cultivate the truth. It may be recited on the days of one’s original destiny, the Four Seasons, the Eight Festivals, the Six Fasts, the Ten Straight Days, or when averting drought or flood, praying for the five grains, seeking blessings and protection, repenting transgressions to dispel misfortune, or breaking curses. According to one’s wishes, with sincere devotion, invite one, two, three, five, or seven Orthodox Unity or Three Caverns masters to build merit by reciting this scripture, performing purification rites, and practicing the Dao. Blessings and virtue will descend at once, dispelling all misfortune.\n\nOr, during the three spring months when Heaven and Earth bring forth life, or in autumn and winter when the myriad things mature, burn incense and make offerings, reciting this scripture to bear the merit of the Great Dao’s life-giving work in Heaven and Earth. Heaven hears the humble, the Dao responds to sincerity. Record these earnest prayers, and all will be granted blessings and good fortune. Its profound principles are subtle, its majesty and grace unfathomable. Revere it! Revere it!\n\nWhen performing the Heavenly Lord’s purification rites, one must fast and purify, abstain from meat and pungent foods, sweep and cleanse the dwelling. All matters must be pure and pristine. The Great Dao of Heaven and Earth observes and records sincerity. Strictly avoid using common objects, as well as items touched by mourners, pregnant women, chickens, dogs, monks, or nuns—anything impure—lest it offend the true and great Dao of Heaven. Heaven and Earth reward and punish without partiality; their responses to reverence or disrespect are irresistible.\n\nFor all purification rites and offerings, every item must be abundant. Even slight negligence will cause the Celestial Emperor to refuse them, turning blessings into misfortune. Let all men and women revere this with utmost care.\n\nThis is the Heavenly Lord’s incantation to subdue evil spirits. If faithful devotees of the Dao—good men and women—wish to practice divination, they must first burn incense, bow in reverence, and silently invoke the Three Clarities, the Perfected of Highest Heaven, the Celestial Emperors, the Heavenly Father and Earthly Mother, the Incense Officers of the Day, and the local earth deities. Then, knock the teeth three times, recite the incantation seven times, and naturally the spirits will respond, the Celestial Perfected will protect, all evil will be averted, and all sins will be erased.\n\nAfter the Most High had expounded the scripture, the Perfected Lord Yin Xi and the attendant immortals all bowed in reverence and, prostrating themselves again, diligently vowed to uphold it.\n\nThus concludes the *Highest Clarity Wondrous Scripture of the Heavenly Lord for Dispelling Demons and Protecting the State*, Scroll the Lower.",

      "translated_text": "**The Supreme Cavern-Spirit Heavenly Lord’s Scripture of Dispelling Demons and Protecting the State**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Cavern-Spirit Heavenly Lord’s Scripture of Dispelling Demons and Protecting the State*\n*Author unknown, approximately composed between the Tang and Song dynasties. Three scrolls in total.*\n\nThe upper scroll attributes its teachings to the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, who expounds to the Perfected of the Limitless the methods for dispelling calamities and protecting the state. The middle and lower scrolls attribute their teachings to the Supreme Lord Lao, who reveals to the Perfected Yin Xi the Daoist registers, fasts, and rituals, exhorting people to cultivate the Heaven-Uniting Fast to dispel calamities and safeguard blessings.\n\n**Source of the Base Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity*, Cavern-Spirit Section, Textual Category.\n\n---\n\n### *The Supreme Cavern-Spirit Heavenly Lord’s Scripture of Dispelling Demons and Protecting the State, Scroll One*\n\n#### **Chapter One: The Liberation of Beings**\n\nAt that time, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, together with the Heavenly Emperors of the myriad heavens, the Perfected of the Ten Directions, the Great Sages of the Limitless, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the hosts of great sages who have attained the Dao in the ten directions, jade lads and jasper maidens, the Three Supreme Masters, and the attendant hosts of perfected beings, were expounding the Dao within the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Jade Capital Mountain in the Mysterious Metropolis, broadly liberating all beings.\n\nAt that moment, the radiance of the sun and moon illuminated the world, and heaven and earth were at peace. The Celestial Worthy emitted a five-colored light that suffused the limitless worlds of the myriad heavens, reaching upward to the Thirty-Two Heavens and downward to the dark hells of the netherworld. The divine radiance shone universally, aiding boundless beings, causing those in darkness and light alike to attain tranquility, receive manifold joys, and suffer no illness or harm. Heavenly incense wafted everywhere, and auspicious winds spread far and wide. The hungry feasted on golden rice, the thirsty drank jade nectar, and starving ghosts and destitute souls were all sated. Their spirit-souls transcended their karmic retribution, hells were pacified, and the ranks of immortals gradually ascended. Swiftly they escaped suffering, beheld the Celestial Worthy face-to-face, and ascended to the Land of Florescence, dwelling eternally in the Dharma assembly.\n\nAt that time, among the assembly was a perfected being named Limitless, who rose from his seat, draped in a cloud-embroidered robe, holding a jade blossom. Having adjusted his attire and cap, he respectfully performed the rites. When the rites were complete, he knelt in profound reverence and, bowing his head, addressed the Celestial Worthy, saying:\n\n“By the fortune of past blessings, your servant has been permitted to attend this assembly. I have heard the golden words of the Celestial Worthy unfolding the wondrous gate, causing all beings in the great earth—both hidden and manifest—to attain peace. Yet I now observe that in the lands below, the people suffer myriad evils: some are afflicted by floods, some by fires, some by famine, some by bandits, some by epidemics, some by great droughts. The five grains do not ripen, grasses and trees wither and die, the borders of the state are unsettled, and the people live in fear. The weight of these karmic burdens grieves my heart. I wish to save them, but lack the means. Thus, I now vow to deliver and govern all beings. I implore the lofty perfected ones to graciously bestow their methods, for the utility of the Dao begins with nurturing life. I beg to aid all beings and free them from these calamities.”\n\nThen the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning spoke to the Perfected Limitless, saying:\n\n“Excellent! Excellent! You now can make a great vow for all beings in the great earth, undertaking vast beneficence. With utmost sincerity, you seek to deliver and protect them, freeing them from calamities. The merit of benefiting beings is profound and far-reaching!\n\nI now command the Nine Heavens’ Generalissimo of the Three Realms, the Generals of the Three and Five, the Divine Generals of the Six Jia, the Heavenly Soldiers and Mighty Warriors, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the Perfected of Compassion, the Perfected of Jade Purity, the Perfected of the Cavern Sovereign, the hosts of hundreds of millions, the twenty myriad Jade Purity Divine Lads, the Heavenly Numinous Red Officials, the Merit Officers and Registrars, the Longevity Marshals, the eight million hosts of Lord Han the Elder, the thirty myriad hosts of heavenly and earthly immortals, the myriad hosts of the Divine Kings of the Mighty Sword, the Subduer of Poisons, the Dispeller of Demons, the Devourer of Evils, the Vanquisher of Demons, the Flying Immortal Divine Kings, the Three Masters of Precepts, and the gods of thunder, lightning, wind, and rain—to traverse the world and deliver beings from all calamities.\n\nFor all beings who encounter the perils of water or fire, if they but concentrate their minds and sincerely pray, reciting this scripture, they shall be saved. If they encounter bandits or thieves, let them recite this scripture. If they suffer epidemics, let them recite this scripture. If they face great droughts, let them recite this scripture. If the state’s borders are unsettled, let them recite this scripture. If the five grains do not ripen, let them recite this scripture. If ten thousand affairs are discordant, let them recite this scripture.\n\nThose who transcribe and venerate this scripture shall naturally attract the Nine Heavens’ Generalissimo of the Three Realms, the Generals of the Three and Five, the Divine Generals of the Six Jia, the Heavenly Soldiers and Mighty Warriors, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the Perfected of Compassion, Jade Purity, and the Cavern Sovereign, the Jade Purity Divine Lads, the Merit Officers and Registrars, the Longevity Marshals, the heavenly and earthly immortals, the Divine Kings of the Mighty Sword, the Dispeller of Demons, the Subduer of Poisons, the Devourer of Evils and Ghosts, the Vanquisher of Demons, the Collector of Pestilences, the Flying Immortal Divine Kings, the Three Masters of Precepts, the Lords of Wind and Rain, and the Duke of Thunder and Mother of Lightning. With a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, they shall descend from the void, gathering at the place where the scripture is recited, bestowing boundless blessings.\n\nAll malign poisons shall be dispelled, all evil bandits shall scatter and disperse, all epidemic toxins shall naturally vanish, floods and fires shall spontaneously cease, unsettled borders shall attain peace, the four barbarians shall submit, foreign states shall come to pay tribute, epidemics and illnesses shall be cured, quarrels and disputes shall end, official oppression and fetters shall swiftly be undone, and the bonds of karmic retribution shall be severed. Demons and evils shall not arise.”\n\nThen the Perfected Limitless again addressed the Celestial Worthy, saying:\n\n“Within the world, all beings frequently suffer from scorching droughts and such tormenting heat. What methods may be employed to bring harmonious winds and rains, ensuring the abundant ripening of the five grains?”\n\nThe Celestial Worthy spoke to the Perfected Limitless, saying:\n\n“You must now receive my teachings and practice them diligently. You may establish an altar on a high mountain, by a riverbank, before a cavern or cliff, in a pure and secluded place, within a Daoist abbey, or in a household. Install the honored images, hang banners and canopies, five-colored pennants, and variegated jeweled parasols. Light lamps, burn incense, bathe, and observe the fast. Offer various flowers and fruits, widely expound the teachings, and establish the altar. Recite the scripture and perform the ritual circumambulation, making grand offerings to the Three Pure Ones, the Supreme Sages, the Great Heavenly Emperor of Jade Purity, the Limitless Celestial Worthies of the Numinous Treasure in the Ten Directions, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors, the Heavenly Father and Earthly Mother, the Three Officials and Five Emperors, the Nine Heavens and Five Bushels, the Nine Luminaries and hosts of stars, and all the immortals and numinous officials, along with the dragon spirits.\n\nBy undertaking such vast beneficence, the Celestial Worthy shall dispatch the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, the Great Demons of the Five Directions, the Lords of Wind and Rain, to stir thunder and move mists, circling the world. In an instant, winds and rains shall answer the prayers, and rivers, streams, and gullies—both high and low fields—shall be universally moistened. Grasses, trees, and forests, all flowers, fruits, and grains shall flourish, their branches and leaves luxuriant.”",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Two: Responding to the Moment**\n\nAt that time, the Most High Lord Lao sat in the Numinous Treasure Hall of the Great Clarity’s immortal realm, leaning upon his armrest and holding a jade whisk, expounding the Dao to deliver humankind. The Perfected One Yin Xi, the immortals of the ten directions, and jade maidens with golden lads bearing tablets and incense stood in attendance to his left and right.\n\nThen, the Chamberlain of the Golden Gate at the Crown led forth a numinous official, who bore a vermilion text in a blue-green case. Before the Jasper Pool, they presented their memorial, and upon its completion, offered up the case before withdrawing in reverent haste.\n\nThereupon, the Perfected One Yin Xi stepped forward, made obeisance, and addressed Lord Lao, saying: \"I, Xi, have attended upon the Most High to this day, and at every assembly of the immortals, when the hosts of heaven present their memorials, there are always true portents. Yet just now, I saw the Chamberlain of the Golden Gate lead a numinous official to the Jasper Pool, where they presented their memorial and offered up a case before withdrawing in haste. I, dull and slow of wit, humbly beseech your sagely compassion to deign to explain this.\"\n\nLord Lao replied: \"You have asked well, and I shall respond to the moment. This concerns Wang Fajin, a disciple of the Golden Elixir from Linjin County in Jianzhou, who wears the registers and practices the Dao. He performed the Numinous Treasure Celestial Lord’s ritual fast, reciting scriptures and bowing in homage day and night, his merits and memorials borne aloft by flying dragon couriers to reach the Crown Gate. Thus did the Chamberlain of the Golden Gate follow protocol to present him.\"\n\nLord Lao continued: \"The Celestial Lord’s fast originates from the nine grades of ritual fasts for petitions and thanksgiving. It is through this that faithful men and women in the world awaken to the great Dao’s generation and transformation, moved by the heavens’ covering and the earth’s bearing. The Three Primes illumine above, the Five Phases nourish below; cold and heat alternate, water and fire harmonize. The benefits of the five soils are apportioned, the seasons’ rhythms followed. Above, the celestial perfected are revered; below, the young and old are nurtured. The household prospers in joy, all things follow their will; divine spirits guard the gates, and malevolent spirits hide in retreat.\n\nOn the six fast days and ten auspicious months, an auspicious time is chosen, the dwelling purified, and the ritual space arranged to mirror heaven and earth. Images are hung, banners displayed, and the altar established. At its center are the Three Clarities and the Jade Emperor; next, the perfected of the ten directions, the Five Emperors of the Five Directions, the Three Primes and Three Officials, the Thirty-Two Heavens, the Heavenly Sovereign and Earthly Queen, the hosts of heaven and constellations, the immortals of the Three Realms, the Lords of Wind and Rain, the Duke of Thunder and Mother of Lightning, the Year-Star Spirit of Void-Space Surveillance, the Celestial Worthies, Fuxi and Shennong, the Gods of Soil and Grain, the Treasuries of Wealth, the Guardians of Life and Longevity, the great mountains and rivers, the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, the Four Duty Envoys, the local earth spirits and numinous officials, the Memorial-Supervising Officers, and the guardians of the ritual space.\n\nThe household purifies itself, and with utmost sincerity, they invite Orthodox Unity or Three Caverns masters—three, five, or seven in number—for one or three days. Seasonal fruits, tea, wine, incense, flowers, aquatic plants, and pure offerings are prepared, along with ritual cloths, silver coins, cloud-horses, life-grain, and patterned silks. Lamps are lit, incense burned, and the Dao is practiced according to the rites. When the altar rites conclude, merits are proclaimed, and the perfected are rewarded. Memorials and petitions are presented, beseeching blessings. These are entrusted to the Four Duty Envoys, who convey the petitions, while the numinous officials, memorial-supervising officers, and courier dragon riders transmit the documents aloft to the Three Clarities. The Three Clarities record the merits, promote goodness, and issue edicts to the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, the Examiners of the Five Emperors, the local immortal officials, the city gods and earth spirits, the Directors of Destiny and Registrars, and the local earth gods. All receive the celestial talismans and surround the site of the fast, and for this reason, such manifestations occur.\"\n\nThe Perfected One Yin Xi and the assembled immortals bowed in gratitude and again addressed Lord Lao, saying: \"The Numinous Treasure Celestial Lord’s fast indeed evokes wondrous responses, profound beyond measure. Yet we remain ignorant of its origins—how did this fast come to be? We, dull and unenlightened, wish to hear your sagely words.\"\n\nLord Lao replied: \"Long ago, while dwelling in the realm of the Three Clarities, I observed that all beings in the world had grown dissolute with the times, the great simplicity gradually scattering. The common people had lost the Dao, and perverse winds flourished. They disrespected the Two Modes, despised wind and rain, scorned the hundred grains, and squandered silk and cotton. They were unfilial and unkind, unbenevolent and unjust, devoted to heterodox teachings, and wantonly sacrificed to ghosts and spirits. They envied the worthy and resented the capable, were miserly, greedy, and lustful, failed to honor the great Dao, and harmed creatures, injuring life. Thus did ghosts and spirits grow harmful in their excess, heaven and earth send down calamities, floods and fires follow one another, the five grains fail to flourish, pestilence spread, and plague demons arise in competition. The myriad people suffered in misery, blaming heaven and resenting earth. Moved by compassion for beings who did not comprehend sin and fortune, I expounded the thirty-six revered scriptures, unfolded the Three Caverns’ numinous talismans, established the nine grades of ritual fasts, and set forth the nine-cycled elixir formulas, enabling all beings to awaken to the Dao through the scriptures, dispel evil by wearing the registers, summon the perfected through fasting, cultivate truth and refine conduct, return to the true, attain the Dao, and thereby attain long life.\n\nThe thirty-six revered scriptures comprise the Twelve Divisions of the Numinous Treasure Cavern of Truth, the Twelve Divisions of the Numinous Treasure Cavern of Mystery, and the Twelve Divisions of the Numinous Treasure Cavern of Spirit—thirty-six divisions in all, totaling 1,884,220 scrolls.\n\nThe Twelve Divisions of the Cavern of Truth expound the Dao of heaven and earth’s creation, the ebb and flow of yin and yang, the nine-cycled return of the elixir, the golden liquid’s refinement of form, and the flight of immortals.\n\nThe Twelve Divisions of the Cavern of Mystery expound the Dao of dispelling calamities, curing illnesses, repenting transgressions, and praying for exorcism, delivering and uplifting the living and the dead.\n\nThe Twelve Divisions of the Cavern of Spirit expound the Dao of governing the state, managing the household, and cultivating the self.\n\nThe Three Caverns’ numinous talismans are those of the Highest Clarity, the Middle Methods, and the Orthodox Unity.\n\nThe nine grades of ritual fasts comprise twenty-seven types: the Grand Perfected Fast, the Golden Register Fast, the Jade Register Fast, the Illuminating Truth Fast, the Natural Fast, the Yellow Register Fast, the Three Primes Fast, the Suffering Fast, the Cavern of Spirit Fast, the Divine Incantation Fast, the Nine Heavens Fast, the Instruction Fast, the Orthodox Unity Fast, the Celestial Treasure Fast, the Nine Dark Realms Fast, the Five Refinements Fast, the Great Peace Fast, the Great One Fast, the Eight Emperors Fast, the Three Sovereigns Fast, the Highest Clarity Fast, the Great Cavern Fast, the Golden Chamber Fast, the Northern Emperor Fast, the Five Emperors Fast, the Huahua Fast, the Numinous Treasure Fast, and the Celestial Lord Fast—each practiced in accordance with the occasion.\"",

      "translated_text": "The Golden Register, Jade Register, and Nine Heavens Fasts are the fasts of emperors and kings, not to be practiced by ministers or commoners. The Yellow Register Fast broadly delivers the three paths of suffering, extending its blessings to all beings, and aids both the living and the deceased. The Numinous Treasure Celestial Lord Fast bears the great Dao’s generative power, repays the heavens and earth for their nurturing embrace, resolves the transgressions of all living beings, invokes future blessings and felicity, prays for timely winds and rains, abundant harvests of the hundred grains, the elimination of plagues and poisons, and the bestowal of fortune and longevity. Those who undertake this fast must purify their thoughts and concentrate their spirit, offering sincere devotion—then blessings and virtue will descend as swiftly as an echo answers sound.\n\nAt that time, Lord Lao addressed Yin Xi again, saying: \"Formerly, our ancestral master, the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy, dwelled in the Three Clarities with the Jade Dawn Great Dao Lord. Observing the eighty-one kingdoms of the Western Regions, such as Khotan, which partake of the qi of western metal essence—foul in odor, fierce in nature, indulging in lust and delighting in slaughter, wantonly harming living beings, neither rulers nor ministers, neither fathers nor sons—their cruelty was boundless, their karmic transgressions ever deepening. I received the golden words of the Primordial Great Dao, commanding me to transform the Hu in the Western Regions. Arriving at the Hangu Pass, where you served as the pass officer, I saw that your nature and destiny aligned with the Dao, and your devotion to the true was unwavering. Thus, I bestowed upon you the Golden Elixir. After a thousand days of cultivation, we were to meet at the Green Sheep Market in Great Shu, where you would ascend to heaven in broad daylight. Traversing the Nine Heavens, you would pay homage to the Jade Emperor. Though you attained the Dao, you have yet to comprehend the subtle and wondrous transformations of the Primordial Great Dao. You must now listen with utmost sincerity, for I shall explain it to you.\n\nBefore heaven and earth divided, before the sun and moon shone, before the stars spread forth, before the myriad things took form—vast and boundless, chaotic and obscure—there was the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, born before heaven and earth, without ancestor or lineage, coalescing alone, nameless and formless, subtly wondrous and profoundly penetrating, endlessly transforming, fathomless in depth. He then generated the primordial qi, which nurtured the Five Agents. The Five Agents gave rise to one another, and thus heaven and earth came into being. Once heaven and earth were separated, movement and stillness took shape. Thus, heaven received the pure qi, ascending and congealing above; earth received the turbid qi, descending and solidifying below; the harmonious qi in between transformed and gave birth to the myriad spirits.\n\nThe sun arose from yang essence, the moon from yin spirit. The Eastern Dipper was established in the east, where the Five Agents correspond to wood, governing the spring’s generation. The Southern Dipper was set in the south, where the Five Agents correspond to fire, governing the summer’s growth and nourishment. The Western Dipper was arrayed in the west, where the Five Agents correspond to metal, governing the autumn’s harvest and ripening. The Northern Dipper was erected in the north, where the Five Agents correspond to water, governing the winter’s storage and preservation. The Central Dipper was arranged in the center, where the Five Agents correspond to earth, governing the four seasons, for all things depend on earth to transform and generate naturally. Once the Five Dippers were arrayed, the stars took their positions. How could the celestial patterns be mere ornament? They manifest the Dao of water, fire, metal, and the Golden Elixir—those who perceive it flourish.\"\n\nThen Lord Lao offered this hymn of praise:\n\"Before heaven and earth,\nThe Primordial Supreme Immortal.\nWithout lineage or ancestor,\nAlone he coalesced.\nNurturing the primordial qi,\nThe Five Agents came first.\nTurbid qi became earth,\nPure qi became heaven.\nHarmonious qi became humankind,\nScattered as mountains and rivers.\nStars arrayed in order,\nSun and moon hung on high.\nWood Star in the east,\nMetal Star in the west.\nNorthern Dipper in the Kan position,\nSouthern Dipper in the Li.\nSpring, summer, autumn, winter,\nSequentially they shift.\nMetal born of water,\nLinked with wood.\nFire gives rise to earth,\nMutually opposing, mutually cherishing.\nNine returns, seven reversals,\nMatched in the heavens.\nThose who perceive it flourish,\nThose who refine it become immortals.\nThe profound Dao is wondrous,\nMysterious and ever more mysterious.\"\n\nLord Lao said: \"The Primordial Heavenly Worthy generated the Three Qi from the One Qi, and the Three Qi generated the Nine Qi. The Three Qi are the Mysterious, the Primordial, and the Originative. From the qi of the Mysterious One, the Jade Clarity Sacred Realm of the Great Luo Heaven was transformed—its jasper towers and jeweled halls, the Mysterious Capital and Jade Metropolis, the Purple Tenuity Palace, where the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy resides, known as the Dragon Han Kalpa. From the qi of the Primordial One, the Upper Clarity True Realm of the Yu Yu Heaven was transformed—its jade towers and jeweled halls, forests of treasure trees, where the Jade Dawn Great Dao Lord resides, known as the Red Brightness Middle Kalpa. At that time, the Most High Dao Lord was the disciple of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy. The Primordial Heavenly Worthy, within the Beginning Azure Heaven, summoned the boundless sacred hosts of the ten directions to the Treasure Grove, where they received the transmission of the Dao and its teachings.\n\nFrom the qi of the Originative One, the Grand Clarity Immortal Realm was transformed—its pearl towers and golden palaces, halls of the seven treasures, where I reside, known as the Kaihuang Present Kalpa. I, in turn, was the disciple of the Jade Dawn Great Dao Lord. These Three Clarities and Three Sages each arose through the transformation of a kalpa, known as the Three Clarities’ Upper Realm, the Great Luo Heaven’s Mysterious Capital and Jade Metropolis.\n\nMoreover, the Three Qi each generated Three Qi, transforming into Nine Qi, which formed the Nine Heavens. Beyond the Three Clarities, the Nine Heavens were arrayed, where the Nine Heavenly Lords reside. The titles of the Nine Heavenly Immortals are:\nFirst, the Boundless Joy Heaven of Yudan;\nSecond, the Upper Superior Meditation Heaven of Endless Life;\nThird, the Brahma Supervisor Heaven of Xuyan;\nFourth, the Serene and Silent Heaven of Doushu;\nFifth, the Joyous and Unarrogant Heaven of Pāramitā;\nSixth, the Responsive Transformation Heaven of Dongyuan;\nSeventh, the Numinous Transformation Heaven of Brahma’s Assistants;\nEighth, the Lofty and Void Heaven of Clarity;\nNinth, the Heaven of No Thought, No Attachment, No Desire.\n\nBeyond the Nine Heavens lie the Thirty-Two Heavens, where the Thirty-Two Heavenly Lords reside. The titles of the Eight Eastern Heavens are:\nGreat August Yellow Radiance Heaven,\nGreat Brightness Jade Perfection Heaven,\nClarity and Brightness Haotong Heaven,\nMysterious Womb Level Nurturing Heaven,\nVoid Transcending Heng Heaven,\nGreat Ultimate Veiled Heaven,\nPrimordial Brightness Wenju Heaven,\nUpper Brightness Seven Luminaries Ma Yi Heaven.\n\nThe titles of the Eight Southern Heavens are:\nVermilion Brightness Harmonious Yang Heaven,\nMysterious Brightness Reverent Splendor Heaven,\nRadiant Brightness Ancestral Whirlwind Heaven,\nZhuoluo August Reed Heaven,\nVoid Brightness Hall of Luminaries Heaven,\nObserving Brightness Upright Serenity Heaven,\nMysterious Brightness Reverent Celebration Heaven,\nGreat Resplendence Ultimate Jade Heaven.\"",

Thereupon, the Jade Dawn Dao Lord composed the *Four Scrolls of the Numinous Writ of the Primordial Beginning*, condensing clouds into seal-script, each character a full ten feet in breadth, its eight corners trailing radiance. One scroll was placed to guard the Eight Eastern Heavens, one the Eight Southern Heavens, one the Eight Western Heavens, and one the Eight Northern Heavens, thereby preserving and restraining kalpic fate to ensure the heavens endure forever.\n\nThe Numinous Writ for the Eight Eastern Heavens reads:\nDanlou Ahui, Wuhe Guanyin.\nXuyan Mingshou, Falan Putan.\nJiana Ayu, Huhu Liuyin.\nHuadu Quli, Xianpu Yuzhen.\nTailuo Dafan, Sanyan Qingyun.\nFeisa Yudu, Mingmo Shangmen.\nWuxing Shangshou, Huizhi Liuxuan.\nAtuo Longluo, Sixiang Xuyuan.\n\nThe Numinous Writ for the Eight Southern Heavens reads:\nNanyan Dongfu, Yumou Shenxian.\nFanxing Luokong, Jiuling Weiqian.\nZeluo Puti, Lüluo Daqian.\nMiaomang Jiuchou, Shaoyao Yuanzhan.\nYunshang Jiudu, Feisheng Ziqian.\nNayu Yufu, Moluo Falun.\nHongchi Wujing, Lanzi Yunrong.\nFulang Kuoyi, Shenying Zigong.\n\nThe Numinous Writ for the Eight Western Heavens reads:\nDaoli Chanyou, Poni Joutong.\nWansou Dishe, Taimiao Zhitang.\nLiuluo Fanmeng, Jingwei Xiaoyu.\nYimiao Wuji, Wanshou Shaodu.\nAlan Yuzhu, Huamo Yanyou.\nJiukai Zibian, Anapin Shou.\nWuliang Fugai, Fuluo Heshen.\nYudan Changsang, Bokong Duxian.\n\nThe Numinous Writ for the Eight Northern Heavens reads:\nJuewu Ziyu, Jiuri Daoqian.\nKunmu Dongfu, Xingshe Shangxuan.\nTuoluo Yumiao, Miaogi Heyun.\nFeitian Dashou, Zongjian Shangtian.\nShatuo Jieliang, Longhan Yingxian.\nBiluo Fuli, Kongge Baozhen.\nEyi Wupin, Dongmiao Zizhen.\nYuanfan Huimo, Youji Duren.\n\nThus the sun and moon course through their orbits, the stars array their radiance, the Five Phases alternate in function, the Four Seasons flow in harmony. Day and night, cold and heat, the Thunder Duke and Lightning Mother, the Wind Earl and Rain Master—all ascend to follow the celestial constants, each attending to its appointed office.\n\nThe Eulogy states:\nThe Primordial Qi of the Mysterious Origin\nArises from the Dao and takes form.\nThe Three Qi transform and evolve,\nGiving birth to the Jade Capital.\nJewel palaces and jade halls,\nPrecious trees towering and grand.\nThe Lord of the Great Luo Heaven,\nDwells in the Three Clarities’ realm.\nThe Three Clarities’ ministers,\nComplete their work in three kalpas.\nThe Three Qi still extend,\nGiving rise to the Nine Heavens.\nThe Nine Heavens respond to change,\nAnd the Thirty-Two Heavens.\nPalaces of seven treasures,\nGuarded by jade scrolls.\nPreserving and restraining kalpic fate,\nEnsuring the heavens endure forever.\nThe sun and moon revolve,\nThe constellations stretch in sequence.\nThe Five Phases without flaw,\nThe Four Seasons proclaim their course.\nDay and night,\nImpartial and unbiased.\nThe Thunder Duke and Lightning Mother,\nThe Wind Earl and Rain Master,\nReverently obey Heaven’s mandate,\nEach attending to its office.\nWhen the Jade Candle is harmonized,\nAll things flourish.\nThe Dao of Heaven and Earth,\nIts merit profound and selfless.\n\nHere ends the *Central Scroll of the Most High Cavern Spirit Heavenly Lord’s Scripture on Dispelling Demons and Protecting the State*.\n\n---\n\nThe *Lower Scroll of the Most High Cavern Spirit Heavenly Lord’s Scripture on Dispelling Demons and Protecting the State*\n**Chapter Three: The Governance of All Under Heaven**\n\nThe Lord Lao said: The Heavenly Lord embodies the Heavenly Dao—impartial and selfless. The Heavenly Father and Earthly Mother are the Great Jade Emperor of Heaven. Once Heaven and Earth and the myriad things were complete, the Primordial Beginning Great Dao withdrew into non-action, and thus commanded the Jade Emperor to govern the Three Realms, to shelter and nurture all living beings with impartiality and selflessness.\n\nHe appointed the Earthly Mother as the Earthly Empress, charged the Heavenly Officials with the Celestial Bureau, the Earthly Officials with the Earthly Courts, and the Water Officials with the Watery Realms. He arrayed the Four Seas and Five Peaks, the famous mountains and great rivers, the cavern grottoes and blessed lands, each assigned to immortal officials for governance.\n\nHe further dispatched the Directors of Destiny and Registrars, the Day Patrols and Moon Circuits, the Year, Month, Day, and Hour Attendants, the Four Duty Envoys, the Void Observers, and the local Earth Gods and Mountain Spirits—all divided into offices and ranks, patrolling the world to investigate right and wrong. Thus the Son of Heaven in the human realm, emulating Heaven and Earth, established a capital in the Central Plains and distributed the Nine Provinces and Hundred Prefectures, the Four Barbarians and Eight Wild Tribes.\n\nHe appointed officials for the Four Seasons—spring, summer, autumn, and winter—along with the Three Dukes, Nine Ministers, civil and military officials, each assigned to their offices to govern all under Heaven.\n\nThe Son of Heaven is no ordinary mortal; he is endowed with the true primordial essence of the One Qi. Through successive generations, he descends to be born, as an Upper Immortal in the celestial realms or an Upper Constellation in the heavens. All receive the mandate of the Great Dao and Jade Emperor, descending in accordance with the cosmic cycles and ascending in turn—such is the celestial reckoning.\n\nTherefore, the Northern Asterism stands above while the host of stars pay homage. In the heavens, there are the Emperor’s Seat Star, the Empress and Consort Stars, the Crown Prince Star, the Princes’ Stars, the Three Terraces Stars, the Four Inner Assistants Stars, the Feudal Lords’ Stars, the Lord’s Foundation Star, the Minister’s Foundation Star, the People’s Foundation Star, the Literary Star, and the Martial Star. Below, the myriad things correspond to the myriad stars above.\n\nHeaven and Earth are truly the children of the Great Dao, and the myriad things are the grandchildren of the Great Dao. The Great Dao is the origin of Heaven and Earth, and the Two Modes are the root of the myriad things. Yin and yang ascend and descend, Heaven and Earth’s qi intermingle, and then the hundred grains are sown to universally succor all living beings. The Great Dao’s work in the cosmos is profound beyond measure, silently nurturing the myriad things without claiming virtue or benevolence. The myriad things naturally return to it, yet its merit does not presume to govern. Thus, through fasting and uprightness, one repays the grace of the Great Dao, Heaven, and Earth.",

It may be recited on the days of one’s original destiny, the Four Seasons, the Eight Festivals, the Six Fasts, the Ten Straight Days, or when averting drought or flood, praying for the five grains, seeking blessings and protection, repenting transgressions to dispel misfortune, or breaking curses. According to one’s wishes, with sincere devotion, invite one, two, three, five, or seven Orthodox Unity or Three Caverns masters to build merit by reciting this scripture, performing purification rites, and practicing the Dao. Blessings and virtue will descend at once, dispelling all misfortune.\n\nOr, during the three spring months when Heaven and Earth bring forth life, or in autumn and winter when the myriad things mature, burn incense and make offerings, reciting this scripture to bear the merit of the Great Dao’s life-giving work in Heaven and Earth. Heaven hears the humble, the Dao responds to sincerity. Record these earnest prayers, and all will be granted blessings and good fortune. Its profound principles are subtle, its majesty and grace unfathomable. Revere it! Revere it!\n\nWhen performing the Heavenly Lord’s purification rites, one must fast and purify, abstain from meat and pungent foods, sweep and cleanse the dwelling. All matters must be pure and pristine. The Great Dao of Heaven and Earth observes and records sincerity. Strictly avoid using common objects, as well as items touched by mourners, pregnant women, chickens, dogs, monks, or nuns—anything impure—lest it offend the true and great Dao of Heaven. Heaven and Earth reward and punish without partiality; their responses to reverence or disrespect are irresistible.\n\nFor all purification rites and offerings, every item must be abundant. Even slight negligence will cause the Celestial Emperor to refuse them, turning blessings into misfortune. Let all men and women revere this with utmost care.\n\nThis is the Heavenly Lord’s incantation to subdue evil spirits. If faithful devotees of the Dao—good men and women—wish to practice divination, they must first burn incense, bow in reverence, and silently invoke the Three Clarities, the Perfected of Highest Heaven, the Celestial Emperors, the Heavenly Father and Earthly Mother, the Incense Officers of the Day, and the local earth deities.
