  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Perpetual Secret of the Five Planets and Seven Primes**\n\n**Text Title:** *The Supreme Perpetual Secret of the Five Planets and Seven Primes*\nAuthor unknown, approximately dated to the Northern and Southern Dynasties. It describes the technique of \"stepping the *gang* and the Dipper.\" One scroll.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* Section, Methods Category.\n\n**The Supreme Perpetual Secret of the Five Planets and Seven Primes**\n\n**Diagram of the Seven Primes**\nThe Dao of traversing the Five Planets involves pacing to summon the descent of the Five Planets—Water, Wood, Fire, Earth, and Metal—thereby invoking divine clouds and feathered canopies to ascend the steps of the Great Mystery. The method of Master Guxi requires holding the breath to mount the *gang*, traversing back and forth fifteen times. Upon reaching each planet’s position, press the left hand to the heart and silently recite: *\"The Five Planets array their radiance...\"* Before ascending the *gang*, first visualize the essence of the Five Planets within the Five Viscera. After each pacing of the *gang*, perform the prescribed gestures. Practicing this for fourteen years, one may ascend in broad daylight upon a dragon’s flight. The essential Dao lies upon this silk scroll—such is its diagram.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Dao paces the path of the Five Planets to induce their descent into the chamber. Holding the breath to mount the *gang*, one must first invoke the names of the Five Planetary Sovereign Ladies. Only after this may one cross the *gang* and tread upon the stars. This means that upon first mounting the *gang*, one pauses to call their names; once the invocation is complete, one then crosses the *gang* and treads upon the stars. If, upon reaching each planet, one repeats the invocation of the name and style of the planet’s sovereign, it is all the more excellent. If the practice becomes too arduous, one may simply follow the old method. In ancient times, Master Yusha, Beilizi, and the Elder of Changling all ascended to heaven by this method, never shirking its difficulties.\n\nThis is what is meant by \"cultivating life.\" Merchants toil ceaselessly—how could they fear hardship? Their sole aim is profit. If seekers of the Dao were as single-minded as merchants, how could they fail to attain immortality? Yet most beginners claim devotion and diligence, only to grow lax afterward, like a cart on the verge of collapse whose every joint loosens, or an ox burdened with a heavy load struggling on a long journey. Such are the afflictions of the unaccomplished, and the amusement of the attained. All such matters are of this kind. If one’s heart is refined as an inner mirror, it will resonate with the divine, and spiritual beings may awaken one’s ignorance, bearing the chariot of the stars and light.\n\n**Arrangement of the Five Planets Diagram**\nIt should always face south, with Venus positioned in the west and Jupiter in the east, following the prescribed order. The reason is that the Five Planets conceal and reveal themselves unpredictably, unlike the Northern Dipper, whose fixed form eternally determines its position in the five directions. Thus, one cannot follow the planets’ shifting locations.\n\nThe Perfected of Primordial Simplicity said: When stepping the Five Planets, before first mounting the stellar *gang* and after descending from it, one must first visualize the essence of the Five Planets within the Five Viscera. Upon completing the visualization, knock the teeth five times, swallow saliva five times, and softly recite the incantation:\n*\"The Five Celestial Bodies array in splendor, illuminating the five directions.\nThe Water Star averts calamity; the Wood Star brings prosperity.\nThe Radiant Deluder dispels misfortune; Venus repels warfare.\nSaturn guards the four quarters; I attain favorable augury.\nMy name is inscribed on jade tablets, recorded in the Emperor’s chamber.\nRiding the whirlwind and fanning the light, I soar through the Great Void,\nEmerging and entering the unseen, roaming and feasting in the ten directions.\nFive-colored clouds cover me; I summon spirits and command the winds,\nEnlisting the myriad numina, ascending as an Immortal Duke.\"*\nThis is recited while facing the *gang* with a focused mind, during the moments of ascent and descent.\n\n**The Five Planetary Sovereigns and Their Consorts**\n- **Eastern Jupiter, True Sovereign Lord:** Name: Chenglan, style: Qingning. His Lady: Baorong, style: Feiyun.\n- **Southern Mars, True Sovereign Lord:** Name: Weiting, style: Sanrong. His Lady: Huaping, style: Xuanluo.\n- **Central Saturn, True Sovereign Lord:** Name: Zanglu, style: Danyan. His Lady: Kongyao, style: Feixian.\n- **Western Venus, True Sovereign Lord:** Name: Liaoling, style: Zhenxun. His Lady: Souying, style: Lingen.\n- **Northern Mercury, True Sovereign Lord:** Name: Xianxuan, style: Jingyuan. His Lady: Xuanhua, style: Long’e.\n\nHolding the breath to mount the *gang*, first invoke the names of the Five Planets and their Ladies. Only then cross the *gang* and tread upon the stars. Begin by lifting both feet onto Venus, then ascend from Venus to Saturn, from Saturn to Mars, from Mars to Jupiter, from Jupiter to Mercury, and from Mercury return to tread upon Venus. After three complete cycles, hold the breath again to mount the *gang*, following the old method of traversing back and forth fifteen times. Upon reaching each planet’s position, invoke the names of the Sovereign Lord and his Lady, press the left hand to the heart, and recite the incantation.\n\nThe text states: When performing the ritual, one should face north while holding the concealed script, for beginners of the true and wondrous Dao, unfamiliar with the subtleties of stellar positions and the Dipper’s directional shifts, must face north while holding the text to gradually grasp its meaning. Once the script’s intent is understood and the stars’ movements with the seasons are recognized, one should naturally follow the Dipper’s orientation, pacing and visualizing accordingly. Thus, there is no fixed direction, and one need not always face north. Facing north is solely for beginners. This principle may be extended by analogy—no further questions are needed.\n\nThe Three Eights and the Twenty-Four Spirits may be recited in sequence, or all three Eights may be visualized at once. Alternatively, one may visualize the Upper Radiance at dawn, the Middle Radiance at noon, and the Lower Radiance at midnight—this depends on the practitioner’s intention. If one retreats to a secluded cliff, free from worldly affairs, and inwardly focuses on the Spirit Gate while absorbing the morning qi of the true, one may visualize the Three Eights at dawn, then reinforce each of the three periods with an additional visualization—this is even more excellent. However, worldly affairs often hinder consistent practice, and irregularity diminishes its benefits. In ancient times, the Perfected Lord of Xicheng and the Supreme Immortal of Tongwu both followed this Dao.\n\nFrom the *Baoxuan Yulu Baijian Qingjing* it is said: Those who do not visualize the Twenty-Four Spirits or know the names of the Three Eights Radiance cannot be counted among the people of Great Peace, nor can they become ministers to the Later Sage.\n\nThe Primordial Perfected One of Great Simplicity said: If one wishes to transform and divide the body, conceal oneself in the eight directions, hide the form and conceal the radiance, enter emptiness and create darkness, summon the myriad things, and pursue and capture all evils, one must constantly cultivate the refined contemplation of the *Kongchang* (Space-Constant). This practice should also be performed on the Eight Seasonal Nodes and the Six Ding Days. If these coincide with double days, the practice may be repeated. Alternatively, one may perform it after pacing the *gang* (cosmic steps)—this is also excellent. Such is the Dao of concealment and disappearance.\n\nAbove the *Kongchang* *gang*, there are twenty-five black dots:\n\n1. The first dot is named *Jiuchang* (Nine-Constant), where one may reside to escape form.\n2. The second dot is named *Yuchang* (Nurturing-Constant), where one may transform the body into the myriad grasses and trees.\n3. The third dot is named *Maochang* (Mao-Constant), where one may transform the body into the myriad mountains and hills.\n4. The fourth dot is named *Liuchang* (Flowing-Constant), where one may escape *qi* and transform *qi*.\n5. The fifth dot is named *Xingchang* (Moving-Constant), where one may escape fire.\n6. The sixth dot is named *Shangchang* (Upper-Constant), where one appears to others as if between heaven and earth.\n7. The seventh dot is named *Tianchang* (Heaven-Constant), where one may escape fire.\n8. The eighth dot is named *Xuanchang* (Mystery-Constant), where one may escape water.\n9. The ninth dot is named *Sanchang* (Three-Constant), where one may escape weapons.\n10. The tenth dot is named *Chenchang* (Chen-Constant), where one may escape death.\n11. The eleventh dot is the central *Zhuchu* (Prayer-Point) of *Kongchang*, representing the heart.\n12. The twelfth dot is named *Hechang* (River-Constant), where one may transform into water and fire.\n13. The thirteenth dot is named *Yuanchang* (Origin-Constant), where one may dwell and transform into grasses and trees.\n14. The fourteenth dot is named *Guchang* (Ancient-Constant), where one may dwell and transform into birds at will.\n15. The fifteenth dot is named *Sichang* (Si-Constant), where one may transform the body into birds and beasts.\n16. The sixteenth dot is named *Jiuchang* (Nine-Constant), where one may escape misfortune.\n17. The seventeenth dot is named *Shichang* (World-Constant), where one may escape spirits.\n18. The eighteenth dot is named *Mingchang* (Bright-Constant), where one may escape water and become earth.\n19. The nineteenth dot is named *Yuchang* (Jade-Constant), where one may dwell and become a tiger.\n20. The twentieth dot is named *Fachang* (Dharma-Constant), where one may transform the body into a thousand forms.\n21. The twenty-first dot is named *Yinchang* (Yin-Constant), where one may dwell and transform into a dragon.\n22. The twenty-second dot is named *Huangchang* (Yellow-Constant), where one may transform into a woman and divide the body into a hundred forms.\n23. The twenty-third dot is named *Dingchang* (Stable-Constant), where one may dwell and transform into the myriad things at will.\n24. The twenty-fourth dot is named *Feichang* (Flying-Constant), where one may escape the body as the six domestic animals, unseen by others.\n25. The twenty-fifth dot is named *Liuchang* (Six-Constant), where one may escape ghosts that kill people.\n\nThe method of pacing the *Kongchang* *gang* begins at *Jiuchang*. Each time one reaches the eleventh central star, one should softly recite the prayer:\n*\"The Four Brightnesses of the Upper Origin, the radiance of sun and moon, flowing light resplendent, the twenty-five stars, pour liquid to congeal the hun-soul, spirit-water disperses form, washes away filth and purifies, penetrating the dark and obscure. Jade tablets and blue registers, tall and inscribed with names, stone mirrors and jade horses, revealing the forms of ghosts. Conceal the body in the numinous weft, ascend to pay homage to the Upper Clarity.\"*\n\nWithin the first star of the Dipper lies the Inner Consort of the *Taiqing* (Great Clarity) Center, the Transformer, Concealer, and Escapist, named *Kongchang Fayuan*, with the style *Xin Zhengpi*. She wears a yellow brocade cloak and a cinnabar-green flying skirt.\n\nThe second star is the Inner Concubine of Embryo Transformation and Form Protection, named *Kongchang Sanci*, with the style *Luo Zhuying*. She wears a blue brocade cloak and a green-feathered flying skirt.\n\nThe third true star is the Upper Origin Primordial Mother of the Six Escapes and Seven Concealments, named *Kongchang Lingyi*, with the style *Chong Shuangzhao*. She wears a blue brocade cloak and an embroidered feathered skirt.\n\nThe fourth star of the *Niu* (Handle) is the Inner Consort of Concealed Radiance and Hidden Light, named *Kongchang Qilie*, with the style *Heng Danpan*. She is draped in a purple brocade robe and wears a yellow-feathered skirt.\n\nThe fifth star of the *Gang* (Net) is the Great Maiden of the Dipper’s Center, the Transformer of Body and Changer of Radiance, named *Kongchang Yushu*, with the style *Chou Qiulan*. She wears a vermilion brocade cloak and a purple-green flying skirt.\n\nThe sixth star of the *Ji* (Record) is the Middle Maiden of the Dipper’s Center, the Concealer of Traces and Disperser of Images, named *Kongchang Qijing*, with the style *Bao Dingling*. She wears a vermilion brocade cloak and a blue-embroidered flying skirt.\n\nThe seventh star of the *Guan* (Pass) is the Young Maiden of the Dipper’s Center, the Divider of Radiance into Myriad Forms, named *Kongchang Yumo*, with the style *Tian Fanshu*. She wears a cinnabar brocade cloak and a blue-feathered skirt.\n\nThe eighth star of the *Di* (Emperor) is the Left Consort of the High Sovereign of the Dipper’s Center, the Transformer of Sun, Moon, Water, and Fire, named *Kongchang Shi Qizhu*, with the style *Luo Maohua*. She wears a purple brocade cloak and an embroidered feathered skirt.\n\nThe ninth star of the *Zun* (Honored) is the Right Consort of the High Sovereign of the Dipper’s Center, the Transformer of Metal, Stone, Mountains, and Rivers, named *Kongchang Ai Shangtiao*, with the style *Ling Yu Xuan*. She wears a green brocade cloak and a kingfisher-feathered skirt.\n\nAll nine wear their hair in cloud-like topknots.\n\nTo ascend the *gang* while holding the breath, one must first call the names of the nine stellar Inner Consorts, then step upon the stars.\n\nThe *Tai Bai* (Venus) star lies horizontally, its rays scattering like the edges of a blade. One then exhales the *Three Separates* and *Two Golden Flowers*, causing the *Tu Fei* (Chart Boiling) to fill the *Zeng Yu* (Augmented Realm) and the *Liu Chang* (Flowing Field). The *Xuan Shi* (Mysterious Chamber) is the bright and dense *Tai Bai* star. It moves horizontally, its rays scattering like the edges of a blade, spreading across the nine heavens.\n\nThe Perfected One, visualizing this star with its seven rays, constantly exhales the three western rays and draws in the two southern rays. Thus, the golden radiance pierces the eyes, the chart becomes luminous and seething, penetrating the entire body. Once penetrated, one may enter the stellar deities’ *Zeng Yu* and *Liu Yang* palaces. Within these palaces lies the *Xuan Shi*, where one may wander in tranquility and be revered as a Perfected One. These are the names of the chambers within the *Tai Bai* star.\n\nRegarding the practice of the *Tai Shang Yin Shu* (Supreme Perfected’s Concealment Writ), the scripture states: When performing the practice, one should face north while holding the *Yin Shu* (Concealment Writ). This is because beginners in the true and wondrous have not yet ventured into the subtle and distant, do not understand the orientation of stellar positions, nor recognize the Dipper’s directional alignment. Thus, they should face north while holding the writ, gradually seeking understanding. Once the meaning of the writ is grasped and the turning of the stars is recognized with the seasons, one may naturally follow the Dipper’s alignment and pace accordingly. In this way, there is no fixed direction, and one need not always face north. Facing north is merely for beginners.\n\nPerhaps this can be understood by analogy, and no further questions are needed.\n\nThe Perfected One of the Supreme practices the pacing of the Five Stars’ Dao to summon the descent of the Five Stars into their chambers. While holding the breath to ascend the *gang*, one must first call the names of the Five Stellar Lords and Royal Consorts, then step over the *gang* and tread upon the stars.\n\nTo ascend the *gang*, one should pause immediately upon reaching it and call the names, then step over the *gang* and tread upon the stars. If, upon arriving at each star, one again focuses the mind and calls the name of that star’s position, it is even better. Should this prove too cumbersome for regular practice, one may proceed as before.\n\nIn ancient times, Master Yushai, Beili Zisheng, and the Elder of Changling all followed this method to ascend to heaven, undeterred by its complexity. This is akin to the way of managing life. Do merchants, in their eagerness for profit, shrink from peril or hardship? Their sole aim is wealth. If seekers of the Dao were as single-minded as merchants, what could prevent them from attaining immortality?\n\nYet beginners often claim devotion and diligence, only to grow lax and negligent thereafter—like a cart on the verge of collapse, its joints scattering, or an ox burdened with weight, its hooves faltering on a long journey. Such are the failings of late learners, the very ones whom the accomplished mock.\n\nIf one can inwardly refine the mind as a mirror, this will stir the numinous. Then, divine beings may awaken one’s obscurity and bear one aloft in the chariot of celestial radiance.\n\nWhen arranging the diagram of the Five Stars, one should face south, with Venus positioned in the west and Jupiter in the east, proceeding accordingly. The reason for this is that the Five Stars conceal and reveal themselves unpredictably, shifting without constancy. Unlike the Northern Dipper, which maintains its fixed form and determines the positions of the five directions, one cannot follow the stars’ transient locations.\n\nThe Three Eights, combined with the Twenty-Four Spirits, may be recited in sequence. Alternatively, one may invoke all Three Eights at once, or store the Upper Radiance at dawn, the Middle Radiance at noon, and the Lower Radiance at midnight—this is left to the practitioner’s intention.\n\nIf one retreats to a secluded cliff, cutting off worldly affairs, and inwardly focuses on the Spirit Gate while gathering the morning’s true qi, then at dawn one may invoke all Three Eights at once, and in each of the three periods, further store one radiance—this would be even better. However, worldly matters often make such consistent practice difficult. Infrequent practice yields only meager benefits.\n\nIn ancient times, the Perfected Lord of Xicheng and the Supreme One of Tongwu both followed this Dao.\n\nAs the *Baoxuan Yulu Baijian Qingjing* states: \"Those who do not store the Twenty-Four Spirits or know the names of the Three Eights cannot be counted among the people of Great Peace, nor can they serve as ministers to the Later Sage. When receiving the *Dadong Zhenjing*, one should also receive the methods of the Supreme Dao. One’s robes and headscarves must not be lent to others, nor should one share vessels, carriages, clothing, beds, or sleeping quarters. This is to block the paths of filth and impurity and guard against the intrusion of perverse winds.\"\n\nThis is easily practiced, yet deemed difficult—such is the way of those whose faith in the Dao is not sincere, who aspire to fly yet sink instead.\n\nFor those cultivating the Grotto Chamber and pacing the Seven Origins, upon first rising from sleep, when first venturing out, and after meals, one should softly recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Five August Ones, Five Penetrations,\nJade Script of the Grotto Chamber,\nReturn to the Hidden Dao,\nExpand the Seven Dawns.\nThe Mysterious Father gives birth to the hun-soul,\nTransforming the One into spirit.\nThe Mysterious Mother gives birth to the po-soul,\nTransforming the Two into body.\nThe Duke’s Son gathers my sinews and bones,\nWhite Prime governs my essence and qi.\nLong life and enduring vision,\nAscend as an immortal to the Ten Heavens.\"*\n\nThis must be recited without letting the ears hear the sound. This is the Supreme One’s hidden incantation, used to dispel perverse qi and summon spirit, enabling transformation, division of form, concealment in the eight directions, vanishing of the body, hiding of radiance, entering emptiness, and traversing darkness. It allows one to summon the myriad things, hunt down all treacheries, and cultivate the refined contemplation of the Void and Constancy.\n\nOne should pace the Void and Constancy *gang* once every seven days, as one would pace the Seven Origins. This may be done at midnight, noon, or dawn, within a quiet chamber. It should also be practiced on the eight solar terms and the six Ding days. If these coincide with doubled days, one may perform it twice, or pace it again after completing the steps—this is also good. This is the essential Dao of concealment and vanishing.\n\nUpon the Void and Constancy *gang* are twenty-five black dots:\n\n1. The first dot is the earthly name *Nine Constancies*, where one may escape form. Its taboo name is *Yingyu*, and its style is *Tongjiao*.\n2. The second dot is named *Yuchang*, where one may transform the body into the myriad grasses and trees. Its name is *Huantong*, and its style is *Youyuan*.\n3. The third dot is named *Maochang*, where one may transform the body into the myriad mountains and hills. Its name is *Jinshang*, and its style is *Haoting*.\n4. The fourth dot is named *Liuchang*, where one may escape qi and transform qi. Its name is *Guqing*, and its style is *Taoji*.\n5. The fifth dot is named *Xingchang*, where one may escape fire. Its name is *Haozhao*, and its style is *Xuansheng*.\n6. The sixth dot is named *Shangchang*, where people see one as ascending to heaven and descending to earth. Its name is *Huangguang*, and its style is *Yuanlang*.\n7. The seventh dot is named *Tianchang*, where one may escape fire. Its name is *Liaotiao*, and its style is *Zhuodu*.\n8. The eighth dot is named *Xuanchang*, where one may escape water. Its name is *Kongtiao*, and its style is *Xiaxuan*.\n9. The ninth dot is named *Sanchang*, where one may escape weapons. Its name is *Tengmin*, and its style is *Yunbian*.\n10. The tenth dot is named *Chenchang*, where one may escape death. Its name is *Neiyi*, and its style is *Yiwei*.\n11. The eleventh dot is the central incantation point of the Void and Constancy, the heart. Its name is *Dangyang*, and its style is *Yuanyuan*.\n12. The twelfth dot is named *Hechang*, where one may transform into water and fire. Its name is *Liujing*, and its style is *Qizhuan*.\n13. The thirteenth dot is named *Yuanchang*, where one may dwell and transform into grasses and trees. Its name is *Nanzhi*, and its style is *Jingji*.\n14. The fourteenth dot is named *Guchang*, where one may dwell and transform into birds at will. Its name is *Dongsheng*, and its style is *Weitong*.\n15. The fifteenth dot is named *Jichang*, where one may transform the form into birds and beasts. Its name is *Lixing*, and its style is *Houhua*.\n16. The sixteenth dot is named *Jiuchang*, where one may escape misfortune. Its name is *Qingbao*, and its style is *Shangyang*.\n17. The seventeenth dot is named *Shichang*, where one may escape spirits. Its name is *Cangyuan*, and its style is *Changming*.\n18. The eighteenth dot is named *Mingchang*, where one may escape water and become earth. Its name is *Biyuan*, and its style is *Dongsheng*.\n19. The nineteenth dot is named *Yuchang*, where one may dwell and become a tiger. Its name is *Guiqing*, and its style is *Yuyang*.\n20. The twentieth dot is named *Fachang*, where one may transform into a thousand bodies.\n\n21. The twenty-first dot is named *Lǜhuà*, where one may transform into a dragon. Its name is *Míng’ài*, and its style is *Xuántōng*, with the courtesy name *Zǐyuán*.\n22. The twenty-second dot is named *Huángcháng*, where one may transform into a woman and divide the form into a hundred. Its name is *Rìkōng*, and its style is *Dōngyí*.\n23. The twenty-third dot is named *Dìngcháng*, where one may dwell and transform into all things at will. Its name is *Yǐnyáng*, and its style is *Fūguāng*.\n24. The twenty-fourth dot is named *Fēicháng*, where one may escape the body as the six livestock while remaining unseen by others. Its name is *Shàngyuán*, and its style is *Cángguāng*.\n25. The twenty-fifth dot is named *Liùcháng*, where one may escape from ghosts and those who would kill. Its name is *Zhōngbiàn*, and its style is *Fēntú*.\n\nWhen pacing the Five Stars, before ascending the stellar *gāng* and after descending from it, first visualize the essence of the Five Stars within one’s five viscera. Upon completion, click the teeth five times, swallow saliva five times, and softly recite the invocation:\n*\"The Five Celestial Bodies array in splendor, illuminating the five directions.\nThe Water Star averts calamity; the Wood Star brings prosperity.\nThe Radiant Star dispels misfortune; the Great White repels weapons.\nThe Quelling Star guards the four quarters; I attain favorable divination.\nMy name is inscribed on the Jade Tablet, recorded in the Celestial Chamber.\nRiding the whirlwind and fanning the light, I soar through the Great Void,\nEmerging and entering the unseen, roaming and feasting in the ten directions.\nFive clouds cover me; I summon spirits and command the winds,\nEnlisting the myriad numina, ascending as an immortal lord.\"*\n\nConclude by focusing the mind toward the *gāng* and reciting the invocation at the moment of ascent and descent. When holding the breath to ascend the *gāng*, first call the names of the Five Stars and their consorts, then step over the *gāng* and tread upon the stars. Begin by raising both feet onto the Great White Star, then proceed from the White to the Quelling Star, from the Quelling to the Fire Star, from the Fire to the Wood Star, from the Wood to the Water Star, and from the Water back to the Great White. Repeat this thrice, then hold the breath again to ascend the *gāng*, following the established path fifteen times. At each star, call the names of the August Lords and their consorts, press the left hand to the heart, and recite the invocation.\n\n**First, the Great White Star:**\nYellow brocade mantle, vermilion and azure flying skirts.\n\n**Second, the Origin Star:**\nAzure brocade mantle, green feathered flying skirts.\n\n**Third, the True Star:**\nAzure brocade mantle, embroidered feathered ceremonial skirts.\n\n**Fourth, the Tie Star:**\nPurple brocade mantle, yellow flowered feathered skirts.\n\n**Fifth, the Net Star:**\nCrimson brocade mantle, purple and azure flying skirts.\n\n**Sixth, the Record Star:**\nCrimson brocade mantle, azure embroidered flying skirts.\n\n**Seventh, the Barrier Star:**\nVermilion brocade mantle, azure flowered feathered skirts.\n\n**Eighth, the Imperial Star:**\nPurple brocade mantle, embroidered feathered flying skirts.\n\n**Ninth, the Venerable Star:**\nGreen brocade mantle, kingfisher feathered ceremonial skirts.\nAll wear cloud-coiled topknots.\n\nFor the method of pacing the *Kōngcháng* Dao, begin at the ninth dot, *Jiǔcháng*. Each time you reach the eleventh dot, the Central Star, softly recite the invocation:\n*\"The Four Luminaries of the Upper Origin, the radiance of sun and moon,\nStreaming light resplendent, the Twenty-Five Stars,\nInfuse the elixir and congeal the soul, divine water disperses form.\nWashing away defilement and refining purity, penetrating the dark and unseen,\nNames inscribed on Jade Tablets and Azure Records, carved in the High Pavilion.\nStone mirrors and jade steeds reveal the forms of ghosts;\nConcealing the body with sacred talismans, I ascend to pay homage in the Upper Clarity.\"*\n\n**Eastern Year Star August Lord:** Chénglán Qīngníng\n**Consort:** Bǎoróng Fēiyún\n\n**Southern Radiant Star August Lord:** Wéitíng Sànróng\n**Consort:** Huápíng Xuánluó\n\n**Central Quelling Star August Lord:** Cánglù Dānyán\n**Consort:** Kōngyáo Fēixián\n\n**Western Great White Star August Lord:** Liáolíng Zhènxún\n**Consort:** Biāoyīng Líng’ēn\n\n**Northern Water Star August Lord:** Xiánxuān Jīngyuán\n**Consort:** Xuánhuá Lóng’é\n\n**The Flying Pacing of the *Kōngcháng* Chart**\n**Essential Instructions for Cultivating the *Kōngcháng* Method**\n\nWhenever one wishes to pace the *Kōngcháng*, fly the *gāng*, escape form, transform appearance, and ascend to the Jade Clarity, perform the practice seven times in a month. On the eight solar nodes and the six *Dīng* days, follow this method. On the appointed day, enter the chamber, burn incense on both sides, spread out the chart and mat, face south, click the teeth twenty-four times, close the eyes, and visualize the Five Stars shining brilliantly in the five directions. After a long while, see them descend and enter the five viscera: the Metal Star into the Lung Palace, the Earth Star into the Spleen Palace, the Fire Star into the Heart Palace, the Wood Star into the Liver Palace, and the Water Star into the Kidney Palace. The Five Stars radiate light, illuminating the five viscera, and the body feels warm. Then visualize the August Consorts of the Five Stars and the names and attire of the Twenty-Five *Kōngcháng* August Lords and Morning Lords, each in their respective directions. When all is complete, softly recite the invocation:\n*\"Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth, the primal qi of the Four Origins,\nMysterious essence flowing and shining, illuminating the Five Luminaries.\nWithin are the Five Stars, the numinous lords and consorts,\nThe Twenty-Five Dots, the *Kōngcháng* Celestial Worthies,\nTransforming and dividing forms a thousandfold and myriadfold,\nDescending into the five viscera, coalescing into Jade Immortals.\nRefining my seven *pò*, nurturing my three *hún*,\nI raise my form to ascend, flying into the Dipper’s Gate,\nRoaming and playing in the Upper Capital, the Five Stars gathering in throngs.\nToday, in this mysterious celebration, I request that all be as recited.\"*\n\nDraw in the starlight and qi, swallowing twenty-five times, then rise to pace the *gāng*.

      "translated_text": "**The Supreme Perpetual Secret of the Five Planets and Seven Primes**\n\n**Text Title:** *The Supreme Perpetual Secret of the Five Planets and Seven Primes*\nAuthor unknown, approximately dated to the Northern and Southern Dynasties. It describes the technique of \"stepping the *gang* and the Dipper.\" One scroll.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* Section, Methods Category.\n\n**The Supreme Perpetual Secret of the Five Planets and Seven Primes**\n\n**Diagram of the Seven Primes**\nThe Dao of traversing the Five Planets involves pacing to summon the descent of the Five Planets—Water, Wood, Fire, Earth, and Metal—thereby invoking divine clouds and feathered canopies to ascend the steps of the Great Mystery. The method of Master Guxi requires holding the breath to mount the *gang*, traversing back and forth fifteen times. Upon reaching each planet’s position, press the left hand to the heart and silently recite: *\"The Five Planets array their radiance...\"* Before ascending the *gang*, first visualize the essence of the Five Planets within the Five Viscera. After each pacing of the *gang*, perform the prescribed gestures. Practicing this for fourteen years, one may ascend in broad daylight upon a dragon’s flight. The essential Dao lies upon this silk scroll—such is its diagram.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Dao paces the path of the Five Planets to induce their descent into the chamber. Holding the breath to mount the *gang*, one must first invoke the names of the Five Planetary Sovereign Ladies. Only after this may one cross the *gang* and tread upon the stars. This means that upon first mounting the *gang*, one pauses to call their names; once the invocation is complete, one then crosses the *gang* and treads upon the stars. If, upon reaching each planet, one repeats the invocation of the name and style of the planet’s sovereign, it is all the more excellent. If the practice becomes too arduous, one may simply follow the old method. In ancient times, Master Yusha, Beilizi, and the Elder of Changling all ascended to heaven by this method, never shirking its difficulties.\n\nThis is what is meant by \"cultivating life.\" Merchants toil ceaselessly—how could they fear hardship? Their sole aim is profit. If seekers of the Dao were as single-minded as merchants, how could they fail to attain immortality? Yet most beginners claim devotion and diligence, only to grow lax afterward, like a cart on the verge of collapse whose every joint loosens, or an ox burdened with a heavy load struggling on a long journey. Such are the afflictions of the unaccomplished, and the amusement of the attained. All such matters are of this kind. If one’s heart is refined as an inner mirror, it will resonate with the divine, and spiritual beings may awaken one’s ignorance, bearing the chariot of the stars and light.\n\n**Arrangement of the Five Planets Diagram**\nIt should always face south, with Venus positioned in the west and Jupiter in the east, following the prescribed order. The reason is that the Five Planets conceal and reveal themselves unpredictably, unlike the Northern Dipper, whose fixed form eternally determines its position in the five directions. Thus, one cannot follow the planets’ shifting locations.\n\nThe Perfected of Primordial Simplicity said: When stepping the Five Planets, before first mounting the stellar *gang* and after descending from it, one must first visualize the essence of the Five Planets within the Five Viscera. Upon completing the visualization, knock the teeth five times, swallow saliva five times, and softly recite the incantation:\n*\"The Five Celestial Bodies array in splendor, illuminating the five directions.\nThe Water Star averts calamity; the Wood Star brings prosperity.\nThe Radiant Deluder dispels misfortune; Venus repels warfare.\nSaturn guards the four quarters; I attain favorable augury.\nMy name is inscribed on jade tablets, recorded in the Emperor’s chamber.\nRiding the whirlwind and fanning the light, I soar through the Great Void,\nEmerging and entering the unseen, roaming and feasting in the ten directions.\nFive-colored clouds cover me; I summon spirits and command the winds,\nEnlisting the myriad numina, ascending as an Immortal Duke.\"*\nThis is recited while facing the *gang* with a focused mind, during the moments of ascent and descent.\n\n**The Five Planetary Sovereigns and Their Consorts**\n- **Eastern Jupiter, True Sovereign Lord:** Name: Chenglan, style: Qingning. His Lady: Baorong, style: Feiyun.\n- **Southern Mars, True Sovereign Lord:** Name: Weiting, style: Sanrong. His Lady: Huaping, style: Xuanluo.\n- **Central Saturn, True Sovereign Lord:** Name: Zanglu, style: Danyan. His Lady: Kongyao, style: Feixian.\n- **Western Venus, True Sovereign Lord:** Name: Liaoling, style: Zhenxun. His Lady: Souying, style: Lingen.\n- **Northern Mercury, True Sovereign Lord:** Name: Xianxuan, style: Jingyuan. His Lady: Xuanhua, style: Long’e.\n\nHolding the breath to mount the *gang*, first invoke the names of the Five Planets and their Ladies. Only then cross the *gang* and tread upon the stars. Begin by lifting both feet onto Venus, then ascend from Venus to Saturn, from Saturn to Mars, from Mars to Jupiter, from Jupiter to Mercury, and from Mercury return to tread upon Venus. After three complete cycles, hold the breath again to mount the *gang*, following the old method of traversing back and forth fifteen times. Upon reaching each planet’s position, invoke the names of the Sovereign Lord and his Lady, press the left hand to the heart, and recite the incantation.\n\nThe text states: When performing the ritual, one should face north while holding the concealed script, for beginners of the true and wondrous Dao, unfamiliar with the subtleties of stellar positions and the Dipper’s directional shifts, must face north while holding the text to gradually grasp its meaning. Once the script’s intent is understood and the stars’ movements with the seasons are recognized, one should naturally follow the Dipper’s orientation, pacing and visualizing accordingly. Thus, there is no fixed direction, and one need not always face north. Facing north is solely for beginners. This principle may be extended by analogy—no further questions are needed.\n\nThe Three Eights and the Twenty-Four Spirits may be recited in sequence, or all three Eights may be visualized at once. Alternatively, one may visualize the Upper Radiance at dawn, the Middle Radiance at noon, and the Lower Radiance at midnight—this depends on the practitioner’s intention. If one retreats to a secluded cliff, free from worldly affairs, and inwardly focuses on the Spirit Gate while absorbing the morning qi of the true, one may visualize the Three Eights at dawn, then reinforce each of the three periods with an additional visualization—this is even more excellent. However, worldly affairs often hinder consistent practice, and irregularity diminishes its benefits. In ancient times, the Perfected Lord of Xicheng and the Supreme Immortal of Tongwu both followed this Dao.",

      "translated_text": "From the *Baoxuan Yulu Baijian Qingjing* it is said: Those who do not visualize the Twenty-Four Spirits or know the names of the Three Eights Radiance cannot be counted among the people of Great Peace, nor can they become ministers to the Later Sage.\n\nThe Primordial Perfected One of Great Simplicity said: If one wishes to transform and divide the body, conceal oneself in the eight directions, hide the form and conceal the radiance, enter emptiness and create darkness, summon the myriad things, and pursue and capture all evils, one must constantly cultivate the refined contemplation of the *Kongchang* (Space-Constant). This practice should also be performed on the Eight Seasonal Nodes and the Six Ding Days. If these coincide with double days, the practice may be repeated. Alternatively, one may perform it after pacing the *gang* (cosmic steps)—this is also excellent. Such is the Dao of concealment and disappearance.\n\nAbove the *Kongchang* *gang*, there are twenty-five black dots:\n\n1. The first dot is named *Jiuchang* (Nine-Constant), where one may reside to escape form.\n2. The second dot is named *Yuchang* (Nurturing-Constant), where one may transform the body into the myriad grasses and trees.\n3. The third dot is named *Maochang* (Mao-Constant), where one may transform the body into the myriad mountains and hills.\n4. The fourth dot is named *Liuchang* (Flowing-Constant), where one may escape *qi* and transform *qi*.\n5. The fifth dot is named *Xingchang* (Moving-Constant), where one may escape fire.\n6. The sixth dot is named *Shangchang* (Upper-Constant), where one appears to others as if between heaven and earth.\n7. The seventh dot is named *Tianchang* (Heaven-Constant), where one may escape fire.\n8. The eighth dot is named *Xuanchang* (Mystery-Constant), where one may escape water.\n9. The ninth dot is named *Sanchang* (Three-Constant), where one may escape weapons.\n10. The tenth dot is named *Chenchang* (Chen-Constant), where one may escape death.\n11. The eleventh dot is the central *Zhuchu* (Prayer-Point) of *Kongchang*, representing the heart.\n12. The twelfth dot is named *Hechang* (River-Constant), where one may transform into water and fire.\n13. The thirteenth dot is named *Yuanchang* (Origin-Constant), where one may dwell and transform into grasses and trees.\n14. The fourteenth dot is named *Guchang* (Ancient-Constant), where one may dwell and transform into birds at will.\n15. The fifteenth dot is named *Sichang* (Si-Constant), where one may transform the body into birds and beasts.\n16. The sixteenth dot is named *Jiuchang* (Nine-Constant), where one may escape misfortune.\n17. The seventeenth dot is named *Shichang* (World-Constant), where one may escape spirits.\n18. The eighteenth dot is named *Mingchang* (Bright-Constant), where one may escape water and become earth.\n19. The nineteenth dot is named *Yuchang* (Jade-Constant), where one may dwell and become a tiger.\n20. The twentieth dot is named *Fachang* (Dharma-Constant), where one may transform the body into a thousand forms.\n21. The twenty-first dot is named *Yinchang* (Yin-Constant), where one may dwell and transform into a dragon.\n22. The twenty-second dot is named *Huangchang* (Yellow-Constant), where one may transform into a woman and divide the body into a hundred forms.\n23. The twenty-third dot is named *Dingchang* (Stable-Constant), where one may dwell and transform into the myriad things at will.\n24. The twenty-fourth dot is named *Feichang* (Flying-Constant), where one may escape the body as the six domestic animals, unseen by others.\n25. The twenty-fifth dot is named *Liuchang* (Six-Constant), where one may escape ghosts that kill people.\n\nThe method of pacing the *Kongchang* *gang* begins at *Jiuchang*. Each time one reaches the eleventh central star, one should softly recite the prayer:\n*\"The Four Brightnesses of the Upper Origin, the radiance of sun and moon, flowing light resplendent, the twenty-five stars, pour liquid to congeal the hun-soul, spirit-water disperses form, washes away filth and purifies, penetrating the dark and obscure. Jade tablets and blue registers, tall and inscribed with names, stone mirrors and jade horses, revealing the forms of ghosts. Conceal the body in the numinous weft, ascend to pay homage to the Upper Clarity.\"*\n\nWithin the first star of the Dipper lies the Inner Consort of the *Taiqing* (Great Clarity) Center, the Transformer, Concealer, and Escapist, named *Kongchang Fayuan*, with the style *Xin Zhengpi*. She wears a yellow brocade cloak and a cinnabar-green flying skirt.\n\nThe second star is the Inner Concubine of Embryo Transformation and Form Protection, named *Kongchang Sanci*, with the style *Luo Zhuying*. She wears a blue brocade cloak and a green-feathered flying skirt.\n\nThe third true star is the Upper Origin Primordial Mother of the Six Escapes and Seven Concealments, named *Kongchang Lingyi*, with the style *Chong Shuangzhao*. She wears a blue brocade cloak and an embroidered feathered skirt.\n\nThe fourth star of the *Niu* (Handle) is the Inner Consort of Concealed Radiance and Hidden Light, named *Kongchang Qilie*, with the style *Heng Danpan*. She is draped in a purple brocade robe and wears a yellow-feathered skirt.\n\nThe fifth star of the *Gang* (Net) is the Great Maiden of the Dipper’s Center, the Transformer of Body and Changer of Radiance, named *Kongchang Yushu*, with the style *Chou Qiulan*. She wears a vermilion brocade cloak and a purple-green flying skirt.\n\nThe sixth star of the *Ji* (Record) is the Middle Maiden of the Dipper’s Center, the Concealer of Traces and Disperser of Images, named *Kongchang Qijing*, with the style *Bao Dingling*. She wears a vermilion brocade cloak and a blue-embroidered flying skirt.\n\nThe seventh star of the *Guan* (Pass) is the Young Maiden of the Dipper’s Center, the Divider of Radiance into Myriad Forms, named *Kongchang Yumo*, with the style *Tian Fanshu*. She wears a cinnabar brocade cloak and a blue-feathered skirt.\n\nThe eighth star of the *Di* (Emperor) is the Left Consort of the High Sovereign of the Dipper’s Center, the Transformer of Sun, Moon, Water, and Fire, named *Kongchang Shi Qizhu*, with the style *Luo Maohua*. She wears a purple brocade cloak and an embroidered feathered skirt.\n\nThe ninth star of the *Zun* (Honored) is the Right Consort of the High Sovereign of the Dipper’s Center, the Transformer of Metal, Stone, Mountains, and Rivers, named *Kongchang Ai Shangtiao*, with the style *Ling Yu Xuan*. She wears a green brocade cloak and a kingfisher-feathered skirt.\n\nAll nine wear their hair in cloud-like topknots.\n\nTo ascend the *gang* while holding the breath, one must first call the names of the nine stellar Inner Consorts, then step upon the stars.\n\nThe *Tai Bai* (Venus) star lies horizontally, its rays scattering like the edges of a blade. One then exhales the *Three Separates* and *Two Golden Flowers*, causing the *Tu Fei* (Chart Boiling) to fill the *Zeng Yu* (Augmented Realm) and the *Liu Chang* (Flowing Field). The *Xuan Shi* (Mysterious Chamber) is the bright and dense *Tai Bai* star. It moves horizontally, its rays scattering like the edges of a blade, spreading across the nine heavens.\n\nThe Perfected One, visualizing this star with its seven rays, constantly exhales the three western rays and draws in the two southern rays. Thus, the golden radiance pierces the eyes, the chart becomes luminous and seething, penetrating the entire body. Once penetrated, one may enter the stellar deities’ *Zeng Yu* and *Liu Yang* palaces. Within these palaces lies the *Xuan Shi*, where one may wander in tranquility and be revered as a Perfected One. These are the names of the chambers within the *Tai Bai* star.\n\nRegarding the practice of the *Tai Shang Yin Shu* (Supreme Perfected’s Concealment Writ), the scripture states: When performing the practice, one should face north while holding the *Yin Shu* (Concealment Writ). This is because beginners in the true and wondrous have not yet ventured into the subtle and distant, do not understand the orientation of stellar positions, nor recognize the Dipper’s directional alignment. Thus, they should face north while holding the writ, gradually seeking understanding. Once the meaning of the writ is grasped and the turning of the stars is recognized with the seasons, one may naturally follow the Dipper’s alignment and pace accordingly. In this way, there is no fixed direction, and one need not always face north. Facing north is merely for beginners.\n\nPerhaps this can be understood by analogy, and no further questions are needed.\n\nThe Perfected One of the Supreme practices the pacing of the Five Stars’ Dao to summon the descent of the Five Stars into their chambers. While holding the breath to ascend the *gang*, one must first call the names of the Five Stellar Lords and Royal Consorts, then step over the *gang* and tread upon the stars.",

      "translated_text": "To ascend the *gang*, one should pause immediately upon reaching it and call the names, then step over the *gang* and tread upon the stars. If, upon arriving at each star, one again focuses the mind and calls the name of that star’s position, it is even better. Should this prove too cumbersome for regular practice, one may proceed as before.\n\nIn ancient times, Master Yushai, Beili Zisheng, and the Elder of Changling all followed this method to ascend to heaven, undeterred by its complexity. This is akin to the way of managing life. Do merchants, in their eagerness for profit, shrink from peril or hardship? Their sole aim is wealth. If seekers of the Dao were as single-minded as merchants, what could prevent them from attaining immortality?\n\nYet beginners often claim devotion and diligence, only to grow lax and negligent thereafter—like a cart on the verge of collapse, its joints scattering, or an ox burdened with weight, its hooves faltering on a long journey. Such are the failings of late learners, the very ones whom the accomplished mock.\n\nIf one can inwardly refine the mind as a mirror, this will stir the numinous. Then, divine beings may awaken one’s obscurity and bear one aloft in the chariot of celestial radiance.\n\nWhen arranging the diagram of the Five Stars, one should face south, with Venus positioned in the west and Jupiter in the east, proceeding accordingly. The reason for this is that the Five Stars conceal and reveal themselves unpredictably, shifting without constancy. Unlike the Northern Dipper, which maintains its fixed form and determines the positions of the five directions, one cannot follow the stars’ transient locations.\n\nThe Three Eights, combined with the Twenty-Four Spirits, may be recited in sequence. Alternatively, one may invoke all Three Eights at once, or store the Upper Radiance at dawn, the Middle Radiance at noon, and the Lower Radiance at midnight—this is left to the practitioner’s intention.\n\nIf one retreats to a secluded cliff, cutting off worldly affairs, and inwardly focuses on the Spirit Gate while gathering the morning’s true qi, then at dawn one may invoke all Three Eights at once, and in each of the three periods, further store one radiance—this would be even better. However, worldly matters often make such consistent practice difficult. Infrequent practice yields only meager benefits.\n\nIn ancient times, the Perfected Lord of Xicheng and the Supreme One of Tongwu both followed this Dao.\n\nAs the *Baoxuan Yulu Baijian Qingjing* states: \"Those who do not store the Twenty-Four Spirits or know the names of the Three Eights cannot be counted among the people of Great Peace, nor can they serve as ministers to the Later Sage. When receiving the *Dadong Zhenjing*, one should also receive the methods of the Supreme Dao. One’s robes and headscarves must not be lent to others, nor should one share vessels, carriages, clothing, beds, or sleeping quarters. This is to block the paths of filth and impurity and guard against the intrusion of perverse winds.\"\n\nThis is easily practiced, yet deemed difficult—such is the way of those whose faith in the Dao is not sincere, who aspire to fly yet sink instead.\n\nFor those cultivating the Grotto Chamber and pacing the Seven Origins, upon first rising from sleep, when first venturing out, and after meals, one should softly recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Five August Ones, Five Penetrations,\nJade Script of the Grotto Chamber,\nReturn to the Hidden Dao,\nExpand the Seven Dawns.\nThe Mysterious Father gives birth to the hun-soul,\nTransforming the One into spirit.\nThe Mysterious Mother gives birth to the po-soul,\nTransforming the Two into body.\nThe Duke’s Son gathers my sinews and bones,\nWhite Prime governs my essence and qi.\nLong life and enduring vision,\nAscend as an immortal to the Ten Heavens.\"*\n\nThis must be recited without letting the ears hear the sound. This is the Supreme One’s hidden incantation, used to dispel perverse qi and summon spirit, enabling transformation, division of form, concealment in the eight directions, vanishing of the body, hiding of radiance, entering emptiness, and traversing darkness. It allows one to summon the myriad things, hunt down all treacheries, and cultivate the refined contemplation of the Void and Constancy.\n\nOne should pace the Void and Constancy *gang* once every seven days, as one would pace the Seven Origins. This may be done at midnight, noon, or dawn, within a quiet chamber. It should also be practiced on the eight solar terms and the six Ding days. If these coincide with doubled days, one may perform it twice, or pace it again after completing the steps—this is also good. This is the essential Dao of concealment and vanishing.\n\nUpon the Void and Constancy *gang* are twenty-five black dots:\n\n1. The first dot is the earthly name *Nine Constancies*, where one may escape form. Its taboo name is *Yingyu*, and its style is *Tongjiao*.\n2. The second dot is named *Yuchang*, where one may transform the body into the myriad grasses and trees. Its name is *Huantong*, and its style is *Youyuan*.\n3. The third dot is named *Maochang*, where one may transform the body into the myriad mountains and hills. Its name is *Jinshang*, and its style is *Haoting*.\n4. The fourth dot is named *Liuchang*, where one may escape qi and transform qi. Its name is *Guqing*, and its style is *Taoji*.\n5. The fifth dot is named *Xingchang*, where one may escape fire. Its name is *Haozhao*, and its style is *Xuansheng*.\n6. The sixth dot is named *Shangchang*, where people see one as ascending to heaven and descending to earth. Its name is *Huangguang*, and its style is *Yuanlang*.\n7. The seventh dot is named *Tianchang*, where one may escape fire. Its name is *Liaotiao*, and its style is *Zhuodu*.\n8. The eighth dot is named *Xuanchang*, where one may escape water. Its name is *Kongtiao*, and its style is *Xiaxuan*.\n9. The ninth dot is named *Sanchang*, where one may escape weapons. Its name is *Tengmin*, and its style is *Yunbian*.\n10. The tenth dot is named *Chenchang*, where one may escape death. Its name is *Neiyi*, and its style is *Yiwei*.\n11. The eleventh dot is the central incantation point of the Void and Constancy, the heart. Its name is *Dangyang*, and its style is *Yuanyuan*.\n12. The twelfth dot is named *Hechang*, where one may transform into water and fire. Its name is *Liujing*, and its style is *Qizhuan*.\n13. The thirteenth dot is named *Yuanchang*, where one may dwell and transform into grasses and trees. Its name is *Nanzhi*, and its style is *Jingji*.\n14. The fourteenth dot is named *Guchang*, where one may dwell and transform into birds at will. Its name is *Dongsheng*, and its style is *Weitong*.\n15. The fifteenth dot is named *Jichang*, where one may transform the form into birds and beasts. Its name is *Lixing*, and its style is *Houhua*.\n16. The sixteenth dot is named *Jiuchang*, where one may escape misfortune. Its name is *Qingbao*, and its style is *Shangyang*.\n17. The seventeenth dot is named *Shichang*, where one may escape spirits. Its name is *Cangyuan*, and its style is *Changming*.\n18. The eighteenth dot is named *Mingchang*, where one may escape water and become earth. Its name is *Biyuan*, and its style is *Dongsheng*.\n19. The nineteenth dot is named *Yuchang*, where one may dwell and become a tiger. Its name is *Guiqing*, and its style is *Yuyang*.\n20.

When holding the breath to ascend the *gāng*, first call the names of the Five Stars and their consorts, then step over the *gāng* and tread upon the stars. Begin by raising both feet onto the Great White Star, then proceed from the White to the Quelling Star, from the Quelling to the Fire Star, from the Fire to the Wood Star, from the Wood to the Water Star, and from the Water back to the Great White. Repeat this thrice, then hold the breath again to ascend the *gāng*, following the established path fifteen times. At each star, call the names of the August Lords and their consorts, press the left hand to the heart, and recite the invocation.\n\n**First, the Great White Star:**\nYellow brocade mantle, vermilion and azure flying skirts.\n\n**Second, the Origin Star:**\nAzure brocade mantle, green feathered flying skirts.\n\n**Third, the True Star:**\nAzure brocade mantle, embroidered feathered ceremonial skirts.\n\n**Fourth, the Tie Star:**\nPurple brocade mantle, yellow flowered feathered skirts.\n\n**Fifth, the Net Star:**\nCrimson brocade mantle, purple and azure flying skirts.\n\n**Sixth, the Record Star:**\nCrimson brocade mantle, azure embroidered flying skirts.\n\n**Seventh, the Barrier Star:**\nVermilion brocade mantle, azure flowered feathered skirts.\n\n**Eighth, the Imperial Star:**\nPurple brocade mantle, embroidered feathered flying skirts.\n\n**Ninth, the Venerable Star:**\nGreen brocade mantle, kingfisher feathered ceremonial skirts.\nAll wear cloud-coiled topknots.\n\nFor the method of pacing the *Kōngcháng* Dao, begin at the ninth dot, *Jiǔcháng*. Each time you reach the eleventh dot, the Central Star, softly recite the invocation:\n*\"The Four Luminaries of the Upper Origin, the radiance of sun and moon,\nStreaming light resplendent, the Twenty-Five Stars,\nInfuse the elixir and congeal the soul, divine water disperses form.\nWashing away defilement and refining purity, penetrating the dark and unseen,\nNames inscribed on Jade Tablets and Azure Records, carved in the High Pavilion.\nStone mirrors and jade steeds reveal the forms of ghosts;\nConcealing the body with sacred talismans, I ascend to pay homage in the Upper Clarity.\"*\n\n**Eastern Year Star August Lord:** Chénglán Qīngníng\n**Consort:** Bǎoróng Fēiyún\n\n**Southern Radiant Star August Lord:** Wéitíng Sànróng\n**Consort:** Huápíng Xuánluó\n\n**Central Quelling Star August Lord:** Cánglù Dānyán\n**Consort:** Kōngyáo Fēixián\n\n**Western Great White Star August Lord:** Liáolíng Zhènxún\n**Consort:** Biāoyīng Líng’ēn\n\n**Northern Water Star August Lord:** Xiánxuān Jīngyuán\n**Consort:** Xuánhuá Lóng’é\n\n**The Flying Pacing of the *Kōngcháng* Chart**\n**Essential Instructions for Cultivating the *Kōngcháng* Method**\n\nWhenever one wishes to pace the *Kōngcháng*, fly the *gāng*, escape form, transform appearance, and ascend to the Jade Clarity, perform the practice seven times in a month.

On the appointed day, enter the chamber, burn incense on both sides, spread out the chart and mat, face south, click the teeth twenty-four times, close the eyes, and visualize the Five Stars shining brilliantly in the five directions. After a long while, see them descend and enter the five viscera: the Metal Star into the Lung Palace, the Earth Star into the Spleen Palace, the Fire Star into the Heart Palace, the Wood Star into the Liver Palace, and the Water Star into the Kidney Palace. The Five Stars radiate light, illuminating the five viscera, and the body feels warm. Then visualize the August Consorts of the Five Stars and the names and attire of the Twenty-Five *Kōngcháng* August Lords and Morning Lords, each in their respective directions. When all is complete, softly recite the invocation:\n*\"Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth, the primal qi of the Four Origins,\nMysterious essence flowing and shining, illuminating the Five Luminaries.\nWithin are the Five Stars, the numinous lords and consorts,\nThe Twenty-Five Dots, the *Kōngcháng* Celestial Worthies,\nTransforming and dividing forms a thousandfold and myriadfold,\nDescending into the five viscera, coalescing into Jade Immortals.\nRefining my seven *pò*, nurturing my three *hún*,\nI raise my form to ascend, flying into the Dipper’s Gate,\nRoaming and playing in the Upper Capital, the Five Stars gathering in throngs.\nToday, in this mysterious celebration, I request that all be as recited.\"*\n\nDraw in the starlight and qi, swallowing twenty-five times, then rise to pace the *gāng*.

Stand with feet together on the Quelling Star, hold the breath for twelve cycles, face southwest, look up to the heavens, and softly recite:\n*\"The Central August Four Qi, overseeing the Eight Numinous Ones,\nJade Terrace and Purple Chamber, where divine dots give birth to transformations.\nWithin is the Origin Star, the Five Emperors’ hidden names,\nCalled Cángduì, pacifying the Yellow Court,\nClad in flying cloud sashes, crowned with flowered essence,\nHolding talismans and wielding battle-axes, resplendent with falling fire bells,\nEnabling my flying pace, revealing to me the divine names,\nDescending into the Spleen Palace, pacifying spirit and settling essence,\nAscending to heaven and entering the clouds, concealing form and escaping shape,\nTransforming the myriad things, roaming the Jade Clarity,\nAttaining union with the August Lord, together preserving the Great Luminosity.\"*",

emerging from yin into yang,\nThey summon the Three Thunders, commanding the Earth Officials,\nEnabling my flying steps to escape the sun’s shadow into the great void,\nWherever I turn, my form divides in a hundred directions.\nAscending to the Celestial Hook, I rise to Jade Capital,\nMy body sprouting wondrous fur, my kidney palace receiving fragrance.\nToday I practice the Dao, the ancestral way of divine transcendents,\nAttaining the celestial vow, enjoying boundless blessings.\nDraw in qi and swallow five times to conclude.\n\nWhen the steps of the Constant Capital are complete, descend through the gate,\nKnock teeth thirty-six times, face the celestial stem and chant the *Three Caverns Flying Steps* chapter.\nTake nine steps to ascend the Yang Brightness Star, join feet and face east, invoking:\n\"Concealing Transformation, Hidden Escape, Inner Consort of the Supreme Palace,\nGreat Divinity Supreme Unity, Supreme Venerable One,\nWho oversees the registers of

Prime Palace,\nWho nurtures my embryonic birth, conceals me in the golden chamber,\nTransforms my ascent to the azure carriage,\nGrant me flight through the void, boundless years.\"\n\nNext ascend the Mysterious Darkness, face north and invoke:\n\"Inner Consort of Concealed Radiance and Hidden Light in the Cord of Darkness Palace,\nGreat Ancestral Spirit of Divine Transcendents, Numinous

Palace,\nSupreme Venerable Empress,\nWho unites with the numinous in the Flowery Chamber,\nHeavenly soul and earthly spirit,\nStyled the Supreme Void,\nTransforming the nine qi,\nAncestral progenitor of the myriad Perfected,\nRevolving metal and turning stone,\nAchieving merit equal to heaven,\nDissolving mountains and drying rivers,\nSummoning clouds and calling dragons,\nThe ten thousand anomalies responding instantly,\nDividing my radiance into a hundred million transformations,\nFlying steps treading the void,\nFlowing brilliance to the four directions,\nConcealing my body in the
