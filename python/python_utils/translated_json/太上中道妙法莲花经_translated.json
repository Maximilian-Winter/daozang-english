The Primordial Vast Net**\nAt that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Origin, long ago in the Heaven of the Great Vast Net, within the Palace of Vast Transformations, assembled the hosts of heavenly immortals and expounded the Ten Extremities and the Five Uninterrupted Hells.\n\nThen, among the assembly, there was a perfected one named Zuo Xuan, who knelt before the Dao and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: \"What are the Ten Extremities and the Five Uninterrupted Hells?\"\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy spoke in verse:\n*\"The Boundless fills the empty realm,*\n*Yet sentient beings have never heard.*\n*I gather the hosts of immortals*\n*To broadly expound the gates of liberation.*\n*Cease the bitterness of hell’s torment,*\n*Now awakened as heavenly immortals.*\n*Chants descend from the void,*\n*Sun and moon illuminate the jade terrace.*\n*Hearing the immortals’ words of liberation,*\n*The true immortals rejoice greatly.*\n*They then follow the immortals,*\n*Providing all that is needed.*\n*Gathering firewood and fruits,*\n*Supplying them in due season.*\n*With minds devoted to the wondrous Dharma assembly,*\n*They diligently practice without weariness.*\n*Universally for all sentient beings,*\n*They cultivate the great Dharma.*\n*Wishing to protect their own bodies,*\n*Along with the five grains and medicines.*\n*Thus, for the great kings,*\n*They seek to safeguard this Dharma.*\n*Thereby attaining immortality,*\n*Now I explain it for you.\"*\n\nThen, the Heavenly Worthy addressed the hosts of immortals: \"I now expound this wondrous Dharma for you, so that boundless sentient beings may all attain liberation.\"\n\nImmediately, the hosts of heavenly immortals scattered flower petals, finest incense, sandalwood, aloes, bedding, garments, jeweled ornaments, banners, canopies, and celestial music. They offered these to the seven-jeweled jade terrace, and the immortals and sages of the ten directions, along with boundless sentient beings, took refuge in the immortal Dao.\n\nThen, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy spoke in verse:\n*\"I am the Lord of Heaven,*\n*Dwelling solely in the heavenly realm.*\n*Within the realm of non-action,*\n*Yet I come for the sake of the Dharma.*\n*Why do people not diligently seek the Dharma?*\n*Now the Dharma is profound and mysterious,*\n*Thus I have come here.*\n*For the assembled immortals,*\n*With the power of spiritual penetration,*\n*Like a pure and clean land,*\n*Adorned with lotus flowers.*\n*Beneath those jeweled trees,*\n*All is resplendent with jade.*\n*Fragrant scents emanate from their bodies,*\n*Pervading all the heavenly realms.*\n*Sentient beings, as if perfumed,*\n*Rejoice beyond measure,*\n*Like a great wind*\n*Blowing the branches of small trees.*\n*By this expedient means,*\n*I propagate the Dharma.*\n*I ask the great immortals:*\n*After I conceal myself in the void,*\n*Who will uphold, read, and expound this sutra?*\n*Now, before this assembly,*\n*Declare your vows.*\n*Though Zuo Xuan the Perfected has long concealed himself in the void,*\n*He roars like a lion.*\n*The Primordial Heavenly Worthy,*\n*With his great vows,*\n*Has manifested transformation bodies—*\n*Know this intention,*\n*And that of my own body.*\n*Know this intention, all true disciples:*\n*Whoever upholds the Dharma*\n*Is making offerings to me.*\n*I and Zuo Xuan*\n*Together practice the wondrous Dharma;*\n*This You Xuan*\n*Roams the ten directions.*\n*For the sake of this sutra,*\n*They also make offerings*\n*To the transforming immortals,*\n*Adorning them with radiant splendor.*\n*In all worlds,*\n*Wherever this sutra is expounded,*\n*There the transforming immortals appear,*\n*Along with the hosts of immortals.\"*\n\n#### **2. The Great Transformations**\nThen, among the assembly, the good men each listened and reflected: \"This is a difficult matter; one should make great vows.\"\n\n\"Though the scriptures are countless, and expounding them is not difficult; even if one could toss Mount Sumeru to another realm, this would not be difficult; even if one could move the immortal realms with a toe and cast them into distant lands, this would not be difficult; even if one stood atop the highest peak and expounded this sutra in an evil age, this would be difficult.\n\n\"Even if one could hold the empty void and wander through it, this would not be difficult; if, after my return to heaven, one were to copy this sutra oneself or have another do so, this would be difficult. Even if one could place the great earth on a toenail and ascend to the Brahma Heaven, this would not be difficult; if, after the immortals’ transformations, one were to briefly read this sutra in an evil age, this would be difficult.\n\n\"If, after the immortals’ transformations, one were to expound this sutra to even one person, this would be difficult. Even if one could hold the eighty-four thousand Dharma repositories, the thirty-six divisions of sacred scriptures, and expound them to others, enabling listeners to attain spiritual penetrations and self-mastery, though this is possible, it would not be difficult; if, after the immortals’ transformations, one were to receive this sutra and inquire into its meaning, this would be difficult.\n\n\"Even if one could expound the Dharma to countless, boundless beings, this would not be difficult; if, after the immortals’ transformations, one could uphold such a sutra, this would be difficult.\n\n\"I have become an immortal in countless lands, from the beginning until now, broadly expounding many scriptures, yet among them, this sutra is foremost. If one receives and upholds it, this is cause for rejoicing. They will then follow the immortals, providing all that is needed—gathering fruits, drawing water, picking vegetables, collecting firewood, preparing vegetarian meals, even offering their own bodies as seats, without weariness of body or mind.\"\n\nAt that time, one who upholds this sutra for a thousand years, seeking the Dharma with diligence, serves tirelessly to ensure nothing is lacking.\n\nThen the Great Dao spoke in verse:\n*\"For the sake of the Dharma, I made my body a servant,\nNever weary in heart.\nNow, having attained immortality,\nWith natural divine powers,\nI guide and instruct the deluded:\nDo not create evil causes,\nFor karmic retribution will surely come.\"*\n\nAt that time, a female immortal named Golden Youth addressed the assembly of heavenly beings:\n*\"In the human realm, good and evil all arise from the mind.\nHell, animal rebirth, womb-born, egg-born, moisture-born—\nAll karmic retributions.\nIf one attains immortality,\nThey escape the three evil destinies.\nHaving liberated countless deluded beings,\nThey gather in assembly to expound this sutra.\nIt is like one who cultivates good fruits,\nAnd all virtuous karma comes to fulfillment.\nIf one follows the path of evil,\nThe karmic cause manifests:\nAs a camel, bearing the suffering of heavy burdens;\nAs a python, enduring the suffering of accumulated poison;\nAs fish and turtles, drifting in the suffering of the depths;\nAs flying birds, trapped in the suffering of nets;\nAs pigs and dogs, enduring the suffering of filth and lowliness;\nAs donkeys and mules, repaying the suffering of debts;\nAs oxen, laboring in the suffering of sowing;\nOr as lowly beings, though with immortal bodies.\"*\n\n*\"All good men,\nAfter my transformation,\nIf you can reverently receive and uphold,\nRecite and study this sutra,\nNow before the Dao, make this vow:\nThis sutra is difficult to uphold;\nEven if upheld but briefly,\nI will rejoice,\nAs will all immortals.\nSuch a person is praised by the heavenly Dao,\nTruly courageous,\nTruly a cultivator of the real.\nPracticing the practice of compassion,\nThey swiftly attain the fruition of immortality.\nThose who, in future lives, uphold and contemplate this sutra\nAre true divine immortals,\nAbiding in the realm of pure goodness,\nTransformed by the Great Dao,\nAble to comprehend its meaning.\nAmong all heavenly beings,\nThey are the eyes of the world,\nIn this age of fear and dread,\nThough they may speak,\nAll immortals should make offerings to them.\"*\n\n*Thus concludes the first scroll of the Supreme Middle Dao Wondrous Dharma Lotus Sutra.*\n\n**Chapter Three: The Immortals and the Great Dao**\n\nAt that time, the Great Dao of the Immortals and the assembly of immortals, in former ages, sought the *Dharma Lotus Sutra* with unwavering hearts, ever upholding the Great Dao among the heavens, pursuing its freedom, their minds undeterred and unscattered.\n\nThen an immortal came and addressed me, saying: *\"I possess a Mahāyāna sutra called the *Wondrous Dharma Lotus Sutra*. If you do not abandon me, I shall expound it for you.\"*\n\nThe Great Dao of the Immortals, upon hearing this, rejoiced. The bitterness of scorn and all sufferings arise from karmic retribution, their manifold causes and conditions without distinction.\n\nThen the Great Dao spoke in verse:\n*\"The deeds of karmic cause remain,\nNot tenfold in their weight alone.\nRetribution comes swift as wind—\nExhort all not to stray therein.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Four: The Practice of Following the Dao**\n\nAt that time, the immortal Asīti, out of compassion for me, bestowed upon me unimpeded wisdom. For the sake of my vows, he enabled all deluded beings to sever their craving and desire, to dispel their afflictions—false lust, deceitful speech, harsh words, divisive tongues, anger, jealousy, hatred, slander, abuse, killing, theft, oppression, scheming, resentment, treachery, and deceit—accumulating the ten unwholesome deeds, ever practicing thus.\n\nHell is swift as an arrow; heaven remains distant. The suffering of beings knows no escape from the wheel. From delusion to eternity, they sink in the sea of suffering, beyond the sight of our heavenly host.\n\nBeyond the azure heavens lie the Jade Terrace and the Purple Palace, where golden sands flow and thoughts cease. Then the Heavenly Worthy, majestic and upright, his brows radiating white light, his mouth exhaling wondrous fragrance, spoke words of freedom.\n\nAmidst the five-colored clouds of the azure heavens, he discoursed on the *Wondrous Dharma Lotus Sutra*. All the heavenly immortals, having heard this sutra, had encountered the immortal Dao in countless kalpas past.\n\nNow was the appointed time—free from sorrow, at ease and joyful, auspicious clouds swirling as they came to welcome them. All rejoiced, took their leave, and departed.\n\n*Thus concludes the second scroll of the* Supreme Middle Dao Wondrous Dharma Lotus Sutra.\n*Beginning of the third scroll of the* Supreme Middle Dao Wondrous Dharma Lotus Sutra.\n\n**The Fifth Chapter: Following the Right Path**\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy assembled the heavenly immortals and all the transformed immortals, who came from the boundless worlds. Each paid homage to the Heavenly Worthy and sat to one side.\n\nThen the Left Mystery Perfected Person rose and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: \"We beseech the Heavenly Worthy, in your great compassion, to take pity on us and expound this wondrous sutra. Now that the transformed immortals have all gathered, those who have practiced for long ages wish to receive the Heavenly Worthy’s merciful instruction.\"\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy spoke to the assembly of Heavenly Worthies and the host of heavenly immortals: \"Since I attained the Dao, I have never heard such a sutra as this, which grants supreme freedom. Now, as you listen and receive it, may you transcend even me.\"\n\nThen he proclaimed in verse:\n*\"I shall transform and deliver,\nRescue those in the Three Wretched Realms,\nSo all immortals may attain the Dao.\nFor a thousand myriad eons,\nI abide in the void,\nManifesting jade terraces\nAmidst azure clouds and celestial thoroughfares.\nHeavenly songs arise spontaneously,\nPhoenixes dance and simurghs sing;\nWondrous fragrances emerge,\nClouds form chariots in the sky.\nRoaming the worlds, I pause\nTo end the suffering of hell.\nFree from sorrow, free from care,\nAs if drinking sweet dew.\nBorn of the Great Dao,\nAided by divine immortals,\nI enable liberation,\nDispel perverse thoughts in an instant,\nSpare them from the wheel of rebirth,\nAnd forever sever the Three Wretched Realms.\nCultivate the mind of equanimity,\nFor I only relieve suffering.\nLet the six senses remain pure,\nAnd the thousand evils depart;\nUnobstructed wisdom shall spread,\nLongevity shall naturally flourish.\nThe Dao’s far-reaching teachings\nAre borne close by all beings.\nAt the moment of liberation,\nThey reach the path of divine immortals,\nAttaining purity and joy,\nPracticing the rain of compassion,\nHealing the illnesses of beings,\nForever chanting wondrous words.\"*\n\n**The Sixth Chapter: The Parable of Far-Reaching Teachings**\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy addressed the heavenly assembly, expounding the meaning of the boundless void, so that the countless hosts might attain spontaneous divine transformations.\n\n*\"When I speak of the Yellow Court, the Left Mystery embodies me;\nWhen I speak of the Profound Mystery, the Right Mystery comprehends me;\nWhen I speak of non-action, Yin Xi is my companion;\nWhen I speak of longevity, the Celestial Mandate endures,\nScattered among humankind as the great father of medicine.\nI possess a wondrous sutra\nThat enables all beings to transcend the Nine Grades.\"*\n\nThen the Heavenly Worthy praised in verse:\n*\"Some immortal disciples\nDwell in deep grottoes,\nCultivating the mind and refining elixirs,\nSeeking the profound Dao.\nSome immortal disciples\nAbide in the dusty world,\nManifesting boundless wisdom,\nSeeking the profound Dao.\nSome immortal disciples\nPractice the wondrous Dharma of purity,\nSaving sentient beings,\nSeeking the profound Dao.\nSome immortal disciples\nSit by the eastern sea,\nFor a thousand myriad years,\nSeeking the profound Dao.\nSome immortal disciples\nSurpass others in wisdom and learning,\nMastering texts and scriptures,\nSeeking the profound Dao.\nSome immortal disciples\nFast and consume pine and cypress,\nPlay the zither with water, fire, and heart,\nSeeking the profound Dao.\nSome immortal disciples\nWield swords in the wilderness,\nSubduing the ten kinds of demons,\nSeeking the profound Dao.\nSome immortal disciples\nMaster talismans, incantations, and spells,\nDispelling misfortune and banishing ghosts,\nSeeking the profound Dao.\nSome immortal disciples\nRide blue simurghs over the sea,\nFerrying beings to the immortal Dao,\nSeeking the profound Dao.\nSome immortal disciples\nHold sutras and recite cavern scriptures,\nSaving ordinary mortals,\nSeeking the profound Dao.\"*\n\nWhen the Primordial Heavenly Worthy had finished reciting the verse, the Boundless Heavenly Worthy in the assembly declared: \"Having heard this sutra, the ninefold mysteries and seven generations of ancestors all ascend to the heavenly palaces—how much more so the suffering beings of the world, who shall surely transcend all! Even the five uninterrupted hells and the boundless agonies dissolve like frost beneath the scorching sun. All who were blind and deaf shall gain keen sight and hearing; all who were poor and destitute shall attain wealth and honor; all who were deranged shall recover their true nature.\"\n\nThose who were lowly and impoverished shall ascend to lofty heights;\nThose afflicted with grievous illness shall be fully healed;\nThose who were mute and voiceless shall gain the power of speech;\nThose who were blind shall behold radiant light;\nThose who were lame shall walk with ease;\nThose heavy with child shall move with lightness;\nThose bound by lust shall be freed from its chains;\nThose shrouded in ignorance shall cast off their delusion;\nThose consumed by wrath shall forsake their anger;\nThose steeped in the Five Turbidities shall be reborn as men;\nThose who were dead shall be restored to life;\nThose haunted by malevolent spirits shall banish them afar;\nThose drained by depletion shall be filled with abundance;\nThose given to theft and violence shall embrace compassion;\nThose tormented by famine shall know satiety;\nThose threatened by conflagration shall see the flames extinguished;\nThose imperiled by flood shall stand upon dry land.\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy addressed the assembly of celestial immortals: \"When I first sought the great Dao, beings from the five directions came forth, each expounding upon the empty realms, yet all speaking with one voice. I pointed to the great Dao, and my cry resounded through the ten directions, startling gods and spirits. I also heard that in the upper realms, the Dao once proclaimed by the heavenly beings manifests in boundless transformations. When sentient beings seek the great Dao, I shall aid their path, hastening their attainment.\"\n\nThen the great assembly stirred, and celestial music arose spontaneously in the void to welcome them. Those who cultivate the fruits of the Dao shall be free from hatred and attachment, ignorance and arrogance, wrath and fury, frivolity and lust, deceitful speech and slander. They shall practice boundless generosity, relieving poverty and delivering the suffering.\n\nThereupon, the Long-Lived Perfected One rose and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: \"May I swiftly attain the great Dao.\"\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy preached the Dharma for me, and from birth until now, I had never heard such a sutra—thus attaining purity. Now I beseech the Heavenly Worthy to expound it once more, that all beings upon the great earth may be transformed and spared the three evil destinies. Some beings engage in deceit and falsehood; some defile and disdain the Three Treasures; some persist in theft and malice; some take lives and harm beings; some practice all manner of unwholesome deeds—let them all abandon evil and return to the right path. Then, weary of their misdeeds, they shall advance before the sages, ascending to the Azure Heavens, where boundless joy awaits. Ever shall they hear the celestial drums, the music and hymns of the heavens, unceasing, as the heavenly beings guide them. Thenceforth, they shall forever depart the three evil destinies, roaming the celestial realms, their bodies liberated, aiding the Dao and its teachings for myriad ages.\"\n\nAll the divine assembly of celestial sages bowed and withdrew.\n\n*Thus concludes the third scroll of the Supreme Central Dao Wondrous Dharma Lotus Sutra.*\n\n**Supreme Central Dao Wondrous Dharma Lotus Sutra, Scroll the Fourth**\n**Chapter Seven: Liberation**\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Celestial Worthy addressed the assembly of heavenly beings: \"From ancient times until now, none have heard the supreme scriptures. Among the myriad peoples of the great thousand worlds, I roam freely in the Dao and its virtue, delighting in spontaneity.\n\nIn a bygone age, there was a youth who wandered through the kingdoms, endowed with great wisdom and unmatched worldly arts. Whether he entered the mountains and forests or dwelled in cities and towns, he served others as a humble attendant, never idle or remiss. Reborn in joy, he often sang celestial hymns, free from anger or resentment.\n\nOnce, while traveling, he came to a small kingdom and encountered a lofty mountain. Gazing around, he saw clouds and mist swirling, green waters flowing horizontally. The youth then settled upon this mountain, eating pine and cypress at dawn and resting in rocky valleys at dusk. Days passed like months, and he constantly recited the wondrous scriptures.\n\nA white crane descended from the sky, and the youth befriended it. After several hundred years, celestial boys and jade maidens descended to welcome him, and he met the Original Lord, attaining the Dao and returning to the right path. At that time, the youth harbored no stinginess, greed, jealousy, or the five poisons. Having become an immortal, he descended to the world to dispel demonic toxins, save and deliver the people, and cure their illnesses—such was his conduct.\n\nThis immortal was none other than myself.\n\nAgain, I addressed the heavenly assembly: 'I observe that the people below do not cultivate the Ten Wholesome Paths. I shall transform and deliver those who have not yet attained the immortal Dao. Trapped in the world, they cannot escape the cycle of rebirth—like the fleeting brilliance of the sun, like water gathering, like the plantain’s fragility, like the spark struck from stone. Mortals are like a candle in the wind, like the sprout in a plantain grove, like dreams and illusions, like shadows. Though the spark from stone may linger, though lightning may shine constantly, though the form of affliction may endure—now is the very time for immortals to attain the Dao.\n\nThen, I reflected further: Jade maidens and golden youths, riding feathered chariots across the three mountains, come and go between the jeweled terraces and the Purple Mansion, singing amidst the azure heavens beneath the radiance of sun and moon, ever roaming the boundless void.\n\nThe Nine Grades of Peerless Upper Ministers, the Peerless Upper Grade Flowing Rosy Clouds Immortals, and the Peerless Wondrous Grade Left Mystery Immortals—born with me, they dwell in the celestial realms, together discussing the lower world.\n\nYet beings burdened by evil karma who do not cultivate the wondrous Dharma shall never attain liberation.'\"\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Measure of Teaching**\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy addressed the assembly of celestial beings: \"It is like the great sea containing all lesser seas, never overflowing. Now, as you celestial hosts transform and enlighten the deluded multitudes, let the beings of the lower realms below never grow weary. Day and night, with diligent devotion, they must recite the boundless wondrous scriptures a thousand myriad times, contemplating the mind as empty as space.\n\nFurther, they shall manifest wondrous arts, displaying myriad transformations—bodies towering ten thousand *zhang*, heads reaching the heavens, feet treading the great sea, summoning clouds and calling forth rain. From beneath their feet, water flows; from their heads, fire blazes. From their heads, water pours; from their feet, fire erupts. Such divine powers are all for the sake of teaching and transformation.\n\nIf one is gravely ill, they shall manifest as a skilled physician. If one is bound in shackles, they shall manifest liberation. If one is upon a perilous path, they shall manifest a guide. If one is drowning in rivers or lakes, they shall manifest a boat. If one is harmed by demonic spirits, they shall manifest the dispelling of malevolence.\n\nAll things soar through the void—flying dragons and galloping steeds, scattering radiant jade terraces, myriad flutes and songs—so that heavenly beings may hear, hells cease their torments, and all demonic spirits flee far away.\n\nAt that time, a Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct within the assembly spoke these verses:\n\nHeavy emptiness, heaven’s blossoms fill,\nTranscending the Dharma assembly, they come.\nSuch are the transformations of heavenly beings,\nDharma rain moistens the vast sky.\n\nCranes dance by the cinnabar halls,\nPhoenixes sing before hidden grottoes.\nAll numinous signs of the void,\nCountless since time immemorial.\n\nJade maidens and golden youths attend,\nFlowing rosy clouds illuminate the Purple Void.\nSinging upon the Azure Vault Terrace,\nPacing the Void by the decree of the Primordial Sovereign.\n\nTo rescue beings from suffering,\nWhen those below hear,\nDisciples of the Dao, all immortals,\nGreat vows gather in non-action.\nHolding the scriptures deep within caves,\nStudying arts in ancient terraces.\n\nManifesting beyond the world,\nYet not grasping the mysteries of the wondrous scriptures,\nThey cannot avoid meeting the Primordial Sovereign,\nWho expounds subtle and wondrous words.\n\nHearing the *Carefree Chapter*,\nProclaimed together with the *Yellow Court*,\nRain moistens the parched earth’s medicine,\nGradually growing fragrant.\nUpon hearing the true and wondrous Dao,\nOne shall never again encounter the wheel of rebirth.\n\nWhether great or small branches and sprouts,\nThe hundred kinds of grasses and vines,\nAll immortal disciples,\nTogether transcend the mysteries of suffering.\nThey transform the sins of the Nine Dark Realms\nInto weariness for ascent to heaven,\nAll afflictions\nAre purified for the assembly of Perfected Ones.\"\n\n**The Wondrous Dharma Lotus Sutra of the Middle Dao of the Most High, Scroll Four (Ends)**\n\n**The Wondrous Dharma Lotus Sutra of the Middle Dao of the Most High, Scroll Five**\n\n**Chapter Nine: The Nine Dark Realms**\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy spoke of the illnesses of all beings in the lower realms. Devout Daoists were entreated to purify their homes, adorn their dwellings, establish altars, and reverently prepare incense and candles, rare fruits and precious flowers, offering them according to the Dharma. If one recites this wondrous scripture—one scroll, two scrolls, or even seven scrolls—the illness shall be cured, afflictions shall cease, and naturally, coolness and joy shall arise, with boundless suffering forever dispelled.\n\nOr, if one chants over water and sprinkles it upon the sick, they shall attain coolness. If one’s life is ending, instruct them with words, so that the sick may relinquish attachment. All possessions used should be presented before the Three Treasures by the revered master, who shall loudly proclaim the offering. Thus, the life shall be dedicated, and the sick shall perceive impermanence as a dream, spared the bitterness of hellish retribution.\n\nIf this person in a past life made offerings, every coin was received. Even posthumous cultivation was performed with utmost purity, born of sincere reverence, never slighting the sacred Perfected Ones of the Three Treasures. All homeless Daoists of the empty void, their hearts filled with joy, shall fully receive merit, clearly manifesting in future lives.\n\nThe hells and animal realms arise from the mind’s deeds—thousands of transformations, myriad changes. Some take form through transformation, others through womb or egg, receiving life and karma. Even if one’s merit is but a fraction, not half, nor a hundred thousandfold, it cannot compare. Thus, ever-increasing blessings follow, and as one receives life and karma, so it shall be.\n\n**Chapter Ten: The Multitudes of Transformations**\n\nAt that time, the Perfected One of Wondrous Unity ascended and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: \"I shall exhort and transform all beings to swiftly attain immortality.\" Then he spoke these verses:\n\nPraising the wondrous scriptures above,\nAdorned with a hundred treasures’ patterns and hues,\nOffering rare fruits and flowers,\nWith music, grotto hymns, and songs.\n\nHolding banners, encircling,\nWith hearts of abundant offering,\nReverently presenting rare and precious treasures,\nAll to honor the sacred image.\n\nAbandoning all possessions,\nThus attaining a liberated heart,\nMerit surpassing the natural,\nLike flowers, wondrous and joyous.\n\nA thousand sages taught this,\nTen thousand cares forgotten in pursuit.\nAll celestial immortals who come\nUphold the wondrous Dharma scriptures.\n\nSpeaking of love and joy,\nBeings’ karma not yet exhausted,\nWhen karma is spent, merit remains light,\nForever severing the retribution of rebirth.\n\nImmortal music harmonizes,\nWelcoming return to the Nine Terraces,\nTogether speaking of the joy of longevity,\nSuffering and sorrow never intrude.\n\nAzure Vault’s true and wondrous songs,\nImmortal blossoms upon them,\nRare music in the world,\nAt times reaching the Jasper Pool.\n\nMist and rosy clouds, deep and distant,\nSilent and desolate, beyond the perilous streams,\nAutumn winds suffuse the night moon,\nGreen bamboo, emerald and purple gates.\n\nAt this time, the heart’s cultivation is complete,\nNever again to revolve in rebirth.\nThe path lies clear and bright,\nYet worldly beings remain deluded.\n\nRoaming beyond the celestial realms,\nOne may yet attend the Primordial Sovereign.\"\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy wished to journey among the heavens, expounding the *Boundless Wondrous Dharma Lotus Sutra* to the celestial hosts. Within the assembly, a Perfected One named Flowing Rosy Clouds ascended and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: \"Since ancient times, I have attained the Dao, yet never heard this scripture. Now, as the Primordial Sovereign expounds this wondrous scripture, my heart rejoices, pondering it day and night. Yet many beings endure suffering, never hearing the wondrous scripture—what is this wondrous Dharma? I shall inform the celestial hosts, together exhorting the good men and women of the world to transmit and transform, even a single scroll, seven scrolls, or a thousand myriad scrolls. Their merit shall be boundless, their virtue immeasurable.\"\n\nI shall disseminate it widely, ensuring it is never lost or forgotten. Though plants and forests, great seas and mountains may wither and dry, this merit knows no bounds, no cessation, enduring through kalpas ever-renewed. To deliver sentient beings, they shall not descend into darkness.\"\n\nThen the Heavenly Worthy rejoiced: \"Excellent, excellent! For a thousand myriad eons henceforth, afflictions shall be no more.\" At that moment, the assembled celestial immortals each bowed in gratitude to the Most High, exultant and reverent, praising with folded hands before withdrawing. Each to their own place, they received the teaching and put it into practice.\n\n*The Fifth Scroll of the Most High Central Dao Wondrous Dharma Lotus Sutra* concludes.\n\n*The Sixth Scroll of the Most High Central Dao Wondrous Dharma Lotus Sutra*\n**Chapter Ten: Retribution and Response**\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy declared: \"In ancient times, immortals descended to the world below, while demonic spirits and ghosts filled the heavens and earth, devouring people and amassing filth, polluting mountains and rivers. The immortals in their cultivation were all afflicted, the stench of blood and flesh overwhelming. They beseeched the heavens: 'Hundreds and thousands of holy beings, long cultivating the Ten Virtues, all possess divine powers. Let them cut down the demonic hordes of the world, sparing people from being devoured.'\"\n\nThen, within the assembly, a Perfected One named Great Unity bowed and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: \"Now is the time. I have long held this intention but never before presented it to the Heavenly Worthy. I beseech you to bestow the unimpeded sword for slaying evil, the water of non-action, and the incantation to sever demonic spirits.\"\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy recited the incantation:\n*\"I wield the unimpeded incantation,\nAll ghosts shall be ground to dust.\nBanished far beyond other realms,\nEach shall have their skulls shattered,\nLike sand and stone crushed to powder.\nDo not harass the immortal disciples,\nDo not devour sentient beings.\nHearing but a single word of my incantation,\nFlee swiftly to distant lands.\nBeyond the seas, no refuge remains,\nSave only the hells.\nForever bound as karmic ghosts,\nNever to hear the wondrous sutra.\nThe Sovereign commands the ghosts:\nDo not afflict sentient beings.\nShould you defy my teaching,\nYour heads shall shatter into a thousand pieces,\nForever barred from hearing the wondrous sutra.\"*\n\nAt that moment, the ghosts all manifested their forms, gazing reverently upon the Perfected One: \"We beg for your compassion, heed our words. As ghosts, our origins were not of our own making. In ancient times, some were once human, yet lacked faith, disdaining the Three Treasures, indulging in greed and desire. Constantly committing evil, delighting in killing, consuming flesh and blood, scorning the Ten Virtues; uttering harsh words, sowing discord, slandering the sages and Perfected, insulting sacred images, stealing offerings. First tasting myriad flavors, they fell into the ghostly realm, passing through a thousand kalpas without the chance to cycle back into human form. Now, encountering the Perfected One and receiving the Sovereign’s decree, we observe all ghosts and spirits, forsaking the karma of uninterrupted suffering. We beseech the Perfected One, for our sake, to expound this *Wondrous Dharma Lotus Sutra*, that we may follow in cultivating the Dao and ascend together as Perfected Immortals. We pray the Perfected One will present this to the Primordial Sovereign.\"\n\n**Chapter Twelve: Transforming Ghosts into the Human Realm**\n\nThen, the Primordial Sovereign commanded the ghost kings: \"I have heard of your deeds—constantly defiling immortal altars in the human realm, consuming foul and putrid offerings. I have ordered the Perfected One to sever and banish you to distant lands. Now, let all ghosts abandon evil and return to rectitude, following me in cultivating the Dao. Those who awaken to the Perfected shall behold the ranks of the sages, mastering unimpeded wisdom. They shall deliver the deluded masses, subdue evil demons, and with their divine powers encircle the world, guarding the sacred altars and temples in mountains, forests, wilds, valleys, and secluded ravines, protecting all immortal disciples who cultivate the Dao. You, ghost kings, having received my decree, shall return to the path of immortals, seeking and studying eternal life.\"\n\nThen, the Primordial Sovereign praised in verse:\n*\"Demons return to the true Dao,\nSubduing all evil ghosts.\nThough they attain the joy of eternal life,\nThey roam freely, naturally at ease.\nAiding the Dao through a thousand myriad kalpas,\nEver dwelling as immortals upon the seas,\nAt night they attend the Huaqing Palace,\nAt dawn they wander the peaks of the Five Marchmounts.\nDispelling evil beyond the Eastern Sea,\nGathering mists to purify the world.\nHolding fire to illuminate the void,\nMoving mountains with but a small effort,\nExhaling to fill deep valleys,\nObscuring the moon to reach Penglai Palace.\"*\n\nThereupon, the ghost kings bowed deeply, kneeling to address the Heavenly Worthy: \"Since becoming ghosts, we have governed the world’s evil spirits, preventing them from harming the people and protecting all children. The celestial hosts have preached the *Wondrous Dharma Lotus Sutra* to us. For those who cultivate the Dao and refine their true nature, we shall aid their teachings. If any people in the world contract illness, we shall guard and protect them. When immortals and Daoist masters transmit this wondrous sutra, the sick shall surely recover and find peace, demons and ghosts dare not approach, evil spirits shall flee afar, miasmic vapors shall withdraw their menace, and poisonous substances shall disperse. We shall constantly assist in practicing these scriptures and incantations, sparing people from all suffering, ensuring their safety, that all may awaken to the immortals’ path, study the great Dao, and attain profound enlightenment.\" They bowed in reverence and withdrew.\n\n*The Sixth Scroll of the Most High Central Dao Wondrous Dharma Lotus Sutra* concludes.\n\n*The Seventh Scroll of the Most High Central Dao Wondrous Dharma Lotus Sutra*\n**Chapter Thirteen: Attaining the Dao and Returning to the True**\n\nAt that time, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning emitted beams of five-colored radiance from his brows, illuminating the boundless beings of the lower worlds—the boundless spirits and ghosts, boundless demons and malevolent forces, boundless good fruits, boundless evils, boundless wrongdoings, boundless sufferings, boundless stinginess and greed, boundless jealousy, boundless lewdness, boundless deceit, boundless harsh speech, boundless divisive words, boundless scheming and harm. All manner of afflictions and diseases clashed in endless enmity, evoking profound pity.\n\nNow, through the manifold transformations of the Dao, and by means of the *Most High Upper Grade Wondrous Dharma Lotus Sutra*, I shall cause all demon kings and ghost lords to cast aside their venomous wickedness, utterly abandon their perverse minds, follow me in studying the Dao, return to truth and enter sagehood—I shall gather and transform them.\n\nThen, the Celestial Venerable descended from the Azure Heaven of Primordial Beginning, accompanied by hosts of perfected immortals and celestial transcendents, all assembling to hear the exposition of the *Wondrous Dharma Lotus Sutra*. At that moment, the ghost kings all forsook their demonic origins, returned to truth, and studied the Dao, joining in unison to offer praise.\n\nThe ghosts then recited a verse:\nWith glaring eyes we dried the seas,\nNow we are true and upright ones;\nOnce able to move mountains and uproot trees,\nNow we are mighty transcendents of great strength.\nOnce wielding storm winds and lightning’s glare,\nNow we are immortals of flowing rosy clouds;\nOnce severing evil and expelling demonic harm,\nNow we are radiant transcendents of purple splendor.\nOnce aiding the weak and warding off distress,\nNow we are Asīti transcendents.\n\nNow we receive the decree of the Primordial Lord:\nAll immortals inscribe our names in the immortal register;\nNow we receive the decree of the Primordial Lord:\nOur feathered chariots ascend to pay homage to the host of transcendents;\nNow we receive the decree of the Primordial Lord:\nWe soar through the skies and scatter the clouds;\nNow we receive the decree of the Primordial Lord:\nWe manifest the wondrous chapters of the Dao;\nNow we receive the decree of the Primordial Lord:\nWe attain the purple script and the primordial discourse.\nNow we receive the decree of the Primordial Lord:\nWe illuminate the multitudes like the sun and moon;\nNow we receive the decree of the Primordial Lord:\nWe assist below to prosper the king’s reign;\nNow we receive the decree of the Primordial Lord:\nWe dwell on sacred mountains to tend the ritual altars;\nNow we receive the decree of the Primordial Lord:\nOur immortal chariots accompany us in mountain abodes;\nNow we receive the decree of the Primordial Lord:\nWe perform rites to deliver the common folk.\nNow we receive the decree of the Primordial Lord:\nWe banish demons from the earthly realm;\nNow we receive the decree of the Primordial Lord:\nAll transcendents gather with the host of immortals;\nNow we receive the decree of the Primordial Lord:\nWe guard the ritual texts at the apricot altars;\nNot falling under myriad decrees,\nWe eternally secure the source of immortality.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: The Dao Without Attachment**\n\nAt that time, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning addressed the great assembly: \"From ancient times, I have been without desire, without entanglement, and thus attained sagehood. Now, all you immortals who study the Dao and cultivate transcendence, seek only freedom and ease, dispelling the five desires. Dwelling in mountains or open spaces, you discuss together the five thousand characters of the wondrous Dao, delivering the common folk from grave illness, peril, and suffering. Yet they are harmed by those who bury their names and inscribe curses upon the sacred altars of temples and shrines, bringing distress and hardship. Simply invite Daoist masters to sincerely recite this wondrous sutra in their homes—one scroll, two scrolls, or even all seven—and naturally, curses shall dissipate, all illnesses be cured, misfortunes averted, and legal disputes kept afar.\n\nIf devout men and women offer incense, flowers, lamps, and candles, arrange the earth-wheel diagram, and scatter precious treasures, all the celestial transcendents shall come to protect and guard them. Declare your utmost goodness, and do not generate contempt, slander, or disdain; cultivate reverence and faith. Whether keeping lamps lit day and night or making offerings all day long, from the beginningless past until now, I have never heard of this sutra called the *Wondrous Dharma Lotus Sutra*, nor has anyone been able to uphold it. If one recites and transmits this sutra, the sick shall recover, and all demonic misfortunes be dispelled. Let all Daoist masters widely propagate it to deliver the people.\n\nIf one slanders or reviles it, they shall lose their true nature for generations, falling into poverty and lowliness, enduring suffering in solitude, constantly afflicted by grave illness. Demonic forces shall assail them, calamity shall extend to nine generations of ancestors, and misfortune shall reach their present kin.\"\n\nAt that time, all the celestial immortals, sages, and spirits, having heard this wondrous Dharma, rejoiced greatly, leapt with joy, bowed in reverence, and faithfully received and practiced it. All the true immortals of the Dao bowed to the Celestial Venerable and withdrew with gratitude.\n\n*The Seventh Scroll of the Most High Central Dao Wondrous Dharma Lotus Sutra* concludes.\n\n*The Eighth Scroll of the Most High Central Dao Wondrous Dharma Lotus Sutra*\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: The Forms of Heaven and Earth**\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Celestial Venerable was in the Seven Jeweled Grove of the Great Brahma Heaven, convening with all the celestial immortals, great sages, and perfected beings, expounding the wondrous Dharma.\n\nThen, the Perfected of Universal Virtue and Wondrous Conduct arose from his seat, adjusted his cap and robes, touched his head to the ground in prostration, and knelt in reverence. Holding his tablet before him, he advanced and addressed the Celestial Venerable:\n\n\"Previously, I received and upheld the verses of the *Dharma Lotus Sutra* as you expounded them, yet I have not fully awakened to their meaning. I now humbly beseech the Celestial Venerable: we perfected beings traverse the ten directions and boundless worlds day and night, teaching and transforming sentient beings. Yet we do not know the height of heaven and the depth of earth, the shallows and depths of rivers and streams, or the movements and measures of the sun, moon, and stars. I pray that the Celestial Venerable, in your compassion, will explain these causes to us perfected beings, that all in this assembly may hear and understand.\"\n\nAt that time, the Celestial Venerable replied: \"You perfected beings, I shall now distinguish and explain these matters for you. Listen carefully and reflect deeply upon them.\n\nThe depth of what you ask is profound: first, there is a layer twenty billion *li* deep; next, a fragrant, moist layer, also twenty billion *li* deep; then, layers of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, giant clamshell, agate, coral, amber, and all manner of wondrous treasures, forty billion *li* deep; next, a layer of golden grain-sand, eighty billion *li* deep; then, a layer of diamond ore, ten billion *li* deep; next, a layer of silver grain-sand, one hundred billion *li* deep; and finally, a layer of silver diamond ore, two hundred billion *li* deep. Beneath all this lies the boundless great wind, which bears the great earth, keeping it from tilting or shaking. Thus are the measures of heaven and earth, and the depths of rivers and streams, all known.\n\nAll things under heaven—mountains and forests, trees and groves, the Yangtze, Huai, and Ji rivers, great seas and small seas, ravines and springs, pools and ditches, gullies and valleys, wells and marshes, streams and fountains, mulberry thickets and forests, all varieties of herbs and grasses, fragrant scents, and the hues of blue, yellow, red, white, and black—all arise and grow from the great earth.\n\nThere are earthen mountains, rocky mountains, inner mountains, the Great Iron Enclosure Mountain, the Lesser Iron Enclosure Mountain, Mount Meru, the Diamond Mountain, and all manner of wondrous jeweled mountains. Among them, the Fire Mountain of the Azure Vault and the Jade Mountain of All Mountains surge forth with the four treasures, towering above all. All these wondrous jeweled mountains are formed from the treasures that well forth from the great earth.\n\nMount Meru is composed of the four treasures, surging upward to surpass all. The mountains and rivers of the world are divided into four directions: the south is lapis lazuli, the west is crystal, the north is agate, and the east is gold. Their radiance illuminates the four quarters of the world, and all together they are called the Four Heavens.\n\nMount Meru is where the Four Heavenly Kings, the Protectors of the World, reside, guarding and stabilizing the four directions.\n\nWhat is Mount Meru? To the south, there are immeasurable seven-jeweled palaces, ten thousand *li* above the earth. Within them dwells the Heavenly King Virūḍhaka, whose body is twenty-five *li* tall, with a lifespan of eighty-seven thousand years. His clothing and food arise naturally. There are also men and women within, each twenty-five *li* tall, whose clothing and food likewise arise naturally. All beings in Jambudvīpa who receive the Three Refuges and Nine Precepts, honor their parents, serve their teachers, and worship the Three Venerables without transgression may be reborn there.\n\nTo the west of Mount Meru, there are immeasurable seven-jeweled palaces, one million *li* above the earth. Within them dwells the Heavenly King Virūpākṣa, whose body is twenty-five *li* tall, with a lifespan of eighty-seven thousand years. His clothing and food arise naturally. All beings in Jambudvīpa who receive the Three Refuges and Five Precepts, honor their parents, serve their teachers, and worship the Three Venerables without transgression may be reborn there.\n\nTo the north of Mount Meru, there are also immeasurable seven-jeweled palaces, one million *li* above the earth. Within them dwells the Heavenly King Vaiśravaṇa, whose body is twenty-five *li* tall, with a lifespan of eighty-seven thousand years. His clothing and food arise naturally. There are also men and women within, each twenty-five *li* tall, whose clothing and food likewise arise naturally. All beings in Jambudvīpa who receive the Three Refuges and Five Precepts, honor their parents, serve their teachers, and worship the Three Venerables without transgression may be reborn there.\n\nTo the east of Mount Meru, there are also immeasurable seven-jeweled palaces, one million *li* above the earth. Within them dwells the Heavenly King Dhṛtarāṣṭra, whose body is twenty-five *li* tall. The lifespans, body sizes, clothing, and food of all the men and women there are the same. All beings in Jambudvīpa who cultivate good conduct, uphold the Three Refuges and Five Precepts, honor their parents, serve their teachers, and worship the Three Venerables without transgression may be reborn there.\n\nThe abode of the Wheel-Turning Sage King is also adorned with immeasurable seven-jeweled palaces, two million *li* above the earth. At that time, the Wheel-Turning Sage King, all his ministers, and his retinue are each twenty-three *li* tall, with lifespans of two hundred fifty thousand years. Their clothing and food arise naturally. The Wheel-Turning Sage King and his princes all ride upon great seven-jeweled conveyances, traveling through the four continents to teach and transform all beings. Those who uphold the Three Refuges and Five Precepts, cultivate the Ten Good Deeds, refrain from all evil, receive, uphold, recite, and study the *Wondrous Dharma Lotus Sutra*, and follow their heart’s desires may be reborn there. There are also immeasurable seven-jeweled palaces where men and women are twenty-five *li* tall, with lifespans of two hundred fifty thousand years. Their clothing and food arise naturally, and they lack nothing.\n\nAbove Mount Meru is the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, the foremost of the heavens, where lifespans are immeasurable.\"\n\nIn that heaven, the celestial beings stand twenty-five *li* tall. All experience boundless joy, and their clothing and food arise naturally. Among the multitude of beings in Jambudvīpa, those who uphold the Three Refuges and Five Precepts, cultivate the Ten Good Deeds, diligently practice with purity, make offerings to the immortals, receive, uphold, recite, and chant the *Wondrous Dharma Lotus Sutra*, and day and night with single-minded devotion protect and maintain the sutra and precepts—fully pure and without transgression—will, at the end of their lifespans, be reborn there according to their wishes.\n\nThe second heaven has a lifespan of two kalpas, and clothing and food arise naturally. There, too, are men and women twenty-five *li* tall. Those who uphold the Five Precepts and Ten Good Deeds may be reborn there.\n\nThe third heaven has a lifespan of four kalpas, and clothing and food arise naturally. There, too, are men and women twenty-five *li* tall. Those who uphold the Five Precepts and Ten Good Deeds may be reborn there.\n\nThe fourth heaven has a lifespan of eight kalpas, and clothing and food arise naturally. There, too, are men and women twenty-five *li* tall. Those who uphold the Five Precepts and Ten Good Deeds may be reborn there.\n\nThe fifth heaven has a lifespan of sixteen kalpas, and clothing and food arise naturally. There, too, are men and women twenty *li* tall. Those who uphold the Five Precepts and Ten Good Deeds may be reborn there.\n\nThe sixth heaven has a lifespan of thirty kalpas, and clothing and food arise naturally. There, too, are men and women twenty *li* tall. Those who uphold the Five Precepts and Ten Good Deeds may be reborn there.\n\nThe seventh heaven has a lifespan of sixty-four kalpas, and clothing and food arise naturally. There, too, are men and women twenty *li* tall. Those who uphold the Five Precepts and Ten Good Deeds may be reborn there.\n\nThe eighth heaven has a lifespan of one hundred twenty-eight kalpas, and clothing and food arise naturally. There, too, are men and women twenty *li* tall. Those who uphold the Five Precepts and Ten Good Deeds may be reborn there.\n\nThe ninth heaven has a lifespan of two hundred fifty-six kalpas, and clothing and food arise naturally. There, too, are men and women twenty *li* tall. Those who uphold the Five Precepts and Ten Good Deeds may be reborn there.\n\nThe tenth heaven has a lifespan of five hundred twelve kalpas, and clothing and food arise naturally. There, too, are men and women twenty *li* tall. Those who uphold the Five Precepts and Ten Good Deeds may be reborn there.\n\nThe eleventh heaven has a lifespan of one thousand twenty-four kalpas, and clothing and food arise naturally. There, too, are men and women twenty *li* tall. Those who uphold the Five Precepts and Ten Good Deeds may be reborn there.\n\nThe twelfth heaven has a lifespan of two thousand forty-eight kalpas, and clothing and food arise naturally. There, too, are men and women twenty *li* tall. Those who uphold the Five Precepts and Ten Good Deeds may be reborn there.\n\nThe thirteenth heaven has a lifespan of four thousand ninety-six kalpas, and clothing and food arise naturally. There, too, are men and women twenty *li* tall. Those who uphold the Five Precepts and Ten Good Deeds may be reborn there.\n\nThe fourteenth heaven has a lifespan of eight thousand one hundred ninety-two kalpas, and clothing and food arise naturally. There, too, are men and women twenty *li* tall. Those who uphold the Five Precepts and Ten Good Deeds may be reborn there.\n\nThe fifteenth heaven has a lifespan of ten thousand kalpas, and clothing and food arise naturally. There, too, are men and women twenty *li* tall. Those who uphold the Five Precepts and Ten Good Deeds may be reborn there.\n\nThe sixteenth heaven has a lifespan of twenty thousand kalpas, and clothing and food arise naturally. There, too, are men and women twenty *li* tall. Those who uphold the Five Precepts and Ten Good Deeds may be reborn there.\n\nThe seventeenth heaven has a lifespan of forty thousand kalpas, and clothing and food arise naturally. There, too, are men and women twenty *li* tall. Those who uphold the Five Precepts and Ten Good Deeds may be reborn there.\n\nThe eighteenth heaven has a lifespan of eighty thousand kalpas, and clothing and food arise naturally. There, too, are men and women twenty *li* tall. Those who uphold the Five Precepts and Ten Good Deeds may be reborn there.\n\nThe nineteenth heaven has a lifespan of one hundred sixty thousand kalpas, and clothing and food arise naturally. There, too, are men and women twenty *li* tall. Those who uphold the Five Precepts and Ten Good Deeds may be reborn there.\n\nThe twentieth heaven has a lifespan of three hundred twenty thousand kalpas, and clothing and food arise naturally. There, too, are men and women twenty *li* tall. Those who uphold the Five Precepts and Ten Good Deeds may be reborn there.\n\nIn the central heaven, the celestial beings possess spiritual penetrations and freedom, their bodies and minds are pure, and they are without obstruction, equal to the perfected ones.\n\nFrom the twenty-first heaven to the thirty-second heaven at the summit, there is no distinction among them; only the celestial venerables and perfected ones dwell there, beyond all conception.\n\nMoreover, the distance between heaven and earth is one hundred million *yojanas*. The sun and moon are eighty million *li* from the earth. Mount Meru is three million six hundred thousand *li* in height, depth, and breadth. Jambudvīpa is three million three hundred thousand *li* in length and breadth. Godāniya to the west is four million one hundred eighty thousand *li* in breadth; Uttarakuru to the north is six million six hundred forty thousand *li* in breadth; Pūrvavideha to the east is five million three hundred twenty thousand *li* in breadth. The Vajra Mountains and the Great Iron-Encompassing Mountains are each two million *li* in height, while the Lesser Iron-Encompassing Mountains are one million two hundred thousand *li* in height. The great ocean is five thousand *li* in breadth and three thousand *li* in depth; the lesser ocean is one thousand five hundred *li* in breadth and one thousand *li* in depth. The great rivers are eighty *li* in breadth and forty *li* in depth; the lesser rivers are forty *li* in breadth and twenty *li* in depth. The ford is three *li* in breadth and one and a half *li* in depth. Moreover, the sun and moon each have a circumference of one thousand seven hundred *li*; the great stars have a circumference of one hundred twenty *li*; the lesser stars have a circumference of eighty *li*; and the wheels of fire and water each have a circumference of one thousand seven hundred *li*.\n\nThe four seasons of the world are such that winter is extremely cold, summer extremely hot, while spring and autumn are temperate. Why is this so? The sun travels along three paths: in winter, it follows the northern path; in summer, the southern path; and in spring and autumn, the central path. Gold and crystal form the sun; silver and lapis lazuli form the moon; and all the stars are made of silver. Each resides according to its size, all enjoying bliss, free and unbound.\n\nAs for the sun being composed of gold and mercury: in summer, the crystal recedes entirely, and the gold appears fully, aided by the wheel of fire. Mount Sumeru possesses a hundred million vajras, all of which contribute to the heat. Since the sun travels along the southern path above the Fire Mountain, the entire world becomes intensely hot. In winter, the wheel of fire departs, the gold recedes entirely, and the crystal appears fully, aided by the wheel of water. As the sun travels along the northern path above the Water Mountain, the entire world becomes extremely cold.\n\nThe moon, residing in the heavens, illuminates the world with a single radiance, yet within a month, it waxes and wanes. Why is this so? The moon is composed of silver and lapis lazuli. When the lapis lazuli is concealed and the silver appears, the world is bright. After fifteen days, it gradually turns, and by the thirtieth day, the silver is concealed and the lapis lazuli appears, so the world grows dark.\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy addressed the Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct, saying: \"All beings in the four directions of the world differ from one another. Listen well, for I shall explain this to you.\n\nAll beings in the western continent of Jambudvīpa are ten *li* in height and live for a thousand years, enjoying boundless, self-mastered bliss. They are not born from the wombs of parents but are all transformed from lotus flowers. Clothing and food appear naturally upon their bodies, growing with them. When they eat, great treasure bowls—made of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, giant clamshell, agate, coral, and amber—appear of their own accord according to the season. Heavenly kitchens fill these bowls with a hundred flavors, fragrant and delicious. Eating them, one’s qi and strength are harmonized, the body becomes upright and majestic, wisdom and intelligence are keen, talents and understanding are brilliant, and the spiritual powers and virtues are inconceivable.\n\nAll beings in the northern continent of Uttarakuru are twenty *li* in height and live for a thousand years. Though there are men and women, there is no licentiousness. Males are born from their fathers’ sides, and females are transformed from their mothers’ sides. Clothing and food appear naturally, their qi is abundant, their bodies are at peace, and they suffer no illness—this too is inconceivable.\n\nAll beings in the eastern continent of Pūrvavideha are nine *li* in height and live for five hundred years. Though they till the soil, there are no royal taxes, nor do they suffer from thieves, fire, water, illness, or poverty. Why is this? In the southern continent of Jambudvīpa, all beings have short, fragile bodies and brief lifespans, enduring much sorrow, affliction, and hardship. The longest-lived reach a hundred years, while the short-lived perish in the womb or die young. Even after being born, they constantly suffer from cold and hunger. Since they rely on their parents for upbringing and depend on their own strength, they toil to provide for themselves. Their natures are stingy and greedy, they lack self-awareness, disdain the sacred teachings, and betray the sages—thus they receive such karmic retribution.\n\nThe beings of Jambudvīpa, Uttarakuru, and Pūrvavideha enjoy bodily bliss and extended lifespans because they diligently cultivate progress, make offerings to their teachers, uphold the scriptures with purity, and perfect their merit and conduct—thus they receive such karmic retribution and are born among them. Even in the southern continent of Jambudvīpa, those who cultivate good deeds, leave the household life, protect the precepts and scriptures, and perfect purity may, according to their wishes, also be born among them.\"\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy restated this meaning and spoke in verse:\n\n\"Listen well, all of you,\nI shall now make this clear,\nSo that all this great assembly\nMay hear without doubt.\nI expound this wondrous Dao,\nListen without confusion:\n\nThe great earth is vast and deep,\nTwo hundred ten thousand *li*;\nNext lies a fragrant, moist layer,\nTwenty thousand *li* deep;\nThen a layer of various treasures—\nGold, silver, and glass,\nGiant clamshell, agate,\nCarnelian, lapis lazuli, and pearls—\nAll these precious treasures\nExtend four billion *li*.\n\nAll the great seas,\nBoth great and small,\nRivers, streams, and valleys,\nMedicinal herbs and forests,\nEverything in the world\nArises from the earth.\n\nBlack mountains, earthen mountains,\nAnd all the Meru Mountains,\nIron mountains, the Great Iron-Encompassing,\nVajra and Sumeru—\nAll emerge from this great earth,\nBringing forth treasures.\n\nOnly Mount Sumeru,\nKing of all mountains,\nIs formed of four treasures,\nTowering above the world.\nWhat are these four called?\nThe southern is lapis lazuli,\nThe western is glass,\nThe northern is agate,\nThe eastern is gold—\nThus it is called the Four Treasures.\n\nThe Four Heavenly Kings who guard the world\nDwell there accordingly.\nKings and all men and women\nAre twenty-five *li* in height,\nLive eighty-seven thousand years,\nAnd their clothing and food appear naturally.\n\nThe palaces of the Wheel-Turning King\nAre two hundred *li* above the earth.\nHis lifespan and body,\nAnd all treasures, are no different.\n\nAt that time, the Wheel-Turning King\nRides the great heavenly treasure chariot,\nTraveling through the four continents,\nTeaching and transforming all beings.\nThose who cultivate good deeds\nWill surely be born there,\nTheir clothing, food, and lifespan\nAll equal, without difference.\n\nAll the heavenly sages and worthies\nDwell atop Mount Sumeru.\nThe heavenly beings there\nNaturally enjoy bliss,\nLiving for billions of kalpas,\nTheir clothing and food appearing naturally.\n\nIn Jambudvīpa, those who\nDiligently uphold the precepts,\nMake offerings to the heavenly perfected,\nWill surely be born there.\"\n\nFrom the Heaven of No-Heaven above to the Four Eights Heavens,\nTheir lifespans in kalpas increase in cycles like a turning wheel.\nAll the heavenly beings there\nShare the same clothing and food,\nPossessing spiritual powers and freedom,\nWithout any obstacles.\n\nThose who can uphold and follow their heart’s wishes,\nAmong all the heavenly beings,\nWill dwell therein,\nTheir lifespans in kalpas\nBeyond all thought and measure.\n\nHeaven and earth are separated by\nA hundred million *yojanas*.\nThe sun and moon are\nEighty-one myriad *li* from the earth.\nThe stars are\nSeventy billion myriad *li* from the earth.\n\nNext is Mount Sumeru,\nTogether with Jambudvīpa,\nEach three hundred and thirty-six myriad *li*\nIn length and breadth.\nThe western continent, Godāniya, spans\nFour million one hundred eighty myriad *li*.\nThe northern continent, Uttarakuru,\nIs six hundred myriad *li*\nIn length and breadth,\nSixty-four million myriad *li* in total,\nPure and without blemish.\n\nThe great iron encircling mountains of Vajra\nAre each two million *li* high.\nThe lesser iron mountains are\nOne million two hundred thousand *li* high.\n\nThe great ocean is five thousand *li* wide\nAnd three thousand *li* deep.\nThe lesser seas are one thousand five hundred *li* wide,\nTheir waters a thousand *li* deep.\nThe great rivers are eighty *li* wide,\nTheir waters forty *li* deep.\nThe lesser rivers are forty *li* wide,\nTwenty *li* deep.\nThe fords are three *li* wide,\nOne and a half *li* deep.\n\nThe sun and moon are both perfectly round,\nOne thousand seven hundred *li* in circumference.\nThe great stars are one hundred twenty *li* in circumference,\nThe medium stars eighty *li*.\nAll the lesser stars\nAre forty-five *li* in circumference.\n\nThe Perfected of Wondrous Conduct know\nThat the world has four seasons.\nThe sun travels along three paths,\nRevolving within the heavens:\nIn winter, it travels the northern path,\nThus the world grows cold.\nIn summer, it travels the southern path,\nThus the world grows hot.\nIn spring and autumn, it travels the central path,\nAnd the world is perfectly harmonious.\n\nThe sun is of golden water-crystal,\nThe moon of silver beryl.\nAll the heavenly stars\nAre made of silver.\n\nThe Three Treasures Wheel of Water and Fire\nIs one thousand seven hundred *li* in circumference.\nThe beings of Jambudvīpa\nExperience heat and cold for a hundred years.\nIn Uttarakuru and Godāniya,\nLifespans exceed a thousand years.\nIn the land of Pūrvavideha,\nThey reach five hundred years.\nThus the lifespans of all beings\nDiffer from one another.\n\nThose who uphold the fasts and precepts\nAre no different from the Perfected.\nI now proclaim this hymn—\nYou should faithfully receive and uphold it.\n\n*The Wondrous Dharma Lotus Sutra of the Middle Way of the Most High, Scroll Eight, concludes.*\n\n---\n\n*The Wondrous Dharma Lotus Sutra of the Middle Way of the Most High, Scroll Nine*\n*Chapter Sixteen: The Exhortation to Attain True Emptiness*\n\nAt that time, the Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning convened all the immortals and heavenly hosts in the Forest of Seven Treasures to expound the wondrous Dharma. Then the Perfected of Salvation from Suffering came forward, bowed his head, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: \"This disciple’s nature is dull and ignorant. By good fortune, I have been able to attend upon the immortals and hear the wondrous principles, which have opened my benighted mind. I venture to ask: Why are the sufferings and joys of the beings in Jambudvīpa unequal? Why do they experience such disparities in wealth and poverty, nobility and lowliness, long life and early death? I humbly beseech the Heavenly Compassion to especially grant enlightenment.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"Excellent, excellent! The Perfected One is able to inquire wisely. I shall now expound this for you. The places where beings are born—whether in toil or ease—are the retributions of their karmic deeds. Some perform good deeds, while others do not. Some dwell in the domains of wealth, nobility, longevity, and blessings, while others dwell in poverty and lowliness. The causes of good and evil are distant, whether fragrant or foul, and cannot be equal. It is like the sun and moon, whose light shines impartially, or like all the immortals and heavenly hosts, who universally know all things through the radiance of their wisdom. Beings are born within the Six Paths. If they believe in and understand the scriptures, hear the true Dharma, and transform into immortals and heavenly beings, their wisdom will neither increase nor diminish. If their merit is abundant, they will behold the Three Supreme Worthies. What difference is there in the natures of these beings? It is like vessels made from the same clay: some hold treasures, while others hold filth. Each is used according to the preferences of its recipient, with various differences in their arrangements. This is the One Vehicle, or the Two Vehicles, and then the Three Vehicles. If there are beings who can uphold the Three Vehicles, take refuge in the true Dao, and believe in and understand its various aspects, they will attain the way of liberation through the corpse, and next become great immortals. Therefore, I now reiterate this exhortation. Why do the preferences of beings differ so greatly? Some beings see the sun, moon, and stars, while others do not—what is the principle behind this? It corresponds to the places where beings dwell in the world, born and raised without recognizing the true and correct. If they first committed evil deeds, now their illnesses arise, and there are four kinds: wind, jaundice, phlegm, and *yan*. These reverse and become calamities in due time, leading to early death. Out of compassion for beings, I now arise with expedient means to proclaim this sutra. If there are beings who can receive and uphold it with courage and diligence, without retrogression, this is the good medicine that cures all illnesses. Within it, they will fathom its meaning, gradually ascend to the true path, like removing obstacles, and perceive clearly both within and without, near and far. When I first received the transmission, I attained such awakening to the mysterious, and only then did I gain the eye to see clearly. I first comprehended the wondrous Dharma, recognized the Dharma of non-emptiness, and thus made myself unsurpassable.\"\n\nThe meaning of \"I\" does not compare to the six penetrations—clairvoyant sight, clairaudient hearing, knowledge of others' minds, recollection of past lives, or the perfection of wisdom. Now I can fathom the profound and wondrous, employing the Dao to succor all things, sheltering even the tiniest crawling creatures and faintest glimmers. Yet I observe that beings utterly lack understanding: they take darkness for light and light for darkness, indulging in indolence and arrogance, their minds devoid of wisdom. Good is scarce while evil abounds, just as within this assembly—how can they be called discerning? Far-off forms they cannot see, nearby sounds they cannot hear. Whether beings' minds incline toward good or evil, their conduct stands at the threshold of the Way, yet they walk without arriving; though it is manifestly clear, they gaze without perceiving.\n\nBy what expedient means can I save and deliver them? If beings wish to awaken, they must cast aside sensory pleasures, relinquish their attachments, sit in secluded mountains, contemplate the subtle, and sever the nets of doubt—only then will they attain spiritual penetrations. Shielded and protected, they may leave the household life, don the robe, and pay homage to the Three Treasures. Within this Dao, they should reflect on prior conduct. Through this cause, all merits may be realized; as they contemplate, the profound principles of the supreme vehicle will be fully grasped. Reaching the pivot of the Dao, they will join the ranks of the immortals.\n\nYet there are beings of little wisdom and scant discernment, like those born blind, who cannot perceive good fruits. They only commit evil deeds, unaware of the ultimate intent, deluded by afflictions, their conduct rarely accumulating merit. Through karmic conditions, they forfeit longevity, goodness, wealth, and nobility, and instead receive premature death, misfortune, poverty, and lowliness. Such beings abide in the midst of cyclic existence, never escaping the cage, scarcely transcending the wondrous Dao.\n\nUpon hearing these words, the Perfected One Who Saves from Suffering felt deep compassion, fearing that beings would forever sink into evil destinies. He again addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: \"I now vow to deliver them, to free them from the wheel of rebirth.\"\n\nThen the Heavenly Worthy, leaning on his armrest, declared: \"Excellent, excellent! You now harbor such a vow. Like parents cherishing their infant child, you bestow nurture, enact deliverance, and rescue beings. This scripture is named the *Dharma Blossom*, pervading empty space, universally aiding immortals and guides, leading the deluded to escape the three realms and behold the supreme immortals.\n\nSome beings, due to past lives where good was scarce and evil abundant, fail to distinguish purity and truth, drowning instead in greed, anger, and desire. Thus they suffer from wind, jaundice, phlegm, and *yan*, or sudden cold and violent afflictions. With this scripture, you may treat them according to their conditions, and they will gradually recover, attaining liberation and aligning with the ultimate truth. Light will become constant and clear, while ignorance will vanish. Abiding in goodness, they will gain the eye to perceive vibrant colors, attain the mysterious origin, cast off the six dusts, forever extinguish the three evil destinies, escape the three realms, and no longer drown in the wheel of rebirth. Within the three vehicles, they will grasp the profound principle, their bodies radiating light, fulfilling their desires at will—this is called the wondrous Dao.\"\n\nThen the Heavenly Worthy reiterated this meaning and composed a verse:\n\nThe two lights of sun and moon shine,\nEqually illuminating without bounds,\nLike a single comet,\nIts radiance like sun and moon.\n\nSaliva fills vessels for use,\nEach holding what it may—\nPrecious treasures or filth,\nLight or heavy, all differ.\n\nGood and evil follow what is possessed,\nRetribution metes out suffering or joy.\nIf one clings to various dharmas,\nThis is called \"sitting in delusion.\"\n\nLike one born blind,\nWho sees neither sun, moon, nor stars,\nYet claims there are no colors—\nSuch is their speech.\n\nOnce given the right medicine,\nAfflictions dissipate, and colors and flavors are known.\nThese four kinds,\nCombined, effect the cure.\n\nThus the born-blind,\nDay by day, gain light,\nYet lacking wisdom, they tread the path of suffering—\nSuch is the folly of the world.\n\nOnly the supreme Perfected One knows all this,\nThose who follow the Dao’s master\nHave already escaped the three realms.\n\nThe Perfected One, with compassionate heart,\nPities those who possess such wisdom,\nYet rummage through storehouses,\nWhere sounds and sights remain distant.\n\nThus they dwell apart,\nOthers as you are—\nWhether good or evil in mind,\nYou cannot know them.\n\nIf you wish to approach the numinous,\nYet do not take a step, you cannot go.\nWhen you contemplate them,\nYou will attain spiritual penetrations.\n\nIf you deem seclusion empty,\nContemplate the subtle and purify your resolve,\nEntering stillness,\nThe Perfected One will deliver the world.\n\nPractice the six perfections with purity,\nStillness is without destination.\nCultivate all virtues,\nFor all mountains are not separate.\n\nEach dharma is still and empty,\nAll four kinds of conduct—\nTeaching and transforming beings,\nEven gods and humans praise them.\n\nAll dharmas are equal,\nAll paths of birth possess wisdom.\nEquality is inherent,\nThe Dao’s dharma flows from heaven.\n\n*Tai Shang Zhong Dao Miao Fa Lian Hua Jing*, Scroll Nine, concludes.\n*Tai Shang Zhong Dao Miao Fa Lian Hua Jing*, Scroll Ten.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: The Comprehensive Investigation of Auspicious and Inauspicious Omens**\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Original Beginning was in the Jeweled Grove, expounding the various great and wondrous dharmas. Present were the Perfected of the Great Ultimate, the Perfected of the Great Mystery, the Perfected of Universal Dharma, the Perfected of the Great One, the Perfected of Radiant Stillness, the Perfected of Wondrous Light, the Perfected of Jeweled Accumulation, the Perfected of Universal Virtue, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the Perfected of the Mysterious Unity, the Perfected of Benevolent Life, the Perfected of Salvation from Suffering, the Perfected of Universal Deliverance, the Perfected of Universal Peace, the Perfected of Universal Relief, the Perfected of Self-Mastery, the Perfected of Universal Contemplation, the Perfected of Universal Mind, the Perfected of the Great Void, the Perfected of Great Power, the Heavenly King Dhṛtarāṣṭra of the East, the Heavenly King Virūḍhaka of the South, the Heavenly King Virūpākṣa of the West, the Heavenly King Vaiśravaṇa of the North, the Wheel-Turning Sage King, the Dragon Kings of the Four Seas, the King of Mount Sumeru, the Heavenly Spirit Kings, the Great Spirit King of Wind, the Great Spirit King of Fire, the Great Spirit King of the Supreme, the Great Spirit King of Clouds, the Great Spirit King of Thunder, the Great Spirit King of Lightning, the Great Spirit King of Power, the Great Spirit King of the Moon, the Great Spirit King of Stars, the Lesser Spirit Kings of Stars, the Lesser Spirit King of the Sun, the Lesser Spirit King of the Moon, the Spirit Kings of Flying Devas, the Spirit Kings of Palaces, the Spirit Kings of Temples, the Spirit Kings of Altars and State Sacrifices—each accompanied by their retinues, an immeasurable assembly. They all arrived, bowed their heads in reverence, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying:\n\n“Formerly, we observed the heavens and earth, all worlds, the sun, moon, and constellations, mountains, rivers, cliffs, and caves, gold and jade, earth and stone—all were harmoniously united, vast and luminous, profound and obscure. The times were peaceful, the years abundant, nations secure, and the people prosperous. Beings enjoyed bliss in their rebirths, and suffering and illness did not arise.”\n\nNow we observe the degeneracy of customs and the afflictions of the people—many suffer poverty, premature death, and untimely demise. Fathers and sons, men and women are neither loyal nor filial, neither righteous nor benevolent. They constantly endure famine, and illness and hardship ever befall them. The disparity between past and present remains unperceived, and they dare not awaken to understanding. We humbly beseech the Merciful Worthy to broadly expound and enlighten the deluded and lost.\n\nWithin this worldly net, they hunt and trap birds and beasts, slaughtering living beings. They hoard wealth and goods, unable to bestow charity. They slight and neglect their parents while cherishing their wives and children. Devoid of propriety and righteousness, they are deluded by lust and desire. Their hearts harbor jealousy, and their minds conjure heterodoxies.\n\nThough they may possess the sacred scriptures, they neither reflect upon nor recite them from dawn to dusk, allowing their pages to fray and their scrolls to decay. Never having heard the sagacious titles of the Heavenly Worthy, how can they cultivate good causes? How can blessings and fortune arise?\n\nSuch beings, day and night, are recorded by the True Controllers. Whenever the six fasts, ten auspicious days, three primal festivals, five seasonal rites, or the three assemblies occur, their merits and transgressions are examined, their good and evil tallied, and their faults and errors accumulated. Now they receive their retribution—sin and evil fill their accounts. Moreover, they drown in the sea of suffering, adrift in the river of desire.\n\nNot only do they themselves endure calamity and hardship, but their misfortune extends to the nine generations of descendants and implicates the seven generations of ancestors. The dark bureaus investigate and compare, consigning them to Fengdu, where they suffer for ten thousand kalpas without hope of release.\n\nAt that time, all the Great Perfected Ones, hearing these words, were struck with terror. They entreated the Great Compassion to specially bestow salvation and deliverance.\n\nThen the Heavenly Worthy declared: “I now expound this wondrous scripture to save and deliver all beings. You should listen attentively, transmit its teachings to the world, and circulate it through recitation.\n\nIf mortals of the dusty realm possess good faith, study the Dao, cultivate practice, and uphold the recitation of scriptures, they must first purify their attire and cover their bodies. They must not expose themselves. If their minds generate distractions or their thoughts remain impure, harboring disdain, the winds will blow them straight into the inverted hell, where their sins and suffering will only increase—how could they escape?\n\nIf they can contemplate the Dao and reflect upon the True, even a single utterance or two, it will still dissolve their suffering and misfortune. If they can diligently transcribe the thirty-six sacred scriptures and disseminate them throughout the world, universally exhorting the worthy and common folk of karmic affinity to recite and uphold this scripture, they will obtain boundless blessings.\n\nThose who personally perform good deeds—establishing temples, constructing bridges, distributing grain, cloth, wealth, treasures, and clothing; sacrificing for the benefit of others; aiding orphans and cherishing widows; and upholding the Ten Precepts and the Twenty-Four Precepts—accumulate merit and virtue, praying for future blessings, not merely for the people of this age.\n\nYet such beings recklessly indulge in deceit and falsehood, their hearts set on killing. They incline toward heterodox teachings, indulge in wine and lust, and make no distinction between kin and stranger. They are miserly, jealous, and envious; scheming for profit, they refuse to practice charity. They contend and seize from one another, failing to relieve the poor and destitute. They commit all manner of unlawful acts, amassing evil deeds, and do not uphold the precepts.\n\nThese beings incur heavenly censure, and all manner of malevolent spirits and ghosts pursue them, cutting short their lifespans and casting them into poverty and lowliness, where the five blessings are incomplete.\n\nThen the Heavenly Worthy commanded the Perfected Ones: “Protect and support such people, ensuring their comings and goings are unimpeded, without obstacles or difficulties.”\n\nIf kings, queens, crown princes, ministers, and all the people of the realm delight in the heavens, they will enjoy peace and happiness day and night. If they uphold the precepts with a sincere heart, bathe their five limbs, and recite this *Dharma Flower Sutra*, a hundred illnesses will vanish, and a thousand calamities will disperse.\n\nBut if they grow lax, scoff, slander, speak evil or reckless words, or disbelieve in the scriptures, such people will incur immeasurable karmic retribution and fall into the uninterrupted hell. Those who revere and believe in the scriptures will gain boundless blessings, be reborn among humans or in the heavens, and enjoy all manner of happiness.”\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy further expounded the preceding meaning and spoke this gatha:\n\n“I now proclaim this wondrous gatha,\nAll its words are true and real.\nLet all beings heed and believe,\nFor those who disbelieve the scriptures\nShall fall into the three evil destinies.\nHow could the Perfected Ones of the heavens\nNot return to the Dao?\nNow, seeing the demons subdued,\nThey bow their heads in reverence and come to welcome.\nI proclaim these gatha words,\nThe wondrous Dharma of the true scriptures.\nThose who take refuge, robe themselves in faith,\nShall see their blessings and kindness ever increase.”\n\nThen the Heavenly Worthy instructed the Perfected Ones: “Five hundred years hence, you may descend to the lands of Jambudvīpa and the Middle Kingdom of Zhendan to propagate and transform. At that time, the people of the world will lack goodness, engaging only in killing. Their hair will turn white in their prime, their natures akin to beasts. Men and women will be stunted, their bodies barely over a foot tall. They will not cultivate the five grains but subsist on grass seeds, dwelling entirely beneath the grass.”\n\nOn the ninth day of the ninth month, calamities shall descend from heaven: mountains shall crumble, rocks shall strike, and the four seas shall wither of themselves. All beings shall kill and devour one another. Great transformations shall unfold—grasses and trees, flowers and leaves shall become blades and spears, and any who are struck shall perish. Bones shall pile into mountains, blood shall pool into lakes, reeking and foul, unbearable to approach.\n\nThen the Wind Deity Kings of Heat and Cold, along with all lesser wind deities, shall blow upon the corpses, heaping them into towering mounds. For one year or even ten, the Great Year-Wind King shall scatter these evils like fine dust, leveling them smooth as a palm. Thereafter, vast floods shall rise, eighty feet high, seething like boiling water, impossible to draw near. After five or ten years, the waters shall wash away the filth, the foulness dissolving into mud, the great waters receding to form land, the lesser waters carving streams and valleys. Bubbles upon the waters shall sprout into trees, and through the span of a small thousand-world kalpa, the earth shall harden once more, both above and below, all else likewise restored.\n\nI shall first dispatch the Golden Crested Birds to descend and circle the earth, discerning the good and evil among men and women. Those of profound good roots who uphold this *Lotus Sutra* shall be delivered, spared from these sufferings. But those who neglect precepts and fasts, whose natures are steeped in lust, who kill, steal, hoard, and covet; who speak deceitfully, slander, sow discord, and deceive the foolish; who turn from kin toward strangers, revile sages and immortals, and disrespect the scriptures—such beings, their sins piled high, shall reap boundless suffering. Upon death, they shall fall into the Fengdu Hell of Uninterrupted Torment, enduring agony for ten thousand kalpas, lost in eternal darkness with no hope of escape.\n\nYet if there be faithful men and women—whether Daoist, lay, or Confucian—who chant, sing, and praise the *Cavernous Scriptures*, playing zithers, harps, sheng, xiao, zithers, flutes, drums, and cymbals; who offer incense, flowers, fine fruits, and reverence to the Three Treasures and the assembly of perfected immortals and sages—shall gain immeasurable blessings.\n\nAt that time, in the western continent of Godāniya, there shall be such joy: myriad melodies shall resound day and night in all six watches, and strange beasts, spirit birds, winds, clouds, and trees shall all offer homage, their harmonies refined and solemn. In the northern continent of Uttarakuru, all beings shall contemplate the true Dharma, their clothing and food arising naturally, each delighting as they please. When their lives end, they shall be freed from all suffering. In the eastern continent of Pūrvavideha, beings shall cultivate the true and good Dharma, dwelling in temples and pavilions where music arises of itself.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy again addressed the assembly of Perfected Ones: “I now decree and admonish all spirits and ghosts who follow men: each must reflect inwardly and outwardly. There are the ghosts of the Towering Immortal Loft, the ghosts of those struck by fire, the ghosts of heavenly and earthly deities, the ghosts of mountain and tree spirits, the mighty ghosts of the Five Paths, the ghosts of a hundred monstrous demons, the ghosts that drink human qi and blood, the ghosts that devour essence and brains, the ghosts that seize human souls, the ghosts that deceive with food and drink, the ghosts that enter ears and eyes, the ghosts that invade mouths and noses, the ghosts that consume livers and hearts, the ghosts that lodge in the five viscera, the ghosts that infest the ten fingers, the ghosts that enter the Three Fields, the ghosts that penetrate the seven orifices, the hundred-day corpse-lying ghosts, the ghosts of pestilence and plague, the ghosts of head-aches and belly-pains, the ghosts of heavenly and earthly plagues, the ghosts of five-colored hearts and tongues, the ghosts of southern stars and northern constellations—all such ghosts throughout the ten directions shall kill and harm men.\n\nIf there be faithful men and women who uphold this *Lotus Sutra*, they shall extinguish all ghosts, evil demons, and malevolent spirits. Those born in the final kalpa shall ascend to the Great Luo Heavenly Palace, where all spirit kings shall protect them, preventing untimely or violent death. All other evil ghosts shall be utterly destroyed, and in this life, they shall know peace, sleep without nightmares, fulfill all public and private desires, and have every wish granted—such are the merits and virtues of these causes and conditions.\n\nYet the beings of the southern continent of Jambudvīpa are dull-witted and indolent, turning from the true to the perverse, spurning sages and worthies. They weigh scriptures and teachings, harming others to benefit themselves; they flatter falsely, hoard greedily, kill, harm, and lust; they envy the good and rebel against elders and parents. Their sins pile to the heavens, their evils fill the earth with suffering. They abandon cultivation, wearying themselves in vain. Whether in years of plenty or famine, their fortunes shift unpredictably. Heaven observes, and demonic spirits bring disaster.\n\nBut those who revere true images, honor the teachings, make offerings to the homeless, dig wells to aid the multitudes, and practice the Ten Good Deeds shall gain boundless blessings. Moreover, all beings shall dwell in peace according to their natures, each reaping blessings in proportion to their good or evil. I now reveal this decree—heed it well, receive and uphold it, and do not show it to the unworthy.”\n\nThen all the great Perfected Ones, the heavenly immortals, sages, spirit kings, and the assembled multitude, hearing these teachings, rejoiced greatly. They received and vowed to follow them, bowing before the Dao before departing.\n\nThus concludes the tenth scroll of the *Supreme Middle Dao Wondrous Dharma Lotus Sutra*.",

The Primordial Vast Net**\nAt that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Origin, long ago in the Heaven of the Great Vast Net, within the Palace of Vast Transformations, assembled the hosts of heavenly immortals and expounded the Ten Extremities and the Five Uninterrupted Hells.\n\nThen, among the assembly, there was a perfected one named Zuo Xuan, who knelt before the Dao and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: \"What are the Ten Extremities and the Five Uninterrupted Hells?\"\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy spoke in verse:\n*\"The Boundless fills the empty realm,*\n*Yet sentient beings have never heard.*\n*I gather the hosts of immortals*\n*To broadly expound the gates of liberation.*\n*Cease the bitterness of hell’s torment,*\n*Now awakened as heavenly immortals.*\n*Chants descend from the void,*\n*Sun and moon illuminate the jade terrace.*\n*Hearing the immortals’ words of liberation,*\n*The true immortals rejoice greatly.*\n*They then follow the immortals,*\n*Providing all that is needed.*\n*Gathering firewood and fruits,*\n*Supplying them in due season.*\n*With minds devoted to the wondrous Dharma assembly,*\n*They diligently practice without weariness.*\n*Universally for all sentient beings,*\n*They cultivate the great Dharma.*\n*Wishing to protect their own bodies,*\n*Along with the five grains and medicines.*\n*Thus, for the great kings,*\n*They seek to safeguard this Dharma.*\n*Thereby attaining immortality,*\n*Now I explain it for you.\"*\n\nThen, the Heavenly Worthy addressed the hosts of immortals: \"I now expound this wondrous Dharma for you, so that boundless sentient beings may all attain liberation.\"\n\nImmediately, the hosts of heavenly immortals scattered flower petals, finest incense, sandalwood, aloes, bedding, garments, jeweled ornaments, banners, canopies, and celestial music. They offered these to the seven-jeweled jade terrace, and the immortals and sages of the ten directions, along with boundless sentient beings, took refuge in the immortal Dao.\n\nThen, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy spoke in verse:\n*\"I am the Lord of Heaven,*\n*Dwelling solely in the heavenly realm.*\n*Within the realm of non-action,*\n*Yet I come for the sake of the Dharma.*\n*Why do people not diligently seek the Dharma?*\n*Now the Dharma is profound and mysterious,*\n*Thus I have come here.*\n*For the assembled immortals,*\n*With the power of spiritual penetration,*\n*Like a pure and clean land,*\n*Adorned with lotus flowers.*\n*Beneath those jeweled trees,*\n*All is resplendent with jade.*\n*Fragrant scents emanate from their bodies,*\n*Pervading all the heavenly realms.*\n*Sentient beings, as if perfumed,*\n*Rejoice beyond measure,*\n*Like a great wind*\n*Blowing the branches of small trees.*\n*By this expedient means,*\n*I propagate the Dharma.*\n*I ask the great immortals:*\n*After I conceal myself in the void,*\n*Who will uphold, read, and expound this sutra?*\n*Now, before this assembly,*\n*Declare your vows.*\n*Though Zuo Xuan the Perfected has long concealed himself in the void,*\n*He roars like a lion.*\n*The Primordial Heavenly Worthy,*\n*With his great vows,*\n*Has manifested transformation bodies—*\n*Know this intention,*\n*And that of my own body.*\n*Know this intention, all true disciples:*\n*Whoever upholds the Dharma*\n*Is making offerings to me.*\n*I and Zuo Xuan*\n*Together practice the wondrous Dharma;*\n*This You Xuan*\n*Roams the ten directions.*\n*For the sake of this sutra,*\n*They also make offerings*\n*To the transforming immortals,*\n*Adorning them with radiant splendor.*\n*In all worlds,*\n*Wherever this sutra is expounded,*\n*There the transforming immortals appear,*\n*Along with the hosts of immortals.\"*\n\n#### **2. The Great Transformations**\nThen, among the assembly, the good men each listened and reflected: \"This is a difficult matter; one should make great vows.\"\n\n\"Though the scriptures are countless, and expounding them is not difficult; even if one could toss Mount Sumeru to another realm, this would not be difficult; even if one could move the immortal realms with a toe and cast them into distant lands, this would not be difficult; even if one stood atop the highest peak and expounded this sutra in an evil age, this would be difficult.\n\n\"Even if one could hold the empty void and wander through it, this would not be difficult; if, after my return to heaven, one were to copy this sutra oneself or have another do so, this would be difficult. Even if one could place the great earth on a toenail and ascend to the Brahma Heaven, this would not be difficult; if, after the immortals’ transformations, one were to briefly read this sutra in an evil age, this would be difficult.\n\n\"If, after the immortals’ transformations, one were to expound this sutra to even one person, this would be difficult. Even if one could hold the eighty-four thousand Dharma repositories, the thirty-six divisions of sacred scriptures, and expound them to others, enabling listeners to attain spiritual penetrations and self-mastery, though this is possible, it would not be difficult; if, after the immortals’ transformations, one were to receive this sutra and inquire into its meaning, this would be difficult.\n\n\"Even if one could expound the Dharma to countless, boundless beings, this would not be difficult; if, after the immortals’ transformations, one could uphold such a sutra, this would be difficult.\n\n\"I have become an immortal in countless lands, from the beginning until now, broadly expounding many scriptures, yet among them, this sutra is foremost. If one receives and upholds it, this is cause for rejoicing. They will then follow the immortals, providing all that is needed—gathering fruits, drawing water, picking vegetables, collecting firewood, preparing vegetarian meals, even offering their own bodies as seats, without weariness of body or mind.\"",

Whether he entered the mountains and forests or dwelled in cities and towns, he served others as a humble attendant, never idle or remiss. Reborn in joy, he often sang celestial hymns, free from anger or resentment.\n\nOnce, while traveling, he came to a small kingdom and encountered a lofty mountain. Gazing around, he saw clouds and mist swirling, green waters flowing horizontally. The youth then settled upon this mountain, eating pine and cypress at dawn and resting in rocky valleys at dusk. Days passed like months, and he constantly recited the wondrous scriptures.\n\nA white crane descended from the sky, and the youth befriended it. After several hundred years, celestial boys and jade maidens descended to welcome him, and he met the Original Lord, attaining the Dao and returning to the right path. At that time, the youth harbored no stinginess, greed, jealousy, or the five poisons. Having become an immortal, he descended to the world to dispel demonic toxins, save and deliver the people, and cure their illnesses—such was his conduct.\n\nThis immortal was none other than myself.\n\nAgain, I addressed the heavenly assembly: 'I observe that the people below do not cultivate the Ten Wholesome Paths. I shall transform and deliver those who have not yet attained the immortal Dao. Trapped in the world, they cannot escape the cycle of rebirth—like the fleeting brilliance of the sun, like water gathering, like the plantain’s fragility, like the spark struck from stone. Mortals are like a candle in the wind, like the sprout in a plantain grove, like dreams and illusions, like shadows. Though the spark from stone may linger, though lightning may shine constantly, though the form of affliction may endure—now is the very time for immortals to attain the Dao.\n\nThen, I reflected further: Jade maidens and golden youths, riding feathered chariots across the three mountains, come and go between the jeweled terraces and the Purple Mansion, singing amidst the azure heavens beneath the radiance of sun and moon, ever roaming the boundless void.\n\nThe Nine Grades of Peerless Upper Ministers, the Peerless Upper Grade Flowing Rosy Clouds Immortals, and the Peerless Wondrous Grade Left Mystery Immortals—born with me, they dwell in the celestial realms, together discussing the lower world.\n\nYet beings burdened by evil karma who do not cultivate the wondrous Dharma shall never attain liberation.'\"",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Eight: The Measure of Teaching**\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy addressed the assembly of celestial beings: \"It is like the great sea containing all lesser seas, never overflowing. Now, as you celestial hosts transform and enlighten the deluded multitudes, let the beings of the lower realms below never grow weary. Day and night, with diligent devotion, they must recite the boundless wondrous scriptures a thousand myriad times, contemplating the mind as empty as space.\n\nFurther, they shall manifest wondrous arts, displaying myriad transformations—bodies towering ten thousand *zhang*, heads reaching the heavens, feet treading the great sea, summoning clouds and calling forth rain. From beneath their feet, water flows; from their heads, fire blazes. From their heads, water pours; from their feet, fire erupts. Such divine powers are all for the sake of teaching and transformation.\n\nIf one is gravely ill, they shall manifest as a skilled physician. If one is bound in shackles, they shall manifest liberation. If one is upon a perilous path, they shall manifest a guide. If one is drowning in rivers or lakes, they shall manifest a boat. If one is harmed by demonic spirits, they shall manifest the dispelling of malevolence.\n\nAll things soar through the void—flying dragons and galloping steeds, scattering radiant jade terraces, myriad flutes and songs—so that heavenly beings may hear, hells cease their torments, and all demonic spirits flee far away.\n\nAt that time, a Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct within the assembly spoke these verses:\n\nHeavy emptiness, heaven’s blossoms fill,\nTranscending the Dharma assembly, they come.\nSuch are the transformations of heavenly beings,\nDharma rain moistens the vast sky.\n\nCranes dance by the cinnabar halls,\nPhoenixes sing before hidden grottoes.\nAll numinous signs of the void,\nCountless since time immemorial.\n\nJade maidens and golden youths attend,\nFlowing rosy clouds illuminate the Purple Void.\nSinging upon the Azure Vault Terrace,\nPacing the Void by the decree of the Primordial Sovereign.\n\nTo rescue beings from suffering,\nWhen those below hear,\nDisciples of the Dao, all immortals,\nGreat vows gather in non-action.\nHolding the scriptures deep within caves,\nStudying arts in ancient terraces.\n\nManifesting beyond the world,\nYet not grasping the mysteries of the wondrous scriptures,\nThey cannot avoid meeting the Primordial Sovereign,\nWho expounds subtle and wondrous words.\n\nHearing the *Carefree Chapter*,\nProclaimed together with the *Yellow Court*,\nRain moistens the parched earth’s medicine,\nGradually growing fragrant.\nUpon hearing the true and wondrous Dao,\nOne shall never again encounter the wheel of rebirth.\n\nWhether great or small branches and sprouts,\nThe hundred kinds of grasses and vines,\nAll immortal disciples,\nTogether transcend the mysteries of suffering.\nThey transform the sins of the Nine Dark Realms\nInto weariness for ascent to heaven,\nAll afflictions\nAre purified for the assembly of Perfected Ones.\"\n\n**The Wondrous Dharma Lotus Sutra of the Middle Dao of the Most High, Scroll Four (Ends)**\n\n**The Wondrous Dharma Lotus Sutra of the Middle Dao of the Most High, Scroll Five**\n\n**Chapter Nine: The Nine Dark Realms**\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy spoke of the illnesses of all beings in the lower realms. Devout Daoists were entreated to purify their homes, adorn their dwellings, establish altars, and reverently prepare incense and candles, rare fruits and precious flowers, offering them according to the Dharma. If one recites this wondrous scripture—one scroll, two scrolls, or even seven scrolls—the illness shall be cured, afflictions shall cease, and naturally, coolness and joy shall arise, with boundless suffering forever dispelled.\n\nOr, if one chants over water and sprinkles it upon the sick, they shall attain coolness. If one’s life is ending, instruct them with words, so that the sick may relinquish attachment. All possessions used should be presented before the Three Treasures by the revered master, who shall loudly proclaim the offering. Thus, the life shall be dedicated, and the sick shall perceive impermanence as a dream, spared the bitterness of hellish retribution.\n\nIf this person in a past life made offerings, every coin was received. Even posthumous cultivation was performed with utmost purity, born of sincere reverence, never slighting the sacred Perfected Ones of the Three Treasures. All homeless Daoists of the empty void, their hearts filled with joy, shall fully receive merit, clearly manifesting in future lives.\n\nThe hells and animal realms arise from the mind’s deeds—thousands of transformations, myriad changes. Some take form through transformation, others through womb or egg, receiving life and karma. Even if one’s merit is but a fraction, not half, nor a hundred thousandfold, it cannot compare. Thus, ever-increasing blessings follow, and as one receives life and karma, so it shall be.\n\n**Chapter Ten: The Multitudes of Transformations**\n\nAt that time, the Perfected One of Wondrous Unity ascended and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: \"I shall exhort and transform all beings to swiftly attain immortality.\" Then he spoke these verses:\n\nPraising the wondrous scriptures above,\nAdorned with a hundred treasures’ patterns and hues,\nOffering rare fruits and flowers,\nWith music, grotto hymns, and songs.\n\nHolding banners, encircling,\nWith hearts of abundant offering,\nReverently presenting rare and precious treasures,\nAll to honor the sacred image.\n\nAbandoning all possessions,\nThus attaining a liberated heart,\nMerit surpassing the natural,\nLike flowers, wondrous and joyous.\n\nA thousand sages taught this,\nTen thousand cares forgotten in pursuit.\nAll celestial immortals who come\nUphold the wondrous Dharma scriptures.\n\nSpeaking of love and joy,\nBeings’ karma not yet exhausted,\nWhen karma is spent, merit remains light,\nForever severing the retribution of rebirth.\n\nImmortal music harmonizes,\nWelcoming return to the Nine Terraces,\nTogether speaking of the joy of longevity,\nSuffering and sorrow never intrude.\n\nAzure Vault’s true and wondrous songs,\nImmortal blossoms upon them,\nRare music in the world,\nAt times reaching the Jasper Pool.\n\nMist and rosy clouds, deep and distant,\nSilent and desolate, beyond the perilous streams,\nAutumn winds suffuse the night moon,\nGreen bamboo, emerald and purple gates.\n\nAt this time, the heart’s cultivation is complete,\nNever again to revolve in rebirth.\nThe path lies clear and bright,\nYet worldly beings remain deluded.\n\nRoaming beyond the celestial realms,\nOne may yet attend the Primordial Sovereign.\"\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy wished to journey among the heavens, expounding the *Boundless Wondrous Dharma Lotus Sutra* to the celestial hosts. Within the assembly, a Perfected One named Flowing Rosy Clouds ascended and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: \"Since ancient times, I have attained the Dao, yet never heard this scripture. Now, as the Primordial Sovereign expounds this wondrous scripture, my heart rejoices, pondering it day and night. Yet many beings endure suffering, never hearing the wondrous scripture—what is this wondrous Dharma? I shall inform the celestial hosts, together exhorting the good men and women of the world to transmit and transform, even a single scroll, seven scrolls, or a thousand myriad scrolls. Their merit shall be boundless, their virtue immeasurable.\"",

Constantly committing evil, delighting in killing, consuming flesh and blood, scorning the Ten Virtues; uttering harsh words, sowing discord, slandering the sages and Perfected, insulting sacred images, stealing offerings. First tasting myriad flavors, they fell into the ghostly realm, passing through a thousand kalpas without the chance to cycle back into human form. Now, encountering the Perfected One and receiving the Sovereign’s decree, we observe all ghosts and spirits, forsaking the karma of uninterrupted suffering. We beseech the Perfected One, for our sake, to expound this *Wondrous Dharma Lotus Sutra*, that we may follow in cultivating the Dao and ascend together as Perfected Immortals.

Those who awaken to the Perfected shall behold the ranks of the sages, mastering unimpeded wisdom. They shall deliver the deluded masses, subdue evil demons, and with their divine powers encircle the world, guarding the sacred altars and temples in mountains, forests, wilds, valleys, and secluded ravines, protecting all immortal disciples who cultivate the Dao. You, ghost kings, having received my decree, shall return to the path of immortals, seeking and studying eternal life.\"\n\nThen, the Primordial Sovereign praised in verse:\n*\"Demons return to the true Dao,\nSubduing all evil ghosts.\nThough they attain the joy of eternal life,\nThey roam freely, naturally at ease.\nAiding the Dao through a thousand myriad kalpas,\nEver dwelling as immortals upon the seas,\nAt night they attend the Huaqing Palace,\nAt dawn they wander the peaks of the Five Marchmounts.\nDispelling evil beyond the Eastern Sea,\nGathering mists to purify the world.\nHolding fire to illuminate the void,\nMoving mountains with but a small effort,\nExhaling to fill deep valleys,\nObscuring the moon to reach Penglai Palace.\"*\n\nThereupon, the ghost kings bowed deeply, kneeling to address the Heavenly Worthy: \"Since becoming ghosts, we have governed the world’s evil spirits, preventing them from harming the people and protecting all children.

Whether keeping lamps lit day and night or making offerings all day long, from the beginningless past until now, I have never heard of this sutra called the *Wondrous Dharma Lotus Sutra*, nor has anyone been able to uphold it. If one recites and transmits this sutra, the sick shall recover, and all demonic misfortunes be dispelled. Let all Daoist masters widely propagate it to deliver the people.\n\nIf one slanders or reviles it, they shall lose their true nature for generations, falling into poverty and lowliness, enduring suffering in solitude, constantly afflicted by grave illness.

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Fifteen: The Forms of Heaven and Earth**\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Celestial Venerable was in the Seven Jeweled Grove of the Great Brahma Heaven, convening with all the celestial immortals, great sages, and perfected beings, expounding the wondrous Dharma.\n\nThen, the Perfected of Universal Virtue and Wondrous Conduct arose from his seat, adjusted his cap and robes, touched his head to the ground in prostration, and knelt in reverence. Holding his tablet before him, he advanced and addressed the Celestial Venerable:\n\n\"Previously, I received and upheld the verses of the *Dharma Lotus Sutra* as you expounded them, yet I have not fully awakened to their meaning. I now humbly beseech the Celestial Venerable: we perfected beings traverse the ten directions and boundless worlds day and night, teaching and transforming sentient beings. Yet we do not know the height of heaven and the depth of earth, the shallows and depths of rivers and streams, or the movements and measures of the sun, moon, and stars. I pray that the Celestial Venerable, in your compassion, will explain these causes to us perfected beings, that all in this assembly may hear and understand.\"\n\nAt that time, the Celestial Venerable replied: \"You perfected beings, I shall now distinguish and explain these matters for you. Listen carefully and reflect deeply upon them.\n\nThe depth of what you ask is profound: first, there is a layer twenty billion *li* deep; next, a fragrant, moist layer, also twenty billion *li* deep; then, layers of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, giant clamshell, agate, coral, amber, and all manner of wondrous treasures, forty billion *li* deep; next, a layer of golden grain-sand, eighty billion *li* deep; then, a layer of diamond ore, ten billion *li* deep; next, a layer of silver grain-sand, one hundred billion *li* deep; and finally, a layer of silver diamond ore, two hundred billion *li* deep. Beneath all this lies the boundless great wind, which bears the great earth, keeping it from tilting or shaking. Thus are the measures of heaven and earth, and the depths of rivers and streams, all known.\n\nAll things under heaven—mountains and forests, trees and groves, the Yangtze, Huai, and Ji rivers, great seas and small seas, ravines and springs, pools and ditches, gullies and valleys, wells and marshes, streams and fountains, mulberry thickets and forests, all varieties of herbs and grasses, fragrant scents, and the hues of blue, yellow, red, white, and black—all arise and grow from the great earth.\n\nThere are earthen mountains, rocky mountains, inner mountains, the Great Iron Enclosure Mountain, the Lesser Iron Enclosure Mountain, Mount Meru, the Diamond Mountain, and all manner of wondrous jeweled mountains. Among them, the Fire Mountain of the Azure Vault and the Jade Mountain of All Mountains surge forth with the four treasures, towering above all. All these wondrous jeweled mountains are formed from the treasures that well forth from the great earth.\n\nMount Meru is composed of the four treasures, surging upward to surpass all. The mountains and rivers of the world are divided into four directions: the south is lapis lazuli, the west is crystal, the north is agate, and the east is gold. Their radiance illuminates the four quarters of the world, and all together they are called the Four Heavens.\n\nMount Meru is where the Four Heavenly Kings, the Protectors of the World, reside, guarding and stabilizing the four directions.\n\nWhat is Mount Meru? To the south, there are immeasurable seven-jeweled palaces, ten thousand *li* above the earth. Within them dwells the Heavenly King Virūḍhaka, whose body is twenty-five *li* tall, with a lifespan of eighty-seven thousand years. His clothing and food arise naturally. There are also men and women within, each twenty-five *li* tall, whose clothing and food likewise arise naturally. All beings in Jambudvīpa who receive the Three Refuges and Nine Precepts, honor their parents, serve their teachers, and worship the Three Venerables without transgression may be reborn there.\n\nTo the west of Mount Meru, there are immeasurable seven-jeweled palaces, one million *li* above the earth. Within them dwells the Heavenly King Virūpākṣa, whose body is twenty-five *li* tall, with a lifespan of eighty-seven thousand years. His clothing and food arise naturally. All beings in Jambudvīpa who receive the Three Refuges and Five Precepts, honor their parents, serve their teachers, and worship the Three Venerables without transgression may be reborn there.\n\nTo the north of Mount Meru, there are also immeasurable seven-jeweled palaces, one million *li* above the earth. Within them dwells the Heavenly King Vaiśravaṇa, whose body is twenty-five *li* tall, with a lifespan of eighty-seven thousand years. His clothing and food arise naturally. There are also men and women within, each twenty-five *li* tall, whose clothing and food likewise arise naturally. All beings in Jambudvīpa who receive the Three Refuges and Five Precepts, honor their parents, serve their teachers, and worship the Three Venerables without transgression may be reborn there.\n\nTo the east of Mount Meru, there are also immeasurable seven-jeweled palaces, one million *li* above the earth. Within them dwells the Heavenly King Dhṛtarāṣṭra, whose body is twenty-five *li* tall. The lifespans, body sizes, clothing, and food of all the men and women there are the same. All beings in Jambudvīpa who cultivate good conduct, uphold the Three Refuges and Five Precepts, honor their parents, serve their teachers, and worship the Three Venerables without transgression may be reborn there.\n\nThe abode of the Wheel-Turning Sage King is also adorned with immeasurable seven-jeweled palaces, two million *li* above the earth. At that time, the Wheel-Turning Sage King, all his ministers, and his retinue are each twenty-three *li* tall, with lifespans of two hundred fifty thousand years. Their clothing and food arise naturally. The Wheel-Turning Sage King and his princes all ride upon great seven-jeweled conveyances, traveling through the four continents to teach and transform all beings. Those who uphold the Three Refuges and Five Precepts, cultivate the Ten Good Deeds, refrain from all evil, receive, uphold, recite, and study the *Wondrous Dharma Lotus Sutra*, and follow their heart’s desires may be reborn there. There are also immeasurable seven-jeweled palaces where men and women are twenty-five *li* tall, with lifespans of two hundred fifty thousand years. Their clothing and food arise naturally, and they lack nothing.\n\nAbove Mount Meru is the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, the foremost of the heavens, where lifespans are immeasurable.\"",

The sun travels along three paths: in winter, it follows the northern path; in summer, the southern path; and in spring and autumn, the central path. Gold and crystal form the sun; silver and lapis lazuli form the moon; and all the stars are made of silver. Each resides according to its size, all enjoying bliss, free and unbound.\n\nAs for the sun being composed of gold and mercury: in summer, the crystal recedes entirely, and the gold appears fully, aided by the wheel of fire. Mount Sumeru possesses a hundred million vajras, all of which contribute to the heat. Since the sun travels along the southern path above the Fire Mountain, the entire world becomes intensely hot. In winter, the wheel of fire departs, the gold recedes entirely, and the crystal appears fully, aided by the wheel of water. As the sun travels along the northern path above the Water Mountain, the entire world becomes extremely cold.\n\nThe moon, residing in the heavens, illuminates the world with a single radiance, yet within a month, it waxes and wanes. Why is this so? The moon is composed of silver and lapis lazuli. When the lapis lazuli is concealed and the silver appears, the world is bright. After fifteen days, it gradually turns, and by the thirtieth day, the silver is concealed and the lapis lazuli appears, so the world grows dark.\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy addressed the Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct, saying: \"All beings in the four directions of the world differ from one another.

They are not born from the wombs of parents but are all transformed from lotus flowers. Clothing and food appear naturally upon their bodies, growing with them. When they eat, great treasure bowls—made of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, giant clamshell, agate, coral, and amber—appear of their own accord according to the season. Heavenly kitchens fill these bowls with a hundred flavors, fragrant and delicious. Eating them, one’s qi and strength are harmonized, the body becomes upright and majestic, wisdom and intelligence are keen, talents and understanding are brilliant, and the spiritual powers and virtues are inconceivable.\n\nAll beings in the northern continent of Uttarakuru are twenty *li* in height and live for a thousand years. Though there are men and women, there is no licentiousness. Males are born from their fathers’ sides, and females are transformed from their mothers’ sides. Clothing and food appear naturally, their qi is abundant, their bodies are at peace, and they suffer no illness—this too is inconceivable.\n\nAll beings in the eastern continent of Pūrvavideha are nine *li* in height and live for five hundred years. Though they till the soil, there are no royal taxes, nor do they suffer from thieves, fire, water, illness, or poverty. Why is this? In the southern continent of Jambudvīpa, all beings have short, fragile bodies and brief lifespans, enduring much sorrow, affliction, and hardship. The longest-lived reach a hundred years, while the short-lived perish in the womb or die young. Even after being born, they constantly suffer from cold and hunger. Since they rely on their parents for upbringing and depend on their own strength, they toil to provide for themselves. Their natures are stingy and greedy, they lack self-awareness, disdain the sacred teachings, and betray the sages—thus they receive such karmic retribution.\n\nThe beings of Jambudvīpa, Uttarakuru, and Pūrvavideha enjoy bodily bliss and extended lifespans because they diligently cultivate progress, make offerings to their teachers, uphold the scriptures with purity, and perfect their merit and conduct—thus they receive such karmic retribution and are born among them. Even in the southern continent of Jambudvīpa, those who cultivate good deeds, leave the household life, protect the precepts and scriptures, and perfect purity may, according to their wishes, also be born among them.\"\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy restated this meaning and spoke in verse:\n\n\"Listen well, all of you,\nI shall now make this clear,\nSo that all this great assembly\nMay hear without doubt.\nI expound this wondrous Dao,\nListen without confusion:\n\nThe great earth is vast and deep,\nTwo hundred ten thousand *li*;\nNext lies a fragrant, moist layer,\nTwenty thousand *li* deep;\nThen a layer of various treasures—\nGold, silver, and glass,\nGiant clamshell, agate,\nCarnelian, lapis lazuli, and pearls—\nAll these precious treasures\nExtend four billion *li*.\n\nAll the great seas,\nBoth great and small,\nRivers, streams, and valleys,\nMedicinal herbs and forests,\nEverything in the world\nArises from the earth.\n\nBlack mountains, earthen mountains,\nAnd all the Meru Mountains,\nIron mountains, the Great Iron-Encompassing,\nVajra and Sumeru—\nAll emerge from this great earth,\nBringing forth treasures.\n\nOnly Mount Sumeru,\nKing of all mountains,\nIs formed of four treasures,\nTowering above the world.\nWhat are these four called?\nThe southern is lapis lazuli,\nThe western is glass,\nThe northern is agate,\nThe eastern is gold—\nThus it is called the Four Treasures.\n\nThe Four Heavenly Kings who guard the world\nDwell there accordingly.\nKings and all men and women\nAre twenty-five *li* in height,\nLive eighty-seven thousand years,\nAnd their clothing and food appear naturally.\n\nThe palaces of the Wheel-Turning King\nAre two hundred *li* above the earth.\nHis lifespan and body,\nAnd all treasures, are no different.\n\nAt that time, the Wheel-Turning King\nRides the great heavenly treasure chariot,\nTraveling through the four continents,\nTeaching and transforming all beings.\nThose who cultivate good deeds\nWill surely be born there,\nTheir clothing, food, and lifespan\nAll equal, without difference.\n\nAll the heavenly sages and worthies\nDwell atop Mount Sumeru.\nThe heavenly beings there\nNaturally enjoy bliss,\nLiving for billions of kalpas,\nTheir clothing and food appearing naturally.\n\nIn Jambudvīpa, those who\nDiligently uphold the precepts,\nMake offerings to the heavenly perfected,\nWill surely be born there.\"",

Then the Perfected of Salvation from Suffering came forward, bowed his head, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: \"This disciple’s nature is dull and ignorant. By good fortune, I have been able to attend upon the immortals and hear the wondrous principles, which have opened my benighted mind. I venture to ask: Why are the sufferings and joys of the beings in Jambudvīpa unequal? Why do they experience such disparities in wealth and poverty, nobility and lowliness, long life and early death? I humbly beseech the Heavenly Compassion to especially grant enlightenment.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"Excellent, excellent! The Perfected One is able to inquire wisely. I shall now expound this for you. The places where beings are born—whether in toil or ease—are the retributions of their karmic deeds. Some perform good deeds, while others do not. Some dwell in the domains of wealth, nobility, longevity, and blessings, while others dwell in poverty and lowliness. The causes of good and evil are distant, whether fragrant or foul, and cannot be equal. It is like the sun and moon, whose light shines impartially, or like all the immortals and heavenly hosts, who universally know all things through the radiance of their wisdom. Beings are born within the Six Paths. If they believe in and understand the scriptures, hear the true Dharma, and transform into immortals and heavenly beings, their wisdom will neither increase nor diminish. If their merit is abundant, they will behold the Three Supreme Worthies. What difference is there in the natures of these beings? It is like vessels made from the same clay: some hold treasures, while others hold filth. Each is used according to the preferences of its recipient, with various differences in their arrangements. This is the One Vehicle, or the Two Vehicles, and then the Three Vehicles. If there are beings who can uphold the Three Vehicles, take refuge in the true Dao, and believe in and understand its various aspects, they will attain the way of liberation through the corpse, and next become great immortals. Therefore, I now reiterate this exhortation. Why do the preferences of beings differ so greatly? Some beings see the sun, moon, and stars, while others do not—what is the principle behind this? It corresponds to the places where beings dwell in the world, born and raised without recognizing the true and correct. If they first committed evil deeds, now their illnesses arise, and there are four kinds: wind, jaundice, phlegm, and *yan*. These reverse and become calamities in due time, leading to early death. Out of compassion for beings, I now arise with expedient means to proclaim this sutra. If there are beings who can receive and uphold it with courage and diligence, without retrogression, this is the good medicine that cures all illnesses. Within it, they will fathom its meaning, gradually ascend to the true path, like removing obstacles, and perceive clearly both within and without, near and far. When I first received the transmission, I attained such awakening to the mysterious, and only then did I gain the eye to see clearly. I first comprehended the wondrous Dharma, recognized the Dharma of non-emptiness, and thus made myself unsurpassable.\"",

      "translated_text": "The meaning of \"I\" does not compare to the six penetrations—clairvoyant sight, clairaudient hearing, knowledge of others' minds, recollection of past lives, or the perfection of wisdom. Now I can fathom the profound and wondrous, employing the Dao to succor all things, sheltering even the tiniest crawling creatures and faintest glimmers. Yet I observe that beings utterly lack understanding: they take darkness for light and light for darkness, indulging in indolence and arrogance, their minds devoid of wisdom. Good is scarce while evil abounds, just as within this assembly—how can they be called discerning? Far-off forms they cannot see, nearby sounds they cannot hear. Whether beings' minds incline toward good or evil, their conduct stands at the threshold of the Way, yet they walk without arriving; though it is manifestly clear, they gaze without perceiving.\n\nBy what expedient means can I save and deliver them? If beings wish to awaken, they must cast aside sensory pleasures, relinquish their attachments, sit in secluded mountains, contemplate the subtle, and sever the nets of doubt—only then will they attain spiritual penetrations. Shielded and protected, they may leave the household life, don the robe, and pay homage to the Three Treasures. Within this Dao, they should reflect on prior conduct. Through this cause, all merits may be realized; as they contemplate, the profound principles of the supreme vehicle will be fully grasped. Reaching the pivot of the Dao, they will join the ranks of the immortals.\n\nYet there are beings of little wisdom and scant discernment, like those born blind, who cannot perceive good fruits. They only commit evil deeds, unaware of the ultimate intent, deluded by afflictions, their conduct rarely accumulating merit. Through karmic conditions, they forfeit longevity, goodness, wealth, and nobility, and instead receive premature death, misfortune, poverty, and lowliness. Such beings abide in the midst of cyclic existence, never escaping the cage, scarcely transcending the wondrous Dao.\n\nUpon hearing these words, the Perfected One Who Saves from Suffering felt deep compassion, fearing that beings would forever sink into evil destinies. He again addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: \"I now vow to deliver them, to free them from the wheel of rebirth.\"\n\nThen the Heavenly Worthy, leaning on his armrest, declared: \"Excellent, excellent! You now harbor such a vow. Like parents cherishing their infant child, you bestow nurture, enact deliverance, and rescue beings. This scripture is named the *Dharma Blossom*, pervading empty space, universally aiding immortals and guides, leading the deluded to escape the three realms and behold the supreme immortals.\n\nSome beings, due to past lives where good was scarce and evil abundant, fail to distinguish purity and truth, drowning instead in greed, anger, and desire. Thus they suffer from wind, jaundice, phlegm, and *yan*, or sudden cold and violent afflictions. With this scripture, you may treat them according to their conditions, and they will gradually recover, attaining liberation and aligning with the ultimate truth. Light will become constant and clear, while ignorance will vanish. Abiding in goodness, they will gain the eye to perceive vibrant colors, attain the mysterious origin, cast off the six dusts, forever extinguish the three evil destinies, escape the three realms, and no longer drown in the wheel of rebirth. Within the three vehicles, they will grasp the profound principle, their bodies radiating light, fulfilling their desires at will—this is called the wondrous Dao.\"\n\nThen the Heavenly Worthy reiterated this meaning and composed a verse:\n\nThe two lights of sun and moon shine,\nEqually illuminating without bounds,\nLike a single comet,\nIts radiance like sun and moon.\n\nSaliva fills vessels for use,\nEach holding what it may—\nPrecious treasures or filth,\nLight or heavy, all differ.\n\nGood and evil follow what is possessed,\nRetribution metes out suffering or joy.\nIf one clings to various dharmas,\nThis is called \"sitting in delusion.\"\n\nLike one born blind,\nWho sees neither sun, moon, nor stars,\nYet claims there are no colors—\nSuch is their speech.\n\nOnce given the right medicine,\nAfflictions dissipate, and colors and flavors are known.\nThese four kinds,\nCombined, effect the cure.\n\nThus the born-blind,\nDay by day, gain light,\nYet lacking wisdom, they tread the path of suffering—\nSuch is the folly of the world.\n\nOnly the supreme Perfected One knows all this,\nThose who follow the Dao’s master\nHave already escaped the three realms.\n\nThe Perfected One, with compassionate heart,\nPities those who possess such wisdom,\nYet rummage through storehouses,\nWhere sounds and sights remain distant.\n\nThus they dwell apart,\nOthers as you are—\nWhether good or evil in mind,\nYou cannot know them.\n\nIf you wish to approach the numinous,\nYet do not take a step, you cannot go.\nWhen you contemplate them,\nYou will attain spiritual penetrations.\n\nIf you deem seclusion empty,\nContemplate the subtle and purify your resolve,\nEntering stillness,\nThe Perfected One will deliver the world.\n\nPractice the six perfections with purity,\nStillness is without destination.\nCultivate all virtues,\nFor all mountains are not separate.\n\nEach dharma is still and empty,\nAll four kinds of conduct—\nTeaching and transforming beings,\nEven gods and humans praise them.\n\nAll dharmas are equal,\nAll paths of birth possess wisdom.\nEquality is inherent,\nThe Dao’s dharma flows from heaven.\n\n*Tai Shang Zhong Dao Miao Fa Lian Hua Jing*, Scroll Nine, concludes.\n*Tai Shang Zhong Dao Miao Fa Lian Hua Jing*, Scroll Ten.",

      "translated_text": "Now we observe the degeneracy of customs and the afflictions of the people—many suffer poverty, premature death, and untimely demise. Fathers and sons, men and women are neither loyal nor filial, neither righteous nor benevolent. They constantly endure famine, and illness and hardship ever befall them. The disparity between past and present remains unperceived, and they dare not awaken to understanding. We humbly beseech the Merciful Worthy to broadly expound and enlighten the deluded and lost.\n\nWithin this worldly net, they hunt and trap birds and beasts, slaughtering living beings. They hoard wealth and goods, unable to bestow charity. They slight and neglect their parents while cherishing their wives and children. Devoid of propriety and righteousness, they are deluded by lust and desire. Their hearts harbor jealousy, and their minds conjure heterodoxies.\n\nThough they may possess the sacred scriptures, they neither reflect upon nor recite them from dawn to dusk, allowing their pages to fray and their scrolls to decay. Never having heard the sagacious titles of the Heavenly Worthy, how can they cultivate good causes? How can blessings and fortune arise?\n\nSuch beings, day and night, are recorded by the True Controllers. Whenever the six fasts, ten auspicious days, three primal festivals, five seasonal rites, or the three assemblies occur, their merits and transgressions are examined, their good and evil tallied, and their faults and errors accumulated. Now they receive their retribution—sin and evil fill their accounts. Moreover, they drown in the sea of suffering, adrift in the river of desire.\n\nNot only do they themselves endure calamity and hardship, but their misfortune extends to the nine generations of descendants and implicates the seven generations of ancestors. The dark bureaus investigate and compare, consigning them to Fengdu, where they suffer for ten thousand kalpas without hope of release.\n\nAt that time, all the Great Perfected Ones, hearing these words, were struck with terror. They entreated the Great Compassion to specially bestow salvation and deliverance.\n\nThen the Heavenly Worthy declared: “I now expound this wondrous scripture to save and deliver all beings. You should listen attentively, transmit its teachings to the world, and circulate it through recitation.\n\nIf mortals of the dusty realm possess good faith, study the Dao, cultivate practice, and uphold the recitation of scriptures, they must first purify their attire and cover their bodies. They must not expose themselves. If their minds generate distractions or their thoughts remain impure, harboring disdain, the winds will blow them straight into the inverted hell, where their sins and suffering will only increase—how could they escape?\n\nIf they can contemplate the Dao and reflect upon the True, even a single utterance or two, it will still dissolve their suffering and misfortune. If they can diligently transcribe the thirty-six sacred scriptures and disseminate them throughout the world, universally exhorting the worthy and common folk of karmic affinity to recite and uphold this scripture, they will obtain boundless blessings.\n\nThose who personally perform good deeds—establishing temples, constructing bridges, distributing grain, cloth, wealth, treasures, and clothing; sacrificing for the benefit of others; aiding orphans and cherishing widows; and upholding the Ten Precepts and the Twenty-Four Precepts—accumulate merit and virtue, praying for future blessings, not merely for the people of this age.\n\nYet such beings recklessly indulge in deceit and falsehood, their hearts set on killing. They incline toward heterodox teachings, indulge in wine and lust, and make no distinction between kin and stranger. They are miserly, jealous, and envious; scheming for profit, they refuse to practice charity. They contend and seize from one another, failing to relieve the poor and destitute. They commit all manner of unlawful acts, amassing evil deeds, and do not uphold the precepts.\n\nThese beings incur heavenly censure, and all manner of malevolent spirits and ghosts pursue them, cutting short their lifespans and casting them into poverty and lowliness, where the five blessings are incomplete.\n\nThen the Heavenly Worthy commanded the Perfected Ones: “Protect and support such people, ensuring their comings and goings are unimpeded, without obstacles or difficulties.”\n\nIf kings, queens, crown princes, ministers, and all the people of the realm delight in the heavens, they will enjoy peace and happiness day and night. If they uphold the precepts with a sincere heart, bathe their five limbs, and recite this *Dharma Flower Sutra*, a hundred illnesses will vanish, and a thousand calamities will disperse.\n\nBut if they grow lax, scoff, slander, speak evil or reckless words, or disbelieve in the scriptures, such people will incur immeasurable karmic retribution and fall into the uninterrupted hell. Those who revere and believe in the scriptures will gain boundless blessings, be reborn among humans or in the heavens, and enjoy all manner of happiness.”\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy further expounded the preceding meaning and spoke this gatha:\n\n“I now proclaim this wondrous gatha,\nAll its words are true and real.\nLet all beings heed and believe,\nFor those who disbelieve the scriptures\nShall fall into the three evil destinies.\nHow could the Perfected Ones of the heavens\nNot return to the Dao?\nNow, seeing the demons subdued,\nThey bow their heads in reverence and come to welcome.\nI proclaim these gatha words,\nThe wondrous Dharma of the true scriptures.\nThose who take refuge, robe themselves in faith,\nShall see their blessings and kindness ever increase.”\n\nThen the Heavenly Worthy instructed the Perfected Ones: “Five hundred years hence, you may descend to the lands of Jambudvīpa and the Middle Kingdom of Zhendan to propagate and transform. At that time, the people of the world will lack goodness, engaging only in killing. Their hair will turn white in their prime, their natures akin to beasts. Men and women will be stunted, their bodies barely over a foot tall. They will not cultivate the five grains but subsist on grass seeds, dwelling entirely beneath the grass.”",

      "translated_text": "On the ninth day of the ninth month, calamities shall descend from heaven: mountains shall crumble, rocks shall strike, and the four seas shall wither of themselves. All beings shall kill and devour one another. Great transformations shall unfold—grasses and trees, flowers and leaves shall become blades and spears, and any who are struck shall perish. Bones shall pile into mountains, blood shall pool into lakes, reeking and foul, unbearable to approach.\n\nThen the Wind Deity Kings of Heat and Cold, along with all lesser wind deities, shall blow upon the corpses, heaping them into towering mounds. For one year or even ten, the Great Year-Wind King shall scatter these evils like fine dust, leveling them smooth as a palm. Thereafter, vast floods shall rise, eighty feet high, seething like boiling water, impossible to draw near. After five or ten years, the waters shall wash away the filth, the foulness dissolving into mud, the great waters receding to form land, the lesser waters carving streams and valleys. Bubbles upon the waters shall sprout into trees, and through the span of a small thousand-world kalpa, the earth shall harden once more, both above and below, all else likewise restored.\n\nI shall first dispatch the Golden Crested Birds to descend and circle the earth, discerning the good and evil among men and women. Those of profound good roots who uphold this *Lotus Sutra* shall be delivered, spared from these sufferings. But those who neglect precepts and fasts, whose natures are steeped in lust, who kill, steal, hoard, and covet; who speak deceitfully, slander, sow discord, and deceive the foolish; who turn from kin toward strangers, revile sages and immortals, and disrespect the scriptures—such beings, their sins piled high, shall reap boundless suffering. Upon death, they shall fall into the Fengdu Hell of Uninterrupted Torment, enduring agony for ten thousand kalpas, lost in eternal darkness with no hope of escape.\n\nYet if there be faithful men and women—whether Daoist, lay, or Confucian—who chant, sing, and praise the *Cavernous Scriptures*, playing zithers, harps, sheng, xiao, zithers, flutes, drums, and cymbals; who offer incense, flowers, fine fruits, and reverence to the Three Treasures and the assembly of perfected immortals and sages—shall gain immeasurable blessings.\n\nAt that time, in the western continent of Godāniya, there shall be such joy: myriad melodies shall resound day and night in all six watches, and strange beasts, spirit birds, winds, clouds, and trees shall all offer homage, their harmonies refined and solemn. In the northern continent of Uttarakuru, all beings shall contemplate the true Dharma, their clothing and food arising naturally, each delighting as they please. When their lives end, they shall be freed from all suffering. In the eastern continent of Pūrvavideha, beings shall cultivate the true and good Dharma, dwelling in temples and pavilions where music arises of itself.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy again addressed the assembly of Perfected Ones: “I now decree and admonish all spirits and ghosts who follow men: each must reflect inwardly and outwardly. There are the ghosts of the Towering Immortal Loft, the ghosts of those struck by fire, the ghosts of heavenly and earthly deities, the ghosts of mountain and tree spirits, the mighty ghosts of the Five Paths, the ghosts of a hundred monstrous demons, the ghosts that drink human qi and blood, the ghosts that devour essence and brains, the ghosts that seize human souls, the ghosts that deceive with food and drink, the ghosts that enter ears and eyes, the ghosts that invade mouths and noses, the ghosts that consume livers and hearts, the ghosts that lodge in the five viscera, the ghosts that infest the ten fingers, the ghosts that enter the Three Fields, the ghosts that penetrate the seven orifices, the hundred-day corpse-lying ghosts, the ghosts of pestilence and plague, the ghosts of head-aches and belly-pains, the ghosts of heavenly and earthly plagues, the ghosts of five-colored hearts and tongues, the ghosts of southern stars and northern constellations—all such ghosts throughout the ten directions shall kill and harm men.\n\nIf there be faithful men and women who uphold this *Lotus Sutra*, they shall extinguish all ghosts, evil demons, and malevolent spirits. Those born in the final kalpa shall ascend to the Great Luo Heavenly Palace, where all spirit kings shall protect them, preventing untimely or violent death. All other evil ghosts shall be utterly destroyed, and in this life, they shall know peace, sleep without nightmares, fulfill all public and private desires, and have every wish granted—such are the merits and virtues of these causes and conditions.\n\nYet the beings of the southern continent of Jambudvīpa are dull-witted and indolent, turning from the true to the perverse, spurning sages and worthies. They weigh scriptures and teachings, harming others to benefit themselves; they flatter falsely, hoard greedily, kill, harm, and lust; they envy the good and rebel against elders and parents. Their sins pile to the heavens, their evils fill the earth with suffering. They abandon cultivation, wearying themselves in vain. Whether in years of plenty or famine, their fortunes shift unpredictably. Heaven observes, and demonic spirits bring disaster.\n\nBut those who revere true images, honor the teachings, make offerings to the homeless, dig wells to aid the multitudes, and practice the Ten Good Deeds shall gain boundless blessings. Moreover, all beings shall dwell in peace according to their natures, each reaping blessings in proportion to their good or evil. I now reveal this decree—heed it well, receive and uphold it, and do not show it to the unworthy.”\n\nThen all the great Perfected Ones, the heavenly immortals, sages, spirit kings, and the assembled multitude, hearing these teachings, rejoiced greatly. They received and vowed to follow them, bowing before the Dao before departing.\n\nThus concludes the tenth scroll of the *Supreme Middle Dao Wondrous Dharma Lotus Sutra*.",
