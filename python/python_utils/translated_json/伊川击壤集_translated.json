Yet it is not merely self-joy—it also delights in the times and in the self-contentment of the myriad things.\n\nMaster Yichuan said: Zixia once declared, “Poetry is the expression of one’s aspirations. What resides in the heart is *zhi* (aspiration); when spoken, it becomes poetry. When emotions stir within and take form in words, and sounds coalesce into patterns, we call this *yin* (music). Thus, to harbor the times is to call it *zhi*; to be moved by things is to call it *qing* (emotion). To give voice to *zhi* is to call it *yan* (speech); to elevate *qing* is to call it *sheng* (sound). When speech forms a composition, it is called poetry; when sound forms patterns, it is called music. Thereafter, by hearing one’s poetry and listening to one’s music, the *zhi* and *qing* of a person may be known.\n\nNow, emotions are seven in number, but their essence lies in two: the self and the times. As for the self, it concerns the fortunes and misfortunes of the individual; as for the times, it concerns the prosperity or decline of the age. The fortunes and misfortunes of the self extend no further than poverty or wealth, nobility or lowliness. The prosperity or decline of the times rests with the rise and fall, order and chaos of the realm.\n\nThus, when Confucius edited the *Book of Poetry*, he discarded nine-tenths of it. Of the over a thousand states of the feudal lords, only fifteen were selected for the *Airs*; of the twelve kings of the Western Zhou, only six were chosen for the *Odes*. This was because the Way of transmitting instruction lies in making clear what is good and what is evil, and only the most salient examples were preserved.\n\nIn recent times, poets, when afflicted by hardship, devote themselves to resentment and indignation; when favored with prosperity, they indulge in excess and dissipation. The fortunes and misfortunes of the self manifest in joy and anger; the prosperity or decline of the times arise from love and aversion. Rarely do they speak with the great righteousness of the world in mind. Thus, their poetry is largely submerged in personal predilections.\n\nAlas! The drowning power of emotion is greater than that of water. The ancients said that water can bear a boat, but it can also capsize it. Whether it bears or capsizes depends on the water, not on the person. When it bears, it brings benefit; when it capsizes, it brings harm. Thus, benefit and harm lie with the person, not with the water. But does the bearing or capsizing determine a person’s benefit or harm, or do benefit and harm determine the bearing or capsizing? Between the two, there must be a proper course.\n\nIt is like a person treading water: it is the person who treads the water, not the water that treads the person. Yet even those praised for their skill in treading water have never escaped being harmed by it. If one treads water for external gain, then the nature of water follows the nature of the person. If one treads water for internal gain, then the peril of ruin stands immediately before them. In such cases, what need is there to distinguish between person and water? The injury to one’s nature and the harm to one’s life are one and the same.\n\nNature is the embodiment of the Dao. If nature is injured, the Dao follows. The heart is the outer enclosure of nature. If the heart is injured, nature follows. The body is the dwelling of the heart. If the body is injured, the heart follows. Things are the vessels of the body. If things are injured, the body follows.\n\nThus, to observe nature through the Dao, the heart through nature, the body through the heart, and things through the body—this is governance. Yet even so, one has not escaped harm. It is better to observe the Dao through the Dao, nature through nature, the heart through the heart, the body through the body, and things through things. Then, even if one wished to inflict harm, how could it be achieved?\n\nIf this is so, then to observe the family through the family, the state through the state, and the world through the world—this principle may likewise be understood.\n\nFrom my youth, I devoted myself to the teachings of the Confucians, believing that the joys of the human world scarcely amounted to one ten-thousandth of what they could be, while the joys of the *mingjiao* (teachings of names and rituals) were boundless. Moreover, the joys of observing things were also boundless. Though life and death, honor and disgrace battled before me, they never entered my heart—how were they different from the four seasons, wind and flowers, snow and moon, passing before one’s eyes?\n\nTruly, this is the ability to observe things as things, so that neither harms the other. For in this state, the entanglements of emotion are entirely forgotten; the only thing not forgotten is poetry. Yet though it is said not to be forgotten, in truth, it is as if forgotten. Why? Because what I compose differs from what others compose.\n\nMy compositions know no bounds; their rhythms and meters are not [restricted]; love and aversion are not established. Thus, they do not seek fame or reputation, but respond like a mirror to a reflection, like a bell to a sound. Occasionally, in the leisure after cultivating the Dao, I observe the times in tranquility, reflect upon things in stillness, rouse my aspirations in accord with the times, lodge words in things, give voice to aspirations in song, form poetry from words, give sound to song, and create music from poetry.\n\nThus, though there is sorrow, it never wounds; though there is joy, it never indulges. Though it is said to chant and sing of emotions and nature, how could it ever burden nature and emotion?\n\nBells and drums are music; jade and silk are ritual. To be addicted to bells, drums, jade, and silk—such words cannot avoid being vulgar. Yet to abolish bells, drums, jade, and silk—what then becomes of ritual and music?\n\nSome say that the Way of the *Airs* and *Odes* flourished in antiquity but not in the present—this is hardly a comprehensive view. It is the speech of those constrained by their own circumstances.\n\nAlas! Do they not consider that those who do good in the world are few, while those who harm the good are many; that those who create peril are numerous, while those who uphold peril are few? When a man of aspiration dwells in the fields, he speaks of the fields. Thus, his poetry is named the *Yichuan Clod-Pounding Collection*.\n\nWritten on the Mid-Autumn Festival of the *bingwu* year of the *Zhiping* era of the Song Dynasty.\n\n---\n\n**Volume One of *Yichuan’s Clod-Pounding Collection***\n**Shao Yong (Yaofu) of Yichuan**\n\n**The Great Chant on Watching Chess**\n\nSome men excel in refined arts;\nI once observed them play at chess.\nBeyond the moves, I saw creation’s scheme,\nWithin each piece, the subtle shifts confess.\n\nAn endless thirst for triumph burns,\nA will to lead that never turns.\nThough seated face to face as host and guest,\nThey meet like strangers, savage and unblessed.\n\nWealth stirs the heart, its fire untamed,\nJoy, wrath—each passion plainly named.\nLife and death lie in their hands,\nGain and loss upon their lips command.\n\nHarmony shatters like ice and flame,\nNo flute and pipe their discord tame.\nNo bond of friendship here is known,\nNo love between a wife and husband shown.\n\nPearls and jade from sleeves they draw,\nDragons, serpents writhe and gnaw.\nWalls of bronze rise from the board,\nSwords and halberds clash, the air is scored.\n\nBy day they summon ghosts and gods,\nOn level ground, the dragons plod.\nEmpty rivers roar with hail and thunder,\nLand and sea see leviathans sunder.\n\nCold and heat in equal sway,\nLight and dark alternate day.\nMountains, rivers gleam like jewels bright,\nStars and spheres align in cosmic sight.\n\nWatching fortunes ebb and flow,\nI startle at the paths of weal and woe.\nHigh and low shift with ease,\nYet reversal’s grip none can appease.\n\nHeart and deed stand sundered wide,\nGain and harm cannot abide.\nFold or spread—know the hour,\nTake or leave—seize the power.\n\nThe cunning drown in their own deceit,\nThe trusting fall to blunt deceit.\nTruth and falsehood twist and blend,\nName and substance meet their end.\n\nVictory is loss’s root,\nFortune climbs on misfortune’s boot.\nHeaven and Earth in strife engage,\nFire and Water turn the page.\n\nBows and arrows clash in might,\nWords and taunts ignite the fight.\nWhat game lacks win or loss?\nWhat age escapes rise and toss?\n\nWhat once was right may now be wrong,\nWhat seems so strong may soon be gone.\nViewing past through present’s eye,\nNot just Fu Xi’s age meets the sky.\n\nYao and Shun bowed in graceful yield,\nYet Four Fiends lurked in the field.\nTang and Wu took up the blade,\nTwo Elders’ reproach did not fade.\n\nThough Gao Yao spoke with wisdom’s grace,\nYi Yin and Zhou’s counsel held their place.\nYet even then, the cure brought pain,\nMending bone while flesh was slain.\n\nBenevolence fell to fame’s deceit,\nRighteousness was crushed by gain’s deceit.\nOrder, chaos—none stand still,\nChange and reform bend to time’s will.\n\nFavor the worthy, not the son,\nYet flaw and folly still are spun.\nFavor the son, not the wise,\nAnd scions bear the wounds’ device.\n\nSome, like Miao, defied command,\nSome, like Youhu, barred the land.\nYi stirred the strife’s first spark,\nGuan and Cai spread doubt’s dark mark.\n\nThe Shang marched on Ge’s domain,\nThe Zhou struck Li’s domain.\nAt Mingtiao, banners flew,\nAt Muye, standards fell anew.\n\nThe sun that lit Xia’s prison bright\nOnce shone on Sheng’s flight.\nWho knows if moonlight’s gentle ray,\nOn Mengshi’s path did not hold sway?\n\nKing Li fled to Zhi,\nKing You died at Li.\nKing Ping moved to Luo,\nKing Nan fell at Yi.\n\nSome pledged at Shaoling’s plain,\nSome met at Huangchi’s main.\nSome fought at Chang’an’s shore,\nSome slew at Ganxi’s door.\n\nSome entered Yan and Ying,\nSome fled to Kuaiji’s ring.\nSome razed Daliang’s pride,\nSome stormed Linzi’s side.\n\nFive Hegemons devoured all,\nSeven States lashed with scornful maul.\nCruel Qin crushed the Six Lands,\nChu and Han clashed for command.\n\nHeaven ends where the sun still gleams,\nEarth fades where no bound remains.\nFar and near, all is embraced,\nLength and breadth, all is traced.\n\nFields in grids once stretched wide,\nArmor piled in endless tide.\nThen came roads to cleave the land,\nBorders drawn with ruthless hand.\n\nWeapons melted, sharp and keen,\nBooks and poems burned unseen.\nLords dismissed, prefects installed,\nTrunk strengthened, branches maimed and galled.\n\nHeavy troops garrisoned Shang,\nThe Great Wall choked the frontier’s song.\nThey boasted of their rock-like might,\nA reign to last through endless night.\n\nYet with a flick of fate’s own hand,\nThey ceded land where they did stand.\nViewed men as ants in scornful gaze,\nSpent wealth like sand in reckless haze.\n\nE’pang Palace stood unfinished still,\nThe First Emperor’s cart reached Xi.\nBefore the tomb’s last stone was laid,\nChen She’s troops rose from Qi’s glade.\n\nAt Ba Shang, hearts ran deep,\nAt Hong Gate, tempers seethe.\nXianyang’s smoke rose to the sky,\nNanzheng’s flames burned on high.\n\nMen and ghosts in chaos twined,\nWind and clouds in sorrow joined.\nXiang’s might, Liu’s strength yet vied,\nWho would claim the deer denied?\n\nThree Chapters’ law stood fast,\nFive States’ troops followed at last.\nTemple schemes weighed deep and wise,\nTent-bound plans won swift surprise.\n\nAt Guangwu, rage burned bright,\nAt Honggou, beasts fought in fright.\nXingyang mourned Ji Xin’s ruse,\nGaixia bid Yu Ji adieu.\n\nThree Heroes’ talents then took flight,\nA thousand years shone with new light.\nOld rivers kept their storied grace,\nNew sun and moon lit heaven’s face.\n\nThree Systems’ calendar aligned,\nChariots and script in one design.\nNo lands were sundered, far or wide,\nThe distant held in bonds of pride.\n\nYet royal kin vied for the throne,\nArmies split to North and South alone.\nHad no great ministers stood tall,\nWho then could save the empire’s fall?\n\nA century passed in fleeting sun,\nLong wars shook the vaulted one.\nWho knew the witchcraft’s dark design,\nWould rise from Liu Qu’s tangled line?\n\nThe steward held the scales with care,\nBright and clear, he met despair.\nSeeing peril, he gave his life,\nNo shame to the orphan’s strife.\n\nBandits mocked the orphan’s plight,\nActing like fox and raccoon in night.\nPalace halls saw widows weep,\nThrone rooms chased the infant deep.\n\nDragon wars—where did they lead?\nIce stood firm in time of need.\nThough the dike may break and flood,\nWho dares forget the dike’s true good?\n\nEastern Han saw dawn’s last glow,\nAt Kunyang, tiles flew in the blow.\nWang Mang’s ghost in sorrow sighed,\nOn Jiantai’s steps, corpses piled.\n\nAt Hao, they chased the high-nosed king,\nAt Xin’an, Red Eyebrows’ sting.\nFire’s virtue ruled once more,\nHan’s court restored its ancient lore.\n\nDou and Deng rose from the hearth,\nYan and Liang grasped the hen’s worth.\nWhat use were Jing’s labors vast,\nWhen Dong’s deeds left all aghast?\n\nYellow River ran with scarce a flame,\nThe capital choked with thistle and bramble.\nLong skies saw crows take flight,\nWhite bones drew no pity’s light.\n\nMoats cried out to be refilled,\nNo blood left for the sheep to yield.\nA great house nears its fall,\nNo single beam can prop it all.\n\nMengde struck first with daring hand,\nZhongmou rode his father’s land.\nXuande’s ambition met no end,\nYet tears were all he could expend.\n\nWestern Jin prized empty talk,\nGreat plans hung on rank and mark.\nWomen held the reins of state,\nKin turned to plague and hate.\n\nTwo Lords bore frost and dew,\nFive Hu defiled the sacred vessel true.\nNo Guan Yiwu stood in sight,\nMen longed for Xian Huan’s might.\n\nOn broad roads, Qiang dust swarms,\nIn the Central Plains, Hu horses scream.\nDragon’s light pierces Ox and Dipper,\nSun’s shadow sheds like a rainbow’s molt.\n\nClearing grass, they came to Luo’s bend,\nReclaiming fields, they rushed to Jiang’s shore.\nTwo hundred and four years passed,\nThen chariots raced abreast in stride.\n\nEastern Jin split its southern tail,\nAt times yielding sacred lingzhi.\nFive times the mandate changed hands,\nTill Chen at last flourished under Sui.\n\nNations shattered in autumn’s dusk,\nCities lay waste with spring’s lush weeds.\nThe Yangtze stretched empty to the eye,\nTravelers’ tears soaked their robes.\n\nLater Wei opened its northern gate,\nXiaowen nearly stitched peace’s seams.\nYet Heyin soon saw upheaval,\nThe realm split east and west.\n\nErzhu rose with Gao’s might,\nYuwen wiped out Northern Qi.\nWhen Sui at last merged with Chen,\nThe four seas became mere hedges.\n\nThe Bian Canal drained public and private stores,\nLiao campaigns left soldiers weary.\nEvery body knew weariness,\nEvery mouth sighed in lament.\n\nEverywhere, eras bore new names,\nAll longed for chaos to depart.\nThe Central Plains lacked a lord,\nWho could discern deer from elk?\n\nIn times hard as \"one in a thousand,\"\nHeaven and man set their tryst.\nWhen dragons soar, clouds gather,\nWhen tigers stride, winds keen.\n\nThe empress wielded the sun’s power,\nHer kin held sway in the palace’s depths.\nAlas for Huan Yanfan,\nWho spared Wu Sansi’s life.\n\nXiuling’s hills rang with song and dance,\nYuyang’s drums and war drums stirred.\nCould peace be scorned so lightly?\nYet blame fell on one Yang Guifei.\n\nSword Pavilion scraped the sky,\nTong Pass leaked tigers’ forms.\nBoth capitals fell to ruin,\nThe nine ancestral temples toppled.\n\nJoy’s peak brings sorrow’s fall,\nFavor’s bond breeds harm’s betrayal.\nMatters left no recourse,\nWho could compare such woe?\n\nFrom then on, regional lords thrived,\nNo subjects showed their sovereign reverence.\nRelying on merit, they shunned court,\nCiting bandit suppression as pretext.\n\nEach amassed mighty troops,\nWho pitied the court’s decline?\nThey extorted the throne’s indulgence,\nWatching the altars’ fate.\n\nSeizing lands without royal decree,\nPlundering to fatten themselves.\nThe imperial carriage fled in disarray,\nEscorts faltered in disarray.\n\nA tail too large knows no easy sway,\nA whip too long cannot command.\nLong-nurtured treachery brings certain woe,\nRaising tigers courts lasting harm.\n\nThe nation’s steps grew ever more frail,\nThe lord’s heart filled with vain regret.\nWhen fortune comes, flowers bloom bright,\nWhen power wanes, leaves scatter wide.\n\nTen clans divided the Central Plains,\nFive houses took turns on the thoroughfare.\nVainly bright stars still gleamed,\nYet dawn in the east had not broken.\n\nHardly had they returned to Changlu Garrison,\nWhen they were driven to Huli Marsh.\nJiangxiao’s troops took what they sought,\nXuanwu’s fire burned in folly.\n\nSurrender at Zhongdu was blameworthy,\nDeath at Lecheng was laughable.\nTaiyuan’s court saw morning entrants,\nLiu Zi heard evening wails.\n\nAffairs bore layer upon layer of strife,\nHuman hearts shifted with each turn.\nCold ashes hid embers within,\nRotten bones still claimed turtle’s fame.\n\nDeceit and cunning thrived in shadows,\nHardship and sorrow clung to the self.\nTo guard against harm, skin and flesh heal fast,\nYet saving the heart’s core comes too late.\n\nDisaster strikes before one turns,\nWords wound like gnawing at the navel.\nTo rise is to fall,\nTo near collapse is to be propped up.\n\nDizzied, all men revile,\nIn peace, all the world yearns.\nOnly by curing grave illness\nCan one be called a good physician.\n\nLong-neglected fields lie barren,\nTreacherous paths are hard to tread.\nWithout a true lord’s emergence,\nHow can deeds be done?\n\nHouse and state spun to their limits,\nLord and minister met but rarely.\nHeaven lent its hand,\nAnd our Song thus laid its foundation.\n\nWise plans adapted to each circumstance,\nHeroes raised their heads in submission.\nTo this day, over a hundred years on,\nPeople know not war or weapons.\n\nSuccess and failure must bow to fate,\nRise and fall hinge on the times.\nHeaven’s mechanisms shift without cease,\nMaster strategists vary their plays.\n\nPast events are but faded traces,\nYet earlier records may serve as guides.\nCompared to the game of weiqi,\nThey differ not by a hair’s breadth.\n\nWaxing and waning follow heaven’s turn,\nYin and yang keep to the Dao’s bounds.\nFortune and misfortune shift with men,\nMovement and stillness pivot on the hinge.\n\nThose who rush will stumble first,\nLate bloomers wither last.\nBetter to forget both harm and gain,\nThan to suffer their exchange.\n\nTo catch fish, one needs a fish trap,\nTo snare rabbits, a snare.\nYet clinging to the catch,\nOne becomes a sheep in tiger’s guise.\n\nThe Dao is vast—hear Laozi’s words,\nTalent is rare—hear Confucius’s.\nTo grasp form is to awaken,\nHow can one fear delusion in the game?\n\nBlack and white cannot be sullied,\nLife and death are not to be sighed over.\nStriking the mark like a shattered target,\nThe blade meets no resistance.\n\nDo not marvel at others’ scorn,\nNor fear cold eyes’ scrutiny.\nHaving mastered wondrous use,\nWhy fret over many paths?\n\nFollowing the Dao, the Dao is gained,\nAligning with heaven, heaven does not oppose.\nExhausting principle to fulfill nature,\nSpeaking freely to dispel words.\n\nGazing outward, one knows simplicity,\nListening to echoes, one discerns the rare.\nGreat broth needs no seasoning,\nDark wine cannot be diluted.\n\nSupreme soldiers cannot be attacked,\nClever calendars cannot be calculated.\nWise words cannot be spoken,\nFleeting chariots cannot be pursued.\n\nBrothers excel in love,\nFather and son in kindness.\nThe realm may also be entrusted,\nBut this move must not be hoarded.\n\n*To Guo Wen of Gong County, Written in the First Year of Huangyou*\nSoft winds on Jade Creek bear drunken steeds,\nFlowers bind Stone Grotto, song-boats sway.\nThough near enough to see, immortal and mortal part,\nI cannot join your third-month wanderings.\n\n*On Presenting My New Residence to Palace Attendant Liu Junyu*\nSouth of Lǚdao Lane, bamboo paths stretch long,\nGreen willows shade waters that part and flow.\nAll the worthy have bought scenes of serene heart,\nI alone dwell here to nurture autumn’s resolve.\n\nCompared to Chen’s gate, I’ve overstepped,\nYet beside Yan’s alley, I may still fret.\nThough winds and rains rage without cause,\nI trust they cannot overwhelm Shen Yin’s reclusion.\n\n*Sent to Prefect Han Zihua of the Three Cities*\nLuoyang has been a capital\nFor over two thousand years.\nEach step treads through maps and records,\nEach glance spans past and present.\n\nNorthwest, palaces stand tall,\nSoutheast, mountains and rivers lean.\nThe Yi and Luo rivers mirror men’s clarity,\nBefore the gates, Song and Shaoshi loom cold.\n\nThe finest waters and bamboos lie\nSouth of Lǚdao Lane.\nBelow stands the hermit’s chamber,\nA single path leads to the wicker gate.\n\nWeeds hide his dwelling,\nPigweed seasons his meals.\nHe serves his parents above, his wife and children below,\nThick or thin, as fate allows.\n\nThough others cannot bear such cares,\nHe himself does not change his ease.\n\nI perused histories and grasped the rise and fall of states,\nDelved into classics to find their root and source.\nA guest then said to me: \"Why do you alone refuse to grasp the moment?\nThe pure court now employs talent,\nThe sagely lord seeks worthies in earnest.\nDao and virtue, benevolence and righteousness—\nThese are no mere empty words.\nMerit and achievement prize timeliness;\nWhy not seek a fine office?\nAbove, you would eat the Son of Heaven’s salary,\nBelow, succor the remnant of the common folk.\nOn thoroughfares, you would raise grand mansions,\nBeyond the city walls, broad fertile fields.\nCrimson gates ablaze with gold and purple,\nGreen towers thick with pipes and strings.\nIn your outer stables, fat and noble steeds stand arrayed,\nIn your rear chambers, delicate beauties gather.\nEntering, you sit in a lofty hall;\nExiting, you ride in a splendid carriage.\nHow resplendent your cap and sword,\nHow composed your bearing and ease.\nYou would discourse on the affairs of the realm,\nIn a vast assembly, your words would kindle bright mist.\nNone would dare lift their gaze to you,\nAll would hold their breath, awaiting your countenance.\nThis is what is called a true man—\nHis ambition may be seen and known.\nWhy then must you afflict yourself,\nYour form and visage like a withered eel?\nYou trace the deeds of the ancients,\nGleaning from the volumes they left behind,\nYet before a single ditch of water you linger,\nEnamored of a few stalks of bamboo.\nThis is what is called a common fellow—\nWhat lofty integrity is there to aspire to?\"\n\nI dared reply to my guest:\n\"Affairs are not so easily explained.\nIt is not that I delight in ragged hemp,\nNor that my mouth loathes rare delicacies.\nHow could I not know the gourd’s worth,\nYet firmly decline to grasp the whip?\nI fear only the sight of gaping jaws,\nDare I forget the adornment of garden and hill?\nDeepest depths hold layered waves,\nLoftiest heights hold layered peaks.\nTread them as level ground—\nThis is no hardship for men.\nPoverty and low station are what men find bitter,\nWealth and honor are what men find shifting.\nTo dwell in them as though they were nothing—\nThis is truly what men find difficult.\nAdvancing, I follow my own Dao;\nRetreating, I nurture my own wholeness.\nSince I do not yet know how it would be in another’s place,\nHow could I not remain steadfast?\nI dare say your counsel\nHolds nothing I might adopt.\n\nO, how splendid the jade!\nBorn in the hills of Jing.\nThough He the Carver may have known its worth,\nThe state of Chu did not concur.\nThe Way’s rise and fall, its bending and stretching,\nAdvance and retreat, its timing and precedence—\nIf one does not follow this principle,\nWhen the jade is shattered, whose fault is it?\nIf the Dao remains unfulfilled,\nIts mandate lies with Heaven.\n\nOf late, I wandered through the Three Cities,\nLingering still in hesitation.\nThe renowned ministers of this age\nDeigned to extend me special courtesy.\nSome, in the clear night, discoursed on the Dao;\nOthers, by the rear pond, set boats adrift.\nFor several evenings, gatherings of literature and wine—\nBoundless was the joy.\nBeyond the cold of the tenth month,\nBefore the myriad leaves under hoarfrost,\nI returned to my walled dwelling,\nTo sleep drunk beneath the bamboo window in the bright sun.\n\nI raise my gaze in thanks to the gentleman’s understanding,\nAnd at his behest, compose this piece.\n\n*Matching Rhymes with Zhang Yuanbo, Bureau Director, at the End of the Year in Jiayou 1*\nAt forty-six, I am old,\nAshamed to lack talent.\nThe last days of the year just turn auspicious,\nThe new spring again stirs the ashes.\nNot only have I forgotten profit and salary,\nBut I have also cast off the body’s form.\nWhite hairs already exceed half,\nTime hurries on of its own accord.\n\n*Thanking Prefect Wang Mixue of Yanzhou for His Gift of Wine*\nA grand prefecture brings new wine,\nA dense small garden blooms with fine flowers.\nOn what day shall I drink beneath the crimson trees,\nStartled to find it ill-suited to a rustic’s home?\n\n*Encountering Spring in the Small Garden*\nA hundred flowers hide in the small reclusive garden,\nEach following red and purple to sprout new buds.\nThe Lord of the East lends the power of yang’s warmth—\nNo less than the rich and noble houses of dukes and marquises.\n\n*Matching Rhymes with the Two Young Ministers Zhang on White Chrysanthemums*\nPale and pure, dawn congeals frost,\nFitting to follow autumn’s close.\nKnowing myself to be pure and white,\nWho pities my solitary fragrance?\nNot that jade lacks luster,\nBut rather startled that snow bears scent.\nWhite blossoms float in jade liquid,\nOne hue blends with the jeweled cups.\n\n*On the Birth of My Son in Jiayou 2*\nNow at forty-five years of age,\nI have only just become a father.\nNurturing and teaching are truly my duty,\nBut whether you live long or die young, whether wise or foolish, rests with you.\nIf I live to seventy,\nI will see you at twenty-five before my eyes.\nI wish for you to become a great worthy—\nI know not whether Heaven will consent.\n\n*Four Idle Chants*\n1.\nAll my life like an official,\nI have followed my lot amid wind and waves.\nWhat is lost knows no limit,\nWhat is gained—how much can it be?\nSince I have strayed from concerns of governing the world,\nI may yet preserve Heaven’s harmony.\nWhen there is wine in the cup,\nI drink and sing again.\n\n2.\nAt forty-five, I have just begun to know the path of fate.\nWho would have thought Heaven would not cut me off,\nThat I would become a father only now?\nI set aside zither and books,\nDare I hope for a grand household?\nAll things are thus—\nWhy trouble myself with needless worry and fear?\n\n3.\nLiving in Luoyang for eight or nine years,\nMy heart has been troubled by only two or three things.\nWe meet, each with white hair,\nSitting together, much is said in pure discourse.\nHuman affairs have long been silently settled,\nWorldly sentiments I have long known.\nWhen wine is poured, do not press me—\nLet me slowly reach the point of tipsy delight.\n\n4.\nI wish for the joy of a single gourd,\nYet I have not even two *qing* of fields.\nMy sincere devotion has not pierced the sun,\nBut white hairs already adorn my temples.\nThe clouds’ mood grows colder and more distant,\nThe pine’s heart grows older and firmer.\nIn recent years, I have grown ever more indolent,\nOften recalling the old forests and springs.\n\n*Matching Rhymes with Young Minister Zhang on Returning to Heyang*\nOnce I was a guest in the springtime of youth,\nToday I return as a hoary old man.\nToday and that day are already a lifetime apart—\nHow much rise and fall lies within?\n\n*Eight Poems on Tall Bamboos*\n1.\nOver a hundred stalks of tall bamboo,\nI know they were surely grown for me.\nSuddenly, I find something gained,\nOften I stroll idly around them.\nI trust myself, yet perhaps I have not attained;\nI know myself, yet perhaps I am not clear.\nSecretly comparing myself to the ancients,\nI cannot help but feel shame.\n\n2.\nTall bamboos stand by the clear ditch,\nThe pavilion is small, yet also secluded.\nThough the season belongs to summer,\nThe wind and dew already foretell autumn’s chill.\nMoonlight emerges from the forest,\nThe sound of springs flows beneath the steps.\nWho knows the feeling of this night?\nVast and distant, it cannot be gathered in.\n\n3.\nTall bamboos are already lovely,\nHow much more so beneath the drooping willows?\nThe recluse has no carriages or caps of office,\nYet attaining this, he may well marvel.\nSince I cannot stoop even an inch,\nWhy should I seal my sack in apology?\nIf Jia Yi had known this,\nHis bitter weeping would have ceased.\n\n4.\nTall bamboos lean together in green,\nNaturally emitting their lingering purity.\nFrom time to time, a gentle breeze comes,\nTen thousand leaves sound as one.\nThe Dao, though sullied, attains the principle of leveling,\nThings, though hollow, contain distant feeling.\nWalking alongside my idle companion,\nHow clear and peaceful our thoughts.\n\n5.\nTall bamboos like green banners,\nEmerald willows like low-hanging canopies.\n\nThe recluse has his couch and carriage,\nDay and night he faces them.\nIn the stillness of his dwelling, he feels his spirit open,\nIn the leisure of the scene, he delights in true communion.\nRather than lose my true nature,\nHow much better to follow what I love.\nTall bamboos mingle with towering parasols,\nStartling the first signs of autumn’s season.\nThe evening cool is especially delightful,\nOld scrolls are fit to unfurl.\nPavilions and ponds are wrapped in gentle breezes,\nGardens and groves linger in the late light.\nIf life holds such joy,\nWhy quibble over trifles?\n\nTall bamboos rise some ten feet high,\nStill above the loftiest blossoms.\nThe brushwood gate stays shut by day,\nGreen and emerald face each other all the while.\nNot only is the body at ease,\nThe heart, too, is level and vast.\nTo know the joy of idleness,\nIs itself to rival lords and ministers.\n\nTall bamboos stay green through winter,\nOnly in the fourth month do they shed their leaves.\nSprouting like the stilling of weapons,\nShedding sheaths like the doffing of armor.\nTheir slender stillness is truly lovely,\nCircling them, one loses count of the turns.\nAlas, the common grasses and trees,\nWaste their time beneath hoe and spade.\n\n*End of the First Scroll of Yichuan’s Jirang Collection*\n*Beginning of the Second Scroll of Yichuan’s Jirang Collection*\n*Yichuan Shao Yong Yaofu*\n\n**Drinking in Autumn at the Song Garden in Zhengzhou, Presented to Zhou Zhengshu, Registrar of Guancheng**\n\nTwo capitals stand four hundred li apart,\nBetween them lies a famed garden, the Song family’s domain.\nAncient trees pierce the sky like swords and halberds,\nLong vines trail to earth like coiling dragons and serpents.\nI arrive on a day late in autumn’s close,\nYou set the feast before me beneath twilight blossoms.\nThe rain has passed, the bamboo pavilion still damp as we part,\nAt dawn’s return, crows rise from the road home.\n\n---\n\n**Revisiting Gongcheng and Baiyuan’s Old Residence on the Double Ninth**\n\nIn my homeland, the festive day arrives,\nYet climbing high, I find only sorrow.\nMountains and rivers lie beyond a dream,\nWind and moon span a decade’s span.\nWhite hairs now streak my temples,\nYellow chrysanthemums twine the old fence.\nMy countrymen must laugh at me—\nA man who brocades his robes, yet fails as a son.\n\n---\n\n**Passing Through Shaan in the Third Year of Jiayou**\n\nWhat radiance did my ancestor’s Dao possess?\nThe *Two Nans* divided, bestowing one region.\nHe aided Zhou as Grand Protector,\nEnfeoffed in Shaan to assist King Cheng.\nYears stretch distant, boundless,\nMountains and rivers grow faint, vast.\nThough his descendant proves unworthy,\nStill I recall the sweet pear tree.\n\n---\n\n**Inscribed on the Yellow River**\n\nWho says its benefits outweigh its harms?\nI say its turbid flow has never cleared.\nFrom Kunlun in the west to the sea in the east,\nHow many voices cry out in grievance?\n\n---\n\n**Passing Through Tong Pass**\n\nBarriers tighten in times of disorder,\nYet stand idle in peace.\nThough mountains and rivers form natural defenses,\nCan virtue and power ever be contested?\nFailing to fathom the thousand-in-one truth,\nIts \"hundred-and-two\" fame rings hollow.\nDistant lands long since ceased to be foreign—\nWhy still rely on the crowing of roosters?\n\n---\n\n**Inscribed on Mount Hua**\n\nAmong the Five Peaks within the realm,\nThe state reveres their seasonal rites.\nMount Hua stands as one,\nA mighty guardian of the western frontier.\nThe Tang called it the Golden Heavenly King,\nNow it is sealed as the Compliant Sage Emperor.\nAlas! Such a spirit,\nUsurps the place of heaven and earth.\n\n---\n\n**Staying at the Huaqing Palace**\n\nIn the sixth year of Tianbao’s reign,\nA palace was built by the warm springs.\nThe Radiant Emperor and his consort\nCame here yearly thereafter.\nPurple pavilions wrapped in cool winds,\nTowering peaks beneath the bright moon.\nYet why do the twin stone urns\nStill trickle fragrant streams?\n\n---\n\n**Ascending the Chaoyuan Pavilion**\n\nEmbroidered Ridge rises in layered peaks,\nNineteen winding turns climb steep and high.\nAfter a light rain, all is mist,\nEmerging faintly from the clouds.\nThe golden carriage’s past is distant,\nThe jade statue’s traces remain, broken.\nEven now, by the Wei River’s banks,\nThe sight of Chang’an endures.\n\n---\n\n**Composed on the Road to Chang’an**\n\nWhy weep on the road to Chang’an?\nThe ancients traveled it, as do men today.\nUnheeding of cold or heat, dawn or dusk,\nWheels and hooves clatter endlessly.\nThis land, too, knows hardship—\nRain turns to mud, wind to dust.\nMud and dust shift without number,\nIn great storms, none dare venture out.\n\n---\n\n**Inscribed at the Temple of the Marquis of Liu**\n\nToppling Xiang, enthroning Liu—easy as turning a hand,\nEnding Qin, restoring Han—like resetting a board.\nHe rolled and unfurled the realm with a day’s planning,\nForged his heart’s source in grain-abstaining seclusion.\nAll Yellow Stone’s teachings were put to use,\nYet what need had he for Red Pine’s company?\nFor talent and achievement like his,\nNone through the ages can compare.\n\n---\n\n**Ten Poems Inscribed at the Temple of the Marquis of Huaiyin**\n\n**I**\nA single man’s rebellion deserved execution,\nThe slaughter of three clans seemed merciless.\nThe Han’s Dao then was half-hegemonic,\nXiao He’s kingly counsel lacked true honor.\nTo establish such great merit was no folly,\nYet craving a princedom reeked of greed.\nFour hundred years of Han’s flame were secured,\nOnly to be slain once peace was won.\n\n**II**\nHaving found a true lord in life,\nWhy feign kingship to accomplish deeds?\nWho says misfortune began here?\nOne should not turn to resent the High Emperor.\n\n**III**\nFor a time, Han Xin was a loyal hound,\nFor ages, Xiao He a hegemonic minister.\nBoth transgressed the bounds of proper conduct,\nYet their crimes fell short of such a man.\n\n**IV**\nHan Xin never rebelled against Liu,\nYet Xiao He’s suspicions of Han ran deep.\nHad he heeded Kuai Tong’s words then,\nThe High Ancestor’s fame might have been undone.\n\n**V**\nThough endowed with talent and wisdom,\nHis survival and retreat were not sincere.\nThe Five Lakes’ misty waves remain,\nYet none follow Fan Li’s footsteps.\n\n**VI**\nHad Han Xin not existed, Xiang could not have been destroyed,\nWithout Xiao He, Han could not have been restrained.\nKnow this: the realm cannot be ruled single-handedly—\nWithout the High Ancestor, Xiao would have struggled.\n\n**VII**\nThe Han’s foundation was laid by debating merit,\nFive men of other surnames were enfeoffed as kings.\nNone matched the might of Huaiyin,\nWho dared to root out the Qin’s resurgence.\n\n**VIII**\nHan Xin relied on merit, foresaw little,\nThe Han emperor owed him virtue yet clung to power.\nTo imprison and execute him was no great feat,\nYet such cruelty was needless.\n\n**IX**\nIf glory is seized violently, so too is humiliation,\nAfter much joy, sorrow must follow.\nHad he relinquished his princedom after success,\nHe would have remained a lord for generations.\n\n---\n\n**Inscribed on the Prefectural Tower of Fengzhou**\n\nWillows trail green sashes,\nTheir leaves stirred like flying canopies.\nThe perilous tower’s thoughts are endless,\nAll day I face it in idle repose.\nCrows depart, the grove empties,\nClouds drift, the mountains remain unobstructed.\nMy feelings follow the paired swallows home,\nMy intent meets the lone goose’s flight.\nThe evening bugle sounds, now faint, now clear,\nLayered cliffs shift between light and shadow.\nThe setting sun hangs in sparse crimson,\nDistant waters ripple with gentle currents.\nThe frontier’s gaze is thick with misty peaks,\nThe capital lies as if beyond the heavens.\nWhy does my heart, long a stranger,\nLean eastward, clinging to the railing in anguish?\n\n---\n\n**From Fengzhou Back to the Qinchuan Post Station, Sent to Vice-Prefects Xue and Yao**\n\nNinety days of joyous gathering,\nNow turned to a dream at a glance.\nThe bright moon and clear river—\nOnce more, the eastern pavilion is beyond sharing.\n\n---\n\n**To Zhang Yuanbo of the Western Terrace, Who Sent a Poem in the Snow**\n\nSnowflakes in Luoyang, large as hands,\nNo fire in the brazier, no wine in the cup.\nAt dawn’s first light, a knock at the door—\nA poem from the Western Terrace, delivered through the snow.\n\n---\n\n**Seeing Off Zhang, Registrar of Yishi**\n\nA thousand *li* of official travel in this world,\nTwo layers of parting from parents at home.\nRemember now: the roc’s flight begins here,\nThe road ahead is perilous—seek favor wisely.\n\n---\n\n**New Year’s Chant, Fifth Year of Jiayou**\n\nQu Yuan knew his errors with age,\nConfucius read the *Yi* through the years.\nHuman feelings end here,\nBut heaven’s intent is not in vain.\nAffairs weary me more each day,\nYet my longing for the mountains grows ever firmer.\nWho shares this resolve?\nTo grow old together by the Yi River.\n\n---\n\n**Five Spring Excursions**\n\n**I**\nPlum blossoms on the Five Ridges welcome the year’s end,\nIn the third river valley, the first month brings cold plum’s praise.\nTen thousand *li* apart, yet a month ahead—\nNow I know spring’s colors come from the south.\n\n**From the Five Spring Excursions (continued)**\n\n**II**\nWhose masterful tune flows from the Qiang flute?\nAll day, its pure fragrance lingers in the winecup.\nI imagine the wanderer far from home,\nStanding here too, lost in lingering steps.\n\n**III**\nThe spring hues of Luoyang stretch boundless,\nAnd east of the city, they grow yet more splendid.\nA gentle breeze sways a thousand willows,\nSoft ripples stir half the river’s blossoms.\nIn misty clarity, kingfishers glide over level banks;\nIn warming sun, mandarin ducks descend on shallow sands.\nLong have I not seen the sovereign’s western journey—\nNow travelers only sigh at their temples’ silvered frost.\n\n**IV**\nThe second month blooms in full radiance,\nYet the imperial banners have not come—spring drifts unmoored.\nBeneath green willows, I wander through every fragrant path;\nAmid red apricots, I return half-drunk with wine.\nA few fallen petals lure butterflies in chase;\nA slanting sunbeam hears the orioles’ song.\nWith clear cups and wine, my aged parents rejoice—\nStill, I may don motley robes and play before their steps.\n\n**V**\nThe finest festival under heaven is Cold Food Day,\nAnd the world’s most famed gardens lie in Luoyang.\nJingu’s warmth blends with palace halls’ emerald,\nBronze Camels gleam beneath silken radiance.\nBy the bridge, willows trail their slender threads to earth;\nBeyond the flowers, swings rise halfway up the walls.\nWhite horses tread lightly on grass like shears—\nFor over a decade, I’ve roamed here in delight.\n\n**VI**\nIn the third month, peonies burst into full bloom,\nAnd drumbeats rise wherever pavilions stand.\nLaughing girls in carriages exchange banter;\nBelow the towers, crowds drift by at leisure.\nRippling jade-green waves sway the curtains,\nWhile Shangyang’s floral breath fills the wine vessels.\nThis is the climate the Western Capital favors—\nYet now, who mourns the barren trees’ vain allure?\n\n---\n\n**Awakening in the Bamboo Courtyard**\nAwakening in the bamboo courtyard, I recline on the armrest,\nAs the languid summer day stretches long.\nOrioles just lead their fledglings, teaching tender tongues;\nApricots hang heavy, donning their pale gold.\nRaindrops break the quiet dream in fragments,\nWhile wind stirs distant thoughts into flight.\nA small channel plays with water in dense green shade—\nLooking back, I realize days have passed once more.\n\n---\n\n**Six Autumn Excursions**\n\n**I**\nIn the seventh month, lotuses blaze in full bloom,\nAnd I linger near the southeastern garden.\nSometimes the wind brushes the pond’s heart,\nBearing boundless fragrance from the water’s surface.\nMist-painted streams run deep—I wander lost;\nThe evening lake at Dongting has not yet brought me home.\nThen, a sudden shower whispers past—\nAnd fresh coolness arrives with my wine.\n\n**II**\nBefore autumn, the vast clarity stirs in secret,\nAnd Luoyi now knows the season’s balance.\nCourtyards turn cool—people rejoice together;\nGardens, washed by rain, grow even clearer.\nTurning the boat on Yi River, the breeze drifts gently;\nReining the horse at Tianjin Bridge, the moon shines bright.\nThe sages’ thoughts divide like Gao and Kui—\nLet poetry and wine celebrate this peaceful age.\n\n**III**\nThe eighth month’s light is not yet bleak,\nAnd pine pavilions, bamboo groves suit it best.\nJust as day and night find their pause,\nThe balance of heat and chill arrives in due time.\nThe bright moon enters my heart as if with intent;\nA kindly breeze meets my face as if it knows me.\nIdle folk sing and chant in contentment,\nUnconcerned whether the court heeds their verse.\n\n**IV**\nMy home lies south of the city by water and bamboo,\nAnd autumn’s joys have never failed me.\nI love the mild chill of this season,\nWhile half-drunk, time slips by unnoticed.\nTrusting my horse on the imperial avenue after light rain,\nLeaning on the railing of a monk’s pavilion at dusk.\nFor ten years, I’ve chased every fair scene—\nNow, I ask the wind to whiten my temples.\n\n**V**\nThough the ninth month’s splendor wanes,\nThe Central Plain’s beauty is not yet spent.\nMy eyes take in autumn’s hues for a thousand *li*;\nMy hands hold two or three branches of yellow blossoms.\nFine wine easily dissolves idle years,\nBut bronze mirrors need not reflect my aging face.\nIf I must make others believe,\nWho would know the sincerity I’ve poured out?\n\n**VI**\nIn frosty skies, endless thoughts arise—\nI cannot bear the tower’s height, forcing my gaze.\nDistant mountains fill my sight in vain;\nThe autumn palace stands empty and aloof.\nClouds stretch over far peaks, a thousand *xun* straight;\nSunset scatters crimson threads through the sky.\nCountless sorrows cannot be spoken—\nWith whom can I open my heart to the west wind?\n\n---\n\n**An Autumn Day’s Occurrences**\nCrows clamor in the daytime woods—\nFor whom do they toil so bitterly?\nCrickets chirp through the nighttime courtyard—\nFor whom do they labor so ceaselessly?\nAlas, how brief their lives,\nYet they never rest.\nI ask: how long is this?\nThe two who forget speech and silence.\n\n---\n\n**On the Road to Mount Shang**\nTen lodgings bring me to Shangyan,\nThough distant, the journey is not harsh.\nEast and west, I trace the Luo River,\nGazing at Qin’s mountains within and beyond.\nBeyond the mist and rosy clouds, I am free—\nYet my heart remains with my parents.\nThe courtyard is not far—\nI can set a date for my return.\n\n---\n\n**Matching Magistrate Zhang Zihou’s Early Plum Blossoms**\nOnly the Queen Mother of the West could craft such lightness,\nSnipping the sky’s edge into scattered white clouds.\nEndless pure fragrance and pristine beauty—\nEven the fairest offerings at the winecup yield to you.\n\nPlums shade the spring stream, water winds around the hills,\nPlum blossoms dazzle as the brook murmurs.\nIn Nanzheng, the earth is warm, and they bloom early—\nBy the start of spring, they’ve already bloomed many times.\n\nA thousand flowers vie in succession,\nBut if one speaks of lofty standards, only the plum remains.\nI understand your intent in binding them—\nYou cherish their pure threads, letting them bloom first.\n\nFrost upholds their noble bearing, lifting it high;\nWind carries their cold fragrance far and wide.\nThe prefect is moved, the traveler is touched—\nGolden cups are drained in celebration.\n\n---\n\n**On the Road in Shang Mountains**\nFading embers, dim lamp, the night deepens,\nAs I silently ponder past affairs, wrapped in a cold quilt.\nA frosty sky, a bright moon—though a thousand *li* apart,\nIt cannot compare to the inch of heart grieving for the times.\n\n---\n\n**Matching Prefect Song of Shang’s Early Plum Blossoms**\nSouth of the mountains, the land is as warm as Lingnan,\nAnd in the twelfth month, plum blossoms have already bloomed for days.\nUnbending, they defy the common flowers’ ways,\nStanding apart from the crowd, claiming spring’s first light.\n\nFrom the horn, their notes drift, colder than bone;\nFrom the flute, their melody enters the spirit.\nA fair brow’s makeup fades, clinging to pale powder;\nA painted beam’s warmth stirs light dust.\nThe magistrate cherishes their beauty, offering them to the prefect;\nThe prefect shares their fragrance even with rustics.\nHolding a few branches, I inhale deeply—\nHow can I bear to let fine wine touch my lips?\n\n---\n\n**Matching a Friend’s Poem on Freeing the Heart**\nThough one may not foresee the future,\nWealth and rank, fame and achievement—are they truly won by force?\nTo cleanse the heart, nothing serves like wine;\nTo roam in ease, nothing compares to poetry.\nHere, amidst water, bamboo, clouds, and mountains,\nHow can I betray the seasons of wind, flowers, snow, and moon?\nA man’s grand ambitions lie in action or retreat—\nWhen, if not now, should I unknit my brows and smile?\n\n---\n\n**Matching Prefect of Shang’s Poem on Ascending the Tower to View Snow**\n\n**Matching Prefect of Shang’s Poem on Ascending the Tower to View Snow**\n\nAt the western tower, the snow sharpens my gaze,\nMy body, step by step, seems encased in crystal.\nA thousand flakes, ten thousand flakes, artfully adorn the earth,\nHalf-dancing, half-flying, they slant against the pillars.\nTheir form like jade shards—fragile yet scattered,\nTheir substance like willow catkins—even lighter still.\nWho says the wanderer at the world’s edge is bound?\nWith wine before us, our hearts hold twofold feeling.\n\n---\n\n**Matching Prefect of Shang’s Poem on the Western Tower After Snow Clears**\n\nThe great snow first clears as the sun dips low,\nWhy spare the climb? I ascend the high tower again.\nA few peaks stand like swords unsheathed,\nA single stream winds in fresh threads of ice.\nThe Kunlun’s heights, transplanted, are all jade,\nThe Milky Way, fallen, turns to silver.\nThe reclusive man regrets his lack of fine lines—\nYet the scene has never failed to favor men.\n\n---\n\n**Matching Prefect of Shang’s Poem on Ascending the Tower as Snow Melts**\n\nThe last snow melts, the ice breaks open,\nThe wind and light gradually embrace the tower.\nThe traveler has not yet reached the sun’s edge,\nBut spring’s hues descend once more from heaven.\nMoreover, the cup never lacks wine—\nHow can the ridge bear to be without plum blossoms?\nWere it not for the prefect’s golden bond of friendship,\nWho would deign to pour their heart out for this unworthy one?\n\n---\n\n**Matching Prefect of Shang’s Poem on Moonlit Snow After Clearing**\n\nSnow fills the mountains, frost fills the courtyard,\nA cold radiance, the moon grinds a single wheel of light.\nThe wanderer’s heart holds little joy in fleeting time,\nYet the night’s brilliance, vast and white, is all in vain.\nBamboo near the curtains scatters broken shadows,\nWind through the pavilions carries lingering clarity.\nI regret having no fine verses to repay the splendid scene—\nAlone and forlorn, even dreams refuse to come.\n\n---\n\n**Matching Prefect of Shang’s Poem on Ascending the Tower After Snow Clears**\n\nA hundred-foot tower stands in the wake of light snow,\nAt dusk, the idle gaze grows piercingly clear.\nMountains stretch through evening mist, rising then falling,\nWater parts the sparse woods, faint yet bright.\nAt the sky’s edge, sunset glows in a thousand strands,\nThe wind carries the last notes of a distant horn.\nThis moment, this scene—truly fit for a painting,\nYet I fear the painter’s brush lacks such precision.\n\n---\n\n**New Year’s Eve on the Road**\n\n**New Year’s Eve on the Road**\n\nCountless moments stretch to the coming year—\nPour the fragrant wine again, let it flow.\nThe Dipper’s handle points to *chǒu*, the dark waning,\nThe year’s arrow strikes man, and spring returns once more.\nNo need for worldly cares to obstruct this hour,\nFor my heart’s tangle has long turned to ash.\nFleeting fame lies beyond the floating clouds—\nSwift as a breath, time presses on.\n\n---\n\n**Matching Prefect of Shang’s Poyn on the Auspicious Year of Jiayou (1061)**\n\nA weary frame in travel meets the new year,\nMoved by a lifetime’s hair, so quick to fade.\nThe cup drained, my breast remains desolate,\nJoy spent, my spirit sinks into ennui.\nGazing toward immortals, wind and moon shine clear,\nGreen blinds frame the night, so long and slow.\nFacing this lifeless form, mere clay and wood,\nI cannot but feel my soul dissolve.\n\n---\n\n**Matching Wang, Attendant of the Palace Secretariat, on Ascending the Prefecture Tower to View the Mountains**\n\nFour worthies once lingered here,\nA thousand years on, men still blush with shame.\nA man of renown finds the world hard to escape,\nWhile one with nothing in his breast idles in the hills.\nAffairs, seen through rise and fall of ages,\nReveal the Dao in ruler and minister’s advance and retreat.\nIf you harbor rare talent, rare use will find you—\nIf not, you must bear a lifetime’s leisure.\n\n---\n\n**Four Poems on the Temple of the Four White-Haired Ones**\n\n1.\nMighty Qin lost control, blood flowed wide,\nThe realm sought a lord, yet none could be found.\nJust when heroes locked horns in contest,\nWho knew into whose hands the deer would fall?\n\n2.\nThe true man of Bashang had already soared,\nThe four looked at one another, speechless.\nXu said, “Heaven’s mandate has its course—\nBetter to follow the tracks of Chao and Xu.”\n\n3.\nThe Han emperor’s pride could not bend them,\nOnly the crown prince’s humble words brought them forth.\nThough aged, they still achieved great deeds—\nTo this day, their lofty virtue shines like sun and stars.\n\n4.\nTian Heng fled to the sea and won renown,\nShang came to Chang’an, strong for a hundred *li*.\nOnly when the four were made to perfect their integrity\nDid one know Gaozu was a true king.\n\n---\n\n**Thanking Prefect of Shang, Song Langzhong, for Sending a Household Register for Mount Tianzhu, Following the Original Rhyme**\n\nA talisman from Shang flew here, fresh and new,\nFulfilling a bond beyond this life’s measure.\nMost joyous, the purple lingzhi first in hand—\nTianzhu in the southwest stands neighbor to heaven.\n\nMy first intent was to serve at the emperor’s side,\nBut spring’s Dipper turned in the capital’s circuit.\nNow to dwell beneath Tianzhu’s peak,\nNo fear of night travelers ahead.\n\nI do not present life and death to the august throne,\nBut embrace mist and haze, learning reclusion.\nMuch thanks to Magistrate Shi for leaving the right seat vacant,\nTo welcome once more a mountain man to Tianzhu.\n\nA cluster of mist and haze locks the drifting clouds,\nTianzhu’s lone height is fine for a true man’s perch.\nFrom now on, I make plans for a western return—\nWhy seek further fords among men?\n\n---\n\n**Four Poems on Mount Tianzhu**\n\n1.\nLong have I roamed with the deer, achieving nothing,\nYet deep is the grace of Magistrate Shi, who enrolled me.\nThrough ten thousand ages, name and surname endure—\nBound to Tianzhu’s peaks, they too shall remain.\n\n2.\nNo success, I’ve run with the herd of deer,\nBut your kindness runs deep, Magistrate, in granting me a register.\nThrough all time, name and fame persist—\nLet them abide with Tianzhu’s towering summits.\n\n---\n\n**To Prefect of Shang, Song Langzhong**\n\nReturning first to Luoyang, endless affairs await,\nA man of leisure, my place seems at odds.\nNow, at last, I feel ease and freedom,\nLike the carefree days on Shang’s slopes.\n\n---\n\n**Awakening from a Nap in the Small Garden**\n\nBeyond the gate, it seems a deep mountain,\nNature’s truth, truly, can be regained.\nBeyond the rush of caps and carriages,\nSun and moon pass in their course.\nThe garden’s waters flow with life,\nGrasses and trees idle in the windless air.\nSpring birds break my secluded dream,\nChattering on the branches, soft and sweet.\n\n---\n\n**Three Poems on Wandering the Mountains**\n\n1.\nLong confined in the city’s gates, my heart grows weary,\nThe moment I step beyond, my eyes brighten.\nI’ve seen all the sights of Dragon Gate on the Yi,\nListened to the last echoes of the Luo’s waters at Nüji.\nAt Mount Tai’s shrine, the red sun rises,\nFrom Heaven’s Altar, white clouds arise.\nThis body is already pledged to true companions—\nNot for trifles will I weigh gain or loss.\n\n2.\nSpring’s end is the perfect time for climbing,\nHuman feeling and heaven’s mood both harmonize.\nBoating on the Yi as the wind turns at night,\nFishing at the stream’s gate as the moon rises.\nMy carefree spirit soars, poetry runs wild,\nMy ailing frame relies on wine to sustain.\nFew are the days of this floating life—\nHow can I bear to furrow my brow between them?\n\n3.\nJoy is pursued, sorrow shunned—\nA true man knows fate.\nMinor deeds and fame are hard to secure,\nBut clouds and mountains bring me delight.\nFear not the distant mist and haze,\nWhile strength remains, ride it.\nBeyond enough, what joy is there?\nWealth and honor, once past, bring only grief.\n\n---\n\n**Two-Colored Peach Blossoms**\n\nRouge and powder both enhance their beauty,\nA dazzling charm to overthrow city and state.\nI suspect they are twin sisters from the Jewel Bud Realm,\nBoth willing at once to wed the spring wind.\n\n---\n\n**Composing Poems While Climbing Mountains and Facing Waters**\n\nMountains have towering peaks, waters have waves,\nNeither sandals nor boats can contain them.\nNot that wisdom and kindness lack joy in this,\nBut few who climb and face them shirk the toil.\nWords of taste know only sweet meats and roasts,\nWho speaks truly can recognize jade and jasper?\nI lament my failure to exhaust human talent—\nEver resenting how highly men judge today.\n\n---\n\n**Two Poems Thanking Grand Chancellor Fu for Summoning Me to Office**\n\n1.\nYour summons, much thanks, was not forgotten,\nThinking my breast held something to offer.\nIf I advanced, how could I bear official duties?\nAt leisure, why take a name in vain?\nThe messenger said, “If you do not wish to serve,\nYou may come and be granted a title of ease.”\nI wish to be like Chao and Xu, calling myself a subject,\nContent to grow old in the age of Yao and Shun.\n\n2.\nMy eyes are full of worthy men in court ranks,\nA sick man has no way to bind the realm’s fate.\nI wish to fulfill my plan to grow old in leisure,\nBut heaven’s intent remains unknown.\nHow many layers of carriages and caps repay the body’s worth?\nBetter to have clouds and mountains fill my gaze.\nFine scenes never fail to inspire verse,\nBut my bold heart has all dissolved away.\nThe swan and wild goose know the joys of rivers and lakes—\nWhy trouble with petty nets and snares?\n\n---\n\n**Responding to a Question on the Teachings of Names**\n\nSince the world’s beginning, teachings have spread,\nAmong them, the bold are called true Confucians.\nCultivating the self has its Dao—those who awaken first,\nWhat age has lacked men who grasped its mysteries?\nRadiant as cinnabar and ink, the meaning of classics and history,\nBright as sun and moon, the sage’s path.\nThough I, a humble student, have long immersed myself,\nHow dare I slander the world’s heroic talent?\n\n---\n\n**Seeing Off Academician Wang Bochu on His Mission to the Northern Capital**\n\nA man’s resolve is set when the coffin closes,\nHis grand designs weigh heavily.\nThe road ahead cannot be without nostalgia,\nBut in office, how can he bear to forget his feelings?\nIn leisure, speech must be precise,\nPlanning ahead ensures peace.\nYet the road ahead cannot be without nostalgia,\nAnd in office, how can he bear to forget his feelings?\n\nWho says there is no supreme strategy for governing the frontier?\nTo strike at the enemy’s plans—no troops are needed.\n\n*End of Volume Two of Yi Chuan’s \"Striking the Earth\"*\n*Yi Chuan Shao Yong Yaofu*\n\n**Congratulating a Retiring Official**\n\nCommon sentiment mostly delights in holding office,\nYet how could a man of understanding ever be bound?\nSurrendering the seal was never for scant salary,\nNor was hanging up the cap for advanced age.\nThrough things’ nature, he grasped the principles of rise and fall,\nAnd so awakened to Heaven’s power in acceptance and rejection.\nFitting to release his cares amid pure scenes—\nIn his homeland, fine forests and springs await.\n\n**Early Autumn**\n\nSummer departs, yet heat lingers still,\nAfter rain, coolness at last arrives.\nBefore the bridge, waters have long flowed,\nBeyond the sky, thunder yet startles.\nA curved armrest hides in quietude,\nThe crossbar gate opens in leisure.\nAll bold ambitions are now spent—\nWhy trouble the heart further?\n\n**Written in Passing**\n\nLaughable, yet also pitiable—\nWhat, after all, is human life?\nAll ten thousand affairs\nShould be gathered into a single song.\nWorldly affairs shift faster than a palm’s turn,\nYears pass swifter than rushing waves.\nIn stillness, the true qi’s savor—\nWhat is gained is beyond measure.\n\n**Injured Foot**\n\nMisfortune comes from the unexpected,\nYet the harm was never deep.\nSelf-betraying the principles of nurturing life,\nIt brought parents sorrowful concern.\nSuddenly, walking became difficult,\nBy chance, climbing was hindered.\nA month passed before I could go out—\nHard to forget the admonition of *Lezheng*.\n\n**Leisurely Stroll**\n\nThe garden lies desolate,\nI chant verses circling the marsh’s edge.\nWind startles after the first autumn sacrifice,\nLeaves fall before the frost arrives.\nWithered grass frames the slanting sun,\nEvening clouds prop up the distant sky.\nWhen shall I perceive the true image?\nOnly by entering wordlessness.\n\n**Morning Rising**\n\nMountains high, waters deep—\nNo remedy for the present.\nEarth holds the affairs of a moment,\nHeaven opens the heart of eternity.\nLight mist veils the morning pavilion,\nFine rain scatters through green woods.\nThough this scene is plain,\nWhere in the world can it be found?\n\n**Moonlit Night**\n\nRain clears, the wind is fine,\nAutumn’s touch, the sky not yet cold.\nI move my bed beneath the steps,\nWatching the moon rise from the forest’s edge.\nWine is here to share,\nBut no guests to join the joy.\nWhen later I meet a true friend,\nThis scene will be hard to seek again.\n\n**Basin Pond**\n\nThree or five small lotuses,\nA basin holds little water.\nThough not a vast marsh,\nStill, tiny waves arise.\nRoughly evoking rivers and lakes,\nYet no mandarin ducks or egrets pass.\nThe recluse’s delight is hard to suppress—\nOften pacing, drunk and chanting.\n\n**Two Poems on Roaming the Mountains**\n\nThe Luo River has many fine peaks,\nThe Yi River many fine bamboos.\nEach has its season for wandering,\nThough frequent, the eye never tires.\nSeeking purity is no breach of integrity,\nExploring the secluded is no disgrace.\nDeer do no harm to men—\nThe heart harms no deer.\n\nThe Two Peaks have many fine summits,\nThe Three Rivers many fine clouds.\nGazing without weariness,\nHarmonious qi subtly nurtures the spirit.\nIf a single thought stirs restlessly,\nTen thousand affairs follow in turmoil.\nPeople say the value of idleness is great—\nBecome a man of idleness.\n\n**Composed on the Road to Longmen**\n\nThe principles of things and human nature are clear,\nWhy fret over one’s life?\nExpansion and contraction lie in my calculations,\nUse and rejection follow the times, without fixed names.\nAll around, clouds and mountains are joy,\nNot a speck of glory or disgrace need startle.\nThe gates of nobles are said to be deep as the sea—\nFor thirty years, I’ve strolled past with arms swinging.\n\n**On Fame and Gain**\n\nFame and gain, in the end, are no joy,\nWind and waves ultimately offer little peace.\nSlightly near to good repute—take little,\nOnly when close to pure delight—seek more.\nGood repute, though abundant, must bring trouble,\nPure delight, though ample, brings no sorrow.\nDoes the world know this truth?\nYet in endless succession, they follow the overturned tracks.\n\n**Thirty Years’ Chant**\n\nThirty years span a generation,\nWithin them, much to laugh and sigh over.\nHeaven’s giving and taking never cease,\nHuman right and wrong never end.\nFortunate mandarin ducks—heads turn white early,\nThe cuckoo’s cry—blood flows first.\nKnow this: talent is the harm,\nYet when talent is gone, one still frets.\n\n**Responding to a Man’s Unrestrained Words**\n\nLong unseen—how have you fared?\nNew poems emerge with laughter and words anew.\nThrough things’ principles, awakening deepens temperament’s calm,\nAfter grasping Heaven’s heart, emotions grow distant.\nYou’ve fully attained Meng’s joy—boundless,\nYet to know Qu’s non-self—still in excess.\nMostly, empty fame is as you say—\nThis body willingly ages among woodcutters and fishermen.\n\n**First Outing to the Luo River, Leaving Through Houzai Gate**\n\nFirst stepping beyond the capital’s gate,\nWest and south, toward the Luo’s corner.\nMountains and rivers open distant thoughts,\nHeaven and earth hang in both eyes.\nVillages at dusk amid mulberries and elms,\nFarmers’ fields of millet and sorghum in autumn.\nThe people have such joy—\nWhy wait for enfeoffment?\n\n**Staying at Yanqiu Village**\n\nDriving the carriage into the Luo River valley,\nDismounting to play by the flying spring.\nSuddenly, the joy of clouds and mountains,\nUtterly free of court and market clamor.\nNot only does it delight the heart and will,\nIt naturally forgets the body’s words.\nAsking friends in the dust—\nWho has grasped it first?\n\n**Staying at the West Temple of Shou’an**\n\nFine scenes truly move the heart,\nDirectly refreshing flesh and bone.\nFor the many fine vistas,\nEspecially glad to be near the capital.\nBamboo hues blend with mountain hues,\nPine sounds mingle with water sounds.\nHow could I refuse to love it all day?\nI set my mat beside the empty pillars.\n\n**Two Poems Crossing Yongji Bridge**\n\nBehind the mountains, a brocade screen unfolds,\nThe river bends by Yongji’s turn.\nFields level as a palm,\nMulberries and oaks large as locust trees.\nThe slanting sun shoots through the rainbow’s departure,\nLow clouds bring approaching rain.\nEndlessly, I waste this pure scene—\nAlways ashamed of my lack of talent.\n\nA stream, a creek—each a gate,\nCreek gates where clouds gather again.\nRare birds warble in tall trees,\nSecluded deer dart through wild brambles.\nRain trails across the flat land,\nRice paddies prop up distant villages.\nThe high city is half ruined—\nMatters of rise and fall—best not discussed.\n\n**Composed Upon Reaching Fuchang County**\n\nHow many love pure scenes?\nThose who do must seek them far.\nOnly when near Han Peak,\nDoes one see the Luo River’s depth.\nThe county lies in the clouds and mountains’ embrace,\nThe people dwell in the heart of waters and bamboos.\nFree of schemes, like idle things,\nI feel even fewer know me.\n\n**At Yan Hall**\n\nUpon the river, several peaks green,\nAmid the woods, a stream bright.\nWandering clouds have no fixed form,\nSecluded birds bear no names.\nCompanions were not prearranged,\nReturn dates cannot be set.\nThe trifles of the human world—\nCease striving to be fierce.\n\n**Viewing the Southern Mountains from the Upper Temple**\n\nPeak upon peak,\nWestward, they stretch to Liang and Yong’s expanse.\n\nTo view while traveling is not as good as to observe while seated.\nEncompassing Tang and Han, engulfing Jin and Han,\nSunk and vanished—matters hard to inquire,\nOnly you remain, towering and rugged.\n\n**At the County Magistrate’s Lotus Pond Study**\n\nBefore the magistrate’s small study,\nThe water is clear, the pond bears lotuses.\nNot only to gaze at the blossoms,\nBut also to listen to the murmuring stream.\nJust like by rivers and lakes,\nFar from the dust and earth.\nWhere the ancients applied their minds,\nSurely not in vain.\n\n**The Shrine of Lady Ji**\n\nTo the southwest stands a lofty mountain,\nShrouded in the dim and distant.\nImmortals cannot be seen,\nOnly endless clouds and mist.\nThe thousand-year-old shrine of Lady Ji,\nIts gate by the banks of the Luo River.\nOnly the strains of *Nishang* remain,\nStill passed down among the people.\n\n**The Ruins of Lianchang Palace**\n\nThe Luo River comes from the southwest,\nThe Chang River from the northwest.\nWhere the two waters merge,\nPalace walls bear remnant bricks.\nTravelers vainly imagine,\nAll past affairs now mere traces.\nOnly Lady Ji’s mountain remains,\nFacing the Three Villages Post.\n\n**On the River, Recalling the Past**\n\nLast autumn I roamed the source of the Luo,\nThis autumn I roam the Luo’s course.\nThough the river’s waters are unfeeling,\nThe human heart grows still.\nEyes dazzled by a thousand mountains,\nEach peak wreathed in mist.\nWhen the mountains end, the mist does not,\nMerging with the boundless sky.\nFarmers busy tending crops,\nWaterfowl idly seeking fish.\nOne toils for food, the other rests—\nHow different their ways.\nYet when events pass, joy and sorrow are seen,\nWhen times change, expansion and contraction are known.\nLooking back at these two,\nSwitched in place—what then?\nToday’s mountains were once plains,\nToday’s plains were once rivers.\nIf even mountains and rivers change so,\nHow much more should human affairs be trusted?\nFortunate to escape the red dust,\nI ride the wind and waves, lashing the whip.\nThe land stretches far, rivers and plains vast,\nA lone village by misty waters at ease.\nLightning flickers as dragons cross the shore,\nClouds scatter as rain shifts the mountains.\nFarmers shoulder their hoes and leave,\nFishermen return with nets on their backs.\nOnly I am drenched,\nStill on the road.\n\n**Summer Drinking at Yan Hall**\n\nYan Hall opens to the heights,\nIts eaves clinging to jagged cliffs.\nCool winds come through pine boughs,\nClear springs cascade through bamboo shade.\nFine fruits mingle red and green,\nChoice wine flows shallow and deep.\nYet I recall the bustling markets,\nWhere stifling heat cannot be borne.\n\n**Leisure at Yan Hall**\n\nThe net of heaven is wide, hard to escape,\nThe net of the world is dense, impossible to pass.\nMy heart long unmoved,\nFreed from both nets.\nTall bamboos rinse in clear springs,\nTowering pines welcome the pure wind.\nOr again: the moon between pines, so free,\nThe wind beyond bamboos, so cool.\nAt this moment, meeting this scene,\nIt perfectly matches this heart.\n\n**Composed on the River on the Day of Beginning of Autumn**\n\nWealth and honor are hard to love,\nPoverty and cold easily bring sorrow.\nDo not carry youthful airs\nInto old age as shame.\nSince there is extraordinary joy,\nBeware of unexpected grief.\nWho can guarantee the end from the beginning,\nTo remain forever a duke or marquis?\n\n**Discourse on Bear Ear Mountain**\n\nLong ago, Yu divided the Nine Provinces,\nGuiding the Luo from Bear Ear.\nBear Ear has two peaks—\nWhich one is correct?\nThe eastern one lies near Chengzhou,\nThe western one is cut off by the Dan River.\nThe records speak of Shangluo—\nThis saying is right.\n\n**Climbing Lady Ji’s Mountain**\n\nI have seen many mountains,\nBut never encountered such marvels.\nVast cliffs like crouching tigers,\nPerilous rocks like unfurled banners.\nClouds idle, now spreading, now rolling,\nRock forms shifting again and again.\nEven with brush and ink, hard to depict—\nOn all sides, it is just so.\n\n**Gazing South at Yi River from the River**\n\nThe mountain retains Yu’s chiseled gate,\nThe river holds Yao’s water marks.\nThe ancients are no longer seen,\nYet their traces may still remain.\nYears and months easily wither,\nGood and evil are hard to bury.\nDo not pursue fame in recent times,\nStriving for worldly esteem.\n\n**The Cowherd Boy**\n\nFollowing with hat and raincoat,\nNever disturbing heaven’s harmony.\nWarmth plays by the ruined city,\nCold nestles by ancient tombs.\nA few notes from the ox-back flute,\nA tune from the ridge’s song.\nHe seems without care,\nAsking nothing of court affairs.\n\n**Chanting in a Dream on the Road to Three Villages**\n\nSpeaking of dreams within a dream, still remembered,\nAwake from the dream, the dream is yet distant.\nToday’s favor and glory are empty joy,\nYesterday’s love and affection are hard to find.\nWhere water flows, how can there be no sound?\nWhen flowers fade, how can there be color?\nPassing this, meeting strangers on the road,\nAll as if never known before.\n\n**Thirty-Six Autumn Thoughts**\n\n**I**\nThe autumn night begins long,\nStars and constellations vie in brilliance.\nThe courtyard, washed by light rain,\nPillow and mat grow slightly cool.\nShining on things, no form escapes,\nThe empty mirror has its own light.\nShining on affairs, no feeling escapes,\nThe empty heart has its own constancy.\n\n**II**\nAt the bright window, the sun’s glow fades,\nThe secluded courtyard, freshly washed by rain.\nRed orchids quietly unfold,\nGreen bamboos idly lean together.\nHonor and profit like floating clouds,\nFeelings as light as water.\nNot a man from beyond the heavens,\nYet thoughts arise from beyond the heavens.\n\n**III**\nThe bright moon rises from the sea’s heart,\nCool winds stir at the sky’s edge.\nThings reveal themselves,\nThe heart suddenly opens wide.\nUnderstanding all the power of Zhou and Confucius,\nUntying the knots of benevolence and righteousness.\nRites and laws were meant to guard against treachery,\nNot set for us.\n\n**IV**\nSparse rain drips on the tall parasol tree,\nGentle winds brush the tender willows.\nThis scene repeats year after year,\nYet people still grow old.\nWorldly cares easily entangle,\nDusty hearts hard to shake off.\nFloating life is already in a dream,\nForcing existence within it.\n\n**V**\nClear rapids pattern mandarin ducks,\nCold pools embroider cormorants.\nThe vast sky, pure as water,\nDoes not hinder the autumn river’s green.\nA man’s inch-long heart,\nA warrior’s match for ten thousand foes.\nAmid lotus-scented winds,\nA lone boat—we will meet again.\n\n**VI**\nYesterday I longed for cool broth,\nToday I long to put away the fan.\nNot only do people wield spears,\nHeat and cold wage their own battles.\nProfit and harm arise from feeling,\nLikes and dislikes depend on perception.\nTo wish others to be good,\nOne must first be good oneself.\n\n**VII**\nSweet persimmons, green as indigo,\nRed peaches, fresh as blood.\nI cannot bear to pluck them with my hands,\nMuch less bite them with my teeth.\nTheir color is already lovely,\nTheir taste even more exquisite.\nEating them, no fine words,\nAlas for mouth and tongue.\n\n**VIII**\nThe nation’s fate lies with the people,\nThe people’s fate lies with food.\nEven if the sages were reborn,\nThis saying would not change.\n\nEmpty favors—how could they be esteemed?\nThey teach men to indulge and coddle.\nEmpty fame—how could it be exalted?\nIt teaches men to adorn and deceive.\n\nThe *Zhou Odes* speak of taking a wife,\nThe *Zhou Yi* speaks of the maiden’s return.\nThe Seventh Night’s worldly passions,\nThe pleading for skill in girls’ frivolous postures.\nAt dusk, clouds and rain pass—\nPeople say the Herd-Boy and Weaver Girl meet.\nYet the thunderbolt’s trace vanishes without a mark,\nHow could the Herd-Boy and Weaver Girl be paired?\n\nA pure breeze needs no companion—\nIt enters my hands of its own accord.\nThe bright moon needs no peer—\nIt enters my window of its own will.\nWhen the heart is already at peace,\nWhat outer thing could ever tempt?\n\nTrivial matters—why discuss them?\nI only fear the wine jar will run dry.\nGreen plantain leaves unfurl,\nBlue reeds bow low.\nWind and rain howl through the sky,\nThe night deepens with the water-clock’s drip.\n\nThose things are blameless in themselves,\nWhy should this feeling surprise?\nYet I think of the traveler on the road,\nStill lingering at the edge of the horizon.\nFaint mist veils the sparse woods,\nA light wind sways the cold rain.\nAt dusk, people have all returned,\nOnly the flock of chickens still pecks at the millet.\n\nThis heart remains unmoved,\nYet this matter is most difficult to handle.\nTo sum it up in a single word—\nI fear even that would waste breath.\n\nIn the eighth month, heat and chill balance,\nThe qi and flavor are naturally fine.\nFacing the void, tall trees bow low,\nFrom afar, the traveler appears small.\nAll traces of affairs are illusions,\nWith a heart devoid of intent, things are all resolved.\nWhy ask further about bitterness?\nI wish only that you taste the smartweed yourself.\n\nYellow millet ripens in autumn,\nYellow chickens grow plump in autumn.\nThese things are easily obtained,\nThe ancients held them in high regard.\nThey can welcome guests and friends,\nThey can serve one’s parents’ chambers.\nWith coarse cloth, one can endure the year—\nWhat else is worth pursuing?\n\nRice is born of heaven,\nYeast is crafted by man.\nFerment it and call it wine—\nDrink it, and one may become drunk.\nThe rigid it makes supple,\nThe timid it makes resolute.\nIt skillfully wields the power of creation—\nIts merit is no small thing.\n\nAutumn’s hues deepen day by day,\nThe old heart grows ever more indolent.\nWeary, I descend the steps to walk,\nAt leisure, I toy with books and scrolls.\nWide roads teem with wind and dust,\nI hear it is hard to find a moment’s rest.\nThe gates of noble houses are already deep,\nThe imperial palace’s gates are even more distant.\nThe frontier geese have yet to arrive,\nThe swallows of the rafters have already departed.\nClouds and mountains stretch in a thousand layers—\nWhere shall we meet again?\n\nThe city gates of Jiye rise high,\nThe long pavilion roads wind far.\nThe land’s ways ruin men’s clothes—\nNewly made, they soon turn old.\nBeyond the intermittent cries of cicadas,\nSparse hawks descend ahead.\nThe years pass in vain,\nHuman affairs grow ever more desolate.\n\nWashing the bamboo to preserve new shoots,\nTurning the pages to find old writings.\nWho knows the one who nurtures the heart\nWould ever vie with the world for power?\n\nThe Mid-Autumn’s scenery is fine,\nThe Central Plains’ mist and waters are wondrous.\nThe season of the first chill,\nThe moment when men are half-drunk.\nThe couch awaits the bright moon’s sweep,\nThe lapel awaits the fine wind’s caress.\nA single matter in the heart—\nThe world knows nothing of it.\n\nA fine moon fills the high tower,\nThe high tower still in Mid-Autumn.\nAt midnight, cold dew descends,\nA thousand miles of cold light flows.\nWho will take up this mirror,\nWipe it clean, newly polished, and rest?\nIlluminating one breaks the heart of ten thousand ages,\nWhitening ten thousand ages’ heads.\n\nCold dew clings to withered grass,\nA bleak wind shakes the evening woods.\nBird cries rise and fall,\nThe sky’s mood shifts from clear to overcast.\nThe season changes in an instant,\nThe heart holds a thousand ages’ longing.\nWho says Ziji is dead?\nThe whole world lacks a knowing friend.\n\nWind-tossed willows scatter like a comb,\nFrost-laden clouds thin as a broom’s sweep.\nA high tower pierces the perilous void,\nLow mist sways in the early cold.\nAt this moment, my mood is boundless—\nHow can I battle autumn’s aging?\nI can only take up the wine bottle\nAnd pour it out to the west wind.\n\nPond lotuses daily wither,\nHedge chrysanthemums daily flourish.\nAmong the ranks of things,\nThey contend with the seasons’ rhythm.\nFlourishing and decay do not coincide,\nThe worthy and foolish cannot walk side by side.\nHow can one obtain the heart of pine and cassia,\nEvergreen through all four seasons?\n\nMen grow old as autumn grows older,\nMountains deepen, waters deepen.\nTall trees have already shed their leaves,\nWise birds sing in vain.\nSinews and bones are not as they once were,\nVirtue betrays its original intent.\nFortunately, my remaining writings endure—\nFrom time to time, they may still be sought.\n\nIn the ninth month, the qi suddenly turns stern,\nWithered willows still harbor cicadas.\nBeyond the frost, sparse bells fall silent,\nThe wind’s remnants carry clear sounds.\nA thousand mountains confuse the distant gaze,\nA lone osprey soars into the high heavens.\nIf one is not a transcendent being,\nHow dare one speak of perilous deeds?\n\nPears redden under heavy frost,\nPomegranates split after long rain.\nThese fruits are called treasures of the world,\nTheir flavors are truly astonishing.\nThe earth holds a hundred things in readiness,\nHeaven hangs not a single word.\nI fear I still have words,\nUnable to match the workings of creation.\n\nOnly in the south are fine tangerines,\nOnly in the north are fine chestnuts.\nTheir husks may be somewhat alike,\nTheir flavors are surely not the same.\nDo heaven and earth lack feeling?\nAll plants and trees bear fruit.\nThings do not betray man—\nMan betrays himself to things.\n\nButterflies flutter around cold chrysanthemums,\nCrickets chirp on empty steps.\nA dog lies at the gate,\nAll day, no guests arrive.\nClear waves flow in stillness,\nWhite clouds pile in leisure.\nHow to bring forth heaven’s harmony?\nFrom time to time, drink a cup of wine.\n\nRed leaves battle the west wind,\nYellow blossoms laugh at the cold sun.\nThe Dao of heaven has its waxing and waning,\nHuman affairs have no fixed certainty.\nStillness prevails, leaving a lingering savor,\nDreams depart, revealing what was lost.\nProfit and harm do not follow one another,\nRight and wrong only then emerge.\n\nOn the Double Ninth, climbing high to gather,\nSeeking the secluded to share refined joy.\nCustoms follow old traditions,\nThe weather offers a light chill.\nWhite wine is drunk in unstrained drafts,\nYellow blossoms are viewed with dew still clinging.\nThe floating world’s affairs sink away—\nWhy should one value fleeting waves?\n\nMountains stretch into the evening haze,\nCrows vanish beyond the lone wisp of smoke.\nFading chrysanthemums fear the frost’s crushing,\nHidden orchids dread the wind’s ruin.\nHardship and danger—people do not favor them,\nWealth and honor—people cherish them.\nMy heart is not my own—\nHow could love and hate be for sale?\n\nWater grows cold, revealing the heart of the pool,\nTrees shed their leaves, baring the mountain’s bones.\nOnly now do I believe heaven has no bounds—\nTen thousand miles do not separate things.\nI shed my clothes and hang them on Fusang,\nReach my hand to explore the moon’s cave.\nNot betraying the heart of benevolence and righteousness—\nA mere fifty-one years.\n\nGrass is green, dew soaks the clothes,\nGrass withers, wind cuts the skin.\nThings’ feelings do not change—\nMen’s minds forcibly conjure doubt.\n\nThe fork stirs, Yang Zhu weeps;\nThe thread lengthens, Mozi grieves.\nKnowing this—why so late?\nIn vain, tears stream down.\n\nBeyond ten thousand miles of clear sky,\nA slice of moon on the frost.\nTall pines stand evergreen,\nWhile all other blooms fade and vanish.\nTeeth daily grow weaker,\nHair daily falls away.\nOffenses already mount high—\nThis heart cannot be trifled with.\n\nGrass withers, mountains and rivers grow poor;\nTrees shed, heaven and earth grow lean.\nDust fills the wind’s path,\nSunlight barely slips through cloud-gaps.\nThe past cannot be chased again,\nThe future may yet be saved.\nOther matters I dare not speak—\nTo speak them would surely bring blame.\n\nWine I drink, not too much,\nA few cups flush face and heart.\nBefore drunk, I cannot stop;\nOnce drunk, persuasion is vain.\nWho says the ten thousand things are vast?\nDo they extend beyond heaven and earth’s bounds?\nWho says the ten thousand affairs are broad?\nDo they stretch beyond the realm of human feeling?\n\n**Poem for Prefect Zhang of Shanzhou at Stone Pillar Village**\nYou serve as Prefect of Shanzhou,\nI am truly a descendant of Lord Kang.\nOur first ancestor left a noble legacy—\nI entrust you to seek what remains.\nYou sent me a poem,\nTitled *Stone Pillar Village*.\nWhen the stone pillar was first erected,\nIts origins were lost in antiquity.\nThe *Fen Shaan Inscription* was carved there,\nYet only Tang scholars spoke of it.\nYears have passed in great number,\nIts beginning and end now lack complete text.\nHard to verify or correct,\nHow then to trace its source?\nI lament my scant reading,\nMy knowledge no greater than others’.\nBeyond classics and histories,\nI cannot dispel the world’s confusion.\nIf following Changqing’s *Gongyang*,\nIt should begin at Shaan.\nIf following your *Chen Biming*,\nIt should speak of Zhou’s completion.\nTaking both together,\nThe meaning may yet be honored.\nDividing governance between east and west suburbs,\nOne may discuss it in terms of Shaan and Luo.\nIf this explanation nears the mark,\nPerhaps it may ease the tangle.\n\nThe sweet pear’s shade still flourishes,\nThe stone pillar remains fresh and green.\nThe grand affairs of that time,\nI could not witness firsthand.\nThe pure teachings of *Er Nan*,\nThe noble fragrance of those two lords—\nA tale of beauty for a thousand years,\nI may yet hear of it.\n\nTo abandon the classics and rely on commentaries,\nConfucian scholars fundamentally reject.\nI write this poem to clarify,\nHastening this humble reply to you.\n\n**Free Expression**\nHaving attained the joy of stillness and emptiness,\nI am no longer startled by favor or disgrace.\nMud and void—still attachments;\nEqualizing things—ultimately a struggle.\nIdly I pick up the brush,\nFrom time to time writing my own name.\nWho can truly harm their nature,\nTo conjure feelings beyond feeling?\n\n*Volume Three of Yi Chuan’s \"Striking the Earth Collection\" concludes.*\n*Volume Four of Yi Chuan’s \"Striking the Earth Collection\" begins.*\n\n**Thanking Minister Wang Jun of the Bureau of Etiquette for the Completion of the New Residence in Tianjin**\n*Seventh Year of Jiayou (1062)*\n\nIn the *renyin* year of Jiayou,\nThe new nest’s work was just □.\nStill part of Daode Lane,\nYet nearer the imperial palace.\nRailings face the towering Gate of Correct Deportment,\nVerandas welcome the mighty Two Observatories.\nWindows open to the echoes of Chan and Jian streams,\nTerraces distant, gleaming with Yi and Song peaks.\nFine scenery is ever hard to come by,\nAuspicious times are not easily met.\nLacking talent to aid the realm,\nI am content to enjoy a year of abundance.\nWater and bamboo cradle the heart,\nOrioles and flowers dwell in deep pools.\nLike Lao Lai, my joy knows no end,\nThe delight of quiet integrity is boundless.\nCarefree, I keep company with true friends,\nPlanning to congratulate Your Excellency.\nMy red sincerity is but self-expression—\nNot repayment for your profound kindness.\n\n**New Spring Chant**\nAt fifty-two, my bones and sinews ail,\nYet this new spring I still share cups with friends.\nXunzi’s words on embodying form—ever rare,\nHui’s joy within—unmatched in merit.\nSwallows come and go, vainly toiling,\nFlowers bloom and fade, heedlessly hastening.\nThis heart does not sway for others’ joys or sorrows—\nFor twenty years, it has been as ash.\n\n**A Guest’s Chant**\nBetween Yi and Song, a guest would speak no words,\nAdvancing or retreating—all awaits heaven’s will.\nLoving quiet, I cannot forget streams and stones,\nFinding joy in leisure—not to learn immortality.\nNo need to sigh over purple streets, hard for guests,\nJust delight in the clean wind, which costs no coin.\nWhy quibble over bending a foot to gain a yard?\nThis heart is vast—it seeks no perfection.\n\n**Encountering Spring in the Small Garden**\nContent with pavilions and railings, I too play at beauty,\nNo harm in lingering by the wine stove.\nNight eaves quietly admit the moon through flowers,\nDaytime doors chill with mist beyond the bamboo.\nThings, once understood, are all by chance—\nHeaven’s decree to be idle is not in vain.\nHow much time fills the gourd’s sun and moon?\nTwelve years of splendid scenery, wantonly seized.\n\n**Late Spring Chant**\nSpring arrives, the small garden teems with blossoms—\nWho dwells in poverty, who in wealth and honor?\nBeyond the gate, willow shade floats in emerald luster,\nBefore the steps, flower shadows glide in crimson light.\nNew swallows under the beams have yet to tune their tongues,\nReturning geese at the sky’s edge have already taken flight.\nI ask my heart’s source—what does it hold?\nIt answers: a fondness for carefree indolence.\n\n**Cherishing the Fragrant and Luxuriant**\nWeighing the world’s thousand affairs,\nAll lose to flowers’ shared delight.\nMost of spring’s splendor lasts but a season,\nIts full glory barely ten days.\nI fear sorrow may bring discord,\nAnd guard against wind and rain’s hardships.\nLet not regret follow after—\nBefore the fire fades, one may still climb.\n\n**Reply to a Gift**\nMy temples need not fret over turning frost,\nFor I have the solace of zither and books, and you.\nLacking great talent to serve a flourishing age,\nI can but rest my head on the southern window.\nI know my strength cannot be forced,\nYet still speak of mountains and clouds not yet surrendered.\nDeep thanks to my old friend for such love—\nLike a stranded fish, I am spared from the western river’s plight.\n\n**Playing with the Brush**\nAt fifty-two, what more have I to fear in old age?\nAffairs are valued when seen to the bottom,\nWords are hard to speak to the end.\nAbove, there is a bright Son of Heaven,\nBelow, worthy lords and nobles.\nBeyond a full belly and sound sleep,\nI seek nothing more.\n\n**Begging Wine from a Friend**\nA hundred ailments plague this old body,\nWhite-haired today, I shamefully drift along.\nThough no purple edict summons me back to court,\nGreen mountains often enter my dreams.\nWho is master of wind and moon filling the sky?\nAre there no men in forests and springs across the land?\nMarket wine’s flavor is rarely pure—\nI long betray my heart’s springtime.\n\n**Reply to a Guest**\nCountless acquaintances in the world,\nThough many know me, few truly do.\nMost gaze upon me for the Dao,\nYet know me shallowly through my poems.\nAsk not of rise and fall in a hundred years—\nPast and present all return to one game of chess.\n\n**Riding a Steed**\nOne must seek a mount like the qilin or steed,\nYet how can such a steed appear in due time?\n\n**A Word of Enlightenment**\nA hundred schemes still prove clumsy,\nBut one word of confusion may yet dissolve.\nThe world holds no great matters,\nYet the land abounds with heroic talent.\nI fear only that men are hard to find,\nNot that the Dao remains unrevealed.\nWhen envy’s heart is wholly cast aside,\nWhat dust remains to trouble me?\n\n**Thanks for the Gift of a Brush**\nI cherish this gift of the study,\nGratefully received from afar.\nThe rabbit’s hair is firm and strong,\nThe bamboo shaft straight and long.\nIn stillness, I transcribe new poems,\nIn leisure, I copy old remedies.\nBeyond such uses, it is enough\nTo nurture the blade’s keen edge.\n\n**Composed on Affairs**\nHeaven and earth hold eternal principles,\nSun and moon never hide their forms.\nBeyond a full belly and sound sleep,\nAll else is but empty fame.\nThough lacking the talents of Yi or Lü,\nI remain a subject of Yao and Shun.\nWhy must one become a minister\nTo bring about great peace?\n\n**Twin-Lotus Blossoms**\nThe Han court’s graceful sisters,\nThe divine maidens of Tiantai’s peaks—\nAll once knew the passions of their time,\nYet were banished to earth as auspicious lotuses.\n\n**Reply to a Letter**\nConfucius spoke of rectifying one’s nature,\nZiyou of embodying one’s form.\nWho attains these two\nLives not in vain.\nIf friendships are forged through the Dao,\nAnd feelings stirred by sincerity,\nThen though three armies stand before you,\nNone can overpower you.\n\n**In Response to a Letter**\nWithout rank, establishing deeds is hard;\nMeeting the times, achieving merit is easy.\nSeeking perfection invites ruin,\nPursuing greatness requires overlooking details.\nTo reject evil risks wounding kindness,\nTo tolerate evil risks harming righteousness.\nThough the heart of a benevolent man beats,\nHis intent remains far from true benevolence.\n\n**Reply to a Letter**\nA minister’s yearly stipend\nWould fund a poor scholar’s lifetime.\nWorldly titles differ,\nBut the heavenly title is never lacking.\nWithout frost and snow,\nHow would we know the pine and cassia?\nThough no office elevates me,\nHow can the Dao not ennoble me?\n\n**Reminiscing with an Old Friend**\nWhat ears and eyes have witnessed,\nI recount from thirty springs.\nTen intercalary months have passed,\nAnd people have changed once more.\nThe old families cling to their ways,\nWhile the vermilion gates host new carriages.\nAll has always been by chance—\nWhat can be called true merit?\n\n**Idle Verses**\nCasually I take up my brush,\nEver delighting in the spirit’s play.\nNever without a scene to match,\nYet never bound by emotion.\nLines come drifting into being,\nPoems form by chance.\nThe workings of heaven are hard to describe—\nYet one point stands clear.\n\n**Idle Sitting**\nI once planned for the years ahead,\nYet today’s affairs elude my grasp.\nHeaven’s mandate does not favor me,\nSo I find solace in mountains and clouds.\nThrough no merit of my own, I grow detached,\nAnd so approach the realm of the profound.\nI would mock the true master,\nWho toils without knowing why.\n\n**Strolling at Tianjin**\nThe Son of Heaven’s ancient domain,\nWhere lush vitality still lingers.\nGardens and woods lie near the water,\nPalaces and towers stretch into autumn’s distance.\nThe waves recall summer’s heat,\nThe bridge’s rainbow fades not in the clear sky.\nOn days when the world knows no strife,\nThis place invites lingering.\n\n**Secluded at Tianjin**\nMy home lies within Luoyang’s walls,\nAnd here, too, at Tianjin’s edge.\nThe sun rises early here,\nSpring comes easily to the low sky.\nTime favors the state’s flourishing,\nScenery enriches the recluse.\nI may now cast aside cap and sash,\nAnd grow old in leisure here.\n\n**The Sound of Tianjin’s Waters**\nThe Luo River flows near my hut,\nIts murmurs reaching my pillow’s emptiness.\nThe rapids startle in late autumn,\nThe waves quicken at the fifth watch’s dawn.\nGentle winds trace their delicate paths,\nFierce rains swell their mighty currents.\nFor the recluse, this is joy enough—\nWhy wait for pipes and zithers?\n\n**Sleepless**\nThe night deepens as I sit idly,\nYet sleep eludes me in the long hours.\nTossing, I cannot rest,\nAnd so reflect on past affairs.\nPillow laid, my mind grows dull,\nBlanket drawn, my thoughts remain bright.\nIn the moonlit western window,\nA few leaves of the plantain sway.\n\n**The Small Pavilion of Heavenly Palace**\nIn summer, I reach the Heavenly Palace,\nLeaning on the railing, my gaze knows no bounds.\nThe ancients held lofty aspirations,\nThe Son of Heaven built a mighty capital.\nPavilions lie deep within clouds,\nMountains and rivers fade into evening mist.\nTravelers come and go in vain—\nWho shares this sentiment?\n\n**Listening to the Qin**\nThe qin is best heard at night,\nAwakening a different feeling.\nJust as the mournful gibbons fall silent,\nThe parting phoenix begins its cry.\nThe green mountains stretch endlessly,\nWhite hair need not cause alarm.\nOnly when one grasps the mind of sitting-in-forgetfulness\nDoes one know the heart of the distant past.\n\n**Twenty-Six Reflections on Tianjin**\n\nLight clouds, pale sun—dusk at Tianjin,\nFierce winds, sparse woods—autumn on the Luo.\nWalking alone, chanting alone, none understand,\nAs gulls and egrets alight on the islets.\n\nFavor and disgrace—matters now unseen,\nRise and fall—times gone, only sorrow remains.\nLook upon Chang’an’s roads today—\nEven at dusk, people still come and go.\n\nThe phoenix tower’s depths lock away clouds and mist,\nA hundred years pass with each sealing.\nGrieving for the sacrifices at Fenyin’s western altar,\nThe imperial banners betray the heavens of Shangyang.\n\nWho drew the long river through Luoyang’s walls?\nThe imperial carriage’s eastward journey made light of this place.\nThe mighty waves chafe at Tianjin’s restraints,\nDay and night roaring in furious tumult.\n\nThe sun sets in the west, waters flow east,\nTime shifts through the passing years.\nDistant mountains gather their dark hues on all sides—\nWho do they grieve for all day long?\n\nBusy men bear burdens—what difference between the two?\nComing and going always follow this path.\nHow much better to sit idly, untalented,\nWith clouds and waters swirling about my robes.\n\nThey say fishing discerns the floating and sinking,\nBut such discernment demands deep intent.\nI am ashamed not to know the harm in desire,\nYet lightly stir my heart in hope of catching fish.\n\nSince ancient times, abandoned capitals hold many empty spaces,\nTowering trees teem with cawing crows at dusk.\nWhere crumbling walls and broken ramparts are tilled by men,\nHalf were once the homes of ministers and nobles.\n\nThe phoenix towers stand cold in autumn’s chill,\nBeneath the bridge, long waves flow toward the sea.\nFor a thousand years, this was the old imperial market—\nHow many times have people passed through here?\n\nHooves and wheels clash without cease,\nDeparting as if in pursuit, arriving as if in contest.\nI reckon their hearts hold no other concern—\nIf not for profit, then for fame.\n\nTrees fade into autumn’s embrace,\nHomes nestle amid the sound of waters.\nA few rows of crows fly off at an angle,\nA cluster of towers clings precariously to the void.\n\nThe clear waters stretch to the azure sky,\nThe level plains merge with distant mountains.\nAn old man with white hair, his heart at ease,\nLeans idly on the railing, gazing at the Luo River.\n\nLast year’s man who leaned on the bridge’s railing,\nThis year rides past its edge on horseback.\nBridge above and bridge below—countless crossings,\nYet now I recall only thirteen springs.\n\nBy the embankment, grasses grow lush and green,\nOn the paths, travelers come and go.\nThe clear waters strive for purity but never attain it,\nThe spring winds refuse to let the willow branches rest.\n\nThough currents rush, the scene remains serene,\nThough blossoms fall in profusion, the mind stays at ease.\nUnlike men of the world who age in busyness,\nNever once in their lives knowing an open smile.\n\nBy the stream, I sit idly, my eyes half-lidded,\nWaves strike the long embankment as if to break it.\nHow many waterfowl, their plumage bright with color,\nAgain and again take flight, then return.\n\nFame and profit have always followed talent,\nNo need for travelers to guess at one another’s schemes.\nHow much time lies within the gourd’s embrace?\nI stroll the Heavenly Ford, watching the ebb and flow.\n\nThe land tilts southeastward as a whole,\nWhen will its waters ever find peace?\nThe Heavenly Ford lies where the currents race fastest—\nEndless depths, all roaring with the same sound.\n\nThree thousand *li* away, the frontier is called wild,\nFor a hundred years, the realm has been at peace.\nYet how can it compare to the carefree man of the Luo River,\nWho needs no fief to know true honor?\n\nWillows sway around the embankment in the soft wind,\nPavilions across the water stand veiled in fine rain.\nAfter the Double Ninth, wine leaves one half-tipsy—\nAt this moment, the flavor is beyond compare.\n\nObserving the world’s affairs from a place of stillness,\nRefining one’s feelings in leisure’s embrace:\nWhen all storms subside and only still waters remain,\nWhat in this world cannot be made level?\n\nSince Sui and Tang, nobles and ministers have been exalted,\nIn recent times, men chase fame and profit through turmoil.\nI ask the waters beneath the Heavenly Ford Bridge:\nWhat sound did their rushing make in those days?\n\nCountless nobles and ministers of former dynasties—\nLater ages remember only their names.\nYet these waters beneath the Heavenly Ford Bridge\nHave flowed with the same sound from ancient times to now.\n\nNot a wisp of cloud dares touch the bright moon,\nThe bridge spans a thousand *xun*, lying across the green waves.\nI reckon no such scene exists in the human world—\nHow could one’s mood not soar when gazing at the moon on Mid-Autumn?\n\nIn the city of Jiaoru, with friends of shared virtue,\nBeneath the Phoenix Towers, we gather for the Mid-Autumn festival.\nThe fragrant wine is drained, and the guests depart,\nYet the moonlight and ripples still vie in brilliance.\n\nOnly when life is understood can one speak of constancy,\nOnly when nature is known can one discuss great plans.\nThis long river flows day and night without cease—\nFor whom is it driven so relentlessly eastward?\n\n**Cheng Ming Yin**\nConfucius was born with knowledge, not through study,\nMencius had prior insight, yet still needed cultivation.\nSincerity and clarity are our family’s own affairs—\nWhy do men of today seek them elsewhere?\n\n**Sheng Shui Yin**\nWater excels at leveling but not at straightening,\nThe plumb line excels at straightening but not at leveling.\nIf water and plumb line could be made one,\nWhat in the world would remain unclear?\n\n**Xin Suan Yin**\nPungent and sour are not the central flavors,\nHow can *shang* and *zheng* be the proper tones?\nThe world cannot distinguish right from wrong—\nWho then can serve as master to calm the heart?\n\n**Ji Mo Yin**\nWhen silence is called for, speech is but dust,\nWhen speech is called for, silence is but grime.\nIf one neither speaks nor stays silent as the moment demands,\nHow can dust and grime ever touch the self?\n\n**Idle Musings on Life**\nNot a trace of heavenly truth is lost,\nYet a thousand measures of human emolument are hard to come by.\nIn this age of peace, I have no other joy—\nOnly wine, three or five cups from time to time.\n\nBamboo rain chills the air as it soaks one through,\nBy the southern window, I wake from sleep and gaze toward Xiaoxiang.\nThe thatched eaves drip without cease—\nI recall the nights spent aboard boats long ago.\n\nAt first light, the moon emerges from the pines,\nIn the height of summer, the wind comes from the water’s surface.\nI have more than most men already—\nHow much more when I can raise my cup again and again?\n\nMy mother in the hall is over eighty,\nBefore the steps, my children laugh and call to one another.\nFine foods are taken as they come, in plenty or in want—\nIs there any joy in the world to match this?\n\nFor three days in a row, I rarely lack pure delight,\nThough deep drinking never exceeds five parts.\nWhen we meet, our hearts hold no other matter—\nWe do not debate rise and fall, only discuss literature.\n\nFlowers and trees mark the seasons with their scenes,\nA thousand volumes of classics are called my livelihood.\nIf anyone asks where I dwell in idleness,\nIt is the first house in the Morality Ward.\n\n**Cooling in the Small Pavilion of Heavenly Palace**\nFrom the small pavilion, I gaze out over Luoyang,\nThe river and sky’s expanse cradles the divine capital.\nWinds come from the peak of Ten-Thousand-Year Mountain—\nHow many mists and clouds share this clarity?\n\nThe small pavilion has done me great service,\nIts coolness unmatched in all of Luoyang.\nAshamed of my own insignificance and good fortune,\nMy sleeves and lapels forever hold the winds of a thousand *li*.\n\nHow rare it is to bear the pavilion’s cool breeze—\nIts mood is that of the ancient sages.\nIn Luoyang lives a nameless guest\nWho for twenty years has enjoyed this coolness.\n\n**Idle Musings in a Stifling Summer Retreat**\nMen find the Heavenly Ford distant,\nThey must come with purpose.\nIn leisure, I know the Way is at peace,\nIn stillness, I feel my spirit open.\n\nI grasp the *Yi* while watching a game of chess,\nDiscuss poetry while toying with a wine cup.\nThe world’s affairs take a thousand forms—\nNone of them trouble my heart.\n\n**Visiting Longmen**\nThe river and sky show little difference,\nA solitary bird descends to the sunlit sands.\nThe road ahead cuts through the mountain’s shape,\nThe river bends where the ferry crossing slants.\n\nCaves and cliffs stand empty by the thousands,\nTwo or three households make up the inns.\nThe clear scenery is fine in all four seasons—\nHow much more so when the capital is not far off?\n\n**Returning to the Luo River**\nTo buy stone is to have clouds in abundance,\nTo buy a mountain is to follow the water.\nClouds can bring about a mind without intent,\nWater can serve as a mirror to still the self.\n\nNature is made clear by a mind without intent,\nFeelings are stilled by the mirror’s reflection.\nNeither can be lost—\nOne emerges from the other.\n\n**Watching Fish by the River**\nThe air is cold with autumn’s touch,\nThe river long, the fish at play.\nThough they know how to avoid the net,\nThey still fear swallowing the hook by mistake.\n\nThey have given up hope of leaping the dragon gate,\nNo longer worry about striking their heads.\nI think of the joy by the Hao River—\nZhuang Zhou’s carefree spirit alone understands.\n\n*The Fourth Volume of Yi Chuan Ji Rang Concludes*\n*The Fifth Volume of Yi Chuan Ji Rang Begins*\n\n**Three Poems on Immediate Matters in the Rear Garden**\n*Jia You Eighth Year*\n\nIn this age of peace, though old, what care have I?\nI wander my home’s garden at leisure, free.\nA few willows cast their shade, just now entwined,\nA few birds sing softly, their voices soon stilled.\n\nBamboo crowds the old path, rising high and low,\nWater fills the spring channels, flowing left and right.\nIf you ask what joy the master finds here—\nHe answers: no different from a marquis’ life.\n\nNature nurtures my indolence, and I know its way,\nIn Luoyang, I’ve claimed my share of water and cloud.\nI hear no worldly storms, no treacherous waves,\nOnly the long days and months within my winecup.\n\nA game of chess detains a wandering guest,\nA few cups of fine wine face the tall bamboo.\nWhen all worldly matters are seen through—\nEven Yan Hui’s seated oblivion seems no more.\n\n---\n\nIn recent years, my illness is called \"poetic madness,\"\nEach bout of madness must be met with wine.\nMy heart delights in the Dao, careless of restraint,\nMy words flow freely, unburdened by thought.\n\nFriends grow closer with time, our bonds endure,\nLike clouds and water, our leisure runs deep.\nNow I understand Yuanming’s profound intent—\nThis window, in his day, rivaled Fuxi’s age.\n\n---\n\n**Watching Chess and Chanting Long**\n\nThe courtyard is still, spring deep, the door ajar,\nBetween bamboo, I watch guests contend at chess.\nThey gather gods and ghosts within their minds,\nArrange rivers and mountains within their grasp.\n\nThe board forms dragons and snakes in battle array,\nThe game ends, geese and crows scatter in flight.\nLike Xiang Yu burying Qin’s soldiers in slaughter,\nOr Fu Jian’s defeat before Jin’s might.\n\nOn the board, spears and shields clash fiercely,\nBefore their eyes, ice and fire swiftly shift.\nLife and death rest on two households’ fate,\nVictory and defeat hinge on a single move.\n\nNo mercy is given where paths cross,\nFacing others, one must feign refusal.\nTo suffer harm in heart is truly dreadful,\nYet even lips and teeth may yet be healed.\n\nTo wound with subtle schemes is called good strategy,\nTo act with cunning in secret is deemed wise.\nLook now upon Chang’an’s roads—\nWho here has not played such games?\n\n---\n\n**Two Poems Ascending Chongde Pavilion on an Autumn Day**\n\nCountless heroes, their ambitions crushed—\nNo need for sighs upon this height.\nMountains and rivers endure after a thousand wars,\nSwords and crowns lie scattered after a hundred years.\n\nSome take glory and fame as their own duty,\nYet who knows if wealth and rank are man’s design?\nPainting and poetry exhaust the world’s wonders,\nBut what meaning lingers when leaning on the railing?\n\n---\n\nA hundred years have been called an age of peace,\nYet still, in the beginning, there was unrest.\nThe capital retains the air of Han and Tang,\nThe palace halls still lack a hegemon’s form.\n\nBeyond the mist, jagged peaks barely emerge,\nAfter frost, half the red trees fade and fall.\nWine in the cup cannot bring drunkenness—\nThe west wind wakes me again and again.\n\n---\n\n**Returning Late After Drinking on an Autumn Day**\n\nWater and bamboo, gardens in autumn—how fine!\nHow could I bear to pour the fragrant wine so soon?\nThe Double Ninth has passed, chrysanthemums just bloom,\nMy heart is full, yet I’ve not learned to age with time.\n\nStill clouds, drooping willows,\nThe wind carries a light chill, hastening dusk.\nBoundless joy cannot be reined—\nMy horse’s hooves tread slowly through the celestial streets.\n\n---\n\n**Sent to Prefect Zu of Shaan, Gentleman of the Palace Zu Zezhi**\n\nDo you recall our meeting?\nBack then, in the eastern seas.\nA thousand miles apart since we parted,\nTen years have slipped by in an instant.\n\nOur paths differ, our names differ,\nYet our hearts are one, our years the same.\nI hope we may meet again in clarity,\nTo share poetry and wine without end.\n\n---\n\n**Lament for Zhang Yuanbo, Director of the Bureau of Operations**\n\nIn recent years, the old guard has fallen one by one,\nStirring sorrow deep within me.\nOf those who hung their caps in Luoyang and retired—\nOnly you were as pure as a transcendent.\n\nOnce we debated who was elder, who younger,\nNow we vie to see who follows whom.\nI pour wine to you—you must know—\nFor you, I shed tears before the west wind.\n\n---\n\n**Lament for Zhang Shirou, Section Chief**\n\nAll his life, he longed to establish merit and fame,\nWho said talent must contend with fate?\nHis final poem expressed refined intent,\nHis coffin closed, but our friendship remained.\n\nThe affairs of the world in his heart—how to unfold them?\nThe realm’s talents will not be judged again.\nIf his spirit knows, he may find solace—\nHis descendants are more than capable of restoring the family name.\n\n---\n\n**Matching the Rhymes of Pei, Vice Magistrate of Dengfeng, Sent in the Renzi Year**\n\nThe tale of the narrow lane and bamboo bowl is well known,\nYet who am I to feel shame at such simplicity?\nSince wealth and rank must come by fate,\nWhy ask heaven about rise or fall?\n\nSilence and stillness cultivate my wild nature,\nNo path to soar like the sages of the age.\nThose who come and go through golden gates—\nShould they laugh at this old man tending his stony fields?\n\n---\n\n**Why Do You Send Poems to the Three Wealthy Lords of the Three Cities?**\n\nWhy do you urge me to ponder so deeply,\nTo seek transcendence with these few words?\nYour actions should be like a thousand-catty crossbow,\nYour tempering should be like a hundred-fold refined gold.\n\nFishing in water, you wield the power of life and death,\nPlaying chess, you stir the heart of war.\nA cup of fine wine may bring some relief—\nIn the grove, I pour myself a drink from time to time.\n\n---\n\n**Letter Written on Behalf of a Friend**\n\nIn my youth, I aspired to stand above the world,\nReading ancient texts, I laughed at Xie An.\nWho would have thought this body would grow old and useless,\nWith no idle ground to linger?\n\nAt chess, I meet worthy opponents, moves worth making,\nBut the zither lacks a knowing ear—I will not play.\nNot only am I unworthy to withdraw in silence—\nThe ancients long lamented the rarity of opportunity.\n\n---\n\n**Visiting Yao Fuzhou, Vice Director of the Bureau of Evaluations, at Moon Dyke’s Western Garden**\n\nLonging could not be restrained,\nSo I came to visit you on West Street.\nCrossing ditches, winding through vegetable plots,\nTrees bow their heads to make way,\nMy staff changes hands as I climb.\n\nAmong friends, our joy is complete—\nWhat greater happiness could there be?\n\n---\n\n**Matching Rhymes in Thanks to Three Gentlemen of Dengfeng—Liu, Li, and Pei—for Inviting Me to Tour the Mountains**\n\nThe gentlemen invite me to Mount Song,\nEach composing new poems in turn.\nI shake off the dust, not daring to lag behind,\nYet in seeking clouds and water, I fear I’ve fallen behind.\n\nSanyang Palace lies near clusters of dark stones,\nWansui Peak towers, veiled in purple mist.\nSo many scenic spots I’ve yet to visit—\nI long to follow the immortals’ footsteps and climb together.\n\n---\n\n**Ascending the Summit of Mount Song**\n\nThe nine provinces stretch far like a chessboard,\nWansui Peak stands tall, gazing upon peace.\nIf one man can govern the four seas,\nWhy should the Central Plains know strife again?\n\nI long fear the rise of treacherous heroes,\nYet wish to be a simple subject of Yao and Shun.\nFifty-three years have passed in idle obscurity—\nNow, at last, I rejoice to see the spring plowing.\n\n---\n\n**Viewing Shaoshi Temple in Dengfeng County**\n\n**The Primordial Mountain**\n\nWhen heaven and earth first congealed,\nThis mountain already stood at its loftiest height.\nPeaks cluster like banners and pennants,\nMighty stones arrayed like swords and halberds.\nAt sunrise, the cliffs blush crimson first;\nAfter rain, the mist glows an even deeper jade.\nWho knows if immortals dwell here,\nLong concealed within these hidden traces?\n\n---\n\n**Written in the Mountains, Sent to the Magistrate of Dengfeng**\n\nNo sooner had I left the county than I planned to stay the night,\nYet once in the mountains, I could not bear to turn back.\nIf the magistrate’s hall were free of civic affairs,\nI would bring my tea set and ascend the peaks.\n\n---\n\n**Sent to Longtu of Zhengzhou, Zu Zezhi, on My Return to Luoyang**\n\nKindness runs deep as marrow—such is a loving parent;\nLoyalty weighs heavy as mountains—such are old friends.\nPassing through Songyang, the old haunts of my wanderings,\nWhite clouds enfold this body clad in vines and creepers.\n\n---\n\n**In Response to Longtu’s Gift**\n\nMy family’s duty is to the clouds and mountains—\nWithout clouds and mountains, my face knows no ease.\nThe urge to wander cannot be bound by days or limits,\nEven in dreams, my soul does not descend to the human realm.\nMists and peaks promise boundless joy,\nWhile courtly caps and carriages offer but fleeting leisure.\nThough I often think of gathering with friends in Luoyang,\nWhen have I ever found time to climb even a little?\n\n---\n\n**On Ornamented Verses**\n\nWhen adorned verses are perfected, one is called a master,\nYet the craftsmanship seems that of a true artisan.\nBeware the cold-eyed observer’s gaze—\nFor puppets have no curtains to hide behind.\n\n---\n\n**Self-Reflection, Three Poems**\n\nIn the arena of fame and profit, it’s hard to plant one’s feet;\nOn the path to forests and springs, I turned back early.\nHad I not, this fifty-year-old, worn-out body\nWould still be tossed in the ceaseless winds and waves.\n\nThe sky’s wind and moon are my official charge,\nThe earth’s clouds and mountains my true authority.\nOnly I dare open my unguarded mouth,\nSpeaking freely to others without restraint.\n\nEver regretful my nature was dull and I heard the Dao late,\nEver ashamed my wisdom was shallow and the times unsuited.\nA human life spans thirty-six thousand days—\nFor twenty thousand of them, this body has been at ease.\n\n---\n\n**Casual Jottings**\n\nOpinions pour forth from every quarter—\nWhere are the true Confucians among the gentry?\nThe teachings of names and rites have always had their masters;\nAcross the ten thousand *li* of the Central Plains, are there truly no men?\n\nKings, emperors, lords, and earls—though their eras differed,\nRites, music, and the classics renewed the Dao in their own time.\nGazing at the past, so much is visible today—\nYet who knows what is meant by \"statecraft\"?\n\n---\n\n**Letter in Place of Writing to Magistrate Chen Chengbo of Shangluo**\n\nHalf a year remains before your term ends,\nYet Shangshan is remote and poor, with few skilled physicians.\nGrief and sorrow may stagnate the *qi* after loss—\nChen Chengbo mourns his wife—\nWhile summer damp breeds illness all too easily.\nEven sages and wise men cannot escape misfortune;\nThe worthy alone know how to navigate sorrow and honor.\nThese words are simple, but their principle is not—\nMay they offer some small aid to a hero’s wisdom.\n\n---\n\n**Mid-Autumn of the Dingwei Year of the Zhiping Era: Traveling the Two Rivers of Yi and Luo**\n\n**Sixth Day: Evening Departure from the West Gate of Luoyang, Lodging at a Monastery to Honor My Parents, Listening to Daoist Zhang Play the Zither**\n\nAs dusk fell, I drove my carriage out of Shangyang,\nBeginning my journey by lodging in a land of water and clouds.\nThen hearing several strains of an immortal’s melody,\nI at last believed that within a gourd, days and months stretch long.\n\n---\n\n**Seventh Night: Ascending the Luo River, Lodging at Yanzhuang**\n\nThe eighth month, Yanzhuang’s grain ripens under autumn skies,\nFor farming families, wealth lies in a bountiful year.\nA basket of millet, a gourd of wine—\nWho envies the lords who feast on ten thousand coins?\n\n---\n\n**Eighth Day: Crossing the Luo, Ascending South Mountain, Visiting the Spouting Jade Spring; Magistrates Zhang and Zhao of Shou’an County Join the Excursion**\n\nCrossing the Luo to view the Spouting Jade Spring,\nA thousand peaks, ten thousand peaks stretch into the distance.\nBetween them, a single stream, long as snow,\nPlunges into the icy pool, its age forgotten.\n\n---\n\n**Ninth Day: Ascending Jinping Mountain in Shou’an County, Lodging in the Town**\n\nA cluster of mist and haze rises steeply—\nArriving here, the heart naturally stills.\nAbove dwell immortals whose names are unknown,\nAs the cave gate idly opens to drifting white clouds.\n\nRiding side by side, we traverse Die Stone Creek,\nWhere sheer cliffs encircle us, level with the clouds.\nEven the cascading waters seem to urge us to stay—\nHow could we betray our vow to dwell here one day?\n\n*(Die Stone Creek lies five or six* li *south of the county.)*\n\n---\n\n**Tenth Day: Westward Passage over Yongji Bridge (a Tang Dynasty Bridge)**\n\nOn the tenth day, traveling west over Yongji,\nLight rain dampens my robes from time to time.\nThe mountain spirits, in their kindness, seem to understand—\nFearing that travelers might miss the verdant peaks.\n\n---\n\n**Two Poems on Passing Yiyang City**\n\nSix states, petty and weak, served Qin,\nExhausted by their running, yet still unable to please.\nHow could they slaughter half the realm,\nAs if the lands east of the Pass had no men left?\n\nIn those days, Yiyang was called a secondary capital—\nYet how could the state of Han have been so small?\nZhang Liang could not vent his lingering resentment,\nSo at Bolangsha, he struck the wrong carriage.\n\n---\n\n**Eleventh Day: Meeting Rain in Fuchang County**\n\nClouds shift slowly over the peaks,\nThe sound of springs lingers among the bamboo.\nAt this moment, boundless meaning—\nOnly the green-feathered birds know.\n\n---\n\n**Matching Rhymes with the Magistrate and Deputy of Du’an, Who Sent a Poem**\n\nNot once have I lashed my horse into the red dust,\nFor I possess no talent worthy of the age’s favor.\nMy youthful ambitions have all come to naught—\nYet fate draws me to dwell in the green mountains.\n\nIn the shade of emerald bamboo, I open my silk-bound books;\nAmid piles of white clouds, I bow to cascading springs.\nJinping Mountain faces Nanxi Stream—\nOne day, I shall wander there with you, my friend.\n\n---\n\n**Twelfth Day: Accompanying Magistrate Wang of Fuchang, a Gentleman of the Imperial Secretariat, to Dragon Pool**\n\n*(The pool lies in South Mountain, fifteen* li *from the county.)*\n\nTwo pools, cold and dark, lap at the black cliff’s base,\nSeveral peaks rise high into the azure sky-road.\nVisitors hold their breath, daring not speak,\nEver fearful that thunder might erupt beside them.\n\nSitting quietly by the water as dusk approaches,\nI linger, unable to leave.\nTurning my horse’s head for one last look,\nLayers of clouds and mist already separate us.\n\n---\n\n**Thirteenth Day: Visiting Shangsi Monastery North of the County and Huangjian West of the County**\n\nTo leave the dusty world is to enter the true realm;\nTo fail to finish with the monastic life is to remain in the secular.\nIf not here, where shall I seek the grotto-heavens?\nWhere else shall I find hidden blossoms?\n\nAlas for the Five Hegemons who fought over Zhou’s embers,\nLaughable the Three Kingdoms who scavenged Han’s remnants.\nHow much better to sit idly, untalented,\nWhile clouds and waters keep my robes at a distance.\n\n---\n\n**Fourteenth Day: Inscribed on the Eastern Pavilion of Fuchang County’s Hall**\n\nAutumn enters the Luo River, the scene at its finest,\nLight rain has just passed, the paths lie aslant.\nWithin the bamboo-and-water grotto hides the county hall,\nWhile mist and haze enfold the homes of the people.\n\nFrost-touched leaves, red amid a thousand layers,\nBeyond the sky, a few wisps of sunset glow.\nShallow or deep, the creek shimmers clear and bright,\nPeaks high or low stand jagged in jade.\n\nBirds choose their trees and fly far,\nClouds drift without intent, their departure slow.\n\n**On Worldly Glory**\n\nVast worldly merit and fame often clash,\nOutstanding talent and deeds invite sighs.\nThe floating life of sun and moon must still be cherished,\nHalf-aged sinews and bones—boast no more.\n\nHere by this cliff, a hut should be built,\nTo delight in my true joy, boundless and free.\n\n---\n\n**Fifteenth Day: Parting from Fuchang, with Some Feelings**\n\nThe Lianchang Palace lies ruined, the Chang River remains,\nEvents fade, times shift, words drift idly on.\nBelow stands a desolate shrine, hard to inquire of—\nAncient locust trees stand bare, bamboos pierce the sky.\n\n---\n\n**That Evening, Lodging Below Jinping Mountain**\n\nThe moon is ever lovely to behold,\nYet never so perfectly round as tonight.\nI suspect the White Maiden eases some old regret,\nMeeting me here before Jinping’s peaks.\n\n---\n\n**Sixteenth Day: Responding in Rhyme to the Magistrate of Fuchang’s Gift**\n\nDao and righteousness bring joy—how rare the bond,\nAs the ancients said, knowing others is hard.\nLiterature does not bind the men of court and market,\nHonor and disgrace touch not the cloud-and-water self.\n\nWords delve deeply into the patterns of things,\nSpeech leaves no trace, all is natural truth.\nOne day, when the Luoyang fellowship gathers,\nOur records will add yet another neighbor.\n\n---\n\n**Seventeenth Day: At Jinping Mountain, Thanking Messrs. Zhang and Sun of the City for Their Gift of Tea**\n\nMountains like indigo waves, waters like dye,\nA single line of thought resists all restraint.\nStill bearing the tea shared by my two friends,\nI brew it where mist and haze run deepest.\n\n---\n\n**Evening View at Shou’an County**\n\nNo need to sigh over life’s glory or disgrace,\nJust listen all day to the murmuring stream.\nA lone goose vanishes through the dusk’s haze,\nTwo egrets slice the wild mist on their return.\n\nFine trees stand like aged ranks below green cliffs,\nLovely peaks encircle the county in emerald.\nThey say those who slight fame and gain come here,\nStealing moments from time’s relentless flow.\n\n---\n\n**Eighteenth Day: Crossing the Sheep-Dragging Slope, Southward to the Tomb in Yi River**\n\nA three-foot barrow, a hundred-foot hill,\nWhere a mother’s love for her child lies buried.\nThis love, even in death, knows no end—\nAt dusk, I linger and turn back again.\n\n---\n\n**Thoughts on the Cheng Family—Father, Sons, and Brothers—Sent to Them**\n\nYear after year, the season nears mid-autumn,\nFine waters, fine mountains, radiant in play.\nThis time, my return is hastened for you,\nNo lingering longer by the Yi River.\n\nThe climate is as it was that day,\nThe mountains and streams seem as of old.\nAlone I come, alone I go—\nWho understands this feeling?\n\n---\n\n**Nineteenth Day: Returning to Luoyang, Passing Longmen**\n\nTo and from Yi River, I cross Dragon Mountain,\nEach crossing leaves my mind at ease.\nDo not say the scene fails to move the heart—\nHow can one bear the grip of profit and fame?\n\nNo need for external things to toy with the spirit,\nWorldly ways are ever fickle, ever fond of the new.\nOnly the fine wind and moon before the steps remain—\nTheir pure light still belongs to the idle.\n\n---\n\n**Inscribed at Longmen**\n\nFused and formed, the years forgotten,\nSheer cliffs and green walls lock in misty sorrow.\nHalf the great creation is Xia’s kingly labor,\nThe Yi River’s flow cuts through the mighty mountain.\n\nThe Eight Rapids’ roar lingers in the ear,\nA river’s scenery all gathers in the pavilion.\nTravelers, do not stir your railing-longing—\nCountless heroes have idly whitened their heads.\n\n---\n\n**Who wielded the long sword to slay the long flood-dragon?**\nThe dragon slain, the sword sheathed once more.\nClaws and tail coil, congealing into Hua Peak,\nFangs and tusks fierce, knotting into Song’s heights.\n\nWounds scar two places on the sheer green cliffs,\nBlood gushes eastward in surging waves.\nEven this beast could not preserve its head and tail—\nBeware the clamor of slanderous tongues.\n\n---\n\n**Viewing Yi River from the Stone Pavilion at Longmen**\n\nFor days I’ve wandered freely through mist and haze,\nLeaning on the railing, gazing at the splendor.\nA hundred-foot tower reaches the birds’ path,\nA river of mist and water belongs to the monks.\n\nOnly when the heart is at ease is there true joy,\nOnly then does official glory lose its boast.\nTo roam such scenes on carefree days—\nKnow then that happiness knows no bounds.\n\n---\n\n**Twentieth Day: Returning to the City, Meeting Old Friends**\n\nYear after year, I wander through mist and haze,\nYet who has ever called me greedy?\nReturning, I meet old friends to speak of pure delight—\nNo need to guard against misfortune with triple-sealed lips.\n\n---\n\n**Twenty-Second Day: Evening Stroll at Tianjin Bridge; Next Day’s Poem**\n\nLast night, an old man strolled to Tianjin,\nPausing often where the bridge stands.\nThe Luo River’s waters only hear the departing oars,\nThe west wind merely hastens the traveler’s steps.\n\nMountains and streams grow somber under cold rain,\nTowers and terraces rise uneven, veiled in dusk’s clouds.\nWho truly grasps this scene’s clarity?\nWhen frost threatens, the wild geese arrive as guests.\n\n---\n\n**Twenty-Fifth Day: Responding in Rhyme to Wu Chuanzheng, Vice-Director of the Left Treasury**\n\nThe light and scenery of Shangyang are fine for reading,\nBeyond appearances lies a level path.\nA fair moon guides the return at Fragrant Grass Ford,\nA swift wind flies past Dongting Lake.\n\nWere it not for frequent journeys to the Red Waters,\nHow could there be daily joy in the Yellow Sprouts?\nDo not say Tianjin Bridge holds no affairs—\nEven in leisure, one must apply effort.\n\n*(His poem said: \"From now on, the scenes south of Tianjin Bridge / Shall not all belong to Shao Yaofu.\" Hence these lines.)*\n\n---\n\n**Twenty-Ninth Day: Responding in Rhyme to Lu Gangshu, Registrar of Luoyang**\n\nA sudden shower, late rain’s rustling remains,\nBy Phoenix Tower, I chance to drive my cart.\nXie Shen’s jade fragment—who can hold it?\nLe Guang’s blue sky—how fortunate it stays unobstructed.\n\nLong parted through summer and autumn, what news?\nBy lamplight, what books do you read?\nI regret having no silks to reward Master Cheng—\nVainly I fret and return to my humble hut.\n\n---\n\n*Yichuan Jirang Collection, Volume Five Concludes*\n*Yichuan Jirang Collection, Volume Six*\n\n**For Zhou Shiyan, Magistrate of Pu’an in Jianzhou, Written on Behalf of Shao Yaofu of Yichuan**\n\nTo serve as an official—why sigh for what use?\nNo ascent to heights but begins in humility.\nThe noble man’s bending and stretching is the Dao itself;\nWe Confucians prize advance and retreat as circumstance allows.\n\nEven now, where is Pengze’s return?\nYet the eastern gate’s departure may still come in time.\nI grieve that the scenes of Yi and Song remain boundless—\nA single name, a fine place, yet I seek further emolument.\n\nFrom Shu to the Three Wu, the distance spans ten thousand li.\nLast year, I gazed north; this year, I drive west again.\nJian’ge scrapes the sky and sun;\nQin’s plains bar the imperial capital.\n\nFacing the wind where we recall each other—\nCould you drink a cup with me?\n\n---\n\n**Another Quatrain**\n\nJust when elders should gather in fellowship,\nThe high autumn arrives, desolate and bare.\nA handful of yellow blossoms, a flagon of wine—\nA year has passed since my old friend went west.\n\n---\n\n**In Response to Secretary Zhao Chongde’s Gift**\n\nPeople say official life endangers cap and crown;\nI cherish my life, far from market and court.\nMy rustic face cannot bear rushing to the Wei gates;\nMy idle self is fit only to visit Yang and Liao.\n\nThough my poems lack discipline, a thousand verses remain;\nThough rich in clouds and mountains, I have but a gourd of wine.\nI dread the carriage’s eastward departure—\nFrom now on, how can I summon the wind and moon?\n\n---\n\n**In Response to Director Wang Buyi’s Gift**\n\nFor twenty years I have dwelt in Luoyang,\nWatching the world’s affairs swirl like dust.\nMy form is no more than grass and trees, wild and untrammeled;\nMy heart resembles an ancient bell or tripod, empty yet resonant.\n\nI have bathed in the benevolent breeze to my very marrow;\nNow I marvel at the poetry’s brilliance, like jade and jewels.\nDo not let Zhuang Zhou say names and realities are flawed—\nIt is simply that I lack talent and delight the crowd of monkeys.\n\n---\n\n**In Response to Professor Wei’s Gift**\n\nIn this pure age, literature hangs like sun and moon;\nThough talentless, I am fortunate to enjoy abundant years.\nI wander Mount Tai’s Greater and Lesser Chambers;\nI gaze upon the Yi River and the Luo.\n\nOf old, Mencius found enlightenment hard to speak of;\nIn this age, without Yanzi, who is deemed worthy?\nEach time I read to the root of heaven,\nI fear the masters will ask of the profoundest mysteries.\n\n---\n\n**In Response to Vice Minister Wu Chongqing’s Gift**\n\nNon-being and being are the ancestral homeland,\nYet all things differ by a hair’s breadth.\nEvery person may reach it, though I have not;\nNo thing obstructs—who could hinder whom?\n\nLost, liver and spleen become Chu and Yue;\nGained, coarse greens become fine millet.\nA single word, through the ages, is hard to fathom—\nIts wondrous workings must be seen at Lüliang.\n\n---\n\n**In Response to Instructor Sun Chuanshi’s Gift**\n\nSouth of Tianjin Bridge stands my humble hut,\nWhere you, my lord, deign to visit by carriage.\nSince retiring, I have forgotten restraint;\nFrom long idleness, my learning has grown hollow.\n\nBetter to inscribe my name in history’s annals—\nOr should I bear plain books and face the clouds and mountains?\nA single piece of sincere devotion is hardest to describe;\nPerhaps I may yet resemble the Red and Void.\n\n---\n\n**In Rhyme for the Longevity Snow Gathering with Academician Chen Chengbo**\n\nThe garden’s flowers renew in a single night;\nJade Terrace’s twelve peaks turn to dust.\nIn the city, bamboo-leaf wine surges in price;\nAt the feast, willow catkins vie to learn spring.\n\nThe Liang Garden gathering draws all the inked guests—\nWho recalls the divine beings of Guye?\nMy surplus grain need not fill a thousand granaries;\nEven a foot’s depth of snow should not be spurned for its frequency.\n\n---\n\n**In Rhyme for the Garden Gathering at the Historiography Bureau, Composed on the Spot**\n\nBamboo reaches high, pines encircle the pavilion—\nWho comes here feels their bones and hair grow pure.\nPlum branches, laden with snow, barely crack open;\nWater veins, linked to ice, murmur in their flow.\n\nThe year’s end in late winter stirs inescapable feeling;\nHalf-drunk, my sleeves cannot contain my emotion.\nWho pities the late Chancellor’s empty name?\nHow can our Dao be put into practice?\n\n---\n\n**On Zhang Xian of Kuixia’s “Remembering the Past at Baidi City”**\n\nNo need to resent Cao’s rise in Xuchang—\nHad it not been for Liang and Yi, none could contend for the throne.\nThe realm divided, wind and thunder raged;\nCutting across the southwest, his might was unmatched.\n\nTravelers come and go, idly pointing;\nHistorians praise and blame in their reckless prose.\nLater generations fail to grasp the meaning of rise and fall—\nLook upon the old battleground in the river’s heart.\n\n---\n\n**Leisurely Verses, First Year of Xining (1068)**\n\nFortunate is the scholar who lives in a flourishing age,\nWhose home, though tiled, lies in the central capital.\nFleeting fame and hollow profit are not mine;\nGreen waters and blue mountains—where are they not found?\n\nTo choose a fine site, seek the fairest scenes;\nTo choose companions, select those who suit you.\nJoy in idleness is the idle man’s affair—\nYet it differs from stealing moments of leisure.\n\n---\n\nA six-foot frame, content in the present;\nHow can I bear to waste the four seasons’ fair days?\nIn the second and eighth months, the weather shifts between warmth and chill;\nWith three or five friends, we discuss the Dao and righteousness.\n\nMeasure your strength in cups and plates, set out simple fare;\nOpen your heart to laughter and speech, follow nature’s truth.\nI urge you: in such clear and idle matters,\nThough old, why grow weary of their frequency?\n\n---\n\nDo not let true qi aid sorrow and grief—\nThe indignant death of heroes only lengthens the age.\nThough many horses leap on the paths,\nBeyond the heavens, phoenixes soar.\n\nThree thousand guests may polish their jade edges;\nA hundred and two mountains may bear sword points.\nAll is but a spring dream passing—\nWhat else is worth lamenting?\n\n---\n\n**Awakening from Sleep by the South Window, Gazing at the Spring Mountains**\n\nWaking from sleep by the south window, I gaze at the spring mountains—\nAmid the mountains, mist and sleet mingle with haze.\nA thousand li cannot escape the clarity of these two eyes;\nIn a hundred years, I have not seen a single idle man.\n\nEmotions are like falling catkins, without high or low;\nThe heart is like wandering silk, drifting to and fro.\nI fear the hidden birds know this feeling—\nThus they come to the branches, murmuring softly.\n\n---\n\n**Who Has Entrusted Creation to the East Wind?**\n\nWho has entrusted creation to the east wind?\nOnce given to the east wind, affairs know no end.\nLate winter should prepare its plans;\nNew Year’s dawn must demand its achievements.\n\nWillow tips, warmed, sway gently;\nPlum buds, stealing spring, half-reveal their red.\nIf only the feelings of those times remained—\nLight robes fluttering amid the carefree young.\n\n---\n\n**Peach and Plum Verses**\n\nPeach and plum, stirred by the wind, fill the branches with blossoms;\nStirred by the wind, peach and plum scatter apart.\nSorrow and joy follow one another, never leaving my grasp;\nWorry and delight both reside in my brows.\n\nWhen prosperity reaches its peak, it must decline;\nWhen adversity reaches its nadir, it must turn.\nLet men of today cease to praise the ancients—\nIt is only because men of today were born too late.\n\n---\n\n**Heartbreaking Song**\n\nI know not what iron was forged into this needle—\nOnce forged, it pierces only the heart.\nI reckon the human heart is no more than an inch—\nWhen piercing, it must pierce to the fullest depth.\n\n---\n\n**Lament for Two Younger Brothers Who Passed Without Illness**\n\nThe love between siblings runs deep, unforgettable;\nEven cutting out my heart cannot compare to this grief.\n\n**In Times of Urgent Need**\n\nIn times of urgent need, you once aided me—\nYet now, who stands beside me in this hour?\nThe radiant *di* flowers bloom without peer,\nWhile geese in flight break rank, their formation torn.\n\nFrom this night of moonlit winds and clarity,\nI gaze in desolation at the eastern fence—my heart breaks.\nMy two brothers lie buried beneath its boughs;\nLater, I found his poem from the Double Ninth:\n*\"Clothes white as the moon of yore,\nFlowers yellow as the years before.\"*\nI sought to ask the eastern fence of its tale,\nBut the fence’s tale had faded into mist—\nA language like an omen.\n\nWhere now to seek the eastern fence, my heart undone?\nFrom this day forth, its story sinks into silence.\nWhere once we walked abreast, all has passed away;\nNo sorrow now compares to this.\n\nTears have dried, yet grief knows no bound,\nThough the Yellow Springs lie not so deep.\nHow many days must pass ere it fades—\nThirty-two years of harmony and kinship?\n\n---\n\n**Another Poem**\n\nMy elder brother named *Yong*, my younger *Mu*—\nBrothers in harmony, yet was our bond enough?\nIn daily life, one always stayed behind,\nServing our parents, raising children as they wished.\nOur kind father lived to seventy-nine,\nFour young sons ever at his side.\nDo you recall the days we played in bright robes,\nWhile joy filled the hall, so full it could be cupped?\n\nTwo years ago, our father suddenly passed,\nAnd this year, your life was cut short too.\nNow a lone son attends our mother with four young ones,\nEach day facing the ancestral altar, weeping face to face.\nHow many *li* of intestines must I have,\nHow many *hu* of tears must I shed?\nAll spent, all shed—what can I do?\nThe sunlight of past kindness—how can it be repaid?\n\n---\n\n**A Quatrain**\n\nThe bond of siblings runs deep,\nThe joy of *xun* and *chi* long.\nTo know where it may be forgotten,\nSee the weeds upon their graves.\n\n---\n\n**Hearing the Cuckoo, Thinking of My Deceased Brother**\n\nI recall last year’s early summer,\nWhen we listened together to the cuckoo’s cry.\nThis year, the cuckoo returns again—\nIt is still the same early summer as before.\n\nEven birds know the depth of human longing:\nOne cry has not ceased before another begins in sorrow.\nMy heart, following this sound, is already broken—\nMy soul, chasing this bird, where does it fly?\n\n---\n\n**Inscription for My Deceased Brother Zan**\n\nAfter my coming, before my going.\nAt the moment of departure,\nThere was no yielding between us.\n\n---\n\n**Evening Stroll South of the Southern Garden, Thinking of My Deceased Brother**\n\nSouth of the southern garden, grass like a mat,\nI walk at dusk, the wind clear, no dust in sight.\nUnable to share this joy with you,\nI wonder if the clouds above are drifting from heaven.\n\nA fleeting piece of this world, come to be human,\nDrifting to and fro without cause.\nI pity myself—\n\n---\n\n**Self-Compassion**\n\nHeaven covers all without partiality, ancient and modern the same,\nYet the deep bond of siblings is suddenly emptied.\nFive or seven years of family hardship,\nAt sixty, my head winds still afflict me.\n\nCommon sense cannot escape worldly customs,\nPrivate plans are hard to entrust to servants.\nIf only the immortal’s old raft still remained—\nThe Yi River’s clouds and waters bring boundless joy.\n\n---\n\n**Self-Admonition in the Year Wushen**\n\nThough old, I still long to sing and beat the pot,\nHoping to preserve some measure of Heaven’s harmony.\n*Ming Yi* advises concealment—let it end here;\n*Wu Wang* warns of calamity—what can be done?\n\nTime flies like an arrow from my head,\nHuman affairs pass before my eyes like hemp.\nIf I do not take charge of myself now,\nThe losses to come will be even greater.\n\n---\n\n**Written on Behalf of Zhao Chongdao, Envoy to Beihai, in the Second Year of Xining**\n\nSince I ceased my recitations,\nI have but sung one vast song to the wind.\nParting is easy, reunion hard—my longing knows no end;\nAscending heights, gazing afar—what thoughts arise?\n\nA hundred years are fleeting, time does not return,\nA thousand *li* of longing bring even more cares.\nToday, this cup is truly the North Sea—\nHow many like you, so refined, have passed through?\n\n---\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Wang Buyi, Minister of Rites, in His Gift**\n\nI do not let sorrow burden the splendor of things,\nTime flies past my eyes swift as a chariot.\nFinding joy in contentment, I know my place;\nSeeking sufficiency for peace—when will it end?\n\nAfter meals, I sometimes wander the orchid garden,\nAfter sleep, with nothing to do, I visit the monks.\nThe wind and moon of Tianjin surpass other places—\nI long to share tea with you there.\n\n---\n\n**The Virtuous One’s Song**\n\nThe virtuous are hard to find, their thoughts steadfast;\nIn peace, take care not to presume you are unharmed.\nVying to be first on the path—how treacherous the schemes;\nLingering behind in speech—how rich the flavor.\n\nWhat tastes sharp often breeds illness,\nWhat pleases the heart often brings misfortune.\nBetter to seek medicine before falling ill\nThan to seek it after the disease has struck.\n\n---\n\n**Two Poems: Inviting Guests to Wine as the Early Plum Blossoms Bloom by the Eastern Pavilion**\n\n**I**\nI love the early plum more than the winter plum,\nA few branches blooming first, lingering in the sun.\nIf all on the southern ridges had faded before the year’s end,\nHow could Luoyang boast its blossoms in the new year’s turn?\n\nFragrance follows the warm wind, emerging from the valley,\nBeauty drifts upon the wine, floating in the cup.\nGather noble guests to grasp the Lord of Spring’s intent—\nDo not waste this moment of spring’s arrival.\n\n**II**\nSpring’s warmth fills Luoyang,\nDo not refuse joy to console this fleeting life.\nDeeply cherish wise friends who bring smiles,\nTreasure the plum blossoms shining bright before your eyes.\n\nMoreover, the old mountain hermit is somewhat fond of such things—\nHow pitiful the fragrant wine, so full of feeling!\nIf not drunk before the cup now,\nWhen else to drink to peace?\n\n---\n\n**Long Chant of the Pure Wind**\n\nIn the cosmos, the qi of harmony—\nPure and cool, beyond compare.\nWith the seasons, it dispels illness,\nFor the year, it brings abundant harvests.\n\nRising from the tips of green duckweed,\nComing from beside the emerald trees.\nOn a moonlit night, it meets me,\nThen enters the land of old friends.\n\nDense leaves sway like layered curtains,\nLush flowers dance in bright adornment.\nTwo or three distant flute notes,\nA thousand strands of drooping willows.\n\nSilken zither notes drift softly,\nDeep orchid fragrance lingers long.\nPavilions stand by distant waters,\nTerraces near tall bamboo groves.\n\nIn midsummer, it drives away the heat,\nAfter rain, it brings the evening cool.\nLightly parting green lotus leaves,\nGently penetrating thin robes.\n\nWaves stir sleeves in playful flight,\nRipples rise in glistening cups.\nIdle sorrows cannot cling,\nHidden thoughts take flight.\n\nSwift as riding the heavenly steed,\nSobering as sweet sugarcane juice.\nBefore me, I wander Penglai,\nAt my seat, I drift the Xiao and Xiang.\n\nCannot be bought with gold,\nNor measured by the *dou*.\nRelying wholly on virtue,\nStored without need of granaries.\n\nNo fear of monopolies,\nNo worry of bandits or thieves.\nMaking this my joy,\nI have never known sorrow.\n\n---\n\n**Long Chant of the Weeping Willow**\n\nWeeping willows come in two kinds—\nSome long, some short in their droop.\nOnly this long kind,\nIs most fitting for quietude.\n\n**Long Chant of the Weeping Willow**\n\nDeep in courtyards after spring’s retreat,\nIn pavilions when evening scenes unfold.\nToo frail to bear the mist’s thick shroud,\nHelpless before the lingering sun’s delay.\nA drizzling rain has just passed,\nA crisp, cool breeze now stirs.\n\nBy Zhangtai Street, east and west,\nPillars stand where avenues divide.\nRising eyes meet trees beyond the wall,\nBrushing heads, branches cross the path.\nSwaying like green silk ribbons,\nDrifting as if clad in golden threads.\nTossed and scattered, sunlit catkins fly,\nIn warm winds, tender strands dance bright.\n\nThreads tug at hearts, inch by inch they break,\nCatkins drift into ten thousand homes.\nGraceful as Wang Gong’s bearing,\nSupple as Zhao Feiyan’s sway.\nSlender and fair as young Zhang Xu,\nSoft and delicate as Shen Hou’s frail frame.\nLush and trailing, green sweeps the earth,\nFeathery and fine, jade fringes the pool.\n\nEnhancing blossoms’ fiery glow,\nEnticing grasses’ lush verdure.\nDense, they shroud the mountain lodge,\nSparse, they frame the tavern’s banner.\nGiven to others, all weep in turn,\nHorses neigh as riders pause to gaze.\nShadows swallow the creaking cart,\nBeneath their shade, wheels rumble home.\n\nMournful in the gathering dusk,\nFaint in the slanting light.\nVexed by careless plucking,\nGrieved by weighty partings.\nPrematurely withered, green lines the road,\nFirst to flourish where streams run near.\nBeyond the tower, cicadas just begin their cry,\nBy the bridge, orioles sing again.\n\nHating how they block the distant view,\nLoathing how they mimic painted brows.\nWandering strangers, countless in number,\nWhich long branch once bound whom?\nFrost-withered, all grow gaunt,\nYet next year, they’ll sway anew.\n\n---\n\n**Long Chant of Falling Flowers**\n\nWith wine, I battle flowers’ lushness,\nFlowers’ lushness makes the wine run deeper.\nFlowers fade in ten days’ time,\nYet not a hundred jars of wine are drained.\nStill gladdened by petals clinging to sleeves,\nStill cherishing those fallen into cups.\n\nOnly butterflies are truly passionate,\nBees are but fickle lovers.\nDiminished, the radiance on the wall,\nEnhanced, the crimson along the path.\nScattered through the deep courtyard,\nAdorning the quiet lattice.\n\nYet I fear they’ll follow the flowing stream,\nStill dread they’ll wed the distant wind.\nWater flows, ever winding,\nWind blows, now east, now west.\nTattered after late spring’s end,\nScattered in the fading light.\n\nThough pavilions have their masters,\nNo trace remains of galloping steeds.\nSwords depart with favored consorts,\nArmies besiege Shi Chong’s halls.\nAt Mawei, lingering regrets,\nAt Jingu, all is haste.\n\nCao Zhi’s verses grow ever poignant,\nKing Xiang’s dream has reached its end.\nFalsely they speak of seeking the Luo River’s shores,\nIdly they tell of counting Wu Mountain’s peaks.\nSwallows still voice their grievances,\nOrioles fail to carry messages.\n\nIf moss-coins could buy them back,\nWillow threads might mend their fate.\nGazing in vain at the true arbiter,\nMournful, I rail at nature’s craft.\nLet them bloom in wild abandon,\nNever granted even a moment’s grace.\n\nMy heart resists the sweeping broom,\nWords fail, my plans are spent.\nExquisite fragrance consumes the marrow,\nPeerless beauty slays the hero.\nBoast all you like of turning heaven’s will,\nVaunt your world-conquering deeds.\n\nYet time, once gone, cannot return,\nEvents, once past, are never repeated.\nBlooming and fading stand opposed,\nRise and fall share the same principle.\nThose who grasp heaven’s workings but shallowly\nCannot escape this restless longing.\n\n---\n\n**Long Chant of Fragrant Grass**\n\nLet fragrant grasses cease to grow,\nLet fragrant cups no longer pour.\nIf grasses grow without end,\nHow could the cup ever pause?\n\nAfter rain, in idle pavilions,\nDeep in spring, in small courtyard courts.\nAt this hour, curtains hang half-raised,\nIn this moment, wine just sobers the mind.\n\nTender shoots spread thickly,\nSoft green already takes shape.\nThey soften the last pale rays,\nSummon the light chill of dawn.\n\nQuietly gracing the flowered village,\nIdly adorning the bamboo grove.\nBy the stream, gentle waters lap,\nOn the plain, spring plowing has not begun.\n\nLet not perfumed carriages trample them,\nForbid fine steeds to tread here.\nLying upon them, endless thoughts arise,\nGazing long, emotions overwhelm.\n\nFrom distant terraces, brows first knit,\nFrom lofty towers, eyes suddenly brighten.\nLow, the evening clouds stretch blue,\nFaint, the distant mountains fade to green.\n\nEmerald meets the mandarin ducks’ shore,\nLush connects the willows’ isle.\nBy riverside piers, night sails drop,\nOn sea islets, evening boats lie crosswise.\n\nA single tune from the garrison’s horn,\nA few notes from the herdboy’s flute.\nOn sandy banks, a pair of egrets descends,\nAt the ferry, startled geese scatter.\n\nLush and dense, they cover the march’s route,\nTender and thick, they line the envoy’s path.\nFar and wide, they spread along the roads,\nEncircling every short and long pavilion.\n\nFading, the tomb of Qin’s First Emperor,\nScattered, the city of Han’s emperors.\nDesolate, the old Bronze Sparrow Tower,\nRuined, the former Golden Capital.\n\nMist veils the deeds of past dynasties,\nHaze dims the names of later ages.\nWithered, they still hide cunning hares,\nRotten, they yet breed fireflies.\n\nThough mown, how can they ever be gone?\nScorched, they sprout anew.\nVainly they cloak the burial mounds,\nYet still they long for peace.\n\n---\n\n**Long Chant of Spring Waters**\n\nSpring lingers where waters run clear,\nSpring departs, and swimming ceases.\nClearness does not fall short of purity,\nYet spring surpasses autumn’s grace.\n\nPurity found in sunlight’s warmth,\nClarity sought in the cold’s embrace.\nA degree beyond mere clarity—\nThus purity is deemed supreme.\n\nThin ice begins to float,\nLight rain just ceases.\nVast and boundless, new isles appear,\nGlistening, old shores gleam.\n\nLotus and water-chestnut leaves still droop,\nCattails and reeds now sprout.\nWater-shield and pondweed emerge,\nDuckweed and water-milfoil not yet dense.\n\nIn warm sun, mandarin ducks bathe,\nIn misty clarity, kingfishers glide.\nWaves calm, twin carp leap,\nWind still, gulls play in flocks.\n\nIn western Shu, outings vie in splendor,\nIn eastern Ou, purification rites are grand.\nThe Peach Blossom Spring is recognized anew,\nThe Han River’s girdle-pendants return.\n\nBeneath terraces, waters flow smoothly,\nBeside embankments, they wander endlessly.\nBefore railings, they barely ripple,\nBeyond the sky, they stretch ever onward.\n\nOverflowing, the heart grows troubled,\nMurmuring, the mind turns deep.\nDistant mountains cannot block their course,\nParting shores refuse to hold them back.\n\nBy the bridge in the second month,\nAt the wild ferry in the Three Wu lands.\nAs before, two oars lie crosswise,\nYet now they send a lone boat forth.\n\nThe painter lays down his brush,\nThe poet leans upon the tower.\nBeyond the Yangtze’s flying catkins,\nOnly parting sorrows stir.\n\n---\n\n**Long Chant of Flowers and Moon**\n\nIn youth, I craved but two lines of verse,\nAll worldly joys seemed folly then.\nNow I long to undo past regrets,\nYet how can my spirit match its former fire?\n\nEach time flowers bloom and the moon waxes full,\nWhat is this feeling that returns?\nIn such moments, without poetry or wine,\nI would rather die than awaken.\n\nWhen flowers meet the bright moon, their spirits soar,\nWhen the moon sees rare blossoms, their radiance unfolds.\nMan, flower, and moon become one,\nAnd I feel this body roam the jeweled realm.\n\nYet I fear the moon may be veiled by clouds,\nI dread the flowers may be torn by the wind.\n\nIf poetry and wine are not taken up again,\nThis moment will slip by, becoming but a fleeting guilt.\nFortunately, there remains a long poem to gather,\nFortunately, there remains a clear wine flask to hold.\nWhen poem and wine flask are shared from time to time,\nIt is as if flowers and moon call to one another.\nWith flowers but no moon, the flowers age in sorrow,\nWith moon but no flowers, the moon resents its solitude.\nThe moon’s resentment can only be told through poetry,\nThe flowers’ sorrow relies entirely on wine to sustain.\nWhen not a trace of moon’s resentment or flowers’ sorrow remains,\nOnly then does one know the skill of poetry and wine.\nIn such carefree leisure beneath the trees,\nWho could fault this refined indulgence?\n\n**Visiting the Shangqing Palace with Prefect Li and Academician Ge**\nIn Luoyang’s second month, spring sways and drifts,\nPeach and plum bloom thick as marching screens.\nHigh blossoms and low blossoms link in crimson,\nWhile willows rise even above the highest flowers.\nLeisurely accompanying the Prefect beyond the city gates,\nWe sought the true palace on Mang Hill.\nNo longer seeing the imperial procession’s western journey,\nI stood in the wind all day, lost in melancholy.\n\n**Begging for Bamboo Flute-Plants from the Estate of Minister Li Shaobao**\nWildly planted, idle flowers claim the earth,\nNever deigning to linger with ease.\nYet how can one not love their frost-defying integrity—\nOr the name still carved upon the flute?\nWhen the phoenix arrives, they will bear fruit,\nWhere the dragon’s song is learned, can there be no sound?\nThis recluse begs for a few stalks to plant,\nTo gain honor from your noble house once more.\n\n**Chant of Longing for the Mountains**\nBehold the green mountains and white clouds,\nYet ponder the boundless merit they hold.\nWho knows the joy they bring, and for what reason—\nIs it merely to sate hunger with herbs?\nA thousand clumsy poems fail to express my grievance,\nA single cup of fine wine harbors spring anew.\nHow vast the days and months within the flask—\nHow many generations in the red dust grow old?\n\nI fear the body may be idle while the heart is not,\nYet if the heart is idle, why dwell in clouded mountains?\nIf truly at ease in nature’s embrace,\nWho would bury themselves in profit and strife?\nMy actions require no caution, no taboo,\nMy words need no artifice, no schemes.\nWho could have imagined joy would reach such heights—\nA heavenly steed leaves no trace, coming and going as it pleases.\n\n**Chant of Resenting the Moon**\nIt is not that I begrudge gold,\nBut that Chang’e loves inconstancy.\nJust before her ascent, she drips with dew,\nNo sooner full than the sky darkens.\nI lean on the railing again and again,\nPouring fragrant wine, then pouring once more.\nIf only I could confine her in the women’s quarters,\nYet how deeply she has misled me, before and after.\n\n**Chant of Sorrowing for Flowers**\nThree thousand palace ladies in their robes,\nEach hoping for favor, each lovely in her own way.\nAt first bloom, they seem delicate,\nHalf-opened, they become alluring and rich.\nBefore the heartwood reveals itself, fragrance already spreads,\nAs dew-laden powder falls, the soul melts away.\nFacing such a fragrant cup, how many thoughts arise—\nYet soon wind and rain will ride roughshod over them.\n\n**Matching Zhang Ziwang’s “Viewing Flowers in Luoyang”**\nCreation has never failed mankind,\nMyriad reds and purples reveal heaven’s truth.\nThe city teems with carriages and horses in vain chaos,\nFor not all who meet spring truly grasp it.\n\n**Short Chant on Falling Flowers**\nThe garden’s peach and plum scatter in disarray,\nFurther torn by a wanton wind.\nEver sorrowful when they first fade,\nYet one must recall their unopened beauty.\nAlas, how swiftly crimson splendor fades,\nUnlike the slow change of green shade.\nNinety days of spring have all but gone—\nHow can I bear to furrow my brow before the cup?\n\n**Short Chant on Fragrant Grass**\nBy flowered banks and waters, green as a mat,\nRising and falling through Han and Qin.\nClaiming endless land across mountains and rivers,\nHow many through the ages have grieved for them?\nThough severe frost kills, rain revives them,\nThough wildfire burns, spring returns.\nYet why does this plant thrive so abundantly by the road?\nFarmers forever weary of its encroachment.\n\n**Short Chant on Weeping Willows**\nBy the stream, brushing the water, they sway,\nFurther tossed by the relentless wind.\nAt dusk, they cannot bear the thickening mist,\nIn deep spring, they chafe at the lingering sun.\nWhose ethereal green silk scarf flutters?\nWhere do the golden-threaded robes dance?\nStill fearing the parting lover’s heart is not yet broken,\nThe sky fills once more with scattered blossoms.\n\n**Short Chant on Spring Waters**\nSnow melts, ice thaws, filling the channels,\nKingfishers and mandarin ducks revel in autumn’s pride.\nEver resenting distant mountains that block the view,\nYet doubting if the branching stream can detain them.\nWillows along the bank brush lightly,\nNew reeds by the shore sprout tenderly.\nEndless misty waves fill the eyes—\nThe Three Wu regions send forth a lone boat.\n\n**Short Chant on the Pure Breeze**\nThe pure breeze’s vigor has not yet fully waned,\nWho says heaven’s heart has cast it aside?\nEver steadfast in fasting and solemnity while studying the *Yi*,\nEver ashamed of my carefree ways when composing verse.\nThe world’s fine scenes all pass before my eyes,\nThe age’s idle sorrows never touch my brow.\nBorn in an era of peace, untroubled by strife,\nI grow old in these peaceful times.\n\n**Late Spring Letter to Li Shenyan, Dragon Diagram Scholar**\nYear after year, I dread the deepening spring,\nFor each time it deepens, my illness cannot bear it.\nA small gathering leaves me wounded by wine,\nThe weather for tending flowers favors light shade.\nThe years change as they always have,\nYet the seasons cannot turn back an aging heart.\nOnly the front pavilion is fit for quiet sitting,\nWhere I face the wind and long for old friends.\n\n**Early Summer Leisure Chant**\nIn the depths of green willows, orioles trill,\nTheir songs still able to delight in peace.\nIs it not fortune for one to enjoy long years?\nDoes heaven not feel for the rare treasures it creates?\nWhen peonies fade, purple cherries ripen,\nWhen peonies bloom, the *ban* orchids flourish.\nIn the grove, a kind of idle wealth and honor—\nWhy should I yield to dukes and ministers?\n\n**Letter in Reply to Judge Yao Fuzhou and Section Chief Zhou of the Kaifeng Prefecture**\nThe ways of the world often thwart our wishes,\nTo speak of advancement is to know nothing.\nBetter to ponder idle matters at leisure,\nThan to debate endlessly on West Street.\nEven with extraordinary talent to move the world,\nAlas, my temples are already silvered.\nThe new moon on the horizon has always been slender,\nNot for the sake of painting brows in the human realm.\n\nYour letter says: *\"I hope you take care of yourself, for I fear the woods will not long hold you.\"*\n**The Yi River’s “Striking the Earth” Collection, Volume Six Concludes**\n**The Yi River’s “Striking the Earth” Collection, Volume Seven**\n\n**Written on Behalf of Shao Yong of Yichuan to Zhang Duhuan, Prefect of Haozhou**\n\nMuch ashamed, I too have found no kindred spirit—\nThough the music of heaven is heard, it permits no pursuit.\nMaster Hui’s political acumen was naturally keen,\nWhile Zhuangzi’s wanderings held profound intent.\nIn leisure, I briefly record the events of a spring;\nIn old age, my thousand-mile aspirations falter.\nAmong the friends of the Luo Society, when we meet,\nRecite for me the *White-Haired Lament*.\n\n**Three Responses to a Villager Declining Office**\n\nThrough life, I’ve done nothing to furrow brows—\nThe world should have no one who gnashes their teeth at me.\nWhy waste rain to hasten the fall of blossoms?\nHow could spring be needed to adorn old things?\nFortunate to live under Yao and Shun as true sovereigns,\nI let the recluses Chao and You remain outer ministers.\nA sick man of sixty should know his place—\nNo need for supervisory officials to press their appeals.\n\n**Matching the Rhyme of Vice Director Wang Anzhi**\n\nI fear my fellow villagers may not yet understand,\nBut once they know me deeply, what doubt remains?\nIn poverty, accepting salary is permissible;\nIn old age, taking office is hard to justify.\nI have my forests and streams to settle my plain aspirations;\nIn death, my lack of talent will not trouble the imperial court.\nIf Xun and Yang had upheld our Confucian bounds,\nThey’d have spared themselves Han Yu’s critique of minor flaws.\n\n**Matching the Rhyme of Liu Zhifang’s Gift**\n\nThe Creator’s craftsmanship holds profound intent—\nWhere I find joy is in the mountains and forests.\nIn youth, frequent illness kept me from seeking office;\nIn old age, lack of talent makes my heart unmoved.\nBy quiet waters, I walk amid flowers and moonlight;\nIn fragrant orchid breezes, I rest beneath pine shade.\nAt leisure by the window, I sleep at ease—\nWishing for enfeoffment or gold bestowed.\n\n**Written on Behalf of Wang Shengzhi, Academician, Thanking Him for the Gift of Lai Stone Tea and Wine Vessels**\n\nOn Eastern Mountain lies a stone like jade,\nWhich artisans carve to hold wine.\nYou, sir, obtained it but cherished it unused,\nAnd with great care sent it to this forest-dwelling elder.\nThis elder has always used clay cups—\nStartled, he dares not lift it with his hands.\nHe sternly warns his children not to damage it,\nSealing it away to await a worthy friend.\nYet I know not when that worthy friend will return—\nA man’s achievements remain unfulfilled.\nThe court first heeds the words of the concerned:\nToday, none compare to the two barbarian foes.\nThe Han’s six commanderies were bounded by Liaoxi,\nThe Tang’s eight prefectures cut off beyond the mountains.\nBeyond lie Gansha, Gan, and Liang—\nThe Central Plains have long been unable to reclaim them.\nWhy further bait them with gold and silk,\nBurdening our people and hindering our arms?\nWere it not for a bold strike from the court,\nHow could the frontier crush these decaying foes?\nDrive them out past their stinking lands—\nWest through Yumen, north beyond the passes.\nWith the foxes beneath the city walls gone,\nThe wolves on the roads will scatter of themselves.\nThe sun blazes bright on the celestial thoroughfare,\nWhile ominous vapors and shifting omens hide in dust.\nUpon success, he refuses the highest rewards,\nReturning his seal and gold greater than a peck.\nBegging leave of the sovereign, he departs the capital—\nHis homeward saddle brushes the willows of Heavenly Street.\nA thousand officials, like jade walls, block the road to detain him,\nBut he lifts his face, cracks his whip, and does not look back.\nVillagers line the road to welcome the great prefect;\nDrunk, he is borne by banners and gleaming brocade.\nAlighting, he visits his ancestors’ graves and resumes governance,\nYet does not call at the yamen—only at the homes of kin and old friends.\nOnly then do I know this vessel has its time of use—\nI shall offer it to you for long life.\n\n**At Chongde Pavilion, Responding to Various Gentlemen on Silent Chan**\n\nThe vast sky races with the sun’s wheel—\nWhy trouble yourself to distinguish root from dust?\nThe roc’s ten-thousand-mile journey needs no carriage;\nThe crane’s three-thousand-year lifespan has its own spring.\nAlchemy turns lead and tin to gold—yet it is false;\nPainting a horse in ink seeks truth in vain.\nLook upon this wind-whipped, freezing night—\nWho stands firm at the gate?\n\n**Leaning on the Railing of the Small Pavilion in the Celestial Palace**\n\nThis frail, six-foot frame, sick and weakened,\nFits the daily deepening of decline.\nAll the clarity I regret is in my heart—\nNot a word can be entrusted before it’s too late.\nGold lies hidden in sand, yet one must sift to find it;\nJade is embedded in stone—how can one doubt?\nThis sorrow lingers in the autumn dusk’s west wind,\nAs I lean on every railing, unknown to others.\n\n**Written on Behalf of Wu the Daoist of Yuntai Abbey, Huashan**\n\nThe central peak of Mount Hua soars five thousand *ren*,\nBeneath it, the great Dao sees travelers come and go.\nOne glance back from horseback in those days—\nA decade later, my dreaming soul still crosses the pass.\nAll my life, I’ve loved mountains, yet they never sate me;\nFrom here, I’ve seen all the mountains under heaven.\nTo find another like Mount Hua is rare—\nIt lets a man while away his whole life in leisure.\n\n**Written on Behalf of Zhang Wentong, Attaché in Chang’an**\n\nNo learning, no schemes—\nMy breast has long been empty.\nMy withered guts delight in wine;\nMy ailing eyes fear books.\nBy the Luo’s banks, wrapped in wind;\nAt Tianjin Bridge, after a light rain.\nAn old friend lies a thousand miles away—\nGazing toward him, what are my thoughts?\n\n**Matching a Poem on Hearing Han Weigong’s Departure to Govern Yongxing, Passing Through Luoyang**\n\nAiding three reigns as Grand Minister,\nHis name endures through ages as a foundational merit.\nHe nurtured peaches and plums across the world;\nHe rode the winds and waves through half the seas.\nIn the tiger’s tent, the night’s chill steels his heart;\nIn the Phoenix Pool, warm waves leave his post still vacant.\nThe sovereign’s reign is in its prime, with Guo Ziyi at hand—\nThe lands of He and Huang are not worth attacking.\n\n**Written on Behalf of Zhang Jingzhen, Salt Transport Commissioner of Baibo**\n\nAutumn enters the mountains and rivers with majestic air—\nI cannot bear this idle gazing in old age.\nOur golden friendship weighs heavily on my endless thoughts;\nThe bonds of brotherhood stir endless feelings.\nA half-finished game of chess passes the white day;\nA single hairpin of gray hair tangles in the west wind.\nOnly you and your father have known me long—\nOur pine and cassia hearts share the same hue.\n\n**Written on Behalf of Zhang Taibo, Magistrate of Yinjiang**\n\nI still recall that year sweeping our humble hut,\nBrothers together at the start of our official careers.\nA lifetime forgets the commonplace—\nYet a thousand miles still exchange letters as if face-to-face.\nI know from afar that the winds and moon of Siming are fine;\nThe rivers and mountains are even more so in late autumn.\nA single sail has not yet found time to fly free—\nIn vain, I see your father inquiring after me.\n\n**First Signs**\n\nTo recognize the first signs is to be one of us—\nBeware of lightly joining the world’s vulgar laughter.\nBetter to display clumsiness before the crowd\nThan to jest in solitude.\nA thousand strange flowers, in every form, yield to the eye;\nOne bright moon, a single wheel, always enters the heart.\nWith such moments, how could time be spent in vain?\nI know the joy of being human.\n\n**Western Pavilion in Late Autumn**\n\nAround the railings, chrysanthemums bloom in unison;\nDoors, windows, and pavilions are all fragrant.\n\n**In High Spirits**\n\nIn high spirits, one cannot but sing and chant;\nIn times of joy, one again encounters abundance.\nDeep autumn’s scenery is fittingly fine,\nAnd in old age, sinews and bones remain roughly sound.\nAfter drinking, why not ascend for a view?\nAmid piled rosy clouds lingers the setting sun.\n\n**Leisurely Stroll by the Heavenly Ford**\n\nWithin Luoyang’s walls, I roam freely east and west,\nTwenty years of indolence now fully spent.\nOld friends abound, their kindness warm and deep,\nWhile the capital’s grandeur exudes ease and grace.\nThe pond, level, resembles rivers and lakes;\nThe woods, still, evoke mountain valleys.\nNo need for deeds to shake the world—\nThe joy of quiet dwelling is boundless.\n\n**In Reply to Two Gentlemen of Chang’an, Zhang and Qiang**\n\nYour poems surpass treasures of linked cities,\nYet my talent falls short of Mi Heng’s.\nI thought my plight like the steadfast boat would never meet favor,\nBut now, to my surprise, I am honored with splendid robes.\nAfter rain on Min and E peaks, their sharpness is revealed;\nAfter frost on winds and moon, their clarity appears.\nAncients spoke of few who could respond—\nWas the \"White Snow in Spring\" an empty name?\n\n**Letter in Reply to Prefect Zhang of Huainan**\n\nSeeking fish by climbing trees is surely futile,\nBut seeking roasted fish by following fish may work.\nBetter to refuse the great goblet while drunk\nThan to seek fine medicine after falling ill.\nDo not plant rootless lingzhi—why bother?\nPeaches of immortality bear fruit without difficulty.\nYour kindness runs deep;\nA mustard seed’s honor is still honor.\n\n**Occasional Verse**\n\nThe consummate master refuses imitation,\nYet to act otherwise is to abandon the golden chariot.\nTo claim nothing is difficult under heaven\nIs to deny true men exist in the world.\nHeaven’s will aligns with the times for good measure;\nHuman nature finds peace in contentment.\nBetween heaven and man lies but a hair’s breadth—\nBeyond it, all is as distant as the Five Lakes.\n\n**Letter to a Friend**\n\nTwo decades have passed since we parted,\nYears like arrows—only sighs remain.\nThough long separated by hardship, east and west,\nWe exchanged earnest letters before and after.\nHomeland’s mountains and rivers live now in dreams;\nOld friends and kin lie half in ruins.\nWhen shall we recount those days again,\nLaughing into the west wind as we crack open wine jars?\n\n**Wind Blows the Leaves (Third Year of Xining)**\n\nThe wind blows the leaves, not the roots—\nBeware of bitterly pleading your roots’ case.\nThe Son of Heaven’s old capital is pleasant to dwell in;\nThe Sage’s lesser affairs are too trivial to discuss.\nIn the land’s long years, immortals are companions;\nIn the nest of peace, wealth and honor abide.\nHaving traversed ten thousand waters and a thousand mountains,\nReturning, I recognize my true self.\n\n**Leisurely Stroll**\n\nI often recall sweeping my humble hut in those days,\nNever letting the three paths grow wild.\nI wished to be the world’s dragon-slayer,\nBut would I read unholy books?\nUnderstanding fortune and misfortune, I knew when to advance or retreat;\nSeeing heaven and earth, I discerned near and far.\nOnce I grasped the Way’s circular nature,\nNot a trace of idle vexation remained in my breast.\n\n**Seeking the Azure Sky in Wu and Yue**\n\nYou rush to Wu and Yue to find the azure sky,\nUnknowing it lies before your eyes.\nTo see it with open eyes is still flawed;\nTo seek it with raised head is without cause.\nYan Yuan was in his \"like a fool\" days,\nMencius in his \"unmoved\" years.\nHow to find time to wander the jewel markets,\nLoving others’ pearls and jades while fretting over coins?\n\n**Buying Divination to Resolve Doubts**\n\nBuying divination is buying doubt—\nWith deep illness, what medicine can cure?\nDreams within dreams, layer upon layer of delusion;\nForests on beds, error upon error.\nLiezi riding the wind still depended on something;\nThe boaster chasing the sun surely grew weary.\nMuch toil, yet no achievement—\nI’ve trodden all the world’s idle paths.\n\n**Drinking Before Flowers**\n\nThey say beyond things lie misty clouds,\nBut are misty clouds beyond things worth boasting?\nIf you make comparisons your joy,\nThen freedom from care is the immortal’s home.\nA century’s fleeting light cannot be detained;\nTen days of fragrance depart unchecked.\nTo drink with flowers is no betrayal of wine;\nTo face flowers without wine is to wrong the flowers.\n\n**Strolling in the Rear Garden After Spring’s End**\n\nGreen trees form a canopy in the sun;\nYellow orioles converse in pairs.\nThe small channel shimmers freshly;\nNew bamboo stands in uneven rows.\nLeaning on my staff, I chant idly for long;\nWith a child in tow, my steps slow.\nThe fine breeze knows my intent,\nBlowing toward me again and again.\n\n**Letter to Wu Chuanzheng, Vice Magistrate**\n\nYour steadfast heart is rare in this world;\nThe events of that day, this year, are hard to trace.\nSnow and frost, though never mild, are not unbearable;\nPines and cassia never change their hues.\nScholars of Luoyi still trust me;\nOnly you know the winds and moon of Tianjin.\nMy dreaming soul, unaware of Luoyang’s distance,\nStill visits you as in days of old.\n\n**Gardens and Pools of Luoxia**\n\nThe gardens and pools of Luoxia need no gates;\nNo need to seek spring in other grotto-heavens.\nEven unrestrained wanderers cannot match the idle guest;\nWho asks the owner when entering everywhere?\nThe smaller pavilions’ railings frame flowers’ beauty;\nThe overgrown terraces reveal scenes’ truth.\nEmpty fame has misled endless affairs—\nNot all empty fame reaches one’s person.\n\n**Dream of Visiting the Eastern City to Call on Yang Yingzhi, Magistrate of Luoyang**\n\nLast night, a clear dream took me east of the city,\nWhere streams divided, paths ran straight.\nIt was like riding a raft on the Milky Way,\nBut without Yan Zi to verify my tracks.\n\n**Letter to Former Luoyang Recorder Lu Gangshu, Secretariat Drafter**\n\nWhen your term in Luoyang ended, you shook your robes,\nHow could dust defile your distant journey?\nFortunately, the Way meets with clear days and months;\nWith bright eyes, you should see old rivers and lakes.\nOnly the worthy know when to act and when to stop;\nTrue men can bend and stretch.\nWhy not return with the receding waters?\nThe three Wu regions remain as they were before.\n\n**Reply to One Requesting Green Reed**\n\nAmong praiseworthy grasses,\nDo not rank it with mugwort and wormwood.\nLush and spreading, it resembles bamboo;\nIts verdant hue suits autumn best.\nAt first rustling in wind and rain,\nIt stirs thoughts of rivers and lakes.\nThough it serves no use in the world,\nIt offers this brief respite.\n\n**Carefree Chant**\n\nThe Way is fundamentally level,\nYet few are willing to walk it.\nGaining the heart brings no rich flavor;\nLosing footing means deep pits.\nWithout penetrating heaven and earth,\nHow can one understand life and death?\nIn this matter,\nOne must be sincere and clear.\n\n**Human Life**\n\nPeople lament insufficiency,\nBut what more is there to seek beyond sufficiency?\nThough my life is not yet sufficient,\nIt is also free of care.\nHarmony with heaven is nurtured with wine;\nTrue joy is drawn forth with poetry.\nDo not doubt that time will hurry you—\nIt hastens men to early gray.\n\n**Preserving Harmony**\n\n**Entering Peaceful Abode at Night**\n\nAt night I enter my Peaceful Abode,\nAt dawn I rise to drink Great Harmony.\nProbing the spirit, I know the Dao is at ease;\nCultivating simplicity, I gain much from heaven.\nSun and moon submit to their ceaseless sway,\nMountains and rivers endure their endless carving.\nThose who seek to be such as this—\nWhen all is said and done, who are they?\n\n**What Moves Men Deeply**\n\nWhat stirs the heart so deeply?\nOne searches yet finds no trace.\nThe Two Modes ever rest in hand,\nThe myriad transformations no longer weigh on the mind.\nJade lies hidden within stone,\nGold is often found in sand.\nThough clear, it defies all reason—\nOne must sink into profound reflection.\n\n**An Impromptu Chant**\n\nA hair’s breadth apart,\nYet a thousand mountains, ten thousand peaks lie between.\nThough one may forget sleep and food,\nOne will not abandon the workings of the world.\nNot that I demand perfection of others,\nBut how hard it is to speak of this!\nThe heart of heaven is not far—\nYet once far, there is no return.\n\n**Each Time I Visit My Eastern Neighbor**\n\nEach time I visit my eastern neighbor,\nMy eastern neighbor grows ever more earnest.\nSince I come, I am always filled with shame;\nWhen we meet, we are as close as kin.\nFood and drink follow our preferences,\nEven the children obey of their own accord.\nIn my homeland there is such joy—\nWhy seek further benevolence?\n\n**Each Time I Pass the Eastern Street**\n\nEach time I pass the eastern street,\nThe eastern street resents my late arrival.\nAll we do is idle chatter,\nUnmindful of how freely we open our hearts.\nI possess a thousand joys,\nOthers harbor not a single doubt.\nHalf-drunk on joyful wine,\nIt is not yet late, yet I do not return.\n\n**The Noble Man in Fellowship**\n\nThe noble man in fellowship\nIs never without caution.\nThe petty man in fellowship\nIs never without fault.\nOnly this true joy\nShould be cherished and treasured.\nIn later years, when clouds and waters grow distant,\nIt may be hard to find again.\n\n**Heaven’s Two Qi**\n\nHeaven possesses two qi:\nOne yin, one yang.\nFrom yin’s error come serpents and scorpions;\nFrom yang’s harmony arise phoenixes.\nIf only serpents and scorpions would die,\nThey would no longer bring calamity to men.\nIf only phoenixes would be born,\nThey would forever bring good fortune to the state.\n\n**No Guest Can Alter Heaven’s Will**\n\nNo guest can alter heaven’s will,\nYet some provide provisions for thieves.\nAt midday, brawls are often seen;\nIn the sixth month, frost descends.\nBooks lie unread,\nFood goes untasted.\nMeals barely fill a jar,\nBooks pile empty upon the bed.\n\n**Love of Life, Fear of Death**\n\nTo hate death and love life—\nSuch is the constant nature of past and present.\nIf men’s hearts could give rise to affairs,\nThe world would know no war.\nEven grasses and trees flourish in harmony;\nHow could mountains and rivers not be at peace?\nWhy then is there no joy in plow and cup,\nNo celebration of peace?\n\n**Releasing the Small Fish**\n\nTiny and frail, not worth keeping—\nTo lose this is to lose a life.\nI release you to rivers and lakes,\nWhere you may swim freely, far from pot and cauldron.\nBeware the nets that lie deep,\nTake care not to mistake the hook.\nThe world is full of those who cook—\nDo not let yourself become their dish.\n\n**Matching Rhymes for Minister Tian’s Gift**\n\nEach day I stroll my garden,\nWhere the pure wind costs nothing.\nAmid the city, I find rustic scenes,\nBeneath the bamboo, I play with flowing springs.\nThough I see no cause for sighing,\nWhy not nurture my boundless spirit?\nYet I am ashamed before the scholars of the world—\nTheir words on the Dao have not forgotten the fish-trap.\n\n**Begging for Bamboo to Make a Flute**\n\nThe people of Luoyang love to plant flowers,\nWhile I alone love to plant bamboo.\nThough our loves differ,\nOur hearts are equally content.\nFlowers bloom red for but ten days,\nBamboo stays green through the years.\nBoth receive the grace of rain and dew,\nYet only bamboo escapes the shame of frost and snow.\n\n**Matching Rhymes for Secretary Wang Buyi’s Invitation to Drink**\n\nThrough hardship, I recall Master Fuqiu,\nYet my homeland offers ample delight.\nBefore the wind, I am startled by white hair;\nAfter the rain, I welcome the new autumn.\nThough my official ambitions are faint,\nMy joy in climbing heights never fades.\nThe world’s vain worries\nNever reach my heart.\n\n**Again Matching Rhymes for Secretary Wang Buyi’s Gift**\n\nThe weather turns cool and fine—\nWhere is there a place not fit for wandering?\nOn the day the wild geese arrive as guests,\nThe hawk’s ambition stirs in autumn.\nForgetting form, we revel all night;\nOne misstep, and a life is lost.\nHow many on rivers and lakes\nHave yet to reach their journey’s end?\n\n**Matching Rhymes with the Three Secretaries Wang Visiting My Humble Abode**\n\nTo be content is to find beauty in certainty.\nIn Luoyang, poetry has its society,\nAnd verses flow like divine speech from horseback.\nWhite-haired, our friendship runs deep;\nYellow chrysanthemums mark the season’s renewal.\nTo be visited warms the heart;\nTo feel shame is to know the Dao is not pure.\nAmid the desolate western wind,\nWith leisure, I am half an ancient man.\n\n**A Letter in Place of Writing to Censor Lü Xianke of Nanyang, Guardian of the Imperial Counsel**\n\nTwo cycles of stars and frost have passed since we parted,\nOur rise and fall unmarked by word or sound.\nIn the groves, laughter and talk must return to me;\nThe world’s peace and peril should rest with you.\nBefore the Son of Heaven, you often speak boldly;\nOn Hundred-Flower Isle, you move with ease.\nI wonder, on nights of white moon and clear wind,\nIf you recall the old fisherman of Yi River.\n\n**To Attendant Wu Chuanzheng**\n\nHow lonely the wind and moon of Tianjin Bridge!\nLike me, do you remember them after autumn’s passing?\nEach time I rely on the clear waves to send my voice,\nI wonder if it ever reaches the Eastern Capital.\n\n**To Former Registrar of Luoyang, Lu Gangshu, and Collator**\n\nHaving completed your term in Luoyang, you return to Wu and Kuaiji,\nA man of grand ambition, your aspirations yet unfulfilled.\nWhen you reach the finest landscapes,\nRaise your cup without hesitation and gaze toward Tianjin.\n\n**Matching Rhymes for Censor Zhang of Huainan**\n\nThe courtyard wutong leaves half-yellow,\nThe chrysanthemums by the fence just receive the frost.\nAs evening approaches, my mood turns heavy;\nI take up my wine and gaze southwest.\nI gaze for you but do not see you—\nOnly the wild geese flying south.\nJust as I think to send a letter,\nA few lines form of their own accord.\n\n**Written the Day Before the Double Ninth**\n\nLately, illness has left me speechless,\nLonging only to drowse in drunken sleep.\nNew wine arrives just in time for the Double Ninth,\nFine blossoms greet the season of Little Spring.\nI know my fate is meager, looming overhead,\nAnd wish no more affairs would come before my eyes.\nOnly the setting sun over Tianjin Bridge remains,\nThe sound of water still murmuring as of old.\n\n**On the Double Ninth, Ascending the Stone Pavilion (Three Poems)**\n\n**I**\nHuman feelings, once seen, are many;\nWorldly ways, long known, are familiar.\nAfter the fact, one gnaws with regret;\nAt the loss of things, one guards against hindrance.\nMuddy water must be settled and strained,\nDusty clothes must be shaken and brushed.\nIf one must discuss the helmsman,\nWho is truly skilled?\n\n**II**\nEvents arise in a moment,\nOnce past, they cannot return.\nAt the time, they seem deeply lovable;\nAfterward, they are unbearable to behold.\nSummer departs—no need to speak of heat;\nWinter comes—then one discusses the cold.\nIf men could grasp this principle,\nWorries and troubles would find no purchase.\n\n**III**\nOn this year’s Double Ninth,\nLeaning on the railing, the air feels slow.\nThough clouds and mist have grown faint,\nThe woods have not yet wholly withered.\n\n**Where Heaven and Earth Open Their Embrace**\n\nWhere heaven and earth open their embrace,\nMountains and rivers delight the eye.\nI lean on every railing in vain—\nWho understands this feeling?\n\n---\n\n**Matching Rhyme in Reply to a Friend**\n\nA million armored troops stir the frontier dust,\nThe court’s commission is no light trust.\nThough the barbarian’s schemes run shallow,\nA true statesman’s loyalty must be pure.\nOn the frontier, songs of sorrow rise in anger;\nIn the groves, drunken toasts turn to bitterness.\nI long to offer a single word of good counsel,\nYet fear my friend may not know me truly.\n\n---\n\n**An Occasional Verse**\n\nWealth and rank breed arrogance in men,\nAnd human feelings shift with time.\nVirtue does not scorn others—\nOver time, hearts turn ever more toward it.\n\nVirtue follows constant principles;\nWealth and rank know no fixed term.\nWhen frost comes, the weeds wither,\nBut the pines and cypresses grow lush in snow.\n\nMost men flock to the powerful,\nYet when their fire fades, they depart.\nThe noble man fares well in hardship—\nThrough long restraint, his bonds grow firm.\n\nWhen the blaze dies, its power does not return;\nWhen affection is steadfast, men do not leave.\nStrangers may seem like kin,\nWhile kin may seem like strangers.\n\nWhat matters is the closeness of heart and deed—\nIn closeness, good and evil part ways.\nIs there truly nothing of worth in the world?\nSurely there are men beneath heaven.\n\nHaving seen the stench of the foul,\nOne must think of jade and stone burned together.\nHow can the temper of the times endure,\nEver like spring in Luoyang?\n\n---\n\n**Untitled Verse**\n\nOnce I did not refine things,\nAnd was misled by them.\nNow I do not refine men,\nYet am met with their anger.\n\nThe misguidance of things can be explained,\nBut human wrath is hard to appeal.\nI admit my faults to others,\nAnd they, too, forgive me.\n\n---\n\n**No Wine to Drink**\n\nSince the new laws took effect,\nI’ve often suffered from an empty jar.\nWhenever guests and friends arrive,\nWe idle the whole day together.\n\nIf I must beg from others,\nEven close kin have none to spare.\nIf I must pawn my clothes to buy wine,\nHow can this last long?\n\n---\n\n**Reading Tao Yuanming’s “Returning Home”**\n\nReturn home! Let me follow my true nature,\nThough affairs are past, my intent feels new.\nWhen did I not live in such an age?\nYet how rare to meet a man like this.\n\nAs dusk nears, I sigh at the gathering gloom;\nFacing the flourishing, I rejoice in the trees’ joy.\nPity that six hundred years later,\nAnother idle man follows in his dust.\n\n---\n\n*Yichuan Jirang Collection, Volume Seven Concludes*\n*Yichuan Jirang Collection, Volume Eight*\n\n**Visiting the Zhang Brothers of Nanyuan and Staying Overnight**\n\nMid-Autumn’s weather, fair as one could wish,\nI came to Nanyuan to meet the reclusive Zhangs.\nToo fond of drink to leave while dusk grew late,\nI slept amid the mist and clouds of Water-Crystal Hall.\n\n---\n\n**Touring Longmen with Wang Anzhi, Vice Minister**\n\nBy nature fond of seeking secluded spots,\nI visit Dragon Mountain four or five times a year.\nWhether coming or going, I keep no count—\nNo worldly gain could make me linger there.\n\nFor days we lingered, watching the Yi’s flow,\nThen divined a night on Incense Mountain’s stone tower.\nA cool breeze stirred thoughts of distant things,\nAnd misty rain played with the high autumn air.\n\n---\n\n**Returning to the City, Again in the Same Rhyme**\n\nIn high spirits, I explored Dragon Mountain’s depths,\nAs if wandering through a painted scene.\nRegretting no fine wine to match the view,\nJust when I wished to stay, I could not remain.\n\n---\n\n**Another Poem**\n\nEarly autumn’s light rain brings a gentle chill,\nI lean on the eastern pavilion’s railing.\nWho would have thought, amid such misty haze,\nThe pine study would seem a painted scroll?\n\n*(The Pine Study, home of Anzhi’s younger brother, lies west of the water.)*\n\n---\n\n**Inscribed for Minister Zhang’s Hermitage**\n\nHaving served as the Three Dukes and lived long,\nHe ranks first in human blessings and virtue.\nYet his thatched hut still recalls his lord—\nRight before the Ten-Thousand-Year Peak of Mount Song.\n\n---\n\n**A Letter on Behalf of Cheng Zhengshu**\n\nYour venerable father governs west of Sword Gate,\nHis filial joy a model for the world.\nThe Tang ministers’ grandeur is still clear today,\nWhile Shu’s people revel in past prosperity.\n\nWhere the Begonia Isle’s oars once paused,\nBy Golden Wild-Goose Bridge his horse once stood.\nI know he frets over the realm’s affairs—\nWho else but you would not forget your lord?\n\n---\n\n**Year’s End, Self-Admonition**\n\nOnce my ambitions soared like autumn’s might,\nNow, recalling them, I blush with shame.\nAll forced schemes end in petty toil,\nWhile the true Dao, unattained, drifts far away.\n\nIn stillness, one’s essence is hard to hide;\nIn old age, books gain deeper savor.\nAt ease, I converse with guests,\nYet piled memorials mislead lords and nobles.\n\nFortunate to be seen with favor by the wise,\nI heed not my wife and children’s complaints of gray hair.\nHow dare I compare to Zheng Zhen of Valley Mouth?\nOr scheme like the youths of Shouling?\n\nCauldron’s dragons and tigers, neglected in guard,\nChessboard’s rivers and mountains, abandoned in play.\nAwakening from a nap by the sunny window,\nA few soft bird calls just cease.\n\nThe finest woods and springs are bought with verse,\nThe fairest winds and moons repaid with wine.\nThree hundred and sixty days fly like arrows—\nHow could I let my heart sink into idle sorrow?\n\n---\n\n**Joyful Song, Fourth Year of Xining (1071)**\n\nAt sixty-one, my body is not yet frail.\nI’ve lived through two generations—\nHow could this be called an early end?\nMoreover, I am still hale,\nAnd free from care or vexation.\nWhy should I not rejoice?\nFine days are not few.\n\n---\n\n**To Li Jingzhen, Grand Master**\n\nBy the flowers, a quiet couch for idle rest,\nBeneath the bamboo, a bright window for solitary thought.\nWhat need for words to proclaim “the house is at peace”?\nThe green birds in the grove already know.\n\n---\n\n**Reflections**\n\nSnake’s head and lizard’s tail are not the same—\nKilling many is deemed a merit.\nThe four seasons’ winds and moons are infinitely fair—\nDo not let idle matters trouble your heart.\n\n---\n\n**To Qin Boming, Minister of War in Bozhou**\n\nThe land of Three Rivers lies at the center’s sun,\nIts qi nurtures rare blossoms to royal splendor.\nA connoisseur of fine flowers is not far—\nAnd fine flowers, ungrudging, offer full fragrance.\n\nFor years, worldly affairs have piled up,\nWhy frown before the blossoms?\nA thousand schemes turn hair to white—\nBetter to leave the heart unburdened.\n\nAmid boundless winds and moons, so full of feeling,\nLet rich wine flush your face.\nYet men create their own doubts and barriers,\nWeighing gains and losses, setting more traps.\n\nThough poor, I sleep late without harm;\nOthers may fret, but I am at ease.\nTempering worldly passions brings moments of joy—\nAnd fresh poems still number in the hundreds.\n\nWhere the heart returns is where the heart is absent,\nYet when the heart is absent, where can it be found?\nIf absence of heart meant absence of affairs,\nWhy then does gold form in water?\n\n---\n\n**Wine Holding Flower Shadows**\n\nWine brims with crimson, filled with flower shadows,\nPoured into the harmony of heaven and earth within my breast.\nI love best that singular savor—\nHalf-drunk, I am one with the Great Beginning.\n\n---\n\n**Another Farewell Poem**\n\nQin’s First Emperor once unified the Nine Provinces,\nYet the Nine Provinces soon passed to Liu.\nLet others boast of their brilliance—\nThey merely toil in vain, their hair turning white.\n\n---\n\n**Thinking of an Old Friend**\n\nThough the winecup is full,\nAn old friend a thousand *li* away—what can I do?\nWillows trail by the pavilion, their branches slender,\nFlowers near the eaves, their fragrance richer.\n\n---\n\n**Thanking Professor Wang Pingfu for Tea and a Poem on Flower-Viewing**\n\nThe Grand Academician knows flowers well,\nAnd in their essence, finds it through tea.\nAfter brewing amid ten thousand reds’ fragrance,\nHe sends the finest to the Celestial Ford’s first household.\n\n---\n\n**Viewing Flowers at Nanyuan**\n\nOn the third day of the third month, flowers in full bloom,\nI climb the spring terrace with kin and old friends.\nUsually sober, now I am drunk—\nAnd even drunk, I can still raise a great cup.\n\nBefore the flowers, I drink; before the flowers, I grow drunk,\nDrunk, I grasp the flower branches and sing.\nLet the flowers not laugh at this white-haired man—\nThe white-haired man has seen many fine flowers.\n\n---\n\n**Admiring Peonies Alone**\n\nViewing flowers is easy; knowing them is hard.\nOnly the connoisseur leans on the railing.\nIn rain and dew’s work, one sees creation’s art,\nIn immortals’ ranks, their beauty is fixed.\n\nCommon blooms may be called fashionable,\nBut only the extraordinary are deemed transcendent.\nOne’s allotted share is not shallow—\nIt takes a lifetime of leisure to deserve them.\n\n---\n\n**Asking Spring**\n\nIn the third month, spring departs and cannot be detained,\nSpring’s departure—how can its intent be entrusted?\nAll who speak of returning must return home—\nWhere, then, is spring’s home?\n\nWhere, after all, does spring return?\nCountless spring grievances remain unspoken.\nI would entrust the warbler to ask the reason,\nBut the cuckoo cries, “Better to go!”\n\nSpring comes, sorrow departs—all for the flowers;\nSpring goes, sorrow arrives—then clings to wine.\nLong resenting sorrow’s weight and wine’s weakness,\nDoes spring, now ill, know the flowers’ plight?\n\n---\n\n**Self-Admonition in the Peaceful Nest**\n\nThings, when well grasped, end in beauty;\nAffairs, when cunningly schemed, lack justice.\nNot stirring waves in the world,\nOne keeps ice and coals from the heart.\n\n**Disasters and Blessings**\n\nDisasters fall like autumn leaves before the frost,\nWealth and honor bloom red after the rain.\nCreation’s design is clear—yet none perceive it:\nHow much merit lies in withering and flourishing?\n\n**Exhortation Before Flowers**\n\nSpring lingers when drinking before the flowers,\nBut when spring departs, the flowers fade.\nTo face the flowers and not drink wine\nIs to let joy dwindle away.\nDrink wine before the flowers,\nAnd view them best when drunk.\nTo not drink wine before the flowers\nIs to waste a year’s delight.\n\n**After Writing *The Supreme Principles Governing the World***\n\nSimplicity scatters, and the human Dao is established;\nLaws begin with the Sovereign Fuxi.\nYears and months shift and change,\nYet records are hard to verify in detail.\nThe Two Emperors initiated abdication,\nThe Three Kings rectified the social order.\nThe Five Hegemons relied on strategic terrain,\nThe Seven States vied for supremacy.\nThe Two Han soared like dragons and phoenixes,\nThe Three Kingdoms fled like tigers and wolves.\nThe Western Jin indulged in refinement,\nWhile rebels flocked to the northern wastes.\nThe Eastern Jin cultivated purity,\nPassing its fragrance to Song, Qi, and Liang.\nBy the time of Chen, it was not worth reckoning—\nThe southern lands became a scene of sorrow.\nLater Wei exploited Jin’s weakness,\nSweeping away chaos to bring brief peace.\nYet before long after moving to Luoyang,\nRumors spread of eastern and western generals.\nNorthern Qi raised its flickering torch,\nLater Zhou raced like a shooting star.\nSui achieved unification,\nPaving the way for mighty Tang.\nThe Five Dynasties passed like inns,\nThe realm plunged into turmoil.\nHad no true lord emerged,\nHow could the center have been secured?\nA domain of ten thousand *li*,\nFour thousand years of rise and fall.\nFive hundred sovereigns took the throne,\nSeventy states carved out frontiers.\nSome unified the Six Directions,\nOthers controlled but a single region.\nSome founded dynasties early or late,\nOthers reigned briefly or long.\nSome rallied as their rule crumbled,\nOthers seized power in their prime.\nSome disasters arose without cause,\nSome fortunes turned to misfortune.\nSome perils came from outer defenses,\nOthers erupted within palace walls.\nSome ailments stemmed from allies,\nOthers festered in vital organs.\nLaughter and talk sowed strife,\nFeasts and banquets opened battlefields.\nA single outburst of desire,\nA clash of profit and harm.\nFierce struggles led to devouring,\nEndless calamities ensued.\nMountains and rivers barely marked the land,\nTombs and mounds soon lay desolate.\nBrambles were hard to clear,\nOrchids and irises failed to flourish.\nDragons and snakes slithered across the plains,\nJade and stone mingled on Kunlun’s slopes.\nThose who planned well were called Zhou or Confucius,\nThose who harmonized were deemed Lao or Zhuang.\nYet how can one speak of one’s own afflictions?\nHow can all cares be forgotten?\n\n**Gathering to Drink in the Dao**\n\nWhat the crowd delights in\nIs but clamor and dust.\nWhat my friends delight in\nIs pure fragrance alone.\nPure fragrance needs no music—\nIt dwells beside the distant past.\nThe distant past holds no other secret:\nHarmonious *qi* ever swirls.\nIn our village, old friendships thrive,\nWith talent and culture abounding.\nA single day’s visit brings joy,\nAs if the tenth month birthed spring.\nLuoyang, ancient sacred land,\nWhere the Duke of Zhou once expounded.\nThe four seasons keep their proper course,\nThe four directions lie equidistant.\nEach generation has its heroes,\nKnown for their many scholars.\nEven its flowers and trees\nAre unmatched in the world.\nTo encounter such a scene,\nAt such a moment,\nAnd to laugh aloud—\nHow many in the world can do so?\nPure hearts pierce metal and stone,\nLively discourse startles ghosts and gods.\nHeaven and earth become a single finger,\nWealth and rank like floating clouds.\nIn prosperous times, one eases relief efforts,\nBy daylight, one leisurely weaves plans.\nBetter to join the Wine Immortal,\nAnd once more face this noble one.\nSix hundred *li* of Shang and Yu,\nForty thousand catties of gold—\nCannot buy this joy,\nSo how can lesser things compare?\n\n**Tipsy Revelry**\n\nWhen the fence is breached and hats are askew,\nThe toad in the moon leaps to the sea’s edge.\nWhen the small cart is overturned,\nOne

people must be rare.\nIf creation brings them into being,\nIt is surely no easy feat.\nOne may hear of them across ages,\nOr see them in one’s own time.\nChen was a man of our time—\nWhy did I only hear of him by ear?\n\n**To the Four Zhang Brothers of Chengnan, Who Braved the Snow with Wine and Food**\n\nA drought had lasted nearly through winter,\nThe river guardian’s prayers went unanswered.\nThen, like geese in formation, you arrived,\nAnd suddenly a foot of fine snow fell.\nWine flushed your faces red,\nGuests’ hearts swelled with boundless joy.\nBy midnight, you left Tianjin,\nAnd Tianjin stood stark and silent.\n\n**Chant of the Great Cold**\n\nOld snow has yet to melt,\nNew snow piles against the door.\nBefore the steps, a frozen silver bed,\nFrom the eaves, icicles hang like stalactites.\nThe pale sun casts no glow,\nThe fierce wind howls in fury.\nEach person has a tongue,\nYet words cannot be spoken.\n\n**Matching Li Shenyan’s Poem on the Great Snow**\n\nA thousand trees of jade flowers bloom overnight,\nBlending with heaven and earth in dazzling white.\nThe pale moon goddess dances with slender waist,\nWhile deep in the white jade hall, another melody begins.\nThe scholar by the jarred window clutches his books,\nThe armored soldier on the battlefield moves in silence.\nThe reclusive man, his bones thin, nears emaciation—\nFortunate to have, now and then, a cup of wine.\n\n**The Small Cart**\n\nWhy not drink a thousand days’ wine in joy?\nWhy not cherish the four seasons’ flowers?\nWherever the small cart rolls, people rejoice,\nAnd all of Luoyang seems like home.\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Ren, Fiscal Commissioner of Zhe**\n\nOn the official path, I found a true friend—\nHow could I lightly betray Luoyang’s spring?\nThough three thousand *li* separate river and lake,\nLet not our hometown friends yearn too often.\n\n**Matching Song, Capital Official, Requesting Plum Blossoms (Fifth Year of Xining)**\n\nThough my small garden has four kinds of plum,\nNone bloom before the twelfth month like those south of the river.\nI long resent the East Lord’s lack of charm—\nHe refuses to release spring before its time.\n\n**Writing at the Eastern Pavilion as the Yellow and Red Plum Blossoms Bloom, Presented to a Friend**\n\nOnce a year, we see the twin plums,\nBut how many times can we see them bloom?\nAt sixty of a hundred-year lifespan,\nCease idle talk and raise your cup.\n\n**Matching Ren, Ministry Official, Recalling Plum Blossoms**\n\nI grieve that plum blossoms fade so soon,\nOnce withered, they are too haggard to behold.\nYear after year, their pure fragrance deceives—\nBetter to plant a few idle bamboos.\n\n**Weeping Willow**\n\nBefore the gate, the weeping willow sways,\nTossed by the east wind’s comings and goings.\nIt forgets that I am already old,\nMistaking itself for youth.\n\n**Chant of the Utmost Spirit**\n\nThe utmost spirit is called human,\nThe utmost nobility is called lord.\nIn brightness, there are sun and moon,\nIn obscurity, there are ghosts and gods.\n\n**Chant of Humans and Ghosts**\n\nIf one cannot serve humans,\nHow can one serve ghosts?\nThough humans and ghosts differ,\nTheir principles are never distinct.\n\n**Lifelong Exchange**\n\nThroughout life, in dealings with others,\nNever once have I tasted bitterness.\nI have never wronged another,\nNor have others ever harmed me.\n\n**Chant of Knowledge**\n\nWhat the eye sees is called perception,\nWhat the ear hears is called knowledge.\nYet how rare in this world\nAre true knowledge and perception.\n\n**Occasional Verses**\n\nIn wind, the forest has no still branches,\nOn wind, the pond has no calm waves.\nIf forest and pond are never still,\nWhat then of birds and fish?\n\n**Chant of Anticipating Misfortune**\n\nServants bully their masters,\nBarbarians invade the Central Kingdom.\nSince ancient times, injustice has been known,\nYet none can ever wholly eradicate it.\n\n**Two Poems Sent to Wang Xuanhui of Sancheng**\n\nThough my forest dwelling is humble,\nBefore the flowers, I drink often.\nIn this world, joy belongs to those without affairs—\nYet I fear it belongs only to the idle.\n\nDust rises on the road to your chamber,\nWhile in my pot, flowers just bloom.\nWhy wait until my hair is fully white\nBefore composing my homecoming verse?\n\n**Chant of Benevolence and Sagacity**\n\nTo exhaust the Dao is called sagacity,\nTo be like heaven is called benevolence.\nYet how is it that benevolence and sagacity\nDare not be matched in this world?\n\n**Matching Xing Heshu, Academician, Upon Parting**\n\nHow vast the world’s road stretches eastward—\nWe meet without needing words to convey.\nYou compare yourself to Zhuge Liang,\nWhile I am no Yellow Stone Elder.\n\nIn expounding the Dao, high or low, no matter great or small,\nIn speech, rise and fall have their beginnings and ends.\nTalent and achievement must be cherished in comings and goings—\nBeware of lightly following the ways of Western Jin.\n\n**Chant of Striking the Earth**\n\nThey say there are immortals in grottoes,\nBut tales of grotto immortals may be false.\nIf one awaits the ninefold elixir,\nOr seeks the vermilion crest for a thousand years—\n\nIn the Land of Longevity, a thousand trees of flowers,\nIn the Nest of Peace, joy overflows.\nWith joy, flowers, and wine,\nI doubt not that I am a grotto immortal.\n\n**Chant of Spring’s Departure**\n\nFine things are hard to come by,\nYet all vanish in a few days.\nFirst tossed by wind,\nThen ravaged by rain.\n\nThe drunkard awakens from wealth’s stupor,\nThe dream of immortality suddenly fades.\nThe wanderer, unaware of when to stop,\nStill leans on the crimson balustrade.\n\n**Flowers and Bamboo in the Southern Garden**\n\nFlower paths and bamboo trails press close together,\nEach day I walk them four or five times.\nI let the flower paths encroach on the bamboo,\nThat the bamboo trails may face the blooming flowers.\n\nFragrance drifts far, clinging to sleeves,\nBamboo shadows layer upon the wine cups.\nWho says the mountain elder lacks warmth?\nSuch reds and greens ever embrace.\n\n**Two Responses to Wang Xuanhui**\n\nOur Confucians have their own joy,\nYet few are willing to follow it.\nTo take Chan as joy\nIs but to raise another layer of dust.\n\n**Again**\n\nThe greatly enlightened are truly unobstructed,\nEach person has their own home.\nEven false flowers occupy the mind—\nWhat then can be called true flowers?\n\n**Azure Chant: Sent in Reply to Li Shenyan, Dragon Diagram Scholar of Caozhou**\n\nThe same hue, ever azure,\nFrom ancient times to now, people gaze and cry out in sorrow.\nSun goes, moon comes, with little change,\nYang’s warmth and yin’s chill do not hinder each other.\n\nAfter thunder’s swift crack, mountains and rivers split,\nWhen sweet dew falls, grasses and trees grow fragrant.\nIn dark cliffs, ghosts and demons arise,\nOn clear plains, phoenixes appear.\n\nA thousand flowers bloom in spring’s rain,\nTen thousand trees wither in a night’s frost.\nThis meaning is hard to fathom—\nOnly the worthy can enter its depths.\n\n**Five Chants from the Forest**\n\nThe true artisan of creation allows no favoritism,\nThe clumsy schemer’s plans are ever slight.\nAfter rising from my Nest of Peace,\nHalf-drunk on the rich brew of Great Harmony.\n\nIn the Land of Longevity, I go with basket in hand,\nIn the Land of Ever-Ripe Grain, I return with staff.\nMy body, like the age of peace, knows no trouble—\nA few white whiskers let the wind blow as it will.\n\n**Old Age**\n\nThe body of old age demands warmth,\nIn the Nest of Peace, spring is ever present.\nAll affairs leave the heart, free to recline or rise,\nMy four limbs obey me, stretching or bending.\n\nWhere garden flowers bloom thick, cool mats are spread,\nWhen eaves snow flies, soft quilts are laid.\nWho says the mountain elder is clumsy in use?\nHe too can nurture his own well-being.\n\n**The Light and Pure**\n\nThere is a thing, light and pure, called Great Harmony,\nHalf-drunk, it best captures spring’s abundance.\nCan the elixir of immortality truly change bones?\nCan ascending to heaven in broad daylight be so?\n\nWhen joy is full, I rise and dance,\nAt the point of forgetting words, I only sing.\nDo not blame friends for my lack of restraint—\nTrue joy assails the heart, and I cannot help it.\n\n**Inviting Each Other**\n\nWe invite and urge each other to drink rosy clouds,\nHair tangled like autumn frost, temples streaked with blossoms.\nWhat we recall are but past years,\nMost of what we’ve experienced belongs to old officials.\n\nTogether we praise the grandson’s visit today,\nSpeaking again of old times.\nWords are tender, full of feeling—\nLet not the young laugh at our fussing.\n\n**Born Without Tilling**\n\nBorn without ever tending fields,\nYet every year, every season, there is harvest.\nWith cups and plates as they come, all is joy,\nCasual ponds and pavilions become excursions.\n\nWind, flowers, snow, moon—worth a thousand gold,\nWater, bamboo, clouds, mountains—worth ten thousand households.\nAwaiting the Yellow River’s clarity, how long can man live?\nHow much sorrow can the brows bear?\n\n**Self-Admonition in the Nest of Peace**\n\nI do not lash my whip toward the red dust,\nSeeking only to reduce faults, yet still without means.\nIn vain, I recall the days of knowing my errors,\nMistakenly passing the years reading the *Yi* with Confucius.\n\nWhen hair turns white, it’s hard to receive color,\nWhen the heart attains thoroughness, what more is there to say?\nThe qi of utmost yang becomes jade—\nYet I fear the drilling and polishing are not yet firm enough.\n\n**Two Poems Matching Junshi, Minister of the Flower Hermitage**\n\nNo need for cinnabar pillars or carved beams,\nLayer upon layer, green shade naturally hangs.\nLater generations, inheriting this natural intent,\nShould not seek to add embellishment with planted shade.\n\nBehind and before the hermitage, all is planted with flowers,\nBlooming in turn, lovely in all four seasons.\nThe master’s affairs are simple, often at leisure—\nHe does not believe that the years can age him.\n\n*Yichuan Jirang Ji, Volume Eight Concludes*\n*Yichuan Jirang Ji, Volume Nine*\n\n**At Sixty-Two, by Shao Yong of Yichuan**\n\nAt sixty-two, still hale and strong,\nDeath but returns me to the land of eternal ripeness.\nFair scenes and fine hours are not easily won—\nWhat harm in sipping lightly and singing low?\nBoundless years defy all constraint,\nFrail flesh and bone must not be harmed.\nHow many heroes have wielded wit and skill—\nYet few have pondered deeply the ills they bring.\n\n**Chant on the Game Beneath the Trees**\n\nEven the idle have their duties,\nAnd these four fill my days:\nOne, to greet dawn’s dew and watch the flowers;\nOne, to welcome evening’s breeze and gaze upon the willows;\nOne, to face the bright moon and chant poems;\nOne, to keep fine guests and pour the wine.\nFor twenty years I’ve lived thus—\nWho among my peers could match this life?\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Attendant Councillor Wu Chuanzheng’s Gift**\n\nFifty years spent poring over old books—\nThe world must think me dull and out of touch.\nYet I recall the weaver’s daughter, lost in time,\nAnd grasp the wheelwright’s art of swift and slow.\nMy Daoist practice lacks refinement—this is my true flaw,\nThough my livelihood is meager, I dare not call it vain.\nIn this age of harmony, I’ve received much—\nHow could my heart not rest in perfect ease?\n\n**Poem for Academician Li of Yanfu Ward, Who Requested My Garden and Pond**\n\nNineteen times the banners of might were unfurled,\nA family of meritorious generals through the generations.\nIn this peaceful age, you left glory behind to return home,\nWhite-haired, passing the years in joy.\nCups brim with fragrant wine, afloat on spring waters,\nNew melodies rise from the depths of fair blossoms.\nWith such a garden, such a pond, such longevity—\nYour descendants fill your eyes with boundless blessing.\n\n**Chant on Gold and Jade**\n\nFine gold and fair jade are never paired by chance,\nThe finest things often lie buried deepest.\nRobber Zhi wielded troops yet did no good,\nWhile Confucius, landless, was met with suspicion.\nIf *zhongfu* demands trust to be true,\nWhy does *wuwang* bring disaster in its train?\nBetter to treat them as matters external—\nThe wellspring of the heart is joy, radiant and clear.\n\n**Summer Day in the Southern Garden**\n\nSummer trees, uncounted in their layers,\nCast deep shade where emerald leaves droop low.\nA hundred birds call to one another—\nMost are orioles, their voices bright.\n**For Attendant Councillor Xie of the Southern Office, Who Sent a Vessel of Xi Yi’s Wine**\n\nThe peaks of Xian Zhang stand sheer, unyielding,\nSince Xi Yi and Chen Tunan passed, none have matched them.\nThey poured with a hand raised high for worldly affairs,\nSipped with a tilt of the head for human feeling.\nTo paint a tiger and fail—yet the heart remains;\nTo mourn the qilin with no response—tears stream down.\nBut enlightenment comes without many words—\nThe first prize is to win this pure leisure.\n\n**Matching Junshi, Minister of the Flower Hermitage, on Sitting Alone**\n\nSitting in stillness, nurturing the harmony of Heaven,\nI have gained much from this practice.\nVast as a hall, yet dense with vines and creepers,\nI forget the bearing of a noble minister,\nAnd can welcome even rustic visitors.\nBound by the times’ joys and sorrows,\nIn the end, I know not what to say.\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Capital Official Song’s Gift of a Palm-Leaf Whisk**\n\nLuoyang has long been called a secondary capital,\nYet it has sheltered even one as unworthy as I.\nWhere countless mosquitoes hum like thunder,\nHow can a single whisk hope to sweep them all away?\n\n**With Academician Wang Shengzhi, Admiring the Peonies of the Western Garden**\n\nThis flower is famed in Yangzhou,\nBut here by the Luo River, it is prized above all.\nI know well its royal beauty can move all things,\nAnd its heavenly fragrance binds men’s hearts in secret.\nIt crowns the host of blossoms, reigning through summer,\nHolding its rare perfection without need of spring.\nAs the sun slants low, I mount my horse to leave—\nYet turn once more to lean on the crimson rail and gaze.\n\n**Playfully Thanking the Wealthy Minister for His Gift of Banana and Bamboo Shoots (Three Poems)**\n\nA renowned garden where not even crows may fly,\nYet now the Minister deigns to send for me.\nFeasts from tripods have long been called wealth and honor—\nNow he pairs them with flowers and bamboo shoots.\n\nYou send great shoots to startle me,\nWhile my small garden yields none at all.\nThough I’ve striven to temper my nature,\nHow can I remain unmoved today?\n\nThe work of responding to things lies beyond the world—\nWho can force their way to such heights?\nI am but a man who knows not his limits,\nSeeking to heap molehills to match Mount Tai.\n\n**In Reply to Li Xichun, Field Officer**\n\nThough born in prosperous times, what can I do?\nMy nature and wit are too slight for great deeds.\nMy flawed disposition suits only the curling of the inchworm,\nMy meager talent dares not aspire to the flight of the roc.\nOften I visit old friends, joy without end,\nOr seek quiet places, returning late at dusk.\nI love flowers best when half-open, touched by dew—\nYet how can I bear the dew that soaks my robe?\n\n**Moss-Coin**\n\nAfter each rain, it renews itself,\nNot through frequent minting.\nThough plentiful, it cannot be given to guests,\nAnd if lost, no one suspects theft.\nCovering the ground does not make one rich,\nFilling the steps cannot relieve the poor.\nTo drown sorrow, one must have a cause—\nTo buy wine, there is no reason at all.\nScattered, it resembles counting rods;\nPiled high, it seems a tangled rope.\nUnable to aid one’s own urgent needs,\nHow can it spare help for kin?\n\n**Chant on Sowing Grain**\n\nFarmers sow grain in season,\nPlanting millet, not weeds.\nYet why, before the millet thrives,\nDo the weeds flourish first?\nIf weeds are not uprooted,\nThe millet will never ripen.\nWorse still, when both need water,\nThe weeds steal the nourishment meant for the grain.\n\n**Matching Minister Junshi’s Gift**\n\nI have never seen such clamor,\nEven in the heart of the city, it resembles distant outskirts.\nThough I lack a thousand-mile steed,\nI have found a branch to nest upon.\nThe moon rises behind cloud-wreathed mountains,\nThe wind stirs the tips of pines and bamboos.\nWhat have I truly gained?\nSurely I need not shun the world’s mockery.\n\n**Autumn Night**\n\nFloating clouds disperse,\nStars and constellations gleam across the endless sky.\nGreen moss clings to crimson fruit,\nPure fragrance rises from white lotuses.\nMy body, still cool, wears linen,\nMy ears, now quiet, hear no cicadas.\nSitting long, all movement ceases—\nThe autumn sky is utterly still.\n\n**On Revisiting My Garden in Autumn, I Take Up My Bamboo Staff and Don My Sable Robe—Both Gifts from Jingren—And, Seeing Them, Think of Him and Write This Poem**\n\nThe bamboo staff has long been my companion,\nThe sable robe, though spread anew, is still fresh.\nGradually it bears the snow of Min Mountain,\nBrushing away the dust of the capital.\nIt steadies my steps on the drunken path home,\nFits my ailing body with ease.\nThanks to these treasures from my study,\nAt times I feel as if I see my old friend again.\n\n**Clouds**\n\nThe clear sky is bluer than water—\nHow can a single cloud take flight?\nCatching the sunlight, it becomes a vermilion phoenix;\nFollowing the wind, it turns to white raiment.\nComing and going, it leaves no trace,\nHidden or revealed, it forgets all cunning.\nWho can fathom Heaven’s principle?\nIn the end, where does it belong?\n\n**Leisure**\n\nIn leisure, I observe all things—\nEverywhere, there is freedom.\nFish are hooked for their greed,\nMoths are scorched for rushing into flame.\n\n**The Azure Wutong and the Phoenix**\n\nThe azure wutong starves the phoenix,\nWhile white grains sate the wren.\nWho is this rope-girt youth?\nHe sings as he gathers firewood.\n\n**The Flowering Arbor’s Morning Glories**\n\nThe arbor blooms with morning glories—\nAt dawn they open, by sunrise they wither.\nThough their flowers are fair, none linger to admire.\nGazing afar, clouds cling to the peaks;\nHer makeup done, her kingfisher pins scatter.\nA gauze pouch cradles the morning dew,\nA jade parasol brushes the autumn mist.\nTheir longing is not like the sunflower’s,\nYet they fade before the hibiscus.\nFit only for a fleeting glance,\nThey waste the day in idle sleep.\n\n**Matching \"Autumn Night\"**\n\nLong I dreaded summer’s heat,\nNow I welcome autumn’s night.\nSudden rain meets towering bamboo,\nCool winds sway the evening lotus.\nHow could withered sedge crickets\nOutlast the failing willow’s cicadas?\nIf only I had a bird of the marsh,\nIts clear cry would wash me clean.\n\n**Matching \"Sable Robe and Bamboo Staff\" (Both Gifts from Fan Jingren)**\n\nThe noble man preserves all things,\nCherishing the old, not the new.\nThe staff grows from Shu’s rocky cliffs,\nThe sable runs through Yin Mountain’s dust.\nIt steadies treacherous paths,\nWarms a frail and ailing frame.\nNever set aside in motion or stillness,\nIt is as if I see the giver again.\n\n**Matching \"Clouds\"**\n\nThe sky’s canopy stretches boundless,\nA single cloud drifts alone.\nIt knows only to cling to stone,\nNot to become heaven’s raiment.\nComing, it has no intent;\nGoing, it needs no device.\nIf it cannot bring timely rain,\nWhy return to the imperial realm?\n\n**Matching \"Leisure\"**\n\nObserve all things through the self—\nTheir principles are never distant.\nHorses grow lean from too much riding,\nTortoises burn from scorching divination.\nThe parrot may speak, yet still be caged;\nThe wren eats its fill with ease.\nThe mist and waters of Yi and Luo are fine—\nWould that I could share them with fisher and woodcutter.\n\n**Matching \"The Flowering Arbor’s Morning Glories\"**\n\nLeaves clamor thick as a cock’s crow,\nFlowers bloom dense as kingfisher pins.\nDew glistens cold at dawn,\nMist veils the clear day’s haze.\nTheir blooms follow in ordered turns,\nYet open and close without sequence.\nThe master stands long in vain vigil,\nEver forsaking his morning rest.\n\n**Two Quatrains to Old Friend Wei of the Three Cities**\n\nThough aged, I am not yet feeble,\nChrysanthemums crowd my fence.\nThe weather turns crisp and fine,\nNeighbors gather in good cheer.\n\nThe scene is fair, our bodies hale,\nThe sky clear, the road dry.\nA light carriage on soft grass rides smooth,\nEverywhere, pure delight.\n\n**Autumn Day on the Stone Pavilion**\n\nFirst clear skies, I lean on the monk’s pavilion rail,\nThe world grows bleak in the eighth month.\nI test my strength on the uppermost floor,\nGazing from on high at the mortal realm.\nAutumn deepens, the weather suits me well;\nIn old age, my heart loves only leisure.\nI bid the distant mountains hold their hue—\nSuch feelings have long since faded.\n\n**Matching Li Shenyan’s \"Traveling Past Longmen\"**\n\nA thousand miles of autumn light fills my seat,\nOur friendship rejoices in smiles of welcome.\nThe chrysanthemums await the Double Ninth,\nAs if saving their bloom for your cup of wine.\n\n**Chant on Wind and Moon**\n\nCool winds are boundlessly pure,\nBright moons are boundlessly clear.\nPurity and clarity never forsake me,\nEver fostering joy.\nAll day, threefold shame;\nAll day, threefold honor.\nIf honor and shame touch me not,\nWhat cause have I for alarm?\n\n**To Minister Fu**\n\nThe world strikes at joy and sorrow,\nWho in this age can compare?\nThree reigns as prime minister,\nFour rivers as a man of leisure.\nIlluminating all things through the ages,\nHe gathers back the one true essence.\nI know not why,\nYet he treats me with such warmth.\n\n**Chant on Wielding the Brush**\n\nWhat man values is spirit,\nYet spirit, once possessed, is not pure.\nFeigning truth from falsehood remains false,\nDiligence to mask clumsiness still falls short.\nHunger sated brings sickness,\nSeeking cure from sickness brings no true peace.\nMany err in mistaking the sage,\nBut the sage never errs with the world.\n\n**Inviting Sima Junshi to Stroll the Summer Garden**\n\nThe rain has cleared, the scene is fine,\nAutumn deepens, the air not yet cold.\nMight you join me in high spirits?\nLet us linger awhile in the summer garden.\n\n**Autumn Day After Rain, Gazing Idly**\n\nWater gleams, clouds scatter, frost comes early,\nThough late in the year, the yellow blooms are fair.\nThough encircled by distant mountains on all sides,\nA single slice of autumn light grows old.\nHeaven creates all things without partiality,\nYet sages’ deeds baffle mortal understanding.\nCommon words need no boast—\nEven mediocre talent suffices.\n\n**Four Short Verses for Chen Jichang**\n\nThe eighth month is a small spring,\nSmall flowers bloom in profusion.\nEvening brings a light rain,\nLeaving the small carriage idle.\n\n**Chant on Joy**\n\nI ever delight in joy,\nJoy that harms no righteousness.\nJoy in heaven’s four seasons,\nJoy in earth’s myriad things.\nJoy in men’s fine conduct,\nJoy in one’s own joyful deeds.\nBeyond these joys,\nI joy in the faintest intoxication.\n\n**Chant Admonishing My Son**\n\nGood and evil lie in where they dwell,\nDividing petty men from gentlemen.\nTo change course harms not one’s gentlemanly nature;\nTo persist in error is to become a petty man.\nGood medicine cures when it benefits the ailment,\nWhite jade is prized only when flawless.\nTo forge a fine vessel requires cutting and polishing—\nHow can faults not be made anew?\n\n**On Hearing Shaohua Mountain’s Collapse**\n\nChange leaves no trace in an instant,\nYet moving heaven and earth is no hard task.\nIf the giant spirit but stretched its hand,\nWould Shaohua Mountain’s rise be all?\nSix villages’ folk are swallowed,\nNine springs’ boulders overturned.\nA woodcutter’s single word could be heeded—\nEven in Yao and Shun’s time, it could be done.\n\n**Chant on the Ancients**\n\nSince ancient times, even great sages\nFound matters difficult.\nHow much more for later men—\nCould they so easily attain it?\nSeeking it is endlessly hard,\nYet gaining it is effortless.\nA thousand, ten thousand hearts,\nBut only one heart is right.\n\n**Letter in Place of Writing to Old Friend Zu Longtu**\n\nThirty years of old friendship,\nMeeting now with white-haired heads.\nWe once drank on the sea’s edge,\nRoamed the Luo Society together.\nShedding the world’s storms,\nWe opened our hearts in pine and cassia autumn.\nFrom now on, our brows\nShould bear no idle sorrow.\n\n**Chant on a Cold Night**\n\nThe sky adds a layer of cold,\nI add a layer to my quilt.\nI speak no words of the past,\nNor do what is excessive.\nI blame myself strictly and thoroughly,\nDemand little of others.\nOnly the great sage\nCan stand in a place without fault.\n\n**Chant on Knowing Fortune**\n\nThe cock’s duty is to herald dawn,\nThe dog’s duty is to guard.\nBoth serve their roles,\nYet all returns to serving their lord.\n\n**On Hunger and Cold**\n\nWhen I hunger, I too partake of food;\nWhen I am cold, I too receive clothing.\nYet how is it I possess not a thread of merit\nTo repay the age?\n\n**Trends**\n\nAbandoning my divine tortoise,\nI observe my own chewing jaws.\nTurning from righteousness to profit,\nMan lacks far-reaching thought.\n\n**Gifts in Retirement**\n\nAdorned in rustic gardens,\nSilk bundles meager yet bound.\nHaving plotted the great,\nThe small lies within.\n\n**Chant on the Unknowable**\n\nThe plow-ox sprouts crimson horns,\nThe aged oyster yields a luminous pearl.\nThough men may wish not to use them,\nCan mountains and rivers forsake them?\n\nAffairs are fundamentally unknowable,\nThings too are hard to constrain.\nOnce reduced to mere conjecture,\nRighteousness loses its precision.\n\n**Chant on Urgency**\n\nAt dawn’s extremity, one longs for rain;\nIn mortal illness, the heart seeks medicine.\nIn such moments for all,\nNo urging is needed to deepen resolve.\n\n**Chant on Knowing Others**\n\nObserve demeanor in times of urgency,\nReveal the liver and spleen in peril.\nDeep hearts and composed faces may deceive in peace—\nBeware of claiming easy knowledge.\n\n**Chant on Speech**\n\nA single word brings delight,\nA thousand words stir greater wrath.\nThough speech may unite,\nIt is speech that divides.\n\n**Chant on Anticipating Misfortune**\n\nAdornment nears empty vanity,\nYet empty vanity breeds deep misfortune.\nTo cure hunger, use food;\nTo relieve drought, require rain.\n\n**Chant on a Human Lifetime**\n\nA hundred million years lie ahead,\nA hundred million years stretch behind.\nBetween them, a hundred years—\nHow much can one accomplish?\n\nEven the lifespan of a tile,\nFew reach a hundred years.\nWhy not rejoice,\nForcing oneself into sorrow?\n\n**Thanks for the Gift of a Stone Zither**\n\nWho took Heaven’s Pillar Peak,\nAnd with a swift blade cleaved it in half?\nWhere springs once trickled, faint traces remain,\nWhere clouds embraced, their hue still lingers.\n\nNeither the gates of power could move it,\nNor the halls of wealth turn it away.\nWhat am I then,\nTo be offered as tribute to the Lord of the Underworld?\n\n**Matching the Poem on First Snow, Tenth Month Twenty-Fourth Day, Presented to the Prime Minister and Elder**\n\nOn *renzi*, snow first arrives,\nSparse, then retreats to clear skies.\nThe world turns wholly white,\nThe forest beneath cannot bear its purity.\n\nThe cold scholar suffers dread,\nThe destitute tremble in fear.\nWith new laws restricting cups,\nWhy should they readily empty?\n\n**Matching the Prime Minister and Elder**\n\nLofty towers have not yet celebrated,\nAuspicious snow descends from cloud’s edge.\nThough the earth is all white,\nThe heavens are not so cold.\n\nA bountiful year may be awaited,\nAn inch of moisture hard to dry.\nLet not the furrows be forgotten,\nTrace the joy of *jirang* in the fields.\n\n**At Tianjin Viewing Snow: A Letter in Place of Thanks to Scholar Jiang for Returning a Poetry Scroll**\n\nThe clear Luo flows to the heavens,\nCold clouds skim the earth in flight.\nOne stands upon the bridge,\nPoetry returns through the snow.\n\n**Viewing Snow in the Abode of Peace and Joy**\n\nLayered clouds, drifting snow—\nWithin the Abode of Peace and Joy, gazing outward.\nFirst marveling at the jade trees of the rear garden,\nThen astonished by the shimmering Jasper Pool on level ground.\n\nBefore the Cold Food Festival, pear blossoms fade,\nBefore spring winds, willow fluff takes flight.\nWine leaves me half-drunk, the curtain half-raised—\nLet not this feeling be known to outsiders.\n\n**A World of Jade**\n\nAll before my eyes is jade,\nThe poor household thus grows rich.\nPermitted to admire, not to sell,\nFitting for sorrow, not for ease.\n\nAfter fine brew induces warmth,\nLayered robes sustain the heat.\nWould I dare, in this mortal realm,\nTo weigh gain and loss by the slightest measure?\n\n**Responding to Minister Fu Han’s New Year’s Four Quatrains, Xining Sixth Year**\n\nFour poems for the New Year,\nCelebrating seventy years.\nConsider the precedents of Tang—\nEven the Duke of Jin was not permitted to retire.\n\n**Matching Junshi and Duangming**\n\nCultivating the Dao in tranquil ease,\nFrosted hair grows as it will.\nFree from official blame,\nFortunate to escape worldly suspicion.\n\nA thatched door suffices for contentment,\nA broth of greens is never sated.\nOne peculiar joy—\nBasking in the sun before the eaves.\n\n**Four Joys of the Abode of Peace and Joy**\n\nIn the Abode of Peace and Joy, a joyful man,\nAt leisure, four treasures gladly keep him company.\nOne volume of poetry, carefree, gathers moon and flowers,\nOne tome of scripture, stern, astonishes ghosts and spirits.\n\nOne stick of incense, pure, uplifts the cosmos,\nOne cup of wine, fine, immerses in heaven’s truth.\nRejoicing in this great peace—how much more?\nOnly wishing the lord’s life span ten thousand springs.\n\n**A Volume of Poetry in the Abode of Peace and Joy**\n\nA volume of poetry in the Abode of Peace and Joy,\nSinging to myself, chanting to myself, I find contentment.\nRefining water and stone in idle endeavor,\nDiscerning wind and blossoms in quiet authority.\n\nThoughts take flight, suddenly mounting a thousand-mile steed,\nInspiration arises, first ascending the nine-tiered heavens.\nWhen the mood strikes, altering a word or two,\nDrunk, I chant five or seven verses.\n\nNow fearing my heart communes with the moon beyond snow,\nNow suspecting my body is an immortal in a cave.\nThe Silver River surges, churning waves in clear skies,\nJade trees gnarled, birthing purple mist.\n\nAll things with feeling may be depicted,\nAll bones free of illness cannot be purged.\nEntrusted with themes, I am aided by spirits,\nMy lines, mistakenly, are spread by others.\n\nWould I yield to noble houses’ constant music,\nOr feel shame before wealthy chambers’ excess wealth?\nIf tallying such faults, how boundless they would be—\nWhy then do censors alone remain silent?\n\n**A Tome in the Abode of Peace and Joy**\n\nA tome in the Abode of Peace and Joy,\nTitled *The August Ultimate*—what does it intend?\n*Spring and Autumn*, rites and music, can they be abandoned?\nFather and son, lord and minister—can they be abolished?\n\nVast, the era after Fuxi and Xuanyuan’s creation,\nMajestic, the harmony of Yao and Shun’s beginning.\nFiery, Tang and Wu beyond war,\nTurbulent, Huan and Wen beyond swords and bows.\n\nSun, moon, and stars shine brightly,\nKings, emperors, and lords’ voices resound grandly.\nThousands of rulers emerge with regulations,\nHundreds of millions of years form models.\n\nLong governance breeds fear of overbearing power,\nDeep troubles still call for the expulsion of evil.\nTalents fit to command an age arise in their time,\nWisdom to aid the age is never absent.\n\nThe past is all subject to idle commentary,\nThe future must await another’s support.\nWho is the master of creation,\nTo birth so many extraordinary men?\n\n**A Stick of Incense in the Abode of Peace and Joy**\n\nA stick of incense in the Abode of Peace and Joy,\nBurned at dawn with no ordinary intent.\nDisasters like these spare men from flattery,\nFortunes sought would outmeasure heaven.\n\nUnlike the black and yellow robes beseeching temple statues,\nNor like children and girls perfuming their garments.\n*Sincerity* arises—why trouble with prayer?\n*Unwarranted* calamity—hard to dispel.\n\nThe empty chamber, cool and white,\nThe numinous terrace, bright and still, glows anew.\n\n**Gazing at the Wind, Warding Off Bandits**\n\nGazing at the wind, warding off bandits—heart still drunk,\nFacing the scene, like Yan Yuan, he sits in perfect forgetfulness.\nIn the Red Waters lies a pearl, cradling creation’s essence,\nWithin the Muddy Pellet, no thing bars the azure vault.\n\nBorn a man, still strong in body,\nMeeting a flourishing age, the year abundant.\nSun and moon shine down—achievements vast,\nSovereign and minister shelter—how enduring their merit?\n\nNot merely hearing the Dao has brought one to this,\nGold and jade—whose halls are not filled to overflowing?\n\n**A Cup of Wine in the Abode of Peace and Joy**\n\nA cup of wine in the Abode of Peace and Joy,\nNot only to nurture qi, but to follow the true.\nSipped again and again, lightly drunk,\nPatting one’s breast—all within is spring.\n\nNo different from sovereign and minister at first meeting,\nNor unlike heaven and earth at the dawn of boundless expanse.\nThe intoxicated savor—hard to name,\nThe brewing craft—impossible to describe.\n\nPouring holds depths, governed by harmonious principle,\nDrinking knows no measure, entrusted with great schemes.\nBeneath the Phoenix Tower, a carefree wanderer,\nWithin the walls of Jiaoru, a man at ease.\n\nFrom the high pavilion, the view—flowers like brocade,\nWhere the small carriage rolls—grass like a carpet.\nUnfurling and rolling up, the hand of rise and fall through ages,\nEmerging and entering, a body of a thousand layers of clouds and waters.\n\nAfter rain, quietly observing the mountain’s intent,\nBefore the wind, idly watching the moon’s spirit.\nSuch endeavors—weighed and distinguished,\nEven ancient heroes, I fear, have not heard of them.\n\n**On Chancellor Xie Fu’s Presentation of a New Scroll of Poetry**\n\nA thoroughfare chosen, half planted with pines and bamboos,\nAn elder statesman resigns honor in a flourishing age.\nPlanting fine flowers to contemplate the nature of things,\nEach draft of pure wine stirs the celestial truth.\n\nThe clear court will match the deeds of former years,\nThe jade grotto immortal—today’s body.\nMore still—twenty new poems,\nEach word a rival to the radiance of spring.\n\nLiterature is the realm’s shared vessel,\nPoetry, within literature, is no less refined.\nOnly by entering its nature does one know its true savor,\nOnly by attaining the divine does one see its wondrous craft.\n\nLeisurely observing the wax and wane of years,\nSilently reflecting the presence and absence of heaven and earth.\nIts diction surpasses *Li Sao* in warmth and grace,\nThough *Li Sao* lacks such ease and breadth.\n\n**Delighting in Playful Verses in the Abode of Peace and Joy**\n\nIn the Abode of Peace and Joy, how fine to play the rogue,\nTo play the rogue—age must take its turn.\nIn bitter cold and scorching heat, doors stay shut,\nWhen mild warmth and early cool arrive, one ventures out.\n\nWind and moon urge brush and ink,\nOrioles and flowers draw one near wine jars.\nAsk why one can live thus—\nOnly because talent nurtures the untalented.\n\n**Matching Vice-Director Junshi’s Ascent of the Stone Pavilion**\n\nThough the plain stretches far,\nWho knows each thing renewed?\nA perilous tower, a hundred feet high,\nHolds ten thousand springs apart.\n\n**Matching Vice-Director Junshi’s Wine-Ode**\n\nLuoyang’s flowers and trees bloom across the city,\nFurther gifting the eastern capital’s paired flasks.\nThus do idle men turn wild,\nYet how can the red sun not sink in the west?\n\n**Chanting Before Flowers**\n\nSpring abides in flowers’ rivalry for beauty,\nSpring departs—flowers wither in its wake.\nFine flowers cannot be detained,\nNor can fine guests easily meet.\n\nWine is drunk before flowers,\nFlowers are best viewed with wine in hand.\nWhy pour another full cup?\nTo exhaust this moment’s joy.\n\n**To Li Xichun, Agricultural Commissioner in Chengdu, in Rhyme**\n\nI think of you, yet you do not return,\nYou linger in your Sichuan post.\nThough white-haired and weary,\nA pure heart should find its own ease.\n\nFlower season—hard to meet,\nSilkworm market—easy to rejoice.\nDo not sigh at retirement’s delay,\nLife’s toil is not yet done.\n\n**Letter in Place of Li Zundu, Imperial Commissioner in Guangxin**\n\nA thousand *li* beyond Jibei,\nHan and Tang marked the frontier’s edge.\nYet how is it today’s land\nNo longer bears its old mountains and rivers?\n\nThe tiger’s tent—warriors revere it,\nThe carved bow—passed to heirs.\nWhen the day comes to inscribe merit,\nLet none fall short of later Yanran.\n\n**Self-Matching \"Playful Verses\"**\n\nIn the Abode of Peace and Joy, how fine to play the rogue,\nKnowing full well I lack surpassing talent.\nOld age brings many ills, yet I take no medicine,\nYouth’s bold heart has long turned to ash.\n\nCourtyard grass, though cut, never fully vanishes,\nRailing flowers, though tended, struggle to bloom.\nA light breeze stirs half-drunken wine—\nThis joy comes straight from beyond the heavens.\n\n*Yichuan’s \"Striking the Earth\" Collection, Volume Nine Concludes*\n*Yichuan’s \"Striking the Earth\" Collection, Volume Ten*\n\n**Thirteen Poems on Encountering Spring in Old Age**\n\n**I**\nOld age meets spring—do not suspect its guile,\nFor in these years, youth’s return I revere.\nMen’s hearts grow cold, wine fails to cheer,\nThe sky stays chill, the flowers refuse to appear.\nBeyond the dyke, wind bends the willows aslant,\nBeneath the wall, rain nurtures moss half-grown.\nLast year’s waves flowed eastward, gone for good—\nWhy then does fresh green rise anew?\n\n**II**\nOld age meets spring—spring now in full array,\nIts splendor bright before the Smoke-Prohibition Day.\nJust chilled, then warmed, the season tends the flowers,\nRain’s voice departs, the sky clears for wine’s hours.\nTo pour or pause, the cups must know their lord,\nTo plant the peach and plum—who holds the sway?\nPure talk already stirs the heart to joy,\nYet wild verse I take for strings to play.\n\n**III**\nOld age meets spring—rain just now cleared,\nAnd clearer still, the approach of Pure Bright near.\nThe sky hangs low o’er palace halls, the days grow long,\nThe garden warm, but orioles still hold their song.\nFrom lofty towers, the flowers seem brocade,\nWhere grass is thick as matting, carriages glide.\nHow generous the Lord of Spring’s decree—\nOnce more the world enjoys long peace.\n\n**IV**\nOld age meets spring—do not weary of its stay,\nLiving now by Heaven’s Ford, how fine the day.\nWith water and bamboo as life’s design,\nI must become the master of wind and bloom.\nThe old estate’s debris I clear away,\nNew beds I tend with care, planting orchid’s perfume.\nI know not if beyond this quiet land\nAnother place could hold this frame of mine.\n\n**V**\nOld age meets spring—now first I know its grace,\nYet fear its beauty belongs to idle hands alone.\nWho grasps the Lord of Blue’s great artistry?\nHow dare I vie with youth’s unruly throng?\nWine from young brew I taste for its pure tone,\nFlowers in dawn’s dew I watch for their bright spirit’s song.\nAll rare things are hard to entrust—\nYet Nature never fails the one who belongs.\n\n**VI**\nOld age meets spring—spring’s moods abound,\nWho dyes the waves? Who twists the willow’s crown?\nBy pond and pavilion, love knows no end,\nYet how to match the thriving grass and tree?\nRaise the cups to share the heart’s intent,\nBut guard against wind and rain that mar serenity.\nAmid a thousand reds and myriad greens,\nIs there another idle soul like me?\n\n**VII**\nOld age meets spring—do not disdain its stay,\nLest spring, in stinginess, bring worldly strife.\nOf four seasons, only spring is fair,\nIn all the year, scarce ten days free from care.\nNo need to beg the moon for wine’s delight,\nBut spare the flowers from rain’s cruel blight.\nYet when a thousand petals drift away,\nHow much gold could buy such joy as this?\n\n**VIII**\nOld age meets spring—do not tire of its return,\nFor how many springs remain to see?\nPress the winecup, urge the guest to stay,\nLest laughing branches mock my folly.\nThe world’s ways cannot bear the new or old,\nThings’ truths are hard to tell from falsehood’s guise.\nWho says the phoenix and simurgh speak too much?\nThis grievance runs too deep for words to rise.\n\n**IX**\nOld age meets spring—my zest is not yet spent,\nI beg kind Spring to linger, to relent.\nIf good deeds fear the flowers’ fading hue,\nThen with deep feeling, hold the candle high and roam.\nIn wine, the merit of a warhorse’s idle sweat,\nIn verse, the crime of quiet elegance.\nThe Lord of Spring cannot endure our jest—\nHe scolds the branches, never ceasing spite.\n\n**X**\nOld age meets spring—do not regret the wild,\nFor wildness checked, the spirit’s fire grows mild.\nThe garden, just when beauty turns too bright,\nIs struck by wind and rain, by idle spite.\nFlowers half-open—hasten to admire,\nWine just ripe—taste it first, take no delay.\nMost fine things Heaven guards with jealous care,\nNot by our whim are they bestowed this way.\n\n**XI**\nOld age meets spring—spring cannot bear my weight,\nThis burden comes from age’s slow advance.\nOne body’s decline—what is there to regret?\nBut spring’s departure fills the eyes with want.\nWhen the red sun sinks, the wind grows fierce,\nWhere fallen blooms drift, the waters run deep.\nThe wandering oriole does not grasp spring’s end,\nStill from the branches it sings its sweet refrain.\n\n**XII**\nOld age meets spring—I see through spring at last,\nNo need to grieve, no need to mourn its past.\nBody and heart have their own place of rest,\nHow can mere grass and trees beguile the wise?\nToday’s glory is tomorrow’s withered state,\nThis year’s freshness was last year’s new.\nIn this world, joy and sorrow ever chase—\nHow much wine could ever calm your mind?\n\n**XIII**\nTo Minister Sima Junshi of Chongde, Long Awaited but Not Arrived\n\nYour household swallows from the rafters last year,\nThis year past the festival, they’ve not returned.\nI beg forgiveness for delaying you so long—\nYour carriage comes at last through flowers deep.\n\nHeaven bestowed on you eight measures of talent,\nA rustic must turn back midway to meet.\nOne word from the immortal I cannot forget—\nBeyond the flowers, your carriage still unseen.\n\n**Two Parting Quatrains**\n\nBeyond the tower, flowers block the narrow way,\nHard to forget your virtue, my longing stays.\nI’d ask the peach and plum to offer thanks,\nBut peach and plum are mute—what can they say?\n\nOn the high pavilion, admiring flowers,\nI bear the guilt of breaking my word.\nIf verse could ransom fault,\nWhat time could I not keep you company?\n\n**Ascending the Stone Pavilion on a Spring Day**\n\nThroughout Luoyang, the homes of ministers and lords,\nThey plant peach and plum as livelihood.\nEach year in the second month, from on high,\nNo homes are seen—only the flowers abound.\n\n**At Sixty-Three**\n\nNow sixty-three years old,\nTeeth and hair may fade, but not my will.\nAshamed to waste my spirit in vain play,\nHow could I squander talent on reckless display?\nDread the sound of scraping bone,\nWeary of schemes that test the blade’s keen edge.\nThe sage’s words I hold in reverence:\n“To fall is simply to gain advantage.”\n*(Master Chen Xiyi once spoke these words.)*\n\n**On Reflecting on Affairs**\n\nThe ancients we do not see,\nYet we may observe their hearts.\nTheir hearts held nothing else,\nBut deep regard for righteousness.\nThe people of today we do not see in heart,\nOnly in face may we perceive.\nTheir faces hold nothing else,\nBut shallow regard for gain.\nTo regard righteousness is to benefit others,\nTo regard gain is to harm the people.\nBenefiting others or harming the people,\nIn the end, it turns back on oneself.\nIf by luck one escapes,\nThe calamity still falls upon descendants.\n\n**Occasional Writing**\n\nHeaven births the myriad things,\nEach fulfilling its own way.\nOnly humans are most wise,\nAble to encompass all.\n\n**On Noble and Base Natures**\n\nOrchids and irises, fragrant and pure;\nUnicorns and phoenixes, rare and divine.\nSuch are the people—\nFew who are not virtuous.\nWolfsbane and wild aconite, venomous and foul;\nOwls, turtledoves, and vipers, cruel and dire.\nSuch are the people—\nFew who are not corrupt.\nVirtue seeks only peace,\nCorruption seeks only ruin.\nDay and night without cease,\nThey take their turns before us.\nHeaven covers all without partiality,\nEarth bears all without favor.\nOnly when both can nurture,\nDo we know their boundless grace.\n\n**Occasional Verse**\n\nFrogs and crickets scurry through mud,\nPhoenixes soar beyond the clouds.\nThough the distance between mud and sky is vast,\nHow can they ever know one another?\n\n**Ode to the Harmonizing Decoction**\n\nTwo flavors blend within the jar,\nA single sip brings wondrous effect.\nShared in leisure, no cause for care,\nDrunk alone—yet who does so for sorrow?\nA mere touch awakens the true master’s call,\nHalf-tipsy, one roams with Fuxi’s spirit.\nAll praise the joy of drunkenness,\nBut who would cease before the cup runs dry?\n\n**Washing the Bamboo**\n\nThrough frost and autumn, pine and cypress stand,\nYet thickets grow unchecked, their shadows dense.\nAll useless branches I strip away,\nLeaving only those that reach the sky.\nLike the echo of a dragon’s song,\nOr the phoenix’s return—work complete.\nNot for their use alone,\nBut for their noble bearing, unmatched in the world.\n\n**Ode to Heaven’s Will**\n\nHeaven’s will is nothing but nature,\nBeyond nature, no heaven remains.\nWho fears the dark when no deceit is sown?\nSeek the source to sever all greed.\nBefore the labor, words may still be spoken,\nBut at the harvest—what more is there to say?\nThe sage’s work is hard to follow,\nFor the priceless pearl lies deep in the abyss.\n\n**A Playful Letter to Brother Longtu**\n\nBrother, born in the same year,\nTwenty-seven days my elder.\nNo grudge bends my brow,\nYet joy makes us clap our hands.\nOur bond deepens day by day,\nOur shared Dao and righteousness endure.\nOnly one thing is lacking—\nA scribe to inscribe in cinnabar:\nEight hundred taels of gold.\n*(You chose me to write the epitaph for your parent’s burial.)*\n\n**Raising the Cup**\n\nI raise my cup to my sons,\nNow sixty-three years old.\nThough my station is not lofty,\nMy discourse on the Dao leaves no shame.\nWorldly glory fades,\nYet the joy of the grove still tempts me.\nIf you ask what tempts me—\nIt is this: to escape the world’s suspicion.\n\n**Facing the Flowers, Seventh Year of Xining**\n\nFlower branches gleam in the winecup,\nI raise the cup to toast the blooms.\nWine runs out, but money buys more,\nWithered flowers—no medicine revives.\nLet no man drink to excess too soon,\nNor let the flowers scatter too fast.\nDrink slowly before the blossoms,\nFor how long can spring endure?\n\n**Four Ways**\n\nThe Way of Heaven waxes and wanes,\nThe Way of Earth rises and falls.\nThe Way of Man knows rise and decline,\nThe Way of Things flourishes and fades.\nRise and decline do not share the same age,\nFlourishing and fading do not share the same time.\nYet why, when men face these,\nDo they know such joy and sorrow?\n\n**Forest Retreat**\n\nA marvel hidden in the woods,\nUnknown to the vulgar crowd.\nNow a full moon’s radiant night,\nNow a branch of blossoms unfurled.\nThe wine is not yet poured,\nThe guests must not depart.\nFortunate are we few in the world,\nTo have even this much.\n\n**Spring Overcast**\n\nDay after day, spring is overcast,\nThe gloom of spring ever deepens.\nThough I have the strength to tend the flowers,\nHow could I lack the heart to love the moon?\nOnly when the moon is full can it be seen,\nOnly when the flowers bloom can they be praised.\nYet why do flowers and moon\nShow so little mercy to man’s longing?\nFair flowers are hard to gaze upon for long,\nBright moons are hard to watch for long.\nFlowers last but five or seven days,\nThe moon is full but twelve times a year.\nEven at its fullest, it wanes,\nEven in bloom, it withers.\nWind and rain are common things,\nWhy then does the human heart not rest?\n\n**Toasting the Flowers**\n\nI raise my cup to the flower branches,\nLet the flowers understand this too:\nFlowers do not bloom for ten days,\nMan has but a hundred years.\nIn this fleeting, soul-stirring moment,\nWho would think of the haze of wine?\nWithout poetry to sever the bond,\nHow could one unravel a lifetime’s confusion?\n\n**Rising Late**\n\nHalf-remembered, half-forgotten dreams upon waking,\nSeeming sorrow, yet no sorrow—only weariness.\nWrapped in robes, lying sideways, unwilling to rise,\nBeyond the curtain, fallen petals swirl in chaos.\n\n**Reflections on Affairs**\n\nThe noble and the petty stand opposed,\nWisdom above, folly below—unshaken truth.\nWolfsbane’s roots do not entwine with orchids,\nYet why do they share this heaven and earth?\n\n**Three Delusions**\n\nTo age without rest is the first delusion,\nTo be at ease yet joyless is the second,\nTo be idle yet impure is the third.\nThese three delusions destroy the self.\n\n**Four Joys**\n\nFirst joy: long life as one’s domain,\nSecond joy: a bountiful year as one’s kingdom,\nThird joy: leisure as one’s virtue,\nFourth joy: peace and health as one’s power.\n\n**What Is It Like?**\n\nStand as a true man,\nAct not as a petty one.\nAll in life is fated from the start—\nWhy waste effort in vain calculations?\n\n**Questioning Spring**\n\nSince ancient times, flowers must be paired with orioles,\nOrioles and flowers were meant to appear together.\nWhy then do the flowers fade before the orioles arrive,\nYet still bear the name of \"oriole and flower\"?\nI would ask spring, but spring does not answer,\nWhat secret love does it hold for bees and butterflies?\nThe wandering oriole refuses to bear spring’s betrayal,\nSinging a thousand cries, then ten thousand more.\n\n**From the Tower to a Friend**\n\nA guest often scorns the spring on level ground,\nYet spring cannot but be as it is.\nNone are as content in a humble lane as I,\nYet once I ascend this tower, I think of you.\nAll I see are verdant groves and clouds,\nHalf the tiled roofs veiled in blossoms, fresh and new.\nTo lean on the railing, the heart must be free—\nWho in this world is truly free to lean?\n\n**On Loss**\n\nThe more one loses, the less one gains,\nLeaving only sighs in between.\nA man’s glory or decline is but the way of things,\nFlowers bloom and fade—why chase them?\nWe meet by chance, then part again,\nNow sharing joy, now sharing sorrow.\nIf one sees through it all, nothing remains—\nWhy trouble oneself with distinctions?\n\n**Placing Flowers**\n\nFlower branches reflect in the winecup,\nWithin the winecup, fine flower branches.\nMy body has known two eras of peace,\nMy eyes have seen four dynasties at their height.\nMoreover, my limbs remain strong,\nAnd the season is at its most fragrant.\nWine holds the flowers’ crimson glow,\nHow can I bear not to drink to intoxication before them?\n\n**Ode to Leisure**\n\nTo dwell in leisure, one must dwell in Luoyang,\nFor nowhere else in the world compares.\nA land of culture, gathering the wise,\nA city of mountains and rivers, ancient imperial seat.\n\n**By Rare Blooms, Holding Fragrant Wine**\n\nBy rare blooms, I hold fragrant wine,\nOn softest grass, I move my little cart.\nOnly Yaofu fails his old friends—\nYet none of his friends fail Yaofu.\n\n---\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Academician Zhang Zijian**\n\nEight years of reunion, yet grievance remains,\nHow can parting wine be poured again?\nThough my plain speech may seem like scattered pearls,\nI know the pure and harmonious sound of jade.\nTo live in this world, one should be a man of worth,\nTo admire flowers, one must be in Luoyang.\nI know the true men of past and present—\nThe craft of creation is no easy thing.\n\n---\n\n**Responding to the Twelve Poems Presented by Editor Huan of Gongcheng**\n\nTo capture likeness in painting is no easy match,\nThough painting may depict form, it cannot grasp the heart.\nReading your ten poems three times over,\nI find it surpasses revisiting my hometown once more.\nThe old capital stirs new longing,\nThe homeland appears as of old, towering and green.\nOf fame and worldly affairs, ask not—\nOnly two streams of clear tears to wipe away.\n\n---\n\n**Ode to the Joy of Things**\n\nSun, moon, and stars—heaven’s light,\nEars, eyes, mouth, nose—man’s spirit.\nKings, emperors, lords, and hegemons arise from sound,\nHeaven’s intent is not far from human feeling.\nBirds, beasts, grasses, trees—each kind differs,\nScholars, farmers, artisans, merchants—each rank forms.\nHow to ensure years of plenty and lasting peace,\nThat joy may be shared with all things in their glory?\n\n---\n\n**Ode to Welcoming Spring**\n\nSpring arrives, and I seek it through poetry,\nSpring departs, and I pursue it with wine.\nWine is drunk for spring’s coming and going,\nPoems are written for flowers’ blooming and fading.\nFlowers bloom and fade, poems are written again and again,\nSpring comes and goes, wine is poured repeatedly.\nMy feelings run deep, not for the young in years—\nHow can one bear the surging harmony within?\n\n---\n\n**Ode to Late Spring**\n\nSentimental Pan Yu envies the willow catkins,\nDrifting in and out of a thousand, ten thousand homes.\nYouthful vigor and ambition are all lost,\nOld age knows nothing of new affairs.\nMy poems may have faults, but others forgive,\nWhile my wine’s merits I alone proclaim.\nYet one lingering sorrow remains—\nMost of my old friends are now beyond the horizon.\n\n---\n\n**Two Poems Matching Rhymes with Minister Wang Zhongmei on His Retirement**\n\n**I**\nSeventy years in this world awaited,\nLike Master Zhang, I compose my return to the fields.\nTo know the times and act accordingly is wisdom indeed,\nWho would say nurturing one’s will is not right?\nMoreover, there is joy in forests and streams,\nNo longer bound by official duties.\nRecently, I drove my little cart to call,\nOnly to find you napping on a spring afternoon.\n\n**II**\nSince ancient times, talent soars when inspired,\nWhy does my lord alone know the times?\nA lifetime of aspirations never bent,\nIn this flourishing age, hanging up your cap is fitting.\nWillows sway gently in the breeze,\nFlowers, pressed by spring, smile as the sun lingers.\nThe clamor of attendants shakes the earth as they pass,\nYet no one asks who it is.\n\n---\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Attendant Wang of Beijing on His Visit and Gift of Poems**\n\nYour carriage came from Beijing to admire spring,\nGeng Jun’s heart had already raced ahead.\nNow frost falls heavily—what can be done?\nThis year’s flowers bloom in vain, all sound.\nYou honor me with fine verses and a visiting card,\nSurely there are no clumsy lines to convey my name.\nHeaven’s talent and beauty should be cherished—\nI know you were not born in vain for this age.\n\n---\n\n**Ode to Joy**\n\nFive joys in this life,\nFive delights in dwelling in Luoyang.\nMost take them lightly as commonplace,\nYet I hold them as no small matter.\nMy talent is unremarkable,\nMy knowledge leaves no record.\nBut my heart is at peace—\nHow could I ever exhaust these?\n\n**The Five Joys:**\nFirst, to be born in the Central Kingdom,\nSecond, to be born a man,\nThird, to be born a scholar,\nFourth, to witness an era of great peace,\nFifth, to hear of the Dao and righteousness.\n\n**The Five Delights:**\nFirst, many good people,\nSecond, many fine deeds,\nThird, many beautiful things,\nFourth, many lovely scenes,\nFifth, many grand principles.\n\n---\n\n**Ode to Joyousness**\n\nJoyous, ever joyous,\nJoy and delight, ever more joy.\nNoble men are my friends,\nFine scenes are mine to behold.\nFine wine is mine to drink,\nFine food is mine to savor.\nThis body, born and grown old,\nLives entirely in an age of peace.\n\n---\n\n**Ode to the Heavenly Dao**\n\nThe Heavenly Dao is not hard to know,\nHuman nature is not easy to fathom.\nThough one hears words,\nOne must also observe deeds.\nLeaning on the desk—great effort,\nWielding the halberd—base endeavor.\nThe *Spring and Autumn* relies on seizing the moment,\nA little cart is all one needs.\n\n---\n\n**Ode to a Single Chamber**\n\nA single chamber can hold a life,\nAll four seasons bring eternal spring.\nNever lacking fine wine,\nNever without worthy guests.\nWithin the grotto, the flower admirer is Junshi—\nHis dwelling has a grotto.\nAt the edge of the sky, the moon-floating man is Junzhi—\nHis dwelling has a tower.\nWhen we meet, there should be words,\nLaughing at my excessive caution.\n\n---\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Junshi, Minister of the Eastern Capital, on His Solitary Stroll by the Luo River**\n\nCaps and carriages crowd the nine thoroughfares,\nVoices clamor and jostle for precedence.\nOnly you take none of this as a matter,\nAt last, I believe there are true men in this world.\nThe wind turns, the river’s voice grows faint,\nThe setting sun, pale, is veiled by clouds.\nA pair of white egrets appears beyond the mist,\nAbout to land on the sand, they take flight again.\n\n---\n\n**A Solitary Stroll by Tianjin Bridge After Rain**\n\nLuoyang’s palaces are veiled in clear mist,\nSince Tang and Han, their histories are recorded.\nHow many rises and falls have vanished—\nOnly the old mountains and rivers remain on all sides.\n\n---\n\n**Spring’s Colors**\n\nLast year, spring departed and would not stay,\nThis year, where has spring’s color come from?\nLuoyang is everywhere a Peach Blossom Spring,\nMy little cart slowly turns toward East Street.\n\n---\n\n**Ode to Great Peace**\n\nIn days of great peace under heaven,\nIn times of ease for all people,\nWhen flowers bloom in profusion,\nHow can one keep from smiling?\n\n---\n\n**Four Poems Left at the Foot of Jinping Mountain During the Cold Food Festival**\n\n**I**\nThe riverbank teems with peach and plum blossoms,\nI cannot bear to see them ravaged by the wind.\nHow can I let this spring slip away?\nI linger on the heights, reluctant to leave.\n\n**II**\nCold Food Festival’s wind and mist at Jinping’s foot,\nFrom on high, I raise my cup—what joy!\nThe riverbank’s peach and plum blossoms are radiant,\nI cannot bear to see them shattered by the wind.\n\n**III**\nBoundless peach and plum blossoms await Qingming,\nOnly after a year do they fully bloom.\nDo they not recall the Creator’s labor?\nWhy does the wild wind cruelly torment them?\n\n**IV**\nHalf of spring’s flowers bloom in a hundred thousand ways,\nLately, the east wind has cruelly ravaged them.\nPitiful are the peach and plum, so gentle in nature—\nBlown away, they utter not a word.\n\n---\n\n**Two Years of Visits to Jinping Mountain, Unable to Meet Magistrate Zheng—Sent to Him in Verse**\n\n**Year after year, the myriad blossoms bloom in splendor,**\nBeneath Jinping Mountain, spring’s rewards arrive.\nTwo years now, I’ve failed to follow your immortal footsteps—\nHas the cave’s transcendent one not yet returned?\n\n---\n\n**Before the Eastern Pavilion, a single peony blooms in unmatched glory,**\nTwenty-four branches, each a beauty knitting her brows.\nOf all the world’s spring, Luoyang claims ten parts—\nYet the Shao family alone holds seven or eight.\n\n**A single peony blooms in wondrous rarity,**\nTwenty-four branches encircled by graceful maidens.\nNone in Luoyang City know this marvel—\nThe Shao family alone claims the season’s finest hour.\n\n---\n\n**Flower Season Hindered by Rain, Unable to Go Out**\n\nIn Luoyang, spring reaches its midpoint in the third month,\nSwing ropes still hang, catkins drift on the breeze.\nMy small carriage stays idle in the mud of spring,\nAmid scattered petals, orioles sing in flight.\n\n---\n\n**Chanting in the Abode of Peace**\n\nIn the Abode of Peace, duties are fulfilled as they ought—\nBeyond this, what more could one seek?\nI welcome all scholars under heaven,\nAnd wander every garden in Luoyang.\n\nWhat I must do, I do with utmost sincerity;\nIn observing others, I never strain to see their efforts.\nYet recalling those carefree springtime words—\nThey lift me to a hundred-foot tower.\n\n**Sima Junshi once wrote:**\n*“Only now do I know—*\n*On level ground,*\n*One cannot exhaust the sight of youthful spring.”*\n\nIn the Abode of Peace, nothing stirs—\nSave a single scroll of Fuxi’s writings.\nWhen weary, I rest my head, no need for sleep;\nAfter meals, I take my staff and wander where I will.\n\nI prepare to steep tea with dew-gathered water,\nAnd guard against mixing herbs to cultivate perch.\nWere it not for the sages who dispelled my ignorance,\nI might have become a shallow man of this world.\n\nIn the Abode of Peace, I pore over old texts,\nOld texts that record and link anew.\nThree thousand days beneath lamp and candlelight,\nTwenty years among waters and flowers.\n\nMountains and rivers have their masters, hard to claim;\nYet the wind and moon, free for all, I seize at will.\nLet none ask of my idle chanting—\nThis art is not passed down in the world.\n\nIn the Abode of Peace, I am a lord of ten thousand households,\nHow could I bear to waste these fine days and fair scenes?\nI’ve already grasped spring in its fullness—\nNow, in old age, I would let my heart roam free.\n\nWhen morning dew is heavy, flowers fill the balustrade;\nWhen warm wine floats, cups brim with drink.\nThe Sage’s affairs are but trifles—\nThey spare both effort and worry.\n\nIn the Abode of Peace, spring dreams fade,\nNo worldly dust to clutter the heart.\nA light breeze brushes past my seat;\nFaint music drifts from beyond the heavens.\n\nAs the sun shifts, I lean on my staff and sandals;\nWhere flower shadows mingle, I linger by the wine jar.\nNowhere in the world compares to my homeland—\nAnd how much finer, for my homeland teems with talent.\n\nIn the Abode of Peace, spring does not wane,\nThe mountain elder comes and goes in his small carriage.\nBy the water’s edge, green willows line the shore;\nBeyond the flowers, fragrant grass carpets the dyke.\n\nBright-eyed, I watch the scenes of the third month;\nVigorous, I’ve lived through four reigns.\nBy the Phoenix Tower, near the Heavenly Ford,\nI face the wind, tipsy, and return home.\n\nIn the Abode of Peace, the third month draws near,\nOnly in old age do I learn to cherish fragrant blossoms.\nI know this one delight is mine to claim—\nWho would leave even a single gold coin unspent?\n\nFine wine I drink until slightly drunk;\nFair flowers I admire at half their bloom.\nSuch feelings defy description—\nI fear no one in the world understands.\n\nIn the Abode of Peace, as spring wanes,\nI shut my door, too indolent to sit, few guests come.\nA gentle rain clears between the bamboo;\nEmerald birds flit above the flowers.\n\nI record the finest scenes in verse,\nAnd sustain joy with wine.\nBeyond this, all else in life—\nI turn my head and feign ignorance.\n\nIn the Abode of Peace, I am far from poor,\nFor within, there is a couch to hold me.\nConfucian winds transformed, reaching the Dao,\nHarmony fills the four seasons, ever like spring.\n\nSun and moon shine bright, the sovereign’s light;\nWords become trust, trust arises from men.\nOnly man and the sun stand close—\nBeyond this, what truth remains?\n\nIn the Abode of Peace, though unsettled,\nA brief course of medicine restores me.\nIn ordinary times, free of illness, I take no herbs—\nEven in misfortune, I await heaven’s will.\n\nWhen reason dims, I must seek discourse;\nWhen emotions reach their end, what more is there to say?\nAll other vain and idle thoughts—\nI may as well exchange them for a day’s sleep.\n\nIn the Abode of Peace, spring is about to depart,\nThough loath to compose a poem to send it off.\nThough spring ages and is hard to reclaim,\nEarly summer soon arrives to take its place.\n\nDrink wine, but do not let it lead to drunkenness;\nAdmire flowers, but take care not to let them scatter.\nIf one understands such things,\nHow could idle sorrows ever furrow the brow?\n\n**He also wrote:**\nIn the Abode of Peace, the third month draws near,\nOnly in old age do I learn to cherish fragrant blossoms.\nBeware drunkenness, lest it breed illness;\nFear the scattering of flowers, for they will soon take flight.\n\nDrink wine, but do not let it lead to drunkenness;\nAdmire flowers, but take care not to let them scatter.\nScattered flowers and drunkenness—bitter tastes,\nBringing not joy, but sorrow.\n\nBorn a man in an auspicious time,\nIn the Abode of Peace, a life of ease and wealth.\nWith grand strokes, I write poems boasting of vigor;\nWith a small cup, I savor light, pure wine.\n\nMountains and rivers, clear after rain;\nGrasses and trees, radiant in spring’s embrace.\nThe Creator’s craftsmanship, so exquisite—\nAll should be entrusted to the carefree.\n\nIn the Abode of Peace, though unbound,\nUnbound, I never stray from the Confucian path.\nLight wine I sip from a small cup;\nBold poems I write in large characters.\n\nFlowers and trees, radiant after spring rain;\nMountains and rivers, clear in late autumn’s wake.\nHow vast the meaning in idleness—\nUnashamed to be a true man in this world.\n\n---\n\n**On Eating Pears**\n\nI urge you, do not favor the golden-flowered pear,\nBut rather, love the red-fading pear.\nThough both share a hue like rouge,\nTheir tastes differ greatly.\n\nThe red-fading pear is sweet as maltose;\nThe golden-flowered pear makes you frown.\nSuch deceptions abound—\nBefore eating, you must discern them well.\n\n---\n\n**Matching Rhymes in Reply to Vice Director Wang Anzhi**\n\nPeaks rise like screens on all sides,\nHow can I bear to see them piled with drifting clouds?\nWe’ve already shared countless flower-viewings—\nLet us now arrange a few mountain excursions.\n\nThough not yet old, autumn’s light inspires my brush;\nAt the first chill, wine fills my cup.\nA light breeze is already delightful—\nHow much finer, if it comes from the depths of water lilies and lotuses.\n\n**End of Volume Ten of *Yichuan’s Songs from the Beaten Earth* / Beginning of Volume Eleven of *Yichuan’s Songs from the Beaten Earth* / By Shao Yong of Yichuan, styled Yaofu**\n\n---\n\n**Viewing Flowers on the Third Day of the Third Month, Thinking of Friends**\n\nOn the third day, viewing flowers—how lush their intent!\nThis year, just as it was in years past.\nWhere now are those who once shared the sight?\nRaising my cup, I still face the distant wind.\n\n---\n\n**Teasing Prefect Wu**\n\nIn recent years, men slight fine flowers,\nUnknowing how the Lord of Spring resents their scorn.\nHe bids their price rise a hundredfold—\nAnd buys back all the spring of Luoyang.\n\nOne plant bears twenty-four branches,\nEach branch a beauty to overthrow a city.\nYet fearing the wild wind’s chill bite,\nHe has them all inscribed in verse at their prime.\n\nAt my home grows one peony, named \"Hue-Enhancing Red,\"\nWhich blooms in twenty-four branches.\n\n---\n\n**Oriole’s Song**\n\nTo rise to the high bough was ever its fate,\nThough it left the valley not long ago.\nIts tongue is but tender bamboo,\nIts robe newly woven of gold.\n\nFor the flowers, it speaks of their brilliance;\nFor the willows, it tells of their grace.\nAt dusk beyond the willows, it still trills;\nAt dawn before the flowers, it sings again.\n\nIts song swells when rain has passed;\nIts trills fade as spring departs.\nLet no traveler hear it—\nThe traveler’s path is already lost.\n\n---\n\n**On Appreciating Flowers**\n\nThose who do not truly appreciate flowers\nLove only their outward form.\nThose who do appreciate them\nLove only their inner wonder.\n\nThe form lies in their hues,\nHues men may imitate.\nThe wonder lies in their spirit,\nA spirit no man can create.\n\n---\n\n**On Drinking Wine**\n\nThose who do not drink well\nDelight only in drinking much.\nThose who do drink well\nDelight only in drinking harmoniously.\n\nTo drink much is to grow sodden;\nSodden, the body falls ill.\nTo drink harmoniously is to grow mellow;\nMellow, the face glows bright.\n\n---\n\n**On Fewer Concerns**\n\nFewer cares, fewer dreams;\nFewer words, fewer faults.\nThe curtain hangs—one knows the day is long;\nThe willows stand still—one feels the breeze is light.\n\nOne sees only flowers bloom and fade,\nHears no gossip of right or wrong.\nWhy seek a grotto abode?\nThe years will pass slowly enough.\n\n---\n\n**A Spring’s Span**\n\nA spring holds ninety days—\nHalf are lost to wind and rain.\nThe flowers are fair, yet no one sees;\nThe heart runs wild, yet cannot be restrained.\n\n---\n\n**The World’s Song**\n\nThe world is ever in tumult—\nWho in it is free of cares?\nHow fortunate am I alone,\nReclining to watch Luoyang’s spring!\n\n---\n\n**Spring Waters**\n\nSpring waters run clear into waves,\nYet waves can do nothing.\nThey cannot dye other things,\nOnly the lightest silks.\n\n---\n\n**Spring Rain**\n\nSpring rain, fine as silk threads,\nDrizzling down in gentle drops.\nHow can one downpour\nMake all things flourish so?\n\n---\n\n**What a Pity**\n\nWhat a pity—this flourishing spring,\nGone in a moment, never to be found again.\nBefore my eyes, gardens stretch without end,\nYet all I see are orioles singing, no men in sight.\n\n---\n\n**Pinning Flowers**\n\nPinning flowers, I feign youth;\nPouring wine, I pretend carelessness.\nThe flowers are fair, the wine is fine, the mood finer still—\nYet tomorrow, my illness will only deepen.\n\n---\n\n**Spring Departs**\n\nAs spring departs, do not lament its lateness;\nSummer arrives—rejoice in its newness.\nThough lingering fragrance remains,\nIt cannot compare to the shade of green.\n\n---\n\n**Matching Rhymes in Farewell to Prefect Li Junxi, Drafter of the Dragon Diagram**\n\nThe affectionate Prefect bids spring farewell,\nJust as the flowers burst into fullest bloom.\nSince ancient times, heroes have prized gratitude—\nFair blossoms, do not scatter too soon.\n\n---\n\n**Three Poems in Reply to Li Xi Chun, Agricultural Commissioner**\n\nLast year, you sent me poems from afar—\nEven then, I sighed at how few friends remained.\nNow, barely half of those survive—\nHow long can we delay our joyful gatherings?\n\nBy bamboo groves and water’s edge, the heart feels light;\nBeneath the moon, before the wind, the mood is rich.\nIn Luoyang’s gatherings, days without cares—\nIf not for our few, who else remains?\n\nThe sun and moon in my breast now brighten, now darken;\nWind and clouds beneath my brush now gather, now part.\nThough old and without achievement, I am thus—\nWhat would I do if I ever succeeded?\n\n---\n\n**On Encountering Spring in Old Age**\n\nIn old age, meeting spring—do not doubt it:\n*Commentary: When the patterns of things unfold, when human feelings are laid bare.*\nThough no form is visible,\nOnly the heart can know.\n\nIn old age, one learns to cherish the fragrant and fair.\n*Commentary: The prime of the year, the height of the three spring months.*\nThe flowers are worthy of love—\nHow much more so the finest blooms?\n\nI know this one moment of delight is fated.\n*Commentary: When all plants vie in beauty, when rare flowers stand apart.*\nThe Lord of Spring’s deep intent\nIs also to be known by men.\n\nWho would let a thousand gold pieces go to waste?\n*Commentary: When the sun hastens, when gold nears its end.*\nExtravagant hearts spend all,\nOnly then do brows unfurrow.\n\nLet fine wine be drunk to mild intoxication,\n*Commentary: When the jar’s head foams, when the cup’s surface blooms.*\nWhen guests come to call—\nEven in winter, it is called \"the time of Fuxi.\"\n\nLet the fair flowers open halfway,\n*Commentary: When the wind is light, as if smiling; when the dew is heavy, as if weeping.*\nOnly at the point of smile and tear\nDoes their rich fragrance cling to one’s robes.\n\nSuch meaning is hard to name—\n*Commentary: When yin and yang first stir, when heaven and earth are not yet divided.*\nWords cannot reach it,\nNor brush and ink depict it.\n\nI fear no one in the world understands.\n*Commentary: When wine reaches mellow drunkenness, when flowers are in fullest bloom.*\nMellow drunkenness leads to sodden stupor;\nFullest bloom leads to scattering petals.\n\n---\n\n**Matching Rhymes to Minister Xie Yanguo’s \"Returning Drunk in Wind and Rain at Night’s Depth\"**\n\nIn the Hall of the Dao, idle talk fills the hours,\nYet

Rhymes to Minister Xie Junshi’s \"Only Flowers and Plants Mark Winter and Spring\"**\n\nAt times, I ask myself—\nAm I not a man from before Fuxi’s time?\nThe days pass, the months come, yet I do not

shimmers the towers.\nBetter to chant your poems,\nAnd the cool breeze will rise of itself.\n\n**Chanting in Large Script**\nPoems composed, half-drunk and mellow,\nTranscribed with a brush broad as a rafter.\nWhen the heart is full, let the hand roam free;\nWhen the spirit congeals, dip the tip once more.\nLu Yang’s sun-reversing feat was but slight,\nZong Que’s wind-riding ambition still fell short.\nTo write of peace too vast for words—\nLet the world sing its praises as it will.\n\n**Teaching My Son**\nTo master oneself is rare among thousands.\nThough one knows, speak as if one does not;\nThe difference lies in action, not inaction.\nOnly the comprehensive is called talent’s bloom,\nOnly the outstanding, a treasure at the feast.\nHow far apart are good and evil—\nSome by nature, some by diligence.\n\n**Arm Pain**\nFirst the head-wind afflicted this ailing frame,\nNow arm pain—what more can come?\nNo hindrance to the cup, only to bowing;\nThough hair goes unkempt, books remain unneglected.\nNo need to seek cures in medicine—\nLaughter and talk will dispel it all.\nAll things age and fall ill;\nWhy should man alone escape?\n\n**The World’s Ways**\nOnly by stealing leisure does one find it—\nI was born into an unhurried life.\nTime is finite, all return to age,\nBut boundless wind and moon console the face.\nBeyond my seat, only water and bamboo;\nAscending heights, only clouds and mountains.\nDrunk, I sleep beneath the blossoms—\nOnly when the blossoms fade does the dream end.\n\n**Rhapsody on Untrammeled Writing**\nWho says the phoenix nests on Cinnabar Peak?\nBeneath my brush, its nine plumes appear.\nA single line, when apt, transforms like a tiger;\nA grand composition, as if by divine communion.\nA thousand patterns, like Sichuan brocade in new designs,\nTen thousand trees, their branches warmed by spring.\nThe heavenly steed leaves no trace across the eight poles—\nOnly the wind and moon, struck like chimes.\n\n**Two Poems on the Whirlwind**\n\n**I**\nHow can there be peace if men are not at peace?\nWhere hearts are level, strife cannot arise.\nI shun the schemes of chess,\nBut delight in the words of the lute.\nIn youth, my heart clung to imperial canons;\nIn age, my thoughts rest on sacrificial rites.\nI know where true achievement lies—\nPines and cassia show their green in deepest winter.\n\n**II**\nPines and cassia show their green in deepest winter,\nWhile mugwort and reeds flourish in summer’s height.\nOnce time has passed, the rope cannot strike;\nBefore gain and loss, men must contend.\nIn doubt, move not;\nIn fortune, walk always.\nMen’s hearts are not so far apart—\nHow can there be peace if men are not at peace?\n\n**Two More Poems**\n\n**I**\nLately, illness has assailed this failing frame—\nWhy seek no medicine?\nBefore the pavilion, dense leaves form a canopy;\nBeneath the steps, yellow blossoms scatter like gold.\nWatching bees gather honey,\nObserving swallows build their nests—\nNot that the world lacks kindred spirits,\nBut that Yaofu plays the lute poorly.\n\n**II**\nYaofu plays the lute poorly,\nNot that the world lacks kindred spirits.\nOld age cannot do what youth does;\nYouth does not know the heart of age.\nTo nurture the spirit, sit in stillness;\nTo harmonize the mind, delight in pure chant.\nWhy seek no medicine?\nLately, illness has assailed this failing frame.\n\n**Head-Wind**\nLately, the head-wind is unbearable—\nYet talk and laughter, song remain unchecked.\nMen’s talents differ little,\nBut how much do matters truly contend?\nEyes closed, all before me is darkness;\nHeart open, beyond the heavens—nothing else.\nIf all were won by cunning and calculation,\nMany a hero would excel at scheming.\n\n**Answering a Guest**\nSpeakers always overstate—\nThe Way must be rolled up, then unfurled.\nGood things in the world are not constant;\nWhere in the world are there no extraordinary talents?\nNearing old age, I roam freely with my staff;\nWhen poems please me, I take up the brush.\nYet even joy may feel constrained—\nSo I write wild verses in bold script.\n\n**Growing Old**\nOld, without achievement, out of step with the times,\nIn middle age, nursing illness, I only chant poems.\nFollowing my thoughts, I seek release—\nHow could I stir trouble with words?\nThe world’s idle sorrows are all the same;\nWhat more can one do in this life?\nLeaning on my staff, I walk at dusk by the Tianjin Bridge—\nI tell the gulls: beware, do not fly.\n\nAt sixty-three, twenty-five years in Luoyang.\nIn the quiet woods, the city yields mountain views;\nBy the level pond, my seat overlooks river lands.\nAdmiring blossoms, I am ever vexed by cups and plates;\nLoving the moon, I am often wounded by wind and dew.\nSeeing the boundless goodness of peace—\nWhat matter if this body grows old?\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Wang Anzhi, Judicial Commissioner**\n\nOne good deed is already excellence—\nHow can it match your hundredfold cultivation?\nLong ago, your kind mother’s love detained you;\nFor years, the official path held no allure.\nYour talent ranks low, but your virtue stands alone;\nYour post differs, yet the academy honors your white hair.\nToo long has the Luoyang circle kept us apart—\nSo much joy, now to be set aside.\n\n**Understanding Things**\nOne who understands things is called perceptive;\nOne who knows the times is called wise.\nWisdom, misapplied, becomes harm;\nPerception, overdone, loses its purity.\n\n**Few Joys**\nWhy strive for fame or profit?\nWhy, sir, do you have so few joys?\nTo value oneself by the Way is right—\nTo be entangled in the unreasonable is meaningless.\nThe tale of ascending to heaven by daylight may be false,\nBut who has ever been drunk exchanging gold marten for wine?\nWho says cares weigh more than mountains?\nThey are but commonplace in this world.\n\n**Rising from Illness**\nIllness began a month ago through procrastination—\nWho knew it would linger so painfully?\nMorning and evening, food is hard to take;\nThis frail body defies description.\nYet I urge guests to raise their cups,\nAnd take up my brush to write poems.\nOnly then do I know the heart commands the qi—\nWhen the heart is glad, even deep illness dissolves.\n\n**Half-Drunk**\nHalf-drunk, I mount the carriage,\nThe carriage rolls smoothly home.\nA light breeze greets my face,\nGreen willows brush my head.\n\nIf the mind embraces three affairs,\nAnd the heart commands nine banners—\nSuch idle wealth and honor,\nI wager none could fathom.\n\n**Half-Drunk in a Small Carriage**\nHalf-drunk, I ride in a small carriage,\nA glory unmatched in this world.\nA gentle breeze brushes my face,\nWeeping willows lightly graze my head.\n\nIf the mind embraces three affairs,\nAnd the heart commands ten thousand troops—\nSuch idle wealth and honor,\nI wager none would contest.\n\n**Gazing in the Mirror**\nAt dawn, I gaze in the mirror and see a hoary head,\nDelighted to find myself suddenly an immortal old man.\nBoldly, I dare to speak for all under heaven,\nClearly voicing the lofty Dao of this world.\nThough the world itself is fundamentally without trouble,\nStill, the world ever abounds with worthies.\nI ask myself: what use is this body?\nThis body is fit only for old forests and springs.\n\n**On Human Malice**\nA human life spans a hundred years,\nYet how many hardships lie within?\nNow at sixty-three,\nI have passed more than half.\nThough my bones grow gaunt, it is no sign of purity;\nThough my hair turns white, it is no measure of years.\nEven if I were to transform now, it would not be untimely—\nHow much more so when I remain roughly hale and hearty.\n\n**On Old Age**\nMy body ages in an era of peace,\nMy body is idle, my heart even more so.\nNeither noble nor base,\nNeither hungry nor cold.\nWhen guests arrive, I must pour wine;\nNo day passes without a smile.\nThe first and smoothest path—\nWho will accompany me on my way?\n\n**On the Ancient Zither**\nLong have I kept books and chess by my side,\nAnd though poor, I have long treasured this too.\nIts pegs carved from green jade,\nIts markers inlaid with gold.\nOften pawned to entertain guests,\nRarely played to seek understanding.\nLately, my servants are wicked—\nI must guard against the day they boil the crane.\n\n**Seeking Trust**\nAt first, I sought others’ trust,\nSome knew, some did not.\nThen I sought to trust myself,\nAnd many came to know me.\nNow I seek no trust at all—\nWho would still raise doubts?\nWith nothing that must be, nothing that must not,\nWherever I go, all is harmony.\n\n**On Scorpions and Snakes**\nSnake venom strikes from afar,\nScorpion venom brings death near.\nThough snake and scorpion differ,\nTheir venom is no different.\nThe snake strikes with its head,\nThe scorpion wields its tail.\nAlas, in this world between heaven and earth,\nOne fears both head and tail.\n\n**On Freedom**\nThe heart is but an inch wide,\nYet why do the two hands cling so?\nThe body spans but a few feet,\nYet why do the two feet tread so narrowly?\nWho does not drink wine?\nWho does not read books?\nAlas, in this world between heaven and earth,\nOnly Yaofu is truly free.\n\n**On Peace of Mind**\nWhen the heart is at peace, the body is at ease;\nWhen the body is at ease, the room feels spacious.\nWhen both heart and body are at peace,\nWhat matter can disturb them?\nWho says the body is small?\nIts peace is like Mount Tai.\nWho says the room is small?\nIts spaciousness is like heaven and earth.\n\n**On Poetry**\nWhy is it called poetry?\nPoetry is the expression of one’s aspirations.\nOnce words form a composition,\nThey convey the matters of the heart.\nNot only must the words be refined,\nBut the intent must be refined as well.\nRefining words yields marvelous lines;\nRefining intent yields lingering flavor.\n\n**On Doing Good**\nWhen one does good deeds,\nGood deeds are right to perform.\nEven metal and stone can be moved—\nHow could one deceive ghosts and spirits?\nAct in accord with fate and virtue,\nSpeak from the depths of the liver and spleen.\nAsk not of what lies beyond the self—\nWhether others know or not.\n\n**On the Moment**\nWhen trouble comes again and again,\nHow can one act with true spontaneity?\nEmbrace the new with resolve,\nFollow the good without delay.\nEven thieves have their own Dao,\nYet some men lack humaneness.\nVirtue has no fixed form—\nWhere one dwells in peace, there lies the path.\n\n**Chance Reflections**\nThe sun is the essence of all images,\nMan is the spirit of all things.\nAll images and all things\nAre born of heaven.\nWords gain trust through man,\nThe moon shines by the sun.\nThrough man and through the sun,\nHow could there not be great peace?\n\n**On Sitting in Stillness**\nLife is fated from birth,\nAll things are fixed from their origin.\nWho says man is the most spiritually endowed,\nYet falls short of things’ true nature?\nSome say yin harbors ghosts,\nWhich can bring a man to death.\nIf death has its cause,\nWhat is there to seek beyond it?\nMoreover, man’s fate\nIs struck by heaven, not by others.\nIf yin ghosts possess power,\nWhat can they do against heaven alone?\n\n**On the Joy of Stillness**\nHarmonious qi is even through the four seasons—\nWhat time is not spring?\nTransforming the joy of nothingness\nInto a tangible form.\nQuietly appraising things in poetry,\nLeisurely expounding principles to the heart—\nThough there be no drums or pipes,\nThis joy is unmatched in the world.\n\n**On Being a True Man**\nTo be a true man,\nOne must complete four tasks.\n\n**On Wealth, Beauty, Fame, and Power**\nWealth can make men greedy,\nBeauty can make men lustful,\nFame can make men arrogant,\nPower can make men reliant.\nOnce these four perils are wholly cast aside,\nWhat need remains in the dust of the world?\n\n**Longing for Rain**\nIn the height of summer, rain has long withheld,\nAnd all beneath heaven are steeped in sorrow.\nHow might a single cloud arise\nTo bring salvation to the human realm?\nThough long drought at last yields rain,\nAnd joy briefly soothes the ache of want—\nIt may settle the dust,\nBut cannot save the withering grain.\n\n**On Weighing Righteousness**\nThe petty man, by nature, lacks discernment,\nSeeing only profit as his guide.\nThe noble man, by nature, does not deceive,\nYet when gain appears, he weighs it against righteousness.\nTo ponder righteousness is to disregard death,\nTo see profit may make one forget life.\nThese two arise from\nThe level and the uneven.\n\n**On Gold and Silk**\nGold and silk are but one kind of thing,\nYet their use is never constant.\nAs gifts, they are called \"offerings\";\nAs ashes, they are called \"remnants\";\nIn trade, they are called \"goods\";\nIn hoarding, they are called \"treasure\";\nAs bribes, they are called \"graft\";\nIn theft, they are called \"plunder.\"\n\n**The Bandit Lord’s Lament**\nThe Bandit Lord eyes wealth and goods,\nHis mind fixed on nothing else.\nWhen taking, he fears it is too little;\nWhen caught, he regrets it is too much.\nThe Bandit Lord eyes wealth and goods,\nHis mind set only on accumulation.\nIf only his greed when taking\nWere like his regret when caught!\n\n**On Treating Things**\nIn dealing with things, nothing surpasses sincerity—\nSincerity alone moves all under heaven.\nThe feelings of things know no distance,\nThe Dao of heaven makes itself clear.\nOne must attend to principle and righteousness,\nAnd never boast of one’s abilities.\nThe world’s idle adornments\nAre but empty names in the end.\n\n**On Yao and Shun**\nThe eyes of all under heaven serve as eyes,\nAnd are called \"illuminating the four directions.\"\nThe ears of all under heaven serve as ears,\nAnd are called \"penetrating the four quarters.\"\nIn former years, tassels and floss were bestowed,\nValued for their lack of partiality.\nTo act without acting, yet nothing is left undone—\nKnowing this, one does not live in vain.\n\n**On Airing Books**\nBookworms do little harm,\nBut men who worm through books do great harm.\nBookworms may be banished by airing,\nBut what of men who worm through books?\n\n**On Rain’s Trespass**\nSuch endeavors are hard for others to follow,\nThis skill is not passed down through the world.\nTo know heaven by peering through the window is common,\nBut to know heaven without peering—that is true knowledge.\n\n**Lamenting Drought**\nJust when rain is needed, it does not fall,\nAnd where disaster has struck, it strikes again.\nHow is it that the hundred grains near ruin,\nWhile only mugwort and weeds cover the land?\n\n**On Idleness**\nAll things under heaven are like a grindstone,\nCaught in the mechanism of withering and flourishing, gain and loss.\nThere is but one thing without counterpart—\nIt is as when heaven and earth were yet undivided.\n\n**The Gatekeeper Invites a Friend**\nA gentle breeze stirs, soft and clear,\nA small pavilion overlooks the thoroughfare.\nI do not wish to enjoy it alone for long—\nCan you come and share it with me?\n\n**Recalling a Dream**\nThough the household is poor, the heart is content,\nThough the body is coarse, the affection is deep.\nOpening one’s robe reveals gaunt bones,\nSpeaking reveals a nature unspoiled.\n\n**On Writing in Large Characters**\nA poem composed, written in bold script—\nWho else knows such exhilaration?\nWaves like silver mountains rise,\nMasts towering over a hundred feet.\nDelighting in small cups of wine,\nComposing poems in large characters—\nIn all the world of men,\nWho else knows such joy?\n\n**Rejoicing in Oneself**\nThe common folk flourish, knowing your virtue,\nThe times are harmonious, witnessing the emperor’s merit.\nI, an old man born of humble tile,\nLive out my days in this age of peace.\n\n*Yichuan Jirang Ji, Scroll Eleven Concludes*\n*Yichuan Jirang Ji, Scroll Twelve*\n\n**Dream Within a Dream**\nIn dreams, one often speaks of dreaming,\nWho knows the thoughts upon waking?\nUnknowing, is this present moment also a dream?\nThen speak again of the time within dreams.\n\n**Midday**\nMidday is for *Shi He*,¹\nExchange is the common way.\nThey know not one another,\nWhy ponder further?\n\n**Moonlight Upon the Wuyan Tree²**\nThe moon reaches the wutong tree,\nThe wind comes by the willow’s side.\nThe courtyard deep, the people still—\nWith whom to share this scene?\n\n**Walking in Moonlight**\nThrough the forest’s clefts, the sky grows ever bluer,\nAfter the wind, the moon shines brighter.\nOn days when the world knows no trouble,\nOne may wander here at will.\n\n**An Occasional Verse**\nIn this world, affairs are hard to settle,\nIn this world, matters are hard to secure.\nThere is a man whose name I know not,\nIn stillness, I see him idly wield his whisk.\n\n**In Reply to a Question**\nIdle words beneath the trees—\nWhy ask further what they mean?\nI know myself to lack all discipline,\nHow can this be called poetry?\n\n**To Li Shenyan, Dragon Diagram Scholar of Caozhou³**\nWhat once was said to be right,\nNow proves to be wrong.\nHow know that today is right,\nAnd not give rise to later doubt?\n\nWhat once was said to be me,\nNow proves to be you.\nNot knowing who I am today,\nWho will it be later on?\n\n**A Clear Night’s Verse**\nThe moon reaches the heart of heaven,\nThe wind comes to the water’s surface.\nThe same pure flavor—\nFew, I think, truly know it.\n\n**Thinking of the Sage**\nNever meeting the Sage in his time,\nNever seeing the Sage’s face.\nYet the Sage’s words may be heard,\nThe Sage’s heart may be seen.\n\n**The Noble Man**\nThe noble man upholds the great essence,\nThe petty man lacks constancy.\nHe seeks no perfection in others,\nAnd fears only to receive too much kindness.\n\n**Contentment**\nContent with one’s lot, the body knows no shame,\nAware of the subtle, the heart is at ease.\nThough dwelling in the world of men,\nOne is as if beyond it.\n\n**Reflections on Affairs**\nThe four seas, the three rivers, the five lakes—\nAll are linked by boats, not by carts.\nCountless travelers pass in peace—\nCan this all be due to a single censer’s incense?\n\n**Ascending the Stone Pavilion**\nA single sentiment, hard to restrain,\nI have long feared climbing high to gaze afar.\nToday, leaning on the railing, unlike other days,\nHow many times have I nearly descended—yet linger still.\n\n**Recalling the Past**\nRecalling when I first wrote in large characters,\nLearning from men who drank wine and composed poems.\nHad not true friends urged me on like metal and stone,\nForty-five years would have passed in vain.\n\n**Certainty**\nCertainly, in this world, only good deeds,\nNot by heaven or earth, but by one’s own heart.\nDo not cease because the effect seems distant—\nStrive further, and greater merit will come.\n\n**The Vague and Indistinct**\nVague and indistinct, yin and yang first transform,\nMisty and swirling, heaven and earth begin their revolutions.\nAmidst them, a fleeting moment of fine scenery—\nHow to find the skill to put it into words?\n\n**Thanking Junshi and Duanning for Their Poems**\nThey say Kunlun abounds in fine jade,\nThe world tells of the bright pearls of the deep sea.\nSuch tales may lack proof,\nBut what I keep at home is no empty claim.\n\n**On Courage**\nOne who excels me in courage—\nWhen it comes to benevolence, how could I yield to a teacher?\nCourage must be tempered by benevolence,\nBenevolence must rely on courage.\n\n**None Like**\nNone are as close as father and son,\nNone as distant as the barbarian tribes.\nYet even barbarians may reach harmony,\nWhile father and son may part in estrangement.\n\nNone are as kind as father and son,\nNone as righteous as lord and minister.\nIf even these two may fail,\nWhat need to speak of the rest?\n\nLord and minister uphold righteousness,\nFather and son uphold kindness.\nIf righteousness is lost, they become enemy states,\nIf kindness is lost, they become strangers on the road.\n\n**Neighborhood**\nNeighbors passing time in leisure—\nA flourishing sign of great peace.\nMy village abounds in good men,\nAll the more unlike other lands.\n\nA flourishing sign of great peace,\nThe world’s finest talents.\nOn days when the world knows no trouble,\nAll come to Luoyang.\n\n**Thinking of a Friend**\nMy desire to see you never ceases,\nYet long parted, what can be done of this feeling?\nThough clouds and mist lie but a short distance away,\nWe cannot often meet.\n\n**Loyalty and Trust**\nLoyalty and trust are most sincere toward others,\nIn ordinary times, it is not that ghosts and spirits are slighted.\nWhy must they be reserved only for rivers and lakes,\nAnd practiced only when hardship strikes close?\n\n**In Reply to Zhang Chun, Secretarial Aide**\nI fear to recall the past in old age,\nAll the more when I see the sorrowful poems of my late father.\nYet there is a broken verse that brings some comfort—\nNow, whose descendants are weaker than mine?\n\n**In Reply to Master Yin Chuchu**\nA land of joy long allows men to avoid strife,\nHow else to describe a heart so pure?\nYet how dare I aspire to follow in such lofty footsteps?\nOne may scale perilous heights without need of steps.\n\n**In Reply to Wang Maozhi’s Gift of Wine and Sichuan Paper**\nWhite sheep’s jade dust is truly a fine thing,\nJust when my arm aches and my head pains me.\nWine brings half a tipsy inspiration,\nWhy call a doctor when seclusion suffices?\n\n**To the Gentlemen of the Anling County Registry**\nBeneath the brocade-screened mountains, a fine place to dwell,\nWhere flowers, moon, wind, and mist remain unchanged.\nI hear that lately, those with long sleeves pass by,\nLingering before the woods on horseback for hours.\n\n**Human Sentiments**\nAncient affairs compared to present ones—\nPeople of today are but people of old.\nOnly if feelings are not yet fully shared,\nOnce shared, they naturally draw close.\n\n**Why So?**\nWhy is the plum tart?\nWhy is salt salty?\nWhy is tea bitter?\nWhy is shepherd’s purse sweet?\n\n**Heaven’s Hearing**\nHeaven’s hearing is silent, without sound,\nWhere in the vast blue to seek it?\nNeither high nor far—\nIt lies entirely in the human heart.\n\n**White-Haired**\nThough the five blessings⁴ are hard to attain in full,\nThe three misfortunes⁵ have not befallen me.\nOn days of great peace, without trouble,\nI become a white-haired old man.\n\n**Heaven’s Will**\nMen can speak and thus perceive,\nHeaven’s will is wordless—do not deceive it.\nDo not say that silence means nothing happens—\nThis is hardly something the common crowd can know.\n\n**Thanking the Magistrate of Shou’an for the Deed to Shenlin Mountain**\nIn the southwest stands a towering mountain,\nIts jagged peaks encircling like Penglai.⁶\nWithin lies a place fit to dwell,\nWhere springs are sweet, trees lush, and dust does not rise.\nHow generous is the intent of you gentlemen,\nWho swiftly agreed and granted it like thunder.\nWhen the waves of Tianjin calm in the eighth month,\nI may take a raft and visit it once.\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Wang Anzhi, Junior Vice Minister, Who Teased That Anzhi Was Not Abandoning Yaofu**\nAnzhi has not abandoned Yaofu,\nYet fears others may slander him deeply.\nKaishu once spoke and was found at fault,\nXi Chun later said he was innocent.\nOur feelings remain as before,\nAnd suddenly, cups and plates are brought out again.\n\n---\n¹ *Shi He* (噬嗑): A hexagram in the *Book of Changes* (Yijing), often associated with biting through obstacles or exchange.\n² *Wutong* (梧桐): Chinese parasol tree, often symbolizing refinement or melancholy in poetry.\n³ *Dragon Diagram Scholar* (龙图): A title for officials versed in the *Book of Changes* or cosmology.\n⁴ *Five blessings* (五福): Longevity, wealth, health, virtue, and a peaceful death.\n⁵ *Three misfortunes* (三殇): Early death of children, misfortune in middle age, or dying without heirs.\n⁶ *Penglai* (蓬莱): A mythical island of immortals in Daoist lore.\n\nHere begins the translation:\n\n---\n\nI now believe your heart remains steadfast through the cold years,\nAnd Yaofu has not been abandoned by you.\n\n**Chant of the Small Cart**\nSince thrice I snapped the leather bindings of my books,\nTwelve years have passed without reading.\nThe long days dissolve in the great *□* son’s chamber,\nWhile from the small cart I gaze upon the azure sky.\nLeisurely, I become master of waters, bamboos, clouds, and mountains;\nQuietly, I gain sway over wind, flowers, snow, and moon.\nIn the space between bowing and rising, all is joy—\nLet others say I resemble an immortal.\n\n**Evening Stroll Chant**\nAn evening stroll on Shangyang Dyke,\nStaff of *qiong* bamboo in hand.\nSilently following the fragrant grasses,\nLeisurely chasing the wild clouds home.\nThe moon emerges above the pine tips,\nThe wind arrives at the duckweed’s edge.\nSuch scenes within the grove—\nHow many truly know them?\n\n**Plucking Flowers Chant**\nThings exist for the myriad people,\nHumans are the spirits of all things.\nHumans cannot live without things,\nThings flourish only through humans.\nMale and female are born of Heaven,\nHusband and wife are made by humans.\nBeyond Heaven and humans,\nAll else is but empty name.\n\n**In Reply to Gentleman Ren Kaishu and His Brother’s Visit**\nBamboo shadows flicker as the game of chess ends,\nIdle thoughts drift to the Nest of Peace.\nLong unseen in these quiet times,\nYet fortune brings you riding side by side.\nYour favor cannot be matched by gold,\nNor your praise surpassed by embroidered robes.\nEver fond of poetry,\nYou’ve led me into this enchantment.\n\n**Minor Spring Days**\nThe eighth month, a minor springtime,\nLike a man in his vigorous youth.\nTo eke out life is indeed meaningful,\nYet to reverse aging remains beyond reach.\nIf one possesses the arts of immortals,\nEven grasses and trees may bloom anew.\nWho knows if in days of great peace,\nThe world may resemble Yao’s reign?\n\n**Deep Autumn Chant**\nAll year round, no affairs trouble me,\nFlowers bloom in all four seasons.\nThe small cart carries me forth in high spirits,\nWherever I arrive feels like home.\n\n**Mid-Autumn Chant**\nMid-autumn’s light is fine,\nAll the more so with the moon full and round.\nMost people cherish such moments,\nYet how can one bear solitude?\nClear skies and good company,\nFine wine and a body at ease—\nIf any of these four are lacking,\nThis joy cannot be complete.\n\n**Chant While Strolling by the Moonlit Pond with Gentleman Cheng and His Son**\nGrass soft, sand smooth, wind gently flowing,\nClouds light, sun pale, willows gently swaying.\nWild words unremembered—what was said?\nDeep drinking never matched this cup.\nThe scene is fine, so we wander at leisure,\nFriends’ joy—how could we not open our hearts?\nWe vow to savor such delightful moments,\nYet fear such delights may not soon return.\n\n**Autumn Gazing Chant**\nGrass color blends with cloud color,\nMountain light meets water light.\nA towering pavilion, a hundred feet high,\nA few lines of wild geese in flight.\n\n**Leisure Chant**\nIn spring, I admire Luoyang’s flowers;\nIn autumn, I play beneath Tianjin’s moon.\nIn summer, I don the winds of Song Mountain;\nIn winter, I delight in Longshan’s snow.\n\n**On Viewing Master Chen Xiyi’s Portrait and Calligraphy**\nNever seen Xiyi’s true form,\nNever seen Xiyi’s traces;\nOnly heard Xiyi’s name,\nYet Xiyi’s heart remains unknown.\nUntil I saw Xiyi’s traces,\nAnd then beheld Xiyi’s true form.\nOnly then did I know that through past and present,\nThe world has always had such men.\nXiyi’s true form is worth beholding,\nXiyi’s ink may be passed down.\nXiyi’s heart—a single piece—\nCannot be spoken, yet cannot be unspoken.\n\n**In Reply to Junshi, Minister Duanming, on His Visit to the Divine Forest of Du’an**\nI have claimed a secluded mountain for my dwelling,\nFar removed from the dust of profit and fame.\nThe four seasons determine my wanderings,\nUnmoved even by summons to come and go.\n\n**Apricot Blossoms Fragrance**\nA guest speaks of affairs in some prefecture,\nSchemes endless, boundless.\nI, startled, remain silent—\nOnly greedy to inhale the apricot’s fragrance.\n\n**Evening Stroll at Tianjin**\nThe *zhi*-canopied carriages long since sparse,\nEvening clouds stretch empty to the north.\nThis thousand-year-old imperial city,\nA single stretch of idle palaces and towers.\nThe imperial parks still extend,\nThe towering eaves remain jagged.\nThe bridge arches like a rainbow,\nThe dyke curves like the new moon.\nThe banks of the winding stream have deepened,\nThe Han and Tang eras have long since faded.\nA lone figure sits in the high pavilion,\nIdly witnessing the rise and fall of dynasties.\n\n**Joyful Chant**\nThe sun departs, the moon arrives,\nAn end gives way to a new beginning.\nHalf its journey in the heavens,\nHalf beneath the earth.\nIn its illumination,\nThere is no sorrow, only joy.\nWho am I?\nYet joy ceaselessly fills me.\n\n**Self-Portrait Eulogy**\nPine and cassia in conduct,\nOriole and flower in literary talent.\nThe bearing of rivers and mountains,\nThe sentiments of wind and moon.\nBorrowing your visage,\nAssuming your form.\nIn the leisure of the Nine’s remainder,\nI come and go at ease.\n(The Nine refers to the Supreme Ultimate.)\n\n**Extravagance Chant**\nExtravagance must not reach its limit,\nLuxury must not be exhausted.\nTo reach the limit is to invite disaster,\nTo exhaust it is to court calamity.\n\n**Abundance Chant**\nIn the world’s ordinary state,\nHarm outweighs benefit,\nChaos outweighs order,\nSorrow outweighs joy.\nHow can human life\nEscape this?\nHow can my life\nBe consumed by external matters?\n\n**Fear and Love Chant**\nHumans possess true nature,\nAnd all things align.\nHumans lack true nature,\nAnd all things fall into ruin.\nFailing in benevolence,\nWrong is taken for right.\nFailing in authority,\nRight is taken for wrong.\nWith benevolence and authority lost,\nWhat do fear and love know?\nUnknowing of fear and love,\nWhat use are benevolence and authority?\nUnrestrained joy and anger—\nFew avoid this fate.\nMen and women alike\nShould take heed.\n\n**Autumn Pavilion**\nLeaning on the autumn pavilion’s railing,\nThe human heart—how still it feels.\nHeaven and Earth in this year’s months,\nTang and Han in these ancient mountains and rivers.\nThe pale sun before the frost,\nThe sparse sky after the rain.\nEven the finest painter’s brush\nCannot capture this sentiment.\n\n**Floating Life Chant**\nLife floats at dawn’s edge,\nGrateful to add another year.\nMovement may bring regret,\nSeeking perfection may not bring wholeness.\nMatters of the human heart,\nWords of the nature of things.\nThough the world is vast,\nWho can say it is not so?\n\n**Beyond Strength Chant**\nTo make little seem much,\nTo make nothing seem something.\nStriving beyond one’s strength\nCannot last long.\n\n**In Gratitude to Academician Fu Qinzhi for His Visit**\nNothing is longer than Heaven,\nNothing greater than Earth.\nEven Heaven and Earth have limits,\nHow can the rest be worth calculating?\nWorldly attitudes shift in an instant,\nHuman feelings stop at this.\nEven in achieving great deeds,\nOne relies on mighty influence.\nIf fortune aligns,\nTake care not to force matters.\nThough stern as frost and snow,\nRemain unchanging as pine and cassia.\nJust as I lament our long separation,\nI rejoice in your arrival by way of principle.\nTwenty years apart,\nYet you still recall my haggard face.\n\n**Snow Appreciation Chant**\n\n**Snowflakes and Wine**\n\nOne flake, two flakes—snow drifts down,\nThree cups, five cups—wine warms the brow.\nSuch scenes defy all description,\nAs if heaven and earth had just begun their weaving.\n\n**In Reply to Fu Qinzhi**\n\nQinzhi said to me:\n\"To chant many poems is not as good as chanting few;\nTo chant few poems is not as good as chanting none.\"\nI said to Qinzhi:\n\"Neither many nor few,\nNeither none nor must—\nYet chant I do.\nOrchids in the room cannot but fragrance spread,\nBronze and stone struck cannot but sound be made.\nFor evil, grieve—but not to excess;\nFor good, rejoice—but not to indulgence.\"\n\n**Strolling by Moonlit Pond**\n\nFollowing fragrant grasses, I wander far,\nLingering for love of clear ripples, I return late.\nWalking alone, chanting alone, sitting alone,\nIn the season’s first coolness, ere winter’s chill.\n\n**Chant on Confucius**\n\nConfucius was born in Lu, before my time,\nA thousand and five hundred years since the Sage’s light.\nWho today can grasp this Dao?\nIn his day, men compared him to Heaven.\nKings and emperors ruled the Central Plains,\nFathers and sons, lords and ministers—power passed down for ages.\nThe River yields no chart; I accept this fate,\nYet the meaning of refining the Classics was never in vain.\n\n**In Gratitude to Monk Yuanyi for His Gift of a Poetry Scroll**\n\nReading ten of your poems,\nHow they stir my thoughts!\nLike medicine dispelling doubt’s sickness,\nLike tea banishing sleep’s demons.\nThe moon hangs bright above the pines,\nMountains rise steep beyond the waters.\nTomorrow, if time allows,\nI may cross Tianjin Bridge again.\n\n**Self-Portrait (Two Poems)**\n\nWhat is passed down is prized at the feast,\nAll because in those days I found a true teacher.\nI know now that none indulge me like the old,\nAnd I rejoice in a heart as free as spring.\nIf fortune favors, I’ll serve the realm’s affairs;\nRetired, I’ll be a man of mist and waves.\nWithin my breast, one clear and steadfast point—\nUnbetraying of high heaven, unbetraying of men.\n\nA dragon of land and sea, claws sheathed,\nA crane of boundless skies, feathers folded.\nHard to match the steed galloping a thousand *li* a day,\nEasy to content the wren nesting on a single branch.\nBest of all is kindred spirits in carefree ease,\nClimbing high towers and terraces together.\nWe’ve roamed every fine place among clouds and hills—\nWho else is as leisurely as I?\n\n**In Reply to Accountant Du Xiaoyou, Vice Minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, for His Gift of Poems**\n\nGood men abound in every quarter,\nYet I possess not a hair’s worth of goodness.\nWith intent I seek the empty Way,\nWithout merit I idly love the noble.\nStrolling, I watch the still waters;\nSitting, I gaze at the returning clouds.\nOld, I live in an age of peace,\nWhere the court esteems culture and learning.\n\n*Yichuan Jirang Ji, Scroll Twelve Concludes*\n*Yichuan Jirang Ji, Scroll Thirteen*\n\n**For the Kindness of Various Gentlemen in Jointly Purchasing a Garden at Tianjin’s Humble Abode**\n\nDeep gratitude to the gentlemen who bought this garden—\nWithin the city walls, a grove and spring now lie mine.\nSeven thousand paces of level flowing water,\nOver twenty households pooled their silver bright.\nIn Jiayou’s time, I leased a dwelling by divination’s sign;\nIn Xining’s reign, the deed was mine to claim alone.\nBeneath Phoenix Tower, a newfound idle guest,\nIn Morality Lane, an old immortal roams.\nFrom Luo’s banks, the morning breeze fills my sleeves;\nFrom Song’s peaks, the moon’s glow spills through my hall.\nBy the fence, I wear lotus and water-chestnut askew;\nIn the willows’ shade, I shake the dust from talk so light.\nThe streets stretch past bronze camels, flowers ablaze,\nThe dike joins Golden Vale, where grasses spread like silk.\nThough spring’s youth lingers, I may yet venture forth,\nThe sun rides high, yet still I lie abed.\nThe cave named \"Long Life\" should have its master true,\nThe nest called \"Peaceful Joy\"—who holds its sway?\nDare I open wide my eyes upon the world,\nTo see the heavens anew in this human fray?\nAll time I pour into the winecup’s gleam,\nAll creation I shift into verse’s frame.\nI know this patch of earth is fine indeed—\nWorthy of Yaofu’s brush, broad as a beam.\n\n---\n\n**Ten Poems on Viewing Plum Blossoms at Zhang Garden South of the City**\n*Two Poems in Response to Prefect Li Zizhen of Changshui, Matching His Rhymes*\n\nThe east wind overnight split the plum branches wide,\nButterflies and bees dance on, unaware.\nI’ve stuck them in my hair and steeped them in wine—\nLet others say I’m out of step with the times.\n\nPlucked and sniffed, then sniffed again,\nI cherish this fleeting fragrance, pure and keen.\nThanks to the host’s deep kindness,\nThough the blossoms fade, he bids me come again.\n\nCool fragrance, pale beauty—here they thrive,\nNo storm or gale has marred their prime.\nAs the sun dips low, our joy runs deep,\nYet how, once gone, a year slips by in time?\n\nWhen the red sun sinks, our passion burns brighter still,\nAs jade mountains crumble, our spirits rise.\nI choose the fullest branch to break and wear—\nNot to crown my head, but to soothe this heart of mine.\n\nAfter the plum terrace’s feast, what lingers in the mind?\nReturning, I tuck plum blossoms in my carriage small.\nPassersby on the road may well laugh and stare—\nYaofu’s romantic heart is no slight thing at all.\n\nSteeped in wine, their scent grows fiercer yet,\nPlayed on the flute, their notes ring clearer still.\nThis fragrance, this music—where they come from is fine,\nWorthy of a moment’s deep and frozen thrill.\n\nSpring comes early, plum blossoms blaze,\nThough I’ve never been one to drink, I raise my cup.\nAll day on the high terrace south of the city,\nAs if I’d journeyed once more to Jiangnan’s shores.\n\nFour kinds of plum—some yellow, some red,\nTheir hues differ, yet their fragrance is one.\nEven from afar, I must return again,\nTo watch them drift on the wind, drift on the sun.\n\nThough the Five Ridges boast many sights,\nThe Three Rivers, though few, demand another gaze.\nBy the terrace, thousands of trees stand,\nDeep in the heart of this famed garden’s maze.\nFine things in this world are ever to be prized,\nRare talents in the realm are not lightly found.\nWhen next we meet in some distant place,\nWe’ll know this gathering was rare and profound.\n\n---\n\n**In Reply to a Friend**\n\nWho says the idle man holds no sway?\nHis sway lies only in the poem’s sway.\nThe four seasons’ scenes—snow, moon, wind, and flowers—\nAll are gathered in these recent lines.\n\nWhen early spring came to Luoyang’s walls,\nI viewed the plums and chanted plum-blossom verse.\nThough the plum blooms could not be sent afar,\nI sent plum poems to convey my thoughts dispersed.\n\n---\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Junshi, Minister of Protocol, for His Gift of Wine**\n\nThe spring wind scatters snow in wild disarray,\nHow can the woods below not feel forlorn?\nThe frost’s authority is stern, hard to defy—\nA petty man’s gift is hard to repay in kind.\n\n---\n\n**For Secretary Shou’an, Who Sent a Silk Screen from Beneath Jinxia Mountain, Where My Lost Scissors Were Found**\n\nJiangxia could still mourn a fallen shoe,\nShaoyuan wept only for a lost hairpin.\nA single pair of scissors—what’s the loss?\nYet they were long used, and bore my heart within.\n\n---\n\n**For Junshi, Minister of Protocol, for His Gift of Eight Kinds of Mountain Vegetables**\n\nEight kinds of mountain greens, all medicinal sprouts,\nEach plucked from its peak, each bearing its name.\nThe mountain elder, startled by the frost-terrace’s gift,\nBade his mountain wife prepare them herself.\n\n---\n\n**For Junshi, Minister of Protocol, for His Gift of Peonies**\n\nFrom what frost-terrace did this rare bloom arise?\nSent to the hermit by Tianjin’s stream.\nMy wife, startled, rushed to see—\nShe’s only ever pinned sunflowers, it would seem.\n\n---\n\n**For Prefect Wang Xuanhui for His Gift of Wine**\n\nI’d just plucked a flower branch for a distant neighbor,\nFearing I’d lightly waste this spring’s embrace.\nThen came the honor of your gift—two jars of wine,\nAnd the man of Shaoshi Mountain is no longer poor in grace.\n\n---\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Junshi, Minister of Protocol, on Viewing Flowers in Luoyang**\n\nLuoyang holds the finest harmony of qi,\nEvery blade of grass, each tree, invites the gaze.\nEven drinking water brings boundless joy—\nBrother, you often raise your cup in praise.\n\nLuoyang’s flowers and trees are famed throughout the land,\nOur wanderings surpass the scholars’ own.\nMindful of the East Lord’s charge,\nHow could we not linger where beauty’s shown?\n\nLuoyang’s friends are all remarkable men,\nTaking turns to visit gardens as if they were home.\nI laugh at Meng Jiao, so unused to poverty,\nWho boasted of seeing all Chang’an’s blooms in a day alone.\n\nThe southern garden is planted all in peach and plum,\nWhen spring arrives, we hope the flowers bloom soon.\nThanks to the host’s deep kindness,\nThe guest from Tianjin does not come lightly to this boon.\n\n---\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Junshi, Minister of Protocol, for His Gift of Wine**\n\nMost men’s hearts are easily made proud,\nTwo combs are not as fine as a single gourd.\nI fear Meng Guang’s heart grows ever more extravagant—\nFrom now on, she may scorn even purple lingzhi shoots.\n\n---\n\n**Chant of Late Spring**\n\nIn the woods, I often rise from sleep late,\nNow even the carriages and horses grow rare.\nSpring deepens, the days lengthen, the curtains hang low,\nIn the windless courtyard, flowers drift through the air.\n\n---\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Vice-Marshal Gong Zhang of Zhenrong Garrison**\n\nFifteen years ago, I first met you,\nAnd from that meeting, our bond felt like kin.\nThough in the woods there’s little to do,\nMy heart cannot help but long for old friends again.\n\nComparing all things to their very core,\nEven red sincerity must yield to truth’s pure light.\nAmong the gatherings of Luoshe, none compare—\nWhen will you come to choose a neighboring site?\n\n---\n\n**Inscription for the Nest of Peaceful Joy**\n\nNothing is more secure than a kingdom at peace,\nNothing more joyful than a year of harvest’s grace.\nIf the kingdom is not at peace, the year brings no yield,\nHow can this nest know health and ease?\n\n---\n\n**Chant of Sorrow and Regret**\n\nI dwell in the city amidst mist and clouds,\nA small hermit by Tianjin’s tide.\nMy work is the classics, my study profound,\nMy life is water and bamboo, side by side.\n\nRegret that clouds veil the moon,\nSorrow that wind mars the flowers’ face.\nBeyond these regrets, beyond this gloom,\nWhat else in the world has time or space?\n\n**Lament and Joy**\n\nWhen Wu Qi first left Wei,\nWhen Zhang Yi suddenly entered Qin.\nThe Western River long received kindness,\nSouthern Chu was deceived again and again.\n\n**Chant of Good and Evil**\n\nThe noble person studies the Dao and attends to fundamentals,\nThe petty person, seeing profit, forgets even life.\nAttending to fundamentals, they do not move against principle,\nSeeing profit, they do not act without bribes.\n\n**Chant of What Is Learned**\n\nWhat people learn,\nIs fundamentally to learn human affairs.\nIf human affairs are not cultivated,\nWhat difference is there in learning nothing?\n\n**The Noble Person’s Conduct**\n\nWhat makes a noble person?\nA noble person is surely one who cultivates themselves.\nKnowing the noble person’s path,\nOne makes others wish to follow and wander with them.\nThey side with righteousness, not profit,\nRemember kindness, not enmity.\nThey praise goodness, not fear evil,\nFavor joy, not sorrow.\n\n**Chant of Reflection**\n\nConfucius reflected twice,\nZengzi thrice examined himself.\nWho am I?\nHow dare I forget self-cultivation?\n\n**Chant of the Soaring Kite**\n\nWho says things have no knowledge?\nAutumn departs, spring returns—never missing their time.\nThis year’s new fledglings have grown,\nWhen they leave, how can they not feel deep attachment?\n\n**The Two Grudges of Zou and Tian**\n\nZou and Tian bore grudges against each other,\nThe diviner’s words—how could they be trusted?\nProfit and harm injure truth to this extent,\nThe Tian family departed, their resentment hard to pacify.\n\n**The Two Generals Sun and Pang**\n\nSun Bin lay in ambush, his strategy called masterful,\nPang Juan drilled into fire—how foolish!\nAll military strategists are deceitful like this,\nYet profit and harm remain unchanged today.\n\n**A Single Word Moves a Person**\n\nNot marrying as a woman,\nNot taking office as a scholar,\nA single word from a man of Qi,\nAnd Tian Zi resigned.\n\n**Chant of the Four Lords**\n\nThe age departed from the Three Kings,\nAffairs fell to the Five Hegemons.\nThe Seven Warring States contended,\nThe Four Lords still vied in splendor.\nMengchang stood first,\nXinling second,\nPingyuan in the middle,\nChunshen last.\n\n**Chunyu Kun’s Admonition on Wine**\n\nWine bestowed by the lord,\nDrunk without tasting its flavor.\nThe law’s enforcers stand before you,\nFear and dread know no end.\nAt such a time,\nOne cup and you are drunk.\n\nThe clan fills the hall,\nFilial and fraternal,\nHonoring elders, respecting the young,\nOld and young in proper order.\nAt such a time,\nTwo cups and you are drunk.\n\nAt the guests’ first seating,\nSolemn and dignified,\nToasts and bows in hundreds,\nRising and descending with ritual.\nAt such a time,\nThree cups and you are drunk.\n\nNeighbors gather,\nLike brothers,\nIn times of harmony and harvest,\nHearts full of joy.\nAt such a time,\nFive cups and you are drunk.\n\nFriends come and go,\nDiscussing the Dao, seeking righteousness,\nDelighting in good things, gladdening the heart,\nClimbing mountains, facing waters.\nAt such a time,\nEight cups and you are drunk.\n\nMen and women sit together,\nCups and goblets uncounted,\nLamps flicker,\nCaps and robes askew.\nAt such a time,\nA full *dan* and you are drunk.\n\n**The Great Fish of the Eastern Sea**\n\nIn the Eastern Sea there is a great fish,\nNo net or snare can come near.\nOnce cast ashore,\nEven ants can trap it.\n\n**The Clay and Wooden Effigy**\n\nClay and wooden effigies,\nTake care not to laugh at each other.\nWhen heaven sends great rain,\nYou can only mourn each other.\n\n**Chant of Defending Against Slander**\n\nTian Dan’s merit covered the state,\nDiao Bo’s words turned the lord’s heart.\nSlander has existed since ancient times,\nYet it could still kill nine men.\n\n**Chant of the Three Sovereigns**\n\nIn the age of the Three Sovereigns, all was bright and harmonious,\nEven the nests of magpies and crows could be peered into from below.\n\nAt that time, the feeling was just the same—\nEarly spring’s morning air, the season’s prime.\n\n**Chant of the Five Emperors**\n\nIn the age of the Five Emperors, all was like midday’s glow,\nWith radiant culture and rites in full flow.\nNo era before or since has matched such grace,\nBeyond this, all else falls from that place.\n\n**Chant of the Three Kings**\n\nThe age of the Three Kings was like autumn’s reign,\nWith power’s weight and lightness, each had its claim.\nDeep valleys became hills, cliffs turned to dells,\nEver shifting, the earth itself never stills.\n\n**Chant of the Five Hegemons**\n\nThe time of the Five Hegemons was like winter’s hold,\nThough of the Three Dynasties, none shared its mold.\nEven then, Guan and Yan wielded power’s sway,\nWhere father and son, lord and minister, still held sway.\n\n**Chant of the Seven States**\n\nThe Seven States’ schemes were plain to see,\nAs Su and Zhang rose—yet was this just decree?\nIn those days, how did the world align?\nMen of the marketplace became ministers divine.\n\n**Sweeping the Land Chant**\n\nIn Guan and Yan’s time, some order remained,\nBut Su and Zhang’s rise left no name unstained.\nFrom whence came the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors’ line?\nSweep the Central Plains clean and await peace divine.\n\n**Heaven and Man Chant**\n\nThough Fu Xi, Yao, and Shun may never return,\nTang, Wu, Huan, and Wen’s paths still may be learned.\nTimes differ, affairs change—yet both align,\nPart by Heaven’s Dao, part by man’s design.\n\n**Profit and Harm Chant**\n\nHound and hare both perish,\nClam and snipe locked in strife.\nThe old fisherman sits,\nReaping gain from their life.\n\n**Timeliness Chant**\n\nIn its prime, the steed’s speed\nOutpaces all in its prime.\nYet in decline, even nags\nLeave it far behind in time.\nWhen time and task align,\nA word or laugh suffices to command.\nBut when time shifts and tasks depart,\nEven death serves no demand.\n\n**Two Teachings Chant**\n\nTo govern without changing customs,\nTo teach without altering the people—\nGan Long’s words may yet hold sway.\nThe common folk cling to habit,\nScholars drown in what they’ve heard.\nShang Yang’s way stands apart—\nNot as others have averred.\n\n**Words and Deeds Chant**\n\nWords that never stray from *ren*,\nDeeds that never stray from *yi*—\nHeaven itself will bless such men,\nAll good fortune shall be nigh.\nWords that turn from *ren* away,\nDeeds that stray from *yi*’s way—\nHeaven will not bless such play,\nWho then can such men obey?\nThere was Lord Shang, who spurned *yi*,\nRavaged *ren* with cruel decree.\nHis laws became his own undoing,\nHis body torn by chariots’ shearing.\nNow we know: to walk in *yi*,\nTo cultivate *ren* with care,\nIs to be a man who gains\nYears added to his span.\n\n**Order and Chaos Chant**\n\nWhen profit leads the way,\nWhen brush and tongue hold sway,\nFamine follows close behind,\nBandits rise like swarming bees.\nWhen filial piety leads the way,\nSun and moon shine long each day,\nYears bring peace, the land is blessed,\nLife is long, the body rests.\n\n**Great Peace Chant**\n\nThe old find their care,\nThe young find their support,\nThe toiling find their fare,\nThe dead find their grave’s report.\n\n**Lord Shang Chant**\n\nLord Shang won his lord’s trust, wielding law’s might,\nZhao Liang spoke truth day and night.\nWhen his decrees burned like fire’s glow,\nHow could he know his body would be torn asunder so?\n\n**He Who Holds the World in Heart**\n\nHe who holds the world in heart,\nWho resolves the affairs of men—\nSuch a one plays his part.\n\n**Is It Only for the Present?**\n\nIs it only for the present one seeks?\nSeeking the past is no easier feat.\n\n**First Emperor Chant**\n\nNine thousand days he swallowed the land,\nFifteen years he ruled all under heaven.\nThe blood of the pit had not yet dried when Gaozu came,\nAnd the mounds of Mount Li were already desolate.\n\n**On Delusion Chant**\n\nTo feign virtue with cunning schemes,\nTo gloss over faults with hidden guile—\nThough human hearts may be obscure,\nThe Dao of Heaven remains ever clear.\nWhen hands and feet are all exposed,\nHow can mere words be trusted still?\n\n**Heaven and Earth Chant**\n\nWith nine, the host of dragons appears,\nBringing forth the ten thousand things.\nWith six, eternal constancy is blessed,\nFor the firmness of Qian brings advantage.\nThe four images with nine complete\nMake thirty-six in all.\nThe four images with six complete\nMake twenty-four in sum.\nHow can nine and six alone\nEncompass all the world’s affairs?\n\n**Primordial Epoch of the *Supreme Principles Governing the World* Chant**\n\nHeaven and earth are like a chariot’s canopy and axle,\nCovering and bearing—how high, how vast?\nSun and moon are like ants on a millstone,\nEndlessly circling without cease.\nThe years above and below,\nTheir numbers are hard to fathom.\nYet take but one epoch—\nIts principles may still be known.\nTwelve myriad, nine thousand six hundred,\nAnd three thousand years between,\nUp to the traces of today,\nOrder and chaos, rise and fall,\nAll are recorded in the annals.\nI can grasp them as one thread,\nAs if I had lived them myself.\n\n**Responsive Dragon Chant**\n\nThe dragon, creature of yang,\nMoves in accord with the seasons,\nFirst to emerge among the ten thousand things,\nRoaming the six voids.\nIt can dive, it can rise,\nIt can inhale, it can exhale,\nIt can grow vast, it can shrink small,\nIt can be, it can cease to be.\n\n**Where Lies the Land of Immortals?**\n\nWhere lies the land of immortals?\nThe land of immortals is not apart from this chamber.\nBefore the eyes, no tedium,\nWithin the heart, a cool clarity.\nIn stillness, heaven and earth are vast,\nIn leisure, sun and moon stretch long.\nIf one can find contentment here,\nIt surpasses all other thoughts.\n\n**In Gratitude to Attendant Officer Song for the Gift of a White Ox**\n\nIts coat like frost and snow, its eyes like crimson,\nEars and horns square and even, over three feet tall.\nIts form is strange, its mouth fit to plow the wilds,\nIts nature tame, well-suited to draw a carriage in peace.\nWhere it grazes by the water, even dragons yield,\nWhen led beneath the moon, hares may be driven.\nFrom now on, in the paintings of Luoyang,\nThe artist’s brush will strive anew.\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Vice Director Wang Anzhi’s Poem on the Six Elders, Hastily Composed**\n\nSix elders, hoary-haired, their temples like frost,\nTheir hearts at ease, though age may seem like folly.\nTogether they choose gardens and pools—what harm in delight?\nWith cups and platters they rejoice, never too busy.\nWith staff and sandals they wander through a thousand years’ fate,\nTheir robes and headscarves thick with the fragrance of ten thousand flowers.\nOur gatherings, so freely given, now number seven—\nAnd with autumn’s approach, the air grows cool.\n\n**Six Elders, Joined by You and Your Son**\n\nSix elders, joined by you and your son,\nIn leisurely posts, far from reckless abandon.\nGatherings without care are easily joyful,\nDuties toward others are hard to call busy.\nTender willows droop, greener still,\nDew-kissed peaches blush, warm and fragrant.\nDrunk in spring, lying beneath the blossoms,\nJust as the shade brings its own cool.\n\n**Who Among the Six Elders Yields to Youth?**\n\nWho among the six elders yields to youth’s domain?\nAge need not shame them—they indulge their whims.\nTogether in stillness, they watch things move,\nIn leisure, they observe others’ haste.\nThe heart of heaven, the full moon, the toad stirs,\nOn the water’s surface, the breeze, the lotus fragrance.\nWho would believe there is sorrow in this world?\nNew wine is brewed, the scene is cool.\n\n**Six Men Gather in Prosperous Times**\n\nSix men gather in prosperous times—\nWhat reason have they not to let loose?\nGardens and groves cover the land, all theirs to share,\nWind and moon fill the sky, aiding their poetic toil.\nTheir writings pluck the finest blooms of Han and Tang,\nTheir elegance is steeped in the fragrance of Li and Du.\nBy the water’s edge, beneath the bamboo, in ease—\nNo worldly dust, only cool clarity.\n\n**Six Guests Roam a Land of Drunkenness**\n\nSix guests roam a land of drunkenness,\nFar from the madness of common speech.\nTogether they rejoice in long-lasting peace,\nVying in song and verse, seeking the finest lines.\nBy the moonlit pond, fruits ripen in the grove,\nIn Golden Valley’s well, the tea’s aroma rises.\nBeneath the thousand-year pine, dust is swept away,\nSleeves and lapels, though windless, feel cool.\n\n**The Rustic, Now Seventh Among the Elders**\n\nThe rustic, now seventh among the elders,\nKnows only rustic, unrefined abandon.\nEach day he arranges his verses with care,\nEach year he hurries to seize his leisure.\nAt summer’s end, he delights in new wine’s taste,\nAt spring’s beginning, he loves the early plum’s fragrance.\nWhy must he do so?\nHe cannot bear the chill in his heart.\n\n**Singing Wildly in the Forest, Unfettered by Rhyme**\n\nSinging wildly in the forest, unshackled by rhyme—\nHow could such singing be called wild if bound by form?\nWhere the small carriage rolls, orioles and flowers clamor,\nWhen the great brush falls, gods and ghosts scurry.\nThe gate is barred, the market’s din far off,\nThe wall is opened, the window a jar—ivy and vines scent the air.\nOne thing in all the world is hard to find:\nThe cool breeze of the Luo River brushing the face.\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Vice Director Zhang Jingzhi’s Gift of Three Study Treasures**\n\nThree treasures of the study, all refined,\nYet in thanks, I fret no fine lines come.\nI wish to praise this age of peace in song,\nBut alas, my talent does not match its splendor.\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Vice Director Wang Anzhi’s Poem Thanking the Wealthy Minister**\n\nHaving seen much favor and disgrace, what is there to fear?\nLeaving the dust behind, I rejoice in my own clarity.\nIn leisure, the qi of heaven and earth is vast,\nIn stillness, the light of time and space is pure.\nMy plain deeds and great plans leave no shame,\nMy full merit in heaven and earth is not in vain.\nHow fortunate this rustic, to meet such prosperous times—\nA hundred years and more, the world at peace.\n\n**Reed and Willow Chant Before the Peaceful Nest**\n\nBefore the Peaceful Nest, a small river bends,\nNew reeds and slender willows, green year after year.\nBefore my eyes, the light of time is good enough—\nWho says life is ever lacking?\n\n**Jar-Window Chant**\n\nA broken jar, gladly discarded,\nYet when gathered, it serves a purpose.\nWhen used, it must be fitted to the mouth,\nWhen placed, it can hold a bed.\nNo need for carved windows or grand halls,\nIt can turn back the light of sun and moon.\nLying beneath it in peace,\nOne may compare to the sages of old.\n\n**Two Sorrows of Life**\n\nLife is ever burdened by two sorrows,\nSorrow in death, sorrow in living—hard to escape.\nSome exhaust their strength chasing profit,\nOthers wear their hearts out seeking fame.\nMany fear they will grasp it too late,\nYet before old age, their hair turns white.\nWhat merit have I to stand above them?\nAmidst it all, I alone raise my arms, free of care.\n\n**Self-Portrait**\n\nIn all the world, none like me,\nIgnorant, with no great skill.\nIn years and looks, like Li Wenshuang,\nIn bearing, like He Zhizhang.\nOften sitting still, drinking tea,\nSometimes strolling, clad in Daoist robes.\n\nDo not mock another’s path,\nFor peace and joy are my homeland.\n\n**Mid-Autumn Moon**\nOnce a year comes Mid-Autumn night,\nNine times out of ten the sky is overcast.\nTo seek fullness, wait for midnight’s hour;\nFor brightness, watch until the moon stands high.\nWhere clouds part, the heart’s depth is revealed;\nSleepless, gazing, the mind grows ever keener.\nWe praise the ancients’ fine poetic lines,\nYet how can they match sharing this night across a thousand miles?\n\n**Song of the Small Cart**\nSpring warmth and autumn cool, the seasons fair,\nYears of plenty, health unbroken, times serene.\nOver grass soft as a mat, it rolls with ease,\nThrough blossoms bright as brocade, it moves at leisure.\n\n**A Dream of Home**\nIn dreams I reached my native land,\nA land unseen for twenty years.\nDimly, a new realm came in sight,\nVaguely, old mountains and rivers appeared.\nMy body lay beyond mist and clouds,\nMy home stood by the roadside.\nAwake, the vision lingered still,\nA fleeting moment—all was desolate.\n\n**Evening Stroll by the Luo River Sands**\nAn evening stroll by the Luo River sands,\nCountless stones upon the shore.\nGreen and yellow, long and short,\nLarge and small, square and round.\nThough they number beyond reckoning,\nTheir true use is hard to find.\nWhere lies the fabled *langgan* jade?\nOnly sighs remain.\n\n**Five Poems in Early Autumn, Harmonizing with Li Wenshi**\n\n**I**\nA single rain washes the palace eaves,\nThe Three Rivers’ scene grows clear.\nForest winds carry the breath of *hao*,\nLeaves of trees send forth the sound of *shang*.\nSuddenly, lotus buds appear;\nSoon, chrysanthemums will bloom.\nIn these peaceful times, I grow old—\nHow can I repay this life of ease?\n\n**II**\nA narrow path, freshly rinsed by rain,\nA secluded courtyard, thick with moss.\nBefore the wind, a mind at leisure,\nBeneath the steps, quiet pacing.\nI do not resign to aging bones,\nNor yield to the press of fleeting years.\nFrom time to time, I rest on fragrant grass,\nGrateful for wine to share with friends.\n\n**III**\nThe autumn of Wang Jin has arrived,\nThe scorching sun’s glow begins to fade.\nCan one nurture the *zhi* like Mengzi?\nIn quiet dwelling, will I yield to Pan?\nBetween bamboo, wind rustles leaf by leaf,\nThrough pine crevices, the moon glows round.\nThe Luo She abounds with worthy friends—\nWith each, joy may be shared.\n\n**IV**\nBy the pool, trailing willows sway,\nBy the rail, late flowers smile.\nFaded lotus droops its tattered canopy,\nAncient cypress reveals its gnarled branches.\nAs the year wanes, I marvel at time’s ways,\nIn old age, I cherish the splendor of things.\nThe winds of Dongling have not ceased—\nI recall the melons of my homeland.\n\n**V**\nThe sun’s rays fade in thinning clouds,\nThe treetops’ leaves turn slowly gold.\nHow can one bear the changing hues?\nThrough to the end, frost will encroach.\nWine no longer brings intoxication,\nThe wind easily brings chill.\nIn old age, what does one desire?\nOnly peace and well-being, nothing more.\n\n**What Does Yaofu Possess?**\nWhat does Yaofu possess?\nA single hue, in harmony with Heaven.\nIn summer, he dwells in the Cave of Longevity,\nIn winter, resides in the Nest of Peace.\nOrioles and blossoms offer carefree delight,\nWind and moonlight aid his recitations.\nI surmise that among human joys,\nNone surpass my own abundance.\n\n**Longing for the Days When I First Learned to Speak**\nLong have I recalled those fleeting words,\nWhen at dawn I played before my parents.\nJust learning to walk, I knelt at their knees;\nNow aged, my temples are streaked with silver.\nOnce, at four or five years old,\nNow, sixty years have passed.\nYet I still delight in my children’s play—\nJoy and tears mingle together.\n\n**In Reply to a Friend**\nWhat is called a good place to dwell?\nNot in strength or literary skill.\nTo act or rest lies within oneself,\nRight or wrong is struck by others.\nCounting the gains of sages past,\nSurveying worldly affairs, truth is required.\nFortune and misfortune, regret and shame arise from action,\nResolute, steadfast, and reticent—these approach *ren*.\nChange places, and all remains the same—why quarrel?\nSilent yet trusted, no need for lengthy explanation.\nThough dwelling among barbarians, one may still walk the Way,\nNo fear in one’s village, though bonds may not be close.\n\n**Sitting Alone, Reciting**\nHeaven’s decree is clear and insistent,\nYet many refuse to heed.\nThe four seasons each have their scenes,\nThe myriad things all bear feeling.\nFortune and misfortune are matters before our eyes,\nRight and wrong are names left behind.\nWho would waste their *qi* on idle strife,\nVainly contending with the world?\n\n**Again**\nHeaven’s intent is plain to see,\nYet many refuse to follow.\nOrioles and blossoms, spring’s sudden warmth,\nWind and moonlight, rain’s first clearing.\nSitting in stillness, thoughts grow clear,\nReciting at leisure, the heart finds joy.\nWho would waste their *qi* on idle strife,\nVainly contending with the world?\n\n**Thoughts Not Yet Arisen in the Heart**\nThoughts not yet arisen in the heart,\nWords not yet spoken from the mouth.\nNo spirit may peer within,\nNo person may find fault.\nThe noble one values vigilance in solitude,\nAbove, unashamed before the rafters’ hidden gaze.\nBoth gods and men reside in my heart—\nThe mouth must follow in their wake.\n\n**Reciting in Self-Delight**\nWithin the city of Jiaoru,\nBeneath the Phoenix Tower;\nIn courtyards of wind and moonlight,\nOn terraces of orioles and blossoms.\nTimes of harmony, years of plenty,\nStrolling in leisure, sitting in stillness;\nFriends well, body at ease,\nRefined recitations, elegant discourse.\n\n**Song of the Old Man**\nA hoary old man,\nWeary of all things.\nOld objects, half-forgotten,\nOld friends, rarely met.\nHidden flowers linger in mist,\nBroken dreams scatter with the wind.\nI only wish for the world—\nTimes of peace, years of plenty.\n\n**Song of the Iron Ruyi**\nThis object is wrought of iron,\nNever held in vain.\nEver beside the great *□* master,\nForever with the small cart’s child.\nStriking, it shatters coral,\nTapping, it chips teeth.\nWho would learn from such a lot?\nOnly to enter the lash’s reach.\n\n**Reciting on Daoist Robes**\nDaoist ritual employs this robe and kerchief,\nBowing only to stars, not to men.\nWhy must Yaofu bow?\nHow can one know men are not stars?\n\nDaoist ritual employs this kerchief and robe,\nBeyond the master, whom else would I bow to?\nWhy must Yaofu bow?\nHow can one know men are not my teachers?\n\nIn the attire of a Daoist—loose robes, dust whisk, and cap—\nCasual visits among neighbors are the norm.\nI hear that grotto heavens are much the same—\nMy homeland is no different from the immortals’ realm.\n\nIf the Dao resides only in the heart,\nThe work of creation may be sought within.\nIf one claims robes and kerchiefs make the Dao,\nHow dare Yaofu don such garments?\n\n**Reciting on Four Matters**\nEyes, only when the time is right, then see;\nEars, only when the time is right, then hear;\nMouth, only when the time is right, then speak;\nBody, only when the time is right, then act.\nAhead, no rich emoluments,\nBehind, no mighty armies.\nOnly where *yi* resides—\nWhat care for profit or fame?\n\n**Reciting on a Chance Thought**\nIn my prime, I toiled and raced,\nAccepting office as my lot.\nWhat I gained was but a pittance,\nWhat I lost was beyond measure.\nToday passes like a morning,\nTomorrow slips by like an evening.\nInevitably, like a traveler on the road,\nI am worn down by toil and labor.\n\n**Reciting on Four Matters**\nThere are four gatherings one should not attend,\nThere are four times one should not venture forth.\nNeither noble nor base,\nNeither fixed nor certain.\nPublic assemblies, life celebrations, grand feasts, drinking parties—\nBitter cold, scorching heat, fierce winds, torrential rain.\nIn the village lanes, leisurely visits,\nBody at ease, heart naturally content.\nThus for thirty years,\nFortunate to live in days of peace.\n\n*Yichuan Jirang Ji*, Volume Thirteen concludes\n*Yichuan Jirang Ji*, Volume Fourteen\n\n**Shào Yōng of Yīchuān (Yáofū)**\n\n**Occasional Writing**\nFine food—do not let it sate,\nFor sated, one cannot receive more.\nGood people—do not let them tire,\nFor tired, they cannot endure long.\nA lowly official bows, and others rejoice;\nA high official bows, and others feel shame.\nOfficial rank comes from without—\nWhy should the heart be thus?\n\nTalent high yet fate meager,\nShame to dwell beneath others.\nIf not steadfast in poverty,\nOne does not know the Dao.\n\nThe virtuous and powerful,\nWherever they dwell,\nAre like orchids and irises,\nInspiring love and admiration.\nThe wicked and cruel,\nWherever they dwell,\nAre like tigers and wolves,\nInspiring fear and dread.\n\nA wife too strong brings misfortune to her husband,\nA servant too strong brings misfortune to his master,\nA minister too strong brings misfortune to his lord.\nA tail larger than the body,\nIce harder than frost—\nIf not discerned early,\nThe state falls, the family perishes.\n\n**In Gratitude for the Gift of a Golden Sparrow Inkstone from Advisor Wáng Shèngzhī**\n\nI have often heard of the Bronze Sparrow,\nBut never of the Golden Sparrow.\nAt first, I felt shame before the recluses,\nFor my knowledge of things was not vast.\nFrom whence does the Golden Sparrow emerge?\nIt must come from the sacred peaks.\nSevering the roots of white clouds,\nSplitting the corners of green cliffs.\nOnce carved into a mighty inkstone,\nIt ascends to the imperial archives.\nWater stored within reveals its warmth and luster,\nInk applied shows its depth and flow.\nBy the window, I delight as its mirror-like surface gleams;\nBefore my desk, I marvel as the moon seems to descend.\nSuch a generous gift—how can I repay?\nI must offer uncut jade in return.\nWhy not keep it awhile?\nFor the great transformation requires measured use.\nWhy not keep it awhile?\nFor the worthy are chosen and promoted.\nWhy not keep it awhile?\nFor the treacherous are punished and diminished.\nWhy should it not be kept?\nFor the people’s sake, to bring them peace.\nThen what am I?\nI can only receive this gift with astonishment.\nI must wield a brush as large as a rafter,\nTo avoid deep shame.\n\n**Again, Using the Warm Air of a Sunny Window to Appreciate the Spring of Ink Blossoms—Thanking Advisor Wáng Shèngzhī for the Golden Sparrow Inkstone**\n\nAn inkstone named Golden Sparrow—unmatched in the world,\nIn repayment, I am shamed to lack treasures of the realm.\nYet the state’s scholar has poetry of refined elegance,\nWhere the warm air of a sunny window nurtures the spring of ink blossoms.\n\n**Inscription on the Portrait of Fàn, the Loyal and Illustrious Duke**\nFàn and Shào dwelled in Luòyáng,\nHíyí dwelled on Huà Mountain.\nChén and Shào were recluses,\nWhile the Loyal and Illustrious Duke was a prominent official.\nShào came after Fàn,\nChén came before Fàn.\nThree men bore similar appearances,\nTwo shared connected names.\n\n**Reciting on Observing Things**\nTime brings alternation,\nThings wither and flourish.\nPeople decline and prosper,\nAffairs rise and fall.\n\n**Reciting on Flowers**\nFine wine—could it not detain a guest to drink?\nBeautiful flowers still know to bloom toward people.\nToo tender-hearted to resist the flowers’ intent,\nHow can one leave the full cup before growing drunk?\n\n**Reciting on Rightness and Profit**\nIntent is not as good as rightness,\nRightness is not as good as profit.\nProfit moves people,\nMaking them forget life and death.\nProfit is not as good as rightness,\nRightness is not as good as intent.\nIntent moves people,\nMaking them stir heaven and earth.\n\n**Responding to Zhū Diànzhí’s Gift of a Long Rhyming Poem**\nYour earnest gift in long verse,\nOur village visits span many years.\nThe year’s affairs come full circle,\nSpring’s blossoms follow in radiant succession.\n\n**Trying the Brush**\nThe heart within the human frame is called the sun,\nAble to cast its radiance upon affairs.\nHow is it that the bright sun illumines all eight directions,\nYet seems confined to the lofty terrace of the mind?\nAt home, peace and well-being—poverty is no harm;\nWithout illness, what does thinness matter?\nIn Luòchéng, I laugh and chant loudly,\nWatching the world’s hands and feet scurry in haste.\n\n**Trying the Inkstone**\nWealth and nobility may breed arrogance—few believe it,\nYet do they know how wealth and nobility depart?\nOften, in quietude, time passes well,\nBut I fear idleness brings excessive thought.\nThe sun rises, and the sky is not dark;\nWhen wind comes, how can water remain still?\nIn the world, there is much level ground—\nWhy must one take the shortcut?\n\n**Asking About Seasoning the Cauldron**\nI ask you about seasoning the cauldron—\nDare I inquire into the art of its craft?\nOnly salt and plum are hard to perfect,\nBut are there not ginger and cinnamon to add spice?\nTo blend the broth, one must seek beauty,\nYet how can the many mouths all be satisfied?\nBeware of speaking lightly of the world’s affairs—\nYī and Zhōu were no ordinary men.\n\n**Reading Ancient Poetry**\nLeisurely reading the poems of the ancients,\nI ponder their intent.\nThough ancient and modern times differ,\nTheir intent remains unchanged.\nJoy and anger, sorrow and delight,\nPoverty and wealth, high and low—\nAlas, what is this thing called emotion,\nThat moves people so?\n\n**Bookworm**\nIts form resembles a fish,\nIts heart delights in gnawing books.\nIt dwells always in boxes and baskets,\nNever in rivers or lakes.\nIt causes a thousand kinds of harm,\nYet no one speaks of cooking it.\nYear after year, when summer peaks,\nIt molts and is renewed as before.\n\n**Reciting in a Lean Year**\nA lean year—my heart is not lean,\nA poor household—my Dao is not poor.\nWho knows that within heaven and earth,\nThere exists another fine universe?\n\n**Ultimate Discourse**\nBelow lies the Yellow Springs, above the heavens,\nEach person is granted a hundred years or so.\nYet knowing how many deaths are lived in vain,\nIt is as if one were never born at all.\nTo recognize a bright pearl, one must seek the vast sea;\nTo find fine jade, one must search the famous mountains.\nFirst, one must exhaust all worldly affairs,\nThen may one speak of transcending the world.\n\n**Reciting on Seeking a Mirror**\nA person without a mirror in flowing water\nShould seek a mirror in still water.\nFlowing water has no fixed form,\nStill water has a fixed essence.\nA person without a mirror in water\nShould seek a mirror in others.\nWater reflects a person’s appearance,\nOthers reflect a person’s spirit.\n\n**Reciting on Studying Buddhism**\nFine food and rich robes are not easily endured,\nLong days and seasons—what can one do with sorrow?\nIn youth, seeking fame, I turned to Confucius;\nIn old age, fearing death, I drew near to Śākyamuni.\nFutile to sever ties—ties grow heavier;\nVain to seek relief from illness—illness multiplies.\nThe long river, a strip of silk in the distance,\nFortunately windless—yet waves arise.\n\n**Reciting on Frost and Dew**\nHeaven and earth possess moisture,\nWhich descends in abundance.\n\n**On Frost and Dew (continued)**\nWarm, it becomes heavy dew;\nCold, it becomes thick frost.\nAs dew, the myriad things rejoice;\nAs frost, the myriad things are harmed.\nThese two arise from the selfsame qi—\nHow manifest are grace and might!\n\n**Reciting on Heaven’s Mandate**\nWhat may be entrusted is fate;\nWhat may be relied upon is Heaven.\nMan acts not rashly—\nEvents do not arise by chance.\n\n**On Nature and Disposition**\nTo cultivate form refines nature;\nTo follow traces refines disposition.\nThe worthy follow traces;\nThe sage embodies form.\n\n**Reciting on Heart and Traces**\nThe sage comprehends the heart;\nThe worthy comprehends the traces.\nComprehending the heart knows no bounds;\nComprehending the traces knows no limit.\n\n**Reciting on Observing Things**\nNo thing flourishes in twain;\nNo affair proceeds alone.\nGlory and decay arise in turn;\nWorthy and foolish advance together.\n\n**Reciting on Thought and Care**\nBefore thought and care arise,\nEven spirits and gods cannot know.\nIf not from me,\nThen from whom else?\n\n**In Reply to an Old Friend in Court**\nIn youth I cultivated literature,\nAnd once beheld the splendor of the state.\nThough I have not returned to mountain forests,\nI have never forgotten the furrowed fields.\nDoes the deer in the granary lack ambition?\nThe phoenix and wild goose follow their own way.\nKnowing affairs of today,\nGreat matters demand reflection.\n\n**Reciting on Not Venturing Out in Winter**\nWinter is not that I do not wish to go out—\nWishing to go out, I suffer the shortness of days.\nOld in years, I fear long conversations;\nIn the cold, I dread returning late.\nThe mountain elder’s head is troubled by wind;\nThe affection of village friends runs deep.\nIf you must invite me,\nSpring’s light is not far off.\n\n**Observing Things**\nEarth, through stillness, is square;\nHeaven, through motion, is round.\nHaving rectified the forms of square and round,\nOne then discerns the power of motion and stillness.\nStillness prolonged must yield moisture;\nMotion at its extreme thus ignites.\nMoisture completes the water’s body;\nIgnition fulfills fire’s function.\nWater’s body is received by vessels;\nFire’s function is transmitted by fuel.\nThe body comes after Heaven and Earth;\nThe function arises before Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Reciting on Family and State**\nDepravity and uprightness differ in heart,\nYet family and state share the same body.\nDepravity brings ruin;\nUprightness brings rise.\n\n**Reciting on Depravity and Uprightness**\nThe worthy delight in uprightness;\nThe treacherous delight in depravity.\nDelighting in depravity breeds contention;\nDelighting in uprightness fosters harmony.\n\n**Reciting on Righteousness and Profit**\nThe noble person esteems righteousness;\nThe petty person esteems profit.\nEsteeming profit brings chaos;\nEsteeming righteousness brings order.\n\n**Reciting on Heaven’s Timing**\nMan acts in affairs;\nHeaven’s mandate is timing.\nTiming, once lost, is hard to recover;\nAffairs, once gone, are difficult to pursue.\n\n**Reciting on Grace and Righteousness**\nDeep grace makes one kin;\nWeighty righteousness makes one lord.\nWhen both grace and righteousness are attained,\nOnly then is one called human.\n\n**Reciting on Leisurely Strolls**\nWhat is called a true friend?\nA true friend is not lightly found.\nWithout the ears of Music-Master Kuang,\nHow can there be the zither of Bo Ya?\nThough the mulberry and elm cast their shadows,\nHow could I forget the heart of pine and cassia?\nWalking alone on the moonlit embankment,\nEach step is met with a lofty chant.\n\n**Reciting at One’s Side**\nThe myriad transformations are complete within the body—\nOne must but nurture them deeply.\nWhy is it called a precious mirror?\nOnly because it is wrought of refined gold.\nWine, when scarce, is sipped like tea;\nPoetry, when abundant, is chanted like history.\nYan Yuan found joy within the world’s bounds—\nThe world’s affairs are hard to bear.\n\n**Reciting on Snow**\nFine wine and choice dishes with pipes and strings,\nAll night the cauldron boils in celebration of a bountiful year.\nDeep within the lord’s gates, do they know?\nA million displaced people lie beneath the open sky.\n\n**Self-Composed on the New Year of My Sixty-Fifth Year, Xining 8**\nMy home lies within Luoyang’s walls,\nMoreover by the banks of the Tianjin.\nIn my sixty-fifth year,\nAmid the Song’s flourishing dawn.\nThe southern garden borders the thoroughfare;\nThe northern garden gazes upon twin towers.\nThough dwelling in the capital,\nIt is as if I reside in a mountain stream.\nClear springs trace the channels;\nLush trees adorn the skies.\nCool winds descend through bamboo;\nBright moon appears amid pines.\nBefore me grow orchids and angelica;\nBeneath my gaze, no ice nor embers.\nAt my seat, joy abounds;\nIn my breast, no strife.\nWinter and summer, I do not venture out—\nHeat and cold change in vain.\nGlory and disgrace do not enter—\nWealth and honor parade in vain.\nI loathe hearing of others’ faults;\nI delight in speaking of others’ goodness.\nWhy hesitate to act?\nWhy take medicine when not dizzy?\nWho says gold and stone are hard?\nTheir hearts, too, can break.\nWho says spirits and gods are divine?\nTheir sincerity, too, can pierce through.\n\n**Six-Word Reciting on a Small Carriage**\nIn days past, riding a carriage was common;\nNow, seeing one ride, they rush in haste.\nSince there are warnings from carriages past,\nHow can there be no caution in treading their tracks?\nBefore setting out, one must drink tea;\nBefore ascending, one must don traveling attire.\nAt the axle’s side, hang volumes of poetry;\nBy the shaft’s end, suspend a jar of wine.\nThe wheels turn slowly to pass fragrant grasses;\nThe canopy lowers to avoid drooping willows.\nBy the water’s edge, one must proceed with care;\nAmid flowers, one must move with composure.\nAt dawn, one often traverses the path of shoes;\nAt dusk, one frequently passes the lane of peace.\nIn deep spring, one gazes upon radiant beauty;\nIn late autumn, one feasts sight on abundant harvests.\nBefore the Tower of Five Phoenixes, the moon’s glow;\nAtop the Tianjin Bridge, the cool breeze.\nIn the Golden Valley Garden, flowing waters;\nBeyond the Wei King’s Embankment, tall bamboos.\nIn stillness, time is most precious;\nIn leisure, the flavor lingers long.\nAll one passes is met with delight;\nAll one sees is free from attachment.\nOne may see farmers grasping their plows;\nOne may see silkworm maidens seeking mulberry.\nOne may see *miwu* covering the fields;\nOne may see caltrops filling the walls.\nOne may see thorns growing dense;\nOne may see orchids and angelica fragrant.\nOne may see chickens, pigs, and dogs at labor;\nOne may see eagles, ospreys, and phoenixes in flight.\nThe harmful are not seen to cause harm;\nThe good are surely not harmed.\nThe three peaks of Mount Hua stand towering;\nThe myriad acres of the Yellow Pool stretch vast.\nIf not to live as a man in vain,\nThen do not squander leisure in Luoyang.\nHaving gained much of Heaven and Earth’s essence,\nWhat harm if Old Man Yaofu departs?\n\n**Reciting on Peace and Joy**\nThe Master of Peace and Joy,\nWithout fame or surname,\nFor thirty years has dwelt\nBy the Luo in Luoyang.\nHis heart holds the wind and moon;\nHis nature, rivers and lakes.\nHe takes flight at the sight of color,\nAlighting only after soaring.\nNo lowly, no poor;\nNo rich, no noble.\nNo sending off, no welcoming;\nNo restraint, no taboo.\nNever troubled by hardship;\nNever drinking to drunkenness.\nHe gathers the world’s spring\nInto his liver and lungs.\nHis pool nurtures his chants;\nHis jar-window invites sleep.\nThe small carriage delights his heart;\nThe great brush quickens his will.\nSometimes he dons a bamboo hat;\nSometimes he wears a half-sleeve.\nSometimes he sits amid the woods;\nSometimes he walks by the water’s edge.\nHe delights in seeing good people;\nHe delights in hearing good deeds.\nHe delights in speaking good words;\nHe delights in acting with good intent.\nHearing of others’ faults,\nIt is as if he bears thorns.\n\nHearing of others’ goodness,\nIt is as if he wears orchids and thoroughwort.\n\nHe neither flatters Chan masters\nNor flatters masters of esoteric arts.\nWithout stepping beyond his gate,\nHe directly reaches heaven and earth.\nNo army can overawe him;\nNo wealth of ten thousand bushels can entice him.\nA joyful man of sixty-five years—\nHis jar-window invites his chants.\n\n**Chant by the Jar-Window**\n\nA guest knows nothing,\nOnly knowing to guard himself.\nIn guarding himself, there is nothing else—\nOnly seeking to avoid fault.\nHe has a few rooms,\nA few acres of fields.\nHe uses a basin as his pool,\nA jar as his window.\nWalls higher than his shoulders,\nA room larger than a peck measure.\nA cloth quilt warms him beyond need,\nA bowl of millet gruel fills him past hunger.\nThe qi he exhales from his chest\nFills the cosmos.\nHis brush falls upon the world,\nIts radiance outshining jade and gem.\nIf one knows contentment,\nRetreat becomes flourishing;\nI never go out—\nWhat retreat could there be?\n\nHis heart harbors no reckless thoughts,\nHis feet take no reckless steps.\nHe makes no reckless friendships,\nAccepts no reckless things.\nFiercely debated,\nHe sweetly endures his humble state.\nLoftily spoken,\nNone surpasses him.\nThe books of the sages never leave his hand;\nThe words of Yao and Shun never leave his lips.\nAmidst harmony and heaven,\nHe delights in easy friendships.\nHe chants poems at ease,\nDrinks joyful wine.\nA hundred years of peace—\nIs this not fortune?\nSeventy years of health—\nIs this not longevity?\n\n**Chant by the Basin Pool**\n\nA guest knows nothing,\nOnly knowing not to act.\nIn not acting, there is nothing else—\nOnly seeking not to deceive.\nI have what others affirm;\nOthers have no fault of mine.\nThus he opens his jar-window,\nAnd so he digs his basin pool.\nUrban land is precious,\nBut rivers and lakes hold wondrous scenes.\nAble to wander marshlands,\nHe need not step from his hall’s foundation.\nGreen grass beyond the curtain,\nYellow banks before the pavilion.\nThe moon sets within his pot,\nClouds fly within his mirror.\nSince there are lotus and water-chestnuts,\nHow could there be no reeds?\nSince there are tadpoles,\nHow could there be no dragons?\nSometimes clear and shallow,\nSometimes vast and boundless.\nSometimes limpid and pure,\nSometimes rippling with waves.\nWind stirs the duckweed,\nCoolness rises in his sleeves.\nWhere is Lin Zong?\nWhere has Fan Li returned?\nDense snow falls softly,\nLight ice spreads thinly.\nWillows droop gently,\nFine rain drifts faintly.\nHere one may find perfection,\nHere one may forget schemes.\nHere one may reflect things,\nHere one may observe the seasons.\nIf not joyful in myself,\nWho else could bring me joy?\nOn this day,\nI meet Fuxi once more.\n\n**Chant of the Small Carriage**\n\nA guest knows nothing,\nOnly knowing he has a home.\nWith a home to return to,\nHis return is not distant.\nHis spirit terrace gleams with stillness,\nHeaven and earth bloom with flowers.\nHe writes with a great brush,\nRides in a small carriage.\nBorn a man\nIn the Central Kingdom,\nAnd dwelling in Luoyang—\nWhat greater fortune could there be?\nAt the center of heaven and earth,\nThe true abode of emperors.\nThe legacy of Han and Tang,\nIts grandeur naturally fine.\nA realm of sages and worthies,\nA deep pool of scholars.\nA field of benevolence and righteousness,\nBoundless in what one hears and sees.\nNeighborhoods press close,\nFriends and kin visit often.\nOthers suspect the sun’s chariot,\nI say it is the stars’ array.\nSometimes he roams Golden Valley,\nSometimes he drifts on Moonlit Waves.\nSometimes he treads the Path of Shoes,\nSometimes he passes Bronze Camels.\nAdvancing and retreating like clouds and water,\nUnfurling and rolling like mist and rosy clouds.\nHe extols the wind and moon,\nLifts and adorns orioles and flowers.\nBy nature he delights in wine,\nDelights in a slight flush from drinking.\nBefore the flush comes,\nHis mouth already chants.\nWhen chanting is not enough,\nHe breaks into a vast song.\nWhen vast song is not enough—\nThere is nothing to be done.\n\n**Chant of the Great Brush**\n\nA guest knows nothing,\nHis nature too unadorned.\nHe neither envies nor seeks,\nNeither clings nor insists.\nHis feet tread the root of heaven,\nHis hands probe the moon’s cave.\nWhat his heart gains,\nHe pours entirely into his brush.\nThoughts distant, emotions fused,\nQi harmonious, spirit at ease.\nWine loosens him to a slight glow,\nSilk spreads half a bolt.\nSwift as the wind’s sudden gust,\nBurgeoning as the clouds’ surge.\nFleeting as lightning’s flash,\nDense as the rain’s fall.\nNow halting, now returning,\nNow vanishing, now appearing.\nIt scours away dust and haze,\nClears the sky and reveals the sun.\nPhoenixes soar,\nDragons and serpents coil.\nSpring blossoms glow bright,\nAutumn mountains stand towering.\nThree thousand scholars in caps and robes\nBow to follow the Confucian way.\nA million warriors in armor\nLook up to heed military discipline.\nPines and cassia form a forest,\nOrchids and irises fill the room.\nSichuan brocade unfurls,\nDawn’s rosy clouds brush past.\nA pair of white jades,\nA hundred measures of gold.\nWang Xizhi comes to seek,\nDu Mu comes to beg.\nSpiritual communion beyond the world,\nWorldly affairs come to an end.\nObservers are startled awake,\nThose who collect it recover faster.\n\n*Yichuan Jirang Ji, Scroll Fourteen*\n*Yichuan Jirang Ji, Scroll Fifteen*\n*Yichuan Shao Yong Yaofu*\n*Observing the Changes, a Chant*\n\n**A Chant on Observing the One**\n\nA single thing comes with a single body,\nWithin that body lies another heaven and earth.\nIf you know all things are complete within me,\nHow could you set the Three Powers apart to root them?\nHeaven from its center divides substance and function—\nOr one might say, the workings of creation.\nHumans weave their plans within the heart.\nHeaven and humanity—how could there be two meanings?\nOr one might say, all affairs.\nThe Dao does not move in vain; it rests in humanity.\n\n---\n\n**A Chant on Observing History**\n\nAlas! The power of four dynasties’ kings\nAll enters this humble, ancient volume.\nSome yielded, some contested—thirty thousand li,\nLinked and transformed across two thousand years.\nWho could continue the deeds of Tang and Yu?\nThe arts of Tang and Wu are lost to the world.\nTimes differ, and so do people—\nHow could Confucius not weep in sorrow?\n\n---\n\n**A Chant on Observing the *Book of Poetry***\n\nTo love one’s lord as in those days is rare,\nYet nothing captures human feeling like poetry.\nWithout the *Ya*, how could royal teachings be clear?\nOnly with the *Feng* can a state’s rise and fall be known.\nNo connoisseur compares to the Lord of Wu,\nAnd even Confucius once polished its lines.\nThree hundred and five poems—all the world’s affairs—\nWho among later men would dare to criticize?\n\n---\n\n**Observing the *Spring and Autumn Annals***\n\nThe august royal house exists in name alone,\nWar never ceases beneath heaven.\nStates are destroyed, men are conquered—none lags behind,\nSeeking alliances, exacting vengeance—never at peace.\nThe decrees of Jin and Qi burn like fire,\nWhile the foundations of Wen and Wu chill like ice.\nOnly the sorrow for the unicorn remains a single heart,\nPreserved for ten thousand years as if in cinnabar.\n\n---\n\n**A Chant on Observing the Three Sovereigns**\n\nHow vast the cosmos—it proclaims itself through me,\nBeyond heaven and earth, what more is there to say?\nAt first, the Great Dao was no ordinary Way,\nJust as there was a time before and after heaven.\nIts methods were so subtle, no trace could be seen,\nIts achievements so enduring, the years were unknown.\nIf the world were to rank meritorious deeds,\nNone could stand before them.\n\n---\n\n**A Chant on Observing the Five Emperors**\n\nWilling to yield or advance the realm,\nWhat words could describe their grace?\nWhere their robes hung, majesty flourished,\nWhen jade and silk were offered, reverence shone.\nEvery thing followed the highest principle,\nEach person willingly achieved great deeds.\nHow did they attain this?\nOnly by their brilliance, like the sun at noon.\n\n---\n\n**A Chant on Observing the Three Kings**\n\nA vast expanse of the Central Plains—over ten thousand *li*—\nHardly a place for the weak to dwell.\nXia and Shang could still proclaim their calendars,\nYet Tang and Wu could not easily wield their weapons.\nThe Fire of Ze received its name and thus transformed,\nBut the Water of Heaven found no response—no need arose.\nThose who take benevolence and righteousness as their heart\nWould never become petty men of the world.\n\n---\n\n**A Chant on Observing the Five Hegemons**\n\nIntent on honoring their names, their names suffered more,\nAs people rushed to obey, exhausted beyond endurance.\nLives were lived amid forests of swords and spears,\nWhile justice and wealth were carried in their hearts.\nThough they could sigh for the lamb and cherish ritual,\nAlas, the phoenix never came to grace them.\nWithin the remaining years of Eastern Zhou’s Five Hegemons,\nOnly Confucius was heard to sigh.\n\n---\n\n**A Chant on Observing the Seven States**\n\nAt their end, they still schemed and maneuvered,\nDeaf to words of benevolence and righteousness.\nWho would have thought Qi could be broken yet Jimo preserved?\nOr that victory at Changping meant burying Zhao’s men alive?\nSeeing ghosts at dawn was no strange thing,\nKilling in broad daylight caused no surprise.\nThen came Su and Zhang, wielding their three-inch tongues,\nGrasping throats so none could live together.\n\n---\n\n**A Chant on Observing the Qin Dynasty**\n\nThe seven states clashed with thunderous might,\nGrinding against one another, never at rest.\nOnly when one lord’s heart was set\nDid the four seas run red with blood.\nThree thousand retainers soon became a dream,\nA hundred and two mountains and rivers turned to autumn.\nBoasting of enfeoffing marquises to guard the land—\nYet Zhao Gao was no marquis at all.\n\n---\n\n**A Chant on Observing the Two Han Dynasties**\n\nThe old battlegrounds of Qin’s broken mountains and rivers—\nWho would have thought the people would farm mulberries again?\nNine thousand *li* of land opened to enfeoffment,\nOver four hundred years bearing the title of emperor.\nAfter ruin came Wang Mang and Dong Zhuo,\nYet none remembered the efforts of Gao and Guang.\nWith such splendor of culture in those days,\nHow could the city walls ever lie in ruins again?\n\n---\n\n**A Chant on Observing the Three Kingdoms**\n\nAwe-inspiring, the tripod’s stand shook like thunder,\nYet its lofty traces are lost to time.\nDrums and flutes in one region left emotions unfulfilled,\nBows and blades across ten thousand *li* strained their strength.\nDebating war with Hengshi—was there no intent?\nWatering horses at the Yellow River—was it all in vain?\nThough one may speak of heaven’s timing, it is also human affairs—\nWho could have known that beyond foresight, fine gold would be lost?\n\n---\n\n**A Chant on Observing the Western Jin**\n\nPeace does not mean there is no worry,\nTo be at ease and forget danger is no good plan.\nRanking men’s talents relied on biting satire,\nJudging the times required a taste for elegance.\nA knife could not cut open the belly of Gonglü,\nNo wood could behead Liu Yuan.\nThe disaster lay in a single line at Evening Sun Pavilion,\nWhile at the Eastern Gate, the waves sighed endlessly.\n\n---\n\n**A Chant on Observing the Sixteen Kingdoms**\n\nBeneath the vast sky, the realm was called the imperial domain,\nWhere Great Yu once governed the aftermath of floods.\nWhen clothes wore out, lice and nits multiplied,\nWhen melons rotted, worms and maggots thrived.\nDragon robes were never meant for mad bandits,\nNor were the standards of court ever raised for rebellious Hu.\nConfucius had words worth pondering—\nIn those days, they lacked a Guan Yiwu.\n\n---\n\n**A Chant on Observing the Northern and Southern Dynasties**\n\nWhen the world was split between north and south,\nEnvoys never ceased their journeys.\nPartial hegemons still upheld ancient laws,\nA fragile peace bore traces of old stench.\nLuoyang’s refined reputation praised Cui Hao,\nThe south’s extraordinary talent admired Xie An.\nFor two hundred and forty years, they rode side by side—\nHow could one casually call them barbarians?\n\n---\n\n**A Chant on Observing the Sui Dynasty**\n\nFrom the start, the plans were flawed,\nAnd those who followed only compounded the harm.\nPeople were as insignificant as ants, coveting land,\nGold and silk as worthless as mud, pleasing concubines.\nThe campaign against Liaodong aimed for the wild frontiers,\nThe canal’s flow expressed weariness with the endless.\nThirty-six years—all swept away.\nHad it not been so, the world would not have returned to Tang.\n\n---\n\n**A Chant on Observing the Tang Dynasty**\n\nHeaven-born, divine, and martial, it settled the center,\nFor without it, the many rebels would not have been quelled.\nWithout the stern winds of the Zhenguan era,\nHow could the Kaiyuan age have known such glory?\nOnly from on high could the grandeur of mountains and rivers be seen,\nOnly in summer could the length of days and months be known.\nFor three hundred years, it unified the realm—\nThough the deeds are past, the Dao shines ever brighter.\n\n---\n\n**A Chant on Observing the Five Dynasties**\n\nSince the Tang’s fall and the collapse of imperial order,\nThe world’s people have suffered turmoil.\nThe altars of state hung on the whims of soldiers,\nThe court’s weight was decided by the clamor of regional lords.\nDeep winter’s cold trees do not shed their leaves,\nThe faint stars before dawn still hold their light.\n\n**A Chant on Observing the Five Dynasties (continued)**\n\nFifty-three years passed under five successive houses—\nOnly then did we know the land awaited a true king.\n\n**A Chant on Witnessing Prosperity**\n\nAmid the chaos of the Five Dynasties’ upheaval,\nSuddenly the clouds parted, and heaven reappeared.\nGrass and trees, bathed in fresh rain and dew for a hundred years,\nWheels and writs now traverse the old mountains and rivers for ten thousand *li*.\nIn ordinary lanes and alleys, officials still don their caps and sashes,\nWhile gardens and pavilions, one after another, resound with pipes and strings.\nThough the people grow old in this age of peace, spring remains young—\nOrioles and blossoms do no harm, even as the sun climbs high and men sleep on.\nWe, who cultivate simplicity, rely on this enlightened age,\nFortunate beyond measure—how could we not know?\nThe realm’s finest talents now retreat into obscurity,\nWhile in this world of fair scenes, brows unfurrow in delight.\nBorn only to know abundance,\nAged without ever enduring chaos or separation.\nFive deeds surpass all previous dynasties—\nEven under Yao, none could match them:\nFirst: On the day of revolution, the markets did not alter their stalls;\nSecond: The conquest of the realm was achieved after ascending the throne;\nThird: Not a single innocent life was taken;\nFourth: At a hundred years, only four reigns;\nFifth: A century without internal strife.\n\n**A Chant on Rejoicing in Old Age**\n\nHow long can these silken temples last?\nWhy trouble with plucking each white hair?\nThough I hold no office in this world,\nI know well the affairs of men.\nWhen spring warms and autumn cools,\nThat is my time to wander east and float west.\nHow many vast and fertile fields lie open—\nOnly now does this old mountain-dweller truly smile.\n\n**A Chant on Paying Homage to Confucius**\n\nWho, holding a scroll, does not read?\nBut how many truly grasp the nature of things?\nHis craft lies within the world’s speech,\nYet his subtlety transcends the carpenter’s line.\nRefining being and non-being—heaven’s work;\nBalancing order and chaos—the emperor’s task.\nGreat indeed is his intent in praising the *Yi* and compiling the Classics—\nSurely none among the people since his time have matched it.\n\n**Returning the Poetry Scroll of Beneficent Master Yi**\n\nMonk’s staff and alms bowl have followed me, wrapped in a single cloth,\nThat cloth once brushed the dust of ten provinces.\nHis mind, long attuned to Buddha-nature, knows no hindrance,\nHis speech, though steeped in Confucian words, remains unforced.\nThe mountains and rivers of Wu and Yue are but yesterday’s affairs,\nWhile the wind and moon of Yi and Song now belong to this body.\nStrolling or sitting idly beneath pine shadows,\nHe must rely on sharp eyes to laugh at the world.\n\n**A Chant on Heaven and Man**\n\nTo know all of human nature—how could heaven differ?\nYet not knowing is as distant as heaven from earth.\nIn youth, the qi is sharp but untried,\nUnwilling to believe the world holds hardship.\nTo know both human nature and heaven’s will—\nSpeak of them as one, and where is the division?\nTo extend one’s own heart to others’ hearts,\nWhat worry remains that the realm cannot be governed?\n\n**A Chant on Spring at Brocade Screen Mountain**\n\nBeneath Brocade Screen Mountain lies my home,\nWhere every year the festival of Cold Food arrives.\nEarly spring’s weather is already fine—\nHow much more so with a master so worthy for a hundred *li*?\nTogether we drink by the same stream,\nDrunk, we sleep beneath ten thousand blossoms.\nTomorrow, the saddle turns eastward—\nThe scenery of Shangyang will be even more radiant.\n\n**A Chant on Delighting in Spring**\n\nOf the four seasons, I love spring best,\nAnd in spring, I love the vernal equinox most.\nWarmth gently nurtures all things,\nNo chill clings to men.\nFine flowers just unfurl their buds,\nExquisite wine is light and mellow.\nA guest in this nest of peace and joy—\nHow could I not grow half-drunk?\n\n**Four Chants on Observing Things**\n\nThe sun and moon shine no differently,\nYet day and night, the moon’s form changes.\nMen and ghosts share the same emotions,\nBut life and death follow different principles.\nIf you cannot know life,\nHow can you know death?\nIf you cannot serve men,\nHow can you serve ghosts?\n\nOrioles and cicadas differ in form—\nWhy trouble yourself with vain words?\nWhen qi is abundant, strength overflows,\nWhen sound fades, it is no different from silence.\nTiming comes by one’s own effort,\nFate departs at another’s will.\nDo not grieve over heart-wrenching matters—\nGrief brings no benefit to the body.\n\nThe passions of past and present are one—\nWho finds it hard to endure?\nDiscerning affairs is no easy task,\nKnowing men is even harder.\nExcessive doubt undermines trust,\nBlind faith loosens vigilance.\nEven Yao and Shun had their flaws—\nHow could they have lacked great villains?\n\nWhat a man’s ears hear\nCannot compare to what his eyes witness.\nEars hear conflicting accounts,\nEyes see no deception.\nTo cast aside ears and eyes,\nRelying solely on the tongue’s debate—\nThis may not achieve the world’s work,\nBut only invite the world’s laughter.\n\n**A Chant on the Value of Spirit**\n\nA man’s worth lies in his spirit,\nYet spirit often lacks purity.\nTo possess spirit and purity—\nThat is the first-rank man.\nWithout purity, there is no principle;\nRight and wrong shift with anger and joy.\nIn anger, right becomes wrong;\nIn joy, wrong becomes right.\nAnger estranges the good,\nJoy aligns with the petty.\nFew are the ruined states and lost families\nNot born of this.\n\nTake a wife for her gentleness,\nMarry a husband for his talent and beauty.\nHow rare the upright woman\nWho matches a true man!\n\n**A Chant on Righteousness and Profit**\n\nNobler than hills and gardens,\nEven meager silks are prized.\nWhen righteousness comes first,\nProfit follows naturally.\nAbandon your sacred tortoise,\nTo gawk at my chewing jaws.\nHaving lost righteousness,\nWhat can profit achieve?\nTo esteem righteousness is to yield—\nThe gentleman’s Way grows.\nTo esteem profit is to contend—\nThe petty man’s Way prevails.\n\n**A Chant on the Small Carriage’s First Outing**\n\nBeyond the world lie thirty-six grotto-heavens,\nAll seemingly arrayed within Luoyang.\nOn days when spring warms and autumn cools,\nA small carriage can move but one palace a day.\n\n**Composed at the Banquet of Prefect Wang Xuanhui**\n\nThe capital’s three-time host, master of the house,\nWhose grand estate and famous gardens crown Luoyang.\nAgain, a new spring falls into his hands—\nTen thousand flowers’ fragrance illuminates the wine cups’ crimson.\nAnother spring has passed in a flurry,\nLeaving only melancholy, drowned in wine’s depth.\nAll the radiant scenes have faded from view—\nOnly before the goblet do I recall old friends.\n\n**A Chant in Late Spring, Replying to a Friend**\n\nAfter a year apart, how do you fare?\nDo not say that being neighbors leaves virtue unaccompanied.\nLuoyang’s spring has already ended in a span of inches—\nDo you still remember our past visits?\n\n**A Chant on Hearing Music at Tianjin Bridge**\n\nFamous gardens stand side by side in Luoyang’s spring,\nLanes and alleys are dust-free, silks and satins renewed.\nWhere is that green tower beyond the peach and plum?\nThe strains of music drift again to Tianjin Bridge.\n\n**A Chant on Late Spring**\n\nWillow catkins, full of intent, vainly imitate snow,\nElm pods, heartless, idly pile like coins.\nPoverty and sorrow cannot bear spring’s betrayal—\nWine-sickness lingers, little changed from last year.\n\n**Two Self-Inquiries**\n\nWhy have I been able to write poetry these past years?\nAlas, the years age, and spring returns again.\nThe wandering oriole cannot bear the flowers’ scattering,\nCrying until dusk, it still cries on.\n\n**Why These Years of Poetry?**\n\nWhy these years of poetry?\nPeach and plum stay silent, but the oriole has words.\nIt cries until dusk and still cries on—\nAlas, the years age, and spring returns again.\n\n**In Response to Commissioner Yu Gongda of Chengdu**\n\nTwo years ago, my carriage passed Tianjin,\nWhere we often raised our cups beneath the flowers.\nNow in this brocade city, blossoms blaze—\nYet how could I recall Luoyang’s spring?\n\n**Two Chants on Wu and Yue**\n\nIn the *yisi* year, Helü humbled Chu;\nIn the *wuchen* year, Goujian crushed Wu.\nHad they seized the moment as of old,\nThirty-four years would have passed unknown.\n\nFu Chai, in the *dingwei* year, imprisoned Yue;\nGoujian, in the *wuchen* year, destroyed Wu.\nTwenty-two years of reversal—\nJust as before, they struck at emptiness.\n\n**A Chant on Duty**\n\nThe wren finds its nest in a single branch,\nNot swayed by sweet words into careless pride.\nEven with strength, crossing the North Sea is hard—\nHow could mere might move a goose feather?\nI wish to express my gratitude clearly,\nNot to squander favor in reckless haste.\nHeaven’s blessings are many, yet fortune fades—\nSpring flowers, though lush, still wither too soon.\n\n**A Chant on Rise and Fall**\n\nSun, Chen, and Li—\nTheir downfalls were alike.\nThough they had some culture,\nWhere was their heroic spirit?\n\nCao, Liu, and Sun—\nTheir rises were alike.\nThough they had some talent,\nWhere was their world-changing destiny?\n\n**A Chant on Civil and Martial Arts**\n\nAs a man of letters,\nOne must also be prepared for war.\nThe Way of civil and martial arts—\nBoth are my family’s affairs.\n\n**A Chant on Good and Evil**\n\nGun had a son,\nWhile Yao and Shun had none.\nWhy do blessings and calamities follow thus?\n\nYao and Shun had no heirs,\nWhile Gun had descendants.\nWhy do fortune favor virtue and disaster strike excess?\n\n**A Chant on Self-Examination**\n\nNot being a perfect man,\nI do not demand perfection in others.\nBut if I were a perfect man,\nI would demand perfection in myself.\n\n**A Chant on Well-Being**\n\nHealth without illness,\nFortune without disaster—\nEven if the whole world enjoyed them,\nThey would not be enough.\n\n**A Chant on Four Things**\n\nWealth, beauty, fame, and power—\nThe world clings to these.\nOnly when unmoved by the four\nCan one truly see others.\n\n**A Chant on Gratitude and Resentment**\n\nIn human nature,\nNothing weighs heavier than death.\nGratitude stirs the heart—\nEven in death, there is joy.\nResentment binds the heart—\nEven in death, it does not end.\nSo deep are gratitude and resentment,\nThey shape a person thus.\n\n**Two Chants on Qin Chuan**\n\nBack then, I rode through Qin Chuan,\nAnd in a flash, twenty years have passed.\nHearing you speak of home,\nI vaguely recall its old mist and haze.\n\nQin Chuan, land of Han emperors,\nNow the eastern passes hold the capital.\nHow many sages and worthies fill the old histories—\nYet in the setting sun, only desolation remains.\n\n**In Response to Prefect Wang Zhongxian of Jiang**\n\nAs a gentleman of Jiang, you bear the bronze tiger tally,\nAnd your poems are no empty boast.\nThe land still bears the grasses and trees of Tang,\nThe mountains and rivers still stir the clouds and mist of Jin.\nYour gardens and ponds overflow with verse,\nThe customs are pure, and lawsuits never reach your hall.\nAs prefect, you bring blessings to the people—\nYour heart never fails the court.\n\n**A Chant on Sun and Moon**\n\nThe moon shines, stars grow sparse;\nThe sun rises, the moon fades.\nIf there was a Shao Zhengmao,\nCould there be no Confucius?\n\n**A Chant on Flood and Drought**\n\nYao endured nine years of floods,\nTang seven years of drought.\nWhere now is the skill of their governance?\n\nNine years of floods,\nSeven years of drought—\nHad it not been for Yao and Tang,\nHalf the people would have perished.\n\n**A Chant on Growing Old**\n\nIf I could turn back ten years,\nI might still accomplish something.\nBut in this world,\nThe sun never returns to noon.\nNow I am sixty-six,\nMy decline beyond compare.\nMy will outstrips my strength—\nAll know this well.\n\n**A Chant on Human Affairs**\n\nNothing is harder to refine than affairs,\nNothing harder to know than people.\nHuman feelings shift with every gesture,\nYet affairs all reach the same end.\n\n**A Chant on Difference**\n\nThe seeker does not obtain,\nThe refuser cannot let go.\nHow far apart are the two?\n\n**A Chant on Greed and Righteousness**\n\nTo covet another’s evil—\nNo greater fault exists.\nTo covet another’s good—\nThis too is a sin.\n\n**A Chant on the New Moon**\n\nThe new moon and the waning moon,\nTheir shapes are much the same.\nYet why does the human heart\nRejoice only at the first sight?\n\n**In Response to Magistrate Li Shifu of Neixiang**\n\nThough not like an immortal,\nYou escape heat and cold.\nHow could there be no streams and bamboos?\nYou never leave the forests and peaks.\nThe Dao differs from new learning,\nTalent alone won’t move high officials.\nYet in times of peace and plenty,\nThere is still joy to spare.\n\nThe year is abundant, the times prosperous,\nAnd your post lies in Nanyang.\nNot neglecting the people’s affairs,\nYou wander among clouds and waters.\nSpring offers peach and plum’s radiance,\nThe wind carries orchid and iris’s fragrance.\nThe prefect is both wise and capable—\nNo need for frantic haste.\n\n**Tianchun Pavilion in Neixiang**\n\nNeixiang has a garden called Tianchun,\nWhere in spring, peach and plum bloom like clouds.\nThe townsfolk bring wine beneath the canopies,\nSinging and dancing in joy.\nThe magistrate remains at ease,\nClaiming no ancient surpassed him.\nA hundred kinds of red and purple peonies—\nGlorious but fruitless, merely flamboyant.\n\n**Jianyin Pavilion in Neixiang**\n\nYour letter of *Jianyin* surprised me,\nAnd at that moment, it stirred me to rise.\n\nThe people are pure, lawsuits rare as in mountain dwellings.\nBeyond ledgers and cups, in leisure between official bonds,\nAmidst talk and laughter, I know not—\nWhich neighboring county could compare?\n\n**Li Shaoqing’s Invitation to Visit and Improvise**\n\nThe Luoyang spring departs, meeting immortals’ talent,\nSpring gone, startled by summer’s sudden arrival.\nA light rain passes, peonies just withered,\nA gentle breeze stirs, herbaceous peonies newly bloomed.\nWithin the shade of green willows, cups and jars abound—\nIn health and prosperous times, how fine to let the heart roam free.\n\n**Chant on Wine-Induced Illness**\n\nYear after year at this time,\nWine-sickness seals the brushwood gate.\nEarly on, people feel much—\nHow bear spring’s return?\nFlowers fade, butterflies flutter in disarray,\nDaylengthens, cuckoos cry.\nHow might one regain those former days,\nWhen the warm breeze first fanned so gently?\n\n**Chant on Contention and Yielding**\n\nWhere yielding exists, can contention be absent?\nWithout continuity, how could renewal arise?\nContention and yielding arise from the heart,\nContinuity and renewal emerge from traces.\nFuxi and Shennong yielded through the Dao,\nYao and Shun yielded through virtue.\nTang and Wu contended through merit,\nHuan and Wen contended through force.\n\n**Xie Wang’s Remembrance in Verse**\n\nBefore and behind the western study, half pines and bamboos,\nMyriad cares settle, only then is truth seen.\nNever did I expect that in this bright and limpid sky,\nYou could still recall old friends and kin.\n\n**Matching Rhymes in Response to Ren Sifeng’s Gift of Verse**\n\nThe nobility of kings and marquises defies description,\nYet in paintings of Zhongshan, one glimpse suffices.\nNot like my lord, who in sitting and walking,\nGreedily admires Songshan, then loves Mount Tiantan more.\nA hundred-foot tower pierces the perilous void,\nSky pale, clouds idle—beholding the emperor’s work.\nAscending one more level, the heart still unsatisfied,\nLonging for you unseen, I see only towering Song.\n\nDeclining the banner, I came here to dwell in cloudy skies,\nHearing you’re well and climbing, how could I dread the toil?\nOn purple paths, affairs abound yet remain unseen—\nMy homeland encircled is none other than lofty Song.\n\n*Yichuan Jirang Ji, Scroll Fifteen Concludes*\n*Yichuan Jirang Ji, Scroll Sixteen*\n\n**Yichuan Shao Yong Yaofu’s Poems in Response**\n\n**In Reply to a Friend’s Poem**\nAre my sinews and bones still as they were in years past?\nDo my qi and blood remain as they were in days of old?\nYet I rejoice in one thing that has grown with time—\nThe skill in talk and laughter before the winecup.\n\n**Chant on the Withering Cold**\nPines and cypresses, seen in winter’s grasp,\nAlone reveal the year’s withering cold.\nTheir sound must be heard amid the wind’s embrace,\nTheir hue best viewed beneath the snow’s mantle.\n\n**Matching Rhymes in Thanks for Ren Sifeng’s Gift of the \"Carefree Pillow\" Poem**\nMy lord bestows upon me a carefree pillow,\nFearing my carefree steps have not yet transcended.\nThough body may wander carefree, it has not yet arrived—\nI must join spirit and dream in carefree flight.\n\n**Chant on Qi and Zheng**\nZichan never shrank from Zheng’s smallness,\nYan Ying never wished Qi’s decline.\nHad these two worthies been born in their rightful place,\nTheir talents would have served as kings’ tutors.\n\n**Poem Sent in Place of a Letter to Lü the Keeper of the Treasury**\nThe Zhou king’s eight steeds raced to the ends of the earth,\nYet how could they compare to the marvel of your four treasures?\nThough Zheng and Luo’s winds and mists lie but a hand’s span away,\nI regret I have no way to journey and behold them.\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Vice Director Wang Anzhi After Rain**\nThe scorching toil of summer’s nine ten-day spans now past,\nA single rain revives all things.\nThe frogs’ drums are not worth hearing,\nThe mosquitoes’ thunder not easily driven off.\nNot only does it ease the year’s provisions,\nBut also settles the officials’ dues.\nFor a wanderer at leisure beneath the trees,\nWhy not delight in this moment?\n\n**Matching Rhymes in Response to Minister He’s Gift**\nI deemed myself unfit for the world’s affairs,\nPassing winter and summer behind barred gates.\nThe path to blue clouds is smooth, yet I rise without merit,\nAmid sparse green bamboo, I find my share of leisure.\nStill, bright flowers reward my simple aspirations,\nAnd fine wine brings a flush to my cheeks.\nLately, the signs of age weigh heavily upon me—\nI fear such gifted talents are not easily matched.\n\n**Chant on Purity and Harmony**\nPure but not harmonious—narrow and full of coarseness.\nHarmonious but not pure—indolent and lacking in propriety.\nTo be both harmonious and pure,\nRighteousness has no fixed form.\nMove when the time is right to move,\nHalt when the time is right to halt.\n\n**Chant on Similarity and Difference**\nBrilliance and swiftness risk fragmentation,\nWeightiness and gravity risk stagnation.\nPursuits follow what one esteems,\nYet cannot escape similarity or difference.\nWhat differs from oneself must be wrong,\nWhat aligns with oneself must be right.\nRight and wrong wage war over similarity and difference,\nAnd one may pass a lifetime without knowing righteousness.\n\n**Chant on the Moment**\nIn life, one seeks to please others;\nIn death, one seeks to please the spirits.\nPleasing others may bring wealth and honor,\nPleasing spirits may avert blame and calamity.\nThough life and death follow different paths,\nAre the principles of men and spirits truly distinct?\nAlas, such overuse of the heart—\nWhen will these vain intentions cease?\n\n**Chant on Observing Things**\nEars sharp, eyes bright—a man’s body,\nEndowed by the great potter’s hand, not born poor.\nOnly by delving into the moon’s cavern can one know things,\nWithout treading the heaven’s root, how can one recognize men?\nWhen Qian meets Xun, observe the moon’s cavern;\nWhere earth meets thunder, behold the heaven’s root.\nRoaming between heaven’s root and the moon’s cavern,\nAll thirty-six palaces bloom with spring.\n\nThe simple and honest lack keen insight,\nThe keenly insightful lack careful discernment.\nHow might one find both simplicity and keen insight,\nTo speak with them of the world’s affairs?\n\n**Chant Over Wine**\nWith wine, I often raise a cup,\nNow nearing seventy, what more do I seek?\nTeeth failing, marriages and betrothals not yet settled,\nYears of drought, fields yielding but a meager harvest.\nGuests depart, and at times I fold my hands in leisure,\nThe sun high, with nothing to do, I quietly comb my hair.\nFrost-touched locks do more than adorn poetic scenes—\nThey may yet serve as subjects for a painter’s brush.\n\n**Chant on Autumn Thoughts**\nA season of spring has barely passed,\nWhen geese from beyond the clouds announce their return.\nThe turning of seasons comes before my eyes like this,\nWhile the years slip from my head thus.\nThough the ambitions of youth remain,\nHow can these sinews and bones not weaken?\nYet I rely on this inch of heart, ever glad—\nEven the sages’ hardest truths I can comprehend.\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Vice Director Wang Anzhi on an Autumn Outing**\nSpring and summer have come and gone, fit for poetry,\nYet though fit for poetry, what use is it?\nOften empty like Yanzi,\nYet far from matching Huizi in traversing things.\nThe mood of wind and moon is beyond bearing,\nThe sentiment of clouds and mountains cannot be contained.\nA song, a chant—let us exchange verses,\nDaring to match Anzhi and Jingzhi.\n\n*Zhang Shaoqing Tuan, styled Jingzhi.*\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Wang Anzhi on Attending the Autumn Gathering of Prefect Wang Xuanhui at the Luo Society**\nFrom the inner chambers, guests and kin emerge,\nMusic played to new melodies, divinely inspired.\nWhen red candles burn bright, sleeves of green flutter,\nWhere painted oars pause, green duckweed is claimed.\nOnce a visitor to the golden halls of early years,\nNow one soon to depart the Phoenix Pool.\nYour estate crowns the capital, called \"Snail’s Retreat\"—\nHow dare Shao Yaofu presume to be your western neighbor?\n\n**Poem Expressing Shame for Failing the Three Appointments at Heyang, Heqing, and Jiyuan**\nAutumn rains linger, the mud slick and deep,\nDay after day, when will the skies clear?\nDear friends long for my arrival,\nYet my frail frame, averse to cold, cannot journey far.\nThough the distance is not great,\nTwice I set out, twice failed to fulfill the promise.\nTwo matters war within my breast,\nLeaning on my desk, I sit in sorrow, finding no peace.\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Vice Director Wang Anzhi’s Poem on an Autumn Engagement**\nRise and fall—why debate such things?\nIn the end, all matters even out.\nA patch of fleabane and mugwort,\nA body of clouds and waters for a thousand years.\nThe harvest comes at just the right time,\nThe cold and warmth of qi begin to balance.\nFrom now on, let our meetings bring joy—\nGentlemen, do not weary of their frequency.\n\n**Poem to My Eldest Son, Bowen, on His Failure in the Examinations**\nWhat the Confucians esteem\nAre conduct and righteousness, and literary composition.\nSuccess or failure is never certain,\nFlourishing or withering not easily measured.\nStriving must be diligent,\nGain and loss are the common lot.\nExternal things cannot be relied upon—\nHis words carry a profound flavor.\n\n**Year’s End Poem to Myself**\nThe Way of Heaven has no eternal spring,\nThe Way of Earth no constant treasure.\nOnly those who receive the harmonious qi of the mean\nCan become men of pure excellence.\nGood fields yield abundant millet,\nPoor soil suffices for brambles and thorns.\nThe ailanthus and mugwort,\nAre fit only to serve as kindling.\nThough born as the spirit of the myriad things,\nOne must possess their essence.\nWithout the spirit of the myriad things,\nOne is but a mere part of their kind.\nTo utter the rarest words,\nOne must harbor the rarest intent.\nTo manifest the fairest name,\nOne must perform the fairest deeds.\nAiding the times is a fair deed,\nEnlightening the lord is a rare intent.\nAlas, of these two,\nI alone possess neither.\n\n**Chant on a Gentleman’s Wine-Drinking**\nFather kind, son filial,\nElder brother friendly, younger brother respectful.\nHousehold well-provided, people content,\nTimes harmonious, years abundant.\n\n**On Physical Well-Being**\nSinews and bones hale and hearty, neighbors and kin in frequent visit.\nA gentleman drinks his wine—\nHis joy knows no bounds.\n\n**Chant on Reading the Biography of Zhang Zifang**\nFirst merit in founding the Han house,\nHow fine to begin well and end well!\nOne might suspect the later Red Pine Master\nWas none other than the Yellow Stone Elder of old.\nUse or retirement follows the times without fixed bounds,\nConcealment or action rests with me—now blocked, now free.\nThe ancients are dead and gone, never to be seen again,\nHow grievous that few today keep such a spirit!\n\n**Two Chants on Observing Things (Xining Ninth Year)**\nThe willow’s nature is most supple,\nIn one year it grows over a yard tall.\nThough easily flourishing,\nAlas, how easily withered!\nAll grains look up to the life-giving rain,\nThe driest stalks turn most lush.\nHow might this sweet moisture be had,\nTo briefly revive all living things?\n\n**Five Chants on Order and Chaos**\nDisorder outnumbers order,\nHarm outnumbers benefit,\nSorrow outnumbers joy,\nUgliness outnumbers beauty.\nOne yin, one yang—\nWhy must it be thus?\nThe Central Plains, a stretch of idle fields,\nOnce bore the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors.\nThe Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors had many descendants,\nSome base, some poor, some rich, some noble.\nRefining principle to the divine for practical use—\n\"Practical use\" means entering and exiting the numinous.\nThe numinous has no fixed form, the *Changes* no fixed body,\nHidden in function, manifest in benevolence.\n\n**Fire and Water**\nFire can overcome water,\nFire cannot overcome water—then the fire is extinguished.\nWater can follow fire,\nWater cannot follow fire—then the water stays cold.\n\n**Husband and Wife**\nA husband can restrain his wife,\nA husband cannot restrain his wife—then the wife turns away.\nA wife can follow her husband,\nA wife cannot follow her husband—then the wife becomes perverse.\n\n**Heaven and Earth**\nHeaven can generate but cannot nurture,\nEarth can nurture but cannot generate.\nFire can cook but cannot moisten,\nWater can moisten but cannot cook.\nEven heaven and earth lack perfect efficacy,\nHow could water and fire possess perfect power?\nWhen the two attain their use and nourish each other,\nThey turn instead to oppress each other.\n\n**Thirty-Year Chant**\nCompared to thirty years ago,\nToday is hardship.\nCompared to thirty years hence,\nToday is ease.\nWhen order lasts long, people long for chaos,\nWhen chaos lasts long, people long for order.\nHow might one obtain a thousand-year crane,\nTo ride away and wander the immortal mountains?\n\n**Chant on Illness**\nWhen the body is ill, one seeks medicine and physician;\nIf the medicine is not good, the body must suffer.\nWhen the state is ill, one seeks men to heal it;\nIf the men are not good, the state must be imperiled.\nWhen matters are not yet urgent, swiftly change course;\nWhen matters have grown urgent, though one repent, it is hard to recover.\n\n**Chant Before the Flowers**\nThis year’s flowers bloom as they did last year,\nToday’s man opens them with yesterday’s heart.\nTroubles are wholly absent—half a pinch,\nJoys are ever present—a hundred cartloads.\nTime has passed, but the mind has not,\nTeeth and hair may wither, but the will has not.\nWhen asked if Master Yao Fu has gone out,\nI reply: \"Just now from the grotto-heaven.\"\n\n**Self-Description**\nWarm in spring, cool in autumn, half-drunk,\nLeisurely riding a slow carriage, a dust whisk in hand.\nThough I lack great virtue to aid the living,\nI at least adorn the scene of this era of peace.\n\n**Chant on Departing Office**\nWhen a gentleman departs his office,\nThe people are left with lingering blessings.\nWhen a petty man departs his office,\nThe people are left with lingering misfortune.\n\n**Chant with Staff in Hand**\nStaff in hand, now in the southern garden, now in the northern,\nSpring’s arrival brings especial comfort to declining years.\nAfter the first clear weather following the Lantern Festival,\nJust warming winds before the Cold Food Day.\nThe pond’s banks lightly adorned with tender grass,\nThe forest’s treetops faintly veiled in thin mist.\nAt this moment, how generous is the Lord of Spring—\nIn the midst of the formless, he fashions beauty.\n\n**Chant of No Wishes**\nI wish not for the court to appoint me an office,\nNor for the court to bestow upon me grain and silk.\nI only wish the court would reduce corvée labor,\nThat the world might enjoy a little rest.\n\n**Chant on Measuring One’s Strength**\nAct according to your strength, and you will have no regrets;\nFind joy where you may, and curb your striving.\nYou may seek a fine steed to ride,\nBut fear that all your life you will have no horse at all.\n\n**Playful Reply to a Friend’s Chant**\nWho is this Shao Yaofu?\nYear after year, spring and autumn, he comes to call on you.\nHis carriage, in half a year, makes but one turn—\nNot like a swift horse kicking up fragrant dust.\n\n**Occasional Chant**\nGaoyao met Shun,\nYi Yin encountered Tang,\nWuding found Fu Yue,\nKing Wen gained Jiang Yuan,\nQi knew Guan Zhong,\nHan recognized Zhang Liang,\nZhuge Liang opened Shu,\nXuandi inaugurated Tang.\n\n**Chant on Observing Affairs**\nA year’s affairs are diligent in spring,\nA day’s affairs are diligent at dawn.\nA life’s affairs are diligent in youth,\nA single task’s affairs are diligent when new.\n\n**Chant on Observing Things**\nWhen profit is light, principle is weighty;\nWhen profit is weighty, principle is light.\nIf profit cannot overcome principle,\nSincerity naturally abounds.\nIf principle cannot overcome profit,\nStrife and anger naturally abound.\n\n**Chant on Gold and Jade**\nThe sage emerges from among men,\nThe heart is cultivated through conduct.\nGold is found within the sand,\nJade is sought within the stone.\n\n**Chant on Wind and Frost**\nGrass bends before the wind,\nGrass withers before the frost.\nThe pine sings before the wind,\nThe pine stands firm before the frost.\nTo bend before the wind, to wither before the frost—\nHow can one be said to exist or perish?\n\n**Chant on High and Low**\nFrom below, looking up—\nBoundless wealth and honor.\nFrom above, looking down—\nBoundless baseness and poverty.\nFrom the mind, observing things—\nWhat thing can be one?\nFrom things, observing the mind—\nWhat mind is not equal?\n\n**Chant on My Five-Roomed Hut**\nThough my hut is small, it roughly shelters me,\nAt least sparing me the shame of renting another’s lodging.\nMany in this world have no house to live in,\nBegging warmth beneath another’s eaves.\n\n**Returning from Viewing Apricot Blossoms by the Chan River**\nEast of the Chan River, apricot blossoms open,\nBeyond the flowers, by Tianjin Bridge, I turn back at dusk.\nI pluck an apricot blossom to wear in my hair,\nTo let others know I’ve come to see the flowers.\n\n**Chant on Taking a Wife**\nWhen a man takes a wife,\nLet her have beauty, virtue, dignity, and bearing.\nShould she bear a son,\nLet him be a Gao Yao or a Kui.\n\n**Chant on Good Deeds**\nGood deeds are surely hard to force,\nWorthy men must be sought with heart.\nThe floating life of sun and moon is not long—\nOnce time passes, a thousand regrets, ten thousand regrets.\n\n**Chant of No Return**\nSpring does not come again,\nFlowers do not bloom again.\nMan does not grow young again,\nTime does not return again.\n\n**Chant on the Hair-Cutting**\nWho shears the hair to thank Lu Chen’s sinking?\nThe flesh and bones of the living cannot endure such encroachment.\n\n**Chant of Turning the Sky**\nIn the human realm lies the power to turn the heavens,\nYet in the groves, many harbor hearts that grieve for the nation.\nThe sun passes its zenith, yet sorrow knows no end;\nThe moon nears its fullness, yet peril runs deep.\nIn the army, the scholar’s robes are my family’s way—\nWhere now to seek the Lord of Martial Might, Zhuge?\nA heart that grieves for the nation does so out of love for the lord;\nTo love the lord, one must hold him dearer than oneself.\nWhat the mouth preaches may not be true—\nOnly what the hands accomplish is real.\nWhen vain thoughts stir, the mirror fails to reflect;\nIn the depths of worldly bias, no man is known.\nTo slander the world as utterly wicked is the gravest calumny—\nHow many heroes lie buried in the dust below?\n\n**Six Attainments Chant**\nThe eye can discern,\nThe ear can hear,\nThe mouth can speak,\nThe hand can act,\nThe body can move,\nThe heart can let go.\nWhen all six are mastered,\nOne’s virtue aligns with Heaven and Earth.\nIn eating and rising, in going and staying,\nIn speech and silence—\nNot only is the mind at ease,\nBut effort is spared as well.\n\n**Chant of Rise and Fall**\nWhen power is at its height, one lifts their head in arrogance;\nWhen qi wanes, they turn on their heel to sigh in despair.\nTo slander the world as full of worthies—\nHow could the world ever be so falsely maligned?\n\n**Chant of Wealth and Nobility**\nGreat Shun shared the likes and dislikes of the people,\nThus following their desires to bring them peace.\nTo know that wealth and nobility are but ordinary things—\nHe who is made proud by wealth and nobility is no true man.\n\n**Chant of No Delusion**\nLet the ear hear no falsehood,\nThe eye gaze upon no vanity,\nThe mouth speak no idle words,\nThe heart harbor no reckless thoughts.\nWhen these four are free of delusion,\nThey become the tools of sages and worthies.\nWho am I, that I dare not aspire to emulate them?\n\n**Chant of Good and Evil**\nIf one does not pursue goodness in others nor rid oneself of evil,\nTo claim knowledge of the Dao—is this not difficult indeed?\n\n**Chant of a Spring Day in the Garden**\nSpring’s warmth invites a stroll through the garden—nothing unusual,\nYet within this realm, it differs little from the land of immortals.\nDaily among the bamboo, I keep company with true friends;\nBy the waterside, we often raise cups of wine.\nAfter rain, birdsong flits through the trees;\nBefore the wind, the fragrance of flowers assails the senses.\nAmid the groves, wealth and nobility bring the same joy—\nLet them come freely, for there is no harm in it.\n\n**Chant of Interpreting Words**\nMan’s words are trust,\nThe sun and moon are brightness.\n\n**On the Character \"武\"**\n\"武\" is made by halting the spear—peace through strength;\n\"羹\" is made with lamb’s flesh—harmony in the pot.\n\n**Chant of Reflection on Affairs**\nOrchids planted yet fail to flourish,\nThorns carved yet refuse to vanish.\nHelpless before these two,\nI linger as the year nears its close.\n\n**Chant of Adversity and Success**\nAdversity cannot bend me,\nSuccess cannot make me lax.\nTo claim knowledge of the Dao—is this not difficult indeed?\n\n**Chant of the Cosmos**\nThe cosmos rests within my hand,\nAll things dwell within my frame.\nVast and unceasing as if present,\nHow could their use ever weary?\n\n**Chant of Prolonged Drought**\nAfter long drought, we yearn for rain;\nAfter long rain, we long for sun.\nSuch is the constant Way of Heaven,\nSuch is the nature of man.\n\n**Chant of Cultivating Nature**\nCultivate nature, let it endure;\nFocus the will, let it not divide.\nWhat fear then remains\nOf falling short of the ancients?\n\n**Chant of Paths**\nThe path before me need not be narrow—\nWhen paths grow narrow, no travelers pass.\nWhen travelers cease, paths turn to waste,\nAnd the world is mostly brambles and thorns.\n\n**Chant of the Great Man**\nThe Way of Heaven is distant,\nThe way of man is near.\nFulfill human sentiment,\nAlign with Heaven’s principle.\n\n**Chant of the Primordial (For Xing He-Shu)**\nA single expanse of the primordial, called the Great Void,\nIn its quiescence, reveals true richness.\nWho would flaunt the treasures within their breast?\nThe world’s finest talents suffer grave slander.\nWhen principle flows smoothly, all words may be released;\nWhere righteousness finds rest, what place cannot be home?\nOnly after the cosmos settles in tranquility\nDoes one truly believe that heroes walk among men.\n\n**Chant of Reflection on Affairs**\nIn doing good, measure your strength and portion;\nDiscerning opportunity lies in understanding human nature.\nWhen human nature is exhausted, doubts become insurmountable;\nWhen strength is measured, affairs naturally find balance.\nWhere principle flows, all before you is a path;\nWhere righteousness falters, thorns block the gate.\nWho would heed these words?\nYet these words are clear—why do men not listen?\n\n**Chant of the Great Song**\nWhat is called discerning opportunity?\nOnly the divine can fathom the subtle.\nAction and stillness rest entirely with me;\nUse and rejection depend on the times.\nEver do I regret recognizing men too late,\nEver do I worry perceiving affairs too slowly.\nOnly when one becomes one with Heaven\nDoes one truly know the wisdom of Confucius.\n\n**Chant of Fame and Gain**\nFame and gain never enter my breast,\nThus my breast’s qi surges freely.\nBoth love and hate are maladies—\nWhen shall my spirit terrace find repose?\n\n**Chant from On High**\nWho transforms cruel poisons of a thousand kinds\nInto a single stream of gracious light?\nMourning that the ancients are no more,\nI lean on high and sigh deeply.\n\n**Chant of Intent Fulfilled**\nIntent is fulfilled in things,\nWords are fulfilled in sincerity.\nTo feign emotion and dominate things—\nThis is not within my power.\n\n**Two More Chants of the Great Song**\nSorrow and joy,\nA hair’s breadth apart.\nOrder and chaos differ in form,\nYet mountains and rivers remain unchanged.\nThe sound of a flute drifts from afar;\nGrasses and trees appear in the distance.\nFrom some lofty tower,\nA man leans on the railing as the sun sets.\n\nFine virtue is hard to find—\nWise one, it is best to desist.\nTreading frost may yet be remedied;\nFelling trees—what more is there to seek?\nBeasts, when trapped, await another day;\nGeese, when they fly, depart with autumn’s end.\nWhen the people hunger, they must be fed—\nBeyond feeding, all is but idle thought.\n\n**Chant of Gentleness and Kindness**\nThe gentleman’s gentleness and kindness demand scrutiny;\nThe petty man’s deceit and falsity must also be known.\nStartled by the world’s treacherous schemes,\nI find the days and months within my gourd pass slowly.\n\n**Chant of the Gentleman**\nThe gentleman aligns with righteousness,\nThe petty man with profit.\nAligned with righteousness, he daily rises;\nAligned with profit, he daily declines.\nThe gentleman values virtue,\nThe petty man values force.\nValuing virtue plants kindness;\nValuing force plants enmity.\nThe gentleman creates blessings,\nThe petty man wields power.\nCreating blessings brings blessings;\nWielding power brings calamity.\nThe gentleman delights in goodness,\nThe petty man delights in evil.\nDelighting in evil invites evil;\nDelighting in goodness invites goodness.\nThe gentleman seeks praise,\nThe petty man seeks slander.\nSeeking slander provokes anger;\nSeeking praise brings joy.\nThe gentleman thinks of prosperity,\nThe petty man thinks of ruin.\nThinking of prosperity summons fortune;\nThinking of ruin summons misfortune.\nThe gentleman delights in giving,\nThe petty man delights in demanding.\nDelighting in giving brings much joy;\nDelighting in demanding brings much sorrow.\nThe gentleman delights in life,\nThe petty man delights in killing.\nDelighting in life, the Way flourishes;\nDelighting in killing, the Way perishes.\n\n**Chant of the Primordial**\nBefore Heaven, do not oppose it;\nAfter Heaven, follow its seasons.\nNot opposing never falters;\nFollowing seasons sometimes wearies.\n\n**Chant of Refreshment**\nFew are the flavors that refresh the palate;\nFew are the deeds that refresh the heart;\nFew are the words that refresh the mind;\nFew are the acts that refresh the body.\n\n**Chant of Utmost Sincerity**\nSeeking little, thus one attains;\nDeparting not from learning, thus one is enlightened.\nTo keep the heart ever bright,\nNothing surpasses utmost sincerity.\n\n**Chant of Recording Events**\nOther mountains’ stones can polish jade—\nBefore the jade is fully wrought, age hastens me.\nBounded time slips away with each affair;\nUnbounded decay follows man’s steps.\nA thousand poems refine temperament and nature;\nA cup of wine harmonizes sinew and bone.\nSixty-six years without a day of leisure—\nOnly now does my heart’s source begin to shine.\n\n**In Reply to Scholar Ning’s Request for Poems**\nIdle words beneath the pines—\nWhy need there be so many?\nThree hundred poems or so\nAre enough for chanting and recitation.\n\n**Chant of Poetry and Wine**\nThe Sage’s words are hard to convey—\nHow could they last but a thousand or ten thousand years?\nOnly with a tranquil heart can one know the bright sun;\nOnly with clear eyes can one see the azure sky.\nGhosts and spirits’ forms are written in poetry;\nCreation’s work is passed down through wine.\nWithout poetry and wine, these matters would not be conveyed—\nAnd without poetry and wine, how could they be spoken?\n\n**Chant of the White-Haired**\nWho does not grow white-haired?\nMy whiteness comes not from sorrow.\nOnly because men are full of desires—\nHow can I be like them, untroubled?\nUntroubled because I do not stir;\nFull of desires because I seek much.\nAging is the common lot of men—\nHow could one not grow white-haired?\n\n**Chant of the True Listener**\nOnly Confucius could speak of having no intent;\nOnly Mencius could speak of an unshaken heart.\nSeek not white jade in the mountains—\nFind yellow gold within yourself.\nWhite jade in the mountains may sometimes be found;\nYellow gold within oneself is nowhere to be sought.\nWho are we to dare claim understanding?\nHow can we know there are no true listeners in the world?\n\n*Yichuan Jirang Ji, Volume Sixteen Concludes*\n*Yichuan Jirang Ji, Volume Seventeen*\n\n**Chant of Humanity and Things**\nMan broken must be mended,\nThings broken must be repaired.\nYet mending and repairing, though many,\nEnd only in exposure and ruin.\nMan has man’s sentiments,\nThings have things’ principles.\nThough man and things differ in kind,\nHow can sentiments and principles be distinct?\n\n**Chance Encounter Chant**\nIn the woods, with nothing to occupy the heart,\nI nap through the day, rewarded with a cup of wine.\nThe lingering dream cannot be fully recalled—\nHalf drifts with wind and rain down the eastern street.\n\n**Contemplating Things Chant**\nWith the first division of qi,\nThe Two Modes are already complete.\nThe round is Heaven,\nThe square is Earth.\nTransformation gives rise to life,\nMovement and stillness bring forth kinds.\nMan stands between them,\nMost numinous, most noble.\n\n**Warring States Chant**\nIn the time of the Seven States, war was prized;\nMight and cunning, deceit and force, all flourished together.\nLian Po and Bai Qi excelled in command,\nSu Qin and Zhang Yi in stratagem.\nAt dawn a commoner, by dusk a lord—\nYesterday feasting from the tripod, today cooked within it.\nFan Sui, dismissed from office—what was his heart?\nCai Ze, entering Qin—on what did he rely?\nThe First Emperor roused his sleeves, and the world was pacified;\nThe Second begged to be a mere clod of earth, yet could not.\nThree thousand retainers’ resentment was not yet spent,\nWhen the hundred and two rivers of Qin gave way to Han.\nOf all that remained, only empty names—\nThe fading sun, withered grass, the shapes of mountains and streams.\nIt all passed like a spring dream;\nWhat more need be said of might and ferocity?\n\n**Stirred by Events Chant**\nA sword that cuts jade like mud is no idle boast—\nWho knows that in this world there is Kunwu steel?\nTo speak well is not yet to be a true man;\nOnly he who acts rightly deserves the name of great man.\nTo grow old among woods and springs is my true wish,\nYet the people fill the ditches—what guilt is theirs?\nThough it is not my affair, my heart aches;\nI cherish this scroll of Fuxi’s ancient script.\n\n**Five Further Chants**\nAll things possess their essence,\nMan is the spirit of all things.\nFirst examine the nature of affairs,\nThen discuss the sentiments of men.\nWhen qi is tranquil, the form is at ease and joyful;\nWhen the heart is idle, the body is at great peace.\nWhen the Lord of Yi and Qi governed the world,\nThey did not go beyond this principle of life.\n\nUsing medicine is like waging war—\nWhen war is waged, can there be peace?\nSeeking peace, peace is not attained;\nBanishing illness, illness returns.\nDecoctions do not fully restore,\nWhile rich foods only provoke strife.\nHow then may one attain long life?\nThe auspicious sign of the Old Man Star.\n\nAll things turn on the Dao as their pivot,\nYet their origins differ in kind.\nThough their natures are neither thick nor thin,\nTheir principles vary in refinement and coarseness.\nNothing compares to man in splendor—\nYet know that things, too, have their abundance.\nBorn in this age,\nI am fortunate not to be a common man.\n\nI have heard, but hearing is not like seeing;\nI have seen, but seeing is not like experiencing.\nHaving applied the heart to experience,\nWhy trouble the mouth with words and deeds?\nRevising poetry, one knows the transforming power of the brush;\nSobering from wine, one recognizes the harmony of the broth.\nI reckon the affairs of men—\nNone escape this sentiment.\n\nBefore us lie a hundred million years,\nAfter us, a hundred million ages.\nBetween them, the long-lived man\nScarcely reaches a hundred.\nFrom his mouth come no good words,\nIn his conduct, no good deeds.\nHe merely possesses the form of man,\nYet lacks man’s true nobility.\n\n**Treading the Dao Chant**\nWhat age has lacked men to raise the radiance of virtue?\nToday, the many worthies gather in the western capital.\nThe flourishing of culture and refinement in this time of peace\nSurpasses even the full splendor of the Yuanhe era.\n\n**Seeing Right Action Chant**\nWhen one sees what is right, one must act;\nWhen one does not see, then let it be.\n\n**Measuring Strength Chant**\nAct according to one’s strength; cease when strength is spent.\n\n**Observing Things Chant**\nLike the luan or phoenix, their bearing serene—\nThose born thus are loyal or good.\nLike the rat or sparrow, their bearing skittish—\nThose born thus are wicked or cruel.\n\n**Nobles Chant**\nNobles and great men, the world looks to them;\nCareless habits spread, grave harm to their dignity.\nThis alone unfinished, how can they attend to that?\nNot for lack of the Dao, but for the rise of greed again.\nTopped with a scholar’s cap, their hearts hold Buddhist signs.\nThey sought peace of mind, yet stir their minds to noise.\nLike raising a child—one should seek resemblance,\nYet teach not virtue, but theft instead.\n\n**Self-Reflection Chant**\nOld age comes with no achievement, teeth and hair decline,\nNear seventy years—what is there left to do?\nAt home, no illness, no need for medicine;\nNow and then, moved by feeling, I still write poems.\nDrawing water, I delight as fish gather near;\nPlucking flowers, I rejoice as butterflies follow.\nA lifetime of learning yields no other fruit—\nOnly this: my heart is free of turmoil.\n\n**Observing Things Chant**\nThe painter depicts things over months and years;\nThe mirror reflects them instantly before us.\nThe mirror’s clarity may yet lack precision;\nThe craftsman’s hand may render unevenness.\nOf all things level in the world, none compares to water.\nIt reflects the surface but not what lies within.\nTo see both surface and depth—only the sage.\nScrutinizing words and deeds, nothing escapes truth.\nFulfilling the nature of things, shedding one’s own feelings—\nThe virtuous must speak;\nThose who speak may not act.\n\n**Sleeplessness Chant**\nGreat shock brings no sleep, great sorrow no sleep,\nGreat grief no sleep, great illness no sleep,\nGreat joy no sleep—only great peace brings sleep.\nWhy no sleep? Entangled in cares.\nWhy sleep? Free of affairs.\n\n**Two Zhegu Chants**\nIn the world, gold is prized above all—\nWho says gold cannot be found?\nWithout idle words or refined intent,\nWhat else can gladden a good heart?\nDistant mountains on all sides offer pure freshness,\nHidden birds in a thousand songs send sweet sounds.\nThough boundless spring has faded away,\nPray, listen to the zhegu’s cry.\n\nDeep in emerald bamboo groves, the zhegu calls,\nIts voice more stirring than the wine-pourer’s song.\nNorth and south of the river, they ever follow,\nAfter spring, before spring, they call of their own accord.\nExiled officials, hearts broken, startle from dreams;\nTraveling soldiers, tears soak their collars.\nHearing it in sorrow, the bowels first sever—\nCan such grief be endured?\n\n**Primordial Chant**\nIf asked of the Primordial—there is not a single word;\nOnly in the Later Heaven does effort begin.\nBoasting strength to move mountains and overshadow the age—\nAt this, can one force even a hair’s worth?\n\n**Self-Joy Chant**\nThe qilin and phoenix have never left the wilds;\nIn times of peace, why fret and clamor?\nHearing of good deeds, my heart rejoices first;\nSeeing rare books, my hands copy them myself.\nBeneath bamboo, a tile’s worth of clear spring flows;\nAtop pines, two rods of red sun rise.\nAwake in my nest, I sit before it—\nHow could idle words dispel guests’ mockery?\n\n**People’s Sentiments Chant**\nWhen the people’s hearts are joyful, harmonious qi brings blessings.\nWhen the people’s hearts are troubled, harsh qi brings calamity.\nBlessings are like rain and dew—all under heaven prospers.\nCalamity is like flood and drought—all under heaven suffers famine.\n\n**Peony Chant**\nThe peony’s grace outshines all flowers,\nAnd among them, some are kings.\nFour hues transform into a hundred,\nA hundred hues, a hundred fragrances.\n\n**Letter in Verse Chant**\nGold must be smelted a hundred times to know its purity;\nHow can a water-mirror compare to a man’s discernment?\nNot discarding old friends, one preserves them;\nHow dare one forget lifelong bonds?\nAffairs of state demand practical words;\nThe Dao and virtue rest on sincerity alone.\nBefore the myriad grasses and trees,\nOnly the pine and cassia stay green through the cold.\n\n**Minor Illness Chant**\nWhen illness is slight, none suspect it;\nWhen it deepens, medicine cannot cure.\nThrough diligence and humility, one ends well;\nThrough confusion and relapse, great loss follows.\nBetween self and things, no room for a hair’s breadth;\nBetween heaven and man, how can a thread intrude?\nKnowing ancient joy is like present joy—\nHow many needless words are spared?\n\n**Borrowed Poems**\nPoems wild, books unconstrained—\nIn recent years, they’ve multiplied beyond count.\nMost have scattered across the world,\nUnreturned to the Nest of Peace.\n\n**Effortless Chant**\nIn life, no forced verses,\nNo striving for depth in brush or ink.\nThe brush moves as the nature flows;\nThe poem forms to express the heart.\nPoetry soars with the heart’s creativity,\nThe brush blooms like a garden of the mind.\nWhat I delight in is my own delight—\nDelight without excess.\n\n**Myriad Things Chant**\nAll things are complete within oneself;\nHeaven and earth do not fail man.\nTime slips away like grass in the wind;\nAffairs fall into routine.\nGrieving that youth fades,\nStartled by new white hairs.\nIf the heart holds nothing,\nOne becomes but dust—or flees like dust.\n\n**Moon’s Hollow Chant**\nThe Moon’s Hollow and Heaven’s Root,\nBetween them, frequent comings and goings.\nWherever one dwells, all is ample;\nWherever one goes, all is at ease.\nEach step finds its place;\nThe heart is full of spring.\nWithout poetry and wine,\nHow greatly one would be diminished!\n\n**Great Image Chant**\nThe Great Image is empty at its core,\nIts emptiness truly unchanging.\nIn action, it is the heart’s work;\nIn response, the mouth’s skill.\nRelying on capacity, a thousand things exist;\nWith a single care, none remain.\nWho knows this principle\nOutweighs reading five cartloads of books.\n\n**Hundred Ills Chant**\nA hundred ills arise from feeling;\nLight feeling, light illness.\nCan one be without attachments?\nYet there is always something to rely on.\nAutumn moon, a thousand mountains still;\nSpring blossoms, ten thousand trees flourish.\nIf speaking of true work,\nHuman effort cannot contrive it.\n\n**Small Cart Chant**\nSpring’s warmth not yet oppressive,\nAutumn’s chill not yet severe.\nThe small cart follows whim;\nWherever it goes, joy arises.\n\n**Striking the Earth Chant**\nThree thousand poems of *Striking the Earth*,\nTwelve households of *Moving Nests*.\nTaking joy as one’s work,\nCultivating the will as one’s livelihood.\nComing and going as one pleases,\nVisiting in a small cart.\nWho knows this joy\nNeeds not wait for splendor?\n\n**Two Poems Left at the Northern Waters of Yang, Gentleman of the Bureau’s Garden and Pavilion**\nSince ancient times, buying a dwelling has prized the sight of mountains—\nHow much does it cost to see mountains today?\n\nPeaks of wonder encircle afar, parted by waters,\nTowering trees loom low, lightly veiled in mist.\nTravelers on the road suspect they pass through immortal grottoes,\nThose leaning on railings fear they’ve become transcendent beings.\n\nEver dreading unseen entry into a painter’s hand,\nTo be rendered on silk and spread through the world.\nIn Luoyang, who does not buy a dwelling?\nYet who else buys one like yours?\n\nA scene of radiance, no dust of this world,\nLandscape through four seasons, a true painted scroll.\nThe rear garden’s blossoms, rare as those of Penglai,\nThe front pavilion’s peaks, fine as those of Penglai’s isles.\n\nTo grow old in such a place—\nThis too is the mark of a hero in the world.\n\n**Chant at Autumn’s End**\nWithin days, autumn is spent,\nA hundred thoughts cannot console its passing.\nThe garden’s beauty, though loved without end,\nYet grasses and trees yellow—what can feeling do?\n\nThough aged, my limbs still strong,\nFrom every high terrace, my gaze still far.\nAll day I raise my cup, yet not drunk,\nAgain I long to face the wind and sing boldly.\n\n**Chant of the Unworthy**\nThe unworthy man,\nHis will set on wandering,\nBody beneath the roof,\nHeart above it.\n\nThe unworthy son,\nHis will set on vanity,\nHis own self not secure,\nHow can he secure his home?\n\n**Chant of the Noble One**\nThe noble one’s departure,\nIs as his arrival.\nThe petty man’s arrival,\nIs as his departure.\n\nWhere there has been kindness,\nLet there be no resentment.\nWhere there has been aversion,\nLet there be no longing.\n\n**Chant of the Petty Man**\nThe petty man has no constancy,\nAbandoning root for branch,\nDelighted when he gains,\nEnraged when he loses.\n\n**Chant of Grasping Hands**\nWealth and honor grasp hands,\nPoverty and lowliness pull back.\nPoverty and lowliness grasp hands,\nWealth and honor pull back.\n\nFriendship of metal and stone,\nEndures even unto death.\nFriendship of the marketplace,\nHardly lasts long.\n\n**Chant of the Great Changes**\nHeaven and Earth take their places,\nAdversity and prosperity reverse their forms.\nMountains and marshes share qi,\nIncrease and decrease reveal rightness.\n\nThunder and wind press close,\nConstancy and benefit arise in intent.\nWater and fire clash,\nCompletion and incompletion alternate.\n\nThe four images intersect,\nForming sixteen matters.\nThe eight trigrams stir one another,\nBecoming sixty-four.\n\n**Chant of Ceasing Chants**\nLong have I wished to cease my chants,\nYet startled—my intent suddenly strange.\nSeated, I know the nature of things,\nBeyond words, I reach the celestial mechanism.\n\nTo gain a line is not so easy,\nTo complete a verse—how could I bear to discard it?\nWho knows if in a thousand myriad ages,\nA later age will lack its Confucius?\n\n**Chant of Gold**\nOn the body, gold is carried,\nNo man sinks in his journey.\nWhen sought, it may not appear,\nWhen found, not through seeking.\n\nEloquence is not understanding,\nContainment is the completion of the heart.\nOnly when one can play the stringless zither,\nCan one then know the true friend.\n\n**Chant of the Partridge**\nAffairs take on a new form,\nYet newness soon turns old.\nNew and old are not beneficial things,\nPrinciple does not follow man.\n\nDo not fear the lateness of years,\nOrioles and blossoms will herald spring again.\nMy remaining cup, fortunately unharmed,\nFitting to sing the partridge’s song often.\n\n**Chant of Leisure**\nIn leisure, the flavor lingers long,\nThe long place is the land of immortals.\nAbundant is the joy of forests and springs,\nPure, without the clamor of markets.\n\nFreely roaming the mysteries of a thousand sages,\nDrunk, embracing the fragrance of ten thousand flowers.\nDo not make matters of heartbreak,\nHeartbreak easily severs the bowels.\n\nIn leisure, the flavor is true,\nThe true place is the people of heaven.\nAbundant is the joy of forests and springs,\nPure, without the dust of markets.\n\nFreely roaming the mysteries of a thousand sages,\nDrunk, embracing the spring of ten thousand flowers.\nDo not make matters of heartbreak,\nHeartbreak saddens and kills.\n\nIn leisure, the flavor is complete,\nThe complete place is the celestial immortal.\nAbundant is the joy of forests and springs,\nPure, without the noise of markets.\n\nFreely observing the mysteries of a thousand sages,\nDrunk, embracing the beauty of ten thousand flowers.\nDo not make matters of heartbreak,\nHeartbreak is best turned away.\n\n**Chant of the Vast Blue**\nEvery person bears the sky,\nDo I bear it in vain?\nOne must know the principle of heaven and man,\nOnly then to know the power of creation.\n\nMerit and fame return to the wine cup,\nVessels and deeds enter the poem.\nI reckon the joy of leisure,\nNone compares to my wholeness.\n\n**Chant of the Round**\nLike a mirror, like a hook,\nRevolving, autumn unremembered.\nHard to fathom the ways of heaven,\nEasy to whiten the heads of the world.\n\nIn fullness, all rejoice,\nIn waning, all things grieve.\nThere is no life without breath,\nWhy wait for the ox of Wu to pant?\n\n**Chant in Place of a Letter**\nA year and more since we parted,\nAt year’s end, our thoughts turn to the beginning.\nAgain I trouble you with warmth,\nTo send afar my emptiness.\n\nA hundred forms of decay and ruin,\nYet not a single care.\nIdle chanting of forty words,\nTo briefly answer your letter.\n\n**Chant of the Lost Poem**\nWithin my breast, wind and rain roar,\nBeneath my brush, dragons and serpents move.\nBefore and after, they fall among men,\nOver three thousand in number.\n\n**Chant of Not Ceasing**\nAt sixty-six years,\nTwo things I do not cease:\nWith poetry, I offer to the true lord,\nWith wine, I toast the image-emperor.\n\nMy face has not yet flushed,\nMy heart first stirs harmonious qi.\nLooking up and down between heaven and earth,\nI know myself without shame.\n\n**Chant of Ordering the World**\nFuxi, Shennong, Yao, Shun,\nTang, Wu, Huan, Wen;\nAugust kings, emperors, lords, and chiefs,\nFathers and sons, rulers and ministers.\n\nThe Way of these four,\nIts principle ended with Qin,\nDescending to the two Han,\nThen passing through the Three Kingdoms.\n\nEast and west in turmoil,\nNorth and south in chaos.\nFive Hu, ten clans,\nThe celestial order nearly burned.\n\nWithout Tang, there would be no salvation,\nWithout Song, no preservation.\nFor a thousand ages, ten thousand ages,\nThe Central Plains have had men.\n\n**Chant of Knowing Men**\nThe noble one knows men through understanding,\nThe petty man knows men through self-interest.\nThrough understanding,\nThose in accord with principle are deemed right, those at odds are deemed wrong.\nThrough self-interest,\nThose in accord with oneself are deemed right, those at odds are deemed wrong.\n\n**Chant of Words and Deeds**\nTo speak well is not difficult,\nTo act is the true challenge.\nOne must be a true man,\nOnly then can one be without shamelessness.\n\n**Chant of Time**\nThree hundred and sixty-six days,\nTime passes before the eye like a rushing wheel.\nRevolving without cease,\nHow can the four seasons long resemble spring?\n\n**Chant of Raising the Cup**\nLeisurely with guests and friends, raising the wine cup,\nIn the cup, flowers ever seem to bloom.\nPure discourse just leaves the mouth,\nHarmonious qi already arises from the heart.\n\nIntent beyond things is not gained from images,\nAmidst sitting, spring does not return from heaven.\nIf this could be applied to the world,\nWhat worry would the world not cast aside?\n\n**Chant of Too Little Wine**\n\n**Chant of This Thing (Wine)**\nLately scarce for the poor,\nYet now and then, a few pounds gained.\nLike tea, it betrays the aged,\nLike medicine, it fails old friends.\nBefore drinking, fear it will run dry,\nThough poured, dare not drink too deep.\nHow to share it on Double Ninth,\nWith white-robed guests ever near?\n\n**Quatrain on Watching Chess**\nUnshaken by the urge to vie,\nYet black and white still grip the mind.\nOne path stands peerless,\nFully seen, yet none pursue.\n\nUnshaken by the urge to vie,\nYet black and white still stir the heart.\nOne path lies smooth and sure,\nYet none tread—what a waste!\n\n**Chant of Growing Old**\nGrown old, no achievements, temples streaked with gray,\nHow many years remain to follow the heart’s ease?\nHow to find content beyond clouds and peaks,\nAnd wander still in poetry and wine?\nLarge characters write poems to fulfill plain aims,\nSmall cups pour wine to flush the cheeks with red.\nSpring thunder rouses creatures buried for a thousand years,\nBeneath the brush, the azure dragon moves to and fro.\n\n**Chant of Scattered Stones**\nTianjin’s shores are strewn with stones,\nAmidst which I idly seek.\nPure jade is hard to find,\nJade-like stones are rare as well.\nSome are dull and green,\nOthers gleam with phosphorescent white.\nYet none ring with a clear, ringing tone,\nNor bear the warmth and luster of true jade.\n\n**Chant of Having Nothing**\nNo merit to my name,\nYet enemies I’ve made tenfold.\nNothing gained,\nYet losses know no bound.\n\nNo yielding in the least,\nYet strife I’ve stirred tenfold.\nWhat’s lost is substance,\nWhat’s gained is but an empty name.\n\n**Chant of Admonishing a Son**\nThe rarest pearl is flawless,\nThe finest jade is without blemish.\nIf pearls and jade must be so,\nHow much more should a man strive to be without fault?\nFailing to correct one’s errors,\nRefusing to draw near the wise—\nThough born into this world,\nOne cannot be called truly human.\nZhou and Kong are not enough to emulate,\nMeng and Xiong not enough to follow.\nOne might as well abandon common fare,\nOr flee to the wilds of the barbarians.\nThe Dao is not far from man,\nFor heaven and earth reside within the self.\nWho seeks them beyond this,\nWill find them nowhere else.\n\n**Chant of Hu and Yue**\nOn the day Hu and Yue are of one heart,\nHusband and wife turn against each other.\nIn this world, no matter great or small,\nGain and loss hang by a thread.\n\n**Chant of Good Conduct**\nTo act well in times of trouble is hard,\nYet holding fast refines the self.\nWith nothing foreign in heart or mind,\nEven barbarians grow gentle.\n\n**Chant of a Hundred Years**\nA hundred years slip by in haste,\nA thousand miles stretch desolate and bleak.\nHow can one bear to follow the eastward-flowing waters,\nDrifting without end, at the mercy of the tide?\n\n**Chant of Year’s End**\nDay by day, the days depart,\nYear by year, the years accrue.\nThough one may yet become a vessel great,\nAlas, the temples have already turned to frost.\nThe will remains unchanged,\nYet wit and brightness fade.\nWere it not for the heart’s attainment,\nOne might well aspire to be an immortal.\n\n**Short Chant on Watching Chess**\nWho says board games are mere leisure,\nWhen gain and loss grind on without cease?\nAt the first advantage, look ahead,\nWhere strategy is needed, tarry not.\nTwo years to right the Three Supervisors’ crimes,\nSeven days to occupy the Two Observatories.\nWhen the world is at peace, with nothing amiss,\nWhat more could one seek than reclining in Nanyang?\n\n**Another Poem on Lending Out**\nIn the nest of peace and joy,\nA myriad pipes of Nüwa’s panpipes resound.\nSince lending it out in idleness,\nGuests arrive, yet no delight remains.\n\n**In Response to Wang Guifu’s Gift of \"On Movement\"**\nNot just a thousand or ten thousand years,\nThe frost-defying pine and cassia stand alone.\nWere it not for Yangzi’s learning of heaven and man,\nHow could Zhuangzi’s inner and outer chapters exist?\nAlready we’ve agreed to seek white stones by the moonlit pool,\nAnd further to play with clear springs in Golden Valley.\nWho says the clamor of shadows is too great?\nLet the peaks rise and rise again.\n\n**Chant in Reply to a Friend Urging Wine**\nWho does not wish to be enfeoffed as a marquis?\nYet once enfeoffed, none are content to stop.\nGreat gains must guard against great losses,\nMany worries stem from many desires.\nHow dare I compare myself to men of talent?\nI know my measure is not that of a drinking sage.\nHow could I have forced myself in younger days?\nNow, with age and snow upon my head, even less so.\n\n*Yichuan Jirang Ji, Volume Seventeen Concludes*\n*Yichuan Jirang Ji, Volume Eighteen*\n\n**Yichuan Shao Yong Yaofu’s “Winter Solstice Chant”**\nWhat is called the subtle moment?\nThe heavenly root, the principle most fine.\nHere at the year’s final close,\nThere at the morrow yet to arrive.\nThis juncture is easily grasped,\nYet none refuse its fleeting sign.\nWho knows this truth may guard their affairs,\nBut few can fathom its design.\n\n**“Cup and Plate Chant”**\nBeneath the trees, cups and plates lie still in quietude,\nAnd long I wish this quietude would last as now it does.\nBehold those who beat drums and strike bells—\nOnce their power wanes, friends are not easily called.\n\n**“Joyful Chant”**\nPraise the good, not the ill,\nRemember kindness, not grudges.\nLet each rejoice in themselves,\nWhat need to lament few companions?\n\n**“Virtuous Chant”**\nGood as gold and jade,\nWeighty as hills and mountains,\nDignified as phoenix and simurgh,\nFragrant as orchid and angelica.\n\n**“Discourse Chant”**\nIf a matter is wrong, it stands apart.\nIf a matter is right, how could there be two ways?\n\n**“Sincerity Chant”**\nThough heaven does not speak, man may speak,\nYet when the heart may be deceived, heaven may be deceived.\nHeaven and man are not far apart,\nBut only in the human heart do men not see.\nThe human heart precedes heaven, and heaven does not oppose it;\nThe human body follows heaven, serving its time.\nBody and heart are not far apart,\nBut only in human sincerity do men not reflect.\n\n**“Yaofu’s Chant”**\nYaofu chants: the world calls me dull,\nComing without season, going without measure.\nLike mountains and rivers, my path knows no end;\nLike streams and seas, my flow knows no cease.\nLike orchid and angelica, my fragrance never fades;\nLike the *Xiaoshao* music, my sound never breaks.\nThere are flowers, there is snow,\nThere is wind, there is moon.\nNow gentle, now stern;\nNow refined, now fervent.\n\n**“Unexpected Chant”**\nWhen matters arise beyond expectation,\nForesight cannot grasp them.\nIf not moved by recklessness,\nWhy indulge in needless sorrow?\nEven in error there may be fortune,\nAnd in darkness, unseen guidance.\nWho understands this truth,\nWhat worry remains under heaven?\n\n**“Decisive Chant”**\nDecide to resolve doubt—doubt must not linger.\nTo hesitate when one should decide\nIs to invite chaos in return.\n\n**“Dream of Worry Chant”**\nThe perfected have no dreams,\nThe sages have no worries.\nDreams come from overthinking,\nWorries from overreaching.\nIf worries do not arise,\nFrom where do dreams come?\nWho understands this truth,\nWhat more need they cultivate?\n\n**“Human Sentiment Chant”**\nTo understand human sentiment,\nNeither narrow nor broad.\nAll under heaven’s affairs\nAre as clear as one’s palm.\n\n**“Human Affairs Chant”**\nMen must not act carelessly,\nMatters must not be left to drift.\nDrifting loses the moment,\nCarelessness corrupts the man.\nMen must not act rashly,\nMatters prize attentiveness.\nRashness leans toward shallowness,\nAttentiveness leans toward sincerity.\n\n**“Teacher and Resource Chant”**\nNot yet knowing the Dao’s meaning,\nOne seeks others as teachers.\nOnce knowing the Dao’s meaning,\nOthers come as resources.\nSeeking teachers is not easy,\nBeing a resource is truly hard.\nPointing south to guide the Way,\nNeither departing nor returning.\nTo feel shame at teaching others,\nTo feel joy at being taught—\nBoth are misplaced.\nI alone am free of this.\nTo delight in teaching others,\nHow is this different from obstinacy?\n\n**“Heaven and Man Chant”**\nHeaven’s study is to cultivate the heart,\nMan’s study is to cultivate the body.\nWhen body is at peace and heart is joyful,\nThen heaven and man are seen.\nHeaven and man are not far apart,\nYet few know this—\nThose who do are rare.\nThe body is governed by man,\nThe heart is governed by heaven.\nIf the heart is not joyful,\nHow can the body be at peace?\n\n**“Yue Yi Chant”**\nWhen Yue Yi served Yan,\nHis heart held a profound intent.\nBreaking Qi’s seventy cities,\nHis blade met no resistance.\nWhy spare Jimo and Ju?\nYet his loyalty to Yan remained unbroken.\nHe wished for Yan to become king,\nAnd for all under heaven to begin with Qi.\nWas his will not yet fulfilled\nWhen King Zhao suddenly died?\nKing Hui, ignorant of his worth,\nSent another to replace him.\nMighty Yan declined from then,\nNever again to rise.\nSince ancient times, lord and minister—\nTheir meeting is not easily found.\nHow precious are these thousand myriad years,\nThat move even heroes to tears.\n\n**“The Perfect Ten Chant”**\nWhat is called a perfect man?\nOne must possess perfect truth.\nNot merely one who writes well,\nNor one who composes fine prose.\nNot for fine brows and bright eyes,\nNor for new robes and fresh clothes.\nTo walk in the world of men,\nOne must first perfect the self.\n\nWhat is called a perfect man?\nOne must accomplish perfect deeds.\nIf deeds are not perfect,\nThey remain incomplete.\nServing one’s father with whole heart,\nServing one’s elder brother with whole intent,\nServing one’s lord with whole loyalty,\nServing one’s teacher with whole duty.\nA man’s life spans a hundred years,\nHow easily it passes!\nThough but a fleeting moment,\nHow much transpires within!\nTo be called one who completes affairs,\nOne must first complete the self.\nIf the self is not yet complete,\nHow can one complete others?\n\n**“Birthday Chant”**\n*Cyclic signs: Xin-Hai, twelfth month, twenty-fifth day*\nYear: Xin-Hai, month: Xin-Chou,\nDay: Jia-Zi, hour: Jia-Xu.\nDay and hour share Jia,\nYear and month share Xin.\nAt this moment,\nI was born into this world as man.\n\n**“Admonition to My Sons Chant”**\nThe rooster can herald dawn,\nThe horse can take one’s place in travel,\nThe dog can guard and defend,\nThe ox can plow the fields.\nMan, born between heaven and earth,\nSpirit of all things—\nYet envying the worthy and resenting the able,\nBetter not to have been born at all.\n\n**“The Constant Chant”**\nHeaven and earth have constant principles,\nSun and moon have constant brightness.\nThe four seasons have constant order,\nGhosts and spirits have constant numinosity.\nThe sage has constant virtue,\nThe petty man has no constant disposition.\n\n**“Yearning Chant”**\nThe world’s splendor fades from sight,\nBefore my eyes, only books command reverence.\nThough a hundred thousand hardships still startle,\nThe years before thirty were the most bitter.\nIn youth, I knew only perilous paths,\nIn old age, I recognize the peace of ease.\nFortunate that my family’s legacy has heirs,\nEnough to wander carefree with the white clouds.\n\n**“Spring Chant”**\nA piece of spring lies before my eyes,\nBefore my eyes, know this good spring.\nSpring, autumn, winter, summer—free of burdens,\nSnow, moon, wind, flowers—all flow as one.\nTo use true richness for one’s work,\nWhy fear other things harming its warmth and beauty?\nHow fortunate is my life—what abundance!\nHow could idle sorrows reach my ears?\n\n**“Nearly There Chant”**\nTo demand saintliness of others\nIs surely not yet complete.\nTo expect humanity from others\nLeaves room for improvement.\nHolding others to account is not hard,\nBut receiving reproach is not easy.\nTo be nearly there—\nOne still looks to Yanzi.\n\n**“People and Things Chant”**\nPeople flourish and must decline,\nThings arise and must perish.\n\n**“On Seeing Those Before Me”**\nHaving seen those who came before,\nI now know what comes after.\nIf those before could rise,\nHow could what follows be abandoned?\nRise and fall begin with people,\nOnly then do we speak of heaven and earth.\n\n**“Sighs of Amazement Chant”**\nYesterday, burning with power,\nToday, caught in the net.\nSuch are the common affairs of men—\nWhy gasp in amazement, why sigh?\n\n**“Left-Lapelled Robes Chant”**\nSince ancient times, no supreme strategy has governed the frontier,\nOnly by virtue and righteousness does the Central Plain stand.\nThe royal army’s punitive campaign may be justified,\nBut how can one bear to speak of the Son of Heaven’s exile?\nThe two Jin dynasties fell into chaos and became overgrown grass,\nThe three lords endured humiliation, their names stricken from the records.\nWho were Gong, Lü, Yan, and Guang?\nOnly now do I believe that reviving a nation begins with a single word.\n\n**“Teaching and Exhortation Chant”**\nTo claim sageliness or benevolence—I dare not,\nYet empty words still suffice to console this fleeting life.\nTo clearly expound teaching and exhortation is the constant Way,\nThat descendants may forever uphold a good name.\nThough today’s legacy remains obscure,\nThe blessings received in time to come will not be light.\nIf this intent flows throughout the world,\nHow could the world fail to know great peace?\n\n**“The Unvirtuous Chant”**\nAlas for the unvirtuous,\nEndowed with cruel and violent power.\nNot only do they ruin families,\nBut they can also ruin nations.\n\n**“Many Affairs Chant”**\nMany affairs invite worry,\nMany doubts invite vexation,\nMany gifts invite stinginess,\nMany takings invite loss.\n\n**“Conducting Oneself Chant”**\nThe noble person in conduct\nPrefers others to wrong them rather than wrong others.\nThe petty person in affairs\nPrefers to wrong others rather than be wronged by them.\n\n**“Observing Nature Chant”**\nPeople of a thousand myriad years,\nAffairs of a thousand myriad years,\nPassions of a thousand myriad years,\nPrinciples of a thousand myriad years.\nOnly through learning can one\nSit and contemplate them all in clarity.\n\n**“Observing Things Chant”**\nDwelling in darkness, observe the bright;\nDwelling in stillness, observe the moving;\nDwelling in simplicity, observe the complex;\nDwelling in lightness, observe the weighty.\nWhat one dwells in is few,\nWhat one observes is many.\nWithout dwelling, without observing,\nWhat use are the many or the few?\n\n**“In Response to Wu Chuanzheng, Vice Censor-in-Chief, Two Poems”**\n*Also sent to Wang Shisan of Gaoyang*\n\nWithin Luoyang’s walls, a foolish old man,\nFor over a decade, I have not read books.\nIn old age, my feelings are hard to describe—\nPale mist and cold moon illuminate sparse pines.\n\nDelighting in stillness, am I free of illness?\nLoving leisure, my heart remains.\nHow could I compare to those self-content,\nWho drift with the world’s ebb and flow?\n\n**“Right and Wrong Chant”**\nTo call short right and long wrong,\nTo favor red and despise white.\nA lifetime of trivial pursuits,\nNever free from love and hate.\nIf love and hate do not depart,\nHow can right and wrong be settled?\nOnce love and hate are gone,\nWhat use are right and wrong?\n\n**“Purifying the Heart Chant”**\nMany seek to purify the body,\nFew seek to purify the heart.\nPurifying the body washes away dust and grime,\nPurifying the heart washes away depravity and excess.\nDust and grime are cleansed with water,\nBut depravity cannot be rinsed away.\nTo truly cleanse the heart’s filth,\nOne must pluck the stringless zither.\n\n**“On Seeing Things Chant”**\nSeeing things, I sing and chant,\nNever needing deliberate intent.\nLeisurely composing poems of bamboo baskets,\nQuietly observing the world’s affairs.\n\n**“Toiling the Fields Chant”**\nIn spring, plow and sow,\nIn summer, weed and hoe,\nIn autumn, harvest and prepare,\nIn winter, use and store.\nWhen rain and dew are timely,\nShoots sprout and ears form.\nBut if flood or drought strike,\nOne still bears the blame.\n\n**“Sixty-Six Years Chant”**\nAt sixty-six years,\nJoyfully holding my wine cup.\nIn youth, no grand ambitions,\nIn old age, this open heart.\nOften my heroic spirit stirs,\nFrom time to time, fine verses come.\nI have gathered three hundred poems,\nAnd deem them equal to jade treasures.\n\n**“Lenience and Severity Chant”**\nLenience makes the people lax,\nSeverity makes the people suffer.\nLenience and severity in balance,\nThe people find their own peace.\n\n**“Minor Arts Chant”**\nThough arts may be minor,\nTheir effects can strike deep.\nIf one does not delve into subtleties,\nHow can one attain the divine?\n\n**“Gain and Loss Chant”**\nPeople differ in worth,\nAffairs vary in scale.\nGains are not easily won,\nLosses come all too readily.\n\n**“Fumigation and Study Chant”**\nBetween good and evil,\nFumigation still reveals traces.\nDraw near to fragrance, and you will be fragrant;\nDraw near to stench, and you will stink.\n\n**“Love and Hate Chant”**\nTo hate death and love life,\nTo shun harm and seek benefit—\nSuch are the feelings of all under heaven,\nNo different in any.\n\n**“Year’s End Chant”**\nThis feeling others do not know,\nYet I often sigh at the fading year.\nThough I sigh at the fading year,\nWhat can I do? It is hard to entrust.\nThis feeling others do not know,\nYet I often sigh at the long passage of time.\nThough I sigh at the long passage,\nWhat can I do? Others do not receive it.\n\n**“Contentment Chant”**\nLightly gained, easily lost,\nMuch scheming, little achieved.\nVirtue has no end to its benefits,\nGoodness seeks no near fame.\n\n**“Following Others Chant”**\nTo follow others and lose,\nIs to treat their words as guests.\nFrom now on,\nHow can I trust others again?\n\n**“Poetry and Painting Chant”**\nThe painter’s brush excels at depicting things,\nSkilled in wielding red and green.\nRed and green enter subtle thought,\nAnd ten thousand things reveal no hidden form.\nPoetry and prose excel at depicting things,\nSkilled in wielding sincere intent.\nSincere intent enters fine verses,\nAnd ten thousand things reveal no hidden feelings.\n\nPoetry is the will of man,\nSpeech is the voice of the heart.\nWill is expressed through words,\nVoice is shaped by rhythm.\nTo know many birds and beasts,\nIs it only their feathers and quills?\nTo know many grasses and trees,\nIs it only their branches and stems?\nWithout the *Feng*, *Ya*, and *Song*,\nHow could one know merit and fame?\nWithout the *Ze*, *Bi*, and *Xing*,\nHow could one know rise and fall?\nBeholding the court’s grand affairs,\nThe majesty of the altars of soil and grain.\nThere were Tang and Wu’s foundations,\nNo You or Li’s songs of decline.\nKnowing the difficulty of achievement,\nHow could one lose it through arrogance?\nBanish great vermin and treachery,\nAdvance rare worthies and talents.\nGather the essence of yin and yang,\nSeek the spirit of heaven and earth.\nDraw from rivers and mountains’ purity,\nRaise the glory of sun and moon.\nGather these as the people’s ultimate,\nInscribe them as the nation’s canon.\nBroadcast them on metal and stone,\nPerform them in the grand court.\nMove the hearts of the people,\nInform the spirits and gods.\nWhen people and spirits are both pleased,\nThis is what is called harmonious broth.\nSince there were Yu Shun’s songs,\nHow could there be no Gao Yao’s responses?\nSince there was Confucius’ editing,\nHow could there be no Ji Zha’s listening?\nIf one wishes to bring joy to all under heaven,\nWithout poetry, what else could suffice?\nWith the remnants of my learning,\nGreat peace may yet be achieved.\n\n**“Poetry as History Chant”**\nThe historian’s brush excels at recording events,\nSkilled in displaying its prose.\nWhen prose prevails, truth is lost,\nAnd all that remains are empty words.\nPoetry as history excels at recording events,\nSkilled in crafting their truth.\nWhen truth prevails, ornament fades,\nNot like the chaos of mere appearances.\n\nThe world is not one affair,\nThe world is not one man.\nThe world is not one thing,\nThe world is not one body.\nIn the eras of emperors and kings,\nTheir people endure as if ever-present.\nFor a hundred thousand myriad years,\nTheir deeds remain ever-new.\nThey can discern the myriad policies,\nThey can order the common people.\nThey can recount the ancestors,\nThey can instruct the descendants.\nThey can honor the Son of Heaven,\nThey can discipline the three armies.\nThey can advance remonstrance,\nThey can extol meritorious deeds.\nThey can transform customs,\nThey can deepen human relations.\nThey can beautify education,\nThey can harmonize the distant and the near.\nThey can rectify husband and wife,\nThey can clarify ruler and minister.\nThey can praise Heaven and Earth,\nThey can move ghosts and spirits.\nHow earnestly they admonish others,\nHow earnestly they instruct others.\nHow reluctantly they part from others,\nHow sincerely they bestow upon others.\nNo year lacks its fine festivals,\nNo month lacks its fine days.\nNo time lacks its fine scenes,\nNo day lacks its fine guests.\nIn the goblet there is fine wine,\nAt the seat there is no ominous vapor.\nIn the breast there are fine things,\nIn the heart there is no dust.\nHow can one bear not to wield the great brush,\nWriting characters as large as cartwheels?\nOver three thousand poems,\nSpread as spring throughout the world.\n\n**“Elaboration Chant”**\nAll affairs enter deep contemplation,\nTheir flavor grows ever deeper.\nThough they once passed before the eyes,\nThey must be pondered in the heart.\nPassing by, one has not fully seen;\nPondering, one is willing to seek thoroughly.\nOnly by thorough seeking can one see,\nAnd only then is it true gold.\nWhat is true gold?\nTrue gold sinks into the bones.\nHaving endured forging and tempering,\nIt is worthy and needs no contemplation.\nOnce in hand, what need is there for eyes?\nIn conduct, how dare one be careless?\nCarefree only after being at ease,\nIn the world there are those who understand.\nWhat are those who understand?\nThose who understand reside only in the heart.\nThe liver and spleen show no effect,\nIn bells and drums, one searches in vain.\nIf one can already disclose things,\nWhat need is there to further play the zither?\nThe phoenix’s arrival is not for itself,\nIt is only to deeply move others.\nWhat is the phoenix’s arrival?\nThe phoenix’s arrival bears no low intent.\nWith bodies all joyful,\nWithout things not harmonious.\nIf a state were like one thing,\nThe four directions would be like limbs.\nHow majestic were Yao and Shun,\nHow could they be named?\n\n**“History and Painting Chant”**\nThe historian’s brush excels at recording events,\nThe painter’s brush excels at depicting things.\nDepicting things and recording events,\nEach excels in one.\nPoetry as history excels at recording intent,\nPoetry and painting excel at depicting emotion.\nDepicting emotion and recording intent,\nBoth can be precise.\nDepicting emotion does not depict things,\nRecording intent does not record events.\nForm and appearance emerge from creation,\nImagination completes Heaven and Earth.\nSubstance and function thus divide,\nEven ghosts and spirits dare not differ.\nWhat is poetry if not this?\nIt is history and painting combined.\n\n**“Competition Chant”**\nPeople have no love of competition,\nAffairs have no excess of seeking.\nCompetition brings much humiliation,\nExcessive seeking brings much sorrow.\nSorrow and humiliation arrive together,\nAnd virtue does not wander.\nNot only does it harm others,\nIt also becomes the body’s enemy.\n\n**“Governing the Heart Chant”**\nThe heart is closer than the body,\nThe body is closer than others.\nIf one cannot govern the heart,\nHow can one govern the body?\nIf one cannot govern the body,\nHow can one govern others?\n\n**“My Hut Chant”**\nI too love my hut,\nMy hut resembles a rustic dwelling.\nMy nature follows the Dao, shared with the heavens,\nMy body is distant from the world.\nEverywhere, fragrant grasses grow,\nOn my bed, disordered books pile.\nSince there have been no affairs,\nI no longer apply effort.\n\n**“Human Spirit Chant”**\nHeaven and Earth give birth to the myriad things,\nAmong them, humans are the most spiritually endowed.\nHaving the spirit of humanity,\nOne must also have human emotions.\nWithout human emotions,\nOne merely has the form of a human.\n\n**“Passing By Chant”**\nDo not be startled by things passing by in profusion,\nAs gains and losses grind against each other, never settling.\nThough skills may be many, they have no real effect,\nAnd when cleverness reaches its peak, it is but an empty name.\nThe warmth, coolness, cold, and heat of the four seasons,\nThe sweet, bitter, pungent, and sour of the myriad things.\nApart from this heart, all are external things,\nYet even this heart may not be fully awakened.\n\n**“Disaster Chant”**\nDisaster from without\nCan still be dispelled.\nDisaster from within,\nHow can it be withstood?\nBetween Heaven and humanity,\nExamine both within and without.\n\n**“Within and Without Chant”**\nEyes, ears, nose, and mouth,\nAre humanity’s doors and windows.\nHeart, gall, spleen, and kidneys,\nAre humanity’s inner currents.\nIf one can guard within,\nWithout will not be received.\nIf within there is no guard,\nHow can without endure?\n\n**“Fame and Profit Chant”**\nWeighing heavily with fame\nReveals others’ emotions.\nEnriching with profit\nReveals others’ intentions.\nEmotions and intentions are within,\nIf within is weighty, without is light.\nFame and profit are without,\nIf within is base, without is noble.\n\n**“Name and Reality Chant”**\nWithin, there is no reality,\nWithout, there is a name—\nThe petty person thus boasts.\nWithout, there is no name,\nWithin, there is reality—\nWhat does the noble person lose?\n\n**“Nature and Emotion Chant”**\nThe noble person follows nature,\nThe petty person follows emotion.\nFollowing nature, one draws near,\nFollowing emotion, one drifts far.\n\n**“Exhortation Chant”**\nPeople should not be negligent,\nAffairs value earnestness.\nNegligence approaches shallowness,\nEarnestness approaches sincerity.\n\n**“Doubt and Trust Chant”**\nPeople should not be credulous,\nAffairs should not be doubted excessively.\nCredulity invites provocation,\nExcessive doubt invites separation.\n\n**“Order and Chaos Chant”**\nNoble persons and petty persons\nOften stand in equal measure.\nSometimes they halt, sometimes they act,\nNow in order, now in chaos.\n\n**“Timeliness Chant”**\nThe dragon does not leap in winter,\nThe firefly can fly at night.\nPetty persons and noble persons,\nAll have their time.\n\n**“Loyalty and Thickness Chant”**\nThe petty person is momentary,\nThe noble person endures.\nMomentary, they incline toward perversity,\nEnduring, they remain loyal and sincere.\n\n**“Deep Winter Chant”**\nThe twelfth month draws to a close,\nAnd one is startled that the year’s rhythm is exhausted.\nIce is stored in the northern lands,\nThe thaw has not yet come with the east wind.\nIn the dimness, one vainly seeks green,\nOn the flower branches, one forces a search for red.\nSeeking spring, spring is not seen,\nIt is only within the breast.\n\n**“Knowing Wrong Chant”**\nAll that came before today,\nKnowing wrong, the heart can rely on.\nEmpty words are not worth speaking,\nTrue conduct—what need for pride?\nThere is no medicine for aging,\nBut there is poetry to praise sagely brightness.\nThough one may drink at times,\nOne need not imitate Liu Ling.\n\n**“Winter Solstice Chant”**\nAt the winter solstice, midnight’s midpoint,\nThe heart of Heaven does not change or shift.\nWhere the first yang arises,\nBefore the myriad things are born.\nThe flavor of dark wine is just mild,\nThe sound of the great tone is truly rare.\n\nIf you doubt these words, ask Fuxi again.\n\n**\"White-Haired Chant\"**\nWhite-haired for many years now,\nHow much longer can these whiskers hang?\nYet I count myself fortunate still—\nThis decline is not yet complete.\nThough my house lacks silver,\nI have sons to carry on the line.\nDare I call poverty pure?\nFew like me can claim the same.\n\n**\"On Poetry Chant\"**\nPoetry is the heart of man,\nWithout verse, the heart cannot be known.\nWhen people harmonize, their minds are fully seen,\nWhen Heaven grants, intent is linked.\nDiscussing things gives rise to fresh lines,\nJudging texts refines elegant speech.\nWhen inspiration comes, it is as if preordained,\nNo need for carving or chiseling.\n\n**\"Water and Cord Chant\"**\nWater can be level but not straight,\nA cord can be straight but not level.\nIf only human nature were like water and cord,\nThe world would know no strife.\n\n**\"Punishment and Name Chant\"**\nThe noble man seeks renown,\nThe petty man courts punishment.\nGood and evil differ in kind,\nYet both arise from following desire.\n\n**\"Yin and Yang Chant\"**\nYang moves as one, yin moves as two,\nOne governs Heaven, two govern Earth.\nHeaven moves in sixes, Earth in fours;\nFour governs form, six governs qi.\n\n**\"Human Affairs Chant\"**\nPeople come and go,\nAffairs rise and fall;\nTraces may be sparse or dense,\nBut people make no comparisons.\nMaster these four truths,\nAnd you shall endure.\n\n**\"Inner and Outer Chant\"**\nNeat attire and dignified bearing—\nThis is outer cultivation.\nPure conduct and righteousness—\nThis is inner cultivation.\nCultivate both inner and outer,\nAnd who would not seek you?\nDisheveled dress and slovenly manner—\nThis is outer neglect.\nLacking righteousness in conduct—\nThis is inner neglect.\nNeglect both inner and outer,\nAnd who would not spurn you?\n\n**\"Rise and Fall Chant\"**\nWorthy descendants\nRevive the family name.\nUnworthy descendants\nRuin the family name.\nAlas, descendants—\nThe root of rise and fall.\n\n**\"Life and Death Chant\"**\nTo study immortality is to seek not to die,\nTo study Buddhism is to seek rebirth.\nRebirth or not dying—\nCan man truly achieve either?\nIf man could truly achieve them,\nOnly then would it enter the realm of feeling.\nHow fortunate the recluse,\nUnpitied by the world.\nHow lamentable the lord and minister,\nDeeply deluded by the world.\n\n**\"Birthday Chant\"**\nThirty-five thousand days—\nThis body is my allotment.\nOnce but a thing of the moment,\nNow at last a man.\nLong indebted to the power of yin and yang,\nEver owing the kindness of father and mother.\nRaise a cup of birthday wine,\nWith children and grandchildren gathered in the grove.\n\n**\"Timely Matters Chant\"**\nWhen the time comes,\nIts momentum may be seized.\nWhen the time departs,\nIts affairs arise anew.\nWhat was done yesterday\nCannot be done today.\nWhat is done today\nWill surely change later.\nTime prolonged breeds trouble,\nAffairs prolonged breed corruption.\nCorruption and trouble follow one another—\nHow can man find peace?\n\n**\"Ignorance Chant\"**\nIgnorant of yin and yang,\nIgnorant of Heaven and Earth,\nIgnorant of human nature,\nIgnorant of the principles of things.\nPresuming to teach others—\nWould one not feel shame?\n\n**\"Water and Fire Chant\"**\nWhen water and fire are mastered,\nTheir union brings completion.\nWhen water and fire are uncontrolled,\nBurning and drowning come swiftly.\nNot only water and fire—\nAll things are thus.\nKnowing only how to use water and fire,\nNot knowing the meaning of water and fire.\n\n**\"Central Plains Chant\"**\nThe armies of the Central Plains\nTake benevolence and righteousness as their guide.\nWithout benevolence and righteousness,\nThe four barbarians come to humiliate.\n**\"Joyful Drinking Chant\"**\nYaofu loved to drink,\nDrinking to preserve his true nature.\nHe did not like to become drunk,\nOnly to reach a gentle tipsiness.\nWhat is the scene of gentle tipsiness?\nThe heart’s landscape like early spring.\nWhat is the scene of early spring?\nHeaven and Earth just beginning to stir.\nUnknowing that the self is man,\nUnknowing that man is the self.\nOnly knowing self and man,\nUndivided from Heaven.\n\n**\"Feelings Chant\"**\nHuman life has no fixed course,\nAffairs take many forms.\nIn perilous doubt as a traveling official,\nRead your family letters carefully.\nOnly after enduring hardship and danger\nCan one truly appreciate peace and safety.\nA man’s life’s work\nMust be viewed when the pain has settled.\n\n**\"Action and Stillness Chant\"**\nWhen the time is to stop, stop;\nWhen the time is to act, act.\nWhether to act or stop,\nDo not force it with human effort.\n\n**\"Times of Peace Chant\"**\nIn times of peace, within gardens and pavilions,\nIn years of plenty, among villages and hamlets.\nThe flavor is hard to describe,\nAs wind, mist, grass, and trees all lie at ease.\n\n**\"Seeking Spring Chant\"**\nGrass color faintly green,\nFlower tips vaguely red.\nHard to put into words—\nLike intoxication in the heart.\n\n**\"Not Venturing Forth Chant\"**\nWinter and summer, rarely venturing out,\nOnly moving between southern and northern gardens.\nIf one encounters fine scenery,\nOne may yet reach the Three Heavens.\nWestward two hundred paces to Heaven’s Street,\nNorthward three hundred paces to Heaven’s Ford,\nEastward four hundred paces to Heaven’s Palace.\n\n*Yichuan Jirang Ji*, Scroll Eighteen concludes.\n*Yichuan Jirang Ji*, Scroll Nineteen.\n\n**Yichuan Shao Yong Yaofu**\n\nThe unvirtuous,\nEndowed with impure qi,\nSerpentine in disposition,\nWolfish in nature.\n\nThe truly virtuous,\nEndowed with clear and luminous qi,\nGolden and jadelike in nature,\nOrchid and iris in disposition.\n\n**\"Different Chants\"**\nThe noble person,\nUnlike oneself,\nRejoices at goodness,\nDelights in worthiness.\n\nThe petty person,\nUnlike oneself,\nResents goodness,\nRages at worthiness.\n\n**\"Gain and Loss Chant\"**\nTime is hard to gain yet easy to lose,\nThough the heart may regret, what can be retrieved?\nUnaware that old age has already arrived,\nUnaware that aspirations and wishes have gone astray.\n\n**\"Lament Chant\"**\nLament! Time is hard to gain,\nGrieve! The Dao remains untransmitted.\nThis year now draws to a close,\nTomorrow begins the new year.\n\n**\"Year’s End\"**\nHalf a hundred, hair already gray,\nNow even more silvery white.\nKnowing myself as a scholar,\nOthers marvel at a divine immortal.\nWind and moon hard to forget—wine,\nClouds and mountains need no coin.\nSixty-six years now passed,\nTomorrow adds another year.\n\n**\"Inspired Writing Chant\"**\n*Xining tenth year*\nWindow bright, air warm and mild,\nWine fine, hand supple and soft.\nInspiration soars, emotions stirred,\nBrush falls—spring blossoms burst forth.\n\n**\"Reflection on Shadows Chant\"**\nNature resides within the body,\nShadows lie beyond the form.\nNature moves, the body follows,\nForm moves, shadows gather.\nIf body and nature cease,\nWhere then are form and shadow?\nWords beyond shadows—\nWhat is there to marvel?\n\n**\"Joy and Sorrow Chant\"**\nGreat joy and great sorrow,\nNeither allows sleep.\nIf either could bring sleep,\nWhat concern would not be resolved?\n\n**\"Insight Dawns Chant\"**\nWhen the principles of things dawn,\nWhen human sentiments are laid bare—\nThe body is wholly mine,\nGrowing lean, then plump again.\n\nWhen the principles of things dawn,\nWhen human sentiments are laid bare—\nTo seal the Pass of Han,\nA single pellet of clay suffices.\n\nWhen the principles of things dawn,\nWhen human sentiments are laid bare—\nLike wielding a treasured sword,\nCutting jade as if through mud.\n\nWhen the principles of things dawn,\nWhen human sentiments are laid bare—\nThirst quenched by fine wine,\nIllness cured by a skilled physician.\n\nWhen the principles of things dawn,\nWhen human sentiments are laid bare—\nA single word can\nResolve a century’s confusion.\n\nWhen the principles of things dawn,\nWhen human sentiments are laid bare—\nWithin sentiment, the essence of things is clear,\nBeyond principle, the workings of heaven revealed.\n\nWhen the principles of things dawn,\nWhen human sentiments are laid bare—\nPitiable and contemptible,\nDeserving scorn and ridicule.\n\nWhen the principles of things dawn,\nWhen human sentiments first break—\nUnfit for exhortation,\nOnly for sighs.\n\nWhen the principles of things dawn,\nWhen human sentiments are yet unbroken—\nOnly fit to wield the brush,\nNot to hold power.\n\nWhen the principles of things dawn,\nWhen human sentiments are fully broken—\nOnly fit for a first glance,\nNot for prolonged stay.\n\nWhen the principles of things dawn,\nWhen human sentiments are laid bare—\nTo know flowers in full bloom,\nLeaves must first scatter.\n\nWhen the principles of things dawn,\nWhen human sentiments are laid bare—\nWith power to act,\nWhat need for further cunning?\n\nWhen the principles of things dawn,\nWhen human sentiments are laid bare—\nDare one speak of worldly affairs?\nOnce in hand, what could be difficult?\n\n**\"Joyful Drinking Chant\"**\nAll my life, I’ve loved to drink,\nLoving light and mellow wine.\nI dislike deep intoxication,\nOnly a gentle warmth suffices.\nHarmonious as a second youth,\nGentle as early spring.\nYet this is hard to describe—\nThe Two Modes remain undivided.\n\n**\"Nobility and Baseness Chant\"**\nWhat strikes me,\nI can act upon with strength.\nWhat binds me to others,\nIs hard to contend with force.\nNoble as the lord of ten thousand chariots,\nYet never proud.\nBase as a commoner,\nYet never oppressed.\n\n**\"Placement Chant\"**\nIn times of uncertainty,\nIn difficult circumstances,\nAmid peril and doubt,\nObserve how others act.\n\n**\"Exertion Chant\"**\nMatters great or small,\nPeople gain or lose.\nGain comes from care,\nLoss from exertion.\n\n**\"Not Aging Chant\"**\nNo one escapes aging,\nYet the sun may reach its zenith twice.\nTo not age is impossible,\nBut a second zenith may yet come.\n\n**\"Letter in Place of Writing to Zhen Zhang, Garrison Field Officer\"**\nTwenty springs have passed since we parted,\nSuddenly your letter arrives—how earnest!\nAre there not worthy men in all directions?\nYet a thousand *li* away, I still think of old friends.\nHaving seen much of the world, I know what to accept or reject,\nLong familiar with human nature, I discern closeness and distance.\nNow I grow old, content in decline,\nOffering no aid to this bright age, I recline by the Luo’s banks.\n\n**\"Long and Short Chant\"**\nThe noble person delights in sincerity,\nThe petty person delights in deception.\nSincerity endures through the years,\nDeception fades with the days and months.\n\n**\"Delusion and Awakening Chant\"**\nThe noble person corrects faults,\nThe petty person conceals wrongs.\nCorrecting faults leads to awakening,\nConcealing wrongs leads to delusion.\nAwakening brings fortune,\nDelusion invites disaster.\n\n**\"Rectifying Nature Chant\"**\nBefore birth,\nOne knows not how it is.\nAfter birth,\nOne knows there is heaven.\nHaving come from heaven,\nNature is rectified in all things.\nThe noble person fulfills their form,\nThe petty person trifles with life.\n\n**\"Light and Darkness Chant\"**\nLight has sun and moon,\nDarkness has ghosts and spirits.\nSun and moon illuminate things,\nGhosts and spirits depend on people.\nLight is revealed through things,\nDarkness is declared by people.\nIf people and things do not act,\nHow can light and darkness be distinguished?\n\n**\"No Shame Chant\"**\nHaving witnessed events,\nHaving tempered things—\nBetween heaven and earth,\nI move without shame.\n\n**\"Affairs Chant\"**\nSpeech must be measured,\nPrinciple values what is fitting.\nWhat can be changed should be reconsidered thrice,\nWhat must be done should be pondered again.\n\n**\"Self and Others Chant\"**\nBorn after heaven and earth,\nThe heart exists before them.\nHeaven and earth emerge from me—\nWhat more is there to say?\n\n**\"Four Permissible Things Chant\"**\nWhat can be striven for: conduct,\nWhat can be trusted: words,\nWhat can be entrusted: fate,\nWhat can be relied upon: heaven.\n\n**\"Four Impermissible Things Chant\"**\nWords must not be reckless,\nConduct must not falter,\nFate must not be neglected,\nHeaven must not be defied.\n\n**\"Renting a House Chant\"**\nA new house brings joy to its dwellers,\nA dilapidated one makes them wish to leave.\nIf the master keeps it well-maintained,\nWhat time is not fit to live?\n\n**\"The Petty Person\"**\nThe petty person has no shame,\nValues profit, scorns death,\nFears no human punishment,\nCares not for others’ judgment.\n\n**\"Reflection\"**\nTheir bones are bright,\nTheir spirit clear,\nTheir blessings meager,\nTheir fortune light.\n\n**\"Illness\"**\nThe body is like a kingdom,\nWhen ill, one must seek a physician.\n\n*Yichuan Jirang Ji*, Scroll Nineteen concludes.\n\n**\"Recovery\"**\nWhen illness fades, medicine finds its rightful place,\nModeration and release bring proper harmony.\n\n**\"Second Month Chant\"**\nBeneath the trees, no other knowledge remains,\nOnly the appointed time of the second month.\nWine is tasted when newly brewed,\nFlowers are admired at half-bloom.\nThere is only the joy of intoxication,\nNo sorrow of reckless abandon.\nWho can preserve this scene,\nAnd store it forever in heart and spleen?\n\n**\"Third Month Chant\"**\nAll day through the city, spring’s departure is pursued,\nYet those who chase it know its numbered days.\nDoes the true Master ever fail to bring forth life?\nYet wanderers have no certainty to rely upon.\nPear blossoms, drenched in rain, dissolve into weeping,\nWillow fluff, stirred by wind, refuses to settle.\nA moment of clarity holds boundless good intent—\nAlas, such intent is hard to bestow.\n\n**\"First-Rank Chant\"**\nTo utter words of the first rank,\nOne must possess a mind of the first rank.\nTo become a person of the first rank,\nOne must perform deeds of the first rank.\n\n**\"All Things Chant\"**\nSuccess and failure must be left to fate,\nRise and decline each have their season.\nThough petty men indulge in endless desire,\nHow could the true Master permit partiality?\nThis fleeting joy,\nSoon turns to hollow sorrow.\nBehold: when spring departs,\nFor whom do the wanderers roam?\n\n**\"Luoyang Spring Chant\"**\nNo place in the four directions rivals Luoyang’s beauty,\nNo season in the year surpasses spring’s blossoms.\nIn beauty and bloom lies exquisite subtlety—\nYet who but the idle can receive such grace?\nLuoyang’s people are accustomed to rare blossoms,\nPeach and plum flowers scarcely count as flowers.\nOnly when the peonies burst into full glory\nDoes the entire city rejoice without end.\n\nPeach and plum flowers bloom, yet none pause to gaze—\nTheir season is but a prelude to the peony’s hour.\nWhen peonies bloom, wine’s price soars,\nAnd midnight finds revelers still abroad.\nTime refuses even a moment’s respite:\nNinety days of spring vanish once more.\nHow many fallen petals drift without refuge,\nHalf carried by streams, half swept by wind?\n\nSpring departs, flowers fade, the days grow long,\nSwallows chatter, orioles sing, each absorbed in their own haste.\nWhy do wanderers cease their comings and goings?\nThe green shade is no less rich than the red bloom.\nTen days, and the finest flowers are gone—\nPity the Green Emperor’s laborious craft.\nWanderers, do not despair of certainty:\nThe red bloom may not surpass the green.\n\nWhere, after all, does spring retreat?\nCountless spring grievances remain unvoiced.\nI would entrust the warbler to ask the reason,\nBut the cuckoo only cries, *\"Better to leave!\"*\n\nThe four seasons complete a year’s cycle,\nYet only spring reveals such splendid blossoms.\nTen thousand coins for wine are no extravagance—\nOnce the red bloom fades, will it ever return?\n\n**\"Self-Admonition\"**\nAt sixty-seven years,\nI live as a man of this world.\nFrom a land of central uprightness,\nMy body contains all things.\nBeyond heaven, no greater joy exists,\nWithin my breast, another spring abides.\n\n**\"Falling Flowers Chant\"**\nTen thousand purples, a thousand reds—everywhere they fly,\nA riverbank of peach and plum blossoms forms a careless path.\nAs fierce wind and torrential rain approach dusk,\nThe dancing pavilions and singing terraces grow sparse.\nFloating on water, how can they find stability?\nScattered along the wayside, they have no refuge.\nThe warbler need not speak many words—\nWith each passing moment, spring has already gone.\n\n**\"Late Spring Chant\"**\nFlowers bloom—spring is at its finest,\nFlowers fade—spring draws to a close.\nWho would have thought the cuckoo,\nStill able to cry, *\"Return!\"*\n\nSpring arrives, butterflies flutter in chaos,\nSpring departs, the cuckoo weeps.\nHow can it be as before,\nWhen the warm breeze first stirred?\n\nBirds do not comprehend human feeling,\nThey only know spring is ending.\nSometimes they call *\"Pour the wine!\"*\nSometimes they cry *\"Go home!\"*\n\n**\"Coin Chant\"**\nCalled \"spring and cloth,\" yet footless, they traverse the world.\nDifficult to speak of their virtuous issuance,\nThey can open faces that never smile.\nThey repay the small debt of a life extended,\nThey relieve urgent needs like the great elixir.\nOnly the old men of Shang Mountain,\nCannot be bought with them—leisure.\n\n**\"Peony Chant\"**\nOne hue, one fragrance—yet the fragrance is celestial,\nThe color unlike all others.\nThe true Master’s craftsmanship is exquisite—\nNot something human intent can fathom.\n\n**\"In Memory of Academician Zhang Zihou of Fengxiang\"**\nHalf the realm of Qin’s mountains and rivers,\nNurturing genius through the ages.\nHow many worthies have graced the past?\nWhat era has lacked men to revive its pure wind?\n\n**\"Self-Conduct Chant\"**\nHow does Yaofu conduct himself?\nThe entire city of Luoyang feels like home.\nHaving no virtue to set myself apart,\nI follow things with utmost sincerity—nothing more.\nBefore my eyes, I see only the web of heaven’s offices,\nWho notices the changing years above my head?\nNot only does spring come and go—\nWithin my breast, the four seasons’ flowers always bloom.\n\n**\"Being Human Chant\"**\nTo be human, one must join the human throng;\nWithout joining, one cannot fulfill humanity.\nGreat Shun differed not from others,\nEven Emperor Yao’s kin followed proper order.\nA heart at odds brings illness to the body,\nHarmony in affairs brings spring to the four seas.\nThe heart governs the four limbs—it is the master,\nYet the limbs are even farther from the self.\n\n**\"Primordial Chant\"**\nWho undertakes the work of the Primordial?\nHow does one speak of it, and to whom?\nIf the Primordial can be spoken of,\nWhat lies beyond ruler and subject, father and son?\nThe tricks before our eyes are plain to all,\nThe work within the heart is unknown to the world.\nHeaven, earth, and self are but shifts in position—\nThis body differs not from Fu Xi’s.\n\n**\"Central Harmony Chant\"**\nNature has no other secret—\nOne must recognize central harmony.\nFew words in the heart,\nMany affairs in the world.\nLike timely rain ending a long drought,\nLike medicine reviving one from deep illness.\nIf one thing remains unresolved,\nHow can one manage the ten thousand things?\n\n**\"Four Worthies Chant\"**\nYanguo’s words unfold in rich detail,\nHuishu’s words are concise and apt,\nJunshi’s words flow with ease,\nBochun’s words are both measured and stirring.\nThe four worthies of Luoyang’s gaze,\nStood above all others.\nIn the Xining era of the Great Song,\nThey were the splendor of their time.\n\n**\"Old Age Chant\"**\nThe passing years no longer startle my head,\nOnly my friends’ eyes grow clearer.\nBright moon often viewed from my seat,\nDeep wine not poured for sorrow.\nIf my heart lacks foresight,\nI remain but a youth in the world.\nWhom shall I invite as companion?\nA light boat drifting on rivers and lakes.\n\n**\"Heaven and Earth Chant\"**\nBetween heaven and humanity, how can a needle’s point intrude?\nWhy seek distant truths when the highest principle is near?\nWhen baleful flames rage, they burn all the fiercer,\nWhere grace flows, it soaks all the deeper.\n\n**\"Long March Chant\"**\nThe long-marching soldier yearns for home,\nThe parched people long for rain like thirsting souls.\nFortune and misfortune turn as swiftly as a palm’s flip—\nCould one lie awake at midnight without a sigh?\n\n**\"On the Highest Principle\"**\nAmong the myriad things, humans are called most precious,\nYet sages rise above the people like stars apart.\nA steadfast stone needs no doubt to endure the day,\nBut to know the subtle signs before harm—how few are so divine!\nWithout resolve and courage, good cannot be achieved;\nWith keen discernment, purity is still more prized.\nFortune and misfortune show their signs by gradual steps—\nNot by heaven or earth, but by human hands alone.\n\n**\"Ode to Human Jade\"**\nJade does not value itself—people value it;\nYet why should human worth yield to jade’s purity?\nSo flawless and fair, ever constant and true,\nIts inner light and outer gleam both reveal its essence.\nThough fame may first lie hidden in the stone,\nOnly human hands can carve it into treasure.\nThe ancients are gone and cannot be seen again,\nYet the words of the humble-robed sage were not amiss.\n\n**\"On Deceit\"**\nThe deceitful distrust all others,\nFor the world runs on deceit.\nIf one trusts no one in the world,\nThen no truth remains in speech.\n\n**\"Drinking Wine\"**\nNow and then, a sip of fine wine,\nNurturing heaven’s harmony in place of tea.\nWithout rain, the year turns to dire famine,\nAnd the city’s burden holds no prosperous life.\nDwelling in fields, one must still care for the realm;\nEntrusting affairs to kin, one must still tend the home.\nIf asked what progress age has brought,\nI see only silver added to my temples in the mirror.\n\n**\"On the Joy of Things\"**\nThings have sound, color, scent, and taste;\nHumans have ears, eyes, mouth, and nose.\nAll the world’s things reside within one body—\nLook inward, and nothing is lacking.\n\n**\"Five Poems on Wang Anzhi’s Small Garden\"**\n\n**The Small Garden**\nThe small garden, newly repaired, stays close to home,\nRising to the hill’s crest, descending to the moat.\nLuoyang’s land seems favored beyond compare,\nAnd Tianjin’s visitors arrive without delay.\nIt may rival Penglai’s immortal gardens,\nBut let it not vie with Peach Blossom Spring’s praise.\nI hear a pavilion here grows many herbs—\nYet still lacks the famed *zǐhèchē*.\n\n**The Wild Pavilion**\nA pavilion named \"Wild,\" far from the dusty world,\nWhere Song and Shaos’ misty peaks send gentle winds.\nDays and months, years and seasons—all belong to me;\nWhere else could one seek the realm within the gourd?\n\n**The Humble Pavilion**\nXu You’s plan was not so profound—\nWashing his ears was not as good as stilling his heart.\nHere, one feels as if beyond the world,\nWhere no affairs intrude.\n\n**The Medicinal Pavilion**\nMountain herbs, though many, few can name;\nThe master transplants them and marks each one.\nIf they can truly cure the world’s ills,\nWhy shun the red and purple blooms near the eaves?\n\n**The Evening Glow Pavilion**\nThe high pavilion, newly built, brushes the clouds and mist—\nHow fine that it can hold the fading light!\nNear the path where spring admirers come and go,\nWho now lingers here among the wanderers?\n\n**\"Observing Things\"**\nWater brings rain, fire brings dew,\nEarth brings mist, stone brings hail.\nWater’s wind is cool, fire’s wind is hot,\nEarth’s wind is mild, stone’s wind is sharp.\nWater’s clouds are black, fire’s clouds are red,\nEarth’s clouds are yellow, stone’s clouds are white.\nWater’s thunder rumbles, fire’s thunder crackles,\nEarth’s thunder rolls, stone’s thunder crashes.\n\n**\"Painting Sleep\"**\nDaytime slumber is no easy art,\nFitting even for the age of Fuxi.\nWith a heart free of care after a full meal,\nOne may stroll at leisure, wrapped in quiet.\nBefore noon, orioles trill among the courtyard boughs;\nBy dusk, few visitors tread the flower-lined path.\nBehold the world’s many troubled souls—\nThough their pillows and mats may be cool, they lack this peace.\n\n**\"On Advancing and Retreating\"**\nAdvance and retreat—both paths are called guests;\nWhy trouble the seat with endless debate?\nLower your brows when seated, attending to all;\nSwing your arms when walking, heedless of others.\nTeeth and hair now decline, no longer youth’s days,\nYet in forests and streams, age brings eternal spring.\nDoes anyone know the one who acts without care?\nFor how could favor or disgrace ever reach such a person?\n\n**\"As a Guest\"**\nSuddenly I recall my days as a guest in southern Qin,\nGazing east from Luoyang, blocked by the Qin plains.\nClouds and mountains lie two thousand *li* away,\nNineteen years have passed since then.\nWillow hues—are they not newly graceful?\nRiver sounds—do they not still murmur as before?\nIf this frail body could return once more,\nHow could the feelings of old not fade into the distant past?\n\nSuddenly I recall my days as a guest in eastern Wu,\nWhere my youthful heart first saw the land of water and clouds.\nIsland barbarians dwelt near the wild frontiers,\nTides brought merchants mingling with the sea trade.\nLying down, I watched the vast ocean encircle the earth;\nSitting, I saw the red sun rise from Fusang.\nVain births, vain deaths—how many there are!\nYet the name of \"true man\" is not easily borne.\n\nSuddenly I recall my days as a guest in eastern Wu,\nWhen my spirit soared, delighting in travel.\nClimbing mountains, I never paused lightly,\nAnd never easily ceased with leftover wine.\nA thousand lotus stems perfumed the Chu plains,\nA soft wind filled the sail past Yangzhou.\nLooking back, it was like the dream of Handan—\nIn an instant, thirty autumns have passed.\n\nSuddenly I recall my days as a guest in Taiyuan,\nWhere autumn passed in drinking, yet I did not return.\nDistant mountains, nearby waters—all turned to sorrow,\nHigh towers in slanting sunlight—all became grief.\nYouth could not endure the sight of flowers,\nAnd with too much feeling, tears only stained my robes.\nNow, old in Luoyang’s walls,\nI no longer bear such sorrow in my brows.\n\n**\"Nurturing Life\"**\nGrasp firmly like an infant,\nBreathe strongly like a warrior.\nNeither comes naturally—\nBoth require great effort.\nThe heart is the body’s master,\nThe will is the *qi*’s commander.\nSink the pearl into the deep abyss,\nNurture your own heaven and earth.\n\n**\"Illness\"**\nYaofu was ill for three months,\nWorrying the people of Luoyang.\nNot just friends’ concern,\nBut as if for kin.\nRecommending doctors with earnest hearts,\nSeeking medicine with deep care.\nHow can I repay such kindness as before,\nVisiting their doors to express my thanks?\n\n**\"Severe Illness\"**\nFifty years of peace and joy,\nThen suddenly struck by grave illness.\nStill in the height of summer,\nI lay abed for hundreds of days.\nAcupuncture, moxibustion, and medicines—\nA hundred treatments, yet none took effect.\nI entrust my fate to heaven,\nWhat loss is there in my heart?\n\n**\"Heaven and Humanity\"**\nHeaven gives this body, entrusted to human effort;\nWhen human effort is exhausted, heaven’s decree arrives.\nHeaven and humanity are not a hair’s breadth apart—\nIf even a hair’s breadth exists, they become two.\n\n**\"At Death’s Door\"**\nWith fate, even in peril one does not die;\nWithout fate, even the best medicine is useless.\nOnly entrust one’s fate to heaven—\nBeyond that, who can idly calculate?\n\n**\"Entrusting to Heaven\"**\nHeaven gives me life,\nHeaven takes me in death.\nI entrust all to heaven—\nWhat is there that cannot be?\n\n**\"Obtaining the One\"**\nHeaven naturally obtains the One—there is no \"after\";\nI obtain the One only after it comes from Heaven.\nOnly Heaven and the One are without duality—\nHow could I ever differ from Heaven?\n\n**\"Answering a Guest’s Inquiry About My Illness\"**\nThe world values gold above all,\nYet I alone delight in poetry.\nLife and death are one and the same,\nWhile

plans are difficult, effort is spent,\nWhere things come easily, direction is spared.\nTo conceal yet reveal—such things are many—\nI do not love to write poetry.\n\nI do not love to write poetry—\nPoetry is when I am pleased.\nObserve the subtleties within things,\nDiscern the nuances among men.\nThe subtleties within things are seen before the eyes,\nThe nuances among men are known within the heart.\nYet this is gold no market can buy—\nI do not love to write poetry.\n\nI do not love to write poetry—\nPoetry is when I am not forced.\nWhen forced, affairs leave traces,\nTo know when to stop is to grasp the first sign.\nBefore you lies good farmland,\nIs there no level path in the world?\nMany avoid what is effortless—\nI do not love to write poetry.\n\nI do not love to write poetry—\nPoetry is when I am pleased.\nHow can this feeling be put into words?\nThis joy can only be pursued with delight.\nThe bearing of immortals is seen in leisure,\nThe work of the true master is

do not love to write poetry.\n\nI do not love to write poetry—\nPoetry is when I defy old age.\nTeeth fading, I meet the new year,\nEyes bright, I see old friends again.\nJoy wanes with each passing day,\nMy drinking capacity weakens too.\nSixty-seven years a man of no affairs—\nI do not love to write poetry.\n\nI do not love to write poetry—\nPoetry is when I move with caution.\nSeeking fame

peaches, plums, pears, and dates,\nLocated in the western outskirts of Wei.\nI have tended it for over ten years,\nYet never once stayed to watch the flowers bloom—\nSuch is the way of men.\nLast winter, I fell ill and returned from the capital.\nThis spring, I first noticed the flowers’ lushness,\nAnd lamented my own straitened circumstances.\nThus, I wrote a set of poems on the spring countryside.\nThough they may not meet refined tastes,\nThey at least give voice to my feelings.\nThe year *Qingli Dinghai*.\n\n**1. Dwelling in the Spring Countryside**\nThough my home lies near the city walls,\nI do not wish to enter the town.\nAll day, no guests arrive,\nBy night, the gate remains shut.\nThe courtyard is still, spring at its peak,\nThe window idle, I nap through the day.\nWho knows that among coarse fare,\nThere is the savor of poetry and books?\n\n**2. Strolling in the Spring Countryside**\nRecovered from illness, I am startled by spring,\nStaff in hand, I view the wilds anew.\nBy the water, I meet a fisherman,\nOn the ridge, I see a plowman.\nI ask of their hardships,\nThey speak of their meager livelihoods.\nI am ashamed my strength cannot aid them,\nFailing to serve the people.\n\n**3. Fragrant Grass in the Spring Countryside**\nThe spring wind must have a blade,\nSevering my heart’s tender threads.\nIf the spring wind has no blade,\nWho trims the fragrant grass?\nOnce severed, the heart cannot rejoin,\nYet the grass, though cut, grows again.\nWho has fragrant wine?\nSing for me, and I will drink.\n\n**4. Flowers Blooming in the Spring Countryside**\nPeaches and plums spread their fragrance,\nThick blossoms cover my humble hut.\nTheir sweet scent drifts through the lattice,\nPetals scatter on the front steps.\nI circle them after my midday rest,\nPluck them lightly in my spring drunkenness.\nThough I gaze all day,\nWho would fault my wild neglect?\n\n**5. Cold Food Festival in the Spring Countryside**\nFlowers bloom thickly beyond the city walls,\nI did not expect such splendor to fade.\nFortunate not to be within the walls,\nI do not see the city’s finery.\nThe weather is neither cold nor warm,\nThe day half-clouded, half-clear.\nBeyond the flowers, swings creak,\nThe moon rises beyond the swings.\n\n**6. Evening View in the Spring Countryside**\nWarm winds stir the singing birds,\nThe sky hangs low with thin clouds.\nMist gathers over the winding ridges,\nRain threatens the river’s heart.\nWillows veil the distant city,\nFlowers hide the old county town.\nI alone pity my ailing body,\nStill permitted to seek the late spring.\n\n**7. Rain in the Spring Countryside**\nThe nine wilds stretch endlessly,\nDusk lingers on the crow’s path.\nSeated, I lose sight of distant trees,\nBeyond the gate, the front hills vanish.\nRaincoat-clad farmers rejoice,\nSheltered dwellers idle.\nThe poet’s melancholy deepens,\nYet the sky’s mood begins to lift.\n\n**8. After the Rain in the Spring Countryside**\nThe rain ceases, sweeping away lingering spring,\nHeaven’s light reveals its purest truth.\nA soft carpet of fragrant grass,\nFlowers washed bright as brocade.\nThe wind stirs the oriole’s song,\nMist smooths the willow’s sash.\nHow can I face such a scene,\nAnd idly lie through this prosperous time?\n\n**9. Old Wine in the Spring Countryside**\nFlowers bloom after wind and rain,\nI endure illness, seeking solace.\nThis is not the height of carefree abandon,\nBut what can one do in exhaustion?\nSwallows dart among the rafters,\nWild geese vanish beyond the sky.\nAll is ashen in my heart,\nSilently, the noon hour passes.\n\n**10. Fallen Flowers in the Spring Countryside**\nLate spring brings wind and rain,\nPetals scatter across the rear garden.\nAt dawn, remnants cling in clusters,\nIn sunlight, crimson flutters in disarray.\nThe fragrant path cannot retain their wrappings,\nTheir delicate hearts refuse further play.\nPeach and plum, though they make the trail,\nLie in silent, tangled ruin.\n\n**To Yang Xuan**\nThe Qi River runs clear and bright,\nIts spring welling from my land.\nWhen its waters reach your home,\nAll is but longing for you.\n\n*The Twentieth Scroll of the Yichuan Ji Rang Collection concludes*\n*(The \"Guanghe Yaofu Shouwei Yin\" and the following sixteen prose-poem pieces were absent in the original Daoist Canon edition; now supplemented from the Wenyuan Pavilion text.)*",

What resides in the heart is *zhi* (aspiration); when spoken, it becomes poetry. When emotions stir within and take form in words, and sounds coalesce into patterns, we call this *yin* (music). Thus, to harbor the times is to call it *zhi*; to be moved by things is to call it *qing* (emotion). To give voice to *zhi* is to call it *yan* (speech); to elevate *qing* is to call it *sheng* (sound). When speech forms a composition, it is called poetry; when sound forms patterns, it is called music. Thereafter, by hearing one’s poetry and listening to one’s music, the *zhi* and *qing* of a person may be known.\n\nNow, emotions are seven in number, but their essence lies in two: the self and the times. As for the self, it concerns the fortunes and misfortunes of the individual; as for the times, it concerns the prosperity or decline of the age. The fortunes and misfortunes of the self extend no further than poverty or wealth, nobility or lowliness. The prosperity or decline of the times rests with the rise and fall, order and chaos of the realm.\n\nThus, when Confucius edited the *Book of Poetry*, he discarded nine-tenths of it. Of the over a thousand states of the feudal lords, only fifteen were selected for the *Airs*; of the twelve kings of the Western Zhou, only six were chosen for the *Odes*. This was because the Way of transmitting instruction lies in making clear what is good and what is evil, and only the most salient examples were preserved.\n\nIn recent times, poets, when afflicted by hardship, devote themselves to resentment and indignation; when favored with prosperity, they indulge in excess and dissipation. The fortunes and misfortunes of the self manifest in joy and anger; the prosperity or decline of the times arise from love and aversion. Rarely do they speak with the great righteousness of the world in mind. Thus, their poetry is largely submerged in personal predilections.\n\nAlas! The drowning power of emotion is greater than that of water. The ancients said that water can bear a boat, but it can also capsize it. Whether it bears or capsizes depends on the water, not on the person. When it bears, it brings benefit; when it capsizes, it brings harm. Thus, benefit and harm lie with the person, not with the water. But does the bearing or capsizing determine a person’s benefit or harm, or do benefit and harm determine the bearing or capsizing? Between the two, there must be a proper course.\n\nIt is like a person treading water: it is the person who treads the water, not the water that treads the person. Yet even those praised for their skill in treading water have never escaped being harmed by it. If one treads water for external gain, then the nature of water follows the nature of the person. If one treads water for internal gain, then the peril of ruin stands immediately before them. In such cases, what need is there to distinguish between person and water? The injury to one’s nature and the harm to one’s life are one and the same.\n\nNature is the embodiment of the Dao. If nature is injured, the Dao follows. The heart is the outer enclosure of nature. If the heart is injured, nature follows. The body is the dwelling of the heart. If the body is injured, the heart follows. Things are the vessels of the body. If things are injured, the body follows.\n\nThus, to observe nature through the Dao, the heart through nature, the body through the heart, and things through the body—this is governance. Yet even so, one has not escaped harm. It is better to observe the Dao through the Dao, nature through nature, the heart through the heart, the body through the body, and things through things. Then, even if one wished to inflict harm, how could it be achieved?\n\nIf this is so, then to observe the family through the family, the state through the state, and the world through the world—this principle may likewise be understood.\n\nFrom my youth, I devoted myself to the teachings of the Confucians, believing that the joys of the human world scarcely amounted to one ten-thousandth of what they could be, while the joys of the *mingjiao* (teachings of names and rituals) were boundless. Moreover, the joys of observing things were also boundless. Though life and death, honor and disgrace battled before me, they never entered my heart—how were they different from the four seasons, wind and flowers, snow and moon, passing before one’s eyes?\n\nTruly, this is the ability to observe things as things, so that neither harms the other. For in this state, the entanglements of emotion are entirely forgotten; the only thing not forgotten is poetry. Yet though it is said not to be forgotten, in truth, it is as if forgotten. Why? Because what I compose differs from what others compose.\n\nMy compositions know no bounds; their rhythms and meters are not [restricted]; love and aversion are not established. Thus, they do not seek fame or reputation, but respond like a mirror to a reflection, like a bell to a sound. Occasionally, in the leisure after cultivating the Dao, I observe the times in tranquility, reflect upon things in stillness, rouse my aspirations in accord with the times, lodge words in things, give voice to aspirations in song, form poetry from words, give sound to song, and create music from poetry.\n\nThus, though there is sorrow, it never wounds; though there is joy, it never indulges. Though it is said to chant and sing of emotions and nature, how could it ever burden nature and emotion?\n\nBells and drums are music; jade and silk are ritual. To be addicted to bells, drums, jade, and silk—such words cannot avoid being vulgar. Yet to abolish bells, drums, jade, and silk—what then becomes of ritual and music?\n\nSome say that the Way of the *Airs* and *Odes* flourished in antiquity but not in the present—this is hardly a comprehensive view. It is the speech of those constrained by their own circumstances.\n\nAlas! Do they not consider that those who do good in the world are few, while those who harm the good are many; that those who create peril are numerous, while those who uphold peril are few? When a man of aspiration dwells in the fields, he speaks of the fields. Thus, his poetry is named the *Yichuan Clod-Pounding Collection*.\n\nWritten on the Mid-Autumn Festival of the *bingwu* year of the *Zhiping* era of the Song Dynasty.\n\n---\n\n**Volume One of *Yichuan’s Clod-Pounding Collection***\n**Shao Yong (Yaofu) of Yichuan**",

the subtle shifts confess.\n\nAn endless thirst for triumph burns,\nA will to lead that never turns.\nThough seated face to face as host and guest,\nThey meet like strangers, savage and unblessed.\n\nWealth stirs the heart, its fire untamed,\nJoy, wrath—each passion plainly named.\nLife and death lie in their hands,\nGain and loss upon their lips command.\n\nHarmony shatters like ice and flame,\nNo flute and pipe their discord tame.\nNo bond of friendship here is known,\nNo love between a wife and husband shown.\n\nPearls and jade from sleeves they draw,\nDragons, serpents writhe and gnaw.\nWalls of bronze rise from the board,\nSwords and halberds clash, the air is scored.\n\nBy day they summon ghosts and gods,\nOn level ground, the dragons plod.\nEmpty rivers roar with hail and thunder,\nLand and sea see leviathans sunder.\n\nCold and heat in equal sway,\nLight and dark alternate day.\nMountains, rivers gleam like jewels bright,\nStars and spheres align in cosmic sight.\n\nWatching fortunes ebb and flow,\nI startle at the paths of weal and woe.\nHigh and low shift with ease,\nYet reversal’s grip none can appease.\n\nHeart and deed stand sundered wide,\nGain and harm cannot abide.\nFold or spread—know the hour,\nTake or leave—seize the power.\n\nThe cunning drown in their own deceit,\nThe trusting fall to blunt deceit.\nTruth and falsehood twist and blend,\nName and substance meet their end.\n\nVictory is loss’s root,\nFortune climbs on misfortune’s boot.\nHeaven and Earth in strife engage,\nFire and Water turn the page.\n\nBows and arrows clash in might,\nWords and taunts ignite the fight.\nWhat game lacks win or loss?\nWhat age escapes rise and toss?\n\nWhat once was right may now be wrong,\nWhat seems so strong may soon be gone.\nViewing past through present’s eye,\nNot just Fu Xi’s age meets the sky.\n\nYao and Shun bowed in graceful yield,\nYet Four Fiends lurked in the field.\nTang and Wu took up the blade,\nTwo Elders’ reproach did not fade.\n\nThough Gao Yao spoke with wisdom’s grace,\nYi Yin and Zhou’s counsel held their place.\nYet even then, the cure brought pain,\nMending bone while flesh was slain.\n\nBenevolence fell to fame’s deceit,\nRighteousness was crushed by gain’s deceit.\nOrder, chaos—none stand still,\nChange and reform bend to time’s will.\n\nFavor the worthy, not the son,\nYet flaw and folly still are spun.\nFavor the son, not the wise,\nAnd scions bear the wounds’ device.\n\nSome, like Miao, defied command,\nSome, like Youhu, barred the land.\nYi stirred the strife’s first spark,\nGuan and Cai spread doubt’s dark mark.\n\nThe Shang marched on Ge’s domain,\nThe Zhou struck Li’s domain.\nAt Mingtiao, banners flew,\nAt Muye, standards fell anew.\n\nThe sun that lit Xia’s prison bright\nOnce shone on Sheng’s flight.\nWho knows if moonlight’s gentle ray,\nOn Mengshi’s path did not hold sway?\n\nKing Li fled to Zhi,\nKing You died at Li.\nKing Ping moved to Luo,\nKing Nan fell at Yi.\n\nSome pledged at Shaoling’s plain,\nSome met at Huangchi’s main.\nSome fought at Chang’an’s shore,\nSome slew at Ganxi’s door.\n\nSome entered Yan and Ying,\nSome fled to Kuaiji’s ring.\nSome razed Daliang’s pride,\nSome stormed Linzi’s side.\n\nFive Hegemons devoured all,\nSeven States lashed with scornful maul.\nCruel Qin crushed the Six Lands,\nChu and Han clashed for command.\n\nHeaven ends where the sun still gleams,\nEarth fades where no bound remains.\nFar and near, all is embraced,\nLength and breadth, all is traced.\n\nFields in grids once stretched wide,\nArmor piled in endless tide.\nThen came roads to cleave the land,\nBorders drawn with ruthless hand.\n\nWeapons melted, sharp and keen,\nBooks and poems burned unseen.\nLords dismissed, prefects installed,\nTrunk strengthened, branches maimed and galled.\n\nHeavy troops garrisoned Shang,\nThe Great Wall choked the frontier’s song.\nThey boasted of their rock-like might,\nA reign to last through endless night.\n\nYet with a flick of fate’s own hand,\nThey ceded land where they did stand.\nViewed men as ants in scornful gaze,\nSpent wealth like sand in reckless haze.\n\nE’pang Palace stood unfinished still,\nThe First Emperor’s cart reached Xi.\nBefore the tomb’s last stone was laid,\nChen She’s troops rose from Qi’s glade.\n\nAt Ba Shang, hearts ran deep,\nAt Hong Gate, tempers seethe.\nXianyang’s smoke rose to the sky,\nNanzheng’s flames burned on high.\n\nMen and ghosts in chaos twined,\nWind and clouds in sorrow joined.\nXiang’s might, Liu’s strength yet vied,\nWho would claim the deer denied?\n\nThree Chapters’ law stood fast,\nFive States’ troops followed at last.\nTemple schemes weighed deep and wise,\nTent-bound plans won swift surprise.\n\nAt Guangwu, rage burned bright,\nAt Honggou, beasts fought in fright.\nXingyang mourned Ji Xin’s ruse,\nGaixia bid Yu Ji adieu.\n\nThree Heroes’ talents then took flight,\nA thousand years shone with new light.\nOld rivers kept their storied grace,\nNew sun and moon lit heaven’s face.\n\nThree Systems’ calendar aligned,\nChariots and script in one design.\nNo lands were sundered, far or wide,\nThe distant held in bonds of pride.\n\nYet royal kin vied for the throne,\nArmies split to North and South alone.\nHad no great ministers stood tall,\nWho then could save the empire’s fall?\n\nA century passed in fleeting sun,\nLong wars shook the vaulted one.\nWho knew the witchcraft’s dark design,\nWould rise from Liu Qu’s tangled line?\n\nThe steward held the scales with care,\nBright and clear, he met despair.\nSeeing peril, he gave his life,\nNo shame to the orphan’s strife.\n\nBandits mocked the orphan’s plight,\nActing like fox and raccoon in night.\nPalace halls saw widows weep,\nThrone rooms chased the infant deep.\n\nDragon wars—where did they lead?\nIce stood firm in time of need.\nThough the dike may break and flood,\nWho dares forget the dike’s true good?\n\nEastern Han saw dawn’s last glow,\nAt Kunyang, tiles flew in the blow.\nWang Mang’s ghost in sorrow sighed,\nOn Jiantai’s steps, corpses piled.\n\nAt Hao, they chased the high-nosed king,\nAt Xin’an, Red Eyebrows’ sting.\nFire’s virtue ruled once more,\nHan’s court restored its ancient lore.\n\nDou and Deng rose from the hearth,\nYan and Liang grasped the hen’s worth.\nWhat use were Jing’s labors vast,\nWhen Dong’s deeds left all aghast?\n\nYellow River ran with scarce a flame,\nThe capital choked with thistle and bramble.\nLong skies saw crows take flight,\nWhite bones drew no pity’s light.\n\nMoats cried out to be refilled,\nNo blood left for the sheep to yield.\nA great house nears its fall,\nNo single beam can prop it all.\n\nMengde struck first with daring hand,\nZhongmou rode his father’s land.\nXuande’s ambition met no end,\nYet tears were all he could expend.\n\nWestern Jin prized empty talk,\nGreat plans hung on rank and mark.\nWomen held the reins of state,\nKin turned to plague and hate.\n\nTwo Lords bore frost and dew,\nFive Hu defiled the sacred vessel true.\nNo Guan Yiwu stood in sight,\nMen longed for Xian Huan’s might.",

timeliness;\nWhy not seek a fine office?\nAbove, you would eat the Son of Heaven’s salary,\nBelow, succor the remnant of the common folk.\nOn thoroughfares, you would raise grand mansions,\nBeyond the city walls, broad fertile fields.\nCrimson gates ablaze with gold and purple,\nGreen towers thick with pipes and strings.\nIn your outer stables, fat and noble steeds stand arrayed,\nIn your rear chambers, delicate beauties gather.\nEntering, you sit in a lofty hall;\nExiting, you ride in a splendid carriage.\nHow resplendent your cap and sword,\nHow composed your bearing and ease.\nYou would discourse on the affairs of the realm,\nIn a vast assembly, your words would kindle bright mist.\nNone would dare lift their gaze to you,\nAll would hold their breath, awaiting your countenance.\nThis is what is called a true man—\nHis ambition may be seen and known.\nWhy then must you afflict yourself,\nYour form and visage like a withered eel?\nYou trace the deeds of the ancients,\nGleaning from the volumes they left behind,\nYet before a single ditch of water you linger,\nEnamored of a few stalks of bamboo.\nThis is what is called a common fellow—\nWhat lofty integrity is there to aspire to?\"\n\nI dared reply to my guest:\n\"Affairs are not so easily explained.\nIt is not that I delight in ragged hemp,\nNor that my mouth loathes rare delicacies.\nHow could I not know the gourd’s

not concur.\nThe Way’s rise and fall, its bending and stretching,\nAdvance and retreat, its timing and precedence—\nIf one does not follow this principle,\nWhen the jade is shattered, whose fault is it?\nIf the Dao remains unfulfilled,\nIts mandate lies with Heaven.\n\nOf late, I wandered through the Three Cities,\nLingering still in hesitation.\nThe renowned ministers of this age\nDeigned to extend me special courtesy.\nSome, in the clear night, discoursed on the Dao;\nOthers, by the rear pond, set boats adrift.\nFor several evenings, gatherings of literature and wine—\nBoundless was the joy.\nBeyond the cold of the tenth month,\nBefore the myriad leaves under hoarfrost,\nI returned to my walled dwelling,\nTo sleep drunk beneath the bamboo window in the bright sun.\n\nI raise my gaze

debating merit,\nFive men of other surnames were enfeoffed as kings.\nNone matched the might of Huaiyin,\nWho dared to root out the Qin’s resurgence.\n\n**VIII**\nHan Xin relied on merit, foresaw little,\nThe Han emperor owed him virtue yet clung to power.\nTo imprison and execute him was no great feat,\nYet such cruelty was needless.\n\n**IX**\nIf glory is seized violently, so too is

      "translated_text": "**From the Five Spring Excursions (continued)**\n\n**II**\nWhose masterful tune flows from the Qiang flute?\nAll day, its pure fragrance lingers in the winecup.\nI imagine the wanderer far from home,\nStanding here too, lost in lingering steps.\n\n**III**\nThe spring hues of Luoyang stretch boundless,\nAnd east of the city, they grow yet more splendid.\nA gentle breeze sways a thousand willows,\nSoft ripples stir half the river’s blossoms.\nIn misty clarity, kingfishers glide over level banks;\nIn warming sun, mandarin ducks descend on shallow sands.\nLong have I not seen the sovereign’s western journey—\nNow travelers only sigh at their temples’ silvered frost.\n\n**IV**\nThe second month blooms in full radiance,\nYet the imperial banners have not come—spring drifts unmoored.\nBeneath green willows, I wander through every fragrant path;\nAmid red apricots, I return half-drunk with wine.\nA few fallen petals lure butterflies in chase;\nA slanting sunbeam hears the orioles’ song.\nWith clear cups and wine, my aged parents rejoice—\nStill, I may don motley robes and play before their steps.\n\n**V**\nThe finest festival under heaven is Cold Food Day,\nAnd the world’s most famed gardens lie in Luoyang.\nJingu’s warmth blends with palace halls’ emerald,\nBronze Camels gleam beneath silken radiance.\nBy the bridge, willows trail their slender threads to earth;\nBeyond the flowers, swings rise halfway up the walls.\nWhite horses tread lightly on grass like shears—\nFor over a decade, I’ve roamed here in delight.\n\n**VI**\nIn the third month, peonies burst into full bloom,\nAnd drumbeats rise wherever pavilions stand.\nLaughing girls in carriages exchange banter;\nBelow the towers, crowds drift by at leisure.\nRippling jade-green waves sway the curtains,\nWhile Shangyang’s floral breath fills the wine vessels.\nThis is the climate the Western Capital favors—\nYet now, who mourns the barren trees’ vain allure?\n\n---\n\n**Awakening in the Bamboo Courtyard**\nAwakening in the bamboo courtyard, I recline on the armrest,\nAs the languid summer day stretches long.\nOrioles just lead their fledglings, teaching tender tongues;\nApricots hang heavy, donning their pale gold.\nRaindrops break the quiet dream in fragments,\nWhile wind stirs distant thoughts into flight.\nA small channel plays with water in dense green shade—\nLooking back, I realize days have passed once more.\n\n---\n\n**Six Autumn Excursions**\n\n**I**\nIn the seventh month, lotuses blaze in full bloom,\nAnd I linger near the southeastern garden.\nSometimes the wind brushes the pond’s heart,\nBearing boundless fragrance from the water’s surface.\nMist-painted streams run deep—I wander lost;\nThe evening lake at Dongting has not yet brought me home.\nThen, a sudden shower whispers past—\nAnd fresh coolness arrives with my wine.\n\n**II**\nBefore autumn, the vast clarity stirs in secret,\nAnd Luoyi now knows the season’s balance.\nCourtyards turn cool—people rejoice together;\nGardens, washed by rain, grow even clearer.\nTurning the boat on Yi River, the breeze drifts gently;\nReining the horse at Tianjin Bridge, the moon shines bright.\nThe sages’ thoughts divide like Gao and Kui—\nLet poetry and wine celebrate this peaceful age.\n\n**III**\nThe eighth month’s light is not yet bleak,\nAnd pine pavilions, bamboo groves suit it best.\nJust as day and night find their pause,\nThe balance of heat and chill arrives in due time.\nThe bright moon enters my heart as if with intent;\nA kindly breeze meets my face as if it knows me.\nIdle folk sing and chant in contentment,\nUnconcerned whether the court heeds their verse.\n\n**IV**\nMy home lies south of the city by water and bamboo,\nAnd autumn’s joys have never failed me.\nI love the mild chill of this season,\nWhile half-drunk, time slips by unnoticed.\nTrusting my horse on the imperial avenue after light rain,\nLeaning on the railing of a monk’s pavilion at dusk.\nFor ten years, I’ve chased every fair scene—\nNow, I ask the wind to whiten my temples.\n\n**V**\nThough the ninth month’s splendor wanes,\nThe Central Plain’s beauty is not yet spent.\nMy eyes take in autumn’s hues for a thousand *li*;\nMy hands hold two or three branches of yellow blossoms.\nFine wine easily dissolves idle years,\nBut bronze mirrors need not reflect my aging face.\nIf I must make others believe,\nWho would know the sincerity I’ve poured out?\n\n**VI**\nIn frosty skies, endless thoughts arise—\nI cannot bear the tower’s height, forcing my gaze.\nDistant mountains fill my sight in vain;\nThe autumn palace stands empty and aloof.\nClouds stretch over far peaks, a thousand *xun* straight;\nSunset scatters crimson threads through the sky.\nCountless sorrows cannot be spoken—\nWith whom can I open my heart to the west wind?\n\n---\n\n**An Autumn Day’s Occurrences**\nCrows clamor in the daytime woods—\nFor whom do they toil so bitterly?\nCrickets chirp through the nighttime courtyard—\nFor whom do they labor so ceaselessly?\nAlas, how brief their lives,\nYet they never rest.\nI ask: how long is this?\nThe two who forget speech and silence.\n\n---\n\n**On the Road to Mount Shang**\nTen lodgings bring me to Shangyan,\nThough distant, the journey is not harsh.\nEast and west, I trace the Luo River,\nGazing at Qin’s mountains within and beyond.\nBeyond the mist and rosy clouds, I am free—\nYet my heart remains with my parents.\nThe courtyard is not far—\nI can set a date for my return.\n\n---\n\n**Matching Magistrate Zhang Zihou’s Early Plum Blossoms**\nOnly the Queen Mother of the West could craft such lightness,\nSnipping the sky’s edge into scattered white clouds.\nEndless pure fragrance and pristine beauty—\nEven the fairest offerings at the winecup yield to you.\n\nPlums shade the spring stream, water winds around the hills,\nPlum blossoms dazzle as the brook murmurs.\nIn Nanzheng, the earth is warm, and they bloom early—\nBy the start of spring, they’ve already bloomed many times.\n\nA thousand flowers vie in succession,\nBut if one speaks of lofty standards, only the plum remains.\nI understand your intent in binding them—\nYou cherish their pure threads, letting them bloom first.\n\nFrost upholds their noble bearing, lifting it high;\nWind carries their cold fragrance far and wide.\nThe prefect is moved, the traveler is touched—\nGolden cups are drained in celebration.\n\n---\n\n**On the Road in Shang Mountains**\nFading embers, dim lamp, the night deepens,\nAs I silently ponder past affairs, wrapped in a cold quilt.\nA frosty sky, a bright moon—though a thousand *li* apart,\nIt cannot compare to the inch of heart grieving for the times.\n\n---\n\n**Matching Prefect Song of Shang’s Early Plum Blossoms**\nSouth of the mountains, the land is as warm as Lingnan,\nAnd in the twelfth month, plum blossoms have already bloomed for days.\nUnbending, they defy the common flowers’ ways,\nStanding apart from the crowd, claiming spring’s first light.\n\nFrom the horn, their notes drift, colder than bone;\nFrom the flute, their melody enters the spirit.\nA fair brow’s makeup fades, clinging to pale powder;\nA painted beam’s warmth stirs light dust.\nThe magistrate cherishes their beauty, offering them to the prefect;\nThe prefect shares their fragrance even with rustics.\nHolding a few branches, I inhale deeply—\nHow can I bear to let fine wine touch my lips?\n\n---\n\n**Matching a Friend’s Poem on Freeing the Heart**\nThough one may not foresee the future,\nWealth and rank, fame and achievement—are they truly won by force?\nTo cleanse the heart, nothing serves like wine;\nTo roam in ease, nothing compares to poetry.\nHere, amidst water, bamboo, clouds, and mountains,\nHow can I betray the seasons of wind, flowers, snow, and moon?\nA man’s grand ambitions lie in action or retreat—\nWhen, if not now, should I unknit my brows and smile?\n\n---\n\n**Matching Prefect of Shang’s Poem on Ascending the Tower to View Snow**",

in his breast idles in the hills.\nAffairs, seen through rise and fall of ages,\nReveal the Dao in ruler and minister’s advance and retreat.\nIf you harbor rare talent, rare use will find you—\nIf not, you must bear a lifetime’s leisure.\n\n---\n\n**Four Poems on the Temple of the Four White-Haired Ones**\n\n1.\nMighty Qin lost control, blood flowed wide,\nThe realm sought a lord, yet none could be found.\nJust when heroes locked horns in contest,\nWho knew into whose hands the deer would fall?\n\n2.\nThe true man of Bashang had already soared,\nThe four looked at one another, speechless.\nXu said, “Heaven’s mandate has its course—\nBetter to follow the tracks of Chao and Xu.”\n\n3.\nThe Han emperor’s pride could not bend them,\nOnly the crown prince’s humble words brought them forth.\nThough aged, they still achieved great deeds—\nTo this day, their lofty virtue shines like sun and stars.\n\n4.\nTian Heng fled to the sea and won renown,\nShang came to Chang’an, strong for a hundred *li*.\nOnly when the four were made to perfect their integrity\nDid one know Gaozu was a true king.\n\n---\n\n**Thanking Prefect of Shang, Song Langzhong, for Sending a Household Register for Mount Tianzhu, Following the Original Rhyme**\n\nA talisman from Shang flew here, fresh and new,\nFulfilling a bond beyond this life’s measure.\nMost joyous, the purple lingzhi first in hand—\nTianzhu in the southwest stands neighbor to heaven.\n\nMy first intent was to serve at the emperor’s side,\nBut spring’s Dipper turned in the capital’s circuit.\nNow to dwell beneath Tianzhu’s peak,\nNo fear of night travelers ahead.\n\nI do not present life and death to the august throne,\nBut embrace mist and haze, learning reclusion.\nMuch thanks to Magistrate Shi for leaving the right seat vacant,\nTo welcome once more a mountain man to Tianzhu.\n\nA cluster of mist and haze locks the drifting clouds,\nTianzhu’s lone height is fine for a true man’s perch.\nFrom now on, I make plans for a western return—\nWhy seek further fords among men?\n\n---\n\n**Four Poems on Mount Tianzhu**\n\n1.\nLong have I roamed with the deer, achieving nothing,\nYet deep is the grace of Magistrate Shi, who enrolled me.\nThrough ten thousand ages, name and surname endure—\nBound to Tianzhu’s peaks, they too shall remain.\n\n2.\nNo success, I’ve run with the herd of deer,\nBut your kindness runs deep, Magistrate, in granting me a register.\nThrough all time, name and fame persist—\nLet them abide with Tianzhu’s towering summits.\n\n---\n\n**To Prefect of Shang, Song Langzhong**\n\nReturning first to Luoyang, endless affairs await,\nA man of leisure, my place seems at odds.\nNow, at last, I feel ease and freedom,\nLike the carefree days on Shang’s slopes.\n\n---\n\n**Awakening from a Nap in the Small Garden**\n\nBeyond the gate, it seems a deep mountain,\nNature’s truth, truly, can be regained.\nBeyond the rush of caps and carriages,\nSun and moon pass in their course.\nThe garden’s waters flow with life,\nGrasses and trees idle in the windless air.\nSpring birds break my secluded dream,\nChattering on the branches, soft and sweet.\n\n---\n\n**Three Poems on Wandering the Mountains**\n\n1.\nLong confined in the city’s gates, my heart grows weary,\nThe moment I step beyond, my eyes brighten.\nI’ve seen all the sights of Dragon Gate on the Yi,\nListened to the last echoes of the Luo’s waters at Nüji.\nAt Mount Tai’s shrine, the red sun rises,\nFrom Heaven’s Altar, white clouds arise.\nThis body is already pledged to true companions—\nNot for trifles will I weigh gain or loss.\n\n2.\nSpring’s end is the perfect time for climbing,\nHuman feeling and heaven’s mood both harmonize.\nBoating on the Yi as the wind turns at night,\nFishing at the stream’s gate as the moon rises.\nMy carefree spirit soars, poetry runs wild,\nMy ailing frame relies on wine to sustain.\nFew are the days of this floating life—\nHow can I bear to furrow my brow between them?\n\n3.\nJoy is pursued, sorrow shunned—\nA true man knows fate.\nMinor deeds and fame are hard to secure,\nBut clouds and mountains bring me delight.\nFear not the distant mist and haze,\nWhile strength remains, ride it.\nBeyond enough, what joy is there?\nWealth and honor, once past, bring only grief.\n\n---\n\n**Two-Colored Peach Blossoms**\n\nRouge and powder both enhance their beauty,\nA dazzling charm to overthrow city and state.\nI suspect they are twin sisters from the Jewel Bud Realm,\nBoth willing at once to wed the spring wind.\n\n---\n\n**Composing Poems While Climbing Mountains and Facing Waters**\n\nMountains have towering peaks, waters have waves,\nNeither sandals nor boats can contain them.\nNot that wisdom and kindness lack joy in this,\nBut few who climb and face them shirk the toil.\nWords of taste know only sweet meats and roasts,\nWho speaks truly can recognize jade and jasper?\nI lament my failure to exhaust human talent—\nEver resenting how highly men judge today.\n\n---\n\n**Two Poems Thanking Grand Chancellor Fu for Summoning Me to Office**\n\n1.\nYour summons, much thanks, was not forgotten,\nThinking my breast held something to offer.\nIf I advanced, how could I bear official duties?\nAt leisure, why take a name in vain?\nThe messenger said, “If you do not wish to serve,\nYou may come and be granted a title of ease.”\nI wish to be like Chao and Xu, calling myself a subject,\nContent to grow old in the age of Yao and Shun.\n\n2.\nMy eyes are full of worthy men in court ranks,\nA sick man has no way to bind the realm’s fate.\nI wish to fulfill my plan to grow old in leisure,\nBut heaven’s intent remains unknown.\nHow many layers of carriages and caps repay the body’s worth?\nBetter to have clouds and mountains fill my gaze.\nFine scenes never fail to inspire verse,\nBut my bold heart has all dissolved away.\nThe swan and wild goose know the joys of rivers and lakes—\nWhy trouble with petty nets and snares?\n\n---\n\n**Responding to a Question on the Teachings of Names**\n\nSince the world’s beginning, teachings have spread,\nAmong them, the bold are called true Confucians.\nCultivating the self has its Dao—those who awaken first,\nWhat age has lacked men who grasped its mysteries?\nRadiant as cinnabar and ink, the meaning of classics and history,\nBright as sun and moon, the sage’s path.\nThough I, a humble student, have long immersed myself,\nHow dare I slander the world’s heroic talent?\n\n---\n\n**Seeing Off Academician Wang Bochu on His Mission to the Northern Capital**\n\nA man’s resolve is set when the coffin closes,\nHis grand designs weigh heavily.\nThe road ahead cannot be without nostalgia,\nBut in office, how can he bear to forget his feelings?\nIn leisure, speech must be precise,\nPlanning ahead ensures peace.\nYet the road ahead cannot be without nostalgia,\nAnd in office, how can he bear to forget his feelings?",
      "overlap_context": "on Ascending the Tower After Snow Clears**\n\nA hundred-foot tower stands in the wake of light snow,\nAt dusk, the idle gaze grows piercingly clear.\nMountains stretch through evening mist, rising then falling,\nWater parts the sparse woods, faint yet bright.\nAt the sky’s edge, sunset glows in a thousand strands,\nThe wind carries the last notes of a distant horn.\nThis moment, this scene—truly fit for a painting,\nYet I fear the painter’s brush lacks such precision.\n\n---\n\n**New Year’s Eve on the Road**",

Earth\"*\n*Yi Chuan Shao Yong Yaofu*\n\n**Congratulating a Retiring Official**\n\nCommon sentiment mostly delights in holding office,\nYet how could a man of understanding ever be bound?\nSurrendering the seal was never for scant salary,\nNor was hanging up the cap for advanced age.\nThrough things’ nature, he grasped the principles of rise and fall,\nAnd so awakened to Heaven’s power in acceptance and rejection.\nFitting to release his cares amid pure scenes—\nIn his homeland, fine forests and springs await.\n\n**Early Autumn**\n\nSummer departs, yet heat lingers still,\nAfter rain, coolness at last arrives.\nBefore the bridge, waters have long flowed,\nBeyond the sky, thunder yet startles.\nA curved armrest hides in quietude,\nThe crossbar gate opens in leisure.\nAll bold ambitions are now spent—\nWhy trouble the heart further?\n\n**Written in Passing**\n\nLaughable, yet also pitiable—\nWhat, after all, is human life?\nAll ten thousand affairs\nShould be gathered into a single song.\nWorldly affairs shift faster than a palm’s turn,\nYears pass swifter than rushing waves.\nIn stillness, the true qi’s savor—\nWhat is gained is beyond measure.\n\n**Injured Foot**\n\nMisfortune comes from the unexpected,\nYet the harm was never deep.\nSelf-betraying the principles of nurturing life,\nIt brought parents sorrowful concern.\nSuddenly, walking became difficult,\nBy chance, climbing was hindered.\nA month passed before I could go out—\nHard to forget the admonition of *Lezheng*.\n\n**Leisurely Stroll**\n\nThe garden lies desolate,\nI chant verses circling the marsh’s edge.\nWind startles after the first autumn sacrifice,\nLeaves fall before the frost arrives.\nWithered grass frames the slanting sun,\nEvening clouds prop up the distant sky.\nWhen shall I perceive the true image?\nOnly by entering wordlessness.\n\n**Morning Rising**\n\nMountains high, waters deep—\nNo remedy for the present.\nEarth holds the affairs of a moment,\nHeaven opens the heart of eternity.\nLight mist veils the morning pavilion,\nFine rain scatters through green woods.\nThough this scene is plain,\nWhere in the world can it be found?\n\n**Moonlit Night**\n\nRain clears, the wind is fine,\nAutumn’s touch, the sky not yet cold.\nI move my bed beneath the steps,\nWatching the moon rise from the forest’s edge.\nWine is here to share,\nBut no guests to join the joy.\nWhen later I meet a true friend,\nThis scene will be hard to seek again.\n\n**Basin Pond**\n\nThree or five small lotuses,\nA basin holds little water.\nThough not a vast marsh,\nStill, tiny waves arise.\nRoughly evoking rivers and lakes,\nYet no mandarin ducks or egrets pass.\nThe recluse’s delight is hard to suppress—\nOften pacing, drunk and chanting.\n\n**Two Poems on Roaming the Mountains**\n\nThe Luo River has many fine peaks,\nThe Yi River many fine bamboos.\nEach has its season for wandering,\nThough frequent, the eye never tires.\nSeeking purity is no breach of integrity,\nExploring the secluded is no disgrace.\nDeer do no harm to men—\nThe heart harms no deer.\n\nThe Two Peaks have many fine summits,\nThe Three Rivers many fine clouds.\nGazing without weariness,\nHarmonious qi subtly nurtures the spirit.\nIf a single thought stirs restlessly,\nTen thousand affairs follow in turmoil.\nPeople say the value of idleness is great—\nBecome a man of idleness.\n\n**Composed on the Road to Longmen**\n\nThe principles of things and human nature are clear,\nWhy fret over one’s life?\nExpansion and contraction lie in my calculations,\nUse and rejection follow the times, without fixed names.\nAll around, clouds and mountains are joy,\nNot a speck of glory or disgrace need startle.\nThe gates of nobles are said to be deep as the sea—\nFor thirty years, I’ve strolled past with arms swinging.\n\n**On Fame and Gain**\n\nFame and gain, in the end, are no joy,\nWind and waves ultimately offer little peace.\nSlightly near to good repute—take little,\nOnly when close to pure delight—seek more.\nGood repute, though abundant, must bring trouble,\nPure delight, though ample, brings no sorrow.\nDoes the world know this truth?\nYet in endless succession, they follow the overturned tracks.\n\n**Thirty Years’ Chant**\n\nThirty years span a generation,\nWithin them, much to laugh and sigh over.\nHeaven’s giving and taking never cease,\nHuman right and wrong never end.\nFortunate mandarin ducks—heads turn white early,\nThe cuckoo’s cry—blood flows first.\nKnow this: talent is the harm,\nYet when talent is gone, one still frets.\n\n**Responding to a Man’s Unrestrained Words**\n\nLong unseen—how have you fared?\nNew poems emerge with laughter and words anew.\nThrough things’ principles, awakening deepens temperament’s calm,\nAfter grasping Heaven’s heart, emotions grow distant.\nYou’ve fully attained Meng’s joy—boundless,\nYet to know Qu’s non-self—still in excess.\nMostly, empty fame is as you say—\nThis body willingly ages among woodcutters and fishermen.\n\n**First Outing to the Luo River, Leaving Through Houzai Gate**\n\nFirst stepping beyond the capital’s gate,\nWest and south, toward the Luo’s corner.\nMountains and rivers open distant thoughts,\nHeaven and earth hang in both eyes.\nVillages at dusk amid mulberries and elms,\nFarmers’ fields of millet and sorghum in autumn.\nThe people have such joy—\nWhy wait for enfeoffment?\n\n**Staying at Yanqiu Village**\n\nDriving the carriage into the Luo River valley,\nDismounting to play by the flying spring.\nSuddenly, the joy of clouds and mountains,\nUtterly free of court and market clamor.\nNot only does it delight the heart and will,\nIt naturally forgets the body’s words.\nAsking friends in the dust—\nWho has grasped it first?\n\n**Staying at the West Temple of Shou’an**\n\nFine scenes truly move the heart,\nDirectly refreshing flesh and bone.\nFor the many fine vistas,\nEspecially glad to be near the capital.\nBamboo hues blend with mountain hues,\nPine sounds mingle with water sounds.\nHow could I refuse to love it all day?\nI set my mat beside the empty pillars.\n\n**Two Poems Crossing Yongji Bridge**\n\nBehind the mountains, a brocade screen unfolds,\nThe river bends by Yongji’s turn.\nFields level as a palm,\nMulberries and oaks large as locust trees.\nThe slanting sun shoots through the rainbow’s departure,\nLow clouds bring approaching rain.\nEndlessly, I waste this pure scene—\nAlways ashamed of my lack of talent.\n\nA stream, a creek—each a gate,\nCreek gates where clouds gather again.\nRare birds warble in tall trees,\nSecluded deer dart through wild brambles.\nRain trails across the flat land,\nRice paddies prop up distant villages.\nThe high city is half ruined—\nMatters of rise and fall—best not discussed.\n\n**Composed Upon Reaching Fuchang County**\n\nHow many love pure scenes?\nThose who do must seek them far.\nOnly when near Han Peak,\nDoes one see the Luo River’s depth.\nThe county lies in the clouds and mountains’ embrace,\nThe people dwell in the heart of waters and bamboos.\nFree of schemes, like idle things,\nI feel even fewer know me.\n\n**At Yan Hall**\n\nUpon the river, several peaks green,\nAmid the woods, a stream bright.\nWandering clouds have no fixed form,\nSecluded birds bear no names.\nCompanions were not prearranged,\nReturn dates cannot be set.\nThe trifles of the human world—\nCease striving to be fierce.\n\n**Viewing the Southern Mountains from the Upper Temple**\n\nPeak upon peak,\nWestward, they stretch to Liang and Yong’s expanse.",

remain, towering and rugged.\n\n**At the County Magistrate’s Lotus Pond Study**\n\nBefore the magistrate’s small study,\nThe water is clear, the pond bears lotuses.\nNot only to gaze at the blossoms,\nBut also to listen to the murmuring stream.\nJust like by rivers and lakes,\nFar from the dust and earth.\nWhere the ancients applied their minds,\nSurely not in vain.\n\n**The Shrine of Lady Ji**\n\nTo the southwest stands a lofty mountain,\nShrouded in the dim and distant.\nImmortals cannot be seen,\nOnly endless clouds and mist.\nThe thousand-year-old shrine of Lady Ji,\nIts gate by the banks of the Luo River.\nOnly the strains of *Nishang* remain,\nStill passed down among the people.\n\n**The Ruins of Lianchang Palace**\n\nThe Luo River comes from the southwest,\nThe Chang River from the northwest.\nWhere the two waters merge,\nPalace walls bear remnant bricks.\nTravelers vainly imagine,\nAll past affairs now mere traces.\nOnly Lady Ji’s mountain remains,\nFacing the Three Villages Post.\n\n**On the River, Recalling the Past**\n\nLast autumn I roamed the source of the Luo,\nThis autumn I roam the Luo’s course.\nThough the river’s waters are unfeeling,\nThe human heart grows still.\nEyes dazzled by a thousand mountains,\nEach peak wreathed in mist.\nWhen the mountains end, the mist does not,\nMerging with the boundless sky.\nFarmers busy tending crops,\nWaterfowl idly seeking fish.\nOne toils for food, the other rests—\nHow different their ways.\nYet when events pass, joy and sorrow are seen,\nWhen times change, expansion and contraction are known.\nLooking back at these two,\nSwitched in place—what then?\nToday’s mountains were once plains,\nToday’s plains were once rivers.\nIf even mountains and rivers change so,\nHow much more should human affairs be trusted?\nFortunate to escape the red dust,\nI ride the wind and waves, lashing the whip.\nThe land stretches far, rivers and plains vast,\nA lone village by misty waters at ease.\nLightning flickers as dragons cross the shore,\nClouds scatter as rain shifts the mountains.\nFarmers shoulder their hoes and leave,\nFishermen return with nets on their backs.\nOnly I am drenched,\nStill on the road.\n\n**Summer Drinking at Yan Hall**\n\nYan Hall opens to the heights,\nIts eaves clinging to jagged cliffs.\nCool winds come through pine boughs,\nClear springs cascade through bamboo shade.\nFine fruits mingle red and green,\nChoice wine flows shallow and deep.\nYet I recall the bustling markets,\nWhere stifling heat cannot be borne.\n\n**Leisure at Yan Hall**\n\nThe net of heaven is wide, hard to escape,\nThe net of the world is dense, impossible to pass.\nMy heart long unmoved,\nFreed from both nets.\nTall bamboos rinse in clear springs,\nTowering pines welcome the pure wind.\nOr again: the moon between pines, so free,\nThe wind beyond bamboos, so cool.\nAt this moment, meeting this scene,\nIt perfectly matches this heart.\n\n**Composed on the River on the Day of Beginning of Autumn**\n\nWealth and honor are hard to love,\nPoverty and cold easily bring sorrow.\nDo not carry youthful airs\nInto old age as shame.\nSince there is extraordinary joy,\nBeware of unexpected grief.\nWho can guarantee the end from the beginning,\nTo remain forever a duke or marquis?\n\n**Discourse on Bear Ear Mountain**\n\nLong ago, Yu divided the Nine Provinces,\nGuiding the Luo from Bear Ear.\nBear Ear has two peaks—\nWhich one is correct?\nThe eastern one lies near Chengzhou,\nThe western one is cut off by the Dan River.\nThe records speak of Shangluo—\nThis saying is right.\n\n**Climbing Lady Ji’s Mountain**\n\nI have seen many mountains,\nBut never encountered such marvels.\nVast cliffs like crouching tigers,\nPerilous rocks like unfurled banners.\nClouds idle, now spreading, now rolling,\nRock forms shifting again and again.\nEven with brush and ink, hard to depict—\nOn all sides, it is just so.\n\n**Gazing South at Yi River from the River**\n\nThe mountain retains Yu’s chiseled gate,\nThe river holds Yao’s water marks.\nThe ancients are no longer seen,\nYet their traces may still remain.\nYears and months easily wither,\nGood and evil are hard to bury.\nDo not pursue fame in recent times,\nStriving for worldly esteem.\n\n**The Cowherd Boy**\n\nFollowing with hat and raincoat,\nNever disturbing heaven’s harmony.\nWarmth plays by the ruined city,\nCold nestles by ancient tombs.\nA few notes from the ox-back flute,\nA tune from the ridge’s song.\nHe seems without care,\nAsking nothing of court affairs.\n\n**Chanting in a Dream on the Road to Three Villages**\n\nSpeaking of dreams within a dream, still remembered,\nAwake from the dream, the dream is yet distant.\nToday’s favor and glory are empty joy,\nYesterday’s love and affection are hard to find.\nWhere water flows, how can there be no sound?\nWhen flowers fade, how can there be color?\nPassing this, meeting strangers on the road,\nAll as if never known before.\n\n**Thirty-Six Autumn Thoughts**\n\n**I**\nThe autumn night begins long,\nStars and constellations vie in brilliance.\nThe courtyard, washed by light rain,\nPillow and mat grow slightly cool.\nShining on things, no form escapes,\nThe empty mirror has its own light.\nShining on affairs, no feeling escapes,\nThe empty heart has its own constancy.\n\n**II**\nAt the bright window, the sun’s glow fades,\nThe secluded courtyard, freshly washed by rain.\nRed orchids quietly unfold,\nGreen bamboos idly lean together.\nHonor and profit like floating clouds,\nFeelings as light as water.\nNot a man from beyond the heavens,\nYet thoughts arise from beyond the heavens.\n\n**III**\nThe bright moon rises from the sea’s heart,\nCool winds stir at the sky’s edge.\nThings reveal themselves,\nThe heart suddenly opens wide.\nUnderstanding all the power of Zhou and Confucius,\nUntying the knots of benevolence and righteousness.\nRites and laws were meant to guard against treachery,\nNot set for us.\n\n**IV**\nSparse rain drips on the tall parasol tree,\nGentle winds brush the tender willows.\nThis scene repeats year after year,\nYet people still grow old.\nWorldly cares easily entangle,\nDusty hearts hard to shake off.\nFloating life is already in a dream,\nForcing existence within it.\n\n**V**\nClear rapids pattern mandarin ducks,\nCold pools embroider cormorants.\nThe vast sky, pure as water,\nDoes not hinder the autumn river’s green.\nA man’s inch-long heart,\nA warrior’s match for ten thousand foes.\nAmid lotus-scented winds,\nA lone boat—we will meet again.\n\n**VI**\nYesterday I longed for cool broth,\nToday I long to put away the fan.\nNot only do people wield spears,\nHeat and cold wage their own battles.\nProfit and harm arise from feeling,\nLikes and dislikes depend on perception.\nTo wish others to be good,\nOne must first be good oneself.\n\n**VII**\nSweet persimmons, green as indigo,\nRed peaches, fresh as blood.\nI cannot bear to pluck them with my hands,\nMuch less bite them with my teeth.\nTheir color is already lovely,\nTheir taste even more exquisite.\nEating them, no fine words,\nAlas for mouth and tongue.\n\n**VIII**\nThe nation’s fate lies with the people,\nThe people’s fate lies with food.\nEven if the sages were reborn,\nThis saying would not change.",

discuss them?\nI only fear the wine jar will run dry.\nGreen plantain leaves unfurl,\nBlue reeds bow low.\nWind and rain howl through the sky,\nThe night deepens with the water-clock’s drip.\n\nThose

light wind sways the cold rain.\nAt dusk, people have all returned,\nOnly the flock of chickens still pecks at the millet.\n\nThis heart remains unmoved,\nYet this matter is most difficult to handle.\nTo sum it up in a single word—\nI fear even that would waste breath.\n\nIn the eighth month, heat and chill balance,\nThe qi and flavor are naturally fine.\nFacing the void, tall trees bow low,\nFrom afar, the traveler appears small.\nAll traces of affairs are illusions,\nWith a heart devoid of intent, things are all resolved.\nWhy ask further about bitterness?\nI wish only that you taste the smartweed yourself.\n\nYellow millet ripens in autumn,\nYellow chickens grow plump in autumn.\nThese things are easily obtained,\nThe ancients held them in high regard.\nThey can welcome

and call it wine—\nDrink it, and one may become drunk.\nThe rigid it makes supple,\nThe timid it makes resolute.\nIt skillfully wields the power of creation—\nIts merit is no small thing.\n\nAutumn’s hues deepen day by day,\nThe old heart grows ever more indolent.\nWeary, I descend the steps to walk,\nAt leisure, I toy with books and scrolls.\nWide roads teem with wind and dust,\nI hear it is hard

already departed.\nClouds and mountains stretch in a thousand layers—\nWhere shall we meet again?\n\nThe city gates of Jiye rise high,\nThe long pavilion roads wind far.\nThe land’s ways ruin men’s clothes—\nNewly made, they soon turn old.\nBeyond the intermittent cries of cicadas,\nSparse hawks descend ahead.\nThe years pass in vain,\nHuman affairs grow ever more desolate.\n\nWashing the bamboo to preserve new shoots,\nTurning the pages to find old writings.\nWho knows the one who nurtures the heart\nWould ever vie with the world for power?\n\nThe Mid-Autumn’s scenery is fine,\nThe Central

single matter in the heart—\nThe world knows nothing of it.\n\nA fine moon fills the high tower,\nThe high tower still in Mid-Autumn.\nAt midnight, cold dew descends,\nA thousand miles of cold light flows.\nWho will take up this mirror,\nWipe it clean, newly polished, and rest?\nIlluminating one breaks the heart of ten thousand ages,\nWhitening ten thousand ages’ heads.\n\nCold dew clings to withered grass,\nA bleak wind shakes the evening woods.\nBird cries rise and fall,\nThe sky’s mood shifts from clear to overcast.\nThe season changes in an instant,\nThe heart holds a thousand ages’ longing.\nWho says Ziji is dead?\nThe whole world lacks a knowing friend.\n\nWind-tossed willows scatter like a comb,\nFrost-laden clouds thin as a broom’s sweep.\nA high tower pierces the perilous void,\nLow mist sways in the early cold.\nAt this moment, my mood is boundless—\nHow can I battle autumn’s aging?\nI can only take up the wine bottle\nAnd pour it out to the west wind.\n\nPond lotuses daily wither,\nHedge chrysanthemums daily flourish.\nAmong the ranks of things,\nThey contend with the seasons’ rhythm.\nFlourishing and decay do not coincide,\nThe worthy and foolish cannot walk side by side.\nHow can one obtain the heart of pine and cassia,\nEvergreen through all four seasons?\n\nMen grow old as autumn grows older,\nMountains deepen, waters deepen.\nTall trees have already shed their leaves,\nWise birds sing in vain.\nSinews and bones are not as they once were,\nVirtue betrays its original intent.\nFortunately, my remaining writings endure—\nFrom time to time, they may still be sought.\n\nIn the ninth month, the qi suddenly turns stern,\nWithered willows still harbor cicadas.\nBeyond the frost, sparse bells fall silent,\nThe wind’s remnants carry clear sounds.\nA thousand mountains confuse the distant gaze,\nA lone osprey soars into the high heavens.\nIf one is not a transcendent being,\nHow dare one speak of perilous deeds?\n\nPears redden under heavy

heaven’s harmony?\nFrom time to time, drink a cup of wine.\n\nRed leaves battle the west wind,\nYellow blossoms laugh at the cold sun.\nThe Dao of heaven has its waxing and waning,\nHuman affairs have no fixed certainty.\nStillness prevails, leaving a lingering savor,\nDreams depart, revealing what was lost.\nProfit and harm do not follow one another,\nRight and wrong only then emerge.\n\nOn the

ancestor left a noble legacy—\nI entrust you to seek what remains.\nYou sent me a poem,\nTitled *Stone Pillar Village*.\nWhen the stone pillar was first erected,\nIts origins were lost in antiquity.\nThe *Fen Shaan Inscription* was carved there,\nYet only Tang scholars spoke of it.\nYears have passed in great number,\nIts beginning and end now lack complete text.\nHard to verify or correct,\nHow then to trace its source?\nI lament my scant reading,\nMy knowledge no greater than others’.\nBeyond classics and histories,\nI cannot dispel the world’s confusion.\nIf following Changqing’s *Gongyang*,\nIt should begin at Shaan.\nIf following your *Chen Biming*,\nIt should speak of Zhou’s completion.\nTaking both together,\nThe meaning may yet be honored.\nDividing governance between east and west suburbs,\nOne may discuss it in terms of Shaan and Luo.\nIf this explanation nears the mark,\nPerhaps it may ease the tangle.\n\nThe sweet pear’s shade still flourishes,\nThe stone pillar remains fresh and green.\nThe grand affairs of that time,\nI could not witness firsthand.\nThe pure teachings of *Er Nan*,\nThe noble fragrance of those two lords—\nA tale of beauty for a thousand years,\nI may yet hear of it.\n\nTo abandon the classics and rely on commentaries,\nConfucian scholars fundamentally reject.\nI write this poem to clarify,\nHastening this humble reply to you.\n\n**Free Expression**\nHaving attained the joy of stillness and emptiness,\nI am no longer startled by favor or disgrace.\nMud and void—still attachments;\nEqualizing things—ultimately a

ever hard to come by,\nAuspicious times are not easily met.\nLacking talent to aid the realm,\nI am content to enjoy a year of abundance.\nWater and bamboo cradle the heart,\nOrioles and flowers dwell in deep pools.\nLike Lao Lai, my joy knows no end,\nThe delight of quiet integrity is boundless.\nCarefree, I keep company with true friends,\nPlanning to congratulate Your Excellency.\nMy red sincerity is but self-expression—\nNot repayment for your profound kindness.\n\n**New Spring Chant**\nAt fifty-two, my bones and sinews ail,\nYet this new spring I still share cups with

sway for others’ joys or sorrows—\nFor twenty years, it has been as ash.\n\n**A Guest’s Chant**\nBetween Yi and Song, a guest would speak no words,\nAdvancing or retreating—all awaits heaven’s will.\nLoving quiet, I cannot forget streams and stones,\nFinding joy in leisure—not to learn immortality.\nNo need to sigh over purple streets, hard for guests,\nJust delight in the clean wind, which costs no coin.\nWhy quibble over bending a foot to gain a yard?\nThis heart is vast—it seeks no perfection.\n\n**Encountering Spring in the Small Garden**\nContent with pavilions and railings, I too play at beauty,\nNo harm in lingering by the wine stove.\nNight eaves quietly admit the moon through flowers,\nDaytime doors chill with mist beyond the bamboo.\nThings, once understood, are all by chance—\nHeaven’s decree to be idle is not in vain.\nHow much time fills the gourd’s sun and moon?\nTwelve years of splendid scenery, wantonly seized.\n\n**Late Spring Chant**\nSpring arrives, the small garden teems with blossoms—\nWho dwells in poverty, who in wealth and honor?\nBeyond the gate, willow shade floats in emerald luster,\nBefore the steps, flower shadows glide in crimson light.\nNew swallows under the beams have yet to tune their tongues,\nReturning geese at the sky’s edge have already taken flight.\nI ask my heart’s source—what does it hold?\nIt answers: a fondness for carefree indolence.\n\n**Cherishing the Fragrant and Luxuriant**\nWeighing the world’s thousand affairs,\nAll lose to flowers’ shared delight.\nMost of spring’s splendor lasts but a season,\nIts full glory barely ten days.\nI fear sorrow may bring discord,\nAnd guard against wind and rain’s hardships.\nLet not regret follow after—\nBefore the fire fades, one may still climb.\n\n**Reply to a Gift**\nMy temples need not fret over turning frost,\nFor I have the solace of zither and books, and you.\nLacking great talent to serve a flourishing age,\nI can but rest my head on the southern window.\nI know my strength cannot be forced,\nYet still speak of mountains and clouds not yet surrendered.\nDeep thanks to my old friend for such love—\nLike a stranded fish, I am spared from the western river’s plight.\n\n**Playing with the Brush**\nAt fifty-two, what more have I to fear in old age?\nAffairs are valued when seen to the bottom,\nWords are hard to speak to the end.\nAbove,

clumsy,\nBut one word of confusion may yet dissolve.\nThe world holds no great matters,\nYet the land abounds with heroic talent.\nI fear only that men are hard to find,\nNot that the Dao remains unrevealed.\nWhen envy’s heart is wholly cast aside,\nWhat dust remains to trouble me?\n\n**Thanks for the Gift of a Brush**\nI cherish this gift of the study,\nGratefully received from afar.\nThe rabbit’s hair is firm and strong,\nThe bamboo shaft straight and long.\nIn stillness, I transcribe new poems,\nIn leisure, I copy old remedies.\nBeyond such uses, it is enough\nTo nurture the blade’s keen edge.\n\n**Composed on Affairs**\nHeaven and earth hold eternal principles,\nSun and moon never hide their forms.\nBeyond a full belly and sound sleep,\nAll else is but empty fame.\nThough lacking the talents of Yi or Lü,\nI remain a subject of Yao and Shun.\nWhy must one become a minister\nTo bring about great peace?\n\n**Twin-Lotus Blossoms**\nThe Han court’s graceful sisters,\nThe divine maidens of Tiantai’s peaks—\nAll once knew the passions of their time,\nYet were banished to earth as auspicious lotuses.\n\n**Reply to a Letter**\nConfucius spoke of rectifying one’s nature,\nZiyou of embodying one’s form.\nWho attains these two\nLives not in vain.\nIf friendships are forged through the Dao,\nAnd feelings stirred by sincerity,\nThen though three armies stand before you,\nNone can overpower you.\n\n**In Response to a Letter**\nWithout rank, establishing deeds is hard;\nMeeting the times, achieving merit is easy.\nSeeking perfection invites ruin,\nPursuing greatness requires overlooking details.\nTo reject evil risks wounding kindness,\nTo tolerate evil risks harming righteousness.\nThough the heart of a benevolent man beats,\nHis intent remains far from true benevolence.\n\n**Reply to a Letter**\nA minister’s yearly stipend\nWould fund a poor scholar’s lifetime.\nWorldly titles differ,\nBut the heavenly title is never lacking.\nWithout frost and snow,\nHow would we know the pine and cassia?\nThough no office elevates me,\nHow can the Dao not ennoble me?\n\n**Reminiscing with an Old Friend**\nWhat ears and eyes have witnessed,\nI recount from thirty springs.\nTen intercalary months have passed,\nAnd people have changed once more.\nThe old families cling to their ways,\nWhile the vermilion gates host new carriages.\nAll has always been by chance—\nWhat can be called true merit?\n\n**Idle Verses**\nCasually I take up my brush,\nEver delighting in the spirit’s play.\nNever without a scene to match,\nYet never bound by emotion.\nLines come drifting into being,\nPoems form by chance.\nThe workings of heaven are hard to describe—\nYet one point stands clear.\n\n**Idle Sitting**\nI once planned for the years ahead,\nYet today’s affairs elude my grasp.\nHeaven’s mandate does not favor me,\nSo I find solace in mountains and clouds.\nThrough no merit of my own, I grow detached,\nAnd so approach the realm of the profound.\nI would mock the true master,\nWho toils without knowing why.\n\n**Strolling at Tianjin**\nThe Son of Heaven’s ancient domain,\nWhere lush vitality still lingers.\nGardens and woods lie near the water,\nPalaces and towers stretch into autumn’s distance.\nThe waves recall summer’s heat,\nThe bridge’s rainbow fades not in the clear sky.\nOn days when the world knows no strife,\nThis place invites lingering.\n\n**Secluded at Tianjin**\nMy home lies within Luoyang’s walls,\nAnd here, too, at Tianjin’s edge.\nThe sun rises early here,\nSpring comes easily to the low sky.\nTime favors the state’s flourishing,\nScenery enriches the recluse.\nI may now cast aside cap and sash,\nAnd grow old in leisure here.\n\n**The Sound of Tianjin’s Waters**\nThe Luo River flows near my hut,\nIts murmurs reaching my pillow’s emptiness.\nThe rapids startle in late autumn,\nThe waves quicken at the fifth watch’s dawn.\nGentle winds trace their delicate paths,\nFierce rains swell their mighty currents.\nFor the recluse, this is joy enough—\nWhy wait for pipes and zithers?\n\n**Sleepless**\nThe night deepens as I sit idly,\nYet sleep eludes me in the long hours.\nTossing, I cannot rest,\nAnd so reflect on past affairs.\nPillow laid, my mind grows dull,\nBlanket drawn, my thoughts remain bright.\nIn the moonlit western window,\nA few leaves of the plantain sway.\n\n**The Small Pavilion of Heavenly Palace**\nIn summer, I reach the Heavenly Palace,\nLeaning on the railing, my gaze knows no bounds.\nThe ancients held lofty aspirations,\nThe Son of Heaven built a mighty capital.\nPavilions lie deep within clouds,\nMountains and rivers fade into evening mist.\nTravelers come and go in vain—\nWho shares this sentiment?\n\n**Listening to the Qin**\nThe qin is best heard at night,\nAwakening a different feeling.\nJust as the mournful gibbons fall silent,\nThe parting phoenix begins its cry.\nThe green mountains stretch endlessly,\nWhite hair need not cause alarm.\nOnly when one grasps the mind of sitting-in-forgetfulness\nDoes one know the heart of the distant past.\n\n**Twenty-Six Reflections on Tianjin**\n\nLight clouds, pale sun—dusk at Tianjin,\nFierce winds, sparse woods—autumn on the Luo.\nWalking alone, chanting alone, none understand,\nAs gulls and egrets alight on the islets.\n\nFavor and disgrace—matters now unseen,\nRise and fall—times gone, only sorrow remains.\nLook upon Chang’an’s roads today—\nEven at dusk, people still come and go.\n\nThe phoenix tower’s depths lock away clouds and mist,\nA hundred years pass with each sealing.\nGrieving for the sacrifices at Fenyin’s western altar,\nThe imperial banners betray the heavens of Shangyang.\n\nWho drew the long river through Luoyang’s walls?\nThe imperial carriage’s eastward journey made light of this place.\nThe mighty waves chafe at Tianjin’s restraints,\nDay and night roaring in furious tumult.\n\nThe sun sets in the west, waters flow east,\nTime shifts through the passing years.\nDistant mountains gather their dark hues on all sides—\nWho do they grieve for all day long?\n\nBusy men bear burdens—what difference between the two?\nComing and going always follow this path.\nHow much better to sit idly, untalented,\nWith clouds and waters swirling about my robes.\n\nThey say fishing discerns the floating and sinking,\nBut such discernment demands deep intent.\nI am ashamed not to know the harm in desire,\nYet lightly stir my heart in hope of catching fish.\n\nSince ancient times, abandoned capitals hold many empty spaces,\nTowering trees teem with cawing crows at dusk.\nWhere crumbling walls and broken ramparts are tilled by men,\nHalf were once the homes of ministers and nobles.\n\nThe phoenix towers stand cold in autumn’s chill,\nBeneath the bridge, long waves flow toward the sea.\nFor a thousand years, this was the old imperial market—\nHow many times have people passed through here?\n\nHooves and wheels clash without cease,\nDeparting as if in pursuit, arriving as if in contest.\nI reckon their hearts hold no other concern—\nIf not for profit, then for fame.\n\nTrees fade into autumn’s embrace,\nHomes nestle amid the sound of waters.\nA few rows of crows fly off at an angle,\nA cluster of towers clings precariously to the void.\n\nThe clear waters stretch to the azure sky,\nThe level plains merge with distant mountains.\nAn old man with white hair, his heart at ease,\nLeans idly on the railing, gazing at the Luo River.",

      "translated_text": "Last year’s man who leaned on the bridge’s railing,\nThis year rides past its edge on horseback.\nBridge above and bridge below—countless crossings,\nYet now I recall only thirteen springs.\n\nBy the embankment, grasses grow lush and green,\nOn the paths, travelers come and go.\nThe clear waters strive for purity but never attain it,\nThe spring winds refuse to let the willow branches rest.\n\nThough currents rush, the scene remains serene,\nThough blossoms fall in profusion, the mind stays at ease.\nUnlike men of the world who age in busyness,\nNever once in their lives knowing an open smile.\n\nBy the stream, I sit idly, my eyes half-lidded,\nWaves strike the long embankment as if to break it.\nHow many waterfowl, their plumage bright with color,\nAgain and again take flight, then return.\n\nFame and profit have always followed talent,\nNo need for travelers to guess at one another’s schemes.\nHow much time lies within the gourd’s embrace?\nI stroll the Heavenly Ford, watching the ebb and flow.\n\nThe land tilts southeastward as a whole,\nWhen will its waters ever find peace?\nThe Heavenly Ford lies where the currents race fastest—\nEndless depths, all roaring with the same sound.\n\nThree thousand *li* away, the frontier is called wild,\nFor a hundred years, the realm has been at peace.\nYet how can it compare to the carefree man of the Luo River,\nWho needs no fief to know true honor?\n\nWillows sway around the embankment in the soft wind,\nPavilions across the water stand veiled in fine rain.\nAfter the Double Ninth, wine leaves one half-tipsy—\nAt this moment, the flavor is beyond compare.\n\nObserving the world’s affairs from a place of stillness,\nRefining one’s feelings in leisure’s embrace:\nWhen all storms subside and only still waters remain,\nWhat in this world cannot be made level?\n\nSince Sui and Tang, nobles and ministers have been exalted,\nIn recent times, men chase fame and profit through turmoil.\nI ask the waters beneath the Heavenly Ford Bridge:\nWhat sound did their rushing make in those days?\n\nCountless nobles and ministers of former dynasties—\nLater ages remember only their names.\nYet these waters beneath the Heavenly Ford Bridge\nHave flowed with the same sound from ancient times to now.\n\nNot a wisp of cloud dares touch the bright moon,\nThe bridge spans a thousand *xun*, lying across the green waves.\nI reckon no such scene exists in the human world—\nHow could one’s mood not soar when gazing at the moon on Mid-Autumn?\n\nIn the city of Jiaoru, with friends of shared virtue,\nBeneath the Phoenix Towers, we gather for the Mid-Autumn festival.\nThe fragrant wine is drained, and the guests depart,\nYet the moonlight and ripples still vie in brilliance.\n\nOnly when life is understood can one speak of constancy,\nOnly when nature is known can one discuss great plans.\nThis long river flows day and night without cease—\nFor whom is it driven so relentlessly eastward?\n\n**Cheng Ming Yin**\nConfucius was born with knowledge, not through study,\nMencius had prior insight, yet still needed cultivation.\nSincerity and clarity are our family’s own affairs—\nWhy do men of today seek them elsewhere?\n\n**Sheng Shui Yin**\nWater excels at leveling but not at straightening,\nThe plumb line excels at straightening but not at leveling.\nIf water and plumb line could be made one,\nWhat in the world would remain unclear?\n\n**Xin Suan Yin**\nPungent and sour are not the central flavors,\nHow can *shang* and *zheng* be the proper tones?\nThe world cannot distinguish right from wrong—\nWho then can serve as master to calm the heart?\n\n**Ji Mo Yin**\nWhen silence is called for, speech is but dust,\nWhen speech is called for, silence is but grime.\nIf one neither speaks nor stays silent as the moment demands,\nHow can dust and grime ever touch the self?\n\n**Idle Musings on Life**\nNot a trace of heavenly truth is lost,\nYet a thousand measures of human emolument are hard to come by.\nIn this age of peace, I have no other joy—\nOnly wine, three or five cups from time to time.\n\nBamboo rain chills the air as it soaks one through,\nBy the southern window, I wake from sleep and gaze toward Xiaoxiang.\nThe thatched eaves drip without cease—\nI recall the nights spent aboard boats long ago.\n\nAt first light, the moon emerges from the pines,\nIn the height of summer, the wind comes from the water’s surface.\nI have more than most men already—\nHow much more when I can raise my cup again and again?\n\nMy mother in the hall is over eighty,\nBefore the steps, my children laugh and call to one another.\nFine foods are taken as they come, in plenty or in want—\nIs there any joy in the world to match this?\n\nFor three days in a row, I rarely lack pure delight,\nThough deep drinking never exceeds five parts.\nWhen we meet, our hearts hold no other matter—\nWe do not debate rise and fall, only discuss literature.\n\nFlowers and trees mark the seasons with their scenes,\nA thousand volumes of classics are called my livelihood.\nIf anyone asks where I dwell in idleness,\nIt is the first house in the Morality Ward.\n\n**Cooling in the Small Pavilion of Heavenly Palace**\nFrom the small pavilion, I gaze out over Luoyang,\nThe river and sky’s expanse cradles the divine capital.\nWinds come from the peak of Ten-Thousand-Year Mountain—\nHow many mists and clouds share this clarity?\n\nThe small pavilion has done me great service,\nIts coolness unmatched in all of Luoyang.\nAshamed of my own insignificance and good fortune,\nMy sleeves and lapels forever hold the winds of a thousand *li*.\n\nHow rare it is to bear the pavilion’s cool breeze—\nIts mood is that of the ancient sages.\nIn Luoyang lives a nameless guest\nWho for twenty years has enjoyed this coolness.\n\n**Idle Musings in a Stifling Summer Retreat**\nMen find the Heavenly Ford distant,\nThey must come with purpose.\nIn leisure, I know the Way is at peace,\nIn stillness, I feel my spirit open.\n\nI grasp the *Yi* while watching a game of chess,\nDiscuss poetry while toying with a wine cup.\nThe world’s affairs take a thousand forms—\nNone of them trouble my heart.\n\n**Visiting Longmen**\nThe river and sky show little difference,\nA solitary bird descends to the sunlit sands.\nThe road ahead cuts through the mountain’s shape,\nThe river bends where the ferry crossing slants.\n\nCaves and cliffs stand empty by the thousands,\nTwo or three households make up the inns.\nThe clear scenery is fine in all four seasons—\nHow much more so when the capital is not far off?\n\n**Returning to the Luo River**\nTo buy stone is to have clouds in abundance,\nTo buy a mountain is to follow the water.\nClouds can bring about a mind without intent,\nWater can serve as a mirror to still the self.\n\nNature is made clear by a mind without intent,\nFeelings are stilled by the mirror’s reflection.\nNeither can be lost—\nOne emerges from the other.\n\n**Watching Fish by the River**\nThe air is cold with autumn’s touch,\nThe river long, the fish at play.\nThough they know how to avoid the net,\nThey still fear swallowing the hook by mistake.\n\nThey have given up hope of leaping the dragon gate,\nNo longer worry about striking their heads.\nI think of the joy by the Hao River—\nZhuang Zhou’s carefree spirit alone understands.\n\n*The Fourth Volume of Yi Chuan Ji Rang Concludes*\n*The Fifth Volume of Yi Chuan Ji Rang Begins*",

      "translated_text": "**Three Poems on Immediate Matters in the Rear Garden**\n*Jia You Eighth Year*\n\nIn this age of peace, though old, what care have I?\nI wander my home’s garden at leisure, free.\nA few willows cast their shade, just now entwined,\nA few birds sing softly, their voices soon stilled.\n\nBamboo crowds the old path, rising high and low,\nWater fills the spring channels, flowing left and right.\nIf you ask what joy the master finds here—\nHe answers: no different from a marquis’ life.\n\nNature nurtures my indolence, and I know its way,\nIn Luoyang, I’ve claimed my share of water and cloud.\nI hear no worldly storms, no treacherous waves,\nOnly the long days and months within my winecup.\n\nA game of chess detains a wandering guest,\nA few cups of fine wine face the tall bamboo.\nWhen all worldly matters are seen through—\nEven Yan Hui’s seated oblivion seems no more.\n\n---\n\nIn recent years, my illness is called \"poetic madness,\"\nEach bout of madness must be met with wine.\nMy heart delights in the Dao, careless of restraint,\nMy words flow freely, unburdened by thought.\n\nFriends grow closer with time, our bonds endure,\nLike clouds and water, our leisure runs deep.\nNow I understand Yuanming’s profound intent—\nThis window, in his day, rivaled Fuxi’s age.\n\n---\n\n**Watching Chess and Chanting Long**\n\nThe courtyard is still, spring deep, the door ajar,\nBetween bamboo, I watch guests contend at chess.\nThey gather gods and ghosts within their minds,\nArrange rivers and mountains within their grasp.\n\nThe board forms dragons and snakes in battle array,\nThe game ends, geese and crows scatter in flight.\nLike Xiang Yu burying Qin’s soldiers in slaughter,\nOr Fu Jian’s defeat before Jin’s might.\n\nOn the board, spears and shields clash fiercely,\nBefore their eyes, ice and fire swiftly shift.\nLife and death rest on two households’ fate,\nVictory and defeat hinge on a single move.\n\nNo mercy is given where paths cross,\nFacing others, one must feign refusal.\nTo suffer harm in heart is truly dreadful,\nYet even lips and teeth may yet be healed.\n\nTo wound with subtle schemes is called good strategy,\nTo act with cunning in secret is deemed wise.\nLook now upon Chang’an’s roads—\nWho here has not played such games?\n\n---\n\n**Two Poems Ascending Chongde Pavilion on an Autumn Day**\n\nCountless heroes, their ambitions crushed—\nNo need for sighs upon this height.\nMountains and rivers endure after a thousand wars,\nSwords and crowns lie scattered after a hundred years.\n\nSome take glory and fame as their own duty,\nYet who knows if wealth and rank are man’s design?\nPainting and poetry exhaust the world’s wonders,\nBut what meaning lingers when leaning on the railing?\n\n---\n\nA hundred years have been called an age of peace,\nYet still, in the beginning, there was unrest.\nThe capital retains the air of Han and Tang,\nThe palace halls still lack a hegemon’s form.\n\nBeyond the mist, jagged peaks barely emerge,\nAfter frost, half the red trees fade and fall.\nWine in the cup cannot bring drunkenness—\nThe west wind wakes me again and again.\n\n---\n\n**Returning Late After Drinking on an Autumn Day**\n\nWater and bamboo, gardens in autumn—how fine!\nHow could I bear to pour the fragrant wine so soon?\nThe Double Ninth has passed, chrysanthemums just bloom,\nMy heart is full, yet I’ve not learned to age with time.\n\nStill clouds, drooping willows,\nThe wind carries a light chill, hastening dusk.\nBoundless joy cannot be reined—\nMy horse’s hooves tread slowly through the celestial streets.\n\n---\n\n**Sent to Prefect Zu of Shaan, Gentleman of the Palace Zu Zezhi**\n\nDo you recall our meeting?\nBack then, in the eastern seas.\nA thousand miles apart since we parted,\nTen years have slipped by in an instant.\n\nOur paths differ, our names differ,\nYet our hearts are one, our years the same.\nI hope we may meet again in clarity,\nTo share poetry and wine without end.\n\n---\n\n**Lament for Zhang Yuanbo, Director of the Bureau of Operations**\n\nIn recent years, the old guard has fallen one by one,\nStirring sorrow deep within me.\nOf those who hung their caps in Luoyang and retired—\nOnly you were as pure as a transcendent.\n\nOnce we debated who was elder, who younger,\nNow we vie to see who follows whom.\nI pour wine to you—you must know—\nFor you, I shed tears before the west wind.\n\n---\n\n**Lament for Zhang Shirou, Section Chief**\n\nAll his life, he longed to establish merit and fame,\nWho said talent must contend with fate?\nHis final poem expressed refined intent,\nHis coffin closed, but our friendship remained.\n\nThe affairs of the world in his heart—how to unfold them?\nThe realm’s talents will not be judged again.\nIf his spirit knows, he may find solace—\nHis descendants are more than capable of restoring the family name.\n\n---\n\n**Matching the Rhymes of Pei, Vice Magistrate of Dengfeng, Sent in the Renzi Year**\n\nThe tale of the narrow lane and bamboo bowl is well known,\nYet who am I to feel shame at such simplicity?\nSince wealth and rank must come by fate,\nWhy ask heaven about rise or fall?\n\nSilence and stillness cultivate my wild nature,\nNo path to soar like the sages of the age.\nThose who come and go through golden gates—\nShould they laugh at this old man tending his stony fields?\n\n---\n\n**Why Do You Send Poems to the Three Wealthy Lords of the Three Cities?**\n\nWhy do you urge me to ponder so deeply,\nTo seek transcendence with these few words?\nYour actions should be like a thousand-catty crossbow,\nYour tempering should be like a hundred-fold refined gold.\n\nFishing in water, you wield the power of life and death,\nPlaying chess, you stir the heart of war.\nA cup of fine wine may bring some relief—\nIn the grove, I pour myself a drink from time to time.\n\n---\n\n**Letter Written on Behalf of a Friend**\n\nIn my youth, I aspired to stand above the world,\nReading ancient texts, I laughed at Xie An.\nWho would have thought this body would grow old and useless,\nWith no idle ground to linger?\n\nAt chess, I meet worthy opponents, moves worth making,\nBut the zither lacks a knowing ear—I will not play.\nNot only am I unworthy to withdraw in silence—\nThe ancients long lamented the rarity of opportunity.\n\n---\n\n**Visiting Yao Fuzhou, Vice Director of the Bureau of Evaluations, at Moon Dyke’s Western Garden**\n\nLonging could not be restrained,\nSo I came to visit you on West Street.\nCrossing ditches, winding through vegetable plots,\nTrees bow their heads to make way,\nMy staff changes hands as I climb.\n\nAmong friends, our joy is complete—\nWhat greater happiness could there be?\n\n---\n\n**Matching Rhymes in Thanks to Three Gentlemen of Dengfeng—Liu, Li, and Pei—for Inviting Me to Tour the Mountains**\n\nThe gentlemen invite me to Mount Song,\nEach composing new poems in turn.\nI shake off the dust, not daring to lag behind,\nYet in seeking clouds and water, I fear I’ve fallen behind.\n\nSanyang Palace lies near clusters of dark stones,\nWansui Peak towers, veiled in purple mist.\nSo many scenic spots I’ve yet to visit—\nI long to follow the immortals’ footsteps and climb together.\n\n---\n\n**Ascending the Summit of Mount Song**\n\nThe nine provinces stretch far like a chessboard,\nWansui Peak stands tall, gazing upon peace.\nIf one man can govern the four seas,\nWhy should the Central Plains know strife again?\n\nI long fear the rise of treacherous heroes,\nYet wish to be a simple subject of Yao and Shun.\nFifty-three years have passed in idle obscurity—\nNow, at last, I rejoice to see the spring plowing.\n\n---\n\n**Viewing Shaoshi Temple in Dengfeng County**",

      "translated_text": "**For Zhou Shiyan, Magistrate of Pu’an in Jianzhou, Written on Behalf of Shao Yaofu of Yichuan**\n\nTo serve as an official—why sigh for what use?\nNo ascent to heights but begins in humility.\nThe noble man’s bending and stretching is the Dao itself;\nWe Confucians prize advance and retreat as circumstance allows.\n\nEven now, where is Pengze’s return?\nYet the eastern gate’s departure may still come in time.\nI grieve that the scenes of Yi and Song remain boundless—\nA single name, a fine place, yet I seek further emolument.\n\nFrom Shu to the Three Wu, the distance spans ten thousand li.\nLast year, I gazed north; this year, I drive west again.\nJian’ge scrapes the sky and sun;\nQin’s plains bar the imperial capital.\n\nFacing the wind where we recall each other—\nCould you drink a cup with me?\n\n---\n\n**Another Quatrain**\n\nJust when elders should gather in fellowship,\nThe high autumn arrives, desolate and bare.\nA handful of yellow blossoms, a flagon of wine—\nA year has passed since my old friend went west.\n\n---\n\n**In Response to Secretary Zhao Chongde’s Gift**\n\nPeople say official life endangers cap and crown;\nI cherish my life, far from market and court.\nMy rustic face cannot bear rushing to the Wei gates;\nMy idle self is fit only to visit Yang and Liao.\n\nThough my poems lack discipline, a thousand verses remain;\nThough rich in clouds and mountains, I have but a gourd of wine.\nI dread the carriage’s eastward departure—\nFrom now on, how can I summon the wind and moon?\n\n---\n\n**In Response to Director Wang Buyi’s Gift**\n\nFor twenty years I have dwelt in Luoyang,\nWatching the world’s affairs swirl like dust.\nMy form is no more than grass and trees, wild and untrammeled;\nMy heart resembles an ancient bell or tripod, empty yet resonant.\n\nI have bathed in the benevolent breeze to my very marrow;\nNow I marvel at the poetry’s brilliance, like jade and jewels.\nDo not let Zhuang Zhou say names and realities are flawed—\nIt is simply that I lack talent and delight the crowd of monkeys.\n\n---\n\n**In Response to Professor Wei’s Gift**\n\nIn this pure age, literature hangs like sun and moon;\nThough talentless, I am fortunate to enjoy abundant years.\nI wander Mount Tai’s Greater and Lesser Chambers;\nI gaze upon the Yi River and the Luo.\n\nOf old, Mencius found enlightenment hard to speak of;\nIn this age, without Yanzi, who is deemed worthy?\nEach time I read to the root of heaven,\nI fear the masters will ask of the profoundest mysteries.\n\n---\n\n**In Response to Vice Minister Wu Chongqing’s Gift**\n\nNon-being and being are the ancestral homeland,\nYet all things differ by a hair’s breadth.\nEvery person may reach it, though I have not;\nNo thing obstructs—who could hinder whom?\n\nLost, liver and spleen become Chu and Yue;\nGained, coarse greens become fine millet.\nA single word, through the ages, is hard to fathom—\nIts wondrous workings must be seen at Lüliang.\n\n---\n\n**In Response to Instructor Sun Chuanshi’s Gift**\n\nSouth of Tianjin Bridge stands my humble hut,\nWhere you, my lord, deign to visit by carriage.\nSince retiring, I have forgotten restraint;\nFrom long idleness, my learning has grown hollow.\n\nBetter to inscribe my name in history’s annals—\nOr should I bear plain books and face the clouds and mountains?\nA single piece of sincere devotion is hardest to describe;\nPerhaps I may yet resemble the Red and Void.\n\n---\n\n**In Rhyme for the Longevity Snow Gathering with Academician Chen Chengbo**\n\nThe garden’s flowers renew in a single night;\nJade Terrace’s twelve peaks turn to dust.\nIn the city, bamboo-leaf wine surges in price;\nAt the feast, willow catkins vie to learn spring.\n\nThe Liang Garden gathering draws all the inked guests—\nWho recalls the divine beings of Guye?\nMy surplus grain need not fill a thousand granaries;\nEven a foot’s depth of snow should not be spurned for its frequency.\n\n---\n\n**In Rhyme for the Garden Gathering at the Historiography Bureau, Composed on the Spot**\n\nBamboo reaches high, pines encircle the pavilion—\nWho comes here feels their bones and hair grow pure.\nPlum branches, laden with snow, barely crack open;\nWater veins, linked to ice, murmur in their flow.\n\nThe year’s end in late winter stirs inescapable feeling;\nHalf-drunk, my sleeves cannot contain my emotion.\nWho pities the late Chancellor’s empty name?\nHow can our Dao be put into practice?\n\n---\n\n**On Zhang Xian of Kuixia’s “Remembering the Past at Baidi City”**\n\nNo need to resent Cao’s rise in Xuchang—\nHad it not been for Liang and Yi, none could contend for the throne.\nThe realm divided, wind and thunder raged;\nCutting across the southwest, his might was unmatched.\n\nTravelers come and go, idly pointing;\nHistorians praise and blame in their reckless prose.\nLater generations fail to grasp the meaning of rise and fall—\nLook upon the old battleground in the river’s heart.\n\n---\n\n**Leisurely Verses, First Year of Xining (1068)**\n\nFortunate is the scholar who lives in a flourishing age,\nWhose home, though tiled, lies in the central capital.\nFleeting fame and hollow profit are not mine;\nGreen waters and blue mountains—where are they not found?\n\nTo choose a fine site, seek the fairest scenes;\nTo choose companions, select those who suit you.\nJoy in idleness is the idle man’s affair—\nYet it differs from stealing moments of leisure.\n\n---\n\nA six-foot frame, content in the present;\nHow can I bear to waste the four seasons’ fair days?\nIn the second and eighth months, the weather shifts between warmth and chill;\nWith three or five friends, we discuss the Dao and righteousness.\n\nMeasure your strength in cups and plates, set out simple fare;\nOpen your heart to laughter and speech, follow nature’s truth.\nI urge you: in such clear and idle matters,\nThough old, why grow weary of their frequency?\n\n---\n\nDo not let true qi aid sorrow and grief—\nThe indignant death of heroes only lengthens the age.\nThough many horses leap on the paths,\nBeyond the heavens, phoenixes soar.\n\nThree thousand guests may polish their jade edges;\nA hundred and two mountains may bear sword points.\nAll is but a spring dream passing—\nWhat else is worth lamenting?\n\n---\n\n**Awakening from Sleep by the South Window, Gazing at the Spring Mountains**\n\nWaking from sleep by the south window, I gaze at the spring mountains—\nAmid the mountains, mist and sleet mingle with haze.\nA thousand li cannot escape the clarity of these two eyes;\nIn a hundred years, I have not seen a single idle man.\n\nEmotions are like falling catkins, without high or low;\nThe heart is like wandering silk, drifting to and fro.\nI fear the hidden birds know this feeling—\nThus they come to the branches, murmuring softly.\n\n---\n\n**Who Has Entrusted Creation to the East Wind?**\n\nWho has entrusted creation to the east wind?\nOnce given to the east wind, affairs know no end.\nLate winter should prepare its plans;\nNew Year’s dawn must demand its achievements.\n\nWillow tips, warmed, sway gently;\nPlum buds, stealing spring, half-reveal their red.\nIf only the feelings of those times remained—\nLight robes fluttering amid the carefree young.\n\n---\n\n**Peach and Plum Verses**\n\nPeach and plum, stirred by the wind, fill the branches with blossoms;\nStirred by the wind, peach and plum scatter apart.\nSorrow and joy follow one another, never leaving my grasp;\nWorry and delight both reside in my brows.\n\nWhen prosperity reaches its peak, it must decline;\nWhen adversity reaches its nadir, it must turn.\nLet men of today cease to praise the ancients—\nIt is only because men of today were born too late.\n\n---\n\n**Heartbreaking Song**\n\nI know not what iron was forged into this needle—\nOnce forged, it pierces only the heart.\nI reckon the human heart is no more than an inch—\nWhen piercing, it must pierce to the fullest depth.\n\n---\n\n**Lament for Two Younger Brothers Who Passed Without Illness**\n\nThe love between siblings runs deep, unforgettable;\nEven cutting out my heart cannot compare to this grief.",

geese in flight break rank, their formation torn.\n\nFrom this night of moonlit winds and clarity,\nI gaze in desolation at the eastern fence—my heart breaks.\nMy two brothers lie buried beneath its boughs;\nLater, I found his poem from the Double Ninth:\n*\"Clothes white as the moon of yore,\nFlowers yellow as the years before.\"*\nI sought to ask the eastern fence of its tale,\nBut the fence’s tale had faded into mist—\nA language like an omen.\n\nWhere now to seek the eastern fence, my heart undone?\nFrom this day forth, its story sinks into silence.\nWhere once we walked abreast, all has passed away;\nNo sorrow now compares to this.\n\nTears have dried, yet grief knows no bound,\nThough the Yellow Springs lie not so deep.\nHow many days must pass ere it fades—\nThirty-two years of harmony and kinship?\n\n---\n\n**Another Poem**\n\nMy elder brother named *Yong*, my younger *Mu*—\nBrothers in harmony, yet was our bond enough?\nIn daily life, one always stayed behind,\nServing our parents, raising children as they wished.\nOur kind father lived to seventy-nine,\nFour young sons ever at his side.\nDo you recall the days we played in bright robes,\nWhile joy filled the hall, so full it could be cupped?\n\nTwo years ago, our father suddenly passed,\nAnd this year, your life was cut short too.\nNow a lone son attends our mother with four young ones,\nEach day facing the ancestral altar, weeping face to face.\nHow many *li* of intestines must I have,\nHow many *hu* of tears must I shed?\nAll spent, all shed—what can I do?\nThe sunlight of past kindness—how can it be repaid?\n\n---\n\n**A Quatrain**\n\nThe bond of siblings runs deep,\nThe joy of *xun* and *chi* long.\nTo know where it may be forgotten,\nSee the weeds upon their graves.\n\n---\n\n**Hearing the Cuckoo, Thinking of My Deceased Brother**\n\nI recall last year’s early summer,\nWhen we listened together to the cuckoo’s cry.\nThis year, the cuckoo returns again—\nIt is still the same early summer as before.\n\nEven birds know the depth of human longing:\nOne cry has not ceased before another begins in sorrow.\nMy heart, following this sound, is already broken—\nMy soul, chasing this bird, where does it fly?\n\n---\n\n**Inscription for My Deceased Brother Zan**\n\nAfter my coming, before my going.\nAt the moment of departure,\nThere was no yielding between us.\n\n---\n\n**Evening Stroll South of the Southern Garden, Thinking of My Deceased Brother**\n\nSouth of the southern garden, grass like a mat,\nI walk at dusk, the wind clear, no dust in sight.\nUnable to share this joy with you,\nI wonder if the clouds above are drifting from heaven.\n\nA fleeting piece of this world, come to be human,\nDrifting to and fro without cause.\nI pity myself—\n\n---\n\n**Self-Compassion**\n\nHeaven covers all without partiality, ancient and modern the same,\nYet the deep bond of siblings is suddenly emptied.\nFive or seven years of family hardship,\nAt sixty, my head winds still afflict me.\n\nCommon sense cannot escape worldly customs,\nPrivate plans are hard to entrust to servants.\nIf only the immortal’s old raft still remained—\nThe Yi River’s clouds and waters bring boundless joy.\n\n---\n\n**Self-Admonition in the Year Wushen**\n\nThough old, I still long to sing and beat the pot,\nHoping to preserve some measure of Heaven’s harmony.\n*Ming Yi* advises concealment—let it end here;\n*Wu Wang* warns of calamity—what can be done?\n\nTime flies like an arrow from my head,\nHuman affairs pass before my eyes like hemp.\nIf I do not take charge of myself now,\nThe losses to come will be even greater.\n\n---\n\n**Written on Behalf of Zhao Chongdao, Envoy to Beihai, in the Second Year of Xining**\n\nSince I ceased my recitations,\nI have but sung one vast song to the wind.\nParting is easy, reunion hard—my longing knows no end;\nAscending heights, gazing afar—what thoughts arise?\n\nA hundred years are fleeting, time does not return,\nA thousand *li* of longing bring even more cares.\nToday, this cup is truly the North Sea—\nHow many like you, so refined, have passed through?\n\n---\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Wang Buyi, Minister of Rites, in His Gift**\n\nI do not let sorrow burden the splendor of things,\nTime flies past my eyes swift as a chariot.\nFinding joy in contentment, I know my place;\nSeeking sufficiency for peace—when will it end?\n\nAfter meals, I sometimes wander the orchid garden,\nAfter sleep, with nothing to do, I visit the monks.\nThe wind and moon of Tianjin surpass other places—\nI long to share tea with you there.\n\n---\n\n**The Virtuous One’s Song**\n\nThe virtuous are hard to find, their thoughts steadfast;\nIn peace, take care not to presume you are unharmed.\nVying to be first on the path—how treacherous the schemes;\nLingering behind in speech—how rich the flavor.\n\nWhat tastes sharp often breeds illness,\nWhat pleases the heart often brings misfortune.\nBetter to seek medicine before falling ill\nThan to seek it after the disease has struck.\n\n---\n\n**Two Poems: Inviting Guests to Wine as the Early Plum Blossoms Bloom by the Eastern Pavilion**\n\n**I**\nI love the early plum more than the winter plum,\nA few branches blooming first, lingering in the sun.\nIf all on the southern ridges had faded before the year’s end,\nHow could Luoyang boast its blossoms in the new year’s turn?\n\nFragrance follows the warm wind, emerging from the valley,\nBeauty drifts upon the wine, floating in the cup.\nGather noble guests to grasp the Lord of Spring’s intent—\nDo not waste this moment of spring’s arrival.\n\n**II**\nSpring’s warmth fills Luoyang,\nDo not refuse joy to console this fleeting life.\nDeeply cherish wise friends who bring smiles,\nTreasure the plum blossoms shining bright before your eyes.\n\nMoreover, the old mountain hermit is somewhat fond of such things—\nHow pitiful the fragrant wine, so full of feeling!\nIf not drunk before the cup now,\nWhen else to drink to peace?\n\n---\n\n**Long Chant of the Pure Wind**\n\nIn the cosmos, the qi of harmony—\nPure and cool, beyond compare.\nWith the seasons, it dispels illness,\nFor the year, it brings abundant harvests.\n\nRising from the tips of green duckweed,\nComing from beside the emerald trees.\nOn a moonlit night, it meets me,\nThen enters the land of old friends.\n\nDense leaves sway like layered curtains,\nLush flowers dance in bright adornment.\nTwo or three distant flute notes,\nA thousand strands of drooping willows.\n\nSilken zither notes drift softly,\nDeep orchid fragrance lingers long.\nPavilions stand by distant waters,\nTerraces near tall bamboo groves.\n\nIn midsummer, it drives away the heat,\nAfter rain, it brings the evening cool.\nLightly parting green lotus leaves,\nGently penetrating thin robes.\n\nWaves stir sleeves in playful flight,\nRipples rise in glistening cups.\nIdle sorrows cannot cling,\nHidden thoughts take flight.\n\nSwift as riding the heavenly steed,\nSobering as sweet sugarcane juice.\nBefore me, I wander Penglai,\nAt my seat, I drift the Xiao and Xiang.\n\nCannot be bought with gold,\nNor measured by the *dou*.\nRelying wholly on virtue,\nStored without need of granaries.\n\nNo fear of monopolies,\nNo worry of bandits or thieves.\nMaking this my joy,\nI have never known sorrow.\n\n---\n\n**Long Chant of the Weeping Willow**\n\nWeeping willows come in two kinds—\nSome long, some short in their droop.\nOnly this long kind,\nIs most fitting for quietude.",

      "translated_text": "**Long Chant of the Weeping Willow**\n\nDeep in courtyards after spring’s retreat,\nIn pavilions when evening scenes unfold.\nToo frail to bear the mist’s thick shroud,\nHelpless before the lingering sun’s delay.\nA drizzling rain has just passed,\nA crisp, cool breeze now stirs.\n\nBy Zhangtai Street, east and west,\nPillars stand where avenues divide.\nRising eyes meet trees beyond the wall,\nBrushing heads, branches cross the path.\nSwaying like green silk ribbons,\nDrifting as if clad in golden threads.\nTossed and scattered, sunlit catkins fly,\nIn warm winds, tender strands dance bright.\n\nThreads tug at hearts, inch by inch they break,\nCatkins drift into ten thousand homes.\nGraceful as Wang Gong’s bearing,\nSupple as Zhao Feiyan’s sway.\nSlender and fair as young Zhang Xu,\nSoft and delicate as Shen Hou’s frail frame.\nLush and trailing, green sweeps the earth,\nFeathery and fine, jade fringes the pool.\n\nEnhancing blossoms’ fiery glow,\nEnticing grasses’ lush verdure.\nDense, they shroud the mountain lodge,\nSparse, they frame the tavern’s banner.\nGiven to others, all weep in turn,\nHorses neigh as riders pause to gaze.\nShadows swallow the creaking cart,\nBeneath their shade, wheels rumble home.\n\nMournful in the gathering dusk,\nFaint in the slanting light.\nVexed by careless plucking,\nGrieved by weighty partings.\nPrematurely withered, green lines the road,\nFirst to flourish where streams run near.\nBeyond the tower, cicadas just begin their cry,\nBy the bridge, orioles sing again.\n\nHating how they block the distant view,\nLoathing how they mimic painted brows.\nWandering strangers, countless in number,\nWhich long branch once bound whom?\nFrost-withered, all grow gaunt,\nYet next year, they’ll sway anew.\n\n---\n\n**Long Chant of Falling Flowers**\n\nWith wine, I battle flowers’ lushness,\nFlowers’ lushness makes the wine run deeper.\nFlowers fade in ten days’ time,\nYet not a hundred jars of wine are drained.\nStill gladdened by petals clinging to sleeves,\nStill cherishing those fallen into cups.\n\nOnly butterflies are truly passionate,\nBees are but fickle lovers.\nDiminished, the radiance on the wall,\nEnhanced, the crimson along the path.\nScattered through the deep courtyard,\nAdorning the quiet lattice.\n\nYet I fear they’ll follow the flowing stream,\nStill dread they’ll wed the distant wind.\nWater flows, ever winding,\nWind blows, now east, now west.\nTattered after late spring’s end,\nScattered in the fading light.\n\nThough pavilions have their masters,\nNo trace remains of galloping steeds.\nSwords depart with favored consorts,\nArmies besiege Shi Chong’s halls.\nAt Mawei, lingering regrets,\nAt Jingu, all is haste.\n\nCao Zhi’s verses grow ever poignant,\nKing Xiang’s dream has reached its end.\nFalsely they speak of seeking the Luo River’s shores,\nIdly they tell of counting Wu Mountain’s peaks.\nSwallows still voice their grievances,\nOrioles fail to carry messages.\n\nIf moss-coins could buy them back,\nWillow threads might mend their fate.\nGazing in vain at the true arbiter,\nMournful, I rail at nature’s craft.\nLet them bloom in wild abandon,\nNever granted even a moment’s grace.\n\nMy heart resists the sweeping broom,\nWords fail, my plans are spent.\nExquisite fragrance consumes the marrow,\nPeerless beauty slays the hero.\nBoast all you like of turning heaven’s will,\nVaunt your world-conquering deeds.\n\nYet time, once gone, cannot return,\nEvents, once past, are never repeated.\nBlooming and fading stand opposed,\nRise and fall share the same principle.\nThose who grasp heaven’s workings but shallowly\nCannot escape this restless longing.\n\n---\n\n**Long Chant of Fragrant Grass**\n\nLet fragrant grasses cease to grow,\nLet fragrant cups no longer pour.\nIf grasses grow without end,\nHow could the cup ever pause?\n\nAfter rain, in idle pavilions,\nDeep in spring, in small courtyard courts.\nAt this hour, curtains hang half-raised,\nIn this moment, wine just sobers the mind.\n\nTender shoots spread thickly,\nSoft green already takes shape.\nThey soften the last pale rays,\nSummon the light chill of dawn.\n\nQuietly gracing the flowered village,\nIdly adorning the bamboo grove.\nBy the stream, gentle waters lap,\nOn the plain, spring plowing has not begun.\n\nLet not perfumed carriages trample them,\nForbid fine steeds to tread here.\nLying upon them, endless thoughts arise,\nGazing long, emotions overwhelm.\n\nFrom distant terraces, brows first knit,\nFrom lofty towers, eyes suddenly brighten.\nLow, the evening clouds stretch blue,\nFaint, the distant mountains fade to green.\n\nEmerald meets the mandarin ducks’ shore,\nLush connects the willows’ isle.\nBy riverside piers, night sails drop,\nOn sea islets, evening boats lie crosswise.\n\nA single tune from the garrison’s horn,\nA few notes from the herdboy’s flute.\nOn sandy banks, a pair of egrets descends,\nAt the ferry, startled geese scatter.\n\nLush and dense, they cover the march’s route,\nTender and thick, they line the envoy’s path.\nFar and wide, they spread along the roads,\nEncircling every short and long pavilion.\n\nFading, the tomb of Qin’s First Emperor,\nScattered, the city of Han’s emperors.\nDesolate, the old Bronze Sparrow Tower,\nRuined, the former Golden Capital.\n\nMist veils the deeds of past dynasties,\nHaze dims the names of later ages.\nWithered, they still hide cunning hares,\nRotten, they yet breed fireflies.\n\nThough mown, how can they ever be gone?\nScorched, they sprout anew.\nVainly they cloak the burial mounds,\nYet still they long for peace.\n\n---\n\n**Long Chant of Spring Waters**\n\nSpring lingers where waters run clear,\nSpring departs, and swimming ceases.\nClearness does not fall short of purity,\nYet spring surpasses autumn’s grace.\n\nPurity found in sunlight’s warmth,\nClarity sought in the cold’s embrace.\nA degree beyond mere clarity—\nThus purity is deemed supreme.\n\nThin ice begins to float,\nLight rain just ceases.\nVast and boundless, new isles appear,\nGlistening, old shores gleam.\n\nLotus and water-chestnut leaves still droop,\nCattails and reeds now sprout.\nWater-shield and pondweed emerge,\nDuckweed and water-milfoil not yet dense.\n\nIn warm sun, mandarin ducks bathe,\nIn misty clarity, kingfishers glide.\nWaves calm, twin carp leap,\nWind still, gulls play in flocks.\n\nIn western Shu, outings vie in splendor,\nIn eastern Ou, purification rites are grand.\nThe Peach Blossom Spring is recognized anew,\nThe Han River’s girdle-pendants return.\n\nBeneath terraces, waters flow smoothly,\nBeside embankments, they wander endlessly.\nBefore railings, they barely ripple,\nBeyond the sky, they stretch ever onward.\n\nOverflowing, the heart grows troubled,\nMurmuring, the mind turns deep.\nDistant mountains cannot block their course,\nParting shores refuse to hold them back.\n\nBy the bridge in the second month,\nAt the wild ferry in the Three Wu lands.\nAs before, two oars lie crosswise,\nYet now they send a lone boat forth.\n\nThe painter lays down his brush,\nThe poet leans upon the tower.\nBeyond the Yangtze’s flying catkins,\nOnly parting sorrows stir.\n\n---\n\n**Long Chant of Flowers and Moon**\n\nIn youth, I craved but two lines of verse,\nAll worldly joys seemed folly then.\nNow I long to undo past regrets,\nYet how can my spirit match its former fire?\n\nEach time flowers bloom and the moon waxes full,\nWhat is this feeling that returns?\nIn such moments, without poetry or wine,\nI would rather die than awaken.\n\nWhen flowers meet the bright moon, their spirits soar,\nWhen the moon sees rare blossoms, their radiance unfolds.\nMan, flower, and moon become one,\nAnd I feel this body roam the jeweled realm.\n\nYet I fear the moon may be veiled by clouds,\nI dread the flowers may be torn by the wind.",

      "translated_text": "If poetry and wine are not taken up again,\nThis moment will slip by, becoming but a fleeting guilt.\nFortunately, there remains a long poem to gather,\nFortunately, there remains a clear wine flask to hold.\nWhen poem and wine flask are shared from time to time,\nIt is as if flowers and moon call to one another.\nWith flowers but no moon, the flowers age in sorrow,\nWith moon but no flowers, the moon resents its solitude.\nThe moon’s resentment can only be told through poetry,\nThe flowers’ sorrow relies entirely on wine to sustain.\nWhen not a trace of moon’s resentment or flowers’ sorrow remains,\nOnly then does one know the skill of poetry and wine.\nIn such carefree leisure beneath the trees,\nWho could fault this refined indulgence?\n\n**Visiting the Shangqing Palace with Prefect Li and Academician Ge**\nIn Luoyang’s second month, spring sways and drifts,\nPeach and plum bloom thick as marching screens.\nHigh blossoms and low blossoms link in crimson,\nWhile willows rise even above the highest flowers.\nLeisurely accompanying the Prefect beyond the city gates,\nWe sought the true palace on Mang Hill.\nNo longer seeing the imperial procession’s western journey,\nI stood in the wind all day, lost in melancholy.\n\n**Begging for Bamboo Flute-Plants from the Estate of Minister Li Shaobao**\nWildly planted, idle flowers claim the earth,\nNever deigning to linger with ease.\nYet how can one not love their frost-defying integrity—\nOr the name still carved upon the flute?\nWhen the phoenix arrives, they will bear fruit,\nWhere the dragon’s song is learned, can there be no sound?\nThis recluse begs for a few stalks to plant,\nTo gain honor from your noble house once more.\n\n**Chant of Longing for the Mountains**\nBehold the green mountains and white clouds,\nYet ponder the boundless merit they hold.\nWho knows the joy they bring, and for what reason—\nIs it merely to sate hunger with herbs?\nA thousand clumsy poems fail to express my grievance,\nA single cup of fine wine harbors spring anew.\nHow vast the days and months within the flask—\nHow many generations in the red dust grow old?\n\nI fear the body may be idle while the heart is not,\nYet if the heart is idle, why dwell in clouded mountains?\nIf truly at ease in nature’s embrace,\nWho would bury themselves in profit and strife?\nMy actions require no caution, no taboo,\nMy words need no artifice, no schemes.\nWho could have imagined joy would reach such heights—\nA heavenly steed leaves no trace, coming and going as it pleases.\n\n**Chant of Resenting the Moon**\nIt is not that I begrudge gold,\nBut that Chang’e loves inconstancy.\nJust before her ascent, she drips with dew,\nNo sooner full than the sky darkens.\nI lean on the railing again and again,\nPouring fragrant wine, then pouring once more.\nIf only I could confine her in the women’s quarters,\nYet how deeply she has misled me, before and after.\n\n**Chant of Sorrowing for Flowers**\nThree thousand palace ladies in their robes,\nEach hoping for favor, each lovely in her own way.\nAt first bloom, they seem delicate,\nHalf-opened, they become alluring and rich.\nBefore the heartwood reveals itself, fragrance already spreads,\nAs dew-laden powder falls, the soul melts away.\nFacing such a fragrant cup, how many thoughts arise—\nYet soon wind and rain will ride roughshod over them.\n\n**Matching Zhang Ziwang’s “Viewing Flowers in Luoyang”**\nCreation has never failed mankind,\nMyriad reds and purples reveal heaven’s truth.\nThe city teems with carriages and horses in vain chaos,\nFor not all who meet spring truly grasp it.\n\n**Short Chant on Falling Flowers**\nThe garden’s peach and plum scatter in disarray,\nFurther torn by a wanton wind.\nEver sorrowful when they first fade,\nYet one must recall their unopened beauty.\nAlas, how swiftly crimson splendor fades,\nUnlike the slow change of green shade.\nNinety days of spring have all but gone—\nHow can I bear to furrow my brow before the cup?\n\n**Short Chant on Fragrant Grass**\nBy flowered banks and waters, green as a mat,\nRising and falling through Han and Qin.\nClaiming endless land across mountains and rivers,\nHow many through the ages have grieved for them?\nThough severe frost kills, rain revives them,\nThough wildfire burns, spring returns.\nYet why does this plant thrive so abundantly by the road?\nFarmers forever weary of its encroachment.\n\n**Short Chant on Weeping Willows**\nBy the stream, brushing the water, they sway,\nFurther tossed by the relentless wind.\nAt dusk, they cannot bear the thickening mist,\nIn deep spring, they chafe at the lingering sun.\nWhose ethereal green silk scarf flutters?\nWhere do the golden-threaded robes dance?\nStill fearing the parting lover’s heart is not yet broken,\nThe sky fills once more with scattered blossoms.\n\n**Short Chant on Spring Waters**\nSnow melts, ice thaws, filling the channels,\nKingfishers and mandarin ducks revel in autumn’s pride.\nEver resenting distant mountains that block the view,\nYet doubting if the branching stream can detain them.\nWillows along the bank brush lightly,\nNew reeds by the shore sprout tenderly.\nEndless misty waves fill the eyes—\nThe Three Wu regions send forth a lone boat.\n\n**Short Chant on the Pure Breeze**\nThe pure breeze’s vigor has not yet fully waned,\nWho says heaven’s heart has cast it aside?\nEver steadfast in fasting and solemnity while studying the *Yi*,\nEver ashamed of my carefree ways when composing verse.\nThe world’s fine scenes all pass before my eyes,\nThe age’s idle sorrows never touch my brow.\nBorn in an era of peace, untroubled by strife,\nI grow old in these peaceful times.\n\n**Late Spring Letter to Li Shenyan, Dragon Diagram Scholar**\nYear after year, I dread the deepening spring,\nFor each time it deepens, my illness cannot bear it.\nA small gathering leaves me wounded by wine,\nThe weather for tending flowers favors light shade.\nThe years change as they always have,\nYet the seasons cannot turn back an aging heart.\nOnly the front pavilion is fit for quiet sitting,\nWhere I face the wind and long for old friends.\n\n**Early Summer Leisure Chant**\nIn the depths of green willows, orioles trill,\nTheir songs still able to delight in peace.\nIs it not fortune for one to enjoy long years?\nDoes heaven not feel for the rare treasures it creates?\nWhen peonies fade, purple cherries ripen,\nWhen peonies bloom, the *ban* orchids flourish.\nIn the grove, a kind of idle wealth and honor—\nWhy should I yield to dukes and ministers?\n\n**Letter in Reply to Judge Yao Fuzhou and Section Chief Zhou of the Kaifeng Prefecture**\nThe ways of the world often thwart our wishes,\nTo speak of advancement is to know nothing.\nBetter to ponder idle matters at leisure,\nThan to debate endlessly on West Street.\nEven with extraordinary talent to move the world,\nAlas, my temples are already silvered.\nThe new moon on the horizon has always been slender,\nNot for the sake of painting brows in the human realm.\n\nYour letter says: *\"I hope you take care of yourself, for I fear the woods will not long hold you.\"*\n**The Yi River’s “Striking the Earth” Collection, Volume Six Concludes**\n**The Yi River’s “Striking the Earth” Collection, Volume Seven**",
      "overlap_context": "past regrets,\nYet how can my spirit match its former fire?\n\nEach time flowers bloom and the moon waxes full,\nWhat is this feeling that returns?\nIn such moments, without poetry or wine,\nI would rather die than awaken.\n\nWhen flowers meet the bright moon, their spirits soar,\nWhen the moon sees rare blossoms, their radiance unfolds.\nMan, flower, and moon become one,\nAnd I feel this body roam the jeweled realm.\n\nYet I fear the moon may be veiled by clouds,\nI dread the flowers may be torn by the wind.",

      "translated_text": "**Written on Behalf of Shao Yong of Yichuan to Zhang Duhuan, Prefect of Haozhou**\n\nMuch ashamed, I too have found no kindred spirit—\nThough the music of heaven is heard, it permits no pursuit.\nMaster Hui’s political acumen was naturally keen,\nWhile Zhuangzi’s wanderings held profound intent.\nIn leisure, I briefly record the events of a spring;\nIn old age, my thousand-mile aspirations falter.\nAmong the friends of the Luo Society, when we meet,\nRecite for me the *White-Haired Lament*.\n\n**Three Responses to a Villager Declining Office**\n\nThrough life, I’ve done nothing to furrow brows—\nThe world should have no one who gnashes their teeth at me.\nWhy waste rain to hasten the fall of blossoms?\nHow could spring be needed to adorn old things?\nFortunate to live under Yao and Shun as true sovereigns,\nI let the recluses Chao and You remain outer ministers.\nA sick man of sixty should know his place—\nNo need for supervisory officials to press their appeals.\n\n**Matching the Rhyme of Vice Director Wang Anzhi**\n\nI fear my fellow villagers may not yet understand,\nBut once they know me deeply, what doubt remains?\nIn poverty, accepting salary is permissible;\nIn old age, taking office is hard to justify.\nI have my forests and streams to settle my plain aspirations;\nIn death, my lack of talent will not trouble the imperial court.\nIf Xun and Yang had upheld our Confucian bounds,\nThey’d have spared themselves Han Yu’s critique of minor flaws.\n\n**Matching the Rhyme of Liu Zhifang’s Gift**\n\nThe Creator’s craftsmanship holds profound intent—\nWhere I find joy is in the mountains and forests.\nIn youth, frequent illness kept me from seeking office;\nIn old age, lack of talent makes my heart unmoved.\nBy quiet waters, I walk amid flowers and moonlight;\nIn fragrant orchid breezes, I rest beneath pine shade.\nAt leisure by the window, I sleep at ease—\nWishing for enfeoffment or gold bestowed.\n\n**Written on Behalf of Wang Shengzhi, Academician, Thanking Him for the Gift of Lai Stone Tea and Wine Vessels**\n\nOn Eastern Mountain lies a stone like jade,\nWhich artisans carve to hold wine.\nYou, sir, obtained it but cherished it unused,\nAnd with great care sent it to this forest-dwelling elder.\nThis elder has always used clay cups—\nStartled, he dares not lift it with his hands.\nHe sternly warns his children not to damage it,\nSealing it away to await a worthy friend.\nYet I know not when that worthy friend will return—\nA man’s achievements remain unfulfilled.\nThe court first heeds the words of the concerned:\nToday, none compare to the two barbarian foes.\nThe Han’s six commanderies were bounded by Liaoxi,\nThe Tang’s eight prefectures cut off beyond the mountains.\nBeyond lie Gansha, Gan, and Liang—\nThe Central Plains have long been unable to reclaim them.\nWhy further bait them with gold and silk,\nBurdening our people and hindering our arms?\nWere it not for a bold strike from the court,\nHow could the frontier crush these decaying foes?\nDrive them out past their stinking lands—\nWest through Yumen, north beyond the passes.\nWith the foxes beneath the city walls gone,\nThe wolves on the roads will scatter of themselves.\nThe sun blazes bright on the celestial thoroughfare,\nWhile ominous vapors and shifting omens hide in dust.\nUpon success, he refuses the highest rewards,\nReturning his seal and gold greater than a peck.\nBegging leave of the sovereign, he departs the capital—\nHis homeward saddle brushes the willows of Heavenly Street.\nA thousand officials, like jade walls, block the road to detain him,\nBut he lifts his face, cracks his whip, and does not look back.\nVillagers line the road to welcome the great prefect;\nDrunk, he is borne by banners and gleaming brocade.\nAlighting, he visits his ancestors’ graves and resumes governance,\nYet does not call at the yamen—only at the homes of kin and old friends.\nOnly then do I know this vessel has its time of use—\nI shall offer it to you for long life.\n\n**At Chongde Pavilion, Responding to Various Gentlemen on Silent Chan**\n\nThe vast sky races with the sun’s wheel—\nWhy trouble yourself to distinguish root from dust?\nThe roc’s ten-thousand-mile journey needs no carriage;\nThe crane’s three-thousand-year lifespan has its own spring.\nAlchemy turns lead and tin to gold—yet it is false;\nPainting a horse in ink seeks truth in vain.\nLook upon this wind-whipped, freezing night—\nWho stands firm at the gate?\n\n**Leaning on the Railing of the Small Pavilion in the Celestial Palace**\n\nThis frail, six-foot frame, sick and weakened,\nFits the daily deepening of decline.\nAll the clarity I regret is in my heart—\nNot a word can be entrusted before it’s too late.\nGold lies hidden in sand, yet one must sift to find it;\nJade is embedded in stone—how can one doubt?\nThis sorrow lingers in the autumn dusk’s west wind,\nAs I lean on every railing, unknown to others.\n\n**Written on Behalf of Wu the Daoist of Yuntai Abbey, Huashan**\n\nThe central peak of Mount Hua soars five thousand *ren*,\nBeneath it, the great Dao sees travelers come and go.\nOne glance back from horseback in those days—\nA decade later, my dreaming soul still crosses the pass.\nAll my life, I’ve loved mountains, yet they never sate me;\nFrom here, I’ve seen all the mountains under heaven.\nTo find another like Mount Hua is rare—\nIt lets a man while away his whole life in leisure.\n\n**Written on Behalf of Zhang Wentong, Attaché in Chang’an**\n\nNo learning, no schemes—\nMy breast has long been empty.\nMy withered guts delight in wine;\nMy ailing eyes fear books.\nBy the Luo’s banks, wrapped in wind;\nAt Tianjin Bridge, after a light rain.\nAn old friend lies a thousand miles away—\nGazing toward him, what are my thoughts?\n\n**Matching a Poem on Hearing Han Weigong’s Departure to Govern Yongxing, Passing Through Luoyang**\n\nAiding three reigns as Grand Minister,\nHis name endures through ages as a foundational merit.\nHe nurtured peaches and plums across the world;\nHe rode the winds and waves through half the seas.\nIn the tiger’s tent, the night’s chill steels his heart;\nIn the Phoenix Pool, warm waves leave his post still vacant.\nThe sovereign’s reign is in its prime, with Guo Ziyi at hand—\nThe lands of He and Huang are not worth attacking.\n\n**Written on Behalf of Zhang Jingzhen, Salt Transport Commissioner of Baibo**\n\nAutumn enters the mountains and rivers with majestic air—\nI cannot bear this idle gazing in old age.\nOur golden friendship weighs heavily on my endless thoughts;\nThe bonds of brotherhood stir endless feelings.\nA half-finished game of chess passes the white day;\nA single hairpin of gray hair tangles in the west wind.\nOnly you and your father have known me long—\nOur pine and cassia hearts share the same hue.\n\n**Written on Behalf of Zhang Taibo, Magistrate of Yinjiang**\n\nI still recall that year sweeping our humble hut,\nBrothers together at the start of our official careers.\nA lifetime forgets the commonplace—\nYet a thousand miles still exchange letters as if face-to-face.\nI know from afar that the winds and moon of Siming are fine;\nThe rivers and mountains are even more so in late autumn.\nA single sail has not yet found time to fly free—\nIn vain, I see your father inquiring after me.\n\n**First Signs**\n\nTo recognize the first signs is to be one of us—\nBeware of lightly joining the world’s vulgar laughter.\nBetter to display clumsiness before the crowd\nThan to jest in solitude.\nA thousand strange flowers, in every form, yield to the eye;\nOne bright moon, a single wheel, always enters the heart.\nWith such moments, how could time be spent in vain?\nI know the joy of being human.\n\n**Western Pavilion in Late Autumn**\n\nAround the railings, chrysanthemums bloom in unison;\nDoors, windows, and pavilions are all fragrant.",

      "translated_text": "**In High Spirits**\n\nIn high spirits, one cannot but sing and chant;\nIn times of joy, one again encounters abundance.\nDeep autumn’s scenery is fittingly fine,\nAnd in old age, sinews and bones remain roughly sound.\nAfter drinking, why not ascend for a view?\nAmid piled rosy clouds lingers the setting sun.\n\n**Leisurely Stroll by the Heavenly Ford**\n\nWithin Luoyang’s walls, I roam freely east and west,\nTwenty years of indolence now fully spent.\nOld friends abound, their kindness warm and deep,\nWhile the capital’s grandeur exudes ease and grace.\nThe pond, level, resembles rivers and lakes;\nThe woods, still, evoke mountain valleys.\nNo need for deeds to shake the world—\nThe joy of quiet dwelling is boundless.\n\n**In Reply to Two Gentlemen of Chang’an, Zhang and Qiang**\n\nYour poems surpass treasures of linked cities,\nYet my talent falls short of Mi Heng’s.\nI thought my plight like the steadfast boat would never meet favor,\nBut now, to my surprise, I am honored with splendid robes.\nAfter rain on Min and E peaks, their sharpness is revealed;\nAfter frost on winds and moon, their clarity appears.\nAncients spoke of few who could respond—\nWas the \"White Snow in Spring\" an empty name?\n\n**Letter in Reply to Prefect Zhang of Huainan**\n\nSeeking fish by climbing trees is surely futile,\nBut seeking roasted fish by following fish may work.\nBetter to refuse the great goblet while drunk\nThan to seek fine medicine after falling ill.\nDo not plant rootless lingzhi—why bother?\nPeaches of immortality bear fruit without difficulty.\nYour kindness runs deep;\nA mustard seed’s honor is still honor.\n\n**Occasional Verse**\n\nThe consummate master refuses imitation,\nYet to act otherwise is to abandon the golden chariot.\nTo claim nothing is difficult under heaven\nIs to deny true men exist in the world.\nHeaven’s will aligns with the times for good measure;\nHuman nature finds peace in contentment.\nBetween heaven and man lies but a hair’s breadth—\nBeyond it, all is as distant as the Five Lakes.\n\n**Letter to a Friend**\n\nTwo decades have passed since we parted,\nYears like arrows—only sighs remain.\nThough long separated by hardship, east and west,\nWe exchanged earnest letters before and after.\nHomeland’s mountains and rivers live now in dreams;\nOld friends and kin lie half in ruins.\nWhen shall we recount those days again,\nLaughing into the west wind as we crack open wine jars?\n\n**Wind Blows the Leaves (Third Year of Xining)**\n\nThe wind blows the leaves, not the roots—\nBeware of bitterly pleading your roots’ case.\nThe Son of Heaven’s old capital is pleasant to dwell in;\nThe Sage’s lesser affairs are too trivial to discuss.\nIn the land’s long years, immortals are companions;\nIn the nest of peace, wealth and honor abide.\nHaving traversed ten thousand waters and a thousand mountains,\nReturning, I recognize my true self.\n\n**Leisurely Stroll**\n\nI often recall sweeping my humble hut in those days,\nNever letting the three paths grow wild.\nI wished to be the world’s dragon-slayer,\nBut would I read unholy books?\nUnderstanding fortune and misfortune, I knew when to advance or retreat;\nSeeing heaven and earth, I discerned near and far.\nOnce I grasped the Way’s circular nature,\nNot a trace of idle vexation remained in my breast.\n\n**Seeking the Azure Sky in Wu and Yue**\n\nYou rush to Wu and Yue to find the azure sky,\nUnknowing it lies before your eyes.\nTo see it with open eyes is still flawed;\nTo seek it with raised head is without cause.\nYan Yuan was in his \"like a fool\" days,\nMencius in his \"unmoved\" years.\nHow to find time to wander the jewel markets,\nLoving others’ pearls and jades while fretting over coins?\n\n**Buying Divination to Resolve Doubts**\n\nBuying divination is buying doubt—\nWith deep illness, what medicine can cure?\nDreams within dreams, layer upon layer of delusion;\nForests on beds, error upon error.\nLiezi riding the wind still depended on something;\nThe boaster chasing the sun surely grew weary.\nMuch toil, yet no achievement—\nI’ve trodden all the world’s idle paths.\n\n**Drinking Before Flowers**\n\nThey say beyond things lie misty clouds,\nBut are misty clouds beyond things worth boasting?\nIf you make comparisons your joy,\nThen freedom from care is the immortal’s home.\nA century’s fleeting light cannot be detained;\nTen days of fragrance depart unchecked.\nTo drink with flowers is no betrayal of wine;\nTo face flowers without wine is to wrong the flowers.\n\n**Strolling in the Rear Garden After Spring’s End**\n\nGreen trees form a canopy in the sun;\nYellow orioles converse in pairs.\nThe small channel shimmers freshly;\nNew bamboo stands in uneven rows.\nLeaning on my staff, I chant idly for long;\nWith a child in tow, my steps slow.\nThe fine breeze knows my intent,\nBlowing toward me again and again.\n\n**Letter to Wu Chuanzheng, Vice Magistrate**\n\nYour steadfast heart is rare in this world;\nThe events of that day, this year, are hard to trace.\nSnow and frost, though never mild, are not unbearable;\nPines and cassia never change their hues.\nScholars of Luoyi still trust me;\nOnly you know the winds and moon of Tianjin.\nMy dreaming soul, unaware of Luoyang’s distance,\nStill visits you as in days of old.\n\n**Gardens and Pools of Luoxia**\n\nThe gardens and pools of Luoxia need no gates;\nNo need to seek spring in other grotto-heavens.\nEven unrestrained wanderers cannot match the idle guest;\nWho asks the owner when entering everywhere?\nThe smaller pavilions’ railings frame flowers’ beauty;\nThe overgrown terraces reveal scenes’ truth.\nEmpty fame has misled endless affairs—\nNot all empty fame reaches one’s person.\n\n**Dream of Visiting the Eastern City to Call on Yang Yingzhi, Magistrate of Luoyang**\n\nLast night, a clear dream took me east of the city,\nWhere streams divided, paths ran straight.\nIt was like riding a raft on the Milky Way,\nBut without Yan Zi to verify my tracks.\n\n**Letter to Former Luoyang Recorder Lu Gangshu, Secretariat Drafter**\n\nWhen your term in Luoyang ended, you shook your robes,\nHow could dust defile your distant journey?\nFortunately, the Way meets with clear days and months;\nWith bright eyes, you should see old rivers and lakes.\nOnly the worthy know when to act and when to stop;\nTrue men can bend and stretch.\nWhy not return with the receding waters?\nThe three Wu regions remain as they were before.\n\n**Reply to One Requesting Green Reed**\n\nAmong praiseworthy grasses,\nDo not rank it with mugwort and wormwood.\nLush and spreading, it resembles bamboo;\nIts verdant hue suits autumn best.\nAt first rustling in wind and rain,\nIt stirs thoughts of rivers and lakes.\nThough it serves no use in the world,\nIt offers this brief respite.\n\n**Carefree Chant**\n\nThe Way is fundamentally level,\nYet few are willing to walk it.\nGaining the heart brings no rich flavor;\nLosing footing means deep pits.\nWithout penetrating heaven and earth,\nHow can one understand life and death?\nIn this matter,\nOne must be sincere and clear.\n\n**Human Life**\n\nPeople lament insufficiency,\nBut what more is there to seek beyond sufficiency?\nThough my life is not yet sufficient,\nIt is also free of care.\nHarmony with heaven is nurtured with wine;\nTrue joy is drawn forth with poetry.\nDo not doubt that time will hurry you—\nIt hastens men to early gray.\n\n**Preserving Harmony**",
      "overlap_context": " first signs is to be one of us—\nBeware of lightly joining the world’s vulgar laughter.\nBetter to display clumsiness before the crowd\nThan to jest in solitude.\nA thousand strange flowers, in every form, yield to the eye;\nOne bright moon, a single wheel, always enters the heart.\nWith such moments, how could time be spent in vain?\nI know the joy of being human.\n\n**Western Pavilion in Late Autumn**\n\nAround the railings, chrysanthemums bloom in unison;\nDoors, windows, and pavilions are all fragrant.",

ease;\nCultivating simplicity, I gain much from heaven.\nSun and moon submit to their ceaseless sway,\nMountains and rivers endure their endless carving.\nThose who seek to be such as this—\nWhen all is said and done, who are they?\n\n**What Moves Men Deeply**\n\nWhat stirs the heart so deeply?\nOne searches yet finds no trace.\nThe Two Modes ever rest in hand,\nThe myriad transformations no longer weigh on the mind.\nJade lies hidden within stone,\nGold is often found in sand.\nThough clear, it defies all reason—\nOne must sink into profound reflection.\n\n**An Impromptu Chant**\n\nA hair’s breadth apart,\nYet a thousand mountains, ten thousand peaks lie between.\nThough one may forget sleep and food,\nOne will not abandon the workings of the world.\nNot that I demand perfection of others,\nBut how hard it is to speak of this!\nThe heart of heaven is not far—\nYet once far, there is no return.\n\n**Each Time I Visit My Eastern Neighbor**\n\nEach time I visit my eastern neighbor,\nMy eastern neighbor grows ever more earnest.\nSince I come, I am always filled with shame;\nWhen we meet, we are as close as kin.\nFood and drink follow our preferences,\nEven the children obey of their own accord.\nIn my homeland there is such joy—\nWhy seek further benevolence?\n\n**Each Time I Pass the Eastern Street**\n\nEach time I pass the eastern street,\nThe eastern street resents my late arrival.\nAll we do is idle chatter,\nUnmindful of how freely we open our hearts.\nI possess a thousand joys,\nOthers harbor not a single doubt.\nHalf-drunk on joyful wine,\nIt is not yet late, yet I do not return.\n\n**The Noble Man in Fellowship**\n\nThe noble man in fellowship\nIs never without caution.\nThe petty man in fellowship\nIs never without fault.\nOnly this true joy\nShould be cherished and treasured.\nIn later years, when clouds and waters grow distant,\nIt may be hard to find again.\n\n**Heaven’s Two Qi**\n\nHeaven possesses two qi:\nOne yin, one yang.\nFrom yin’s error come serpents and scorpions;\nFrom yang’s harmony arise phoenixes.\nIf only serpents and scorpions would die,\nThey would no longer bring calamity to men.\nIf only phoenixes would be born,\nThey would forever bring good fortune to the state.\n\n**No Guest Can Alter Heaven’s Will**\n\nNo guest can alter heaven’s will,\nYet some provide provisions for thieves.\nAt midday, brawls are often seen;\nIn the sixth month, frost descends.\nBooks lie unread,\nFood goes untasted.\nMeals barely fill a jar,\nBooks pile empty upon the bed.\n\n**Love of Life, Fear of Death**\n\nTo hate death and love life—\nSuch is the constant nature of past and present.\nIf men’s hearts could give rise to affairs,\nThe world would know no war.\nEven grasses and trees flourish in harmony;\nHow could mountains and rivers not be at peace?\nWhy then is there no joy in plow and cup,\nNo celebration of peace?\n\n**Releasing the Small Fish**\n\nTiny and frail, not worth keeping—\nTo lose this is to lose a life.\nI release you to rivers and lakes,\nWhere you may swim freely, far from pot and cauldron.\nBeware the nets that lie deep,\nTake care not to mistake the hook.\nThe world is full of those who cook—\nDo not let yourself become their dish.\n\n**Matching Rhymes for Minister Tian’s Gift**\n\nEach day I stroll my garden,\nWhere the pure wind costs nothing.\nAmid the city, I find rustic scenes,\nBeneath the bamboo, I play with flowing springs.\nThough I see no cause for sighing,\nWhy not nurture my boundless spirit?\nYet I am ashamed before the scholars of the world—\nTheir words on the Dao have not forgotten the fish-trap.\n\n**Begging for Bamboo to Make a Flute**\n\nThe people of Luoyang love to plant flowers,\nWhile I alone love to plant bamboo.\nThough our loves differ,\nOur hearts are equally content.\nFlowers bloom red for but ten days,\nBamboo stays green through the years.\nBoth receive the grace of rain and dew,\nYet only bamboo escapes the shame of frost and snow.\n\n**Matching Rhymes for Secretary Wang Buyi’s Invitation to Drink**\n\nThrough hardship, I recall Master Fuqiu,\nYet my homeland offers ample delight.\nBefore the wind, I am startled by white hair;\nAfter the rain, I welcome the new autumn.\nThough my official ambitions are faint,\nMy joy in climbing heights never fades.\nThe world’s vain worries\nNever reach my heart.\n\n**Again Matching Rhymes for Secretary Wang Buyi’s Gift**\n\nThe weather turns cool and fine—\nWhere is there a place not fit for wandering?\nOn the day the wild geese arrive as guests,\nThe hawk’s ambition stirs in autumn.\nForgetting form, we revel all night;\nOne misstep, and a life is lost.\nHow many on rivers and lakes\nHave yet to reach their journey’s end?\n\n**Matching Rhymes with the Three Secretaries Wang Visiting My Humble Abode**\n\nTo be content is to find beauty in certainty.\nIn Luoyang, poetry has its society,\nAnd verses flow like divine speech from horseback.\nWhite-haired, our friendship runs deep;\nYellow chrysanthemums mark the season’s renewal.\nTo be visited warms the heart;\nTo feel shame is to know the Dao is not pure.\nAmid the desolate western wind,\nWith leisure, I am half an ancient man.\n\n**A Letter in Place of Writing to Censor Lü Xianke of Nanyang, Guardian of the Imperial Counsel**\n\nTwo cycles of stars and frost have passed since we parted,\nOur rise and fall unmarked by word or sound.\nIn the groves, laughter and talk must return to me;\nThe world’s peace and peril should rest with you.\nBefore the Son of Heaven, you often speak boldly;\nOn Hundred-Flower Isle, you move with ease.\nI wonder, on nights of white moon and clear wind,\nIf you recall the old fisherman of Yi River.\n\n**To Attendant Wu Chuanzheng**\n\nHow lonely the wind and moon of Tianjin Bridge!\nLike me, do you remember them after autumn’s passing?\nEach time I rely on the clear waves to send my voice,\nI wonder if it ever reaches the Eastern Capital.\n\n**To Former Registrar of Luoyang, Lu Gangshu, and Collator**\n\nHaving completed your term in Luoyang, you return to Wu and Kuaiji,\nA man of grand ambition, your aspirations yet unfulfilled.\nWhen you reach the finest landscapes,\nRaise your cup without hesitation and gaze toward Tianjin.\n\n**Matching Rhymes for Censor Zhang of Huainan**\n\nThe courtyard wutong leaves half-yellow,\nThe chrysanthemums by the fence just receive the frost.\nAs evening approaches, my mood turns heavy;\nI take up my wine and gaze southwest.\nI gaze for you but do not see you—\nOnly the wild geese flying south.\nJust as I think to send a letter,\nA few lines form of their own accord.\n\n**Written the Day Before the Double Ninth**\n\nLately, illness has left me speechless,\nLonging only to drowse in drunken sleep.\nNew wine arrives just in time for the Double Ninth,\nFine blossoms greet the season of Little Spring.\nI know my fate is meager, looming overhead,\nAnd wish no more affairs would come before my eyes.\nOnly the setting sun over Tianjin Bridge remains,\nThe sound of water still murmuring as of old.\n\n**On the Double Ninth, Ascending the Stone Pavilion (Three Poems)**\n\n**I**\nHuman feelings, once seen, are many;\nWorldly ways, long known, are familiar.\nAfter the fact, one gnaws with regret;\nAt the loss of things, one guards against hindrance.\nMuddy water must be settled and strained,\nDusty clothes must be shaken and brushed.\nIf one must discuss the helmsman,\nWho is truly skilled?\n\n**II**\nEvents arise in a moment,\nOnce past, they cannot return.\nAt the time, they seem deeply lovable;\nAfterward, they are unbearable to behold.\nSummer departs—no need to speak of heat;\nWinter comes—then one discusses the cold.\nIf men could grasp this principle,\nWorries and troubles would find no purchase.\n\n**III**\nOn this year’s Double Ninth,\nLeaning on the railing, the air feels slow.\nThough clouds and mist have grown faint,\nThe woods have not yet wholly withered.",

of drink to leave while dusk grew late,\nI slept amid the mist and clouds of Water-Crystal Hall.\n\n---\n\n**Touring Longmen with Wang Anzhi, Vice Minister**\n\nBy nature fond of seeking secluded spots,\nI visit Dragon Mountain four or five times a year.\nWhether coming or going, I keep no count—\nNo worldly gain could make me linger there.\n\nFor days we lingered, watching the Yi’s flow,\nThen divined a night on Incense Mountain’s stone tower.\nA cool breeze stirred thoughts of distant things,\nAnd misty rain played with the high autumn air.\n\n---\n\n**Returning to the City, Again in the Same Rhyme**\n\nIn high spirits, I explored Dragon Mountain’s depths,\nAs if wandering through a painted scene.\nRegretting no fine wine to match the view,\nJust when I wished to stay, I could not remain.\n\n---\n\n**Another Poem**\n\nEarly autumn’s light rain brings a gentle chill,\nI lean on the eastern pavilion’s railing.\nWho would have thought, amid such misty haze,\nThe pine study would seem a painted scroll?\n\n*(The Pine Study, home of Anzhi’s younger brother, lies west of the water.)*\n\n---\n\n**Inscribed for Minister Zhang’s Hermitage**\n\nHaving served as the Three Dukes and lived long,\nHe ranks first in human blessings and virtue.\nYet his thatched hut still recalls his lord—\nRight before the Ten-Thousand-Year Peak of Mount Song.\n\n---\n\n**A Letter on Behalf of Cheng Zhengshu**\n\nYour venerable father governs west of Sword Gate,\nHis filial joy a model for the world.\nThe Tang ministers’ grandeur is still clear today,\nWhile Shu’s people revel in past prosperity.\n\nWhere the Begonia Isle’s oars once paused,\nBy Golden Wild-Goose Bridge his horse once stood.\nI know he frets over the realm’s affairs—\nWho else but you would not forget your lord?\n\n---\n\n**Year’s End, Self-Admonition**\n\nOnce my ambitions soared like autumn’s might,\nNow, recalling them, I blush with shame.\nAll forced schemes end in petty toil,\nWhile the true Dao, unattained, drifts far away.\n\nIn stillness, one’s essence is hard to hide;\nIn old age, books gain deeper savor.\nAt ease, I converse with guests,\nYet piled memorials mislead lords and nobles.\n\nFortunate to be seen with favor by the wise,\nI heed not my wife and children’s complaints of gray hair.\nHow dare I compare to Zheng Zhen of Valley Mouth?\nOr scheme like the youths of Shouling?\n\nCauldron’s dragons and tigers, neglected in guard,\nChessboard’s rivers and mountains, abandoned in play.\nAwakening from a nap by the sunny window,\nA few soft bird calls just cease.\n\nThe finest woods and springs are bought with verse,\nThe fairest winds and moons repaid with wine.\nThree hundred and sixty days fly like arrows—\nHow could I let my heart sink into idle sorrow?\n\n---\n\n**Joyful Song, Fourth Year of Xining (1071)**\n\nAt sixty-one, my body is not yet frail.\nI’ve lived through two generations—\nHow could this be called an early end?\nMoreover, I am still hale,\nAnd free from care or vexation.\nWhy should I not rejoice?\nFine days are not few.\n\n---\n\n**To Li Jingzhen, Grand Master**\n\nBy the flowers, a quiet couch for idle rest,\nBeneath the bamboo, a bright window for solitary thought.\nWhat need for words to proclaim “the house is at peace”?\nThe green birds in the grove already know.\n\n---\n\n**Reflections**\n\nSnake’s head and lizard’s tail are not the same—\nKilling many is deemed a merit.\nThe four seasons’ winds and moons are infinitely fair—\nDo not let idle matters trouble your heart.\n\n---\n\n**To Qin Boming, Minister of War in Bozhou**\n\nThe land of Three Rivers lies at the center’s sun,\nIts qi nurtures rare blossoms to royal splendor.\nA connoisseur of fine flowers is not far—\nAnd fine flowers, ungrudging, offer full fragrance.\n\nFor years, worldly affairs have piled up,\nWhy frown before the blossoms?\nA thousand schemes turn hair to white—\nBetter to leave the heart unburdened.\n\nAmid boundless winds and moons, so full of feeling,\nLet rich wine flush your face.\nYet men create their own doubts and barriers,\nWeighing gains and losses, setting more traps.\n\nThough poor, I sleep late without harm;\nOthers may fret, but I am at ease.\nTempering worldly passions brings moments of joy—\nAnd fresh poems still number in the hundreds.\n\nWhere the heart returns is where the heart is absent,\nYet when the heart is absent, where can it be found?\nIf absence of heart meant absence of affairs,\nWhy then does gold form in water?\n\n---\n\n**Wine Holding Flower Shadows**\n\nWine brims with crimson, filled with flower shadows,\nPoured into the harmony of heaven and earth within my breast.\nI love best that singular savor—\nHalf-drunk, I am one with the Great Beginning.\n\n---\n\n**Another Farewell Poem**\n\nQin’s First Emperor once unified the Nine Provinces,\nYet the Nine Provinces soon passed to Liu.\nLet others boast of their brilliance—\nThey merely toil in vain, their hair turning white.\n\n---\n\n**Thinking of an Old Friend**\n\nThough the winecup is full,\nAn old friend a thousand *li* away—what can I do?\nWillows trail by the pavilion, their branches slender,\nFlowers near the eaves, their fragrance richer.\n\n---\n\n**Thanking Professor Wang Pingfu for Tea and a Poem on Flower-Viewing**\n\nThe Grand Academician knows flowers well,\nAnd in their essence, finds it through tea.\nAfter brewing amid ten thousand reds’ fragrance,\nHe sends the finest to the Celestial Ford’s first household.\n\n---\n\n**Viewing Flowers at Nanyuan**\n\nOn the third day of the third month, flowers in full bloom,\nI climb the spring terrace with kin and old friends.\nUsually sober, now I am drunk—\nAnd even drunk, I can still raise a great cup.\n\nBefore the flowers, I drink; before the flowers, I grow drunk,\nDrunk, I grasp the flower branches and sing.\nLet the flowers not laugh at this white-haired man—\nThe white-haired man has seen many fine flowers.\n\n---\n\n**Admiring Peonies Alone**\n\nViewing flowers is easy; knowing them is hard.\nOnly the connoisseur leans on the railing.\nIn rain and dew’s work, one sees creation’s art,\nIn immortals’ ranks, their beauty is fixed.\n\nCommon blooms may be called fashionable,\nBut only the extraordinary are deemed transcendent.\nOne’s allotted share is not shallow—\nIt takes a lifetime of leisure to deserve them.\n\n---\n\n**Asking Spring**\n\nIn the third month, spring departs and cannot be detained,\nSpring’s departure—how can its intent be entrusted?\nAll who speak of returning must return home—\nWhere, then, is spring’s home?\n\nWhere, after all, does spring return?\nCountless spring grievances remain unspoken.\nI would entrust the warbler to ask the reason,\nBut the cuckoo cries, “Better to go!”\n\nSpring comes, sorrow departs—all for the flowers;\nSpring goes, sorrow arrives—then clings to wine.\nLong resenting sorrow’s weight and wine’s weakness,\nDoes spring, now ill, know the flowers’ plight?\n\n---\n\n**Self-Admonition in the Peaceful Nest**\n\nThings, when well grasped, end in beauty;\nAffairs, when cunningly schemed, lack justice.\nNot stirring waves in the world,\nOne keeps ice and coals from the heart.",

flowers and not drink wine\nIs to let joy dwindle away.\nDrink wine before the flowers,\nAnd view them best when drunk.\nTo not drink wine before the flowers\nIs to waste a year’s delight.\n\n**After Writing *The Supreme Principles Governing the World***\n\nSimplicity scatters, and the human Dao is established;\nLaws begin with the Sovereign Fuxi.\nYears and months shift and change,\nYet records are hard to verify in detail.\nThe Two Emperors initiated abdication,\nThe Three Kings rectified the social order.\nThe Five Hegemons relied on strategic terrain,\nThe Seven States vied for supremacy.\nThe Two Han soared like dragons and phoenixes,\nThe Three Kingdoms fled like tigers and wolves.\nThe Western Jin indulged in refinement,\nWhile rebels flocked to the northern wastes.\nThe Eastern Jin cultivated purity,\nPassing its fragrance to Song, Qi, and Liang.\nBy the time of Chen, it was not worth reckoning—\nThe southern lands became a scene of sorrow.\nLater Wei exploited Jin’s weakness,\nSweeping away chaos to bring brief peace.\nYet before long after moving to Luoyang,\nRumors spread of eastern and western generals.\nNorthern Qi raised its flickering torch,\nLater Zhou raced like a shooting star.\nSui achieved unification,\nPaving the way for mighty Tang.\nThe Five Dynasties passed like inns,\nThe realm plunged into turmoil.\nHad no true lord emerged,\nHow could the

festered in vital organs.\nLaughter and talk sowed strife,\nFeasts and banquets opened battlefields.\nA single outburst of desire,\nA clash of profit and harm.\nFierce struggles led to devouring,\nEndless calamities ensued.\nMountains and rivers barely marked the land,\nTombs and mounds soon lay desolate.\nBrambles were hard to clear,\nOrchids and irises failed to flourish.\nDragons and snakes slithered across the plains,\nJade and stone mingled on Kunlun’s slopes.\nThose who planned well were called Zhou or Confucius,\nThose who harmonized were deemed Lao or Zhuang.\nYet how can one speak of one’s own afflictions?\nHow can all cares be forgotten?\n\n**Gathering to Drink in the Dao**\n\nWhat the crowd delights in\nIs but clamor and dust.\nWhat my friends delight in\nIs pure

white.\nThe pale moon goddess dances with slender waist,\nWhile deep in the white jade hall, another melody begins.\nThe scholar by the jarred window clutches his books,\nThe armored soldier on the battlefield moves in silence.\nThe reclusive man, his bones thin, nears emaciation—\nFortunate to have, now and then, a cup of wine.\n\n**The Small Cart**\n\nWhy not drink a thousand days’ wine in

Exchange**\n\nThroughout life, in dealings with others,\nNever once have I tasted bitterness.\nI have never wronged another,\nNor have others ever harmed me.\n\n**Chant of Knowledge**\n\nWhat the eye sees is called perception,\nWhat the ear hears is called knowledge.\nYet how rare in this world\nAre true knowledge and perception.\n\n**Occasional Verses**\n\nIn wind, the forest has no still branches,\nOn wind, the pond has no calm waves.\nIf forest and pond are never still,\nWhat then of birds and fish?\n\n**Chant of Anticipating Misfortune**\n\nServants bully their masters,\nBarbarians invade the Central Kingdom.\nSince ancient times, injustice has been known,\nYet none can ever wholly eradicate it.\n\n**Two Poems Sent to Wang Xuanhui of Sancheng**\n\nThough my forest dwelling is humble,\nBefore the flowers, I drink often.\nIn this world, joy belongs to those without affairs—\nYet I fear it belongs only to the idle.\n\nDust rises on the road to your chamber,\nWhile in my pot, flowers just bloom.\nWhy wait until my hair is fully white\nBefore composing my homecoming verse?\n\n**Chant of Benevolence and Sagacity**\n\nTo exhaust the Dao is called sagacity,\nTo be like heaven is called benevolence.\nYet how is it that benevolence and sagacity\nDare not be matched in this world?\n\n**Matching Xing Heshu, Academician, Upon Parting**\n\nHow vast the world’s road stretches eastward—\nWe meet without needing words to convey.\nYou compare yourself to Zhuge Liang,\nWhile I am no Yellow Stone Elder.\n\nIn expounding the Dao, high or low, no matter great or small,\nIn speech, rise and fall have their beginnings and ends.\nTalent and achievement must be cherished in comings and goings—\nBeware of lightly following the ways of Western Jin.\n\n**Chant of Striking the Earth**\n\nThey say there are immortals in grottoes,\nBut tales of grotto immortals may be false.\nIf one awaits the ninefold elixir,\nOr seeks the vermilion crest for a thousand years—\n\nIn the Land of Longevity, a thousand trees of flowers,\nIn the Nest of Peace, joy overflows.\nWith joy, flowers, and wine,\nI doubt not that I am a grotto immortal.\n\n**Chant of Spring’s Departure**\n\nFine things are hard to come by,\nYet all vanish in a few days.\nFirst tossed by wind,\nThen ravaged by rain.\n\nThe drunkard awakens from wealth’s stupor,\nThe dream of immortality suddenly fades.\nThe wanderer, unaware of when to stop,\nStill leans on the crimson balustrade.\n\n**Flowers and Bamboo in the Southern Garden**\n\nFlower paths and bamboo trails press close together,\nEach day I walk them four or five times.\nI let the flower paths encroach on the bamboo,\nThat the bamboo trails may face the blooming flowers.\n\nFragrance drifts far, clinging to sleeves,\nBamboo shadows layer upon the wine cups.\nWho says the mountain elder lacks warmth?\nSuch reds and greens ever embrace.\n\n**Two Responses to Wang Xuanhui**\n\nOur Confucians have their own joy,\nYet few are willing to follow it.\nTo take Chan as joy\nIs but to raise another layer of dust.\n\n**Again**\n\nThe greatly enlightened are truly unobstructed,\nEach person has their own home.\nEven false flowers occupy the mind—\nWhat then can be called true flowers?\n\n**Azure Chant: Sent in Reply to Li Shenyan, Dragon Diagram Scholar of Caozhou**\n\nThe same hue, ever azure,\nFrom ancient times to now, people gaze and cry out in sorrow.\nSun goes, moon comes, with little change,\nYang’s warmth and yin’s chill do not hinder each other.\n\nAfter thunder’s swift crack, mountains and rivers split,\nWhen sweet dew falls, grasses and trees grow fragrant.\nIn dark cliffs, ghosts and demons arise,\nOn clear plains, phoenixes appear.\n\nA thousand flowers bloom in spring’s rain,\nTen thousand trees wither in a night’s frost.\nThis meaning is hard to fathom—\nOnly the worthy can enter its depths.\n\n**Five Chants from the Forest**\n\nThe true artisan of creation allows no favoritism,\nThe clumsy schemer’s plans are ever slight.\nAfter rising from my Nest of Peace,\nHalf-drunk on the rich brew of Great Harmony.\n\nIn the Land of Longevity, I go with basket in hand,\nIn the Land of Ever-Ripe Grain, I return with staff.\nMy body, like the age of peace, knows no trouble—\nA few white whiskers let the wind blow as it will.\n\n**Old Age**\n\nThe body of old age demands warmth,\nIn the Nest of Peace, spring is ever present.\nAll affairs leave the heart, free to recline or rise,\nMy four limbs obey me, stretching or bending.\n\nWhere garden flowers bloom thick, cool mats are spread,\nWhen eaves snow flies, soft quilts are laid.\nWho says the mountain elder is clumsy in use?\nHe too can nurture his own well-being.\n\n**The Light and Pure**\n\nThere is a thing, light and pure, called Great Harmony,\nHalf-drunk, it best captures spring’s abundance.\nCan the elixir of immortality truly change bones?\nCan ascending to heaven in broad daylight be so?\n\nWhen joy is full, I rise and dance,\nAt the point of forgetting words, I only sing.\nDo not blame friends for my lack of restraint—\nTrue joy assails the heart, and I cannot help it.\n\n**Inviting Each Other**\n\nWe invite and urge each other to drink rosy clouds,\nHair tangled like autumn frost, temples streaked with blossoms.\nWhat we recall are but past years,\nMost of what we’ve experienced belongs to old officials.\n\nTogether we praise the grandson’s visit today,\nSpeaking again of old times.\nWords are tender, full of feeling—\nLet not the young laugh at our fussing.\n\n**Born Without Tilling**\n\nBorn without ever tending fields,\nYet every year, every season, there is harvest.\nWith cups and plates as they come, all is joy,\nCasual ponds and pavilions become excursions.\n\nWind, flowers, snow, moon—worth a thousand gold,\nWater, bamboo, clouds, mountains—worth ten thousand households.\nAwaiting the Yellow River’s clarity, how long can man live?\nHow much sorrow can the brows bear?\n\n**Self-Admonition in the Nest of Peace**\n\nI do not lash my whip toward the red dust,\nSeeking only to reduce faults, yet still without means.\nIn vain, I recall the days of knowing my errors,\nMistakenly passing the years reading the *Yi* with Confucius.\n\nWhen hair turns white, it’s hard to receive color,\nWhen the heart attains thoroughness, what more is there to say?\nThe qi of utmost yang becomes jade—\nYet I fear the drilling and polishing are not yet firm enough.\n\n**Two Poems Matching Junshi, Minister of the Flower Hermitage**\n\nNo need for cinnabar pillars or carved beams,\nLayer upon layer, green shade naturally hangs.\nLater generations, inheriting this natural intent,\nShould not seek to add embellishment with planted shade.\n\nBehind and before the hermitage, all is planted with flowers,\nBlooming in turn, lovely in all four seasons.\nThe master’s affairs are simple, often at leisure—\nHe does not believe that the years can age him.\n\n*Yichuan Jirang Ji,

      "translated_text": "**At Sixty-Two, by Shao Yong of Yichuan**\n\nAt sixty-two, still hale and strong,\nDeath but returns me to the land of eternal ripeness.\nFair scenes and fine hours are not easily won—\nWhat harm in sipping lightly and singing low?\nBoundless years defy all constraint,\nFrail flesh and bone must not be harmed.\nHow many heroes have wielded wit and skill—\nYet few have pondered deeply the ills they bring.\n\n**Chant on the Game Beneath the Trees**\n\nEven the idle have their duties,\nAnd these four fill my days:\nOne, to greet dawn’s dew and watch the flowers;\nOne, to welcome evening’s breeze and gaze upon the willows;\nOne, to face the bright moon and chant poems;\nOne, to keep fine guests and pour the wine.\nFor twenty years I’ve lived thus—\nWho among my peers could match this life?\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Attendant Councillor Wu Chuanzheng’s Gift**\n\nFifty years spent poring over old books—\nThe world must think me dull and out of touch.\nYet I recall the weaver’s daughter, lost in time,\nAnd grasp the wheelwright’s art of swift and slow.\nMy Daoist practice lacks refinement—this is my true flaw,\nThough my livelihood is meager, I dare not call it vain.\nIn this age of harmony, I’ve received much—\nHow could my heart not rest in perfect ease?\n\n**Poem for Academician Li of Yanfu Ward, Who Requested My Garden and Pond**\n\nNineteen times the banners of might were unfurled,\nA family of meritorious generals through the generations.\nIn this peaceful age, you left glory behind to return home,\nWhite-haired, passing the years in joy.\nCups brim with fragrant wine, afloat on spring waters,\nNew melodies rise from the depths of fair blossoms.\nWith such a garden, such a pond, such longevity—\nYour descendants fill your eyes with boundless blessing.\n\n**Chant on Gold and Jade**\n\nFine gold and fair jade are never paired by chance,\nThe finest things often lie buried deepest.\nRobber Zhi wielded troops yet did no good,\nWhile Confucius, landless, was met with suspicion.\nIf *zhongfu* demands trust to be true,\nWhy does *wuwang* bring disaster in its train?\nBetter to treat them as matters external—\nThe wellspring of the heart is joy, radiant and clear.\n\n**Summer Day in the Southern Garden**\n\nSummer trees, uncounted in their layers,\nCast deep shade where emerald leaves droop low.\nA hundred birds call to one another—\nMost are orioles, their voices bright.\n**For Attendant Councillor Xie of the Southern Office, Who Sent a Vessel of Xi Yi’s Wine**\n\nThe peaks of Xian Zhang stand sheer, unyielding,\nSince Xi Yi and Chen Tunan passed, none have matched them.\nThey poured with a hand raised high for worldly affairs,\nSipped with a tilt of the head for human feeling.\nTo paint a tiger and fail—yet the heart remains;\nTo mourn the qilin with no response—tears stream down.\nBut enlightenment comes without many words—\nThe first prize is to win this pure leisure.\n\n**Matching Junshi, Minister of the Flower Hermitage, on Sitting Alone**\n\nSitting in stillness, nurturing the harmony of Heaven,\nI have gained much from this practice.\nVast as a hall, yet dense with vines and creepers,\nI forget the bearing of a noble minister,\nAnd can welcome even rustic visitors.\nBound by the times’ joys and sorrows,\nIn the end, I know not what to say.\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Capital Official Song’s Gift of a Palm-Leaf Whisk**\n\nLuoyang has long been called a secondary capital,\nYet it has sheltered even one as unworthy as I.\nWhere countless mosquitoes hum like thunder,\nHow can a single whisk hope to sweep them all away?\n\n**With Academician Wang Shengzhi, Admiring the Peonies of the Western Garden**\n\nThis flower is famed in Yangzhou,\nBut here by the Luo River, it is prized above all.\nI know well its royal beauty can move all things,\nAnd its heavenly fragrance binds men’s hearts in secret.\nIt crowns the host of blossoms, reigning through summer,\nHolding its rare perfection without need of spring.\nAs the sun slants low, I mount my horse to leave—\nYet turn once more to lean on the crimson rail and gaze.\n\n**Playfully Thanking the Wealthy Minister for His Gift of Banana and Bamboo Shoots (Three Poems)**\n\nA renowned garden where not even crows may fly,\nYet now the Minister deigns to send for me.\nFeasts from tripods have long been called wealth and honor—\nNow he pairs them with flowers and bamboo shoots.\n\nYou send great shoots to startle me,\nWhile my small garden yields none at all.\nThough I’ve striven to temper my nature,\nHow can I remain unmoved today?\n\nThe work of responding to things lies beyond the world—\nWho can force their way to such heights?\nI am but a man who knows not his limits,\nSeeking to heap molehills to match Mount Tai.\n\n**In Reply to Li Xichun, Field Officer**\n\nThough born in prosperous times, what can I do?\nMy nature and wit are too slight for great deeds.\nMy flawed disposition suits only the curling of the inchworm,\nMy meager talent dares not aspire to the flight of the roc.\nOften I visit old friends, joy without end,\nOr seek quiet places, returning late at dusk.\nI love flowers best when half-open, touched by dew—\nYet how can I bear the dew that soaks my robe?\n\n**Moss-Coin**\n\nAfter each rain, it renews itself,\nNot through frequent minting.\nThough plentiful, it cannot be given to guests,\nAnd if lost, no one suspects theft.\nCovering the ground does not make one rich,\nFilling the steps cannot relieve the poor.\nTo drown sorrow, one must have a cause—\nTo buy wine, there is no reason at all.\nScattered, it resembles counting rods;\nPiled high, it seems a tangled rope.\nUnable to aid one’s own urgent needs,\nHow can it spare help for kin?\n\n**Chant on Sowing Grain**\n\nFarmers sow grain in season,\nPlanting millet, not weeds.\nYet why, before the millet thrives,\nDo the weeds flourish first?\nIf weeds are not uprooted,\nThe millet will never ripen.\nWorse still, when both need water,\nThe weeds steal the nourishment meant for the grain.\n\n**Matching Minister Junshi’s Gift**\n\nI have never seen such clamor,\nEven in the heart of the city, it resembles distant outskirts.\nThough I lack a thousand-mile steed,\nI have found a branch to nest upon.\nThe moon rises behind cloud-wreathed mountains,\nThe wind stirs the tips of pines and bamboos.\nWhat have I truly gained?\nSurely I need not shun the world’s mockery.\n\n**Autumn Night**\n\nFloating clouds disperse,\nStars and constellations gleam across the endless sky.\nGreen moss clings to crimson fruit,\nPure fragrance rises from white lotuses.\nMy body, still cool, wears linen,\nMy ears, now quiet, hear no cicadas.\nSitting long, all movement ceases—\nThe autumn sky is utterly still.\n\n**On Revisiting My Garden in Autumn, I Take Up My Bamboo Staff and Don My Sable Robe—Both Gifts from Jingren—And, Seeing Them, Think of Him and Write This Poem**\n\nThe bamboo staff has long been my companion,\nThe sable robe, though spread anew, is still fresh.\nGradually it bears the snow of Min Mountain,\nBrushing away the dust of the capital.\nIt steadies my steps on the drunken path home,\nFits my ailing body with ease.\nThanks to these treasures from my study,\nAt times I feel as if I see my old friend again.\n\n**Clouds**\n\nThe clear sky is bluer than water—\nHow can a single cloud take flight?\nCatching the sunlight, it becomes a vermilion phoenix;\nFollowing the wind, it turns to white raiment.\nComing and going, it leaves no trace,\nHidden or revealed, it forgets all cunning.\nWho can fathom Heaven’s principle?\nIn the end, where does it belong?\n\n**Leisure**\n\nIn leisure, I observe all things—\nEverywhere, there is freedom.\nFish are hooked for their greed,\nMoths are scorched for rushing into flame.",

      "translated_text": "**The Azure Wutong and the Phoenix**\n\nThe azure wutong starves the phoenix,\nWhile white grains sate the wren.\nWho is this rope-girt youth?\nHe sings as he gathers firewood.\n\n**The Flowering Arbor’s Morning Glories**\n\nThe arbor blooms with morning glories—\nAt dawn they open, by sunrise they wither.\nThough their flowers are fair, none linger to admire.\nGazing afar, clouds cling to the peaks;\nHer makeup done, her kingfisher pins scatter.\nA gauze pouch cradles the morning dew,\nA jade parasol brushes the autumn mist.\nTheir longing is not like the sunflower’s,\nYet they fade before the hibiscus.\nFit only for a fleeting glance,\nThey waste the day in idle sleep.\n\n**Matching \"Autumn Night\"**\n\nLong I dreaded summer’s heat,\nNow I welcome autumn’s night.\nSudden rain meets towering bamboo,\nCool winds sway the evening lotus.\nHow could withered sedge crickets\nOutlast the failing willow’s cicadas?\nIf only I had a bird of the marsh,\nIts clear cry would wash me clean.\n\n**Matching \"Sable Robe and Bamboo Staff\" (Both Gifts from Fan Jingren)**\n\nThe noble man preserves all things,\nCherishing the old, not the new.\nThe staff grows from Shu’s rocky cliffs,\nThe sable runs through Yin Mountain’s dust.\nIt steadies treacherous paths,\nWarms a frail and ailing frame.\nNever set aside in motion or stillness,\nIt is as if I see the giver again.\n\n**Matching \"Clouds\"**\n\nThe sky’s canopy stretches boundless,\nA single cloud drifts alone.\nIt knows only to cling to stone,\nNot to become heaven’s raiment.\nComing, it has no intent;\nGoing, it needs no device.\nIf it cannot bring timely rain,\nWhy return to the imperial realm?\n\n**Matching \"Leisure\"**\n\nObserve all things through the self—\nTheir principles are never distant.\nHorses grow lean from too much riding,\nTortoises burn from scorching divination.\nThe parrot may speak, yet still be caged;\nThe wren eats its fill with ease.\nThe mist and waters of Yi and Luo are fine—\nWould that I could share them with fisher and woodcutter.\n\n**Matching \"The Flowering Arbor’s Morning Glories\"**\n\nLeaves clamor thick as a cock’s crow,\nFlowers bloom dense as kingfisher pins.\nDew glistens cold at dawn,\nMist veils the clear day’s haze.\nTheir blooms follow in ordered turns,\nYet open and close without sequence.\nThe master stands long in vain vigil,\nEver forsaking his morning rest.\n\n**Two Quatrains to Old Friend Wei of the Three Cities**\n\nThough aged, I am not yet feeble,\nChrysanthemums crowd my fence.\nThe weather turns crisp and fine,\nNeighbors gather in good cheer.\n\nThe scene is fair, our bodies hale,\nThe sky clear, the road dry.\nA light carriage on soft grass rides smooth,\nEverywhere, pure delight.\n\n**Autumn Day on the Stone Pavilion**\n\nFirst clear skies, I lean on the monk’s pavilion rail,\nThe world grows bleak in the eighth month.\nI test my strength on the uppermost floor,\nGazing from on high at the mortal realm.\nAutumn deepens, the weather suits me well;\nIn old age, my heart loves only leisure.\nI bid the distant mountains hold their hue—\nSuch feelings have long since faded.\n\n**Matching Li Shenyan’s \"Traveling Past Longmen\"**\n\nA thousand miles of autumn light fills my seat,\nOur friendship rejoices in smiles of welcome.\nThe chrysanthemums await the Double Ninth,\nAs if saving their bloom for your cup of wine.\n\n**Chant on Wind and Moon**\n\nCool winds are boundlessly pure,\nBright moons are boundlessly clear.\nPurity and clarity never forsake me,\nEver fostering joy.\nAll day, threefold shame;\nAll day, threefold honor.\nIf honor and shame touch me not,\nWhat cause have I for alarm?\n\n**To Minister Fu**\n\nThe world strikes at joy and sorrow,\nWho in this age can compare?\nThree reigns as prime minister,\nFour rivers as a man of leisure.\nIlluminating all things through the ages,\nHe gathers back the one true essence.\nI know not why,\nYet he treats me with such warmth.\n\n**Chant on Wielding the Brush**\n\nWhat man values is spirit,\nYet spirit, once possessed, is not pure.\nFeigning truth from falsehood remains false,\nDiligence to mask clumsiness still falls short.\nHunger sated brings sickness,\nSeeking cure from sickness brings no true peace.\nMany err in mistaking the sage,\nBut the sage never errs with the world.\n\n**Inviting Sima Junshi to Stroll the Summer Garden**\n\nThe rain has cleared, the scene is fine,\nAutumn deepens, the air not yet cold.\nMight you join me in high spirits?\nLet us linger awhile in the summer garden.\n\n**Autumn Day After Rain, Gazing Idly**\n\nWater gleams, clouds scatter, frost comes early,\nThough late in the year, the yellow blooms are fair.\nThough encircled by distant mountains on all sides,\nA single slice of autumn light grows old.\nHeaven creates all things without partiality,\nYet sages’ deeds baffle mortal understanding.\nCommon words need no boast—\nEven mediocre talent suffices.\n\n**Four Short Verses for Chen Jichang**\n\nThe eighth month is a small spring,\nSmall flowers bloom in profusion.\nEvening brings a light rain,\nLeaving the small carriage idle.\n\n**Chant on Joy**\n\nI ever delight in joy,\nJoy that harms no righteousness.\nJoy in heaven’s four seasons,\nJoy in earth’s myriad things.\nJoy in men’s fine conduct,\nJoy in one’s own joyful deeds.\nBeyond these joys,\nI joy in the faintest intoxication.\n\n**Chant Admonishing My Son**\n\nGood and evil lie in where they dwell,\nDividing petty men from gentlemen.\nTo change course harms not one’s gentlemanly nature;\nTo persist in error is to become a petty man.\nGood medicine cures when it benefits the ailment,\nWhite jade is prized only when flawless.\nTo forge a fine vessel requires cutting and polishing—\nHow can faults not be made anew?\n\n**On Hearing Shaohua Mountain’s Collapse**\n\nChange leaves no trace in an instant,\nYet moving heaven and earth is no hard task.\nIf the giant spirit but stretched its hand,\nWould Shaohua Mountain’s rise be all?\nSix villages’ folk are swallowed,\nNine springs’ boulders overturned.\nA woodcutter’s single word could be heeded—\nEven in Yao and Shun’s time, it could be done.\n\n**Chant on the Ancients**\n\nSince ancient times, even great sages\nFound matters difficult.\nHow much more for later men—\nCould they so easily attain it?\nSeeking it is endlessly hard,\nYet gaining it is effortless.\nA thousand, ten thousand hearts,\nBut only one heart is right.\n\n**Letter in Place of Writing to Old Friend Zu Longtu**\n\nThirty years of old friendship,\nMeeting now with white-haired heads.\nWe once drank on the sea’s edge,\nRoamed the Luo Society together.\nShedding the world’s storms,\nWe opened our hearts in pine and cassia autumn.\nFrom now on, our brows\nShould bear no idle sorrow.\n\n**Chant on a Cold Night**\n\nThe sky adds a layer of cold,\nI add a layer to my quilt.\nI speak no words of the past,\nNor do what is excessive.\nI blame myself strictly and thoroughly,\nDemand little of others.\nOnly the great sage\nCan stand in a place without fault.\n\n**Chant on Knowing Fortune**\n\nThe cock’s duty is to herald dawn,\nThe dog’s duty is to guard.\nBoth serve their roles,\nYet all returns to serving their lord.",

rustic gardens,\nSilk bundles meager yet bound.\nHaving plotted the great,\nThe small lies within.\n\n**Chant on the Unknowable**\n\nThe plow-ox sprouts crimson horns,\nThe aged oyster yields a luminous pearl.\nThough men may wish not to use them,\nCan mountains and rivers forsake them?\n\nAffairs are fundamentally unknowable,\nThings too are hard to constrain.\nOnce reduced to mere conjecture,\nRighteousness loses its precision.\n\n**Chant on Urgency**\n\nAt dawn’s extremity, one longs for rain;\nIn mortal illness, the heart seeks medicine.\nIn such moments for all,\nNo urging is needed to deepen resolve.\n\n**Chant on Knowing Others**\n\nObserve demeanor in times of urgency,\nReveal the liver and spleen in peril.\nDeep hearts and composed faces may deceive in peace—\nBeware of claiming easy knowledge.\n\n**Chant on Speech**\n\nA single word brings delight,\nA thousand words stir greater wrath.\nThough speech may unite,\nIt is speech that divides.\n\n**Chant on Anticipating Misfortune**\n\nAdornment nears empty vanity,\nYet empty vanity breeds deep misfortune.\nTo cure hunger, use food;\nTo relieve drought, require rain.\n\n**Chant on a Human Lifetime**\n\nA hundred million years lie ahead,\nA hundred million years stretch behind.\nBetween them, a hundred years—\nHow much can one accomplish?\n\nEven the lifespan of a tile,\nFew reach a hundred years.\nWhy not rejoice,\nForcing oneself into sorrow?\n\n**Thanks for the Gift of a Stone Zither**\n\nWho took Heaven’s Pillar Peak,\nAnd with a swift blade cleaved it in half?\nWhere springs once trickled, faint traces remain,\nWhere clouds embraced, their hue still lingers.\n\nNeither the gates of power could move it,\nNor the halls of wealth turn it away.\nWhat am I then,\nTo be offered as tribute to the Lord of the Underworld?\n\n**Matching the Poem on First Snow, Tenth Month Twenty-Fourth Day, Presented to the Prime Minister and Elder**\n\nOn *renzi*, snow first

takes flight.\nWine leaves me half-drunk, the curtain half-raised—\nLet not this feeling be known to outsiders.\n\n**A World of Jade**\n\nAll before my eyes is jade,\nThe poor household thus grows rich.\nPermitted to admire, not to sell,\nFitting for sorrow, not for ease.\n\nAfter fine brew induces warmth,\nLayered robes sustain the heat.\nWould I dare, in this mortal realm,\nTo weigh gain and loss by the slightest measure?\n\n**Responding to Minister Fu Han’s New Year’s Four Quatrains, Xining Sixth Year**\n\nFour poems for the New Year,\nCelebrating seventy years.\nConsider the precedents

tome of scripture, stern, astonishes ghosts and spirits.\n\nOne stick of incense, pure, uplifts the cosmos,\nOne cup of wine, fine, immerses in heaven’s truth.\nRejoicing in this great peace—how much more?\nOnly wishing the lord’s life span ten thousand springs.\n\n**A Volume of Poetry in the Abode of Peace and Joy**\n\nA volume of poetry in the Abode of Peace and Joy,\nSinging to myself, chanting to myself, I find contentment.\nRefining water and stone in idle endeavor,\nDiscerning wind and blossoms in quiet authority.\n\nThoughts take flight, suddenly mounting a thousand-mile steed,\nInspiration arises, first ascending the nine-tiered heavens.\nWhen the mood strikes, altering a word or two,\nDrunk, I chant five or seven verses.\n\nNow fearing my heart communes with the

be depicted,\nAll bones free of illness cannot be purged.\nEntrusted with themes, I am aided by spirits,\nMy lines, mistakenly, are spread by others.\n\nWould I yield to noble houses’ constant music,\nOr feel shame before wealthy chambers’ excess wealth?\nIf tallying such faults, how boundless they would be—\nWhy then do censors alone remain silent?\n\n**A Tome in the Abode of Peace and Joy**\n\nA tome in the Abode of Peace and Joy,\nTitled *The August Ultimate*—what does it intend?\n*Spring and Autumn*, rites and music, can they be abandoned?\nFather and son, lord and minister—can they be abolished?\n\nVast, the era after Fuxi and Xuanyuan’s creation,\nMajestic, the harmony of Yao and Shun’s beginning.\nFiery, Tang and Wu beyond war,\nTurbulent, Huan and Wen beyond swords and bows.\n\nSun, moon, and stars shine brightly,\nKings, emperors, and lords’ voices resound grandly.\nThousands of rulers emerge with regulations,\nHundreds of millions of years form models.\n\nLong governance breeds fear of overbearing power,\nDeep troubles still call for the expulsion of evil.\nTalents fit to command an age arise in their time,\nWisdom to aid the age is never absent.\n\nThe past is all subject to idle commentary,\nThe future must await another’s support.\nWho is the master of creation,\nTo birth so many extraordinary men?\n\n**A Stick of Incense in the Abode of Peace and Joy**\n\nA stick of incense in the Abode of Peace and Joy,\nBurned at dawn with no ordinary intent.\nDisasters like these spare men from flattery,\nFortunes sought would outmeasure heaven.\n\nUnlike the black and yellow robes beseeching temple statues,\nNor like children and girls perfuming their garments.\n*Sincerity* arises—why trouble with prayer?\n*Unwarranted* calamity—hard to dispel.\n\nThe

Who twists the willow’s crown?\nBy pond and pavilion, love knows no end,\nYet how to match the thriving grass and tree?\nRaise the cups to share the heart’s intent,\nBut guard against wind and rain that mar serenity.\nAmid a thousand reds and myriad greens,\nIs there another idle soul like me?\n\n**VII**\nOld age meets spring—do not disdain its stay,\nLest spring, in stinginess, bring worldly strife.\nOf four seasons, only spring is fair,\nIn all the year, scarce ten days free from care.\nNo need to beg the moon for wine’s delight,\nBut spare the flowers from rain’s cruel blight.\nYet when a thousand petals drift away,\nHow much gold could buy such joy as this?\n\n**VIII**\nOld age meets spring—do not tire of its return,\nFor how many springs remain to see?\nPress the winecup, urge the guest to stay,\nLest laughing branches mock my folly.\nThe world’s ways cannot bear the new or old,\nThings’ truths are hard to tell from falsehood’s guise.\nWho says the phoenix and simurgh speak too much?\nThis grievance runs too deep for words to rise.\n\n**IX**\nOld age meets spring—my zest is not yet spent,\nI beg kind Spring to linger, to relent.\nIf good deeds fear the flowers’ fading hue,\nThen with deep feeling, hold the candle high and roam.\nIn wine, the merit of a warhorse’s idle sweat,\nIn verse, the crime of quiet elegance.\nThe Lord of Spring cannot endure our jest—\nHe scolds the branches, never ceasing spite.\n\n**X**\nOld age meets spring—do not regret the wild,\nFor wildness checked, the spirit’s fire grows mild.\nThe garden, just when beauty turns too bright,\nIs struck by wind and rain, by idle spite.\nFlowers half-open—hasten to admire,\nWine just ripe—taste it first, take no delay.\nMost fine things Heaven guards with jealous care,\nNot by our whim are they bestowed this way.\n\n**XI**\nOld age meets spring—spring cannot bear my weight,\nThis burden comes from age’s slow advance.\nOne body’s decline—what is there to regret?\nBut spring’s departure fills the eyes with want.\nWhen the red sun sinks, the wind grows fierce,\nWhere fallen blooms drift, the waters run deep.\nThe wandering oriole does not grasp spring’s end,\nStill from the branches it sings its sweet refrain.\n\n**XII**\nOld age meets spring—I see through spring at last,\nNo need to grieve, no need to mourn its past.\nBody and heart have their own place of rest,\nHow can mere grass and trees beguile the wise?\nToday’s glory is tomorrow’s withered state,\nThis year’s freshness was last year’s new.\nIn this world, joy and sorrow ever chase—\nHow much wine could ever calm your mind?\n\n**XIII**\nTo Minister Sima Junshi of Chongde, Long Awaited but Not Arrived\n\nYour household swallows from the rafters last year,\nThis year past the festival, they’ve not returned.\nI beg forgiveness for delaying you so long—\nYour carriage comes at last through flowers deep.\n\nHeaven bestowed on you eight measures of talent,\nA rustic must turn back midway to meet.\nOne word from the immortal I cannot forget—\nBeyond the flowers, your carriage still unseen.\n\n**Two Parting Quatrains**\n\nBeyond the tower, flowers block the narrow way,\nHard to forget your virtue, my longing stays.\nI’d ask the peach and plum to offer thanks,\nBut peach and plum are mute—what can they say?\n\nOn the high pavilion, admiring flowers,\nI bear the guilt of breaking my word.\nIf verse could ransom fault,\nWhat time could I not keep you company?\n\n**Ascending the Stone Pavilion on a Spring Day**\n\nThroughout Luoyang, the homes of ministers and lords,\nThey plant peach and plum as livelihood.\nEach year in the second month, from on high,\nNo homes are seen—only the flowers abound.\n\n**At Sixty-Three**\n\nNow sixty-three years old,\nTeeth and hair may fade, but not my will.\nAshamed to waste my spirit in vain play,\nHow could I squander talent on reckless display?\nDread the sound of scraping bone,\nWeary of schemes that test the blade’s keen edge.\nThe sage’s words I hold in reverence:\n“To fall is simply to gain advantage.”\n*(Master Chen Xiyi once spoke these words.)*\n\n**On Reflecting on Affairs**\n\nThe ancients we do not see,\nYet we may observe their hearts.\nTheir hearts held nothing else,\nBut deep regard for righteousness.\nThe people of today we do not see in heart,\nOnly in face may we perceive.\nTheir faces hold nothing else,\nBut shallow regard for gain.\nTo regard righteousness is to benefit others,\nTo regard gain is to harm the people.\nBenefiting others or harming the people,\nIn the end, it turns back on oneself.\nIf by luck one escapes,\nThe calamity still falls upon descendants.\n\n**Occasional Writing**\n\nHeaven births the myriad things,\nEach fulfilling its own way.\nOnly humans are most wise,\nAble to encompass all.",

and wild aconite, venomous and foul;\nOwls, turtledoves, and vipers, cruel and dire.\nSuch are the people—\nFew who are not corrupt.\nVirtue seeks only peace,\nCorruption seeks only ruin.\nDay and night without cease,\nThey take their turns before us.\nHeaven covers all without partiality,\nEarth bears all without favor.\nOnly when both can nurture,\nDo we know their boundless grace.\n\n**Occasional Verse**\n\nFrogs and crickets scurry through mud,\nPhoenixes soar beyond the clouds.\nThough the distance between mud and sky is vast,\nHow can they ever know one another?\n\n**Ode to the Harmonizing Decoction**\n\nTwo flavors blend within the jar,\nA single sip brings wondrous effect.\nShared in leisure, no cause for care,\nDrunk alone—yet who does so for sorrow?\nA mere touch awakens the true master’s call,\nHalf-tipsy, one roams with Fuxi’s spirit.\nAll praise the joy of drunkenness,\nBut who would cease before the cup runs dry?\n\n**Washing the Bamboo**\n\nThrough frost and autumn, pine and cypress stand,\nYet thickets grow unchecked, their shadows dense.\nAll useless branches I strip away,\nLeaving only those that reach the sky.\nLike the echo of a dragon’s song,\nOr the phoenix’s return—work complete.\nNot for their use alone,\nBut for their noble bearing, unmatched in the world.\n\n**Ode to Heaven’s Will**\n\nHeaven’s will is nothing but nature,\nBeyond nature, no heaven remains.\nWho fears the dark when no deceit is sown?\nSeek the source to sever all greed.\nBefore the labor, words may still be spoken,\nBut at the harvest—what more is there to say?\nThe sage’s work is hard to follow,\nFor the priceless pearl lies deep in the abyss.\n\n**A Playful Letter to Brother Longtu**\n\nBrother, born in the same year,\nTwenty-seven days my elder.\nNo grudge bends my brow,\nYet joy makes us clap our hands.\nOur bond deepens day by day,\nOur shared Dao and righteousness endure.\nOnly one thing is lacking—\nA scribe to inscribe in cinnabar:\nEight hundred taels of gold.\n*(You chose me to write the epitaph for your parent’s burial.)*\n\n**Raising the Cup**\n\nI raise my cup to my sons,\nNow sixty-three years old.\nThough my station is not lofty,\nMy discourse on the Dao leaves no shame.\nWorldly glory fades,\nYet the joy of the grove still tempts me.\nIf you ask what tempts me—\nIt is this: to escape the world’s suspicion.\n\n**Facing the Flowers, Seventh Year of Xining**\n\nFlower branches gleam in the winecup,\nI raise the cup to toast the blooms.\nWine runs out, but money buys more,\nWithered flowers—no medicine revives.\nLet no man drink to excess too soon,\nNor let the flowers scatter too fast.\nDrink slowly before the blossoms,\nFor how long can spring endure?\n\n**Four Ways**\n\nThe Way of Heaven waxes and wanes,\nThe Way of Earth rises and falls.\nThe Way of Man knows rise and decline,\nThe Way of Things flourishes and fades.\nRise and decline do not share the same age,\nFlourishing and fading do not share the same time.\nYet why, when men face these,\nDo they know such joy and sorrow?\n\n**Forest Retreat**\n\nA marvel hidden in the woods,\nUnknown to the vulgar crowd.\nNow a full moon’s radiant night,\nNow a branch of blossoms unfurled.\nThe wine is not yet poured,\nThe guests must not depart.\nFortunate are we few in the world,\nTo have even this much.\n\n**Spring Overcast**\n\nDay after day, spring is overcast,\nThe gloom of spring ever deepens.\nThough I have the strength to tend the flowers,\nHow could I lack the heart to love the moon?\nOnly when the moon is full can it be seen,\nOnly when the flowers bloom can they be praised.\nYet why do flowers and moon\nShow so little mercy to man’s longing?\nFair flowers are hard to gaze upon for long,\nBright moons are hard to watch for long.\nFlowers last but five or seven days,\nThe moon is full but twelve times a year.\nEven at its fullest, it wanes,\nEven in bloom, it withers.\nWind and rain are common things,\nWhy then does the human heart not rest?\n\n**Toasting the Flowers**\n\nI raise my cup to the flower branches,\nLet the flowers understand this too:\nFlowers do not bloom for ten days,\nMan has but a hundred years.\nIn this fleeting, soul-stirring moment,\nWho would think of the haze of wine?\nWithout poetry to sever the bond,\nHow could one unravel a lifetime’s confusion?\n\n**Rising Late**\n\nHalf-remembered, half-forgotten dreams upon waking,\nSeeming sorrow, yet no sorrow—only weariness.\nWrapped in robes, lying sideways, unwilling to rise,\nBeyond the curtain, fallen petals swirl in chaos.\n\n**Reflections on Affairs**\n\nThe noble and the petty stand opposed,\nWisdom above, folly below—unshaken truth.\nWolfsbane’s roots do not entwine with orchids,\nYet why do they share this heaven and earth?\n\n**Three Delusions**\n\nTo age without rest is the first delusion,\nTo be at ease yet joyless is the second,\nTo be idle yet impure is the third.\nThese three delusions destroy the self.\n\n**Four Joys**\n\nFirst joy: long life as one’s domain,\nSecond joy: a bountiful year as one’s kingdom,\nThird joy: leisure as one’s virtue,\nFourth joy: peace and health as one’s power.\n\n**What Is It Like?**\n\nStand as a true man,\nAct not as a petty one.\nAll in life is fated from the start—\nWhy waste effort in vain calculations?\n\n**Questioning Spring**\n\nSince ancient times, flowers must be paired with orioles,\nOrioles and flowers were meant to appear together.\nWhy then do the flowers fade before the orioles arrive,\nYet still bear the name of \"oriole and flower\"?\nI would ask spring, but spring does not answer,\nWhat secret love does it hold for bees and butterflies?\nThe wandering oriole refuses to bear spring’s betrayal,\nSinging a thousand cries, then ten thousand more.\n\n**From the Tower to a Friend**\n\nA guest often scorns the spring on level ground,\nYet spring cannot but be as it is.\nNone are as content in a humble lane as I,\nYet once I ascend this tower, I think of you.\nAll I see are verdant groves and clouds,\nHalf the tiled roofs veiled in blossoms, fresh and new.\nTo lean on the railing, the heart must be free—\nWho in this world is truly free to lean?\n\n**On Loss**\n\nThe more one loses, the less one gains,\nLeaving only sighs in between.\nA man’s glory or decline is but the way of things,\nFlowers bloom and fade—why

his friends fail Yaofu.\n\n---\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Academician Zhang Zijian**\n\nEight years of reunion, yet grievance remains,\nHow can parting wine be poured again?\nThough my plain speech may seem like scattered pearls,\nI know the pure and harmonious sound of jade.\nTo live in this world, one should be a man of worth,\nTo admire flowers, one must be in Luoyang.\nI know the true men of past and present—\nThe craft of creation is no easy thing.\n\n---\n\n**Responding to the Twelve Poems Presented by Editor Huan of Gongcheng**\n\nTo capture likeness in painting is no easy match,\nThough painting may depict form, it cannot grasp the heart.\nReading your ten poems three times over,\nI find it surpasses revisiting my hometown once more.\nThe old capital stirs new longing,\nThe homeland appears as of old, towering and green.\nOf fame and worldly affairs, ask not—\nOnly two streams of clear tears to wipe away.\n\n---\n\n**Ode to the Joy of Things**\n\nSun, moon, and stars—heaven’s light,\nEars, eyes, mouth, nose—man’s spirit.\nKings, emperors, lords, and hegemons arise from sound,\nHeaven’s intent is not far from human feeling.\nBirds, beasts, grasses, trees—each kind differs,\nScholars, farmers, artisans, merchants—each rank forms.\nHow to ensure years of plenty and lasting peace,\nThat joy may be shared with all things in their glory?\n\n---\n\n**Ode to Welcoming Spring**\n\nSpring arrives, and I seek it through poetry,\nSpring departs, and I pursue it with wine.\nWine is drunk for spring’s coming and going,\nPoems are written for flowers’ blooming and fading.\nFlowers bloom and fade, poems are written again and again,\nSpring comes and goes, wine is poured repeatedly.\nMy feelings run deep, not for the young in years—\nHow can one bear the surging harmony within?\n\n---\n\n**Ode to Late Spring**\n\nSentimental Pan Yu envies the willow catkins,\nDrifting in and out of a thousand, ten thousand homes.\nYouthful vigor and ambition are all lost,\nOld age knows nothing of new affairs.\nMy poems may have faults, but others forgive,\nWhile my wine’s merits I alone proclaim.\nYet one lingering sorrow remains—\nMost of my old friends are now beyond the horizon.\n\n---\n\n**Two Poems Matching Rhymes with Minister Wang Zhongmei on His Retirement**\n\n**I**\nSeventy years in this world awaited,\nLike Master Zhang, I compose my return to the fields.\nTo know the times and act accordingly is wisdom indeed,\nWho would say nurturing one’s will is not right?\nMoreover, there is joy in forests and streams,\nNo longer bound by official duties.\nRecently, I drove my little cart to call,\nOnly to find you napping on a spring afternoon.\n\n**II**\nSince ancient times, talent soars when inspired,\nWhy does my lord alone know the times?\nA lifetime of aspirations never bent,\nIn this flourishing age, hanging up your cap is fitting.\nWillows sway gently in the breeze,\nFlowers, pressed by spring, smile as the sun lingers.\nThe clamor of attendants shakes the earth as they pass,\nYet no one asks who it is.\n\n---\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Attendant Wang of Beijing on His Visit and Gift of Poems**\n\nYour carriage came from Beijing to admire spring,\nGeng Jun’s heart had already raced ahead.\nNow frost falls heavily—what can be done?\nThis year’s flowers bloom in vain, all sound.\nYou honor me with fine verses and a visiting card,\nSurely there are no clumsy lines to convey my name.\nHeaven’s talent and beauty should be cherished—\nI know you were not born in vain for this age.\n\n---\n\n**Ode to Joy**\n\nFive joys in this life,\nFive delights in dwelling in Luoyang.\nMost take them lightly as commonplace,\nYet I hold them as no small matter.\nMy talent is unremarkable,\nMy knowledge leaves no record.\nBut my heart is at peace—\nHow could I ever exhaust these?\n\n**The Five Joys:**\nFirst, to be born in the Central Kingdom,\nSecond, to be born a man,\nThird, to be born a scholar,\nFourth, to witness an era of great peace,\nFifth, to hear of the Dao and righteousness.\n\n**The Five Delights:**\nFirst, many good people,\nSecond, many fine deeds,\nThird, many beautiful things,\nFourth, many lovely scenes,\nFifth, many grand principles.\n\n---\n\n**Ode to Joyousness**\n\nJoyous, ever joyous,\nJoy and delight, ever more joy.\nNoble men are my friends,\nFine scenes are mine to behold.\nFine wine is mine to drink,\nFine food is mine to savor.\nThis body, born and grown old,\nLives entirely in an age of peace.\n\n---\n\n**Ode to the Heavenly Dao**\n\nThe Heavenly Dao is not hard to know,\nHuman nature is not easy to fathom.\nThough one hears words,\nOne must also observe deeds.\nLeaning on the desk—great effort,\nWielding the halberd—base endeavor.\nThe *Spring and Autumn* relies on seizing the moment,\nA little cart is all one needs.\n\n---\n\n**Ode to a Single Chamber**\n\nA single chamber can hold a life,\nAll four seasons bring eternal spring.\nNever lacking fine wine,\nNever without worthy guests.\nWithin the grotto, the flower admirer is Junshi—\nHis dwelling has a grotto.\nAt the edge of the sky, the moon-floating man is Junzhi—\nHis dwelling has a tower.\nWhen we meet, there should be words,\nLaughing at my excessive caution.\n\n---\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Junshi, Minister of the Eastern Capital, on His Solitary Stroll by the Luo River**\n\nCaps and carriages crowd the nine thoroughfares,\nVoices clamor and jostle for precedence.\nOnly you take none of this as a matter,\nAt last, I believe there are true men in this world.\nThe wind turns, the river’s voice grows faint,\nThe setting sun, pale, is veiled by clouds.\nA pair of white egrets appears beyond the mist,\nAbout to land on the sand, they take flight again.\n\n---\n\n**A Solitary Stroll by Tianjin Bridge After Rain**\n\nLuoyang’s palaces are veiled in clear mist,\nSince Tang and Han, their histories are recorded.\nHow many rises and falls have vanished—\nOnly the old mountains and rivers remain on all sides.\n\n---\n\n**Spring’s Colors**\n\nLast year, spring departed and would not stay,\nThis year, where has spring’s color come from?\nLuoyang is everywhere a Peach Blossom Spring,\nMy little cart slowly turns toward East Street.\n\n---\n\n**Ode to Great Peace**\n\nIn days of great peace under heaven,\nIn times of ease for all people,\nWhen flowers bloom in profusion,\nHow can one keep from smiling?\n\n---\n\n**Four Poems Left at the Foot of Jinping Mountain During the Cold Food Festival**\n\n**I**\nThe riverbank teems with peach and plum blossoms,\nI cannot bear to see them ravaged by the wind.\nHow can I let this spring slip away?\nI linger on the heights, reluctant to leave.\n\n**II**\nCold Food Festival’s wind and mist at Jinping’s foot,\nFrom on high, I raise my cup—what joy!\nThe riverbank’s peach and plum blossoms are radiant,\nI cannot bear to see them shattered by the wind.\n\n**III**\nBoundless peach and plum blossoms await Qingming,\nOnly after a year do they fully bloom.\nDo they not recall the Creator’s labor?\nWhy does the wild wind cruelly torment them?\n\n**IV**\nHalf of spring’s flowers bloom in a hundred thousand ways,\nLately, the east wind has cruelly ravaged them.\nPitiful are the peach and plum, so gentle in nature—\nBlown away,

footsteps—\nHas the cave’s transcendent one not yet returned?\n\n---\n\n**Before the Eastern Pavilion, a single peony blooms in unmatched glory,**\nTwenty-four branches, each a beauty knitting her brows.\nOf all the world’s spring, Luoyang claims ten parts—\nYet the Shao family alone holds seven or eight.\n\n**A single peony blooms in wondrous rarity,**\nTwenty-four branches encircled by graceful maidens.\nNone in Luoyang City know this marvel—\nThe Shao family alone claims the season’s finest hour.\n\n---\n\n**Flower Season Hindered by Rain, Unable to Go Out**\n\nIn Luoyang, spring reaches its midpoint in the third month,\nSwing ropes still hang, catkins drift on the breeze.\nMy small carriage stays idle in the mud of spring,\nAmid scattered petals, orioles sing in flight.\n\n---\n\n**Chanting in the Abode of Peace**\n\nIn the Abode of Peace, duties are fulfilled as they ought—\nBeyond this, what more could one seek?\nI welcome all scholars under heaven,\nAnd wander every garden in Luoyang.\n\nWhat I must do, I do with utmost sincerity;\nIn observing others, I never strain to see their efforts.\nYet recalling those carefree springtime words—\nThey lift me to a hundred-foot tower.\n\n**Sima Junshi once wrote:**\n*“Only now do I know—*\n*On level ground,*\n*One cannot exhaust the sight of youthful spring.”*\n\nIn the Abode of Peace, nothing stirs—\nSave a single scroll of Fuxi’s writings.\nWhen weary, I rest my head, no need for sleep;\nAfter meals, I take my staff and wander where I will.\n\nI prepare to steep tea with dew-gathered water,\nAnd guard against mixing herbs to cultivate perch.\nWere it not for the sages who dispelled my ignorance,\nI might have become a shallow man of this world.\n\nIn the Abode of Peace, I pore over old texts,\nOld texts that record and link anew.\nThree thousand days beneath lamp and candlelight,\nTwenty years among waters and flowers.\n\nMountains and rivers have their masters, hard to claim;\nYet the wind and moon, free for all, I seize at will.\nLet none ask of my idle chanting—\nThis art is not passed down in the world.\n\nIn the Abode of Peace, I am a lord of ten thousand households,\nHow could I bear to waste these fine days and fair scenes?\nI’ve already grasped spring in its fullness—\nNow, in old age, I would let my heart roam free.\n\nWhen morning dew is heavy, flowers fill the balustrade;\nWhen warm wine floats, cups brim with drink.\nThe Sage’s affairs are but trifles—\nThey spare both effort and worry.\n\nIn the Abode of Peace, spring dreams fade,\nNo worldly dust to clutter the heart.\nA light breeze brushes past my seat;\nFaint music drifts from beyond the heavens.\n\nAs the sun shifts, I lean on my staff and sandals;\nWhere flower shadows mingle, I linger by the wine jar.\nNowhere in the world compares to my homeland—\nAnd how much finer, for my homeland teems with talent.\n\nIn the Abode of Peace, spring does not wane,\nThe mountain elder comes and goes in his small carriage.\nBy the water’s edge, green willows line the shore;\nBeyond the flowers, fragrant grass carpets the dyke.\n\nBright-eyed, I watch the scenes of the third month;\nVigorous, I’ve lived through four reigns.\nBy the Phoenix Tower, near the Heavenly Ford,\nI face the wind, tipsy, and return home.\n\nIn the Abode of Peace, the third month draws near,\nOnly in old age do I learn to cherish fragrant blossoms.\nI know this one delight is mine to claim—\nWho would leave even a single gold coin unspent?\n\nFine wine I drink until slightly drunk;\nFair flowers I admire at half their bloom.\nSuch feelings defy description—\nI fear no one in the world understands.\n\nIn the Abode of Peace, as spring wanes,\nI shut my door, too indolent to sit, few guests come.\nA gentle rain clears between the bamboo;\nEmerald birds flit above the flowers.\n\nI record the finest scenes in verse,\nAnd sustain joy with wine.\nBeyond this, all else in life—\nI turn my head and feign ignorance.\n\nIn the Abode of Peace, I am far from poor,\nFor within, there is a couch to hold me.\nConfucian winds transformed, reaching the Dao,\nHarmony fills the four seasons, ever like spring.\n\nSun and moon shine bright, the sovereign’s light;\nWords become trust, trust arises from men.\nOnly man and the sun stand close—\nBeyond this, what truth remains?\n\nIn the Abode of Peace, though unsettled,\nA brief course of medicine restores me.\nIn ordinary times, free of illness, I take no herbs—\nEven in misfortune, I await heaven’s will.\n\nWhen reason dims, I must seek discourse;\nWhen emotions reach their end, what more is there to say?\nAll other vain and idle thoughts—\nI may as well exchange them for a day’s sleep.\n\nIn the Abode of Peace, spring is about to depart,\nThough loath to compose a poem to send it off.\nThough spring ages and is hard to reclaim,\nEarly summer soon arrives to take its place.\n\nDrink wine, but do not let it lead to drunkenness;\nAdmire flowers, but take care not to let them scatter.\nIf one understands such things,\nHow could idle sorrows ever furrow the brow?\n\n**He also wrote:**\nIn the Abode of Peace, the third month draws near,\nOnly in old age do I learn to cherish fragrant blossoms.\nBeware drunkenness, lest it breed illness;\nFear the scattering of flowers, for they will soon take flight.\n\nDrink wine, but do not let it lead to drunkenness;\nAdmire flowers, but take care not to let them scatter.\nScattered flowers and drunkenness—bitter tastes,\nBringing not joy, but sorrow.\n\nBorn a man in an auspicious time,\nIn the Abode of Peace, a life of ease and wealth.\nWith grand strokes, I write poems boasting of vigor;\nWith a small cup, I savor light, pure wine.\n\nMountains and rivers, clear after rain;\nGrasses and trees, radiant in spring’s embrace.\nThe Creator’s craftsmanship, so exquisite—\nAll should be entrusted to the carefree.\n\nIn the Abode of Peace, though unbound,\nUnbound, I never stray from the Confucian path.\nLight wine I sip from a small cup;\nBold poems I write in large characters.\n\nFlowers and trees, radiant after spring rain;\nMountains and rivers, clear in late autumn’s wake.\nHow vast the meaning in idleness—\nUnashamed to be a true man in this world.\n\n---\n\n**On Eating Pears**\n\nI urge you, do not favor the golden-flowered pear,\nBut rather, love the red-fading pear.\nThough both share a hue like rouge,\nTheir tastes differ greatly.\n\nThe red-fading pear is sweet as maltose;\nThe golden-flowered pear makes you frown.\nSuch deceptions abound—\nBefore eating, you must discern them well.\n\n---\n\n**Matching Rhymes in Reply to Vice Director Wang Anzhi**\n\nPeaks rise like screens on all sides,\nHow can I bear to see them piled with drifting clouds?\nWe’ve already shared countless flower-viewings—\nLet us now arrange a few mountain excursions.\n\nThough not yet old, autumn’s light inspires my brush;\nAt the first chill, wine fills my cup.\nA light breeze is already delightful—\nHow much finer, if it comes from the depths of water lilies and lotuses.",

Yaofu**\n\n---\n\n**Viewing Flowers on the Third Day of the Third Month, Thinking of Friends**\n\nOn the third day, viewing flowers—how lush their intent!\nThis year, just as it was in years past.\nWhere now are those who once shared the sight?\nRaising my cup, I still face the distant wind.\n\n---\n\n**Teasing Prefect Wu**\n\nIn recent years, men slight fine flowers,\nUnknowing how the Lord of Spring resents their scorn.\nHe bids their price rise a hundredfold—\nAnd buys back all the spring of Luoyang.\n\nOne plant bears twenty-four branches,\nEach branch a beauty to overthrow a city.\nYet fearing the wild wind’s chill bite,\nHe has them all inscribed in verse at their prime.\n\nAt my home grows one peony, named \"Hue-Enhancing Red,\"\nWhich blooms in twenty-four branches.\n\n---\n\n**Oriole’s Song**\n\nTo rise to the high bough was ever its fate,\nThough it left the valley not long ago.\nIts tongue is but tender bamboo,\nIts robe newly woven of gold.\n\nFor the flowers, it speaks of their brilliance;\nFor the willows, it tells of their grace.\nAt dusk beyond the willows, it still trills;\nAt dawn before the flowers, it sings again.\n\nIts song swells when rain has passed;\nIts trills fade as spring departs.\nLet no traveler hear it—\nThe traveler’s path is already lost.\n\n---\n\n**On Appreciating Flowers**\n\nThose who do not truly appreciate flowers\nLove only their outward form.\nThose who do appreciate them\nLove only their inner wonder.\n\nThe form lies in their hues,\nHues men may imitate.\nThe wonder lies in their spirit,\nA spirit no man can create.\n\n---\n\n**On Drinking Wine**\n\nThose who do not drink well\nDelight only in drinking much.\nThose who do drink well\nDelight only in drinking harmoniously.\n\nTo drink much is to grow sodden;\nSodden, the body falls ill.\nTo drink harmoniously is to grow mellow;\nMellow, the face glows bright.\n\n---\n\n**On Fewer Concerns**\n\nFewer cares, fewer dreams;\nFewer words, fewer faults.\nThe curtain hangs—one knows the day is long;\nThe willows stand still—one feels the breeze is light.\n\nOne sees only flowers bloom and fade,\nHears no gossip of right or wrong.\nWhy seek a grotto abode?\nThe years will pass slowly enough.\n\n---\n\n**A Spring’s Span**\n\nA spring holds ninety days—\nHalf are lost to wind and rain.\nThe flowers are fair, yet no one sees;\nThe heart runs wild, yet cannot be restrained.\n\n---\n\n**The World’s Song**\n\nThe world is ever in tumult—\nWho in it is free of cares?\nHow fortunate am I alone,\nReclining to watch Luoyang’s spring!\n\n---\n\n**Spring Waters**\n\nSpring waters run clear into waves,\nYet waves can do nothing.\nThey cannot dye other things,\nOnly the lightest silks.\n\n---\n\n**Spring Rain**\n\nSpring rain, fine as silk threads,\nDrizzling down in gentle drops.\nHow can one downpour\nMake all things flourish so?\n\n---\n\n**What a Pity**\n\nWhat a pity—this flourishing spring,\nGone in a moment, never to be found again.\nBefore my eyes, gardens stretch without end,\nYet all I see are orioles singing, no men in sight.\n\n---\n\n**Pinning Flowers**\n\nPinning flowers, I feign youth;\nPouring wine, I pretend carelessness.\nThe flowers are fair, the wine is fine, the mood finer still—\nYet tomorrow, my illness will only deepen.\n\n---\n\n**Spring Departs**\n\nAs spring departs, do not lament its lateness;\nSummer arrives—rejoice in its newness.\nThough lingering fragrance remains,\nIt cannot compare to the shade of green.\n\n---\n\n**Matching Rhymes in Farewell to Prefect Li Junxi, Drafter of the Dragon Diagram**\n\nThe affectionate Prefect bids spring farewell,\nJust as the flowers burst into fullest bloom.\nSince ancient times, heroes have prized gratitude—\nFair blossoms, do not scatter too soon.\n\n---\n\n**Three Poems in Reply to Li Xi Chun, Agricultural Commissioner**\n\nLast year, you sent me poems from afar—\nEven then, I sighed at how few friends remained.\nNow, barely half of those survive—\nHow long can we delay our joyful gatherings?\n\nBy bamboo groves and water’s edge, the heart feels light;\nBeneath the moon, before the wind, the mood is rich.\nIn Luoyang’s gatherings, days without cares—\nIf not for our few, who else remains?\n\nThe sun and moon in my breast now brighten, now darken;\nWind and clouds beneath my brush now gather, now part.\nThough old and without achievement, I am thus—\nWhat would I do if I ever succeeded?\n\n---\n\n**On Encountering Spring in Old Age**\n\nIn old age, meeting spring—do not doubt it:\n*Commentary: When the patterns of things unfold, when human feelings are laid bare.*\nThough no form is visible,\nOnly the heart can know.\n\nIn old age, one learns to cherish the fragrant and fair.\n*Commentary: The prime of the year, the height of the three spring months.*\nThe flowers are worthy of love—\nHow much more so the finest blooms?\n\nI know this one moment of delight is fated.\n*Commentary: When all plants vie in beauty, when rare flowers stand apart.*\nThe Lord of Spring’s deep intent\nIs also to be known by men.\n\nWho would let a thousand gold pieces go to waste?\n*Commentary: When the sun hastens, when gold nears its end.*\nExtravagant hearts spend all,\nOnly then do brows unfurrow.\n\nLet fine wine be drunk to mild intoxication,\n*Commentary: When the jar’s head foams, when the cup’s surface blooms.*\nWhen guests come to call—\nEven in winter, it is called \"the time of Fuxi.\"\n\nLet the fair flowers open halfway,\n*Commentary: When the wind is light, as if smiling; when the dew is heavy, as if weeping.*\nOnly at the point of smile and tear\nDoes their rich fragrance cling to one’s robes.\n\nSuch meaning is hard to name—\n*Commentary: When yin and yang first stir, when heaven and earth are not yet divided.*\nWords cannot reach it,\nNor brush and ink depict it.\n\nI fear no one in the world understands.\n*Commentary: When wine reaches mellow drunkenness, when flowers are in fullest bloom.*\nMellow drunkenness leads to sodden stupor;\nFullest bloom leads to scattering petals.\n\n---\n\n**Matching Rhymes to Minister Xie Yanguo’s \"Returning Drunk in Wind and Rain at Night’s Depth\"**\n\nIn the Hall of the Dao, idle talk fills the hours,\nYet beyond the dust, cups and goblets do not fly in vain.\nAs I mount the small carriage, the streets are already still—\nDrunk, I return with the wind and rain in the night’s depth.\n\n---\n\n**Matching Rhymes to Minister Xie Junshi’s \"Only Flowers and Plants Mark Winter and Spring\"**\n\nAt times, I ask myself—\nAm I not a man from before Fuxi’s time?\nThe days pass, the months come, yet I do not record them—\nOnly flowers and plants mark winter and spring.\n\n---\n\n**Matching Rhymes to Minister Xie Kuang’s \"Lesser Light Now Aligns with the Stars\"**\n\nA single word in poetry, its meaning still unclear—\nThe Lesser Light now aligns with the stars.\nI, a man of leisure, have long been without proof—\nWhy open the back gate for more men of leisure?\n\n---\n\n**Matching Rhymes to Vice Director An Zhi’s \"Only Now Knowing Peace Is the Ladder to the Dao\"**\n\nMy dwelling’s name is \"Peace and Joy\"—how fitting the laughter!\nYet arm pain and head-wind follow one after another.\nJust when I see peace, I find peace and joy—\nOnly now knowing peace is the ladder to the Dao.",

purity?\n\n**Parting from Chancellor Xie Junshi**\nCao Zhi’s eight measures of talent now urge me on.\nSilken verses enfold me, orchid lines unfold.\nAiling limbs, a body worn—\nSweltering heat shimmers the towers.\nBetter to chant your poems,\nAnd the cool breeze will rise of itself.\n\n**Chanting in Large Script**\nPoems composed, half-drunk and mellow,\nTranscribed with a brush broad as a rafter.\nWhen the heart is full, let the hand roam free;\nWhen the spirit congeals, dip the tip once more.\nLu Yang’s sun-reversing feat was but slight,\nZong Que’s wind-riding ambition still fell short.\nTo write of peace too vast for words—\nLet the world sing its praises as it will.\n\n**Teaching My Son**\nTo master oneself is rare among thousands.\nThough one knows, speak as if one does not;\nThe difference lies in action, not inaction.\nOnly the comprehensive is called talent’s bloom,\nOnly the outstanding, a treasure at the feast.\nHow far apart are good and evil—\nSome by nature, some by diligence.\n\n**Arm Pain**\nFirst the head-wind afflicted this ailing frame,\nNow arm pain—what more can come?\nNo hindrance to the cup, only to bowing;\nThough hair goes unkempt, books remain unneglected.\nNo need to seek cures in medicine—\nLaughter and talk will dispel it all.\nAll things age and fall ill;\nWhy should man alone escape?\n\n**The World’s Ways**\nOnly by stealing leisure does one find it—\nI was born into an unhurried life.\nTime is finite, all return to age,\nBut boundless wind and moon console the face.\nBeyond my seat, only water and bamboo;\nAscending heights, only clouds and mountains.\nDrunk, I sleep beneath the blossoms—\nOnly when the blossoms fade does the dream end.\n\n**Rhapsody on Untrammeled Writing**\nWho says the phoenix nests on Cinnabar Peak?\nBeneath my brush, its nine plumes appear.\nA single line, when apt, transforms like a tiger;\nA grand composition, as if by divine communion.\nA thousand patterns, like Sichuan brocade in new designs,\nTen thousand trees, their branches warmed by spring.\nThe heavenly steed leaves no trace across the eight poles—\nOnly the wind and moon, struck like chimes.\n\n**Two Poems on the Whirlwind**\n\n**I**\nHow can there be peace if men are not at peace?\nWhere hearts are level, strife cannot arise.\nI shun the schemes of chess,\nBut delight in the words of the lute.\nIn youth, my heart clung to imperial canons;\nIn age, my thoughts rest on sacrificial rites.\nI know where true achievement lies—\nPines and cassia show their green in deepest winter.\n\n**II**\nPines and cassia show their green in deepest winter,\nWhile mugwort and reeds flourish in summer’s height.\nOnce time has passed, the rope cannot strike;\nBefore gain and loss, men must contend.\nIn doubt, move not;\nIn fortune, walk always.\nMen’s hearts are not so far apart—\nHow can there be peace if men are not at peace?\n\n**Two More Poems**\n\n**I**\nLately, illness has assailed this failing frame—\nWhy seek no medicine?\nBefore the pavilion, dense leaves form a canopy;\nBeneath the steps, yellow blossoms scatter like gold.\nWatching bees gather honey,\nObserving swallows build their nests—\nNot that the world lacks kindred spirits,\nBut that Yaofu plays the lute poorly.\n\n**II**\nYaofu plays the lute poorly,\nNot that the world lacks kindred spirits.\nOld age cannot do what youth does;\nYouth does not know the heart of age.\nTo nurture the spirit, sit in stillness;\nTo harmonize the mind, delight in pure chant.\nWhy seek no medicine?\nLately, illness has assailed this failing frame.\n\n**Head-Wind**\nLately, the head-wind is unbearable—\nYet talk and laughter, song remain unchecked.\nMen’s talents differ little,\nBut how much do matters truly contend?\nEyes closed, all before me is darkness;\nHeart open, beyond the heavens—nothing else.\nIf all were won by cunning and calculation,\nMany a hero would excel at scheming.\n\n**Answering a Guest**\nSpeakers always overstate—\nThe Way must be rolled up, then unfurled.\nGood things in the world are not constant;\nWhere in the world are there no extraordinary talents?\nNearing old age, I roam freely with my staff;\nWhen poems please me, I take up the brush.\nYet even joy may feel constrained—\nSo I write wild verses in bold script.\n\n**Growing Old**\nOld, without achievement, out of step with the times,\nIn middle age, nursing illness, I only chant poems.\nFollowing my thoughts, I seek release—\nHow could I stir trouble with words?\nThe world’s idle sorrows are all the same;\nWhat more can one do in this life?\nLeaning on my staff, I walk at dusk by the Tianjin Bridge—\nI tell the gulls: beware, do not fly.\n\nAt sixty-three, twenty-five years in Luoyang.\nIn the quiet woods, the city yields mountain views;\nBy the level pond, my seat overlooks river lands.\nAdmiring blossoms, I am ever vexed by cups and plates;\nLoving the moon, I am often wounded by wind and dew.\nSeeing the boundless goodness of peace—\nWhat matter if this body grows old?\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Wang Anzhi, Judicial Commissioner**\n\nOne good deed is already excellence—\nHow can it match your hundredfold cultivation?\nLong ago, your kind mother’s love detained you;\nFor years, the official path held no allure.\nYour talent ranks low, but your virtue stands alone;\nYour post differs, yet the academy honors your white hair.\nToo long has the Luoyang circle kept us apart—\nSo much joy, now to be set aside.\n\n**Understanding Things**\nOne who understands things is called perceptive;\nOne who knows the times is called wise.\nWisdom, misapplied, becomes harm;\nPerception, overdone, loses its purity.\n\n**Few Joys**\nWhy strive for fame or profit?\nWhy, sir, do you have so few joys?\nTo value oneself by the Way is right—\nTo be entangled in the unreasonable is meaningless.\nThe tale of ascending to heaven by daylight may be false,\nBut who has ever been drunk exchanging gold marten for wine?\nWho says cares weigh more than mountains?\nThey are but commonplace in this world.\n\n**Rising from Illness**\nIllness began a month ago through procrastination—\nWho knew it would linger so painfully?\nMorning and evening, food is hard to take;\nThis frail body defies description.\nYet I urge guests to raise their cups,\nAnd take up my brush to write poems.\nOnly then do I know the heart commands the qi—\nWhen the heart is glad, even deep illness dissolves.\n\n**Half-Drunk**\nHalf-drunk, I mount the carriage,\nThe carriage rolls smoothly home.\nA light breeze greets my face,\nGreen willows brush my head.",

Carriage**\nHalf-drunk, I ride in a small carriage,\nA glory unmatched in this world.\nA gentle breeze brushes my face,\nWeeping willows lightly graze my head.\n\nIf the mind embraces three affairs,\nAnd the heart commands ten thousand troops—\nSuch idle wealth and honor,\nI wager none would contest.\n\n**Gazing in the Mirror**\nAt dawn, I gaze in the mirror and see a hoary head,\nDelighted to find myself suddenly an immortal old man.\nBoldly, I dare to speak for all under heaven,\nClearly voicing the lofty Dao of this world.\nThough the world itself is fundamentally without trouble,\nStill, the world ever abounds with worthies.\nI ask myself: what use is this body?\nThis body is fit only for old forests and springs.\n\n**On Human Malice**\nA human life spans a hundred years,\nYet how many hardships lie within?\nNow at sixty-three,\nI have passed more than half.\nThough my bones grow gaunt, it is no sign of purity;\nThough my hair turns white, it is no measure of years.\nEven if I were to transform now, it would not be untimely—\nHow much more so when I remain roughly hale and hearty.\n\n**On Old Age**\nMy body ages in an era of peace,\nMy body is idle, my heart even more so.\nNeither noble nor base,\nNeither hungry nor cold.\nWhen guests arrive, I must pour wine;\nNo day passes without a smile.\nThe first and smoothest path—\nWho will accompany me on my way?\n\n**On the Ancient Zither**\nLong have I kept books and chess by my side,\nAnd though poor, I have long treasured this too.\nIts pegs carved from green jade,\nIts markers inlaid with gold.\nOften pawned to entertain guests,\nRarely played to seek understanding.\nLately, my servants are wicked—\nI must guard against the day they boil the crane.\n\n**Seeking Trust**\nAt first, I sought others’ trust,\nSome knew, some did not.\nThen I sought to trust myself,\nAnd many came to know me.\nNow I seek no trust at all—\nWho would still raise doubts?\nWith nothing that must be, nothing that must not,\nWherever I go, all is harmony.\n\n**On Scorpions and Snakes**\nSnake venom strikes from afar,\nScorpion venom brings death near.\nThough snake and scorpion differ,\nTheir venom is no different.\nThe snake strikes with its head,\nThe scorpion wields its tail.\nAlas, in this world between heaven and earth,\nOne fears both head and tail.\n\n**On Freedom**\nThe heart is but an inch wide,\nYet why do the two hands cling so?\nThe body spans but a few feet,\nYet why do the two feet tread so narrowly?\nWho does not drink wine?\nWho does not read books?\nAlas, in this world between heaven and earth,\nOnly Yaofu is truly free.\n\n**On Peace of Mind**\nWhen the heart is at peace, the body is at ease;\nWhen the body is at ease, the room feels spacious.\nWhen both heart and body are at peace,\nWhat matter can disturb them?\nWho says the body is small?\nIts peace is like Mount Tai.\nWho says the room is small?\nIts spaciousness is like heaven and earth.\n\n**On Poetry**\nWhy is it called poetry?\nPoetry is the expression of one’s aspirations.\nOnce words form a composition,\nThey convey the matters of the heart.\nNot only must the words be refined,\nBut the intent must be refined as well.\nRefining words yields marvelous lines;\nRefining intent yields lingering flavor.\n\n**On Doing Good**\nWhen one does good deeds,\nGood deeds are right to perform.\nEven metal and stone can be moved—\nHow could one deceive ghosts and spirits?\nAct in accord with fate and virtue,\nSpeak from the depths of the liver and spleen.\nAsk not of what lies beyond the self—\nWhether others know or not.\n\n**On the Moment**\nWhen trouble comes again and again,\nHow can one act with true spontaneity?\nEmbrace the new with resolve,\nFollow the good without delay.\nEven thieves have their own Dao,\nYet some men lack humaneness.\nVirtue has no fixed form—\nWhere one dwells in peace, there lies the path.\n\n**Chance Reflections**\nThe sun is the essence of all images,\nMan is the spirit of all things.\nAll images and all things\nAre born of heaven.\nWords gain trust through man,\nThe moon shines by the sun.\nThrough man and through the sun,\nHow could there not be great peace?\n\n**On Sitting in Stillness**\nLife is fated from birth,\nAll things are fixed from their origin.\nWho says man is the most spiritually endowed,\nYet falls short of things’ true nature?\nSome say yin harbors ghosts,\nWhich can bring a man to death.\nIf death has its cause,\nWhat is there to seek beyond it?\nMoreover, man’s fate\nIs struck by heaven, not by others.\nIf yin ghosts possess power,\nWhat can they do against heaven alone?\n\n**On the Joy of Stillness**\nHarmonious qi is even through the four seasons—\nWhat time is not spring?\nTransforming the joy of nothingness\nInto a tangible form.\nQuietly appraising things in poetry,\nLeisurely expounding principles to the heart—\nThough there be no drums or pipes,\nThis joy is unmatched in the world.\n\n**On Being a True Man**\nTo be a true man,\nOne must complete four tasks.",

of this feeling?\nThough clouds and mist lie but a short distance away,\nWe cannot often meet.\n\n**Loyalty and Trust**\nLoyalty and trust are most sincere toward others,\nIn ordinary times, it is not that ghosts and spirits are slighted.\nWhy must they be reserved only for rivers and lakes,\nAnd practiced only when hardship strikes close?\n\n**In Reply to Zhang Chun, Secretarial Aide**\nI fear to recall the past in old age,\nAll the more when I see the sorrowful poems of my late father.\nYet there is a broken verse that brings some comfort—\nNow, whose descendants are weaker than mine?\n\n**In Reply to Master Yin Chuchu**\nA land of joy long allows men to avoid strife,\nHow else to describe a heart so pure?\nYet how dare I aspire to follow in such lofty footsteps?\nOne may scale perilous heights without need of steps.\n\n**In Reply to Wang Maozhi’s Gift of Wine and Sichuan Paper**\nWhite sheep’s jade dust is truly a fine thing,\nJust when my arm aches and my head pains me.\nWine brings half a tipsy inspiration,\nWhy call a doctor when seclusion suffices?\n\n**To the Gentlemen of the Anling County Registry**\nBeneath the brocade-screened mountains, a fine place to

far—\nIt lies entirely in the human heart.\n\n**White-Haired**\nThough the five blessings⁴ are hard to attain in full,\nThe three misfortunes⁵ have not befallen me.\nOn days of great peace, without trouble,\nI become a white-haired old man.\n\n**Heaven’s Will**\nMen can speak and thus perceive,\nHeaven’s will is wordless—do not deceive it.\nDo not say that silence means nothing happens—\nThis is hardly something the common crowd can know.\n\n**Thanking the Magistrate of Shou’an for the Deed to Shenlin Mountain**\nIn the southwest stands a towering mountain,\nIts jagged peaks encircling like Penglai.⁶\nWithin lies a place fit to dwell,\nWhere springs are sweet, trees lush, and dust does not rise.\nHow generous is the intent of you gentlemen,\nWho swiftly agreed and granted it like thunder.\nWhen the waves of Tianjin calm in the eighth month,\nI may take a raft and visit it once.\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Wang Anzhi, Junior Vice Minister, Who Teased That Anzhi Was Not Abandoning

Cart**\nSince thrice I snapped the leather bindings of my books,\nTwelve years have passed without reading.\nThe long days dissolve in the great *□* son’s chamber,\nWhile from the small cart I gaze upon the azure sky.\nLeisurely, I become master of waters, bamboos, clouds, and mountains;\nQuietly, I gain sway over wind, flowers, snow, and moon.\nIn the space between bowing and rising, all is joy—\nLet others say I resemble an immortal.\n\n**Evening Stroll Chant**\nAn evening stroll on Shangyang Dyke,\nStaff of *qiong* bamboo in hand.\nSilently following the fragrant grasses,\nLeisurely chasing the wild clouds home.\nThe moon emerges above the pine tips,\nThe wind arrives at the duckweed’s edge.\nSuch scenes within the grove—\nHow many truly know them?\n\n**Plucking Flowers Chant**\nThings exist for the myriad people,\nHumans are the spirits of all things.\nHumans cannot live without things,\nThings flourish only through humans.\nMale and female are born of Heaven,\nHusband and wife are made by humans.\nBeyond Heaven and humans,\nAll else is but empty name.\n\n**In Reply to Gentleman Ren Kaishu and His Brother’s Visit**\nBamboo shadows flicker as the game of chess ends,\nIdle thoughts drift to the Nest of Peace.\nLong unseen in these quiet times,\nYet fortune brings you riding side by side.\nYour favor cannot be matched by gold,\nNor your praise surpassed by embroidered robes.\nEver fond of poetry,\nYou’ve led me into this enchantment.\n\n**Minor Spring Days**\nThe eighth month, a minor springtime,\nLike a man in his vigorous youth.\nTo eke out life is indeed meaningful,\nYet to reverse aging remains beyond reach.\nIf one possesses the arts of immortals,\nEven grasses and trees may bloom anew.\nWho knows if in days of great peace,\nThe world may resemble Yao’s reign?\n\n**Deep Autumn Chant**\nAll year round, no affairs trouble me,\nFlowers bloom in all four seasons.\nThe small cart carries me forth in high spirits,\nWherever I arrive feels like home.\n\n**Mid-Autumn Chant**\nMid-autumn’s light is fine,\nAll the more so with the moon full and round.\nMost people cherish such moments,\nYet how can one bear solitude?\nClear skies and good company,\nFine wine and a body at ease—\nIf any of these four are lacking,\nThis joy cannot be complete.\n\n**Chant While Strolling by the Moonlit Pond with Gentleman Cheng and His Son**\nGrass soft, sand smooth, wind gently flowing,\nClouds light, sun pale, willows gently swaying.\nWild words unremembered—what was said?\nDeep drinking never matched this cup.\nThe scene is fine, so we wander at leisure,\nFriends’ joy—how could we not open our hearts?\nWe vow to savor such delightful moments,\nYet fear such delights may not soon return.\n\n**Autumn Gazing Chant**\nGrass color blends with cloud color,\nMountain light meets water light.\nA towering pavilion, a hundred feet high,\nA few lines of wild geese in flight.\n\n**Leisure Chant**\nIn spring, I admire Luoyang’s flowers;\nIn autumn, I play beneath Tianjin’s moon.\nIn summer, I don the winds of Song Mountain;\nIn winter, I delight in Longshan’s snow.\n\n**On Viewing Master Chen Xiyi’s Portrait and Calligraphy**\nNever seen Xiyi’s true form,\nNever seen Xiyi’s traces;\nOnly heard Xiyi’s name,\nYet Xiyi’s heart remains unknown.\nUntil I saw Xiyi’s traces,\nAnd then beheld Xiyi’s true form.\nOnly then did I know that through past and present,\nThe world has always had such men.\nXiyi’s true form is worth beholding,\nXiyi’s ink may be passed down.\nXiyi’s heart—a single piece—\nCannot be spoken, yet cannot be unspoken.\n\n**In Reply to Junshi, Minister Duanming, on His Visit to the Divine Forest of Du’an**\nI have claimed a secluded mountain for my dwelling,\nFar removed from the dust of profit and fame.\nThe four seasons determine my wanderings,\nUnmoved even by summons to come and go.\n\n**Apricot Blossoms Fragrance**\nA guest speaks of affairs in some prefecture,\nSchemes endless, boundless.\nI, startled, remain silent—\nOnly greedy to inhale the apricot’s fragrance.\n\n**Evening Stroll at Tianjin**\nThe *zhi*-canopied carriages long since sparse,\nEvening clouds stretch empty to the north.\nThis thousand-year-old imperial city,\nA single stretch of idle palaces and towers.\nThe imperial parks still extend,\nThe towering eaves remain jagged.\nThe bridge arches like a rainbow,\nThe dyke curves like the new moon.\nThe banks of the winding stream have deepened,\nThe Han and Tang eras have long since faded.\nA lone figure sits in the high pavilion,\nIdly witnessing the rise and fall of dynasties.\n\n**Joyful Chant**\nThe sun departs, the moon arrives,\nAn end gives way to a new beginning.\nHalf its journey in the heavens,\nHalf beneath the earth.\nIn its illumination,\nThere is no sorrow, only joy.\nWho am I?\nYet joy ceaselessly fills me.\n\n**Self-Portrait Eulogy**\nPine and cassia in conduct,\nOriole and flower in literary talent.\nThe bearing of rivers and mountains,\nThe sentiments of wind and moon.\nBorrowing your visage,\nAssuming your form.\nIn the leisure of the Nine’s remainder,\nI come and go at ease.\n(The Nine refers to the Supreme Ultimate.)\n\n**Extravagance Chant**\nExtravagance must not reach its limit,\nLuxury must not be exhausted.\nTo reach the limit is to invite disaster,\nTo exhaust it is to court calamity.\n\n**Abundance Chant**\nIn the world’s ordinary state,\nHarm outweighs benefit,\nChaos outweighs order,\nSorrow outweighs joy.\nHow can human life\nEscape this?\nHow can my life\nBe consumed by external matters?\n\n**Fear and Love Chant**\nHumans possess true nature,\nAnd all things align.\nHumans lack true nature,\nAnd all things fall into ruin.\nFailing in benevolence,\nWrong is taken for right.\nFailing in authority,\nRight is taken for wrong.\nWith benevolence and authority lost,\nWhat do fear and love know?\nUnknowing of fear and love,\nWhat use are benevolence and authority?\nUnrestrained joy and anger—\nFew avoid this fate.\nMen and women alike\nShould take heed.\n\n**Autumn Pavilion**\nLeaning on the autumn pavilion’s railing,\nThe human heart—how still it feels.\nHeaven and Earth in this year’s months,\nTang and Han in these ancient mountains and rivers.\nThe pale sun before the frost,\nThe sparse sky after the rain.\nEven the finest painter’s brush\nCannot capture this sentiment.\n\n**Floating Life Chant**\nLife floats at dawn’s edge,\nGrateful to add another year.\nMovement may bring regret,\nSeeking perfection may not bring wholeness.\nMatters of the human heart,\nWords of the nature of things.\nThough the world is vast,\nWho can say it is not so?\n\n**Beyond Strength Chant**\nTo make little seem much,\nTo make nothing seem something.\nStriving beyond one’s strength\nCannot last long.\n\n**In Gratitude to Academician Fu Qinzhi for His Visit**\nNothing is longer than Heaven,\nNothing greater than Earth.\nEven Heaven and Earth have limits,\nHow can the rest be worth calculating?\nWorldly attitudes shift in an instant,\nHuman feelings stop at this.\nEven in achieving great deeds,\nOne relies on mighty influence.\nIf fortune aligns,\nTake care not to force matters.\nThough stern as frost and snow,\nRemain unchanging as pine and cassia.\nJust as I lament our long separation,\nI rejoice in your

walls, a grove and spring now lie mine.\nSeven thousand paces of level flowing water,\nOver twenty households pooled their silver bright.\nIn Jiayou’s time, I leased a dwelling by divination’s sign;\nIn Xining’s reign, the deed was mine to claim alone.\nBeneath Phoenix Tower, a newfound idle guest,\nIn Morality Lane, an old immortal roams.\nFrom Luo’s banks, the morning breeze fills my sleeves;\nFrom Song’s peaks, the moon’s glow spills through my hall.\nBy the fence, I wear lotus and water-chestnut askew;\nIn the willows’ shade, I shake the dust from talk so light.\nThe streets stretch past bronze camels, flowers ablaze,\nThe dike joins Golden Vale, where grasses spread like silk.\nThough spring’s youth lingers, I may yet venture forth,\nThe sun rides high, yet still I lie abed.\nThe cave named \"Long Life\" should have its master true,\nThe nest called \"Peaceful Joy\"—who holds its sway?\nDare I open wide my eyes upon the world,\nTo see the heavens anew in this human fray?\nAll time I pour into the winecup’s gleam,\nAll creation I shift into verse’s frame.\nI know this patch of earth is fine indeed—\nWorthy of Yaofu’s brush, broad as a beam.\n\n---\n\n**Ten Poems on Viewing Plum Blossoms at Zhang Garden South of the City**\n*Two Poems in Response to Prefect Li Zizhen of Changshui, Matching His Rhymes*\n\nThe east wind overnight split the plum branches wide,\nButterflies and bees dance on, unaware.\nI’ve stuck them in my hair and steeped them in wine—\nLet others say I’m out of step with the times.\n\nPlucked and sniffed, then sniffed again,\nI cherish this fleeting fragrance, pure and keen.\nThanks to the host’s deep kindness,\nThough the blossoms fade, he bids me come again.\n\nCool fragrance, pale beauty—here they thrive,\nNo storm or gale has marred their prime.\nAs the sun dips low, our joy runs deep,\nYet how, once gone, a year slips by in time?\n\nWhen the red sun sinks, our passion burns brighter still,\nAs jade mountains crumble, our spirits rise.\nI choose the fullest branch to break and wear—\nNot to crown my head, but to soothe this heart of mine.\n\nAfter the plum terrace’s feast, what lingers in the mind?\nReturning, I tuck plum blossoms in my carriage small.\nPassersby on the road may well laugh and stare—\nYaofu’s romantic heart is no slight thing at all.\n\nSteeped in wine, their scent grows fiercer yet,\nPlayed on the flute, their notes ring clearer still.\nThis fragrance, this music—where they come from is fine,\nWorthy of a moment’s deep and frozen thrill.\n\nSpring comes early, plum blossoms blaze,\nThough I’ve never been one to drink, I raise my cup.\nAll day on the high terrace south of the city,\nAs if I’d journeyed once more to Jiangnan’s shores.\n\nFour kinds of plum—some yellow, some red,\nTheir hues differ, yet their fragrance is one.\nEven from afar, I must return again,\nTo watch them drift on the wind, drift on the sun.\n\nThough the Five Ridges boast many sights,\nThe Three Rivers, though few, demand another gaze.\nBy the terrace, thousands of trees stand,\nDeep in the heart of this famed garden’s maze.\nFine things in this world are ever to be prized,\nRare talents in the realm are not lightly found.\nWhen next we meet in some distant place,\nWe’ll know this gathering was rare and profound.\n\n---\n\n**In Reply to a Friend**\n\nWho says the idle man holds no sway?\nHis sway lies only in the poem’s sway.\nThe four seasons’ scenes—snow, moon, wind, and flowers—\nAll are gathered in these recent lines.\n\nWhen early spring came to Luoyang’s walls,\nI viewed the plums and chanted plum-blossom verse.\nThough the plum blooms could not be sent afar,\nI sent plum poems to convey my thoughts dispersed.\n\n---\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Junshi, Minister of Protocol, for His Gift of Wine**\n\nThe spring wind scatters snow in wild disarray,\nHow can the woods below not feel forlorn?\nThe frost’s authority is stern, hard to defy—\nA petty man’s gift is hard to repay in kind.\n\n---\n\n**For Secretary Shou’an, Who Sent a Silk Screen from Beneath Jinxia Mountain, Where My Lost Scissors Were Found**\n\nJiangxia could still mourn a fallen

Youth?**\n\nWho among the six elders yields to youth’s domain?\nAge need not shame them—they indulge their whims.\nTogether in stillness, they watch things move,\nIn leisure, they observe others’ haste.\nThe heart of heaven, the full moon, the toad stirs,\nOn the water’s surface, the breeze, the lotus fragrance.\nWho would believe there is sorrow in this world?\nNew wine is brewed, the scene is cool.\n\n**Six Men Gather in Prosperous Times**\n\nSix men gather in prosperous times—\nWhat reason have they not to let loose?\nGardens and groves cover the land, all theirs to share,\nWind and moon fill the sky, aiding their poetic toil.\nTheir writings pluck the finest blooms of Han and Tang,\nTheir elegance is steeped in the fragrance of Li and Du.\nBy the water’s edge, beneath the bamboo, in ease—\nNo worldly dust, only cool clarity.\n\n**Six Guests Roam a Land of Drunkenness**\n\nSix guests roam a land of drunkenness,\nFar from the madness of common speech.\nTogether they rejoice in long-lasting peace,\nVying in song and verse, seeking the finest lines.\nBy the moonlit pond, fruits ripen in the grove,\nIn Golden Valley’s well, the tea’s aroma rises.\nBeneath the thousand-year pine, dust is swept away,\nSleeves and lapels, though windless, feel cool.\n\n**The Rustic, Now Seventh Among the Elders**\n\nThe rustic, now seventh among the elders,\nKnows only rustic, unrefined abandon.\nEach day he arranges his verses with care,\nEach year he hurries to seize his leisure.\nAt summer’s end, he delights in new wine’s taste,\nAt spring’s beginning, he loves the early plum’s fragrance.\nWhy must he do so?\nHe cannot bear the chill in his heart.\n\n**Singing Wildly in the Forest, Unfettered by Rhyme**\n\nSinging wildly in the forest, unshackled by

the market’s din far off,\nThe wall is opened, the window a jar—ivy and vines scent the air.\nOne thing in all the world is hard to find:\nThe cool breeze of the Luo River brushing the face.\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Vice Director Zhang Jingzhi’s Gift of Three Study Treasures**\n\nThree treasures of the study, all refined,\nYet in thanks, I fret no fine lines come.\nI wish to praise

peace.\n\n**Reed and Willow Chant Before the Peaceful Nest**\n\nBefore the Peaceful Nest, a small river bends,\nNew reeds and slender willows, green year after year.\nBefore my eyes, the light of time is good enough—\nWho says life is ever lacking?\n\n**Jar-Window Chant**\n\nA broken jar, gladly discarded,\nYet when gathered, it serves a purpose.\nWhen used, it must be fitted to the mouth,\nWhen placed, it can hold a bed.\nNo need for carved windows or grand halls,\nIt can turn back the light of sun and moon.\nLying beneath it in peace,\nOne may compare to the sages of old.\n\n**Two Sorrows of Life**\n\nLife is ever burdened by two sorrows,\nSorrow in death, sorrow in living—hard to escape.\nSome exhaust their strength chasing profit,\nOthers wear their hearts out seeking fame.\nMany fear they will grasp it too late,\nYet before old age, their hair turns white.\nWhat merit have I to stand above them?\nAmidst it all, I alone raise my arms, free of care.\n\n**Self-Portrait**\n\nIn all the world, none like me,\nIgnorant, with no great skill.\nIn years and looks, like Li Wenshuang,\nIn bearing, like He Zhizhang.\nOften sitting still, drinking tea,\nSometimes strolling, clad in

seek fullness, wait for midnight’s hour;\nFor brightness, watch until the moon stands high.\nWhere clouds part, the heart’s depth is revealed;\nSleepless, gazing, the mind grows ever keener.\nWe praise the ancients’ fine poetic lines,\nYet how can they match sharing this night across a thousand miles?\n\n**Song of the Small Cart**\nSpring warmth and autumn cool, the seasons fair,\nYears of plenty, health unbroken, times serene.\nOver grass soft as a mat, it rolls with ease,\nThrough blossoms bright as brocade, it moves at leisure.\n\n**A Dream of Home**\nIn dreams I reached my native land,\nA land unseen for twenty years.\nDimly, a new realm came in sight,\nVaguely, old mountains and rivers appeared.\nMy body lay beyond mist and clouds,\nMy home stood by the roadside.\nAwake, the vision lingered still,\nA fleeting moment—all was desolate.\n\n**Evening Stroll by the Luo River Sands**\nAn evening stroll by the Luo River sands,\nCountless stones upon the shore.\nGreen and yellow, long and short,\nLarge and small, square and round.\nThough they number beyond reckoning,\nTheir true use is hard to find.\nWhere lies the fabled *langgan* jade?\nOnly sighs remain.\n\n**Five Poems in Early Autumn, Harmonizing with Li Wenshi**\n\n**I**\nA single rain washes the palace eaves,\nThe Three Rivers’ scene grows clear.\nForest winds carry the breath of *hao*,\nLeaves of trees send forth the sound of *shang*.\nSuddenly, lotus buds appear;\nSoon, chrysanthemums will bloom.\nIn these peaceful times, I grow old—\nHow can I repay this life of ease?\n\n**II**\nA narrow path, freshly rinsed by rain,\nA secluded courtyard, thick with moss.\nBefore the wind, a mind at leisure,\nBeneath the steps, quiet pacing.\nI do not resign to aging bones,\nNor yield to the press of fleeting years.\nFrom time to time, I rest on fragrant grass,\nGrateful for wine to share with friends.\n\n**III**\nThe autumn of Wang Jin has arrived,\nThe scorching sun’s glow begins to fade.\nCan one nurture the *zhi* like Mengzi?\nIn quiet dwelling, will I yield to Pan?\nBetween bamboo, wind rustles leaf by leaf,\nThrough pine crevices, the moon glows round.\nThe Luo She abounds with worthy friends—\nWith each, joy may be shared.\n\n**IV**\nBy the pool, trailing willows sway,\nBy the rail, late flowers smile.\nFaded lotus droops its tattered canopy,\nAncient cypress reveals its gnarled branches.\nAs the year wanes, I marvel at time’s ways,\nIn old age, I cherish the splendor of things.\nThe winds of Dongling have not ceased—\nI recall the melons of my homeland.\n\n**V**\nThe sun’s rays fade in thinning clouds,\nThe treetops’ leaves turn slowly gold.\nHow can one bear the changing hues?\nThrough to the end, frost will encroach.\nWine no longer brings intoxication,\nThe wind easily brings chill.\nIn old age, what does one desire?\nOnly peace and well-being, nothing more.\n\n**What Does Yaofu Possess?**\nWhat does Yaofu possess?\nA single hue, in harmony with Heaven.\nIn summer, he dwells in the Cave of Longevity,\nIn winter, resides in the Nest of Peace.\nOrioles and blossoms offer carefree delight,\nWind and moonlight aid his recitations.\nI surmise that among human joys,\nNone surpass my own abundance.\n\n**Longing for the Days When I First Learned to Speak**\nLong have I recalled those fleeting words,\nWhen at dawn I played before my parents.\nJust learning to walk, I knelt at their knees;\nNow aged, my temples are streaked with silver.\nOnce, at four or five years old,\nNow, sixty years have passed.\nYet I still delight in my children’s play—\nJoy and tears mingle together.\n\n**In Reply to a Friend**\nWhat is called a good place to dwell?\nNot in strength or literary skill.\nTo act or rest lies within oneself,\nRight or wrong is struck by others.\nCounting the gains of sages past,\nSurveying worldly affairs, truth is required.\nFortune and misfortune, regret and shame arise from action,\nResolute, steadfast, and reticent—these approach *ren*.\nChange places, and all remains the same—why quarrel?\nSilent yet trusted, no need for lengthy explanation.\nThough dwelling among barbarians, one may still walk the Way,\nNo fear in one’s village, though bonds may not be close.\n\n**Sitting Alone, Reciting**\nHeaven’s decree is clear and insistent,\nYet many refuse to heed.\nThe four seasons each have their scenes,\nThe myriad things all bear feeling.\nFortune and misfortune are matters before our eyes,\nRight and wrong are names left behind.\nWho would waste their *qi* on idle strife,\nVainly contending with the world?\n\n**Again**\nHeaven’s intent is plain to see,\nYet many refuse to follow.\nOrioles and blossoms, spring’s sudden warmth,\nWind and moonlight, rain’s first clearing.\nSitting in stillness, thoughts grow clear,\nReciting at leisure, the heart finds joy.\nWho would waste their *qi* on idle strife,\nVainly contending with the world?\n\n**Thoughts Not Yet Arisen in the Heart**\nThoughts not yet arisen in the heart,\nWords not yet spoken from the mouth.\nNo spirit may peer within,\nNo person may find fault.\nThe noble one values vigilance in solitude,\nAbove, unashamed before the rafters’ hidden gaze.\nBoth gods and men reside in my heart—\nThe mouth must follow in their wake.\n\n**Reciting in Self-Delight**\nWithin the city of Jiaoru,\nBeneath the Phoenix Tower;\nIn courtyards of wind and moonlight,\nOn terraces of orioles and blossoms.\nTimes of harmony, years of plenty,\nStrolling in leisure, sitting in stillness;\nFriends well, body at ease,\nRefined recitations, elegant discourse.\n\n**Song of the Old Man**\nA hoary old man,\nWeary of all things.\nOld objects, half-forgotten,\nOld friends, rarely met.\nHidden flowers linger in mist,\nBroken dreams scatter with the wind.\nI only wish for the world—\nTimes of peace, years of plenty.\n\n**Song of the Iron Ruyi**\nThis object is wrought of iron,\nNever held in vain.\nEver beside the great *□* master,\nForever with the small cart’s child.\nStriking, it shatters coral,\nTapping, it chips teeth.\nWho would learn from such a lot?\nOnly to enter the lash’s reach.\n\n**Reciting on Daoist Robes**\nDaoist ritual employs this robe and kerchief,\nBowing only to stars, not to men.\nWhy must Yaofu bow?\nHow can one know men are not stars?\n\nDaoist ritual employs this kerchief and robe,\nBeyond the master, whom else would I bow to?\nWhy must Yaofu bow?\nHow can one know men are not my teachers?\n\nIn the attire of a Daoist—loose robes, dust whisk, and cap—\nCasual visits among neighbors are the norm.\nI hear that grotto heavens are much the same—\nMy homeland is no different from the immortals’ realm.\n\nIf the Dao resides only in the heart,\nThe work of creation may be sought within.\nIf one claims robes and kerchiefs make the Dao,\nHow dare Yaofu don such garments?\n\n**Reciting on Four Matters**\nEyes, only when the time is right, then see;\nEars, only when the time is right, then hear;\nMouth, only when the time is right, then speak;\nBody, only when the time is right, then act.\nAhead, no rich emoluments,\nBehind, no mighty armies.\nOnly where *yi* resides—\nWhat care for profit or fame?\n\n**Reciting on a Chance Thought**\nIn my prime, I toiled and raced,\nAccepting office as my lot.\nWhat I gained was but a pittance,\nWhat I lost was beyond measure.\nToday passes like a

and others rejoice;\nA high official bows, and others feel shame.\nOfficial rank comes from without—\nWhy should the heart be thus?\n\nTalent high yet fate meager,\nShame to dwell beneath others.\nIf not steadfast in poverty,\nOne does not know the Dao.\n\nThe virtuous and powerful,\nWherever they dwell,\nAre like orchids and irises,\nInspiring love and admiration.\nThe wicked and cruel,\nWherever they dwell,\nAre like tigers and wolves,\nInspiring fear and dread.\n\nA wife too strong brings misfortune to her husband,\nA servant too strong brings misfortune to his master,\nA minister too strong brings misfortune to his lord.\nA tail larger than the body,\nIce harder than frost—\nIf not discerned early,\nThe state falls, the family perishes.\n\n**In Gratitude for the Gift of a Golden Sparrow Inkstone from Advisor Wáng Shèngzhī**\n\nI have often heard of the Bronze Sparrow,\nBut never of the Golden Sparrow.\nAt first, I felt shame before the recluses,\nFor my knowledge of things was not vast.\nFrom whence does the Golden Sparrow emerge?\nIt must come from the sacred peaks.\nSevering the roots of white clouds,\nSplitting the corners of green cliffs.\nOnce carved into a mighty inkstone,\nIt ascends to the imperial archives.\nWater stored within reveals its warmth and luster,\nInk applied shows its depth and flow.\nBy the window, I delight as its mirror-like surface gleams;\nBefore my desk, I marvel as the moon seems to descend.\nSuch a generous gift—how can I repay?\nI must offer uncut jade in return.\nWhy not keep it awhile?\nFor the great transformation requires measured use.\nWhy not keep it awhile?\nFor the worthy are chosen and promoted.\nWhy not keep it awhile?\nFor the treacherous are punished and diminished.\nWhy should it not be kept?\nFor the people’s sake, to bring them peace.\nThen what am I?\nI can only receive this gift with astonishment.\nI must wield a brush as large as a rafter,\nTo avoid deep shame.\n\n**Again, Using the Warm Air

Portrait of Fàn, the Loyal and Illustrious Duke**\nFàn and Shào dwelled in Luòyáng,\nHíyí dwelled on Huà Mountain.\nChén and Shào were recluses,\nWhile the Loyal and Illustrious Duke was a prominent official.\nShào came after Fàn,\nChén came before Fàn.\nThree men bore similar appearances,\nTwo shared connected names.\n\n**Reciting on Observing Things**\nTime brings alternation,\nThings wither and flourish.\nPeople decline and prosper,\nAffairs rise and fall.\n\n**Reciting on Flowers**\nFine wine—could it not detain a guest to drink?\nBeautiful flowers still know to bloom toward people.\nToo tender-hearted to resist the flowers’ intent,\nHow can one leave the full cup before growing drunk?\n\n**Reciting on Rightness and Profit**\nIntent is not as good as rightness,\nRightness is not as good as profit.\nProfit moves people,\nMaking them forget life and death.\nProfit is not as good as rightness,\nRightness is not as good as intent.\nIntent moves people,\nMaking them stir

blossoms follow in radiant succession.\n\n**Trying the Brush**\nThe heart within the human frame is called the sun,\nAble to cast its radiance upon affairs.\nHow is it that the bright sun illumines all eight directions,\nYet seems confined to the lofty terrace of the mind?\nAt home, peace and well-being—poverty is no harm;\nWithout illness, what does thinness matter?\nIn Luòchéng, I laugh and

depart?\nOften, in quietude, time passes well,\nBut I fear idleness brings excessive thought.\nThe sun rises, and the sky is not dark;\nWhen wind comes, how can water remain still?\nIn the world, there is much level ground—\nWhy must one take the shortcut?\n\n**Asking About Seasoning the Cauldron**\nI ask you about seasoning the cauldron—\nDare I inquire into the art of its craft?\nOnly salt and plum are hard to perfect,\nBut are there not ginger and cinnamon to add spice?\nTo blend the broth, one must seek beauty,\nYet how can the many mouths all be satisfied?\nBeware of speaking lightly of the world’s affairs—\nYī and Zhōu were no ordinary men.\n\n**Reading Ancient Poetry**\nLeisurely reading the poems of the ancients,\nI ponder their intent.\nThough ancient and modern times differ,\nTheir intent remains unchanged.\nJoy and anger, sorrow and delight,\nPoverty and wealth, high and low—\nAlas, what is this thing called emotion,\nThat moves people so?\n\n**Bookworm**\nIts form resembles a fish,\nIts heart delights in gnawing books.\nIt dwells always in boxes and baskets,\nNever in rivers or lakes.\nIt causes a thousand kinds of harm,\nYet no one speaks of cooking it.\nYear after year, when summer peaks,\nIt molts and is renewed as before.\n\n**Reciting in a Lean Year**\nA lean year—my heart is not lean,\nA poor household—my Dao is not poor.\nWho knows that within heaven and earth,\nThere exists another fine universe?\n\n**Ultimate Discourse**\nBelow lies the Yellow Springs, above the heavens,\nEach person is granted a hundred years or so.\nYet knowing how many deaths are lived in vain,\nIt is as if one were never born at all.\nTo recognize a bright pearl, one must seek the vast sea;\nTo find fine jade, one must search the famous mountains.\nFirst, one must exhaust all worldly affairs,\nThen may one speak of transcending the world.\n\n**Reciting on Seeking a Mirror**\nA person without a mirror in flowing water\nShould seek a mirror in still water.\nFlowing water has no fixed form,\nStill water has a fixed essence.\nA person without a mirror in water\nShould seek a mirror in others.\nWater reflects a person’s appearance,\nOthers reflect a person’s spirit.\n\n**Reciting on Studying Buddhism**\nFine food and rich robes are not easily endured,\nLong days and seasons—what can one do with sorrow?\nIn youth, seeking fame, I turned to Confucius;\nIn old age, fearing death, I drew near to Śākyamuni.\nFutile to sever ties—ties grow heavier;\nVain to seek relief from illness—illness multiplies.\nThe long river, a strip of silk in the distance,\nFortunately windless—yet waves arise.\n\n**Reciting on Frost and Dew**\nHeaven and earth possess moisture,\nWhich descends in abundance.",

harmed.\nThese two arise from the selfsame qi—\nHow manifest are grace and might!\n\n**Reciting on Heaven’s Mandate**\nWhat may be entrusted is fate;\nWhat may be relied upon is Heaven.\nMan acts not rashly—\nEvents do not arise by chance.\n\n**On Nature and Disposition**\nTo cultivate form refines nature;\nTo follow traces refines disposition.\nThe worthy follow traces;\nThe sage embodies form.\n\n**Reciting on Heart and Traces**\nThe sage comprehends the heart;\nThe worthy comprehends the traces.\nComprehending the heart knows no bounds;\nComprehending the traces knows no limit.\n\n**Reciting on Observing Things**\nNo thing flourishes in twain;\nNo affair proceeds alone.\nGlory and decay arise in turn;\nWorthy and foolish advance together.\n\n**Reciting on Thought and Care**\nBefore thought and care arise,\nEven spirits and gods cannot know.\nIf not from me,\nThen from whom else?\n\n**In Reply to an Old Friend in Court**\nIn youth I cultivated literature,\nAnd once beheld the splendor of the state.\nThough I have not returned to mountain forests,\nI have never forgotten the furrowed fields.\nDoes the deer in the granary lack ambition?\nThe phoenix and wild goose follow their own way.\nKnowing affairs of today,\nGreat matters demand reflection.\n\n**Reciting on Not Venturing Out in Winter**\nWinter is not that I do not wish to go out—\nWishing to go out, I suffer the shortness of days.\nOld in years, I fear long conversations;\nIn the cold, I dread returning late.\nThe mountain elder’s head is troubled by wind;\nThe affection of village friends runs deep.\nIf you must invite me,\nSpring’s light is not far off.\n\n**Observing Things**\nEarth, through stillness, is square;\nHeaven, through motion, is round.\nHaving rectified the forms of square and round,\nOne then discerns the power of motion and stillness.\nStillness prolonged must yield moisture;\nMotion at its extreme thus ignites.\nMoisture completes the water’s body;\nIgnition fulfills fire’s function.\nWater’s body is received by vessels;\nFire’s function is transmitted by fuel.\nThe body comes after Heaven and Earth;\nThe function arises before Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Reciting on Family and State**\nDepravity and uprightness differ in heart,\nYet family and state share the same body.\nDepravity brings ruin;\nUprightness brings rise.\n\n**Reciting on Depravity and Uprightness**\nThe worthy delight in uprightness;\nThe treacherous delight in depravity.\nDelighting in depravity breeds contention;\nDelighting in uprightness fosters harmony.\n\n**Reciting on Righteousness and Profit**\nThe noble person esteems righteousness;\nThe petty person esteems profit.\nEsteeming profit brings chaos;\nEsteeming righteousness brings order.\n\n**Reciting on Heaven’s Timing**\nMan acts in affairs;\nHeaven’s mandate is timing.\nTiming, once lost, is hard to recover;\nAffairs, once gone, are difficult to pursue.\n\n**Reciting on Grace and Righteousness**\nDeep grace makes one kin;\nWeighty righteousness makes one lord.\nWhen both grace and righteousness are attained,\nOnly then is one called human.\n\n**Reciting on Leisurely Strolls**\nWhat is called a true friend?\nA true friend is not lightly found.\nWithout the ears of Music-Master Kuang,\nHow can there be the zither of Bo Ya?\nThough the mulberry and elm cast their shadows,\nHow could I forget the heart of pine and cassia?\nWalking alone on the moonlit embankment,\nEach step is met with a lofty chant.\n\n**Reciting at One’s Side**\nThe myriad transformations are complete within the body—\nOne must but nurture them deeply.\nWhy is it called a precious mirror?\nOnly because it is wrought of refined gold.\nWine, when scarce, is sipped like tea;\nPoetry, when abundant, is chanted like history.\nYan Yuan found joy within the world’s bounds—\nThe world’s affairs are hard to bear.\n\n**Reciting on Snow**\nFine wine and choice dishes with pipes and strings,\nAll night the cauldron boils in celebration of a bountiful year.\nDeep within the lord’s gates, do they know?\nA million displaced people lie beneath the open sky.\n\n**Self-Composed on the New Year of My Sixty-Fifth Year, Xining 8**\nMy home lies within Luoyang’s walls,\nMoreover by the banks of the Tianjin.\nIn my sixty-fifth year,\nAmid the Song’s flourishing dawn.\nThe southern garden borders the thoroughfare;\nThe northern garden gazes upon twin towers.\nThough dwelling in the capital,\nIt is as if I reside in a mountain stream.\nClear springs trace the channels;\nLush trees adorn the skies.\nCool winds descend through bamboo;\nBright moon appears amid pines.\nBefore me grow orchids and angelica;\nBeneath my gaze, no ice nor embers.\nAt my seat, joy abounds;\nIn my breast, no strife.\nWinter and summer, I do not venture out—\nHeat and cold change in vain.\nGlory and disgrace do not enter—\nWealth and honor parade in vain.\nI loathe hearing of others’ faults;\nI delight in speaking of others’ goodness.\nWhy hesitate to act?\nWhy take medicine when not dizzy?\nWho says gold and stone are hard?\nTheir hearts, too, can break.\nWho says spirits and gods are divine?\nTheir sincerity, too, can pierce through.\n\n**Six-Word Reciting on a Small Carriage**\nIn days past, riding a carriage was common;\nNow, seeing one ride, they rush in haste.\nSince there are warnings from carriages past,\nHow can there be no caution in treading their tracks?\nBefore setting out, one must drink tea;\nBefore ascending, one must don traveling attire.\nAt the axle’s side, hang volumes of poetry;\nBy the shaft’s end, suspend a jar of wine.\nThe wheels turn slowly to pass fragrant grasses;\nThe canopy lowers to avoid drooping willows.\nBy the water’s edge, one must proceed with care;\nAmid flowers, one must move with composure.\nAt dawn, one often traverses the path of shoes;\nAt dusk, one frequently passes the lane of peace.\nIn deep spring, one gazes upon radiant beauty;\nIn late autumn, one feasts sight on abundant harvests.\nBefore the Tower of Five Phoenixes, the moon’s glow;\nAtop the Tianjin Bridge, the cool breeze.\nIn the Golden Valley Garden, flowing waters;\nBeyond the Wei King’s Embankment, tall bamboos.\nIn stillness, time is most precious;\nIn leisure, the flavor lingers long.\nAll one passes is met with delight;\nAll one sees is free from attachment.\nOne may see farmers grasping their plows;\nOne may see silkworm maidens seeking mulberry.\nOne may see *miwu* covering the fields;\nOne may see caltrops filling the walls.\nOne may see thorns growing dense;\nOne may see orchids and angelica fragrant.\nOne may see chickens, pigs, and dogs at labor;\nOne may see eagles, ospreys, and phoenixes in flight.\nThe harmful are not seen to cause harm;\nThe good are surely not harmed.\nThe three peaks of Mount Hua stand towering;\nThe myriad acres of the Yellow Pool stretch vast.\nIf not to live as a man in vain,\nThen do not squander leisure in Luoyang.\nHaving gained much of Heaven and Earth’s essence,\nWhat harm if Old Man Yaofu departs?\n\n**Reciting on Peace and Joy**\nThe Master of Peace and Joy,\nWithout fame or surname,\nFor thirty years has dwelt\nBy the Luo in Luoyang.\nHis heart holds the wind and moon;\nHis nature, rivers and lakes.\nHe takes flight at the sight of color,\nAlighting only after soaring.\nNo lowly, no poor;\nNo rich, no noble.\nNo sending off, no welcoming;\nNo restraint, no taboo.\nNever troubled by hardship;\nNever drinking to drunkenness.\nHe gathers the world’s spring\nInto his liver and lungs.\nHis pool nurtures his chants;\nHis jar-window invites sleep.\nThe small carriage delights his heart;\nThe great brush quickens his will.\nSometimes he dons a bamboo hat;\nSometimes he wears a half-sleeve.\nSometimes he sits amid the woods;\nSometimes he walks by the water’s edge.\nHe delights in seeing good people;\nHe delights in hearing good deeds.\nHe delights in speaking good words;\nHe delights in acting with good intent.\nHearing of others’ faults,\nIt is as if he bears thorns.",

to criticize?\n\n---\n\n**Observing the *Spring and Autumn Annals***\n\nThe august royal house exists in name alone,\nWar never ceases beneath heaven.\nStates are destroyed, men are conquered—none lags behind,\nSeeking alliances, exacting vengeance—never at peace.\nThe decrees of Jin and Qi burn like fire,\nWhile the foundations of Wen and Wu chill like ice.\nOnly the sorrow for the unicorn remains a single heart,\nPreserved for ten thousand years as if in cinnabar.\n\n---\n\n**A Chant on Observing the Three Sovereigns**\n\nHow vast the cosmos—it proclaims itself through me,\nBeyond heaven and earth, what more is there to say?\nAt first, the Great Dao was no ordinary Way,\nJust as there was a time before and after heaven.\nIts methods were so subtle, no trace could be seen,\nIts achievements so enduring, the years were unknown.\nIf the world were to rank meritorious deeds,\nNone could stand before them.\n\n---\n\n**A Chant on Observing the Five Emperors**\n\nWilling to yield or advance the realm,\nWhat words could describe their grace?\nWhere their robes hung, majesty flourished,\nWhen jade and silk were offered, reverence shone.\nEvery thing followed the highest principle,\nEach person willingly achieved great deeds.\nHow did they attain this?\nOnly by their brilliance, like the sun at noon.\n\n---\n\n**A Chant on Observing the Three Kings**\n\nA vast expanse of the Central Plains—over ten thousand *li*—\nHardly a place for the weak to dwell.\nXia and Shang could still proclaim their calendars,\nYet Tang and Wu could not easily wield their weapons.\nThe Fire of Ze received its name and thus transformed,\nBut the Water of Heaven found no response—no need arose.\nThose who take benevolence and righteousness as their heart\nWould never become petty men of the world.\n\n---\n\n**A Chant on Observing the Five Hegemons**\n\nIntent on honoring their names, their names suffered more,\nAs people rushed to obey, exhausted beyond endurance.\nLives were lived amid forests of swords and spears,\nWhile justice and wealth were carried in their hearts.\nThough they could sigh for the lamb and cherish ritual,\nAlas, the phoenix never came to grace them.\nWithin the remaining years of Eastern Zhou’s Five Hegemons,\nOnly Confucius was heard to sigh.\n\n---\n\n**A Chant on Observing the Seven States**\n\nAt their end, they still schemed and maneuvered,\nDeaf to words of benevolence and righteousness.\nWho would have thought Qi could be broken yet Jimo preserved?\nOr that victory at Changping meant burying Zhao’s men alive?\nSeeing ghosts at dawn was no strange thing,\nKilling in broad daylight caused no surprise.\nThen came Su and Zhang, wielding their three-inch tongues,\nGrasping throats so none could live together.\n\n---\n\n**A Chant on Observing the Qin Dynasty**\n\nThe seven states clashed with thunderous might,\nGrinding against one another, never at rest.\nOnly when one lord’s heart was set\nDid the four seas run red with blood.\nThree thousand retainers soon became a dream,\nA hundred and two mountains and rivers turned to autumn.\nBoasting of enfeoffing marquises to guard the land—\nYet Zhao Gao was no marquis at all.\n\n---\n\n**A Chant on Observing the Two Han Dynasties**\n\nThe old battlegrounds of Qin’s broken mountains and rivers—\nWho would have thought the people would farm mulberries again?\nNine thousand *li* of land opened to enfeoffment,\nOver four hundred years bearing the title of emperor.\nAfter ruin came Wang Mang and Dong Zhuo,\nYet none remembered the efforts of Gao and Guang.\nWith such splendor of culture in those days,\nHow could the city walls ever lie in ruins again?\n\n---\n\n**A Chant on Observing the Three Kingdoms**\n\nAwe-inspiring, the tripod’s stand shook like thunder,\nYet its lofty traces are lost to time.\nDrums and flutes in one region left emotions unfulfilled,\nBows and blades across ten thousand *li* strained their strength.\nDebating war with Hengshi—was there no intent?\nWatering horses at the Yellow River—was it all in vain?\nThough one may speak of heaven’s timing, it is also human affairs—\nWho could have known that beyond foresight, fine gold would be lost?\n\n---\n\n**A Chant on Observing the Western Jin**\n\nPeace does not mean there is no worry,\nTo be at ease and forget danger is no good plan.\nRanking men’s talents relied on biting satire,\nJudging the times required a taste for elegance.\nA knife could not cut open the belly of Gonglü,\nNo wood could behead Liu Yuan.\nThe disaster lay in a single line at Evening Sun Pavilion,\nWhile at the Eastern Gate, the waves sighed endlessly.\n\n---\n\n**A Chant on Observing the Sixteen Kingdoms**\n\nBeneath the vast sky, the realm was called the imperial domain,\nWhere Great Yu once governed the aftermath of floods.\nWhen clothes wore out, lice and nits multiplied,\nWhen melons rotted, worms and maggots thrived.\nDragon robes were never meant for mad bandits,\nNor were the standards of court ever raised for rebellious Hu.\nConfucius had words worth pondering—\nIn those days, they lacked a Guan Yiwu.\n\n---\n\n**A Chant on Observing the Northern and Southern Dynasties**\n\nWhen the world was split between north and south,\nEnvoys never ceased their journeys.\nPartial hegemons still upheld ancient laws,\nA fragile peace bore traces of old stench.\nLuoyang’s refined reputation praised Cui Hao,\nThe south’s extraordinary talent admired Xie An.\nFor two hundred and forty years, they rode side by side—\nHow could one casually call them barbarians?\n\n---\n\n**A Chant on Observing the Sui Dynasty**\n\nFrom the start, the plans were flawed,\nAnd those who followed only compounded the harm.\nPeople were as insignificant as ants, coveting land,\nGold and silk as worthless as mud, pleasing concubines.\nThe campaign against Liaodong aimed for the wild frontiers,\nThe canal’s flow expressed weariness with the endless.\nThirty-six years—all swept away.\nHad it not been so, the world would not have returned to Tang.\n\n---\n\n**A Chant on Observing the Tang Dynasty**\n\nHeaven-born, divine, and martial, it settled the center,\nFor without it, the many rebels would not have been quelled.\nWithout the stern winds of the Zhenguan era,\nHow could the Kaiyuan age have known such glory?\nOnly from on high could the grandeur of mountains and rivers be seen,\nOnly in summer could the length of days and months be known.\nFor three hundred years, it unified the realm—\nThough the deeds are past, the Dao shines ever brighter.\n\n---\n\n**A Chant on Observing the Five Dynasties**\n\nSince the Tang’s fall and the collapse of imperial order,\nThe world’s people have suffered turmoil.\nThe altars of state hung on the whims of soldiers,\nThe court’s weight was decided by the clamor of regional lords.\nDeep winter’s cold trees do not shed their leaves,\nThe faint stars before dawn still hold their light.",

      "translated_text": "**A Chant on Observing the Five Dynasties (continued)**\n\nFifty-three years passed under five successive houses—\nOnly then did we know the land awaited a true king.\n\n**A Chant on Witnessing Prosperity**\n\nAmid the chaos of the Five Dynasties’ upheaval,\nSuddenly the clouds parted, and heaven reappeared.\nGrass and trees, bathed in fresh rain and dew for a hundred years,\nWheels and writs now traverse the old mountains and rivers for ten thousand *li*.\nIn ordinary lanes and alleys, officials still don their caps and sashes,\nWhile gardens and pavilions, one after another, resound with pipes and strings.\nThough the people grow old in this age of peace, spring remains young—\nOrioles and blossoms do no harm, even as the sun climbs high and men sleep on.\nWe, who cultivate simplicity, rely on this enlightened age,\nFortunate beyond measure—how could we not know?\nThe realm’s finest talents now retreat into obscurity,\nWhile in this world of fair scenes, brows unfurrow in delight.\nBorn only to know abundance,\nAged without ever enduring chaos or separation.\nFive deeds surpass all previous dynasties—\nEven under Yao, none could match them:\nFirst: On the day of revolution, the markets did not alter their stalls;\nSecond: The conquest of the realm was achieved after ascending the throne;\nThird: Not a single innocent life was taken;\nFourth: At a hundred years, only four reigns;\nFifth: A century without internal strife.\n\n**A Chant on Rejoicing in Old Age**\n\nHow long can these silken temples last?\nWhy trouble with plucking each white hair?\nThough I hold no office in this world,\nI know well the affairs of men.\nWhen spring warms and autumn cools,\nThat is my time to wander east and float west.\nHow many vast and fertile fields lie open—\nOnly now does this old mountain-dweller truly smile.\n\n**A Chant on Paying Homage to Confucius**\n\nWho, holding a scroll, does not read?\nBut how many truly grasp the nature of things?\nHis craft lies within the world’s speech,\nYet his subtlety transcends the carpenter’s line.\nRefining being and non-being—heaven’s work;\nBalancing order and chaos—the emperor’s task.\nGreat indeed is his intent in praising the *Yi* and compiling the Classics—\nSurely none among the people since his time have matched it.\n\n**Returning the Poetry Scroll of Beneficent Master Yi**\n\nMonk’s staff and alms bowl have followed me, wrapped in a single cloth,\nThat cloth once brushed the dust of ten provinces.\nHis mind, long attuned to Buddha-nature, knows no hindrance,\nHis speech, though steeped in Confucian words, remains unforced.\nThe mountains and rivers of Wu and Yue are but yesterday’s affairs,\nWhile the wind and moon of Yi and Song now belong to this body.\nStrolling or sitting idly beneath pine shadows,\nHe must rely on sharp eyes to laugh at the world.\n\n**A Chant on Heaven and Man**\n\nTo know all of human nature—how could heaven differ?\nYet not knowing is as distant as heaven from earth.\nIn youth, the qi is sharp but untried,\nUnwilling to believe the world holds hardship.\nTo know both human nature and heaven’s will—\nSpeak of them as one, and where is the division?\nTo extend one’s own heart to others’ hearts,\nWhat worry remains that the realm cannot be governed?\n\n**A Chant on Spring at Brocade Screen Mountain**\n\nBeneath Brocade Screen Mountain lies my home,\nWhere every year the festival of Cold Food arrives.\nEarly spring’s weather is already fine—\nHow much more so with a master so worthy for a hundred *li*?\nTogether we drink by the same stream,\nDrunk, we sleep beneath ten thousand blossoms.\nTomorrow, the saddle turns eastward—\nThe scenery of Shangyang will be even more radiant.\n\n**A Chant on Delighting in Spring**\n\nOf the four seasons, I love spring best,\nAnd in spring, I love the vernal equinox most.\nWarmth gently nurtures all things,\nNo chill clings to men.\nFine flowers just unfurl their buds,\nExquisite wine is light and mellow.\nA guest in this nest of peace and joy—\nHow could I not grow half-drunk?\n\n**Four Chants on Observing Things**\n\nThe sun and moon shine no differently,\nYet day and night, the moon’s form changes.\nMen and ghosts share the same emotions,\nBut life and death follow different principles.\nIf you cannot know life,\nHow can you know death?\nIf you cannot serve men,\nHow can you serve ghosts?\n\nOrioles and cicadas differ in form—\nWhy trouble yourself with vain words?\nWhen qi is abundant, strength overflows,\nWhen sound fades, it is no different from silence.\nTiming comes by one’s own effort,\nFate departs at another’s will.\nDo not grieve over heart-wrenching matters—\nGrief brings no benefit to the body.\n\nThe passions of past and present are one—\nWho finds it hard to endure?\nDiscerning affairs is no easy task,\nKnowing men is even harder.\nExcessive doubt undermines trust,\nBlind faith loosens vigilance.\nEven Yao and Shun had their flaws—\nHow could they have lacked great villains?\n\nWhat a man’s ears hear\nCannot compare to what his eyes witness.\nEars hear conflicting accounts,\nEyes see no deception.\nTo cast aside ears and eyes,\nRelying solely on the tongue’s debate—\nThis may not achieve the world’s work,\nBut only invite the world’s laughter.\n\n**A Chant on the Value of Spirit**\n\nA man’s worth lies in his spirit,\nYet spirit often lacks purity.\nTo possess spirit and purity—\nThat is the first-rank man.\nWithout purity, there is no principle;\nRight and wrong shift with anger and joy.\nIn anger, right becomes wrong;\nIn joy, wrong becomes right.\nAnger estranges the good,\nJoy aligns with the petty.\nFew are the ruined states and lost families\nNot born of this.\n\nTake a wife for her gentleness,\nMarry a husband for his talent and beauty.\nHow rare the upright woman\nWho matches a true man!\n\n**A Chant on Righteousness and Profit**\n\nNobler than hills and gardens,\nEven meager silks are prized.\nWhen righteousness comes first,\nProfit follows naturally.\nAbandon your sacred tortoise,\nTo gawk at my chewing jaws.\nHaving lost righteousness,\nWhat can profit achieve?\nTo esteem righteousness is to yield—\nThe gentleman’s Way grows.\nTo esteem profit is to contend—\nThe petty man’s Way prevails.\n\n**A Chant on the Small Carriage’s First Outing**\n\nBeyond the world lie thirty-six grotto-heavens,\nAll seemingly arrayed within Luoyang.\nOn days when spring warms and autumn cools,\nA small carriage can move but one palace a day.\n\n**Composed at the Banquet of Prefect Wang Xuanhui**\n\nThe capital’s three-time host, master of the house,\nWhose grand estate and famous gardens crown Luoyang.\nAgain, a new spring falls into his hands—\nTen thousand flowers’ fragrance illuminates the wine cups’ crimson.\nAnother spring has passed in a flurry,\nLeaving only melancholy, drowned in wine’s depth.\nAll the radiant scenes have faded from view—\nOnly before the goblet do I recall old friends.\n\n**A Chant in Late Spring, Replying to a Friend**\n\nAfter a year apart, how do you fare?\nDo not say that being neighbors leaves virtue unaccompanied.\nLuoyang’s spring has already ended in a span of inches—\nDo you still remember our past visits?\n\n**A Chant on Hearing Music at Tianjin Bridge**\n\nFamous gardens stand side by side in Luoyang’s spring,\nLanes and alleys are dust-free, silks and satins renewed.\nWhere is that green tower beyond the peach and plum?\nThe strains of music drift again to Tianjin Bridge.\n\n**A Chant on Late Spring**\n\nWillow catkins, full of intent, vainly imitate snow,\nElm pods, heartless, idly pile like coins.\nPoverty and sorrow cannot bear spring’s betrayal—\nWine-sickness lingers, little changed from last year.\n\n**Two Self-Inquiries**\n\nWhy have I been able to write poetry these past years?\nAlas, the years age, and spring returns again.\nThe wandering oriole cannot bear the flowers’ scattering,\nCrying until dusk, it still cries on.",

      "translated_text": "**Why These Years of Poetry?**\n\nWhy these years of poetry?\nPeach and plum stay silent, but the oriole has words.\nIt cries until dusk and still cries on—\nAlas, the years age, and spring returns again.\n\n**In Response to Commissioner Yu Gongda of Chengdu**\n\nTwo years ago, my carriage passed Tianjin,\nWhere we often raised our cups beneath the flowers.\nNow in this brocade city, blossoms blaze—\nYet how could I recall Luoyang’s spring?\n\n**Two Chants on Wu and Yue**\n\nIn the *yisi* year, Helü humbled Chu;\nIn the *wuchen* year, Goujian crushed Wu.\nHad they seized the moment as of old,\nThirty-four years would have passed unknown.\n\nFu Chai, in the *dingwei* year, imprisoned Yue;\nGoujian, in the *wuchen* year, destroyed Wu.\nTwenty-two years of reversal—\nJust as before, they struck at emptiness.\n\n**A Chant on Duty**\n\nThe wren finds its nest in a single branch,\nNot swayed by sweet words into careless pride.\nEven with strength, crossing the North Sea is hard—\nHow could mere might move a goose feather?\nI wish to express my gratitude clearly,\nNot to squander favor in reckless haste.\nHeaven’s blessings are many, yet fortune fades—\nSpring flowers, though lush, still wither too soon.\n\n**A Chant on Rise and Fall**\n\nSun, Chen, and Li—\nTheir downfalls were alike.\nThough they had some culture,\nWhere was their heroic spirit?\n\nCao, Liu, and Sun—\nTheir rises were alike.\nThough they had some talent,\nWhere was their world-changing destiny?\n\n**A Chant on Civil and Martial Arts**\n\nAs a man of letters,\nOne must also be prepared for war.\nThe Way of civil and martial arts—\nBoth are my family’s affairs.\n\n**A Chant on Good and Evil**\n\nGun had a son,\nWhile Yao and Shun had none.\nWhy do blessings and calamities follow thus?\n\nYao and Shun had no heirs,\nWhile Gun had descendants.\nWhy do fortune favor virtue and disaster strike excess?\n\n**A Chant on Self-Examination**\n\nNot being a perfect man,\nI do not demand perfection in others.\nBut if I were a perfect man,\nI would demand perfection in myself.\n\n**A Chant on Well-Being**\n\nHealth without illness,\nFortune without disaster—\nEven if the whole world enjoyed them,\nThey would not be enough.\n\n**A Chant on Four Things**\n\nWealth, beauty, fame, and power—\nThe world clings to these.\nOnly when unmoved by the four\nCan one truly see others.\n\n**A Chant on Gratitude and Resentment**\n\nIn human nature,\nNothing weighs heavier than death.\nGratitude stirs the heart—\nEven in death, there is joy.\nResentment binds the heart—\nEven in death, it does not end.\nSo deep are gratitude and resentment,\nThey shape a person thus.\n\n**Two Chants on Qin Chuan**\n\nBack then, I rode through Qin Chuan,\nAnd in a flash, twenty years have passed.\nHearing you speak of home,\nI vaguely recall its old mist and haze.\n\nQin Chuan, land of Han emperors,\nNow the eastern passes hold the capital.\nHow many sages and worthies fill the old histories—\nYet in the setting sun, only desolation remains.\n\n**In Response to Prefect Wang Zhongxian of Jiang**\n\nAs a gentleman of Jiang, you bear the bronze tiger tally,\nAnd your poems are no empty boast.\nThe land still bears the grasses and trees of Tang,\nThe mountains and rivers still stir the clouds and mist of Jin.\nYour gardens and ponds overflow with verse,\nThe customs are pure, and lawsuits never reach your hall.\nAs prefect, you bring blessings to the people—\nYour heart never fails the court.\n\n**A Chant on Sun and Moon**\n\nThe moon shines, stars grow sparse;\nThe sun rises, the moon fades.\nIf there was a Shao Zhengmao,\nCould there be no Confucius?\n\n**A Chant on Flood and Drought**\n\nYao endured nine years of floods,\nTang seven years of drought.\nWhere now is the skill of their governance?\n\nNine years of floods,\nSeven years of drought—\nHad it not been for Yao and Tang,\nHalf the people would have perished.\n\n**A Chant on Growing Old**\n\nIf I could turn back ten years,\nI might still accomplish something.\nBut in this world,\nThe sun never returns to noon.\nNow I am sixty-six,\nMy decline beyond compare.\nMy will outstrips my

they were in days of old?\nYet I rejoice in one thing that has grown with time—\nThe skill in talk and laughter before the winecup.\n\n**Chant on the Withering Cold**\nPines and cypresses, seen in winter’s grasp,\nAlone reveal the year’s withering cold.\nTheir sound must be heard amid the wind’s embrace,\nTheir hue best viewed beneath the snow’s mantle.\n\n**Matching Rhymes in Thanks for Ren Sifeng’s Gift of the \"Carefree Pillow\" Poem**\nMy lord bestows upon me a carefree pillow,\nFearing my carefree steps have not yet transcended.\nThough body may wander carefree, it has not yet arrived—\nI must join spirit and dream in carefree flight.\n\n**Chant on Qi and Zheng**\nZichan never shrank from Zheng’s smallness,\nYan Ying never wished Qi’s decline.\nHad these two worthies been born in their rightful place,\nTheir talents would have served as kings’ tutors.\n\n**Poem Sent in Place of a Letter to Lü the Keeper of the Treasury**\nThe Zhou king’s eight steeds raced to the ends of the earth,\nYet how could they compare to the marvel of your four treasures?\nThough Zheng and Luo’s winds and mists lie but a hand’s span away,\nI regret I have no way to journey and behold them.\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Vice Director Wang Anzhi After Rain**\nThe scorching toil of summer’s nine ten-day spans now past,\nA single rain revives all things.\nThe frogs’ drums are not worth hearing,\nThe mosquitoes’ thunder not easily driven off.\nNot only does it ease the year’s provisions,\nBut also settles the officials’ dues.\nFor a wanderer at leisure beneath the trees,\nWhy not delight in this moment?\n\n**Matching Rhymes in Response to Minister He’s Gift**\nI deemed myself unfit for the world’s affairs,\nPassing winter and summer behind barred gates.\nThe path to blue clouds is smooth, yet I rise without merit,\nAmid sparse green bamboo, I find my share of leisure.\nStill, bright flowers reward my simple aspirations,\nAnd fine wine brings a flush to my cheeks.\nLately, the signs of age weigh heavily upon me—\nI fear such gifted talents are not easily matched.\n\n**Chant on Purity and Harmony**\nPure but not harmonious—narrow and full of coarseness.\nHarmonious but not pure—indolent and lacking in propriety.\nTo be both harmonious and pure,\nRighteousness has no fixed form.\nMove when the time is right to move,\nHalt when the time is right to halt.\n\n**Chant on Similarity and Difference**\nBrilliance and swiftness risk fragmentation,\nWeightiness and gravity risk stagnation.\nPursuits follow what one esteems,\nYet cannot escape similarity or difference.\nWhat differs from oneself must be wrong,\nWhat aligns with oneself must be right.\nRight and wrong wage war over similarity and difference,\nAnd one may pass a lifetime without knowing righteousness.\n\n**Chant on the Moment**\nIn life, one seeks to please others;\nIn death, one seeks to please the spirits.\nPleasing others may bring wealth and honor,\nPleasing spirits may avert blame and calamity.\nThough life and death follow different paths,\nAre the principles of men and spirits truly distinct?\nAlas, such overuse of the heart—\nWhen will these vain intentions cease?\n\n**Chant on Observing Things**\nEars sharp, eyes bright—a man’s body,\nEndowed by the great potter’s hand, not born poor.\nOnly by delving into the moon’s cavern can one know things,\nWithout treading the heaven’s root, how can one recognize men?\nWhen Qian meets Xun, observe the moon’s cavern;\nWhere earth meets thunder, behold the heaven’s root.\nRoaming between heaven’s root and the moon’s cavern,\nAll thirty-six palaces bloom with spring.\n\nThe simple and honest lack keen insight,\nThe keenly insightful lack careful discernment.\nHow might one find both simplicity and keen insight,\nTo speak with them of the world’s affairs?\n\n**Chant Over Wine**\nWith wine, I often raise a cup,\nNow nearing seventy, what more do I seek?\nTeeth failing, marriages and betrothals not yet settled,\nYears of drought, fields yielding but a meager harvest.\nGuests depart, and at times I fold my hands in leisure,\nThe sun high, with nothing to do, I quietly comb my hair.\nFrost-touched locks do more than adorn poetic scenes—\nThey may yet serve as subjects for a painter’s brush.\n\n**Chant on Autumn Thoughts**\nA season of spring has barely passed,\nWhen geese from beyond the clouds announce their return.\nThe turning of seasons comes before my eyes like this,\nWhile the years slip from my head thus.\nThough the ambitions of youth remain,\nHow can these sinews and bones not weaken?\nYet I rely on this inch of heart, ever glad—\nEven the sages’ hardest truths I can comprehend.\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Vice Director Wang Anzhi on an Autumn Outing**\nSpring and summer have come and gone, fit for poetry,\nYet though fit for poetry, what use is it?\nOften empty like Yanzi,\nYet far from matching Huizi in traversing things.\nThe mood of wind and moon is beyond bearing,\nThe sentiment of clouds and mountains cannot be contained.\nA song, a chant—let us exchange verses,\nDaring to match Anzhi and Jingzhi.\n\n*Zhang Shaoqing Tuan, styled Jingzhi.*\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Wang Anzhi on Attending the Autumn Gathering of Prefect Wang Xuanhui at the Luo Society**\nFrom the inner chambers, guests and kin emerge,\nMusic played to new melodies, divinely inspired.\nWhen red candles burn bright, sleeves of green flutter,\nWhere painted oars pause, green duckweed is claimed.\nOnce a visitor to the golden halls of early years,\nNow one soon to depart the Phoenix Pool.\nYour estate crowns the capital, called \"Snail’s Retreat\"—\nHow dare Shao Yaofu presume to be your western neighbor?\n\n**Poem Expressing Shame for Failing the Three Appointments at Heyang, Heqing, and Jiyuan**\nAutumn rains linger, the mud slick and deep,\nDay after day, when will the skies clear?\nDear friends long for my arrival,\nYet my frail frame, averse to cold, cannot journey far.\nThough the distance is not great,\nTwice I set out, twice failed to fulfill the promise.\nTwo matters war within my breast,\nLeaning on my desk, I sit in sorrow, finding no peace.\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Vice Director Wang Anzhi’s Poem on an Autumn Engagement**\nRise and fall—why debate such things?\nIn the end, all matters even out.\nA patch of fleabane and mugwort,\nA body of clouds and waters for a thousand years.\nThe harvest comes at just the right time,\nThe cold and warmth of qi begin to balance.\nFrom now on, let our meetings bring joy—\nGentlemen, do not weary of their frequency.\n\n**Poem to My Eldest Son, Bowen, on His Failure in the Examinations**\nWhat the Confucians esteem\nAre conduct and righteousness, and literary composition.\nSuccess or failure is never certain,\nFlourishing or withering not easily measured.\nStriving must be diligent,\nGain and loss are the common lot.\nExternal things cannot be relied upon—\nHis words carry a profound flavor.\n\n**Year’s End Poem to Myself**\nThe Way of Heaven has no eternal spring,\nThe Way of Earth no constant treasure.\nOnly those who receive the harmonious qi of the mean\nCan become men of pure excellence.\nGood fields yield abundant millet,\nPoor soil suffices for brambles and thorns.\nThe ailanthus and mugwort,\nAre fit only to serve as kindling.\nThough born as the spirit of the myriad things,\nOne must possess their essence.\nWithout the spirit of the myriad things,\nOne is but a mere part of their kind.\nTo utter the rarest words,\nOne must harbor the rarest intent.\nTo manifest the fairest name,\nOne must perform the fairest deeds.\nAiding the times is a fair deed,\nEnlightening the lord is a rare intent.\nAlas, of these two,\nI alone possess neither.\n\n**Chant on a Gentleman’s Wine-Drinking**\nFather kind, son filial,\nElder brother friendly, younger brother respectful.\nHousehold well-provided, people content,\nTimes harmonious, years abundant.",

profit,\nStrife and anger naturally abound.\n\n**Chant on Gold and Jade**\nThe sage emerges from among men,\nThe heart is cultivated through conduct.\nGold is found within the sand,\nJade is sought within the stone.\n\n**Chant on Wind and Frost**\nGrass bends before the wind,\nGrass withers before the frost.\nThe pine sings before the wind,\nThe pine stands firm before the frost.\nTo bend before the wind, to wither before the frost—\nHow can one be said to exist or perish?\n\n**Chant on High and Low**\nFrom below, looking up—\nBoundless wealth and honor.\nFrom above, looking down—\nBoundless baseness and poverty.\nFrom the mind, observing things—\nWhat thing can be one?\nFrom things, observing the mind—\nWhat mind is not equal?\n\n**Chant on My Five-Roomed Hut**\nThough my hut is small, it roughly shelters me,\nAt least sparing me the shame of renting another’s lodging.\nMany in this world have no house to live in,\nBegging warmth beneath another’s eaves.\n\n**Returning from Viewing Apricot Blossoms by the Chan River**\nEast of the Chan River, apricot blossoms open,\nBeyond the flowers, by Tianjin Bridge, I turn back at dusk.\nI pluck an apricot blossom to wear in my hair,\nTo let others know I’ve come to see the flowers.\n\n**Chant on Taking a Wife**\nWhen a man takes a wife,\nLet her have beauty, virtue, dignity, and bearing.\nShould she bear a son,\nLet him be a Gao Yao or a Kui.\n\n**Chant on Good Deeds**\nGood deeds are surely hard to force,\nWorthy men must be sought with heart.\nThe floating life of sun and moon is not long—\nOnce time passes, a thousand regrets,

Entangled in cares.\nWhy sleep? Free of affairs.\n\n**Two Zhegu Chants**\nIn the world, gold is prized above all—\nWho says gold cannot be found?\nWithout idle words or refined intent,\nWhat else can gladden a good heart?\nDistant mountains on all sides offer pure freshness,\nHidden birds in a thousand songs send sweet sounds.\nThough boundless spring has faded away,\nPray, listen to the zhegu’s cry.\n\nDeep in emerald bamboo groves, the zhegu calls,\nIts voice more stirring than the wine-pourer’s song.\nNorth and south of the river, they ever follow,\nAfter spring, before spring, they call of their own accord.\nExiled officials, hearts broken, startle from dreams;\nTraveling soldiers, tears soak their collars.\nHearing it in sorrow, the bowels first sever—\nCan such grief be endured?\n\n**Primordial Chant**\nIf asked of the Primordial—there is not a single word;\nOnly in the Later Heaven does effort begin.\nBoasting strength to move mountains and overshadow the age—\nAt this, can one force even a hair’s worth?\n\n**Self-Joy Chant**\nThe qilin and phoenix have never left the wilds;\nIn times of peace, why fret and clamor?\nHearing of good deeds, my heart rejoices first;\nSeeing rare books, my hands copy them myself.\nBeneath bamboo, a tile’s worth of clear spring flows;\nAtop pines, two rods of red sun rise.\nAwake in my nest, I sit before it—\nHow could idle words dispel guests’ mockery?\n\n**People’s Sentiments Chant**\nWhen the people’s hearts are joyful, harmonious qi brings blessings.\nWhen the people’s hearts are troubled, harsh qi brings calamity.\nBlessings are like rain and dew—all under heaven prospers.\nCalamity is like flood and drought—all under heaven suffers famine.\n\n**Peony Chant**\nThe peony’s grace outshines all flowers,\nAnd among them, some are kings.\nFour hues transform into a hundred,\nA hundred hues, a hundred fragrances.\n\n**Letter in Verse Chant**\nGold must be smelted a hundred times to know its purity;\nHow can a water-mirror compare to a man’s discernment?\nNot discarding old friends, one preserves them;\nHow dare one forget lifelong bonds?\nAffairs of state demand practical words;\nThe Dao and virtue rest on sincerity alone.\nBefore the myriad grasses and trees,\nOnly the pine and cassia stay green through the cold.\n\n**Minor Illness Chant**\nWhen illness is slight, none suspect it;\nWhen it deepens, medicine cannot cure.\nThrough diligence and humility, one ends well;\nThrough confusion and relapse, great loss follows.\nBetween self and things, no room for a hair’s breadth;\nBetween heaven and man, how can a thread intrude?\nKnowing ancient joy is like present joy—\nHow many needless words are spared?\n\n**Borrowed Poems**\nPoems wild, books unconstrained—\nIn recent years, they’ve multiplied beyond count.\nMost have scattered across the world,\nUnreturned to the Nest of Peace.\n\n**Effortless Chant**\nIn life, no forced verses,\nNo striving for depth in brush or ink.\nThe brush moves as the nature flows;\nThe poem forms to express the heart.\nPoetry soars with the heart’s creativity,\nThe brush blooms like a garden of the mind.\nWhat I delight in is my own delight—\nDelight without excess.\n\n**Myriad Things Chant**\nAll things are complete within oneself;\nHeaven and earth do not fail man.\nTime slips away like grass in the wind;\nAffairs fall into routine.\nGrieving that youth fades,\nStartled by new white hairs.\nIf the heart holds nothing,\nOne becomes but dust—or flees like dust.\n\n**Moon’s Hollow Chant**\nThe Moon’s Hollow and Heaven’s Root,\nBetween them, frequent comings and goings.\nWherever one dwells, all is ample;\nWherever one goes, all is at ease.\nEach step finds its place;\nThe heart is full of spring.\nWithout poetry and wine,\nHow greatly one would be diminished!\n\n**Great Image Chant**\nThe Great Image is empty at its core,\nIts emptiness truly unchanging.\nIn action, it is the heart’s work;\nIn response, the mouth’s skill.\nRelying on capacity, a thousand things exist;\nWith a single care, none remain.\nWho knows this principle\nOutweighs reading five cartloads of books.\n\n**Hundred Ills Chant**\nA hundred ills arise from feeling;\nLight feeling, light illness.\nCan one be without attachments?\nYet there is always something to rely on.\nAutumn moon, a thousand mountains still;\nSpring blossoms, ten thousand trees flourish.\nIf speaking of true work,\nHuman effort cannot contrive it.\n\n**Small Cart Chant**\nSpring’s warmth not yet oppressive,\nAutumn’s chill not yet severe.\nThe small cart follows whim;\nWherever it goes, joy arises.\n\n**Striking the Earth Chant**\nThree thousand poems of *Striking the Earth*,\nTwelve households of *Moving Nests*.\nTaking joy as one’s work,\nCultivating the will as one’s livelihood.\nComing and going as one pleases,\nVisiting in a small cart.\nWho knows this joy\nNeeds not wait for splendor?\n\n**Two Poems Left at the Northern Waters of Yang, Gentleman

dwelling?\nYet who else buys one like yours?\n\nA scene of radiance, no dust of this world,\nLandscape through four seasons, a true painted scroll.\nThe rear garden’s blossoms, rare as those of Penglai,\nThe front pavilion’s peaks, fine as those of Penglai’s isles.\n\nTo grow old in such a place—\nThis too is the mark of a hero in the world.\n\n**Chant at Autumn’s End**\nWithin days, autumn is spent,\nA hundred thoughts cannot console its passing.\nThe garden’s beauty, though loved without end,\nYet grasses and trees yellow—what can feeling do?\n\nThough aged, my limbs still strong,\nFrom every high terrace, my gaze still far.\nAll day I raise my cup, yet not drunk,\nAgain I long to face the wind and sing boldly.\n\n**Chant of the Unworthy**\nThe unworthy man,\nHis will

strange.\nSeated, I know the nature of things,\nBeyond words, I reach the celestial mechanism.\n\nTo gain a line is not so easy,\nTo complete a verse—how could I bear to discard it?\nWho knows if in a thousand myriad ages,\nA later age will lack its Confucius?\n\n**Chant of Gold**\nOn the body, gold is carried,\nNo man sinks in his journey.\nWhen sought, it may not appear,\nWhen found, not through seeking.\n\nEloquence is not understanding,\nContainment is the completion of the heart.\nOnly when one can play the stringless zither,\nCan one then know the true friend.\n\n**Chant of the Partridge**\nAffairs take on a new form,\nYet newness soon turns old.\nNew and old are not beneficial things,\nPrinciple does not follow man.\n\nDo not fear the lateness of years,\nOrioles and blossoms will herald spring again.\nMy remaining cup, fortunately unharmed,\nFitting to sing the partridge’s song often.\n\n**Chant of Leisure**\nIn leisure, the flavor lingers long,\nThe long place is the land of immortals.\nAbundant is the joy of forests and springs,\nPure, without the clamor of markets.\n\nFreely roaming the mysteries of a thousand sages,\nDrunk, embracing the fragrance of ten thousand flowers.\nDo not make matters of heartbreak,\nHeartbreak easily severs the bowels.\n\nIn leisure, the flavor is true,\nThe true place is the people of heaven.\nAbundant is the joy of forests

of the Vast Blue**\nEvery person bears the sky,\nDo I bear it in vain?\nOne must know the principle of heaven and man,\nOnly then to know the power of creation.\n\nMerit and fame return to the wine cup,\nVessels and deeds enter the poem.\nI reckon the joy of leisure,\nNone compares to my wholeness.\n\n**Chant of the Round**\nLike a mirror, like a hook,\nRevolving, autumn unremembered.\nHard to fathom the ways of heaven,\nEasy to whiten the heads of the world.\n\nIn fullness, all rejoice,\nIn waning, all things grieve.\nThere is no life without breath,\nWhy wait for the ox of Wu to pant?\n\n**Chant in Place of a Letter**\nA year and more since we parted,\nAt year’s end, our thoughts turn to the beginning.\nAgain I trouble you with warmth,\nTo send afar my emptiness.\n\nA hundred forms of decay and ruin,\nYet not a single care.\nIdle chanting of forty words,\nTo briefly answer your letter.\n\n**Chant of the Lost Poem**\nWithin my breast, wind and rain roar,\nBeneath my brush,

Men**\nThe noble one knows men through understanding,\nThe petty man knows men through self-interest.\nThrough understanding,\nThose in accord with principle are deemed right, those at odds are deemed wrong.\nThrough self-interest,\nThose in accord with oneself are deemed right, those at odds are deemed wrong.\n\n**Chant of Words and Deeds**\nTo speak well is not difficult,\nTo act is the true

at the morrow yet to arrive.\nThis juncture is easily grasped,\nYet none refuse its fleeting sign.\nWho knows this truth may guard their affairs,\nBut few can fathom its design.\n\n**“Cup and Plate Chant”**\nBeneath the trees, cups and plates lie still in quietude,\nAnd long I wish this quietude would last as now it does.\nBehold those who beat drums and strike bells—\nOnce their power wanes, friends are not easily called.\n\n**“Joyful Chant”**\nPraise the good, not the ill,\nRemember kindness, not grudges.\nLet each rejoice in themselves,\nWhat need to lament few companions?\n\n**“Virtuous Chant”**\nGood as gold and jade,\nWeighty as hills and mountains,\nDignified as phoenix and simurgh,\nFragrant as orchid and angelica.\n\n**“Discourse Chant”**\nIf a matter is wrong, it stands apart.\nIf a matter is right, how could there be two ways?\n\n**“Sincerity Chant”**\nThough heaven does not speak, man may speak,\nYet when the heart may be deceived, heaven may be deceived.\nHeaven and man are not far apart,\nBut only in the human heart do men not see.\nThe human heart precedes heaven, and heaven does not oppose it;\nThe human body follows heaven, serving its time.\nBody and heart are not far apart,\nBut only in human sincerity do men not reflect.\n\n**“Yaofu’s Chant”**\nYaofu chants: the world calls me dull,\nComing without season, going without measure.\nLike mountains and rivers, my path knows no end;\nLike streams and seas, my flow knows no cease.\nLike orchid and angelica, my fragrance never fades;\nLike the *Xiaoshao* music, my sound never breaks.\nThere are flowers, there is snow,\nThere is wind, there is moon.\nNow gentle, now stern;\nNow refined, now fervent.\n\n**“Unexpected Chant”**\nWhen matters arise beyond expectation,\nForesight cannot grasp them.\nIf not moved by recklessness,\nWhy indulge in needless sorrow?\nEven in error there may be fortune,\nAnd in darkness, unseen guidance.\nWho understands this truth,\nWhat worry remains under heaven?\n\n**“Decisive Chant”**\nDecide to resolve doubt—doubt must not linger.\nTo hesitate when one should decide\nIs to invite chaos in return.\n\n**“Dream of Worry Chant”**\nThe perfected have no dreams,\nThe sages have no worries.\nDreams come from overthinking,\nWorries from overreaching.\nIf worries do not arise,\nFrom where do dreams come?\nWho understands this truth,\nWhat more need they cultivate?\n\n**“Human Sentiment Chant”**\nTo understand human sentiment,\nNeither narrow nor broad.\nAll under heaven’s affairs\nAre as clear as one’s palm.\n\n**“Human Affairs Chant”**\nMen must not act carelessly,\nMatters must not be left to drift.\nDrifting loses the moment,\nCarelessness corrupts the man.\nMen must not act rashly,\nMatters prize attentiveness.\nRashness leans toward shallowness,\nAttentiveness leans toward sincerity.\n\n**“Teacher and Resource Chant”**\nNot yet knowing the Dao’s meaning,\nOne seeks others as teachers.\nOnce knowing the Dao’s meaning,\nOthers come as resources.\nSeeking teachers is not easy,\nBeing a resource is truly hard.\nPointing south to guide the Way,\nNeither departing nor returning.\nTo feel shame at teaching others,\nTo feel joy at being taught—\nBoth are misplaced.\nI alone am free of this.\nTo delight in teaching others,\nHow is this different from obstinacy?\n\n**“Heaven and Man Chant”**\nHeaven’s study is to cultivate the heart,\nMan’s study is to cultivate the body.\nWhen body is at peace and heart is joyful,\nThen heaven and man are seen.\nHeaven and man are not far apart,\nYet few know this—\nThose who do are rare.\nThe body is governed by man,\nThe heart is governed by heaven.\nIf the heart is not joyful,\nHow can the body be at peace?\n\n**“Yue Yi Chant”**\nWhen Yue Yi served Yan,\nHis heart held a profound intent.\nBreaking Qi’s seventy cities,\nHis blade met no resistance.\nWhy spare Jimo and Ju?\nYet his loyalty to Yan remained unbroken.\nHe wished for Yan to become king,\nAnd for all under heaven to begin with Qi.\nWas his will not yet fulfilled\nWhen King Zhao suddenly died?\nKing Hui, ignorant of his worth,\nSent another to replace him.\nMighty Yan declined from then,\nNever again to rise.\nSince ancient times, lord and minister—\nTheir meeting is not easily found.\nHow precious are these thousand myriad years,\nThat move even heroes to tears.\n\n**“The Perfect Ten Chant”**\nWhat is called a perfect man?\nOne must possess perfect truth.\nNot merely one who writes well,\nNor one who composes fine prose.\nNot for fine brows and bright eyes,\nNor for new robes and fresh clothes.\nTo walk in the world of men,\nOne must first perfect the self.\n\nWhat is called a perfect man?\nOne must accomplish perfect deeds.\nIf deeds are not perfect,\nThey remain incomplete.\nServing one’s father with whole heart,\nServing one’s elder brother with whole intent,\nServing one’s lord with whole loyalty,\nServing one’s teacher with whole duty.\nA man’s life spans a hundred years,\nHow easily it passes!\nThough but a fleeting moment,\nHow much transpires within!\nTo be called one who completes affairs,\nOne must first complete the self.\nIf the self is not yet complete,\nHow can one complete others?\n\n**“Birthday Chant”**\n*Cyclic signs: Xin-Hai, twelfth month, twenty-fifth day*\nYear: Xin-Hai, month: Xin-Chou,\nDay: Jia-Zi, hour: Jia-Xu.\nDay and hour share Jia,\nYear and month share Xin.\nAt this moment,\nI was born into this world as man.\n\n**“Admonition to My Sons Chant”**\nThe rooster can herald dawn,\nThe horse can take one’s place in travel,\nThe dog can guard and defend,\nThe ox can plow the fields.\nMan, born between heaven and earth,\nSpirit of all things—\nYet envying the worthy and resenting the able,\nBetter not to have been born at all.\n\n**“The Constant Chant”**\nHeaven and earth have constant principles,\nSun and moon have constant brightness.\nThe four seasons have constant order,\nGhosts and spirits have constant numinosity.\nThe sage has constant virtue,\nThe petty man has no constant disposition.\n\n**“Yearning Chant”**\nThe world’s splendor fades from sight,\nBefore my eyes, only books command reverence.\nThough a hundred thousand hardships still startle,\nThe years before thirty were the most bitter.\nIn youth, I knew only perilous paths,\nIn old age, I recognize the peace of ease.\nFortunate that my family’s legacy has heirs,\nEnough to wander carefree with the white clouds.\n\n**“Spring Chant”**\nA piece of spring lies before my eyes,\nBefore my eyes, know this good spring.\nSpring, autumn, winter, summer—free of burdens,\nSnow, moon, wind, flowers—all flow as one.\nTo use true richness for one’s work,\nWhy fear other things harming its warmth and beauty?\nHow fortunate is my life—what abundance!\nHow could idle sorrows reach my ears?\n\n**“Nearly There Chant”**\nTo demand saintliness of others\nIs surely not yet complete.\nTo expect humanity from others\nLeaves room for improvement.\nHolding others to account is not hard,\nBut receiving reproach is not easy.\nTo be nearly there—\nOne still looks to Yanzi.\n\n**“People and Things Chant”**\nPeople flourish and must decline,\nThings arise and must perish.",

eyes,\nThey must be pondered in the heart.\nPassing by, one has not fully seen;\nPondering, one is willing to seek thoroughly.\nOnly by thorough seeking can one see,\nAnd only then is it true gold.\nWhat is true gold?\nTrue gold sinks into the bones.\nHaving endured forging and tempering,\nIt is worthy and needs no contemplation.\nOnce in hand, what need is there for eyes?\nIn conduct, how dare one be careless?\nCarefree only after being at ease,\nIn the world there are those who understand.\nWhat are those who understand?\nThose who understand reside only in the heart.\nThe liver and

four directions would be like limbs.\nHow majestic were Yao and Shun,\nHow could they be named?\n\n**“History and Painting Chant”**\nThe historian’s brush excels at recording events,\nThe painter’s brush excels at depicting things.\nDepicting things and recording events,\nEach excels in one.\nPoetry as history excels at recording intent,\nPoetry and painting excel at depicting emotion.\nDepicting emotion and recording intent,\nBoth can be precise.\nDepicting emotion does not depict things,\nRecording intent does not record events.\nForm and appearance emerge from creation,\nImagination completes Heaven and Earth.\nSubstance and function thus divide,\nEven ghosts and spirits dare not differ.\nWhat is poetry if not this?\nIt is history and painting combined.\n\n**“Competition Chant”**\nPeople have no love of competition,\nAffairs have no excess of seeking.\nCompetition brings much humiliation,\nExcessive seeking brings much sorrow.\nSorrow and humiliation arrive together,\nAnd virtue does not wander.\nNot only does it harm others,\nIt also becomes the body’s enemy.\n\n**“Governing the Heart Chant”**\nThe heart is closer than the body,\nThe body is closer than others.\nIf one cannot govern the heart,\nHow can one govern the body?\nIf one cannot govern the body,\nHow can one govern others?\n\n**“My Hut Chant”**\nI too love my hut,\nMy hut resembles a rustic dwelling.\nMy nature follows the Dao, shared with the heavens,\nMy body is distant from the world.\nEverywhere, fragrant grasses grow,\nOn my bed, disordered books pile.\nSince there have been no affairs,\nI no longer apply effort.\n\n**“Human Spirit Chant”**\nHeaven and Earth give birth to the myriad things,\nAmong them, humans are the most spiritually endowed.\nHaving the spirit of humanity,\nOne must also have human emotions.\nWithout human emotions,\nOne merely has the form of a human.\n\n**“Passing By Chant”**\nDo not be startled by things passing by in profusion,\nAs gains and losses grind against each other, never settling.\nThough skills may be many, they have no real effect,\nAnd when cleverness reaches its peak, it is but an empty name.\nThe warmth, coolness, cold, and heat of the four seasons,\nThe sweet, bitter, pungent, and sour of the myriad things.\nApart from this heart, all are external things,\nYet even this heart may not be fully awakened.\n\n**“Disaster Chant”**\nDisaster from without\nCan still be dispelled.\nDisaster from within,\nHow can it be withstood?\nBetween Heaven and humanity,\nExamine both within and without.\n\n**“Within and Without Chant”**\nEyes, ears, nose, and mouth,\nAre humanity’s doors and windows.\nHeart, gall, spleen, and kidneys,\nAre humanity’s inner currents.\nIf one can guard within,\nWithout will not be received.\nIf within there is no guard,\nHow can without endure?\n\n**“Fame and Profit Chant”**\nWeighing heavily with fame\nReveals others’ emotions.\nEnriching with profit\nReveals others’ intentions.\nEmotions and intentions are within,\nIf within is weighty, without is light.\nFame and profit are without,\nIf within is base, without is noble.\n\n**“Name and Reality Chant”**\nWithin, there is no reality,\nWithout, there is a name—\nThe petty person thus boasts.\nWithout, there is no name,\nWithin, there is reality—\nWhat does the noble person lose?\n\n**“Nature and Emotion Chant”**\nThe noble person follows nature,\nThe petty person follows emotion.\nFollowing nature, one draws near,\nFollowing emotion, one drifts far.\n\n**“Exhortation Chant”**\nPeople should not be negligent,\nAffairs value earnestness.\nNegligence approaches shallowness,\nEarnestness approaches sincerity.\n\n**“Doubt and Trust Chant”**\nPeople should not be credulous,\nAffairs should not be doubted excessively.\nCredulity invites provocation,\nExcessive doubt invites separation.\n\n**“Order and Chaos Chant”**\nNoble persons and petty persons\nOften stand in equal measure.\nSometimes they halt, sometimes they act,\nNow in order, now in chaos.\n\n**“Timeliness Chant”**\nThe dragon does not leap in winter,\nThe firefly can fly at night.\nPetty persons and noble persons,\nAll have their time.\n\n**“Loyalty and Thickness Chant”**\nThe petty person is momentary,\nThe noble person endures.\nMomentary, they incline toward perversity,\nEnduring, they remain loyal and sincere.\n\n**“Deep Winter Chant”**\nThe twelfth month draws to a close,\nAnd one is startled that the year’s rhythm is exhausted.\nIce is stored in the northern lands,\nThe thaw has not yet come with the east wind.\nIn the dimness, one vainly seeks green,\nOn the flower branches, one forces a search for red.\nSeeking spring, spring is not seen,\nIt is only within the breast.\n\n**“Knowing Wrong Chant”**\nAll that came before today,\nKnowing wrong, the heart can rely on.\nEmpty words are not worth speaking,\nTrue conduct—what need for pride?\nThere is no medicine for aging,\nBut there is poetry to praise sagely brightness.\nThough one may drink at times,\nOne need not imitate Liu Ling.\n\n**“Winter Solstice Chant”**\nAt the winter solstice, midnight’s

wine,\nIllness cured by a skilled physician.\n\nWhen the principles of things dawn,\nWhen human sentiments are laid bare—\nA single word can\nResolve a century’s confusion.\n\nWhen the principles of things dawn,\nWhen human sentiments are laid bare—\nWithin sentiment, the essence of things is clear,\nBeyond principle, the workings of heaven revealed.\n\nWhen the principles of things dawn,\nWhen

arrives—how earnest!\nAre there not worthy men in all directions?\nYet a thousand *li* away, I still think of old friends.\nHaving seen much of the world, I know what to accept or reject,\nLong familiar with human nature, I discern closeness and distance.\nNow I grow old, content in decline,\nOffering no aid to this bright age, I recline by the Luo’s banks.\n\n**\"Long and Short

other knowledge remains,\nOnly the appointed time of the second month.\nWine is tasted when newly brewed,\nFlowers are admired at half-bloom.\nThere is only the joy of intoxication,\nNo sorrow of reckless abandon.\nWho can preserve this scene,\nAnd store it forever in heart and spleen?\n\n**\"Third Month Chant\"**\nAll day through the city, spring’s departure is pursued,\nYet those who chase it know its numbered days.\nDoes the true Master ever fail to bring forth life?\nYet wanderers have no certainty to rely upon.\nPear blossoms, drenched in rain, dissolve into weeping,\nWillow fluff, stirred by wind, refuses to settle.\nA moment of clarity holds boundless good intent—\nAlas, such intent is hard to bestow.\n\n**\"First-Rank Chant\"**\nTo utter words of the first rank,\nOne must possess a mind of the first rank.\nTo become a person of the first rank,\nOne must perform deeds of the first rank.\n\n**\"All Things Chant\"**\nSuccess and failure must be left to fate,\nRise and decline each have their season.\nThough petty men indulge in endless desire,\nHow could the true Master permit partiality?\nThis fleeting joy,\nSoon turns to hollow sorrow.\nBehold: when spring departs,\nFor whom do the wanderers roam?\n\n**\"Luoyang Spring Chant\"**\nNo place in the four directions rivals Luoyang’s beauty,\nNo season in the year surpasses spring’s blossoms.\nIn beauty and bloom lies exquisite subtlety—\nYet who but the idle can receive such grace?\nLuoyang’s people are accustomed to rare blossoms,\nPeach and plum flowers scarcely count as flowers.\nOnly when the peonies burst into full glory\nDoes the entire city rejoice without end.\n\nPeach and plum flowers bloom, yet none pause to gaze—\nTheir season is but a prelude to the peony’s hour.\nWhen peonies bloom, wine’s price soars,\nAnd midnight finds revelers still abroad.\nTime refuses even a moment’s respite:\nNinety days of spring vanish once more.\nHow many fallen petals drift without refuge,\nHalf carried by streams, half swept by wind?\n\nSpring departs, flowers fade, the days grow long,\nSwallows chatter, orioles sing, each absorbed in their own haste.\nWhy do wanderers cease their comings and goings?\nThe green shade is no less rich than the red bloom.\nTen days, and the finest flowers are gone—\nPity the Green Emperor’s laborious craft.\nWanderers, do not despair of certainty:\nThe red bloom may not surpass the green.\n\nWhere, after all, does spring retreat?\nCountless spring grievances remain unvoiced.\nI would entrust the warbler to ask the reason,\nBut the cuckoo only cries, *\"Better to leave!\"*\n\nThe four seasons complete a year’s cycle,\nYet only spring reveals such splendid blossoms.\nTen thousand coins for wine are no extravagance—\nOnce the red bloom fades, will it ever return?\n\n**\"Self-Admonition\"**\nAt sixty-seven years,\nI live as a man of this world.\nFrom a land of central uprightness,\nMy body contains all things.\nBeyond heaven, no greater joy exists,\nWithin my breast, another spring abides.\n\n**\"Falling Flowers Chant\"**\nTen thousand purples, a thousand reds—everywhere they fly,\nA riverbank of peach and plum blossoms forms a careless path.\nAs fierce wind and torrential rain approach dusk,\nThe dancing pavilions and singing terraces grow sparse.\nFloating on water, how can they find stability?\nScattered along the wayside, they have no refuge.\nThe warbler need not speak many words—\nWith each passing moment, spring has already gone.\n\n**\"Late Spring Chant\"**\nFlowers bloom—spring is at its finest,\nFlowers fade—spring draws to a close.\nWho would have thought the cuckoo,\nStill able to cry, *\"Return!\"*\n\nSpring arrives, butterflies flutter in chaos,\nSpring departs, the cuckoo weeps.\nHow can it be as before,\nWhen the warm breeze first stirred?\n\nBirds do not comprehend human feeling,\nThey only know spring is ending.\nSometimes they call *\"Pour the wine!\"*\nSometimes they cry *\"Go home!\"*\n\n**\"Coin Chant\"**\nCalled \"spring and cloth,\" yet footless, they traverse the world.\nDifficult to speak of their virtuous issuance,\nThey can open faces that never smile.\nThey repay the small debt of a life extended,\nThey relieve urgent needs like the great elixir.\nOnly the old men of Shang Mountain,\nCannot be bought with them—leisure.\n\n**\"Peony Chant\"**\nOne hue, one fragrance—yet the fragrance is celestial,\nThe color unlike all others.\nThe true Master’s craftsmanship is exquisite—\nNot something human intent can fathom.\n\n**\"In Memory of Academician Zhang Zihou of Fengxiang\"**\nHalf the realm of Qin’s mountains and rivers,\nNurturing genius through the ages.\nHow many worthies have graced the past?\nWhat era has lacked men to revive its pure wind?\n\n**\"Self-Conduct Chant\"**\nHow does Yaofu conduct himself?\nThe entire city of Luoyang feels like home.\nHaving no virtue to set myself apart,\nI follow things with utmost sincerity—nothing more.\nBefore my eyes, I see only the web of heaven’s offices,\nWho notices the changing years above my head?\nNot only does spring come and go—\nWithin my breast, the four seasons’ flowers always bloom.\n\n**\"Being Human Chant\"**\nTo be human, one must join the human throng;\nWithout joining, one cannot fulfill humanity.\nGreat Shun differed not from others,\nEven Emperor Yao’s kin followed proper order.\nA heart at odds brings illness to the body,\nHarmony in affairs brings spring to the four seas.\nThe heart governs the four limbs—it is the master,\nYet the limbs are even farther from the self.\n\n**\"Primordial Chant\"**\nWho undertakes the work of the Primordial?\nHow does one speak of it, and to whom?\nIf the Primordial can be spoken of,\nWhat lies beyond ruler and subject, father and son?\nThe tricks before our eyes are plain to all,\nThe work within the heart is unknown to the world.\nHeaven, earth, and self are but shifts in position—\nThis body differs not from Fu Xi’s.\n\n**\"Central Harmony Chant\"**\nNature has no other secret—\nOne must recognize central harmony.\nFew words in the heart,\nMany affairs in the world.\nLike timely rain ending a long drought,\nLike medicine reviving one from deep illness.\nIf one thing remains unresolved,\nHow can one manage the ten thousand things?\n\n**\"Four Worthies Chant\"**\nYanguo’s words unfold in rich detail,\nHuishu’s words are concise and apt,\nJunshi’s words flow with ease,\nBochun’s words are both measured and stirring.\nThe four worthies of Luoyang’s gaze,\nStood above all others.\nIn the Xining era of the Great Song,\nThey were the splendor of their time.\n\n**\"Old Age Chant\"**\nThe passing years no longer startle my head,\nOnly my friends’ eyes grow clearer.\nBright moon often viewed from my seat,\nDeep wine not poured for sorrow.\nIf my heart lacks foresight,\nI remain but a youth in the world.\nWhom shall I invite as companion?\nA light boat drifting on rivers and lakes.\n\n**\"Heaven and Earth Chant\"**\nBetween heaven and humanity, how can a needle’s point intrude?\nWhy seek distant truths when the highest principle is near?\nWhen baleful flames rage, they burn all the fiercer,\nWhere grace flows, it soaks all the deeper.",

      "translated_text": "**\"Long March Chant\"**\nThe long-marching soldier yearns for home,\nThe parched people long for rain like thirsting souls.\nFortune and misfortune turn as swiftly as a palm’s flip—\nCould one lie awake at midnight without a sigh?\n\n**\"On the Highest Principle\"**\nAmong the myriad things, humans are called most precious,\nYet sages rise above the people like stars apart.\nA steadfast stone needs no doubt to endure the day,\nBut to know the subtle signs before harm—how few are so divine!\nWithout resolve and courage, good cannot be achieved;\nWith keen discernment, purity is still more prized.\nFortune and misfortune show their signs by gradual steps—\nNot by heaven or earth, but by human hands alone.\n\n**\"Ode to Human Jade\"**\nJade does not value itself—people value it;\nYet why should human worth yield to jade’s purity?\nSo flawless and fair, ever constant and true,\nIts inner light and outer gleam both reveal its essence.\nThough fame may first lie hidden in the stone,\nOnly human hands can carve it into treasure.\nThe ancients are gone and cannot be seen again,\nYet the words of the humble-robed sage were not amiss.\n\n**\"On Deceit\"**\nThe deceitful distrust all others,\nFor the world runs on deceit.\nIf one trusts no one in the world,\nThen no truth remains in speech.\n\n**\"Drinking Wine\"**\nNow and then, a sip of fine wine,\nNurturing heaven’s harmony in place of tea.\nWithout rain, the year turns to dire famine,\nAnd the city’s burden holds no prosperous life.\nDwelling in fields, one must still care for the realm;\nEntrusting affairs to kin, one must still tend the home.\nIf asked what progress age has brought,\nI see only silver added to my temples in the mirror.\n\n**\"On the Joy of Things\"**\nThings have sound, color, scent, and taste;\nHumans have ears, eyes, mouth, and nose.\nAll the world’s things reside within one body—\nLook inward, and nothing is lacking.\n\n**\"Five Poems on Wang Anzhi’s Small Garden\"**\n\n**The Small Garden**\nThe small garden, newly repaired, stays close to home,\nRising to the hill’s crest, descending to the moat.\nLuoyang’s land seems favored beyond compare,\nAnd Tianjin’s visitors arrive without delay.\nIt may rival Penglai’s immortal gardens,\nBut let it not vie with Peach Blossom Spring’s praise.\nI hear a pavilion here grows many herbs—\nYet still lacks the famed *zǐhèchē*.\n\n**The Wild Pavilion**\nA pavilion named \"Wild,\" far from the dusty world,\nWhere Song and Shaos’ misty peaks send gentle winds.\nDays and months, years and seasons—all belong to me;\nWhere else could one seek the realm within the gourd?\n\n**The Humble Pavilion**\nXu You’s plan was not so profound—\nWashing his ears was not as good as stilling his heart.\nHere, one feels as if beyond the world,\nWhere no affairs intrude.\n\n**The Medicinal Pavilion**\nMountain herbs, though many, few can name;\nThe master transplants them and marks each one.\nIf they can truly cure the world’s ills,\nWhy shun the red and purple blooms near the eaves?\n\n**The Evening Glow Pavilion**\nThe high pavilion, newly built, brushes the clouds and mist—\nHow fine that it can hold the fading light!\nNear the path where spring admirers come and go,\nWho now lingers here among the wanderers?\n\n**\"Observing Things\"**\nWater brings rain, fire brings dew,\nEarth brings mist, stone brings hail.\nWater’s wind is cool, fire’s wind is hot,\nEarth’s wind is mild, stone’s wind is sharp.\nWater’s clouds are black, fire’s clouds are red,\nEarth’s clouds are yellow, stone’s clouds are white.\nWater’s thunder rumbles, fire’s thunder crackles,\nEarth’s thunder rolls, stone’s thunder crashes.\n\n**\"Painting Sleep\"**\nDaytime slumber is no easy art,\nFitting even for the age of Fuxi.\nWith a heart free of care after a full meal,\nOne may stroll at leisure, wrapped in quiet.\nBefore noon, orioles trill among the courtyard boughs;\nBy dusk, few visitors tread the flower-lined path.\nBehold the world’s many troubled souls—\nThough their pillows and mats may be cool, they lack this peace.\n\n**\"On Advancing and Retreating\"**\nAdvance and retreat—both paths are called guests;\nWhy trouble the seat with endless debate?\nLower your brows when seated, attending to all;\nSwing your arms when walking, heedless of others.\nTeeth and hair now decline, no longer youth’s days,\nYet in forests and streams, age brings eternal spring.\nDoes anyone know the one who acts without care?\nFor how could favor or disgrace ever reach such a person?\n\n**\"As a Guest\"**\nSuddenly I recall my days as a guest in southern Qin,\nGazing east from Luoyang, blocked by the Qin plains.\nClouds and mountains lie two thousand *li* away,\nNineteen years have passed since then.\nWillow hues—are they not newly graceful?\nRiver sounds—do they not still murmur as before?\nIf this frail body could return once more,\nHow could the feelings of old not fade into the distant past?\n\nSuddenly I recall my days as a guest in eastern Wu,\nWhere my youthful heart first saw the land of water and clouds.\nIsland barbarians dwelt near the wild frontiers,\nTides brought merchants mingling with the sea trade.\nLying down, I watched the vast ocean encircle the earth;\nSitting, I saw the red sun rise from Fusang.\nVain births, vain deaths—how many there are!\nYet the name of \"true man\" is not easily borne.\n\nSuddenly I recall my days as a guest in eastern Wu,\nWhen my spirit soared, delighting in travel.\nClimbing mountains, I never paused lightly,\nAnd never easily ceased with leftover wine.\nA thousand lotus stems perfumed the Chu plains,\nA soft wind filled the sail past Yangzhou.\nLooking back, it was like the dream of Handan—\nIn an instant, thirty autumns have passed.\n\nSuddenly I recall my days as a guest in Taiyuan,\nWhere autumn passed in drinking, yet I did not return.\nDistant mountains, nearby waters—all turned to sorrow,\nHigh towers in slanting sunlight—all became grief.\nYouth could not endure the sight of flowers,\nAnd with too much feeling, tears only stained my robes.\nNow, old in Luoyang’s walls,\nI no longer bear such sorrow in my brows.\n\n**\"Nurturing Life\"**\nGrasp firmly like an infant,\nBreathe strongly like a warrior.\nNeither comes naturally—\nBoth require great effort.\nThe heart is the body’s master,\nThe will is the *qi*’s commander.\nSink the pearl into the deep abyss,\nNurture your own heaven and earth.\n\n**\"Illness\"**\nYaofu was ill for three months,\nWorrying the people of Luoyang.\nNot just friends’ concern,\nBut as if for kin.\nRecommending doctors with earnest hearts,\nSeeking medicine with deep care.\nHow can I repay such kindness as before,\nVisiting their doors to express my thanks?\n\n**\"Severe Illness\"**\nFifty years of peace and joy,\nThen suddenly struck by grave illness.\nStill in the height of summer,\nI lay abed for hundreds of days.\nAcupuncture, moxibustion, and medicines—\nA hundred treatments, yet none took effect.\nI entrust my fate to heaven,\nWhat loss is there in my heart?\n\n**\"Heaven and Humanity\"**\nHeaven gives this body, entrusted to human effort;\nWhen human effort is exhausted, heaven’s decree arrives.\nHeaven and humanity are not a hair’s breadth apart—\nIf even a hair’s breadth exists, they become two.\n\n**\"At Death’s Door\"**\nWith fate, even in peril one does not die;\nWithout fate, even the best medicine is useless.\nOnly entrust one’s fate to heaven—\nBeyond that, who can idly calculate?\n\n**\"Entrusting to Heaven\"**\nHeaven gives me life,\nHeaven takes me in death.\nI entrust all to heaven—\nWhat is there that cannot be?",
      "overlap_context": ",\nOnly my friends’ eyes grow clearer.\nBright moon often viewed from my seat,\nDeep wine not poured for sorrow.\nIf my heart lacks foresight,\nI remain but a youth in the world.\nWhom shall I invite as companion?\nA light boat drifting on rivers and lakes.\n\n**\"Heaven and Earth Chant\"**\nBetween heaven and humanity, how can a needle’s point intrude?\nWhy seek distant truths when the highest principle is near?\nWhen baleful flames rage, they burn all the fiercer,\nWhere grace flows, it soaks all the deeper.",

poetry.\n\n**\"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry\"**\nI do not love to write poetry—\nPoetry is when I recline by my desk.\nCherish every inch of time,\nBoast not of the slightest talent.\nWine, poured for guests, is sipped from small cups;\nVerses that astonish are writ in bold strokes.\nIn no realm do I fail to find contentment—\nI do not love to write poetry.\n\n**\"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry\"**\nI do not love to write poetry—\nPoetry is when I chant of history.\nSince ancient times, all has been but a thousand dreams,\nThe Central Plains reduced to a single chessboard.\nThe golden age of Yao and Shun fades in purple haze,\nThe wars of Tang and Wu wither in the grass.\nGazing on the past, much of the present is revealed—\nI do not love to write poetry.\n\n**\"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry\"**\nI do not love to write poetry—\nPoetry is when I face the wine.\nThough I lack a single good deed in this world,\nMy conduct has erred, known to all four directions.\nIn observing

poetry—\nPoetry is when I laugh at myself.\nIdle and carefree, yet never far from worldly matters,\nMy words now and then reveal heaven’s secrets.\nThe smallest deeds are hardest to establish,\nThe greatest achievements may come with ease.\nSuccess and failure lie beyond all reckoning—\nI do not love to write poetry.\n\n**\"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry\"**\nI do not love to write poetry—\nPoetry is when I yield to my servants.\nThey only shake their heads, saying, “Again, you err,”\nYet no sooner do they turn their feet than they do wrong.\nStriving to build a household, they waste their efforts,\nAnd in their dealings, they mar all they touch.\nThe fault lies in knowing men—none are without flaw—\nI do not love to write poetry.\n\n**\"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry\"**\nI do not love to write poetry—\nPoetry is when I sigh in lament.\nGreat vessels take time to form—one must be patient;\nPetty men are hard to nurture—what doubt remains?\nIf no day brings nine

Rain in the Spring Countryside**\nThe nine wilds stretch endlessly,\nDusk lingers on the crow’s path.\nSeated, I lose sight of distant trees,\nBeyond the gate, the front hills vanish.\nRaincoat-clad farmers rejoice,\nSheltered dwellers idle.\nThe poet’s melancholy deepens,\nYet the sky’s mood begins to lift.\n\n**8. After the Rain in the Spring Countryside**\nThe rain ceases, sweeping away lingering spring,\nHeaven’s light reveals its purest truth.\nA soft carpet of fragrant grass,\nFlowers washed bright as brocade.\nThe wind stirs the oriole’s song,\nMist smooths the willow’s sash.\nHow can I face such a scene,\nAnd idly lie through this prosperous time?\n\n**9. Old Wine in the Spring Countryside**\nFlowers bloom after wind and rain,\nI endure illness, seeking solace.\nThis is not the height of carefree abandon,\nBut what can one do in exhaustion?\nSwallows dart among the rafters,\nWild geese vanish beyond the sky.\nAll is ashen in my heart,\nSilently, the noon hour passes.",

Fallen Flowers in the Spring Countryside**\nLate spring brings wind and rain,\nPetals scatter across the rear garden.\nAt dawn, remnants cling in clusters,\nIn sunlight, crimson flutters in disarray.\nThe fragrant path cannot retain their wrappings,\nTheir delicate hearts refuse further play.\nPeach and plum, though they make the trail,\nLie in silent, tangled ruin.\n\n**To Yang Xuan**\nThe Qi River runs clear and bright,\nIts spring welling from my land.\nWhen its waters reach your home,\nAll is but longing for you.\n\n*The Twentieth Scroll of the Yichuan Ji Rang Collection concludes*\n*(The \"Guanghe Yaofu Shouwei Yin\" and the following sixteen prose-poem pieces were absent in the original Daoist Canon edition; now supplemented from the Wenyuan Pavilion text.)*",
