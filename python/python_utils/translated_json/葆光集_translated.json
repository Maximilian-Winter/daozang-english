  "full_translation": "**Preface to the *Baoguang Collection***\n\nWhen the primordial chaos had yet to divide, it already contained the true essence of Heaven and Earth; as clarity and turbidity began to separate, the subtle workings of yin and yang unfolded. Thus, the Three Powers were established, the myriad transformations completed, all things flourished, and extraordinary persons emerged among humankind.\n\nSuch was the True Person, surnamed Yin, of the illustrious lineage of Cangzhou. His ancestors, born of a single mother, produced nine sons in three births, seven of whom were enfeoffed across eight counties. Thereafter, their cap and sash flourished in splendor—even now, stele inscriptions attest to their renown. Yet the True Person’s achievements surpassed all.\n\nIn childhood, he entered stillness, contemplating the origins of Heaven and Earth’s creation; in youth, he left the household, mastering the secrets of nature, life, and transcendence. He guided others and saved beings, examined the ancients to regulate the present, fathomed the beginnings and ends of all affairs, and ranked the worthies of past and present. His beneficence was vast, his transformations boundless; he embraced all with magnanimity, acted without contention, and though provoked, did not retaliate. Where he desired benevolence, benevolence arose; even the unvirtuous were covered in goodness.\n\nThis was because he grasped the sentiments of alignment and opposition, understood the causes of the hidden and manifest, and though the past could not be admonished, the future could yet be pursued. He knew advance and retreat, preservation and loss, and practiced forbearance in matters great and small. Slander did not sway him, nor did praise or blame alter his course. In all things, he was thoroughly versed, trusting in the ebb and flow to guide his path.\n\nHe moved with the current, blending his traces with the dust; he endured disgrace to secure his person and employed words to admonish the world. His refined verses, inscribed on bamboo and silk, conveyed meaning to ten thousand ages without omission; his dharma teachings, disseminated far, aimed to benefit the present moment.\n\nHe could succeed the Quanzhen in expounding the teachings, chronicle the orthodox lineage to perpetuate its fragrance, open the mysterious gate of all wonders, and point the straight path to the Three Purities. Like the sun of wisdom suspended high, he dispelled the shadows of heresy, greatly revived the ancestral wind, and swept away all malevolence and filth. Thus, his gate and courtyard were pure and bright, his realm cool and serene—banishing the lost paths of dark nights to join the sublime domain of Everlasting Spring.\n\nHe planned to open a numinous pond, planting myriad golden lotuses; to empty the spirit-boat, bearing a single wheel of luminous moon. Yet knowing that people are difficult to discipline and the Dao does not force its way, he cherished the treasure within and sat in forgetfulness, or expressed his cares through play. Without leaving the square inch of his heart, he traversed distant wilds, then grasped the great thousandfold world and contained it within a hair’s tip.\n\nHis mind-field shone bright, illuminating all before perception, hearing, and awareness; his nature-ocean was deep and limpid, perfectly reflecting the cycles of dwelling, decay, and emptiness. Moved, he responded; set aside, he concealed. He was indifferent to non-arising, carefree in quiescence. Unmoving, he transcended the heavens beyond kalpas; ever-present, he abided in the realm before his eyes. All things he examined and penetrated, everywhere he perfected—effortlessly grasping, instantly releasing.\n\nMaster of all gates, he awakened to the myriad dharmas and returned them to the heart; having cultivated across many kalpas, he realized the One Truth and merged with the Dao. Thus, long departed from the dusty world, he dwelled for ages in the immortal realm, roaming freely amid the azure vaults, enjoying the mysteries within the Pure Capital.\n\nAbove, he matched the millennial covenant of his master and father; below, he awaited the appointed time, manifesting his own body on the following day. This is called: the highest ritual has no form, the utmost yielding has no words—embracing the unnameable name of beauty, uniting with the ancient virtue that claims no virtue.\n\nHis causes were auspicious, his reasons selfless. Holding the subtle mechanism of the great Dao, he displayed the elegant model for transforming others. Though trifling conduct may seem insignificant, it ultimately accumulates into great merit. His purity of bearing was sufficient—how could it lack praise?\n\nThese reckless, wild words dare to extol his profound sentiments, unafraid of transgressing the three thousand prohibitions, privately invoking the ten thousand vanished traces of the Master’s truth.\n\nThe *Baoguang Collection* is the work of this True Person. For thirteen years after receiving the teachings, he often sat in the inner chamber of the Baoguang Pavilion within the Baoxuan Hall of the Great Everlasting Spring Palace. Daily, scholar-officials from the capital and esteemed elders from afar came to seek his counsel, request instruction, or solicit poetic exchanges. Sometimes he expressed his feelings to dispel ennui or offered admonitions and encouragement. During his travels through various regions, he also composed colophons and eulogies upon encountering scenic sites.\n\nThe poems, lyrics, songs, and hymns he gathered were arranged in order and divided into three volumes, named after the pavilion. Some say *bao* means \"to conceal,\" signifying the concealment of numinous awareness to prevent its outward dissipation—though responding to myriad changes, it never loses its empty and tranquil essence. *Guang* means \"to illuminate,\" signifying the piercing of darkness to advance unfettered, avoiding pitfalls to enter the realm of the subtle and formless. *Ji* means \"to gather,\" signifying the accumulation of treasures like pearls and jade, deployed to aid the impoverished and suffering.\n\nSuch is the general meaning of this compilation—whether it is apt or not.\n\nOthers say poetry has four refinements: refining words is inferior to refining lines, refining lines to refining structure, and refining structure to refining intent. Intent is the function of aspiration, the culmination of poetic thought. Thus, what is in the heart becomes aspiration, and when spoken, becomes poetry. The completion of poetry need not rely on exquisite words or robust lines. The *Feng* and *Sao* were beautiful in their time, but beauty lies in virtue, and virtue exalts aspiration. Aspiration is endowed by the Dao; moved, it stirs and is entrusted to words; harmonized and regulated, it becomes literature. Literature arises from words, and if words are blameless, then thoughts are without deviation.\n\nTo rectify emotions and nature, clarify gains and losses, uphold loyalty and trust, reject cunning schemes, cease aggression, embrace softness and weakness, treasure compassion and frugality, abandon extravagance and excess, revere lofty integrity, and beautify education—these are the profound attainments of the True Person’s poetry.\n\nAs he said:\n*\"True treasure lies in the heart’s sincere conduct;\nEmpty words from the mouth are hardly marvelous.\"*\n\nAnd again:\n*\"Where the source of wisdom arises, treachery and deceit flourish;\nWhen courtesy and decorum are manifest, the Dao and virtue decline.\"*\n\nAnd again:\n*\"A violent nature often hears of men transformed into tigers;\nA compassionate heart indeed sees trees where dragons take flight.\"*\n\nAnd again:\n*\"Though outer demons assail a thousand times,\nA single true heart knows no fear.\"*\n\nAnd again:\n*\"The noble nature remains unshaken by favor or disgrace;\nThe Dharma King’s body stirs not amid right or wrong.\"*\n\nSuch examples abound throughout these writings—may the reader take heed. For those who grow lax and neglect to read, or act rashly without understanding, alas! What sorrow.\n\nOnly Du Dekang, Magistrate of Qinzhou, was a worthy of this age. Upon seeing this collection, he wished all to hear its message, and thus commissioned artisans to carve woodblocks, that its transmission might spread. May enlightened scholars and those of kindred spirit read these words and grasp their truth, awaken to their principles and find their essence. Then, breaking free from worldly entanglements, they may ascend to the true emptiness, their names inscribed on the cinnabar terrace, forever transcending birth and death—truly the intent of a benevolent heart.\n\nWritten on the Double Ninth of the year *jihai*, by the disciple the Mist-and-Cloud Recluse, with threefold reverence and ablutions.\n\n*Baoguang Collection*, compiled by the Pure Harmony True Person Yin Zhiping.\n\n**Seven-Character Quatrains**\n\n**Golden Mountain**\nFrom Xuande Prefecture to Lord Tian’s Camp—\nsome seven or eight thousand *li*—lies north of Golden Mountain.\nNorthwest the journey nears eight thousand,\nyet southward we pass Golden Mountain.\nGazing southwest from Golden Mountain,\nonly then do the Yin Mountains shimmer faintly in the distance.\n\n**Another**\nOnce I wandered beneath the immortals’ sun,\nfive thousand *li* beyond, the waters part their ways.\nMen know only the eastern sea’s embrace,\nblind to the Great River’s northwest flow.\n\n**Another**\nWest beyond the Yin Mountains, ten thousand *li* and more,\nrange upon range of mountains, river upon river.\nFive times I crossed the Great River,\nyet countless peaks and streams remain unseen.\n\n**Passing the Great Stone Linya of the Qidan State**\n\"Great Stone\" is the Qidan word for \"scholar\"; \"Linya\" is a lesser name.\nThe Central Plains call the Great Stone Linya a state title.\nWhen Liao fell to Jin and lost its homeland,\nthey fled west to the barbarian lands, ten thousand *li* away.\nFor a decade they wandered, rootless,\nuntil settling here to till the soil.\n\n**Another**\nThrough force of arms, the multitudes secured their fields,\nand the Great Stone Linya was hailed as king.\nThough emperors amassed armies of millions,\nnow all lies in decline, the cities desolate.\n\n**The Western Regions’ early seasons**—noted for their advance over the Central Plains.\nTo slake thirst, yellow plums are already tasted;\nto sate hunger, white mulberries are gathered.\nAt the season of Lesser Fullness, early summer’s dawn,\nmulberries ripen, plums yellow, wheat turns gold.\n\n**The Master departs on other business**, and cloud-wandering adepts now seldom darken his door. Thus this verse.\nThe Master gone, friends and companions grow few;\neven kindred spirits seem strangers now.\nWith lofty aims, he forgets worldly affairs—\njust as true feeling should be with me.\n\n**Only Prefect Li of the Household daily visits**\nThis path is hard, each step ascending higher;\nthose who see it dismiss it as vain toil.\nWhat does my friend from Longxi intend?\nStealing moments from his busyness, he comes once a day.\n\n**Self-Reflection**\nWorldly cares no longer stir in me,\nyet my thoughts on the Dao and virtue lack sincerity.\nThough I’ve received the Master’s teachings a thousandfold,\nin every place, I err only in failing to discipline myself.\n\n**Lord Duan retrieves a small fish for release**\nA slender scale begged for, spared the pot,\nreturned to the stream to roam at will.\nSay not that one day it may grow into a whale—\neven now, its leisure brings joy.\n\n**Composed at Baoxuan Hall**\nStepping out, the eye meets the Western Mountains,\nyet for my light karmic ties, I cannot return.\nThough my body lingers in Baoguang, carefree and unrestrained,\nmy heart ever dwells amid the white clouds.\n\n**Matching Academician Chen’s Verse**\nThe Western Mountains, daylong veiled in mist,\nexist because men’s hearts remain unenlightened.\nWho would turn back to ask the woods below?\nThe original face is the true immortal.\n\n**Matching Instructor Zhao’s Verse**\nDo not cling even to a hair’s weight in the field of the heart.\nI charge you: remember these four lines well.\nSeeing no faults in others,\none may be called a master of high virtue.\n\n**For Officer Liu Xuanchai, ill and seeking a poem**\nTo seek lightness and health, find peace,\ntry keeping company with Perpetual Spring in Baoxuan.\nIf you accept a hundred days of abstinence,\nin years to come, your bones will be strong, your spirit whole.\n\n**On receiving the Master’s command to depart for Shandong, bidding farewell to Yanjing—an impromptu quatrain**\nReturning from the Western Regions, ten thousand *li* and more,\nyet still I’ve found no quiet abode.\nWhen at last I reach a place of ease,\nI’ll shut my wicker gate and never leave my hut.\n\n**Matching Daoist Recorder Wang’s Verse**\nAll things know emptiness, coming and going as they will;\nin every thought, the heart’s flowers bloom.\nLet right and wrong pass the ear—ask no more;\nnever let the Dao and virtue slip from mind.\n\n**Another**\nThe teaching wind spreads, meeting Perpetual Spring,\nindiscriminate toward officials or common folk.\nEach is led to the Purple Palace,\neveryone transformed, rising from the red dust.\n\n**The True Person’s \"Heaven and Earth\"**—four quatrains matched in rhyme\n\n**I**\nHeaven’s true immortals, idle yet never idle;\nearth’s fools, self-impeding in their folly.\nUnknowing that the heart is the root and master,\nthey labor in vain, bowing to the ten directions.\n\n**II**\nHeaven’s host of immortals share one heart;\nearth’s myriad dharmas are all empty.\nNot knowing the wondrous oneness of Dao and virtue,\nthey still prattle of west and east.\n\n**III**\nHeaven’s splendor arises from the power of the Dao;\nearth’s forms are shaped by good deeds.\nUnknowing the sagely ones’ expedient means,\nthey cling to delusion, how few see clearly!\n\n**IV**\nHeaven’s true merit is grasped by few;\nearth’s images demand refuge.\nIf one suddenly awakens to the principle of non-birth,\nthis is the highest mechanism of our gate.\n\n**To the Leaders of Yanjing on Performing Merit**\nMerit must be sought through self-denial;\ncultivating truth requires a willing heart at rest.\nThe wise of past and present had few affairs—\nthose perfect in both merit and wisdom stand first.\n\n**Self-Reflection**\nGazing at this frail, weak body,\nmy five organs remain at peace.\nThough I’ve not yet ascended to the azure skies,\nI’m spared this life’s bitter demonic wars.\n\n**Another**\nMen admire the strong as heroes,\nbut I pity the weak who preserve their lives.\nLook at all the world’s fame-seekers—\nmired in dust, they wage endless war.\n\n**Another**\nThirty years under the true Master’s teaching,\nhow often he reproached my imperfections!\nSwiftly mending my ways in secret, I near old age,\nyet on the brink of death, I’m still not whole.\n\n**Two rooms obtained beneath Baoxuan Hall**\nTwo quiet chambers, one left empty,\na single mat for sleep—joy lies within.\nBlame me not for forgetting poverty, living as I please;\nit’s only that my mastery of the Dao remains imperfect.\n\n**Another**\nA warm room, bright windows—here I sleep,\nyet I recall the world’s lingering cold.\nWho passes the three winters in ease?\nMost fall to the sword, year after year.\n\n**Another**\nDwelling in quiet chambers, clarity grows clearer;\ncasually, I avoid worldly entanglements.\nThough outer demons assail a thousandfold,\nmy single true heart knows no fear.\n\n**Another**\nOriginally, a single spark, most solitary and numinous,\ntainted by human feelings, ten thousand affairs arise.\nTo return to the root, to purity,\none must revert to simplicity, enter perfect completion.\n\n**Another**\nWhen active, practice the Dao, study Perpetual Spring;\nwhen at rest, silently merge with the true.\nOnce the single nature is penetrated, there is no inside or out;\nboth states flow without near or far.\n\n**Another**\nWhy strive for clever lines? What is there to vie for?\nUnfettered, I chant wildly, writing as the brush moves.\nDelighting in my nature, I speak to gladden the Dao;\ninspired, I find contentment, seeking no fame.\n\n**For Lord Duan, who retrieved a small fish for release** (repeated for context)\nA slender scale begged for, spared the pot,\nreturned to the stream to roam at will.\nSay not that one day it may grow into a whale—\neven now, its leisure brings joy.\n\n**For a Chan Monk Who Presented a Painting of Ink Bamboo and Requested a Poem**\nThree stalks of Huangshan bamboo I’ve gathered,\nunfurled now for the Daoist’s gaze.\nLet the world’s fleeting hours rush past—\nit knows neither glory nor withering, nor the cold of years.\n\n**For a Daoist Friend Who Requested Tea**\nA crisp clarity arises, ever free and bright;\nthe demon of sleep is vanquished, coolness gained.\nAll that is wrought must end in rise and fall—\nonly the unburdened, natural state endures.\n\n**Ascending the Heights**\nAs white dew scatters, autumn’s depth grows keen,\ncrimson leaves drift down through the chill woods.\nAt the Pavilion of Yellow Blossoms, three joys arise—\nwine in hand, I sing aloud to dispel the mood.\n\n**Self-Reflection on the Love of Stillness**\nFrom the first, right discernment lies in man’s priority;\nseeing affairs, one seeks the wondrous mystery.\nOnly now do I know my past errors—\nwhen words and self are forgotten, nature is whole.\n\n**Another**\nOften I see indulgence invite calamity,\nyet never has the perfect Dao brought misfortune.\nHow have immortals through the ages attained their lot?\nAll from preserving the mind in stillness.\n\n**Hearing the Sound of a Lute by Moonlight in Baoxuan Hall**\nThe vastness of Yanshan stretches wide, the night deep and clear;\nseated, I hear the calls of passing geese, one or two.\nThe worldly toil ceaselessly, their hearts still bound—\nthe recluse sits in silence, his ears keenly attuned.\n\n**Another**\nAfter autumn, Baoxuan grows ever more serene;\nin the hush of night, the cries of geese resound.\nSitting in stillness, the sleep demon finds no hold—\nmoonlight and the heart’s aperture both luminous.\n\n**Viewing Cock’s-Comb Flowers**\nA riot of reds withers after ten days,\nyet the deep purple of late autumn still withstands the wind.\nDo not regard all idle blooms as one—\ntheir natures differ in what they endure.\n\n**For Academician Chen**\nDebates arise from varied views,\nyet none grasp the true reality.\nWorldly chatter cannot exhaust the depths—\ntranscendent discourse lies in the heart of things.\nWho understands that window companions remain as paper apart?\nOutside and within, two winds blow.\n\n**Responding to Five Poems Presented by Academician Wu**\nFortunate to be a man, grown in the Central Land,\nyou claim the highest immortal’s rank among your peers.\nFollow the ways of Master Pang and the Xu family—\nlift your whole household lightly, sparing them the barren mounds.\n\n**Another**\nContent in solitude, I dwell in quiet joy,\nspared the world’s hollow praise.\nWhen nature is still, the true teaching flows naturally—\nwith a heart at ease, why labor over books?\n\n**Another**\nCultivating the real, I seek no reliance on the natural;\nyear after year, I put it off until next.\nI wait only for the Dark Lord’s promised sign—\nwhere now to seek the immortals?\n\n**Another**\nWithout resolve, man cannot find leisure;\ndusk and dawn pass, temples turn silver.\nAll say the groves and springs nurture the Dao—\nhow many through the ages have reached their home mountain?\n\n**Composed at Tianchang Abbey**\nA fleeting name, lightly grasped, becomes a demon;\nhow much more so the tangled affairs of human feeling?\nClinging to appearances, wavering without decision—\nwhat end awaits such a path?\n\n**For Academician Chen, Who Requested a Poem on His Cap and Hairpin**\nI cherish meeting minds with open hearts,\nyet lightly bestow cap and pin.\nYour bones bear no trace of the common dust—\nwhen will you return to the groves?\n\n**For Director Liu of Yanjing, Who Renounced the World to Dwell at Yunfeng Abbey in the Western Hills**\nThe teaching flourishes in the northern wilds,\ndrawing thousands to the assembly.\nYou alone have savored its truth, awakened first—\ndwell in stillness on Western Mountain, turn back no more.\n\n**Another**\nIn Pengcheng, your karmic bond with the Dao runs deep;\nyou submitted your vow, knocking at the gate of mystery.\nNow you become master of Yunfeng—\nbefore reaching Penglai, you are already immortal.\n\n**Occasional Verse from Baoxuan Hall**\nSeeing through the emptiness of body and all dharmas,\nstill and unmoving, yet responsive when moved.\nThe true and constant meets the world without hindrance—\ndivine transformations reveal sacred power.\n\n**Another**\nDay after day, the sun rises east, sets west,\nfleeting clouds encroach on the brief light.\nSixty years have passed, old age approaches—\ntreasure each moment in the empty studio.\n\n**Seizing the Unenlightened Mind**\nDo not indulge the unenlightened mind’s fiery karma;\nwhere it arises, true nature lies.\nWhen touched, see through its wondrous subtlety—\nthen turn the unenlightened mind into your light.\n\n**Five Watches Hymn on Cultivation**\n\n**First Watch**\nAfter evening audience, the first watch begins,\nI gather my spirit’s radiance into the great void.\nNo worldly clamor disturbs my ears—\nin the stillness of nature, joy knows no end.\n\n**Second Watch**\nIn the second watch’s hush, true leisure is found,\nqi flows ceaselessly, coming and going.\nWhen the three fields are full, yin ghosts vanish;\nwith ninefold refinement complete, one joins the immortals’ ranks.\n\n**Third Watch**\nAt the third watch, the first yang stirs at the third point,\nthe six jia, three origins, and five qi grow pure.\nIf not for the root of nature transcending creation,\nhow could the treasure of life attain perfection?\n\n**Fourth Watch**\nBy the fourth watch, demons retreat, their troops dispersed;\nsound sleep brings peaceful rest, hailing great peace.\nIn dreams, all is clear, nothing clings—\nawakening, a lingering purity remains.\n\n**Fifth Watch**\nAt the fifth watch, the fifth point, the night wanes,\na will firm as steel, still as a mountain.\nDo not say immortals cannot be found—\neternal life lies in questioning the inch of heart.\n\n**Bidding Farewell to the Perfected One Before Journeying to Jinshan**\nThe great kalpa churns, still unsettled—\nI take leave of my master, my heart iron-hard.\nWhat can compare to the Daoist’s resolve?\nEven death, when it comes, is no easy matter.\n\n**On the Twenty-Fourth Day of the Eleventh Month, Jia-Shen Year, Taking Leave of My Master**\nWith several riders, we part from ancient Yanjing,\ncrossing the northern pass, my spirit unbound.\nLightly, I fulfill my lifelong wish—\non horseback, I chant idly, entering the grotto-heaven.\n\n**Another**\nA fair wind bears me to Jiashan,\nwhere I pillow on stone, sleep amid clouds, at ease.\nNo clamor of the dusty market reaches my ears—\nmy heart takes flight, recalling the western pass.\n\n**Another**\nIn the third ninth-day cold, snow blankets the mountains;\nthe east wind carries me past Yuguan.\nHuman feelings fade, heaven grants its favor—\nperhaps my future holds a share of leisure.\n\n**Composed at Qiuyang Abbey**\nI hear Qiuyang’s scenery is secluded,\nwhere immortals have trodden these cliffs.\nThe verses of Perpetual Spring are truly fit for painting—\ntheir fame spreads far, ceaselessly.\n\n**Another**\nNow I wander here at leisure,\nchanting poems, my mood unspent.\nRecalling the renowned guests of Tianchang—\nhow many have returned to these cliffs?\n\n**Another**\nI have crossed countless famous mountains,\nyet none compare to Qiuyang’s serene beauty.\nLast year, a true immortal passed this way—\nthis winter, a wandering guest arrives.\n\n**Spring Day**\nQiuyang lies far from the imperial domain,\nunaware of the Eastern Lord’s subtle workings.\n\nDo not marvel that spring arrives belatedly—\nthe balmy breeze reaches the cliffs in an instant.\n\n**Another**\nMy body drifts unmoored across the earth,\nlike tumbleweed or floating duckweed through the years.\nI ask not whether my hometown is safe or joyful—\nwherever karmic stillness dwells becomes my home.\n\n**Composed at Longyang Abbey on Pure Brightness Day**\nThings act yet remain unmoved by emotion,\nthe six senses at peace, naturally harmonious.\nThe Three Fields filled with qi, a thousand demons vanish;\na single point of light illumines the ten thousand dharmas.\n\n**Another**\nBeyond the world, my idle verses ring pure,\nclearing the heart, dispelling delusion.\nA wisdom wind scatters the clouds of confusion—\nrevealing the ever-bright moon as it was.\n\n**Snow in Late Spring at the Mountain’s Rear**\nSpring ends, cold clouds suddenly crack like thunder,\njade flakes of the northern peak pile into drifts.\nNo peach blossoms—gaudy, fleeting—are to be seen,\nonly pear flowers blooming on a few trees.\n\n**West of the Pass, with Envoy Hua Zongxuan Selecting a Site for an Abbey**\nA few riders glide beyond the pass,\nplaying in this grotto-heaven, hearts at ease.\nI seek no warmth from kin or worldly favor—\nonly that your Dao-eye may open wide.\n\n**Another**\nBeyond the pass, the dwelling is profoundly secluded,\nmountains deep, rivers distant, waters flowing long.\nNo need to wash my ears—my heart is ever still;\nwho would chase a name like Xu You’s?\n\n**After the Completion of Longyang Abbey: A Five-Mu Garden with an Ancient Pine**\nBeneath the old pine, hoeing melon vines by day,\nI rest and present this to my fellow Daoists.\nMy master’s blessings were too meager to share the dust;\nofferings proved too great, so I withdrew.\nI laugh at myself for failing to become a vessel of worth—\ncontent at Longyang to be a melon-tending man.\n\n**An Ancient Pine Behind Longyang Abbey**\nLongyang’s ancient pine is worthy of envy,\nits branches and leaves unchanged through winter’s turn.\nTall and solitary, it makes a fitting companion—\nhow unlike the fleeting glory of flowers and grasses.\n\n**From □yang East to Jinshan, Some Two Hundred Li: Local Produce Unmatched Elsewhere**\nHuailai’s jade nectar, Dexing’s blossoms—\nnot inferior to the Central Plains’ finest scenes.\nEven more, the idle man finds true delight:\na valley of hemp and wheat as his livelihood.\n\n**On the Double Fifth, with Daoist Companions from Dexing Prefecture Visiting Lingjing Temple on White Stele Mountain**\nSeeking liberation from the world’s dust,\nI ascend the western peak’s sixty winding turns.\nArriving at this grotto-heaven of pristine purity,\nmy heart finds sudden, profound peace.\n\n**Another**\nGray-haired and weathered, a student of the Dao,\nI wander mountains and rivers at leisure.\nIn youth, my disciples toiled diligently—\nnow in age, body and mind are free.\n\n**Nothing Real to Grasp—Nature Alone Suffices**\nI love to chant in the wind beneath the moon,\ntaking up and setting down without effort.\nI know my words are all empty forms—\nonly when meeting a kindred spirit do I find true appreciation.\n\n**Passing Through Wuchuan in Mid-Summer; Daoist Friends Invite Me to Stay for the Season**\nI reply: At Dragon Field in the seventh month,\nthe hall’s beams will be raised, and melons already ripe.\nThus I compose this verse.\n\nWherever karmic conditions lead is my livelihood;\nwhen merit fills the Three Thousands, flowers bear fruit.\nI once promised Longyang—\nthe ridgepole is set, and I’ve been promised fresh melon.\n\n**On the Strange Cypress Meditation Bench at the Residence of the Fifth Lady**\nThe cypress meditation bench befits the Daoist household;\nour meeting is truly a fine livelihood.\nAll day we sit together, wordless in discourse,\neach guarding purity to pass the years.\n\n**Firmly Declining Daoist Friends’ Invitation to Longyang**\nSummer at Wuchuan surpasses Longyang—\nin the sixth month, the windows catch the cool breeze.\nI fear leaving too soon, my work unfinished,\nunable to stay and taste the fine melons.\n\n**Retiring to a Mountain Cave—One Day, Pan Shi Bestows the Dharma Name \"Master of Pure Harmony\"**\nReturning the letter, I offer this poem in gratitude.\n\nI subdued my heart to study the Dao, escaping worldly demons,\nresolved to cultivate truth and ascend the Great Canopy.\nThirty years of effort yet unfulfilled—\nan empty title bestowed: \"Pure Harmony.\"\n\n**Another**\nOnce in Jade Clarity, I wore purple robes;\ntoday beneath the cliff, I refuse even silk.\nLet a thousand changes come—\nI preserve this tranquil harmony of qi.\n\n**Another**\n\n**Mastering the Self to Cultivate Truth, Fewer Demons to Confront**\nMastering the self to cultivate truth, demons diminish—\nfrom the first, one’s duty suffices to unfold the net.\nNow, in my decline, a master’s title is bestowed,\nshaming the immortal Zhang Zhihe.\n\n**Another**\nCoarse rice fills the belly, vanquishing demons;\ntattered robes cover the body, surpassing silk.\nFleeting fame and profit breed chaos in busyness—\ntrue conduct and merit thrive in stillness.\n\n**Admiring the Moon After Rain in the Mountains**\nRain clears on Western Mountain, the sky serene and bright,\na flawless mirror of jade hangs in the azure expanse.\nThe Daoist sits through the night in rapture,\nenchanted by that luminous, perfect orb.\n\n**Another**\nRain passes on Western Mountain, the moon at its brightest—\nmid-autumn’s shared delight stirs quiet feeling.\nIts cold light shatters the cowardice of demons,\nsleepless through the night, bone-deep clarity.\n\n**Another**\nMountains hushed, clouds withdrawn into night’s purity,\nmoonlight pierces the nine heavens with limpid radiance.\nIt illumines the heart’s core, leaving no room for doubt—\nonly the stirrings of poetry and the Dao remain.\n\n**Following the Rhyme of Duan Gong’s Poem**\nA thousand mountains traversed, then ten thousand more,\nyet nowhere offers a smile to greet the eye.\nOnly beyond the pass do mist and rosy clouds linger—\nthere, in the realm of emptiness and ethereal distance.\n\n**The Hall of Mystic Contemplation West of Baoxuan Hall**\nComposed in the rhyme of Duan Gong’s poem.\n\nAlone I sit in the dark palace of Mystic Contemplation,\nsilent, wordless, inwardly nurturing hidden light.\nOne day, when the primal nature is fully cultivated,\nit will shatter heaven and earth—nowhere left to hide.\n\n**Matching the Rhyme of the Worthies’ Red Stone Poems**\nRed stone, ground again and again, yields not to vermilion,\ndissolving doubts, it delights in true suchness.\nFor it unravels the hidden meanings of the grass-script classics—\na single insight unlocks ten thousand ancient texts.\n\n**Another**\nExquisite stone and refined gold both dwell in mountains,\nyet neither can replace this substance to rejuvenate the face.\nWhere the jade instructions reveal their clarity,\ndoubts vanish in an instant.\n\n**Lamenting the Futility of Empty Fame**\nYesterday, lowly in name, my heart knew no joy;\ntoday, burdened with renown—what good does it bring?\nPeople fail to grasp the sufficiency of the ordinary,\nvainly courting desire, piling up karmic debt.\n\n**On Past and Present**\nWhat became of the ancient Daoist wind of simplicity?\nNon-action, non-striving, naturally pure and harmonious.\nAlas for this degenerate age, where human feelings run deep—\nsowing boundless karmic demons in their wake.\n\n**Inscribed for One Seeking a Title for a Goshawk Painting**\nSpirit bright, swift, and fierce, it grazes the heavens,\nsubduing snares to preserve grand harmony.\nEver vigilant, never resting—\nhow could it let a single foe from Silla slip by?\n\n**Entering the Gorges, Visiting Tuanshan Daoist Abbey—Inscribed in Stay**\nThe surging river rolls a thousand li,\njumbled peaks layer upon layer, the gorge’s gates open wide.\nIts force bends and twists in endless turns,\nflowing eastward—how many journeys to return?\n\n**Another**\nThe two gorges rise in rugged majesty,\nTuanshan, bathed in water, a painted screen within.\nThis wondrous scene lies beyond the red dust—\ncould this be the first palace of Penglai?\n\n**Three Poems on Seeing Daoist Friends Off at Wuchuan to Fan Mountain County**\n\n**I**\nSince parting Wuchuan, I’ve returned to Yan,\nour reunion now seems fated by chance.\nAlready the jade halls urge haste—\nhow can I bear the coal dust billowing in smoke?\n\n**II**\nOnly for my master’s burial in ancient Yan\ndo I tarry, adapting to circumstances as they come.\nCultivating truth most fears harming harmony—\nnurturing nature, never let fire or smoke arise.\n\n**III**\nSnow-capped peaks gleam white, stretching south to Yan,\ncrossing mountains and rivers—my destined path.\n\n**One Day Attaining the Realm of Eternal Spring,**\nIncense fills the jade halls, weaving auspicious mist.\n\n**Ten Poems Composed in Leisure on the First Day of the Gengyin Year**\n\n**I**\nDiscoursing on the mysterious, debating the wondrous—words are pure,\nyet intent twists, the heart wanders, turning ever unclear.\nAll speak of benefiting others to fulfill perfect virtue—\nbut when has this ever cost oneself even half a deed?\n\n**II**\nThe kalpa’s decay lingers, qi not yet cleansed,\nheaven reveals all goodness, distinctions growing clear.\nAll beings universally transform, returning to the true teaching,\nthe myriad forms radiant, moving in harmony with the measure.\n\n**III**\nThe ten thousand sounds hush, the single qi clears,\nthe Three Yangs blaze, the Nine Lights shine bright.\nWorldly glory and splendor are not my desire—\nI cherish preserving the heart, walking in stillness.\n\n**IV**\nThe inch of heart never dimmed, qi ever pure,\nevery thought selfless, the Dao gradually illumined.\nTen years’ journey circling the Three Realms above,\nin one moment merit complete, traversing the Nine Heavens.\n\n**V**\nBeyond the world, idle chanting holds a different clarity,\nthe blade of wisdom honed sharp, the heart of Dao made bright.\nAmid a thousand blossoms, lying robed in repose,\nat the hundred-foot pole’s tip, advancing step by step.\n\n**VI**\nThe supreme Dao is level, the gaze far and clear,\nunobstructed in all directions, the four quarters bright.\nThe men of this age do not trust the path of true emptiness—\ncome, let us walk as companions with the idle ones.\n\n**VII**\nThe immortal palace’s purple courts hold lingering purity,\nthe Jasper Terrace of Lang Garden—my vision is clear.\nBefore the Six-Six Caves, riding the phoenix past,\nabove the Three-Three Heavens, treading the clouds.\n\n**VIII**\nThe sky, unobscured, shines resplendently clear,\nthe Sage Emperor and true kings—sun and moon bright.\nTogether we rejoice, our temples streaked with age beneath Shun’s reign,\nfreely roaming the land of Great Peace.\n\n**IX**\nThe scenery of Eternal Spring is naturally pure,\nthe Western Pavilion and Eastern Terrace—four vistas bright.\nFeathered guests and immortal officials pass in exchange—\ndisheveled topknots and parted hair come and go.\n\n**X**\nThe perfected immortals of the realized Dao stand pure through ten thousand ages,\ntheir teachings handed down to instruct the wise.\nThe superior person, content, sits in wordless absorption—\nall day, carefree, he wanders alone.\n\nIn the gengyin year, returning from the *jiao* rites at Tongxian Abbey,\nI take leave of Daoist friends, the Marshal and the Military Overseer with verse.\n\nLong weary of the world’s ways, I loved the mountains deeply,\nyet my share in the hills was meager—eastward I return.\nMy work incomplete, I follow fate’s turns,\nstill restless, never at ease.\n\n**XI**\nFor days I lingered, loath to leave the Western Mountains,\nyet letters summoned me back at once.\nI sigh—my temples streaked with age, the years grown old,\nwhile worldly ties still will not grant me leisure.\n\n**XII**\nA thousand *li* of mountains stretch in endless ranges,\nwhere for years I lingered, coming and going.\nNo path was too rugged when I set out,\nhoping to claim this peace for life.\n\n**XIII**\nIn Yan, they urged me to leave Mount Jia,\na few riders lightly turning east again.\nNot for the coldness of incense or white clouds,\nbut for the heart’s own freedom—pure and idle.\n\n**XIV**\nRange upon range, uncounted mountains,\nthe Daoist roams without thought of return.\nBefore mastering the wondrous subtleties of the Perfect Truth,\nwho attains the carefree ease of true leisure?\n\n**XV**\nFive quatrains newly composed to bid this mountain farewell—\nwhen will I return after parting?\nIf you can cast off both movement and stillness,\neverywhere you go, the mind is free—at last, at ease.\n\n**Taking Leave of the Daoist Assembly at River and Mountain**\nThe sound of water, the hues of mountains—void of feeling,\nyet between them, the spirit grows clear.\nNot for the weight of worldly ties here,\nbut to recall the joy of a lifetime upon return.\n\n**XVI**\nDelighting in the Dao, forgetting schemes—this is true nature,\nroaming hills and streams, the eyes grow bright.\nIn old age, no place of rest,\nonly endless wandering east and west, south and north.\n\n**XVII**\nThe Mystery Teachings dispel delusion, far from worldly cares,\nwhen worldly cares are wholly cut, the Daoist heart shines clear.\nSince first arriving, little has transpired—\nonly to probe the mystery of life and death.\n\n**Postscript to the *Ten Elders* Scroll**\nTen idle ones, idle and pure,\ntheir clarity of vision keen.\nI bid you sit in idleness—\nwhat skill is honed in leisure’s midst?\n\n**Staying at Xiantian Abbey in Fanshan for the Summer, Exhorting the Assembly**\nTo the southwest, war’s desolation still rages,\nwhile here in the northeast, summer months bring cool repose.\nIt is fitting to practice goodness here,\ncultivating virtue and burning incense of renown.\n\n**XVIII**\nThe great kalpa unfolds in chaos, desolation everywhere,\nyet by fortune, this place knows cool tranquility.\nI urge you to redouble efforts in cultivating true blessings—\ngradually, you will sense the fragrance of non-action and purity.\n\n**XIX**\nOnce I followed my late master through vast wastelands,\nreturning, I rejoiced in this cool refuge.\nWhile war’s clamor has not ceased, this land thrives first—\nfor its people are honest, their virtue fragrant.\n\n**XX**\nEach person, lost in delusion, wanders in desolation,\nhow can the heart find cool repose?\nPierce through the snares of the world, return beyond things—\nnaturally, virtue and the Dao will be fragrant.\n\n**XXI**\nRefining the nature, penetrating the true—no desolation,\nlet creation shift between heat and cold.\nWhen merit is complete, ride the crane to Penglai Isle,\nleaving behind a name fragrant through ten thousand ages.\n\n**Parting from Daoist Friends at Fanshan**\nBeyond things, carefree, far from worldly demons,\nnon-action, non-striving—preserving purity and harmony.\nI have come here many times, grown familiar with the ways of men,\nwhere reason is thoroughly explored, the good are many.\n\n**XXII**\nEmbracing the One, never straying, roaming beyond things,\nadrift alone, steering the great spirit-boat.\nIn the boundless sea of suffering, countless souls—\nwho will still their hearts and take the hook?\n\n**XXIII**\nSincere words urge an early turn,\nyet those who heed not sink into the Nine Dark Realms.\nThe Great Sage cannot lift them out—\nrecognize the truth now, swallow the hook.\n\n**On the Gushing Gold Pool Behind the Hall of Xiantian Abbey**\nA wooden plaque floats upon the pool’s surface,\nwarning all not to defile it.\nRolling, the sacred spring flows deep through the years—\nlet not a speck of filth intrude.\n\nThe world sees only boundless water,\nbut in my eyes, it is inexhaustible gold.\n\n**Passing by Ma’s Estate in Clearwater Village near Yantai, Delayed by Rain**\nThe wind from Fufeng stirred the heavens,\na night of clouds birthing ceaseless rain.\nAll things in the west reach fruition—there is trust in this,\nyet a thousand gold pieces cannot buy a single true friend.\n\n**Expressing My Feelings**\nYears of seeking the Dao—only now do I begin to succeed,\neach trial of demons brings renewal.\nWhen demons come often, the heart must not waver—\nonly when demons are exhausted does the single truth shine clear.\n\n**XXIV**\nThe Seven Perfected cultivated virtue, moving the heavens,\ntheir single act of mystic wind passed beyond the Jade Pass.\nThe *Shuidiao* song’s friends proved true,\nthrowing wide the gates, leaning upon Yan Mountain.\n\n**Three Quatrains on Journeying to the Offering at Guozhou**\nFor a year, I dwelled in the Pavilion of Constant Contentment,\nbody and mind at last somewhat at ease.\nThe Teachings’ call made me know the difficulty of escape—\nyet I did not shun the distant journey to the *jiao* feast.\n\n**XXV**\nNorth of the ridges, the wind is cold—an ancient truth,\nthrough three winters, I crossed the Yanmen Pass.\nThe Daoist’s compassion and kindness are a treasure,\ndelivering the dead, mourning the living—forming good karmic ties.\n\n**XXVI**\nBriefly parting from the Hall of Compliance in Yan City,\nI journeyed on my master’s behalf to other lands.\nNot that I sought to cling or stir up connections—\nbut the *jiao* host’s sincerity could not be forgotten.\n\n**Inscribing Ink Bamboo**\nThe Ink Lord paints the four seasons’ spring,\nleaf upon leaf, branch upon branch—far beyond the dust.\nSeizing creation’s power, wielding it in hand,\neach stroke brings forth something new.\n\n**Self-Description in the Pavilion of Constant Contentment**\nIn the Pavilion of Constant Contentment, mountains and seas are whole,\nwind and moon accompany the passing years.\nThose who seek to see me have no other words—\nall call this place the Little Grotto-Heaven of Everlasting Spring.\n\n**XXVII**\nThis small pavilion holds mountains and seas in full,\n\"Constant Contentment\" its name—ease in old age.\nWhere better to find idleness and freedom?\nWhere else to seek the Gourd Heaven?\n\n**Passing by Nanxin Village in Jin’an Prefecture, Presented to Daoist Du**\nAt six, he left home—ninety-one now,\nthe single truth shining through four, three, seven.\nToday, by good fortune, deep karmic ties meet—\nall dharmas forgotten, all affairs complete.\n\n**Occasional Verses**\nGathering up the fishing rod, the hook laid aside,\nall ties suddenly stilled—rest, rest.\nPassions forgotten, intentions extinguished—little remains,\nthe other shore ascended high, no boat needed.\n\n**XXVIII**\nNot deceived by fragrant bait, not swallowing the hook,\nthus attaining ease—all affairs at rest.\nRain hat and misty cloak ever companions,\nthe clear river calmly bears a solitary boat.\n\n**XXIX**\nBest to cast all ties aside with a single stroke,\ncultivating the true must cease before death.\nThe vast sea of suffering—waves surge fiercely,\nreturn, come—ah!—the boat to the shore.\n\n**Exhortation to the Assembly**\nIn Tu River, through nine summers, sitting in cool clarity,\nin Suiyi, through three winters, sleeping at ease.\n\nOnly ever cherishing the thought of the Dao,\ncloud-wandering wherever I go, I find peace.\n\n**Again**\nDo not fret that years pass and merit remains incomplete—\none morning, when practice is fulfilled, sleep will be forgotten.\nCultivating the true is no ordinary matter:\none must recognize what is so within the so, what is not so within the not-so.\n\n**Again**\nA universal exhortation to the wise and later learners of immortality:\ndo not indulge in cravings or give free rein to slumber.\nAt all times, inquire into the Dao and virtue,\nand you will realize the primordial, in accord with nature.\n\n**Matching the Rhyme of Layman Heji Tong**\nThe fruits of cultivating the true are like a shuttle’s swift motion—\nnot empty words, yet just so.\nIn the place of sudden awakening and tranquil communion, free from desire,\nthe message within naturally harmonizes.\n\n**Composed at Tongxian Abbey, Sent to Master Feng and His Circle in Yanshan**\nA stretch of Western Mountains all belongs to Yan,\nand Yanshan is fit for passing one’s remaining years.\nOur gate’s disciples are inherently cultivators of the true—\ncome to these mountains, and you are immortals.\n\n**Again**\nNeither fragrant bait nor hook,\nonly an idle fishing rod set beside the boat.\nEyes meet in silence, knowing this meaning—\nwhy labor the mouth to urge fellow travelers?\n\n**Presented to Shi Dian on His Trial**\nI have a desire for leisure to bestow upon others,\nyet none possess the capacity to fully embrace the true.\nOne who holds jade within stone may yet preserve it—\nbeyond the world’s cares, a different spring unfolds.\n\n**Passing Gaojiapu**\nWithin the heart of great mountains, a small hermitage—\npassing through, how could I have stayed even a day?\nYet I love this grotto-heaven where none come,\nand lingered far longer than intended.\n\n**Again**\n\nIn twos and threes, small children\nalso know to raise their fists in proper courtesy.\nWherever good affinities align with heaven’s will,\nthe age of Great Peace lies not far ahead.\n\n**Again**\nOnly in stillness do I glimpse the divine child—\nI ask the passing traveler: when will you know?\nWhen merits fill three thousand, the meeting comes;\nwhen the Eight Hundred Paths are complete, the auspicious hour arrives.\n\n**Passing Hunyuan’s Luanling Pass**\nOn the first day of winter’s depths, I left Fan Mountain;\nin the third nine-day cold, I crossed Luanling Pass.\nThe gathered crowd sent me off with many sighs—\neven a Daoist finds hardship here, yet smiles.\n\n**Again**\nThe year has aged as I traverse the western mountains,\npassing one barrier only to face another.\nThe cold clings to my beard, revealing my true age,\nwhile the northern wind on my face keeps it youthful.\n\n**Again**\nIn the frozen severity of nine nines, snow blankets the peaks,\njust as when Han Yu crossed Lan Pass.\nThis procession of Daoists would make a fine painting—\nsnowy temples, frosted whiskers, faces grown old.\n\n**Two Quatrains on the Small Pavilion at Yue Shen Mountain**\nBefore the ten-thousand-fathom peak stands a small pavilion,\nwhere one may lie or sit with all clearly in view.\nThe great Dao before one’s eyes is hard to perceive—\nyet all day long, carefree joy is mine.\n\n**Again**\nBefore the ten-thousand-fathom peak, a thatched hut—\nall day, its delights make sitting alone sweet.\nIf someone comes to speak of worldly affairs,\nI close my eyes and remain silent until evening meditation.\n\n**Composed on New Year’s Day in Huairen County**\nLast year in Chongyi, the new year began;\ntoday in Huairen, the old year is renewed.\nAfter twelve more cycles of the celestial sphere,\nwhere shall we gather again to celebrate the first month?\n\n**Matching the Rhyme of Secretary Yilie Chen Xiuyu at Zihe Guan in Nanyang Village, Zhangzhou**\nThe Three Teachings share the same source, yet people differ—\nif you say west is right, then east must be wrong.\nBefore your eyes lies the clear distinction—\nonce the One True is realized, the Non-Dual Palace is penetrated.\n\n**Accepting an Invitation to Feast at Chongzhen Guan with Preceptor Liu**\nFirst passing Yamen at the edge of the earth,\nthen nearing the Hu River’s end of the sky.\nNow this land is once more the Central Plain—\nwhen the four seas are harmonious, all is one family.\n\n**Three Quatrains on Xiuye Garden in Jiaocheng County, Composed in Late Spring of the Yiwei Year to Expand Its Refinement**\nXiuye’s new city endured chaos and separation,\nyet Master Qin’s fine deeds were truly extraordinary.\nThe garden’s flowers and trees are all uncommon,\nand the children at home all compose poetry.\n\n**Again**\nIn late spring, Xiuye is at its finest—\nbeneath the mulberry, enchanting reds are uniquely splendid.\nWho can grasp both without bias?\nThe subtle message of perfect clarity is known by few.\n\n**Again**\nStrolling through Xiuye, I pass a sparse fence—\nwhat meets the eye is pitiably fine, like brocade trees.\nIf you understand Old Wang’s intent east of the village,\nthen sir, do not compose poems about a hundred flowers.\n\n**Upon Visiting Qingxu Guan in Pingyao County**\nAlways seeking simplicity, I long for deep mountains,\nyet here I find Qingxu and a carefree old face.\nAncient cypresses stand quietly as

Passage for Travelers and Establish a Guan to Accumulate Merit—Responding with a Poem**\nMountains stretch a thousand *li* north and south;\nyou stand at a vital crossroads between Li and She.\nFortunate to wield authority, you should be accommodating—\nguide travelers through perilous passes.\n\n**Presented to the Boy Zhanbao**\nWith unkempt hair, he steadfastly cultivates the Dao,\na

Fields.\n\n**Declining an Invitation from Prefectural Vice-Director Zhang of Xinzhou—Responding with a Poem**\nFrom Pingyao I briefly parted to reach Pingyang,\na single body rushing about in several places.\nI constantly regret my incomplete merits, lacking transformation—\nunable to universally respond to all directions.\n\n**Composed at Hongshan’s Mingxia Guan in Jiexiu County in Late Autumn of the Yiwei Year**\nHongshan’s fine scenery, a secluded grotto-heaven,\nrests above clear cliffs where waterfalls flow.\nClimbing three or four *li* higher,\nI stroll idly to the spring’s source when the mood strikes.\n\n**Staying Overnight in a Earthen Cave at Lingyuan Guan in Yichang Village, Fenzhou**\nA winding earthen cave offers refuge from misfortune;\nin winter’s cold, I sleep late into the day.\nSometimes bandits come seeking me,\nbut I retreat deeper into the cave and do not emerge.\n\n**Traveling the Roads of Taiyuan and Pingyang, Where Welcomes and Farewells Never Cease**\nSpring and autumn pass on both routes as I respond to affinities—\nwelcomed on arrival, sent off on departure, never resting.\nHuman hearts do not yield like the waters of Fenyang—\nthey accompany me southwest to the very end.\n\n**On Laojun Peak of Zijin Mountain in Hejin**\nI come to record my journey in person—\ngazing in all directions, this is a strategic pass.\nThe immortal realm’s purity and loftiness are renowned since antiquity—\nto this day, it is called Laojun Peak.\n\n**Passing Hejin Where the Local Gentry Request a Poem**\nVast waves encircle the mountains on three sides;\nat their center, the ferry city stands between Yu and Ji.\nAs the Dao passes through, invitations arrive swiftly—\nthe entire plain’s incense fires light up with joy.\n\n**Conversing Idly with Zhang of Xiyan**\nAsk not of forests and springs, nor of mountains—\nall clarity and emptiness reside within a single heart.\nIf you can constantly distance yourself from worldly concerns,\nthen distancing yourself fully is true leisure.\n\n**Inscribed at the Hut in Xinzhang Village**\nWith a light body, why fear the ends of the earth?\nWith a tranquil nature, why worry about distant corners?\nReturning from Jingzhao in mid-summer,\nI find joy in this pure hut as the sun inclines.\n\n**Responding to Yang Hanqing**\nThe azure firmament has a path that can indeed be climbed—\nto know true leisure is no ordinary matter.\nGrinding away emotions and nature to transcend the Four Appearances,\nharmonizing the true breath to penetrate the Three Passes.\n\n**Inscribed at Guanyin Pavilion in Magu Valley**\nArriving at Magu Valley in late autumn,\na stream of clouds and water marks a fine journey’s start.\nOthers do not understand my joy—\nafter the meal, I ascend the pavilion at leisure alone.\n\n**Composing the Method of Peace and Ease for the Confucian Scholar Guo Gong**\nA single point of vastness must be square and round—\nnurture it directly, without self-interest, to fill the great thousand.\nTransforming and coming and going beyond the Three Realms,\nwhy worry that at sixty you cannot prolong your years?\n\n**Climbing the High Mountain Ahead**\nThe ends of the earth lie before me—\nthis high peak ahead could be painted and passed down.\nIf someone asks my name,\nI am but one of countless immortals among the pines.\n\n**Upon Gaining the High Mountain Ahead, Written at the Request of the Gathered Officials and Sent to Them**\nNow I have gained the high peak west of Guo—\nthe dense pines and cliffs are beyond counting.\nFrom youth, I always admired the joy of mountain life;\nin old age, this leisurely dwelling is most fitting.\n\n**Three Poems on Retirement Sent to Daoist Companions in Yanshan**\nThe heart retires, and years have passed accordingly—\nnow both heart and body are fully retired.\n\nProfound and wondrous, beyond all discourse,\npure and clear, in perfect accord with nature.\n\n**Again**\nFollowing the teachings and practicing causes for decades,\nthe abbeys of Yanshan are now nearly complete.\nTwice summoned to Zhongnan—all by heaven’s will—\nreturning now, all affairs are settled.\n\n**Again**\nThirty years of studying the Dao under masters,\nyet my merit remains incomplete, still imperfect.\nThrough a thousand perils on the world’s stormy paths,\nwho understands the serenity within my heart?\n\n**Admonition to the Assembly**\nThe wind in the pines enters the ear, dullness fades;\nworldly affairs weigh on the mind, turbidity and chaos multiply.\nFortunate to encounter this pure and secluded grotto-heaven,\nI urge you: do not indulge the demon of slumber.\n\n**Again**\nAsk not whether cultivation is shallow or deep—\nthe Daoist’s shadow is the Daoist’s heart.\nSince you already discern the principles so clearly,\nhow lamentable to waste time in reckless frivolity.\n\n**Sent to Horse Steward Ma of Pingyao County**\nOld Master Ma, recognizing what lies ahead,\nhas seen through the world—now it is time to rest.\nTurn instead to long-term plans in Tai Ping,\npassing spring and autumn with leisurely companions.\n\n**A Quatrain Composed for the Attendant Holding the Baton at Changchun Abbey, Whose Horse Was Halted by Snow at the Foot of the High Mountain Ahead**\nIn the profound clarity of the void, no words are set forth,\nyet one’s bearing should remain impartial.\nFrom a thousand miles away you came to visit,\nbut snow blocks the mountain gate—your horse cannot advance.\n\n**Inscribed During Days of Snow Play at the High Mountain Ahead**\nThe snow falls ceaselessly, misty and dense,\neven the green pines and cypresses seem burdened with sorrow.\nFurther troubled by urgent letters arriving from the east,\novernight, the green mountains have turned entirely white.\n\n**Three Quatrains Composed While Resting at Tortoise Mountain in Qincheng**\nAt Tongchuan, I already found cause to smile—\nthe whole prefecture’s people find respite among mountains and waters.\nYet there are still more refined and delightful places to admire;\nwhen the mood strikes, I stroll leisurely up Tortoise Mountain.\n\n**Again**\nFrom Tortoise Mountain’s heights, the four directions lie clear,\nseeing through the world’s affairs brings joy to the heart.\nFortunate now to have found this cool and refreshing place,\nI only wish all regions might soon know great peace.\n\n**Again**\nEach time I ascend Tortoise Mountain and gaze in all directions,\nwhere in the four quarters is there no desolation?\nFrom now on, awakened to the world of mortals,\neven in the scorching heat, my heart remains cool.\n\n**In Leisure**\nThe body’s nature is empty and mysterious, responsive where it connects;\nwhen it can respond, it becomes luminous and clear.\nNurturing luminosity reveals the wondrous within the void—\nthe wondrous body is true emptiness, yet not empty.\n\n**Again**\nTo cultivate the real, one must grasp the lineage of ancestors;\nthe ancestors manifest their sacred power at all times.\nIf you ask where the ancestors reside,\nthey are in the luminous and articulate nature.\n\n**Again**\nIn silent realization, recognize the ancestors—\nthe fine traditions of Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma.\nDisciples of this lineage, heed my counsel:\nexert yourselves diligently in cultivation to the very end.\n\n**Mid-Autumn of the Ding-You Year, Sent to the

even a thread remain.\n\n**Parting from Wine Officer Li of Pingyao County on the Double Fifth Festival**\nMy body, serene and free, comes and goes as it pleases,\nthough the world’s俗人 may harbor

those who come and go on their travels:\nhow many mountain abbeys are as complete as this?\n\n**Again**\nAt Five-Flower, all who see it break into smiles—\nwalking the level path, one finds it is already a mountain.\nThe abbey’s purity and seclusion are a realm of immortals;\nin the stillness of forests and springs, it surpasses the human world.\n\n**Again**\nAbove the Jade Lotus Pond stands the Jade Lotus Pavilion,\nfacing the water, overlooking the mountain, the view is clear.\nHaving wandered through the world, my plans for return come late—\nFive-Flower Mountain is fitting to spend my remaining years.\n\n**Five Quatrains on Visiting Five-Flower Mountain, in Reply to Wang Zizheng**\nFollowing the master’s summons, I rose from Weila,\nthe teachings unfolded step by step in Yanshan.\nWhere once I refined elixirs and cultivated the self,\ntoday, a leisurely visitor, I have returned again.\n\n**Again**\nStem by stem, green lotuses emerge from the square pond,\njust lacking Tao Yuanming’s golden chrysanthemum hedge.\nIn the height of summer, the fragrance of cultivation gradually unfolds—\nwaiting for the Double Ninth is not too late.\n\n**Again**\nFive-Flower has transformed again, like a Penglai palace,\na scene of pure coolness filling the eye.\nHeaven has granted this old body leisure and ease—\nby Five-Flower Pond, what a joyous wind!\n\n**Again**\nWho has mastered the inner cloud-wandering,\nroaming the eight directions without a care?\nIn this realm of purity and stillness lies an inexhaustible treasury—\nI ask you: where is the end of the journey?\n\n**Again**\nHaving exhausted human sentiments, one sees the sentiment of the Dao,\nyet the sentiment of the Dao is still a forced name.\nIf one can awaken to the wondrousness of no birth,\nthey will transcend Nan Hua and Chi Cheng.\n\n**Five-Character Regulated Verse**\n**In Praise of the Scripture of Purity and Stillness**\nThe three powers, pure and still in principle,\nthose who know awaken to true feeling.\nSupreme virtue is fundamentally without self;\nthe ignorant fundamentally delight in contention.\nSerene, it leaves behind what it illuminates;\nin responding to things, it becomes ever clearer.\nHow does one enter the utmost wondrousness?\nIn utter constancy, the nature is naturally at peace.\n\n**On the Insufficiency of Precepts**\nWith clothes, one can ward off the cold;\nwith food, one can fill the stomach.\nIf either of these two is lacking,\na person’s heart and mind will be askew.\n\nJust as when clothing and food are sufficient,\none still indulges in greed and delusion.\nSuddenly, when karmic deeds reach their fullness,\nat the brink of danger, whom else can one blame?\n\n**Composed in the Hall of Accord on an Autumn Mid-Autumn Night**\nIn the Hall of Accord, the mid-autumn stillness,\ncloud companions add to the harmonious qi.\nDemon spirits lurk at the sea’s edge,\nwhile the bright moon emerges from the mountain’s peak.\nAll nations share in joyful admiration,\na thousand gates together gaze in delight.\nSitting through the night in mutual regard,\nall feel their natures at peace and serene.\n\n**Composed at the Precelestial Abbey on Mount Fan**\nArriving first, there was still intent,\nbut clouds and waters were already without mind.\nHiding one’s traces only seeks remoteness,\nburying one’s name still feels insufficiently deep.\nAutumn’s sun bids farewell to dear friends,\nspring’s warmth seeks out kindred spirits.\nLonging for the stillness of Western Mountain,\nto spare oneself the intrusion of worldly affairs.\n\n**Further Verse**\nAbiding in the Dao, one forgets worldly burdens,\ndwelling in peace, one admires virtuous neighbors.\nAmong those seated, no vulgar guests,\non the mat, only lofty

congee thins—\ntwo flavors I’ve always favored,\none truth brings eternal peace.\nAfter eating, the four elements harmonize;\nwhen sated, the six spirits leap with joy.\nIn old age, such simple pleasures suffice—\nworldly affairs fade entirely away.\n\n**Recorded Sayings**\n*Instructions to Disciples by the Heavenly Perfected Daoist*\n\nThe teaching of the Perfect Realization (Quanzhen) school centers on the subtleties of nature, life, and virtue. Yet most scholars today fail to investigate their unity. For thirty years, I received oral transmissions and heart-to-heart teachings from the realized masters Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma—countless profound words on daily transgressions and blessings. Though I grasp the principles, my true practice and conduct often fall short, making it difficult to transcend the mundane and enter sagehood.\n\nNow, Lord Longxi, who has long been devoted to the Dao, has unexpectedly joined us. He earnestly seeks the subtle teachings I received from my masters, wishing to apply them himself and instruct later learners. Reluctantly, I set down a few points.\n\nThe Dao is never far from humanity—it is people who distance themselves from it. Many recognize that the Dao, Buddha-nature, and life are one, yet differences abound. They do not realize that practice inherently possesses wondrous nature, entirely free from attachment. Wisdom and life support each other, aiding the true stability of one’s nature, entering the unobstructed Dharma gate, merging into true oneness, forever transcending birth and death. Attaining spiritual freedom and self-mastery, one sees immediate proof—this is the wondrous Dao.\n\nIf a practitioner’s resolve is firm yet enlightenment remains elusive, it is due to past deficiencies in merit. Those who remain single-minded to the point of death and rebirth will emerge as enlightened beings. The sages will not overlook them; a gentle nudge opens the heart, and the Dao becomes effortless.\n\nThe master said: To understand the myriad dharmas, one must also not cling to them. Free from clinging, all dharmas are empty in form. Clinging to dharmas is grasping at the finger; not clinging is knowing where the finger points. Knowing where it points, one sees that all dharmas are empty. With this clarity, one becomes unbound and free, a person of few words who preserves life.\n\nFurther, acting upon the world with transformative power—decisive, bold, unstained, unattached—inner and outer merge in harmony. Accumulating merit and cultivating conduct day and night, even if one does not ascend in flight, one becomes extraordinary, a person of insight and courage, meeting all things with no-mind. Those quick-witted with eloquent speech may not grasp this; they are difficult to guide.\n\nTo advance on the path, one must not waste time before death—every moment is precious. As a Dao seeker, you must penetrate to the ultimate reality. Do not neglect the teachings of masters and friends. Even if you are enlightened, refine your practice through mutual inquiry until results appear. Only then can you stand alone without change and traverse all without exhaustion.\n\nHere, I briefly record these matters—subtle teachings imparted to me by realized masters. I humbly hope that those of shared aspiration will practice together and cross to the other shore.\n\n**Direct Words**\n*Addressed to the Daoist Community of Chongyang Abbey and Youde Abbey*\n\nThe karmic affinity with this ancestral court is no small matter—it differs from other places. This is where heaven permits the assembly of sages to propagate the teachings, the foundational site of our school. Those within its fold must revive and rebuild it with true practice, sincere devotion, and unwavering resolve when faced with demonic obstacles.\n\nOnly through single-minded accumulation of merit and conduct can this land be purified. Daoists who grasp this truth find that one unit of merit here equals ten elsewhere—so too with all endeavors. If the merit is great, it need not be known by me; may the assembled sages recognize it. If the sages truly send me to inspect your progress, your earnest requests will bring me. But if merit is scarce and transgressions many, calamity will strike—no small matter.\n\nNow, I return with these truthful words to announce to the Daoist communities of Chongyang Abbey and Youde Abbey. Let all take heed. I earnestly hope that those with Daoist aspirations will carefully consider these words—they deeply benefit you. Do not doubt; proceed with sincerity and begin at once. Do not delay. The perfected ones will never fail you.\n\n**Seven-Character Quatrain**\n*As Chongyang Festival Nears, Yuan the Perfected Gathers at Five Flowers Abbey—A Poem for Him*\n\nThough Five Flowers blooms

and rare fruits perfume the air.\nWhen worldly visitors arrive, they find cool serenity—\nraising their hands, they cannot but gaze in awe.\n\n**V**\nI love Autumn Yang’s weather,\nwhere a single finger points the cloud-path clear.\nWhy seek Cao Xi beyond the body?\nHere the three bodies and four wisdoms are fully seen.\n\nAsk not of heaven’s profound mysteries,\nnor chase the effortless Great Dao.\n\n**Before one’s eyes, recognizing these few things—**\nthis is the true lineage of the Quanzhen.\n\n**At Longyang Abbey on the Winter Solstice**\nThe moon’s radiance illumines the four

bodies merge with the void.\nWisdom pierces the numinous treasure, returning to the primordial—\nwho comprehends that none are saved without the teachings?\n\n**III**\nTo advance in the Dao, rely on steadfast resolve;\nguard the heart, never wander recklessly.\nHear my earnest counsel, fellow seekers—\ndo not wait until your hair turns white with procrastination.\n\nGreen locks and rosy cheeks

restored,\nwhile south of Yan, war still rages.\nThe Daoist’s merit and conduct have long accumulated—\nspared from misfortune and harm.\n\nEach day, recite scriptures to bless the realm;\nthroughout the morning, chant the Dao to subdue demons.\nFortune arises, calamity vanishes—nurturing harmony,\ntruly still, truly pure, attaining the fruit.\n\n**Returning to the Mountains**\nWritten in Tianchang during the height of summer,\nreturning to the mountains just as autumn arrives.\n\nFor nine summers, Tianchang’s heat was oppressive;\nbehind the mountains, autumn brings coolness.\nA valley of ripening millet stretches green—\nthe western harvest is in sight.\n\nNo matter how distant the ends of the earth,\nor how desolate the lands beyond the passes,\nif all is well before your eyes, it is an immortal realm—\nlet your heart follow conditions and be at ease.\n\n**II**\nDo not envy the clamor of the capital’s markets,\nnor shun the simplicity of a mountain home.\nThe cries of apes and cranes only deepen one’s joy—\na heart at peace is priceless.\n\nBy night, companions are the pure wind and bright moon;\nat dawn, one gazes upon green pines and rosy clouds.\nWith disheveled hair and a topknot, this is my life—\nworthy of being painted on a secluded screen.\n\n**III**\nBeyond the window, mountains stretch like a painting;\nbefore the gate, flowing water is fit to

becomes aware of ignorance.\nWhen ignorance is extinguished and worldly passions cease—\nthis is recognizing the mind and seeing the nature.\n\n**The Path into West Mountain**\nStone steps and cloud ladders—treacherous paths,\ngrasping vines and creepers—difficult to traverse.\nDeep within the cave-heaven, water and mountains gleam—\nfar removed from the dusty world’s sights and sounds.\n\nIn an earthen cave, sleep is peaceful, sitting is steady;\namid pine cliffs, the ears are quiet, the heart is clear.\nNo need to envy Xu You’s fame—\nthis is transcending the ordinary and entering the

man.\n\n**Exhorting the Assembly to Reduce Sleep**\nIn summer, diligently cultivate the precious hall;\nin winter, refine the stubborn heart.\nAt the third watch, do not yield to the sleep demon—\nthis is the master’s precept.\n\nStudy the Dao, do not be deluded by false thoughts;\ncultivate the truth, do not lose the monastic community.\nWhen the merit of non-action is complete, freely

Day**\n\nWhite wine eases the heart,\nyellow blossoms burst with fragrance.\nSuch true delight marks the Double Ninth—\nthe moon of the mind finds its perfect round.\nBeyond the mountains, three autumns pass without change,\nwhile hidden railings frame clusters of full bloom.\nTwo pavilions, each adorned with fresh blossoms,\nsurpass even the celestial groves of the grotto-heavens.\n\n**Exhortation to the World**\n\nThe Dao reveals the wondrous subtlety of clarity and void,\nwhile Buddhism illumines the depths of wisdom.\nConfucius’ benevolence and righteousness endure through ages—\nthe three sages share a single heart.\nYet those who fail to recognize silent enlightenment,\nwho only divide gates and households,\nwill one day close their eyes to see the path ahead,\nand regret their failure to achieve completion.\n\n**[Divining a Dwelling]**\n\nDivining a dwelling west of the pass,\nwhere ten thousand layered peaks rise,\nand the river winds through them,\ncurving up and down for twenty or thirty li.\nMuddy waves surge, mulberry and hemp gleam in the sun,\nthe people are kind, the land remote—\na fitting plan for one’s final years.\nI style myself the Hermitage of Aging,\nand send this short verse to mark it:\n\nTen thousand layered peaks stretch in emerald,\na thousand bends trace the winding path.\nThe villagers dwell content in soil and sericulture,\nflowing waters carry fragrant fallen blossoms.\nHere I settle to age in peace,\nletting form wither and heart grow withered.\nUnmoving, I spend my remaining years—\nwhere else might one seek immortals?\n\n**Inscribed at Tongxian Abbey**\n\nRows of verdant peaks stand graceful,\nthe immortal capital’s aura is pure.\nThe Three Yangs align in the jade turtle’s form,\na single qi shaped by heaven itself.\nAmid ten thousand layered clouds and mountains,\nlies a grotto-heaven’s secluded garden.\nWho could dwell here long in leisure,\nfinding boundless joy in stillness?\n\n**Urging the Making of a Quilted Robe**\n\nLast night the west wind blew fierce,\nthis morning autumn’s chill runs deep.\nThough the Daoist has subdued the heart,\ncold and heat remain hard to endure.\nThe quilted robe should be made ample,\nto drape by day and cover by night.\nEven this single garment may not suffice—\nwhere else might one seek refuge?\n\n**At Longmen Creek, Sharing Moon-viewing with Elder Zhai**\n\nThe creek’s waters greet the frost with chill,\nmountain blossoms bear dew’s freshness.\nGood friends together admire the jade toad’s round,\na grand gathering with boundless delight.\nI still recall the thousand li of West Lake,\nwhere the pale orb shone clear and whole.\nTonight, three years have passed since then—\nit all seems like a dream of wandering immortals.\n\n**For the Lady of Dragon-Tiger**\n\nThe merit of the Northern Sea remains unfulfilled,\nyet the journey to Red City is complete.\nA body in pure stillness forever forgets sorrow—\nwhere might idle cares arise?\nAt forty, one stands beyond doubt,\nunderstanding all things with clarity.\nRejoicing in heaven’s decree, preserving peace and harmony,\nthe true principle was never much at all.\n\n**Composed on Clear Water**\n\nThe true teaching unfolds in accord with the times,\nrevealing the precious altar as the moment demands.\nThe host of Perfected descend to leave traces among men,\nyet still they await their place among the ranks of immortals.\nCountless beings are transformed and delivered,\neach one guided to awakening.\nWhen merit is complete and the Way fulfilled,\nthey ascend Penglai, spared the three calamities of the kalpa.\n\n**Self-Reflection**\n\nThe lands south of Yan are damp and hot,\nwhile beyond the mountains lies a cool, clear sky.\nYin and yang are hard to fathom, topsy-turvy,\nold karmic bonds entangle of their own accord.\nFor two years I’ve endured the journey’s scorching heat,\nsilent all day, without speech.\nIn leisure, my merit and practice remain incomplete—\nthis only steels my resolve.\n\n**Warning Against Ignorance**\n\nA single point of radiant light,\nyet three thousand karmic obstacles run deep.\nI urge you to search carefully while there’s time—\ndo not wait for disaster to strike.\nTurn yourself wherever you go,\nfor wisdom’s nature can generate expedient means.\nIf you grasp these subtle truths,\nyou hold the ladder to heaven itself.\n\n**Phoenix Perches on the Wutong: Eleven Poems**\n*Composed at Autumn Sun Abbey*\n\nThe true teaching has spread for a thousand ages,\nyet in this fleeting world, how many awaken in their hearts?\nSuddenly roused, they seek the path out of samsara—\nturning the head, they find the ferry of the true immortals.\nWith merit complete and the Way fulfilled, they depart for Penglai,\naccompanied by Ever-Spring, carefree and without thought.\nThere are myriad wondrous blossoms beyond number—\nwho among those not freed from the dust can see them?\n\n**Again**\n\nWorldly affairs stretch endlessly—\nwhen will they ever end?\n\nHow could one compare to those who forget worldly schemes,\nlearning from me to return early to the mountains?\nBeneath the peaks, amidst the woods, I often laugh alone—\nwho among the unenlightened can ever reach this place?\nAll day in wordless silence, one moves quietly.\n\nDusk departs, dawn arrives,\nyet never a moment of idle vexation.\nCherish the true yang treasure within the body,\nno need for elixirs to keep the countenance fair.\n\n**Again**\n\nI know not how to inquire into Chan or meditation,\nbut wander idly through the world,\nonly keeping the mind unobscured.\nTrampling the void to shatter the six pairs,\nbeneath the pines on the crags, I sleep fully clothed in one long slumber.\n\nWhy boast of quick wit before others?\nA single spark of numinous clarity\npermits no dust to veil it.\nThe nature of the Dharma shines resplendent—observe the self at ease,\nreturning to the root, restoring life, transcending the three realms.\n\n**In Response to the Invitation from Xuande Prefecture**\n\nBeyond the mountains, I have traversed all three yangs.\nAt Xuande, facing the primal origin—\nwe must meet before it is too late.\nFor years, worldly affairs at the master’s side have wearied me,\nand I drift alone, blown by the wind.\n\nHow many times have I vowed beneath the boundless sky?\nCoarse food and rough robes,\ncutting off all human ties.\nWealth, honor, and glory hold no allure—\nbetter to perfect cultivation beneath the cliffs.\n\n**Again**\n\nSpring’s light on the crags nears its twilight.\n\nAlas, the spring’s radiance—\nno means to detain its fleeting grace.\nSpring departs, autumn arrives, the four seasons divide,\neach coming and going forging cold and heat.\nThe reckoning of years deceives, yet none awaken.\nGain and loss, sorrow and joy—\nall are but the turns of the wheel of rebirth.\nI would leave words of caution and exhortation,\nyet the human heart remains unenlightened, with no path to the Unborn.\n\n**Composed at the Temple of Primordial Dao**\n\nWhere lies the finest vista beyond the mountains?\nIn Shanggu’s numinous traces—\nsince ancient times, the Temple of the Yellow Emperor.\nFountains of pure streams coil and meander,\nwhile emerald cypresses stand in countless ranks.\nToday, I arrive in leisurely cloud-and-water wandering.\nWith unbridled brush, I chant wildly,\nlaughing freely to open my heart.\nTen thousand scenes cannot assail a mind aligned with the Dao—\nthe wondrous body of the Perfected True is perfectly luminous and complete.\n\n**Matching the Verse of the Green Void Altar**\n\nWhere to fathom the profound subtlety of the Supreme Dao?\nDeluded thoughts and perverse reflections—\nthese are the demons and beasts of the mind.\nTo cultivate the three fields and nurture flourishing sprouts,\nembrace true constancy, true stillness, true imperishability.\nThe five qi converge at the origin, the true One resounds.\nA thousand words, ten thousand phrases—\none must await the dissolution of the six yin.\nFrom ancient times to now, the deluded fail to perceive:\nvainly do they transmute the wondrous into festering sores.\n\n**Again**\n\nTurn inward to investigate that single spark of numinous clarity.\n\n**Dispelling the Myriad Demons**\n\nScatter all the host of demons, drive off the beasts of the western mountains.\nTen thousand trees of jade blossoms weave brocade—\never-springing, forever claiming rootless imperishability.\nCloud-friends from the four seas come and go in harmony.\nAbove and below, the primal harmony surges,\ngradually the six yang arise.\nA single ray of numinous light pierces bone and permeates marrow,\nthe fragrance of purity transforms the very scent of the womb.\n\n**Expressing My Feelings**\n\nI have nearly traversed the realm entire,\nten years of toil—lest I betray my master’s vow.\nNow old, I let go, leaving worldly affairs far behind,\nroaming mountains and rivers, following fate’s turn.\nI tell my kindred spirits: heed my counsel.\nThe kalpa’s blades and soldiers—each shall witness them firsthand.\nYet still they cling to craving, to love and attachment.\nHow can they escape the perils that lie ahead?\n\n**Composed at the Temple of Flourishing Peace in the Era of Great Prosperity**\n\nAncient traces, a jade palace—worthy of my resolve.\nCypress and pine, verdant and deep,\nbear the breath of everlasting spring.\nOnly when merit is complete shall deliverance be met,\nin wordless stillness, one accords with Heaven’s intent.\nFortunate to find this tranquil, serene abode,\nthroughout the day I wander carefree,\nmy heart unburdened by entanglements.\nNow aged, I withdraw of my own accord—\nwhen will the world’s endless clamor cease?\n\n**Remembering My Master**\n\nMy master often spoke of it:\nYanshan was the finest place under heaven.\nSure enough, it was there he was laid to rest.\nI record his meaning in these humble verses.\n\nWhere in the world is scenery so fine?\nMountains and seas commune in secret,\nnone compare to the Dao of Yanzhong.\nCloud-friends from the four seas gather and circle,\nmy master, in silent awakening, knew to return here.\nOnce entered into the Mystery’s gate, one must awaken early.\nWho understands the cultivation of truth?\nThis matter is not trifling.\nHeaven’s intent is clear—it allowed a temple to rise,\nYanshan’s thousand-mile embrace.\n\n**Ten Lyrics to the Tune \"Linjiangxian\"**\n*On the Manifestation of the Primordial Origin*\n\nSince parting from the capital, worldly affairs have dwindled,\nnot a speck of dust clings to my heart.\nIdle songs, idle verses—silently I nurture the spirit.\nAll that is \"with\" is but delusion,\nall that is \"without\" is the complete truth.\nEmbracing nature, a carefree wanderer of clouds and waters,\ndetached, indifferent, a man of leisure.\nFollowing fate, at peace, free from close and distant ties.\nThe three yang near their fullness,\nthe five qi naturally converge at the origin.\n\n**For Madame Yuan**\n\nMadame Yuan dwelt in the desert for ten years,\nthen left the household, returning to the capital.\nI compose these verses to honor her.\n\nTen years acquainted with the desert’s vastness,\nnow, in a single dawn, she returns to the capital’s gates.\nEach thought stirs sorrow in her soul.\nPut aside the tale of Su Wu,\nsay no more of Han’s Lady Zhaojun.\nPast and future—all swept aside.\nFortunate to meet the true master, Ever-Spring.\nYour devotion to the Dao grows daily anew.\nAugust Heaven would never betray virtue,\nnor would the Earth Spirit fail one so worthy.\n\n**Seated in Stillness at Western Mountain**\n\n**Seated in Stillness at Western Mountain (continued)**\n\nSeated in stillness at Western Mountain brings profound benefit,\nrarely does one encounter the affairs of the mundane.\nAll day, well-fed, I indulge my carefree indolence.\nNurturing a body of purity and quiet,\ntransforming into the true master within.\n\nFor thirty years, I sought in vain through chaos,\nnow, at last, I recognize the true countenance.\nWild passions extinguished, all dharmas empty.\nOriginally, there was nothing to be done—\nhow futile the thousand efforts expended.\n\n**Again**\n\nIt was ever a solitary thing,\nyet stained by attachments, hard to know.\nDeluded clouds disperse, the wind of wisdom blows.\nWhy seek beyond the self?\nSitting upright is the western heaven.\n\nA thousand words, ten thousand phrases—all in vain,\nyet enlightenment comes, and even \"one\" becomes false.\nAdvance at the pole’s tip, let no doubt arise.\nLet go of all, one by one,\nand every kind of bond will fall away.\n\n**Again**\n\nHaving penetrated the Quanzhen teaching of purity and stillness,\nwhy labor over scriptures and sutras?\nSeek the trace and reason here.\nDo not cling to deluded views,\nnor refuse to turn back.\n\nHow could the true nature ever be extinguished?\nBeyond true emptiness, idly searching.\nWithin it, desireless, recognize true cultivation.\nFollowing conditions, ever still and settled,\nresponding to things, naturally complete.\n\n**Admonition to the Assembly**\n\nEyes meet a thousand differences—nothing to grasp,\nthe mind at leisure, one realm suffices.\nThe true and constant, undimmed, the valley spirit clear.\nAll demons vanish from this,\nand the single point naturally achieves perfection.\n\nBeyond the world, chanting in purity brings solitary joy,\nin the human realm, what do honor and disgrace matter?\nI urge you to swiftly awaken and inquire of the path ahead.\nTo seek the true and real,\ndo not discuss false cleverness.\n\n**Reflections**\n\nThe Provincial Governor Li invited me to Shandong to bury the Three Masters.\nThe Daoist communities and common folk of Yanjing all refused.\nA decade has passed since we parted in Weiyang,\ntraversing the western frontier to the ends of the earth.\nReturning, I dwell in the immortal palace of Yan.\nEstablishing teachings to clarify the ancestral doctrine,\nexpounding the Dharma to follow the masters’ footsteps.\n\nHeaven’s will is not easily fathomed,\nhuman sentiments, once exhausted, are hard to plumb.\nMy heart has always loved simplicity and leisure.\nYet I am made to dwell north of the sea,\nnot permitted to cross into Shandong.\n\nBy chance, I found:\nThose who discourse on the wondrous and the profound are easily awakened,\nbut true purity and true stillness are hard to uphold.\nWorldly affairs are unworthy of pursuit.\nAmong the ten directions, those with clear eyes—\nwho study me lack discipline.\n\nHaving awakened, one must return to simplicity,\nthroughout the day, let plainness and sincerity abide.\nConcealing light, silent, outwardly like a fool.\nThe mind bright as the radiant moon,\nthe nature still, aligned with the perfect measure.\n\nWhat has form and center is easily found,\nbut formless and placeless are hard to attain.\nAll day, the shadow alone keeps me company.\nFools seek but do not see,\nthe enlightened already know.\n\nDiligently investigate this principle to grasp the truth,\na single great path without delusion.\nI urge you to swiftly awaken—do not hesitate.\nConstantly forgetting sight and sound,\nstep by step, enter the realm of mystery.\n\n**[Gift to the Daoist Assembly]**\nDuring my summer retreat on Wuhua Mountain,\na Daoist assembly came to see me, and I offered these words:\n\nFor years, I wandered the world through hardship,\nnow, by good fortune, I meet forest and spring.\nHungry, I eat; tired, I sleep.\nA few leagues from the city,\nlies another small paradise.\n\nSeated above, the mountains and waters all flourish,\nin the pond, blue lotuses bloom in full.\nIn old age, merit and conduct are hard to complete.\nUnable to reach the Three Isles,\nI first become an immortal of Wuhua.\n\n**[Eight Poems Free of Worldly Thoughts]**\n\n**To the Daoist Assembly of Longyang Abbey Requesting the Dharma of the Unified Mind**\n\nBeyond the three vehicles’ wondrous essence,\nthe fruit severs birth and extinction.\nAll things know emptiness—nothing to grasp,\nwisdom-nature shines bright, utterly clear.\nWithin stillness, heaven and earth;\nin leisure, sun and moon—\nworthy of sharing with a true friend.\nReturning to my mountain home,\nendless wind and moon await.\n\nA speck of formless true suchness,\nlimpid and profound,\ninner and outer indistinguishable.\nTo fathom the mystery’s core,\ncast off wayward thoughts and folly.\nDiligently discuss the subtle,\nfrequently cultivate the secret,\npenetrate the celestial mechanism’s key.\nIf not now, when will you rest?\n\nAgain:\nThe myriad beings, all from primordial qi,\nborn of the boundless.\nThe clamorous multitudes cling to self,\nwhile silent true emptiness eludes them.\nSeeking nothing within being,\nfinding being within nothing—\nwho discerns this truth?\nOnly the perfected ones, in their expedience,\nsing of the mystery’s essence.\n\nThis hidden gate of tradition\nrequires wisdom,\npurity to open the heart’s chamber.\nHaving seen the original true face,\nwhy covet fleeting splendor?\nDwelling in the human realm,\nname inscribed in the immortal register,\nnot a speck of dust allowed to delude.\nThe spirit unshaken,\nfrom of old, heaven and earth cannot fathom.\n\nAgain:\nWinter’s cold, summer’s heat,\nspring’s blossoms, autumn’s moon—\nyear after year, unchanged.\nOnly the body alters from dawn to dusk,\nunaware of life’s hastening end.\nThrough ten thousand kalpas of confusion,\na single moment of awakening—\nbest to still the heart and rest.\nNot a speck of dust clings,\nthe original luminous clarity.\n\nLeisurely facing tortoise, crane, and pine peaks,\nforest springs and secluded gardens,\nfreely opening the heart to joy.\nWhen merit is complete and work perfected,\nascending the assembly,\nonly then does a man’s heroism shine.\nThis principle is not profound,\nthe mystery’s mechanism not distant—\nyet without awakening, how can it be explained?\nWho in the world understands?\nIn darkness, years pass in vain.\n\nAgain:\nTo the ends of the earth,\nroaming freely wherever,\na body at ease.\nKnowing worldly affairs as empty as wind past the ear,\nyet finding some joy in fellowship.\nJade tripod simmering,\ngolden furnace boiling,\nrefining cinnabar elixir.\nConsumed, one departs,\nthe transformed body soaring beyond the void.\n\nThus the immortal Dao’s subtlety:\nshedding the dust of the mortal realm,\none joins the covenant.\nUnderstanding the principle, penetrating reality,\nvirtue perfected—\nwhy dwell in secluded cliffs and gorges?\nThe four marks dissolve,\nthe three corpses flee,\nonly because human sentiments are shallow.\nThe teaching of the Perfect Realization,\nthe great and upright heart—no error.\n\n**Following Another’s Rhyme**\n\nMingling with the world,\ngrasping the profound mystery’s intent,\ndelving into Zhuang and Lie.\nGathering cloud companions to uphold the true teaching,\nfollowing the former masters without distinction.\nOutwardly serene and kind,\ninwardly steadfast—\ntruly like the foolish and dull.\nGate pure, household quiet,\nnaturally revealing loftiness.\n\nThe boundless realm of Perpetual Spring,\neternally cool and refreshing,\neverywhere fit for rest.\nBeyond the world, in the purest realm of the pot,\nplaying amidst white clouds and golden palaces.\nBody lodged in the dusty world,\nnature reaching beyond the heavens—\nnothing can entangle.\nThe six senses unmoved,\nthis is non-arising, non-ceasing.\n\n**Mid-Autumn Moon Viewing at Qiyun Abbey, Da’an Mountain**\n\nDa’an’s lofty heights,\nwind and dew pure, air crisp—\nmid-autumn season.\nCloud friends and rosy companions gather,\ntogether admiring the mountain’s bright moon.\nIlluminating a thousand peaks,\nbrightening ten thousand ravines,\nsitting in joyful heart.\nSpirit clear, bones cold,\nforever transcending the world’s rise and fall.\n\nGazing upon this night’s splendor,\nwords and brush labor in vain—\nhow to describe such wondrous scenes?\nShining upon a thousand gates, all may delight,\nyet none compare to Qiyun’s purity.\nBefore the small courtyard, by the cliff,\nbeside the Great Cold Ridge,\nseeming to touch the heavens.\nSitting in silent contemplation,\nthis place is fit for dwelling.\n\n**Composed at Tongxian Abbey**\n\nTongxian’s secluded ground,\ndeep in the western mountains,\nleaning against the cloud-touched traces.\nOverlooking peaks upon peaks,\ncutting off the red dust’s news.\nStrolling amidst misty vines,\nquietly chanting to wind and moon—\nwho recognizes such matters?\nCultivators of truth,\nwhere else could one seek them?\n\nAn unbroken stretch of mountains and rivers,\ncave heavens and secluded gardens—\na realm of immortals.\nWho, entangled in fame and profit, can reach it?\nHard to accompany the pure and idle wanderers.\nSleeping high in jade grottoes,\nsitting steady on clear cliffs—\nwhy envy the mansions of kings and lords?\nI have come several times,\nlingering here many days.\n\n**On Nature**\n\nSpanning past and present,\nthis luminous, aware nature—\nnever lacking.\nWho recognizes its perfect wholeness?\nChasing appearances, lost in confusion.\nTen thousand actions,\na thousand creations—\nall resolved within the heart.\nA touch of mystery—\nwhen will you understand?\n\nNot entering the formless mystery’s gate,\nfloating names hard to relinquish,\ngreedily gazing at idle flowers and grasses.\nMouths speak of purity, hearts unenlightened,\nunaware of the wheel’s return.\nGrasping the true mechanism,\nstartled from the dream of illusion,\nfreely roaming the three isles.\nWith a share in long life,\nforever transcending the world’s decay.\n\n**Conclusion of the *Baoguang Collection*, Volume Two**\n\n**Ci Lyrics by the Perfected of Pure Harmony, Yin

keep to my secluded window, guarding simplicity,\nseeing through spring blossoms and autumn moons.\nWhen the meaning is grasped, I return—\nbest to rest body and mind.\nRest, rest—\nforging a furnace of spring snow.\n\n---\n\nTo speak of this toilsome life as a dream,\neach one deluded in empty slumber.\nSilently awakening the mind’s opening,\nattaining true communion in a pure dream.\nPure dream, pure dream—\nwho would believe the perfected are dreamless?\n\n---\n\n**Two Poems for the Unemotional Scholar**\n*Composed at Longyang Abbey when Qiuyang of Dongchuan came to visit. After the Lantern Festival of the bingxu year, written as parting verses before departure.*\n\nEach night at the third watch, we questioned one another,\nbreaking through the falsity of human sentiments.\nEach one awakened to the true source—\nthe heart of Dao flows free.\nI hope Qiuyang will turn his intent back,\nnot indulging in spring’s high sleep.\nSoon he will return—\nhis smile will bloom.\n\n---\n\nUnshunning the distant spring wind,\ncoming and going, silently conveying true intent.\nWhich one is my home?\nTrusting the ends of the earth.\nThe original nature, mysterious and unobstructed, without attachment,\nbrings peace to this body wherever it goes.\nAll is clear—no east or west—\ndwelling on Cloud Peak.\n\n---\n\n**Following Dongchuan’s Daoist Companions**\nA guest from Western Mountain awaits.\nWhat is this true intent?\nLo, lo.\nSeventy has always been rare—\nnow I reach sixty.\nThe floating world is not steadfast—\ndrunk and carefree.\n\n---\n\n**Reply to Daoist Friends of Xuande Prefecture at Qiuyang Abbey**\n\nDeep thanks for your invitation,\narriving just as spring’s command begins at West Cliff.\nA hundred birds clamor in joy—\nno delight left unexpressed.\nThe Daoist assembly fills the valley with harmonious qi,\nafter the rites, we await heaven’s will.\nKarmic affinity merges with emptiness—\neast or west, as it may be.\n\n---\n\nOnly wishing for a peaceful body and tranquil mind,\nwho would envy the comings and goings of invitations?\nThe true teaching fills the ends of the earth,\ncrossing the Flowing Sands.\nThe master’s intent is truly compassionate and universal,\nmeant to awaken all beings.\nCultivate boundless deeds—\nthe nature will then be round.\n\n---\n\n**Parting from Daoist Friends of West Mountain**\n\nI have wandered to the corners of the earth,\nyet none compare to the joy of West Mountain’s heart.\nWhen the mood is spent, I return east—\nmy temples streaked with silver.\nWe have both passed the age of sixty,\nwhat assurance is there after parting?\nOnly wishing each heart may rest—\nforever without sorrow.\n\n---\n\nThree elders share the blessing of purity,\nspending days roaming the mountains, never enough.\nSitting and lying amidst white clouds,\ngazing at green peaks.\nAfter the meal, on the eastern slope’s rocks,\nlaughter and talk open the heart’s vastness.\nSuch wondrous scenes banish sorrow—\nfacing the clear stream.\n\n---\n\n**Parting from Daoist Assembly of Weizhou**\n\nIn the tenth month, journeying through Weiluo to teach,\nsending off and welcoming carriages and horses.\nHarmonious qi fills the mountains and rivers—\nthe wind of the teaching spreads.\n\nWhen will we meet again after parting?\nOnly wishing each heart may awaken.\nAccumulate merit to three thousand—\ntransforming demons into spirits.\n\n---\n\nThe ninety-ninth day, severe cold with ice congealed,\nbehind the mountains, the north wind howls bitterly.\nHeading west—what is your intent?\nLo, lo.\nDaoist friends, a single word of farewell—\ntake care not to stir the heart.\nKeep your will steady and harmonious—\nthe Dao is without demons.\n\n---\n\nWherever there are Daoists and companions,\ndo not let human sentiments grow thick.\nIn all things, remain ordinary—\nfewer calamities will come.\nAfter parting, you should head west,\npatiently receiving and attending to all who come.\nOne day, we must meet again—\nlooking toward Zhongnan.\n\n---\n\n**Composed at Huairen County**\n\nI love Huairen in winter’s moon,\nwarm kang, bright window—fit for rest.\nHeaven’s will allows no idleness—\ncrossing South Mountain.\nEast or west, not by my wish,\nI have nearly traversed the corners of the earth.\nThe fruit of Dao is still unripened—\nI set forth once more.\n\n---\n\n**Retiring in Old Age to Qin Prefecture, Then Returning to the Great Longchun Abbey in Yanjing at the Imperial Summons**\n\nIn the tenth month, the lesser spring’s command,\nall things return to their roots, settling in stillness.\nOnly I wander between water and clouds—\ncrossing East Mountain.\nPointing straight to ancient Yanjing, without fixed abode,\nthough old, how dare I defy heaven’s decree?\nTurning my head to gaze at Zhongnan—\nI will come to visit again.\n\n---\n\n**Matching Rhymes to Part from Prefect Du of Qinzhou**\n\nUnenlightened, it is hard to align with heaven’s command,\nwho understands stillness born from movement?\nThe Dao lies between being and non-being—\nseparated by a thousand mountains.\nDeparture and stay, free from doubt, the heart settled,\nfollowing fate with carefree ease.\nAll day, not lost to the south—\nwhat more is there to seek?\n\n---\n\n**Seventeen *Jianzi Mulan Hua* Poems**\n*Composed at Qiuyang Abbey to Exhort the World*\n\nPiling gold, amassing jade,\nday after day, greed and stinginess never satisfied.\nWhat more is sought when enough is had?\nOnly awaiting the barren grave on the wild moor.\nThere is a path to turn back—\nwhy do fools remain deluded, unenlightened?\nIf they awaken and turn back,\nthey will spare themselves endless sorrow ahead.\n\n---\n\nThis toilsome life wastes lives—\nwho understands that clothing and food are all predestined?\nIndulging in desire, greed, and ignorance,\naccumulating karma like mountains, yet unaware.\nOne day, when retribution comes,\neven those with iron gall and bronze hearts will regret.\nSuffering without end—\nhow they will hate not having heard of early cultivation!\n\n---\n\nStubborn folly unceasing,\nfortune and misfortune still follow the body like a shadow.\nCalamities and heavenly disasters—\nall arise from the hearts of men.\nIf this principle is understood,\nall things should be seen as oneself.\nOnce the celestial truth is perceived,\ngood and evil at that moment rest entirely with man.\n\n---\n\nHarming others for self-gain,\ngreed, deceit, and cheating—when will it end?\nHarming the many to build a household,\nstill boasting of wealth and honor before others.\nDark records of yin deeds—\nwho will take your place when death comes?\nThe Dao of heaven is impartial—\nretribution is clear, each in its time.\n\n---\n\nIs heaven far?\nThe deluded world seeks it in vain.\nIs hell not near?\nCountless beings crowd its gates.\nWise and discerning noble ones—\nfortunate to be human, diligently set your will.\nWill set in a peaceful heart,\neven a single good deed, unspoiled, and the Dao is naturally fulfilled.\n\n---\n\n**Three Yang Daoists**\n*In Jinshan, there are three abbeys, each with \"Yang\" in their name. Hence, those who come and go here are called the Three Yang Daoists.*\n\nThree Yang Daoists,\nsitting opposite cloud peaks, discussing the non-dual.\nAll dharmas as they are—\nall contained in the cold laughter of forgetting the mechanism.\n\nThe true nature of ignorance—\nthis principle is hard to expound, how to realize it?\nTo realize the primordial origin,\nrecognize the lone autumn moon in the vast sky.\n\n*Autumn Yang Daoist Friend Visited*\nGolden waves and jade nectar—\napart from Guī River, nowhere to seek.\nJade nectar and golden waves,\na single draught harmonizes the five

mind are torn asunder,\nthis is the true visage of the primordial origin.\nTorn asunder, body and mind—\na will like a mountain, transcending past and present.\nIf you awaken to this trifling truth,\nyou escape the ceaseless coming and going.\nIf you awaken to this trifling truth—\nin ten thousand kalpas, such an encounter is rare.\n\n*Again*\nDwelling in the world, mingling with the dust—\nwho understands wordless intoxication?\nMingling with the world, dwelling in the dust—\ncontent in poverty, carefree and untrammeled.\nThe numinous source never dimmed—\nsurpassing boundless

authenticity, embracing simplicity—\nentering sagehood, transcending the mundane lies within each person.\n\n*Composed at Western Mountain*\nCultivating the true near the vulgar—\nthe initial stage is hard, the heart’s terrain must ripen.\nNear the vulgar, cultivating the true—\nwho remains unstained amid the dust?\nAmid forests and springs, indulging in delight—\nthis is cultivating the true, nothing to verify.\nIndulging in delight amid forests and springs—\nfor now, be a carefree immortal on earth.\n\n*Again*\nSettling in meditation amidst the village—\nhard to escape the trivial

Poems)*\n*Admonishing the World*\n\nSeeking immortality through false pretenses,\nDeluded in truth, chasing the Buddha-mind.\nBurning incense, bowing in vain pursuit—\nUnsevered ignorance roots deeper karma.\n\nBitter words are like good medicine,\nLoyal advice shines like fine gold.\nWhen one meets the virtuous, become their confidant—\nRely on the Orthodox Teaching,\nand ten thousand calamities cannot invade.\n\nAgain:\nAt birth, ignorance weighs heavy;\nAt death, hell yawns deep.\nEvery moment is more precious than gold—\nSwiftly awaken to non-arising,\nand the wise shall be your kin.\n\nIn a blink, one strays to other realms;\nTurning back, recognize the original mind.\nWhen merit is complete, one naturally transcends yin and yang—\nBeyond the world, truly at ease,\ncomposing verses in untrammeled clarity.\n\nAgain:\nDo not deceive others gravely,\nlest karmic retribution run deep.\nThe host of perfected ones descends to spread pure hymns,\nAdmonishing the deluded and

plainly shown,\nI recognize the source from which I’ve ever sprung.\nThe incense of stillness and non-action fills the censer whole.\nTen directions unobstructed, the Three Realms all resound—\nLet the years draw to their close, I care not where they run.\n\nA touch of wonder draws the gaze beyond the pass,\nWhere the true ones dwell, forgetting all coming and going.\nThree or four companions, clouds and mist their guise,\nSinging wild verses in carefree delight,\nContent in poverty, rejoicing in the Dao—\nBeyond this, nothing else is sought.\n\n**II**\nBanish evil from the heart and ever cultivate good,\nNaturally attaining the true and wondrous means.\nThe supreme Dao is level and plain, easy to behold.\nBefore your eyes, all is upright—\nLet right and wrong be set aside,\nA fitting companion for long life’s road.\n\nProfound words, once grasped, need no debate,\nSilently nurturing the true within, inner light appears.\nThe elixir of spirit, refined ninefold, now complete,\nTransforms the body beyond the void,\nSix ounces of celestial grace bestowed—\nThis face is no longer as it was before.\n\n**III**\nLet not the heart cling to fleeting splendor; return to the Dao,\nGradually penetrating the mysteries of the profound.\nWith the work of stillness perfected, the mind-ground is clear.\nAscend the far shore, forever claiming cool serenity,\nNo idle cares or vexations remain.\n\nThe true realm of everlasting spring knows no aging immortals,\nYet who can reach this cave-heaven, though it lies close at hand?\nAll dusty passions of the heart are swept away,\nWithin jade palaces and immortal courts,\nRiding the wind in pure delight,\nFeasting and roaming Penglai Isle.\n\n**IV**\nWhen the host of demons scatters, what confusion can remain?\nAll things are free from entanglement.\nA single gleam attends the Green Jade Table,\nNot a speck of dust clings,\nNo obstructions endure—\nThe face of emptiness is seen.\n\nI urge you: swiftly cast off worldly passions,\nBegin your practice now, lest the hour grow late.\nAhead lie wind and waves, deep and treacherous,\nYet the divine vessel sails steady,\nCloud-borne companions at your side,\nLaughing as they point toward the reed-flower shore.\n\n---\n\n**Seven Lyrics to \"Auspicious Partridge\" – For Junior Master Jia of Yanzhen Abbey**\n\nThe Daoist’s thoughts arise in no common way,\nYet old karma’s bonds entangle, bringing misfortune near.\nOnly through plain and earnest cultivation can the true endure,\nWhile vain and hollow learning of the Dao cannot long prevail.\n\nThoughts arise and fade, the heart finds no repose,\nBut unmoving, unshaken, the mind is easily guarded.\nAwaken early to the eternal, and merit will amass—\nThen, when the time comes, your resolve will stand firm and strong.\n\n---\n\n**Ode to Western Mountain**\n\nDeep in Western Mountain dwells the Daoist’s home,\nWhere nurturing the Dao and refining the true finds no equal place.\nThrough the nine summer months, high sleep banishes the heat,\nIn autumn’s third season, new melons bear their fruit.\n\nBelow the rugged slopes, millet and grain thrive,\nBy the muddy river’s edge, wheat and hemp grow tall.\nThrough all four seasons, harmony reigns, worldly affairs are few—\nFrom dawn to dusk, the Three Primes are the whole of life.\n\n---\n\n**Passing Dragon Spring Valley**\n\nA fine stretch of folk along Western Mountain’s range,\nWinding waters encircle the peaks like a grotto-heaven.\nNo right, no wrong, no favor, no disgrace—\nOnly flowers, fruits, and forest springs.\n\nEvery household reveres the Dao, welcoming idle guests,\nEach door honors the altar, paying homage to the great immortals.\nWith such diligence in virtuous deeds,\nPeace and joy abound in years of plenty.\n\n---\n\n**Admonition to the Assembly**\n\nDebating Dao and Chan, vying in clever turns,\nEyes half-closed in drowsy haze, lost in confusion’s maze.\nStill chasing fame and profit, the heart remains ensnared—\nHow can one know the harm to self or aid to others?\n\nWorthy friends keep their distance, sages stay far away,\nWhile false companions draw near, like wolves and tigers at your side.\nWhen the reckoning comes and regret is vain,\nAwaken early, gather your heart—do not indulge in deceit.\n\n---\n\n**Again**\n\nFortunate to encounter the flourishing of the teaching,\nYet why cling to worldly glory, letting time slip by?\nReduce food, lessen sleep—spirit grows bright and clear,\nForget passions, cast off desires—qi becomes pure and refined.\n\nFor a time, vigilance wards off suffering and woe,\nBut long practice transcends life and death.\nI urge the wise to reflect and awaken—\nWhile body and strength endure, begin your cultivation.\n\n---\n\n**Exhortation to the World**\n\nThe teachings of Everlasting Spring are entrusted to purity and harmony,\nExhorting the wise to emerge from the river of desire.\nCultivate virtue and Dao—heaven grants joy,\nWhile clinging to worldly passions breeds demonic ills.\n\nSet down the present and wander the true realm,\nFor deep merit in life leads to the Great Luo after death.\nI speak these loyal words plainly—\nConsider them well, and what will your heart decide?\n\n---\n\n**Again**\n\nSix years of effort yield modest achievement,\nRoots deepen, stems strengthen, growth unfolds in time.\nEast court and west palace host idle guests,\nDaoists journey south and north along the way.\n\nHarmonious qi from all directions invigorates the spirit,\nThe Dao-eye shines clear across the four seas.\nThe celestial wind of mysterious workings arrives here—\nOn Yan Mountain’s road, a bright path lies ahead.\n\n---\n\n**Two Lyrics to \"Southern Village\"**\n\n**I. Casually Composed at Baoxuan Hall**\n\nBy nature fond of ease and indolence,\nUnburdened by fame, untroubled by poverty.\nCarefree, following conditions without hindrance,\nThe heart is open—\nSeeing through all worldly affairs as empty.\n\nGain and loss are fundamentally the same,\nWhy trouble over movement or stillness, fortune or misfortune?\nStolidly advancing, true contentment is found—\nSuccess lies\nIn wordless, cold amusement.\n\n---\n\n**II. For the Daoist of the Western Route**\n\nFortunate to meet with good causes,\nYet vainly entangled in fleeting fame, enduring hardship and toil.\nAll for some trifling matter before your eyes—\nProcrastinating,\nYou’ve passed the midpoint, and the body is changed.\n\nSit in silence, guarding the numinous root,\nBeyond the void, idly seeking the void’s truth.\nRecognizing the wondrous, subtle thing from the primal beginning,\nIt may be embraced—\nCall it immortal, not human.\n\n---\n\n**Lyric to \"Yu the Beauty\" – Exhortation to the World**\n\nOf late, my spirit seems to surge,\nSeeing through the dream of human life.\nAll because of tranquil contentment, delighting in purity and harmony.\nWith no selfishness toward things,\nLight shines across the mountains and rivers.\n\nNow I urge all who cultivate the true:\nDo not wait until it is too late.\nOne day, departing, you’ll regret your humble state—\nLamenting that you did not,\nIn those days, toil diligently in practice.\n\n---\n\n**Lyric to \"Moon over the Sea, Crabapple Blossoms\" – Admonition to the Assembly**\n\n**Five Poems on Treading the Clouds – Presented to the Daoist Assembly of Changchun Palace**\n\nThe late Master’s departure left boundless merit,\nDaily presiding over a thousand altars, manifesting sacred forms.\nWith a hundred, a thousand transformations,\nIn secret, guiding souls to and fro.\nBeware of slander—\nLest misfortune descend, how will you face it?\nIn an instant, enlightenment spreads to the utmost,\nGathering disciples far and wide, offering universal reverence.\nOnly uphold fasting and precepts,\nWith wholehearted devotion, each cherishing reverence.\nIn the vast emptiness,\nSurely the divine will bestow rewards.\n\n---\n\n**Wise sons of intelligence,**\n**Bright and discerning superior men.**\nFortunate to meet the Master’s guidance in cultivating the true,\nPreserving light in halls facing green mountains,\nWhite clouds fit companions for the Ever-Spring Master.\nDelighting in the Dao, illuminating the mind,\nSurpasses poring over classics and histories.\nNames inscribed in the register of immortals—\nLet all diligently guard the numinous trace,\nWill Heaven fail those of lofty and pure resolve?\n\n---\n\n**Self-Reflection**\n\nPaltry profit, hollow fame—\nWho can renounce them?\nAhead, the path is perilous, yet still they cling in greed.\nOnly I dare not indulge in vanity,\nFor my heart holds a vow to transcend the Three Realms.\nWidely spreading a breeze of compassion,\nNever slackening in effort.\nWith a mind embracing forbearance, ever patient,\nOpening the heart’s ground like empty space,\nClearly perceiving that which is truly indestructible.\n\n---\n\n**Again**\n\nHidden high immortals,\nOpenly bestow protection.\nWhite clouds’ immortal traces shall be fulfilled.\nOur lineage’s Seven Ancestors guard Mount Yan,\nA myriad golden lotuses, fragrant and resplendent.\nLet the assembly settle their minds,\nThat Daoists may endure long.\nTogether cultivating pure virtue beyond the stars,\nWhen merit is complete in years to come, we shall ascend to audience with the Origin—\nThe late Master will surely grant the wine of immortality.\n\nWithin stillness, clamor; amid clamor, stillness—\nWho discerns the wondrous workings of the numinous source?\nTwo inverted states merge into emptiness,\nNaturally revealing the true message.\n\nQi traverses the Three Passes,\nSpirit roams the Eight Extremities.\nCeaseless, traceless, it comes and goes—\nNow cease seeking, abandon inquiry,\nAnd all doubt shall vanish on the path ahead.\n\nIn praise of the Master’s immortal form, imperishable:\nJade bones, pristine in origin,\nGolden elixir already perfected.\nEternal spring, ageless—what year could bring decay?\nA single nature, rounded and complete, pervades the Ganges’ sands,\nYet the discarded husk remains whole, unchanged.\n\nRare across ten thousand generations,\nScarce in any age—\nDisciples from the ends of heaven gather in haste.\nDwelling in peace, they venerate the true countenance,\nBurning incense for a hundred thousand spans, three days unbroken.\n\n*Six Poems in Crimson Dots*\nComposed five days after the Double Ninth\n\nThe body enters emptiness,\nYet this alone cannot serve as proof.\nOn the path of true emptiness,\nQi and spirit converge—\nThe yang spirit emerges.\n\nShould you meet a kindred soul,\nThis matter may be entrusted.\nHearken well, cast doubt aside:\nWhen cultivation is complete, heaven itself shall guard you.\n\nAgain—\n\nI hear of cultivation’s ways,\nA thousand differences, ten thousand divergences—hard to rely upon.\nOn the path of true emptiness,\nWho attains the essence?\nOnly one who lets go may return.\n\nDeeds accumulate boundlessly,\nMerit must reach three thousand.\nWith awakened heart,\nStroll freely on cloud-steps,\nAscending beyond celestial immortals.\n\nAgain—\n\nSeeking the Dao, pursuing truth,\nCalm the mind, endure the search for the right path.\nThe handle of the elixir knife—\nHosts of immortals rejoice,\nA single luminous pearl gleams.\n\nIlluminating the primordial origin,\nRecognizing head and shadow as one—\nDivine and sagely,\nWithin, pure joy abounds,\nBeyond the world, idly chanting.\n\nAgain—\n\nCultivation is hard to achieve,\nIgnorance stirs flames everywhere.\nSummoning calamity,\nTime slips by in vain—\nHow escape birth and death?\n\nAwaken early to past transgressions,\nNo longer cling to self and others.\nReturn to truth,\nEver clearly discerning,\nSet to work and reap the immortal fruit.\n\nAgain—\n\nRadiant Double Yang,\nCrisp autumn air stirs pure delight.\nSinging immortal songs,\nYellow blossoms match the season,\nEach petal reflecting true nature.\n\nSmall balustrades fragrant,\nThe assembly seated in reverence.\nTruly serene,\nPure wind, untainted—\nTen thousand households, a thousand gates rejoice.\n\n*Roaming Fiveflower Mountain in Late Spring, Following the Master’s Rhyme*\n\nYesterday’s spring outing,\nOur company seemed to ride phoenix and simurgh.\nKindred spirits together,\nHearts at ease, we ventured forth,\nStraight into the Peach Blossom Grotto.\n\nBy the clear stream,\nIdly listening to the zither’s three refrains.\nTrue joy stirs,\nFreely welcomed and sent off—\nWhat care for Zhuang Zhou’s dream?\n\n*Divination Song*\nAt Jade Void Abbey’s night scene, the Master ordered all to hasten—\n*Divination Song* was renamed *Northern Bliss*.\n\nTrue nature, do not wander in vain,\nThe two

cool other shore—\nThe work of purity is complete.\n\n*Three Poems for the Sagely Dynasty*\nAfter the Yizhou Ritual, Guo Zhiquan was commanded to expound two chapters on the Dao and virtue\n\nAncient bonds run deep,\nGood roots planted firmly,\nThe steadfast heart of the aspirant.\nMoved by our gate’s vast teaching,\nBroadly opening the way—\nTogether we discourse on merit’s fulfillment.\n\nSleepless through the night,\nCloud-borne companions in lofty assembly,\nPenetrating the profoundest mystery.\nWithin the five thousand characters,\nForget the fish-trap and grasp the fish—\nBehold the immortal within yourself.\n\nDeep in the quiet night, I don robes and sit at ease,\nListening to the stringless zither.\nCeasing lofty discourse, subtle words silently penetrate the mystery—\nFreely abiding in the turtle’s unbroken breath.\nYin and yang rise and fall,\nThe four greats harmonize in balance,\nBones strong, spirit whole.\nEmbracing the primal origin, a single point completes the practice—\nBehold the dancing immortal embryo.\n\n*Mid-Autumn Moon Viewing at Taiping Xingguo Abbey*\nThe sea is calm, the mountains still,\nAutumn’s pure light fills all,\nA cool night gathers kindred souls.\nWe open our hearts,\nDelighting past the third watch,\nFurther discoursing on the profound.\nPerfect clarity dawns in sudden awakening,\nSelfless and universally illuminating,\nVirtuous deeds fully encompassed.\nThis very night, perceiving thoroughly, all natures interpenetrate—\nAttaining the immortality of the solid earth.\n\n*Ten Lyrics to \"Yi Jian Mei\"*\nFollowing the rhyme of Master Yilaci Zhongze, composed at Yonghe Hermitage in Yizhou.\n\nOnly when the ninth nine-day period ends does the sun warm.\nSpring harmonizes with lofty virtue,\nDreamless, the heavens stretch long.\nRoaming freely through the ten directions and three realms,\nSummer’s heat still met,\nUnheeding autumn’s frost.\n\nAwakened to true leisure, all affairs forgotten,\nNaturally at ease and joyful,\nThe mind-ground cool and clear.\nThe original single point expands boundlessly,\nDispersing all demons,\nAlone manifesting majestic radiance.\n\n*Addressing the Assembly, Reusing the Previous Rhyme*\nExternally accumulating hidden merit, internally fortifying yang.\nThe everlasting spring addresses the assembly—\nThese words are especially long.\nIf one can suddenly awaken to non-doing,\nPast karma dissolves like frost beneath the blazing sun.\n\nNo need to still the mind or forget the six desires.\nWhen merit is complete and conduct fulfilled,\nTranscending heat and cold.\nCarefree and unconstrained, drifting east or west,\nThoroughly awakened to the human realm—\nThus concealing one’s brilliance.\n\n*Addressing the Assembly at Taiping Xingguo Abbey*\nHeaven bestows Pingyao as a fine place to rest the heart.\nJade halls lie hushed,\nAncient cypresses stand dense.\nCool shade tightly seals the grotto-heaven’s seclusion,\nVillages nearby,\nYet quieter than mountain forests.\n\nWho can seek the Way of purity and non-doing?\nAt Taiping Xingguo Abbey,\nFind a true kindred spirit.\nI urge you to swiftly awaken—do not delay.\nAccept it in this very moment,\nAnd the worthy and sagely will descend upon you.\n\n*Sent to Daoist Friends in Weizhou*\nBeyond the waters beside the immortal’s pot,\nBy the Western River we bade farewell,\nSincerity and depth unforgettable.\nUnable to speak at leisure before setting out,\nCrossing the ridge through bitter cold,\nMy coming intent hasty.\n\nFortunately, peace reaches the land of the Dao,\nHunyuan abounds in sufficiency,\nAll affairs at peace.\nIf someone travels east, send them new verses,\nTo report to kindred spirits\nAnd reveal my conduct and whereabouts.\n\n*Ode to the Front High Mountain*\nNewly acquired, the front high mountain stands in a cluster.\nA realm of pure emptiness,\nAn ancient immortal altar.\nHeaven pities my arduous toil,\nGranting me advanced years,\nTeaching me to open my countenance.\n\nSilently I thank the lofty vault for bestowing leisure.\nAmid pines and upon rocks,\nAll pursuit is severed.\nJoyfully content, delight knows no bounds—\nWorthy to behold whether walking or sitting.\n\n*Again*\nNewly acquired, the front high mountain proclaims itself.\nA realm of pure emptiness,\nAn ancient immortal altar.\n\nPeaks rise sheer and towering,\nPines and cypresses stand in rows.\nThe Daoist’s plan to retreat from the red dust—\nIn the azure grotto, high and serene,\nNo affairs to bind the

      "translated_text": "**Preface to the *Baoguang Collection***\n\nWhen the primordial chaos had yet to divide, it already contained the true essence of Heaven and Earth; as clarity and turbidity began to separate, the subtle workings of yin and yang unfolded. Thus, the Three Powers were established, the myriad transformations completed, all things flourished, and extraordinary persons emerged among humankind.\n\nSuch was the True Person, surnamed Yin, of the illustrious lineage of Cangzhou. His ancestors, born of a single mother, produced nine sons in three births, seven of whom were enfeoffed across eight counties. Thereafter, their cap and sash flourished in splendor—even now, stele inscriptions attest to their renown. Yet the True Person’s achievements surpassed all.\n\nIn childhood, he entered stillness, contemplating the origins of Heaven and Earth’s creation; in youth, he left the household, mastering the secrets of nature, life, and transcendence. He guided others and saved beings, examined the ancients to regulate the present, fathomed the beginnings and ends of all affairs, and ranked the worthies of past and present. His beneficence was vast, his transformations boundless; he embraced all with magnanimity, acted without contention, and though provoked, did not retaliate. Where he desired benevolence, benevolence arose; even the unvirtuous were covered in goodness.\n\nThis was because he grasped the sentiments of alignment and opposition, understood the causes of the hidden and manifest, and though the past could not be admonished, the future could yet be pursued. He knew advance and retreat, preservation and loss, and practiced forbearance in matters great and small. Slander did not sway him, nor did praise or blame alter his course. In all things, he was thoroughly versed, trusting in the ebb and flow to guide his path.\n\nHe moved with the current, blending his traces with the dust; he endured disgrace to secure his person and employed words to admonish the world. His refined verses, inscribed on bamboo and silk, conveyed meaning to ten thousand ages without omission; his dharma teachings, disseminated far, aimed to benefit the present moment.\n\nHe could succeed the Quanzhen in expounding the teachings, chronicle the orthodox lineage to perpetuate its fragrance, open the mysterious gate of all wonders, and point the straight path to the Three Purities. Like the sun of wisdom suspended high, he dispelled the shadows of heresy, greatly revived the ancestral wind, and swept away all malevolence and filth. Thus, his gate and courtyard were pure and bright, his realm cool and serene—banishing the lost paths of dark nights to join the sublime domain of Everlasting Spring.\n\nHe planned to open a numinous pond, planting myriad golden lotuses; to empty the spirit-boat, bearing a single wheel of luminous moon. Yet knowing that people are difficult to discipline and the Dao does not force its way, he cherished the treasure within and sat in forgetfulness, or expressed his cares through play. Without leaving the square inch of his heart, he traversed distant wilds, then grasped the great thousandfold world and contained it within a hair’s tip.\n\nHis mind-field shone bright, illuminating all before perception, hearing, and awareness; his nature-ocean was deep and limpid, perfectly reflecting the cycles of dwelling, decay, and emptiness. Moved, he responded; set aside, he concealed. He was indifferent to non-arising, carefree in quiescence. Unmoving, he transcended the heavens beyond kalpas; ever-present, he abided in the realm before his eyes. All things he examined and penetrated, everywhere he perfected—effortlessly grasping, instantly releasing.\n\nMaster of all gates, he awakened to the myriad dharmas and returned them to the heart; having cultivated across many kalpas, he realized the One Truth and merged with the Dao. Thus, long departed from the dusty world, he dwelled for ages in the immortal realm, roaming freely amid the azure vaults, enjoying the mysteries within the Pure Capital.\n\nAbove, he matched the millennial covenant of his master and father; below, he awaited the appointed time, manifesting his own body on the following day. This is called: the highest ritual has no form, the utmost yielding has no words—embracing the unnameable name of beauty, uniting with the ancient virtue that claims no virtue.\n\nHis causes were auspicious, his reasons selfless. Holding the subtle mechanism of the great Dao, he displayed the elegant model for transforming others. Though trifling conduct may seem insignificant, it ultimately accumulates into great merit. His purity of bearing was sufficient—how could it lack praise?\n\nThese reckless, wild words dare to extol his profound sentiments, unafraid of transgressing the three thousand prohibitions, privately invoking the ten thousand vanished traces of the Master’s truth.\n\nThe *Baoguang Collection* is the work of this True Person. For thirteen years after receiving the teachings, he often sat in the inner chamber of the Baoguang Pavilion within the Baoxuan Hall of the Great Everlasting Spring Palace. Daily, scholar-officials from the capital and esteemed elders from afar came to seek his counsel, request instruction, or solicit poetic exchanges. Sometimes he expressed his feelings to dispel ennui or offered admonitions and encouragement. During his travels through various regions, he also composed colophons and eulogies upon encountering scenic sites.\n\nThe poems, lyrics, songs, and hymns he gathered were arranged in order and divided into three volumes, named after the pavilion. Some say *bao* means \"to conceal,\" signifying the concealment of numinous awareness to prevent its outward dissipation—though responding to myriad changes, it never loses its empty and tranquil essence. *Guang* means \"to illuminate,\" signifying the piercing of darkness to advance unfettered, avoiding pitfalls to enter the realm of the subtle and formless. *Ji* means \"to gather,\" signifying the accumulation of treasures like pearls and jade, deployed to aid the impoverished and suffering.\n\nSuch is the general meaning of this compilation—whether it is apt or not.\n\nOthers say poetry has four refinements: refining words is inferior to refining lines, refining lines to refining structure, and refining structure to refining intent. Intent is the function of aspiration, the culmination of poetic thought. Thus, what is in the heart becomes aspiration, and when spoken, becomes poetry. The completion of poetry need not rely on exquisite words or robust lines. The *Feng* and *Sao* were beautiful in their time, but beauty lies in virtue, and virtue exalts aspiration. Aspiration is endowed by the Dao; moved, it stirs and is entrusted to words; harmonized and regulated, it becomes literature. Literature arises from words, and if words are blameless, then thoughts are without deviation.\n\nTo rectify emotions and nature, clarify gains and losses, uphold loyalty and trust, reject cunning schemes, cease aggression, embrace softness and weakness, treasure compassion and frugality, abandon extravagance and excess, revere lofty integrity, and beautify education—these are the profound attainments of the True Person’s poetry.\n\nAs he said:\n*\"True treasure lies in the heart’s sincere conduct;\nEmpty words from the mouth are hardly marvelous.\"*\n\nAnd again:\n*\"Where the source of wisdom arises, treachery and deceit flourish;\nWhen courtesy and decorum are manifest, the Dao and virtue decline.\"*\n\nAnd again:\n*\"A violent nature often hears of men transformed into tigers;\nA compassionate heart indeed sees trees where dragons take flight.\"*",

world’s fleeting hours rush past—\nit knows neither glory nor withering, nor the cold of years.\n\n**For a Daoist Friend Who Requested Tea**\nA crisp clarity arises, ever free and bright;\nthe demon of sleep is vanquished, coolness gained.\nAll that is wrought must end in rise and fall—\nonly the unburdened, natural state endures.\n\n**Ascending the Heights**\nAs white dew scatters, autumn’s depth grows keen,\ncrimson leaves drift down through the chill woods.\nAt the Pavilion of Yellow Blossoms, three joys arise—\nwine in hand, I sing aloud to dispel the mood.\n\n**Self-Reflection on the Love of Stillness**\nFrom the first, right discernment lies in man’s priority;\nseeing affairs, one seeks the wondrous mystery.\nOnly now do I know my past errors—\nwhen words and self are forgotten, nature is whole.\n\n**Another**\nOften I see indulgence invite calamity,\nyet never has the perfect Dao brought misfortune.\nHow have immortals through the ages attained their lot?\nAll from preserving the mind in stillness.\n\n**Hearing the Sound of a Lute by Moonlight in Baoxuan Hall**\nThe vastness of Yanshan stretches wide, the night deep and clear;\nseated, I hear the calls of passing geese, one or two.\nThe worldly toil ceaselessly, their hearts still bound—\nthe recluse sits in silence, his ears keenly attuned.\n\n**Another**\nAfter autumn, Baoxuan grows ever more serene;\nin the hush of night, the cries of geese resound.\nSitting in stillness, the sleep demon finds no hold—\nmoonlight and the heart’s aperture both luminous.\n\n**Viewing Cock’s-Comb Flowers**\nA riot of reds withers after ten days,\nyet the deep purple of late autumn still withstands the wind.\nDo not regard all idle blooms as one—\ntheir natures differ in what they endure.\n\n**For Academician Chen**\nDebates arise from varied views,\nyet none grasp the true reality.\nWorldly chatter cannot exhaust the depths—\ntranscendent discourse lies in the heart of things.\nWho understands that window companions remain as paper apart?\nOutside and within, two winds blow.\n\n**Responding to Five Poems Presented by Academician Wu**\nFortunate to be a man, grown in the Central Land,\nyou claim the highest immortal’s rank among your peers.\nFollow the ways of Master Pang and the Xu family—\nlift your whole household lightly, sparing them the barren mounds.\n\n**Another**\nContent in solitude, I dwell in quiet joy,\nspared the world’s hollow praise.\nWhen nature is still, the true teaching flows naturally—\nwith a heart at ease, why labor over books?\n\n**Another**\nCultivating the real, I seek no reliance on the natural;\nyear after year, I put it off until next.\nI wait only for the Dark Lord’s promised sign—\nwhere now to seek the immortals?\n\n**Another**\nWithout resolve, man cannot find leisure;\ndusk and dawn pass, temples turn silver.\nAll say the groves and springs nurture the Dao—\nhow many through the ages have reached their home mountain?\n\n**Composed at Tianchang Abbey**\nA fleeting name, lightly grasped, becomes a demon;\nhow much more so the tangled affairs of human feeling?\nClinging to appearances, wavering without decision—\nwhat end awaits such a path?\n\n**For Academician Chen, Who Requested a Poem on His Cap and Hairpin**\nI cherish meeting minds with open hearts,\nyet lightly bestow cap and pin.\nYour bones bear no trace of the common dust—\nwhen will you return to the groves?\n\n**For Director Liu of Yanjing, Who Renounced the World to Dwell at Yunfeng Abbey in the Western Hills**\nThe teaching flourishes in the northern wilds,\ndrawing thousands to the assembly.\nYou alone have savored its truth, awakened first—\ndwell in stillness on Western Mountain, turn back no more.\n\n**Another**\nIn Pengcheng, your karmic bond with the Dao runs deep;\nyou submitted your vow, knocking at the gate of mystery.\nNow you become master of Yunfeng—\nbefore reaching Penglai, you are already immortal.\n\n**Occasional Verse from Baoxuan Hall**\nSeeing through the emptiness of body and all dharmas,\nstill and unmoving, yet responsive when moved.\nThe true and constant meets the world without hindrance—\ndivine transformations reveal sacred power.\n\n**Another**\nDay after day, the sun rises east, sets west,\nfleeting clouds encroach on the brief light.\nSixty years have passed, old age approaches—\ntreasure each moment in the empty studio.\n\n**Seizing the Unenlightened Mind**\nDo not indulge the unenlightened mind’s fiery karma;\nwhere it arises, true nature lies.\nWhen touched, see through its wondrous subtlety—\nthen turn the unenlightened mind into your light.\n\n**Five Watches Hymn on Cultivation**\n\n**First Watch**\nAfter evening audience, the first watch begins,\nI gather my spirit’s radiance into the great void.\nNo worldly clamor disturbs my ears—\nin the stillness of nature, joy knows no end.\n\n**Second Watch**\nIn the second watch’s hush, true leisure is found,\nqi flows ceaselessly, coming and going.\nWhen the three fields are full, yin ghosts vanish;\nwith ninefold refinement complete, one joins the immortals’ ranks.\n\n**Third Watch**\nAt the third watch, the first yang stirs at the third point,\nthe six jia, three origins, and five qi grow pure.\nIf not for the root of nature transcending creation,\nhow could the treasure of life attain perfection?\n\n**Fourth Watch**\nBy the fourth watch, demons retreat, their troops dispersed;\nsound sleep brings peaceful rest, hailing great peace.\nIn dreams, all is clear, nothing clings—\nawakening, a lingering purity remains.\n\n**Fifth Watch**\nAt the fifth watch, the fifth point, the night wanes,\na will firm as steel, still as a mountain.\nDo not say immortals cannot be found—\neternal life lies in questioning the inch of heart.\n\n**Bidding Farewell to the Perfected One Before Journeying to Jinshan**\nThe great kalpa churns, still unsettled—\nI take leave of my master, my heart iron-hard.\nWhat can compare to the Daoist’s resolve?\nEven death, when it comes, is no easy matter.\n\n**On the Twenty-Fourth Day of the Eleventh Month, Jia-Shen Year, Taking Leave of My Master**\nWith several riders, we part from ancient Yanjing,\ncrossing the northern pass, my spirit unbound.\nLightly, I fulfill my lifelong wish—\non horseback, I chant idly, entering the grotto-heaven.\n\n**Another**\nA fair wind bears me to Jiashan,\nwhere I pillow on stone, sleep amid clouds, at ease.\nNo clamor of the dusty market reaches my ears—\nmy heart takes flight, recalling the western pass.\n\n**Another**\nIn the third ninth-day cold, snow blankets the mountains;\nthe east wind carries me past Yuguan.\nHuman feelings fade, heaven grants its favor—\nperhaps my future holds a share of leisure.\n\n**Composed at Qiuyang Abbey**\nI hear Qiuyang’s scenery is secluded,\nwhere immortals have trodden these cliffs.\nThe verses of Perpetual Spring are truly fit for painting—\ntheir fame spreads far, ceaselessly.\n\n**Another**\nNow I wander here at leisure,\nchanting poems, my mood unspent.\nRecalling the renowned guests of Tianchang—\nhow many have returned to these cliffs?\n\n**Another**\nI have crossed countless famous mountains,\nyet none compare to Qiuyang’s serene beauty.\nLast year, a true immortal passed this way—\nthis winter, a wandering guest arrives.\n\n**Spring Day**\nQiuyang lies far from the imperial domain,\nunaware of the Eastern Lord’s subtle workings.",

sits in wordless absorption—\nall day, carefree, he wanders alone.\n\nIn the gengyin year, returning from the *jiao* rites at Tongxian Abbey,\nI take leave of Daoist friends, the Marshal and the Military Overseer with verse.\n\nLong weary of the world’s ways, I loved the mountains deeply,\nyet my share in the hills was meager—eastward I return.\nMy work incomplete, I follow fate’s turns,\nstill restless, never at ease.\n\n**XI**\nFor days I lingered, loath to leave the Western Mountains,\nyet letters summoned me back at once.\nI sigh—my temples streaked with age, the years grown old,\nwhile worldly ties still will not grant me leisure.\n\n**XII**\nA thousand *li* of mountains stretch in endless ranges,\nwhere for years I lingered, coming and going.\nNo path was too rugged when I set out,\nhoping to claim this peace for life.\n\n**XIII**\nIn Yan, they urged me to leave Mount Jia,\na few riders lightly turning east again.\nNot for the coldness of incense or white clouds,\nbut for the heart’s own freedom—pure and idle.\n\n**XIV**\nRange upon range, uncounted mountains,\nthe Daoist roams without thought of return.\nBefore mastering the wondrous subtleties of the Perfect Truth,\nwho attains the carefree ease of true leisure?\n\n**XV**\nFive quatrains newly composed to bid this mountain farewell—\nwhen will I return after parting?\nIf you can cast off both movement and stillness,\neverywhere you go, the mind is free—at last, at ease.\n\n**Taking Leave of the Daoist Assembly at River and Mountain**\nThe sound of water, the hues of mountains—void of feeling,\nyet between them, the spirit grows clear.\nNot for the weight of worldly ties here,\nbut to recall the joy of a lifetime upon return.\n\n**XVI**\nDelighting in the Dao, forgetting schemes—this is true nature,\nroaming hills and streams, the eyes grow bright.\nIn old age, no place of rest,\nonly endless wandering east and west, south and north.\n\n**XVII**\nThe Mystery Teachings dispel delusion, far from worldly cares,\nwhen worldly cares are wholly cut, the Daoist heart shines clear.\nSince first arriving, little has transpired—\nonly to probe the mystery of life and death.\n\n**Postscript to the *Ten Elders* Scroll**\nTen idle ones, idle and pure,\ntheir clarity of vision keen.\nI bid you sit in idleness—\nwhat skill is honed in leisure’s midst?\n\n**Staying at Xiantian Abbey in Fanshan for the Summer, Exhorting the Assembly**\nTo the southwest, war’s desolation still rages,\nwhile here in the northeast, summer months bring cool repose.\nIt is fitting to practice goodness here,\ncultivating virtue and burning incense of renown.\n\n**XVIII**\nThe great kalpa unfolds in chaos, desolation everywhere,\nyet by fortune, this place knows cool tranquility.\nI urge you to redouble efforts in cultivating true blessings—\ngradually, you will sense the fragrance of non-action and purity.\n\n**XIX**\nOnce I followed my late master through vast wastelands,\nreturning, I rejoiced in this cool refuge.\nWhile war’s clamor has not ceased, this land thrives first—\nfor its people are honest, their virtue fragrant.\n\n**XX**\nEach person, lost in delusion, wanders in desolation,\nhow can the heart find cool repose?\nPierce through the snares of the world, return beyond things—\nnaturally, virtue and the Dao will be fragrant.\n\n**XXI**\nRefining the nature, penetrating the true—no desolation,\nlet creation shift between heat and cold.\nWhen merit is complete, ride the crane to Penglai Isle,\nleaving behind a name fragrant through ten thousand ages.\n\n**Parting from Daoist Friends at Fanshan**\nBeyond things, carefree, far from worldly demons,\nnon-action, non-striving—preserving purity and harmony.\nI have come here many times, grown familiar with the ways of men,\nwhere reason is thoroughly explored, the good are many.\n\n**XXII**\nEmbracing the One, never straying, roaming beyond things,\nadrift alone, steering the great spirit-boat.\nIn the boundless sea of suffering, countless souls—\nwho will still their hearts and take the hook?\n\n**XXIII**\nSincere words urge an early turn,\nyet those who heed not sink into the Nine Dark Realms.\nThe Great Sage cannot lift them out—\nrecognize the truth now, swallow the hook.\n\n**On the Gushing Gold Pool Behind the Hall of Xiantian Abbey**\nA wooden plaque floats upon the pool’s surface,\nwarning all not to defile it.\nRolling, the sacred spring flows deep through the years—\nlet not a speck of filth intrude.\n\nThe world sees only boundless water,\nbut in my eyes, it is inexhaustible gold.\n\n**Passing by Ma’s Estate in Clearwater Village near Yantai, Delayed by Rain**\nThe wind from Fufeng stirred the heavens,\na night of clouds birthing ceaseless rain.\nAll things in the west reach fruition—there is trust in this,\nyet a thousand gold pieces cannot buy a single true friend.\n\n**Expressing My Feelings**\nYears of seeking the Dao—only now do I begin to succeed,\neach trial of demons brings renewal.\nWhen demons come often, the heart must not waver—\nonly when demons are exhausted does the single truth shine clear.\n\n**XXIV**\nThe Seven Perfected cultivated virtue, moving the heavens,\ntheir single act of mystic wind passed beyond the Jade Pass.\nThe *Shuidiao* song’s friends proved true,\nthrowing wide the gates, leaning upon Yan Mountain.\n\n**Three Quatrains on Journeying to the Offering at Guozhou**\nFor a year, I dwelled in the Pavilion of Constant Contentment,\nbody and mind at last somewhat at ease.\nThe Teachings’ call made me know the difficulty of escape—\nyet I did not shun the distant journey to the *jiao* feast.\n\n**XXV**\nNorth of the ridges, the wind is cold—an ancient truth,\nthrough three winters, I crossed the Yanmen Pass.\nThe Daoist’s compassion and kindness are a treasure,\ndelivering the dead, mourning the living—forming good karmic ties.\n\n**XXVI**\nBriefly parting from the Hall of Compliance in Yan City,\nI journeyed on my master’s behalf to other lands.\nNot that I sought to cling or stir up connections—\nbut the *jiao* host’s sincerity could not be forgotten.\n\n**Inscribing Ink Bamboo**\nThe Ink Lord paints the four seasons’ spring,\nleaf upon leaf, branch upon branch—far beyond the dust.\nSeizing creation’s power, wielding it in hand,\neach stroke brings forth something new.\n\n**Self-Description in the Pavilion of Constant Contentment**\nIn the Pavilion of Constant Contentment, mountains and seas are whole,\nwind and moon accompany the passing years.\nThose who seek to see me have no other words—\nall call this place the Little Grotto-Heaven of Everlasting Spring.\n\n**XXVII**\nThis small pavilion holds mountains and seas in full,\n\"Constant Contentment\" its name—ease in old age.\nWhere better to find idleness and freedom?\nWhere else to seek the Gourd Heaven?\n\n**Passing by Nanxin Village in Jin’an Prefecture, Presented to Daoist Du**\nAt six, he left home—ninety-one now,\nthe single truth shining through four, three, seven.\nToday, by good fortune, deep karmic ties meet—\nall dharmas forgotten, all affairs

coolness filling the eye.\nHeaven has granted this old body leisure and ease—\nby Five-Flower Pond, what a joyous wind!\n\n**Again**\nWho has mastered the inner cloud-wandering,\nroaming the eight directions without a care?\nIn this realm of purity and stillness lies an inexhaustible treasury—\nI ask you: where is the end of the journey?\n\n**Again**\nHaving exhausted human sentiments, one sees the sentiment of the Dao,\nyet the sentiment of the Dao is still a forced name.\nIf one can awaken to the wondrousness of no birth,\nthey will transcend Nan Hua and Chi Cheng.\n\n**Five-Character Regulated Verse**\n**In Praise of the Scripture of Purity and Stillness**\nThe three powers, pure and still in principle,\nthose who know awaken to true feeling.\nSupreme virtue is fundamentally

      "translated_text": "**The Four Seasons All Like Spring**\nYear-round, spring’s embrace remains.\nAll day I sit in carefree ease—\nnot a speck of dust remains.\n\n**Ancient Tune: A Poem**\n*Traveling with Daoist Friends to Great Mountain Temple*\n\nMountains layer upon mountains,\nrivers wind in endless bends.\nDaoist friends invite me up the peak—\ntwo or three cloud-kissed huts stand there,\nand every face in our midst beams with joy.\n\n**Passing Jin Shrine on the Qingming of Yiwei Year**\nNow Taiyuan, once Taiyuan,\npast and present blur into obscurity.\nOnly the waters before Jin Shrine’s temple\nflow clear and deep, untouched by time.\n\n**Sending Bean Congee to Daoist Companions in Yanjing**\nBitter greens soften,\nadzuki congee thins—\ntwo flavors I’ve always favored,\none truth brings eternal peace.\nAfter eating, the four elements harmonize;\nwhen sated, the six spirits leap with joy.\nIn old age, such simple pleasures suffice—\nworldly affairs fade entirely away.\n\n**Recorded Sayings**\n*Instructions to Disciples by the Heavenly Perfected Daoist*\n\nThe teaching of the Perfect Realization (Quanzhen) school centers on the subtleties of nature, life, and virtue. Yet most scholars today fail to investigate their unity. For thirty years, I received oral transmissions and heart-to-heart teachings from the realized masters Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma—countless profound words on daily transgressions and blessings. Though I grasp the principles, my true practice and conduct often fall short, making it difficult to transcend the mundane and enter sagehood.\n\nNow, Lord Longxi, who has long been devoted to the Dao, has unexpectedly joined us. He earnestly seeks the subtle teachings I received from my masters, wishing to apply them himself and instruct later learners. Reluctantly, I set down a few points.\n\nThe Dao is never far from humanity—it is people who distance themselves from it. Many recognize that the Dao, Buddha-nature, and life are one, yet differences abound. They do not realize that practice inherently possesses wondrous nature, entirely free from attachment. Wisdom and life support each other, aiding the true stability of one’s nature, entering the unobstructed Dharma gate, merging into true oneness, forever transcending birth and death. Attaining spiritual freedom and self-mastery, one sees immediate proof—this is the wondrous Dao.\n\nIf a practitioner’s resolve is firm yet enlightenment remains elusive, it is due to past deficiencies in merit. Those who remain single-minded to the point of death and rebirth will emerge as enlightened beings. The sages will not overlook them; a gentle nudge opens the heart, and the Dao becomes effortless.\n\nThe master said: To understand the myriad dharmas, one must also not cling to them. Free from clinging, all dharmas are empty in form. Clinging to dharmas is grasping at the finger; not clinging is knowing where the finger points. Knowing where it points, one sees that all dharmas are empty. With this clarity, one becomes unbound and free, a person of few words who preserves life.\n\nFurther, acting upon the world with transformative power—decisive, bold, unstained, unattached—inner and outer merge in harmony. Accumulating merit and cultivating conduct day and night, even if one does not ascend in flight, one becomes extraordinary, a person of insight and courage, meeting all things with no-mind. Those quick-witted with eloquent speech may not grasp this; they are difficult to guide.\n\nTo advance on the path, one must not waste time before death—every moment is precious. As a Dao seeker, you must penetrate to the ultimate reality. Do not neglect the teachings of masters and friends. Even if you are enlightened, refine your practice through mutual inquiry until results appear. Only then can you stand alone without change and traverse all without exhaustion.\n\nHere, I briefly record these matters—subtle teachings imparted to me by realized masters. I humbly hope that those of shared aspiration will practice together and cross to the other shore.\n\n**Direct Words**\n*Addressed to the Daoist Community of Chongyang Abbey and Youde Abbey*\n\nThe karmic affinity with this ancestral court is no small matter—it differs from other places. This is where heaven permits the assembly of sages to propagate the teachings, the foundational site of our school. Those within its fold must revive and rebuild it with true practice, sincere devotion, and unwavering resolve when faced with demonic obstacles.\n\nOnly through single-minded accumulation of merit and conduct can this land be purified. Daoists who grasp this truth find that one unit of merit here equals ten elsewhere—so too with all endeavors. If the merit is great, it need not be known by me; may the assembled sages recognize it. If the sages truly send me to inspect your progress, your earnest requests will bring me. But if merit is scarce and transgressions many, calamity will strike—no small matter.\n\nNow, I return with these truthful words to announce to the Daoist communities of Chongyang Abbey and Youde Abbey. Let all take heed. I earnestly hope that those with Daoist aspirations will carefully consider these words—they deeply benefit you. Do not doubt; proceed with sincerity and begin at once. Do not delay. The perfected ones will never fail you.\n\n**Seven-Character Quatrain**\n*As Chongyang Festival Nears, Yuan the Perfected Gathers at Five Flowers Abbey—A Poem for Him*\n\nThough Five Flowers blooms with spring’s splendor,\nnothing compares to idle wandering in the ninth month.\nA thousand trees blaze in autumn hues, mountains like brocade—\nimmortals gather here, a lesser Penglai.\n\n**Sent to Duan Zhenqing and Others**\nA myriad golden lotuses bear fruit as one,\nFive Flowers in late autumn is just the time.\nThis rare gathering of yang’s radiance is hard to encounter—\ntell the cloud-bound friends to come early.\n\n**Reply to Wang Zizheng**\nWhy rest the heart, then rest the brush?\nSeeing through all, emotions return to primordial purity.\nGrasping the unobstructed in the sutras,\nthe heart-ground naturally becomes clear and empty.\n\n**End of the First Volume of *Preserving the Light Collection***",

      "translated_text": "**Before one’s eyes, recognizing these few things—**\nthis is the true lineage of the Quanzhen.\n\n**At Longyang Abbey on the Winter Solstice**\nThe moon’s radiance illumines the four seas,\nDragon Yang’s qi fills the Three Fields.\nA single thunderclap shakes mountains and rivers,\nbursting forth with flashing lightning.\n\nDharma rain ever falls on the virtuous,\ncompassion clouds spread boundlessly.\nOnly now is the Great Peace revealed—\nfulfilling my lifelong vow.\n\n**II**\nHeaven’s immortals know no confusion,\nbut in the world, natures remain stubbornly dull.\nFortunate are those within our gates who study the scriptures—\ntheir dharma-nature shines forth in awakening.\n\nUnderstanding principle, they grasp wondrous being;\nobserving emptiness, their bodies merge with the void.\nWisdom pierces the numinous treasure, returning to the primordial—\nwho comprehends that none are saved without the teachings?\n\n**III**\nTo advance in the Dao, rely on steadfast resolve;\nguard the heart, never wander recklessly.\nHear my earnest counsel, fellow seekers—\ndo not wait until your hair turns white with procrastination.\n\nGreen locks and rosy cheeks fade swiftly,\nyouth and daylight cannot be detained.\nHow much better to swiftly awaken and turn back—\nrecognize these faithful words of guidance.\n\n**IV**\nBehind the mountains, the abbey is restored,\nwhile south of Yan, war still rages.\nThe Daoist’s merit and conduct have long accumulated—\nspared from misfortune and harm.\n\nEach day, recite scriptures to bless the realm;\nthroughout the morning, chant the Dao to subdue demons.\nFortune arises, calamity vanishes—nurturing harmony,\ntruly still, truly pure, attaining the fruit.\n\n**Returning to the Mountains**\nWritten in Tianchang during the height of summer,\nreturning to the mountains just as autumn arrives.\n\nFor nine summers, Tianchang’s heat was oppressive;\nbehind the mountains, autumn brings coolness.\nA valley of ripening millet stretches green—\nthe western harvest is in sight.\n\nNo matter how distant the ends of the earth,\nor how desolate the lands beyond the passes,\nif all is well before your eyes, it is an immortal realm—\nlet your heart follow conditions and be at ease.\n\n**II**\nDo not envy the clamor of the capital’s markets,\nnor shun the simplicity of a mountain home.\nThe cries of apes and cranes only deepen one’s joy—\na heart at peace is priceless.\n\nBy night, companions are the pure wind and bright moon;\nat dawn, one gazes upon green pines and rosy clouds.\nWith disheveled hair and a topknot, this is my life—\nworthy of being painted on a secluded screen.\n\n**III**\nBeyond the window, mountains stretch like a painting;\nbefore the gate, flowing water is fit to hear.\nThis secluded cave-heaven sees few travelers—\nit is no path of the dusty world.\n\nSeizing the wind and moon in stillness,\nfar removed from the world’s bustling affairs.\nSerene, the six senses rest in tranquility—\nfreely singing, freely chanting.\n\n**IV**\nWithin the moon, the golden crow heralds dawn;\nat midday, the jade hare sleeps.\nWho knows the myriad dharmas are inverted—\nthis principle is neither deep nor shallow.\n\nRecognizing this primordial thing,\none must understand the true Chan of no-affair.\nEvery person possesses a nature that is whole and perfect—\nonly because they fail to turn it.\n\n**V**\nSuperficial sight brings knowledge and discernment;\nprofound insight brings no awakening, no delusion.\nSuddenly realizing, one enters the level and rare—\nthis is the true wisdom of a man.\n\nIs the Dao far from the square inch of the heart?\nWhere in the western heavens is the bright mind?\nAll day, sitting in leisure, pondering deeply—\nonce the mechanism turns, it is done.\n\n**VI**\nWith desire, one struggles to transcend old age and sickness;\nwithout emotion, the face easily retains its youth.\nAn empty mind and full belly settle the six spirits—\neach step is cool, reaching the other shore.\n\nNine years can dissolve the four marks;\nten years will surely arrive at the Three Mountains.\nRoam freely through Penglai and Langye—\nspared from the world’s cycle of rebirth.\n\n**For Daoist Tian**\nIn movement, do not let the nature move;\nin stillness, never let the heart doubt.\nBefore your eyes, all is upright, without obstruction—\ntrue stillness, true purity—this is it.\n\nQi fills the Three Fields, naturally full;\nthe spirit penetrates the eight meridians, then you will know.\nSuddenly realizing, one enters non-action—\neverywhere, the heart rests in stability.\n\n**For the Assembly of Ten Thousand Lotuses**\nIn every matter, familiarity brings contentment;\nletting go of each thing, the body feels light.\nThe primordial point must be perfected—\nwondrous words and profound speech are worth hearing.\n\nIndulging the will, one forgets the self;\ngathering the heart, one becomes aware of ignorance.\nWhen ignorance is extinguished and worldly passions cease—\nthis is recognizing the mind and seeing the nature.\n\n**The Path into West Mountain**\nStone steps and cloud ladders—treacherous paths,\ngrasping vines and creepers—difficult to traverse.\nDeep within the cave-heaven, water and mountains gleam—\nfar removed from the dusty world’s sights and sounds.\n\nIn an earthen cave, sleep is peaceful, sitting is steady;\namid pine cliffs, the ears are quiet, the heart is clear.\nNo need to envy Xu You’s fame—\nthis is transcending the ordinary and entering the sacred.\n\n**II**\nNot for love of green mountains and emerald waters,\nbut to conceal my traces and bury my name.\nCoarse robes and simple food, cutting off worldly ties—\ncultivating the primordial root.\n\nQi congeals, spirit solidifies—long life;\nan empty mind and full belly—immortality.\nOne day, when merit is complete, the Three Pure Ones appear—\nthis is the true nature of a man.\n\n**Exhorting the Assembly to Reduce Sleep**\nIn summer, diligently cultivate the precious hall;\nin winter, refine the stubborn heart.\nAt the third watch, do not yield to the sleep demon—\nthis is the master’s precept.\n\nStudy the Dao, do not be deluded by false thoughts;\ncultivate the truth, do not lose the monastic community.\nWhen the merit of non-action is complete, freely sing—\nresting at ease, sleeping soundly.\n\n**Contentment Brings Joy**\nAll day, gazing at mountains and playing by waters,\nthroughout the day, the heart rests in contentment.\nIn old age, what more is there to seek?\nPreserving my yang for ninety-nine years.\n\nFortunate to be human and comprehend the Dao—\nwithin the Dao, there is another return.\nWhen merit is complete, cloud-stepping to view Yingzhou—\nan eternal name, undying.\n\n**For Master Zhang**\nDaily, tending the stove’s flame on the turtle’s head,\ntimely, extinguishing the smoke within the chimney.\nFrom beginning to end, unwavering in single-minded devotion—\nbetter than endlessly coming and going.\n\nLaying down the tangled affairs of the world,\nclearly understanding the bright and luminous profound words.\nOne day, when merit is complete and the spirit is perfected—\nselected for Penglai.\n\n**To Daoist Friends in the Capital**\nOnly because merit was lacking and conduct incomplete,\nam I thus compelled to wander east and west.\nSince parting two years ago,\nthe road has turned, the wind and dust stretch for ten thousand miles.\n\nMy words are sent to the assembly in Yanshan—\nhear my earnest exhortation, do not doubt.\nThough external conditions may intrude, forget the mechanism within—\navoid future regrets.\n\n**II**\nThough worldly affairs have long wearied me,\nhow can a Daoist bear to return empty-handed?\nWithout diligence and hardship, reaching the western passes,\nhow could one attend Chongyang’s celebration?\n\nI tell the aspirants within our gates—\nthe ancestral court’s roots are already visible.\nThe beauty of Zhongnan Mountain is wondrous in all ages—\nthe elderly may plan to stay long.\n\n**For the Confucian Scholar Wang Zizheng**\nThe original nature is fundamentally empty and non-dual—\nwhy then are emotions and desires entangled?",
      "overlap_context": "agon—\nthis alone is heaven on earth.\n\nCloud-kissed huts and thatched cottages nestle close,\nimmortal blossoms and rare fruits perfume the air.\nWhen worldly visitors arrive, they find cool serenity—\nraising their hands, they cannot but gaze in awe.\n\n**V**\nI love Autumn Yang’s weather,\nwhere a single finger points the cloud-path clear.\nWhy seek Cao Xi beyond the body?\nHere the three bodies and four wisdoms are fully seen.\n\nAsk not of heaven’s profound mysteries,\nnor chase the effortless Great Dao.",

wishing for a peaceful body and tranquil mind,\nwho would envy the comings and goings of invitations?\nThe true teaching fills the ends of the earth,\ncrossing the Flowing Sands.\nThe master’s intent
