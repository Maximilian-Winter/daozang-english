  "full_translation": "**Preface to the *Record of Nurturing Life While Mingling with the World***\n\nAmong all things between Heaven and Earth, man is the most noble. This nobility sets him apart from the myriad creatures. What man values most is honor and glory; what he treasures most is his nature and life. Born from the essence of Heaven and Earth, shaped by cold, heat, dryness, and dampness, he must harmonize and preserve them—accord brings no pestilence, while discord invites a thousand ailments to converge, even cutting short the span of life itself. Between these extremes lie premature deaths, chronic pains, and afflictions of lameness and blindness, all arising from the missteps of nurturing and care.\n\nYet there are also innate afflictions—extra fingers, dangling growths, and protruding wens—these are the common troubles of birth, not errors of one’s conduct. Thus, the five colors dazzle the eyes, the five tones deafen the ears, the five flavors delight the palate, and the chase of game maddens the heart. To cast aside these four is to become a person beyond the dust of the world.\n\nThose who dwell in deep mountains, abide in remote valleys, befriend apes and monkeys, or herd with deer—abandoning the pleasures of the mortal realm to feed on darkness and dine on mist, seeking to match their longevity to Heaven and Earth—are scarcely one or two in ten thousand. Yet even a slight mastery of moderation in diet and desire spares one from untimely misfortune.\n\nIn my youth, I indulged excessively in rich foods and wine, and illness clung to me. Reflecting on its cause, I saw its roots. Thus, I turned my heart to the Dao, roamed forests and springs, and forgot worldly cares, gradually recovering. Though dull by nature and ignorant of the principles of avoidance and nurture, I have roughly followed these restraints for twenty years and found them effective.\n\nYet life’s span, success, and failure are fixed by fate. If one cannot preserve harmony but instead exhausts the spirit, forging gold and refining cinnabar to fuel desires, abandoning benevolence and righteousness in pursuit of fortune—hoping for eternal life—this is the height of delusion! For if the skin cannot endure, where will the hair cling?\n\nAs for those who cast off worldly ties to ascend emptiness, riding dragons and commanding cranes—these are those who have accumulated hidden virtues life after life, practiced benevolence and righteousness generation after generation, and possess an unyielding nature, their endowment firm and unshaken. Such outcomes are not the work of herbs and elixirs.\n\nAncient records speak of men living hundreds of years, yet none are said to have studied the arts of Dao or sought immortality. Tortoises, dragons, snakes, and cranes have no recipes for consuming fungi or mushrooms. Pine and bamboo endure frost without withering, while creeping vines wither before autumn—these are the natural natures of things. Does the great Dao of Heaven and Earth favor some creatures over others?\n\nWild beasts do not die unless struck by arrows, for they follow their natural inclinations—eating when hungry, drinking when thirsty, indulging desires in due season, without entanglement. Man, however, often dies young or suffers illness, driven by greed for fame and profit, exhausting his spirit, forcing down herbs and elixirs, indulging desires without restraint, ignorant of taboos, indulging in excess, overeating, and glutting himself on warmth. Yet earth, wood, springs, and stones are all shaped by creation, bearing strange and wondrous forms—and man is no different.\n\nMoreover, wealth, rank, and glory are but fleeting moments, matters not of the body’s essence. Only nurturing life and cultivating nature bring tranquility of spirit and extended years.\n\nHere, I set forth ten essential chapters on moderation, titled *Record of Nurturing Life While Mingling with the World*. These methods have been tested and proven, not mere empty words. Though they do not delve into profound study or meticulous refinement, they provide a general outline. I have not recorded every detail in full, but if fellow seekers of the Dao encounter this, may they glean a few insights.\n\n---\n\n**Volume One of *Record of Nurturing Life While Mingling with the World***\n*Compiled by Hermit Liu Ci of Mount Mao*\n\n**1. Moderation in Diet**\n\nFood is the foundation of life and cannot be abandoned even for a moment. Deviating from moderation or neglecting cold and warmth gives rise to illness. Unable to consume elixirs of cinnabar and mist or regulate primordial *qi*, one must instead moderate diet and desires in daily activities—walking, standing, sitting, and resting. This is the finest medicine, yet its daily practice is often overlooked.\n\nOne should eat warm foods before cold. Why? The kidneys belong to Water, and Water’s nature is cold; thus, warm foods warm them first. This principle holds in all seasons, but it is especially beneficial in summer, when hidden *yin* resides within.\n\nAvoid excessive fullness, for it harms the heart, causing shortness of breath and oppression. After eating, rub the abdomen dozens of times and exhale upward twenty times—this greatly aids digestion. Do not lie down immediately after eating, lest it lead to lung *qi* disorders, obstructing circulation and causing blood stasis. Fatigue in the limbs and excessive sleepiness give rise to a hundred illnesses.\n\nAfter eating, one must relax for a while, walk thirty to fifty steps to aid digestion, and wait until the heart and viscera feel empty before lying down. When resting, avoid speaking, singing, or whistling. The five viscera are like bells and chimes—they do not sound unless struck. This is the subtlety of nurturing.\n\nFood assists *qi*, but overeating obstructs its flow. After eating, avoid lying flat, as it often leads to *qi* stagnation and head wind. Do not eat greedily or hastily—haste harms *qi*, while greed harms the spleen. A damaged spleen becomes a source of dietary taxation, one of the five labors of men.\n\nAfter eating, avoid strenuous activity, riding horses, climbing heights, or traversing perilous paths, lest it harm the internal organs. Do not eat at night, for after sunset, the spleen ceases to grind, as all sounds fade away. The spleen delights in music—when strings and bamboo are heard, the spleen grinds, as the *Rites of Zhou* says: \"Music aids the meal.\"\n\nThus, all sounds and tones are governed by the spleen. If the abdomen is slightly cold, food will not digest, and the stomach will also be harmed. A damaged stomach leads to regurgitation, and regurgitation prevents the reception of grain *qi*. Once grain *qi* is not received, vomiting ensues, and vomiting may turn into the ailment of regurgitating stomach. After nightfall, one should not eat to satiety with meat, noodles, or raw sliced fish. In summer, when nights are short, this is especially to be avoided. Raw fish must not be eaten with dairy products. Though such foods may digest by night’s end, they severely harm the spleen and stomach, causing spleen taxation. Toward nightfall, one should not eat fried cakes to satiety—this is particularly damaging for those prone to wind *qi*.\n\nAfter eating hot foods, do not rinse the mouth with cold water; after eating cold foods, do not rinse with hot water. The clash of cold and heat often leads to toothache and exposed tooth roots. When eating roasted meat, consuming it while hot often causes wind sores, blackened teeth, or gradual tooth decay and loss, while also obstructing the flow of blood and *qi*.\n\nAfter a full meal, one should stand and urinate; when hungry, urinating promptly is most beneficial, lest the bladder be harmed. Greasy foods are particularly unwholesome, as they darken the eyes and cause coldness and slipperiness in the intestines and stomach, often stirring wind. Those suffering from wind sores or *qi* ailments should especially avoid them.\n\nA slight reduction in the five flavors refreshes the spirit, though the *qi* of the kidneys particularly favors salty foods, which also help digest undigested food. Well water should not be consumed in excess, for overindulgence in any one flavor will harm the corresponding organ. Thus, excessive salt harms the sinews and must not be indulged; sweetness harms the stomach, pungency harms the eyes, and bitterness harms the *qi*. Fright harms the *hun*, sorrow harms the spirit, thought harms the intent, indulgence harms the emotions, and resentment harms the will.\n\nProlonged seeing harms vision, prolonged hearing harms acuity, prolonged walking harms the sinews, prolonged lying harms the blood, prolonged labor harms the bones, prolonged standing harms the limbs and joints, and prolonged speech harms *qi*. Do not drink to excess when extremely thirsty, nor eat to satiety when ravenous. Do not indulge in great joy or great sorrow, nor rest excessively after great labor. Desire great gains but not great losses, for anger harms the upright *qi*.\n\nExhaustion from great labor depletes the viscera, great hunger harms the organs, great fullness blocks the interstices, great thirst disrupts the meridians and obstructs *qi*, great drunkenness scatters the spirit, great laughter causes *qi* to fly upward, great fear leaves the heart disoriented, great heat blocks *qi*, great cold congeals the blood, excessive sleep separates the spirit and *hun*, and great fright unsettles the heart. These are all signs of harm to longevity.\n\nOne should always avoid eating animals that have died of themselves, rancid beef that is difficult to digest, overly salty or sour foods that cause dryness and slipperiness, cold and greasy foods, raw scallions, garlic (both large and small), raw coriander, unseasonal foods, melons, fruits, flour porridge, and cold noodles—none of these accord with the Dao of nurturing life and regulating the body.\n\nWhen taking medicinal remedies, one should especially avoid three kinds of meat that lack sufficient *qi*: chicken, pork, and scaleless fish. One should also avoid three kinds of vegetables that lack sufficient vitality: *junda* (Indian lettuce), lettuce, and spinach, as they obstruct the blood.\n\nIf one does not constantly regulate one’s conduct in movement, stillness, sitting, lying, eating, and desires, even consuming lingzhi mushrooms daily or drinking morning dew will be of no benefit. Tonifying medicines that assist yang, if relied upon to maintain fullness, will over time cause great harm—how could this not be foolish?\n\nWhen eating meat or vegetables, if one encounters tough or stringy bits, do not swallow them. These are difficult to digest and, if retained, often form abdominal masses or accumulations, also causing spleen taxation. Furthermore, one must not eat or drink in the presence of stars and moonlight, in temples, monasteries, famous mountains and rivers, ancient altars, sacred trees, or burial grounds—such places are forbidden by Daoists and should be strictly avoided.\n\n**On the Regulation of Drinking Wine**\n\nWine corresponds to the celestial bodies, its origins stretching far back. The wise drink it and become wiser; fools drink it and become more foolish. It dispels sorrow, enlivens the will, vents anger, and emboldens speech—all through this substance. Thus, the ancient kings drank it with ritual and music, the worthy drank it to cultivate their nature, and ordinary people drank it to indulge their desires. Only wine is said to have no fixed measure.\n\nRaising pigs to make wine was not intended to cause misfortune. Therefore, one should not drink to excess or too frequently. Extreme drunkenness severely harms the heart and spirit, causing the liver to float and the gallbladder to become unruly, while also inviting wind and damaging the kidneys, ruining the sinews, and rotting the bones—nothing is more harmful than wine. After a full meal, it is especially to be avoided.\n\nThose who frequently drink wine often suffer from lung *qi* disorders and wind ailments; otherwise, they may experience heaviness in the lower back and knees or cold pain in the bladder—these are all variations of the same harm. After drinking, one should not induce violent vomiting, for this causes the liver to overturn and the gallbladder to deplete. The liver is the gallbladder’s repository; once depleted, the gallbladder withers, and a withered gallbladder leads to timidity. Timidity causes frequent fright and palpitations, restless sleep, and forgetfulness, gradually scattering the heart and spirit. When harm is perceived, one should take heart-tonifying pills.\n\nWhen drinking wine, do not do so hastily, for haste may rupture the lungs. The lungs are the canopy of the five viscera and must not be harmed. If damaged, one will often suffer from nasal discharge, lung *qi* disorders, lung atrophy, and coughing illnesses. Those with consumptive *qi*, wind sores, or the five types of hemorrhoids must strictly avoid wine. For those with wind ailments, wine infused with medicinal herbs should be consumed without becoming extremely drunk.\n\nAfter drinking, do not consume cold water or cold tea, for wine will carry these into the kidney organ, where they become stagnant toxic water that must be expelled. Over time, this often leads to heaviness in the lower back and knees, cold pain in the bladder, water swelling, wasting-thirst, and spasms—all arising from this cause.\n\nAfter drinking, do not lie down immediately; one should move about to prevent the wine from soaking and damaging the bladder and intestines. Observe how the houses of heavy drinkers easily decay—this makes the principle clear. In all seasons, drinking warm wine is best. In winter, it is enough to dispel the cold; it should not be scalding hot, for heat harms the heart and lungs. All foods and drinks should be consumed warm, not just wine.\n\nIn summer, stir-fry black soybeans until hot, then steep them in wine; when the liquid turns purple, drink it warm—its power to regulate qi is unmatched. In autumn and winter, gauge one’s own constitution, whether cold or hot, and infuse wine with appropriate medicinal substances—this is most excellent. Nowadays, people often use grapes or malted wheat for this purpose, but such clever counterfeits disrupt the true remedy and should not be mixed with other ingredients. The ancients valued plain wine and unseasoned broth for their simplicity.\n\nWine, when taken in moderation, is beneficial; in excess, it harms. A little wine guides qi, enhances the efficacy of medicines, moistens the skin, improves complexion, unblocks the channels and collaterals, regulates qi, resists frost, and repels warm pathogens. On an empty stomach, one must never inhale foul or noxious odors or visit the homes of the sick—drinking wine alone can ward off evil toxins. Once, three men ventured out at dawn through the dew: one had eaten his fill, one was fasting, and one had drunk wine. The fasting man died suddenly, the full man fell ill, but the one who drank wine remained healthy.\n\nWine benefits when taken properly, but harms when overindulged. Moreover, as a substance that rots the intestines, it must not be consumed recklessly. Wine’s nature is intensely hot—even in the bitter cold that freezes the sea, only wine does not congeal. When brewing wine, one waits for the wind and tides to stir before proceeding, thereby harmonizing the transformative work of yin and yang. Thus, excessive drinking cools the body.\n\nMen, whose yang qi is often weak, may further deplete themselves by wandering about after drinking or fanning themselves to cool down. This leads to deficiency and damage, and later, wine draws yin qi to congeal in the lower burner. Or, if still intoxicated and parched with thirst, one drinks tea or water, the wine carries these into the waist and knees, where they lodge in the bladder as stagnant toxic water, congealing in the lower burner. Without potent medicines or a skilled physician, this cannot be expelled—hence, drinking to excess cools the body.\n\nIt is commonly seen that in summer, people steep wine in wells, while in winter, they mix it with butter or yogurt—both practices are gravely harmful, inevitably causing cold disorders in the waist and knees. Butter and yogurt in wine trigger consumptive spasms and stir phlegm diseases, which cannot be easily dispelled.\n\nThe reason wine intoxicates is due to its *niè* (fermented lees) nature. When the qi of *niè* dissipates, it all turns to water, which congeals in the waist and knees with no means of expulsion. After drinking, one should not sit outdoors in the wind, expose bare flesh, or fan oneself, for the pores are all open, and wind must not be allowed to enter—if it does, it may cause paralysis of the limbs, wind-induced disorders, or even hemiplegia, all arising from this cause.\n\nConsuming rich delicacies while cold or drinking chilled beverages may bring momentary pleasure, but over time, they invariably lead to harm.\n\n**Spring Regimen (Third)**\nMan mirrors the yin-yang and Five Phases of heaven and earth, and the subtle shifts of the four seasons’ killing qi—even a hair’s breadth of deviation may invite pestilence. Thus, the hands and feet resemble heaven and earth, the blood vessels mirror rivers, hair corresponds to grasses and trees, caution in anger reflects thunder and lightning, the eyes are like the sun and moon, and desires are observed as the sprouting of life. If seasonal qi deviates slightly, many will fall ill with epidemics; reversing the season’s mandate invites pestilence. Examine this closely, and not one case in ten thousand will be missed.\n\nIn spring, sweating, vomiting, and purging therapies, as well as acupuncture and moxibustion, are appropriate. Taking *Continuing Life Decoction* or *Shuyu Pills* is most effective. From the Winter Solstice onward, at midnight, yang begins to emerge—yang qi is exhaled, yin qi is inhaled. Residual heat in the heart and diaphragm clashes with rising yang qi, like two tigers meeting on a narrow path, bound to fight. At the transition between spring and summer, this gives rise to cold damage and deficient heat disorders, largely because in winter, people huddle by fires and consume hot foods, causing residual phlegm to flow into the limbs. Of those afflicted, no fewer than six or seven in ten suffer thus.\n\nFrom the second month onward, gather a handful each of eastward-growing peach branches and leaves, decoct in three *sheng* of water until reduced to about two *sheng*, and take on an empty stomach at dawn. One need not finish it all—simply inducing vomiting to expel phlegm and rheum from the heart and diaphragm will prevent harm. Practicing this emetic method in all four seasons is far superior to purging, for purging weakens the lower burner with cold, while vomiting expels guest heat from the heart’s palace and cures a hundred diseases. For children, who have not yet engaged in worldly affairs and thus need not fear purging, administer *Yinchen Pills* or *Rhinoceros Horn Pills* to induce it. However, one must carefully assess cold, heat, deficiency, and excess—do not act recklessly.\n\nFor men, purging is sometimes necessary to eliminate beriberi surging to the heart, cold pain in the bladder with pus and water, or blockages in the Triple Burner. Regular purging ensures smooth flow, but avoid excessive purgation. Purging is especially forbidden in summer, as it depletes yin qi. Men over forty should not undergo harsh purging.\n\nAs spring deepens, gradually adopt a gentler regimen. Delay removing padded clothing, and never let the back grow cold—cold injures the lungs, causing nasal congestion and coughing. If warmth is felt, remove layers; if slight cold is sensed, add them—this is most effective. The *Feishu* (Lung Transport) point governs the exterior of the five viscera, and the *Weishu* (Stomach Transport) point leads the twelve channels—maintaining the proper balance of cold and heat is paramount.\n\nThe common saying goes: \"Avoid wind as you would an arrow, avoid lust as you would chaos, adjust your clothing with the seasons, and eat lightly after midday.\" These words are truly precious. If deficient heat is felt, regularly take *Red Snow* with meals, and occasionally *Bupleurum Decoction* or *Three Yellows Pills*. *Scrophularia* is excellent for dispelling deficient heat, treating consumption, and brightening the eyes.\n\nBetween spring and autumn lies the season when myriad diseases arise—one must certainly take care.\n\n**Summer Regimen (Fourth)**\nFrom the start of summer through the three *fu* periods, the abdomen tends to be cold, and diarrhea must be especially avoided, as it drains yin qi. In summer, acupuncture and moxibustion are inappropriate—only sweating therapies are suitable. After the Summer Solstice, at midnight, yin begins to emerge; one should consume warming foods and take kidney-tonifying decoctions. Not only should inherently hot foods be eaten, but all meals should be warm. During the *Waxia* season, the heart flourishes while the kidneys wane—this is the prime time for restorative care.\n\nDuring periods of intense heat, one must not consume cold noodles, sesame drinks, rice porridge with honey, or sweetened syrups—eating these when already full will surely induce cholera morbus. Furthermore, raw vegetables and eggplant, which chill the abdomen, when eaten with these heavy, indigestible foods, often form abdominal masses. Those suffering from cold qi or wind disorders must especially avoid them. In summer, regardless of age, one should regularly eat warm foods; by autumn, this will prevent red-and-white dysentery, malaria, and cholera morbus. As long as the abdomen remains warm, no illnesses can arise, for the yang qi is robust and flourishing. Yet people today fail to regulate themselves: they eat their midday meal late and drink tea on an empty stomach. Since the kidneys govern salt, salt draws tea into them, causing deficiency and cold in the lower burner, leading to painful numbness in the hands and feet. Drinking two or three bowls after meals is harmless, but one should not drink more when still hungry. Men with chronic accumulations, the five types of hemorrhoids, wind sores, cold qi, consumptive emaciation, or deficiency depletion, and women with blood disorders or head wind, should particularly avoid tea. Though it aids digestion and dispels drowsiness, drinking it on an empty stomach is truly excessive.\n\nDuring extreme heat, one should sleep in secluded places, never reclining in the open under the stars and moon. One must also avoid having others fan one while asleep. I have often seen people, fearing heat for their newborns, fan them while they sleep and place them in drafty, cold spots—this is excessive love. Yet even those who raise horses well know: if a basket of manure or a trough of urine is left unattended, flies and mosquitoes will swarm, and if not shooed away in time, the horses will startle, injure their heads, and kick their chests. Such care, though well-intentioned, leads to harm—how can one not be cautious? Thus, infants often suffer from umbilical wind, spasms of the hands and feet, and lockjaw, commonly called \"Hu Sun Jin,\" though people do not know its cause and mistakenly attribute it to ghosts or demons. In this, not one in ten thousand is spared.\n\nIn summer, one should not rise late, as it causes lethargy in the limbs and dullness of the spirit. One must not bathe in cold water, for it induces deficient heat, dims the eyes, causes spasms in the sinews and vessels, and leads to cholera morbus with muscle cramps. One should bathe when hungry and wash when full, but never bathe again when hungry, and after bathing, avoid wind. The same applies to young children. When returning from the heat, one must not wash the hands, face, or douse the back with cold water—doing so will surely cause yin jaundice; rinsing the mouth is sufficient. One should not fan oneself excessively or expose the skin, as this often leads to piercing wind or wind rashes. Nor should one drink cold water, as it causes accumulations, qi stagnation, and severe dysentery with undigested food. Raw vegetables, eggplant, and melons are especially harmful; eating them at night is particularly forbidden, though coarse, hardworking people may tolerate them in small amounts. While melons regulate qi, they obscure the eyes—when donkeys and horses eat them, their eyes fester by the next day, a fact too clear to ignore. After eating hot foods and sweating, one should wipe the sweat away and not fan oneself, which is most beneficial.\n\nOne must not eat at night, especially avoiding meat broths, raw or cold foods, and greasy or sticky substances. In summer, nights are short, and the elderly often have cold abdomens; if food is not digested, it frequently causes abdominal distension and cholera morbus. One must not sleep exposed to wind or dampness, for sweat often leaves the body vulnerable, and wind striking it leads to wind impediment, paralysis of the hands and feet, slurred speech, quadriplegia, or hemiplegia. Though not all cases are immediately harmful, some strike at once, while others take effect later. In times of abundant years, under a full moon, or in harmonious weather, one may be fortunate enough to escape harm.\n\nIf one encounters lean years, meets an empty moon, or loses harmonious weather, none will escape affliction.\n\nOnce, there was a family where none lived long, and they came to consult Peng Zu. Peng Zu examined their sleeping quarters and found a hole directly above the headrest. The head is the convergence of the three hundred and sixty yang channels; when pernicious wind blows through it, the yang qi scatters entirely, and over time, death follows. Peng Zu had them seal the hole, and the family indeed lived long thereafter.\n\nThis illustrates that embracing benevolence and upholding righteousness may not show immediate benefit, yet their use arises in due time—this is a metaphor for proper nurturing. Abandoning benevolence and forsaking trust may not show immediate harm, yet their loss comes in time—this is a metaphor for the consequences of failing to regulate and protect. The principles of gain and loss are thus clearly evident.\n\nIn summer, one should not bathe frequently, for excessive bathing weakens the heart, induces forgetfulness, and readily invites wind. Each morning, comb the hair one or two hundred strokes, but avoid scraping the scalp; comb only in windless places, and naturally, wind will be dispelled and vision clarified.\n\n**Autumn Regimen (Fifth Section)**\nAfter the Beginning of Autumn, one should gradually adopt a moderate regimen. The transition between spring and autumn is when old illnesses often flare up, so one must nurture and care for oneself according to one’s nature.\n\nIn autumn, one should not induce vomiting or sweating, as this consumes the body, disturbs the organs, and unsettles the viscera. Acupuncture, moxibustion, and purgative decoctions or powders to assist yang qi are suitable.\n\nIf suffering from chronic fatigue, the five types of hemorrhoids, or wasting-thirst, one should avoid dry rice, roasted meats, beef from animals that died of illness, raw fish slices, chicken, pork, turbid wine, aged or rancid pickles, salty vinegar, sticky or hard-to-digest foods, raw vegetables, melons, fruits, toxic fish, salted fish, and fermented sauces.\n\nThose with wind afflictions, cold diseases, or sores and accumulations should also avoid the above foods.\n\nIf one knows they consumed too many cold foods in summer, and by autumn suffers from red-and-white dysentery or malaria, one should take two *sheng* of boys’ urine, five betel nuts, and *dafupi* (areca husk), finely chopped and simmered to eight *ge*. Add a mouthful of fresh ginger juice and two or three parts of preserved snow, then take on an empty stomach in two divided doses, inducing three to five bowel movements. This will expel the cold foods consumed in summer and any residual water or cold pus in the bladder, preventing illness.\n\nThis decoction, known as *Chengqi Tang* (Qi-Regulating Decoction), is suitable even for the elderly, as it neither depletes strength nor weakens the body. Moreover, autumn is the proper season for purgation. This decoction treats beriberi and various qi disorders, and its formula is highly effective, hence its inclusion here.\n\nAfter a man has had diarrhea for three to five days, he should eat *yuebai* porridge with sheep kidney on an empty stomach, which is far superior to taking any tonic medicine.\n\nEach morning upon waking, close the eyes, click the teeth twenty-one times, swallow saliva, rub the palms together until warm, and press them over the eyes. The more repetitions, the better. This method dispels wind and brightens the eyes, with no equal.\n\n**End of *Hunsu Yisheng Lu*, Volume One**\n\n**Winter Regimen (Sixth Section)**\nIn winter, yang lies concealed and begins to stir within; if there is internal illness, purging is appropriate. With heat often accumulating in the heart and diaphragm, sweating is especially forbidden, lest yang qi be drained.\n\nOne should take medicated wines and tonics to welcome the return of yang qi. When resting, one should slightly reduce activity, though this is a general guideline. For chronic illnesses, one must adjust according to individual circumstances.\n\nWinter clothing should be donned late and gradually thickened, avoiding sudden warmth—this is the subtlety of proper nurturing. One should not allow heat to accumulate excessively; merely avoiding cold suffices.\n\nIn severe cold, one should not frequently warm oneself by the fire, as this greatly harms the body. The hands and feet correspond to the heart; excessive warming of the hands draws fire qi inward, causing internal heat and restlessness. The heat from warm foods and fire’s warmth accumulates in the heart, for the heart belongs to fire.\n\nCold medicines cannot cure extreme heat, nor can hot medicines cure extreme cold, for water flows to the damp and fire seeks the dry. When taking medicine, first examine the viscera for deficiencies, then supplement where there is damage—this always proves effective. Most people take medicines that do not suit them because their constitutions differ.\n\nOne should not warm clothes by the fire before wearing them, as this also harms the body.\n\nAt the transition between spring and summer, when yin qi has entered but yang qi is not properly regulated, it flows into the four limbs, giving rise to seasonal febrile illnesses, and in severe cases, manic behavior and delirium. If cold medicines are taken immediately, only two or three out of ten may survive, and even then, they often suffer from contractures, blindness, hair loss, or sores and scabies.\n\nBoth yin and yang toxins—of which *shanghan* (cold damage) is a subtype of epidemic illnesses—have specific treatments, with no alternative methods. They can be cured within seven days, but not beyond; such is the evidence. How can the use of medicine afford error?\n\nUpon recognizing this illness, one should not hastily take cold medicines. If it is yang toxin, there is a chance of recovery; but if it is true yin toxin, taking cold medicine will lead to immediate distress. One must carefully discern and not act carelessly.\n\nBathing daily promotes the circulation of blood and qi, harmonizing the interstices. Before bathing, eat to fullness, bathe at night, then drink one or two cups of wine and sleep, avoiding drafts. A night of peaceful rest is essential, and sexual activity is strictly forbidden—this benefits one in the long term.\n\nAfter meals, take fine *hongxue* (red snow) or *Sanhuan Wan* (Three Yellows Pill) for better results.\n\nIn matters of diet, those over forty should slightly favor warmth, while those under forty should slightly favor coolness. If one has preexisting conditions, adjust within the bounds of cold and warmth as appropriate.\n\nIn winter, when using warm bedding such as quilts or felt pads, remove them when too hot and add them when the cold congeals.\n\nAs the proverb says: \"Taking medicine is not as good as frequently adjusting one's clothing.\" How true these words are. For all illnesses, one must strictly avoid consuming hot meat, wine, dairy, roasted or grilled foods, as excessive intake causes stagnation in the blood and qi. Even in ordinary times, one should not eat *jiaozi* or *huntun* piping hot. If hot foods are consumed in winter, by late spring or early summer, one will surely suffer from boils or epidemics.\n\n**On the Regulation of Consumptive Illnesses (Section Seven)**\nMen afflicted with chronic overwork, the five types of hemorrhoids, wasting-thirst, or cold in the lower burner ascending to the upper diaphragm—most often suffer due to immoderate diet and desires. Moreover, in men, the lower burner begins to decline after forty, while in women, the upper burner weakens first. Consumptive illnesses arise from two extremes: neither should one lift heavy weights nor remain idle all day. Yet it is those of leisure who most often suffer from this malady. The idle do not exert themselves physically, and after eating their fill, they do not walk much, sitting instead at their whim. This causes the meridians to stagnate and the blood to congeal.\n\nThus, the noble appear joyful but labor in mind, while the humble are at ease in heart though their appearance is worn. The noble, driven by ceaseless desires and ignorant of prohibitions, indulge in rich delicacies before retiring—this is how such ailments arise. Extending this principle, one sees the pattern clearly.\n\nPeople must exert themselves regularly, but not to the point of exhaustion. This ensures the smooth flow of *ying* and *wei*, the circulation of blood and qi throughout the body—like a door hinge that never rots. This is the essential secret of health maintenance, a truth more precious than gold.\n\nWhen one first contracts a consumptive illness, the symptoms are many yet often go unnoticed in daily life. Here, they are briefly outlined for careful examination. The signs include: dimness in both eyes, heat in the palms and soles, oppression and fatigue in the back and shoulders, soreness in the neck, weakness in the limbs, occasional redness in the cheeks and lips, dark and scanty urine, softness and weakness in the hands and feet (unable to stand for long), poor appetite yet cravings for unusual foods, inability to eat much, lumps or distension in the flanks, constant cold in the abdomen, undigested food, empty heat above the diaphragm, frequent coughing, thick and sticky sputum, excessive sweating, and frequent urination—resembling one feigning illness. Some experience intermittent fevers, worse at night than by day, restlessness in the bones and joints, severe forgetfulness, and dry, cracked lips. All these are symptoms of consumptive illness.\n\nUpon noticing such signs, one must seek remedies, take medicine, moderate desires, and regulate diet and breathing—hoping for gradual recovery. If one remains unaware and does not encounter a skilled physician to diagnose the condition and prescribe treatment, the illness will deepen over time. The chest bones will protrude, the flesh on the arms waste away, coughing will silence the voice, and breathing will require raised shoulders. The sputum will resemble fermented bean paste or rotted intestines—by then, the five viscera are damaged, and even the most sagacious physician cannot save them.\n\nIf such symptoms appear, avoid consuming stale, hard-to-digest, or rancid foods, as well as dog meat, parrot, pork, wild fox, mutton, camel, beef, horse, roasted meats, and raw or cold foods. Also, abstain from sexual activity.\n\nIn ancient times, Xu You found even the movement of a single gourd bothersome. How much more so for those who rise at dawn and chase fame and profit all day, entangled by desires and scheming—naturally, their spirit scatters and their body labors. How can they avoid illness? Upon noticing such symptoms, one should eat cooked rice, congee made with ginger and fermented soybean juice, as well as wolfberry, chrysanthemum, beef shank, leeks, rehmannia, purslane, crucian carp, whitefish, dried venison, and lean boiled mutton. All other foods should be avoided until recovery, after which one may eat freely.\n\n**On the Regulation of Wind Illnesses (Section Eight)**\nThose suffering from chronic wind illnesses are difficult to treat. In such cases, the marrow is depleted and the flesh porous, allowing wind to penetrate the bones, causing paralysis of the limbs and joints due to bone depletion and blood deficiency.\n\nThe causes are varied: some sleep in the wind after being chilled in summer, others fan themselves after drinking, or indulge in toxic fish or pork. Moreover, the Jianghuai region is damp and low-lying, and in summer, the oppressive heat and stagnant wind often breed this illness. Women, who walk little and sit idly after meals, are especially prone to blockages.\n\nWhen the illness first strikes, the symptoms are unstable: some drool in their sleep, their hands and feet tremble, or their bowels become sluggish. Others experience heaviness and pain in the knees, numbness in the limbs, dry eyes, muscle spasms, or uncontrollable sneezing. The skin may itch, the face appear pale and swollen, the eyes dull, and phlegm may be coughed up excessively. Dizziness and vertigo may also occur. All these are signs of wind stroke.\n\nOne should first take this minor decoction, then proceed to stronger medicinal brews. Treatment must be gradual, not rushed—slow progress is easier to cure, while haste makes recovery difficult. Superior medicines, over one hundred and twenty in number, are mild and harmonious, gradually healing the illness.\n\nYet today’s mediocre physicians, ignorant of medicinal properties and pulse diagnosis, fail to apply wisdom and reflection. They seek only immediate results, and if a temporary effect is seen, the patient deems them skilled. However, the proper method of healing requires precise pulse diagnosis, understanding of the five phases, and careful consideration of cold and heat in prescribing medicine. Above all, a physician must act with wisdom and compassion, disregarding wealth or status, and focus solely on saving lives.\n\nSuch a physician is guarded by unseen forces, and their treatments will invariably succeed. Among illnesses, some strike suddenly and require immediate relief—such as throat obstruction, beriberi attacking the heart, yin-yang toxin, cold damage, acute consumption, carbuncles on the back, severe childhood malnutrition, breast abscesses, sudden abdominal pain, or acute heart and stomach pain—these demand prompt results.\n\nFor all other ailments, gradual recovery must be pursued. Those afflicted with wind disorders, when supported by attendants, require meticulous regulation of diet, decoctions, and medicines. Meals should be frequent but not filling—satiety leads to stagnation, while hunger invites deficiency, and deficiency exacerbates wind. Eat when slightly hungry, and cease when nearly full. If the condition persists for years, medication must not be interrupted even briefly; medicinal wines, decoctions, and powders are particularly suitable, and full recovery may be achieved in time. Yet if one trusts an incompetent physician—whose remedies defy principle and whose prohibitions are excessive—the patient will instead suffer from vacuity and pathogenic influences, worsening the condition. Between vacuity and repletion, careful regulation of breathing is essential. How can one not exert diligence?\n\nThose with wind disorders should remain lean and avoid overeating, for their condition will then recede; if they indulge in rich fare and delight in plumpness, the disorder will only intensify. This must be carefully considered. Patients should avoid anger, irregular meals that strain the stomach, extremes of cold and heat, physical and mental exertion, as well as excessive joy, sorrow, anxiety, or fright—all of which are harmful. Those with wind disorders are especially prone to vacuity, and vacuity demands supplementation; yet supplementation may cause stagnation, leading to dizziness, heart oppression, and qi surging upward. Thus, the bowels should be kept unobstructed. Over-purging, however, also induces vacuity, which in turn causes dizziness and visual blurring. In convalescence, one must be especially cautious.\n\nWhen taking supplementing medicines, if the bowels remain unobstructed, there is no need for further purgative or laxative remedies. Those with wind disorders should consume mutton, removing its fat and blood. If vacuity requires it, mutton should be prepared according to proper methods. Sheep graze on myriad grasses, and grasses themselves are non-toxic; by discarding fat and blood and boiling the meat with medicines, it will not provoke illness.\n\n**Method for Boiling Mutton:**\nTake one sheep’s trotter, slit it open with a knife, soak and rinse to remove blood, and trim away the fat. Add one *liang* of *fangfeng* (Saposhnikovia root), five *liang* of *shigao* (gypsum), and two *liang* of *sanggen baipi* (white mulberry root bark), all sliced, and boil together. This does not impair the meat’s flavor and is highly beneficial.\n\nIn summer, one may use fifty fresh mulberry leaves alone, omitting other medicines. Mulberry leaves should be harvested in season, dried in the sun, and stored for winter use. For dried leaves, increase the quantity to eighty. When preparing medicinal decoctions, adjust the amount of meat proportionally.\n\nFor those afflicted with wind disorders, it is inadvisable to consume buckwheat, *song* greens, hot *duoluo* cakes, wontons, sesame oil, sesame cakes, fatty lamp oil, roasted meat, hot plain broth, poorly cooked or raw oily foods, pork, dog meat, raw carp in broth, raw scallions and garlic, or tea on an empty stomach. These should not be eaten.\n\nThe rest may be adjusted according to circumstances, for it is impossible to enumerate every detail.\n\n**Section Nine: Household Adjustments**\nThe greatest afflictions of human life arise from cravings and dietary excesses. Myriad diseases transform and spread, eroding one’s years—all stemming from this gradual corrosion.\n\nThus, the Daoist prohibitions seek not to sever entirely but to curtail extremes. As the saying goes: the *shi* (Master) exceeds, the *shang* (Merchant) falls short—neither attains the mean. Yet how far apart are excess and deficiency?\n\nIf one already suffers from chronic illness, some conditions may be remedied through diet, while others through restraint. Yet the harm or benefit to the body goes unnoticed in daily life.\n\nThe superior person, unconfused, secures life and destiny, minimizing thoughts and distancing from sensual pleasures, moderating diet and rejecting extravagance. The average person may still fail to curb extremes, while the inferior person indulges their nature, ignorant of prohibitions, lusting after beauty and wealth, corrupting their primal harmonious *qi*. Thus, the great majority inevitably suffer erosion—how could it be otherwise?\n\nAs the body declines, limbs wither and contract, chronic ailments take root and resist cure. Having neglected self-care and lacking skilled physicians, when such a state is reached, even the finest delicacies and beauties placed before them can no longer command a moment’s regard.\n\nHow much better to practice restraint, persist without weariness, and find contentment in a joyful heart and pleasing sights! Is this not wisdom?\n\nHeaven and earth intermingle their vapors, and the myriad things transform in purity. Through the union of male and female, the myriad things come to life—this is the root of human life, the origin of nurturing destiny.\n\nYet most dismiss it as baseless, calling it crude. Before twenty, recovery occurs in hours; before thirty, in days; after forty, in months; after fifty, in three months; after sixty, in seven months.\n\nThe *Daoist Canon* states: *\"At sixty, close the door.\"* This warns that those negligent in cultivating their nature will suffer harm before illness even arises. Yet even with this caution, many still fall ill.\n\nAlas! Most people fail to nurture their primal harmonious *qi* or preserve their form. Recklessly consuming cinnabar and other elixirs to fuel desires and excess, their spirit and soul detach from the body, wandering lost. Essence and vitality both perish, leaving only a hollow husk, all purpose forgotten.\n\nSome abandon their practice unfinished; others fail to begin. Their lives drift aimlessly, their bodies ravaged by illness. They rise at night unable to rest, enduring hardship through the years—all because they do not understand their nature and blindly follow vulgar passions.\n\nObserve the world: fewer than one or two in ten still have their mothers living; fewer than one or two in ten still have their fathers. Judging by this, most are deluded by desires, stumbling over their own lives—truly a cause for sorrow.\n\n**Section Ten: Prohibitions and Adjustments**\n\nAt all times of secluded union, avoid the following: when heaven and earth are dark and dim, when the sun and moon are eclipsed, during fierce winds and heavy rains, when thunder and lightning rage, on the four seasons’ turning points and the eight solar terms, on the crescent, full, waning, and new moons, when the sun and moon deviate from their courses, when auspicious clouds arise, when rainbows appear or stars streak across the sky, on one’s own fateful day, on the days of the Demon Star and the Winnowing Basket, on the days of the Six Jia, the Six Ding, the Jiazi, the Gengshen, the Ziwu, the Maoyou, and the days when the yin and yang of the Seven Luminaries are out of balance, or when celestial spirits are on duty.\n\nWhen yin qi prevails and presses upon yang, yang becomes deficient; when yang qi prevails and presses upon yin, yin becomes deficient. When yin is excessive and yang weak, or yang excessive and yin depleted, illness arises from this imbalance.\n\nFurther avoid the following: after drinking to intoxication, before the wine has worn off, after a full meal, when suddenly hungry or overly sated, after coming or going with fatigued sinews, when joy or anger remain unresolved, during a woman’s monthly flow, when exposed to cold or heat, when illness has not yet subsided, when the need to relieve oneself arises, after a recent bath, immediately after relieving oneself, at dawn and the hour of Xu, or when hastily rushing about without inclination—all these leave spirit and qi in disarray, the heart and strength insufficient. If the four limbs are weak and emaciated, the kidneys timid and frail, the six emotions unbalanced, then myriad illnesses will arise from these conditions. All the above must be scrupulously avoided.\n\nAlso avoid sacred mountains and great rivers, divine trees and temple halls, ancient altars and communal shrines, places beneath the stars and moon, before lamps and candles, or in the presence of the six livestock. Engaging in union at such places shortens lifespan, dulls one’s descendants, and must be strictly forbidden.\n\nMoreover, on the sixteenth day of the fifth month, when heaven and earth converge, union is especially forbidden, for it disrupts life’s reckoning, harms the yang path, and may never be restored—those who violate this have been proven to suffer the consequences. Generally, the fifth month is when one’s spirit is shed; the old are diminished, while the young are enhanced. One should retire early, quiet the mind, moderate desires, and harmonize the will to preserve well-being. In summer, the heart flourishes while the kidneys wane; the kidneys transform into water, awaiting autumn to congeal and winter to solidify. Summer demands the utmost care and conservation—this is most essential.\n\nWhen encountering one older than oneself, avoid union in their birth month; even with those slightly older, it is inadvisable, let alone those far senior. Yin exceeding yang greatly harms men, just as yang exceeding yin harms women—this follows the principle of Bo Le appraising horses.\n\nFurther avoid those with thin lips and large noses, sparse teeth and yellow hair, dry skin and painful ailments, discordant temperaments, coarse and stiff pubic hair, harsh voices and rough flesh, ungraceful limbs, stubborn and jealous natures, or many birthmarks—none of these should be engaged with.\n\nThe foregoing outlines the general principles of prohibitions and adjustments. For specific medicinal protections or methods of nurturing life as recorded in other classics, one may refer to their broader guidance.\n\n*Concluding the Lower Scroll of the Record of the Head-Born in the Common World.*",

      "translated_text": "**Preface to the *Record of Nurturing Life While Mingling with the World***\n\nAmong all things between Heaven and Earth, man is the most noble. This nobility sets him apart from the myriad creatures. What man values most is honor and glory; what he treasures most is his nature and life. Born from the essence of Heaven and Earth, shaped by cold, heat, dryness, and dampness, he must harmonize and preserve them—accord brings no pestilence, while discord invites a thousand ailments to converge, even cutting short the span of life itself. Between these extremes lie premature deaths, chronic pains, and afflictions of lameness and blindness, all arising from the missteps of nurturing and care.\n\nYet there are also innate afflictions—extra fingers, dangling growths, and protruding wens—these are the common troubles of birth, not errors of one’s conduct. Thus, the five colors dazzle the eyes, the five tones deafen the ears, the five flavors delight the palate, and the chase of game maddens the heart. To cast aside these four is to become a person beyond the dust of the world.\n\nThose who dwell in deep mountains, abide in remote valleys, befriend apes and monkeys, or herd with deer—abandoning the pleasures of the mortal realm to feed on darkness and dine on mist, seeking to match their longevity to Heaven and Earth—are scarcely one or two in ten thousand. Yet even a slight mastery of moderation in diet and desire spares one from untimely misfortune.\n\nIn my youth, I indulged excessively in rich foods and wine, and illness clung to me. Reflecting on its cause, I saw its roots. Thus, I turned my heart to the Dao, roamed forests and springs, and forgot worldly cares, gradually recovering. Though dull by nature and ignorant of the principles of avoidance and nurture, I have roughly followed these restraints for twenty years and found them effective.\n\nYet life’s span, success, and failure are fixed by fate. If one cannot preserve harmony but instead exhausts the spirit, forging gold and refining cinnabar to fuel desires, abandoning benevolence and righteousness in pursuit of fortune—hoping for eternal life—this is the height of delusion! For if the skin cannot endure, where will the hair cling?\n\nAs for those who cast off worldly ties to ascend emptiness, riding dragons and commanding cranes—these are those who have accumulated hidden virtues life after life, practiced benevolence and righteousness generation after generation, and possess an unyielding nature, their endowment firm and unshaken. Such outcomes are not the work of herbs and elixirs.\n\nAncient records speak of men living hundreds of years, yet none are said to have studied the arts of Dao or sought immortality. Tortoises, dragons, snakes, and cranes have no recipes for consuming fungi or mushrooms. Pine and bamboo endure frost without withering, while creeping vines wither before autumn—these are the natural natures of things. Does the great Dao of Heaven and Earth favor some creatures over others?\n\nWild beasts do not die unless struck by arrows, for they follow their natural inclinations—eating when hungry, drinking when thirsty, indulging desires in due season, without entanglement. Man, however, often dies young or suffers illness, driven by greed for fame and profit, exhausting his spirit, forcing down herbs and elixirs, indulging desires without restraint, ignorant of taboos, indulging in excess, overeating, and glutting himself on warmth. Yet earth, wood, springs, and stones are all shaped by creation, bearing strange and wondrous forms—and man is no different.\n\nMoreover, wealth, rank, and glory are but fleeting moments, matters not of the body’s essence. Only nurturing life and cultivating nature bring tranquility of spirit and extended years.\n\nHere, I set forth ten essential chapters on moderation, titled *Record of Nurturing Life While Mingling with the World*. These methods have been tested and proven, not mere empty words. Though they do not delve into profound study or meticulous refinement, they provide a general outline. I have not recorded every detail in full, but if fellow seekers of the Dao encounter this, may they glean a few insights.\n\n---\n\n**Volume One of *Record of Nurturing Life While Mingling with the World***\n*Compiled by Hermit Liu Ci of Mount Mao*\n\n**1. Moderation in Diet**\n\nFood is the foundation of life and cannot be abandoned even for a moment. Deviating from moderation or neglecting cold and warmth gives rise to illness. Unable to consume elixirs of cinnabar and mist or regulate primordial *qi*, one must instead moderate diet and desires in daily activities—walking, standing, sitting, and resting. This is the finest medicine, yet its daily practice is often overlooked.\n\nOne should eat warm foods before cold. Why? The kidneys belong to Water, and Water’s nature is cold; thus, warm foods warm them first. This principle holds in all seasons, but it is especially beneficial in summer, when hidden *yin* resides within.\n\nAvoid excessive fullness, for it harms the heart, causing shortness of breath and oppression. After eating, rub the abdomen dozens of times and exhale upward twenty times—this greatly aids digestion. Do not lie down immediately after eating, lest it lead to lung *qi* disorders, obstructing circulation and causing blood stasis. Fatigue in the limbs and excessive sleepiness give rise to a hundred illnesses.\n\nAfter eating, one must relax for a while, walk thirty to fifty steps to aid digestion, and wait until the heart and viscera feel empty before lying down. When resting, avoid speaking, singing, or whistling. The five viscera are like bells and chimes—they do not sound unless struck. This is the subtlety of nurturing.\n\nFood assists *qi*, but overeating obstructs its flow. After eating, avoid lying flat, as it often leads to *qi* stagnation and head wind. Do not eat greedily or hastily—haste harms *qi*, while greed harms the spleen. A damaged spleen becomes a source of dietary taxation, one of the five labors of men.\n\nAfter eating, avoid strenuous activity, riding horses, climbing heights, or traversing perilous paths, lest it harm the internal organs. Do not eat at night, for after sunset, the spleen ceases to grind, as all sounds fade away. The spleen delights in music—when strings and bamboo are heard, the spleen grinds, as the *Rites of Zhou* says: \"Music aids the meal.\"",

      "translated_text": "Thus, all sounds and tones are governed by the spleen. If the abdomen is slightly cold, food will not digest, and the stomach will also be harmed. A damaged stomach leads to regurgitation, and regurgitation prevents the reception of grain *qi*. Once grain *qi* is not received, vomiting ensues, and vomiting may turn into the ailment of regurgitating stomach. After nightfall, one should not eat to satiety with meat, noodles, or raw sliced fish. In summer, when nights are short, this is especially to be avoided. Raw fish must not be eaten with dairy products. Though such foods may digest by night’s end, they severely harm the spleen and stomach, causing spleen taxation. Toward nightfall, one should not eat fried cakes to satiety—this is particularly damaging for those prone to wind *qi*.\n\nAfter eating hot foods, do not rinse the mouth with cold water; after eating cold foods, do not rinse with hot water. The clash of cold and heat often leads to toothache and exposed tooth roots. When eating roasted meat, consuming it while hot often causes wind sores, blackened teeth, or gradual tooth decay and loss, while also obstructing the flow of blood and *qi*.\n\nAfter a full meal, one should stand and urinate; when hungry, urinating promptly is most beneficial, lest the bladder be harmed. Greasy foods are particularly unwholesome, as they darken the eyes and cause coldness and slipperiness in the intestines and stomach, often stirring wind. Those suffering from wind sores or *qi* ailments should especially avoid them.\n\nA slight reduction in the five flavors refreshes the spirit, though the *qi* of the kidneys particularly favors salty foods, which also help digest undigested food. Well water should not be consumed in excess, for overindulgence in any one flavor will harm the corresponding organ. Thus, excessive salt harms the sinews and must not be indulged; sweetness harms the stomach, pungency harms the eyes, and bitterness harms the *qi*. Fright harms the *hun*, sorrow harms the spirit, thought harms the intent, indulgence harms the emotions, and resentment harms the will.\n\nProlonged seeing harms vision, prolonged hearing harms acuity, prolonged walking harms the sinews, prolonged lying harms the blood, prolonged labor harms the bones, prolonged standing harms the limbs and joints, and prolonged speech harms *qi*. Do not drink to excess when extremely thirsty, nor eat to satiety when ravenous. Do not indulge in great joy or great sorrow, nor rest excessively after great labor. Desire great gains but not great losses, for anger harms the upright *qi*.\n\nExhaustion from great labor depletes the viscera, great hunger harms the organs, great fullness blocks the interstices, great thirst disrupts the meridians and obstructs *qi*, great drunkenness scatters the spirit, great laughter causes *qi* to fly upward, great fear leaves the heart disoriented, great heat blocks *qi*, great cold congeals the blood, excessive sleep separates the spirit and *hun*, and great fright unsettles the heart. These are all signs of harm to longevity.\n\nOne should always avoid eating animals that have died of themselves, rancid beef that is difficult to digest, overly salty or sour foods that cause dryness and slipperiness, cold and greasy foods, raw scallions, garlic (both large and small), raw coriander, unseasonal foods, melons, fruits, flour porridge, and cold noodles—none of these accord with the Dao of nurturing life and regulating the body.\n\nWhen taking medicinal remedies, one should especially avoid three kinds of meat that lack sufficient *qi*: chicken, pork, and scaleless fish. One should also avoid three kinds of vegetables that lack sufficient vitality: *junda* (Indian lettuce), lettuce, and spinach, as they obstruct the blood.\n\nIf one does not constantly regulate one’s conduct in movement, stillness, sitting, lying, eating, and desires, even consuming lingzhi mushrooms daily or drinking morning dew will be of no benefit. Tonifying medicines that assist yang, if relied upon to maintain fullness, will over time cause great harm—how could this not be foolish?\n\nWhen eating meat or vegetables, if one encounters tough or stringy bits, do not swallow them. These are difficult to digest and, if retained, often form abdominal masses or accumulations, also causing spleen taxation. Furthermore, one must not eat or drink in the presence of stars and moonlight, in temples, monasteries, famous mountains and rivers, ancient altars, sacred trees, or burial grounds—such places are forbidden by Daoists and should be strictly avoided.\n\n**On the Regulation of Drinking Wine**\n\nWine corresponds to the celestial bodies, its origins stretching far back. The wise drink it and become wiser; fools drink it and become more foolish. It dispels sorrow, enlivens the will, vents anger, and emboldens speech—all through this substance. Thus, the ancient kings drank it with ritual and music, the worthy drank it to cultivate their nature, and ordinary people drank it to indulge their desires. Only wine is said to have no fixed measure.\n\nRaising pigs to make wine was not intended to cause misfortune. Therefore, one should not drink to excess or too frequently. Extreme drunkenness severely harms the heart and spirit, causing the liver to float and the gallbladder to become unruly, while also inviting wind and damaging the kidneys, ruining the sinews, and rotting the bones—nothing is more harmful than wine. After a full meal, it is especially to be avoided.\n\nThose who frequently drink wine often suffer from lung *qi* disorders and wind ailments; otherwise, they may experience heaviness in the lower back and knees or cold pain in the bladder—these are all variations of the same harm. After drinking, one should not induce violent vomiting, for this causes the liver to overturn and the gallbladder to deplete. The liver is the gallbladder’s repository; once depleted, the gallbladder withers, and a withered gallbladder leads to timidity. Timidity causes frequent fright and palpitations, restless sleep, and forgetfulness, gradually scattering the heart and spirit. When harm is perceived, one should take heart-tonifying pills.\n\nWhen drinking wine, do not do so hastily, for haste may rupture the lungs. The lungs are the canopy of the five viscera and must not be harmed. If damaged, one will often suffer from nasal discharge, lung *qi* disorders, lung atrophy, and coughing illnesses. Those with consumptive *qi*, wind sores, or the five types of hemorrhoids must strictly avoid wine. For those with wind ailments, wine infused with medicinal herbs should be consumed without becoming extremely drunk.\n\nAfter drinking, do not consume cold water or cold tea, for wine will carry these into the kidney organ, where they become stagnant toxic water that must be expelled. Over time, this often leads to heaviness in the lower back and knees, cold pain in the bladder, water swelling, wasting-thirst, and spasms—all arising from this cause.\n\nAfter drinking, do not lie down immediately; one should move about to prevent the wine from soaking and damaging the bladder and intestines. Observe how the houses of heavy drinkers easily decay—this makes the principle clear. In all seasons, drinking warm wine is best. In winter, it is enough to dispel the cold; it should not be scalding hot, for heat harms the heart and lungs. All foods and drinks should be consumed warm, not just wine.",
      "overlap_context": "y—haste harms *qi*, while greed harms the spleen. A damaged spleen becomes a source of dietary taxation, one of the five labors of men.\n\nAfter eating, avoid strenuous activity, riding horses, climbing heights, or traversing perilous paths, lest it harm the internal organs. Do not eat at night, for after sunset, the spleen ceases to grind, as all sounds fade away. The spleen delights in music—when strings and bamboo are heard, the spleen grinds, as the *Rites of Zhou* says: \"Music aids the meal.\"",

      "translated_text": "In summer, stir-fry black soybeans until hot, then steep them in wine; when the liquid turns purple, drink it warm—its power to regulate qi is unmatched. In autumn and winter, gauge one’s own constitution, whether cold or hot, and infuse wine with appropriate medicinal substances—this is most excellent. Nowadays, people often use grapes or malted wheat for this purpose, but such clever counterfeits disrupt the true remedy and should not be mixed with other ingredients. The ancients valued plain wine and unseasoned broth for their simplicity.\n\nWine, when taken in moderation, is beneficial; in excess, it harms. A little wine guides qi, enhances the efficacy of medicines, moistens the skin, improves complexion, unblocks the channels and collaterals, regulates qi, resists frost, and repels warm pathogens. On an empty stomach, one must never inhale foul or noxious odors or visit the homes of the sick—drinking wine alone can ward off evil toxins. Once, three men ventured out at dawn through the dew: one had eaten his fill, one was fasting, and one had drunk wine. The fasting man died suddenly, the full man fell ill, but the one who drank wine remained healthy.\n\nWine benefits when taken properly, but harms when overindulged. Moreover, as a substance that rots the intestines, it must not be consumed recklessly. Wine’s nature is intensely hot—even in the bitter cold that freezes the sea, only wine does not congeal. When brewing wine, one waits for the wind and tides to stir before proceeding, thereby harmonizing the transformative work of yin and yang. Thus, excessive drinking cools the body.\n\nMen, whose yang qi is often weak, may further deplete themselves by wandering about after drinking or fanning themselves to cool down. This leads to deficiency and damage, and later, wine draws yin qi to congeal in the lower burner. Or, if still intoxicated and parched with thirst, one drinks tea or water, the wine carries these into the waist and knees, where they lodge in the bladder as stagnant toxic water, congealing in the lower burner. Without potent medicines or a skilled physician, this cannot be expelled—hence, drinking to excess cools the body.\n\nIt is commonly seen that in summer, people steep wine in wells, while in winter, they mix it with butter or yogurt—both practices are gravely harmful, inevitably causing cold disorders in the waist and knees. Butter and yogurt in wine trigger consumptive spasms and stir phlegm diseases, which cannot be easily dispelled.\n\nThe reason wine intoxicates is due to its *niè* (fermented lees) nature. When the qi of *niè* dissipates, it all turns to water, which congeals in the waist and knees with no means of expulsion. After drinking, one should not sit outdoors in the wind, expose bare flesh, or fan oneself, for the pores are all open, and wind must not be allowed to enter—if it does, it may cause paralysis of the limbs, wind-induced disorders, or even hemiplegia, all arising from this cause.\n\nConsuming rich delicacies while cold or drinking chilled beverages may bring momentary pleasure, but over time, they invariably lead to harm.\n\n**Spring Regimen (Third)**\nMan mirrors the yin-yang and Five Phases of heaven and earth, and the subtle shifts of the four seasons’ killing qi—even a hair’s breadth of deviation may invite pestilence. Thus, the hands and feet resemble heaven and earth, the blood vessels mirror rivers, hair corresponds to grasses and trees, caution in anger reflects thunder and lightning, the eyes are like the sun and moon, and desires are observed as the sprouting of life. If seasonal qi deviates slightly, many will fall ill with epidemics; reversing the season’s mandate invites pestilence. Examine this closely, and not one case in ten thousand will be missed.\n\nIn spring, sweating, vomiting, and purging therapies, as well as acupuncture and moxibustion, are appropriate. Taking *Continuing Life Decoction* or *Shuyu Pills* is most effective. From the Winter Solstice onward, at midnight, yang begins to emerge—yang qi is exhaled, yin qi is inhaled. Residual heat in the heart and diaphragm clashes with rising yang qi, like two tigers meeting on a narrow path, bound to fight. At the transition between spring and summer, this gives rise to cold damage and deficient heat disorders, largely because in winter, people huddle by fires and consume hot foods, causing residual phlegm to flow into the limbs. Of those afflicted, no fewer than six or seven in ten suffer thus.\n\nFrom the second month onward, gather a handful each of eastward-growing peach branches and leaves, decoct in three *sheng* of water until reduced to about two *sheng*, and take on an empty stomach at dawn. One need not finish it all—simply inducing vomiting to expel phlegm and rheum from the heart and diaphragm will prevent harm. Practicing this emetic method in all four seasons is far superior to purging, for purging weakens the lower burner with cold, while vomiting expels guest heat from the heart’s palace and cures a hundred diseases. For children, who have not yet engaged in worldly affairs and thus need not fear purging, administer *Yinchen Pills* or *Rhinoceros Horn Pills* to induce it. However, one must carefully assess cold, heat, deficiency, and excess—do not act recklessly.\n\nFor men, purging is sometimes necessary to eliminate beriberi surging to the heart, cold pain in the bladder with pus and water, or blockages in the Triple Burner. Regular purging ensures smooth flow, but avoid excessive purgation. Purging is especially forbidden in summer, as it depletes yin qi. Men over forty should not undergo harsh purging.\n\nAs spring deepens, gradually adopt a gentler regimen. Delay removing padded clothing, and never let the back grow cold—cold injures the lungs, causing nasal congestion and coughing. If warmth is felt, remove layers; if slight cold is sensed, add them—this is most effective. The *Feishu* (Lung Transport) point governs the exterior of the five viscera, and the *Weishu* (Stomach Transport) point leads the twelve channels—maintaining the proper balance of cold and heat is paramount.\n\nThe common saying goes: \"Avoid wind as you would an arrow, avoid lust as you would chaos, adjust your clothing with the seasons, and eat lightly after midday.\" These words are truly precious. If deficient heat is felt, regularly take *Red Snow* with meals, and occasionally *Bupleurum Decoction* or *Three Yellows Pills*. *Scrophularia* is excellent for dispelling deficient heat, treating consumption, and brightening the eyes.\n\nBetween spring and autumn lies the season when myriad diseases arise—one must certainly take care.\n\n**Summer Regimen (Fourth)**\nFrom the start of summer through the three *fu* periods, the abdomen tends to be cold, and diarrhea must be especially avoided, as it drains yin qi. In summer, acupuncture and moxibustion are inappropriate—only sweating therapies are suitable. After the Summer Solstice, at midnight, yin begins to emerge; one should consume warming foods and take kidney-tonifying decoctions. Not only should inherently hot foods be eaten, but all meals should be warm. During the *Waxia* season, the heart flourishes while the kidneys wane—this is the prime time for restorative care.",

      "translated_text": "During periods of intense heat, one must not consume cold noodles, sesame drinks, rice porridge with honey, or sweetened syrups—eating these when already full will surely induce cholera morbus. Furthermore, raw vegetables and eggplant, which chill the abdomen, when eaten with these heavy, indigestible foods, often form abdominal masses. Those suffering from cold qi or wind disorders must especially avoid them. In summer, regardless of age, one should regularly eat warm foods; by autumn, this will prevent red-and-white dysentery, malaria, and cholera morbus. As long as the abdomen remains warm, no illnesses can arise, for the yang qi is robust and flourishing. Yet people today fail to regulate themselves: they eat their midday meal late and drink tea on an empty stomach. Since the kidneys govern salt, salt draws tea into them, causing deficiency and cold in the lower burner, leading to painful numbness in the hands and feet. Drinking two or three bowls after meals is harmless, but one should not drink more when still hungry. Men with chronic accumulations, the five types of hemorrhoids, wind sores, cold qi, consumptive emaciation, or deficiency depletion, and women with blood disorders or head wind, should particularly avoid tea. Though it aids digestion and dispels drowsiness, drinking it on an empty stomach is truly excessive.\n\nDuring extreme heat, one should sleep in secluded places, never reclining in the open under the stars and moon. One must also avoid having others fan one while asleep. I have often seen people, fearing heat for their newborns, fan them while they sleep and place them in drafty, cold spots—this is excessive love. Yet even those who raise horses well know: if a basket of manure or a trough of urine is left unattended, flies and mosquitoes will swarm, and if not shooed away in time, the horses will startle, injure their heads, and kick their chests. Such care, though well-intentioned, leads to harm—how can one not be cautious? Thus, infants often suffer from umbilical wind, spasms of the hands and feet, and lockjaw, commonly called \"Hu Sun Jin,\" though people do not know its cause and mistakenly attribute it to ghosts or demons. In this, not one in ten thousand is spared.\n\nIn summer, one should not rise late, as it causes lethargy in the limbs and dullness of the spirit. One must not bathe in cold water, for it induces deficient heat, dims the eyes, causes spasms in the sinews and vessels, and leads to cholera morbus with muscle cramps. One should bathe when hungry and wash when full, but never bathe again when hungry, and after bathing, avoid wind. The same applies to young children. When returning from the heat, one must not wash the hands, face, or douse the back with cold water—doing so will surely cause yin jaundice; rinsing the mouth is sufficient. One should not fan oneself excessively or expose the skin, as this often leads to piercing wind or wind rashes. Nor should one drink cold water, as it causes accumulations, qi stagnation, and severe dysentery with undigested food. Raw vegetables, eggplant, and melons are especially harmful; eating them at night is particularly forbidden, though coarse, hardworking people may tolerate them in small amounts. While melons regulate qi, they obscure the eyes—when donkeys and horses eat them, their eyes fester by the next day, a fact too clear to ignore. After eating hot foods and sweating, one should wipe the sweat away and not fan oneself, which is most beneficial.\n\nOne must not eat at night, especially avoiding meat broths, raw or cold foods, and greasy or sticky substances. In summer, nights are short, and the elderly often have cold abdomens; if food is not digested, it frequently causes abdominal distension and cholera morbus. One must not sleep exposed to wind or dampness, for sweat often leaves the body vulnerable, and wind striking it leads to wind impediment, paralysis of the hands and feet, slurred speech, quadriplegia, or hemiplegia. Though not all cases are immediately harmful, some strike at once, while others take effect later. In times of abundant years, under a full moon, or in harmonious weather, one may be fortunate enough to escape harm.",

      "translated_text": "If one encounters lean years, meets an empty moon, or loses harmonious weather, none will escape affliction.\n\nOnce, there was a family where none lived long, and they came to consult Peng Zu. Peng Zu examined their sleeping quarters and found a hole directly above the headrest. The head is the convergence of the three hundred and sixty yang channels; when pernicious wind blows through it, the yang qi scatters entirely, and over time, death follows. Peng Zu had them seal the hole, and the family indeed lived long thereafter.\n\nThis illustrates that embracing benevolence and upholding righteousness may not show immediate benefit, yet their use arises in due time—this is a metaphor for proper nurturing. Abandoning benevolence and forsaking trust may not show immediate harm, yet their loss comes in time—this is a metaphor for the consequences of failing to regulate and protect. The principles of gain and loss are thus clearly evident.\n\nIn summer, one should not bathe frequently, for excessive bathing weakens the heart, induces forgetfulness, and readily invites wind. Each morning, comb the hair one or two hundred strokes, but avoid scraping the scalp; comb only in windless places, and naturally, wind will be dispelled and vision clarified.\n\n**Autumn Regimen (Fifth Section)**\nAfter the Beginning of Autumn, one should gradually adopt a moderate regimen. The transition between spring and autumn is when old illnesses often flare up, so one must nurture and care for oneself according to one’s nature.\n\nIn autumn, one should not induce vomiting or sweating, as this consumes the body, disturbs the organs, and unsettles the viscera. Acupuncture, moxibustion, and purgative decoctions or powders to assist yang qi are suitable.\n\nIf suffering from chronic fatigue, the five types of hemorrhoids, or wasting-thirst, one should avoid dry rice, roasted meats, beef from animals that died of illness, raw fish slices, chicken, pork, turbid wine, aged or rancid pickles, salty vinegar, sticky or hard-to-digest foods, raw vegetables, melons, fruits, toxic fish, salted fish, and fermented sauces.\n\nThose with wind afflictions, cold diseases, or sores and accumulations should also avoid the above foods.\n\nIf one knows they consumed too many cold foods in summer, and by autumn suffers from red-and-white dysentery or malaria, one should take two *sheng* of boys’ urine, five betel nuts, and *dafupi* (areca husk), finely chopped and simmered to eight *ge*. Add a mouthful of fresh ginger juice and two or three parts of preserved snow, then take on an empty stomach in two divided doses, inducing three to five bowel movements. This will expel the cold foods consumed in summer and any residual water or cold pus in the bladder, preventing illness.\n\nThis decoction, known as *Chengqi Tang* (Qi-Regulating Decoction), is suitable even for the elderly, as it neither depletes strength nor weakens the body. Moreover, autumn is the proper season for purgation. This decoction treats beriberi and various qi disorders, and its formula is highly effective, hence its inclusion here.\n\nAfter a man has had diarrhea for three to five days, he should eat *yuebai* porridge with sheep kidney on an empty stomach, which is far superior to taking any tonic medicine.\n\nEach morning upon waking, close the eyes, click the teeth twenty-one times, swallow saliva, rub the palms together until warm, and press them over the eyes. The more repetitions, the better. This method dispels wind and brightens the eyes, with no equal.\n\n**End of *Hunsu Yisheng Lu*, Volume One**\n\n**Winter Regimen (Sixth Section)**\nIn winter, yang lies concealed and begins to stir within; if there is internal illness, purging is appropriate. With heat often accumulating in the heart and diaphragm, sweating is especially forbidden, lest yang qi be drained.\n\nOne should take medicated wines and tonics to welcome the return of yang qi. When resting, one should slightly reduce activity, though this is a general guideline. For chronic illnesses, one must adjust according to individual circumstances.\n\nWinter clothing should be donned late and gradually thickened, avoiding sudden warmth—this is the subtlety of proper nurturing. One should not allow heat to accumulate excessively; merely avoiding cold suffices.\n\nIn severe cold, one should not frequently warm oneself by the fire, as this greatly harms the body. The hands and feet correspond to the heart; excessive warming of the hands draws fire qi inward, causing internal heat and restlessness. The heat from warm foods and fire’s warmth accumulates in the heart, for the heart belongs to fire.\n\nCold medicines cannot cure extreme heat, nor can hot medicines cure extreme cold, for water flows to the damp and fire seeks the dry. When taking medicine, first examine the viscera for deficiencies, then supplement where there is damage—this always proves effective. Most people take medicines that do not suit them because their constitutions differ.\n\nOne should not warm clothes by the fire before wearing them, as this also harms the body.\n\nAt the transition between spring and summer, when yin qi has entered but yang qi is not properly regulated, it flows into the four limbs, giving rise to seasonal febrile illnesses, and in severe cases, manic behavior and delirium. If cold medicines are taken immediately, only two or three out of ten may survive, and even then, they often suffer from contractures, blindness, hair loss, or sores and scabies.\n\nBoth yin and yang toxins—of which *shanghan* (cold damage) is a subtype of epidemic illnesses—have specific treatments, with no alternative methods. They can be cured within seven days, but not beyond; such is the evidence. How can the use of medicine afford error?\n\nUpon recognizing this illness, one should not hastily take cold medicines. If it is yang toxin, there is a chance of recovery; but if it is true yin toxin, taking cold medicine will lead to immediate distress. One must carefully discern and not act carelessly.\n\nBathing daily promotes the circulation of blood and qi, harmonizing the interstices. Before bathing, eat to fullness, bathe at night, then drink one or two cups of wine and sleep, avoiding drafts. A night of peaceful rest is essential, and sexual activity is strictly forbidden—this benefits one in the long term.\n\nAfter meals, take fine *hongxue* (red snow) or *Sanhuan Wan* (Three Yellows Pill) for better results.\n\nIn matters of diet, those over forty should slightly favor warmth, while those under forty should slightly favor coolness. If one has preexisting conditions, adjust within the bounds of cold and warmth as appropriate.\n\nIn winter, when using warm bedding such as quilts or felt pads, remove them when too hot and add them when the cold congeals.",

      "translated_text": "As the proverb says: \"Taking medicine is not as good as frequently adjusting one's clothing.\" How true these words are. For all illnesses, one must strictly avoid consuming hot meat, wine, dairy, roasted or grilled foods, as excessive intake causes stagnation in the blood and qi. Even in ordinary times, one should not eat *jiaozi* or *huntun* piping hot. If hot foods are consumed in winter, by late spring or early summer, one will surely suffer from boils or epidemics.\n\n**On the Regulation of Consumptive Illnesses (Section Seven)**\nMen afflicted with chronic overwork, the five types of hemorrhoids, wasting-thirst, or cold in the lower burner ascending to the upper diaphragm—most often suffer due to immoderate diet and desires. Moreover, in men, the lower burner begins to decline after forty, while in women, the upper burner weakens first. Consumptive illnesses arise from two extremes: neither should one lift heavy weights nor remain idle all day. Yet it is those of leisure who most often suffer from this malady. The idle do not exert themselves physically, and after eating their fill, they do not walk much, sitting instead at their whim. This causes the meridians to stagnate and the blood to congeal.\n\nThus, the noble appear joyful but labor in mind, while the humble are at ease in heart though their appearance is worn. The noble, driven by ceaseless desires and ignorant of prohibitions, indulge in rich delicacies before retiring—this is how such ailments arise. Extending this principle, one sees the pattern clearly.\n\nPeople must exert themselves regularly, but not to the point of exhaustion. This ensures the smooth flow of *ying* and *wei*, the circulation of blood and qi throughout the body—like a door hinge that never rots. This is the essential secret of health maintenance, a truth more precious than gold.\n\nWhen one first contracts a consumptive illness, the symptoms are many yet often go unnoticed in daily life. Here, they are briefly outlined for careful examination. The signs include: dimness in both eyes, heat in the palms and soles, oppression and fatigue in the back and shoulders, soreness in the neck, weakness in the limbs, occasional redness in the cheeks and lips, dark and scanty urine, softness and weakness in the hands and feet (unable to stand for long), poor appetite yet cravings for unusual foods, inability to eat much, lumps or distension in the flanks, constant cold in the abdomen, undigested food, empty heat above the diaphragm, frequent coughing, thick and sticky sputum, excessive sweating, and frequent urination—resembling one feigning illness. Some experience intermittent fevers, worse at night than by day, restlessness in the bones and joints, severe forgetfulness, and dry, cracked lips. All these are symptoms of consumptive illness.\n\nUpon noticing such signs, one must seek remedies, take medicine, moderate desires, and regulate diet and breathing—hoping for gradual recovery. If one remains unaware and does not encounter a skilled physician to diagnose the condition and prescribe treatment, the illness will deepen over time. The chest bones will protrude, the flesh on the arms waste away, coughing will silence the voice, and breathing will require raised shoulders. The sputum will resemble fermented bean paste or rotted intestines—by then, the five viscera are damaged, and even the most sagacious physician cannot save them.\n\nIf such symptoms appear, avoid consuming stale, hard-to-digest, or rancid foods, as well as dog meat, parrot, pork, wild fox, mutton, camel, beef, horse, roasted meats, and raw or cold foods. Also, abstain from sexual activity.\n\nIn ancient times, Xu You found even the movement of a single gourd bothersome. How much more so for those who rise at dawn and chase fame and profit all day, entangled by desires and scheming—naturally, their spirit scatters and their body labors. How can they avoid illness? Upon noticing such symptoms, one should eat cooked rice, congee made with ginger and fermented soybean juice, as well as wolfberry, chrysanthemum, beef shank, leeks, rehmannia, purslane, crucian carp, whitefish, dried venison, and lean boiled mutton. All other foods should be avoided until recovery, after which one may eat freely.\n\n**On the Regulation of Wind Illnesses (Section Eight)**\nThose suffering from chronic wind illnesses are difficult to treat. In such cases, the marrow is depleted and the flesh porous, allowing wind to penetrate the bones, causing paralysis of the limbs and joints due to bone depletion and blood deficiency.\n\nThe causes are varied: some sleep in the wind after being chilled in summer, others fan themselves after drinking, or indulge in toxic fish or pork. Moreover, the Jianghuai region is damp and low-lying, and in summer, the oppressive heat and stagnant wind often breed this illness. Women, who walk little and sit idly after meals, are especially prone to blockages.\n\nWhen the illness first strikes, the symptoms are unstable: some drool in their sleep, their hands and feet tremble, or their bowels become sluggish. Others experience heaviness and pain in the knees, numbness in the limbs, dry eyes, muscle spasms, or uncontrollable sneezing. The skin may itch, the face appear pale and swollen, the eyes dull, and phlegm may be coughed up excessively. Dizziness and vertigo may also occur. All these are signs of wind stroke.\n\nOne should first take this minor decoction, then proceed to stronger medicinal brews. Treatment must be gradual, not rushed—slow progress is easier to cure, while haste makes recovery difficult. Superior medicines, over one hundred and twenty in number, are mild and harmonious, gradually healing the illness.\n\nYet today’s mediocre physicians, ignorant of medicinal properties and pulse diagnosis, fail to apply wisdom and reflection. They seek only immediate results, and if a temporary effect is seen, the patient deems them skilled. However, the proper method of healing requires precise pulse diagnosis, understanding of the five phases, and careful consideration of cold and heat in prescribing medicine. Above all, a physician must act with wisdom and compassion, disregarding wealth or status, and focus solely on saving lives.\n\nSuch a physician is guarded by unseen forces, and their treatments will invariably succeed. Among illnesses, some strike suddenly and require immediate relief—such as throat obstruction, beriberi attacking the heart, yin-yang toxin, cold damage, acute consumption, carbuncles on the back, severe childhood malnutrition, breast abscesses, sudden abdominal pain, or acute heart and stomach pain—these demand prompt results.",

      "translated_text": "For all other ailments, gradual recovery must be pursued. Those afflicted with wind disorders, when supported by attendants, require meticulous regulation of diet, decoctions, and medicines. Meals should be frequent but not filling—satiety leads to stagnation, while hunger invites deficiency, and deficiency exacerbates wind. Eat when slightly hungry, and cease when nearly full. If the condition persists for years, medication must not be interrupted even briefly; medicinal wines, decoctions, and powders are particularly suitable, and full recovery may be achieved in time. Yet if one trusts an incompetent physician—whose remedies defy principle and whose prohibitions are excessive—the patient will instead suffer from vacuity and pathogenic influences, worsening the condition. Between vacuity and repletion, careful regulation of breathing is essential. How can one not exert diligence?\n\nThose with wind disorders should remain lean and avoid overeating, for their condition will then recede; if they indulge in rich fare and delight in plumpness, the disorder will only intensify. This must be carefully considered. Patients should avoid anger, irregular meals that strain the stomach, extremes of cold and heat, physical and mental exertion, as well as excessive joy, sorrow, anxiety, or fright—all of which are harmful. Those with wind disorders are especially prone to vacuity, and vacuity demands supplementation; yet supplementation may cause stagnation, leading to dizziness, heart oppression, and qi surging upward. Thus, the bowels should be kept unobstructed. Over-purging, however, also induces vacuity, which in turn causes dizziness and visual blurring. In convalescence, one must be especially cautious.\n\nWhen taking supplementing medicines, if the bowels remain unobstructed, there is no need for further purgative or laxative remedies. Those with wind disorders should consume mutton, removing its fat and blood. If vacuity requires it, mutton should be prepared according to proper methods. Sheep graze on myriad grasses, and grasses themselves are non-toxic; by discarding fat and blood and boiling the meat with medicines, it will not provoke illness.\n\n**Method for Boiling Mutton:**\nTake one sheep’s trotter, slit it open with a knife, soak and rinse to remove blood, and trim away the fat. Add one *liang* of *fangfeng* (Saposhnikovia root), five *liang* of *shigao* (gypsum), and two *liang* of *sanggen baipi* (white mulberry root bark), all sliced, and boil together. This does not impair the meat’s flavor and is highly beneficial.\n\nIn summer, one may use fifty fresh mulberry leaves alone, omitting other medicines. Mulberry leaves should be harvested in season, dried in the sun, and stored for winter use. For dried leaves, increase the quantity to eighty.

These should not be eaten.\n\nThe rest may be adjusted according to circumstances, for it is impossible to enumerate every detail.\n\n**Section Nine: Household Adjustments**\nThe greatest afflictions of human life arise from cravings and dietary excesses. Myriad diseases transform and spread, eroding one’s years—all stemming from this gradual corrosion.\n\nThus, the Daoist prohibitions seek not to sever entirely but to curtail extremes. As the saying goes: the *shi* (Master) exceeds, the *shang* (Merchant) falls short—neither attains the mean. Yet how far apart are excess and deficiency?\n\nIf one already suffers from chronic illness, some conditions may be remedied through diet, while others through restraint. Yet the harm or benefit to the body goes unnoticed in daily life.\n\nThe superior person, unconfused, secures life and destiny, minimizing thoughts and distancing from sensual pleasures, moderating diet and rejecting extravagance. The average person may still fail to curb extremes, while the inferior person indulges their nature, ignorant of prohibitions, lusting after beauty and wealth, corrupting their primal harmonious *qi*. Thus, the great majority inevitably suffer erosion—how could it be otherwise?\n\nAs the body declines, limbs wither and contract, chronic ailments take root and resist cure. Having neglected self-care and lacking skilled physicians, when such a state is reached, even the finest delicacies and beauties placed before them can no longer command a moment’s regard.\n\nHow much better to practice restraint, persist without weariness, and find contentment in a joyful heart and pleasing sights! Is this not wisdom?\n\nHeaven and earth intermingle their vapors, and the myriad things transform in purity. Through the union of male and female, the myriad things come to life—this is the root of human life, the origin of nurturing destiny.\n\nYet most dismiss it as baseless, calling it crude. Before twenty, recovery occurs in hours; before thirty, in days; after forty, in months; after fifty, in three months; after sixty, in seven months.\n\nThe *Daoist Canon* states: *\"At sixty, close the door.\"* This warns that those negligent in cultivating their nature will suffer harm before illness even arises. Yet even with this caution, many still fall ill.\n\nAlas! Most people fail to nurture their primal harmonious *qi* or preserve their form. Recklessly consuming cinnabar and other elixirs to fuel desires and excess, their spirit and soul detach from the body, wandering lost. Essence and vitality both perish, leaving only a hollow husk, all purpose forgotten.\n\nSome abandon their practice unfinished; others fail to begin. Their lives drift aimlessly, their bodies ravaged by illness. They rise at night unable to rest, enduring hardship through the years—all because they do not understand their nature and blindly follow vulgar passions.\n\nObserve the world: fewer than one or two in ten still have their mothers living; fewer than one or two in ten still have their fathers.

      "translated_text": "At all times of secluded union, avoid the following: when heaven and earth are dark and dim, when the sun and moon are eclipsed, during fierce winds and heavy rains, when thunder and lightning rage, on the four seasons’ turning points and the eight solar terms, on the crescent, full, waning, and new moons, when the sun and moon deviate from their courses, when auspicious clouds arise, when rainbows appear or stars streak across the sky, on one’s own fateful day, on the days of the Demon Star and the Winnowing Basket, on the days of the Six Jia, the Six Ding, the Jiazi, the Gengshen, the Ziwu, the Maoyou, and the days when the yin and yang of the Seven Luminaries are out of balance, or when celestial spirits are on duty.\n\nWhen yin qi prevails and presses upon yang, yang becomes deficient; when yang qi prevails and presses upon yin, yin becomes deficient. When yin is excessive and yang weak, or yang excessive and yin depleted, illness arises from this imbalance.\n\nFurther avoid the following: after drinking to intoxication, before the wine has worn off, after a full meal, when suddenly hungry or overly sated, after coming or going with fatigued sinews, when joy or anger remain unresolved, during a woman’s monthly flow, when exposed to cold or heat, when illness has not yet subsided, when the need to relieve oneself arises, after a recent bath, immediately after relieving oneself, at dawn and the hour of Xu, or when hastily rushing about without inclination—all these leave spirit and qi in disarray, the heart and strength insufficient. If the four limbs are weak and emaciated, the kidneys timid and frail, the six emotions unbalanced, then myriad illnesses will arise from these conditions. All the above must be scrupulously avoided.\n\nAlso avoid sacred mountains and great rivers, divine trees and temple halls, ancient altars and communal shrines, places beneath the stars and moon, before lamps and candles, or in the presence of the six livestock. Engaging in union at such places shortens lifespan, dulls one’s descendants, and must be strictly forbidden.\n\nMoreover, on the sixteenth day of the fifth month, when heaven and earth converge, union is especially forbidden, for it disrupts life’s reckoning, harms the yang path, and may never be restored—those who violate this have been proven to suffer the consequences. Generally, the fifth month is when one’s spirit is shed; the old are diminished, while the young are enhanced. One should retire early, quiet the mind, moderate desires, and harmonize the will to preserve well-being. In summer, the heart flourishes while the kidneys wane; the kidneys transform into water, awaiting autumn to congeal and winter to solidify. Summer demands the utmost care and conservation—this is most essential.\n\nWhen encountering one older than oneself, avoid union in their birth month; even with those slightly older, it is inadvisable, let alone those far senior. Yin exceeding yang greatly harms men, just as yang exceeding yin harms women—this follows the principle of Bo Le appraising horses.\n\nFurther avoid those with thin lips and large noses, sparse teeth and yellow hair, dry skin and painful ailments, discordant temperaments, coarse and stiff pubic hair, harsh voices and rough flesh, ungraceful limbs, stubborn and jealous natures, or many birthmarks—none of these should be engaged with.\n\nThe foregoing outlines the general principles of prohibitions and adjustments. For specific medicinal protections or methods of nurturing life as recorded in other classics, one may refer to their broader guidance.\n\n*Concluding the Lower Scroll of the Record of the Head-Born in the Common World.*",
      "overlap_context": "ir lives drift aimlessly, their bodies ravaged by illness. They rise at night unable to rest, enduring hardship through the years—all because they do not understand their nature and blindly follow vulgar passions.\n\nObserve the world: fewer than one or two in ten still have their mothers living; fewer than one or two in ten still have their fathers. Judging by this, most are deluded by desires, stumbling over their own lives—truly a cause for sorrow.\n\n**Section Ten: Prohibitions and Adjustments**",
