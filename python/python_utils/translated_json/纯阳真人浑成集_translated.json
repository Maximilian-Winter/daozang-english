  "full_translation": "**The Perfected One of Pure Yang’s Spontaneous Compositions**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Perfected One of Pure Yang’s Spontaneous Compositions*\nAuthored by Lü Pure Yang of the Tang dynasty. Two fascicles.\nSource edition: *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Tradition*, Supreme Mystery Section.\n\n**Preface to *The Perfected One of Pure Yang’s Spontaneous Compositions***\n\nI observe that the ancients did not compose with intent, and thus their words arose from sincerity, preserving the great essence in full. Later generations, however, wrote with the aim of fame, so their words surpassed their true feelings, and ornamental flourishes prevailed.\n\nThe great essence is rooted in spontaneity, while ornamental flourishes arise from contrivance. Spontaneity aligns with Heaven, whereas contrivance is shaped by human artifice. The expression of the heart’s voice knows no bounds—its distinctions are self-evident without speech.\n\nBehold: it blazes forth as sun and moon, manifests as the Milky Way, coalesces into mountains and rivers, scatters as grasses and trees. Gazing above and below, the myriad forms stand in perfect array—all are the patterns of Heaven and the principles of Earth. Yet in the great transformations of Heaven and Earth, where is there room for deliberate intent? They arise without speech, transform without action, for there is an inevitability that unfolds of itself.\n\nOur patriarch, the Perfected One Lü Pure Yang, mastered the learning that bridges Heaven and humanity, wielding the mechanism of creation itself. His words flowed effortlessly from his lips, his brushstrokes formed chapters without strain—never the product of cunning thought or calculated design, but rather the spontaneous effusion of celestial impulse, an irresistible outpouring.\n\nIn his exhortations to the world, he adapted his teachings to all circumstances, his language plain yet his meaning profound. Those who read them find their doubts dissolved like melting ice, their minds at ease in the natural order. Greed is tempered, shallowness deepened, and the heart stirs with thoughts of leaving the dust of the world behind.\n\nIn his sword-condemning verses, he borrowed objects to illuminate truth, his qi bold and his spirit unbound. Those who read them feel their four limbs released, their spirits clear and their qi at ease. The filth is scraped away, the light polished, and the mind soars with longing for the heavens.\n\nThe Transcendent Elder’s divine transformations were boundless, his manifestations infinite. His writings, scattered among the people, cannot be fully gathered or exhaustively presented. Yet within the repository of the canon, I have found over two hundred of his poems and verses, which I have arranged into two fascicles, naming them *Spontaneous Compositions*—for they are perfectly formed by Heaven, beyond the reach of human artifice.\n\nThe stewards of the Pure Yang Abbey have proposed carving woodblocks to disseminate this work widely, that all under Heaven may share in it. Thus, they have asked me to compose this preface. Though I am unworthy, I have reluctantly complied, offering these rough outlines.\n\nWithin these verses, ambiguities akin to miswritten characters may appear here and there. How dare I presume to alter them with my own judgment? What is doubtful shall be transmitted as doubtful, awaiting the discernment of the wise.\n\nAlas! If one can seek the poet’s heart through his poems, grasp his conduct through his heart, and from his conduct ascend to the Dao of the sages—might this not approach the Way? I cannot help but place my hopes in the keen and learned.\n\nWritten on the full moon of the intercalary tenth month in the year *qing-xinhai*, by the Pure and True Daoist of Tiaoyang, He Zhiyuan, with bowed head and reverent salute.\n\n**Preface.**\n\n**Volume One of *Spontaneous Compositions* by the Pure Yang Perfected**\n**Twenty-Nine Seven-Character Regulated Verses of Exhortation to the World**\n\nOne must not cling to the clamor of the dust;\nWithin this illusory body dwells the Dharma-body.\nDo not hoard brocade in your breast,\nBut cherish your spirit amid the world’s snares.\n\nReturn, and seek the songs of the immortals;\nIf lost, you’ll ne’er escape the bonds of the mundane.\nI tell this to the wise and heroic:\nDo not let your original truth be obscured.\n\nRiding the whale, he emerges from Dongting Lake—\nWho recognizes the carefree hermit weary of the world?\nTen thousand golden lotuses bloom in primordial chaos,\nA single moon of the heart mirrors the Void.\n\nHe seeks not to dwell in the Yellow Gold Palace,\nBut only that men abide in the White Jade Flask.\nWith a green serpent tucked in his sleeve, he departs,\nHis phoenix flute sounding as he treads the celestial capital.\n\nStarlight gleams, resplendent in verse,\nHis body drifts with idle clouds, leaving the imperial realm.\nA single elixir refined beyond the world,\nA hundred poems raved in drunken ecstasy.\n\nWithin the flask-sky lies the land of eternal spring,\nOn the island of immortals, is there no hall of endless night?\nHe treads the path beyond the azure clouds,\nProud as Fuxi in the ninth heaven.\n\nBeneath towering trees, their shade deepens the sunset glow,\nThe finest mountains belong to the Daoist’s home.\nCold ashes warm the cauldron, flames rekindle,\nWithered trees take root again, blossoms bloom.\n\nThe rise and fall of the mortal world are finite,\nBut the years of the jade palace stretch boundless.\nHeavenly winds stir jade pendants to chime,\nAs he soars to and fro in a purple phoenix chariot.\n\nFailing to awaken, the world remains coarse and clamorous,\nReturning empty-handed from the mountain of treasures.\nAt the temples, black hair turns to snow,\nThe rosy face, in an instant, becomes ashen.\n\nStrive to compose a thousand-year tune in your heart,\nFor the four illusions have never granted a day’s respite.\nHow many aspirations, inscribed on pillars and bridges,\nAre yet imprisoned by the gate of life and death?\n\nThe cloud-wandering Daoist lives at ease,\nThe yellow dust beyond his gate never dries.\nHis mind-seal transmits the moon a thousand miles,\nHis topknot bears the Five Peaks and the Seven Stars’ crown.\n\nHe unfolds secret scrolls, burning incense as he recites,\nPlucks the zither to his shadow, for none know its tune.\nThe red-crested crane stirs by the alchemical furnace—\nOne might suspect a golden elixir has taken flight.\n\nThe Void is vast, boundless,\nYet only the divine radiance ascends and descends.\nA single poetic soul, newly forged of qi,\nThe five-thousand-word teaching, an old family tradition.\n\nWhile deluded, study the ways of the mortal world;\nWhen enlightened, cultivate deeds beyond the physical.\nSpread your wings to ride the wind and return—\nDo not let yourself be easily trapped in the cage of the ordinary.\n\nMajestic and vast, descending from the celestial court,\nThe withered scene stirs melancholy.\nThe willow camp lies deep, mosquito legions thick,\nThe Yangtze’s waves stretch wide, mirage towers loom.\n\nWine banners twist like battle standards,\nFlutes and drums echo as war drums.\nCountless souls chase fame and profit—\nHow many will glimpse true peace?\n\nThe red gates must not long delay;\nBefore profit grows, harm has already multiplied.\nDo not let your sharp wit become a sword,\nBut calm your heart and still the winds of strife.\n\nThe bee, in its folly, gathers flowers into honey;\nThe silkworm dies—who will weave its cocoon into silk?\nWealth gained unjustly is greed’s gain—\nWhat end awaits such floating clouds?\n\nSee through the workings of fate’s ebb and flow,\nEmpty your heart and live at ease.\nMoonlight fills the peaks above and below,\nSpiritual forms traverse the seven-jeweled mountains.\n\nGathering heaven and earth into your palm,\nYou move the sun and moon, shaking the celestial gates.\nThe teeming masses remain unseen—\nA single mysterious pearl shines in the world.\n\nThe dream of yellow millet ends, all things cease,\nMist and waves hide the mirage towers.\nAfter three thousand days of refining lead and mercury,\nHe leaps beyond yin and yang, eight hundred autumns.\n\nHis sword hangs south of the Dipper, north of the Chief Star,\nHis qi spans the heavens, brushing the moon’s edge.\nHe came grasping a flawless mirror,\nHigh in the azure sky, yet unwilling to withdraw it.\n\nThe weave of yin and yang holds the power of creation,\nYet the human heart is often restless.\nSuddenly, the Milky Way becomes a river of clouds,\nThe snowy sky turns to rain.\n\nThe ice-fish steals warmth, floating on jade wings,\nThe plum blossom, in the cold, vies in beauty.\nPity the fleeting scene of eternal spring—\nWho will bring it to the world?\n\nThe crane’s path stretches far,\nIts song compels, its purity overwhelms.\nThe plum’s soul is stolen by the wind,\nThe bamboo’s shadow is cast by the moon.\n\nThe good mountain is known to delight the benevolent,\nFine wine suits the old man’s heart.\nWith whom shall I escape the net of the world,\nAnd wander the paradise gardens in peace?\n\nI recall riding the wind beneath the jade canopy,\nFragrant clouds thickly veiling the dragon chariot.\nI awaited the gathering of immortals in the Penglai gardens,\nDrunk, I slept in the mountain hermit’s home.\n\nZhuang Zhou’s butterfly dream is truly savored,\nThe deer mistaken for Zheng’s minister—how lamentable!\nWho can grasp this mystery’s delight,\nAnd together sail the Silver River on a moonlit night?\n\nDo not neglect the spiritual source, plant descendants,\nPreserve the mandate of return and the root of home.\nWithdraw, and do not summon the Shushan courtesans,\nHold simplicity, and do not open the northern sea’s cup.\n\nThe purple phoenix has not yet ridden to the crimson palace,\nThe black-robed one has already shed the red gates.\nI wish you would not steal the starving people’s grain,\nBut follow me to repay the Jade Emperor’s grace.\n\nThe blessings of past lives are seen in the present,\nThe causes of future lives are observed now.\nOnly after three lifetimes of wisdom does one become an official,\nOnly after five births of clarity does one hold office.\n\nDo not plant thorns in the garden of your heart,\nDo not let weapons loose from your wit’s tip.\nTake up the sword of wisdom and return—\nSpare yourself the battles of hunger and cold.\n\nHalf-drunk, half-sober, I leave the divine capital,\nThe rivers and mountains remain dim, the sky unbright.\nDharma rain briefly follows the torrential downpour,\nCompassion clouds idly drift with the evening mist.\n\nThe dust of the world has settled,\nBeyond the physical, the Dao’s power flourishes in hidden growth.\n\nThe Dao’s power flourishes as worldly dust settles,\nWithin the spirit’s terrace, all rejoice in pure tranquility.\nSacred virtue and mortal passions cannot align—\nA light rod vainly cast toward the sea’s heart.\n\nA single line dangles fragrant bait,\nOn Qili Shoal’s rocks, the angler sits.\nBright moon fills the sky o’er crimson shores,\nClear wind brushes sleeves of green straw cloak.\nWater cold, night still—no fish are caught,\nLaughing, he points to the Yangtze and sighs *shiwei*.\n\nSun and moon hasten forth, then return west,\nTurning heads, the years flow by the hundreds and thousands.\nDo not chase yin demons to dissolve cinnabar,\nBut refine golden lead within the elixir crucible.\nIn the dust, fear only tardy retreat;\nBeyond the physical, act swiftly first.\nShatter this hollow void,\nThen brush your sleeves and ascend the clouded peaks.\n\nA limpid stream from the ancient numinous source,\nUnsullied by even a speck of dust.\nBright, bright—like the radiant moon,\nLeisurely, leisurely—as idle clouds.\nSplit open heaven and earth’s cage and net,\nLeap beyond yin-yang’s creative pass.\nIn the mundane realm, some may briefly awaken—\nTurning the light inward, home lies before your face.\n\nThe true nature was ever free,\nLet not worldly affairs forcibly confine it.\nIn the waves of right and wrong, best seal your lips;\nIn the arena of fame and gain, withdraw your head.\nDebts to kin and karmic ties—now settled,\nThe paths of life and death—now at rest.\nBeneath the azure crags and verdant pines, carefree,\nWatching fading blossoms drift upon the stream.\n\nA pellet of elixir, long refined to joy,\nShines brilliantly, high as Kunlun’s peaks.\nThe benevolent cauldron tames dragon and tiger,\nOpening the furnace startles ghosts and gods.\nVast enough to embrace heaven and earth—yet still too narrow,\nFine as dust and sand—yet not too full.\nTouch a stubborn stone, and gold is made;\nWhy then do men fail to attain immortality?\n\nThe Dragon Spring sword, forged without counting autumns,\nPreserves the Dharma-nature in perfect wholeness.\nDivine radiance leaves its sheath, illuminating sun and moon,\nCold flames pierce the clouds, striking the Dipper and Ox.\nWielded, it purifies the ten directions and three realms;\nBrandished, a hundred demons and myriad fiends lament.\nSent by decree from the Celestial Capital,\nIt is bestowed upon the valiant of the human world.\n\nBefore Yellow Crane Tower, the Lü family’s home,\nA gourd holds heaven and earth, aging with rosy clouds.\nFormless white deer harmonize with crimson phoenixes,\nA black tortoise coils around a scarlet serpent.\nIn June, white snow flies on mountain peaks;\nIn midwinter, yellow sprouts grow beneath the waters.\nIf men but recognized these principles,\nLand-bound immortals would swarm like hemp.\n\nEyes meet a thousand differences, ten thousand things—\nYet a single point before the breast anchors serene leisure.\nKnowing the truth is like the moon in meditation,\nNever return empty-handed from the treasure mountain.\nWide sleeves sweep away affliction’s barriers,\nStraw sandals tread through the gates of life and death.\nOnce this move is set in place,\nNo longer subject to yin-yang’s playful questions.\n\nRosy clouds drift, veiling the immortal palace,\nVast qi surges, filling the great void.\nA lotus stem holds the Milky Way’s moon,\nThe roc soars ten thousand miles on sea and mountain winds.\nSpiritual light reflects beyond primordial heaven,\nThe perfect circle embraces the Great Dao.\nNearby stands the White Prime Lord,\nYet worldly men, lost in busyness, cannot fathom him.\n\nAdvancing, do not covet what is unjust;\nRetreating, recognize your original truth.\nPractice compassion, accumulate boundless merit;\nCurb desire, spare your finite body.\nGreen temples can only turn to white hair,\nRed dust never again meets youth’s spring.\nIf you fully grasp these wild words,\nBecome a carefree being beyond the physical.\n\nWho among the Luofu Daoists shares this path?\nClad in grass, fed on wood, they scorn kings and lords.\nThe world’s sixty-year cycles cannot bind them,\nWithin their gourds, heaven and earth are free.\nCounting moves in a lingering chess game as the river moon dawns,\nA long whistle heralds autumn over sea and mountain.\nAfter drinking, turning to speak of the return,\nThey point afar to white clouds at the sky’s edge.\n\nThe celestial net is vast, myriad forms sparse—\nA single pine falls, and Mount Hua withers.\nAfter cold clouds disperse, a waning moon remains;\nWhen winter snow arrives, it vanishes into the void.\nTen caves’ dragons and serpents return to the Purple Palace,\nA thousand years’ simurghs and phoenixes alight on Cangwu.\nSince parting from the Master,\nNorth, south, east, west—few true men remain.\n\n**Five-Character Regulated Verse**\n\nNight still on the cold river,\nLine reeled in, waves gather.\nAlas, too few fragrant baits,\nVainly watching brocaded scales teem.\nPlanning to turn the boat back,\nYet still ensnared by the scene.\nLingering beneath the bright moon,\nIn vain, the old fisher’s cloak.\n\nTo reach the realm of cultivating truth,\nOne must rely on the power of creation.\nThe Azure Dragon swallows purple mist,\nThe White Tiger exhales blue smoke.\nLuminous qi rises through the three realms,\nYang light pierces the nine springs.\nA single pellet of elixir is complete—\nReturning to the state before birth.\n\n**Seven-Character Quatrains**\n\nDo not prize glory and cling to ministerial rank,\nIn forests and springs, one may hide anywhere.\nYou know those who once fled Qin—\nNow dwell as people within Peach Blossom Spring.\n\nRed gates pilfer profit, endlessly scheming,\nComing as foam, going as waves.\nEven reaching the Jade Hall as chief minister,\nWho today remains like Xiao He of Han?\n\nFelling the numinous root, exhausting true essence,\nBeneath the skull’s face, seeking spirit.\nMeeting, all say they seek immortality—\nYet who has ever seen one on Penglai Isle?\n\nGathering true essence, nurturing the elixir,\nThe inch of heart unobstructed, naturally at ease.\nWhen merit is complete and conduct fulfilled, longing for return,\nA purple phoenix delivers a letter to the world.\n\nGrass’s shade fades, earth’s thunder roars,\nStars and constellations stretch across ten thousand miles.\nCalling back Pure Yang to its rightful place,\nJust before noon, the third watch is heard.\n\nA human life spans ten thousand kalpas of cultivation,\nWhy toil endlessly for family worries?\nIn the end, leave it to sons and grandsons to reckon—\nWhat reason to labor like oxen and horses?\n\nDragons weary of roaring, tigers of roaring,\nThe general still has not doffed his armor.\nFurious winds sweep the earth, overturning heaven,\nShaking the cosmos, killing qi soars high.\n\nShatter the void and seize it at once,\nSeizing it is best for one’s livelihood.\nNot seeking the head-covered path of silent meditation,\nMocking the old masters who came from the West.\n\nDo not boast of youth’s gallantry,\nStriving and struggling, trading in bones.\nIf unconvinced, try gazing into a bright mirror—\nBeneath the skin, only a skeleton remains.\n\nWhen the heart turns from avarice, contemplate the true Dao;\nWhen the eyes turn from beauty, gaze toward Wuling.\nOn the wrist that plucks osmanthus, cast off the jade clasp;\nOn the feet that tread clouds, untie the bonds of favor.\n\nThe people have long been trapped in warfare,\nNot in furrowed brows or sighing voices.\nA safe haven lies just ahead,\nYet men’s hearts remain unsettled, unpeaceful.\n\nWooden idols, clay statues—still forms in quietude,\nLet the mind’s realm remain unstained by even a speck of dust.\nSilent and profound, without interruption,\nThis flavor accords with the Perfect Truth.\n\nAsk not of the clamor in the marketplace,\nFor beyond its dust lie misty mountains.\nIf only the heart’s square inch remains free of the slightest shadow,\nOne gains a realm of leisure within the celestial gourd.\n\nXiao He of Han was buried in the earth,\nCao Zhi’s literary fame brought him only sorrow.\nReflecting on this desolate world,\nIt is far better to return home.\n\nI admire the white-haired elder, so worthy,\nA man of kindness, refined in manner and bearing.\nHow might one invite him to ride the wind away,\nTo become master of the clouds and mountains?\n\nChildren’s clothing and sustenance are sought by children,\nIn vain does greed force one to thrust forward.\nOnly when sorrow arrives and years come to an end,\nDoes resentment turn level ground into barren mounds.\n\nLiving in humble poverty is no disgrace,\nWhile lofty prominence is no true strength.\nObserve the days of peace and tranquility—\nWho remains, and who has perished?\n\n**Against Wine**\nBeware wine, beware wine,\nPreserve the primal radiance within.\nSoaring freely to the Jade Capital Peak,\nHeaven and earth brew nectar aplenty.\n\n**Against Lust**\nBeware lust, beware lust,\nThe moment desire arises, the primordial spirit perishes.\nNaturally, in the Jade Hall of matrimony,\nA single spark of spirit outshines a thousand feet of snow.\n\n**Against Greed**\nBeware wealth, beware wealth,\nLet it not bury the world’s people in suffering.\nWithin the Seven Treasures of one’s own forest,\nA true person builds a tower of jade.\n\n**Against Anger**\nBeware wrath, beware wrath,\nIt may be gentle but must not be abandoned.\nOne day, when it surges and transforms into the primordial spirit,\nIt will ascend the azure heavens to pay homage to the Jade Emperor.\n\n**Against Sorrow**\nBeware sorrow, beware sorrow,\nHow long will the relentless pursuit of fame and profit last?\nGlory, wealth, and honor—how long can they endure?\nWhen the limit arrives, how can they be retained?\n\n**The Heart-Sword**\nI possess a Longquan sword, sheathed and hidden,\nIts light polishes men’s livers and gallbladders, brightening their spirits.\nOnce drawn and raised in the central palace,\nDemons a thousand miles away dare not stand before it.\n\n**The Heart-Seal**\nCold light, unmoving, naturally so,\nAdapting to all, now square, now round.\nOnce stamped, one knows there is no \"that,\"\nThis life is but the state before birth.\n\n**The Heart-Mirror**\nHigh upon the spirit terrace, long unpolished,\nIt naturally reflects the ten thousand forms.\nLet dust settle without blowing—\nIf blown, what does the dust reveal?\n\n**The Heart-Lamp**\nA single flame of the heart-lamp burns brightly,\nNo need to tend it—it shines of itself.\nWhen obtained, it illuminates the darkness of the world,\nRadiating cold light throughout the Great Purity.\n\n**The Heart-Moon**\nA single wheel of the heart-moon adheres to the celestial court,\nThe hare’s spirit and toad’s soul are exceptionally clear.\nEven a wisp of idle cloud cannot obscure it,\nIt penetrates heaven and earth, perfectly round.\n\n**The Heart-Ground**\nThe heart-ground requires no laborious plowing,\nIn stillness, the sprouts of the Dao alone grow.\nOnce I have filled all its ravines,\nIt rests in serene tranquility, a level expanse.\n\n**The Most Profound Song**\nWhy did I spend six years on Snow Ridge?\nWith resolve firm, harmonizing qi and spirit.\nIn a hundred moments, all is but a single breath—\nOnly then does the Great Dao reveal the Three Vehicles.\n\nThe Jade Emperor sent me to transform the foolish,\nYet the world’s people remain distant from the Dao.\nThe four seasons stealthily steal the treasures of the body,\nThe five agents openly plunder the pearls upon the face.\n\nYear after year, the pursuit of fame and profit persists,\nDay by day, right and wrong depart and vanish.\nTurning back, I return to the path of the Three Isles,\nLest the Emperor send down a celestial talisman.\n\nRefining cinnabar through nine cycles of firing,\nThe fire’s timing naturally unfurls the child’s blossom.\nFrom the stars, the blue lotus seed is forged,\nBeneath the sun and moon, the white horse’s sprout is nurtured.\n\nSeven returns transform into verdant mist,\nNine reversals culminate in crimson clouds.\nWhoever seizes the Mysterious Pearl as sustenance,\nFinds the path to the Three Isles not far.\n\nIn the West, the Jade Maiden gives birth to golden sprouts,\nFor heaven and earth’s fire burns of itself.\nThe Water Tiger lies beneath the clouded mountains,\nThe Fire Dragon scatters its hues across the sea.\n\nWhen the yang soul flourishes, heaven is not distant,\nAs the yin spirit conjoins, earth is not far.\nOnce merit is complete, the five colors naturally arise,\nRiding the simurgh, one freely ascends the cloudy heavens.\n\nHeaven engenders one flavor, transforming the Three Powers,\nAs yin and yang interact, the sacred embryo forms.\nDragon and Tiger proceed in order, the yin ghost flees,\nTortoise and Serpent reverse course, the Fire Dragon arrives.\n\nThe infant shares the golden marrow,\nThe Crone pours the white jade cup.\nOnce merit is complete, one naturally transcends the mundane,\nIn the world, the cycles of cold and heat pass unheeded.\n\nStars gather in the Li region,\nThe waxing and waning of sun and moon aid the Medicine King.\nFor three periods, fire refines the golden tripod’s treasure,\nFive talismans and water temper the jade flask’s nectar.\n\nHeaven and earth overturn, the Dragon brings rain,\nAt Mao and You, the Tiger devours and radiates light.\nEntering the chamber, employ the mechanism to seize and capture—\nA single pill of cinnabar, the medicine of pure yang.\n\nThe Eight Trigrams communicate with Kan and Li,\nWhen Zhen and Dui interact, the Two Modes unite.\nWhen taking action, seize the moment of supremacy,\nRefine and fire until ripe—do not delay.\n\nEighty-one years within the womb,\nTo refine pure yang through eighty-one cycles.\nRiding clouds by day, returning to the upper realms,\nEven now, I wander and rest in the Purple Tenuity Palace.\n\nWithin the gourd, the Four Images are naturally divine,\nYet they are said to rule the people for ages.\nThough employing weapons to pacify the cosmos,\nThe two wheels of sun and moon still traverse ceaselessly.\n\nWhy labor with multitudes to still the world?\nNorth and south doors now stand open to each other.\nThis employs none other than Dragon and Tiger,\nEightfold divine light shines through to the very bottom.\n\nEach must arise from each,\nTrue gold meets and contends.\nWhere the yang soul ends, yin must disperse,\nTransforming into the essence of heaven and earth, sun and moon.\n\nThe Five Agents must pair as husband and wife,\nThe Kan man and Li woman—few understand.\nWhen the two bodies interact and harmonize,\nThen the Elder of Bing becomes the true elder.\n\nYear after year, the method for changing bones differs,\nOne must refine Dragon and Tiger at the center.\nWhen merit is complete, it takes but three thousand days,\nBlood transforms into jasper, marrow into frost.\n\nThe essence of the Five Agents is contained within one,\nArranged in cycles, awaiting the fire’s timing.\nOnly when water returns to the spirit chamber,\nDoes one ascend from level ground to the azure heavens.\n\nThe Northern House holds the Li image, the Kan House bears its bloom,\nFurther binding the eastern neighbor, where the Zhen’s inner sprout grows.\nWhenever the Elder of Bing draws near to guide,\nThey must wrestle within the furnace’s embrace.\n\nThe Four Symbols cycle in reverence to Wu and Ji,\nCultivating tranquility—all hinges on the sovereign’s will.\nMetal and Wood converge as Water and Fire unite,\nA single streak of crimson radiance bridges the cavernous expanse.\n\nCherish the single grain of elixir within the flask,\nTreasured deep in the secluded grotto of Kun Mountain.\nThis is no common herb for mortal inquiry—\nOnce ingested, the body joins the ranks of the sages.\n\nThe alchemical process demands nine revolutions,\nTiger and Dragon’s numbers fulfilled, fire propels them on.\nAt once, one advances in the Dao, standing before the court,\nFierce and swift, relying on the Xun gate’s breath.\n\nPounding and blending find no path when timing is amiss,\nResolve lies in wholehearted, meticulous observation.\nThe chaste maiden surely knows within the raven’s shadow,\nThe infant brother dwells only at the moon’s edge.\n\nWithin the mystery, the path grows ever more profound,\nPainstaking words fail—it lies beyond all speech.\nShould the moment come with no clear choice,\nHow can one glimpse the root without a gateway?\n\nNurture the brother’s form to mirror my own,\nMy body withers while the child’s essence shines.\nGeneration after generation, ever thus—\nHow could it compare to preserving spirit and cultivating the self?\n\n**Five-Word Extended Verse**\n*A Hundred-Character Poem*\n\nMy nature delights in purity and stillness,\nPreserving the heart’s source in steadfastness.\nWealth—I do not covet,\nQi—I do not contend.\n\nWine—when have I ever drunk?\nDesire for sensual pleasures—already extinguished.\nWhat I see, as if unseen,\nWhat I hear, as if unheard.\n\nNever speak of others’ faults,\nOnly seek my own afflictions.\nNo name binds me in officialdom,\nIn private, I act by trust alone.\n\nWhen encountering gain, not frivolous,\nWhen facing absence, I hold to my duty.\nNot trapped in another’s shell,\nI dispel the gloom within my heart.\n\nHarmonizing light while mingling with the dust,\nI blend with worldly sentiments.\nWhy not vie for fame?\nOnce discussed with lofty souls.\n\n**Five-Word Regulated Verse**\n*Self-Reflection*\n\n**Five-Word Quatrains**\n\n**Mountain Immortal**\nA mountain immortal, unknown to all,\nGirds his sword and enters the Great Tang.\nTurning his head to gaze south and north,\nHe has no intent to return home.\n\n**Yesterday at Nimo Temple**\nYesterday at Nimo Temple,\nEarly I sensed my robes turn yellow.\nA black wind swept through in a gust—\nA hundred ghosts all hid in silence.\n\n**The Qin**\nSeven strings unleash refined melodies,\nTen fingers pour forth the wind through pines.\nAwakening from this floating-life dream,\nThe moon, serene, imprints the empty sky.\n\n**Chess**\nBlack and white—my heart cannot decide,\nWhen have I ever faced it at leisure?\nWithin the kalpa, myriad paths are perilous,\nLife and death hang on a single move.\n\n**Calligraphy**\nGrieving the fall of Zhou’s latter days,\nScholars still search in vain.\nEach bears benevolence and wisdom,\nYet who attains the heart of Confucius?\n\n**Painting**\nHow lovely the hand of the artist,\nMaster of boundless samādhi’s power.\nHow many scenes of rivers and mountains—\nAll held within a single inch of heart.\n\n---\n\n**Four-Word Quatrains**\n\n**Purity**\nA single thought does not arise,\nWhence could the myriad illusions spring?\nVast and empty, boundless—\nMoon pale, wind clear.\n\n**Stillness**\nExternal realms do not intrude,\nThe inner spirit settles of itself.\nA single point of numinous light—\nLuminous, still, and bright.\n\n**Dao/Way**\nThe principle of non-action runs deep,\nSeeking it, one delves ever further.\nYet grasp it with an unforced hand—\nThis is called the Dao/Way.\n\n**Virtue/Power**\nVirtue, too, has no form,\nYet nothing it does not nurture.\nWhen all things bear their bloom,\nThis is true virtue/power.\n\n**Action**\nThough the dharma-realm is vast,\nIt may be traversed and transcended.\nStep with feet in the pure wind,\nGrasp the bright moon in your hand.\n\n**Abiding**\nIn motion, words fail,\nIn stillness, speech is void.\nForget both motion and stillness—\nRest here in the midst.\n\n**Sitting**\nThe heart extinguished like cold ash,\nThe body forgotten like clod of earth.\nSilent, dark, and profound—\nRadiance illumines the three realms.\n\n**Reclining**\nThe family tradition of purity,\nThe wondrous secret of the unseen and unheard.\nRelease the four great elements—\nThe myriad illusions all dissolve.\n\n---\n\n**Six-Word Poems**\n\nSpring’s warmth, half-opened blossoms,\nWandering at ease upon the stone.\nAlone I hold jade precepts and golden secrets,\nLeisurely treading green moss and emerald moss.\n\nNineteen years I slept in an ancient cave,\nDrank flowing radiance by the thousand cups.\nWhen meeting others, speak not of worldly affairs—\nLaughing, point to the white clouds’ comings and goings.\n\n---\n\n**Song of the Fallen**\nFallen, ah fallen—\nAt night, lodging in rustic villages,\nBy day, roaming the city walls.\nWhen idle, I wander the verdant mountains,\nWhen bored, peddle elixirs in the marketplace.\n\nThe coins I earn, not counted,\nSpent on fine wine, poured for myself.\nDrunk, my chants shake ghosts and gods,\nCarefree as the sun sinks in the west.\n\n---\n\n**Seven-Word Regulated Verses**\n\n**The Perfected One’s Departure**\nWhen merits are complete, salvation’s meeting is hard to come by,\nAgain I hear you must depart from Apricot Immortal’s Altar.\nAt your staff’s tip, spring’s hues—a gourd of wine,\nAtop your head, clouds pierce the Five Peaks’ crown.\n\nThe sea-turtle child, none recognize,\nThe mountain-burning talisman, ghosts dare not behold.\nAfter the master’s gone, this body must age—\nI beg you, give this poor scholar a bone-transforming elixir.\n\n**The Golden Elixir**\nA single grain of golden elixir ensures long life,\nBut true lead must refine the cyclical stems.\nFire draws the red phoenix’s marrow from the south,\nWater seeks the black turtle’s essence from the northern sea.\n\nThe crucible follows the four seasons, uniting at the center,\nThe medicine moves with the three primals and eight trigrams.\nAfter fasting and purifying, refine it nine times—\nKnow then that upon entering the mouth, gods and ghosts will tremble.\n\n**The Perfected One by the Emerald Pool**\nBy the emerald pool, a true person appears,\nHis face like peach blossoms, his body like silver.\nHis temples show no gray—he has the art,\nHis complexion stays young—he has attained the divine.\n\nNow is the time to ascend Penglai,\nThe yellow robes on the rack turn to clouds.\nThough mulberry fields may turn to seas,\nA single pill of elixir secures a thousand springs.\n\n**Refining Cinnabar**\nThe furnace nurtures cinnabar—no gray at the temples,\nWhy trouble with fame and profit, dwelling among men?\nI have met the perfected and received the divine medicine,\nAnd rejoice with fellow seekers, smiling as we move.\n\nLaozi’s Dao has been entrusted to me,\nThe Lesser Star permits me to ascend with it.\nFortunate to be gathered by the lofty ones,\nIn this world, I yield to you a life of leisure.\n\n**Who Waits for Immortality?**\nWho waits for immortality to be bestowed upon me?\nI refine true qi within the immortal embryo.\nI know well that I shall ascend to heaven in broad daylight,\nYet I have just descended into the red dust of the world.\n\nWhen the White Tiger moves, rain and dew pour,\nWhere the Red Dragon plows, jasper and jade appear.\nSwallow but a single grain of cinnabar medicine—\nI shall soar into the azure clouds and never return.\n\n**The Hidden Sage**\nAmid the tumbled clouds, the starry capital appears,\nDiscerning the deeply concealed true man.\nDrunk on green wine, he sleeps through sun and moon,\nWhen the white duckweed’s wind stills, he fishes by rivers and lakes.\n\nEver aligning his bearing with heaven’s Dao,\nHe does not waste words on the world’s paths.\nThe mountain and water roads are distant, none reach them—\nDo the reeds and thatch hold any news?\n\n**The Crane as Chariot**\nThe crane serves as chariot, wine as provisions,\nTransforming this into the land of long life, undying.\nEven earth’s veins can be shortened,\nHow can human life not be made to lengthen?\n\nIn his hairpin, stars and constellations often appear,\nBeneath his robe, sun and moon are often concealed.\nIf the common folk wish to meet him in person,\nDay after day, they must not leave the path of mercury.\n\n**The Magic Mushroom**\nThe magic mushroom has no seed, no root,\nYet it can be drunk, consumed, and revive the soul.\nAs long as mist and rosy clouds sustain the years,\nLet the crow and hare race through the cosmos.\n\nThe infant only clings to the mother in the yang,\nThe crone must face the honored one atop her head.\nOnce attained, it does not return for a thousand ages—\nNo tombs or graves will be left for descendants.\n\n**Who Understands These Words?**\nWho in this world understands these words?\nDo not hang fame and profit upon your heart’s field.\nCasually pour out wine to the full,\nWhen inspired, chant a hundred verses.\n\nBeyond the world, mist and rosy clouds are my companions,\nWithin the gourd, sun and moon follow the fair one.\nWhen the time comes and merits are complete, where shall I return?\nI shall ride the cloud chariot straight into the grotto-heaven.\n\n**The Emperor’s Son of the Mysterious Gate**\nThe Emperor’s Son of the Mysterious Gate sits at the center,\nHis life long and luminous, moved by the Jade Sovereign.\nThe world’s mountains and rivers harmonize with rain and dew,\nWithin his sleeve, sun and moon merge with Xiao and Xiang.\n\nThe Kan male is betrothed to the Jin family’s daughter,\nThe Li female, wedded in triumph, marries the Wooden Lad.\nTruly, if husband and wife can hold fast to their resolve,\nThey shall establish teachings to entangle yin and yang.\n\n**Retreat from the Mortal Frame**\nHow many years have passed since I shed my mortal frame?\nBeyond the high green peaks, I feed on the mysterious frost.\nAncient snow on the blue mountains encircles my pine couch,\nCold clouds from the immortal’s palm refine the stone chamber.\n\nI often climb the shell-paved towers to pluck tender jade herbs,\nAt times I break fragrant osmanthus in the Moon Palace.\nBrilliant as brocade, it once opened for me—\nPermitting me to wander the Five Emperors’ realm.\n\n**A Whistle Toward the Distant Peak**\nPointing afar to the high peak, I let out a whistle—\nRed radiance and purple mist arise before my face.\nOften in the dusty market, none recognize me,\nYet when I reach the mountains, cranes come to greet me.\n\nWith staff I play the jade toad to drive away ghosts and specters,\nBy night I boil the golden tripod to cook the stars.\nWhen one day I journey to Penglai Grotto,\nKnow that my immortal household bears a name.\n\nHow laughable are the worldly who ask of my home—\nMy cloud-sleeved staff brushes against mist and rosy clouds.\nMy brows conceal lightning, no idle boast,\nMy hands plant golden lotuses, yet I do not boast.\n\nA three-foot scorched paulownia is my living craft,\nA pot of spring wine is my livelihood.\nRiding a dragon, I roam far to the Three Isles,\nBeneath the night moon, none remain to sully its radiance.\n\nBy the winding river’s edge, I sit and gaze outward,\nA single long path ascends to heaven’s end.\nAuspicious clouds bear the Red Child in their embrace,\nAuspicious vapors linger where white mists arise.\n\nLead and mercury now become the supreme medicine,\nKan and Li today fuse to form the elixir.\nIts power can save lives, banishing age and decay—\nIt lies in the human heart, not in difficulty.\n\nCultivate, cultivate, cultivate until you reach Qian’s perfection,\nThen you may be called the world’s drunken immortal.\nIn the world, time hurries short-lived scenes,\nWithin the grotto, flowers and trees enjoy eternal years.\n\nMy form soars the sheer cliffs, knowing dragon bones,\nMy spirit dwells in the Mysterious Palace, another heaven apart.\nI only wish the master would glance my way often,\nNo need to seek mysteries beyond the mystery.\n\nThe mystery of the Mystic Gate, the principle of the mystery—again mysterious,\nThe root of deathlessness lies in mercury and lead.\nKnow this as the true and sole defense,\nHarmonizing the Six-and-One, it too aligns with heaven.\n\nBeneath Jade Capital Mountain, lambs frolic,\nBy Golden Water River, stone tigers slumber.\nThe subtlest art can generate the true original body,\nDiligence in every place brings effortless mastery.\n\nThough nobles and ministers are honored, I do not respond,\nMentioning the immortal’s life, I depart to wander.\nFor holding a liver of stone, I met the mirage sea,\nIn seeking sweet snow, I reached Yingzhou.\n\nAfter mountains and rivers grow drunk, they are stored within the gourd,\nWhen gods and ghosts grow idle, they are gathered into the casket.\nSeeing none here recognize me,\nI would rather blend with the mortal stream over cups of wine.\n\nOnce I paid homage to the Primordial One to visit the immortals,\nFreely ascending Kunlun to sip the moon’s essence.\nJade maidens gathered the verdant beauty of pines,\nMountain lads carried white jade tablets.\n\nFrom time to time, I poured the thousand-year wine of the sea,\nAccustomed to plucking the four-season flowers within the gourd.\nNow in the mortal realm, none recognize me,\nSoon I shall wave my sleeves and enter mist and rosy clouds.\n\nFire sown in the cinnabar field, gold naturally grows,\nLayer upon layer of pavilions, so distinct.\nThree thousand merits in a hundred days,\nA journey of ten thousand miles to Penglai in a single day.\n\nMy form transforms in the netherworld, no ghostly register holds me,\nIn the Jade Capital, my immortal name endures.\nThis morning I attend the Jasper Pool assembly,\nNine-tiered banners and streamers welcome me within the grotto.\n\nGazing upon Master Cui’s *Mirror of Ingested Medicine*,\nMy heart’s ground grows ever clearer.\nThe yang dragon speaks, emerging from the Li Palace,\nThe yin tiger returns, born upon the Kan trigram.\n\nWhen these two meet, they form the root of the Dao,\nTraversing the five directions, they attain the elixir’s name.\nIf cultivators of truth know this,\nThey shall surely ride the red dragon back to Jade Capital.\n\nFloating life is insubstantial, treated with neglect,\nIngesting and concealing, the body holds wondrous bones.\nHaving understood right and wrong, I question worldly folk—\nHow can they transcend things to commune with nothingness?\n\nSpeaking with mortals, my feelings grow dull,\nWalking alone, I lightly brush past.\nA single speck of powder divides into five hues,\nFlying elixir enters the grotto of immortals.\n\nDo not wonder that I love to chant celestial poems,\nFor I have rarely heard such in the mortal world.\nAccustomed to dining on the Queen Mother’s grotto rice,\nI once wore the Penglai grotto’s robes.\n\nMy steed treads the sun’s wheel, red mist unfurls,\nThe phoenix bears the moon’s horn, azure clouds take flight.\nWhen shall I again rein the green-silk bridle,\nAnd brandish my golden whip to enter the Purple Tenuity?\n\nYellow sprout and white snow, both transmute into gold,\nWalking, I sing loudly; drunk, I chant.\nSun and moon secretly support your chronicles,\nHeaven and earth naturally befriend me.\n\nSpirits vanish at the trace of the Three Clarities’ sword,\nWind and rain soar as I play my zither.\nWhere shall I return after my southern journey?\nDo not let the crane depart to seek me in heaven.\n\nSpring arrives, I wander to the immortal’s home,\nWhere doors display extraordinary February blossoms.\nThe cyclical stems reveal your life’s work,\nThe cyclical branches fulfill your destiny—no need for boasting.\n\nEach possesses a pure, numinous nature beyond heaven,\nHow could one forget the turbid and cast aside arrogance?\nIf you grasp the thousand-day effort,\nYou shall return after ten thousand years into mist and rosy clouds.\n\nCloud-like tresses gleam, my bones grow lighter,\nI say I seek the crane to reach Penglai and Yingzhou.\nDiscussing herbs and music all day, I know their savor,\nAsking of immortals, I learn all their names.\n\nOn clear nights, the azure dragon pierces the emerald grotto,\nIn cold repose, I lie high in the White Silver City.\nCome spring, I shall again take up my staff to depart,\nRecalling Xuanyuan’s journey upon the sea.\n\nDragon essence and tortoise eyes harmonize,\nThe sixteen-foot lad cannot endure.\nNine cups of water simmer the Red Child,\nA single wheel of fire nurtures the yellow sprout.\n\nThe moon, full, naturally dissolves the heavenly net,\nOnly when merits are complete does one know how to escape the earthly snare.\nHalf-drunk, I happily swallow phoenix marrow,\nI urge you, no longer mistake the fleeting for the eternal.\n\nForcing myself to dwell in this scene, bereft of kindred spirits,\nThough wild scenes abound, they do not suit my chant.\nIf my verses clamor in the ears of ministers,\nMy name shall stir the hearts of emperors.\n\nThe Dao has no sash, I sleep alone,\nFlowered bamboo hat and bark crown, I am too lazy to don.\nBeyond this, I have no other affairs—\nA pot of rustic wine, a zither.\n\nWithin Huayang Mountain lie many fields of mushrooms,\nThe old man of Huayang Mountain further extends his years.\nBeneath the towering boughs by the verdant pine mounds,\nI drink the flying spring amid white clouds.\n\nNeither cold nor hot, my spirit sways,\nComing from the west, departing to the east, my qi flows gently.\nWhen three thousand merits are complete, it is time to return,\nDo not speak of the grotto-heaven to worldly folk.\n\nHeaven-born, the natural heart does not scatter,\nSuccess and failure have ever been thus, from ancient times to now.\nThose who find the path know all shall transcend the world,\nThe deluded forever sink in vain.\n\nThe supreme joy at one’s side demands refinement,\nBeyond things, the cinnabar sand must be carefully sought.\nThe immortal’s realm lies within the grotto chamber, a hand’s span away,\nDo not follow the waves and squander your radiance.\n\nI have hidden in the Mysterious Capital, forgetting spring,\nHow many times has the azure sea turned to dust?\nWithin the Jade Capital’s hall, I paid homage to the Primordial One,\nIn the Golden Gate Palace, I bowed to the Old Lord.\n\nWhen bored, I ride the thousand-year crane,\nWhen at leisure, I soar beyond the nine heavens’ clouds.\nNow I have learned the art of longevity,\nYet I am not willing to pass it on to the world.\n\nGazing within the palms of the Northern Emperor and Southern Star,\nI secretly penetrate creation’s mysteries.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** *Kan* (坎) and *Li* (离) refer to the trigrams representing Water and Fire in the *Yijing*, often symbolizing yin and yang forces in Daoist internal alchemy.

starry palaces descend from the Supreme Mystery.\nThe world entire seeks this Dao—\nYet who, in vain, grasps the Mysterious Pass?\n\nBrightly the Dao abides, awaiting its reckoning;\nBy the shoals of sun and moon, it departs and returns.\nWithin the radiance of daylight, it merges with nature,\nAs thunder races and lightning strikes the Central Plain.\n\nEver riding the crimson steed, dwelling in the Eastern Hall,\nGrandly unsealed the vermilion gates, floating upon azure springs.\nFiercely drawing the Kunwu blade to sing of sagely transformation,\nJoyfully accompanying the solitary moon to celebrate the new year.\n\nOnly then is it known as the immortals’ treasure,\nBestowed solely upon the virtuous for transmission.\nSix dragons in unison hail ascension to Qian,\nTheir horns subtly wielding the power of creation.\n\nThe true Dao often hums beneath the pale autumn moon,\nThe profound word ever flows through the chill jade waves.\nBy day, riding the white stag through Peng Isle,\nBy night, crowned in gold, standing atop the ancient altar.\n\nA single year yields the elixir of a thousand ages—\nWho would sully their sleeves with the dust of the mortal realm?\nUpon the shoals of the Five Peaks, the scene renews,\nThe virtuous one alone attains the formless body.\n\nHeavenly songs convey the Dao as the Three Origins settle,\nEarth’s veins pulse, bringing forth the myriad beings.\nAwaken to the Valley Spirit and cultivate this Way,\nCease discourse on principle and seek the real.\n\nBrightly expounded along the path of the Central Yellow,\nAmidst the thunder’s roar, one attains the divine.\nLonging to join the immortal maidens, the body grows light,\nSoaring past Penglai to reach the Highest Clarity.\n\nCrimson-crested cranes arrive from beyond the clouds,\nPurple-scaled fish welcome from the sea’s depths.\nChang’e’s tender osmanthus blooms first,\nThe Queen Mother’s immortal peaches gradually ripen.\n\nGazing down, the sun’s chariot hastens toward dawn—\nSurely the mortal world has long attained longevity.\nThe four seas bustle, yet one remains at leisure,\nEach mouth speaks of worldly dust.\n\nKnowing you possess the Dao, I come to this mountain—\nHow could nameless obscurity compare to dwelling in the world?\nTwelve towers and terraces conceal secret formulas,\nWithin five thousand words lies hidden the Mysterious Pass.\n\nOnly then is it known that the crucible stores the elixir of stars,\nBegging but a single *daogui* grain to behold.\nSevering the bonds of splendor, casting aside glory,\nFrom the first attainment, one is everlasting.\n\nOnce by the brocade waters, a cicada’s molt was left behind,\nAgain at Penglai, a name was shed.\nThrice journeying, untouched by fortune or misfortune,\nA speck of dust lingers in the world’s affections.\n\nUnknowing where the fulfilled merit leads,\nOne rides the azure dragon straight to Jade Capital.\nIn those years, poetry’s worth filled the imperial capital,\nYet with a careless wave of the arm, the true man departed west.\n\nAlone, he possessed ten thousand acres of white clouds,\nWho else might claim a branch of the immortal osmanthus?\nCasually, the fisherman of Wei’s bend beckoned,\nDrunk, he ascended Lotus Peak, supported by a Daoist.\n\nOne day, we shall meet again,\nBy the bamboo stream and thatched hut, calling through the night.\n\nThe golden hammer gleams, dancing upon the celestial steps,\nAlone, he rides the dragon, departing and returning.\nHigh he reclines in the white clouds, observing the sun’s cavern,\nLeisurely he slumbers beneath the autumn moon, cleaving the heavens.\n\nThe *li* flower, petal by petal, is born of heaven and earth,\nThe *kan* medicine, fluttering, is shaped by creation.\nEvening drunk among the nine peaks, turning to gaze—\nBeneath the northern dark mountain, bones lie pale.\n\nFriendship is ever deep with those of the Dao,\nAs sun and moon follow them, rising and setting.\nTo suffer longing for the crane beyond the clouds,\nOne must forge the gold within the water with resolve.\n\nWhen the elixir is complete, the cosmos may seem too narrow,\nYet once ingested, what fear of illness or harm?\nNot yet departed to the Jasper Terrace, still mingling in the world,\nNo harm in a cup of wine, delighting in idle verse.\n\nBy chance, embracing lute and sword, descending through misty vines—\nWhat fortune to pass through this day!\nComparisons are all alike, yet seem fitting,\nBut acupuncture and medicine yield little effect.\n\nThe immortal classics have been read—three thousand scrolls,\nAncient methods once held—twelve disciplines.\nIf these minor immortal recipes are doubted,\nStep forth on the golden steps and see for yourself.\n\nOverturning Huayang in drunken revelry again and again,\nRiding the dragon at dusk, descending to the southern ramparts.\nBrows furrowed, striking the sword like streaking meteors,\nRobes, from sleeping amid clouds, cling to emerald mist.\n\nThe golden liquid transforms into rain and dew,\nReturning to the Jade Capital, the aged pines and cedars.\nOnce, an iron mirror was used to illuminate spirits and ghosts,\nThunder rumbled, searching as water filled the pool.\n\nThe iron mirror smelted gold as fire filled the sky,\nBeyond the azure pool, dragons danced in the evening sun.\nThe qilin’s intent harmonized with heaven and earth,\nThe mechanism of dew and mist lay in the sun and moon’s east.\n\nA three-foot sword lay across the twin rivers’ banks,\nA five-spiked crown atop the hundred spirits’ palace.\nLeisurely spreading kingfisher plumes to bind the spirit’s cave,\nDonning golden lotuses to enact creation’s work.\n\nFollowing karmic deeds, drifting and sinking,\nLike water or cloud, a single heart.\nTwo scrolls of Daoist scriptures, a three-foot sword,\nA flowering staff, a seven-stringed zither.\n\nWithin the gourd, medicine awaits to be given to others,\nIn the belly, new poems meet travelers to be recited.\nA single bite of mercury adds a thousand years of life,\nA single pill of elixir transmutes a catty of gold.\n\nHalf-drunk before the forked path, how many autumns have passed?\nRiding dragons and phoenixes, forever without care.\nKings, ministers, and chancellors are not loved—\nOnly the *kan* and *li* are the wondrous tally.\n\nAlone seated on Penglai, observing the cosmos,\nDrawing the sword from the brow, roaming the seas.\nWitnessing injustice stirring within the heart,\nResolving grievances, avenging shame, taking heads.\n\nLute, sword, wine, and chess—dragon, crane, and tiger,\nCarefree and untroubled, forever without worry.\nLeisurely riding the white stag through the three isles,\nAt times driving the green ox across the ten continents.\n\nFrom afar in the azure grotto, the bright moon rests in the palm,\nHigh in the green mountains, concealed beside the clouds.\nIf mortals wish to be thus,\nLet fame and profit’s floating splendor be cast aside at once.\n\nWithin the Purple Tenuity Palace, I know myself,\nSharpening the spirit-sword until it flies of its own accord.\nFirst dispatching jade lads to open the southern hall,\nThen sending the green dragon into the northern darkness.\n\nNine crucibles harbor the Yellow Sprout, where the sleeping phoenix roosts,\nA single immortal’s frame nurtures the numinous fungus.\nPeng Isle is no place for mortals to dwell—\nOnly fear the foolish may leak the world’s secrets.\n\nTurning the body, one at last emerges from the dust,\nThe work of creation lies solely in man.\nEarly, the exalted dragon casts off the earth’s net,\nHow could the White Tiger emerge from the celestial truth?\n\nEndless the path—who would detain me?\nSilent, wordless, naturally merging with the divine.\nStriking the sword by night, where does one return?\nClad in stars and moonlight, slaying the qilin.\n\nWatching idly as blossoms fall,\nEach sword dance met with a sigh.\nEver anxious that the white sun’s light hastens time,\nEver resentful that the azure heavens’ road is distant.\n\nThe original intent sought neither fame nor profit,\nThe primordial heart only admired water and mist.\nThe world’s myriad affairs drift and sink—\nWho understands principle as does my family?\n\nTen thousand matters in the world drift and settle,\nWho attains reason like my household?\n\nThe sun unfolds its explanations, the moon sighs its cinnabar,\nThe lords of Hua-Xia behold with mortal eyes.\nBenevolence and righteousness differ as Hu and Yue differ,\nWorldly sentiments are as hard to fathom as Mount Tai and Mount Heng.\n\nThe Eight Immortals refine and forge to final creation,\nThe Four Seas grind and polish, their gaze cold and piercing.\nWhat is level yet not level—ten thousand times ten thousand,\nStriking the sword, riding the dragon to the Ninth Heaven.\n\nSince parting, the rising waters drown the east wind,\nDrunken eyes, lingering emotions—weary or not?\nThe golden sword roars, shaking heaven and earth,\nThe jade crucible seals the boiling of sun and moon.\n\nStaff in hand, three thousand *li* to the lands of Chu,\nCrane’s wings span ten thousand layers over Qin’s rivers.\nTo report to the immortal of Jin City:\nWe shall meet again in spring’s hues at Lotus Peak.\n\nShaven head, blood dripping, eyes like forge-fire,\nBreath exhaled, clouds rise—rage at the world’s questions.\nIntolerable, the thousand injustices of this age,\nMust seek a single decisive strike to sweep away the fierce and stubborn.\n\nWhere the flood-dragon is slain, the seas churn,\nWhen the raging tiger is felled, distant mountains are uprooted.\nTo extinguish the heartless and betrayers of virtue,\nThe sword’s light, star-stained, leaves its marks.\n\nRain and snow fall thickly, the sky already dusk,\nGolden goblets filled, soothing the scorched paulownia.\nPoems chanted at the feast, not a moment passed,\nThe sword dances before the banquet, swift as the wind.\n\nWhy does one’s conduct ever linger past midnight?\nSuddenly, eyes blazing, one leaps into the void.\nWho knows who lacks loyalty and filial piety?\nA head is seized and brought to the seat.\n\nThree feet of frost and wind—ghosts and spirits grieve,\nWith wide sleeves and tall cap, one attains freedom.\nOverjoyed, one boasts and sings the songs of Yue,\nEnraged, the brows arch, drawing the sword of the heavens.\n\nSince leaving the three isles of the azure sea,\nOne no longer visits the vermilion gates of the five marquises.\nHalf-drunk, one rolls up sleeves and stands defiant,\nAsking who harbors grievances so grave.\n\nBefore refining the elixir, refine the heart,\nOnly when the cinnabar is complete does one grasp the source of the Dao.\nOften, guests are kept with money to buy wine,\nWho believes one lacks the medicine to transmute gold?\n\nWithin the cave, wind and thunder are grasped in the palm,\nIn the gourd, sun and moon rest in the breast.\nThe work of immortals is hard for men to comprehend,\nCultivating nature, attaining long life—one hums to oneself.\n\nThe iron ox plows the earth, sowing golden coins,\nThe stone boy strings them through.\nA single grain of millet holds a world,\nHalf a *sheng* of the cauldron boils mountains and rivers.\n\nThe white-bearded elder’s brows touch the ground,\nThe blue-eyed barbarian points to the sky.\nIf you can fathom this mystery,\nBeyond this mystery, there is no further mystery.\n\nThe *Ji* star and *Xu* constellation descend from the long sky,\nHow can the common scene not be marveled at?\nThe dragon emerges from the water, its scales complete,\nThe crane soars to the heavens, its feathers whole.\n\nTeaching transformation amidst the dust, a thousand eyes watch,\nYet in the world, few understand the *Erya*.\nIt is only that the common folk’s fortune and fate are meager,\nThey cannot bear to lightly transmit the subtle and wondrous.\n\nAt leisure, one swings an arm and enters the Gate of Heaven,\nSweeping the sleeves, slowly gathering the colored clouds.\nSilent, one gazes down at the Yellow Valley’s child,\nSmiling, one bows to the Purple Mist Lord.\n\nPlanning to linger by the Jade Palace, leaning on gold,\nReturning to visit Yingzhou, watching the sun’s decline.\nJust as the Moon Goddess holds her feast,\nThe nectar newly brewed, its fragrance wafting.\n\nOnce followed Liu and Ruan, drunk in Peach Blossom Spring,\nYet to wake in the mortal world, still owing wine money.\nA hempen robe serves for now,\nWhen the sun returns from the Ninth Heaven, it shall be repaid.\n\nPhoenix-feathered robes are not prized,\nEven the white fox’s fur cannot compare.\nThis alone is the world’s priceless treasure—\nIf not, try burning it in fire to see.\n\nReflecting on past events, one grows bold,\nHaving read the *Thousand Character Classic*, the thirteenth chapter.\nWhen Empress Wu died, she was a maiden,\nWhen King Chen perished, he was a boy.\n\nTwo chariots of sun and moon, let them bear the load,\nNine rivers’ guesses hang from a single eave’s pole.\nAll day, no one speaks of news,\nA pot of spring wine, one drinks to intoxication.\n\nSleeves hanging, one soars beyond the world’s dust,\nA gourd carried, one roams several times.\nFame and profit, outside the body, are not the Dao,\nAt the Dragon-Tiger Gate, discern the true.\n\nUnwittingly, the dream-soul journeys to the Purple Palace,\nFor years, one’s traces have hidden in the dust of the world.\nIf we meet again in Huayin’s market,\nIt will not be as an ordinary medicine-seller.\n\nTen thousand scrolls of immortal scriptures, a three-foot zither,\nLiu An, hearing of this, is a kindred spirit.\nA staff’s tip holds spring’s hues, a pot of wine,\nIn the crucible, cinnabar—not transmuted gold.\n\nSeveral times, drunk and sleeping at the mountain’s mouth,\nAt leisure, one fishes the heart of Dongting.\nHow many times have we met and encountered?\nOnly fear that, soaring to the heavens, there will be no place to seek.\n\nOnce battled Chi You before the Jade Palace,\nSix dragons high, the jade chimes resounding.\nBehind the south-pointing chariot, the golden drums followed,\nBeside the black turtle banner, the iron-crowned marched.\n\nDrunk, clutching the black beard, the three isles darkened,\nEnraged, drawing the frost-edged sword, the ten continents chilled.\nAfter the age of the Yellow Emperor’s reign,\nOne has long sought the deep and stern, yet found it hard.\n\nHair wild as waves, voice like a bell,\nFace like ice and snow, bones like pine.\nIn the scabbard, the treasured sword roars ceaselessly,\nIn the sleeve, the golden hammer displays martial prowess.\n\nWhen drinking, one is a companion and singer,\nWhen chanting poems, one delves into the *Cantong Qi*.\nIn recent years, one is bound for the Kunlun feast,\nRiding a fierce, nine-colored dragon.\n\nThe gates of immortals open to the Yellow Palace,\nThe gates of generals and ministers to the White Jade Capital.\nIf even the caves lack fine scenes,\nWhat remains in the world but the multitudes?\n\nCarrying the zither, one strolls idly, following the crane,\nIn the scabbard, the sword gleams with rosy clouds, awaiting the slaying of the whale.\nAdvancing or retreating, neither is lost,\nI leave it to you to point the way forward.\n\nWorldly sentiments, like yin rain, seem to isolate,\nLightning flashes, thunder shakes the eight directions.\nLong gone, the chaotic mountains add mist and dew,\nNot coming to the level earth to save the withered and emaciated.\n\nThe spring’s hues of Yuan and Rong linger in the echoes,\nThe autumn winds of construction harm the traveler’s path.\nPlaying with the three questions, the thatched hut is broken,\nAt the moment, how many years will one see?\n\n**Seven-character quatrains**\n\nAutumn’s scene desolate, leaves scatter in flight,\nBeneath the courtyard pine’s shadow, time passes as one sits.\nClouds obscure the crane’s chariot—where has it gone?\nThe immortal’s cave at dawn misses my appointed time.\n\nSeizing the golden essence to make the foundation of life,\nAt the sun’s eastern edge, the moon’s western glow.\nWithin it, refine the elixir of long life,\nConsuming it, one becomes equal to heaven and earth.\n\nMorning chases floating fame, evening discards it,\nWithin the cave, the sun and moon—I am the sky.\nIn the scabbard, the treasured sword roars ceaselessly,\nNot meeting a man of resolve, it vows not to be transmitted.\n\nThe sword rises, stars flee, executing ten thousand *li*,\nWind and thunder follow, the sound of rain prevails.\n\n**The man’s head rolls yet his words remain,**\nStriding high, chanting past the Five Lakes.\n\"Master! Master!\"—his visage fierce and grim,\nHe draws his sword to strike where clouds err.\nThree sharp shouts ring out in rapid succession,\nWith a *clang*, the man falls empty into the void.\n\n\"Master! Master! Do not tarry,\nThe Dao must be passed, the sword held in reverence.\nToday we meet by the sea’s edge,\nLet us hasten to the village wine and roam as one.\"\n\nHis brows bristle, fierce spirit surging,\nA single bound—ten thousand *li* through the sky.\nThe three-foot sword in the scabbard on his back,\nHeaven’s blade to slay the unjust.\nSharpening the green-wind three-foot sword,\nThe golden hammer in his sleeve, never wielded in vain.\nIf one is a man of resolve, he must be repaid,\nHow could he let others say he is no true man?\n\nWith bushy brows and towering resolve, his voice like thunder,\nHearing of grievances, he sets down his cup.\nSword in hand, he soars a thousand *li* through the sky,\nParting at the first watch, returning by the second.\nThis morning, rising in the pitch-black dark,\nA thousand *li* to avenge, all in an instant.\nFrom his sleeve, he pours out a dead man’s head,\nHis mouth still muttering, *\"De, de.\"*\n\nBy South Mountain’s edge, we meet again,\nGrasping hands, earnest words ring like bells.\n\"Since you mastered the sword after we parted,\nWhere there are dragons, you slay dragons.\"\nHalf a day’s journey spans the world,\nNo need to ride phoenix or mount dragon.\nBy chance, in a game of skill, his divine sword flew,\nShattering the first peak of Zhongnan.\nMorning roams Nanyue, evening Cangwu,\nHis sleeve holds a green serpent, his gall bold.\nThrice entering Yueyang, none recognize him,\nChanting aloud as he flies past Dongting Lake.\n\nTo study the Dao, one must be utterly poor,\nA few coins only in his purse.\nIf one asks of my method of cultivation,\nI point afar to the sun and moon on the horizon.\nUnbetraying the Three Lights, unbetraying men,\nNeither deceiving the divine nor the destitute.\nIf one asks of my method of cultivation,\nOnly tend the field of the heart to nurture this body.\nThree *mu* of cinnabar field, no seeds to sow,\nWhen planting, one must have the Red Dragon plow.\nI once taught others to sow this child,\nBut without understanding cultivation, the Dao does not grow.\n\nNo need for matchmakers to seek without,\nThe Returned Elixir is gathered within the body.\nDo not say the Great Dao is hard to attain,\nIt is only that one’s effort has not reached its peak.\nDrink wine—let it be a hundred cups,\nEastward bound, floating like a matchmaker’s ladder.\nIf the essence of the sun unites with the moon’s glow,\nA bright pearl will rise.\nFlickering, tiger and dragon, divine beings take flight,\nRely on this body’s work—do not go astray.\nWhen transmitting, it must be with the power of heaven and earth,\nThen penetrate the Three Clarities, pass through the Purple Tenuity.\n\nIn the depths of the Primal Sea, life’s pivot lies hidden,\nWithin dwells the Yellow Lad, the Jade Emperor’s Lord.\nThe White Snow Divine Talisman conceals the Maiden of Nü,\nThe Spirit’s Origin is guarded by the Ten Lords of Yuan.\nDo not wonder why news from Jasper Pool is rare,\nOnly because worldly affairs veil heaven’s mechanism.\nIf one finds fire within water,\nA Jade Lad ascends to the Great Subtlety.\n\nClapping hands, dancing with gourd,\nCrossing ridges, piercing clouds, his staff flies.\nComing and going eight thousand *li* in half a day,\nBy the southern bank of Jinzhou, a pine gate stands.\nTipping the gourd, casting aside the zither,\nHe strides straight up Ox-Crouching Peak.\nWater flies on stone, bursting like snow,\nStanding to gaze at heaven, sitting to chant.\n\nThe flask like gold, the jade child yellow,\nAscending and descending, replenishing divine sustenance.\nThe Three Origins unite in a year of stillness,\nIn this heaven, the sun and moon endure long.\nThe Elbow-Transmitted Cinnabar Script—a thousand-year art,\nReciting the *Yellow Court* in two scrolls.\nIn the crane’s abode, the ancient altar within the locust’s shade,\nNo human trace, the door ever ajar.\n\nMy home originally dwells in Heaven’s Pivot,\nScattered white clouds lock the stone steps.\nPenglai’s eastern sea lies beyond ten thousand *li*,\nYet I return as before, the path unerring.\nThe Lotus Peak Daoist, lofty and pure,\nNever descends from Lotus Peak through the years.\nAt night, he bows to the stars, his jade hairpin cold,\nAt dawn, dragon and tiger open the golden tripod, seething.\n\nI myself forget the spirit, my heart delights,\nStriding over water, piercing clouds to visit.\nI do not ask of the Yellow Sprout or the Elbow’s Prescription,\nHow can the wondrous Dao’s subtlety be spoken?\nIf men of this age wish to go to Yingzhou,\nFirst pass the towering Twelve Towers.\nThere, thunder and lightning roar,\nA pool of golden water flows eastward.\n\nAlone on the high mountain, gazing at the Eight Capitals,\nAfter the black clouds scatter, the moon remains solitary.\nIn the boundless cosmos, men numberless,\nHow few true men are men of resolve?\n\nThe fire-wheel, small, emerges from the divine continent,\nStraining to bear it with an iron ox.\nWith a red heart, bearing it to Kunlun’s summit,\nWho knows the Returned Elixir is called the Purple Journey?\n\nNurture the spirit-root with essence, the spirit with *qi*,\nBeyond this truth, there is no other truth.\nThe immortals are unwilling to speak plainly,\nThus misleading thousands upon thousands of men.\n\n---\n\n**Five-character regulated verse**\n\nThe twenty-four gods are pure,\nThree thousand merits and deeds complete.\nCold clouds connect to the earth’s axis,\nThe sacred sun fills the sky with light.\nThe Prince’s Son is most fit to plant,\nHow could the golden field be tilled?\nWithin this, the true wondrous principle—\nWho says one cannot attain long life?\n\nThe Dao is penetrated, the Mysterious again penetrated,\nIts name left to spread across the four seas.\nFriends rely on a single staff,\nLivelihood—two empty fists.\nSeeking fruit, hesitating to plant,\nThinking of wine, instantly coining sacred money.\nWho knows that coming to blend with the world,\nIs not again to turn away from heaven?\n\nWondrous, wondrous within the wondrous,\nMysterious within the mysterious, even more mysterious.\nIn movement and speech, all expound the Dao,\nIn silence, all become immortals.\nIn the palm, like a pearl, strange,\nIn the sky, the moon gleams bright.\nWhen one’s merit is complete in time,\nStraight to the Great Luo Heaven ascend.\n\n*The Pure Yang Perfected One’s Thoroughly Accomplished Collection, Volume the Lower, concludes.*",

      "translated_text": "**The Perfected One of Pure Yang’s Spontaneous Compositions**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Perfected One of Pure Yang’s Spontaneous Compositions*\nAuthored by Lü Pure Yang of the Tang dynasty. Two fascicles.\nSource edition: *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Tradition*, Supreme Mystery Section.\n\n**Preface to *The Perfected One of Pure Yang’s Spontaneous Compositions***\n\nI observe that the ancients did not compose with intent, and thus their words arose from sincerity, preserving the great essence in full. Later generations, however, wrote with the aim of fame, so their words surpassed their true feelings, and ornamental flourishes prevailed.\n\nThe great essence is rooted in spontaneity, while ornamental flourishes arise from contrivance. Spontaneity aligns with Heaven, whereas contrivance is shaped by human artifice. The expression of the heart’s voice knows no bounds—its distinctions are self-evident without speech.\n\nBehold: it blazes forth as sun and moon, manifests as the Milky Way, coalesces into mountains and rivers, scatters as grasses and trees. Gazing above and below, the myriad forms stand in perfect array—all are the patterns of Heaven and the principles of Earth. Yet in the great transformations of Heaven and Earth, where is there room for deliberate intent? They arise without speech, transform without action, for there is an inevitability that unfolds of itself.\n\nOur patriarch, the Perfected One Lü Pure Yang, mastered the learning that bridges Heaven and humanity, wielding the mechanism of creation itself. His words flowed effortlessly from his lips, his brushstrokes formed chapters without strain—never the product of cunning thought or calculated design, but rather the spontaneous effusion of celestial impulse, an irresistible outpouring.\n\nIn his exhortations to the world, he adapted his teachings to all circumstances, his language plain yet his meaning profound. Those who read them find their doubts dissolved like melting ice, their minds at ease in the natural order. Greed is tempered, shallowness deepened, and the heart stirs with thoughts of leaving the dust of the world behind.\n\nIn his sword-condemning verses, he borrowed objects to illuminate truth, his qi bold and his spirit unbound. Those who read them feel their four limbs released, their spirits clear and their qi at ease. The filth is scraped away, the light polished, and the mind soars with longing for the heavens.\n\nThe Transcendent Elder’s divine transformations were boundless, his manifestations infinite. His writings, scattered among the people, cannot be fully gathered or exhaustively presented. Yet within the repository of the canon, I have found over two hundred of his poems and verses, which I have arranged into two fascicles, naming them *Spontaneous Compositions*—for they are perfectly formed by Heaven, beyond the reach of human artifice.\n\nThe stewards of the Pure Yang Abbey have proposed carving woodblocks to disseminate this work widely, that all under Heaven may share in it. Thus, they have asked me to compose this preface. Though I am unworthy, I have reluctantly complied, offering these rough outlines.",

      "translated_text": "Within these verses, ambiguities akin to miswritten characters may appear here and there. How dare I presume to alter them with my own judgment? What is doubtful shall be transmitted as doubtful, awaiting the discernment of the wise.\n\nAlas! If one can seek the poet’s heart through his poems, grasp his conduct through his heart, and from his conduct ascend to the Dao of the sages—might this not approach the Way? I cannot help but place my hopes in the keen and learned.\n\nWritten on the full moon of the intercalary tenth month in the year *qing-xinhai*, by the Pure and True Daoist of Tiaoyang, He Zhiyuan, with bowed head and reverent salute.\n\n**Preface.**\n\n**Volume One of *Spontaneous Compositions* by the Pure Yang Perfected**\n**Twenty-Nine Seven-Character Regulated Verses of Exhortation to the World**\n\nOne must not cling to the clamor of the dust;\nWithin this illusory body dwells the Dharma-body.\nDo not hoard brocade in your breast,\nBut cherish your spirit amid the world’s snares.\n\nReturn, and seek the songs of the immortals;\nIf lost, you’ll ne’er escape the bonds of the mundane.\nI tell this to the wise and heroic:\nDo not let your original truth be obscured.\n\nRiding the whale, he emerges from Dongting Lake—\nWho recognizes the carefree hermit weary of the world?\nTen thousand golden lotuses bloom in primordial chaos,\nA single moon of the heart mirrors the Void.\n\nHe seeks not to dwell in the Yellow Gold Palace,\nBut only that men abide in the White Jade Flask.\nWith a green serpent tucked in his sleeve, he departs,\nHis phoenix flute sounding as he treads the celestial capital.\n\nStarlight gleams, resplendent in verse,\nHis body drifts with idle clouds, leaving the imperial realm.\nA single elixir refined beyond the world,\nA hundred poems raved in drunken ecstasy.\n\nWithin the flask-sky lies the land of eternal spring,\nOn the island of immortals, is there no hall of endless night?\nHe treads the path beyond the azure clouds,\nProud as Fuxi in the ninth heaven.\n\nBeneath towering trees, their shade deepens the sunset glow,\nThe finest mountains belong to the Daoist’s home.\nCold ashes warm the cauldron, flames rekindle,\nWithered trees take root again, blossoms bloom.\n\nThe rise and fall of the mortal world are finite,\nBut the years of the jade palace stretch boundless.\nHeavenly winds stir jade pendants to chime,\nAs he soars to and fro in a purple phoenix chariot.\n\nFailing to awaken, the world remains coarse and clamorous,\nReturning empty-handed from the mountain of treasures.\nAt the temples, black hair turns to snow,\nThe rosy face, in an instant, becomes ashen.\n\nStrive to compose a thousand-year tune in your heart,\nFor the four illusions have never granted a day’s respite.\nHow many aspirations, inscribed on pillars and bridges,\nAre yet imprisoned by the gate of life and death?\n\nThe cloud-wandering Daoist lives at ease,\nThe yellow dust beyond his gate never dries.\nHis mind-seal transmits the moon a thousand miles,\nHis topknot bears the Five Peaks and the Seven Stars’ crown.\n\nHe unfolds secret scrolls, burning incense as he recites,\nPlucks the zither to his shadow, for none know its tune.\nThe red-crested crane stirs by the alchemical furnace—\nOne might suspect a golden elixir has taken flight.\n\nThe Void is vast, boundless,\nYet only the divine radiance ascends and descends.\nA single poetic soul, newly forged of qi,\nThe five-thousand-word teaching, an old family tradition.\n\nWhile deluded, study the ways of the mortal world;\nWhen enlightened, cultivate deeds beyond the physical.\nSpread your wings to ride the wind and return—\nDo not let yourself be easily trapped in the cage of the ordinary.\n\nMajestic and vast, descending from the celestial court,\nThe withered scene stirs melancholy.\nThe willow camp lies deep, mosquito legions thick,\nThe Yangtze’s waves stretch wide, mirage towers loom.\n\nWine banners twist like battle standards,\nFlutes and drums echo as war drums.\nCountless souls chase fame and profit—\nHow many will glimpse true peace?\n\nThe red gates must not long delay;\nBefore profit grows, harm has already multiplied.\nDo not let your sharp wit become a sword,\nBut calm your heart and still the winds of strife.\n\nThe bee, in its folly, gathers flowers into honey;\nThe silkworm dies—who will weave its cocoon into silk?\nWealth gained unjustly is greed’s gain—\nWhat end awaits such floating clouds?\n\nSee through the workings of fate’s ebb and flow,\nEmpty your heart and live at ease.\nMoonlight fills the peaks above and below,\nSpiritual forms traverse the seven-jeweled mountains.\n\nGathering heaven and earth into your palm,\nYou move the sun and moon, shaking the celestial gates.\nThe teeming masses remain unseen—\nA single mysterious pearl shines in the world.\n\nThe dream of yellow millet ends, all things cease,\nMist and waves hide the mirage towers.\nAfter three thousand days of refining lead and mercury,\nHe leaps beyond yin and yang, eight hundred autumns.\n\nHis sword hangs south of the Dipper, north of the Chief Star,\nHis qi spans the heavens, brushing the moon’s edge.\nHe came grasping a flawless mirror,\nHigh in the azure sky, yet unwilling to withdraw it.\n\nThe weave of yin and yang holds the power of creation,\nYet the human heart is often restless.\nSuddenly, the Milky Way becomes a river of clouds,\nThe snowy sky turns to rain.\n\nThe ice-fish steals warmth, floating on jade wings,\nThe plum blossom, in the cold, vies in beauty.\nPity the fleeting scene of eternal spring—\nWho will bring it to the world?\n\nThe crane’s path stretches far,\nIts song compels, its purity overwhelms.\nThe plum’s soul is stolen by the wind,\nThe bamboo’s shadow is cast by the moon.\n\nThe good mountain is known to delight the benevolent,\nFine wine suits the old man’s heart.\nWith whom shall I escape the net of the world,\nAnd wander the paradise gardens in peace?\n\nI recall riding the wind beneath the jade canopy,\nFragrant clouds thickly veiling the dragon chariot.\nI awaited the gathering of immortals in the Penglai gardens,\nDrunk, I slept in the mountain hermit’s home.\n\nZhuang Zhou’s butterfly dream is truly savored,\nThe deer mistaken for Zheng’s minister—how lamentable!\nWho can grasp this mystery’s delight,\nAnd together sail the Silver River on a moonlit night?\n\nDo not neglect the spiritual source, plant descendants,\nPreserve the mandate of return and the root of home.\nWithdraw, and do not summon the Shushan courtesans,\nHold simplicity, and do not open the northern sea’s cup.\n\nThe purple phoenix has not yet ridden to the crimson palace,\nThe black-robed one has already shed the red gates.\nI wish you would not steal the starving people’s grain,\nBut follow me to repay the Jade Emperor’s grace.\n\nThe blessings of past lives are seen in the present,\nThe causes of future lives are observed now.\nOnly after three lifetimes of wisdom does one become an official,\nOnly after five births of clarity does one hold office.\n\nDo not plant thorns in the garden of your heart,\nDo not let weapons loose from your wit’s tip.\nTake up the sword of wisdom and return—\nSpare yourself the battles of hunger and cold.\n\nHalf-drunk, half-sober, I leave the divine capital,\nThe rivers and mountains remain dim, the sky unbright.\nDharma rain briefly follows the torrential downpour,\nCompassion clouds idly drift with the evening mist.\n\nThe dust of the world has settled,\nBeyond the physical, the Dao’s power flourishes in hidden growth.",

rod vainly cast toward the sea’s heart.\n\nA single line dangles fragrant bait,\nOn Qili Shoal’s rocks, the angler sits.\nBright moon fills the sky o’er crimson shores,\nClear wind brushes sleeves of green straw cloak.\nWater cold, night still—no fish are caught,\nLaughing, he points to the Yangtze and sighs *shiwei*.\n\nSun and moon hasten forth, then return west,\nTurning heads, the years flow by the hundreds and thousands.\nDo not chase yin demons to dissolve cinnabar,\nBut refine golden lead within the elixir crucible.\nIn the dust, fear only tardy retreat;\nBeyond the physical, act swiftly first.\nShatter this hollow void,\nThen brush your sleeves and ascend the clouded peaks.\n\nA limpid stream from the ancient numinous source,\nUnsullied by even a speck of dust.\nBright, bright—like the radiant moon,\nLeisurely, leisurely—as idle clouds.\nSplit open heaven and earth’s cage and net,\nLeap beyond yin-yang’s creative pass.\nIn the mundane realm, some may briefly awaken—\nTurning the light inward, home lies before your face.\n\nThe true nature was ever free,\nLet not worldly affairs forcibly confine it.\nIn the waves of right and wrong, best seal your lips;\nIn the arena of fame and gain, withdraw your head.\nDebts to kin and karmic ties—now settled,\nThe paths of life and death—now at rest.\nBeneath the azure crags and verdant pines, carefree,\nWatching fading blossoms drift upon the stream.\n\nA pellet of elixir, long refined to joy,\nShines brilliantly, high as Kunlun’s peaks.\nThe benevolent cauldron tames dragon and tiger,\nOpening the furnace startles ghosts and gods.\nVast enough to embrace heaven and earth—yet still too narrow,\nFine as dust and sand—yet not too full.\nTouch a stubborn stone, and gold is made;\nWhy then do men fail to attain immortality?\n\nThe Dragon Spring sword, forged without counting autumns,\nPreserves the Dharma-nature in perfect wholeness.\nDivine radiance leaves its sheath, illuminating sun and moon,\nCold flames pierce the clouds, striking the Dipper and Ox.\nWielded, it purifies the ten directions and three realms;\nBrandished, a hundred demons and myriad fiends lament.\nSent by decree from the Celestial Capital,\nIt is bestowed upon the valiant of the human world.\n\nBefore Yellow Crane Tower, the Lü family’s home,\nA gourd holds heaven and earth, aging with rosy clouds.\nFormless white deer harmonize with crimson phoenixes,\nA black tortoise coils around a scarlet serpent.\nIn June, white snow flies on mountain peaks;\nIn midwinter, yellow sprouts grow beneath the waters.\nIf men but recognized these principles,\nLand-bound immortals would swarm like hemp.\n\nEyes meet a thousand differences, ten thousand things—\nYet a single point before the breast anchors serene leisure.\nKnowing the truth is like the moon in meditation,\nNever return empty-handed from the treasure mountain.\nWide sleeves sweep away affliction’s barriers,\nStraw sandals tread through the gates of life and death.\nOnce this move is set in place,\nNo longer subject to yin-yang’s playful questions.\n\nRosy clouds drift, veiling the immortal palace,\nVast qi surges, filling the great void.\nA lotus stem holds the Milky Way’s moon,\nThe roc soars ten thousand miles on sea and mountain winds.\nSpiritual light reflects beyond primordial heaven,\nThe perfect circle embraces the Great Dao.\nNearby stands the White Prime Lord,\nYet worldly men, lost in busyness, cannot fathom him.\n\nAdvancing, do not covet what is unjust;\nRetreating, recognize your original truth.\nPractice compassion, accumulate boundless merit;\nCurb desire, spare your finite body.\nGreen temples can only turn to white hair,\nRed dust never again meets youth’s spring.\nIf you fully grasp these wild words,\nBecome a carefree being beyond the physical.\n\nWho among the Luofu Daoists shares this path?\nClad in grass, fed on wood, they scorn kings and lords.\nThe world’s sixty-year cycles cannot bind them,\nWithin their gourds, heaven and earth are free.\nCounting moves in a lingering chess game as the river moon dawns,\nA long whistle heralds autumn over sea and mountain.\nAfter drinking, turning to speak of the return,\nThey point afar to white clouds at the sky’s edge.\n\nThe celestial net is vast, myriad forms sparse—\nA single pine falls, and Mount Hua withers.\nAfter cold clouds disperse, a waning moon remains;\nWhen winter snow arrives, it vanishes into the void.\nTen caves’ dragons and serpents return to the Purple Palace,\nA thousand years’ simurghs and phoenixes alight on Cangwu.\nSince parting from the Master,\nNorth, south, east, west—few true men remain.\n\n**Five-Character Regulated Verse**\n\nNight still on the cold river,\nLine reeled in, waves gather.\nAlas, too few fragrant baits,\nVainly watching brocaded scales teem.\nPlanning to turn the boat back,\nYet still ensnared by the scene.\nLingering beneath the bright moon,\nIn vain, the old fisher’s cloak.\n\nTo reach the realm of cultivating truth,\nOne must rely on the power of creation.\nThe Azure Dragon swallows purple mist,\nThe White Tiger exhales blue smoke.\nLuminous qi rises through the three realms,\nYang light pierces the nine springs.\nA single pellet of elixir is complete—\nReturning to the state before birth.\n\n**Seven-Character Quatrains**\n\nDo not prize glory and cling to ministerial rank,\nIn forests and springs, one may hide anywhere.\nYou know those who once fled Qin—\nNow dwell as people within Peach Blossom Spring.\n\nRed gates pilfer profit, endlessly scheming,\nComing as foam, going as waves.\nEven reaching the Jade Hall as chief minister,\nWho today remains like Xiao He of Han?\n\nFelling the numinous root, exhausting true essence,\nBeneath the skull’s face, seeking spirit.\nMeeting, all say they seek immortality—\nYet who has ever seen one on Penglai Isle?\n\nGathering true essence, nurturing the elixir,\nThe inch of heart unobstructed, naturally at ease.\nWhen merit is complete and conduct fulfilled, longing for return,\nA purple phoenix delivers a letter to the world.\n\nGrass’s shade fades, earth’s thunder roars,\nStars and constellations stretch across ten thousand miles.\nCalling back Pure Yang to its rightful place,\nJust before noon, the third watch is heard.\n\nA human life spans ten thousand kalpas of cultivation,\nWhy toil endlessly for family worries?\nIn the end, leave it to sons and grandsons to reckon—\nWhat reason to labor like oxen and horses?\n\nDragons weary of roaring, tigers of roaring,\nThe general still has not doffed his armor.\nFurious winds sweep the earth, overturning heaven,\nShaking the cosmos, killing qi soars high.\n\nShatter the void and seize it at once,\nSeizing it is best for one’s livelihood.\nNot seeking the head-covered path of silent meditation,\nMocking the old masters who came from the West.\n\nDo not boast of youth’s gallantry,\nStriving and struggling, trading in bones.\nIf unconvinced, try gazing into a bright mirror—\nBeneath the skin, only a skeleton remains.\n\nWhen the heart turns from avarice, contemplate

unpeaceful.\n\nWooden idols, clay statues—still forms in quietude,\nLet the mind’s realm remain unstained by even a speck of dust.\nSilent and profound, without interruption,\nThis flavor accords with the Perfect Truth.\n\nAsk not of the clamor in the marketplace,\nFor beyond its dust lie misty mountains.\nIf only the heart’s square inch remains free of the slightest shadow,\nOne gains a realm of leisure within the celestial gourd.\n\nXiao He of Han was buried in the earth,\nCao Zhi’s literary fame brought him only sorrow.\nReflecting on this desolate world,\nIt is far better to return home.\n\nI admire the white-haired elder, so worthy,\nA man of kindness, refined in manner and bearing.\nHow might one invite him to ride the wind away,\nTo become master of the clouds and mountains?\n\nChildren’s clothing and sustenance are sought by children,\nIn vain does greed force one to thrust forward.\nOnly when sorrow arrives and years come to an end,\nDoes resentment turn level ground into barren mounds.\n\nLiving in humble poverty is no disgrace,\nWhile lofty prominence is no true strength.\nObserve the days of peace and tranquility—\nWho remains, and who has perished?\n\n**Against Wine**\nBeware wine, beware wine,\nPreserve the primal radiance within.\nSoaring freely to the Jade Capital Peak,\nHeaven and earth brew nectar aplenty.\n\n**Against Lust**\nBeware lust, beware lust,\nThe moment desire arises, the primordial spirit perishes.\nNaturally, in the Jade Hall of matrimony,\nA single spark of spirit outshines a thousand feet of snow.\n\n**Against Greed**\nBeware wealth, beware wealth,\nLet it not bury the world’s people in suffering.\nWithin the Seven Treasures of one’s own forest,\nA true person builds a tower of jade.\n\n**Against Anger**\nBeware wrath, beware wrath,\nIt may be gentle but must not be abandoned.\nOne day, when it surges and transforms into the primordial spirit,\nIt will ascend the azure heavens to pay homage to the Jade Emperor.\n\n**Against Sorrow**\nBeware sorrow, beware sorrow,\nHow long will the relentless pursuit of fame and profit last?\nGlory, wealth, and honor—how long can they endure?\nWhen the limit arrives, how can they be retained?\n\n**The Heart-Sword**\nI possess a Longquan sword, sheathed and hidden,\nIts light polishes men’s livers and gallbladders, brightening their spirits.\nOnce drawn and raised in the central palace,\nDemons a thousand miles away dare not stand before it.\n\n**The Heart-Seal**\nCold light, unmoving, naturally so,\nAdapting to all, now square, now round.\nOnce stamped, one knows there is no \"that,\"\nThis life is but the state before birth.\n\n**The Heart-Mirror**\nHigh upon the spirit terrace, long unpolished,\nIt naturally reflects the ten thousand forms.\nLet dust settle without blowing—\nIf blown, what does the dust reveal?\n\n**The Heart-Lamp**\nA single flame of the heart-lamp burns brightly,\nNo need to tend it—it shines of itself.\nWhen obtained, it illuminates the darkness of the world,\nRadiating cold light throughout the Great Purity.\n\n**The Heart-Moon**\nA single wheel of the heart-moon adheres to the celestial court,\nThe hare’s spirit and toad’s soul are exceptionally clear.\nEven a wisp of idle cloud cannot obscure it,\nIt penetrates heaven and earth, perfectly round.\n\n**The Heart-Ground**\nThe heart-ground requires no laborious plowing,\nIn stillness, the sprouts of the Dao alone grow.\nOnce I have filled all its ravines,\nIt rests in serene tranquility, a level expanse.\n\n**The Most Profound Song**\nWhy did I spend six years on Snow Ridge?\nWith resolve firm, harmonizing qi and spirit.\nIn a hundred moments, all is but a single breath—\nOnly then does the Great Dao reveal the Three Vehicles.\n\nThe Jade Emperor sent me to transform the foolish,\nYet the world’s people remain distant from the Dao.\nThe four seasons stealthily steal the treasures of the body,\nThe five agents openly plunder the pearls upon the face.\n\nYear after year, the pursuit of fame and profit persists,\nDay by day, right and wrong depart and vanish.\nTurning back, I return to the path of the Three Isles,\nLest the Emperor send down a celestial talisman.\n\nRefining cinnabar through nine cycles of firing,\nThe fire’s timing naturally unfurls the child’s blossom.\nFrom the stars, the blue lotus seed is forged,\nBeneath the sun and moon, the white horse’s sprout is nurtured.\n\nSeven returns transform into verdant mist,\nNine reversals culminate in crimson clouds.\nWhoever seizes the Mysterious Pearl as sustenance,\nFinds the path to the Three Isles not far.\n\nIn the West, the Jade Maiden gives birth to golden sprouts,\nFor heaven and earth’s fire burns of itself.\nThe Water Tiger lies beneath the clouded mountains,\nThe Fire Dragon scatters its hues across the sea.\n\nWhen the yang soul flourishes, heaven is not distant,\nAs the yin spirit conjoins, earth is not far.\nOnce merit is complete, the five colors naturally arise,\nRiding the simurgh, one freely ascends the cloudy heavens.\n\nHeaven engenders one flavor, transforming the Three Powers,\nAs yin and yang interact, the sacred embryo forms.\nDragon and Tiger proceed in order, the yin ghost flees,\nTortoise and Serpent reverse course, the Fire Dragon arrives.\n\nThe infant shares the golden marrow,\nThe Crone pours the white jade cup.\nOnce merit is complete, one naturally transcends the mundane,\nIn the world, the cycles of cold and heat pass unheeded.\n\nStars gather in the Li region,\nThe waxing and waning of sun and moon aid the Medicine King.\nFor three periods, fire refines the golden tripod’s treasure,\nFive talismans and water temper the jade flask’s nectar.\n\nHeaven and earth overturn, the Dragon brings rain,\nAt Mao and You, the Tiger devours and radiates light.\nEntering the chamber, employ the mechanism to seize and capture—\nA single pill of cinnabar, the medicine of pure yang.\n\nThe Eight Trigrams communicate with Kan and Li,\nWhen Zhen and Dui interact, the Two Modes unite.\nWhen taking action, seize the moment of supremacy,\nRefine and fire until ripe—do not delay.\n\nEighty-one years within the womb,\nTo refine pure yang through eighty-one cycles.\nRiding clouds by day, returning to the upper realms,\nEven now, I wander and rest in the Purple Tenuity Palace.\n\nWithin the gourd, the Four Images are naturally divine,\nYet they are said to rule the people for ages.\nThough employing weapons to pacify the cosmos,\nThe two wheels of sun and moon still traverse ceaselessly.\n\nWhy labor with multitudes to still the world?\nNorth and south doors now stand open to each other.\nThis employs none other than Dragon and Tiger,\nEightfold divine light shines through to the very bottom.\n\nEach must arise from each,\nTrue gold meets and contends.\nWhere the yang soul ends, yin must disperse,\nTransforming into the essence of heaven and earth, sun and moon.\n\nThe Five Agents must pair as husband and wife,\nThe Kan man and Li woman—few understand.\nWhen the two bodies interact and harmonize,\nThen the Elder of Bing becomes the true elder.\n\nYear after year, the method for changing bones differs,\nOne must refine Dragon and Tiger at the center.\nWhen merit is complete, it takes but three thousand days,\nBlood transforms into jasper, marrow into frost.\n\nThe essence of the Five Agents is contained within one,\nArranged in cycles, awaiting the fire’s timing.\nOnly when water returns to the spirit chamber,\nDoes one ascend from level ground to the azure heavens.",

affairs—\nLaughing, point to the white clouds’ comings and goings.\n\n---\n\n**Song of the Fallen**\nFallen, ah fallen—\nAt night, lodging in rustic villages,\nBy day, roaming the city walls.\nWhen idle, I wander the verdant mountains,\nWhen bored, peddle elixirs in the marketplace.\n\nThe coins I earn, not counted,\nSpent on fine wine, poured for myself.\nDrunk, my chants shake ghosts and

his body like silver.\nHis temples show no gray—he has the art,\nHis complexion stays young—he has attained the divine.\n\nNow is the time to ascend Penglai,\nThe yellow robes on the rack turn to clouds.\nThough mulberry fields may turn to seas,\nA single pill of elixir secures a thousand springs.\n\n**Refining Cinnabar**\nThe furnace nurtures cinnabar—no gray at the temples,\nWhy trouble with fame and profit, dwelling among men?\nI have met the perfected and received the divine medicine,\nAnd rejoice with fellow seekers, smiling as we move.\n\nLaozi’s Dao has been entrusted to me,\nThe Lesser Star permits me to ascend with it.\nFortunate to be gathered by the lofty ones,\nIn this world, I yield to you a life of leisure.\n\n**Who Waits for Immortality?**\nWho waits for immortality to be bestowed upon me?\nI refine true qi within the immortal embryo.\nI know well that I shall ascend to heaven in broad daylight,\nYet I have just descended into the red dust of the world.\n\nWhen the White Tiger moves, rain and dew pour,\nWhere the Red Dragon plows, jasper and jade appear.\nSwallow but a single grain of cinnabar medicine—\nI shall soar into the azure clouds and never return.\n\n**The Hidden Sage**\nAmid the tumbled clouds, the starry capital appears,\nDiscerning the deeply concealed true man.\nDrunk on green wine, he sleeps through sun and moon,\nWhen the white duckweed’s wind stills, he fishes by rivers and lakes.\n\nEver aligning his bearing with heaven’s Dao,\nHe does not waste words on the world’s paths.\nThe mountain and water roads are distant, none reach them—\nDo the reeds and thatch hold any news?\n\n**The Crane as Chariot**\nThe crane serves as chariot, wine as provisions,\nTransforming this into the land of long life, undying.\nEven earth’s

wish to meet him in person,\nDay after day, they must not leave the path of mercury.\n\n**The Magic Mushroom**\nThe magic mushroom has no seed, no root,\nYet it can be drunk, consumed, and revive the soul.\nAs long as mist and rosy clouds sustain the years,\nLet the crow and hare race through the cosmos.\n\nThe infant only clings to the mother in the yang,\nThe crone must face the honored one atop her head.\nOnce attained, it does not return for a thousand ages—\nNo tombs or graves will be left for descendants.\n\n**Who Understands These Words?**\nWho in this world understands these words?\nDo not hang fame and profit upon your heart’s field.\nCasually pour out wine to the full,\nWhen inspired, chant a hundred verses.\n\nBeyond the world, mist and rosy clouds are my companions,\nWithin the gourd, sun and moon follow the fair one.\nWhen the time comes and merits are complete, where shall I return?\nI shall ride the cloud chariot straight into the grotto-heaven.\n\n**The Emperor’s Son of the Mysterious Gate**\nThe Emperor’s Son of the Mysterious Gate sits at the center,\nHis life long and luminous, moved by the Jade Sovereign.\nThe world’s mountains and rivers harmonize with rain and

husband and wife can hold fast to their resolve,\nThey shall establish teachings to entangle yin and yang.\n\n**Retreat from the Mortal Frame**\nHow many years have passed since I shed my mortal frame?\nBeyond the high green peaks, I feed on the mysterious frost.\nAncient snow on the blue mountains encircles my pine couch,\nCold clouds from the immortal’s palm refine the stone chamber.\n\nI often climb the shell-paved towers to pluck tender jade herbs,\nAt times I break fragrant osmanthus in the Moon Palace.\nBrilliant as brocade, it once opened for me—\nPermitting me to wander the Five Emperors’ realm.\n\n**A Whistle Toward the Distant Peak**\nPointing afar to the high peak, I let out a whistle—\nRed radiance and purple mist arise before my face.\nOften in the dusty market, none

drunk, I chant.\nSun and moon secretly support your chronicles,\nHeaven and earth naturally befriend me.\n\nSpirits vanish at the trace of the Three Clarities’ sword,\nWind and rain soar as I play my zither.\nWhere shall I return after my southern journey?\nDo not let the crane depart to seek me in heaven.\n\nSpring arrives, I wander to the immortal’s home,\nWhere doors display extraordinary February blossoms.\nThe cyclical stems reveal your life’s work,\nThe cyclical branches fulfill your destiny—no need for boasting.\n\nEach possesses a pure, numinous nature beyond heaven,\nHow could one forget the turbid and cast aside arrogance?\nIf you grasp the thousand-day effort,\nYou shall return after ten thousand years into mist and rosy clouds.\n\nCloud-like tresses gleam, my bones grow lighter,\nI say I seek the crane to reach Penglai and Yingzhou.\nDiscussing herbs and music all day, I know their savor,\nAsking of immortals, I learn all their names.\n\nOn clear nights, the azure dragon pierces the emerald grotto,\nIn cold repose, I lie high in the White Silver City.\nCome spring, I shall again take up my staff to depart,\nRecalling Xuanyuan’s journey upon the sea.\n\nDragon essence and tortoise eyes harmonize,\nThe sixteen-foot lad cannot endure.\nNine cups of water simmer the Red Child,\nA single wheel of fire nurtures the yellow sprout.\n\nThe moon, full, naturally dissolves the heavenly net,\nOnly when merits are complete does one know how to escape the earthly snare.\nHalf-drunk, I happily swallow phoenix marrow,\nI urge you, no longer mistake the fleeting for the eternal.\n\nForcing myself to dwell in this scene, bereft of kindred spirits,\nThough wild scenes abound, they do not suit my chant.\nIf my verses clamor in the ears of ministers,\nMy name shall stir the hearts of emperors.\n\nThe Dao has no sash, I sleep alone,\nFlowered bamboo hat and bark crown, I am too lazy to don.\nBeyond this, I have no other affairs—\nA pot of rustic wine, a zither.\n\nWithin Huayang Mountain lie many fields of mushrooms,\nThe old man of Huayang Mountain further extends his years.\nBeneath the towering boughs by the verdant pine mounds,\nI drink the flying spring amid white clouds.\n\nNeither cold nor hot, my spirit sways,\nComing from the west, departing to the east, my qi flows gently.\nWhen three thousand merits are complete, it is time to return,\nDo not speak of the grotto-heaven to worldly folk.\n\nHeaven-born, the natural heart does not scatter,\nSuccess and failure have ever been thus, from ancient times to now.\nThose who find the path know all shall transcend the world,\nThe deluded forever sink in vain.\n\nThe supreme joy at one’s side demands refinement,\nBeyond things, the cinnabar sand must be carefully sought.\nThe immortal’s realm lies within the grotto chamber, a hand’s span away,\nDo not follow the waves and squander your radiance.\n\nI have hidden in the Mysterious Capital, forgetting spring,\nHow many times has the azure sea turned to dust?\nWithin the Jade Capital’s hall, I paid homage to the Primordial One,\nIn the Golden Gate Palace, I bowed to the Old Lord.\n\nWhen bored, I ride the thousand-year crane,\nWhen at leisure, I soar beyond the nine heavens’ clouds.\nNow I have learned the art of longevity,\nYet I am not willing to pass it on to the world.\n\nGazing within the palms of the Northern Emperor and Southern Star,\nI secretly penetrate creation’s mysteries.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** *Kan* (坎) and *Li* (离) refer to the trigrams representing Water and Fire in the *Yijing*, often symbolizing yin and yang forces in Daoist internal alchemy. *Six-and-One* (六一) may refer to the Six-and-One Mudrā or a specific alchemical formula. *Red Child* (赤子) and *Yellow Sprout* (黄芽) are technical terms in Daoist internal alchemy, symbolizing purified essence and generative energy. *Jade Capital* (玉京) and *Purple Tenuity* (紫微) are celestial realms in Daoist cosmology. *Three Clarities* (三清) refers to the highest Daoist heavens. *Xuanyuan* (轩辕) is the Yellow Emperor, a legendary Daoist immortal. *Cyclical stems* (甲子) and *branches* (庚申) refer to the traditional Chinese sexagenary cycle used in divination and timekeeping. *Huayang* (华阳) is a sacred mountain in Daoist tradition. *Primordial One* (元始) and *Old Lord* (老君) are epithets for Laozi and other Daoist deities.",

grasps the Mysterious Pass?\n\nBrightly the Dao abides, awaiting its reckoning;\nBy the shoals of sun and moon, it departs and returns.\nWithin the radiance of daylight, it merges with nature,\nAs thunder races and lightning strikes the Central Plain.\n\nEver riding the crimson steed, dwelling in the Eastern Hall,\nGrandly unsealed the vermilion gates, floating upon azure springs.\nFiercely drawing the Kunwu blade to sing of sagely transformation,\nJoyfully accompanying the solitary moon to celebrate the new year.\n\nOnly then is it known as the immortals’ treasure,\nBestowed solely upon the virtuous for transmission.\nSix dragons in unison hail ascension to Qian,\nTheir horns subtly wielding the power of creation.\n\nThe true Dao often hums beneath the pale autumn moon,\nThe profound word ever flows through the chill jade waves.\nBy day, riding the white stag through Peng Isle,\nBy night, crowned in gold, standing atop the ancient altar.\n\nA single year yields the elixir of a thousand ages—\nWho would sully their sleeves with the dust of the mortal realm?\nUpon the shoals of the Five Peaks, the scene renews,\nThe virtuous one alone attains the formless body.\n\nHeavenly songs convey the Dao as the Three Origins settle,\nEarth’s veins pulse, bringing forth the myriad beings.\nAwaken to the Valley Spirit and cultivate this Way,\nCease discourse on principle and seek the real.\n\nBrightly expounded along the path of the Central Yellow,\nAmidst the thunder’s roar, one attains the divine.\nLonging to join the immortal maidens, the body grows light,\nSoaring past Penglai to reach the Highest Clarity.\n\nCrimson-crested cranes arrive from beyond the clouds,\nPurple-scaled fish welcome from the sea’s depths.\nChang’e’s tender osmanthus blooms first,\nThe Queen Mother’s immortal peaches gradually ripen.\n\nGazing down, the sun’s chariot hastens toward dawn—\nSurely the mortal world has long attained longevity.\nThe four seas bustle, yet one remains at leisure,\nEach mouth speaks of worldly dust.\n\nKnowing you possess the Dao, I come to this mountain—\nHow could nameless obscurity compare to dwelling in the world?\nTwelve towers and terraces conceal secret formulas,\nWithin five thousand words lies hidden the Mysterious Pass.\n\nOnly then is it known that the crucible stores the elixir of stars,\nBegging but a single *daogui* grain to behold.\nSevering the bonds of splendor, casting aside glory,\nFrom the first attainment, one is everlasting.\n\nOnce by the brocade waters, a cicada’s molt was left behind,\nAgain at Penglai, a name was shed.\nThrice journeying, untouched by fortune or misfortune,\nA speck of dust lingers in the world’s affections.\n\nUnknowing where the fulfilled merit leads,\nOne rides the azure dragon straight to Jade Capital.\nIn those years, poetry’s worth filled the imperial capital,\nYet with a careless wave of the arm, the true man departed west.\n\nAlone, he possessed ten thousand acres of white clouds,\nWho else might claim a branch of the immortal osmanthus?\nCasually, the fisherman of Wei’s bend beckoned,\nDrunk, he ascended Lotus Peak, supported by a Daoist.\n\nOne day, we shall meet again,\nBy the bamboo stream and thatched hut, calling through the night.\n\nThe golden hammer gleams, dancing upon the celestial steps,\nAlone, he rides the dragon, departing and returning.\nHigh he reclines in the white clouds, observing the sun’s cavern,\nLeisurely he slumbers beneath the autumn moon, cleaving the heavens.\n\nThe *li* flower, petal by petal, is born of heaven and earth,\nThe *kan* medicine, fluttering, is shaped by creation.\nEvening drunk among the nine peaks, turning to gaze—\nBeneath the northern dark mountain, bones lie pale.\n\nFriendship is ever deep with those of the Dao,\nAs sun and moon follow them, rising and setting.\nTo suffer longing for the crane beyond the clouds,\nOne must forge the gold within the water with resolve.\n\nWhen the elixir is complete, the cosmos may seem too narrow,\nYet once ingested, what fear of illness or harm?\nNot yet departed to the Jasper Terrace, still mingling in the world,\nNo harm in a cup of wine, delighting in idle verse.\n\nBy chance, embracing lute and sword, descending through misty vines—\nWhat fortune to pass through this day!\nComparisons are all alike, yet seem fitting,\nBut acupuncture and medicine yield little effect.\n\nThe immortal classics have been read—three thousand scrolls,\nAncient methods once held—twelve disciplines.\nIf these minor immortal recipes are doubted,\nStep forth on the golden steps and see for yourself.\n\nOverturning Huayang in drunken revelry again and again,\nRiding the dragon at dusk, descending to the southern ramparts.\nBrows furrowed, striking the sword like streaking meteors,\nRobes, from sleeping amid clouds, cling to emerald mist.\n\nThe golden liquid transforms into rain and dew,\nReturning to the Jade Capital, the aged pines and cedars.\nOnce, an iron mirror was used to illuminate spirits and ghosts,\nThunder rumbled, searching as water filled the pool.\n\nThe iron mirror smelted gold as fire filled the sky,\nBeyond the azure pool, dragons danced in the evening sun.\nThe qilin’s intent harmonized with heaven and earth,\nThe mechanism of dew and mist lay in the sun and moon’s east.\n\nA three-foot sword lay across the twin rivers’ banks,\nA five-spiked crown atop the hundred spirits’ palace.\nLeisurely spreading kingfisher plumes to bind the spirit’s cave,\nDonning golden lotuses to enact creation’s work.\n\nFollowing karmic deeds, drifting and sinking,\nLike water or cloud, a single heart.\nTwo scrolls of Daoist scriptures, a three-foot sword,\nA flowering staff, a seven-stringed zither.\n\nWithin the gourd, medicine awaits to be given to others,\nIn the belly, new poems meet travelers to be recited.\nA single bite of mercury adds a thousand years of life,\nA single pill of elixir transmutes a catty of gold.\n\nHalf-drunk before the forked path, how many autumns have passed?\nRiding dragons and phoenixes, forever without care.\nKings, ministers, and chancellors are not loved—\nOnly the *kan* and *li* are the wondrous tally.\n\nAlone seated on Penglai, observing the cosmos,\nDrawing the sword from the brow, roaming the seas.\nWitnessing injustice stirring within the heart,\nResolving grievances, avenging shame, taking heads.\n\nLute, sword, wine, and chess—dragon, crane, and tiger,\nCarefree and untroubled, forever without worry.\nLeisurely riding the white stag through the three isles,\nAt times driving the green ox across the ten continents.\n\nFrom afar in the azure grotto, the bright moon rests in the palm,\nHigh in the green mountains, concealed beside the clouds.\nIf mortals wish to be thus,\nLet fame and profit’s floating splendor be cast aside at once.\n\nWithin the Purple Tenuity Palace, I know myself,\nSharpening the spirit-sword until it flies of its own accord.\nFirst dispatching jade lads to open the southern hall,\nThen sending the green dragon into the northern darkness.\n\nNine crucibles harbor the Yellow Sprout, where the sleeping phoenix roosts,\nA single immortal’s frame nurtures the numinous fungus.\nPeng Isle is no place for mortals to dwell—\nOnly fear the foolish may leak the world’s secrets.\n\nTurning the body, one at last emerges from the dust,\nThe work of creation lies solely in man.\nEarly, the exalted dragon casts off the earth’s net,\nHow could the White Tiger emerge from the celestial truth?\n\nEndless the path—who would detain me?\nSilent, wordless, naturally merging with the divine.\nStriking the sword by night, where does one return?\nClad in stars and moonlight, slaying the qilin.\n\nWatching idly as blossoms fall,\nEach sword dance met with a sigh.\nEver anxious that the white sun’s light hastens time,\nEver resentful that the azure heavens’ road is distant.\n\nThe original intent sought neither fame nor profit,\nThe primordial heart only admired water and mist.\nThe world’s myriad affairs drift and sink—\nWho understands principle as does my family?\n\nTen thousand matters in the world drift and settle,\nWho attains reason like my household?",

piercing.\nWhat is level yet not level—ten thousand times ten thousand,\nStriking the sword, riding the dragon to the Ninth Heaven.\n\nSince parting, the rising waters drown the east wind,\nDrunken eyes, lingering emotions—weary or not?\nThe golden sword roars, shaking heaven and earth,\nThe jade crucible seals the boiling of sun and moon.\n\nStaff in hand, three thousand *li* to the lands of Chu,\nCrane’s wings span ten thousand layers over Qin’s rivers.\nTo report to the immortal of Jin City:\nWe shall meet again in spring’s hues at Lotus Peak.\n\nShaven head, blood dripping, eyes like forge-fire,\nBreath exhaled, clouds rise—rage at the world’s questions.\nIntolerable, the thousand injustices of this age,\nMust seek a single decisive strike to sweep away the fierce and stubborn.\n\nWhere the flood-dragon is slain, the seas churn,\nWhen the raging tiger is felled, distant mountains are uprooted.\nTo extinguish the heartless and betrayers of virtue,\nThe sword’s light, star-stained, leaves its marks.\n\nRain and snow fall thickly, the sky already dusk,\nGolden goblets filled, soothing the scorched paulownia.\nPoems chanted at the feast, not a moment passed,\nThe sword dances before the banquet, swift as the wind.\n\nWhy does one’s conduct ever linger past midnight?\nSuddenly, eyes blazing, one leaps into the void.\nWho knows who lacks loyalty and filial piety?\nA head is seized and brought to the seat.\n\nThree feet of frost and wind—ghosts and spirits grieve,\nWith wide sleeves and tall cap, one attains freedom.\nOverjoyed, one boasts and sings the songs of Yue,\nEnraged, the brows arch, drawing the sword of the heavens.\n\nSince leaving the three isles of the azure sea,\nOne no longer visits the vermilion gates of the five marquises.\nHalf-drunk, one rolls up sleeves and stands defiant,\nAsking who harbors grievances so grave.\n\nBefore refining the elixir, refine the heart,\nOnly when the cinnabar is complete does one grasp the source of the Dao.\nOften, guests are kept with money to buy wine,\nWho believes one lacks the medicine to transmute gold?\n\nWithin the cave, wind and thunder are grasped in the palm,\nIn the gourd, sun and moon rest in the breast.\nThe work of immortals is hard for men to comprehend,\nCultivating nature, attaining long life—one hums to oneself.\n\nThe iron ox plows the earth, sowing golden coins,\nThe stone boy strings them through.\nA single grain of millet holds a world,\nHalf a *sheng* of the cauldron boils mountains and rivers.\n\nThe white-bearded elder’s brows touch the ground,\nThe blue-eyed barbarian points to the sky.\nIf you can fathom this mystery,\nBeyond this mystery, there is no further mystery.\n\nThe *Ji* star and *Xu* constellation descend from the long sky,\nHow can the common scene not be marveled at?\nThe dragon emerges from the water, its scales complete,\nThe crane soars to the heavens, its feathers whole.\n\nTeaching transformation amidst the dust, a thousand eyes watch,\nYet in the world, few understand the *Erya*.\nIt is only that the common folk’s fortune and fate are meager,\nThey cannot bear to lightly transmit the subtle and wondrous.\n\nAt leisure, one swings an arm and enters the Gate of Heaven,\nSweeping the sleeves, slowly gathering the colored clouds.\nSilent, one gazes down at the Yellow Valley’s child,\nSmiling, one bows to the Purple Mist Lord.\n\nPlanning to linger by the Jade Palace, leaning on gold,\nReturning to visit Yingzhou, watching the sun’s decline.\nJust as the Moon Goddess holds her feast,\nThe nectar newly brewed, its fragrance wafting.\n\nOnce followed Liu and Ruan, drunk in Peach Blossom Spring,\nYet to wake in the mortal world, still owing wine money.\nA hempen robe serves for now,\nWhen the sun returns from the Ninth Heaven, it shall be repaid.\n\nPhoenix-feathered robes are not prized,\nEven the white fox’s fur cannot compare.\nThis alone is the world’s priceless treasure—\nIf not, try burning it in fire to see.\n\nReflecting on past events, one grows bold,\nHaving read the *Thousand Character Classic*, the thirteenth chapter.\nWhen Empress Wu died, she was a maiden,\nWhen King Chen perished, he was a boy.\n\nTwo chariots of sun and moon, let them bear the load,\nNine rivers’ guesses hang from a single eave’s pole.\nAll day, no one speaks of news,\nA pot of spring wine, one drinks to intoxication.\n\nSleeves hanging, one soars beyond the world’s dust,\nA gourd carried, one roams several times.\nFame and profit, outside the body, are not the Dao,\nAt the Dragon-Tiger Gate, discern the true.\n\nUnwittingly, the dream-soul journeys to the Purple Palace,\nFor years, one’s traces have hidden in the dust of the world.\nIf we meet again in Huayin’s market,\nIt will not be as an ordinary medicine-seller.\n\nTen thousand scrolls of immortal scriptures, a three-foot zither,\nLiu An, hearing of this, is a kindred spirit.\nA staff’s tip holds spring’s hues, a pot of wine,\nIn the crucible, cinnabar—not transmuted gold.\n\nSeveral times, drunk and sleeping at the mountain’s mouth,\nAt leisure, one fishes the heart of Dongting.\nHow many times have we met and encountered?\nOnly fear that, soaring to the heavens, there will be no place to seek.\n\nOnce battled Chi You before the Jade Palace,\nSix dragons high, the jade chimes resounding.\nBehind the south-pointing chariot, the golden drums followed,\nBeside the black turtle banner, the iron-crowned marched.\n\nDrunk, clutching the black beard, the three isles darkened,\nEnraged, drawing the frost-edged sword, the ten continents chilled.\nAfter the age of the Yellow Emperor’s reign,\nOne has long sought the deep and stern, yet found it hard.\n\nHair wild as waves, voice like a bell,\nFace like ice and snow, bones like pine.\nIn the scabbard, the treasured sword roars ceaselessly,\nIn the sleeve, the golden hammer displays martial prowess.\n\nWhen drinking, one is a companion and singer,\nWhen chanting poems, one delves into the *Cantong Qi*.\nIn recent years, one is bound for the Kunlun feast,\nRiding a fierce, nine-colored dragon.\n\nThe gates of immortals open to the Yellow Palace,\nThe gates of generals and ministers to the White Jade Capital.\nIf even the caves lack fine scenes,\nWhat remains in the world but the multitudes?\n\nCarrying the zither, one strolls idly, following the crane,\nIn the scabbard, the sword gleams with rosy clouds, awaiting the slaying of the whale.\nAdvancing or retreating, neither is lost,\nI leave it to you to point the way forward.\n\nWorldly sentiments, like yin rain, seem to isolate,\nLightning flashes, thunder shakes the eight directions.\nLong gone, the chaotic mountains add mist and dew,\nNot coming to the level earth to save the withered and emaciated.\n\nThe spring’s hues of Yuan and Rong linger in the echoes,\nThe autumn winds of construction harm the traveler’s path.\nPlaying with the three questions, the thatched hut is broken,\nAt the moment, how many years will one see?\n\n**Seven-character quatrains**\n\nAutumn’s scene desolate, leaves scatter in flight,\nBeneath the courtyard pine’s shadow, time passes as one sits.\nClouds obscure the crane’s chariot—where has it gone?\nThe immortal’s cave at dawn misses my appointed time.\n\nSeizing the golden essence to make the foundation of life,\nAt the sun’s eastern edge, the moon’s western glow.\nWithin it, refine the elixir of long life,\nConsuming it, one becomes equal to heaven and earth.\n\nMorning chases floating fame, evening discards it,\nWithin the cave, the sun and moon—I am the sky.\nIn the scabbard, the treasured sword roars ceaselessly,\nNot meeting a man of resolve, it vows not to be transmitted.\n\nThe sword rises, stars

pure,\nThree thousand merits and deeds complete.\nCold clouds connect to the earth’s axis,\nThe sacred sun fills the sky with light.\nThe Prince’s Son is most fit to plant,\nHow could the golden field be tilled?\nWithin this, the true wondrous principle—\nWho says one cannot attain long life?\n\nThe Dao is penetrated, the Mysterious again penetrated,\nIts name left to spread across the four seas.\nFriends rely on a single staff,\nLivelihood—two empty fists.\nSeeking fruit, hesitating to plant,\nThinking of wine, instantly coining sacred money.\nWho knows that coming to blend with the world,\nIs not again to turn away from heaven?\n\nWondrous, wondrous within the wondrous,\nMysterious within the mysterious, even more mysterious.\nIn movement and speech, all expound the Dao,\nIn silence, all become immortals.\nIn the palm, like a pearl, strange,\nIn the sky, the moon gleams bright.\nWhen one’s merit is complete in time,\nStraight to the Great Luo Heaven ascend.\n\n*The Pure Yang Perfected One’s Thoroughly Accomplished Collection, Volume the Lower, concludes.*",
      "overlap_context": "the foundation of life,\nAt the sun’s eastern edge, the moon’s western glow.\nWithin it, refine the elixir of long life,\nConsuming it, one becomes equal to heaven and earth.\n\nMorning chases floating fame, evening discards it,\nWithin the cave, the sun and moon—I am the sky.\nIn the scabbard, the treasured sword roars ceaselessly,\nNot meeting a man of resolve, it vows not to be transmitted.\n\nThe sword rises, stars flee, executing ten thousand *li*,\nWind and thunder follow, the sound of rain prevails.",
