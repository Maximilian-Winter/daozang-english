  "full_translation": "**The Upper Clarity Scripture of the Yellow Qi and the Three Yang Essence Circuits**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Upper Clarity Scripture of the Yellow Qi and the Three Yang Essence Circuits*, also known as *The Hidden Heaven and Concealed Moon*. Author unknown, approximately composed during the Eastern Jin dynasty. A foundational scripture of the early Shangqing tradition. One scroll. Base text from *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* section, *Benwen* category.\n\nThe Supreme Lord of the Southern Ultimate and Upper Primordial said: I have received the essentials of the Highest’s Three Circuits in Sequence, the Dao of the Yellow Qi and Yang Essence. By ingesting numinous radiance, sipping the imperial blossoms, and gazing upon the soaring roots, I store the Seven Luminaries within the Purple Effulgence, traverse the Three Paths at the Golden Gate, fathom the vast and narrow within the Abyssal Radiance, discern the square and round of the sun and moon, behold the Vermilion Stairs in the Cavernous Yang, enter to refine the intestines in the Broad Cold, ascend the Seven Treasures at the Dark Garden, climb the Flying Ladder at the Numinous Pass, return the Yang Essence to the Floating Black, gather the Yellow Qi from the Yüshāna, roam beside the Golden Wings on the Lofty Tree, and pass through the Stone Radiance to illumine the countenance. Through cultivating and mastering the numinous diagrams, I thus summoned the divine perfected ones. Thereupon, the Three Effulgences cast their light, the Seven Essences flanked my chariot, the Five Numinous Ones girded me with their sashes, the Four Directors composed their registers, the Western Tortoise fixed the records, and my name was inscribed in the Highest Dawn. Thus, I ascended to the rank of the Supreme Lord of the Southern Ultimate and Upper Primordial.\n\nThis Dao is lofty and wondrous, not something that mediocre men or narrow scholars may discuss. Now, I compile what I have received and roughly expound the Highest Jade Emperor’s arcane words to mark the mysterious and spontaneous numinous script, entrusting it to the Upper Minister, the Azure Lad, who oversees the records of the Mysterious Palace. After ten thousand kalpas, it shall be transmitted to those destined to receive the Mysterious Record on white slips and azure registers.\n\nSuch numinous scriptures and purple texts as the *Eightfold Simplicity Perfected Scripture*, the *Purple Clouds’ Inner Contemplation*, the *Sun’s Radiance within the Mysterious*, and others each speak of their respective practices, valuing only the ingestion and mastery of them, yet they cannot encompass their great root and origin, nor expand their vastness and dispersion. This may be called grasping the branches without fathoming the root, obtaining the Dao without attaining its source. Therefore, the study must be broadly pursued, requiring the mutual completion of above and below, the cultivation from beginning to end. When the Dao is complete and qi is abundant, there is none who shall not become immortal.\n\nThe sun’s breadth spans two thousand and forty *li*. Within it, golden essence and watery essence form halos, their flowing light illuminating the exterior. Within it are cities and people, seven-jeweled bathing pools, and four kinds of lotuses—blue-green, red, yellow, and white. The people are twenty-four feet tall, clad in vermilion robes, and they flourish and wither together with the four kinds of flowers. Thus, the four seasons—spring, autumn, winter, and summer—proceed therein.\n\nThe sun’s movement is governed by five winds: the Seasonal Wind, the Direct Wind, the Assisting Wind, the Revolving Door Wind, and the Traveling Wind. Therefore, the regulation and control of the sun, moon, and stars, their roaming through the void qi without cease, are all governed by the framework of these winds.\n\nThe waxing and waning of the sun and moon’s movements are all due to the convergence of the four seasons, the concealment and adornment of their crowns and sashes. Above the Golden Gate, the sun’s movement is unimpeded and luminous. Within the Golden Gate lies the pool of smelted golden essence, situated in the region of the Western Pass and Yéni. On the day of the Beginning of Spring, one receives the refinement of the hun-soul within the Golden Gate, its radiance shining without. At this time, the light and scene are gentle and fresh, the qi of all under heaven is warm, and this occurs once in the year, lasting forty-five days before ceasing. Each month, it naturally repeats five times, with a minor refinement of the Eight Rays above the Golden Gate, as the essentials are already detailed in the *Eightfold Simplicity Scripture*.\n\nProceeding in sequence to the Cavernous Yang Palace, the upper lodge of the sun, also called Líluó, situated in the region of the Floating Black. On the day of the Beginning of Summer, within the Cavernous Yang Palace, one exhales the essence of smelted gold to irrigate the palace, further refining the Eight Rays in the courtyard of flowing fire. At this time, the sunlight is dim yet intense, the yang qi overflows and scatters, and all under heaven is greatly hot. This occurs once in the year, lasting forty-five days before ceasing.\n\nProceeding in sequence to above the Eastern Well, the path through which the moon’s radiance communicates, situated in the region of Lù. On the day of the Beginning of Autumn, the sun bathes in the radiant halo within the Eastern Well, gathering the qi of the Eight Simplicities and returning to the Broad Cold Palace. At this time, the celestial scene is lofty and clear, the qi of all under heaven is cool, and this occurs once in the year, lasting forty-five days before ceasing.\n\nProceeding in sequence to the Broad Cold Palace, the upper lodge of the moon, the floral canopy of the Seven Stars, situated at the boundary of Yüshāna. On the day of the Beginning of Winter, the sun’s essence is concealed within the Broad Cold Palace, where it dons its crown and sash to nurture the embryo. At this time, the sunlight is yin, and all under heaven is cold. This occurs once in the year, lasting forty-five days before ceasing.\n\nIn one year, the sun’s movement completes its circuit, donning its crown and sash in the four directions, totaling one hundred and eighty days. These are the regions the sun traverses, while the remaining one hundred and eighty days belong to the moon’s movement. The two luminaries separate and unite, yin and yang wax and wane, each having its allotted measure and limit.\n\nWithin the Golden Gate stands the Lofty Soaring Tree, forty thousand *li* tall, its branches extending two thousand *li*, its girth two hundred and eighty *li*, and its roots plunging eight hundred and forty *li* deep. At its summit is [a figure] who ascends to heaven. The Jade Emperor, hearing of his valor and might, commanded him to guard the north, overseeing the position of Zhenwu, to sever the demonic and evil of the world.\n\nThe Perfected One addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: How may this divine general descend to the lower realm to subdue and eliminate demonic ghosts, deliver sentient beings, and spare them from violent deaths, thereby daily increasing their blessings? I humbly beseech the Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy to grant this request.\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy commanded the Jade Lad of the Right, who swiftly dispatched a true talisman directly to the north to summon the divine general Zhenwu. Upon receiving the summons, the general led his divine hosts directly before the Heavenly Worthy, kneeling and saying: Your servant has already received the Jade Emperor’s command to guard the north. Today, for what reason do I merit the sight of your compassionate countenance? I have been specially summoned by your talisman.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy spoke: While I was expounding the Dao in the Upper Prime Palace, suddenly the black poisonous grievance-qi of the lower realm surged upward into the celestial realm, startling the entire assembly. You should proceed there to subdue and eliminate the demonic forces, delivering and rescuing the wandering souls.\n\nThe divine general Zhenwu, respectfully receiving the Heavenly Worthy’s command, loosened his hair and went barefoot, treading upon the coiling serpent and the Eight Trigrams divine tortoise. He led his host of three hundred thousand divine generals, the Six Ding and Six Jia spirits, the Five Thunder divine soldiers, mighty dragons, lions, venomous dragons, and fierce beasts—all in procession before and behind—arriving together in the lower realm. Within seven days, the demonic forces throughout the world were all subdued and eliminated, separating humans from ghosts, dispersing vengeful souls, securing the peace of the living, and bringing tranquility to the land. The divine general Zhenwu and his assembled hosts then returned to the Upper Prime Palace and presented themselves before the Heavenly Worthy, saying: Yesterday, in obedience to your command, I descended to the lower realm to subdue and slay the demonic forces. By the power of your compassionate virtue, within seven days, all the malevolent spirits throughout the world were swept away.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: Excellent! Have you and the other deities not wearied yourselves?\n\nThereupon, the divine general Zhenwu crossed the Qian trigram to deploy the Dipper, pointing the Big Dipper’s handle with fierce energy, aiding the Celestial Pass, and intoned this incantation:\n\nBorn of the Great Yin, essence of the Water trigram,\nCorresponding above to the Void and Danger constellations,\nTortoise and serpent unite in form,\nCirculating through the Six Directions, might subduing the ten thousand spirits,\nNo darkness unperceived, no wish unfulfilled,\nAt kalpa’s end and kalpa’s dawn, severing and vanquishing demonic essences,\nRescuing and protecting all beings, bringing peace to households and nations.\nWhen in the cycle the final Jia day arrives and demonic qi flows,\nThe Supreme Emperor issues his decree—\nI descend in numinous power to propagate the true Dharma,\nDispelling evil and averting warfare, nurturing the multitudes,\nAiding the flourishing of the Middle Revival.\nShould any petty demon dare manifest,\nMy single gaze shall topple the Five Peaks.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and decrees!\n\nThe ritual invocation said:\n\nIn the Primordial Beginning, at the Supreme Simplicity,\nNo image, no form—\nNone knew the heavy and turbid,\nWho could discern the light and pure?\nWithin the chaos, I divided darkness and light:\nHeaven attained its vigor,\nEarth attained its tranquility,\nThe people attained their nurturance,\nAll things attained their sprouting,\nThe perverse attained rectification,\nThe spirits attained their numinosity.\nWithin the Three Powers, the myriad kinds all flourished.\n\nWhen the Great Simplicity dispersed,\nBenevolence and righteousness arose;\nWhen rites and music were established,\nDeceit and perversity spread.\nThe Six Relations were at times forsaken,\nThe Four Peoples contended.\nAbove, there was no magnanimity or forgiveness;\nBelow, no loyalty or integrity.\nSome were demons, some ghosts,\nSome goblins, some spirits—\nRampant and venomous,\nThey harassed and disturbed the living.\nEntire households fell to illness and misfortune,\nYears burdened by official punishments,\nWealth and goods dissipated,\nKin scattered and forlorn,\nLives cut short in vain,\nCalamities entwined.\nFoul and turbid qi ascended to the Celestial Court.\nThe Heavenly Honored One issued his decree:\nTo grant peace and stability,\nTo sever all goblins,\nTo boil all ghosts,\nTo bind the officers of pestilence in submission,\nTo extinguish the clarity of demonic spirits,\nTo topple and crush perverse demons.\n\nI command one hundred thousand mighty warriors,\nFifty million soldiers—\nAbove and below, in heaven and on earth,\nThey traverse twenty-four hundred *li*,\nEncircling two hundred eighty *li*,\nTheir roots delving eight hundred forty *li* deep.\nThose who partake of their fruit\nAssume the hue of golden radiance.\n\nAbove, there are golden-winged ravens,\nTheir wings encompassing the bounds.\nBelow, there is the Flowing Fire Courtyard,\nEighty myriad *li* in breadth and length.\nWithin it, the Eightfold Refined Spontaneous Mysterious Elixir glows with flame.\nAll the perfected immortals and ten thousand immortals,\nOn the day of the Beginning of Summer,\nGather in the Flowing Fire Courtyard,\nWithin the Eightfold Refined Mysterious Elixir,\nTo refine themselves anew,\nReceiving the fresh and unobstructed countenance of the hundred spirits.\n\nNone who later seek immortality\nFail to pass through the Cavern-Yang Palace,\nTo receive the Eightfold Refining and ascend to heaven.\nHaving completed the refining,\nThey partake of the blossoms of the Azure Void,\nAnd the golden-winged ravens weave their feathers into flying immortal garments,\nBestowed upon those who have undergone the refining,\nTo ascend the Nine-Phoenix Terrace of Jade Capital.\n\nAll advanced scholars of the Dao,\nWho ingest the Way of the Sun and Moon,\nOn the day of the Beginning of Summer at noon,\nTake eight *fen* of true pearls,\nAnd inscribe the Eightfold Refined Elixir-Womb Jade Talisman on yellow paper.\nThey cast it into clear water,\nBathe facing south,\nStand before the vessel,\nKnock their teeth twenty-four times,\nAnd softly recite the incantation as in the text for the Beginning of Spring.\nWhen finished, they draw in qi eight times and cease,\nReturn to their chamber to burn incense,\nMix the refined elixir with purple powder,\nEnclose the powder in a sachet,\nDust their bodies with it,\nRub their hands until warm,\nAnd wipe their faces and entire bodies.\nLying down with their heads to the south,\nThey knock their teeth nine times,\nClose their eyes, clench their fists,\nAnd visualize purple qi of sunlight layering upon layer,\nCrowning their bodies.\nThey envision themselves within the sunlight’s radiance,\nThe sunlight’s radiance revolving around their bodies,\nAscending to the Cavern-Yang Palace,\nAmidst the Azure Void’s forest,\nIn the Flowing Fire Courtyard.\nThey visualize the Perfected of the Southern Culmen, Cavern-Yang,\nWhose tabooed name is Fusion-Pearl,\nEight *cun* in height,\nClad in a crimson unlined robe,\nWearing the Sun-Essence Permeating-Yang Crown,\nHis mouth exhaling crimson qi, billowing like flames,\nTo burn their bodies.\nIn an instant, they pluck the blossoms of the Azure Forest\nAnd consume them.\nThe blossoms taste sweet,\nTheir bodies suffused with warmth.\nThey swallow qi eighty times and cease,\nThen softly recite the incantation:\n\n*\"The sunlight’s radiance spreads like gauze,\nWoven with the Mysterious Vault.\nFlowing fire surges and swells,\nMyriad streams raise their waves.\nThe Azure Forest is lush and verdant,\nGolden wings dance in graceful motion.\nEightfold Refined Vermilion Elixir,\nFragrant mushrooms in tranquil harmony.\nThe Four Golden Gates stand open,\nThe abode of the August Person.\nNuminous radiance emits its essence,\nI gaze upward to sip the flying blossoms.\nTo the left, I grasp the Mysterious Ascent;\nTo the right, I spur the demons to command.\nMy body ascends the lofty terrace,\nMy gaze sweeps across the emerald expanse.\nEight Sceneries wing through the clouds,\nPurple jasper and cinnabar mists.\nMy qi merges with the Jade Perfected,\nMy destiny equals the Numinous Branch.\nEver feasting in the Ninefold Mystery,\nThe path knows no peril or ruin.\"*\n\nWhen the incantation is finished,\nThey ingest the Eightfold Refined Elixir-Womb Jade Talisman,\nSwallow qi eighty times,\nAnd swallow saliva thirty-six times before ceasing.\n\nPracticing this Way,\nWhen lying down at dusk,\nThey must begin on the day of the Beginning of Summer,\nContinuing until the Beginning of Autumn.\nWith both palms, they rub their hearts,\nEighty times to the left and right,\nVisualizing the sun within their hearts,\nThe moon beneath their hearts,\nThe radiance of sun and moon illuminating their entire bodies.\nThey knock their teeth twelve times\nAnd recite the incantation:\n\n*\"At dawn, I wander the Azure Forest;\nAt dusk, I lodge in the Vermilion Terrace.\nFlowing fire stretches ten thousand rods,\nI receive the Jade-Womb of refinement.\nMy hun-soul is serene, my po-soul joyful,\nThe myriad spirits are at ease and content.\nThe sun’s extremity and moon’s eternity,\nThe Three Luminaries align in their time.\"*\n\nWhen the incantation is finished,\nThey lie down.\nPracticing this for eight years,\nThey enter fire unscathed,\nTheir faces assume a vermilion complexion,\nThey converse face-to-face with Fusion-Pearl,\nDraw down cinnabar mists,\nAnd ascend in flight to the Upper Clarity.\n\nWithin the Eastern Well,\nThere is the Hall of Vast Numinosity,\nWhere grows the Triple-Blossom Lofty-Ring Tree,\nFour thousand *zhang* in height,\nIts branches extending two thousand *li*,\nEncircling two hundred forty *li*.\nOnce in an eon, it produces the spontaneous blossoms of the Three Qi,\nResembling the radiance of hibiscus.\nPartaking of one blossom,\nOne’s years equal one eon.\n\nAbove, there are golden-winged ravens,\nTheir wings encompassing the bounds.\nBelow, there is the Spring of Azure Mushrooms and Jade Nectar,\nNamed the Eastern Well,\nNine myriad *zhang* deep,\nNine thousand *li* in breadth and length—\nThe spring from which the Spirit-King of the Sunrise Valley partakes.\n\nAll the perfected immortals and myriad emperors,\nOn the day of the Beginning of Autumn,\nGather at the Hall of Vast Numinosity,\nAt the Eastern Well’s spring,\nTo bathe and refine themselves anew,\nReceiving the unobstructed countenance of the perfected.\n\nNone who later cultivate the Dao to completion\nFail to visit the Eastern Well,\nTo bathe and refine themselves in the Jade Nectar’s spring,\nAnd ascend to heaven.\nHaving completed the refining,\nThey partake of the blossoms of the Three Qi,\nAnd the golden-winged ravens weave their feathers into flying immortal garments,\nBestowed upon those who have undergone the refining,\nTo ascend the Azure Palace of the Eastern Florescence.\n\nAll advanced scholars of the Dao,\nWho ingest the Way of the Sun and Moon,\nOn the day of the Beginning of Autumn at dusk,\nTake three *ge* of dragon fat (dragon bone is also excellent),\nAnd inscribe in azure ink the Ninefold Refined Dragon Radiance Talisman on white paper.\nThey combine and cast them into clear water,\nBathe facing east,\nStand before the vessel,\nKnock their teeth twenty-four times,\nAnd softly recite the incantation as in the text for the Beginning of Spring.\n\nWhen finished, draw in qi and swallow it nine times, then cease. Return to the chamber and burn incense. Grind dragon bone into powder and dust the body with it. Rub the face and entire body with both hands. Lie with the head to the east, knock the teeth nine times, close the eyes, clench the fists, and visualize layers of purple qi from the sunlight descending to envelop the body. Envision oneself within the radiance of the sun, the sun’s light revolving around the body, ascending to the Hall of Vast Spirit within the Eastern Well, beneath the towering ringed trees. Visualize the Cinnabar Spirit of Lesser Yang, the Perfected One named Gou Shangzhen, nine inches in height, clad in a flying robe of azure feathers, crowned with a diadem of luminous essence. From his mouth issues forth blue qi, which showers and nourishes the body.\n\nIn a vessel of lapis lazuli, request the jade spring’s azure mushroom ointment to bathe the body. Partake of the blossoms of the Three Qi, and as the flavor proves sweet and fragrant, the body grows warm all over. Then swallow qi nine times and cease, softly reciting the incantation:\n\nWithin the jade chamber of orchid halls,\nThe sun’s splendor soars on high.\nThe Three Blossoms knit their grace,\nWondrous light brushes the dawn.\nPrimal Simplicity returns to truth,\nGently irrigating the jade spring.\nThe form dwells in Vast Spirit,\nRainbow hues reflect the crimson portico.\nCavernous Yang exhales its essence,\nThe Eastern Well refines the soul.\nThe Five Thearchs’ crowns and sashes,\nTransform the countenance to golden visage,\nCheeks plump and bright,\nTo become a jade immortal.\nCinnabar Spirit of Lesser Yang,\nRender me thus by nature.\nGolden wings adorn and embellish,\nFeathered robes gleam at dawn.\nSuddenly ascending the void,\nTo sip at the root of the sun.\nThe body mirrors water’s clarity,\nThe dragon chariot’s light rejoices.\nFeathered carriages come to welcome,\nTo ascend before the Jade Thearch.\n\nWhen the incantation is complete, ingest the Ninefold Refined Dragon Radiance Talisman, swallow qi ninety times, and swallow saliva twenty-four times, then cease.\n\nFor all who practice this Way, when lying down at dusk, begin on the day of the Beginning of Autumn and continue until the Beginning of Winter. With both hands, grasp the shoulders thirty-two times each. Envision the sun within the well of the left shoulder and the moon within the well of the right shoulder, their two lights shining upon and enveloping the body. Knock the teeth twelve times and recite the incantation:\n\nSun to the left, moon to the right,\nThe two luminaries oversee the spirit.\nAt dusk, rest in Lesser Yang,\nAt dawn, ascend to Jade Purity.\nThe Three Hun guard the chamber,\nThe Seven Po stabilize the form.\nMyriad spirits assist and flank,\nTo join the luminaries in their course.\n\nWhen the incantation is complete, lie down.\n\nAfter practicing this for eight years, the entire body will radiate light, the face will emanate the essence of azure brilliance, and one will converse with Lesser Yang. Green carriages will descend, enabling flight through the dark void to ascend to Jade Purity.\n\nWithin the Palace of Vast Cold grows a forest of azure blossoms, towering four thousand *zhang* high. Its branches extend one thousand two hundred *li*, and its circumference spans two hundred forty *li*. Its leaves resemble bamboo but are crimson, its flowers resemble mirrors but are luminous, and its fruit resembles plums but bears no pit—this is the famed Crimson Tree with Cinnabar Fruit.\n\nThose who eat its leaves gain longevity of ten thousand years. Those who eat its flowers share the numinosity of the sun. Those who eat its fruit feast and wander in Jade Purity.\n\nAbove, golden-winged ravens spread their wings to encircle the realm. Below lies the Pool of Vast Cold, where the naturally occurring Ninefold Refined Vast Spring flows, five myriad *li* deep and five thousand *li* in breadth.\n\nThe Supreme Thearchs and lofty immortals, the Perfected Ones, all ascend to the Palace of Vast Cold on the day of the Beginning of Winter to pluck the azure blossoms for their adornment. They approach the Pool of Vast Cold to bathe in the Vast Spring and refine their truth.\n\nAll advanced scholars of the Dao who have attained completion, as well as the seven generations of ancestors of scholars who are to ascend to the celestial halls, must pass through the Palace of Vast Cold, enter the Ninefold Refined Spring, undergo refinement, and then ascend to heaven.\n\nAfter completing the refinement, they partake of the blossoms and fruit of the azure forest. The golden-winged ravens weave their feathers into flying immortal garments, bestowed upon those who have undergone refinement, to ascend to the Upper Palace of Jade Purity.\n\nAll advanced scholars of the Dao who ingest the Way of the Sun and Moon should, on the night of the Beginning of Winter at midnight, take three *ge* of mica, and inscribe in black ink the Yin Talisman of the Sun’s Essence Refined Essence on azure paper. Combine and cast them into clear water, bathe facing north, stand before the vessel, knock the teeth twelve times, and softly recite the incantation as in the text for the Beginning of Spring.\n\nWhen finished, draw in qi and swallow it nine times, then cease. Return to the chamber and burn incense. Grind mica into powder and dust the body with it. Rub the face and entire body with both hands. Lie with the head to the north, knock the teeth nine times, close the eyes, clench the fists, and visualize layers of purple qi from the sunlight descending to envelop the body in crimson. Envision oneself within the radiance of the sun, the sun’s light revolving around the body, ascending to the Palace of Vast Cold within the forest of azure blossoms, to the Pool of the Ninefold Refined Vast Spring. Visualize the Perfected One of Jade Radiance of the Yin Spirit, named Xuan Shangming, five inches and three *fen* in height, clad in a brocade robe of dark void, crowned with a diadem of luminous Yang jade. From his mouth issues forth a cloud of dark qi, which showers and nourishes the body.\n\nIn a golden tray, request the Ninefold Refined Vast Spring to bathe the body, and receive the fruit of the azure blossoms. Upon eating, the flavor is sweet, and the body grows warm all over. Then swallow qi fifty times and cease, softly reciting the incantation:\n\nThe Nine Luminaries generate radiance,\nTheir effulgence shines upon the dark pivot.\nVast rosy clouds rise in splendor,\nThe Cold Palace stretches afar.\nThe Four Elders’ upper abode,\nWhere the August Emperor roams.\nThe wheel of bright jade,\nFive winds hasten the frame.\nNurtured in the land of cold,\nRefining hardness and softness to freshness.\nThe Eight Qi interact,\nThe Four Directions intertwine.\nCrown and sash now arrayed,\nThe sun’s essence exhales its talisman.\nCrimson Tree with red fruit,\nTo share heaven’s repose.\nGolden wings brush the feathers,\nEmbroidered robes gleam without end.\nDispersing mist and falling light,\nTo reach the Western Peak.\nGolden gates and orchid chambers,\nThe Four Qi mutually sustain.\nDark Perfection holds the covenant,\nJade Radiance roams as one.\n\nWhen the incantation is complete, ingest the Yin Talisman of the Sun’s Essence Refined Essence, swallow qi fifty times, and swallow saliva twenty times, then cease.\n\nFor those who practice this Way, when lying down at dusk, begin on the day of the Beginning of Winter and continue until the Beginning of Spring. With both hands, rub from below the navel to the Gate of Life fifty times each. Envision the sun below the navel and the moon within the Gate of Life, their two lights blending into a yellow hue, illuminating the entire body. Knock the teeth nine times and recite the incantation:\n\nAt dawn, drink from the Orchid Pool; at dusk, lodge in the Golden Chamber. Sun and moon intertwine their girdles, the Dark Shade shelters the Purple Void. The hun-soul is at peace, the po-soul is serene; the ten thousand spirits guard their abodes. The Four Perfected hold the covenant, descending in cloud-borne chariots to ascend the Golden Gates, their names inscribed in the Emperor’s register.\n\nWhen the incantation is complete, lie down. Practicing this Way for eight years, the body emits wondrous radiance, a circular halo crowns the neck, illuminating the eight directions. Riding clouds, one soars aloft and ascends to heaven in broad daylight.\n\nOn this day, one receives refinement at the Golden Gate, is crowned and girdled in the Cavern of Yang, bathes in the Eastern Well, and is nurtured in the Vast Cold. Circulating through the four quarters for one hundred and eighty days, one returns above the Golden Gate.\n\nThe celestial reckoning speaks of three thousand six hundred cycles: when yang qi is obstructed and yin qi surges, the convergence of the Hundred and Six brings myriad calamities to the world, and heaven’s divisions alter their measures. The adept must follow the day’s movement, gathering yang essence to evade the Hundred and Six’s disasters.\n\nThe moon spans one thousand nine hundred *li* in breadth; its halo encircles seven thousand eight hundred and forty *li*. Within, white silver, lapis lazuli, and crystal water reflect, their one part divided into sixty, their blazing light shining without. Within it lie cities and people, as well as seven-jeweled bathing pools and forests of eight *qian* trees. The moon’s inhabitants stand one *zhang* and six *chi* tall, all clad in garments of azure hue.\n\nFrom the first to the sixteenth day of the lunar month, the moon’s people gather white silver and lapis lazuli, refining them in the forge of blazing light—thus the moon waxes, its radiance bright. From the seventeenth to the twenty-ninth day, within the *qian* forests, they gather the blossoms of the Three Qi, brushing away the light of sun and moon—thus the moon wanes, its light dim.\n\nThe Dark Radiance’s movement is governed by the Five Winds, which weave its warp. Thus it regulates the sun, moon, and starry lodges, coursing through the Void without cease.\n\nOn the Autumnal Equinox, when the moon lodges above the Eastern Well, in the Hall of Vast Numinosity, one bathes in the Eastern Well’s pool to refine the moon’s hun-soul and brighten the Eightfold Clarity’s rays. On this day, the moon receives yang essence from the sun’s brilliance, exhaling yellow qi into the Jade Pool. On the Autumnal Equinox, the hosts of heaven gather the flowers of the Ring Tree to brush the light of sun and moon, and the moon pours yellow qi to anoint the countenances of heaven’s people. Thus the Autumnal Equinox is the day of heaven’s grand assembly, the time when yellow qi and yang essence intermingle and descend.\n\nFor those who seek the Dao of immortality, on the Autumnal Equinox at dawn, enter the chamber, face west, and recline or sit as desired. Close the eyes and inwardly envision the White Radiance Lady of the Moon, whose surname is [omitted] and given name [omitted]. She stands six *cun* and six *fen* tall, her hair bound in a cloud-like topknot, clad in a soaring skirt of plain brocade. Her mouth holds moonlight, which descends into the adept’s body, settling within the Gate of Life.\n\nAfter a moment, the moonlight scatters into yellow qi, enveloping the entire body. The White Radiance Lady stands within the full moon, gathering the flowers of the Ring Tree and scattering them amid the yellow qi. From her mouth, she exhales yang essence—crimson in hue—which pours into the adept’s form, from within to without. Yellow and crimson qi intertwine, suffusing the entire body.\n\nThe Lady bestows upon the adept six red characters in purple script. Then draw in yellow qi thirty-six times and yang essence twenty-four times, then cease. Knock the teeth twenty-four times and recite the prayer with upturned face:\n\n*\"Azure Pool, numinous abyss,\nFlying springs exhale fragrance.\nEssence pours into cinnabar radiance,\nScattering blossoms in the numinous hall.\nYang descends as jade mushrooms,\nYin qi blends with yellow.\nThe Two Radiant Ones conceal their glow,\nThe Three Ways follow their course.\nThe Lady is crowned and girdled,\nBathed in blazing light.\nWith her saliva she anoints the body,\nOrchid’s moisture overflows.\nRed script in purple characters\nMirrors the Six Palaces.\nWithin, the Golden Immortal is transformed;\nWithout, flying dragons descend.\nJade chariots and feathered canopies,\nDark canopies soar on high.\nCloud-borne steeds come to welcome,\nFour convergences, eight connections.\nThe Seven Luminaries and Purple Radiance\nSoar through the Great Void.\"*\n\nWhen the incantation is complete, swallow qi thirty-six times and saliva twenty-four times, then cease. Ingest the purple-script red characters.\n\nPracticing this Way for eight years, the Lady manifests in form, speaking with the adept. The entire body emits purple and azure light, traversing the Dark Void, and the immortal ascends to heaven.\n\nThe above are the hidden sounds of the moon’s hun-soul in red characters of purple script, inscribed upon the leaves of the *qian* trees in the moon’s eastern precincts—a script of natural formation. Those who ingest these characters attain longevity of ten thousand years.\n\nThough there are dozens of methods for practicing the Way of the Sun and Moon, these sounds are no longer transmitted. To recklessly divulge them invites the punishment of wind and blade in this life, while seven generations of ancestors are consigned to the boundless hells of ghostly retribution, suffering the Three Paths and Five Torments for ten thousand kalpas without release.\n\nOn the Autumnal Equinox at dawn, face east, inscribe the purple script in cinnabar upon paper, ingest it, knock the teeth twelve times, and softly recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Dark Radiance, bright and clear,\nPurple qi, resplendent light.\nRising swiftly with the sun,\nFour and six in harmony.\nWithout, brushing crimson blossoms;\nWithin, knitting the Eight Rays.\nPurple Dao flows in brilliance,\nMy body at ease and full.\nRiding the radiant chariot,\nI ascend to the Emperor’s hall.\"*\n\nWhen the incantation is complete, swallow qi twenty-four times, then cease. Again, inscribe the red characters upon purple paper and wear them at the crown of the head for three years. A purple radiance three *chi* in length will crown the head, and six Jade Maidens will attend, imparting numinous sounds. To recklessly inform three others is to die and become a ghostly official.\n\nOnly those whose names are inscribed in gold and whose characters are written in jade may transmit this to one person in a hundred years. Guard it in secrecy, and one becomes an immortal, soaring through the Upper Clarity.\n\nOn the Winter Solstice, the moon retreats to the Palace of Vast Cold. The Palace of Vast Cold is the moon’s upper abode, where at this time the moon’s hun-soul is nurtured in its pools. On this day, one receives yellow qi into the Jade Womb and exhales yang essence into the Cold Pool. The hosts of heaven, on this day, gather the blossoms of the Azure Forest to brush the light of sun and moon, and the moon pours yang essence to anoint the countenances of heaven’s people. Thus the Winter Solstice is the time when the Way’s movement treads the long path, the moment when yellow qi and yang essence receive radiance.\n\nFor those who seek the Dao of immortality, on the Winter Solstice at noon, enter the chamber, face north, and recline or sit as desired. Close the eyes and inwardly envision the Dark Radiance Lady of the Moon, whose surname is [omitted] and given name [omitted]. She stands five *cun* and five *fen* tall, her hair bound in a cloud-like topknot, clad in a soaring skirt of dark brocade. Her mouth holds moonlight, which descends into the adept’s heart.\n\nAfter a moment, the moonlight scatters into yellow qi, suffusing the adept’s body. The Lady stands within the full moon, gathering blossoms from the Azure Forest and scattering them amid the yellow qi. From her mouth she exhales yang essence—red in color—which envelops the adept’s form, weaving inward to outward. The yellow and red qi intertwine, illuminating the entire body.\n\nThe Lady bestows upon the adept six purple-script cinnabar characters in secret tones. Then she guides the adept to swallow yellow qi thirty-two times and yang essence twenty-four times, then to knock the teeth twenty-four times. Looking upward, the adept recites the incantation:\n\nDark Yin Cold Pool, flowing springs in vast courtyards,\nFlying blossoms scatter radiance, exhaling yellow and inhaling essence.\nThe two qi entwine, jade mushrooms sprout in emptiness,\nHeavenly beings sip fragrance, the Lady lends her numinous wings.\nOrchid pools surge, flowing yellow veils the dark,\nThroughout the heavens, absorb radiance, descend upon my form.\nRestore youth, refine countenance, reverse white to bind green,\nPurple script of the Eastern Palace, cinnabar writings link names.\nWinged steeds and feathered canopies, four perfected ones guard the chariot,\nBear me aloft together, ascend to Jade Clarity.\n\nWhen the incantation is complete, the adept swallows qi thirty times and saliva twenty-four times, then ingests the purple-script cinnabar characters.\n\nPracticing this Way for eight years, the Lady bestows upon the adept the Bright Moon Pendants and the cinnabar-script Dao, enabling flight through the mysterious void and ascent to Jade Clarity.\n\nThe above purple-script cinnabar characters and hidden tones of the Moon Soul are all inscribed in the Azure Forest of the moon’s northern realm, forming natural script.\n\nAugust Supreme Perfected Ones and all heavenly beings, on the Winter Solstice, gather and ingest these purple-script cinnabar characters.\n\nThose who ingest these six characters will have boundless luminous radiance suffuse their bodies, sharing the same lifespan as the heavenly beings.\n\nThis method is most solemn; it is a secret of the Celestial Lord. To recklessly divulge these numinous tones invites the trial of wind blades upon one’s body, while seven generations of ancestors will be consigned to the endless torments of ghostly servitude, enduring the three paths and five sufferings for ten thousand kalpas without reprieve.\n\nOn the Winter Solstice at noon, face north and inscribe the characters in ink upon green paper, then ingest them. Knock the teeth twelve times and softly recite the incantation:\n\nSupporting dawn, bathing in radiance’s net,\nCircular light flourishes in Jade Clarity.\nMysterious brilliance crowns the brocade union,\nGreat Desert mirrors the cinnabar numen.\nFragrant pearls govern hidden awakening,\nPurple script intersperses azure blossoms.\nAugust Supreme illuminates the Dao’s branches,\nMist and splendor pervade the empty brightness.\nWash me in the Yellow Qi Pool,\nRinse me with the Great Yang Essence.\nAbove, brush the Radiant Forest’s midst,\nLooking up, sip the heavenly beings’ essence.\nSoaring through layered mysteries above,\nSun and moon share the same root’s glory.\n\nWhen the incantation is complete, swallow qi twenty-four times and stop.\n\nFurther, inscribe cinnabar script upon purple silk and wear it upon the head. Boundless luminous radiance will then suffuse the adept’s form, and six Jade Maidens will be granted to guard the adept’s body, along with six Jade Lads to protect the adept’s person.\n\nTo recklessly speak of these numinous tones and reveal them to three others is to be consigned to ghostly officials in death, never again to attain immortality.\n\nWithin a hundred years, if one encounters the *Golden Name Imperial Chart*, the *Green Script of Purple Clarity*, it may be transmitted to a single person. Secretly mastering it, one becomes a divine immortal, flying through the great void.\n\nOn the Spring Equinox, when the moon lodges above the Golden Gate, there lies the Gate of Communion with the Numinous. At that time, the moon refines within the Golden Essence Smelting Pool, tempered by the Stone Radiance Water Mother and adorned by the Flower Light.\n\nOn this day, yang essence is poured into the Golden Gate, and yellow qi is received into the Jade Spring. August Supreme Perfected Ones and all heavenly beings gather on this day to pluck blossoms from the *Qian* trees, brushing the light of sun and moon. The moon pours yellow qi to anoint the countenances of heaven’s people. Thus the Spring Equinox is the time when the myriad qi intermingle in harmony, when divine radiance coalesces, and when yellow qi and yang essence descend to meet.\n\nFor those who seek the Dao of immortality, on the Spring Equinox at dusk, enter the chamber, face west, and recline or sit as desired. Close the eyes and inwardly envision the Azure Radiance Lady of the Moon, whose surname is [omitted] and given name [omitted]. She stands nine *cun* tall, her hair bound in a cloud-like topknot, clad in a soaring skirt of azure brocade. Her mouth holds moonlight, which descends upon the adept’s two eyes.\n\nAfter a moment, the moonlight scatters into yellow qi, suffusing the entire form. The Lady stands at the moon’s center, gathering blossoms from the *Qian* Forest and scattering them amid the yellow qi. From her mouth she exhales yang essence—red in color—which pours over the adept’s form, weaving inward to outward. The yellow and red qi intertwine, suffusing the entire body.\n\nThe Lady bestows upon the adept six purple-script cinnabar characters in secret tones. Then she guides the adept to swallow yellow qi twenty-four times and yang essence sixteen times, then to knock the teeth twenty-four times. Looking upward, the adept recites the incantation:\n\nEightfold smelting of the Golden Crucible,\nCinnabar Pool’s vast abyss,\nJade nectar surges,\nFlowing to scatter the eight *Qian*.\nYellow qi rises in dense clouds,\nYang essence congeals as mist.\nGathering blossoms in the Orchid Court,\nFlying skirts flutter in profusion.\nThe Lady sips fragrance,\nAugust Supreme pours divine fluid.\nGentle radiance melts in season,\nMoistening all heavens.\nCinnabar brilliance shines in eight directions,\nLuminous clarity pervades.\nReflected glory curves and gleams,\nDescending upon my body.\nAttaining union with the Moon Soul,\nPreserving numinous years forever,\nRiding the void, steering the floating,\nAscending to the boundless.\n\nWhen the incantation is complete, the adept swallows qi twenty-four times and saliva sixteen times, then ingests the purple-script cinnabar characters.\n\nPracticing this Way for eight years, the Lady bestows upon the adept the true tones of the cinnabar script. Moon blossoms scatter to brush the adept’s body, and the face assumes a golden countenance, enabling flight to the Upper Clarity.\n\nThe above purple-script cinnabar characters and hidden tones of the Moon Soul are all inscribed in the *Qian* Forest of the moon’s western realm, forming natural script.\n\nAugust Supreme Perfected Ones and all heavenly beings, on the Spring Equinox, gather and ingest these purple-script cinnabar characters.\n\nThose who ingest these six characters will have flaming radiance suffuse their bodies, and the seven treasures of the moon’s jade pendants will become clearly visible.\n\nThis method is most secret; the August Supreme inscribes these tones within the Jade Chapters of the August Supreme, thus forming the Dragon Script of the Highest. To recklessly divulge these numinous tones is to consign seven generations of ancestors to punishment, to be bound in servitude to ghostly officials, to suffer the trial of wind blades, and never to attain immortality.\n\nOn the Spring Equinox at the *bu* hour, write in white on yellow paper and ingest it. Strike the teeth twelve times and softly recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Great radiance illumines the central heavens,\nBright rosy clouds adorn the golden chamber.\nJade characters array auspicious clouds,\nCinnabar script forms clustered groves.\nFlying songs scatter through the vermilion forest,\nIn the profound vastness of the Great Desert,\nNuminous tones sing of themselves,\nSubtle words of the Eight Pure Palaces.\nAll heavens inhale golden fragrance,\nFlowing essences bathe my countenance.\nSpirit conjoins with the virtue of heaven and humanity,\nThe August Supreme descends with the Purple Youth,\nConveying me to soar through the Nine Voids,\nAscending to the Vermilion Moon Palace.\"*\n\nWhen the incantation is complete, swallow qi twenty-four times. Then write in cinnabar above the purple script and wear it at the crown of the head. After three years, natural purple radiance will suffuse one’s form, and six Jade Maidens will be granted.\n\nTo recklessly divulge these numinous tones to three persons is to consign oneself to death at the hands of ghostly officials, to bind seven generations of ancestors in servitude, and to remain unredeemed for ten thousand kalpas.\n\nWithin a hundred years, if a Perfected One deigns to transmit this once, it is sufficient to attain divine transcendence and soar through the Highest Clarity.\n\n---\n\nOn the Summer Solstice, the moon resides in the Cavern Yang Palace. The Cavern Yang Palace is the moon’s upper abode; at this time, the moon refines itself in the Flowing Fire Courtyard, smelting within the Eight Rays and growing resplendent in the Moon Soul.\n\nOn this day, infuse yellow qi into the Cavern Yang, and absorb yang essence into the Fire Palace. The Eight Pure Perfected Ones and all heavenly beings, on this day, gather from the Azure Void Forest to brush away the brilliance of the sun and moon. The moon, with yang essence, bathes the countenances of the heavenly beings.\n\nThus, on the Summer Solstice, when luminous qi excites yang essence, descending yin and absorbing the numinous, it is the moment when the Two Luminaries conjoin their radiance.\n\nFor those who seek the Dao of immortality: on the Summer Solstice at midnight, enter a chamber facing south, recline or sit as desired, close the eyes, and inwardly visualize the Cinnabar Radiance Lady of the Moon, whose surname is □ and given name □. Her form is eight inches and eight fen tall, her hair bound in a cascading cloud chignon, clad in a vermilion brocade flying skirt. She holds moonbeams in her mouth, descending into the Crimson Palace within one’s body.\n\nPresently, the moonlight scatters into yellow qi. With each descent of a form, the Lady stands at the moon’s center, gathering azure void blossoms and scattering them amid the yellow qi. She exhales yang essence—yang essence is red—and bathes one’s form, from within to without. Yellow and red qi intertwine, illuminating the entire body.\n\nThe Lady bestows the six cinnabar characters of the purple script upon one’s body, then draws in yellow qi, swallowing it twenty-four times, and draws in yang essence twelve times before stopping. Strike the teeth twenty-four times and recite the incantation while looking upward:\n\n*\"Flowing Fire spans ten thousand leagues,\nEssence of the Cavern Yang,\nAbode of Yang’s Peace,\nTriple Flower Jade City.\nGolden immortals shine within,\nEight Pure and Fourfold Clarity,\nNine Luminaries descend their qi,\nPrimal Highest Numinous Ones.\nThe Lady inhales fragrance,\nScatters flowers in Jade Clarity.\nCinnabar script in purple characters,\nVoices conjoined with the Azure Void.\nOrchid pools and jade smoothness,\nFlowing through the Eight Darknesses.\nVermilion radiance veils all,\nHeavenly immortals grow resplendent.\nRevolving dawn’s curved brilliance,\nIlluminates and oversees my form.\nTo share life and death with the Vermilion Moon,\nRiding the void, driving the flying chariot,\nJade Maidens flank my position,\nGolden Lads assist my spirit.\nKingfisher plumes light the canopy,\nAscending to the Imperial Court.\"*\n\nWhen the incantation is complete, swallow qi twenty-four times and saliva twenty times before stopping, then ingest the cinnabar characters of the purple script.\n\nPracticing this Dao for eight years, the Lady will bestow upon one the true script of the cinnabar script, the moon’s jade pendants, enabling one to ascend and soar to the Cavern Yang Palace.\n\n---\n\nThe cinnabar characters of the Moon Soul’s hidden tones are all inscribed in the Azure Void Forest of the moon’s southern realm, forming natural script. The Eight Pure Perfected Ones and all heavenly beings, on the Summer Solstice, gather and ingest these cinnabar characters of the purple script.\n\nThose who ingest these six characters will share the same age as the Eight Pure, their nape bearing a circular luminosity that illumines the ten directions.\n\nThis method is most secret; the August Supreme Eight Pure Perfected Ones inscribe these tones within the Jade Chapters of the Eight Pure, thus forming the wondrous scripture of the Highest. To recklessly divulge these numinous tones is to consign seven generations of ancestors to punishment, to be cast into the Mountain of Knives, to suffer the trial of wind blades, and never to attain immortality.\n\n---\n\nOn the Summer Solstice at midnight, write in vermilion on white paper and ingest it. Strike the teeth twelve times and softly recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Yang essence in the cinnabar pool,\nFlowing Fire and swirling winds,\nGolden chariots wing the void,\nMysterious radiance brushes the heavens.\nEight Pure gather orchids,\nScatter fragrance in the Jade Court.\nAzure forests hang willows,\nWind stirs the jade branches.\nCinnabar script in purple characters,\nHolding elegance and flourishing splendor.\nFlowing fragrance bathes the essences,\nUniversally moistening without bound.\nTo share the mysterious radiance,\nEqual in brilliance to the Purple Empyrean.\"*\n\nWhen the incantation is complete, swallow qi twenty-four times, then write in cinnabar above the purple script and wear it at the crown of the head. After three years, the radiance of the sun and moon will illuminate one’s form, and the Moon Radiance Lady will bestow the true script, granting six Jade Maidens.\n\nTo recklessly transmit this to the unworthy is to consign seven generations of ancestors to punishment, never to be redeemed for ten thousand kalpas.\n\nSecretly cultivating for eight years, cloud chariots will descend, and one will ascend to heaven in broad daylight, soaring through Jade Clarity.\n\n---\n\nThe moon’s course circulates through the four quarters, thus it has phases of conjunction and opposition with the sun. The sun’s path is yang, the moon’s path is yin; though they revolve together, in their adornments, each resides in the four seasons.\n\nThus, the sun divides one hundred eighty days of yang, the moon divides one hundred eighty days of yin. Their cycles traverse three thousand six hundred degrees, and when they conjoin, yang qi excites while yin qi stagnates. When the Great Yang’s ninefold cycle completes its revolution, heaven and earth alter their lodgings, myriad plagues disperse, and evil and misfortune are eradicated.\n\nScholars who do not comprehend the revolutions of heaven and earth cannot escape the calamities of the Nine Yangs. Among those who accumulate learning, few attain the dragon chariot and ascend to the cloud towers. In vain do they labor in mountain caves, abstain from grains, swallow saliva, and ingest the essences of the sun and moon, yet remain ignorant of the divisions of the mysterious radiance—the vastness and narrowness of the celestial walled cities, the Seven Treasures and Vermilion Forests, the revolutions of the lodgings through the four quarters, the phases of waxing and waning.\n\nThe flying roots cannot be plucked, the imperial blossoms cannot be gathered. Yang essence will not descend, yin essence will not illumine. The Dao of the sun and moon remains distant indeed.\n\nIf one diligently seeks its root and comprehends the revolutions of the radiant degrees—knowing the celestial walled cities and earthly ruins, the Vermilion Forests and abyssal pools, the names and surnames of the Lady of the Moon—then the sun and moon will respond and descend, sparing one the arduous toil of distant seeking. Naturally, one may ride the cloud chariot and flying wheels to ascend to the gates of the sun and moon.\n\nThe purple script and cinnabar characters are bound within the spontaneous qi of the Eight Purities. The lofty and mysterious feathered chapters give life to the Eight Auspicious Forests of the moon, their characters suffused with purple radiance, gleaming brighter than the moon’s own light. The Eight Perfected of the Eight Purities and all the heavens gather the purple script and cinnabar characters from the Eight Auspicious Forests to ingest them, scattering incense to brush the light of the sun and moon. These sounds all express the *Great Cavern Perfected Scripture*, hence they are called the \"exalted texts.\" Those who ingest these characters will bear a golden countenance, their necks crowned with circular luminosity; the sun and moon will illumine them through and through, and they shall ascend as immortals without study. This method is most solemn, a secret of the exalted ones, not to be lightly disclosed. According to the precepts, within seven hundred years, if one bears the golden name of Eastern Florescence and the purple characters of Supreme Purity, a person of true harmony, they may receive its threefold transmission. Without such destiny, it must be sealed within the Jade Gate, never to be revealed for ten thousand kalpas.\n\n---\n\n**Eightfold Refinement: Alchemical Transmutation of the Perfected Talisman**\nOn the day of the Beginning of Spring, inscribe in yellow upon blue paper and cast into water for bathing. The entire body will be refined and transformed, summoning the mysterious radiance of the sun and moon and descending the Perfected into the Jade Court. Also, inscribe in yellow upon blue silk and wear it on the body for eight years to converse with the Perfected, who will descend with cloud chariots, ascending above the Golden Gate to receive refinement in the Alchemical Pool.\n\n---\n\n**Eightfold Refinement: Elixir Embryo Jade Talisman**\nAt noon on the day of the Beginning of Summer, inscribe in cinnabar upon yellow paper and cast into water for bathing. Both inner and outer will be refined and transformed, summoning the flying roots from the yang essence and drawing forth yellow qi from the Yellow Blossoms, turning the sun and moon to mysterious illumination and evoking the Perfected within the Jade Characters. Also, inscribe in cinnabar upon yellow silk and wear it on the body for eight years; the Perfected will descend to bestow the true script upon the aspirant, who shall ascend through the void to the Cavern Yang Palace.\n\n---\n\n**Ninefold Refinement of the Dragon Radiance Talisman**\nAt the hour of *bu* on the day of the Beginning of Autumn, inscribe in blue upon white paper and cast into water for bathing. The bones and marrow will be refined and transformed, summoning the mysterious radiance from the Purple Radiance, drawing the yang essence to the flying roots, and gathering the yellow qi into the Water Mother, descending the Perfected into the Purple Pavilion. Also, inscribe in blue upon white silk and wear it on the body for eight years; one’s head will bear the circular luminosity of the sun, enabling flight through the Grand Palace to ascend to the Hall of Vast Numinosity.\n\n---\n\n**Sun Soul: Refinement of Yin Essence Talisman**\nAt midnight on the day of the Beginning of Winter, inscribe in ink upon blue paper and cast into water for bathing. The blood and essence of the entire body will be refined and transformed, drawing the solar essence into the Purple Radiance, descending flying blossoms upon the Eight Auspicious Forests, refining the Five Palaces in the Jade Pool, and transporting the aspirant’s body to the Palace of Vast Cold. Also, inscribe in ink upon blue silk and wear it on the body for eight years; the body will emit golden light, the neck crowned with circular luminosity, and the Perfected will descend to bestow the true script, enabling flight through the Grand Void to ascend to the Palace of Vast Cold.\n\nThe Seven Stars lie four hundred thousand *li* from the earth, encircling seven hundred and twenty *li*, their walled cities forged of golden essence and lapis lazuli. The Seven Luminaries cast their purple radiance, illuminating their interiors—palaces where the hosts of heavenly beings and Perfected roam. The Palace of Vast Cold is their canopy. In one day and night, they complete a single revolution around the heavens, just as the wheels of the sun and moon. Within them grow Seven Treasures and Vermilion Forests. When, after settling into meditation, the initial breath of life arises, the Seven Stars receive refinement in the Palace of Vast Cold, their purple radiance gleaming brightly amidst the luminaries’ glow. At this time, the Seven Luminaries blaze and scatter, their essence streaming across the heavens, while the purple radiance emits its nectar to irrigate all the heavens. Thus, all the Perfected and Divine Immortals, without exception, gather the radiance of the Seven Luminaries and the orchids of the purple radiance.\n\nFor scholars who ingest the Dao of the sun and moon, they must cultivate the wondrous methods of the Seven Luminaries. After settling into meditation, retire to a separate chamber, burn incense, lie with the head to the north, compose the body and stabilize the spirit, abandoning all stray thoughts. Focus the mind upon the numinous, knock the teeth twenty-four times, and visualize the Seven Stars blazing brightly in the north. Envision oneself lying beneath the canopy of the Dipper amidst the Seven Stars, the light of the Seven Luminaries streaming beyond the purple radiance, crowning one’s body. One’s body rests above the purple radiance and within the Seven Luminaries, all within and without shrouded in darkness, nothing visible. After a long while, the light of the Seven Luminaries parts, transforming into seven youths, each upon a star.\n\nThe first youth is named *Shuming*, the second *Yaoling*, the third *Beiyuan*, the fourth *Baojing*, the fifth *Danying*, the sixth *Xuqing*, and the seventh *Ziying*. The seven youths emit the light of the Seven Treasures to nourish one’s body. *Shuming* emits the light of the purple radiance, *Yueling* the light of golden essence, *Beiyuan* the light of lapis lazuli, *Baojing* the light of white silver, *Danying* the light of jade essence, *Xuqing* the light of precious pearls, and *Ziying* the light of coral. The light of the Seven Treasures enters one’s body together. Then, draw in the breath forty-nine times and softly recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Golden essence congeals and transforms,\nBinding the seven numinous spirits.\nPurple luminaries blaze and scatter,\nVermilion radiance illumines through.\nCanopy sways, wheels turn in the cold court,\nTreasure light gleams, seven youths leap and dance.\nMysterious radiance emits orchids,\nFragrant mushrooms overflow.\nAt dusk, repose in the numinous hall;\nAt dawn, ascend to Jade Purity.\nThe jade pivot turns the path,\nPurple radiance wings the form.\nFeast and rein the cloud wheels,\nWhip and drive the flying chariot.\nGaze upon the eight poles,\nThree paths converge as one.\"*\n\nAfter reciting, swallow saliva seven times and cease. Rise and dust the body with powdered millet, then lie down fully covered.\n\nAfter seven years of such practice, the body will radiate the light of the seven treasures, and a canopy of purple radiance will perpetually crown one’s form. Then, seven jade lads will be dispatched to govern the flying cloud chariot, arriving to welcome the adept’s body and ascend to the Northern Asterism. This Dao is arcane and wondrous, cultivated only by the highest perfected; it is not transmitted to the lower world. Those who inscribe their mystical names before birth and record them in the Azure Register and Jade Scriptures shall attain this Dao. Those who succeed will become perfected transcendents, masters and patriarchs of the ten thousand immortals.\n\nTo recklessly disclose it brings blindness, mutilation, and punishment; one’s seven ancestors will be consigned to the Knife Mountain and Fire Torment, suffering through the Three Wretched Realms for ten thousand kalpas without deliverance. Scholars must be prudent and reverent, for this is the profound decree of the Four Poles—cherish it deeply.\n\nThese seven lads are the refined essences of the seven treasures, transformed into the highest perfected of the seven luminaries. To know their names is to escape death; to cultivate their method is to attain immortality. To reveal their taboo names is to invite blindness. By recalling them morning and evening, they will perpetually guard the adept’s body. Should misfortune, peril, or distress arise, strike the teeth seven times and invoke the names of the seven lads—the calamity will dissolve of itself.\n\nThis Dao must be known in solitude alone; how could one cast pearls and jade amidst filth and dust? Be prudent and guard its secrecy.\n\nThe Supreme One commanded the Four Directors, the Five Emperors, and the various Heavenly Kings to dispatch the Inspectors of Perfected Immortals, who perpetually traverse the Five Marchmounts and all renowned mountains. In the world, there are the essentials of the Three Ways—the method of the Yellow Qi and Yang Essence, and the scriptures of cinnabar writing in purple characters. Those who possess these are listed in the Eastern Flower, their names memorialized in the Golden Portal, and seven jade lads and seven jade maidens each attend the body of those who hold the scriptures.\n\nShould one lightly divulge the numinous sounds or neglect the precious texts, the jade lads will report this, and the Five Emperors’ divine soldiers will punish them, condemning them to death and servitude amidst the Three Paths and Five Sufferings. Their seven generations of ancestors will bear the blame, and for ten thousand kalpas, there shall be no deliverance. Those who cultivate the essentials of the Three Ways must, on the third, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days of the lunar month—three days each month—face the light of the sun and moon. At midnight, they pay homage to the essence of the Seven Stars, bowing twice and concentrating their minds, aspiring to ascend to the radiance of the Three Luminaries and partake of the divine splendor of their countenances. After seven years of such practice, the sun and moon will respond and descend, bestowing upon them the Dao of the Divine Perfected.\n\nIf one’s name is inscribed in gold and jade and recorded in the Mysterious Chart, and one is deemed worthy of receiving this scripture, the master must observe the covenant with a fast of ninety days, or twenty-seven days, or three days. The disciple shall present seven taels of gold, forty feet of yellow silk, and thirty-two feet of blue silk, and the transmission shall proceed after the oath is sworn. Without the covenant, to lightly divulge it will subject the master to interrogation and the forfeiture of their body, while the disciple, for glimpsing the celestial perfected, will violate the covenant and suffer mutilation. Their seven generations of ancestors will incur guilt, and for three trials, there shall be no deliverance.\n\nThe celestial writings are wondrous and weighty; the cinnabar script in purple characters is most secret. Thus, it is treasured with covenantal faith and must not be lightly transmitted. Scholars who suffer this interrogation must be prudent and reverent. This numinous scripture was born within the Great Void, inscribed upon the Dark Garden above, in the shade of the Piled Stones, within the golden halls and jade chambers. The numinous text shines brilliantly, its purple characters soaring through the clouds, while three thousand divine lads and three thousand jade maidens, wielding incense, attend the divine perfected.\n\nThe Supreme Primordial Sovereign of the Southern Culmen received it from the Supreme One and cast the covenant into the Great Void, transmitting it to the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity. The Celestial Emperor transmitted it to the Queen Mother of the Western Tortoise, who passed it to the Emperor of the Golden Portal. The Emperor entrusted it to the Azure Lad of the Highest Minister, who was to transmit it to later scholars worthy of becoming perfected immortals. Now, one copy is sealed within the Western City Mountain.\n\nThose who study immortality but do not cultivate this Way labor in vain to summon the perfected. They may attain only lesser immortality and escape death, but to hope to unlock the Celestial Gate and ascend to the Golden Portal shall forever remain beyond their reach. Once one masters the Three Ways and practices the Eight Refinements, even if one does not achieve ascension in broad daylight, on the day of transformation, one will naturally ascend to the Golden Gate and the palaces of the Four Quarters. There, one shall undergo further refinement in the Jade Pool, receive the feathered raiment of golden wings, and ascend to the palace of the Golden Portal.\n\nThus, this method is lofty and wondrous, incomparable to ordinary scriptures. Those who obtain its text shall become immortals without even practicing it. The immortals Zhonghuang, Xuanzisheng, Mo Di, Zhao Yanfu, Ning Kangbo, Peng Jian, An Qi, and Bogao, along with seven hundred others, sought the Dao and endured hardships, their devotion reaching the Jade Void. Though they soared to the cliffs of the heavens and roamed the Five Marchmounts, they did not obtain the essentials of the Three Ways and thus could not ascend within the Golden Gate or receive the protocols of the Golden Portal. Now, they ride the winds through the empty clouds, serving as charioteers for the Jade Clarity and escorts for the highest perfected—how different is this from those who, in their early studies, toil in the lower realms yet aspire to wander the Cloudy Portal?\n\nIn contrast, Su Zilin, Gu Xizi, Youyang Jun, Wang Qiao, Chisong, Huangren, and Qingzhen, from the outset of their studies, cultivated the essentials of the Three Ways—the method of the Yellow Qi and Yang Essence, and the cinnabar script in purple characters. Thus, they swiftly transcended the Three Clarities, ascended to the Palace of Azure Flower, and received the wondrous scriptures of the highest grade. They journeyed to the Golden Portal to receive their titles, attaining the rank of the highest perfected immortals of the Jade Clarity and the Four Poles. How different is this from those of mere aspiration?\n\nThe Perfected King transmitted this scripture to the Lady of the Southern Marchmount, and it is now sealed within the chamber of the Southern Grotto of the Yang Bathing Palace. Those with aspiration should diligently seek its text.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Yellow Qi, Yang Essence, and Three Ways in Sequential Practice* concludes.",

      "translated_text": "**The Upper Clarity Scripture of the Yellow Qi and the Three Yang Essence Circuits**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Upper Clarity Scripture of the Yellow Qi and the Three Yang Essence Circuits*, also known as *The Hidden Heaven and Concealed Moon*. Author unknown, approximately composed during the Eastern Jin dynasty. A foundational scripture of the early Shangqing tradition. One scroll. Base text from *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* section, *Benwen* category.\n\nThe Supreme Lord of the Southern Ultimate and Upper Primordial said: I have received the essentials of the Highest’s Three Circuits in Sequence, the Dao of the Yellow Qi and Yang Essence. By ingesting numinous radiance, sipping the imperial blossoms, and gazing upon the soaring roots, I store the Seven Luminaries within the Purple Effulgence, traverse the Three Paths at the Golden Gate, fathom the vast and narrow within the Abyssal Radiance, discern the square and round of the sun and moon, behold the Vermilion Stairs in the Cavernous Yang, enter to refine the intestines in the Broad Cold, ascend the Seven Treasures at the Dark Garden, climb the Flying Ladder at the Numinous Pass, return the Yang Essence to the Floating Black, gather the Yellow Qi from the Yüshāna, roam beside the Golden Wings on the Lofty Tree, and pass through the Stone Radiance to illumine the countenance. Through cultivating and mastering the numinous diagrams, I thus summoned the divine perfected ones. Thereupon, the Three Effulgences cast their light, the Seven Essences flanked my chariot, the Five Numinous Ones girded me with their sashes, the Four Directors composed their registers, the Western Tortoise fixed the records, and my name was inscribed in the Highest Dawn. Thus, I ascended to the rank of the Supreme Lord of the Southern Ultimate and Upper Primordial.\n\nThis Dao is lofty and wondrous, not something that mediocre men or narrow scholars may discuss. Now, I compile what I have received and roughly expound the Highest Jade Emperor’s arcane words to mark the mysterious and spontaneous numinous script, entrusting it to the Upper Minister, the Azure Lad, who oversees the records of the Mysterious Palace. After ten thousand kalpas, it shall be transmitted to those destined to receive the Mysterious Record on white slips and azure registers.\n\nSuch numinous scriptures and purple texts as the *Eightfold Simplicity Perfected Scripture*, the *Purple Clouds’ Inner Contemplation*, the *Sun’s Radiance within the Mysterious*, and others each speak of their respective practices, valuing only the ingestion and mastery of them, yet they cannot encompass their great root and origin, nor expand their vastness and dispersion. This may be called grasping the branches without fathoming the root, obtaining the Dao without attaining its source. Therefore, the study must be broadly pursued, requiring the mutual completion of above and below, the cultivation from beginning to end. When the Dao is complete and qi is abundant, there is none who shall not become immortal.\n\nThe sun’s breadth spans two thousand and forty *li*. Within it, golden essence and watery essence form halos, their flowing light illuminating the exterior. Within it are cities and people, seven-jeweled bathing pools, and four kinds of lotuses—blue-green, red, yellow, and white. The people are twenty-four feet tall, clad in vermilion robes, and they flourish and wither together with the four kinds of flowers. Thus, the four seasons—spring, autumn, winter, and summer—proceed therein.\n\nThe sun’s movement is governed by five winds: the Seasonal Wind, the Direct Wind, the Assisting Wind, the Revolving Door Wind, and the Traveling Wind. Therefore, the regulation and control of the sun, moon, and stars, their roaming through the void qi without cease, are all governed by the framework of these winds.\n\nThe waxing and waning of the sun and moon’s movements are all due to the convergence of the four seasons, the concealment and adornment of their crowns and sashes. Above the Golden Gate, the sun’s movement is unimpeded and luminous. Within the Golden Gate lies the pool of smelted golden essence, situated in the region of the Western Pass and Yéni. On the day of the Beginning of Spring, one receives the refinement of the hun-soul within the Golden Gate, its radiance shining without. At this time, the light and scene are gentle and fresh, the qi of all under heaven is warm, and this occurs once in the year, lasting forty-five days before ceasing. Each month, it naturally repeats five times, with a minor refinement of the Eight Rays above the Golden Gate, as the essentials are already detailed in the *Eightfold Simplicity Scripture*.\n\nProceeding in sequence to the Cavernous Yang Palace, the upper lodge of the sun, also called Líluó, situated in the region of the Floating Black. On the day of the Beginning of Summer, within the Cavernous Yang Palace, one exhales the essence of smelted gold to irrigate the palace, further refining the Eight Rays in the courtyard of flowing fire. At this time, the sunlight is dim yet intense, the yang qi overflows and scatters, and all under heaven is greatly hot. This occurs once in the year, lasting forty-five days before ceasing.\n\nProceeding in sequence to above the Eastern Well, the path through which the moon’s radiance communicates, situated in the region of Lù. On the day of the Beginning of Autumn, the sun bathes in the radiant halo within the Eastern Well, gathering the qi of the Eight Simplicities and returning to the Broad Cold Palace. At this time, the celestial scene is lofty and clear, the qi of all under heaven is cool, and this occurs once in the year, lasting forty-five days before ceasing.\n\nProceeding in sequence to the Broad Cold Palace, the upper lodge of the moon, the floral canopy of the Seven Stars, situated at the boundary of Yüshāna. On the day of the Beginning of Winter, the sun’s essence is concealed within the Broad Cold Palace, where it dons its crown and sash to nurture the embryo. At this time, the sunlight is yin, and all under heaven is cold. This occurs once in the year, lasting forty-five days before ceasing.\n\nIn one year, the sun’s movement completes its circuit, donning its crown and sash in the four directions, totaling one hundred and eighty days. These are the regions the sun traverses, while the remaining one hundred and eighty days belong to the moon’s movement. The two luminaries separate and unite, yin and yang wax and wane, each having its allotted measure and limit.\n\nWithin the Golden Gate stands the Lofty Soaring Tree, forty thousand *li* tall, its branches extending two thousand *li*, its girth two hundred and eighty *li*, and its roots plunging eight hundred and forty *li* deep. At its summit is [a figure] who ascends to heaven. The Jade Emperor, hearing of his valor and might, commanded him to guard the north, overseeing the position of Zhenwu, to sever the demonic and evil of the world.\n\nThe Perfected One addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: How may this divine general descend to the lower realm to subdue and eliminate demonic ghosts, deliver sentient beings, and spare them from violent deaths, thereby daily increasing their blessings? I humbly beseech the Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy to grant this request.\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy commanded the Jade Lad of the Right, who swiftly dispatched a true talisman directly to the north to summon the divine general Zhenwu. Upon receiving the summons, the general led his divine hosts directly before the Heavenly Worthy, kneeling and saying: Your servant has already received the Jade Emperor’s command to guard the north. Today, for what reason do I merit the sight of your compassionate countenance? I have been specially summoned by your talisman.",

You should proceed there to subdue and eliminate the demonic forces, delivering and rescuing the wandering souls.\n\nThe divine general Zhenwu, respectfully receiving the Heavenly Worthy’s command, loosened his hair and went barefoot, treading upon the coiling serpent and the Eight Trigrams divine tortoise. He led his host of three hundred thousand divine generals, the Six Ding and Six Jia spirits, the Five Thunder divine soldiers, mighty dragons, lions, venomous dragons, and fierce beasts—all in procession before and behind—arriving together in the lower realm. Within seven days, the demonic forces throughout the world were all subdued and eliminated, separating humans from ghosts, dispersing vengeful souls, securing the peace of the living, and bringing tranquility to the land. The divine general Zhenwu and his assembled hosts then returned to the Upper Prime Palace and presented themselves before the Heavenly Worthy, saying: Yesterday, in obedience to your command, I descended to the lower realm to subdue and slay the demonic forces. By the power of your compassionate virtue, within seven days, all the malevolent spirits throughout the world were swept away.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: Excellent! Have you and the other deities not wearied yourselves?\n\nThereupon, the divine general Zhenwu crossed the Qian trigram to deploy the Dipper, pointing the Big Dipper’s handle with fierce energy, aiding the Celestial Pass, and intoned this incantation:\n\nBorn of the Great Yin, essence of the Water trigram,\nCorresponding above to the Void and Danger constellations,\nTortoise and serpent unite in form,\nCirculating through the Six Directions, might subduing the ten thousand spirits,\nNo darkness unperceived, no wish unfulfilled,\nAt kalpa’s end and kalpa’s dawn, severing and vanquishing demonic essences,\nRescuing and protecting all beings, bringing peace to households and nations.\nWhen in the cycle the final Jia day arrives and demonic qi flows,\nThe Supreme Emperor issues his decree—\nI descend in numinous power to propagate the true Dharma,\nDispelling evil and averting warfare, nurturing the multitudes,\nAiding the flourishing of the Middle Revival.\nShould any petty demon dare manifest,\nMy single gaze shall topple the Five Peaks.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and decrees!\n\nThe ritual invocation said:",

      "translated_text": "At dawn, drink from the Orchid Pool; at dusk, lodge in the Golden Chamber. Sun and moon intertwine their girdles, the Dark Shade shelters the Purple Void. The hun-soul is at peace, the po-soul is serene; the ten thousand spirits guard their abodes. The Four Perfected hold the covenant, descending in cloud-borne chariots to ascend the Golden Gates, their names inscribed in the Emperor’s register.\n\nWhen the incantation is complete, lie down. Practicing this Way for eight years, the body emits wondrous radiance, a circular halo crowns the neck, illuminating the eight directions. Riding clouds, one soars aloft and ascends to heaven in broad daylight.\n\nOn this day, one receives refinement at the Golden Gate, is crowned and girdled in the Cavern of Yang, bathes in the Eastern Well, and is nurtured in the Vast Cold. Circulating through the four quarters for one hundred and eighty days, one returns above the Golden Gate.\n\nThe celestial reckoning speaks of three thousand six hundred cycles: when yang qi is obstructed and yin qi surges, the convergence of the Hundred and Six brings myriad calamities to the world, and heaven’s divisions alter their measures. The adept must follow the day’s movement, gathering yang essence to evade the Hundred and Six’s disasters.\n\nThe moon spans one thousand nine hundred *li* in breadth; its halo encircles seven thousand eight hundred and forty *li*. Within, white silver, lapis lazuli, and crystal water reflect, their one part divided into sixty, their blazing light shining without. Within it lie cities and people, as well as seven-jeweled bathing pools and forests of eight *qian* trees. The moon’s inhabitants stand one *zhang* and six *chi* tall, all clad in garments of azure hue.\n\nFrom the first to the sixteenth day of the lunar month, the moon’s people gather white silver and lapis lazuli, refining them in the forge of blazing light—thus the moon waxes, its radiance bright. From the seventeenth to the twenty-ninth day, within the *qian* forests, they gather the blossoms of the Three Qi, brushing away the light of sun and moon—thus the moon wanes, its light dim.\n\nThe Dark Radiance’s movement is governed by the Five Winds, which weave its warp. Thus it regulates the sun, moon, and starry lodges, coursing through the Void without cease.\n\nOn the Autumnal Equinox, when the moon lodges above the Eastern Well, in the Hall of Vast Numinosity, one bathes in the Eastern Well’s pool to refine the moon’s hun-soul and brighten the Eightfold Clarity’s rays. On this day, the moon receives yang essence from the sun’s brilliance, exhaling yellow qi into the Jade Pool. On the Autumnal Equinox, the hosts of heaven gather the flowers of the Ring Tree to brush the light of sun and moon, and the moon pours yellow qi to anoint the countenances of heaven’s people. Thus the Autumnal Equinox is the day of heaven’s grand assembly, the time when yellow qi and yang essence intermingle and descend.\n\nFor those who seek the Dao of immortality, on the Autumnal Equinox at dawn, enter the chamber, face west, and recline or sit as desired. Close the eyes and inwardly envision the White Radiance Lady of the Moon, whose surname is [omitted] and given name [omitted]. She stands six *cun* and six *fen* tall, her hair bound in a cloud-like topknot, clad in a soaring skirt of plain brocade. Her mouth holds moonlight, which descends into the adept’s body, settling within the Gate of Life.\n\nAfter a moment, the moonlight scatters into yellow qi, enveloping the entire body. The White Radiance Lady stands within the full moon, gathering the flowers of the Ring Tree and scattering them amid the yellow qi. From her mouth, she exhales yang essence—crimson in hue—which pours into the adept’s form, from within to without. Yellow and crimson qi intertwine, suffusing the entire body.\n\nThe Lady bestows upon the adept six red characters in purple script. Then draw in yellow qi thirty-six times and yang essence twenty-four times, then cease. Knock the teeth twenty-four times and recite the prayer with upturned face:\n\n*\"Azure Pool, numinous abyss,\nFlying springs exhale fragrance.\nEssence pours into cinnabar radiance,\nScattering blossoms in the numinous hall.\nYang descends as jade mushrooms,\nYin qi blends with yellow.\nThe Two Radiant Ones conceal their glow,\nThe Three Ways follow their course.\nThe Lady is crowned and girdled,\nBathed in blazing light.\nWith her saliva she anoints the body,\nOrchid’s moisture overflows.\nRed script in purple characters\nMirrors the Six Palaces.\nWithin, the Golden Immortal is transformed;\nWithout, flying dragons descend.\nJade chariots and feathered canopies,\nDark canopies soar on high.\nCloud-borne steeds come to welcome,\nFour convergences, eight connections.\nThe Seven Luminaries and Purple Radiance\nSoar through the Great Void.\"*\n\nWhen the incantation is complete, swallow qi thirty-six times and saliva twenty-four times, then cease. Ingest the purple-script red characters.\n\nPracticing this Way for eight years, the Lady manifests in form, speaking with the adept. The entire body emits purple and azure light, traversing the Dark Void, and the immortal ascends to heaven.\n\nThe above are the hidden sounds of the moon’s hun-soul in red characters of purple script, inscribed upon the leaves of the *qian* trees in the moon’s eastern precincts—a script of natural formation. Those who ingest these characters attain longevity of ten thousand years.\n\nThough there are dozens of methods for practicing the Way of the Sun and Moon, these sounds are no longer transmitted. To recklessly divulge them invites the punishment of wind and blade in this life, while seven generations of ancestors are consigned to the boundless hells of ghostly retribution, suffering the Three Paths and Five Torments for ten thousand kalpas without release.\n\nOn the Autumnal Equinox at dawn, face east, inscribe the purple script in cinnabar upon paper, ingest it, knock the teeth twelve times, and softly recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Dark Radiance, bright and clear,\nPurple qi, resplendent light.\nRising swiftly with the sun,\nFour and six in harmony.\nWithout, brushing crimson blossoms;\nWithin, knitting the Eight Rays.\nPurple Dao flows in brilliance,\nMy body at ease and full.\nRiding the radiant chariot,\nI ascend to the Emperor’s hall.\"*\n\nWhen the incantation is complete, swallow qi twenty-four times, then cease. Again, inscribe the red characters upon purple paper and wear them at the crown of the head for three years. A purple radiance three *chi* in length will crown the head, and six Jade Maidens will attend, imparting numinous sounds. To recklessly inform three others is to die and become a ghostly official.\n\nOnly those whose names are inscribed in gold and whose characters are written in jade may transmit this to one person in a hundred years. Guard it in secrecy, and one becomes an immortal, soaring through the Upper Clarity.\n\nOn the Winter Solstice, the moon retreats to the Palace of Vast Cold. The Palace of Vast Cold is the moon’s upper abode, where at this time the moon’s hun-soul is nurtured in its pools. On this day, one receives yellow qi into the Jade Womb and exhales yang essence into the Cold Pool. The hosts of heaven, on this day, gather the blossoms of the Azure Forest to brush the light of sun and moon, and the moon pours yang essence to anoint the countenances of heaven’s people. Thus the Winter Solstice is the time when the Way’s movement treads the long path, the moment when yellow qi and yang essence receive radiance.\n\nFor those who seek the Dao of immortality, on the Winter Solstice at noon, enter the chamber, face north, and recline or sit as desired. Close the eyes and inwardly envision the Dark Radiance Lady of the Moon, whose surname is [omitted] and given name [omitted]. She stands five *cun* and five *fen* tall, her hair bound in a cloud-like topknot, clad in a soaring skirt of dark brocade. Her mouth holds moonlight, which descends into the adept’s heart.",

Looking upward, the adept recites the incantation:\n\nDark Yin Cold Pool, flowing springs in vast courtyards,\nFlying blossoms scatter radiance, exhaling yellow and inhaling essence.\nThe two qi entwine, jade mushrooms sprout in emptiness,\nHeavenly beings sip fragrance, the Lady lends her numinous wings.\nOrchid pools surge, flowing yellow veils the dark,\nThroughout the heavens, absorb radiance, descend upon my form.\nRestore youth, refine countenance, reverse white to bind green,\nPurple script of the Eastern Palace, cinnabar writings link names.\nWinged steeds and feathered canopies, four perfected ones guard the chariot,\nBear me aloft together, ascend to Jade Clarity.\n\nWhen the incantation is complete, the adept swallows qi thirty times and saliva twenty-four times, then ingests the purple-script cinnabar characters.\n\nPracticing this Way for eight years, the Lady bestows upon the adept the Bright Moon Pendants and the cinnabar-script Dao, enabling flight through the mysterious void and ascent to Jade Clarity.\n\nThe above purple-script cinnabar characters and hidden tones of the Moon Soul are all inscribed in the Azure Forest of the moon’s northern realm, forming natural script.\n\nAugust Supreme Perfected Ones and all heavenly beings, on the Winter Solstice, gather and ingest these purple-script cinnabar characters.\n\nThose who ingest these six characters will have boundless luminous radiance suffuse their bodies, sharing the same lifespan as the heavenly beings.\n\nThis method is most solemn; it is a secret of the Celestial Lord. To recklessly divulge these numinous tones invites the trial of wind blades upon one’s body, while seven generations of ancestors will be consigned to the endless torments of ghostly servitude, enduring the three paths and five sufferings for ten thousand kalpas without reprieve.\n\nOn the Winter Solstice at noon, face north and inscribe the characters in ink upon green paper, then ingest them. Knock the teeth twelve times and softly recite the incantation:\n\nSupporting dawn, bathing in radiance’s net,\nCircular light flourishes in Jade Clarity.\nMysterious brilliance crowns the brocade union,\nGreat Desert mirrors the cinnabar numen.\nFragrant pearls govern hidden awakening,\nPurple script intersperses azure blossoms.\nAugust Supreme illuminates the Dao’s branches,\nMist and splendor pervade the empty brightness.\nWash me in the Yellow Qi Pool,\nRinse me with the Great Yang Essence.\nAbove, brush the Radiant Forest’s midst,\nLooking up, sip the heavenly beings’ essence.\nSoaring through layered mysteries above,\nSun and moon share the same root’s glory.\n\nWhen the incantation is complete, swallow qi twenty-four times and stop.\n\nFurther, inscribe cinnabar script upon purple silk and wear it upon the head. Boundless luminous radiance will then suffuse the adept’s form, and six Jade Maidens will be granted to guard the adept’s body, along with six Jade Lads to protect the adept’s person.\n\nTo recklessly speak of these numinous tones and reveal them to three others is to be consigned to ghostly officials in death, never again to attain immortality.\n\nWithin a hundred years, if one encounters the *Golden Name Imperial Chart*, the *Green Script of Purple Clarity*, it may be transmitted to a single person. Secretly mastering it, one becomes a divine immortal, flying through the great void.\n\nOn the Spring Equinox, when the moon lodges above the Golden Gate, there lies the Gate of Communion with the Numinous. At that time, the moon refines within the Golden Essence Smelting Pool, tempered by the Stone Radiance Water Mother and adorned by the Flower Light.\n\nOn this day, yang essence is poured into the Golden Gate, and yellow qi is received into the Jade Spring. August Supreme Perfected Ones and all heavenly beings gather on this day to pluck blossoms from the *Qian* trees, brushing the light of sun and moon. The moon pours yellow qi to anoint the countenances of heaven’s people. Thus the Spring Equinox is the time when the myriad qi intermingle in harmony, when divine radiance coalesces, and when yellow qi and yang essence descend to meet.\n\nFor those who seek the Dao of immortality, on the Spring Equinox at dusk, enter the chamber, face west, and recline or sit as desired. Close the eyes and inwardly envision the Azure Radiance Lady of the Moon, whose surname is [omitted] and given name [omitted]. She stands nine *cun* tall, her hair bound in a cloud-like topknot, clad in a soaring skirt of azure brocade. Her mouth holds moonlight, which descends upon the adept’s two eyes.\n\nAfter a moment, the moonlight scatters into yellow qi, suffusing the entire form. The Lady stands at the moon’s center, gathering blossoms from the *Qian* Forest and scattering them amid the yellow qi. From her mouth she exhales yang essence—red in color—which pours over the adept’s form, weaving inward to outward. The yellow and red qi intertwine, suffusing the entire body.\n\nThe Lady bestows upon the adept six purple-script cinnabar characters in secret tones. Then she guides the adept to swallow yellow qi twenty-four times and yang essence sixteen times, then to knock the teeth twenty-four times. Looking upward, the adept recites the incantation:\n\nEightfold smelting of the Golden Crucible,\nCinnabar Pool’s vast abyss,\nJade nectar surges,\nFlowing to scatter the eight *Qian*.\nYellow qi rises in dense clouds,\nYang essence congeals as mist.\nGathering blossoms in the Orchid Court,\nFlying skirts flutter in profusion.\nThe Lady sips fragrance,\nAugust Supreme pours divine fluid.\nGentle radiance melts in season,\nMoistening all heavens.\nCinnabar brilliance shines in eight directions,\nLuminous clarity pervades.\nReflected glory curves and gleams,\nDescending upon my body.\nAttaining union with the Moon Soul,\nPreserving numinous years forever,\nRiding the void, steering the floating,\nAscending to the boundless.\n\nWhen the incantation is complete, the adept swallows qi twenty-four times and saliva sixteen times, then ingests the purple-script cinnabar characters.\n\nPracticing this Way for eight years, the Lady bestows upon the adept the true tones of the cinnabar script. Moon blossoms scatter to brush the adept’s body, and the face assumes a golden countenance, enabling flight to the Upper Clarity.\n\nThe above purple-script cinnabar characters and hidden tones of the Moon Soul are all inscribed in the *Qian* Forest of the moon’s western realm, forming natural script.\n\nAugust Supreme Perfected Ones and all heavenly beings, on the Spring Equinox, gather and ingest these purple-script cinnabar characters.\n\nThose who ingest these six characters will have flaming radiance suffuse their bodies, and the seven treasures of the moon’s jade pendants will become clearly visible.\n\nThis method is most secret; the August Supreme inscribes these tones within the Jade Chapters of the August Supreme, thus forming the Dragon Script of the Highest. To recklessly divulge these numinous tones is to consign seven generations of ancestors to punishment, to be bound in servitude to ghostly officials, to suffer the trial of wind blades, and never to attain immortality.",

      "translated_text": "On the Spring Equinox at the *bu* hour, write in white on yellow paper and ingest it. Strike the teeth twelve times and softly recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Great radiance illumines the central heavens,\nBright rosy clouds adorn the golden chamber.\nJade characters array auspicious clouds,\nCinnabar script forms clustered groves.\nFlying songs scatter through the vermilion forest,\nIn the profound vastness of the Great Desert,\nNuminous tones sing of themselves,\nSubtle words of the Eight Pure Palaces.\nAll heavens inhale golden fragrance,\nFlowing essences bathe my countenance.\nSpirit conjoins with the virtue of heaven and humanity,\nThe August Supreme descends with the Purple Youth,\nConveying me to soar through the Nine Voids,\nAscending to the Vermilion Moon Palace.\"*\n\nWhen the incantation is complete, swallow qi twenty-four times. Then write in cinnabar above the purple script and wear it at the crown of the head. After three years, natural purple radiance will suffuse one’s form, and six Jade Maidens will be granted.\n\nTo recklessly divulge these numinous tones to three persons is to consign oneself to death at the hands of ghostly officials, to bind seven generations of ancestors in servitude, and to remain unredeemed for ten thousand kalpas.\n\nWithin a hundred years, if a Perfected One deigns to transmit this once, it is sufficient to attain divine transcendence and soar through the Highest Clarity.\n\n---\n\nOn the Summer Solstice, the moon resides in the Cavern Yang Palace. The Cavern Yang Palace is the moon’s upper abode; at this time, the moon refines itself in the Flowing Fire Courtyard, smelting within the Eight Rays and growing resplendent in the Moon Soul.\n\nOn this day, infuse yellow qi into the Cavern Yang, and absorb yang essence into the Fire Palace. The Eight Pure Perfected Ones and all heavenly beings, on this day, gather from the Azure Void Forest to brush away the brilliance of the sun and moon. The moon, with yang essence, bathes the countenances of the heavenly beings.\n\nThus, on the Summer Solstice, when luminous qi excites yang essence, descending yin and absorbing the numinous, it is the moment when the Two Luminaries conjoin their radiance.\n\nFor those who seek the Dao of immortality: on the Summer Solstice at midnight, enter a chamber facing south, recline or sit as desired, close the eyes, and inwardly visualize the Cinnabar Radiance Lady of the Moon, whose surname is □ and given name □. Her form is eight inches and eight fen tall, her hair bound in a cascading cloud chignon, clad in a vermilion brocade flying skirt. She holds moonbeams in her mouth, descending into the Crimson Palace within one’s body.\n\nPresently, the moonlight scatters into yellow qi. With each descent of a form, the Lady stands at the moon’s center, gathering azure void blossoms and scattering them amid the yellow qi. She exhales yang essence—yang essence is red—and bathes one’s form, from within to without. Yellow and red qi intertwine, illuminating the entire body.\n\nThe Lady bestows the six cinnabar characters of the purple script upon one’s body, then draws in yellow qi, swallowing it twenty-four times, and draws in yang essence twelve times before stopping. Strike the teeth twenty-four times and recite the incantation while looking upward:\n\n*\"Flowing Fire spans ten thousand leagues,\nEssence of the Cavern Yang,\nAbode of Yang’s Peace,\nTriple Flower Jade City.\nGolden immortals shine within,\nEight Pure and Fourfold Clarity,\nNine Luminaries descend their qi,\nPrimal Highest Numinous Ones.\nThe Lady inhales fragrance,\nScatters flowers in Jade Clarity.\nCinnabar script in purple characters,\nVoices conjoined with the Azure Void.\nOrchid pools and jade smoothness,\nFlowing through the Eight Darknesses.\nVermilion radiance veils all,\nHeavenly immortals grow resplendent.\nRevolving dawn’s curved brilliance,\nIlluminates and oversees my form.\nTo share life and death with the Vermilion Moon,\nRiding the void, driving the flying chariot,\nJade Maidens flank my position,\nGolden Lads assist my spirit.\nKingfisher plumes light the canopy,\nAscending to the Imperial Court.\"*\n\nWhen the incantation is complete, swallow qi twenty-four times and saliva twenty times before stopping, then ingest the cinnabar characters of the purple script.\n\nPracticing this Dao for eight years, the Lady will bestow upon one the true script of the cinnabar script, the moon’s jade pendants, enabling one to ascend and soar to the Cavern Yang Palace.\n\n---\n\nThe cinnabar characters of the Moon Soul’s hidden tones are all inscribed in the Azure Void Forest of the moon’s southern realm, forming natural script. The Eight Pure Perfected Ones and all heavenly beings, on the Summer Solstice, gather and ingest these cinnabar characters of the purple script.\n\nThose who ingest these six characters will share the same age as the Eight Pure, their nape bearing a circular luminosity that illumines the ten directions.\n\nThis method is most secret; the August Supreme Eight Pure Perfected Ones inscribe these tones within the Jade Chapters of the Eight Pure, thus forming the wondrous scripture of the Highest. To recklessly divulge these numinous tones is to consign seven generations of ancestors to punishment, to be cast into the Mountain of Knives, to suffer the trial of wind blades, and never to attain immortality.\n\n---\n\nOn the Summer Solstice at midnight, write in vermilion on white paper and ingest it. Strike the teeth twelve times and softly recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Yang essence in the cinnabar pool,\nFlowing Fire and swirling winds,\nGolden chariots wing the void,\nMysterious radiance brushes the heavens.\nEight Pure gather orchids,\nScatter fragrance in the Jade Court.\nAzure forests hang willows,\nWind stirs the jade branches.\nCinnabar script in purple characters,\nHolding elegance and flourishing splendor.\nFlowing fragrance bathes the essences,\nUniversally moistening without bound.\nTo share the mysterious radiance,\nEqual in brilliance to the Purple Empyrean.\"*\n\nWhen the incantation is complete, swallow qi twenty-four times, then write in cinnabar above the purple script and wear it at the crown of the head.

The sun’s path is yang, the moon’s path is yin; though they revolve together, in their adornments, each resides in the four seasons.\n\nThus, the sun divides one hundred eighty days of yang, the moon divides one hundred eighty days of yin. Their cycles traverse three thousand six hundred degrees, and when they conjoin, yang qi excites while yin qi stagnates. When the Great Yang’s ninefold cycle completes its revolution, heaven and earth alter their lodgings, myriad plagues disperse, and evil and misfortune are eradicated.\n\nScholars who do not comprehend the revolutions of heaven and earth cannot escape the calamities of the Nine Yangs. Among those who accumulate learning, few attain the dragon chariot and ascend to the cloud towers. In vain do they labor in mountain caves, abstain from grains, swallow saliva, and ingest the essences of the sun and moon, yet remain ignorant of the divisions of the mysterious radiance—the vastness and narrowness of the celestial walled cities, the Seven Treasures and Vermilion Forests, the revolutions of the lodgings through the four quarters, the phases of waxing and waning.\n\nThe flying roots cannot be plucked, the imperial blossoms cannot be gathered. Yang essence will not descend, yin essence will not illumine. The Dao of the sun and moon remains distant indeed.",

      "translated_text": "If one diligently seeks its root and comprehends the revolutions of the radiant degrees—knowing the celestial walled cities and earthly ruins, the Vermilion Forests and abyssal pools, the names and surnames of the Lady of the Moon—then the sun and moon will respond and descend, sparing one the arduous toil of distant seeking. Naturally, one may ride the cloud chariot and flying wheels to ascend to the gates of the sun and moon.\n\nThe purple script and cinnabar characters are bound within the spontaneous qi of the Eight Purities. The lofty and mysterious feathered chapters give life to the Eight Auspicious Forests of the moon, their characters suffused with purple radiance, gleaming brighter than the moon’s own light. The Eight Perfected of the Eight Purities and all the heavens gather the purple script and cinnabar characters from the Eight Auspicious Forests to ingest them, scattering incense to brush the light of the sun and moon. These sounds all express the *Great Cavern Perfected Scripture*, hence they are called the \"exalted texts.\" Those who ingest these characters will bear a golden countenance, their necks crowned with circular luminosity; the sun and moon will illumine them through and through, and they shall ascend as immortals without study. This method is most solemn, a secret of the exalted ones, not to be lightly disclosed. According to the precepts, within seven hundred years, if one bears the golden name of Eastern Florescence and the purple characters of Supreme Purity, a person of true harmony, they may receive its threefold transmission. Without such destiny, it must be sealed within the Jade Gate, never to be revealed for ten thousand kalpas.\n\n---\n\n**Eightfold Refinement: Alchemical Transmutation of the Perfected Talisman**\nOn the day of the Beginning of Spring, inscribe in yellow upon blue paper and cast into water for bathing. The entire body will be refined and transformed, summoning the mysterious radiance of the sun and moon and descending the Perfected into the Jade Court. Also, inscribe in yellow upon blue silk and wear it on the body for eight years to converse with the Perfected, who will descend with cloud chariots, ascending above the Golden Gate to receive refinement in the Alchemical Pool.\n\n---\n\n**Eightfold Refinement: Elixir Embryo Jade Talisman**\nAt noon on the day of the Beginning of Summer, inscribe in cinnabar upon yellow paper and cast into water for bathing. Both inner and outer will be refined and transformed, summoning the flying roots from the yang essence and drawing forth yellow qi from the Yellow Blossoms, turning the sun and moon to mysterious illumination and evoking the Perfected within the Jade Characters. Also, inscribe in cinnabar upon yellow silk and wear it on the body for eight years; the Perfected will descend to bestow the true script upon the aspirant, who shall ascend through the void to the Cavern Yang Palace.\n\n---\n\n**Ninefold Refinement of the Dragon Radiance Talisman**\nAt the hour of *bu* on the day of the Beginning of Autumn, inscribe in blue upon white paper and cast into water for bathing. The bones and marrow will be refined and transformed, summoning the mysterious radiance from the Purple Radiance, drawing the yang essence to the flying roots, and gathering the yellow qi into the Water Mother, descending the Perfected into the Purple Pavilion. Also, inscribe in blue upon white silk and wear it on the body for eight years; one’s head will bear the circular luminosity of the sun, enabling flight through the Grand Palace to ascend to the Hall of Vast Numinosity.\n\n---\n\n**Sun Soul: Refinement of Yin Essence Talisman**\nAt midnight on the day of the Beginning of Winter, inscribe in ink upon blue paper and cast into water for bathing. The blood and essence of the entire body will be refined and transformed, drawing the solar essence into the Purple Radiance, descending flying blossoms upon the Eight Auspicious Forests, refining the Five Palaces in the Jade Pool, and transporting the aspirant’s body to the Palace of Vast Cold. Also, inscribe in ink upon blue silk and wear it on the body for eight years; the body will emit golden light, the neck crowned with circular luminosity, and the Perfected will descend to bestow the true script, enabling flight through the Grand Void to ascend to the Palace of Vast Cold.\n\nThe Seven Stars lie four hundred thousand *li* from the earth, encircling seven hundred and twenty *li*, their walled cities forged of golden essence and lapis lazuli. The Seven Luminaries cast their purple radiance, illuminating their interiors—palaces where the hosts of heavenly beings and Perfected roam. The Palace of Vast Cold is their canopy. In one day and night, they complete a single revolution around the heavens, just as the wheels of the sun and moon. Within them grow Seven Treasures and Vermilion Forests. When, after settling into meditation, the initial breath of life arises, the Seven Stars receive refinement in the Palace of Vast Cold, their purple radiance gleaming brightly amidst the luminaries’ glow. At this time, the Seven Luminaries blaze and scatter, their essence streaming across the heavens, while the purple radiance emits its nectar to irrigate all the heavens. Thus, all the Perfected and Divine Immortals, without exception, gather the radiance of the Seven Luminaries and the orchids of the purple radiance.\n\nFor scholars who ingest the Dao of the sun and moon, they must cultivate the wondrous methods of the Seven Luminaries. After settling into meditation, retire to a separate chamber, burn incense, lie with the head to the north, compose the body and stabilize the spirit, abandoning all stray thoughts. Focus the mind upon the numinous, knock the teeth twenty-four times, and visualize the Seven Stars blazing brightly in the north. Envision oneself lying beneath the canopy of the Dipper amidst the Seven Stars, the light of the Seven Luminaries streaming beyond the purple radiance, crowning one’s body. One’s body rests above the purple radiance and within the Seven Luminaries, all within and without shrouded in darkness, nothing visible. After a long while, the light of the Seven Luminaries parts, transforming into seven youths, each upon a star.\n\nThe first youth is named *Shuming*, the second *Yaoling*, the third *Beiyuan*, the fourth *Baojing*, the fifth *Danying*, the sixth *Xuqing*, and the seventh *Ziying*.

To know their names is to escape death; to cultivate their method is to attain immortality. To reveal their taboo names is to invite blindness. By recalling them morning and evening, they will perpetually guard the adept’s body.

      "translated_text": "The Supreme One commanded the Four Directors, the Five Emperors, and the various Heavenly Kings to dispatch the Inspectors of Perfected Immortals, who perpetually traverse the Five Marchmounts and all renowned mountains. In the world, there are the essentials of the Three Ways—the method of the Yellow Qi and Yang Essence, and the scriptures of cinnabar writing in purple characters. Those who possess these are listed in the Eastern Flower, their names memorialized in the Golden Portal, and seven jade lads and seven jade maidens each attend the body of those who hold the scriptures.\n\nShould one lightly divulge the numinous sounds or neglect the precious texts, the jade lads will report this, and the Five Emperors’ divine soldiers will punish them, condemning them to death and servitude amidst the Three Paths and Five Sufferings. Their seven generations of ancestors will bear the blame, and for ten thousand kalpas, there shall be no deliverance. Those who cultivate the essentials of the Three Ways must, on the third, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days of the lunar month—three days each month—face the light of the sun and moon. At midnight, they pay homage to the essence of the Seven Stars, bowing twice and concentrating their minds, aspiring to ascend to the radiance of the Three Luminaries and partake of the divine splendor of their countenances. After seven years of such practice, the sun and moon will respond and descend, bestowing upon them the Dao of the Divine Perfected.\n\nIf one’s name is inscribed in gold and jade and recorded in the Mysterious Chart, and one is deemed worthy of receiving this scripture, the master must observe the covenant with a fast of ninety days, or twenty-seven days, or three days. The disciple shall present seven taels of gold, forty feet of yellow silk, and thirty-two feet of blue silk, and the transmission shall proceed after the oath is sworn. Without the covenant, to lightly divulge it will subject the master to interrogation and the forfeiture of their body, while the disciple, for glimpsing the celestial perfected, will violate the covenant and suffer mutilation. Their seven generations of ancestors will incur guilt, and for three trials, there shall be no deliverance.\n\nThe celestial writings are wondrous and weighty; the cinnabar script in purple characters is most secret. Thus, it is treasured with covenantal faith and must not be lightly transmitted. Scholars who suffer this interrogation must be prudent and reverent. This numinous scripture was born within the Great Void, inscribed upon the Dark Garden above, in the shade of the Piled Stones, within the golden halls and jade chambers. The numinous text shines brilliantly, its purple characters soaring through the clouds, while three thousand divine lads and three thousand jade maidens, wielding incense, attend the divine perfected.\n\nThe Supreme Primordial Sovereign of the Southern Culmen received it from the Supreme One and cast the covenant into the Great Void, transmitting it to the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity. The Celestial Emperor transmitted it to the Queen Mother of the Western Tortoise, who passed it to the Emperor of the Golden Portal. The Emperor entrusted it to the Azure Lad of the Highest Minister, who was to transmit it to later scholars worthy of becoming perfected immortals. Now, one copy is sealed within the Western City Mountain.\n\nThose who study immortality but do not cultivate this Way labor in vain to summon the perfected. They may attain only lesser immortality and escape death, but to hope to unlock the Celestial Gate and ascend to the Golden Portal shall forever remain beyond their reach. Once one masters the Three Ways and practices the Eight Refinements, even if one does not achieve ascension in broad daylight, on the day of transformation, one will naturally ascend to the Golden Gate and the palaces of the Four Quarters. There, one shall undergo further refinement in the Jade Pool, receive the feathered raiment of golden wings, and ascend to the palace of the Golden Portal.\n\nThus, this method is lofty and wondrous, incomparable to ordinary scriptures. Those who obtain its text shall become immortals without even practicing it. The immortals Zhonghuang, Xuanzisheng, Mo Di, Zhao Yanfu, Ning Kangbo, Peng Jian, An Qi, and Bogao, along with seven hundred others, sought the Dao and endured hardships, their devotion reaching the Jade Void. Though they soared to the cliffs of the heavens and roamed the Five Marchmounts, they did not obtain the essentials of the Three Ways and thus could not ascend within the Golden Gate or receive the protocols of the Golden Portal. Now, they ride the winds through the empty clouds, serving as charioteers for the Jade Clarity and escorts for the highest perfected—how different is this from those who, in their early studies, toil in the lower realms yet aspire to wander the Cloudy Portal?\n\nIn contrast, Su Zilin, Gu Xizi, Youyang Jun, Wang Qiao, Chisong, Huangren, and Qingzhen, from the outset of their studies, cultivated the essentials of the Three Ways—the method of the Yellow Qi and Yang Essence, and the cinnabar script in purple characters. Thus, they swiftly transcended the Three Clarities, ascended to the Palace of Azure Flower, and received the wondrous scriptures of the highest grade. They journeyed to the Golden Portal to receive their titles, attaining the rank of the highest perfected immortals of the Jade Clarity and the Four Poles. How different is this from those of mere aspiration?\n\nThe Perfected King transmitted this scripture to the Lady of the Southern Marchmount, and it is now sealed within the chamber of the Southern Grotto of the Yang Bathing Palace. Those with aspiration should diligently seek its text.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Yellow Qi, Yang Essence, and Three Ways in Sequential Practice* concludes.",
