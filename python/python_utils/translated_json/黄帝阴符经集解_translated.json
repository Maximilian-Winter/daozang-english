  "full_translation": "**Yellow Emperor’s *Yin Fu Jing* with Commentaries**\n\n**Title:** *Yellow Emperor’s Yin Fu Jing with Commentaries*\nOriginal attribution: Composed by the Ten True Persons, including赤松子 and others. According to *Daozang Ti Yao*, this is a spurious work falsely attributed to Southern Song and Jin-Yuan Daoists. Three scrolls.\nSource: *Zhengtong Daozang*, *Dongzhen* section, *Yujue* category.\n\n**Volume One: Commentaries by the Ten True Persons**\n赤松子, 张良 (Zifang True Person), 太极左仙 (Taiji Left Immortal), 翁葛玄 (Weng Ge Xuan), 许逊 (Xishan True Person), 钟离权 (Zhengyang True Person), 吕洞宾 (Pure Yang True Person), 华阳真人, 施肩吾, 崔明公 (Zhi Yi True Person), 刘玄英 (Hai Can True Person), 曹道冲 (Qingxu True Person).\n\n钟离权 said:\n*\"Huang\"* is the central color, *\"Di\"* the sovereign’s title.\nCentrality governs the Five Phases; sovereignty rules all things.\n*\"Yin\"* is the root of nature, *\"Fu\"* the foundation of fate—this is the essence of the *Yin Fu*.\n\nWithin, it cultivates the self; without, it governs the family and state.\nIt encompasses Heaven and Earth, commands all directions.\nAll ancient and modern Daoists who attained the Way did so through this principle, reaching *wuwei* (non-action).\n\n张子房’s praise:\n*\"Know that Heaven’s Five is Central Yellow,\nThe Sovereign’s Primordial Law—Central King.\nThe Immortals all grasp the *Yin Fu*’s logic,\nGovern the state, cultivate the self, and enter the Sage’s realm.\"*\n\n曹道冲’s *Qingxiao Le*:\n*\"The heart is the sovereign’s image—Central Yellow,\nThe spirit’s impartial use brings the Dao’s flourishing.\nYin is the nature’s root—lead is precious,\nRecorded as Heaven’s treasure, the fate’s *Fu* is Yang.\nThe scripture spreads teachings, opening expedients,\nUniversal salvation for the lost—great voyage.\nWait only for success to be fulfilled,\nThe Ten Isles’ Immortal Lands are home.\"*\n\n**The Immortals Embrace Unity in Daoist Practice**\n吕洞宾 said:\n*\"Heaven One generates Water, Earth Two generates Fire—\nIn man, this is *jing* (essence).\nThe spirit is born of the Dao, the form of *jing*.\nGuard it and do not lose it—united with the Mysterious,\nThen spirit and essence merge yet remain distinct.\nGather essence to refine the spirit,\nUse the spirit to govern *qi*,\nRefine the spirit to merge with the Dao—\nThus, with Heaven, endure eternally.\nHence the *Dao De Jing* says:\n‘Embrace Unity—how could it depart?’\nAnd again:\n‘Embrace Unity as the model for all under Heaven.’\nLong ago, Guangchengzi admonished the Yellow Emperor:\n‘Do not exhaust your form, do not agitate your essence,\nFew desires and little thought—thus longevity is attained.’\nThis is the essence of the Immortals’ embrace of Unity.\"*\n\n葛仙翁’s praise:\n*\"From the Primordial Yellow’s chaos, life begins,\nSupporting transformation, establishing Heaven and Earth.\nSeekers of longevity must find the Dao—\nTaiyi’s True One is the True One itself.\"*\n崔明公’s *Linjiang Xian*:\n*\"The vital *qi*’s root is fate’s ancestor,\nFocused embrace of the Mysterious True.\nIn the dim void, the Original Essence hides,\nThe Perfect Man first attends to the root—\nRoot established, the Dao’s foundation set.\nPearls hidden in shells, jade in stone—\nEarth and Heaven endure eternally—\nAll from cherishing *Dao* and *De*,\nTranscending kalpas in serene peace.\nObserve Heaven’s Way, follow Heaven’s actions—\nThus all is complete.\nHence it is said:\n‘Observe Heaven’s Way, hold fast to Heaven’s actions—\nThus all is complete.’\"*\n\n赤松子’s praise:\n*\"Heaven’s Way is wordless, governing the Four Seasons,\nClouds move, rain falls—all things depend on it.\nPiercing the Mysterious Symbols, following Heaven’s decrees,\nBody this, cultivate the True—align with the Sage’s intent.\"*\n\n刘海蟾’s *Tingqian Liu*:\n*\"Heaven’s Way is the Primordial Yang,\nIts canopy is without bias, the stars suspended bright.\nAt Winter Solstice, Yang rises from Earth,\nAt Summer Solstice, the fluid descends to Heaven.\nThe Rabbit and Tortoise’s essences circulate,\nThus the revolving *Xuan* (celestial pivot) moves.\nObserve the Dao, name the four seasons and eight nodes—\nStudy them deeply.\nDaily actions mirror a year.\nAdvance the fire at midnight,\nAt times add mercury, extract lead,\nRefine the Golden Elixir—\nThen you are called an Immortal.\"*\n\n**Heaven’s Five Thieves**\n赤松子 said:\n*\"The Five Thieves are the Five Phases.\nIn Heaven, they are the Five Stars; in man, the Five Viscera.\nTo the eyes, they are the Five Colors;\nTo the ears, the Five Sounds;\nTo the nose, the Five Fragrances;\nTo the tongue, the Five Tastes;\nTo the body, the Five Touches;\nTo the heart, the Five Poisons—\nAll are called the Five Thieves.\nThief means harm.\nThese Five Phases’ *qi* each harbor life and death.\"*\n\nThe Way aligns—auspicious; it reverses—disastrous.\nWhen Heaven’s timing aligns, the four seasons harmonize in tranquility and abundance.\nWhen reversed, wars, famines, floods, droughts, locusts, and epidemics bring calamity.\nMan’s Five Thieves lie only in the heart.\nA rectified heart is gentle, compassionate, and pure—its deeds bring fortune;\nA disordered heart is harsh, cruel, licentious, and turbid—its deeds bring misfortune.\n*\"Seeing\"* means awakening.\nAwakening and clarity bring well-being to body and mind.\nThus it is said: *Heaven’s Five Thieves*—those who perceive them flourish.\n\n**Liu Haichan’s Ode:**\nThe Five Thieves rampage across the ten thousand realms—\nWood, Metal, Water, Fire, and the Central Phase.\nSevering warhorses and banishing demonic chaos,\nPerceiving them brings eternal peace to all under Heaven.\n\n**Cui Minggong’s *Sumu Zhe*:**\nThe Five Thieves’ schemes are formless, shadowless—\nThey torment the common folk, devouring each generation.\nWhen one organ weakens, another prevails;\nExhausting the body, it stems from excess yin.\nWhen the Spleen thrives, nourish the Kidneys—\nGreed, delusion, deceit, and jealousy all vanish.\nSeeing all as empty, the Five Aggregates dissolve—\nLife and nature endure, firm as Heaven’s permanence.\n\nThe Five Thieves reside in the heart, manifesting in Heaven.\n**Zifang** said:\nThe Five Thieves are: *thieves of life, of possessions, of merit, of timing, of spirit*.\nThese Five Thieves dwell in the heart, unseen yet advancing.\nAwakening and comprehending them is called *illuminating the natural*.\nWhen the spirit is steadied and qi harmonized, free of obstruction,\nActions align with cosmic patterns—just as Heaven operates.\nThe universe lies within the grasp; ten thousand transformations arise from the body.\n\n**Liu Haichan** said:\nFirst observe Heaven’s Dao, then clarify the Five Thieves,\nActing in accordance with Heaven’s command.\nThough vast as the cosmos, it does not escape the palm;\nThough myriad transformations exist, they all originate in the body.\n\n**Lü Zhenren’s Ode:**\nThe heart-mirror, clear and luminous—\nActions and deeds align with Heaven’s stars.\nJust and yielding, the cosmos rests in the hand;\nTen thousand transformations spring from the body alone.\n\n**Shi Zhenren’s *Bu Suanzhi*:**\nThe heart-mirror, clear and luminous—\nThe Five Thieves all vanish.\nWhen Heaven’s Dao moves, act accordingly—\nPreserve life as Heaven’s permanence.\nThe cosmos’ pivot lies in the grasp—\nCultivate virtue, steadfast and refined.\nTen thousand transformations arise from the body—\nEmbrace Oneness, the sacred function.\n\nHeaven’s nature is humanity.\nHuman heart is the mechanism.\nEstablish Heaven’s Dao to govern humanity.\n**Cui Minggong** said:\nHeaven’s nature and human heart originate from the same source.\nHeaven’s Dao is boundless void—\nSerene, it permeates the human heart.\nTheir source is identical:\nUsing Heaven’s nature to illuminate the human heart,\nGuiding the human heart to harmonize with Heaven’s mechanisms.\nTo establish Heaven’s Dao is to uphold *yin-yang*.\nTo establish humanity’s Dao is to practice *ren and yi*.\n*Ren, yi, loyalty, and trustworthiness*—\nExhaustlessly doing good—this is called *Heaven’s noble title*.\nFirst cultivate Heaven’s noble title to accumulate deeds,\nThen embody Heaven’s Dao to amass merit.\nThe most refined merit is *embracing Oneness*.\n\n**Zifang** said:\nThe Classic speaks of *Heaven’s nature*—humanity;\n*The human heart*—the mechanism.\nYet it does not say *human heart is Heaven*,\nFor all things emerge from the mechanism and return to the mechanism.\n\n**Xu Zhenren’s Ode:**\nThe Sovereign’s nature transforms and gives birth to humanity—\nHeaven’s nature and human heart share one luminous essence.\nGood deeds bear perfect fruit—\nSouthern Palace’s ranks bestow the title of Immortal.\n\n**Ge Xianweng’s *Xijiang Yue*:**\nThe Great Dao is formless, without attributes—\nIt generates Heaven, Earth, and humanity.\nHuman heart and Heaven’s nature share the same essence—\nSerene and effortless, the true foundation.\nThe superior sage embodies Heaven’s Dao—\nWhen the Dao is complete, what fear of dawn and dusk?\nPerfect merit brings auspicious fulfillment—\nThe Seven Ancestors ascend to the wondrous realm.\n\nWhen Heaven unleashes killing intent, dragons and serpents rise from the earth.\nWhen humanity unleashes killing intent, Heaven and Earth revolt.\n**Zifang** said:\nHeaven’s killing and generating mechanisms all align with their intent—\nNot arbitrary action.\n*\"Killing\"* means following yin with yang;\n*\"Mechanism\"* means adapting to the season.\nAt the Spring Equinox, the four yangs flourish,\nThe two yins weaken—\nHeaven’s Dao issues commands: thunder roars,\nIts voice shakes the abyss, awakening all things,\nForcing dragons and serpents, and all hidden creatures,\nTo rise from the earth—this is Heaven’s killing intent.\nThe foolish, unaware of Heaven’s Dao,\nUnleash reckless schemes—\nGreedy for gain, ambitious for fame,\nThey topple others, harming all—\nThen Heaven’s retribution brings disasters, calamities, and chaos upon them.\nThis is called *Heaven and Earth’s reversal*.\n\n**Liu Haichan** said:\nFrom *Heaven’s nature is humanity* to *governing humanity*—\nThis is the Dao’s constancy;\nFrom *Heaven’s killing intent* to *Heaven and Earth’s reversal*—\nThis is the Dao’s transformation.\nThe constant upholds *just and yielding* to establish order;\nThe transformative adapts *yin-yang* to the seasons.\n\n**Shi Zhenren’s Ode:**\nThunder’s voice stirs Heaven’s might—\nIt startles dragons and serpents, awakening all.\nThis is the profound mechanism of true transformation—\nTo master this Dao is to unite with *Xiqí*.\n\n**Xu Zhenren’s Ode:**\nWhen humanity unleashes reckless schemes, calamity arises—\nTipping nations into ruin, families into peril.\nThose who mourn lost kingdoms and homes—\nEven the Jin Valley and Zhanghua Palace remain unaware.\n\n**Lü Zhenren’s *Linjiang Xian*:**\nThe gnomon’s shadow shifts with the seasons,\nThe four yangs command the Spring Equinox.\nHeaven’s might thunders with lightning—\nDragons and serpents all rise from the earth,\nHidden creatures awaken in alarm.\n\nThe lowly scholar knows not Heaven’s Dao’s intent,\nYet schemes wildly for profit and gain.\nHe digs pits for others, harms life and things—\nHis misfortunes cannot be undone,\nHis ruin comes from his own reckless tilt.\n\nWhen Heaven and humanity act in unison,\nAll transformations rest upon a fixed foundation.\n\nXu Zhenren says:\nHeaven gains *Oneness* to attain clarity,\nHumanity gains *Oneness* to attain life.\nHeaven and humanity employ the same mechanism—\nCreation’s work knows no difference.\nThus it is said: *Heaven and humanity act in unison*,\nFor this is to grasp the Dao’s mechanism.\nTo harmonize with Heaven,\nAll dusty entanglements cease within the heart.\nThus it is said: *All transformations rest upon a fixed foundation*.\n\nNature has skill and clumsiness—\nBoth can be concealed and hidden.\nCao Daochong says:\nNo skill surpasses Creation’s art,\nYet none know its purpose—\nIs this not like clumsiness?\nThe Classic says:\n*Nature has skill and clumsiness—*\n*Both can be concealed and hidden*.\n*Laozi* says:\n*The greatest skill appears clumsy*.\nThis meaning aligns with it.\n\nShi Zhenren says:\nOnly the Sage sets the mechanism in motion,\nAligned with Heaven’s Dao,\nAnd naturally all transformations rest within the heart’s foundation.\nThus, to exhaust principles and perfect nature,\nTo unite with the True Dao.\nHence:\n*Square yet not rigid, sharp yet not piercing;*\n*Straight yet not harsh, bright yet not dazzling;*\n*Without praise nor blame, without affirmation nor negation;*\n*One dragon, one serpent—transforming with the times;*\n*One ascends, one descends—harmony as measure.*\nMoving above all things,\nRoaming in the Dao’s realm,\nHow then could one be bound?\nIt is the return to the root, the restoration of essence.\nThus, *nature has skill and clumsiness—*\n*Both can be concealed and hidden*.\n\nZhongli Zhenren’s Ode:\nHeaven and humanity act in unison—\nThe heart’s foundation is fixed.\nRestore essence, return to root—\nPerfect nature in its time.\nConceal traces, hide brilliance—\nCultivate virtue and power.\nConceal the primal fire,\nGuard the yielding female.\n\nLü Zhenren’s *Wangjiangnan*:\nHeaven’s Dao is profound,\nCreation moves through the four seasons.\nSometimes leaping in the depths at the Month of Mao,\nOr safely withdrawn—\nThe autumn equinox’s omen is clear.\nThe celestial symbols are manifest.\nHumanity embodies this,\nActing in unison with Heaven’s stars.\nDaily life follows the hexagram’s lines,\nThe water clock’s markings—\nAll entanglements vanish,\nThe mind at rest.\n\nWhen the merit is complete, one ascends to Penglai.\nThe nine orifices’ evils lie in the three gates,\nWhich govern movement and stillness.\nGe Xianweng says:\n*The three gates are eye, ear, and mouth*.\nIf movement and stillness are not lost to their time,\nThe Dao shines bright.\nThus it is said:\n*What is not proper, do not gaze upon;*\n*What is not proper, do not listen to;*\n*What is not proper, do not speak of*.\n*The Five Thousand Words* say:\n*The five colors blind the eyes,*\n*The five sounds deafen the ears,*\n*The five flavors dull the tongue*.\nSight and hearing, speech—\nThese precede all human action.\nThus, among the nine orifices,\nThe three gates are paramount.\nThese three can nourish or harm humanity.\nNourishment comes from stillness,\nHarm from movement.\nMovement is human contrivance,\nStillness is Heaven’s essence.\nHuman contrivance is false,\nHeaven’s essence is true.\n\nZhang Zifang’s Ode:\nNine-orifice winds assail the upright spirit,\nThe three gates sealed—True Essence preserved.\nClarify the heart, dispel desires to seek profound truth,\nAwakening earnestness—no fixed path remains.\n\nGe Xianweng’s *Yujia’ao*:\nMysteries profound, profound yet deeper still,\nThe Sage’s laws descend to guide.\nEmbodying the Dao, observing Heaven—\nAll is revealed.\nMaster the three gates—\nHearing evil, do not let it intrude.\nSeal the *Dui* gate, guard the inner treasure,\nColors, sounds, and flavors—all understood.\nSight, hearing, speech all align with the Sage’s path,\nAbandon artifice,\nMove and rest with the times—then know what is good.\nFire arises from wood,\nDisaster strikes when it is checked.\nDelusion arises in the state,\nWhen its time comes, it collapses.\nTo know this and refine—\nThis is the Sage.\n\nShi Zhenren says:\nThe above speaks of the nine evils, the three gates,\nAnd the proper balance of movement and stillness—\nUrging caution, lest one fail to exhaust principles and perfect nature.\nThus, the analogy of fire and wood, delusion and state,\nIs raised again to earnestly urge refinement.\n\nHuman nature’s passions,\nLike fire within wood—\nEmerging from nature yet harming it,\nFire arising from wood yet destroying it.\nOnly the Sage comprehends the source of nature and life,\nClarifies Heaven and humanity’s Dao,\nExternally refines the form,\nInternally cultivates the nature.\nRefining the form preserves essence,\nCultivating the nature nourishes spirit.\nThus, the True Dao suffices to govern the body’s threads,\nSuffices to govern the state’s lands,\nSuffices to govern the world.\nThus, refining for oneself—\nIts virtue is true;\nRefining for the family—\nIts virtue is abundant;\nRefining for the world—\nIts virtue is enduring;\nRefining for the state—\nIts virtue is universal.\nFrom the inner to the outer,\nFrom the near to the far,\nCultivating this profound wind—\nIt reaches everywhere.\nThus it is said:\n*To know this and refine—*\n*This is the Sage*.\n\nCao Zhenren’s Ode:\nWood is true nature, fire is passion—\nWhen desire’s fire rages, it obstructs true nature.\nOnly the Sage, through refinement, attains this:\nThe state knows no peril, wood suffers no burning.\n\nXu Zhenren’s Ode:\nOn the day the Yellow Emperor attained the Dao,\nHe revealed the path to enlightenment.\nThe state’s wood is true nature,\nDelusion’s fire is evil passion.\nWhen passion vanishes, the fire is extinguished,\nWhen nature awakens, passion dies.\nIf the ruler refines earnestly,\nBody and state both rest in peace.\n\nGe Xianweng’s *Mantingfang*:\nWhen the heart stirs, the spirit grows weary;\nWhen passion clears, nature finds ease—\nThe wondrous gate opens, the mystic pass revealed.\nFire arises from wood—\nDisaster looms; investigate carefully.\nWater holds ice yet hinders water,\nFields store brambles yet obstruct the fields—\nProfound teachings are idle,\nEvil and true are but illusions,\nJoy comes from carefree observation.\nHeaven’s light reveals it:\nThe five aggregates—\nRefinement knows their end.\nWhat in the world is difficult to dispel?\nDemons vanish entirely,\nReturning to the origin, completing *Dui* to *Qian*.\nThe deed is done, cause and effect complete.\nSeeking Truth, the Three Thousand Practices fulfilled—\nDan is achieved, transcendence attained.\n\n*The Yellow Emperor’s Yinshu Jing Jijie* concludes.\n\n**The *Fuguo Anmin* Chapter of the Daoist Teachings:**\n\nZhongli Zhenren says:\n*\"Fuguo\"* (wealth of the realm) is the name for sufficiency;\n*\"Anmin\"* (peace of the people) means ease and tranquility.\nThe body is like a family and a state,\nThe heart compares to the sovereign and the father.\nWhen the sovereign upholds virtue, all under Heaven finds universal peace;\nWhen the heart remains still, all spirits within flourish abundantly.\n\nWithin one’s self, the vital essence suffices for all things,\nThe refined *qi* nourishes blood and vessels,\nThe organs, soul, and spirit—\nSkin, hair, and flesh—\nAre akin to the myriad commoners.\n\nWhen the ruler has no affairs, the people prosper in ease;\nWhen one knows contentment and forgets greed,\nThis is called *true wealth*.\nThus the *Daode Jing* states:\n*\"He who knows contentment is rich.\"*\n\nIt further asks:\n*\"To love the people and govern the state—\nCan one truly do without action?\"*\n\nAnd declares:\n*\"To act without action, then nothing remains untamed.\nI do without action, yet the people transform themselves;\nI love stillness, yet the people align with virtue;\nI have no desires, yet the people return to simplicity;\nI engage in no affairs, yet the people attain true wealth.*\nThis is the essence of the Dao for peace and prosperity.\"\n\nZhang Zifang’s hymn reads:\n*\"The lofty and mysterious Daoist realm is called the Jade Capital,\nA treasure without bounds within the *huqiu* (cauldron-vessel) of Heaven and Earth.\nTo observe contentment without effort is Heaven’s wealth,\nTo govern with clarity brings harmony and the state’s eternal peace.\"*\n\nShizhen Zhenren’s *Yutang Chun* states:\n*\"The gardens of Langyuan and Penglai,\nThe realms of Huaxu and all wondrous places,\nThe Jade Hall, the Golden Horse, and the precious city—\nThe commoners of Huaxian dwell in perfect peace.\nThis profound Dao resides within the body alone.\nThe body compares to a state, the heart to its sovereign.\"*\n\nThe reverent father’s heart upright and without deceit,\nSpirit serene and content, knowing sufficiency and forgetting greed—\nThis is called true abundance and prosperity,\nA spring within the cauldron-vessel yet unseen.\n\nLife and death by Heaven’s decree,\nThe Dao’s principle it is.\nThe Vermilion Pine Child spoke:\n*\"Heaven’s birth and death all align with Dao’s workings,\nNot arbitrary motion, but the Way’s own order.\"*\n\nIndeed, Heaven and Earth refine their essence into yin and yang,\nYin and yang condense their essence into the Four Seasons,\nThe Four Seasons disperse their essence into all things.\nHeaven possesses the *qi* of the Five Phases,\nFollowing the seasons, responding to commands,\nShifting in sequence as they unfold.\n\nIn spring and summer, the yang-harmonizing *qi* nurtures all things,\nIn autumn and winter, the yin-cooling *qi* prunes and slays all things—\nThese are the natural principles, the most equitable of Dharma.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Life and death by Heaven’s decree,\nThe Dao’s principle it is.\"*\n\nHeaven and Earth are thieves of all things,\nAll things are thieves of humankind,\nHumankind are thieves of all things.\nIf the three thievings are harmonized,\nThen the Three Powers are at peace.\n\nThe Azure Sea Crane said:\n*\"Heaven and Earth steal from all things to give them birth,\nYet do not know that Heaven and Earth are stolen from in return,\nAs all things age and decline.\nAll things serve humankind for clothing and use,\nYet do not know that they steal humankind’s pride and excess.\nHumankind use all things for tools and craft,\nYet do not know that they steal all things to ruin and decay.\"*\n\nThe Xu Zhenren said:\n*\"All things steal from Heaven and Earth to take form,\nYet do not know that Heaven and Earth steal from all things,\nCausing them to wither and grow old.\nHumankind steal from all things to gather wealth,\nYet do not know that all things steal from humankind,\nExhausting them with labor and bringing misfortune.\nIf one steals yet denies the Dao’s way,\nThis is not true thieving.\"*\n\nThe above three meanings,\nEach steals from the other in turn—\nThe natural principle it is.\nIf humankind exhaust the principle and grasp the truth,\nThey align with the Dao’s thieving,\nFollow what is fitting and find harmony,\nGo against the principle and meet disaster.\n\nThus the three thievings each find their fitting place,\nThe Three Powers all rest in their proper roles.\nHence it is said:\n*\"Eat in season, and the hundred bones are at ease,\nStir the mechanism, and the myriad transformations are harmonized.\"*\n\nThe Shizhen Zhenren said:\n*\"Hence it is said,\"—meaning the continuity of these truths.\nFirst, one must know Heaven and Earth’s principle of birth and death,\nThen understand the three thievings’ alignment with Dao’s workings,\nIf the three thievings each find their fitting place,\nAnd the Three Powers rest in their proper roles,\nThen eating in season brings ease to the hundred bones,\nAnd stirring the mechanism brings harmony to the myriad transformations.*\n\nThe Cao Daochong said:\n*\"All who seek to understand life and death must first eat and drink.\nThe Five Grains, Five Fruits, Five Flavors—\nAll must be seasoned and prepared appropriately,\nConsumed in measure, fitting the body’s needs.\nCooked, they nourish; raw, they harm the organs—\nThis is the principle of eating.\"*\n\nThus, if eating and drinking follow their proper times,\nAnd flavors accord with their due measures,\nOnly then does one stay within the Dao’s center,\nWithout exceeding its norms—\nThen the hundred bones are all in harmony,\nThe Five Organs are at peace,\nFree from all sickness,\nAnd longevity is extended.\n\nHence it is said:\n*\"Eat in season, and the hundred bones are at ease.\"*\n\nThe Zhang Zifang said:\n*\"All things that are foul in hue,\nAre not the true *qi* of harmony.\nThose foul in scent,\nAre not the true *qi* of balance.\nCooking that violates proper seasoning,\nIs not the fulfillment of Water and Fire’s work.\nWhat is produced out of season,\nIs not the complete essence of life’s *qi*.\"*\n\nThe Sage warns against these four transgressions,\nThus the *Inner Classic* states:\n*\"Eat and drink with moderation,\nRest and rise with regularity,\nDo not labor excessively or without purpose—\nThis is called knowing the Dao.\"*\n\nHence the virtuous person drinks the Heavenly Harmony to moisten the spirit,\nAnd eats the Earth’s Virtue to nourish the form.\n\nThe Cui Minggong said:\n*\"The *Dao Classic* speaks:\n'While all others possess it,\nI alone am dull and coarse,\nYet I alone differ from others,\nAnd value seeking food from the Mother.'\nThis is the profound meaning of eating in season.\"*\n\nEating in season brings ease to the hundred bones—\nThis is the application of the human Dao.\nStirring the mechanism brings harmony to the myriad transformations—\nThis is the essence of Heaven’s Dao.\n\nZhang Zifang’s hymn reads:\n*\"The three thievings in turn give and take,\nEating in season brings harmony to the hundred bones.\nGold and sand nourish the Five Organs like wind and rain,\nYet do not obstruct the Imperial House’s noble station.\"*\n\nThe Zhongli Zhenren’s *Manlu Hua* states:\n*\"All have the Dao within,\nYet the lost do not know its source.\nLife and death by Heaven’s decree,\nA marvel hidden in the mysterious pivot of the stars and constellations,\nThe shadow and movement shifting with each season.\nWith a tranquil heart, forgetting love and desire,\nAdjusting the spirit in proper sequence—\nAwakened wisdom, clear nature, the soul’s roundness.\nIf the Three Powers and the three thievings find their fitting place,\nThen wealth for the nation is no difficulty.\nEating in season brings ease to the hundred bones,\nRefining the elixir field.\nNo hindrance from the marketplace,\nNo obstruction in serving as court official.\nEndless as the embryo’s breath,\nThe *qi* nourishes the infant—\nLet the tortoise and hare go their way.\nHumankind know their spirit when it is active,\nYet do not know the spirit’s stillness,\nNor the source of its vitality.\"*\n\nThe Cui Minggong said:\n*\"To rely solely on cleverness brings failure,\nTo rely solely on dullness brings confusion.\nOne clear, one dim—\nThis is called yin and yang.\nOne yin, one yang—\nThe Dao’s principle it is.\"*\n\nThe Lü Zhenren said:\n*\"Commoners take thunderous might and dazzling display as spirit,\nThe Sage takes boundless void and quiet stillness as the Dao.\nThe Dao is spirit.\nYet when one encounters the awe of lightning and thunder,\nOr the fury of wind and rain,\nThe heart trembles in fear and calls it spirit—\nThey do not know that Heaven, Earth, and all things arise from this very void and stillness,\nThis is the spirit’s stillness,\nThe source of its vitality.\"*\n\nThe Zhongli said:\n*\"Spirit is subtle yet without form,\nThe unfathomable interplay of yin and yang.\nYet they know only that all things grow from yin and yang,\nAnd do not know that yin and yang themselves arise from the spirit’s stillness.\nThe spirit’s stillness is the ultimate Dao.\nVoid and stillness are the Way of non-action.\nThus it is called the spirit’s stillness.\nWithin this stillness, yin and yang, sun and moon, the Three Powers, and all things are born—\nThis is the spirit’s stillness,\nThe source of its vitality.\"*\n\nThe Zifang said:\n*\"The Dao is ever non-acting yet nothing remains undone,\nFor its non-action is the true Dao.\nThus boundless and dark,\nYet within it lies essence.\nFaint and indistinct,\nYet within it lies substance.\nThis is the ultimate Dao.\nWithin the spirit’s stillness lies the principle of the most profound spirit.\"*\n\nZhang Zifang’s hymn reads:\n*\"All know the spirit when it is active,\nYet the spirit flees and scatters like wind and cloud.\nThe spirit’s stillness brings natural transformation,\nProlonging life’s joy—\nOnly then does one know the Great Dao returns to its root.\"*\n\nThe **Master of Red Pine’s** *\"Little Chongshan\"* speaks:\n*\"Endless striving for profit and fame,\nExhausting ears and mind in vain pursuit—\nDraining vital essence, depleting *qi*, harming the original spirit,\nWhen the form and spirit are harmonized, wealth and life abandon none.\nThe Great Dao is vast and level,\nNon-action as its wondrous function—\nYet action brings delusion.\nWithin the dark void, the spirit’s essence hides;\nRemove the mysterious and obscure,\nOnly then does the radiant clarity appear.\n\nThe sun and moon have their measures,\nGreat and small have their fixed bounds.\nFrom this arises the Sage’s work,\nFrom this emerges divine luminosity.\"*\n\n**Zhongli** said:\n*\"The sun and moon are the essence of yin and yang,\nThe most exalted within the Six Directions.\nDays accumulate into months, months into years,\nCirculating through the celestial sphere, each with its degrees—\nRising and setting, great and small.\nThus it is that the sun and moon have their measures,\nAnd great and small have their fixed bounds.\"*\n\n**Master Lü** said:\n*\"The sun and moon push each other, and light is born;\nCold and heat push each other, and the year is complete.\nWith warmth and coolness, cold and heat,\nSpring, summer, autumn, and winter—\nThus Heaven and Earth nurture eternally.\nAll things are thereby created and born through this Dao.\nIs it not the Sage’s work and divine luminosity?\"*\n\n**Master Xu** said:\n*\"All things—whether born from egg, womb, moisture, or transformed into metal, stone, grass, or wood—\nThe principles by which Heaven and Earth nurture all things\nAll arise from the void to the manifest.\nThus the Sage’s work is manifest.\nAll things in the world receive this Sage’s work and are born.\nTherefore, great and small each have their fixed portion,\nNeither overstepping nor envying.\nThus the great does not despise the small,\nNor the small covet the great—\nHence the *Peng* and the *Yuan* each soar freely, unburdened by comparison.\"*\n\n**Master Liu Haichan** said:\n*\"What is seen is called *xiàng* [form],\nWhat is shaped is called *qi* [instrument].\nSpeaking of *xiàng*, it is the sun and moon;\nSpeaking of *qi*, it is great and small.\nOnly when there is *xiàng* does number arise—\nThus, the sun and moon have their measures;\nOnly when there is *qi* does position arise—\nThus, great and small have their fixed bounds.\nAs the most refined of the Three Powers,\nConforming to the proper rise and fall of yin and yang,\nThe sun and moon’s movements fulfill the Sage’s work,\nThe spirit ascends to the Great Void—\nCultivation and verification lie within humanity,\nHigh and low follow their course.\"*\n\n**Master Cao’s** hymn:\n*\"The sun and moon rise and set by measure,\nThe *Guan* and *Kun* shift by the *yao* [trigram].\nThe Sage’s work departs of its own accord,\nGreat and small each find their resting place.\nHan Xin crossed his thighs in humiliation,\nTao Qian bowed in shame at forced service.\nFloating vanity and pure simplicity—\nThe *Peng* and *Yuan* each soar freely.\"*\n\n**Master Zhang’s** hymn:\n*\"The boundless sky hides the sun and moon’s measure,\nThe *Kun* peaks first exchange their light.\nCreation depends on the *xian* [celestial string] for sight,\nThe divine function accumulates—endless and vast.\"*\n\n**Master Shi’s** *\"Mantingfang\"*:\n*\"True cinnabar, true sand—Heaven’s supreme treasure,\nMust be carefully nurtured and preserved.\nWhen the Five Phases are complete,\nThe *ying* and *zhi* intertwine.\nLeaning on the Three Heavens and Two Earths,\nYin and yang unite, the Nine and Six in one vessel.\nThe essence merges, warm and gentle in the crucible,\nDeep and flawless in its principle.\nHard and soft divide the *gua* [trigram] symbols,\nAdjusting the mediating fire’s timing,\nUsing expedient means to retain.\nWhen the Sage’s work is complete,\nThe nation prospers, the people thrive.\nThe *li* [hexagram] transforms from *Xu* to *Kan* to *Man*,\nPure yang returns—then there is a head.\nDivine luminosity emerges,\nHigh and low have their fixed ranks,\nFollowing the ranks of the immortals.\nIts mechanism is stolen—\nNone in the world can see it,\nNone can know it.\nThe gentleman who attains it preserves his life,\nThe petty man who attains it risks his fate.\"*\n\n**Master Xu** said:\n*\"This repeats the meaning of the three thieves from earlier.\nAll theft must align with the Dao;\nOne cannot steal against the Dao.\nHeaven has its seasons, Earth has its advantages.\nI ride the seasons and advantages of Heaven and Earth,\nMountains and marshes nurture me—\nTrees grow in my courtyard, like tilling fields.\nWho does not steal?\nYet people do not know the mechanism of theft.\nThe gentleman and petty man differ in their intentions—\nThe gentleman attains it and preserves his life,\nThe petty man attains it and risks his fate.\"*\n\n**Master Liu Haichan** said:\n*\"The gentleman knows that within the ultimate Dao lie all virtues.\nWhat he seeks is harmonious,\nWhat he practices is virtuous.\nAll his movements set virtuous mechanisms,\nAligned with the Dao’s patterns.\nThrough profound reflection and guarding the One,\nHe steals the subtle mysteries to nourish his nature,\nOr plunders the spirit’s waters, the *Yingzi* Pool’s jade essence,\nThe golden liquid of immortality.\nThe worthy gentleman knows this wondrous mechanism,\nThus it is said: *The gentleman attains it and preserves his life.*\nThe petty man, glimpsing its tricks,\nLights his fate—\nEver habituated to evil deeds,\nEver scheming with cunning,\nOnly seeking wealth and jade,\nUnmindful of toil.\nOr practicing martial arts—\nWould he shun fatigue?\nAdorning himself with clever schemes to survive in the world’s vanity,\nThus wars and poisons arise, armies perish,\nChasing nobility leads to disgrace,\nGreed harms oneself, lust brings calamity.\nThough they gain glory, they cannot escape blame.\nTruly, they do not know the Dao’s wondrous mechanism—\nThus it is said: *The petty man attains it and risks his fate.*\"*\n\n**Master Ge Xianweng** said:\n*\"The ultimate Dao is formless—\nThus none in the world can see it.\nIts wondrous mechanism is boundless—\nThus none in the world can know its principle.\nThe worthy attain it and preserve their life,\nThe unworthy are ruined by it—\nThus the petty man attains it and risks his fate.\"*\n\n**Master Ge Xianweng’s** hymn:\n*\"The worthy exhaust principles, merging with the void,\nAwakening to the *Guan* and *Kun*’s alchemical furnace.\nThe petty scholar only contends for name and gain—\nThe fields and graves are their destined path.\"*\n\n**Master Lü’s** *\"Xingxiangzi\"*:\n*\"The wondrous Dao is profound and subtle,\nFew can attain it—\nEven the brightest minds find it hard to see or know.\nDark and obscure, the sovereign’s essence,\nFaint and indistinct, its form.\nIt hides true essence, conceals its symbols,\nCalled the Heavenly mechanism.\nThe worthy exhaust principles,\nSecretly guarding the Three Wonders,\nWhile the foolish chase illusions, lost in delusion.\nGreedy for wealth and lust,\nTheir actions are not virtuous.\nThey squander their spirit lightly,\nTheir life and fate—\nFoolishly applied.\"*\n\n**The True Person’s** *\"Su Zhongqing\"*:\n*\"The noble gentleman’s nature is peaceful,\nNot contending with things.\"*\n\n*\"Only the foolish and unknowing,\nVying for hollow fame in the snail’s horn.\nThe profound and wondrous principle,\nRecorded in the True Scripture,\nBrings wealth and secures the people.*\n\n*Dark and obscure, the sovereign’s essence,\nFaintly and deeply concealed,\nThose who awaken—Daos born.*\n\n**The Yellow Emperor’s *Yinshu Jing* (Collected Commentaries, Middle and Lower Volumes):**\n*The Yellow Emperor, Red Pine Child, Zhang Liang the True Person,\nThe Left Daoist of the Great Extremes, Terence Kang,\nThe True Person of Western Mountain, Zhongli Quan the True Person of Rectified Yang,\nLü Yan the True Person of Pure Yang, the True Person of Hua yang,\nShi Jianwu, Cui Minggong the True Person of Ultimate Unity,\nLiu Xuanying the True Person of the Sea Tortoise,\nCao Daochong the True Person of Clear and Empty.*\n\n**Chapter on *Qiangbing* (Strong Arms) and *Yanshu* (Victorious Arts):**\n*Zhongli the True Person said:*\n*'Strong' refers to vigor and health;\n*'Arms' denotes the tools for warding off barbarians.*\n\n*The *De Jing* states:*\n*'To nurture life is auspicious;\nTo direct *qi* with the heart is strength.'*\n*The *I Ching* declares:*\n*'The movements of Heaven are vigorous—\nThe noble gentleman strengthens himself and never rests.'*\n\n*This speaks of embodying Heaven’s pure yang virtue,\nCommanding all living beings,\nWith the heart as sovereign and *qi* as the army—\nThe ruler acts without action,\nAnd all is governed.\nThis is the Dao of serene stillness and non-action.*\n\n*To subdue demons with the Dao,\nNone shall fail.*\n\n*Thus it is said:*\n*'Strong arms, victorious arts.'*\n\n**Master Lü’s** words:\n*'The Sage establishes laws,\nIntending only to suppress evil and restore order,\nTo govern the state and bring peace to the people.\nHow could it be for scheming with stratagems,\nDiscussing martial arts and raising armies,\nDriving living beings to toil,\nSlaughtering lives and gathering misfortune,\nAccumulating sins and bringing calamity to descendants?\nEven as Sun, Wu, Han, and Bai\nEmployed cunning and deceitful schemes,\nTheir bones became hills, their blood rivers,\nLeaving all living beings in endless suffering,\nAnd rulers with countless worries—\nCould this be called great merit or broad vision?\nHence the *Five Thousand Words* says:*\n*\"To govern with wisdom is the thief of the state;\nNot to govern with wisdom is the state’s blessing.\"*\n*And again:*\n*\"Fine arms are not auspicious instruments.\"*\n\n*Therefore, the *Yinshu* places this in the lower section.*\n\n**Master Shi’s** praise:\n*\"To act well without trace is called strong arms;\nTo repel invaders and dispel barbarians is the essence of arms.\nTo forget the self when facing adversity is victory;\nThus, how should one cultivate and govern to secure peace and honor?\"*\n\n**Master Cao’s** *\"Qingxiao Yue\"*:\n*\"The heart as sovereign, *qi* as general—\nThe army of kindness as banners, wisdom as encampments.\nDiscipline and rhythm set the plans,\nRighteousness and benevolence as armor—\nFrugality and reverence as provisions,\nVirtue ensuring tranquility.\nTemperate and loyal, modest and cautious,\nOrders march with trust and integrity.\nFilial piety and harmony array the ranks,\nThe demonic forces surrender at a single strike.*\n\n*The blind excel in hearing,\nThe deaf excel in sight.\nCutting off profit at its source,\nDeploy tenfold armies;\nRepeating reflection day and night,\nDeploy ten thousandfold armies.*\n\n**Cui Minggong said:**\n*'The blind hear and the deaf see—\nThis is due to their singular focus,\nThus they are called skilled.*\n*But if one can concentrate with unwavering sincerity,\nAnd act with precise timing,\nAll endeavors shall be fully rewarded.\nMoreover, if one can ponder deeply,\nReflecting day and night,\nThe benefits gained exceed ordinary wisdom ten thousandfold.'\"\n\n「The Master Cui Minggong said: The Way/Teacher, is the heart. All actions and movements arise from the heart; when the spirit and heart are concentrated in singularity, nothing fails to be accomplished.\n\nThe Master Hai Manzi praised:\n*The blind hear, the deaf observe—only through utmost sincerity,\nCutting off profit at its source, the sage’s emotions remain pure.\nDeploying armies day and night, with threefold reflection,\nQi and blood merge, and the elixir forms naturally.*\n\nThe Sage Cao Zhenren sang in *Su Mu Zhe*:\n*\"The blind dispel darkness, the deaf extinguish sound,\nCutting off profit, armies move with tenfold efficacy.\nA myriad of laws do not stray from the mind’s measure,\nGuarding the celestial harmony with care,\nThis is the way to cultivate True Essence.*\n\n*Only with a vacant heart does the spirit settle,\nWithin emptiness and stillness, Dao/Way and qi return to their proper order.\nThreefold reflection and clarity of timing—first attend to the root,\nQi and blood merge, and the elixir depends on lead and mercury.*\n\n*The heart arises from things, yet perishes through things—its opportunity lies in the eyes.\nZhang Zifang said:\n*The critical moment of life and death lies in things,\nThe fate of success and failure is seen in the eyes.*\n\nThe Sage Xu Zhenren said:\n*Men of virtue/Way do not let the heart arise in vain,\nNor do they let opportunity move without cause.\nThe vulgar and ignorant covet all things to enrich themselves,\nYet are plundered by them, harming their true nature—\nThis is how the heart arises from things and perishes through things.*\n\nThe Old Sage Ge Xianweng said:\n*Knowing contentment brings no shame,\nKnowing restraint brings no peril—\nThus one may endure long.*\n\nThe ignorant stir the heart with false desires,\nAdding to the allure of myriad things;\nAll because the eyes perceive, and the heart responds—\nHence it is said: opportunity lies in the eyes.*\n\nThe Master Cui Minggong said:\n*Those whose opportunity lies in the eyes must guard their vision,\nLest they gaze upon what should not be seen.*\n\nThus the *Taoist Canon* states:\n*\"Seeing no desirable sights,\nThe heart remains undisturbed—this is the way.\"*\n\nZhang Zifang praised:\n*The heart, ensnared by the spectacle of myriad things,\nIs tormented by the flames of greed for wealth and honor.\nWhen the heart’s master is lost in obscurity, yet spirit does not scatter,\nNaturally the Dao/Way’s essence aligns with the Primordial.*\n\nCui Minggong sang in *Lin Jiang Xian*:\n*The heart stirs from the sight of things,\nForgotten is the opportunity—all illusions vanish.*\n\nThe scriptures say: *Close the mouth of the senses and seal its gate.*\nThe words of the sages are profound and wondrous,\nThose who understand will extend their years.\n\nIn our family’s Dao/Way, those who know it\nCherish their households, secure their nations, and cultivate their bodies.\nWith calm and steady refinement, they guard the spirit’s essence.\nAwakening to the opportunity in the eyes,\nBoth heart and vision become clear.\n\nThe heavens bestow no favor, yet great virtue/Way arises from it.*\n\nZhang Zifang said: *The heavens have no heart yet bestow virtue/Way upon all things,\nAll things have hearts yet return virtue/Way to the heavens.*\nThus the *Five Thousand Words* [of the Daoist Canon] states:\n*The heavens and earth are not virtuous/ren, treating all things as fodder for horses and dogs;\nThe sage is not virtuous/ren, treating the people as fodder for horses and dogs.*\nTo give without demanding repayment,\nTo nurture without claiming credit for deeds.\n\nXu Zhenren said: *To lack a heart is called lacking virtue/Way,\nYet when one abides in purity and stillness, things cannot deceive them—then virtue/Way of the heavens arises.*\nZhang Zifang’s ode declares:\n*The heavens’ qi lacks virtue/Way yet transforms and gives birth,\nThe Three Fields [of the body] retain the alchemy of changing into priceless treasures.*\nYin and yang fermented, ascending to the elixir of immortality—\nThis is how virtue/Way arises from lack, generating great virtue/Way.\n\nGe Xianhuang’s *Western River Moon* [song] states:\n*Preserve the Original Heavenly Truth without artifice,\nLacking a heart is the same as lacking virtue/Way.*\nFollow the natural process, refining and shaping into form,\nReturn to the root, the source is self.\nIn desire, virtue/Way lacks yet transforms—\nThe Three Fields change into priceless treasures.\nHow does virtue/Way arise from lack to become great?\nA single grain of elixir ensures eternal life.\n\nSwift thunder and fierce winds—\nNone fail to tremble in awe.\nZhang Zifang said: *Swift thunder and fierce winds,\nTheir might extends far yet their terror is near—all things tremble and fear them.*\nThe heavens originally do not threaten things yet are themselves feared,\nAnd all under heaven submit as they do to the sage.\n\nIn bestowing rewards, there is virtue/Way without demand;\nIn inflicting punishments, there is might without blame.\nRewards and punishments are established by the ruler,\nVirtue/Way and might are naturally followed below.\n\nXu Zhenren said: *When thunder shakes the earth,\nThe virtuous one uses fear to reflect and correct;\nWhen winds blow gently,\nThe virtuous one applies the mandate and acts accordingly.*\nShi Zhenren said: *As for military campaigns,\nIf the ruler can thus command awe above and fear below,\nSurely they will be able to pacify chaos and eliminate evil.*\nThus it is said: *There exists a strategy below to subdue strong armies with victory.*\nChi Songzi’s ode proclaims:\n*Winds and thunder stir the times as they come,\nCreation races onward, giving birth to all things.*\nIf military orders are trusted and executed according to law,\nThen tyrants and violence are cut down, securing peace.\n\nCao Zhenren’s *White Crane Child* [text] states:\n*At times, the wind serves as the chariot’s reins,\nThe thunderwheel drives all forward.*\nProclaiming the heavens’ commands,\nA grand spectacle of the two spirits’ might.\nShaking the depths of the earth’s veins,\nStartling the valleys back to spring.\nWhen will you employ might and virtue/Way?\nWith a single technique, the borders will be stilled.*\n\nThe utmost joy is the overflow of nature,\nThe utmost stillness brings purity.\nZhang Zifang said: *Awareness lies in the eyes.*\nChi Songzi said: *Nature, this is the yin.*\nJoy leads to excess and yin flourishes,\nStillness brings rectitude and the spirit clears.\n\nGe Xianweng said: *The sage does not indulge in utmost joy yet cherishes utmost stillness.\nThose who dwell the spirit between stillness and joy are called Guarding the Middle.*\nThus, advantages and power cannot seduce,\nSounds and colors cannot sway,\nPersuasive speakers cannot convince,\nThe wise cannot move,\nThe brave cannot intimidate.\nSeeing blessings beyond the heavy gates,\nAnticipating calamities within the unseen depths—\nEven the heavens will not oppose them,\nHow much more so the deceitful strategies of war?\n\nShi Zhenren’s ode states:\n*Utmost joy cannot compare to utmost stillness of heart,\nFree from dust and impurity, abandoning excess.*\nWhen deeds are fulfilled and the Dao/Way is complete, the elixir is ready—\nThen the intent of *Yin Symbols* [Yin Fu] is revealed.\nIts meaning is profound.\n\nLu Zhenren’s *Suzu Mu Zhe* [song] states:\n*Guard the void and softness,\nNurture the true nature,\nNourish the yang spirit—\nRetreat lies in the heart’s stillness.*\nWhen the vast qi harmonizes and the spirit is refined, one attains sainthood.\nUsing the Dao/Way to eliminate evil,\nAll illusions vanish.\nThis is the art of war—\nThe yin spirit perishes,\nThe formations of virtue/Way and compassion arise—\nGoing forth brings victory, returning ensures safety.\nNot like the common folk using tricks for fortune,\nLuring calamity and inviting retribution to harm innocent lives.\n\nThe heavens’ utmost secrecy,\nUsed with utmost fairness.\n\nThe Master Zhang [Zhang Liang] said:\nWhen the heavens and earth are in a state of *yun-yun* [氤氲], this is the utmost *private*—\nYet all things transform and take form, this is the utmost *public*.\n\nMaster Lü [Lü Dongbin] said:\nWhen the Dao/Way exists beneath the heavens, it is first called the \"mother of the heavens and earth\"—this is the utmost *private*.\nYet once one obtains this mother, one knows its offspring;\nOnce one knows its offspring, one returns to guard the mother—this is the utmost *public*.\n\nMaster Chi Songzi [赤松子] said:\nThe heavens and earth give birth to all things,\nYet all things bear *yin*—this is the utmost *private*;\nYet they embrace *yang*—this is the utmost *public*.\n\nThose who understand the Dao/Way of *public* and *private* shall know the workings of the numinous.\n\nMaster Zhongli [Zhongli Quan] extolled:\nThe heavens and earth in *yun-yun* are like the utmost *private*,\nYet in giving birth without possession lies the utmost *public* moment.\nUsed with utmost *public* like the south and north,\nDeployed with numinous sanctity like the east and west.\n\nMaster Lü’s *Wang Jiang Nan* [望江南] states:\nThe Great Dao/Way—all things are made manifest.\nWith use, there is no use;\nWithin non-action, divine function resides.\nAscending and descending know no end.\nThe Mysterious and the Feminine—\nCreation unites with the True Void.\nWhen the heavens and earth unite, sweet dew descends,\nThe mechanisms of the Dao—hidden and revealed—like *private* and *public*.\nReturning and reverting is the way of homage.\nThe rule of *qi* lies in the creatures.\n\nMaster Cao [Cao Guojiu] said:\nThe void transforms into the numinous,\nThe numinous transforms into *qi*.\nWhen *qi* is strong, it rules over things,\nYet when weak, it is ruled by things—\nThus it is said: *The rule of creatures lies in qi.*\n\nMaster Xu [Xu Xun] said:\nEven birds can ride upon the regulated *qi* of purity and voidness,\nTheir hearts move, their wings beat—\nSoaring between the clouds and the heavens,\nAbove and below all centered within themselves.\nHow much more so for humans, the most refined yet unrefined?\n\nIf one can skillfully employ the *qi* of the Dao/Way’s natural virtue/power,\nThen preserving one’s life to attain longevity is no great difficulty.\n\nMaster Shi [Shi Chunting] said:\n*Qi* is the origin of life.\nThose who skillfully gather and nourish *qi*\nCan even overcome the mightiest of oxen and tigers,\nThe strongest of armor and weapons—\nWhat then of lesser things?\n\nMaster Hai Chanzi [Hai Chanzi] extolled:\nTo rule over creatures, first subdue the tiger and dragon,\nThen all things naturally follow.\nThe Master’s precepts and the art of communion with spirits—\nGrasping *yin* and *yang*, mastering the center.\nMaster Cui [Cui]’s *Man Ting Fang* [满庭芳] states:\nThe soul wanders east and west,\nThe spirit moves south and north—\nWithin this lies another layer of profound mystery.\nThe Dao/Way has no form or trace;\nIts subtle words are divided and refined.\nBlood is like cinnabar,\nMercury is the precious essence—\nThe spirit of things is like silver and lead.\nIn the central palace, they are joined and matched in loving union.\nKunlun’s jade communicates with the Azure Sea—first refined.\nHaving returned to the origin and essence,\nThe Pearl of Foolishness and the Nine-Twisted Ant can pierce through.\nHarvesting the marrow of the Moon Rabbit,\nWith the Master’s craft—\nMixing the black liver of the crow.\nAt the moment of ruling over creatures,\nThirty-six transformations complete,\nAscending to the Penglai Mountains.\n\nLife is the root of death;\nDeath is the root of life.\n\n「Master Cao [Zhenren] said: Those who seek life must first cultivate it and then face death;\nThose who practice death must first embrace death and then attain life.\n\nMaster Zhang [Zifang] said: Those who seek life are ensnared by the sights and sounds of the world,\nWeary their spirit and exhaust their qi,\nGreedily pursue honor and wealth,\nWhile the fires of desire consume them—\nMisfortune and calamity follow in their wake;\nWhy delay death?\n\nThose who practice death dwell in a murky void of ignorance,\nTheir spirit serene and unattached,\nTheir qi tranquil and without purpose.\nA thousand worries fail to move them,\nAnd seeking death, they cannot find it—\nFor the path to eternal life lies here.\n\nMaster Ge [Xianweng] extolled:\nFew know the Gate of Life and the Door of Death,\nYet their operation lies within the trigrams **Kàn** and **Lí**.\nWhen the two **Bā** are consumed, the yang qi grows strong;\nAt the three **Yīn** and three **Yáng**, the essence is refined.\nMaster Zhang [Zifang]’s *White Crane’s Son* states:\nIf one seeks the Dao/Way of immortality,\nFirst, one must recognize the primordial root.\n\nFor the mind gives rise to scattered spirit,\nAnd when the worldly attachments vanish, wisdom returns clear.\nThe heavens and earth serve as crucible and furnace,\nWhile yin and yang act as fuel and flame.\nRefined into the supreme elixir,\nThe work complete—one departs to meet the True.\n\nVirtue/power born of harm,\nHarm born of virtue/power.\n\nMaster Zhōnglí [Zhenren] said:\nVirtue/power is the source of harm,\nHarm is the current of virtue/power.\n\nMaster Lǚ [Zhenren] said:\nThe fundamental cause is virtue/power born of qi,\nYet failing to preserve the innate purity—\nDrifting in the river of love,\nCarried by the tides of desire—\nThis is virtue/power yielding harm,\nHarm arising from virtue/power.\n\nMaster Xǔ [Zhenren] extolled:\nVirtue/power born of qi has no intrinsic origin,\nYet harm arises when virtue/power is applied without reason.\nGuarding the beginning with diligence,\nRefining the elixir to perfection—\nEven spirits are astonished.\nMaster Chìsōngzǐ’s *Lín Jiāng Xiān* states:\nTo return with sincerity is to love the spring,\nYet to cling endlessly is to recognize this as virtue/power.\nWho knows that harm still grows within virtue/power?\nWhen desire fades, virtue/power naturally perishes,\nAnd with virtue/power gone, harm has no foundation.\nOffspring stems from virtue/power’s cause,\nYet excessive virtue/power harms one’s form.\nThose who refine virtue/power’s qi nurture a precious treasure—\nThirty-six transformations fulfilled,\nPaying homage to the Jade Sovereign’s Cup.\n\nThe foolish see the heavens and earth’s patterns as sacred teachings,\nI see the world’s timely shifts as wise revelations.\nMaster Zhang [Zifang] said:\nCelestial patterns are the sun, moon, stars, and constellations—\nLightning, rain, wind, and clouds.\nEarthly patterns are mountains, seas, metals, and stones—\nGrasses, trees, scales, and feathers.\nThe foolish delight in auspicious stars, clouds of blessing,\nPure winds and sweet dews,\nOr drink from the wine-springs and feast on rare grains,\nOr behold the phoenix, deer, and immortal fungi—\nAll these they take as joy.\nYet when they see eclipses,\nSeasons out of order,\nOminous comets and pestilential vapors,\nFloods and droughts, locust plagues,\nSudden rains and violent winds,\nHeavens dark and earth trembling—\nThey are seized with fear,\nDreading calamity may strike them.\nObserving these celestial and terrestrial patterns,\nThey believe them to be lessons of caution,\nWarnings to reflect and refine—\nThus, they ascend from the common to the sage,\nAnd are called the *Patterned Sage*.\n\nMaster Liǔ Hǎichán said:\nAs the Yellow Emperor [Huangdi] composed the *Yīn Fú* [Scripture],\nHe first raised the foolish who saw the heavens and earth’s patterns as sacred teachings,\nThen humbly declared: “I see the world’s timely shifts as wise revelations,\nMeaning that what follows comes first.”\n\nMaster Xǔ [Zhenren] said:\nThe *Patterned Sage* of timely shifts refers to human affairs—\nOne need not gaze upon celestial omens,\nBut must always follow the Dao/Way in harmony with the times,\nAnd even if disasters arise, they will not harm.\n\nMaster Chìsōngzǐ said:\nOrder belongs to the virtuous,\nChaos to the unworthy.\nEmbodying the heavens and conforming to the Dao/Way,\nAdjusting to the seasons and aligning with the times—\nWith this refined understanding,\nAll worldly dualities dissolve into pure yang,\nAnd the True Dao/Way is complete.\n\nMaster Zhōnglí [Zhenren] extolled:\nThough celestial omens are lofty and profound,\nThey reveal auspicious and inauspicious signs—\nEven the foolish, when enlightened,\nReflect and refine with diligence,\nAnd thus have no cause for worry.\nFortune and misfortune are self-summoned,\nYet by observing the world’s shifts,\nOne discerns the rise and fall of all things.\nSeizing the moment with virtue/power,\nAnd always acting with benevolence—\nCalamities and misfortunes are forever banished.\n\nThe *Yīn Fú* [Scripture]’s meaning is simple yet profound,\nIts words subtle, its essence dense—\nIt guides the lost and enlightens the ignorant.\nIts radiant light spreads far,\nIlluminating the darkest paths.\nHolding fast to the One, the elixir is perfected—\nThe realm grows rich, the people secure and tranquil,\nThe spirits rejoice in purity.\nStrengthened armies prevail,\nPure yang refined—\nOne strides into the Mysterious Metropolis [Xuan Du].\nThe *Yīn Fú* [Scripture] of the Yellow Emperor concludes.」",

is the Sage.\n\nShi Zhenren says:\nThe above speaks of the nine evils, the three gates,\nAnd the proper balance of movement and stillness—\nUrging caution, lest one fail to exhaust principles and perfect nature.\nThus, the analogy of fire and wood, delusion and state,\nIs raised again to earnestly urge refinement.\n\nHuman nature’s passions,\nLike fire within wood—\nEmerging from nature yet harming it,\nFire arising from wood yet destroying it.\nOnly the Sage comprehends the source of nature and life,\nClarifies Heaven and humanity’s Dao,\nExternally refines the form,\nInternally cultivates the nature.\nRefining the form preserves essence,\nCultivating the nature nourishes spirit.\nThus, the True Dao suffices to govern the body’s threads,\nSuffices to govern the state’s lands,\nSuffices to govern the world.\nThus, refining for oneself—\nIts virtue is true;\nRefining for the family—\nIts virtue is abundant;\nRefining for the world—\nIts virtue is enduring;\nRefining for the state—\nIts virtue is universal.\nFrom the inner to the outer,\nFrom the near to the far,\nCultivating this profound wind—\nIt reaches everywhere.\nThus it is said:\n*To know this and refine—*\n*This is the Sage*.\n\nCao Zhenren’s Ode:\nWood is true nature, fire is passion—\nWhen desire’s fire rages, it obstructs true nature.\nOnly the Sage, through refinement, attains this:\nThe state knows no peril, wood suffers no burning.\n\nXu Zhenren’s Ode:\nOn the day the Yellow Emperor attained the Dao,\nHe revealed the path to enlightenment.\nThe state’s wood is true nature,\nDelusion’s fire is evil passion.\nWhen passion vanishes, the fire is extinguished,\nWhen nature awakens, passion dies.\nIf the ruler refines earnestly,\nBody and state both rest in peace.\n\nGe Xianweng’s *Mantingfang*:\nWhen the heart stirs, the spirit grows weary;\nWhen passion clears, nature finds ease—\nThe wondrous gate opens, the mystic pass revealed.\nFire arises from wood—\nDisaster looms; investigate carefully.\nWater holds ice yet hinders water,\nFields store brambles yet obstruct the fields—\nProfound teachings are idle,\nEvil and true are but illusions,\nJoy comes from carefree observation.\nHeaven’s light reveals it:\nThe five aggregates—\nRefinement knows their end.\nWhat in the world is difficult to dispel?\nDemons vanish entirely,\nReturning to the origin, completing *Dui* to *Qian*.\nThe deed is done, cause and effect complete.\nSeeking Truth, the Three Thousand Practices fulfilled—\nDan is achieved, transcendence attained.\n\n*The Yellow Emperor’s Yinshu Jing Jijie* concludes.",

      "translated_text": "「Master Cao [Zhenren] said: Those who seek life must first cultivate it and then face death;\nThose who practice death must first embrace death and then attain life.\n\nMaster Zhang [Zifang] said: Those who seek life are ensnared by the sights and sounds of the world,\nWeary their spirit and exhaust their qi,\nGreedily pursue honor and wealth,\nWhile the fires of desire consume them—\nMisfortune and calamity follow in their wake;\nWhy delay death?\n\nThose who practice death dwell in a murky void of ignorance,\nTheir spirit serene and unattached,\nTheir qi tranquil and without purpose.\nA thousand worries fail to move them,\nAnd seeking death, they cannot find it—\nFor the path to eternal life lies here.\n\nMaster Ge [Xianweng] extolled:\nFew know the Gate of Life and the Door of Death,\nYet their operation lies within the trigrams **Kàn** and **Lí**.\nWhen the two **Bā** are consumed, the yang qi grows strong;\nAt the three **Yīn** and three **Yáng**, the essence is refined.\nMaster Zhang [Zifang]’s *White Crane’s Son* states:\nIf one seeks the Dao/Way of immortality,\nFirst, one must recognize the primordial root.\n\nFor the mind gives rise to scattered spirit,\nAnd when the worldly attachments vanish, wisdom returns clear.\nThe heavens and earth serve as crucible and furnace,\nWhile yin and yang act as fuel and flame.\nRefined into the supreme elixir,\nThe work complete—one departs to meet the True.\n\nVirtue/power born of harm,\nHarm born of virtue/power.\n\nMaster Zhōnglí [Zhenren] said:\nVirtue/power is the source of harm,\nHarm is the current of virtue/power.\n\nMaster Lǚ [Zhenren] said:\nThe fundamental cause is virtue/power born of qi,\nYet failing to preserve the innate purity—\nDrifting in the river of love,\nCarried by the tides of desire—\nThis is virtue/power yielding harm,\nHarm arising from virtue/power.\n\nMaster Xǔ [Zhenren] extolled:\nVirtue/power born of qi has no intrinsic origin,\nYet harm arises when virtue/power is applied without reason.\nGuarding the beginning with diligence,\nRefining the elixir to perfection—\nEven spirits are astonished.\nMaster Chìsōngzǐ’s *Lín Jiāng Xiān* states:\nTo return with sincerity is to love the spring,\nYet to cling endlessly is to recognize this as virtue/power.\nWho knows that harm still grows within virtue/power?\nWhen desire fades, virtue/power naturally perishes,\nAnd with virtue/power gone, harm has no foundation.\nOffspring stems from virtue/power’s cause,\nYet excessive virtue/power harms one’s form.\nThose who refine virtue/power’s qi nurture a precious treasure—\nThirty-six transformations fulfilled,\nPaying homage to the Jade Sovereign’s Cup.\n\nThe foolish see the heavens and earth’s patterns as sacred teachings,\nI see the world’s timely shifts as wise revelations.\nMaster Zhang [Zifang] said:\nCelestial patterns are the sun, moon, stars, and constellations—\nLightning, rain, wind, and clouds.\nEarthly patterns are mountains, seas, metals, and stones—\nGrasses, trees, scales, and feathers.\nThe foolish delight in auspicious stars, clouds of blessing,\nPure winds and sweet dews,\nOr drink from the wine-springs and feast on rare grains,\nOr behold the phoenix, deer, and immortal fungi—\nAll these they take as joy.\nYet when they see eclipses,\nSeasons out of order,\nOminous comets and pestilential vapors,\nFloods and droughts, locust plagues,\nSudden rains and violent winds,\nHeavens dark and earth trembling—\nThey are seized with fear,\nDreading calamity may strike them.\nObserving these celestial and terrestrial patterns,\nThey believe them to be lessons of caution,\nWarnings to reflect and refine—\nThus, they ascend from the common to the sage,\nAnd are called the *Patterned Sage*.\n\nMaster Liǔ Hǎichán said:\nAs the Yellow Emperor [Huangdi] composed the *Yīn Fú* [Scripture],\nHe first raised the foolish who saw the heavens and earth’s patterns as sacred teachings,\nThen humbly declared: “I see the world’s timely shifts as wise revelations,\nMeaning that what follows comes first.”\n\nMaster Xǔ [Zhenren] said:\nThe *Patterned Sage* of timely shifts refers to human affairs—\nOne need not gaze upon celestial omens,\nBut must always follow the Dao/Way in harmony with the times,\nAnd even if disasters arise, they will not harm.\n\nMaster Chìsōngzǐ said:\nOrder belongs to the virtuous,\nChaos to the unworthy.\nEmbodying the heavens and conforming to the Dao/Way,\nAdjusting to the seasons and aligning with the times—\nWith this refined understanding,\nAll worldly dualities dissolve into pure yang,\nAnd the True Dao/Way is complete.\n\nMaster Zhōnglí [Zhenren] extolled:\nThough celestial omens are lofty and profound,\nThey reveal auspicious and inauspicious signs—\nEven the foolish, when enlightened,\nReflect and refine with diligence,\nAnd thus have no cause for worry.\nFortune and misfortune are self-summoned,\nYet by observing the world’s shifts,\nOne discerns the rise and fall of all things.\nSeizing the moment with virtue/power,\nAnd always acting with benevolence—\nCalamities and misfortunes are forever banished.\n\nThe *Yīn Fú* [Scripture]’s meaning is simple yet profound,\nIts words subtle, its essence dense—\nIt guides the lost and enlightens the ignorant.\nIts radiant light spreads far,\nIlluminating the darkest paths.\nHolding fast to the One, the elixir is perfected—\nThe realm grows rich, the people secure and tranquil,\nThe spirits rejoice in purity.\nStrengthened armies prevail,\nPure yang refined—\nOne strides into the Mysterious Metropolis [Xuan Du].\nThe *Yīn Fú* [Scripture] of the Yellow Emperor concludes.」",
