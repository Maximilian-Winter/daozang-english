  "full_translation": "**The Immortal Register of Qingwei**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Immortal Register of Qingwei*. Transmitted by Huang Shunshen of the Yuan, compiled by Chen Cai. One fascicle. Source text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, section *Dongzhen*, category *Xielu*.\n\n**Preface to The Immortal Register of Qingwei**\n\nThe Dao exists prior to the Great Ultimate—what does this mean? Before Heaven and Earth arose, the Great Ultimate already was. Could anything precede it? As the scriptures say: \"The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth.\" If this is the origin, then does it not exist before Heaven and Earth?\n\nNow, Heaven’s movements—sun and moon in their courses, wind and rain in their dispersal and nourishment, thunder and lightning in their stirring—are known as Heaven’s transformations, yet none recognize them as the workings of the Dao. Alas! Were the Dao’s workings to cease for even a single breath, Heaven’s transformations would halt.\n\nDoes not the *Book of Changes* say: \"Great indeed is the Qian’s primordial power! All things owe their beginning to it, and it governs Heaven.\" It also states: \"That which precedes Heaven—Heaven does not oppose it.\" If even Heaven does not oppose it, how much less would humans, how much less spirits and gods?\n\nThus, the Dao’s mysteries, from the outset, could not remain untransmitted. Its transmission began with the Primordial Beginning, then divided into the Jade Dawn and the Lord Lao. Through further divisions, it branched into the four lineages of Zhenyuan, Taihua, Guanling, and Zhengyi. After ten transmissions, it reached the Ancestral Perfected Sovereign Zhao Ning, where it once more unified.\n\nEight transmissions later, it came to the Perfected of Hidden Chaos, Master Nan. Master Nan’s learning encompassed Heaven and humanity; he served the Song as a high official. Encountering the Perfected of Preserving Unity, he received the Supreme Dao, thereafter commanding spirits and gods, summoning thunder and rain, moving celestial envoys, and ascending to the Immortal Bureaus.\n\nIn his later years, he met Master Huang of Thunder’s Tribulation, marveled at him, and transmitted all his writings. Master Huang pondered deeply, composed works, and expounded the lineage’s principles, thereby completing the corpus.\n\nIn all prayers and invocations, he could, as if holding a sure pledge, achieve results without effort or display, exacting recompense from the vast and empty void with unerring precision—how divine! At that time, princes and nobles vied to enlist him, and disciples from all directions numbered in the thousands.\n\nSome glimpsed a fragment, others plagiarized half a method; when hastily tested, none failed to yield results.\n\nYet Master Huang treasured his writings, disdaining to impart them to others, so though scholars thronged in great numbers, few beheld the full arcana. Recently, summoned by imperial decree to court, he received leave to return to the mountains, and only then did I gain admittance to his gate. In moments of leisure, we would converse at ease, and whenever we discussed the subtleties of the Dao, he would press the matter again and again. Though I was the last to encounter the Master, I received his teachings most profoundly. One day, he said to me: “I am old now, and have seen many people, yet none has grasped the essence in silence, heart communicating with heart, steadfast in faith and resolute in practice, as you have. This must be heaven’s gift, not man’s doing.” Thereupon, he brought forth all the writings he had received from Master Nan and bestowed them upon me.\n\nOn the day I bowed to receive them, I secretly vowed: “Though I entered the Master’s gate late, I have been able to refine myself through his teachings, and now I have also obtained his writings. How dare I not spread their transmission, that in a thousand kalpas hence, all who have eyes may vie to be the first to behold them anew? No longer shall I sigh for Penglai, cut off by weak waters.” With reverence, I engraved them in sturdy catalpa wood, to share with all under heaven who are of like aspiration.\n\nThus I offer this account: This Dao, in its origin, existed before heaven and earth; in its culmination, it will endure beyond heaven and earth. Alas! Its practice shall be transmitted without end.\n\nWritten on the *chunyin* day of the *chunyang* month in the *gui-si* year of the Zhiyuan era, by Chen Cai of Jian’an, disciple of later days, who bows with burning incense.\n\n---\n\n**Register of the Luminous Dao of the Pristine Mystery**\n\nThe Primordial Lord of the Dao, the Utmost True and Great Dao, formless and nameless, empty and spontaneous, origin of the ten thousand transformations—who can speak of it? In the distant kalpas of old, *qi* congealed into images, revealing the most profound and wondrous mysteries, which were bestowed upon the Jade Sovereign of the Dao. Later, it was named the *Wondrous Mystery Scripture* and the *Responsive Jade Canon*, secreted within the Hall of Pristine Mystery and Jade Radiance.\n\nThe Sovereign of the Dao was the manifestation of the primordial *qi* of the Great Simplicity, abiding in lofty repose in the Upper Clarity, unfolding and propagating the supreme Dao. Embodied in the utmost extremity and utmost spirit, he fashioned the Jade Formula Talisman and transmitted it to the Emperor of the Pristine Mystery’s Wondrous Transformation of the True Origin of the Luminous Dao, named *Erping*, who responded to the unfolding of the celestial mandate. Assisting the Pole Star, he dwelled in the Great Vastness, penetrating the wondrous and spontaneous, expanding the myriad norms, and enduring with the Dao.\n\nDuring the Qin dynasty, he descended to the Palace of Pristine Mystery’s Wondrous Transformation in the capital of the Zhu state, also called the Palace of the Myriad Transformations of the Primordial Beginning. The Emperor’s form: clad in azure robes.\n\nThe Perfected Lord of the Wondrous Dao of the Nine Heavens, Yang Che.

During the Qin, he descended to the Palace of the Nine Heavens’ Long Plain in Hezhong Prefecture. Later, he propagated the great Dao, circulated the *Mysterious Wondrous Scripture*, and transmitted it to the Perfected Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Luminous Mystery, Xu Lingqing.\n\nThe Perfected Lord descended during the Qin to Jianzhou. With phoenix eyes and crescent-moon brows, her hair coiled in a topknot, she appeared as a woman of twenty or thirty, clad in green robes, ever holding a jade tablet. Merging with the Dao, her divine transformations were unfathomable. She dwelled in the Palace of Pristine Clarity and Mysterious Nurturance in the Nine Heavens. From the jade scriptures of the Mysterious Capital, she composed chapters and transmitted them to the Perfected of the Celestial Mountain of the Jade Hall, Zhu Xuan.\n\nThe Perfected was a native of the Eastern Capital of the Qin. With a fine beard and fair complexion, his brows were broad and long. As the Zhou dynasty declined and the world fell into chaos, he entered Langzhou to pay homage to Perfected Xu, attained the Dao, and ascended to Perfection. He dwelled in the Palace of the Mysterious Numinosity of the Phoenix Pavilion in the Grand Clarity of Mount Jinhua. Later, he transmitted the *Thunder’s Primordial Vibrant Radiance* chapters to the Perfected Lord of the Great Mystery’s Azure Wisdom and Transformative Fusang, Bu Ji.\n\nThe Perfected Lord wore a crown of green jade, his complexion lustrous as white jade. A native of Suizhou, he fled the Qin’s turmoil to Langzhou, where he paid homage to Perfected Zhu. Delving into the mysteries of the void, he attained the rank of the Great Mystery. The Perfected dwelled in the Palace of Illustrious Numinosity between the Horn and Neck stars, and with the Jade Talisman of the Dao’s Primordial Measure and Primordial Radiance, he transmitted it to the Perfected Lord of Illustrious Congealment and Radiant Protection of the Celestial Dao’s Transformative Origin, Guang Rong.\n\nThe Perfected Lord descended during the Qin in Fengzhou. Amid the chaos of the age, he entered the Western Capital, where he obtained the wonders of the Jade Talisman. When the Dao congealed in mystery, and after Emperor Gao of Han pacified the realm, he ascended to Perfection in Henan Prefecture, dwelling in the Palace of Divine Radiance on the Divine Continent of the Eastern Sea. With the *Jade Radiance Precious Chapters*, he transmitted them to the Perfected Lord of Illustrious Clarity and Dao’s Florescence, Qiu Mu.\n\nThe Perfected Lord was a native of Shouzhou in the early Han. Having grasped the purport of the Precious Chapters, he gathered the myriad *qi* to meet the flourishing of heaven. He dwelled in the Left Palace of the Grand Supreme, in the Capital of Vast Clarity, and later transmitted the Pivot of the Dao to the Perfected of Illustrious Clarity and Pristine Wisdom of the Qin, Shi Fu.\n\nThe Perfected was a man of the Han dynasty, the transformed body of the Great Emperor of the Eastern Florescence. With a spirit resolute and outstanding, he embodied the Dao’s celestial workings. He dwelled in the Grotto of Luminous Communication on Dragon Mound Mountain. The Perfected Lord of the Pristine Mystery’s Luminous Treasure Balance and Purple Florescence’s Primordial Harmony and Illustrious Dao, the Supreme Unity’s Divine Effulgence, Wang Hong. Also named Zheng Hong.\n\nThe Perfected Lord had a full-moon visage, a single-stroke brow, phoenix eyes, unbound hair, and wielded a sword, his feet clad in vermilion shoes. A transformed body of the Supreme Unity and the Moon’s Comet, he governed the pivot of the mysterious. He dwelled in the Palace of Purple Radiance to the right of the Great Vastness Tower in the Mysterious Capital. Later, he disseminated the *Pristine Mystery’s Hidden Oral Instructions* and the *Incense of the Myriad Spirits of the Primordial Beginning* among the world of men.\n\nThe Perfected Lord of the Supreme Unity’s Thoroughly Wondrous and Transformative Primordial Harmony, Xie Jingang. The Perfected Lord was the congealed perfection of the Great Ultimate, a distinct body of the Primordial Beginning. His divine transformations were hidden and unfathomable, their beginning and end unknowable. Often manifesting in subtle and elusive forms, none could recognize him. Silently wielding the pivot, he commanded the myriad spirits, without relying on talismans, charts, vermilion ink, or any tangible object. Wherever he lodged, he took form, unfolding the wonders of the Dao. He transmitted secret oral instructions, passed down from mouth to mouth, and dwelled in the Palace of Primordial Harmony to the left of the Altar of the Sunlit Valley.\n\nThe Perfected Lord of the Pristine Mystery’s Flourishing Dawn and Protective Workings, Golden Radiance, Peng Hanyuan. The Perfected Lord had twin topknots, a complexion like jade, crescent-moon brows, and phoenix eyes, ever smiling. Clad in plain robes and a crimson skirt, wielding a sword, he rode a fire dragon. Dwelling in the Palace of Cinnabar Radiance between the Well and Ghost stars, he commanded the thirty thousand hosts of the Cinnabar Radiance’s wind, fire, and thunder, serving as their marshal. He disseminated the essential wonders of the Pristine Mystery among the world of men.\n\nThe Perfected Lady of Universal Wisdom and Grace, Páng Qiǎodào of the Western Florescence. The Perfected Lady held charge of the Primordial Proscriptions, the jade-classics and phoenix-records, safeguarding and regulating the kalpic destinies, pacifying and stabilizing the cosmos.

During the Shenjue era of the Han dynasty, she later resided at the Gēngchú retreat, which lay in Sīzhú County of Hànzhōu, twenty-five li from the walled city, with two sites. Dwelling in the Western Florescence’s Palace of Vast Authenticity, she revealed the Three Ways and Three Scriptures, governing and overseeing the Three Realms. Later, she transformed her embodiment into the Perfected Lady of Grand Harmony and Hidden Mystery, Sòng Yìchéng, assuming the office of propagating the teachings of the Three Heavens, and resided in the Palace of Flourishing Propriety. The Perfected Lady of Numinous Wonder and Serene Clarity, Xū Dōng. The Perfected Lady was a native of Péngzhōu during the Eastern Han, her immortal bearing dignified and solemn. She naturally attained the Dao, responding to the world as a teacher, her names and titles manifold. She held charge of the wondrous Dao of the Pristine Mystery and dwelled in the Palace of Jade Harmony. The Illustrious Great Envoy of the Supreme Dao, the Perfected Lord of Mysterious Efficacy and Wondrous Salvation, Xǔ Xùn. His deeds are recorded in his own hagiography. The Perfected Lord attained the wondrous mysteries of the Prior Heaven, supporting the world and delivering the people—his achievements beyond recounting.\n\nThus the precept states: \"The Golden Script and Jade Registers are transmitted through the world—neither to be lightly disclosed nor concealed in secrecy.\"\n\nLater, the Pure Brightness Dharma was revealed to posterity, its inner secrets profound and beyond all description. Residing in the Palace of Jade Capital and Pure Celebration, she oversaw the Heavenly Mechanism Bureau and presided over the wondrous mysteries of the Pristine Mystery.\n\nThe Celestial Official of Southern Mound and Floating Radiance, Lǎngqī. The Celestial Official, the Venerable Emperor of Southern Mound, held command of the Thunder Pivot. During the Tang, he descended upon the Western Capital, revealing scriptures to deliver humankind.

The Primordial Lady was the mysterious essence of the Golden Mother of Sùhuá and the numinous spirit of the Heavenly One and Mysterious Dipper. She governed the sources of the rivers, controlled the water gates, and all the great spirits of the Four Darknesses were subject to her, presiding over the revelation of scriptures. Descending in the Tang dynasty, she oversaw the teachings and doctrines, mastered the profound mysteries of the Pristine Mystery, and resided in the Palace of Luminous Purity in the Eastern Sea. Later, she transformed into the Primordial Lady of the Pristine Mystery’s Primordial Mechanism and Primordial Numinosity, Lóng Jí. With twin topknots and the countenance of a jade maiden, her face slightly flushed, she wore purple robes and a green skirt, wielded a sword, and rode a white dragon. She dwelled in the Palace of Cavernous Mystery, where the revolving currents of the Pristine Mystery’s teachings flowed.\n\nShe further transformed into the Primordial Lady of the Pristine Mystery’s Numinous Harmony, Guǎn Jìngqīng. Adorned with a phoenix crown and jade features, her eyebrows naturally arched, her eyes like those of a phoenix, she wore purple garments, a green skirt, a broad sash, and vermilion shoes, holding a jade tablet.

The Primordial Mother, in whom the One Qi gestated the Perfected, was the teacher of all immortals, from whom all life and transformation proceeded. The transmission passed from mouth to mouth, never recorded in writing. She resided in the Palace of Grand Simplicity in the Western Golden Terrace of the White Jade Tortoise Platform.\n\nHe transmitted the Dao to the Golden Portal’s Supreme Minister, the Eastern Florescence’s Director of Destinies, the Lord of the Dao of the Azure Lad and Wooden Duke. The Lord of the Dao harmonized with the Nine Yangs to nurture beings and gathered the myriad transformations to face the primordial. His imperial countenance wore azure robes and resided in the Palace of the Square Reservoir.\n\nThe Golden Portal’s Grand Preceptor, the Jade Immortal of the White Mountain Palace, the Pure Abyss of Grand Simplicity, the Primordial Lady Lǐ.

His eyebrows slightly dark, his phoenix eyes crimson, clad in purple robes, with the countenance of a perfected one, he resided in the Central Palace beneath the Palace of Extensive Apprehension in Lesser Existence.\n\nThe various Perfected transmitted the pivot of the Dao to the Golden Portal’s Supreme Guardian, the Primordial Lady of High Primordiality and Purple Tenuity, Wèi Huàcún, styled Xián’ān. The Primordial Lady’s deeds are recorded in her own hagiography.

Crowned with a floral headdress and clad in purple robes, she resided in the Palace of Trustworthy Brilliance in the Western Florescence, overseeing the repository of the Primordial Beginning’s charts and books.\n\nShe transmitted the Dao to the Grand Historian of the Nine Provinces and Governor of All Immortals, the Illustrious Great Envoy Xǔ Xùn, who in turn transmitted it to the Grand Purity’s Supreme Mystery and Primordial Lady, Wén Yōng.

Jade tablets and jasper texts broadly receive and unfold transformation, widely propagating the supreme Dao. A decree was issued to:\n\nThe Grand Mystery Primordial Unity Perfected One, the Jade Purity Wondrous Dao Azure Yang Heavenly Lord Yùluóqiào, clad in blue, governing the Mysterious Capital’s Responsive Radiance Prefecture and Dragon Brahma Palace, residing in the Azure Yang Primordial Upper Palace.\n\nThe Grand Mystery Primordial Two Perfected One, the Supreme Purity Wondrous Transformation Cinnabar Yang Heavenly Lord Guāngmiàoyīn, clad in purple, governing the Mysterious Capital’s Ancestral Azure Prefecture and Universal Brilliance Palace, residing in the Cinnabar Yang Primordial Middle Palace.\n\nThe Grand Mystery Primordial Three Perfected One, the Grand Purity Wondrous Response Purple Yang Heavenly Lord Zhēndìngguāng, clad in white, governing the Mysterious Capital’s Upright Prosperity Prefecture and Vast Purity Palace, residing in the Purple Yang Primordial Completion Palace.\n\nThe three Perfected Ones above all bear the countenance of the Heavenly Worthies, their positions exalted in the Grand Ultimate.

They preside over the Yellow Register Court’s Numinous Treasure Great Dharma Office, with all thirty-six Lords and twenty-four talismans of the Numinous Treasure subject to their authority.\n\nThe Grand Ultimate Perfected One Xú Láilè—his deeds are recorded in the *Immortals’ Biographies*. The Perfected One attained the wondrous契 of the Grand Ultimate’s Three Enclosures and the regulations of the Five Methods of the Central Alliance. He resided beneath the Grand Ultimate’s August Radiance Palace.\n\nLater, he transmitted the Dao to the Grand Ultimate’s Inner Attendant, Supreme Purity’s Penetrating Response and Blessed Assistance Perfected Lord, Left Palace Immortal Duke Gé Xuán, styled Xiàoxiān. His deeds are recorded in the *Immortals’ Biographies*. A native of the Zhāohào era, he received the wondrous Dao from Master Xú, traversed famous mountains, and was moved by the Grand Ultimate’s Three Perfected Ones, who descended to transmit the Three Caverns’ precious scriptures. Devoted solely to salvation, his name was listed in the imperial court. He resided in the Grand Ultimate’s Numinous Office Palace, and the *Daily Records of Immortal Gé* were produced there. He governed the Grand Ultimate Ministry.\n\nHe transmitted the Dao to the Grand Ultimate’s Celebratory Fusion and Northern Numinous Inner Assistant Perfected One Zhèng Sīyuǎn. The Perfected One received his master’s Numinous Treasure lineage, his position exalted among the highest ranks—further details are recorded in the *Immortals’ Biographies*.

The Immortal Elder received the heart-transmission of the Grand Ultimate, paid homage at blessed courts, and ascended beyond the Golden Gates. His writings and records have been transmitted to the world.\n\nLater, he transmitted the Dao to the Grand Purity’s Supreme Mystery Primordial Lady Wén Yōng, and the Primordial Lady succeeded her.\n\n**Orthodox Lineage of the Dao and Virtue**\nThe Golden Gate’s Primordial Elder Lord, the Heavenly Worthy of Dao and Virtue. The Primordial Elder responded to transformation, revealing scriptures in the Middle Antiquity. From the Sovereign Lord above to the blazing Hàn below, he adapted to the times, styled by era, serving as the imperial teacher. Effortless and natural, compassionate and frugal, he restored inherent nature. On the day he passed the pass, he transmitted the Dao to the Gatekeeper Perfected One Yǐn Xǐ, styled Wénshǐ. The Perfected One was a grandee of King Kāng of Zhōu. Gazing upward and downward, he observed the purple qi advancing westward. By the time of King Zhāo, he had become the gatekeeper. He admonished the officials to await and inquire, knowing and welcoming him. Having attained the essence of the Dao and Virtue, he ascended into the formless.\n\nThe Grand Mystery Perfected One Zhào Lóng, large-eyed, bearing the countenance of a Perfected One, clad in crimson. The Heavenly Mountain Perfected One Hóng Bīn, with fine whiskers, bearing the countenance of a Perfected One, clad in crimson. The Primordial Upper Perfected One Lǔ Huì, pale-complexioned, clad in blue. From Zhōu to Táng, over a thousand years had passed. The three Perfected Ones, master and disciple, followed in succession, attaining the principle of prolonged vision. Whether hidden or manifest, responding to titles, the Dao is never far from humanity. Thus, the Grand Purity’s Supreme Mystery Primordial Lady Wén Yōng carried on the lineage afterward, and the Primordial Lady emerged to continue the thread.\n\n**Orthodox Origin**\nThe Supreme Primordial Elder Lord—the essence of the Orthodox Unity—revealed scriptures, styled by era, yet the Dao’s myriad names are united as one. What division could there be? By the end of the Hàn, human hearts had grown shallow and insubstantial, none more so than then. The Supreme One pitied the multitudes, though it was not by choice. If people could understand the principle of neither inclining nor wavering, what need would there be for the Heavenly Worthy’s establishment of teachings? As for instructions to reform and distance oneself from transgressions, or the forms of transmitting scriptures and registers, these merely teach people to do good. Transmitting them to the utmost person renews their virtue.\n\n**The Three Heavenly Sage Masters**\nThe Supreme Mystery’s Grand Attendant, Orthodox Unity Perfected Lord Zhāng Dàolíng—his deeds are recorded in the *Immortals’ Biographies*. A descendant of Hàn’s Master of the Chamber, a native of Pèi, he was spiritually efficacious from birth, broadly mastering literature. Moved by the Supreme One, he personally received the Dao of Alliance and Might. The Hàn emperor summoned him, but he did not rise. In the second year of Yǒngshòu, he ascended in broad daylight, governing the Supreme Mystery Ministry, presiding over the Primordial Radiance Prefecture, and residing in the Jade Simplicity Primordial Capital Palace.\n\nHis successor, the Grand Purity Perfected One, Attendant-in-Ordinary Zhāng Héng, was the Perfected Lord’s eldest son—his deeds are recorded in the *Immortals’ Biographies*. His successor, the Grand Purity Perfected One, Marquis of Làngzhōng Zhāng Lǔ, was the Perfected Lord’s second son—his deeds are recorded in the *Immortals’ Biographies*.\n\nThe female master, the Perfected Lord’s eldest daughter, Lady Wénjī, was the Princess of Líng. The next, the Three Worthies of Wénguāng, was the Princess of Yān. The Four Mushrooms and Four Masters all ascended and concealed themselves, later generations emerging from nonbeing into being.\n\nHe transmitted the Dao to the Grand Purity’s Supreme Mystery Primordial Lady Wén Yōng, and the Primordial Lady was thus able to inherit the blessings.\n\n**Convergence of the Dao**\nThe Pure Tenuity’s Attendant Primordial, Supreme Capital’s Grand Perfected of the Nine Qi, Primordial Numinous Lady—the Grand August Radiant Cavern Yang Golden Gate’s Illustrious Congealed Wondrous Dao Preserving Immortal Primordial Lady Zǔshū, also named Suìdào, styled Fǎngzhòng. A transformation of the Moon’s Comet, she descended in the time of Táng’s Emperor Zhāozōng, a native of Línglíng Prefecture in Guǎngxī. Her face was the color of a jujube, her eyes large, and her stature seven feet tall. From childhood, she maintained integrity, born with spiritual efficacy. Her parents could not restrain her, so she entered the Dao. Traversing famous mountains, she arrived at the river islet’s stone in Guìyáng Commandery, where she encountered the Protective Radiance Primordial Consort, who transformed into a numinous light. The Sagely Mother transmitted to her the mysteries of the Pure Tenuity’s natural and prior-heavenly essence. Sometimes bare-armed with a bamboo hairpin, wielding a sword and sitting on stone, she whistled to command wind and thunder, flying through the mortal world. Later, she arrived near the Western Capital’s mountains, where the caverns were pure and numinous, and the Divine Transformation Stream flowed. Moved by the Grand Purity’s Supreme Mystery Primordial Lady Wén, who transformed into a beautiful woman and bathed by the stream’s bank, the master held her towel and attended her, welcoming her to the shore. For several nights, she manifested as male and female fierce beasts and strange forms, testing her through myriad trials, yet she showed no weariness. Knowing her sincerity was unshakable, she summoned her to ride a wooden raft and drift with the current. Returning to the former place, she transmitted to her all the essences of the Supreme Purity, Numinous Treasure, Dao and Virtue, and Orthodox Unity, then vanished from sight. The master synthesized the mysteries of the five lineages, commanding thunder and lightning, her transformations manifold.\n\nAt times she rode a dragon, wielded a sword, and commanded the myriad spirits. At others, crowned in gold and clad in white, she presided in her grotto-palace, her nature fierce and commands stern—even the Thunder Gods deferred to her severity. Now she governs the Luminous Grotto of Pure Tenuity, upholding the teachings, and those who inherit her lineage must offer utmost loyalty. Should they stray even slightly, her wrath descends without delay.\n\nShe is also known as the Radiant Sovereign of Universal Transformation. Later, she transformed into the Illustrious Sovereign of Pure Tenuity’s Inspection and Manifest Virtue, Xiūduān: her hair bound in a high topknot, her face fair, her brows like willow leaves, her eyes almond-shaped. Clad in azure robes and golden armor, she wields an axe, rides a black dragon, and dwells in the Palace of Sunlit Splendor. From there, the transmission of the Pure Tenuity’s Dao unfolds.\n\nWithin the Jade Chamber, the Cavern-Luminous Sovereign Guō Yùlóng, also called the Supreme Effulgent Sovereign, was a disciple of the Primordial Sovereign’s lineage. A native of the capital, her demeanor was solemn and majestic. She inherited her master’s source, holding the rank of Attendant to the Azure Radiance in the Palace of Purple Vacuity.\n\nThe Purple-Light Illuminating Perfected Sovereign of Blessed Harmony, Fù Yāngqíng, styled Zǐfāng, was a disciple of Sovereign Guō. A native of Fēng Prefecture, she upheld the integrity of purity and inherited the pivotal mechanisms of former ages. Her rank ascended to Upper Assistant of the Three Heavens, and she resided in the Palace of Flourishing Brilliance on Mount Tàihuá in the Western Sea.\n\nThe Dragon-Light Dao-Illuminating Sovereign Yáo Zhuāng, styled Shūqí, also known as the Sovereign of Vast Prosperity, was a disciple of Sovereign Fù. A native of the Western Capital, she commanded thunder and lightning, mastering the essentials of the Dao. Her rank was Attendant of the Scriptures in the Second Heaven, and she dwelt in the Palace of Majestic Wisdom, also called the Palace of Vast Forehead and Harmonious Emptiness.\n\nThe Auspicious Source Purple-Florescence Jade-Blessed Sovereign Gāo Shìyī, also known as the Purple-Pure Wondrous-Transforming Jade-Florescence Numinous-Blessed Sovereign, was a disciple of Sovereign Yáo. Born in the azure ravines of Wèi Mountain in the land of Yān, her chamber was filled with divine radiance. She inherited her master’s source and held the rank of Attendant to the Three Heavens. She is also known as the Purple-Florescence Sovereign of Lofty Destiny, residing in the Palace of Abundant Luminous Splendor.\n\nNext, she transmitted the teachings to the Western Florescence Pure Vacuity Perfected, Huá Yīng. A native of Fèngxiáng, his eyes were round and his beard fine. He abandoned his official cap to study the Dao, attaining the exalted rank of Left Minister of Luminous Primordial Clarity in the Azure Tenuity, Supreme Steward of the Grotto-Yang.\n\nLater, she transmitted to the Green City Penetrating-Blessing Perfected, Zhū Dòngyuán. A native of Chéngdū, his eyes were round and his beard fine. He dwelled in reclusion on Mount Qīngchéng, expounding the mysteries of thunder. His rank was Upper Minister of Grotto Guardianship in the Azure Tenuity, Jade Pivot Envoy of the Divine Empyrean.\n\nNext, she transmitted to the Cloud Mountain Preserving Unity Perfected, Lǐ Shǎowēi. A native of Bǎofēng by the waters of Fáng Prefecture, the site of his former dwelling still remains, known to people as the Residence of Lord Thunder Lǐ. Born into an official family of Fánglíng, he abandoned worldly life to awaken to the real. Moved by his master’s transmission of the Dao, he held the rank of Right Minister of the Azure Tenuity’s Capital. Later, celestial officials descended, conveying the imperial decree to appoint him as Envoy of the Five Thunder Courts. Thereafter, he ascended to traverse the Three Realms, his appearances and vanishings beyond reckoning.\n\nThe Eyebrow Mountain Concealing Obscurity Perfected, Nán Bìdào. Originally surnamed Dōngnán, his given name was Guī. Born in Méishān on the third day of the eleventh month of the year *bǐngchén* at the hour of *yín*, he distinguished himself in Confucian studies as a youth and entered officialdom. Once, while serving as an assistant in the eastern lakes, he dreamed at night of a divine being who told him his master had arrived. At dawn, he went to the outskirts to welcome him and found the visitor’s appearance matched his dream. Upon inquiry, he learned it was the Preserving Unity Perfected. He welcomed him home and treated him with the rites due a master. Several times he tested him with difficult matters, yet his resolve remained firm as metal and stone. Thus, he entrusted him with all the profound mysteries. After the transmission was complete, the master vanished in a radiance of golden light.\n\nLater, while overseeing the Grand Canal, at noon he saw a celestial official in crimson robes descend from the heavens, announcing: \"By the August Emperor’s decree, you are to be invested as the Sixfold Mastery Water Controller of the Dipper.\" He was further appointed as the Preserving Harmony Immortal Minister of the Qingwei tradition. Later, he served as an advisor to Emperor Lizong of the Song, repeatedly offering remonstrances that went unheeded, and so he retired into reclusion. His whereabouts became unknown, and people believed he had ascended as an immortal.\n\nThe Azure Waters Thunder Abyss Perfected, Huang Shunshen. The master hailed from an eminent family of Min, known as the Flame of the Cinnabar Mountain Recluse, in what is now Jianning Prefecture. Born on the fifth day of the intercalary eighth month of the year *jiǎshēn* at the hour of *wèi*, he inherited his grandfather’s official rank yet was extraordinary from birth—his countenance ancient and surpassingly refined, his nature keenly perceptive. The classics, histories, and the hundred schools of thought he mastered without exception. At sixteen, while attending his father, who served as an instructor in the Grand Canal administration, he fell ill. The Southern Perfected healed him with talismans, and thunder resounded in the courtyard, instantly curing his ailment. Observing his bone structure befitted one destined for immortality, the Perfected transmitted all his teachings to him.\n\nDuring the *Baoyou* era, he emerged to serve as an inspector, and the Song imperial brother Zhao Mengduan, the Prince’s Envoy, became his disciple. Emperor Lizong summoned him for an audience and bestowed upon him the imperial calligraphy \"Thunder Abyss Perfected\" in four characters. In the year *bǐngxū* of the *Zhiyuan* era, he was summoned to court, where his responses were lucid and astute, earning the emperor’s reverence. Shortly after, he petitioned to return to the mountains, and the emperor granted his request, further bestowing a light carriage for his journey home.\n\nThe master’s disciples numbered in the hundreds. Today, the Qingwei Daoist methods flourish in the world, and though many have grasped their essential mysteries and demonstrated their numinous efficacy, such individuals remain few. The master once prefaced *The Thunder Canon* with these words: \"When the signs of the Five Mounds are manifest, a perfected one shall emerge, and those who follow shall be as reeds bound together—how could this not be so?\"",

One fascicle. Source text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, section *Dongzhen*, category *Xielu*.\n\n**Preface to The Immortal Register of Qingwei**\n\nThe Dao exists prior to the Great Ultimate—what does this mean? Before Heaven and Earth arose, the Great Ultimate already was. Could anything precede it? As the scriptures say: \"The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth.\" If this is the origin, then does it not exist before Heaven and Earth?\n\nNow, Heaven’s movements—sun and moon in their courses, wind and rain in their dispersal and nourishment, thunder and lightning in their stirring—are known as Heaven’s transformations, yet none recognize them as the workings of the Dao. Alas! Were the Dao’s workings to cease for even a single breath, Heaven’s transformations would halt.\n\nDoes not the *Book of Changes* say: \"Great indeed is the Qian’s primordial power! All things owe their beginning to it, and it governs Heaven.\" It also states: \"That which precedes Heaven—Heaven does not oppose it.\" If even Heaven does not oppose it, how much less would humans, how much less spirits and gods?\n\nThus, the Dao’s mysteries, from the outset, could not remain untransmitted. Its transmission began with the Primordial Beginning, then divided into the Jade Dawn and the Lord Lao. Through further divisions, it branched into the four lineages of Zhenyuan, Taihua, Guanling, and Zhengyi. After ten transmissions, it reached the Ancestral Perfected Sovereign Zhao Ning, where it once more unified.\n\nEight transmissions later, it came to the Perfected of Hidden Chaos, Master Nan. Master Nan’s learning encompassed Heaven and humanity; he served the Song as a high official. Encountering the Perfected of Preserving Unity, he received the Supreme Dao, thereafter commanding spirits and gods, summoning thunder and rain, moving celestial envoys, and ascending to the Immortal Bureaus.\n\nIn his later years, he met Master Huang of Thunder’s Tribulation, marveled at him, and transmitted all his writings. Master Huang pondered deeply, composed works, and expounded the lineage’s principles, thereby completing the corpus.\n\nIn all prayers and invocations, he could, as if holding a sure pledge, achieve results without effort or display, exacting recompense from the vast and empty void with unerring precision—how divine! At that time, princes and nobles vied to enlist him, and disciples from all directions numbered in the thousands.\n\nSome glimpsed a fragment, others plagiarized half a method; when hastily tested, none failed to yield results.",

      "translated_text": "Yet Master Huang treasured his writings, disdaining to impart them to others, so though scholars thronged in great numbers, few beheld the full arcana. Recently, summoned by imperial decree to court, he received leave to return to the mountains, and only then did I gain admittance to his gate. In moments of leisure, we would converse at ease, and whenever we discussed the subtleties of the Dao, he would press the matter again and again. Though I was the last to encounter the Master, I received his teachings most profoundly. One day, he said to me: “I am old now, and have seen many people, yet none has grasped the essence in silence, heart communicating with heart, steadfast in faith and resolute in practice, as you have. This must be heaven’s gift, not man’s doing.” Thereupon, he brought forth all the writings he had received from Master Nan and bestowed them upon me.\n\nOn the day I bowed to receive them, I secretly vowed: “Though I entered the Master’s gate late, I have been able to refine myself through his teachings, and now I have also obtained his writings. How dare I not spread their transmission, that in a thousand kalpas hence, all who have eyes may vie to be the first to behold them anew? No longer shall I sigh for Penglai, cut off by weak waters.” With reverence, I engraved them in sturdy catalpa wood, to share with all under heaven who are of like aspiration.\n\nThus I offer this account: This Dao, in its origin, existed before heaven and earth; in its culmination, it will endure beyond heaven and earth. Alas! Its practice shall be transmitted without end.\n\nWritten on the *chunyin* day of the *chunyang* month in the *gui-si* year of the Zhiyuan era, by Chen Cai of Jian’an, disciple of later days, who bows with burning incense.\n\n---\n\n**Register of the Luminous Dao of the Pristine Mystery**\n\nThe Primordial Lord of the Dao, the Utmost True and Great Dao, formless and nameless, empty and spontaneous, origin of the ten thousand transformations—who can speak of it? In the distant kalpas of old, *qi* congealed into images, revealing the most profound and wondrous mysteries, which were bestowed upon the Jade Sovereign of the Dao. Later, it was named the *Wondrous Mystery Scripture* and the *Responsive Jade Canon*, secreted within the Hall of Pristine Mystery and Jade Radiance.\n\nThe Sovereign of the Dao was the manifestation of the primordial *qi* of the Great Simplicity, abiding in lofty repose in the Upper Clarity, unfolding and propagating the supreme Dao. Embodied in the utmost extremity and utmost spirit, he fashioned the Jade Formula Talisman and transmitted it to the Emperor of the Pristine Mystery’s Wondrous Transformation of the True Origin of the Luminous Dao, named *Erping*, who responded to the unfolding of the celestial mandate. Assisting the Pole Star, he dwelled in the Great Vastness, penetrating the wondrous and spontaneous, expanding the myriad norms, and enduring with the Dao.\n\nDuring the Qin dynasty, he descended to the Palace of Pristine Mystery’s Wondrous Transformation in the capital of the Zhu state, also called the Palace of the Myriad Transformations of the Primordial Beginning. The Emperor’s form: clad in azure robes.\n\nThe Perfected Lord of the Wondrous Dao of the Nine Heavens, Yang Che. The Perfected Lord was the transformed body of the Primordial Beginning’s singular *qi*, with a blue-green countenance and unbound hair, a dragon’s form, riding flowing fire to enter and exit the Three Realms, known as the deity who governs the pivot of thunder and lightning. During the Qin, he descended to the Palace of the Nine Heavens’ Long Plain in Hezhong Prefecture. Later, he propagated the great Dao, circulated the *Mysterious Wondrous Scripture*, and transmitted it to the Perfected Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Luminous Mystery, Xu Lingqing.\n\nThe Perfected Lord descended during the Qin to Jianzhou. With phoenix eyes and crescent-moon brows, her hair coiled in a topknot, she appeared as a woman of twenty or thirty, clad in green robes, ever holding a jade tablet. Merging with the Dao, her divine transformations were unfathomable. She dwelled in the Palace of Pristine Clarity and Mysterious Nurturance in the Nine Heavens. From the jade scriptures of the Mysterious Capital, she composed chapters and transmitted them to the Perfected of the Celestial Mountain of the Jade Hall, Zhu Xuan.\n\nThe Perfected was a native of the Eastern Capital of the Qin. With a fine beard and fair complexion, his brows were broad and long. As the Zhou dynasty declined and the world fell into chaos, he entered Langzhou to pay homage to Perfected Xu, attained the Dao, and ascended to Perfection. He dwelled in the Palace of the Mysterious Numinosity of the Phoenix Pavilion in the Grand Clarity of Mount Jinhua. Later, he transmitted the *Thunder’s Primordial Vibrant Radiance* chapters to the Perfected Lord of the Great Mystery’s Azure Wisdom and Transformative Fusang, Bu Ji.\n\nThe Perfected Lord wore a crown of green jade, his complexion lustrous as white jade. A native of Suizhou, he fled the Qin’s turmoil to Langzhou, where he paid homage to Perfected Zhu. Delving into the mysteries of the void, he attained the rank of the Great Mystery. The Perfected dwelled in the Palace of Illustrious Numinosity between the Horn and Neck stars, and with the Jade Talisman of the Dao’s Primordial Measure and Primordial Radiance, he transmitted it to the Perfected Lord of Illustrious Congealment and Radiant Protection of the Celestial Dao’s Transformative Origin, Guang Rong.\n\nThe Perfected Lord descended during the Qin in Fengzhou. Amid the chaos of the age, he entered the Western Capital, where he obtained the wonders of the Jade Talisman. When the Dao congealed in mystery, and after Emperor Gao of Han pacified the realm, he ascended to Perfection in Henan Prefecture, dwelling in the Palace of Divine Radiance on the Divine Continent of the Eastern Sea. With the *Jade Radiance Precious Chapters*, he transmitted them to the Perfected Lord of Illustrious Clarity and Dao’s Florescence, Qiu Mu.\n\nThe Perfected Lord was a native of Shouzhou in the early Han. Having grasped the purport of the Precious Chapters, he gathered the myriad *qi* to meet the flourishing of heaven. He dwelled in the Left Palace of the Grand Supreme, in the Capital of Vast Clarity, and later transmitted the Pivot of the Dao to the Perfected of Illustrious Clarity and Pristine Wisdom of the Qin, Shi Fu.\n\nThe Perfected was a man of the Han dynasty, the transformed body of the Great Emperor of the Eastern Florescence. With a spirit resolute and outstanding, he embodied the Dao’s celestial workings. He dwelled in the Grotto of Luminous Communication on Dragon Mound Mountain. The Perfected Lord of the Pristine Mystery’s Luminous Treasure Balance and Purple Florescence’s Primordial Harmony and Illustrious Dao, the Supreme Unity’s Divine Effulgence, Wang Hong. Also named Zheng Hong.\n\nThe Perfected Lord had a full-moon visage, a single-stroke brow, phoenix eyes, unbound hair, and wielded a sword, his feet clad in vermilion shoes. A transformed body of the Supreme Unity and the Moon’s Comet, he governed the pivot of the mysterious. He dwelled in the Palace of Purple Radiance to the right of the Great Vastness Tower in the Mysterious Capital. Later, he disseminated the *Pristine Mystery’s Hidden Oral Instructions* and the *Incense of the Myriad Spirits of the Primordial Beginning* among the world of men.\n\nThe Perfected Lord of the Supreme Unity’s Thoroughly Wondrous and Transformative Primordial Harmony, Xie Jingang. The Perfected Lord was the congealed perfection of the Great Ultimate, a distinct body of the Primordial Beginning. His divine transformations were hidden and unfathomable, their beginning and end unknowable. Often manifesting in subtle and elusive forms, none could recognize him. Silently wielding the pivot, he commanded the myriad spirits, without relying on talismans, charts, vermilion ink, or any tangible object. Wherever he lodged, he took form, unfolding the wonders of the Dao. He transmitted secret oral instructions, passed down from mouth to mouth, and dwelled in the Palace of Primordial Harmony to the left of the Altar of the Sunlit Valley.\n\nThe Perfected Lord of the Pristine Mystery’s Flourishing Dawn and Protective Workings, Golden Radiance, Peng Hanyuan. The Perfected Lord had twin topknots, a complexion like jade, crescent-moon brows, and phoenix eyes, ever smiling. Clad in plain robes and a crimson skirt, wielding a sword, he rode a fire dragon. Dwelling in the Palace of Cinnabar Radiance between the Well and Ghost stars, he commanded the thirty thousand hosts of the Cinnabar Radiance’s wind, fire, and thunder, serving as their marshal. He disseminated the essential wonders of the Pristine Mystery among the world of men.",

She governed the sources of the rivers, controlled the water gates, and all the great spirits of the Four Darknesses were subject to her, presiding over the revelation of scriptures. Descending in the Tang dynasty, she oversaw the teachings and doctrines, mastered the profound mysteries of the Pristine Mystery, and resided in the Palace of Luminous Purity in the Eastern Sea. Later, she transformed into the Primordial Lady of the Pristine Mystery’s Primordial Mechanism and Primordial Numinosity, Lóng Jí.

      "translated_text": "The Three Blacks Convene the True, the Primordial Black Gives Birth to the Myriad Beings Heavenly Worthy—bestowing compassion to benefit all things, universally delivering the boundless—thus the Numinous Treasure stands as the origin of all spirits. Jade tablets and jasper texts broadly receive and unfold transformation, widely propagating the supreme Dao. A decree was issued to:\n\nThe Grand Mystery Primordial Unity Perfected One, the Jade Purity Wondrous Dao Azure Yang Heavenly Lord Yùluóqiào, clad in blue, governing the Mysterious Capital’s Responsive Radiance Prefecture and Dragon Brahma Palace, residing in the Azure Yang Primordial Upper Palace.\n\nThe Grand Mystery Primordial Two Perfected One, the Supreme Purity Wondrous Transformation Cinnabar Yang Heavenly Lord Guāngmiàoyīn, clad in purple, governing the Mysterious Capital’s Ancestral Azure Prefecture and Universal Brilliance Palace, residing in the Cinnabar Yang Primordial Middle Palace.\n\nThe Grand Mystery Primordial Three Perfected One, the Grand Purity Wondrous Response Purple Yang Heavenly Lord Zhēndìngguāng, clad in white, governing the Mysterious Capital’s Upright Prosperity Prefecture and Vast Purity Palace, residing in the Purple Yang Primordial Completion Palace.\n\nThe three Perfected Ones above all bear the countenance of the Heavenly Worthies, their positions exalted in the Grand Ultimate. They are styled the Responding Three Purities, to whom the Dao Lord transmitted the Responsive Transformation True Talismans. They preside over the Yellow Register Court’s Numinous Treasure Great Dharma Office, with all thirty-six Lords and twenty-four talismans of the Numinous Treasure subject to their authority.\n\nThe Grand Ultimate Perfected One Xú Láilè—his deeds are recorded in the *Immortals’ Biographies*. The Perfected One attained the wondrous契 of the Grand Ultimate’s Three Enclosures and the regulations of the Five Methods of the Central Alliance. He resided beneath the Grand Ultimate’s August Radiance Palace.\n\nLater, he transmitted the Dao to the Grand Ultimate’s Inner Attendant, Supreme Purity’s Penetrating Response and Blessed Assistance Perfected Lord, Left Palace Immortal Duke Gé Xuán, styled Xiàoxiān. His deeds are recorded in the *Immortals’ Biographies*. A native of the Zhāohào era, he received the wondrous Dao from Master Xú, traversed famous mountains, and was moved by the Grand Ultimate’s Three Perfected Ones, who descended to transmit the Three Caverns’ precious scriptures. Devoted solely to salvation, his name was listed in the imperial court. He resided in the Grand Ultimate’s Numinous Office Palace, and the *Daily Records of Immortal Gé* were produced there. He governed the Grand Ultimate Ministry.\n\nHe transmitted the Dao to the Grand Ultimate’s Celebratory Fusion and Northern Numinous Inner Assistant Perfected One Zhèng Sīyuǎn. The Perfected One received his master’s Numinous Treasure lineage, his position exalted among the highest ranks—further details are recorded in the *Immortals’ Biographies*. He resided beneath the Grand Ultimate’s Primordial Penetration Prefecture.\n\nLater, he transmitted the Dao to the Unadorned Minor Immortal Elder Gé Hóng. The Immortal Elder received the heart-transmission of the Grand Ultimate, paid homage at blessed courts, and ascended beyond the Golden Gates. His writings and records have been transmitted to the world.\n\nLater, he transmitted the Dao to the Grand Purity’s Supreme Mystery Primordial Lady Wén Yōng, and the Primordial Lady succeeded her.\n\n**Orthodox Lineage of the Dao and Virtue**\nThe Golden Gate’s Primordial Elder Lord, the Heavenly Worthy of Dao and Virtue. The Primordial Elder responded to transformation, revealing scriptures in the Middle Antiquity. From the Sovereign Lord above to the blazing Hàn below, he adapted to the times, styled by era, serving as the imperial teacher. Effortless and natural, compassionate and frugal, he restored inherent nature. On the day he passed the pass, he transmitted the Dao to the Gatekeeper Perfected One Yǐn Xǐ, styled Wénshǐ. The Perfected One was a grandee of King Kāng of Zhōu. Gazing upward and downward, he observed the purple qi advancing westward. By the time of King Zhāo, he had become the gatekeeper. He admonished the officials to await and inquire, knowing and welcoming him. Having attained the essence of the Dao and Virtue, he ascended into the formless.\n\nThe Grand Mystery Perfected One Zhào Lóng, large-eyed, bearing the countenance of a Perfected One, clad in crimson. The Heavenly Mountain Perfected One Hóng Bīn, with fine whiskers, bearing the countenance of a Perfected One, clad in crimson. The Primordial Upper Perfected One Lǔ Huì, pale-complexioned, clad in blue. From Zhōu to Táng, over a thousand years had passed. The three Perfected Ones, master and disciple, followed in succession, attaining the principle of prolonged vision. Whether hidden or manifest, responding to titles, the Dao is never far from humanity. Thus, the Grand Purity’s Supreme Mystery Primordial Lady Wén Yōng carried on the lineage afterward, and the Primordial Lady emerged to continue the thread.\n\n**Orthodox Origin**\nThe Supreme Primordial Elder Lord—the essence of the Orthodox Unity—revealed scriptures, styled by era, yet the Dao’s myriad names are united as one. What division could there be? By the end of the Hàn, human hearts had grown shallow and insubstantial, none more so than then. The Supreme One pitied the multitudes, though it was not by choice. If people could understand the principle of neither inclining nor wavering, what need would there be for the Heavenly Worthy’s establishment of teachings? As for instructions to reform and distance oneself from transgressions, or the forms of transmitting scriptures and registers, these merely teach people to do good. Transmitting them to the utmost person renews their virtue.\n\n**The Three Heavenly Sage Masters**\nThe Supreme Mystery’s Grand Attendant, Orthodox Unity Perfected Lord Zhāng Dàolíng—his deeds are recorded in the *Immortals’ Biographies*. A descendant of Hàn’s Master of the Chamber, a native of Pèi, he was spiritually efficacious from birth, broadly mastering literature. Moved by the Supreme One, he personally received the Dao of Alliance and Might. The Hàn emperor summoned him, but he did not rise. In the second year of Yǒngshòu, he ascended in broad daylight, governing the Supreme Mystery Ministry, presiding over the Primordial Radiance Prefecture, and residing in the Jade Simplicity Primordial Capital Palace.\n\nHis successor, the Grand Purity Perfected One, Attendant-in-Ordinary Zhāng Héng, was the Perfected Lord’s eldest son—his deeds are recorded in the *Immortals’ Biographies*. His successor, the Grand Purity Perfected One, Marquis of Làngzhōng Zhāng Lǔ, was the Perfected Lord’s second son—his deeds are recorded in the *Immortals’ Biographies*.\n\nThe female master, the Perfected Lord’s eldest daughter, Lady Wénjī, was the Princess of Líng. The next, the Three Worthies of Wénguāng, was the Princess of Yān. The Four Mushrooms and Four Masters all ascended and concealed themselves, later generations emerging from nonbeing into being.\n\nHe transmitted the Dao to the Grand Purity’s Supreme Mystery Primordial Lady Wén Yōng, and the Primordial Lady was thus able to inherit the blessings.\n\n**Convergence of the Dao**\nThe Pure Tenuity’s Attendant Primordial, Supreme Capital’s Grand Perfected of the Nine Qi, Primordial Numinous Lady—the Grand August Radiant Cavern Yang Golden Gate’s Illustrious Congealed Wondrous Dao Preserving Immortal Primordial Lady Zǔshū, also named Suìdào, styled Fǎngzhòng. A transformation of the Moon’s Comet, she descended in the time of Táng’s Emperor Zhāozōng, a native of Línglíng Prefecture in Guǎngxī. Her face was the color of a jujube, her eyes large, and her stature seven feet tall. From childhood, she maintained integrity, born with spiritual efficacy. Her parents could not restrain her, so she entered the Dao. Traversing famous mountains, she arrived at the river islet’s stone in Guìyáng Commandery, where she encountered the Protective Radiance Primordial Consort, who transformed into a numinous light. The Sagely Mother transmitted to her the mysteries of the Pure Tenuity’s natural and prior-heavenly essence. Sometimes bare-armed with a bamboo hairpin, wielding a sword and sitting on stone, she whistled to command wind and thunder, flying through the mortal world. Later, she arrived near the Western Capital’s mountains, where the caverns were pure and numinous, and the Divine Transformation Stream flowed. Moved by the Grand Purity’s Supreme Mystery Primordial Lady Wén, who transformed into a beautiful woman and bathed by the stream’s bank, the master held her towel and attended her, welcoming her to the shore. For several nights, she manifested as male and female fierce beasts and strange forms, testing her through myriad trials, yet she showed no weariness. Knowing her sincerity was unshakable, she summoned her to ride a wooden raft and drift with the current. Returning to the former place, she transmitted to her all the essences of the Supreme Purity, Numinous Treasure, Dao and Virtue, and Orthodox Unity, then vanished from sight. The master synthesized the mysteries of the five lineages, commanding thunder and lightning, her transformations manifold.",

      "translated_text": "At times she rode a dragon, wielded a sword, and commanded the myriad spirits. At others, crowned in gold and clad in white, she presided in her grotto-palace, her nature fierce and commands stern—even the Thunder Gods deferred to her severity. Now she governs the Luminous Grotto of Pure Tenuity, upholding the teachings, and those who inherit her lineage must offer utmost loyalty. Should they stray even slightly, her wrath descends without delay.\n\nShe is also known as the Radiant Sovereign of Universal Transformation. Later, she transformed into the Illustrious Sovereign of Pure Tenuity’s Inspection and Manifest Virtue, Xiūduān: her hair bound in a high topknot, her face fair, her brows like willow leaves, her eyes almond-shaped. Clad in azure robes and golden armor, she wields an axe, rides a black dragon, and dwells in the Palace of Sunlit Splendor. From there, the transmission of the Pure Tenuity’s Dao unfolds.\n\nWithin the Jade Chamber, the Cavern-Luminous Sovereign Guō Yùlóng, also called the Supreme Effulgent Sovereign, was a disciple of the Primordial Sovereign’s lineage. A native of the capital, her demeanor was solemn and majestic. She inherited her master’s source, holding the rank of Attendant to the Azure Radiance in the Palace of Purple Vacuity.\n\nThe Purple-Light Illuminating Perfected Sovereign of Blessed Harmony, Fù Yāngqíng, styled Zǐfāng, was a disciple of Sovereign Guō. A native of Fēng Prefecture, she upheld the integrity of purity and inherited the pivotal mechanisms of former ages. Her rank ascended to Upper Assistant of the Three Heavens, and she resided in the Palace of Flourishing Brilliance on Mount Tàihuá in the Western Sea.\n\nThe Dragon-Light Dao-Illuminating Sovereign Yáo Zhuāng, styled Shūqí, also known as the Sovereign of Vast Prosperity, was a disciple of Sovereign Fù. A native of the Western Capital, she commanded thunder and lightning, mastering the essentials of the Dao. Her rank was Attendant of the Scriptures in the Second Heaven, and she dwelt in the Palace of Majestic Wisdom, also called the Palace of Vast Forehead and Harmonious Emptiness.\n\nThe Auspicious Source Purple-Florescence Jade-Blessed Sovereign Gāo Shìyī, also known as the Purple-Pure Wondrous-Transforming Jade-Florescence Numinous-Blessed Sovereign, was a disciple of Sovereign Yáo. Born in the azure ravines of Wèi Mountain in the land of Yān, her chamber was filled with divine radiance. She inherited her master’s source and held the rank of Attendant to the Three Heavens. She is also known as the Purple-Florescence Sovereign of Lofty Destiny, residing in the Palace of Abundant Luminous Splendor.\n\nNext, she transmitted the teachings to the Western Florescence Pure Vacuity Perfected, Huá Yīng. A native of Fèngxiáng, his eyes were round and his beard fine. He abandoned his official cap to study the Dao, attaining the exalted rank of Left Minister of Luminous Primordial Clarity in the Azure Tenuity, Supreme Steward of the Grotto-Yang.\n\nLater, she transmitted to the Green City Penetrating-Blessing Perfected, Zhū Dòngyuán. A native of Chéngdū, his eyes were round and his beard fine. He dwelled in reclusion on Mount Qīngchéng, expounding the mysteries of thunder. His rank was Upper Minister of Grotto Guardianship in the Azure Tenuity, Jade Pivot Envoy of the Divine Empyrean.\n\nNext, she transmitted to the Cloud Mountain Preserving Unity Perfected, Lǐ Shǎowēi. A native of Bǎofēng by the waters of Fáng Prefecture, the site of his former dwelling still remains, known to people as the Residence of Lord Thunder Lǐ. Born into an official family of Fánglíng, he abandoned worldly life to awaken to the real. Moved by his master’s transmission of the Dao, he held the rank of Right Minister of the Azure Tenuity’s Capital. Later, celestial officials descended, conveying the imperial decree to appoint him as Envoy of the Five Thunder Courts. Thereafter, he ascended to traverse the Three Realms, his appearances and vanishings beyond reckoning.\n\nThe Eyebrow Mountain Concealing Obscurity Perfected, Nán Bìdào. Originally surnamed Dōngnán, his given name was Guī. Born in Méishān on the third day of the eleventh month of the year *bǐngchén* at the hour of *yín*, he distinguished himself in Confucian studies as a youth and entered officialdom. Once, while serving as an assistant in the eastern lakes, he dreamed at night of a divine being who told him his master had arrived. At dawn, he went to the outskirts to welcome him and found the visitor’s appearance matched his dream. Upon inquiry, he learned it was the Preserving Unity Perfected. He welcomed him home and treated him with the rites due a master. Several times he tested him with difficult matters, yet his resolve remained firm as metal and stone. Thus, he entrusted him with all the profound mysteries. After the transmission was complete, the master vanished in a radiance of golden light.",

Knowing her sincerity was unshakable, she summoned her to ride a wooden raft and drift with the current. Returning to the former place, she transmitted to her all the essences of the Supreme Purity, Numinous Treasure, Dao and Virtue, and Orthodox Unity, then vanished from sight. The master synthesized the mysteries of the five lineages, commanding thunder and lightning, her transformations manifold.",

      "translated_text": "Later, while overseeing the Grand Canal, at noon he saw a celestial official in crimson robes descend from the heavens, announcing: \"By the August Emperor’s decree, you are to be invested as the Sixfold Mastery Water Controller of the Dipper.\" He was further appointed as the Preserving Harmony Immortal Minister of the Qingwei tradition. Later, he served as an advisor to Emperor Lizong of the Song, repeatedly offering remonstrances that went unheeded, and so he retired into reclusion. His whereabouts became unknown, and people believed he had ascended as an immortal.\n\nThe Azure Waters Thunder Abyss Perfected, Huang Shunshen. The master hailed from an eminent family of Min, known as the Flame of the Cinnabar Mountain Recluse, in what is now Jianning Prefecture. Born on the fifth day of the intercalary eighth month of the year *jiǎshēn* at the hour of *wèi*, he inherited his grandfather’s official rank yet was extraordinary from birth—his countenance ancient and surpassingly refined, his nature keenly perceptive. The classics, histories, and the hundred schools of thought he mastered without exception. At sixteen, while attending his father, who served as an instructor in the Grand Canal administration, he fell ill. The Southern Perfected healed him with talismans, and thunder resounded in the courtyard, instantly curing his ailment. Observing his bone structure befitted one destined for immortality, the Perfected transmitted all his teachings to him.\n\nDuring the *Baoyou* era, he emerged to serve as an inspector, and the Song imperial brother Zhao Mengduan, the Prince’s Envoy, became his disciple. Emperor Lizong summoned him for an audience and bestowed upon him the imperial calligraphy \"Thunder Abyss Perfected\" in four characters. In the year *bǐngxū* of the *Zhiyuan* era, he was summoned to court, where his responses were lucid and astute, earning the emperor’s reverence. Shortly after, he petitioned to return to the mountains, and the emperor granted his request, further bestowing a light carriage for his journey home.\n\nThe master’s disciples numbered in the hundreds. Today, the Qingwei Daoist methods flourish in the world, and though many have grasped their essential mysteries and demonstrated their numinous efficacy, such individuals remain few. The master once prefaced *The Thunder Canon* with these words: \"When the signs of the Five Mounds are manifest, a perfected one shall emerge, and those who follow shall be as reeds bound together—how could this not be so?\"",
