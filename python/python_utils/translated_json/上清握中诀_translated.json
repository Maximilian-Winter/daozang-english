  "full_translation": "**The Upper Scripture of the Upper Clarity Hand-Clasping Formula**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Upper Clarity Hand-Clasping Formula*. The original text does not specify an author, though it likely emerged during the Northern and Southern Dynasties. It is a compilation of early Upper Clarity School cultivation scriptures and formulas. *Tongzhi: Yiwen Lue* records it as authored by Tao Hongjing of the Liang dynasty. Three scrolls in total.\n\n**Source Text:** *Zhengtong Daozang*, *Dongzhen* Section, Jade Formula Category.\n\n---\n\n**Scroll One of The Upper Clarity Hand-Clasping Formula**\n*(Text missing at

flight,\nher sash is of golden bells and azure silk.\nAt her waist hangs a luminous jade,\nwhile dark clouds gather in misty splendor.\nShe bestows upon me the Hidden Script,\nascending through the Seven Qi,\nmounting the mist of Clarity in play.\nThe Perfected gather in union—\nI beseech the Flying Immortals,\ninscribing my name in the Cinnabar Realm.\nWherever I turn, wherever I wish,\nno calamity, no harm shall befall.\nShould any bear me ill,\nlet them meet with ruin and defeat.\n\n**Next: Riding the Void, Treading the Radiance**\nFrom the North Pole, ascend together to the Celestial Pass.\nPress the right hand to the heart,\npoint the left hand toward the Celestial Pass.\nHold the breath for three cycles,\nknock the teeth three times,\nswallow the saliva thrice.\nSoftly intone the prayer:\n\nO Supreme Seven Poles,\nPurple Tenuity beyond the stars,\nPrecious Mysterious Golden Chamber—\nbeyond it lies the Jade Gate.\nRevolving through the Nine Palaces,\nharmonizing the

Hidden Script,\nenabling my wandering and circling.\nMy name is enrolled among the Sage Emperors,\na Flying Immortal of the Nine Heavens.\nA golden kerchief, a girdle of truth—\nI enter and exit the Grotto Gate.\n\n**Lingering in the Three Yang**\nFrom the Auxiliary Star, ascend together to the Aligning Star.\nHold the breath for one cycle,\nknock the teeth three times,\nswallow the saliva

the root of the moon.\nA torrent of fire ten thousand fathoms long,\na skirt of golden net and azure silk.\nA tiger tally at my waist,\na floral crown upon my head.\nShe bestows upon me the Hidden Script,\nthat I may traverse the Celestial Pass.\nI beseech the Flying Immortals,\ncommanding the myriad spirits.\nWherever I turn, all shall converge,\nmy blessings and virtue like mountains.\n\n**Audience at the Four Poles**\nIn spring, pace the Net’s End,\nalign the body and enter the Dipper’s Maw.\nFace east to behold the Jupiter’s image within the liver.\nBow twice, kneel, and pray:\n\nO Spirit of the Great Year,\nWood Duke of the Nine Yang,\nPrimordial Flower of the Mysterious Origin—\ncome forth in full to enter my body.\n\nKnock the teeth nine times.\nWhen finished, ascend to the heavens and depart in spirals.\n\nIn summer, pace the Net’s End,\nalign the body and enter the Dipper’s Maw.\nFace south to behold the Fire Star’s image within the heart.\nBow twice,

times.\nWhen finished, ascend to the heavens and depart in spirals.\n\nIn autumn, pace the Net’s End,\nalign the body and enter the Dipper’s Maw.\nFace west to behold the Venus Star’s image within the lungs.\nBow twice, kneel, and pray:\n\nO Western Supreme Mystery,\nGolden Essence of the Sevenfold Dao and Jade Prime of the Two Emperors—\nlet the qi return to the fetal brain.\n\nKnock the teeth nine times.\nWhen finished, ascend to the heavens and depart in spirals.\n\nIn winter, pace the Net’s End,\nalign the body and enter the Dipper’s Maw.\nFace north to behold the Mercury Star’s image within the kidneys.\nBow twice, kneel, and pray:\n\nO Northern Dark Purple Dawn,\nGolden Chariot of the Water Origin and Dragon Womb’s Transformed Spirit—\ncome forth in full to enter my whole body.\n\nKnock the teeth nine times.\nWhen finished, ascend to the heavens and depart in spirals.\n\nOn the day of *jiǎzǐ* or the Eight Nodal Days, pace the Net’s End,\nalign the body and enter the Dipper’s Maw behind the Star of Balance.\nFace the Perfected One and visualize the Saturn Star’s image within the spleen.\nBow twice, kneel, and pray:\n\nO Supreme Ultimate of the Nine Perfected,\nFlowing Peace of the Yin Root and Flying Canopy of the One Flower—\ncome forth in full to enter the Muddy Pellet.\n\nKnock the teeth nine times.\nWhen finished, ascend to the heavens and depart in spirals.\n\nThe Rite of Pacing the Net to Shed Death’s Name and Ascend the Jade Register follows the same form, with only minor variations. On the six *jiǎ*-days, after pacing forth, turn left and face downward toward the terrace. Hold the breath, follow the Net’s threads with Yu’s step, and tread upon the stars upward to the Metal Star. First place the left foot forward and the right foot drawn back, ascending one star together. Upon reaching Metal, reverse the feet so the right leads, then tread the stars back. After nine full cycles, halt upon the Metal Star, knock the teeth three times, and release the breath. Pray thus:\n\nUpper Terrace of Void Essence,\nMiddle Terrace of Sixfold Purity,\nLower Terrace of Curved Life—\nif seeking gold and jade, invoke the Upper Terrace;\nif seeking rank and emolument, invoke the Middle Terrace;\nif seeking fields and land, invoke the Lower Terrace.\nLet the three matters follow the petitioner’s desire.\n\nThen descend along the Net’s threads in a free pace, returning to ascend the Five Stars.\n\nNext, pace the Five Stars.\nFirst face the Net’s mouth, close the eyes, hold the breath, knock the teeth five times, and swallow saliva five times. Visualize the essence of each of the Five Stars residing within the five viscera. The stars’ forms and their rays of light, along with the inner radiance of the viscera, shine through brightly. Whisper the prayer:\n\nThe Five Stars array their light,\nilluminating the five directions.\nThe Water Star averts calamity,\nthe Wood Star brings prosperity,\nthe Fiery Star dissolves misfortune,\nthe White Star repels weapons,\nthe Earth Star secures the four quarters—\nmay I gain profit and uprightness.\nMy name is inscribed on the Jade Tablet,\nrecorded in the Emperor’s chamber.\nRiding the whirlwind and fanning the light,\nI soar through the Great Void,\nentering and exiting the Dark Origin,\nroaming and feasting in the ten directions.\nFive clouds float as my canopy,\nsummoning spirits and seizing the wind,\ncommanding the myriad numina,\nto guard and serve the Transcendent Lords above.\n\nThen silently invoke the names of the Five Star Sovereigns and their Consorts, following the method of the Eightfold Invocation. Release the breath, hold it again, and step over the Net to tread upon the stars. Place the left foot upon Metal, advance the right foot to join it, and face the corresponding direction. With the left hand touching the heart, declare, “I ascend as a flying transcendent.” Next, ascend Earth, turning the feet toward Fire. Ascend Fire, then Wood, then Water, then reverse back to Wood. In all reverse movements, the right foot leads first. Thus proceed back and forth three times. Then, according to the diagram, ascend Metal, then Fire, then Earth, turning the feet toward Wood. Ascend Wood, then Water, then reverse back to Wood. Thus proceed back and forth fifteen times in total. Descend, and if fearing distraction, count on the fingers. Turn left, face the Net’s mouth, and silently pray. Each time you reach a star, join the feet, place the left hand upon the heart, invoke the name of the star’s Sovereign and his Consort, and silently declare, “I ascend as a flying transcendent.” When all is complete, kneel, roll up the diagram, and depart. Burn incense and bow twice.\n\nIf encountering malevolent ghosts or wicked persons, visualize the Dipper’s stars covering your head, point the Dipper’s handle forward, hold the breath, and silently pray:\n\nI am the Heavenly Eye,\npursuing Heaven’s course.\nMy essence is like thunder and lightning,\nilluminating the eight realms,\npenetrating all within and without,\nsubduing all without exception.\nPacing the flying step,\nin one year I avert misfortune,\nin two years I avert weapons,\nin three years I avert death,\nin four years I become an Earth Transcendent.\nPracticing this for fourteen years,\nI become a Perfected One of the Highest Clarity.\n\nThe Oral Instructions for Recording Practices and Affairs\n\nOn the night of the month’s last day at midnight, face east and write the Solar Qi Talisman in cinnabar on blue paper, and the Lunar Essence Talisman in yellow on blue paper. First hold the Solar Talisman in the left hand, hold the breath, and silently pray:\n\nThe Vermilion Script of the Great Culmen,\nnamed “Opening Brightness,”\nsummons the sun’s upper soul\nto transform my form.\nAt dawn’s strict adornment,\ndeparting from the round courtyard,\nflying blossom of the water mother,\ngolden essence of the solar root—\npurple radiance streaming light,\ncalled the Five Numinous Ones.\n\nThen ingest it. Next, hold the Lunar Talisman in the right hand, hold the breath, and silently pray:\n\nThe Yellow Script of the Purple Culmen,\nnamed “Great Mystery,”\nsummons the moon’s radiant water\nto nourish the po and harmonize the hun.\nAt the square’s strict observance,\ndeparting from the Dark Pass,\nhiding the sky and concealing the moon,\nthe Five Numinous Ladies—\nflying light of nine paths,\nilluminating the Muddy Pellet.\n\nThen ingest it.\n\nThe Method of Ingesting Solar Qi\nAt dawn, await the sun’s first rising. Face the sun, sit or stand as you wish, knock the teeth nine times, and silently invoke:\n\nSolar soul, Pearl Radiance,\nIlluminating Sheath, Green Reflection,\nReturning Rosy Clouds, Crimson Youth,\nDark Flame, Whirlwind Image.\n\nStill the eyes, clench the fists, and visualize the sun’s five-colored streaming radiance all coming to embrace the body, descending to the two feet and ascending to the crown of the head. Then see within the radiance a purple qi like an eye’s pupil, layered in dozens of folds, coming with the five colors into the mouth. Swallow it in forty-five breaths, then swallow saliva nine times, knock the teeth nine times, and whisper the prayer:\n\nCrimson furnace of cinnabar qi,\nround heaven nurturing essence,\nhardness receiving softness,\nflaming water’s yin flower—\nsolar origin’s radiant scene,\ncalled Great Brightness.\nNine yangs transform together,\ntwo smokes arise as one.\nCongealing the hun and harmonizing the po,\nessence of the five qi,\nwithin arise the Five Emperors.\nRiding the light and guiding the form,\nplucking the flying from the void,\ngrasping the root to gain fullness—\ncrown draped in dragon canopy,\nrobed in vermilion and girded in blue,\nreins of the crow flowing dark,\nrosy clouds illuminating Highest Clarity.\nBestowed the Jade Tablet’s script,\nname carved in the Golden Chamber.\nIngesting the dawn’s blossom,\nuniting with the Perfected in numinosity,\nflying transcendent of the Great Culmen,\nascending to the Purple Court.\n\nBow twice.\n\nThe Method of Ingesting Lunar Essence\nAwait the moon’s first rising. Face the moon, sit or stand as you wish, knock the teeth ten times, and silently invoke:\n\nLunar po, Warm Mist,\nFragrant Bloom, Veiled Loneliness,\nGraceful Void, Orchid’s Luxuriance,\nFlowering Knot, Pure Gold’s Luminous Jade,\nGenuine Countenance, Terrace’s Standard.\n\nStill the eyes, clench the fists, and visualize the moon’s five-colored streaming essence all coming to embrace the body, descending to the two feet and ascending to the crown of the head. Then see within the radiance a yellow qi like an eye’s pupil, layered in dozens of folds, coming with the five colors into the mouth. Swallow it in fifty breaths, then swallow saliva ten times, knock the teeth ten times, and whisper the prayer:\n\nYellow-green, dark radiance,\nprimal yin’s upper qi,\nscattering the luxuriant cold whirlwind,\ngathering the numinous and restraining the stomach—\nnuminous waves, orchid’s sharpness,\nupright and washed, halting the vessel.\nLunar essence, night’s scene,\nsupreme treasure of the Dark Palace.\nFive Sovereigns and Ladies,\neach guarding their maternal position.\nThe Red Child flies in,\nthe Infant arrives in accomplishment.\nRevolving yin’s triple union,\nlight and mystery pervading the ten thousand directions.\nHarmonizing the hun and restraining the po,\nthe five wombs flowing freely.\nRiding the rosy clouds and flying essence,\nsoaring in emptiness to the east—\ncrown knotted in numinous clouds,\nrosy blossoms summoning the wind.\nLeft girded with the Dragon Talisman,\nright cinched with the Tiger Seal,\nvermilion cloak of phoenix plumes,\njade pendants and golden earrings.\nThe soaring tree knotted in the heights,\ncalled the Wood King—\nspirit’s luxuriance controlling the root,\nnow waning, now full.\nBright essence inwardly radiant,\ndark water spouting the beam.\nBestowed the Jade Tablet’s script,\nname carved in the Numinous Chamber.\nIngesting the moon’s blossom,\nuniting with the Perfected in harmony,\nflying transcendent of the Purple Culmen,\nascending to pay court to the Great Sovereign.\n\nProstrate twice. If the sky is overcast, this may be practiced within the bedchamber. Perform this at dawn and dusk in mountain forests without fail.\n\n**Method for Restraining the Three Hun**\nAt dusk, lie down without a pillow, stretch the feet upward, cross the hands over the heart, close the eyes, and hold the breath for three cycles. Strike the teeth three times, and visualize a crimson qi like a chicken’s egg rising from within, ascending through the eyes, then expanding to envelop the body in flame, burning both within and without until all is pervaded as one. When the body feels slightly warm, strike the teeth three times and urgently summon the three spirits: *Shuang Ling*, *Tai Guang*, and *You Jing*. Then softly intone:\n*Within the Mystic Palace of the Great Tenuity, the Primordial Yellow and First Azure refine the three hun. May Tai Guang rest in tranquility. The divine treasure of the Jade Chamber is born with me. Let them not stir recklessly, for the Great Numinous watches over. Should they desire to soar, they may only ascend to the Supreme Clarity of the Great Ultimate. Should they hunger or thirst, they may only drink the jade essence of the returning waters.*\n\n**Method for Restraining the Seven Po**\nAt dusk, lie down with feet stretched upward, cover both ears with the palms, and let the fingertips meet at the nape. Close the eyes, hold the breath seven times, and strike the teeth seven times. Visualize a white qi like a small bean at the tip of the nose, gradually expanding to crown the body in nine layers, each transforming into celestial beasts. Two azure dragons dwell within the eyes, two white tigers within the nostrils, all facing inward. The vermilion sparrow rests upon the heart, its beak toward the mouth. The dark tortoise lies beneath the left foot, the numinous serpent beneath the right, their necks also turned upward. A jade maiden clad in black brocade holds flames of fire at each ear. After a long while, swallow saliva seven times, strike the teeth seven times, and summon the seven po: *Shi Gou*, *Fu Shi*, *Que Yin*, *Tun Zei*, *Fei Du*, *Chu Hui*, and *Chou Fei*. Then softly intone:\n*Nine cycles of pristine qi restrain the po and repel treachery. Celestial beasts guard the gates, the maidens hold the passes. Refine the po to harmony, that they may rest with me. Let them not stir recklessly, for they are watched over in their forms. Should they hunger or thirst, they may only drink the yellow of the moon and the cinnabar of the sun.*\n\n**#2**\nBefore retiring at night, first visualize the *Red Child* in the *Mud-Pill Palace*, whose name is *San Yuan Xian*, also called *Di Qing*, clad in red. The *Perfected One of the Crimson Palace* is named *Zi Nan Dan*, also called *Zhong Guang Jian*, clad in red. The *Infant Brother of the Cinnabar Field* is named *Yuan Yang Zi*, also called *Gu Xia Xuan*, clad in yellow. In all, six persons.\n\nHead like that of an infant, with a radiance of gold and jade. Then visualize the *Great Lord of the Life Gate and Mysterious Portal within the Palace of Generation* at the navel’s *Mingmen*, clad in crimson, wearing a purple lotus crown, holding the *Celestial August Symbol Talisman*, seated facing outward. The three *hun* spirits attend at his side. Then hold the breath for twenty-four cycles, and silently invoke *Tao Hai*, whose name is *He Yan*, three times. Swallow saliva fifty times, and strike the teeth three rounds. Softly intone:\n\n*Great Womb Spirit, August Celestial Lord of the Imperial Net, holding the Embryo Talisman, head crowned with purple, yellow revolving and red turning, ascending to refine the Life Gate, transforming spirit to rebirth. The Six Harmonies intermingle, the bodily frame gleams with luster, and Jade Maidens attend the body.*\n\nFirst visualize this, then summon and restrain the *hun*. Further, on the nights of the new and full moon at midnight, write the *Celestial August Symbol Talisman* in cinnabar on blue paper. Facing north, hold the talisman in the left hand, hold the breath, and silently intone:\n\n*Celestial Emperor’s Mysterious Writ, August Symbol Talisman, uniting with primordial qi, circulating essence to return to the womb. Infant of ten thousand years, flying immortal at the Celestial Pivot, Great Spirit of the Palace of Generation, robed in cinnabar and crimson, head crowned with purple lotus, conspire with me.*\n\nAfter ingesting it, bow twice. Simply ingest it upon the bed where you sleep.\n\nAfter eighteen years of ordered practice and recorded affairs, one rides the Three Radiant Essences and soars through the Great Void.\n\n*Here ends the first scroll of* The Hand-Clasp Oral Instructions of the Highest Clarity. *(Note: The original text has minor lacunae. The base text did not originally contain the words “Lacuna Noted”; the collator added them based on the content.)*\n\n*The Hand-Clasp Oral Instructions of the Highest Clarity, Second Scroll*\n\n**Method for Guarding the Mysterious Elixir**\nOn the first, third, seventh, eleventh, and fifteenth nights of the month at midnight, the visualization follows the same method as that for the Three Ones. On ordinary days and evenings, proceed according to the present instructions.\n\nAt dusk, in tranquil repose, dispel all thoughts. First visualize the Northern Culmen star, from which a purple qi emerges like a bowstring, descending to enter the Palace of the Mysterious Elixir. Soon the palace fills and overflows, encircling the body and merging completely with the purple qi. Then visualize the sun suddenly flying in to enter the palace, gleaming brilliantly within the purple qi. Next visualize the Highest Clarity’s Central Yellow Supreme One Perfected Lord emerging from the Northern Culmen’s purple qi to sit within the sun. His attire, colors, name, and implements are all as before. Call his title and name three times. Suddenly visualize yourself stepping before the Supreme One, bowing twice with head touching the ground, and seeking the Dao to attain immortality. Then swallow the purple qi thirty times and the saliva thirty times.\n\nNext visualize the Dipper’s *Kui* asterism emitting a red qi like a bowstring, which enters the Palace of the Mysterious Elixir. Thereupon, the Perfected Lord and you together mount the sun and travel within the red qi’s path, ascending to rest within the *Kui*. Focus the visualization clearly, then lie down to sleep, and true resonance will occur.\n\nAt times other than evening, simply visualize the Supreme One in the Palace of the Mysterious Elixir, with purple qi emerging to encircle the body, and swallow it. If you hear ringing in the ears, cover them with crossed hands and intone:\n\n*The Red Child dwells in the palace, the Nine Perfected in the chamber. Hearken to the divine command, discern inauspicious omens. The Supreme One’s flowing fire overawes the ten thousand evils.*\n\nPoint to the ear’s gate seven times. If the face feels warm, it is auspicious. If the nape grows cold in patches, evil qi has entered. Immediately lie down, close the eyes, and visualize the Supreme One of the Mysterious Elixir wielding a fiery bell to cast it out, expelling the evil qi beyond the ears. The firelight will follow, blazing brightly to illuminate the entire body. After a long while, equilibrium will return.\n\nFor all inauspicious sights and sounds, concentrate on visualizing the Perfected Lord to seek deliverance and protection, and the ten thousand evils will not intrude.\n\n**Method of Great Stillness**\nThose who guard the One, on *jia-wu*, *jia-chen*, and *jia-yin* days at midnight, sweep and purify the courtyard of their tranquil chamber. Alternatively, construct an altar one *zhang* square, screen its four sides, lay out mats, burn incense, face north, bow twice, sit upright with hands clasped, close the eyes, and visualize the Three Palaces and Three Ones as prescribed.\n\nNext visualize the Three Radiant Cloud Qi, each within its palace, with the Three Persons seated within the qi. The Three Radiant Ones wear purple, cyan, and crimson robes, layered in deep obscurity. Then gaze upward at the Northern Dipper and visualize purple qi emerging from the *Kui* like a straight bowstring, entering the mouth and dispersing into the Three Palaces. Thereupon, the Three Ones, the Three Ministers, and you suddenly emerge, together mounting the purple qi to ascend into the Dipper’s *Kui*. Then, riding the Three Radiant Essences, traverse into the Northern Culmen, where you behold the Purple Chambers, Jade Stairs, and celestial officials in ordered ranks. The Supreme One Perfected Lord, crowned with a purple dawn cap and clad in dragon-embroidered phoenix robes, sits facing south. You and the six others ascend the stairs, face north, bow, and entreat the Way of flying transcendence and long life. After a long while, you forget yourself as if dwelling in heaven for ages, then quietly rise and return to your chamber. On rainy days, perform the visualization while lying in bed.\n\nOn *shang-jian* days at dawn, face due east, sit upright, hold the breath, close the eyes, and inwardly visualize the Three Palaces, Three Ones, and Three Ministers as prescribed. Then visualize them suddenly emerging to sit before you. Rise in your heart and bow twice to each, making them appear vividly. Then silently intone:\n\n*Celestial Honored Three Emperors, guard my Gate of Destiny. Roam the Void, where the Six Qi mystically divide. Nourish my Five Spirits, rectify my Three *Hun*. Let my Five Viscera spontaneously flourish, that I may attain long life and fly as an immortal.*\n\nNext visualize them suddenly returning from the Void to the Three Palaces, where they remain as prescribed. Then swallow saliva thirty times. With prolonged practice, you will dream of gold, jade, white crows, and other objects—signs of gradual attainment of the One.\n\nOn *shang-chu* days at midnight, rise quietly, face north, and gaze upward at the Dipper’s inner image, the forms of the Assistant and Minister stars. Suddenly visualize the Three Ones and Three Ministers emerging from the Assistant Star to descend into the Three Palaces. Return to your chamber, hold the breath, close the eyes, and inwardly visualize with focused concentration as prescribed. After a long while, softly intone:\n\n*Supreme Celestial Assistant, realm where the Three Emperors roam, the Three Ministers follow in attendance, uniting with the Perfected. Descend into my body, sit in tranquil stillness. Exhale essence to bathe my form, harmonizing *hun* and *po*. Let me fly as an immortal, riding a cloud chariot in the floating heavens.*\n\nSwallow saliva twenty-seven times.\n\nOn *kai* days at midnight, rise and sit facing east. Remove your headcloth—you may also loosen your hair, comb it, and tie it again. Close the eyes, inwardly visualize, and softly call:\n\n*Three Perfected of the Upper Prime, Infant within the Perfected. Dishevel the hair, open the mist, ascend to connect with the Celestial Terrace. Solidify the Mud-Pill, congeal it to be coeval with heaven. Let me fly as an immortal, traversing the Terrace of Intermingling.*\n\nSwallow saliva nineteen times, then don your headcloth and lie down. Further visualize the Three Ones in their palaces exhaling qi thirty times, and you also exhale qi thirty times. You should feel a warm, gentle heat suffusing your body—this is the sign of harmonized *po* and congealed *hun*.\n\nWhen the moon first appears, face it and bow twice. Visualize the moon’s white light with ten rays descending to embrace your body, penetrating and illuminating the Three Palaces. Silently intone:\n\n*Mysterious Essence of the Great Yin, Radiant Moon Lady, newly born flowing light, illuminate my Three Palaces. Let the divine immortals ascend and fly, roaming the eight directions. Wherever I turn, wherever I wish, may all be enveloped in blessing.*\n\nYou may also bow twice.\n\nBefore eating, first compose the mind. Close the eyes and visualize the Three Ones in their palaces, joining from afar to partake in the offering. Only then begin to eat.\n\nAfter eating, silently intone:\n\n*May the hundred grains enter the stomach,\nunite with the spirits in qi,\nfill and replenish blood and fluids.\nMay the corpse-demons and malevolent forces perish and fall away.\nMay I endure as long as heaven and earth,\nascend in flight to the Jade Towers,\ncommand the Six Dings,\nand be attended and guarded by divine youths.*\n\nWhen guarding the One at the Central Dipper to repel evil,\nwhether going out, entering, walking, or standing still,\nalways visualize the Northern Dipper covering your head,\nits handle pointing forward,\nwith the Celestial Pass seven feet from your face.\nThus, no hundred evils or baleful qi dare invade.\n\nFollowing this essential formula,\none may also recite while pacing the Flying Steps:\n\n*I am the Heavenly Eye,\npursuing the heavens.\nMy essence swift as lightning and thunder,\nradiant across the eight domains.\nPiercing sight within and without—\nnothing does not submit.*\n\nRefining the Form with Fire:\nAt night, face the fire, draw in its light through the mouth,\nand swallow it without count.\nVisualize your body enveloped,\npermeated as if by fire.\nAfter a long while, cease.\nPracticed for three years, one may sit within fire.\n\nThis is the Red General Zi’s method of refining the form.\n\nFacing the Primordial Simplicity:\nOn the ninth day of the first month,\neighth day of the second month,\nseventh day of the third month,\nsixth day of the fourth month,\nfifth day of the fifth month,\nfourth day of the sixth month,\nthird day of the seventh month,\nsecond day of the eighth month,\nfirst day of the ninth month,\ntenth day of the tenth month,\neleventh day of the eleventh month,\nand twelfth day of the twelfth month,\nat night in a quiet chamber,\nface north and bow twice.\nKneel, press the forehead to the ground, and say:\n\n*With reverence, I invoke the Supreme Great Dao,\nthe Lofty Void, the Jade Dawn,\nthe Purple Palace of Primordial Simplicity,\nthe Eight Numinous Lords of the Three Origins,\nthe Central Yellow Elder, the Primordial Radiance of White Origin,\nthe Five Elders of the Supreme Perfected, the Highest Immortals,\nthe Three August Jade Lords of the Great Ultimate Yellow Essence.\nI, disciple [Name], of the Great Cavern’s Three Luminants,\non this night of the announced day,\nwhen the Celestial Pass opens ninefold,\ndo humbly address the Supreme Jade Sovereign of the Most High,\nentreating long life in the world,\nlongevity without bound,\nto ride at times the Yellow Dawn’s green-canopied dragon chariot,\nascend to the Purple Courts above,\ncommand the myriad spirits,\nand be attended by the Four Luminaries.*\n\nWhen finished, let no one know.\n\nIt is said that practicing the Hidden Writ of the Great Cinnabar\nand visualizing the Three Origins’ Cavern Chambers\npertains to the methods of prior advancement,\nnot the Way of the Three Ones,\nbut among the various formulas.\n\nIf one has not yet walked this path,\nthis supplication should not be employed,\nthough these days are auspicious within the lunar cycle.\nThey are fitting for all manner of virtuous deeds.\n\nAt the dawn of the Jade Dawn’s mornings—\non the fourth day of the first month,\nthe eighth of the second,\nthe fifteenth of the third,\nthe eighth of the fourth,\nthe ninth of the fifth,\nthe sixth of the sixth,\nthe seventh of the seventh,\nthe eighth of the eighth,\nthe ninth of the ninth,\nthe fifth of the tenth,\nthe third of the eleventh,\nand the twelfth of the twelfth—\nat sunrise, face north and bow twice.\nDeclare your original intent and state your wishes,\nthen swallow saliva thirty-six times.\n\nIt is said that on these days,\nthe Supreme Great Dao’s Jade Dawn Lord\nascends to the Jade Firmament’s Jasper Chambers,\ncasting his gaze upon the world\nto observe those with lofty aspirations and far-reaching resolve.\nThus, he commands that supplications be made.\n\nFirst, invoke your title and name as in the audience rites,\nsaying, *“This humble dust-mote, so-and-so, entreats...”* and state your plea.\n\nIf rain or snow falls, perform the invocation in a quiet chamber,\nthen bow twice more,\nand remain kneeling to swallow saliva until finished.\n\n**Audience with the Azure Lord**\nOn *dingmao* days, at sunrise,\nface the sun and bow twice to make your entreaty.\nFrom the ninth month to the first month of the following year,\nface the direction of sunrise.\nUse this occasion to absorb the sun’s essence.\n\nOn these days, the Azure Youth of the Eastern Sea\nascends to the Eastern Florescence Terrace of Square Cauldron Mountain\nand surveys the four quarters.\n(Note: Square Cauldron lies east of Kuaiji,\nslightly to the south—\nwhen facing it, one aligns with the *yi* direction.)\n\nIn summer, when the sun rises in the northeast,\ndo not face it directly.\nInstead, visualize the location of the Eastern Florescence Terrace\nand make your invocation there.\n\nAfter the entreaty, bow twice again,\nthen proceed with solar practices.\nThe recipient need only inhale the radiant essence,\nswallowing nine times.\n\n**Intensive Visualization**\nRegularly on the second day of the second month,\nthe third of the third,\nthe eighth of the eighth,\nthe ninth of the ninth,\nand the tenth of the tenth,\nat night in your bedchamber,\nengage in the Cavern Chamber visualization practices,\nburn incense, invoke the Perfected,\nand remain vigilant without sleep.\nAs if awaiting something, exercise utmost caution,\nand on these days, redouble your virtuous deeds.\n\nIt is said that those who cultivate the Cavern Chamber methods\nare observed on these days by the Jade Lads and Maidens of the Protective Scriptures,\naccompanied by the Perfected of the Great Ultimate’s Canonical Prohibitions,\nwho descend from the void to inspect good and evil.\nThus, one must be circumspect,\nrefraining from all other affairs\nand devoting oneself solely to Daoist practices\nand the cultivation of virtuous dharmas.\n\n**Ominous Dreams**\n\nUpon awakening from an ominous dream, press the philtrum with the left hand thirty-four times, and gently gnash the teeth thirty-four times. Whisper the following incantation:\n\n*\"Great Cavern, True Mystery—\nZhang refines the Three Hun.\nThe First Hun swiftly guards the Po,\nthe Second Hun swiftly guards the Mud-Pill Palace,\nthe Third Hun obeys the heart’s command.\nHasten to summon the Supreme Lords of the Three Origins.\nI have encountered an inauspicious dream:\nthe Seven Po, wandering corpse-spirits, have come to cling to the source of evil.\nSwiftly call upon Peach-Kang to shield my life,\ndissolve the malign fluids,\ntransform misfortune into fortune,\nand preserve the primal bond of life and death.\"*\n\nWhen finished, lie down again, and a favorable response will surely come.\n\nIt is said that those who frequently encounter ominous dreams do so for three reasons: first, the Po’s demonic influence; second, the heart’s trial; third, the corpse-thief’s plunder. Thus, by dispelling and dissolving these, one seals the Three Passes below, turning misfortune into fortune.\n\n**Auspicious Dreams**\nUpon awakening from an auspicious dream, rub the eyes thirty-four times, gnash the teeth thirty-four times, and whisper the following incantation:\n\n*\"Supreme High Essence,\nThree Emperors of Cinnabar Spirit,\nthe Crimson Palace radiant and clear—\nauspicious omens declare their message.\nThe Three Origins soften the Po,\nthe Heavenly Sovereign bestows the scripture.\nAll I pursue harmonizes,\nI ascend as an immortal to the Upper Clarity,\never in the company of Jade Perfected,\ntogether we gather in the Purple Court.\"*\n\nThese incantations for auspicious and ominous dreams derive from the affairs of the Great Cinnabar Cavern Chamber. If one has not received this scripture, it is improper to perform these rites or make petitions while reciting them.\n\nWhen troubled by an ominous dream, at dawn one should invoke the Supreme, rectify the Hun and Po, and dispel inauspiciousness. Face the direction of the sunrise, bow in reverence, and petition for absolution. Place a musk sachet at the neck to repel the qi of water infusions and banish ominous dreams.\n\nIf one frequently dreams of tombs or the deceased, upon awakening, face upward and gnash the teeth three times, then whisper this incantation:\n\n*\"Supreme Origin, Upper Mystery,\nNine Capitals of the Purple Heaven—\ngovern the Hun, protect my life,\nLofty Plain Perfected.\nI have received the supreme method,\ntaught by the Great Mystery.\nLong life and enduring vision,\nspirit soars, body becomes immortal.\nTombs forever at peace,\nghostly disputes and treachery sealed.\nHun and Po harmonious and joyful,\nmalign qi vanishes like smoke.\nWandering demons, do not covet;\nspecters, dare not assail my spirit.\nThe Northern Emperor commands,\nseize the qi and cast it into the abyss.\nReceive the register of the Supreme August,\nreport to the Jade Dawn.\"*\n\nRecite this twice, and with each recitation, gnash the teeth three times. This is the Northern Emperor’s secret incantation. For all ominous and inauspicious dreams, one may apply this method. Those with sincere intent may also practice it.\n\nUpon awakening at night, swiftly close the eyes, gnash the teeth nine times, and swallow saliva nine times. Then, with the hands, press along the sides of the nose, moving up and down dozens of times, and whisper:\n\n*\"Supreme Four Luminaries,\nNine Gates emit essence.\nEars and eyes profoundly clear,\ncommuning with the true, reaching the numinous.\nPavilion of Heaven’s Center,\nflowing qi harmonized and balanced.\nMaiden Jiao with cloud-like bearing,\neyes of the youth bright and keen.\nFlourishing wisdom, resplendent clarity,\nall senses refined and pure.\nPreserve harmony in the Upper Origin,\nwander through the Nine Citadels.\nThe Five Viscera plant their roots,\nears and eyes naturally thrive.\nThe Heavenly Terrace, lofty and plain,\npillars and beams stand firm.\nThe Seven Po refined and tempered,\nthe Three Hun at peace.\nThe Red Child carries the radiance,\never at my side.\nShould any dare obscure my ears and eyes,\nthe Supreme shall crush them with flowing bells.\nAll myriad misfortunes vanish,\nevery wish shall be fulfilled.\nSun and Moon guard the gates,\nthe heart stores the Five Stars.\nAs the True Sovereign has invoked,\nlet all echoes heed with reverence.\"*\n\nWhen finished, swallow saliva nine more times, and rub the face until it is slightly warm. Make this a regular practice. Upon every awakening, perform this pressing and incantation without fail.\n\nIt is said that this is the Way the Perfected conduct themselves in daily life. Practicing it constantly, whether sitting or lying down, sharpens the ears and eyes, restores a youthful complexion, governs the Hun, refines the Po, and repels a thousand demons.\n\nUpon awakening at night, visualize the solar image within, swiftly grasp it in the palm, and cause the sun’s red rays to flow backward from the arm to the elbow and armpit. After a long while, the solar rays suddenly transform into fire, burning the arm until it is thoroughly permeated inside and out. Then, inaudibly recite:\n\n*\"Four Luminaries of the Upper Origin,\nqi of the Sun and Moon divide.\nFlowing light radiant and bright,\nirrigating the fluids, congealing the Hun.\nDivine fire scatters the radiance,\nscouring filth, refining smoke.\nThoroughly penetrating the wind and qi,\nall evil burns away.\nMay I attain long life,\nmy four limbs whole and sound.\nMalignant ghosts that inflict harm,\nconsign them to the Northern Asterism.\"*\n\nAfterward, engage in visualization for a long while, then relax the body and forget the self.\n\nIt is said that those afflicted with wind in the hands should practice this. For wind qi in the head, face, or other areas, apply this method to the respective location and burn with visualization while reciting the incantation.\n\nAt the time of living qi, swallow saliva thirty-four times, and press the afflicted area of the body. Face the direction of the ruler and recite:\n\n*\"Left Mystery, Right Mystery,\nThree Spirits unite as one.\nLeft Yellow, Right Yellow,\nSix Floras align.\nWind qi and ghostly ailments,\nsubdue and conceal in the four directions.\nJade fluid flows with moisture,\nup and down freely circulating.\nInternally dispatch water and fire,\nexternally repel inauspiciousness.\nLong life and flying immortality,\nthe body ever strong and at ease.\"*\n\nWhen finished, swallow saliva twenty-seven more times. Practicing this regularly will ensure freedom from illness.\n\nFor acute pain, press the afflicted area thirty-one times in rapid succession. When the pain flares, press swiftly while reciting the incantation, repeating this several times before ceasing. The painful spot need not be precisely located.\n\nFor numbness or immobility in the arms, first gently massage the afflicted limb with one hand for a long while. Then, with eyes closed, inwardly visualize, click the teeth, and swallow saliva three times. Compose the mind and softly recite:\n\n*\"Supreme Four Mysteries,\nFive Floras and Six Courts,\nThree Hun and Seven Po,\nCelestial Pass and Earthly Essence,\nDivine Palaces and Protective Qi,\nRadiance of the Heavenly Terrace,\nHundred Spirits of the Four Limbs,\nMyriad Spirits of the Nine Joints,\nReceive the Jade Dawn Register,\nInscribed in the Five Cities,\nJade Maidens attend my body,\nJade Lads guard my life,\nForever aligned with the Two Luminaries,\nAscending as an Immortal to the Upper Clarity,\nAgeless as the sun and moon,\nTranscending to ascend as a Perfected One,\nAttaining Great Peace.\nFlowing winds and congealed ailments,\nPossessing ghosts and flying demons,\nSpecters and tomb qi,\nYin qi assailing me,\nEncircling my limbs,\nThreatening my flourishing and decline—\nCelestial Soldiers of the Supreme,\nDragon and Tiger manifest their might,\nSlaying ghosts and inauspiciousness,\nCrushing wind and evil.\nExamine and suppress hidden grievances,\nConcealed poisons and falsehoods,\nRestore me to my normal state,\nRadiant as the sun and moon.\nIf examined and violated,\nThe Northern Asterism shall seize and destroy,\nAs though defying the luminous might.\"*\n\nThis is the Northern Emperor’s Curved Incantation. For all afflictions of a similar nature, employ this method. If unable to press the area oneself, have another do so while you inwardly visualize, swallow saliva, click the teeth, and recite. Practicing this a hundred times will dissolve the ailment.\n\nBefore sleeping at night, first close the eyes tightly and face east. With the thumbs behind the palms, press and wipe the eyes toward the ears, crossing the hands to meet at the nape thirty-nine times. Visualize three colored qi—purple, azure, and crimson—emerging from each eye. Then recite in silence:\n\n*\"Eye Lads of the Three Clouds,\nTrue Lords of the Two Eyes,\nBrilliant and luminous, infusing essence,\nOpening and clarifying the pure spirit,\nCloudy Splendor of the Great Mystery,\nSpiritual maidens fluttering,\nSafeguarding the twin gates,\nUnsealing the nine portals,\nHundred joints resonating,\nMorning saliva ascending to the Mud-Pill Palace,\nBody ascending to the Jade Palace,\nEnnobled as an Upper Perfected One.\"*\n\nWhen finished, swallow saliva fifty times, then open the eyes. This may be practiced regularly upon sitting or rising, not only at night, though it is best performed during the time of living qi. Practicing this for a year will clarify hearing and vision. With prolonged practice, one may perceive a thousand miles and behold the radiance of spirits. Thus, it need not be confined to night; from midnight until noon, whenever there is leisure, perform it—always facing east.\n\nAt midday, swallow saliva twenty-seven times and press the Celestial Perfection point, located at the inner corners of the eyebrows. For the Mountain Source, press the philtrum just below the nose. For the Flowery Court, press the hollows beneath the eyebrows. Press each thirty-nine times while reciting:\n\n*\"Open the Celestial Court,\nGrant me long life,\nPerceive ten thousand miles,\nHun and Po return as infants,\nExtinguish ghosts and repel demons,\nSummon a thousand spirits,\nAscend to the Supreme,\nMerge with the sun,\nAttain the rank of Perfected One,\nInscribed in the Mysterious Register.\"*\n\nThis enables spiritual perception and repels all evil. The points may be pressed sequentially or simultaneously while reciting. Regularly press the small cavities behind the eyebrows thirty-nine times. Rub the area beneath the eyes and above the cheekbones with the palms and fingers. Rotate the ears thirty times, then reverse the motion, sweeping the forehead thirty-nine times from the midpoint of the brows upward into the hairline. Swallow saliva freely, without count. With both hands, stroke the head in all directions, smoothing the hair and tying it securely—do this frequently. When finished, press the corners of the eyes eighteen times until light is clearly perceived. Practice diligently, without fixed times or limits. After a year, one may write in the dark; with prolonged practice, one may perceive a hundred spirits. This method derives from the *Supreme Treasure Spirit Scripture*, and even Perfected Ones do not abandon it. Practice it whenever leisure permits, without restriction.\n\nBefore sleeping and upon rising, rub the hands until warm, then wipe the neck, ears, and their surroundings until gently heated. Stroke the head in the direction of the hair, then rub the palms to treat the face and eyes. First, rub the palms vigorously until hot, then wipe the face. Stroke the hair toward the nape, alternating hands. When finished, swallow saliva thirty times.\n\nUpon rising, sit upright and compose the breath. First clasp the hands, then raise them to cover the nape. Tilt the head back, straining the neck against the hands three or four times. Flex and extend the body, stretching the limbs to their utmost, arching backward and twisting to the sides, mobilizing all joints—repeat each movement three times. This is the Essence-Light Massage Method, harmonizing essence and blood, preventing the intrusion of wind qi. With prolonged practice, one will neither die nor fall ill.\n\nRegularly press the inner corners of the eyes near the nose while holding the breath; cease when qi flows smoothly, then exhale and begin anew. With persistent practice, the eyes will attain penetrating vision. Frequently press and rub the ears on both sides, without count. Do the same for the nose. Often cover the mouth and nose with the hands, close the eyes, and gently breathe. Over time, saliva will form in the palms; use it to rub the face and eyes, imparting fragrance to the body.\n\nWhen sitting, often close the eyes and inwardly visualize the five viscera and intestines. With prolonged practice, they will become distinctly clear. When lying down, close the eyes, relax the body, and breathe softly. Inwardly gaze and listen to the four directions, extending perception to a thousand miles. With focused intent, one may perceive events a hundred miles away and hear the sounds of metal, stone, silk, and bamboo. Though initially indistinct, with time and sincerity, one will naturally attain mastery. Begin by focusing on one direction, progressing from near to far—hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of miles—then shift to another direction, encompassing all without obstruction.\n\nWhen combing the hair, face the direction of the kingly earth. At the beginning of combing, softly recite the incantation: *\"Mud Pill’s mysterious blossom, preserve essence and ensure its longevity. On the right lies the hidden moon, on the left the root of the sun. The six harmonies refine the essence, and the ten thousand spirits receive grace.\"* Upon completion, swallow saliva three times.\n\nWhen bathing, constantly visualize the Six Dings, and whatever one desires will come to pass. Each of the Six Dings corresponds to its respective cyclical period and should face its designated direction. One should bathe frequently—there is no harm in bathing often, only in one’s inability to do so. It washes away the stench of the corpse, allowing true qi to enter. On every *jiazi* day, one should bathe; if not, then at the beginning of each month, to enable spiritual communion.\n\nIf one treads upon filth or any unclean place, one should wash and bathe to purify the body and dispel impurities. The method involves ten liang of bamboo leaves and four liang of peeled white peach bark, boiled in one *hu* and two *dou* of clear water until it reaches a single boil. Adjust the temperature and bathe the body, and all impurities will vanish. While bathing is most effective, this water should not be used for washing the hair. Instead, use the pure essence of refined water for bathing. If one must wash the hair, follow the usual method separately.\n\nIt is also said that among worldly talismanic waters, none compare to this method when used for rinsing the mouth or holding in the mouth. There are also other talismanic water methods. Orthodox Unity Daoists have their own regular practices, while the Eight Officials and Six Jias possess a separate talismanic water superior for dispelling impurities. Here, it is appended for concurrent use.\n\nWrite in cinnabar on white paper, then place it in clear water while facing the kingly direction. Hold the water vessel in the left hand and a sword in the right. Strike the teeth three times, then spray the water while reciting: *\"Ghosts of the hundred impurities, swiftly depart ten thousand miles. If you do not leave, you will be slain. O White Youth of the West.\"* Strike the vessel’s edge with the sword three times, then recite and strike the teeth again, repeating this three times in total. Use the water to rinse the mouth, whether for oneself, another, or an unclean place, and the impurities will dissolve—no bathing is required.\n\nWhen ingesting immortal medicines, always face one’s life direction upon completion, and avoid speaking of death, mourning, or inauspicious matters to prevent harming the fetal spirit, rendering the medicine ineffective. Before eating, do not discuss death, nor leave food exposed, lest various malevolent qi gather. When eating, face one’s life direction or the kingly qi.\n\nDaoist methods and plain garments should not be lent to others, nor should carriages, clothing, beds, or bedding be shared. The chambers where one sits or sleeps should be kept clean and uncluttered to receive pure qi; if unclean, one will absorb stale qi. Stale qi disrupts the chambers, causing endeavors to fail and undertakings to falter. The body should also be frequently washed and bathed to remain pure; otherwise, immortality cannot be attained. Infrequent bathing is the nature of the *po*; to distance the *po* and return to the true, one refines its turbid filth, and the *po* will gradually vanish. Bathe often, constantly visualize the Six Dings, and whatever one desires will come to pass.\n\nBeware of discussing Daoist studies, for such talk invites ghostly interference. If one is unafraid, illness will swiftly follow, as the body has not yet attained authenticity. When transcribing scriptures, always burn incense on both sides. When deeply contemplating, burn incense nearby.\n\nImpatience and violence are thieves and illnesses of the body. In all matters, one should be gentle, unhurried, and thoroughly pure. Those who wish to study the Dao should never let others know what they have seen or heard; in all things, act with utmost discretion.\n\n**Method of Storing the Sun in the Heart**\nOn the fifth, fifteenth, and twenty-ninth days of the lunar month, at midnight, visualize the sun entering the mouth and residing in the heart, illuminating the heart’s interior. Merge with the sun’s light for a long while until the heart feels warm, then recite: *\"Great brightness nurtures essence, internally refining the cinnabar heart. Radiance converges and reflects, and divine perfected beings come seeking.\"* Swallow saliva nine times.\n\nIt is also said that this practice should be performed frequently, not strictly on these days, and may be done every night. This is the internal method of the Crimson Lord of the Great Void.\n\n**Method of Ingesting the Sun and Moon’s Forms**\nMen ingest the sun’s form, women the moon’s form, once daily without fail. It is said to write the characters for \"sun\" and \"moon\" and ingest them, though the time is not specified. Now, one may write the character for \"sun\" in cinnabar on blue paper, nine *fen* square, cut into thousands of pieces. Each dawn, face east, hold them in the left hand, visualize the sun’s form with its proper radiance, then swallow them, allowing them to reside in the heart. Strike the teeth and swallow saliva nine times each.\n\nWomen should write the moon’s form in yellow on yellow paper and ingest it with the right hand. This is the method of the Perfected One of Eastern Florescence.\n\n**Method of Ingesting the Sun’s Rays**\nThe true forms of the sun and moon are to be ingested separately, as recorded in the *Hidden Instructions*. Sit upright, close the eyes, and directly visualize the sun’s form within the heart, the size of a coin, crimson in color, with nine rays of purple light. It rises from the heart, passes through the throat, and reaches the teeth, then returns to the stomach. After a long while, clearly visualize the heart and stomach, then exhale, rinse the mouth with saliva, and swallow it thirty-nine times.\n\nPerform this three times a day: at dawn facing east, at noon facing south, and at dusk facing west.\n\n**Method of Ingesting the Moon’s Rays**\nAt night, visualize the moon in the Mud Pill Palace, yellow in color, with ten rays of white light. It also reaches the teeth but does not emerge, returning instead to the stomach. This should also be performed three times a night, during the *hai*, *zi*, and *chou* hours. The moon, one *cun* in diameter, resides in the Cinnabar Field Palace, its ten white rays flowing into the mouth, then swallowed into the throat and stomach, allowing the white light to illuminate everything. Exhale, swallow saliva thirty-nine times, and visualize while lying down.\n\nThis is the method of the Lord of Western City, transmitted from the Central Teachings of Eastern Florescence, enabling the sun and moon to constantly illuminate the body, causing ghostly and primal beings to conceal their forms. Unceasing practice ensures protection and the vision of Great Peace.\n\n**Method of Ingesting the Three Qi**\nDaily, face the sun, close the eyes, and visualize green qi, white qi, and red qi, each like a thread, descending from the sun into the mouth. Inhale them ninety times until satiated, then stop.\n\nWith each inhalation, swallow once, allowing the three qi to enter the viscera. They branch and flow through, permeating everything; once the count is complete, the qi subsides.\n\nThis method was first received by Fan Jian of Dongyang and You Zhong from the High Prime Lord’s *Inner Radiance of Grand Simplicity*. Its effects are rare yet easily verified.\n\n**Method of Ingesting Mist**\nAt dawn, within a quiet chamber, sit or lie as you wish. First close the eyes and inwardly visualize, faintly perceiving the five viscera. Then, facing the light, exhale through the mouth, emitting the five-colored qi twenty-four times, so that the eyes behold the five-colored qi intertwining and swirling before the face in a dense cloud. Next, inhale this five-colored qi through the mouth fifty times, then swallow saliva sixty times. Softly recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Great mist unfurls its radiance,\nSpirit-mist traverses the four directions,\nCoiling qi bends and twists,\nFive colors illuminate the cavern-heaven.\nDivine smoke converges and ascends,\nMetal and stone blossom with true essence.\nPurple emptiness gathers in lush abundance,\nRefining form to preserve its wholeness.\nEmerging from light, concealed in mystery,\nThe five numina transform and divide.\nConjoined brightness fans the void,\nRiding the six clouds in harmony,\nThey gather and shield my body,\nAscending to the Nine Heavens.\"*\n\nWhen finished, knock the teeth together seven times and swallow saliva seven times, then open the eyes.\n\nThis method was transmitted by the Mistress of the Enshrouded Terrace, the female perfected Zhang Weizi, as part of the Eastern Florescence teachings. Though it speaks of exhaling the viscera’s qi and is called \"ingesting mist,\" the twenty-four exhalations are the viscera’s qi, which then harmonize with the misty qi of Heaven and Earth to re-enter the body—hence the sudden intake of fifty breaths.\n\n**Method of Guarding the Mysterious and White**\nAt dawn, sit or lie as you wish. Visualize qi within the Mud-Pill Palace, white qi within the heart, and yellow qi within the navel. All three qi emerge like small beans, gradually growing larger, intertwining and merging into one to envelop the body. Then transform them into fire, which burns the body until inner and outer become as one, utterly luminous.\n\nContinue from dawn until midday, then ingest qi one hundred twenty times to conclude.\n\nThis method was received by Du Guangping from the *Black-White Inner Radiance of Embryonic Essence* within the *Central Teachings of Jie Yan*. It repels all harm and grants immortality. First, abstain from sexual intercourse and all meat, the five pungent flavors, and other impure foods. After thirty years of practice, one may conceal the body and vanish, traveling five hundred *li* in a day.\n\n**Method of Ingesting the Heart-Opening Talisman**\nOn the first day of the lunar cycle, the fifteenth, and the twenty-seventh, face the sun and write in cinnabar. Bow twice and recite the prayer:\n\n*\"Five spirits open the heart,\nPiercing hearing to sever sound.\nThree hun souls gather essence,\nFirmly guarding the cinnabar heart.\nLet me never forget,\nAs the five viscera roam afar.\"*\n\nWhen finished, ingest the talisman, then swallow saliva five times and knock the teeth together five times. Do not let others witness this.\n\nThis method was taught by the Perfected Lord, from the *Heart-Opening Talisman of the Bright Hall’s Inner Canon*. Write the talisman in cinnabar on white paper beforehand, preparing about ten copies. On each appointed day, hold the talisman in the left hand while bowing and ingesting it.\n\n**Great Exorcism Against Malevolence**\nWhenever traversing perilous paths, passing through ghostly shrines, or encountering doubtful and difficult places, first press the tongue inward, swallow saliva three times, and with the second and third fingers of the left hand, pinch the area below the nostrils at the inner edge of the diaphragm thirty-six times—counting silently without lifting the fingers.\n\nKnock the teeth together seven times, then press the palms over the nose. With eyes closed, softly recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Vermilion Bird soars through the heavens,\nDivine might inwardly expands.\nThe four mountain springs stand guard,\nGhostly essences flee in terror.\nThe spirit-pool exhales its qi,\nEvil roots cower and hide.\nThe soul-terrace shines with fourfold brightness,\nThe jade chamber resounds with tinkling jade.\nThe jade perfected stand majestic,\nSeated to guard the Bright Hall.\nHands wave purple auroras,\nHead crowned with dawn’s light.\nReciting the *Cavern Canon*,\nIts thirty-nine chapters:\nWithin dwell the exorcising dragon and tiger,\nSevering peaks and cleaving ridges.\nFierce beasts and stampeding oxen,\nClutching blades and devouring spears.\nUplifting mountains and tolling heaven,\nDivine birds and venomous dragons,\nSix-headed serpents spewing fire,\nDevourers of ghost-kings.\nLightning walls and thunder’s father,\nSeizing stars and streaming meteors.\nOwls and krakens ablaze,\nDefying winds to stride crosswise.\nCelestial birds arrayed in ranks,\nAll stand beside me,\nSpitting fire a myriad fathoms,\nTo dispel all misfortune.\nHosts of spirits clear the path,\nSealing and banishing mountain hamlets.\nA thousand gods and a hundred numina,\nAll clasp hands and bow their heads.\nMarshals and constables bear lamps,\nBurning incense for me.\nWherever I go,\nTen thousand spirits welcome and serve.\"*\n\nWhen finished, knock the teeth together three times, then open the eyes and remove the hands.\n\nThis comes from the *Highest Great Exorcism of the Grand Cavern*, summoning celestial beasts to guard and causing a thousand spirits to tremble and submit.\n\n**Fengdu Great Exorcism**\nFirst, with eyes closed, visualize the five viscera until fully present. Knock the teeth together thirty-six times, then recite the incantation, tapping the teeth once for every four words as a cadence:\n\n*\"Heavenly Vanguard, Heavenly Vanguard,\nNine Primes’ slayer of youths,\nFive Ding marshals, High Diao Northern Duke,\nSeven Governors, Eight Numinous Ones,\nGrand Supreme expels the fierce.\nLong-skulled giant beasts,\nHands grasping the Emperor’s bell.\nWhite owls, three spirits,\nSternly driving leviathan dragons.\nMighty-sword spirit-kings,\nSevering evil and erasing traces.\nPurple qi ascends the heavens,\nCinnabar auroras surge and clash.\nDevouring demons, consuming ghosts,\nBodies transverse to drink the wind.\nAzure tongues, green teeth,\nFour-eyed old men.\nHeavenly Ding warriors,\nMightily subduing the southern fierce.\nHeavenly couriers, fierce and keen,\nNorthern guardians biting blades.\nThree hundred thousand soldiers,\nEncircle me in ninefold ranks.\nRepelling corpses a thousand *li*,\nDispelling all misfortune.\nDare any petty ghost\nApproach to witness my form?\nHeaven’s great axe,\nSevering the five forms of ghosts.\nFlame Emperor rends their flesh,\nNorthern Dipper burns their bones.\nFour Brightnesses shatter their skeletons,\nHeavenly Strategy annihilates their kind.\nA single stroke of the divine blade—\nTen thousand ghosts scatter and dissolve.\"*\n\nWhen finished, if reciting during daylight or night, or when afflicted by illness, this becomes a perpetual exorcism.\n\nGhosts that hear this incantation thrice shall perish with rotting eyes. It is said this is the secret incantation of the Northern Emperor of Fengdu, wherein all names are those of offices that behead ghosts. Kept secret, it becomes efficacious. Those who obtain this incantation and recite it constantly tread the Way of Undying.\n\n**Six Palaces Incantation**\nWhen about to retire at dusk, first face north and softly recite:\n*\"I am a disciple of the Most High, governing the Six Celestial Palaces below. These are my domains—not merely mine, but those ruled by the Most High. I know the names of the Six Celestial Gates, and thus attain long life. Should any dare transgress, the Most High shall sever you.\"*\n\nFirst Palace: named the *Zhoujue Yintian Palace*;\nProceeding eastward, the Second Palace: named the *Dasha Liangshi Zongtian Palace*;\nThird Palace: named the *Mingchen Naifan Wucheng Tian Palace*;\nFourth Palace: named the *Tianzhao Zuinqi Tian Palace*;\nFifth Palace: named the *Zongling Qifei Tian Palace*;\nSixth Palace: named the *Gansi Lianwanlü Tian Palace*.\n\nConclude by clicking the teeth six times, then recite the incantation thrice more before resting, thus repelling all ghostly and pernicious qi. It is said that those who know the names of the Six Celestial Gates of Fengdu shall find no harm from the hundred ghosts.\n\n**Ode to Fengdu**\nXiang Liang of the city composed the *Ode to the Fengdu Palace*, saying:\n\nZhoujue marks the Dawn of Emperors,\nLiangshi meets the Lofty Ridge,\nFlaming like smoke in the clouds,\nSurging as radiance in bloom,\nWucheng girds the divine blade,\nTianzhao swallows the Azure River,\nChanghe overlooks the Cinnabar Well,\nCloud Gates rise in towering majesty,\nQifei links the wondrous canopy,\nLianwan spreads its demon-quelling might—\nThe Six Heavens bar the northern road,\nHere is the abode of ghosts and spirits.\n\nRecite these softly at night,\nand you shall repel all ghosts.\nThese are the names of the Six Palace Gates,\nand thus even ghosts fear them.\nWuyang and Wucheng are distinct,\nyet one may invoke them as needed.\nWhen traveling by night, click the teeth—\nno fixed number, but the sound slays ghosts,\nand wayward spirits ever dread the clicking of teeth.\nIf combined with rinsing the mouth and reciting incantations,\nthe effect is even better.\n\nThe Immortal’s method states:\nConstantly swallow saliva and click the teeth\nto make one grow younger.\nAmong worldly fools, fierce and stubborn ghosts\noften take the form of women\nto delude and test mortals.\nShould you encounter such,\nhold your breath,\nenvision the celestial pivot of Tian Guan,\nthe stars of Heng Fu,\nsummon your body’s spirits,\ncompose your countenance,\nsteady your will,\nand gaze intently at the pupils of their eyes.\nIf they appear dim and murky,\nit is a ghost’s test.\nSwiftly visualize the Seven Stars before your face—\nor above your head—to repel them.\nIt is fitting to use the Seven Stars’ Celestial Eye incantation,\nand to visualize the Cavern Chamber and Bright Hall,\nthe inverted arc of sun and moon,\nand the Perfected Lord Taiyi.\nYou may also invoke the Tianpeng and Vermilion Crow Palaces.\nIf the eyes are clear and upright,\nit is an immortal or Daoist adept—\nbow and entreat them.\nFailing to recognize the true\nis to fail the test.\nTo mistake the perverse for a Perfected One\nis also to fail the test.\nBe deeply cautious.\n\nWhen taking divine medicines,\ndo not face north toward Hai.\nOn the day of Zi, do not spit.\n—From the oral instructions of Shen Xi.\n\nDaoists should arrange their hair and attire,\nas well as their food, conduct, footwear, pillows, and bedding,\nso that those outside the Way do not see and violate them.\n—From the oral instructions of Chen Shian.\n\nWhen ingesting medicinal substances,\nespecially avoid garlic,\npomegranate seeds,\npork,\nand dog meat.\n—From the oral instructions of Lord Huang Yuan.\n\nWhen consuming elixirs,\ndo not eat anything containing blood,\nnor any meat,\nfor it ruins one’s progress.\n—From the oral instructions of Cheng Wei’s wife.\n\nThose seeking immortality\nshould avoid seeing corpses,\nexcept for parents and teachers—\none cannot but attend them in mourning.\n—From the oral instructions of Li Shaojun.\n\nThose seeking immortality\nshould not meet with women\non the third day of the third month,\nthe second day of the sixth month,\nthe sixth day of the ninth month,\nor the third day of the twelfth month.\nOn these days, the Three Worms of men and women\nemerge from their eyes,\nsummoning misfortune and harm to each other.\nAvoid entering their chambers—\nseclusion is best.\n—From the oral instructions of Liu Gang’s wife.\n\nThose seeking immortality\nshould not engage in sexual intercourse with women,\nfor each encounter drains a year’s potency of the elixir.\n—From the oral instructions of the Little Lad of the Eastern Sea.\n\nWhen a Daoist falls ill,\nclose your eyes and inwardly visualize the

Method for Conducting Affairs\n\nThe human head contains nine palaces. Three *fen* above the space between the eyebrows lies the *Shoucun* Palace. It has the Green Chamber and the Purple Portal, wherein two spirits reside. One *cun* above is the Bright Hall Palace, where the Luminous Youthful Perfected Official, the Luminous Mirror Spirit Lord, and the Luminous Female Perfected Official—three in all—reside. Two *cun* above is the Cavern Chamber Palace, where Wu Ying, Yellow Elder, and White Prime—three in all—reside. Three *cun* above is the Cinnabar Field and Mud-Pill Palace, where the Upper Prime Red Child and the Imperial Minister—two in all—reside. Four *cun* above is the Flowing Pearl Palace, where the Flowing Pearl Perfected Spirit resides. Five *cun* above is the Jade Emperor’s Palace, where the Jade Clarity Spirit Mother resides. One *cun* above the Bright Hall is the Heavenly Court Palace, where the Upper Clarity Perfected Maiden resides. One *cun* above the Cavern Chamber is the Ultimate Perfection Palace, where the Grand Ultimate Imperial Consort resides. One *cun* above the Cinnabar Field is the Mysterious Cinnabar Palace, where the Grand Unity Perfected Person resides. One *cun* above the Flowing Pearl is the Grand August Palace, where the Supreme Lord’s Queen resides.\n\nIn all, the head contains nine palaces, each one *cun* square. The Jade Emperor’s Palace, the Heavenly Court Palace, the Ultimate Perfection Palace, and the Grand August Palace are the four palaces of the feminine unity; their scriptures are transmitted only to those who have attained Perfection. The remaining five palaces have already circulated in the world, though the *Flowing Pearl Scripture* has not yet been seen.\n\nThe method of Guarding the One: On the midnight of the Beginning of Spring, sit facing east, close the breath, shut the eyes, clasp the fists upon the knees, and first visualize within the *Shoucun* Palace. On the left is the Crimson Terrace, within which is the Green Chamber, and in the chamber is a spirit clad in green robes, named Upright Heart, styled Cutting Square. On the right is the Yellow Gate, within which is the Purple Portal, and in the portal is a spirit clad in purple robes, named Tranquil Serenity, styled Dharma King. Both hold flowing golden bells. Call their names thrice and softly intone:\n\n“Purple Portal and Green Chamber,\nhome to two great spirits,\nhands grasping flowing bells,\nbodies seated upon wind and cloud,\nflanking and guarding the true Dao,\nbarring all that lies without.\nLet my thoughts and perceptions\nflow freely through the numinous gates,\nentering and exiting with integrity,\nascending through the nine portals,\nthat I may behold the Nine Perfected,\nthe honored ones of the Supreme.”\n\nNext, visualize within the Bright Hall Palace. On the left is the Luminous Youthful Perfected Official, named Mysterious Yang, styled Lesser Green. In the center is the Luminous Mirror Spirit Lord, named Illuminating Essence, styled Fourfold Brightness. On the right is the Luminous Female Perfected Official, named Subtle Yin, styled Lesser Prime. Their forms are all like those of infants, clad in green brocade robes, girdled with four crimson jade bells, mouths holding crimson jade mirrors. Kneeling upright and facing outward, they all exhale crimson *qi*, which envelops my body. Close the eyes and gently swallow it. Then make the jade bells ring, their sound reaching the Grand Ultimate. The mirrors emit crimson light ten thousand *zhang* long; in an instant, crimson *qi* coils about the body, transforming into fire that burns both within and without, merging light into one. Thereupon call their names thrice and click the teeth nine times.\n\nIf hungry or thirsty, visualize the three lords exhaling crimson *qi* into my mouth and inhale to swallow it. If walking in darkness, visualize the three lords emitting three beams of fire to illuminate the path ahead. If in peril or distress, also visualize the three lords ringing their jade bells, flashing and casting them forth.\n\nNext, visualize within the Cavern Chamber Palace. On the left is the Lord of No-Florescence, wearing a lotus-flower crown, bearing a purple dawn canopy, and girded with flowing golden bells. Seated facing outward, softly intone:\n\n“Three Primes’ flourishing *qi*,\nGrand Mystery’s purple dawn,\nYellow Gate and Golden Chamber,\nwithin dwell great spirits.\nLotus crown and purple canopy,\ndragon robes with tiger patterns,\nemerging from cinnabar, entering the void,\nsummoning yin and calling yang.\nThe Way of Heaven holds a truth,\nnamed No-Florescence.\nSupport me, give me life,\nand abide with me forever.”\n\nNext, visualize on the right the Lord of White Prime, wearing a yellow dawn-flower crown, dragon-patterned robes, and girded with the Spirit Tiger Talisman. Seated facing outward, softly intone:\n\n“Supreme divine essence,\nright at the Gate of Spirit,\ndragon robes and tiger sash,\nyellow dawn-flower crown.\nHolding registers and grasping scriptures,\nthis is White Prime.\nTravel with me,\nascend to the Yang Barrier,\nwander through the Nine Clarities,\nand return to rest in the Yellow Chamber.”\n\nThis is the method of the Cavern Chamber.\n\nFurthermore, regularly at the time of *qi*-generation after midnight, press the hands upon the knees, close the breath, shut the eyes, and inwardly gaze. Swallow saliva one hundred and twenty times, and visualize the Lord of No-Florescence, his attire and incantation as prescribed. Again, at sunrise, face east, bow twice, close the breath, shut the eyes, and inwardly gaze. Swallow saliva one hundred and twenty times, and visualize the Lord of White Prime, his attire and incantation as prescribed. Again, on the midnight after a *jiazi* day, let the hair down, apply powder, press the hands upon the knees, ingest *qi*, and swallow saliva one hundred and forty times. Then call the names of the two spirits. Listen inwardly for a response, as if someone answers, or for the sound of scripture recitation—this is the sign of resonance.\n\nAt the Beginning of Spring, face east; at the Beginning of Summer, face south; at the Beginning of Autumn, face west; at the Beginning of Winter, face north. On the midnight of the Spring Equinox, sit upright facing east, shut the eyes, and visualize the purple *qi* beneath the Northern Dipper, as thick as a bowstring, descending straight before me. Let the Three Ones, the Three Ministers, and myself—seven in all—with me at the center, all be enveloped. The handle of the Dipper’s seven stars points forward in a goose formation. Together we ride the purple *qi* upward to the Yang Brightness Star, enter, and sit together. All swallow the purple *qi* thirty times, then collectively inhale the green and purple *qi* descending from above, returning it to the Three Palaces. Focus the mind and visualize this, then intone:\n\n“Three honored Perfected Ones,\nlofty spirits of the Grand Mystery,\nYang Brightness governs spring,\nten thousand youths open the gates.\nCinnabar Prime governs summer,\ncrimson and purple merge in mist.\nYin Essence governs autumn,\nheavenly might in sixfold array.\nNorth Culmen governs winter,\nten thousand evils block and repel.\nFive Earths’ seasonal lords,\nthe celestial barriers of *wu* and *ji*.\nAll that they shatter is destroyed,\nall that they face is undefiled.\nRefine my seven *po*,\nharmonize my three *hun*,\nnurture my five viscera,\nthat I may attain the true.\nAscend and fly to the Upper Clarity,\nfloat upon the light of the Seven Primes.\nLive long and journey forth,\nwhistle and command a thousand spirits.”\n\nAt the Summer Solstice, face south and ascend the Cinnabar Prime Star;\n\nAt the Autumn Equinox, face west and ascend the Yin Essence Star; at the Winter Solstice, face north and ascend the North Culmen Star—all according to this method. On the first or fifteenth day of the sixth month, to avoid the Summer Solstice and Autumn Equinox, face southwest, together ride the crimson, purple, azure, and yellow *qi*, and ascend the Celestial Barrier Star, swallowing each of the four-colored *qi* ten times. Begin with crimson, then proceed in order. This is called the Inner Method of the Five Dipper Stars.\n\nOn each *jian* day at dawn, visualize the Three Ones emerging from the Three Palaces and sitting before you, as if truly seen. Then rise slightly, bow twice, and intone:\n\n“Heavenly Honored Three Emperors,\nguardians of the Gate of Destiny,\nroaming amidst the clouds,\nthe Six *Qi* in mysterious division.\nNurture my Five Spirits,\nrectify my Three *Hun*,\nlet my Five Viscera flourish of themselves,\nthat I may attain long life and ascend as a flying immortal.”\n\nThen visualize them returning from the void into the Three Palaces, and swallow saliva thirty times to conclude.\n\nAt midnight on the last day of the month, rise in secret and face north. Gaze up at the Northern Dipper, and visualize the Three Ones descending from the Auxiliary Star, each entering the Three Palaces within you. Then return to rest, silently visualize, and softly intone:\n\n“Supreme Heavenly Auxiliary,\nwhere the Three Emperors wander,\nthe Three Ministers in mutual support,\nunited with the Perfected.\nDescend into my body,\nsettle in tranquil stillness,\nexhale essence to bathe my form,\nharmonize *hun* and *po* in softness,\nthat I may ascend as a flying immortal,\nriding cloud chariots upon the floating light.”\n\nSwallow saliva twenty times.\n\nOn each *kai* day at midnight, rise and sit facing east. Remove your headscarf—you may also loosen and comb your hair—then recite.\n\nSoftly intone:\n\n“Supreme Three Perfected of the Upper Primordial,\nthe Infant within the Perfected,\ncompleting love to open the mist,\nascending to commune with Heavenly Terrace,\nthe *Niwan* palace firm and congealed,\ncoeval with Heaven itself—\ngrant that I may ascend as a flying immortal,\nexchanging steps upon the Terrace of Florescence.”\n\nSwallow saliva nineteen times, then don the headscarf and retire to rest.\n\nFurther visualize the Three Ones and the Three Ministers, each seated facing within their respective palaces. The Three Ones exhale qi thirty times, and I likewise exhale thirty times in turn.\n\nThis visualization on the *kai* day of the *jianchu* cycle follows the same method as before, proceeding in order from guarding the inch to completing the names of the Three Palaces. Then adhere fully to the entire practice.\n\nOn the days of *jia-wu*, *jia-chen*, and *jia-yin*, at midnight, go out to the courtyard altar. Spread a mat one *zhang* above the ground, burn incense, face north, bow twice, and sit with hands resting upon the knees. Gaze up at the Northern Dipper and visualize purple qi issuing forth from the Dipper, entering the Three Palaces within you. The Three Ones, the Three Ministers, and yourself all ascend upon the purple qi to the North Star, body dissolving in rapture as if mounting the bed of Heaven.\n\nBehold within the North Star the purple chambers and jade steps, the celestial officials arrayed in order—these seven attendants before the Emperor, seated in discourse on the Dao. Request the boon of flying immortality, and bow in reverence with the heart. Then return to rest.\n\nThe North Emperor is the Supreme One of the Upper Clarity; his separate chamber resides within the Great Ultimate.\n\nNext, face north and visualize within the Palace of the Mysterious Elixir a purple chamber and verdant chamber, suffused with crimson mist. There sits the Perfected Lord of the Great One, named *Guiying*, styled *Huaxuan*. His form is like that of an infant, clad in a purple embroidered brocade robe, a belt of flowing gold and fire-bells at his waist. In his left hand he holds the handle of the Northern Dipper, and in his right, the net of the North Star. He sits facing outward upon a golden bed within a jade canopy. Visualize him clearly.\n\nThen visualize the purple qi of the North Star descending into the palace, brimming over to envelop the body in a penetrating, all-pervading union. Further visualize the sun entering the palace, resting at the center of the purple qi, radiant and warm. Then visualize the Perfected Lord of the Great One descending from the purple qi of the North Star to sit within the sun. Suddenly ascend and sit facing him, bow twice with the heart, prostrate at his knees, and inquire of the Dao to seek immortality.\n\nThereupon swallow the purple qi thirty times and swallow saliva thirty times. Again visualize within the Northern Dipper a red qi like a bowstring, descending directly into the Three Palaces. The Great One and I then together mount the sun and ride the red qi to repose within the Dipper’s bowl. Then retire to rest.\n\nThis method may also be practiced alone, without awaiting the Three Ones.\n\nOn the first, third, seventh, eleventh, and fifteenth days of the month, at midnight, visualize the Perfected Lord of the Great One—his name, attire, and colors as before—seated facing outward. From his mouth issues forth blue-green qi, which enters your own mouth; swallow it fifty times. Swallow saliva fifty times and softly intone:\n\n“Supreme Perfected August One,\nPurple Lord of the Central August,\nwhose tabooed name is *Guiying*,\nwhose style is *Huaxuan*,\nseated upon a golden bed within a jade canopy,\nrobed in purple embroidered brocade,\ngirded with fire-bells,\nslaying demons and vanquishing treachery,\nholding the essence of the stars in hand,\nthe sun’s perfection crowning his head—\nrightly seated, he exhales qi,\ngranting that I may swallow and imbibe,\nconverse with me as a companion,\nfeast together in the Mysterious Elixir,\ntemper and bathe the seven *po*,\nharmonize and soften the three *hun*,\nspirits and numina attending in guard,\nthat I may ascend as a flying immortal,\nthe five viscera self-generating,\nrestoring the youthful countenance of a child,\nreceiving scriptures of the Upper Clarity,\nappointed as an official of the Lord of Destiny,\nall wishes and desires fulfilled,\na hundred blessings ever renewed.”\n\nVisualize yourself ascending into the palace to repose before the Great One. Then lie down to sleep.\n\nFor the practice of Guarding the One, rise each day and swallow saliva thirty times, visualizing it as crimson. Then rub your face and ears with your hands until warm. On days not designated for visualization, simply maintain the Three Ones seated peacefully within the Three Palaces. As for the Mysterious Palace, visualize often without neglect.\n\nShould you suddenly sense strange or foul sensations around your head and neck, it means malign qi has entered. Immediately lie down, close your eyes, and visualize the Great One of the Mysterious Elixir Palace, wielding a flowing fire-bell to cast it forth, driving the malign qi out through the ears. Let the fire’s radiance follow, illuminating your entire body until you fully recover.\n\nIf your ears suddenly ring, it signals other ghosts or malevolent spirits attempting entry. Guard the three spirits of the inch, summoning the ear spirits Jiao Nü and Yun Yi to sound the chime-bells in vigilance. Cross your hands to cover your ears and intone:\n“The Red Child dwells within the palace,\nthe Nine Perfected abide in the chamber.\nHearken to the divine command,\ndiscern all that is inauspicious.\nThe flowing fire of the Great One\nshall extinguish the ten thousand evils.”\nPoint your fingers to your ear gates seven times.\n\nBefore eating or drinking, first visualize the One partaking of the meal, then proceed to eat. Upon finishing, silently intone:\n“As the hundred grains enter my stomach,\nthey merge with the spirit’s qi,\nfilling and replenishing blood and fluids.\nThe corpse-demons and malevolence perish,\nI shall live as long as heaven and earth,\nascend to the Golden Towers,\ncommand the Six Dings,\nwith divine youths attending in guard.”\n\nRegularly face the newly risen moon and bow twice, silently intoning:\n“Dark essence of the Great Yin,\nLady of the Radiant Moon,\nas your nascent light streams forth,\nillumine my Three Palaces.\nMay I ascend as an immortal,\nsoaring high through the eight directions,\nwherever I turn, may fortune and divine favor abide.”\n\nOn the days of the Eight Nodes, inscribe the True Talismans of the Three Origins in cinnabar. At dawn, face the sun, consume one talisman, and bow twice. Offer prayers as your heart desires. Begin on the first day of the lunar month and cease on the sixteenth, resuming with the next node as before. Also inscribe on white silk, place it in a brocade pouch, and wear it upon your head. After five years, you shall meet the True One.\n\nOn the first dawn of the new year, inscribe the Precious Chapter in blue-green ink, face north, bow twice, and swallow it. Also inscribe on white silk and wear it upon your left elbow. After eight years, the Three Ones shall all come to meet you. Take a gold tablet, nine inches long, four inches wide, and three fen thick, engrave it, and seal the spirits of the Five Peaks Mountain within your palm.\n\nThe method of refining form from the Red General Zi: at night, close your eyes, draw in light through your mouth, and visualize your body burning, permeated inside and out like fire. Practice this for three years, and you shall be able to enter fire. This is the Zhou Lord’s formula.\n\nThe method of guarding the Three Origins and True One within the Five Pecks of Grain: refine your essence for three months, and you shall faintly perceive your form attaining longevity. Guard the True Lord of the Mysterious Elixir for fourteen years, and you shall ascend with the Great One to the Web of the Seven Origins. After sixteen years, you shall reach the Upper Clarity, granted eighteen jade boys and eighteen jade maidens.\n\nThe Mao Lord’s transmitted method of practice:\nThe method of visualizing the Mysterious Perfected in the Hall of Light: in a quiet chamber, at dawn, close your eyes, place your hands upon your knees, and visualize the sun by day and the moon by night—each as large as a ring, positioned nine feet before your mouth. The sun’s color is crimson, with nine rays of purple light; the moon’s color is yellow, with ten rays of white light, straight as strings, entering your mouth. Within the sun and moon dwells the Jade Maiden of the Great Mystery and Upper Mystery’s Vermilion Mist, named Chan Xuan, styled Mi Zhen. She wears a crown of purple hibiscus and a robe of red brocade, facing you directly. She declares her name and title, then exhales crimson qi into your mouth. As she exhales, you swallow ninety times, sensing the sun and moon gradually nearing your face. The Jade Maiden’s mouth joins with yours, her qi and fluids entering your mouth. Silently intone:\n“Purple Perfected of the Grand Empyrean,\nYin spirit of the Hall of Light,\nessence born of sun and moon,\nJade Maiden Chan Xuan,\nfirst sprung from divine birth,\nstyled Mi Zhen,\nher head wrapped in purple blossoms,\ncrowned with a hibiscus spirit-diadem,\nher body draped in brocade,\nrobed in vermilion flying skirts,\nemerging from the sun, entering the moon,\nher celestial radiance profound and fragrant.\nFrom her mouth exhales crimson qi,\nirrigating my Three Origins.\nMy face beholds the Heavenly Well,\nsoftening the *po* and restraining the *hun*,\nmysterious fluids flowing,\nthe embryo’s essence perfected and whole.\nThe five viscera bloom with splendor,\nreversing age to restore a child’s countenance.\nOverseeing the ten thousand spirits,\nappointed as an official of the Lord of Destiny, ascending as a flying immortal.”\n\nVisualize the Jade Maiden’s mouth pouring fluids into yours, rinse and swallow them ninety times. If unable to perform this at the appointed time, visualize the Two Radiant Ones returning to the Hall of Light, the sun to the left and the moon to the right, their brilliance merging with the pupils of your eyes.\n\nOn the first day of the lunar month and your own life-day, at midnight face east. Inscribe the Yang Talisman in cinnabar on blue-green paper and the Yin Talisman in yellow on blue-green paper. Then close your eyes and visualize the sun’s purple light and the moon’s yellow qi within the Hall of Light, illuminating your entire body. With your left hand, hold the Yang Talisman, hold your breath, and silently intone:\n“The Two Radiant Ones stream their essence,\ntheir light suffusing my form.\nTo the left, I gather the sun’s splendor,\nto the right, I pluck the moon’s blossoms.\nMerging the two qi,\nirrigating the Three Fields.\nFlying mists and mysterious radiance\nfortify my numinous root,\ngranting me long life,\ncoeval with heaven and earth.”\n\nConsume the talisman, then bow twice. With your right hand, hold the Yin Talisman, hold your breath, and silently intone:\n“Yellow qi of Yin’s splendor,\nYang’s essence luminous and fresh.\nThe five spirits refined and softened,\nthe Three Lefts firming the fluids.\nThe Two Radiant Ones gleam resplendent,\nflowing mists irrigating the Perfected.\nYin and Yang’s qi interpenetrate,\nrevolving yellow to infuse the cinnabar.\nMy entire body transmutes,\nascending to the imperial palace.”\n\nConsume the talisman, then bow twice. Practice the Way of the Mysterious Perfected for five years, and the Jade Maiden of the Great Mystery shall descend, subject to your command, communicating with spirits and attaining the Perfected. Your body shall glow with jade’s radiance, you shall command the ten thousand spirits, and ascend to the Jade Chamber.\n\nThe Wang Lord’s transmitted method of practice:\nAt the time of arising qi, sit or lie as you wish. Knock your teeth nine times and silently intone:\n“Azure Teeth of the East,\npurple clouds streaming with mist,\nthe Three Pristine Ones lingering,\nmysterious frost and jade gauze.\nConsume the morning’s radiance,\ndrink the dawn’s blossoms.”\nPress your tongue against the outer edge of your upper lip, gather fluids, and swallow thirty times. Then knock your teeth nine times and intone:\n\nTo the Vermilion Cinnabar of the South,\nwhere dawn’s radiance meets the Grand Tenuity,\nninefold crimson mists scatter luminous splendor—\nconsume the numinous morning,\ndrink from the Cinnabar Pool.\nPress your tongue against the outer edge of your lower lip, gather fluids, and swallow thirty times.\n\nThen knock your teeth nine times and intone:\nTo the Luminous Stone of the West,\nwhere flying auroras become golden liquor—\nconsume the Grand Clarity,\nessence of pristine clouds,\ndrink the Jade Liquid,\nas divine radiance awakens the spirit,\nthat I may ascend the void,\nrising to the highest purity.\nPress your tongue against the inner edge of your upper lip, gather fluids, and swallow thirty times.\n\nThen knock your teeth nine times and intone:\nTo the Mysterious Nourishment of the North,\nwhere blessed spirits quicken the embryo,\ngreen auroras unfold at dawn,\npurple canopies and azure banners—\nconsume the Cinnabar Flower,\ndrink the Nectar of Jade.\nPress your tongue along the inner edge of your lower lip, gather fluids, and swallow thirty times.\n\nThen knock your teeth nine times and intone:\nAt the origin of Wu and Ji,\nwhere yellow and pristine fivefold clouds arise,\nfour auroras and purple visions,\neight luminaries and nine dawns—\ndivide the radiant brilliance,\nseven luminaries and numinous lords,\nharmonize essence and irrigate qi,\nconsume the Central Origin,\nthe dragon-embryo of jade splendor,\ndrink from the Sweet Spring.\nRinse your mouth, swirling fluids between teeth and tongue, and swallow forty times.\n\nThis may be practiced after midnight.\n\nThe Wei Lady’s transmitted method of practice:\nAt dusk, burn incense and recite the *Huangting Neijing Jing* once. There is a separate scroll of scriptural instructions.\n\nFor the morning and evening audience in stillness, follow the regular practice without need for elaboration. On one’s fate-day, after the Jia-Wu day, count ninety days to reach the Jia-Zi day—on these two days, at dawn, enter stillness, burn incense, and face north to pay homage to the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity. Silently intone:\n“I, [Name], humble mortal of dust and clay, respectfully bow twice and pay homage before the Jade Tower and Purple Palace of the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity. May I attain long life as a divine immortal, fulfill all desires and wishes, and have my name inscribed on the Purple Register of the Life-Spirit, recorded by the Jade Sovereign. May I become a paragon among beings and ascend as an immortal to transcend the world.”\nBow twice.\n\nAfter the first day of the first month, count one hundred eighty-two days, then at midnight enter stillness, burn incense, and pay homage to the Most High Jade Dawn Lord of the Great Dao. Kneel and silently intone:\n“I, [Name], humble mortal, respectfully bow twice before the Jade Tower of the Most High and Lofty Sage. I beseech that the Life-Spirit be notified to inscribe my name for long life. May all my wishes and endeavors come to fruition, and may I, as a divine immortal or flying immortal, feast in the Nine Heavens.”\nBow twice.\n\nFor these three practices, first purify and fast for one day, wear separate garments, and enter stillness before proceeding. Whenever entering stillness, first cleanse the mouth and hold the breath. Upon entering the chamber, step forward with the right foot first, then bring the left foot forward to join it before proceeding. When exiting, do not look back; rinse the mouth and withdraw.\n\nReciting the *Huangting Jing* ten thousand times will reveal the five viscera, granting long life without death. Practicing these three audience rites will free one from illness and calamity, preventing death. After eighteen years, one ascends as an immortal.\n\nThe Precious Method for Cultivating the Spirit:\nRub your palms together until warm, then wipe your face in circular motions until it is warm and glowing, preventing wrinkles and blemishes.\n\nFrom the *Taisu Danjing Jing*.\n\nOn the fifth, fifteenth, twenty-fifth, and twenty-ninth days of the lunar month, at midnight, visualize the solar image entering through the mouth and residing within the heart, illuminating the heart’s inner radiance. Recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Great luminosity nurtures essence,\nWithin, the cinnabar heart is refined.\nRadiance and splendor merge in reflection,\nDivine perfected ones come to seek.\"*\n\nSwallow the saliva nine times. This may also be practiced daily, not solely on these four days. It sharpens perception and insight, and the body emanates a golden luster.\n\nFrom the *Tai Shang Xiao Mo Jing*.\n\nWhen rising from bed or sitting upright, first gather both hands, then cross them to cover the nape. Tilt the head back and resist with the hands three or four times. Next, bend and move the body, stretch the limbs to their utmost, arch backward, and twist to the sides, loosening all joints three times.\n\nFrom the *Tai Shang Dong Jing Jing*.\n\nRegularly press the small cavities behind the eyebrows thirty-nine times with the hands. Then, with the palms and fingers, massage the area beneath the eyes and above the cheekbones. Rotate the ears thirty times with the hands. Finally, starting from the midpoint between the eyebrows, sweep the hands upward across the forehead into the hairline thirty-nine times. Internally visualize the twin luminaries of the sun and moon held by the infant spirit, with joy in the Upper Prime. Swallow the saliva at the corners of the mouth. This unblocks the flow of blood and qi, prevents wrinkles, and with prolonged practice, grants clear perception of the hundred spirits.\n\nFrom Pei Jun’s *Baoshen Jing*.\n\nHere ends the lower scroll of the *Shangqing Wozhong Jue*.",

      "translated_text": "The Rite of Pacing the Net to Shed Death’s Name and Ascend the Jade Register follows the same form, with only minor variations. On the six *jiǎ*-days, after pacing forth, turn left and face downward toward the terrace. Hold the breath, follow the Net’s threads with Yu’s step, and tread upon the stars upward to the Metal Star. First place the left foot forward and the right foot drawn back, ascending one star together. Upon reaching Metal, reverse the feet so the right leads, then tread the stars back. After nine full cycles, halt upon the Metal Star, knock the teeth three times, and release the breath. Pray thus:\n\nUpper Terrace of Void Essence,\nMiddle Terrace of Sixfold Purity,\nLower Terrace of Curved Life—\nif seeking gold and jade, invoke the Upper Terrace;\nif seeking rank and emolument, invoke the Middle Terrace;\nif seeking fields and land, invoke the Lower Terrace.\nLet the three matters follow the petitioner’s desire.\n\nThen descend along the Net’s threads in a free pace, returning to ascend the Five Stars.\n\nNext, pace the Five Stars.\nFirst face the Net’s mouth, close the eyes, hold the breath, knock the teeth five times, and swallow saliva five times. Visualize the essence of each of the Five Stars residing within the five viscera. The stars’ forms and their rays of light, along with the inner radiance of the viscera, shine through brightly. Whisper the prayer:\n\nThe Five Stars array their light,\nilluminating the five directions.\nThe Water Star averts calamity,\nthe Wood Star brings prosperity,\nthe Fiery Star dissolves misfortune,\nthe White Star repels weapons,\nthe Earth Star secures the four quarters—\nmay I gain profit and uprightness.\nMy name is inscribed on the Jade Tablet,\nrecorded in the Emperor’s chamber.\nRiding the whirlwind and fanning the light,\nI soar through the Great Void,\nentering and exiting the Dark Origin,\nroaming and feasting in the ten directions.\nFive clouds float as my canopy,\nsummoning spirits and seizing the wind,\ncommanding the myriad numina,\nto guard and serve the Transcendent Lords above.\n\nThen silently invoke the names of the Five Star Sovereigns and their Consorts, following the method of the Eightfold Invocation. Release the breath, hold it again, and step over the Net to tread upon the stars. Place the left foot upon Metal, advance the right foot to join it, and face the corresponding direction. With the left hand touching the heart, declare, “I ascend as a flying transcendent.” Next, ascend Earth, turning the feet toward Fire. Ascend Fire, then Wood, then Water, then reverse back to Wood. In all reverse movements, the right foot leads first. Thus proceed back and forth three times. Then, according to the diagram, ascend Metal, then Fire, then Earth, turning the feet toward Wood. Ascend Wood, then Water, then reverse back to Wood. Thus proceed back and forth fifteen times in total. Descend, and if fearing distraction, count on the fingers. Turn left, face the Net’s mouth, and silently pray. Each time you reach a star, join the feet, place the left hand upon the heart, invoke the name of the star’s Sovereign and his Consort, and silently declare, “I ascend as a flying transcendent.” When all is complete, kneel, roll up the diagram, and depart. Burn incense and bow twice.\n\nIf encountering malevolent ghosts or wicked persons, visualize the Dipper’s stars covering your head, point the Dipper’s handle forward, hold the breath, and silently pray:\n\nI am the Heavenly Eye,\npursuing Heaven’s course.\nMy essence is like thunder and lightning,\nilluminating the eight realms,\npenetrating all within and without,\nsubduing all without exception.\nPacing the flying step,\nin one year I avert misfortune,\nin two years I avert weapons,\nin three years I avert death,\nin four years I become an Earth Transcendent.\nPracticing this for fourteen years,\nI become a Perfected One of the Highest Clarity.\n\nThe Oral Instructions for Recording Practices and Affairs\n\nOn the night of the month’s last day at midnight, face east and write the Solar Qi Talisman in cinnabar on blue paper, and the Lunar Essence Talisman in yellow on blue paper. First hold the Solar Talisman in the left hand, hold the breath, and silently pray:\n\nThe Vermilion Script of the Great Culmen,\nnamed “Opening Brightness,”\nsummons the sun’s upper soul\nto transform my form.\nAt dawn’s strict adornment,\ndeparting from the round courtyard,\nflying blossom of the water mother,\ngolden essence of the solar root—\npurple radiance streaming light,\ncalled the Five Numinous Ones.\n\nThen ingest it. Next, hold the Lunar Talisman in the right hand, hold the breath, and silently pray:\n\nThe Yellow Script of the Purple Culmen,\nnamed “Great Mystery,”\nsummons the moon’s radiant water\nto nourish the po and harmonize the hun.\nAt the square’s strict observance,\ndeparting from the Dark Pass,\nhiding the sky and concealing the moon,\nthe Five Numinous Ladies—\nflying light of nine paths,\nilluminating the Muddy Pellet.\n\nThen ingest it.\n\nThe Method of Ingesting Solar Qi\nAt dawn, await the sun’s first rising. Face the sun, sit or stand as you wish, knock the teeth nine times, and silently invoke:\n\nSolar soul, Pearl Radiance,\nIlluminating Sheath, Green Reflection,\nReturning Rosy Clouds, Crimson Youth,\nDark Flame, Whirlwind Image.\n\nStill the eyes, clench the fists, and visualize the sun’s five-colored streaming radiance all coming to embrace the body, descending to the two feet and ascending to the crown of the head. Then see within the radiance a purple qi like an eye’s pupil, layered in dozens of folds, coming with the five colors into the mouth. Swallow it in forty-five breaths, then swallow saliva nine times, knock the teeth nine times, and whisper the prayer:\n\nCrimson furnace of cinnabar qi,\nround heaven nurturing essence,\nhardness receiving softness,\nflaming water’s yin flower—\nsolar origin’s radiant scene,\ncalled Great Brightness.\nNine yangs transform together,\ntwo smokes arise as one.\nCongealing the hun and harmonizing the po,\nessence of the five qi,\nwithin arise the Five Emperors.\nRiding the light and guiding the form,\nplucking the flying from the void,\ngrasping the root to gain fullness—\ncrown draped in dragon canopy,\nrobed in vermilion and girded in blue,\nreins of the crow flowing dark,\nrosy clouds illuminating Highest Clarity.\nBestowed the Jade Tablet’s script,\nname carved in the Golden Chamber.\nIngesting the dawn’s blossom,\nuniting with the Perfected in numinosity,\nflying transcendent of the Great Culmen,\nascending to the Purple Court.\n\nBow twice.\n\nThe Method of Ingesting Lunar Essence\nAwait the moon’s first rising. Face the moon, sit or stand as you wish, knock the teeth ten times, and silently invoke:\n\nLunar po, Warm Mist,\nFragrant Bloom, Veiled Loneliness,\nGraceful Void, Orchid’s Luxuriance,\nFlowering Knot, Pure Gold’s Luminous Jade,\nGenuine Countenance, Terrace’s Standard.\n\nStill the eyes, clench the fists, and visualize the moon’s five-colored streaming essence all coming to embrace the body, descending to the two feet and ascending to the crown of the head. Then see within the radiance a yellow qi like an eye’s pupil, layered in dozens of folds, coming with the five colors into the mouth. Swallow it in fifty breaths, then swallow saliva ten times, knock the teeth ten times, and whisper the prayer:\n\nYellow-green, dark radiance,\nprimal yin’s upper qi,\nscattering the luxuriant cold whirlwind,\ngathering the numinous and restraining the stomach—\nnuminous waves, orchid’s sharpness,\nupright and washed, halting the vessel.\nLunar essence, night’s scene,\nsupreme treasure of the Dark Palace.\nFive Sovereigns and Ladies,\neach guarding their maternal position.\nThe Red Child flies in,\nthe Infant arrives in accomplishment.\nRevolving yin’s triple union,\nlight and mystery pervading the ten thousand directions.\nHarmonizing the hun and restraining the po,\nthe five wombs flowing freely.\nRiding the rosy clouds and flying essence,\nsoaring in emptiness to the east—\ncrown knotted in numinous clouds,\nrosy blossoms summoning the wind.\nLeft girded with the Dragon Talisman,\nright cinched with the Tiger Seal,\nvermilion cloak of phoenix plumes,\njade pendants and golden earrings.\nThe soaring tree knotted in the heights,\ncalled the Wood King—\nspirit’s luxuriance controlling the root,\nnow waning, now full.\nBright essence inwardly radiant,\ndark water spouting the beam.\nBestowed the Jade Tablet’s script,\nname carved in the Numinous Chamber.\nIngesting the moon’s blossom,\nuniting with the Perfected in harmony,\nflying transcendent of the Purple Culmen,\nascending to pay court to the Great Sovereign.",

      "translated_text": "After eighteen years of ordered practice and recorded affairs, one rides the Three Radiant Essences and soars through the Great Void.\n\n*Here ends the first scroll of* The Hand-Clasp Oral Instructions of the Highest Clarity. *(Note: The original text has minor lacunae. The base text did not originally contain the words “Lacuna Noted”; the collator added them based on the content.)*\n\n*The Hand-Clasp Oral Instructions of the Highest Clarity, Second Scroll*\n\n**Method for Guarding the Mysterious Elixir**\nOn the first, third, seventh, eleventh, and fifteenth nights of the month at midnight, the visualization follows the same method as that for the Three Ones. On ordinary days and evenings, proceed according to the present instructions.\n\nAt dusk, in tranquil repose, dispel all thoughts. First visualize the Northern Culmen star, from which a purple qi emerges like a bowstring, descending to enter the Palace of the Mysterious Elixir. Soon the palace fills and overflows, encircling the body and merging completely with the purple qi. Then visualize the sun suddenly flying in to enter the palace, gleaming brilliantly within the purple qi. Next visualize the Highest Clarity’s Central Yellow Supreme One Perfected Lord emerging from the Northern Culmen’s purple qi to sit within the sun. His attire, colors, name, and implements are all as before. Call his title and name three times. Suddenly visualize yourself stepping before the Supreme One, bowing twice with head touching the ground, and seeking the Dao to attain immortality. Then swallow the purple qi thirty times and the saliva thirty times.\n\nNext visualize the Dipper’s *Kui* asterism emitting a red qi like a bowstring, which enters the Palace of the Mysterious Elixir. Thereupon, the Perfected Lord and you together mount the sun and travel within the red qi’s path, ascending to rest within the *Kui*. Focus the visualization clearly, then lie down to sleep, and true resonance will occur.\n\nAt times other than evening, simply visualize the Supreme One in the Palace of the Mysterious Elixir, with purple qi emerging to encircle the body, and swallow it. If you hear ringing in the ears, cover them with crossed hands and intone:\n\n*The Red Child dwells in the palace, the Nine Perfected in the chamber. Hearken to the divine command, discern inauspicious omens. The Supreme One’s flowing fire overawes the ten thousand evils.*\n\nPoint to the ear’s gate seven times. If the face feels warm, it is auspicious. If the nape grows cold in patches, evil qi has entered. Immediately lie down, close the eyes, and visualize the Supreme One of the Mysterious Elixir wielding a fiery bell to cast it out, expelling the evil qi beyond the ears. The firelight will follow, blazing brightly to illuminate the entire body. After a long while, equilibrium will return.\n\nFor all inauspicious sights and sounds, concentrate on visualizing the Perfected Lord to seek deliverance and protection, and the ten thousand evils will not intrude.\n\n**Method of Great Stillness**\nThose who guard the One, on *jia-wu*, *jia-chen*, and *jia-yin* days at midnight, sweep and purify the courtyard of their tranquil chamber. Alternatively, construct an altar one *zhang* square, screen its four sides, lay out mats, burn incense, face north, bow twice, sit upright with hands clasped, close the eyes, and visualize the Three Palaces and Three Ones as prescribed.\n\nNext visualize the Three Radiant Cloud Qi, each within its palace, with the Three Persons seated within the qi. The Three Radiant Ones wear purple, cyan, and crimson robes, layered in deep obscurity. Then gaze upward at the Northern Dipper and visualize purple qi emerging from the *Kui* like a straight bowstring, entering the mouth and dispersing into the Three Palaces. Thereupon, the Three Ones, the Three Ministers, and you suddenly emerge, together mounting the purple qi to ascend into the Dipper’s *Kui*. Then, riding the Three Radiant Essences, traverse into the Northern Culmen, where you behold the Purple Chambers, Jade Stairs, and celestial officials in ordered ranks. The Supreme One Perfected Lord, crowned with a purple dawn cap and clad in dragon-embroidered phoenix robes, sits facing south. You and the six others ascend the stairs, face north, bow, and entreat the Way of flying transcendence and long life. After a long while, you forget yourself as if dwelling in heaven for ages, then quietly rise and return to your chamber. On rainy days, perform the visualization while lying in bed.\n\nOn *shang-jian* days at dawn, face due east, sit upright, hold the breath, close the eyes, and inwardly visualize the Three Palaces, Three Ones, and Three Ministers as prescribed. Then visualize them suddenly emerging to sit before you. Rise in your heart and bow twice to each, making them appear vividly. Then silently intone:\n\n*Celestial Honored Three Emperors, guard my Gate of Destiny. Roam the Void, where the Six Qi mystically divide. Nourish my Five Spirits, rectify my Three *Hun*. Let my Five Viscera spontaneously flourish, that I may attain long life and fly as an immortal.*\n\nNext visualize them suddenly returning from the Void to the Three Palaces, where they remain as prescribed. Then swallow saliva thirty times. With prolonged practice, you will dream of gold, jade, white crows, and other objects—signs of gradual attainment of the One.\n\nOn *shang-chu* days at midnight, rise quietly, face north, and gaze upward at the Dipper’s inner image, the forms of the Assistant and Minister stars. Suddenly visualize the Three Ones and Three Ministers emerging from the Assistant Star to descend into the Three Palaces. Return to your chamber, hold the breath, close the eyes, and inwardly visualize with focused concentration as prescribed. After a long while, softly intone:\n\n*Supreme Celestial Assistant, realm where the Three Emperors roam, the Three Ministers follow in attendance, uniting with the Perfected. Descend into my body, sit in tranquil stillness. Exhale essence to bathe my form, harmonizing *hun* and *po*. Let me fly as an immortal, riding a cloud chariot in the floating heavens.*\n\nSwallow saliva twenty-seven times.\n\nOn *kai* days at midnight, rise and sit facing east. Remove your headcloth—you may also loosen your hair, comb it, and tie it again. Close the eyes, inwardly visualize, and softly call:\n\n*Three Perfected of the Upper Prime, Infant within the Perfected. Dishevel the hair, open the mist, ascend to connect with the Celestial Terrace. Solidify the Mud-Pill, congeal it to be coeval with heaven. Let me fly as an immortal, traversing the Terrace of Intermingling.*\n\nSwallow saliva nineteen times, then don your headcloth and lie down. Further visualize the Three Ones in their palaces exhaling qi thirty times, and you also exhale qi thirty times. You should feel a warm, gentle heat suffusing your body—this is the sign of harmonized *po* and congealed *hun*.\n\nWhen the moon first appears, face it and bow twice. Visualize the moon’s white light with ten rays descending to embrace your body, penetrating and illuminating the Three Palaces. Silently intone:\n\n*Mysterious Essence of the Great Yin, Radiant Moon Lady, newly born flowing light, illuminate my Three Palaces. Let the divine immortals ascend and fly, roaming the eight directions. Wherever I turn, wherever I wish, may all be enveloped in blessing.*\n\nYou may also bow twice.\n\nBefore eating, first compose the mind. Close the eyes and visualize the Three Ones in their palaces, joining from afar to partake in the offering. Only then begin to eat.",

Whisper the following incantation:\n\n*\"Great Cavern, True Mystery—\nZhang refines the Three Hun.\nThe First Hun swiftly guards the Po,\nthe Second Hun swiftly guards the Mud-Pill Palace,\nthe Third Hun obeys the heart’s command.\nHasten to summon the Supreme Lords of the Three Origins.\nI have encountered an inauspicious dream:\nthe Seven Po, wandering corpse-spirits, have come to cling to the source of evil.\nSwiftly call upon Peach-Kang to shield my life,\ndissolve the malign fluids,\ntransform misfortune into fortune,\nand preserve the primal bond of life and death.\"*\n\nWhen finished, lie down again, and a favorable response will surely come.\n\nIt is said that those who frequently encounter ominous dreams do so for three reasons: first, the Po’s demonic influence; second, the heart’s trial; third, the corpse-thief’s plunder. Thus, by dispelling and dissolving these, one seals the Three Passes below, turning misfortune into fortune.\n\n**Auspicious Dreams**\nUpon awakening from an auspicious dream, rub the eyes thirty-four times, gnash the teeth thirty-four times, and whisper the following incantation:\n\n*\"Supreme High Essence,\nThree Emperors of Cinnabar Spirit,\nthe Crimson Palace radiant and clear—\nauspicious omens declare their message.\nThe Three Origins soften the Po,\nthe Heavenly Sovereign bestows the scripture.\nAll I pursue harmonizes,\nI ascend as an immortal to the Upper Clarity,\never in the company of Jade Perfected,\ntogether we gather in the Purple Court.\"*\n\nThese incantations for auspicious and ominous dreams derive from the affairs of the Great Cinnabar Cavern Chamber. If one has not received this scripture, it is improper to perform these rites or make petitions while reciting them.\n\nWhen troubled by an ominous dream, at dawn one should invoke the Supreme, rectify the Hun and Po, and dispel inauspiciousness. Face the direction of the sunrise, bow in reverence, and petition for absolution. Place a musk sachet at the neck to repel the qi of water infusions and banish ominous dreams.\n\nIf one frequently dreams of tombs or the deceased, upon awakening, face upward and gnash the teeth three times, then whisper this incantation:\n\n*\"Supreme Origin, Upper Mystery,\nNine Capitals of the Purple Heaven—\ngovern the Hun, protect my life,\nLofty Plain Perfected.\nI have received the supreme method,\ntaught by the Great Mystery.\nLong life and enduring vision,\nspirit soars, body becomes immortal.\nTombs forever at peace,\nghostly disputes and treachery sealed.\nHun and Po harmonious and joyful,\nmalign qi vanishes like smoke.\nWandering demons, do not covet;\nspecters, dare not assail my spirit.\nThe Northern Emperor commands,\nseize the qi and cast it into the abyss.\nReceive the register of the Supreme August,\nreport to the Jade Dawn.\"*\n\nRecite this twice, and with each recitation, gnash the teeth three times. This is the Northern Emperor’s secret incantation. For all ominous and inauspicious dreams, one may apply this method. Those with sincere intent may also practice it.\n\nUpon awakening at night, swiftly close the eyes, gnash the teeth nine times, and swallow saliva nine times. Then, with the hands, press along the sides of the nose, moving up and down dozens of times, and whisper:\n\n*\"Supreme Four Luminaries,\nNine Gates emit essence.\nEars and eyes profoundly clear,\ncommuning with the true, reaching the numinous.\nPavilion of Heaven’s Center,\nflowing qi harmonized and balanced.\nMaiden Jiao with cloud-like bearing,\neyes of the youth bright and keen.\nFlourishing wisdom, resplendent clarity,\nall senses refined and pure.\nPreserve harmony in the Upper Origin,\nwander through the Nine Citadels.\nThe Five Viscera plant their roots,\nears and eyes naturally thrive.\nThe Heavenly Terrace, lofty and plain,\npillars and beams stand firm.\nThe Seven Po refined and tempered,\nthe Three Hun at peace.\nThe Red Child carries the radiance,\never at my side.\nShould any dare obscure my ears and eyes,\nthe Supreme shall crush them with flowing bells.\nAll myriad misfortunes vanish,\nevery wish shall be fulfilled.\nSun and Moon guard the gates,\nthe heart stores the Five Stars.\nAs the True Sovereign has invoked,\nlet all echoes heed with reverence.\"*\n\nWhen finished, swallow saliva nine more times, and rub the face until it is slightly warm. Make this a regular practice. Upon every awakening, perform this pressing and incantation without fail.\n\nIt is said that this is the Way the Perfected conduct themselves in daily life. Practicing it constantly, whether sitting or lying down, sharpens the ears and eyes, restores a youthful complexion, governs the Hun, refines the Po, and repels a thousand demons.\n\nUpon awakening at night, visualize the solar image within, swiftly grasp it in the palm, and cause the sun’s red rays to flow backward from the arm to the elbow and armpit. After a long while, the solar rays suddenly transform into fire, burning the arm until it is thoroughly permeated inside and out. Then, inaudibly recite:\n\n*\"Four Luminaries of the Upper Origin,\nqi of the Sun and Moon divide.\nFlowing light radiant and bright,\nirrigating the fluids, congealing the Hun.\nDivine fire scatters the radiance,\nscouring filth, refining smoke.\nThoroughly penetrating the wind and qi,\nall evil burns away.\nMay I attain long life,\nmy four limbs whole and sound.\nMalignant ghosts that inflict harm,\nconsign them to the Northern Asterism.\"*\n\nAfterward, engage in visualization for a long while, then relax the body and forget the self.\n\nIt is said that those afflicted with wind in the hands should practice this. For wind qi in the head, face, or other areas, apply this method to the respective location and burn with visualization while reciting the incantation.\n\nAt the time of living qi, swallow saliva thirty-four times, and press the afflicted area of the body. Face the direction of the ruler and recite:\n\n*\"Left Mystery, Right Mystery,\nThree Spirits unite as one.\nLeft Yellow, Right Yellow,\nSix Floras align.\nWind qi and ghostly ailments,\nsubdue and conceal in the four directions.\nJade fluid flows with moisture,\nup and down freely circulating.\nInternally dispatch water and fire,\nexternally repel inauspiciousness.\nLong life and flying immortality,\nthe body ever strong and at ease.\"*\n\nWhen finished, swallow saliva twenty-seven more times. Practicing this regularly will ensure freedom from illness.",

      "translated_text": "For acute pain, press the afflicted area thirty-one times in rapid succession. When the pain flares, press swiftly while reciting the incantation, repeating this several times before ceasing. The painful spot need not be precisely located.\n\nFor numbness or immobility in the arms, first gently massage the afflicted limb with one hand for a long while. Then, with eyes closed, inwardly visualize, click the teeth, and swallow saliva three times. Compose the mind and softly recite:\n\n*\"Supreme Four Mysteries,\nFive Floras and Six Courts,\nThree Hun and Seven Po,\nCelestial Pass and Earthly Essence,\nDivine Palaces and Protective Qi,\nRadiance of the Heavenly Terrace,\nHundred Spirits of the Four Limbs,\nMyriad Spirits of the Nine Joints,\nReceive the Jade Dawn Register,\nInscribed in the Five Cities,\nJade Maidens attend my body,\nJade Lads guard my life,\nForever aligned with the Two Luminaries,\nAscending as an Immortal to the Upper Clarity,\nAgeless as the sun and moon,\nTranscending to ascend as a Perfected One,\nAttaining Great Peace.\nFlowing winds and congealed ailments,\nPossessing ghosts and flying demons,\nSpecters and tomb qi,\nYin qi assailing me,\nEncircling my limbs,\nThreatening my flourishing and decline—\nCelestial Soldiers of the Supreme,\nDragon and Tiger manifest their might,\nSlaying ghosts and inauspiciousness,\nCrushing wind and evil.\nExamine and suppress hidden grievances,\nConcealed poisons and falsehoods,\nRestore me to my normal state,\nRadiant as the sun and moon.\nIf examined and violated,\nThe Northern Asterism shall seize and destroy,\nAs though defying the luminous might.\"*\n\nThis is the Northern Emperor’s Curved Incantation. For all afflictions of a similar nature, employ this method. If unable to press the area oneself, have another do so while you inwardly visualize, swallow saliva, click the teeth, and recite. Practicing this a hundred times will dissolve the ailment.\n\nBefore sleeping at night, first close the eyes tightly and face east. With the thumbs behind the palms, press and wipe the eyes toward the ears, crossing the hands to meet at the nape thirty-nine times. Visualize three colored qi—purple, azure, and crimson—emerging from each eye. Then recite in silence:\n\n*\"Eye Lads of the Three Clouds,\nTrue Lords of the Two Eyes,\nBrilliant and luminous, infusing essence,\nOpening and clarifying the pure spirit,\nCloudy Splendor of the Great Mystery,\nSpiritual maidens fluttering,\nSafeguarding the twin gates,\nUnsealing the nine portals,\nHundred joints resonating,\nMorning saliva ascending to the Mud-Pill Palace,\nBody ascending to the Jade Palace,\nEnnobled as an Upper Perfected One.\"*\n\nWhen finished, swallow saliva fifty times, then open the eyes. This may be practiced regularly upon sitting or rising, not only at night, though it is best performed during the time of living qi. Practicing this for a year will clarify hearing and vision. With prolonged practice, one may perceive a thousand miles and behold the radiance of spirits. Thus, it need not be confined to night; from midnight until noon, whenever there is leisure, perform it—always facing east.\n\nAt midday, swallow saliva twenty-seven times and press the Celestial Perfection point, located at the inner corners of the eyebrows. For the Mountain Source, press the philtrum just below the nose. For the Flowery Court, press the hollows beneath the eyebrows. Press each thirty-nine times while reciting:\n\n*\"Open the Celestial Court,\nGrant me long life,\nPerceive ten thousand miles,\nHun and Po return as infants,\nExtinguish ghosts and repel demons,\nSummon a thousand spirits,\nAscend to the Supreme,\nMerge with the sun,\nAttain the rank of Perfected One,\nInscribed in the Mysterious Register.\"*\n\nThis enables spiritual perception and repels all evil. The points may be pressed sequentially or simultaneously while reciting. Regularly press the small cavities behind the eyebrows thirty-nine times. Rub the area beneath the eyes and above the cheekbones with the palms and fingers. Rotate the ears thirty times, then reverse the motion, sweeping the forehead thirty-nine times from the midpoint of the brows upward into the hairline. Swallow saliva freely, without count. With both hands, stroke the head in all directions, smoothing the hair and tying it securely—do this frequently. When finished, press the corners of the eyes eighteen times until light is clearly perceived. Practice diligently, without fixed times or limits. After a year, one may write in the dark; with prolonged practice, one may perceive a hundred spirits. This method derives from the *Supreme Treasure Spirit Scripture*, and even Perfected Ones do not abandon it. Practice it whenever leisure permits, without restriction.\n\nBefore sleeping and upon rising, rub the hands until warm, then wipe the neck, ears, and their surroundings until gently heated. Stroke the head in the direction of the hair, then rub the palms to treat the face and eyes. First, rub the palms vigorously until hot, then wipe the face. Stroke the hair toward the nape, alternating hands. When finished, swallow saliva thirty times.\n\nUpon rising, sit upright and compose the breath. First clasp the hands, then raise them to cover the nape. Tilt the head back, straining the neck against the hands three or four times. Flex and extend the body, stretching the limbs to their utmost, arching backward and twisting to the sides, mobilizing all joints—repeat each movement three times. This is the Essence-Light Massage Method, harmonizing essence and blood, preventing the intrusion of wind qi. With prolonged practice, one will neither die nor fall ill.\n\nRegularly press the inner corners of the eyes near the nose while holding the breath; cease when qi flows smoothly, then exhale and begin anew. With persistent practice, the eyes will attain penetrating vision. Frequently press and rub the ears on both sides, without count. Do the same for the nose. Often cover the mouth and nose with the hands, close the eyes, and gently breathe. Over time, saliva will form in the palms; use it to rub the face and eyes, imparting fragrance to the body.\n\nWhen sitting, often close the eyes and inwardly visualize the five viscera and intestines. With prolonged practice, they will become distinctly clear. When lying down, close the eyes, relax the body, and breathe softly. Inwardly gaze and listen to the four directions, extending perception to a thousand miles. With focused intent, one may perceive events a hundred miles away and hear the sounds of metal, stone, silk, and bamboo. Though initially indistinct, with time and sincerity, one will naturally attain mastery. Begin by focusing on one direction, progressing from near to far—hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of miles—then shift to another direction, encompassing all without obstruction.",

      "translated_text": "When combing the hair, face the direction of the kingly earth. At the beginning of combing, softly recite the incantation: *\"Mud Pill’s mysterious blossom, preserve essence and ensure its longevity. On the right lies the hidden moon, on the left the root of the sun. The six harmonies refine the essence, and the ten thousand spirits receive grace.\"* Upon completion, swallow saliva three times.\n\nWhen bathing, constantly visualize the Six Dings, and whatever one desires will come to pass. Each of the Six Dings corresponds to its respective cyclical period and should face its designated direction. One should bathe frequently—there is no harm in bathing often, only in one’s inability to do so. It washes away the stench of the corpse, allowing true qi to enter. On every *jiazi* day, one should bathe; if not, then at the beginning of each month, to enable spiritual communion.\n\nIf one treads upon filth or any unclean place, one should wash and bathe to purify the body and dispel impurities. The method involves ten liang of bamboo leaves and four liang of peeled white peach bark, boiled in one *hu* and two *dou* of clear water until it reaches a single boil. Adjust the temperature and bathe the body, and all impurities will vanish. While bathing is most effective, this water should not be used for washing the hair. Instead, use the pure essence of refined water for bathing. If one must wash the hair, follow the usual method separately.\n\nIt is also said that among worldly talismanic waters, none compare to this method when used for rinsing the mouth or holding in the mouth. There are also other talismanic water methods. Orthodox Unity Daoists have their own regular practices, while the Eight Officials and Six Jias possess a separate talismanic water superior for dispelling impurities. Here, it is appended for concurrent use.\n\nWrite in cinnabar on white paper, then place it in clear water while facing the kingly direction. Hold the water vessel in the left hand and a sword in the right. Strike the teeth three times, then spray the water while reciting: *\"Ghosts of the hundred impurities, swiftly depart ten thousand miles. If you do not leave, you will be slain. O White Youth of the West.\"* Strike the vessel’s edge with the sword three times, then recite and strike the teeth again, repeating this three times in total. Use the water to rinse the mouth, whether for oneself, another, or an unclean place, and the impurities will dissolve—no bathing is required.\n\nWhen ingesting immortal medicines, always face one’s life direction upon completion, and avoid speaking of death, mourning, or inauspicious matters to prevent harming the fetal spirit, rendering the medicine ineffective. Before eating, do not discuss death, nor leave food exposed, lest various malevolent qi gather. When eating, face one’s life direction or the kingly qi.\n\nDaoist methods and plain garments should not be lent to others, nor should carriages, clothing, beds, or bedding be shared. The chambers where one sits or sleeps should be kept clean and uncluttered to receive pure qi; if unclean, one will absorb stale qi. Stale qi disrupts the chambers, causing endeavors to fail and undertakings to falter. The body should also be frequently washed and bathed to remain pure; otherwise, immortality cannot be attained. Infrequent bathing is the nature of the *po*; to distance the *po* and return to the true, one refines its turbid filth, and the *po* will gradually vanish. Bathe often, constantly visualize the Six Dings, and whatever one desires will come to pass.\n\nBeware of discussing Daoist studies, for such talk invites ghostly interference. If one is unafraid, illness will swiftly follow, as the body has not yet attained authenticity. When transcribing scriptures, always burn incense on both sides. When deeply contemplating, burn incense nearby.\n\nImpatience and violence are thieves and illnesses of the body. In all matters, one should be gentle, unhurried, and thoroughly pure. Those who wish to study the Dao should never let others know what they have seen or heard; in all things, act with utmost discretion.\n\n**Method of Storing the Sun in the Heart**\nOn the fifth, fifteenth, and twenty-ninth days of the lunar month, at midnight, visualize the sun entering the mouth and residing in the heart, illuminating the heart’s interior. Merge with the sun’s light for a long while until the heart feels warm, then recite: *\"Great brightness nurtures essence, internally refining the cinnabar heart. Radiance converges and reflects, and divine perfected beings come seeking.\"* Swallow saliva nine times.\n\nIt is also said that this practice should be performed frequently, not strictly on these days, and may be done every night. This is the internal method of the Crimson Lord of the Great Void.\n\n**Method of Ingesting the Sun and Moon’s Forms**\nMen ingest the sun’s form, women the moon’s form, once daily without fail. It is said to write the characters for \"sun\" and \"moon\" and ingest them, though the time is not specified. Now, one may write the character for \"sun\" in cinnabar on blue paper, nine *fen* square, cut into thousands of pieces. Each dawn, face east, hold them in the left hand, visualize the sun’s form with its proper radiance, then swallow them, allowing them to reside in the heart. Strike the teeth and swallow saliva nine times each.\n\nWomen should write the moon’s form in yellow on yellow paper and ingest it with the right hand. This is the method of the Perfected One of Eastern Florescence.\n\n**Method of Ingesting the Sun’s Rays**\nThe true forms of the sun and moon are to be ingested separately, as recorded in the *Hidden Instructions*. Sit upright, close the eyes, and directly visualize the sun’s form within the heart, the size of a coin, crimson in color, with nine rays of purple light. It rises from the heart, passes through the throat, and reaches the teeth, then returns to the stomach. After a long while, clearly visualize the heart and stomach, then exhale, rinse the mouth with saliva, and swallow it thirty-nine times.\n\nPerform this three times a day: at dawn facing east, at noon facing south, and at dusk facing west.\n\n**Method of Ingesting the Moon’s Rays**\nAt night, visualize the moon in the Mud Pill Palace, yellow in color, with ten rays of white light. It also reaches the teeth but does not emerge, returning instead to the stomach. This should also be performed three times a night, during the *hai*, *zi*, and *chou* hours. The moon, one *cun* in diameter, resides in the Cinnabar Field Palace, its ten white rays flowing into the mouth, then swallowed into the throat and stomach, allowing the white light to illuminate everything. Exhale, swallow saliva thirty-nine times, and visualize while lying down.\n\nThis is the method of the Lord of Western City, transmitted from the Central Teachings of Eastern Florescence, enabling the sun and moon to constantly illuminate the body, causing ghostly and primal beings to conceal their forms. Unceasing practice ensures protection and the vision of Great Peace.\n\n**Method of Ingesting the Three Qi**\nDaily, face the sun, close the eyes, and visualize green qi, white qi, and red qi, each like a thread, descending from the sun into the mouth. Inhale them ninety times until satiated, then stop.",

      "translated_text": "With each inhalation, swallow once, allowing the three qi to enter the viscera. They branch and flow through, permeating everything; once the count is complete, the qi subsides.\n\nThis method was first received by Fan Jian of Dongyang and You Zhong from the High Prime Lord’s *Inner Radiance of Grand Simplicity*. Its effects are rare yet easily verified.\n\n**Method of Ingesting Mist**\nAt dawn, within a quiet chamber, sit or lie as you wish. First close the eyes and inwardly visualize, faintly perceiving the five viscera. Then, facing the light, exhale through the mouth, emitting the five-colored qi twenty-four times, so that the eyes behold the five-colored qi intertwining and swirling before the face in a dense cloud. Next, inhale this five-colored qi through the mouth fifty times, then swallow saliva sixty times. Softly recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Great mist unfurls its radiance,\nSpirit-mist traverses the four directions,\nCoiling qi bends and twists,\nFive colors illuminate the cavern-heaven.\nDivine smoke converges and ascends,\nMetal and stone blossom with true essence.\nPurple emptiness gathers in lush abundance,\nRefining form to preserve its wholeness.\nEmerging from light, concealed in mystery,\nThe five numina transform and divide.\nConjoined brightness fans the void,\nRiding the six clouds in harmony,\nThey gather and shield my body,\nAscending to the Nine Heavens.\"*\n\nWhen finished, knock the teeth together seven times and swallow saliva seven times, then open the eyes.\n\nThis method was transmitted by the Mistress of the Enshrouded Terrace, the female perfected Zhang Weizi, as part of the Eastern Florescence teachings. Though it speaks of exhaling the viscera’s qi and is called \"ingesting mist,\" the twenty-four exhalations are the viscera’s qi, which then harmonize with the misty qi of Heaven and Earth to re-enter the body—hence the sudden intake of fifty breaths.\n\n**Method of Guarding the Mysterious and White**\nAt dawn, sit or lie as you wish. Visualize qi within the Mud-Pill Palace, white qi within the heart, and yellow qi within the navel. All three qi emerge like small beans, gradually growing larger, intertwining and merging into one to envelop the body. Then transform them into fire, which burns the body until inner and outer become as one, utterly luminous.\n\nContinue from dawn until midday, then ingest qi one hundred twenty times to conclude.\n\nThis method was received by Du Guangping from the *Black-White Inner Radiance of Embryonic Essence* within the *Central Teachings of Jie Yan*. It repels all harm and grants immortality. First, abstain from sexual intercourse and all meat, the five pungent flavors, and other impure foods. After thirty years of practice, one may conceal the body and vanish, traveling five hundred *li* in a day.\n\n**Method of Ingesting the Heart-Opening Talisman**\nOn the first day of the lunar cycle, the fifteenth, and the twenty-seventh, face the sun and write in cinnabar. Bow twice and recite the prayer:\n\n*\"Five spirits open the heart,\nPiercing hearing to sever sound.\nThree hun souls gather essence,\nFirmly guarding the cinnabar heart.\nLet me never forget,\nAs the five viscera roam afar.\"*\n\nWhen finished, ingest the talisman, then swallow saliva five times and knock the teeth together five times. Do not let others witness this.\n\nThis method was taught by the Perfected Lord, from the *Heart-Opening Talisman of the Bright Hall’s Inner Canon*. Write the talisman in cinnabar on white paper beforehand, preparing about ten copies. On each appointed day, hold the talisman in the left hand while bowing and ingesting it.\n\n**Great Exorcism Against Malevolence**\nWhenever traversing perilous paths, passing through ghostly shrines, or encountering doubtful and difficult places, first press the tongue inward, swallow saliva three times, and with the second and third fingers of the left hand, pinch the area below the nostrils at the inner edge of the diaphragm thirty-six times—counting silently without lifting the fingers.\n\nKnock the teeth together seven times, then press the palms over the nose. With eyes closed, softly recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Vermilion Bird soars through the heavens,\nDivine might inwardly expands.\nThe four mountain springs stand guard,\nGhostly essences flee in terror.\nThe spirit-pool exhales its qi,\nEvil roots cower and hide.\nThe soul-terrace shines with fourfold brightness,\nThe jade chamber resounds with tinkling jade.\nThe jade perfected stand majestic,\nSeated to guard the Bright Hall.\nHands wave purple auroras,\nHead crowned with dawn’s light.\nReciting the *Cavern Canon*,\nIts thirty-nine chapters:\nWithin dwell the exorcising dragon and tiger,\nSevering peaks and cleaving ridges.\nFierce beasts and stampeding oxen,\nClutching blades and devouring spears.\nUplifting mountains and tolling heaven,\nDivine birds and venomous dragons,\nSix-headed serpents spewing fire,\nDevourers of ghost-kings.\nLightning walls and thunder’s father,\nSeizing stars and streaming meteors.\nOwls and krakens ablaze,\nDefying winds to stride crosswise.\nCelestial birds arrayed in ranks,\nAll stand beside me,\nSpitting fire a myriad fathoms,\nTo dispel all misfortune.\nHosts of spirits clear the path,\nSealing and banishing mountain hamlets.\nA thousand gods and a hundred numina,\nAll clasp hands and bow their heads.\nMarshals and constables bear lamps,\nBurning incense for me.\nWherever I go,\nTen thousand spirits welcome and serve.\"*\n\nWhen finished, knock the teeth together three times, then open the eyes and remove the hands.\n\nThis comes from the *Highest Great Exorcism of the Grand Cavern*, summoning celestial beasts to guard and causing a thousand spirits to tremble and submit.\n\n**Fengdu Great Exorcism**\nFirst, with eyes closed, visualize the five viscera until fully present. Knock the teeth together thirty-six times, then recite the incantation, tapping the teeth once for every four words as a cadence:\n\n*\"Heavenly Vanguard, Heavenly Vanguard,\nNine Primes’ slayer of youths,\nFive Ding marshals, High Diao Northern Duke,\nSeven Governors, Eight Numinous Ones,\nGrand Supreme expels the fierce.\nLong-skulled giant beasts,\nHands grasping the Emperor’s bell.\nWhite owls, three spirits,\nSternly driving leviathan dragons.\nMighty-sword spirit-kings,\nSevering evil and erasing traces.\nPurple qi ascends the heavens,\nCinnabar auroras surge and clash.\nDevouring demons, consuming ghosts,\nBodies transverse to drink the wind.\nAzure tongues, green teeth,\nFour-eyed old men.\nHeavenly Ding warriors,\nMightily subduing the southern fierce.\nHeavenly couriers, fierce and keen,\nNorthern guardians biting blades.\nThree hundred thousand soldiers,\nEncircle me in ninefold ranks.\nRepelling corpses a thousand *li*,\nDispelling all misfortune.\nDare any petty ghost\nApproach to witness my form?\nHeaven’s great axe,\nSevering the five forms of ghosts.\nFlame Emperor rends their flesh,\nNorthern Dipper burns their bones.\nFour Brightnesses shatter their skeletons,\nHeavenly Strategy annihilates their kind.\nA single stroke of the divine blade—\nTen thousand ghosts scatter and dissolve.\"*\n\nWhen finished, if reciting during daylight or night, or when afflicted by illness, this becomes a perpetual exorcism.",

      "translated_text": "Su Jun’s Transmitted Method for Conducting Affairs\n\nThe human head contains nine palaces. Three *fen* above the space between the eyebrows lies the *Shoucun* Palace. It has the Green Chamber and the Purple Portal, wherein two spirits reside. One *cun* above is the Bright Hall Palace, where the Luminous Youthful Perfected Official, the Luminous Mirror Spirit Lord, and the Luminous Female Perfected Official—three in all—reside. Two *cun* above is the Cavern Chamber Palace, where Wu Ying, Yellow Elder, and White Prime—three in all—reside. Three *cun* above is the Cinnabar Field and Mud-Pill Palace, where the Upper Prime Red Child and the Imperial Minister—two in all—reside. Four *cun* above is the Flowing Pearl Palace, where the Flowing Pearl Perfected Spirit resides. Five *cun* above is the Jade Emperor’s Palace, where the Jade Clarity Spirit Mother resides. One *cun* above the Bright Hall is the Heavenly Court Palace, where the Upper Clarity Perfected Maiden resides. One *cun* above the Cavern Chamber is the Ultimate Perfection Palace, where the Grand Ultimate Imperial Consort resides. One *cun* above the Cinnabar Field is the Mysterious Cinnabar Palace, where the Grand Unity Perfected Person resides. One *cun* above the Flowing Pearl is the Grand August Palace, where the Supreme Lord’s Queen resides.\n\nIn all, the head contains nine palaces, each one *cun* square. The Jade Emperor’s Palace, the Heavenly Court Palace, the Ultimate Perfection Palace, and the Grand August Palace are the four palaces of the feminine unity; their scriptures are transmitted only to those who have attained Perfection. The remaining five palaces have already circulated in the world, though the *Flowing Pearl Scripture* has not yet been seen.\n\nThe method of Guarding the One: On the midnight of the Beginning of Spring, sit facing east, close the breath, shut the eyes, clasp the fists upon the knees, and first visualize within the *Shoucun* Palace. On the left is the Crimson Terrace, within which is the Green Chamber, and in the chamber is a spirit clad in green robes, named Upright Heart, styled Cutting Square. On the right is the Yellow Gate, within which is the Purple Portal, and in the portal is a spirit clad in purple robes, named Tranquil Serenity, styled Dharma King. Both hold flowing golden bells. Call their names thrice and softly intone:\n\n“Purple Portal and Green Chamber,\nhome to two great spirits,\nhands grasping flowing bells,\nbodies seated upon wind and cloud,\nflanking and guarding the true Dao,\nbarring all that lies without.\nLet my thoughts and perceptions\nflow freely through the numinous gates,\nentering and exiting with integrity,\nascending through the nine portals,\nthat I may behold the Nine Perfected,\nthe honored ones of the Supreme.”\n\nNext, visualize within the Bright Hall Palace. On the left is the Luminous Youthful Perfected Official, named Mysterious Yang, styled Lesser Green. In the center is the Luminous Mirror Spirit Lord, named Illuminating Essence, styled Fourfold Brightness. On the right is the Luminous Female Perfected Official, named Subtle Yin, styled Lesser Prime. Their forms are all like those of infants, clad in green brocade robes, girdled with four crimson jade bells, mouths holding crimson jade mirrors. Kneeling upright and facing outward, they all exhale crimson *qi*, which envelops my body. Close the eyes and gently swallow it. Then make the jade bells ring, their sound reaching the Grand Ultimate. The mirrors emit crimson light ten thousand *zhang* long; in an instant, crimson *qi* coils about the body, transforming into fire that burns both within and without, merging light into one. Thereupon call their names thrice and click the teeth nine times.\n\nIf hungry or thirsty, visualize the three lords exhaling crimson *qi* into my mouth and inhale to swallow it. If walking in darkness, visualize the three lords emitting three beams of fire to illuminate the path ahead. If in peril or distress, also visualize the three lords ringing their jade bells, flashing and casting them forth.\n\nNext, visualize within the Cavern Chamber Palace. On the left is the Lord of No-Florescence, wearing a lotus-flower crown, bearing a purple dawn canopy, and girded with flowing golden bells. Seated facing outward, softly intone:\n\n“Three Primes’ flourishing *qi*,\nGrand Mystery’s purple dawn,\nYellow Gate and Golden Chamber,\nwithin dwell great spirits.\nLotus crown and purple canopy,\ndragon robes with tiger patterns,\nemerging from cinnabar, entering the void,\nsummoning yin and calling yang.\nThe Way of Heaven holds a truth,\nnamed No-Florescence.\nSupport me, give me life,\nand abide with me forever.”\n\nNext, visualize on the right the Lord of White Prime, wearing a yellow dawn-flower crown, dragon-patterned robes, and girded with the Spirit Tiger Talisman. Seated facing outward, softly intone:\n\n“Supreme divine essence,\nright at the Gate of Spirit,\ndragon robes and tiger sash,\nyellow dawn-flower crown.\nHolding registers and grasping scriptures,\nthis is White Prime.\nTravel with me,\nascend to the Yang Barrier,\nwander through the Nine Clarities,\nand return to rest in the Yellow Chamber.”\n\nThis is the method of the Cavern Chamber.\n\nFurthermore, regularly at the time of *qi*-generation after midnight, press the hands upon the knees, close the breath, shut the eyes, and inwardly gaze. Swallow saliva one hundred and twenty times, and visualize the Lord of No-Florescence, his attire and incantation as prescribed. Again, at sunrise, face east, bow twice, close the breath, shut the eyes, and inwardly gaze. Swallow saliva one hundred and twenty times, and visualize the Lord of White Prime, his attire and incantation as prescribed. Again, on the midnight after a *jiazi* day, let the hair down, apply powder, press the hands upon the knees, ingest *qi*, and swallow saliva one hundred and forty times. Then call the names of the two spirits. Listen inwardly for a response, as if someone answers, or for the sound of scripture recitation—this is the sign of resonance.\n\nAt the Beginning of Spring, face east; at the Beginning of Summer, face south; at the Beginning of Autumn, face west; at the Beginning of Winter, face north. On the midnight of the Spring Equinox, sit upright facing east, shut the eyes, and visualize the purple *qi* beneath the Northern Dipper, as thick as a bowstring, descending straight before me. Let the Three Ones, the Three Ministers, and myself—seven in all—with me at the center, all be enveloped. The handle of the Dipper’s seven stars points forward in a goose formation. Together we ride the purple *qi* upward to the Yang Brightness Star, enter, and sit together. All swallow the purple *qi* thirty times, then collectively inhale the green and purple *qi* descending from above, returning it to the Three Palaces. Focus the mind and visualize this, then intone:\n\n“Three honored Perfected Ones,\nlofty spirits of the Grand Mystery,\nYang Brightness governs spring,\nten thousand youths open the gates.\nCinnabar Prime governs summer,\ncrimson and purple merge in mist.\nYin Essence governs autumn,\nheavenly might in sixfold array.\nNorth Culmen governs winter,\nten thousand evils block and repel.\nFive Earths’ seasonal lords,\nthe celestial barriers of *wu* and *ji*.\nAll that they shatter is destroyed,\nall that they face is undefiled.\nRefine my seven *po*,\nharmonize my three *hun*,\nnurture my five viscera,\nthat I may attain the true.\nAscend and fly to the Upper Clarity,\nfloat upon the light of the Seven Primes.\nLive long and journey forth,\nwhistle and command a thousand spirits.”\n\nAt the Summer Solstice, face south and ascend the Cinnabar Prime Star;",

Cross your hands to cover your ears and intone:\n“The Red Child dwells within the palace,\nthe Nine Perfected abide in the chamber.\nHearken to the divine command,\ndiscern all that is inauspicious.\nThe flowing fire of the Great One\nshall extinguish the ten thousand evils.”\nPoint your fingers to your ear gates seven times.\n\nBefore eating or drinking, first visualize the One partaking of the meal, then proceed to eat. Upon finishing, silently intone:\n“As the hundred grains enter my stomach,\nthey merge with the spirit’s qi,\nfilling and replenishing blood and fluids.\nThe corpse-demons and malevolence perish,\nI shall live as long as heaven and earth,\nascend to the Golden Towers,\ncommand the Six Dings,\nwith divine youths attending in guard.”\n\nRegularly face the newly risen moon and bow twice, silently intoning:\n“Dark essence of the Great Yin,\nLady of the Radiant Moon,\nas your nascent light streams forth,\nillumine my Three Palaces.\nMay I ascend as an immortal,\nsoaring high through the eight directions,\nwherever I turn, may fortune and divine favor abide.”\n\nOn the days of the Eight Nodes, inscribe the True Talismans of the Three Origins in cinnabar. At dawn, face the sun, consume one talisman, and bow twice. Offer prayers as your heart desires. Begin on the first day of the lunar month and cease on the sixteenth, resuming with the next node as before. Also inscribe on white silk, place it in a brocade pouch, and wear it upon your head. After five years, you shall meet the True One.\n\nOn the first dawn of the new year, inscribe the Precious Chapter in blue-green ink, face north, bow twice, and swallow it. Also inscribe on white silk and wear it upon your left elbow. After eight years, the Three Ones shall all come to meet you. Take a gold tablet, nine inches long, four inches wide, and three fen thick, engrave it, and seal the spirits of the Five Peaks Mountain within your palm.\n\nThe method of refining form from the Red General Zi: at night, close your eyes, draw in light through your mouth, and visualize your body burning, permeated inside and out like fire. Practice this for three years, and you shall be able to enter fire. This is the Zhou Lord’s formula.\n\nThe method of guarding the Three Origins and True One within the Five Pecks of Grain: refine your essence for three months, and you shall faintly perceive your form attaining longevity. Guard the True Lord of the Mysterious Elixir for fourteen years, and you shall ascend with the Great One to the Web of the Seven Origins. After sixteen years, you shall reach the Upper Clarity, granted eighteen jade boys and eighteen jade maidens.\n\nThe Mao Lord’s transmitted method of practice:\nThe method of visualizing the Mysterious Perfected in the Hall of Light: in a quiet chamber, at dawn, close your eyes, place your hands upon your knees, and visualize the sun by day and the moon by night—each as large as a ring, positioned nine feet before your mouth. The sun’s color is crimson, with nine rays of purple light; the moon’s color is yellow, with ten rays of white light, straight as strings, entering your mouth. Within the sun and moon dwells the Jade Maiden of the Great Mystery and Upper Mystery’s Vermilion Mist, named Chan Xuan, styled Mi Zhen. She wears a crown of purple hibiscus and a robe of red brocade, facing you directly. She declares her name and title, then exhales crimson qi into your mouth. As she exhales, you swallow ninety times, sensing the sun and moon gradually nearing your face. The Jade Maiden’s mouth joins with yours, her qi and fluids entering your mouth. Silently intone:\n“Purple Perfected of the Grand Empyrean,\nYin spirit of the Hall of Light,\nessence born of sun and moon,\nJade Maiden Chan Xuan,\nfirst sprung from divine birth,\nstyled Mi Zhen,\nher head wrapped in purple blossoms,\ncrowned with a hibiscus spirit-diadem,\nher body draped in brocade,\nrobed in vermilion flying skirts,\nemerging from the sun, entering the moon,\nher celestial radiance profound and fragrant.\nFrom her mouth exhales crimson qi,\nirrigating my Three Origins.\nMy face beholds the Heavenly Well,\nsoftening the *po* and restraining the *hun*,\nmysterious fluids flowing,\nthe embryo’s essence perfected and whole.\nThe five viscera bloom with splendor,\nreversing age to restore a child’s countenance.\nOverseeing the ten thousand spirits,\nappointed as an official of the Lord of Destiny, ascending as a flying immortal.”\n\nVisualize the Jade Maiden’s mouth pouring fluids into yours, rinse and swallow them ninety times. If unable to perform this at the appointed time, visualize the Two Radiant Ones returning to the Hall of Light, the sun to the left and the moon to the right, their brilliance merging with the pupils of your eyes.\n\nOn the first day of the lunar month and your own life-day, at midnight face east. Inscribe the Yang Talisman in cinnabar on blue-green paper and the Yin Talisman in yellow on blue-green paper. Then close your eyes and visualize the sun’s purple light and the moon’s yellow qi within the Hall of Light, illuminating your entire body. With your left hand, hold the Yang Talisman, hold your breath, and silently intone:\n“The Two Radiant Ones stream their essence,\ntheir light suffusing my form.\nTo the left, I gather the sun’s splendor,\nto the right, I pluck the moon’s blossoms.\nMerging the two qi,\nirrigating the Three Fields.\nFlying mists and mysterious radiance\nfortify my numinous root,\ngranting me long life,\ncoeval with heaven and earth.”\n\nConsume the talisman, then bow twice. With your right hand, hold the Yin Talisman, hold your breath, and silently intone:\n“Yellow qi of Yin’s splendor,\nYang’s essence luminous and fresh.\nThe five spirits refined and softened,\nthe Three Lefts firming the fluids.\nThe Two Radiant Ones gleam resplendent,\nflowing mists irrigating the Perfected.\nYin and Yang’s qi interpenetrate,\nrevolving yellow to infuse the cinnabar.\nMy entire body transmutes,\nascending to the imperial palace.”\n\nConsume the talisman, then bow twice. Practice the Way of the Mysterious Perfected for five years, and the Jade Maiden of the Great Mystery shall descend, subject to your command, communicating with spirits and attaining the Perfected. Your body shall glow with jade’s radiance, you shall command the ten thousand spirits, and ascend to the Jade Chamber.\n\nThe Wang Lord’s transmitted method of practice:\nAt the time of arising qi, sit or lie as you wish. Knock your teeth nine times and silently intone:\n“Azure Teeth of the East,\npurple clouds streaming with mist,\nthe Three Pristine Ones lingering,\nmysterious frost and jade gauze.\nConsume the morning’s radiance,\ndrink the dawn’s blossoms.”\nPress your tongue against the outer edge of your upper lip, gather fluids, and swallow thirty times. Then knock your teeth nine times and intone:",
