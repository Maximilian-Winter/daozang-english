  "full_translation": "**The Fifty-Fifth Scroll of the *Ten Books on Cultivating the True: Annotated *Huangting Neijing Yujing***\n**Annotations and Preface to the *Huangting Neijing Yujing***\n*By Liangqiuxi*\n\nAll things take man as their master; man takes the One Heart as his foundation. Without a master, the Dharma does not arise; without the heart, the body cannot stand. The methods of the heart are manifold, their wondrous applications not singular. They possess the two bodies of being and non-being, responding to affairs as the moment demands. Thus, there are distinctions of ordinary and sagely, shallow and profound, foolish and wise, true and false—none but are discerned by the heart, for it governs the workings of perception.\n\nYet the Dao of all under heaven, though its paths diverge, converges in one; though its considerations are a hundredfold, they unite in a single end. Entering the wondrous from the hall is but two stages—expediency and reality—while embracing the near and tallying with the true, right and wrong become one vision.\n\nThere is the *Huangting Jing*, a secret treasure of Donghua. Truly, it is the essential subtlety of learning immortality, the root of feathered transformation. Though my study remains incomplete and my visualization but roughly grasped, I have modeled the myriad spirits into a single form. Its meaning encompasses four schools, its illumination clarifies seven characters; its pointers and metaphors speak of inner and outer in twofold discourse. In the pauses between poring over ancient texts and the breaths of exhalation and swallowing, I licked my brush, ground my ink, and thus bequeathed this humble offering.\n\nThe Great Lord of Fusang, the Divine King of Yang Valley, transmitted the *Huangting Neijing* to the Lady Wei of Nanyue. *Huang* is the color of the center; *Ting* is the midst of the four directions. Externally, it refers to the center of heaven, the center of man, and the center of earth; internally, it refers to the center of the brain, the center of the heart, and the center of the spleen. Thus, it is called *Huangting*. *Nei* is the heart; *Jing* is the form and image. Externally, it compares to the colors of the sun, moon, stars, clouds, and rosy dawn; internally, it compares to the forms of sinews, bones, and the viscera. The heart dwells within the body, storing and observing the images and colors of the whole—thus, it is called *Neijing*.\n\nAnother name is *Qin Xin* (\"Lute Heart\"). *Qin* means harmony; reciting it harmonizes the six palaces and pacifies the heart-spirit, enabling one to attain immortality. Another name is *The Great Emperor’s Golden Book*. The Great Lord of Fusang recites this scripture in his palace, inscribing it on golden tablets—hence, it is called *Golden Book*. Another name is *The Jade Chapters of Donghua*. Donghua is the name of the palaces of the eastern direction. In the Eastern Sea dwells the Green Lad, where jade maidens and immortals all chant and recite it, inscribing it on jade tablets—thus, it is called *Jade Chapters*.\n\nOne should purify oneself for ninety days and recite it ten thousand times, thereby harmonizing the three *hun*, refining the seven *po*, expelling the Three Corpses, and pacifying the six palaces. The five viscera will flourish, one will return to the state of an infant, and the hundred illnesses cannot harm, nor can calamities injure. When the ten thousand recitations are complete, one will naturally perceive spirits and gods with penetrating vision and internally behold the intestines and stomach, seeing the five viscera. At that time, the Perfected of the Yellow Court and the Jade Maiden of Donghua will teach you the arts of immortality.\n\nThose who constantly chant it will find their spirit-chamber bright and upright, their primordial embryo at peace, their numinous fluids flowing freely, their hundred passages harmonized and smooth, their blood and marrow abundant, their intestines and stomach empty yet full, their five viscera blossoming with radiance, their ears and eyes keen, their white hair returning to black, and their decayed teeth regrowing. As for repelling the tumult of demonic illnesses, it is because I have already obtained the names of the six wefts of the *hun*-essence.\n\nThe oral instructions of Qingxu Yuzhen state: The *Huangting Jing* is the secret teaching of the Great Lord of Fusang’s golden book for refining the true. Those who read and recite it must do so in a separate chamber, burning incense and maintaining purity before taking it up. This scripture repels the hundred demons. If one enters mountains and forests or dark, empty places and the heart trembles in fear, one should face north, recite the scripture once, and the spirit will settle, the mind will calm, as if traveling with a thousand companions. If one recites it ten thousand times, one’s eyes will see the five viscera and intestines, and the gods of all under heaven will be at one’s command. If afflicted by illness, one should visualize and recite it, and even those on the verge of death will recover.\n\nIn general, one must abstain from the six livestock, fishy and rank foods, the five pungent vegetables, and treading upon or covering filth. If one has trodden upon or covered filth, one should bathe, rinse the mouth, burn incense to the left and right, and recite the scripture once—then the hundred illnesses will be dispelled.\n\n**First Chapter of the Shangqing Section**\nBefore the Purple Radiance of the Void Sovereign of Shangqing...\n\nWithin the Three Clarities’ realms lie the Grand Clarity, the Highest Clarity, and the Jade Clarity. These Three Clarities encompass the abodes of all great sages. According to the *Scripture of the Jade Terrace*, the Void Sovereign governs the domain of the Great Dao Lord—this is the realm of the Great Dao, which embraces the Three Clarities. The *Ten Titles of the Mystic Capital* further states: the Supreme Numinous Void Sovereign, the Heavenly Venerable, is the primordial title of the Originator. The Dao Lord, desiring to illuminate the origin of the seven-character verse within the Purple Radiance’s palace—also called the Palace of Purple Jade or the Crimson-White-Purple Imperial Palace—thus reveals the title of the Supreme Great Dao Jade Imperial Lord. \"Supreme\" denotes the highest reverence; as the *Scripture of Fundamental Conduct* records, this is the title of the Originator and the Five Elders. The Jade Dawn Lord is the title of the Yellow Lord.\n\nWhen dwelling in the Palace of Elixir Pearls to compose seven-character verses, the *Scripture of Esoteric Essentials* describes the immortal palaces: the Hall of Liao-Yang, the Gate of Elixir Pearls, the Chambers of Emerald Clouds, where the Dao Lord expounds the scriptures. This mirrors the human body’s inherent structure.\n\nDispersing and transforming the five forms, transmuting into myriad spirits—this refers to the ability to transform, relinquishing cleverness and wisdom, shedding form and intellect, merging with the Great Dao. Preceding essence and following traces, one temporarily employs spirit as a vessel. Spirit responds to circumstances, dispersing into five forms and transmuting into myriad spirits. Thus, the *Inner Chapter* of the *Yellow Court* derives its name from this principle.\n\nThe zither-heart in triple layers dances with the embryonic immortal—\"zither\" signifies harmony, \"layers\" denote accumulation. By harmonizing and accumulating the Three Elixir Fields into unity, the embryonic immortal resembles one in fetal breathing, where breath exists yet remains unexhaled. The nine qi radiate brilliance between the heavens. Within the Three Fields dwell nine qi, resplendent and illuminating all without exception. The *Scripture of the Great Cavern* states: the Three Elixir Fields, Three Origins, and Three Cavern Chambers combine into nine palaces, wherein reside the Heavenly Sovereigns. The nine po transform into nine qi, which further manifest as nine spirits.\n\nThe spirit’s canopy—youthful lads—generates purple mist. Through contemplation and visualization, one employs the eyes as instruments.\n\nThe following text states: the brows are called the \"flowering canopy\" shading the luminous pearls. The \"spirit’s canopy\" refers to the brows; the \"luminous pearls,\" to the pupils of the eyes. The purple mist is the essence of subtle qi. This is called the *Jade Scripture*, which may be studied with precision. When writing arises from traces, focus leads to comprehension. Chanting it ten thousand times ascends one to the Three Heavens—when essence is perfected and spirit is replete, one’s name is inscribed in the Three Clarities. A thousand disasters dissipate, and a hundred illnesses heal, for both essence and spirit are fully present. One need not fear the ferocity of tigers and wolves, for no harm remains. This also reverses aging and extends longevity. This single chapter entirely expounds the Dao of the Yellow Court.\n\n**Chapter Two: Above the Yellow Court**\nAbove lies the ethereal soul, below the Pass of Origin. The \"ethereal soul\" pertains to heaven; the \"Pass of Origin,\" to earth. The soul is formless, while the Pass of Origin has substance—man models himself upon heaven and earth. On the left is Lesser Yang, on the right Greater Yin: left is east, right is west; the east gives birth, the west brings death. Behind lies the Hidden Gate, before the Gate of Life. \"Before\" is south; \"behind,\" north. The Hidden Gate refers to the two posterior orifices, signifying concealment. The Gate of Life refers to the seven anterior orifices, through which life is sustained. Together, they form the nine orifices. Exhale the sun, inhale the moon—store this in your breath. The sun and moon are the essence of yin and yang; exhale to the left, inhale to the right. The body possesses the qi of yin and yang, modeling itself upon the qi of heaven and earth. Exhalation is the issuing breath, inhalation the drawing breath; between them, the heart must store this awareness. The primordial qi unites with the constellations’ divisions. Primordial qi is one. Align the heart with the Dao, and visualize the luminous radiance of the sun, moon, and stars, arrayed and shining, so that the body’s divisions become distinct and merge with heaven. Purple mist rises and falls amid the Three Pure Clouds. The purple mist is the qi of the eyes’ essence. Visualize the Three Elixir Fields above and below, all suffused with white qi, flowing as one. It is also said: the eyes’ light possesses three colors—purple, azure, and green—forming the Three Pure Clouds. The *Scriptures of the Immortals* state: the incantation of Lady Cloud-Forest says, \"Sun and moon youths, the essence of the Three Clouds and the Two Eyes’ True Lords.\" Irrigate the Five Flowers to plant the numinous root. The qi of the Pure Clouds becomes jade liquid in the mouth; swallowing it irrigates the Five Flowers—the finest essences of the five viscera. The \"numinous root\" is the root of life, from which growth is planted. The seven fluids flow unimpeded between the jaws. The fluids of the seven orifices flow freely up and down, surging upward and circling downward, between the jaws and within the Hall of Light. Purple encircles yellow to enter the Elixir Field. This is an internal metaphor. The spleen’s qi is yellow; the eyes’ qi is purple. The seven fluids circulate, embracing yellow and returning with purple, entering and exiting with each breath to merge in the Elixir Field. There are three Elixir Fields, the roots of the numinous and the vital. According to the *Scripture of the Great Cavern*: three *fen* within the space between the brows form the Twin Elixir Fields; three *fen* into the bone’s edge form the Terrace and Gate, with the Azure Chamber on the left and the Purple Portal on the right, where two spirits reside. One *cun* inward from between the brows lies the Hall of Light, where the Luminous Youth Lord resides on the left, the Luminous Maiden Lord on the right, and the Mirror Spirit Lord in the center. Two *cun* inward lies the Cavern Chamber, where the Peerless Lord resides on the left, the White Origin Lord on the right, and the Yellow Elder Lord in the center. Three *cun* inward lies the Elixir Field, also called the Muddy Pellet Palace, where the Upper Origin Crimson Youth Lord resides on the left, and the Imperial Minister Lord on the right. Four *cun* inward lies the Flowing Pearl Palace, where the Flowing Pearl True Lord resides. Five *cun* inward lies the Jade Emperor’s Palace, where the Jade Clarity True Mother resides. One *cun* above the Hall of Light lies the Heavenly Court Palace, where the Upper Clarity True Maiden resides. One *cun* directly above the Cavern Chamber lies the Ultimate Truth Palace, where the Supreme Ultimate Emperor Lord resides. One *cun* directly above the Elixir Field lies the Elixir Mystery Palace, where the Central Yellow Grand Unity Lord resides. Two *cun* directly above the Flowing Pearl Palace lies the Supreme Sovereign Palace, where the Supreme Lord resides—masculine as yang, feminine as yin. Both men and women may cultivate this. The secluded chamber’s inner light illuminates the Gate of Yang. Within the hidden chamber, inwardly contemplate and store the heart’s intent; the eyes’ clarity discerns all, as if the sun and moon shine. The spirit is said to be without direction. The heart-spirit is boundless; when stored, it exists; when forgotten, it vanishes.\n\n**Chapter Three: The Mouth**\nThe mouth is the Jade Pool and the Palace of Grand Harmony. The liquid in the mouth is jade fluid, also called sweet spring or jade nectar, stored as water in the pool. The hundred joints are harmonized and supple, the five viscera balanced and at ease—all governed by the mouth as their palace lord. One version reads \"Palace of Grand Harmony,\" though this disrupts the rhyme. The *Scripture of the Great Cavern* states: visualize within the stomach’s opening a girl in infant form, unclothed, standing upright in the stomach’s tube, her mouth open to receive the soul’s liquid. Inhale the five qi, then fill the mouth with them, along with the inner and outer fluids, and swallow, sending them straight into the Mysterious Maiden’s mouth. After five repetitions, knock the teeth together three times and softly recite: \"Jade Clarity, exalted above the Nine Heavens and Nine Spirits, transform into a spirit maiden and descend into the stomach’s purity. Gold harmonizes with jade, the heart is at ease, the spirit bright. Feast upon the sun’s essence, and golden radiance fills the body.\" Rinse and swallow the numinous liquid, and no disaster shall approach. The true qi of the numinous liquid repels the perverse. The body generates radiant light, its qi fragrant as orchids. Without consuming the five grains, the body remains free of filth. A hundred evils are extinguished, and the countenance is refined as jade. Cultivate this diligently, and ascend to the Broad Cold Palace. The Broad Cold is the name of a celestial palace in the north. On the winter solstice, the moon retreats to the Broad Cold Palace, where it nurtures the moon’s soul in that land. Heavenly beings gather the essence of its splendor to distinguish the light of the sun and moon. Cultivate by day and night without sleep, and you shall become a true one. In movement, refine; in stillness, stabilize—thus one becomes a true person. Thunder roars and lightning flashes, yet the spirit remains undisturbed. Harmonize spirit and regulate qi; essence and soul are serene and joyful. Though thunder shakes, there is no fear. It is also said: thunder is lightning’s excitation, the result of knocking the teeth and storing thought—this is the spirit’s work, not to be called \"undisturbed.\"\n\n**Chapter Four: The Yellow Court**\n\nThe Yellow Court’s inner maiden wears brocade robes—\nThe Yellow Court’s inner maiden refers to the Dao Mother;\nThe Yellow Court’s perfected one refers to the Dao Father,\nboth embodied within the self.\nThe brocade robes bear the five colors,\nsignifying the true qi of the five viscera.\nWithin the Three Courts, they are fully present.\n\nPurple auroras trail her skirts like drifting clouds—\nThe *Scripture of the Ten Directions* states:\nThe Most High Jade Emperor wears a robe of luminous, cloud-woven skirts,\nthe raiment of immortals.\n\nCinnabar and azure, green branches with jade-like boughs,\nwhere the five-colored essences intertwine to form the immortal’s garb.\nThe seven-tiered jade lock seals the double doors—\nan outer metaphor.\nThe seven apertures open and close like bolts,\nused with the Dao, never sealed in vain.\nThe lock is adorned with its key.\nTo store the spirit, cross the hands and close the eyes—\nthus sealing the two doors.\n\nDouble-shuttered, the golden gate guards the secret mechanism—\n\"Golden\" denotes firmness and strength.\nThe *Scripture of Laozi* says:\n\"One skilled in closure needs no bolt yet cannot be opened,\"\nspeaking of the adept who guards the spirit and never leaks it wantonly.\n\nThe dark spring flows deep within the towering, secluded gate—\nThe dark spring is the fluid within the mouth,\nalso called Jade Brew, Jade Liquid, or Jade Spring.\nThe space between the eyes is the Gate Court;\nthe space between the kidneys is the Secluded Gate,\nlike the twin pillars of a gate’s frame,\nwith the Dao at its center.\nThe kidneys lie within, hence called the Secluded Gate.\nThough the kidneys rest below the five viscera,\nwhen the form is subdued and the spirit stored,\nthey rise above the Cinnabar Field—\nthus called \"towering.\"\n\nWithin the Three Fields, the essence and qi are subtle—\nan internal allusion.\nIn the Cinnabar Field, the spirit and qi transform,\nresponding to the heart’s intent,\nneither existing nor non-existing,\nbeyond all doing.\nLike a dragon entering mystery, its foundation is orderly,\nso with qi, the heart governs.\nThus, the image is established—\nutter stillness, utter subtlety,\nbeyond reckoning.\nThe *Scripture of the Dao’s Mechanism* states:\n\"Heaven has its Three Lights: sun, moon, and stars;\nhumans have their Three Treasures: the Three Cinnabar Fields.\"\nIn the Cinnabar Field’s qi,\nleft is blue, right is yellow,\nabove is white, below is black.\n\nThe graceful maiden, lithe and veiled in celestial radiance—\nThe *True Records* say:\nThe graceful maiden is the name of the ear’s spirit.\nWhen the ear hears clearly, its brightness veils the dark glow.\n\nThe layered hall shines resplendent, displaying the Eight Might—\nThe layered hall is the name of the throat,\nalso called the layered tower or layered rings.\nThis scripture states:\n\"The Crimson Palace’s layered tower has twelve tiers.\"\nThe Crimson Palace is the heart.\nThe throat lies above the heart, hence called the layered hall.\nThe throat is the path of fluids,\nflowing to nourish the whole body,\nilluminating the eight directions.\nThe spirits of the eight directions are called the Eight Might.\n\nThe Heavenly Court and Earthly Gate stand newly arrayed like axes—\nThe space between the brows is the Heavenly Court.\nThe incantation of Lady Ziwei says:\n\"Open the Heavenly Court to grant me longevity.\"\n\"Newly arrayed like axes\" speaks of vigor and strength.\n\nThe Spirit Terrace stands firm, never decaying—\nThe heart is the Spirit Terrace,\nwhere the divine spirit resides.\nIn stillness, guard the One;\nin movement, store the spirit.\nWhen the spirit is complete and settled,\nit never declines.\n\n**Chapter Five: The Central Pool**\n\nThe Central Pool’s inner spirit wears crimson pearls—\nThe gallbladder is the Central Pool;\nthe tongue is the Flower Pool;\nthe lower abdomen is the Jade Pool—\nall names for the Three Pools.\nThe *Chapter on the Gallbladder* states:\n\"The dragon banner spans the sky, casting fire bells.\"\nThe crimson pearls refer to the fire bells.\n\nCinnabar brocade and cloud-woven robes bear the tiger tally—\nThe cinnabar brocade and cloud-woven robes\nare the colors of the heart and lungs,\nsituated above the gallbladder,\nhence called cloud-woven robes and tiger tally.\nThe *Scripture of the Nine Perfected* says:\n\"The Yellow Elder Lord’s raiment bears\nthe dark dragon and divine tiger tally,\ngirded with flowing golden bells—\nthe attire of the Dao Lord.\"\n\nThe three-inch ford is where the numinous dwells—\nan internal allusion.\n\nThe navel lies above the womb, hence called the \"horizontal ford.\" Three inches below the navel is the Cinnabar Field, where the Perfected and the Red Child reside. Concealed within, misty and dense, they support one another—\nThis refers to the forms of man and woman. Their hidden union is the natural Dao.\nAccording to the *Record of Inner and Outer Divine Mushrooms*:\n\"The fluids of the five viscera become mushrooms.\" This is the \"hidden mushroom,\" also called the \"inner mushroom.\"\n\n**Heavenly Pillar Chapter VI**\nTend the essence of the Heavenly Pillar with care—\nThe Heavenly Pillar is the nose, also called the Heavenly Terrace. The *Scripture of Dissolution and Rubbing* states: \"Frequently press the sides of the nose to balance the qi, which is called irrigating the Central Peak and inscribing the Emperor’s Register.\"\nOnce the numinous dwelling is purified, the Jade Emperor roams—\nThe face is the numinous dwelling, also called the Heavenly Abode. It is where the brows, eyes, and mouth reside, hence called the abode. Refine it to perfection, and the immortals will wander there. The *Great Cavern Scripture* says: \"The face is the foot-square abode,\" or sometimes called the \"crimson marsh.\"\nKeep the pathways unobstructed without cease—\nThe *Scripture of Great Simplicity and Cinnabar Radiance* states: \"On the face, constantly rub with both hands, following its contours without pause, to unblock the qi and vessels of the ears, eyes, and mouth.\"\nThe brows are named the Floral Canopy, shading the bright pearls—\nThe bright pearls are the eyes.\nThe Nine Darks and sun-moon illumine the hollow origin—\nThe *Five Spirits’ Conduct* states: \"Above the brows, trace the purple palace of the Hall of Light, with the sun on the left and the moon on the right.\" The *Jade Calendar Scripture* also says: \"Above the Great Clarity are nine-tiered canopies of five-colored blossoms; the human body has them too. One should visualize the pupils as bright as the sun and moon.\"\nWithin the abode dwells the Perfected, ever clad in cinnabar—\nThe True Dragon, spirit of the heart, is the Crimson-Walled Youth, also called the True One, the Red Child, the Child Cinnabar, or the Perfected. Visualizing him keeps him ever present, responding to the heart and reflecting its qi and color.\nIf one can truly see him, no illness will arise—\nMaster Primal Yang said: \"Constantly visualize the heart’s spirit, and there will be no sickness.\"\nCrimson pearls and numinous skirts, radiant and splendid—\nThe attire and colors of the heart’s spirit, an external metaphor.\nBeneath the tongue, the Dark Gullet is the shore of life and death—\nAn internal allusion. The Dark Gullet is the shore where fluids and essence flow. The *Root Scripture* states: \"The Dark Gullet is the qi vessel that receives the essence tally.\"\nExhaling clarity and inhaling mystery, the two qi shine—\nThis refers to the exhalation and inhalation of yin and yang qi, resplendent and luminous.\nIf you encounter this, you will ascend to the Celestial Han.\n\n**Supreme Dao Chapter VII**\nThe Supreme Dao is not burdensome; concentrate to preserve the true—\nDevotion brings attainment.\nThe Mud Pill and every joint have their spirits—\nSpirits are the wonders of the myriad things, named according to their forms.\nHair and gray blossoms are called Great Primal—\nWhite and black together are called gray, residing at the very top, hence the Great Primal.\nThe spirit of the brain’s essence-root is called Mud Pill—\nThe palace of the Cinnabar Field, the union of the Yellow Court, the master of the Grotto Chamber, the root of yin and yang—this is the image of the brain’s Mud Pill.\nThe spirit of the eyes’ clarity is called Radiant Mystery—\nThe eyes are likened to the sun and moon, atop the head, hence \"clarity above.\" Radiant Mystery is the pure color of the youthful spirit. An internal allusion.\nThe spirit of the nose’s jade ridge is called Numinous Firmness—\nThe ridge’s bone resembles jade, and the spirit’s qi connects to heaven, entering and exiting without exhaustion, hence Numinous Firmness.\nThe spirit of the ears’ emptiness is called Secluded Field—\nEmptiness and seclusion, where hearing is acute and the spirit resides, hence the Secluded Field.\nThe spirit of the tongue’s life-channel is called Proper Order—\nSwallowing fluids with the tongue, life’s essence flows unimpeded. Regulating the five flavors, each has its proper principle.\nThe spirit of the teeth’s blade-peaks is called Net-Thousand—\nThe teeth are firm and sharp, like blades that cut and crush, netting all things for consumption.\nThe spirit of the face governs the Mud Pill—\nThe brain’s spirit is the master of the hundred spirits of the Cinnabar Field.\nThe Nine Perfected of the Mud Pill each have their chambers—\nThe *Great Cavern Scripture* states: \"The Three Primes conceal transformations to form the Three Palaces; three times three makes nine, hence the Three Cinnabar Fields.\" There are also the Three Caverns and the Fish Union, totaling one or two Primes to make the Nine Palaces, where the Nine Perfected spirits reside. Three nines are twenty-seven spirits; when harmonized with a person, they should be visualized—these are also called the Nine August Ones. The Nine Souls transform into nine qi, becoming nine spirits, each dwelling in a grotto chamber.\nThe chambers are one inch square, situated within—\nEach chamber is one inch, and the brain has nine lobes.\nTogether they wear purple robes and flying gauze skirts—\nThe attire of the Nine Perfected mirrors the colors of qi, light as flight.\nSimply contemplate one division, and longevity will be endless—\nVisualizing the Nine Perfected is the way to immortality.\nThey do not each reside separately within the brain—\nThe spirits gather in the Cinnabar Field, where the Spring Spirit dwells.\nTheir seats are arrayed facing outward—\nThe spirits govern the Cinnabar Field but face outward to ward off misfortune. The *Eight Simplicities Scripture* states: \"The Perfected have nine ranks, facing outward in their positions: the Supreme Perfected face upward, the High Perfected south, the Great Perfected east, the Spirit Perfected west, the Mysterious Perfected north, the Immortal Perfected northeast, the Celestial Perfected southeast, the Void Perfected southwest, and the Utmost Perfected northwest.\" The Celestial Perfected see without looking, hear without listening, rectify without speaking, and follow without moving.\nTheir existence depends on the heart’s proper alignment—\nWhen the heart contemplates the Mysterious Perfected, inner and outer respond.\n\n**Heart Spirit Chapter VIII**\nThe spirit of the heart, Cinnabar Prime, is called Guarding Numinous—\nAn internal metaphor. The heart is the primal organ of the viscera, the color of southern fire, the abode of the spirit’s handle, hence Guarding Numinous.\nThe spirit of the lungs, Luminous Florescence, is called Empty Accomplishment—\nThe lungs are the heart’s floral canopy, luminous white, the color of western metal. The lungs’ color is white, their substance light and empty, hence Empty Accomplishment.\nThe spirit of the liver, Dragon Mist, is called Containing Clarity—\nThe liver’s position is the phase of wood, the color of the eastern Azure Dragon. Among the viscera, it governs the eyes. The sun rises in the east, hence Containing Clarity.\n\nThe misty canopy governs clarity and turbidity—\n*Yiyu* is the image of wood; when it meets fire, smoke arises; when it meets yang, qi becomes clear. Clarity brings brightness to the eyes; turbidity brings dimness.\n\nThe spirit of the kidneys, Profound Darkness, is called Nurturing Infant—\nThe kidneys belong to water, hence *Profound Darkness*. Kidney essence generates the child, hence *Nurturing Infant*.\n\nThe spirit of the spleen, Ever-Present, is called Soul-Resting—\nThe spleen occupies the central earth phase, hence *Ever-Present*, the Yellow Court’s palace. The spleen’s grinding digests food, its spirit-power mirrors strength, hence *Soul-Resting*.\n\nThe spirit of the gallbladder, Dragon Radiance, is called Majestic Clarity—\nThe gallbladder’s color is azure light, hence *Dragon Radiance*; it governs courage and vigor, hence *Majestic Clarity*. Externally, it draws from the eastern Azure Dragon’s thunderous resonance.\n\nThe six bowels and five viscera embody the spirits’ essence—\nThey sustain the entire body; none may be discarded, hence *the spirits’ essence*. The heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys are the five viscera; the stomach, large intestine, small intestine, bladder, triple burner, and gallbladder are the six bowels. The term *bowel* resembles a prefecture’s storehouse, taking the meaning of receiving things, hence *bowel*. The *viscera* each possess a distinct substance yet are collectively stored within the body, hence *viscera*. Much has been said of the triple burner, yet its true nature remains obscure—it lies above the heart, liver, and lungs, within the connecting vessels. The *Central Yellow Scripture* states: “The heart, liver, and lungs are the triple burner,” pointing to its location.\n\nYet according to the five phases’ colors, the spleen governs the five viscera—why then is the heart considered their master?\nThe answer: The heart resides at the center of the five viscera; its substance is emptiness and receptivity, the body of spirit-awareness and the source of function. Thus, it governs the directions and manifests its power, moving and acting to attain its numinous nature. It cannot be spoken in terms of images or numbers, nor grasped through material analogy—all is the Dao of spontaneity.\n\nAll operate within the heart, circulating the celestial scriptures—\nThe five viscera and six bowels each have their offices, modeling heaven and earth, aligning with yin and yang, the natural Dao of resonance and governance, hence *circulating the celestial scriptures*.\n\nPreserve them day and night to attain longevity—\nBy visualizing these five spirits with their corresponding colors, one holds fast to the undying Dao.\n\nThe *Scripture of Immortals* states: Envision the qi of the five viscera transforming into five-colored clouds, covering the body from above. The sun resides before you, the moon behind; the Azure Dragon to the left, the White Tiger to the right; the Vermilion Bird in front, the Dark Warrior behind—this is the Dao of dispelling evil and attaining longevity.\n\n**Lung Section Chapter IX**\nThe lung’s palace resembles a floral canopy—\nA golden palace, for the lungs stand above the five viscera, their lobes like a canopy.\n\nBelow sits a youth within the Jade Tower—\nThe youth is named *Luminous Florescence*; the lungs’ form is canopy-like, hence described as below. The *Jade Tower* refers to the white qi within the kidneys, connecting upward to the lungs.\n\nThe Seven Origins’ child governs qi-regulation—\nMaster Yuan Yang states: The Lords of the Seven Origins bear armor and hold talismans, repelling inauspicious evil and distributing qi to the seven orifices, governing the acuity of ears and eyes. The *Seven Origins* are the primordial qi beyond the seven orifices.\n\nExternally corresponding to the Central Peak’s nose and navel—\nThe *Central Peak* is the nose. It is also the navel, the navel being Kunlun. The nose is the gateway of the seven orifices, its position like that of a master.\n\nAdorned in silken robes with a yellow-cloud sash—\n*Silken* is the color of the lung’s membrane. The yellow membrane spreads and entwines, resembling cloud-like patterns.\n\nWhen breathing becomes labored and the body feels unwell—\nThis occurs at times.\n\nSwiftly visualize White Prime harmonizing the six qi—\nWhite Prime Lord governs the lung palace. The *Great Cavern Scripture* states: “White Prime Lord resides to the right of the Cavern Chamber.”\n\nThe divine immortals’ long vision knows no harm—\nEvil does not invade the upright.\n\nThe practice unceasing—form does not stagnate.\nConstantly abiding in this Dao, the body’s qi flourishes in splendor.\nThis is the attainment of sincere cultivation.\n\n**Chapter Ten: The Heart Section**\n\nThe Heart Section’s palace holds a lotus in bud—\nA fire palace, the heart’s essence resembles an unopened lotus flower.\n\nBelow dwells the youthful Dan Yuan’s household—\nThe heart spirit, Dan Yuan, guards the numinous spirit within the heart.\n*Below* refers to its position beneath the canopy.\n\nIt governs the harmony of cold and heat, the flourishing of defense and nourishment—\nCold and heat signify the principles of yin-yang, stillness and dryness.\nOne constantly harmonizes them to nourish and defend the body.\nThe *Laozi Scripture* states: “Stillness prevails over cold, dryness overcomes heat; clarity and stillness are the true standards of the world.”\n\nCrimson brocade robes draped in jade gauze—\nThe heart resembles *li*.\nCrimson brocade represents the outer yang of the robes.\nJade gauze draped over signifies inner yin.\n\nGolden bells and vermilion sashes seated in tranquil repose—\nGolden bells symbolize the inner elixir.\nVermilion sashes represent the blood vessels.\n*Seated in tranquil repose* describes the spirit’s serenity.\nThe *Nine Perfected Scripture* states: “The Yellow and Old Lords wear flowing-gold bells.”\n\nRegulating blood and governing life, the body does not wither—\nWith the heart at peace and the body harmonized, illness does not arise.\n\nExternally, it manifests in the mouth and tongue, exhaling the five blossoms—\nThe heart governs the mouth and tongue, exhaling and inhaling the essences of the five viscera, discerning the flavors of the five phases; thus it is said to externally correspond to the five tastes.\nWhen on the verge of death, calling upon it brings revival—\nWhen one is gravely ill, one should visualize the Cinnabar Prime Youth, clad in vermilion robes and crimson cap, to rescue and protect.\nWith long practice, one soars upon the great rosy clouds.\n\n**Chapter Eleven: The Liver Section**\n\nThe liver’s palace is wrapped in layers of emerald—\nA wooden abode, the liver’s hue is azure-green, an image of the great and small enfolded.\nBelow resides the Azure Youth, Divine Lord—\nThe liver holds the eastern position of wood, master of green; hence he is called the Azure Youth.\nTo the left is the Lord’s Son, also named Containing Brilliance, above whom hangs a floral canopy; thus he is said to dwell below.\nHe governs the gates and mirrors, the origin of clarity—\nThe liver presides over the three months of spring, the root and beginning of yang; its orifice governs the eyes, the gate and mirror of the five phases; thus it is the origin of clarity.\nClad in azure brocade robes, girded with jade bells—\nAzure brocade is the liver’s color.\nJade bells symbolize the white vessels hanging in resemblance.\nThe *Scripture of Ascending Mystery* states: “The Three Heavens and Five Emperors all wear great jade pendants.”\nThe *Scripture of Plain Radiance* states: “The Lord of Numinous Brilliance wears azure brocade and cinnabar robes, the raiment of immortals.”\n\nHarmonizing and restraining the hun and po, balancing the fluids—\nThis refers to internal matters.\nWhen spring’s warmth is gentle, the myriad things are born.\nExternally, it corresponds to the eyes, the essence of sun and moon—\nThe liver externally governs the eyes, the left like the sun, the right like the moon.\nWhen afflicted by the hundred diseases, visualize the Peerless Hero—\nWhen various illnesses assail, simply visualize the Peerless Hero, the Lord’s Son.\nPracticing together for seven days restores fullness—\nAll five viscera are visualized together; thus it is said to practice in unison.\nSeven days form one cycle, one journey.\nWhen near death, contemplating the spirit revives the dying—\nWhen on the brink of death, visualize the liver’s spirit, the azure-robed youth, and recovery follows.\nGathering the hun and returning the po ensures eternal stability—\nThe *Numinous Writ of the Great Tenuity* states: “On the third, thirteenth, and twenty-third evenings of each month, the three hun depart the body to wander outside. To gather them, one should lie supine without a pillow, stretch the feet, cross the hands over the heart, close the eyes, hold the breath for three cycles, and click the teeth three times. Upon completion, visualize a red qi the size of a chicken’s egg emerging from within the heart and passing through the throat. The red qi expands, enveloping the body and transforming into fire, burning the body all around until a slight warmth is felt. Then call the names of the three hun: *Shuangling*, *Taiguang*, and *Youjing*, and softly recite the incantation: *‘Within the Yellow Beginning of the Great Tenuity Palace, internally refine the three hun. May Taiguang be at peace, the numinous jade treasure, born with me, not acting recklessly. The overseer is the Great Void. If you wish to fly and wander, go only to the Upper Clarity. If hungry or thirsty, drink the mysterious water and jade essence.’*\n\nFurthermore, on the new moon, full moon, and dark moon, when the luminous po are abundant and intermingling, practice the method of refining and returning the essence. Lie supine with feet stretched, cover the ears with the palms so the roots of the fingers encircle the nape, hold the breath seven times, and click the teeth seven times. Visualize a white qi the size of a small bean at the tip of the nose, gradually expanding until it crowns the body in nine layers. Suddenly, the qi transforms into two azure dragons within the eyes, white tigers in the nostrils, a vermilion phoenix above the heart, a dark turtle beneath the left foot, and a flying serpent beneath the right foot. Two jade maidens in brocade robes hold flames of fire at the gates of the ears. Upon completion, swallow the saliva seven times and call the names of the seven po: *Shigou*, *Fushi*, *Queyin*, *Tianzei*, *Duwei*, and *Choufei*. Then recite the incantation: *‘The plain qi returns ninefold, restraining the hun and dispelling wickedness. The Celestial Hound guards the gate, the Maiden of Jade holds the pass. Refine the po to harmony, abiding with me in peace, not acting recklessly. Observe and examine the source of form. If hungry or thirsty, you may drink the moon’s yellow and the sun’s cinnabar.’*\n\n**Chapter Twelve: The Kidney Section**\n\nThe kidney’s palace is a circular gate of profound mystery—\n\nThe kidney’s palace is a water-official’s domain.\nThe \"circular gate of profound mystery\" describes the form of the two kidneys.\n*Xuan* is the color of water, an inner image used in analogy.\nWithin resides the Youth of Darkest Mystery ascending to the Upper Mystery.\nThe kidneys govern the Lower Mystery, their spirit named *Xuanming*, styled *Yuying*.\nThe heart governs the Upper Mystery’s distant obscurity, its qi linked to the kidneys—thus called \"ascending to the Upper Mystery.\"\nIt presides over the six bowels and the source of the nine fluids.\nThe nine fluids intertwine, the hundred vessels flow unimpeded; none may be forsaken.\nThe five viscera and six bowels are the fluids of the nine orifices.\nExternally, it corresponds to the two ears and the hundred fluids’ essences.\nThe kidney’s palace governs the ears; when qi wanes, deafness ensues. When yin and yang harmonize, the hundred vessels’ fluids flow freely.\n\nAzure brocade cloud-robes with dancing, coiling dragons—\nAzure brocade mirrors the kidney’s color.\nCloud-robes symbolize the kidney’s membranes.\nCoiling dragons represent the kidney’s vessels.\nThe *Scripture of the Nine Perfected* states: *\"The Dao Lord ever wears robes of azure brocade and skirts of verdant splendor.\"*\nAbove, it summons luminous rosy clouds, sun, and moon’s mist—\nWhen kidney qi flourishes, ears and eyes remain keen and unaging, an external analogy.\nFor a hundred ailments and a thousand calamities, hasten to visualize this.\nMaster Yuanyang says: *\"Cold and heat give rise to one another, male and female complete each other. Within the kidneys dwell two spirits, clad in radiant, resplendent robes—left male bearing the sun, right female bearing the moon. Visualize and behold them, and you shall never know exhaustion.\"*\n\nThe two water-lords face the Gate of Life—\nThe kidneys store a pair, hence \"two departments.\"\nWhen the kidney’s palace rules as water-lord, it transforms into the Red Child, thus called the \"Gate of Life facing birth.\"\nIt enables one to attain long life and ascend the Nine Heavens.\nThe Red Child transforms into a Perfected One, ascending the Nine Heavens—the Nine Heavens being the Azure Heavens of the nine qi, whose qi governs life.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: The Spleen Section**\nThe spleen’s palace belongs to *wu* and *ji*—\nA domain of earth-officials. *Wu* and *ji* govern the central hour.\n\nWithin it dwells a luminous youth clad in yellow robes.\nThe luminous youth refers to the settled *hun*; yellow robes, the color of earth.\nIt disperses the qi of pure grains to secure the teeth—\nFor the spleen serves as the pivot of the five viscera.\nWhen the spleen grinds and digests food, vital qi arrives;\nThe teeth form a lattice of a thousand gates, thus it secures them.\nThis is the Great Granary with its two luminous youths.\nThe Great Granary is the spleen’s mansion.\nThis luminous youth is the spleen’s spirit, named Hun Kang.\nSeated within the ninefold Golden Terrace,\nFocus your mind and visualize the spirit’s form as ever thus.\nA square inch within the Gate of Life—\nThe very center of the Yellow Court, the dwelling of the Cinnabar Field.\nIt governs the harmonizing of the hundred grains and the fragrance of the five flavors,\nThe savors within the mouth, the spleen’s governance of digestion.\nIt wards off emaciation and illness.\nThis refers to inner matters.\nExternally, it corresponds to the radiance of the face,\nThe face being the \"foot-ruler’s abode.\"\nHunger and satiety, emaciation and fullness—all manifest in the complexion.\nThe light and splendor thus generated make it evident,\nRevealing the state of deficiency or repletion.\nClad in yellow brocade and jade robes, girded with a tiger-tally—\nThe spleen governs the central yellow, hence the Yellow Court Perfected One wears brocade.\nThe *Hidden Writ of Jade Petitions* states: \"The Supreme Dao Lord bears the Divine Tiger Jade Tally.\"\nFocus your mind on the Three Elders to soar lightly.\nThe Three Elders refer to the Ageless, the Mysterious Aged, and the Lord.\nMeditate on the Perfected One within the spleen, and transformation occurs naturally.\n\"Child\" refers to one who receives the teachings of the Yellow Court.\nAttain long life, ascend as a lofty immortal, and distance yourself from the calamity of death.\n*Zhuangzi* says: \"Just as life arises, so death arises; just as death arises, so life arises. Just as the permissible arises, so the impermissible arises; just as the impermissible arises, so the permissible arises.\" In this discourse, the principles are equal. Thus, those who attain long life do not die; those who attain quiescence do not live. Neither dying nor living—this is true long life; neither living nor dying—this is true quiescence. How then could the calamity of death reach you?\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: The Gallbladder Section**\nThe gallbladder’s palace is the essence of the six bowels—\nThe six bowels were explained above.\nThe *Scripture of Great Peace* states: \"Accumulated purity becomes essence,\" hence the gallbladder is the essence of the six bowels.\nWithin it dwells a youth whose radiance displays majestic brightness.\nThe scripture states: \"The gallbladder spirit is Dragon Radiance, styled Majestic Brightness,\" signifying courage and vigor.\nThunder and lightning from the eight directions brandish a jade banner—\nThe eight directions’ thunder and lightning signify the gallbladder’s aspect of awe and wrath.\nThe jade banner is the appearance of its qi.\nDragon banners traverse the heavens, hurling fire-bells—\nThe gallbladder’s color is green; dragon banners are instruments of martial might.\nFire-bells resemble the inner pearl beside the gallbladder; when anger arises, they are flung forth.\nIt governs all strength and commands tiger-soldiers—\nThe gallbladder’s power lies in its capacity for fierce resistance, thus it commands tiger-soldiers.\nExternally, it corresponds to the space between the brows and pupils,\nThis refers to inner matters.\nThe heart’s joy and anger manifest at the brows’ ends.\nBrain and hair support each other, both ever resplendent—\nWhen one is enraged, the hair bristles to the crown.\nClad in nine-colored brocade and a green-flowered skirt—\nGreen brocade is the color of the nine qi of the eastern direction.\nThe green-flowered skirt resembles the gallbladder’s membrane.\nAdorned with a golden belt bearing dragon-tiger patterns—\nThe attire of the gallbladder spirit Majestic Brightness.\nBy preserving Majestic Brightness, you ride auspicious clouds—\nAn inner metaphor.\nDiligently meditating on the gallbladder spirit leads to the Dao of immortality.\nIt commands the myriad spirits to pay homage to the Three Origins.\nThe Three Origins Dao Lords reside in the Three Clarities; all heavenly spirits and immortals pay them homage.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: The Spleen’s Vastness**\nThe spleen spans a foot, covering the Great Granary—\nThe Great Granary is the stomach.\nThe *Central Yellow Scripture* states: \"The stomach is the Great Granary.\"\nMaster Yuan Yang says: \"The spleen lies horizontally atop the stomach.\"\nThe Central Elder Lord governs the Hall of Light—\nThe spleen is the palace of the Yellow Court.\nYellow is the color the Elder Lord governs; above, it corresponds to the Hall of Light.\nThe Hall of Light is located an inch within the space between the brows.\nIts name is Ling Yuan, styled Hun Kang—\nThe spleen grinds and digests food, harmonizing inner and outer.\nThe large intestine is the stomach’s child; Hun Yuan Yang receives and contains it, bringing peace and health.\nIt governs the cure of the hundred diseases and the digestion of grains.\nWhen the stomach’s palace flourishes, there is no illness or harm.\nClad in yellow robes with a purple sash and dragon-tiger tally—\nThe spleen resides above the stomach, hence \"yellow robes.\"\nThe purple sash and dragon tally resemble the stomach’s network of vessels.\nIt lengthens essence and extends life, relying on the Lord and King—\nThe Great Granary’s Hun Kang serves as lord and king.\nCall its name thrice, and the spirit communicates of itself—\nMeditate on the spirits of the spleen and stomach, and the heart’s numinous clarity becomes penetrating.\nThe Three Elders sit together, each with their companions—\nThe Upper Elder Lord resides in the Upper Yellow Court Palace, forming a fellowship with the Mud-Pellet Lord, Granary Flower Lord, Azure City Lord, and the lords and ministers of the Hall of Light, the parents of the Cavern Chamber, and the Perfected Ones of the Heavenly Court.\nThe Middle Elder Lord resides in the Middle Yellow Court Palace, forming a fellowship with the Crimson City Youth, Cinnabar Field Lord, Luminous Flower Lord, Containing Brightness Dark Mystery Lord, and Cinnabar Origin Perfected One.\nThe Lower Elder Lord resides in the Lower Yellow Court Palace, forming a fellowship with the Great One Lord, Settled *Hun* Lord, Numinous Origin Lord, Great Granary Lord, and Cinnabar Field Perfected One.\nConstantly preserve the Three Elders to harmonize the hundred spirits,\nCirculating through the bodily regions and nourishing defense, without error.\nSome refine essence, some nurture the embryo, each holding to their method—\nAccording to the *Jade Calendar Scripture*: \"The Lower Cinnabar Field is the root of original life, the repository of spirit and essence, the origin of the five qi. Located three inches below the navel and attached to the spine, it is called the Mansion of the Red Child. In men, it stores essence; in women, it stores the embryo. It governs harmony and union. The Red Child is the gate of yin and yang. Within its Cinnabar Field qi, left is green, right is yellow, above is white, below is black.\"\nThe peach pit harmonizes and extends life’s flowering splendor—\nThe name of the Great One Lord.\nAbiding within, it causes the spirit and qi to flourish.\nFor men and women, the Ninefold Return has Peach Kang—\nThe spirit below the Cinnabar Field is named Peach Kang, governing essence and embryo, able to circulate through the Three Fields and complete the qi of the nine spirits.\nThe Dao Father and Dao Mother face each other in mutual regard—\nYin and yang, two halves forming one, thus they face each other.\n\nThe Master and Mistress dwell in the Cinnabar Mystery Village.\nDao and the Patriarch are the lords of yin and yang.\nThe Cinnabar Mystery Village is the method for preserving the Cinnabar Field.\nOne may employ visualization to ascend the empty void,\nthe Dao of immortal cultivation.\nDivergent paths converge in one essential end.\nUniting the three as one, dispersing the one into three—this is the essence of the Dao.\nThe *Inner Writ of the Mysterious and Wondrous* states: \"If you desire long life, the Three Ones must be made clear.\"\n\nSeal the Three Passes, clench firmly, and pause—\nThe scriptures say: \"The mouth is Heaven’s gate, activating the spirit’s mechanism; the hands are Humanity’s pass, grasping prosperity and decline; the feet are Earth’s barrier, the portal of life.\"\nMoreover, three inches below the navel lies the Pass of Origin, also called the Three Passes, governing the consolidation of essence and protection of qi, preventing reckless dissipation.\n\nHold the golden elixir in the mouth, swallow the jade blossom—\nGolden elixir and jade blossom are the fluids within the mouth.\nThe *Scripture of the Great Cavern* states: \"In the method of ingesting the mysterious root, visualize within the stomach’s opening a maiden, infant-shaped, unclothed, standing upright in the gastric tube. She opens her mouth to receive the infusion of soul-fluid, inhaling the five qi. Rinse and fill the mouth with internal and external fluids, then swallow them, sending them into the mouth of the Mysterious Maiden. After five repetitions, click the teeth five times and swallow the fluid seven times.\"\n\nThus one attains freedom from hunger, and the Three Worms perish.\nThe *Formula of the Cavern Spirit* says: \"The upper worm is white and green, the middle worm white and yellow, the lower worm white and black. When a person dies, the Three Worms emerge as corpse-demons, each transforming into a creature that clings to the form, striking and shattering it.\"\nAll other worms perish with the person.\nTherefore, those who cultivate immortality must first purify themselves, preparing the five pure qi, and only then ingest medicinal substances to expel the Three Worms.\nIt is also said: \"The upper corpse is named Peng Shan, causing one to crave rich flavors and indulge in desires and delusions; the middle corpse is named Peng Zhi, causing one to covet treasures and delight in joy and anger; the lower corpse is Peng Jiao, causing one to love fine clothing and pursue lewdness and lust—these are the Three Worms.\"\n\nWhen the heart and mind are constantly harmonious, joy and prosperity arise—\nThe Dao flows unimpeded.\n\nThe clouds and qi of the Five Peaks swell and flourish—\nThe qi of the five viscera become the clouds of the Five Peaks.\n\"Swelling and flourishing\" denotes free and unobstructed flow.\nPreserve and irrigate the Jade Chamber to replenish oneself—\nThe Jade Chamber is the abode of the nose.\nOnce the Three Worms are expelled, the true qi harmonizes and unites,\nIssuing forth from the Mysterious Female, ceaseless and unbroken—\nThus it is called \"self-replenishment.\"\nThe five forms remain whole and firm, free from calamity—\nThe five bodies and the forms of the five viscera.\nThrough the cultivation of the Dao, the empty chamber generates radiance,\nThe five viscera become firm and complete,\nNaturally free from illness and misfortune,\nWith spirit and qi responding of their own accord.\n\n*The Ten Books on Cultivating Perfection: Commentary on the Inner Radiance of the Jade Scripture, Scroll Fifty-Five* concludes.\n\n*The Ten Books on Cultivating Perfection: Commentary on the Inner Radiance of the Jade Scripture, Scroll Fifty-Six*\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: Gazing Above**\n\nAbove, the Three Origins gleam like linked pearls—\nThe Three Origins refer to the primordial essences of the Three Luminaries: sun, moon, and stars,\nNot the Three Origins of the upper, middle, and lower epochs.\nBrilliant and resplendent, their radiance illumines the nine corners—\nThe Three Luminaries shine from above, casting light upon the nine directions.\nThis speaks of constantly preserving the sun and moon, penetrating and illuminating the entire body.\nThe Five Spirits nightly kindle and illuminate the eight regions—\nThe Five Spirits refer to the five planets.\nWhen their brilliance arrays itself throughout the body and one can constantly preserve them,\nOne attains the same longevity as heaven and earth.\nPreserve the Inner Sovereign and wander with me—\nThe Great Dao is without intent, responding only when moved.\nClad in phoenix robes and bearing tiger tallies—\nThe vestments and regalia of the immortals.\nOnce attained, one swiftly ascends to the realm of Emptiness and Non-Being—\n\"One\" denotes the absence of duality.\nBy transmitting the One in the study of the Dao and uniting with the numinous in body,\nThe attainment of divine transcendence becomes possible.\nAs the *Nanhua True Scripture* states: \"One who can preserve the One brings all matters to completion.\"\n\nWithin the square inch, thoughts are deeply concealed—\nThe square inch refers to the Lower Pass,\nA gate located three inches below the navel, one inch in circumference, for storing essence.\nNeither square nor round, the windows and doors are sealed—\nSquare denotes stillness, round denotes movement;\nNeither moving nor still, one must only block and seal, avoiding reckless dissipation.\nThe Three Spirits return essence, and the aged regain their vigor—\nBy returning essence to the Three Fields, longevity and extended years are achieved.\nThe hun and po guard within, free from contention—\nThe hun is yang, the po is yin, each attaining its unity.\nAs the *Book of Changes* states: \"The Dao of one yin and one yang.\"\nSpirit is born within the abdomen, bearing the Jade Stopper—\nBy guarding within without dissipation, spirit is born bearing the stopper,\nThe abdomen becomes inwardly luminous, the mouth emits pearls and jade.\nAccording to the *Five Spirits’ Conduct Method*: \"Three inches directly above the space between the eyebrows lies the Jade Stopper and Purple Pass.\"\nThe numinous infuses the Dark Gate—how could it be lost?\nWhen spirit is born within the abdomen, the numinous qi flows unimpeded—thus it cannot perish.\nSecure essence at the Gate of the Kidneys—\nThe kidneys govern water, their color is black, and their qi connects to the ears.\nThe \"twin standing gates\" symbolize their towering extremity.\nJade branches, ten thousand fathoms long, can serve as a canopy—\nThe body follows the multitude of spirits, resplendently interlaced,\nLike a ten-thousand-fathom jade tree offering shade—\nAn external metaphor.\n\"Jade branches\" refer to the branches of the jade tree;\n\"Ten thousand fathoms\" denotes vast height, symbolizing the body’s form sheltered by the radiance of the perfected and the numinous.\nThe Three Hun rest in tranquility, and the Emperor’s decree is issued—\nWhen the body’s spirits are at peace, the Emperor’s decree descends.\nOnce the true Dao is accomplished, one’s name is inscribed in the Emperor’s register,\nThus achieving enduring vision.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: The Numinous Terrace**\n\nThe Numinous Terrace is shrouded in mist, gazing toward the Yellow Wilds—\nThe heart is called the Numinous Terrace; the spleen, the Yellow Wilds.\nOne must focus and preserve the vision of the Yellow Court.\nThree inches, distinct chambers, above and below—\nThe Three Elixir Fields—upper, middle, and lower—each distinct,\nEvery chamber one inch in circumference.\nEven today, people refer to the heart as the \"square inch,\" which is its meaning here.\nInquire of the Passes, the Guardians, and the Mysterious Receptacle—\nBetween the Three Fields lie the Passes and Guardians, each with its own division,\nFrom the highest to the lowest, the heart must receive and preserve these with mindfulness.\nThe Grotto Chamber, the Purple Ultimate, the Numinous Gate—\nThe *Great Grotto Scripture* states:\nThree fen between the eyebrows lies the Twin Elixir Fields;\nThree fen into the bone lies the Astral Pass.\nPrecisely seven fen deep,\nTo the left is the Heart Chamber, to the right is the Purple Door.\nOne cun deeper lies the Hall of Brightness,\nTo the left dwells the Bright Lad True Lord, to the right the Bright Maiden True Lord.\nTwo cun deeper lies the Grotto Chamber,\nTo the left dwells the Peerless Lord, to the right the White Prime Lord,\nAt the center dwells the Yellow Elder Lord.\nThree cun deeper lies the Elixir Field Chamber, also called the Muddy Pellet Palace,\nWhere the Upper Prime Red Child resides.\nFour cun deeper lies the Flowing Pearl Palace,\nWhere the Flowing Pearl True Spirit dwells.\nFive cun deeper lies the Jade Emperor’s Palace,\nWhere the Jade Clarity True Mother resides.\nOne cun above the Hall of Brightness lies the Heavenly Court Palace,\nWhere the Upper Clarity True Maiden dwells.\nOne cun above the Grotto Chamber lies the Ultimate Perfection Palace,\nWhere the Supreme Ultimate Empress dwells.\nOne cun above the Elixir Field lies the Mysterious Elixir Palace,\nWhere the Central August Grand Unity True Lord dwells.\nOne cun above the Flowing Pearl lies the Supreme August Palace,\nWhere the Supreme Lord dwells.\nThus, they are called the Numinous Gates.\nThese were once imparted to me by the Supreme—\n\"I\" refers to Lord Fusang, the Great Emperor,\nWho, having accomplished the Dao, received the transmission of the Yellow Court from the Dao Lord in former times.\nThis Dao is not distant—it resides in the Elixir Field—thus it is spoken of as \"once.\"\nThe Divine Lord on the left utters divine speech—\nAccording to the *Great Grotto Scripture*, to the left dwells the Peerless—here called the Divine Lord,\nAn interchangeable term.\n\"Utters divine speech\" means that with focused intent, the spirit instructs one in the Dao.\nTo the right stands the White Prime—\nLeft and right serve as the supports for the cultivator of the Dao.\nBetween the Golden Coffer and the Jade Chamber—\nAll are palaces of the Upper Prime, explained as above.\nThe Upper Clarity Perfected stands before me—\nThe spirits of the Upper Prime all reside at the edge of the Heavenly Court.\nThe Yellow Garment Lad’s cinnabar qi frequently stirs—\nReferring to the youth of the Middle Prime who dwells in the Crimson City.\n\n\"Frequently stirs\" means the qi flourishes without exhaustion.\nI ask: where lies the space between the brows?\nIt is the abode of the Hall of Light.\nWithin, the sun and moon and constellations array themselves—\nThe *Five Celestial Rites of the Sleeves* states: The Supreme Perfected summons the Five Celestial Palaces of the Grotto Chamber, transmitted by the South Pole Primordial Lord.\nEach midnight, sit facing outward and visualize the Western White Star of Venus between the brows, directly entering one inch into the Jade Gate of the Golden Tower, with the sun to the left and the moon to the right.\nNext, visualize the Northern Star of Mercury in the Mysterious Palace of the Emperor’s Realm—the Mysterious Palace lies five fen within the hairline, directly entering one inch.\nThen, visualize the Eastern Star of Jupiter in the Vermilion Terrace of the Grotto Gate—the Vermilion Terrace lies one inch directly behind the eyes.\nNext, visualize the Southern Star of Mars in the Flowery Chamber of the Jade Gate—five fen within the eye’s corner, directly entering five fen.\nFinally, visualize the Central Star of Saturn in the Golden Chamber of the Long Valley—two fen directly within the philtrum.\nVisualize them all as if suspended above, then knock the teeth three times, swallow saliva five times, and softly intone:\n*\"Lofty and purple the celestial towers,\nWithin dwell five spirits,\nTreasure-bright, radiant beams,\nLight surging through the gates.\nEssence and qi swiftly arise,\nTransforming into an elder,\nHead wrapped in white,\nGreen mantle, crimson skirt,\nRight side bearing flowing bells,\nLeft side wearing the tiger tally,\nHand grasping the Celestial Stem,\nScattering radiance, flying stars,\nFeet treading the flowery canopy,\nExhaling rays to refine the body.\nThe Three Luminants guard and preserve,\nGranting me attainment of the True,\nNurturing the hun, restraining the po,\nRiding the whirlwind to ascend as an immortal.\"*\nThis practice is the inner visualization method.\n\nSeven luminaries and nine origins crown the Gate of Life.\nThe seven luminaries are the seven stars, corresponding to the seven apertures of the human body.\nThe nine origins are the nine celestial bodies, corresponding to the nine apertures.\nNone may be neglected, hence they are said to crown the Gate of Life.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: The Three Passes**\nWithin the Three Passes, essence and qi run deep—\nReferring to the Pass of Origin, where men store their essence.\nAlternatively, as stated below, the mouth, hands, and feet are the Three Passes.\nOr, as Master Yuanyang holds, the Hall of Light, Grotto Chamber, and Elixir Field are the Three Passes.\nAll may be taken according to the text’s meaning and preserved in practice.\nWithin the Nine Subtleties, it is dark and yin—\nThe *Great Grotto Scripture* states: The Three Primes conceal transformations to form the Three Palaces, named Great Clarity, Great Simplicity, and Great Harmony. Three times three makes nine, hence there are three Elixir Fields and three Grotto Chambers, combining with the Three Primes to form Nine Palaces. Each palace holds subtle essence, thus called the Nine Subtleties, meaning they are profound and unseen.\nThe mouth is the Heavenly Pass, the mechanism of spirit—\nIt expresses emotions like the pivot of a trigger.\nThe hands are the Human Pass, grasping prosperity or decline—\nWhether to release or seize lies within oneself.\nThe feet are the Earthly Pass, the gateway of life—\nThey govern the movement of one’s body and thus one’s vitality.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: If Attained**\nIf one attains the Three Palaces and preserves the Mysterious Elixir—\nThe Three Palaces are the three Elixir Fields.\nThe Mysterious Elixir is the primordial cinnabar.\nVisualization resides in the heart, hence it specifically refers to one locus.\nThe flowing pearl of the Great One rests upon Kunlun—\nThe flowing pearl of the Great One refers to the pupils of the eyes.\nThe *Scripture of Grotto Spirits* states: The head is the Three Terraces, the ruler is Kunlun, referring to the Upper Elixir Field.\nIt also says: The navel is the Lord of the Great One, also called Kunlun, referring to the Upper Elixir Field.\nIt speaks of visualizing the Three Elixir Fields, where the spirit shines clearly before one’s eyes.\nThe *Root Scripture* states: If you wish not to die, cultivate Kunlun.\nLayer upon layer, the twelve-storied towers coil—\nReferring to the twelve rings of the throat, stacked above the heart.\nThe heart is the Crimson Palace, resembling a towered pavilion.\nFrom high to low, all are Perfected Ones—\nThe three fields and twelve towers all house Perfected Ones,\nas explained above.\nThe Jade Hall and Crimson Palace are all Mysterious Palaces—\nThe Crimson Palace and Hall of Light correspond above and below, all being chambers.\nThe jade pivot and balance beam gleam like orchid and jade—\nThe throat bones form a circular, rotating structure.\nOrchid and jade share a single hue.\nI gaze upon the youth who sits in tranquil repose—\nVisualizing the Cinnabar Perfected Youth of the Crimson City.\n\"Sits\" denotes the spirit’s serenity.\nI ask: whose child dwells within my body?\nIt is to say: he is one’s own.\n\nWhere has this person gone but into the Mud-Pill Palace?\nIn harmony with the Upper Prime’s host of spirits, above and below in accord.\nThe scripture states: the brain is the Mud-Pill Palace.\nBy thousands and hundreds they link themselves—\nThe spirit originally emerges from the One,\nthe One generates the Two,\nthe Two generates the Three,\nthe Three generates the myriad things,\nall transformations never depart from body and heart.\nTwenty upon twenty like layered mountains—\nVisualizing the myriad things seated in layered repose.\nMountains resemble the form of sitting.\n\nCloud-ornaments and jade blossoms flank the ear-gate—\nCloud-ornaments and jade blossoms are names for the temples’ hair,\nfor the ears reside between them.\nThe *Great Cavern Scripture* says: the spirit of the hair is named Azure Blossom.\nWhenever it speaks of “blossom,” it is like the blossom of grasses and trees.\n\nThe Crimson Thearch and Yellow Elder accompany my hun-soul—\nThe Crimson Thearch is the Lord of the Southern Quarter.\nThe Yellow Elder Lord is the Lord of the Central Quarter.\nThe hun is the yang spirit, the po the yin spirit;\nyin and yang respond to each other, thus it speaks of accompanying the hun.\nThe *Luminous Writ of the Grand Tenuity* states:\nhumans possess three hun-souls—\nthe first is Fetal Radiance,\nthe second is Luminous Effulgence,\nthe third is Dark Essence.\nConstantly invoking their names ensures the three hun-souls never leave the body.\n\nThree Perfected Ones support the axle, sharing the ford and qi—\nThe hun, the Crimson Thearch, and the Yellow Elder are the Three Perfected Ones,\nsaid to respond in mutual support, sharing the ford and qi.\nThe Five Ladles gleam bright as the Seven Primes—\nThe Five Ladles are the Five Stars of the Northern Dipper.\nThe *Ordinance of the Cavern Chamber* says:\nto visualize the Seven Prime Celestials,\nwhether upon rising, at the first outing, or after meals,\nrecite the incantation:\n“The Five Stars open the way,\nthe Six Harmonies are the Purple Chamber.\nReturn to the Hidden Dao,\nthe Seven Celestials shine resplendent.\nThe begetter of the hun-soul is the Dark Father,\ntransforming the One to become spirit.\nThe begetter of the po-soul is the Dark Mother,\ntransforming the Two to become the body.\nThe Master of my sinews and bones is the Noble Son,\nthe White Prime governs my essence and qi.\nLong life and enduring vision,\nascend as an immortal to the Ten Heavens.”\n\nThe sun and moon fly coursing through the Six Harmonies—\nWithin Heaven and Earth is the Six Harmonies;\nvisualize the sun, moon, stars, and constellations within the body,\nthe myriad images all as clear as within a single day.\nThe Emperor’s homeland at the center of Heaven, the Earth’s gate at its end—\nFive fen above the brows, one cun straight in is the Emperor’s homeland.\nMoreover, one cun above the Hall of Light is the Heavenly Court,\nthat is, the center of Heaven.\nMoreover, the nose is the Earth’s gate of the upper region.\nVisualizing the sun, moon, stars, and other spirits,\nthey always reside at its end—\nthat is, above the nose and below the hairline.\n\nThe facial hun-spirits and gods all abide in mutual presence—\nThe inner and outer heart-spirits and eyes respond to each other.\n\n**Breathing Chapter the Twentieth**\n\nInhaling and exhaling primordial qi to seek immortality—\nProbing the flying root and mysterious radiance,\nswallowing the Five Sprouts and embracing the Nine Clouds,\nthe method of fetal breathing,\nreferring to the qi of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, the four seasons, and the Five Phases.\nThe Immortal Duke and Noble Son seem to stand before one—\nThis is the *Ordinance of the Cavern Chamber*.\nThe left of the Cavern Chamber is the Peerless Flower, also named the Noble Son.\nThe Immortal Duke directly indicates the Yellow Court.\nIf the Yellow Court’s Immortal Duke can practice the Cavern Chamber’s ordinance\nand visualize its Noble Son, thus they are said to stand before one.\n\nThe Vermilion Crow retracts and extends from the White Stone Source—\nThe Vermilion Crow is the image of the tongue.\nThe White Stone is the image of the teeth.\nRetracting and extending guide the fluid essence,\nregulating the qi of yin and yang,\nflowing without cease—thus it is called the Source.\n\nCongealing essence and nurturing the embryo to transform and generate the body—\nThe origin from which one’s self has come.\nPreserving the embryo and halting essence can grant long life—\nThe *True Sayings* state:\nthe oral instructions of the Upper Clarity Perfected Ones—\nthose who study the Dao should pacify the heart and nurture the spirit,\ningesting and refining to cure illness,\nensuring the Mud-Pill Palace is filled and the mysterious essence does not spill,\nonly then can one preserve form and spirit,\ningesting cloud-souls and exhaling-inhaling the Two Luminaries.\nIf one frequently engages in intercourse and leaks essence,\nthe practitioner’s qi becomes foul, the spirit perishes,\nessence and numen wither and deplete.\nEven if one wears the Dark Stem and bears the Jade Register,\nthe Golden Writ of the Great Ultimate,\nhow can one resolve this to attain life?\nIn former times, my late teacher often cautioned against this matter, saying:\nfor those who study,\none act of intercourse spills the efficacy of one year’s medicinal practice,\ntwo acts spill two years’ efficacy.\nBeyond this, the unspilled medicine entirely vanishes from the body.\nThus, the true immortals are ever vigilant in this regard,\nfor it is the great taboo of life’s generation.\n\nThe Three Qi revolve to the right, the Nine Paths grow bright—\nThe Three Qi are the qi of the Three Cinnabar Fields.\n“Revolve to the right” means circulating in orderly sequence,\nharmonizing yin and yang so the Four Passes and Nine Orifices flow freely,\nluminous and free of illness.\nUprightness and unity with the blossom bring fullness—\nEmbracing uprightness and guarding the One,\nthe spirit and qi flourish in blossom,\nthus one can fill the Six Harmonies,\nriding things and transforming them.\nGazing afar, the heart is like a net’s star—\nVisualizing the Cinnabar Perfected Youth dwelling within the Crimson City,\nlike a star shining in the net’s valley.\nBeneath the Golden Chamber it cannot topple—\nThe heart resides below the lungs,\ngoverning metal, its color white—\nthus the Golden Chamber should always be visualized,\ngranting long life without death.\nExtending my white-haired years to return to infancy—\nAn internal matter.\nIt refers to an ageless childlike countenance.\n\n**Jade Chamber Chapter the Twenty-First**\n\nWithin the Jade Chamber, enter the plain assembly—\nReferring to the Upper Prime’s pure and true.\nThe Jade Chamber is the image of the body’s bones.\nThe Mud-Pill Lady stands at its center—\nThe scripture states: within the Cavern Chamber are father and mother;\nthe mother is the Lady, also named the Dao-Mother.\nThe Mud-Pill and Cavern Chamber have already been explained above.\n\nThe Long Valley and Dark Homeland encircle the outer suburbs—\nThe Long Valley is the nose.\nThe Dark Homeland is the kidneys.\nThe outer suburbs are the Five Viscera and Six Bowels.\nIt speaks of the nose’s qi issuing and entering below,\ndriving the kidneys’ movement,\ncirculating through the viscera and bowels,\ndwelling in the Crimson City.\nVisualizing the inner city walls and outer suburbs—\nthus it serves as a metaphor.\n\nThe Six Dragons scatter and fly, difficult to distinguish—\nIt speaks of the qi of the Six Bowels,\nsubtle and mysteriously communicative,\ndifficult to distinguish—\nyet one visualizes and preserves them.\n\nLong life demands utmost caution in the chamber’s urgency—\nQi lost and fluids leaked,\nmarrow withered and essence exhausted.\nThough one gains a trickle,\nit leaks through the tail’s gate—\none cannot but be cautious.\nWhy act in death’s service, making the spirits weep?\nImprudence in the chamber harms essence and loses clarity,\nthus the spirits weep.\n\nSwift neglect invites calamity in the realm of ruin—\nthe realm of ruin is the land of death.\nThe Three Spirits—three hun souls—\nare called Fetal Radiance, Luminous Clarity, and Mystic Essence,\nnow lost and submerged.\nOne must only inhale qi and gather the essence of the child.\nThrough breath regulation and restraint,\nclose the chamber and halt the leakage of essence.\n\nThe inch-field and foot-dwelling may govern life—\nthis speaks of the three cinnabar fields’ dwellings,\neach a square inch in measure, hence called inch-fields.\nOne relies on the method of preserving the cinnabar fields to cultivate life.\nThe scripture states: “Inch-field, foot-dwelling”—\nthat foot-dwelling refers to the face.\nIf one indulges in the central sea with a hundred draughts—\nthis speaks of chamber excess and indiscriminate leakage,\nheedless of restraint.\nLeaves fall, the tree withers, losing its verdant hue—\na metaphor for the lifeless, breathless state.\nQi lost and fluids leaked are no longer one’s own form.\nThe immortal scriptures say: “Close the chamber to refine fluids,\nrefrain from spitting, and limit speech.”\n\nFocused closure and mastery of the radiant scene bring enduring peace—\nconcentrate on restraining desire,\nvisualizing the light of sun and moon.\nLaozi says: “One skilled in closure needs no bolt nor bar,\nyet none can open it.”\nThe *Upper Clarity Plain Text Spirit Writ* contains the method of “probing the root of qi”:\nAt sunrise, face east and click the teeth nine times,\nthen silently recite the incantation:\n*“Sun’s soul, pearl radiance,\nilluminating the green canopy,\ncrimson youth of returning mist,\nmysterious flame and whirling image.”*\nAfter reciting these sixteen characters,\nclose the eyes, clench the fists,\nand visualize five-colored streaming mists enveloping the body—\nthus the sunlight and flowing mists enter the mouth together,\ncalled “Flying Blossom Jade Womb,” the water’s mother.\nEach day, swallow the mist forty-five times,\nand nine times swallow the saliva.\n\nPreserve my Mud-Pill Palace’s Three Wondrous Spirits—\nthe Mud-Pill Palace is the upper cinnabar field.\nThe *Great Cavern Scripture* states:\n“When the Three Lights conceal their transformations,\nthey become the Three Offices:\nfirst, the Three Lords within the Grand Clarity;\nsecond, the spirits of the three cinnabar fields;\nthird, the spirits of the talismanic registers—\nhence called the Three Wondrous Spirits.”\n\nSerene and detached, inward vision brings clarity—\nthis speaks of the method of visualizing the cinnabar fields,\nas described above.\nWhat thing would disturb one’s tranquility and peace?\nWalking the Dao with true integrity,\nno demonic force can intrude.\nProsperous indeed, yet no longer serving age only to return to youth—\nfierce beasts do not crouch,\nhunting birds do not strike,\nthe old regain vigor,\nthe young grow strong—\nabundant and flourishing.\nMeditating on the jade scriptures, one enters the Upper Clarity.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: Constant Reflection**\nEver mindful, the three chambers interconnect...\n\nThe three chambers refer to the Hall of Light, the Grotto Chamber, and the Cinnabar Field. They interconnect with the Flowing Pearl, the Five Thearchs, the Celestial Court, the Ultimate Truth, the Mysterious Cinnabar, the Mud-Pill Palace, the Grand August, and all other palaces—left and right, above and below—forming a seamless whole. With penetrating vision, one sees without distinction of inner or outer. By visualizing three threes as nine, uniting nine into one, clarity pervades the heavens, dissolving all boundaries of within and without.\n\nTo ingest the Five Sprouts and banish hunger and thirst—\nThe *Lingbao Scriptures* prescribe the method of consuming the Five Sprouts. The Five Sprouts are the generative *qi* of the Five Phases, corresponding to the primordial essence of the five viscera. As the scripture states: On the day of the Beginning of Spring, at cock’s crow, enter the chamber, face east, and bow nine times. Sit upright, click the teeth nine times, and visualize the Nine Worthies of the Eastern Quarter—Anbao, Hualin, Qingling, and the Nine Thousand Lords of the Primordial Elder—descending into the chamber in a dense cloud. Their forms enter through the mouth and descend directly into the liver palace. Recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Ninefold *qi* of the Azure Heavens,\nPrimordial essence of the Supreme Origin,\nVenerable Lords of the August Elder,\nClad in feathered azure,\nPresiding over the Celestial Offices,\nRadiant as Jupiter’s splendor,\nScattering brilliance and flowing fragrance,\nThey bathe my form.\nI ingest the morning auroras,\nI drink the essence of wood,\nNurturing the Azure Sprout,\nGuarding it with care.\nThe liver palace overflows,\nThe royal mushroom flourishes,\nProlonging years and refining complexion,\nRestoring the countenance of infancy.\nThe Five *qi* merge as one,\nHeaven and Earth endure in union.\"*\n\nAfterward, draw in the azure *qi* nine times and swallow, then ingest the twelve vermilion-script jade characters of the Eastern Quarter.\n\nThe Divine Splendor holds the towel as the Six Dings pay homage.\nThe Divine Splendor, as the *Jade Calendar Scripture* states, is the Five Maidens of the Mysterious Radiance of the Grand Yin, mothers of the Dao. Clad in five-colored crimson robes, they reside above the spleen palace, beneath the canopy of yellow clouds. The Six Dings are the six yin spirits of the jade maidens. The *Laozi’s Six Jia Talismanic Charts* state: Each Ding has its own spirit. The Ding-mao spirit is the Jade Maiden Sima Duyu, who governs the lunar months. The Ding-chou spirit is the Jade Maiden Zhao Ziwang, who harmonizes *qi*. The Ding-hai spirit is the Jade Maiden Zhang Wentong, who purifies all. The Ding-you spirit is the Jade Maiden Jiang Wengong, who brings joy. The Ding-wei spirit is the Jade Maiden Shi Shutong, who guards against harm. The Ding-si spirit is the Jade Maiden Cui Juqing, who hears the heart’s intent. To ingest the Flying Root is to practice the method of rinsing the Yellow Sprout; upon mastery, one commands the Six Ding spirits.\n\nGuard the chamber of essence and do not recklessly discharge it.\nThe chamber of essence refers to the three cinnabar fields, interconnected and unbroken. Its regulation lies in the heart, which is the middle cinnabar field—the source of urgency and ease, the root of truth and delusion. Sealed and preserved, it ensures longevity. This is the result of accumulating essence.\n\nArising from within the form, never apart—\nThis speaks of the heart directing *qi*, subtle and formless.\n\nThe three palaces lie near, easily concealed and gathered.\nThe three cinnabar fields’ true lords reside within the body. Concealing and gathering essence, the heart must serve as their sovereign.\n\nVoid and still, the plainness within emptiness—\nThis refers to external affairs. \"Plainness\" has two interpretations: First, the body should be as light and serene as silk suspended in the void. Second, the body’s inner emptiness should be as weightless as a vessel. Plainness is the natural state of tranquility; \"defilement\" refers to external distractions.\n\nThe nine chambers stand upright and empty, abodes of the numinous.\nThe nine chambers are the nine palaces within the head and the nine orifices of the body. When the upper palaces flourish and the nine orifices are aligned, they become the dwelling places of all spirits. The *Cavern Spirit Scripture* states: Heaven has nine stars, hence the Nine Heavens. Earth has nine palaces, hence the Nine Lands. Humans have nine orifices, hence the Nine Lives—referring to the origins of human existence.\n\nVisualize the hundred thoughts and observe the rhythm.\nVisualize the hundred spirits within the body, their breath rising and falling in accordance with the prescribed method. It is also said: \"Thousands upon thousands, hundreds upon hundreds, like layered mountains\"—all are divine images.\n\nCultivate the six palaces and do not let them decay.\nAccording to the *Cavern Spirit Scripture*, the six palaces are: the lungs as the Jade Hall Palace, the Office of the Chief Minister; the heart as the Crimson Palace, the Primordial Yang Office; the liver as the Clear and Cold Palace, the Orchid Terrace Office; the gallbladder as the Purple Tenuity Palace, the Boundless Office; the kidneys as the Pastoral Palace, the Supreme Harmony Office; and the spleen as the Central Yellow Palace, the Grand Simplicity Office. These differ from the ordinary six viscera.\n\nThen, soaring freely, one enters the cloud paths.\n\nThe cultivation of ascending as an immortal and transforming the physical form.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three: Nurturing Life**\n\nThe Dao of nurturing life is not burdensome,\nEmbracing non-action, purity, and simplicity,\nRestraining oneself and upholding rectitude.\nSimply cultivate the *Dongxuan* and the *Jade Canon*.\n*Dongxuan* refers to the *Dongxuan Lingbao*;\nThe *Jade Canon’s* true script is the *Huangting*.\n\nAdditionally, activate the Eight Radiant Spirits within the body.\nThe *Jade Canon Scripture* states: The five viscera correspond to the eight trigrams, where celestial spirits guard and the Great One’s envoys—eight nodes forming nine palaces—reside. Beyond the eight trigrams lie the Twelve Towers, which are the throat’s passages. The navel is the Lord of the Great One, master of life. It is also called Taiyuan, Kunlun, and Taiji, governing the thirteen thousand luminous essences within the body. The Twenty-Four Perfected emerge naturally. Heaven possesses twenty-four true qi, and the human body mirrors this. Moreover, the three cinnabar fields each contain three times eight, totaling twenty-four Perfected Ones, all born of the Dao’s natural qi.\n\nWith lofty composure and non-action, the hun and po are at peace,\nMoving without awareness, sitting in oblivion,\nDetaching from form and relinquishing intellect.\nIn clarity and stillness, the spirit manifests and speaks to me.\nThrough purity and tranquility, the heart’s spirit reveals itself, its perception boundless. When it speaks to oneself, it is the Perfected One of the Yellow Court. Where does it reside? In the purple chamber’s veiled toad’s abode—\nThe purple chamber’s canopy, also called the Crimson Palace, is the dwelling of the Red City’s youth. Visualizing the heart’s spirit takes this form. Standing or sitting, beyond the chamber lie the three and five mysteries.\nThe Eight Radiant Spirits and the Twenty-Four Perfected Ones guard and nourish the body, harmonizing the three fields and five viscera’s true qi, warding off all afflictions. Burning incense and clasping hands before the Jade Flower—\nThe Jade Flower is before the canopy, referring to the space between the brows, the Heavenly Court. It is the ancestral origin of spirits and the cavernous abode of the Perfected. One must visualize it according to the text. Together, we enter the Great Chamber and wander the Gate of the Celestial Pivot.\nAccording to the *Cavern Chamber Scripture*: Heaven possesses the Great Chamber, Jade Chamber, and Cloud Court. The Cloud Court is where the Central Yellow Elder Lord resides. The Jade Chamber is also called the Purple Chamber or Crimson Palace, collectively known as the Yellow Hall. The Flower Canopy spans the eastern and western chambers, connecting to the left and right Yellow Courts within. The human body mirrors this, as described above. The Celestial Pivot is the central axis. Delving deeply into tranquility, the Dao’s perfection—\nRefining essence in serenity, true qi roams freely.\nInward vision and subtle gaze reveal all truths.\nIn stillness and contemplation, the hundred spirits stand in array. The Perfected One resides within—do not seek neighbors.\nThe *Jade Terrace Scripture* states: Laozi is the celestial hun, the Lord of Nature, ever attending the Dao Lord at his side. The human body contains this as well. Where else would one seek the cause of the Dao?\nThe scripture says: The Great Dao flows everywhere, left and right. It is not distant.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four: Concealing Radiance**\n\nConcealing radiance and hiding form, set apart from the world,\nThe adept of immortality conceals brilliance and veils splendor, erasing traces and obscuring origins. Nurturing qi and fostering essence, the mouth like cinnabar—\nSkin as ice and snow, graceful as a maiden.\nGrasping life’s nature and guarding emptiness,\nIn quiescence, stillness, and non-action.\nOne’s name enters the Upper Clarity’s register of the dead, expunged.\nAttaining the rank of Perfected One, one’s name is inscribed in the mysterious ledger. The joy of the Three Spirits arises from reclusion—\nGoverning the body through non-action brings spiritual delight; governing the state without affairs brings peace to the people. The Three Spirits are the spirits of the three cinnabar fields. Swiftly soaring and roaming without lingering cares—\nSwift and sudden, as in the phrase: \"Driving swiftly to welcome life at Eastern Meng.\" Alternatively: \"Swiftly riding the dragon, free from lingering cares,\" signifying liberation. Donning feathered robes, the Eight Winds propel one forward—\nThe Eight Winds are the winds of the eight directions.\n\nSwiftly clearing the path ahead—\nFeathered robes are the garb of immortals. According to the *Precious Writ of the Upper Clarity*, immortals wear five-colored feathered robes; the Perfected One of the Great Unity dons nine-hued cloud-soaring feathered vestments—all divine raiment of the transcendent, hence the name.\n\nGuiding the reins of the Three Simplicities, riding the morning mist—\nOutwardly pointing to matters. The Three Clouds and Nine Mists are the domains of the immortals.\n\nDoes the golden chariot ascend in proper rank, following the jade procession?\nThe *Scripture of the Primordial Register* states: The Eight Sages of the Mysterious Spirits of the Nine Heavens of the Upper Clarity harness nine phoenix-drawn dragon carriages. The Jade Procession of the Nine Heavens and the golden brush are all implements and attire of the immortals.\n\nWhy not ascend the mountain and recite my scripture?\nThe scripture refers to the *Huangting* text.\n\nLush and profound, the abode of the Perfected Ones—\nThe mountains’ depths are secluded.\nWhy hesitate to enter? Yet one lingers,\nFor the heart’s resolve is not aligned.\nThe world below teems with clamor, foul as a rotting stench—\nSwiftly despise the polluted world of men, unworthy of longing.\n*Foul* denotes the utmost stench.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: The Five Phases**\nThe Five Phases revolve and return to the One...\n\nThe Five Phases are Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. Their mutual generation proceeds thus: Metal engenders Water, Water engenders Wood, Wood engenders Fire, Fire engenders Earth, Earth engenders Metal, cycling endlessly. Their mutual restraint follows this pattern: Fire restrains Metal, Metal restrains Wood, Wood restrains Earth, Earth restrains Water, Water restrains Fire, likewise cycling without cease. This mutual generation is the Dao.\n\nReturning to the One—One is the number of Water, the root of the Five Phases’ Dao and the origin of the myriad things. As Laozi says: “The Dao gives birth to the One, the One gives birth to the Two, the Two gives birth to the Three, and the Three give birth to the myriad things.” The *Book of Changes* likewise states: “The Supreme Polarity gives rise to the Two Modes.” The Supreme Polarity is the One; the Two Modes are Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth give birth to the myriad things, and the myriad things in turn return to the One. The One is the designation of Non-Being, from which all things are accomplished—hence it is called “returning to the One.”\n\nThe Three and Five unite their qi in the nine-by-nine nodes. The *Scripture of Wondrous Perfection* states: “The Three are: in Heaven, the sun, moon, and stars; on Earth, pearls, jade, and gold—these are called the Three Treasures. In the human body, they are the ears, mouth, and nose—termed the Three Vitalities.” Heaven, Earth, and Humanity are the Three Powers, each containing them. The Five are the essence of the Sovereign; thus it is said “Three-Five unite.” Three times three makes nine.\n\nThe Three and Five that are contained regulate all categories, harmonize the myriad things, govern the transformation of yin and yang, cover and support Heaven and Earth, illuminate the Four Seas, and generate wind, rain, thunder, and lightning, the four seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, the alternations of cold, heat, warmth, and coolness, and the qi of purity and turbidity. None of the living things can arise without the union of Three and Five. Thus it is said: “The Dao of Heaven is not distant; the Three and Five return again.”\n\nThe Three and Five are the repository of Heaven and Earth, the essential convergence of the Six Directions, and the qi-nodes of the Nine Palaces. Nine times nine makes eighty-one, which forms a single chapter. One may employ the Eight Concealments to revolve through the Eight Guards. Within the Nine Palaces lie the arts of concealment and transformation—this is the *Hidden Writ of the Eight Qi Rushing to the Celestial Court*, called the Eight Evolutions. There are also the Eight Evolutions of the Supreme Polarity. Within the Supreme Polarity are the Three Lords: the first is the Supreme August Lord, the second is the Heavenly August Lord, and the third is the Yellow Elder Lord. The qi of the Three Origins and the essence of primordial chaos enter and exit the Palace of Grand Clarity in the Supreme Void, concealed and formless—thus is the Dao of long life attained.\n\nThe Crouching Ox guards the Dark Gate in ranked array. The Crouching Ox is an image of the kidneys; the kidneys are the Dark Gate. The *Central Yellow Scripture* states: “The left kidney is the Mysterious Wondrous Perfected One; the right kidney is the Mysterious Origin Lord.” When their ranks and positions are visualized, they become visible.\n\nThe Three Luminaries emerge at the boundary of life and death. Heaven’s Three Luminaries are the sun, moon, and stars; Earth’s Three Luminaries are the patterns of literature and brilliance; Humanity’s Three Luminaries are the ears, nose, and mouth—these mark the boundary of life and death.\n\nThe Cavern Chamber’s numinous image rivals the sun and moon. Visualize the Three Origins within the Cavern Chamber. The Cavern Chamber and Bright Hall have been explained above.\n\nThe father is the Muddy Pellet; the mother, the Feminine One. Within the Bright Hall are ruler and ministers; within the Cavern Chamber, husband and wife; within the Cinnabar Field, father and mother. The Muddy Pellet is the name of the brain spirit. The *Laozi* states: “Know the masculine, but keep to the feminine.” The Feminine is Non-Action—this is the One.\n\nThe Three Lights radiantly illumine the Chamber of the Child. Clarity extends in all four directions.\n\nIf one can preserve the Mysterious Perfected, all affairs are complete. As Zhuangzi says: “If one can guard the One, all affairs are complete.”\n\nThe spirit and essence of the body must not be lost. Constantly maintain this awareness, not neglecting it even for a moment.\n\n*Annotations to the Jade Scripture of the Yellow Court’s Inner Radiance from the Fifty-Sixth Scroll of the Ten Books on Cultivating Perfection* concludes.\n\n*Annotations to the Jade Scripture of the Yellow Court’s Inner Radiance from the Fifty-Seventh Scroll of the Ten Books on Cultivating Perfection*\n*Commentary by Liangqiouzi*\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: Soaring Aloft**\n\nSoaring aloft with the sun and moon, I ascend the Dao—\nI am the Lord of the Dao.\n\nThe *Purple Texts of Supreme Clarity’s* method of absorbing the qi of the sun and moon is also called *The Scripture of Cinnabar Gold Essence, Stone Radiance, and the Jade Womb of the Water Mother*. Its practice is as follows: at sunrise, face east and click the teeth nine times. Silently invoke the names of the Five Emperors within the sun’s soul, reciting:\n*“Sun-soul, Vermilion Radiance,\nIllumining the Green Sheath,\nCrimson Lads of the Returning Clouds,\nMysterious Flames Displaying the Image.”*\nAfter reciting these sixteen characters, close the eyes, clench the fists, and visualize the five-colored streaming clouds entering the mouth.\n\nFurthermore, the *Divine Writ of Supreme Clarity* contains the method of absorbing the essence of the moon: at moonrise, face west and click the teeth ten times. Silently invoke the names of the Five Hun and Five Ladies within the moon, reciting:\n*“Moon-spirit, Vast and Serene,\nFragrant and Lustrous, Veiled in Void,\nGraceful and Empty, Numinous Orchid,\nLush Blossoms Forming Petals,\nPure Gold Essence Gleaming,\nVast Countenance, Terrace’s Mark.”*\nAfter reciting these twenty-four characters, clench the fists, close the eyes, and visualize the five-colored essence-light of the moon entering the mouth. Moreover, the yellow qi within the moonlight is the essence of the Jade Womb’s moon-flower. Those who cultivate this Dao will soar into the sun and moon as immortals.\n\nYuyi and Jielin, the paired guardians—\nYuyi is the immortal who soars with the sun; Jielin, the immortal who soars with the moon. Like sounds resonate, like qi seeks its kind; thus do these two immortals come to safeguard one another.\n\nThen one beholds the Ageless One of Jade Clarity’s Void,\nAscending above the Three Clarities to merge with the Dao.\n\nThis can reverse aging, replenish the brain and blood,\nAs the hun and po return to infancy, attaining the perfection of the True Person.\n\nMouth holding the magic mushroom, bearing the Five Stars,\nExhaling five-colored numinous qi, the radiant mushroom illumining the four directions, roaming the Six Directions with the Five Yellow Lords.\n\nWaist girded with the Tiger Register, adorned with golden pendants—\nSuch is the raiment of the immortals. The *Scripture of the Nine Perfected* states: “The Yellow Lord of the Central Palace wears at his waist the talisman of the Dark Dragon and Divine Tiger, bears the chiming bells of flowing gold, and wields the purple banner’s staff.” The *Register* is the talisman.\n\nRiding the carriage to welcome life, feasting in the Eastern Mists.\n\nSwift as the wind’s sudden gust, one departs—\nThus \"welcoming life\" in the eastern mists.\n\nThe mountains of the Eastern Sea’s immortal realm,\nThe land where life is received, ever conjoined with vital qi,\nAre where one roams in serene delight.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven of the Mysterious Origin**\n\nThe One refines the hun and po above,\nThe Treasure refines the spirit,\nThe spirit refines to merge with the One.\nThe One, as a thing, is scarcely glimpsed—\nThe One is nameless.\nThe heart, tranquil and detached, attains it,\nYet it remains unseen.\nOnly when utmost truth is reached does it deign to glance back.\n\nGuard the true, fill the will,\nAnd the One returns of itself.\nMost abhorred are the dead qi and all foul impurities.\nIn flying elixirs, refining medicines, absorbing qi, or swallowing mist,\nOne must shun the sight of corpses, concealed filth—\nThese are the shared perils of the living realm.\n\nYet the Dao is empty and void,\nOriginally beyond purity or impurity.\nWhen the household attains true correctness,\nPurity and impurity diverge.\nDivergent and unequal,\nRight and wrong arise within,\nLife and death manifest without.\nThus, the pure are the companions of life,\nThe turbid and foul, the companions of death—\nHence their avoidance in nurturing life.\n\nThe Six Spirits gather in the void’s feast.\nThe Six Jia, Six Ding, and spirits of the Six Palaces,\nAll dwelling within the body,\nFind tranquil repose in emptiness.\n\nBind the pearls to secure essence and nourish the root of spirit.\n\"Binding the pearls\" means swallowing saliva in sequence, like linked pearls.\n\"Securing essence\" means not wasting it wantonly.\nThe \"root of spirit\" is the physical form.\nThe spirit’s relation to the body\nIs as a lord to a state, a ruler to the people.\nThe people take the ruler as their life,\nThe ruler takes the people as their foundation.\nMutually sustaining, they nurture and harmonize life.\n\nThe jade bar and golden key remain ever whole.\nLaozi said: \"One who excels in closure needs no bolt, yet none can open it.\"\nThe *key* is the lock; *ba* may be read as *shi* (key).\nClose the mouth, curl the tongue to drink the fetal fluid—\nCurl the tongue to circulate the fluid, consume the fluid to become a fetal immortal,\nHence called \"fetal fluid.\"\nThus I refine and attain flight as an immortal,\nThrough the devotion and sincerity of my practice.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight: The Immortal**\n\nThe immortal and Daoist are not inherently divine—\nThey cultivate study to accumulate essence,\nRefine qi to embody the true.\nEssence accumulates, qi gathers to form the true.\nSecure essence, guard qi, refine through accumulation to attain the true,\nCultivate study to achieve it.\n\nThe wondrous voice of the Yellow Youth is rarely heard—\nThe *Yellow Youth* refers to the Perfected of the Yellow Court,\nAlso called the *Crimson Walled Youth*.\nThe *wondrous voice* is the sublime teaching of the Yellow Court’s Dao.\n\nThe *Jade Writ* bears vermilion script on crimson bamboo slips—\nThe *August Court Classic*, also named *The Celestial Sovereign’s Golden Writ*,\nOr *The Jade Chapters of the Gathered Flowers*.\nIts characters proclaim: \"The Perfected wears a golden kerchief\"—\nThe *Perfected* is the Yellow Youth.\nGold is white, dwelling in the West, governing the lungs;\nIts white hue resides in the heart, hence called a *kerchief*.\nThe *Nine Perfections Classic* states:\n\"The Azure Emperor of the East wears a robe of azure jade,\nAdorned with a skirt of verdant splendor,\nBearing the vermilion talisman of the sacred fungus,\nAnd a golden kerchief as his crown.\"\n\nMaster Primal Yang said:\n\"The Perfected sits facing south, legs crossed,\nFeet aligned with the east and west.\"\n\nThe west (酉) is metal. Bearing armor and holding talismans, it opens the seven gates. The *Laozi’s Six Jia and Three Divisions Talismans* states: \"The spirit of Jiazi is named Wang Wenqing; the spirit of Jiaxu is named Zhan Zijiang; the spirit of Jiashen is named Hu Wenchang; the spirit of Jiawu is named Wei Shangqing; the spirit of Jiachen is named Meng Feiqing; the spirit of Jiayin is named Ming Wenzhang.\" To visualize the names of these six spirits is to open and unblock the seven orifices, thus preventing illness and disease.\n\nThe *Fire-Soldier Talisman Charts* prepare the numinous passes. The *Red Youth’s Beheading Demons Record* enables the command of the Three-and-Five Fire Soldiers. The *Guardian Numinous Spirit Ruan* also states: \"In the cinnabar heavens of the south, the three qi flow with radiance; the fire-star revolves like a torch, illuminating the Great Yang. Above dwells the Red Essence, the Luminous Numinous Youth, who commands the fire soldiers and serves the Three Officials.\" This refers to the affairs of the Three-and-Five Fire-Soldier households.\n\nTalismans include those of the Eight Simplicities, Six Spirits, Yin-Yang, Jade Embryo, Immortal Refinement, Yin Essence, Flying Radiance, Yellow Florescence, Stone Radiance, Internal Transformation, Cavern Spirit, and Blue Heaven, among others. Charts include the *Six Jia Jade Maidens’ Spirit-Communication Chart*, the *Perfected Lord Taiyi’s Chart*, the *Eastern Well Bathing Chart*, the *Laozi’s Internal Vision Chart*, the *Western Ascent’s Eight Histories Chart*, and the *Nine Transformations’ Embracing Radiance Red Realm*, among others. These may be used to prepare and guard the empty passes.\n\nThe passes—such as the Three Passes and Four Passes—all exist within the human body. The front is elevated, the rear is low: such is the configuration of their positions.\n\nWielding a sword a hundred yards long while dancing amidst brocade feasts—such is the form of the divine soldiers and their swords. The Ten Absolutes span the void like fluttering fans, shaping qi in the emptiness with dazzling, sweeping radiance. Fire bells crown the heavens, plummeting like descending smoke: golden essence and fire bells pierce the celestial vault, their ranks and formations resembling clouds massing like drifting smoke. All this resides within the Yellow Gate between the brows. Visualize the fiery soldiers and their qi, all gathered at the Heavenly Court. The Heavenly Court, also called the Yellow Gate, is located between the brows. This is no mere branch or leaf—it is the very root of immortal cultivation.\n\n**Purple Clarity, Chapter Twenty-Nine**\nThe Purple Clarity Supreme August Lord of the Great Dao,\nAlso named the Jade Celestial Palace.\nFlanking the Great Mystery and Great Harmony in solemn attendance—\nThe Great Mystery and Great Harmony are the honorific titles of perfected immortals.\nThey transform and give life to the myriad things, making me immortal,\nFor such is the power of the Dao’s qi.\nAscending through the Ten Heavens in a jade chariot,\nRiding reverently onward.\nMeditate day and night for seven days without sleep,\nWith utmost sincerity and deepest resonance.\nIf you can cultivate this, you may endure forever,\nThe way of transcendent longevity.\nAccumulating merit and refining the self is no natural occurrence,\nBut through study one governs the Dao.\nThis arises from unwavering sincerity and holding fast to the One,\nGuarding the One as at first, with surplus to attain the Way.\nInternally guard with steadfastness the true within the true,\nProgressing step by step.\nIn emptiness and tranquility, the spirit comes of itself,\nFor the spirit receives through the void.\n\n**The Hundred Grains, Chapter Thirty**\nThe essence of the hundred grains is the essence of the earth,\nFor grains are the fruit of the soil, belonging to the yin class.\nTheir five flavors, though outwardly fine, reek of demonic filth,\nNot the true qi of pure emptiness.\nThey disturb the spirit and scatter the fetal qi,\nFetal qi refers to the flavorless flavor, the upright qi of spontaneity.\nIn the practice of qi absorption, there is a proper method for fetal breathing.\n*Ling* means loss.\nHow then can one reverse aging and return to infancy?\nHair turns from white to black, fallen teeth regrow.\nThis line should follow \"governing the spirit oneself,\" for here it seems out of place.\nThe three hun-souls drift aimlessly, the po-souls crumble and collapse—\n*Aimlessly* means without tranquility.\n*Crumble and collapse* means decay and ruin.\nWhy not consume the essence of the Great Harmony’s qi?\nAdvance in the way of refinement and absorption.\nThus one may enter the Yellow Tranquility without dying,\nYellow Tranquility is the accomplishment of the Yellow Court’s Way.\n\n**Heart Canon, Chapter Thirty-One**\nThe Heart Canon is the sovereign of the five viscera,\nFor the spirit receives through the void, and the heart is the dwelling of the spirit, hence its kingship.\nIn movement and stillness, contemplate the conduct of the Dao and virtue.\n*Contemplate* refers to meditating on the Cinnabar Origin Youth.\nThought is being, aspiration is non-being;\nWith thought, the heart is easily swayed before speech, but with non-being, the heart is ashen and the spirit whole—hence the conduct of the Dao and virtue.\nPurity and good qi naturally radiate luminous clarity,\nThrough constant contemplation.\nIn sitting and rising, I together serve as the pillar and beam,\nFor the spirit takes the body as its dwelling, thus they share the pillar and beam.\n*I* refers to the Cinnabar Origin Youth.\nBy day it shines with brilliance, by dusk it closes and conceals,\nAs Zhuangzi said: \"When awake, the hun-souls open; when asleep, the hun-souls intermingle and close.\"\nIt unblocks and harmonizes the flowery essence to regulate yin and yang,\nThis refers to the heart spirit’s engagement and withdrawal, corresponding with the eyes.\n*Flowery essence* is the essence of the eyes.\nWhen the heart opens, the eyes open; by day it is yang, by night it is yin—hence the regulation of yin and yang.\n\n**Passing Through, Chapter Thirty-Two**\nPassing through the Six Harmonies, concealed at dawn and dusk—\nThis describes the heart’s function and the origin of yin and yang.\nBy day it passes through, by night it conceals.\nThe Six Harmonies are the four directions, above and below.\nDawn and dusk take the north as night, belonging to the hidden and obscure.\nThe spirits of the two kidneys govern longevity,\nThe kidney spirit is Dark Obscurity.\nNurturing the infant belongs to the north, governing the night; one who refines the heart may attain long life.\nAs the *Master by the River* said: \"The kidneys store essence.\"\nDescending in turn to lodge in the Dipper’s first nine,\nNine is the yang number.\nThe Dipper is the Northern Asterism, governing the descent of yang—yang qi descends to unite with yin.\nThe *Book of Changes* says: \"Qian’s fortune lies in the primal head,\" where it is stored.\nKnowing the masculine yet guarding the feminine, one may avoid aging,\nGuarding the feminine is the text of \"hiding the nine.\"\nKnowing the white yet seeing the black, one sits in vigilant guard.\nAs the *Laozi* says: \"Know the white, guard the black; know the masculine, guard the feminine\"—this is the text of \"hiding the nine.\"\n\n**Liver Qi, Chapter Thirty-Three**\n\n**Liver Qi, Chapter Thirty-Three**\n\nThe liver’s qi surges, clear and enduring;\nThe liver resides in the east, governing spring—root of the generative qi.\nClear and enduring describe the aspect of its qi and complexion.\nArrayed like the six palaces, it gives rise to the Three Luminaries.\nBy storing the thought of generative qi, it illumines the five viscera and six bowels,\nAs the sun, moon, and stars radiate their primal brilliance.\nThe heart’s essence and intent concentrate within, unwavering—\nThis is the knowledge of the One.\nLike rain moistening the myriad things, the jade nectar nourishes the hundred limbs.\nMysterious fluid flows as clouds, banishing foulness and bearing fragrance—\nWhen true qi circulates freely, no calamity or illness arises.\nIt purifies the teeth and hair, refining the Five Directions;\nAs clouds drift and rain descends, nothing remains obstructed—hence the Five Directions and Five Viscera.\nDraw the fluid from the Mysterious Throat into the Bright Hall.\nThe way of swallowing saliva requires it to descend from the Mysterious Throat into the throat.\nThe throat, also called the Towering Pavilion, leads below to the Bright Hall,\nAnd beneath the Bright Hall lies the Grotto Chamber, and below that, the Cinnabar Field—\nThis is the middle region.\nBelow, the throat’s spirit connects with the numinous;\nLife and destiny depend upon the fluid and qi.\nSit in attendance beneath the Flowery Canopy, wandering the Noble Capital—\nThe Flowery Canopy is the lungs; the liver lies beneath them.\nThe Noble Capital is the Cinnabar Field.\nGently it courses through the Three Pures, resting upon the clear and cool—\nThe Three Emperors are the Lords of the Three Cinnabar Fields, also called Perfected Ones.\nThe liver’s qi, drifting and flowing, pervades the three Cinnabar Fields.\nAs the liver’s qi is the essence of the eyes, it rests upon the cool and clear.\nFive-colored cloud-qi swirls in verdant profusion—\nThe liver’s qi, mingling with the five viscera, forms clouds.\nClose the eyes and gaze inward to behold them,\nEver storing the thought, the five viscera appear of themselves.\nThus the heart’s spirits return to revere themselves—\nThe Crimson Youth is the Perfected One of the heart’s viscus,\nHarmonizing and uniting with the same palace in mutual reverence.\nThe Seven Mysterious Flowers open the Gate of Destiny—\nThe seven orifices flow freely, without stagnation.\nUnobstructed, the heavenly Dao abides in the Mysterious Root—\nThe body is the root.\nOne may yet return even at a hundred and twenty years;\nHasten to cultivate the practice, for time must not be lost.\nBeyond this, guarding the Dao becomes truly difficult—\nDeath draws near.\nOnly the Ninefold Transmutation and Eightfold Jade Elixir remain—\nThe Ninefold Transmutation Divine Elixir grants ascent to heaven in broad daylight.\nThe *Baopuzi’s* \"Discourse on the Nine Elixirs\" states: \"The Old Man perused the books of nurturing life and collected the methods for prolonging vision, having examined thousands of scrolls. None failed to regard the Returning Elixir and Golden Fluid as the great essentials.\"\nThe *Yellow Emperor’s Scripture of the Nine Cauldrons’ Divine Elixir* says: \"The Emperor consumed it and ascended as an immortal, his destiny conjoined with heaven and earth, riding clouds and driving dragons, entering and exiting the Grand Purity.\"\nThe Eight Jades are cinnabar, realgar, azurite, sulfur, mica, halite, lodestone, and orpiment.\nYet one must also refine the thought and store the Seven Primes—\nThough consuming the divine elixir, one must also practice the Way of the Yellow Court.\nThe Seven Primes refer to the true spirits of the seven stars and seven orifices.\nAlternatively, the Five Emperor Lords and the White Prime and Radiant Prime Lords transform into the Seven Prime Lords.\nThe *Scripture of the Grotto Chamber* states: \"To store the Seven Primes, recite the incantation: *Return the Prime to conceal the Dao, the Seven Stars shine resplendent.*\"\nThe Seven Stars are the Seven Primes.\nThe effulgences of the sun and moon rescue the aged and infirm—\nThe left eye governs the sun, the right eye the moon; the eyes govern the liver.\nDeath belongs to the east, the phase of wood.\nWood’s position is spring, spring is the generative qi—hence it rescues the aged and infirm.\nThe liver’s qi circulates endlessly without cease.\nAs *Zhuangzi* says: \"Fat is exhausted as kindling, yet fire is transmitted; life receives sustenance and destiny is stored therein.\"\n\n**Lung Qi, Chapter Thirty-Four**\n\nThe lung’s qi arises from the Triple Burner—\nThe *Central Yellow Scripture* states: \"The lung’s head is the Triple Burner.\"\nThe lung’s qi refers to the qi’s rinsing, which originates from the Triple Burner.\nThose who speak of the Triple Burner often fail to grasp its true nature, mistakenly regarding it as the tubes above the three viscera.\n\"Burner\" means heat, signifying the heat of the heart, liver, and lungs.\nWatch and listen in darkness, awaiting the Youth—\nThe Youth is the heart’s spirit, the one within the Crimson City.\n\n**Yuanyangzi says:** The Youth abides in the world through the eyes.\nThe Youth is the pupil of the eye.\nTo discern life and death, press the cheek with a finger—\nif light appears, one lives; if not, one dies.\nObserve the light in the eyes.\n\nRegulate the fivefold radiance: hair flourishes, teeth strengthen.\nThe fivefold radiance is the qi of the five viscera.\nThe *Immortal Scripture* states: \"Hair should be combed often, teeth should be clicked frequently.\"\nThirty-six swallows in the Jade Pool—\nThe mouth is the Jade Pool, also called the Flowery Pool.\nSwallowing saliva enters the Cinnabar Field, which is called \"irrigating the numinous root.\"\nOpening the hundred vessels, the blood and fluids begin—\nThe blood and fluids within the body originate from the mouth.\nThe complexion glows with the luster of gold and jade,\nthe hundred vessels open wide.\nTeeth grow firm, hair darkens, unaware of whiteness—\nreverting to youth, returning to infancy.\n\nPreserve this true spirit without negligence.\nFocus the spirit without slackening.\nRecall the seated mat in the Purple Palace—\nThe Purple Palace is the lung’s palace.\nThe seated mat is where the spirit finds repose.\nThe *Central Yellow Scripture* says: \"The lung’s head is the Triple Burner, the abode of the Dark Dragon Lord.\"\nWhen all spirits gather in assembly, they seek one another—\nWith the host of spirits united, how could perverse essences remain?\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Five: Concealing the Feathered Canopy**\n\nConceal the feathered canopy to gaze upon the heavenly abode—\nThis speaks of the spleen’s palace.\nThe spleen’s palace is the Yellow Court of the Cinnabar Field, the central earth of *wu* and *ji*.\nLooking upward, the liver and lungs become the canopy’s abode—\nThus is the spleen’s domain.\n\nPay homage to the Great Simplicity, joyfully calling one another.\nThe host of spirits gathers in the spleen’s palace, revering the Supreme Divine Immortals, delighting in mutual summoning—\nThis is the hun-soul uniting with the assembly of immortals.\nThe *Scripture of Numinous Simplicity* states: \"The Supreme Divine Immortals include the Lord of Great Simplicity, the Lord of Great Void, and the Lord of Luminous Purity; the multitude of immortals follow the Dao, roaming in joy.\"\n\nThe radiant spirits of the Eight Might expel perversity with rectitude—\nThe Eight Numinous Spirits possess luminous virtue, upholding the true method to dispel evil and guard the spleen’s palace.\nThe Eight Might are the Eight Numinous Spirits.\nThe *True Records* say: \"The incantation of the Northern Thearch for slaying ghosts states: 'The Seven Governors and Eight Numinous Ones, the Supreme White and Terrible, the long-skulled giant beasts, wielding the Thearch’s mallet, riding the three-tiered jade carriage, sternly driving the kui-dragons.'\"\nThis is the method of guardianship, destroying evil and banishing misfortune—it is fitting to recite it.\n\nThe spleen spirit returns to the stomach’s household—\nThe spleen serves the stomach’s function, thus the spirit returns to it.\nThe spleen spirit’s name is *Changzai*, its cognomen *Hunting*.\nThe spleen grinds food and aids digestion—this is the stomach’s work.\nThe *Central Yellow Scripture* says: \"The stomach is the Great Granary, the Great Granary is the spleen’s storehouse.\"\n\nNurturing the numinous root, it shall not wither—\nCultivating the Yellow Court’s spirit, cherishing and nourishing life, it shall not decay.\nThe spleen is the Yellow Court, the root of human life—\nFocus the mind on its cultivation to prolong years and attain immortality.\n\nSeal the Gate of Life to protect the Jade Capital—\nThe body is the Jade Capital; closing the Gate of Life in the Cinnabar Field preserves essence.\nMaster Primal Yang says: \"The Gate of Life is the place where the essence-qi of the lower Cinnabar Field enters and exits, the spirit’s passage.\"\nThe body is the Jade Capital, where the spirit gathers—like a metropolis.\n\nThe myriad spirits then repay with abundant longevity—\nThe host of numina bestows blessings, extending one’s years.\n*Repay* means recompense.\nThe myriad spirits reward nurturance, thus longevity overflows.\n\nThis is the spleen established in the Central Palace—\nThe spleen governs the Central Palace, the station of earth’s virtue.\nThe five viscera and six bowels are ruled by the Yellow Center—\nThe Yellow Center takes the spleen as its lord.\n\nAscend to unite with the Heavenly Gate and enter the Hall of Light—\nStore the qi of the five viscera and six bowels to ascend and unite with the Heavenly Gate.\nThe Heavenly Gate lies between the brows—this is the Heavenly Court.\nOne *cun* inward from the brows is the Hall of Light.\n\nPreserve the feminine and store the masculine, embracing the Three Lights—\nThe *Scripture of Laozi* states: \"Know the masculine, preserve the feminine.\"\nThe feminine is the *yin* valley, yielding and weak.\nThe Three Lights are the sun, moon, and stars.\n\nExternally square and internally round, the spirit abides within—\nExternally square and internally round is the form of the Hall of Light; the spleen spirit and True Unity dwell at the center.\n\nHarmonizing the blood and vessels, the five viscera flourish—\nThe spirit is tranquil, the mind is clear.\nBones turn green, sinews red, marrow like frost—\nThe hundred bones and nine orifices are all made true.\n\nThe spleen rescues the seven orifices, dispelling misfortune—\nThe spleen channels stomach-qi to respond to the external orifices, warding off evil and repelling malignity.\nThe spleen grinds food and aids digestion—ears hear clearly, eyes see brightly.\n\nThe sun and moon array themselves, setting forth *yin* and *yang*—\nQi spreads between the brows, left as *yang*, right as *yin*.\nThe sun governs *yang* and males, the moon governs *yin* and females.\n\nWhen the two spirits meet, they transform into jade nectar—\n*Yin* and *yang* harmonize to generate essence, transforming male and female.\n*Yin* and *yang* are the body’s natural fluids.\n\nTasteless yet the sustenance of heaven and man—\nWhen the spirit achieves harmony, it savors the flavorless.\n\nThe Child Cinnabar advances hunger with true yellow—\nThe youthful adept uses yellow qi as food to nourish it.\n*Advances* means qi.\nThe Child Cinnabar is the true adept, the true qi of the Cinnabar Field.\nThe spleen is the Central Yellow, grinding food.\n\nThus it is called *langao* and jade frost—\nThe color and form of the fluids and essence-qi.\n\nThe Supreme Concealed Ring of the Eight Pure Jades—\nThe throat is called the Tower of Nine Stories, named the Supreme Concealed Ring, containing the Eight Pure Jade Fluids.\nIt holds the Eight Pure Jade Fluids; the Crimson Palace’s Tower of Nine Stories has twelve rings, within which the Eight Purities produce fluids.\n\nIrrigating the Eight Fluids, the kidneys receive essence—\nIt nourishes the Eight Fluids, which enter the kidneys as jade essence; swallowing the fluids, they flow down into the kidneys’ palace, transforming into jade essence.\n\nConcealed in the Great Yin, beholding my form—\nThe kidneys are the Great Yin; *yang* lies concealed within—this is the embryo’s form.\nThe Great Yin is the Grotto Chamber.\nThis speaks of observing the form of the jade fluids.\n\nRaising the wind of the Three Mysteries, issuing forth the first green—\nThe kidneys belong to the Three Winters, their color is dark; when *yin* reaches its extreme, spring is born, emitting *yang* as green qi.\n*Raising the wind* means transformation.\nThe *yin* and *yang* qi and the kidneys’ qi make three—three gives birth to the myriad things, subtle and wondrous, thus called the Three Mysteries.\n*Issuing forth the first green* means the myriad things generate the color green.\nThe *Scripture of Great Peace* states: \"Accumulating purity forms green.\"\n\nIn the realm of the indistinct and imperceptible, reaching utmost clarity—\nThe Three Mysteries’ nature arises; their qi is subtle and wondrous, not to be sought in form or substance—\nOnly in the realm of the indistinct and imperceptible can one attain the state of utmost clarity, where the *yin* and *yang* qi are most subtle.\n\nPlaying upon the Terrace of Whirling Winds, beholding the Red-Born—\nRoaming atop the Terrace of Whirling Winds, one sees the True Person of the Red Child.\nThis speaks of harmonious qi transforming into the Red Child.\nThe Red Child is the True Person.\nThe Terrace of Whirling Winds is the gathering place of divine immortals.\n\nIn the carefree realm, nurturing the flourishing of the true—\nFrolicking upon the Terrace of Whirling Winds is the carefree realm, gazing upon the true sages.\nDelighting in the true qi beyond the material world is natural nurturance.\n\nInwardly gazing in silence, refining the five forms—\nRarely glimpsing the true sages, one turns the gaze inward to cultivate the body, preserving the spirit and qi for long life.\n\nThe Three Qi meander, attaining the numinous illumination—\nInwardly gazing to refine the form, the qi of the Three Fields circulates, achieving communion with the numinous spirits.\nThese are the qi of the Three Cinnabar Fields.\n\nThe Hidden Dragon conceals the zhi-clouds and jade blossoms—\nThe liver and gallbladder are the Hidden Dragon; the orifices and vessels are the inner zhi.\nThe spleen’s qi transforms the myriad fluids, all becoming jade blossoms.\nThe *Immortals’ Scripture* states: \"The liver and gallbladder are the Green Dragon,\" thus *concealing the zhi-clouds and jade blossoms* refers to the spleen’s qi and fluids.\n\nTo sate hunger and command the myriad spirits—\nZhi-blossoms grant freedom from hunger, driving and dispatching all spirits.\nWhen the Dao of imbibing qi is perfected, ghosts and gods are made to serve.\n\nAbove, the Darkest Mystery; below, the Tiger Seal—\nWhen the Dao of refinement is achieved, the heavens bestow the divine tiger and jade seal,\nthe raiment of immortals and transcendents.\nThe *Yuanlu Scripture* states: \"Transcendents possess the Dark Feather Canopy and the Divine Tiger Seal.\"\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Six: The Ritual of Bathing**\n\nBathe in utmost purity, forsaking rich meats and pungent aromas—\nThis marks the method of entering stillness and upholding the scripture.\n*Sheng* (盛) is the ancient form of *jing* (净, purity).\n*Fei* (肥) refers to fish, meat, and the five pungent plants.\n\nEnter the chamber facing east to recite the jade scripture—\nToward the Great Emperor, who resides in the east.\nWhen the count of ten thousand recitations is fulfilled, meaning becomes radiantly clear,\nemerging naturally from within the body.\n\nLet the hair flow unbound, free of desire, to abide in longevity—\nUnfettered and desireless, one attains long years.\nThe *Immortals’ Scripture* states: \"To ingest the Nine Radiances, first loosen the hair.\"\nThe *Embryonic Breathing Method* says: \"Lie supine with hair unbound.\"\nSome say: First cast aside worldly desires, loosen the hair, and let the pillow rise one inch and two fen.\nClasp the thumbs, make fists, close the eyes, and extend the arms five inches from the body.\nGargle the mouth’s fluid, swallow it fully, then gently draw in breath through the nose,\ntaking five or six breaths before exhaling—one inhalation and one exhalation count as a single breath.\nAfter ten exhalations, stretch the limbs; once stretched, repeat the practice.\nComplete forty-nine cycles to finish one round.\nYet the meaning here suggests that loosening the hair is not solely for this method,\nbut rather an expression of unbounded ease and natural attainment.\n\nThe five flavors all return to the upright qi—\nSpirit congeals, fluids flow, and the upright qi enters the viscera,\nmanifesting the five flavors in harmony.\nUnite the five into one—this is the natural Dao.\n\nCalm the heart, still the mind, and let no vexation arise—\nWith no heart to perceive, stillness comes naturally.\n*Men* (闷) means quietude, a state of serene purity.\nLaozi said: \"Its governance is unhurried, its people are simple and sincere.\"\n\nWhen the count is complete, body and spirit become refined—\nOnce the count is fulfilled, the body enters the wondrous void, a result of single-minded devotion.\nThe Jade Maiden of Yellow Blossom reveals her intent—\nThe spirit of the Cinnabar Field imparts the scripture’s meaning,\nthe yin spirit of the Cinnabar Field speaking to you.\n\nThe perfected one, now arrived, commands the Six Dings—\nWhen the spirit of the Yellow Court arrives, the Six Dings are made to serve.\nThe *perfected one* refers to the Dao practitioner.\n*Spirit’s arrival* means the essence has been attained.\nThe Six Dings were explained in earlier passages.\n\nTen recitations, four bows, to pay homage to the Most High—\nBowing to the Most High Lord Lao.\nThe *Jade Pure True Formula* states: \"Those who recite the *Eastern Florescence Jade Scripture*\nmust perform ten recitations and four bows.\"\nThe *Jade Scripture* refers to this text.\n\nFirst pay respects to the Great Emperor, then face north—\nThe Great Emperor resides in the east, the Seven Primes dwell in the north.\nThe *Inner Scripture of the Yellow Court* and the *Jade Book* flow unimpeded—\nThrough such cultivation and homage, the Dao of the Yellow Court is perfected,\nand the principles of the jade scripture become clear.\n\nThe one who transmits is called the master; the one who receives takes an oath—\nThis speaks of the merit of upholding the scripture, which qualifies one to teach others.\nThis text is worthy of reverence.\n\nCloud brocade, phoenix gauze, and golden bindings—\nThese serve as tokens of the oath’s sincerity.\nThey replace the cutting of hair or flesh—\nIn ancient times, oaths were sealed by cutting hair and smearing blood,\nbut now cloud brocade is used to preserve the body whole.\n\nHand in hand, ascend the mountain to partake of the liquid elixir—\nAs when transmitting the cinnabar scripture, one swears an oath with blood.\nThose who study the divine elixir and golden liquid must first take a solemn vow before receiving instruction.\n\nOnly when the golden script and jade luminaries are revealed may they be proclaimed—\nOnly after the oath is taken may the methods of transcendence be transmitted.\nThey are imparted to those who hold true faith.\n\nIf transmitted to one who receives them with care, like the Three Officials—\nThe Three Officials are Heaven, Earth, and Water.\nLet not the seven ancestors suffer dark misfortune—\nTo teach the unworthy brings calamity upon the seven generations.\nThe Most High’s subtle and wondrous path leads to transcendence—\nIt is most venerable and precious.\nThis is the scripture of the deathless Dao—\nThis text holds the way to longevity;

      "translated_text": "**The Fifty-Fifth Scroll of the *Ten Books on Cultivating the True: Annotated *Huangting Neijing Yujing***\n**Annotations and Preface to the *Huangting Neijing Yujing***\n*By Liangqiuxi*\n\nAll things take man as their master; man takes the One Heart as his foundation. Without a master, the Dharma does not arise; without the heart, the body cannot stand. The methods of the heart are manifold, their wondrous applications not singular. They possess the two bodies of being and non-being, responding to affairs as the moment demands. Thus, there are distinctions of ordinary and sagely, shallow and profound, foolish and wise, true and false—none but are discerned by the heart, for it governs the workings of perception.\n\nYet the Dao of all under heaven, though its paths diverge, converges in one; though its considerations are a hundredfold, they unite in a single end. Entering the wondrous from the hall is but two stages—expediency and reality—while embracing the near and tallying with the true, right and wrong become one vision.\n\nThere is the *Huangting Jing*, a secret treasure of Donghua. Truly, it is the essential subtlety of learning immortality, the root of feathered transformation. Though my study remains incomplete and my visualization but roughly grasped, I have modeled the myriad spirits into a single form. Its meaning encompasses four schools, its illumination clarifies seven characters; its pointers and metaphors speak of inner and outer in twofold discourse. In the pauses between poring over ancient texts and the breaths of exhalation and swallowing, I licked my brush, ground my ink, and thus bequeathed this humble offering.\n\nThe Great Lord of Fusang, the Divine King of Yang Valley, transmitted the *Huangting Neijing* to the Lady Wei of Nanyue. *Huang* is the color of the center; *Ting* is the midst of the four directions. Externally, it refers to the center of heaven, the center of man, and the center of earth; internally, it refers to the center of the brain, the center of the heart, and the center of the spleen. Thus, it is called *Huangting*. *Nei* is the heart; *Jing* is the form and image. Externally, it compares to the colors of the sun, moon, stars, clouds, and rosy dawn; internally, it compares to the forms of sinews, bones, and the viscera. The heart dwells within the body, storing and observing the images and colors of the whole—thus, it is called *Neijing*.\n\nAnother name is *Qin Xin* (\"Lute Heart\"). *Qin* means harmony; reciting it harmonizes the six palaces and pacifies the heart-spirit, enabling one to attain immortality. Another name is *The Great Emperor’s Golden Book*. The Great Lord of Fusang recites this scripture in his palace, inscribing it on golden tablets—hence, it is called *Golden Book*. Another name is *The Jade Chapters of Donghua*. Donghua is the name of the palaces of the eastern direction. In the Eastern Sea dwells the Green Lad, where jade maidens and immortals all chant and recite it, inscribing it on jade tablets—thus, it is called *Jade Chapters*.\n\nOne should purify oneself for ninety days and recite it ten thousand times, thereby harmonizing the three *hun*, refining the seven *po*, expelling the Three Corpses, and pacifying the six palaces. The five viscera will flourish, one will return to the state of an infant, and the hundred illnesses cannot harm, nor can calamities injure. When the ten thousand recitations are complete, one will naturally perceive spirits and gods with penetrating vision and internally behold the intestines and stomach, seeing the five viscera. At that time, the Perfected of the Yellow Court and the Jade Maiden of Donghua will teach you the arts of immortality.\n\nThose who constantly chant it will find their spirit-chamber bright and upright, their primordial embryo at peace, their numinous fluids flowing freely, their hundred passages harmonized and smooth, their blood and marrow abundant, their intestines and stomach empty yet full, their five viscera blossoming with radiance, their ears and eyes keen, their white hair returning to black, and their decayed teeth regrowing. As for repelling the tumult of demonic illnesses, it is because I have already obtained the names of the six wefts of the *hun*-essence.\n\nThe oral instructions of Qingxu Yuzhen state: The *Huangting Jing* is the secret teaching of the Great Lord of Fusang’s golden book for refining the true. Those who read and recite it must do so in a separate chamber, burning incense and maintaining purity before taking it up. This scripture repels the hundred demons. If one enters mountains and forests or dark, empty places and the heart trembles in fear, one should face north, recite the scripture once, and the spirit will settle, the mind will calm, as if traveling with a thousand companions. If one recites it ten thousand times, one’s eyes will see the five viscera and intestines, and the gods of all under heaven will be at one’s command. If afflicted by illness, one should visualize and recite it, and even those on the verge of death will recover.\n\nIn general, one must abstain from the six livestock, fishy and rank foods, the five pungent vegetables, and treading upon or covering filth. If one has trodden upon or covered filth, one should bathe, rinse the mouth, burn incense to the left and right, and recite the scripture once—then the hundred illnesses will be dispelled.\n\n**First Chapter of the Shangqing Section**\nBefore the Purple Radiance of the Void Sovereign of Shangqing...",

      "translated_text": "Within the Three Clarities’ realms lie the Grand Clarity, the Highest Clarity, and the Jade Clarity. These Three Clarities encompass the abodes of all great sages. According to the *Scripture of the Jade Terrace*, the Void Sovereign governs the domain of the Great Dao Lord—this is the realm of the Great Dao, which embraces the Three Clarities. The *Ten Titles of the Mystic Capital* further states: the Supreme Numinous Void Sovereign, the Heavenly Venerable, is the primordial title of the Originator. The Dao Lord, desiring to illuminate the origin of the seven-character verse within the Purple Radiance’s palace—also called the Palace of Purple Jade or the Crimson-White-Purple Imperial Palace—thus reveals the title of the Supreme Great Dao Jade Imperial Lord. \"Supreme\" denotes the highest reverence; as the *Scripture of Fundamental Conduct* records, this is the title of the Originator and the Five Elders. The Jade Dawn Lord is the title of the Yellow Lord.\n\nWhen dwelling in the Palace of Elixir Pearls to compose seven-character verses, the *Scripture of Esoteric Essentials* describes the immortal palaces: the Hall of Liao-Yang, the Gate of Elixir Pearls, the Chambers of Emerald Clouds, where the Dao Lord expounds the scriptures. This mirrors the human body’s inherent structure.\n\nDispersing and transforming the five forms, transmuting into myriad spirits—this refers to the ability to transform, relinquishing cleverness and wisdom, shedding form and intellect, merging with the Great Dao. Preceding essence and following traces, one temporarily employs spirit as a vessel. Spirit responds to circumstances, dispersing into five forms and transmuting into myriad spirits. Thus, the *Inner Chapter* of the *Yellow Court* derives its name from this principle.\n\nThe zither-heart in triple layers dances with the embryonic immortal—\"zither\" signifies harmony, \"layers\" denote accumulation. By harmonizing and accumulating the Three Elixir Fields into unity, the embryonic immortal resembles one in fetal breathing, where breath exists yet remains unexhaled. The nine qi radiate brilliance between the heavens. Within the Three Fields dwell nine qi, resplendent and illuminating all without exception. The *Scripture of the Great Cavern* states: the Three Elixir Fields, Three Origins, and Three Cavern Chambers combine into nine palaces, wherein reside the Heavenly Sovereigns. The nine po transform into nine qi, which further manifest as nine spirits.\n\nThe spirit’s canopy—youthful lads—generates purple mist.

      "translated_text": "The following text states: the brows are called the \"flowering canopy\" shading the luminous pearls. The \"spirit’s canopy\" refers to the brows; the \"luminous pearls,\" to the pupils of the eyes. The purple mist is the essence of subtle qi. This is called the *Jade Scripture*, which may be studied with precision. When writing arises from traces, focus leads to comprehension. Chanting it ten thousand times ascends one to the Three Heavens—when essence is perfected and spirit is replete, one’s name is inscribed in the Three Clarities. A thousand disasters dissipate, and a hundred illnesses heal, for both essence and spirit are fully present. One need not fear the ferocity of tigers and wolves, for no harm remains. This also reverses aging and extends longevity. This single chapter entirely expounds the Dao of the Yellow Court.\n\n**Chapter Two: Above the Yellow Court**\nAbove lies the ethereal soul, below the Pass of Origin. The \"ethereal soul\" pertains to heaven; the \"Pass of Origin,\" to earth. The soul is formless, while the Pass of Origin has substance—man models himself upon heaven and earth. On the left is Lesser Yang, on the right Greater Yin: left is east, right is west; the east gives birth, the west brings death. Behind lies the Hidden Gate, before the Gate of Life. \"Before\" is south; \"behind,\" north. The Hidden Gate refers to the two posterior orifices, signifying concealment. The Gate of Life refers to the seven anterior orifices, through which life is sustained. Together, they form the nine orifices. Exhale the sun, inhale the moon—store this in your breath. The sun and moon are the essence of yin and yang; exhale to the left, inhale to the right. The body possesses the qi of yin and yang, modeling itself upon the qi of heaven and earth. Exhalation is the issuing breath, inhalation the drawing breath; between them, the heart must store this awareness. The primordial qi unites with the constellations’ divisions. Primordial qi is one. Align the heart with the Dao, and visualize the luminous radiance of the sun, moon, and stars, arrayed and shining, so that the body’s divisions become distinct and merge with heaven. Purple mist rises and falls amid the Three Pure Clouds. The purple mist is the qi of the eyes’ essence. Visualize the Three Elixir Fields above and below, all suffused with white qi, flowing as one. It is also said: the eyes’ light possesses three colors—purple, azure, and green—forming the Three Pure Clouds. The *Scriptures of the Immortals* state: the incantation of Lady Cloud-Forest says, \"Sun and moon youths, the essence of the Three Clouds and the Two Eyes’ True Lords.\" Irrigate the Five Flowers to plant the numinous root. The qi of the Pure Clouds becomes jade liquid in the mouth; swallowing it irrigates the Five Flowers—the finest essences of the five viscera. The \"numinous root\" is the root of life, from which growth is planted. The seven fluids flow unimpeded between the jaws. The fluids of the seven orifices flow freely up and down, surging upward and circling downward, between the jaws and within the Hall of Light. Purple encircles yellow to enter the Elixir Field. This is an internal metaphor. The spleen’s qi is yellow; the eyes’ qi is purple. The seven fluids circulate, embracing yellow and returning with purple, entering and exiting with each breath to merge in the Elixir Field. There are three Elixir Fields, the roots of the numinous and the vital. According to the *Scripture of the Great Cavern*: three *fen* within the space between the brows form the Twin Elixir Fields; three *fen* into the bone’s edge form the Terrace and Gate, with the Azure Chamber on the left and the Purple Portal on the right, where two spirits reside. One *cun* inward from between the brows lies the Hall of Light, where the Luminous Youth Lord resides on the left, the Luminous Maiden Lord on the right, and the Mirror Spirit Lord in the center. Two *cun* inward lies the Cavern Chamber, where the Peerless Lord resides on the left, the White Origin Lord on the right, and the Yellow Elder Lord in the center. Three *cun* inward lies the Elixir Field, also called the Muddy Pellet Palace, where the Upper Origin Crimson Youth Lord resides on the left, and the Imperial Minister Lord on the right. Four *cun* inward lies the Flowing Pearl Palace, where the Flowing Pearl True Lord resides. Five *cun* inward lies the Jade Emperor’s Palace, where the Jade Clarity True Mother resides. One *cun* above the Hall of Light lies the Heavenly Court Palace, where the Upper Clarity True Maiden resides. One *cun* directly above the Cavern Chamber lies the Ultimate Truth Palace, where the Supreme Ultimate Emperor Lord resides. One *cun* directly above the Elixir Field lies the Elixir Mystery Palace, where the Central Yellow Grand Unity Lord resides. Two *cun* directly above the Flowing Pearl Palace lies the Supreme Sovereign Palace, where the Supreme Lord resides—masculine as yang, feminine as yin. Both men and women may cultivate this. The secluded chamber’s inner light illuminates the Gate of Yang. Within the hidden chamber, inwardly contemplate and store the heart’s intent; the eyes’ clarity discerns all, as if the sun and moon shine. The spirit is said to be without direction. The heart-spirit is boundless; when stored, it exists; when forgotten, it vanishes.\n\n**Chapter Three: The Mouth**\nThe mouth is the Jade Pool and the Palace of Grand Harmony. The liquid in the mouth is jade fluid, also called sweet spring or jade nectar, stored as water in the pool. The hundred joints are harmonized and supple, the five viscera balanced and at ease—all governed by the mouth as their palace lord. One version reads \"Palace of Grand Harmony,\" though this disrupts the rhyme. The *Scripture of the Great Cavern* states: visualize within the stomach’s opening a girl in infant form, unclothed, standing upright in the stomach’s tube, her mouth open to receive the soul’s liquid. Inhale the five qi, then fill the mouth with them, along with the inner and outer fluids, and swallow, sending them straight into the Mysterious Maiden’s mouth. After five repetitions, knock the teeth together three times and softly recite: \"Jade Clarity, exalted above the Nine Heavens and Nine Spirits, transform into a spirit maiden and descend into the stomach’s purity. Gold harmonizes with jade, the heart is at ease, the spirit bright. Feast upon the sun’s essence, and golden radiance fills the body.\" Rinse and swallow the numinous liquid, and no disaster shall approach. The true qi of the numinous liquid repels the perverse. The body generates radiant light, its qi fragrant as orchids. Without consuming the five grains, the body remains free of filth. A hundred evils are extinguished, and the countenance is refined as jade. Cultivate this diligently, and ascend to the Broad Cold Palace. The Broad Cold is the name of a celestial palace in the north. On the winter solstice, the moon retreats to the Broad Cold Palace, where it nurtures the moon’s soul in that land. Heavenly beings gather the essence of its splendor to distinguish the light of the sun and moon. Cultivate by day and night without sleep, and you shall become a true one. In movement, refine; in stillness, stabilize—thus one becomes a true person. Thunder roars and lightning flashes, yet the spirit remains undisturbed. Harmonize spirit and regulate qi; essence and soul are serene and joyful. Though thunder shakes, there is no fear. It is also said: thunder is lightning’s excitation, the result of knocking the teeth and storing thought—this is the spirit’s work, not to be called \"undisturbed.\"",

Concealed within, misty and dense, they support one another—\nThis refers to the forms of man and woman. Their hidden union is the natural Dao.\nAccording to the *Record of Inner and Outer Divine Mushrooms*:\n\"The fluids of the five viscera become mushrooms.\" This is the \"hidden mushroom,\" also called the \"inner mushroom.\"\n\n**Heavenly Pillar Chapter VI**\nTend the essence of the Heavenly Pillar with care—\nThe Heavenly Pillar is the nose, also called the Heavenly Terrace. The *Scripture of Dissolution and Rubbing* states: \"Frequently press the sides of the nose to balance the qi, which is called irrigating the Central Peak and inscribing the Emperor’s Register.\"\nOnce the numinous dwelling is purified, the Jade Emperor roams—\nThe face is the numinous dwelling, also called the Heavenly Abode. It is where the brows, eyes, and mouth reside, hence called the abode. Refine it to perfection, and the immortals will wander there. The *Great Cavern Scripture* says: \"The face is the foot-square abode,\" or sometimes called the \"crimson marsh.\"\nKeep the pathways unobstructed without cease—\nThe *Scripture of Great Simplicity and Cinnabar Radiance* states: \"On the face, constantly rub with both hands, following its contours without pause, to unblock the qi and vessels of the ears, eyes, and mouth.\"\nThe brows are named the Floral Canopy, shading the bright pearls—\nThe bright pearls are the eyes.\nThe Nine Darks and sun-moon illumine the hollow origin—\nThe *Five Spirits’ Conduct* states: \"Above the brows, trace the purple palace of the Hall of Light, with the sun on the left and the moon on the right.\" The *Jade Calendar Scripture* also says: \"Above the Great Clarity are nine-tiered canopies of five-colored blossoms; the human body has them too. One should visualize the pupils as bright as the sun and moon.\"\nWithin the abode dwells the Perfected, ever clad in cinnabar—\nThe True Dragon, spirit of the heart, is the Crimson-Walled Youth, also called the True One, the Red Child, the Child Cinnabar, or the Perfected. Visualizing him keeps him ever present, responding to the heart and reflecting its qi and color.\nIf one can truly see him, no illness will arise—\nMaster Primal Yang said: \"Constantly visualize the heart’s spirit, and there will be no sickness.\"\nCrimson pearls and numinous skirts, radiant and splendid—\nThe attire and colors of the heart’s spirit, an external metaphor.\nBeneath the tongue, the Dark Gullet is the shore of life and death—\nAn internal allusion. The Dark Gullet is the shore where fluids and essence flow. The *Root Scripture* states: \"The Dark Gullet is the qi vessel that receives the essence tally.\"\nExhaling clarity and inhaling mystery, the two qi shine—\nThis refers to the exhalation and inhalation of yin and yang qi, resplendent and luminous.\nIf you encounter this, you will ascend to the Celestial Han.\n\n**Supreme Dao Chapter VII**\nThe Supreme Dao is not burdensome; concentrate to preserve the true—\nDevotion brings attainment.\nThe Mud Pill and every joint have their spirits—\nSpirits are the wonders of the myriad things, named according to their forms.\nHair and gray blossoms are called Great Primal—\nWhite and black together are called gray, residing at the very top, hence the Great Primal.\nThe spirit of the brain’s essence-root is called Mud Pill—\nThe palace of the Cinnabar Field, the union of the Yellow Court, the master of the Grotto Chamber, the root of yin and yang—this is the image of the brain’s Mud Pill.\nThe spirit of the eyes’ clarity is called Radiant Mystery—\nThe eyes are likened to the sun and moon, atop the head, hence \"clarity above.\" Radiant Mystery is the pure color of the youthful spirit. An internal allusion.\nThe spirit of the nose’s jade ridge is called Numinous Firmness—\nThe ridge’s bone resembles jade, and the spirit’s qi connects to heaven, entering and exiting without exhaustion, hence Numinous Firmness.\nThe spirit of the ears’ emptiness is called Secluded Field—\nEmptiness and seclusion, where hearing is acute and the spirit resides, hence the Secluded Field.\nThe spirit of the tongue’s life-channel is called Proper Order—\nSwallowing fluids with the tongue, life’s essence flows unimpeded. Regulating the five flavors, each has its proper principle.\nThe spirit of the teeth’s blade-peaks is called Net-Thousand—\nThe teeth are firm and sharp, like blades that cut and crush, netting all things for consumption.\nThe spirit of the face governs the Mud Pill—\nThe brain’s spirit is the master of the hundred spirits of the Cinnabar Field.\nThe Nine Perfected of the Mud Pill each have their chambers—\nThe *Great Cavern Scripture* states: \"The Three Primes conceal transformations to form the Three Palaces; three times three makes nine, hence the Three Cinnabar Fields.\" There are also the Three Caverns and the Fish Union, totaling one or two Primes to make the Nine Palaces, where the Nine Perfected spirits reside. Three nines are twenty-seven spirits; when harmonized with a person, they should be visualized—these are also called the Nine August Ones. The Nine Souls transform into nine qi, becoming nine spirits, each dwelling in a grotto chamber.\nThe chambers are one inch square, situated within—\nEach chamber is one inch, and the brain has nine lobes.\nTogether they wear purple robes and flying gauze skirts—\nThe attire of the Nine Perfected mirrors the colors of qi, light as flight.\nSimply contemplate one division, and longevity will be endless—\nVisualizing the Nine Perfected is the way to immortality.\nThey do not each reside separately within the brain—\nThe spirits gather in the Cinnabar Field, where the Spring Spirit dwells.\nTheir seats are arrayed facing outward—\nThe spirits govern the Cinnabar Field but face outward to ward off misfortune. The *Eight Simplicities Scripture* states: \"The Perfected have nine ranks, facing outward in their positions: the Supreme Perfected face upward, the High Perfected south, the Great Perfected east, the Spirit Perfected west, the Mysterious Perfected north, the Immortal Perfected northeast, the Celestial Perfected southeast, the Void Perfected southwest, and the Utmost Perfected northwest.\" The Celestial Perfected see without looking, hear without listening, rectify without speaking, and follow without moving.\nTheir existence depends on the heart’s proper alignment—\nWhen the heart contemplates the Mysterious Perfected, inner and outer respond.\n\n**Heart Spirit Chapter VIII**\nThe spirit of the heart, Cinnabar Prime, is called Guarding Numinous—\nAn internal metaphor. The heart is the primal organ of the viscera, the color of southern fire, the abode of the spirit’s handle, hence Guarding Numinous.\nThe spirit of the lungs, Luminous Florescence, is called Empty Accomplishment—\nThe lungs are the heart’s floral canopy, luminous white, the color of western metal. The lungs’ color is white, their substance light and empty, hence Empty Accomplishment.\nThe spirit of the liver, Dragon Mist, is called Containing Clarity—\nThe liver’s position is the phase of wood, the color of the eastern Azure Dragon.

Clarity brings brightness to the eyes; turbidity brings dimness.\n\nThe spirit of the kidneys, Profound Darkness, is called Nurturing Infant—\nThe kidneys belong to water, hence *Profound Darkness*. Kidney essence generates the child, hence *Nurturing Infant*.\n\nThe spirit of the spleen, Ever-Present, is called Soul-Resting—\nThe spleen occupies the central earth phase, hence *Ever-Present*, the Yellow Court’s palace.

Externally, it draws from the eastern Azure Dragon’s thunderous resonance.\n\nThe six bowels and five viscera embody the spirits’ essence—\nThey sustain the entire body; none may be discarded, hence *the spirits’ essence*. The heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys are the five viscera; the stomach, large intestine, small intestine, bladder, triple burner, and gallbladder are the six bowels. The term *bowel* resembles a prefecture’s storehouse, taking the meaning of receiving things, hence *bowel*. The *viscera* each possess a distinct substance yet are collectively stored within the body, hence *viscera*. Much has been said of the triple burner, yet its true nature remains obscure—it lies above the heart, liver, and lungs, within the connecting vessels. The *Central Yellow Scripture* states: “The heart, liver, and lungs are the triple burner,” pointing to its location.\n\nYet according to the five phases’ colors, the spleen governs the five viscera—why then is the heart considered their master?\nThe answer: The heart resides at the center of the five viscera; its substance is emptiness and receptivity, the body of spirit-awareness and the source of function. Thus, it governs the directions and manifests its power, moving and acting to attain its numinous nature. It cannot be spoken in terms of images or numbers, nor grasped through material analogy—all is the Dao of spontaneity.\n\nAll operate within the heart, circulating the celestial scriptures—\nThe five viscera and six bowels each have their offices, modeling heaven and earth, aligning with yin and yang, the natural Dao of resonance and governance, hence *circulating the celestial scriptures*.\n\nPreserve them day and night to attain longevity—\nBy visualizing these five spirits with their corresponding colors, one holds fast to the undying Dao.\n\nThe *Scripture of Immortals* states: Envision the qi of the five viscera transforming into five-colored clouds, covering the body from above. The sun resides before you, the moon behind; the Azure Dragon to the left, the White Tiger to the right; the Vermilion Bird in front, the Dark Warrior behind—this is the Dao of dispelling evil and attaining longevity.\n\n**Lung Section Chapter IX**\nThe lung’s palace resembles a floral canopy—\nA golden palace, for the lungs stand above the five viscera, their lobes like a canopy.\n\nBelow sits a youth within the Jade Tower—\nThe youth is named *Luminous Florescence*; the lungs’ form is canopy-like, hence described as below. The *Jade Tower* refers to the white qi within the kidneys, connecting upward to the lungs.\n\nThe Seven Origins’ child governs qi-regulation—\nMaster Yuan Yang states: The Lords of the Seven Origins bear armor and hold talismans, repelling inauspicious evil and distributing qi to the seven orifices, governing the acuity of ears and eyes. The *Seven Origins* are the primordial qi beyond the seven orifices.\n\nExternally corresponding to the Central Peak’s nose and navel—\nThe *Central Peak* is the nose. It is also the navel, the navel being Kunlun. The nose is the gateway of the seven orifices, its position like that of a master.\n\nAdorned in silken robes with a yellow-cloud sash—\n*Silken* is the color of the lung’s membrane.

      "translated_text": "The three chambers refer to the Hall of Light, the Grotto Chamber, and the Cinnabar Field. They interconnect with the Flowing Pearl, the Five Thearchs, the Celestial Court, the Ultimate Truth, the Mysterious Cinnabar, the Mud-Pill Palace, the Grand August, and all other palaces—left and right, above and below—forming a seamless whole. With penetrating vision, one sees without distinction of inner or outer. By visualizing three threes as nine, uniting nine into one, clarity pervades the heavens, dissolving all boundaries of within and without.\n\nTo ingest the Five Sprouts and banish hunger and thirst—\nThe *Lingbao Scriptures* prescribe the method of consuming the Five Sprouts. The Five Sprouts are the generative *qi* of the Five Phases, corresponding to the primordial essence of the five viscera. As the scripture states: On the day of the Beginning of Spring, at cock’s crow, enter the chamber, face east, and bow nine times. Sit upright, click the teeth nine times, and visualize the Nine Worthies of the Eastern Quarter—Anbao, Hualin, Qingling, and the Nine Thousand Lords of the Primordial Elder—descending into the chamber in a dense cloud. Their forms enter through the mouth and descend directly into the liver palace. Recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Ninefold *qi* of the Azure Heavens,\nPrimordial essence of the Supreme Origin,\nVenerable Lords of the August Elder,\nClad in feathered azure,\nPresiding over the Celestial Offices,\nRadiant as Jupiter’s splendor,\nScattering brilliance and flowing fragrance,\nThey bathe my form.\nI ingest the morning auroras,\nI drink the essence of wood,\nNurturing the Azure Sprout,\nGuarding it with care.\nThe liver palace overflows,\nThe royal mushroom flourishes,\nProlonging years and refining complexion,\nRestoring the countenance of infancy.\nThe Five *qi* merge as one,\nHeaven and Earth endure in union.\"*\n\nAfterward, draw in the azure *qi* nine times and swallow, then ingest the twelve vermilion-script jade characters of the Eastern Quarter.\n\nThe Divine Splendor holds the towel as the Six Dings pay homage.\nThe Divine Splendor, as the *Jade Calendar Scripture* states, is the Five Maidens of the Mysterious Radiance of the Grand Yin, mothers of the Dao. Clad in five-colored crimson robes, they reside above the spleen palace, beneath the canopy of yellow clouds. The Six Dings are the six yin spirits of the jade maidens. The *Laozi’s Six Jia Talismanic Charts* state: Each Ding has its own spirit. The Ding-mao spirit is the Jade Maiden Sima Duyu, who governs the lunar months. The Ding-chou spirit is the Jade Maiden Zhao Ziwang, who harmonizes *qi*. The Ding-hai spirit is the Jade Maiden Zhang Wentong, who purifies all. The Ding-you spirit is the Jade Maiden Jiang Wengong, who brings joy. The Ding-wei spirit is the Jade Maiden Shi Shutong, who guards against harm. The Ding-si spirit is the Jade Maiden Cui Juqing, who hears the heart’s intent. To ingest the Flying Root is to practice the method of rinsing the Yellow Sprout; upon mastery, one commands the Six Ding spirits.\n\nGuard the chamber of essence and do not recklessly discharge it.\nThe chamber of essence refers to the three cinnabar fields, interconnected and unbroken. Its regulation lies in the heart, which is the middle cinnabar field—the source of urgency and ease, the root of truth and delusion. Sealed and preserved, it ensures longevity. This is the result of accumulating essence.\n\nArising from within the form, never apart—\nThis speaks of the heart directing *qi*, subtle and formless.\n\nThe three palaces lie near, easily concealed and gathered.\nThe three cinnabar fields’ true lords reside within the body. Concealing and gathering essence, the heart must serve as their sovereign.\n\nVoid and still, the plainness within emptiness—\nThis refers to external affairs. \"Plainness\" has two interpretations: First, the body should be as light and serene as silk suspended in the void. Second, the body’s inner emptiness should be as weightless as a vessel. Plainness is the natural state of tranquility; \"defilement\" refers to external distractions.\n\nThe nine chambers stand upright and empty, abodes of the numinous.\nThe nine chambers are the nine palaces within the head and the nine orifices of the body. When the upper palaces flourish and the nine orifices are aligned, they become the dwelling places of all spirits. The *Cavern Spirit Scripture* states: Heaven has nine stars, hence the Nine Heavens. Earth has nine palaces, hence the Nine Lands. Humans have nine orifices, hence the Nine Lives—referring to the origins of human existence.\n\nVisualize the hundred thoughts and observe the rhythm.\nVisualize the hundred spirits within the body, their breath rising and falling in accordance with the prescribed method. It is also said: \"Thousands upon thousands, hundreds upon hundreds, like layered mountains\"—all are divine images.\n\nCultivate the six palaces and do not let them decay.\nAccording to the *Cavern Spirit Scripture*, the six palaces are: the lungs as the Jade Hall Palace, the Office of the Chief Minister; the heart as the Crimson Palace, the Primordial Yang Office; the liver as the Clear and Cold Palace, the Orchid Terrace Office; the gallbladder as the Purple Tenuity Palace, the Boundless Office; the kidneys as the Pastoral Palace, the Supreme Harmony Office; and the spleen as the Central Yellow Palace, the Grand Simplicity Office.

Beyond the eight trigrams lie the Twelve Towers, which are the throat’s passages. The navel is the Lord of the Great One, master of life. It is also called Taiyuan, Kunlun, and Taiji, governing the thirteen thousand luminous essences within the body. The Twenty-Four Perfected emerge naturally. Heaven possesses twenty-four true qi, and the human body mirrors this.

It is the ancestral origin of spirits and the cavernous abode of the Perfected. One must visualize it according to the text. Together, we enter the Great Chamber and wander the Gate of the Celestial Pivot.\nAccording to the *Cavern Chamber Scripture*: Heaven possesses the Great Chamber, Jade Chamber, and Cloud Court. The Cloud Court is where the Central Yellow Elder Lord resides. The Jade Chamber is also called the Purple Chamber or Crimson Palace, collectively known as the Yellow Hall. The Flower Canopy spans the eastern and western chambers, connecting to the left and right Yellow Courts within. The human body mirrors this, as described above. The Celestial Pivot is the central axis. Delving deeply into tranquility, the Dao’s perfection—\nRefining essence in serenity, true qi roams freely.\nInward vision and subtle gaze reveal all truths.\nIn stillness and contemplation, the hundred spirits stand in array.

      "translated_text": "The Five Phases are Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. Their mutual generation proceeds thus: Metal engenders Water, Water engenders Wood, Wood engenders Fire, Fire engenders Earth, Earth engenders Metal, cycling endlessly. Their mutual restraint follows this pattern: Fire restrains Metal, Metal restrains Wood, Wood restrains Earth, Earth restrains Water, Water restrains Fire, likewise cycling without cease. This mutual generation is the Dao.\n\nReturning to the One—One is the number of Water, the root of the Five Phases’ Dao and the origin of the myriad things. As Laozi says: “The Dao gives birth to the One, the One gives birth to the Two, the Two gives birth to the Three, and the Three give birth to the myriad things.” The *Book of Changes* likewise states: “The Supreme Polarity gives rise to the Two Modes.” The Supreme Polarity is the One; the Two Modes are Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth give birth to the myriad things, and the myriad things in turn return to the One. The One is the designation of Non-Being, from which all things are accomplished—hence it is called “returning to the One.”\n\nThe Three and Five unite their qi in the nine-by-nine nodes. The *Scripture of Wondrous Perfection* states: “The Three are: in Heaven, the sun, moon, and stars; on Earth, pearls, jade, and gold—these are called the Three Treasures. In the human body, they are the ears, mouth, and nose—termed the Three Vitalities.” Heaven, Earth, and Humanity are the Three Powers, each containing them. The Five are the essence of the Sovereign; thus it is said “Three-Five unite.” Three times three makes nine.\n\nThe Three and Five that are contained regulate all categories, harmonize the myriad things, govern the transformation of yin and yang, cover and support Heaven and Earth, illuminate the Four Seas, and generate wind, rain, thunder, and lightning, the four seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, the alternations of cold, heat, warmth, and coolness, and the qi of purity and turbidity. None of the living things can arise without the union of Three and Five. Thus it is said: “The Dao of Heaven is not distant; the Three and Five return again.”\n\nThe Three and Five are the repository of Heaven and Earth, the essential convergence of the Six Directions, and the qi-nodes of the Nine Palaces. Nine times nine makes eighty-one, which forms a single chapter. One may employ the Eight Concealments to revolve through the Eight Guards. Within the Nine Palaces lie the arts of concealment and transformation—this is the *Hidden Writ of the Eight Qi Rushing to the Celestial Court*, called the Eight Evolutions. There are also the Eight Evolutions of the Supreme Polarity. Within the Supreme Polarity are the Three Lords: the first is the Supreme August Lord, the second is the Heavenly August Lord, and the third is the Yellow Elder Lord. The qi of the Three Origins and the essence of primordial chaos enter and exit the Palace of Grand Clarity in the Supreme Void, concealed and formless—thus is the Dao of long life attained.\n\nThe Crouching Ox guards the Dark Gate in ranked array. The Crouching Ox is an image of the kidneys; the kidneys are the Dark Gate. The *Central Yellow Scripture* states: “The left kidney is the Mysterious Wondrous Perfected One; the right kidney is the Mysterious Origin Lord.” When their ranks and positions are visualized, they become visible.\n\nThe Three Luminaries emerge at the boundary of life and death. Heaven’s Three Luminaries are the sun, moon, and stars; Earth’s Three Luminaries are the patterns of literature and brilliance; Humanity’s Three Luminaries are the ears, nose, and mouth—these mark the boundary of life and death.\n\nThe Cavern Chamber’s numinous image rivals the sun and moon. Visualize the Three Origins within the Cavern Chamber. The Cavern Chamber and Bright Hall have been explained above.\n\nThe father is the Muddy Pellet; the mother, the Feminine One. Within the Bright Hall are ruler and ministers; within the Cavern Chamber, husband and wife; within the Cinnabar Field, father and mother. The Muddy Pellet is the name of the brain spirit. The *Laozi* states: “Know the masculine, but keep to the feminine.” The Feminine is Non-Action—this is the One.\n\nThe Three Lights radiantly illumine the Chamber of the Child. Clarity extends in all four directions.\n\nIf one can preserve the Mysterious Perfected, all affairs are complete. As Zhuangzi says: “If one can guard the One, all affairs are complete.”\n\nThe spirit and essence of the body must not be lost. Constantly maintain this awareness, not neglecting it even for a moment.\n\n*Annotations to the Jade Scripture of the Yellow Court’s Inner Radiance from the Fifty-Sixth Scroll of the Ten Books on Cultivating Perfection* concludes.\n\n*Annotations to the Jade Scripture of the Yellow Court’s Inner Radiance from the Fifty-Seventh Scroll of the Ten Books on Cultivating Perfection*\n*Commentary by Liangqiouzi*",

the spleen spirit and True Unity dwell at the center.\n\nHarmonizing the blood and vessels, the five viscera flourish—\nThe spirit is tranquil, the mind is clear.\nBones turn green, sinews red, marrow like frost—\nThe hundred bones and nine orifices are all made true.\n\nThe spleen rescues the seven orifices, dispelling misfortune—\nThe spleen channels stomach-qi to respond to the external orifices, warding off evil and repelling malignity.\nThe spleen grinds food and aids digestion—ears hear clearly, eyes see brightly.\n\nThe sun and moon array themselves, setting forth *yin* and *yang*—\nQi spreads between the brows, left as *yang*, right as *yin*.\nThe sun governs *yang* and males, the moon governs *yin* and females.\n\nWhen the two spirits meet, they transform into jade nectar—\n*Yin* and *yang* harmonize to generate essence, transforming male and female.\n*Yin* and *yang* are the body’s natural fluids.\n\nTasteless yet the sustenance of heaven and man—\nWhen the spirit achieves harmony, it savors the flavorless.\n\nThe Child Cinnabar advances hunger with true yellow—\nThe youthful adept uses yellow qi as food to nourish it.\n*Advances* means qi.\nThe Child Cinnabar is the true adept, the true qi of the Cinnabar Field.\nThe spleen is the Central Yellow, grinding food.\n\nThus it is called *langao* and jade frost—\nThe color and form of the fluids and essence-qi.\n\nThe Supreme Concealed Ring of the Eight Pure Jades—\nThe throat is called the Tower of Nine Stories, named the Supreme Concealed Ring, containing the Eight Pure Jade Fluids.\nIt holds the Eight Pure Jade Fluids; the Crimson Palace’s Tower of Nine Stories has twelve rings, within which the Eight Purities produce fluids.\n\nIrrigating the Eight Fluids, the kidneys receive essence—\nIt nourishes the Eight Fluids, which enter the kidneys as jade essence; swallowing the fluids, they flow down into the kidneys’ palace, transforming into jade essence.\n\nConcealed in the Great Yin, beholding my form—\nThe kidneys are the Great Yin; *yang* lies concealed within—this is the embryo’s form.\nThe Great Yin is the Grotto Chamber.\nThis speaks of observing the form of the jade fluids.\n\nRaising the wind of the Three Mysteries, issuing forth the first green—\nThe kidneys belong to the Three Winters, their color is dark; when *yin* reaches its extreme, spring is born, emitting *yang* as green qi.\n*Raising the wind* means transformation.\nThe *yin* and *yang* qi and the kidneys’ qi make three—three gives birth to the myriad things, subtle and wondrous, thus called the Three Mysteries.\n*Issuing forth the first green* means the myriad things generate the color green.\nThe *Scripture of Great Peace* states: \"Accumulating purity forms green.\"\n\nIn the realm of the indistinct and imperceptible, reaching utmost clarity—\nThe Three Mysteries’ nature arises; their qi is subtle and wondrous, not to be sought in form or substance—\nOnly in the realm of the indistinct and imperceptible can one attain the state of utmost clarity, where the *yin* and *yang* qi are most subtle.\n\nPlaying upon the Terrace of Whirling Winds, beholding the Red-Born—\nRoaming atop the Terrace of Whirling Winds, one sees the True Person of the Red Child.\nThis speaks of harmonious qi transforming into the Red Child.\nThe Red Child is the True Person.\nThe Terrace of Whirling Winds is the gathering place of divine immortals.\n\nIn the carefree realm, nurturing the flourishing of the true—\nFrolicking upon the Terrace of Whirling Winds is the carefree realm, gazing upon the true sages.\nDelighting in the true qi beyond the material world is natural nurturance.\n\nInwardly gazing in silence, refining the five forms—\nRarely glimpsing the true sages, one turns the gaze inward to cultivate the body, preserving the spirit and qi for long life.\n\nThe Three Qi meander, attaining the numinous illumination—\nInwardly gazing to refine the form, the qi of the Three Fields circulates, achieving communion with the numinous spirits.\nThese are the qi of the Three Cinnabar Fields.\n\nThe Hidden Dragon conceals the zhi-clouds and jade blossoms—\nThe liver and gallbladder are the Hidden Dragon; the orifices and vessels are the inner zhi.\nThe spleen’s qi transforms the myriad fluids, all becoming jade blossoms.\nThe *Immortals’ Scripture* states: \"The liver and gallbladder are the Green Dragon,\" thus *concealing the zhi-clouds and jade blossoms* refers to the spleen’s qi and fluids.",
