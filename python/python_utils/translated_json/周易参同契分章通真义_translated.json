Carefully Applying to Complete Things\n\n**Preface to *Zhouyi Cantong Qi with Chapter Divisions and True Meaning***\n\nThe Preface states: According to the *Biographies of Divine Transcendents*, the Perfected One Wei Boyang was a native of Shangyu in Kuaiji. His family had long worn the hairpin of office, yet he alone did not serve, cultivating the True in seclusion and nurturing his aspiration in emptiness and non-being. Profound in literary expression and versed in all apocrypha and prognostications, he embraced simplicity and guarded his purity, following only the Dao. He regarded carriages and robes as mere husks and chaff.\n\nIt is unknown from which master he received transmission, but he obtained the *Ancient Text of the Dragon and Tiger Classic* and fully grasped its wondrous purport. Thereupon, he drew upon the *Zhouyi* to compose the *Cantong Qi* in three scrolls.\n\nMoreover, it is said that as the subtlest details remained unexhausted, he composed the *Supplement to Omissions and Elisions*, a single scroll further expounding the profound mysteries of the alchemical canon. His exposition often employed allegory and borrowed events, veiling and revealing through variant texts. He secretly imparted this to Xu, the Attendant of Qingzhou, who then concealed his name to annotate it. By the reigns of Emperors Xiao and Huan of the Later Han, the Master transmitted it to his fellow townsman Chunyu Shutong, whereupon it circulated in the world.\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* was composed because the Master held that the cultivation of the elixir shares the same path as the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth, and thus he relied upon the images of the *Zhouyi* to expound it. Without exception, he borrowed the relationship of ruler and minister to illustrate inner and outer, employed *li* and *kan* to directly indicate mercury and lead, arrayed *qian* and *kun* to establish the measure of the crucible, clarified them as father and mother to bind the beginning and end, united them as husband and wife to constrain their intercourse—likening them to male and female—manifested them in generation, analyzed them into yin and yang, guided them through inversion and reversion, and revealed them in the dark and new moons. He connected them with ascent and descent, matched them with the hexagrams and lines, embodied them in transformation, followed the handle of the Dipper to take its cyclical stars, divided them by dawn and dusk, and illuminated them through the clepsydra. Thus, *qian* and *kun* became the crucible, yin and yang the embankments, water and fire the mechanism of transformation, the Five Agents the aids, true lead the progenitor of the medicine, mysterious essence the foundation of the elixir, *kan* and *li* husband and wife, and Heaven and Earth father and mother. Mutually deploying the eight trigrams, driving and directing the four seasons, dividing the three hundred eighty-four lines to circulate the firing times, and revolving the five planets and twenty-eight constellations around the crucible—only then could the Water Tiger conceal its form, lodging in *geng* and *xin* to turn westward, and the Fire Dragon subdue its body, pursuing *jia* and *yi* to revolve eastward.\n\nThe *Zhouyi* states: \"The sage, having perceived the traces of the world, models them in form and likeness, symbolizing their proper attributes.\" The Master thus took up these images. If not one of utmost penetration in the world, who could have achieved this? Behold: he cleaved open the primordial chaos, split asunder the vast expanse, directly pointed to the numinous root of Heaven and Earth as the progenitor of the medicine, and clearly beheld the sagely mother of yin and yang as the foundation of the elixir. He disclosed the origin of the One Qi’s transformations and revealed the basis of the Great Foundry’s generation. If not one of utmost comprehension in the world, who could have achieved this?\n\nSome may fix the clepsydra, divide the sundial’s hours, cluster yin and yang, dispatch spirits and ghosts, compress the three thousand six hundred breaths of primordial qi, and revolve the seventy-two seasonal nodes. They may move the sixty-four hexagrams’ yin tally, with the Celestial Pass in hand, and drum the twenty-four solar terms’ yang fire, with the Earthly Axis at heart. Heaven and Earth cannot conceal the mechanism of creation, nor can yin and yang hide the root of nurturance. Thus, the spirit transforms the primordial square, and pure generation arises. If not one of utmost clarity in the world, who could have achieved this?\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* states: \"The Golden Crucible of Chaos, white and black in accord; the Dragon Horse descends its essence, the mare and stallion intermingle their qi. Like frost upon horse’s teeth, like jade and dog’s fangs; mercury dwells with the astonished maiden, cinnabar mercury unites with the infant’s body.\" Distinguishing the qualities of the medicine, subtly revealing the elixir’s form, it fully encompasses the latent work of completed transformation and greatly manifests the portents of what has yet to germinate. If not one of utmost numinosity in the world, who could have achieved this?\n\nSome borrow the images of the lines to embed these matters, yet dare not leak the celestial mechanism, nor can they bear to conceal the profound principle. Thus, they unfold without cease, repeatedly weaving and threading, unable to desist, and so form scrolls. Their aim is to point out the essential Dao, to draw in those to come, and to grieve for those embodied beings who, in the end, become mere ghosts of utter yin. If not one of utmost benevolence in the world, who could have achieved this?\n\nThere are those who penetrate the virtue of the Three Luminaries, roam the essence of the Eight Poles, ingest golden sand to transform their form and substance, and feed upon fiery mercury to refine their essence and spirit. Thus, they attain a body of pure yang, a spirit born in the true dwelling, shed the Three Corpses to transcend the Three Realms, and ascend to the Upper Clarity as Perfected Transcendents. If not one of utmost authenticity in the world, who could have achieved this?\n\nAs for those who divide the *True Cantong Qi* into chapters and meanings, they take borrowing as their fundamental principle, with no fixed standard above or below. The text is broad, yet the Dao is upright; the matters are manifest, yet the words are subtle. Later generations discuss it, each taking what they see: some divide the characters to debate, others combine the sentences to annotate. There is no lack of divergent streams and separate currents, giving rise to disputes over beauty and ugliness. Those of shallow learning seek to investigate it but find it difficult to attain immediate clarity. Since the discussions at the beginning and end differ, the right and wrong in their choices remain uncertain. Now, chapters and sentences are divided and fixed, valuing the coherence of principle. The meaning is upright, the text follows, and the \"Gate of Medicines\" is appended, thus organizing four scrolls into three volumes, comprising ninety chapters to correspond to the number of the Nine Yangs. It is titled *True Meaning of the Divided Chapters*.\n\nThe main text is written in red, while the ancillary meanings are in black, clearly visible for perusal. The upper volume contains forty chapters, the middle volume thirty-eight, and the lower volume twelve. Within it is the *Song of the Crucible*, whose words and principles are interlinked, and whose characters and phrases are fragmented, making division into chapters impossible. Thus, it is preserved alone to correspond to the number of the One Water, symbolizing the completion of the yin and yang numbers in the Dao of the elixir.\n\nFurthermore, following the *True Cantong Qi*, I have composed the *Illuminating Mirror: Diagrams and Secrets*, a single scroll appended to the end of the lower volume, to further open the doors and windows of the *True Cantong Qi*. Having received transmission from my teacher and devoted years of study, I dare not conceal the profound text. Thus, I have diligently completed this true meaning, hoping—if only by a ten-thousandth part—to bequeath it to later generations.\n\nPreface by Peng Xiao, the True One of Flying Crane Mountain, who embodies Unity.\n\n**The *Zhouyi Cantong Qi: Divided Chapters with Penetrating the True Meaning*, Volume One**\n\n*Annotated by Peng Xiao, the True One of Flying Crane Mountain, Gentleman for Court Audience, Acting External Minister of the Bureau of Sacrifices in the Ministry of Rites, and Bearer of the Purple Gold Fish Bag*\n\n**Chapter One: Qian and Kun as the Gateways of the *Yi***\n\nQian and Kun are the gateways of the *Yi*, the parents of all hexagrams.\nKan and Li serve as the wheel’s rim and axle, guiding its true course.\n\nBefore the Great Change, the Great Void, and the Great Beginning, though the supremely subtle was already latent, no signs or sprouts had yet appeared.\nAt the juncture of the Great Commencement, the Great Simplicity, and the Great Ultimate, there arose the undifferentiated, which is the state of primordial chaos.\nWithin it lay the essence of the True One, the origin of heaven and earth, the mother of the myriad things.\nOnce the One qi took form, the Two Modes divided. Thereafter came Qian and Kun, yin and yang, the Three Powers, the Five Phases, and the myriad things with their countless names.\nThus, Qian and Kun are established as the warp of heaven and earth, and the operation of yin and yang becomes the key to creation. With Qian and Kun in place, yin and yang move within them.\n\nMaster Wei states that the refinement of the Golden Elixir of Return aligns with the path of creation. Borrowing the images of the *Yi* to expound it, he invariably begins by delving into the True One’s chaotic qi of heaven and earth as the root foundation. Next, he draws upon the essential purity of Qian and Kun and the traces of their revolving motion as the model, following the numerical patterns of *Kan*, *Li*, *Pi*, and *Tai* to establish the instruments of punishment and virtue, and seizing the mechanism of yin-yang transformation to complete winter and summer.\nYin arises after noon; yang emerges at midnight.\nIn movement, it rises from the yang nine; in stillness, it follows the yin six—this is the great purport of elixir refinement.\nThus, Qian and Kun serve as the crucible and vessel, Kan and Li as the enclosing frame, water and fire as husband and wife, yin and yang as dragon and tiger, the Five Phases as the weft containing true essence, and the Three Powers as the warp gathering pure vitality.\nCold comes and heat departs, circulating through the three hundred and eighty-four lines;\nThe hare rises and the crow sinks, ascending and descending over three hundred and eighty-four days.\nAll these begin with the substance of the two hexagrams, Qian and Kun, and unfold into transformation.\nHence it is said: Qian and Kun are the gateways of the *Yi*, the parents of all hexagrams.\n\n**Chapter Two: The Four Hexagrams of the Female and Male***\nThe four hexagrams of the female and male serve as the lofty key.\n\nThe Way of yin and yang is enveloped and upheld, much like a skilled charioteer who follows the marking line, grasps the reins and bit, aligns the compass and square, and follows the wheel tracks. By abiding in the center to govern the exterior, the calculations are bound to the pitch pipes and calendrical cycles. The lunar phases consist of five or six days, with the warp and weft serving the sun’s command. Combined, they form sixty, with firmness and yielding possessing outer and inner aspects.\n\nIn refining the golden liquid and returning elixir, within the crucible lies the Golden Mother’s Flowery Pond—also called the Golden Womb Divine Chamber—where the four hexagrams Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li serve as the medicine. The \"lofty key\" refers to the pivotal mechanism, while \"enveloping\" means to encompass and enfold. Thus, there are the yin crucible and yang furnace, the firm fire and yielding tally, all adhering to the sixty-four hexagrams, cycling endlessly in mutual employment. Within this, the movements of spring, summer, autumn, and winter are enacted, dividing the twenty-four qi, segmenting the seventy-two seasonal nodes, compressing a year’s twelve months of climatic conditions into a single month, and further condensing a month’s conditions into the twelve hours of a day and night. The clepsydra is calibrated, the two crescents are distinguished, midnight and noon are separated, yin and yang are regulated, the dark and new moons are harmonized, the dragon and tiger are united, all in accordance with the great numbers of heaven and earth and the transformative mechanisms of yin and yang. If control and guidance are without error, and movement and transference are without loss, then externally, the tally of yin and yang is exchanged, and internally, the bodies of the dragon and tiger are generated. Thus it is said: A skilled craftsman follows the marking line without deviation; an able charioteer grasps the reins and bit without wavering, aligning with the compass and square and adhering to the wheel tracks. This is a metaphor for the adept refining the elixir in accordance with the fire phases.\n\nThe lunar phases of five or six days constitute thirty days; each day and night corresponds to one hexagram, totaling sixty hexagrams. The four hexagrams Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li are the parents of the medicine, the pivotal mechanism of the crucible and vessel. However, this does not refer to the numerical correspondence of day and night but rather encompasses the sixty-four hexagrams as a whole. \"The warp and weft serve the sun’s command\" means the hexagrams and lines serve as the warp of daily use, while the weft consists of the pitch pipes and calendrical calculations. \"Firmness and yielding possess outer and inner aspects\" refers to yang as firm and yin as yielding, with water and fire, metal and wood mutually serving as outer and inner.\n\n**Chapter Three: The Hexagrams *Zhun* and *Meng* at Dawn and Dusk**\nAt dawn, *Zhun* governs the affairs; by dusk, *Meng* assumes the duty. Each day and night corresponds to one hexagram, employed in sequential order. In circulating the fire phases of yin and yang’s ascent and descent day and night, all adhere to the sequence of one hexagram governing each day and night, beginning with the two hexagrams *Zhun* and *Meng* as the starting point. *Zhun* governs at dusk, and *Meng* at dawn, establishing this as the order.\n\n**Chapter Four: The Hexagrams *Ji* and *Wei* at Dusk and Dawn**\n*Ji* and *Wei* extend to dusk and dawn, ending only to begin anew. The celestial stems and earthly branches serve as the measure, with movement and stillness varying in earliness and lateness. *Ji* and *Wei* refer to the two hexagrams *Jiji* and *Weiji*. \"Dusk and dawn\" signify the alternation of dark and new moons, yin and yang, brightness and obscurity, going and returning. \"The celestial stems and earthly branches serve as the measure, with movement and stillness varying in earliness and lateness\" means yang pertains to movement and yin to stillness. Within the twelve hours, the early and late phases are divided, with yin and yang ascending and descending, the fire phases cycling endlessly in mutual employment.\n\n**Chapter Five: Spring and Summer Rely on the Inner Body**\nIn spring and summer, rely on the inner body, from *zi* to *chen* and *si*. In autumn and winter, employ the outer application, from *wu* to *xu* and *hai*. The yang fire advances the tally from *zi* to *si*, where pure yang governs, seeking outer yang from inner yin. The yin tally retreats the fire from *wu* to *hai*, where pure yin governs, with outer yang attaching to inner yin. This is the principle of the inner and outer bodies, the pattern of flourishing and decline, beginning with *Fu* and ending with *Kun*, all determined by the images of the lines.\n\n**Chapter Six: Rewards and Punishments Correspond to Spring and Autumn**\nRewards and punishments correspond to spring and autumn, with dusk and dawn aligning with cold and heat. The line texts embody benevolence and righteousness, expressing joy and anger in accordance with the seasons. Thus, they correspond to the four seasons, and the Five Phases attain their principles. The generative qi of spring is called reward; the astringent qi of autumn is called punishment. From *zi*, *chou*, and *yin* is spring; from *mao*, *chen*, and *si* is summer—these are the four yang fire phases. From *wu*, *wei*, and *shen* is autumn; from *you*, *xu*, and *hai* is winter—these are the yin tally phases. Within the twelve hours, the fire tally is circulated in accordance with these four seasons and Five Phases, aligning with dusk and dawn, cold and heat, benevolence and righteousness, joy and anger. The images of the lines must not deviate by even a hair’s breadth, hence it is said to be without loss. Within the crucible, the four seasons remain unblemished; within the image, cold and heat are unified—thus the elixir is surely formed.\n\nAn ancient song says:\nThe sage seizes the intent of creation,\nGrasping sun and moon to place within the crucible.\nSubtly inverting the essence of heaven and earth,\nBoring through yin and yang to move spirits and ghosts.\nWho recognizes the sun’s soul and moon’s spirit?\nThose who do are true immortals.\nRefining and ingesting for a thousand days,\nThe body, devoid of yin, cannot die.\n\nTherefore, in refining the golden liquid and returning elixir, if one does not model the images of heaven and earth’s creation and follow the natural principles, there will be no accomplishment.\n\n**Chapter Seven: Heaven and Earth Establish Their Positions**\nHeaven and earth establish their positions, and the *Yi* operates within them. Heaven and earth are the images of Qian and Kun. \"Establishing positions\" means arranging the positions of yin and yang in correspondence. The *Yi* refers to Kan and Li. Kan and Li are the two functions of Qian and Kun. The two functions have no fixed line positions, circulating through the six voids. Their coming and going are unfixed, their ascent and descent without constancy. Hidden and submerged, they transform within; encompassing and enveloping the myriad things, they serve as the warp and woof of the Dao.\n\n\"Heaven and earth establish their positions\" means modeling the crucible and vessel after the image of *Jiji*. \"The *Yi* operates within them\" refers to the circulation of yin and yang, Kan and Li, and the fire tally within. Having modeled the crucible and vessel after Qian and Kun, one further installs the Golden Mother within to complete the Three Powers of heaven, earth, and humanity.\n\nKan and Li, the two functions without fixed line positions, refer to the external application of water and fire, their movement and stillness without constancy. Thus they circulate through the six voids, their coming and going, ascent and descent without fixed positions. Now hidden, now manifest; now active, now latent—they serve as the origin of all transformations and the mother of generation and completion. Hence they are called the warp and woof of the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Eight: Using the Non-Existent to Govern the Existent**\nUsing the non-existent to govern the existent, the vessel’s function is emptiness. Thus in the ebb and flow, Kan and Li vanish. The non-existent is the dragon; the existent is the tiger. The non-existent is the yang qi of mercury; the existent is the yin essence of lead. Lead and mercury reside within the empty vessel yet cannot generate transformation on their own. Through the ascent and descent of Kan and Li, propelling the four seasons, generation and completion become manifest. This is using the empty vessel to govern the existent with the non-existent. As the *Ancient Text of the Dragon and Tiger Classic* states: \"When the existent and non-existent mutually govern, the Vermilion Bird flames in the void.\" Thus when yin grows, yang retreats; when yang rises, yin recedes. In the alternation of ebb and flow, Kan and Li vanish in accordance with the seasons.\n\n**Chapter Nine: No Careless Creation**\nNo careless creation in speech, no groundless emergence in discourse. Drawing on evidence to verify effects, measuring and aligning with the numinous. Extending categories to structure characters, tracing principles for proof. Kan is the lunar essence of *wu*; Li is the solar radiance of *ji*. Sun and moon form the *Yi*, their hardness and softness in balance. Earth reigns over the four seasons, weaving the beginning and end. Green, red, white, and black each occupy their quadrant, all receiving the power of the central palace, the achievement of *wu* and *ji*. The sage does not carelessly fabricate empty words to delude later generations. Thus he cites the sun and moon as evidence, measures and aligns with the numinous, distinguishes hardness and softness, points to metal and water, compares dragon and tiger to grasp their images, moves yin and yang to fathom their essence, completes the work with the five earths, and binds it with the four seasons. Thereupon green, red, white, and black cycle in succession, all receiving the power of *wu* and *ji*.\n\nKan as the lunar essence of *wu* is lunar yin; *wu* is yang. This is yin containing yang, resembling metal-tiger born within water. Li as the solar radiance of *ji* is solar yang; *ji* is yin. This is yang containing yin, resembling mercury-dragon born within fire. Thus in refining the elixir, one gathers the essence of sun and moon, harmonizes the numinous qi of yin and yang. When the cycle of stellar numbers is complete and the movement of yin and yang concludes, all credit returns to the virtue of earth, and the numinous essence is perfected. \"Extending categories to structure characters\" refers to the character *Yi* resembling sun and moon.\n\n**Chapter Ten: The *Yi* as Image**\nThe *Yi* is image. Suspended images manifesting clarity—none greater than the sun and moon. Exhausting the numinous to know transformation: when yang departs, yin arrives. The spokes interlock as the wheel turns, emerging and entering, rolling and unrolling. The *Yi* contains three hundred eighty-four lines; drawing lines to extract tally-signs, the tally-signs refer to the sixty-four hexagrams. From the dark moon to the dawn of the new moon, Zhen arrives to receive the tally. At this moment, heaven and earth unite their essence, sun and moon mutually embrace. The male yang spreads its dark offering; the female yin transforms the yellow womb. Chaos intermingles, the root foundation is established. Cultivating and nourishing the bud, concentrating spirit to form the body. All things tread forth from it; no movement fails to arise from it.\n\nThe *Yi* is image. It is the sun and moon uniting to form one. The golden liquid returning elixir is nothing other than the union of the sun and moon’s yin and yang essences. Thus the essence of yin and yang emerges and enters, rolls and unrolls; day and night cycle endlessly, returning to the beginning. Approximately sixty-four hexagrams, following three hundred eighty-four lines; drawing lines to extract tally-signs, fire follows advance and retreat. When yin comes, yang departs; when yang hides, yin acts. The qi of east and west intermingle; the sentiments of husband and wife harmonize. At this moment, Zhen arrives to receive the tally. Heaven and earth unite their essence; sun and moon join their souls and spirits. Chaos resembles the hen’s egg, the two crescents uniting like chaos. The yang dragon and yin tiger within chaos bear the qi of mutual resonance, establishing the root foundation, nurturing the bud, until spirit congeals into form, ultimately becoming a refined entity. Thus within the crucible chamber is another heaven and earth. All creatures, from the smallest to the greatest, arise from it.\n\nThe male yang belongs to heaven, hence the dark; the female yin belongs to earth, hence the yellow. These are the old yang and old yin. Qian the father and Kun the mother alternately employ the fire tally to its utmost. Thus one knows that within a single crucible, the transformations are each illuminated as heaven and earth’s movement, giving rise to the ten thousand kinds. If the fire timing is lost, the addition and subtraction overdone, cold and heat unseasonal, advance and retreat misaligned—then within heaven and earth, by what seasonal markers would things generate their images? By what yin and yang would dragon and tiger be born?\n\n**Chapter Eleven: At This, Confucius**\nAt this, Confucius praised the primal chaos, the virtue of Qian and Kun pervading the void. Investigating antiquity to the primordial sovereign, the *Guanju* established the beginning. The qi of marriage and capping intertwine; the first year then germinates. Confucius praised the Dao of the *Yi*, dividing Qian and Kun as the origin of the myriad things, establishing *Xian* and *Da* as the model for husband and wife. He split the primal chaos, chiseled the undifferentiated, revealed the forms of ghosts and spirits, and communicated the sentiments of heaven and earth. Thus ruler and minister, father and son, husband and wife, male and female, the five phases mutually generating and overcoming—the mechanism of the myriad things’ transformations was exhausted. Thus Qian and Kun illuminated their pervading void.\n\nTherefore Master Wei compared the *Yi* to establishing the crucible vessel, moving the celestial mechanism, uniting the forms of dragon and tiger, harmonizing the bodies of husband and wife. Initially, the complete non-existent form and essence resembled the primal chaos. After kindling the fire and moving the tally, the male and female essences intertwined. Thus the mutual longing of the *Guanju*, the seeking of marriage and capping. From the first kindling of fire, the first year’s germination is fitting. Sun abiding in moon, the dragon and tiger’s forms are established.\n\n**Chapter Twelve: The Sage Is Not Born in Vain**\n\nThe sage is not born in vain,\nGazing upward to perceive the manifest celestial tally.\nThe celestial tally advances and retreats,\nExpanding and contracting in accord with the seasons.\nThus the *Yi* governs the heart of Heaven.\n\nThe sage Fuxi, looking up and down,\nExamined the patterns and numbers,\nDiscerned the nature of the myriad things,\nAnd bequeathed them to later generations,\nThat those yet unenlightened might peer into the apertures of Heaven and Earth,\nPlunder the essence of yin and yang,\nGrasp the root of creation,\nAnd distinguish the forms of tally and response.\nMutual generation and overcoming,\nAdvance and retreat, expansion and contraction—\nAll lie within the palm’s grasp.\nThus it is said: the *Yi* governs the heart of Heaven.\n\nTherefore, he established the symbolic forms,\nProbed the utmost essence,\nPrepared the crucible and furnace,\nCirculated the tally and fire,\nFollowed the water clock’s measure,\nPracticed the hexagrams and lines,\nDetermined the hours,\nDivided the seasonal nodes,\nTo exhaust the great reckoning of Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: The *Fu* Hexagram Establishes the First Sprout**\n\nThe *Fu* hexagram establishes the first sprout,\nThe eldest son inheriting the father’s body,\nFounding the primal foundation upon the mother.\nEbb and flow respond to the pitch pipes,\nAfter three days, clarity emerges,\n*Zhen* receives *geng* from the west.\nOn the eighth day, *Dui* receives *ding*,\nThe first quarter hangs level as a plumb line.\nOn the fifteenth, the Qian body is complete,\nFully replete in *jia* and the eastern quarter.\nThe toad and hare, the moon’s spirit,\nGaze upon the hexagram’s nodes.\nWhen the reckoning is done, they bend and descend.\n\nThe *Fu* hexagram, in establishing the first sprout,\nConceives the mother.\nOn the fifteenth day, the Qian son and the double brightness ascend and descend,\nRelying upon the pivot of the Dipper.\n*Zhen* receives *geng* from the west.\nOn the eighth day, *Dui*—\nThe qi of sun and moon shines doubly bright.\n\nThe hare spews forth radiant light.\nIn the seven-to-eight Dao, the eldest son inherits the father’s body,\nEstablishing the six yin lines below, with the first changing to one yang line—\nHence it is called \"founding the first sprout.\"\nThis refers to the *Kun* hexagram’s lowest line transforming into a *Qian* line;\n*Qian* is the father, and from the third day the moon takes form, the yang number reaching its half.\nThe Wei Duke lodges this hexagram’s inner structure, completing *Zhen*,\nWhile *Kun* is *Zhen*’s root—thus it is said, \"establishing the primal foundation.\"\n*Zhen* is *Qian*’s eldest, and from here, following the seasons, it gradually transforms,\nUntil the fifteenth day, when it becomes pure—hence it is said, \"inheriting the father’s body.\"\nLikewise, by the eighth day, the first quarter is complete,\nAn analogy for the cauldron’s metal and water each at half.\nFullness emerges from the eastern quarter,\nThe toad and hare’s spirits an analogy for the cauldron’s metal and water,\nFull and perfected by the fire’s timing.\nThe moon’s waxing is likened to this: within half a month’s three *hou*,\nThe yang fire advances, drawing and adding within the cauldron,\nOver half a day’s six *chen*, receiving the fire tally,\nGiving rise to these transformations and first sprouts.\n\"Seven-to-eight Dao complete\" refers to the fifteenth day,\nWhen the *Qian* body is fully realized.\n\"Bending, descending low\" refers to what follows:\nFrom the sixteenth day onward, the yang fire retreats, and the yin tally is employed.\n\n**Sixteenth Turning Receives the Mandate, Chapter Fourteen**\nThe sixteenth turning receives the mandate,\n*Xun* meets *xin* at dawn’s level brightness.\n\n**Gen** aligns with south at *bing*,\nThe twenty-third day marks the waning half-moon.\n*Kun* and *yi* on the thirtieth day—\nIn the northeast, its companion is lost.\nWhen the cycle is exhausted, they yield to one another,\nThe succeeding body revives the dragon.\n\nThat \"the sixteenth turning receives the mandate\" means:\nFrom the sixteenth day onward, the yang fire first retreats,\nAnd the yin tally begins to arise.\nThat \"*Xun* meets *xin* at dawn’s level brightness\" is like\nThe initial advance of the yang fire,\nAs when the moon first appears on the third day.\nThat \"the twenty-third day marks the waning half-moon\" is again\nLike the waxing half-moon in meaning:\nMetal and water are each half.\nThat \"*Kun* and *yi* on the thirtieth day—\nIn the northeast, its companion is lost\" means:\nThe yin tally reaches this point,\nAnd the yang fire is entirely consumed.\n\nWithin one month, yin and yang are each half,\nYin and yang yield to one another,\nWater and fire depend on each other.\nWhen one month ends, it begins anew,\nAgain employing the *Fu* hexagram to commence,\nThus it is said: \"The succeeding body revives the dragon.\"\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: Ren and Gui Pair with Jia and Yi**\n*Ren* and *gui* pair with *jia* and *yi*,\n*Qian* and *Kun* encompass beginning and end.\nSeven and eight make fifteen,\nNine and six likewise correspond.\nThese four combine to thirty—\nThe yang qi seeks extinction and concealment.\nThe eight trigrams array the celestial bodies,\nTheir movements never stray from the center.\n\n*Ren* and *gui* are yin;\n*Jia* and *yi* are yang.\nYin and yang pair together,\nMeaning the elixir mother within the *Qian-Kun* cauldron\nReceives the qi of the yang dragon and yin tiger in union,\nThus it is said: \"*Qian* and *Kun* encompass beginning and end.\"\nSeven, eight, nine, and six—\nThese four combine to thirty days.\nWithin thirty days, seven and nine correspond to yang numbers,\nSix and eight to yin numbers.\n*Qian* and *Kun* each take half,\nAnd by the thirtieth day, all is complete—\nYin tally and yang fire both conclude.\nThus, when firing the elixir for one month,\nOne follows the eight trigrams,\nArraying the celestial bodies in their courses,\nAdvancing and withdrawing, ascending and descending\nThrough north and south, east and west,\nSo that yin and yang unfold and coil,\nAnd metal and water harmonize.\nIf the firing is mistimed,\nDrought and flood disrupt the seasons;\nThe principles of generation and completion are impaired,\nAnd the dragon and tiger’s forms are hard to retain.\nThose who practice firing must ponder this carefully.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: The Primordial Essence is Subtle and Hard to Perceive**\nThe primordial essence is subtle and hard to perceive—\nOne infers and verifies it through signs.\nWhen at rest, observe its image,\nAnd model its form accordingly.\nErect a gnomon as a standard,\nDivining auspices to determine fortune or misfortune.\nIssue commands in accord with the seasons,\nNever missing the moment when the lines shift.\nAbove, examine the patterns of the *River Chart*,\nBelow, sequence the earth’s flowing forms.\nIn the center, investigate the human heart,\nComparing and considering the Three Powers.\nIn movement, follow the hexagrams’ rhythms;\nIn stillness, rely on the *Image*’s words.\n*Qian* and *Kun* are put into practice—\nOnly then are heaven and earth ordered.\nHow could one fail to be cautious?\n\n**The Primordial Essence as the Divine Spirit Within the Crucible**\nThe primordial essence is the divine spirit and true essence within the crucible—\nThe primordial *qi* of heaven and earth.\nThough it cannot be grasped or seen,\nIt subtly follows the mechanisms of transformation,\nGiving birth to and nurturing the myriad things.\nSince it is profound and obscure, difficult to perceive,\nOne must infer and verify it through signs,\nErect a gnomon as a standard,\nAnd issue commands in accord with celestial omens.\nThus, gazing upward, one observes the patterns of heaven;\nLooking downward, one examines the principles of earth.\nOnly then can one unite the *hun* and *po* of heaven and earth,\nHarmonize the contraction and expansion of *yin* and *yang*,\nEstablish the Three Powers,\nAnd determine the auspicious and the sovereign.\nFollowing the hexagrams’ images and the lines’ words,\nDistinguishing dawn and dusk,\nRegulating ascent and descent,\nOne achieves the harmony of *Qian* and *Kun*,\nThe union of husband and wife,\nThe intercourse of dragon and tiger,\nAnd the ordering of heaven and earth.\n\nThe above discusses adhering to the clepsydra’s marks,\nDirecting the talismanic fire,\nClarifying withdrawal and addition,\nDistinguishing advance and retreat—\nNever deviating from the celestial motions of sun, moon, and stars.\nThus, within the crucible, the divine essence of the myriad things\nIs produced in accord with the four seasons.\nHow could the adept who directs the talismanic fire fail to be cautious?\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: The First Principle of Governance**\nThe first principle of governance\nEncompasses the subtle and the hidden,\nOpening and unfolding to spread forth treasures.\nIt is the pivotal handle of the essential Dao,\nThe guiding thread of transformation.\nWhen the lines and images stir within,\nFortune and misfortune arise without.\nThe five planets move in errant or orderly paths,\nResponding to the seasons and stirring in resonance.\nWhen the four and seven fall into discord,\nThey shift and stray, bowing and rising.\n\nThe first principle of governance\nIs the sequential beginning of the adept who directs the talismanic fire.\nOnce the metal is smelted and the crucible formed,\nOne must secure and seal it, ensuring subtlety and concealment.\nTo \"open and unfold, spreading forth treasures\"\nMeans the inner metal flows freely, its fluids abundant,\nGold and water depending on one another.\nAgain, one follows the handle of the Dipper,\nTraversing the twelve earthly branches,\nAligning the five planets within the four and seven.\nThe four and seven are the twenty-eight constellations.\n\nIf the celestial omens and portents fall into disarray, their signs and tokens failing to align, then fortune and misfortune arise from the moving lines, and the talismanic fire loses its rhythm with dawn and dusk. This causes the outer five planets to fall into chaos, and the inner five qi to lose harmony. When the four and seven fall into discord, the circumpolar stars scatter and stray, and the crucible fails to generate and complete its work.\n\nThough the external fire moves and progresses, if the inner talisman remains still and unresponsive, then the celestial soul and terrestrial spirit fail to unite. Thus, the stars fall into disorder, the sun and moon deviate from their courses, the four seasons lose their balance, and the myriad things fail to flourish. This arises from the mismanagement of the fire, where summer and autumn lose their proper measure, causing the crucible to suffer from unseasonable drought or deluge.\n\n**Section Seventeen of the *Compendium of Literary Governance* states:**\nThe Literary Governance Compendium summons the scrutiny of the Three Ducal Ministers.\nAll officials and functionaries oversee their respective domains.\n\nThe Literary Governance Compendium refers to the Dipper’s handle bearing the basket—six stars known as the Hall of Literature: the first is the Supreme General, the second the Secondary General, the third the Noble Minister, the fourth the Director of Destinies, the fifth the Director of Records, and the sixth the Director of Calamities. The Three Ducal Ministers are the six stars beneath the Dipper’s handle, paired two by two, called the Three Terraces. Those who govern the world assist the Son of Heaven above in harmonizing yin and yang and aligning the four seasons, while below they ensure the suitability of the myriad things, enabling ministers and grandees to fulfill their duties. This mirrors the crucible receiving the qi of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things, generating and transforming within.\n\nWhen yin and yang fall into discord and the four seasons lose their proper measure, it is like the adept who directs the talismanic fire, whose regulation and balance exceed or fall short—hence the admonition and reproof.\n\nThe elixir of golden fluid and returning cinnabar lies hidden in the two words: *lead* and *fire*. To complete the work from beginning to end, one must first obtain true lead, and then—even more difficult—true fire. How could this be lightly discussed? Thus, Master Wei expounded it broadly, fearing that later generations might yet fall into confusion.\n\n**Section Nineteen: The Sun Harmonizes the Essence of the Five Phases**\nThe sun harmonizes the essence of the five phases,\nThe moon receives the discipline of the six pitch-pipes.\nFive and six make thirty degrees,\nOnce the cycle is complete, it begins anew.\nTracing origins and seeking ends,\nThe threads of survival and decay.\nAt times the ruler grows arrogant and excessive,\nOverbearing and transgressing the Dao.\nAt times the minister is devious and obsequious,\nHis conduct straying from the proper path.\nThe waxing and waning of crescents and full moons,\nDiscord and change bring misfortune and blame.\nThose who enforce the law admonish and criticize,\nTheir clumsy outcries leaving faults for the ruler to bear.\n\nThe sun harmonizing the essence of the five phases means that each month it once conjoins with the moon. The moon receiving the discipline of the six pitch-pipes refers to the metal and water within the crucible, which each month receive half of the pitch-pipe qi. There are six pitch-pipes and six complementary pipes, which the sun and moon share between them. The sun, moon, five planets, and celestial weave together generate the myriad things, just as the crucible receives the external qi of yin and yang, the talismanic rise and fall of midnight and noon, the essence of the five planets’ progression, and the purest union of sun and moon. Adversity and prosperity follow one another, survival and decay intertwine, cycling anew—beginning with *Return* and ending with *Receptive*.\n\nWithin the divine chamber, the yin essence resides in the central palace, dwelling in the virtue of earth and symbolizing the ruler. If the crucible responds internally but fails to act externally with focus, it is because the sovereign has grown arrogant and excessive, causing tribute from the four directions to cease. When ministers are devious and obsequious, the timing of the fire falls into error, the waxing and waning of crescents and full moons become irregular, and the dark and new moons bring misfortune and blame—all of which are laid at the ruler’s feet. The ruler is the metal essence, the earth virtue, the divine chamber. The ministers are the five phases, the six pitch-pipes, the essence and qi. Success or failure rests with the adept who directs the talismanic fire. From this, the maidservant flees, the red dragon bolts, the divine essence departs—what then remains of the golden fluid to seek?\n\n**Section Twenty: The Celestial Pole Receives the Proper Measure**\nThe celestial pole receives the proper measure,\nAt ease and unhurried, it governs below.\n\nThe Hall of Light enacts governance, yet the state’s origin harms the Dao.\nWithin, it nurtures the self—tranquil, empty, and primal.\nTracing back to the hidden and luminous, it inwardly illumines the body’s form.\nSeal the mouth, fortify the numinous root.\nThe Three Lights sink into obscurity, warming and nourishing the child-pearl.\nThough unseen to the eye, it is near and easily sought.\n\nThat the celestial pole receives the proper measure,\nAt ease and unhurried, governing below—\nThis speaks of the divine embryo dwelling in the central chamber,\nA metaphor for the ruler abiding in the Hall of Light, like the North Star.\nThe qi of yin and yang and the five phases are the ministers.\nWhen ruler and ministers govern within,\nLike the North Star fixed at heaven’s center,\nThen the qi of yin and yang and the five phases harmonize in accord,\nThe fluids of metal and water in the crucible-chamber flourish,\nAnd the ruler may nurture the self,\nAbiding in tranquility, effortlessly empty and primal,\nUndergoing transformation naturally.\n\n“Tracing back to the hidden and luminous, inwardly illumining the body’s form”:\nThis means that metal can conceal brightness yet also illuminate itself,\nGaining fire to amplify its radiance.\n“Seal the mouth”:\nThe *dui* is the mouth.\nOnce the golden tiger’s numinous root is settled in the central chamber,\nOne must secure and seal the crucible’s opening,\nDirecting the true essence of the Three Lights inward\nTo nurse and nourish the child-pearl and numinous mercury—\nHence, “the Three Lights sink into obscurity.”\nThe Three Lights are the yang fire, yin tally, and golden embryo,\nSymbolizing the sun, moon, and stars.\nExternally, there are also Three Lights,\nDistributed within the moving and still lines and time-marks,\nWithin the yin and yang tally-fires,\nTransforming and taking form.\nFor within and without, each possesses the body of yin-yang transformation—\nThis cannot be exhaustively discussed.\nAt this subtle and wondrous stage,\nWithout oral transmission, it is difficult to convey in writing.\n\nWhen the golden mercury is in the crucible,\nIts transformations are unfathomable, beyond perception.\nYet if one employs the celestial mechanism to regulate it,\nUsing the pivot of the cosmic pattern,\nThen the golden mercury dares not flee,\nAnd dragon and tiger may unite in mating—\nHence, “it is near and easily sought.”\nThe *Yin Fu Jing* says:\n“The cosmos is in your hands,\nThe myriad transformations arise in your body.”\n\n**Section Twenty-One: The Yellow Center Gradually Permeates Order**\nThe yellow center gradually permeates order,\nMoistening and suffusing the skin.\nFirst rectify, then refine to the end;\nThe trunk stands firm, yet the branch may not be grasped.\nThe One veils and conceals it—\nThe world knows it not.\nThe *Book of Changes* says:\n“The noble one, yellow at the center, permeates order,\nAbides in proper position, embodies integrity—\nExcellence resides within,\nFlowing through the four limbs,\nManifesting in deeds—\nThis is the height of beauty.”\nThis speaks of the golden tiger in the crucible,\nFirst receiving the external qi of yin and yang,\nGradually moistening and suffusing the skin.\nOnce it first receives qi, the initial sprout arises,\nThe branches and trunk are rectified,\nAnd in the end, the fruit is borne.\nIt is a metaphor for the true mercury of golden cinnabar first sprouting buds.\nThe One is water.\nFor the water’s root is true metal within the vessel,\nSecurely sealed and concealed—\nOrdinary people cannot know it.\n\n**Section Twenty-Two: Supreme Virtue Acts Not**\nSupreme virtue acts not,\nNor seeks through scrutiny.\n\nLesser virtue acts,\nIts function unceasing.\nWhen the upper aperture closes, it is called \"being\";\nWhen the lower aperture closes, it is called \"non-being.\"\nNon-being serves to uphold the above,\nWhere the divine virtue resides.\nThis is the method of the two apertures,\nWhere the golden qi mutually requires.\n\nThe supreme virtue is water above;\nThe lesser virtue is fire below.\nWater and fire conjoin—\nThis is called Qian and Kun.\nWater above remains ever still,\nAbiding in yin without acting,\nNor seeking through scrutiny.\nFire below moves ceaselessly,\nCirculating through the twelve celestial stems,\nIts function unending.\n\nThe upper closure is called \"being\"—inner water.\nThe lower closure is called \"non-being\"—outer fire.\nNon-being serves to uphold the above,\nFor fire circulates the qi of the four seasons and five phases,\nNourishing and upholding the divine embryo.\nThus it is said, \"Above, the divine virtue resides\"—\nThe divine embryo of golden mercury.\nAs for \"the method of the two apertures, where the golden qi mutually requires,\"\nIt speaks of the two qi of water and fire, yin and yang,\nMutually sealed and requiring one another to form the divine medicine—\nAll else is but a deviant path.\n\nMaster Wei was enlightened by this chapter,\nProfoundly clarifying the great principles of the method and the归旨 of the divine medicine.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three: Knowing the White, Guarding the Black**\nKnow the white, guard the black,\nAnd the numinous brightness will come of itself.\nThe white is the essence of metal;\nThe black is the foundation of water.\nWater is the pivot of the Dao,\nIts number named \"One.\"\nThe beginning of yin and yang,\nMysteriously containing the yellow sprout.\nThe master of the five metals,\nThe river chariot of the north.\nThus lead appears black without,\nYet harbors golden splendor within.\nClad in coarse robes while holding jade,\nOutwardly a madman.\n\nThe white is metal;\nThe black is water.\n\nKnowing the root and function of metal and water as the foundation of the medicine,\nThe divine essence will naturally arise within the vessel—\nThus it is said the numinous brightness comes of itself.\nWhite metal is born from water,\nAnd so becomes the divine vessel.\nThe body of water is inexhaustible,\nFor the dual natures of metal and water form the pivot of the Dao.\nWater’s number is One,\nThe origin of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, the five phases, and the myriad things.\nWater is One, fire Two, wood Three, metal Four, earth Five.\n\"Mysteriously containing the yellow sprout\" refers to metal and water generating the yellow sprout.\nThe master of the five metals is the river chariot of the north.\nThe river chariot is water and fire,\nFor the qi of water and fire circulate to generate the five phases.\nThus lead appears black without yet harbors golden splendor within:\nBefore lead is transformed into white metal,\nIt lies concealed within the ore,\nOutwardly black while inwardly holding golden radiance—\nLike the madman clad in coarse robes while holding jade.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four: Metal as the Mother of Water**\nMetal is the mother of water,\nThe mother conceals the child in her womb.\nWater is the child of metal,\nThe child shelters in the mother’s womb.\nThe perfected one is most subtle,\nNow present, now absent.\nLike a great abyss with flowing locks,\nNow sinking, now rising.\nRetreating, they disperse,\nEach guarding their own domain.\nWater is born from metal,\nMetal is the mother of water—\nThis means metal generates water,\nYet in turn conceals its form within water,\nThus hiding the child in the womb.\n\"Water is the child of metal, the child shelters in the mother’s womb\" refers to black lead transforming in quality,\nTaking its place in the west as the white tiger’s metal womb.\nWater contains metal and again conceals its essence within the metal womb—\nTrue mercury is such.\n\"The perfected one is most subtle, each guarding their own domain\" means true mercury,\nDriven by the external talismanic fire within the mother’s womb,\nNow sinks, now rises,\nFlying and hiding without constancy,\nNow present, now absent.\nYet with the response of talismans and the advance and retreat of fire,\nEach guards its own boundary,\nDaring not to transgress.\nMaster Wei was enlightened by this chapter,\nProfoundly clarifying the inner images of perception,\nYet still unable to match the state of true essence’s subtle and imperceptible arising and vanishing.\nHow wondrous! How divine!\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: The White of Gathering**\n\nGathering the white of its kind,\nRefining it yields the vermilion.\nTempered as defense and guard,\nWhite enfolds the steadfast core.\nSquare and round, a inch in span,\nBlended yet mutually bound.\nBorn before heaven and earth,\nMajestic and supremely exalted.\n\n\"Gathering the white of its kind\" means that at the first stirring of movement, white metal takes precedence.\n\"Refining it yields the vermilion\" means that in the forging, next the blazing fire completes the crimson.\n\"Tempered as defense and guard, white enfolds the steadfast core\" describes how white metal serves as the divine chamber.\n\"Square and round, a inch in span, blended yet mutually bound\" means the metal womb resembles the primordial chaos in form. It is crafted by dividing the upper and lower crescents, with the central chamber square and round, an inch in diameter, to house the true mercury. Once the two children unite, the seal is firm and impervious, allowing yin and yang to correspond without the slightest leak, nurturing the dragon and tiger. As the *Ancient Song* says: \"When the womb’s seal is unbroken, transformation occurs in an instant.\"\n\n\"Born before heaven and earth, majestic and supremely exalted\" means that true lead existed before the primordial chaos of heaven and earth. Lead attained unity and took form, then gradually gave rise to heaven and earth, yin and yang, the five phases, the myriad things, and all beings. Thus, lead is the parent of heaven and earth, the root and origin of yin and yang. The sage delves into the root of heaven and earth’s parents to establish the foundation of the great elixir, gathering the pure essence of yin and yang to form the substance of the returned cinnabar. This is no ordinary creation of things.\n\nTherefore, at the outset of elixir refinement, one must take the root of heaven and earth as the root of the medicine, and the mother of yin and yang as the mother of the cinnabar. If one cannot grasp the arising of heaven and earth and yin and yang in this interval, it is not the way of the golden liquid and returned cinnabar. If one uses what is produced *after* the existence of heaven and earth and yin and yang—such as the five metals, eight minerals, plant juices, wood ash, morning frost, night dew, snow broth, ice water, green salt, white brine, or any miscellaneous substances—how could success be anything but difficult?\n\nLet those of like mind ponder this deeply, and in time, they will awaken. Thus, a later passage says: \"After ten thousand repetitions, it may be grasped in darkness; the divine and enlightened may then fashion a person.\" This is also found in the eighty-third chapter of the lower volume.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Adjoining Walls and Gates**\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Adjoining Walls and Gates**\n\nWalls stand beside the gates, resembling Penglai’s isles.\nEncircled and sealed, the four paths wind and turn.\nGuarded and secured, they bar all wickedness.\nCurved chambers connect, warding against the unforeseen.\nHere, primordial reflection thrives—\nyet sorrow and toil find no place.\nThe chamber brims with spirit and qi,\nnone can detain it.\nThose who preserve it flourish;\nthose who lose it perish.\nIn movement and stillness, rest and repose,\nit ever abides with the practitioner.\n\nWhen refining the Returned Cinnabar,\nthere are the altar, furnace, and cauldron,\nupper and lower conjoined,\nshaped like Penglai’s isles, open on all sides.\nWithin the cauldron lies the divine chamber, the golden embryo,\nwinding and linked;\nwithout, the pivot and bolts secure it,\nsealing all gaps to prevent the true qi from escaping.\nOnly then are stray thoughts stilled,\nand primordial toil dispelled.\nThough the defenses are firm,\nand the chamber fills with spirit and qi,\none must still regulate and harmonize yin and yang,\nexchanging and applying effort,\nto retain and bind the true essence,\nthus accomplishing transformation.\nIf the fire-tally is misapplied,\neven with true essence within,\nit will scatter and flee.\nAll depends on tempering water and fire,\npreserving without loss—\nthen prosperity follows.\nThus, the true qi’s movement and stillness,\nrest and repose,\never abide with the practitioner.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: The Methods of Testing and Concealment**\n\nThe methods of testing and concealment—\ninward vision gives rise to thought.\nTreading the steps of the Dipper’s lodges,\nthe six jia follow the days and hours.\nThe yin path suppresses nine and one,\nconfusing and disrupting the primordial womb.\nIngesting qi, the intestines rumble;\nexhaling the upright, inhaling external evil.\nDay and night, no outward sleep,\nfrom dark moon to new, never ceasing.\nThe body grows daily weary,\ndistracted, as if deranged.\nThe hundred vessels seethe and race,\nunable to settle in clarity.\nPiling earth to raise altars,\nmorning and evening, reverent offerings.\nGhostly forms appear,\ndreams stir with sighs.\nThe heart rejoices, the mind delights,\nself-assured of long life.\nYet suddenly, death cuts short the years,\nthe corpse decays, the bones exposed.\nEvery act goes awry,\nperverse and contrary, the pivot lost.\nSuch methods are many,\na thousand strands, ten thousand more.\nAdvancing and retreating, they defy the Yellow and the Old,\ntwisting and turning, they rebel against the Nine Capitals.\n\nThese are not the true methods of the Hidden Treasury—those #37 twisted paths that rebel against the Nine Capitals. Master Wei observes that世人 do not grasp the fundamental origin of the Great Dao/Way, instead rushing toward the crooked byways of side doors. Thus, some inwardly contemplate petty tricks, treading the steps of the demonic net, manipulating the Six Jia days and celestial stems—mere introductory steps for the ignorant. Others, when facing circumstances, #38 engage in qi-absorption, bedroom defenses, bending and stretching, grasping and sealing, holding breath and swallowing saliva. Through these, qi becomes chaotic, spirit exhausted, hun-souls wounded, po-souls wearied, leading the yang spirit to flee its palace, while yin thieves plunder the lungs and liver. This arises from internal and external mutual encroachment, the clash of yin and yang hours, the seven po wandering like dead corpses, the Three Corpses battling in the eyes, the hundred vessels seething, the Three Fields in turmoil. What was meant to ensure longevity instead harms life—how can one attain clarity and stillness?\n\nOthers externally erect altars and carve jade, sacrificing to wanton ghosts, hoping to encounter the Dao/Way and beg for extended years. This causes ghostly qi to infect essence and spirit, evil winds to rise in the heart’s chamber, sometimes manifesting in dreams, sometimes in apparitions of form and sound. They believe longevity is within reach, unaware that their fate lies in their own hands—only to hasten their demise, abandoning decayed remains. Such practices are manifold, all classified as heterodox paths.\n\nSeeking to move yet remaining stuck, desiring speed yet slowing further, they rebel against the utmost truth, deviate from heavenly principle, falsely claim the title of \"high Dao,\" openly defy the writings of the Yellow Emperor, obscure the true teachings, and entirely lose the essence of the Old Master’s intent. Therefore, Master Wei does not wish people to practice side doors. He urges them to #39 directly enter the true Dao/Way. Even if the various Hidden Treasury methods yield minor achievements, they ultimately cannot escape death and decay. Only the Golden Elixir of Returning Mercury, after ingestion, reverses aging into infancy, attaining the rank of True Person, sharing the eternal longevity of heaven’s position. Thus, the following text states:\n\nGolden sand enters the five viscera,\nmist scatters like wind and rain.\nSteaming and permeating the four limbs,\ncomplexion becomes joyful, lustrous, and fine.\nWhite hair turns black,\nnew teeth regrow.\nThe old man reverts to youthful vigor,\nthe aged woman becomes a maiden.\nTransforming form to escape worldly calamities,\nthey are called True Persons.\n\nAs stated in Chapter Thirty-Two of this scroll. The *Scripture of the Yellow Court* also says: \"One hundred and twenty years may still be restored, but beyond this, cultivating the Dao/Way becomes truly difficult. One must await the Ninefold Transmutation and Eightfold Jade Elixir, where the radiance of sun and moon rescues the old and frail.\" Thus, it is clear that this method is the supreme path of ascending to heaven in broad daylight and achieving immortality.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight: The Enlightened Examine These Principles**\nThe enlightened examine these principles,\nsuddenly understanding their origin.\nDiligently practicing them,\nday and night without rest.\nAfter three years of ingesting the elixir,\nthey lightly ascend and travel afar.\nCrossing fire without burning,\nentering water without getting wet.\nAble to appear and disappear at will,\neternally joyful, free from sorrow.\nWhen the Dao/Way is accomplished and virtue/power perfected,\nthey conceal themselves, awaiting the time.\nThe Great One #40 then summons them to dwell in the Central Continent #41.\nWhen merits are fulfilled and ascension achieved,\nthey receive the register and chart.\nMaster Wei warns those who love the Dao/Way: examine and fathom these principles, and you will naturally attain clarity. Once obtained, practice diligently day and night, never slackening from beginning to end. After the elixir is completed and ingested for three years, you will lightly ascend and travel afar, unobstructed by water or fire, able to sit and vanish #42 or stand and appear. Secretly performing hidden virtues, concealing yourself to await the time, the Great One will summon you to relocate to the Central Continent. Counting the days, you will ascend, receive the register and chart.\n\nThe Great One is the overseer of elixir refinement. The Central Continent is the Divine Continent. When世人 first attain the Dao/Way, their names are engraved on golden tablets in this land #43, receiving the register and chart #44 to achieve ascension.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: The Fire Record Is Not Falsely Composed**\nThe *Fire Record* is not falsely composed;\nit elucidates the *Book of Changes* to clarify it.\nThe crescent-moon method of the crucible,\nwith the White Tiger as the pivot of refinement.\nMercury as the flowing pearl of the sun,\naccompanied by the Azure Dragon.\nRaising the east to meet the west,\nhun and po naturally bind each other.\nThe waxing moon corresponds to the number eight of Dui,\nthe waning moon to the number eight of Gen.\nWhen the essences of both phases merge,\nthe body of Qian and Kun is formed.\nTwo eights make a pound,\nthe Dao/Way of the *Changes* stands upright, unshaken.\nA pound has three hundred eighty-four zhu,\nalso corresponding to the number of hexagrams and lines.\nThough the fire has its record,\nit must be regulated by the Dao/Way of the *Changes*,\nfollowing the hexagrams and lines,\ncirculating through Pi and Tai.\nThe crucible is shaped like an inverted moon,\nthe metal tiger within serves as the mechanism of the medicine.\nCinnabar mercury and the Azure Dragon,\npursued by the Vermilion Bird of Bing and Ding,\nfollow the time to enter the golden womb together—\nhence called \"raising the east to meet the west.\"\nHun and po refer to the eastern dragon’s hun and the western tiger’s po.\nThe upper and lower phases combine to form #45 a pound’s weight,\ndivided into three hundred eighty-four zhu,\ncorresponding to the two eights of a month’s cycle.\nThus, the forms of Qian and Kun are complete,\nmatching the number of a celestial revolution.\n\n**Chapter Thirty: Gold Enters the Fierce Fire**\nGold enters the fierce fire,\nits color unaltered, its radiance undiminished.\nSince the beginning of creation,\nthe sun and moon have never lost their brightness,\ngold has never lost its weight,\nthe sun and moon retain their usual forms.\nGold is originally born from the moon,\nreceiving the sun’s tally at the new moon.\nGold returns to its mother,\nas the moon wanes, the sun envelops it.\nConcealing its frame,\nit sinks into the cavernous void.\nGold regains its original nature,\nits majestic light rejoicing in the crucible #46.\nThe five phases overcome each other,\nfire overcomes metal.\nYet when metal encounters fire, it can be forged into tools,\nneither harming the other.\nThus, the golden womb in the crucible does not dissipate,\nits golden color growing ever more luminous.\nSince the establishment of the Qian and Kun crucible,\nthe sun and moon’s essences enter within,\nmutually benefiting each other,\nboth retaining their brightness.\nThe gold’s weight remains unchanged,\nthe sun and moon perpetually encircle and illuminate.\nGold is originally born from the moon—\ngold is yin essence, residing in the west,\nhence it is said that gold is born from the moon.\nFrom the new moon, it receives the tally of the celestial stems,\nthus generating gold.\n\nWhen gold returns to its mother,\nthe moon receives its mandate in turn,\ngold reverts to water.\nWhen the moon wanes and yang qi is wholly spent,\nthen gold and water—these two substances—\nnaturally enfold each other in their nature,\nconcealing their frame and sinking into the cavernous void.\nThe waning moon mirrors the year’s end,\nthe new moon mirrors the year’s beginning.\n\nWhen gold and water take form,\nthe crucible-chamber perpetually contains harmonious qi,\nand thus success is manifest—\nhence it is said the crucible rejoices #47.\nJoy brings harmony,\nharmony brings gold and water to congeal,\nand the Dao of spontaneity is complete.\n\n**The Union of Zi and Wu Numbers, Third Stanza, Thirty-First**\nThe zi and wu numbers unite as three,\nwhile wu and ji are called five.\nWhen three and five harmonize,\nthe eight minerals stand as the proper norm.\nInhalation and exhalation yearn for each other #48,\nlonging to become husband and wife.\nYellow earth is gold’s father,\nflowing pearl is water’s mother #49.\nWater takes earth as its ghost—\nearth subdues water, preventing its rise.\nThe Vermilion Bird is the essence of fire,\nholding balance to adjust victory and defeat.\nWhen water prevails, fire is extinguished,\nboth perishing to return to the fertile earth.\nOnce the three natures unite,\ntheir original nature shares a common ancestor.\n\nThe zi water is numbered one,\nthe wu fire is numbered two—\ntogether they form three.\nWu-ji earth is numbered five,\nand three and five combine to make eight—\nthus, when three and five harmonize,\nthe eight minerals stand as the proper norm.\nHence the Azure Dragon exhales to the White Tiger,\nthe White Tiger inhales the dragon’s essence,\ntheir breath mutually nourishing,\nlonging to become husband and wife.\n\nYellow earth is gold’s father,\nflowing pearl is water’s mother—\nearth restrains #50 cinnabar mercury,\npreventing its dispersal,\nas when the tail of fire governs earth in the four seasons.\nGold is wholly from the Vermilion Bird’s fire spirit,\nwhich regulates victory and defeat.\nWhen water prevails, fire is extinguished,\nand both wane and new moon come to an end,\ntheir merit returning to earth’s virtue.\nWhen the three natures unite,\ntheir original nature shares a common ancestor #51—\nfor gold and fire emerge from the single qi of water,\nbeing born within the primordial nine qi before heaven and earth,\ncapable of generating the five phases,\nnot merely the two substances of gold and fire.\n\n**The Sesame Extends Longevity, Thirty-Second Stanza**\nSesame extends longevity,\nreturned elixir may enter the mouth.\nGold’s nature does not decay,\nthus it is the treasure of the ten thousand things.\nWhen adepts ingest it,\ntheir lifespan is prolonged.\nEarth travels through the four seasons,\nguarding its boundaries and setting its rules.\nGolden sand enters the five viscera,\ndispersing like mist or wind and rain.\nSteaming and permeating the four limbs,\nthe complexion becomes joyful and lustrous.\nWhite hair all turns black,\nfallen teeth regrow in their original place.\nOld men regain youthful vigor,\naged women become maidens.\nTransforming their form, they escape worldly calamity—\nsesame is called the True Person.\n\nSesame #52—\nif mere mortals consume it and still gain longevity,\nhow much more so when the golden liquid returned elixir enters the mouth?\nThe elixir first arises from true gold—\ntrue gold #53, the mother of things,\nserves as the foundation of the medicine,\nnourishing the viscera and limbs,\nenabling long vision.\n\nIs not long life assured?\nGold’s essence never decays.\nIt is the ancestor of heaven and earth’s primordial qi—\nas the *Daodejing* says:\n“The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth,\nthe named is the mother of the ten thousand things.”\nBefore heaven and earth, a single qi was the origin,\ngiving birth to the ten thousand images.\nGold is the root of water,\nand thus true gold, the mother, can produce golden sand and returned elixir.\n\nEarth travels through the four seasons—\nMaster Wei uses this to instruct later generations in refining and ingesting the medicine.\nWhen this sand enters the mouth,\nit marks the beginning and end of the elixir path.\nIts numinous wonders are beyond measure,\nlike clouds, mist, wind, and rain—\nrejuvenating the old and reversing aging,\ntransforming the myriad paths to enter the five phases,\ncausing teeth to regrow and hair to darken,\nthus achieving long life.\n\n**Lead Powder Cast into Fire, Thirty-Third Stanza**\nWhen lead powder is cast into fire,\nits color is ruined and it reverts to lead.\nWhen ice and snow meet warm broth,\nthey dissolve and become the Great Mystery.\nGold takes cinnabar as its master,\nreceiving harmony from mercury.\nTransformation arises from its authenticity,\nbeginning and end naturally follow one another.\nIf you wish to become an immortal through ingestion,\nyou must use substances of the same kind.\nPlant millet to grow millet,\nhatch chickens with their own eggs #54.\nAssisting nature with its own kind,\nthings are easily shaped and refined.\nCan fish eyes be considered pearls?\nCan thistles and thorns become fine boxes?\nOnly those of the same kind follow one another—\ndeviant methods do not produce treasures.\n\nThus, swallows and sparrows do not give birth to phoenixes,\nfoxes and hares do not nurse horses.\nWater does not flow upward in flames,\nfire does not moisten downward.\n\nLead white is refined from black lead; when cast into fire, it reverts to lead. Snow and frost form from water qi; when warmed by broth, they return to water. Gold sand and mercury are of one body—gold serves as the mother, giving birth to cinnabar and mercury. Thus it is said: plant millet to grow millet, hatch chickens with their own eggs. Once they receive sufficient qi, they become millet and chickens. This is the Dao of kind begetting kind, of beginning and end naturally following one another.\n\nTo use metals, minerals, herbs, frost, dew, ice, snow, salt, or brine would be a grievous error—this has been thoroughly explained in the annotations above. In the twenty-fifth chapter of this scroll, the root of Heaven and Earth is taken as the root of the elixir, and true gold mother as the mother of the elixir. Now it produces yin-yang essence, golden cinnabar, and numinous mercury as the medicine of immortality—is this not so?\n\nThus it is said: swallows and sparrows do not give birth to phoenixes, foxes and hares do not nurse horses. Fire’s nature is to flame upward—it cannot be made to moisten downward. Water’s nature is to moisten downward—it cannot be made to flame upward. Since this is the root of their natural natures, by analogy, the gold mother producing golden cinnabar is self-evident.\n\n**The World Abounds with Scholars (Chapter Thirty-Four)**\n\nThe world abounds with scholars,\nmen of lofty skill and rare talent.\nYet by chance they meet no opportunity,\nwasting fire and squandering wealth.\nThey cling to texts and follow words,\nrecklessly imposing their own ideas.\nThe thread of origin loses its reason,\nmeasure and grasp slip from their hold.\n\nRefining malachite and chalcanthite, mica and reputed magnetite,\nsulphur burning in camphorwood, mud and mercury smelted in flight.\nBellows forge the five-stone bronze, using it as the pivot’s aid.\nYet their natures differ in kind—how could they dwell as one body?\nA thousand attempts must fail ten thousand times; seeking transmutation, one becomes a fool.\nFortune never favors them—only the sage truly knows.\nFrom youth to white-haired age, midway they breed doubt,\nabandoning the Dao to cling to deluded paths, stepping from the straight into crooked byways.\nPeering through a tube, their vision is not broad—how can they fathom what lies ahead?\n\nMaster Wei says: The world teems with broadly learned, erudite scholars who fix their minds on the realm of the Dao, fond of fiery pursuit of the Mystery. By chance, they fail to meet an enlightened teacher, relying only on texts and secret formulas, recklessly imposing their own ideas. They waste their wealth, refining miscellaneous medicines, hoping for transcendence and eternal life. Through the years to hoary age, they persist without turning back, stubbornly clinging to their narrow view, straying into false paths. A thousand attempts, ten thousand failures—how can they gauge the future? Their natures differ in kind; this was already explained in the annotation above.\n\n**Of the Utmost Sages (Chapter Thirty-Five)**\n\nOf the utmost sages, none surpass Fuxi,\nwho first drew the Eight Trigrams, modeling Heaven and Earth.\nKing Wen, imperial ancestor, structured the hexagrams and composed their judgments.\nConfucius, the near-sage hero, supplemented them with the *Ten Wings*.\nThese three lords were Heaven’s chosen, rising in succession to govern their times.\nThough their ranks differ in steps, their merits and virtues do not diverge.\nTheir creations followed precedent, weighing and measuring with meticulous care.\nWhat has form is easily reckoned; what lacks omen is hard to plan.\nTheir deeds became models for all, their works established the *Odes* and *Documents*.\nDevoid of prior knowledge, they awakened through their teachers.\nBright as if parting the curtains, they opened their eyes to ascend the high terrace.\n\nMaster Wei extols Fuxi, King Wen, and Confucius—the three sages Heaven-endowed with divine intelligence, each possessing luminous virtue. In expounding the *Dao* of the *Yijing*, they penetrated the essence of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things. In editing the *Odes* and *Documents*, they distilled the teachings of rulers, ministers, and the multitudes. They further established hexagram images, analyzed weights and measures, and calculated the cycles of celestial bodies, exhausting the numbers of the *Great Expansion*.\nThough Heaven and Earth are vast, they cannot seal the mechanisms of closure and openness.\nThough yin and yang are utterly void, they conceal the reckoning of movement and stillness.\nThus the sages drew upon them to devise the great Dao, using qian and kun to symbolize the cauldron and chamber, causing them to embrace the One qi and govern the ten thousand spirits, threading yin and yang through the hours, enabling the six voids to generate all beings.\nWhat has form is easily reckoned—Heaven and Earth.\nWhat lacks omen is hard to plan—yin and yang.\nWithout the three sages’ exposition of the *Yijing*, by what path would water and fire be deployed?\nWithout the legacy of their writings for ten thousand generations, by what gate would dragon and tiger be harnessed?\nThus it is said: Devoid of prior knowledge, they awakened through this.\nAs if parting the curtains, clarity dawned.\nAs if ascending the high terrace, nothing remained beyond their ken.\nThis metaphor illustrates the sages’ Dao: the higher one looks, the loftier it becomes; the deeper one delves, the more impenetrable it grows.\nThrough the *Dao* of the *Yijing*, the *Fire Records* are further illuminated—this will be briefly explained below.\n\n**The Fire Records’ Six Hundred Chapters (Chapter Thirty-Six)**\n\nThe *Fire Records* comprise six hundred chapters, their aims not differing in essence.\nTheir texts expound with solemn care, yet the world does not ponder deeply.\nTracing their source and flow, the hidden and manifest originally dwell as one.\nI speak in confidence to the worthy—how dare I treat this lightly in writing?\nIf I were to seal my tongue and wither, cutting off the Dao, I would incur guilt and punishment.\nYet to express my thoughts on bamboo and silk, I fear revealing Heaven’s tally.\nHesitant, I sigh in lament, gazing up and down, appending this folly.\nRefinement and cooling follow method and measure—I cannot bear to lay them all bare.\nI shall briefly outline their guiding principles; their branches and twigs will be seen in due course.\n\n**Six Hundred Chapters (Continued)**\n\nThe *Fire Records*’ six hundred chapters represent the grand reckoning of fire’s cyclical movement under the stars, each dawn and dusk governed by a hexagram’s charge. Though termed six hundred chapters, their sequence remains uniform—thus the year aligns with the month, the month with the day, the day with the hour. Master Wei dared neither seal his tongue to obscure the great Dao nor commit it openly to bamboo and silk, lest he reveal Heaven’s mechanism. Hesitant and sighing, he feared his words might fail posterity. Thus, he briefly sketched their guiding principles, hinting at their branches, while reserving finer details for oral transmission.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven: Using Metal as a Dike**\n\nUse metal as a dike, and water enters in leisurely flow.\nMetal’s reckoning is fifteen; water’s count matches it.\nBefore the furnace, fix the weights—water exceeds by five parts.\nWhen these two are deemed true, metal’s weight returns to its origin.\nThe third does not enter; fire and the other two accompany it.\nThe three substances unite, their transformations wondrous as spirits.\nBeneath lies the qi of Grand Yang, steaming in but a moment.\nFirst it liquefies, then congeals—this is called the Yellow Chariot.\nAs years and months near their end, nature is undone, lifespan harmed.\nThe body becomes ash and dust, its form like dust on a bright window.\n\nThe Metal Mother resides in the central palace, serving as a dike for quicksilver. Thus, metal and water flow in harmony, their natures entwined. Metal and water follow the celestial stems, each receiving half the qi, together making a full catty’s measure. Having produced golden cinnabar, the mother remains undiminished—hence it is said, “metal’s weight returns to its origin.” The third that does not enter is true earth. Metal, fire, and wood—these three substances, driven by water and fire through the celestial stems, enter the vessel together. There, the three natures converge, the two flavors bind, and their transformations become wondrous as spirits.\n\nThe Metal Mother, steamed by the essence and qi of Grand Yang, first exudes liquid, then solidifies—this is named the Yellow Chariot. Through the cycles of stars, yin and yang, and the Five Phases, their functions are tested and interwoven. Retreating to conceal their forms, all merit returns to the central palace. The Yellow Emperor embodies the power of earth—thus it is said, “nature is undone, lifespan harmed.” Returning to earth’s power, they transform into earth, their spirit and essence resembling dust on a bright window.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Eight: Pounding, Refining, and Combining**\n\nPound and refine them together, then hold them to enter the Crimson Gate.\nSeal their junctures firmly, ensuring perfection and strength.\nBlazing fire rises from below, its roar ceaseless day and night.\nBegin with civil fire, refine it; end with martial fire, array it.\nObserve with utmost care, scrutinizing the balance of cold and warmth.\nCycle through the twelve nodes; when each ends, renew your vigilance.\nWhen qi wanes and life nears its end, rest to revive the hun and po.\nThe color shifts to purple, resplendent—returned cinnabar is formed.\nKnead it into a single pellet; the spatula’s touch is most divine.\n\nPound and refine the elixir’s foundation, fortifying and sealing it, then place it within the crucible—this is called the Crimson Gate. Water flows downward, fire blazes upward; waxing and waning advance and retreat, ascending and descending by day and night. Civil fire begins at midnight, martial fire follows until noon. From noon, the yin tally arises, continuing to midnight. Their movements alternate between closure and opening, regulated by cold and warmth. When the twelve nodes conclude, the cycle renews. Once the fire’s course is complete, the hun and po transform their forms. Turning to purple gold, resplendent cinnabar is achieved. Ingesting a single grain, the spatula’s touch becomes divine. The marvel of this work defies full description.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine: Calculating the Numbers of the Five Phases**\n\nCalculate the numbers of the Five Phases—they are concise, not cumbersome.\nRaise water to strike fire, and its light is suddenly extinguished.\nSun and moon press close, ever between waxing and waning.\nWhen water prevails, Kan encroaches on yang; when fire weakens, Li’s day darkens.\nYin and yang consume each other, their intercourse the Dao’s natural course.\n\nThe Five Phases are the qi of emptiness and nothingness, elusive and hard to name. If measured by the total reckoning of Heaven and Earth, their workings elude capture, yet within the crucible, the Five Phases bind themselves. Yin and yang mate, fire rises as water recedes, water excites fire’s decline. The sun’s essence stirs at dawn’s waning, the moon’s po concludes at dusk’s end. Male and female alternate, cinnabar and mercury engender one another. By Heaven and Earth’s nature, the Dao of the elixir is revealed.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Forty: Names Define Essence**\n\nNames define essence; graphs express the nature of words.\nWhen metal returns to its original nature, it is called Returned Cinnabar.\nI dare not speak falsely, emulating the sages’ texts.\nAncient records praise Dragon and Tiger; the Yellow Emperor extolled Golden Flower.\nHuainan refined Autumn Stone; Wang Yang added Yellow Sprout.\nThe worthy may uphold and practice this; the unworthy must not partake.\nThe Dao of past and present remains one—face-to-face, we speak of what is planned.\nScholars, redouble your efforts, lingering in deep reflection.\nThe essential words are plainly revealed, shining bright—they do not deceive me.\n\nMetal is essence; water is nature. Since metal gives birth to quicksilver, essence returns to nature. Moreover, metal is born of water, making water the mother of metal. Water, in turn, is born of metal, so metal becomes the mother of water—hence the name Returned Cinnabar. As stated earlier, “the mother conceals the child’s embryo, the child shelters the mother’s womb.” In the twenty-fourth chapter of this scroll, it is said...\n\nYet the Master Wei’s confusion bequeathed a legacy of emptiness and deceit, as he invoked the imagery of the *Book of Changes* and the *Ancient Dragon-Tiger Classic* to expound his teachings, further extolling the Yellow Emperor, Huainan, Wang Yang, and the Perfected Sages—all of whom could uphold and practice this Way. The path of past and present shares a single gateway, unattainable to the unworthy. Thus, I urge later scholars to ponder deeply, for the essential words are plainly revealed, shining bright—they do not deceive me.\n\n*This concludes the first scroll of* The Unitary Meaning of the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, Divided into Chapters.\n\n#63 \"Each\" (*ge*) appears as \"awakening\" (*jue*) in the *Siku* edition.\n#64 \"Glaring eyes\" (*chēn mù*) appears as \"closed eyes\" (*míng mù*) in the *Siku* edition.\n#65 \"Analyzing by grains\" (*xī fēn zhū*)—the character *xī* (\"analyze\") is written as *chāi* (\"dissect\") in the *Siku* edition.\n#66 The character *yǐ* (\"with\") is supplied according to the *Siku* edition.\n#67 The character *dào* (\"Dao/Way\") is supplied according to the *Siku* edition.\n#68 \"Fear\" (*kǒng*) was originally written as *fú* (\"tally\"), amended according to the *Siku* edition.\n#69 \"Celestial tally\" (*tiān fú*) appears as \"celestial mechanism\" (*tiān jī*) in the *Siku* edition.\n#70 \"Stitching this folly\" (*zhuì sī yú*) appears as \"stitching these concerns\" (*zhuì sī lǜ*) in the *Siku* edition.\n#71 \"Morning and evening\" (*zhāo mù*) appears as \"morning *zhūn* and evening *méng*\" (*zhāo zhūn mù méng*) in the *Siku* edition.\n#72 \"Mutually receiving\" (*xiāng hé shòu*) appears as \"mutually containing and receiving\" (*xiāng hán shòu*) in the *Siku* edition.\n#73 \"Form\" (*zhuàng*) was originally written as *zhuàng* (\"robust\"), amended according to the *Siku* edition.\n#74 \"Yellow chariot\" (*huáng yú*) appears as \"Yellow Ascent\" (*huáng jǔ*) in the *Siku* edition.

Court Audience, Acting Minister of the Bureau of Sacrifices, Bestowed Purple Gold Fish Bag\n\nChapter Forty-One: The Firmness of Qian and Softness of Kun\nThe firmness of Qian and the softness of Kun #1 unite in mutual embrace.\n\nThe yang bestows and the yin receives; the male and female depend on each other.\nThrough this, creation and transformation unfold, and essence and qi expand.\nKan and Li crown the head, their radiance spreading far and wide.\nThe profound and obscure #2 are difficult to fathom, impossible to depict in diagrams.\nThe sage measures and weighs, arranging them in order without foundation #3.\nThe four merge into chaos, directly entering the void of non-being.\nThe sixty hexagrams cycle through, stretched out to form a chariot.\nThe dragon-horse is harnessed, and the enlightened ruler steers the times.\nWhen harmony prevails, all follow; the path is level and not crooked.\nCrooked ways are perilous and obstructed, toppling and endangering the state.\nThe firmness of Qian and the softness of Kun unite in mutual embrace.\n\nIn refining the golden liquid and returning elixir, first establish the Qian-Kun cauldron of *jiji* (\"already accomplished\"),\nthen cause yin and yang to merge essence and qi within it.\nNext, circulate the water and fire of Kan and Li, then unite the sun and moon, dragon and tiger.\nThus, radiance arises within the cauldron, its profound obscurity beyond scrutiny.\nThis truly stems from measuring and weighing the sagely patterns, thoroughly investigating the mother of the medicine,\nenabling Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li to blend and correspond.\nDescending and ascending #4 through the six voids, spreading and unfolding the five qi,\nfollowing the sixty hexagrams, traversing the twelve celestial stems,\narranged as a chariot to welcome the dragon-horse.\nWithin, the Golden Mother of the Central Palace, like a ruler governing the state and steering the times,\nemploys harmonious qi to follow, entrusting non-action to achieve great compliance.\nThus, the path is level and not sloped, with no going that does not return.\nIf, however, the fire is mismanaged or the timing misjudged,\nthe path becomes perilous and obstructed, and the state is seen to topple,\ncausing the Golden Consort of the divine chamber to lose her foundation for nurturing and producing.\n\nNow, the essentials of the golden elixir lie entirely in the two words: lead and fire.\nLead and fire are water and fire, the ancestral source of return and reversal.\nThe remaining five phases and qi cycles all serve as auxiliaries to achieve success.\nThe Golden Consort is the mother.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Two: The Noble One Dwells in His Chamber**\nWhen the noble one dwells in his chamber and utters good words, they resonate even a thousand *li* away.\nThis refers to the lord of ten thousand chariots, dwelling in the nine-fold chamber,\nissuing decrees and commands #5 in accord with the rhythms of yin and yang.\nConcealing the vessel and awaiting the time #6, do not violate the hexagram’s month.\n*Tun* uses *zi* and *shen*; *Meng* employs #7 *yin* and *xu*.\nThe remaining sixty hexagrams each have their own days.\nThe *Yi* states: \"When the noble one dwells in his chamber and utters good words, they resonate even a thousand *li* away.\"\nThis illustrates the Golden Elder dwelling in the divine chamber, like a ruler enthroned above the nine-fold palace.\nWhenever circulating the water and fire of dawn and dusk, it is like issuing decrees and commands,\ndesiring that all qi find their proper place.\nYet one must remain tranquil and non-active, concealing the vessel and awaiting the time,\nfollowing the line texts, adhering to the clepsydra’s marks, and examining each in turn.\nThe *Tun* and *Meng* symbols of dawn and dusk signify that the sixty hexagrams correspond to a month’s cycle,\nwith day and night each receiving one hexagram, cycling endlessly.\n*Yin* and *shen* are the positions where yin and yang begin and end.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Three: Briefly Setting Forth the Two Images**\nBriefly setting forth the two images, yet unable to exhaust their depths.\n\nEstablishing principles and enacting punishments, virtue is bestowed with benevolence.\nThose who defy them meet misfortune; those who follow them meet fortune.\nIn accordance with the calendar’s decrees, one must be sincere, focused, and precise.\nCarefully observe the celestial stems and branches, scrutinizing the waxing and waning.\nEven the slightest deviation brings regret and harm.\nBriefly setting forth the two images refers to water and fire, yin and yang.\nFrom *zi* to *si* belongs to spring and summer, the phase of fire’s movement and generation.\nWithin the vessel, it harmonizes to warm and nourish the spirit-essence,\nthus symbolizing the bestowal of benevolent virtue.\nFrom *wu* to *hai* belongs to autumn and winter, the phase of stern and withering forces.\nDescending into the embryo, it congeals and unites the numinous mercury,\nthus symbolizing the establishment of penal statutes.\nMaster Wei enables later generations to understand:\nthe movements of the sun and moon, the measured division of yin and yang’s rise and decline,\nfollowing the hexagrams and lines, aligning with cold and heat.\nHe imparts warnings of single-minded diligence,\nmonitoring the ebb and flow, ensuring that\nregret and harm do not arise within the crucible,\nnor thieves stir within the symbolic process.\nThen the cinnabar essence descends as qi,\nwhite mercury takes form,\nand the golden liquid’s return to elixir is achieved in no time.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Four: The Two Solstices Alter Their Measures**\nThe two solstices alter their measures, diverging and twisting in complexity.\n\nAmid deep winter, scorching heat arises; in midsummer, frost and snow descend.\nThe two equinoxes deviate, misaligned by even a moment’s measure.\nWinds and rains fall out of season, floods and droughts contend in turn.\nLocusts surge like boiling waters, strange omens proliferate on all sides.\nHeaven displays its portents: mountains collapse, the earth splits open.\nThe filial son’s concentrated mind moves the August Ultimate.\nWhat issues from his own mouth spreads near and far, flowing even to distant lands.\nSome bring calamity, some summon fortune;\nsome usher in great peace, some provoke war and upheaval.\nThese four outcomes arise from the heart’s depths.\n\nThe summer solstice, winter solstice, spring equinox, and autumn equinox—\nthese four correspond to *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* within the twelve earthly branches,\nmarking the boundaries of the four seasons.\nMoreover, the virtue of earth traverses the ends of the four seasons,\ngiving rise to the forms of dragon and tiger, metal and wood.\nNot merely a single phase within the four seasons,\nit further divides the twelve earthly branches into twenty-four qi\nand seventy-two seasonal indicators, mirroring the yearly qi-count.\n\nShould the finest hairs or slightest moments of the clepsydra fall out of step,\nthe sun and moon lose their measure by inches and feet.\n\nShould slight deviations skew the balance, day and night grow unequal;\nwhen the yang fire exceeds its measure, drought and flood fall out of harmony,\nand midwinter transforms into scorching heat;\nwhen the yin tally loses its rhythm, cold and warmth encroach upon each other,\nand midsummer reverts to thick frost.\nIn the metal palace, cinnabar and mercury fail to sprout—\nwithin the crucible, worms and moths arise instead.\nOn a grand scale, mountains collapse and earth splits asunder,\nwhile the metal tiger and wood dragon seethe and surge;\non a minor scale, violent rains and whirling winds arise,\nas the Kan man and Li woman flee in chaos.\nThe metal tiger and wood dragon are the ethereal souls of west and east;\nthe Kan man and Li woman are the husband and wife of north and south.\nWhen filial offspring scatter, the true mercury within the womb,\noverheated by misjudged fire-timing, takes flight without restraint,\nuntil at the mouth of the Supreme Polarity crucible,\nit bursts forth into distant realms.\nWhether fortune or misfortune, rise or fall—\nthese four outcomes and the transformations above\nall stem from the heart’s depths of those who tend the fire.\nIf one can align with the celestial mechanism, weigh the sun and moon,\nattend with meticulous care to harmonize the balance,\nand move the diagram with utmost sincerity—\n\nSummon harmonious qi within the crucible to produce the essence of Qian,\nand enable the true sovereign to reside in the womb, giving birth to the purity of Kun—\nthis is called \"true mercury.\"\n\n**Chapter Forty-Five: Constancy in Movement and Stillness**\nMovement and stillness follow constancy, adhering to their guiding line.\nThe four seasons proceed in due order, aligning with the qi’s flow.\nHard and soft are distinctly divided, never encroaching upon each other.\nThe five phases hold their boundaries, neither recklessly expanding nor contracting.\nThe *Yi* circulates in ceaseless flux, bending and stretching in endless return.\n\nIn all operations of water and fire, movement and stillness must accord with the seasons,\nso that the two qi of dragon and tiger mutually attend,\nmother and child cherish their bond,\nthe five phases guard their domains,\nand the four seasons cycle without cease.\nWhen fullness and contraction suffer no loss,\nand reversal and return know no error,\nthen one may witness the fruition of the work in a single day.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Six: Between the Dark and New Moons**\nBetween the dark and new moons, the tally moves in accord.\nKun and Meng stir in unison, as the female and male follow one another.\nNourishing fluids moisten and enrich, fostering transformation and flow.\nThe numinous brightness of Heaven and Earth cannot be measured.\nEmploy them to secure the body, and hidden arts may be mastered.\n\nBeginning in the northeast, the region of Jidu and Dou,\none may rotate rightward, as the wheel spews forth its sprouts.\nIn the hidden depths, images appear, and the light of essence scatters abroad.\n\nBetween the dark and new moons lies the juncture where metal and water tally,\nthe interval after Gen and before Yin.\nAs the yang tally retreats, metal and water share a common origin,\nthus the primordial chaos aligns, the female and male unite,\nand flowing qi moistens and nourishes, infusing the mother’s womb.\nThe numinous transformations thus born cannot be measured.\nYet one may secure the body and employ them,\nconcealing substance and hiding form,\nsubmerging the body in the hidden depths,\nuntil the light of essence gradually emerges.\nTurning rightward from the northeast,\nthis marks the renewal at the new moon,\narising from Jidu and Dou,\nrotating toward the western position,\nas the wheel spews forth its sprouts,\nand the mind begins to stir with the desire to leap forth.\nThough still in the time of hidden yin,\nit prepares to restore its former fullness.\nThus, in the northeast, the region of Gen,\nit follows the position of generation and completion,\nonce more stirring the hidden dragon.\n\nThis analogy describes the tally’s passage through Xu and Hai,\nwhen within the crucible, metal and water,\nhaving passed through the dark and new moons,\ndraw near to the Zi tally’s arising.\nThe Gen position is not far from Yin,\nhence it is said: \"the wheel spews forth its sprouts.\"\nWhen the metal mother meets the dark and new moons,\nmetal and water flow smoothly,\nand at the month’s dawn, upon encountering the Zi tally’s single yang fire,\nmetal, meeting fire, shines anew with doubled brightness.\nThus, rotating leftward, it spews forth sprouts,\ngradually forming the dragon’s body.\nHence the following text speaks of gradual decline and transformation,\nultimately returning to its origin.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Seven: Above Mao and Bi**\nAbove Mao and Bi, Zhen emerges as the standard.\nYang qi begins its inception, as the first nine is the hidden dragon.\nYang is established in threes, yin penetrates

unite with nature, they turn and join together.\n\nAt the culmination of Xu and Bi,\nZhen emerges as the expeditionary force—\nthis refers to the moon’s first appearance above Xu and Bi in the west,\nadvancing with the yang fire.\nBy the hours of Zi and Chou, it begins the circulation of qi in five-day cycles,\nfrom which a single yang line is reborn,\nand the qi of Zhen first stirs,\nthe inception of generation within the crucible.\nThus yang qi gradually arises.\nAfter three times five, totaling fifteen days,\npure Qian is complete, and the Dragon’s form is perfected.\n\nYang is established through three:\nfor three days the fire moves, and the yang qi first spreads within the crucible—\nhence it is said that on the third day Zhen stirs.\nYin flows through eight:\nafter two pentads, two yang lines are born,\nand by the eighth day,\nDui metal comes into use.\nMetal and water qi balance, marking the first quarter—\nmetal and water intermingle,\nso it is said that on the eighth day Dui moves.\n\nThe second nine, \"the dragon appears,\"\ninitially level and luminous—\nthis refers to the moon at first quarter, its form half-complete,\nan analogy for the crucible’s metal and water,\nreceiving the talismans of Yin and Mao,\nyin and yang each occupying half.\nThe perfection of the three fives—\nthis refers to the third nine, Qian unceasing,\nadvancing to Chen and Si,\nprecisely three pentads, totaling fifteen days.\nThree lines become pure yang,\nand the body of Qian is perfected.\nThereafter yin and yang divide,\nhence it is said that \"sformation proceeds gradually, ultimately returning to the origin,\"\ncompleting the cycle anew.\n\nXun continues the yin lineage;\nthe fourth nine may leap, but retreat risks peril—\nas the yang line retreats and transforms into one line,\nXun thus receives and carries the yin talisman.\nMoving for five days above Wu and Wei,\nthe yielding line gradually advances,\nyin qi begins to regenerate,\nenveloping and securing the yang essence,\ndaring not move or flee.\nAfter four pentads are fulfilled,\ntwo yin lines are born.\nGen moves through five pentads,\nthe talisman reaching Shen and You,\nencountering the last quarter on the twenty-third day—\nmetal and water balance once more.\n\nThe fifth nine, \"the flying dragon,\"\nrejoices in its celestial position—\nthis refers to the sixth pentad, thirty days,\nKun moving the yin talisman to Xu and Hai,\nwhere the qi of Qian and Kun are both complete.\nDragon and tiger, yin and yang,\nthe numbers of the myriad things revolve—\nhence it is said that the fifth nine rejoices.\n\nThe sixth five, Kun’s reception,\nbinds and completes the beginning and end.\n[ ] nourishes the many offspring, becoming the mother of all kinds—\nthis refers to Kun first transforming one line into yang to form Zhen,\nbecoming Qian’s eldest son;\nproceeding to three lines,\nall become pure yang to form Qian.\nAt the yang’s extremity, yin is born,\nreturning to Qian’s body,\ntransforming one line into yin to form Xun,\nbecoming Kun’s eldest daughter;\nproceeding to three lines,\nall become pure yin to form Kun.\nFrom beginning to end, emergence and submergence,\nall arise from Kun’s body nurturing the myriad things,\never the mother of all kinds.\nThe many offspring are the many hexagrams.\nThus the sixth five, Kun’s reception,\nbinds and completes the cyclical elixir’s beginning and end,\nserving as the Dao’s compass.\n\n\"Using the nine, it soars lightly\"—\nthis refers to the excess reaching its limit and yielding its position,\nfor the yang numbers are exhausted,\nthen turning to join together.\n\nFollowing the Jade Armillary, Chapter Forty-Eight\nFollowing the jade armillary,\nascending and descending, rising and falling.\nCirculating through the six lines,\ndifficult to perceive.\nThus it has no fixed position,\nserving as the *Yijing*’s ancestral source.\nThe preceding text speaks of Qian and Kun as the Dao’s compass—\nto follow the principles of yin and yang,\none must trace the Dipper’s movement.\nTransformation is complete within the six lines,\ncirculating without fixed position—\nthis is the ancestral source of the *Yijing*’s Way.\nIt is an analogy for Kan and Li moving qi within the crucible,\ncirculating through the six voids within the image,\neluding perception,\nmysteriously and subtly arising—\nthis is the ancestral source of the medicine.\n\nFirst Dawn as *Fu*, Chapter Forty-Nine\nAt first dawn, *Fu*—\nyang qi begins to flow.\nEntering and exiting without haste,\nestablishing the marker of subtle firmness.\nYellow Bell establishes Zi,\nthe omen thus manifest.\nDisseminating gentle warmth,\nthe common people find constancy.\n\nAt First Dawn as *Fu*—\nfive yin, one yang:\nyin qi reaches its extreme,\nyang qi revives.\nThis speaks of the six yielding lines in the lower body,\nwhere the first transforms into a firm line—\nthe omen of yang’s arising.\nThus, the yang fire begins at the onset of Zi.\n\nYang qi first flows,\nresonating with Yellow Bell.\nWithin the crucible, it receives the subtle yang qi,\nlaying the foundation for cinnabar and mercury.\nFive yin, one yang—\nwith yang as the master,\nqi spreads and circulates,\nreaching everywhere without obstruction.\nThis is what is meant by \"entering and exiting without haste.\"\n\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*Fu* is the return of the Way,\nthe revelation of Heaven and Earth’s heart.\nIt is an analogy for the crucible of Heaven and Earth,\nwhere the generation of the ten thousand things begins here,\ncorresponding to the eleventh month, Zi,\nthe time to advance the yang fire.\n\nBefore the Crucible, Applying the Kindling, Chapter Fifty\n*Lin*—\nbefore the crucible, applying the kindling,\nthe path opens, the light aligns.\nRadiance gradually advances,\nday by day, it grows longer.\nGreat Frame in Chou:\nthe structure takes form, high and low.\n\nThe *Lin* hexagram has four yin and two yang,\nan analogy for applying the Chou fire.\nYang’s power gradually advances,\nilluminating the crucible.\nAfter the winter solstice,\nthe days lengthen,\nyang qi spreads,\ngiving rise to the spirit’s essence.\n\nResonating with Great Frame,\nthe structure takes form, high and low—\nmetal and water respond to qi,\ngradually congealing flowing pearls above and below.\nThis corresponds to the twelfth month, Chou,\nthe time to advance the yang fire.\n\nLooking Up to Complete *Tai*, Chapter Fifty-One\nLooking up to complete *Tai*—\nfirm and yielding flourish together,\nyin and yang unite.\nThe small departs, the great arrives.\nConverging in Yin,\nmoving in accord with the season.\n\nThe *Tai* hexagram has three yin and three yang,\nyin and yang qi balance,\nhusband and wife unite.\nGradually, the essence of dragon and tiger appears,\ngold and mercury flourish.\nThus it is said: \"The small departs, the great arrives.\"\n\nThe *Yijing* says:\nNo level ground is without slope,\nno going forth is without return.\nThis is the Way of yin and yang’s succession,\ncorresponding to the first month, Yin,\nthe time to advance the yang fire.\n\nProgressing Through *Dazhuang*, Chapter Fifty-Two\nProgressing through *Dazhuang*—\nflanking the gate of Mao.\n\nThe Elm Pods Fall, Returning to Their Root\nElm pods fall and scatter,\nreturning to their root.\nPunishment and virtue bear each other,\nday and night begin their division.\n\nThe *Dazhuang* hexagram has two yin and four yang,\nspeaking of mid-spring when yang qi, though flourishing,\nstill harbors yin within yang.\nYin’s path is about to depart,\nso the elm pods follow yin and fall.\n\n\"Punishment and virtue bear each other\" refers to the second and eighth months,\nthe times when yin and yang divide their positions.\nYang is virtue, and by virtue all things live;\nyin is punishment, and by punishment all things die.\nThus in the second month, yang contains yin,\nand yin qi encroaches upon things,\nso that in mid-spring the elm pods fall—\nan image of golden sand following the remnant yin qi,\nmoving and settling within the womb,\nhence it is called \"returning to the root.\"\nIn the eighth month, yin contains yang,\nand yang qi stirs to life,\nso that in mid-autumn shepherd’s purse and wheat sprout anew—\nan image of metal and water following the remnant yang qi,\nfilling the chamber with nourishing essence,\nhence it is called \"renewed flourishing.\"\nThe following section on the *Guan* hexagram speaks of this.\nAt the juncture where punishment and virtue bear each other,\nthe time when yin and yang balance,\nit corresponds to the second month, Mao,\nthe time to restrain the tally.\n\nResolving Yin to Retreat, Chapter Fifty-Three\nResolving yin to retreat,\nyang ascends and advances.\nWashing and cleansing the wings,\nshaking off the dust of the old roost.\n\nThe *Guai* hexagram has one yin and five yang,\nyang ascends and yin retreats.\nYang qi is already abundant,\nyet within the crucible remains a trace of yin qi,\nswept away by the fire of Chen.\nGolden sand is thus washed and cleansed of its wings,\nshaking off the dust of the old roost.\nIt corresponds to the third month, Chen,\nthe time to advance the yang fire.\n\nVigorous Strength and Radiant Clarity, Chapter Fifty-Four\nVigorous in strength and radiant in clarity,\nits brilliance spreads to the four neighbors.\nYang culminates in Si,\nbalanced and interacting within.\n\nThe *Yijing* says: \"Great indeed is the primal power of *Qian*!\"\nFirm, strong, centered, and upright,\npure and refined essence.\nThe primal power of *Qian* is the source from which all things draw their beginning.\nFrom the winter solstice, when the first yang is born,\nto the time of pure yang,\nclouds drift and rain falls,\nall things take form.\nThis is likened to the crucible’s receipt of the tally from the eleventh month to the fourth,\nwhen the six lines transform into pure *Qian*,\nnurturing the myriad forms to completion.\nThus the golden embryo meets the fire of true yang,\nand metal, refined by fire, becomes a vessel,\nshining with ever-increasing brilliance,\nspreading its light to the four neighbors,\nfilling the crucible chamber.\nIt corresponds to the fourth month, Si,\nthe time to advance the yang fire.\n\n\"Balanced and interacting within\" refers to yang at its peak giving rise to yin,\nspeaking of the following section where yin encroaches upon yang’s virtue.\n\nThe Beginning of Sequence in *Gou*, Chapter Fifty-Five\nThe beginning of sequence in *Gou*—\ntreading frost comes first.\nThe cold spring at the well’s bottom,\nWu is *Ruibin*.\nThe guest submits to yin,\nyin becomes the host.\n\nThe *Yijing* says: \"*Gou* means encounter.\"\nFive yang and one yin,\nyin arises and yang retreats,\nyin and yang divide their boundaries,\ndragon and tiger mate,\nhence they encounter.\nIt also says: \"Bound to the golden restraint, steadfast and auspicious.\"\nThis speaks of the first yin leading the change,\nbound to what follows,\nuntil extreme yin is reached.\n\"Treading frost comes first\" means the first yin arises,\nforging the path to extreme yin;\nonce there is a trace of frost,\nthe lines proceed to solid ice.\n\n\"The cold spring at the well’s bottom\" refers to five yang below and one yin,\nyin qi not yet spread and stretched.\nThough the five yang are many,\nyin is now taking charge.\nAmong the six lines of the hexagram,\nfive yin and one yang take yang as the host;\nfive yang and one yin take yin as the host.\nThe many take the few as their host,\nhence it is said that yin is the host.\nThis is likened to the golden mother within the crucible,\nwhich is originally the essence of supreme yin water.\nAt first receiving the subtle sign of yin qi,\nthe metal-water gains a slight release of its nature,\nyet still foresees the coming of solid ice and extreme yin.\nIt corresponds to the fifth month, Wu,\nthe time to retreat the yin tally.\n\nWithdrawing from the World and Abandoning Position, Chapter Fifty-Six\nWithdrawing from the world and abandoning position,\ngathering in one’s essence.\nEmbracing virtue and awaiting the season,\nits handle lingers in darkness and obscurity.\n\nThe *Dun* hexagram has four yang and two yin,\nyin qi gradually flourishing,\nyang qi gradually waning.\nThis speaks of yang relinquishing its position,\ngathering in its true essence,\nawaiting what is to come.\nThe remnant yang dwells in yin,\ngradually nearing extinction,\nhence its handle lingers in darkness and obscurity.\nThe *Yijing* says: \"No thing can forever flee,\"\nhence one awaits the season.\nThis is likened to the true essence of the red dragon within the crucible,\nsubjected to yin’s dominion,\ngradually uniting with metal-water,\nabout to give rise to the maiden mercury.\nThus it gathers in its true essence,\nentrusting itself to the transformations of yin and yang.\nIt corresponds to the sixth month, Wei,\nthe time to retreat the yin tally.\n\nObstruction and Blockage, Chapter Fifty-Seven\nObstruction and blockage,\nwhat sprouts does not grow.\nYin extends and yang yields,\nyang’s name and form vanish.\n\nThe *Pi* hexagram has three yang and three yin,\nheaven and earth both at rest,\nyin and yang do not interact,\nthe myriad things do not sprout.\nThe golden mother within the central palace,\ncoiling and uncoiling in tranquil ease.\nIt corresponds to the seventh month, Shen,\nthe time to retreat the yin tally.\n\nObserving Its Measure, Chapter Fifty-Eight\nObserving its measure,\nexamining the nature of mid-autumn.\nEntrusting the nurturing of the tender and young,\nthe old and withered flourish anew.\nShepherd’s purse and wheat sprout,\nburgeoning forth from beneath the cover.\n\nThe *Guan* hexagram has two yang and four yin,\nyin qi already flourishing,\ncomparable to the nature of mid-autumn.\nThis speaks of metal within the crucible,\nreceiving yin qi and uniting with water,\ntransforming and giving rise to the maiden mercury.\nYet yin qi, though in command,\nstill leaves a remnant of harmonious yang within the crucible,\nso that in mid-autumn shepherd’s purse and wheat sprout anew,\nhence it is said that the old and withered flourish again.\n\"Burgeoning forth\" means growing everywhere.\nThis is likened to metal-water receiving the yin tally in mid-autumn,\nnurturing and rearing the numinous mercury,\nfilling the womb.\nThe second and eighth months,\nwhen yin and yang’s punishment and virtue bear each other,\nwere already explained in the annotation to the *Dazhuang* hexagram above.\nIt corresponds to the eighth month, You,\nthe time to restrain the tally.\n\nPeeling Away and Decaying the Body, Chapter Fifty-Nine\nPeeling away and decaying the body,\ndissolving and vanishing its form.\nTransformative qi is exhausted,\nthe utmost spirit is lost.\n\nThe *Yijing* says: \"*Bo* means to peel.\"\n\nOne yang amidst five yins—yin flourishes while yang wanes,\nthe soft encroaches until the hard is spent.\nMetal and water both rest,\nthe limbs dissolve and vanish,\ntheir merit returned to the virtue of earth.\nThis corresponds to the ninth month, Xu,\nthe time to withdraw the yin tally.\n\n\"Losing the utmost spirit\" refers to the six lines below, all yin.\n\n**When the Dao Reaches Its Limit, It Reverts, Chapter Sixty**\nWhen the Dao reaches its limit, it reverts,\nreturning to the *Primordial* of *Kun*.\nEver compliant with earth’s patterns,\nit receives heaven’s mandate and spreads forth.\n\n*Qian* begins with *Kun*:\nsix yielding yin lines,\nbeneath the ninefold earth,\none firm line transforms—\nthis is called \"the birth of one yang.\"\nFrom this yang qi begins,\nadvancing through six changes to pure yang,\nand the body of *Qian* is complete.\nWhen pure yang qi is full,\nyang at its extreme gives rise to yin.\nBeneath the six firm yang lines of *Qian*,\none yielding line transforms—\nthis is called \"the birth of one yin.\"\nThrough six changes to pure yin,\nit returns once more to the body of *Kun*.\nThus it is said: when the Dao reaches its limit, it reverts,\nreturning to the *Primordial* of *Kun*.\n\n*Kun* is earth, mother, yin.\n*Qian* is heaven, father, yang.\nYin attains yang and gives birth;\nyang attains yin and achieves completion.\nThis is what is meant by \"one yin, one yang—this is the Dao.\"\nIt bends to shape the myriad things without omission.\nThus it is said: ever compliant with earth’s patterns,\nit receives heaven’s mandate and spreads forth.\n\nThis is likened to the twelve months of the year,\nthe twelve hours of the day,\nthe advancing and retreating fire tally of yin and yang,\nthe essential qi of *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* cycling endlessly.\nIts wondrous workings are inexhaustible,\nenabling the divine maiden and numinous youth\nto join yin and yang within the sacred chamber,\nthe soaring dragon and crouching tiger\nto unite hun and po within the mother’s womb.\nThus the spirit transforms without bound,\ngiving birth to the purely refined.\n\n**The Profound and Fathomless, Chapter Sixty-One**\nProfound, secluded, distant, and boundless,\nseparated yet interconnected.\nResponding to measure, nurturing life—\nthe origin of yin and yang.\nVast and indistinct,\nnone know its beginning.\nFirst lost in confusion,\nlater becoming the sovereign lord.\nNo level ground without slope—\nsuch is the Dao’s nature.\nChange and renewal wax strong,\nwaxing and waning follow one another.\n\nFrom *Kun*’s end to *Fu*’s beginning,\nlike tracing a linked ring.\nEmperors and kings inherit and serve—\nenduring for a thousand generations.\n\nThough heaven and earth are profound and distant,\nwhen the qi of sun and moon intersect,\nthey respond to their celestial measures,\ninterconnecting to nurture the seeds of the myriad things,\nbecoming the ancestors of yin and yang.\nYin and yang unite their essence\nwithin the vast and indistinct expanse of heaven and earth—\nnone know whence they emerge or vanish.\n\nThis is likened to the crucible’s symbolic form:\n*Qian* and *Kun* as father and mother,\nrevolving the axes of *Kan* and *Li*,\nmale and female within the crucible.\nWithin the vast and indistinct,\nnone perceive the traces of their transformations.\n\nGold, as the root of the elixir within the vessel,\nfirst appears undifferentiated as dark and yellow,\nlost in confusion without track or path.\nNext, yin and yang divide;\nfinally, the sovereign lord—\nthe five phases interact without cease,\nadversity and prosperity alternate,\nwaxing and waning follow one another.\nFrom *Fu*’s beginning to *Kun*’s end,\nfrom new moon to dark moon,\nentering the tally and issuing fire,\naugmenting water and stabilizing metal,\nadvancing fire and halting water—\nthe principle resembles a cycle.\nThe inner image of metal and water nurturing life\nis like the ruler:\nwhen the tally’s fire is applied without missing the season,\nthe dragon and tiger endure for a thousand autumns.\n\n**Cultivating Nature, Chapter Sixty-Two**\nTo cultivate nature,\nextend life and delay death.\nExamine the end with care,\nand first consider its beginning.\n\nThe body one examines\nis fundamentally empty.\nPrimal essence spreads like clouds,\nborne by qi at the outset.\n\nMaster Wei said: Those in the world who wish to extend life and delay death\nmust understand the body’s beginning and end.\nBeginning and end—\nthis is the primordial qi.\nThis is likened to the completion of the returning elixir,\nwhich arises entirely from primordial qi,\ncontinuing the boundless primordial qi\nto sustain the limited bodily form.\n\nBoundless primordial qi\nis the long-lived true essence of heaven and earth,\nthe qi of the sacred father and numinous mother.\nThe limited bodily form\nis the short-lived, turbid, and chaotic qi\nof ordinary parents.\nThus, with the qi of the true parents,\none transforms the body of ordinary parents\ninto a form of pure yang and true essence,\nthereby attaining the same lifespan as heaven and earth.\n\nMaster Tao said: Primordial qi is humanity’s root.\nThe *Ancient Song* says:\nRefine it, ingest it for a thousand days,\nand when the body is free of yin, how can death come?\nThus, the pure yang essence and qi\ncannot decay or perish.\n\n**Yin and Yang as Measure, Chapter Sixty-Three**\nYin and yang serve as measure,\nthe dwelling of hun and po.\nYang spirit is the sun’s hun,\nyin spirit is the moon’s po.\nHun and po,\neach makes the other its dwelling.\n\nNature presides within,\nestablishing the inner and outer barriers.\nEmotion governs without,\nbuilding walls and outer ramparts.\nWhen walls and ramparts are complete,\npeople and things find peace.\nAt this time,\nemotion harmonizes with *Qian* and *Kun*.\n\n*Qian* moves and extends,\nits qi spreading, its essence flowing.\n*Kun* is still and receptive,\nbecoming the Dao’s abode.\nThe firm acts and retreats,\nthe soft transforms and nourishes.\nNine returns, seven reversals,\neight returns, six resides.\n\nThe white male, the red female—\nmetal and fire restrain each other.\nWater settles fire,\nthe beginning of the five phases.\nSupreme goodness is like water,\nclear and without flaw.\nThe Dao’s form and image—\ntrue unity is hard to depict.\nThough it changes and spreads forth,\neach dwells in its own place.\n\nThe regulation of yin and yang is this: in refining the Golden Liquor Returning Elixir, one must first determine the movements of yin and yang, then establish the *Qian* and *Kun* cauldron and furnace. The dwelling of *hun* and *po*—each serving as the other’s chamber—refers to the solar *hun* and lunar *po* mutually restraining each other within the golden chamber, forming the foundation of the elixir.\n\nNature presides within, establishing the inner and outer barriers, for nature belongs to metal. Metal governs the inner principle, receiving and stabilizing external signs to nurture the numinous mercury. The barriers and ramparts are the physical form. Emotion governs without, building walls and outer ramparts, for emotion is the fire of the talisman. Fire moves through the six voids, becoming cinnabar mercury and the city walls. The people are the cinnabar mercury. At this time, it is also through the movement and stillness of *Qian* and *Kun*, the flowing of qi and spreading of essence, that earth resides in the central palace, becoming the Dao’s abode. Yang submits, yin acts; prosperity comes as adversity departs. The punishment and virtue of yin and yang form the fundamental path of the medicine.\n\nNine returns, seven reversals, eight returns, six resides: this refers to metal’s generating number being four and its completing number nine; fire’s generating number being two and its completing number seven; wood’s generating number being three and its completing number eight; water’s generating number being one and its completing number six; earth’s generating number being five and its completing number ten.\n\nThe white male and the red female: metal initially arises from water and belongs to yin, associated with the northern *Kan* trigram, the male within the *Qian* household, thus called the *Kan* male, metal white. Hence, the male is white. Fire belongs to yang, associated with the southern *Li* trigram, the female within the *Kun* household, thus called the *Li* female, fire red. Hence, the female is red. Moreover, when metal is within the cauldron, it is the male, the husband of the *Li* female; when outside the cauldron, it reverses to become the female, the wife of the *Kan* male. Thus, the metal mother receives the qi of the Great Yang and produces the numinous mercury.\n\nRestraint settles water: this means metal and fire restrain each other, preventing the true water from flowing away. Water is the beginning of the five phases, for water’s generating number is one. Supreme goodness is like water: water is the mother of the myriad things, clear and without flaw, invisible to the eye. The Dao’s form and image: it operates subtly within the cauldron, transforming endlessly, impossible to depict. Transforming and spreading forth: this means the five phases each guard their boundaries, and the fire talisman does not err in the four seasons.\n\nAs in the sixty-fourth chapter, \"Like a Chicken’s Egg\":\nLike a chicken’s egg, white and black correspond.\nA span of one inch, the beginning.\nFour limbs and five viscera, sinews and bones complete.\nAfter ten months, it emerges from its womb.\nBones soft and pliable, flesh smooth as lead.\n\nIn refining the Golden Liquor Returning Elixir, there is an altar; upon the altar, a furnace; within the furnace, lightning; within the lightning, a cauldron; within the cauldron, a divine chamber; and within the divine chamber, golden water. The divine chamber resembles a chicken’s egg, as does the golden water. \"Like a chicken’s egg\" describes the layers enfolding one another. \"White and black correspond\" means gold and water envelop each other. \"A span of one inch\" refers to the placement of the numinous mercury. If the *Qian* and *Kun* pivot is employed, with *Kan* and *Li* generating and completing, after ten months the form is complete, no different from a human—four limbs, five viscera, bones, and flesh all whole.\n\nThese several lines reveal Master Wei’s disclosure of the inner and outer symbolic forms, the shape and appearance of cinnabar mercury. Lord Yin the True’s *\"Song of the Divine Chamber\"* says:\nThe earthen golden cauldron, seven spans in life and death.\nThe divine chamber, threefold bright, five inches in diameter.\nChaotic and wandering, heaven and earth, the five stars,\nYin and yang conjoined.\nResembling a chicken’s egg, the form without flaw.\nYellow and white, outer and inner, evenly thick and thin.\nSealed with six and one, guard well the noon gate.\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* also states: \"With water, the mother controls the earth.\" \"Flesh smooth as lead\": cinnabar arises from lead to symbolize the mother. Master Cao’s song says:\nA hundred moments reach the *Li* qi,\nFrom which cinnabar emerges.\nIts body like true pearls,\nThough cinnabar is not originally red.\nThis clarifies its form resembling true pearls, its flesh smooth like lead.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Five: The Burning Mirror Gathers Fire**\nWith the burning mirror, fire is gathered;\nwithout the sun, no light is born.\nWithout the moon and stars, the square vessel\ncannot yield water and broth.\nThe two qi are profound and distant,\nyet their resonance and transformation still communicate.\nHow much more so when near, stored within the body,\nclose to the heart and chest.\n\nYin and yang pair with the sun and moon;\nwater and fire serve as proof.\nIf the burning mirror and square vessel, moved by qi, can still generate water and fire, how could *Qian* and *Kun*, the sun and moon, set in place as symbols, fail to generate and complete? Moreover, when near, drawing from the body, and when far, drawing from things—first delving into the mother of heaven and earth to lay the foundation of the elixir, finally uniting the essence of the sun and moon to serve as the ancestor of the medicine—with kinds producing one another, water and fire restraining each other, how could there be no evidence of efficacy?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Six: The Three Treasures of Ear, Eye, and Mouth**\nThe three treasures—ear, eye, and mouth—\nfirmly sealed, do not let them scatter.\nThe true person hides in the deep abyss,\nfloating and wandering, guarding the compass’s center.\nTurning and curving to see and hear,\nopening and closing, all in harmony.\nAs the pivot for oneself,\nmovement and stillness never exhausted.\n\nThe *Li* qi inwardly defends and protects;\nthe *Kan* does not employ hearing.\nThe *Dui* joins without speech,\nfew words follow the primordial chaos.\nOnce these three are secured,\nrelax the body in an empty chamber.\nEntrust the will to emptiness and nothingness,\ntaking no-thought as the constant.\n\nProof is difficult to shift;\nthe heart is focused, not scattered.\nIn sleep, spirit and soul embrace;\nin waking, watch for life and death.\nThe complexion gradually moistens,\nthe bones and joints grow stronger.\nExpelling the host of yin demons,\nonly then is the true yang established.\n\nIf cultivation is unceasing,\nthe qi will ascend like clouds and rain.\nGentle as spring’s moisture,\nflowing like melting ice.\nFrom the head, it streams down to the feet,\nultimately rising again.\nComing and going through the boundless,\nfilling the space within.\n\nThe reversal is the proof of the Dao;\nweakness is the handle of virtue.\nWeed and hoe the long-accumulated filth,\nand even the subtle finds harmony.\nThe turbid is the path to clarity;\nprolonged darkness yields to brightness.\n\nThe *Yi* says: *Kan* is the ear, *Li* the eye, *Dui* the mouth.\n*Kan*, *Li*, and *Dui*—these are water, fire, and metal.\nLocking the water and fire, sealing the metal mother,\none calls the infant boy and compliant girl \"true persons,\"\nfloating within the womb,\nletting the metal mother relax her body in the empty vessel,\nwithout the stirrings of thought,\nto verify the natural generation of male and female.\nOnce yin and yang within the crucible\nrise and descend in harmonious balance,\nthe dragon and tiger within the womb\nembrace in ascent and descent,\nfirmly securing the true essence.\nThe complexion gradually moistens,\nthe bones and joints grow stronger.\nIf cultivation is unceasing,\nproof will come with time.\n\nDrawing out the yin fire\nis called expelling the yin demons;\nadding the yang tally\nis the proper arousal of yang’s movement—\nrevolving without end.\nThe spirit chamber settles into peace,\nclouds move and rain descends;\nmercury flows as golden liquid,\nlike melting ice.\nFrom the feet to the head,\nit suffuses the true person’s body,\ncirculating through the metal mother’s form.\nThe fire’s qi swells within the crucible,\nthe yin essence guards its weakness within the compass.\nProlonged darkness yields to light—\nthis is the moment when yin reaches its extreme and yang arises.\nWithin clarity, the turbid appears—\nthis is the time when fire departs and water returns.\nThe four seasons alternate,\nthe five phases mutually engage.\n\nReversal is the proof of attaining the Dao:\n*Kan* departs, *Li* arrives.\nWeakness is the foundation of cultivating virtue:\nyang extends, yin submits.\nThe *Kan* ear does not hear,\nso that the yin spirit may harmonize,\nand the true water does not flow away.\nThe *Li* eye does not see,\nso that the yang soul may warmly nurture the true mercury,\nand it does not escape.\nThe *Dui* mouth does not speak,\nsealing the metal womb,\nso that it does not open and leak the red dragon’s essence.\n\nThe four chapters of *True契* that Master Wei puzzled over\nestablish their words and metaphors—\nall are drawn from afar but applied nearby,\nmatters manifest yet words subtle.\nTheir intent is neither to openly reveal heaven’s mechanism\nnor to conceal the supreme Dao.\nThus, they fully clarify here\nhow inner imagery and outer practice coincide.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Seven: The World Prefers Petty Techniques**\nThe world prefers petty techniques,\nfailing to examine the Dao’s depth.\n\nThose who abandon the true Way to follow deviant paths\nseek swift passage through gates that will not open.\nLike the blind refusing a staff,\nor the deaf straining to hear gong and shang notes—\nthey plunge into water to seize pheasants and hares,\nor climb mountains in search of fish and dragons.\nThey plant wheat hoping to harvest millet,\nor spin compasses to seek squares.\nExhausting their strength and laboring their spirits,\nthroughout the year they see no achievement.\n\nTo know the method of ingesting the elixir:\nits affairs are few yet not cumbersome.\nMaster Wei observed that the world favors learning petty arts,\nrushing toward shortcuts.\nYet these petty arts and swift paths\nhave beginnings but no ends.\nThough one may expend great effort,\nfew ever attain completion—\nlike the blind and deaf groping in seeing and hearing,\nor hunters and fishers erring amid mountains and rivers.\nSince their choices and rejections are misaligned,\nhow can they rightly distinguish truth from falsehood?\n\nI urge the pursuit of the supreme Dao:\nfew in affairs yet not cumbersome.\nMoreover, the Golden Liquor and Returned Cinnabar\nare the supreme Way of soaring into the heavens by daylight.\nIf one encounters an enlightened master,\nor receives divine instruction,\nand follows its wondrous formulas in cultivation,\nthen the principle of *ease and simplicity* is attained.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Eight: The Radiant Sun’s Flowing Pearl**\n\nThe radiant sun’s flowing pearl\never seeks to depart from man.\nSuddenly obtaining the golden blossom,\nit turns and intermingles.\nTransformed into white liquor,\nit congeals to utmost firmness.\nThe golden blossom first intones;\nafter a brief interval,\nit dissolves and transforms into water,\nits horse-teeth lattice arrayed.\nYang then goes forth to harmonize,\ntheir natures and dispositions spontaneous.\nWhen yin presses urgently upon the time,\nit is confined within the gate of restraint.\nThe compassionate mother nurtures and rears;\nthe filial son repays the kindness.\nThe stern father issues commands,\ninstructing and admonishing descendants.\nThe Five Phases intermingle as kings,\neach relying on the other to generate.\nFire’s nature melts metal;\nmetal fells the flourishing wood.\nThe Three and Five with the One—\nthe celestial and terrestrial utmost essence.\nThis may be transmitted orally,\nbut is difficult to convey in writing.\n\nThe \"flowing pearl of the Grand Yang\" arises when earthly qi responds to celestial qi, transforming into pearl-like dew—this is the pure essence of yang, capable of generating the myriad things. Though it possesses qi, it lacks form, hence it is called the \"Crimson Dragon.\" The yang fire transforms qi into cinnabar, thus fire gives birth to earth, and earth gives birth to metal. Metal is the mysterious essence of the Grand Yin, capable of nurturing the myriad things. Though it possesses qi, it also has substance, hence it is called the \"Golden Blossom.\"\n\nThe Crimson Dragon is originally born of *jia* and *yi*, also named the \"Azure Dragon\"—yang, father, husband, fire. The Golden Blossom is provisionally born of *geng* and *xin*, also named the \"White Tiger\"—yin, mother, wife, water. Thus, the meanings of the Azure Dragon and White Tiger are as such. Yet if yin and yang are inverted, the Five Phases interchanged, and male and female roles reversed, their significance shifts accordingly. The *Song of the Perfected One of Grand White* states:\n\n*\"The art of inverting the Five Phases—\nthe Dragon emerges from within fire.\nThe Five Phases move not in sequence—\nthe Tiger is born within water.\"*\n\nThe root of reverted cinnabar and the ancestor of Dragon and Tiger: the Dragon is born of fire, the Tiger arises from water. These words are immutable. The metal wife first intones, the wood husband scatters and bestows. The divine mother conceives, giving birth to the *chunü*. As the *chunü* gradually matures, her transformations are manifold. Sometimes she dissolves into water, sometimes her horse-teeth lattice appears. Though the metal mother originates from water, amid her transformations, the watery essence never ceases.\n\n\"Yang then goes forth to harmonize, their natures and dispositions spontaneous\" refers to the mutual generation of metal and mercury. \"When yin presses urgently upon the time, it is confined within the gate of restraint\" describes the succession of yin qi, which aids in protecting the inner palace. \"The compassionate mother nurtures and rears; the filial son repays the kindness\"—the compassionate mother is the inner embryo, while the filial son is true mercury. The *Song of the Perfected Yin Lord* states: \"True yang is cinnabar, true yin is mercury.\" Since mercury is born of the metal mother, this is called repaying kindness. Their mutual embrace and swallowing signify the intermingling qi of Dragon and Tiger.\n\n\"The stern father issues commands, instructing and admonishing descendants\"—*Qian* is the father trigram, which instructs all trigrams to assist the *Li* maiden and *Kan* youth, and the Five Phases together generate the mercury and cinnabar descendants. In reverted cinnabar, lead and fire are the ancestral principles, employed from beginning to end. The remaining qi, temporal markers, and auxiliary signs serve to establish the foundation of the spirit. Beyond this lies not the Way of the Golden Liquor Reverted Cinnabar.\n\nFire can melt metal, yet fire is born of wood, and metal in turn restrains wood—thus fire, metal, and wood reverse their constraints to flourish. An ancient song states:\n\n*\"Cinnabar is the essence of wood,\nonly when united with metal do they merge.\"*\n\nAnother verse says:\n\n*\"Once the Three Natures unite,\nthe Two Flavors naturally bind.\nThe embryo is firmly sealed, no leakage—\ntransformation occurs in an instant.\"*\n\nThe Three Natures are fire, metal, and wood. The Two Flavors are lead and mercury, Dragon and Tiger. Thus it is said: \"The Three and Five with the One— the celestial and terrestrial utmost essence.\" This may be transmitted orally, but is difficult to convey in writing—how could it be lightly discussed with the unworthy?\n\nThe annotation states: \"Reversing male and female\" refers to divine water restraining fire; yet within the divine chamber, fire in turn restrains metal. Thus mercury is the water within cinnabar, and metal is the cinnabar within water. Cinnabar gives birth to mercury, and metal gives birth to water.\n\n**You should turn right at *zi*, while *wu* rotates eastward. *Mao* and *you* form the boundary, establishing the two names of host and guest. The Dragon calls to the Tiger, the Tiger inhales the Dragon’s essence. Both devour each other, each coveting the other’s advantage. Thus they interlock and swallow, chewing and consuming one another. When *Yinghuo* guards the west, the *Grand Peace* traverses the heavens. Wherever the killing qi descends, what could remain unshaken? The cat guards the mouse, the sparrow fears the goshawk. Each fulfills its function—how dare any make a sound?**\n\nTurning right at *zi* reaches *you*; rotating east at *wu* arrives at *mao*. These twelve earthly branches mark the cyclical return of yin and yang, corresponding to the fire phases. The *mao-you* boundary signifies the equilibrium of metal and wood qi. The two names of host and guest are the designations of metal and wood. Since the Azure Dragon can exhale qi, the White Tiger thereby inhales its essence. Their essences intermingle, together generating purity.\n\n*Yinghuo* is the extreme yang fire number. \"Guarding the west\" means the fire qi presses upon the metal embryo. When metal receives the full brilliance of fire, its radiance fills the vessel. The metal qi, borne by fire, traverses the heavens—thus it is said: \"Wherever the killing qi descends, what could remain unshaken?\" Then the *chunü* and true mercury dare not flee, like a cat seizing a mouse or a sparrow fearing the goshawk.\n\n*Grand White* is the essence of metal. \"Traversing the heavens\" refers to *jia* and *yi*.\n\nThe metals, fires, and woods alternately restrain and subdue one another, yet none suffers harm, each attaining its fulfillment—thus all sounds are harmonious.\n\n**Chapter Seventy: Failing to Grasp the Principle**\nFailing to grasp the principle, one ought not speak recklessly.\nExhausting the family’s wealth, wife and children suffer hunger and poverty.\nFrom ancient times to the present, countless millions have pursued this path,\nYet few meet with success, rare are those who achieve it.\nSeeking famous medicines far and wide, they stray from the Dao.\nIf one truly encounters the Way and perceives its beginnings,\nThen by analogy one may weigh the nature of things and their endings.\nMaster Wei said: In refining the golden liquor and returning elixir, without grasping the principle, one must not act rashly.\nWasting family wealth, one further burdens wife and children;\nFrom ancient times to the present, those who have loved the Dao number in the millions,\nYet without meeting an enlightened teacher or encountering true instructions, they ultimately fail.\nIf one receives transmission, discerns its signs, and cultivates by analogy, then success will crown the beginning and end.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-One: The Five Phases Restraining One Another**\nThe five phases restrain one another, alternating as father and mother.\nThe mother contains the nourishing essence, the father bestows and endows.\nCondensing essence and flowing form, metals and stones do not decay.\nBy careful focus and non-dissipation, one attains the fruition of the Dao.\nErect a pole and see its shadow; call into a valley and hear its echo—\nIs this not wondrous? The supreme image of heaven and earth.\nYet if one takes a single inch of wild aconite or an ounce of croton, swallowing it brings instant collapse, leaving one unable to rise or bow.\nAt such a time, though King Wen cast yarrow stalks, Confucius interpreted omens,\nBian Que wielded his needles, or Wu Xian beat his drum,\nHow could they revive the stricken or restore them to swift movement?\nThe five phases generate and restrain one another, alternating as father and mother, mutually serving as husband and wife.\nParents observe one another and give birth; yin and yang depend on each other to stand, together forming the indestructible elixir.\nShould one obtain this, one ought to guard it with utmost care to fulfill the Dao.\nThus, a pole cast upright yields an instant shadow, an empty valley returns an echo.\nIf even wild aconite, once ingested, produces immediate effects,\nHow much more so the golden liquor and returning elixir?\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Two: The Maiden of the River’s Edge**\nThe maiden of the river’s edge is numinous and most divine.\nWhen she meets fire, she takes flight, leaving no trace of dust.\nGhosts conceal her, dragons hide her—none know where she abides.\nShould one seek to restrain her, the yellow sprout must serve as root.\nThe maiden of the river’s edge is true mercury.\nWhen she encounters fire, she soars away, like a ghost concealed or a dragon submerged—none know her whereabouts.\nIf one intends to restrain her, one must obtain the yellow sprout as her mother to nurture and sustain her.\nThe yellow sprout is true lead.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Three: Things Lacking Yin and Yang**\nThings lacking yin and yang defy heaven and contravene the primal.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Three (continued): The Hen’s Egg**\nThe hen’s own egg—its chick is never whole.\nWhy is this so?\nThe union was not yet in motion, the Three and Five unjoined, hardness and softness sundered.\nThe essence of transformation, heaven and earth’s spontaneity—\nlike fire stirring to flame upward, water flowing to moisten downward.\nNo master’s Way compels them thus.\nThe origin governs all governance; it cannot be altered again.\nObserve the male and female in their mating:\nhardness and softness entwine, inseparable.\nWhen their rhythm aligns, no craft or artifice governs them.\nThe boy is born prone, the girl supine.\nThey receive their allotment in the womb, their qi from the primal beginning.\nNot only at birth is this manifest—\neven in death, they repeat it.\nNot by parents’ teaching do they thus behave;\nthe pattern was fixed in mating, determined at the very first.\nThe *Book of Changes* says: “One yin, one yang—this is called the Dao.”\nBetween heaven and earth, were yin and yang sundered, the myriad things would cease to be.\nLone yin, solitary yang—neither can generate or complete.\nThus, if the divine medicine’s workings lack the Three and Five in motion, if metal and wood do not unite, how can the elixir form?\nFire flames upward, water moistens downward—all is the nature of spontaneity.\nWhen they unite in cultivation, their numinous essence arises of itself.\nEach receives the qi of the primal beginning, and their natures are thus fixed.\nFor instance: the boy is born prone, and so he lies in death;\nthe girl is born supine, and so she lies in death.\nThus, from the mating of male and female, the true essence is perpetuated.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Four: The Kan Male as Moon**\nThe Kan male is the moon, the Li female the sun.\nThe sun bestows its power, the moon unfurls its light.\nThe moon receives the sun’s transformation, its body unharmed.\nWhen yang loses its bond, yin encroaches upon its brightness.\nAt dark and new moon, they press close, eclipsing one another.\nYang’s form is consumed, yin’s encroachment brings calamity.\nMale and female depend on each other, inhaling and exhaling to nurture.\nMale and female intermingle, seeking their kind.\nThe moon’s essence is golden cinnabar; the sun’s spirit is fiery mercury.\nIf the sun retreats, the moon assumes authority.\nMetal and fire alternate in their work, restraining one another—nothing is harmed.\nBetween dark and new moon lies the moment of yin and yang’s succession,\nthe time of the sun and moon’s waxing and waning.\nThus, when they press close and eclipse, their forms are consumed.\nThis illustrates the crucible’s inner yin tally and yang fire,\nexchanging with each passing moment, from dusk to dawn,\nshifting with the hours, replacing one another.\nWhere they overlap, calamity is said to arise.\nWithin it, the Kan male and Li female remain:\nthe male’s passion, the female’s nature,\nmutually dependent, inhaling and exhaling,\ngathering by kind to generate and transform,\nrefining true essence into divine medicine.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Five: Metal Transforms into Water**\nMetal transforms into water, water’s nature circulating and manifest.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Five: Fire Transforms into Earth**\nFire transforms into earth, and water cannot flow.\nThus, the male moves outward to bestow, while the female remains still, inwardly storing.\nIf it overflows beyond measure, it is restrained by the female.\nThe po controls the hun,\npreventing excess or indulgence.\nNeither cold nor hot, advancing and retreating in due time,\neach attains harmony, together exhaling the verifying tally.\nWhen fire reaches the second and eighth months, metal and water stretch and flourish.\nSometimes watery essence arises from metal,\nsometimes golden cinnabar transforms into water—\nthus harmony blends and circulates.\nWhen fire’s reckoning is exhausted, its merit returns to earth.\nEarth guards the four seasons, damming water to prevent its flight—\nhence water cannot flow.\nThe male moves outward to bestow, so fire acts externally;\nthe female remains still, inwardly storing, so metal guards the central palace.\nThough fire’s qi encounters it,\nmetal is bound by water.\nWith yin po restrained, yang hun also submits.\nCold and warmth embrace, each finding its proper place.\nTogether exhaling the verifying tally, they nourish the numinous mercury.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Six: Cinnabar and Wood Essence**\nCinnabar and wood essence unite only when met with metal.\nWhere metal and water converge, wood and fire become companions.\nThe four intermingle in chaos, arrayed as dragon and tiger.\nThe dragon bears yang’s odd numbers, the tiger yin’s even.\nThe liver, green, is the father; the lungs, white, the mother.\nThe kidneys, black, are the child; the heart, red, the daughter.\nThe spleen, yellow, is the ancestor—\nthe child is the beginning of the Five Phases.\nThree substances form one household, all returning to wu and ji.\nThat cinnabar and wood essence unite only when met with metal:\ncinnabar is originally congealed within the metal’s womb.\nMetal, in turn, is water’s root.\nWhen metal is struck by fire, cinnabar is produced—\nthus cinnabar comes to merge with metal.\nMetal and wood transform themselves,\nwhile water and fire mutually refine.\nThe four intermingle, and within them take shape dragon and tiger.\nYin and yang’s odd and even numbers divide their ascent and descent by day and night.\nThe liver, green, is the father:\njia and yi belong to the fire clan, yet unite with the metal mother—\nhence it is named father.\nThe lungs, white, are the mother:\nthe metal mother guards the inner womb, ever taking fire as her husband—\nhence it is named mother.\nThe kidneys, black, are the child:\nthe metal mother is born from water,\nyet within the crucible, water in turn is born from metal—\nthus water becomes the child.\nThe child water’s number is one, the beginning of the Five Phases.\nMetal, water, and wood share a single function,\ntheir transformations spanning from start to finish,\nall returning to wu and ji—\ntherefore the spleen, yellow, is the medicine’s ancestor.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Seven: Hard and Soft Alternate in Ascendancy**\nHard and soft alternate in ascendancy, traversing their divided domains.\n\nThe Dragon lies west, the Tiger east—\nestablishing their weft at mao and you.\nPunishment and virtue converge in union,\ntheir meeting a joyous encounter.\nPunishment governs suppression and slaying;\nvirtue governs generation and ascent.\nIn the second month, the elm scatters its pods,\nas the *Kui* star presides over mao.\nIn the eighth month, wheat sprouts forth,\nwhile the Celestial Net holds fast to you.\nZi to the south, wu to the north—\neach serves as the other’s guiding principle.\nThe numbers one and nine,\nend and begin anew.\nThe Primordial Qi abides in *Xu* and *Wei*,\ndisseminating essence at zi.\nWater and fire alternate in ascendancy,\ntraversing their ordained paths,\ndistributed through the twelve celestial branches—\nDragon and Tiger, mao and you, mark their boundary.\nYin’s punishment brings suppression and slaying;\nyang’s virtue brings generation and ascent.\nWhen punishment and virtue meet,\neach restrains the other,\nyet together they achieve harmony—\nhence it is called a joyous encounter.\n\nThe elm scatters its pods in the second month,\nfor though yang fire advances from zi to mao,\nand yang qi gains sway,\nit has not yet reached pure yang—\nyin lingers within, making it yang containing yin.\nThus it suffers punishment and slaying:\nyin steals yang’s qi,\ncausing the elm’s pods to fall\nin the very month of mid-spring’s burgeoning.\nWheat sprouts in the eighth month,\nfor though yin’s tally retreats from wu to you,\nand yin qi gains sway,\nit has not yet reached pure yin—\nyang lingers within, making it yin containing yang.\nThus it receives virtue’s generation:\nyang steals yin’s qi,\ncausing wheat shoots to rise\nin the very month of mid-autumn’s withering.\n\nThis illustrates how, within the crucible,\nthe Metal Mother,\namidst the waxing and waning of yin and yang,\nsteals from one another—\nnow unfurling and enfolding true essence,\nnow shattering cinnabar and mercury.\nZi to the south embodies yin containing yang,\nthe image of the *Kan* man.\nWu to the north embodies yang containing yin,\nthe image of the *Li* woman.\nThe number one is yin;\nthe number nine is yang.\nYin and yang’s cyclical end and beginning\nserve as the medicine’s function.\nPrimordial Qi arises from *Xu* and *Wei*,\nwhile yang qi once more disseminates essence at zi,\ngiving birth to true numen.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Eight: The Osprey’s Cry**\nBy the river’s isle, the osprey cries—\n*guan guan*, the osprey cries.\n\nThe demure and graceful maiden—\na gentleman’s fine mate.\nThe male does not dwell alone;\nthe female does not live in solitude.\nBlack Warrior’s tortoise and serpent\ncoil and intertwine in mutual support.\nThus are male and female made clear,\neach ever in need of the other.\nWere two women to share a chamber,\ntheir beauty most fair,\nand should Su Qin convey their words,\nZhang Yi broker the match,\nunleashing eloquent tongues,\ndeploying honeyed speech,\nlaying bare their hearts in perfect accord,\nto wed as husband and wife—\nyet with hair decayed and teeth rotten,\nthey would never truly know one another.\nIf medicinal ingredients are not of the same kind,\ntheir names and categories disparate,\ntheir measures misaligned,\ntheir guiding principles lost—\nthough the Yellow Emperor himself tend the crucible,\nthe Great One wield the fire,\nthe Eight Lords pound and refine,\nHuainan blend and harmonize,\npavilions raised and altars erected,\nsteps and terraces prepared,\nunicorn jerky and phoenix cured meats laid out,\nregisters held in reverent kneel,\nprayers and invocations offered to gods and spirits,\npleas made to all ghosts,\nwith ablutions and fasting observed,\nhopes held high—\nit would be no different than mending a cauldron with glue,\nor plastering a wound with □,\nadding ice to dispel cold,\nor scalding water to relieve heat:\nflying turtles and dancing serpents,\nonly more perverse and wayward.\n\nAll who cultivate the Golden Liquor’s Returned Cinnabar\nmust first clarify the root of lead and fire,\nthen recognize the principles of yin and yang.\nSolitary yin does not generate of itself;\nlone yang does not achieve completion alone.\nOne must await the union of yin and yang,\nthe coupling of female and male,\nthe dragon’s exhalation and the tiger’s inhalation,\nthe male’s maturation and the female’s conception.\nThus it is said:\nA hen’s self-laid egg—\nits chick will not be whole.\nTwo women dwelling together—\ntheir bond will not be true.\n\nMoreover, between heaven and earth,\nwere yin and yang sundered,\nthe myriad things would cease to be.\nThus, to plumb the true essence of heaven and earth,\nto seize the root of yin and yang—\nthis becomes the foundation of the medicine.\nIf one were to use gold and stone, grasses and trees,\nice and snow, frost and dew, salt and brine—\nthings not of the same kind, alien categories,\nsolitary yin or lone yang—\nthough the Yellow Emperor tend the crucible,\nthe Great One wield the fire,\nthe Eight Lords pound and refine,\nHuainan blend and harmonize,\nelaborate altars and platforms erected,\nwine and viands lavishly prepared,\nreverent kneeling and solemn prayers offered,\npetitions made to all gods and ghosts—\nyet still hope for the Returned Cinnabar’s completion,\nit would be as futile as mending a cauldron with glue,\nor plastering a wound with □:\nflying turtles and dancing serpents,\nall in vain.\n\nThis analogy—\nwhen the sovereign and his ministers unite in harmony,\nlike the coupling of yin and yang,\nthey respond to one another as naturally as the five phases.\nGold and water, in their proper seasons and measures,\nprolong life within the chamber’s stillness.\nMoreover, true gold, as the first of the five phases,\nholds the fire tally.\nThere is a furnace, and upon the furnace—\nthe Perfected Lord of Yin’s crucible,\nseven inches long and one inch in diameter,\nas described in the *Cantong Qi*.\nThus, the circulation of qi and blood,\nthe gates and towers of the body,\nall are regulated.\nAbiding in an empty room,\nawakening to the truth,\nthe movement of the Way reverses all things.\nWithin the hollow vessel,\nits yin essence submerged in water,\none obtains the golden millet.\nThe method of ingestion is not cumbersome:\na single path suffices.\nMountains and rivers respond in kind,\ntheir patterns interlocking like latticework.\nYet if one clings to restraint or hoards in excess,\nor errs in the alternation of kingship,\nthe union will fail to manifest.\nThose that interlock and devour one another—\nfire, in its appointed role,\nthe Great Peace’s essence—\ntrue mercury arises from this.\nThose who truly follow the Dao,\nattaining the supreme image,\nseal the root and turn from the primal.\nThe hen that crows at dawn,\nbefore the cycle begins,\nmust be fixed in place.\nThus, the spirit and essence,\nthe bestowal of virtue,\nits bond with life—\nwater, though exhausted, does not take flight.\nWhen encountering the red heart as the feminine,\nreturning to form,\nthe tally aligns with the Way.\nYet when it resides within...\n\nWithin it, the reversal—\nthus water becomes the child.\nThe child-water,\nunified as one,\nheaven’s guiding net—\nthis analogy:\nits expansion and contraction,\nthe coiled serpent’s dance,\nits profound subtlety.\nHusband and wife,\nthe warp and weft of the celestial order,\nthe Supreme Unity,\nrefined through smelting.\nThe rooster,\ndwelling in harmony,\nwith wine and viands—\n\n*Zhouyi Cantong Qi Fenzhang Tongzhenyi*, Scroll the Lower\nAnnotated by Peng Xiao, Zhenyi Zi of Feihe Mountain, True One of the Flying Crane,\nGentleman for Court Audiences, Acting Minister of the Bureau of Sacrifices in the Ministry of Rites,\nBearer of the Purple Gold Fish Bag\n\n**Chapter the Seventy-Ninth: Only the Sages of Old**\n\nOnly the sages of old,\nembraced the Mysterious and held fast to the True.\nThey ingested and refined the Nine Cauldrons,\ntransforming their traces to conceal and merge.\nContaining essence and nurturing spirit,\nthey penetrated virtue through the Three Luminaries.\nTheir fluids suffused the pores,\ntheir sinews and bones attained firmness.\nAll perverse influences were dispelled,\nthe upright qi ever abided.\nAccumulating over long ages,\nthey altered their forms and became immortals.\n\nGrieving for later generations,\nthose who loved the Dao,\nthey followed the winds and gathered fragments,\nsketching ancient texts.\nThey composed diagrams and records,\nrevealing them to posterity.\nYet they exposed only the branches and twigs,\nhiding the root and trunk.\nThey entrusted them to stones and minerals,\nobscuring the multitude of writings.\nScholars who obtained them,\nlocked them in caskets for life.\nSons inherited their fathers’ work,\ngrandsons followed their ancestors’ paths.\nTransmitted through the ages in confusion,\nnone ever glimpsed the truth.\nThus officials abandoned office,\nfarmers neglected their plows,\nmerchants forsook their goods,\nand men of purpose fell into poverty.\n\nI sorrow deeply for this,\nand so set down this text.\nIts words are concise and easily pondered,\nits matters few and unburdened.\nI lay out its principles,\nverifying what may be observed.\nWeights and measures are numbered,\nfollowing one another in sequence.\nThus I compose these disordered verses,\nopening the gates and apertures.\nLet the wise reflect deeply,\nand apply their minds to this.\n\nMaster Wei said: The Three Sovereigns refined the divine elixir of the Nine Cauldrons and ingested it, attaining the containment of essence and nurturing of spirit, penetrating virtue through the Three Luminaries, transforming and merging their original forms, becoming immortals and guests of the Supreme Emperor. Grieving for later seekers of the Dao, some relied on fragmented ancient texts, others explored esoteric scriptures and formulas, revealing only the shallow and superficial, disclosing the branches while concealing the root, falsely attributing it to metals and stones, confounding the ancestral lineage and obscuring the true pattern. Later generations, obtaining these, failed to investigate the traces, taking the text at face value, mistaking the false for the true, locking them in caskets, passing them on in mutual delusion. Thus some squandered wealth and neglected their livelihoods, vainly harming their Daoist aspirations. Therefore, I have specifically set down this chapter, valuing its brevity and ease of reflection, its concision and lack of entanglement. I expose its essential truth, not merely offering disordered verses, hoping to awaken the unenlightened and directly discuss cinnabar and mercury. Let the wise study it thoroughly, and they will grasp its true meaning.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter the Eightieth: The Pattern of Heaven and Earth**\n\nNo pattern is greater than that of heaven and earth—\nthe Mysterious Gully spans ten thousand *li*.\nThe River Drum nears the Star Marker,\nand the people all tremble in alarm.\nThe shadow’s reckoning falsely advances and retreats,\nnine years of calamity befall.\nThe August Emperor gazes upon it,\nand the king retreats to reform himself.\nThe passes and barriers rise and fall,\nharmful qi scatters in flight.\nThe Yangtze and Huai run dry,\ntheir waters flowing into the sea.\n\nThe female and male of heaven and earth,\nrevolve between *zi* and *wu*.\n*Yin* at *shen* and *yang* at *yin*,\nemerging and entering, completing the cycle’s beginning.\nFollowing the Dipper’s sway and scattering,\ngrasping the balance to fix the primal order.\n\nThe Cauldron of Completion,\npatterns heaven and earth within its vessel—\nthe Mysterious Gully thus matches ten thousand *li*.\nThe three stars of the River Drum,\nwhen they near the Star Marker close to the Northern Dipper,\nportend military might,\nand so the people tremble in alarm.\nMoreover, the military is ruled by metal,\nwhich here signifies the metal within the cauldron,\nsubjected to the fire’s timing,\nfiercely pressed and scorched,\ncausing the metal to melt and the cauldron’s chamber to glow.\nThus drought and calamity arise,\ntruly due to the sundial’s and water-clock’s discrepancies,\nleading to the *yang* nine’s sand-like tribulations.\nYet by the August Emperor’s earthly virtue,\nmetal and water are restrained,\nthe scorching fire naturally subsides,\nand errors are corrected.\n\nIf the mechanisms are not secure,\nthe cauldron’s vessel leaks its tally,\nthen the primordial qi of the cosmic cycle\nrushes into the Yangtze and Huai,\nand the water tally flows away.\n*Yin* arises at *wu*,\n*yang* begins at *zi*,\ntheir movement and stillness revolving,\nnever departing these two positions.\n*Yin* at *shen* and *yang* at *yin*,\nwater and fire complete their cycles,\nall following the Dipper’s establishment to fix the balance and order.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter the Eighty-First: Ascending and Roasting on Mount Zeng**\n\nAscending and roasting on Mount Zeng,\nthe blazing fire spreads below.\nThe White Tiger sings and leads the way,\nthe Azure Fluid harmonizes behind.\nThe Vermilion Bird soars and plays,\nits flying radiance in five colors.\nIt encounters the net’s deployment,\npressed down, unable to rise.\nIts cries, mournful and sorrowful,\nlike an infant longing for its mother.\nOverturned and seized by the boiling grasp,\nits feathers and wings are crushed and broken.\nBefore half the water-clock’s measure has passed,\nfish scales and manes arise.\nFive colors dazzle and terrify,\ntransformations without constant master.\nThe cauldron seethes and surges,\nviolent and unceasing.\nLayer upon layer, piled and repeated,\nlike dog’s teeth interlocking.\nIts form like midwinter ice,\nrailing-like stalactites exude.\nTowering and jumbled, mixed together,\ncrossing and propping one another.\n\nThe cauldron rests upon the stove,\nthe furnace and altar connected,\nthus likened to Mount Zeng.\nAbove the cauldron, water; below, fire.\nThe White Tiger sings first,\nthe Metal Mother, receiving fire, takes form.\nSometimes it spits white sand,\nsometimes it generates azure fluid.\nThe Vermilion Bird of *bing*-*ding*,\ncirculating qi to and fro,\ndriving the Five Phases,\nthus forming five colors.\nThe Five Qi gather in the cauldron of *qian* and *kun*,\nthe four seasons follow the gates of water and fire.\nHeaven and earth’s barriers,\nthe net of *yin* and *yang*.\nThe Maiden is constrained,\ntrue mercury cannot escape.\nAt times, mournful cries arise,\nyet in the end, it clings fondly to its mother.\nThus its feathers and wings are crushed,\nwithin the womb, now mercury, now sand.\nWhen the fire tally of the water-clock is applied,\nwithin the embryo, now scales, now manes.\nTransformations without constant master,\nyet movement and stillness follow constant patterns.\nSometimes violently surging without cease,\nsometimes gushing and overflowing without end.\nWhen the vessel is solid, dog’s teeth interlock;\nwhen suspended in emptiness, stalactites hang like railings.\nLeaning and propping, towering and mixed,\nall reveal the transformations of metal and water,\nfully displaying the forms of cinnabar and mercury.\nSubtle and wondrous,\nmysterious and profound—\nthus Master Wei points to the manifestations of cinnabar and mercury.\n\n**Chapter Eighty-Two: Yin and Yang in Harmonious Union**\n\nYin and Yang in harmonious union,\nserene and tranquil, they guard each other.\nThe Azure Dragon dwells in Chamber Six,\nspring blossoms flourish in the East’s Mao.\nThe White Tiger resides in Pleiades Seven,\nautumn’s awns gleam in the West’s You.\nThe Vermilion Bird rests in Spread Two,\ntrue Yang blazes in the South’s Wu.\nThese three come to pay homage,\ntheir kin as intimate companions.\nTheir root lies in but two substances,\nyet in the end they become three and five.\nThree and five with the One,\nall gather and return to the Two.\nRefine them according to the prescribed method,\nand the days’ count is likewise observed.\n\nWhen Yin and Yang unite,\nthen Metal and Water, serene and tranquil, guard each other.\nThe Azure Dragon, White Tiger, and Vermilion Bird—\nthese are the three qi of Wood, Metal, and Fire.\nCirculating into the crucible,\nthey become intimate companions.\nYet the foundation of the elixir originally holds only Metal and Fire.\nThat they become three, five, and one—\nWood, Earth, and Water combine with the inner Metal and Fire,\ntogether completing the transformations.\nAll the days required for refinement and circulation\nhave been fully explained in the preceding chapters.\n\n**Chapter Eighty-Three: First White, Then Yellow**\n\nFirst white, then yellow,\nred and black emerge within and without.\nThis is called the First Crucible,\nits measure like a great grain of millet.\nIt is the work of Nature herself,\nno devious or false path.\nAs when mountains and marshes exhale their qi,\nsteaming clouds arise and become rain.\nMud dries and turns to dust,\nfire extinguished transforms into earth.\nLike the bark that dyes to yellow,\nor indigo that yields green silk.\nHide boiled into glue,\nyeast and sprouts fermented into wine.\nKindred substances readily yield their effects,\nbut disparate kinds defy artifice.\nThis wondrous art alone—\nexamine it closely, it speaks no falsehood.\nTransmitted to a hundred million ages hence,\nits brilliance remains self-evident.\nRadiant as the stars traversing the Han,\nluminous as the sea, source of all waters.\nPonder it deeply until it is mastered,\nturn it over and examine it above and below.\nAfter a thousand cycles, resplendent and flourishing,\nafter ten thousand repetitions, it may be witnessed.\nThe numinous may reveal itself to man,\nthe heart’s spirit suddenly awakens.\nTrace its beginnings, seek its threads,\nand you shall surely find its gate and door.\nThe Way of Heaven is ever impartial,\nyet it is always transmitted to the worthy.\n\nThe transformations of the inner embryo’s gold and water manifest thus: the initial white is the gold disgorging its jade-like fluid. The subsequent yellow is the fluid transmuting into the Yellow Sprout. The red and black suffusing its surface and core signify the qi of water and fire, yin and yang, penetrating and harmonizing the embryo’s vitality.\n\nThe Gold Fluid Returned Elixir, being the first crucible, is called the Golden Sand Yellow Sprout. As the *Ancient Text of the Dragon and Tiger Classic* states: \"The husk is the essence of gold, and water encircles the yellow fluid.\" Ingesting a single grain, no larger than a millet seed, when the three-year term is complete, one ascends to heaven in broad daylight. It further declares: \"Among all elixirs, this is the most numinous trace—none attain longevity without it.\"\n\nWithin the Daoist gate, there are twenty-four great elixirs, all originating from the first crucible, the Golden Sand Yellow Sprout. Those not beginning thus belong to the side doors of material medicines and do not rank among the Gold Fluid Returned Elixirs. Formerly, Li Quan annotated the *Yin Fu Jing*, saying: \"Though the arts of the Returned Elixir number in the hundreds, the essence lies in the Divine Water and Flowery Pond.\" The \"hundreds\" refer to the firing times—withdrawing and adding, warming and refining, the elixir forms in ninety days. Another ten days complete the firing cycle, totaling one hundred days.\n\nThe essence lies in the Divine Water and Flowery Pond, for the Golden Sand Yellow Sprout emerges therefrom. Without this, one cannot discuss the true path of the Gold Fluid Returned Elixir—it is like cleaving open primordial chaos to behold the root of heaven and earth, or rending the vast expanse to witness the mother of yin and yang. Yet when the divine mother resides within the crucible, enveloped by the qi of yin and yang, it is as clouds drifting and rain descending. Water and fire operate, each returning to earth, and the medicine within the embryo changes its color and form with the seasons, its appearance unfixed—like indigo and sprouts dyeing green and yellow, or hides and yeast becoming glue and wine, transforming according to their original kind.\n\nThus, the sages probed the root and foundation of heaven and earth to become the parents of the Returned Elixir, employing the five phases to generate the numinous medicine. This is not achieved through the five metals, eight stones, or miscellaneous substances. The principles expounded here are luminously verifiable, like stars traversing the Han or waters flowing to the sea. The patterns are complete, the symbols fully arrayed—how could Master Wei have deceived us? Yet one must read these texts ten thousand times for their meaning to become manifest; or, with divine aid and awakened spirit, suddenly perceive their gate and door.\n\nThe *Dao De Jing* states: \"Heaven and earth are impartial, yet they ever bestow upon the good.\" A note clarifies: Some Daoist texts claim the three chapters of the *Cantong Qi* were each composed by Master Wei, Xu the Attendant, and Chunyu Shutong—this is gravely mistaken. Here, the Master appends *The Five Phases in Mutual Resemblance*, stating: \"I now compile this to fill omissions.\" Thus, it is clearly the work of Master Wei alone. Moreover, during the Tang, the Perfected Liu Zhigu of Shu presented his *Discourse on the Mysterious Pivot of Sun and Moon* to Emperor Xuanzong, which also elaborates on this—how then can doubts remain about the annotations of the Attendant or the transmissions of Chunyu? Now, these four chapters are divided into three scrolls, comprising ninety sections, corresponding to the yang number nine.\n\n**Chapter 84: Filling Omissions**\nThe *Cantong Qi* broadly sets forth its principles, yet it cannot maintain purity, overflowing in its discourse. Subtleties remain unaddressed, and gaps abound. I now compile this to fill omissions, refining its profound depths and linking its threads. Its purport is unified, its aims uncontradicted. Thus, I compose this, titling it *The Five Phases in Mutual Resemblance*, wherein the essence and nature of the *Great Change* are fully revealed.\n\n**The Five Phases Attain Harmony, Each with Its Correspondence**\nMaster Wei first expounded the three chapters of the *Cantong Qi*, unfolding its vastness, yet subtleties remained unaddressed. He then composed this *Five Phases in Mutual Resemblance* to fill omissions, such that the essence and nature of Qian and Kun, yin and yang, the five phases, and the cycles of beginning and end are fully revealed. The patterns of the Returned Elixir, from inception to completion, are now complete.\n\n**Chapter 85: The Essence and Nature of the Great Change**\nThe essence and nature of the *Great Change* each adhere to their measure. The Yellow Emperor and Laozi thoroughly investigated and applied them, verifying their efficacy. The work of the furnace and fire is truly grounded: the three paths emerge from one, all following the same route. Thus, the rituals of elixir refinement each have their proper measure. The Yellow Emperor and Laozi delved deeply into the Dao, leaving these texts. Comparing the work of the furnace and fire, it is truly grounded—the five phases share a common origin, and the three paths of metal, wood, and fire all proceed from a single route.\n\n**Chapter 86: Branches, Stems, Flowers, and Leaves**\nBranches, stems, flowers, and leaves bear fruit in abundance, yet all depend on the root. Do not lose your original nature. The words spoken in sincerity are precise and without error. In refining the Gold Fluid Returned Elixir, one must first recognize the root to yield flourishing flowers and leaves and abundant fruit. \"Do not lose your original nature\" means not losing true mercury. Recognizing true lead as the root of the medicine naturally produces the fruit of true mercury. Trust that these words will not mislead later generations.\n\n**Chapter 87: Like the Midwinter Season**\nLike the midwinter season, bamboo and trees all wither and decay.\n\n**Assisting Yang to Question the Merchants**\n\nAssisting Yang to question the merchants—\nthe lord deeply conceals himself.\nAligning with the seasons and following the celestial cycles,\nhe seals his mouth and refrains from speech.\nThe Dao of Heaven is vast and boundless,\nthe Great Mystery defies description.\nVoid and still, it cannot be perceived;\nits frame and enclosure dissolve into nothingness.\nErrors and missteps disrupt the thread of affairs,\nand words return to wound the speaker.\nI distinguish these Four Images\nto enlighten later generations still in blindness.\n\nIn refining the elixir, the fire-timing may cause branches and stems to flourish,\nor fruits to ripen in abundance,\nor plants and trees to wither and fall—\nresponding to the midwinter season,\nopening and closing in accord with the time,\nall governed by the regulation of the fire’s rhythm.\n\n\"Assisting Yang to question the merchants\" signifies sealing the passes and restricting travel,\nsymbolizing the firm closure of the crucible,\npreventing the leakage of true essence and qi.\n\"The lord deeply conceals himself\" refers to the Golden Mother of the Central Palace.\n\"Sealing the mouth and refraining from speech\" denotes the Chamber of Dui Metal.\n\"The Dao of Heaven is vast and boundless\"—\nwithin the crucible, transformations are limitless.\n\"The Great Mystery defies description\"—\nthe fluids of metal and water are unfathomable,\ntheir subtle movements infinite,\ntheir divine transformations boundless.\nAs the four seasons shift,\nthe frame and enclosure dissolve,\nand the forms of metal and water undergo change.\n\nMaster Wei said: \"The Great Dao nurtures all,\nyet the True Governor has no form.\nWithout employing symbolic methods\nto harmonize yin and yang,\nrestrain and bind their hidden transformations,\nand align with the celestial mechanism,\nhow could one draw forth the essences of the sun and moon,\nretain them within the crucible’s confines,\nand achieve such wondrous transformation?\nIf errors disrupt the thread of affairs,\nfailure and harm are inevitable.\"\nThus, I set forth this text\nto awaken those of later times who have not yet seen the truth.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 88: The Rustic of Kuaiji**\n\nThe rustic of Kuaiji,\nrotting in a secluded valley,\nclings to simplicity and plainness,\nunmoved by joy or glory.\nDwelling in obscurity and remoteness,\nhe disregards profit and fame.\nHolding fast to tranquility and detachment,\nhe longs for an era of peace.\nAt ease in his leisure,\nhe composes these words,\nchanting the great *Yijing*,\nthe legacy of the Three Sages.\nExamining its purport,\nhe finds unity in its shared principles.\n\nThis is Master Wei’s account of his own refusal to chase worldly renown,\nhis deep entry into the realm of the Dao,\nhis serene and untroubled repose.\nComposing these words,\nhe condenses the legacy of the Three Sages,\nuniting their diverse threads into a single discourse.\nHe takes the crucible of Heaven and Earth as the great furnace,\ncirculates the qi of Kan and Li as the mechanism of transformation.\nFollowing its patterns and emulating its workings,\nhe declares: \"Even Heaven would not oppose this—\nhow much less man?\nHow much less spirits and gods?\"\nThus, the divine has no fixed form,\nand the *Yijing* has no fixed structure.\nCan one fail to harmonize their movement and stillness,\nfollow the ebb and flow of yin and yang,\nand accomplish transformation between being and non-being?\nHow wondrous!\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 89: Devotion Lies in Following Principle**\n\nDevotion lies in following principle,\nmanifesting and illuminating the spirit.\nDivine transformation flows unimpeded,\nbringing peace to the four seas.\nTaking it as a model,\nall ages may follow.\nOrdering it to govern,\nits practice is not cumbersome.\nDrawing it inward to nurture nature,\nembracing the naturalness of the Yellow and the Old.\nThose who contain profound virtue\nreturn to the root and revert to the origin.\nIt lies near in my heart,\nnot apart from my own body.\nEmbracing the One and never departing,\none may endure forever.\nPaired with dietary practices,\nthe male and female are arrayed.\nDiscard the martial cinnabar of Wudu,\ncast aside the Eight Stones.\n\nThe fire-timing must accord with the principles of yin and yang,\nthereby arousing the divine essence,\nfilling the Golden Palace,\nand harmonizing the chamber.\nFollowing the method to govern,\naffairs do not become cumbersome,\nand all ages may adhere to it.\nLet metal and water nurture nature within the Central Palace,\nallowing the Yellow and the Old to contain virtue within the inner image.\nWhen metal generates cinnabar mercury,\nit returns to foolishness and reverts to the origin.\nEmbracing the One in the womb,\nwater gives birth to the mother’s abode.\nThe maiden longs for her mother,\nand thus beginning and end endure forever.\nWithout arraying the male and female,\nresembling the true mother,\nno success can be achieved.\nIf one were to use the martial cinnabar of Wudu,\nor the Five Metals and Eight Stones,\nall such things may be discarded.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 90: Careful Application Brings Things to Fruition**\n\nCareful application brings things to fruition—\nwhat the world treasures.\nArranged in three lines,\nbranches and stems intertwine.\nThough they emerge differently named,\nall proceed from a single gate.\nNot merely redundant phrases,\nthis text harmonizes in parallel.\nYet it holds truth within,\nlike pebbles that may be admired.\nIf I were to spread falsehoods,\nI would only incur superfluous faults.\nEntitled *The Union of the Three*,\nglimpse but its beginning.\nFew words, yet profound meaning—\nlater generations should adhere to it.\nAbandoning the times to avoid harm,\nI take refuge in the mountains.\nWandering the vast expanse,\nI dwell beside the spirits.\nTransforming my form to become immortal,\nI sink into silence without sound.\nOnce in a hundred generations,\nI roam among men.\nSpreading my feathered wings,\nI soar east, west, south, and north.\n\nWhen Tang faced adversity,\ndrought and flood divided the wells.\nBranches and leaves withered and yellowed,\nlosing their flourishing splendor.\nThe virtuous bear one another’s burdens,\nand stability may endure forever.\n\nMaster Wei urges utmost sincerity in cultivation—\nthis medicine is the world’s most treasured substance.\nThe three lines refer to the Green Dragon, White Tiger, and Vermilion Bird—\nwood, metal, and fire.\nThe Returned Elixir is formed from nothing beyond these three,\nyet these three are fundamentally only two substances: metal and fire,\nnot yet the three of wood, metal, and fire.\nThese are the three inner images,\nnot external wood, metal, and fire.\nThough they bear many names,\nthey are but metaphors to exhaust principle,\nfor in truth, they proceed from a single gate.\n\nAs the text aligns words and compares matters,\nharmonizing in parallel,\nits value lies in distinguishing the profound from the shallow,\nremoving superfluous growths.\nThus, it is entitled *The True Union*,\nto glimpse its beginning.\nLater generations who adhere to and cultivate it\nmay dwell in secluded mountains,\nchoosing a place to settle,\naccumulating merit and virtue,\ndeparting from the world and leaving the mundane.\nThey unite their virtue with Heaven and Earth,\ntheir brightness with the sun and moon,\ntheir order with the four seasons,\ntheir fortune and misfortune with spirits and gods.\nUtterly precise and without error,\nthey elevate their practice.\nThus, the Perfected Lord of Yin sang:\n\"Without the proper ground, do not act rashly.\"\n\nOne must conceal and guard it in secrecy, carefully preserving and upholding it. Safeguard it lest the celestial and terrestrial mechanisms be lost. Upon attaining the utmost Dao, the body enters formlessness, seated yet alive, standing yet perished. Roaming freely east and west, neither water nor fire obstructs. The calamities of Yao’s floods and Tang’s droughts, the disasters of the nine yangs and six yins—all cease without trace.\n\n*Comprehensive Exegesis of the Zhouyi Cantongqi, Divided into Chapters, Concludes Below*",

His family had long worn the hairpin of office, yet he alone did not serve, cultivating the True in seclusion and nurturing his aspiration in emptiness and non-being. Profound in literary expression and versed in all apocrypha and prognostications, he embraced simplicity and guarded his purity, following only the Dao. He regarded carriages and robes as mere husks and chaff.\n\nIt is unknown from which master he received transmission, but he obtained the *Ancient Text of the Dragon and Tiger Classic* and fully grasped its wondrous purport. Thereupon, he drew upon the *Zhouyi* to compose the *Cantong Qi* in three scrolls.",

      "translated_text": "Moreover, it is said that as the subtlest details remained unexhausted, he composed the *Supplement to Omissions and Elisions*, a single scroll further expounding the profound mysteries of the alchemical canon. His exposition often employed allegory and borrowed events, veiling and revealing through variant texts. He secretly imparted this to Xu, the Attendant of Qingzhou, who then concealed his name to annotate it. By the reigns of Emperors Xiao and Huan of the Later Han, the Master transmitted it to his fellow townsman Chunyu Shutong, whereupon it circulated in the world.\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* was composed because the Master held that the cultivation of the elixir shares the same path as the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth, and thus he relied upon the images of the *Zhouyi* to expound it. Without exception, he borrowed the relationship of ruler and minister to illustrate inner and outer, employed *li* and *kan* to directly indicate mercury and lead, arrayed *qian* and *kun* to establish the measure of the crucible, clarified them as father and mother to bind the beginning and end, united them as husband and wife to constrain their intercourse—likening them to male and female—manifested them in generation, analyzed them into yin and yang, guided them through inversion and reversion, and revealed them in the dark and new moons. He connected them with ascent and descent, matched them with the hexagrams and lines, embodied them in transformation, followed the handle of the Dipper to take its cyclical stars, divided them by dawn and dusk, and illuminated them through the clepsydra. Thus, *qian* and *kun* became the crucible, yin and yang the embankments, water and fire the mechanism of transformation, the Five Agents the aids, true lead the progenitor of the medicine, mysterious essence the foundation of the elixir, *kan* and *li* husband and wife, and Heaven and Earth father and mother. Mutually deploying the eight trigrams, driving and directing the four seasons, dividing the three hundred eighty-four lines to circulate the firing times, and revolving the five planets and twenty-eight constellations around the crucible—only then could the Water Tiger conceal its form, lodging in *geng* and *xin* to turn westward, and the Fire Dragon subdue its body, pursuing *jia* and *yi* to revolve eastward.\n\nThe *Zhouyi* states: \"The sage, having perceived the traces of the world, models them in form and likeness, symbolizing their proper attributes.\" The Master thus took up these images. If not one of utmost penetration in the world, who could have achieved this? Behold: he cleaved open the primordial chaos, split asunder the vast expanse, directly pointed to the numinous root of Heaven and Earth as the progenitor of the medicine, and clearly beheld the sagely mother of yin and yang as the foundation of the elixir. He disclosed the origin of the One Qi’s transformations and revealed the basis of the Great Foundry’s generation. If not one of utmost comprehension in the world, who could have achieved this?\n\nSome may fix the clepsydra, divide the sundial’s hours, cluster yin and yang, dispatch spirits and ghosts, compress the three thousand six hundred breaths of primordial qi, and revolve the seventy-two seasonal nodes. They may move the sixty-four hexagrams’ yin tally, with the Celestial Pass in hand, and drum the twenty-four solar terms’ yang fire, with the Earthly Axis at heart. Heaven and Earth cannot conceal the mechanism of creation, nor can yin and yang hide the root of nurturance. Thus, the spirit transforms the primordial square, and pure generation arises. If not one of utmost clarity in the world, who could have achieved this?\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* states: \"The Golden Crucible of Chaos, white and black in accord; the Dragon Horse descends its essence, the mare and stallion intermingle their qi. Like frost upon horse’s teeth, like jade and dog’s fangs; mercury dwells with the astonished maiden, cinnabar mercury unites with the infant’s body.\" Distinguishing the qualities of the medicine, subtly revealing the elixir’s form, it fully encompasses the latent work of completed transformation and greatly manifests the portents of what has yet to germinate. If not one of utmost numinosity in the world, who could have achieved this?\n\nSome borrow the images of the lines to embed these matters, yet dare not leak the celestial mechanism, nor can they bear to conceal the profound principle. Thus, they unfold without cease, repeatedly weaving and threading, unable to desist, and so form scrolls. Their aim is to point out the essential Dao, to draw in those to come, and to grieve for those embodied beings who, in the end, become mere ghosts of utter yin. If not one of utmost benevolence in the world, who could have achieved this?\n\nThere are those who penetrate the virtue of the Three Luminaries, roam the essence of the Eight Poles, ingest golden sand to transform their form and substance, and feed upon fiery mercury to refine their essence and spirit. Thus, they attain a body of pure yang, a spirit born in the true dwelling, shed the Three Corpses to transcend the Three Realms, and ascend to the Upper Clarity as Perfected Transcendents. If not one of utmost authenticity in the world, who could have achieved this?\n\nAs for those who divide the *True Cantong Qi* into chapters and meanings, they take borrowing as their fundamental principle, with no fixed standard above or below. The text is broad, yet the Dao is upright; the matters are manifest, yet the words are subtle. Later generations discuss it, each taking what they see: some divide the characters to debate, others combine the sentences to annotate. There is no lack of divergent streams and separate currents, giving rise to disputes over beauty and ugliness. Those of shallow learning seek to investigate it but find it difficult to attain immediate clarity. Since the discussions at the beginning and end differ, the right and wrong in their choices remain uncertain. Now, chapters and sentences are divided and fixed, valuing the coherence of principle. The meaning is upright, the text follows, and the \"Gate of Medicines\" is appended, thus organizing four scrolls into three volumes, comprising ninety chapters to correspond to the number of the Nine Yangs. It is titled *True Meaning of the Divided Chapters*.\n\nThe main text is written in red, while the ancillary meanings are in black, clearly visible for perusal. The upper volume contains forty chapters, the middle volume thirty-eight, and the lower volume twelve. Within it is the *Song of the Crucible*, whose words and principles are interlinked, and whose characters and phrases are fragmented, making division into chapters impossible. Thus, it is preserved alone to correspond to the number of the One Water, symbolizing the completion of the yin and yang numbers in the Dao of the elixir.\n\nFurthermore, following the *True Cantong Qi*, I have composed the *Illuminating Mirror: Diagrams and Secrets*, a single scroll appended to the end of the lower volume, to further open the doors and windows of the *True Cantong Qi*. Having received transmission from my teacher and devoted years of study, I dare not conceal the profound text. Thus, I have diligently completed this true meaning, hoping—if only by a ten-thousandth part—to bequeath it to later generations.\n\nPreface by Peng Xiao, the True One of Flying Crane Mountain, who embodies Unity.",

      "translated_text": "The Way of yin and yang is enveloped and upheld, much like a skilled charioteer who follows the marking line, grasps the reins and bit, aligns the compass and square, and follows the wheel tracks. By abiding in the center to govern the exterior, the calculations are bound to the pitch pipes and calendrical cycles. The lunar phases consist of five or six days, with the warp and weft serving the sun’s command. Combined, they form sixty, with firmness and yielding possessing outer and inner aspects.\n\nIn refining the golden liquid and returning elixir, within the crucible lies the Golden Mother’s Flowery Pond—also called the Golden Womb Divine Chamber—where the four hexagrams Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li serve as the medicine. The \"lofty key\" refers to the pivotal mechanism, while \"enveloping\" means to encompass and enfold. Thus, there are the yin crucible and yang furnace, the firm fire and yielding tally, all adhering to the sixty-four hexagrams, cycling endlessly in mutual employment. Within this, the movements of spring, summer, autumn, and winter are enacted, dividing the twenty-four qi, segmenting the seventy-two seasonal nodes, compressing a year’s twelve months of climatic conditions into a single month, and further condensing a month’s conditions into the twelve hours of a day and night. The clepsydra is calibrated, the two crescents are distinguished, midnight and noon are separated, yin and yang are regulated, the dark and new moons are harmonized, the dragon and tiger are united, all in accordance with the great numbers of heaven and earth and the transformative mechanisms of yin and yang. If control and guidance are without error, and movement and transference are without loss, then externally, the tally of yin and yang is exchanged, and internally, the bodies of the dragon and tiger are generated. Thus it is said: A skilled craftsman follows the marking line without deviation; an able charioteer grasps the reins and bit without wavering, aligning with the compass and square and adhering to the wheel tracks. This is a metaphor for the adept refining the elixir in accordance with the fire phases.\n\nThe lunar phases of five or six days constitute thirty days; each day and night corresponds to one hexagram, totaling sixty hexagrams. The four hexagrams Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li are the parents of the medicine, the pivotal mechanism of the crucible and vessel. However, this does not refer to the numerical correspondence of day and night but rather encompasses the sixty-four hexagrams as a whole. \"The warp and weft serve the sun’s command\" means the hexagrams and lines serve as the warp of daily use, while the weft consists of the pitch pipes and calendrical calculations. \"Firmness and yielding possess outer and inner aspects\" refers to yang as firm and yin as yielding, with water and fire, metal and wood mutually serving as outer and inner.\n\n**Chapter Three: The Hexagrams *Zhun* and *Meng* at Dawn and Dusk**\nAt dawn, *Zhun* governs the affairs; by dusk, *Meng* assumes the duty. Each day and night corresponds to one hexagram, employed in sequential order. In circulating the fire phases of yin and yang’s ascent and descent day and night, all adhere to the sequence of one hexagram governing each day and night, beginning with the two hexagrams *Zhun* and *Meng* as the starting point. *Zhun* governs at dusk, and *Meng* at dawn, establishing this as the order.\n\n**Chapter Four: The Hexagrams *Ji* and *Wei* at Dusk and Dawn**\n*Ji* and *Wei* extend to dusk and dawn, ending only to begin anew. The celestial stems and earthly branches serve as the measure, with movement and stillness varying in earliness and lateness. *Ji* and *Wei* refer to the two hexagrams *Jiji* and *Weiji*. \"Dusk and dawn\" signify the alternation of dark and new moons, yin and yang, brightness and obscurity, going and returning. \"The celestial stems and earthly branches serve as the measure, with movement and stillness varying in earliness and lateness\" means yang pertains to movement and yin to stillness. Within the twelve hours, the early and late phases are divided, with yin and yang ascending and descending, the fire phases cycling endlessly in mutual employment.\n\n**Chapter Five: Spring and Summer Rely on the Inner Body**\nIn spring and summer, rely on the inner body, from *zi* to *chen* and *si*. In autumn and winter, employ the outer application, from *wu* to *xu* and *hai*. The yang fire advances the tally from *zi* to *si*, where pure yang governs, seeking outer yang from inner yin. The yin tally retreats the fire from *wu* to *hai*, where pure yin governs, with outer yang attaching to inner yin. This is the principle of the inner and outer bodies, the pattern of flourishing and decline, beginning with *Fu* and ending with *Kun*, all determined by the images of the lines.\n\n**Chapter Six: Rewards and Punishments Correspond to Spring and Autumn**\nRewards and punishments correspond to spring and autumn, with dusk and dawn aligning with cold and heat. The line texts embody benevolence and righteousness, expressing joy and anger in accordance with the seasons. Thus, they correspond to the four seasons, and the Five Phases attain their principles. The generative qi of spring is called reward; the astringent qi of autumn is called punishment. From *zi*, *chou*, and *yin* is spring; from *mao*, *chen*, and *si* is summer—these are the four yang fire phases. From *wu*, *wei*, and *shen* is autumn; from *you*, *xu*, and *hai* is winter—these are the yin tally phases. Within the twelve hours, the fire tally is circulated in accordance with these four seasons and Five Phases, aligning with dusk and dawn, cold and heat, benevolence and righteousness, joy and anger. The images of the lines must not deviate by even a hair’s breadth, hence it is said to be without loss. Within the crucible, the four seasons remain unblemished; within the image, cold and heat are unified—thus the elixir is surely formed.\n\nAn ancient song says:\nThe sage seizes the intent of creation,\nGrasping sun and moon to place within the crucible.\nSubtly inverting the essence of heaven and earth,\nBoring through yin and yang to move spirits and ghosts.\nWho recognizes the sun’s soul and moon’s spirit?\nThose who do are true immortals.\nRefining and ingesting for a thousand days,\nThe body, devoid of yin, cannot die.\n\nTherefore, in refining the golden liquid and returning elixir, if one does not model the images of heaven and earth’s creation and follow the natural principles, there will be no accomplishment.\n\n**Chapter Seven: Heaven and Earth Establish Their Positions**\nHeaven and earth establish their positions, and the *Yi* operates within them. Heaven and earth are the images of Qian and Kun. \"Establishing positions\" means arranging the positions of yin and yang in correspondence. The *Yi* refers to Kan and Li. Kan and Li are the two functions of Qian and Kun. The two functions have no fixed line positions, circulating through the six voids. Their coming and going are unfixed, their ascent and descent without constancy. Hidden and submerged, they transform within; encompassing and enveloping the myriad things, they serve as the warp and woof of the Dao.\n\n\"Heaven and earth establish their positions\" means modeling the crucible and vessel after the image of *Jiji*. \"The *Yi* operates within them\" refers to the circulation of yin and yang, Kan and Li, and the fire tally within. Having modeled the crucible and vessel after Qian and Kun, one further installs the Golden Mother within to complete the Three Powers of heaven, earth, and humanity.",

      "translated_text": "Kan and Li, the two functions without fixed line positions, refer to the external application of water and fire, their movement and stillness without constancy. Thus they circulate through the six voids, their coming and going, ascent and descent without fixed positions. Now hidden, now manifest; now active, now latent—they serve as the origin of all transformations and the mother of generation and completion. Hence they are called the warp and woof of the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Eight: Using the Non-Existent to Govern the Existent**\nUsing the non-existent to govern the existent, the vessel’s function is emptiness. Thus in the ebb and flow, Kan and Li vanish. The non-existent is the dragon; the existent is the tiger. The non-existent is the yang qi of mercury; the existent is the yin essence of lead. Lead and mercury reside within the empty vessel yet cannot generate transformation on their own. Through the ascent and descent of Kan and Li, propelling the four seasons, generation and completion become manifest. This is using the empty vessel to govern the existent with the non-existent. As the *Ancient Text of the Dragon and Tiger Classic* states: \"When the existent and non-existent mutually govern, the Vermilion Bird flames in the void.\" Thus when yin grows, yang retreats; when yang rises, yin recedes. In the alternation of ebb and flow, Kan and Li vanish in accordance with the seasons.\n\n**Chapter Nine: No Careless Creation**\nNo careless creation in speech, no groundless emergence in discourse. Drawing on evidence to verify effects, measuring and aligning with the numinous. Extending categories to structure characters, tracing principles for proof. Kan is the lunar essence of *wu*; Li is the solar radiance of *ji*. Sun and moon form the *Yi*, their hardness and softness in balance. Earth reigns over the four seasons, weaving the beginning and end. Green, red, white, and black each occupy their quadrant, all receiving the power of the central palace, the achievement of *wu* and *ji*. The sage does not carelessly fabricate empty words to delude later generations. Thus he cites the sun and moon as evidence, measures and aligns with the numinous, distinguishes hardness and softness, points to metal and water, compares dragon and tiger to grasp their images, moves yin and yang to fathom their essence, completes the work with the five earths, and binds it with the four seasons. Thereupon green, red, white, and black cycle in succession, all receiving the power of *wu* and *ji*.\n\nKan as the lunar essence of *wu* is lunar yin; *wu* is yang. This is yin containing yang, resembling metal-tiger born within water. Li as the solar radiance of *ji* is solar yang; *ji* is yin. This is yang containing yin, resembling mercury-dragon born within fire. Thus in refining the elixir, one gathers the essence of sun and moon, harmonizes the numinous qi of yin and yang. When the cycle of stellar numbers is complete and the movement of yin and yang concludes, all credit returns to the virtue of earth, and the numinous essence is perfected. \"Extending categories to structure characters\" refers to the character *Yi* resembling sun and moon.\n\n**Chapter Ten: The *Yi* as Image**\nThe *Yi* is image. Suspended images manifesting clarity—none greater than the sun and moon. Exhausting the numinous to know transformation: when yang departs, yin arrives. The spokes interlock as the wheel turns, emerging and entering, rolling and unrolling. The *Yi* contains three hundred eighty-four lines; drawing lines to extract tally-signs, the tally-signs refer to the sixty-four hexagrams. From the dark moon to the dawn of the new moon, Zhen arrives to receive the tally. At this moment, heaven and earth unite their essence, sun and moon mutually embrace. The male yang spreads its dark offering; the female yin transforms the yellow womb. Chaos intermingles, the root foundation is established. Cultivating and nourishing the bud, concentrating spirit to form the body. All things tread forth from it; no movement fails to arise from it.\n\nThe *Yi* is image. It is the sun and moon uniting to form one. The golden liquid returning elixir is nothing other than the union of the sun and moon’s yin and yang essences. Thus the essence of yin and yang emerges and enters, rolls and unrolls; day and night cycle endlessly, returning to the beginning. Approximately sixty-four hexagrams, following three hundred eighty-four lines; drawing lines to extract tally-signs, fire follows advance and retreat. When yin comes, yang departs; when yang hides, yin acts. The qi of east and west intermingle; the sentiments of husband and wife harmonize. At this moment, Zhen arrives to receive the tally. Heaven and earth unite their essence; sun and moon join their souls and spirits. Chaos resembles the hen’s egg, the two crescents uniting like chaos. The yang dragon and yin tiger within chaos bear the qi of mutual resonance, establishing the root foundation, nurturing the bud, until spirit congeals into form, ultimately becoming a refined entity. Thus within the crucible chamber is another heaven and earth. All creatures, from the smallest to the greatest, arise from it.\n\nThe male yang belongs to heaven, hence the dark; the female yin belongs to earth, hence the yellow. These are the old yang and old yin. Qian the father and Kun the mother alternately employ the fire tally to its utmost. Thus one knows that within a single crucible, the transformations are each illuminated as heaven and earth’s movement, giving rise to the ten thousand kinds. If the fire timing is lost, the addition and subtraction overdone, cold and heat unseasonal, advance and retreat misaligned—then within heaven and earth, by what seasonal markers would things generate their images? By what yin and yang would dragon and tiger be born?\n\n**Chapter Eleven: At This, Confucius**\nAt this, Confucius praised the primal chaos, the virtue of Qian and Kun pervading the void. Investigating antiquity to the primordial sovereign, the *Guanju* established the beginning. The qi of marriage and capping intertwine; the first year then germinates. Confucius praised the Dao of the *Yi*, dividing Qian and Kun as the origin of the myriad things, establishing *Xian* and *Da* as the model for husband and wife. He split the primal chaos, chiseled the undifferentiated, revealed the forms of ghosts and spirits, and communicated the sentiments of heaven and earth. Thus ruler and minister, father and son, husband and wife, male and female, the five phases mutually generating and overcoming—the mechanism of the myriad things’ transformations was exhausted. Thus Qian and Kun illuminated their pervading void.\n\nTherefore Master Wei compared the *Yi* to establishing the crucible vessel, moving the celestial mechanism, uniting the forms of dragon and tiger, harmonizing the bodies of husband and wife. Initially, the complete non-existent form and essence resembled the primal chaos. After kindling the fire and moving the tally, the male and female essences intertwined. Thus the mutual longing of the *Guanju*, the seeking of marriage and capping. From the first kindling of fire, the first year’s germination is fitting. Sun abiding in moon, the dragon and tiger’s forms are established.",

Having modeled the crucible and vessel after Qian and Kun, one further installs the Golden Mother within to complete the Three Powers of heaven, earth, and humanity.",

      "translated_text": "If the celestial omens and portents fall into disarray, their signs and tokens failing to align, then fortune and misfortune arise from the moving lines, and the talismanic fire loses its rhythm with dawn and dusk. This causes the outer five planets to fall into chaos, and the inner five qi to lose harmony. When the four and seven fall into discord, the circumpolar stars scatter and stray, and the crucible fails to generate and complete its work.\n\nThough the external fire moves and progresses, if the inner talisman remains still and unresponsive, then the celestial soul and terrestrial spirit fail to unite. Thus, the stars fall into disorder, the sun and moon deviate from their courses, the four seasons lose their balance, and the myriad things fail to flourish. This arises from the mismanagement of the fire, where summer and autumn lose their proper measure, causing the crucible to suffer from unseasonable drought or deluge.\n\n**Section Seventeen of the *Compendium of Literary Governance* states:**\nThe Literary Governance Compendium summons the scrutiny of the Three Ducal Ministers.\nAll officials and functionaries oversee their respective domains.\n\nThe Literary Governance Compendium refers to the Dipper’s handle bearing the basket—six stars known as the Hall of Literature: the first is the Supreme General, the second the Secondary General, the third the Noble Minister, the fourth the Director of Destinies, the fifth the Director of Records, and the sixth the Director of Calamities. The Three Ducal Ministers are the six stars beneath the Dipper’s handle, paired two by two, called the Three Terraces. Those who govern the world assist the Son of Heaven above in harmonizing yin and yang and aligning the four seasons, while below they ensure the suitability of the myriad things, enabling ministers and grandees to fulfill their duties. This mirrors the crucible receiving the qi of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things, generating and transforming within.\n\nWhen yin and yang fall into discord and the four seasons lose their proper measure, it is like the adept who directs the talismanic fire, whose regulation and balance exceed or fall short—hence the admonition and reproof.\n\nThe elixir of golden fluid and returning cinnabar lies hidden in the two words: *lead* and *fire*. To complete the work from beginning to end, one must first obtain true lead, and then—even more difficult—true fire. How could this be lightly discussed? Thus, Master Wei expounded it broadly, fearing that later generations might yet fall into confusion.\n\n**Section Nineteen: The Sun Harmonizes the Essence of the Five Phases**\nThe sun harmonizes the essence of the five phases,\nThe moon receives the discipline of the six pitch-pipes.\nFive and six make thirty degrees,\nOnce the cycle is complete, it begins anew.\nTracing origins and seeking ends,\nThe threads of survival and decay.\nAt times the ruler grows arrogant and excessive,\nOverbearing and transgressing the Dao.\nAt times the minister is devious and obsequious,\nHis conduct straying from the proper path.\nThe waxing and waning of crescents and full moons,\nDiscord and change bring misfortune and blame.\nThose who enforce the law admonish and criticize,\nTheir clumsy outcries leaving faults for the ruler to bear.\n\nThe sun harmonizing the essence of the five phases means that each month it once conjoins with the moon. The moon receiving the discipline of the six pitch-pipes refers to the metal and water within the crucible, which each month receive half of the pitch-pipe qi. There are six pitch-pipes and six complementary pipes, which the sun and moon share between them. The sun, moon, five planets, and celestial weave together generate the myriad things, just as the crucible receives the external qi of yin and yang, the talismanic rise and fall of midnight and noon, the essence of the five planets’ progression, and the purest union of sun and moon. Adversity and prosperity follow one another, survival and decay intertwine, cycling anew—beginning with *Return* and ending with *Receptive*.\n\nWithin the divine chamber, the yin essence resides in the central palace, dwelling in the virtue of earth and symbolizing the ruler. If the crucible responds internally but fails to act externally with focus, it is because the sovereign has grown arrogant and excessive, causing tribute from the four directions to cease. When ministers are devious and obsequious, the timing of the fire falls into error, the waxing and waning of crescents and full moons become irregular, and the dark and new moons bring misfortune and blame—all of which are laid at the ruler’s feet. The ruler is the metal essence, the earth virtue, the divine chamber. The ministers are the five phases, the six pitch-pipes, the essence and qi. Success or failure rests with the adept who directs the talismanic fire. From this, the maidservant flees, the red dragon bolts, the divine essence departs—what then remains of the golden fluid to seek?\n\n**Section Twenty: The Celestial Pole Receives the Proper Measure**\nThe celestial pole receives the proper measure,\nAt ease and unhurried, it governs below.",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Twenty-Five: The White of Gathering**\n\nGathering the white of its kind,\nRefining it yields the vermilion.\nTempered as defense and guard,\nWhite enfolds the steadfast core.\nSquare and round, a inch in span,\nBlended yet mutually bound.\nBorn before heaven and earth,\nMajestic and supremely exalted.\n\n\"Gathering the white of its kind\" means that at the first stirring of movement, white metal takes precedence.\n\"Refining it yields the vermilion\" means that in the forging, next the blazing fire completes the crimson.\n\"Tempered as defense and guard, white enfolds the steadfast core\" describes how white metal serves as the divine chamber.\n\"Square and round, a inch in span, blended yet mutually bound\" means the metal womb resembles the primordial chaos in form. It is crafted by dividing the upper and lower crescents, with the central chamber square and round, an inch in diameter, to house the true mercury. Once the two children unite, the seal is firm and impervious, allowing yin and yang to correspond without the slightest leak, nurturing the dragon and tiger. As the *Ancient Song* says: \"When the womb’s seal is unbroken, transformation occurs in an instant.\"\n\n\"Born before heaven and earth, majestic and supremely exalted\" means that true lead existed before the primordial chaos of heaven and earth. Lead attained unity and took form, then gradually gave rise to heaven and earth, yin and yang, the five phases, the myriad things, and all beings. Thus, lead is the parent of heaven and earth, the root and origin of yin and yang. The sage delves into the root of heaven and earth’s parents to establish the foundation of the great elixir, gathering the pure essence of yin and yang to form the substance of the returned cinnabar. This is no ordinary creation of things.\n\nTherefore, at the outset of elixir refinement, one must take the root of heaven and earth as the root of the medicine, and the mother of yin and yang as the mother of the cinnabar. If one cannot grasp the arising of heaven and earth and yin and yang in this interval, it is not the way of the golden liquid and returned cinnabar. If one uses what is produced *after* the existence of heaven and earth and yin and yang—such as the five metals, eight minerals, plant juices, wood ash, morning frost, night dew, snow broth, ice water, green salt, white brine, or any miscellaneous substances—how could success be anything but difficult?\n\nLet those of like mind ponder this deeply, and in time, they will awaken. Thus, a later passage says: \"After ten thousand repetitions, it may be grasped in darkness; the divine and enlightened may then fashion a person.\" This is also found in the eighty-third chapter of the lower volume.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Adjoining Walls and Gates**",

      "translated_text": "These are not the true methods of the Hidden Treasury—those #37 twisted paths that rebel against the Nine Capitals. Master Wei observes that世人 do not grasp the fundamental origin of the Great Dao/Way, instead rushing toward the crooked byways of side doors. Thus, some inwardly contemplate petty tricks, treading the steps of the demonic net, manipulating the Six Jia days and celestial stems—mere introductory steps for the ignorant. Others, when facing circumstances, #38 engage in qi-absorption, bedroom defenses, bending and stretching, grasping and sealing, holding breath and swallowing saliva. Through these, qi becomes chaotic, spirit exhausted, hun-souls wounded, po-souls wearied, leading the yang spirit to flee its palace, while yin thieves plunder the lungs and liver. This arises from internal and external mutual encroachment, the clash of yin and yang hours, the seven po wandering like dead corpses, the Three Corpses battling in the eyes, the hundred vessels seething, the Three Fields in turmoil. What was meant to ensure longevity instead harms life—how can one attain clarity and stillness?\n\nOthers externally erect altars and carve jade, sacrificing to wanton ghosts, hoping to encounter the Dao/Way and beg for extended years. This causes ghostly qi to infect essence and spirit, evil winds to rise in the heart’s chamber, sometimes manifesting in dreams, sometimes in apparitions of form and sound. They believe longevity is within reach, unaware that their fate lies in their own hands—only to hasten their demise, abandoning decayed remains. Such practices are manifold, all classified as heterodox paths.\n\nSeeking to move yet remaining stuck, desiring speed yet slowing further, they rebel against the utmost truth, deviate from heavenly principle, falsely claim the title of \"high Dao,\" openly defy the writings of the Yellow Emperor, obscure the true teachings, and entirely lose the essence of the Old Master’s intent. Therefore, Master Wei does not wish people to practice side doors. He urges them to #39 directly enter the true Dao/Way. Even if the various Hidden Treasury methods yield minor achievements, they ultimately cannot escape death and decay. Only the Golden Elixir of Returning Mercury, after ingestion, reverses aging into infancy, attaining the rank of True Person, sharing the eternal longevity of heaven’s position. Thus, the following text states:\n\nGolden sand enters the five viscera,\nmist scatters like wind and rain.\nSteaming and permeating the four limbs,\ncomplexion becomes joyful, lustrous, and fine.\nWhite hair turns black,\nnew teeth regrow.\nThe old man reverts to youthful vigor,\nthe aged woman becomes a maiden.\nTransforming form to escape worldly calamities,\nthey are called True Persons.\n\nAs stated in Chapter Thirty-Two of this scroll. The *Scripture of the Yellow Court* also says: \"One hundred and twenty years may still be restored, but beyond this, cultivating the Dao/Way becomes truly difficult. One must await the Ninefold Transmutation and Eightfold Jade Elixir, where the radiance of sun and moon rescues the old and frail.\" Thus, it is clear that this method is the supreme path of ascending to heaven in broad daylight and achieving immortality.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight: The Enlightened Examine These Principles**\nThe enlightened examine these principles,\nsuddenly understanding their origin.\nDiligently practicing them,\nday and night without rest.\nAfter three years of ingesting the elixir,\nthey lightly ascend and travel afar.\nCrossing fire without burning,\nentering water without getting wet.\nAble to appear and disappear at will,\neternally joyful, free from sorrow.\nWhen the Dao/Way is accomplished and virtue/power perfected,\nthey conceal themselves, awaiting the time.\nThe Great One #40 then summons them to dwell in the Central Continent #41.\nWhen merits are fulfilled and ascension achieved,\nthey receive the register and chart.\nMaster Wei warns those who love the Dao/Way: examine and fathom these principles, and you will naturally attain clarity. Once obtained, practice diligently day and night, never slackening from beginning to end. After the elixir is completed and ingested for three years, you will lightly ascend and travel afar, unobstructed by water or fire, able to sit and vanish #42 or stand and appear. Secretly performing hidden virtues, concealing yourself to await the time, the Great One will summon you to relocate to the Central Continent. Counting the days, you will ascend, receive the register and chart.\n\nThe Great One is the overseer of elixir refinement. The Central Continent is the Divine Continent. When世人 first attain the Dao/Way, their names are engraved on golden tablets in this land #43, receiving the register and chart #44 to achieve ascension.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: The Fire Record Is Not Falsely Composed**\nThe *Fire Record* is not falsely composed;\nit elucidates the *Book of Changes* to clarify it.\nThe crescent-moon method of the crucible,\nwith the White Tiger as the pivot of refinement.\nMercury as the flowing pearl of the sun,\naccompanied by the Azure Dragon.\nRaising the east to meet the west,\nhun and po naturally bind each other.\nThe waxing moon corresponds to the number eight of Dui,\nthe waning moon to the number eight of Gen.\nWhen the essences of both phases merge,\nthe body of Qian and Kun is formed.\nTwo eights make a pound,\nthe Dao/Way of the *Changes* stands upright, unshaken.\nA pound has three hundred eighty-four zhu,\nalso corresponding to the number of hexagrams and lines.\nThough the fire has its record,\nit must be regulated by the Dao/Way of the *Changes*,\nfollowing the hexagrams and lines,\ncirculating through Pi and Tai.\nThe crucible is shaped like an inverted moon,\nthe metal tiger within serves as the mechanism of the medicine.\nCinnabar mercury and the Azure Dragon,\npursued by the Vermilion Bird of Bing and Ding,\nfollow the time to enter the golden womb together—\nhence called \"raising the east to meet the west.\"\nHun and po refer to the eastern dragon’s hun and the western tiger’s po.\nThe upper and lower phases combine to form #45 a pound’s weight,\ndivided into three hundred eighty-four zhu,\ncorresponding to the two eights of a month’s cycle.\nThus, the forms of Qian and Kun are complete,\nmatching the number of a celestial revolution.\n\n**Chapter Thirty: Gold Enters the Fierce Fire**\nGold enters the fierce fire,\nits color unaltered, its radiance undiminished.\nSince the beginning of creation,\nthe sun and moon have never lost their brightness,\ngold has never lost its weight,\nthe sun and moon retain their usual forms.\nGold is originally born from the moon,\nreceiving the sun’s tally at the new moon.\nGold returns to its mother,\nas the moon wanes, the sun envelops it.\nConcealing its frame,\nit sinks into the cavernous void.\nGold regains its original nature,\nits majestic light rejoicing in the crucible #46.\nThe five phases overcome each other,\nfire overcomes metal.\nYet when metal encounters fire, it can be forged into tools,\nneither harming the other.\nThus, the golden womb in the crucible does not dissipate,\nits golden color growing ever more luminous.\nSince the establishment of the Qian and Kun crucible,\nthe sun and moon’s essences enter within,\nmutually benefiting each other,\nboth retaining their brightness.\nThe gold’s weight remains unchanged,\nthe sun and moon perpetually encircle and illuminate.\nGold is originally born from the moon—\ngold is yin essence, residing in the west,\nhence it is said that gold is born from the moon.\nFrom the new moon, it receives the tally of the celestial stems,\nthus generating gold.",

      "translated_text": "**Six Hundred Chapters (Continued)**\n\nThe *Fire Records*’ six hundred chapters represent the grand reckoning of fire’s cyclical movement under the stars, each dawn and dusk governed by a hexagram’s charge. Though termed six hundred chapters, their sequence remains uniform—thus the year aligns with the month, the month with the day, the day with the hour. Master Wei dared neither seal his tongue to obscure the great Dao nor commit it openly to bamboo and silk, lest he reveal Heaven’s mechanism. Hesitant and sighing, he feared his words might fail posterity. Thus, he briefly sketched their guiding principles, hinting at their branches, while reserving finer details for oral transmission.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven: Using Metal as a Dike**\n\nUse metal as a dike, and water enters in leisurely flow.\nMetal’s reckoning is fifteen; water’s count matches it.\nBefore the furnace, fix the weights—water exceeds by five parts.\nWhen these two are deemed true, metal’s weight returns to its origin.\nThe third does not enter; fire and the other two accompany it.\nThe three substances unite, their transformations wondrous as spirits.\nBeneath lies the qi of Grand Yang, steaming in but a moment.\nFirst it liquefies, then congeals—this is called the Yellow Chariot.\nAs years and months near their end, nature is undone, lifespan harmed.\nThe body becomes ash and dust, its form like dust on a bright window.\n\nThe Metal Mother resides in the central palace, serving as a dike for quicksilver. Thus, metal and water flow in harmony, their natures entwined. Metal and water follow the celestial stems, each receiving half the qi, together making a full catty’s measure. Having produced golden cinnabar, the mother remains undiminished—hence it is said, “metal’s weight returns to its origin.” The third that does not enter is true earth. Metal, fire, and wood—these three substances, driven by water and fire through the celestial stems, enter the vessel together. There, the three natures converge, the two flavors bind, and their transformations become wondrous as spirits.\n\nThe Metal Mother, steamed by the essence and qi of Grand Yang, first exudes liquid, then solidifies—this is named the Yellow Chariot. Through the cycles of stars, yin and yang, and the Five Phases, their functions are tested and interwoven. Retreating to conceal their forms, all merit returns to the central palace. The Yellow Emperor embodies the power of earth—thus it is said, “nature is undone, lifespan harmed.” Returning to earth’s power, they transform into earth, their spirit and essence resembling dust on a bright window.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Eight: Pounding, Refining, and Combining**\n\nPound and refine them together, then hold them to enter the Crimson Gate.\nSeal their junctures firmly, ensuring perfection and strength.\nBlazing fire rises from below, its roar ceaseless day and night.\nBegin with civil fire, refine it; end with martial fire, array it.\nObserve with utmost care, scrutinizing the balance of cold and warmth.\nCycle through the twelve nodes; when each ends, renew your vigilance.\nWhen qi wanes and life nears its end, rest to revive the hun and po.\nThe color shifts to purple, resplendent—returned cinnabar is formed.\nKnead it into a single pellet; the spatula’s touch is most divine.\n\nPound and refine the elixir’s foundation, fortifying and sealing it, then place it within the crucible—this is called the Crimson Gate. Water flows downward, fire blazes upward; waxing and waning advance and retreat, ascending and descending by day and night. Civil fire begins at midnight, martial fire follows until noon. From noon, the yin tally arises, continuing to midnight. Their movements alternate between closure and opening, regulated by cold and warmth. When the twelve nodes conclude, the cycle renews. Once the fire’s course is complete, the hun and po transform their forms. Turning to purple gold, resplendent cinnabar is achieved. Ingesting a single grain, the spatula’s touch becomes divine. The marvel of this work defies full description.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine: Calculating the Numbers of the Five Phases**\n\nCalculate the numbers of the Five Phases—they are concise, not cumbersome.\nRaise water to strike fire, and its light is suddenly extinguished.\nSun and moon press close, ever between waxing and waning.\nWhen water prevails, Kan encroaches on yang; when fire weakens, Li’s day darkens.\nYin and yang consume each other, their intercourse the Dao’s natural course.\n\nThe Five Phases are the qi of emptiness and nothingness, elusive and hard to name. If measured by the total reckoning of Heaven and Earth, their workings elude capture, yet within the crucible, the Five Phases bind themselves. Yin and yang mate, fire rises as water recedes, water excites fire’s decline. The sun’s essence stirs at dawn’s waning, the moon’s po concludes at dusk’s end. Male and female alternate, cinnabar and mercury engender one another. By Heaven and Earth’s nature, the Dao of the elixir is revealed.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Forty: Names Define Essence**\n\nNames define essence; graphs express the nature of words.\nWhen metal returns to its original nature, it is called Returned Cinnabar.\nI dare not speak falsely, emulating the sages’ texts.\nAncient records praise Dragon and Tiger; the Yellow Emperor extolled Golden Flower.\nHuainan refined Autumn Stone; Wang Yang added Yellow Sprout.\nThe worthy may uphold and practice this; the unworthy must not partake.\nThe Dao of past and present remains one—face-to-face, we speak of what is planned.\nScholars, redouble your efforts, lingering in deep reflection.\nThe essential words are plainly revealed, shining bright—they do not deceive me.\n\nMetal is essence; water is nature. Since metal gives birth to quicksilver, essence returns to nature. Moreover, metal is born of water, making water the mother of metal. Water, in turn, is born of metal, so metal becomes the mother of water—hence the name Returned Cinnabar. As stated earlier, “the mother conceals the child’s embryo, the child shelters the mother’s womb.” In the twenty-fourth chapter of this scroll, it is said...",

      "translated_text": "The regulation of yin and yang is this: in refining the Golden Liquor Returning Elixir, one must first determine the movements of yin and yang, then establish the *Qian* and *Kun* cauldron and furnace. The dwelling of *hun* and *po*—each serving as the other’s chamber—refers to the solar *hun* and lunar *po* mutually restraining each other within the golden chamber, forming the foundation of the elixir.\n\nNature presides within, establishing the inner and outer barriers, for nature belongs to metal. Metal governs the inner principle, receiving and stabilizing external signs to nurture the numinous mercury. The barriers and ramparts are the physical form. Emotion governs without, building walls and outer ramparts, for emotion is the fire of the talisman. Fire moves through the six voids, becoming cinnabar mercury and the city walls. The people are the cinnabar mercury. At this time, it is also through the movement and stillness of *Qian* and *Kun*, the flowing of qi and spreading of essence, that earth resides in the central palace, becoming the Dao’s abode. Yang submits, yin acts; prosperity comes as adversity departs. The punishment and virtue of yin and yang form the fundamental path of the medicine.\n\nNine returns, seven reversals, eight returns, six resides: this refers to metal’s generating number being four and its completing number nine; fire’s generating number being two and its completing number seven; wood’s generating number being three and its completing number eight; water’s generating number being one and its completing number six; earth’s generating number being five and its completing number ten.\n\nThe white male and the red female: metal initially arises from water and belongs to yin, associated with the northern *Kan* trigram, the male within the *Qian* household, thus called the *Kan* male, metal white. Hence, the male is white. Fire belongs to yang, associated with the southern *Li* trigram, the female within the *Kun* household, thus called the *Li* female, fire red. Hence, the female is red. Moreover, when metal is within the cauldron, it is the male, the husband of the *Li* female; when outside the cauldron, it reverses to become the female, the wife of the *Kan* male. Thus, the metal mother receives the qi of the Great Yang and produces the numinous mercury.\n\nRestraint settles water: this means metal and fire restrain each other, preventing the true water from flowing away. Water is the beginning of the five phases, for water’s generating number is one. Supreme goodness is like water: water is the mother of the myriad things, clear and without flaw, invisible to the eye. The Dao’s form and image: it operates subtly within the cauldron, transforming endlessly, impossible to depict. Transforming and spreading forth: this means the five phases each guard their boundaries, and the fire talisman does not err in the four seasons.\n\nAs in the sixty-fourth chapter, \"Like a Chicken’s Egg\":\nLike a chicken’s egg, white and black correspond.\nA span of one inch, the beginning.\nFour limbs and five viscera, sinews and bones complete.\nAfter ten months, it emerges from its womb.\nBones soft and pliable, flesh smooth as lead.\n\nIn refining the Golden Liquor Returning Elixir, there is an altar; upon the altar, a furnace; within the furnace, lightning; within the lightning, a cauldron; within the cauldron, a divine chamber; and within the divine chamber, golden water. The divine chamber resembles a chicken’s egg, as does the golden water. \"Like a chicken’s egg\" describes the layers enfolding one another. \"White and black correspond\" means gold and water envelop each other. \"A span of one inch\" refers to the placement of the numinous mercury. If the *Qian* and *Kun* pivot is employed, with *Kan* and *Li* generating and completing, after ten months the form is complete, no different from a human—four limbs, five viscera, bones, and flesh all whole.\n\nThese several lines reveal Master Wei’s disclosure of the inner and outer symbolic forms, the shape and appearance of cinnabar mercury. Lord Yin the True’s *\"Song of the Divine Chamber\"* says:\nThe earthen golden cauldron, seven spans in life and death.\nThe divine chamber, threefold bright, five inches in diameter.\nChaotic and wandering, heaven and earth, the five stars,\nYin and yang conjoined.\nResembling a chicken’s egg, the form without flaw.\nYellow and white, outer and inner, evenly thick and thin.\nSealed with six and one, guard well the noon gate.\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* also states: \"With water, the mother controls the earth.\" \"Flesh smooth as lead\": cinnabar arises from lead to symbolize the mother. Master Cao’s song says:\nA hundred moments reach the *Li* qi,\nFrom which cinnabar emerges.\nIts body like true pearls,\nThough cinnabar is not originally red.\nThis clarifies its form resembling true pearls, its flesh smooth like lead.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Five: The Burning Mirror Gathers Fire**\nWith the burning mirror, fire is gathered;\nwithout the sun, no light is born.\nWithout the moon and stars, the square vessel\ncannot yield water and broth.\nThe two qi are profound and distant,\nyet their resonance and transformation still communicate.\nHow much more so when near, stored within the body,\nclose to the heart and chest.\n\nYin and yang pair with the sun and moon;\nwater and fire serve as proof.\nIf the burning mirror and square vessel, moved by qi, can still generate water and fire, how could *Qian* and *Kun*, the sun and moon, set in place as symbols, fail to generate and complete? Moreover, when near, drawing from the body, and when far, drawing from things—first delving into the mother of heaven and earth to lay the foundation of the elixir, finally uniting the essence of the sun and moon to serve as the ancestor of the medicine—with kinds producing one another, water and fire restraining each other, how could there be no evidence of efficacy?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Six: The Three Treasures of Ear, Eye, and Mouth**\nThe three treasures—ear, eye, and mouth—\nfirmly sealed, do not let them scatter.\nThe true person hides in the deep abyss,\nfloating and wandering, guarding the compass’s center.\nTurning and curving to see and hear,\nopening and closing, all in harmony.\nAs the pivot for oneself,\nmovement and stillness never exhausted.\n\nThe *Li* qi inwardly defends and protects;\nthe *Kan* does not employ hearing.\nThe *Dui* joins without speech,\nfew words follow the primordial chaos.\nOnce these three are secured,\nrelax the body in an empty chamber.\nEntrust the will to emptiness and nothingness,\ntaking no-thought as the constant.\n\nProof is difficult to shift;\nthe heart is focused, not scattered.\nIn sleep, spirit and soul embrace;\nin waking, watch for life and death.\nThe complexion gradually moistens,\nthe bones and joints grow stronger.\nExpelling the host of yin demons,\nonly then is the true yang established.\n\nIf cultivation is unceasing,\nthe qi will ascend like clouds and rain.\nGentle as spring’s moisture,\nflowing like melting ice.\nFrom the head, it streams down to the feet,\nultimately rising again.\nComing and going through the boundless,\nfilling the space within.",

      "translated_text": "The \"flowing pearl of the Grand Yang\" arises when earthly qi responds to celestial qi, transforming into pearl-like dew—this is the pure essence of yang, capable of generating the myriad things. Though it possesses qi, it lacks form, hence it is called the \"Crimson Dragon.\" The yang fire transforms qi into cinnabar, thus fire gives birth to earth, and earth gives birth to metal. Metal is the mysterious essence of the Grand Yin, capable of nurturing the myriad things. Though it possesses qi, it also has substance, hence it is called the \"Golden Blossom.\"\n\nThe Crimson Dragon is originally born of *jia* and *yi*, also named the \"Azure Dragon\"—yang, father, husband, fire. The Golden Blossom is provisionally born of *geng* and *xin*, also named the \"White Tiger\"—yin, mother, wife, water. Thus, the meanings of the Azure Dragon and White Tiger are as such. Yet if yin and yang are inverted, the Five Phases interchanged, and male and female roles reversed, their significance shifts accordingly. The *Song of the Perfected One of Grand White* states:\n\n*\"The art of inverting the Five Phases—\nthe Dragon emerges from within fire.\nThe Five Phases move not in sequence—\nthe Tiger is born within water.\"*\n\nThe root of reverted cinnabar and the ancestor of Dragon and Tiger: the Dragon is born of fire, the Tiger arises from water. These words are immutable. The metal wife first intones, the wood husband scatters and bestows. The divine mother conceives, giving birth to the *chunü*. As the *chunü* gradually matures, her transformations are manifold. Sometimes she dissolves into water, sometimes her horse-teeth lattice appears. Though the metal mother originates from water, amid her transformations, the watery essence never ceases.\n\n\"Yang then goes forth to harmonize, their natures and dispositions spontaneous\" refers to the mutual generation of metal and mercury. \"When yin presses urgently upon the time, it is confined within the gate of restraint\" describes the succession of yin qi, which aids in protecting the inner palace. \"The compassionate mother nurtures and rears; the filial son repays the kindness\"—the compassionate mother is the inner embryo, while the filial son is true mercury. The *Song of the Perfected Yin Lord* states: \"True yang is cinnabar, true yin is mercury.\" Since mercury is born of the metal mother, this is called repaying kindness. Their mutual embrace and swallowing signify the intermingling qi of Dragon and Tiger.\n\n\"The stern father issues commands, instructing and admonishing descendants\"—*Qian* is the father trigram, which instructs all trigrams to assist the *Li* maiden and *Kan* youth, and the Five Phases together generate the mercury and cinnabar descendants. In reverted cinnabar, lead and fire are the ancestral principles, employed from beginning to end. The remaining qi, temporal markers, and auxiliary signs serve to establish the foundation of the spirit. Beyond this lies not the Way of the Golden Liquor Reverted Cinnabar.\n\nFire can melt metal, yet fire is born of wood, and metal in turn restrains wood—thus fire, metal, and wood reverse their constraints to flourish. An ancient song states:\n\n*\"Cinnabar is the essence of wood,\nonly when united with metal do they merge.\"*\n\nAnother verse says:\n\n*\"Once the Three Natures unite,\nthe Two Flavors naturally bind.\nThe embryo is firmly sealed, no leakage—\ntransformation occurs in an instant.\"*\n\nThe Three Natures are fire, metal, and wood. The Two Flavors are lead and mercury, Dragon and Tiger. Thus it is said: \"The Three and Five with the One— the celestial and terrestrial utmost essence.\" This may be transmitted orally, but is difficult to convey in writing—how could it be lightly discussed with the unworthy?\n\nThe annotation states: \"Reversing male and female\" refers to divine water restraining fire; yet within the divine chamber, fire in turn restrains metal. Thus mercury is the water within cinnabar, and metal is the cinnabar within water. Cinnabar gives birth to mercury, and metal gives birth to water.\n\n**You should turn right at *zi*, while *wu* rotates eastward. *Mao* and *you* form the boundary, establishing the two names of host and guest. The Dragon calls to the Tiger, the Tiger inhales the Dragon’s essence. Both devour each other, each coveting the other’s advantage. Thus they interlock and swallow, chewing and consuming one another. When *Yinghuo* guards the west, the *Grand Peace* traverses the heavens. Wherever the killing qi descends, what could remain unshaken? The cat guards the mouse, the sparrow fears the goshawk. Each fulfills its function—how dare any make a sound?**\n\nTurning right at *zi* reaches *you*; rotating east at *wu* arrives at *mao*. These twelve earthly branches mark the cyclical return of yin and yang, corresponding to the fire phases. The *mao-you* boundary signifies the equilibrium of metal and wood qi. The two names of host and guest are the designations of metal and wood. Since the Azure Dragon can exhale qi, the White Tiger thereby inhales its essence. Their essences intermingle, together generating purity.\n\n*Yinghuo* is the extreme yang fire number. \"Guarding the west\" means the fire qi presses upon the metal embryo. When metal receives the full brilliance of fire, its radiance fills the vessel. The metal qi, borne by fire, traverses the heavens—thus it is said: \"Wherever the killing qi descends, what could remain unshaken?\" Then the *chunü* and true mercury dare not flee, like a cat seizing a mouse or a sparrow fearing the goshawk.\n\n*Grand White* is the essence of metal. \"Traversing the heavens\" refers to *jia* and *yi*.",

Grieving for later seekers of the Dao, some relied on fragmented ancient texts, others explored esoteric scriptures and formulas, revealing only the shallow and superficial, disclosing the branches while concealing the root, falsely attributing it to metals and stones, confounding the ancestral lineage and obscuring the true pattern. Later generations, obtaining these, failed to investigate the traces, taking the text at face value, mistaking the false for the true, locking them in caskets, passing them on in mutual delusion. Thus some squandered wealth and neglected their livelihoods, vainly harming their Daoist aspirations. Therefore, I have specifically set down this chapter, valuing its brevity and ease of reflection, its concision and lack of entanglement. I expose its essential truth, not merely offering disordered verses, hoping to awaken the unenlightened and directly discuss cinnabar and mercury.

      "translated_text": "The transformations of the inner embryo’s gold and water manifest thus: the initial white is the gold disgorging its jade-like fluid. The subsequent yellow is the fluid transmuting into the Yellow Sprout. The red and black suffusing its surface and core signify the qi of water and fire, yin and yang, penetrating and harmonizing the embryo’s vitality.\n\nThe Gold Fluid Returned Elixir, being the first crucible, is called the Golden Sand Yellow Sprout. As the *Ancient Text of the Dragon and Tiger Classic* states: \"The husk is the essence of gold, and water encircles the yellow fluid.\" Ingesting a single grain, no larger than a millet seed, when the three-year term is complete, one ascends to heaven in broad daylight. It further declares: \"Among all elixirs, this is the most numinous trace—none attain longevity without it.\"\n\nWithin the Daoist gate, there are twenty-four great elixirs, all originating from the first crucible, the Golden Sand Yellow Sprout. Those not beginning thus belong to the side doors of material medicines and do not rank among the Gold Fluid Returned Elixirs. Formerly, Li Quan annotated the *Yin Fu Jing*, saying: \"Though the arts of the Returned Elixir number in the hundreds, the essence lies in the Divine Water and Flowery Pond.\" The \"hundreds\" refer to the firing times—withdrawing and adding, warming and refining, the elixir forms in ninety days. Another ten days complete the firing cycle, totaling one hundred days.\n\nThe essence lies in the Divine Water and Flowery Pond, for the Golden Sand Yellow Sprout emerges therefrom. Without this, one cannot discuss the true path of the Gold Fluid Returned Elixir—it is like cleaving open primordial chaos to behold the root of heaven and earth, or rending the vast expanse to witness the mother of yin and yang. Yet when the divine mother resides within the crucible, enveloped by the qi of yin and yang, it is as clouds drifting and rain descending. Water and fire operate, each returning to earth, and the medicine within the embryo changes its color and form with the seasons, its appearance unfixed—like indigo and sprouts dyeing green and yellow, or hides and yeast becoming glue and wine, transforming according to their original kind.\n\nThus, the sages probed the root and foundation of heaven and earth to become the parents of the Returned Elixir, employing the five phases to generate the numinous medicine. This is not achieved through the five metals, eight stones, or miscellaneous substances. The principles expounded here are luminously verifiable, like stars traversing the Han or waters flowing to the sea. The patterns are complete, the symbols fully arrayed—how could Master Wei have deceived us? Yet one must read these texts ten thousand times for their meaning to become manifest; or, with divine aid and awakened spirit, suddenly perceive their gate and door.\n\nThe *Dao De Jing* states: \"Heaven and earth are impartial, yet they ever bestow upon the good.\" A note clarifies: Some Daoist texts claim the three chapters of the *Cantong Qi* were each composed by Master Wei, Xu the Attendant, and Chunyu Shutong—this is gravely mistaken. Here, the Master appends *The Five Phases in Mutual Resemblance*, stating: \"I now compile this to fill omissions.\" Thus, it is clearly the work of Master Wei alone. Moreover, during the Tang, the Perfected Liu Zhigu of Shu presented his *Discourse on the Mysterious Pivot of Sun and Moon* to Emperor Xuanzong, which also elaborates on this—how then can doubts remain about the annotations of the Attendant or the transmissions of Chunyu? Now, these four chapters are divided into three scrolls, comprising ninety sections, corresponding to the yang number nine.\n\n**Chapter 84: Filling Omissions**\nThe *Cantong Qi* broadly sets forth its principles, yet it cannot maintain purity, overflowing in its discourse. Subtleties remain unaddressed, and gaps abound. I now compile this to fill omissions, refining its profound depths and linking its threads. Its purport is unified, its aims uncontradicted. Thus, I compose this, titling it *The Five Phases in Mutual Resemblance*, wherein the essence and nature of the *Great Change* are fully revealed.\n\n**The Five Phases Attain Harmony, Each with Its Correspondence**\nMaster Wei first expounded the three chapters of the *Cantong Qi*, unfolding its vastness, yet subtleties remained unaddressed. He then composed this *Five Phases in Mutual Resemblance* to fill omissions, such that the essence and nature of Qian and Kun, yin and yang, the five phases, and the cycles of beginning and end are fully revealed. The patterns of the Returned Elixir, from inception to completion, are now complete.\n\n**Chapter 85: The Essence and Nature of the Great Change**\nThe essence and nature of the *Great Change* each adhere to their measure. The Yellow Emperor and Laozi thoroughly investigated and applied them, verifying their efficacy. The work of the furnace and fire is truly grounded: the three paths emerge from one, all following the same route. Thus, the rituals of elixir refinement each have their proper measure. The Yellow Emperor and Laozi delved deeply into the Dao, leaving these texts. Comparing the work of the furnace and fire, it is truly grounded—the five phases share a common origin, and the three paths of metal, wood, and fire all proceed from a single route.\n\n**Chapter 86: Branches, Stems, Flowers, and Leaves**\nBranches, stems, flowers, and leaves bear fruit in abundance, yet all depend on the root. Do not lose your original nature. The words spoken in sincerity are precise and without error. In refining the Gold Fluid Returned Elixir, one must first recognize the root to yield flourishing flowers and leaves and abundant fruit. \"Do not lose your original nature\" means not losing true mercury. Recognizing true lead as the root of the medicine naturally produces the fruit of true mercury. Trust that these words will not mislead later generations.\n\n**Chapter 87: Like the Midwinter Season**\nLike the midwinter season, bamboo and trees all wither and decay.",
      "overlap_context": "tars traversing the Han,\nluminous as the sea, source of all waters.\nPonder it deeply until it is mastered,\nturn it over and examine it above and below.\nAfter a thousand cycles, resplendent and flourishing,\nafter ten thousand repetitions, it may be witnessed.\nThe numinous may reveal itself to man,\nthe heart’s spirit suddenly awakens.\nTrace its beginnings, seek its threads,\nand you shall surely find its gate and door.\nThe Way of Heaven is ever impartial,\nyet it is always transmitted to the worthy.",
