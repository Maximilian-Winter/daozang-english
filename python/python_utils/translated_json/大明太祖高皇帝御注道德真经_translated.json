  "full_translation": "**The Great Ming Taizu Gao Emperor’s Imperial Commentary on the Authentic Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue**\n\n**Title:** *The Great Ming Taizu Gao Emperor’s Imperial Commentary on the Authentic Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue*\n**Author:** Zhu Yuanzhang, Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty, in two scrolls.\n**Source Edition:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* Section, *Jade Instructions* Category.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to The Great Ming Taizu Gao Emperor’s Imperial Commentary on the Authentic Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue**\n\nI was born of humble origins. When the Yuan dynasty’s Mandate of Heaven waned and warlords rose in rebellion, I could not remain at peace in my hometown. Thus, I joined the army to preserve my life, narrowly escaping death. Before long, I broke free from the control of others, led the various warlords, and secured the lands south of the Yangtze. After thirteen years, I ascended the imperial throne, receiving Heaven’s Mandate to replace the Yuan and govern the people.\n\nSince my enthronement, I have been ignorant of the Way of the sagely kings of antiquity. Day and night, I have been anxious, fearing the weight of Heaven’s gaze. Reflecting on this, I sought the Dao from others, but each held only their own views, failing to grasp the wisdom of the ancient sages.\n\nOne day, I perused various books and chanced upon a copy of the *Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue*. I read it casually and found that several chapters were replete with profound principles. Though the text was simple, its meaning was abstruse, and I could not fully comprehend it. After setting it aside for ten days, I obtained another volume with differing commentaries. Upon further examination, I saw that each commentator held distinct interpretations, leading to such discrepancies.\n\nI reviewed them all and pondered the text deeply. With my own understanding, I seemed to grasp its essence somewhat and wished to attempt a commentary for posterity. Yet, fearing ridicule from future generations, I hesitated and did not proceed.\n\nMuch later, I came across a passage in the original scripture: *\"The people do not fear death—why threaten them with it?\"* At that time, the realm had just been pacified, the people were obstinate, and officials corrupt. Though ten were executed in the morning and a hundred more followed by evening, such measures continued unabated. Was this not precisely what the scripture described?\n\nI then abolished the harshest punishments, instead sentencing offenders to penal servitude. Within a year, my fears diminished. Re-examining the scripture’s words and their application, I saw them like dense clouds veiling layered mountains—outwardly insubstantial yet inwardly solid, their forms elusive, their true nature otherwise. They spanned empty valleys to reveal towering peaks, transforming ancient crags into secluded ravines in an instant. Without understanding its meaning, one wanders in primordial chaos. Yet, once its subtle essence is glimpsed, it is like the bright moon sinking into a limpid abyss or a mirror reflecting true images. Though their forms appear tangible, they cannot be grasped or touched.\n\nMoreover, the scripture states: *\"My words are easy to understand and easy to practice, yet none in the world can understand or practice them.\"* Reflecting on this, how could one not see the moon in water and the reflection in a mirror? In the stillness of midnight, I pondered deeply: the moon in water and the mirror’s image, though seemingly real, are empty and insubstantial. If not projected elsewhere, how could they cast a shadow? Thus, gazing at the heavens reveals the moon’s reflection in water, but abandoning the mirror to touch oneself confirms the reality of one’s own form. This is seeking truth beyond appearances, enabling one to probe a fraction of its subtle essence.\n\nThereupon, on the *jiayin* day of the twelfth lunar month in the winter of the seventh year of the Hongwu era [1374], I took up my brush and strove to expound upon it. Whether this will resonate with the aspirations of future sages remains unknown. Though my talents are meager, I recognize that this scripture is the root of all things, the supreme teacher of kings, and the ultimate treasure of ministers and people—not merely an art of alchemical elixirs. Thus, I have poured forth my sincerest intentions and exhausted my wisdom, hoping to benefit posterity. This is my commentary.\n\nThe work was completed on the *jiachen* day of the same month, and I have written this preface accordingly.\n\n---\n\n**The Great Ming Taizu Gao Emperor’s Imperial Commentary on the Authentic Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue, Scroll One**\n\n*\"The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal name.\"*\n\nFrom the Son of Heaven above to the common people below, those who aspire to practice the Dao must follow a path beyond that of ordinary people—this is the eternal Dao. The Dao is like a road: when one governs oneself and conducts affairs with a heart free of extraneous desires, adhering steadfastly to this path, the heart becomes the road, and the road becomes the heart. To hold fast without alteration is the eternal Dao.\n\n*\"The Dao that can be spoken\"* refers to the great Dao that surpasses others. Once the Dao is realized, its name endures—this is the eternal name, which can be practiced and cultivated.\n\n*\"Nameless, it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\nNamed, it is the mother of the myriad things.\"*\n\nThe Dao’s subtlety lies in its tranquility without name and its efficacy in motion—this is the state of *Wuji* (Ultimateless) giving rise to *Taiji* (Supreme Ultimate). For instance, as the ruler of the realm, the mechanism of good governance resides in my heart but remains unexpressed—who knows what name it bears? Only when enacted does it manifest as rewards and punishments. Yet it is not only the ruler’s heart that holds rewards and punishments; the virtuous and the noble, with resolve, can all benefit and sustain the myriad things. Thus, *\"nameless, it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth\"* refers to the noble person’s benevolent heart nurtured within, which, when expressed to aid the myriad things, becomes *\"named\"*—is this not the mother of the myriad things?\n\n*\"Always without desire, observe its mystery.\nAlways with desire, observe its manifestations.\"*\n\n*\"Without desire, observe its mystery\"* means that once the Dao is practiced, one does not seek external praise but examines truth with sincerity. Hence: *\"Always without desire, observe its mystery.\"* *\"Always with desire, observe its manifestations\"* does not refer to other desires but to the desire for the thorough completion of good deeds. Fearing incompleteness, one desires it further—not the desires for sensual pleasures, wealth, or profit. *\"Manifestations\"* refers to boundaries.\n\nThese two emerge from the same source but bear different names, and both are called *\"mysterious.\"* *\"Mysterious and again mysterious—gateway to the manifold mysteries.\"*\n\nThe preceding passage is extraordinary, thus it is further extolled.\n\n**Chapter One ends here.**\n\n*\"When all under Heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises.\nWhen all know goodness as goodness, not-goodness arises.\"*\n\nKing and ministers, commoners alike—those who can practice the Dao, steadfastly walking this great Way, must not layer another Dao upon the Dao, nor heap further goodness upon goodness. For all who artfully embellish these two matters, though they may seem fine, last but a moment and are not the enduring Dao. Thus, when beauty is exhausted, ugliness arrives; when goodness is spent, not-goodness follows.\n\nIf one who governs all under Heaven strives only to bring peace to the people, so that they know not the virtue of their ruler—just as the ancients’ rustic elder said: *\"What has the Emperor’s power to do with me?\"*—then:\n\n*\"Being and non-being give birth to one another,\nDifficulty and ease complete one another,\nLong and short shape one another,\nHigh and low incline toward one another,\nNote and sound harmonize with one another,\nBefore and after follow one another.\"*\n\nThis merely reprises the earlier text, hence the use of analogy and comparison.\n\nIt is said: once there is being, non-being arises; once there is difficulty, ease arises; once there is length, shortness arises; once there is height, lowness must arise; once there is harmony of sound, high and low tones must intertwine. Therefore the sage abides in non-action, teaches without words. The sage holds fast to the great Dao already perfected, adding no other deeds—this is called *\"non-action.\"* Teaching without words means not desiring the people to clamorously praise. Thus the following: *\"The myriad things arise yet he does not refuse them\"*—he nurtures all things without claiming ability. *\"The myriad things arise yet he does not refuse them, gives life yet does not possess, acts yet does not rely, accomplishes yet does not dwell.\"* Only because he does not dwell does he not depart. The sage benefits and sustains the myriad things without self-conceit, fosters them without monopolizing their use. *\"Accomplishes yet does not dwell\"* means achieving without self-mastery, allowing things their proper place. *\"Does not depart\"* means he does not abandon them.\n\n**Chapter Two ends here.**\n\n*\"Do not exalt the worthy, so the people do not contend.\nDo not prize rare goods, so the people do not steal.\nDo not display what is desirable, so the people’s hearts are not disturbed.\"*\n\nThe commentary of Caolu is exhaustive; I shall add further.\n\nLaozi’s meaning runs deep. In a state that exalts the worthy, maladies multiply; when rare goods are prized, the people suffer theft. Where maladies abound, though a state may have pure and good ministers and all under Heaven is at peace, if the ruler still exalts the worthy, deceit arises—virtue can be feigned. Once imitated, should such men later gain proximity to power, the pure and good ministers will either meet misfortune or depart. Thus Laozi says: *\"Do not display what is desirable, so the people are not disturbed.\"* In general, if the people know neither the exaltation of worth nor the rarity of goods, all under Heaven is at peace.\n\nTherefore, in the sage’s governance:\n*\"He empties their hearts,\nFills their bellies,\nWeakens their wills,\nStrengthens their bones.\"*\n\nThus the sage always remains frugal, not enriching himself, so the people prosper and their bellies are filled. When the people prosper, the state’s great foundation is secure. Yet he does not rely on the people’s prosperity to strengthen the state, lest other affairs arise. This is what is meant by *\"fills their bellies, weakens their wills, strengthens their bones.\"*\n\n*\"Always cause the people to be without knowledge, without desire.\"*\nThis means, as in the earlier text, not exalting the worthy nor prizing rare goods, so the people see nothing to covet.\n\n*\"Cause the knowing not to dare act.\"*\nKnowing the state does not exalt, though they may admire, they dare not act thus.\n\n*\"Act through non-action, and nothing is left ungoverned.\"*\nAll affairs are first diligently and reasonably attended to; once order is established, then there is non-action.\n\n**Chapter Three ends here.**\n\n*\"The Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible.\nProfound! It seems the ancestor of the myriad things.\"*\n\nThe principle of the Dao is subtle and far-reaching; its use is endless, yet when stilled, it has no form. If one were to exhaust it hastily, it would be improper—this is what is meant by *\"the Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible.\"* And *\"profound! It seems the ancestor of the myriad things\"*—if the noble person treads it, he must do so gradually.\n\n*\"Blunt the sharpness,\nUntangle the knots,\nSoften the glare,\nMerge with the dust.\"*\n\n*\"Abysmal! It seems ever-present.\"*\nIf one’s brilliance is keen and swift, one should temper its edge. If one’s heart is troubled, one should still its disturbances with tranquility. If one’s mind shines too brightly, one should restrain it, yet inwardly preserve that clarity, luminous and enduring. *\"Blunt the sharpness, untangle the knots, soften the glare, merge with the dust\"*—Laozi warns against excess in all things, thus one preserves virtue to extend benevolence.\n\n*\"I do not know whose child it is—it seems the ancestor of God.\"*\nLaozi sighs and asks: *\"I do not know whose child it is—it seems the ancestor of God.\"* The phrase *\"ancestor of God\"* may be difficult to annotate; following Caolu, it refers to the image of Heaven. Heaven is the sovereign and ruler—this is what is meant.\n\n**Chapter Four ends here.**\n\n*\"Heaven and Earth are not humane—they treat the myriad things as straw dogs.\nThe sage is not humane—he treats the people as straw dogs.\"*\n\nThis teaches that in all affairs, one must employ the constant Dao, not wantonly cherish or discard things. The so-called *\"straw dogs\"* were made of grass for ancient prayers; once used, they were discarded. If a ruler governs, does he then treat the governed like straw dogs after governance? If Heaven and Earth unite to form the four seasons, once formed, do they then cease to regulate the seasons? Thus Heaven, which completes Heaven and Earth through the four seasons, endures through all ages without pause or weariness, never ceasing its operation—this is how it achieves longevity. If a ruler orders all under Heaven and embodies Heaven’s constancy, then his governance of the people is not like straw dogs.\n\n*\"Between Heaven and Earth, is it not like a bellows?\nEmpty yet inexhaustible,\nThe more it moves, the more it yields.\"*\n\nThe sage’s heart is ever empty yet ever full, ever cherishing yet ever discarding. What he cherishes, he cherishes always.\n\nWhat he discards, he discards always. Thus he discards without discarding, cherishes without cherishing, and the people delight in spontaneity. The bellows is used as a metaphor: when observed, it appears empty and devoid of substance, yet when set in motion, its wind flows ceaselessly. Though it seems empty when gathered and viewed, it is never without potential. Generally speaking, the mechanism of wind is ever-present, just as the sage’s heart in governing the Dao is ever-focused—hence the comparison to the bellows.\n\n\"Much speech leads to exhaustion;\nBetter to hold to the center.\"\n\n\"The valley spirit does not die—\nThis is called the Mysterious Female.\nThe gate of the Mysterious Female\nIs called the root of Heaven and Earth.\nSubtle and unbroken, it seems to endure;\nIn use, it is never exhausted.\"\n\nA person’s vast qi is the spirit, and spirit is qi. Within the human body lies the heart, and within the heart lies an aperture—this aperture is called the valley. Qi is the spirit; if qi is ever-present, the valley spirit does not die, and with the valley spirit undying, one attains longevity. This is to take the ruler’s body as the realm, the state, and the myriad people, and the ruler’s spirit and qi as the king. If the king embodies the Dao and does not die, the myriad people all find peace. It is also to take the body as Heaven and Earth; if its qi does not act recklessly and remains ever-present within, this is called the root of Heaven and Earth. If properly nurtured, it endures unbroken; if its principle and function are constantly preserved, it will never be lacking.\n\n**Chapter Five ends here.**\n\n\"Heaven is long, Earth is enduring.\nThe reason Heaven and Earth can be long and enduring\nIs that they do not live for themselves—\nThus they can be long-lived.\"\n\nThat Heaven and Earth do not live for themselves is something people fundamentally fail to understand. Heaven and Earth do not generate themselves, yet one sees only wind, rain, frost, and dew benefiting the world’s people, enduring from ancient times to the present without cease. Never has Heaven been seen to generate itself—thus words are set forth to instruct later generations.\n\n\"Therefore the sage places himself last and finds himself first,\nSets himself outside and finds himself preserved.\nIs it not because he is selfless?\nThus he fulfills his self.\"\n\nOne who places himself last practices frugality and rejects extravagance. One who loses himself labors in heart and body to employ the Dao of governance, with the resolve to aid others and benefit all things. One who sets himself outside does not indulge in luxury or comfort, ensuring his preservation through enduring hardship before ease. Is it not because he is without selfishness that he acts thus to perfect his own Dao? What is this if not selflessness?\n\n**Chapter Six ends here.**\n\nThe highest virtue resembles water. Water benefits all things yet contends with none, dwelling in places all others disdain—thus it comes near to the Dao.\n\nHerein Laozi guides people to practice the Way, cultivate their nature, refine their virtue, and act with benevolence to benefit others and aid all things. For water’s nature moistens all without exception, bringing benefit to all without limit. The virtuous emulate it: humble yet never haughty, ever useful and beneficial—thus they embody the Dao.\n\nDwell in good places, keep the mind deep as an abyss, give with true kindness, speak with trustworthiness, govern with skillful order, handle affairs with competence, and act in timely accord.\n\nWhen one seeks out those of virtue to mutually perfect their conduct, abiding where the good are many, the mind’s goodness expands. If one discusses trust and action with the virtuous, then governance will know no disorder—hence “govern with skillful order.” Once the clarity of the governing Dao is known, in every matter one will act with competence. And when one moves, it will always accord with what is timely.\n\nThe earlier phrase “the mind deep as an abyss” describes one whose accumulated goodness is vast and whose conduct is inexhaustible, like the form of a deep spring.\n\nOnly by not contending does one avoid blame. This means one fulfills one’s duties without excess.\n\nChapter Seven:\nTo hold and fill it to the brim is not as good as stopping in time.\nTo grind and sharpen it to a point cannot be long preserved.\nThis is like a man carrying a bowl of water as he walks: if it is full, it spills; if half-full, it remains secure. Moreover, it neither spills nor wastes—thus to carry it full is wasteful and yields little. Hence the analogy of grinding and sharpening to a point: it cannot be preserved. This means that things and ambitions alike must not be taken to excess.\n\nGold and jade fill the hall, yet none can keep them.\nWealth and honor breed arrogance, and one thereby invites one’s own fault.\nTo retire when merit is achieved and fame is established—this is the Way of Heaven.\n\nWhy is it that those in the world who possess wealth and honor so often cannot preserve them? Because wealth and honor lead to recklessness, ceaseless pride, and boasting, which in turn give rise to other troubles that burden one’s person and name. This is to invite one’s own fault, and none can preserve them. Therefore, one uses the principle of retiring when merit is achieved and fame is established as a warning. “Merit achieved” means great accomplishment; “fame established” means the fulfillment of one’s aspirations. “Retiring” means to be modest and not pursue further glory—it does not mean to withdraw entirely.\n\nChapter Eight:\nCan you embrace the One with your soul and never depart from it?\nCan you concentrate your qi to attain suppleness, like an infant?\nCan you purify your profound mirror and leave no blemish?\n“Carrying” means using the body as a chariot and the mind as its reins, with the spirit as the soul. Taken together, body and soul are two things—hence the artful expression “carrying the soul.” In the philosophy of Laozi, the spirit-soul governs the corporeal soul. If one can keep the soul from departing the body, one remains robust. If the soul always abides in the body without straying, this is to “concentrate the qi.” Without aimless wandering or hidden selfish desires, this is to “purify the profound mirror.” With no selfish desires, one becomes pure and undivided—how then could blemishes arise?\n\nIn loving the people and governing the state, can you practice non-action?\nIn the opening and closing of Heaven’s gate, can you remain feminine?\nIn understanding all things clearly, can you do so without knowledge?\nIn conducting themselves and handling affairs, do the noble and the king govern without knowledge or action? They act in timely accord and ensure every action is good. In terms of the mind, they fully comprehend the world’s good and evil, preserving the good while discarding the bad. The noble can benefit others; the king can bring advantage to all things—this is what it means to love the people and govern the state. They do not allow the spirit to become rigid and masculine in its conduct—this is to remain feminine. Thus Laozi uses the breath through the nostrils as the “gate of Heaven,” positing that qi and spirit govern the body. If one recklessly strains the sinews and bones, causing the qi to become coarse and violent, this is the masculine. To harmonize qi and blood evenly is the feminine, bringing peace to the body so that the spirit endures. If the body is not at peace, the spirit will perish in time.\n\nAs in governing the state: the ruler is the master of the people. If the ruler acts recklessly at times, the people suffer disaster. When the people are exhausted, the state perishes—how true this is!\n\nTo give life and nurture it, to give life yet not possess it, to act yet not rely on it, to lead yet not dominate—this is called profound virtue.\nTo allow the people rest and enable them to accumulate resources is to “give life and nurture it.” The ruler does not lightly take from them—this is “not to possess.” When the world is at peace, the ruler does not flaunt his ability—this is “not to rely.” As the population grows, the ruler does not monopolize leadership but governs through the proper functioning of all offices—this is “to lead yet not dominate.” Such wondrous principle is called profound virtue.\n\nThirty spokes share one hub—where it is hollow lies the use of the wheel.\nClay is shaped into vessels—where it is hollow lies the use of the vessel.\nDoors and windows are cut to make a room—where it is hollow lies the use of the room.\nThus, what is present provides advantage; what is absent enables function.\n\nThirty spokes share one hub: this is the ancient method of wheel-making, where thirty spokes converge into a single hub to form a wheel—hence the saying, “thirty spokes share one hub.” This refers to a spare wheel kept in reserve. For those who possess a carriage, such a wheel is a convenience. When the main carriage breaks down and lacks a wheel, this spare is put to use—thus it becomes “the use of the carriage.” Clay is shaped into vessels: the clay, sticky and malleable, is fashioned into pottery. Those who possess vessels keep spares in case the primary ones break. If the main vessel is damaged, this one replaces it—thus it becomes “the use of the vessel.” The explanation of doors and windows: for those who own a house, doors and windows are fully prepared when the house is built. Anticipating wear over time, extra ones are kept in reserve. Hence the scripture says: “What is present provides advantage; what is absent enables function.” The sage teaches that in all matters, one must ensure both form and void are properly ordered, so that affairs do not collapse. How can rulers and subjects alike fail to embody this?\n\n---\n\nThe five colors blind the eyes,\nthe five tones deafen the ears,\nthe five flavors dull the palate.\nRacing and hunting madden the heart.\nRare goods incite harmful conduct.\nThus the sage attends to the belly, not the eyes—\nhence he discards the one and embraces the other.\n\nThis warns against indulging in desires, abandoning frivolous pleasures, prizing sensual beauty, and coveting wealth. The meaning is not obscure: it speaks of external obsession with hunting and internal obsession with sensuality, of reveling in wine and delighting in music, of towering halls and carved beams. The belly symbolizes the people. To “fill the belly” means that the five colors, five tones, five flavors, hunting, and wealth are all meant to bring the people joy. If the ruler refrains from taking them for himself, he forsakes the one and embraces the other—this is the Way of putting himself last yet coming first, of setting himself aside yet enduring. Wondrous indeed!\n\n---\n\nFavor and disgrace are both startling;\nregard great trouble as you would your own body.\nWhat is meant by “favor and disgrace are both startling”?\nDisgrace is lowly—\nto gain it is startling, to lose it is startling.\nWhat is meant by “regard great trouble as you would your own body”?\nThe reason I have great trouble is that I have a body.\nIf I had no body, what trouble could I have?\nThus, one who values his body for the sake of the world may be entrusted with the world.\nOne who cherishes his body for the sake of the world may be charged with the world.\n\nIf a ruler takes his body as the world, and fears great trouble for the world as if it were his own suffering, then the world will be at peace. Those who cannot do this place the world in peril. Hence, “favor and disgrace are both startling.” The petty man does not seek office, yet when he obtains it, he is startled and delighted. After long enjoyment of wealth and honor, he knows only how to exalt himself but not how to preserve it. When illness strikes, he seeks a physician and guards against the perils of rank as if guarding against illness—then he is secure. Failing this, the loss of favor startles him again. If a ruler is willing to take his body as the world, and the people’s bodies as his own, then the emperor’s body may traverse the realm alone without worry. But if he takes his body as his own and the world as the world, even with ten thousand armored soldiers at his side, he will still fear he cannot defend it. Thus, when the emperor loves the world as he loves himself, prosperity follows.\n\n---\n\nWhat cannot be seen is called *yi*,\nwhat cannot be heard is called *xi*,\nwhat cannot be grasped is called *wei*—\nthese three cannot be fully examined,\nso they merge into one.\n\nThis describes the subtlety of the Dao and its principles. “What cannot be seen” refers to the Dao; “what cannot be heard” refers to principle; “what cannot be grasped” refers to *qi*. *Yi*, *xi*, and *wei* describe its plainness and invisibility. “These three cannot be examined” means that these three are formless yet have form, have image yet are imageless—difficult to describe. “Merge into one” means to concentrate the *qi* and refine the spirit.\n\nAbove, it is not bright;\nbelow, it is not dark.\nEndless, it cannot be named—\nit returns to nothingness.\nThis is called the formless form,\nthe imageless image—\nthis is called the indistinct and evanescent.\n\nThe Dao and its principles are neither overly manifest nor obscure. To say they do not exist would be wrong, for they emerge and function with order. Their mechanism is nameless, as if withdrawn, silent and unknowable. Sometimes they have image yet no image, form yet no form—this refers to the human heart and the heart of the Dao, so profound and subtle that even the noble man finds them hard to preserve. Hence, they are indistinct and evanescent. Indistinct and evanescent: swift and elusive.\n\nApproach it, and you do not see its beginning;\nfollow it, and you do not see its end.\nHold to the ancient Dao to master the present.\nTo know the ancient beginning is called the thread of the Dao.\n\nThe oneness of the Dao and its principles is like seeing what cannot be seen and hearing what cannot be heard. If one holds to the great Dao of antiquity to govern the present, then the present becomes “what is.” The Dao of humanity is innate nature. Thus, “what Heaven imparts is called nature; following nature is called the Dao; cultivating the Dao is called teaching”—this is the thread of the Dao.\n\n---\n\nThe ancients who excelled as scholars were subtle, wondrous, and profoundly penetrating—so deep they could not be known.\nPrecisely because they could not be known, I force myself to describe them:\nCautious, as if crossing a frozen river;\nalert, as if surrounded by danger;\nsolemn, as if a guest;\nyielding, like ice about to melt;\nsimple, like uncarved wood;\nhollow, like a valley;\nopaque, like muddy water.\n\nThose who held to the Way possessed the purest *qi* of Heaven and Earth, attaining divine wisdom and refraining from reckless action.\n\nWhen set in motion, all affairs follow their principles. When stilled, the numinous spirit abides in the heart, and none can fathom their intentions—hence their profundity and inscrutability. Laozi employs metaphors and similes, while others forcibly impose names and appearances to scrutinize them.\n\nHesitant, as if crossing a river in winter;\nvigilant, as if wary of neighbors on all sides;\ndignified, as if a guest;\ndissolving, like ice about to melt;\nunadorned, like uncarved wood;\nvast, like a valley;\nturbid, like muddy water.\n\nThis describes the noble person who embraces benevolence and steadfast resolve. Others, being frivolous, cannot grasp their subtleties. Thus, seven probing analogies are presented, making their intentions even more elusive—all to urge later generations to cultivate the Way with such unwavering firmness. Yet within these comparisons, two creatures are named for hesitation, and a demeanor of solemnity is shown, mingled with indolence, then thickened with simplicity, stirred by clamor, and provoked by clamor to observe—seven in all, yet their true nature remains concealed. Thus, the sincerity of the noble person is difficult to sway; how could the petty mind ever match this?\n\nWho can settle the turbid and gradually clarify it?\nWho can stir the tranquil and gradually bring it to life?\nIf such a person exists, who can rouse them from stupor?\nWhen the noble person moves, who can still them?\nWhen the noble person is turbid, who can purify them to clarity?\nWhen the noble person is at peace, who can disrupt them with cunning?\nBefore the noble person’s intent takes shape, who can scheme to incite its budding?\n\nThose who preserve this Way do not seek fullness.\nOnly by not being full can they endure, avoiding renewal through decay.\nThis teaches that in cultivating oneself and safeguarding the Way, one must avoid excess. Thus, what decays does not renew, and what does not renew remains unbroken. If it is not broken, how can it be newly accomplished? Therefore, preserving this Way is not difficult at all.\n\n---\n\nAttain utmost emptiness, hold fast to stillness.\nTo attain utmost emptiness is simply to dispel delusion and selfish desire. To hold fast to stillness is to firmly guard a heart of few desires. *Dǔ* means utmost sincerity, truth.\n\nAll things flourish together, and I observe their return.\nMyriad things teem, each returning to its root.\nReturning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called reverting to destiny; reverting to destiny is called constancy; knowing constancy is called clarity. Not knowing constancy leads to recklessness and misfortune. Knowing constancy brings tolerance; tolerance leads to impartiality; impartiality leads to kingship; kingship leads to Heaven; Heaven leads to the Dao; the Dao leads to enduring, free from peril throughout one’s life.\n\nIn studying the Way, the noble person embodies Heaven and Earth, following the constant principles of the four seasons. Thus, they empty their heart to the utmost and hold fast to stillness, observing the cycles of all things—thereby emulating Heaven and Earth. Hence it is said: when all things flourish together, then observe their return. Destiny entails a beginning and an end, never disordered. The noble person who guards the Way and practices benevolence, like the four seasons in sequence, embodies the Dao. Thus, reverting to destiny means: things are born and grow, grow and mature, mature and withdraw, withdrawing to revert to destiny. As the next year follows, so too does constancy. One who knows constancy attains clarity in the Dao. Without knowing constancy or sequence, reckless action brings misfortune. Knowing constancy brings tolerance. *Knowing* refers to knowing the constant Dao; *tolerance* refers to a joyful countenance. When all under Heaven rejoice, impartiality arises. One who upholds this impartial Way and acts accordingly becomes a ruler of all under Heaven. One who excels in ruling all under Heaven embodies the Dao. By preserving the Dao, the ruler meets no ill end—hence no peril.\n\n---\n\nThe highest rulers—people do not know they exist.\nNext, they are cherished and praised.\nNext, they are feared and scorned.\nWhen trust is insufficient, there is distrust.\nThe supreme noble person spreads the Dao throughout all under Heaven, yet none recognize their merit—though merit exists. This is the highest.\nThe middling person, before the Dao is practiced, seeks others’ admiration for their abilities—this is called praise.\nThe lowest person uses force to subdue others, yet fails to win submission—this is called scorn. These truths are evident throughout history, yet some still do not believe. Hence it is said: when trust is insufficient, there is distrust—this is the case.\n\nCautious in speech, as if prizing their words,\nwhen their work is accomplished and affairs are settled,\nthe people all say, “We did this naturally.”\nWhen the noble person acts, they do not seek to display their abilities—thus affairs are settled. To flaunt ability is to manipulate affairs, and such contrivance will soon undermine success. But when one neither praises nor criticizes, affairs proceed smoothly and steadily. Though silent, over time the people will surely praise them—is this not natural? Thus, it is natural.\n\nWhen the great Dao declines, benevolence and righteousness arise.\nWhen wisdom and cleverness emerge, great deceit follows.\nWhen the six relations are disharmonious, filial piety appears.\nWhen the state is in chaos, loyal ministers emerge.\nAbandon benevolence and righteousness, and the people return to filiality and compassion.\nAbandon sagacity and wisdom, and the people benefit a hundredfold.\nAbandon skill and profit, and thieves and bandits vanish.\nThese three are insufficient as teachings.\nThus, let there be attachment to simplicity, embrace the uncarved, reduce selfishness, and diminish desire.\n\nThese—benevolence and righteousness, wisdom and great deceit, filial piety and loyal ministers—how wondrous, as Laozi observes! Why is this so? Such loyal ministers, filial children, and wise individuals first appeared in the time of Cheng Tang and the Zhou fathers, continuing through Qin and Han to the present, yet they remain rare. Laozi’s words imply no other intent but the restoration of the great Dao. What, then, is the great Dao? In the era of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, Yao and Shun, the great Dao prevailed: the six relations were harmonious, the people were all filial, and those who ruled all under Heaven ceded their thrones for the people. What need was there for loyal ministers when worthy officials were already in office?\n\nKings were unadorned—where could clever artifices be applied? The great Dao declined from the time Yu no longer yielded the throne. Tang was exiled, King Wu launched his campaign—thus arose the need to exalt benevolence and righteousness where none existed, to praise wisdom where folly reigned, and to celebrate filial piety where none was found. Laozi warned men to sever benevolence and abandon righteousness, to sever sagacity and abandon wisdom, to sever craft and abandon profit. Through these three severances, he showed later generations how to end the struggle for the throne, so that ruler and minister might live in peace.\n\nYet if one speaks in common terms—removing these transformations of righteousness, filial piety, sagacity, wisdom, craft, and profit—how could the world be at peace? Would this not be something never before heard? Thus Laozi himself said: \"These three teachings are insufficient in their literary expression,\" for people would surely fail to grasp his meaning. Therefore, he added further instructions, urging men to value frugality and simplicity, to reduce selfishness and diminish desire—these are the matters he addressed.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen**\n*Sever learning and there will be no sorrow.*\nTo fill one’s belly by exhausting worldly affairs—this is what \"sever learning and there will be no sorrow\" means. How wondrous! I have heard that Confucius had no fixed teacher. For the learning of worldly men can never encompass all worldly affairs. Even the most determined scholar knows but three or five parts of them. Yet among all the virtues in the world, whether in the wise or the foolish, though their measure differs, all possess them. Ordinary men cannot master them all, but only the Most High can take the virtues of others and make them his own—thus he follows no common Dao and bears no common name.\n\nThe *Classic* speaks of the \"Most High\"—this is no empty phrase of Daoists. It refers to the highest of men, those whom others cannot equal. Confucius, too, had no fixed teacher, for his learning was vast. When his vast learning was complete, the affairs of the world became clear to him. Thus it is said, \"At forty, he was free from doubt\"—this is what \"sever learning and there will be no sorrow\" means.\n\n*\"Ah!\" and \"Oh!\"—how far apart are they?*\n*Good and evil—how distant are they?*\nThe world’s people are foolish and unlearned, so Laozi set forth these words of \"Ah!\" and \"Oh!\" to warn them. \"How far apart are they?\"—these two words are but echoes of sound. In the space of this echo, one cannot distinguish right from wrong, leading men to speak evil. How could this be the conduct of a true scholar? As for \"good and evil,\" the phrasing merely deepens the meaning of the preceding text.\n\n*What men fear cannot but be feared.*\n*How vast and unending it is!*\nThis is why Laozi was no ordinary man. When worldly men hear of something to be feared, they all know to fear it, yet they do not descend into utter chaos. But when things reach their extreme, chaos becomes profound, and that chaos is without end. Laozi, hearing of this, foresaw the chaos before it reached its peak—thus he was neither chaotic nor afraid.\n\nMaster Caolu said: \"央 means 'to end.'\" *The people bustle and bustle, as if feasting on a grand sacrifice, as if ascending a spring terrace.* *I alone am tranquil, without sign, like an infant who has not yet learned to smile.* This is why Laozi stood above worldly men, and why his practice of the Dao was as such. As for those who indulge in extravagance, Laozi was not like them—why? Because the pursuit of the Dao differs from the enjoyment of worldly pleasures.\n\nThe difference lies in this: the Dao is the principle of the formless, and when skillfully applied, it is never exhausted. Thus one may fill oneself with it without ever growing weary. But the pleasures of feasting and revelry rely on external things and breed arrogance. Once full, they inevitably wane, for they dissipate the will and overuse material things. Therefore, Laozi embraced simplicity and held to constancy—not like an infant’s unknowing state, nor like a heart unaware of such joys, but by upholding the Dao and refraining from reckless action, adhering to the heavenly norms and earthly patterns.\n\n*I ride alone, as if with nowhere to return.*\n*The people all have more than enough; I alone seem to lack.*\n*How foolish is my heart!*\n*Vague and murky! While others are bright and clear, I alone am dim and dull.*\n*Others are sharp and discerning; I alone am muddled and confused.*\n*Drifting like the sea, blown as if without end.*\n*The people all have their uses; I alone am stubborn and coarse.*\n*I alone differ from others, for I value feeding on the Mother.*\n\n*\"I ride alone, as if with nowhere to return\"*—this describes the appearance of one riding a boat, not that he truly has nowhere to return, but that he delights in spontaneity. *\"The people all have more than enough; I alone seem to lack\"*—while others rejoice, he alone seems unmet, as if bereft of joy, like one without possessions. But this is not so—it is his adherence to the Dao. Thus he says: *\"How foolish is my heart!\"* *\"Vague and murky\"* describes his forgetfulness of schemes. The brightness and clarity of others are the ways of common men, while his dimness and dullness are his way of upholding the Dao. Is this truly dimness and dullness?\n\n*\"Drifting like the sea, blown as if without end\"*—this is neither sea nor wind, but his way of upholding the Dao, so that none know where he is bound. The sea is vast; the wind is long and sweeping. *\"The people all have their uses; I alone am stubborn and coarse\"*—\"have their uses\" means all men are as such. \"Stubborn and coarse\" describes the vulgarity of the common and shallow. But this is not to display such a steadfast heart. *\"I alone differ from others, for I value feeding on the Mother\"*—\"feeding\" means to nourish, to sustain. These two words signify nothing else but the steadfastness of cultivating the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen**\n*The bearing of great virtue follows only the Dao.*\n*The Dao as a thing is only vague, only indistinct.*\n*Vague! Indistinct! Yet within it are things.*\n*Indistinct! Vague! Yet within it are images.*\n*Profound! Dark! Yet within it is essence.*\n*Its essence is most real, within it is truth.*\n*From ancient times to the present, its name does not depart, for through it we behold the origin of all things.*\n\nHow do I know the nature of all things? By this.\n\nThe bearing of great virtue speaks of the appearance of profound power—if those who walk the Way can follow this as their model, how could it not be the extraordinary Dao?\n\nMoreover, the Dao as a thing cannot be perceived by hearing or sight; it arises suddenly, hence the words \"only vague, only indistinct.\" This is to prevent learners from abandoning it in their struggle to fathom it. It says, \"Vague! Indistinct! Yet within it are things,\" and again, \"Indistinct! Vague! Yet within it are images,\" lest one mistake it for mere emptiness, unreal and insubstantial. It specifically speaks of \"images\" to show that the principle of the Dao and virtue is never unreal. It also says, \"Profound! Dark! Yet within it is essence\"—this is the nature of essence. \"Essence\" is the flower of vitality. If one holds to this without wavering, then its truth aligns with heaven and earth, and within it, the essence is most real, possessing even greater certainty.\n\nWhat is this certainty? From ancient times to the present, the Dao has never diminished, and thus it is said that \"its name does not depart\"—this is immortality. \"Through it we behold the origin of all things\" means that the Dao endures while the myriad things flourish; this is the observation of things. \"Origin\" signifies beauty and splendor.\n\nAnd how do we observe the nature of all things? It is said: the Dao does not lose its truth; it constantly flows through the four seasons, ceaseless and unbroken. The abundance of life it generates is inevitable. Thus, those who teach others to hold to this Dao and act with sincerity are like shadows following the body, like echoes responding swiftly.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen**\nTo yield is to be preserved whole;\nTo be bent is to become straight;\nTo be hollow is to be filled;\nTo be worn is to be renewed;\nTo have little is to gain;\nTo have much is to be confused.\n\nThis teaches one to conduct oneself and act without excess. In studying the Dao and cultivating sincerity, one distinguishes truth from falsehood. Thus, yielding, bending, hollowing, wearing, and having little are metaphors against excess—only excess leads to confusion. For learners, though they may read widely, if they cannot distinguish truth from falsehood, how is this better than abandoning learning altogether? When truth and falsehood are not distinguished, falsehood brings disaster, and falsehood burdens goodness. Thus, how great is the difference?\n\nTherefore, the sage embraces the One and becomes the model for the world. Selecting goodness and rejecting evil, this is the Way. All goodness is unified, while all evil is fragmented. Thus, it becomes the model for the world—how could this not dispel excess and confusion? The extraordinary Dao emerges from this.\n\nNot displaying oneself, one becomes enlightened;\nNot asserting oneself, one becomes distinguished;\nNot boasting, one achieves merit;\nNot exalting oneself, one endures.\n\nOnly by not contending does the world have nothing with which to contend against one. The ancient saying \"to yield is to be preserved whole\"—was this an empty word? Truly, wholeness is restored to it.\n\nThe four instances of \"self\" in the preceding text serve but to elucidate the mechanism of the six characters—crooked, straight, hollow, worn, few, and many. If the former is understood in its entirety, the latter follows likewise. Even if one comprehends it fully, it remains but superficial discourse.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen**\n\"Few words accord with nature.\" Fierce winds do not last the morning; sudden rains do not last the day. Who brings these about? Heaven and Earth. If even Heaven and Earth cannot endure long, how much less can man? This speaks of petty men who imitate the Way, yet no sooner do they set their minds to governance than they crave praise—hence \"few words.\" \"Few words\" means hoping for others' approval. As for \"nature,\" it is again a warning against the extraordinary Way. Thus, Dong Zhongshu said: \"Rectify righteousness without scheming for profit; clarify the Way without calculating merit\"—this is what is meant by nature. When righteousness is rectified and the Way is clarified, the rest follows naturally! This \"nature\" is a caution. Who but an extraordinary person could embody the Way thus?\n\n\"Fierce winds do not last the morning; sudden rains do not last the day\"—this is a metaphor. \"Who brings these about? Heaven and Earth.\" Is it not said that even the power of Heaven and Earth cannot sustain wind and rain for a full morning? This is why those who do not know the Way speak thus. Hence, it is said: \"If even Heaven and Earth cannot endure long, how much less can man?\" The point is that those who speak sparingly resemble fleeting storms—even if they arise, they cannot last. Thus, it is stated:\n\nThose who align with the Way become one with the Way;\nThose who align with virtue become one with virtue;\nThose who align with loss become one with loss.\n\nIf one concentrates the will and devotes oneself to the Way, the greatest achievements are nothing short of the extraordinary Way. If one is resolved to spread virtue, one attains great virtue. If one employs deceitful schemes, one inevitably loses oneself through deceit. Why then does the text below speak of three alignments? To further clarify this principle. For example, in this world, whatever one aspires to become, one inevitably encounters corresponding outcomes—this is the verification of one’s desires. Those who favor this receive this; those who favor that receive that. It is inevitable.\n\nThose who align with the Way gain the Way;\nThose who align with virtue gain virtue;\nThose who align with loss gain loss.\n\nYet there are those who are neither fully trusting nor fully distrusting, wavering, and even those who wholly disbelieve—hence, \"Where trust is insufficient, there is disbelief.\" Favoring this, one gains this; favoring that, one gains that. Yet if this is so, why are there those who are hesitant or wholly unbelieving? Thus, the text continues: \"One who stands on tiptoe cannot stand firm; one who strides cannot walk.\" This is reiteration.\n\nOne who stands on tiptoe cannot stand firm;\nOne who strides cannot walk;\nOne who displays oneself is not enlightened;\nOne who asserts oneself is not distinguished;\nOne who boasts achieves no merit;\nOne who exalts oneself does not endure.\n\nIn relation to the Way, these are called \"leftover food and parasitic growths\"—things that others may despise, and thus those who possess the Way do not dwell in them. \"Standing on tiptoe\" and \"striding\" are metaphors. One with shortened limbs cannot stand on one foot; \"striding\" means leaping, jumping, or mounting a saddle before one is settled. Such actions prevent one from standing or walking—what one favors determines the outcome. What difficulty is there in understanding the four instances of \"self\"? They merely instruct one not to flaunt power or influence. All my actions aim only for naturalness. \"Leftover food and parasitic growths\" are forms of boasting. If you boast, who will not laugh? This is why the noble person does not indulge in such things.\n\n**Chapter Twenty**\nThere is a thing, formless yet complete, born before Heaven and Earth. Silent and void, it stands alone and unchanging, circulates without end, and may be called the Mother of the world. I do not know its name; I style it \"Dao\"; if forced to name it, I call it \"Great.\" Speaking of the limitless qi and principle before Heaven and Earth, it is like the unexpressed intent of a noble person’s benevolent heart—orderly within, silent and void, standing alone and unchanging. By its steadfastness and lack of reckless movement, it circulates without end and may be called the Mother of the world. \"Without end\" means constantly reflecting on the Way to avoid loss. If there is no loss, how can it fail to benefit all things? If this Way benefits all things, is it not their Mother? Though it is called a forced name, it is the Way of the Great Ultimate—hence, \"Great.\"\n\n\"Great\" means \"passing away\"; \"passing away\" means \"far-reaching\"; \"far-reaching\" means \"returning.\" \"Great means passing away\"—this refers to the Way’s fulfillment in bestowing upon things. When things receive the Way, it still returns to me—how is this not returning? \"Far-reaching\" means flowing everywhere. Thus, the Way is great, Heaven is great, Earth is great, and the king is also great. Within the realm, there are four greats, and the king occupies one of them. Heaven and Earth share in creation; the king models himself on Heaven and Earth, holding this Way between them. Compared to Heaven, Earth, and the king, how could he be a mere insignificant individual? Why does he occupy one of the four greats? Because he upholds the vast primordial principle of the Way—hence, \"great.\"\n\nMan models himself on Earth;\nEarth models itself on Heaven;\nHeaven models itself on the Way;\nThe Way models itself on nature.\n\nThese four instances of \"models\" merely clarify the four greats—they are said to successively uphold the great Way. Thus, \"Man models himself on Earth\" means that one who rules the world should embody Earth’s four seasons in harmonious succession as a constant principle for governance. \"Earth models itself on Heaven\" means responding to wind, rain, frost, and dew to nurture and harvest things. \"Heaven models itself on the Way\" means being formed gradually by the limitless qi. \"The Way models itself on nature\" means that when harmonious qi prevails, things do not decay—hence, it is natural.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One**\nHeaviness is the root of lightness; stillness is the ruler of restlessness. This is the Way of self-cultivation. In all matters, the noble person must first regard the self as weighty, then assess whether the action will preserve integrity and establish reputation before proceeding.\n\nThus, the four characters—heaviness, stillness, lightness, and restlessness—imply that one should not act rashly nor hesitate unduly. Therefore, the noble person travels all day yet never strays from the supply wagon. \"Travels all day\" means advancing the mind along the Way; \"never strays from the supply wagon\" means using this wagon as a metaphor for the self. The principle here concerns the human heart. The heart is where the spirit and soul reside; if the spirit and soul indulge in reckless thoughts and actions, failing to guard the heart and instead following desires, this is to abandon the supply wagon. It is like a general leading troops deep into enemy territory—how could he discard his provisions and march ahead? To march ahead is to lose one’s supplies, and thus the noble person maintains the self in this manner. Though there may be splendid sights and leisurely pleasures, he remains detached. This speaks to the firmness of the way of self-guardianship: even if I carry a precious treasure along the journey, and someone says there is a fine spectacle elsewhere, inviting me to view it together—this is what is meant by \"splendid sights.\" The noble person only knows to guard his own treasure, maintaining a still heart and desiring no other beauty; thus, he dwells in tranquility, transcendent. How could a ruler of ten thousand chariots treat his own person lightly in the world? Lightness loses the root; restlessness loses the ruler. This principle has already been illustrated: consider the former Zhou King Mu, who rode the Eight Steeds on his travels—was he not a ruler of ten thousand chariots who treated his own person lightly in the world? King Zhou of Shang severed the shins of those who waded through morning ice and carved out the hearts of the worthy—his restlessness went beyond mere impatience, for his cruelty was extreme. Thus, he lost his rule. Not only did he lose the world, but he also lost his own life.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two**\nThe good traveler leaves no wheel tracks; the good speaker leaves no flaws to censure; the good planner uses no counting rods; the good closer needs no bolt yet cannot be opened; the good binder uses no rope yet cannot be undone. The noble person’s Way is such that others cannot discern it, for he makes no boastful claims. He does not exalt himself; having no self-exaltation, how could he utter reckless words? With no reckless words, how could there be flaws to censure? My heart guards the principles of the Way all day; if petty men seek to spy or humiliate me, their approach lacks principle—how could they not be controlled by me? Would they devise schemes or employ counting rods? I possess the world, yet my defense lies at the four frontiers; the people are at peace, things are abundant, ruler and ministers share one heart, soldiers and civilians fulfill their lives and unite in purpose. Though I use no bolts or ropes to bind, who could skillfully open or undo what I have secured? Thus, the good closer and good binder are metaphors for the Way of nurturing the world’s people—then the world’s people become my closure and my binding. Could they be undone? Therefore, the sage always excels at saving people, and so discards no one. He always excels at saving things, and so discards nothing.\n\nThis is called \"inheriting illumination.\" The heart of the sage is neither good nor not-good. What is good? It refers to the Dao’s constant goodness bestowed upon people and things, for the Dao is eternally good. As for the absence of goodness, it is the people and things that lack principle which are not good. When it is said that people and things are not good, the sage never intentionally discards them—how could they not discard themselves? That he does not discard but constantly saves them is the constancy of the Dao. If one can follow this Dao, this is called not discarding. \"Inheriting illumination\" means the sage thereby perpetuates his clarity through all ages, hence it is called \"inheriting illumination.\"\n\nThus, the good person is the teacher of the not-good, and the not-good person is the resource of the good. Those who skillfully teach others do not act as teachers, yet enable others to become good. Where the noble person dwells, his heart is good and profound—how can his presence be unsettling? Those who dwell with him in such ease, do they not learn? Thus, though he does not teach the not-good, others become good—this is why he leaves no traces. Do you understand the resource? If one does not value their teacher nor cherish their resource, though knowledgeable, they are greatly deluded—this is called the essential mystery.\n\nNot teaching others yet having them emulate me is called not valuing one’s teacher. Not giving others material things yet having them attain my Dao is called not cherishing one’s resource. Such a one may seem ignorant, yet possesses subtlety—this is called the essential mystery.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three**\nKnow the white, guard the black, and become a model for the world. As a model for the world, constant virtue does not err, returning to the boundless. White is brightness; when it reaches its peak, it must wane, so one first guards the black. Black is the precursor of brightness, thus preserving one’s light without exhausting it. Such a one can serve as a model for the noble person. Those who can consistently apply this are men of constant virtue, whose hearts do not err. Without error, they cast aside selfish desires, unify their essence and spirit, and preserve it within—like the primordial qi of heaven and earth, this is the boundless.\n\nKnow the male, guard the female, and become a valley for the world. As a valley for the world, constant virtue does not depart, returning to the state of an infant. This teaches people to value softness over strength, hence the reference to male and female. One should liken one’s belly to the world’s great rivers, for the Yangtze and Yellow River contain the waves of all streams. Thus, the noble person compares his heart to them, ever possessing great virtue. With great virtue, one must not boast, but return to the guileless appearance of a child. Yet this is not true ignorance—it is merely preventing the heart from reckless action. The infant cannot act recklessly, hence it is called an infant.\n\nKnow glory, guard disgrace, and become a valley for the world. As a valley for the world, constant virtue is fulfilled, returning to simplicity. One who is wealthy yet fears disgrace guards it with severity, thus avoiding disgrace. Such a one can become a valley for the world. A valley is the low, distant place beneath great mountains—likened to the heart, belly, and chest. If one can be thus, then constancy prevails. With such constant virtue, though vast, one does not boast but returns the heart to purity. When simplicity scatters, it becomes vessels; the sage employs it, then becoming a leader. Thus, great governance is uncarved.\n\nWhen simplicity scatters into vessels, the sage employs it. Simplicity is the Dao not yet enacted; when it scatters into vessels, the Dao spreads. The sage employs it, then becoming a leader—not a leader in name, but the lord of men. Nurtured within and cultivated within, when scattered it becomes the Dao, circulating and gathering to return to simplicity and unity. Though said to scatter, it has never truly scattered—hence it is called \"uncarved.\"\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four**\nThose who would take the world and act upon it—I see they cannot succeed. The world is a sacred vessel; it cannot be acted upon. Those who act upon it fail; those who grasp it lose it. These are Laozi’s words of lament. Through this scripture, I now understand Laozi’s great Dao.\n\nLaozi says: \"I would take the world and act, yet I do not act—why?\" The world and the state are sacred vessels. What is a sacred vessel? It is the domain of heaven above and earth below, governed by the state. Thus, one does not dare to take it, saying: \"I see those who scheme for others’ states always fail.\" Even those who rule may fail—this is the mandate of heaven.\n\nLaozi says: \"If I were to act, it would only be when the mandate of heaven aligns and I cannot do otherwise.\" All things either lead or follow, either exhale gently or blow forcefully, either are strong or weak, either are upheld or destroyed—thus the sage eliminates excess, extravagance, and excessiveness.\n\nLeading and following: leading comes first, following comes after. The first is not yielding; the latter is capable of deference. Exhaling gently or blowing forcefully: exhaling gently is slow; blowing is rapid. Rapidity leads to exhaustion; slowness leaves surplus. As with strength and weakness: the strong may prevail over the weak, yet the strong will decline, and the weak will grow strong. Upholding and destroying: what is upheld will eventually not be upheld; what is destroyed will eventually rise again. Thus, one is cautioned not to defy the mandate of heaven with reckless action—this is the meaning of eliminating excess, extravagance, and excessiveness.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five**\nThose who assist the ruler with the Dao do not rely on military strength to dominate the world, for such actions rebound. Observing Laozi as a sage, he stands unmatched through all ages—why? Because of his profound subtlety.\n\nAs a minister, if one does not strive to assist the ruler with the Dao but instead pursues military strength, one betrays the ruler. One should hesitate to deploy troops, lest the ruler’s hesitation lead to inaction—this too is betrayal.\n\nThat its actions rebound means such conduct is contrary to principle, and the divine heavens do not permit it. If one wantonly harms living things without cause, the retribution will fall upon oneself or one’s descendants—such is a principle that cannot be evaded. Where armies encamp, brambles grow. In the wake of great armies, there are always years of famine. This further illustrates the relationship between ruler and minister: what is meant by \"years of famine\"? When a state deploys troops, whether to transport supplies to the frontier—exhausting the people and depleting resources—or to wage war within its borders—abandoning agriculture and leaving fields to waste—thorns and thistles take root. All these lead to scarcity, hence \"years of famine.\"\n\nThe virtuous act decisively, yet dare not seek dominance through force. Having acted decisively, they do not boast; having acted decisively, they do not vaunt; having acted decisively, they do not grow arrogant; having acted decisively, they do so only out of necessity. This is called acting decisively without force. Here, the text again admonishes rulers and ministers: when faced with sudden crises or justifiable causes, they should act swiftly. Having achieved victory, they must not proclaim it—this is what is meant by \"do not boast.\" \"Force\" refers to the excessive pursuit of military strength. \"Do not vaunt\" and \"do not grow arrogant\" both denote ostentation. \"Acting decisively out of necessity\" means acting only when there is no alternative. This is called acting decisively without force—such actions are not taken by choice, so how can they be considered forceful?\n\nWhen things reach their prime, they age; this is called \"not following the Dao,\" and what does not follow the Dao perishes early. This again illustrates that excessive use of force leads to decline—\"perishing early\" means that once decline sets in, it does not last long. In general, one must not habitually pursue military strength without cause.\n\nNow, fine weapons are inauspicious things, and some beings detest them; thus, those who embody the Dao do not dwell in them. This refers to those who, upon returning victorious from war, constantly boast of their military prowess. To claim such ability is inauspicious. Some beings detest them, for wherever armies march, lives are lost, and all things suffer harm. What are these \"things\"? They include supplies, weapons, banners, encampments, bridges, boats, chariots, and horses—none remain undamaged. Thus, some beings detest them. For this reason, the superior person carefully considers and does not dwell in such things.\n\nThe noble person values the left in times of peace, but the right in times of war. This speaks of war as an inauspicious affair: the left is the direction of vital qi, so the noble person resides there in peace, embracing its life-giving nature. The right pertains to metal, which governs killing and punishment, hence its association with war. Weapons are inauspicious tools, not the instruments of the noble person, and are used only when unavoidable. Serenity is paramount; even in victory, one does not celebrate. War is inherently a baleful instrument, employed only out of necessity. Thus, the noble person uses it reluctantly, and even in triumph, treats it as ordinary—this ordinariness is serenity. This is what is meant by \"not celebrating victory.\" To celebrate it is to delight in killing. Those who delight in killing cannot realize their ambitions under heaven. If one boasts of military skill, it is to take pleasure in slaughter—such a person cannot bring order to the world.\n\nIn auspicious affairs, the left is honored; in inauspicious affairs, the right is honored. Thus, the deputy general stands on the left, while the supreme general stands on the right. When many lives are taken, one mourns with sorrowful tears; victory in battle is conducted with the rites of mourning. How profound was the ancient reverence for human life! This is to prevent inauspicious affairs from overshadowing the auspicious and to honor the value of life.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six**\nThe Dao is eternally nameless. Though its uncarved simplicity may seem small, none under heaven dare treat it as a subject. If lords and kings can uphold it, the myriad things will naturally submit. The nameless Dao refers to the great virtue of a benevolent heart. Though its simplicity may appear subtle in the mind, who would dare regard it as insignificant? This simplicity is the true principle; \"not daring to treat it as a subject\" means not daring to belittle it. If rulers and kings can preserve it, the myriad things will naturally submit—submit in the sense that all beings come to offer tribute.\n\nIf the nobility and common lords can uphold it, their names will align with heaven and earth, and they will be deemed worthy. However, to equate lords with kings is an error. When heaven and earth unite, sweet dew descends. No one commands it, yet it falls evenly. Such is the marvelous workings of the Dao’s principle: the descent of sweet dew requires no command, and no one knows who orchestrates its even distribution—it arises naturally from harmonious qi.\n\nWhen systems of governance begin, names arise. The transformative power of virtue is like this: \"sweet dew\" is but one of its names. This echoes the earlier discussion of \"nameless\" and \"named.\" Before the Dao is applied, it is nameless; once applied to things, it takes their names—this is called \"having a name.\" Once names exist, one must also know when to stop. Knowing when to stop ensures one does not fall into peril. Names arise from things, and thus one must halt—why? Because once a noble person completes a task, they must not add further artifice. Adding artifice leads to ruin; refraining from it is called \"knowing when to stop.\" Once one knows contentment, one can avoid danger—this is what is meant by \"not falling into peril.\"\n\nThe Dao’s presence in the world is like rivers and valleys flowing into the great rivers and seas. When the Dao resides in the heart of a noble person and is firmly upheld without forgetfulness, it is like the waters of the Yangtze and Yellow River. When clouds and rain arise in the world and the hundred streams overflow, they all return to the sea—how do we know this? The sea is where the great yin gathers; yin ascends and transforms into clouds and rain. When the Dao is put into practice, it overflows like rivers; when it overflows, it returns to the sea—such is the Dao’s essence and function.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven**\nTo know others is wisdom; to know oneself is clarity. To overcome others is to possess strength; to overcome oneself is to be strong. One who can know others possesses wisdom. One who can know oneself, even in small matters, is deemed good. One who can overcome others without effort is said to possess strength. One who can overcome oneself is truly strong.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight**\nTo be strong in this way, one must know contentment in all these matters. One who knows contentment is rich; one who strives with determination possesses resolve. I have my own possessions—if I guard them without greed, my hold upon them is firm, and thus I attain true wealth. Furthermore, one who strives with determination is said to have resolve, for the noble person reflects upon the Dao without ceasing day or night. Having resolve, their affairs will surely come to fruition.\n\nOne who does not lose their proper place endures; one who dies yet does not perish enjoys true longevity. \"One who does not lose their proper place endures\" means that in these matters, if one constantly guards and practices them, their name will endure for ten thousand generations without decay—this is what is meant by \"dying yet not perishing.\" Who does not know longevity? The Buddhists speak of \"neither arising nor ceasing\"—this is precisely it. Yet, fearing that people might remain foolish and deluded, they speak of emptiness and nothingness, whereas here it is said that practicing the Great Dao yields such results.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine**\nThe Great Dao overflows, extending left and right. The Great Dao is vast—how could its principle, boundless and formless, be confined to left or right? All things depend upon it for life, yet it does not speak; its work is accomplished, yet it does not dwell. The Dao’s grace pervades the world, and the myriad things arise by its power—yet once they are born, what does the Dao say? The noble person practices the Dao, taking non-boasting as their highest duty. The reason for not boasting is to not claim credit. \"Not claiming credit\" means that even when affairs succeed, one does not attribute the achievement to one’s own ability.\n\nIt clothes and covers the myriad things yet does not act as their master. Ever without desire, it may be called \"small.\" The Dao is like thick silk, clothing and covering all beings. If it could be named, the Dao’s virtue would not desire to be named—thus it is called \"small.\" The myriad things return to it yet do not know it as their master—this may be called \"great.\" Once the Great Dao is enacted, the myriad things each find their place. I do not claim ability, yet afterward, all things return to me—this is what is meant by \"great.\" Therefore, the sage is able to perfect their greatness because they do not consider themselves great. Thus, they achieve greatness.\n\n**Chapter Thirty**\nHold fast to the Great Image, and all under heaven will come. Coming without harm, there is peace and tranquility. \"Holding fast to the Great Image\" refers to the fundamental essence of the Dao. It also signifies the great position and great name of the ruler, as well as governance. The ruler’s position is the people’s greatest treasure—if one upholds it with constancy and without recklessness, all under heaven will return. \"Return\" means to follow, hence \"all under heaven comes.\" Once the multitude submits and returns, if one governs with care and diligence, all under heaven will be at peace—this is \"peace and tranquility.\"\n\nMusic and delicacies make passing travelers stop. The Dao, when spoken, is bland and without flavor. Look for it, and it cannot be seen; listen for it, and it cannot be heard; yet in use, it is inexhaustible. If the ruler nurtures the people with proper methods, even those who have rebelled will return. \"Passing\" means departing; \"stopping\" means returning to stay. As for the Dao, it is formless and traceless. When spoken, it leaves no evidence and has no savor. One may look but not see it, listen but not hear it—foolish people may think it does not exist. Yet the highest good employs it, and it never runs dry—this is what is meant by \"inexhaustible.\"\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One**\nTo gather, one must first expand.\n\nTo weaken, one must first strengthen.\nTo abolish, one must first exalt.\nTo seize, one must first give.\nThis is called \"subtle illumination.\"\nThe soft overcomes the hard; the weak overcomes the strong.\nFish must not leave the depths;\nthe state’s sharp instruments must not be shown to others.\nSoftness is shallow yet its mechanism is hidden—only the wise can master it.\n\n**End of Annotation.**\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two**\nThe Dao constantly does nothing, yet nothing is left undone.\nWhen the Dao governs the world, one must focus the mind and hold fast.\nWhat is held resides in the heart;\nwhat is done dwells within.\nFormless and traceless, the Dao abides eternally—\nthis is \"doing nothing, yet nothing left undone.\"\nIf lords and kings can hold to it, the myriad things will transform of themselves.\nGreat benevolence and great virtue, ever practiced without change,\nin time will bring all under heaven into compliance.\nTo \"hold fast and practice it\" is to ensure the people will follow.\nWhen transformation stirs desire, I will quell it with the Uncarved Block of nameless simplicity.\nThe Uncarved Block of nameless simplicity will itself remain free of desire.\nWhen the kingly Way spreads throughout the realm, the people follow and the customs of the state grow pure.\nIn time, the people prosper, and men grow extravagant—\nthus must it be quelled.\nFor the king must lead by frugality, so that superiors act and inferiors emulate,\npreventing indulgence.\nWithout desire, in stillness, the world will right itself.\nWhen the king embodies this, the rest will transform without waiting—inevitably.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three**\nHighest virtue does not act as virtue, and thus possesses virtue.\nLesser virtue does not let virtue go, and thus lacks virtue.\nHighest virtue does nothing, and has no purpose in doing.\nLesser virtue acts, and has purpose in acting.\nHighest benevolence acts, yet has no purpose in acting.\nHighest righteousness acts, and has purpose in acting.\nHighest propriety acts, and when none respond, it rolls up its sleeves and forces compliance.\nThus, when the Dao is lost, virtue arises;\nwhen virtue is lost, benevolence arises;\nwhen benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;\nwhen righteousness is lost, propriety arises.\nPropriety is the thinning of loyalty and trust, and the beginning of chaos.\nForethought is the flower of the Dao and the beginning of folly.\nTherefore, the great man dwells in the thick, not the thin;\nabides in the real, not the flowery.\nThus he discards the latter and takes the former.\n\nGreat virtue suffuses the myriad things without self-aggrandizement,\nletting them follow their nature—\nthis is how it possesses virtue.\nLesser virtue does not let virtue go, and thus lacks virtue:\nits virtue is small and its capacity shallow.\nFlaunting its own ability, it becomes devoid of virtue—\nthis is how it lacks virtue.\nHighest virtue does nothing and has no purpose in doing:\nits affairs are already settled, leaving nothing to be done,\nnor does it value cleverness—\nthis is \"having no purpose in doing.\"\nLesser virtue acts and has purpose in doing:\nit values cleverness, and thus \"has purpose in doing,\"\nwhich will corrupt virtue.\nThe distinctions of highest benevolence, highest righteousness, highest propriety,\nthe four losses, and dwelling in the thick or thin, the real or flowery—\nall these are Laozi’s words on the rise and fall of the world,\nwhen the great Dao is not established.\n\nWhat is the great Dao?\nIn the age of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, the great Dao flourished.\nTake Emperor Yao and Shun, or Shun and Yu:\ntheir official systems remained unchanged, rites and music were in order,\nwise rulers and worthy ministers brought peace to all under heaven—\nwas this not the great Dao? Was this not prosperity?\nWhat is decline?\nJie and Zhou were unfit to rule, using all under heaven to adorn themselves.\nGovernance waned while depravity grew;\nproper sounds faded and wanton sounds arose—\nthis is what is meant by the great Dao’s virtue, benevolence, righteousness, rites, and music falling into decay.\nThese things, which were absent during the reigns of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors,\nwhen all under heaven was simple and unadorned—\nthis is why it was called the great Dao.\nAfter Jie and Zhou corrupted the Dao, Tang exiled one and Wu overthrew the other—\nwas this loyalty or righteousness?\nJie and Zhou lost the virtue of Tang and Yu, and thus met such ends—\nwas this prosperity or decline?\nYet from this rise and fall, benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, and trust became manifest.\nHow could this not be called decline?\nIt is not that the world’s goodness is beautiful—\nit is rather that it is not beautiful.\nThus, the earlier passage in this scripture speaks of \"rejecting benevolence and abandoning righteousness,\"\nnot wishing to see such things.\nIt desired only the benevolence and righteousness of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors—\nhow could this be Laozi’s fault?\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Four**\nOf old, those who attained the One:\nHeaven attained the One and became clear;\nEarth attained the One and became stable;\nspirits attained the One and became numinous;\nvalleys attained the One and became full;\nthe myriad things attained the One and came to life;\nlords and kings attained the One and became the standard for all under heaven.\nTheir attainment was the same.\n\nOf old, those who attained the One—\nthis was the primordial qi of the Nameless Beginning.\nThis qi was the great principle of the Dao.\nWith this qi, heaven and earth were formed,\nso heaven and earth attained the One and became clear and stable.\nSpirits are the rulers of heaven and earth,\nthe most refined qi.\nWhen gathered, they become spirits;\nwhen transformed, they shift from formless to formed—\nthis is what is meant by \"attaining the One and becoming numinous.\"\nValleys are the human world between heaven and earth.\nHeaven and earth are empty at their center, forming valleys,\nand harmonious qi fills the space between—\nthe myriad things are born in abundance,\nwhich is what is meant by \"becoming full.\"\nEach of the myriad things receives its corresponding qi,\nand when the most refined is just sprouting,\nthis is called \"attaining the One and coming to life.\"\nKings and ministers, riding the essence of heaven and earth without pretense,\nlet the great Dao prevail—\nthis is what is meant by \"becoming the standard for all under heaven.\"\nThis passage teaches people to hold fast to the great Dao without recklessness—\nwhether king or minister, scholar or commoner, one may be at ease.\nIf heaven lacked this principle, it would fear splitting;\nif earth lacked it, it would fear erupting;\nif spirits lacked it, they would fear fading;\nif valleys lacked it, they would fear drying up;\nif the myriad things lacked it, they would fear perishing;\nif lords and kings lacked it as their standard and grew haughty and exalted, they would fear collapse.\nIf heaven lost this principle, it would risk breaking apart.\nIf earth lost it, it would risk quaking and sinking.\n\nShould spirits lose this, they would grow ineffectual.\nShould valleys lose it, the human world would lack all things.\nShould the myriad things of the world lose it, they would fail to be born and face extinction.\nShould kings and ministers lose it, they would lack the Dao and their states would perish.\nShould the scholar-gentleman lose it, his honor and nobility would collapse.\n\nThus, the noble takes the lowly as its root, the high takes the low as its foundation.\nTherefore, lords and kings call themselves \"the orphaned,\" \"the widowed,\" and \"the unworthy.\"\nIs this not taking the lowly as their root?\nThus, the highest praise is no praise.\nOne does not desire to gleam like jade or clatter like stone.\n\nFor the humane and the noble, it is essential to esteem humility as auspicious.\nHence, it is said that kings call themselves \"the orphaned,\" \"the widowed,\" and \"the unworthy\"—\nthese three terms, in common parlance, are names of the small and virtueless,\nyet kings and ministers adopt them, signifying their refusal to exalt themselves.\nCan the petty man boast of himself?\nThus, the common saying: \"Those who speak ill of me are my teachers;\nthose who speak well of me are my deceivers.\"\nTherefore, the lowest praise is no praise.\nOne does not desire to gleam like jade or clatter like stone—\nboth are terms of flattery and sycophancy.\nThe noble man holds fast to the Dao without wavering;\nwhat need has he for praise?\nThe petty man delights in it excessively and thus enters a realm of harm.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Four**\n\nReversion is the movement of the Dao;\nweakness is the function of the Dao.\nAll things under heaven are born of being;\nbeing is born of non-being.\n\nThe highest scholar, hearing the Dao, diligently practices it.\nThe middling scholar, hearing the Dao, sometimes keeps it, sometimes loses it.\nThe lowest scholar, hearing the Dao, laughs greatly at it.\nWithout such laughter, it would not be the Dao.\nThus, the established sayings have it:\nThe bright Dao seems dim;\nadvancing in the Dao seems like retreating;\nthe level Dao seems uneven;\nsupreme virtue resembles a valley;\nthe purest white seems sullied;\nabundant virtue seems insufficient;\nestablished virtue seems indolent;\ntrue substance seems mutable;\nthe great square has no corners;\nthe great vessel is late in completion;\nthe great tone is faint in sound;\nthe great image has no form.\n\nWhen the Dao prevails, it covers the myriad things.\nWhen things are sufficient in use, the Dao returns to me.\n\"Reversion\" as its movement—once returned, it will move again.\nKings, ministers, and noble men hold fast to the Dao in body and guard it,\nnever for a moment forgetting it.\nThis is how they become kings, ministers, and noble men—\nsuch is the function of the Dao.\n\nAll things in the world, once born, must perish;\nthis is the natural principle and the guiding norm of heaven and earth.\nThis is what is meant by \"born of being, being born of non-being.\"\nThus, the ancient sages practiced the Dao throughout their lives,\nholding to it day and night without negligence.\nThe middling man sometimes practices, sometimes not;\nwhen he hears others praise it, he practices again.\nWhen he does not, he claims the Dao is obscure and its effects slow—\nhence, \"sometimes keeps it, sometimes loses it.\"\nThe lowest man not only fails to practice it but,\nwhen others speak of the Dao, laughs outright.\nSome, failing to examine it, do not respond at all.\nOr, if told the Dao cannot be practiced,\nthe noble man debates with the petty man,\nwho, like one lost on a path, finds the way of the Dao most difficult.\nIf one retreats and offers him a level path,\nit is like a shuttle moving through tangled weft—no thread is drawn.\n\nAgain, it speaks of valleys, disgrace, insufficiency, indolence, mutability,\nlack of corners, late completion, faint sound, and formlessness—\nthese are what was previously called \"good conduct leaves no tracks.\"\nSo too with guarding humility.\nThe Dao is hidden and nameless,\nyet only the Dao is good at bestowing and completing.\n\nThe Dao gives birth to the One;\nthe One gives birth to the Two;\nthe Two gives birth to the Three;\nthe Three gives birth to the myriad things.\nThe myriad things bear yin and embrace yang,\nand through the blending of qi, they achieve harmony.\n\nWhat people despise are \"the orphaned,\" \"the widowed,\" and \"the unworthy,\"\nyet lords and dukes take these as their titles.\nThus, things may be diminished yet increased,\nor increased yet diminished.\nWhat others teach, I also teach:\n\"The strong and overbearing do not meet a natural death\"—\nI take this as the father of my teaching.\n\nThe softest under heaven gallops through the hardest under heaven.\nNon-being enters where there is no space;\nthrough this, I know the benefit of non-action.\nThe teaching without words, the benefit of non-action—\nfew under heaven attain these.\n\nAlas! How sagely is Laozi!\nHow utterly he illuminates the Dao!\nHe says, \"The Dao is hidden and nameless\"—truly so.\nThe Dao is the qi that precedes heaven and earth;\nhow could people see it?\nYet, as it is good at bestowing and completing—how fitting!\n\nTo lose the principle of the Dao is to lack nothing in benefit;\nthe myriad things rely on it for life—\nhow could they not borrow from and depend on it?\nAgain, he speaks of the subtlety of the Dao’s principle in this way.\n\nThe Dao is the One qi that precedes heaven and earth.\nIt ascends, pure, to become heaven;\nit sinks, turbid, to become earth—\nthus, the One gives birth to the Two.\nHeaven and earth are called the Two Modes,\nand together with the One qi that precedes them, they make Three.\nOnce the Two Modes are established, the Four Images shine forth—\nthese are the sun, moon, stars, and constellations.\nFrom these arise wind, rain, frost, and dew,\nand the four seasons fall into order, giving birth to the myriad things.\n\nThey bear yin and embrace yang;\nwhen things flourish, they return to the source, which pertains to yin.\nReturning to the source, they emerge again—this is embracing yang.\nYang is inherently firm, but when yin penetrates it, yin and yang harmonize.\nThis is how the One gives birth to the Two,\nthe Two gives birth to the Three,\nand the Three gives birth to the myriad things.\nThe way of yin tending toward yang—\nall things are completed through humility.\n\nIs this not how the noble man practices the Dao?\nMoreover, the ancient kings called themselves \"the orphaned,\" \"the widowed,\" and \"the unworthy\"—\nthese three terms, which people regard as unworthy,\nkings nonetheless adopt as names—this is humility.\nAgain, he compares flourishing and decline to increase and decrease,\ncalling it the constant Dao.\n\nRegarding the three instances of \"teaching\":\nthe first two refer to what can be taught,\nwhile the third refers to those who \"do not meet a natural death\"—\nthese are the untaught who come to such an end.\nLaozi says, \"I take this as the father of my teaching\"—\n\"father\" here means the root and origin of principle,\nnot the father of a family.\nHe speaks of \"the softest under heaven galloping through the hardest under heaven,\"\n\"non-being entering where there is no space\"—\nthrough this, I know the benefit of non-action.\n\nThe term \"non-being\" refers to what? It speaks of the Dao’s essence as utterly soft. What is \"the hardest with no gaps\"? It refers to things like metal and stone, which only yin and yang can penetrate. Knowing the benefit of non-action stems from this. It means that softness leaves no trace. The Dao—this teaching of the Master is a teaching without words—is especially refined. \"Without words\" means the Dao transforms things without speech; is this teaching through words? Thus, the benefit of non-action. The benefit of non-action lies in acting without acting yet still bringing benefit. It is not that one does not act, for the great principle is ever in motion. The noble person, wishing to establish peace, never ceases to pursue the Dao. Though silent, their intent is already formed. When they act, it accords with the proper measure, like the turning of the four seasons, responding to things as the time arrives. This Dao is not for the great noble person; even with many words, one cannot teach it, and thus few attain it.\n\n**Chapter 35**\nWhich is dearer, name or self? Which is greater, self or wealth? Which is more harmful, gain or loss? Therefore, excessive love incurs great cost, hoarding much leads to heavy loss. Knowing contentment avoids disgrace; knowing when to stop avoids danger. This is how one endures long.\n\nAlas! How profound and subtle! Shall the foolish think Laozi does not value heavenly rank? Not so. His warning against the greedy specifically uses \"excessive\" to follow the preceding text, then gathers it with \"knowing,\" and finally shows \"enduring long\" as the lesson. Thus, I compare it as follows: Among the great duties of the state, the highest office beneath the king is that of the chief minister. If not by heavenly mandate, can one abandon this to covet the throne? Can the six ministers, without the ruler’s command, slanderously occupy the prime minister’s seat? Examining the order of ranks, all offices are the same. Which is dearer, which greater, which more harmful? The noble person’s dearness lies in daily drawing nearer to the Dao, their abundance ever in the Dao. The petty person’s harm lies in failing to study the Dao, coveting ill-gotten fame, and hoarding wealth. Ill-gotten fame is easily lost, and hoarded wealth, though vast, must be defended—hence heavy loss. The noble person guards their mandated name and stores only what they rightfully possess. This is called knowing contentment to avoid disgrace, knowing when to stop to avoid danger, and thus enduring long—ever unbroken.\n\n**Chapter 36**\nGreat perfection seems flawed, yet its use never wears out. Great fullness seems empty, yet its use never ends. Great straightness seems bent, great skill seems clumsy, great eloquence seems inarticulate. Restlessness overcomes cold; stillness overcomes heat. Clarity and stillness govern all under heaven.\n\nThis speaks of guarding the Dao as one guards a great vessel. If I possess a precious jade cup, I constantly fear loss or damage—thus, if unbroken, it does not wear out. \"Great fullness\" means that though I possess abundant things, guarding them makes them seem few, ensuring they are never overused—hence their use never ends. As for straightness and bending, skill and clumsiness, eloquence and inarticulateness, all stem from humility and caution. Humility has three aspects; I illustrate with one, and the rest are the same. It means that though my heart is fundamentally upright, I constantly examine my daily conduct and every restless action, asking whether it befits a noble person. This is all the Classic intends. It speaks of the noble person holding fast to the Dao with such firmness.\n\n\"Restlessness\" describes a state of agitation, carrying the force of inner heat—thus it can overcome cold. \"Stillness\" describes a state of calm, containing the force of coolness—thus it can overcome heat. This means, in short, that the noble person, in guarding and practicing the Dao, must be deliberate yet decisive, neither restless nor hesitant. \"Clarity and stillness govern all under heaven\" speaks of the strictness of guarding the principle of the Dao. It means that one who rules all under heaven, having established peace, must firmly uphold the established order and not act recklessly. Recklessness—such as altering the principles of predecessors—leads to chaos; not altering it brings peace to all under heaven. This is called \"governing.\"\n\n**Chapter 37**\nWhen all under heaven follows the Dao, warhorses are retired to pull manure carts. When all under heaven loses the Dao, warhorses breed in the wilds. No crime is greater than indulging desire; no fault is greater than coveting gain; no disaster is greater than discontent. Thus, the contentment of knowing contentment is constant contentment.\n\nWhen a wise ruler and worthy ministers establish laws and set forth regulations, when the Yi, the Man, the Mo, and the Bin come as guests, and all under heaven knows no strife—this is called \"following the Dao.\" Battle-hardened horses are harnessed to carts to haul manure; warriors transform weapons into farming tools—this is \"retiring warhorses to pull manure carts.\" If the ruler does not uphold the Dao but follows a crooked path, even mares bred for pasture cannot give birth in their proper place but must foal on the battlefields of enemy lands. This is \"warhorses breeding in the wilds.\" Does this occur? It does. How do we know? When the ruler favors unrighteous courage and admires strength, or covets another’s treasures, warhorses appear. At such times, how can the greatness of the crime and the depth of the disaster be undone? All stem from failing to uphold the Dao and not grounding oneself in benevolence. Discontent leads to this. If the ruler knows contentment, the state and the realm will never lack for resources—what need is there for other pursuits?\n\n**Chapter 38**\nWithout leaving one’s door, one knows all under heaven. Without peering through the window, one sees the heavenly Dao. The farther one goes, the less one knows. Thus, the sage arrives without traveling, names things without seeing them, and accomplishes without acting.\n\n\"Not leaving one’s door to know all under heaven\" means that with thorough consideration, one remains at ease yet never forgets danger. \"Not peering through the window to see the heavenly Dao\" means that with the heart carrying out the work of the heavenly heart, one need not lean by the window to observe. \"The farther one goes, the less one knows\" means that when the spirit is unsettled, sight and hearing become confused.\n\nIt also says that the sage \"arrives without traveling, names things without seeing them, and accomplishes without acting.\" This means that with thorough consideration of the Dao, their kindness extends to all things. Thus, they arrive without seeing things, yet know their names. This is wisdom.\n\nThe reason they can accomplish this is that once virtue is extended, things transform of themselves. As the *Book of Documents* says: \"When the head is enlightened, the limbs are good.\" How different is the heart of the sage in following the Dao?\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine**\n\nIn learning, one accumulates day by day; in pursuing the Dao, one diminishes day by day. Diminish and further diminish, until one reaches non-action—through non-action, there is nothing that is not done.\n\nThose who would take the world do so by means of non-affair; when they resort to affairs, they are insufficient to take the world.\n\nWhen the sage resolves to study the Dao, the Dao accumulates daily. Day by day it grows, and over time the Dao is complete. When the sage wishes to put the Dao into practice, they fear its course may not yet be steady, and so they rise at night and sigh in distress, their hearts worn and their spirits weary—this is diminishing and further diminishing. Only then does the Dao spread throughout the world, extending to all things. The people are at peace, creatures flourish, and the world is upright. Thus, the sage practices non-action, yet through non-action, there is nothing that is not done. Is this not first suffering and then joy?\n\nIn ancient times, when the sage ruled the world, they took the laws of former kings as their model, following them without alteration. They did not rely on wealth or valor. The sage does not speak of violently seizing the world from others; rather, when the ruler can bring peace to themselves and the world, this is truly taking the world well. This is what is meant by \"always through non-affair.\"\n\nIf one cannot bring peace to the world, affairs multiply without restraint, the people grow weary and resources are exhausted, bandits and rebels arise, and heroes emerge. If one then mobilizes troops to suppress them, will it succeed? Not necessarily. This is what is meant by \"when they resort to affairs, they are insufficient to take the world.\"\n\n**Chapter Forty**\n\nThe sage has no constant heart; they take the hearts of the common people as their heart.\n\nTo the good, I am good; to the not-good, I am also good—thus goodness is attained. To the trustworthy, I am trustworthy; to the untrustworthy, I am also trustworthy—thus trustworthiness is attained.\n\nWhen the sage is in the world, they are all-embracing, blending their heart with the world. The common people all fix their ears and eyes upon them, and the sage treats them all like children. As the *Book of Documents* says: \"Spirits have no constant offerings; they offer to those who are sincere.\" How true!\n\nWho would not say that Laozi aligns with this Dao? This means that when people maintain constant goodness and constant virtue, the heavenly spirits always bless them. If an unvirtuous thought even begins to sprout, the heavenly spirits turn away.\n\nWhen the sage rules the world, embodying this to teach the people, do they not model themselves after Heaven? This is what is meant by \"the sage has no constant heart, taking the hearts of the common people as their heart.\"\n\nConfucius also said: \"Not being as good as the virtuous in one’s village, one admires them; to the unvirtuous, one feels aversion—such a person is estimable.\" How then does Laozi reverse this, treating both the good and the not-good with goodness, and both the trustworthy and the untrustworthy with trust? Which is right and which is wrong?\n\nAh! Laozi’s words are extraordinary indeed! \"To the good, I am good\"—this is praise. \"To the not-good, I am also good\"—this is correction. The same applies to trust and distrust. Thus, goodness and trustworthiness are attained.\n\nThose who do not understand his words claim Laozi truly treats all alike and reverses the proper order. They also say that if the ruler of the world has an unsettled heart and acts recklessly, the people will imitate them, and all will follow suit. Moreover, they \"fix their ears and eyes\"—\"fix\" means to direct their attention. They listen to both pure and impure sounds, and their eyes observe both good and evil conduct. The sage observes their conduct but does not wish the people to be so. Instead, they govern with the Dao, always making their heart like that of an ignorant child, strictly adhering to the Dao of non-action—thus the world is at peace.\n\n**Chapter Forty-One**\n\nEmerging into life, entering into death: of those who belong to life, there are thirteen; of those who belong to death, there are thirteen; and of those whose lives move them toward the realm of death, there are also thirteen. Why is this? Because they overindulge in the pursuit of life.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Two**\n\nIt is said that those who skillfully nurture life do not avoid rhinoceroses or tigers when traveling on land, nor do they evade armored soldiers when entering battle. The rhinoceros has nowhere to thrust its horn, the tiger nowhere to place its claws, and weapons nowhere to lodge their blades. Why is this? Because they dwell not in the realm of death.\n\nThe great Dao of heaven and earth generates humanity, fundamentally reckoning by the measure of ten parts. Yet, as the analogy goes, some exceed three parts, hence the thirteen who belong to life. Having spoken of life, why then are there suddenly thirteen who belong to death? These thirteen of death are none other than the former thirteen of life. Why is this said? Because when people live in the world, their excessive pursuit of sustenance—taking what is not theirs by right, using what is not theirs by principle—leads them to harm. How can this be seen? In wine, lust, wealth, and temper; in overmedicating when free of illness or neglecting treatment when sick; in immoderate eating, drinking, and clothing; in excessive desires and reckless fabrication of heretical words; in transgressing laws, courting danger, and losing one’s life; in defying spirits and ghosts, in failing to honor parents or elder siblings. Among these many matters, no one can entirely escape them.\n\nSome say that apart from heresy, recklessness, defiance of spirits, and disrespect for parents and siblings, the rest lead to a peaceful end. How can this be deemed contrary to principle? It is said: by your reasoning, this is precisely why so many meet untimely deaths. Ignorant of the great principle, they are slain by the allure of worldly desires. Thus, the thirteen who move toward the realm of death—what else could this be?\n\nIt is further said that those who skillfully nurture life have two things they do not avoid. Do people not take this as truth? No. The conduct of the noble person is ever rooted in the Dao, their actions aligned with heaven’s principle. With no deceitful schemes in their heart, no sins to ensnare them, how could they place themselves amid rhinoceroses, tigers, or blades? For they dwell not in the realm of death.\n\nThis is likened to the noble person’s concealment or emergence—how could it be so in reality? Moreover, the Dao of heaven favors return. If the petty person indulges in heresy and constantly drives others toward death, the favor of return ensures that though they avoid rhinoceroses, they fall into their midst; though they flee weapons, they die by them. Such is their return, and such is their inevitable fate—all are those who move toward the realm of death.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Three**\n\nThe Dao gives them life, virtue nurtures them, things shape them, and circumstances complete them. Thus, the myriad things hold none that do not revere the Dao and honor virtue. The reverence of the Dao, the honor of virtue—none command it, yet it is ever spontaneous.\n\nTherefore, the Dao gives life, nurtures, rears, nourishes, matures, ripens, sustains, and shelters them—giving life yet not possessing, acting yet not relying, leading yet not dominating. This is called profound virtue.\n\nThese four terms—life, nurture, shape, and completion—refer to those who govern the world and can preserve these four, thereby skillfully upholding the movement of Qian’s primal power. What do these four terms encompass? Nothing else: that which gives life is the myriad things. To nurture is to both generate and sustain the myriad things. Having nurtured them, one distinguishes their kinds, allowing each to fulfill its nature, thus shaping their forms. For those incomplete, one follows their circumstances to perfect their bodies.\n\nOnce the myriad things receive this grace, none are not joyful. As things delight in heaven’s mandate, the movement of Qian’s primal power is harnessed, and the nation’s fortune endures. How could this not be the honor of virtue?\n\nIn terms of the Dao and virtue, the formless takes form. Those who govern the world can sit in robes and issue commands, causing these two forces to revolve ceaselessly, so that the world remains steadfast and secure. This is called the constancy of spontaneity.\n\nIt is further said: giving life, nurturing, rearing, nourishing, maturing, ripening, sustaining, and sheltering—this speaks of the heavenly norm and earthly model, the principle and Dao of the four seasons’ harmonious exchange. In finer detail, this is spring’s birth, summer’s growth, autumn’s harvest, and winter’s storage.\n\nThe ruler should enable ministers and commoners to delight in their joys and possess their possessions, to grow in their growth without self-mastery. Appointing officials to govern them—this is profound virtue.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Four**\n\nThe world has a beginning, which serves as the world’s mother. Having attained the mother, one knows the child; having known the child, one again guards the mother. Thus, to the end of one’s days, one does not perish.\n\nBlock the apertures, close the gates—throughout life, one does not toil. Open the apertures, aid one’s affairs—throughout life, one cannot be saved.\n\nTo perceive the small is called clarity; to guard the soft is called strength. Employing one’s light, returning to one’s clarity, one leaves no calamity for the self. This is called following constancy.\n\nThe beginning is the root, the origin. The mother is the ancestor of all things. The scripture says, “The world’s beginning, the world’s mother.” Why? Vast is the mechanism of the Dao—its beginning, its mother, fundamentally empty yet substantial. Thus, the myriad things emerge from it.\n\nIf one speaks of beginning and mother, those who know the great Dao and can thus ensure unceasing generation will ever guard the great Dao. What, then, is the great Dao? It is benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust—these five are the transformations and practices of the Dao.\n\nThose who govern the world, practicing and guarding these, bring peace to the world. Ministers who guard them become renowned and virtuous throughout the world, and their families flourish. Commoners who guard them live in harmony with neighbors, their six relations at peace, their households prospering without violating laws or decrees, daily earning the praise of their villages as good people.\n\nIf the Son of Heaven, ministers, and commoners firmly guard the Dao, they will not face peril throughout their lives. If all guard it without recklessness, preserving a tranquil heart and calm thoughts, not speaking until needed—this is blocking the apertures and closing the gates, ensuring all responses are measured. Thus, throughout life, one does not lack.\n\nNot lacking means not acting. To open the apertures and aid one’s affairs is to open one’s mouth and release one’s actions.\n\nA lifetime without need of rescue—this means that when one guards the Dao with firmness and releases actions in measured accord, the myriad things follow their natural growth, and throughout one’s life no misfortune befalls the person, nor is there anything to rescue. Thus, \"a lifetime without need of rescue.\"\n\nIt is further said: to perceive the small is called clarity; to guard the soft is called strength. This means that while one may have some insight of one’s own, fearing it is not broad enough, one instead perceives the vast, while what one guards and upholds is exceedingly soft—thus enduring long and overcoming the strong.\n\nTo be utterly humble is to attain the highest; this is what is meant by \"perceiving the small is called clarity, guarding the soft is called strength.\" In this way, what one guards is obscure, yet what one employs is present; great light shines forth in clarity, returning to be one’s own possession. Through such humility, one’s actions are steadfast, and thus one avoids calamity to the self.\n\nBy this means, one rides the constancy of the great Dao—this is called \"inheriting the constant.\"\n\n**Chapter Forty-Four**\n\n\"Were I to have even the slightest knowledge, I would walk the great Dao, fearing only straying from it. The great Dao is level and smooth, yet the people prefer byways. The court is excessively adorned, the fields lie waste, the granaries are empty, yet they wear embroidered robes, gird themselves with sharp swords, sate themselves with food and drink, and hoard surplus wealth—this is called the boastfulness of thieves. How far is this from the Dao!\"\n\nThis speaks of the profound subtlety of the great Dao, likening it to clouds.\n\nLaozi said: \"If one like me were to know the true reality of the great Dao, even if I grasped but a hair’s breadth of it, I would walk the Dao. Yet even then, I would still fear it. Why fear it? Lest my practice be impure.\"\n\nAgain, consider a road that is broad and level, with no brambles beside it, yet people do not walk it, instead rushing headlong down narrow paths. These narrow paths are lined with brambles, where tigers and wolves lie in wait, yet people do not fear them and wander there. Some who pass may escape unharmed—this is mere luck. How foolish! This is what is meant by \"the great Dao is level and smooth, yet the people prefer byways.\"\n\nThose who are not true gentlemen fail to attend to fundamentals: they sweep the hall’s dust with great commotion, yet their fields beyond the city lie wholly overgrown. Another sort, though their granaries hold no grain, clothe themselves entirely in brocade. Still others, who are not good folk, wield blades to feast on lambs and amass wealth without end. The foregoing similes—clouds without rain—all speak of men who neglect the great Dao and pursue what is contrary to reason. How lamentable! This is what is meant by “byways, sweeping, waste, emptiness, adornment, blades, gluttony, excess, and boastfulness—how far is this from the Dao!”\n\nChapter Forty-Five\nWhat is well planted cannot be uprooted; what is well embraced cannot slip away. Thus descendants’ sacrifices never cease.\nCultivate it in the person, and one’s virtue becomes true.\nCultivate it in the family, and one’s virtue becomes abundant.\nCultivate it in the village, and one’s virtue becomes enduring.\nCultivate it in the state, and one’s virtue becomes ample.\nCultivate it in the world, and one’s virtue becomes universal.\nTherefore:\nObserve the person through the person,\nObserve the family through the family,\nObserve the village through the village,\nObserve the state through the state,\nObserve the world through the world.\nHow do I know the world is thus? By this.\nThis chapter is unadorned, a plain recitation.\n“Well planted” describes the firm stance of a thing set upright; though strong men may try, they cannot uproot it. This speaks of governing the world through virtue. “What I possess, I hold fast day and night, never letting go throughout my life” is likened to embracing the great Dao. If one can hold fast to these two things with such firmness, then the sacrifices offered by heaven and earth will continue unbroken even for a hundred generations of descendants. When the five cultivations—of the person, the family, the village, the state, and the world—are complete, the world is at peace, the king is blessed, and he rides the ceaseless Qian-origin.\nThe “five observations” are Laozi’s teaching made clear. Alas, how shallow the intent yet how deep the mechanism! The five observations serve to verify the results, so that the rulers of the world may be urged to practice the Dao. Again it says: “How do I know the world is thus? By this.” This means that when the Dao is truly practiced, the world can be governed. Laozi says: Alas! Do you see? Do you understand? The five cultivations never fail to accord with the Dao: cultivate this and gain this, cultivate that and gain that. The five observations, in general, do not wish the ruler of the world to treat the person as merely the person and the state as merely the state. Rather, he should treat the person as the state and the state as the person, so that his descendants may endure unbroken. This is what is meant by “the world is thus—by this.”\n\nChapter Forty-Six\nOne whose virtue is profoundly stored is like a newborn babe.\nPoisonous insects do not sting it, fierce beasts do not seize it, birds of prey do not strike it.\nIts bones are weak, its sinews soft, yet its grip is firm.\nIt does not know the union of male and female, yet its organ stirs—such is the perfection of its essence.\nIt cries all day without its throat growing hoarse—such is the perfection of its harmony.\nTo know harmony is called constancy; to know constancy is called clarity.\nTo augment life is called ill-omen; to let the mind command the qi is called force.\nWhen things reach their prime, they age—this is called not-Dao. What is not-Dao perishes early.\n“One whose virtue is profoundly stored” means one who nurtures virtue. The comparison to a newborn babe speaks of an infant, ignorant and with its celestial nature yet unopened. Laozi places this first to begin the chapter. Why? Simply to teach men to hold fast to the person and practice the Dao in this manner.\n\nFearing that contemporaries might not believe, Laozi further adduces creatures most fierce and venomous—bees, scorpions, wild beasts, and birds of prey—to confirm his point. Thus he says: the bee can sting with its tail-tipped barb, most poisonous; the tiger and wolf can rend and devour; the eagle and hawk excel in striking and seizing. Yet when the bee’s brood has not yet left the comb, when the tiger’s cub has just emerged from the womb, when the eagle’s fledgling is still bare and featherless—do these possess knowledge? They do not. Their celestial nature remains undispersed, and they are unaware.\n\nLaozi’s intent is that men should guard the Dao and take this as their model, thereby becoming great persons and noble gentlemen. Yet some may still disbelieve, so he draws another comparison: when these creatures’ bones are tender and their sinews soft, their grip cannot yet hold fast—yet it is firm. The Dao speaks of “grasping the method”; the earlier Confucians who aligned with the Dao did not follow Confucius’s learning. Precisely because they cannot grasp tightly, they are without knowledge—hence the statement that they do not know the union of male and female, which is to say, they have not yet known the coupling of yin and yang. Their essence is pure, and thus they cry day and night without their throats growing hoarse. Why? Because, newly born, they do not exert force; their weeping is nothing more than natural.\n\nThis is the harmony of qi. It illustrates that the noble person who guards the constant Dao of nature will never lack in action, nor will he err—is this not like the infant’s crying without hoarseness? Thus it is said: “To know harmony is called constancy; to know constancy is called clarity.” This means that in guarding the Dao and understanding this, one will endure, and the great principle will suddenly become clear without doubt.\n\nAgain: “To augment life is called ill-omen.” The term “ill-omen” here does not mean auspicious; rather, augmentation is not natural but involves forced effort, which is coercion and will bring misfortune. Another comparison: “To let the mind command the qi is called force.” Force arises from qi, and when qi is exhausted, force vanishes. Is this not evident? It means that in all matters, one should not act coercively but remain steadfast. If one acts coercively, this is called “prime”; to be in one’s prime is to be at an end, and to be at an end is to age. Once aged, one must decline; once declined, one must perish. To speak thus is not-Dao. It is said: “perishes early”—“perishes early” means to come to an end.\n\nEnd of Chapter Forty-Seven.\n\nThe wise do not speak; those who speak are not wise.\nBlock the openings, shut the gates,\nblunt the sharpness, untangle the knots,\nsoften the glare, merge with the dust—\nthis is called the Mysterious Sameness.\n\nIt cannot be made near,\ncannot be made distant,\ncannot be made beneficial,\ncannot be made harmful,\ncannot be made noble,\ncannot be made base—\nthus it is prized by all under heaven.\n\n“The wise do not speak” means the noble person can practice the Way. Why? Because when affairs and things have not yet arisen, there is nothing to respond to—though one may know, one does not speak idly. Those who do not understand the great Way, who have never experienced matters in their daily lives, chatter endlessly with others all day, claiming to know and priding themselves on their eloquence. Yet when faced with real affairs, they cannot act. Such are petty persons who have not fully grasped the Way.\n\nAs for “block,” “shut,” “blunt,” “untangle,” “soften,” and “merge”—the first three speak of not flaunting one’s influence, while the latter three speak of humility. This is called the Mysterious Sameness because these few matters all belong to the profound. The six “cannot” statements mean that the preceding matters are the subtle and profound Way of the great person. If one wishes to draw near, no visible form appears. If one wishes to distance oneself, no shape exists. If one seeks to gain, no substance is found. If one seeks to harm, no body is present. If one seeks to honor it, no means arise. If one seeks to debase it, no way is possible. Its faintest trace can be trampled—this is why it is prized by all under heaven.\n\nEnd of Chapter Forty-Eight.\n\nGovern the state with uprightness,\ndeploy troops with cunning,\nwin all under heaven through non-action—\nhow do I know this is so?\nBecause the more taboos there are in the world,\nthe poorer the people become.\nThe more sharp tools the people possess,\nthe more benighted the state grows.\nThe more skillful the people become,\nthe more strange things arise.\nThe more laws and decrees are promulgated,\nthe more thieves and bandits appear.\nTherefore the sage says:\nI practice non-action, and the people transform themselves;\nI cherish stillness, and the people rectify themselves;\nI take no action, and the people enrich themselves;\nI have no desires, and the people return to simplicity.\n\nWhen governance is dull and unrefined, the people are honest and sincere.\nWhen governance is sharp and exacting, the people are lacking and deficient.\n\nDisaster and fortune lean upon each other;\nfortune harbors disaster within.\nWho knows their ultimate end?\nIs there no constancy?\nWhat was right reverts to perversity,\nwhat was good reverts to folly.\nThe people’s delusion has endured for long indeed.\n\nThus the sage is square but does not cut,\nhas edges but does not wound,\nis straight but not overbearing,\nshines but does not dazzle.\n\nThis is how to govern the state with uprightness.\nLaozi speaks plainly here—\nwhat follows, on deploying troops with cunning and winning all under heaven through non-action, is extraordinary indeed.\n\n\"Uprightness\" means rectitude; governing the state is a matter of substance.\n\"Cunning\" in warfare is not deceit—\nit means extending virtue abroad, bestowing bounty upon the enemy,\nso that they admire and emulate, submitting and coming to allegiance,\nthus sparing lives on both sides.\nPacifying disorder and calming the world is what \"deploying troops with cunning\" truly means.\n\"Cunning\" lies in the spread of virtue.\n\n\"Winning all under heaven through non-action\" means refraining from war.\nEven when compelled to deploy troops with cunning,\nthe cunning lies in marching forth with discipline,\nwhere the enemy yields and we stand firm—\nthe army of a true king is cunning in its refusal to take lives.\n\nThe text asks: *How do I know this is so?*\nThis means that by following the great Dao, affairs will surely prosper—\nhence the affirmation *this is so*.\n\nIt further states that when the people of the world are poor,\nwhen blades and weapons proliferate among them,\nwhen thieves and bandits abound—\nthese are the wellsprings of chaos.\nWhen a ruler is benighted, prizing cleverness\nand pursuing emptiness over the state’s true substance,\nthen strange offerings appear at court day after day.\nWhen governance is unclear and laws are ostentatious,\ninjustice and rebellion arise.\n\nThus the sage rejects cunning and pursues simplicity,\nredresses grievances, and punishes slanderers.\nOnce these measures are enacted,\nthe common people enjoy peace,\nthe realm is purified, and customs grow wholesome.\n\nThe text returns to *dull and unrefined*—\nthis means preserving simplicity and non-action,\nso that the people’s customs are sincere and the ruler is blessed.\nIt also speaks of *sharp and exacting*—\nthis refers to harsh governance,\nwhere the people are lacking and the ruler is cursed.\n\nLaozi teaches rulers of the world:\ndo not overvalue cunning,\nlest people mistake it for true strategy.\nIf \"cunning\" is meant,\nhow can those who lack skill endure?\nThough called cunning, it is in truth the subtlety of uprightness.\n\nThe world, not understanding this,\nmistakes perversity for cunning.\nIn this Dao, is it truly cunning or uprightness?\nThis term \"cunning\" has been misnamed by people past and present.\nThus the sage holds to uprightness without alteration,\ndoes not flaunt strength or rely on ability.\nWhen the Dao is practiced, the Dao is fulfilled,\nthe people are at peace, and all things flourish.\n\n---\n\nTo govern people and serve Heaven, nothing surpasses frugality.\nOnly through frugality can one return early.\nEarly return is called the accumulation of virtue;\naccumulating virtue ensures nothing is unconquerable.\nNothing unconquerable means none can fathom its limits.\nWhen none can fathom its limits, one may possess the state.\nPossessing the root of the state ensures long endurance—\nthis is the Dao of deep roots and firm stems,\nthe way of long life and enduring vision.\n\nGoverning people with harsh laws and serving Heaven with prayers for blessings—\nharshness breeds rebellion, and prayers invite misfortune.\nBut if one governs with leniency,\nserves Heaven with proper rites,\nand broadens virtue to pacify the people,\nthen one’s virtue is profound.\nThough no prayers are made for Heaven’s blessings,\nHeaven’s blessings come nonetheless.\nWhen Heaven is so moved,\nits blessings are boundless, and the state is secure—\nthis is what \"possessing the state through early return\" means.\n\nIt also speaks of \"the root of the state\":\nthis root is the ruler’s heart aligned with the great Dao,\ndiligently cultivated day and night.\nWhen the state is thus firmly established,\nit can endure long—\nwhat is \"enduring vision\"?\nIt is the perpetuation of the altars of soil and grain.\nThat they endure is the manifestation of the Dao.\n\n---\n\nGoverning a great state is like cooking a small fish.\nThose who oversee the world with the Dao—\ntheir ghosts do not haunt.\nNot that their ghosts lack numinosity,\nbut their numinosity does not harm people.\nNot that their numinosity does not harm people,\nbut the sage also does no harm.\nWhen neither side inflicts harm,\nvirtue converges upon them.\n\nThose who govern the world well\navoid extravagance, lest they deplete the people’s wealth\nand exhaust their strength.\nExtravagance leads to the construction of palaces, terraces, and pavilions,\nalong with corvée labor—\nthe people abandon farming, resources dwindle, and the state is imperiled.\nThus the analogy of cooking a small fish serves as a model for rulers.\n\nThe four instances of \"their\" in the text are analogies:\nghosts are not inherently numinous,\nbut when a ruler lacks the Dao,\nthey cling to grass and trees,\nmanifesting omens to warn of the future.\nIf the ruler recognizes that omens are not constant\nand reforms his misguided heart with uprightness,\nthen Heaven’s favor may be restored.\nOtherwise, though Heaven does not act directly,\nit will employ those who can,\nand the altars of soil and grain will pass to others,\nleaving no choice but to follow—\nthis is why it says *their numinosity does not harm people*,\nand again *their numinosity does not harm people*.\n\nIf the spirits do not bring calamity,\nif the ruler brings peace and the people prosper,\nthen the ruler’s virtue reaches Heaven,\nand Heaven’s grace descends,\nbanishing all peril.\nThis is what *neither side inflicts harm* means—\nthus the two virtues converge.\n\n---\n\nA great state is the lower reaches of a river,\nthe confluence of all under heaven.\nThe confluence of all under heaven is the female;\nthe female always overcomes the male through stillness,\nthrough stillness placing herself below.\n\nThus when a great state humbles itself before a small state,\nit wins the small state.\nWhen a small state humbles itself before a great state,\nit wins the great state.\nSome humble themselves to win;\nsome humble themselves and are won.\n\nA great state desires only to nurture and protect;\na small state desires only to serve.\nWhen both attain their desires,\nthe greater should remain humble.\n\nIn governing a state,\nvirtue should be profound,\nexpenditures restrained,\nlaws equitable,\nand power always placed below—\nso that the people’s hearts flow like water,\never seeking to converge.\nThis is called the people’s submission;\nthe worthy gather, and the capital throngs—\nis this not a magnificent sight under heaven?\n\nThus the analogy of male and female is employed.\n\nAll things in the world—\nthe male moves, the female is still.\nThus stillness prevails, motion fails.\nApply this Way to govern a state,\nand the people prosper;\ndepart from it, and the people grow poor, the state imperiled.\n\nMoreover, when a great state governs a small one,\nlet it soothe and embrace with tenfold care—\nthen the small state will serve forever, gladly advancing.\nIf the great state abandons this Way and seeks other ends,\nor covets the small state’s land,\nthe great state itself will not endure.\nThis is what it means for a great state to stir trouble in a small one,\nto seek its annexation.\n\nIf the small state keeps to its proper role,\noffering tribute in due season and tending to its own governance,\nit will forever preserve its fief and territory,\nremaining ever close to the great state.\nBut if it suddenly harbors greed,\ndesiring to seize the great state,\nthe small state will perish.\nThe scripture says:\n“I see those who scheme against others’ lands—\nthey are doomed.”\nThose who grasp lose;\nhow much more those who resort to arms?\nI see such acts as last resorts,\nand Laozi’s words are not excessive—\nis this not the decree of heaven?\n\nI know Laozi’s teaching:\nit urges the great to become small,\nthe small to become humble,\nso that strife never arises.\n\n---\n\nChapter Fifty-Two\n\nThe Way is the mystery of the ten thousand things,\nthe treasure of the good,\nthe refuge of the not-good.\nFair words can be traded in the marketplace;\nnoble conduct can be bestowed upon others.\nBut if a person is not good,\nwhy should they be cast aside?\n\nThus, when the Son of Heaven is established\nand the Three Dukes appointed—\nthough one might offer a girdle of jade\nfollowed by a team of four horses—\nit is not equal to sitting and advancing this Way.\n\nWhy was this Way prized in ancient times?\nDid they not say:\n“Seek it and you will obtain;\ncommit offenses and you will be absolved”?\nThus it is treasured under heaven.\n\nThe mystery is the profound, vast chamber\nthat encompasses all things.\nThe great Way benefits and sustains the ten thousand things;\nthe noble person holds it as the supreme treasure.\nThough the wicked may briefly possess it,\nthey cannot long retain it—\nfor their hearts are not good.\nThis is what is meant by “the refuge of the not-good.”\n\nFor example:\ncan fine words be sold in the marketplace?\nIndeed they can.\nThe books of Confucius and Mencius are truly fair words;\nto this day, scholars open schools in villages\nto instruct the young,\nfounding their households’ livelihoods.\nAre these words sold or bestowed?\nYet in households that are not good,\nchildren are not taught by the scholars—\nwhy should the books be cast aside?\nThis is what is meant by “if a person is not good.”\n\nIn ancient times, when the Son of Heaven was established\nand the Three Dukes enfeoffed,\ntheir positions were set, their offices defined.\nYet they still offered teams of horses and jade girdles to summon the worthy—\nhow much better to sit in court robes and practice this Way!\nThose rulers and ministers who neglect the great Way,\ninstead seeking fame to attract the worthy—\nwhen the worthy arrive, what can they do?\n\nWhy was this Way prized in ancient times?\nBecause it does not require seeking—\nit can be attained in the present moment,\ngrasped and practiced swiftly,\nso that past errors dissolve.\nThis is why it is treasured under heaven.\n\n---\n\nChapter Fifty-Three\n\nPractice non-doing,\nattend to non-affairs,\nsavor the flavorless.\nTackle difficulties while they are easy,\nundertake greatness in its smallness.\nThe difficult affairs of the world\nmust begin with the easy;\nthe great affairs of the world\nmust begin with the small.\n\nWhat is secure is easy to hold;\nwhat shows no sign is easy to plan for;\nwhat is fragile is easy to break;\nwhat is minute is easy to scatter.\nAct before things arise;\ngovern before disorder begins.\n\nA tree of arm-spanning girth\ngrows from a tiny sprout.\nA nine-tiered terrace\nrises from a basket of earth.\nA journey of a thousand miles\nbegins with a single step.\n\nOne who makes promises lightly\nwill surely lack trust;\none who treats things as easy\nwill surely encounter many difficulties.\nThus the sage regards even the difficult as difficult,\nand so ultimately faces no difficulty.\n\nGreat or small, many or few—\nrepay resentment with virtue.\nThus the sage never acts as though great,\nand so accomplishes greatness.\n\nWhen people undertake affairs,\nthey often fail at the brink of completion.\nBe as cautious at the end as at the beginning,\nand no affair will fail.\n\nThose who act ruin things;\nthose who grasp lose them.\nPractice non-doing, and there is no ruin;\npractice non-grasping, and there is no loss.\nThus the sage desires what others do not desire,\ndoes not prize goods hard to obtain,\nlearns what others do not learn,\nand restores what the multitude has passed over—\nthereby aiding the natural course of the ten thousand things,\ndaring not to act.\n\n“Practice non-doing, attend to non-affairs”:\nwhen there are affairs that should be done,\nact in accord with the time and complete them,\nlest later there be excessive busyness and no peace.\nWhen there are no affairs,\nalways fear that unreasonable matters may befall you,\nso prepare as if affairs exist—\nthen you will find peace in the absence of affairs.\n\nIn eating, do not overindulge in the five flavors;\nuse plain, simple flavors,\nand you will find them savory throughout your life.\nIf you exhaust all flavors in your meals,\nthen when family resources later fall short\nand the five flavors are incomplete,\neven ordinary flavors will seem tasteless.\n\nWhen facing a very difficult matter,\nif you hastily and lightly attempt it, it will indeed be difficult.\nKnowing the difficulty of the undertaking,\nensure that your planning is thorough,\nso that with one attempt you succeed—\nthen it is easy.\n\nIn undertaking great affairs,\nif you rush to completion, they will surely lack solidity.\nFocus on building carefully from the start,\nlest haste lead to instability—\nonly then will they be refined and precise.\n\n“The difficult affairs of the world must begin with the easy;\nthe great affairs of the world must begin with the small”—\nthis echoes the preceding passage.\n\n“What is secure is easy to hold”:\none who desires long-lasting security\nmust do things that ensure long-lasting security—\nonly then is it easy to maintain.\n\nWhen there are no affairs,\nto foresee and prepare for what might befall you—\nthis is what it means to easily know the future.\nFew but great persons and noble ones,\nholding sincerely to the great Way,\ncan achieve this.\n\nThis Way is easy to learn for those with resolve,\nbut to the petty and irresolute, it seems difficult to approach.\nThus Laozi offers another analogy:\nfragile and minute things,\nwhich people dismiss as insignificant—\ndo not take them lightly.\n\nLaozi further compares:\nthough such things may be fragile or minute,\nonce they take form,\nit is better to address them before they arise.\n\nFearing others might not believe this, Laozi offers further examples:\na tree that now fills one’s embrace\nbegan as a tender sprout, a mere hair’s breadth—\nonly thus did it grow to this.\nThe towering pagoda in the temple\nwas raised one brick at a time, from the earth upward.\nA thousand-mile journey\nis completed step by step, from the first day’s stride.\n\nLaozi warns: do not scorn the small, nor rely on the great.\nHe also says: when someone makes a request of you,\ndo not lightly promise what you may later refuse.\nTo claim you possess something,\nthen squander it recklessly and discard it easily,\nis to invite swift depletion and future hardship—\nthus he cautions: first endure hardship with care,\nonly then will good fortune follow.\n\nThe scripture states: “Great or small, many or few, repaying grievances”—\nthese six words all stem from improper principles,\nand so such things arise.\nIf one can avoid these six faults of excess or deficiency,\nresponding only with virtue,\nthen one becomes a true noble person,\nrising above the common world.\n\nIn all worldly affairs,\nmany begin but falter midway, abandoning their course—\nthis happens all too often.\nThus Laozi urges: guard the end as carefully as the beginning,\nand you will never fail.\n\nThe text is exceedingly unrefined.\n\nMoreover, as Laozi dwelt in Zhou toward its end, he witnessed the feudal lords devouring one another, none heeding the royal mandate, and those who acted repeatedly met with failure. He also saw those who held high positions lose them, and so he set forth this teaching to admonish those in the world who stray from the Dao, urging the noble person to hold fast to their resolve and not presume to elevate themselves against Heaven’s decree.\n\nFurthermore, one first studies and then abandons study—reversing the common person’s aspirations. If one attains such understanding, extending it to all things, then all things attain their natural state, and none fail to be transformed.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Four**\nThe ancients who were adept in the Dao did not seek to enlighten the people but rather to make them simple. The people are difficult to govern because of their excessive cleverness. Thus, to govern the state with cleverness is the state’s ruin; to govern the state without cleverness is the state’s blessing. Knowing these two principles is also a model. To master this model is called profound virtue. Profound virtue runs deep and far, turning back with things, and thus attaining great compliance.\n\nIn ancient times, sagely rulers governed the world through the Dao, simply bringing peace to the people. How could they display wealth, sensual pleasures, and rare crafts to the world, making the people keenly aware? If the people clearly knew of wealth, sensual pleasures, and rare crafts, and the ruler’s fondness for them ran deep, then they would vie for superficial gains, and those who prized novelty and craft would fill the courts and markets, all abandoning fundamentals to chase after trivialities.\n\nTherefore, a ruler of virtue rejects rare crafts, shuns extraordinary wealth, and distances himself from sensual pleasures. Then the people will not contend for frivolous gains, and those skilled in novelty will have no outlet for their work. All will abandon vain pursuits and devote themselves to solid endeavors. In but a few years, pure customs will flourish widely—this is Laozi’s true intent in advocating the simplicity of the people, not to make them truly foolish.\n\nLaozi expounds the principles of the great Dao, desiring that rulers be true rulers, ministers true ministers, fathers true fathers, and sons true sons, so that the constant norms of human relations are properly ordered. Does he truly teach the people to be ignorant, leaving them unaware of the hierarchy between high and low? Is he right to say the people are difficult to govern?\n\nIf the common people know what can be seized, they will devise a thousand schemes, and though the law be as severe as frost, none will be governable. Laozi’s analogy—governing with cleverness or without it—how profound is its meaning? Not so. It means that when the people are cunning, if the ruler governs with cunning and calculation, it becomes a calamity for the people. If ministers use their intelligence to guide the ruler in governance, they become the ruler’s ruin.\n\nThus, the model is to keep the people simple and reject extravagance, calling this \"profound virtue.\" The terms \"far\" and \"deep\" are used to emphasize its difficulty, with frugality as the guiding principle.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Five**\nThe reason the rivers and seas can be kings of all valleys is that they excel in humility; thus they become kings of all valleys. Therefore, if the sage wishes to be above the people, they speak with humility; if they wish to lead, they place themselves behind. Thus, though they dwell above, the people do not feel burdened; though they stand ahead, the people do not feel harmed. Therefore, the world delights in exalting them and never tires of it. Because they do not contend, none in the world can contend with them.\n\nRivers and seas lie in the lowest places, and so they can receive the waters of all the world’s mountains and streams. This admonishes the noble person governing the state: if they can be tolerant and receptive, great affairs will be accomplished. If one does not remain lowly but instead occupies a high position, things will reverse when they reach their extreme—what is high will become low, and what is low will become high. This is the inevitable principle of circumstance.\n\nThus, the sages of old labored in body and mind to bring peace to the world, and so the people cherished and loved them without resentment, and none plotted against them. If one loses this Dao and acts otherwise, misfortune will follow, and people may contend without resolution.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Six**\nThe world all says my Dao is great, seeming unlike anything else. Precisely because it is great, it seems unlike anything else. If it were like something, it would long since have been small. I possess three treasures, which I treasure and hold fast: the first is compassion, the second is frugality, and the third is not daring to be first in the world.\n\nCompassion makes one capable of courage; frugality makes one capable of expansiveness; not daring to be first in the world makes one capable of becoming the chief of all vessels. Now, if one abandons compassion yet seeks courage, abandons frugality yet seeks expansiveness, abandons humility yet seeks precedence, one is doomed.\n\nCompassion ensures victory in battle and firmness in defense. Heaven will save such a one, protecting them with compassion. The adept warrior is not martial; the skilled fighter is not angry; the one who excels in victory does not contend; the one who excels in employing others places themselves below. This is called the virtue of non-contention, the power of employing others, the ultimate alignment with Heaven’s ancient principle.\n\nThere is a saying in warfare: \"I dare not act as the host but act as the guest; I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.\" This is called advancing without advancing, warding off without arms, seizing without weapons, and facing no enemy. No misfortune is greater than underestimating the enemy; underestimating the enemy nearly cost me my treasures. Thus, when opposing armies clash, the one who grieves will prevail.\n\nThe great Dao seems foolish, appearing truly ignorant. If one claims, \"My Dao is truly great,\" it has long since become small. It is said to be \"small,\" urging one to hold fast to the Dao firmly and refine one’s nature to its essence.\n\nThe teaching of the three treasures: through compassion, one acts with courage in the Dao, benefiting all things; through frugality, granaries are filled; by not daring to be first in the world, one does not seek to be first in all matters or to indulge in pleasure, thus laying the foundation for kingship. \"Vessel\" refers to the sacred vessel.\n\nIf one abandons compassion yet seeks courage, they will surely be greedy, extravagant, and cruel. Abandoning frugality yet seeking expansiveness means using resources without restraint. Abandoning humility yet seeking precedence means one’s aspirations are exhausted.\n\nWhy speak again of compassion? It is to distinguish its use from the earlier mention. If a commander can wage war with compassion, they will surely prevail in open battle. Compassionate warfare does not mean refusing to fight; it means having compassion for the lives of the soldiers and fighting only when unavoidable. Thus, in defending a city, they will be unshakable. Even if besieged, Heaven will surely protect them. How do we know Heaven will protect them? Because their hearts cannot bear the harm of war and the loss of lives.\n\nThus, Heaven observes from without, and there are four virtues—I do not know what they are. The wise can discern them, not as omens of misfortune but as the fullest expression of these four virtues, aligning with Heaven and Earth. This chapter speaks of the army of the Dao, upholding Heaven’s mandate to punish the false. The general does not act recklessly but preserves benevolence and magnanimity. The ruler will have no worries, and calamity will be pacified.\n\n**Chapter 57**\nThis ancient teaching is most easy to know, most easy to practice—yet none under Heaven can know it, none can practice it.\nWords have their origin; affairs have their lord. It is only through ignorance that they do not know me.\nThose who know me are rare; thus, I am esteemed. Therefore, the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade within.\n\"Most easy to know\" refers to the meaning of words and characters; \"most easy to practice\" refers to the great Dao and great virtue.\nThose who truly know grasp only the meaning within the text; none can practice it, for the words are profound, and fools do not comprehend.\n\"Words have their origin\" means the text has its beginning; \"affairs have their lord\" means borrowing things as their master.\nThe scripture says, \"It is only through ignorance\" that people do not know me.\n\"Those who know me are rare\"—Laozi thus esteems himself. Playfully, he calls the sage one who wears rough cloth while embracing fine jade, for outwardly humble yet inwardly noble.\n\n**Chapter 58**\nTo know yet seem not to know is supreme.\nNot to know yet claim to know is a flaw.\nOnly by regarding this flaw as a flaw can one avoid flaw.\nThe sage is without flaw because he regards the flaw as a flaw—thus, he is without flaw.\nWhat the noble person does is only to ensure no trace is left. If truly so, others will not know him—this is supreme.\nOne should not teach others to know; if they come to understand the Dao, it is called a flaw.\nIf one acts thus—though others do not know him—he assumes they do and prepares as if they knew, thus remaining flawless.\nTherefore, the sage practices the Dao throughout his life without flaw, for he holds fast to the Dao and governs himself with discipline.\n\n**Chapter 59**\nWhen the people do not fear authority, great authority will come.\nDo not grow weary of their dwelling; do not despise their livelihood.\nOnly by not growing weary can one avoid despising.\nThus, the sage knows himself but does not display himself; loves himself but does not exalt himself.\nTherefore, he discards that and takes this.\nThis speaks of kings, ministers, and commoners who cultivate themselves and act with caution, solely devoted to the great Dao.\nThe scripture says, \"When the people do not fear authority, great authority will come.\"\nThose who rule all under Heaven with violence—at first, the people may seem to fear, but over time, they cease to fear. Once they no longer fear, the nation’s great disaster arrives, and none can avert it.\nCommoners must not daily indulge in contempt for the law, belittle others, or insult inferiors. If one day they violate the penal code, their lives cannot be preserved.\nFor kings, great disaster is great authority; for commoners, the penal code is great authority.\n\"Do not grow weary of their dwelling; do not despise their livelihood\"—kings must not indulge in extravagant gardens or excessive detached palaces, must not secretly venture out, must not favor actors or jesters, must not waste the people’s resources, must not impose labor without reason, and must act in accordance with the seasons.\nMinisters and commoners must not associate with the foolish, stubborn, or violent, nor disparage others’ skills.\nThe text further warns: the ancient sages always prepared for what could be foreseen. By preparing, one knows the potential calamities and thus does not display oneself.\nIt also says, \"loves himself but does not exalt himself\"—if one does not value oneself over others, how can one not love oneself?\nBy loving oneself, one first labors for oneself, then attains peace—this is discarding that and taking this.\n\n**Chapter 60**\nTo be brave in daring is to kill; to be brave in not daring is to live.\nThese two—one brings benefit, the other harm.\nWhat Heaven detests—who knows the reason?\nThus, even the sage finds it difficult.\nThe Way of Heaven does not contend yet excels in victory; does not speak yet excels in response; is not summoned yet comes of itself; is unhurried yet excels in planning.\nHeaven’s net is vast and wide, sparse yet nothing escapes.\nIf the people do not fear death, how can death be used to frighten them?\nIf one could make the people always fear death and execute those who act strangely, who would dare?\nThere is always an executioner. To kill in place of the executioner is to take the place of the great carpenter in hewing.\nThose who take the place of the great carpenter in hewing rarely avoid injuring their hands.\nIn governing all under Heaven, one must adhere to the constant Dao, benefit all living beings, and not favor harshness and violence.\nIf harshness and violence prevail, many people will be killed.\nIf this is truly practiced, it is called bravery.\nOne should model oneself on Heaven and Earth, enact the great Dao, follow the constant principles of the four seasons, act in accordance with the times, and reward and punish in accord with affairs.\nThen the people will receive grace, and many will live.\nIf one asks those who govern all under Heaven: from which of these two do things arise?\nFrom bravery comes harm; from not daring to be brave comes benefit.\nThe text further warns: the Way of Heaven is subtle, detesting fullness and favoring humility. Only the Supreme Lord cherishes life. Whether good or evil, the descent of fortune or misfortune is unfathomable.\nEven the sages of high antiquity, reverent and cautious, dared not be complacent—they found it difficult indeed.\nHeaven does not contend with the myriad things; Heaven is ever vigorous and unceasing. The myriad things follow the seasons and find their peace. The transitions of the four seasons come as if summoned, without expectation.\nIs there planning in this? This is the clarity of Heaven’s Way.\nIf a ruler dares to disdain all under Heaven and belittle the myriad things, Heaven’s decree is not obscured—though not swift, it will surely respond. How can one not fear?\nIf the people do not fear death, using extreme punishments to restrain them is wrong.\nIf the people truly feared death, the state would consider this strange.\nLaozi says: \"Would I not seize and kill them?\"\nAlas! Who would dare, fearing Heaven’s Way?\nKings establish laws and offices, each with its proper charge. If the people commit crimes, the officials hold them accountable, governing according to the law. Even so, there may be errors—thus, the ruler does not pardon transgressors.\nHeaven entrusts governance to the ruler; the ruler acts on Heaven’s behalf to order the world. If he acts recklessly, can there be salvation?\nThis is why the ruler does not pardon errors—those who transgress are thus dealt with.\n\n**Chapter 61**\n\n**Chapter 62**\n\nWhen the people suffer hunger, it is because their superiors consume too much in taxes—this is why they hunger.\nWhen the people are hard to govern, it is because their superiors act with excessive force—this is why they are hard to govern.\nWhen people treat death lightly, it is because they seek too much to preserve life—this is why they treat death lightly.\nOnly those who do not cling to life as precious are wiser than those who overvalue it.\n\nIn governing the state, one must ensure the people are secure in their livelihood. Do not impose heavy taxes or harsh levies, for if taxes are heavy and levies harsh, the people will lack resources.\nWhen the people lack resources, the thought of theft and banditry arises. Once such thoughts take root, they will take up arms and slaughter one another—this is called \"hard to govern.\"\nAs a ruler of the world, do not overreach.\nWhat is overreaching? The Five Excesses are an example.\nIf one acts thus, the people will lose their sustenance. When many lose their sustenance, they will stop at nothing—how much harder will they be to govern!\nPeople treat death lightly because they violate the law and take risks to secure food and resources. Why? Because the alternative is a fate worse than death—there is no other path to survival.\nThe foolish, in their ignorance, believe that breaking the law and taking risks can sustain life. Little do they know it will cost them their lives.\nThus, those who do not cling to life as precious are wiser than those who overvalue it.\n\n**Chapter 63**\n\nIn life, people are soft and supple; in death, they are rigid and unyielding.\nIn life, plants are tender and fragile; in death, they are withered and brittle.\nThus, rigidity and strength belong to death’s company, while softness and suppleness belong to life’s.\nTherefore, when armies are strong, they do not prevail; when trees are stiff, they break.\nThus, the rigid and strong occupy the lower position, while the soft and weak occupy the higher.\n\nIn all the world, nothing is softer or weaker than water, yet in attacking the hard and strong, nothing surpasses it—nothing can replace it.\nThat the soft overcomes the hard and the weak overcomes the strong is known to all, yet none can practice it.\nThus the sage says: \"One who bears the nation’s disgrace is called the lord of the altars of soil and grain.\nOne who bears the nation’s misfortune is called the king of all under heaven.\"\n\nSoftness and weakness, rigidity and strength, tenderness and fragility, withering and brittleness—these are metaphors. What is meant by speaking of life and death is the art of cultivation and salvation.\nIf one knows that softness and suppleness, tenderness and fragility belong to life, while rigidity and strength, withering and brittleness belong to death, does one then understand cultivation and salvation?\nIf one understands cultivation and salvation, then what is the source of softness and suppleness, tenderness and fragility?\nThis is the great qi of Heaven and Earth’s Dao, which all things receive. It depends on whether one nurtures it or not, practices it or not.\nIf rulers and ministers, nobles and commoners alike, employ this Dao—the ruler will govern the world in peace, the minister will fulfill loyalty and filial piety without negligence, and the commoner will see their household flourish.\nThose who go against this Dao—are they not rigid, strong, withered, and brittle?\n\nYet people wish to regulate their qi and blood to sustain life, just as trees, if they endure the warmth of spring and are planted with care, watered and tended, will thrive long.\nIt is also said: Those who govern households regulate themselves by the Dao and employ propriety in managing servants. Then servants will labor diligently, and the master will live in ease.\nWhen a tree’s roots are deep and firm, its branches and leaves flourish, and its trunk remains whole for years. Who does not know that all things must first follow the Dao to succeed?\nThus, when servants labor and the master rests at ease, when branches and leaves flourish and the trunk thrives—this is the result of nurturing and riding the flow of qi.\nTherefore, when servants work to support the household, when branches and leaves draw rain and dew to nourish the trunk—this is the inevitable principle of circumstance!\nHow profound—rigidity and strength occupy the lower position, while softness and weakness occupy the higher. Water is the softest and weakest, yet metal and stone are the hardest. To say that nothing surpasses it in attacking the hard is not to claim that water cannot be replaced.\nStone may seem hard, but if it is not truly hard, water cannot penetrate it. Yet when qi precedes and water follows, even the hardest will be pierced, the most rigid will be softened, the strongest will be weakened. This is the great transformation flowing freely—governance without words.\nLet the ruler of the world embody this, let ministers emulate it, and let scholars and commoners regulate themselves by it—then the world will know no evil.\nThe sage’s capacity is as vast as Heaven and Earth, their great virtue unstinting, their benevolence extending to all living beings—then the world will defend the altars of soil and grain.\nIf the ruler reveres those above and below, if ministers fear the spirits and gods, if scholars and commoners respect the law and honor their ancestors—then ruler will be ruler, minister will be minister, and all within the seas will enjoy peace and prosperity. How joyful the people will be, and how the king of all under heaven will reign!\n\n**Chapter 64**\n\nThe Way of Heaven—is it not like drawing a bow?\nWhat is high is pressed down, what is low is lifted up; what is excessive is reduced, what is insufficient is supplemented.\nThe Way of Heaven reduces the excessive to supplement the insufficient.\nThe way of man is not so—it reduces the insufficient to serve the excessive.\nWho can take from what is excessive to give to all under heaven? Only one who possesses the Dao.\nThus the sage acts without claiming credit, accomplishes without dwelling on achievement, and does not wish to display worthiness.\n\nLet the ruler of the world and all beneath him practice the great Dao—its principle is like drawing a new bow.\nIf some parts are too stiff and others too weak, reduce the stiff and strengthen the weak—this is the metaphor.\nHeaven’s Way detests fullness and favors humility, so the great transformation remains constant, never rising without returning to balance. Where does its merit lie?\nIn reducing the excessive to supplement the insufficient.\n\nIn governing the world, if the state has enough for its needs without excess, then the people will not suffer want. If there is excess, the people will be impoverished.\nIf one can truly take from the excessive to supply the people’s insufficiency, then the world will be at peace, and the kingly Way will shine brightly.\nIf ministers and people do not praise or extol such a ruler, Heaven will protect the state, ensuring its permanence and prosperity. What need is there for empty praise?\nIn this way, the ruler stands above, ministers are content below, and the dynasty endures for generations—is this not constancy?\nIf scholars and commoners practice this Dao, their households will be harmonious, their neighborhoods peaceful, and their friendships lasting without rancor. They will aid the poor without seeking profit—this is integrity.\n\nReconciling great grievances inevitably leaves lingering resentment—how can this be called good? Thus the sage holds the left tally but makes no demands upon others. Those with virtue oversee the tally; those without virtue enforce exactions. The Way of Heaven shows no partiality, yet it ever bestows upon the good.\n\nWhen enmity remains undivided, even if one seeks reconciliation with kindness, the aggrieved cannot release their grievance—this cannot be deemed good. If a ruler can dissolve the world’s great grievances, then seated in the court hall, he may spread the great Dao, rectify governance and punishments, absolve the innocent, punish the guilty, relieve the destitute, and moderate taxes to ensure the people retain surplus without exhausting all they possess. Then grievances will dissolve, resentments will settle, and the Supreme Lord may be drawn near.\n\nIf ruler and ministers truly embody this and prosper—is it not so? Otherwise, if one sits in the court hall grasping the celestial mandate yet oppresses the people to enrich oneself, levies heavy taxes, and exhausts all the people possess—is this not enforcing exactions? The Way of Heaven is luminous and clear—calamity will surely follow!\n\nEven if scholars and commoners act with good intent, though they may resolve others’ strife, they cannot dispel lingering resentment—thus it cannot be called good. If one lends goods to aid others, concealing hardship and seeking no profit—is this the conduct of a noble person? A good person? But if one lends to others for profit, demanding double the principal, exhausting all the poor possess, pressing the destitute with deadlines, becoming like Feng Huan or the Lord of Mengchang—is this the conduct of a noble person? A petty person? In this Way, what bitter suffering befalls the poor! What cruel oppression afflicts the wealthy! Heaven shows no partiality, yet it ever protects the good. Rulers should stand in awe, and the people should act with goodness—then blessings will abound.\n\n---\n\nLet small states have few people, equipping them with tools of ten or a hundred yet leaving them unused. Let the people value life and not wander far. Though there be boats and carriages, none will ride them; though there be armor and weapons, none will array them. Let the people return to knotting cords for use. Let them find sweetness in their food, beauty in their clothing, peace in their dwellings, and joy in their customs. Neighboring states may gaze upon one another, the sounds of their chickens and dogs heard across the land, yet let the people grow old and die without ever traveling between them.\n\nWhen Laozi dwelt in Zhou as its end neared, the feudal lords vied in strife. By the circumstances of that time, he admonished later generations: if there be those who can govern their states, abandoning extravagance and frivolity, devoting themselves to the Dao and relieving the people, Heaven will protect them. The four seasons will follow their order, wind and rain will harmonize, and the people will prosper in their farming and weaving. Granaries will be full, clothing ample, and all will delight in their joys, living out their lives in goodness. Though borders lack defenses, they will stand firm; though passes and barriers remain unbarred, none will breach them. Though there be mighty ships and armored chariots, warriors of thousand-jun strength, none will have cause to employ them or array them in formation.\n\nThe people of neighboring lands, though close at hand, will never abandon their own to go to another, nor will others come—yet it is not that they do not come, but rather that the ruler harbors no greed. If greed truly existed, fugitives would be welcomed, and neighboring states would raise questions—how could it be thus?\n\nIf among the people there are the wealthy, each with tenants who till their fields and offer grain to their lords, should the rich govern with virtue, taking little and giving much, then all will receive grace and remain settled, able to secure their livelihoods. But if the wealthy take without principle and labor without regard for season, their people will uproot their households and flee to other lands. Though the scale differs, the principle and circumstances remain the same.\n\nAlas!\n\nThe Way of the ruler in governing the people is to heed solely the mandate of Heaven—can this truly be verified?\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Six**\nTruthful words are not embellished; embellished words are not truthful.\nThe good do not dispute; the disputatious are not good.\nThe wise are not encyclopedic; the encyclopedic are not wise.\nThe sage does not hoard: having given to others, he himself possesses more; having bestowed upon others, he himself abounds further.\nThe Way of Heaven benefits without harming.\nThe Way of the sage acts without contending.\n\nFor the loyal and trustworthy gentleman in the world, when the Dao prevails across the land, it is not that men suddenly praise and extol him—this is the highest attainment. If others do praise him, it is merely self-aggrandizement. Thus, those who flatter me reveal that my Dao is not steadfast—this is why the unadorned is not embellished, and the unembellished is not false. Those who claim to know me show that the Dao has become artful; if one truly seeks to practice it, one must not indulge in superficial praise. As the saying goes: \"Illumine the four eyes, penetrate the four ears\"—this is not achieved through meticulous scrutiny. If one broadly seeks and inquires excessively, not only will one fail to know, but calamity will ensue.\n\nThe sage’s \"illumination of the four eyes\" and \"penetration of the four ears\" arise from observing naturally and listening without contrivance. For the ruler of a state, this ensures that the people suffer no unjust misfortune, and the nation knows no perverse calamity—thus, the ruler need not be overly exacting, and both he and the state remain secure. When the gentleman’s household and person are at peace, does not all else follow in sincerity?\n\nNot knowing is the closure of all affairs. Do not be erudite among petty men; do not scrutinize the treacherous. Knowledge must be sought from the noble; listening must be directed to the worthy—then household and state will be secure.\n\nThus, the ancient sages did not flaunt their virtue nor claim credit for their achievements, yet all under Heaven treated their possessions as their own. They aided those in need, and by aiding others, they themselves gained abundance. Therefore, the more one gives to others, the more one possesses. Thus, the Supreme Emperor loves life and detests killing; when sages and gentlemen embody and enact this, they succeed. Though their lives end, men never forget them, for their virtue is one with Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Seven**\n*Imperial Commentary on the Authentic Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue, Volume II, Completed by the Great Ming Taizu, the Gao Emperor.*",

      "translated_text": "**The Great Ming Taizu Gao Emperor’s Imperial Commentary on the Authentic Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue**\n\n**Title:** *The Great Ming Taizu Gao Emperor’s Imperial Commentary on the Authentic Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue*\n**Author:** Zhu Yuanzhang, Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty, in two scrolls.\n**Source Edition:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* Section, *Jade Instructions* Category.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to The Great Ming Taizu Gao Emperor’s Imperial Commentary on the Authentic Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue**\n\nI was born of humble origins. When the Yuan dynasty’s Mandate of Heaven waned and warlords rose in rebellion, I could not remain at peace in my hometown. Thus, I joined the army to preserve my life, narrowly escaping death. Before long, I broke free from the control of others, led the various warlords, and secured the lands south of the Yangtze. After thirteen years, I ascended the imperial throne, receiving Heaven’s Mandate to replace the Yuan and govern the people.\n\nSince my enthronement, I have been ignorant of the Way of the sagely kings of antiquity. Day and night, I have been anxious, fearing the weight of Heaven’s gaze. Reflecting on this, I sought the Dao from others, but each held only their own views, failing to grasp the wisdom of the ancient sages.\n\nOne day, I perused various books and chanced upon a copy of the *Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue*. I read it casually and found that several chapters were replete with profound principles. Though the text was simple, its meaning was abstruse, and I could not fully comprehend it. After setting it aside for ten days, I obtained another volume with differing commentaries. Upon further examination, I saw that each commentator held distinct interpretations, leading to such discrepancies.\n\nI reviewed them all and pondered the text deeply. With my own understanding, I seemed to grasp its essence somewhat and wished to attempt a commentary for posterity. Yet, fearing ridicule from future generations, I hesitated and did not proceed.\n\nMuch later, I came across a passage in the original scripture: *\"The people do not fear death—why threaten them with it?\"* At that time, the realm had just been pacified, the people were obstinate, and officials corrupt. Though ten were executed in the morning and a hundred more followed by evening, such measures continued unabated. Was this not precisely what the scripture described?\n\nI then abolished the harshest punishments, instead sentencing offenders to penal servitude. Within a year, my fears diminished. Re-examining the scripture’s words and their application, I saw them like dense clouds veiling layered mountains—outwardly insubstantial yet inwardly solid, their forms elusive, their true nature otherwise. They spanned empty valleys to reveal towering peaks, transforming ancient crags into secluded ravines in an instant. Without understanding its meaning, one wanders in primordial chaos. Yet, once its subtle essence is glimpsed, it is like the bright moon sinking into a limpid abyss or a mirror reflecting true images. Though their forms appear tangible, they cannot be grasped or touched.\n\nMoreover, the scripture states: *\"My words are easy to understand and easy to practice, yet none in the world can understand or practice them.\"* Reflecting on this, how could one not see the moon in water and the reflection in a mirror? In the stillness of midnight, I pondered deeply: the moon in water and the mirror’s image, though seemingly real, are empty and insubstantial. If not projected elsewhere, how could they cast a shadow? Thus, gazing at the heavens reveals the moon’s reflection in water, but abandoning the mirror to touch oneself confirms the reality of one’s own form. This is seeking truth beyond appearances, enabling one to probe a fraction of its subtle essence.\n\nThereupon, on the *jiayin* day of the twelfth lunar month in the winter of the seventh year of the Hongwu era [1374], I took up my brush and strove to expound upon it. Whether this will resonate with the aspirations of future sages remains unknown. Though my talents are meager, I recognize that this scripture is the root of all things, the supreme teacher of kings, and the ultimate treasure of ministers and people—not merely an art of alchemical elixirs. Thus, I have poured forth my sincerest intentions and exhausted my wisdom, hoping to benefit posterity. This is my commentary.\n\nThe work was completed on the *jiachen* day of the same month, and I have written this preface accordingly.\n\n---\n\n**The Great Ming Taizu Gao Emperor’s Imperial Commentary on the Authentic Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue, Scroll One**\n\n*\"The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal name.\"*\n\nFrom the Son of Heaven above to the common people below, those who aspire to practice the Dao must follow a path beyond that of ordinary people—this is the eternal Dao. The Dao is like a road: when one governs oneself and conducts affairs with a heart free of extraneous desires, adhering steadfastly to this path, the heart becomes the road, and the road becomes the heart. To hold fast without alteration is the eternal Dao.\n\n*\"The Dao that can be spoken\"* refers to the great Dao that surpasses others. Once the Dao is realized, its name endures—this is the eternal name, which can be practiced and cultivated.\n\n*\"Nameless, it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\nNamed, it is the mother of the myriad things.\"*\n\nThe Dao’s subtlety lies in its tranquility without name and its efficacy in motion—this is the state of *Wuji* (Ultimateless) giving rise to *Taiji* (Supreme Ultimate). For instance, as the ruler of the realm, the mechanism of good governance resides in my heart but remains unexpressed—who knows what name it bears? Only when enacted does it manifest as rewards and punishments. Yet it is not only the ruler’s heart that holds rewards and punishments; the virtuous and the noble, with resolve, can all benefit and sustain the myriad things. Thus, *\"nameless, it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth\"* refers to the noble person’s benevolent heart nurtured within, which, when expressed to aid the myriad things, becomes *\"named\"*—is this not the mother of the myriad things?\n\n*\"Always without desire, observe its mystery.\nAlways with desire, observe its manifestations.\"*\n\n*\"Without desire, observe its mystery\"* means that once the Dao is practiced, one does not seek external praise but examines truth with sincerity.

      "translated_text": "King and ministers, commoners alike—those who can practice the Dao, steadfastly walking this great Way, must not layer another Dao upon the Dao, nor heap further goodness upon goodness. For all who artfully embellish these two matters, though they may seem fine, last but a moment and are not the enduring Dao. Thus, when beauty is exhausted, ugliness arrives; when goodness is spent, not-goodness follows.\n\nIf one who governs all under Heaven strives only to bring peace to the people, so that they know not the virtue of their ruler—just as the ancients’ rustic elder said: *\"What has the Emperor’s power to do with me?\"*—then:\n\n*\"Being and non-being give birth to one another,\nDifficulty and ease complete one another,\nLong and short shape one another,\nHigh and low incline toward one another,\nNote and sound harmonize with one another,\nBefore and after follow one another.\"*\n\nThis merely reprises the earlier text, hence the use of analogy and comparison.\n\nIt is said: once there is being, non-being arises; once there is difficulty, ease arises; once there is length, shortness arises; once there is height, lowness must arise; once there is harmony of sound, high and low tones must intertwine. Therefore the sage abides in non-action, teaches without words. The sage holds fast to the great Dao already perfected, adding no other deeds—this is called *\"non-action.\"* Teaching without words means not desiring the people to clamorously praise. Thus the following: *\"The myriad things arise yet he does not refuse them\"*—he nurtures all things without claiming ability. *\"The myriad things arise yet he does not refuse them, gives life yet does not possess, acts yet does not rely, accomplishes yet does not dwell.\"* Only because he does not dwell does he not depart. The sage benefits and sustains the myriad things without self-conceit, fosters them without monopolizing their use. *\"Accomplishes yet does not dwell\"* means achieving without self-mastery, allowing things their proper place. *\"Does not depart\"* means he does not abandon them.\n\n**Chapter Two ends here.**\n\n*\"Do not exalt the worthy, so the people do not contend.\nDo not prize rare goods, so the people do not steal.\nDo not display what is desirable, so the people’s hearts are not disturbed.\"*\n\nThe commentary of Caolu is exhaustive; I shall add further.\n\nLaozi’s meaning runs deep. In a state that exalts the worthy, maladies multiply; when rare goods are prized, the people suffer theft. Where maladies abound, though a state may have pure and good ministers and all under Heaven is at peace, if the ruler still exalts the worthy, deceit arises—virtue can be feigned. Once imitated, should such men later gain proximity to power, the pure and good ministers will either meet misfortune or depart. Thus Laozi says: *\"Do not display what is desirable, so the people are not disturbed.\"* In general, if the people know neither the exaltation of worth nor the rarity of goods, all under Heaven is at peace.\n\nTherefore, in the sage’s governance:\n*\"He empties their hearts,\nFills their bellies,\nWeakens their wills,\nStrengthens their bones.\"*\n\nThus the sage always remains frugal, not enriching himself, so the people prosper and their bellies are filled. When the people prosper, the state’s great foundation is secure. Yet he does not rely on the people’s prosperity to strengthen the state, lest other affairs arise. This is what is meant by *\"fills their bellies, weakens their wills, strengthens their bones.\"*\n\n*\"Always cause the people to be without knowledge, without desire.\"*\nThis means, as in the earlier text, not exalting the worthy nor prizing rare goods, so the people see nothing to covet.\n\n*\"Cause the knowing not to dare act.\"*\nKnowing the state does not exalt, though they may admire, they dare not act thus.\n\n*\"Act through non-action, and nothing is left ungoverned.\"*\nAll affairs are first diligently and reasonably attended to; once order is established, then there is non-action.\n\n**Chapter Three ends here.**\n\n*\"The Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible.\nProfound! It seems the ancestor of the myriad things.\"*\n\nThe principle of the Dao is subtle and far-reaching; its use is endless, yet when stilled, it has no form. If one were to exhaust it hastily, it would be improper—this is what is meant by *\"the Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible.\"* And *\"profound! It seems the ancestor of the myriad things\"*—if the noble person treads it, he must do so gradually.\n\n*\"Blunt the sharpness,\nUntangle the knots,\nSoften the glare,\nMerge with the dust.\"*\n\n*\"Abysmal! It seems ever-present.\"*\nIf one’s brilliance is keen and swift, one should temper its edge. If one’s heart is troubled, one should still its disturbances with tranquility. If one’s mind shines too brightly, one should restrain it, yet inwardly preserve that clarity, luminous and enduring. *\"Blunt the sharpness, untangle the knots, soften the glare, merge with the dust\"*—Laozi warns against excess in all things, thus one preserves virtue to extend benevolence.\n\n*\"I do not know whose child it is—it seems the ancestor of God.\"*\nLaozi sighs and asks: *\"I do not know whose child it is—it seems the ancestor of God.\"* The phrase *\"ancestor of God\"* may be difficult to annotate; following Caolu, it refers to the image of Heaven. Heaven is the sovereign and ruler—this is what is meant.\n\n**Chapter Four ends here.**\n\n*\"Heaven and Earth are not humane—they treat the myriad things as straw dogs.\nThe sage is not humane—he treats the people as straw dogs.\"*\n\nThis teaches that in all affairs, one must employ the constant Dao, not wantonly cherish or discard things. The so-called *\"straw dogs\"* were made of grass for ancient prayers; once used, they were discarded. If a ruler governs, does he then treat the governed like straw dogs after governance? If Heaven and Earth unite to form the four seasons, once formed, do they then cease to regulate the seasons? Thus Heaven, which completes Heaven and Earth through the four seasons, endures through all ages without pause or weariness, never ceasing its operation—this is how it achieves longevity. If a ruler orders all under Heaven and embodies Heaven’s constancy, then his governance of the people is not like straw dogs.\n\n*\"Between Heaven and Earth, is it not like a bellows?\nEmpty yet inexhaustible,\nThe more it moves, the more it yields.\"*\n\nThe sage’s heart is ever empty yet ever full, ever cherishing yet ever discarding.

Though it seems empty when gathered and viewed, it is never without potential.

Within the human body lies the heart, and within the heart lies an aperture—this aperture is called the valley. Qi is the spirit; if qi is ever-present, the valley spirit does not die, and with the valley spirit undying, one attains longevity. This is to take the ruler’s body as the realm, the state, and the myriad people, and the ruler’s spirit and qi as the king. If the king embodies the Dao and does not die, the myriad people all find peace. It is also to take the body as Heaven and Earth; if its qi does not act recklessly and remains ever-present within, this is called the root of Heaven and Earth.

      "translated_text": "Chapter Seven:\nTo hold and fill it to the brim is not as good as stopping in time.\nTo grind and sharpen it to a point cannot be long preserved.\nThis is like a man carrying a bowl of water as he walks: if it is full, it spills; if half-full, it remains secure. Moreover, it neither spills nor wastes—thus to carry it full is wasteful and yields little. Hence the analogy of grinding and sharpening to a point: it cannot be preserved. This means that things and ambitions alike must not be taken to excess.\n\nGold and jade fill the hall, yet none can keep them.\nWealth and honor breed arrogance, and one thereby invites one’s own fault.\nTo retire when merit is achieved and fame is established—this is the Way of Heaven.\n\nWhy is it that those in the world who possess wealth and honor so often cannot preserve them? Because wealth and honor lead to recklessness, ceaseless pride, and boasting, which in turn give rise to other troubles that burden one’s person and name. This is to invite one’s own fault, and none can preserve them. Therefore, one uses the principle of retiring when merit is achieved and fame is established as a warning. “Merit achieved” means great accomplishment; “fame established” means the fulfillment of one’s aspirations. “Retiring” means to be modest and not pursue further glory—it does not mean to withdraw entirely.\n\nChapter Eight:\nCan you embrace the One with your soul and never depart from it?\nCan you concentrate your qi to attain suppleness, like an infant?\nCan you purify your profound mirror and leave no blemish?\n“Carrying” means using the body as a chariot and the mind as its reins, with the spirit as the soul. Taken together, body and soul are two things—hence the artful expression “carrying the soul.” In the philosophy of Laozi, the spirit-soul governs the corporeal soul. If one can keep the soul from departing the body, one remains robust. If the soul always abides in the body without straying, this is to “concentrate the qi.” Without aimless wandering or hidden selfish desires, this is to “purify the profound mirror.” With no selfish desires, one becomes pure and undivided—how then could blemishes arise?\n\nIn loving the people and governing the state, can you practice non-action?\nIn the opening and closing of Heaven’s gate, can you remain feminine?\nIn understanding all things clearly, can you do so without knowledge?\nIn conducting themselves and handling affairs, do the noble and the king govern without knowledge or action? They act in timely accord and ensure every action is good. In terms of the mind, they fully comprehend the world’s good and evil, preserving the good while discarding the bad. The noble can benefit others; the king can bring advantage to all things—this is what it means to love the people and govern the state. They do not allow the spirit to become rigid and masculine in its conduct—this is to remain feminine. Thus Laozi uses the breath through the nostrils as the “gate of Heaven,” positing that qi and spirit govern the body. If one recklessly strains the sinews and bones, causing the qi to become coarse and violent, this is the masculine. To harmonize qi and blood evenly is the feminine, bringing peace to the body so that the spirit endures. If the body is not at peace, the spirit will perish in time.\n\nAs in governing the state: the ruler is the master of the people. If the ruler acts recklessly at times, the people suffer disaster. When the people are exhausted, the state perishes—how true this is!\n\nTo give life and nurture it, to give life yet not possess it, to act yet not rely on it, to lead yet not dominate—this is called profound virtue.\nTo allow the people rest and enable them to accumulate resources is to “give life and nurture it.” The ruler does not lightly take from them—this is “not to possess.” When the world is at peace, the ruler does not flaunt his ability—this is “not to rely.” As the population grows, the ruler does not monopolize leadership but governs through the proper functioning of all offices—this is “to lead yet not dominate.” Such wondrous principle is called profound virtue.",

      "translated_text": "Thirty spokes share one hub—where it is hollow lies the use of the wheel.\nClay is shaped into vessels—where it is hollow lies the use of the vessel.\nDoors and windows are cut to make a room—where it is hollow lies the use of the room.\nThus, what is present provides advantage; what is absent enables function.\n\nThirty spokes share one hub: this is the ancient method of wheel-making, where thirty spokes converge into a single hub to form a wheel—hence the saying, “thirty spokes share one hub.” This refers to a spare wheel kept in reserve. For those who possess a carriage, such a wheel is a convenience. When the main carriage breaks down and lacks a wheel, this spare is put to use—thus it becomes “the use of the carriage.” Clay is shaped into vessels: the clay, sticky and malleable, is fashioned into pottery. Those who possess vessels keep spares in case the primary ones break. If the main vessel is damaged, this one replaces it—thus it becomes “the use of the vessel.” The explanation of doors and windows: for those who own a house, doors and windows are fully prepared when the house is built. Anticipating wear over time, extra ones are kept in reserve. Hence the scripture says: “What is present provides advantage; what is absent enables function.” The sage teaches that in all matters, one must ensure both form and void are properly ordered, so that affairs do not collapse. How can rulers and subjects alike fail to embody this?\n\n---\n\nThe five colors blind the eyes,\nthe five tones deafen the ears,\nthe five flavors dull the palate.\nRacing and hunting madden the heart.\nRare goods incite harmful conduct.\nThus the sage attends to the belly, not the eyes—\nhence he discards the one and embraces the other.\n\nThis warns against indulging in desires, abandoning frivolous pleasures, prizing sensual beauty, and coveting wealth. The meaning is not obscure: it speaks of external obsession with hunting and internal obsession with sensuality, of reveling in wine and delighting in music, of towering halls and carved beams. The belly symbolizes the people. To “fill the belly” means that the five colors, five tones, five flavors, hunting, and wealth are all meant to bring the people joy. If the ruler refrains from taking them for himself, he forsakes the one and embraces the other—this is the Way of putting himself last yet coming first, of setting himself aside yet enduring. Wondrous indeed!\n\n---\n\nFavor and disgrace are both startling;\nregard great trouble as you would your own body.\nWhat is meant by “favor and disgrace are both startling”?\nDisgrace is lowly—\nto gain it is startling, to lose it is startling.\nWhat is meant by “regard great trouble as you would your own body”?\nThe reason I have great trouble is that I have a body.\nIf I had no body, what trouble could I have?\nThus, one who values his body for the sake of the world may be entrusted with the world.\nOne who cherishes his body for the sake of the world may be charged with the world.\n\nIf a ruler takes his body as the world, and fears great trouble for the world as if it were his own suffering, then the world will be at peace. Those who cannot do this place the world in peril. Hence, “favor and disgrace are both startling.” The petty man does not seek office, yet when he obtains it, he is startled and delighted. After long enjoyment of wealth and honor, he knows only how to exalt himself but not how to preserve it. When illness strikes, he seeks a physician and guards against the perils of rank as if guarding against illness—then he is secure. Failing this, the loss of favor startles him again. If a ruler is willing to take his body as the world, and the people’s bodies as his own, then the emperor’s body may traverse the realm alone without worry. But if he takes his body as his own and the world as the world, even with ten thousand armored soldiers at his side, he will still fear he cannot defend it. Thus, when the emperor loves the world as he loves himself, prosperity follows.\n\n---\n\nWhat cannot be seen is called *yi*,\nwhat cannot be heard is called *xi*,\nwhat cannot be grasped is called *wei*—\nthese three cannot be fully examined,\nso they merge into one.\n\nThis describes the subtlety of the Dao and its principles. “What cannot be seen” refers to the Dao; “what cannot be heard” refers to principle; “what cannot be grasped” refers to *qi*. *Yi*, *xi*, and *wei* describe its plainness and invisibility. “These three cannot be examined” means that these three are formless yet have form, have image yet are imageless—difficult to describe. “Merge into one” means to concentrate the *qi* and refine the spirit.\n\nAbove, it is not bright;\nbelow, it is not dark.\nEndless, it cannot be named—\nit returns to nothingness.\nThis is called the formless form,\nthe imageless image—\nthis is called the indistinct and evanescent.\n\nThe Dao and its principles are neither overly manifest nor obscure. To say they do not exist would be wrong, for they emerge and function with order. Their mechanism is nameless, as if withdrawn, silent and unknowable. Sometimes they have image yet no image, form yet no form—this refers to the human heart and the heart of the Dao, so profound and subtle that even the noble man finds them hard to preserve. Hence, they are indistinct and evanescent. Indistinct and evanescent: swift and elusive.\n\nApproach it, and you do not see its beginning;\nfollow it, and you do not see its end.\nHold to the ancient Dao to master the present.\nTo know the ancient beginning is called the thread of the Dao.\n\nThe oneness of the Dao and its principles is like seeing what cannot be seen and hearing what cannot be heard. If one holds to the great Dao of antiquity to govern the present, then the present becomes “what is.” The Dao of humanity is innate nature. Thus, “what Heaven imparts is called nature; following nature is called the Dao; cultivating the Dao is called teaching”—this is the thread of the Dao.\n\n---\n\nThe ancients who excelled as scholars were subtle, wondrous, and profoundly penetrating—so deep they could not be known.\nPrecisely because they could not be known, I force myself to describe them:\nCautious, as if crossing a frozen river;\nalert, as if surrounded by danger;\nsolemn, as if a guest;\nyielding, like ice about to melt;\nsimple, like uncarved wood;\nhollow, like a valley;\nopaque, like muddy water.\n\nThose who held to the Way possessed the purest *qi* of Heaven and Earth, attaining divine wisdom and refraining from reckless action.",

      "translated_text": "When set in motion, all affairs follow their principles. When stilled, the numinous spirit abides in the heart, and none can fathom their intentions—hence their profundity and inscrutability. Laozi employs metaphors and similes, while others forcibly impose names and appearances to scrutinize them.\n\nHesitant, as if crossing a river in winter;\nvigilant, as if wary of neighbors on all sides;\ndignified, as if a guest;\ndissolving, like ice about to melt;\nunadorned, like uncarved wood;\nvast, like a valley;\nturbid, like muddy water.\n\nThis describes the noble person who embraces benevolence and steadfast resolve. Others, being frivolous, cannot grasp their subtleties. Thus, seven probing analogies are presented, making their intentions even more elusive—all to urge later generations to cultivate the Way with such unwavering firmness. Yet within these comparisons, two creatures are named for hesitation, and a demeanor of solemnity is shown, mingled with indolence, then thickened with simplicity, stirred by clamor, and provoked by clamor to observe—seven in all, yet their true nature remains concealed. Thus, the sincerity of the noble person is difficult to sway; how could the petty mind ever match this?\n\nWho can settle the turbid and gradually clarify it?\nWho can stir the tranquil and gradually bring it to life?\nIf such a person exists, who can rouse them from stupor?\nWhen the noble person moves, who can still them?\nWhen the noble person is turbid, who can purify them to clarity?\nWhen the noble person is at peace, who can disrupt them with cunning?\nBefore the noble person’s intent takes shape, who can scheme to incite its budding?\n\nThose who preserve this Way do not seek fullness.\nOnly by not being full can they endure, avoiding renewal through decay.\nThis teaches that in cultivating oneself and safeguarding the Way, one must avoid excess. Thus, what decays does not renew, and what does not renew remains unbroken. If it is not broken, how can it be newly accomplished? Therefore, preserving this Way is not difficult at all.\n\n---\n\nAttain utmost emptiness, hold fast to stillness.\nTo attain utmost emptiness is simply to dispel delusion and selfish desire. To hold fast to stillness is to firmly guard a heart of few desires. *Dǔ* means utmost sincerity, truth.\n\nAll things flourish together, and I observe their return.\nMyriad things teem, each returning to its root.\nReturning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called reverting to destiny; reverting to destiny is called constancy; knowing constancy is called clarity. Not knowing constancy leads to recklessness and misfortune. Knowing constancy brings tolerance; tolerance leads to impartiality; impartiality leads to kingship; kingship leads to Heaven; Heaven leads to the Dao; the Dao leads to enduring, free from peril throughout one’s life.\n\nIn studying the Way, the noble person embodies Heaven and Earth, following the constant principles of the four seasons. Thus, they empty their heart to the utmost and hold fast to stillness, observing the cycles of all things—thereby emulating Heaven and Earth. Hence it is said: when all things flourish together, then observe their return. Destiny entails a beginning and an end, never disordered. The noble person who guards the Way and practices benevolence, like the four seasons in sequence, embodies the Dao. Thus, reverting to destiny means: things are born and grow, grow and mature, mature and withdraw, withdrawing to revert to destiny. As the next year follows, so too does constancy. One who knows constancy attains clarity in the Dao. Without knowing constancy or sequence, reckless action brings misfortune. Knowing constancy brings tolerance. *Knowing* refers to knowing the constant Dao; *tolerance* refers to a joyful countenance. When all under Heaven rejoice, impartiality arises. One who upholds this impartial Way and acts accordingly becomes a ruler of all under Heaven. One who excels in ruling all under Heaven embodies the Dao. By preserving the Dao, the ruler meets no ill end—hence no peril.\n\n---\n\nThe highest rulers—people do not know they exist.\nNext, they are cherished and praised.\nNext, they are feared and scorned.\nWhen trust is insufficient, there is distrust.\nThe supreme noble person spreads the Dao throughout all under Heaven, yet none recognize their merit—though merit exists. This is the highest.\nThe middling person, before the Dao is practiced, seeks others’ admiration for their abilities—this is called praise.\nThe lowest person uses force to subdue others, yet fails to win submission—this is called scorn. These truths are evident throughout history, yet some still do not believe. Hence it is said: when trust is insufficient, there is distrust—this is the case.\n\nCautious in speech, as if prizing their words,\nwhen their work is accomplished and affairs are settled,\nthe people all say, “We did this naturally.”\nWhen the noble person acts, they do not seek to display their abilities—thus affairs are settled. To flaunt ability is to manipulate affairs, and such contrivance will soon undermine success. But when one neither praises nor criticizes, affairs proceed smoothly and steadily. Though silent, over time the people will surely praise them—is this not natural? Thus, it is natural.\n\nWhen the great Dao declines, benevolence and righteousness arise.\nWhen wisdom and cleverness emerge, great deceit follows.\nWhen the six relations are disharmonious, filial piety appears.\nWhen the state is in chaos, loyal ministers emerge.\nAbandon benevolence and righteousness, and the people return to filiality and compassion.\nAbandon sagacity and wisdom, and the people benefit a hundredfold.\nAbandon skill and profit, and thieves and bandits vanish.\nThese three are insufficient as teachings.\nThus, let there be attachment to simplicity, embrace the uncarved, reduce selfishness, and diminish desire.\n\nThese—benevolence and righteousness, wisdom and great deceit, filial piety and loyal ministers—how wondrous, as Laozi observes! Why is this so? Such loyal ministers, filial children, and wise individuals first appeared in the time of Cheng Tang and the Zhou fathers, continuing through Qin and Han to the present, yet they remain rare. Laozi’s words imply no other intent but the restoration of the great Dao. What, then, is the great Dao? In the era of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, Yao and Shun, the great Dao prevailed: the six relations were harmonious, the people were all filial, and those who ruled all under Heaven ceded their thrones for the people. What need was there for loyal ministers when worthy officials were already in office?",

      "translated_text": "Kings were unadorned—where could clever artifices be applied? The great Dao declined from the time Yu no longer yielded the throne. Tang was exiled, King Wu launched his campaign—thus arose the need to exalt benevolence and righteousness where none existed, to praise wisdom where folly reigned, and to celebrate filial piety where none was found. Laozi warned men to sever benevolence and abandon righteousness, to sever sagacity and abandon wisdom, to sever craft and abandon profit. Through these three severances, he showed later generations how to end the struggle for the throne, so that ruler and minister might live in peace.\n\nYet if one speaks in common terms—removing these transformations of righteousness, filial piety, sagacity, wisdom, craft, and profit—how could the world be at peace? Would this not be something never before heard? Thus Laozi himself said: \"These three teachings are insufficient in their literary expression,\" for people would surely fail to grasp his meaning. Therefore, he added further instructions, urging men to value frugality and simplicity, to reduce selfishness and diminish desire—these are the matters he addressed.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen**\n*Sever learning and there will be no sorrow.*\nTo fill one’s belly by exhausting worldly affairs—this is what \"sever learning and there will be no sorrow\" means. How wondrous! I have heard that Confucius had no fixed teacher. For the learning of worldly men can never encompass all worldly affairs. Even the most determined scholar knows but three or five parts of them. Yet among all the virtues in the world, whether in the wise or the foolish, though their measure differs, all possess them. Ordinary men cannot master them all, but only the Most High can take the virtues of others and make them his own—thus he follows no common Dao and bears no common name.\n\nThe *Classic* speaks of the \"Most High\"—this is no empty phrase of Daoists. It refers to the highest of men, those whom others cannot equal. Confucius, too, had no fixed teacher, for his learning was vast. When his vast learning was complete, the affairs of the world became clear to him. Thus it is said, \"At forty, he was free from doubt\"—this is what \"sever learning and there will be no sorrow\" means.\n\n*\"Ah!\" and \"Oh!\"—how far apart are they?*\n*Good and evil—how distant are they?*\nThe world’s people are foolish and unlearned, so Laozi set forth these words of \"Ah!\" and \"Oh!\" to warn them. \"How far apart are they?\"—these two words are but echoes of sound. In the space of this echo, one cannot distinguish right from wrong, leading men to speak evil. How could this be the conduct of a true scholar? As for \"good and evil,\" the phrasing merely deepens the meaning of the preceding text.\n\n*What men fear cannot but be feared.*\n*How vast and unending it is!*\nThis is why Laozi was no ordinary man. When worldly men hear of something to be feared, they all know to fear it, yet they do not descend into utter chaos. But when things reach their extreme, chaos becomes profound, and that chaos is without end. Laozi, hearing of this, foresaw the chaos before it reached its peak—thus he was neither chaotic nor afraid.\n\nMaster Caolu said: \"央 means 'to end.'\" *The people bustle and bustle, as if feasting on a grand sacrifice, as if ascending a spring terrace.* *I alone am tranquil, without sign, like an infant who has not yet learned to smile.* This is why Laozi stood above worldly men, and why his practice of the Dao was as such. As for those who indulge in extravagance, Laozi was not like them—why? Because the pursuit of the Dao differs from the enjoyment of worldly pleasures.\n\nThe difference lies in this: the Dao is the principle of the formless, and when skillfully applied, it is never exhausted. Thus one may fill oneself with it without ever growing weary. But the pleasures of feasting and revelry rely on external things and breed arrogance. Once full, they inevitably wane, for they dissipate the will and overuse material things. Therefore, Laozi embraced simplicity and held to constancy—not like an infant’s unknowing state, nor like a heart unaware of such joys, but by upholding the Dao and refraining from reckless action, adhering to the heavenly norms and earthly patterns.\n\n*I ride alone, as if with nowhere to return.*\n*The people all have more than enough; I alone seem to lack.*\n*How foolish is my heart!*\n*Vague and murky! While others are bright and clear, I alone am dim and dull.*\n*Others are sharp and discerning; I alone am muddled and confused.*\n*Drifting like the sea, blown as if without end.*\n*The people all have their uses; I alone am stubborn and coarse.*\n*I alone differ from others, for I value feeding on the Mother.*\n\n*\"I ride alone, as if with nowhere to return\"*—this describes the appearance of one riding a boat, not that he truly has nowhere to return, but that he delights in spontaneity. *\"The people all have more than enough; I alone seem to lack\"*—while others rejoice, he alone seems unmet, as if bereft of joy, like one without possessions. But this is not so—it is his adherence to the Dao. Thus he says: *\"How foolish is my heart!\"* *\"Vague and murky\"* describes his forgetfulness of schemes. The brightness and clarity of others are the ways of common men, while his dimness and dullness are his way of upholding the Dao. Is this truly dimness and dullness?\n\n*\"Drifting like the sea, blown as if without end\"*—this is neither sea nor wind, but his way of upholding the Dao, so that none know where he is bound. The sea is vast; the wind is long and sweeping. *\"The people all have their uses; I alone am stubborn and coarse\"*—\"have their uses\" means all men are as such. \"Stubborn and coarse\" describes the vulgarity of the common and shallow. But this is not to display such a steadfast heart. *\"I alone differ from others, for I value feeding on the Mother\"*—\"feeding\" means to nourish, to sustain. These two words signify nothing else but the steadfastness of cultivating the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen**\n*The bearing of great virtue follows only the Dao.*\n*The Dao as a thing is only vague, only indistinct.*\n*Vague! Indistinct! Yet within it are things.*\n*Indistinct! Vague! Yet within it are images.*\n*Profound! Dark! Yet within it is essence.*\n*Its essence is most real, within it is truth.*\n*From ancient times to the present, its name does not depart, for through it we behold the origin of all things.*",

      "translated_text": "How do I know the nature of all things? By this.\n\nThe bearing of great virtue speaks of the appearance of profound power—if those who walk the Way can follow this as their model, how could it not be the extraordinary Dao?\n\nMoreover, the Dao as a thing cannot be perceived by hearing or sight; it arises suddenly, hence the words \"only vague, only indistinct.\" This is to prevent learners from abandoning it in their struggle to fathom it. It says, \"Vague! Indistinct! Yet within it are things,\" and again, \"Indistinct! Vague! Yet within it are images,\" lest one mistake it for mere emptiness, unreal and insubstantial. It specifically speaks of \"images\" to show that the principle of the Dao and virtue is never unreal. It also says, \"Profound! Dark! Yet within it is essence\"—this is the nature of essence. \"Essence\" is the flower of vitality. If one holds to this without wavering, then its truth aligns with heaven and earth, and within it, the essence is most real, possessing even greater certainty.\n\nWhat is this certainty? From ancient times to the present, the Dao has never diminished, and thus it is said that \"its name does not depart\"—this is immortality. \"Through it we behold the origin of all things\" means that the Dao endures while the myriad things flourish; this is the observation of things. \"Origin\" signifies beauty and splendor.\n\nAnd how do we observe the nature of all things? It is said: the Dao does not lose its truth; it constantly flows through the four seasons, ceaseless and unbroken. The abundance of life it generates is inevitable. Thus, those who teach others to hold to this Dao and act with sincerity are like shadows following the body, like echoes responding swiftly.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen**\nTo yield is to be preserved whole;\nTo be bent is to become straight;\nTo be hollow is to be filled;\nTo be worn is to be renewed;\nTo have little is to gain;\nTo have much is to be confused.\n\nThis teaches one to conduct oneself and act without excess. In studying the Dao and cultivating sincerity, one distinguishes truth from falsehood. Thus, yielding, bending, hollowing, wearing, and having little are metaphors against excess—only excess leads to confusion. For learners, though they may read widely, if they cannot distinguish truth from falsehood, how is this better than abandoning learning altogether? When truth and falsehood are not distinguished, falsehood brings disaster, and falsehood burdens goodness. Thus, how great is the difference?\n\nTherefore, the sage embraces the One and becomes the model for the world. Selecting goodness and rejecting evil, this is the Way. All goodness is unified, while all evil is fragmented. Thus, it becomes the model for the world—how could this not dispel excess and confusion? The extraordinary Dao emerges from this.\n\nNot displaying oneself, one becomes enlightened;\nNot asserting oneself, one becomes distinguished;\nNot boasting, one achieves merit;\nNot exalting oneself, one endures.\n\nOnly by not contending does the world have nothing with which to contend against one. The ancient saying \"to yield is to be preserved whole\"—was this an empty word? Truly, wholeness is restored to it.",

      "translated_text": "The four instances of \"self\" in the preceding text serve but to elucidate the mechanism of the six characters—crooked, straight, hollow, worn, few, and many. If the former is understood in its entirety, the latter follows likewise. Even if one comprehends it fully, it remains but superficial discourse.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen**\n\"Few words accord with nature.\" Fierce winds do not last the morning; sudden rains do not last the day. Who brings these about? Heaven and Earth. If even Heaven and Earth cannot endure long, how much less can man? This speaks of petty men who imitate the Way, yet no sooner do they set their minds to governance than they crave praise—hence \"few words.\" \"Few words\" means hoping for others' approval. As for \"nature,\" it is again a warning against the extraordinary Way. Thus, Dong Zhongshu said: \"Rectify righteousness without scheming for profit; clarify the Way without calculating merit\"—this is what is meant by nature. When righteousness is rectified and the Way is clarified, the rest follows naturally! This \"nature\" is a caution. Who but an extraordinary person could embody the Way thus?\n\n\"Fierce winds do not last the morning; sudden rains do not last the day\"—this is a metaphor. \"Who brings these about? Heaven and Earth.\" Is it not said that even the power of Heaven and Earth cannot sustain wind and rain for a full morning? This is why those who do not know the Way speak thus. Hence, it is said: \"If even Heaven and Earth cannot endure long, how much less can man?\" The point is that those who speak sparingly resemble fleeting storms—even if they arise, they cannot last. Thus, it is stated:\n\nThose who align with the Way become one with the Way;\nThose who align with virtue become one with virtue;\nThose who align with loss become one with loss.\n\nIf one concentrates the will and devotes oneself to the Way, the greatest achievements are nothing short of the extraordinary Way. If one is resolved to spread virtue, one attains great virtue. If one employs deceitful schemes, one inevitably loses oneself through deceit. Why then does the text below speak of three alignments? To further clarify this principle. For example, in this world, whatever one aspires to become, one inevitably encounters corresponding outcomes—this is the verification of one’s desires. Those who favor this receive this; those who favor that receive that. It is inevitable.\n\nThose who align with the Way gain the Way;\nThose who align with virtue gain virtue;\nThose who align with loss gain loss.\n\nYet there are those who are neither fully trusting nor fully distrusting, wavering, and even those who wholly disbelieve—hence, \"Where trust is insufficient, there is disbelief.\" Favoring this, one gains this; favoring that, one gains that. Yet if this is so, why are there those who are hesitant or wholly unbelieving? Thus, the text continues: \"One who stands on tiptoe cannot stand firm; one who strides cannot walk.\" This is reiteration.\n\nOne who stands on tiptoe cannot stand firm;\nOne who strides cannot walk;\nOne who displays oneself is not enlightened;\nOne who asserts oneself is not distinguished;\nOne who boasts achieves no merit;\nOne who exalts oneself does not endure.\n\nIn relation to the Way, these are called \"leftover food and parasitic growths\"—things that others may despise, and thus those who possess the Way do not dwell in them. \"Standing on tiptoe\" and \"striding\" are metaphors. One with shortened limbs cannot stand on one foot; \"striding\" means leaping, jumping, or mounting a saddle before one is settled. Such actions prevent one from standing or walking—what one favors determines the outcome. What difficulty is there in understanding the four instances of \"self\"? They merely instruct one not to flaunt power or influence. All my actions aim only for naturalness. \"Leftover food and parasitic growths\" are forms of boasting. If you boast, who will not laugh? This is why the noble person does not indulge in such things.\n\n**Chapter Twenty**\nThere is a thing, formless yet complete, born before Heaven and Earth. Silent and void, it stands alone and unchanging, circulates without end, and may be called the Mother of the world. I do not know its name; I style it \"Dao\"; if forced to name it, I call it \"Great.\" Speaking of the limitless qi and principle before Heaven and Earth, it is like the unexpressed intent of a noble person’s benevolent heart—orderly within, silent and void, standing alone and unchanging. By its steadfastness and lack of reckless movement, it circulates without end and may be called the Mother of the world. \"Without end\" means constantly reflecting on the Way to avoid loss. If there is no loss, how can it fail to benefit all things? If this Way benefits all things, is it not their Mother? Though it is called a forced name, it is the Way of the Great Ultimate—hence, \"Great.\"\n\n\"Great\" means \"passing away\"; \"passing away\" means \"far-reaching\"; \"far-reaching\" means \"returning.\" \"Great means passing away\"—this refers to the Way’s fulfillment in bestowing upon things. When things receive the Way, it still returns to me—how is this not returning? \"Far-reaching\" means flowing everywhere. Thus, the Way is great, Heaven is great, Earth is great, and the king is also great. Within the realm, there are four greats, and the king occupies one of them. Heaven and Earth share in creation; the king models himself on Heaven and Earth, holding this Way between them. Compared to Heaven, Earth, and the king, how could he be a mere insignificant individual? Why does he occupy one of the four greats? Because he upholds the vast primordial principle of the Way—hence, \"great.\"\n\nMan models himself on Earth;\nEarth models itself on Heaven;\nHeaven models itself on the Way;\nThe Way models itself on nature.\n\nThese four instances of \"models\" merely clarify the four greats—they are said to successively uphold the great Way. Thus, \"Man models himself on Earth\" means that one who rules the world should embody Earth’s four seasons in harmonious succession as a constant principle for governance. \"Earth models itself on Heaven\" means responding to wind, rain, frost, and dew to nurture and harvest things. \"Heaven models itself on the Way\" means being formed gradually by the limitless qi. \"The Way models itself on nature\" means that when harmonious qi prevails, things do not decay—hence, it is natural.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One**\nHeaviness is the root of lightness; stillness is the ruler of restlessness. This is the Way of self-cultivation. In all matters, the noble person must first regard the self as weighty, then assess whether the action will preserve integrity and establish reputation before proceeding.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the four characters—heaviness, stillness, lightness, and restlessness—imply that one should not act rashly nor hesitate unduly. Therefore, the noble person travels all day yet never strays from the supply wagon. \"Travels all day\" means advancing the mind along the Way; \"never strays from the supply wagon\" means using this wagon as a metaphor for the self. The principle here concerns the human heart. The heart is where the spirit and soul reside; if the spirit and soul indulge in reckless thoughts and actions, failing to guard the heart and instead following desires, this is to abandon the supply wagon. It is like a general leading troops deep into enemy territory—how could he discard his provisions and march ahead? To march ahead is to lose one’s supplies, and thus the noble person maintains the self in this manner. Though there may be splendid sights and leisurely pleasures, he remains detached. This speaks to the firmness of the way of self-guardianship: even if I carry a precious treasure along the journey, and someone says there is a fine spectacle elsewhere, inviting me to view it together—this is what is meant by \"splendid sights.\" The noble person only knows to guard his own treasure, maintaining a still heart and desiring no other beauty; thus, he dwells in tranquility, transcendent. How could a ruler of ten thousand chariots treat his own person lightly in the world? Lightness loses the root; restlessness loses the ruler. This principle has already been illustrated: consider the former Zhou King Mu, who rode the Eight Steeds on his travels—was he not a ruler of ten thousand chariots who treated his own person lightly in the world? King Zhou of Shang severed the shins of those who waded through morning ice and carved out the hearts of the worthy—his restlessness went beyond mere impatience, for his cruelty was extreme. Thus, he lost his rule. Not only did he lose the world, but he also lost his own life.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two**\nThe good traveler leaves no wheel tracks; the good speaker leaves no flaws to censure; the good planner uses no counting rods; the good closer needs no bolt yet cannot be opened; the good binder uses no rope yet cannot be undone. The noble person’s Way is such that others cannot discern it, for he makes no boastful claims. He does not exalt himself; having no self-exaltation, how could he utter reckless words? With no reckless words, how could there be flaws to censure? My heart guards the principles of the Way all day; if petty men seek to spy or humiliate me, their approach lacks principle—how could they not be controlled by me? Would they devise schemes or employ counting rods? I possess the world, yet my defense lies at the four frontiers; the people are at peace, things are abundant, ruler and ministers share one heart, soldiers and civilians fulfill their lives and unite in purpose. Though I use no bolts or ropes to bind, who could skillfully open or undo what I have secured? Thus, the good closer and good binder are metaphors for the Way of nurturing the world’s people—then the world’s people become my closure and my binding. Could they be undone? Therefore, the sage always excels at saving people, and so discards no one. He always excels at saving things, and so discards nothing.",

      "translated_text": "This is called \"inheriting illumination.\" The heart of the sage is neither good nor not-good. What is good? It refers to the Dao’s constant goodness bestowed upon people and things, for the Dao is eternally good. As for the absence of goodness, it is the people and things that lack principle which are not good. When it is said that people and things are not good, the sage never intentionally discards them—how could they not discard themselves? That he does not discard but constantly saves them is the constancy of the Dao. If one can follow this Dao, this is called not discarding. \"Inheriting illumination\" means the sage thereby perpetuates his clarity through all ages, hence it is called \"inheriting illumination.\"\n\nThus, the good person is the teacher of the not-good, and the not-good person is the resource of the good. Those who skillfully teach others do not act as teachers, yet enable others to become good. Where the noble person dwells, his heart is good and profound—how can his presence be unsettling? Those who dwell with him in such ease, do they not learn? Thus, though he does not teach the not-good, others become good—this is why he leaves no traces. Do you understand the resource? If one does not value their teacher nor cherish their resource, though knowledgeable, they are greatly deluded—this is called the essential mystery.\n\nNot teaching others yet having them emulate me is called not valuing one’s teacher. Not giving others material things yet having them attain my Dao is called not cherishing one’s resource. Such a one may seem ignorant, yet possesses subtlety—this is called the essential mystery.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three**\nKnow the white, guard the black, and become a model for the world. As a model for the world, constant virtue does not err, returning to the boundless. White is brightness; when it reaches its peak, it must wane, so one first guards the black. Black is the precursor of brightness, thus preserving one’s light without exhausting it. Such a one can serve as a model for the noble person. Those who can consistently apply this are men of constant virtue, whose hearts do not err. Without error, they cast aside selfish desires, unify their essence and spirit, and preserve it within—like the primordial qi of heaven and earth, this is the boundless.\n\nKnow the male, guard the female, and become a valley for the world. As a valley for the world, constant virtue does not depart, returning to the state of an infant. This teaches people to value softness over strength, hence the reference to male and female. One should liken one’s belly to the world’s great rivers, for the Yangtze and Yellow River contain the waves of all streams. Thus, the noble person compares his heart to them, ever possessing great virtue. With great virtue, one must not boast, but return to the guileless appearance of a child. Yet this is not true ignorance—it is merely preventing the heart from reckless action. The infant cannot act recklessly, hence it is called an infant.\n\nKnow glory, guard disgrace, and become a valley for the world. As a valley for the world, constant virtue is fulfilled, returning to simplicity. One who is wealthy yet fears disgrace guards it with severity, thus avoiding disgrace. Such a one can become a valley for the world. A valley is the low, distant place beneath great mountains—likened to the heart, belly, and chest. If one can be thus, then constancy prevails. With such constant virtue, though vast, one does not boast but returns the heart to purity. When simplicity scatters, it becomes vessels; the sage employs it, then becoming a leader. Thus, great governance is uncarved.\n\nWhen simplicity scatters into vessels, the sage employs it. Simplicity is the Dao not yet enacted; when it scatters into vessels, the Dao spreads. The sage employs it, then becoming a leader—not a leader in name, but the lord of men. Nurtured within and cultivated within, when scattered it becomes the Dao, circulating and gathering to return to simplicity and unity. Though said to scatter, it has never truly scattered—hence it is called \"uncarved.\"\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four**\nThose who would take the world and act upon it—I see they cannot succeed. The world is a sacred vessel; it cannot be acted upon. Those who act upon it fail; those who grasp it lose it. These are Laozi’s words of lament. Through this scripture, I now understand Laozi’s great Dao.\n\nLaozi says: \"I would take the world and act, yet I do not act—why?\" The world and the state are sacred vessels. What is a sacred vessel? It is the domain of heaven above and earth below, governed by the state. Thus, one does not dare to take it, saying: \"I see those who scheme for others’ states always fail.\" Even those who rule may fail—this is the mandate of heaven.\n\nLaozi says: \"If I were to act, it would only be when the mandate of heaven aligns and I cannot do otherwise.\" All things either lead or follow, either exhale gently or blow forcefully, either are strong or weak, either are upheld or destroyed—thus the sage eliminates excess, extravagance, and excessiveness.\n\nLeading and following: leading comes first, following comes after. The first is not yielding; the latter is capable of deference. Exhaling gently or blowing forcefully: exhaling gently is slow; blowing is rapid. Rapidity leads to exhaustion; slowness leaves surplus. As with strength and weakness: the strong may prevail over the weak, yet the strong will decline, and the weak will grow strong. Upholding and destroying: what is upheld will eventually not be upheld; what is destroyed will eventually rise again. Thus, one is cautioned not to defy the mandate of heaven with reckless action—this is the meaning of eliminating excess, extravagance, and excessiveness.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five**\nThose who assist the ruler with the Dao do not rely on military strength to dominate the world, for such actions rebound. Observing Laozi as a sage, he stands unmatched through all ages—why? Because of his profound subtlety.\n\nAs a minister, if one does not strive to assist the ruler with the Dao but instead pursues military strength, one betrays the ruler. One should hesitate to deploy troops, lest the ruler’s hesitation lead to inaction—this too is betrayal.",

Thus, the good closer and good binder are metaphors for the Way of nurturing the world’s people—then the world’s people become my closure and my binding. Could they be undone?

      "translated_text": "That its actions rebound means such conduct is contrary to principle, and the divine heavens do not permit it. If one wantonly harms living things without cause, the retribution will fall upon oneself or one’s descendants—such is a principle that cannot be evaded. Where armies encamp, brambles grow. In the wake of great armies, there are always years of famine. This further illustrates the relationship between ruler and minister: what is meant by \"years of famine\"? When a state deploys troops, whether to transport supplies to the frontier—exhausting the people and depleting resources—or to wage war within its borders—abandoning agriculture and leaving fields to waste—thorns and thistles take root. All these lead to scarcity, hence \"years of famine.\"\n\nThe virtuous act decisively, yet dare not seek dominance through force. Having acted decisively, they do not boast; having acted decisively, they do not vaunt; having acted decisively, they do not grow arrogant; having acted decisively, they do so only out of necessity. This is called acting decisively without force. Here, the text again admonishes rulers and ministers: when faced with sudden crises or justifiable causes, they should act swiftly. Having achieved victory, they must not proclaim it—this is what is meant by \"do not boast.\" \"Force\" refers to the excessive pursuit of military strength. \"Do not vaunt\" and \"do not grow arrogant\" both denote ostentation. \"Acting decisively out of necessity\" means acting only when there is no alternative. This is called acting decisively without force—such actions are not taken by choice, so how can they be considered forceful?\n\nWhen things reach their prime, they age; this is called \"not following the Dao,\" and what does not follow the Dao perishes early. This again illustrates that excessive use of force leads to decline—\"perishing early\" means that once decline sets in, it does not last long. In general, one must not habitually pursue military strength without cause.\n\nNow, fine weapons are inauspicious things, and some beings detest them; thus, those who embody the Dao do not dwell in them. This refers to those who, upon returning victorious from war, constantly boast of their military prowess. To claim such ability is inauspicious. Some beings detest them, for wherever armies march, lives are lost, and all things suffer harm. What are these \"things\"? They include supplies, weapons, banners, encampments, bridges, boats, chariots, and horses—none remain undamaged. Thus, some beings detest them. For this reason, the superior person carefully considers and does not dwell in such things.\n\nThe noble person values the left in times of peace, but the right in times of war. This speaks of war as an inauspicious affair: the left is the direction of vital qi, so the noble person resides there in peace, embracing its life-giving nature. The right pertains to metal, which governs killing and punishment, hence its association with war. Weapons are inauspicious tools, not the instruments of the noble person, and are used only when unavoidable. Serenity is paramount; even in victory, one does not celebrate. War is inherently a baleful instrument, employed only out of necessity. Thus, the noble person uses it reluctantly, and even in triumph, treats it as ordinary—this ordinariness is serenity. This is what is meant by \"not celebrating victory.\" To celebrate it is to delight in killing. Those who delight in killing cannot realize their ambitions under heaven. If one boasts of military skill, it is to take pleasure in slaughter—such a person cannot bring order to the world.\n\nIn auspicious affairs, the left is honored; in inauspicious affairs, the right is honored. Thus, the deputy general stands on the left, while the supreme general stands on the right. When many lives are taken, one mourns with sorrowful tears; victory in battle is conducted with the rites of mourning. How profound was the ancient reverence for human life! This is to prevent inauspicious affairs from overshadowing the auspicious and to honor the value of life.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six**\nThe Dao is eternally nameless. Though its uncarved simplicity may seem small, none under heaven dare treat it as a subject. If lords and kings can uphold it, the myriad things will naturally submit. The nameless Dao refers to the great virtue of a benevolent heart. Though its simplicity may appear subtle in the mind, who would dare regard it as insignificant? This simplicity is the true principle; \"not daring to treat it as a subject\" means not daring to belittle it. If rulers and kings can preserve it, the myriad things will naturally submit—submit in the sense that all beings come to offer tribute.\n\nIf the nobility and common lords can uphold it, their names will align with heaven and earth, and they will be deemed worthy. However, to equate lords with kings is an error. When heaven and earth unite, sweet dew descends. No one commands it, yet it falls evenly. Such is the marvelous workings of the Dao’s principle: the descent of sweet dew requires no command, and no one knows who orchestrates its even distribution—it arises naturally from harmonious qi.\n\nWhen systems of governance begin, names arise. The transformative power of virtue is like this: \"sweet dew\" is but one of its names. This echoes the earlier discussion of \"nameless\" and \"named.\" Before the Dao is applied, it is nameless; once applied to things, it takes their names—this is called \"having a name.\" Once names exist, one must also know when to stop. Knowing when to stop ensures one does not fall into peril. Names arise from things, and thus one must halt—why? Because once a noble person completes a task, they must not add further artifice. Adding artifice leads to ruin; refraining from it is called \"knowing when to stop.\" Once one knows contentment, one can avoid danger—this is what is meant by \"not falling into peril.\"\n\nThe Dao’s presence in the world is like rivers and valleys flowing into the great rivers and seas. When the Dao resides in the heart of a noble person and is firmly upheld without forgetfulness, it is like the waters of the Yangtze and Yellow River. When clouds and rain arise in the world and the hundred streams overflow, they all return to the sea—how do we know this? The sea is where the great yin gathers; yin ascends and transforms into clouds and rain. When the Dao is put into practice, it overflows like rivers; when it overflows, it returns to the sea—such is the Dao’s essence and function.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven**\nTo know others is wisdom; to know oneself is clarity. To overcome others is to possess strength; to overcome oneself is to be strong. One who can know others possesses wisdom. One who can know oneself, even in small matters, is deemed good. One who can overcome others without effort is said to possess strength. One who can overcome oneself is truly strong.",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Twenty-Eight**\nTo be strong in this way, one must know contentment in all these matters. One who knows contentment is rich; one who strives with determination possesses resolve. I have my own possessions—if I guard them without greed, my hold upon them is firm, and thus I attain true wealth. Furthermore, one who strives with determination is said to have resolve, for the noble person reflects upon the Dao without ceasing day or night. Having resolve, their affairs will surely come to fruition.\n\nOne who does not lose their proper place endures; one who dies yet does not perish enjoys true longevity. \"One who does not lose their proper place endures\" means that in these matters, if one constantly guards and practices them, their name will endure for ten thousand generations without decay—this is what is meant by \"dying yet not perishing.\" Who does not know longevity? The Buddhists speak of \"neither arising nor ceasing\"—this is precisely it. Yet, fearing that people might remain foolish and deluded, they speak of emptiness and nothingness, whereas here it is said that practicing the Great Dao yields such results.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine**\nThe Great Dao overflows, extending left and right. The Great Dao is vast—how could its principle, boundless and formless, be confined to left or right? All things depend upon it for life, yet it does not speak; its work is accomplished, yet it does not dwell. The Dao’s grace pervades the world, and the myriad things arise by its power—yet once they are born, what does the Dao say? The noble person practices the Dao, taking non-boasting as their highest duty. The reason for not boasting is to not claim credit. \"Not claiming credit\" means that even when affairs succeed, one does not attribute the achievement to one’s own ability.\n\nIt clothes and covers the myriad things yet does not act as their master. Ever without desire, it may be called \"small.\" The Dao is like thick silk, clothing and covering all beings. If it could be named, the Dao’s virtue would not desire to be named—thus it is called \"small.\" The myriad things return to it yet do not know it as their master—this may be called \"great.\" Once the Great Dao is enacted, the myriad things each find their place. I do not claim ability, yet afterward, all things return to me—this is what is meant by \"great.\" Therefore, the sage is able to perfect their greatness because they do not consider themselves great. Thus, they achieve greatness.\n\n**Chapter Thirty**\nHold fast to the Great Image, and all under heaven will come. Coming without harm, there is peace and tranquility. \"Holding fast to the Great Image\" refers to the fundamental essence of the Dao. It also signifies the great position and great name of the ruler, as well as governance. The ruler’s position is the people’s greatest treasure—if one upholds it with constancy and without recklessness, all under heaven will return. \"Return\" means to follow, hence \"all under heaven comes.\" Once the multitude submits and returns, if one governs with care and diligence, all under heaven will be at peace—this is \"peace and tranquility.\"\n\nMusic and delicacies make passing travelers stop. The Dao, when spoken, is bland and without flavor. Look for it, and it cannot be seen; listen for it, and it cannot be heard; yet in use, it is inexhaustible. If the ruler nurtures the people with proper methods, even those who have rebelled will return. \"Passing\" means departing; \"stopping\" means returning to stay. As for the Dao, it is formless and traceless. When spoken, it leaves no evidence and has no savor. One may look but not see it, listen but not hear it—foolish people may think it does not exist.

      "translated_text": "The term \"non-being\" refers to what? It speaks of the Dao’s essence as utterly soft. What is \"the hardest with no gaps\"? It refers to things like metal and stone, which only yin and yang can penetrate. Knowing the benefit of non-action stems from this. It means that softness leaves no trace. The Dao—this teaching of the Master is a teaching without words—is especially refined. \"Without words\" means the Dao transforms things without speech; is this teaching through words? Thus, the benefit of non-action. The benefit of non-action lies in acting without acting yet still bringing benefit. It is not that one does not act, for the great principle is ever in motion. The noble person, wishing to establish peace, never ceases to pursue the Dao. Though silent, their intent is already formed. When they act, it accords with the proper measure, like the turning of the four seasons, responding to things as the time arrives. This Dao is not for the great noble person; even with many words, one cannot teach it, and thus few attain it.\n\n**Chapter 35**\nWhich is dearer, name or self? Which is greater, self or wealth? Which is more harmful, gain or loss? Therefore, excessive love incurs great cost, hoarding much leads to heavy loss. Knowing contentment avoids disgrace; knowing when to stop avoids danger. This is how one endures long.\n\nAlas! How profound and subtle! Shall the foolish think Laozi does not value heavenly rank? Not so. His warning against the greedy specifically uses \"excessive\" to follow the preceding text, then gathers it with \"knowing,\" and finally shows \"enduring long\" as the lesson. Thus, I compare it as follows: Among the great duties of the state, the highest office beneath the king is that of the chief minister. If not by heavenly mandate, can one abandon this to covet the throne? Can the six ministers, without the ruler’s command, slanderously occupy the prime minister’s seat? Examining the order of ranks, all offices are the same. Which is dearer, which greater, which more harmful? The noble person’s dearness lies in daily drawing nearer to the Dao, their abundance ever in the Dao. The petty person’s harm lies in failing to study the Dao, coveting ill-gotten fame, and hoarding wealth. Ill-gotten fame is easily lost, and hoarded wealth, though vast, must be defended—hence heavy loss. The noble person guards their mandated name and stores only what they rightfully possess. This is called knowing contentment to avoid disgrace, knowing when to stop to avoid danger, and thus enduring long—ever unbroken.\n\n**Chapter 36**\nGreat perfection seems flawed, yet its use never wears out. Great fullness seems empty, yet its use never ends. Great straightness seems bent, great skill seems clumsy, great eloquence seems inarticulate. Restlessness overcomes cold; stillness overcomes heat. Clarity and stillness govern all under heaven.\n\nThis speaks of guarding the Dao as one guards a great vessel. If I possess a precious jade cup, I constantly fear loss or damage—thus, if unbroken, it does not wear out. \"Great fullness\" means that though I possess abundant things, guarding them makes them seem few, ensuring they are never overused—hence their use never ends. As for straightness and bending, skill and clumsiness, eloquence and inarticulateness, all stem from humility and caution. Humility has three aspects; I illustrate with one, and the rest are the same. It means that though my heart is fundamentally upright, I constantly examine my daily conduct and every restless action, asking whether it befits a noble person. This is all the Classic intends. It speaks of the noble person holding fast to the Dao with such firmness.\n\n\"Restlessness\" describes a state of agitation, carrying the force of inner heat—thus it can overcome cold. \"Stillness\" describes a state of calm, containing the force of coolness—thus it can overcome heat. This means, in short, that the noble person, in guarding and practicing the Dao, must be deliberate yet decisive, neither restless nor hesitant. \"Clarity and stillness govern all under heaven\" speaks of the strictness of guarding the principle of the Dao. It means that one who rules all under heaven, having established peace, must firmly uphold the established order and not act recklessly. Recklessness—such as altering the principles of predecessors—leads to chaos; not altering it brings peace to all under heaven. This is called \"governing.\"\n\n**Chapter 37**\nWhen all under heaven follows the Dao, warhorses are retired to pull manure carts. When all under heaven loses the Dao, warhorses breed in the wilds. No crime is greater than indulging desire; no fault is greater than coveting gain; no disaster is greater than discontent. Thus, the contentment of knowing contentment is constant contentment.\n\nWhen a wise ruler and worthy ministers establish laws and set forth regulations, when the Yi, the Man, the Mo, and the Bin come as guests, and all under heaven knows no strife—this is called \"following the Dao.\" Battle-hardened horses are harnessed to carts to haul manure; warriors transform weapons into farming tools—this is \"retiring warhorses to pull manure carts.\" If the ruler does not uphold the Dao but follows a crooked path, even mares bred for pasture cannot give birth in their proper place but must foal on the battlefields of enemy lands. This is \"warhorses breeding in the wilds.\" Does this occur? It does. How do we know? When the ruler favors unrighteous courage and admires strength, or covets another’s treasures, warhorses appear. At such times, how can the greatness of the crime and the depth of the disaster be undone? All stem from failing to uphold the Dao and not grounding oneself in benevolence. Discontent leads to this. If the ruler knows contentment, the state and the realm will never lack for resources—what need is there for other pursuits?\n\n**Chapter 38**\nWithout leaving one’s door, one knows all under heaven. Without peering through the window, one sees the heavenly Dao. The farther one goes, the less one knows. Thus, the sage arrives without traveling, names things without seeing them, and accomplishes without acting.\n\n\"Not leaving one’s door to know all under heaven\" means that with thorough consideration, one remains at ease yet never forgets danger. \"Not peering through the window to see the heavenly Dao\" means that with the heart carrying out the work of the heavenly heart, one need not lean by the window to observe. \"The farther one goes, the less one knows\" means that when the spirit is unsettled, sight and hearing become confused.\n\nIt also says that the sage \"arrives without traveling, names things without seeing them, and accomplishes without acting.\" This means that with thorough consideration of the Dao, their kindness extends to all things. Thus, they arrive without seeing things, yet know their names. This is wisdom.",

      "translated_text": "The reason they can accomplish this is that once virtue is extended, things transform of themselves. As the *Book of Documents* says: \"When the head is enlightened, the limbs are good.\" How different is the heart of the sage in following the Dao?\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine**\n\nIn learning, one accumulates day by day; in pursuing the Dao, one diminishes day by day. Diminish and further diminish, until one reaches non-action—through non-action, there is nothing that is not done.\n\nThose who would take the world do so by means of non-affair; when they resort to affairs, they are insufficient to take the world.\n\nWhen the sage resolves to study the Dao, the Dao accumulates daily. Day by day it grows, and over time the Dao is complete. When the sage wishes to put the Dao into practice, they fear its course may not yet be steady, and so they rise at night and sigh in distress, their hearts worn and their spirits weary—this is diminishing and further diminishing. Only then does the Dao spread throughout the world, extending to all things. The people are at peace, creatures flourish, and the world is upright. Thus, the sage practices non-action, yet through non-action, there is nothing that is not done. Is this not first suffering and then joy?\n\nIn ancient times, when the sage ruled the world, they took the laws of former kings as their model, following them without alteration. They did not rely on wealth or valor. The sage does not speak of violently seizing the world from others; rather, when the ruler can bring peace to themselves and the world, this is truly taking the world well. This is what is meant by \"always through non-affair.\"\n\nIf one cannot bring peace to the world, affairs multiply without restraint, the people grow weary and resources are exhausted, bandits and rebels arise, and heroes emerge. If one then mobilizes troops to suppress them, will it succeed? Not necessarily. This is what is meant by \"when they resort to affairs, they are insufficient to take the world.\"\n\n**Chapter Forty**\n\nThe sage has no constant heart; they take the hearts of the common people as their heart.\n\nTo the good, I am good; to the not-good, I am also good—thus goodness is attained. To the trustworthy, I am trustworthy; to the untrustworthy, I am also trustworthy—thus trustworthiness is attained.\n\nWhen the sage is in the world, they are all-embracing, blending their heart with the world. The common people all fix their ears and eyes upon them, and the sage treats them all like children. As the *Book of Documents* says: \"Spirits have no constant offerings; they offer to those who are sincere.\" How true!\n\nWho would not say that Laozi aligns with this Dao? This means that when people maintain constant goodness and constant virtue, the heavenly spirits always bless them. If an unvirtuous thought even begins to sprout, the heavenly spirits turn away.\n\nWhen the sage rules the world, embodying this to teach the people, do they not model themselves after Heaven? This is what is meant by \"the sage has no constant heart, taking the hearts of the common people as their heart.\"\n\nConfucius also said: \"Not being as good as the virtuous in one’s village, one admires them; to the unvirtuous, one feels aversion—such a person is estimable.\" How then does Laozi reverse this, treating both the good and the not-good with goodness, and both the trustworthy and the untrustworthy with trust? Which is right and which is wrong?\n\nAh! Laozi’s words are extraordinary indeed! \"To the good, I am good\"—this is praise. \"To the not-good, I am also good\"—this is correction. The same applies to trust and distrust. Thus, goodness and trustworthiness are attained.\n\nThose who do not understand his words claim Laozi truly treats all alike and reverses the proper order. They also say that if the ruler of the world has an unsettled heart and acts recklessly, the people will imitate them, and all will follow suit. Moreover, they \"fix their ears and eyes\"—\"fix\" means to direct their attention. They listen to both pure and impure sounds, and their eyes observe both good and evil conduct. The sage observes their conduct but does not wish the people to be so. Instead, they govern with the Dao, always making their heart like that of an ignorant child, strictly adhering to the Dao of non-action—thus the world is at peace.\n\n**Chapter Forty-One**\n\nEmerging into life, entering into death: of those who belong to life, there are thirteen; of those who belong to death, there are thirteen; and of those whose lives move them toward the realm of death, there are also thirteen.

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Forty-Two**\n\nIt is said that those who skillfully nurture life do not avoid rhinoceroses or tigers when traveling on land, nor do they evade armored soldiers when entering battle. The rhinoceros has nowhere to thrust its horn, the tiger nowhere to place its claws, and weapons nowhere to lodge their blades. Why is this? Because they dwell not in the realm of death.\n\nThe great Dao of heaven and earth generates humanity, fundamentally reckoning by the measure of ten parts. Yet, as the analogy goes, some exceed three parts, hence the thirteen who belong to life. Having spoken of life, why then are there suddenly thirteen who belong to death? These thirteen of death are none other than the former thirteen of life. Why is this said? Because when people live in the world, their excessive pursuit of sustenance—taking what is not theirs by right, using what is not theirs by principle—leads them to harm. How can this be seen? In wine, lust, wealth, and temper; in overmedicating when free of illness or neglecting treatment when sick; in immoderate eating, drinking, and clothing; in excessive desires and reckless fabrication of heretical words; in transgressing laws, courting danger, and losing one’s life; in defying spirits and ghosts, in failing to honor parents or elder siblings. Among these many matters, no one can entirely escape them.\n\nSome say that apart from heresy, recklessness, defiance of spirits, and disrespect for parents and siblings, the rest lead to a peaceful end. How can this be deemed contrary to principle? It is said: by your reasoning, this is precisely why so many meet untimely deaths. Ignorant of the great principle, they are slain by the allure of worldly desires. Thus, the thirteen who move toward the realm of death—what else could this be?\n\nIt is further said that those who skillfully nurture life have two things they do not avoid. Do people not take this as truth? No. The conduct of the noble person is ever rooted in the Dao, their actions aligned with heaven’s principle. With no deceitful schemes in their heart, no sins to ensnare them, how could they place themselves amid rhinoceroses, tigers, or blades? For they dwell not in the realm of death.\n\nThis is likened to the noble person’s concealment or emergence—how could it be so in reality? Moreover, the Dao of heaven favors return. If the petty person indulges in heresy and constantly drives others toward death, the favor of return ensures that though they avoid rhinoceroses, they fall into their midst; though they flee weapons, they die by them. Such is their return, and such is their inevitable fate—all are those who move toward the realm of death.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Three**\n\nThe Dao gives them life, virtue nurtures them, things shape them, and circumstances complete them. Thus, the myriad things hold none that do not revere the Dao and honor virtue. The reverence of the Dao, the honor of virtue—none command it, yet it is ever spontaneous.\n\nTherefore, the Dao gives life, nurtures, rears, nourishes, matures, ripens, sustains, and shelters them—giving life yet not possessing, acting yet not relying, leading yet not dominating. This is called profound virtue.\n\nThese four terms—life, nurture, shape, and completion—refer to those who govern the world and can preserve these four, thereby skillfully upholding the movement of Qian’s primal power. What do these four terms encompass? Nothing else: that which gives life is the myriad things. To nurture is to both generate and sustain the myriad things. Having nurtured them, one distinguishes their kinds, allowing each to fulfill its nature, thus shaping their forms. For those incomplete, one follows their circumstances to perfect their bodies.\n\nOnce the myriad things receive this grace, none are not joyful. As things delight in heaven’s mandate, the movement of Qian’s primal power is harnessed, and the nation’s fortune endures. How could this not be the honor of virtue?\n\nIn terms of the Dao and virtue, the formless takes form. Those who govern the world can sit in robes and issue commands, causing these two forces to revolve ceaselessly, so that the world remains steadfast and secure. This is called the constancy of spontaneity.\n\nIt is further said: giving life, nurturing, rearing, nourishing, maturing, ripening, sustaining, and sheltering—this speaks of the heavenly norm and earthly model, the principle and Dao of the four seasons’ harmonious exchange. In finer detail, this is spring’s birth, summer’s growth, autumn’s harvest, and winter’s storage.\n\nThe ruler should enable ministers and commoners to delight in their joys and possess their possessions, to grow in their growth without self-mastery. Appointing officials to govern them—this is profound virtue.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Four**\n\nThe world has a beginning, which serves as the world’s mother. Having attained the mother, one knows the child; having known the child, one again guards the mother. Thus, to the end of one’s days, one does not perish.\n\nBlock the apertures, close the gates—throughout life, one does not toil. Open the apertures, aid one’s affairs—throughout life, one cannot be saved.\n\nTo perceive the small is called clarity; to guard the soft is called strength. Employing one’s light, returning to one’s clarity, one leaves no calamity for the self. This is called following constancy.\n\nThe beginning is the root, the origin. The mother is the ancestor of all things. The scripture says, “The world’s beginning, the world’s mother.” Why? Vast is the mechanism of the Dao—its beginning, its mother, fundamentally empty yet substantial. Thus, the myriad things emerge from it.\n\nIf one speaks of beginning and mother, those who know the great Dao and can thus ensure unceasing generation will ever guard the great Dao. What, then, is the great Dao? It is benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust—these five are the transformations and practices of the Dao.\n\nThose who govern the world, practicing and guarding these, bring peace to the world. Ministers who guard them become renowned and virtuous throughout the world, and their families flourish. Commoners who guard them live in harmony with neighbors, their six relations at peace, their households prospering without violating laws or decrees, daily earning the praise of their villages as good people.\n\nIf the Son of Heaven, ministers, and commoners firmly guard the Dao, they will not face peril throughout their lives. If all guard it without recklessness, preserving a tranquil heart and calm thoughts, not speaking until needed—this is blocking the apertures and closing the gates, ensuring all responses are measured. Thus, throughout life, one does not lack.\n\nNot lacking means not acting. To open the apertures and aid one’s affairs is to open one’s mouth and release one’s actions.",

Thus, \"a lifetime without need of rescue.\"\n\nIt is further said: to perceive the small is called clarity; to guard the soft is called strength.

Yet even then, I would still fear it. Why fear it? Lest my practice be impure.\"\n\nAgain, consider a road that is broad and level, with no brambles beside it, yet people do not walk it, instead rushing headlong down narrow paths.

      "translated_text": "Those who are not true gentlemen fail to attend to fundamentals: they sweep the hall’s dust with great commotion, yet their fields beyond the city lie wholly overgrown. Another sort, though their granaries hold no grain, clothe themselves entirely in brocade. Still others, who are not good folk, wield blades to feast on lambs and amass wealth without end. The foregoing similes—clouds without rain—all speak of men who neglect the great Dao and pursue what is contrary to reason. How lamentable! This is what is meant by “byways, sweeping, waste, emptiness, adornment, blades, gluttony, excess, and boastfulness—how far is this from the Dao!”\n\nChapter Forty-Five\nWhat is well planted cannot be uprooted; what is well embraced cannot slip away. Thus descendants’ sacrifices never cease.\nCultivate it in the person, and one’s virtue becomes true.\nCultivate it in the family, and one’s virtue becomes abundant.\nCultivate it in the village, and one’s virtue becomes enduring.\nCultivate it in the state, and one’s virtue becomes ample.\nCultivate it in the world, and one’s virtue becomes universal.\nTherefore:\nObserve the person through the person,\nObserve the family through the family,\nObserve the village through the village,\nObserve the state through the state,\nObserve the world through the world.\nHow do I know the world is thus? By this.\nThis chapter is unadorned, a plain recitation.\n“Well planted” describes the firm stance of a thing set upright; though strong men may try, they cannot uproot it. This speaks of governing the world through virtue. “What I possess, I hold fast day and night, never letting go throughout my life” is likened to embracing the great Dao. If one can hold fast to these two things with such firmness, then the sacrifices offered by heaven and earth will continue unbroken even for a hundred generations of descendants. When the five cultivations—of the person, the family, the village, the state, and the world—are complete, the world is at peace, the king is blessed, and he rides the ceaseless Qian-origin.\nThe “five observations” are Laozi’s teaching made clear. Alas, how shallow the intent yet how deep the mechanism! The five observations serve to verify the results, so that the rulers of the world may be urged to practice the Dao. Again it says: “How do I know the world is thus? By this.” This means that when the Dao is truly practiced, the world can be governed. Laozi says: Alas! Do you see? Do you understand? The five cultivations never fail to accord with the Dao: cultivate this and gain this, cultivate that and gain that. The five observations, in general, do not wish the ruler of the world to treat the person as merely the person and the state as merely the state. Rather, he should treat the person as the state and the state as the person, so that his descendants may endure unbroken. This is what is meant by “the world is thus—by this.”\n\nChapter Forty-Six\nOne whose virtue is profoundly stored is like a newborn babe.\nPoisonous insects do not sting it, fierce beasts do not seize it, birds of prey do not strike it.\nIts bones are weak, its sinews soft, yet its grip is firm.\nIt does not know the union of male and female, yet its organ stirs—such is the perfection of its essence.\nIt cries all day without its throat growing hoarse—such is the perfection of its harmony.\nTo know harmony is called constancy; to know constancy is called clarity.\nTo augment life is called ill-omen; to let the mind command the qi is called force.\nWhen things reach their prime, they age—this is called not-Dao. What is not-Dao perishes early.\n“One whose virtue is profoundly stored” means one who nurtures virtue. The comparison to a newborn babe speaks of an infant, ignorant and with its celestial nature yet unopened. Laozi places this first to begin the chapter. Why? Simply to teach men to hold fast to the person and practice the Dao in this manner.",

This is what is meant by \"the great Dao is level and smooth, yet the people prefer byways.\"",

      "translated_text": "Fearing that contemporaries might not believe, Laozi further adduces creatures most fierce and venomous—bees, scorpions, wild beasts, and birds of prey—to confirm his point. Thus he says: the bee can sting with its tail-tipped barb, most poisonous; the tiger and wolf can rend and devour; the eagle and hawk excel in striking and seizing. Yet when the bee’s brood has not yet left the comb, when the tiger’s cub has just emerged from the womb, when the eagle’s fledgling is still bare and featherless—do these possess knowledge? They do not. Their celestial nature remains undispersed, and they are unaware.\n\nLaozi’s intent is that men should guard the Dao and take this as their model, thereby becoming great persons and noble gentlemen. Yet some may still disbelieve, so he draws another comparison: when these creatures’ bones are tender and their sinews soft, their grip cannot yet hold fast—yet it is firm. The Dao speaks of “grasping the method”; the earlier Confucians who aligned with the Dao did not follow Confucius’s learning. Precisely because they cannot grasp tightly, they are without knowledge—hence the statement that they do not know the union of male and female, which is to say, they have not yet known the coupling of yin and yang. Their essence is pure, and thus they cry day and night without their throats growing hoarse. Why? Because, newly born, they do not exert force; their weeping is nothing more than natural.\n\nThis is the harmony of qi. It illustrates that the noble person who guards the constant Dao of nature will never lack in action, nor will he err—is this not like the infant’s crying without hoarseness? Thus it is said: “To know harmony is called constancy; to know constancy is called clarity.” This means that in guarding the Dao and understanding this, one will endure, and the great principle will suddenly become clear without doubt.\n\nAgain: “To augment life is called ill-omen.” The term “ill-omen” here does not mean auspicious; rather, augmentation is not natural but involves forced effort, which is coercion and will bring misfortune. Another comparison: “To let the mind command the qi is called force.” Force arises from qi, and when qi is exhausted, force vanishes. Is this not evident? It means that in all matters, one should not act coercively but remain steadfast. If one acts coercively, this is called “prime”; to be in one’s prime is to be at an end, and to be at an end is to age. Once aged, one must decline; once declined, one must perish. To speak thus is not-Dao. It is said: “perishes early”—“perishes early” means to come to an end.\n\nEnd of Chapter Forty-Seven.",

through non-action, is extraordinary indeed.\n\n\"Uprightness\" means rectitude; governing the state is a matter of substance.\n\"Cunning\" in warfare is not deceit—\nit means extending virtue abroad, bestowing bounty upon the enemy,\nso that they admire and emulate, submitting and coming to allegiance,\nthus sparing lives on both sides.\nPacifying disorder and calming the world is what \"deploying troops with cunning\" truly means.\n\"Cunning\" lies in the spread of virtue.\n\n\"Winning all under heaven through non-action\" means refraining from war.\nEven when compelled to deploy troops with cunning,\nthe cunning lies in marching forth with discipline,\nwhere the enemy yields and we stand firm—\nthe army of a true king is cunning in its refusal to take lives.\n\nThe text asks: *How do I know this is so?*\nThis means that by following the great Dao, affairs will surely prosper—\nhence the affirmation *this is so*.\n\nIt further states that when the people of the world are poor,\nwhen blades and weapons proliferate among them,\nwhen thieves and bandits abound—\nthese are the wellsprings of chaos.\nWhen a ruler is benighted, prizing cleverness\nand pursuing emptiness over the state’s true substance,\nthen strange offerings appear at court day after day.\nWhen governance is unclear and laws are ostentatious,\ninjustice and rebellion arise.\n\nThus the sage rejects cunning and pursues simplicity,\nredresses grievances, and punishes slanderers.\nOnce these measures are enacted,\nthe common people enjoy peace,\nthe realm is purified, and customs grow wholesome.\n\nThe text returns to *dull and unrefined*—\nthis means preserving simplicity and non-action,\nso that the people’s customs are sincere and the ruler is blessed.\nIt also speaks of *sharp and

strategy.\nIf \"cunning\" is meant,\nhow can those who lack skill endure?\nThough called cunning, it is in truth the subtlety of uprightness.\n\nThe world, not understanding this,\nmistakes perversity for cunning.\nIn this Dao, is it truly cunning or uprightness?\nThis term \"cunning\" has been misnamed by people past and present.\nThus the sage holds to uprightness without alteration,\ndoes not flaunt strength or rely on ability.\nWhen the Dao is practiced, the Dao is fulfilled,\nthe people are at peace, and all things flourish.\n\n---\n\nTo govern people and serve Heaven, nothing surpasses frugality.\nOnly through frugality can one return early.\nEarly return is called the accumulation of virtue;\naccumulating virtue ensures nothing is unconquerable.\nNothing unconquerable means none can fathom its limits.\nWhen none can fathom its limits, one may possess the state.\nPossessing the root of the state ensures long endurance—\nthis is the Dao of deep roots and firm stems,\nthe way of long life and enduring vision.\n\nGoverning people with harsh laws and serving Heaven with prayers for blessings—\nharshness breeds rebellion, and prayers invite misfortune.\nBut if one governs with leniency,\nserves Heaven with proper rites,\nand broadens virtue to pacify the people,\nthen one’s virtue is profound.\nThough no prayers are made for Heaven’s blessings,\nHeaven’s blessings come nonetheless.\nWhen Heaven is so moved,\nits blessings are boundless, and the state is secure—\nthis is what \"possessing the state through early return\" means.\n\nIt also speaks of \"the root of the state\":\nthis root is the ruler’s heart aligned with the great Dao,\ndiligently cultivated day and night.\nWhen the state is thus firmly established,\nit can endure long—\nwhat is \"enduring vision\"?\nIt is the perpetuation of the altars of soil and grain.\nThat they endure is the manifestation of the Dao.\n\n---\n\nGoverning a great state is like cooking a small fish.\nThose who oversee the world with the Dao—\ntheir ghosts do not haunt.\nNot that their ghosts lack numinosity,\nbut their numinosity does not harm people.\nNot that their numinosity does not harm people,\nbut the sage also does no harm.\nWhen neither side inflicts harm,\nvirtue converges upon them.\n\nThose who govern the world well\navoid extravagance, lest they deplete the people’s wealth\nand exhaust their strength.\nExtravagance leads to the construction of palaces, terraces, and pavilions,\nalong with corvée labor—\nthe people abandon farming, resources dwindle, and the state is imperiled.\nThus the analogy of cooking a small fish serves as a model for rulers.\n\nThe four instances of \"their\" in the text are analogies:\nghosts are not inherently numinous,\nbut when a ruler lacks the Dao,\nthey cling to grass and trees,\nmanifesting omens to warn of the future.\nIf the ruler recognizes that omens are not constant\nand reforms his misguided heart with uprightness,\nthen Heaven’s favor may be restored.\nOtherwise, though Heaven does not act directly,\nit will employ those who can,\nand the altars of soil and grain will pass to others,\nleaving no choice but to follow—\nthis is why it says *their numinosity does not harm people*,\nand again *their numinosity does not harm people*.\n\nIf the spirits do not bring calamity,\nif the ruler brings peace and the people prosper,\nthen the ruler’s virtue reaches Heaven,\nand Heaven’s grace descends,\nbanishing all peril.\nThis is what *neither side inflicts harm* means—\nthus the two virtues converge.\n\n---\n\nA great state is the

      "translated_text": "The text is exceedingly unrefined.\n\nMoreover, as Laozi dwelt in Zhou toward its end, he witnessed the feudal lords devouring one another, none heeding the royal mandate, and those who acted repeatedly met with failure. He also saw those who held high positions lose them, and so he set forth this teaching to admonish those in the world who stray from the Dao, urging the noble person to hold fast to their resolve and not presume to elevate themselves against Heaven’s decree.\n\nFurthermore, one first studies and then abandons study—reversing the common person’s aspirations. If one attains such understanding, extending it to all things, then all things attain their natural state, and none fail to be transformed.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Four**\nThe ancients who were adept in the Dao did not seek to enlighten the people but rather to make them simple. The people are difficult to govern because of their excessive cleverness. Thus, to govern the state with cleverness is the state’s ruin; to govern the state without cleverness is the state’s blessing. Knowing these two principles is also a model. To master this model is called profound virtue. Profound virtue runs deep and far, turning back with things, and thus attaining great compliance.\n\nIn ancient times, sagely rulers governed the world through the Dao, simply bringing peace to the people. How could they display wealth, sensual pleasures, and rare crafts to the world, making the people keenly aware? If the people clearly knew of wealth, sensual pleasures, and rare crafts, and the ruler’s fondness for them ran deep, then they would vie for superficial gains, and those who prized novelty and craft would fill the courts and markets, all abandoning fundamentals to chase after trivialities.\n\nTherefore, a ruler of virtue rejects rare crafts, shuns extraordinary wealth, and distances himself from sensual pleasures. Then the people will not contend for frivolous gains, and those skilled in novelty will have no outlet for their work. All will abandon vain pursuits and devote themselves to solid endeavors. In but a few years, pure customs will flourish widely—this is Laozi’s true intent in advocating the simplicity of the people, not to make them truly foolish.\n\nLaozi expounds the principles of the great Dao, desiring that rulers be true rulers, ministers true ministers, fathers true fathers, and sons true sons, so that the constant norms of human relations are properly ordered. Does he truly teach the people to be ignorant, leaving them unaware of the hierarchy between high and low? Is he right to say the people are difficult to govern?\n\nIf the common people know what can be seized, they will devise a thousand schemes, and though the law be as severe as frost, none will be governable. Laozi’s analogy—governing with cleverness or without it—how profound is its meaning? Not so. It means that when the people are cunning, if the ruler governs with cunning and calculation, it becomes a calamity for the people. If ministers use their intelligence to guide the ruler in governance, they become the ruler’s ruin.\n\nThus, the model is to keep the people simple and reject extravagance, calling this \"profound virtue.\" The terms \"far\" and \"deep\" are used to emphasize its difficulty, with frugality as the guiding principle.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Five**\nThe reason the rivers and seas can be kings of all valleys is that they excel in humility; thus they become kings of all valleys. Therefore, if the sage wishes to be above the people, they speak with humility; if they wish to lead, they place themselves behind. Thus, though they dwell above, the people do not feel burdened; though they stand ahead, the people do not feel harmed. Therefore, the world delights in exalting them and never tires of it. Because they do not contend, none in the world can contend with them.\n\nRivers and seas lie in the lowest places, and so they can receive the waters of all the world’s mountains and streams. This admonishes the noble person governing the state: if they can be tolerant and receptive, great affairs will be accomplished. If one does not remain lowly but instead occupies a high position, things will reverse when they reach their extreme—what is high will become low, and what is low will become high. This is the inevitable principle of circumstance.\n\nThus, the sages of old labored in body and mind to bring peace to the world, and so the people cherished and loved them without resentment, and none plotted against them. If one loses this Dao and acts otherwise, misfortune will follow, and people may contend without resolution.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Six**\nThe world all says my Dao is great, seeming unlike anything else. Precisely because it is great, it seems unlike anything else. If it were like something, it would long since have been small. I possess three treasures, which I treasure and hold fast: the first is compassion, the second is frugality, and the third is not daring to be first in the world.\n\nCompassion makes one capable of courage; frugality makes one capable of expansiveness; not daring to be first in the world makes one capable of becoming the chief of all vessels. Now, if one abandons compassion yet seeks courage, abandons frugality yet seeks expansiveness, abandons humility yet seeks precedence, one is doomed.\n\nCompassion ensures victory in battle and firmness in defense. Heaven will save such a one, protecting them with compassion. The adept warrior is not martial; the skilled fighter is not angry; the one who excels in victory does not contend; the one who excels in employing others places themselves below. This is called the virtue of non-contention, the power of employing others, the ultimate alignment with Heaven’s ancient principle.\n\nThere is a saying in warfare: \"I dare not act as the host but act as the guest; I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.\" This is called advancing without advancing, warding off without arms, seizing without weapons, and facing no enemy. No misfortune is greater than underestimating the enemy; underestimating the enemy nearly cost me my treasures. Thus, when opposing armies clash, the one who grieves will prevail.\n\nThe great Dao seems foolish, appearing truly ignorant. If one claims, \"My Dao is truly great,\" it has long since become small. It is said to be \"small,\" urging one to hold fast to the Dao firmly and refine one’s nature to its essence.\n\nThe teaching of the three treasures: through compassion, one acts with courage in the Dao, benefiting all things; through frugality, granaries are filled; by not daring to be first in the world, one does not seek to be first in all matters or to indulge in pleasure, thus laying the foundation for kingship. \"Vessel\" refers to the sacred vessel.\n\nIf one abandons compassion yet seeks courage, they will surely be greedy, extravagant, and cruel. Abandoning frugality yet seeking expansiveness means using resources without restraint. Abandoning humility yet seeking precedence means one’s aspirations are exhausted.\n\nWhy speak again of compassion? It is to distinguish its use from the earlier mention. If a commander can wage war with compassion, they will surely prevail in open battle. Compassionate warfare does not mean refusing to fight; it means having compassion for the lives of the soldiers and fighting only when unavoidable. Thus, in defending a city, they will be unshakable. Even if besieged, Heaven will surely protect them. How do we know Heaven will protect them? Because their hearts cannot bear the harm of war and the loss of lives.\n\nThus, Heaven observes from without, and there are four virtues—I do not know what they are. The wise can discern them, not as omens of misfortune but as the fullest expression of these four virtues, aligning with Heaven and Earth. This chapter speaks of the army of the Dao, upholding Heaven’s mandate to punish the false. The general does not act recklessly but preserves benevolence and magnanimity. The ruler will have no worries, and calamity will be pacified.",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter 57**\nThis ancient teaching is most easy to know, most easy to practice—yet none under Heaven can know it, none can practice it.\nWords have their origin; affairs have their lord. It is only through ignorance that they do not know me.\nThose who know me are rare; thus, I am esteemed. Therefore, the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade within.\n\"Most easy to know\" refers to the meaning of words and characters; \"most easy to practice\" refers to the great Dao and great virtue.\nThose who truly know grasp only the meaning within the text; none can practice it, for the words are profound, and fools do not comprehend.\n\"Words have their origin\" means the text has its beginning; \"affairs have their lord\" means borrowing things as their master.\nThe scripture says, \"It is only through ignorance\" that people do not know me.\n\"Those who know me are rare\"—Laozi thus esteems himself. Playfully, he calls the sage one who wears rough cloth while embracing fine jade, for outwardly humble yet inwardly noble.\n\n**Chapter 58**\nTo know yet seem not to know is supreme.\nNot to know yet claim to know is a flaw.\nOnly by regarding this flaw as a flaw can one avoid flaw.\nThe sage is without flaw because he regards the flaw as a flaw—thus, he is without flaw.\nWhat the noble person does is only to ensure no trace is left. If truly so, others will not know him—this is supreme.\nOne should not teach others to know; if they come to understand the Dao, it is called a flaw.\nIf one acts thus—though others do not know him—he assumes they do and prepares as if they knew, thus remaining flawless.\nTherefore, the sage practices the Dao throughout his life without flaw, for he holds fast to the Dao and governs himself with discipline.\n\n**Chapter 59**\nWhen the people do not fear authority, great authority will come.\nDo not grow weary of their dwelling; do not despise their livelihood.\nOnly by not growing weary can one avoid despising.\nThus, the sage knows himself but does not display himself; loves himself but does not exalt himself.\nTherefore, he discards that and takes this.\nThis speaks of kings, ministers, and commoners who cultivate themselves and act with caution, solely devoted to the great Dao.\nThe scripture says, \"When the people do not fear authority, great authority will come.\"\nThose who rule all under Heaven with violence—at first, the people may seem to fear, but over time, they cease to fear. Once they no longer fear, the nation’s great disaster arrives, and none can avert it.\nCommoners must not daily indulge in contempt for the law, belittle others, or insult inferiors. If one day they violate the penal code, their lives cannot be preserved.\nFor kings, great disaster is great authority; for commoners, the penal code is great authority.\n\"Do not grow weary of their dwelling; do not despise their livelihood\"—kings must not indulge in extravagant gardens or excessive detached palaces, must not secretly venture out, must not favor actors or jesters, must not waste the people’s resources, must not impose labor without reason, and must act in accordance with the seasons.\nMinisters and commoners must not associate with the foolish, stubborn, or violent, nor disparage others’ skills.\nThe text further warns: the ancient sages always prepared for what could be foreseen. By preparing, one knows the potential calamities and thus does not display oneself.\nIt also says, \"loves himself but does not exalt himself\"—if one does not value oneself over others, how can one not love oneself?\nBy loving oneself, one first labors for oneself, then attains peace—this is discarding that and taking this.\n\n**Chapter 60**\nTo be brave in daring is to kill; to be brave in not daring is to live.\nThese two—one brings benefit, the other harm.\nWhat Heaven detests—who knows the reason?\nThus, even the sage finds it difficult.\nThe Way of Heaven does not contend yet excels in victory; does not speak yet excels in response; is not summoned yet comes of itself; is unhurried yet excels in planning.\nHeaven’s net is vast and wide, sparse yet nothing escapes.\nIf the people do not fear death, how can death be used to frighten them?\nIf one could make the people always fear death and execute those who act strangely, who would dare?\nThere is always an executioner. To kill in place of the executioner is to take the place of the great carpenter in hewing.\nThose who take the place of the great carpenter in hewing rarely avoid injuring their hands.\nIn governing all under Heaven, one must adhere to the constant Dao, benefit all living beings, and not favor harshness and violence.\nIf harshness and violence prevail, many people will be killed.\nIf this is truly practiced, it is called bravery.\nOne should model oneself on Heaven and Earth, enact the great Dao, follow the constant principles of the four seasons, act in accordance with the times, and reward and punish in accord with affairs.\nThen the people will receive grace, and many will live.\nIf one asks those who govern all under Heaven: from which of these two do things arise?\nFrom bravery comes harm; from not daring to be brave comes benefit.\nThe text further warns: the Way of Heaven is subtle, detesting fullness and favoring humility. Only the Supreme Lord cherishes life. Whether good or evil, the descent of fortune or misfortune is unfathomable.\nEven the sages of high antiquity, reverent and cautious, dared not be complacent—they found it difficult indeed.\nHeaven does not contend with the myriad things; Heaven is ever vigorous and unceasing. The myriad things follow the seasons and find their peace. The transitions of the four seasons come as if summoned, without expectation.\nIs there planning in this? This is the clarity of Heaven’s Way.\nIf a ruler dares to disdain all under Heaven and belittle the myriad things, Heaven’s decree is not obscured—though not swift, it will surely respond. How can one not fear?\nIf the people do not fear death, using extreme punishments to restrain them is wrong.\nIf the people truly feared death, the state would consider this strange.\nLaozi says: \"Would I not seize and kill them?\"\nAlas! Who would dare, fearing Heaven’s Way?\nKings establish laws and offices, each with its proper charge. If the people commit crimes, the officials hold them accountable, governing according to the law. Even so, there may be errors—thus, the ruler does not pardon transgressors.\nHeaven entrusts governance to the ruler; the ruler acts on Heaven’s behalf to order the world. If he acts recklessly, can there be salvation?\nThis is why the ruler does not pardon errors—those who transgress are thus dealt with.\n\n**Chapter 61**",

The wise can discern them, not as omens of misfortune but as the fullest expression of these four virtues, aligning with Heaven and Earth. This chapter speaks of the army of the Dao, upholding Heaven’s mandate to punish the false. The general does not act recklessly but preserves benevolence and magnanimity. The ruler will have no worries, and calamity will be pacified.",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter 62**\n\nWhen the people suffer hunger, it is because their superiors consume too much in taxes—this is why they hunger.\nWhen the people are hard to govern, it is because their superiors act with excessive force—this is why they are hard to govern.\nWhen people treat death lightly, it is because they seek too much to preserve life—this is why they treat death lightly.\nOnly those who do not cling to life as precious are wiser than those who overvalue it.\n\nIn governing the state, one must ensure the people are secure in their livelihood. Do not impose heavy taxes or harsh levies, for if taxes are heavy and levies harsh, the people will lack resources.\nWhen the people lack resources, the thought of theft and banditry arises. Once such thoughts take root, they will take up arms and slaughter one another—this is called \"hard to govern.\"\nAs a ruler of the world, do not overreach.\nWhat is overreaching? The Five Excesses are an example.\nIf one acts thus, the people will lose their sustenance. When many lose their sustenance, they will stop at nothing—how much harder will they be to govern!\nPeople treat death lightly because they violate the law and take risks to secure food and resources. Why? Because the alternative is a fate worse than death—there is no other path to survival.\nThe foolish, in their ignorance, believe that breaking the law and taking risks can sustain life. Little do they know it will cost them their lives.\nThus, those who do not cling to life as precious are wiser than those who overvalue it.\n\n**Chapter 63**\n\nIn life, people are soft and supple; in death, they are rigid and unyielding.\nIn life, plants are tender and fragile; in death, they are withered and brittle.\nThus, rigidity and strength belong to death’s company, while softness and suppleness belong to life’s.\nTherefore, when armies are strong, they do not prevail; when trees are stiff, they break.\nThus, the rigid and strong occupy the lower position, while the soft and weak occupy the higher.\n\nIn all the world, nothing is softer or weaker than water, yet in attacking the hard and strong, nothing surpasses it—nothing can replace it.\nThat the soft overcomes the hard and the weak overcomes the strong is known to all, yet none can practice it.\nThus the sage says: \"One who bears the nation’s disgrace is called the lord of the altars of soil and grain.\nOne who bears the nation’s misfortune is called the king of all under heaven.\"\n\nSoftness and weakness, rigidity and strength, tenderness and fragility, withering and brittleness—these are metaphors. What is meant by speaking of life and death is the art of cultivation and salvation.\nIf one knows that softness and suppleness, tenderness and fragility belong to life, while rigidity and strength, withering and brittleness belong to death, does one then understand cultivation and salvation?\nIf one understands cultivation and salvation, then what is the source of softness and suppleness, tenderness and fragility?\nThis is the great qi of Heaven and Earth’s Dao, which all things receive. It depends on whether one nurtures it or not, practices it or not.\nIf rulers and ministers, nobles and commoners alike, employ this Dao—the ruler will govern the world in peace, the minister will fulfill loyalty and filial piety without negligence, and the commoner will see their household flourish.\nThose who go against this Dao—are they not rigid, strong, withered, and brittle?\n\nYet people wish to regulate their qi and blood to sustain life, just as trees, if they endure the warmth of spring and are planted with care, watered and tended, will thrive long.\nIt is also said: Those who govern households regulate themselves by the Dao and employ propriety in managing servants. Then servants will labor diligently, and the master will live in ease.\nWhen a tree’s roots are deep and firm, its branches and leaves flourish, and its trunk remains whole for years. Who does not know that all things must first follow the Dao to succeed?\nThus, when servants labor and the master rests at ease, when branches and leaves flourish and the trunk thrives—this is the result of nurturing and riding the flow of qi.\nTherefore, when servants work to support the household, when branches and leaves draw rain and dew to nourish the trunk—this is the inevitable principle of circumstance!\nHow profound—rigidity and strength occupy the lower position, while softness and weakness occupy the higher. Water is the softest and weakest, yet metal and stone are the hardest. To say that nothing surpasses it in attacking the hard is not to claim that water cannot be replaced.\nStone may seem hard, but if it is not truly hard, water cannot penetrate it. Yet when qi precedes and water follows, even the hardest will be pierced, the most rigid will be softened, the strongest will be weakened. This is the great transformation flowing freely—governance without words.\nLet the ruler of the world embody this, let ministers emulate it, and let scholars and commoners regulate themselves by it—then the world will know no evil.\nThe sage’s capacity is as vast as Heaven and Earth, their great virtue unstinting, their benevolence extending to all living beings—then the world will defend the altars of soil and grain.\nIf the ruler reveres those above and below, if ministers fear the spirits and gods, if scholars and commoners respect the law and honor their ancestors—then ruler will be ruler, minister will be minister, and all within the seas will enjoy peace and prosperity. How joyful the people will be, and how the king of all under heaven will reign!\n\n**Chapter 64**\n\nThe Way of Heaven—is it not like drawing a bow?\nWhat is high is pressed down, what is low is lifted up; what is excessive is reduced, what is insufficient is supplemented.\nThe Way of Heaven reduces the excessive to supplement the insufficient.\nThe way of man is not so—it reduces the insufficient to serve the excessive.\nWho can take from what is excessive to give to all under heaven? Only one who possesses the Dao.\nThus the sage acts without claiming credit, accomplishes without dwelling on achievement, and does not wish to display worthiness.\n\nLet the ruler of the world and all beneath him practice the great Dao—its principle is like drawing a new bow.\nIf some parts are too stiff and others too weak, reduce the stiff and strengthen the weak—this is the metaphor.\nHeaven’s Way detests fullness and favors humility, so the great transformation remains constant, never rising without returning to balance. Where does its merit lie?\nIn reducing the excessive to supplement the insufficient.\n\nIn governing the world, if the state has enough for its needs without excess, then the people will not suffer want. If there is excess, the people will be impoverished.\nIf one can truly take from the excessive to supply the people’s insufficiency, then the world will be at peace, and the kingly Way will shine brightly.\nIf ministers and people do not praise or extol such a ruler, Heaven will protect the state, ensuring its permanence and prosperity. What need is there for empty praise?\nIn this way, the ruler stands above, ministers are content below, and the dynasty endures for generations—is this not constancy?\nIf scholars and commoners practice this Dao, their households will be harmonious, their neighborhoods peaceful, and their friendships lasting without rancor.

Those with virtue oversee the tally; those without virtue enforce exactions. The Way of Heaven shows no partiality, yet it ever bestows upon the good.\n\nWhen enmity remains undivided, even if one seeks reconciliation with kindness, the aggrieved cannot release their grievance—this cannot be deemed good. If a ruler can dissolve the world’s great grievances, then seated in the court hall, he may spread the great Dao, rectify governance and punishments, absolve the innocent, punish the guilty, relieve the destitute, and moderate taxes to ensure the people retain surplus without exhausting all they possess. Then grievances will dissolve, resentments will settle, and the Supreme Lord may be drawn near.\n\nIf ruler and ministers truly embody this and prosper—is it not so? Otherwise, if one sits in the court hall grasping the celestial mandate yet oppresses the people to enrich oneself, levies heavy taxes, and exhausts all the people possess—is this not enforcing exactions? The Way of Heaven is luminous and clear—calamity will surely follow!\n\nEven if scholars and commoners act with good intent, though they may resolve others’ strife, they cannot dispel lingering resentment—thus it cannot be called good. If one lends goods to aid others, concealing hardship and seeking no profit—is this the conduct of a noble person? A good person? But if one lends to others for profit, demanding double the principal, exhausting all the poor possess, pressing the destitute with deadlines, becoming like Feng Huan or the Lord of Mengchang—is this the conduct of a noble person?

Let the people value life and not wander far. Though there be boats and carriages, none will ride them; though there be armor and weapons, none will array them. Let the people return to knotting cords for use. Let them find sweetness in their food, beauty in their clothing, peace in their dwellings, and joy in their customs.

The four seasons will follow their order, wind and rain will harmonize, and the people will prosper in their farming and weaving. Granaries will be full, clothing ample, and all will delight in their joys, living out their lives in goodness. Though borders lack defenses, they will stand firm; though passes and barriers remain unbarred, none will breach them. Though there be mighty ships and armored chariots, warriors of thousand-jun strength, none will have cause to employ them or array them in formation.\n\nThe people of neighboring lands, though close at hand, will never abandon their own to go to another, nor will others come—yet it is not that they do not come, but rather that the ruler harbors no greed. If greed truly existed, fugitives would be welcomed, and neighboring states would raise questions—how could it be thus?\n\nIf among the people there are the wealthy, each with tenants who till their fields and offer grain to their lords, should the rich govern with virtue, taking little and giving much, then all will receive grace and remain settled, able to secure their livelihoods.

      "translated_text": "The Way of the ruler in governing the people is to heed solely the mandate of Heaven—can this truly be verified?\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Six**\nTruthful words are not embellished; embellished words are not truthful.\nThe good do not dispute; the disputatious are not good.\nThe wise are not encyclopedic; the encyclopedic are not wise.\nThe sage does not hoard: having given to others, he himself possesses more; having bestowed upon others, he himself abounds further.\nThe Way of Heaven benefits without harming.\nThe Way of the sage acts without contending.\n\nFor the loyal and trustworthy gentleman in the world, when the Dao prevails across the land, it is not that men suddenly praise and extol him—this is the highest attainment. If others do praise him, it is merely self-aggrandizement. Thus, those who flatter me reveal that my Dao is not steadfast—this is why the unadorned is not embellished, and the unembellished is not false. Those who claim to know me show that the Dao has become artful; if one truly seeks to practice it, one must not indulge in superficial praise. As the saying goes: \"Illumine the four eyes, penetrate the four ears\"—this is not achieved through meticulous scrutiny. If one broadly seeks and inquires excessively, not only will one fail to know, but calamity will ensue.\n\nThe sage’s \"illumination of the four eyes\" and \"penetration of the four ears\" arise from observing naturally and listening without contrivance. For the ruler of a state, this ensures that the people suffer no unjust misfortune, and the nation knows no perverse calamity—thus, the ruler need not be overly exacting, and both he and the state remain secure. When the gentleman’s household and person are at peace, does not all else follow in sincerity?\n\nNot knowing is the closure of all affairs. Do not be erudite among petty men; do not scrutinize the treacherous. Knowledge must be sought from the noble; listening must be directed to the worthy—then household and state will be secure.\n\nThus, the ancient sages did not flaunt their virtue nor claim credit for their achievements, yet all under Heaven treated their possessions as their own. They aided those in need, and by aiding others, they themselves gained abundance. Therefore, the more one gives to others, the more one possesses. Thus, the Supreme Emperor loves life and detests killing; when sages and gentlemen embody and enact this, they succeed. Though their lives end, men never forget them, for their virtue is one with Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Seven**\n*Imperial Commentary on the Authentic Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue, Volume II, Completed by the Great Ming Taizu, the Gao Emperor.*",

But if the wealthy take without principle and labor without regard for season, their people will uproot their households and flee to other lands. Though the scale differs, the principle and circumstances remain the same.\n\nAlas!",
