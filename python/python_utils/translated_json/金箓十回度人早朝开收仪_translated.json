Deliverance of Beings: Morning, Midday, and Evening Invocation and Reception Ceremony* (一卷).\nSource: *Zhengtong Daozang* (正统道藏), *Tongxuan* (洞玄) Section, **Ritual and Auspicious Practices** (威仪类).\n\n---\n\n**Golden Seal Tenfold Ritual for Deliverance of Beings: Morning Invocation and Reception Ceremony**\n*Declaration of Ritual Purity*\n\nWith utmost sincerity, I take refuge in the ten directions of sacred scriptures,\nMay I vow that all beings open their hearts to enlightenment and understanding,\nAnd faithfully uphold, recite, and chant them.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, I take refuge in the ten directions of Dao/Way’s treasures,\nMay I vow that all beings awaken their minds to dedicate merit,\nAnd universally embrace faith and reverence.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, I take refuge in the ten directions of the Master’s treasures,\nMay I vow that all beings ascend the Law’s bridge without obstruction.\n\n---\n**Ode to Past Lives**\n\nThough faith in past lives exists, the weak and lost deny it.\nAll seek to witness it now—\nYet when they hear, they call it vain and distant.\n\nThe great sages teach the Dao with clarity,\nTheir sorrowful hearts pity the stubborn and deluded.\nThey grieve for my suffering, boundless in their care,\nTheir ceaseless efforts bring me endless worry.\n\n---\n**First Invocation: Opening the Scripture**\n\nYour humble servant, with reverence, presents:\nWhen the Golden Seal (金蒙) established the primordial axis,\nThe sacred text was already contained within the boundless expanse;\nWhen the Dragon Han (龙汉) revealed its diagram,\nThe Primordial Beginning (元始) emerged in the ancient kalpa (祖劫).\n\nAs the divine wind stirred,\nThe Dao/Way’s *qi* began to coalesce.\nThe Eight Trigrams of the Dragon’s scripture were formed,\nThe Three Primordial *fans* (凤篆) of the Phoenix were perfected.\n\nFrom this, the myriad transformations of Heaven and Earth were born;\nBy this, the four seasons of Yin and Yang were set in motion.\n\nThe Dao’s teachings align with the diagrams of the Yellow River and Luo (河洛之图书),\nAnd proceed without contradiction;\nIts efficacy surpasses the eight trigrams of Xi and Fu (羲文之卦象),\nYet is still insufficient to describe.\n\nThe subject now humbly obeys the august edict,\nand devoutly practices the Golden Seal rites,\nprolonging the solemn fast for several days and nights.\nThe subject leads the assembled officials upon the altar platform,\nreciting in turn the *Tàishàng Dòngxuán Língbǎo Wúliáng Dùrén Shàngpǐn Miào Jīng*—\nthe *Mysterious Scripture of the Supreme Dao/Way, Spirit Treasure, and Infinite Salvation*—\nin reverent homage to the sacred edicts,\neach recited in full.\n\nIn reliance upon the boundless Three Treasures (三宝),\nthe merciful Sovereign of the Ten Directions (十方) and all celestial saints (诸天大圣),\nwhose compassionate vows and efficacy sustain the sacred scriptures,\nthe subject humbly prays that the Golden Mouth (金口) may proclaim the profound mysteries,\nand the luminous repository (琅函) may unveil its hidden secrets.\n\nTo reveal the mysteries of the Primordial Beginning (先天),\nand to expound the ancient texts (太古篇章),\nso that all beneath Heaven and Earth’s vast expanse\nmay universally attain enlightenment,\nand none be left without grace.\n\nWith deepest reverence to the Void Sovereign (虚皇),\nthe subject practices the sacred scriptures.\n\n**Reciting while seated:**\n**Reciting upon completion, dissolving the seat:**\nFor all future lives,\nto cultivate auspicious causes and conditions.\n\nIf granted enlightenment,\nthe subject gratefully receives the profound mercy.\n\n**Dedicatory Merit Transfer:**\n\nThe subject humbly presents:\nThe Great Brightness (大明) was born in the East (东),\nwhere the East holds the position of Minor Yang (少阳).\nAll things emerge from the *Zhèn* (震) trigram,\nwhich is the domain of the Thunder Gate (雷门).\n\nThus, when Yang is aroused and strikes,\nthere is sound;\nwhen the Thunder Gate is roused and activated,\nit pierces the senses.\n\nAll celestial beings praise its virtue,\nleaping in joyous accord with the sacred resonance;\nThe realm inclines in heart,\nand here begins the hearing of the Supreme Dao/Way.\n\nThis is the meaning of \"healing the deaf to make them hear\"—\nthe efficacy of the scripture’s symbols.\n\nThe subject, having just led the officials in reciting\nthe *Tàishàng Dòngxuán Língbǎo Wúliáng Dùrén Shàngpǐn Miào Jīng*,\nturns the merit toward the East:\n\nThe Supreme Spirit Treasure of the Boundless Primordial (无极太上灵宝天尊),\nThe Celestial Descending Blessing of the Jade Purity (玉清降福天尊),\nThe Nine *Qi* Sovereign of the East, Green Primordial (青元青天九炁天君),\nThe Eastern Dipper Star of Recorded Destiny (东斗注算星君),\nThe Green Sovereign Protecting Spirits (青帝护魂君),\nThe Supreme Sun Emperor of the Day Palace, Great Dan Yu’s Flaming Radiance (日宫太丹郁仪炎光太阳帝君),\nThe Celestial Enclosure Emperor-Sed (天垣帝座星君),\nThe Supreme True Sovereign of the Eastern Wood Virtue, Green Emperor of the Primordial Yang (木德始阳青皇上真道君),\nThe True Sovereign of the Year Star (岁星真君),\nThe Eastern *Dī* Constellation Star Sovereign (氐宿星君),\nThe Heavenly Chariot Star of the House Constellation (天驷房宿星君),\nThe Heavenly King Star of the Heart Constellation (心宿天王星君),\nThe Stars of the Eastern Market Enclosure (天市垣列宿星君),\nThe Divine Sovereign of the Heavenly Scorpius Palace (天蝎宫尊神),\nThe *Mǎo* Palace’s Song Division Stars (卯宫宋分列宿星君),\nThe Supreme Great God of the East, Boundless Primordial (无极无量品至真大神),\nThe Flying Celestial King, Longevity Saint of Infinite Salvation (飞天神王长生大圣无量度人君),\nThe Eastern Hua Sovereign of Command (东华司命真君),\nThe Auspicious Sovereign of the Year’s Destiny and the Longevity Horse (本命太岁禄马尊神),\nand all the responsive spirits (一切真灵) of the ritual platform.\n\nThe subject beseeches the efficacy of the scriptures and their vows\nto pacify and stabilize the Eastern realm of the Great Fire (甲乙大火),\nensuring the nation’s prosperity is secured,\nand the celestial foundation (天根) remains steadfast.\n\nThe subject humbly prays that the Jade Script descends its radiance,\nAnd the Pearl Constellation follows the harmonious order.\n\nThe Eastern Hua Sovereign, Master of Calculations,\nBestows upon the Woodly Sage years of unaging life;\nThe Woodly Virtue brings flourishing prosperity,\nAnd the Eastern Dipper inscribes the character of eternal life.\n\nMay auspicious omens descend in abundance,\nAnd blessings extend endlessly without bound.\n\nWith bowed head, the subject takes refuge and swiftly recites hymns of praise.\nThe *Zhìhuì* Sutra is chanted,\nAnd then the *Hóngdào* Reveres the scripture of the Supreme Primordial of the Mysterious and Ethereal Dao (太上玄虚宗).\n\nWith reverence and humility, one attains immortality,\nAnd traverses countless *kāli* aeons.\n\nThe towering, boundless virtue of the Great Truth,\nSilent and profound, arising from the Unborn.\nThe celestial landscape constructs an empty framework,\nAnd the Void naturally nurtures its essence.\n\nThe sun and moon shine brilliantly,\nBringing eternal peace and endless joy.\n\nThe subject, with utmost respect,\nRecites the Five-Jewel Scriptures born from the Great Void,\nAnd the celestial harmonies resounding from the Scarlet Effulgence’s *jìá* cycle.\n\nThe profound meaning is obscure yet vast,\nThe intricate verses difficult to fully expound.\nEight-cornered radiance descends,\nRefined through the furnace of the *Dòngyáng*;\nNine luminous glories float forth,\nEmitted from the *Liúhuǒ*’s ascending brilliance.\n\nThis sacred treasure should be guarded in the highest palace,\nNot lightly revealed to the common folk below.\n\nThe subject, in awe of the lofty commands,\nFaithfully crafts the Golden Talisman,\nAnd conducts the grand *Dàxiān* fast for several days and nights,\nNow leading the gathered officials in the second recitation,\nTurning the scripture *Dàshàng Dòngxuán Língbǎo Wúliàngdù Rén Shàngpǐn Miàojīng*,\nOffering obeisance to the Precious Edict,\nAnd relying upon the Boundless Three Treasures of Infinite Compassion,\nThe Ten Directions’ Celestial Saints,\nTheir merciful vows and the efficacy of the scriptures.\n\nThe subject humbly prays for this Dao to be illuminated,\nAnd for wisdom to awaken within.\n\nThus, the *Yúnjǐ* may unfold its teachings,\nAs if the Celestial Truth itself descended to bestow them.\n\nThe Golden Truth resounds in harmony,\nAscending to the Three Pure Heavens;\nThe Jade Chapter reveals the Mysterious,\nAnd expounds the wonders of the Ten Hua.\n\nAll who hear the *fàn* language,\nShall attain extraordinary merit.\n\nWith bowed head, the subject venerates the Void Sovereign,\nAnd practices the sacred scriptural laws.\n\nThe ritual platform is set, and hymns are intoned—\nThe scripture recitation is now complete.\n\n**解座吟 回向**\n\nWith reverence, the subject now declares the return-offering:\n\nEarth engenders Fire, Fire the essence of supreme Yang;\nThe two *Liáng* form the *Lí* hexagram—\nLí, the trigram of the South, pure and luminous.\nDoubled in clarity, it adorns the Central Axis,\nSo that all under Heaven may behold its radiant virtue.\n\nSince the Celestial Sage first expounded the Dao and its teachings,\nThe grand design of the *Huángjí* has unfolded in majesty.\nThe lofty Dao is vast, its name beyond measure.\n\nThe subject, having led the officials in recitation,\nAscended the platform to chant the *Second Pervasion* of the\n*Supreme Dao’s Mysterious Treasure Scripture of Boundless Salvation for All Beings*,\nNow directs the return-offering to:\nThe **Southern Void Supreme Treasure Sovereign**,\nThe **Southern Longevity Extending Fate Sovereign**,\nThe **Southern Great Elixir Three-Qi Celestial Lord**,\nThe **Southern Dipper’s Upper-Generating Lord**,\nThe **Red Sovereign of Nourishing Qi**,\nThe **Southern Taiwei Enclosure Imperial Seat Star Lord**,\nThe **Southern Fire Virtue

King Long-Life Great Sage of Boundless Salvation**,\nThe **Southern Pole Record Bureau True Lord**,\nThe **Native Year’s Grand Duke and Auspicious Horse Deity**,\nAnd all responsive spirits of the ritual hall.\n\nBy the merit and power of the scripture,\nMay the South’s *Bing-Ding* Fire sequence be steadied and pacified.\nMay the nation’s destiny be secured,\nThe Celestial Root preserved,\nFortune invited, omens blessed,\nLongevity ensured, and life sustained.\n\nThe **Mars Star Lord**,\nThe **Willow Star Heavenly Kitchen Star Lord**,\nThe **Star Host Heavenly Treasury Star Lord**,\nThe **Zhang Constellation Heavenly Scales Star Lord**,\nThe **Noon Palace’s Circulating Star Hosted Deities**,\nThe **Lion Constellation Deity**,\nThe **Southern Void Boundless Rank Supreme True God**,\nThe **Flying Celestial King Long-Life Great Sage of Boundless Salvation**,\nThe **Southern Pole Record Bureau True Lord**,\nThe **Native Year’s Grand Duke and Auspicious Horse Deity**,\nAnd all responsive spirits of the ritual hall.\n\nI humbly pray that the **Red Scriptures** may illuminate my fate,\nAnd the **Yellow Dao** proceed in its proper course.\nMay the **Southern Dipper** ascend and bring blessings of longevity and contentment,\nAnd the **Eastern Hua** bestow fortune, granting peace and tranquility.\nMay the people flourish in the customs of ritual and music,\nAnd the nation uphold the governance of cultural refinement.\n\nI prostrate myself in reverence and take refuge,\nThen recite hymns in rotation.\n\n**Hymn of Wisdom and Benevolence:**\n*\"Learn to abandon worldly attachments through Daoist cultivation,\nEach thought building upon the last, accumulating without end.\nDisturbing spirits come and go, agitating my mind;\nNo disturbance does not pass—my spirit is restless.\nTo extinguish thoughts and still the void,\nI enter the boundless silence of emptiness.\nI seek the scripture as one parched and famished,\nAnd hold fast to my resolve like iron and stone.\nMay the Five Spirits guide me on the path of celestial ascent,\nAnd the sacred talismans ensure my passage across the heavens.*\n\n*In reverence to the South’s **Bing-Ding Fire** sequence,*\nI solemnly proclaim the **Sacred Offerings of Devotion**,\nAnd open the scriptures in threefold rotation.\nI humbly confess that my **spiritual diagrams** remain unmanifest,\nAnd the **True Scriptures** lie concealed within the **Eternal Auspicious**;\nThe **Dao** must now be practiced,\nAnd the **Star Lord of the Way** descend to the **Jade Realm**.\n\nThus, the **Primordial Emperor of the Beginning** grants me the **Wondrous Celestial Scriptures**,\nAnd I am entrusted to dwell in the **Upper Pure Purple Cloud Palace**.\nThe **Master of Fate** holds the **Divine Treasure of the Perfected Dao**,\nAnd teaches the **Boundless Supreme True Scripture** of the highest rank.\nThis single volume of the **Divine Treasure of the Perfected Dao**,\nThough its profound meaning is subtle and its words mysterious,\nIs the **ancestor of all scriptures in the Spirit Tower**.\n\nMajestic and vast is the **Great Dharma**,\nIts details intricate and difficult to fathom.\nNow I lead the assembled officials,\nAscending the platform for the third rotation to recite the\n*Supreme Scripture of the Perfected Dao’s Divine Treasure of Boundless Salvation*,\nOffering homage to the **Sacred Edicts**,\nAnd taking refuge in the **Incomparable Triple Jewel** and the **Sages of the Ten Directions**.\nBy the **mercy and compassionate power** of the scriptures,\nI pledge to uphold their efficacy.\n\nI humbly pray that the **Golden True** may accept my summons,\nAnd the **Jade Maiden** open the sacred scrolls.\nAll shall be verified in the **secret texts**,\nAnd contribute to the **grand expansion of the Ultimate Dao**.\nFrom the finest dust to the grandest sands,\nAll shall attain enlightenment.\nThe **sacred sounds** descend to earth,\nAnd harmonize with the **celestial scriptures** above,\nTogether manifesting the **wondrous transformation**.\nI prostrate myself before the **Void Emperor**,\nAnd practice the **scriptural methods**.\n\n**Hymn of the Ritual Seat:**\n*\"The recitation of the scripture is complete.\"*\n\n**Hymn of the Ritual Seat Dissolution and Dedication:**\n\n*\"Dedication to the West:*\nWith reverence, I follow the **Celestial Sage’s** teachings,\nUnlocking the gates of myriad mysteries.\nThe **Primordial Origin** hangs the pearl of wisdom,\nDrawing forth the **Sages of the Ten Directions**.\n\nThis is the **Incomparable Uppermost Scripture**,\nBinding the **Root of Wondrous Existence**.\nIts meaning pierces the **Deepest Dao**,\nIts efficacy extends to **Unending Benefaction**.\nBy this, the **nation’s destiny** is steadied,\nBy this, the **heavenly foundations** are secured.\n\n**Supreme Virtue** defies naming,\n**True Mysteries** are unfathomable.\nI have now led the **official assembly**,\nAscending the platform to recite the ***Supreme Dao of the Perfected Treasure of the Incomparable Scripture for Deliverance of All Beings (Uppermost Chapter of Wondrous Scripture)***,\nDirectly dedicating its merit to the **West of the Boundless Supreme Perfected Treasure-Sage**,\nThe **West of the Eight Trigrams Protective Body Treasure-Sage**,\nThe **West

Kings**, **Long-Life Great Sages** of the Incomparable Deliverance,\nThe **Western Spirit Officials of the True Sovereign**,\nThe **Lords of the Primordial Year and Auspicious Horse**—\nAll divine spirits who respond to this **fasting platform**,\nI beseech with the **merit and vow-power** of this scripture,\nTo stabilize the **West of the Regal Pillar (Geng-Xin)***,\nAnd to gather **auspicious blessings**, extending **longevity and peace**,\nEnsuring the **revered security of the ancestral altars**.\n\nMay all beings rejoice in this merit,\nAnd return again to pay homage.\nWith **jade characters and golden inscriptions**,\nI record **virtuous names** in the **Western Dipper**;\nWith **pearl stars and jade moon**,\nI display **auspicious hues** in the **Central Heaven**.\nMay **eternal felicity and great peace** prevail,\nAll attaining **serene stillness**.\n\nWith prostration, I return to refuge,\nAnd swiftly proceed with **praise and hymns**.\n**Hymn of Intelligence and Auspicious Grace.**\"\n\n「Assist me in the Six Perfections of **Daoic practice**,\nThus may I break free from the Three **Nether Realms***.\nWith fasting and rites to the **Supreme Uncarved**,\nBreathing and nurturing the **Cloud Seed** of **qi**,\nI wander within the **Golden Gate** of the **Celestial Palace**,\nAnd the **Jade Capital** becomes my home.\n\nNaturally, I birth the **Seven Treasures**,\nAnd each being rests upon a **lotus***.\nWith **Heavenly Mysteries** as my upper feast,\nAnd **Void Melon** as my lower delight,\nMy countenance shines brighter than ten suns,\nWhat need have I of reckoning years or **aeons**?\n\nThe **Dharma Drum** gathers all **Celestial Spirits**,\nAnd the **auspicious bell** summons the **Great Demon***.\nNow, in the **Fourth Recitation** of the **West**,\nI reverently proclaim the **Sacred Edicts** of **Gongwen***,\nAnd the **Fourfold Opening** of the **Scripture Text**,\nWith **Five Aeons** of merit and vow-power,\nUnifying **One Breath** to return to the **Origin**.\n\nThe myriad stars bow to the **Polar Star**,\nAbove, they array the **Heavenly Netherworlds** in ten thousand forms;\nThe **Six Heavens** span the **Northern Dao**,\nBelow, they govern all **demons and spirits**.\n\nOnly the **Original Chapter of the Numinous Treasure**,\nIs the **Essential Dao** of the **Upper Clarity***.\nTo command the **Celestial Governance**,\nThen the sun and moon halt their course,\nAnd the **Celestial Globe** ceases its motion*;\nTo sternly subdue the **Northern Netherworlds**,\nThen the **demonic essences** lose their courage,\nAnd the **ghostly fiends** perish utterly.\n\nThus, the **Scripture** is revealed to save the world,\nAnd to preserve the **Celestial Longevity**.\nThose who practice it attain the **Dao** and ascend as **Immortal**,\nRiding the clouds to roam the **Four Seas**;\nThose who uphold it remain in mortal form,\nYet rule eternally and govern the **Ten Thousand Years**.\n\nNow, I humbly follow the **Imperial Edict**,\nAnd earnestly cultivate the **Golden Talisman**,\nExtending **longevity and peace** through this grand **fasting** of many days and nights.\n\nI lead my **official retinue**,\nAscending the **fasting platform** for the **Fourth Recitation**,\nTo recite the ****Supreme Uncarved Numinous Treasure Scripture of Infinite Salvation**,\nOffering homage to the **Sacred Edicts**,\nAnd in reverence, taking refuge in the **Supreme Triple Jewel**—\nThe **Merciful Sovereign** of the **Ten Directions**,\nThe **Great Saints** of all **Heavens**,\nAnd their **compassionate merit and vow-power**—\nTo uphold the **Scripture’s efficacy**.\n\nMay the **Supreme Truth** mark this with divine pen,\nAnd the **Spiritual Consorts** attend at the **Sacred Portal**.\nShine forth **jade characters** in the **Great Void**,\nAnd weave **conch pearl texts** into the **Hidden Canon***.\nResound the **mystic drum** and **sacred clarion**,\nWith **hidden melodies** clear and resonant;\nSwell the **Daoic Ocean’s waves**,\nAnd let **mystic grace** flow boundless.\n\nMove the **flying and submerged**,\nStir the **plants and growths**—\nAll owe their **birth and flourishing** to this.\n\nWith prostration to the **Celestial Sovereign**,\nI practice the **Scripture’s method**.\nNow I **recite seated**,\nAnd having finished the **Scripture’s chanting**,\nI **lay down my seat** and conclude.\n\n「解座吟
