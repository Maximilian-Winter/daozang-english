  "full_translation": "**Laozi’s Dao De Jing**\n*Tang Dynasty Yizhou Longxing Temple Stele Edition*\n\n**Chapter One**\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao;\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal name.\nNameless, it is the origin of heaven and earth;\nNamed, it is the mother of the ten thousand things.\nFrom constant non-being, one observes its mystery;\nFrom constant being, one observes its manifestations.\nThese two emerge together yet differ in name.\nTogether they are called the profound.\nProfound and again profound—\nThe gateway to all mysteries.\n\n**Chapter Two**\nWhen all under heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises;\nWhen all know goodness as goodness, not-goodness arises.\nThus being and non-being produce each other,\nDifficult and easy complete each other,\nLong and short shape each other,\nHigh and low incline toward each other,\nTones and voices harmonize with each other,\nFront and back follow each other.\nTherefore the sage abides in non-action,\nPractices wordless teaching.\nThe ten thousand things arise yet he does not reject them,\nGives birth yet does not possess,\nActs yet does not rely,\nAccomplishes yet does not dwell.\nOnly because he does not dwell,\nDoes he not depart.\n\n**Chapter Three**\nNot exalting the worthy prevents the people from contending;\nNot prizing rare goods prevents the people from stealing;\nNot displaying what is desirable prevents the heart from disorder.\nThus the sage’s governance:\nEmpties the heart,\nFills the belly,\nWeakens the will,\nStrengthens the bones.\nAlways keeps the people without knowledge and without desire,\nSo that those with knowledge dare not act.\nAct thus, and nothing is ungoverned.\n\n**Chapter Four**\nThe Dao is empty,\nYet its use is inexhaustible.\nProfound!—\nThe ancestor of the ten thousand things.\nIt blunts sharpness,\nUntangles knots,\nSoftens brilliance,\nMerges with dust.\nSubmerged, it seems ever-present.\nI do not know whose child it is—\nIt appears before the image of the Emperor.\n\n**Chapter Five**\nHeaven and earth are not humane;\nThey treat the ten thousand things as straw dogs.\nThe sage is not humane;\nHe treats the hundred clans as straw dogs.\nThe space between heaven and earth—\nIs it not like a bellows?\nEmpty yet not collapsing,\nThe more it moves, the more it produces.\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion—\nBetter to hold to the center.\n\n**Chapter Six**\nThe spirit of the valley never dies—\nThis is called the mysterious female.\nThe gateway of the mysterious female\nIs the root of heaven and earth.\nSubtly enduring, it seems to exist;\nIts use is never exhausted.\n\n**Chapter Seven**\nHeaven is eternal, earth enduring.\nHeaven and earth endure because they do not live for themselves.\nThus the sage places himself last yet comes first,\nSets himself aside yet remains.\nIs it not because he is selfless\nThat he fulfills himself?\n\n**Chapter Eight**\nThe highest good is like water.\nWater benefits the ten thousand things yet does not contend.\nIt dwells in places all others despise—\nThus it is close to the Dao.\nIn dwelling, be close to the land;\nIn the heart, be deep;\nIn giving, be humane;\nIn speech, be sincere;\nIn governance, be orderly;\nIn affairs, be capable;\nIn action, be timely.\nOnly by not contending\nDoes one avoid blame.\n\n**Chapter Nine**\nTo hold and fill to overflowing\nIs not as good as stopping.\nTo sharpen to a point\nCannot be long preserved.\nWhen gold and jade fill the hall,\nNone can guard them.\nWealth and honor with arrogance\nBring self-inflicted misfortune.\nTo withdraw when the work is done,\nWhen the name is achieved—\nThis is the Dao of heaven.\n\n**Chapter Ten**\nIn carrying spirit and embracing unity,\nCan you never part from them?\nIn concentrating qi to attain softness,\nCan you be like an infant?\nIn cleansing and purifying your profound vision,\nCan you be without flaw?\nIn loving the people and governing the state,\nCan you practice non-action?\nIn the opening and closing of heaven’s gates,\nCan you play the female?\nIn understanding all directions,\nCan you do so without knowledge?\nGive birth and nurture,\nGive birth yet do not possess,\nAct yet do not rely,\nLead yet do not dominate—\nThis is called profound virtue.\n\n**Chapter Eleven**\nThirty spokes share one hub;\nIn its emptiness lies the cart’s usefulness.\nClay is shaped into a vessel;\nIn its emptiness lies the vessel’s usefulness.\nDoors and windows are cut to make a room;\nIn its emptiness lies the room’s usefulness.\nThus what is present provides advantage,\nWhile what is absent provides usefulness.\n\n**Chapter Twelve**\n\n**Chapter Twelve**\nThe five colors blind the eye;\nThe five tones deafen the ear;\nThe five flavors dull the palate;\nRacing and hunting madden the heart;\nRare goods incite harmful conduct.\nThus the sage attends to the belly, not the eye—\nTherefore, he rejects that and takes this.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen**\nFavor and disgrace are like shock,\nValuing great trouble as one’s own body.\nWhat does “favor and disgrace are like shock” mean?\nFavor is inferior.\nGaining it brings shock, losing it brings shock—\nThis is what “favor and disgrace are like shock” means.\nWhat does “valuing great trouble as one’s own body” mean?\nThe reason I have great trouble\nIs that I have a body.\nWhen I no longer have a body,\nWhat trouble could I have?\nThus, one who values the body more than the world\nMay be entrusted with the world;\nOne who loves the body for the sake of the world\nMay be charged with the world.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen**\nLook for it and it cannot be seen—called *yí*;\nListen for it and it cannot be heard—called *xī*;\nGrasp for it and it cannot be held—called *wēi*.\nThese three cannot be fully examined,\nSo they merge into one.\nAbove, it is not bright;\nBelow, it is not dark.\nEndless, unnameable,\nIt returns to nothingness.\nThis is called the formless form,\nThe image of no-thing—\nThis is called *hūhuǎng*.\nMeet it and you do not see its beginning;\nFollow it and you do not see its end.\nHold to the ancient Dao\nTo master the present being.\nTo know the ancient beginning\nIs called the thread of the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen**\nThe masters of old who were skilled in the Dao\nWere subtly profound and mysteriously penetrating,\nToo deep to be known.\nBecause they could not be known,\nI strain to describe them:\nCautious, as if crossing a winter stream;\nAlert, as if wary of neighbors on all sides;\nReserved, as if a guest;\nYielding, as ice about to melt;\nSimple, as uncarved wood;\nHollow, as a valley;\nOpaque, as muddy water.\nWho can still the turbid and make it gradually clear?\nWho can rouse the still and make it gradually live?\nThose who preserve this Dao\nDo not desire fullness.\nBecause they are not full,\nThey can be worn yet ever renewed.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen**\nAttain utmost emptiness,\nAbide in profound stillness.\nThe ten thousand things arise together,\nAnd I observe their return.\nThings flourish in abundance,\nEach returning to its root.\nReturning to the root is called stillness;\nStillness is called returning to life;\nReturning to life is called constancy;\nKnowing constancy is called clarity.\nNot knowing constancy leads to reckless action—disaster.\nKnowing constancy brings acceptance;\nAcceptance brings impartiality;\nImpartiality brings kingship;\nKingship brings heaven;\nHeaven brings the Dao;\nThe Dao brings enduringness—\nTo the end of one’s days, free from peril.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen**\nThe highest rulers—those below know they exist;\nNext, those they draw near and praise;\nNext, those they fear;\nNext, those they scorn.\nWhere trust is insufficient, distrust arises.\nHow carefully they weigh their words!\nWhen their tasks are accomplished and affairs completed,\nThe people all say, “We are naturally thus.”\n\nWhen tasks succeed and affairs are completed,\nThe people all say, “We are naturally thus.”\n\n**Chapter Eighteen**\nWhen the great Dao is abandoned, there are benevolence and righteousness.\nWhen wisdom and intelligence emerge, there is great artifice.\nWhen the six relations are disharmonious, there are filial piety and compassion.\nWhen the state is benighted and chaotic, there are loyal ministers.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen**\nAbandon sageliness, discard wisdom—\nThe people will benefit a hundredfold;\nAbandon benevolence, discard righteousness—\nThe people will return to filial piety and compassion;\nAbandon skill, discard profit—\nThere will be no thieves or bandits.\nThese three sayings, as cultural refinements, are insufficient.\nThus, let there be something to which they belong:\nManifest plainness, embrace simplicity,\nReduce self-interest, diminish desires.\n\n**Chapter Twenty**\nAbandon learning, and there will be no sorrow.\nBetween “yes” and “ah,”\nHow far apart are they?\nBetween good and evil,\nHow great is the distance?\nWhat others fear,\nOne cannot but fear.\nVast and boundless—its end is not yet!\nThe multitude bustle and brighten,\nAs if feasting on the great sacrifice,\nAs if ascending the springtime terrace.\nI alone am quiescent, my spirit unaroused,\nLike an infant who has not yet learned to smile.\nAdrift, adrift—with nowhere to return!\nThe multitude all have more than enough,\nI alone seem bereft.\nI possess the heart of a fool—so pure, so simple.\nThe common folk are clear and bright,\nI alone am dim and dull.\nThe common folk are sharp and keen,\nI alone am muddled and obscure.\nVast like the sea,\nDrifting without cease.\nThe multitude all have purpose,\nI alone am stubborn and coarse.\nI alone differ from others,\nAnd value the nourishment of the Mother.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One**\nThe fullness of great virtue\nFollows only the Dao.\nThe Dao as a thing—\nOnly vague, only elusive.\nElusive and vague,\nYet within it are images;\nVague and elusive,\nYet within it are things.\nProfound and obscure,\nYet within it is essence;\nIts essence is most real,\nWithin it is trustworthiness.\nFrom ancient times to the present,\nIts name does not depart,\nThrough which we behold the origin of all things.\nHow do I know the nature of the origin of all things?\nBy this.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two**\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two**\nTo yield is to be preserved whole;\nTo be bent is to become straight;\nTo be hollow is to be filled;\nTo be tattered is to be renewed;\nTo want is to possess;\nTo have abundance is to be perplexed.\nTherefore the sage embraces the One\nAnd becomes the model for all under heaven.\nNot seeing things from his own perspective, he is clear;\nNot asserting himself, he is distinguished;\nNot boasting, he gains merit;\nNot priding himself, he endures.\nIt is precisely because he does not contend\nThat no one under heaven can contend with him.\nThe ancient saying, “To yield is to be preserved whole,”\nIs no empty phrase.\nTruly, to be preserved whole is to return to it.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three**\nRare words are natural.\nFierce winds do not last the morning;\nTorrential rains do not last the day.\nWho brings these about?\nHeaven and earth.\nIf even heaven and earth cannot endure for long,\nHow much less can man?\nThus, those who act in accordance with the Dao\nAre one with the Dao;\nThose who are one with virtue\nAre one with virtue;\nThose who are one with loss\nAre one with loss.\nWhere trust is insufficient,\nThere will be distrust.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four**\nOne who stands on tiptoe does not stand firm;\nOne who strides cannot walk far;\nOne who sees himself is not enlightened;\nOne who asserts himself is not distinguished;\nOne who boasts achieves no merit;\nOne who prides himself does not endure.\nIn the Way, these are called\n“Excess food and redundant deeds,”\nWhich some find detestable.\nTherefore, those who possess the Dao do not abide in them.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five**\nThere is a thing, formless yet complete,\nBorn before heaven and earth.\n\nSilent and void! It stands alone, unchanging,\nCircling endlessly without peril,\nIt may be called the Mother of all under heaven.\nI know not its name,\nSo I style it \"Dao,\"\nAnd forcibly name it \"Great.\"\nGreat means it flows ever onward,\nFlowing ever onward means it goes far,\nGoing far means it returns.\nThus the Dao is great,\nHeaven is great,\nEarth is great,\nAnd the king is great.\nWithin the realm, there are four greats,\nAnd the king occupies one of them.\nMan models himself on earth,\nEarth models itself on heaven,\nHeaven models itself on the Dao,\nAnd the Dao models itself on spontaneity.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six**\nGravity is the root of lightness,\nStillness the ruler of restlessness.\nThus the noble person travels all day\nYet never strays from the baggage wagon,\nThough there be splendid sights,\nHe dwells in serene detachment.\nHow can the lord of ten thousand chariots\nTreat his person lightly before all under heaven?\nLightness loses the ministers,\nRestlessness loses the ruler.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven**\nThe skilled traveler leaves no tracks;\nThe skilled speaker makes no flaws;\nThe skilled reckoner needs no counting rods;\nThe skilled closer needs no bolts yet none can open;\nThe skilled binder needs no cords yet none can untie.\nThus the sage is always skilled at saving people,\nAnd so abandons no one;\nAlways skilled at saving things,\nAnd so abandons nothing.\nThis is called inheriting enlightenment.\nThe good person is the teacher of the bad;\nThe bad person is the resource of the good.\nOne who does not value the teacher\nOr cherish the resource,\nThough wise, is greatly deluded.\nThis is called the essential mystery.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight**\nKnow the masculine, hold to the feminine,\nBecome the world’s stream.\nAs the world’s stream,\nConstant virtue never departs,\nAnd one returns to infancy.\nKnow the white, hold to the black,\nBecome the world’s pattern.\nAs the world’s pattern,\nConstant virtue never errs,\nAnd one returns to the boundless.\nKnow the glorious, hold to the humble,\nBecome the world’s valley.\nAs the world’s valley,\nConstant virtue is ever sufficient,\nAnd one returns to simplicity.\nWhen simplicity is scattered, it becomes vessels,\nAnd the sage employs it as the chief of officials.\nThus the great system makes no cuts.\n\nHe who would take the world and act upon it,\nI see that he will not succeed.\nThe world is a sacred vessel—\nIt cannot be acted upon.\nWho acts upon it destroys it;\nWho grasps it loses it.\n\nFor things sometimes lead and sometimes follow,\nSometimes breathe gently and sometimes blow,\nSometimes are strong and sometimes weak,\nSometimes endure and sometimes collapse.\nTherefore the sage discards the excessive,\nThe extravagant, the extreme.\n\n**Chapter Thirty**\nOne who rules men by the Dao\nDoes not use force to dominate the world,\nFor such things are wont to rebound:\nWhere armies march, thorns and brambles grow.\nThus the good commander achieves his aim and stops,\nWithout resorting to force.\nHe achieves his aim but does not boast,\nAchieves his aim but does not vaunt,\nAchieves his aim but does not exult,\nAchieves his aim but does not presume—\nThis is to achieve one’s aim without force.\nWhen things reach their prime, they age;\nThis is called “not the Dao.”\nWhat is not the Dao soon ends.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One**\nFine weapons are ill-omened tools—\nThings may detest them,\nThus the man of Dao does not abide by them.\nThe noble man at home honors the left,\nBut in war honors the right.\nWeapons are ill-omened tools,\nNot the tools of the noble man.\nOnly when unavoidable does he use them,\nAnd he does so with calm restraint.\nHe does not glorify them;\nTo glorify them is to delight in killing.\nOne who delights in killing\nCannot achieve his will in the world.\nThus in auspicious affairs, the left is honored;\nIn inauspicious affairs, the right is honored.\nTherefore the lieutenant general stands on the left,\nThe supreme general on the right.\nWhen many are killed, one mourns them with sorrow;\nWhen victorious in battle, one observes it with mourning rites.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two**\nThe Dao is eternally nameless.\n\nThe uncarved block, though small,\nNo one in the world dares claim as subject.\nIf kings and lords could hold to it,\nThe ten thousand things would of themselves submit.\n\nHeaven and earth unite,\nTo send down sweet dew—\nNone commands it, yet it falls evenly of itself.\n\nOnce names are established, there are bounds.\nWhen names already exist,\nHeaven knows where to halt.\nKnowing where to halt, one avoids peril.\n\nThe Dao in the world\nIs like streams and valleys to rivers and seas.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three**\nTo know others is wisdom;\nTo know oneself is clarity.\nTo conquer others requires force;\nTo conquer oneself is strength.\nTo know contentment is wealth;\nTo act with vigor is resolve.\nNot losing one’s place endures;\nDying yet not perishing is longevity.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Four**\nThe great Dao flows everywhere,\nTo left and right alike.\nThe ten thousand things depend on it to live, yet it does not refuse them;\nIts work is accomplished, yet it claims no possession.\nIt nurtures the ten thousand things yet does not act as their master—\nIt may be called great.\nThus the sage never strives to be great,\nAnd thereby achieves greatness.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Five**\nHold to the great image,\nAnd all under heaven will come.\nThey come and are not harmed,\nBut find peace, safety, and great tranquility.\n\nMusic and fine food\nMay make the passing traveler pause.\nBut the Dao, when spoken,\nIs bland and without flavor—\nTo see, it is not enough to be seen;\nTo hear, it is not enough to be heard;\nYet its use is inexhaustible.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Six**\nTo gather it in, one must first expand it;\nTo weaken it, one must first strengthen it;\n\nTo enfeeble it, one must first fortify it;\nTo abolish it, one must first establish it;\nTo seize it, one must first grant it.\nThis is called subtle illumination.\nThe soft overcomes the hard,\nThe weak overcomes the strong.\nFish must not leave the depths;\nThe state’s sharp instruments must not be shown to others.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven**\nThe Dao constantly takes no action, yet nothing is left undone.\nIf lords and kings can hold to it,\nThe ten thousand things will transform of themselves.\nWhen transformation stirs and desire arises,\nI will press it down with the nameless uncarved block.\nThe nameless uncarved block—\nIt too will be free of desire.\nWithout desire, through stillness,\nAll under heaven will right itself.\n\n**Laozi’s Virtue Classic**\n*Tang Dynasty Yizhou Longxing Temple Stele of the Daodejing*\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Eight**\nHighest virtue does not act as virtue,\nAnd so possesses virtue.\nLesser virtue does not lose virtue,\nAnd so lacks virtue.\nHighest virtue takes no action and has no purpose;\nLesser virtue takes no action yet has purpose.\nHighest benevolence acts yet has no purpose;\nHighest righteousness acts yet has purpose.\nHighest propriety acts, and when none respond,\nIt rolls up its sleeves and forces compliance.\nThus, when the Dao is lost, virtue follows;\nWhen virtue is lost, benevolence follows;\nWhen benevolence is lost, righteousness follows;\nWhen righteousness is lost, propriety follows.\nPropriety is the thinning of loyalty and trust,\nAnd the beginning of disorder.\nForeknowledge is the flower of the Dao,\nAnd the beginning of folly.\nTherefore the great person dwells in the substantial, not the superficial,\nIn the fruit, not the flower.\nThus they discard that and take this.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine**\nOf old, those who attained the One:\nHeaven attained the One and became clear;\nEarth attained the One and became stable;\nThe spirits attained the One and became numinous;\nThe valleys attained the One and became full;\nThe ten thousand things attained the One and came to life;\nLords and kings attained the One and became the standard for all under heaven.\nIf heaven were not clear, it would fear splitting;\nIf earth were not stable, it would fear erupting;\n\nSpirits without the numinous will fear dissipation;\nValleys without fullness will fear exhaustion;\nThe ten thousand things without life will fear annihilation;\nLords and kings without steadfast virtue will fear collapse.\nThus the noble takes the lowly as its root,\nThe high takes the low as its foundation.\nTherefore lords and kings call themselves \"the orphaned,\" \"the widowed,\" \"the unworthy\"—\nIs this not taking the lowly as their root?\n\nHence, when carriages are counted, there are no carriages.\nNot desiring to gleam like jade,\nNor to clatter like stone.\n\n**Chapter Forty**\nReversion is the movement of the Dao,\nWeakness is the function of the Dao.\nThe ten thousand things under heaven are born of being,\nBeing is born of non-being.\n\n**Chapter Forty-One**\nWhen the highest scholar hears of the Dao, they diligently practice it;\nWhen the middling scholar hears of the Dao, they hold it as if it exists, as if it does not;\nWhen the lowest scholar hears of the Dao, they laugh loudly at it.\nIf it were not laughed at, it would not be the Dao.\nThus the established sayings have it:\nThe luminous Dao seems obscure,\nAdvancing in the Dao seems like retreat,\nThe level Dao seems uneven,\nSupreme virtue seems like a valley,\nGreat purity seems sullied,\nAbundant virtue seems insufficient,\nEstablished virtue seems lax,\nTrue substance seems mutable,\nThe great square has no corners,\nThe great vessel is late in completion,\nThe great sound is scarce of voice,\nThe great image has no form.\nThe Dao is hidden and nameless.\nOnly the Dao is good at bestowing and good at completing.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Two**\nThe Dao gives birth to the One,\nThe One gives birth to the Two,\nThe Two give birth to the Three,\nThe Three give birth to the ten thousand things.\nThe ten thousand things carry yin and embrace yang,\nBlending their qi to attain harmony.\nWhat people despise are \"the orphaned,\" \"the widowed,\" \"the unworthy,\"\nYet kings and dukes use these as their titles.\nThus things may be diminished yet increased,\nOr increased yet diminished.\nWhat others teach, I also teach:\n\"The violent do not meet a natural death\"—\nI will take this as the father of my teaching.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Three**\nThe softest under heaven gallops through the hardest under heaven.\nNon-being enters where there is no space.\nThus I know the benefit of non-action.\nTeaching without words,\nBenefit without action—\nFew under heaven attain these.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Four**\nFame or self—which is dearer?\nSelf or wealth—which is greater?\nGain or loss—which is more harmful?\nThus excessive love incurs great cost,\nAbundant hoarding incurs heavy loss.\nKnow contentment and you will not be disgraced,\nKnow when to stop and you will not be imperiled—\nThus you may endure long.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Five**\nGreat perfection seems flawed, yet its use is inexhaustible;\nGreat fullness seems empty, yet its use is boundless.\nGreat straightness seems bent,\nGreat skill seems clumsy,\nGreat eloquence seems inarticulate.\nMovement overcomes cold,\nStillness overcomes heat.\nPurity and stillness set the standard for all under heaven.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Six**\nWhen the world follows the Dao,\nWarhorses are retired to fertilize fields;\nWhen the world loses the Dao,\nMilitary horses breed in the suburbs.\nNo crime is greater than indulging desire,\nNo disaster is greater than not knowing contentment,\nNo fault is greater than covetousness.\nThus the contentment of knowing contentment is constant contentment.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Seven**\nWithout stepping outside, one knows all under heaven;\nWithout looking through the window, one sees the Dao of heaven.\nThe farther one goes, the less one knows.\nThus the sage knows without traveling,\nNames without seeing,\nAccomplishes without acting.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Eight**\nIn the pursuit of learning, one gains daily;\nIn the pursuit of the Dao, one loses daily.\nLosing and yet again losing,\nOne reaches non-action.\nThrough non-action, nothing is left undone.\nTo govern all under heaven, one must always act without interference;\nWhen there is interference, it is no longer sufficient to govern all under heaven.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Nine**\nThe sage has no fixed mind,\nTaking the people’s mind as their own.\nThe good I treat as good,\nThe not-good I also treat as good—thus attaining goodness.\nThe trustworthy I trust,\nThe untrustworthy I also trust—thus attaining trust.\nThe sage in the world is cautious,\nFor the world, they harmonize their mind.\nThe people all fix their ears and eyes upon them,\nAnd the sage treats them all like children.\n\n**Chapter Fifty**\nEmerging into life, entering into death.\nOf those who follow life, three in ten;\nOf those who follow death, three in ten;\nOf those who move toward the realm of death, three in ten.\nWhy is this so?\nBecause of the thickness of their life-nurturing.\nIt is said that those who are good at preserving life\nDo not meet rhinoceroses or tigers on land,\nNor are they struck by weapons in battle.\nThe rhinoceros has no place to thrust its horn,\nThe tiger has no place to sink its claws,\nWeapons have no place to lodge their blades.\nWhy is this so?\nBecause there is no realm of death in them.\n\nI have heard that those skilled in nurturing life\nDo not encounter tigers or rhinoceroses when traveling on land,\nNor are they struck by armor or weapons when entering battle.\nThe rhinoceros has no place to thrust its horn,\nThe tiger has no place to sink its claws,\nWeapons have no place to lodge their blades.\nWhy is this so?\nBecause there is no realm of death in them.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-One**\nThe Dao gives them life,\nVirtue nourishes them,\nThings shape them,\nCircumstances complete them.\nThus the myriad things all revere the Dao and honor virtue.\nThe Dao is revered, virtue is honored—\nYet none commands this, for it is always so of itself.\nTherefore the Dao gives them life,\nVirtue nourishes them,\nRears them, cultivates them,\nMatures them, ripens them,\nSustains them, shelters them.\nIt gives life yet does not possess,\nActs yet does not rely,\nLeads yet does not dominate—\nThis is called profound virtue.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Two**\nThe world has a beginning,\nWhich is the mother of the world.\nOnce you know the mother,\nYou also know the child.\nOnce you know the child,\nReturn to guard the mother.\nThus you will not perish to the end of your days.\nBlock the openings, shut the gates,\nAnd to the end of your days you will not toil.\nOpen the openings, meddle in affairs,\nAnd to the end of your days you will not be saved.\nSeeing the small is called clarity,\nGuarding the soft is called strength.\nUse its light,\nReturn to its clarity,\nAnd you will leave no misfortune for yourself—\nThis is called practicing the constant.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Three**\nIf I had but a little knowledge,\nI would walk the great Dao,\nFearing only to stray.\nThe great Dao is smooth,\nYet people prefer byways.\nThe court is well swept,\nThe fields are overgrown,\nThe granaries are empty,\nYet they wear embroidered robes,\nCarry sharp swords,\nSurfeit themselves with food and drink,\nAnd hoard excess wealth—\nThis is called the boast of thieves.\nHow far is this from the Dao!\n\nThe well-established cannot be uprooted,\nThe well-embracing cannot be loosed—\nThus descendants’ sacrifices never cease.\nCultivate it in the self, and its virtue is genuine;\nCultivate it in the family, and its virtue overflows;\nCultivate it in the village, and its virtue endures;\nCultivate it in the state, and its virtue abounds;\nCultivate it in the world, and its virtue is universal.\nTherefore:\nObserve the self through the self,\nObserve the family through the family,\nObserve the village through the village,\nObserve the state through the state,\nObserve the world through the world.\nHow do I know the world is so?\nBy this.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Five**\nOne whose virtue is deeply rooted\nIs like a newborn babe:\nPoisonous insects do not sting,\nFierce beasts do not seize,\nBirds of prey do not strike.\nThough bones are weak and sinews soft, the grasp is firm.\nNot knowing the union of female and male, the organ stirs—\nSuch is the perfection of essence.\nCrying all day without hoarseness—\nSuch is the perfection of harmony.\nTo know harmony is called the constant,\nTo know the constant is called clarity.\nTo augment life is called ill-omened,\nTo let the mind command the qi is called force.\nWhen things reach their prime, they age—\nThis is called not-Dao.\nNot-Dao perishes early.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Six**\nThose who know do not speak,\nThose who speak do not know.\nBlock the openings, shut the gates,\nBlunt the sharpness, untangle the knots,\nSoften the glare, merge with the dust—\nThis is called profound sameness.\nThus:\nIt cannot be made close,\nNor can it be made distant;\nIt cannot be benefited,\nNor can it be harmed;\nIt cannot be exalted,\nNor can it be debased.\nTherefore, it is honored by the world.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Seven**\nGovern the state with uprightness,\nDeploy troops with craft,\nWin the world through non-interference.\nHow do I know this is so?\nBy this.\n\nThe world abounds with taboos,\nAnd the people grow ever poorer;\nThe people wield many sharp tools,\nAnd the state sinks deeper into chaos;\nThe people cultivate many skills and arts,\nAnd strange things proliferate;\nLaws and regulations grow ever more prominent,\nAnd thieves and bandits multiply.\nThus the sage declares:\n“I practice non-action, and the people transform of themselves;\nI cherish stillness, and the people rectify themselves;\nI engage in no affairs, and the people prosper of themselves;\nI harbor no desires, and the people return to simplicity.”\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Eight**\nWhen governance is dull and unrefined,\nThe people are honest and sincere;\nWhen governance is sharp and exacting,\nThe people are lacking and flawed.\nMisfortune—fortune leans upon it;\nFortune—misfortune lurks within it.\nWho knows their ultimate end?\nThere is no fixed standard.\nThe upright reverts to the strange,\nThe good reverts to the ominous.\nThe people’s delusion has endured for long indeed.\nThus the sage is square but does not cut,\nHas edges but does not harm,\nIs straight but not overbearing,\nIs bright but does not dazzle.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Nine**\nIn governing people and serving Heaven,\nNothing surpasses frugality.\nOnly through frugality can one attain early compliance—\nEarly compliance is called the repeated accumulation of virtue.\nWith repeated accumulation of virtue, there is nothing one cannot overcome;\nHaving nothing one cannot overcome, none can know one’s limits.\nWith no known limits, one can possess the state.\nPossessing the mother of the state,\nOne can endure long.\nThis is called the Dao of deep roots, firm foundation,\nLong life, and enduring vision.\n\n**Chapter Sixty**\nGoverning a great state is like cooking a small fish.\nWhen the Dao presides over the world,\nIts ghosts lose their numinosity.\nNot that its ghosts lose their numinosity,\nBut their numinosity does no harm to people.\nNot that their numinosity does no harm,\nBut the sage also does no harm.\nAs neither harms the other,\nVirtue converges in them.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-One**\nA great state is the lower reaches,\nThe confluence of the world,\nThe female of the world.\nThe male constantly overcomes the female through stillness,\nUsing stillness as the lower position.\nThus a great state, by lowering itself before a small state,\nWins over the small state;\nA small state, by lowering itself before a great state,\nWins over the great state.\nThus some lower themselves to win,\nOthers lower themselves and win.\nA great state desires nothing more than to unite and nurture people;\nA small state desires nothing more than to enter into the service of others.\nWhen both attain what they desire,\nThe greater must be the one to lower itself.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Two**\nThe Dao is the mystery of the myriad things.\nIt is the treasure of the good,\nThe refuge of the not-good.\nFine words can purchase honor,\nNoble deeds can elevate a person.\nEven if a person is not good,\nWhy should they be cast aside?\nThus, when establishing the Son of Heaven\nOr appointing the Three Ministers,\nThough one may offer large jade disks followed by teams of four horses,\nIt is better to sit and present this Dao.\nWhy did the ancients value this Dao?\nDid they not say:\n“Seek, and you shall obtain;\nHave faults, and you shall be spared”?\nTherefore, it is honored by the world.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Three**\nAct through non-action,\nAttend to no-affairs,\nTaste the tasteless.\nWhether great or small, many or few,\nRepay resentment with virtue.\nResolve difficulties while they are easy,\nAchieve greatness in small matters.\nThe difficult affairs of the world\nMust begin with what is easy;\nThe great affairs of the world\nMust begin with what is small.\nThus the sage never strives for greatness,\nAnd thereby achieves greatness.\nOne who makes promises lightly is seldom trusted;\nOne who takes things lightly incurs many difficulties.\nThus the sage treats things as difficult,\nAnd therefore never encounters difficulty.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Four**\nWhat is at rest is easy to hold,\nWhat has not yet shown signs is easy to plan for,\nWhat is fragile is easy to break,\nWhat is minute is easy to scatter.\nAct before things exist,\nGovern before disorder arises.\nA tree as wide as a man’s embrace grows from a tiny shoot;\nA terrace of nine layers rises from a basket of earth;\nA journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.\nThose who act will fail,\nThose who grasp will lose.\nThus the sage practices non-action and does not fail,\nHolds nothing and does not lose.\nIn their undertakings,\nPeople often fail when near completion.\nBe as careful at the end as at the beginning,\nAnd there will be no failures.\nThus the sage desires what others do not desire,\nDoes not value rare goods;\nLearns what others do not learn,\nAnd returns from where the multitude has erred.\nThus they assist the self-so of the myriad things\nAnd dare not act.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Five**\nThe ancients who were skilled in the Dao\nDid not use it to enlighten the people,\nBut to make them simple.\nThe people are difficult to govern\nBecause they are too clever.\nThus to govern the state with cleverness\nIs the state’s ruin;\nNot to govern the state with cleverness\nIs the state’s blessing.\nKnowing these two is also a model.\nAlways knowing this model\nIs called profound virtue.\nProfound virtue is deep and far-reaching,\nOpposed to things, yet ultimately in great accord.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Six**\nThe reason rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys\nIs that they excel at lying low.\nThus they can be kings of the hundred valleys.\nTherefore, if the sage wishes to be above the people,\nThey must speak as though below them;\nIf they wish to lead the people,\nThey must place themselves behind.\nThus the sage dwells above, yet the people do not feel burdened;\nDwells in front, yet the people do not feel harmed.\nThus the world delights in supporting them and does not tire.\nBecause they do not contend,\nNo one in the world can contend with them.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Seven**\nThe world all says I am great, unlike others.\nIt is precisely because I am great that I am unlike others.\nIf I were like others, I would long since have been small!\nI possess three treasures that I hold and cherish:\nThe first is compassion,\nThe second is frugality,\nThe third is not daring to be first in the world.\nCompassionate, thus able to be courageous;\nFrugal, thus able to be expansive;\nNot daring to be first in the world,\nThus able to become the chief of all vessels.\nNow, to abandon compassion yet claim courage,\nAbandon frugality yet claim expansiveness,\nAbandon the last yet claim the first—\nThis is death.\nCompassion—\nIn battle, it brings victory;\nIn defense, it brings solidity.\nHeaven will save them,\nAnd protect them with compassion.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Eight**\nThe ancients who were skilled as warriors were not martial,\nThose skilled in battle were not enraged,\nThose who excelled in defeating enemies did not contend,\nThose who excelled in employing others placed themselves below.\nThis is called the virtue of non-contention,\nThe use of others’ strength,\nThe matching of Heaven’s ancient standard.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Nine**\nIn the use of arms, there is a saying:\n“I dare not be the host but act as the guest,\nDare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.”\nThis is called marching without marching,\nRaising arms without arms,\nGrasping without weapons,\nConfronting without enemies.\nNo disaster is greater than underestimating the enemy;\nUnderestimating the enemy nearly costs me my treasures.\nThus when evenly matched armies clash,\nThe side that grieves will win.\n\n**Chapter Seventy**\nMy words are very easy to know,\nVery easy to practice.\n\nThe world knows not, nor can it practice.\nWords have their source, affairs have their lord.\nOnly through ignorance do they not know me.\nThose who know me are rare, thus I am precious.\nTherefore the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-One**\nTo know yet think one does not know is superior;\nNot to know yet think one knows is a flaw.\nTherefore the sage is not flawed.\nBecause he takes the flaw as a flaw,\nHe is thus without flaw.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Two**\nWhen the people do not fear authority,\nGreater authority will come.\nDo not constrict their dwelling,\nDo not oppress their livelihood.\nOnly by not oppressing them will they not be oppressed.\nTherefore the sage knows himself but does not display himself,\nLoves himself but does not exalt himself.\nThus he discards that and takes this.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Three**\nBold in daring, one is killed;\nBold in not daring, one lives.\nOf these two, one brings benefit, the other harm.\nWhat Heaven detests—who knows the reason?\nThe Way of Heaven:\nExcels in victory without contention,\nResponds well without speech,\nComes of itself without summons,\nIs unhurried yet excels in planning.\nHeaven’s net is vast and wide,\nSparse yet nothing slips through.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Four**\nIf the people do not fear death,\nHow can death be used to frighten them?\nIf one could make them constantly fear death,\nAnd those who act strangely were seized and killed,\nWho would dare?\nThere is always an executioner who kills.\nTo kill in place of the executioner\nIs like hewing in place of the master carpenter.\nFew who hew in place of the master carpenter\nDo not injure their own hands.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Five**\nThe people’s hunger\nComes from their superiors consuming too much in taxes—\nThus they hunger.\nThe people’s difficulty in being governed\nComes from their superiors’ meddling—\nThus they are difficult to govern.\nThe people’s disregard for death\nComes from their pursuit of excessive life—\nThus they disregard death.\nOnly those who do not strive for life\nAre wiser than those who value life.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Six**\nIn life, humans are soft and weak;\nIn death, they are stiff and strong.\nAll things, plants and trees—\nIn life, they are soft and fragile;\nIn death, they are withered and dry.\nThus the stiff and strong are companions of death,\nThe soft and weak are companions of life.\nTherefore when armies are strong, they do not prevail;\nWhen trees are strong, they are felled.\nThus the strong and stiff dwell below,\nThe soft and weak dwell above.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Seven**\nThe Way of Heaven—\nIs it not like drawing a bow?\nThe high is pressed down, the low is raised,\nThe excessive is reduced, the deficient is supplemented.\nThe Way of Heaven:\nReduces the excessive to supplement the deficient.\nThe way of humans is not so—\nIt reduces the deficient to serve the excessive.\nWho can have excess to offer the world?\nOnly those with the Dao.\nTherefore the sage acts but does not rely,\nAchieves success but does not dwell in it,\nAnd thus does not display his worth.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Eight**\nNothing in the world is softer or weaker than water,\nYet in attacking the hard and strong,\nNothing surpasses it.\nNothing can take its place.\nThus the weak overcomes the strong,\nThe soft overcomes the hard—\nYet none in the world know this,\nNone can practice it.\nTherefore the sage says:\n“One who bears the nation’s disgrace\nIs called the lord of the altars of soil and grain;\nOne who bears the nation’s misfortune\nIs called the king of all under Heaven.”\nTrue words seem paradoxical.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Nine**\n\nTo reconcile great resentment,\nThere must remain lingering resentment—\nHow can this be called good?\nTherefore the sage holds the left tally\nYet does not demand from others.\nThus those with virtue oversee the tally,\nThose without virtue oversee exactions.\nThe Way of Heaven shows no partiality,\nYet it ever bestows on the good.\n\n**Chapter Eighty**\nLet the state be small, its people few,\nSo that though there be tools for tens and hundreds,\nThey are not used.\nLet the people regard death as weighty\nAnd not wander far.\nThough there be boats and carriages,\nNone ride in them;\nThough there be armor and weapons,\nNone array them.\nLet the people return to knotting cords for use.\nSweet be their food,\nFair their clothing,\nSecure their dwellings,\nJoyful their customs.\nNeighboring states may be within sight,\nThe sounds of their chickens and dogs heard,\nYet the people grow old and die\nWithout ever visiting one another.\n\n**Chapter Eighty-One**\nTruthful words are not fine,\nFine words are not truthful.\nThe good do not dispute,\nThe disputatious are not good.\nThe wise are not broadly learned,\nThe broadly learned are not wise.\nThe sage does not accumulate—\nThe more he does for others, the more he has;\nThe more he gives to others, the more he possesses.\nThe Way of Heaven benefits and does not harm.\nThe Way of the sage acts and does not contend.",

      "translated_text": "The world abounds with taboos,\nAnd the people grow ever poorer;\nThe people wield many sharp tools,\nAnd the state sinks deeper into chaos;\nThe people cultivate many skills and arts,\nAnd strange things proliferate;\nLaws and regulations grow ever more prominent,\nAnd thieves and bandits multiply.\nThus the sage declares:\n“I practice non-action, and the people transform of themselves;\nI cherish stillness, and the people rectify themselves;\nI engage in no affairs, and the people prosper of themselves;\nI harbor no desires, and the people return to simplicity.”\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Eight**\nWhen governance is dull and unrefined,\nThe people are honest and sincere;\nWhen governance is sharp and exacting,\nThe people are lacking and flawed.\nMisfortune—fortune leans upon it;\nFortune—misfortune lurks within it.\nWho knows their ultimate end?\nThere is no fixed standard.\nThe upright reverts to the strange,\nThe good reverts to the ominous.\nThe people’s delusion has endured for long indeed.\nThus the sage is square but does not cut,\nHas edges but does not harm,\nIs straight but not overbearing,\nIs bright but does not dazzle.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Nine**\nIn governing people and serving Heaven,\nNothing surpasses frugality.\nOnly through frugality can one attain early compliance—\nEarly compliance is called the repeated accumulation of virtue.\nWith repeated accumulation of virtue, there is nothing one cannot overcome;\nHaving nothing one cannot overcome, none can know one’s limits.\nWith no known limits, one can possess the state.\nPossessing the mother of the state,\nOne can endure long.\nThis is called the Dao of deep roots, firm foundation,\nLong life, and enduring vision.\n\n**Chapter Sixty**\nGoverning a great state is like cooking a small fish.\nWhen the Dao presides over the world,\nIts ghosts lose their numinosity.\nNot that its ghosts lose their numinosity,\nBut their numinosity does no harm to people.\nNot that their numinosity does no harm,\nBut the sage also does no harm.\nAs neither harms the other,\nVirtue converges in them.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-One**\nA great state is the lower reaches,\nThe confluence of the world,\nThe female of the world.\nThe male constantly overcomes the female through stillness,\nUsing stillness as the lower position.\nThus a great state, by lowering itself before a small state,\nWins over the small state;\nA small state, by lowering itself before a great state,\nWins over the great state.\nThus some lower themselves to win,\nOthers lower themselves and win.\nA great state desires nothing more than to unite and nurture people;\nA small state desires nothing more than to enter into the service of others.\nWhen both attain what they desire,\nThe greater must be the one to lower itself.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Two**\nThe Dao is the mystery of the myriad things.\nIt is the treasure of the good,\nThe refuge of the not-good.\nFine words can purchase honor,\nNoble deeds can elevate a person.\nEven if a person is not good,\nWhy should they be cast aside?\nThus, when establishing the Son of Heaven\nOr appointing the Three Ministers,\nThough one may offer large jade disks followed by teams of four horses,\nIt is better to sit and present this Dao.\nWhy did the ancients value this Dao?\nDid they not say:\n“Seek, and you shall obtain;\nHave faults, and you shall be spared”?\nTherefore, it is honored by the world.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Three**\nAct through non-action,\nAttend to no-affairs,\nTaste the tasteless.\nWhether great or small, many or few,\nRepay resentment with virtue.\nResolve difficulties while they are easy,\nAchieve greatness in small matters.\nThe difficult affairs of the world\nMust begin with what is easy;\nThe great affairs of the world\nMust begin with what is small.\nThus the sage never strives for greatness,\nAnd thereby achieves greatness.\nOne who makes promises lightly is seldom trusted;\nOne who takes things lightly incurs many difficulties.\nThus the sage treats things as difficult,\nAnd therefore never encounters difficulty.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Four**\nWhat is at rest is easy to hold,\nWhat has not yet shown signs is easy to plan for,\nWhat is fragile is easy to break,\nWhat is minute is easy to scatter.\nAct before things exist,\nGovern before disorder arises.\nA tree as wide as a man’s embrace grows from a tiny shoot;\nA terrace of nine layers rises from a basket of earth;\nA journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.\nThose who act will fail,\nThose who grasp will lose.\nThus the sage practices non-action and does not fail,\nHolds nothing and does not lose.\nIn their undertakings,\nPeople often fail when near completion.\nBe as careful at the end as at the beginning,\nAnd there will be no failures.\nThus the sage desires what others do not desire,\nDoes not value rare goods;\nLearns what others do not learn,\nAnd returns from where the multitude has erred.\nThus they assist the self-so of the myriad things\nAnd dare not act.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Five**\nThe ancients who were skilled in the Dao\nDid not use it to enlighten the people,\nBut to make them simple.\nThe people are difficult to govern\nBecause they are too clever.\nThus to govern the state with cleverness\nIs the state’s ruin;\nNot to govern the state with cleverness\nIs the state’s blessing.\nKnowing these two is also a model.\nAlways knowing this model\nIs called profound virtue.\nProfound virtue is deep and far-reaching,\nOpposed to things, yet ultimately in great accord.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Six**\nThe reason rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys\nIs that they excel at lying low.\nThus they can be kings of the hundred valleys.\nTherefore, if the sage wishes to be above the people,\nThey must speak as though below them;\nIf they wish to lead the people,\nThey must place themselves behind.\nThus the sage dwells above, yet the people do not feel burdened;\nDwells in front, yet the people do not feel harmed.\nThus the world delights in supporting them and does not tire.\nBecause they do not contend,\nNo one in the world can contend with them.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Seven**\nThe world all says I am great, unlike others.\nIt is precisely because I am great that I am unlike others.\nIf I were like others, I would long since have been small!\nI possess three treasures that I hold and cherish:\nThe first is compassion,\nThe second is frugality,\nThe third is not daring to be first in the world.\nCompassionate, thus able to be courageous;\nFrugal, thus able to be expansive;\nNot daring to be first in the world,\nThus able to become the chief of all vessels.\nNow, to abandon compassion yet claim courage,\nAbandon frugality yet claim expansiveness,\nAbandon the last yet claim the first—\nThis is death.\nCompassion—\nIn battle, it brings victory;\nIn defense, it brings solidity.\nHeaven will save them,\nAnd protect them with compassion.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Eight**\nThe ancients who were skilled as warriors were not martial,\nThose skilled in battle were not enraged,\nThose who excelled in defeating enemies did not contend,\nThose who excelled in employing others placed themselves below.\nThis is called the virtue of non-contention,\nThe use of others’ strength,\nThe matching of Heaven’s ancient standard.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Nine**\nIn the use of arms, there is a saying:\n“I dare not be the host but act as the guest,\nDare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.”\nThis is called marching without marching,\nRaising arms without arms,\nGrasping without weapons,\nConfronting without enemies.\nNo disaster is greater than underestimating the enemy;\nUnderestimating the enemy nearly costs me my treasures.\nThus when evenly matched armies clash,\nThe side that grieves will win.\n\n**Chapter Seventy**\nMy words are very easy to know,\nVery easy to practice.",

      "translated_text": "To reconcile great resentment,\nThere must remain lingering resentment—\nHow can this be called good?\nTherefore the sage holds the left tally\nYet does not demand from others.\nThus those with virtue oversee the tally,\nThose without virtue oversee exactions.\nThe Way of Heaven shows no partiality,\nYet it ever bestows on the good.\n\n**Chapter Eighty**\nLet the state be small, its people few,\nSo that though there be tools for tens and hundreds,\nThey are not used.\nLet the people regard death as weighty\nAnd not wander far.\nThough there be boats and carriages,\nNone ride in them;\nThough there be armor and weapons,\nNone array them.\nLet the people return to knotting cords for use.\nSweet be their food,\nFair their clothing,\nSecure their dwellings,\nJoyful their customs.\nNeighboring states may be within sight,\nThe sounds of their chickens and dogs heard,\nYet the people grow old and die\nWithout ever visiting one another.\n\n**Chapter Eighty-One**\nTruthful words are not fine,\nFine words are not truthful.\nThe good do not dispute,\nThe disputatious are not good.\nThe wise are not broadly learned,\nThe broadly learned are not wise.\nThe sage does not accumulate—\nThe more he does for others, the more he has;\nThe more he gives to others, the more he possesses.\nThe Way of Heaven benefits and does not harm.\nThe Way of the sage acts and does not contend.",
