  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Eight Hidden Earth Arts of the Cinnabar Radiance and Dao Essence**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Eight Hidden Earth Arts of the Cinnabar Radiance and Dao Essence*\n**Author:** Unknown, approximately dated to the Eastern Jin dynasty.\n**Classification:** A foundational scripture of the early Supreme Clarity (Shangqing) tradition.\n**Volume:** Two scrolls.\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Tradition*, Zhengyi Section, Part One.\n\n---\n\n### *The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Eight Hidden Earth Arts of the Cinnabar Radiance and Dao Essence, Scroll One*\n\n#### **The Eight Transformations of the Purple Clarity Flying Spirit Jade Talismans**\nThe Eight Arts of the Mysterious True Transformations of the Boundless Earth:\n1. Concealing the Shadow and Hiding the Form\n2. Riding the Void and Commanding the Empyrean\n3. Veiling the Spirit and Soaring through the Clouds\n4. Emerging from Being and Entering Non-Being\n5. Flying Spirits across the Eight Directions\n6. Dissolving the Form and Vanishing through Transformation\n7. Revolving the Dawn and Turning the Mysterious\n8. Concealing the Earth and Dancing in the Heavens\n\nThese are the wondrous arts of the Golden Terrace and Jade Chamber’s secret sanctum, stored within jade tablets, sealed with golden seals, attended by jade lads, and guarded by jade maidens—eight hundred each. The Most High Jade Dawn Lofty Sage Lord received them from the Nine Mysteries, and after seven thousand years, transmitted them to the Perfected of the Great Ultimate, the Eastern Flower Great Divinity Fangzhu Qingtong, the Divine King of Fusang’s Yang Valley, and the Perfected of Pure Emptiness. They swore a covenant in the Supreme Clarity, cutting gold as their oath.\n\nThose whose bodies bear these talismanic inscriptions may conceal themselves across the eight directions; those who cultivate these arts may ride the void and mount the radiance. They are transmitted orally and must not be recklessly passed on—children do not show them to fathers, ministers do not offer them to rulers. Their names are inscribed only upon golden tablets and jade registers. To lightly divulge these secret texts brings calamity upon the Seven Mysteries, reducing one’s spirit to a lowly ghost, filling the river sources with obstruction. As the divine perfected decree: guard them in secrecy and revere them.\n\n---\n\n#### **The First Art: Concealing the Form and Hiding the Shadow**\nOn the day of the Beginning of Spring, at dawn, enter the chamber and sit facing the northeast corner. Visualize a dense purple cloud descending from the northeast corner’s Gen Palace, filling the entire room until darkness envelops both within and without. After a long while, it transforms into a nine-colored beast, its form like phosphorescence, appearing before your eyes. Then, knock the teeth thirty-six times and softly intone the incantation:\n\n*\"Revolve the origin, transform the shadow,\nReflect the radiance of secluded orchids,\nEnvelop me in purple walls,\nConceal me within the golden fortress,\nMerge with the qi-root, reveal not my form.\"*\n\nUpon completion, swallow nine times and cease. Open your eyes—the cloud disperses. Then ingest the *Flying Spirit Jade Talisman*. After one year of cultivation, your form will perpetually remain hidden in the void. On days of peril, stand upon the Gen Palace, take soil from your life-destiny’s direction, and sprinkle it to shield yourself. As on the day of the Beginning of Spring, recite the incantation and visualize the qi enveloping you—no one will see you.\n\n**Yang Talisman**\n**Yin Talisman**\n\nThe *Flying Spirit Jade Talisman* was bestowed by the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate. After ingesting it for one year, your body will merge with the divine, transforming freely in all directions while your form remains concealed within the Jade Chamber. Its secret names must not be recorded in writing. On the day of the Beginning of Spring, face east to ingest the talisman, softly intoning the hidden names of the Eight Radiant Ones, and recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Heaven conceals, earth hides,\nThe two qi unite in harmony,\nWithin the Gen Palace’s mysterious chamber,\nOne may ascend the body.\nProclaim the name to the Upper Clarity,\nSwallow the numinous talisman—\nLet no blade or weapon\nDraw near to me.\"*\n\nThen ingest the talisman and swallow nine times before ceasing.\n\n**Second Method: Riding the Void and Commanding the Sky**\nOn the day of the Spring Equinox, enter the chamber at noon, face east, and close your eyes. Visualize a verdant cloud, dense as a flying wheel, descending from the Zhen Palace in the east to envelop the entire room, both within and without, until all is shrouded in darkness. After a long while, the azure qi transforms into a blue-green dragon, coiling around your body above your left ear. Knock the teeth thirty-six times and softly intone the incantation:\n\n*\"Ascend the mysterious, ride the wheel,\nRevolve through the eight palaces.\nSeated, I merge with others;\nRising, I enter the void.\nEnvelop me in the azure heavens,\nGuard me with the divine dragon.\nReveal my form in radiance,\nPierce the depths of darkness.\nSwallow the nine numina—\nAttain boundless perpetuity.\"*\n\nUpon completion, swallow nine times and cease, then open your eyes to ingest the talisman. After two years of cultivation, you will ride the void and command the sky. On days of peril, stand upon the Zhen Palace, take soil from your current year’s direction, and sprinkle it to shield yourself. As on the day of the Spring Equinox, recite the incantation and visualize the qi enveloping you—others will see only mist.\n\nAfter ingesting the *Flying Spirit Jade Talisman* for three years, you will ride the void and traverse the dawn. Its secret names must not be spoken to others. On the day of the Spring Equinox, face east to ingest the talisman, softly intone the hidden names of the Eight Radiant Ones, and recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Divine clarity, mysterious pivot,\nReflecting the flowing Upper Clarity,\nThe Primordial Effulgence shines,\nNames inscribed on the Jade Terrace.\nRide the void, step through the sky,\nAscend to the Flowery Court.\nCloud-dragons and bannered flags\nCome to attend my form.\"*\n\nThen ingest the talisman and swallow nine times before ceasing.\n\n**Third Method: Concealment and Soaring through the Heavens**\nOn the day of the Beginning of Summer, enter the chamber at noon, face southeast, and close your eyes. Visualize a crimson cloud like swirling smoke descending from the Xun Palace in the southeast to fill the room, both within and without, until all is shrouded in darkness. After a long while, the red qi transforms into a dark hare resting upon your chest and abdomen. Knock the teeth thirty-six times and softly intone the incantation:\n\n*\"The dark hare takes flight,\nPetitioning the Three Dawns.\nSweep away the clamor and obscurity,\nUnseal my pure essence.\nAscend the cloud chariot,\nQi descends as purple mist.\nThe myriad spirits bow their heads—\nAll prostrate before me.\"*\n\nUpon completion, open your eyes to ingest the talisman and swallow nine times before ceasing. After three years of cultivation, you will conceal yourself and soar through the heavens. On days of peril, stand to the left of the Xun Palace, swallow the fourteen qi, and take soil from the Grand Year’s direction to shield yourself. As on the day of the Beginning of Summer, recite the incantation and visualize the qi enveloping you—your form will merge with the mist.\n\nAfter ingesting the *Flying Spirit Jade Talisman* for three years, you will vanish into the mysterious heavens. On the day of the Beginning of Summer, face southeast to ingest the talisman, softly intone the hidden names of the Eight Radiant Ones, and recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Spirit flies through the nine heavens,\nPurple radiance illumines the rosy clouds.\nIngest and swallow the eight qi,\nExhale and inhale the six pinnacles.\nDivine perfection fills the inner,\nOuter desires dissolve.\nFreely roam in your form,\nAt ease in the imperial court.\"*\n\nThen ingest the talisman and swallow nine times before ceasing.\n\n**Fourth Method: Emerging from Existence and Entering Non-Existence**\nOn the day of the Summer Solstice, enter the chamber at noon, face south, and close your eyes. Visualize a dense, flourishing red qi descending from the Li Palace in the south to envelop the entire room, both within and without, until all is shrouded in darkness. After a long while, the crimson cloud transforms into a phoenix perched above your head. Knock the teeth thirty-six times and softly intone the incantation:\n\n*\"Crimson mist veils the mysterious,\nQi and essence flow in communion.\nThe nine paths transform—\nBecoming a phoenix.\nBestow upon me the true treasury,\nGrant me the jade nectar.\nExit through the Gate of Heaven,\nEnter through the Li Palace.\nSummon the cloud chariot,\nRide the void, mount the light.\"*\n\nUpon completion, swallow nine times and cease, then open your eyes to ingest the talisman. After four years of cultivation, you will traverse the boundless, emerging from existence and entering non-existence. On days of peril, stand to the left of the Li Palace, swallow the nine qi, and take soil from the ninth month’s direction to shield yourself. As on the day of the Summer Solstice, recite the incantation and visualize the red qi enveloping you—your body will become a blaze of fire.\n\nAfter ingesting the *Flying Spirit Jade Talisman* for four years, you will move through the mysterious void, emerging from darkness and entering non-being. On the day of the Summer Solstice, face south to ingest the talisman, softly intone the hidden names of the Eight Radiant Ones, and recite the incantation:\n\n*\"The Eight Radiant Ones attend me,\nAncestors of the celestial realm.\nMount the divine tiger,\nClasp the feathered scriptures.\nRoar and command the winds and clouds,\nBind and restrain the myriad spirits.\nEmerge from darkness, enter the void—\nNone shall fail to cross.\"*\n\nThen ingest the talisman and swallow nine times before ceasing.\n\n**Fifth Method: Flying Spirit in the Eight Directions**\nOn the day of the Beginning of Autumn, enter the chamber at dusk, face southwest, and close your eyes. Inwardly visualize a dense white qi like celestial mist descending from the Kun Palace in the southwest to fill the room, both within and without, until all is shrouded in darkness. After a long while, the white cloud transforms into a qilin standing before you. Knock the teeth thirty-six times and softly intone the incantation:\n\n*\"Gaze upward to receive the mysterious essence,\nSwallow the yellow blossom.\nFeathers sprout upon my body,\nLightly ascending to mount the rosy clouds.\nRoam and feast through the eight palaces—\nTen thousand myriad years without end.\"*\n\nUpon completion, swallow nine times and cease, then open your eyes to ingest the talisman. After five years of cultivation, you will ascend to the eight directions. On days of peril, stand at the Kun Gate, swallow thirty-six qi while facing upward, and take soil from the current day’s celestial stem direction to shield yourself. As on the day of the Beginning of Autumn, recite the incantation and visualize the white qi enveloping you—your body will transform into dew and mist, invisible to others.\n\nAfter ingesting the *Flying Spirit Jade Talisman* for five years, you will roam and feast through the eight palaces, emerging from and entering the void chambers. On the day of the Beginning of Autumn, face southwest to ingest the talisman, softly intone the hidden names of the Eight Radiant Ones, and recite the incantation:\n\nThe *Flying Spirit* transforms into radiant purple clarity, its form shifting into scaled coils. Ascending the dark net of the cosmos, it rides the void and mounts emptiness, joining my Seven Mysteries in feasting and roaming—aging at heaven’s extremity, resting at earth’s end. None but the Golden Tablet may seek me.\n\nThis done, ingest the talisman and cease after nine swallows.\n\n**Sixth Technique: Dissolving Form and Vanishing**\n\nOn the day of the Autumn Equinox, enter the chamber at the hour of *bu*, face west, and close your eyes. Inwardly visualize white clouds arising from the west at the *Dui* Palace, filling the room until darkness lingers. After a long while, the white clouds transform into a divine tiger at your right side. Then, strike your teeth thirty-six times and softly intone the incantation:\n\n*Dissolve form and vanish,\nPursue flight and tread the floating,\nFirst pay homage to the Jade Emperor,\nThen retreat to the Eight Peaks.\nDivide the body into ten thousand,\nFulfill every desire.\nIn an instant’s transformation,\nThe eight palaces are traversed.*\n\nThis done, cease after nine swallows, open your eyes, and ingest the talisman.\n\nAfter six years of cultivation, your form will dissolve and your shadow shift, moving freely through the eight directions at will. On days of peril, stand within the *Dui* Palace, visualize fire *qi* burning your body, swallow seven *qi* while facing upward, and take soil from the *bing* direction to shield yourself. Recite the incantation as above, and none will see you.\n\nAfter ingesting the *Flying Spirit Jade Talisman* for six years, your form will dissolve into ten thousand, your body transform into a thousand. On the day of the Autumn Equinox, face west to ingest the talisman, softly invoke the hidden names of the Eight Radiant Ones, and recite the incantation:\n\n*Mysterious reflection of the Nine Numinous,\nTrue qi pervades the subtle,\nDissolve form and scatter shadow,\nMount the dawn and ride the radiance,\nGaze through the eight palaces,\nEnter and exit the Purple Tenuity.*\n\nThis done, ingest the talisman and cease after nine swallows.\n\n**Seventh Technique: Revolving the Mysterious Mornings**\n\nOn the day of the Beginning of Winter, enter the chamber at the hour of *zi*, face northwest, and close your eyes. Inwardly visualize black clouds arising from the northwest at the *Qian* Palace, filling the room until darkness pervades within and without. After a long while, the black clouds transform into a *teng* serpent at your left foot. Then, strike your teeth thirty-six times and softly intone the incantation:\n\n*Great Yin’s Nine Mysteries,\nTransform into the *teng* serpent,\nRevolve the Five Stars,\nTurn the Seven Mechanisms.\nFeast above in the Mysterious Palace,\nThe Eight Radiant Ones shine together,\nIngest essence and exhale qi,\nForever without end or sorrow.*\n\nThis done, cease after nine swallows, open your eyes, and ingest the talisman.\n\nAfter seven years of cultivation, you will revolve the five mornings, entering and exiting without obstruction. On days of peril, stand within the *Qian* Palace, visualize black clouds covering your body, swallow twenty-five *qi* while facing upward, and take soil from the Heavenly Gate to shield yourself. Recite the incantation as in the Beginning of Winter text.\n\nAfter ingesting the *Flying Spirit Jade Talisman* for seven years, you will feast above in the Grand Clarity, revolve the five mornings, mount the dragon, and ascend the void. On the day of the Beginning of Winter, face northwest to ingest the talisman, softly invoke the hidden yin names of the Eight Radiant Ones, and recite the incantation:\n\n*The numinous talisman revolves seven times,\nRanked with golden tablets,\nAbove, revolve the Five Stars,\nBelow, turn the Seven Mysteries.\nThe eight techniques transform the radiance,\nEntering and exiting without obstruction,\nGrasping the register of primordial records,\nCommanding and restraining Mount Feng.*\n\nThis done, ingest the talisman and cease after nine swallows.\n\n**Eighth Technique: Concealing Earth and Dancing Heaven**\n\nOn the day of the Winter Solstice, enter the chamber at the hour of *zi*, face north, and inwardly visualize layered black clouds descending from the north at the *Kan* Palace, filling the room until darkness pervades within and without. After a long while, they transform into a dark tortoise at your right foot. Then, strike your teeth thirty-six times and softly intone the incantation:\n\n*The numinous talisman conceals the directions,\nHides earth and dances heaven,\nEscaping the Six Yins,\nRevealing the body in the Jade Wheel.\nMount the dragon and ride the mist,\nAscend to the Emperor’s Morn.*\n\nThis done, cease after nine swallows, open your eyes, and ingest the talisman.\n\nAfter eight years of cultivation, you will ascend the Jade Clarity Palace. On days of peril, stand upon the *Kan* Palace, visualize black clouds covering your body, swallow twenty-five *qi* while facing upward, and take soil from the Earthly Gate to shield yourself. Recite the incantation as in the Winter Solstice text.\n\nAfter ingesting the *Flying Spirit Jade Talisman* for eight years, you will ascend the Jade Clarity, moving and turning at will. On the day of the Winter Solstice, face north to ingest the talisman, invoke the hidden yin names of the Eight Radiant Ones, and recite the incantation:\n\n*The eight techniques’ wondrous methods,\nConceal the body and escape form,\nIngest the talisman and swallow qi,\nUnite with the true and merge with the numinous.\nFirst feast in the eight palaces,\nThen ascend the Jade Clarity,\nThe Seven Mysteries release and dissolve,\nReturning to youthful infancy.*\n\nThis done, ingest the talisman and cease after nine swallows.\n\nFor all who cultivate the eight techniques, seven days prior, observe abstinence, bathe, and burn incense. On the appointed day, enter the chamber and first chant the *Dispelling Demons* to restrain the myriad spirits, following the method precisely.\n\nIn cultivating the eight techniques, invoke the true names of the Eight Radiant Ones and the sixteen yin hidden names—all are the great kings of the eight palaces, who govern the offices of the perfected immortals. Knowing their names ensures that the resolve for immortal study remains unconfused, evil does not intrude, and you tread the celestial net, stepping upon the essence of the Five Stars. Then, the Eight Radiant Great Kings will oversee your conduct, descend your true radiance, and merge with your *qi*.\n\nThe first is *Xuan Chang*, the second *Xiu Ling*, the third *Fei Xuan*, the fourth *Yao Guang*, the fifth *Mo Wang*, the sixth *Fei Cang*, the seventh *He Meng*, the eighth *Tong Ling*—altogether sixteen hidden names. There are also yin hidden names, transmitted orally by the master.\n\nAfter one year of cultivation, you may escape the body;\nAfter two years, you may ride the void;\nAfter three years, you may conceal and vanish;\nAfter four years, you may enter nothingness;\nAfter five years, you may ascend the eight directions;\nAfter six years, dissolve form and vanish;\nAfter seven years, you may revolve the five mornings;\nAfter eight years, enter earth and ascend heaven.\n\nThose who persist in this practice will enter and exit the Emperor’s Morn, feast and ride the cloud chariots, roam and ascend the Grand Clarity.\n\nThe *Purple Clarity Wondrous Scroll* composed by the Most High—should you encounter this text, inscribe your name upon the Golden Tablet. Follow the mysterious regulations: after seven hundred years of transmission, once passed to eight individuals, seal it with the Golden Tablet upon the Five Peaks and compile it within the famous mountains.\n\nThe Flying Numinous Jade Talismans are to be offered in libation at midnight of one’s life-destiny day, facing north, kneeling in prayer—this ritual follows the same pattern as the *Numinous Flight of the Six Jia*. Its text is loftily wondrous, its oath profoundly binding. Prepare according to the Mysterious and True: forty feet of white silk, eighty feet of purple-patterned silk, and eight pairs of golden clasps, to serve as the formal covenant in place of a written pledge.\n\nThe bestower is called *Master*; the receiver, *Disciple*. Should one violate the regulations or betray the oath, their seven generations of ancestors will suffer the trials of the Wind Blade, while their own soul shall become a lowly ghost, enduring the Five Torments and Eight Calamities, never to be redeemed across ten thousand kalpas. Guard this secret with utmost care.\n\nHere ends the *Upper Scroll of the Upper Clarity Scripture of Cinnabar Radiance, Dao Essence, and the Eight Hidden Earth Arts*.\n*Lower Scroll of the Upper Clarity Scripture of Cinnabar Radiance, Dao Essence, and the Eight Hidden Earth Arts*?",

Visualize a crimson cloud like swirling smoke descending from the Xun Palace in the southeast to fill the room, both within and without, until all is shrouded in darkness. After a long while, the red qi transforms into a dark hare resting upon your chest and abdomen.

After four years of cultivation, you will traverse the boundless, emerging from existence and entering non-existence. On days of peril, stand to the left of the Li Palace, swallow the nine qi, and take soil from the ninth month’s direction to shield yourself.

Inwardly visualize a dense white qi like celestial mist descending from the Kun Palace in the southwest to fill the room, both within and without, until all is shrouded in darkness. After a long while, the white cloud transforms into a qilin standing before you. Knock the teeth thirty-six times and softly intone the incantation:\n\n*\"Gaze upward to receive the mysterious essence,\nSwallow the yellow blossom.\nFeathers sprout upon my body,\nLightly ascending to mount the rosy clouds.\nRoam and feast through the eight palaces—\nTen thousand myriad years without end.\"*\n\nUpon completion, swallow nine times and cease, then open your eyes to ingest the talisman. After five years of cultivation, you will ascend to the eight directions. On days of peril, stand at the Kun Gate, swallow thirty-six qi while facing upward, and take soil from the current day’s celestial stem direction to shield yourself.

Inwardly visualize white clouds arising from the west at the *Dui* Palace, filling the room until darkness lingers. After a long while, the white clouds transform into a divine tiger at your right side.
