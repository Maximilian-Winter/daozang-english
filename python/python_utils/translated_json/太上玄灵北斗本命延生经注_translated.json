  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Mysterious Numinous Northern Dipper Original Destiny Longevity Sutra with Commentary**\n\n**Title:** *The Supreme Mysterious Numinous Northern Dipper Original Destiny Longevity Sutra with Commentary*. Composed by the Song Daoist Fu Dongzhen. Centered on the inner cultivation of body and mind. In three fascicles. Base text from: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Wondrous Writings* section, *Jade Instructions* category.\n\n**Preface to The Supreme Mysterious Numinous Northern Dipper Original Destiny Longevity Sutra with Commentary**\n\nThe *Northern Dipper Sutra* was spoken by the Supreme Lord Lao and transmitted by the Han Celestial Master Tianyi. At that time, the sacred words proclaimed by Lord Lao were heard below by Celestial Master Tianyi, and thus the sutra was composed. How could one fail to embody the sagely teachings, embellishing them with literary grace, elucidating their hidden secrets, clarifying their aims and renunciations, and illuminating their subtle mechanisms of flourishing and decay?\n\nYet the verses of the sutra, often composed in parallel prose, have led some fools to conjecture: \"Its style resembles the works of the Han and Tang dynasties—surely it was composed by Celestial Master Du!\" If not Celestial Master Du, then it must be the work of Celestial Master Zhang. Such men, presuming upon the authority of these two Celestial Masters, dare to slander without evidence. Yet both Celestial Masters ascended in flight or dissolved in transformation, leaving behind writings of unparalleled elegance—how could they have produced such vulgar words?\n\nConsider the *Five Classics* and *Six Canons*, the books of the Hundred Schools, and the scriptures of the Buddhist tradition—if they were not composed by authors, how could they exist? Moreover, the Confucian texts, from antiquity to the present, have been endlessly annotated and revised, yet remain incomplete. How much more so the subtle and obscure words of the Dao, veiled in boundless mystery!\n\nThis sutra is recited by humans and devas alike, invoked for blessings and the aversion of calamities, and its efficacy is unfailing. Those who slander it are explicitly warned in the sutra: their destinies will sink into the six realms of rebirth, and they will lose their human form, a fate most lamentable, bringing such suffering upon themselves.\n\nDongzhen now composes this commentary to dispel the blasphemies of the ignorant and sever the roots of their delusion. Drawing upon the teachings of various scriptures and the words of former masters, I have elucidated them in detail, and further corroborated them with plain speech—this is to enlighten those of middling and lesser capacity. The superior and enlightened need not attend to it.\n\nRespectfully inscribed by Fu Dongzhen.\n\n---\n\n**The Supreme Mysterious Numinous Northern Dipper Original Destiny Longevity Sutra with Commentary, Fascicle One**\n*Commentary by Fu Dongzhen*\n\n\"Supreme\" (*tai*) denotes utmost greatness; \"highest\" (*shang*) signifies the most exalted. The term *taishang* (\"Supreme Highest\") signifies the greatest and most lofty. \"Mysterious\" (*xuan*) means subtle and wondrous; \"numinous\" (*ling*) refers to sagely transformation. As for the \"Northern Dipper,\" according to the *River Chart Sutra’s Lateral Correspondences Diagram*: the Northern Dipper is the essence-soul of the Nine Heavens, the spirit-soul of the Nine Earths, the wondrous image of the Nine Stars, and the majestic divinity of the Nine Provinces. \"Original destiny\" (*benming*) refers to the original destiny’s primordial alignment, which descends to the human realm six times each year to assess the transgressions and blessings of mortals. The *Longevity Sutra* is the path of cultivating the true.\n\nThe Three Qi of the Mysterious, Primordial, and Original: the Mysterious arises from Earth, the Primordial arises from humanity, and the Original arises from Heaven. Humanity models itself on Earth, Earth models itself on Heaven, Heaven models itself on the Dao, and the Dao models itself on spontaneity.\n\nHumanity models itself on Earth, hence it is called \"mysterious\" (*xuan*). Humanity is the most numinous of the myriad beings, hence it is called \"numinous\" (*ling*). The Dao generates the One, the One generates the Two, the Two generates the Three, and the Three generates the Nine. The Three Qi are the honor of Heaven and Earth, and the Nine Qi are the root of the myriad beings. The Northern Dipper resides in the Central Heaven, governing the Nine Qi. The Dao of Nine and One is unified in the Mysterious One.\n\nThe Mysterious arises from Earth and is modeled by humanity, hence it is called the \"Northern Dipper’s original destiny.\" When humans receive life, they differentiate from the One Qi. Born from Qi, they emerge from the Mysterious One. Having differentiated from Qi to be born, they should clarify their root and origin, and guard the Mysterious One to extend their life.\n\n---\n\n**At that time**\n\"At that time\" refers to the moment when the sutra was first spoken.\n\n**The Supreme Lord Lao**\nWhen Heaven and Earth first divided, the One Qi generated the Primordial Originator, the Two Qi generated the Primordial Sovereign, and the Three Qi generated Lord Lao. Lord Lao dwells below as the master of transformation. In Heaven, he is the lord of the myriad heavens; descending to the world, he is the teacher of the hundred kings. Among the stars, he is the Celestial August Emperor; in the teachings, he is the Supreme Lord Lao.\n\nAs for the \"Great Sage Lord Lao in the Grand Clarity Palace,\" this is incorrect.\n\n**In the first year of Yongshou, the seventh day of the first month**\n\"Yongshou\" was the reign era of Emperor Huan of the Han, corresponding to the year *yiwei* (155 CE), the seventh day of the first month.\n\n**In the Grand Ultimate Palace of the Supreme Clarity Realm**\nThe \"Supreme Clarity Realm\" is the domain where Lord Lao resides, and its palace is named the \"Three Sovereigns’ Grotto-Spirit Supreme Clarity Grand Ultimate Palace.\"\n\nThe *Scripture of Opening Heaven* states: At the summit of the Round Canopy lies the Heaven of Great Veil Beyond, the realm of the Three Clarities. The Sacred Realm of Jade Clarity encompasses twelve sacred heavens; below Jade Clarity lies the Perfected Realm of Supreme Clarity with twelve perfected heavens; below Supreme Clarity lies the Immortal Realm of Grand Clarity with twelve immortal heavens; beneath Grand Clarity are the four heavens of the four kinds of beings; below these are the four heavens of the Formless Realm; beneath the Formless Realm are the eighteen heavens of the Form Realm; below the Form Realm are the six heavens of the Desire Realm; beneath the Desire Realm, the void connects to the central axis, and below lies the human realm. The Three Clarities, three realms, and thirty-six heavens give rise to the myriad beings of the Three Realms, their forms flowing in all directions. Below, each generates fifty-five thousand five hundred fifty-five billion worlds without limit. In all eight directions of this earth and heaven, each is a great chiliocosm of three thousand worlds, all receiving the Three Clarities and Three Origins.\n\nThe thirty-six heavens above and below correspond to the thirty-six terrestrial divisions of the nine provinces in each of the four directions, aligning with the thirty-six celestial gates of the heavenly mechanism. Thus, the Three Powers share qi, heaven and humanity respond to one another, and all receive life from the Dao.\n\nThe realm of Grand Clarity lies below Jade Clarity and Supreme Clarity yet above the myriad heavens of the Three Realms. One version mistakenly places it within the Grand Clarity Palace.\n\nBeholding sentient beings, the Supreme Lord ever abides in his palace, gazing in the four directions upon the world below, compassionately pitying all beings. For kalpas uncounted, they drift and sink, revolving through birth and death. Human lives, failing to awaken, drift in bitter destinies, trapped in the wheel of birth and death, enduring kalpas without end. Some dwell in the human realm, born in the Central Lands; others are born among the Yi and Di barbarians or within the lands of the Man and Rong tribes. The human realm is one of the six destinies; within the Central Lands, the four barbarians, and the eight wastes, all beings with the three karmas and five encumbrances belong to the human realm. One version mistakenly writes \"barbarian domains.\"\n\nSome are rich, some noble, some lowly, some poor—all temporarily bound by karmic conditions, even falling into hell. Whether they do good or evil, create blessings or transgressions, human hearts differ, and karmic retributions vary. The netherworld records all without error. Yet because there is no constancy—constancy being the root of nature and appearance, the gateway to transcendence—people of the most ancient times required no cultivation, for their minds were ever constant. This was because their purity remained undivided and their great simplicity unscattered. In later ages, human hearts grew shallow and crafty, scheming and opportunism arose, purity and simplicity dissolved, and the roots of transgression grew. With no place for the mind to arise, they became ever more distant from the Dao.\n\nThus, Lord Lao crossed westward to Kashmir, established the Gate of Prajñā, expounded the mind’s dharma, and broadly discoursed on the scriptural teachings to guide all toward awakening. Yet how can people of the degenerate age, their eyes coveting splendid colors, their mouths craving rare flavors, their noses delighting in orchids and musk, their bodies desiring softness and lightness, their minds unable to cease—how can they not obscure their own nature’s root? They merely recite with their mouths but cannot uphold it in their hearts.\n\nIn ancient times, people savored their food, wore their clothes, and delighted in their customs, neither envying the high nor despising the low. Even unto old age and death, they did not visit one another, each without attachment to others. Without cultivation, the Dao naturally manifested. Now, those who practice meditation all say one must not cling to images or forms, for even the slightest attachment is an error. This is true, yet they know not where to begin.\n\nAmong the Daoist scriptures, the *Scripture of Inner Observation*, the *Scripture of Concentration and Observation*, the *Scripture of Purity*, the *Scripture of Disaster Dispelling*, and the *Treatise on Sitting in Forgetfulness*—these texts speak most clearly, yet people still grope uncertainly. How much less can they grasp other scattered teachings? Only this *True Scripture of the Northern Dipper for Prolonging Life* serves as the root of nature and appearance, the convenient gateway to great concentration. If one can rely on this scripture and uphold its practices, the source of concentration becomes evident. When one reaches the state of no thought, no entanglement, and no attachment, one knows the inconceivable merit of this scripture.\n\nWhen karmic transgressions entangle the soul, binding it to the netherworld, and suffering is complete, one departs from the human realm, reborn among beasts or as birds and insects, turning away from the human path and making it difficult to regain a human body. Sinking thus, unaware and unenlightened, one suffers this cycle of rebirth due to past lives’ delusion of the true nature.\n\nKarmic transgressions arise from the ten evils, all originating from the three karmas: bodily karma includes three—killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct; verbal karma includes four—false speech, frivolous speech, divisive speech, and harsh speech; mental karma includes three—greed, hatred, and delusion. \"Entanglement\" means being tied and bound, for people fail to discern the root of nature and appearance or awaken to the gateway of transcendence. Adrift on the river of desire, blown by the winds of the sea of craving, they are entangled and bound by karmic transgressions, unable to attain liberation. Thus, the netherworld detains them, and their yang souls endure myriad sufferings until their time is fulfilled. Then, barred from the human realm, they fall into the destinies of beasts, birds, and insects, turning ever more perverse, unable to return to the human path or regain a human body. Sinking thus, unaware and unenlightened, they suffer this cycle of karmic retribution due to past lives’ delusion of their true nature.\n\nWith a heart of compassion, the Lord manifests transformations to teach and convert. Lord Lao, pitying sentient beings, manifests transformations and descends to expound the scriptural teachings and awaken the deluded.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Great Mystery* states: The Nine Heavenly Thearchs each array their immortal retinues, welcoming Lord Lao in the various Grand Clarity Palaces and inviting him to each of the nine heavens to lecture on the ninefold Way of the Central Yellow. Solemnly enthroned in the Palace of the Grand Ultimate, his countless transformation bodies teach in all directions, responding to conditions and assuming titles to universally save heaven and humanity. Thus, he descends daily, serving as the imperial teacher of successive dynasties.\n\nAs for Shu’s capital, the earth spirits surged forth...\n\nIn the Western Shu region, its territory lies within Chengdu Prefecture. The *Scripture of the Opening of Heaven* states: Beneath the World of the Limitless, there exists another realm, where the Nine Ramparts and Thirty-Six Earth Sovereigns are arrayed. Below the Nine Ramparts, the qi of the Windy Marsh resembles wind yet is not wind, resembles water yet is not water—its nature is dim and suffering, indistinguishable. It upholds the earthly wheel, preventing it from tilting. Above the Windy Marsh, within the Nine Ramparts, the earth spirits reside. Heaven is exalted, earth is humble; when the Most High descends, the earth spirits emerge to support his feet—such is the proper ritual. They raised a jade platform to serve as a high seat.\n\nThereupon, Lord Lao ascended the jade platform and bestowed upon the Heavenly Master the *True Essentials of the Northern Dipper’s Original Destiny*. The Heavenly Master’s surname was Zhang, a native of Pei’s Fengyi County, the eighth-generation descendant of Zhang Liang, the Marquis of Liu. During the Han dynasty, his original name was Ling; after entering the Dao, he added the character *Dao* to his name. Daoist scriptures all record: \"Daoling, styled Hanfu.\" Now, to avoid the taboo of Daoling’s name, he is referred to by his style, \"True Man.\" The Heavenly Master traveled with Lord Lao to Chengdu, arriving at the site where the Jade Maiden of Great Fuxi refined the Great Elixir. There, the earth spirits raised a jade platform, over a *zhang* in height. Lord Lao ascended the platform, while the Heavenly Master bowed at its base. At that moment, Lord Lao expounded the method of the Northern Dipper for prolonging life and eradicating death, transmitting it to the Heavenly Master. The site lies over one *li* to the left of Chengdu Prefecture’s southern gate. Today, the Jade Platform Abbey remains, along with the four stone legs of the platform. The Heavenly Master established his governance there, making it the twenty-third of his administrative seats.\n\nThis is the scripture; the *jue* are the methods. There are also the *Mysterious Numinous Scripture’s Essentials*, which employ methods to enact the scripture’s affairs. Broadly propagating these essential methods universally saves sentient beings. The Most High, in his vast compassion, reveals the secret and essential scriptural methods to universally deliver and cross over all beings, regardless of wisdom or foolishness, enabling them to comprehend, awaken, and cultivate, thereby beholding the true and authentic Dao.\n\nAt that time, Lord Lao addressed the Heavenly Master, saying: \"The human body is difficult to obtain. The *Scripture of the Chapters on Generating the Spirit* states: When a person receives life within the womb, the Three Primes nurture and cultivate it. The primordial qi binds the form, and after nine months, the spirits are arrayed. When the qi is full, the voice emerges, and though the voice is yet nascent, the spirits are complete. The Nine Heavens rejoice, the Great Unity holds the tally, the Thearchs confer ranks, the Directors of Destinies record the register, the Controllers of Life determine the allotment, the Five Thearchs oversee birth, and the Holy Mother guards the chamber. Heavenly spirits, earthly deities, and the Three Realms all stand guard. The Nine Celestial Marshals stand in the courtyard, facing east, reciting the *Nine Heavens’ Precious Chapters on Generating the Spirit* nine times. If the child is male, the myriad spirits chant 'reverence'; if female, they chant 'submission.' If male, the Controller of Life respectfully assents; if female, it respectfully complies. Only then is the child born. If the Nine Great Marshals do not issue the life tally, and the myriad spirits do not chant 'reverence' or 'assent,' birth does not occur.\n\nWhen a person is reborn into the human realm, their form is bathed in the Great Yang, startling heaven and earth. Such nobility is scarcely surpassable. Heavenly perfected ones, earthly spirits, and the Three Realms all attend—this is not a trifling matter. At the moment of birth, it is not to be deemed base. Thus, the human body is truly difficult to obtain. The ancient worthies offered a metaphor: Scatter mustard seeds atop Mount Kunlun, then hold a needle below to catch them—only those that meet the needle obtain a human body. Those that fall are innumerable. Such is the difficulty of obtaining it.\n\nThe Middle Land is hard to be born into. The Middle Land is the blessed land of the Central Kingdom, the most noble realm among humans and heavens. Yet with shallow karmic blessings, it is difficult to be born here. Even if one is born here, the true Dharma is hard to encounter. Many are deluded regarding the authentic Dao and enter heterodox sects. As the Perfected Lord Yin stated: 'A righteous person expounding heterodox teachings—those heterodox teachings all return to rectitude. A heterodox person expounding the true Dharma—the true Dharma also returns to heterodoxy.' There is no heterodoxy or orthodoxy in the Dharma; the Dao is not dual. Yet people harbor heterodox minds, giving rise to confusion and chaos, unable to discern for themselves. Thus, the true Dharma is hard to encounter.\n\nMany plant the roots of transgression, indulge in cunning deceit, give free rein to lust and killing, delight in worldly passions, yield to greed and wrath, sink into hell, and lose their human form. The six senses cannot be purified, and all transgressions arise therefrom. Cunning deceit includes embellished speech, double-tongued words, and falsehoods—people often act wantonly without restraint. Lust and killing involve lewdness and taking life—people often indulge without moderation or precepts. Worldly passions are manifold—people delight in them without restraint. Greed, love, and wrath—people often indulge without control. After the body perishes, they sink into hell, enduring myriad sufferings, and cannot regain a human form. For such reasons, sentient beings fail to awaken and do not know the true Dao, and those who are deluded are many.\n\nGiven these circumstances, sentient beings cannot awaken to the true Dao, and thus the deluded are exceedingly numerous. Now, I pity and behold these sentient beings, and therefore bestow the teachings and expound good causes, enabling them to know the Dao, understand that body, nature, and life all depend on the Dao for their existence, and comprehend these conditions. Thus, they may abide long in the human realm, their lineage unbroken, and be human life after life.\"\n\nLord Lao, pitying sentient beings, expounded the scriptural *jue* and good causes to enable their awakening to the Dao. The *Scripture of Inner Observation* states: \"From the moment one receives form, it is called *nature*; from the Dao one receives life, it is called *destiny*. Human nature and life both arise from the Dao. Those who know the Dao and practice it are like sowing seeds in spring—autumn will bring a harvest, and spring will return. Sowing again in spring, life is obtained anew. All life arises from this Dao.\"\n\nDo not be born in a land without the Dao. A ruler with the Dao cherishes the people as his own children; a ruler without the Dao regards the people as grass or mustard seeds. Such were the rulers Jie of Xia, Zhou of Shang, the First Emperor of Qin, and Yang of Sui, as well as the eras of Jin and Wei, when chaos followed chaos. To be born a person in such times—how could it be considered fortunate? To be born in a land with the Dao—is this not the greatest good?\"\n\n\"Do not sever humanity’s root. Once this Dao is awakened, one will be human life after life, the root unbroken. Further cultivating the heart in the true Dao, one gradually enters the immortal lineage, forever escaping the cycle of rebirth and ascending to attain the Dao. The Dao resides in the heart—guard it without loss, and gradual attainment will follow. Human cultivation and learning proceed by degrees, hence the *Gradual Hexagram*. As Laozi said: ‘A tree of arm-spanning girth begins as a tiny sprout; a journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.’ The only danger is knowing the Dao yet failing to practice it—those who practice will surely reach it. By cultivating the true Dao step by step, one may escape the cycle of rebirth and attain the Dao.\n\nThus, I reveal to you this wondrous method to deliver the people of heaven and guide them to return to truth and know their destiny. Lord Lao bestowed upon the Heavenly Master the most profound scriptural instructions, awakening those of lesser understanding to return to the true Dao and comprehend their original destiny. On the day of one’s *benming* (original destiny), one should perform purification rites and set up an offering altar, invoking the Northern Dipper. The *benming* is called the *Small Gathering Assembly*, when the spirits within the body all assemble in the *Original Palace* to assess merits and transgressions. Every cycle of sixty days, as the scriptures say: ‘Six times each year, the descent occurs among humankind.’ On such days, it is fitting to perform purification rites and offerings, invoking the Dipper Stars to repent sins, dispel calamities, prolong life, and pray for blessings.\n\nThe Three Officials:\nThe Heavenly Official of the Upper Prime bestows blessings,\nThe Earthly Official of the Middle Prime pardons sins,\nThe Water Official of the Lower Prime resolves misfortunes.\n\nThe Seven Primes are governed by the Three Primes, which are also the convergence of the Three Destinies.\n\nThe Five Emperors:\nThe Azure Emperor governs Wood,\nThe Vermilion Emperor governs Fire,\nThe White Emperor governs Metal,\nThe Black Emperor governs Water,\nThe Yellow Emperor governs Earth.\nHumans receive form through the Five Phases, and the Five Emperors are involved in all things.\n\nThe Nine Bureaus:\nThe Upper Prime has Three Officials and Nine Bureaus,\nThe Middle Prime has Three Officials and Nine Bureaus,\nThe Lower Prime has Three Officials and Nine Bureaus,\nTogether forming Nine Officials and Twenty-Seven Bureaus.\nThe Upper Prime has thirty-six departments,\nThe Middle and Lower Primes each have forty-two departments,\nTotaling one hundred and twenty departments.\nThey govern all beings—celestial and terrestrial, spirits, immortals, ghosts, and the myriad creatures—all are overseen by the Dipper Officials, connecting inner and outer duties without the slightest error.\n\nThe Four Offices:\nThe Heavenly Offices are the Offices of Destiny, Records, Wrongs, and Perils.\nThe Earthly Offices are the Offices of Destiny, Records, Merit, and Shared Retribution.\n\nTo pray for blessings and dispel calamities, one presents petitions with sincere wishes. All entreaties should be expressed in written petitions, fully conveying one’s intent. Matters should be truthfully reported, and the language need not be ornate—this can eliminate misfortunes and invoke blessings. Offerings should be made with utmost reverence: various incense and flowers, seasonal fresh fruits (the first fruits of the season are called *offerings of the new*), and the five fruits—peach, plum, jujube, chestnut, and apricot—should be presented with sincerity.\n\nAdapt to the rituals of the world:\nThe rituals of the world include advancing and retreating, bowing and rising, approaching the altar, praising and worshiping, celebratory rites, offering flowers, pouring water, serving jujube soup and fine tea. These are the world’s rituals, varying by rank. The highest are for kings, dukes, and great officials; next for the wealthy and elders; then for the middle class; and last for the poor. Each should measure their means and present offerings with sincerity. Even in worldly gatherings among relatives and friends, each adapts to the appropriate rituals. At such times, the noble and wealthy display lavish spreads, while the middle class prepares modest offerings. If even human affairs are treated with such care, how can one be careless when invoking the celestial perfected?\n\nGold and silver paper money and paper horses are also part of worldly rituals. The Heavenly Master said: ‘In the most ancient times, there was no money; in the middle era, it began to be used. Burning paper money and paper horses follows worldly custom.’ When heaven and earth first separated, there were already celestial money stars governing such matters. As times change, the stars respond to the occasion, aligning with the Dao and harmonizing yin and yang. If one uses the ancient *Hetu* method to perform Dipper rites, the rituals differ from worldly practices.\n\nEstablish a pure altar, modeling heaven and earth:\nA pure dwelling should be round like heaven and square like earth—this is the design of the altar, round within and square without. Whether in a temple or at home, one should act according to their capacity to perform rituals. Even those without means should maintain a sincere heart; those with means who are stingy do not truly act according to their capacity. The merit and virtue are profound and cannot be fully described.\"\n\nReciting the sacred names of the Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolves transgressions, washes away calamities and misfortunes, augments life with fortune and longevity, and brings virtuous rewards to the self. In times of urgent distress, one may burn incense and recite scriptures to secure timely peace and safety. With wholehearted devotion, invoking the sacred titles of the Northern Dipper dissolves transgressions as they arise, cleanses calamities and misfortunes, strengthens life with fortune and longevity, and bestows virtuous rewards upon the self. In moments of dire peril, burning incense and reciting the names brings swift response and immediate tranquility.\n\nThus is proclaimed the efficacy of the Great Sage Northern Dipper in resolving adversities:\n\nThose who uphold these scriptural precepts may dissolve all hardships, as attested by such verifications, and should perform rites of expiation accordingly.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Three Calamities.\nThe Three Calamities are stellar in nature, and when they coincide with one’s year of fate, they constitute the gravest of disasters. In the Dipper-appeal method, some place the Three Calamity Stars before the Dipper’s mouth for veneration, for these stars preside over the foremost of all adversities. For example:\n- Those born in the years of *yin*, *wu*, or *xu* encounter these stars in the years of *shen*, *you*, or *xu*, where the Human Star, Heavenly Misfortune Star, and Earthly Calamity Star form the Three Calamities.\n- Those born in the years of *shen*, *zi*, or *chen* encounter them in the years of *yin*, *mao*, or *chen*, where the Heavenly Worm Star, Heavenly Punishment Star, and Heavenly Comet Star form the Three Calamities.\n- Those born in the years of *si*, *you*, or *chou* encounter them in the years of *hai*, *zi*, or *chou*, where the Earthly Ruin Star, Earthly Perishing Star, and Earthly Punishment Star form the Three Calamities.\n- Those born in the years of *hai*, *mao*, or *wei* encounter them in the years of *si*, *wu*, or *wei*, where the Black Evil Star, Yin Conspiracy Star, and White Slayer Star form the Three Calamities.\nWhen these stars align with one’s fate, bringing adversity within three years, one should preemptively dissolve them to secure blessings.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Four Slayer Calamities.\nThe Year Slayer, Month Slayer, Day Slayer, and Hour Slayer constitute the Four Slayers. When they coincide with the years and months of *yin-shen*, *si-hai*, *chen-xu*, *chou-wei*, *zi-wu*, or *mao-you*, and fully clash with one’s Four Pillars, they are called the Four Slayers. If afflicted, the calamity is severe, and one should preemptively perform rites of expiation.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Five Phase Calamities.\nMetal restrains Wood, Wood restrains Earth, Earth restrains Water, Water restrains Fire, and Fire restrains Metal. When the Five Phases in a person’s fate are discordant and mutually restraining, calamities arise, and one should preemptively dissolve them.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Six Harm Calamities.\n*Zi* harms *wei*, *wei* harms *zi*; *chou* harms *wu*, *wu* harms *chou*; *yin* harms *si*, *si* harms *yin*; *chen* harms *mao*, *mao* harms *chen*; *shen* harms *hai*, *hai* harms *shen*; *you* harms *xu*, *xu* harms *you*—when these pairs meet in mutual opposition, they form the Six Harms. The *Book of Fate* states: \"When the Six Harms converge, sorrow abounds and joy is scarce,\" and one should perform rites of expiation.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Seven Injury Calamities.\nThe Robber Slayer, Calamity Slayer, Heavenly Slayer, Earthly Slayer, Year Slayer, Month Slayer, and Perishing Spirit constitute the Seven Injuries, corresponding to the essences of the Seven Stars. If one encounters them, how could there be no disaster? One should swiftly appeal for dissolution.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Eight Difficulties.\nA person’s fate is divided into Three Origins: the Heavenly Origin by the heavenly stem, the Earthly Origin by the earthly branch, and the Human Origin by the tonal phase, which together align with the Five Positions. When these Eight Matters proceed harmoniously, they bring fortune; when they reverse, they bring misfortune. If they coincide with one’s year, month, or fate, calamity is certain, and when circumstances press urgently, one should perform rites of expiation to dissolve them.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Nine Star Calamities.\nThe Nine Stars are: (1) Rāhu, (2) Earthly Mansion, (3) Water Star, (4) Metal Star, (5) Great Sun, (6) Fire Star, (7) Ketu, (8) Great Yin, and (9) Wood Star. Their configurations are also governed by the Dipper Palace. When they align with one’s year of fate, their auspiciousness or inauspiciousness is determined by the strength of their palace positions. If they portend misfortune, one should appeal to the Dipper Palace for expiation.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Marital Calamities.\nThe union of husband and wife follows the Dao of yin and yang, and should be assessed and harmonized before consummation—this is the method of the ancient sages. Yet vulgar customs sometimes propagate the notion of \"heavenly marriage,\" disregarding such assessments, leading to disharmony between yin and yang and manifold misfortunes. For instance, the Lonely Hour, Widowed Mansion, Yin Slayer, Yang Slayer, Front Five, Rear Five, Slayer of Yang, Slayer of Yin, Slayer of Husband, Slayer of Wife, Cut-off Chamber, and Lonely Phoenix all have clear precedents. If severely afflicted, one may take three or nine wives, or three or five husbands, and many remain lifelong in empty chambers. Even when such encounters occur, rites of expiation may be performed.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Calamities of Sons and Daughters.\nThe causes of such calamities are manifold, arising from the fates of husband and wife, the misfortune summoned by ancestral graves, or the depletion of hidden virtue, leading to barrenness. If the calamity stems from fate or graves, it may be dissolved through expiation. If it arises from lost hidden virtue, one should swiftly atone to the Dipper Palace, perform meritorious deeds, and cultivate virtue to plant the seed of descendants—without this, it cannot be resolved.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Calamities of Childbirth.\nIf a woman’s fate is afflicted by the Three Punishments, Metal Slayer, or the spirits of flowing blood and blood corpses, these may be dissolved. If she harbors jealousy or grievances, she should swiftly appeal to the Dipper Palace, daily renew her virtue, and avert calamity.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Calamities of Recurring Afflictions.\nThe disease of transmitted corpses, also called corpse infestation, flows unceasingly and may extinguish a household. It is also termed tomb litigation or summons of retribution. One should swiftly cultivate goodness and dissolve it according to the method.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Calamities of Epidemics.\nThe *qi* of pestilential jaundice and seasonal epidemics arises when one fails to nurture the spiritual root, indulges in pungent and taboo foods, acts without righteousness or benevolence, disrupts the harmony of the six relations, neglects incense offerings, and loses the protection of deities and spirits. This causes households to suffer epidemics, bodies to contract toxic *qi*, illnesses to afflict young and old, and deaths among the populace. If the transgression is grave, the lineage may be cut off. Such calamities, called \"heavenly movements,\" issue from the Heavenly Court. When one or two are infected, one should urgently perform rites of expiation to dissolve them.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Calamities of Illness.\nThe method holds that chronic and acute ailments alike may be dispelled.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Calamities of Essence-Wasting Demons.\nThe *Classic* states: Malevolent spirits and demonic harms are dispelled through ritual dissolution.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Calamities of Tigers and Wolves.\nThe *Art* teaches: For those born in the *zi* hour encountering the *mao* hour, or those born in the *chou* hour encountering the *chen* hour, proceed in sequence to determine the fate—those whose destiny is afflicted must not enter mountain forests, lest they incur the misfortune of tigers and wolves. Moreover, for those born in the *zi* hour encountering the *shen* hour, or those born in the *chou* hour encountering the *you* hour, proceed likewise in sequence—this is called the Tiger-Wolf Killing. As for the Seven Destructive Stars and Metal Destructive Stars, these too bring bodily harm, and thus must be dissolved. Should one wish to enter the mountains, one must first perform the ritual to exorcise them. From this calamity to the Calamity of the Earthly Net, together they are called the Eight Difficult Calamities.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Calamities of Venomous Insects and Snakes.\nThe *Baopuzi* states: The *qi* of the Central Plains is pure and harmonious, devoid of poisonous creatures; the *qi* of the southern lands is unbalanced, fierce and swift, giving rise to many venomous creatures. When traveling through mountain forests, one must take precautions to dissolve these dangers.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Calamities of Bandits and Robbers.\nWhen journeying by water or land, one should perform rites of expiation in advance to guard against unforeseen perils.\n\nWhen encountering bandits and robbers who seize one’s possessions, this is the karmic retribution for having stolen the king’s property in past or present lives. At such times, one’s very life may be imperiled—one must swiftly appeal to the Northern Dipper, invoking its sacred names, and the peril shall be dispelled in that very moment.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Calamity of Cangues and Cudgels.\nThe *Celestial Statutes* state: Those long confined in prison suffer the calamity of cangues and cudgels; if one’s grievances remain unredressed due to wrongful oppression, one may petition the city god of one’s jurisdiction, entrusting the investigation to officials. Let their minds be enlightened, swiftly resolving the matter. When ritual masters perform this rite, its efficacy is manifest—how much more so when one supplicates the Lords of the Dipper.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Calamity of Unnatural Death.\nThis category encompasses a thousand instances, impossible to enumerate in full; all deaths that do not come naturally are called unnatural. If one suspects such a fate, one must perform rites of expiation in advance, and the response shall surely be felt. Yet if one willfully violates the laws of yin and yang, can such a calamity be dissolved?\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Calamity of Curses and Oaths.\nThis calamity, too, has many forms. The *Celestial Statutes* decree: Ghosts and spirits not of official rank may not accept human curses. For those who are not enlightened great spirits lack the wisdom to discern truth from falsehood; they merely believe slanderous curses, wrongly seize souls, and cause people to become deranged, mute, or bedridden for long periods—all of which may be dissolved through supplication.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Calamity of the Celestial Net.\nThe hours of *xu* and *hai* (19:00–23:00) are the two limits of the Celestial Net in a person’s fate and *qi*. When one encounters this, one may suffer the calamity of celestial imprisonment—it is fitting to dissolve it in advance.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Calamity of the Earthly Net.\nThe hours of *chen* and *si* (7:00–11:00) are the two limits of the Earthly Net in a person’s fate and *qi*. When one encounters this, one may suffer the calamity of imprisonment in prefectural or county jails—it is fitting to perform rites of expiation in advance. Moreover, when the Year Star aligns with the Three Lives and Four Pillars of one’s destiny, this is called \"obscured *qi*,\" which also brings the calamity of nets and snares.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Calamity of Blade and Warfare.\nThe calamity of blade and warfare is determined by fate. Yet if one devoutly reveres the true Lords of the Dipper, one shall naturally pass through these tribulations.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Calamity of Water and Fire.\nWhen floods overflow and conflagrations rage, their cruelty is extreme. Yet under the protection of the true Lords of the Dipper, one shall be spared from fate’s reckoning in such disasters.\n\nThus, the Seven Primordial Lords, the Great Sages, are profoundly efficacious in spirit, delivering beings from all calamities and hardships, lifting suffering multitudes from their torments. If one makes urgent supplication, reciting the protective incantations, one shall attain peace and safety, generating a hundred blessings that harmonize with the Five Phases.\n\nThe Five Phases refer to the human body: the lungs correspond to Metal, the liver to Wood, the kidneys to Water, the heart to Fire, and the spleen to Earth. The Lords of the Northern Dipper, attuned to this mysterious power, deliver beings from all calamities and hardships, lifting suffering multitudes from their torments. If one makes urgent supplication and recites the incantations, generating a hundred blessings in accord with the Five Phases, then the five viscera shall be at peace.\n\nThe Three Hun-Souls shall be secure and robust,\nThe Great Mystery nurtures the hun-souls and generates *qi*, fostering inner well-being.\n\nMalignant spirits cannot linger,\nThe Seven Pois return to their true nature,\nThe Three Corpses vanish without trace,\nWater guards the mysterious power,\nAnd evil cannot assail the upright.\n\nTrue *qi* descends from the Five Directions,\nMyriad blessings naturally converge.\nThe *Central Yellow Scripture* states:\nThe liver governs the East, its color azure;\nThe lungs govern the West, their color white;\nThe heart governs the South, its color crimson;\nThe spleen governs the Center, its color yellow;\nThe kidneys govern the North, their color black.\n\nNow the five spirits merge as one,\nThe five viscera attain peace,\nThe embryonic breath roots the life-force,\nTrue *qi* descends of itself.\nThe Five *Qi* shall ascend to the Origin,\nThe mysterious power shall transform,\nAnd myriad blessings shall converge as one.\n\nThe *Central Yellow Scripture* further says:\nWhere do feathered robes and radiant clouds arise?\nAll from the five viscera’s numinous wings.\nThis is the meaning.\n\nTo attain long life and transcend the Eight Difficulties,\nAll depends on revering the Seven Stars.\nThe Eight Difficulties are:\nThe Upper Corpse is called the Heavenly Servitude,\nThe Middle Corpse the Earthly Servitude,\nThe Lower Corpse the Watery Servitude—\nThese Three Servitudes are the bondage of the Three Realms.\nFurther, the burden of sensual desire is the Gate of Suffering Heart,\nThe burden of attachment the Gate of Suffering Spirit,\nThe burden of greed the Gate of Suffering Form,\nThe burden of vanity the Gate of Suffering Essence,\nThe burden of the body the Gate of Suffering Soul—\nThese Three Corpses and Five Burdens together are called the Eight Difficulties.\nThose who die laden with karma\nAre bound to the Five Sufferings\nAnd conscripted into the Three Servitudes.\nYet if one reveres the Dipper Stars\nAnd fulfills the Way’s precepts,\nOne transcends the Eight Difficulties\nAnd ascends to the Nine Heavens.\n\nThe Nine Heavens are not the Nine Heavens of the Three Clarities,\nBut the Nine Heavens within the Dipper,\nAttained by practicing the mysterious power of the Dipper’s scriptures and formulas:\nGreedy Wolf dwells in the Numinous Flower Heaven,\nGiant Gate in the Divine Flower Palace,\nStore of Emolument in the Dark-Yellow Heaven,\nLiterary Brilliance in the Flowering-Yellow Heaven,\nIntegrity and Chastity in the Primordial August Heaven,\nMilitary Brilliance in the Central Yellow Heaven,\nBreaker of Armies in the True August Heaven,\nAssisting Star in the Supreme Constant Heaven,\nComplementary Star in the Transforming Numinous Heaven.\n\nLife after life, the body remains at ease,\nExistence after existence, the spirit stays pure.\nThe reason the human body attains such freedom\nIs the absence of all constraint.\n\nWhat binds and constrains is attachment born of greed. Shed attachment, forget greed, and life after life the body attains freedom. The reason the human spirit remains pure is the absence of defilement. Defilement arises from distraction and disorder; settle and still it, and existence after existence the spirit stays clear. When the body is free and the spirit clear, the Dao is naturally attained.\n\nGoodness resembles a reflection in light, response echoes a sound in a valley. As a mirror reflects form, beauty and ugliness distinguish themselves; as sound answers echo, good and evil leave no discrepancy. In terms of the Dao, an empty heart is like a valley, a luminous heart like a mirror. When the heart is empty, the Dao descends; when the Dao descends, the heart opens; when the heart opens, clarity dawns.\n\nThough there is seeing, one must not grasp what is seen; though there is hearing, one must not cling to what is heard. This is what is meant by \"looking yet not seeing, listening yet not hearing.\" Withdraw vision and return hearing to perfect stillness, and realize the Dao of emptiness. Though one speaks of realizing the Dao, in truth there is nothing to realize. Guard emptiness to its utmost, and the Perfected One descends; the sagely Dao is attained.\n\nThe Three Origins’ spirits guard together, the eyes of the ten thousand sages shine as one. Without calamity or obstacle, the heart of the Dao remains forever at peace. The thousand sages and ten thousand perfected of the Three Realms and ten directions observe and protect as one. Those who receive the scripture suffer no misfortune, no demonic hindrance; the heart of the Dao long preserves its tranquility and steadfastness.\n\n*Commentary on the Supreme Mysterious Numinous Northern Dipper Original Destiny Life-Prolonging Scripture, First Scroll, concludes.*\n\n1. \"Jade Bureau Seat\" (*Yuju zuo*) in the present text appears as \"Jade Bureau Seat\" (*Yuju zuo*) in the *Commentary on the Supreme Mysterious Numinous Northern Dipper Original Destiny Life-Prolonging Scripture*, which is correct.\n2. The preceding passage, \"The Great Sage Lords of the Seven Origins of the Northern Dipper can resolve the calamities of blades and weapons... can resolve the calamities of water and fire,\" is identical to the *Exegesis on the Supreme Mysterious Numinous Northern Dipper Original Destiny Life-Prolonging Scripture*, while the *Commentary on the Supreme Mysterious Numinous Northern Dipper Original Destiny Life-Prolonging Scripture* reads, \"The Great Sage Lords of the Seven Origins of the Northern Dipper can resolve the calamities of hell... can resolve all calamities.\"\n3. This line is identical to the *Exegesis on the Supreme Mysterious Numinous Northern Dipper Original Destiny Life-Prolonging Scripture*, while the *Commentary on the Supreme Mysterious Numinous Northern Dipper Original Destiny Life-Prolonging Scripture* reads, \"Demonic influences forever cease.\"\n\n*Commentary on the Supreme Mysterious Numinous Northern Dipper Original Destiny Life-Prolonging Scripture, Middle Scroll*\nAnnotated by Fu Dongzhen.\n\nThe Lord Lao says: The Northern Apex suspends its celestial image, and all stars pay homage to it. The Northern Apex is the Northern Thearch; the Emperor Star within the Dipper serves as the stellar sovereign, presiding in solemn dignity over the celestial patterns. As the *Analects* states: \"Like the Northern Apex, it abides in its place, and all stars pay homage to it.\" One variant reads \"the Northern Apex above,\" which is incorrect.\n\nIt is the pivot of creation and transformation. The Dipper’s handle and pole occupy the Thearch’s abode, governing the revolutions of the four seasons and overseeing the transformations of generation and completion. In the first, second, and third months, the Dipper’s handle points to the positions of *yin*, *mao*, and *chen*, generating and transforming the myriad things. In the fourth, fifth, and sixth months, it points to *si*, *wu*, and *wei*, nurturing and fostering the myriad things. In the seventh, eighth, and ninth months, it points to *shen*, *you*, and *xu*, ripening and maturing the myriad things. In the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth months, it points to *hai*, *zi*, and *chou*, gathering and storing the myriad things. If the Dipper’s handle does not revolve, the four seasons lose their rhythm, the Five Phases fail to respond, cold and heat deviate from their measures, yin and yang fall out of harmony, and the myriad things cannot reach completion. Thus, it is the pivot of creation and transformation.\n\nIt serves as the sovereign of human spirits, proclaiming its majesty across the Three Realms and governing the myriad numina. The Dipper is the lord of human spirits, issuing its commands and governing the myriad numina within the Three Realms. One variant reads \"proclaiming majesty through statutes and precepts,\" which is incorrect.\n\nIt determines the appointed times of good and evil for humanity. There are those in the world who devote themselves to good deeds yet suffer many calamities—this is because their merit in goodness is not yet sufficient. Once their merit is complete, great fortune will arrive. There are those who commit evil deeds yet enjoy fortune—this is because their evil is not yet full. Once their evil is complete, great misfortune will befall them. The reason good and evil each have their appointed times is that the Supreme possesses the virtue of cherishing life. For those who do good, it awaits the fullness of their great goodness; for those who do evil, it awaits their repentance. Thus, the appointed times of good and evil become clear. If one initially pursues goodness but, due to demonic obstacles, later awakens to repentance, their merit in goodness diminishes daily while their name is added to the ledger of evil. If one begins with minor evils and, seeing no misfortune, grows accustomed to them, their sins gradually increase while their name is erased from the ledger of good. Therefore, one must not fail to guard against minor evils, nor neglect minor acts of goodness. Do not fear correcting mistakes; correction must be swift. The heart of repentance should arise within the allotted time. If one exceeds the limit, death will draw near, and even after ten thousand kalpas and a thousand rebirths, though one may repent, what can be recovered?\n\nIt oversees the records of right and wrong in the Nether Bureau. To \"oversee\" is to administer; it administers the records of right and wrong in the Nether Bureau, clarifying what is right and discerning what is wrong—this is the foundation of wisdom. If even a noble person governing the people must thoroughly understand this matter, how much more so the lofty perfected and sagely philosophers? One variant reads \"to hook the Nether Bureau,\" which is incorrect.\n\nThe Five Phases share a common endowment, and the Seven Governors belong to the same category. Jupiter pertains to Wood, and the four lodges—*Jiao*, *Dou*, *Kui*, and *Jing*—share its category. Mars pertains to Fire, and the four lodges—*Wei*, *Shi*, *Zi*, and *Yi*—share its category. Venus pertains to Metal, and the four lodges—*Kang*, *Niu*, *Lou*, and *Gui*—share its category. Mercury pertains to Water, and the four lodges—*Ji*, *Bi*, *Shen*, and *Zhen*—share its category. Saturn pertains to Earth, and the four lodges—*Di*, *Nü*, *Wei*, and *Liu*—share its category. The four lodges—*Fang*, *Mao*, *Yi*, and *Xing*—are called the Solar Lodges, the abodes of the Great Yang, and are matched to Fire. The four lodges—*Xin*, *Wei*, *Bi*, and *Zhang*—are called the Lunar Lodges, the abodes of the Great Yin, and are matched to Water. These four times seven stars, together with the Five Phases and the Two Luminaries, are called the Seven Governors, all of which share the same category as the Northern Dipper. Only the Dipper’s pole governs the qi of the central heavens, revolving and regulating the celestial motions, presiding over the four directions, establishing the four seasons, harmonizing the Five Phases, and rectifying the celestial constants.\n\nIt is divided thus: *Tanlang* governs Heaven, *Jumen* governs Earth, *Lucun* governs Fire, *Wenqu* governs Water, *Kangzhen* governs Earth, *Wuqu* governs Wood, and *Pojun* governs Metal. Furthermore, *Tanlang* pertains to Water, *Jumen* and its left auxiliary pertain to Earth, *Lucun*, *Wenqu*, and *Lianzhen* pertain to Wood, *Wuqu* and *Pojun* pertain to Metal, and the *Bixing* pertains to Fire. The statutes state: \"The Nine Apexes are the origin of Brahmanic qi; the Seven Governors are the fundamental net of the primal.\" This is what it means.\n\nIt possesses the power to reverse death and inscribe life, and the ability to dispel calamities and deliver from adversity. The Dipper stars govern the prolongation of life, the deliverance from adversity, the protection of destiny, the augmentation of lifespan, the dissolution of calamities, the dispersion of misfortunes, and the support of the declining. Thus, they possess the power to reverse death and inscribe life, to dispel calamities and deliver from adversity.\n\nFrom the Son of Heaven to the common people, though their ranks differ, their allotment of destiny is without distinction. The *Illustrated Compendium of Correspondences* states: Emperor Ming of Han encountered the Seven Perfected of the Northern Dipper on Mount Zhongnan and asked, \"Do I still belong to the administration of the Upper Perfected?\" The Seven Perfected replied, \"Though you are the lord of men, your destiny is the same as that of the common people.\" The emperor then bowed again and sought long life, whereupon he obtained the *Mysterious Numinous Oral Instructions*. This illustrates the principle that though ranks differ, the allotment of destiny is without distinction.\n\nYet most people in the world remain deluded, unaware that their bodies belong to the Northern Dipper and their destinies are decreed by the Celestial Bureau. When calamities and afflictions arise, they do not know the gate of dissolution and gratitude; when seeking blessings and praying for life, they do not understand the path of refuge. People dwell within the web of the world, yet unable to preserve their authenticity and refine their qi, to nurture the Dao and cultivate perfection, they cannot avoid calamities befalling their bodies. Even those who study the Dao but possess shallow understanding cannot escape such afflictions. Thus, the *Scripture of Numinous Treasure* states: \"Even those of lesser learning may suffer illness and injury.\" If even Daoists cannot avoid this, how much more so the common people, who exhaust their bodies and minds in the pursuit of fame and profit, and deplete their essence and marrow in wine and lust? Morning and night, they gallop without rest, and when the time of adversity arrives, calamities will surely come.\n\nWhen calamities strike, not knowing the gate of dissolution and gratitude, they rely solely on shamans and invoke heterodox spirits. Yet shamans, being petty men, recklessly speak of misfortunes and demonic influences. In times of critical illness, they submit entirely to fate, slaughtering great offerings of the three sacrificial animals to pray for deliverance. If they happen to recover, they attribute it to the grace of the spirits; if they perish, they claim the ghosts have not pardoned them. They squander grain and silk, exhausting their coffers, yet still cling to heterodox masters, their hearts never satisfied. If by chance they survive, they may yet die of hunger, cold, or starvation, or be killed by bandits, thieves, or burglars, or fall into the punishments of disgrace and evil—all of this stems from such causes.\n\nAll such cases arise from ignorance of the gate of dissolution and gratitude. Those who know this gate begin with medicinal stones; if medicinal stones fail to cure, they next pray to their ancestors; if ancestors do not respond, they then seek talismanic methods; if talismanic methods prove ineffective, they will surely have offended Heaven, and calamity will be decreed by the stars. They must then perform jiao rites, acknowledging their own life-star lord, dissolving and warding off disaster, reflecting on transgressions and repenting of sins, and praying to the Dipper Palace—thus may they dispel misfortune, resolve calamity, and prolong life to increase their allotted years.\n\nIf one neither advances by crediting good physicians and medicinal stones for healing nor retreats by attending to ancestral rites, talismanic petitions, or jiao supplications, one remains ignorant of the path of refuge. Then calamity will deepen, illness will grow perilous, and death will draw near—how grievous this is!\n\nAll this is clearly stated in the *Baopuzi*; I dare not interpret it recklessly.\n\nThus, when the hun-soul is bound, Mount Fengdu’s Huoluo Northern Dipper Seven Primes Great Generals and the Ghostly Palace Northern Dipper Lord divide the offices of Heavenly Courts and Earthly Bureaus. Every seven years, the living are summoned to the Northern Dipper’s yin ministry to have their sins and blessings weighed. If within those seven years one has performed good deeds, one’s official salary and lifespan will be increased, and one’s name will be reported to the Heavenly Courts. If within those seven years one has committed evil, minor offenses will reduce one’s allotted years, while major sins will bring immediate death. If one’s sins are mingled with blessings or blessings with sins, or if sins are great but blessings meager while one’s allotted years remain unfulfilled and the reckoning undetermined, then during the summons the hun-soul will be bound to the yin ministry, the body will lie stricken with illness, and suffering will be endured. When the suffering is complete, one will be severed from the human realm, die, and enter the yin ministry, sinking into evil destinies—human form forever lost.\n\nThe method of summoning souls begins at one year of age for those born in the *zi* year; at two for *chou* and *hai*; at three for *yin* and *xu*; at four for *mao* and *you*; at five for *chen* and *shen*; at six for *si* and *wei*; and at seven for *wu*. Thus, those born in *zi* begin at one year, so at eight years their soul is summoned, again at fifteen, and again at twenty-two—each summons occurring every seven years. Those who begin at two are summoned at nine, sixteen, and twenty-three, and so on. All summoned souls proceed to the official bureau of their life-star.\n\nIn the year of summons, many suffer calamities. Only those who accumulate goodness may be exempt, though even they must face one summons after two or three exemptions, for the living hun-soul must be examined for merits and faults, and the *qi* assessed. The Three Officials, Nine Bureaus, Five Emperors, and Four Departments jointly oversee this matter, reviewing and determining it at each seasonal festival. If the reckoning remains unresolved, it must be re-examined until it is precise, without the slightest error.\n\nIn the year of summons, one should perform the Dao, recite scriptures, and dissolve the *qi* of examination. Further, one may suffer from the calamity of broken oaths, or the hun-soul may be bound to earth-altars, spirit-shrines, or by the curses of heterodox masters. Misfortune will then entangle one: chronic illness may not heal, or malevolent spirits may assail, causing years of debilitation, prolonged adversity. Misfortune is the calamity of cangues and rods; chronic illness, the calamity of disease; malevolent spirits, the calamity of demonic *qi*; debilitation and adversity, the calamity of the Six Harms.\n\nTomb disputes and spectral summons may implicate the recently deceased. Tombs refer to the graves of ancestors; spectral summons arise when the yin ministry’s investigations extend to the living; \"implicate\" means the deceased transmit corpse-*qi* to burden the living. Tomb disputes are manifold, with countless variations, bringing a thousand disasters and a hundred calamities, cutting off descendants, and thwarting all endeavors—all stemming from tomb disputes. There are eighty-one types of tomb disputes, large and small, corresponding to grand and modest graves, from which disputes arise.\n\nIn broad terms: during the lifetimes of one’s nine ancestors and seven generations, transgressions are many. After death, they face numerous investigations, and if descendants have not prospered, they must redeem these debts in the netherworld, where resentment and lamentation arise. Confined to the yin ministry with no means of resolution, the Heavenly Courts investigate and impose judgments, while yin officials extend these to the living. On the Three Primes and Five La days, they are brought forth for interrogation, their descendants’ names and tomb locations examined, sins recorded, and names fixed. Descendants are subtly summoned, leading to their ruin—no trifling matter.\n\nMoreover, improper yin-yang burial sites fall under the positions of the Northern Dipper’s Nine Stars, which determine celestial stars and earthly luminaries, the flow of mountains and waters, the depth of the burial site, the size of the Bright Hall, the height of the Four Symbols, and the orientation of the Five Tones—all governed by the Dipper Palace. If auspicious, peace ensues; if inauspicious, disputes arise. Burials at water sources, interments before spirit-temples, damaged tombs, broken coffins, overlapping graves, or new tombs encroaching on old—such cases number over a hundred, all constituting tomb disputes that harm the living. One must swiftly petition the Dipper Palace to seek dissolution.\n\nOr one may suffer Heaven’s reproach or false accusations from below. When one accumulates sins and commits transgressions without repentance, Heaven will send down punishment, and ghosts will seize the opportunity—this is what is meant by \"ghosts exploit the gaps of calamity and decline.\" (One version reads \"false accusations\" as incorrect.)\n\nHow to resolve such peril? One must urgently petition the Northern Dipper, perform jiao rites to thank the Perfected Lords, and recite the true scriptures, acknowledging one’s life-star lord—only then may one attain peace and prosperity.\n\nFor all who face such calamities, one must swiftly petition the Dipper Palace, acknowledge one’s life-star lord, reverently recite this scripture, and perform jiao rites with sincerity—thus may one attain peace and prosperity.\n\nMoreover, there are profound mysteries that cannot be fully expounded. The scripture does not exhaust the esoteric inner teachings, for their depth and subtlety defy complete articulation. Whenever one beholds the true form of the Northern Dipper, one must bow in reverence and utmost respect.\n\nThe Dao’s image is formless, manifesting through transformation—this is what is called \"the image without image, the form without form, the shape without shape.\" It cannot be sought through mere gazing, nor obtained through mere encounter. The so-called true form arises from the convergence of qi, born in accord with qi, embodying the essence of emptiness, naturally and spontaneously. Its foundation is luminous clarity, from which colors and images emerge. Thus, names are derived from forms, and designations established by images. The names that can be named arise as needed, for they are not fixed but contingent upon their use.\n\nTherefore, the true form and its names reside within my heart. Though the Dao is without mind, it may be sought through sentiment; though the Dao is without sentiment, it flickers in the indistinct. When one transcends the body and abides in it, the true form is present—this is when one should bow one’s head in reverence and cultivate a heart of utmost respect.\n\nThe first star of the Northern Dipper, Yangming, is the Great Star Lord Tanlang, governing those born in the *zi* hour. The Star Lord’s surname is Ling, personal name Yaotianchui, style Tanlang. He wears a hibiscus crown, holds a jade tablet, dons a crimson robe with a purple skirt, a nine-colored azure mantle, and phoenix-embroidered shoes. In transformation, he appears as a spirit of the wilderness—his face azure, hair red and bristling upward, left hand holding a white staff, right hand resting forward.\n\nIn his true form, he wears a Nine Mornings Jade Crown, azure feathered flying garments, and wields the Dipper. The *Central Mystery Diagram* states: The Perfected Dipper Warden is titled the Jade Sovereign Nine Mornings Lord, dwelling in the Jade Tower of the Green City within the Supreme Palace. He is also called the Great Sage of the Pivot Palace □ Star Lord, or the Supporting Perfected Lord Luoshenzi, serving in heaven.

He governs the Terrestrial Origin, acting as the Celestial Grand Steward, overseeing official ranks and emoluments. Above, he commands the celestial lodges; below, he leads the myriad spirits and those who study immortality. All offices of perfected immortals are subject to his authority.\n\nHe governs those born in the *chou* and *hai* hours, overseeing the True Lord of the Great Yin. The four lunar lodges—Stomach, Pleiades, Net, and Turtle Beak—along with the terrestrial divisions of Chu and Yizhou, fall under his domain. His nodal season is Yinjing, when autumn harvests the myriad beings.\n\nThe *Art of Disappearance* states: The celestial name Tianren is Yuquan. The star spans 550 *li*. When lit as a lamp, it is called the Life Star, its brightness or dimness serving as verification. The true talisman is called the Talisman of Crossing Calamity.\n\nThe third star of the Northern Dipper, the Perfected Zhenren, is the True Star Lord Luzun, governing those born in the *yin* and *xu* hours. The Star Lord’s surname is Guibing, personal name Chuzhongta, style Luzun. He wears a Nine-Colored Treasure Crown, a yellow robe with a blue skirt, a five-colored crimson mantle, and dragon-patterned shoes. In transformation, he appears as a handsome man of twenty, his flower-like face clad in grass garments, holding a brush, often standing face-forward.\n\nIn his true form, he wears a Flying Cloud Treasure Crown, azure feathered flying garments, and wields the Dipper. The *Central Azure Register* calls him the Dipper-Treading Perfected, titled the Jade Sovereign Jade Immortal Flourishing Morning Lord, dwelling in the Yellow Terrace Jade Tower of the True Origin Palace. He is also called the Great Sage of the Mechanism Palace □ Star Lord, or the Portent Perfected Lord Weifuzi, serving in the realm of fire. He governs the Solar Origin, acting as the Celestial Minister of Works, overseeing immortals. Above, he commands the lofty perfected of the Nine Heavens; in the middle, he oversees the numinous immortals of the Five Peaks; below, he leads those who study the Dao. All offices of perfected immortals are subject to his authority.\n\nHe governs those born in the *yin* and *xu* hours, overseeing the True Lord of the Water Star. The four lunar lodges—Well, Ghost, Willow, and Star—along with the terrestrial divisions of Liang and Jizhou, fall under his domain.\n\nThe *Art of Disappearance* states: The celestial name Tianzhu is Zisu. The star spans 720 *li*. When lit as a lamp, it is called the Fortune Star, its brightness or dimness serving as verification. The true talisman is called the Talisman of Preserving Life.\n\nThe fourth star of the Northern Dipper, Xuanming, is the Star Lord Wenqu of the Torsion, governing those born in the *mao* and *you* hours. The Star Lord’s surname is Lingshu, personal name Yaotian, style Wenqu. He wears a Six-Colored Coiling Dragon Crown, a white robe with a crimson skirt, a three-colored yellow mantle, and turtle-patterned shoes. In transformation, he appears as a woman—her face black, hair disheveled—holding written texts, riding a five-colored cloud dragon, glancing back at the Star Lord Lianzhen.\n\nIn his true form, he wears a Three-Flowered Treasure Crown, cinnabar brocade flying garments, and wields a Dark Numinous Staff. He is called the Dipper-Stepping Perfected, titled the Jade Sovereign Dark Supreme Flying Flourishing Morning Lord, dwelling in the Vermilion Tower Jade Tower of the Torsion Secluded Palace.

When illuminated, it wards off misfortunes, cures illnesses, and administers medicines; brightness bodes well, while dimness portends ill.\"\n\nThe eighth palace, the Imperial Seat Palace, is where the Empress of Transformation, the High Sovereign’s Left Consort of the Dipper’s midst, resides.

Another hidden star is called the Aligned Star, which resides beside the inner edge of the Great Gate Star.\n\nThe Upper Terrace’s Void Essence Opening Virtue Star Lord.\nThe Middle Terrace’s Sixfold Purity Controller of Emptiness Star Lord.\nThe Lower Terrace’s Crooked Life Controller of Fortune Star Lord.\n\nThe Upper Terrace Star Lord is named Void Essence, his face crimson, exhaling red *qi*, hair unbound in Daoist robes, holding a green jade tablet, riding black clouds, with yellow *qi* crowning his head.\nThe Middle Terrace Star Lord is named Sixfold Purity, also called Sixfold Pavilion, his face white, exhaling white *qi* that fills the heavens, dressed in Daoist robes, holding a white jade tablet, riding white clouds, with white *qi* crowning his head.\nThe Lower Terrace Star Lord is named Crooked Life, his face small yet radiant with a thousand beams, *qi* like threads piercing the dark, standing amid blue-green *qi*, clad in Daoist robes, holding a blue-green jade tablet.\n\nThe Three Terraces comprise six stars, shining in pairs, called the Celestial Stairway. In heaven, they are the Three Terraces; in rank, the Three Dukes; in man, the Three Hun. They array the Grand Stair to assist the Emperor’s throne.\nThe two stars of the Upper Terrace: the upper star governs emperors, the lower star governs empresses.\nThe two stars of the Middle Terrace: the upper star governs feudal lords and the Three Dukes, the lower star governs ministers and grandees.\nThe two stars of the Lower Terrace: the upper star governs scholars, the lower star governs commoners.\n\nThe Three Terraces receive the three *qi* of emptiness—luminous blue-green, yellow, and white—true colors that harmonize yin and yang. The *Southern Dipper Sutra* states: The Southern Dipper molds the *hun*; the Northern Dipper forges the *po*—this is the principle of yin and yang’s molding and forging. Yin and yang smelt and refine to generate our spirit; only after the spirit descends into the womb can life take form. The Terrace (*tai*) is the womb (*tai*); threefold and doubled, the nine *qi* are thus attained. Hence, within the golden chamber and jade hall, the embryo is nested in nine layers. Man receives his substance from yin and yang and binds his *hun* to the Three Terraces. The *hun* is yang, moving to generate life; the *po* is yin, still to stabilize. When man’s movement and stillness do not lose the harmony of yin and yang, his form is firmly secure. This is what is meant by the Three Terraces giving me life, nurturing me, and protecting me.\n\nThe Northern Dipper governs the source of water; the Southern Dipper governs the abode of fire—these two Dippers are the great agents of generation and completion. The Southern Dipper’s true yang fire is stored in *kan*; the Northern Dipper’s true one water is stored in *li*. The two *qi* ascend and descend, coming and going in union, achieving the hexagram *Jiji* (Completion). All things flourish and prosper—this is the foundation of the Dao. Water is the number one; multiplied by five, it becomes the Southern Dipper’s six stars. Fire is the number two; multiplied by five, it becomes the Northern Dipper’s seven stars. Each subtracts five to leave three—three is the number of generation, hence the Three Terraces. The stars of the Southern and Northern Dippers total thirteen; in man’s body, they correspond to thirteen matters. The Most High said: “Those who follow life are thirteen; those who follow death are thirteen.” This is the Dao. To know it and practice it is to live; to not know it and not practice it is to die. The handle of life and death lies in the power of yin and yang. The six stars of the Three Terraces represent three yin and three yang. This speaks of thirteen stars, yet the Three Terraces are not counted separately—they are within them. The Terrace stars number six, yet the Star Lords are three, for the three *qi* divide into six, called the Six *Qi*. Reunited, they become three; reunited again, the Six *Qi* are balanced, the Three Powers are at peace. Three transforms into six, six transforms into three—thus heaven and earth endure forever, without end.\n\n**True Talisman of the Three Terraces**\nThe true names and titles of these Perfected Lords cannot be heard. Whoever sees or hears them and can recite them possesses profound Daoist devotion and deep karmic affinity from past lives. To hear and recite them brings merit and power beyond measure.\n\nThe *Northern Dipper Original Destiny Sutra*, transmitted by the Thirty-Six Heavenly Star Controllers of Destiny and the Celestial Capital Protector of Life Great Heavenly Emperor, states: Long ago, when the Primordial Supreme Lord was expounding the Dao in the Jade Purity Yellow Ultimate Palace, a Perfected named Baoshang, foremost among the Heavenly Sons, stepped forward and asked: “The seven stars of the Central Heaven, majestic and resplendent, govern all luminaries, revolve the *qi* of destiny, and weigh life and death. Their awe-inspiring power is most profound. By what cause and condition do they hold this preeminent supremacy? From which kalpa did they arise, and what is the transformation of their beginning and end? I wish to hear this in detail.”\n\nThe Supreme Lord said: “Great is your question! In the distant Dragon Han kalpa, there was a king named Zhou Yu, whose sagely virtue knew no bounds. The people of his time enjoyed lifespans of eighty-four thousand great kalpas. The king had a jade consort, wise and compassionate, named the Purple Light Lady. In the kalpas of dust, she had already vowed to bear a sagely son to assist heaven and earth and aid in creation. After three thousand kalpas, she was born in this king’s era. On an early spring day, when a hundred flowers bloomed in splendor, she strolled in the rear garden and came to the Golden Lotus Flower Warm Jade Pool. There, she disrobed to bathe and suddenly felt a stirring. Nine lotus buds appeared and opened in due time, giving birth to nine sons. The two eldest were the Heavenly Sovereign Great Emperor and the Purple Tenuity Great Emperor. The seven younger sons became the Seven Stars, who, whether good or ill, transformed and guided the multitudes. After seven days and nights in the jade pool, they coalesced into radiant light and flew to the Central Ultimate, ninety million *li* from earth, where they transformed into nine great treasure palaces. The two eldest sovereigns resided in the Purple Tenuity Enclosure’s Grand Void Palace at the *Gouchen* position, wielding the floating tower, upholding the principles of primordial transformation, and serving as the lords of all stars.”\n\nThe Venerable Lady of Purple Radiance, honored as the Heavenly Empress of the Nine Perfected Saints of Virtue and Power of the Northern Dipper. Such are the names and titles of these True Lords—had they not been revealed by the Treasure Supreme, expounded by the Jade Purity, and personally bestowed by the Heavenly Sovereign upon the Celestial Master, they would remain unknown to the world. Those who hear and recite them do so by virtue of profound Dao-mind and long-cultivated good affinity; if they further uphold the scripture and practice its teachings, their merit shall be beyond all reckoning.\n\nFor faithful men and women who encounter this true scripture, their wisdom-nature is complete. Those who believe and revere it foresee events before they arise and illumine them as they occur; their nature moves in perfect roundness, like a ring without end, never stagnating upon things. The Dao-mind unfolds—this mind, pure in celestial principle, awakens and manifests, transcending the paths of dark delusion and penetrating the gates of the mysterious and wondrous. It departs from the byways of confusion, enters the Gate of the Inaudible and Invisible, returns to the true lineage, and attains the realm of flourishing life.\n\nTo seek and return to it is to serve the true lineage—*true* signifies no need for external pursuit, while *lineage* refers to the Lords of the Northern Dipper. To comprehend and awaken to this is to enter the realm of flourishing—*flourishing* denotes the unborn and undying, and *realm* encompasses the domains of humans and heavens, all by virtue of encountering this true scripture.\n\nOn the Three Primordials—\nthe fifteenth day of the first month of the Upper Primordial,\nthe fifteenth day of the seventh month of the Middle Primordial,\nand the fifteenth day of the tenth month of the Lower Primordial—\nthe Three Officials of the Three Primordials, who govern the hundred bureaus, ascend to the heavenly courts to present the records of human transgressions and blessings, weighing their depth and severity. They convene in the Dipper Palace, and thus one should perform the Dao, recite the scriptures, and conduct rites.\n\nOn the Eight Nodal Days—\nthe four *li* (spring, autumn, winter, summer beginnings),\nthe two solstices,\nand the two equinoxes—\nthe Eight Radiant Sovereigns and the Five Emperors descend to record human good and evil. As the nodal *qi* stirs in response to destiny, transgressions bring calamitous *qi*, while merit summons blessed *qi*; on these days, one should perform the Dao and recite the scriptures.\n\nOn the *Benming* Days—\nthe *jiazi* of one’s birth year, which recurs every sixty days—\nand on one’s Birthday—\nthe day of one’s birth, when the myriad spirits of the body gather—\none should perform the Dao and recite the scriptures to repay the grace of the stars’ illumination and the toil of one’s parents.\n\nOn the Days of the Northern Dipper’s Descent—\nthe twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth days of the first month;\nthe second, seventh, twenty-third, and twenty-sixth days of the second month;\nthe twenty-sixth day of the third month;\nthe seventeenth and twenty-seventh days of the fourth month;\nthe fifth, thirteenth, and twentieth days of the fifth month;\nthe fourth and eighth days of the sixth month;\nthe fourth and twenty-fourth days of the seventh month;\nthe third, eleventh, nineteenth, and twenty-seventh days of the eighth month;\nthe third and eighteenth days of the ninth month;\nthe tenth and twenty-sixth days of the tenth month;\nthe first, ninth, seventeenth, and twenty-fifth days of the eleventh month;\nand the twentieth day of the twelfth month.\n(For intercalary months, follow the preceding month.)\n\nThe above are the days when the Northern Dipper descends to traverse the earthly realm. Additionally, the *gengshen* and *jiazi* days, as well as the third and seventh days of each month, are also considered days of the Northern Dipper’s descent.\n\nWhen one solemnly establishes an altar, recites the scriptures, and performs the fast and offerings in accordance with the rites, the blessings are boundless. Life after life, one shall not stray from true nature nor fall into heterodox views. Those who uphold this scripture and constantly recite the honorific titles of the Seven Perfected Lords of the Primordials shall perfect their good merit and summon auspiciousness.\n\n*Solemnly* denotes reverence, caution, and meticulous order; *establishes* means to erect. The *altar* refers to the platform constructed for fasts and offerings, where one recites the scriptural texts and follows the ritual forms to perform the Dao. The power of such blessings is vast, extending universally without limit. Life after life, one turns toward truth and away from falsehood, never losing one’s true nature. When cultivation reaches this point, the empty chamber fills with light, and auspiciousness naturally arrives.\n\nThen is spoken the Incantation of the Northern Dipper:\n\nThis incantation of the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper originates from the True Rites of the Heavenly Heart. It dispels evil and cures illness, serving all purposes—truly the great incantation of the numinous texts beneath the Dipper.\n\nThe Nine Luminaries of the Northern Dipper, Great Spirits of the Central Heaven.\nThe Nine Luminaries refer to the Seven Stars and the two honored stars of the Sovereigns. The incantation includes the names of all nine, though later generations altered it to the Seven Stars, omitting the two luminaries.\n\nA note explains: In heaven, they are called *spirits*; on earth, *numina*; among humans, *ghosts*. Only humans occupy the middle realm. Those who cultivate may ascend to become immortals or descend to become numinous beings, while those who do not cultivate perish when their *qi* is exhausted, becoming ghosts. Ghosts, in turn, may transform into humans. Only humans are capable of all transformations and all penetrations.\n\nThe Northern Dipper is the honored one of the Central Heaven, the chief of the Three Spirits, and thus called the Great Spirit.\nAscending to the Golden Gates,\nThe Golden Gates of the Jade Capital are the capital of the August Emperor of the Void. The Northern Dipper serves as a minister to the Three Pure Ones and the Jade Emperor, hence it is said to ascend and pay homage.\n\nDescending to cover Kunlun,\nKunlun Mountain is the peak of the heavens, located within the Eight Seas. It stands at the center of the sky, its shape like an inverted canopy, broad above and narrow below. In three tiers, it rises to the level of the heavens, aligning with the center of the ten thousand degrees. The yellow and red paths intersect upon it, and the Three Luminaries traverse it.\n\nTo the east, it is called Kunlun; to the west, Dark Garden; to the north, Towering Wind; to the south, Accumulated Stones. A great precipice and springs lie at its northern gate. The mountain spans ten thousand *li* on each of its four sides. At its summit stand palaces of jasper blossoms and terraces of luminous jade. The Jasper Pool and Emerald Waters are where the Queen Mother of the West governs the host of perfected beings.\n\nAt the mountain’s highest peak stand five golden terraces, twelve jade towers, and nine layers of golden walls. The earth gives rise to trees of golden roots and forests of jasper branches, bearing fruits of plain blossoms. There are jasper springs and jade streams, purple phoenixes and emerald simurghs, green peaches and purple crabapples. A hundred treasures adorn it, beyond all reckoning.\n\nThe palaces where the Dipper and Pole Star reside each number five, each with five gates, and each gate emits fourfold radiance, blazing to illuminate ninety thousand *li*. Below, they govern the nine *qi* and eight luminaries, each presiding over a celestial region. The four *qi* give rise to life, and at their center stands the Pillar of Heaven, ascending to the Celestial Pass. They encompass the thirty-five divisions of the Upper Prime, each serving as the great life-generating pivot of the celestial mechanism—thus it is said they overspread Kunlun.\n\nThey regulate the cosmic order: the nine celestial bodies are the scions of the August Ultimate, governing the numbers of the Three and Five to harmonize the great transformations. From these transformations emerge the Five Phases, Five Affairs, Eight Governances, Five Constants, Three Powers, divination rites, myriad policies, Five Blessings, and their applications. Truly aligning with the human Dao to rectify the cosmic order—thus did Yao follow the August Heaven, and Shun align the Seven Governors.\n\nThey command and encompass Heaven and Earth, enveloping the cosmos—thus it is called \"command and control.\"\n\nThe names of the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper are: Great Culmen (Pole Star), Greedy Wolf, Giant Gate, Wealth Storage, Literary Curvature, Integrity and Chastity, Martial Curvature, and Broken Army. These are the titles of the Star Lords, inscribed upon their true forms.\n\nThe Highest Jade Emperor is the most revered star within the Dipper, residing near the first star in the Dipper’s bowl. Those who behold it attain a lifespan of six hundred years.\n\nThe Purple Tenuity Emperor Lord is the imperial star within the Dipper, also called the Grand Tenuity Emperor Lord. It lies near the fourth star in the Dipper’s bowl, and those who see it live three hundred years. These two august stars serve as the teachers of all phenomena and the focal point toward which the host of stars pay homage.\n\nThe Seven Perfected of the Northern Dipper declare: \"Our ancestral master, the Northern Culmen, through kalpas of diligent devotion—offering incense and lamps to the Three Clarities—fulfilled his merit and perfected his virtue. Ascending into the Purple Tenuity, he comes and goes with a canopy of blossoms following, his starlight ever resplendent with the seven treasures, shining upward to the heavens and downward to the ten thousand lands. On the third and twenty-seventh days of each month, he descends to inspect the good and evil of humankind.\"\n\nIn former times, Guo Ziyi, Prince of Fenyang, encountered an immortal who taught him the method of observing the stars. He was told: \"On the third and twenty-seventh nights of each month, in the stillness of night, let no one know. Secretly descend to the central courtyard and gaze upon the Dipper. If you see two stars whose radiance is as vast as a chariot wheel, these are the two august imperial stars. Do not speak of this to others, and you may attain longevity.\" Guo Ziyi, preoccupied with state affairs, did not practice this, but his maidservant, Huanche Jie, who attended him in his chamber, secretly read these words in his pillow book. She practiced in secret and succeeded in beholding them. Even in the Song dynasty, she remained within the palace. Today, the days when the Northern Culmen descends originate from this.\n\nThe great expanse of the celestial realm extends even to the finest mote of dust. The *qi* of yin and yang, vast as the turning heavens or minute as a speck of dust—what do they not reach? What calamity do they not extinguish? What blessing do they not bring to fruition? \"To fruition\" means to arrive and to gather. All misfortunes and disasters are entirely dissolved, and all auspicious fortunes naturally converge—this is what is meant by \"calamities and obstacles cannot intrude, all depending on the generation of a hundred blessings.\"\n\nThe primordial and august *qi* comes to merge with my body. The *Jue of Absorbing the Primordial August Qi* states: \"Azure, black, yellow, red, white, green, crimson, jade-green, and profound light—from one to nine, absorb the *qi* and consume the primordial yellow. Daily, unite with the august *qi*. The seven orifices generate radiant blossoms. After nine years, merit and practice are fulfilled, and one enters to serve in the Nine Morning Chambers.\"\n\nThe method states: The primordial yellow and august *qi* are the true *qi* of the Eight Trigrams and Nine Palaces, descending from the Nine August Ones to generate the ten thousand existences.\n\nThe First, Yang Brightness: the divine person exhales the light of azure *qi*.\nThe Second, Yin Essence: the divine person exhales the light of black *qi*.\nThe Third, Perfected Person: the divine person exhales the light of yellow *qi*.\nThe Fourth, Profound Darkness: the divine person exhales the light of red *qi*.\nThe Fifth, Cinnabar Prime: the divine person exhales the light of white *qi*.\nThe Sixth, Northern Culmen: the divine person exhales the light of green *qi*.\nThe Seventh, Heavenly Impulse: the divine person exhales the light of crimson *qi*.\nThe Eighth, Assistant Star: the divine person exhales the light of jade-green *qi*.\nThe Ninth, Adjuvant Star: the divine person exhales the light of profound *qi*.\n\nThe method of absorbing *qi* is as follows: During the first, fourth, seventh, and tenth months—the four *meng* months—practice at dawn on the first nine days of the first decade. During the second, fifth, eighth, and eleventh months—the four *zhong* months—practice at noon on the nineteenth day of the middle decade. During the third, sixth, ninth, and twelfth months—the four *ji* months—practice at midnight on the twenty-ninth day of the last decade. Perform this thrice monthly—at dawn, noon, and midnight—adjusting according to the *meng*, *zhong*, and *ji* months. Over a year, this amounts to thirty-six sessions, corresponding to the three hundred sixty degrees of the celestial sphere, with five as the surplus to complete the *qi*.\n\nOn the days and hours of practice, enter a purified chamber, burn incense, and concentrate the mind. Close the eyes, hold the breath, and click the teeth nine times. Visualize the divine lords of the Nine Palaces and star mansions seated in majesty, surrounded by an awe-inspiring retinue. Silently recite the incantation: *\"The great divine of the Northern Dipper’s primordial epoch in the center of heaven arrives... [missing characters]... august emperor, swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!\"*\n\nThen see the nine *qi* descending from the stars and flowing into the mouth. With each breath, exhale the old *qi* and gradually inhale the new *qi*, ensuring no sound reaches the ears. Swallow the nine-colored *qi* completely, click the teeth nine times, and suddenly forget all. Body and spirit unite in subtlety. Whether sitting, lying, moving, or resting, maintain harmonious adjustment. Practicing thus for nine years, the Nine Star Lords will descend to bestow upon you their secrets. You will become a long-lived immortal, ascend to the Three Heavens, befriend the host of perfected beings, and merge with the Dao in truth.\n\nThe handle of the Dipper points ceaselessly, day and night revolving. The Dipper’s handle in the heavens turns without error, moving from *zi* to *hai*, shifting one position each watch. As the poem says, \"All day long, the seven attendants\"—this is it.\n\nAnnotation: Each month, it constantly adds to *xu*; at all times, Broken Army is visible. To receive the true *qi*, one should face this direction.\n\nThe term \"vulgar dweller\" is a self-deprecating title used by disciples of the Dao, referring to themselves as \"walking corpses in a defiled world\" or \"filthy beings of the mortal realm.\" In old manuscripts, the character *su* (俗) was half-eroded by bookworms, leaving only its lower portion; later scholars mistakenly reconstructed it as *ke* (恪) or *ge* (格), and more recently, it has been further corrupted to *ge* (隔) based on pronunciation.\n\nThose who cherish the Dao and seek the numinous do so by revering the mysterious and efficacious scriptures and oral instructions, pursuing their profound wonders. They wish to behold the august countenance and forever preserve long life. *Yi* (仪) refers to the form and appearance—the true visage of the exalted Emperor. As the method states: \"May your servant soon behold it; beholding it is long life.\"\n\nThe Three Terraces are void and essence,\nThe Six Curved Stars give birth and life,\nThey nourish and sustain me,\nThey guard my body and form.\n\nThe annotations for the above are found in the preceding section on the sacred titles.\n\n[Missing text] the exalted Emperor, swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!\n\nThe names and taboo characters of the Nine Stars are all annotated in the preceding section on the sacred titles. Whenever practitioners of this scripture reach this point, they must redouble their sincerity and reverence, visualize the august countenance, and silently recite the invocation while clicking their teeth.\n\n*Taishang Xuanling Beidou Benming Yansheng Jing Zhu*, Middle Scroll, concludes.\n\nAnnotation:\n1. *Shi* (氏) should be corrected to *Di* (氐).\n2. *Jinmiu* (近谬) in *Taishang Xuanling Beidou Benming Yansheng Zhenjing Zhu* and *Taishang Xuanling Beidou Benming Yansheng Zhenjing Zhujie* is rendered as *mimiu* (迷谬), which is correct.\n3. *Guīyī* (归依) aligns with *Taishang Xuanling Beidou Benming Yansheng Zhenjing Zhujie*, while *Taishang Xuanling Beidou Benming Yansheng Zhenjing Zhu* has *guīzhēn* (归真).\n4. *Yǎn* (偃) should be corrected to *qū* (驱).\n5. The four characters *fùhéwéi sān* (复合为三) are likely superfluous.\n\n*Taishang Xuanling Beidou Benming Yansheng Jing Zhu*, Lower Scroll, annotated by Fu Dongzhen.\n\nThe Lord Lao declares: For all people, their nature, life, and five bodies are entirely governed by the star officials of their original destiny. \"Nature\" refers to the celestial mandate of one's nature; \"life\" means that which transforms yet remains unchanging; \"five bodies\" are the two hands, two feet, and head. The \"star officials of original destiny\" denote the star officials corresponding to the sixty *jiazi* cyclical years. Whatever Heaven bestows and humanity receives is all under the governance of these star officials of original destiny, without the slightest deviation.\n\nThe divine generals of one’s original destiny—these refer to the celestial stems and branches of one’s birth year, month, day, and hour, as well as the year, month, day, and hour of gestation, collectively termed \"fetal birth.\" They comprise the eight divine generals: the *yin-yang*, male-female, reverse-sequential, and fate-bound generals, along with the generals of *lu* (禄) and *ma* (马) *qi*, the attendant officials of original destiny, the talismanic spirits, and the scribal deities.\n\nThe star officials of one’s original constellation—these are the twenty-eight stellar sovereigns of the lunar lodges. There are two types of original constellation stars: first, the star sovereign presiding over the year of one’s birth. For instance, in the *jiazi* year, the Horn Lodge governs the year, making the Horn Lodge’s Celestial Gate Star Sovereign the star official of one’s original constellation. The second type is determined by the \"fowl divination\" method to fix the star of fetal breath and life, with three positions governing the three *yuan* (元) and three fate-bound periods—also termed the star officials of one’s original constellation. They perpetually bestow hidden protection, sustaining human life to preserve one’s celestial years. The span of celestial years is one hundred and twenty years. Those who uphold the Dao of the *Beidou Scripture for Extending Life* will find their divine generals of original destiny and star officials of their original constellation constantly shielding them, governing their life to fulfill their allotted years. Yet the common folk, lacking understanding, remain oblivious throughout their lives. The impure substance of the womb, devoid of awareness, never comprehends this principle.\n\nThe true officials of original destiny descend to the mortal realm six times each year, and the day of their descent marks the fate-bound period of one’s original destiny. Whenever this day arrives, it becomes the appointed limit—once every sixty days, six times a year. When the true officials descend, the fate-bound period of one’s original destiny spans one hundred and twenty years as two limits: sixty years as a minor limit, and one hundred twenty years as the major limit. When the limit is exhausted, death follows. Should one violate prohibitions and offend against their allotted years, their fate-bound period shortens. But those who accumulate yang merits, perform yin virtues, adhere to precepts and prohibitions, and revere the celestial mandate will find their limit extended—and with the extension of their limit, their life is prolonged.\n\nThere are three thousand Southern Mound Envoys, transformations of yang, where three *qi* coalesce into spirits.\n\nThe Seven Thousand Divine Generals of the Northern Dipper True Lord are transformations of yin, where seven *qi* coalesce into spirits. When the True Official of one’s original destiny descends in majesty, all the perfected beings gather to protect and shield. This can dispel calamities, repent sins, invoke blessings, and prolong life. According to one’s capacity, one may present petitions and perform jiao rites, thereby augmenting and exalting their fortune and virtue. On the day of the descent, all the perfected beings arrive to guard and defend, and one may present petitions, perform jiao rites, repent sins, dispel calamities, prolong life, and invoke blessings. According to one’s capacity, one may establish merit, thereby augmenting and exalting their fortune and virtue.\n\nShould the limit of one’s original destiny be approaching and one remains unaware, failing to prepare vegetarian feasts or jiao rites, neglecting incense and offerings—this is to treat life lightly, to be deluded about one’s origin, and to disdain the human form. The celestial bureaus will strip away one’s emoluments, reduce one’s allotted years, and curtail one’s lifespan, often leading to premature death. If, as the limit of one’s original destiny approaches, one remains unaware, failing to prepare vegetarian feasts or jiao rites, to uphold the scriptural precepts, or to pay homage to the Dipper Perfected—this is to treat this life lightly, to forget one’s origin, and to debase one’s own body. The celestial bureaus will surely strip away one’s emoluments, reduce one’s allotted years, and thus many will die prematurely, unable to fulfill their destined years.\n\nThose who are deluded, even if they encounter the scriptural precepts, harbor disbelief and slander the true texts. Such individuals, after their bodies perish, will sink into the Three Wretched Realms and drift through the Six Destinies, forever losing the human form. Deeply lamentable, they bring this suffering upon themselves. Human delusion and error, even when encountering the scriptural precepts, lead some to harbor disbelief and even slander. After death, they fall into the Three Wretched Realms and Six Destinies, never again to attain a human body. As the saying goes: \"Heaven-made calamities may yet be avoided, but self-made calamities are inescapable.\" Though the Heavenly Worthy, moved by compassion, may arouse pity, the enforcers of the law must often grant leniency.\n\nIf, on the day of one’s original destiny, one prepares vegetarian feasts and jiao rites, and skillfully petitions the celestial bureaus, then for one lifetime at the limit of one’s original destiny, one may recite the true scriptures, abundantly present offerings, and thereby ensure that for three lifetimes one will always be reborn as a man—wealthy, noble, intelligent, and preeminent among humanity. If, on the day of one’s original destiny in this life, one adheres to the precepts and prohibitions, recites the true scriptures, and grandly performs vegetarian feasts and jiao rites, then for three lifetimes one will be reborn as a man—wealthy, noble, intelligent, and uniquely distinguished among humanity.\n\nFor those whose karmic endowment in this life is meager, though born among humanity, they may be poor and lowly. Even if they know their original destiny but lack the means to perform grand rites, if they can pour water and offer flowers, sincerely face the North Pole, bow their heads in reverence, and invoke the name of the True Lord of their original destiny, they will not pass their destined limit in vain. They will all attain life prolongation and fortune inscription, perpetually retaining the human form. Calamities will be dispelled, and boundless blessings will be obtained. If one is born poor and lowly, though aware of their original destiny, lacks the means to establish merit, yet can pour water and offer flowers, devoutly face the North Pole, bow their heads in reverence, and invoke the name of the Northern Dipper’s Star Lord of their original destiny, they will not pass their destined day in vain. They will all attain life prolongation and fortune inscription, perpetually retaining the human form. Calamities will be forever dispelled, and boundless blessings will be obtained.\n\nThe Heavenly Master rejoiced, leapt with joy, and bowed in reverence, praising the rarity of encountering this unsurpassed Dharma Bridge. The Heavenly Master, having received the scriptural Dharma, rejoiced and praised it, likening it to a Dharma Bridge—its crossing is endless, truly rare to encounter.\n\nThe Old Lord further addressed the Heavenly Master: The sins and blessings, good and evil of worldly people all belong to the celestial bureaus. To repent sins and dispel calamities, nothing surpasses cultivation and reverence. The sins and blessings, good and evil of worldly people are all governed by the Dipper Spirits. If one wishes to repent and cleanse transgressions, to dispel and avert calamities, nothing surpasses preparing vegetarian feasts, performing jiao rites, and cultivating reverence in accordance with the scriptures.\n\nOn the day of one’s original destiny, the day of the body’s inscription at the Zhongyuan Festival, and the day of the Yuanchen—there are two types of Yuanchen. The first is based on the Northern Dipper’s Seven Origins establishing life, where the Star Lord of one’s original destiny has left and right assistants as the Yuanchen. For yang men and yin women, the position preceding the clash is called the Yuanchen; for yin men and yang women, the position following the clash is called the Yuanchen. For example, if a man is born in the *zi* hour, *Tanlang* is the Star Lord of his original destiny, and *Zuofu* is the Yuanchen Star Lord. If a woman is born in the *zi* hour, *Tanlang* is the Star Lord of her original destiny, and *Youbi* is the Yuanchen Star Lord. If a man is born in the *chou* or *hai* hour, *Jumen* is the Star Lord of his original destiny, and *Youbi* is the Yuanchen Star Lord; for a woman, *Zuofu* is the Yuanchen Star Lord. The rest follow this pattern.\n\nThe second type is based on the sixty *jiazi* cycles as the Star Officials of one’s original destiny. In the Mysterious Numinosity method, they are called the Great Generals of the Original Destiny. For example, if a man is born in the *jiazi* year, *xinhai* is the Yuanchen Star Official; for a woman, *jisi* is the Yuanchen Star Official. If a man is born in the *yichou* year, *renwu* is the Yuanchen Star Official; for a woman, *jiashen* is the Yuanchen Star Official. The rest follow this pattern. Further, within the Five *Zi* Origins, one may discern the true and false. On these days, when the Yuanchen descends, one should purify the body, observe abstinence, practice the Dao, and recite scriptures.\n\nThe Yuanchen must never be offended. If one is born under the Yuanchen’s influence in one’s destiny, one will not escape its misfortunes in this lifetime. Though this is predetermined by heavenly mandate, one may repent and make amends on the day of the Yuanchen’s descent, transforming calamities into blessings. The Star Lords, Star Officials, Divine Generals, talismanic clerks, and their retinues of one’s original destiny hold positions of lord and minister, with clear distinctions of rank—yet people remain unaware of this.\n\nThe Post Horse: The Five Blessings Post Horse Divine Lord is an auspicious spirit of one’s original destiny. For those born in the *shen-zi-chen* years, it resides in the *yin* position; for those born in the *si-you-chou* years, it resides in the *hai* position; for those born in the *yin-wu-xu* years, it resides in the *shen* position; for those born in the *hai-mao-wei* years, it resides in the *si* position. The position corresponding to the decade of one’s birth is the primary position.\n\nThe Three Calamities of Diminution and Nine Adversities of Misfortune—this annotation refers to the preceding text on preserving one’s present kin and ensuring their peace. The *Scripture of Central Prohibitions* states: \"The people flicker like fireflies, each bearing a star. Every person has their own star of original destiny, with their own calamities and blessings. Yet, in general, these must follow the master *qi*. For a nation, the emperor and his ministers are the master *qi*; for a household, the family head is the master *qi*.\"\n\nThe master *qi* endowed with the Dao can reverse celestial principles, transform calamity into fortune—my destiny lies within me, not in Heaven. This Dao encompasses Heaven and Earth, grasps yin and yang, and thus neither great fate can constrain it nor can yin and yang assail it. Yet if one fails to practice the Dao and perform meritorious deeds, one cannot escape the bounds of destiny.\n\nDuring the critical junctures of yearly and monthly adversities, one should await the resolution of hardship. If, however, one recklessly squanders life and loses sight of its origin, failing to cherish the human form, indulging in the three karmic actions, and unrestrainedly pursuing the six senses, accumulating transgressions and multiplying offenses, calamities will inevitably strike with severity. This may extend to implicating one’s kin, bringing misfortune upon the entire household—no small matter indeed.\n\nWhy is this so? Because the six relations and family members all arise from the primordial origin of one’s own destiny. For instance, those who give birth to me are my mother; those who raise me are my father; those of the same kind are my siblings; those I restrain are my wife and wealth; those I engender are my children and grandchildren—all stem from the primordial origin of my destiny. Furthermore, adding the number of months from one’s birth month to the hour of birth determines the \"destiny official.\" For men and women, these are arranged in reverse or sequential order, forming the twelve positions: first, the Palace of Destiny; second, the Palace of Wealth; third, the Palace of Siblings; fourth, the Palace of Fields and Dwellings; fifth, the Palace of Children and Grandchildren; sixth, the Palace of Servants; seventh, the Palace of Wives and Concubines; eighth, the Palace of Jealousy and Adversity; ninth, the Palace of Migration; tenth, the Palace of Official Rank and Emolument; eleventh, the Palace of Fortune and Virtue; twelfth, the Palace of Appearance. Applying the three *yuan*, four residences, and five phases, along with the stems and branches, to these positions, as they move through the yearly positions and the limits of one’s fate, one encounters calamity as calamity and fortune as fortune. Thus, one should first invoke and supplicate the primordial origin of one’s destiny and the *Yima* deity.\n\nThe primordial origin is one’s heart. For all people, the primordial origin is outwardly manifested in the eyes and inwardly concealed in the heart. The eyes survey the myriad things externally, while the heart races internally through the ten thousand affairs. Wherever the heart and eyes roam, the spirit also hastens—hence it is called the *Yima* of the primordial origin, ceaselessly galloping through affairs without respite.\n\nIf one can gather the heart and return to inner illumination, preserving the mysterious numen within, then one halts the galloping horse to manure the fields, inwardly nurturing form and spirit, solidifying embryonic breathing. Thereafter, the Three Corpses depart the body, the Nine Worms perish, and from whence could the Three Calamities and Nine Adversities arise? In due time, one receives destiny, and the hundred spirits harmonize and flourish—this is what is meant by the peace and tranquility of one’s kin.\n\nWhenever an adept—one who cultivates the Dao—holds this true scripture on their destiny’s birthdate, they externally subdue demonic spirits and internally pacify their true nature. Those who cultivate the Dao are called adepts; reciting this scripture on their destiny’s birthday enables them to externally subdue demonic spirits and internally nourish spirit and nature, naturally attaining the Dao and achieving perfection. Their merit extends to the realms of water and land; those who achieve the Dao bestow their virtue upon all beings, so that creatures that fly, walk, sink, or hide all receive its blessings.\n\nIts blessings extend to both the living and the departed; when one attains the Dao, their kin find peace and tranquility, and the nine generations of ancestors and seven lineages of descendants all receive its grace. Through repentance and reverence, one gradually ascends to the wondrous fruit. By reestablishing profound merit and realizing the Dao of emptiness and non-being, one attains the perfect wisdom of the sages, their presence as elusive as the hidden radiance, moving between existence and non-existence, roaming the clouds at will, ascending through the Golden Gate to unite with the sacred and true. Their form transcends the Three Realms, forever freed from the cycle of rebirth, their lifespan boundless, their joy and freedom complete.\n\nWhen one repents with reverence, the wondrous fruit and profound merit may be attained and established—this is the Dao, the inexhaustible source of life and transformation, the ceaseless flow of existence. Human life arises from emptiness and non-being, where spirit transforms into qi, and qi transforms into essence, thus taking form. The way of its application: the wise do not expend it externally but direct it inward, so that essence returns to qi, qi returns to spirit, and refining spirit to merge with the Dao, one reattains the wondrous state of emptiness and non-being. Spirit transforms without fixed form—this is the work of the sages. To know all things is to possess wisdom that pervades the myriad beings, yet the subtle and mysterious, the profoundly unknowable, remain beyond comprehension. Thus, their presence is as elusive as hidden radiance, moving between existence and non-existence, roaming the clouds at will, ascending through the Golden Gate. Form and spirit both attain perfection, uniting with the Dao in truth, returning together to the great transformation of the Three Purities. No longer bound by the cycle of rebirth, their lifespan knows no end, and they abide in carefree non-action, their primordial destiny fulfilled.\n\nWhenever men or women, on their destiny’s birthdate or during days of purification, purify body and mind, burn incense, and hold this true scripture; recognizing the star lord of their destiny under the Northern Dipper and offering sincere prayers, no good shall go unanswered. Disasters and transgressions dissolve, and the ten thousand sages and thousand perfected beings all come to guard and protect.\n\nThe Orthodox Unity Perfected Master, Celestial Master Zhang of Han, spoke to his disciple Zhao Sheng: \"The human body possesses three hun-souls: one governs destiny, one governs wealth and rank, and one governs misfortune and decline. It is also said that one hun-soul resides in the celestial palace of its destined star, one in the earthly prison, and one within the body. The seven po-souls constantly dwell within and do not disperse. The hun-souls belong to yang and move to give life, while the po-souls belong to yin and remain still to stabilize the form.\n\nOn one’s destiny’s birthdate, when the hun-souls descend into the body and unite with the corpse, they observe its appearance—whether it is withered or robust, weak or strong. If the three hun-souls circulate and descend without cease, the living person remains at peace, and disasters and illnesses do not arise. If on that day one purifies body and mind, abstains from wine and lust, wears clean new garments, burns incense, and cultivates goodness, and further, rests briefly, then the hun-souls unite with the po-souls, yin and yang merge, the Dao-qi flourishes within, and the root of life is firmly secured.\n\nIf on that day one indulges in wine and lust, confusing and defiling the body, then when the hun-souls return, they remain three paces away from the body, unable to unite. Filth and impurity assail them, and the hun-souls retreat. If this confusion occurs three times, and the hun-souls fail to unite with the po-souls, then yang weakens and yin prevails, and the po-souls seize the opportunity. The po-souls are the transformation of yin and constantly seek to prevent the hun-souls from returning to the body. If the hun-souls do not return, the po-souls commune with yin spirits, and when yin unites with yin, the five ghosts flourish. This gives rise to wandering spirits and manifold evils, causing one to fall into an unrousable sleep, the five senses to become confused, and disasters and illnesses to arise, leading ultimately to death.\n\nWhen the hun-souls return but cannot unite with the body, they grieve and weep, while the po-souls leap and dance, laughing and singing: 'Return, but there is no union for me; return, but there is no abode for me.' Thus, the five ghosts invade the chamber, and the Three Corpses rage wildly. The Three Ones are not guarded, and the true dwelling becomes empty.\" The *Central Yellow Scripture* states: \"Alas! The twelve towers of the mysterious palace—who would have thought they would become the dwelling of the Three Corpses? How sorrowful!\"\n\nOn one’s destiny’s birthdate, six times a year, the three hun-souls return to the body six times to subdue the yin po-souls, preventing the incursion of demonic paths. The hundred spirits gather, the hun-souls find peace, the po-souls are rectified, and the myriad qi endure. Free from suffering and affliction, the body radiates light, preserving eternal life. One may ascend as a flying immortal. Moreover, on the day of one’s destiny’s birth, when the myriad spirits descend, during days of purification, one purifies body and mind, burns incense, recites the scripture, recognizes the star lord of their destiny under the Northern Dipper, and offers sincere prayers. Good intentions evoke responses, disasters and transgressions dissolve, and the ten thousand sages and thousand perfected beings all come to guard and protect—thus the Dao of immortality is swiftly attained.\n\nWherever this scripture resides, the thousand perfected pay reverence, and the ten thousand sages protect and uphold it. Demonic spirits vanish in silence, and malevolent spirits hide away. Worldly disasters and calamities all dissolve. When the scripture is held in the heart, the true sages within the body revere and protect it, so that demons cannot intrude, ghosts and spirits cannot bewitch, and the disasters and calamities of the world all vanish of themselves.\n\nThis is called the *Northern Dipper Destiny Prolonging Life Scripture and Its Instructions*, the path of cultivating the true. This scripture requires personal practice—it is the scripture and instructions for prolonging life on one’s destiny’s birthdate, the path of cultivating the true. Attaining the Dao and roaming freely, all depend on this scripture; realizing sagehood and becoming a perfected being, all depend on this scripture; transcending life and death, all depend on this scripture; protecting men and women, all depend on this scripture. Preserving life and prolonging years, all attain freedom. It is an eternal treasure for the body, bringing blessings and longevity. Guard and revere it; do not show it to the unworthy.\n\nThis is where the scripture’s personal practice lies: in small measure, it preserves life and prolongs years, increasing blessings and longevity; in great measure, it transcends life and death, attains the Dao and roams freely, realizes sagehood and becomes a perfected being, and endures as a treasure for the body. Guard and revere it; do not show it to the unworthy.\"\n\nAs Lord Lao finished expounding the scripture, dragons and cranes, celestial immortals, came to welcome him back to the Jade Capital. At that time, the Celestial Master, having received the wondrous dharma, spoke these words, vowing to propagate it and transmit it to the virtuous. \"If there are men or women who receive, uphold, and recite this scripture, I, together with the ten precept-enforcing immortal officials, shall protect and uphold them wherever they may be.\"\n\nThus, bowing again to Lord Lao, the Celestial Master offered this hymn of praise:\n\nAs Lord Lao concluded the scripture and prepared to return to the Jade Capital, the Celestial Master bowed in gratitude and spoke these words of praise.\n\n\"Within the household dwells the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*—\nNot the household of mere dwelling, but the household of this very body.\nOf the five viscera, the heart presides as sovereign;\nThe heart is the union of spirit,\nAnd where spirit abides, there is the household.\nThe heart’s form is inwardly void, yet within it water is stored—\nThat water is the *qi* of Heaven’s First, the essence of the Northern Dipper.\nThus the human heart bears seven apertures above, corresponding to the seven stars,\nAnd two below, answering to the Enlightening and Assisting Stars,\nWith three hairs to emulate the Three Terraces.\nWhen the mind wanders outward, spirit strays and departs;\nWhen the mind is settled inward, spirit rests in harmony.\nEven the attainment of the Dao and ascension to immortality reside within the heart.\nThus to say ‘within the household dwells the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*’\nMeans the heart upholds the scripture’s teachings without distraction.\nThe heart of Heaven remains unmoved, yet governs all with natural order—\nHow vast is the Dao of spontaneity!\n\nMoreover, at the moment of birth,\nThe Northern Dipper bestows its radiance within the heart.\nThe heart is the palace of numinous clarity,\nWhere all deeds—good and evil—take root.\nBefore desire even stirs in the heart, the Dipper already knows.\nHow can one not still the reckless mind?\n\nThe true spirit of one’s destiny descends—\nOnce the true spirit descends, life may be preserved and longevity extended.\n\nWithin the household dwells the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*,\nAnd the dwelling place attains peace and tranquility.\nThe heart is the abode of spirit; the body, the residence of *qi*.\nWhen one upholds the scripture’s teachings, heart and form naturally find peace.\n\nWithin the household dwells the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*,\nAnd father and mother are preserved in long life.\nThe father is the Mysterious Father; the mother, the Mysterious Mother—\nBoth born of spirit and *qi*.\nWhen the heart upholds the scripture’s teachings,\nThe Mysterious Father and Mysterious Mother naturally endure in long life.\n\nWithin the household dwells the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*,\nAnd all defilements dissolve into dust.\nFetal impurities are cleansed; blood corpses vanish.\nWhen one upholds the scripture’s teachings, body and mind become naturally pure.\n\nWithin the household dwells the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*,\nAnd the myriad deviations return to rectitude.\nJoy, anger, sorrow, fear, love, aversion, and desire—these seven are the deviations of emotion.\nWind, cold, heat, dampness, hunger, satiety, fatigue, and ease—these eight are the deviations of *qi*.\nWhen the heart upholds the scripture’s teachings, emotional deviations are wholly dispelled,\nAnd the *qi* of the Dao abides, naturally returning to true perfection.\n\nWithin the household dwells the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*,\nAnd enterprises prosper as desired.\nTrue *qi* refines and nurtures, giving life without end.\nWhen the heart upholds the scripture’s teachings,\nThe wondrous power of endless generation arises,\nAnd virtue and power attain fulfillment.\n\nWithin the household dwells the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*,\nAnd the entire household enjoys health and well-being.\nThe hundred joints and bones are suffused with true essence;\nThe nine gates of yang cinnabar seal off the *qi* of death.\nThis is how, when the heart upholds the scripture’s teachings,\nThe hundred joints naturally thrive in health.\n\nWithin the household dwells the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*,\nAnd descendants are preserved in glory and prosperity.\nDescendants all arise from the origin of one’s destiny—\nAs those who give me life are my mother,\nThose who raise me are my father,\nThose of the same kind are my siblings,\nThose I overcome are my wife,\nAnd those born of my wife are my descendants—\nAll arise from the origin of my destiny.\nWhen the heart upholds the scripture’s teachings,\nDescendants naturally enjoy glory and prosperity.\n\nWithin the household dwells the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*,\nAnd the five pathways are naturally unimpeded.\nWhen the heart upholds the scripture’s teachings,\nThe true *qi* of the five viscera and meridians flows freely and unobstructed.\n\nWithin the household dwells the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*,\nAnd all evils are forever extinguished.\nAll evils are demonic obstructions.\nThose who cultivate the true must first banish the host of demons.\nWhen the heart upholds the scripture’s teachings,\nDemonic obstacles do not intrude, and all evils vanish.\n\nWithin the household dwells the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*,\nAnd the six livestock thrive and flourish.\nThe three yin and three yang transform and nurture within the six meridians,\nManifesting as the Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior, Curved Array, and Striding Serpent.\nWhen the heart upholds the scripture’s teachings,\nThe six livestock naturally thrive in wholeness.\n\nWithin the household dwells the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*,\nAnd illnesses are cured and healed.\nWhen the heart upholds the scripture’s teachings,\nTrue *qi* fills and overflows the Three Palaces—\nHow could illness arise?\n\nWithin the household dwells the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*,\nAnd wealth and possessions are not squandered in vain.\nEssence and blood are replenished, transforming into *qi*;\n*Qi* in its efficacy congeals into spirit.\nWhen the heart upholds the scripture’s teachings,\nHow could the body’s treasures be depleted?\n\nWithin the household dwells the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*,\nAnd misfortunes never arise.\nThe inner realm does not leak outward; the outer realm does not intrude.\nWhen one upholds the scripture’s teachings,\nBody and mind remain free of stray thoughts—\nHow could misfortunes arise?\n\nWithin the household dwells the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*,\nAnd one perpetually abides in smoothness, advantage, harmony, and integrity.\nEver present as if enduring, spirit is concentrated in the Great One.\nThis is how, when the heart upholds the scripture’s teachings,\nOne perpetually preserves the auspiciousness of the four seasons.\"\n\nLord Lao said: \"Excellent! Excellent!\nYou may propagate the true teaching, bringing boundless blessings and benefits,\nUniversally bestowing them upon all beings, that they may forever partake in supreme goodness.\"\n\nLord Lao, deeming the Celestial Master’s hymn of praise to be most excellent, exclaimed \"Excellent! Excellent!\"—meaning it was the highest good—and commanded the Celestial Master to proclaim and expound this scripture’s teachings, that their boundless blessings might extend to those yet unawakened and to future multitudes, enabling them to receive these benefits forever.\n\nThe Celestial Master bowed his head in reverence, accepted the teaching with faith, and vowed to uphold and practice it.\n\n**Divine Incantation of the Northern Dipper for Longevity and Wisdom**\n\nThe Nine Stars of the Northern Dipper—\nJade Perfected Immortals and Spirits:\nGreedy Wolf and Great Gate preserve your servant’s long life;\nSalary Storage and Literary Curve grant your servant wisdom;\nIntegrity Chastity and Martial Tune guard your servant in peace;\nBreaking Army and Assisting Ministers protect your servant’s form.\nEver abiding in auspiciousness, forever dwelling in blessed longevity.\nInscribe my name in the register of the living; strike it from the ledger of the dead.\nSpirit clear and *qi* bright, penetrating the nine nether realms.\nCommanding demons and seizing ghosts, toppling grassy specters and overturning malevolence.\n\nTo study the Dao and cultivate truth is to fulfill one’s deepest aspirations.\nThe Nine August Sovereigns shelter and protect, ascending to the Purple Court of Heaven.\nYour servant’s heart is utterly devoted in reverent prayer.\n\nThis incantation is said to be the ancient invocation of immortals and sages when paying homage to the Dipper and burning incense. Whenever one burns incense and pays homage to the Dipper, reciting this incantation expresses the utmost sincerity in prayer. In older versions, the incantation concludes with *\"Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Ordinance of the Most High\"*—yet if this were truly proclaimed by the Most High to command the supreme Dipper, the incantation should not include the word *\"servant.\"* And if it already contains *\"servant,\"* then adding *\"swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Ordinance\"* would be inconsistent. Thus, the present version replaces it with *\"Your servant’s heart is utterly devoted in reverent prayer,\"* which is more fitting. If this incantation is used in prayer, no further supplications are needed. If a woman offers the prayer, the word *\"servant\"* should be changed to *\"handmaiden.\"*\n\nThe *Annotated Scripture of the Most High Numinous Northern Dipper for Prolonging Life and Destiny*, Lower Scroll, concludes here.",

      "translated_text": "**The Supreme Mysterious Numinous Northern Dipper Original Destiny Longevity Sutra with Commentary**\n\n**Title:** *The Supreme Mysterious Numinous Northern Dipper Original Destiny Longevity Sutra with Commentary*. Composed by the Song Daoist Fu Dongzhen. Centered on the inner cultivation of body and mind. In three fascicles. Base text from: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Wondrous Writings* section, *Jade Instructions* category.\n\n**Preface to The Supreme Mysterious Numinous Northern Dipper Original Destiny Longevity Sutra with Commentary**\n\nThe *Northern Dipper Sutra* was spoken by the Supreme Lord Lao and transmitted by the Han Celestial Master Tianyi. At that time, the sacred words proclaimed by Lord Lao were heard below by Celestial Master Tianyi, and thus the sutra was composed. How could one fail to embody the sagely teachings, embellishing them with literary grace, elucidating their hidden secrets, clarifying their aims and renunciations, and illuminating their subtle mechanisms of flourishing and decay?\n\nYet the verses of the sutra, often composed in parallel prose, have led some fools to conjecture: \"Its style resembles the works of the Han and Tang dynasties—surely it was composed by Celestial Master Du!\" If not Celestial Master Du, then it must be the work of Celestial Master Zhang. Such men, presuming upon the authority of these two Celestial Masters, dare to slander without evidence. Yet both Celestial Masters ascended in flight or dissolved in transformation, leaving behind writings of unparalleled elegance—how could they have produced such vulgar words?\n\nConsider the *Five Classics* and *Six Canons*, the books of the Hundred Schools, and the scriptures of the Buddhist tradition—if they were not composed by authors, how could they exist? Moreover, the Confucian texts, from antiquity to the present, have been endlessly annotated and revised, yet remain incomplete. How much more so the subtle and obscure words of the Dao, veiled in boundless mystery!\n\nThis sutra is recited by humans and devas alike, invoked for blessings and the aversion of calamities, and its efficacy is unfailing. Those who slander it are explicitly warned in the sutra: their destinies will sink into the six realms of rebirth, and they will lose their human form, a fate most lamentable, bringing such suffering upon themselves.\n\nDongzhen now composes this commentary to dispel the blasphemies of the ignorant and sever the roots of their delusion. Drawing upon the teachings of various scriptures and the words of former masters, I have elucidated them in detail, and further corroborated them with plain speech—this is to enlighten those of middling and lesser capacity. The superior and enlightened need not attend to it.\n\nRespectfully inscribed by Fu Dongzhen.\n\n---\n\n**The Supreme Mysterious Numinous Northern Dipper Original Destiny Longevity Sutra with Commentary, Fascicle One**\n*Commentary by Fu Dongzhen*\n\n\"Supreme\" (*tai*) denotes utmost greatness; \"highest\" (*shang*) signifies the most exalted. The term *taishang* (\"Supreme Highest\") signifies the greatest and most lofty. \"Mysterious\" (*xuan*) means subtle and wondrous; \"numinous\" (*ling*) refers to sagely transformation. As for the \"Northern Dipper,\" according to the *River Chart Sutra’s Lateral Correspondences Diagram*: the Northern Dipper is the essence-soul of the Nine Heavens, the spirit-soul of the Nine Earths, the wondrous image of the Nine Stars, and the majestic divinity of the Nine Provinces. \"Original destiny\" (*benming*) refers to the original destiny’s primordial alignment, which descends to the human realm six times each year to assess the transgressions and blessings of mortals. The *Longevity Sutra* is the path of cultivating the true.\n\nThe Three Qi of the Mysterious, Primordial, and Original: the Mysterious arises from Earth, the Primordial arises from humanity, and the Original arises from Heaven. Humanity models itself on Earth, Earth models itself on Heaven, Heaven models itself on the Dao, and the Dao models itself on spontaneity.\n\nHumanity models itself on Earth, hence it is called \"mysterious\" (*xuan*). Humanity is the most numinous of the myriad beings, hence it is called \"numinous\" (*ling*). The Dao generates the One, the One generates the Two, the Two generates the Three, and the Three generates the Nine. The Three Qi are the honor of Heaven and Earth, and the Nine Qi are the root of the myriad beings. The Northern Dipper resides in the Central Heaven, governing the Nine Qi. The Dao of Nine and One is unified in the Mysterious One.\n\nThe Mysterious arises from Earth and is modeled by humanity, hence it is called the \"Northern Dipper’s original destiny.\" When humans receive life, they differentiate from the One Qi. Born from Qi, they emerge from the Mysterious One. Having differentiated from Qi to be born, they should clarify their root and origin, and guard the Mysterious One to extend their life.\n\n---\n\n**At that time**\n\"At that time\" refers to the moment when the sutra was first spoken.\n\n**The Supreme Lord Lao**\nWhen Heaven and Earth first divided, the One Qi generated the Primordial Originator, the Two Qi generated the Primordial Sovereign, and the Three Qi generated Lord Lao. Lord Lao dwells below as the master of transformation. In Heaven, he is the lord of the myriad heavens; descending to the world, he is the teacher of the hundred kings. Among the stars, he is the Celestial August Emperor; in the teachings, he is the Supreme Lord Lao.\n\nAs for the \"Great Sage Lord Lao in the Grand Clarity Palace,\" this is incorrect.\n\n**In the first year of Yongshou, the seventh day of the first month**\n\"Yongshou\" was the reign era of Emperor Huan of the Han, corresponding to the year *yiwei* (155 CE), the seventh day of the first month.\n\n**In the Grand Ultimate Palace of the Supreme Clarity Realm**\nThe \"Supreme Clarity Realm\" is the domain where Lord Lao resides, and its palace is named the \"Three Sovereigns’ Grotto-Spirit Supreme Clarity Grand Ultimate Palace.\"",

      "translated_text": "The *Scripture of Opening Heaven* states: At the summit of the Round Canopy lies the Heaven of Great Veil Beyond, the realm of the Three Clarities. The Sacred Realm of Jade Clarity encompasses twelve sacred heavens; below Jade Clarity lies the Perfected Realm of Supreme Clarity with twelve perfected heavens; below Supreme Clarity lies the Immortal Realm of Grand Clarity with twelve immortal heavens; beneath Grand Clarity are the four heavens of the four kinds of beings; below these are the four heavens of the Formless Realm; beneath the Formless Realm are the eighteen heavens of the Form Realm; below the Form Realm are the six heavens of the Desire Realm; beneath the Desire Realm, the void connects to the central axis, and below lies the human realm. The Three Clarities, three realms, and thirty-six heavens give rise to the myriad beings of the Three Realms, their forms flowing in all directions. Below, each generates fifty-five thousand five hundred fifty-five billion worlds without limit. In all eight directions of this earth and heaven, each is a great chiliocosm of three thousand worlds, all receiving the Three Clarities and Three Origins.\n\nThe thirty-six heavens above and below correspond to the thirty-six terrestrial divisions of the nine provinces in each of the four directions, aligning with the thirty-six celestial gates of the heavenly mechanism. Thus, the Three Powers share qi, heaven and humanity respond to one another, and all receive life from the Dao.\n\nThe realm of Grand Clarity lies below Jade Clarity and Supreme Clarity yet above the myriad heavens of the Three Realms. One version mistakenly places it within the Grand Clarity Palace.\n\nBeholding sentient beings, the Supreme Lord ever abides in his palace, gazing in the four directions upon the world below, compassionately pitying all beings. For kalpas uncounted, they drift and sink, revolving through birth and death. Human lives, failing to awaken, drift in bitter destinies, trapped in the wheel of birth and death, enduring kalpas without end. Some dwell in the human realm, born in the Central Lands; others are born among the Yi and Di barbarians or within the lands of the Man and Rong tribes. The human realm is one of the six destinies; within the Central Lands, the four barbarians, and the eight wastes, all beings with the three karmas and five encumbrances belong to the human realm. One version mistakenly writes \"barbarian domains.\"\n\nSome are rich, some noble, some lowly, some poor—all temporarily bound by karmic conditions, even falling into hell. Whether they do good or evil, create blessings or transgressions, human hearts differ, and karmic retributions vary. The netherworld records all without error. Yet because there is no constancy—constancy being the root of nature and appearance, the gateway to transcendence—people of the most ancient times required no cultivation, for their minds were ever constant. This was because their purity remained undivided and their great simplicity unscattered. In later ages, human hearts grew shallow and crafty, scheming and opportunism arose, purity and simplicity dissolved, and the roots of transgression grew. With no place for the mind to arise, they became ever more distant from the Dao.\n\nThus, Lord Lao crossed westward to Kashmir, established the Gate of Prajñā, expounded the mind’s dharma, and broadly discoursed on the scriptural teachings to guide all toward awakening. Yet how can people of the degenerate age, their eyes coveting splendid colors, their mouths craving rare flavors, their noses delighting in orchids and musk, their bodies desiring softness and lightness, their minds unable to cease—how can they not obscure their own nature’s root? They merely recite with their mouths but cannot uphold it in their hearts.\n\nIn ancient times, people savored their food, wore their clothes, and delighted in their customs, neither envying the high nor despising the low. Even unto old age and death, they did not visit one another, each without attachment to others. Without cultivation, the Dao naturally manifested. Now, those who practice meditation all say one must not cling to images or forms, for even the slightest attachment is an error. This is true, yet they know not where to begin.\n\nAmong the Daoist scriptures, the *Scripture of Inner Observation*, the *Scripture of Concentration and Observation*, the *Scripture of Purity*, the *Scripture of Disaster Dispelling*, and the *Treatise on Sitting in Forgetfulness*—these texts speak most clearly, yet people still grope uncertainly. How much less can they grasp other scattered teachings? Only this *True Scripture of the Northern Dipper for Prolonging Life* serves as the root of nature and appearance, the convenient gateway to great concentration. If one can rely on this scripture and uphold its practices, the source of concentration becomes evident. When one reaches the state of no thought, no entanglement, and no attachment, one knows the inconceivable merit of this scripture.\n\nWhen karmic transgressions entangle the soul, binding it to the netherworld, and suffering is complete, one departs from the human realm, reborn among beasts or as birds and insects, turning away from the human path and making it difficult to regain a human body. Sinking thus, unaware and unenlightened, one suffers this cycle of rebirth due to past lives’ delusion of the true nature.\n\nKarmic transgressions arise from the ten evils, all originating from the three karmas: bodily karma includes three—killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct; verbal karma includes four—false speech, frivolous speech, divisive speech, and harsh speech; mental karma includes three—greed, hatred, and delusion. \"Entanglement\" means being tied and bound, for people fail to discern the root of nature and appearance or awaken to the gateway of transcendence. Adrift on the river of desire, blown by the winds of the sea of craving, they are entangled and bound by karmic transgressions, unable to attain liberation. Thus, the netherworld detains them, and their yang souls endure myriad sufferings until their time is fulfilled. Then, barred from the human realm, they fall into the destinies of beasts, birds, and insects, turning ever more perverse, unable to return to the human path or regain a human body. Sinking thus, unaware and unenlightened, they suffer this cycle of karmic retribution due to past lives’ delusion of their true nature.\n\nWith a heart of compassion, the Lord manifests transformations to teach and convert. Lord Lao, pitying sentient beings, manifests transformations and descends to expound the scriptural teachings and awaken the deluded.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Great Mystery* states: The Nine Heavenly Thearchs each array their immortal retinues, welcoming Lord Lao in the various Grand Clarity Palaces and inviting him to each of the nine heavens to lecture on the ninefold Way of the Central Yellow. Solemnly enthroned in the Palace of the Grand Ultimate, his countless transformation bodies teach in all directions, responding to conditions and assuming titles to universally save heaven and humanity. Thus, he descends daily, serving as the imperial teacher of successive dynasties.\n\nAs for Shu’s capital, the earth spirits surged forth...",

      "translated_text": "In the Western Shu region, its territory lies within Chengdu Prefecture. The *Scripture of the Opening of Heaven* states: Beneath the World of the Limitless, there exists another realm, where the Nine Ramparts and Thirty-Six Earth Sovereigns are arrayed. Below the Nine Ramparts, the qi of the Windy Marsh resembles wind yet is not wind, resembles water yet is not water—its nature is dim and suffering, indistinguishable. It upholds the earthly wheel, preventing it from tilting. Above the Windy Marsh, within the Nine Ramparts, the earth spirits reside. Heaven is exalted, earth is humble; when the Most High descends, the earth spirits emerge to support his feet—such is the proper ritual. They raised a jade platform to serve as a high seat.\n\nThereupon, Lord Lao ascended the jade platform and bestowed upon the Heavenly Master the *True Essentials of the Northern Dipper’s Original Destiny*. The Heavenly Master’s surname was Zhang, a native of Pei’s Fengyi County, the eighth-generation descendant of Zhang Liang, the Marquis of Liu. During the Han dynasty, his original name was Ling; after entering the Dao, he added the character *Dao* to his name. Daoist scriptures all record: \"Daoling, styled Hanfu.\" Now, to avoid the taboo of Daoling’s name, he is referred to by his style, \"True Man.\" The Heavenly Master traveled with Lord Lao to Chengdu, arriving at the site where the Jade Maiden of Great Fuxi refined the Great Elixir. There, the earth spirits raised a jade platform, over a *zhang* in height. Lord Lao ascended the platform, while the Heavenly Master bowed at its base. At that moment, Lord Lao expounded the method of the Northern Dipper for prolonging life and eradicating death, transmitting it to the Heavenly Master. The site lies over one *li* to the left of Chengdu Prefecture’s southern gate. Today, the Jade Platform Abbey remains, along with the four stone legs of the platform. The Heavenly Master established his governance there, making it the twenty-third of his administrative seats.\n\nThis is the scripture; the *jue* are the methods. There are also the *Mysterious Numinous Scripture’s Essentials*, which employ methods to enact the scripture’s affairs. Broadly propagating these essential methods universally saves sentient beings. The Most High, in his vast compassion, reveals the secret and essential scriptural methods to universally deliver and cross over all beings, regardless of wisdom or foolishness, enabling them to comprehend, awaken, and cultivate, thereby beholding the true and authentic Dao.\n\nAt that time, Lord Lao addressed the Heavenly Master, saying: \"The human body is difficult to obtain. The *Scripture of the Chapters on Generating the Spirit* states: When a person receives life within the womb, the Three Primes nurture and cultivate it. The primordial qi binds the form, and after nine months, the spirits are arrayed. When the qi is full, the voice emerges, and though the voice is yet nascent, the spirits are complete. The Nine Heavens rejoice, the Great Unity holds the tally, the Thearchs confer ranks, the Directors of Destinies record the register, the Controllers of Life determine the allotment, the Five Thearchs oversee birth, and the Holy Mother guards the chamber. Heavenly spirits, earthly deities, and the Three Realms all stand guard. The Nine Celestial Marshals stand in the courtyard, facing east, reciting the *Nine Heavens’ Precious Chapters on Generating the Spirit* nine times. If the child is male, the myriad spirits chant 'reverence'; if female, they chant 'submission.' If male, the Controller of Life respectfully assents; if female, it respectfully complies. Only then is the child born. If the Nine Great Marshals do not issue the life tally, and the myriad spirits do not chant 'reverence' or 'assent,' birth does not occur.\n\nWhen a person is reborn into the human realm, their form is bathed in the Great Yang, startling heaven and earth. Such nobility is scarcely surpassable. Heavenly perfected ones, earthly spirits, and the Three Realms all attend—this is not a trifling matter. At the moment of birth, it is not to be deemed base. Thus, the human body is truly difficult to obtain. The ancient worthies offered a metaphor: Scatter mustard seeds atop Mount Kunlun, then hold a needle below to catch them—only those that meet the needle obtain a human body. Those that fall are innumerable. Such is the difficulty of obtaining it.\n\nThe Middle Land is hard to be born into. The Middle Land is the blessed land of the Central Kingdom, the most noble realm among humans and heavens. Yet with shallow karmic blessings, it is difficult to be born here. Even if one is born here, the true Dharma is hard to encounter. Many are deluded regarding the authentic Dao and enter heterodox sects. As the Perfected Lord Yin stated: 'A righteous person expounding heterodox teachings—those heterodox teachings all return to rectitude. A heterodox person expounding the true Dharma—the true Dharma also returns to heterodoxy.' There is no heterodoxy or orthodoxy in the Dharma; the Dao is not dual. Yet people harbor heterodox minds, giving rise to confusion and chaos, unable to discern for themselves. Thus, the true Dharma is hard to encounter.\n\nMany plant the roots of transgression, indulge in cunning deceit, give free rein to lust and killing, delight in worldly passions, yield to greed and wrath, sink into hell, and lose their human form. The six senses cannot be purified, and all transgressions arise therefrom. Cunning deceit includes embellished speech, double-tongued words, and falsehoods—people often act wantonly without restraint. Lust and killing involve lewdness and taking life—people often indulge without moderation or precepts. Worldly passions are manifold—people delight in them without restraint. Greed, love, and wrath—people often indulge without control. After the body perishes, they sink into hell, enduring myriad sufferings, and cannot regain a human form. For such reasons, sentient beings fail to awaken and do not know the true Dao, and those who are deluded are many.\n\nGiven these circumstances, sentient beings cannot awaken to the true Dao, and thus the deluded are exceedingly numerous. Now, I pity and behold these sentient beings, and therefore bestow the teachings and expound good causes, enabling them to know the Dao, understand that body, nature, and life all depend on the Dao for their existence, and comprehend these conditions. Thus, they may abide long in the human realm, their lineage unbroken, and be human life after life.\"\n\nLord Lao, pitying sentient beings, expounded the scriptural *jue* and good causes to enable their awakening to the Dao. The *Scripture of Inner Observation* states: \"From the moment one receives form, it is called *nature*; from the Dao one receives life, it is called *destiny*. Human nature and life both arise from the Dao. Those who know the Dao and practice it are like sowing seeds in spring—autumn will bring a harvest, and spring will return. Sowing again in spring, life is obtained anew. All life arises from this Dao.\"\n\nDo not be born in a land without the Dao. A ruler with the Dao cherishes the people as his own children; a ruler without the Dao regards the people as grass or mustard seeds. Such were the rulers Jie of Xia, Zhou of Shang, the First Emperor of Qin, and Yang of Sui, as well as the eras of Jin and Wei, when chaos followed chaos. To be born a person in such times—how could it be considered fortunate? To be born in a land with the Dao—is this not the greatest good?\"",

      "translated_text": "\"Do not sever humanity’s root. Once this Dao is awakened, one will be human life after life, the root unbroken. Further cultivating the heart in the true Dao, one gradually enters the immortal lineage, forever escaping the cycle of rebirth and ascending to attain the Dao. The Dao resides in the heart—guard it without loss, and gradual attainment will follow. Human cultivation and learning proceed by degrees, hence the *Gradual Hexagram*. As Laozi said: ‘A tree of arm-spanning girth begins as a tiny sprout; a journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.’ The only danger is knowing the Dao yet failing to practice it—those who practice will surely reach it. By cultivating the true Dao step by step, one may escape the cycle of rebirth and attain the Dao.\n\nThus, I reveal to you this wondrous method to deliver the people of heaven and guide them to return to truth and know their destiny. Lord Lao bestowed upon the Heavenly Master the most profound scriptural instructions, awakening those of lesser understanding to return to the true Dao and comprehend their original destiny. On the day of one’s *benming* (original destiny), one should perform purification rites and set up an offering altar, invoking the Northern Dipper. The *benming* is called the *Small Gathering Assembly*, when the spirits within the body all assemble in the *Original Palace* to assess merits and transgressions. Every cycle of sixty days, as the scriptures say: ‘Six times each year, the descent occurs among humankind.’ On such days, it is fitting to perform purification rites and offerings, invoking the Dipper Stars to repent sins, dispel calamities, prolong life, and pray for blessings.\n\nThe Three Officials:\nThe Heavenly Official of the Upper Prime bestows blessings,\nThe Earthly Official of the Middle Prime pardons sins,\nThe Water Official of the Lower Prime resolves misfortunes.\n\nThe Seven Primes are governed by the Three Primes, which are also the convergence of the Three Destinies.\n\nThe Five Emperors:\nThe Azure Emperor governs Wood,\nThe Vermilion Emperor governs Fire,\nThe White Emperor governs Metal,\nThe Black Emperor governs Water,\nThe Yellow Emperor governs Earth.\nHumans receive form through the Five Phases, and the Five Emperors are involved in all things.\n\nThe Nine Bureaus:\nThe Upper Prime has Three Officials and Nine Bureaus,\nThe Middle Prime has Three Officials and Nine Bureaus,\nThe Lower Prime has Three Officials and Nine Bureaus,\nTogether forming Nine Officials and Twenty-Seven Bureaus.\nThe Upper Prime has thirty-six departments,\nThe Middle and Lower Primes each have forty-two departments,\nTotaling one hundred and twenty departments.\nThey govern all beings—celestial and terrestrial, spirits, immortals, ghosts, and the myriad creatures—all are overseen by the Dipper Officials, connecting inner and outer duties without the slightest error.\n\nThe Four Offices:\nThe Heavenly Offices are the Offices of Destiny, Records, Wrongs, and Perils.\nThe Earthly Offices are the Offices of Destiny, Records, Merit, and Shared Retribution.\n\nTo pray for blessings and dispel calamities, one presents petitions with sincere wishes. All entreaties should be expressed in written petitions, fully conveying one’s intent. Matters should be truthfully reported, and the language need not be ornate—this can eliminate misfortunes and invoke blessings. Offerings should be made with utmost reverence: various incense and flowers, seasonal fresh fruits (the first fruits of the season are called *offerings of the new*), and the five fruits—peach, plum, jujube, chestnut, and apricot—should be presented with sincerity.\n\nAdapt to the rituals of the world:\nThe rituals of the world include advancing and retreating, bowing and rising, approaching the altar, praising and worshiping, celebratory rites, offering flowers, pouring water, serving jujube soup and fine tea. These are the world’s rituals, varying by rank. The highest are for kings, dukes, and great officials; next for the wealthy and elders; then for the middle class; and last for the poor. Each should measure their means and present offerings with sincerity. Even in worldly gatherings among relatives and friends, each adapts to the appropriate rituals. At such times, the noble and wealthy display lavish spreads, while the middle class prepares modest offerings. If even human affairs are treated with such care, how can one be careless when invoking the celestial perfected?\n\nGold and silver paper money and paper horses are also part of worldly rituals. The Heavenly Master said: ‘In the most ancient times, there was no money; in the middle era, it began to be used. Burning paper money and paper horses follows worldly custom.’ When heaven and earth first separated, there were already celestial money stars governing such matters. As times change, the stars respond to the occasion, aligning with the Dao and harmonizing yin and yang. If one uses the ancient *Hetu* method to perform Dipper rites, the rituals differ from worldly practices.\n\nEstablish a pure altar, modeling heaven and earth:\nA pure dwelling should be round like heaven and square like earth—this is the design of the altar, round within and square without. Whether in a temple or at home, one should act according to their capacity to perform rituals. Even those without means should maintain a sincere heart; those with means who are stingy do not truly act according to their capacity. The merit and virtue are profound and cannot be fully described.\"",

      "translated_text": "Reciting the sacred names of the Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolves transgressions, washes away calamities and misfortunes, augments life with fortune and longevity, and brings virtuous rewards to the self. In times of urgent distress, one may burn incense and recite scriptures to secure timely peace and safety. With wholehearted devotion, invoking the sacred titles of the Northern Dipper dissolves transgressions as they arise, cleanses calamities and misfortunes, strengthens life with fortune and longevity, and bestows virtuous rewards upon the self. In moments of dire peril, burning incense and reciting the names brings swift response and immediate tranquility.\n\nThus is proclaimed the efficacy of the Great Sage Northern Dipper in resolving adversities:\n\nThose who uphold these scriptural precepts may dissolve all hardships, as attested by such verifications, and should perform rites of expiation accordingly.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Three Calamities.\nThe Three Calamities are stellar in nature, and when they coincide with one’s year of fate, they constitute the gravest of disasters. In the Dipper-appeal method, some place the Three Calamity Stars before the Dipper’s mouth for veneration, for these stars preside over the foremost of all adversities. For example:\n- Those born in the years of *yin*, *wu*, or *xu* encounter these stars in the years of *shen*, *you*, or *xu*, where the Human Star, Heavenly Misfortune Star, and Earthly Calamity Star form the Three Calamities.\n- Those born in the years of *shen*, *zi*, or *chen* encounter them in the years of *yin*, *mao*, or *chen*, where the Heavenly Worm Star, Heavenly Punishment Star, and Heavenly Comet Star form the Three Calamities.\n- Those born in the years of *si*, *you*, or *chou* encounter them in the years of *hai*, *zi*, or *chou*, where the Earthly Ruin Star, Earthly Perishing Star, and Earthly Punishment Star form the Three Calamities.\n- Those born in the years of *hai*, *mao*, or *wei* encounter them in the years of *si*, *wu*, or *wei*, where the Black Evil Star, Yin Conspiracy Star, and White Slayer Star form the Three Calamities.\nWhen these stars align with one’s fate, bringing adversity within three years, one should preemptively dissolve them to secure blessings.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Four Slayer Calamities.\nThe Year Slayer, Month Slayer, Day Slayer, and Hour Slayer constitute the Four Slayers. When they coincide with the years and months of *yin-shen*, *si-hai*, *chen-xu*, *chou-wei*, *zi-wu*, or *mao-you*, and fully clash with one’s Four Pillars, they are called the Four Slayers. If afflicted, the calamity is severe, and one should preemptively perform rites of expiation.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Five Phase Calamities.\nMetal restrains Wood, Wood restrains Earth, Earth restrains Water, Water restrains Fire, and Fire restrains Metal. When the Five Phases in a person’s fate are discordant and mutually restraining, calamities arise, and one should preemptively dissolve them.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Six Harm Calamities.\n*Zi* harms *wei*, *wei* harms *zi*; *chou* harms *wu*, *wu* harms *chou*; *yin* harms *si*, *si* harms *yin*; *chen* harms *mao*, *mao* harms *chen*; *shen* harms *hai*, *hai* harms *shen*; *you* harms *xu*, *xu* harms *you*—when these pairs meet in mutual opposition, they form the Six Harms. The *Book of Fate* states: \"When the Six Harms converge, sorrow abounds and joy is scarce,\" and one should perform rites of expiation.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Seven Injury Calamities.\nThe Robber Slayer, Calamity Slayer, Heavenly Slayer, Earthly Slayer, Year Slayer, Month Slayer, and Perishing Spirit constitute the Seven Injuries, corresponding to the essences of the Seven Stars. If one encounters them, how could there be no disaster? One should swiftly appeal for dissolution.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Eight Difficulties.\nA person’s fate is divided into Three Origins: the Heavenly Origin by the heavenly stem, the Earthly Origin by the earthly branch, and the Human Origin by the tonal phase, which together align with the Five Positions. When these Eight Matters proceed harmoniously, they bring fortune; when they reverse, they bring misfortune. If they coincide with one’s year, month, or fate, calamity is certain, and when circumstances press urgently, one should perform rites of expiation to dissolve them.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Nine Star Calamities.\nThe Nine Stars are: (1) Rāhu, (2) Earthly Mansion, (3) Water Star, (4) Metal Star, (5) Great Sun, (6) Fire Star, (7) Ketu, (8) Great Yin, and (9) Wood Star. Their configurations are also governed by the Dipper Palace. When they align with one’s year of fate, their auspiciousness or inauspiciousness is determined by the strength of their palace positions. If they portend misfortune, one should appeal to the Dipper Palace for expiation.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Marital Calamities.\nThe union of husband and wife follows the Dao of yin and yang, and should be assessed and harmonized before consummation—this is the method of the ancient sages. Yet vulgar customs sometimes propagate the notion of \"heavenly marriage,\" disregarding such assessments, leading to disharmony between yin and yang and manifold misfortunes. For instance, the Lonely Hour, Widowed Mansion, Yin Slayer, Yang Slayer, Front Five, Rear Five, Slayer of Yang, Slayer of Yin, Slayer of Husband, Slayer of Wife, Cut-off Chamber, and Lonely Phoenix all have clear precedents. If severely afflicted, one may take three or nine wives, or three or five husbands, and many remain lifelong in empty chambers. Even when such encounters occur, rites of expiation may be performed.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Calamities of Sons and Daughters.\nThe causes of such calamities are manifold, arising from the fates of husband and wife, the misfortune summoned by ancestral graves, or the depletion of hidden virtue, leading to barrenness. If the calamity stems from fate or graves, it may be dissolved through expiation. If it arises from lost hidden virtue, one should swiftly atone to the Dipper Palace, perform meritorious deeds, and cultivate virtue to plant the seed of descendants—without this, it cannot be resolved.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Calamities of Childbirth.\nIf a woman’s fate is afflicted by the Three Punishments, Metal Slayer, or the spirits of flowing blood and blood corpses, these may be dissolved. If she harbors jealousy or grievances, she should swiftly appeal to the Dipper Palace, daily renew her virtue, and avert calamity.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Calamities of Recurring Afflictions.\nThe disease of transmitted corpses, also called corpse infestation, flows unceasingly and may extinguish a household. It is also termed tomb litigation or summons of retribution. One should swiftly cultivate goodness and dissolve it according to the method.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Calamities of Epidemics.\nThe *qi* of pestilential jaundice and seasonal epidemics arises when one fails to nurture the spiritual root, indulges in pungent and taboo foods, acts without righteousness or benevolence, disrupts the harmony of the six relations, neglects incense offerings, and loses the protection of deities and spirits. This causes households to suffer epidemics, bodies to contract toxic *qi*, illnesses to afflict young and old, and deaths among the populace. If the transgression is grave, the lineage may be cut off. Such calamities, called \"heavenly movements,\" issue from the Heavenly Court. When one or two are infected, one should urgently perform rites of expiation to dissolve them.",

At such times, one’s very life may be imperiled—one must swiftly appeal to the Northern Dipper, invoking its sacred names, and the peril shall be dispelled in that very moment.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Calamity of Cangues and Cudgels.\nThe *Celestial Statutes* state: Those long confined in prison suffer the calamity of cangues and cudgels; if one’s grievances remain unredressed due to wrongful oppression, one may petition the city god of one’s jurisdiction, entrusting the investigation to officials. Let their minds be enlightened, swiftly resolving the matter. When ritual masters perform this rite, its efficacy is manifest—how much more so when one supplicates the Lords of the Dipper.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Calamity of Unnatural Death.\nThis category encompasses a thousand instances, impossible to enumerate in full; all deaths that do not come naturally are called unnatural. If one suspects such a fate, one must perform rites of expiation in advance, and the response shall surely be felt. Yet if one willfully violates the laws of yin and yang, can such a calamity be dissolved?\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Calamity of Curses and Oaths.\nThis calamity, too, has many forms. The *Celestial Statutes* decree: Ghosts and spirits not of official rank may not accept human curses. For those who are not enlightened great spirits lack the wisdom to discern truth from falsehood; they merely believe slanderous curses, wrongly seize souls, and cause people to become deranged, mute, or bedridden for long periods—all of which may be dissolved through supplication.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Calamity of the Celestial Net.\nThe hours of *xu* and *hai* (19:00–23:00) are the two limits of the Celestial Net in a person’s fate and *qi*. When one encounters this, one may suffer the calamity of celestial imprisonment—it is fitting to dissolve it in advance.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Calamity of the Earthly Net.\nThe hours of *chen* and *si* (7:00–11:00) are the two limits of the Earthly Net in a person’s fate and *qi*. When one encounters this, one may suffer the calamity of imprisonment in prefectural or county jails—it is fitting to perform rites of expiation in advance. Moreover, when the Year Star aligns with the Three Lives and Four Pillars of one’s destiny, this is called \"obscured *qi*,\" which also brings the calamity of nets and snares.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Calamity of Blade and Warfare.\nThe calamity of blade and warfare is determined by fate. Yet if one devoutly reveres the true Lords of the Dipper, one shall naturally pass through these tribulations.\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords dissolve the Calamity of Water and Fire.\nWhen floods overflow and conflagrations rage, their cruelty is extreme. Yet under the protection of the true Lords of the Dipper, one shall be spared from fate’s reckoning in such disasters.\n\nThus, the Seven Primordial Lords, the Great Sages, are profoundly efficacious in spirit, delivering beings from all calamities and hardships, lifting suffering multitudes from their torments. If one makes urgent supplication, reciting the protective incantations, one shall attain peace and safety, generating a hundred blessings that harmonize with the Five Phases.\n\nThe Five Phases refer to the human body: the lungs correspond to Metal, the liver to Wood, the kidneys to Water, the heart to Fire, and the spleen to Earth. The Lords of the Northern Dipper, attuned to this mysterious power, deliver beings from all calamities and hardships, lifting suffering multitudes from their torments. If one makes urgent supplication and recites the incantations, generating a hundred blessings in accord with the Five Phases, then the five viscera shall be at peace.\n\nThe Three Hun-Souls shall be secure and robust,\nThe Great Mystery nurtures the hun-souls and generates *qi*, fostering inner well-being.",

The reason the human spirit remains pure is the absence of defilement. Defilement arises from distraction and disorder; settle and still it, and existence after existence the spirit stays clear. When the body is free and the spirit clear, the Dao is naturally attained.\n\nGoodness resembles a reflection in light, response echoes a sound in a valley. As a mirror reflects form, beauty and ugliness distinguish themselves; as sound answers echo, good and evil leave no discrepancy. In terms of the Dao, an empty heart is like a valley, a luminous heart like a mirror. When the heart is empty, the Dao descends; when the Dao descends, the heart opens; when the heart opens, clarity dawns.\n\nThough there is seeing, one must not grasp what is seen; though there is hearing, one must not cling to what is heard. This is what is meant by \"looking yet not seeing, listening yet not hearing.\" Withdraw vision and return hearing to perfect stillness, and realize the Dao of emptiness. Though one speaks of realizing the Dao, in truth there is nothing to realize.

      "translated_text": "The Lord Lao says: The Northern Apex suspends its celestial image, and all stars pay homage to it. The Northern Apex is the Northern Thearch; the Emperor Star within the Dipper serves as the stellar sovereign, presiding in solemn dignity over the celestial patterns. As the *Analects* states: \"Like the Northern Apex, it abides in its place, and all stars pay homage to it.\" One variant reads \"the Northern Apex above,\" which is incorrect.\n\nIt is the pivot of creation and transformation. The Dipper’s handle and pole occupy the Thearch’s abode, governing the revolutions of the four seasons and overseeing the transformations of generation and completion. In the first, second, and third months, the Dipper’s handle points to the positions of *yin*, *mao*, and *chen*, generating and transforming the myriad things. In the fourth, fifth, and sixth months, it points to *si*, *wu*, and *wei*, nurturing and fostering the myriad things. In the seventh, eighth, and ninth months, it points to *shen*, *you*, and *xu*, ripening and maturing the myriad things. In the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth months, it points to *hai*, *zi*, and *chou*, gathering and storing the myriad things. If the Dipper’s handle does not revolve, the four seasons lose their rhythm, the Five Phases fail to respond, cold and heat deviate from their measures, yin and yang fall out of harmony, and the myriad things cannot reach completion. Thus, it is the pivot of creation and transformation.\n\nIt serves as the sovereign of human spirits, proclaiming its majesty across the Three Realms and governing the myriad numina. The Dipper is the lord of human spirits, issuing its commands and governing the myriad numina within the Three Realms. One variant reads \"proclaiming majesty through statutes and precepts,\" which is incorrect.\n\nIt determines the appointed times of good and evil for humanity. There are those in the world who devote themselves to good deeds yet suffer many calamities—this is because their merit in goodness is not yet sufficient. Once their merit is complete, great fortune will arrive. There are those who commit evil deeds yet enjoy fortune—this is because their evil is not yet full. Once their evil is complete, great misfortune will befall them. The reason good and evil each have their appointed times is that the Supreme possesses the virtue of cherishing life. For those who do good, it awaits the fullness of their great goodness; for those who do evil, it awaits their repentance. Thus, the appointed times of good and evil become clear. If one initially pursues goodness but, due to demonic obstacles, later awakens to repentance, their merit in goodness diminishes daily while their name is added to the ledger of evil. If one begins with minor evils and, seeing no misfortune, grows accustomed to them, their sins gradually increase while their name is erased from the ledger of good. Therefore, one must not fail to guard against minor evils, nor neglect minor acts of goodness. Do not fear correcting mistakes; correction must be swift. The heart of repentance should arise within the allotted time. If one exceeds the limit, death will draw near, and even after ten thousand kalpas and a thousand rebirths, though one may repent, what can be recovered?\n\nIt oversees the records of right and wrong in the Nether Bureau. To \"oversee\" is to administer; it administers the records of right and wrong in the Nether Bureau, clarifying what is right and discerning what is wrong—this is the foundation of wisdom. If even a noble person governing the people must thoroughly understand this matter, how much more so the lofty perfected and sagely philosophers? One variant reads \"to hook the Nether Bureau,\" which is incorrect.\n\nThe Five Phases share a common endowment, and the Seven Governors belong to the same category. Jupiter pertains to Wood, and the four lodges—*Jiao*, *Dou*, *Kui*, and *Jing*—share its category. Mars pertains to Fire, and the four lodges—*Wei*, *Shi*, *Zi*, and *Yi*—share its category. Venus pertains to Metal, and the four lodges—*Kang*, *Niu*, *Lou*, and *Gui*—share its category. Mercury pertains to Water, and the four lodges—*Ji*, *Bi*, *Shen*, and *Zhen*—share its category. Saturn pertains to Earth, and the four lodges—*Di*, *Nü*, *Wei*, and *Liu*—share its category. The four lodges—*Fang*, *Mao*, *Yi*, and *Xing*—are called the Solar Lodges, the abodes of the Great Yang, and are matched to Fire. The four lodges—*Xin*, *Wei*, *Bi*, and *Zhang*—are called the Lunar Lodges, the abodes of the Great Yin, and are matched to Water. These four times seven stars, together with the Five Phases and the Two Luminaries, are called the Seven Governors, all of which share the same category as the Northern Dipper. Only the Dipper’s pole governs the qi of the central heavens, revolving and regulating the celestial motions, presiding over the four directions, establishing the four seasons, harmonizing the Five Phases, and rectifying the celestial constants.\n\nIt is divided thus: *Tanlang* governs Heaven, *Jumen* governs Earth, *Lucun* governs Fire, *Wenqu* governs Water, *Kangzhen* governs Earth, *Wuqu* governs Wood, and *Pojun* governs Metal. Furthermore, *Tanlang* pertains to Water, *Jumen* and its left auxiliary pertain to Earth, *Lucun*, *Wenqu*, and *Lianzhen* pertain to Wood, *Wuqu* and *Pojun* pertain to Metal, and the *Bixing* pertains to Fire. The statutes state: \"The Nine Apexes are the origin of Brahmanic qi; the Seven Governors are the fundamental net of the primal.\" This is what it means.\n\nIt possesses the power to reverse death and inscribe life, and the ability to dispel calamities and deliver from adversity. The Dipper stars govern the prolongation of life, the deliverance from adversity, the protection of destiny, the augmentation of lifespan, the dissolution of calamities, the dispersion of misfortunes, and the support of the declining. Thus, they possess the power to reverse death and inscribe life, to dispel calamities and deliver from adversity.\n\nFrom the Son of Heaven to the common people, though their ranks differ, their allotment of destiny is without distinction. The *Illustrated Compendium of Correspondences* states: Emperor Ming of Han encountered the Seven Perfected of the Northern Dipper on Mount Zhongnan and asked, \"Do I still belong to the administration of the Upper Perfected?\" The Seven Perfected replied, \"Though you are the lord of men, your destiny is the same as that of the common people.\" The emperor then bowed again and sought long life, whereupon he obtained the *Mysterious Numinous Oral Instructions*. This illustrates the principle that though ranks differ, the allotment of destiny is without distinction.\n\nYet most people in the world remain deluded, unaware that their bodies belong to the Northern Dipper and their destinies are decreed by the Celestial Bureau. When calamities and afflictions arise, they do not know the gate of dissolution and gratitude; when seeking blessings and praying for life, they do not understand the path of refuge. People dwell within the web of the world, yet unable to preserve their authenticity and refine their qi, to nurture the Dao and cultivate perfection, they cannot avoid calamities befalling their bodies. Even those who study the Dao but possess shallow understanding cannot escape such afflictions. Thus, the *Scripture of Numinous Treasure* states: \"Even those of lesser learning may suffer illness and injury.\" If even Daoists cannot avoid this, how much more so the common people, who exhaust their bodies and minds in the pursuit of fame and profit, and deplete their essence and marrow in wine and lust? Morning and night, they gallop without rest, and when the time of adversity arrives, calamities will surely come.\n\nWhen calamities strike, not knowing the gate of dissolution and gratitude, they rely solely on shamans and invoke heterodox spirits. Yet shamans, being petty men, recklessly speak of misfortunes and demonic influences. In times of critical illness, they submit entirely to fate, slaughtering great offerings of the three sacrificial animals to pray for deliverance.

      "translated_text": "All such cases arise from ignorance of the gate of dissolution and gratitude. Those who know this gate begin with medicinal stones; if medicinal stones fail to cure, they next pray to their ancestors; if ancestors do not respond, they then seek talismanic methods; if talismanic methods prove ineffective, they will surely have offended Heaven, and calamity will be decreed by the stars. They must then perform jiao rites, acknowledging their own life-star lord, dissolving and warding off disaster, reflecting on transgressions and repenting of sins, and praying to the Dipper Palace—thus may they dispel misfortune, resolve calamity, and prolong life to increase their allotted years.\n\nIf one neither advances by crediting good physicians and medicinal stones for healing nor retreats by attending to ancestral rites, talismanic petitions, or jiao supplications, one remains ignorant of the path of refuge. Then calamity will deepen, illness will grow perilous, and death will draw near—how grievous this is!\n\nAll this is clearly stated in the *Baopuzi*; I dare not interpret it recklessly.\n\nThus, when the hun-soul is bound, Mount Fengdu’s Huoluo Northern Dipper Seven Primes Great Generals and the Ghostly Palace Northern Dipper Lord divide the offices of Heavenly Courts and Earthly Bureaus. Every seven years, the living are summoned to the Northern Dipper’s yin ministry to have their sins and blessings weighed. If within those seven years one has performed good deeds, one’s official salary and lifespan will be increased, and one’s name will be reported to the Heavenly Courts. If within those seven years one has committed evil, minor offenses will reduce one’s allotted years, while major sins will bring immediate death. If one’s sins are mingled with blessings or blessings with sins, or if sins are great but blessings meager while one’s allotted years remain unfulfilled and the reckoning undetermined, then during the summons the hun-soul will be bound to the yin ministry, the body will lie stricken with illness, and suffering will be endured. When the suffering is complete, one will be severed from the human realm, die, and enter the yin ministry, sinking into evil destinies—human form forever lost.\n\nThe method of summoning souls begins at one year of age for those born in the *zi* year; at two for *chou* and *hai*; at three for *yin* and *xu*; at four for *mao* and *you*; at five for *chen* and *shen*; at six for *si* and *wei*; and at seven for *wu*. Thus, those born in *zi* begin at one year, so at eight years their soul is summoned, again at fifteen, and again at twenty-two—each summons occurring every seven years. Those who begin at two are summoned at nine, sixteen, and twenty-three, and so on. All summoned souls proceed to the official bureau of their life-star.\n\nIn the year of summons, many suffer calamities. Only those who accumulate goodness may be exempt, though even they must face one summons after two or three exemptions, for the living hun-soul must be examined for merits and faults, and the *qi* assessed. The Three Officials, Nine Bureaus, Five Emperors, and Four Departments jointly oversee this matter, reviewing and determining it at each seasonal festival. If the reckoning remains unresolved, it must be re-examined until it is precise, without the slightest error.\n\nIn the year of summons, one should perform the Dao, recite scriptures, and dissolve the *qi* of examination. Further, one may suffer from the calamity of broken oaths, or the hun-soul may be bound to earth-altars, spirit-shrines, or by the curses of heterodox masters. Misfortune will then entangle one: chronic illness may not heal, or malevolent spirits may assail, causing years of debilitation, prolonged adversity. Misfortune is the calamity of cangues and rods; chronic illness, the calamity of disease; malevolent spirits, the calamity of demonic *qi*; debilitation and adversity, the calamity of the Six Harms.\n\nTomb disputes and spectral summons may implicate the recently deceased. Tombs refer to the graves of ancestors; spectral summons arise when the yin ministry’s investigations extend to the living; \"implicate\" means the deceased transmit corpse-*qi* to burden the living. Tomb disputes are manifold, with countless variations, bringing a thousand disasters and a hundred calamities, cutting off descendants, and thwarting all endeavors—all stemming from tomb disputes. There are eighty-one types of tomb disputes, large and small, corresponding to grand and modest graves, from which disputes arise.\n\nIn broad terms: during the lifetimes of one’s nine ancestors and seven generations, transgressions are many. After death, they face numerous investigations, and if descendants have not prospered, they must redeem these debts in the netherworld, where resentment and lamentation arise. Confined to the yin ministry with no means of resolution, the Heavenly Courts investigate and impose judgments, while yin officials extend these to the living. On the Three Primes and Five La days, they are brought forth for interrogation, their descendants’ names and tomb locations examined, sins recorded, and names fixed. Descendants are subtly summoned, leading to their ruin—no trifling matter.\n\nMoreover, improper yin-yang burial sites fall under the positions of the Northern Dipper’s Nine Stars, which determine celestial stars and earthly luminaries, the flow of mountains and waters, the depth of the burial site, the size of the Bright Hall, the height of the Four Symbols, and the orientation of the Five Tones—all governed by the Dipper Palace. If auspicious, peace ensues; if inauspicious, disputes arise. Burials at water sources, interments before spirit-temples, damaged tombs, broken coffins, overlapping graves, or new tombs encroaching on old—such cases number over a hundred, all constituting tomb disputes that harm the living. One must swiftly petition the Dipper Palace to seek dissolution.\n\nOr one may suffer Heaven’s reproach or false accusations from below. When one accumulates sins and commits transgressions without repentance, Heaven will send down punishment, and ghosts will seize the opportunity—this is what is meant by \"ghosts exploit the gaps of calamity and decline.\" (One version reads \"false accusations\" as incorrect.)\n\nHow to resolve such peril? One must urgently petition the Northern Dipper, perform jiao rites to thank the Perfected Lords, and recite the true scriptures, acknowledging one’s life-star lord—only then may one attain peace and prosperity.\n\nFor all who face such calamities, one must swiftly petition the Dipper Palace, acknowledge one’s life-star lord, reverently recite this scripture, and perform jiao rites with sincerity—thus may one attain peace and prosperity.",

      "translated_text": "Moreover, there are profound mysteries that cannot be fully expounded. The scripture does not exhaust the esoteric inner teachings, for their depth and subtlety defy complete articulation. Whenever one beholds the true form of the Northern Dipper, one must bow in reverence and utmost respect.\n\nThe Dao’s image is formless, manifesting through transformation—this is what is called \"the image without image, the form without form, the shape without shape.\" It cannot be sought through mere gazing, nor obtained through mere encounter. The so-called true form arises from the convergence of qi, born in accord with qi, embodying the essence of emptiness, naturally and spontaneously. Its foundation is luminous clarity, from which colors and images emerge. Thus, names are derived from forms, and designations established by images. The names that can be named arise as needed, for they are not fixed but contingent upon their use.\n\nTherefore, the true form and its names reside within my heart. Though the Dao is without mind, it may be sought through sentiment; though the Dao is without sentiment, it flickers in the indistinct. When one transcends the body and abides in it, the true form is present—this is when one should bow one’s head in reverence and cultivate a heart of utmost respect.\n\nThe first star of the Northern Dipper, Yangming, is the Great Star Lord Tanlang, governing those born in the *zi* hour.

He is also called the Great Sage of the Pivot Palace □ Star Lord, or the Supporting Perfected Lord Luoshenzi, serving in heaven. He governs the Celestial Origin, acting as the Celestial Grand Commandant, overseeing the epochs of kalpas, administering governance, and rectifying transgressions. Above, he commands the perfected of the Nine Heavens; in the middle, he oversees the flying immortals of the Five Peaks; below, he leads the perfected of later learners. All spirits of heaven and earth, and the weight of merits and faults, are subject to his authority.\n\nHe governs those born in the *zi* hour, overseeing the True Lord of the Great Yang. The four lunar lodges—Room, Wall, Straddler, and Bond—along with the terrestrial divisions of Qin and Xuzhou, fall under his domain. His nodal season is Yangming, when spring engenders the myriad beings.\n\nThe *Art of Disappearance* states: The celestial name Tianying is Zuran, with hidden names in the immortal scriptures varying by method. The star spans 920 *li*. When lit as a lamp, it is called the Body Star, its brightness or dimness serving as verification. The true talisman is called the Talisman of Prolonging Life.\n\nThe second star of the Northern Dipper, Yinjing, is the Primordial Star Lord Jumen, governing those born in the *chou* and *hai* hours. The Star Lord’s surname is Yuying, personal name Jimingguang, style Jumen. He wears a Five-Colored Flying Cloud Crown, a purple robe with a yellow skirt, a seven-colored brocade mantle, and tiger-patterned shoes.

      "translated_text": "The *Dun Jia* states: The Heavenly Penetrating Star’s style is Ziqin. When lighting lamps, one prays for blessings; affairs undertaken openly bring good fortune, while those concealed bring misfortune. ○ Furthermore, the Ninth Supreme Palace’s Imperial Transmutation Golden Stone Mountain River Dipper’s High Sovereign Right Consort is named Taiyi Di, styled Yunyu, adorned in dark green embroidered shawls and kingfisher-feathered skirts. The Nine Right Consorts all wear cloud-tousled buns. Another hidden star is called the Aligned Star, which resides beside the inner edge of the Great Gate Star.\n\nThe Upper Terrace’s Void Essence Opening Virtue Star Lord.\nThe Middle Terrace’s Sixfold Purity Controller of Emptiness Star Lord.\nThe Lower Terrace’s Crooked Life Controller of Fortune Star Lord.\n\nThe Upper Terrace Star Lord is named Void Essence, his face crimson, exhaling red *qi*, hair unbound in Daoist robes, holding a green jade tablet, riding black clouds, with yellow *qi* crowning his head.\nThe Middle Terrace Star Lord is named Sixfold Purity, also called Sixfold Pavilion, his face white, exhaling white *qi* that fills the heavens, dressed in Daoist robes, holding a white jade tablet, riding white clouds, with white *qi* crowning his head.\nThe Lower Terrace Star Lord is named Crooked Life, his face small yet radiant with a thousand beams, *qi* like threads piercing the dark, standing amid blue-green *qi*, clad in Daoist robes, holding a blue-green jade tablet.\n\nThe Three Terraces comprise six stars, shining in pairs, called the Celestial Stairway. In heaven, they are the Three Terraces; in rank, the Three Dukes; in man, the Three Hun. They array the Grand Stair to assist the Emperor’s throne.\nThe two stars of the Upper Terrace: the upper star governs emperors, the lower star governs empresses.\nThe two stars of the Middle Terrace: the upper star governs feudal lords and the Three Dukes, the lower star governs ministers and grandees.\nThe two stars of the Lower Terrace: the upper star governs scholars, the lower star governs commoners.\n\nThe Three Terraces receive the three *qi* of emptiness—luminous blue-green, yellow, and white—true colors that harmonize yin and yang. The *Southern Dipper Sutra* states: The Southern Dipper molds the *hun*; the Northern Dipper forges the *po*—this is the principle of yin and yang’s molding and forging. Yin and yang smelt and refine to generate our spirit; only after the spirit descends into the womb can life take form. The Terrace (*tai*) is the womb (*tai*); threefold and doubled, the nine *qi* are thus attained. Hence, within the golden chamber and jade hall, the embryo is nested in nine layers. Man receives his substance from yin and yang and binds his *hun* to the Three Terraces. The *hun* is yang, moving to generate life; the *po* is yin, still to stabilize. When man’s movement and stillness do not lose the harmony of yin and yang, his form is firmly secure. This is what is meant by the Three Terraces giving me life, nurturing me, and protecting me.\n\nThe Northern Dipper governs the source of water; the Southern Dipper governs the abode of fire—these two Dippers are the great agents of generation and completion. The Southern Dipper’s true yang fire is stored in *kan*; the Northern Dipper’s true one water is stored in *li*. The two *qi* ascend and descend, coming and going in union, achieving the hexagram *Jiji* (Completion). All things flourish and prosper—this is the foundation of the Dao. Water is the number one; multiplied by five, it becomes the Southern Dipper’s six stars. Fire is the number two; multiplied by five, it becomes the Northern Dipper’s seven stars. Each subtracts five to leave three—three is the number of generation, hence the Three Terraces. The stars of the Southern and Northern Dippers total thirteen; in man’s body, they correspond to thirteen matters. The Most High said: “Those who follow life are thirteen; those who follow death are thirteen.” This is the Dao. To know it and practice it is to live; to not know it and not practice it is to die. The handle of life and death lies in the power of yin and yang. The six stars of the Three Terraces represent three yin and three yang. This speaks of thirteen stars, yet the Three Terraces are not counted separately—they are within them. The Terrace stars number six, yet the Star Lords are three, for the three *qi* divide into six, called the Six *Qi*. Reunited, they become three; reunited again, the Six *Qi* are balanced, the Three Powers are at peace. Three transforms into six, six transforms into three—thus heaven and earth endure forever, without end.\n\n**True Talisman of the Three Terraces**\nThe true names and titles of these Perfected Lords cannot be heard. Whoever sees or hears them and can recite them possesses profound Daoist devotion and deep karmic affinity from past lives. To hear and recite them brings merit and power beyond measure.\n\nThe *Northern Dipper Original Destiny Sutra*, transmitted by the Thirty-Six Heavenly Star Controllers of Destiny and the Celestial Capital Protector of Life Great Heavenly Emperor, states: Long ago, when the Primordial Supreme Lord was expounding the Dao in the Jade Purity Yellow Ultimate Palace, a Perfected named Baoshang, foremost among the Heavenly Sons, stepped forward and asked: “The seven stars of the Central Heaven, majestic and resplendent, govern all luminaries, revolve the *qi* of destiny, and weigh life and death. Their awe-inspiring power is most profound. By what cause and condition do they hold this preeminent supremacy? From which kalpa did they arise, and what is the transformation of their beginning and end? I wish to hear this in detail.”\n\nThe Supreme Lord said: “Great is your question! In the distant Dragon Han kalpa, there was a king named Zhou Yu, whose sagely virtue knew no bounds. The people of his time enjoyed lifespans of eighty-four thousand great kalpas. The king had a jade consort, wise and compassionate, named the Purple Light Lady. In the kalpas of dust, she had already vowed to bear a sagely son to assist heaven and earth and aid in creation. After three thousand kalpas, she was born in this king’s era. On an early spring day, when a hundred flowers bloomed in splendor, she strolled in the rear garden and came to the Golden Lotus Flower Warm Jade Pool. There, she disrobed to bathe and suddenly felt a stirring. Nine lotus buds appeared and opened in due time, giving birth to nine sons. The two eldest were the Heavenly Sovereign Great Emperor and the Purple Tenuity Great Emperor. The seven younger sons became the Seven Stars, who, whether good or ill, transformed and guided the multitudes. After seven days and nights in the jade pool, they coalesced into radiant light and flew to the Central Ultimate, ninety million *li* from earth, where they transformed into nine great treasure palaces. The two eldest sovereigns resided in the Purple Tenuity Enclosure’s Grand Void Palace at the *Gouchen* position, wielding the floating tower, upholding the principles of primordial transformation, and serving as the lords of all stars.”",

The Dao-mind unfolds—this mind, pure in celestial principle, awakens and manifests, transcending the paths of dark delusion and penetrating the gates of the mysterious and wondrous. It departs from the byways of confusion, enters the Gate of the Inaudible and Invisible, returns to the true lineage, and attains the realm of flourishing life.\n\nTo seek and return to it is to serve the true lineage—*true* signifies no need for external pursuit, while *lineage* refers to the Lords of the Northern Dipper. To comprehend and awaken to this is to enter the realm of flourishing—*flourishing* denotes the unborn and undying, and *realm* encompasses the domains of humans and heavens, all by virtue of encountering this true scripture.\n\nOn the Three Primordials—\nthe fifteenth day of the first month of the Upper Primordial,\nthe fifteenth day of the seventh month of the Middle Primordial,\nand the fifteenth day of the tenth month of the Lower Primordial—\nthe Three Officials of the Three Primordials, who govern the hundred bureaus, ascend to the heavenly courts to present the records of human transgressions and blessings, weighing their depth and severity. They convene in the Dipper Palace, and thus one should perform the Dao, recite the scriptures, and conduct rites.\n\nOn the Eight Nodal Days—\nthe four *li* (spring, autumn, winter, summer beginnings),\nthe two solstices,\nand the two equinoxes—\nthe Eight Radiant Sovereigns and the Five Emperors descend to record human good and evil. As the nodal *qi* stirs in response to destiny, transgressions bring calamitous *qi*, while merit summons blessed *qi*; on these days, one should perform the Dao and recite the scriptures.\n\nOn the *Benming* Days—\nthe *jiazi* of one’s birth year, which recurs every sixty days—\nand on one’s Birthday—\nthe day of one’s birth, when the myriad spirits of the body gather—\none should perform the Dao and recite the scriptures to repay the grace of the stars’ illumination and the toil of one’s parents.\n\nOn the Days of the Northern Dipper’s Descent—\nthe twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth days of the first month;\nthe second, seventh, twenty-third, and twenty-sixth days of the second month;\nthe twenty-sixth day of the third month;\nthe seventeenth and twenty-seventh days of the fourth month;\nthe fifth, thirteenth, and twentieth days of the fifth month;\nthe fourth and eighth days of the sixth month;\nthe fourth and twenty-fourth days of the seventh month;\nthe third, eleventh, nineteenth, and twenty-seventh days of the eighth month;\nthe third and eighteenth days of the ninth month;\nthe tenth and twenty-sixth days of the tenth month;\nthe first, ninth, seventeenth, and twenty-fifth days of the eleventh month;\nand the twentieth day of the twelfth month.\n(For intercalary months, follow the preceding month.)\n\nThe above are the days when the Northern Dipper descends to traverse the earthly realm. Additionally, the *gengshen* and *jiazi* days, as well as the third and seventh days of each month, are also considered days of the Northern Dipper’s descent.\n\nWhen one solemnly establishes an altar, recites the scriptures, and performs the fast and offerings in accordance with the rites, the blessings are boundless. Life after life, one shall not stray from true nature nor fall into heterodox views. Those who uphold this scripture and constantly recite the honorific titles of the Seven Perfected Lords of the Primordials shall perfect their good merit and summon auspiciousness.\n\n*Solemnly* denotes reverence, caution, and meticulous order; *establishes* means to erect. The *altar* refers to the platform constructed for fasts and offerings, where one recites the scriptural texts and follows the ritual forms to perform the Dao. The power of such blessings is vast, extending universally without limit. Life after life, one turns toward truth and away from falsehood, never losing one’s true nature. When cultivation reaches this point, the empty chamber fills with light, and auspiciousness naturally arrives.\n\nThen is spoken the Incantation of the Northern Dipper:\n\nThis incantation of the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper originates from the True Rites of the Heavenly Heart. It dispels evil and cures illness, serving all purposes—truly the great incantation of the numinous texts beneath the Dipper.\n\nThe Nine Luminaries of the Northern Dipper, Great Spirits of the Central Heaven.\nThe Nine Luminaries refer to the Seven Stars and the two honored stars of the Sovereigns. The incantation includes the names of all nine, though later generations altered it to the Seven Stars, omitting the two luminaries.\n\nA note explains: In heaven, they are called *spirits*; on earth, *numina*; among humans, *ghosts*. Only humans occupy the middle realm. Those who cultivate may ascend to become immortals or descend to become numinous beings, while those who do not cultivate perish when their *qi* is exhausted, becoming ghosts. Ghosts, in turn, may transform into humans. Only humans are capable of all transformations and all penetrations.\n\nThe Northern Dipper is the honored one of the Central Heaven, the chief of the Three Spirits, and thus called the Great Spirit.\nAscending to the Golden Gates,\nThe Golden Gates of the Jade Capital are the capital of the August Emperor of the Void. The Northern Dipper serves as a minister to the Three Pure Ones and the Jade Emperor, hence it is said to ascend and pay homage.\n\nDescending to cover Kunlun,\nKunlun Mountain is the peak of the heavens, located within the Eight Seas. It stands at the center of the sky, its shape like an inverted canopy, broad above and narrow below. In three tiers, it rises to the level of the heavens, aligning with the center of the ten thousand degrees. The yellow and red paths intersect upon it, and the Three Luminaries traverse it.\n\nTo the east, it is called Kunlun; to the west, Dark Garden; to the north, Towering Wind; to the south, Accumulated Stones. A great precipice and springs lie at its northern gate. The mountain spans ten thousand *li* on each of its four sides. At its summit stand palaces of jasper blossoms and terraces of luminous jade. The Jasper Pool and Emerald Waters are where the Queen Mother of the West governs the host of perfected beings.\n\nAt the mountain’s highest peak stand five golden terraces, twelve jade towers, and nine layers of golden walls. The earth gives rise to trees of golden roots and forests of jasper branches, bearing fruits of plain blossoms. There are jasper springs and jade streams, purple phoenixes and emerald simurghs, green peaches and purple crabapples. A hundred treasures adorn it, beyond all reckoning.",

After seven days and nights in the jade pool, they coalesced into radiant light and flew to the Central Ultimate, ninety million *li* from earth, where they transformed into nine great treasure palaces.

      "translated_text": "The palaces where the Dipper and Pole Star reside each number five, each with five gates, and each gate emits fourfold radiance, blazing to illuminate ninety thousand *li*. Below, they govern the nine *qi* and eight luminaries, each presiding over a celestial region. The four *qi* give rise to life, and at their center stands the Pillar of Heaven, ascending to the Celestial Pass. They encompass the thirty-five divisions of the Upper Prime, each serving as the great life-generating pivot of the celestial mechanism—thus it is said they overspread Kunlun.\n\nThey regulate the cosmic order: the nine celestial bodies are the scions of the August Ultimate, governing the numbers of the Three and Five to harmonize the great transformations. From these transformations emerge the Five Phases, Five Affairs, Eight Governances, Five Constants, Three Powers, divination rites, myriad policies, Five Blessings, and their applications. Truly aligning with the human Dao to rectify the cosmic order—thus did Yao follow the August Heaven, and Shun align the Seven Governors.\n\nThey command and encompass Heaven and Earth, enveloping the cosmos—thus it is called \"command and control.\"\n\nThe names of the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper are: Great Culmen (Pole Star), Greedy Wolf, Giant Gate, Wealth Storage, Literary Curvature, Integrity and Chastity, Martial Curvature, and Broken Army. These are the titles of the Star Lords, inscribed upon their true forms.\n\nThe Highest Jade Emperor is the most revered star within the Dipper, residing near the first star in the Dipper’s bowl. Those who behold it attain a lifespan of six hundred years.\n\nThe Purple Tenuity Emperor Lord is the imperial star within the Dipper, also called the Grand Tenuity Emperor Lord. It lies near the fourth star in the Dipper’s bowl, and those who see it live three hundred years. These two august stars serve as the teachers of all phenomena and the focal point toward which the host of stars pay homage.\n\nThe Seven Perfected of the Northern Dipper declare: \"Our ancestral master, the Northern Culmen, through kalpas of diligent devotion—offering incense and lamps to the Three Clarities—fulfilled his merit and perfected his virtue. Ascending into the Purple Tenuity, he comes and goes with a canopy of blossoms following, his starlight ever resplendent with the seven treasures, shining upward to the heavens and downward to the ten thousand lands. On the third and twenty-seventh days of each month, he descends to inspect the good and evil of humankind.\"\n\nIn former times, Guo Ziyi, Prince of Fenyang, encountered an immortal who taught him the method of observing the stars. He was told: \"On the third and twenty-seventh nights of each month, in the stillness of night, let no one know. Secretly descend to the central courtyard and gaze upon the Dipper. If you see two stars whose radiance is as vast as a chariot wheel, these are the two august imperial stars. Do not speak of this to others, and you may attain longevity.\" Guo Ziyi, preoccupied with state affairs, did not practice this, but his maidservant, Huanche Jie, who attended him in his chamber, secretly read these words in his pillow book. She practiced in secret and succeeded in beholding them. Even in the Song dynasty, she remained within the palace. Today, the days when the Northern Culmen descends originate from this.\n\nThe great expanse of the celestial realm extends even to the finest mote of dust. The *qi* of yin and yang, vast as the turning heavens or minute as a speck of dust—what do they not reach? What calamity do they not extinguish? What blessing do they not bring to fruition? \"To fruition\" means to arrive and to gather. All misfortunes and disasters are entirely dissolved, and all auspicious fortunes naturally converge—this is what is meant by \"calamities and obstacles cannot intrude, all depending on the generation of a hundred blessings.\"\n\nThe primordial and august *qi* comes to merge with my body. The *Jue of Absorbing the Primordial August Qi* states: \"Azure, black, yellow, red, white, green, crimson, jade-green, and profound light—from one to nine, absorb the *qi* and consume the primordial yellow. Daily, unite with the august *qi*. The seven orifices generate radiant blossoms. After nine years, merit and practice are fulfilled, and one enters to serve in the Nine Morning Chambers.\"\n\nThe method states: The primordial yellow and august *qi* are the true *qi* of the Eight Trigrams and Nine Palaces, descending from the Nine August Ones to generate the ten thousand existences.\n\nThe First, Yang Brightness: the divine person exhales the light of azure *qi*.\nThe Second, Yin Essence: the divine person exhales the light of black *qi*.\nThe Third, Perfected Person: the divine person exhales the light of yellow *qi*.\nThe Fourth, Profound Darkness: the divine person exhales the light of red *qi*.\nThe Fifth, Cinnabar Prime: the divine person exhales the light of white *qi*.\nThe Sixth, Northern Culmen: the divine person exhales the light of green *qi*.\nThe Seventh, Heavenly Impulse: the divine person exhales the light of crimson *qi*.\nThe Eighth, Assistant Star: the divine person exhales the light of jade-green *qi*.\nThe Ninth, Adjuvant Star: the divine person exhales the light of profound *qi*.\n\nThe method of absorbing *qi* is as follows: During the first, fourth, seventh, and tenth months—the four *meng* months—practice at dawn on the first nine days of the first decade. During the second, fifth, eighth, and eleventh months—the four *zhong* months—practice at noon on the nineteenth day of the middle decade. During the third, sixth, ninth, and twelfth months—the four *ji* months—practice at midnight on the twenty-ninth day of the last decade. Perform this thrice monthly—at dawn, noon, and midnight—adjusting according to the *meng*, *zhong*, and *ji* months. Over a year, this amounts to thirty-six sessions, corresponding to the three hundred sixty degrees of the celestial sphere, with five as the surplus to complete the *qi*.\n\nOn the days and hours of practice, enter a purified chamber, burn incense, and concentrate the mind. Close the eyes, hold the breath, and click the teeth nine times. Visualize the divine lords of the Nine Palaces and star mansions seated in majesty, surrounded by an awe-inspiring retinue. Silently recite the incantation: *\"The great divine of the Northern Dipper’s primordial epoch in the center of heaven arrives... [missing characters]... august emperor, swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!\"*\n\nThen see the nine *qi* descending from the stars and flowing into the mouth. With each breath, exhale the old *qi* and gradually inhale the new *qi*, ensuring no sound reaches the ears. Swallow the nine-colored *qi* completely, click the teeth nine times, and suddenly forget all. Body and spirit unite in subtlety. Whether sitting, lying, moving, or resting, maintain harmonious adjustment. Practicing thus for nine years, the Nine Star Lords will descend to bestow upon you their secrets. You will become a long-lived immortal, ascend to the Three Heavens, befriend the host of perfected beings, and merge with the Dao in truth.\n\nThe handle of the Dipper points ceaselessly, day and night revolving. The Dipper’s handle in the heavens turns without error, moving from *zi* to *hai*, shifting one position each watch. As the poem says, \"All day long, the seven attendants\"—this is it.\n\nAnnotation: Each month, it constantly adds to *xu*; at all times, Broken Army is visible. To receive the true *qi*, one should face this direction.",

      "translated_text": "The Lord Lao declares: For all people, their nature, life, and five bodies are entirely governed by the star officials of their original destiny. \"Nature\" refers to the celestial mandate of one's nature; \"life\" means that which transforms yet remains unchanging; \"five bodies\" are the two hands, two feet, and head. The \"star officials of original destiny\" denote the star officials corresponding to the sixty *jiazi* cyclical years. Whatever Heaven bestows and humanity receives is all under the governance of these star officials of original destiny, without the slightest deviation.\n\nThe divine generals of one’s original destiny—these refer to the celestial stems and branches of one’s birth year, month, day, and hour, as well as the year, month, day, and hour of gestation, collectively termed \"fetal birth.\" They comprise the eight divine generals: the *yin-yang*, male-female, reverse-sequential, and fate-bound generals, along with the generals of *lu* (禄) and *ma* (马) *qi*, the attendant officials of original destiny, the talismanic spirits, and the scribal deities.\n\nThe star officials of one’s original constellation—these are the twenty-eight stellar sovereigns of the lunar lodges. There are two types of original constellation stars: first, the star sovereign presiding over the year of one’s birth. For instance, in the *jiazi* year, the Horn Lodge governs the year, making the Horn Lodge’s Celestial Gate Star Sovereign the star official of one’s original constellation. The second type is determined by the \"fowl divination\" method to fix the star of fetal breath and life, with three positions governing the three *yuan* (元) and three fate-bound periods—also termed the star officials of one’s original constellation. They perpetually bestow hidden protection, sustaining human life to preserve one’s celestial years. The span of celestial years is one hundred and twenty years. Those who uphold the Dao of the *Beidou Scripture for Extending Life* will find their divine generals of original destiny and star officials of their original constellation constantly shielding them, governing their life to fulfill their allotted years. Yet the common folk, lacking understanding, remain oblivious throughout their lives. The impure substance of the womb, devoid of awareness, never comprehends this principle.\n\nThe true officials of original destiny descend to the mortal realm six times each year, and the day of their descent marks the fate-bound period of one’s original destiny. Whenever this day arrives, it becomes the appointed limit—once every sixty days, six times a year. When the true officials descend, the fate-bound period of one’s original destiny spans one hundred and twenty years as two limits: sixty years as a minor limit, and one hundred twenty years as the major limit. When the limit is exhausted, death follows. Should one violate prohibitions and offend against their allotted years, their fate-bound period shortens. But those who accumulate yang merits, perform yin virtues, adhere to precepts and prohibitions, and revere the celestial mandate will find their limit extended—and with the extension of their limit, their life is prolonged.\n\nThere are three thousand Southern Mound Envoys, transformations of yang, where three *qi* coalesce into spirits.",

      "translated_text": "The Seven Thousand Divine Generals of the Northern Dipper True Lord are transformations of yin, where seven *qi* coalesce into spirits. When the True Official of one’s original destiny descends in majesty, all the perfected beings gather to protect and shield. This can dispel calamities, repent sins, invoke blessings, and prolong life. According to one’s capacity, one may present petitions and perform jiao rites, thereby augmenting and exalting their fortune and virtue. On the day of the descent, all the perfected beings arrive to guard and defend, and one may present petitions, perform jiao rites, repent sins, dispel calamities, prolong life, and invoke blessings. According to one’s capacity, one may establish merit, thereby augmenting and exalting their fortune and virtue.\n\nShould the limit of one’s original destiny be approaching and one remains unaware, failing to prepare vegetarian feasts or jiao rites, neglecting incense and offerings—this is to treat life lightly, to be deluded about one’s origin, and to disdain the human form. The celestial bureaus will strip away one’s emoluments, reduce one’s allotted years, and curtail one’s lifespan, often leading to premature death. If, as the limit of one’s original destiny approaches, one remains unaware, failing to prepare vegetarian feasts or jiao rites, to uphold the scriptural precepts, or to pay homage to the Dipper Perfected—this is to treat this life lightly, to forget one’s origin, and to debase one’s own body. The celestial bureaus will surely strip away one’s emoluments, reduce one’s allotted years, and thus many will die prematurely, unable to fulfill their destined years.\n\nThose who are deluded, even if they encounter the scriptural precepts, harbor disbelief and slander the true texts. Such individuals, after their bodies perish, will sink into the Three Wretched Realms and drift through the Six Destinies, forever losing the human form. Deeply lamentable, they bring this suffering upon themselves. Human delusion and error, even when encountering the scriptural precepts, lead some to harbor disbelief and even slander. After death, they fall into the Three Wretched Realms and Six Destinies, never again to attain a human body. As the saying goes: \"Heaven-made calamities may yet be avoided, but self-made calamities are inescapable.\" Though the Heavenly Worthy, moved by compassion, may arouse pity, the enforcers of the law must often grant leniency.\n\nIf, on the day of one’s original destiny, one prepares vegetarian feasts and jiao rites, and skillfully petitions the celestial bureaus, then for one lifetime at the limit of one’s original destiny, one may recite the true scriptures, abundantly present offerings, and thereby ensure that for three lifetimes one will always be reborn as a man—wealthy, noble, intelligent, and preeminent among humanity. If, on the day of one’s original destiny in this life, one adheres to the precepts and prohibitions, recites the true scriptures, and grandly performs vegetarian feasts and jiao rites, then for three lifetimes one will be reborn as a man—wealthy, noble, intelligent, and uniquely distinguished among humanity.\n\nFor those whose karmic endowment in this life is meager, though born among humanity, they may be poor and lowly. Even if they know their original destiny but lack the means to perform grand rites, if they can pour water and offer flowers, sincerely face the North Pole, bow their heads in reverence, and invoke the name of the True Lord of their original destiny, they will not pass their destined limit in vain. They will all attain life prolongation and fortune inscription, perpetually retaining the human form. Calamities will be dispelled, and boundless blessings will be obtained. If one is born poor and lowly, though aware of their original destiny, lacks the means to establish merit, yet can pour water and offer flowers, devoutly face the North Pole, bow their heads in reverence, and invoke the name of the Northern Dipper’s Star Lord of their original destiny, they will not pass their destined day in vain. They will all attain life prolongation and fortune inscription, perpetually retaining the human form. Calamities will be forever dispelled, and boundless blessings will be obtained.\n\nThe Heavenly Master rejoiced, leapt with joy, and bowed in reverence, praising the rarity of encountering this unsurpassed Dharma Bridge. The Heavenly Master, having received the scriptural Dharma, rejoiced and praised it, likening it to a Dharma Bridge—its crossing is endless, truly rare to encounter.\n\nThe Old Lord further addressed the Heavenly Master: The sins and blessings, good and evil of worldly people all belong to the celestial bureaus. To repent sins and dispel calamities, nothing surpasses cultivation and reverence. The sins and blessings, good and evil of worldly people are all governed by the Dipper Spirits. If one wishes to repent and cleanse transgressions, to dispel and avert calamities, nothing surpasses preparing vegetarian feasts, performing jiao rites, and cultivating reverence in accordance with the scriptures.\n\nOn the day of one’s original destiny, the day of the body’s inscription at the Zhongyuan Festival, and the day of the Yuanchen—there are two types of Yuanchen. The first is based on the Northern Dipper’s Seven Origins establishing life, where the Star Lord of one’s original destiny has left and right assistants as the Yuanchen. For yang men and yin women, the position preceding the clash is called the Yuanchen; for yin men and yang women, the position following the clash is called the Yuanchen. For example, if a man is born in the *zi* hour, *Tanlang* is the Star Lord of his original destiny, and *Zuofu* is the Yuanchen Star Lord. If a woman is born in the *zi* hour, *Tanlang* is the Star Lord of her original destiny, and *Youbi* is the Yuanchen Star Lord. If a man is born in the *chou* or *hai* hour, *Jumen* is the Star Lord of his original destiny, and *Youbi* is the Yuanchen Star Lord; for a woman, *Zuofu* is the Yuanchen Star Lord. The rest follow this pattern.\n\nThe second type is based on the sixty *jiazi* cycles as the Star Officials of one’s original destiny. In the Mysterious Numinosity method, they are called the Great Generals of the Original Destiny. For example, if a man is born in the *jiazi* year, *xinhai* is the Yuanchen Star Official; for a woman, *jisi* is the Yuanchen Star Official. If a man is born in the *yichou* year, *renwu* is the Yuanchen Star Official; for a woman, *jiashen* is the Yuanchen Star Official. The rest follow this pattern. Further, within the Five *Zi* Origins, one may discern the true and false. On these days, when the Yuanchen descends, one should purify the body, observe abstinence, practice the Dao, and recite scriptures.\n\nThe Yuanchen must never be offended. If one is born under the Yuanchen’s influence in one’s destiny, one will not escape its misfortunes in this lifetime. Though this is predetermined by heavenly mandate, one may repent and make amends on the day of the Yuanchen’s descent, transforming calamities into blessings. The Star Lords, Star Officials, Divine Generals, talismanic clerks, and their retinues of one’s original destiny hold positions of lord and minister, with clear distinctions of rank—yet people remain unaware of this.\n\nThe Post Horse: The Five Blessings Post Horse Divine Lord is an auspicious spirit of one’s original destiny. For those born in the *shen-zi-chen* years, it resides in the *yin* position; for those born in the *si-you-chou* years, it resides in the *hai* position; for those born in the *yin-wu-xu* years, it resides in the *shen* position; for those born in the *hai-mao-wei* years, it resides in the *si* position. The position corresponding to the decade of one’s birth is the primary position.\n\nThe Three Calamities of Diminution and Nine Adversities of Misfortune—this annotation refers to the preceding text on preserving one’s present kin and ensuring their peace. The *Scripture of Central Prohibitions* states: \"The people flicker like fireflies, each bearing a star. Every person has their own star of original destiny, with their own calamities and blessings. Yet, in general, these must follow the master *qi*. For a nation, the emperor and his ministers are the master *qi*; for a household, the family head is the master *qi*.\"",

But those who accumulate yang merits, perform yin virtues, adhere to precepts and prohibitions, and revere the celestial mandate will find their limit extended—and with the extension of their limit, their life is prolonged.\n\nThere are three thousand Southern Mound Envoys, transformations of yang, where three *qi* coalesce into spirits.",

      "translated_text": "The master *qi* endowed with the Dao can reverse celestial principles, transform calamity into fortune—my destiny lies within me, not in Heaven. This Dao encompasses Heaven and Earth, grasps yin and yang, and thus neither great fate can constrain it nor can yin and yang assail it. Yet if one fails to practice the Dao and perform meritorious deeds, one cannot escape the bounds of destiny.\n\nDuring the critical junctures of yearly and monthly adversities, one should await the resolution of hardship. If, however, one recklessly squanders life and loses sight of its origin, failing to cherish the human form, indulging in the three karmic actions, and unrestrainedly pursuing the six senses, accumulating transgressions and multiplying offenses, calamities will inevitably strike with severity. This may extend to implicating one’s kin, bringing misfortune upon the entire household—no small matter indeed.\n\nWhy is this so? Because the six relations and family members all arise from the primordial origin of one’s own destiny. For instance, those who give birth to me are my mother; those who raise me are my father; those of the same kind are my siblings; those I restrain are my wife and wealth; those I engender are my children and grandchildren—all stem from the primordial origin of my destiny. Furthermore, adding the number of months from one’s birth month to the hour of birth determines the \"destiny official.\" For men and women, these are arranged in reverse or sequential order, forming the twelve positions: first, the Palace of Destiny; second, the Palace of Wealth; third, the Palace of Siblings; fourth, the Palace of Fields and Dwellings; fifth, the Palace of Children and Grandchildren; sixth, the Palace of Servants; seventh, the Palace of Wives and Concubines; eighth, the Palace of Jealousy and Adversity; ninth, the Palace of Migration; tenth, the Palace of Official Rank and Emolument; eleventh, the Palace of Fortune and Virtue; twelfth, the Palace of Appearance. Applying the three *yuan*, four residences, and five phases, along with the stems and branches, to these positions, as they move through the yearly positions and the limits of one’s fate, one encounters calamity as calamity and fortune as fortune. Thus, one should first invoke and supplicate the primordial origin of one’s destiny and the *Yima* deity.\n\nThe primordial origin is one’s heart. For all people, the primordial origin is outwardly manifested in the eyes and inwardly concealed in the heart. The eyes survey the myriad things externally, while the heart races internally through the ten thousand affairs. Wherever the heart and eyes roam, the spirit also hastens—hence it is called the *Yima* of the primordial origin, ceaselessly galloping through affairs without respite.\n\nIf one can gather the heart and return to inner illumination, preserving the mysterious numen within, then one halts the galloping horse to manure the fields, inwardly nurturing form and spirit, solidifying embryonic breathing. Thereafter, the Three Corpses depart the body, the Nine Worms perish, and from whence could the Three Calamities and Nine Adversities arise? In due time, one receives destiny, and the hundred spirits harmonize and flourish—this is what is meant by the peace and tranquility of one’s kin.\n\nWhenever an adept—one who cultivates the Dao—holds this true scripture on their destiny’s birthdate, they externally subdue demonic spirits and internally pacify their true nature. Those who cultivate the Dao are called adepts; reciting this scripture on their destiny’s birthday enables them to externally subdue demonic spirits and internally nourish spirit and nature, naturally attaining the Dao and achieving perfection. Their merit extends to the realms of water and land; those who achieve the Dao bestow their virtue upon all beings, so that creatures that fly, walk, sink, or hide all receive its blessings.",

      "translated_text": "Its blessings extend to both the living and the departed; when one attains the Dao, their kin find peace and tranquility, and the nine generations of ancestors and seven lineages of descendants all receive its grace. Through repentance and reverence, one gradually ascends to the wondrous fruit. By reestablishing profound merit and realizing the Dao of emptiness and non-being, one attains the perfect wisdom of the sages, their presence as elusive as the hidden radiance, moving between existence and non-existence, roaming the clouds at will, ascending through the Golden Gate to unite with the sacred and true. Their form transcends the Three Realms, forever freed from the cycle of rebirth, their lifespan boundless, their joy and freedom complete.\n\nWhen one repents with reverence, the wondrous fruit and profound merit may be attained and established—this is the Dao, the inexhaustible source of life and transformation, the ceaseless flow of existence. Human life arises from emptiness and non-being, where spirit transforms into qi, and qi transforms into essence, thus taking form. The way of its application: the wise do not expend it externally but direct it inward, so that essence returns to qi, qi returns to spirit, and refining spirit to merge with the Dao, one reattains the wondrous state of emptiness and non-being. Spirit transforms without fixed form—this is the work of the sages. To know all things is to possess wisdom that pervades the myriad beings, yet the subtle and mysterious, the profoundly unknowable, remain beyond comprehension. Thus, their presence is as elusive as hidden radiance, moving between existence and non-existence, roaming the clouds at will, ascending through the Golden Gate. Form and spirit both attain perfection, uniting with the Dao in truth, returning together to the great transformation of the Three Purities. No longer bound by the cycle of rebirth, their lifespan knows no end, and they abide in carefree non-action, their primordial destiny fulfilled.\n\nWhenever men or women, on their destiny’s birthdate or during days of purification, purify body and mind, burn incense, and hold this true scripture; recognizing the star lord of their destiny under the Northern Dipper and offering sincere prayers, no good shall go unanswered. Disasters and transgressions dissolve, and the ten thousand sages and thousand perfected beings all come to guard and protect.\n\nThe Orthodox Unity Perfected Master, Celestial Master Zhang of Han, spoke to his disciple Zhao Sheng: \"The human body possesses three hun-souls: one governs destiny, one governs wealth and rank, and one governs misfortune and decline. It is also said that one hun-soul resides in the celestial palace of its destined star, one in the earthly prison, and one within the body. The seven po-souls constantly dwell within and do not disperse. The hun-souls belong to yang and move to give life, while the po-souls belong to yin and remain still to stabilize the form.\n\nOn one’s destiny’s birthdate, when the hun-souls descend into the body and unite with the corpse, they observe its appearance—whether it is withered or robust, weak or strong. If the three hun-souls circulate and descend without cease, the living person remains at peace, and disasters and illnesses do not arise. If on that day one purifies body and mind, abstains from wine and lust, wears clean new garments, burns incense, and cultivates goodness, and further, rests briefly, then the hun-souls unite with the po-souls, yin and yang merge, the Dao-qi flourishes within, and the root of life is firmly secured.\n\nIf on that day one indulges in wine and lust, confusing and defiling the body, then when the hun-souls return, they remain three paces away from the body, unable to unite. Filth and impurity assail them, and the hun-souls retreat. If this confusion occurs three times, and the hun-souls fail to unite with the po-souls, then yang weakens and yin prevails, and the po-souls seize the opportunity. The po-souls are the transformation of yin and constantly seek to prevent the hun-souls from returning to the body. If the hun-souls do not return, the po-souls commune with yin spirits, and when yin unites with yin, the five ghosts flourish. This gives rise to wandering spirits and manifold evils, causing one to fall into an unrousable sleep, the five senses to become confused, and disasters and illnesses to arise, leading ultimately to death.\n\nWhen the hun-souls return but cannot unite with the body, they grieve and weep, while the po-souls leap and dance, laughing and singing: 'Return, but there is no union for me; return, but there is no abode for me.' Thus, the five ghosts invade the chamber, and the Three Corpses rage wildly. The Three Ones are not guarded, and the true dwelling becomes empty.\" The *Central Yellow Scripture* states: \"Alas! The twelve towers of the mysterious palace—who would have thought they would become the dwelling of the Three Corpses? How sorrowful!\"\n\nOn one’s destiny’s birthdate, six times a year, the three hun-souls return to the body six times to subdue the yin po-souls, preventing the incursion of demonic paths. The hundred spirits gather, the hun-souls find peace, the po-souls are rectified, and the myriad qi endure. Free from suffering and affliction, the body radiates light, preserving eternal life. One may ascend as a flying immortal. Moreover, on the day of one’s destiny’s birth, when the myriad spirits descend, during days of purification, one purifies body and mind, burns incense, recites the scripture, recognizes the star lord of their destiny under the Northern Dipper, and offers sincere prayers. Good intentions evoke responses, disasters and transgressions dissolve, and the ten thousand sages and thousand perfected beings all come to guard and protect—thus the Dao of immortality is swiftly attained.\n\nWherever this scripture resides, the thousand perfected pay reverence, and the ten thousand sages protect and uphold it. Demonic spirits vanish in silence, and malevolent spirits hide away. Worldly disasters and calamities all dissolve. When the scripture is held in the heart, the true sages within the body revere and protect it, so that demons cannot intrude, ghosts and spirits cannot bewitch, and the disasters and calamities of the world all vanish of themselves.\n\nThis is called the *Northern Dipper Destiny Prolonging Life Scripture and Its Instructions*, the path of cultivating the true. This scripture requires personal practice—it is the scripture and instructions for prolonging life on one’s destiny’s birthdate, the path of cultivating the true.
