Regularly in the evenings, contemplate them, envisioning the august forms and majestic radiance of the August Lords and Ladies, recalling their surnames and personal names, and fixing them firmly in the mind. Those who perceive the Eighth and Ninth Stars will enjoy limitless longevity.\n\nThe Nine August Lords and Nine August Ladies are the ethereal essences of the nine qi, the numinous souls of the nine heavens, the wondrous images of the nine thearchs, and the mighty spirits of the nine transformations. Men and women who study the Dao, wear and invoke them, move about or remain still while contemplating the Perfected, and in times of sorrow, illness, or calamity, seek to cure sickness and support the infirm—those who cultivate themselves and aid others, ever mindful of them, will see disasters vanish and misfortunes disperse, enjoying blessings and communion with the spirits.\n\nIn times of urgency, inscribe the talisman with cinnabar on bamboo or silk according to the method, face north, bow twice, and ingest it with well-flower water. After ingesting it once, complete nine cycles. If one or two or three concerns are resolved and illnesses cured, one may cease. There are no other incantations—only the contemplation of the nine hidden names. Diligently establishing good deeds and persisting for nine years without slackening will surely attain spiritual communion.\n\nThe essential purport of the Jade Thearch must not be rashly disclosed. Cultivate it in secret, and one will attain the rank of Perfected Person and August Lord, associating with the supreme sages, the Three Pure Ones, and the Perfected Persons. Upon receiving it, inscribe it on silk, draw the diagram, and transmit it with reverent petition. Keep the secret names in mind, and one will achieve transcendence.\n\nFor all who receive the *River Chart*, first petition the inner hidden names of the Nine August Lords. Face a fast of nine days, seven days, five days, three days, or one day, offering prayers according to the time. When the fast’s term is complete, in mountain lodges, altars, or halls, ensure seclusion and quietude, then present the memorial as follows.\n\n*(The following is missing.)*\n\nHere ends the *Precious Register of the River Chart of Supreme Purity*.\n\n**Textual Notes on the *Precious Register of the River Chart of Supreme Purity*:**\n\n1.

Regularly in the evenings, contemplate them, envisioning the august forms and majestic radiance of the August Lords and Ladies, recalling their surnames and personal names, and fixing them firmly in the mind. Those who perceive the Eighth and Ninth Stars will enjoy limitless longevity.\n\nThe Nine August Lords and Nine August Ladies are the ethereal essences of the nine qi, the numinous souls of the nine heavens, the wondrous images of the nine thearchs, and the mighty spirits of the nine transformations. Men and women who study the Dao, wear and invoke them, move about or remain still while contemplating the Perfected, and in times of sorrow, illness, or calamity, seek to cure sickness and support the infirm—those who cultivate themselves and aid others, ever mindful of them, will see disasters vanish and misfortunes disperse, enjoying blessings and communion with the spirits.\n\nIn times of urgency, inscribe the talisman with cinnabar on bamboo or silk according to the method, face north, bow twice, and ingest it with well-flower water. After ingesting it once, complete nine cycles. If one or two or three concerns are resolved and illnesses cured, one may cease. There are no other incantations—only the contemplation of the nine hidden names. Diligently establishing good deeds and persisting for nine years without slackening will surely attain spiritual communion.\n\nThe essential purport of the Jade Thearch must not be rashly disclosed. Cultivate it in secret, and one will attain the rank of Perfected Person and August Lord, associating with the supreme sages, the Three Pure Ones, and the Perfected Persons. Upon receiving it, inscribe it on silk, draw the diagram, and transmit it with reverent petition. Keep the secret names in mind, and one will achieve transcendence.\n\nFor all who receive the *River Chart*, first petition the inner hidden names of the Nine August Lords. Face a fast of nine days, seven days, five days, three days, or one day, offering prayers according to the time. When the fast’s term is complete, in mountain lodges, altars, or halls, ensure seclusion and quietude, then present the memorial as follows.\n\n*(The following is missing.)*\n\nHere ends the *Precious Register of the River Chart of Supreme Purity*.",
