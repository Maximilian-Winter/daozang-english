  "full_translation": "The **Sutra of the Thunderous Dao/Way Jade Pivot Expiating Guilt** (*Léitíng Yùshū Yòuzuì Fǎchàn Jīng*)\n\nHumbly heard of the **Highest Celestial Abode of the Thunderous Dao/Way** (*Gāoshàng Shénxiāo Zhī Tiān*), the **Nine Celestial Abodes of the Responding Primordial** (*Jiǔ Tiān Yìngyuán Zhī Fǔ*), whose vast and boundless influence transcends even the lofty eons, and whose harmonizing grace originates from a single sincere heart. Humbly offering the **true incense of the Dao/Way** (*Dàodé Zhī Zhēnxiāng*), and gazing upward to invoke the **sacred realm of the Void** (*Xūwú Zhī Shèngjìng*), we earnestly rely on this single stick of incense to permeate and benefit all beings.\n\nWith our present submission and sincere devotion, we humbly report and offer our reverence to the **Incomparable Supreme Dao/Way’s Scripture Master, the Precious Three Realms of Highest Venerability** (*Wúshàng Zhìzhēn Dàojīng Shībǎo Sānjìng Gāozūn*), the **Nine Celestial Abodes Responding Primordial Thunderous Universal Transformation Celestial Venerable** (*Jiǔ Tiān Yìngyuán Léishēng Pǔhuà Tiānzūn*), the **Celestial Thunderous Dao/Way Imperial True Lord, the Exalted Thunder Teacher** (*Jiǔxiāo Léitíng Dìzhēn Qīngshī Shìxiàng*), the **Celestial Lords of the Ten Directions** (*Shífāng Zhūtiān Dìjūn*), the **Thirty-six Celestial Abodes Supreme Saints Above** (*Sānshísì Tiān Shàngshèng*), the **Jade Pivot Thunder Teacher, the Radiant and Resplendent True Lord** (*Yùshū Qǐjiào Léishī Huòxī Zhēnjun*), the **Thunder Department Officials**, and all **sentient beings of the Three Realms** (*Sānjiè Wànlíng*).\n\nHumbly we behold the **Great Compassion** (*Hóngcí*), and pray that the **Highest Venerables** may descend in grace, universally granting protection to the true incense, and all offerings being received in full. We, the subjects, hear that in ancient times the **Red Scriptures with Jade Characters** (*Chìshū Yùzì*) were revealed by the **Primordial Beginning** (*Yuánshǐ*) to open the **Azure Abyss** (*Bìluò*) for the salvation of humankind, while the **Phoenix’s Casket and Dragon’s Chapter** (*Fèngzhì Lóngzhāng*) were expounded by the **Thunder Teacher** (*Léishī*) from the **Celestial Abode of the Thunderous Dao/Way** (*Shénxiāo*).\n\nHumbly we acknowledge that the **Nine Celestial Abodes Responding Primordial Thunderous Universal Transformation Celestial Venerable** (*Jiǔ Tiān Yìngyuán Léishēng Pǔhuà Tiānzūn*) is the **Great Sage of the Nine Celestial Abodes’ Purity and Integrity** (*Jiǔ Tiān Yìngyuán Zhēnmíng Zhī Dàshèng*), truly the **incarnation of the Jade Purity True King** (*Yùqīng Zhēnwáng Zhī Huàshēn*). His grace extends to the **Ten Directions**, and his **virtue/power** (*dé*) permeates all beings. He governs the **Thirty-six Celestial Abodes of the Nine Heavens**, with each heaven submitting to his sovereign authority. Through **fifteen hundred eons** (*Lìjiè Qiānwǔbǎi*), he has guided the **compassionate thoughts of the Dao/Way** (*wǎcíbēi Zhī niàn*) in every eon.\n\nIf one but sincerely recites this sutra, all wishes shall be fulfilled and answered. Whatever is sought, it shall be granted in response. We, the subjects, now with utmost sincerity, make our **intention of entering the Dao/Way’s service** (*rùshì yìxiàng*), having already expounded and clarified our devotion. We trust in the **Highest Venerable’s** (*Gāozūn*) mercy and pray for his gracious inspection and review.\n\nHumbly we await your edict.\n\nThe **Highest Venerable, the Universal Sovereign of the Nine Heavens and the Original Thunder Voice** (*Jiǔtiān Yìngyuán Léishēng Pǔhuà Tiānzūn*), the **Great Sage, Great Compassionate One**, the **Most August Emperor, Most August Dao/Way**, is the **Father of the Drought-Born** and the **Teacher of All Living Beings**. If one but invokes his name, all shall obtain their heart’s desire.\n\nNow, your humble servant and all the gathered assembly, with utmost sincerity, bow before the **Great Sage** and pledge our **devotion of heart**, earnestly worshipping the **Highest Venerable, the Universal Sovereign of the Nine Heavens and the Original Thunder Voice** (*Jiǔtiān Yìngyuán Léishēng Pǔhuà Tiānzūn*). From **One Heaven** to **Thirty-six Heavens**, we offer **one prostration** to **thirty-six prostrations**, with each invocation unceasing and each reverence without pause.\n\nWith reverent hope, we gaze upon the **Dao/Way’s Compassionate Radiance** (*dàocí liúguāng*) seated upon the **Precious Seat**, trusting that he may **perceive our sincere devotion** (*qūzhī cóngyù zhī rén*) and **grant his benevolent favor** in response.\n\nYour servants’ hearts are overwhelmed with longing, yearning for his boundless mercy with deepest yearning. We humbly submit this petition.\n\nThe following **praise** (*cìzàn*) declares:\n*The **Primordial Qi** (*zǔqì*) fills the boundless void,\nAnd the **Nine Heavens’ Original Sovereign** (*Jiǔtiān Yuán*) resides therein.\nHe commands the thunder and governs the rain with golden seals,\nAnd sustains all life with the **Precious Axis** (*bèiyùshū*).\nAll beings in the **Three Realms** (*sānjiè*) are granted liberation,\nAnd in the **Ten Directions** (*shífāng*), no path is barred to his **vehicle** (*chē*).\nO mighty **Universal Sovereign of the Original Beginning** (*Pǔhuà Míngyuánshǐ*), his radiance matches the sun and moon—trust in him shall not be in vain.*\n\nThe **assembly** (*zhònghé*) in unison:\n*We submit our lives and pay homage to the **Great Universal Sovereign** (*Dà Pǔhuà Tiānzūn*).*\n\nYour humble servant has heard that **One Qi** (*yīqì*) divides into the **True** (*zhēn*), and the **Nine Heavens** (*Jiǔtiān*) spread their transformations. The **Most August Emperor, Most August Dao/Way** (*Zhìhuáng Zhìdào*), as **Father of All Living Beings** and **Teacher of All Souls**, has endured from ancient times to the present. He governs the **Three Realms** (*sānjiè*) with his **compassionate thoughts** (*wǎcíbēi Zhī niàn*) and unifies the **Five Thunders** (*wǔléi*) to harmonize **yin and yang** (*yīnyáng*), thus tempering all cold things. He weaves the **patterns of Heaven and Earth** (*jīngwěi tiāndì*) to establish the **Four Seasons** (*sìshí*).\n\nSeated upon the **Jade Dream Celestial Platforms** (*yùfàn céngtái*), he holds aloft the **Golden Light As-You-Wish** (*Jīnguāng Rúyì*), expounding the **Precious Axis’s profound teachings** (*shuō yùshū miàozhì*), and instructing the **Thunder Master, the Illustrious Elder** (*léishī huàngwēng*), thereby benefiting all living beings and spreading his **vehicle** among the common folk.\n\nBoth the **fore-awakened** (*rúxiānjué*) and the **late-awakened** (*rúhòujué*) all know to pay homage to the **True Doctrine** (*Zhēnzōng*). Whether one knows or does not know, all shall transcend and awaken to the **Most August Dao/Way** (*Zhìdào*).\n\nYour humble servants, with deepest reverence, **accept the Precious Teachings** (*qīnchéng bǎoxùn*), and have obtained the **Jade Scriptures** (*déyuè lángshū*). We humbly submit this prayer.\n\nThe **Universal Transformation Celestial Sovereign**, indeed the **Great Emperor of Longevity**, governs the **Nine-Heaven Palace of Response and Origin** and oversees the **Five-Thunder Tribunal of Judgment and Investigation**. Surveying the myriad heavens, wandering through the Three Realms, he registers the **Thunder Department’s ghosts and spirits**, and wields authority over **human virtue and vice**. His rewards and punishments are impartial, not missing even the slightest fraction—those who accumulate merit are recorded for noble promotion, while those with wicked hearts and unfilial deeds are **beheaded in spirit and annihilated in soul**.\n\nThus, it is fitting to **surrender to the Divine Dao/Way of Thunder** and **pledge allegiance to the Celestial Palace**. Reflecting upon our lowly selves—**common mortal flesh, impure essence, wandering corpses of flesh**—from past kalpas until now, our sins have piled like mountains. Our **three evil deeds of the mind**: greed, anger, and delusion. Our **three evil deeds of the body**: killing, theft, and licentiousness. Our **four evil deeds of speech**: slander, abusive language, and idle chatter. **Ostentatious words and falsehoods**, every thought and impulse, reckless actions—**profaning the Sacred and True**, defying heaven and earth, reviling wind and rain, exposing the stars, disobeying rulers and teachers, disrespecting parents, oppressing the weak, arrogating over kin, slaughtering living beings, hoarding grain with false measures, exacting cruel laws and harsh punishments, seizing by force, committing adultery, and practicing witchcraft and rebellion.\n\nFrom trivial to grave, day by day, month by month, we have incurred the **jealousy of ghosts, the wrath of gods, and the anger of the earth**. These crimes, with no path to confess, we now stand before the Dao and seek mercy through repentance.\n\nMay the **Thunder’s Universal Transformation** and the **Emperor’s virtue of compassion** forgive our past and present transgressions, melting them like ice. May we avert the **three calamities and nine adversities**, dissolving them like snow. Grant us **bodily peace and household purity**, that our living kin may flourish under protection, and our ancestors ascend to bliss.\n\nWe extol your name and contemplate your form, gazing upon the **Thirty-Six Heavens** with devoted reverence. With a hundred thousand repentances, may all offenses dissolve at each invocation.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we first offer praise:\n\n*\"The Celestial Sovereign, who from five hundred kalpas past has cultivated a pure and boundless heart—\nMay all future beings, across the ten directions of earths and heavens,\nIf they hear my name and surrender with a single vow, all be liberated.\nToday, we humbly surrender in the **Nine-Light Hall’s secret chamber**,\nUpon the **Jade Scripture’s Seven-Treasured Platform**,\nBefore the **Nine-Heaven Pure and Illustrious Great Sage**—\nMay you not abandon us in future vows,\nShining your grace upon this defiled realm.\nWith dragon-carriages and phoenix-chariots, descending from the Thirty-Six Heavens,\nWe, your humble servants, are fortunate in countless lives,\nDevotedly surrendering to the **Universal Transformation Lord**.\nWith sincere devotion, we bow and chant your sacred name each day beneath the heavens:*\n\n**‘Highest Dao/Way-Silent Celestial Sovereign,\nHighest Yangqi Celestial Sovereign.’**\n\n**‘With sincere devotion, we bow to the Nine-Heaven Response-and-Origin Thunder-Voice Universal Transformation Celestial Sovereign,\nHighest Cavernous-Light Celestial Sovereign,\nHighest Purple-Charge Celestial Sovereign,\nHighest Jade-Spirit Celestial Sovereign,\nHighest Pure-Void Celestial Sovereign.’**\n\n**‘With

Sovereign,\nHighest Auxiliary-Emperor Celestial Sovereign.’**\n\n**‘With sincere devotion, we bow to the Nine-Heaven Response-and-Origin Thunder-Voice Universal Transformation Celestial Sovereign,\nHighest Mystic-Principle Celestial Sovereign,\nHighest Biased-Eccentric Celestial Sovereign,\nHighest Left-Gang Celestial Sovereign,\nHighest Master-of-Transformation Celestial Sovereign.’**\n\n**‘With sincere devotion, we bow to the Nine-Heaven Response-and-Origin Thunder-Voice Universal Transformation Celestial Sovereign,\nHighest Symbolic-Approach Celestial Sovereign,\nHighest Preserve-Bloom Celestial Sovereign,\nHighest Stabilize-Essence Celestial Sovereign,\nHighest Azure-Bloom Celestial Sovereign.’**\n\n**‘With sincere devotion, we bow to the Nine-Heaven Response-and-Origin Thunder-Voice Universal Transformation Celestial Sovereign,\nHighest Splendor-Lang Celestial Sovereign,\nHighest Vermilion-Essence Celestial Sovereign,\nHighest Steady-Pillar Celestial Sovereign,\nHighest Broad-Doctrine Celestial Sovereign.’**\n\n**‘With sincere devotion, we bow to the Nine-Heaven Response-and-Origin Thunder-Voice Universal Transformation Celestial Sovereign,\nHighest Vast-Emperor Celestial Sovereign,\nHighest Rare-Mystic Celestial Sovereign,\nHighest Celebration-Shelter Celestial Sovereign,\nHighest Celestial-Lou Celestial Sovereign.’**\n\n**‘With sincere devotion, we bow to the Nine-Heaven Response-and-Origin Thunder-Voice Universal Transformation Celestial Sovereign,\nHighest Metamorphosis-Immortal Celestial Sovereign,\nHighest Ascend-Mystic Celestial Sovereign,\nHighest Reverent-August Celestial Sovereign,\nHighest Transpose-Spirit Celestial Sovereign.’**\n\n**‘With sincere devotion, we bow to the Nine-Heaven Response-and-Origin Thunder-Voice Universal Transformation Celestial Sovereign,\nHighest Jade-Spirit Celestial Sovereign,\nHighest Ascend-Extreme Celestial Sovereign.’**\n\n**Circumambulating in praise:**\n*‘Supreme Jade-Purity King, ruling the Thirty-Six Heavens,\nThe Nine-Heaven Universal Transformation Lord, manifesting forms across all directions.\nDisheveled-haired, riding a qilin, barefoot upon layered ice,\nWielding the Nine-Heaven qi, whipping thunder with a wind-lash.\nWith wisdom’s power, subduing all demonic spirits,\nRescuing souls from endless night, benefiting all living beings.\nLike the Milky Way’s waters, pouring through countless eyes and moons,\nVowing in future lives to forever rest in the Celestial Sovereign’s teachings.’*\n\nAfter completing the rites, we kneel in repentance:\n\n**‘Your humble servants and followers, with sincere devotion, surrender body, spirit, and fate—\nTo the Supreme Triple Jewel, the Nine-Heaven Response-and-Origin Thunder-Voice Universal Transformation Celestial Sovereign,\nTo the Thunder-Clan Holy Ones assembled.\nWe humbly beseech your boundless mercy, that your vast grace may descend.\nWith our present surrender and repentance, we confess:\nFrom past kalpas until this life, we have committed countless offenses—\nKilling, theft, licentiousness, greed, anger, delusion, and love of strife.\nThe ocean of wrongdoing is boundless, the mountain of self and others insurmountable.\nWe have harmed sentient beings, injured life, strayed from the True Dao/Way,\nBroken precepts and violated laws, incurring the enmity of the underworld,\nNamed in the registers of the Seven Elemental Tribunals,\nOr within the Three Officials’ bureaus,\nOr falsely accused by ghosts below, or condemned by heaven above.’**\n\nWe have not yet received forgiveness, lest we be ensnared by lingering calamities.\nWe fear the malevolent influences of the Nine Celestial Luminaries,\nThe perverse movements of the Five Phases,\nThe clashing of yin and yang,\nAnd the fateful divisions of the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches.\n\nOr we may encounter the Six Calamities and Seven Injuries,\nOr fall upon solitary stars and meager constellations,\nWith inauspicious yearly clashes and declining natal stars,\nAs the Killing and Destructive Stars assail us,\nAnd the Heavenly Net and Earthly Web ensnare us.\n\nOr we may suffer transgressions from the Earth and Wood directions,\nOr misfortunes from Water and Fire imprisonment,\nAs curses and oppressions assail us,\nAnd grudges and enemies confront us,\nWith inescapable disasters and inexplicable misfortunes,\nAnd myriad obstructions.\n\nWithout this confession and repentance, how could we hope for absolution?\nWe humbly pray to the Most Exalted Sage,\nThat You may look down upon our sincerity,\nAnd grant us Your blessings in the future,\nForgiving our countless offenses of the past.\n\nMay disasters vanish like lightning swept away,\nAnd blessings arise like clouds born anew.\nMay our actions and inactions be free from perilous fears,\nAnd our steps be guided toward harmonious fortune.\n\nMay the stars move in orderly sequence,\nAnd the celestial cycles open wide,\nSo that in all times, we may forever abide under the Dao’s shelter.\n\nWith devoted reverence, we bow and thank the Supreme and True Three Jewels.\n\n**Threefold Prostrations, Threefold Thanks**\n*[Recitation of the Sutra]*\n**Dedication**\n\nAll previous rites of confession and merit from the sutra have been fully completed.\nNow, before the Dao, we humbly extend our dedication.\n\nWe earnestly wish that the Three Jewels, exalted and supreme,\nThe Nine-Heavenly Saints,\nThe Thunder-Clan officials and all beings of the Three Realms,\nMay grant their enlightened insight and universal blessings.\n\nMay the *qi* of the Five Thunders from the Ninth Heaven descend,\nAnd be bestowed upon all beings.\n\nMay the sins of countless lifetimes and kalpas be pardoned,\nAnd all obstructions dissolved.\n\nWe humbly hope that the Heavenly Sovereign, Great Compassionate,\nThe Heavenly Sovereign, Great Sage,\nWill grant our prayers as we wish,\nAnd fulfill our aspirations as we invoke.\n\nMay our lives and fortunes be forever steadfast,\nAnd our households share in prosperity.\n\nMay all our desires be fulfilled,\nOur petitions granted,\nOur wishes realized,\nAnd our expiations successful.\n\nIn this life and the next,\nMay we always encounter auspicious causes,\nAnd all sentient beings ascend to the Dao’s shore.\n\nAs the supreme cause of merit,\nWe bow and chant:\nTo the Three Pure Ones of the Three Realms,\nThe Thunder-Voice Universal Transformation Celestial Sovereign,\nThe Celestial Sovereign of Boundless Grace and Forgiveness,\nThe Celestial Sovereign of Infinite Blessings,\nWhose inconceivable virtues are beyond measure.\n\n**The Thunderous Jade Axis Law of Forgiveness for Offenses is now complete.**",

      "translated_text": "The **Universal Transformation Celestial Sovereign**, indeed the **Great Emperor of Longevity**, governs the **Nine-Heaven Palace of Response and Origin** and oversees the **Five-Thunder Tribunal of Judgment and Investigation**. Surveying the myriad heavens, wandering through the Three Realms, he registers the **Thunder Department’s ghosts and spirits**, and wields authority over **human virtue and vice**. His rewards and punishments are impartial, not missing even the slightest fraction—those who accumulate merit are recorded for noble promotion, while those with wicked hearts and unfilial deeds are **beheaded in spirit and annihilated in soul**.\n\nThus, it is fitting to **surrender to the Divine Dao/Way of Thunder** and **pledge allegiance to the Celestial Palace**. Reflecting upon our lowly selves—**common mortal flesh, impure essence, wandering corpses of flesh**—from past kalpas until now, our sins have piled like mountains. Our **three evil deeds of the mind**: greed, anger, and delusion. Our **three evil deeds of the body**: killing, theft, and licentiousness. Our **four evil deeds of speech**: slander, abusive language, and idle chatter. **Ostentatious words and falsehoods**, every thought and impulse, reckless actions—**profaning the Sacred and True**, defying heaven and earth, reviling wind and rain, exposing the stars, disobeying rulers and teachers, disrespecting parents, oppressing the weak, arrogating over kin, slaughtering living beings, hoarding grain with false measures, exacting cruel laws and harsh punishments, seizing by force, committing adultery, and practicing witchcraft and rebellion.\n\nFrom trivial to grave, day by day, month by month, we have incurred the **jealousy of ghosts, the wrath of gods, and the anger of the earth**. These crimes, with no path to confess, we now stand before the Dao and seek mercy through repentance.\n\nMay the **Thunder’s Universal Transformation** and the **Emperor’s virtue of compassion** forgive our past and present transgressions, melting them like ice. May we avert the **three calamities and nine adversities**, dissolving them like snow. Grant us **bodily peace and household purity**, that our living kin may flourish under protection, and our ancestors ascend to bliss.\n\nWe extol your name and contemplate your form, gazing upon the **Thirty-Six Heavens** with devoted reverence. With a hundred thousand repentances, may all offenses dissolve at each invocation.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we first offer praise:\n\n*\"The Celestial Sovereign, who from five hundred kalpas past has cultivated a pure and boundless heart—\nMay all future beings, across the ten directions of earths and heavens,\nIf they hear my name and surrender with a single vow, all be liberated.\nToday, we humbly surrender in the **Nine-Light Hall’s secret chamber**,\nUpon the **Jade Scripture’s Seven-Treasured Platform**,\nBefore the **Nine-Heaven Pure and Illustrious Great Sage**—\nMay you not abandon us in future vows,\nShining your grace upon this defiled realm.\nWith dragon-carriages and phoenix-chariots, descending from the Thirty-Six Heavens,\nWe, your humble servants, are fortunate in countless lives,\nDevotedly surrendering to the **Universal Transformation Lord**.\nWith sincere devotion, we bow and chant your sacred name each day beneath the heavens:*\n\n**‘Highest Dao/Way-Silent

Nine-Heaven Response-and-Origin Thunder-Voice Universal Transformation Celestial Sovereign,\nHighest Jade-Spirit Celestial Sovereign,\nHighest Ascend-Extreme Celestial Sovereign.’**\n\n**Circumambulating in praise:**\n*‘Supreme Jade-Purity King, ruling the Thirty-Six Heavens,\nThe Nine-Heaven Universal Transformation Lord, manifesting forms across all

spirits,\nRescuing souls from endless night, benefiting all living beings.\nLike the Milky Way’s waters, pouring through countless eyes and moons,\nVowing in future lives to forever rest in the Celestial Sovereign’s teachings.’*\n\nAfter completing the rites, we kneel in repentance:\n\n**‘Your humble servants and followers, with sincere devotion, surrender body, spirit, and fate—\nTo the Supreme Triple Jewel, the Nine-Heaven Response-and-Origin Thunder-Voice Universal Transformation Celestial Sovereign,\nTo the Thunder-Clan Holy Ones assembled.\nWe humbly beseech your boundless mercy,

greed, anger, delusion, and love of strife.\nThe ocean of wrongdoing is boundless, the mountain of self and others insurmountable.\nWe have harmed sentient beings, injured life, strayed from the True
