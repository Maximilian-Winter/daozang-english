  "full_translation": "**The Golden Elixir Reversion Alchemy Verification Diagram**\n\n**Title:** *The Golden Elixir Reversion Alchemy Verification Diagram*\nOne scroll.\nOriginal attribution: Composed by Longmeizi, from the Southern Song.\nSource text: *Zhengtong Daozang* (Orthodox Daoist Canon), *Dongzhen* (Cavern of the Perfect) section, *Lingtu* (Numinous Diagrams) category.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Golden Elixir Reversion Alchemy Verification Diagram**\nComposed by Longmeizi:\n\n*\"I once exchanged death for life through alchemical refinement—\nMy name was inscribed on jade tablets, yet remained obscure.\nSeeking a master and pursuing the Dao,\nMy heart found harmony only in the alchemical scriptures.\n\nGood and evil lie within the self;\nAscension and decline depend on one’s own efforts.\n\nObserving the *Total Immortals* tradition,\nI learned that from antiquity onward,\nTen thousand have ascended in spirit,\nEight thousand have relocated their dwellings.\nWas this solely due to innate endowment?\nOr did they achieve it through diligent practice?\n\nIf Huangdi was born divine and spiritually luminous,\nIt was by Heaven’s bestowal.\nYet if Jingyang refined his Dao to perfection,\nWas it not through human effort?\n\nOne must await the exhaustion of evil karma\nBefore virtuous transformation takes root.\n\nSome encountered the Dao while guarding the pass,\nOthers while crossing the sea,\nSome through trials with demons grew only firmer in resolve,\nOthers endured tests without faltering in aspiration.\nObtaining it was arduous, yet cultivation demanded precision—\nRefining in the grand halls of Hongdu,\nRetreating beneath Taihua and Songshan.\n\nSome dispersed in the red dust of the world,\nLike Li Tao’s eight hundred or Anqi’s three thousand.\nOthers soared in broad daylight,\nLike Zixia’s phoenix flight or Qin Gao’s control of the turtle.\nSome loathed the world and achieved *shixie* (corpse dissolution),\nOthers remained in the world while preserving their form,\nSome master-disciple pairs ascended together,\nOthers saw ancestral and descendant lines all attain transcendence.\n\nSome found it difficult to obtain but easy to perfect,\nOthers found it easy to obtain but difficult to perfect.\nThe records are complete—\nNo exaggeration can be added.\n\nFrom childhood, I devoted myself to the pursuit of emptiness and purity,\nSeeking widely among schools, unable to distinguish truth from falsehood.\nFor three generations, I studied under a hundred masters,\nYet all my learning came only after profound awakening.\nHow could such rare matters be achieved with ease?\n\nTo ride the crane in leisurely flight,\nOne must first gather the alchemical funds.\nThe vulgar scoff at this,\nWhile the sage remains silent.\n\nA misstep of a hair’s breadth\nCan lead to a thousand-li error.\nIf Heaven’s secrets are carelessly revealed,\nThe lineage’s guilt will extend to posterity,\nAnd the untransmitted Dao will weigh heavily upon me.\n\nI hesitated to speak, yet could not desist.\nIf the mysteries are hidden in the profound,\nWhy not lay out their broad outlines?\n\nThus, I recorded my master’s teachings\nAnd illustrated them in diagrams.\nThe **Nine Chapters of External Alchemy** exhaust the subtleties of elixir crafting.\nThe **Nine Chapters of Internal Alchemy** detail the nurturing of the elixir.\n\nThe alchemist must have a source—\nThus, there is the **Original Foundation**.\nWith the foundation comes generation—\nThus, there is **Heaven and Earth**.\nUsing Heaven and Earth for refining—\nThus, there are **cauldrons and vessels**.\nThe vessels hold medicinal substances—\nThus, there is **lead and mercury**.\nLead and mercury must be measured precisely—\nThus, there is **harmonization**.\nHarmonization produces the **yellow sprout**—\nThus, there is **true soil**.\nThe alchemical adept values extraction—\nThus, there is **collection**.\nThe process follows established methods—\nThus, there is **regulation**.\nCrafting requires like-minded companions—\nThus, there is **assistance**.\n\nThis pertains to **External Alchemy**,\nIllustrating the **Nine Chapters of Alchemical Force**.\n\nAfter collection, one must ingest the elixir—\nThus, there is **elixir ingestion**.\nUpon completion, one must temper and nourish—\nThus, there are the **Nine Cauldrons**.\nNourishment relies entirely on fire—\nThus, there is **fire progression**.\nFire has phases of advance and retreat—\nThus, there is **fire retreat**.\nAdvance and retreat follow medicinal symbols—\nThus, there is **withdrawal and addition**.\nAdvance and retreat require rest—\nThus, there is **bathing**.\nAfter bathing, the elixir is complete—\nThus, there is the **Golden Elixir**.\nThough the elixir is formed, the nature may not yet be perfected—\nThus, there is **embracing the Primordial**.\nGuarding the One and embracing the Primordial,\nLife is secured, nature penetrates,\nThe form ascends to Heaven’s gate,\nAnd one attains the rank of True Person—\nThus, there is **Returning to the Primordial**.\n\nThis pertains to **Internal Alchemy**,\nThe **Nine Chapters of Elixir Nurturing**.\n\nOnce elixir ingestion is complete,\nOne must temper the fire for a year,\nPiercing the interplay of yin and yang,\nContracting and conserving the seasons,\nPlundering **27,360,000** units of vital *qi*,\nAnd returning to the **913,724,680** treasures of the宝.\nThus, lifespan becomes boundless,\nAnd though the allotted span may decay,\nOne must harmonize self and other,\nMerge color and emptiness,\nAwaken to the naturalness of the Primordial,\nAnd attain the true awareness of the source.\n\nIn motion, one plays in ease;\nIn stillness, one enters the Great Void,\nAchieving the vehicle of no obstruction,\nAnd eternally returning to the original source.\n\nUniting past enlightenment with future return,\nThis makes **twenty chapters** in total.\n\nAppended are **Four and Five Companions’ External Alchemy Practices**,\nTo connect beginning and end,\nInterweave the text,\nAnd guide the lost.\nThus, one may distinguish truth from falsehood,\nAnd separate true adepts from false scholars.\n\nPlaced at the end for careful study,\nThis is not meant as a model for the accomplished,\nBut as a verification for later learners.\n\nComposed on the first day of the eleventh month, *Gengyin* (戊寅) of the *Jiawu* (甲午) year of *QingSong Jia定* (嘉定),\nBy Longmeizi.\n\n---\n**The Golden Elixir Reversion Alchemy Verification Diagram**\nThis diagram was personally received by my predecessor, Yuxian,\nAs a handwritten original from the ancestral master, Longmeizi.\n**Do not show this to others.**\nTreasure it!\nCherish it!\n\n*—Recorded by Wuning Wang Jingxuan (武宁王景玄) in the *Ending Peace* era (端平甲午).*\n\n**The Primordial Source**\nBefore the murk of chaos held no light,\nThe wind-wheel churned and forged true lead.\nWhen stillness reaches its utmost peak,\nMotion springs forth—boundless becomes finite.\n\nQi, in its essence, first takes form from void,\nThe Two Principles revolve within the fixed.\nEndless transformation knows no end,\nA world of wonders brewed within the cauldron’s heaven.\n\n**Awakening**\nDiscarding the corpse, I turn to gaze—\nMountains of sorrow, waves of endless tears.\nThough worlds dissolve, their ruin is inevitable,\nAnd mortal life, like pinched fingers, fleeting joy.\nBorn male, then female, in endless change,\nHorned, furred—through myriad forms I roam.\nUnless this life’s cycle awakens me,\nWhat then remains to see?\n\n**Heaven and Earth**\nBefore differentiation, the Undivided Whole—\nClear and turbid split, the Two Symbols complete.\nYin’s female, Yang’s male, yet one in essence,\nWood-Dragon and Metal-Tiger span the ages.\nModifying solitude to seek the Dao,\nHow could rigid-yielding forge the Mysterious?\nDaily life ignores the inverted logic—\nOnly those who grasp this are true Immortals.\n\n**The Cauldron**\nRefining elixirs depends on furnace and cauldron,\nTheir forms must mirror Heaven and Earth’s model.\nRound, five trigrams encircle, diameter one,\nLips four eights, belly’s navel spread.\nTo refine lead, first stabilize the mind,\nLet Yang-fire surge from below.\nWithout a master’s direct instruction,\nHow shall you grasp the Mysterious pivot?\n\n**Lead and Mercury**\nLead emerges from white gold, mercury from sand.\nAlchemists boast of these as true medicines.\nYet if gold and stone are the genuine cure,\nWhy sow seeds and dance for hemp’s long stalks?\nThe Yellow Male within the Abyss is mercury’s ancestor,\nThe Dark Female in the Flame is lead’s kin.\nDistinguish clearly true from false—\nTrue lead resembles a horse’s tooth.\n\n**Harmonization**\nThe Eight and Two stem from pure, correct One.\nDo not say equal parts mean average balance.\nWhere Yin and Yang harmonize,\nConsult the Child, Midday, and Applicator.\nAt the Hour of the Dragon, use the Hour of the Snake,\nAt the Hour of the Boar, seek the Hour of the Tiger.\nWhen their influences merge into Three and Five,\nThe Central Yellow yields the utmost truth.\n\n**True Soil as True Lead’s Yellow Sprout**\nPrimordial Black is true lead—do not trust deceivers’ claims.\nTen thousand transformations hint at verdant omens,\nOne spirit flees unless restrained.\nFormed substance is not the genuine essence,\nFormless substance alone is the Mysterious.\nTell the Dao-seekers to study diligently—\nDo not mistake common lead for the true.\n\n**Procurement**\nAt midnight, crimson light illuminates the Northern Sea,\nA single gold elixir grain—perfect, round.\nWithout knowing how to gather, you miss the profound,\nWasting your ascent into the Celestial Clarity.\nThe crane’s wings stiffen with frost,\nThe toad’s fat thrives on moonlight’s glow.\nRelying on qi’s resonance, the sword is wielded—\nSeized upon the palm, the moment arrives.\n\n**Ritual Setup**\nBuild the altar in three tiers: Heaven, Earth, Man.\nArrange the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams evenly.\nSuspend the mirror above and below to command spirits,\nArray the sword at the four cardinals to subdue demons.\nWith the Step of Yu, the Three Realms fall silent,\nStars appear as fingers point—hundreds of spirits gather.\nChime the clepsydra without error,\nEvery moment’s labor blooms into aeons of spring.\n\n**Assistants**\nAides must harmonize in voice and purpose—\nThree minds as one, mutually supporting.\nThe leader sits first, overseeing the cauldron’s arrangement,\nThe assistant attends to furnace and tools.\nVerify the cauldron’s lead and mercury—dragon and tiger leap.\nAdjust the qi and climate, both martial and civil.\nClarify beginning and end,\nRely on the disciples to call out precisely.\n\n**Ingesting the Elixir**\nSeizing the Yellow Sprout in your palm,\nSwiftly swallow—do not delay.\nMercury’s mist envelops your body,\nLead’s yang captures the spirit like a bird in a cage.\nLonging for reunion is no different from a child seeking its mother,\nHarmony mirrors male meeting female.\nRefine the fire’s timing with utmost care,\nA ten-month gestation yields boundless life.\n\n**The Nine Cauldrons**\nThe elixir’s secret art transcends mortals,\nSix hundred verses name the Nine Methods.\nYu’s model terrified the deceitful,\nThe Yellow Emperor’s casting perfected the Dao.\nTiming must align with the alchemists’ laws,\nAfter ingestion, avoid carrion’s stench.\nSeasons shift in cycles, returning anew,\nWhen refined, the dragon’s form comes to welcome.\n\n**Igniting the Fire**\nAt the Hour of the Child, ignite; at the Hour of the Geng, conceal—\nThis is the morning’s fire-ignition chapter.\nRespond to Yin and Yang in silent accord,\nRegulate breath’s inflow and outflow with gentle persistence.\nTwo hundred sixteen hexagrams,\nCoinciding with *Complexion*, *Central Peace*, *Great Achievement*, and *Heaven*.\nThe clepsydra must not falter—timing is precise,\nFlames blaze as the red lotus unfurls.\n\n**Retreating the Fire**\nAt the Hour of the Horse, one hundred forty-four stars—\nThis is the Yin-Symbol’s fire-retreat sequence.\nTame the ice’s rigidity from the outset,\nConceal and store as Earth reaches fullness.\nGeneral effects only increase abundance,\nThe Two Qi’s division shows decay and flourishing.\nReduce the fire, retreat the symbol—Heaven and Earth grow still,\n*Layered* and *Young Growth* hexagrams govern creation.\n\n**Adding and Drawing**\nEach cycle of fire-ignition brings Yang’s return—\nDragon and Tiger spiral, crimson light radiates.\nYin’s shadow and lead hide with the sun’s decline,\nYang’s spirit and mercury thrive with the times’ favor.\nHandle the ash’s essence with utmost caution,\nImpatience invites disaster like the hare’s peril.\nDraw lead, add mercury—fire alone suffices,\nBeyond this, no other method exists.\n\n**Returning to the Primordial**\nForm and spirit both perfect—Dao’s disciples,\nNature and life united with the Great Void.\n\n**Divine Edict and Ascension**\n\nWhen the precious edict descends, the crane-drawn chariot soars,\nAfter bowing to the jade scroll, the dragon-carriage ascends.\nCelestial officials gleam in splendor—who dares compare their rank?\nIn this turbid age, I endure the cauldron’s torment, dwelling like a hare.\n\nAccumulate virtue, diligently seek—meeting is inevitable.\nTell me, why do you still hesitate?\n\n**Returning to the Primordial**\nSouth is non-South, East is non-East,\nOne essence, wondrously complete, inherently boundless.\n\nThe wise and the vulgar differ not in essence,\nSaint and commoner share the same source.\n\nCall red \"crimson\" by nature’s habit,\nName \"Mother\" as \"Mama\"—sharp as a whetstone’s edge.\n\nAll conditioned things are ultimately unreal,\nAwaken to the true source—void yet not void.\n\n**Alchemical Practice**\nThe Water Male and Fire Female,\nThese are the Yellow Sprouts’ sovereigns—\nHeaven and Earth’s primordial seeds,\nThe ancestral roots of the Five Phases.\n\nEqual parts in one *dou* measure,\nFrom the eighth month, count anew.\nWhen the moon reaches fullness,\nOne Yang arises at midnight’s peak.\n\n*Taiji* qi swirls in mist,\nLured by the Holy Mother’s grace,\nSeated at the North Star’s apex, masculine power revealed,\nThe altar rises three tiers high.\n\nDragon and Tiger spiral in flight,\nFollowing the celestial cycles’ law,\nThe elixir cauldron glows with sudden light,\nA single millet-grain pearl hangs suspended.\n\nSwiftly gather it as it comes,\nSwallow whole—do not chew.\n\nWhen the soul-elixir enters the belly,\nMists disperse like wind and rain.\nThe Four Seas churn in waves,\nHeaven and Earth’s essence and spirit settle.\n\nYang fire and Yin talisman,\nMove in perfect harmony, no error.\nBathing must be done with utmost caution,\nDrawing and adding require vigilant protection.\n\nNine cauldrons refine the cycle,\nThe River Vehicle meets no obstruction.\nGolden liquid descends as jade nectar,\nThe infant sheds its mortal shell.\n\nTen months of toil complete,\nForm and spirit grow wings.\nThe Daoist does not seek—\nOnly the side paths deceive.\n\nSide-path methods mislead—\nExamine them carefully before embracing.\n\nThis alchemical practice,\nI speak of it no more.\n\n**Warning to the Misled**\nLong life may be learned, the Ultimate Way transmitted—\nTo the worthy, reveal it not;\nTo the unworthy, speak not.\n\nIn this muddled age, entangled by fame and gain,\nLife flees like flowing water—who would still seek immortality?\nOnly those who study\nGain but partial truths:\nFeasting on mist, inhaling qi,\nSitting in meditation, chanting sutras.\n\nRefine one’s bodily Yin,\nBurn eight stones to ash,\nThree secret methods, six static extensions.\nDragon and Tiger manifest,\nGhosts and spirits appear before you.\nMorning dew yields the great medicine,\nAutumn stone in urine’s stream.\n\nGrasses and trees reverse their aging,\nEssences return to their source.\nSuction and prohibition techniques,\nGathering and governing Yin energies.\n\nClear the intestines, abstain from grains,\nAvoid markets, shun the dust.\nFar gather the Five *Zhi* herbs,\nNear cultivate the Three Fields.\n\nThe Four Fruits of the Dao,\nThe Ten Great Scriptures,\nGolden grains of trust,\nJade flasks of *Hunyuan*.\n\nSmall *Pian* seven-two,\nGreat *Pian* two-four.\n\nAll these Daoist guardians,\nTen thousand herbs and roots,\nMislead those who cling—\nClaiming precision in their pursuit.\n\nSmall hopes for mere longevity,\nGreat desires to ascend to Heaven,\nBefore white hair appears,\nThey are already recorded in the Yellow Springs.\n\nThey blame not their own errors,\nComplain the Way lacks mercy,\nCausing the earnest to falter,\nTheir path left in confusion.\n\nWith such methods seeking longevity,\nLike crossing to Hu or Yue,\nRetreating from the Central Plains.\nHunting fish in green waters,\nChasing hares to dry the rivers.\n\n「Yet seeking the Way through false methods,\nDeeply pitiable—thus I recount the *Yinzheng* to welcome future sages.\n\nThe ancient immortals do not reveal themselves outright,\nYet all their oral precepts are proclaimed.\n\nLamenting the bitter sea of suffering,\nSilent in lonely quest like climbing a ladder to Heaven,\nTeachers and masters are hard to find—\nPlanting virtue must come first.\n\nPerhaps this may inspire and awaken,\nSo that the sincere may attain their true aspirations.\n\nReading this, one may gain insight,\nUnlocking Heaven’s full essence,\nWhen the work is complete and the Dao fulfilled,\nVanishing into the misty halls of the clouds.\n\nAs honored guests of the Jade Emperor,\nHolding the pivot of transformation’s authority,\nMindful of this very moment,\nDiligently striving both day and night.\n\nLater, my teacher—when he was still a child—once said:\n*\"In Lu, I heard of your master, the nameless child, who sought Master Cloud: My master is indeed the Suiyi *Zhi*ren, Suiyi the son of Master Shunli. Together with Master Wutian, he studied at the *Piyong* Academy, yet never passed the imperial examinations. From early youth, he nurtured a divine root, and when he pursued the Dao, the Dao responded to him.*\n\nLater, when he remembered his fellow Daoists had descendants, during the *Shuowu* year of Shaoxing, he met Master Wutian and received his teachings, thus attaining the Dao.\n\nUnable to fulfill his aspirations, he then annotated *Pangzhenren’s* *Shantongqi Yishu*, hiding in the marketplace, yet still guiding others.\n\nWhen he harmonized with like-minded souls, in the *Buanjixu* year of Qiandao, he attained the Dao beneath Tiger Hill, reaping the grace of immortals and mistakenly claiming their favor.\n\nDuring Shaoxing’s reign, at the *Zhijiang Kuapu* Bridge, he was refined by *Pangzhenren’s* countenance, his inherent talents and resources yet unfulfilled. Day and night, he labored anxiously, already surpassing three decades.\n\nOnce, on the Mid-Autumn Festival, he expressed his feelings:\n*\"Mid-Autumn holds Heaven’s secrets in my grasp—\nEach year on this night, my sorrow knows no bounds.\nThree persons mastered the divine arts,\nTwo eights refined the *Hunyuan* essence of millet.\nTo trust the Dao, one must seek a blessed land,\nYet the Crane knows—ascend to Yangzhou.\nWho can lend me the *Fuxiao* wind’s swift aid,\nSo that I may rise with them to the Ten Isles?\nMy resolve is clear—see how vast it is!\nThus, be diligent, all of you!\"*\n\nAnd so he imparted the Dao,\nIn truth during the *Gengxu* year of Chunxi.\n\nThough alchemical formulas were not yet fully revealed,\nHe would later point them out.\n\nIn the *Gengshen* year, he again met Master Lu, the temple clerk, in Suzhou,\nAnd only then disclosed the secrets—\nFor Master Lu was also among those Suiyi had instructed.\n\nI have studied the Dao for thirty years,\nAnd in the *Gengzi* year of Jiading,\nEncountered the immortal master,\nWho then fully revealed the alchemical secrets to me atop Tiger Hill.\n\nNow, just two years later,\nYet I am still constrained by petty officials,\nBuried in dusty labor—\nFearful that later generations may follow blindly,\nDrowning in mundane pursuits and abandoning the Dao.\nThus, I compose this *Huandan Yinzheng* Diagram,\nHoping it may serve as a guide for them!\n\nIn days past, Master Xu of the Western Mountains,\nOn the day he slew the serpent,\nLeft these words: *\"After my ascension,\nA thousand two hundred and forty years hence,\nWithin the Five Tombs’ domain,\nEight hundred shall attain immortality.*\nFrom the *Shujin Yongjia* era to our Song *Chunxi* reign,\nThe count has already been fulfilled.\n\nThus I reflect—\nWithin the Five Tombs today,\nThose who are truly devoted and resolute,\nAll possess the potential for immortality.\nThis work is not without purpose!\n\nOn the third day of the Winter Solstice,\nI recorded the lineage’s origins here.\n\n**Postscript to the *Huandan Yinzheng* Diagram:**\n\nI once heard the alchemical precepts from my true master,\nYet those who sought their validation in scriptures were many!\nIf they are not profound yet obscure,\nThen they are shallow and scattered—\nHow difficult to discern!\n\nOnce, I obtained a scroll of *Longmeizi Yinzheng* Diagram,\nWhich I carefully preserved.\nObserving its methods of refining medicines,\nNurturing the embryo to transcend its shell,\nThe gradual stages of cultivation—\nLike ascending steps, one by one.\nIn a single glance,\nThe essence of alchemy and its scriptural alignment became clear to me.\n\nOnly the transmission’s order remains unclear:\n*Longmeizi* was the ancestor teacher,\nYet the *Yinzheng* lineage’s second and third masters remain unknown.\nFor ancient sages often wrote under pseudonyms,\nAs seen in works like *Huoji* and *Longhu Jing*.\n\nNow, examining the preface and its details,\nOne recognizes it as the lineage of *Ziyang* Master.\nThe inscription further states:\n*\"My teacher, the nameless child, was Master Cloud’s disciple.\nMy teacher’s master was Suiyi, the son of Master Liu Zhenren—\nLiu Zhenren, the White Dragon Grotto recluse,\nWas indeed a disciple of Ziyang.\nSuiyi was his sobriquet.*\n\nIt is said that Ziyang departed in the fifth year of Yuanfeng,\nAnd seven years later, Suiyi met him at Wangwu Mountain,\nComposing verses to inspire each other’s resolve.\nThere were words of Ziyang hearing of his knowledge of medicines.\n\nThough Suiyi heard the Dao yet lacked the strength to fulfill it,\nIn the *Shuowu* year of Shaoxing,\nHe again met Ziyang,\nAnd completed his aspirations in the *Buanjixu* year of Qiandao,\nLiving beyond a hundred years,\nThen finally soaring upward.\n\nThe one who inscribed the diagram’s title, Master Wang Qidao,\nWas the Golden Toad Child,\nA descendant of the Jade Toad Immortal.\n\nSince he honored *Longmeizi* as his ancestral teacher,\nThe traces of *Longmeizi* are indeed hidden yet evident.\nHis ultimate attainment of the Dao\nNeed not be spoken—it is known.\n\nNow, to observe his steadfast resolve,\nTo emulate the profound and thirst for the mysterious,\nYet the difficulty of attainment\nShall follow the path of Suiyi’s master!\n\nAlas!\nOne need not fear the difficulty of studying the Dao,\nBut rather the difficulty of hearing it.\nOne need not fear hearing the Dao’s difficulty,\nBut rather the difficulty of attaining it.\n\nThus, many study like cow’s hair,\nFew grasp it like a horn’s tip.\nI often sigh at the ancient weariness—\nIf one has resolve, the task will be accomplished,\nWhat is there to fear?\n\nOn the day when my cultivation is complete,\nI shall fly beyond the Eight Trigrams,\nVisit *Longmeizi’s* second and third disciples\nIn the land where the *Hunfeng Yunlei* winds blow,\nRecord their Daoist conduct for posterity,\nAnd descend to guide those in the lower realms.\nThe world shall then add to the *Lianxian Zhuan*.\n\nIn the *Jizixu* year of *Jiazi*,\nOn the day when the Golden Essence fills the cauldron,\nThe *Yuntai Xuan Shi*, Master Yuan Yang,\nAscended from the tranquil forests of *Huxing*.\nBlack Jade knelt to receive the scriptures\nAt the *Tawei Xuangai* Celestial Hall,\nA youth of thirty-five years.\n\nThe *Huandan Yinzheng* Diagram is complete.»",

Composed by Longmeizi, from the Southern Song.\nSource text: *Zhengtong Daozang* (Orthodox Daoist Canon), *Dongzhen* (Cavern of the Perfect) section, *Lingtu* (Numinous Diagrams) category.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Golden Elixir Reversion Alchemy Verification Diagram**\nComposed by Longmeizi:\n\n*\"I once exchanged death for life through alchemical refinement—\nMy name was inscribed on jade tablets, yet remained obscure.\nSeeking a master and pursuing the Dao,\nMy heart found harmony only in the alchemical scriptures.\n\nGood and evil lie within the self;\nAscension and decline depend on one’s own efforts.\n\nObserving the *Total Immortals* tradition,\nI learned that from antiquity onward,\nTen thousand have ascended in spirit,\nEight thousand have relocated their dwellings.\nWas this solely due to innate endowment?\nOr did they achieve it through diligent practice?\n\nIf Huangdi was born divine and spiritually luminous,\nIt was by Heaven’s bestowal.\nYet if Jingyang refined his Dao to perfection,\nWas it not through human effort?\n\nOne must await the exhaustion of evil karma\nBefore virtuous transformation takes root.\n\nSome encountered the Dao while guarding the pass,\nOthers while crossing the sea,\nSome through trials with demons grew only firmer in resolve,\nOthers endured tests without faltering in aspiration.\nObtaining it was arduous, yet cultivation demanded precision—\nRefining in the grand halls of Hongdu,\nRetreating beneath Taihua and Songshan.\n\nSome dispersed in the red dust of the world,\nLike Li Tao’s eight hundred or Anqi’s three thousand.\nOthers soared in broad daylight,\nLike Zixia’s phoenix flight or Qin Gao’s control of the turtle.\nSome loathed the world and achieved *shixie* (corpse dissolution),\nOthers remained in the world while preserving their form,\nSome master-disciple pairs ascended together,\nOthers saw ancestral and descendant lines all attain transcendence.\n\nSome found it difficult to obtain but easy to perfect,\nOthers found it easy to obtain but difficult to perfect.\nThe records are complete—\nNo exaggeration can be added.\n\nFrom childhood, I devoted myself to the pursuit of emptiness and purity,\nSeeking widely among schools, unable to distinguish truth from falsehood.\nFor three generations, I studied under a hundred masters,\nYet all my learning came only after profound awakening.\nHow could such rare matters be achieved with ease?\n\nTo ride the crane in leisurely flight,\nOne must first gather the alchemical funds.\nThe vulgar scoff at this,\nWhile the sage remains silent.\n\nA misstep of a hair’s breadth\nCan lead to a thousand-li error.\nIf Heaven’s secrets are carelessly revealed,\nThe lineage’s guilt will extend to posterity,\nAnd the untransmitted Dao will weigh heavily upon me.\n\nI hesitated to speak, yet could not desist.\nIf the mysteries are hidden in the profound,\nWhy not lay out their broad outlines?\n\nThus, I recorded my master’s teachings\nAnd illustrated them in diagrams.\nThe **Nine Chapters of External Alchemy** exhaust the subtleties of elixir crafting.\nThe **Nine Chapters of Internal Alchemy** detail the nurturing of the elixir.\n\nThe alchemist must have a source—\nThus, there is the **Original Foundation**.\nWith the foundation comes generation—\nThus, there is **Heaven and Earth**.\nUsing Heaven and Earth for refining—\nThus, there are **cauldrons and vessels**.\nThe vessels hold medicinal substances—\nThus, there is **lead and mercury**.\nLead and mercury must be measured precisely—\nThus, there is **harmonization**.\nHarmonization produces the **yellow sprout**—\nThus, there is **true soil**.\nThe alchemical adept values extraction—\nThus, there is **collection**.\nThe process follows established methods—\nThus, there is **regulation**.\nCrafting requires like-minded companions—\nThus, there is **assistance**.\n\nThis pertains to **External Alchemy**,\nIllustrating the **Nine Chapters of Alchemical Force**.\n\nAfter collection, one must ingest the elixir—\nThus, there is **elixir ingestion**.\nUpon completion, one must temper and nourish—\nThus, there are the **Nine Cauldrons**.\nNourishment relies entirely on fire—\nThus, there is **fire progression**.\nFire has phases of advance and retreat—\nThus, there is **fire retreat**.\nAdvance and retreat follow medicinal symbols—\nThus, there is **withdrawal and addition**.\nAdvance and retreat require rest—\nThus, there is **bathing**.\nAfter bathing, the elixir is complete—\nThus, there is the **Golden Elixir**.\nThough the elixir is formed, the nature may not yet be perfected—\nThus, there is **embracing the Primordial**.\nGuarding the One and embracing the Primordial,\nLife is secured, nature penetrates,\nThe form ascends to Heaven’s gate,\nAnd one attains the rank of True Person—\nThus, there is **Returning to the Primordial**.\n\nThis pertains to **Internal Alchemy**,\nThe **Nine Chapters of Elixir Nurturing**.\n\nOnce elixir ingestion is complete,\nOne must temper the fire for a year,\nPiercing the interplay of yin and yang,\nContracting and conserving the seasons,\nPlundering **27,360,000** units of vital *qi*,\nAnd returning to the **913,724,680** treasures of the宝.\nThus, lifespan becomes boundless,\nAnd though the allotted span may decay,\nOne must harmonize self and other,\nMerge color and emptiness,\nAwaken to the naturalness of the Primordial,\nAnd attain the true awareness of the source.\n\nIn motion, one plays in ease;\nIn stillness, one enters the Great Void,\nAchieving the vehicle of no obstruction,\nAnd eternally returning to the original source.\n\nUniting past enlightenment with future return,\nThis makes **twenty chapters** in total.\n\nAppended are **Four and Five Companions’ External Alchemy Practices**,\nTo connect beginning and end,\nInterweave the text,\nAnd guide the lost.\nThus, one may distinguish truth from falsehood,\nAnd separate true adepts from false scholars.\n\nPlaced at the end for careful study,\nThis is not meant as a model for the accomplished,\nBut as a verification for later learners.\n\nComposed on the first day of the eleventh month, *Gengyin* (戊寅) of the *Jiawu* (甲午) year of *QingSong Jia定* (嘉定),\nBy Longmeizi.\n\n---\n**The Golden Elixir Reversion Alchemy Verification Diagram**\nThis diagram was personally received by my predecessor, Yuxian,\nAs a handwritten original from the ancestral master, Longmeizi.\n**Do not show this to others.**\nTreasure it!\nCherish

knows—ascend to Yangzhou.\nWho can lend me the *Fuxiao* wind’s swift aid,\nSo that I may rise with them to the Ten Isles?\nMy resolve is clear—see how vast it is!\nThus, be diligent, all of you!\"*\n\nAnd so he imparted the Dao,\nIn truth during the *Gengxu* year of Chunxi.\n\nThough alchemical formulas were not yet fully revealed,\nHe would later point them out.\n\nIn the *Gengshen* year, he again met Master Lu, the temple clerk, in Suzhou,\nAnd only then disclosed the secrets—\nFor Master Lu was also among those Suiyi had instructed.\n\nI have studied the Dao for thirty years,\nAnd in the *Gengzi* year of Jiading,\nEncountered the immortal master,\nWho then fully revealed the alchemical secrets to me atop Tiger Hill.\n\nNow, just two years later,\nYet I am still constrained by petty officials,\nBuried in dusty labor—\nFearful that later generations may follow blindly,\nDrowning in mundane pursuits and abandoning the Dao.\nThus, I compose this *Huandan Yinzheng* Diagram,\nHoping it may serve as a guide for them!\n\nIn days past, Master Xu of the Western Mountains,\nOn the day he slew the serpent,\nLeft these words: *\"After my ascension,\nA thousand two hundred and forty years hence,\nWithin the Five Tombs’ domain,\nEight hundred shall attain immortality.*\nFrom the *Shujin Yongjia* era to our Song *Chunxi* reign,\nThe count has already been fulfilled.\n\nThus I reflect—\nWithin the Five Tombs today,\nThose who are truly devoted and resolute,\nAll possess the potential for immortality.\nThis work is not without purpose!\n\nOn the third day of the Winter Solstice,\nI recorded the lineage’s origins here.\n\n**Postscript to the *Huandan Yinzheng* Diagram:**\n\nI once heard the alchemical precepts from my true master,\nYet those who sought their validation in scriptures were many!\nIf they are not profound yet obscure,\nThen they are shallow and scattered—\nHow difficult to discern!\n\nOnce, I obtained a scroll of *Longmeizi Yinzheng* Diagram,\nWhich I carefully preserved.\nObserving its methods of refining medicines,\nNurturing the embryo to transcend its shell,\nThe gradual stages of cultivation—\nLike ascending steps, one by one.\nIn a single glance,\nThe essence of alchemy and its scriptural alignment became clear to me.\n\nOnly the transmission’s order remains unclear:\n*Longmeizi* was the ancestor teacher,\nYet the *Yinzheng* lineage’s second and third masters remain unknown.\nFor ancient sages often wrote under pseudonyms,\nAs seen in works like *Huoji* and *Longhu Jing*.\n\nNow, examining the preface and its details,\nOne recognizes it as the lineage of *Ziyang* Master.\nThe inscription further states:\n*\"My teacher, the nameless child, was Master Cloud’s disciple.\nMy teacher’s master was Suiyi, the son of Master Liu Zhenren—\nLiu Zhenren, the White Dragon Grotto recluse,\nWas indeed a disciple of Ziyang.\nSuiyi was his sobriquet.*\n\nIt is said that Ziyang departed in the fifth year of Yuanfeng,\nAnd seven years later, Suiyi met him at Wangwu Mountain,\nComposing verses to inspire each other’s resolve.\nThere were words of Ziyang hearing of his knowledge of medicines.\n\nThough Suiyi heard the Dao yet lacked the strength to fulfill it,\nIn the *Shuowu* year of Shaoxing,\nHe again met Ziyang,\nAnd completed his aspirations in the *Buanjixu* year of Qiandao,\nLiving beyond a hundred years,\nThen finally soaring upward.\n\nThe one who inscribed the diagram’s title, Master Wang Qidao,\nWas the Golden Toad Child,\nA descendant of the Jade Toad Immortal.\n\nSince he honored *Longmeizi* as his ancestral teacher,\nThe traces of *Longmeizi* are indeed hidden yet evident.\nHis ultimate attainment of the Dao\nNeed not be spoken—it is known.\n\nNow, to observe his steadfast resolve,\nTo emulate the profound and thirst for the mysterious,\nYet the difficulty of attainment\nShall follow the path of Suiyi’s master!\n\nAlas!\nOne need not fear the difficulty of studying the Dao,\nBut rather the difficulty of hearing it.\nOne need not fear hearing the Dao’s difficulty,\nBut rather the difficulty of attaining it.\n\nThus, many study like cow’s hair,\nFew grasp it like a horn’s tip.\nI often sigh at the ancient weariness—\nIf one has resolve, the task will be accomplished,\nWhat is there to fear?\n\nOn the day when my cultivation is complete,\nI shall fly beyond the Eight Trigrams,\nVisit *Longmeizi’s* second and third disciples\nIn the land where the *Hunfeng Yunlei* winds blow,\nRecord their Daoist conduct for posterity,\nAnd descend to guide those in the lower realms.\nThe world shall then add to the *Lianxian Zhuan*.\n\nIn the *Jizixu* year of *Jiazi*,\nOn the day when the Golden Essence fills the cauldron,\nThe *Yuntai Xuan Shi*, Master Yuan Yang,\nAscended from the tranquil forests of *Huxing*.\nBlack Jade knelt to receive the scriptures\nAt the *Tawei Xuangai* Celestial Hall,\nA youth of thirty-five years.\n\nThe *Huandan Yinzheng* Diagram is complete.»",
