  "full_translation": "**The Water and Cloud Collection**\n\n*Scripture Title:* *The Water and Cloud Collection*. Composed by Tan Chuduan of the Jin dynasty. Three juan in length. Source text from the *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Taiping Section.\n\n**Preface to The Water and Cloud Collection**\n\nDongmou was an ancient state of the Muzi, a major commandery of Qi. Its households were vast, and its people simple and unadorned. To the east, it bordered the Bohai Sea, where misty waves and surging clouds stretched boundless, extending for tens of thousands of *li*. To the south, it faced the Kun and Jian mountains, their layered peaks towering into the heavens, rising for thousands of *zhang*. With such a convergence of sea and mountain brilliance, the land was blessed with exceptional talent, and eminent figures and scholars emerged in every generation. It was only fitting that perfected beings and immortals would arise in succession.\n\nMaster Tan, styled Chuduan and known as Master Ever-True, hailed from a prominent family of our homeland. From birth, he was keenly perceptive, possessing an extraordinary bearing. Skilled in cursive and clerical script, he was upright and principled, earning the respect and awe of his village. In the *dinghai* year of the Dading era, the Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct and Compassionate Transformation, Chongyang, arrived in the east, his pilgrim’s staff alighting upon the shores. Drawn by past karmic affinities, he sought out old friends. In our homeland, he encountered Master Danyang (Ma), Master Ever-True (Tan), in Donglai Yishui, Master Ever-Living (Liu), and in Dengzhou Qixia, Master Ever-Spring (Qiu). They became a spiritual family beyond the world, known as the Four Masters: Tan, Ma, Qiu, and Liu. Together, they followed the Perfected One’s travels, journeying west to Yimen. There, the Perfected One entrusted them with oral instructions, charged them with future affairs, and then departed this world to ascend as an immortal. After the four completed the burial rites, they led their disciples west to Zhongnan Mountain, the former retreat of the Perfected One. There, they transmitted and inherited his Dao for over a decade. Thereafter, each went their separate ways.\n\nMaster Ever-True wandered along the Luo River, transforming and delivering people through his teachings. Wherever he went, followers gathered like clouds. His compositions—odes, rhapsodies, poems, hymns, and lyrics—flowed effortlessly from his brush, numbering several hundred pieces. He also authored *Recorded Sayings* and *The Song of the Skull’s Liberation*, awakening the world with their warnings. All his works concealed wondrous efficacy, expounding the true wind of the Dao, guiding people toward goodness, and bringing great benefit to the age.\n\nAbbot Wang Liuhui of Quanzhen Hermitage in Junzhou and others carved printing blocks to publish and disseminate his teachings far and wide. In the bingwu year, a great flood swept them away, scattering the blocks and causing their loss. Master Ever-Living of Yishui, Liu, moved by compassion, opened the path of expedient means and dispatched his disciples Xu Shoudao, Li Daowei, and Yu Wuxian to my hometown, entrusting me with a preface. They wished to commission craftsmen anew to carve the blocks and ensure the teachings’ enduring transmission—truly the intent of a benevolent heart.\n\nI once reflected that Master Ever-True and I were from the same village, of similar age and like-minded in youth. As children, we played together; as adults, we traveled as friends. Yet in middle age, he met his teacher, studied the Dao, and shed his mortal form to ascend as a perfected being. Meanwhile, I, with graying temples and hoary hair, still toil in the arena of fame and profit, content to await my end, declining with the world—how foolish I have been!\n\nI shall now cast off my restraints, relinquish the old ox’s love for its calf, and abandon the great rat’s fear of others’ greed. I will roam freely in the realm of self-attainment, laughing and wandering in the realm of true leisure. I will study the Master’s Way, recite his writings, and nurture the harmony of heaven to spend my remaining years. I wonder if, in days to come, the Master might recall our old companionship and deign to lend me his rosy clouds as a sash.\n\nAlas! The Master has already taken flight as an immortal. Later scholars will never witness his steps nor hear his voice. Yet his profound mysteries, wondrous principles, and enduring example remain. By carefully savoring these writings, they may yet grasp them.\n\nOn the full moon of the first month in the dingwei year of the Dading era, this preface was written by Fan Zede Yu, Instructor of Dongmou Prefecture.\n\n*Collected Works of Water and Clouds, Volume One*\nComposed by Master Ever-True of Kunlun Mountain, Tan Chuduan\n\n**Seven-Lawregulated Verses: Inscribed at Chaoyuan Palace in Luoyang**\nThe palace gates stand still, sealed in auspicious mist,\nYet ancient traces and sacred marks remain as if present.\nClouds shroud linked branches where the alchemical cauldron boils,\nRosy dawns rise from the numinous well to irrigate the elixir spring.\nThe sun’s essence refines the land of Huaxu,\nThe moon’s spirit gathers the realm of endless day.\nSince the Purple Edict summoned the Perfected away,\nWho now shall succeed as the Great Luo Immortal?\n\n**Visiting Ling Mountain Temple**\nLeisurely I wander clouds and waters to seek the Chan grove,\nJade-like bamboo glows thickly against emerald peaks.\nThe Jade Pillar Peak stands high, unstained by dust,\nLing Mountain Temple hides where few may find its realm.\nWhite snow blends in even drifts like jade spread,\nGolden blossoms scatter amidst yellow flowers.\nOn an autumn night by the limpid ancient pool,\nOsmanthus blooms alone reveal the original heart.\n\n**Visiting Magistrate Liu’s Garden**\nA host of worthies invites me to admire the fragrant bloom,\nAfter rain clears, I pass alone through the bright gate.\nBy the balustrade, peonies vie in splendor,\nAround the courtyard, butterflies contend in lofty flight.\nThe wind stirs willow eyes with ruthless intent,\nThe rain washes flower hearts clean of right and wrong.\nAll things merge into spring’s single qi,\nSelfless, it scatters its fragrance everywhere.\n\n**Presented to the White-Haired Elder Guo of Xinzhong**\nHow many ever reach the white-haired elder’s state?\nBirth, aging, sickness, and death mark the beginning and end.\nFoul impurities and rank desires shorten lifespan,\nWhile greed and envy turn the mind to darkness.\nLove and hate make transcending the world difficult,\nDesireless and passionless, one attains liberation.\nFortunate that paths to heaven and hell exist—\nSages and fools, delusion and awakening, all rest with you.\n\n**Presented to Immortal Cheng of Yunyang**\nThe greatest fear in cultivation is stubborn bronze,\nFor one clad in stubborn bronze gains no merit.\nWhen the heart stirs with false dust, one sinks to the underworld,\nWhen the mind abides in purity, one walks the celestial palace.\nYou must emulate Yanzi’s joy in poverty,\nNot crave Deng Tong’s wealth and greed.\nLearn from Master Ma of Zhongnan,\nWho dwelt in utter destitution within the ring.\n\n**Presented to Immortal Zheng**\nLeaving the world, he dwells in a hermitage beyond things,\nSilently cultivating, erasing traces, ceasing all debate.\nWondrously he purges filth, delighting in pure poverty,\nUsing clarity to wash away ignorance, content with plainness.\nHis thatched door stands unbarred—what hinders him?\nA single gourd suffices to quench greed.\nCalm and still, he sits in effortless ease,\nPiercing through the three lights of sun, moon, and stars.\n\n**Presented to Young Master Han on Cultivating the Dao at Home**\nUphold truth, initiate goodness, establish the mysterious hall,\nDiligently offer incense morning and evening.\nWithin, serve your widowed mother with filial devotion,\nWithout, uphold integrity to align with the Three Lights.\nAlways act with compassion to lift the poor and distressed,\nFrequently extend mercy to relieve those in misfortune.\nIf one day your wisdom awakens,\nYou too shall return to the immortal realm.\n\n**Presented to Disciples Anranzi and Others**\nThe Master’s subtle words enlighten all,\nDo not idly exhaust qi and spirit.\nTo seek the treasures of the sea’s depths,\nRefine the mountain’s summit to eliminate the slightest flaw.\nThe heart chasing worldly passions harms qi and fire,\nThe mind wandering in craving injures the spirit’s blade.\nI hope you awaken early to the illusory world,\nAnd avoid another cycle in the human realm.\n\n**Presented to the Eighty-Year-Old Daoist Nun Yang**\nSeeking the mysterious, the eighty-year-old Daoist nun Yang,\nA jade-like flower blooming after autumn’s frost.\nHer jade cup brims with water of purity and stillness,\nHer golden censer must glow with fragrant wisdom.\nNow she has secured future blessings,\nHenceforth, what doubt remains of past misfortunes?\nIn the serene and empty hall, free from obstruction,\nThe precious cauldron naturally reveals rosy light.\n\n**Inscribed at Master Kong’s Hermitage**\nThe empty gate stands silent, sealing the numinous spring,\nDelighting in the spring’s profound mystery upon mystery.\nSecluded, it often draws idle visitors,\nIn quietude, it shares its abode with the sleeping phoenix.\nThe cool and pure realm transcends the dusty path—\nOnly by treading here does one know another heaven exists.\nIf the seeker is willing to look in lowly places,\nThey shall suddenly behold the immortal.\n\n**Presented to Marshal Wang of Junzhou**\nNoble Wang delights in the mysterious current,\nUrging me earnestly to invert the jade cup.\nGoodness accumulates gradually from the heart,\nMerit must be sought within one’s nature.\nBenefiting others while diminishing the self reveals true principle,\nEnduring insults with compassion unlocks wondrous depths.\nEquanimity and harmony are the great Dao—\nThree shall ascend together in the divine vessel.\n\n**Inscribed at Yunxi Hermitage**\nAt Yunxi, the recluse lies amidst mist and rosy clouds,\nSilently drinking the sun’s essence and moon’s radiance.\nMists disperse from the cinnabar terrace, revealing auspicious herbs,\nClouds gather around the numinous crucible, forming jade-like blooms.\nThe Azure Dragon exhales fire to brew golden tea,\nThe White Tiger digs springs to irrigate jade sprouts.\nWhen dragon and tiger unite, the work completes nine cycles,\nA single grain of the elixir holds cinnabar’s treasure.\n\n**Expressing My Aspirations**\nI admire poverty and leisure to explore the wondrous mechanism,\nThus knowing my body enters the realm of white clouds.\nCarefree beyond the world, I transcend the dust’s net,\nUnfettered within, I shed the garment of defilement.\nFearing harm to hidden merit, I examine my faults,\nAnxious to avoid moral injury, I shun others’ blame.\nWhen the nine-cycled cinnabar elixir is complete,\nI shall invite the Three Immortals to return with me.\n\n**Again**\nBlunting sharpness, subduing strength, I become good,\nSuddenly both heart and method are forgotten.\nIn the cauldron, the vajra flame frequently rises,\nIn the furnace, the prajna incense perpetually burns.\nThe jade elixir first blooms—only I gather it,\nThe immortal peach ripens—I taste it first.\nDo not say the land of Huaxu is distant,\nIn perfect emptiness, the path is not long.\n\n**Again**\nA single shortcut leads to the immortal source,\nAt the cave’s mouth, numinous clouds veil the verdant peak.\nWhen winds and waves arise, wield the sword of wisdom,\nWhere the mysterious waves settle, pluck the golden lotus.\nThe dragon subdued, it sleeps in the Li palace,\nThe tiger captured, it rests in the Kan chamber.\nWhen these two are pacified, worldly affairs end,\nWith merit complete and conduct fulfilled, the embryonic immortal is born.\n\n**Again**\nLonging for the immortal source’s enduring scenes,\nI purify the numinous land and spread jade-like fragrance.\nThe Red Child of the Southern Palace dwells in the cool hall,\nThe Black Tortoise of the Northern Sea resides in the crimson chamber.\nIn the Pure and Still Grotto, the White Tiger is imprisoned,\nOn the Effortless Mountain, the Azure Sheep are herded.\nSince the clouds gathered within the cauldron,\nI perpetually drink the divine nectar, lying in drunken bliss.\n\n**Again**\nThe Daoist’s home is desolate and free,\nEmbracing weakness, following conditions, passing the years.\nAgainst the cold, coarse robes of paper suffice,\nTo sate hunger, plain rice with greens will do.\nForgetting words, distant from worldly ties,\nAbandoning thoughts, the Dao’s profundity grows.\nThose attached to wives, children, fame, and profit—\nWhen their limits approach, their regrets shall be as thick as hemp.\n\n**Again**\nThe celestial mechanism runs deep, few comprehend it,\nA single grain of the elixir is held at noon.\nMists roll back from the ancient pool on an autumn night,\nClouds gather from the green peaks in the moon’s glow.\nThe dragon is seized and imprisoned in the lofty cauldron,\nThe tiger is captured and bound in the Kan pool.\n\nThe immortal elixir is refined, transcending creation,\nTo hasten to Penglai Isle and pay homage to the true master.\n\n**Again**\nThe wind sighs through pines, rustling and light,\nRoaming beyond the world, one with the immortals.\nThe nature shines like the bright moon flowing through the azure sky,\nThe heart drifts like idle clouds across the boundless blue.\nThe fierce tiger is captured and imprisoned in the Kan gate,\nThe dragon is subdued and bound in the Li palace.\nThe vajra flames rise repeatedly through the celestial cycle,\nForging within the furnace a single crimson grain.\n\n**Again**\nA luminous point illumines the towering terraces,\nClearly realizing non-arising, transcending coming and going.\nOn the Seven Treasures Mountain, the crimson flames are extinguished,\nIn the sacred land of the Three Palaces, the white lotus blooms.\nThe purple court of mist and rosy clouds draws near,\nThe cloud-path to Yingzhou is left behind, never to return.\nWho shares the portion of the never-night Jade Capital?\nThe Four Companions attend the Ever-Spring Immortal.\n\n**Again**\nA green serpent, three feet long, carried in the sleeve,\nA single grain of cinnabar coalesces at the proper hour.\nMists shroud the clear deep, imprisoning the colt,\nSmoke veils the verdant peaks, binding the ape.\nAfter a thousand mornings, the dragon leaps into fire when the work is complete,\nAfter nine revolutions, the tiger enters the pool when the merit is fulfilled.\nSeizing the true creation of emptiness,\nThe celestial mechanism runs deep, few comprehend it.\n\n**Again**\nDesire’s cunning surpasses defilement and idle speech,\nAwakening to this, one departs from all extremes.\nTo sever desire and forget emotion is to grasp the wondrous principle,\nSmoke disperses and fire dies, attaining the profound mystery.\nMouth agape, tongue raised—how can the work be accomplished?\nThoughts arise, heart stirs—how can the path be perfected?\nCutting off worldly ties, nothing remains,\nIn desolate solitude and quiet simplicity, one passes the remaining years.\n\n**Again**\nTrue practice, true conduct, arranged in secrecy,\nTen years of diligent care, nurtured with utmost devotion.\nThe mind forgets worldly realms, transcending the other shore,\nWorldly passions and thoughts perish, arriving at Penglai.\nThe buried treasure-sword’s radiance pierces the Dipper,\nThe pearl hidden in the clam silently nurtures the embryo.\nCultivation must rely on true creation,\nTo fathom creation, refine the heart to ashes.\n\n**For Disciples**\nLeaving the secular home to enter the Daoist’s,\nIs like treading mist and rosy clouds from level ground.\nIn the world of dust, time is fleeting,\nWithin the immortal’s gourd, days and months stretch long.\nThe carefree life of drifting clouds and waters is true livelihood,\nEmptiness and purity are the virtuous way of life.\nConstantly observing desirelessness, worldly ties grow distant,\nUnawares, the great cinnabar coalesces within the furnace.\n\n**Again**\nHold to the One, truly abide, recognizing inner tranquility,\nDiligently and arduously practice, refining the heart to uprightness.\nThe path to the Mystery Origin is not easy,\nYet within the square inch, no dust—this is not difficult.\nIn the twelve hours, remain ever vigilant,\nWithin the three thousand merits, do not deceive or slacken.\nIf you seek the path ahead without coming or going,\nDeeply contemplate the view of no-self, no-person.\n\n**Again**\nSubdue strength, temper sharpness in cultivation,\nExtinguish the self, subdue the heart, sever worldly ties.\nSilently polish, removing cleverness and eloquence,\nDrowsily forge, casting off ferocity and savagery.\nWhere ignorance arises, the true spirit darkens,\nWhen softness and weakness arise, the Dao-eye brightens.\nEach battle with ignorance is waged,\nEach act of endurance is a victory.\n\n**Again**\nEradicate evil, remove passions, act with goodness,\nBest to forget both fame and profit together.\nOn the mountain’s peak, extinguish the fire of ignorance,\nIn the sacred chamber, constantly add the incense of prajna.\nWhen all dust and grime are removed, the bright mirror appears,\nWhen wasteland is cleared, the jade lotus blooms.\nDo not weary of the distant path of cultivation,\nFor the road to emptiness is not long when fully realized.\n\n**Again**\nIn cultivation, one must recognize the spirit’s source,\nRecognizing the spirit’s source, a single point shines fresh.\nPassions and desires forever severed, transcending the dharma realms,\nIgnorance and anger extinguished, departing from heaven and humanity.\nCease the inverted delusion of clinging to existence,\nDo not stir the dusty heart to taint myriad conditions.\nWithin the emptiness and stillness of the nature, no obstructions,\nNaturally, in leisure, the embryo of the person is born.\n\n**Again**\nIn the empty hall, silently burn the heart’s incense,\nThis is the true Daoist sanctuary of my gate.\nEntering emptiness, seek freedom,\nDispelling afflictions, find coolness.\nThe symbols Kan and Li arrange the furnace and hearth,\nThe hexagrams guide the celestial cycle, refining white and yellow.\nEternally, ceaselessly, follow this practice,\nWhen the work is complete, the nine revolutions yield lead frost.\n\n**Again**\nIn cultivation, do not seek within the dharma,\nClinging to dharma in search brings no freedom.\nRecognize that your own heart is the Buddha,\nWhy exhaust yourself in external wanderings?\nThe spirit’s source, wisdom’s illumination—let dust not obscure it,\nIn responding to things, let no thought linger.\nTwo paths of pure wind open the jade gate,\nA single silver stream emerges from the mountain’s peak.\n\n**Self-Reflection**\nFrom the outset, cutting off love to practice austerity,\nHolding to the One, embracing poverty, my resolve unwavering.\nBamboo hat and sheepskin are constant companions,\nTattered felt and a sack ever follow.\nRich mutton and fine wine hold no allure,\nPlain rice and leftover broth suffice to stave off hunger.\nA wooden bowl, newly acquired by begging,\nStill the same as when I first left home.\n\n**Expounding the Dao**\nRoaming beyond the world like a cloud-and-water immortal,\nA single grain of elixir severs worldly ties.\nTrue emptiness coalesces the treasures of the Three Fields,\nWondrous function perfects the five-petaled lotus.\nFire dies, smoke disperses through forging,\nHeart clear, intent still—through single-mindedness.\nCarefree and unrestrained, the eternal true one,\nSailing the boundless prajna boat for ten thousand miles.\n\n**Again**\n\n**Wandering the Cloud-Water Path**\n\nCloud-water wandering, a home wherever I stay,\nCareless of the sun and moon as years slip away.\nIn leisure, wisdom’s waters fill the golden crucible,\nIn stillness, the numinous field sprouts jade shoots anew.\nBeneath the sea, red peonies are nurtured to bloom,\nAtop the mountain, white lotuses form in the blue.\nI now reveal the treasure beyond the dust—\nInherent thusness is itself the great elixir sand.\n\n**Again**\n\nCloud-water wandering, an immortal beyond the world,\nLeisurely and still, the original heaven unfurled.\nPreserving the heart, extinguishing the self to unlock the golden chain,\nDiminishing intent, forgetting passion to break the jade lotus’ stem.\nOn the farther shore, searching for the profound and wondrous,\nWithin the sacred mountain, securing a karmic bond most auspicious.\nWhen the elixir is refined through nine revolutions, a pure breeze carries me,\nLoosening the moorings, the prajna boat drifts free.\n\n**Following the Rhyme of Master Hu Zi Jin**\n\nCultivation is neither easy nor hard to attain,\nBeyond the shallow, nurture the true, and know the inner calm.\nHastily flee the scorching fire pit,\nEarly ascend the cool and serene Dao’s shore.\nConstantly observe desirelessness to penetrate the profound principle,\nMarvelous subtlety lies in emptiness, beyond love and stinginess.\nPurity and non-action depend wholly on resolve,\nPreserve the heart, weaken the self, in stillness and solitude.\n\n**Sent to Master Yao**\n\nRevered by all, Brother Tan stands tall,\nYet entangled in heavy sins within the net’s thrall.\nReflecting on past transgressions, karma lessens its weight,\nBut knowing faults yet persisting, sins accumulate.\nA heart drawn to greed and desire invites disaster’s blow,\nA mind attached to vanity piles sin upon woe.\nDiminish, preserve, humble yourself low,\nWho knows if the sages will deign to bestow?\n\n**Hidden-Head Character Riddles**\n\n**I**\n□Robes of plain cloth weave subtle patterns deep,\n□Armor of metal, golden stems take flight.\n□Qi intermingles, demanding a change of shell,\n□Elixir refined, one dons new raiment bright.\n□Opening the true nature, every turn is right,\n□Awakening to the original, all else is trite.\n□Nephew studies under the master’s alchemy,\n□Four-petaled lotus steps on clouds in flight.\n\n**II**\n□Head surges with a vast and numinous spring,\n□Profound and limpid, it mirrors the heavens above.\n□The Dao demands the severing of passion and desire,\n□Forgetting realms, a thousand merits accrue.\n□Grasp and seize no more, abandon errant quests,\n□Return to the original, unite with nature’s true.\n□Forged into a priceless chamber,\n□Reunion in the capital with the wind-harmed immortal anew.\n\n**III**\n□Upright and serene, following nature’s way,\n□Within, white lotuses bloom in array.\n□Morning forging refines the boundless chamber,\n□Resolute in true cultivation, ascending heaven’s stair.\n□The Dao severs lingering passions, desires cease,\n□The blade cleaves through karmic ties with ease.\n□Do not cling to the numinous source’s thread,\n□The spiritual embryo’s knotting comes first instead.\n\n**Seven-Character Quatrains**\n\n**Roaming Mount Hua**\nCoarse food and patched robes mark the passing years,\nHigh among white clouds, hidden in mist’s embrace.\nHeart’s incense rises from the numinous source,\nIn samadhi, the lotus peak blooms ten feet wide.\n\n**Composed at Qimen Town, Where Daily I Prepare Medicine for the Multitude**\nClever in many arts, yet feigning foolishness,\nIn non-action, guarding the One, nurturing the spirit pearl.\nSuddenly awakened, the dream of toil and dust,\nAlone I drink the wine of no-birth, a single gourd.\n\n**Ode to the Solitary Bamboo**\nA jade-green stalk rises from the fragrant thicket,\nUpright in node, hollow in heart—none compare.\nEnduring snow, defying frost through the years,\nNaturally, from time to time, a pure breeze stirs there.\n\n**Ode to the Moon Osmanthus**\nGreen leaves, supple stems, crimson buds unfold,\nSpirit in every blossom, dancing in the clear wind’s hold.\nWith pine and bamboo, it endures the cold’s test,\nClaiming the year’s glory, the work of creation’s behest.\n\n**Ode to the Crane**\nStill and solitary, facing the autumn wind,\nBlack and white distinct, the work of creation’s hand.\nMarvel not at its thousand-year longevity,\nFor atop its crown, the red elixir is grand.\n\n**The Three Teachings**\nThe three teachings have ever been one family,\nDao and Chan in purity differ not at all.\nConfucius walked upright, penetrating the profound,\nThose who awaken ride the rainbow’s call.\n\n**Expressing My Feelings**\nNot knowing to seek emptiness beyond the external,\nDragons and tigers are tamed, their power inverted.\nLazy in morning and dusk at incense and prayer,\nWithin the twelve hours, only the heart is worshipped there.\n\n**Again**\nDim and silent, profound and abstruse,\nIn purity and non-action, guarding nature’s truth.\nThe true nature congeals, aided by true qi,\nBoundless transformations may pierce the sky’s roof.\n\n**Again**\nNow my cloud-water path is my former vow,\nCarefully observing the eight-line verse I avow.\nTo extend years and increase life’s span,\nRefine the golden essence, recognize true compassion.\n\n**Again**\nOn the twenty-ninth day of the month, I drink,\nA hundred years hold thirty-six thousand scenes.\nUnheard in the world are my affairs,\nReturning, I enter the land of drunkenness.\n\n**Again**\nFormerly reckless, fierce, and coarse,\nToday I preserve my heart, hoping karma’s weight grows less.\nWithin the twelve hours, ever vigilant,\nWho knows if heaven and earth will grant forgiveness?\n\n**Again**\nMoths drawn to the lamp’s flame, unaware of the blaze,\nFish lured by fragrant bait—just the same.\nMoths charred, fish rotted—do you know?\nBetter to dwell in Jetavana’s bough.\n\n**Again**\nMasters Tan, Ma, Qiu, and Liu,\nWandering freely, at ease in their practice true.\n\nThe celestial cycle refines boundless treasures,\nA single radiant light is self-attained.\n\n**Again**\nAncient Buddha’s Lingyan is my home,\nA realm of cool purity, free from sorrow’s moan.\nThe Daoist’s livelihood holds no other task,\nOnly gathering the Three Lights to forge the azure haze.\n\n**Again**\nNow I see through the moth’s love for the flame,\nThe fish lured by bait, playing in dark waves’ game.\nFoul and filthy things at root they be,\nAdorned with guile, they craft illusions cunningly.\n\n**You Huaichuan**\nWith a heart’s source clear, all matters cease,\nBeyond this mystery, what more could one seek?\nA belly vast and round, unstained by dust,\nRoam freely through Huaichuan’s streams at will.\n\n**Again**\nTo govern with pure virtue is to cultivate the Dao,\nLoyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and compassion surpass leaving home.\nHaving walked this path of merit to its end,\nOne shall surely ascend on clouds of radiance.\n\n**Again**\nPlowing cloud-fields across three thousand miles,\nThe moon pierces dusk’s veil o’er a hundred thousand homes.\nIn the clear night, a jade-green pool gleams bright,\nThe clam swallows silver moonlight, birthing cinnabar’s light.\n\n**For Zhang Dianshi**\nA hundred years of time flash by in a blink,\nDiligence in cultivating immortality’s pact—how could one not think?\nEven if one returns as top scholar in triumph grand,\nThe truth dawns: yellow millet’s dream was but a fleeting strand.\n\n**Five-Character Regulated Verse**\n*For the Mother of Master Zhao of Chang’an*\nTeeth and hair reborn in black,\nLongevity’s three causes in her track.\nUtmost sincerity follows the Dao’s friend,\nMeticulous reverence serves the lofty Perfected One.\nA tranquil mind tames the monkey and horse,\nA pure heart gathers qi and spirit’s force.\nWith proper demeanor, I bow in respect,\nKowtowing to the long-lived one I protect.\n\n**Exhortation to Cultivate the Dao**\nHear my method to cleanse the heart,\nIn effortless ease, its savor imparts.\nWithin the formless, wondrous use,\nWithin the formed, inner light infuses.\nPeople are stained by desire’s embrace,\nPassion arises, harming spirit and qi’s grace.\nWhen people sever passion and desire’s chain,\nStep by step, they tread the immortal’s domain.\n\n**Five-Character Quatrain**\n*Exhortation to Cultivate the Dao*\n\n**Studying the Dao**\n\nTo study the Dao, dispel the illusory,\nTo refine the true, empty the void of emptiness.\nThe root returns to one source—\nBright moon and clear wind.\n\n**Again**\n\nWine, lust, anger, and wealth all spent,\nWorries, sorrows, and cares forgotten.\nClinging thoughts and loves severed,\nThe five-petaled jade lotus blooms fragrant.\n\n**Again**\n\nThe Great Dao is ever pure and still,\nIn non-action, it guards the natural.\nIf the heart does not turn back,\nWhere can words transmit it be sought?\n\n**Again**\n\nSitting alone in a ring-shaped hut,\nSolitude’s purity tastes most sweet.\nEffortless, with nothing to do,\nSilently guarding the Three and Three.\n\n**Again**\n\nGathering those *pāramitā* blossoms,\nBrewing them into *prajñā* tea.\nSteeped in water of purity,\nAfter sipping, the yellow sprout appears.\n\n**Again**\n\nEver seeing desire as suffering,\nTiles and pebbles turn to gold.\nSeeing the body as dung and dust,\nThe bright moon shines on jade peaks.\n\n**Again**\n\nWhen the heart is clear and fresh,\nSpeech and silence harmonize spirit and qi.\nPurity dissolves all sins,\nNon-action unbinds all demons.\n\n**Ode to the Dawn Rooster**\n\nIts crow scatters the moon from the city wall,\nCalling forth the sun to rise in the east.\nWondrous, this true virtue—\nAwakening the old man in his dream.\n\n**Admonition on the Brush**\n\nOnly when the brush’s dust is fully shed\nCan the Dao be embraced in wordlessness.\nSplit open the eye of true Dao,\nAnd the false spirit is diminished.\n\n**Hymn**\n\nFirst—\n\nTo learn the Dao and cultivate truth is to go against the world,\nA solitary body drifts like tumbleweed in flight.\nFollowing conditions, let pass and dissolve past transgressions,\nView death as returning—yet never return.\n\nA grimy face and disheveled hair break worldly vigor,\nCoarse robes and plain meals shun luxury and excess.\nEver pure, ever still, acting through non-action,\nIn the twelve hours, silently observe and reflect.\n\n**Second**\n\nGrasping and questioning leave little to say,\nFor originally there is no dharma to transmit.\nOnly when right and wrong are fully extinguished does wondrous communion arise,\nWhen self and others are both forgotten does one awaken to the profound.\n\nPurity, stillness, poverty, and leisure are companions,\nWhile qi, wealth, wine, and sensuality are like sworn enemies.\nIf in this life you wish to ascend the cloud path,\nYou must embrace emptiness—without it, immortality is unattainable.\n\n**Again**\n\nA jeweled hall, exquisite, leans against the azure sky,\nSolemn and compassionate, the sacred image is veiled in auspicious clouds.\nWithin three thousand merits, diligently tend the incense and flame,\nIn the twelve hours, pay homage to the holy countenance.\n\nThe true body is cleansed through tempering,\nThe mist of the numinous cliff disperses for the mysterious wind.\nIn the idle cauldron, where clouds gather,\nA single grain of cinnabar congeals into crimson.\n\n**Again**\n\nFor ten years, ever silent,\nToday the mystery is revealed.\nWater gives birth to the crimson phoenix,\nFire nurtures the black turtle child.\n\nA cool breeze blows atop the mountain peak,\nThe bright moon shines on the cold stream.\nThe demon-subduing divine sword is personally transmitted,\nSeizing the flood dragon by the tail and lifting it.\n\n**Again**\n\nWith a cool heart and warm kidneys, cultivation is attained,\nOnly by awakening to this does one grasp the wondrous mechanism.\nIn the twelve hours, without contrivance,\nThe horse and monkey roam freely, harming the sacred fungus.\n\n**Again**\n\nWho understands the hair swallowing the great sea?\nHow many know the mustard seed containing Mount Sumeru?\nIn daily life, always discern gain and loss,\nWhen merit is complete and conduct fulfilled, bodhi is seen.\n\n**Again**\n\nWine, sensuality, wealth, and qi—one great barrier,\nWhen thoughts and passions are extinguished, one emerges from the dusty world.\nNot even a thread should cling to the numinous source,\nFor if it clings, the elixir will surely fail to form.\n\n**Again**\n\nAfter six years, the fire of ignorance is fully refined,\nAfter ten years, the bone-transforming elixir is perfected.\nIn the serene and empty hall, nothing remains impassable,\nOne knows then how to leap beyond the gate of life and death.\n\n**Again**\n\nFor ten years, I’ve studied like a fool,\nDrifting aimlessly, east and west.\nIf you ask about the wind’s child and the practice of cultivation,\nIt is when the fire dies, face grimy and hair disheveled.\n\n**Again**\n\nA wild crane, a solitary cloud—no companions,\nIn the profound and wondrous, words are forgotten.\nSilent, dim, alone in vigil,\nLimpid as the autumn moon over a cold pool.\n\n**For Xue Balang**\n\nThe numinous being is ever at ease,\nThe borrowed body free from illness.\nPurity and spontaneity,\nNature abides, life endures.\n\n**Again**\n\nSix years on Snow Mountain,\nNine years facing the wall.\nThe Dao is not easily attained,\nTo become Buddha or immortal.\n\n**For Master Mu**\n\nOn the northern slope of Mount Taihua, the venerable immortal Mu,\nDevoted to purity and stillness, explores the profound mystery.\nMending the leakless garden of Jetavana,\nEver-flowing wisdom waters irrigate the heart’s field.\n\nCapturing the monkey, binding the horse atop the emerald peak,\nIn samādhi, no need for the coin to buy mountains.\nAbandoning the mundane, embracing the mysterious, the heart awakens in accord,\nThe causes of good and evil lie in past-life affinities.\n\nIncense of the heart rises from the numinous source,\nVast and obscure, reaching the heavens above.\nThe autumn moon over the jade-green pool is perfectly clear,\nWildflowers and singing birds—mere idle clamor.\n\nIn the cauldron, the fire extinguished, the golden pistil blooms,\nOn the wood, without smoke, the jade lotus forms.\nWhen merits and deeds accumulate to three thousand,\nNature is perfected, the elixir congeals, and one journeys to the origin.\n\n**Song**\n\n**First**\nFormless...\n\nGathering the dark pearl is not with gold or cowrie,\nOn Spirit Mountain, a single trail of fragrant smoke delights.\nPerfumed into the untainted, stepping the deathless path,\nFivefold rosy radiance gathers beneath the wisdom canopy.\n\nThis numinous numinous—everywhere present,\nIts wondrous workings fill empty space, without inside or out.\nWhere nothing exists, all is empty—even emptiness is empty,\nDharmic forms, fruits, and causes all tainted by love.\n\nVariously transcending the three realms’ awakening,\nInstantly like the Thus-Come One’s sudden bright understanding.\nPursuing texts and parsing meanings is but vain toil,\nSpeaking of sages and discoursing on worthies still fabricates strangeness.\n\nNo cultivation to complete, no destruction to suffer,\nWhen realms vanish and the heart is forgotten, contemplation is free.\nLike sands of the Ganges, crystal-clear—then dust and grime,\nEntering and exiting without doubt is the subtlest marvel.\n\nThe lion’s cub, within the Jetavana,\nRoars—what fox dares face it?\nBefore the Bright Moon Hall, jade pistils fragrant,\nIn misty fusion, the golden lotus assembly forms.\n\nDismissing cleverness, dispelling sharp wit,\nOriginally self-possessed—what need to purchase?\nFrom the mountain’s head, vast and surging, the numinous spring wells,\nWashing out empty space, leaving no trace of attainment or denial.\n\nMeeting Chongyang, the teachings clarified,\nNeither advancing nor retreating.\nSince entering the wondrous and recognizing poverty and leisure,\nOne knows the extinction of past sins.\n\nCeasing debate, abandoning knowledge and understanding,\nConcealing radiance, appearing as darkness and obscurity.\nLet sun and moon rush busily on,\nWhile here, following conditions, this skin-bag is lodged.\n\n**Second**\n**The Skull**\n\nSkull, skull—ugly in countenance,\nOnly for in life’s love of flowers and wine.\nArtful smiles, light robes, and willful joy,\nFlesh and blood, skin and muscle gradually decay.\n\nGradually decaying, still craving,\nGreed for wealth, leakage—uncontrollable.\nDesire without end, the body finite,\nUntil today, becoming a skull.\n\nBecoming a skull—you, listen well:\nThe seven-jeweled human body is not easily made.\nYou must understand life and destiny like a hanging thread,\nCasually do not follow human sentiments.\n\nThus I present this image to you,\nSee if today you awaken or not.\n\n**Third**\n**The Fallen One**\n\nI am fallen, I am fallen,\nMy whole body clad in paper and cloth.\nWaving my hand as I walk, all things forgotten,\nDelighted in this body, empty and alone.\n\nWhen hungry, I seek; when weary, I sleep,\nOriginally dwelling in the cool and clear land.\nThe wisdom sword gleams, seizing the sun’s light,\nCountless demonic forces all kept far away.\n\nDelighting in true leisure, achieving true interest,\nThe crooked path’s desolation—I do not go.\nThe true numinous, upright, gradually becomes clear,\nTranscending, I walk the misty and rosy path.\n\nAttaining true cultivation, thoroughly completing,\nWhen truly obtained, there is nothing to say.\nThe crystal palace abides in tranquil ease,\nSeeing through spring flowers and autumn moon.\n\nAgain—\nI am fallen, I am fallen,\nRagged cloth always thus worn.\nFreely drifting beyond the world,\nEverywhere empty, with no reliance.\n\nSometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the city,\nUnskilled in talismans or selling medicines.\nWhen hungry, I wander door to door for a coin,\nWhen sated, all things are equally let go.\n\nAbiding in leisure, without use or action,\nHuman sentiments—fine threads to be pared away.\nDragon and tiger, infant and maiden—all unattainable,\nSilently savoring the pure ghee.\n\nNot doing good, not generating evil,\nSitting, lying, coming, going—empty and alone.\nA heart of pure leisure and cool indifference,\nLet the four great elements drift as they will.\n\nSevering the mechanisms of the passions, without calculation,\nNo hope to ride clouds or mount cranes.\nCarefree and at ease, delighting in poverty and leisure,\nWinning the freedom to follow conditions in peace.\n\n**Following Master Danyang’s Rhyme on the Topknot**\n\nBell-companions, Haichan as ancestral founder,\nStriking the jade bell, sounding the golden drum.\nPiercing through the central point of brightness,\nThe numinous youth leaps out, dancing west.\n\nI feign foolishness, yet not foolishness,\nFoolish talk conceals what is not foolish.\nTrue words, without flattery,\nUtterly free of dust, mechanisms, and cares.\n\nLifting the Li male, leading the Kan female,\nGuiding the Yellow Dame to wander the Pure Land.\nAbiding and walking, sitting and sleeping,\nSometimes wrapped in felt, sometimes in paper quilts,\nQuietly, clearly—always thus.\n\nHalf like a fool, half like a dandy,\nWithin foolishness and dandyism, still self-aware.\nSuch tidings few know,\nA taste of pure emptiness and tranquil blandness suits best.\n\nJoy is anger, anger is joy,\nInversion—originally I am you.\nThrough a thousand trials and ten thousand refinements, seeing the original,\nClearly, clearly—only when the heart is fully understood.\n\n**Record of Teachings for Disciples**\n\nAll people revolve in birth and death without cease,\nOnly because of the heart.\nMaster Deshan said: When the heart arises, myriad dharmas arise; when the heart ceases, myriad dharmas cease. If a single thought does not arise, then one transcends birth and death.\nWhat is the heart?\nIt is because sentient beings possess the three poisons of greed, anger, and delusion, and the heart of ignorance.\nThe Master said: Leaping out of the three mountains’ mouth—this is it.\nThose who awaken thus cultivate,\nSevering emotions and loves, breaking strength and blunting sharpness,\nSubduing and extinguishing the unwholesome hearts of sentient beings,\nTo see the true nature before the original parents’ birth,\nThe original face.\n\nWhat is the unwholesome heart?\nOn every realm, the arising of the ignorant heart,\nVulgar greed, jealousy, lust for wealth and beauty,\nVarious calculations, thoughts arising and ceasing without end.\nBound by these karmic obstructions, familiar realms of old,\nThe true source is obscured, liberation unattained.\nTo extinguish them completely is to see one’s own nature.\n\nHow is seeing one’s own nature named?\nIn the twelve hours, thought after thought, pure and still,\nUnobscured by all illusory, familiar realms of old love,\nThe true source unclouded,\nAlways abiding as empty space,\nCarefree and at ease,\nNaturally, spirit and qi harmoniously unite.\nIn cultivation, if this one matter is understood,\nWhat birth and death are there to fear,\nWhat sins and obstructions to dread?\n\nIf even slightly a thought arises, not pure and still,\nIt is an obstruction within, not called freedom—\nHow can one arrive?\nOnly if all of you are single-minded as a mountain,\nUnmoving, unshaken,\nPressing forward, encountering great demons,\nExhausting this one life,\nNever looking back,\nThe former vow will surely be fulfilled.\n\nMaster Jin said:\nA pure heart and settled intent—the path to heaven,\nA scattered heart and confused intent—the gate to hell.\n\n**The Upper Volume of *Shuiyun Ji* Concludes**\n**The Middle Volume of *Shuiyun Ji***\n**Composed by Tan Chuduan, the Long-Truth Master of Kunlun Mountain**\n\n**Lyrics: Seven *Leijiang Yue* (*Niannujiao*)**\n\nOur school’s three patriarchs—Zhong and Lü, and Hai Chan—\nTransmitted the profound mysteries.\nMaster Chongyang passed down wondrous words,\nLifting us together beyond the Three Isles.\n\nSlowly we seek the true,\nNurturing the numinous root,\nGradually sprouting the yellow sprout of grass.\nWithin the nothingness, there is yet something—\nThe wind of wisdom now bears glad tidings.\n\nA single point, luminous and boundless,\nTraversing the sands of the world,\nEach thing perfectly bright and clear.\nAll varieties of emptiness return to fundamental being,\nInside and out, all inverted and reversed.\n\nThis principle is deep and subtle,\nClear and void, ethereal and distant—\nThe practitioner must arrive.\nIn dim stillness, in silent obscurity,\nEven the wise and sagely know the Way in darkness.\n\n**Again**\nThe Dao of nature,\nEndowed with the primordial root,\nGathers the true and perfect spirit.\nA single point of numinous light, without inside or out,\nBright and penetrating, radiant through the gate of mystery.\n\nStillness and simplicity are most fitting,\nPoverty and leisure are best—\nA carefree place beyond the world.\nEver undimmed,\nAbiding serene in the chamber of spirit.\n\nNo matter how wondrous and unfathomable,\nOne must rely on resolve,\nFirmly securing the primordial yang.\nDiligently refine the celestial true,\nEverywhere turning back to contemplate.\n\nThe lotus blooms within fire,\nThe flame on the mountain’s peak extinguishes—\nTruly, the cause of their meeting.\nThe Wind Immortal reunites,\nTogether roaming the cloud paths of the Three Isles.\n\n**Again**\nThe one numinous true nature—\nWhy did it drift into the mortal womb, the dusty realm?\nSeduced by floating splendor, clinging to love,\nTurning and turning, the true trace grows dim.\nFor kalpas uncounted, it could not escape;\nNow once more it errs,\nPiling sin upon sin.\nThe original form—\nHow can it be discerned and sought?\n\nOne must still both seeing and hearing,\nAbandon emotions like clouds and water,\nBeyond the world, seek the profound principle.\nIn lonely solitude, pure and wondrous,\nWho would care for a withered, toiling body?\n\nSeizing the whirlwind,\nResplendent and radiant,\nSilently refining the golden liquid.\nThe divine elixir shines forth—\nBirth and death, afflictions and cares, all cease.\n\n**Again**\nThe jade flower gradually unfolds,\nUrged by the pure wind,\nGathering the radiant light of golden lotuses.\nThrough kalpas of delusion, all is illuminated,\nStraight through the gate of non-doing.\n\nSeven returns of the light,\nThreefold emptiness awakened and illumined,\nAmidst the golden flowers’ intervals.\nDiligently refined,\nNaturally, the infant and maiden abide.\n\nThis subtle, wondrous truth—\nFrom the moment one begins,\nThe foundation is eternally firm.\nThe lotus forms its jade fragrance, the numinous orchid grows,\nDeeply moved by compassion’s frequent regard.\n\nWithin the tripod, clouds gather;\nIn the furnace, the elixir congeals—\nAfter nine transformations, they meet again.\nFollowing the master’s cloud steps,\nTogether they roam the immortal paths of Peng Isle.\n\n**Ode to Bamboo**\nI love your fine beauty,\nFacing the cloud hermitage,\nPersonally planting a cluster of jade-green stalks.\nEmerald shoots, moist and sleek,\nLeaf upon leaf, stalk upon stalk, tender green.\n\nGradually bearing offspring,\nStill surpassing the mother,\nRoots twisting like coiled dragons.\nIn the rustling wind of night,\nMoonlight shines through, sifting jade.\n\nFitting the recluse’s secluded heart,\nBeside the idle window, a companion,\nNaturally abundant in pure wind.\nNever withering, its substance unlike the crowd,\nHow could it resemble common flowers and trees?\n\nDefying snow, scorning frost,\nHollow-hearted, straight-jointed—\nAll wondrous principles are beyond the vulgar.\nNaturally solitary and simple,\nDaily increasing blessings beyond the world.\n\n**Gazing at the Moon on the Night of the Lantern Festival**\nOn the Lantern Festival’s fine night,\nJust as the full moon,\nSteps westward through the celestial channel.\nThe pale orb hangs in the sky, limpid and deep,\nAlone revealing its cold light, unattached.\n\nBright radiance fills heaven and earth,\nImpartial, illuminating all,\nFor ten thousand ages without flaw.\nLike a precious mirror,\nLuminous, suspended in the vast expanse.\n\nThe crimson towers and jade pavilions of Guye,\nA gathering of immortals,\nPhoenixes alight, clouds descending.\nAuspicious vapors and propitious mists envelop the jeweled halls,\nGold and azure glow intertwined.\n\nDrunk on peaches of immortality,\nRiding the rosy clouds away,\nSleeves trailing fragrant traces.\nFacing Song Mountain from afar,\nA promise within the silver platter.\n\n**On Wine**\nDu Kang discovered the wonder,\nBrewing the true essence of the Three Luminaries,\nClear, pure, and rich.\nThe immortal talent of Li Bai, drinking with abandon,\nOne cup, a hundred fine verses.\n\nThe old man of Mount Dao, carried home drunk,\nThe children of Xiangyang,\nLaughing and singing, clapping in unison.\nTao Qian beneath his hedge,\nDrunk and sleeping outside the Five Willows.\n\nIn Dongli, life and death both forgotten,\nWaiting for guests, cutting hair,\nTao’s mother entertains worthy friends.\nWenju, carefree, fills his cup,\nFragrant wine often opens laughing lips.\n\nRejoicing in the age of Yao,\nThe land of drunkenness, abundant and joyful—\nSuch things were rarely heard of in ancient times.\nThe spring hues of the jade pot\nProlong life’s blessings and years.\n\n**Eleven *Shengsheng Man***\n\nLong ago, my brother Tan,\nBound by family ties and nurturing care,\nAccumulated sins like a mountain.\nThen he met the immortal master in the east,\nTraveling to the Three Isles of the sea.\n\nExhorting the stubborn and foolish toward goodness,\nAwakening to the wheel of rebirth,\nAbandoning love to turn back.\nFollowing conditions, he passed through,\nGuarding purity and meekness,\nWandering as clouds and water.\n\nLater, passing the immortal palace of Huaizhou,\nStrolling through a noble county,\nHe encountered deep autumn.\nGradually entering the cold of severe winter,\nNowhere to take shelter.\nHe could only beg for paper and cloth,\nHoping the various lords would remember a fellow traveler.\nIf they awaken,\nLet them join cloud companions and rosy friends,\nTogether cultivating beyond the world.\n\n**Again**\nLong-Truth bows deeply,\nCovering all worthies—\nIn cultivation, only the heart must be firm.\nDay by day, trembling and cautious,\nEver fearing faults may arise.\n\nPlain and simple, poor and meek,\nNever at ease,\nRefraining from composing verses.\nTrue merit lies in\nCrushing the strong, subduing the sharp,\nIn silent stillness, forgetting words.\n\nIf there is nothing, go door to door begging,\nBefore others, do not display\nBrilliant elegance or madcap airs.\nConceal your radiance,\nSilently refining the elixir field.\nAfter a thousand days of effort,\nThis small matter is secretly transmitted.\nWhen merit is complete,\nRide auspicious clouds to return and attend the Origin.\n\n**Again**\nAt first, learning the Dao,\nEntering the gate of mystery,\nCarefree and wandering beyond the world.\nOccupying a hut day and night,\nInevitably seeking.\nDiligently coming and going,\nEntangled in worldly toil—\nHow could one awaken to true cultivation?\nThis path—\nWhen will merit be complete,\nTo ascend Peng Isle?\n\nSuddenly, vast and clear, a fierce awakening—\nExamining the original, single point,\nWhat idle sorrow is there?\n\nIn destitution, indulging in cloud-wandering,\nFreely seeking immortal companions.\nLike a fine hawk released from its cage,\nOr a monkey freed from its lock.\nI depart—\nShattering all illusions, then at rest.\n\n**Again**\nChasing fame and profit,\nEntangled in love and desire,\nDrifting in confusion, lost in haze.\nUnaware of fleeting vanity,\nSilently aging the youthful face.\nA hundred years pass like lightning,\nWhen the limit arrives—\nWho will face it with composure?\nRefusing to awaken,\nOnly then do they regret,\nEach one the same.\nSwiftly realize the perilous path ahead,\nTurn back step by step,\nAnd re-enter the immortal sect.\nDon the simple robe and blue headscarf,\nBefriend cloud companions and misty friends.\nCease seeking esoteric wonders outside—\nRecognize the spirit’s source,\nWhere the red elixir blooms like a lotus.\nSeek the true realm,\nRevel in the mountain’s bright moon and clear wind.\n\n**Again**\nVast and boundless, the sea of suffering,\nRiding waves, drifting with the current—\nBest to recognize the escape.\nWife and children, beloved kin,\nAre but karmic foes from past lives.\nIndulging in fleeting vanity,\nSquandering primordial yang\nWithout end.\nWhen the limit comes—\nWhat scheme will you devise,\nTo escape the dark and obscure?\nFailing to awaken to such peril,\nScheming day and night,\nCalculating, craving, pursuing.\nIn an instant, rebirth—\nSinking through a thousand lives,\nTen thousand kalpas adrift.\nSuddenly abandoning, entering the mysterious and wondrous,\nAvoiding the three paths,\nThe six realms of wandering.\nAct swiftly—\nWith wind and beings beyond the world,\nForm bonds with companions.\n\n**Again**\nVast and boundless, the sea of suffering,\nDrifting with the waves, lost—\nFoolish as moths drawn to a flame.\nEver deluded by wife and concubine,\nThe love of children.\nBound by such snares,\nWhen the limit arrives—\nAlone you descend to the Yellow Springs.\nIf you awaken,\nAbandon fleeting love and vanity,\nDwell in quiet cultivation.\nGradually sever worldly attachments,\nNurture the heart, cultivate qi,\nConceal your traces, bury your name.\nCoarse food, plain clothes,\nSilently refine the spirit’s clarity.\nThen the true person manifests,\nFrom nothingness—\nGold and jade take form.\nWhen the great elixir ripens,\nThis single spirit of true nature\nEndures forever.\n\n**To Master Mu**\nThe gate of cultivation—\nFirst, know the sequence:\nSever ties with sons, abandon wives.\nFiercely cast off worldly attachments,\nEmbrace solitude—\nThis is fitting.\nWith nothing, extend your hand in the streets,\nFor warmth, paper and cloth serve as garments.\nGo with the flow,\nUphold poverty, softness,\nQuench the fire, humble the heart.\nIn daily practice, bind the monkey, tether the horse,\nAbide in non-action, purity,\nSilently attune to the true master.\nWhen realms vanish and the heart is forgotten,\nSpirit congeals, qi forms the magic fungus.\nAttaining carefree freedom,\nCompose poems, exhort the deluded.\nWhen merit is complete,\nPoint the way to Peng Isle—\nRide a cloud home.\n\n**To Master Zhao**\nMaster Zhao entered the Dao,\nFiercely embracing the mysterious,\nSevering illusions in sudden awakening.\nFacing circumstances, cultivate without pause—\nThe fire nurtures the lotus.\nI now offer sincere words:\nWhen met with spears and blades,\nReceive teachings with magnanimity.\nIf afflicted,\nDwell in a hut as if dead—\nDo not return home.\nSteadfastly emulate such resolve,\nAs sages and worthies secretly reflect,\nA flawless mirror shines.\nWhen fire fades and smoke clears,\nThe spirit’s crucible yields the yellow sprout.\nSelfless nature stabilizes, life endures,\nThe heart pure—\nJade crystallizes the cinnabar.\nWhen merit is complete,\nAscend Penglai, guided by cranes,\nAmidst cloud-borne banners.\n\n**To Zhang Jiulang**\nHeaven and hell,\nGood and evil arise from the heart,\nLife and death—\nAwakening or delusion, who prevails?\nAwakening, abandoning family ties, forgetting the heart,\nExtend your hand in the streets.\nEmbrace simplicity, poverty, softness,\nWander as clouds and water,\nFree and untethered.\nHold fast to resolve,\nUphold the eternal,\nEnduring without end.\nWhen old karmic debts near their end,\nThe mysteries of sages and worthies\nAre secretly transmitted.\nThe heart pure, the mind clear—\nNaturally, the treasure forms in the elixir field.\nIf even a trace of transgression remains,\nCalamity returns—\nUnspeakable sins.\nWhen all is understood,\nAscend the three isles of Penglai,\nBecome an immortal.\n\n**To Brother Feng of Chang’an**\nExhort others to do good,\nCultivate yourself—\nBoth align with the Dao.\nAvoid the俗世乡土,\nKeep your distance.\nThe wondrous medicine cures deep illness,\nWithout regard for noble or base, high or low.\nNaturally, it follows reason—\nEmulate Master Longxi,\nUphold precepts and practice.\nCultivation demands fierce resolve,\nLike great rivers and mountains,\nSteadfast, unshaken.\nOutward conduct, complete and perfect—\nOne day, attain non-action.\nWandering as clouds and water,\nQi and spirit harmonized,\nMerit and conduct both fulfilled.\nWhen the great elixir ripens,\nPoint the way to Penglai—\nRide a cloud home.\n\n**To Brother Liu of Longevity**\nWith reverence, I bow,\nTo Master Liu—\nThree years have swiftly passed since we parted.\nOften, facing the wind and moon,\nI yearn for your noble presence.\nSuddenly, your teachings arrive—\nNow assured of your well-being.\nI rejoice,\nNo need for formalities—\nMy thoughts endure.\nI regret my worldly ties remain unsevered,\nIn Ci and Luo, drifting with circumstances.\nThe promised reunion unfulfilled,\nForgive this old fool’s shortcomings.\nEarly spring, I shall pay my respects,\nBy late autumn—\nMy plain wishes remain unspoken.\nI, Chuduan, await\nYour profound insights before the altar.\n\n**Six Lyrics to \"Man Ting Fang\"**\nDeceiving to build a household,\nStingy and greedy to amass wealth—\nIn quiet solitude, I ponder.\nRaising those few mouths,\nThe sins are mine alone.\nTime presses like an arrow,\nBlack hair turns to gray,\nYouth fades to age.\nIn a hundred years,\nWho can count them all?\nEndlessly striving, in vain.\n\n**If strong in body,**\nAwaken early,\nRecognize faults, repent swiftly,\nChange your ways.\nIn leisure, carefully\nIncrease blessings, dispel calamities.\nWith lofty resolve,\nCast off worldly bonds,\nWander beyond the mundane.\nCultivation is good—\nRoam mountains, play in waters,\nDaily burn incense in the heart.\n\n**Again**\nMist gathers, clouds disperse,\nThe autumn moon solitary, still—\nProfoundly, the subtle appears.\nEver at ease,\nSilently imbibing the elixir.\nThe precious tripod’s auspicious smoke gathers,\nQi and spirit unite—\nThe magic fungus forms.\nWander freely,\nDrifting as clouds and water,\nBeyond the world, seek kindred spirits.\n\n**Follow the Moment**\n\nFate passes like a fleeting thread—\nHungry, seek your meal;\nWandering, find your shelter.\nLet the sun and moon rush on,\nSeasons shift, stars realign.\nFor now, drift at ease in the dust,\nUntil merit is complete—\nThen another master awaits.\nWhen the time comes to return,\nA single bright moon\nWill walk alone to the Jasper Pool.\n\n**Again**\n\nAh, this foolish ox,\nStubborn, wild, and crude,\nTrampling fields, ravaging crops.\nTighten the nose-rope,\nRein in the blade at once.\nOld habits, ignorance’s chaos,\nOnly whip and strike\nWill turn its head at last.\nAt the point of forgetting,\nIt lies exhausted on the lonely peak,\nSilently, all ties dissolve.\n\n**Gradually Tamed**\n\nEach step now steady,\nThe goad lies idle,\nNo thought lingers in the heart.\nRoaming clouds and mountains freely,\nSinging songs of true delight.\nStraw cloak and hat rest by the ancient shore,\nA short flute plays\nNew melodies, drifting and long.\nAt dusk,\nMan and ox return home—\nOnly the autumn moon remains.\n\n**Again**\n\nSeek not east or west,\nNor search south or north—\nThe Mysterious True lies within.\nCut all ties at once,\nThen spirit and qi harmonize.\nOnly when your heart is bold,\nRaise the sword of wisdom,\nSplit the darkness of delusion.\nDo you yet know?\nLet go of all,\nAnd life and nature will round into perfection.\n\n**True Emptiness**\n\nBeyond form and appearance,\nIn leisure, in stillness,\nSlowly, slowly cease all striving.\nContent with coarse cloth,\nDrifting beyond the world’s dust.\nHungry? Go door to door for rice.\nFull? Then bright moon and clear wind.\nIn freedom,\nNo more chatter, no more wandering—\nCarefree, east or west.\n\n---\n\n**To Marshal Wang of Junzhou**\n\nMoths drawn to lamplight,\nBees craving flower’s nectar—\nAsk yourself: what end awaits?\nTo cultivate the Way,\nFirst escape the storm’s black waves.\nWith wisdom’s sword, sever all ties,\nLeave home, abandon kin.\nA wanderer of mist and clouds,\nSteps steady on water’s path,\nFollow your nature, nurture heaven’s harmony.\n\n**Wear Away**\n\nShed old sins,\nContent with coarse cloth,\nTrust the slow grind of time.\nCompose poems, sing verses,\nLet words flow from tongue and lips.\nFrom ancient times to now, the enlightened\nAre no more, no less—\nJust themselves.\nOf immortals’ tales,\nSpeak not of Penglai’s isles—\nIt is like climbing a high slope.\n\n---\n\n**To Zhao the Palace Graduate of Fuchang County**\n\nConfucian learning is noble,\nLiterary fame brings honor—\nYet life’s path is but vanity and excess.\nToiling heart and will,\nYearning to ascend clouds and mist.\nEven if you pass the exams, pluck the osmanthus,\nThe dream of golden grain\nWill wake to sighs.\nWhen impermanence comes,\nEven the great like Xiangru and Du Fu—\nWhat escape is there?\n\n**Fleeting Glory**\n\nSee through it,\nBreak free from worldly ties,\nLive beyond the dust.\nSeek the idle drift of clouds and water,\nNurture the root’s sprout.\nWhen heart is clear and mind is pure,\nThe Three Lights shine,\nCongealing cinnabar.\nWhen merit is complete,\nThe Three Pure Ones will lift you,\nRising to the Great Luo’s realm.\n\n---\n\n**Four Water Dragon Chants**\n\nTo cultivate the supreme bodhi,\nBegin at once, without delay.\nLet no water cling,\nNo mud drag,\nNo trifling bonds entangle.\nLife and death—\nSee them as nothing,\nDecide for yourself.\nShed the mortal frame’s filth,\nOn the misty path,\nLightly, gradually,\nTransform all.\n\nStep by step, the cool other shore.\nIn idle ease,\nForget schemes, cease calculations.\nFire extinguished, smoke dispersed,\nIce congealed, jade formed—\nEternal companions.\nAttain true emptiness,\nThe wondrous mystery unfolds,\nBeyond self and other.\nWhen the elixir completes nine cycles,\nAt the Double Ninth,\nWe’ll meet again in Penglai’s halls.\n\n**Again**\n\nFrom the first, a single point arrived,\nFortunate in its pure and gentle form.\nYet love grew, delusion spread,\nObscuring the endless true treasure.\nEach person lost,\nAll to this end—\nChasing passions, aging in vain.\nThe immortal embryo so easily\nSinks in the bitter sea,\nTossed by waves,\nWasted away.\n\nAwaken swiftly to the wheel’s return,\nReverse the dust-bound heart.\nFire extinguished, smoke dispersed,\nIce congealed, jade formed—\nThe herb of immortality grows.\nSilently, firmly,\nGuard your own furnace and cauldron.\nWithin three thousand merits,\nDiligently refine—\nThe end is certain.\n\n**Again**\n\nThe world tells of three islands in the sea,\nHiding herbs of feathered transcendence.\nQin Shi Huang believed it,\nSent Xu Fu eastward\nTo Penglai’s shores.\nClouds, water, wind, and waves vast—\nMen and women in the boats grew old.\nGazing toward the immortal’s source,\nMisty waves stretch endlessly,\nHeart torn—\nWhen will they arrive?\n\nPity those lost in delusion,\nFutilely stirring up\nEmpty vexations.\nThey do not see\nThe dust of illusion obscures\nThe true treasure of prior heaven.\nSuddenly awaken to worldly ties,\nGuard purity, embrace non-action—\nThe work is done.\nWhen heart is clear and mind is still,\nNature rounds, elixir forms—\nThen feast on the immortal herb.\n\n**Again**\n\nAuspicious clouds cradle three peaks,\nWhere perfected beings descend and transform.\nAuspicious mists veil deep\nJade towers, jeweled halls,\nJasper palaces, secluded and profound.\nWithin ten thousand acres of misty light,\nAs if descending\nJade springs and lotus waters.\nBehold the immortal’s palm—\nThe crescent moon,\nEver bright,\nFlawless.\n\nGreen cliffs rise, layer upon layer,\nPeaks teem with gibbons’ cries, cranes’ calls.\nI come and sigh—\nBound by dust’s reins,\nEntangled in love, fame, profit.\nRolling on like flowing waves,\nHow many can climb?\nNow, in the stillness of the Milky Way,\nUnmoving,\nBecome the marrow of yin and yang.\n\n---\n\n**Twenty-One Lyrics to \"Ru Meng Ling\"**\n\nMirror and medicine gathered, guard simplicity,\nNo kindred spirit to speak to.\nThe ancient mirror must be polished—\nWhere touched, it shines through.\nJoy,\nJoy—\nA full moon emerges.\n\n**Again**\n\nBamboo hat, bamboo crown, bamboo bowl,\nMy daily companions.\nSitting, lying, coming, going—empty,\nThis is the cool other shore.\nWind’s realm,\nWind’s realm—\nThe sun and moon’s wheel turns on, heedless.\n\nOnly sweep the spirit-terrace again and again,\nCherish your own true treasure.\nWithin fire, the lotus blooms eternal—\nSuch is the mystery of cultivation’s arcana.\nUpside-down,\nUpside-down—\nWhen realms vanish and mind is forgotten, all is clarity.\n\n**Again**\n\nA wisp of numinous emptiness for company,\nSever the bonds of desire and passion.\nAs the sun ascends, refine the void,\nAbide forever in the ancient shrine of the spirit-hall.\nWind’s realm,\nWind’s realm—\nBeyond this, no other means exists.\n\n**Again**\n\nAttend to the skin-sack as your portion allows,\nWhether sitting, lying, coming, or going—lucid and free.\nRoam joyfully through the world’s scenes,\nUnburdened by even a wisp of birth’s entanglements.\nEndure,\nEndure—\nClaim the carefree and unbound.\n\n**Again**\n\nRoaming beyond the mundane, carefree and untrammeled,\nEach step treads on cool clouds’ trailing skirts.\nIn leisure, play with the void,\nAnother tryst awaits in Penglai’s isles.\nObserve,\nObserve—\nStrip away the fine threads of human sentiment.\n\n**Again**\n\nThe Great Dao is nameless, beyond speech,\nCast aside vain distinctions and delusions.\nWhen fire fades and smoke disperses,\nThat is the fairest season, the finest hour.\nEmbrace simplicity,\nEmbrace simplicity—\nRecognize the spring blossoms, the autumn moon.\n\n**Again**\n\nThe Great Dao’s root returns to the plain,\nCutting away all human cares and cogitations.\nWhen fire fades and smoke disperses,\nRecognize the primordial yang gathered and secured.\nThus act,\nThus act—\nThis is the swiftest path to long life.\n\n**Again**\n\nThrough encountering Master Chongyang,\nI was led into the gate of the Complete Perfection.\nWisdom’s fire tempers the numinous void,\nDaring not take a single step astray.\nOne step,\nOne step—\nEach step draws nearer than the last.\n\n**Again**\n\nIn purity and non-action, penetrate to the utmost,\nLet no high or low distinctions arise.\nExtinguish the hearts of self and others,\nAnd the true master will lift you.\nLift you,\nLift you—\nClouds part to reveal the moon in every home.\n\n**Again**\n\nIn daily practice, wash away dust and grime,\nSeize and bind the monkey and horse to keep them from straying.\nWith hands outstretched before the street,\nGuard the One without yielding to greed or scheming.\nGreed and scheming,\nGreed and scheming—\nHow then shall merit be perfected and the Way achieved?\n\n**Again**\n\nUnstained by worldly passions, not out of pride,\nNor scorning the poor to chase the rich.\nDare not accept others’ reverence,\nBut roam free as clouds and waters.\nClouds and waters,\nClouds and waters—\nGuard the One, in non-action to the core.\n\n**Again**\n\nDo not marvel that brothers do not pant,\nOnly that worldly ties grow distant.\nDare not accept others’ reverence,\nNor delight in fine robes or lavish feasts.\nUnfurl,\nUnfurl—\nTemper the cinnabar through nine transformations.\n\n**Again**\n\nA carefree old man, unbound and wandering,\nRoaming free and at ease.\nOne day he returns to his mountain

sealed within,\nPreserving the true heart from ruin.\nGold and jade congeal and settle,\nSo that birth and death cannot approach me.\nMerit’s fruit,\nMerit’s fruit—\nReturning alone, bearing clouds in hand.\n\n**To Daoist Friend Wang Silang of Junzhou**\n\nA message for the Daoist friends of Junzhou:\nDo not cling to the fleeting blossoms of passion.\nBest to follow Master Tan’s wind,\nPreserving the body from decay.\nUndecaying,\nUndecaying—\nTogether we drink the immortal wine of long life.\n\n**To the Third Aunt of the Wang San Commissioner’s Residence**\n\nTo cultivate amidst the worldly,\nFirst extinguish the distinctions of self and others.\nIn softness and humility, guard poverty,\nUnwavering in resolve from beginning to end.\nTrue goodness,\nTrue goodness—\nDiminish the self to benefit others with ease.\n\n**To Jia Xin of Xiuwu, a Practitioner of the Dao**\n\nMaster Jia, a practitioner of the Dao,\nIn daily life holds his heart low.\nTo see the original true,\nIn stillness seize the monkey and catch the horse.\nSeize and play,\nSeize and play—\nMust follow Master Tan’s path to mute the throat.\n\n**To Daoist Friends Zhang and Li**\n\nAlas, this floating life is brief,\nYet all are lost in qi, wealth, lust, and wine.\nIf awakened to forsake worldly ties,\nTogether we may bind cloud companions and rosy friends.\nDear friends,\nDear friends—\nPreserve the body from decay.\n\n**To the Wine Merchant of Wenxiang County**\n\nDeeply fond of Master Jia’s auspicious goodness,\nWandering through water and clouds with mysterious ease.\nOne day, abiding in non-action,\nHe will witness the tiger and dragon in battle.\nIn battle,\nIn battle—\nThe elixir congeals, forever dispelling the thousand changes.\n\n**Expressing My Feelings**\n\nA single spark of spirit-light never dims,\nMoving in and out, coming and going without hindrance.\nEverywhere it manifests as perfect clarity,\nIn every thing and every head, all responds with understanding.\nBe patient,\nBe patient—\nNo misfortune can ever invade.\n\n**Eight Poems to the Tune of \"Moon over the West River\"**\n\nMy servitude arises from heart and will,\nWash away the mysteries of prajna.\nNo need to labor east or west, north or south—\nA tiny inch of the square heart is all.\nThe precious mirror, veiled in dust,\nMust be polished to gleam.\nA single point of light illumines non-action,\nStraight into Penglai’s hidden depths.\n\nAgain,\nSeek not the Dao outside,\nThe spiritual sprout springs from the heart’s field.\nPlow deep with the iron ox to see the root,\nAll lies in diligent refinement.\nRecognize the original face of the moon,\nHold the body upright, let no deviation sway.\nDraw the six-grave bow taut and round,\nEach arrow strikes the red heart with proof.\n\nAgain,\nSudden awakening breaks the cycle to enter the Dao,\nThrough ceaseless refinement in the midst of time.\nPreserve and diminish with utmost devotion,\nTo escape future transmigration.\nFire extinguished, the five-petaled lotus blooms,\nSmoke dispersed, jade congeals in the three fields.\nDesiring to transcend the supreme, leave behind gods and men,\nFathom the ancient hall of emptiness.\n\nAgain,\nTo enter the gate of Perfect Truth,\nIn movement, stillness, sitting, lying—all is desolate quiet.\nWith heart set on alms, pass through the world’s court,\nLaying aside every worldly affair.\nSpeak not of yellow sprouts or white snow,\nSeek not dragon, tiger, infant, or maiden.\nFree from attachment to form and wealth, the fire and smoke vanish—\nThen you are on Penglai’s three isles.\n\nAgain,\nAlas, how swiftly time flies,\nEach day brings thoughts and worries.\nFoolishly content to drift like passing waves,\nBewitched by qi, wealth, lust, and wine.\nSun and moon silently hasten man’s aging,\nFame and profit never let the heart rest.\nHow much better to lay all down and gaze at the mountain’s peak—\nThe bright moon belongs to every household.\n\nAgain,\nAfter cold, add a layer of paper or cloth,\nWhen hungry, stretch out your hand to beg in the streets.\nCold porridge and stale rice suffice for a meal,\nGentle poverty keeps harm at bay.\nAll misfortune arises from the heart,\nWith no heart, there is no misfortune, no disaster.\nOnce the heart is settled, guard the true embryo,\nWandering clouds and water, carefree and at ease.\n\nAgain,\nAfter cold, add a layer of paper or cloth,\nWhen hungry, beg for scraps.\nWild at heart, gladly accepting the coarse and simple,\nJust enough to cover the body and fill the belly.\nI sigh at my own foolishness,\nVainly setting up remedies to guard against restraint.\nFrom now on, lay all down and delight in pure emptiness,\nBecome a simple, carefree old man.\n\nAgain,\nTo practice with companions is not yet the way,\nWander beyond the world, holding fast.\nLike a solitary cloud or wild crane, drift east or west,\nWithout the slightest hindrance.\nSeek two simple meals a day,\nPure and clean, in non-action.\nDesolate quiet and free ease are most fitting—\nThere is another kind of savor.\n\n**Two Poems to the Tune of \"Incense Procession\"**\n\nAttaining without cultivation,\nNo delusion, no seeking.\nLet the heart be at leisure—\nNo joy, no sorrow.\nCarefree and at ease,\nWandering clouds and water.\nDelving into the mysterious within emptiness,\nThe wondrous within the mysterious,\nThe secluded within the wondrous.\n\nFallen and dissolute,\nFace grimy, hair disheveled.\nBlissfully drunk,\nSinging songs of true joy.\nContent with whatever comes, truly refined.\nThis way comes non-being,\nNon-being comes being,\nBeing comes from reason.\n\nAgain,\nMorning, guard the heart,\nEvening, guard the heart.\nFear the heart’s arising,\nLest familiar scenes invade.\nMany skills and arts—\nCalligraphy, painting, chess, zither—\nNo longer give rise to greed,\nNo longer cling to love,\nStep onto the jade peak.\nGood arises from the heart,\nEvil arises from the heart.\nWith the heart at ease, evil intentions wildly seek.\nThe heart born, time passes in vain,\nDays and months like flowing clouds,\nLike departing water,\nSeek a knowing friend.\n\n**Three Poems to the Tune of \"Clouds and Mist Gather\"**\n\nHide your brilliance,\nFeign foolishness.\nDully, drowsily,\nStroll idly in leisure.\nFace grimy, hair disheveled, clothes in tatters.\nBegging without shame,\nOnly then are you a companion of mist and clouds.\n\nAbandon pride,\nPursue truth and simplicity.\nSeek no admiration,\nNor choose lowly or humble places.\nRecognize the true words of Master Danyang.\nClear and awake,\nWhen merit is complete, return to Penglai’s path.\n\nAgain,\nEngage in practice,\nDo not slight it.\nRecognize the rain in the clouds,\nFine and clear.\nThe pure, cool spiritual sprout emerges.\nSeeking outside the heart,\nVainly exhausts effort in futility.\nSitting and walking,\nLying and abiding,\nLeisurely search in leisure,\nLeisurely act in freedom.\nThe golden flower blooms, opening the jade door.\nA single path of light\nShines straight onto the road of non-action.\n\nAgain,\n\nTo the wayfarer, lend an ear and hear my brief plea.\nDonning the false to seek the true—best turn your gaze back.\nExamine your conduct and intent; cast off longing for the old.\nIf not aligned with emptiness,\nHow dwell in Penglai’s isles?\n\nRecognize the primal origin, return to purity and simplicity.\nDiligently polish the spirit’s terrace,\nLet no dust or grime defile it.\nBanish greed, wrath, and delusion from the heart.\nIn hidden depths, merit ripens—\nA true master emerges to guide you.\n\n*Linjiang Xian* (Three Poems)\n\nAh, the wondrous truth of the Perfect Real:\nNo striving, no doing, no cultivation.\nNaturally pure, the work of practice complete.\nAuspicious clouds encircle crimson gates,\nAuspicious qi swirls around jade towers.\n\nThe heart like idle clouds, unobstructed,\nThe body like a ferryboat moored at an ancient ford.\nThe true void’s boundless realm may be met.\nA white ox sleeps on dew-kissed earth,\nA bright moon illumines the mountain’s peak.\n\nAgain,\nIllusory blossoms of fleeting life—cease clinging in vain.\nThe Southern Asterism and Northern Dipper shift endlessly.\nIn darkness, raven locks turn to silver threads.\nA hundred years pass like a dream,\nSeventy years have ever been rare.\n\nI urge all to awaken and reflect:\nWho knows when the wheel of rebirth’s limit will come?\nCultivation is timely now, not later.\nThe sins of past wrongs—\nTo escape them, hasten your practice.\n\nAgain,\nI bow to all Daoist companions of my gate:\nSubdue the heart, cease seeking outward.\nTime slips by so easily, so carelessly wasted.\nWhat is true cultivation?\nNothing but the settling of this human heart.\n\nExtinguish the three fires of ignorance’s karmic roots,\nLet no external realm encroach.\nOriginally, not a speck rises or sinks.\nAttain true leisure, and with each step,\nAscend the lofty peaks.\n\n*Lianli Zhi*\n\nFoolish folk of this fleeting world,\nEver chasing fame and profit.\nLove’s ocean, kindness’ mountain—\nEntanglements that bind and delude:\nWine, lust, wealth, and pride.\n\nCount glory and riches as lightning’s flash—\nBetter turn the heart and repent.\nSeek liberation early,\nSilently probe the mysteries.\nIn quietude and poverty, in leisure,\nPass the days as the Daoist’s livelihood.\nUphold the non-active, pure practice,\nComplete the work’s cycle—\nThen attend the Jade Pool’s banquet.\n\nTo the Honorable An, Jieyuan of Jingzhao Prefecture, and Lord Taiyuan in his illness:\nHear my earnest words.\n\nThe sages and worthies await to lift you up—\nBest to rest now.\nCount a human life: seventy years,\nAs the ancients said, rare indeed.\nWhen you reach that point,\nMake the resolute choice to lay all down.\nSever the ties that drag,\nTurn toward leisure’s ease,\nReturn to purity’s simplicity,\nAbide in tranquil nurturance of the unskilled.\nRecognize the numinous source,\nTemper and polish it to clarity.\nAll past karmic obstructions,\nWithin the merit of three thousand deeds,\nWill gradually dissolve and vanish.\nGreen mountains, blue waters—\nFive companions share the wind and moon’s delight.\n\n*Caisangzi*\n\nTo Dharma Master Wang of Huojia:\nTalks of wind—how he favors his father, Wang the Third,\nA bond from past lives.\nNo more delay.\nWife’s scorn, children’s disdain—leave the worldly abode.\nIn cultivation, outwardly practice non-action,\nImprison the horse, capture the monkey.\nDo not return to the home garden,\nAnd you shall surely become a carefree immortal beyond the material world.\n\n*Moshanxi, Two Poems*\n\nIn cultivation and refinement,\nSeek not the infant and the maiden.\nRecognize the original root at the beginning,\nRise from the dust—\nMust remove, must not cling.\nAlways abide in right awakening,\nMeet each encounter with discernment.\nCut off human sentiments,\nDepart from clamor and noise,\nAbandon all worldly affairs one by one.\nWalk the long path with ease,\nIn leisure, harmonize the provisional.\nWithin emptiness, engage in true cultivation,\nSo clear, so cool, so free.\nAt midday, still and diminished,\nTruly merge with the void and nothingness.\nDelight in carefree wandering,\nTurn toward leisure’s ease,\nStep by step, enter the realm of no-birth.\n\nAgain:\nAmid the dust, toiling and bustling,\nChasing hollow fame and profit.\nNo more such bitter labor of the heart,\nEver petty, ever harming spirit and qi.\nTurn your head—it is old age.\nAwaken, and withdraw at once.\nCast off glory, sever wealth and lust,\nFind joy in the Dao, transcend the floating world.\nKindness and love’s entanglements,\nLike fish playing in a cauldron.\nNo more debate on early cultivation—\nWhy postpone one day after another?\nThe poet’s gentle admonition,\nSoft words shatter delusion and folly.\nAct early, swiftly proceed,\nMake plans for the journey ahead.\n\n*Qingyuan Case: Urging the Horse*\n\nThe true master guides onto the path of cultivation,\nSilent, wordless phrases.\nSlowly, steadily refine and return to true simplicity.\nEach reflection turned inward dissolves into emptiness—\nThe horse awakens.\nWithin and without, verified,\nNo dusty concerns remain.\nTruly pure, truly clear, enter the true place,\nCarefully search for the wondrous, mysterious joy.\nSee through fleeting splendor, embrace the clear and void.\nThe demon-subduing sword severs karmic ties—\nThe horse is liberated.\nStep by step, enter the gate of eternal life.\n\n*Ruanlangui, Two Poems*\n\n**On Tea**\n\nAt yin-yang’s first union, a thunderclap—\nThe sacred sprout unfurls in delicate grace.\nThe jade-like artisan crafts with subtle art,\nBoiling, snow-white waves take flight.\n\nEyes of Dao-seeing,\nAwakening from stupor,\nBitter within, sweetness most rare.\nDo you yet know that trace of true flavor?\nAlone, you return through mist and cloud.\n\n---\n\n**Again**\n\nLeisurely, cloud and water drift east and west,\nA wisp of spirit follows, free and light.\nDrowsy, silent, it soars to and fro—\nThe journey ahead is already known.\n\nThe true Great Dao,\nBeyond the dust’s mechanism,\nDetached from all things, one by one.\nChongyang grants me the white ox—\nNow, who is this?\n\n---\n\n**Three *Busuanzi***\n\nThe Four Great Causes compose,\nCrossing the bitter sea by boat.\nA gust of pure wind reaches the shore—\nAscend the path of no rebirth.\n\nPeople sigh at poverty’s hardship,\nI tread the path of carefree ease.\nEmbodiment shed, utterly empty, not a coin—\nYet richer than Shi Chong’s wealth.\n\n---\n\n**Again**\n\nSince entering the gate of mystery,\nI dwell in stillness, clarity, and void.\nIn quietude, I search the Four False Forms,\nSeeing through the dusty road of existence.\n\nAwakening upon awakening,\nAttaining true leisure’s delight.\nI gather the priceless truth within—\nHow could I chase after worldly favor?\n\n---\n\n**Again**\n\nA madman at ease,\nCrossing to the other shore by divine boat.\nTen thousand miles of cloudless sky,\nMoonlight illumines the Cao Creek path.\n\nSevering the bitterness of karmic ties,\nSilently, I fathom the mystery’s joy.\nLet others laugh at my poverty—\nWithin, I am boundlessly rich.\n\n---\n\n**Five *Qinyuan Chun* by Changzhenzi Tan Chuduan of Kunlun Mountain**\n\nDesire knows no bounds,\nThis limited form—\nWhy exhaust yourself in vain?\nThese karmic ties bring\nSons and daughters,\nTheir own food and clothing,\nEach following their fate.\nVain scheming, empty calculations—\nWhen the great limit arrives, who will stand for you?\nYou must awaken,\nWithdraw early beyond the world’s dust,\nAnd gain advantage.\n\nProcrastination—even now, the hand moves too slow.\nNever wander afar in search of subtleties.\nWhere the dust-heart stirs,\nAll is demonic delusion.\nYet the original, primordial essence remains—\nRefine and dispel the stupor.\n\nTrue stillness, true compassion,\nMysterious waves wash clean,\nAbiding in carefree, boundless realms.\nA thousand ages hence,\nA single point within the spirit-terrace\nShines with the light of non-action.\n\n---\n\n**Again**\n\nIllusion, vanity,\nA hundred years of light—\nA sigh, a single instant.\nFutile, this bustling toil,\nStriving for fame and profit,\nWealth and honor—\nHow much can you grasp?\nMirage towers, rainbow bridges,\nA fleeting moment—can it last?\nHearken while strong,\nEscape the seething bitter sea,\nSwiftly climb the high slope.\n\nWisdom, do not delay.\nAll worldly affairs are empty—\nLet the body pass unscathed.\nRecognize the original, primordial treasure,\nTarnished by dust, slowly polish it clean.\nNurture the sacred root,\nWater it ceaselessly—\nAmid the waters, golden blossoms bear jade branches.\nBeyond birth and death,\nThis original point,\nNeither more nor less.\n\n---\n\n**Again**\n\nHow pointless—\nThis endless chase of fame and profit,\nWhen will it end?\nWealth, honor, high rank,\nFair wives, lovely daughters—\nWho would persist in cultivation?\nThe cold, austere gate of mystery,\nThe clear, wondrous Dao—\nBitter and harsh, who would remain?\nOn the path of practice,\nAwaken to the cycle of birth and death—\nOnly then may one join the immortal stream.\n\nCast off all idle sorrows,\nSever karmic ties at once.\nDon the blue kerchief, plain robes,\nLive by fate’s decree,\nWander carefree beyond the world.\nIn leisure, seek leisure,\nReduce and reduce again,\nFire extinguished, smoke vanished—no outward seeking.\nWhen you depart,\nThe road to Fengdu transforms\nInto Penglai’s isles.\n\n---\n\n**Again**\n\nFrom ancient times, wise and foolish alike,\nThe turning sun and moon\nAll sink into the yellow springs.\nAlas, Zhang and Chen, their bonds of loyalty severed\nFor fame and profit,\nThe extravagant Later Lord,\nWho ruined his homeland.\nBy the Jiang of Chu’s temple,\nNear the Han’s imperial tombs,\nPower exhausted, all returns to emptiness.\nHeroes of the age,\nAll leave behind crumbling mounds,\nWeeds stretching endlessly.\n\nAlas! The past is pitiable,\nClinging to illusion, chasing fleeting vanities.\nWhy not awaken,\nAbandon the toil of dust and dreams,\nEmbrace poverty’s leisure, return to simplicity,\nRefine the cinnabar field?\nCross beyond the cycle of rebirth,\nRise above the bitter sea,\nBoard the cool, prajna boat.\nOn the carefree shore,\nMeet the jade path of mystery’s friends,\nTogether seek the Peach Blossom Spring.\n\n---\n\n**Again**\n\nSwiftly, time passes,\nThe Four Greats float in emptiness,\nRight and wrong long entrenched.\nWho can preserve this cycle?\nFrom dawn to dusk, ensnared,\nFamily ties, love’s bonds,\nDelaying, entangling.\nA single true spirit,\nThrough a thousand lives, ten thousand kalpas,\nDrifts in the bitter sea, bound to karmic chains.\nYou must awaken,\nIn your own household, be bold,\nContend for life and death.\n\nWisdom, heed these subtle words,\nLay down idle sorrows,\nSearch the wondrous mystery.\nRecognize poverty’s leisure, stillness,\nCease harsh judgments,\nBring forth the original, primordial point,\nFresh and new.\nUpright, selfless,\nEver practicing equality,\nUnfettered, carefree, follow nature.\nTrue merit and practice,\nIn leisure, slowly,\nAccumulate into thousands.\n\n---\n\n**Two *Wang Hai Chao***\n\nThe Great Dao of Quanzhen,\nNon-action, purity—\nYet layer upon layer, obstacles to sigh over.\nOften lamenting my own karma,\nDrawn irresistibly,\nWandering cloud and water, drifting aimlessly.\nFree from thoughts, beyond slander and heresy,\nI wish all would awaken early,\nHasten past the fleeting splendor.\nThe Dao’s Ancestor ascended west—\nEven then, he avoided the flowing sands.\n\nReturn to the earth’s lungs, the immortal’s home.\nMeet cloud companions, radiant friends,\nBoundless true joy.\nIn the empty hall, feasting,\nPeaches of immortality in riotous bloom,\nJade cups brimming with flowing霞.\nAll seated, adorned with jasper blossoms.\nAttaining the profound, profound union,\nA single grain of cinnabar.\nAt this moment, merit complete, practice fulfilled,\nTogether we sail the cloud raft.\n\n---\n\n**Again**\n\nAlas, this floating world—\nWho can awaken?\nEach person, shrouded in mundane illusions.\nFaces wither day by day,\nYet still they toil in suffering,\nGreedily clinging to love’s infants.\nThe sea of desire’s waves stretch far.\nDriven by the two wheels,\nHair soon frosts with silver.\nSuddenly, impermanence arrives—\nWhat logic can escape its grasp?\n\nHow much better to awaken swiftly and cast off the household,\nSevering all dust-bound ties, within firming the root-sprout.\nThree thousand secret essentials, eight hundred hidden merits,\nRefining conduct with unwavering sincerity.\nTreading cloud and water through mist and radiance,\nRecognizing the true splendor of the Three Lights,\nCongealing cinnabar’s elixir.\nOne day, merit complete, you shall depart—\nSailing the Numinous Raft between Ox and Dipper.\n\nFreely roaming,\nI cherish poverty’s leisure, idly coming and going.\nSimple, untroubled, free of calamity,\nCold gruel and stale rice, no smoke nor fire,\nEating a plateful—just enough to warm the belly.\nOthers’ rights and wrongs matter not to me,\nFor I have seen through worldly affairs.\nDrifting, carefree, following conditions as they come,\nFreely roaming in dwelling, walking, sitting, lying.\n\n*Two Southern Branch Songs*\n\nFrequently trimming the candle of luminous clarity,\nDiligently honing the blade of wisdom.\nTen thousand entanglements cut away, not a thread remains,\nTempering from the primal origin—spare no effort to the end.\nRadiance soars above water’s depths,\nSnowy waves cast from mountain peaks.\nTiger and dragon coil round the crucible,\nForging the immortal elixir,\nStep by step ascending the azure heavens.\n\nAgain—\nClouds drift, the southern mountains grow still,\nWind comes, the Wei River turns cold.\nWalking the waves, congealing into a single mass,\nGazing across ten thousand miles of clear sky,\nSo crisp and bright in this moment.\nThe hero’s sword rings as it leaves the scabbard,\nA head rolls onto the jade platter.\nA bright moon climbs the balustrade—\nOnly then, from this point on,\nDoes the heart-mind find true ease.\n\n*Oriole’s Song*\n\n**Living Ghosts**\n\nLiving ghosts, living ghosts—\nday after day in the marketplace,\ncontending for fame, scrambling for gain,\nclinging to fair maidens, darling sons,\ncasting aside the root and source.\nToo late to seek deliverance,\nwhat recourse when the final hour comes?\nYou’ll have no share in heaven’s ascent,\nbut fate will drag you down to earth.\n\n*Bodhisattva Barbarian*\n\nWhere the blade of wisdom swings, heads roll,\nrainbow light surges through the clouds’ feet.\nMy human heart extinguished—\nwhy seek beyond?\n\nWhite lotus blooms within fire,\ndharma-endurance transcends life and death.\nPatience and shame both void,\ntortoise-hair and hare-horn the same.\n\n---\n\n**Auspicious Partridge (Eleven Songs)**\n\nIn cultivation, seek not the tiger-dragon child,\nonly the luminous clarity that knows the primal mechanism.\nDulled, Amitābha becomes an outer thief;\nawakened, affliction is bodhi.\n\nConstantly examine your own faults—mind grows bright;\nonly seeing others’ wrongs—nature turns deluded.\nShatter every bond, then rest—\nin the empty hall, companion to the Muni.\n\n---\n\nAgain—\nIn cultivation, seek not the tiger-dragon child,\nfire extinguished, smoke dispersed, wealth and desire left behind.\nWithin, refine qi and spirit to ninefold transmutation;\nwithout, purge impurities, expel the Three Corpses.\n\nDwell in stillness, speak not of others’ faults;\nabide in purity, search only your own transgressions.\nKeep the spiritual root unobstructed—\nnaturally, you’ll realize the fruit of buddhahood.\n\n---\n\nAgain—\nIn cultivation, frequently trim the lamp within your nature,\nilluminating the long-darkened gloom.\nLet go of every attachment, every thing—\ndull and silent, words cease.\n\nTranscending the mundane to enter sageliness is not by my doing;\nhell and heaven lie entirely within you.\nOnly one true path remains—\ndwell always, firmly sealing the four city gates.\n\n---\n\nAgain—\nEach pursues the Dao, yet craves rank flesh,\ndrunk on wine, infatuated with flowers, bound by sin.\nThe heart’s craving for flesh harms living beings;\nthe mind’s greed for love erodes the root.\n\nBoasting of medicinal arts, claiming mastery,\nwho believes in the golden precepts’ secret mystery?\nWhen you awaken to emptiness, rest—\nlay it all down and cultivate immortality.\n\n---\n\nAgain—\nCultivate the heart like cold ashes,\nrelease delusion, greed, anger, desire, wealth.\nHow can self and other yield the fruit of the Dao?\nHow can right and wrong give birth to the true embryo?\n\nWhen ignorance is extinguished, ascend the golden palace;\nwhen passions and desires are forgotten, bow at the jade steps.\nRefinement must end in smoke and fire’s demise—\nfor where the heart is low, Penglai appears.\n\n---\n\nAgain—\nThe original true nature is the mystery’s mechanism,\ngrasped only in luminous clarity’s awakening.\nFire extinguished, smoke dispersed—the great medicine forms;\nrealms forgotten, mind exhausted—bodhi appears.\n\nLeisurely stillness is the true immortal’s path,\nsolitude and non-action the ladder from the world.\nNot a single dharma arises, no obstructions—\ncultivation is only this.\n\n---\n\nAgain—\nIn cultivation, sing the falling-flower lotus,\ndiminish and diminish, idle and idle, follow nature.\nWhen the sun rises, speak not of others’ faults;\nthroughout the day, frequently correct your own bias.\n\nDo not stray from the square inch to seek the elixir;\ndo not wander outside to find the wondrous mystery.\nKeep the spirit-terrace empty of all things—\nthen the ninefold transmutation births the embryonic immortal.\n\n---\n\nAgain—\nCultivation is neither easy nor hard,\nresponding to things with compassion, recognizing inner stillness.\nWhere the mind harbors dust, mountains become markets;\nwhere the heart holds no affairs, markets become mountains.\n\nConstantly till three plots of pure fields,\nsteadfastly guard one chamber of non-action.\nEarth endures, heaven lasts—devote yourself to one aim,\nand naturally the purple-golden elixir coalesces.\n\n---\n\nAgain—\nDo not say cultivation is easy to uphold,\ndiminishing and preserving, fearing hindrance and conflict.\n\nAgain—\nTwo meals—beware lest they encroach upon Dao-friends;\na single coin—fear it may harm the realm of mystery.\nAmong crowds, guard your speech and forget pride;\nin solitude, rein in the mind and halt its gallop.\nThrough the twelve hours, constantly turn the light inward,\nstill doubting whether hidden scrutiny reveals selflessness.\n\nTo Master Wang of Yun’an:\nMaster Wang, secluded in deep retreat, dines on fine fare,\nprotecting the numinous root and guarding inner stillness.\nWhere emotion lingers, mountains become markets;\nwhere desire is absent, markets become mountains.\nNurture the spirit with constant warmth,\nand when qi-refinement is complete, repel heat and cold.\nUnwavering from start to finish,\nnaturally the precious *langgan* coalesces.\n\nTo Master Guo:\nStill the heart, reduce affairs to nourish the root-source,\nabiding in tranquil emptiness and guarding the natural.\nAccumulate virtue and benevolent influence, following Confucius and Mencius;\nseek seclusion and lofty purity, emulating Yan and Yuan.\nIn samādhi, gaze upon the bright moon of a mid-autumn night;\nin wondrous subtlety, feel the mysterious breeze of a ninth-month summer.\nWho can match the lute, poetry, wine, and books?\nThis rustic fellow often resembles a dragon in slumber.\n\nGazing Toward Penglai, Five Poems:\n\nThe true Great Dao—\ndiminish and diminish in cultivation.\nWherever you go, people revere and offer sustenance,\nyet gaining advantage is but losing advantage,\nstep by step sinking into the mire.\n\nFor the impoverished man—\nabide in tranquility, do not stray.\nOutwardly, let your demeanor inspire awe;\ninwardly, silently gather the numinous fungus.\nSoon you will meet your master’s appointed time.\n\nAgain—\n\nHear this counsel—\nfew matters need the lord’s attention.\nStriving endlessly for all things harms only yourself;\ngaining advantage is but losing advantage.\nCleverness cannot compare to simplicity.\n\nIn true cultivation,\nseek nothing beyond the heart.\nOnly the present moment lies before your eyes;\nnaturally, vexations will not follow.\nStep by step, enter non-action.\n\nAgain—\n\nWalk the Great Dao,\nrecognize Kan and Li.\nAt the inverted point where the single spark arises,\ntwofold signs reveal their secrets.\nThe mystery is not hard to know.\n\nSeek not without—\nawaken to your own bodhi.\nWithin the body of form, refine through tempering;\non the path of non-action, realize the Muni.\nSoon you will mount the clouds.\n\nAgain—\n\nThe wondrous perfection of the Complete Truth—\nno self, no others.\nNo action, no striving, beyond sight and sound,\nhumble, gentle, and yielding, without estrangement.\nIn solitude, uphold pure poverty.\n\nIn the profoundest depths,\neach attainment is a fine cause.\nThe single spark of non-arising is true freedom;\nserene and ever still, originally real.\nWhen merit is full, join the immortals’ ranks.\n\nAgain—\n\nPerpetual Truth’s Child,\ndaily turns in ceaseless seeking.\nFollow your lot, follow conditions to dissolve past karma;\nidle sorrows and idle vexations all cease at once.\nThe bright moon shines over the mountain’s peak.\n\nEver clear and still,\nno attainment, no cultivation.\nFree, beyond the bounds of cause and effect,\ncarefree and transcendent, escape the sinking stream.\nWhen merit is full, reach Penglai’s shores.\n\nThree Poems on the Flower-Strewn Path\n\nThrough the master’s grace, I crossed the bitter sea,\nleft the worldly to explore the profound mystery.\nSuddenly dwelling in the land of joy,\nI recognized poverty as leisure’s way.\nRight and wrong, self and others—\nwhat matter wise or foolish?\nStep by step on the cool, clear path,\ntrusting in free wandering,\nwho knows such serenity?\nNo heart to gaze afar at immortals—\nwhen the time comes, follow conditions as they flow.\n\nYao’s reign brought harvests rich and full,\nthanks to august Heaven.\nWater and clouds my livelihood,\nseeking but a single coin.\nDiminishing, ever at ease in idleness,\nsilent and without striving,\nletting years and months stretch on unbroken.\n\nAgain—\n\nAs the Double Ninth arrives,\nclouds and waters drift to the edge of the sky.\nDao-friends invite me to drink,\nadmiring the yellow chrysanthemums.\nEspecially for this refined gathering,\ngazing south toward emerald mists and rosy clouds.\nEyes straining through the mountain haze,\ndimly discerned in the distance—\nimmortal dwellings deep in auspicious clouds.\nFreely, merrily, drinking and reveling,\nlaughter and boasts rise like leaping fish.\nBefore the goblet, only wine brings joy—\nwhat more could one desire?\nFloating gold ripples,\nsilently gathering the numinous blossom.\nDrinking done, yet urged again,\nno return until drunk,\nas the bright moon first climbs the window gauze.\n\nAgain—\n\nAbove, no tiled roof of three,\nbelow, not a plow’s worth of land.\n\nA true livelihood of water and clouds—\njust follow conditions as they come.\nHands outstretched in the street,\nalms sought from those with karmic affinity.\nThis \"affinity\" bears the hidden meaning.\n\nReturning alone at dusk,\nten thousand miles of cloudless sky—\nlying down to hear tigers roar and apes cry.\nLeisurely, at ease, boundless true joy,\na surging spring of numinous qi.\n\nThe true fire descends in the crucible,\neternally congealing the lead.\nTiger and dragon coil and entwine,\ntrue essence rooting in the source.\n\nSitting in silent non-action,\nalone guarding the solitary peak—\na single bright moon flows across the heavens.\n\n*Five \"Pounding Silk\" Songs*\n\n*Pounding Silk*—\nwhat does it hold?\nPast sins and karmic debts\nslowly ground away.\n*Luoli suo, lisuo luo.*\nFrom the first attainment,\nrecognizing *pāramitā*.\nSense pleasures and wealth shattered—\nlike moths to a flame.\n*Luoli suo, lisuo luo.*\n\nAgain—\n\nListen to the explanation,\nthis \"wind brother.\"\nUsually just so much *luoli luo*.\n*Luoli suo, lisuo luo.*\nA few words—\nno need for more.\nWhen the wise understand,\nthey laugh *hehe*.\n*Luoli suo, lisuo luo.*\n\nThe pure Dharma transcends the mundane,\nthe divine vessel steadily ferries across sinking waves.\n*Luoli suo, lisuo luo.*\nAct swiftly,\nemerge from the river of delusion.\nIf they still do not awaken,\ntime slips by in vain.\n*Luoli suo, lisuo luo.*\n\nAgain—\n\nFleeting glory,\na dream in Nanke.\nYears flash like lightning,\nrolling down the wheel’s slope.\n*Luoli suo, lisuo luo.*\nBreak free early,\nescape the whirlpool.\nSun and moon race like shuttles,\ntwo losses in a row.\n*Luoli suo, lisuo luo.*\n\nAgain—\n\nThe wind-borne singer chants,\na song to shatter delusion.\nTurn your heart—\nmeet Maitreya with me.\n*Luoli suo, lisuo luo.*\nTen *Pounding Silk* songs,\nmust harmonize.\nKindness, love, and desire—\nthese are the demons of enmity.\n*Luoli suo, lisuo luo.*\n\n*Three \"Han Palace Spring\" Songs*\n\nIn the *jiazi* celestial cycle,\nunder a radiant imperial age,\nimmortals descend to the world.\nThe immortal master secretly dispatched me,\nthus I journeyed east through mist and waves.\nMountains distant, roads far,\ncrossings arduous—how could I refuse the long trek?\nOnly this念念:\neach person yet unenlightened,\nvainly clinging to household schemes.\n\nThe wheel of rebirth is bitter—\nawaken and reflect.\nObserve the ancients’ methods,\nhow they broke free.\nSever worldly ties,\ngradually drawing near the profound Dao.\nWith merit complete and qi congealed,\nsoon the body ascends to immortality.\nReturning thereafter,\nphoenix and crane guide me\nto the true assembly of Penglai.\n\nAgain—\n\nSeeking the wuwei,\ndelighting in leisure within leisure,\njust this little remains.\nFocus on the present—\npast and future, let them be.\nWalk always in openness,\nfar from wealth and desire,\nfrom human right and wrong.\nRecently thus,\ninner joy untroubled,\nnot a thread of attachment to the world.\n\nDrowsy and silent—\nyet within the formless,\ngrasp the true root.\nLucid and free,\nno use, no action, no holding.\nEverywhere turning back to reflect,\nnaturally the principle shines,\nradiant in every encounter.\nWho understands?\nThe clear wind and bright moon—\nonly two people know their depth.\n\nAgain—\n\nAdmiring poverty and leisure,\nI tempered strength, blunted sharpness,\nembraced softness and harmony.\nWorldly ties suddenly cast off,\nthe lamp of wisdom brightly lit the spirit-chamber.\nThe seven gates turned inward,\nadorned with seven treasures,\nsecretly arrayed.\nTaming the ape and horse,\ncunning and cleverness arise—\nrefine them into another path.\n\nGuard purity and spontaneity,\nabide in wuwei, ever good,\na single stick of heart-incense.\nIn peace and joy,\njade liquid flows in jeweled cups.\nCloud companions, rosy friends,\nlaughing and clamoring,\ngold and jade chiming.\nWhen people depart,\nclouds disperse, mist clears—\nthe limpid moon fills the empty hall.\n\n*Nine \"Longing for Immortals\" (Longing Everlasting) Songs*\n\nDawn longs for immortals,\ndusk longs for immortals,\nyearning for the true master four or five years.\nOnly fearing merit incomplete.\n\nMerit must be complete,\nconduct must be complete,\nmerit and conduct both perfected—\na great immortal.\nCarrying clouds, returning to the grotto-heaven.\n\nAgain—\n\nThe mind races outward—\npainful whips in hand,\nyet with tempered nature, the path is never lost.\nBy fragrant streams, lush grasses thrive.\n\nThe thorn returns,\nthe ox follows,\nas the bright moon hangs high, illuminating the ancient dyke.\nWhen neither man nor ox is seen.\n\nAgain—\n\nGold must be plentiful,\nsilver must be plentiful,\nand the toil of servants, horses, and fields—all must be plentiful.\nYet at departure, karmic debts grow heavier still.\n\nWhat of poverty?\nWhat of wealth?\nWith a heart untouched by all things, what then?\nWhat can the future do to me?\n\nAgain—\n\nThe Daoist’s heart—\ndwells in no-heart,\na carefree, unfettered, pure and tranquil heart.\nA drifting, cloud-and-water heart.\n\nThe heart for fame and gain,\nthe heart of endless greed,\nday and night tormented, enslaved—\nwhen will it ever rest?\n\nAgain—\n\nThe heart of cultivation,\nthe heart of forbearance,\na single expanse of cold, empty detachment.\nA leisurely, useless heart.\n\nThe heart of wrath extinguished,\nthe heart of desire cast away,\nsolitude and poverty align with the sage’s heart.\nThe unborn reveals the original heart.\n\nAgain—\n\nFair as blossoms in bloom,\ndo not wait for fragrance to scatter with the evening wind.\nOnly at the end is emptiness realized.\n\nProfoundly search,\nbreak free from the mundane cage,\nwith fierce resolve, burn all to ash—rise as a world-transcending hero.\nWhen merit is complete, ascend the Three Isles’ peaks.\n\nAgain—\n\nEncountering the wind immortal,\nreceiving the hidden teaching,\nlike tumbleweed on clouds and water, ever at ease.\nThe numinous brightness reveals the original source.\n\nRefine true lead,\nirrigate the pure spring—\nknow that within the gourd lies another heaven.\nAttain carefree serenity.\n\nObtaining return to nothingness,\nmerging with emptiness—\nstill and limpid, as if not there.\nFrom the primordial beginning, nothing more.\n\nPrinciples clarified, emptiness realized,\na single numinous source truly like void.\nRadiance pierces the great void.\n\nAgain—\n\nAttaining the profound mystery,\nawakening to the Three-in-Three,\nfire extinguished, smoke dispersed—wind’s harm silenced.\nIn serene obscurity, preserve the Jade Lad.\n\nPursue leisurely ease,\nrecognize pure simplicity—\none nature wholly like the moon at due south.\nLimpid, the azure pool appears.\n\n*Remembering the Prince—Seven Poems*\n\nThe divine boat steadies its course through dark currents,\nbright moon’s glow—destiny fulfills itself.\nTwo masters nod in silent accord.\nThere is reason:\nten thousand kalpas of rebirth end here.\n\nAgain—\n\nWho truly masters the heart’s submission?\nThe crimson phoenix drives it to drink from jade rivers.\nGuiding the infant, laughing, they dance as one.\nTrimming the silver lamp,\neach thing reveals itself at dawn’s window.\n\nAgain—\n\nFrom the first attainment, grace flows freely,\ntaming tortoise and snake to dwell in stillness.\nA thousand days—elixir complete, forever secured.\nWhat fine cause!\nCarefree and at ease, all affairs cease.\n\nAgain—\n\nHeart free of affairs, qi and spirit harmonize,\nunaware, joyful words overflow.\nThe sword of Dao-steel, ground ever finer.\nWind’s harm, brother—\ncut out the tongue, drive the demons away.\n\nAgain—\n\nWorldly dust clings with wealth and desire’s suffering,\nlove of fleeting splendor enslaves this body.\nAwaken to the numinous source’s single truth.\nCut off greed and wrath—\nthen you are one who has reached the shore’s freedom.\n\nAgain—\n\nNothing, nothing—no, there is something, yet nothing,\nawakening to nothingness, one is no longer foolish.\nDays, months, years wear away the coarse and strong.\nBehold the primordial beginning—\nten thousand rays of rosy light gather the jewel.\n\nAgain—\n\nVast, the bitter sea stretches boundless,\nendless deluded fish sink into black abyss.\nI cast a golden hook to catch the destined.\nThe destined are drawn—\nled aboard the divine boat to pluck jade lotuses.\n\n*Six Poems to the Tune of \"Magnolia with Reduced Characters\"*\n\nThe gate of Complete Reality,\nstill and pure, without contrivance.\nNeither easy nor hard—\nwealth, desire, and ignorance all congeal the elixir.\n\nTrue dragon, true tiger,\nrealms extinguished, mind forgotten—knowing its place.\nLead and mercury transmit,\ntheir union must transcend all boundaries.\n\nAgain—\n\nCarefree and at ease,\ncoming and going without hindrance.\nA single expanse of numinous emptiness,\neverywhere round and bright, nothing obstructed.\n\nNo division of inner and outer,\nluminous through the sands, embracing the Dharma-realm.\nUniversally illuminating, selfless—\nlike the bright moon in autumn’s high vault.\n\nAgain—\n\nHeart mad, intent playful,\nhard to discern truth from falsehood within.\nIntent playful, heart mad—\nsummoning all life’s sins and transgressions.\n\nHeart calmed, intent stilled,\nwithin stillness, wisdom’s power shines clearly.\nIntent stilled, heart calmed—\nthe Dao naturally returns, spirit naturally numinous.\n\nAgain—\n\nMeeting yet not awakening,\nalas, the keen-witted chase desire away.\nNow, time slips by—\nhow can I bear this?\n\nIf one day you arrive,\nregret comes late—embrace the profound Dao.\nReturn early to cultivation,\navoid wandering the three paths and six destinies.\n\nAgain—\n\nA skin-bag of water and clouds,\nlike water, like clouds—ever at ease.\nAt ease, a leisurely person,\nin leisure, seeking the body beyond things.\n\nAct or dwell as you will,\nbeyond form, true emptiness is cultivated in leisure.\nTo find true emptiness—\nonly in the deepest stillness of South Mountain.\n\nAgain—\n\nWhere the dust-heart arises,\nthe path of carefree clouds and water is blocked.\nWhen the dust-heart does not rise,\nform and appearance return to emptiness—monkey and horse subdued.\n\nNow, seeing through—\npreserve heaven’s truth, pass time in leisure.\nTo know heaven’s truth—\na body forged of white jade and yellow gold.\n\n*To the Tune of \"Spring in Wuling\"*\n*For Daoist Li, Breaking the Character*\n\nThe sun urges you, yet you do not heed,\nbeneath it, ever more frantic in greed.\nWithin, often turning, you wound yourself—\nhow could you ever reflect thus?\n\nNurture the numinous root, firmly secure it,\nturn your gaze inward, let it shine.\nIdly drifting, all affairs forgotten—\nwithin, the immortal’s incense burns hot.\n\n*To the Tune of \"Southern Village\"*\n\nChasing nothing in all things,\nthe hare and man alike fret over honor and disgrace.\nWorldly cunning and schemes—all set aside.\nRest, rest—\nfollowing others’ whims brings no freedom.\n\nBest to imprison the self,\nfall into disarray, wander clouds and waters as fate allows.\nBegging to preserve the heart, dissolve old sins—\ncultivate, cultivate—\nlike the inescapable end of life’s limit.\n\n*To the Tune of \"Eternal Joy\"*\n\nTo Marshal Wang the Third of Junzhou\n\nWandering free and at ease,\ntreading the path with steadfast calm—\nlet clouds drift, let waters flow.\nFallen into careless indulgence,\nhair unkempt, face unwashed,\nday after day as if drunk.\nDrifting, drifting, carefree and idle,\nroaming without a tether,\ncoming or going, nothing to bind.\nSeeking scraps to fill the belly,\nwherever night falls, sleep comes unbound.\n\nNone have awakened—\nall their cultivation,\nself-imposed, hard to sever.\nDesire knows no shore,\ntorment in the bitter sea—\nwhen will birth and death end?\nA straw cloak, a bamboo hat,\nfollowing fate as it comes,\nsuch is the Daoist’s livelihood.\nYou and I, still lost in delusion,\nunwilling to let go—\njust remain as you are.\n\nTwelve Poems to the Tune of \"Treading the Grass\"\n\nA cloud-and-water idler,\nindulgent in plain cloth.\nRoaming beyond the world,\ntreading mist and rosy clouds.\nWith heart preserved, begging alms\nfrom dawn to dusk,\ndoor to door, bowing in assent.\n\nWater still, clouds at rest,\nnot swayed by others’ drift.\nMist scatters, fire fades—\nthe joy of cool clarity.\nThis journey to the sacred realm\nreturns once more to emptiness.\nStaff in hand, alone I climb\nthe road to Chang’an.\n\nAgainst repeated warnings, the wise remain unwise—\nwords left behind, mere traces of advice.\nYet in those words, only this plea:\n*Turn back, cultivate anew*—\nnever once did they heed the call.\n\nAwaken early to the wheel’s turning,\nseek swiftly the path of escape.\nDay and night, the two wheels hasten—\nthis life’s glory and rank, a debt from past lives,\nbut where will the fruit of the next life lead?\n\n---\n\nForsaking the worldly, cultivating the Way,\ntranscending dust to return to simplicity.\nSerene and still, thoughts forgotten,\nthe mad monkey and restless horse locked in an empty room—\nonly the luminous source, a single point, held fast.\n\nSeek not the golden elder,\nsearch not for dragon and tiger.\nIn pure leisure, wander freely.\nA wisdom-wind scatters the clouds atop the ridge,\none moon illuminates the path to Caoxi.\n\n---\n\nStep by step, no birth—\naffinity draws near to Chan and the Dao.\nIlluminating the hidden, harmonizing with *Zhuangzi* and *Laozi*.\nFor ten years, the wind immortal sought the primordial,\nnow at last, the cloud-path beckons early.\n\nAwakened to the true self,\nboundless treasures within—\nwhy craft the fruits of karmic leakage?\nA life of ease, my family’s way,\ncarefree and open, my gate’s virtue.\n\n---\n\nHaving attained the cultivation of truth,\none must delve into the mysteries of the profound.\n\nAll matters in the heart, forgotten and cast aside.\nBy the master’s wondrous guidance, the primordial origin is realized—\na single point of radiance rises atop the mountain.\nA life of carefree wandering,\na livelihood of water and clouds.\nRoaming freely, at ease within the red dust,\nlords and nobles, do not marvel at this wind-borne man—\nordinary as this, merely so.\n\n---\n\nFoolish and simple,\nwordless, speechless.\nAshamed of vain distinctions idly made.\nFrom now on, no more running outward—\nwithin, the subtlest wonder favors the clumsy.\nGather the spirit, roll up the scroll,\nconceal brilliance, erase traces.\nAll vexations born of emptiness cease at once.\nIn Jetavana’s garden, plant jade blossoms—\na single fragrant golden lotus takes form.\n\n---\n\nNo sooner do spring flowers appear\nthan autumn’s moon arrives.\nSpring flowers, autumn moon—when will they end?\nI urge you: awaken swiftly, do not waste time.\nWithin the gourd, another fine season awaits.\nSever love, transcend the dust—\nbe fierce and resolute.\nRefine primordial yang, delve into the mysteries’ secrets.\nPolish the spirit-pearl, let it not grow dim—\nno coming, no going, beyond birth and death.\n\n---\n\nEndure humiliation, eat plain fare,\nforever forsake impure wine.\nCleanse the heart, purify the mind, forget all existence.\nIncrease and decrease—emptiness is realized,\ncalm and steady, no other path.\nStill and clear,\nenduring as heaven and earth.\nHold fast to spring flowers and autumn moon.\nPress onward, unshaken and upright,\nsilent and wordless, lips sealed.\n\nA single mystery-pearl,\nlong shrouded in darkness.\nGreed, wrath, and delusion stain it—hard to dissolve.\nSudden cultivation washes it clean, never to dim;\nthe wheel of rebirth and death poses no obstacle.\nHasten in practice, never slacken,\nendure with unyielding patience.\nWhen the heart is fully realized, where lies the return?\nA crane leads through colored clouds to Penglai’s gathering.\n\n*For Zhao Liushi of Xingping*\n\nA hundred years of glory,\nstars shift, light fades.\nThe human body scarce endures from dawn to dusk.\nKindness and love now gathered empty,\nthe final hour soon parts all.\nAwaken early to rebirth’s

forge the treasure of long life?\nClouds and waters seek truth,\ncarefree, they wander in search of the Dao.\nTo leave home is to leave sorrow behind.\nIf wisdom awakens and the heart rests,\nyou’ll drink aged pántáo on a solitary peak.\n\n*For Marshal Wang the Third*\n\nI bow to you, Lord Wang,\nbrief words I offer.\nFrost touches your temples now in twilight years.\nWhen will clinging to love and kindness cease?\nA healthy, idle body—best to still the heart.\nProfound truths lie hidden,\nworldly cares are upside-down.\nIn solitude and ease, delve into the mystery’s depths.\nWalk with water and clouds to seek Danyang,\ndrink aged pántáo on a solitary peak.\n\n*For Wang Silang of Xunzhou*\n\nBrother in virtue arrives, speaking of your depths—\nI hear and suddenly sigh in admiration.\nOne mother’s three branches betray long-held bonds,\nhow could the heart bear such change?\nRegret past wrongs, amend conduct with skillful means.\nWisdom awakens, understanding dawns—\ncome swiftly to meet face-to-face.\nWith you, elder brother, I’ll feast in joyful countenance.\nShould even slight discord arise, the Wind Master will resolve it,\nsurely smoothing all entanglements.\nWater and clouds depart—no more parting meetings.\n\n*To the tune \"Sand of the Washing Stream\"*\n*Farewell to Lord Jia*\n\nClouds and waters drift beyond the mundane,\nfishing alone with a line from the great divine boat.\nLost in the bitter sea of delusion, yet never swallowing the hook.\n\nReturning to the jade-green waves, homeward bound,\nreuniting with Ma, Qiu, Liu in the homeland’s mountains.\nA jade

the Eastern Sea.\nOnly to deliver Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma,\nbranching into separate streams—Wang and Hao first transmitted.\nHenceforth they depart,\ngathering on the Ten Isles in immortal assembly,\nwhere cloud companions unite in nature’s harmony.\n\nAttaining immortality—\nneither difficult nor easy.\nEight hundred deeds of cultivation,\nthree thousand merits fulfilled.\nAwaiting the purple decree from celestial script,\nwhen nature and life are whole.\nTo emerge from the shell of yin and yang,\never unstained, all things without flaw.\nTruly enlightened,\ntortoise and serpent entwined,\nyin exhausted, one ascends to the primordial origin.\n\n*End of the Lower Scroll of the Water and Cloud Collection*\n\n*Postscript:*\n#1 This tune pattern should be \"Treading the Sand in Shifted Mode.\"\n#2 This lyric was composed by Liu Chuxuan, not by Master Tan.\n\nAmid heaven and earth, humans stand—\nround of head, square of foot,\nbearing consciousness, containing

prepared.\n\nShould one cast aside cravings,\nforsake frivolity,\nsever greed,\nrenounce fame and profit,\nand still the breath in tranquil emptiness,\nthen may one attain longevity and enduring vision.\n\nThe immortal Master Tan of Changzhen,\nby virtue of karmic affinity,\nin his prime encountered the Patriarch Chongyang.\nWith Danyang, Changsheng, and Changchun, he shared the same master.\nLater, following the Perfected One,\nhe journeyed west to Bianliang,\nwhere the oral transmission was bestowed.\nThereafter, in Luochuan,\nhe accumulated merit and cultivated conduct,\nfirst transcending the world to ascend in truth.\n\nHis surviving recorded words and verses,\nthough but a few hundred,\nall enfold wondrous efficacy,\nprobing the workings of creation.\nEntitled *Water and Cloud Collection*,\nthey have long circulated throughout the land.\nYet in the bingwu year,\na great flood in Jun Prefecture\nwashed away the printing blocks.\n\nUpon hearing this,\nthe immortal and long-lived Master Liu\nwas deeply grieved.\nHe promptly ordered craftsmen\nto re-engrave them at the Quanzhen Hall in Donglai.\nNow, after years of warfare,\nnone in the realm remain intact.\n\nLu Qian, styled Gaoyou, and his wife Meng Changshan,\ntheir entire household diligently devoted to the Dao,\ntraveled between Huai and Chu,\nseeking the Perfected One’s lost manuscripts.\nAt last, from a disciple’s keeping—\nas if by divine bestowal—\nthey recovered the complete volume.\nFearing this text might vanish forever,\nthey once more commissioned its carving and printing\nat the Western Hermitage in Shanyang City.\nTruly, one sees how deeply Master Gao cherishes the teachings.\n\nAlas! The Perfected One ascended long ago,\nand such writings can never be recovered.\nHaving seen the preface composed by my late father,\nI was further entrusted to append this postscript.\nThus, despite my crude and barren words,\nI offer this account.\n\nOne day, as I was compiling and arranging the *Pearl and Jade Collection*—a gathering of immortal-descended verses and hymns—suddenly, banners tall as forests and standards grand as clouds stood arrayed before my humble gate. Startled, I rose to greet the visitors at my door, only to find it was Master Xiao, come once more to cast his gaze upon me. We bowed and entered together, whereupon he addressed me, saying:\n\n“Recently, a fellow Daoist, Zhang Zhiquan, journeyed thousands of *li* without regard for distance to bring me *The Water and Cloud Collection*, a work compiled by Master Tan, the Long-Realized One, during his lifetime. Though I am unlearned in letters and unworthy of my place in the teaching, I hold it in deep reverence. Yet after repeated wars and fires, nearly all the printing blocks of the profound and wondrous writings of the Complete Perfection tradition have been burned to ashes. Only this collection survives, fortunately preserved within a wall by some devoted soul. If we do not carve new blocks and disseminate it widely, I fear it may vanish entirely, leaving future seekers of the Dao with nothing to study or seek. I beg you to compose a preface for its reprinting.”\n\nI replied, “In the past, the father and son scholars of Dongmou, Fan the Rectifier of Learning—men of towering talent, ardent devotion, and vast learning—have already written a preface for it. How dare I presume to add anything?” Though I repeatedly declined, I could not escape his earnest request. Thus, I offer these scattered words merely to fulfill his noble command.\n\nOn the Double-Yang Festival of the *jichou* year.",

      "translated_text": "**The Water and Cloud Collection**\n\n*Scripture Title:* *The Water and Cloud Collection*. Composed by Tan Chuduan of the Jin dynasty. Three juan in length. Source text from the *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Taiping Section.\n\n**Preface to The Water and Cloud Collection**\n\nDongmou was an ancient state of the Muzi, a major commandery of Qi. Its households were vast, and its people simple and unadorned. To the east, it bordered the Bohai Sea, where misty waves and surging clouds stretched boundless, extending for tens of thousands of *li*. To the south, it faced the Kun and Jian mountains, their layered peaks towering into the heavens, rising for thousands of *zhang*. With such a convergence of sea and mountain brilliance, the land was blessed with exceptional talent, and eminent figures and scholars emerged in every generation. It was only fitting that perfected beings and immortals would arise in succession.\n\nMaster Tan, styled Chuduan and known as Master Ever-True, hailed from a prominent family of our homeland. From birth, he was keenly perceptive, possessing an extraordinary bearing. Skilled in cursive and clerical script, he was upright and principled, earning the respect and awe of his village. In the *dinghai* year of the Dading era, the Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct and Compassionate Transformation, Chongyang, arrived in the east, his pilgrim’s staff alighting upon the shores. Drawn by past karmic affinities, he sought out old friends. In our homeland, he encountered Master Danyang (Ma), Master Ever-True (Tan), in Donglai Yishui, Master Ever-Living (Liu), and in Dengzhou Qixia, Master Ever-Spring (Qiu). They became a spiritual family beyond the world, known as the Four Masters: Tan, Ma, Qiu, and Liu. Together, they followed the Perfected One’s travels, journeying west to Yimen. There, the Perfected One entrusted them with oral instructions, charged them with future affairs, and then departed this world to ascend as an immortal. After the four completed the burial rites, they led their disciples west to Zhongnan Mountain, the former retreat of the Perfected One. There, they transmitted and inherited his Dao for over a decade. Thereafter, each went their separate ways.",

      "translated_text": "Master Ever-True wandered along the Luo River, transforming and delivering people through his teachings. Wherever he went, followers gathered like clouds. His compositions—odes, rhapsodies, poems, hymns, and lyrics—flowed effortlessly from his brush, numbering several hundred pieces. He also authored *Recorded Sayings* and *The Song of the Skull’s Liberation*, awakening the world with their warnings. All his works concealed wondrous efficacy, expounding the true wind of the Dao, guiding people toward goodness, and bringing great benefit to the age.\n\nAbbot Wang Liuhui of Quanzhen Hermitage in Junzhou and others carved printing blocks to publish and disseminate his teachings far and wide. In the bingwu year, a great flood swept them away, scattering the blocks and causing their loss. Master Ever-Living of Yishui, Liu, moved by compassion, opened the path of expedient means and dispatched his disciples Xu Shoudao, Li Daowei, and Yu Wuxian to my hometown, entrusting me with a preface. They wished to commission craftsmen anew to carve the blocks and ensure the teachings’ enduring transmission—truly the intent of a benevolent heart.\n\nI once reflected that Master Ever-True and I were from the same village, of similar age and like-minded in youth. As children, we played together; as adults, we traveled as friends. Yet in middle age, he met his teacher, studied the Dao, and shed his mortal form to ascend as a perfected being. Meanwhile, I, with graying temples and hoary hair, still toil in the arena of fame and profit, content to await my end, declining with the world—how foolish I have been!\n\nI shall now cast off my restraints, relinquish the old ox’s love for its calf, and abandon the great rat’s fear of others’ greed. I will roam freely in the realm of self-attainment, laughing and wandering in the realm of true leisure. I will study the Master’s Way, recite his writings, and nurture the harmony of heaven to spend my remaining years. I wonder if, in days to come, the Master might recall our old companionship and deign to lend me his rosy clouds as a sash.\n\nAlas! The Master has already taken flight as an immortal. Later scholars will never witness his steps nor hear his voice. Yet his profound mysteries, wondrous principles, and enduring example remain. By carefully savoring these writings, they may yet grasp them.\n\nOn the full moon of the first month in the dingwei year of the Dading era, this preface was written by Fan Zede Yu, Instructor of Dongmou Prefecture.\n\n*Collected Works of Water and Clouds, Volume One*\nComposed by Master Ever-True of Kunlun Mountain, Tan Chuduan",

      "translated_text": "**Seven-Lawregulated Verses: Inscribed at Chaoyuan Palace in Luoyang**\nThe palace gates stand still, sealed in auspicious mist,\nYet ancient traces and sacred marks remain as if present.\nClouds shroud linked branches where the alchemical cauldron boils,\nRosy dawns rise from the numinous well to irrigate the elixir spring.\nThe sun’s essence refines the land of Huaxu,\nThe moon’s spirit gathers the realm of endless day.\nSince the Purple Edict summoned the Perfected away,\nWho now shall succeed as the Great Luo Immortal?\n\n**Visiting Ling Mountain Temple**\nLeisurely I wander clouds and waters to seek the Chan grove,\nJade-like bamboo glows thickly against emerald peaks.\nThe Jade Pillar Peak stands high, unstained by dust,\nLing Mountain Temple hides where few may find its realm.\nWhite snow blends in even drifts like jade spread,\nGolden blossoms scatter amidst yellow flowers.\nOn an autumn night by the limpid ancient pool,\nOsmanthus blooms alone reveal the original heart.\n\n**Visiting Magistrate Liu’s Garden**\nA host of worthies invites me to admire the fragrant bloom,\nAfter rain clears, I pass alone through the bright gate.\nBy the balustrade, peonies vie in splendor,\nAround the courtyard, butterflies contend in lofty flight.\nThe wind stirs willow eyes with ruthless intent,\nThe rain washes flower hearts clean of right and wrong.\nAll things merge into spring’s single qi,\nSelfless, it scatters its fragrance everywhere.\n\n**Presented to the White-Haired Elder Guo of Xinzhong**\nHow many ever reach the white-haired elder’s state?\nBirth, aging, sickness, and death mark the beginning and end.\nFoul impurities and rank desires shorten lifespan,\nWhile greed and envy turn the mind to darkness.\nLove and hate make transcending the world difficult,\nDesireless and passionless, one attains liberation.\nFortunate that paths to heaven and hell exist—\nSages and fools, delusion and awakening, all rest with you.\n\n**Presented to Immortal Cheng of Yunyang**\nThe greatest fear in cultivation is stubborn bronze,\nFor one clad in stubborn bronze gains no merit.\nWhen the heart stirs with false dust, one sinks to the underworld,\nWhen the mind abides in purity, one walks the celestial palace.\nYou must emulate Yanzi’s joy in poverty,\nNot crave Deng Tong’s wealth and greed.\nLearn from Master Ma of Zhongnan,\nWho dwelt in utter destitution within the ring.\n\n**Presented to Immortal Zheng**\nLeaving the world, he dwells in a hermitage beyond things,\nSilently cultivating, erasing traces, ceasing all debate.\nWondrously he purges filth, delighting in pure poverty,\nUsing clarity to wash away ignorance, content with plainness.\nHis thatched door stands unbarred—what hinders him?\nA single gourd suffices to quench greed.\nCalm and still, he sits in effortless ease,\nPiercing through the three lights of sun, moon, and stars.\n\n**Presented to Young Master Han on Cultivating the Dao at Home**\nUphold truth, initiate goodness, establish the mysterious hall,\nDiligently offer incense morning and evening.\nWithin, serve your widowed mother with filial devotion,\nWithout, uphold integrity to align with the Three Lights.\nAlways act with compassion to lift the poor and distressed,\nFrequently extend mercy to relieve those in misfortune.\nIf one day your wisdom awakens,\nYou too shall return to the immortal realm.\n\n**Presented to Disciples Anranzi and Others**\nThe Master’s subtle words enlighten all,\nDo not idly exhaust qi and spirit.\nTo seek the treasures of the sea’s depths,\nRefine the mountain’s summit to eliminate the slightest flaw.\nThe heart chasing worldly passions harms qi and fire,\nThe mind wandering in craving injures the spirit’s blade.\nI hope you awaken early to the illusory world,\nAnd avoid another cycle in the human realm.\n\n**Presented to the Eighty-Year-Old Daoist Nun Yang**\nSeeking the mysterious, the eighty-year-old Daoist nun Yang,\nA jade-like flower blooming after autumn’s frost.\nHer jade cup brims with water of purity and stillness,\nHer golden censer must glow with fragrant wisdom.\nNow she has secured future blessings,\nHenceforth, what doubt remains of past misfortunes?\nIn the serene and empty hall, free from obstruction,\nThe precious cauldron naturally reveals rosy light.\n\n**Inscribed at Master Kong’s Hermitage**\nThe empty gate stands silent, sealing the numinous spring,\nDelighting in the spring’s profound mystery upon mystery.\nSecluded, it often draws idle visitors,\nIn quietude, it shares its abode with the sleeping phoenix.\nThe cool and pure realm transcends the dusty path—\nOnly by treading here does one know another heaven exists.\nIf the seeker is willing to look in lowly places,\nThey shall suddenly behold the immortal.\n\n**Presented to Marshal Wang of Junzhou**\nNoble Wang delights in the mysterious current,\nUrging me earnestly to invert the jade cup.\nGoodness accumulates gradually from the heart,\nMerit must be sought within one’s nature.\nBenefiting others while diminishing the self reveals true principle,\nEnduring insults with compassion unlocks wondrous depths.\nEquanimity and harmony are the great Dao—\nThree shall ascend together in the divine vessel.\n\n**Inscribed at Yunxi Hermitage**\nAt Yunxi, the recluse lies amidst mist and rosy clouds,\nSilently drinking the sun’s essence and moon’s radiance.\nMists disperse from the cinnabar terrace, revealing auspicious herbs,\nClouds gather around the numinous crucible, forming jade-like blooms.\nThe Azure Dragon exhales fire to brew golden tea,\nThe White Tiger digs springs to irrigate jade sprouts.\nWhen dragon and tiger unite, the work completes nine cycles,\nA single grain of the elixir holds cinnabar’s treasure.\n\n**Expressing My Aspirations**\nI admire poverty and leisure to explore the wondrous mechanism,\nThus knowing my body enters the realm of white clouds.\nCarefree beyond the world, I transcend the dust’s net,\nUnfettered within, I shed the garment of defilement.\nFearing harm to hidden merit, I examine my faults,\nAnxious to avoid moral injury, I shun others’ blame.\nWhen the nine-cycled cinnabar elixir is complete,\nI shall invite the Three Immortals to return with me.\n\n**Again**\nBlunting sharpness, subduing strength, I become good,\nSuddenly both heart and method are forgotten.\nIn the cauldron, the vajra flame frequently rises,\nIn the furnace, the prajna incense perpetually burns.\nThe jade elixir first blooms—only I gather it,\nThe immortal peach ripens—I taste it first.\nDo not say the land of Huaxu is distant,\nIn perfect emptiness, the path is not long.\n\n**Again**\nA single shortcut leads to the immortal source,\nAt the cave’s mouth, numinous clouds veil the verdant peak.\nWhen winds and waves arise, wield the sword of wisdom,\nWhere the mysterious waves settle, pluck the golden lotus.\nThe dragon subdued, it sleeps in the Li palace,\nThe tiger captured, it rests in the Kan chamber.\nWhen these two are pacified, worldly affairs end,\nWith merit complete and conduct fulfilled, the embryonic immortal is born.\n\n**Again**\nLonging for the immortal source’s enduring scenes,\nI purify the numinous land and spread jade-like fragrance.\nThe Red Child of the Southern Palace dwells in the cool hall,\nThe Black Tortoise of the Northern Sea resides in the crimson chamber.\nIn the Pure and Still Grotto, the White Tiger is imprisoned,\nOn the Effortless Mountain, the Azure Sheep are herded.\nSince the clouds gathered within the cauldron,\nI perpetually drink the divine nectar, lying in drunken bliss.\n\n**Again**\nThe Daoist’s home is desolate and free,\nEmbracing weakness, following conditions, passing the years.\nAgainst the cold, coarse robes of paper suffice,\nTo sate hunger, plain rice with greens will do.\nForgetting words, distant from worldly ties,\nAbandoning thoughts, the Dao’s profundity grows.\nThose attached to wives, children, fame, and profit—\nWhen their limits approach, their regrets shall be as thick as hemp.\n\n**Again**\nThe celestial mechanism runs deep, few comprehend it,\nA single grain of the elixir is held at noon.\nMists roll back from the ancient pool on an autumn night,\nClouds gather from the green peaks in the moon’s glow.\nThe dragon is seized and imprisoned in the lofty cauldron,\nThe tiger is captured and bound in the Kan pool.",

light,\nRoaming beyond the world, one with the immortals.\nThe nature shines like the bright moon flowing through the azure sky,\nThe heart drifts like idle clouds across the boundless blue.\nThe fierce tiger is captured and imprisoned in the Kan gate,\nThe dragon is subdued and bound in the Li palace.\nThe vajra flames rise repeatedly through the celestial cycle,\nForging within the furnace a single crimson grain.\n\n**Again**\nA luminous point illumines the towering terraces,\nClearly realizing non-arising, transcending coming and going.\nOn the Seven Treasures Mountain, the crimson flames are extinguished,\nIn the sacred land of the Three Palaces, the white lotus blooms.\nThe purple court of mist and rosy clouds draws near,\nThe cloud-path to Yingzhou is left behind, never to return.\nWho shares the portion of the never-night Jade Capital?\nThe Four Companions attend the Ever-Spring Immortal.\n\n**Again**\nA green serpent, three feet long, carried in the sleeve,\nA single grain of cinnabar coalesces at the proper hour.\nMists shroud the clear deep, imprisoning the colt,\nSmoke veils the verdant peaks, binding the ape.\nAfter a thousand mornings, the dragon leaps into fire when the work is complete,\nAfter nine revolutions, the tiger enters the pool when the merit is fulfilled.\nSeizing the true creation of emptiness,\nThe celestial mechanism runs deep, few comprehend it.\n\n**Again**\nDesire’s cunning surpasses defilement and idle speech,\nAwakening to this, one departs from all extremes.\nTo sever desire and forget emotion is to grasp the wondrous principle,\nSmoke disperses and fire dies, attaining the profound mystery.\nMouth agape, tongue raised—how can the work be accomplished?\nThoughts arise, heart stirs—how can the path be perfected?\nCutting off worldly ties, nothing remains,\nIn desolate solitude and quiet simplicity, one passes the remaining years.\n\n**Again**\nTrue practice, true conduct, arranged in secrecy,\nTen years of diligent care, nurtured with utmost devotion.\nThe mind forgets worldly realms, transcending the other shore,\nWorldly passions and thoughts perish, arriving at Penglai.\nThe buried

ashes.\n\n**For Disciples**\nLeaving the secular home to enter the Daoist’s,\nIs like treading mist and rosy clouds from level ground.\nIn the world of dust, time is fleeting,\nWithin the immortal’s gourd, days and months stretch long.\nThe carefree life of drifting clouds and waters is true livelihood,\nEmptiness and purity are the virtuous way of life.\nConstantly observing desirelessness, worldly ties grow distant,\nUnawares, the great cinnabar coalesces within the furnace.\n\n**Again**\nHold to the One, truly abide, recognizing inner tranquility,\nDiligently and arduously practice, refining the heart to uprightness.\nThe path to the Mystery Origin is not easy,\nYet within the square inch, no dust—this is not difficult.\nIn the twelve hours, remain ever vigilant,\nWithin the three thousand merits, do not deceive or slacken.\nIf you seek the path ahead without coming or going,\nDeeply contemplate the view of no-self, no-person.\n\n**Again**\nSubdue strength, temper sharpness in cultivation,\nExtinguish the self, subdue the heart, sever worldly ties.\nSilently polish, removing cleverness and eloquence,\nDrowsily forge, casting off ferocity and savagery.\nWhere ignorance arises, the true spirit darkens,\nWhen softness and weakness arise, the Dao-eye brightens.\nEach battle with ignorance is waged,\nEach act of endurance is a victory.\n\n**Again**\nEradicate evil, remove passions, act with goodness,\nBest to forget both fame and profit together.\nOn the mountain’s peak, extinguish the fire of ignorance,\nIn the sacred chamber, constantly add the incense of prajna.\nWhen all dust and grime are removed, the bright mirror appears,\nWhen wasteland is cleared, the jade lotus blooms.\nDo not weary of the distant path of cultivation,\nFor the road to emptiness is not long when fully realized.\n\n**Again**\nIn cultivation, one must recognize the spirit’s source,\nRecognizing the spirit’s source, a single point shines fresh.\nPassions and desires forever severed, transcending the dharma realms,\nIgnorance and anger extinguished, departing from heaven and humanity.\nCease the inverted delusion of clinging to existence,\nDo not stir the dusty heart to taint myriad conditions.\nWithin the emptiness and stillness of the nature, no obstructions,\nNaturally, in leisure, the embryo of the person is born.\n\n**Again**\nIn the empty hall, silently burn the heart’s incense,\nThis is the true Daoist sanctuary of my gate.\nEntering emptiness, seek freedom,\nDispelling afflictions, find coolness.\nThe symbols Kan and Li arrange the furnace and hearth,\nThe hexagrams guide the celestial cycle, refining white and yellow.\nEternally, ceaselessly, follow this practice,\nWhen the work is complete, the nine revolutions yield lead frost.\n\n**Again**\nIn cultivation, do not seek within the dharma,\nClinging to dharma in search brings no freedom.\nRecognize that your own heart is the Buddha,\nWhy exhaust yourself in external wanderings?\nThe spirit’s source, wisdom’s illumination—let dust not obscure it,\nIn responding to things, let no thought linger.\nTwo paths of pure wind open the jade gate,\nA single silver stream emerges from the mountain’s peak.\n\n**Self-Reflection**\nFrom the outset, cutting off love to practice austerity,\nHolding to the One, embracing poverty, my resolve unwavering.\nBamboo hat and sheepskin are constant companions,\nTattered felt and a sack ever follow.\nRich mutton and fine wine hold no allure,\nPlain rice and leftover broth suffice to stave off hunger.\nA wooden bowl, newly acquired by begging,\nStill the same as when I first left home.\n\n**Expounding the Dao**\nRoaming beyond the world like a cloud-and-water immortal,\nA single grain of elixir severs worldly

      "translated_text": "**Wandering the Cloud-Water Path**\n\nCloud-water wandering, a home wherever I stay,\nCareless of the sun and moon as years slip away.\nIn leisure, wisdom’s waters fill the golden crucible,\nIn stillness, the numinous field sprouts jade shoots anew.\nBeneath the sea, red peonies are nurtured to bloom,\nAtop the mountain, white lotuses form in the blue.\nI now reveal the treasure beyond the dust—\nInherent thusness is itself the great elixir sand.\n\n**Again**\n\nCloud-water wandering, an immortal beyond the world,\nLeisurely and still, the original heaven unfurled.\nPreserving the heart, extinguishing the self to unlock the golden chain,\nDiminishing intent, forgetting passion to break the jade lotus’ stem.\nOn the farther shore, searching for the profound and wondrous,\nWithin the sacred mountain, securing a karmic bond most auspicious.\nWhen the elixir is refined through nine revolutions, a pure breeze carries me,\nLoosening the moorings, the prajna boat drifts free.\n\n**Following the Rhyme of Master Hu Zi Jin**\n\nCultivation is neither easy nor hard to attain,\nBeyond the shallow, nurture the true, and know the inner calm.\nHastily flee the scorching fire pit,\nEarly ascend the cool and serene Dao’s shore.\nConstantly observe desirelessness to penetrate the profound principle,\nMarvelous subtlety lies in emptiness, beyond love and stinginess.\nPurity and non-action depend wholly on resolve,\nPreserve the heart, weaken the self, in stillness and solitude.\n\n**Sent to Master Yao**\n\nRevered by all, Brother Tan stands tall,\nYet entangled in heavy sins within the net’s thrall.\nReflecting on past transgressions, karma lessens its weight,\nBut knowing faults yet persisting, sins accumulate.\nA heart drawn to greed and desire invites disaster’s blow,\nA mind attached to vanity piles sin upon woe.\nDiminish, preserve, humble yourself low,\nWho knows if the sages will deign to bestow?\n\n**Hidden-Head Character Riddles**\n\n**I**\n□Robes of plain cloth weave subtle patterns deep,\n□Armor of metal, golden stems take flight.\n□Qi intermingles, demanding a change of shell,\n□Elixir refined, one dons new raiment bright.\n□Opening the true nature, every turn is right,\n□Awakening to the original, all else is trite.\n□Nephew studies under the master’s alchemy,\n□Four-petaled lotus steps on clouds in flight.\n\n**II**\n□Head surges with a vast and numinous spring,\n□Profound and limpid, it mirrors the heavens above.\n□The Dao demands the severing of passion and desire,\n□Forgetting realms, a thousand merits accrue.\n□Grasp and seize no more, abandon errant quests,\n□Return to the original, unite with nature’s true.\n□Forged into a priceless chamber,\n□Reunion in the capital with the wind-harmed immortal anew.\n\n**III**\n□Upright and serene, following nature’s way,\n□Within, white lotuses bloom in array.\n□Morning forging refines the boundless chamber,\n□Resolute in true cultivation, ascending heaven’s stair.\n□The Dao severs lingering passions, desires cease,\n□The blade cleaves through karmic ties with ease.\n□Do not cling to the numinous source’s thread,\n□The spiritual embryo’s knotting comes first instead.\n\n**Seven-Character Quatrains**\n\n**Roaming Mount Hua**\nCoarse food and patched robes mark the passing years,\nHigh among white clouds, hidden in mist’s embrace.\nHeart’s incense rises from the numinous source,\nIn samadhi, the lotus peak blooms ten feet wide.\n\n**Composed at Qimen Town, Where Daily I Prepare Medicine for the Multitude**\nClever in many arts, yet feigning foolishness,\nIn non-action, guarding the One, nurturing the spirit pearl.\nSuddenly awakened, the dream of toil and dust,\nAlone I drink the wine of no-birth, a single gourd.\n\n**Ode to the Solitary Bamboo**\nA jade-green stalk rises from the fragrant thicket,\nUpright in node, hollow in heart—none compare.\nEnduring snow, defying frost through the years,\nNaturally, from time to time, a pure breeze stirs there.\n\n**Ode to the Moon Osmanthus**\nGreen leaves, supple stems, crimson buds unfold,\nSpirit in every blossom, dancing in the clear wind’s hold.\nWith pine and bamboo, it endures the cold’s test,\nClaiming the year’s glory, the work of creation’s behest.\n\n**Ode to the Crane**\nStill and solitary, facing the autumn wind,\nBlack and white distinct, the work of creation’s hand.\nMarvel not at its thousand-year longevity,\nFor atop its crown, the red elixir is grand.\n\n**The Three Teachings**\nThe three teachings have ever been one family,\nDao and Chan in purity differ not at all.\nConfucius walked upright, penetrating the profound,\nThose who awaken ride the rainbow’s call.\n\n**Expressing My Feelings**\nNot knowing to seek emptiness beyond the external,\nDragons and tigers are tamed, their power inverted.\nLazy in morning and dusk at incense and prayer,\nWithin the twelve hours, only the heart is worshipped there.\n\n**Again**\nDim and silent, profound and abstruse,\nIn purity and non-action, guarding nature’s truth.\nThe true nature congeals, aided by true qi,\nBoundless transformations may pierce the sky’s roof.\n\n**Again**\nNow my cloud-water path is my former vow,\nCarefully observing the eight-line verse I avow.\nTo extend years and increase life’s span,\nRefine the golden essence, recognize true compassion.\n\n**Again**\nOn the twenty-ninth day of the month, I drink,\nA hundred years hold thirty-six thousand scenes.\nUnheard in the world are my affairs,\nReturning, I enter the land of drunkenness.\n\n**Again**\nFormerly reckless, fierce, and coarse,\nToday I preserve my heart, hoping karma’s weight grows less.\nWithin the twelve hours, ever vigilant,\nWho knows if heaven and earth will grant forgiveness?\n\n**Again**\nMoths drawn to the lamp’s flame, unaware of the blaze,\nFish lured by fragrant bait—just the same.\nMoths charred, fish rotted—do you know?\nBetter to dwell in Jetavana’s bough.\n\n**Again**\nMasters Tan, Ma, Qiu, and Liu,\nWandering freely, at ease in their practice true.",

Seven *Leijiang Yue* (*Niannujiao*)**\n\nOur school’s three patriarchs—Zhong and Lü, and Hai Chan—\nTransmitted the profound mysteries.\nMaster Chongyang passed down wondrous words,\nLifting us together beyond the Three Isles.\n\nSlowly we seek the true,\nNurturing the numinous root,\nGradually sprouting the yellow sprout of grass.\nWithin the nothingness, there is yet something—\nThe wind of wisdom now bears glad tidings.\n\nA single point, luminous and boundless,\nTraversing the sands of the world,\nEach thing perfectly bright and clear.\nAll varieties of emptiness return to fundamental being,\nInside and out, all inverted and reversed.\n\nThis principle is deep and subtle,\nClear and void, ethereal and distant—\nThe practitioner must arrive.\nIn dim stillness, in silent obscurity,\nEven the wise and sagely know the Way in darkness.\n\n**Again**\nThe Dao of nature,\nEndowed with the primordial root,\nGathers the true and perfect spirit.\nA single point of numinous light, without inside or out,\nBright and penetrating, radiant through the gate of mystery.\n\nStillness and simplicity are most fitting,\nPoverty and leisure are best—\nA carefree place beyond the world.\nEver undimmed,\nAbiding serene in the chamber of spirit.\n\nNo matter how wondrous and unfathomable,\nOne must rely on resolve,\nFirmly securing the primordial yang.\nDiligently refine the celestial true,\nEverywhere turning back to contemplate.\n\nThe lotus blooms within fire,\nThe flame on the mountain’s peak extinguishes—\nTruly, the cause of their meeting.\nThe Wind Immortal reunites,\nTogether roaming the cloud paths of the Three Isles.\n\n**Again**\nThe one numinous true nature—\nWhy did it drift into the mortal womb, the dusty realm?\nSeduced by floating splendor, clinging to love,\nTurning and turning, the true trace grows dim.\nFor kalpas uncounted, it could not escape;\nNow once more it errs,\nPiling sin upon sin.\nThe original form—\nHow can it be discerned and sought?\n\nOne must still both seeing and hearing,\nAbandon emotions like clouds and water,\nBeyond the world, seek the profound principle.\nIn lonely solitude, pure and wondrous,\nWho would care for a withered, toiling body?\n\nSeizing the whirlwind,\nResplendent and radiant,\nSilently refining the golden liquid.\nThe divine elixir shines forth—\nBirth and death, afflictions and cares, all cease.\n\n**Again**\nThe jade flower gradually unfolds,\nUrged by the pure wind,\nGathering the radiant light of golden lotuses.\nThrough kalpas of delusion, all is illuminated,\nStraight through the gate of non-doing.\n\nSeven returns of the light,\nThreefold emptiness awakened and illumined,\nAmidst the golden flowers’ intervals.\nDiligently refined,\nNaturally, the infant and maiden abide.\n\nThis subtle, wondrous truth—\nFrom the moment one begins,\nThe foundation is eternally firm.\nThe lotus forms its jade fragrance, the numinous orchid grows,\nDeeply moved by compassion’s frequent regard.\n\nWithin the tripod, clouds gather;\nIn the furnace, the elixir congeals—\nAfter nine transformations, they meet again.\nFollowing the master’s cloud steps,\nTogether they roam the immortal paths of Peng Isle.\n\n**Ode to Bamboo**\nI love your fine beauty,\nFacing the cloud hermitage,\nPersonally planting a cluster of jade-green stalks.\nEmerald shoots, moist and sleek,\nLeaf upon leaf, stalk upon stalk, tender green.\n\nGradually bearing offspring,\nStill surpassing the mother,\nRoots twisting like coiled dragons.\nIn the rustling wind of night,\nMoonlight shines through, sifting jade.\n\nFitting the recluse’s secluded heart,\nBeside the idle window, a companion,\nNaturally abundant in pure wind.\nNever withering, its substance unlike the crowd,\nHow could it resemble common flowers and trees?\n\nDefying snow, scorning frost,\nHollow-hearted, straight-jointed—\nAll wondrous principles are beyond the vulgar.\nNaturally solitary and simple,\nDaily increasing blessings beyond the world.\n\n**Gazing at the Moon on the Night of the Lantern Festival**\nOn the Lantern Festival’s fine night,\nJust as the full moon,\nSteps westward through the celestial channel.\nThe pale orb hangs in the sky, limpid and deep,\nAlone revealing its cold light, unattached.\n\nBright radiance fills heaven and earth,\nImpartial, illuminating all,\nFor ten thousand ages without flaw.\nLike a precious mirror,\nLuminous, suspended in the vast expanse.\n\nThe crimson towers and jade pavilions of Guye,\nA gathering of immortals,\nPhoenixes alight, clouds descending.\nAuspicious vapors and propitious mists envelop the jeweled halls,\nGold and azure glow intertwined.\n\nDrunk on peaches of immortality,\nRiding the rosy clouds away,\nSleeves trailing fragrant traces.\nFacing Song Mountain from afar,\nA promise within the silver platter.\n\n**On Wine**\nDu Kang discovered the wonder,\nBrewing the true essence of the Three Luminaries,\nClear, pure, and rich.\nThe immortal talent of Li Bai, drinking with abandon,\nOne cup, a hundred fine verses.\n\nThe old man of Mount Dao, carried home drunk,\nThe children of Xiangyang,\nLaughing and singing, clapping in unison.\nTao Qian beneath his hedge,\nDrunk and sleeping outside the Five Willows.\n\nIn Dongli, life and death both forgotten,\nWaiting for guests, cutting hair,\nTao’s mother entertains worthy friends.\nWenju, carefree, fills his cup,\nFragrant wine often opens laughing lips.\n\nRejoicing in the age of Yao,\nThe land of drunkenness, abundant and joyful—\nSuch things were rarely heard of in ancient times.\nThe spring hues of the jade pot\nProlong life’s blessings and years.\n\n**Eleven *Shengsheng Man***\n\nLong ago, my brother Tan,\nBound by family ties and nurturing care,\nAccumulated sins like a mountain.\nThen he met the immortal master in the east,\nTraveling to the Three Isles of the sea.\n\nExhorting the stubborn and foolish toward goodness,\nAwakening to the wheel of rebirth,\nAbandoning love to turn back.\nFollowing conditions, he passed through,\nGuarding purity and meekness,\nWandering as clouds and water.\n\nLater, passing the immortal palace of Huaizhou,\nStrolling through a noble county,\nHe encountered deep autumn.\nGradually entering the cold of severe winter,\nNowhere to take shelter.\nHe could only beg for paper and cloth,\nHoping the various lords would remember a fellow traveler.\nIf they awaken,\nLet them join cloud companions and rosy friends,\nTogether cultivating beyond the world.\n\n**Again**\nLong-Truth bows deeply,\nCovering all worthies—\nIn cultivation, only the heart must be firm.\nDay by day, trembling and cautious,\nEver fearing faults may arise.\n\nPlain and simple, poor and meek,\nNever at ease,\nRefraining from composing verses.\nTrue merit lies in\nCrushing the strong, subduing the sharp,\nIn silent stillness, forgetting words.\n\nIf there is nothing, go door to door begging,\nBefore others, do not display\nBrilliant elegance or madcap airs.\nConceal your radiance,\nSilently refining the elixir field.\nAfter a thousand days of effort,\nThis small matter is secretly transmitted.\nWhen merit is complete,\nRide auspicious clouds to return and attend the Origin.\n\n**Again**\nAt first, learning the Dao,\nEntering the gate of mystery,\nCarefree and wandering beyond the world.\nOccupying a hut day and night,\nInevitably seeking.\nDiligently coming and going,\nEntangled in worldly toil—\nHow could one awaken to true cultivation?\nThis path—\nWhen will merit be complete,\nTo ascend Peng Isle?\n\nSuddenly, vast and clear, a fierce awakening—\nExamining the original, single point,\nWhat idle sorrow is there?",

depart—\nShattering all illusions, then at rest.\n\n**Again**\nChasing fame and profit,\nEntangled in love and desire,\nDrifting in confusion, lost in haze.\nUnaware of fleeting vanity,\nSilently aging the youthful face.\nA hundred years pass like lightning,\nWhen the limit arrives—\nWho will face it with composure?\nRefusing to awaken,\nOnly then do they regret,\nEach one the same.\nSwiftly realize the perilous path ahead,\nTurn back step by step,\nAnd re-enter the immortal sect.\nDon the simple robe and blue headscarf,\nBefriend cloud companions and misty friends.\nCease seeking esoteric wonders outside—\nRecognize the spirit’s source,\nWhere the red elixir blooms like a lotus.\nSeek the true realm,\nRevel in the mountain’s bright moon and clear wind.\n\n**Again**\nVast and boundless, the sea of suffering,\nRiding waves, drifting with the current—\nBest to recognize the escape.\nWife and children, beloved kin,\nAre but karmic foes from past lives.\nIndulging in fleeting vanity,\nSquandering primordial yang\nWithout end.\nWhen the limit comes—\nWhat scheme will you devise,\nTo escape the dark and obscure?\nFailing to awaken to such peril,\nScheming day and night,\nCalculating, craving, pursuing.\nIn an instant, rebirth—\nSinking through a thousand lives,\nTen thousand kalpas adrift.\nSuddenly abandoning, entering the mysterious and wondrous,\nAvoiding the three paths,\nThe six realms of wandering.\nAct swiftly—\nWith wind and beings beyond the world,\nForm bonds with companions.\n\n**Again**\nVast and boundless, the sea of suffering,\nDrifting with the waves, lost—\nFoolish as moths drawn to a flame.\nEver deluded by wife and concubine,\nThe love of children.\nBound by such snares,\nWhen the limit arrives—\nAlone you descend to the Yellow Springs.\nIf you awaken,\nAbandon fleeting love and vanity,\nDwell in quiet cultivation.\nGradually sever worldly attachments,\nNurture the heart, cultivate qi,\nConceal your traces, bury your name.\nCoarse food, plain clothes,\nSilently refine the spirit’s clarity.\nThen the true person manifests,\nFrom nothingness—\nGold and jade take form.\nWhen the great elixir ripens,\nThis single spirit of true nature\nEndures forever.\n\n**To Master Mu**\nThe gate of cultivation—\nFirst, know the sequence:\nSever ties with sons, abandon wives.\nFiercely cast off worldly attachments,\nEmbrace solitude—\nThis is fitting.\nWith nothing, extend your hand in the streets,\nFor warmth, paper and cloth serve as garments.\nGo with the flow,\nUphold poverty, softness,\nQuench the fire, humble the heart.\nIn daily practice, bind the monkey, tether the horse,\nAbide in non-action, purity,\nSilently attune to the true master.\nWhen realms vanish and the heart is forgotten,\nSpirit congeals, qi forms the magic fungus.\nAttaining carefree freedom,\nCompose poems, exhort the deluded.\nWhen merit is complete,\nPoint the way to Peng Isle—\nRide a cloud home.\n\n**To Master Zhao**\nMaster Zhao entered the Dao,\nFiercely embracing the mysterious,\nSevering illusions in sudden awakening.\nFacing circumstances, cultivate without pause—\nThe fire nurtures the lotus.\nI now offer sincere words:\nWhen met with spears and blades,\nReceive teachings with magnanimity.\nIf afflicted,\nDwell in a hut as if dead—\nDo not return home.\nSteadfastly emulate such resolve,\nAs sages and worthies secretly reflect,\nA flawless mirror shines.\nWhen fire fades and smoke clears,\nThe spirit’s crucible yields the yellow sprout.\nSelfless nature stabilizes, life endures,\nThe heart pure—\nJade crystallizes the cinnabar.\nWhen merit is complete,\nAscend Penglai, guided by cranes,\nAmidst cloud-borne banners.\n\n**To Zhang Jiulang**\nHeaven and hell,\nGood and evil arise from the heart,\nLife and death—\nAwakening or delusion, who prevails?\nAwakening, abandoning family ties, forgetting the heart,\nExtend your hand in the streets.\nEmbrace simplicity, poverty, softness,\nWander as clouds and water,\nFree and untethered.\nHold fast to resolve,\nUphold the eternal,\nEnduring without end.\nWhen old karmic debts near their end,\nThe mysteries of sages and worthies\nAre secretly transmitted.\nThe heart pure, the mind clear—\nNaturally, the treasure forms in the elixir field.\nIf even a trace of transgression remains,\nCalamity returns—\nUnspeakable sins.\nWhen all is understood,\nAscend the three isles of Penglai,\nBecome an immortal.\n\n**To Brother Feng of Chang’an**\nExhort others to do good,\nCultivate yourself—\nBoth align with the Dao.\nAvoid the俗世乡土,\nKeep your distance.\nThe wondrous medicine cures deep illness,\nWithout regard for noble or base, high or low.\nNaturally, it follows reason—\nEmulate Master Longxi,\nUphold precepts and practice.\nCultivation demands fierce resolve,\nLike great rivers and mountains,\nSteadfast, unshaken.\nOutward conduct, complete and perfect—\nOne day, attain non-action.\nWandering as clouds and water,\nQi and spirit harmonized,\nMerit and conduct both fulfilled.\nWhen the great elixir ripens,\nPoint the way to Penglai—\nRide a cloud home.\n\n**To Brother Liu of Longevity**\nWith reverence, I bow,\nTo Master Liu—\nThree years have swiftly passed since we parted.\nOften, facing the wind and moon,\nI yearn for your noble presence.\nSuddenly, your teachings arrive—\nNow assured of your well-being.\nI rejoice,\nNo need for formalities—\nMy thoughts endure.\nI regret my worldly ties remain unsevered,\nIn Ci and Luo, drifting with circumstances.\nThe promised reunion unfulfilled,\nForgive this old fool’s shortcomings.\nEarly spring, I shall pay my respects,\nBy late autumn—\nMy plain wishes remain unspoken.\nI, Chuduan, await\nYour profound insights before the altar.\n\n**Six Lyrics to \"Man Ting Fang\"**\nDeceiving to build a household,\nStingy and greedy to amass wealth—\nIn quiet solitude, I ponder.\nRaising those few mouths,\nThe sins are mine alone.\nTime presses like an arrow,\nBlack hair turns to gray,\nYouth fades to age.\nIn a hundred years,\nWho can count them all?\nEndlessly striving, in vain.\n\n**If strong in body,**\nAwaken early,\nRecognize faults, repent swiftly,\nChange your ways.\nIn leisure, carefully\nIncrease blessings, dispel calamities.\nWith lofty resolve,\nCast off worldly bonds,\nWander beyond the mundane.\nCultivation is good—\nRoam mountains, play in waters,\nDaily burn incense in the heart.\n\n**Again**\nMist gathers, clouds disperse,\nThe autumn moon solitary, still—\nProfoundly, the subtle appears.\nEver at ease,\nSilently imbibing the elixir.\nThe precious tripod’s auspicious smoke gathers,\nQi and spirit unite—\nThe magic fungus forms.\nWander freely,\nDrifting as clouds and water,\nBeyond the world, seek kindred spirits.",

Though I am unlearned in letters and unworthy of my place in the teaching, I hold it in deep reverence. Yet after repeated wars and fires, nearly all the printing blocks of the profound and wondrous writings of the Complete Perfection tradition have been burned to ashes. Only this collection survives, fortunately preserved within a wall by some devoted soul. If we do not carve new blocks and disseminate it widely, I fear it may vanish entirely, leaving future seekers of the Dao with nothing to study or seek. I beg you to compose a preface for its reprinting.”\n\nI replied, “In the past, the father and son scholars of Dongmou, Fan the Rectifier of Learning—men of towering talent, ardent devotion, and vast learning—have already written a preface for it. How dare I presume to add anything?” Though I repeatedly declined, I could not escape his earnest request. Thus, I offer these scattered words merely to fulfill his noble command.",
