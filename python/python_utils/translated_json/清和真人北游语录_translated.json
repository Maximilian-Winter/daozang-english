  "full_translation": "**The Recorded Discourses of Master Qinghe on His Northern Journey**\n\n**Title:** *The Recorded Discourses of Master Qinghe on His Northern Journey*\nRecorded by Yin Zhiping of the Yuan, compiled by his disciple Duan Zhijian. Four fascicles.\nSource edition: *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Orthodox Section, Part One.\n\n**Preface to *The Recorded Discourses of Master Qinghe on His Northern Journey***\n\nI have observed how Nanbo Zikui inquired of Nü’ou regarding the hearing of the Dao, who replied that he had heard it from the son of Fumo, and the son of Fumo from the grandson of Luosong, extending through Shanming, Nieshu, Xuyi, and Yu Shu, until reaching Xuanming and Canliao, and finally to the very beginning of doubt. This demonstrates that unless one is born with innate knowledge or perceives the Dao with a single glance, one must rely on cultivating the mind and refining one’s nature, gradually attaining realization through progressive awakening—advancing from daily accumulation to daily reduction, from action to non-action—until the Dao is perfected, immortality achieved, and one abides in the world. Such a process indeed follows a proper sequence.\n\nYet if the teachings of Daoist cultivation, the words beyond words, were to cease, how could they endure? Master Qinghe Yin, the Perfected, transmitted the Dao of his teacher, Master Changchun, and succeeded in overseeing the great teachings of the world. He reopened the gates of mystery, proclaiming and reviving the orthodox tradition, like the auspicious star or the vermilion phoenix, drawing all to eagerly observe his virtue. Within his community, those who cast off their worldly robes and shoes numbered no fewer than a thousand, while beyond, devotees traveled from afar to offer supplies and seek his guidance. His reputation and virtue spread across the Central Plains and the borderlands, and the world unanimously revered him as a master of his generation.\n\nThe Perfected once journeyed to Beijing to conduct the ritual offerings for the Prefectural Envoy Hou Jindao and others. His disciples compiled *The Recorded Discourses of the Northern Journey*, a collection of exchanges between master and disciples, discussing scriptures and doctrines. With earnest clarity, he employed plain language to point to the ordinary mind, upholding the essential principles of the mysterious Dao, and resolving subtle truths—truly a guidepost for entering the Way.\n\nPrefect Du Dekang of Qin Prefecture intended to have the text carved into woodblocks for wide dissemination among the faithful and reclusive scholars of the four directions. Thus, it was arranged into two fascicles, hoping that readers might awaken through its words and together attain longevity. How could this not be commendable?\n\nAlas, now the Perfected has withdrawn from the hall to a life of leisure, sitting in stillness all day, preparing to wander with the Creator in the realm of nothingness. Even his face is no longer seen, let alone his words. On the first day of autumn in the year *qiangyu*, Li Jin of Gutao inscribed this.\n\nFormerly, Confucius once told his disciples, *\"I wish to speak no more.\"* Zigong replied, *\"If you do not speak, what shall we, your disciples, transmit?\"* Thus, the sages invariably conveyed the Dao through words. If it were otherwise, how could the Dao be made manifest?\n\nNow, Master Qinghe Yin, the Perfected, left home in his youth and followed Master Changchun for over fifty years. From morning audiences to evening inquiries, he never rested, standing out among his peers as exceptional. Thus, he was entrusted with the master’s teachings and placed in charge of the school’s affairs, earning the world’s reverence. During moments of leisure, he would expound the wondrous principles of the Quanzhen tradition to the assembly, often discoursing all day without weariness. His words were concise and apt, his explanations of principle readily understood—markedly distinct from those who, in discussing the mysterious or expounding the subtle, merely confuse the crowd.\n\nFearing that his teachings might be lost, his disciples each recorded what they had heard, compiling them into this single volume, entitled *The Recorded Discourses of Master Qinghe*, divided into two fascicles. It is hoped that cultivators of the Dao from all directions may read and study it, thereby more easily entering the Way.\n\nAs the effort to complete the work was not yet realized, he had previously sent a letter to Prefect Du Dekang of Tongchuan, inviting the master to journey south. Upon hearing of this, the prefect was delighted and ordered the text to be block-printed, intending to preserve it for posterity.\n\nOne day, Wang Zhining, the director of Taiping Xingguo Abbey in Pingyao, along with Li Zhifang, earnestly requested that I compose a preface. Though I dared not refuse, I also admired the deep sincerity of these noble gentlemen. Thus, I have briefly recounted the facts to elucidate the work’s origins.\n\nOn the day of the Beginning of Autumn in the seventh month of the ding-yu year, inscribed by the Old Man of Nanxuan, Zhang Tianzuo.\n\nThe Great Dao is without form; the supreme principle is without words. Since the formless Dao cannot be seen, how can the wordless principle be made clear? Yet how is the principle made clear? It is made clear through words. However, when put into words, it no longer resembles itself—thus the noble ones of antiquity were compelled to speak. Their words had a source; with a source, the principle emerges through words as a guide. From this, we know that the principle lies beyond words, and when one grasps the principle, words are forgotten. Hence it is said: the supreme principle is without words. Without words, there is no form—thus it is said: the Great Dao is without form. To perceive the formless Dao and speak of the wordless principle—who but one who has truly attained true knowledge could do so?\n\nOnce attainable, it may be spoken of—expounded at length without excess, summarized without omission. This is what it means to be dynamically aligned with method and statically attuned to the ultimate, merging mysteriously with the Dao. Yet how easily can one encounter such a person in this world?\n\nNow, the Perfected Qinghe has succeeded the Perfected Changchun, presiding over the teachings of the Mysterious, accumulating years of service. Cultivators of the Dao from all directions come daily to his seat seeking instruction, their numbers never waning. With time, their reverence deepens; from afar, their intimacy grows. Those who vie to behold him are as drawn as to the auspicious star or the phoenix. How magnificent is this perfected one! In daily life, he meets all with sincerity and benefits others with compassion. Though he seeks no protection from others, others protect him—truly the refuge of humans and heavens.\n\nOne day, Director Zhang Defang of the Abbey and others presented several fascicles of records from the Perfected One’s northern journey, saying: \"Among the disciples of the late Master Changchun, none knew the master as deeply as you. The trust he placed in you was profound. Now, we intend to carve these writings into woodblocks. If you could compose a preface to spread the aspirations of later learners in all directions, would that not be splendid?\"\n\nI humbly declined, saying: \"What words of mine could be called literature? The Perfected One’s Dao is pure, his learning profound—he is a towering figure of our age. Having truly attained true knowledge, whether speaking or silent, his every word and phrase has long been recorded into books. Why would they need my words to be transmitted?\"\n\nDefang replied: \"Not so. To lift a fur robe, one must grasp its collar; to ascend the hall, one must step upon the stairs. We hope you might lend a single phrase to draw forth the profound and reveal the ultimate, placing it at the beginning of the volume. This would allow learners to lift the robe by its collar and ascend the hall by its stairs—no small aid.\"\n\nI dared not refuse further and thus took up my brush to grant their request.\n\nInscribed in the early autumn of the geng-zi year by Li Zhichang, the Perpetual Teaching True Constancy Master.\n\n---\n\n**Record of the Perfected Qinghe’s Northern Journey, Fascicle One**\nCompiled by Disciple Duan Zhijian\n\nIn the autumn of the gui-si year, at Huayang Abbey in Beijing, the assembly gathered for an evening sitting.\n\nThe Master said: \"Now that the autumn cool has arrived and the nights grow longer, do not retire early. Without waiting for a summons, come together for conversation. There is no need for every sentence to discuss the mysterious and the Dao. Even matters of the ancients’ successes and failures, or the good and evil of the world—nowhere does the Dao not reside. When praising another’s goodness, one admires it oneself; when speaking of another’s wrongdoing, one detests it oneself. With the mind holding admiration for goodness and aversion to evil, there must naturally be a heart that chooses and rejects. If one acts with resolve, one may reach the realm of perfect goodness. If one speaks with benefit, even the listener gains caution and profit. But if the mind wanders carelessly, failing to discern others’ goodness or fault, one’s own conduct will likewise lack discernment. Indulging in habit and expediency, one drifts into evil, never reflecting. Though discussing success and failure, good and evil may not fully embody the scholar’s Dao, it is still beneficial—better than eating one’s fill all day and indulging the heart.\n\nMoreover, the greatest hindrances to cultivation are the three desires: food, sleep, and sensuality. Without moderating food, one sleeps excessively, and sleep is the gravest—it is the source of emotional desires. If learners can first restrain these three desires, they truly enter the gate of the Dao. Though all know this, few can restrain them. Restraint depends on will, while its undoing lies in qi. Will leads qi. When will is weak and qi strong, it cannot prevail. To restrain them, first reduce daytime sleep. Progress day by day, month by month, without seeking quick results. Naturally, turbid qi will not arise, and one will gradually find it easier. When I was in Shandong, I did the same. At the slightest sense of drowsiness, I sought activity. Day after day, by the twenty-fourth or twenty-fifth day, it became effortless, and my mind grew clear and bright. All of you should practice this.\n\nIn learning the Dao, even if one has not yet reached the state of penetrating heaven and earth, first becoming a cautious and prudent noble person is no loss to oneself. Indeed, all great sages and worthies emerge from this. Others only know indulgence as joy, unaware that restraining the heart brings boundless true joy.\"\n\nThe Master said: \"Recently, I have greatly wished to speak less, but due to the karmic conditions of the teacher’s role, I must speak. Yet teaching others brings vast benefit. When I resided at the abbey in Shandong, I practiced a way of generosity and ease, teaching others the same. For over a decade, no disputes arose. In managing a monastery, exhorting the assembly to honor the worthy, embrace the multitude, and live in harmony without contention is truly a field of blessed action. At the time, if one or two among the assembly were disobedient, the vast majority would not tolerate them. I too showed them forbearance, fearing only their downfall. If they risked harming matters, I could not avoid slight reproach, but it was always done skillfully, so they could accept it. Not only did I spare myself distress, but those who had erred could more easily reform.\"\n\nAt the abbot’s hall of White Crane Abbey, the Master sat with the assembly. Someone offered fresh plums, which were shared.\n\nThe Master then recounted an anecdote from the Sui dynasty: \"At that time, the realm was unified, and within the palace, the Three Mountains, Five Lakes, Four Seas, and Sixteen Courts were constructed, planting every rare flower and exotic fruit within them.\"\n\nAt that time, in the western courtyard stood a yangmei tree, which in a single night spread its vines so vast they shaded an acre. Yang was the surname of the Sui, and all took this as an auspicious omen. In the eastern courtyard grew a jade plum tree, which likewise flourished. When they bore fruit, the yangmei proved sour while the plum was sweet, and people abandoned the former for the latter. There was also in the pond a great carp with the character *wang* (king) upon its brow. Later, when the Sui fell and the realm turned to the Tang—whose imperial surname was Li—people then understood the portent.\n\nThus it is known that the rise and fall of dynasties follow a fixed decree, driven by the revolutions of the Five Phases and the shifts of qi, which cannot but be so. All that dwells within yin and yang is bound by fate. Only in heaven, where there is neither yin nor yang, does pure yang abide. Looking down upon the turning of the sun and moon, one sees that time and destiny lie beyond the sway of qi. How then could there be cycles of cold and heat, spring and autumn, prosperity and decline?\n\nYet humans dwell within yin and yang, and so are turned by them, unaware that there exists something beyond their alternations. Those who study the Dao do not contend with things. When matters arise, they pass through them lightly, and when fortune and misfortune, long life and early death, birth and death, transformation and change unfold before them, their hearts remain unmoved. This is to stand beyond yin and yang, to dwell above heaven. In this way, the heart attains constancy, and things naturally align. One roams freely within the world of phenomena yet is not turned by it. First, the heart must be free; only then can things be made equal.\n\nThus the opening chapter of the *Zhuangzi* speaks of the \"Free and Easy Wandering,\" which carries deep meaning.\n\nA disciple asked, \"Is constancy the Dao?\"\nThe Master replied, \"Constancy is true constancy. The heart responds to myriad changes yet is not swayed by things. Abiding in constant response and constant stillness, one gradually enters the true Dao. Constancy is the Dao.\"\n\nThe reason people fail to attain constancy is that their hearts lack a master, and their emotions flow with external things, their qi dissipating through the many apertures. As *Mencius* says of the will, \"The will is the commander of qi.\" If one can command qi with the will and prevent its dissipation, it transforms into radiance, accumulating into great luminosity. The Master’s father once said, \"Great luminosity envelops the golden lotus.\" The lotus symbolizes the heart, where spirit and clarity reside. Only by first attaining constancy can one reach this state.\n\nConfucius spoke of the \"Middle Way,\" which is also the meaning of constancy. There is also a saying: \"Buddha-nature is fundamentally not awakened; sentient beings are originally not deluded. In the ordinary workings of the heart, this is bodhi.\" Those who do not know constancy act recklessly and court misfortune; those who know constancy attain clarity.\n\nThe disciple asked, \"Is there no difference between what the Buddha teaches and what you teach?\"\nThe Master replied, \"In principle, there is no difference. The Buddha’s teachings, my teachings, and even worldly teachings all contain wondrous truth. It is only when one comprehends it in one’s own heart and nature that one naturally perceives it. At that time, even heart and nature are no longer needed.\"\n\nThere is a saying: \"Neither heart nor nature—only when there is no heart and no nature does one attain the divine and the sagely.\" Another says: \"When someone comes seeking the Dao, you must transmit it to one who is enlightened. If a person’s heart is not first open, how can words be conveyed?\"\n\nOn the ninth day of the seventh month, the day of Master Changchun’s ascension, the Seven Perfected Ancestors were enshrined at the Hall of Fragrant Osmanthus in White Crane Abbey, and offerings were made. After the rites, the Daoist assembly sat together and spoke of worldly affairs, rejoicing that their tradition enjoyed peace and tranquility.\n\nThe Master said, \"Today we dwell in safety, eat our fill, and cultivate virtue. How could we not know the source of this blessing? It is because our ancestors possessed extraordinary natural endowments, accumulated vast merit, and awakened to the great Dao. Having perfected themselves, they then perfected others, shaping and refining them. The successive Perfected Masters, one after another, instructed and transformed, illuminating the ground of the heart, exhaustively investigating the roots of sin and fortune. Many attained thorough understanding. Through a thousand trials and ten thousand hardships, their accumulated merit and conduct grew ever greater, enabling the flourishing of the teaching as it is today.\"\n\nMaster Changchun once said, \"In a thousand years, the Daoist tradition has never been as prosperous as it is now.\" Yet the Master spoke with humility, and his words did not fully express it. From the time of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi to the present, the tradition has never been as prosperous—this is the work of heaven’s decree. As the world’s ways gradually decline, heaven raises up sages to uphold it. In high antiquity, governance was through the Dao; later, it was through benevolence and righteousness. As customs further declined, Buddhism entered China, using heaven and hell to exhort the people. Now, in our time, the ancestral masters have arisen to propagate the teaching. Though only seventy years have passed since its inception, the accomplishments are already so great.\n\nThe Perfected Masters established great expedient means to aid the people. Yet after more than twenty generations, Buddhism’s accumulated merit and conduct were profound, and its teachings brought great benefit to the world. Later generations failed to uphold them, leading to decline. This is because when people long enjoy blessings, karma inevitably arises.\n\nAll must deeply understand this and take heed. Recently, I have observed that among our disciples, some sit idly enjoying their blessings, indulging their hearts, and gradually straying from virtuous conduct. This is the beginning of karmic action, and they drift ever farther from the Dao. Human nature is originally not far from the Dao, but through many lifetimes of being submerged in desire, it becomes difficult to return to it. Thus Confucius said, \"By nature, people are close to one another; by practice, they grow far apart.\" If one can be cautious in one’s habits and not be burdened by things, focusing the heart on emptiness, then the teachings one hears will naturally be understood.\n\nAll that I have received as teaching was transmitted orally and received in the heart from the Perfected Masters. I have practiced it to this day, and how could I not wish to pass it on to later generations? Yet few listen with sincere hearts, so I often wish to remain silent. Even those who have heard the teachings, if they do not practice them, are no different from those who have not heard. Teachings are like talismanic registers: if one holds to them, they are efficacious; if not, they are but empty words.\n\nWhat benefit does this bring to either party? Master Liu of Barefoot Old Liu once told me: \"Master Tan should complete the Dao early. When we used to beg for meals together, I saw him examine his heart daily. At dusk, he would review the thoughts that arose from dawn, and each day at noon, he would review the thoughts that arose from the previous night. Day after day, he never slackened in the least.\"\n\nMaster Tan said: \"Master Danyang completed the Dao in two and a half years, Master Changzhen in five, and Master Changsheng in seven.\" My own blessings are meager and my resolve weak; after eighteen or nineteen years, I have only just reached the point of penetrating heaven and earth, where the sages and worthies grant me a small measure of radiance—yet before long, it is taken away again. This I have heard with my own ears.\n\nAs for the merit and conduct he accumulated, the hardships and toils he endured—even the most stubborn and unyielding person would be moved to the heart. Through the accumulation of hardship and merit, great blessings were formed, extending his transformative influence throughout the world. Nowadays, among his disciples, even those whose merit and virtue have not yet reached such heights readily accept his blessings. If one cultivates the heart, keeping every thought on the Dao, or diligently serves and attends to others, this may suffice to dissolve such karmic debts. But if not, one risks losing one’s original nature.\n\nHaving been born in the Middle Kingdom, having encountered the true teaching, and having left behind worldly entanglements—if one does not advance in cultivation but merely enjoys its blessings, how could one hope to enter the Dao again in future lives? If one indulges in blessings to excess, accumulating karmic deeds day by day, not even the human form can be preserved. Is this not losing one’s original nature?\n\nAn ancient saying goes: \"To invite a life of future discontent.\" This is precisely the case. Accumulating good deeds brings blessings; accumulating evil deeds brings karmic retribution. This is not the result of a single morning or evening. People see small good deeds as offering little benefit and so do not perform them; they see small evils as causing little harm and so do not abandon them. Yet when these accumulate, they grow vast and inescapable.\n\nAs it is said: \"Drops of water, trickling little by little, gradually fill a great vessel.\" How could one not be cautious!\n\nThe ancestral masters and all true masters were of one heart and one virtue, establishing this teaching so that the four seas might regard it as one family. Generally, those within our gate share the same gains and losses: when one advances in the Dao, it brings honor to the teaching; when one commits a transgression, it becomes a burden to the teaching. This is especially something one must not fail to be cautious about—only, do not act in ways that belong to the hells. When a person commits a transgression, hell already exists in their heart. The Buddha spoke of Avīci, and also of \"no questioning.\" Our teaching speaks of Dengdu—none of these can be denied.\n\nA Daoist disciple named Nianhe asked: \"I have often inquired about cultivation among fellow disciples. Some teach arduous refinement, while others advocate preserving naturalness. May I ask which is correct?\" The master replied: \"The Dao cannot be transmitted through words. One must first possess it in the heart before one can enter. Even the true masters cannot bestow the Dao upon others; they can only teach the accumulation of merit and virtue as the foundation for entering the Dao.\n\nMaster Changchun once said: 'Dan Yang and I both awakened to the Dao, but to different depths, which is why our attainment differed in speed. Dan Yang directly awakened to death, so his attainment was swift. I awakened to the illusory nature of the ten thousand things, so my attainment was slower. To awaken to death is to immediately regard oneself as dead—just as a violent person, once dead, can no longer be violent. To awaken to illusion is not yet to reach death, for one still engages in scheming and doing, which causes a slight delay.' This principle is not obscure; it is simply that awakening varies in depth, depending on the thickness or thinness of one’s accumulated merit and virtue. Thus, the predecessors never lightly discarded even the smallest act, such as picking up a needle or a blade of grass. The ancients said that even an inch of time is precious; a single moment without merit or practice is a waste. Even a single meal—how can it be repaid?\n\nCultivation must proceed from the coarse to the refined, accumulating the minute to achieve the manifest. Those with strength in the teaching should exert their strength; those with devotion should apply their hearts. Managing affairs and harmonizing the community—all of this is merit and practice. Only then can one’s clothing and food be properly accounted for. In my daily life, when I receive offerings from others, I humble my heart to repay them. When I was first in Weizhou, the old Dragon-Tiger Householder often invited our group of ten or more to stay at his home, providing for us for several months. Before ten days had passed, some among us already felt stifled, even falling ill. They could not even find diversion in playing the qin or chess. Yet I remained at ease, free from care, never once unsettled. This was because I had no fixed heart—moving only in response to fate, gathering in my emotions, never letting them stray outward. Even those who served me closely, I did not recognize their faces or know their names. Moreover, I never ate more than half my fill—how could I not be at peace?\n\nThe human heart must have its attachments, but the danger lies in not aligning them with what is right. If one’s attachments lie in external things, then no matter whether they are good or bad, they lead one astray. If one’s attachment is to the Dao, then this heart is wholly aligned with what is right. Once the heart is right, external temptations and deviations naturally lose their weight. Day by day, they grow lighter, until nothing remains. The karmic consciousness that has followed one through many lives of transmigration and change is then cast aside. Even the desire for the Dao is ultimately relinquished, leaving only vast emptiness—yet within it, there is something that is not empty. Thus it is said: 'Neither existence nor emptiness—this is called true emptiness.' Without cultivating the heart, how can one attain this? Therefore, in cultivation, refining the heart is essential. Once one understands gain and loss, one reverses all worldly affairs in the heart. Then the qi within the body naturally follows, the hundred bones are regulated, the nature comes to rest, the breath is harmonized, the life-force is secured, and one is not far from the Dao of immortality.\n\nYet today’s learners do not follow this path. They open their mouths to speak of the profound and wondrous, often falling into emptiness and delusion, and I have yet to see any who succeed. They then transmit this delusion to others, leading many astray. Everyone knows that immortals are to be admired, yet no one is willing to exert effort in practice. Thus, attaining the Dao of immortality is like hearing that steamed buns are edible: if one truly wishes to eat, one must first plow the fields and sow the seeds. If one were told to seek food in the earth, all would laugh at such folly. Yet in the end, no one obtains food without cultivation. Is the path to immortality any different?\"\n\nThe master said: \"Those who are new to learning do not understand nature and life. They mistake daily speech and action for nature, and the breath entering and leaving the mouth and nose for life—this is incorrect. Nature and life are not two separate things. First, one must exhaust the heart to recognize the true nature before birth by one’s parents; then one will understand the life bestowed by Heaven. The *Book of Changes* says: 'Exhaust principle and fulfill nature, to reach life.'\n\nThe master said: \"Humans observe the qi of the Five Phases to come into being, and thus their natures follow accordingly. For example, the nature of wood is often benevolent, and the nature of fire is often proper—this is the case. Yet none of these are our original true nature. One must transcend the Five Phases to see one’s true nature.\"\n\nMaster Hao Taigu seemed most plain and simple, yet when he received a single meal from someone, he would silently recite ten scrolls of scripture in return. Can later generations afford not to attend to such meticulous conduct? The master visited Youxian Abbey, where the abbot, Li Zhishao, bowed and asked about his doubts regarding the *Wuzhen Pian*. The master did not answer.\n\nThat night, seated among his disciples, the master addressed them: \"Zhang Ping Shu’s lifelong accumulation of merit and conduct has profoundly moved one individual, clearly pointing toward enlightenment, and thus his words carry wondrous insight.\" He then recited three of Zhang’s *Xijiangyue* lyrics:\n\nHeaven and Earth have just passed through negativity and prosperity,\nDawn and dusk must recognize the cycles of hardship and obscurity.\nLike the hub turning with the axle, or the tide following its source,\nThe marvel lies in the art of subtraction and addition.\n\nAttain the One, and all things are complete—\nNo need to divide north, south, east, or west.\nReduce again and again, guarding past merit with care,\nFor the treasure of life must not be trifled with lightly.\n\nWhose is the maiden of sixteen,\nAnd where is the lord of nine-three?\nThey call themselves Wood-fluid and Metal-essence,\nYet when Earth is met, the Three Natures form.\n\nWith the aid of Ding’s refining fire,\nHusband and wife at last unite in reverent union.\nThe River Chariot dares not pause even briefly,\nBut carries them to the summit of Kunlun’s peak.\n\nThe elixir is the wondrous treasure of the colored body,\nRefined, it transforms endlessly.\nIf one further investigates the true source of nature,\nThe wondrous function of non-arising is decisively realized.\n\nNo need to wait for future lives—\nBefore one’s eyes, the Buddha’s divine powers are attained.\nEver since the Dragon Girl achieved this work,\nWho since has been able to follow in her footsteps?\n\nAbbot Li, having also encountered the true and attained the Dao, left teachings that differ markedly from Ping Shu’s. Some say that Elder Li did not speak of the art of life, while Ping Shu did not speak of the school of nature. Yet nature and life are not two—this principle is perfectly clear. But it is difficult to express in words; only those of penetrating understanding may receive its transmission. Thus it is said: \"When someone comes seeking the Dao, you must transmit it to one of attainment.\" And again: \"It may be transmitted, but not imparted.\" Just as Yao transmitted the realm to Shun, and Shun to Yu, because Shun and Yu possessed mysterious virtue and sagely merit, so too is the transmission of the Dao. If it were said that the Dao could be transmitted to anyone, then the ancestral masters would not have left Mount Zhongnan, and all people would have attained accomplishment—why then would they have gone to such lengths in the eastern seas? After receiving the four true masters, the master then ranked his disciples and nephews in order: Dan Yang was his younger brother, Tan his nephew, and Chang Sheng and Chang Chun his sons. Later, when the four true masters attained the Dao, their progress varied in speed. Dan Yang took two and a half years, Chang Zhen five, Chang Sheng seven, and Chang Chun’s master eighteen or nineteen years, for his resolve and conduct penetrated Heaven and Earth, and only then did the sages grant it to him. Each was tested according to the depth of their accumulated merit and conduct, and thus their ranking and the speed of their attainment differed. Even the true masters were like this—how much more so for today’s learners, who do not accumulate merit and conduct yet wish to attain the Dao? There is no such principle. It is like a man wishing to buy goods worth a thousand gold pieces: he must first possess goods of equal value before he can obtain them. If he covets the goods but does not accumulate their price, he merely harbors deluded thoughts, and there is no principle by which he may attain them. The essential point of the Dao is nothing other than the accumulation of merit and virtue.\n\nWhen the ancestral master first arrived in Dengzhou, there was an official named Jie who was naturally inclined toward good deeds and always received him with great earnestness. Later, when Masters Ma and Tan passed through Dengzhou, Official Jie led a gathering to offer a vegetarian feast and requested to leave the household life. He thought that since the ancestral master had employed a thousand expedients to accept only two disciples—Ma and Tan—over two years, his own request would surely be welcomed. He pleaded repeatedly, but the master refused. On another day, he asked again, but the master still refused.\n\nOfficial Jie withdrew. The ancestral master addressed those present, saying: \"Consider two men who wish to build a great hall here. The first has already established the foundation and amassed abundant timber; though he has not yet sought craftsmen, craftsmen come to him of their own accord. Why? Because with materials prepared, the work can be accomplished. The second merely points to the ground where the foundation should be laid—yet the hollows remain unfilled, no labor has been expended, and when master builders see this, they turn away without a backward glance.\n\nIt is like a fertile field of one *mu*: when sown and tended in season, it yields grain by the *dan*. But a barren, meager field—no skilled farmer will work it, for it is but labor in vain, yielding nothing. From this, can one not see that without merit and practice as the foundation, how can the Dao be attained?\n\nIn the past, there was a certain Daoist Liu who ground grain in Guanzhong. He observed silence, begged for his meals as they came, and his resolve and conduct were most austere. Once, he went sixteen days without food yet dared not entertain a single stray thought, enduring this trial to its end. Later, after sixteen years, his master took pity on his bitter discipline, yet his nature remained unruly—any slight provocation would rouse him to fiery rage. When I resided at Yuqing Abbey, he came to request lodging. After returning to his hometown, he passed through twice in two years, and I gradually saw his demeanor worsen, his words grow erratic. Though he was nearly sixty, I later heard he had returned to lay life. There is no other reason for this: from the outset, he did not take merit and practice as his foundation, and so it was bound to end thus.\n\nThose who once begged for alms and sat in meditation did so because their minds had glimpsed awakening, though not yet with perfect unity. Thus they dwelled in stillness to nurture and investigate true emptiness. But those who beg and sit in meditation today are mostly young and without understanding, their minds hollow and void, often falling into delusion and falsehood. How lamentable!\n\nNow the gate of the teaching stands wide open, and every action is an act of merit and practice. With earnestness and humility, severing the distinctions of self and other, suffering for oneself to benefit others—this is the very nature of the Dao. Persevere without cease, and in time, awakening will come of itself.\n\nYet today, when people see another performing good deeds, they say, 'There is the heart of the Dao.' When they see unwholesome conduct, they say, 'There is no heart of the Dao.' If one reasons thus, can they truly be said to know the Dao? Let none among you doubt this.\n\nOnce, while traveling in Beishan, I sought lodging for the night at Tongxian Abbey in Zhenxian Camp, where I sat with the assembly. Li Zhishao recited an old lyric containing the line: *The celestial origin of jiazi has arrived.* When the song ended, I jested, saying: 'For us Daoists, the celestial origin of *jiazi* has already passed.' The others did not understand. I explained: 'This was something Master Changsheng often said. I once heard him say: *Cultivation must accord with the time—this is precisely the season of the celestial origin of jiazi, a time of great celebration. Once this time has passed, cultivation will become far more difficult.* At first, I did not fully believe it, for I had not yet understood deeply. But now, having entered the Dao for many years, I recognize the profound truth of timing.\n\nI have observed that in the early years of Master Changsheng’s leadership, those who cultivated would dwell in stillness and apply themselves, and before long, signs would arise in their minds—such cases were too numerous to count. But in his later years, none were seen to attain realization. Why? Because the time was no longer right.\"\n\nJust as one who sows seeds in the midwinter moon expends twice the usual labor yet reaps nothing, so too do all worldly affairs wax and wane with the times—who can defy this? My master often said that the Confucians’ discourse on the Dao is fully expounded in the *Analects* and *Mencius*. In my youth, I read these books and savored their flavor; later, when I entered the Dao, I grasped their principle.\n\nConfucius said to Yan Yuan: *\"When employed, act; when set aside, withdraw—only you and I possess this.\"* The sage did not favor Yanzi alone; the others simply could not fathom this principle. What is this principle? It is nothing other than *timing*. When one may advance, advance; when one may retreat, retreat; when one may abide long, abide long; when one may hasten, hasten. There is no absolute \"can\" or \"cannot\"—in movement and stillness, there is no self, only following the time. Thus, in movement and stillness, there is nothing that is not the Dao. Hence, Mencius praised Confucius, saying: *\"He was orderly in all things, the great synthesizer, the sage who acted according to the time.\"* Whether advancing or retreating, whether acting or non-acting, his Dao was one. Thus, Mencius said: *\"Yu, Ji, and Yan Yuan shared the same Dao; had their places been exchanged, they would have done the same.\"*\n\nIn my youth, I once asked my master: *\"The merits and virtues of Yao and Shun were towering, governing the world with reverent effort—this was acting. Xu You declined Yao’s abdication, having no desire for the world—this was non-acting. Why are both called sages?\"* My master replied: *\"Acting and non-acting are one and the same; in the Dao, they are identical. For the cultivator, wholly abandoning worldly affairs to focus the mind on inner work is non-acting; attending to circumstances and accumulating merit and conduct is acting. Focusing the mind on inner work is superior, but next to that, nothing surpasses accumulating merit and deeds—both emerge from the same Dao. Those who fail to understand this cannot grasp the great unity. Thus, each clings to one side, debating right and wrong, unaware that movement and stillness are mutually the substance and function of one another. Not only are movement and stillness one—yin and yang, day and night, life and death, the manifest and the hidden are all fundamentally the same. One who knows the Dao of life also knows death. One who fully comprehends the principle of the manifest also comprehends the hidden. What doubt remains?\"*\n\nWhen Zilu asked about serving ghosts and spirits, Confucius said: *\"If you cannot serve men, how can you serve ghosts?\"* When asked about death, he replied: *\"If you do not know life, how can you know death?\"* Zilu should have grasped this profound principle in the Master’s words, yet such understanding is reserved for the perceptive. This is why my master, whenever he encountered a perceptive person, would encourage and guide them, never lightly abandoning them. For instance, Master Danyang’s disciple Sun Penglai was keen and intelligent from childhood; as he grew, there was nothing he did not master, excelling even in literature and medicine. With such insight, attaining the Dao would not have been difficult. He often lived in seclusion, and my master deeply regretted this, wishing to keep him close, but Sun refused to comply.\n\nPerceptive people may indeed attain the Dao, yet their emotions are often stirred by external influences, making it difficult to maintain purity and stillness. As Du Zimei’s poem says: *\"In the dead of night, I rise and sit, assailed by ten thousand feelings.\"* Thus, one sees how the perceptive are prone to such afflictions. Generally, the perceptive are endowed by Heaven with spirit, and even in death, they remain close to the divine. Yet if their emotions and desires are not eradicated, they will inevitably drift and transmigrate. If, however, they employ their perceptive gifts to diligently practice the Dao, mastering human desires and attaining pure unity without interruption—like an infant or a newborn babe—they will reach the realm of true immortality. Human nature is fundamentally thus; all else is but emotion and desire.\n\nHence, the various masters debated human nature: some claimed it was evil, others that it was a mix of good and evil, while only Mencius asserted its goodness. This is why he stands below the sages yet above all other masters. Only the perceptive can understand and practice this teaching. Is human perceptiveness without cause? In truth, it arises from the accumulation of merit and conduct over many lives, which becomes one’s good fortune. Nurtured by this fortune, one’s nature naturally awakens, and thus Heaven endows one with perceptiveness. How could there be perceptiveness without cause?\n\nToday, the gate of the teaching stands wide open—this is precisely the time to accumulate merit and conduct, to act as the foundation for entering the Dao. Yet some hear but do not believe, believe but do not act, idling away their time, exploiting others, and few among them avoid falling into decline. Alas!\n\nMy master said: *\"Among learners, those who are widely informed and knowledgeable often overthink, weighing gains and losses heavily—this is why their faith wavers. Others, knowing nothing, neither seek advantage nor avoid harm, their minds single-mindedly devoted. Though they may appear foolish and dull, they draw near to the Dao. Generally, those overly concerned with gains and losses lack purity; without purity, there is no sincerity; without sincerity, how can one enter the Dao?\"*\n\nMy master also said: *\"Whenever I speak plainly to others, they take it as commonplace and do not strive earnestly. Many believe that only those who communicate with spirits or attain sagehood are truly on the Dao.\"* I recall someone once urging my master to display his abilities more, so as to gain the world’s trust and esteem. My master paid no heed; when pressed repeatedly, the advisor grew more insistent. My master laughed heartily and said: *\"I spent fifty years learning the word ‘sincerity’—I will not cast it aside in a single day.\"*\n\nThus, the perfected do not perform deeds to astonish the world. Like a worldly person who hoards wealth, even in haste or peril, they do not lightly part with it. Therefore, the perfected appear as if they have nothing, their fullness as emptiness; they do not reveal even the slightest hint, even feigning madness to blend with the world, fearing that others might recognize them. If others do recognize them and show reverence, it harms their own cultivation. Thus, when Chan Master Zhou resolved the fight between tigers, he lost his third fruit—all these are truths of sincerity.\n\nYet people invariably assume that only those who display wondrous spiritual powers are aligned with the Dao—unaware that such attainment must first arise from the accumulation of merit and conduct. When these have grown deep and substantial, the heart naturally becomes numinous, and external circumstances naturally respond, all of which is self-realized. If one harbors intent in seeking, it inevitably leads to falsity, and the harm to one’s nature and fortune is beyond measure.\n\n*Record of the Northern Journey of Master Qinghe, Scroll One – Concluded*\n*Record of the Northern Journey of Master Qinghe, Scroll Two*\nCompiled by Disciple Duan Zhijian\n\nOn the Mid-Autumn night, we sat in the open air at Qizhen Abbey. The conversation turned to the Sacred Spring of Fan Mountain, said to be the birthplace of the Yellow Emperor. Beside the spring stood a tree upon which the Emperor’s mother once spread her garments to dry. The tree then bent and twisted, its branches and leaves shading the spring, as if not by mere chance. The elders say that when the tree grew old, a new shoot sprouted beneath it. As it matured, its branches and form mirrored the original, and so it has continued for generations unknown.\n\nSomeone asked: *\"Given such marvels, why has there been no grand construction to honor and propagate them?\"*\nThe Master replied: *\"I once saw a small stele there. Upon reading it, I learned that a Tang dynasty magistrate had donated his own salary to erect it. After the Song dynasty came to power, this region fell under Khitan rule, and so no further efforts were made. For wherever there is grand flourishing, there must also be grand decay. Only the ordinary endures—this is the inherent principle of all things.*\n\nFrom the Emperor’s time to the present spans over thirty-six hundred years, through countless rises and falls of dynasties. Yet the sacred site remains, revered across a hundred generations—all because it has endured in its ordinariness. My master, well-read and deeply versed in principle, understood that the Emperor’s virtue was ever praised among the people. Yet most do not fathom such truths and dismiss them as mere fables, few being those who truly listen and believe.\n\nIt is said the Emperor was not exiled but descended of his own accord, for when Heaven deliberated great deeds, it was deemed that nothing more could be accomplished above, and so he wished to act upon the earth below. In his first life as a commoner, he did all within his power to benefit the world. In his second life as an official, his works brought relief to the multitudes. In his third life as Emperor, he bequeathed enduring benefits to ten thousand generations. Thus do we know that celestial beings must bestow merit upon the world, ensuring that the people draw from it without exhaustion, before they may ascend once more and dwell in their rightful place above.\n\nAbbot Zhang of the Abbey asked: *\"It is said that the Emperor’s ancestors spanned five eras, each marked by sagely virtue, and that the people lived for ten thousand years. Is this credible?\"*\nThe Master replied: *\"Without written records to verify, it may seem fantastical. Yet by principle, it is entirely plausible. When humans first receive the qi of the Dao to come into being, they necessarily follow its waxing and waning. At the dawn of heaven and earth, when the qi of the Dao was pure and unadulterated, those born were like infants in nature, all attuned to its essence—how could their lifespans have been limited to ten thousand years? As the qi of the Dao gradually receded, the earth produced lingzhi mushrooms, and those who ate them still lived for a thousand years. When the qi of the Dao further dispersed, the hundred grains arose. People selected the finest to eat, savoring their flavors, and thus desires were born—no wonder their lifespans fell short of a hundred. By principle, this cannot be called a falsehood.\"*\n\nIn my youth, I read the Buddhist *Lotus Sutra*, which spoke of the sun’s size, the moon’s size, the nine heavens, the nine earthly layers, each with their respective heights and depths. At first, I dismissed it as absurd. Later, upon entering the Dao, I grasped its meaning. The nine heavens, for instance, are the realm of emptiness. Since emptiness is paired with fullness, the nine earthly layers follow as a matter of course. Just as the earth yields gold, silver, copper, and iron, what we see as metals are merely the qi of the Five Phases concentrated within, manifesting externally as form and substance—moving from non-being into being. Though they may seem hard and enduring, in time they must return to their origin.\n\nOnce, a guest remarked on the fashion of adorning garments with gold, calculating that the daily cost amounted to no less than several hundred *qian*. Who would have thought that even solid gold could decay? From this, I understood that most people remain ignorant of the Way of Heaven. The Way of Heaven inevitably returns—not by deliberate intent, but by its own nature. This is principle. Gold emerges from the earth, yet it never sought to be used by the world. It is humans who, through cunning, extract it without end, thereby wounding the primordial qi. Though its form may decay, its qi returns to its origin. Were it otherwise, the Way of generation would cease.\n\nThis principle of generation applies not only to metal, water, fire, earth, and wood, but to all things. Once, while traveling with my master north of Yin Mountain, we came upon a great forest in the desert. Though untouched by axes, the trees—regardless of size—had all withered. Their root-qi had simply waned, leaving no choice but to decay. Yet beneath them, new shoots had already sprouted—this is the Way of generation. From this, we see that flourishing and decay, life and death, are all natural. Human fortunes—wealth and poverty, honor and disgrace, longevity and early death—are likewise determined by fate. Only when people refuse to accept their lot do they exhaust their minds and bodies in ceaseless striving. Yet in the end, they cannot add even a fraction to their allotted portion. If their intentions stray from rectitude and accumulate into transgressions, the harm they incur is beyond imagination—not only do they gain nothing, but they bring ruin upon themselves. Thus it is said: *\"The Dao is without intent.\"*\n\nAs the world declines and the people fail to comprehend this principle, Heaven sends forth great sages and worthies to save them. Through teachings and personal example, they illuminate the Three Principles, guiding all to restore their original nature. This is the very purpose of the ancestral masters’ teachings.\n\nThe Master said: *\"When people suffer deception, humiliation, or even murder without cause, it is always in repayment of past debts. Only the enlightened, who understand principle, dare not deceive even a single thought, nor slight even a single thing.\"*\n\nA single word or deed must be weighed with utmost care, lest one wrong any being—better that others wrong oneself than that one wrong another. To deceive others is to deceive oneself; to harm others is to harm oneself, like turning a blade upon one’s own body.\n\nOnce, as the Master sat with his disciples discussing how worldly people often exploit those below to curry favor with those above, seeking only their own security, he said: *\"How deluded they are! To take from the many yet secure their trust is to find true security without seeking it. But if one seeks only personal safety while neglecting the many, one only invites peril—such is the failure to grasp the Way of loss and gain.\"* Thus it is said: *\"What is diminished may yet increase; what is increased may yet diminish.\"* This is not a truth the common world can comprehend.\n\nOn the seventeenth night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, the assembly of Qizhen Abbey sat beneath the open sky. The sculptor Wang Cai made obeisance and entreated the Master to instruct him in the method of crafting Daoist images. The Master replied: *\"Of all images, none is harder to fashion than that of the Daoist adept. Not only is the sculpting difficult, but even the discourse upon it is arduous. One must first master the rituals and protocols of the teachings, as well as the principles of iconographic representation, before one can speak of the Daoist image.*\n\n*The Great Dao of emptiness and quiescence cannot be seen or heard. Though sound and form lie before us, it is not that we truly do not see or hear—rather, we do not exhaust our perception in external things, for within, something is preserved. To claim we truly do not see or hear would reduce us to dead matter. Yet if nothing is preserved within and all perception is given over to externals, we are merely led by things. The challenge of the Daoist image lies in revealing outward sight and hearing while conveying the intent of inner contemplation—this is why it is so difficult.*\n\n*Even the most wealthy and noble of worldly figures have images that are easily captured. The rich and powerful, for instance, are often depicted with flushed complexions, heavy flesh, and full jowls, verging on the gross and turbid. But the Daoist image must retain its ethereal refinement and transcendent bearing, exuding the aura of a great noble—visible in the brows and eyes, in the celestial expanse of the forehead, and in the moonlit angles of the temples. The back should resemble a vessel of ten thousand *hu*, symbolizing profound depth and gravity. Only by grasping these essentials can one approximate the true likeness.*\n\n*Yet even then, one must convey the intent without allowing sharp edges to protrude—this is what makes it even harder. The riches and honors of the world, even those of emperors, can still be sought through conventional methods. But the Daoist image must be sought beyond technique. In external appearance, one may exhaust all subtleties, but when it comes to the inner aspect, technique alone cannot suffice. Yet what is within must manifest without, becoming visible in one’s conduct. Conduct is the trace; the principle behind conduct is the truth. By examining the trace, the truth may be known—thus inner and outer become one.*\n\n*The Daoist adept values discretion and concealment, so that others may never truly see them. As Liezi lived in the gardens of Zheng for forty years, yet no one recognized him. The ancestral masters and their successive perfected disciples, having opened the gate of the teachings, revealed hidden mysteries and expounded profound wonders in every place and time.*\n\n*The Master once said: 'The ancients attained enlightenment but lacked the encounter; the people of today have the encounter but lack enlightenment. In ancient times, many of noble aspiration and lofty conduct, embracing simplicity and preserving truth, never met a perfected one to guide them and thus spent their lives in obscurity. Today, though people are fortunate to encounter perfected ones who widely open the gate of the teachings, some still fail to awaken—how lamentable!'*\n\n*An ancient saying goes: 'Once in a thousand years a sage appears; once in five hundred years a worthy emerges.' This speaks to the rarity of their coming. Yet who can say that the ancestral masters and their successive perfected disciples did not all appear in this world? Though the perfected masters of today may not be visible, their transmitted teachings remain intact. People dismiss them as crude or simplistic, paying them no heed, unaware that their words are plain yet their meaning profound.*\n\n*Scholars may judge these teachings by the standards of literary composition and find them wanting in form. But the perfected ones aim to clarify the Dao and care little for the rules of writing. Though the Venerable Master of Longevity did not study books, his compositions flowed naturally from his heart and mind—such as his one hundred and twenty *Ruizhegu* poems and sixty *Feng Rusong* verses, all composed extemporaneously. His commentaries on the Three Teachings were written without pause, their words spare but their principles abundant. Those who understand recognize them as the very model of immortals’ discourse. Though he did not study literature, he grasped its essence—for principle is the Dao itself.*\n\n*In all things, whether the literary arts of scholars or the crafts of artisans, the subtleties emerge from the Dao. Yet people go about their days without realizing it. All things arise from emptiness. Pointing to the temple hall, the Master said: 'Even this hall, with its sculptures and paintings, is but a phantasm born of human nature; human nature itself is a phantasm born of the Dao. Is not its wondrous function the Dao itself? Though heaven and earth are vast and the myriad things are many, they too arise from emptiness.'*\n\n*The Supreme Ultimate generates the Two Modes; the Two Modes generate the Four Images; the Four Images generate the Eight Trigrams. Through mutual interaction and transformation, their changes are inexhaustible. The classic says: 'The Dao generates the One; the One generates the Two; the One generates the Three; the Three generate the myriad things.' It also says: 'Though the things of the world flourish, each returns to its root. Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called the restoration of life.' This is the ultimate subtlety of the Dao.*\n\n*Born of the Dao, if one can return to the Dao, one does not lose one’s original nature. The sages and worthies have left behind a thousand scriptures and ten thousand treatises—yet they never spoke of soaring transformations or ascending to heaven in broad daylight. Their sole aim was that people not lose their original nature. Life and death, coming and going, are clearly determined by oneself. If one cannot conduct oneself properly in the world, one loses the Way. A single loss leads to endless deviations, and one may wander through the six paths of rebirth and the four modes of existence.*\n\n*After attaining the Dao, Master Hao of the Great Antiquity once asked his disciples: 'Which teaching is most essential to the Dao?' One replied: 'That of non-coming and non-going.' The Master smiled and said: 'This is but the teaching itself—coming and going must be clearly understood!'*\n\nWhen the Master resided in Jiaoxi, he once posed this question to his assembly, and one from the mountain before him responded with what his own heart had realized. Later, in the desert, he again asked this of the assembly. I replied: \"Respond to thoughts as they arise, moment by moment, with no obstruction—this has its own root and source.\" The Master approved of this.\n\nWho among men is without thought? The key is to discern whether thoughts are upright or perverse; what must be discarded are the perverse ones. Whatever harms essence, spirit, or qi is perverse. Many learners, not understanding this, cling to the idea that thoughts must be eradicated entirely. Yet if one follows principle in action, accumulating merit and cultivating conduct through upright thoughts, would one then eradicate these as well? To do so would reduce one to a dead thing—how could this accord with the Dao?\n\nIt is like a man sitting in a bare room, daring not to engage with anything, daring not to stir a single thought, hoping to preserve and await the Dao. But does he know whether the Dao can truly be preserved and awaited—or not? I would take heaven and earth as my bare room, roaming freely within them, engaging with things in their midst, with ample room to spare, and never feel it hinders the Dao.\n\nThere is a saying:\n*Who is without thought? Who is without life?*\n*If truly without life, then nothing is not alive.*\n\nAnother verse:\n*Clouds drift away, clouds drift in—the sky remains still.*\n*Flowers bloom, flowers fade—the tree stays at ease.*\n\nPointing to the moon, he said: \"This thing does nothing, yet beneath the azure heavens, floating clouds may obscure it. When they part, its empty brightness penetrates all, illuminating everything—all can see it. Yet people do not realize that each person possesses this moon of the heart. Only when floating clouds obscure it does its light fade. All selfish desires and perverse thoughts are these floating clouds. If one can constantly prevent perverse thoughts from arising, the moon of the heart will shine as brightly as the moon in the sky, enduring with heaven and earth, never again obscured.\"\n\nThe Master said: \"In former times, those who cultivated the Way examined every thought in every dust-mote and instant. If they detected a single evil thought, they would confess it to others, bringing upon themselves shame and humiliation, hoping it would never again arise in their hearts. Today’s learners are the opposite: if they perform even a minor good deed, they boast and flaunt it, fearing others will not know. Yet they conceal and excuse a thousand evils, fearing others will discover them. How can they ever truly do good?\"\n\nWhen the Master was at leisure, his disciples sat beside him. He invited them to sit, and they exchanged bows for a long time without settling. The Master said: \"In ritual propriety, what matters most is sincerity and naturalness. If one harbors no competitive intent yet happens to be in a superior position, what harm is there? In private, one need not defer excessively—too much deference borders on pretense. Yet ritual is founded on reverence; if not tempered by righteousness, it cannot be practiced. To conduct oneself with reverence and act with righteousness—this is the mark of a noble person. Reverence is constancy; righteousness is adaptation. To know constancy but not adaptation is to cling to one extreme. Clinging to one extreme is to lack understanding.\n\nThe four seasons of heaven—warmth, chill, cold, heat—wind, rain, thunder, and lightning—are all transformations. They change in response to stimuli, even spirits and gods cannot predict them. Human affairs are no different. Not only in ritual, but in every word and deed, one must not act rashly. Respond to situations as they arise, ensuring each action is fitting. Do not dismiss this as a trivial matter and fail to apply your heart—this is where the Dao is found.\n\nIn the past, when the Master of Danyang first established the teachings, he took rejecting extravagance and embracing frugality—going against worldly ways—as the great constant. Whatever the world desired, he would not pursue. Only because people are endlessly consumed by craving, becoming deluded and losing their true nature, unable to recover it, did he set the precept: no more than three companions on the Way, no more than three rooms in a thatched hut. Even when building an ancestral hall, he limited it to three rooms. The site was quite elevated and open, and his disciples requested to ascend and look out, but he would not permit it. He said: 'I have not exerted effort here—why would I indulge in climbing and gazing, which are worldly desires? Those who cultivate the real do not do such things.'\n\nThe scripture says:\n*As in spring, one ascends a terrace.*\nIt speaks of the heart’s delight. Looking down at the flourishing spring scenery, the mind is at ease. When the mind is at ease, emotions arise. When scenery and emotion meet, one drifts into attachment, gradually losing the way back. Moreover, wandering in scenic places truly depletes one’s good fortune.\n\nI recall when the Master first entered the Changchun Palace and ascended the Baoxuan Hall, he saw the ornate beams and rafters, the fresh furnishings, and stood gazing for a long time before departing. The assembly invited him to sit, but he refused. There was no other reason—he, too, feared it would deplete his good fortune.\"\n\nAt that time, someone, knowing it was improper, deliberately urged me to sit, and I complied. There are matters one cannot avoid—though I initially had no intention of doing so, others, with clever persuasion, induced me to act. If I had merely gone along, what harm would there have been? After all, I had no prior intent. Yet if one harbors hidden motives while outwardly refusing to comply, how can one escape fault?\n\nThe Master said: When the Patriarch resided on Kunjian Mountain, my master Changchun had followed him for three years, at the age of twenty-three. The Patriarch, recognizing Master Danyang’s vast merit and conduct from past lives, often discussed profound mysteries with him. But since Changchun’s merit had not yet reached that level, he was made to perform mundane labor without a moment’s rest. One day, the Patriarch closed the door to discuss breath-regulation methods with Danyang. My master eavesdropped outside, and after a while, pushed the door open and entered, halting their discussion.\n\nMy master reflected inwardly: if breath-regulation is so wondrous, then the labor I perform is precisely its opposite. From then on, whenever he had spare time, he diligently practiced what he had overheard. Later, when the Patriarch was about to depart, over those three years, he subjected the four disciples to rigorous training—one day’s work equaled what would have taken a hundred or a thousand days before. Their actions were reversed, their conduct disordered, every movement and word met with scolding and reproach.\n\nMy master thought to himself: Since following the Patriarch, I have not understood what the Dao truly is. Everything he has taught me seems irrelevant to the matter at hand. I wished to ask him, but feared the Patriarch’s severity. I considered going along with his instructions, yet my longing for the Dao was too urgent. My mind could not settle, and I grew increasingly frustrated. One day, seizing an opportunity, I asked him.\n\nThe Patriarch replied: It lies within your nature.\nHe said nothing more, and my master dared not ask again.\n\nLater, just before the Patriarch’s departure, during the twelfth lunar month, the four disciples were instructed to procure money and buy large quantities of firewood and charcoal, which were then burned in the small chamber where he slept. The room was so cramped that Danyang and Changzhen were made to stand inside, unable to endure the heat, while Changsheng and Changchun stood outside, unable to bear the cold. Those inside dared not step out, and those outside dared not enter. This continued for a long time, until Master Changsheng, unable to endure the suffering, fled.\n\nOn the fourth day of the first lunar month, as the Patriarch was about to ascend, the three remaining disciples stood beneath the trees. The Patriarch said: Danyang has attained the Dao, Changzhen has understood it, and I have no concerns about them. But Changsheng and Changchun have not yet done so. Changchun’s learning shall henceforth be guided entirely by Danyang’s command, and Changzhen shall oversee Changsheng.\n\nThen, turning to Changchun, he said: You bear a great fault that must be eradicated. You once thought that everything I taught you was irrelevant. You did not realize that the very irrelevance is the Dao.\n\nMy master later recounted these words. At first, I found them tasteless, but upon reflection, they proved to be the highest truth. All worldly affairs are entangled in the realm of attachment; only in their absence lies the Dao. Yet most people cannot escape this realm of attachment and thus often fall into evil. For in the world, good and evil are evenly matched—since there is one yin and one yang, this cannot be otherwise. It depends entirely on what one chooses.\n\nIf one consistently practices goodness, evil gradually recedes, and one may reach a state of pure goodness where evil thoughts no longer arise. But if one indulges in evil without repentance, evil becomes habitual, and even good thoughts cannot take root.\n\nAfter the ritual at Qizhen Abbey concluded, the Master sat in silent meditation for a long time. The assembly rose and bowed, entreating him to teach. The Master said: Do not think I am withholding anything. I do not speak because there is no one to receive it. To speak without being heard, or to be heard without being practiced, is of no benefit to either side—why should I speak?\n\nI recall when I was in Binzhou, I was suddenly stricken with wind-illness. I thought to myself: In this life, I have been fortunate to meet true masters, and all the profound and subtle teachings I have received were transmitted orally, heart to heart. I vowed to pass them on to later generations. If I were to perish from this illness, it would fail to fulfill the intent of the masters’ transmission. Moreover, today I have inherited the leadership of the teaching—how could I conceal anything?\n\nSince the time of the Patriarch, the teachings have flourished as they have. The reason people from all directions trust me is that they believe I have personally served the Perfected and must have received their transmission. How could I not wish to speak of the Perfected’s Dao?\n\nI remember when I followed my master on the northern journey from Weizhou during a time of hardship. Many devotees accompanied us for over half a month, hoping to hear a single word, but they could not. One day, Elder Xiao, through Master Da, begged my master to respond to the assembly’s wishes. My master said: Have I ever failed to respond? I am like a bell—wherever it is struck, it answers. If struck with great force, its sound can fill heaven and earth without difficulty. This I heard with my own ears.\n\nI was born in the ninth year of the Dading era, and the Patriarch ascended in the tenth year, so I did not have the chance to serve him directly. But I served all the subsequent masters. Master Taigu personally expounded the *Book of Changes* to me—teachings unheard of in the world. Master Yuyang held my hand and discoursed on the wonders of the Dao. The instructions from Master Changchun are too numerous to recount.\n\nNow, at nearly seventy years of age, my time of return approaches—how could I not wish to pass on what I have received? All my words are grounded in truth, but people often prefer the strange and marvelous, so those who hear them do not take them to heart.\n\nChen Xiuyu was utterly convinced by my master. He once told others: The reason I am so devoted to Qiu Changchun is simply because of his truthfulness. When we discussed the teachings, he said: Daoism and Buddhism employ expedient means, but Confucianism does not. Only someone deeply versed in principle could make such a statement. For the teachings of Daoism and Buddhism use skillful means to transform people, designed for those of middling or lesser capacity—this is the expedient of the sages.\n\nConfucius once said: \"Those above the median may be spoken to of higher things, while those below the median cannot.\" Thus, the sages condescend to employ expedient means, gently guiding them to make entry easy—yet the ultimate goodness is one and the same. Does the heart of the sage differ from others? All aim for goodness alone.\n\nNow, I speak truthfully to all of you. What you hear is not my private word, but the teaching of the Perfected. When people first set their minds on learning the Dao and embracing goodness, none fail to advance with vigor. Yet before long, they grow lax, for they harbor vain desires and, seeing no verification, fall into doubt they cannot resolve—thus abandoning the Way mid-course.\n\nThe sages established their teachings for all under heaven and for posterity, wishing only that people cast off delusion and return to their nature, preventing the passions and desires from disturbing the center, so that the heart may rest in its ordinary state—this is the foundation of entering the Dao. Do the sages alone lack passions? They merely keep their hearts unmoved. Just as heaven has its four seasons, with cold and heat in alternation, thunder, wind, and rain transforming all before them, yet the true substance of the Great Void never stirs. When the learner investigates and attains this, they reach the state of ordinariness. Hence the saying: \"Ordinariness is the Dao.\"\n\nFirst preserve this ordinariness. The accumulation of conduct and merit depends entirely on oneself—this lies within one’s power. The manifestation of the Dao, the grasp of sages and worthies, lies with Heaven. One must fulfill what lies within one’s power and leave what lies with Heaven. When merit and conduct are complete, the Dao is naturally attained. To seek it with intent is delusion.\n\nOnce, when traveling with my master to Xianzhou, a magistrate never left his side for a single day. Seizing an opportunity, he asked: \"I have devoted myself to the Dao in seclusion for fifteen years. People call me pure and tranquil, yet I know myself that I have not attained it.\" My master smiled but did not answer. After a long while, he said: \"Purity and tranquility are not one. There is inner and outer, non-action and action. What you practice is outer—it is action. To have one son and one daughter is the common course of the world. Even what you do is not easily achieved, yet it is not true purity and tranquility. Non-action with self-attainment—this is true purity and tranquility, what the sages and worthies attain.\"\n\nSome learners today engage in visualization and breath regulation as their practice. Though good, they never see success. It is like forcing flowers to bloom in winter beneath a shelter—though marvelous, they never bear fruit. Only non-action and purity are the ultimate attainment, verified by the absence of leakage. After three years without leakage, the lower elixir forms. After six years, the middle elixir forms—matters already beyond full description. After nine years, the upper elixir forms, ascending into the Mud Pill Palace. The Three Palaces rise and descend, transformations endless. Even a thousand or ten thousand emanation bodies emerge from this. How can one achieve this? By ensuring the heart-ground is ordinary.\n\nFor when the heart is ordinary, the spirit is settled; when the spirit is settled, essence congeals; when essence congeals, qi harmonizes. This manifests in the face and radiates through the four limbs—all naturally. The foundation is the heart-ground’s ordinariness. What lies within one’s power must be fully realized; what depends on Heaven cannot be forced. Only when merit and conduct are complete will there be self-attainment.\n\nMaster Changchun often said that among today’s teaching lineage, those who advance in the Dao with utmost sincerity are all bound by karmic encounters from past lives—true masters like Zhengyang and Chunyang have forged deep connections. If people today understand this principle and ceaselessly accumulate virtue, their advancement cannot be measured. It is like the officials of the court, each ranked in order. Their demotion or promotion is determined by merit and fault. As cultivators, they stand a grade above ordinary people. Like officials of the nine ranks, if they have merit without fault, their advancement is unceasing, and the highest rank may be expected. Yet learners, ignorant of this, neglect solid merit and seek only the honor of the highest rank. How could this be possible?\n\nObserve the Perfected who attained the Dao—their levels differ, all according to the depth of their accumulated merit and conduct. Master Danyang attained the Dao in two and a half years, Changzhen in five, Changsheng in seven. Master Changchun spent nearly twenty years at Panxi and Longmen, his will and qi penetrating heaven and earth, his actions resonating with sages and worthies. The Dao acknowledged him, yet later, his progress vanished without trace. His resolve grew only firmer, yet after attaining it, it was soon taken away—because his merit and conduct were not yet complete. If even the Perfected face this, how much more so others? Learners should only advance in merit and conduct, without seeking verification or harboring doubt. When practice is complete, awakening will come naturally.\n\nThose with exceptional natural intelligence far surpassing the ordinary are not the result of a single lifetime. Their accumulation must have been gradual. At three, I remembered all I saw and heard, never forgetting. At five, I entered school and, within three winter months, could recite the *Classic of Filial Piety* and the *Analects*. Even if I memorized over a thousand words a day, I still had energy to spare. My grandfather was versed in the study of yin and yang. When I sought to learn it, he refused, saying: \"You must first memorize the sixty-year cycle in a single day.\" I pleaded insistently, and after noon, he taught me. By sunset, I could recite it fluently.\n\nMy family was a great clan of Cangzhou. During the Song, they took office in Donglai and settled there. One mother bore nine sons, all of whom studied and passed the imperial examinations, seven attaining the rank of prefect—monuments still stand today. By the Dading era, the family traditions had not yet declined. When a son was born, at three he was already included in the ancestral rites.\n\nAt the age of five, during the Cold Food Festival that year, nearly a hundred of us paid respects at the ancestral graves. The rites concluded before sunrise, and after dispersing, all indulged in feasting, merriment, and play, each following their own desires.\n\nI alone felt a stirring within. Privately, I pondered: our ancestors stretch into the distant past, yet where have they gone? Mortals face death, yet where do they return? My heart grew desolate. Seated beneath a great mulberry tree, I gazed upward and downward, contemplating how heaven and earth endure, how the myriad things arise. Above the heavens and below the earth—what covers and sustains them? What upholds and maintains all? My thoughts probed so deeply that they dissolved into thoughtlessness, and I forgot the vastness of heaven and earth, the multitude of things. All I perceived was a boundless expanse of misty qi, connecting above and below like the shell of an egg, dark and indistinct. Unaware, my heart and form seemed to vanish.\n\nWhen my family found me, they called me back—only then did I realize the day had already grown late. At first, I did not understand what had transpired, but later, upon entering the Dao and encountering a true teacher, I awakened to the wonder of this forgotten state of mind.\n\nAt seven, I met the Great Master Wang of Guanzhong, and his words resonated deeply with me. At fourteen, I encountered Master Danyang and sought to leave the household, but my father sternly forbade it. By nineteen, I was once more thrust into worldly life and confined at home. I would secretly pray beneath the Northern Star, performing a thousand prostrations each time.\n\nOne day, a military officer named Master Liu and his guests discussed the Dao outside the central gate. I knelt in rapt attention, the gravel pressing into my knees without my notice. Later, I fled, only to be forced back—this happened three times before I finally escaped the secular world.\n\nThough I once dwelled in the world, I never truly understood its ways.\n\nAt first, I resided in a hut west of Changyi County. Often, I would sit alone beneath a peach tree, and sometimes, lost in meditation, I would remain unaware until past midnight, oblivious to the break of dawn.\n\nOne night, during the fourth watch, a figure suddenly appeared—his bearing that of an immortal, his spirit untouched by the mundane world, his presence radiant with golden light and jade-like luster. At first sight, I composed my heart and remained unmoved, knowing him to be a True Person of Lifelong Cultivation. He approached and swung a blade to sever my head, yet my heart did not waver. Pleased, he restored it. Upon awakening, I realized with clarity that the master had transformed my worldly visage.\n\nTen days later, he returned and cut open my chest to remove my heart, and I understood he had taken away my worldly mind. Another ten days passed, and he arrived again, bearing a plate of scorching oil, which he offered to me. I consumed it all, feeling so overfull I nearly died, whereupon he split open my abdomen and cleared it entirely. This was because my nature had long been prideful—pride invites harm and setbacks, so he removed what would bring me ruin.\n\nAlas! Sincerity moves the divine; this is no empty truth. If one wholeheartedly practices the Dao, the distance between oneself and the sages is not far. I had never spoken of this to anyone, but now I reveal it fully to all. Let none dismiss these words as mere emptiness and fail to act upon them.\n\nOne night at Kaiyuan Abbey in Jianzhou, as the assembly discussed the rise and fall of human affairs, the master said: *\"To observe the Dao of Heaven and grasp its workings is to comprehend all.\"* Yet people fail to examine the subtleties of Heaven’s Dao—how then can they grasp and enact it?\n\nThe Dao of Heaven is profoundly mysterious. Consider but a few examples: though we say a day consists of one hundred *ke*, this is merely a general statement, for in truth, the count never quite reaches a hundred. Again, the ten Celestial Stems pair with the twelve Earthly Branches, their interplay generating endless transformations. Were a day truly a full hundred *ke* with stems and branches in perfect alignment, all would be fixed and unchanging. Precisely because of its capacity for change, the myriad beings arise ceaselessly without exhaustion.\n\nEvery single thing, every plant, though formed by the transformation of a single *qi*, experiences growth and decline, all tied to the flow of time. Take the five grains and the hundred grasses—countless in variety—when one species aligns with the season’s favor, its vitality surpasses all others. Such is the work of time. Thus it is said: *\"The ten thousand transformations emerge in accord with the hour.\"*\n\nIf even insentient things follow this principle, how much more so for humans, who partake of Heaven and Earth’s spirit? Just as the patterns of things have their flourishing and decay, so too do human affairs rise and fall. From the state down to every household, none are exempt. Consider the teachings from the West, which have entered China for over a thousand years—without the right time, how could this have come to pass? Yet what arises with the times must also fade with them. Though the rise and fall of all things depend on Heaven, Heaven’s true constancy never alters in the slightest. Why? Because it is without intent.\n\nIf one fails to comprehend this principle, joy and sorrow arise without reason, and one is swept along by external things, losing one’s true nature and unable to recover it. Thus the enlightened person remains without intent, allowing the ten thousand changes to unfold before them without disturbance, for they know that their nature originally issues from Heaven and shares the same body with it. Therefore, all their actions follow the pattern of Heaven. Only when a student of the Dao reaches this point may they begin to enter the Way.\n\nAt Chuanzhou Jade Void Abbey, the Daoist community and faithful devotees served their master with tireless diligence, reluctant to depart even as night deepened. The master said: *\"The Elder of Everlasting Spring’s poem declares:\nWhite hair and aged face, yet immortality remains unfinished,\nRoaming mountains, drinking from streams—lingering still.\nNot that I disdain the many offices of Heaven,\nBut I fear the worldly entanglements of the human realm.\"*\n\nWorldly entanglements run deep and obstruct the Dao in countless ways. Human sentiments prize splendor, which runs counter to the Way. This earnest attachment and lingering affection are but manifestations of love—where there is love, there is also aversion, giving rise to joy, anger, sorrow, and delight. All are but emotions. If one cannot transcend emotion, how can one enter the Dao?\n\nThe love between parent and child may be called profound, yet even this does not burden the enlightened. As *Liezi* records of Dongmen Wu: when his son died, he felt no grief. Asked why, he replied, *\"Formerly, I lived as one without a son; now that he has died, it is no different. Only when one is without attachment can there be perfect kinship.\"* To regard all elders in the world as one’s own elders, all children as one’s own children, all things as belonging to oneself, and to view all with equal benevolence—is this not perfect kinship? Thus *Zhuangzi* says: *\"Supreme benevolence is without attachment.\"* If one is partial to those one loves, then there are those one does not love; if one cherishes what one favors, then there is what one does not favor. Such are the sentiments of the common world. The follower of the Dao must reverse this.\n\nWhatever the world loves, one should not love excessively; whatever the world hates, one should not hate excessively. Though the emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and delight may arise, they should be expressed in moderation, without harming one’s inner harmony. Thus the mind attains its natural equilibrium, and in equilibrium, the mind is perfected. As it is said: *\"Buddha-nature is originally without awakening; sentient beings are fundamentally not deluded. The ordinary use of the mind—this alone is bodhi.\"*\n\nThe Dao is fundamentally non-action; it is simply the perfection of the mind. Cultivating the mind to attain equilibrium allows the Dao to arise spontaneously. It is like tending a field: removing tiles and stones, clearing brambles, and eliminating what harms the sprouts; then, following the seasons and proper methods, sowing the seeds—without seeking the sprouts, they grow of themselves. Thus it is said: *\"The Dao is fundamentally non-action; it is simply the perfection of the mind.\"*\n\nIt is also said: *\"Perfection of the mind is the one method by which the ten thousand practices are complete.\"* Have you not seen how the true masters, though receiving direct transmission from the patriarchs, still undergo a thousand refinements and a hundred trials to discipline their minds? This is because, though their nature issues from the Dao, once embodied in form, it becomes burdened by emotions and desires. For form is inherited from one’s parents, constituted by the qi of yin and yang, and thus subject to movement and stillness—this is its principle.\n\nEven if a single good thought arises, it may be driven by the form and qi, preventing its fulfillment. Therefore, those of resolve know that the mind’s nature originally issues from the Dao, and they do not allow form and qi to usurp their will. With time, they overcome these obstacles, and both qi and form are transformed, merging seamlessly back into their original nature. All this is achieved through the equilibrium of the mind. When the mind is balanced, the spirit is settled; when the spirit is settled, the qi is attuned, and the Dao arises of itself. Thus it is said: *\"When form and spirit are both refined, they unite with the true Dao.\"*\n\nIf one does not shed the burdens of emotion to balance the mind, one merely wears out the body in vain, and none can enter the Dao. Those of superior endowment are born with knowledge and are not burdened by emotions; those of lesser endowment are dull and fail to grasp emotion; emotion resides only in the middling person—now present, now absent, capable of rising or falling. Through good habits, one ascends; through bad habits, one descends. The difference between good and evil is as vast as cloud and mud.\n\nConfucius said: *\"By nature, people are similar; by habit, they grow apart.\"* Therefore, one cannot afford to be without learning. I say that the ten scriptures and ten thousand methods are designed for the middling person. Teaching is to instruct what one does not yet know; learning is to awaken to what one has not yet realized. Once one knows what was unknown and awakens to what was unrealized, one must then put it into practice. When practice reaches its culmination, the mind and the method become one, and even the method may be discarded.\n\nThe method is like medicine: once the illness is cured, one need not take medicine further. Learning what was unrealized is wisdom and merit; propagating the teachings and benefiting beings is practice. Accumulating merit and practice forms the foundation of the Dao. Only by abandoning learning and relinquishing methods can one enter the Dao. Thus it is said: *\"To abandon learning is to be without care.\"* Without care, one perceives true emptiness, and without words, the Dao moves of itself. Like the Way of Heaven, which operates without effort, the four seasons proceed and the hundred things grow—what action is needed?\n\nAt the Yizhou Chaoyuan Abbey, the assembly gathered for evening discourse, speaking of the variations and changes in the teachings and disciplines of the Daoist gate. The Master said: *\"The Book of Changes* states: ‘The meaning of adapting to the times is truly great.’ This means that in human activity and stillness, one must always follow what is appropriate to the time. If not, there is nothing that does not lose its proper measure.\n\nMaster Danyang taught with non-action as the foundation, while Master Changsheng the True Man blended non-action and action equally. By the time of Master Changchun, action accounted for nine-tenths, and though non-action remained as one-tenth, it was preserved yet unused. The Dao is the same, but the times differ.\n\nFor instance, Master Danyang’s *Ten Exhortations* states: ‘A thatched hut should not exceed three bays.’ In today’s age, this may no longer be feasible; if one rigidly adheres to it, no benefit will be seen. It is like planting millet in winter—though one may expend double the effort, it will never come to fruition. The teachings of today, though largely emphasizing action, do not entirely reject non-action; it is simply that when the time is not right, it is preserved yet unused.\n\nMoreover, this is the tenth month—no one would plant millet now, for all know it cannot grow. Yet when spring comes, it may be planted; how could one not understand this principle? When I first studied the Dao, I awakened to the illusory nature of all things, reducing and refining until reaching non-action. Later, receiving the true instructions of my masters and delving into the principles of creation and transformation, I came to know the greatness of timely application.\n\nI recall Master Yuyang taking my hand and saying: ‘Seven golden lotuses bear fruit.’ Today, ten thousand jade lotuses bloom—yet they are all wild flowers. Thus, while the root of the Dao is natural, one must first practice action to accumulate merit and deeds, advancing ceaselessly. When external works are complete, attainment comes of itself without seeking.\n\nIt is said: ‘The radiant elixir is completed in a single day.’ Yet if disciples cling to these words, believing there is truly a principle by which it can be achieved in a day, they will wait in vain. What is meant is that when merit and practice reach their culmination, Heaven bestows the Dao, and sudden awakening arises in the heart—hence ‘completed in a day.’ If there were truly a principle by which one could attain the Dao in a day without merit or practice, then everyone who received a single word from a true master could enter the Dao, and why would the patriarchs and masters have labored so diligently to teach and transform others, enduring such hardships in cultivation?\n\nYongjia said: ‘The true nature of ignorance is Buddha-nature; the illusory, empty body is the Dharma-body.’ This refers to the blinking of an eye, the raising of a brow, the movement of an arm, or the use of a finger. Though this is so, why then are there those who fall into hell? It is because ignorance and illusion must be tempered and refined without remainder before nature and life are naturally united as one. Thus, one must enter through action.\n\nNon-action and action are not two separate paths; it depends entirely on what the time requires.\"\n\nConfucius said to Yan Yuan: \"When employed, act; when set aside, conceal.\" The choice between employment and retirement depends on the times; action and concealment follow the principle of adapting to the times. If one does not grasp this, then both advance and retreat lose their proper measure—how can the Dao be illuminated, how can affairs be accomplished? Truly, the principle of adapting to the times is of great significance.\n\nThe state employs both civil and martial means, never lacking either. In times of order, civil governance is put to use; in times of chaos, martial force is put to use. Change and response follow the times, alternating as substance and function, yet the Dao remains one. How could the teachings of our school differ in this regard?\n\nThis I heard from Master Changchun. The Master’s heart was most humble and yielding, vast in compassion and great in mercy. Every word he spoke was never the slightest bit beyond the truth. He often said: \"The Dao of non-action cannot be seen when looked for, cannot be heard when listened for, and cannot be reached even when pursued to the end. Even for one like me, who has attained longevity, doubts still linger, and halfway along the path, I nearly faltered. Thus, it is no easy task for later generations to practice. Nothing compares to accumulating merit and conduct—this is most effective.\n\nIf one is determined to cultivate merit and conduct, nothing surpasses hospitality. For all who pass by—when hungry, give them food; when weary, let them rest; in cold or heat, provide comfort. To bestow such virtue upon others—can this merit not be called supreme? If one maintains sincerity without wavering over time, then divine retribution will surely respond. Even if it has not yet arrived, external assistance will come. The subtle and manifest responses in the unseen are beyond full expression.\n\nWhat I have personally experienced, I have never spoken of to others. If one has accomplished one part of merit, to speak of it as one part is still within one’s proper duty. But if one claims it as two parts, all prior merit is nullified. To remain silent and not speak of it, the merit is doubled. Thus it is said: 'Seek not the knowledge of others, only the scrutiny of Heaven.' The *Classic* states: 'Virtue is built as if stolen.'\n\nIf one has performed a good deed and others slander it, yet one does not argue, the merit is also doubled. But if one argues, even if the slander is refuted, what benefit is there? For those who cultivate the Dao, there is not a moment when they are not in communion with the divine—why concern themselves with whether others know or not? The *Classic* states: 'The good do not argue.' Scholars must understand this principle.\n\nOne night in the abbot’s quarters of Tongxian Abbey, Zhao Zhiwan sang Master’s *Dreaming of Wandering as an Immortal*. When the song ended, the assembly rose to bow and asked for its meaning. The Master said:\n\nBefore Master Danyang left the household life, his nature was bold and unrestrained, and he loved to drink. Yet he had already begun practicing the methods of merit and conduct, for he knew that the root-source of the Dao lay within his own nature. When he first met the Patriarch, he recognized him as no ordinary man and asked: 'What is the Dao?' The Patriarch replied: 'Where the Five Phases do not reach, before father and mother were born.' Profound indeed are these words!\n\nIn my youth, I crudely studied yin and yang, and thus I know that all people are bound within them. Moreover, the Five Constants of human nature received in this life are the inclinations cultivated in past lives. Once habits form, they create resonance. For example, if one was fond of benevolence in a past life, in this life one will bear the phase of Wood; if fond of propriety, the phase of Fire; if fond of righteousness or wisdom, the phases of Metal or Water, and so on. Since inclinations vary, one inevitably bears the impure and mixed phases of the Five. This is called the resonance of habitual nature, also known as cause and effect. Present fortunes, careers, and social stations all arise from the cause and effect of the Five Phases.\n\nWhat habits does the original nature possess? Without habits, what resonance is there? Without resonance or habits, this is 'where the Five Phases do not reach, before father and mother were born.' Once practitioners recognize that what they love now is what they cultivated over many lives, they must completely eliminate it. They should begin by removing the most deeply ingrained habits, gradually eradicating all attachments until both mind and form are forgotten. Then, in a sudden awakening, they enter the realm of immortals.\n\nThus, the opening of this song says: 'Dreaming of wandering as an immortal.' If even a single deluded thought arises in the heart, it is like a cloud of confusion—it must be removed to attain clarity. Hence the lines: 'Gathering qi, pure and congealed, white clouds drift boundlessly.'\n\n*Zhuangzi* says: 'The breath of the perfected reaches to the heels; the breath of ordinary people reaches only to the throat.' Without true skill, practitioners cannot even reach the Central Elixir Field—how could they gradually deepen to reach the heels? The Master said: 'The perfected do not merely reach the heels—their light shines as one from top to bottom.' Hence the lines: 'Great radiance envelops the golden lotus.' The golden lotus is the heart.\n\nIf practitioners encounter adverse circumstances, they must not allow the slightest disturbance in their hearts. As the Chan school says: 'Even if an iron wheel spins atop the head, concentration and wisdom remain perfectly clear and unshaken.' Thus the song says: 'All are endowed with the power of virtue and Dao, spiritual penetrations and self-mastery. Even the force of kalpas cannot alter them. Further tempering refines habitual nature to the softness of silk, while the resolve to advance in the Dao remains as firm as metal and stone. Always abide above the myriad things, allowing nothing to stain or cling.'\n\nPractitioners must take virtue and the Dao as their root-source. Though external affairs may change endlessly, they are but illusory movements. Respond to them as they come, yet one’s tranquil true essence never stirs. It is like casting myriad vessels from yellow gold—their shapes differ, yet the true essence of gold never changes. Hence the lines: 'Responding to thoughts as they arise, without hindrance, for there is a root-source.'\n\nIf one’s heart has not yet perceived this, one cannot grasp the purport of these words. One must accumulate merit and conduct. When merit and conduct reach fruition, clarity will naturally respond. Until practitioners thoroughly penetrate the divine and perceive the Dao, this is the unvarnished truth. Let all take heed.\n\n*Record of the Northern Journey of Master Qinghe, Scroll Two* ends.\n*Record of the Northern Journey of Master Qinghe, Scroll Three* begins.\n\nDisciple Duan Zhijian compiled this. In the tenth month of winter, the gui-si year, at Tongxian Abbey in Yizhou, Guo Zhiquan was commanded to lecture on the *Daode Jing*. Its first chapter states: \"Mysterious, and again mysterious.\" Zhiquan said: \"This is the subtlety of the Limitless.\" The Master replied: \"Generally, when books employ reiterated terms, they do not fully express their meaning—this is not like the *Analects*’ ‘timely, oh timely!’ Rather, it reveals the wondrous principle that within Heaven there is yet another Heaven. All people are endowed with primordial qi at birth, and each possesses a Heaven within their nature. If every person could attain self-illumination and act wholly in accord with the Dao, then even without scriptural teachings, it would suffice. Yet because the multitude are led astray by material desires, they become deluded and cannot return. Thus the sages, grieving deeply, established these teachings to awaken and deliver them. Scholars must study the scriptures to fathom their application, valuing above all personal practice. Once practice is thoroughly mastered, one moves with ease in the central Way—what more is needed? Until one reaches this state, abandoning study is not permissible. As it is said: ‘People are born of primordial qi; those who obtain its purity become worthy, while those who receive its turbidity become foolish.’ This merely clarifies the broad outline, without touching upon its application. If one accepts this as truth, then the worthy remain merely worthy, and the foolish remain merely foolish—thus is the path of learning cut off.\n\nI have heard my Master say: ‘The Dao and qi transform and give birth to Heaven and Earth, nurturing the myriad things. Within this process, there is a supreme sageliness. Those who grasp its greatness become sages and worthies; those who grasp its lesser aspects become ordinary people, birds, beasts, and creeping things—these attain only a partial share. This is the most luminous of principles. Though the ten thousand kinds differ, their origin in the Dao is one. Since all emerge from the Dao, all possess the nature of the Dao. How much more so for humans, the most spiritually endowed of beings, who inherently possess the principle of returning to the Dao. Yet through many lives, they become deluded by habitual tendencies, losing their constant nature and unable to turn back. Now, through the teachings of the scriptures, this supreme principle is made clear. One should immediately accept it upon hearing, completely eliminating accumulated habits and deluded affections. Without seeking the Dao, the Dao is naturally attained.’\n\nThe *Yinfu Jing* has three chapters: the first, ‘Immortals embrace the One, acting without contrivance, naturally’; the second, ‘Enriching the state and pacifying the people through accumulating deeds and amassing merit’; the third, ‘Strengthening the army and achieving victory—when material desires and habitual tendencies harm our true nature, the two engage in battle. Only by overcoming them with the Dao can one succeed, and this is not possible without resolve.’ The scripture says: ‘Those who practice vigorously possess resolve.’ It also says: ‘Those who conquer themselves are strong.’ Whenever one’s likes and dislikes can be reversed—what is bitter to oneself benefiting others—when one diminishes and humbles oneself, enduring others’ mistreatment without resistance, this is the way of self-conquest. Initially, one practices with effort, but over time, it becomes second nature. Gradually, material desires are entirely purified, and the single nature becomes empty and void—what Chan Buddhists call ‘emptiness and quiescence,’ and our tradition calls ‘purity and stillness.’ Yet this is still not the ultimate. When stillness reaches the point where there is no place for stillness, one draws near. Even so, without true and solid merit and conduct, one cannot effect transformation. Without transformation, one cannot enter the true Dao. Only by entering the true Dao does one perceive the Heaven within one’s nature—this is the ‘mysterious, and again mysterious.’ At this stage, every word and action, all that issues forth, is nothing but the wondrous. Thus it is followed by ‘the gate of the manifold mysteries.’\n\nLecturing on the chapter ‘When all under Heaven know beauty as beauty,’ he analyzed six pairs of opposites, arriving at the sage’s engagement in ‘non-action.’ He said: ‘This is not the non-action that opposes action, but the non-action that leaves nothing undone.’ To illustrate, he cited the story of Yao yielding to Xu You. From a worldly perspective, Yao acted while Xu did not; from the perspective of the Dao, Yao was never not in non-action, and Xu was never not in action. Though Yao governed the vastness of the world, he regarded it as a temporary lodging, not possessing it. Thus, though the world was vast, it could not burden his heart. Was his yielding not non-action? Xu declined, saying: ‘You govern the world, and the world is already well-governed. I do not seek fame, for fame is but the guest of reality.’ He thus refused. Yet if the world were not already well-governed, what would Xu have done? He would surely have acted. Yao and Xu shared the same Dao; had their positions been reversed, each would have done the same. Thus it is said: ‘Yao was never not in non-action, and Xu was never not in action.’ Only by responding to change in a timely manner, acting in accord with the Dao, and remaining free of preconceptions in all situations can both be called sages.’\n\nThe Master said: ‘The roles of guest and host in learning the Dao must be clearly understood. Learning the Dao is the host; the myriad conditions are guests. In all interactions with conditions—whether matters of importance or trivial labor, all deeds and conduct—these are resources for seeking the Dao, and nothing is impermissible. Only one must not become attached. Once attachment arises, one loses the correct path. Today, many accumulate merit and conduct, yet few achieve merit without claiming it, acting without reliance. Once reliance and attachment exist, it is merely merit within the realm of action. If one performs all deeds and conduct without a heart of reliance or attachment, one receives the merit of emptiness and obtains natural blessings. Though called action, I must deem it non-action. All deeds, conduct, and worldly labors are truly resources for seeking learning, not for the sake of merit or fame. It is like farmers exhausting themselves in plowing and sowing, or artisans plying their crafts daily—their minds are set on securing sustenance, while plowing, sowing, and their crafts are but guests. One must engage in these activities all day without becoming attached to them. Even sages are not without such engagement; they simply do not make it their primary concern.’ Thus it is said: ‘Sages leave traces of engagement, but no mind of engagement. All their engagements are but traces.’\"\n\nOnce attached to traces, one immediately falls into duality. Only by not clinging to a single thing can one penetrate into emptiness and thus transcend duality. I have once said: \"Trample through emptiness to leave the six pairs behind.\" Yongjia also said: \"All conditioned things are impermanent and empty—this is the great perfect enlightenment of the Tathāgata.\" When cultivators embody this to the utmost, they enter the realm where things have never yet arisen. Master Shen said: \"Where the five phases do not reach, the time before father and mother were born.\" This is the ultimate.\n\nHere ends the explication of the chapter \"Not Exalting the Worthy.\"\n\nThe Master said: \"The meaning of this chapter encompasses more than half of the Dao and its virtue. Disciples must first comprehend its various names and forms; only then will they encounter fewer confusions when reading the scriptures. Terms like 'dragon,' 'tiger,' 'infant,' and 'maiden' all arise from the primordial qi and yin-yang. When Buddhists speak of 'teaching' and 'Chan,' the names differ, but the principle is one. If one can transform things within the heart, then nothing will not be at one’s disposal.\n\nThe chapter begins by speaking of governing the state, yet how is this different from governing the self? The heart is the ruler, and the hundred limbs are all subjects. When the ruler is well-governed, the state is well-governed; when the heart is well-governed, the hundred limbs naturally follow order.\n\nI recall when Master Dading questioned Master Xuan during an audience, discussing various methods of practice. Only visualization of the lower elixir field was deemed most essential—yet it was but one method, not the Dao itself. In recent years, Wang the Daoist of Yangzhou has taken this as the ultimate practice and taught it to others, unaware that such contrived methods of deliberate action can never lead to the true Dao. I have often said: Just as one may use techniques to force flowers to bloom in winter, they will never bear fruit.\n\nWhen he came to seek instruction, I told him the truth. Upon leaving, he remarked: 'To speak of nature without addressing destiny—what kind of teaching is this?' When not a single thing burdens the heart, and it remains clear and empty, then all twelve hours of the day become blessed with virtue. One does not seek a full belly, yet the belly is naturally full. Reduce and reduce again until not a single thought arises—then one’s will is weak, and when the will is weak, the bones are strong. This, too, is none other than the natural Dao. Beyond this, there is something called 'destiny,' but I know not what it is.\n\nGenerally, when disciples first set their minds on the Dao, none fail to be resolute. Yet many abandon their practice midway, for they seek quick success. When they do not soon see results, doubt arises, and this is why they give up. When the heart is not yet settled, it is like one afflicted with a grave illness who seeks out physicians. They follow the prescribed methods, but if no effect appears after some time, they seek another doctor. When that too proves ineffective, doubt arises. After repeated attempts, even if a renowned physician speaks, they no longer believe. They never pause to reflect on their own destiny.\n\nThose who attain the Dao—people see only their present accomplishment, unaware that it results from five, ten, or even a hundred lifetimes of accumulated cultivation. Only in this lifetime has it come to fruition. Have you not seen that before leaving the household, all true masters already possessed the foundation of the heart-mind? Master Yuyang once said: In his twenty-eighth year, Master Taigu was a diviner in the mountains of Shandong. One day, he casually wrote a poem whose meaning none but an accomplished Daoist could fathom. Later, upon encountering the Patriarch and entering the Dao, he said that attaining the Dao was not difficult. After forty days beneath the bridge at Wozhou, he completed the Dao—could this have been possible without the merit of past lives?\n\nWhen I resided at Yuqing Abbey, I witnessed the celestial gates open in the realm of vision. I once asked my master about this. He said: 'This is still not it. Compared to the completion of the Dao, such wondrous states cannot be described.' When the Dao-qi fills the interior, one is in a state of vague indistinctness, like the nine-four line of the *Qian* hexagram: 'Perhaps leaping in the abyss.' One probes and trusts in the great radiance that envelops the purple golden lotus.\n\nAt first, I did not understand, but after entering the Dao, I realized that this principle is inherent in everyone. When Master Danyang first opened the teaching, he spoke only of the ease of attaining the Dao. His disciples revered and believed his words, yet after three or five years, they saw no results. One day, as the assembly gathered, a senior disciple asked: 'Master, you say the Dao is easily attained. Yet when we observe those who have attained it, they all seem to have the good fortune of past lives—it cannot be accomplished in a single lifetime.' The Master glared and shouted: 'If you know this, why do you not immediately begin cultivation?' The assembly withdrew, convinced by his words.\n\nToday, I say to you all: Do not harbor doubt. Do not neglect your daily practice. When encountering adverse circumstances, do not let your heart waver. Each moment of forbearance is a moment of victory. Take care not to procrastinate or act carelessly, lest you accumulate the roots of transgression and surely fall. My divinations have never been false.\n\nHere ends the explication of the chapter 'The Valley Spirit Does Not Die,' incorporating the interpretations of various schools. The assembly requested the Master’s verification.\n\nThe Master said: 'The explanations of the various schools each have their reasons. Yet He Shanggong was a divine being, so his commentary is detailed on matters of nature and destiny but brief on external affairs—just as other schools rarely speak of inner cultivation. For those engaged in practice, none is more useful to receive than He Shanggong’s.\n\nThe chapter 'The Valley Spirit Does Not Die' represents the ultimate application of the Dao. Yet if beginners attempt to employ it, they will miss the mark. I say: One must first fully practice the meanings of the preceding five chapters before one can apply the Dao of the valley spirit. Thus, it is placed as the sixth chapter.\n\nI recall when my master was in Weizhou, resting in the flower garden’s thatched pavilion. I, along with Master Zhao Xujing, Master Lao Xiao, and the Dragon-Tiger Thousand-Household, attended him. The master expounded the great meaning of this chapter, saying: 'During the Dading era, when I had an audience at court, after presenting my memorial, I was graciously asked to transmit the Dao. I consented in my heart to teach the chapter on the valley spirit. Even an emperor of ten thousand chariots earnestly sought the Dao—how much more so one who truly possesses virtue and conduct, who is worthy of transmission. Yet one must first observe the precepts for seven days before it can be done.' He said: 'I cannot.'\"\n\nAfter reducing it to five days, he still said he could not. Further reducing it to three days, even the attendants considered it difficult, and so the matter was dropped.\n\nWhen I and Dan Yang both encountered the Patriarch to study the Dao, he commanded me to re-engage in worldly toil, allowing no respite. While Dan Yang and I silently discussed the mysteries, one day he shut his door. I secretly listened and heard him transmitting the method of the valley spirit’s immortal breath regulation. After a long while, he pushed open the door and entered, and I ceased my eavesdropping.\n\nAfter my worldly affairs were concluded, I diligently practiced the method I had overheard. Though I practiced assiduously, Dan Yang attained the Dao in two and a half years, while I endured ten thousand hardships for eighteen or nineteen years without verification. The Dao transmitted by the Patriarch was one and the same—why then such disparity in attainment? It was simply that each person’s accumulated merit and conduct differed in depth. Thus, the time of realization varied.\n\nDan Yang had cultivated for more than one lifetime; by this life, his merit and conduct were complete. Applying the Dao of the valley spirit at that moment, he swiftly saw its verification. My merit and conduct were incomplete, so even with prolonged practice, no verification appeared—this was only natural.\n\nThose who cultivate the Dao must first wholly abandon worldly affairs, uniformly cultivate the ten thousand practices, ensuring nothing burdens them, and focus the mind to utter emptiness, reaching the state of quiescence beyond quiescence. When merit and conduct are both complete, fortune arrives; with fortune comes the opening of the heart. A single point of radiance penetrates, and the root of heaven and earth—two things—naturally merge into one. Only then does one apply the ceaseless Dao to nurture it, filling it to fullness, and thus achieving immortality for endless kalpas.\n\nAs Zhang Pingshu said: *\"If the cauldron lacks the true seed, you merely boil an empty pot with water and fire.\"* Entry into the Dao has its gradations, all verified by the purity of fortune and virtue before advancement.\n\nNowadays, some do not cultivate solid merit and conduct to build their fortune but instead labor in vain imaginings, seeking to enter the true Dao—none avoid falling into emptiness. How lamentable!\n\nIn the past, at the hall in Shandong, a visitor came to inquire. Originally a wealthy merchant from the western route, he had encountered the Perfected Lord of True Yang, who transmitted a subtle secret. That very day, he abandoned his wealth, and worldly desires faded from his heart. The Patriarch only taught him to accumulate merit, cautioning him not to wander outwardly. If others came to know, they would inevitably show reverence, and over time, this would bring harm, making the Dao difficult to attain.\n\nThus, even with a true transmission, one must also accumulate merit and conduct to augment one’s fortune before achieving success.\n\nA disciple asked about the meaning of \"emerging from life and entering death\" in the scripture. The master said: *\"The commentary of He Shanggong may be consulted.\"*\n\nThe \"thirteen\" refers to the ten having three—namely, the four limbs and nine orifices, or the seven emotions and six desires. Emerging from them is the way of life; entering them is the way of death. Yet people, through excessive attachment to life, move toward the realm of death.\n\nThus, those who skillfully preserve life avoid entering the realm of death, and even tigers, rhinoceroses, armor, and weapons cannot harm them. Once a person has accumulated evil karma, they possess a realm of death, and malevolent qi follows them. Thus, they encounter adversity—all are repayment of past debts.\n\nIf one has no evil debts and interacts with others, harmony arises naturally. Harmony is not singular: there is superficial harmony and spiritual harmony. When countenances are harmonious and free of malice, it is superficial harmony, yet questions may still arise. Spiritual harmony occurs when the spirit harmonizes before familiarity, leaving no room for doubt. This arises from having no accumulated evil.\n\nAs Yongjia said: *\"When enlightened, karmic obstacles are originally empty; unenlightened, one must repay past debts.\"* Good and evil both have retribution. For instance, if I offer others a joyful countenance, they respond with joy; if I treat them with harsh arrogance, they inevitably retaliate in kind. This is the natural Dao.\n\nEven minor transgressions and compliances must be repaid. If one truly harms others or damages things, how could there be no retribution? To avoid retribution, one must avoid karma. Karma arises from the body; having a body means having karma. The seven emotions and six desires assail one internally and externally. Even with utmost restraint, one may fail; if indulged, transgressions multiply.\n\nMaster Yu Yang spoke most incisively: *\"If you wish to cultivate the Dao, first scold this false body.\"* The reason people’s karmic roots are not severed, leaving them with a realm of death, is all due to this false body. Only Master Dan Yang could cut off all karmic roots, eliminating the realm of death. If even a fraction of karma remains, a fraction of retribution follows.\n\nI have often said that all methods share a single principle. For example, diviners who assess a person’s fate might say that, generally, within ten parts, three parts are afflicted by malevolent stars, and their nature indeed has three parts of evil. Why? Because in their past life’s habitual nature, three parts of evil remained unresolved, and the malevolent stars were self-induced. When encountering circumstances, three parts of evil manifest. If the opposition has ten parts, then ten parts respond. Each follows the measure of one’s own share—whether encountering evil people or facing evil events.\n\nLike shadow following form, like echo answering sound, this principle operates everywhere without exception. The ignorant, failing to examine themselves, may meet someone who, for no reason, treats them with malice, and they wish to resent that person. Yet if their own evil remains unremoved, their evil only multiplies, surpassing the original offense by who knows how many times. This is why people often grow fully evil without self-awareness.\n\nIt is better to eradicate one’s own evil entirely, leaving no opposition—how then could external evil arise? Those who cultivate the Dao focus solely on self-governance. Whether dwelling alone or among hundreds, they only govern themselves. Once this principle is understood, one must take responsibility in the present moment; otherwise, the next life will be no different.\n\nWhy is this so? It is because the seeds of habit remain embedded within one’s nature. This is called \"seed-nature.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Master, you have said that humans receive the nature of the Five Phases, all transformed by habitual tendencies—does this follow the same principle?\"\n\nThe Master replied: \"Indeed. If one can reverse this tendency, then one lifts heaven and earth, grasping the ungraspable within yin and yang and the Five Phases. Thus, the Patriarch once said: *In the midst of shattering, inquire into that single point, and you will surpass the divine boat to reach the shore.* Only when nothing in the heart obstructs anything else is perfection attained. If even one thing remains untranscended, one has not yet succeeded.\"\n\nWhen the Master first sought the Dao, he resolved with unyielding determination, shattering his heart. Even the most stubborn habits could not withstand a hundred days without being entirely purified. He once said: \"I fear no ferocious tiger, yet when I saw temple statues, I felt dread. So I deliberately visited them often, even lodging in their halls. After three years of this, the fear vanished.\"\n\nThus, we know that whatever difficulties arise in the heart are but passing emotions. With resolute will, none cannot be overcome—only a lack of resolve is the obstacle.\n\nWhen the discourse on the *Carrying the Po and Embracing the Qi* chapter concluded, the disciple asked the Master for verification.\n\nThe Master said: \"The works of Laozi and Zhuangzi do not fully express their meaning; without attaining the Dao, their subtleties are hard to grasp. Chan sayings resemble riddles, perplexing to the uninitiated—not because they are deliberately obscure, but because their truths transcend language, leaving no choice but to speak thus.\"\n\nZhiquan asked: \"Does Chan resemble the teachings of Laozi and Zhuangzi?\"\n\nThe Master replied: \"Chan focuses on revealing the fundamental nature. Its wonders do not exceed what Laozi and Zhuangzi described. Thus, it borrows their words to convey its profundities; without such language, there would be no means to point to them. The mastery of Chan’s expressions allows one to play freely with them—yet without attaining the Dao, none can forget them.\"\n\n\"Moreover, must those who attain the Dao all come from scriptural study? Before scriptures existed, were there no such people? Master Yuyang attained the Dao before reading the *Daodejing*. Yet when expounding its teachings, one must rely on words.\"\n\n\"This chapter on *Carrying the Po and Embracing the Qi* is like taking a person by the hand to instruct them in cultivation. I recall Master Bingwang, who sought the Dao with unwavering resolve, forgetting form and world, eating without regard for taste, merely filling his stomach. For four years, his practice aligned perfectly with this chapter’s principles.\"\n\n\"One day, in stillness, I felt qi surging upward, and a sound erupted at the crown of my head. My skull seemed to split open, and a sweet fluid descended abundantly. Afterward, no further signs appeared, and doubt arose. I sought the Patriarch’s hall to inquire.\"\n\n\"Whenever a resident had doubts, the Patriarch never refused them. He sternly rebuked me, asking what doubts could remain in one who cultivates the Dao. Knowing my sincerity, he permitted repeated questioning.\"\n\nHe said: \"Have you not read the *Daodejing*’s words on the opening and closing of the heavenly gate?\"\n\nThereafter, the Patriarch often questioned me. When he learned that no further signs appeared, he instructed me to reside in the abbey, accumulating merit through service. Thus, even with arduous practice, without completing the work of virtue, attainment remains unfulfilled.\n\nWhen Master Yuyang was still a householder, he knew not what he desired, and after leaving home, he remained undefiled. Later, on Iron-Fork Mountain, one night he experienced a lapse and wept bitterly, wishing to consume it. The heavens responded by bestowing the qi of harmony. Three days later, he regained his heart-ground. Only then did the thousand refinements and hundred trials begin: he knelt among sand and stones without rising, his knees worn to the bone. The mountain was full of sharp rocks and thorns, yet he walked barefoot among them, earning the name 'Iron Feet.' After three years of this, his past karma was finally exhausted.\"\n\n\"Those who seek the Dao must understand this principle.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"There are those who accumulate much merit and practice, yet cannot attain great blessing—why is this?\"\n\nThe Master replied: \"It is only because they consume what they receive as soon as they receive it. This is like a man who accumulates wealth, spending it as soon as he gains it—he will never become truly rich.\"\n\nThe Master said: \"When Master Yuyang saw my stable of horses, he sighed and said: 'Horses have once been men, and men have once been horses.' In my twenty-seventh kalpa, I was a cow, and thus in this life my nature remains dull and unable to recognize written words. The cow-mother once came seeking my deliverance.\"\n\nThe Buddhist teaching says: \"Those who attain the Dao can liberate their parents of three lifetimes.\" But I say: they can liberate the billions of ancestors across ten thousand generations.\n\nThe Master said: \"Elder Changsheng foretold many events before their signs appeared—it would be difficult to recount them all. For instance, he summoned Old Master Ji to the hall, and within days, Ji passed away. He also called Official Zhu the Second without cause, and after seven days, Zhu departed. Old Ji—known as Ji of Mount Gang—had made his living through the yin and yang of the two dwellings. Abandoning wife and children, he left home with great resolve and dwelled on Divine Mountain for fifteen years, never once glancing back at his former gate.\"\n\nElder Changsheng asked someone: \"Who in Laizhou is the wealthiest?\" When told of the richest, he said: \"None are richer than Master Ji of Mount Gang. He has already attained the fruit of purity—even if gold and jade covered the earth, how could they be bought? Is this not the greatest wealth?\" Though Official Zhu the Second had not yet reached such a heart-ground, his merit and practice were vast.\n\nWhen the lecture reached the chapter \"Favor and disgrace cause alarm,\" the Master said: \"To speak plainly within our teaching, this is easily understood. A single phrase can resolve it: 'Beware of clinging to the false.' Once you know the body is false, you must not cling to it—clinging loses your true self. Thus, to have no body is not to abandon the body, but simply not to possess it. If you do not possess the body, how much less the world? The sage does not abandon the world, but treats it as entrusted, as borrowed, without possessing it. Favor and disgrace—why should I be alarmed by such things?\"\n\nGuo Zhiquan said: \"In the *Liezi*, the chapter where a man from Zheng obtains a deer illustrates that those who do not know the Dao err in matters of gain and loss, taking delusion for reality. The one who truly caught the deer mistook it for a dream and lost it. Another, hearing his deluded words, obtained it—and both took their gain and loss as real. Yet neither knew that what was gained or lost was not genuine, so the magistrate ordered it divided. Thus, all fortuitous gains and losses are like dreams—why then be deluded into alarm by favor and disgrace?\"\n\nThe Master said: \"Most people do not recognize dreams. The Patriarch said: 'If in a dream you recognize the dream-body, you are free and have reached the other shore.' Dreams have roots, and thought is their root. Thoughts have truth and falsehood, and dreams follow accordingly, like shadows clinging to form. Not only are night dreams dreams—every thought is a dream. What distinguishes truth from falsehood? Only that which does not harm virtue, power, spirit, or qi is true; all else is false and delusory. Even sages have thoughts, yet in responding to the ten thousand thoughts, they never lose their truth, for truth is their root.\"\n\nThe Master’s father said: \"Responding to thoughts as they arise, with no obstruction—this comes from having a root.\" Those who know the Dao, whether slandered or praised, favored or disgraced, undergo a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations without their hearts ever stirring. Why? Because they have seen through this dream-illusion.\n\nIt is said: \"In dreams, the six destinies are vividly clear; upon waking, the great thousand worlds are empty.\" The *Liezi*’s tale of the man from Zheng who obtained a deer speaks only of gaining and losing in delusion—this is nothing but a warning against having a mind attached to things.\n\nThe Master said: \"When grain first sprouts, from the moment it sends forth shoots and spreads leaves until it ears, it may all be called grain. Yet only when it forms kernels does it attain the substance of grain. Harvested and stored, transformed into food, able to become seed again—this is the true use of grain. However, some sprouts do not ear, some ears do not form kernels. If left unweeded, they fail to mature; if forced to grow, they are harmed—both lose the Way. Only by planting and weeding at the proper time, awaiting their natural completion, do they succeed.\n\nLearners, from the initial stage to the attainment of the Dao, may all be called 'on the Way,' yet only when they enter the true Dao do they attain its substance. Some, through laziness, stop halfway; others, through haste, harm themselves. Even those without such excess or deficiency may nurture what they have gained without reaching true realization. Or, unable to conceal and await the proper time, they boast and display themselves, becoming teachers and models. A little light scatters, never to be regained—this is what is meant by 'sprouting but not ear-ring, ear-ring but not forming kernels.'\"\n\nWhen the lecture reached the chapter \"Seen yet not visible,\" the Master said: \"Understanding this chapter’s meaning is precisely the practice of our own teaching. Master Danyang fully embodied the ancient Dao of non-action. As for Master Changchun, he taught people to accumulate merit and practice, preserving non-action while engaging in action. He took the ancient Dao as his guiding principle to govern all present circumstances.\"\n\nThe scripture says: \"One who knows the ancient beginning holds the thread of the Dao.\" All learners must first take hold of their own Dao-nature as their guiding principle, then accumulate merit and practice to respond to conditions—there is nothing they cannot apply. Master Danyang said: \"From the non-action heart arises compassionate mind; true practice and true merit all belong to it.\" When merit and practice reach completion, the heart-ground naturally awakens, and the sages grant them the Dao.\n\nYet why do those with merit often harbor a mind that relies on their practice, expecting the Dao in return? If they can forget even this mind, they attain 'acting without attachment.'\"\n\nMaster often said: \"The small measure of Dao-qi I possess today was not obtained through non-action and tranquil sitting, but through the great exertions of worldly toil and merit-making—bestowed by the sages and worthies. Those who attain the Dao all reach this point through the completion of merit and practice, whereupon the sages and worthies naturally grant it to them.\n\nMaster Danyang attained the Dao while begging for alms; Master Changzhen received it while traveling on the road; Master Changsheng sat in the Luoyang tile market for seven years before obtaining it.\"\n\n*Pure Harmony Perfected One’s Northern Journey Record, Volume Three Concludes*\n*Pure Harmony Perfected One’s Northern Journey Record, Volume Four*\n*Compiled by Disciple Duan Zhijian*\n\nMaster also recounted: \"Xu Shenweng was greatly filial at home, hiring himself out at a tavern for three years, offering all his wages to support his mother. In worldly toil, he shunned no task, no matter how light or heavy, doing whatever he saw needed doing. One day, a guest painted a crane on the door of the tavern and asked about it. When Shenweng came out to observe, the guest glanced back at him once—whereupon Shenweng received the transmission. Immediately, amidst the bustling crowd, he sat in tranquil oblivion, and after seven days, his heart awakened to the Dao.\n\nHad he not first accumulated vast merit and practice, how could this have come to pass? Precisely because he possessed them, the sages and worthies came to enlighten him.\"\n\nThe painter of the crane was none other than the transformed body of Pure Yang. As for Ma Ziran, he had known the Dao from an early age, practicing austerities and cultivating diligently, yet by sixty-four he had still not attained realization. One day, in a fit of resolve, he prepared to drown himself in a river to cast off his body. Suddenly, someone appeared and said: \"Your merit and practice are already complete—only this one step remains.\" Thereupon they stopped him, and indeed, after a hundred days, he completed the Dao.\n\nLooking at these two masters, one followed the way of non-action, the other the way of action. To clarify the true meaning of non-action and action is truly difficult to distinguish. What matters is that merit and practice reach fulfillment, and attainment will naturally follow.\n\nThe Master once said of himself: \"When I first set my resolve to learn the Dao, I grasped my heart-mind and inwardly observed it, reaching a state of such utter stillness that even the most spiritually attuned ghosts and gods could not perceive me. Yet suddenly, a single stray thought arose, uncontrollable and beyond all effort to restrain. There is no other reason for this—only that my merit and practice were still lacking. Had they been complete, the sages would have come to guide me. Let no learner doubt this.\"\n\nHere ends the discourse on the chapter *\"Of Old, Those Skilled in Being Scholars.\"*\n\nThe Master said: \"The principles have been thoroughly analyzed, yet their application remains unexhausted. Long ago, the venerable Master Wang of Xianyang, well-versed in the scriptures and teachings, once came to the hall. I asked him: 'What text are you studying today?' He replied: *'The Avataṃsaka Sūtra.'* I bade him expound its meaning. Then I said: 'Every sentence holds wondrous application, yet it is a pity that you can expound but not yet clarify it.'\n\nThis chapter serves as a great admonition for those who study the Dao: one must guard against the flaw of holding the Dao while wishing to remain unknown. If others come to know of it, harm will follow. Like hiding pearls and jade, carelessness invites theft; one must be vigilant and hesitant, like crossing ice in winter, ever fearful of loss, ever fearful of discovery. Thus, one must be as wary as if surrounded by neighbors, solemn as a guest, never daring to act recklessly—this is vigilance in externals.\n\nYet one must also be as fluid as melting ice, as uncarved as raw wood, as open as an empty valley—this speaks of the inner nature. Guarding the outer while protecting the inner, one still preserves the old to avoid becoming new, all to achieve the great completion. Thus the scripture says: *Great vessels are late in completion.*\n\nToday’s learners, if they possess even a glimmer of illumination, become self-satisfied and fear others will not know. Unable to firmly preserve the old, they are like what Yuyang called 'wildflowers.' At the outset, learning the Dao seems easy to attain, but the deeper one probes, the harder it is to perceive.\n\nLong ago, a Daoist from afar wished to come to the mountain and bow before the hall. Before arriving, no one lacked reverence, imagining all within the hall to be realized adepts. Yet upon arrival and meeting them, after only a short while, seeing nothing particularly extraordinary, their reverence waned. Little did they know that the deeper one probes, the harder it is to perceive a person—this is why the profound cannot be recognized.\n\nThe Master often engaged in casual conversation with others, speaking of mundane matters for days on end. Those who heard it for the first time could not help but be astonished. Amidst the busyness of worldly affairs, the Master attended to each task personally, even peeling hemp. The disciples in the hall called him 'Old Man Qiu.'\n\nMaster Shan once harbored doubts and asked me about this. I replied: 'One cannot judge a realized person by their words or trivial actions. Once the nature of the Dao is attained, in responding to the world, though one may speak all day, it is as if one has not spoken at all. When speech ends, one returns to their nature—is this not like how the turbid, over time, slowly clears, and the tranquil, over time, slowly stirs to life? How could it be like worldly people who force themselves to speak of the Dao while their inner minds unknowingly harbor mundane thoughts?'\n\nThose who study the Dao differ in this: their original resolve is for the Dao. In all worldly affairs, they act as they move, laboring without refusal. Since one cannot yet escape daily worldly tasks, how can one shirk such merit and practice? Yet once the task is done, all is forgotten, and one returns to the nature of learning the Dao. If even the slightest trace lingers, Chan Buddhists call this 'abiding in form.' What matters is that the heart of the Dao be weighty. When the heart of the Dao is weighty, though external conditions may be many, all will be subdued.\n\nPracticing in this way naturally aligns with the great purport of the scripture. Its five thousand words, whether stated directly or in reverse, aim only to lead one to see the Dao. One should combine the eighty-one chapters into a single chapter, then reduce that chapter to a single sentence, and that sentence to a single word. Even that word must be cast aside and returned to swiftly—for it is not the Dao that can be spoken.\"\n\nHere ends the discourse on the chapter *\"Attain the Utmost of Emptiness.\"*\n\nZhiquan again said: \"The phrase *'In stillness for a day, one returns to the mandate'*—I still cannot fathom its depths. May I ask for further instruction?\"\n\nThe Master replied: \"There is no principle in the scriptural teachings that is not clear—only the matter of *xing* and *ming* is difficult to understand. Long ago, Li the Daoist from Shandong was skilled in discoursing on the subtleties of principle. People called him 'Elder Li,' and he was a companion in the Dao to the barefoot Master Liu. One day, he asked me: 'Does a person’s nature come from the father or the mother?' I gave him a casual answer, for it is indeed difficult to explain. Later, at fifty-eight, Li still harbored doubts and thus withdrew to return to lay life.\n\nThus it is known that learning the Dao requires thorough investigation of principle, yet one must not seek it excessively. Excessive seeking is like the overgrowth of plants—endless and chaotic.\n\nI recall Master Meng, who was convalescing at Pingyu Hermitage. One day, he went out and saw a pregnant woman drawing water. Meng bowed to her and said: 'I am about to die and shall be reborn through you—you will be my mother.' The woman, hearing this, fled in alarm. Not many days later, he indeed passed away. The woman gave birth to a girl whose crown bore the faint mark of a cap. She was named Meng Xian and is now five years old.\n\nAlso, the father of my uncle in the Dao, Yu the Official, once lived in the mountain hall. He dreamed of wandering through a place of pavilions and terraces, where the beauty of the flowers and plants was beyond anything in the human realm. Further on stood a pavilion where several immortals sat playing chess. A young attendant held a chess piece and stood by.\"\n\nYu bowed and offered his respects, inviting the immortals to let his attendant ascend. Observing Yu’s longing gaze, the immortals then entrusted the boy to his care and departed. Yu awoke with a start—at that very hour, his wife had given birth to a son. Later, when the boy was fifteen or sixteen, he showed no fondness for worldly affairs. Though married, he lived apart from his wife for three years, and his kin sought to censure him severely. Only then did his father recall the dream of that day and allowed the boy to follow his inclinations. After his father’s death, he met Master Danyang and left the household life.\n\nFrom this we may ask: is a person’s nature truly received from the father, or from the mother? Does it enter before the fetus is formed, or after? Yet there are also those conceived through a mother’s perception—stepping into a giant’s footprint, or the case of Duanmu of Guzhu—such are the natural workings of true responsiveness. To exhaustively trace their origins is impossible.\n\nThe Master once said: “The phrase ‘leisurely contemplating karmic conditions’—the word ‘leisurely’ carries profound meaning. Though a practitioner may not yet fully grasp the principle, they must simply refrain from doubt. One should only accumulate virtuous deeds and amass merit; the Dao resides therein. Never deceive Heaven, never wrong others. Form a bond with those who have attained the Dao, and deepen it to the utmost. In this life and the next, they will guide you to completion.”\n\nThe Master also said: “My bond with the Patriarch has always been deep. In the days at Pan Brook, I was forbidden to eat salt and not allowed to sleep before midnight. Even in trivial matters, I received his guidance. One night in a dream, I saw the Patriarch seated with an infant on his lap, about a hundred days old. Upon waking, I felt a stirring in my heart and knew my Dao-nature was still shallow. Half a year later, I dreamed the same scene, but the child was now about two years old. Awakening, I realized my Dao-nature had gradually grown. Later, I found myself free of evil thoughts. A year passed, and the dream recurred—the boy was now three or four, able to walk and stand on his own. After that, I no longer saw him, for I knew the guidance had continued until I could stand firm on my own.\n\nIf one wholeheartedly seeks the Dao, they will surely encounter a perfected being to awaken them. Yet without true merit and sincere practice, such an encounter cannot occur. For every fraction of merit a cultivator accumulates, their heart gains a fraction of peace and clarity. In all matters, one must weigh and respond. When great honor or disgrace arises—things others find hard to bear, or that the world cannot tolerate—one who can lightly let them pass, who can endure, accept, and embrace, has truly ‘dissolved’ them. This is the blessing of practicing the Dao.\n\nPractitioners should remember this crucial point: do not seek it through cleverness or force. If the Dao could be attained by strength of will or intellect, then the strong-willed and powerful would all achieve it—but such a principle does not exist.”\n\nThe Master expounded three chapters: *The Great Dao in Decline*, *Abandoning Sagacity*, and *Discarding Wisdom*. He said: “Every word of the scriptural teachings is a wondrous function. Only when one’s heart already holds this principle will what they hear resonate deeply. If the heart lacks it beforehand, the teachings cannot enter.\n\nThe meaning of these three chapters is this: as the Dao and qi declined, the sages established teachings suited to the times. Since the loss of the Dao, we have relied on virtue; when virtue waned, we turned to ritual—all unavoidable responses. Consider the Quanzhen school: the teachings of Master Danyang differ greatly from those of Master Changchun, yet this too is unavoidable. Confucius taught benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom—but was his Dao truly limited to these? The sages embraced the Dao yet did not abandon benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom, for these were needed to address the times. Once their purpose was served, they returned to the Dao.\n\nThe cultivator inwardly preserves their true nature. In benevolence, they act with benevolence; in righteousness, with righteousness; in propriety, with propriety; in wisdom, with wisdom—yet never lose their true nature. Amidst the world’s decline, they alone can return to antiquity. Practitioners need only inwardly guard their true nature, responding to all circumstances without attachment. Though I live in this age, I have never failed to preserve my true nature. Even in dreams, I still wear my novice’s robe, transforming worldly tasks into alms-food. Though leaving the household life does not exempt one from worldly conditions, as long as one never forgets their Dao-nature, there will surely be a future. If one dedicates this life single-mindedly to the Dao, even if reborn, they will still be a devoted practitioner.\n\nYet some who leave the household today do not reflect on this principle. They seek to place themselves above others, fearing only the loss of their superficial reputation. Before others, they close their eyes and clasp their hands in a posture of ‘sitting in forgetfulness’; when no one is watching, they do as they please. Though they call themselves Daoists—are they truly Daoists?”\n\nThe Master concluded the chapter *Cutting Off Learning Brings No Sorrow*, saying: “Learning is not difficult; cutting off learning is difficult.” He recalled the *Ten Exhortations* of Chan Master Ma, the fourth of which reads:\n\n*I exhort you, fourth: Broad learning and much hearing prick the heart.\nForget feelings, exhaust perceptions, and cease all striving—\nThen whatever you grasp will be without error.*\n\nWhen feelings are forgotten and perceptions exhausted, there is no striving or seeking. It is because of feelings that views arise; if not striving, then one is grasping. The scripture says: *See the plain, embrace the uncarved; lessen self-interest, reduce desires.* The “plain” refers to one’s inherent portion; recognizing it, one embraces the uncarved. “Self-interest” refers to personal bias; “desires” to craving. Self-interest cannot be entirely eliminated, but by lessening it, desires diminish.\n\nThe sages expounded at length to make these principles known so that people might practice them. Yet those who neither know nor study remain ignorant; those who study but do not practice what they know waste their efforts. The wise who do not act—how far are they from the foolish? ‘Excess is as bad as deficiency’—this is precisely what it means.\n\nThose without learning do not understand the meaning of the sacred texts and often despise those who do. Hearing the saying *Cutting off learning brings no sorrow*, they take it to mean that learning itself is wrong, not realizing that those without learning are even further astray. Did the sages not wish for people to learn? Their warning is for those who, having learned, still cannot forget their learning.”\n\nYet scholars may encounter points where principles and meanings resist clear resolution—these should be set aside for the moment. What cannot be grasped now may come naturally later. To recognize one’s own ignorance is already a form of knowing. Confucius said: *“To say you know when you know, and to say you do not know when you do not—this is true knowing.”* One must not pretend to knowledge by force. The scripture’s words *Cutting off learning brings no sorrow* warn against those who, though learned, cannot forget their learning—such people will have sorrow. If the saying meant that learning itself should be abandoned, why would the sages have spoken five thousand words?\n\nThough a Daoist may not have extensively studied the *Yinfu*, *Daode*, and *Qingjing* scriptures, how could one not study them at all? Let us discuss the chapter *“The Bearing of Great Virtue.”* The Master said: I recall our teacher once asking us, *“Which among the scriptural teachings comes closest to the Dao?”* Shan-gong first answered with what he had realized, while I replied with this chapter. *“The Valley Spirit does not die”—*its profundities are hard to perceive, yet this chapter alone suffices for practice. *“Vague! Elusive! Within it there are images.”* When one’s practice reaches this point, they will see for themselves.\n\nThough the Dao is obscure and difficult to perceive, what *can* be seen is virtue. When applied to things, it becomes meritorious action; traced to its source, it truly arises from the Dao. Manifest in benevolence, concealed in function—Dao, virtue, merit, and action all share a single origin. There has never been one without the mind of Dao who possessed true virtue. Even those at the initial stage of practice can discern this: who has the mind of Dao, and who does not. All things, good and bad, naturally reveal themselves. Thus, when pointing them out, one might say, *“By this you may see,”*—it is not difficult.\n\nThe text also says: *“Within it there is essence; that essence is most real.”* These words have endured from ancient times to the present, for it is by this supreme essence that all beings are transformed and born. Therefore, in learning the Dao, one must not allow even the slightest dust-like thought to arise, lest the spirit scatter and dissipate.\n\nThere is a saying in Chan: A woman riding in a cart passed by a gate, and a monk, chancing to see her, fixed his gaze upon her. The cart then grew heavier, for his spirit had already been carried away by it. Master Yuyang spoke even more directly: *“Those who cling too deeply to things will destroy their own nature.”* Our teacher also said: The vital essence in a person’s corpse may, after many years in the coffin, transform into a *wangliang*—is this not a kind of luminosity? Thus we know that a person’s light is dispersed among things. Consider a bowl of water poured into a hundred bowls—none can be completely emptied, each retaining some moisture, yet the original water is gone.\n\nA person’s light must not be scattered. When the light is great, the nature is great; when the light is small, the nature is small. Using this light to examine others, nothing false escapes detection. But if one can turn the light inward to illuminate oneself, then the light remains entirely within. Only those of resolute will can grasp and preserve it, preventing its loss.\n\nYet without the support of true practice and solid conduct, transformation cannot occur. Someone once asked our teacher about this, and he replied: *“Cultivate hidden virtue outwardly, and inwardly secure the spirit.”* Thus we know that even with spirit, without merit and action, the Dao cannot be attained. However, when performing good deeds for others or for things, one must not harbor a sense of reliance or entitlement. Our teacher had a poem:\n\n*Do not ask how the celestial mechanism works,*\n*Only cultivate hidden virtue and recite the long watch.*\n*Human sentiments, though fickle, are all the path of immortals—*\n*In daily practice, exert yourself to the utmost.*\n\nIf there is even the slightest sense of reliance, it is called “attachment to form,” and the merit diminishes.\n\nWe also know that non-action and action have no fixed form. Non-action that clings to something becomes action; action that clings to nothing becomes non-action. How could there be a fixed form?\n\nThe Master said: Many people use their own light to illuminate the faults of others, leaving nothing unexamined, yet if they could turn that light back upon themselves, they would no longer dare to see the faults of others. Our teacher, whenever he saw someone’s fault and wished to instruct them, would always begin by saying: *“We are all beings of the same nature.”* Only then would he speak of their fault. His meaning was that he and the other shared the nature of sentient beings, and as one who had awakened first, he sought to awaken those who followed. His way of teaching was so thorough.\n\nFor those of middling or lesser capacity, he would clearly point out the way, but for those with spiritual discernment, he would merely hint at the meaning and let them realize it themselves. Since following my teacher, I have observed his every movement, silence, and word—all were teachings, depending only on how the student responded. If one truly investigates and devotes oneself, progress will naturally follow.\n\nToday’s learners should examine themselves and not scrutinize the faults of others. By practicing in this way, one will gradually gain realization.\n\nThe Master said: I have heard that teaching requires adaptability, using expedient means to transform others—yet this may risk losing the truth. I have always embodied my teacher’s words, none of which were not grounded in reality. He often said: *“My mind knows expedient means, but my mouth cannot express it.”* I once discussed this with Master Wanyan. At first, we spoke of expedient means, but over time, it became habitual speech, turning into ordinary words without our realizing it, and the mind followed suit. This is something learners must deeply guard against.\n\nThe Master said: Learning the Dao lies entirely in a single thought. When that thought arises, it is progress; when it lapses, it is regression. Only by advancing without cease is one truly learning the Dao. Consider the hundred crafts and skills, or any practical endeavor—they all require arrangement and preparation before they can be done. Learning the Dao requires no such arrangement or preparation. It is simply a matter of clarifying the mind and dispelling desires, and one can practice at any time, in any place—whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down; in cold or heat; living with others or alone—there is no situation where it cannot be done.\n\nLearners must seize the moment and take up the task, just as the predecessors would grasp a single word and practice it.\n\nThose who often cling to fixed notions—saying, \"I will begin at such-and-such a time,\" or \"I will comprehend at such-and-such a time\"—day after day, their resolve and qi gradually wane, and they ultimately achieve nothing.\n\nThe lecture on the chapters *\"The One Who Stands on Tiptoe Cannot Stand Firm\"* and *\"There Is a Thing, Formlessly Formed\"* concludes.\n\nThe Master said: The world possesses its natural principles, yet most people remain unaware of them. Those who know will never act contrary to nature. Affairs are either true or false—this distinction must be made clear. Those who have not yet awakened mock falsehood with falsehood, never realizing their own delusion. The learner of the Dao first discerns truth and falsehood within the mind and nature. Whether in moments of attainment or non-attainment, one uses the scriptures as proof, aligning the scriptures with one’s nature. When the mind and scriptures merge, one remains free from delusion for life.\n\nMaster Yuyang initially did not read books, yet his words accorded with the scriptures—this was because he grasped their essence. Today, some deeply understand the words of the scriptures but do not know their root. Clinging to the language of the ancients, they become even more confused. The ancients’ words are not mere words—they are words beyond words. If one only grasps the subtlety of their language but fails to apply it wondrously to one’s own nature, it is entirely useless.\n\nIn learning the Dao, only when one recognizes the mind, sees the nature, and attains true emptiness does one truly succeed. One must exert every effort in practice. Master Yuyang once said:\n*\"Since meeting the companion of true emptiness,\nI have cast aside all worldly passions.\"*\n\nMaster Changsheng once wrote a hundred and twenty *Ruizhegu* poems in a single brushstroke, one of which reads:\n*\"Before the inner heart verifies, the heart of form is a demon—\nThe tighter you grasp, the more thoughts multiply.\"*\n\nMaster Danyang said: *\"Tightly grasping, tightly seizing gives rise to fivefold brilliance,\"* which perfectly matches this.\n\nMaster Changsheng said: Before attaining true emptiness, the more you try to grasp, the more thoughts multiply. Master Danyang said: Once true emptiness is attained, the inner content unfolds, and one must apply effort to hold it fast—hence *\"tightly grasping, tightly seizing gives rise to fivefold brilliance.\"*\n\nMaster Changchun’s *Yaolishengmie* lyric reads:\n*\"Having attained the celestial jewel of nature,\nI see through the spring flowers and autumn moon.\"*\nThis is the realm of true emptiness. It further states:\n*\"In times of exhaustion,\nGhosts cannot summon you—\nOnly the immortals can uplift you.\"*\n\nEarlier, it spoke of *\"tempering body and mind a hundredfold,\"* then of *\"attaining the celestial jewel of nature,\"* yet it still speaks of *\"only the immortals can uplift you.\"* Who but one of utmost truth and sincerity would dare utter such words? The Chan school takes true emptiness as complete realization and often mocks these lines, asking: *\"If one has already attained the celestial jewel of nature, why still speak of immortals uplifting you?\"* I say they truly do not understand.\n\nThe *Qian* hexagram speaks of six dragons: At *Initial Nine*, *\"The hidden dragon does not act\"*—firm and unshakable. At *Nine Two*, *\"The dragon appears in the field\"*—its radiance naturally manifests. At *Nine Three*, *\"All day long, vigilant and cautious, as if in peril\"*—only then does one avoid blame. At *Nine Four*, one draws near to the heights and communes with the divine, sometimes ascending, sometimes descending, now hidden, now visible—hence *\"perhaps leaping in the abyss.\"* Leaping is ascending; in the abyss is returning below. In this state of vagueness and obscurity, one still requires the uplifting of sages and worthies. Only at *Nine Five* does one attain boundless transformation. Before this, one must temper body and mind a hundredfold, and only then, with the uplifting of immortals, can one reach this stage.\n\nIf learners of the Dao do not first temper body and mind a hundredfold but instead seek the Dao directly, how can they possibly attain it? Master Yuyang once said: *\"A Daoist refused to cultivate, claiming, ‘I practice non-action.’ Recklessly indulging himself, he provoked the authorities and was beaten to death. He waited to practice non-action, yet non-action struck him dead instead.\"* He also spoke of two kinds of seeing the nature and two kinds of true emptiness. *\"Realizing that all things are illusory and empty, yet knowing one’s own nature is true—this is also seeing the nature. Once known, one must practice it. Through practice to its utmost, one sees the nature again. Initially awakening to the Dao is true emptiness; reaching the ultimate point is also true emptiness. Only when true emptiness is attained and merit and practice are complete does the Dao’s blackness naturally burst through. The Dao’s qi resides in the nine apertures of the body, closing them effortlessly. Only at this stage does one truly enjoy its benefits.\"*\n\n*\"One hand grasps mine,\nOne hand points to the void—\nThree horizontal, one vertical, two like this:\nNo gate, no door,\nFour directions, eight reaches,\nThis is the realm of the Primordial Beginning.\nIf the nature of sentient beings is not yet exhausted,\nAnd one relies on the mind’s power to block the nine apertures,\nThen left closes while right opens,\nMutually disrupting, uncontrollable.\"*\n\nThese words were never lightly disclosed; today, they are specially revealed. I have received them with reverence. All this pertains to the nature of humanity—only because people fail to preserve and guard it do they not reach this realm. At the first glimmer of light, they refuse to humble themselves, becoming arrogant and self-satisfied, seeking to distinguish themselves from others—thus they cannot achieve great illumination. Just as water gathers more deeply the lower it flows, so too does the accumulation of virtue in a person. Those who have truly attained something should conceal it even more deeply. If one carelessly reveals even a single word, the loss is no small matter.\n\nIt is like those in the world who endure countless hardships to accumulate wealth, yet through a single moment of carelessness, they offend others unjustly. Once the matter escalates, their wealth is spent in a single day—how great is the loss! Thus it is said: *\"Accumulation is difficult, but preservation is even more so.\"* Only by preserving oneself, recognizing that beyond one’s nature all things are illusory, detesting them like filth, and regarding them as leftovers or superfluous growths—only then has one truly reached the state of nature.\n\nIf one does not truly know that superfluity is ugly but instead adds a head upon a head, claiming, *\"This is what I possess, what others lack,\"* boasting and praising oneself without self-awareness—how can such a person hope to understand the Dao of nature? It is truly difficult.\n\nThe lecture on the chapter *\"He Who Knows Others Is Wise\"* concludes.\n\nThe Master said: The scriptures state, *\"He who dies yet does not perish is long-lived.\"* The meaning is perfectly clear.\n\nThe Venerable Master Yuyang once said: *\"The worthy become ghosts after death, while the foolish are swept away by things and transformed.\"* I say: the worthy must have lived with worthy conduct, thus earning the name of worthiness. Even in death, I truly consider them undying.\n\nHe also said: *\"He who conquers himself is strong,\"* and *\"He who acts with strength has resolve.\"* For those who cultivate the Dao, subduing the heart and advancing in practice, resolve must be their foundation. Without resolve, even a single unpalatable meal will not settle in the chest—meaning the myriad spirits will not accept it. But those with resolve, though given only coarse food, will not suffer illness. When resolve is mighty, the myriad spirits follow, and even things change in response, so that one no longer perceives the bitterness of taste.\n\nHumans possess myriad spirits, yet without resolve, they cannot be led. When great resolve is put into action, it is like a great general marching forth—all the qi of the body assists it. What then cannot be overcome? Mencius said: *\"Resolve is the general of qi.\"* I have practiced this with great efficacy, and thus believe it all the more.\n\nThe scriptures say: *\"He who does not lose his place endures.\"* The word *\"place\"* is like that in the story of Zichan ordering the warden to raise fish, where the warden replied, *\"They have found their place!\"* The words of the scriptures are meant first to be understood, then applied for one’s own use. If one clings to the words without putting them into practice, they become a hindrance instead.\n\nYet the scriptures often repeat themselves in varied ways, and it is most important that one grasp this. They say, *\"He who acts with strength has resolve,\"* but also, *\"Weaken your resolve.\"* They say, *\"To learn is wrong,\"* but also, *\"Not to learn is wrong.\"* They say, *\"Stillness is wrong,\"* but then, *\"Movement is also wrong.\"* Such reversals and shifts have no fixed meaning. They are meant to guard against excess or deficiency in the learner, lest one cling to one side. Thus, they guide from both left and right, leading one to stand upon the central Way. This is what the learner must deeply investigate.\n\nThe chapter *\"Holding the Great Image\"* is expounded here, drawing from various scholars’ interpretations. Among them, Su Ziyou states: *\"The Great Image is the insipid, the Dao that transcends sight and sound, beyond what the eyes and ears can perceive.\"* To grasp this Dao above is to ensure that all under heaven will come to you—like the allure of sweet bait or the art of governance. A fleeting good government may indeed draw people close, like travelers pausing at an inn, yet it cannot endure.\n\nThe Master remarked: *\"Those who explain the scriptures and awaken to the root of the Dao do so without wasted words—Ziyou’s insight is apt.\"* Zhuangzi likewise said: *\"Benevolence and righteousness are but the temporary lodgings of the former kings.\"* This is the same idea.\n\nZhiquan noted: *\"The annotations to Chapter Fifty-Four often follow the *Zhenghe* edition, which frequently cites the *Book of Changes* and *Zhuangzi.*\"*\n\nThe Master replied: *\"The Three Mysteries are fundamentally one. Emperor Huizong of Song possessed an innate affinity for the Dao, hence his reliance on them. To know this is not difficult; to practice it is the true challenge. When I first entered the Daoist gate, I saw only the virtue practiced by the elders. Later, upon penetrating this scripture, I realized it was all the path they had walked before. Today, all external affairs in the teaching are no different from using sweet bait to detain passing travelers—one must not cling to them. One should relinquish the path trodden by those before, yet not lose its essence. Those who now advance in their Daoist practice do not suffer the hardships of worldly people, and this must have its causes. They did not arrive here by chance. If one seeks the root of this, it is truly found in the study of the Dao—how could one ever forget it for a single day?\"*\n\nWith this, the lecture on *\"The Highest Virtue Does Not Act as Virtue\"* concluded.\n\nThe Master said: *\"The scripture states: ‘The highest virtue does not act as virtue, and thus possesses virtue; the lesser virtue does not lose sight of virtue, and thus lacks virtue.’ Applying this to the affairs practiced within the teaching makes it readily apparent. One who quietly accumulates merit and conduct without seeking recognition does not regard it as virtue. Since one does not claim virtue for oneself, this is called the highest virtue. Not making others aware of it may seem as though one has lost virtue, yet I say: when virtue is concealed, it becomes all the more present—is this not truly possessing virtue? Thus, it is said, ‘and thus possesses virtue.’ If one’s merit and conduct are made known to others, it may seem as though one has not lost virtue, but this is lesser virtue. Once others know, they will inevitably show reverence, and one’s virtue gradually diminishes. Thus, it is said, ‘and thus lacks virtue.’ If merit and conduct are used to cultivate fame, they will dissipate with time—how can they be applied to the emptiness of the Dao? What, then, is truly one’s own?\"*\n\nThe lecture on *\"The Dao Gives Birth to the One\"* followed.\n\nThe Master said: *\"The Way of the sages is fundamentally simple. Few learners attain clarity in this principle, for they cannot forget their daily pursuits and self-nature. Whatever does not align with the sages is merely one’s own disposition. One must utterly cast aside this self-nature to naturally harmonize with the sages’ ‘Dao giving birth to the One.’ In Chan practice, when one reaches this point, it is true thoroughness. Yet if one cannot stabilize here, other complications arise. Master Shao Yaofu once said: ‘Look upon the wind’s howl and the night’s chill—who stands firm at the gate?’ I have often reflected: profound and wondrous teachings should not be shown to the masses, for those of middling or lesser capacity who hear them often misapply them. In the past, there was one who studied the Nature School with great clarity yet disregarded the precepts, doing as he pleased. A realized master asked: ‘Is this not a seed for hell?’ The man replied: ‘What harm does this do to the Dao?’ Such is the extent of its corruption.\"*\n\nThe chapter on *\"In governing people and serving Heaven, nothing surpasses frugality\"* is expounded as follows.\n\nThe Master said: *Frugality* (啬) means cherishing care—cherishing the Dao. This is the daily practice of the learner. This single word is the essence of the entire chapter. *Taking* (服) means consuming, and *taking early* (早服) means savoring the flavor of the Dao. *Accumulating virtue in abundance* (重积德) begins with diminishing the self to benefit others, extending to governing people and serving Heaven. When the function of the Dao is fully realized, it penetrates Heaven and Earth. Thus, in learning the Dao, accumulating virtue is the great foundation. Only with true virtue can one savor its flavor—what Daoists call *reaping its benefits*. Learners all know that when the mind is free of杂念 and the qi flows harmoniously, this is *reaping the benefits*. Yet few truly taste its flavor, for they do not know the importance of accumulating virtue. Without true merit and virtue as the root, there is nothing to be gained. Even if one exhausts the mind in striving, whether for a year, ten years, or even a hundred, there will ultimately be no attainment. When merit and virtue are accumulated, one does not seek attainment yet attains naturally.\n\nWhat is *true merit and virtue*? It is acting without reliance, not considering one’s own virtue as virtue—this is true merit and virtue.\n\nThe chapter on *\"Acting through non-action\"* is expounded as follows.\n\nThe Master said: The scripture states, *\"Repay resentment with virtue.\"* The sages speak of what is most difficult for people in the world. If even repaying resentment is done with virtue, then in all other matters, virtue is surely applied. Yet people of the world cannot practice this; they return resentment with resentment, never ceasing, until calamity becomes inescapable. The sages seek to sever its source, hence this particular teaching. If learners can grasp this principle, how can resentment ever arise?\n\nThe chapter on *\"He who is brave in daring will be killed; he who is brave in not daring will live\"* is discussed by various schools, some emphasizing benefit, others harm. One view holds that bravery in not daring brings benefit, while bravery in daring brings harm. Su Ziyou’s general interpretation states: *\"Not daring leads to life; daring leads to death—this is the great constant of natural principle.\"* Yet sometimes the daring survive, and the cautious perish—these are exceptions. The world then gambles on these exceptions, neglecting the constant principle. Observing Heaven through the eyes and ears, seeing only its curvature and not its wholeness, none fail to doubt the coarseness of Heaven’s net and its many omissions. Only by grasping its beginning and end, exhausting its transformations, can one know its vastness—though coarse, it does not err.\n\nThe Master said: Ziyou’s explanation is apt. Who knows the causes of these exceptions? The causes of benefit or harm are such that even sages find them difficult to fathom. *Difficult* here implies doubt. (Alternatively, *difficult* may be read in the departing tone for greater clarity.) Though doubted, there is ultimately no room for skepticism. My teaching speaks of *cause and effect*: if a person possesses even a fraction of goodness, yet their karmic obstructions remain unresolved, though the reward may not manifest immediately—even after a hundred or a thousand lifetimes—once the obstructions are dissolved, that fraction of blessing will be received. The same applies to evil. Viewed in its totality, it is like Heaven’s net—vast and all-encompassing. Good and evil are inevitably repaid without omission; thus, though coarse, it does not err.\n\n*Record of the Northern Teachings of Master Qinghe, Volume Four—Concluded.*",

      "translated_text": "**The Recorded Discourses of Master Qinghe on His Northern Journey**\n\n**Title:** *The Recorded Discourses of Master Qinghe on His Northern Journey*\nRecorded by Yin Zhiping of the Yuan, compiled by his disciple Duan Zhijian. Four fascicles.\nSource edition: *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Orthodox Section, Part One.\n\n**Preface to *The Recorded Discourses of Master Qinghe on His Northern Journey***\n\nI have observed how Nanbo Zikui inquired of Nü’ou regarding the hearing of the Dao, who replied that he had heard it from the son of Fumo, and the son of Fumo from the grandson of Luosong, extending through Shanming, Nieshu, Xuyi, and Yu Shu, until reaching Xuanming and Canliao, and finally to the very beginning of doubt. This demonstrates that unless one is born with innate knowledge or perceives the Dao with a single glance, one must rely on cultivating the mind and refining one’s nature, gradually attaining realization through progressive awakening—advancing from daily accumulation to daily reduction, from action to non-action—until the Dao is perfected, immortality achieved, and one abides in the world. Such a process indeed follows a proper sequence.\n\nYet if the teachings of Daoist cultivation, the words beyond words, were to cease, how could they endure? Master Qinghe Yin, the Perfected, transmitted the Dao of his teacher, Master Changchun, and succeeded in overseeing the great teachings of the world. He reopened the gates of mystery, proclaiming and reviving the orthodox tradition, like the auspicious star or the vermilion phoenix, drawing all to eagerly observe his virtue. Within his community, those who cast off their worldly robes and shoes numbered no fewer than a thousand, while beyond, devotees traveled from afar to offer supplies and seek his guidance. His reputation and virtue spread across the Central Plains and the borderlands, and the world unanimously revered him as a master of his generation.\n\nThe Perfected once journeyed to Beijing to conduct the ritual offerings for the Prefectural Envoy Hou Jindao and others. His disciples compiled *The Recorded Discourses of the Northern Journey*, a collection of exchanges between master and disciples, discussing scriptures and doctrines. With earnest clarity, he employed plain language to point to the ordinary mind, upholding the essential principles of the mysterious Dao, and resolving subtle truths—truly a guidepost for entering the Way.\n\nPrefect Du Dekang of Qin Prefecture intended to have the text carved into woodblocks for wide dissemination among the faithful and reclusive scholars of the four directions. Thus, it was arranged into two fascicles, hoping that readers might awaken through its words and together attain longevity. How could this not be commendable?\n\nAlas, now the Perfected has withdrawn from the hall to a life of leisure, sitting in stillness all day, preparing to wander with the Creator in the realm of nothingness. Even his face is no longer seen, let alone his words. On the first day of autumn in the year *qiangyu*, Li Jin of Gutao inscribed this.\n\nFormerly, Confucius once told his disciples, *\"I wish to speak no more.\"* Zigong replied, *\"If you do not speak, what shall we, your disciples, transmit?\"* Thus, the sages invariably conveyed the Dao through words. If it were otherwise, how could the Dao be made manifest?\n\nNow, Master Qinghe Yin, the Perfected, left home in his youth and followed Master Changchun for over fifty years. From morning audiences to evening inquiries, he never rested, standing out among his peers as exceptional. Thus, he was entrusted with the master’s teachings and placed in charge of the school’s affairs, earning the world’s reverence. During moments of leisure, he would expound the wondrous principles of the Quanzhen tradition to the assembly, often discoursing all day without weariness. His words were concise and apt, his explanations of principle readily understood—markedly distinct from those who, in discussing the mysterious or expounding the subtle, merely confuse the crowd.\n\nFearing that his teachings might be lost, his disciples each recorded what they had heard, compiling them into this single volume, entitled *The Recorded Discourses of Master Qinghe*, divided into two fascicles. It is hoped that cultivators of the Dao from all directions may read and study it, thereby more easily entering the Way.\n\nAs the effort to complete the work was not yet realized, he had previously sent a letter to Prefect Du Dekang of Tongchuan, inviting the master to journey south. Upon hearing of this, the prefect was delighted and ordered the text to be block-printed, intending to preserve it for posterity.\n\nOne day, Wang Zhining, the director of Taiping Xingguo Abbey in Pingyao, along with Li Zhifang, earnestly requested that I compose a preface. Though I dared not refuse, I also admired the deep sincerity of these noble gentlemen. Thus, I have briefly recounted the facts to elucidate the work’s origins.",

      "translated_text": "On the day of the Beginning of Autumn in the seventh month of the ding-yu year, inscribed by the Old Man of Nanxuan, Zhang Tianzuo.\n\nThe Great Dao is without form; the supreme principle is without words. Since the formless Dao cannot be seen, how can the wordless principle be made clear? Yet how is the principle made clear? It is made clear through words. However, when put into words, it no longer resembles itself—thus the noble ones of antiquity were compelled to speak. Their words had a source; with a source, the principle emerges through words as a guide. From this, we know that the principle lies beyond words, and when one grasps the principle, words are forgotten. Hence it is said: the supreme principle is without words. Without words, there is no form—thus it is said: the Great Dao is without form. To perceive the formless Dao and speak of the wordless principle—who but one who has truly attained true knowledge could do so?\n\nOnce attainable, it may be spoken of—expounded at length without excess, summarized without omission. This is what it means to be dynamically aligned with method and statically attuned to the ultimate, merging mysteriously with the Dao. Yet how easily can one encounter such a person in this world?\n\nNow, the Perfected Qinghe has succeeded the Perfected Changchun, presiding over the teachings of the Mysterious, accumulating years of service. Cultivators of the Dao from all directions come daily to his seat seeking instruction, their numbers never waning. With time, their reverence deepens; from afar, their intimacy grows. Those who vie to behold him are as drawn as to the auspicious star or the phoenix. How magnificent is this perfected one! In daily life, he meets all with sincerity and benefits others with compassion. Though he seeks no protection from others, others protect him—truly the refuge of humans and heavens.\n\nOne day, Director Zhang Defang of the Abbey and others presented several fascicles of records from the Perfected One’s northern journey, saying: \"Among the disciples of the late Master Changchun, none knew the master as deeply as you. The trust he placed in you was profound. Now, we intend to carve these writings into woodblocks. If you could compose a preface to spread the aspirations of later learners in all directions, would that not be splendid?\"\n\nI humbly declined, saying: \"What words of mine could be called literature? The Perfected One’s Dao is pure, his learning profound—he is a towering figure of our age. Having truly attained true knowledge, whether speaking or silent, his every word and phrase has long been recorded into books. Why would they need my words to be transmitted?\"\n\nDefang replied: \"Not so. To lift a fur robe, one must grasp its collar; to ascend the hall, one must step upon the stairs. We hope you might lend a single phrase to draw forth the profound and reveal the ultimate, placing it at the beginning of the volume. This would allow learners to lift the robe by its collar and ascend the hall by its stairs—no small aid.\"\n\nI dared not refuse further and thus took up my brush to grant their request.\n\nInscribed in the early autumn of the geng-zi year by Li Zhichang, the Perpetual Teaching True Constancy Master.\n\n---\n\n**Record of the Perfected Qinghe’s Northern Journey, Fascicle One**\nCompiled by Disciple Duan Zhijian\n\nIn the autumn of the gui-si year, at Huayang Abbey in Beijing, the assembly gathered for an evening sitting.\n\nThe Master said: \"Now that the autumn cool has arrived and the nights grow longer, do not retire early. Without waiting for a summons, come together for conversation. There is no need for every sentence to discuss the mysterious and the Dao. Even matters of the ancients’ successes and failures, or the good and evil of the world—nowhere does the Dao not reside. When praising another’s goodness, one admires it oneself; when speaking of another’s wrongdoing, one detests it oneself. With the mind holding admiration for goodness and aversion to evil, there must naturally be a heart that chooses and rejects. If one acts with resolve, one may reach the realm of perfect goodness. If one speaks with benefit, even the listener gains caution and profit. But if the mind wanders carelessly, failing to discern others’ goodness or fault, one’s own conduct will likewise lack discernment. Indulging in habit and expediency, one drifts into evil, never reflecting. Though discussing success and failure, good and evil may not fully embody the scholar’s Dao, it is still beneficial—better than eating one’s fill all day and indulging the heart.\n\nMoreover, the greatest hindrances to cultivation are the three desires: food, sleep, and sensuality. Without moderating food, one sleeps excessively, and sleep is the gravest—it is the source of emotional desires. If learners can first restrain these three desires, they truly enter the gate of the Dao. Though all know this, few can restrain them. Restraint depends on will, while its undoing lies in qi. Will leads qi. When will is weak and qi strong, it cannot prevail. To restrain them, first reduce daytime sleep. Progress day by day, month by month, without seeking quick results. Naturally, turbid qi will not arise, and one will gradually find it easier. When I was in Shandong, I did the same. At the slightest sense of drowsiness, I sought activity. Day after day, by the twenty-fourth or twenty-fifth day, it became effortless, and my mind grew clear and bright. All of you should practice this.\n\nIn learning the Dao, even if one has not yet reached the state of penetrating heaven and earth, first becoming a cautious and prudent noble person is no loss to oneself. Indeed, all great sages and worthies emerge from this. Others only know indulgence as joy, unaware that restraining the heart brings boundless true joy.\"\n\nThe Master said: \"Recently, I have greatly wished to speak less, but due to the karmic conditions of the teacher’s role, I must speak. Yet teaching others brings vast benefit. When I resided at the abbey in Shandong, I practiced a way of generosity and ease, teaching others the same. For over a decade, no disputes arose. In managing a monastery, exhorting the assembly to honor the worthy, embrace the multitude, and live in harmony without contention is truly a field of blessed action. At the time, if one or two among the assembly were disobedient, the vast majority would not tolerate them. I too showed them forbearance, fearing only their downfall. If they risked harming matters, I could not avoid slight reproach, but it was always done skillfully, so they could accept it. Not only did I spare myself distress, but those who had erred could more easily reform.\"\n\nAt the abbot’s hall of White Crane Abbey, the Master sat with the assembly. Someone offered fresh plums, which were shared.\n\nThe Master then recounted an anecdote from the Sui dynasty: \"At that time, the realm was unified, and within the palace, the Three Mountains, Five Lakes, Four Seas, and Sixteen Courts were constructed, planting every rare flower and exotic fruit within them.\"",

      "translated_text": "At that time, in the western courtyard stood a yangmei tree, which in a single night spread its vines so vast they shaded an acre. Yang was the surname of the Sui, and all took this as an auspicious omen. In the eastern courtyard grew a jade plum tree, which likewise flourished. When they bore fruit, the yangmei proved sour while the plum was sweet, and people abandoned the former for the latter. There was also in the pond a great carp with the character *wang* (king) upon its brow. Later, when the Sui fell and the realm turned to the Tang—whose imperial surname was Li—people then understood the portent.\n\nThus it is known that the rise and fall of dynasties follow a fixed decree, driven by the revolutions of the Five Phases and the shifts of qi, which cannot but be so. All that dwells within yin and yang is bound by fate. Only in heaven, where there is neither yin nor yang, does pure yang abide. Looking down upon the turning of the sun and moon, one sees that time and destiny lie beyond the sway of qi. How then could there be cycles of cold and heat, spring and autumn, prosperity and decline?\n\nYet humans dwell within yin and yang, and so are turned by them, unaware that there exists something beyond their alternations. Those who study the Dao do not contend with things. When matters arise, they pass through them lightly, and when fortune and misfortune, long life and early death, birth and death, transformation and change unfold before them, their hearts remain unmoved. This is to stand beyond yin and yang, to dwell above heaven. In this way, the heart attains constancy, and things naturally align. One roams freely within the world of phenomena yet is not turned by it. First, the heart must be free; only then can things be made equal.\n\nThus the opening chapter of the *Zhuangzi* speaks of the \"Free and Easy Wandering,\" which carries deep meaning.\n\nA disciple asked, \"Is constancy the Dao?\"\nThe Master replied, \"Constancy is true constancy. The heart responds to myriad changes yet is not swayed by things. Abiding in constant response and constant stillness, one gradually enters the true Dao. Constancy is the Dao.\"\n\nThe reason people fail to attain constancy is that their hearts lack a master, and their emotions flow with external things, their qi dissipating through the many apertures. As *Mencius* says of the will, \"The will is the commander of qi.\" If one can command qi with the will and prevent its dissipation, it transforms into radiance, accumulating into great luminosity. The Master’s father once said, \"Great luminosity envelops the golden lotus.\" The lotus symbolizes the heart, where spirit and clarity reside. Only by first attaining constancy can one reach this state.\n\nConfucius spoke of the \"Middle Way,\" which is also the meaning of constancy. There is also a saying: \"Buddha-nature is fundamentally not awakened; sentient beings are originally not deluded. In the ordinary workings of the heart, this is bodhi.\" Those who do not know constancy act recklessly and court misfortune; those who know constancy attain clarity.\n\nThe disciple asked, \"Is there no difference between what the Buddha teaches and what you teach?\"\nThe Master replied, \"In principle, there is no difference. The Buddha’s teachings, my teachings, and even worldly teachings all contain wondrous truth. It is only when one comprehends it in one’s own heart and nature that one naturally perceives it. At that time, even heart and nature are no longer needed.\"\n\nThere is a saying: \"Neither heart nor nature—only when there is no heart and no nature does one attain the divine and the sagely.\" Another says: \"When someone comes seeking the Dao, you must transmit it to one who is enlightened. If a person’s heart is not first open, how can words be conveyed?\"\n\nOn the ninth day of the seventh month, the day of Master Changchun’s ascension, the Seven Perfected Ancestors were enshrined at the Hall of Fragrant Osmanthus in White Crane Abbey, and offerings were made. After the rites, the Daoist assembly sat together and spoke of worldly affairs, rejoicing that their tradition enjoyed peace and tranquility.\n\nThe Master said, \"Today we dwell in safety, eat our fill, and cultivate virtue. How could we not know the source of this blessing? It is because our ancestors possessed extraordinary natural endowments, accumulated vast merit, and awakened to the great Dao. Having perfected themselves, they then perfected others, shaping and refining them. The successive Perfected Masters, one after another, instructed and transformed, illuminating the ground of the heart, exhaustively investigating the roots of sin and fortune. Many attained thorough understanding. Through a thousand trials and ten thousand hardships, their accumulated merit and conduct grew ever greater, enabling the flourishing of the teaching as it is today.\"\n\nMaster Changchun once said, \"In a thousand years, the Daoist tradition has never been as prosperous as it is now.\" Yet the Master spoke with humility, and his words did not fully express it. From the time of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi to the present, the tradition has never been as prosperous—this is the work of heaven’s decree. As the world’s ways gradually decline, heaven raises up sages to uphold it. In high antiquity, governance was through the Dao; later, it was through benevolence and righteousness. As customs further declined, Buddhism entered China, using heaven and hell to exhort the people. Now, in our time, the ancestral masters have arisen to propagate the teaching. Though only seventy years have passed since its inception, the accomplishments are already so great.\n\nThe Perfected Masters established great expedient means to aid the people. Yet after more than twenty generations, Buddhism’s accumulated merit and conduct were profound, and its teachings brought great benefit to the world. Later generations failed to uphold them, leading to decline. This is because when people long enjoy blessings, karma inevitably arises.\n\nAll must deeply understand this and take heed. Recently, I have observed that among our disciples, some sit idly enjoying their blessings, indulging their hearts, and gradually straying from virtuous conduct. This is the beginning of karmic action, and they drift ever farther from the Dao. Human nature is originally not far from the Dao, but through many lifetimes of being submerged in desire, it becomes difficult to return to it. Thus Confucius said, \"By nature, people are close to one another; by practice, they grow far apart.\" If one can be cautious in one’s habits and not be burdened by things, focusing the heart on emptiness, then the teachings one hears will naturally be understood.\n\nAll that I have received as teaching was transmitted orally and received in the heart from the Perfected Masters. I have practiced it to this day, and how could I not wish to pass it on to later generations? Yet few listen with sincere hearts, so I often wish to remain silent. Even those who have heard the teachings, if they do not practice them, are no different from those who have not heard. Teachings are like talismanic registers: if one holds to them, they are efficacious; if not, they are but empty words.",

      "translated_text": "What benefit does this bring to either party? Master Liu of Barefoot Old Liu once told me: \"Master Tan should complete the Dao early. When we used to beg for meals together, I saw him examine his heart daily. At dusk, he would review the thoughts that arose from dawn, and each day at noon, he would review the thoughts that arose from the previous night. Day after day, he never slackened in the least.\"\n\nMaster Tan said: \"Master Danyang completed the Dao in two and a half years, Master Changzhen in five, and Master Changsheng in seven.\" My own blessings are meager and my resolve weak; after eighteen or nineteen years, I have only just reached the point of penetrating heaven and earth, where the sages and worthies grant me a small measure of radiance—yet before long, it is taken away again. This I have heard with my own ears.\n\nAs for the merit and conduct he accumulated, the hardships and toils he endured—even the most stubborn and unyielding person would be moved to the heart. Through the accumulation of hardship and merit, great blessings were formed, extending his transformative influence throughout the world. Nowadays, among his disciples, even those whose merit and virtue have not yet reached such heights readily accept his blessings. If one cultivates the heart, keeping every thought on the Dao, or diligently serves and attends to others, this may suffice to dissolve such karmic debts. But if not, one risks losing one’s original nature.\n\nHaving been born in the Middle Kingdom, having encountered the true teaching, and having left behind worldly entanglements—if one does not advance in cultivation but merely enjoys its blessings, how could one hope to enter the Dao again in future lives? If one indulges in blessings to excess, accumulating karmic deeds day by day, not even the human form can be preserved. Is this not losing one’s original nature?\n\nAn ancient saying goes: \"To invite a life of future discontent.\" This is precisely the case. Accumulating good deeds brings blessings; accumulating evil deeds brings karmic retribution. This is not the result of a single morning or evening. People see small good deeds as offering little benefit and so do not perform them; they see small evils as causing little harm and so do not abandon them. Yet when these accumulate, they grow vast and inescapable.\n\nAs it is said: \"Drops of water, trickling little by little, gradually fill a great vessel.\" How could one not be cautious!",

      "translated_text": "The ancestral masters and all true masters were of one heart and one virtue, establishing this teaching so that the four seas might regard it as one family. Generally, those within our gate share the same gains and losses: when one advances in the Dao, it brings honor to the teaching; when one commits a transgression, it becomes a burden to the teaching. This is especially something one must not fail to be cautious about—only, do not act in ways that belong to the hells. When a person commits a transgression, hell already exists in their heart. The Buddha spoke of Avīci, and also of \"no questioning.\" Our teaching speaks of Dengdu—none of these can be denied.\n\nA Daoist disciple named Nianhe asked: \"I have often inquired about cultivation among fellow disciples. Some teach arduous refinement, while others advocate preserving naturalness. May I ask which is correct?\" The master replied: \"The Dao cannot be transmitted through words. One must first possess it in the heart before one can enter. Even the true masters cannot bestow the Dao upon others; they can only teach the accumulation of merit and virtue as the foundation for entering the Dao.\n\nMaster Changchun once said: 'Dan Yang and I both awakened to the Dao, but to different depths, which is why our attainment differed in speed. Dan Yang directly awakened to death, so his attainment was swift. I awakened to the illusory nature of the ten thousand things, so my attainment was slower. To awaken to death is to immediately regard oneself as dead—just as a violent person, once dead, can no longer be violent. To awaken to illusion is not yet to reach death, for one still engages in scheming and doing, which causes a slight delay.' This principle is not obscure; it is simply that awakening varies in depth, depending on the thickness or thinness of one’s accumulated merit and virtue. Thus, the predecessors never lightly discarded even the smallest act, such as picking up a needle or a blade of grass. The ancients said that even an inch of time is precious; a single moment without merit or practice is a waste. Even a single meal—how can it be repaid?\n\nCultivation must proceed from the coarse to the refined, accumulating the minute to achieve the manifest. Those with strength in the teaching should exert their strength; those with devotion should apply their hearts. Managing affairs and harmonizing the community—all of this is merit and practice. Only then can one’s clothing and food be properly accounted for. In my daily life, when I receive offerings from others, I humble my heart to repay them. When I was first in Weizhou, the old Dragon-Tiger Householder often invited our group of ten or more to stay at his home, providing for us for several months. Before ten days had passed, some among us already felt stifled, even falling ill. They could not even find diversion in playing the qin or chess. Yet I remained at ease, free from care, never once unsettled. This was because I had no fixed heart—moving only in response to fate, gathering in my emotions, never letting them stray outward. Even those who served me closely, I did not recognize their faces or know their names. Moreover, I never ate more than half my fill—how could I not be at peace?\n\nThe human heart must have its attachments, but the danger lies in not aligning them with what is right. If one’s attachments lie in external things, then no matter whether they are good or bad, they lead one astray. If one’s attachment is to the Dao, then this heart is wholly aligned with what is right. Once the heart is right, external temptations and deviations naturally lose their weight. Day by day, they grow lighter, until nothing remains. The karmic consciousness that has followed one through many lives of transmigration and change is then cast aside. Even the desire for the Dao is ultimately relinquished, leaving only vast emptiness—yet within it, there is something that is not empty. Thus it is said: 'Neither existence nor emptiness—this is called true emptiness.' Without cultivating the heart, how can one attain this? Therefore, in cultivation, refining the heart is essential. Once one understands gain and loss, one reverses all worldly affairs in the heart. Then the qi within the body naturally follows, the hundred bones are regulated, the nature comes to rest, the breath is harmonized, the life-force is secured, and one is not far from the Dao of immortality.\n\nYet today’s learners do not follow this path. They open their mouths to speak of the profound and wondrous, often falling into emptiness and delusion, and I have yet to see any who succeed. They then transmit this delusion to others, leading many astray. Everyone knows that immortals are to be admired, yet no one is willing to exert effort in practice. Thus, attaining the Dao of immortality is like hearing that steamed buns are edible: if one truly wishes to eat, one must first plow the fields and sow the seeds. If one were told to seek food in the earth, all would laugh at such folly. Yet in the end, no one obtains food without cultivation. Is the path to immortality any different?\"\n\nThe master said: \"Those who are new to learning do not understand nature and life. They mistake daily speech and action for nature, and the breath entering and leaving the mouth and nose for life—this is incorrect. Nature and life are not two separate things. First, one must exhaust the heart to recognize the true nature before birth by one’s parents; then one will understand the life bestowed by Heaven. The *Book of Changes* says: 'Exhaust principle and fulfill nature, to reach life.'\n\nThe master said: \"Humans observe the qi of the Five Phases to come into being, and thus their natures follow accordingly. For example, the nature of wood is often benevolent, and the nature of fire is often proper—this is the case. Yet none of these are our original true nature. One must transcend the Five Phases to see one’s true nature.\"\n\nMaster Hao Taigu seemed most plain and simple, yet when he received a single meal from someone, he would silently recite ten scrolls of scripture in return. Can later generations afford not to attend to such meticulous conduct? The master visited Youxian Abbey, where the abbot, Li Zhishao, bowed and asked about his doubts regarding the *Wuzhen Pian*. The master did not answer.",
      "overlap_context": "sely the case. Accumulating good deeds brings blessings; accumulating evil deeds brings karmic retribution. This is not the result of a single morning or evening. People see small good deeds as offering little benefit and so do not perform them; they see small evils as causing little harm and so do not abandon them. Yet when these accumulate, they grow vast and inescapable.\n\nAs it is said: \"Drops of water, trickling little by little, gradually fill a great vessel.\" How could one not be cautious!",

      "translated_text": "That night, seated among his disciples, the master addressed them: \"Zhang Ping Shu’s lifelong accumulation of merit and conduct has profoundly moved one individual, clearly pointing toward enlightenment, and thus his words carry wondrous insight.\" He then recited three of Zhang’s *Xijiangyue* lyrics:\n\nHeaven and Earth have just passed through negativity and prosperity,\nDawn and dusk must recognize the cycles of hardship and obscurity.\nLike the hub turning with the axle, or the tide following its source,\nThe marvel lies in the art of subtraction and addition.\n\nAttain the One, and all things are complete—\nNo need to divide north, south, east, or west.\nReduce again and again, guarding past merit with care,\nFor the treasure of life must not be trifled with lightly.\n\nWhose is the maiden of sixteen,\nAnd where is the lord of nine-three?\nThey call themselves Wood-fluid and Metal-essence,\nYet when Earth is met, the Three Natures form.\n\nWith the aid of Ding’s refining fire,\nHusband and wife at last unite in reverent union.\nThe River Chariot dares not pause even briefly,\nBut carries them to the summit of Kunlun’s peak.\n\nThe elixir is the wondrous treasure of the colored body,\nRefined, it transforms endlessly.\nIf one further investigates the true source of nature,\nThe wondrous function of non-arising is decisively realized.\n\nNo need to wait for future lives—\nBefore one’s eyes, the Buddha’s divine powers are attained.\nEver since the Dragon Girl achieved this work,\nWho since has been able to follow in her footsteps?\n\nAbbot Li, having also encountered the true and attained the Dao, left teachings that differ markedly from Ping Shu’s. Some say that Elder Li did not speak of the art of life, while Ping Shu did not speak of the school of nature. Yet nature and life are not two—this principle is perfectly clear. But it is difficult to express in words; only those of penetrating understanding may receive its transmission. Thus it is said: \"When someone comes seeking the Dao, you must transmit it to one of attainment.\" And again: \"It may be transmitted, but not imparted.\" Just as Yao transmitted the realm to Shun, and Shun to Yu, because Shun and Yu possessed mysterious virtue and sagely merit, so too is the transmission of the Dao. If it were said that the Dao could be transmitted to anyone, then the ancestral masters would not have left Mount Zhongnan, and all people would have attained accomplishment—why then would they have gone to such lengths in the eastern seas? After receiving the four true masters, the master then ranked his disciples and nephews in order: Dan Yang was his younger brother, Tan his nephew, and Chang Sheng and Chang Chun his sons. Later, when the four true masters attained the Dao, their progress varied in speed. Dan Yang took two and a half years, Chang Zhen five, Chang Sheng seven, and Chang Chun’s master eighteen or nineteen years, for his resolve and conduct penetrated Heaven and Earth, and only then did the sages grant it to him. Each was tested according to the depth of their accumulated merit and conduct, and thus their ranking and the speed of their attainment differed. Even the true masters were like this—how much more so for today’s learners, who do not accumulate merit and conduct yet wish to attain the Dao? There is no such principle. It is like a man wishing to buy goods worth a thousand gold pieces: he must first possess goods of equal value before he can obtain them. If he covets the goods but does not accumulate their price, he merely harbors deluded thoughts, and there is no principle by which he may attain them. The essential point of the Dao is nothing other than the accumulation of merit and virtue.\n\nWhen the ancestral master first arrived in Dengzhou, there was an official named Jie who was naturally inclined toward good deeds and always received him with great earnestness. Later, when Masters Ma and Tan passed through Dengzhou, Official Jie led a gathering to offer a vegetarian feast and requested to leave the household life. He thought that since the ancestral master had employed a thousand expedients to accept only two disciples—Ma and Tan—over two years, his own request would surely be welcomed. He pleaded repeatedly, but the master refused. On another day, he asked again, but the master still refused.",

      "translated_text": "Official Jie withdrew. The ancestral master addressed those present, saying: \"Consider two men who wish to build a great hall here. The first has already established the foundation and amassed abundant timber; though he has not yet sought craftsmen, craftsmen come to him of their own accord. Why? Because with materials prepared, the work can be accomplished. The second merely points to the ground where the foundation should be laid—yet the hollows remain unfilled, no labor has been expended, and when master builders see this, they turn away without a backward glance.\n\nIt is like a fertile field of one *mu*: when sown and tended in season, it yields grain by the *dan*. But a barren, meager field—no skilled farmer will work it, for it is but labor in vain, yielding nothing. From this, can one not see that without merit and practice as the foundation, how can the Dao be attained?\n\nIn the past, there was a certain Daoist Liu who ground grain in Guanzhong. He observed silence, begged for his meals as they came, and his resolve and conduct were most austere. Once, he went sixteen days without food yet dared not entertain a single stray thought, enduring this trial to its end. Later, after sixteen years, his master took pity on his bitter discipline, yet his nature remained unruly—any slight provocation would rouse him to fiery rage. When I resided at Yuqing Abbey, he came to request lodging. After returning to his hometown, he passed through twice in two years, and I gradually saw his demeanor worsen, his words grow erratic. Though he was nearly sixty, I later heard he had returned to lay life. There is no other reason for this: from the outset, he did not take merit and practice as his foundation, and so it was bound to end thus.\n\nThose who once begged for alms and sat in meditation did so because their minds had glimpsed awakening, though not yet with perfect unity. Thus they dwelled in stillness to nurture and investigate true emptiness. But those who beg and sit in meditation today are mostly young and without understanding, their minds hollow and void, often falling into delusion and falsehood. How lamentable!\n\nNow the gate of the teaching stands wide open, and every action is an act of merit and practice. With earnestness and humility, severing the distinctions of self and other, suffering for oneself to benefit others—this is the very nature of the Dao. Persevere without cease, and in time, awakening will come of itself.\n\nYet today, when people see another performing good deeds, they say, 'There is the heart of the Dao.' When they see unwholesome conduct, they say, 'There is no heart of the Dao.' If one reasons thus, can they truly be said to know the Dao? Let none among you doubt this.\n\nOnce, while traveling in Beishan, I sought lodging for the night at Tongxian Abbey in Zhenxian Camp, where I sat with the assembly. Li Zhishao recited an old lyric containing the line: *The celestial origin of jiazi has arrived.* When the song ended, I jested, saying: 'For us Daoists, the celestial origin of *jiazi* has already passed.' The others did not understand. I explained: 'This was something Master Changsheng often said. I once heard him say: *Cultivation must accord with the time—this is precisely the season of the celestial origin of jiazi, a time of great celebration. Once this time has passed, cultivation will become far more difficult.* At first, I did not fully believe it, for I had not yet understood deeply. But now, having entered the Dao for many years, I recognize the profound truth of timing.\n\nI have observed that in the early years of Master Changsheng’s leadership, those who cultivated would dwell in stillness and apply themselves, and before long, signs would arise in their minds—such cases were too numerous to count. But in his later years, none were seen to attain realization. Why? Because the time was no longer right.\"",

      "translated_text": "Just as one who sows seeds in the midwinter moon expends twice the usual labor yet reaps nothing, so too do all worldly affairs wax and wane with the times—who can defy this? My master often said that the Confucians’ discourse on the Dao is fully expounded in the *Analects* and *Mencius*. In my youth, I read these books and savored their flavor; later, when I entered the Dao, I grasped their principle.\n\nConfucius said to Yan Yuan: *\"When employed, act; when set aside, withdraw—only you and I possess this.\"* The sage did not favor Yanzi alone; the others simply could not fathom this principle. What is this principle? It is nothing other than *timing*. When one may advance, advance; when one may retreat, retreat; when one may abide long, abide long; when one may hasten, hasten. There is no absolute \"can\" or \"cannot\"—in movement and stillness, there is no self, only following the time. Thus, in movement and stillness, there is nothing that is not the Dao. Hence, Mencius praised Confucius, saying: *\"He was orderly in all things, the great synthesizer, the sage who acted according to the time.\"* Whether advancing or retreating, whether acting or non-acting, his Dao was one. Thus, Mencius said: *\"Yu, Ji, and Yan Yuan shared the same Dao; had their places been exchanged, they would have done the same.\"*\n\nIn my youth, I once asked my master: *\"The merits and virtues of Yao and Shun were towering, governing the world with reverent effort—this was acting. Xu You declined Yao’s abdication, having no desire for the world—this was non-acting. Why are both called sages?\"* My master replied: *\"Acting and non-acting are one and the same; in the Dao, they are identical. For the cultivator, wholly abandoning worldly affairs to focus the mind on inner work is non-acting; attending to circumstances and accumulating merit and conduct is acting. Focusing the mind on inner work is superior, but next to that, nothing surpasses accumulating merit and deeds—both emerge from the same Dao. Those who fail to understand this cannot grasp the great unity. Thus, each clings to one side, debating right and wrong, unaware that movement and stillness are mutually the substance and function of one another. Not only are movement and stillness one—yin and yang, day and night, life and death, the manifest and the hidden are all fundamentally the same. One who knows the Dao of life also knows death. One who fully comprehends the principle of the manifest also comprehends the hidden. What doubt remains?\"*\n\nWhen Zilu asked about serving ghosts and spirits, Confucius said: *\"If you cannot serve men, how can you serve ghosts?\"* When asked about death, he replied: *\"If you do not know life, how can you know death?\"* Zilu should have grasped this profound principle in the Master’s words, yet such understanding is reserved for the perceptive. This is why my master, whenever he encountered a perceptive person, would encourage and guide them, never lightly abandoning them. For instance, Master Danyang’s disciple Sun Penglai was keen and intelligent from childhood; as he grew, there was nothing he did not master, excelling even in literature and medicine. With such insight, attaining the Dao would not have been difficult. He often lived in seclusion, and my master deeply regretted this, wishing to keep him close, but Sun refused to comply.\n\nPerceptive people may indeed attain the Dao, yet their emotions are often stirred by external influences, making it difficult to maintain purity and stillness. As Du Zimei’s poem says: *\"In the dead of night, I rise and sit, assailed by ten thousand feelings.\"* Thus, one sees how the perceptive are prone to such afflictions. Generally, the perceptive are endowed by Heaven with spirit, and even in death, they remain close to the divine. Yet if their emotions and desires are not eradicated, they will inevitably drift and transmigrate. If, however, they employ their perceptive gifts to diligently practice the Dao, mastering human desires and attaining pure unity without interruption—like an infant or a newborn babe—they will reach the realm of true immortality. Human nature is fundamentally thus; all else is but emotion and desire.\n\nHence, the various masters debated human nature: some claimed it was evil, others that it was a mix of good and evil, while only Mencius asserted its goodness. This is why he stands below the sages yet above all other masters. Only the perceptive can understand and practice this teaching. Is human perceptiveness without cause? In truth, it arises from the accumulation of merit and conduct over many lives, which becomes one’s good fortune. Nurtured by this fortune, one’s nature naturally awakens, and thus Heaven endows one with perceptiveness. How could there be perceptiveness without cause?\n\nToday, the gate of the teaching stands wide open—this is precisely the time to accumulate merit and conduct, to act as the foundation for entering the Dao. Yet some hear but do not believe, believe but do not act, idling away their time, exploiting others, and few among them avoid falling into decline. Alas!\n\nMy master said: *\"Among learners, those who are widely informed and knowledgeable often overthink, weighing gains and losses heavily—this is why their faith wavers. Others, knowing nothing, neither seek advantage nor avoid harm, their minds single-mindedly devoted. Though they may appear foolish and dull, they draw near to the Dao. Generally, those overly concerned with gains and losses lack purity; without purity, there is no sincerity; without sincerity, how can one enter the Dao?\"*\n\nMy master also said: *\"Whenever I speak plainly to others, they take it as commonplace and do not strive earnestly. Many believe that only those who communicate with spirits or attain sagehood are truly on the Dao.\"* I recall someone once urging my master to display his abilities more, so as to gain the world’s trust and esteem. My master paid no heed; when pressed repeatedly, the advisor grew more insistent. My master laughed heartily and said: *\"I spent fifty years learning the word ‘sincerity’—I will not cast it aside in a single day.\"*\n\nThus, the perfected do not perform deeds to astonish the world. Like a worldly person who hoards wealth, even in haste or peril, they do not lightly part with it. Therefore, the perfected appear as if they have nothing, their fullness as emptiness; they do not reveal even the slightest hint, even feigning madness to blend with the world, fearing that others might recognize them. If others do recognize them and show reverence, it harms their own cultivation. Thus, when Chan Master Zhou resolved the fight between tigers, he lost his third fruit—all these are truths of sincerity.",
      "overlap_context": "first, I did not fully believe it, for I had not yet understood deeply. But now, having entered the Dao for many years, I recognize the profound truth of timing.\n\nI have observed that in the early years of Master Changsheng’s leadership, those who cultivated would dwell in stillness and apply themselves, and before long, signs would arise in their minds—such cases were too numerous to count. But in his later years, none were seen to attain realization. Why? Because the time was no longer right.\"",

      "translated_text": "Yet people invariably assume that only those who display wondrous spiritual powers are aligned with the Dao—unaware that such attainment must first arise from the accumulation of merit and conduct. When these have grown deep and substantial, the heart naturally becomes numinous, and external circumstances naturally respond, all of which is self-realized. If one harbors intent in seeking, it inevitably leads to falsity, and the harm to one’s nature and fortune is beyond measure.\n\n*Record of the Northern Journey of Master Qinghe, Scroll One – Concluded*\n*Record of the Northern Journey of Master Qinghe, Scroll Two*\nCompiled by Disciple Duan Zhijian\n\nOn the Mid-Autumn night, we sat in the open air at Qizhen Abbey. The conversation turned to the Sacred Spring of Fan Mountain, said to be the birthplace of the Yellow Emperor. Beside the spring stood a tree upon which the Emperor’s mother once spread her garments to dry. The tree then bent and twisted, its branches and leaves shading the spring, as if not by mere chance. The elders say that when the tree grew old, a new shoot sprouted beneath it. As it matured, its branches and form mirrored the original, and so it has continued for generations unknown.\n\nSomeone asked: *\"Given such marvels, why has there been no grand construction to honor and propagate them?\"*\nThe Master replied: *\"I once saw a small stele there. Upon reading it, I learned that a Tang dynasty magistrate had donated his own salary to erect it. After the Song dynasty came to power, this region fell under Khitan rule, and so no further efforts were made. For wherever there is grand flourishing, there must also be grand decay. Only the ordinary endures—this is the inherent principle of all things.*\n\nFrom the Emperor’s time to the present spans over thirty-six hundred years, through countless rises and falls of dynasties. Yet the sacred site remains, revered across a hundred generations—all because it has endured in its ordinariness. My master, well-read and deeply versed in principle, understood that the Emperor’s virtue was ever praised among the people. Yet most do not fathom such truths and dismiss them as mere fables, few being those who truly listen and believe.\n\nIt is said the Emperor was not exiled but descended of his own accord, for when Heaven deliberated great deeds, it was deemed that nothing more could be accomplished above, and so he wished to act upon the earth below. In his first life as a commoner, he did all within his power to benefit the world. In his second life as an official, his works brought relief to the multitudes. In his third life as Emperor, he bequeathed enduring benefits to ten thousand generations. Thus do we know that celestial beings must bestow merit upon the world, ensuring that the people draw from it without exhaustion, before they may ascend once more and dwell in their rightful place above.\n\nAbbot Zhang of the Abbey asked: *\"It is said that the Emperor’s ancestors spanned five eras, each marked by sagely virtue, and that the people lived for ten thousand years. Is this credible?\"*\nThe Master replied: *\"Without written records to verify, it may seem fantastical. Yet by principle, it is entirely plausible. When humans first receive the qi of the Dao to come into being, they necessarily follow its waxing and waning. At the dawn of heaven and earth, when the qi of the Dao was pure and unadulterated, those born were like infants in nature, all attuned to its essence—how could their lifespans have been limited to ten thousand years? As the qi of the Dao gradually receded, the earth produced lingzhi mushrooms, and those who ate them still lived for a thousand years. When the qi of the Dao further dispersed, the hundred grains arose. People selected the finest to eat, savoring their flavors, and thus desires were born—no wonder their lifespans fell short of a hundred. By principle, this cannot be called a falsehood.\"*\n\nIn my youth, I read the Buddhist *Lotus Sutra*, which spoke of the sun’s size, the moon’s size, the nine heavens, the nine earthly layers, each with their respective heights and depths. At first, I dismissed it as absurd. Later, upon entering the Dao, I grasped its meaning. The nine heavens, for instance, are the realm of emptiness. Since emptiness is paired with fullness, the nine earthly layers follow as a matter of course. Just as the earth yields gold, silver, copper, and iron, what we see as metals are merely the qi of the Five Phases concentrated within, manifesting externally as form and substance—moving from non-being into being. Though they may seem hard and enduring, in time they must return to their origin.\n\nOnce, a guest remarked on the fashion of adorning garments with gold, calculating that the daily cost amounted to no less than several hundred *qian*. Who would have thought that even solid gold could decay? From this, I understood that most people remain ignorant of the Way of Heaven. The Way of Heaven inevitably returns—not by deliberate intent, but by its own nature. This is principle. Gold emerges from the earth, yet it never sought to be used by the world. It is humans who, through cunning, extract it without end, thereby wounding the primordial qi. Though its form may decay, its qi returns to its origin. Were it otherwise, the Way of generation would cease.\n\nThis principle of generation applies not only to metal, water, fire, earth, and wood, but to all things. Once, while traveling with my master north of Yin Mountain, we came upon a great forest in the desert. Though untouched by axes, the trees—regardless of size—had all withered. Their root-qi had simply waned, leaving no choice but to decay. Yet beneath them, new shoots had already sprouted—this is the Way of generation. From this, we see that flourishing and decay, life and death, are all natural. Human fortunes—wealth and poverty, honor and disgrace, longevity and early death—are likewise determined by fate. Only when people refuse to accept their lot do they exhaust their minds and bodies in ceaseless striving. Yet in the end, they cannot add even a fraction to their allotted portion. If their intentions stray from rectitude and accumulate into transgressions, the harm they incur is beyond imagination—not only do they gain nothing, but they bring ruin upon themselves. Thus it is said: *\"The Dao is without intent.\"*\n\nAs the world declines and the people fail to comprehend this principle, Heaven sends forth great sages and worthies to save them. Through teachings and personal example, they illuminate the Three Principles, guiding all to restore their original nature. This is the very purpose of the ancestral masters’ teachings.\n\nThe Master said: *\"When people suffer deception, humiliation, or even murder without cause, it is always in repayment of past debts. Only the enlightened, who understand principle, dare not deceive even a single thought, nor slight even a single thing.\"*",

      "translated_text": "A single word or deed must be weighed with utmost care, lest one wrong any being—better that others wrong oneself than that one wrong another. To deceive others is to deceive oneself; to harm others is to harm oneself, like turning a blade upon one’s own body.\n\nOnce, as the Master sat with his disciples discussing how worldly people often exploit those below to curry favor with those above, seeking only their own security, he said: *\"How deluded they are! To take from the many yet secure their trust is to find true security without seeking it. But if one seeks only personal safety while neglecting the many, one only invites peril—such is the failure to grasp the Way of loss and gain.\"* Thus it is said: *\"What is diminished may yet increase; what is increased may yet diminish.\"* This is not a truth the common world can comprehend.\n\nOn the seventeenth night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, the assembly of Qizhen Abbey sat beneath the open sky. The sculptor Wang Cai made obeisance and entreated the Master to instruct him in the method of crafting Daoist images. The Master replied: *\"Of all images, none is harder to fashion than that of the Daoist adept. Not only is the sculpting difficult, but even the discourse upon it is arduous. One must first master the rituals and protocols of the teachings, as well as the principles of iconographic representation, before one can speak of the Daoist image.*\n\n*The Great Dao of emptiness and quiescence cannot be seen or heard. Though sound and form lie before us, it is not that we truly do not see or hear—rather, we do not exhaust our perception in external things, for within, something is preserved. To claim we truly do not see or hear would reduce us to dead matter. Yet if nothing is preserved within and all perception is given over to externals, we are merely led by things. The challenge of the Daoist image lies in revealing outward sight and hearing while conveying the intent of inner contemplation—this is why it is so difficult.*\n\n*Even the most wealthy and noble of worldly figures have images that are easily captured. The rich and powerful, for instance, are often depicted with flushed complexions, heavy flesh, and full jowls, verging on the gross and turbid. But the Daoist image must retain its ethereal refinement and transcendent bearing, exuding the aura of a great noble—visible in the brows and eyes, in the celestial expanse of the forehead, and in the moonlit angles of the temples. The back should resemble a vessel of ten thousand *hu*, symbolizing profound depth and gravity. Only by grasping these essentials can one approximate the true likeness.*\n\n*Yet even then, one must convey the intent without allowing sharp edges to protrude—this is what makes it even harder. The riches and honors of the world, even those of emperors, can still be sought through conventional methods. But the Daoist image must be sought beyond technique. In external appearance, one may exhaust all subtleties, but when it comes to the inner aspect, technique alone cannot suffice. Yet what is within must manifest without, becoming visible in one’s conduct. Conduct is the trace; the principle behind conduct is the truth. By examining the trace, the truth may be known—thus inner and outer become one.*\n\n*The Daoist adept values discretion and concealment, so that others may never truly see them. As Liezi lived in the gardens of Zheng for forty years, yet no one recognized him. The ancestral masters and their successive perfected disciples, having opened the gate of the teachings, revealed hidden mysteries and expounded profound wonders in every place and time.*\n\n*The Master once said: 'The ancients attained enlightenment but lacked the encounter; the people of today have the encounter but lack enlightenment. In ancient times, many of noble aspiration and lofty conduct, embracing simplicity and preserving truth, never met a perfected one to guide them and thus spent their lives in obscurity. Today, though people are fortunate to encounter perfected ones who widely open the gate of the teachings, some still fail to awaken—how lamentable!'*\n\n*An ancient saying goes: 'Once in a thousand years a sage appears; once in five hundred years a worthy emerges.' This speaks to the rarity of their coming. Yet who can say that the ancestral masters and their successive perfected disciples did not all appear in this world? Though the perfected masters of today may not be visible, their transmitted teachings remain intact. People dismiss them as crude or simplistic, paying them no heed, unaware that their words are plain yet their meaning profound.*\n\n*Scholars may judge these teachings by the standards of literary composition and find them wanting in form. But the perfected ones aim to clarify the Dao and care little for the rules of writing. Though the Venerable Master of Longevity did not study books, his compositions flowed naturally from his heart and mind—such as his one hundred and twenty *Ruizhegu* poems and sixty *Feng Rusong* verses, all composed extemporaneously. His commentaries on the Three Teachings were written without pause, their words spare but their principles abundant. Those who understand recognize them as the very model of immortals’ discourse. Though he did not study literature, he grasped its essence—for principle is the Dao itself.*\n\n*In all things, whether the literary arts of scholars or the crafts of artisans, the subtleties emerge from the Dao. Yet people go about their days without realizing it. All things arise from emptiness. Pointing to the temple hall, the Master said: 'Even this hall, with its sculptures and paintings, is but a phantasm born of human nature; human nature itself is a phantasm born of the Dao. Is not its wondrous function the Dao itself? Though heaven and earth are vast and the myriad things are many, they too arise from emptiness.'*\n\n*The Supreme Ultimate generates the Two Modes; the Two Modes generate the Four Images; the Four Images generate the Eight Trigrams. Through mutual interaction and transformation, their changes are inexhaustible. The classic says: 'The Dao generates the One; the One generates the Two; the One generates the Three; the Three generate the myriad things.' It also says: 'Though the things of the world flourish, each returns to its root. Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called the restoration of life.' This is the ultimate subtlety of the Dao.*\n\n*Born of the Dao, if one can return to the Dao, one does not lose one’s original nature. The sages and worthies have left behind a thousand scriptures and ten thousand treatises—yet they never spoke of soaring transformations or ascending to heaven in broad daylight. Their sole aim was that people not lose their original nature. Life and death, coming and going, are clearly determined by oneself. If one cannot conduct oneself properly in the world, one loses the Way. A single loss leads to endless deviations, and one may wander through the six paths of rebirth and the four modes of existence.*\n\n*After attaining the Dao, Master Hao of the Great Antiquity once asked his disciples: 'Which teaching is most essential to the Dao?' One replied: 'That of non-coming and non-going.' The Master smiled and said: 'This is but the teaching itself—coming and going must be clearly understood!'*",

      "translated_text": "When the Master resided in Jiaoxi, he once posed this question to his assembly, and one from the mountain before him responded with what his own heart had realized. Later, in the desert, he again asked this of the assembly. I replied: \"Respond to thoughts as they arise, moment by moment, with no obstruction—this has its own root and source.\" The Master approved of this.\n\nWho among men is without thought? The key is to discern whether thoughts are upright or perverse; what must be discarded are the perverse ones. Whatever harms essence, spirit, or qi is perverse. Many learners, not understanding this, cling to the idea that thoughts must be eradicated entirely. Yet if one follows principle in action, accumulating merit and cultivating conduct through upright thoughts, would one then eradicate these as well? To do so would reduce one to a dead thing—how could this accord with the Dao?\n\nIt is like a man sitting in a bare room, daring not to engage with anything, daring not to stir a single thought, hoping to preserve and await the Dao. But does he know whether the Dao can truly be preserved and awaited—or not? I would take heaven and earth as my bare room, roaming freely within them, engaging with things in their midst, with ample room to spare, and never feel it hinders the Dao.\n\nThere is a saying:\n*Who is without thought? Who is without life?*\n*If truly without life, then nothing is not alive.*\n\nAnother verse:\n*Clouds drift away, clouds drift in—the sky remains still.*\n*Flowers bloom, flowers fade—the tree stays at ease.*\n\nPointing to the moon, he said: \"This thing does nothing, yet beneath the azure heavens, floating clouds may obscure it. When they part, its empty brightness penetrates all, illuminating everything—all can see it. Yet people do not realize that each person possesses this moon of the heart. Only when floating clouds obscure it does its light fade. All selfish desires and perverse thoughts are these floating clouds. If one can constantly prevent perverse thoughts from arising, the moon of the heart will shine as brightly as the moon in the sky, enduring with heaven and earth, never again obscured.\"\n\nThe Master said: \"In former times, those who cultivated the Way examined every thought in every dust-mote and instant. If they detected a single evil thought, they would confess it to others, bringing upon themselves shame and humiliation, hoping it would never again arise in their hearts. Today’s learners are the opposite: if they perform even a minor good deed, they boast and flaunt it, fearing others will not know. Yet they conceal and excuse a thousand evils, fearing others will discover them. How can they ever truly do good?\"\n\nWhen the Master was at leisure, his disciples sat beside him. He invited them to sit, and they exchanged bows for a long time without settling. The Master said: \"In ritual propriety, what matters most is sincerity and naturalness. If one harbors no competitive intent yet happens to be in a superior position, what harm is there? In private, one need not defer excessively—too much deference borders on pretense. Yet ritual is founded on reverence; if not tempered by righteousness, it cannot be practiced. To conduct oneself with reverence and act with righteousness—this is the mark of a noble person. Reverence is constancy; righteousness is adaptation. To know constancy but not adaptation is to cling to one extreme. Clinging to one extreme is to lack understanding.\n\nThe four seasons of heaven—warmth, chill, cold, heat—wind, rain, thunder, and lightning—are all transformations. They change in response to stimuli, even spirits and gods cannot predict them. Human affairs are no different. Not only in ritual, but in every word and deed, one must not act rashly. Respond to situations as they arise, ensuring each action is fitting. Do not dismiss this as a trivial matter and fail to apply your heart—this is where the Dao is found.\n\nIn the past, when the Master of Danyang first established the teachings, he took rejecting extravagance and embracing frugality—going against worldly ways—as the great constant. Whatever the world desired, he would not pursue. Only because people are endlessly consumed by craving, becoming deluded and losing their true nature, unable to recover it, did he set the precept: no more than three companions on the Way, no more than three rooms in a thatched hut. Even when building an ancestral hall, he limited it to three rooms. The site was quite elevated and open, and his disciples requested to ascend and look out, but he would not permit it. He said: 'I have not exerted effort here—why would I indulge in climbing and gazing, which are worldly desires? Those who cultivate the real do not do such things.'\n\nThe scripture says:\n*As in spring, one ascends a terrace.*\nIt speaks of the heart’s delight. Looking down at the flourishing spring scenery, the mind is at ease. When the mind is at ease, emotions arise. When scenery and emotion meet, one drifts into attachment, gradually losing the way back. Moreover, wandering in scenic places truly depletes one’s good fortune.\n\nI recall when the Master first entered the Changchun Palace and ascended the Baoxuan Hall, he saw the ornate beams and rafters, the fresh furnishings, and stood gazing for a long time before departing. The assembly invited him to sit, but he refused. There was no other reason—he, too, feared it would deplete his good fortune.\"",

A single loss leads to endless deviations, and one may wander through the six paths of rebirth and the four modes of existence.*\n\n*After attaining the Dao, Master Hao of the Great Antiquity once asked his disciples: 'Which teaching is most essential to the Dao?' One replied: 'That of non-coming and non-going.' The Master smiled and said: 'This is but the teaching itself—coming and going must be clearly understood!'*",

      "translated_text": "At that time, someone, knowing it was improper, deliberately urged me to sit, and I complied. There are matters one cannot avoid—though I initially had no intention of doing so, others, with clever persuasion, induced me to act. If I had merely gone along, what harm would there have been? After all, I had no prior intent. Yet if one harbors hidden motives while outwardly refusing to comply, how can one escape fault?\n\nThe Master said: When the Patriarch resided on Kunjian Mountain, my master Changchun had followed him for three years, at the age of twenty-three. The Patriarch, recognizing Master Danyang’s vast merit and conduct from past lives, often discussed profound mysteries with him. But since Changchun’s merit had not yet reached that level, he was made to perform mundane labor without a moment’s rest. One day, the Patriarch closed the door to discuss breath-regulation methods with Danyang. My master eavesdropped outside, and after a while, pushed the door open and entered, halting their discussion.\n\nMy master reflected inwardly: if breath-regulation is so wondrous, then the labor I perform is precisely its opposite. From then on, whenever he had spare time, he diligently practiced what he had overheard. Later, when the Patriarch was about to depart, over those three years, he subjected the four disciples to rigorous training—one day’s work equaled what would have taken a hundred or a thousand days before. Their actions were reversed, their conduct disordered, every movement and word met with scolding and reproach.\n\nMy master thought to himself: Since following the Patriarch, I have not understood what the Dao truly is. Everything he has taught me seems irrelevant to the matter at hand. I wished to ask him, but feared the Patriarch’s severity. I considered going along with his instructions, yet my longing for the Dao was too urgent. My mind could not settle, and I grew increasingly frustrated. One day, seizing an opportunity, I asked him.\n\nThe Patriarch replied: It lies within your nature.\nHe said nothing more, and my master dared not ask again.\n\nLater, just before the Patriarch’s departure, during the twelfth lunar month, the four disciples were instructed to procure money and buy large quantities of firewood and charcoal, which were then burned in the small chamber where he slept. The room was so cramped that Danyang and Changzhen were made to stand inside, unable to endure the heat, while Changsheng and Changchun stood outside, unable to bear the cold. Those inside dared not step out, and those outside dared not enter. This continued for a long time, until Master Changsheng, unable to endure the suffering, fled.\n\nOn the fourth day of the first lunar month, as the Patriarch was about to ascend, the three remaining disciples stood beneath the trees. The Patriarch said: Danyang has attained the Dao, Changzhen has understood it, and I have no concerns about them. But Changsheng and Changchun have not yet done so. Changchun’s learning shall henceforth be guided entirely by Danyang’s command, and Changzhen shall oversee Changsheng.\n\nThen, turning to Changchun, he said: You bear a great fault that must be eradicated. You once thought that everything I taught you was irrelevant. You did not realize that the very irrelevance is the Dao.\n\nMy master later recounted these words. At first, I found them tasteless, but upon reflection, they proved to be the highest truth. All worldly affairs are entangled in the realm of attachment; only in their absence lies the Dao. Yet most people cannot escape this realm of attachment and thus often fall into evil. For in the world, good and evil are evenly matched—since there is one yin and one yang, this cannot be otherwise. It depends entirely on what one chooses.\n\nIf one consistently practices goodness, evil gradually recedes, and one may reach a state of pure goodness where evil thoughts no longer arise. But if one indulges in evil without repentance, evil becomes habitual, and even good thoughts cannot take root.\n\nAfter the ritual at Qizhen Abbey concluded, the Master sat in silent meditation for a long time. The assembly rose and bowed, entreating him to teach. The Master said: Do not think I am withholding anything. I do not speak because there is no one to receive it. To speak without being heard, or to be heard without being practiced, is of no benefit to either side—why should I speak?\n\nI recall when I was in Binzhou, I was suddenly stricken with wind-illness. I thought to myself: In this life, I have been fortunate to meet true masters, and all the profound and subtle teachings I have received were transmitted orally, heart to heart. I vowed to pass them on to later generations. If I were to perish from this illness, it would fail to fulfill the intent of the masters’ transmission. Moreover, today I have inherited the leadership of the teaching—how could I conceal anything?\n\nSince the time of the Patriarch, the teachings have flourished as they have. The reason people from all directions trust me is that they believe I have personally served the Perfected and must have received their transmission. How could I not wish to speak of the Perfected’s Dao?\n\nI remember when I followed my master on the northern journey from Weizhou during a time of hardship. Many devotees accompanied us for over half a month, hoping to hear a single word, but they could not. One day, Elder Xiao, through Master Da, begged my master to respond to the assembly’s wishes. My master said: Have I ever failed to respond? I am like a bell—wherever it is struck, it answers. If struck with great force, its sound can fill heaven and earth without difficulty. This I heard with my own ears.\n\nI was born in the ninth year of the Dading era, and the Patriarch ascended in the tenth year, so I did not have the chance to serve him directly. But I served all the subsequent masters. Master Taigu personally expounded the *Book of Changes* to me—teachings unheard of in the world. Master Yuyang held my hand and discoursed on the wonders of the Dao. The instructions from Master Changchun are too numerous to recount.\n\nNow, at nearly seventy years of age, my time of return approaches—how could I not wish to pass on what I have received? All my words are grounded in truth, but people often prefer the strange and marvelous, so those who hear them do not take them to heart.\n\nChen Xiuyu was utterly convinced by my master. He once told others: The reason I am so devoted to Qiu Changchun is simply because of his truthfulness. When we discussed the teachings, he said: Daoism and Buddhism employ expedient means, but Confucianism does not. Only someone deeply versed in principle could make such a statement. For the teachings of Daoism and Buddhism use skillful means to transform people, designed for those of middling or lesser capacity—this is the expedient of the sages.",

      "translated_text": "Confucius once said: \"Those above the median may be spoken to of higher things, while those below the median cannot.\" Thus, the sages condescend to employ expedient means, gently guiding them to make entry easy—yet the ultimate goodness is one and the same. Does the heart of the sage differ from others? All aim for goodness alone.\n\nNow, I speak truthfully to all of you. What you hear is not my private word, but the teaching of the Perfected. When people first set their minds on learning the Dao and embracing goodness, none fail to advance with vigor. Yet before long, they grow lax, for they harbor vain desires and, seeing no verification, fall into doubt they cannot resolve—thus abandoning the Way mid-course.\n\nThe sages established their teachings for all under heaven and for posterity, wishing only that people cast off delusion and return to their nature, preventing the passions and desires from disturbing the center, so that the heart may rest in its ordinary state—this is the foundation of entering the Dao. Do the sages alone lack passions? They merely keep their hearts unmoved. Just as heaven has its four seasons, with cold and heat in alternation, thunder, wind, and rain transforming all before them, yet the true substance of the Great Void never stirs. When the learner investigates and attains this, they reach the state of ordinariness. Hence the saying: \"Ordinariness is the Dao.\"\n\nFirst preserve this ordinariness. The accumulation of conduct and merit depends entirely on oneself—this lies within one’s power. The manifestation of the Dao, the grasp of sages and worthies, lies with Heaven. One must fulfill what lies within one’s power and leave what lies with Heaven. When merit and conduct are complete, the Dao is naturally attained. To seek it with intent is delusion.\n\nOnce, when traveling with my master to Xianzhou, a magistrate never left his side for a single day. Seizing an opportunity, he asked: \"I have devoted myself to the Dao in seclusion for fifteen years. People call me pure and tranquil, yet I know myself that I have not attained it.\" My master smiled but did not answer. After a long while, he said: \"Purity and tranquility are not one. There is inner and outer, non-action and action. What you practice is outer—it is action. To have one son and one daughter is the common course of the world. Even what you do is not easily achieved, yet it is not true purity and tranquility. Non-action with self-attainment—this is true purity and tranquility, what the sages and worthies attain.\"\n\nSome learners today engage in visualization and breath regulation as their practice. Though good, they never see success. It is like forcing flowers to bloom in winter beneath a shelter—though marvelous, they never bear fruit. Only non-action and purity are the ultimate attainment, verified by the absence of leakage. After three years without leakage, the lower elixir forms. After six years, the middle elixir forms—matters already beyond full description. After nine years, the upper elixir forms, ascending into the Mud Pill Palace. The Three Palaces rise and descend, transformations endless. Even a thousand or ten thousand emanation bodies emerge from this. How can one achieve this? By ensuring the heart-ground is ordinary.\n\nFor when the heart is ordinary, the spirit is settled; when the spirit is settled, essence congeals; when essence congeals, qi harmonizes. This manifests in the face and radiates through the four limbs—all naturally. The foundation is the heart-ground’s ordinariness. What lies within one’s power must be fully realized; what depends on Heaven cannot be forced. Only when merit and conduct are complete will there be self-attainment.\n\nMaster Changchun often said that among today’s teaching lineage, those who advance in the Dao with utmost sincerity are all bound by karmic encounters from past lives—true masters like Zhengyang and Chunyang have forged deep connections. If people today understand this principle and ceaselessly accumulate virtue, their advancement cannot be measured. It is like the officials of the court, each ranked in order. Their demotion or promotion is determined by merit and fault. As cultivators, they stand a grade above ordinary people. Like officials of the nine ranks, if they have merit without fault, their advancement is unceasing, and the highest rank may be expected. Yet learners, ignorant of this, neglect solid merit and seek only the honor of the highest rank. How could this be possible?\n\nObserve the Perfected who attained the Dao—their levels differ, all according to the depth of their accumulated merit and conduct. Master Danyang attained the Dao in two and a half years, Changzhen in five, Changsheng in seven. Master Changchun spent nearly twenty years at Panxi and Longmen, his will and qi penetrating heaven and earth, his actions resonating with sages and worthies. The Dao acknowledged him, yet later, his progress vanished without trace. His resolve grew only firmer, yet after attaining it, it was soon taken away—because his merit and conduct were not yet complete. If even the Perfected face this, how much more so others? Learners should only advance in merit and conduct, without seeking verification or harboring doubt. When practice is complete, awakening will come naturally.\n\nThose with exceptional natural intelligence far surpassing the ordinary are not the result of a single lifetime. Their accumulation must have been gradual. At three, I remembered all I saw and heard, never forgetting. At five, I entered school and, within three winter months, could recite the *Classic of Filial Piety* and the *Analects*. Even if I memorized over a thousand words a day, I still had energy to spare. My grandfather was versed in the study of yin and yang. When I sought to learn it, he refused, saying: \"You must first memorize the sixty-year cycle in a single day.\" I pleaded insistently, and after noon, he taught me.

The rites concluded before sunrise, and after dispersing, all indulged in feasting, merriment, and play, each following their own desires.\n\nI alone felt a stirring within. Privately, I pondered: our ancestors stretch into the distant past, yet where have they gone? Mortals face death, yet where do they return? My heart grew desolate. Seated beneath a great mulberry tree, I gazed upward and downward, contemplating how heaven and earth endure, how the myriad things arise. Above the heavens and below the earth—what covers and sustains them? What upholds and maintains all? My thoughts probed so deeply that they dissolved into thoughtlessness, and I forgot the vastness of heaven and earth, the multitude of things. All I perceived was a boundless expanse of misty qi, connecting above and below like the shell of an egg, dark and indistinct.

      "translated_text": "At first, I resided in a hut west of Changyi County. Often, I would sit alone beneath a peach tree, and sometimes, lost in meditation, I would remain unaware until past midnight, oblivious to the break of dawn.\n\nOne night, during the fourth watch, a figure suddenly appeared—his bearing that of an immortal, his spirit untouched by the mundane world, his presence radiant with golden light and jade-like luster. At first sight, I composed my heart and remained unmoved, knowing him to be a True Person of Lifelong Cultivation. He approached and swung a blade to sever my head, yet my heart did not waver. Pleased, he restored it. Upon awakening, I realized with clarity that the master had transformed my worldly visage.\n\nTen days later, he returned and cut open my chest to remove my heart, and I understood he had taken away my worldly mind. Another ten days passed, and he arrived again, bearing a plate of scorching oil, which he offered to me. I consumed it all, feeling so overfull I nearly died, whereupon he split open my abdomen and cleared it entirely. This was because my nature had long been prideful—pride invites harm and setbacks, so he removed what would bring me ruin.\n\nAlas! Sincerity moves the divine; this is no empty truth. If one wholeheartedly practices the Dao, the distance between oneself and the sages is not far. I had never spoken of this to anyone, but now I reveal it fully to all. Let none dismiss these words as mere emptiness and fail to act upon them.\n\nOne night at Kaiyuan Abbey in Jianzhou, as the assembly discussed the rise and fall of human affairs, the master said: *\"To observe the Dao of Heaven and grasp its workings is to comprehend all.\"* Yet people fail to examine the subtleties of Heaven’s Dao—how then can they grasp and enact it?\n\nThe Dao of Heaven is profoundly mysterious. Consider but a few examples: though we say a day consists of one hundred *ke*, this is merely a general statement, for in truth, the count never quite reaches a hundred. Again, the ten Celestial Stems pair with the twelve Earthly Branches, their interplay generating endless transformations. Were a day truly a full hundred *ke* with stems and branches in perfect alignment, all would be fixed and unchanging. Precisely because of its capacity for change, the myriad beings arise ceaselessly without exhaustion.\n\nEvery single thing, every plant, though formed by the transformation of a single *qi*, experiences growth and decline, all tied to the flow of time. Take the five grains and the hundred grasses—countless in variety—when one species aligns with the season’s favor, its vitality surpasses all others. Such is the work of time. Thus it is said: *\"The ten thousand transformations emerge in accord with the hour.\"*\n\nIf even insentient things follow this principle, how much more so for humans, who partake of Heaven and Earth’s spirit? Just as the patterns of things have their flourishing and decay, so too do human affairs rise and fall. From the state down to every household, none are exempt. Consider the teachings from the West, which have entered China for over a thousand years—without the right time, how could this have come to pass? Yet what arises with the times must also fade with them. Though the rise and fall of all things depend on Heaven, Heaven’s true constancy never alters in the slightest. Why? Because it is without intent.",

      "translated_text": "If one fails to comprehend this principle, joy and sorrow arise without reason, and one is swept along by external things, losing one’s true nature and unable to recover it. Thus the enlightened person remains without intent, allowing the ten thousand changes to unfold before them without disturbance, for they know that their nature originally issues from Heaven and shares the same body with it. Therefore, all their actions follow the pattern of Heaven. Only when a student of the Dao reaches this point may they begin to enter the Way.\n\nAt Chuanzhou Jade Void Abbey, the Daoist community and faithful devotees served their master with tireless diligence, reluctant to depart even as night deepened. The master said: *\"The Elder of Everlasting Spring’s poem declares:\nWhite hair and aged face, yet immortality remains unfinished,\nRoaming mountains, drinking from streams—lingering still.\nNot that I disdain the many offices of Heaven,\nBut I fear the worldly entanglements of the human realm.\"*\n\nWorldly entanglements run deep and obstruct the Dao in countless ways. Human sentiments prize splendor, which runs counter to the Way. This earnest attachment and lingering affection are but manifestations of love—where there is love, there is also aversion, giving rise to joy, anger, sorrow, and delight. All are but emotions. If one cannot transcend emotion, how can one enter the Dao?\n\nThe love between parent and child may be called profound, yet even this does not burden the enlightened. As *Liezi* records of Dongmen Wu: when his son died, he felt no grief. Asked why, he replied, *\"Formerly, I lived as one without a son; now that he has died, it is no different. Only when one is without attachment can there be perfect kinship.\"* To regard all elders in the world as one’s own elders, all children as one’s own children, all things as belonging to oneself, and to view all with equal benevolence—is this not perfect kinship? Thus *Zhuangzi* says: *\"Supreme benevolence is without attachment.\"* If one is partial to those one loves, then there are those one does not love; if one cherishes what one favors, then there is what one does not favor. Such are the sentiments of the common world. The follower of the Dao must reverse this.\n\nWhatever the world loves, one should not love excessively; whatever the world hates, one should not hate excessively. Though the emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and delight may arise, they should be expressed in moderation, without harming one’s inner harmony. Thus the mind attains its natural equilibrium, and in equilibrium, the mind is perfected. As it is said: *\"Buddha-nature is originally without awakening; sentient beings are fundamentally not deluded. The ordinary use of the mind—this alone is bodhi.\"*\n\nThe Dao is fundamentally non-action; it is simply the perfection of the mind. Cultivating the mind to attain equilibrium allows the Dao to arise spontaneously. It is like tending a field: removing tiles and stones, clearing brambles, and eliminating what harms the sprouts; then, following the seasons and proper methods, sowing the seeds—without seeking the sprouts, they grow of themselves. Thus it is said: *\"The Dao is fundamentally non-action; it is simply the perfection of the mind.\"*\n\nIt is also said: *\"Perfection of the mind is the one method by which the ten thousand practices are complete.\"* Have you not seen how the true masters, though receiving direct transmission from the patriarchs, still undergo a thousand refinements and a hundred trials to discipline their minds? This is because, though their nature issues from the Dao, once embodied in form, it becomes burdened by emotions and desires. For form is inherited from one’s parents, constituted by the qi of yin and yang, and thus subject to movement and stillness—this is its principle.\n\nEven if a single good thought arises, it may be driven by the form and qi, preventing its fulfillment. Therefore, those of resolve know that the mind’s nature originally issues from the Dao, and they do not allow form and qi to usurp their will. With time, they overcome these obstacles, and both qi and form are transformed, merging seamlessly back into their original nature. All this is achieved through the equilibrium of the mind. When the mind is balanced, the spirit is settled; when the spirit is settled, the qi is attuned, and the Dao arises of itself. Thus it is said: *\"When form and spirit are both refined, they unite with the true Dao.\"*\n\nIf one does not shed the burdens of emotion to balance the mind, one merely wears out the body in vain, and none can enter the Dao. Those of superior endowment are born with knowledge and are not burdened by emotions; those of lesser endowment are dull and fail to grasp emotion; emotion resides only in the middling person—now present, now absent, capable of rising or falling. Through good habits, one ascends; through bad habits, one descends. The difference between good and evil is as vast as cloud and mud.\n\nConfucius said: *\"By nature, people are similar; by habit, they grow apart.\"* Therefore, one cannot afford to be without learning. I say that the ten scriptures and ten thousand methods are designed for the middling person. Teaching is to instruct what one does not yet know; learning is to awaken to what one has not yet realized. Once one knows what was unknown and awakens to what was unrealized, one must then put it into practice. When practice reaches its culmination, the mind and the method become one, and even the method may be discarded.\n\nThe method is like medicine: once the illness is cured, one need not take medicine further. Learning what was unrealized is wisdom and merit; propagating the teachings and benefiting beings is practice. Accumulating merit and practice forms the foundation of the Dao. Only by abandoning learning and relinquishing methods can one enter the Dao. Thus it is said: *\"To abandon learning is to be without care.\"* Without care, one perceives true emptiness, and without words, the Dao moves of itself. Like the Way of Heaven, which operates without effort, the four seasons proceed and the hundred things grow—what action is needed?",

      "translated_text": "At the Yizhou Chaoyuan Abbey, the assembly gathered for evening discourse, speaking of the variations and changes in the teachings and disciplines of the Daoist gate. The Master said: *\"The Book of Changes* states: ‘The meaning of adapting to the times is truly great.’ This means that in human activity and stillness, one must always follow what is appropriate to the time. If not, there is nothing that does not lose its proper measure.\n\nMaster Danyang taught with non-action as the foundation, while Master Changsheng the True Man blended non-action and action equally. By the time of Master Changchun, action accounted for nine-tenths, and though non-action remained as one-tenth, it was preserved yet unused. The Dao is the same, but the times differ.\n\nFor instance, Master Danyang’s *Ten Exhortations* states: ‘A thatched hut should not exceed three bays.’ In today’s age, this may no longer be feasible; if one rigidly adheres to it, no benefit will be seen. It is like planting millet in winter—though one may expend double the effort, it will never come to fruition. The teachings of today, though largely emphasizing action, do not entirely reject non-action; it is simply that when the time is not right, it is preserved yet unused.\n\nMoreover, this is the tenth month—no one would plant millet now, for all know it cannot grow. Yet when spring comes, it may be planted; how could one not understand this principle? When I first studied the Dao, I awakened to the illusory nature of all things, reducing and refining until reaching non-action. Later, receiving the true instructions of my masters and delving into the principles of creation and transformation, I came to know the greatness of timely application.\n\nI recall Master Yuyang taking my hand and saying: ‘Seven golden lotuses bear fruit.’ Today, ten thousand jade lotuses bloom—yet they are all wild flowers. Thus, while the root of the Dao is natural, one must first practice action to accumulate merit and deeds, advancing ceaselessly. When external works are complete, attainment comes of itself without seeking.\n\nIt is said: ‘The radiant elixir is completed in a single day.’ Yet if disciples cling to these words, believing there is truly a principle by which it can be achieved in a day, they will wait in vain. What is meant is that when merit and practice reach their culmination, Heaven bestows the Dao, and sudden awakening arises in the heart—hence ‘completed in a day.’ If there were truly a principle by which one could attain the Dao in a day without merit or practice, then everyone who received a single word from a true master could enter the Dao, and why would the patriarchs and masters have labored so diligently to teach and transform others, enduring such hardships in cultivation?\n\nYongjia said: ‘The true nature of ignorance is Buddha-nature; the illusory, empty body is the Dharma-body.’ This refers to the blinking of an eye, the raising of a brow, the movement of an arm, or the use of a finger. Though this is so, why then are there those who fall into hell? It is because ignorance and illusion must be tempered and refined without remainder before nature and life are naturally united as one. Thus, one must enter through action.\n\nNon-action and action are not two separate paths; it depends entirely on what the time requires.\"",

      "translated_text": "Confucius said to Yan Yuan: \"When employed, act; when set aside, conceal.\" The choice between employment and retirement depends on the times; action and concealment follow the principle of adapting to the times. If one does not grasp this, then both advance and retreat lose their proper measure—how can the Dao be illuminated, how can affairs be accomplished? Truly, the principle of adapting to the times is of great significance.\n\nThe state employs both civil and martial means, never lacking either. In times of order, civil governance is put to use; in times of chaos, martial force is put to use. Change and response follow the times, alternating as substance and function, yet the Dao remains one. How could the teachings of our school differ in this regard?\n\nThis I heard from Master Changchun. The Master’s heart was most humble and yielding, vast in compassion and great in mercy. Every word he spoke was never the slightest bit beyond the truth. He often said: \"The Dao of non-action cannot be seen when looked for, cannot be heard when listened for, and cannot be reached even when pursued to the end. Even for one like me, who has attained longevity, doubts still linger, and halfway along the path, I nearly faltered. Thus, it is no easy task for later generations to practice. Nothing compares to accumulating merit and conduct—this is most effective.\n\nIf one is determined to cultivate merit and conduct, nothing surpasses hospitality. For all who pass by—when hungry, give them food; when weary, let them rest; in cold or heat, provide comfort. To bestow such virtue upon others—can this merit not be called supreme? If one maintains sincerity without wavering over time, then divine retribution will surely respond. Even if it has not yet arrived, external assistance will come. The subtle and manifest responses in the unseen are beyond full expression.\n\nWhat I have personally experienced, I have never spoken of to others. If one has accomplished one part of merit, to speak of it as one part is still within one’s proper duty. But if one claims it as two parts, all prior merit is nullified. To remain silent and not speak of it, the merit is doubled. Thus it is said: 'Seek not the knowledge of others, only the scrutiny of Heaven.' The *Classic* states: 'Virtue is built as if stolen.'\n\nIf one has performed a good deed and others slander it, yet one does not argue, the merit is also doubled. But if one argues, even if the slander is refuted, what benefit is there? For those who cultivate the Dao, there is not a moment when they are not in communion with the divine—why concern themselves with whether others know or not? The *Classic* states: 'The good do not argue.' Scholars must understand this principle.\n\nOne night in the abbot’s quarters of Tongxian Abbey, Zhao Zhiwan sang Master’s *Dreaming of Wandering as an Immortal*. When the song ended, the assembly rose to bow and asked for its meaning. The Master said:\n\nBefore Master Danyang left the household life, his nature was bold and unrestrained, and he loved to drink. Yet he had already begun practicing the methods of merit and conduct, for he knew that the root-source of the Dao lay within his own nature. When he first met the Patriarch, he recognized him as no ordinary man and asked: 'What is the Dao?' The Patriarch replied: 'Where the Five Phases do not reach, before father and mother were born.' Profound indeed are these words!\n\nIn my youth, I crudely studied yin and yang, and thus I know that all people are bound within them. Moreover, the Five Constants of human nature received in this life are the inclinations cultivated in past lives. Once habits form, they create resonance. For example, if one was fond of benevolence in a past life, in this life one will bear the phase of Wood; if fond of propriety, the phase of Fire; if fond of righteousness or wisdom, the phases of Metal or Water, and so on. Since inclinations vary, one inevitably bears the impure and mixed phases of the Five. This is called the resonance of habitual nature, also known as cause and effect. Present fortunes, careers, and social stations all arise from the cause and effect of the Five Phases.\n\nWhat habits does the original nature possess? Without habits, what resonance is there? Without resonance or habits, this is 'where the Five Phases do not reach, before father and mother were born.' Once practitioners recognize that what they love now is what they cultivated over many lives, they must completely eliminate it. They should begin by removing the most deeply ingrained habits, gradually eradicating all attachments until both mind and form are forgotten. Then, in a sudden awakening, they enter the realm of immortals.\n\nThus, the opening of this song says: 'Dreaming of wandering as an immortal.' If even a single deluded thought arises in the heart, it is like a cloud of confusion—it must be removed to attain clarity. Hence the lines: 'Gathering qi, pure and congealed, white clouds drift boundlessly.'\n\n*Zhuangzi* says: 'The breath of the perfected reaches to the heels; the breath of ordinary people reaches only to the throat.' Without true skill, practitioners cannot even reach the Central Elixir Field—how could they gradually deepen to reach the heels? The Master said: 'The perfected do not merely reach the heels—their light shines as one from top to bottom.' Hence the lines: 'Great radiance envelops the golden lotus.' The golden lotus is the heart.\n\nIf practitioners encounter adverse circumstances, they must not allow the slightest disturbance in their hearts. As the Chan school says: 'Even if an iron wheel spins atop the head, concentration and wisdom remain perfectly clear and unshaken.' Thus the song says: 'All are endowed with the power of virtue and Dao, spiritual penetrations and self-mastery. Even the force of kalpas cannot alter them. Further tempering refines habitual nature to the softness of silk, while the resolve to advance in the Dao remains as firm as metal and stone. Always abide above the myriad things, allowing nothing to stain or cling.'\n\nPractitioners must take virtue and the Dao as their root-source. Though external affairs may change endlessly, they are but illusory movements. Respond to them as they come, yet one’s tranquil true essence never stirs. It is like casting myriad vessels from yellow gold—their shapes differ, yet the true essence of gold never changes. Hence the lines: 'Responding to thoughts as they arise, without hindrance, for there is a root-source.'\n\nIf one’s heart has not yet perceived this, one cannot grasp the purport of these words. One must accumulate merit and conduct. When merit and conduct reach fruition, clarity will naturally respond. Until practitioners thoroughly penetrate the divine and perceive the Dao, this is the unvarnished truth. Let all take heed.\n\n*Record of the Northern Journey of Master Qinghe, Scroll Two* ends.\n*Record of the Northern Journey of Master Qinghe, Scroll Three* begins.",
      "overlap_context": "-nature; the illusory, empty body is the Dharma-body.’ This refers to the blinking of an eye, the raising of a brow, the movement of an arm, or the use of a finger. Though this is so, why then are there those who fall into hell? It is because ignorance and illusion must be tempered and refined without remainder before nature and life are naturally united as one. Thus, one must enter through action.\n\nNon-action and action are not two separate paths; it depends entirely on what the time requires.\"",

      "original_text": "弟子段志坚编 癸巳冬十月，义州通仙观，命郭志全讲《道德经》。 首章有云：玄之又玄。 志全云：无极之妙也。 师曰：大凡书中重称之辞，皆不尽意，此非《论语》时哉时哉之类也。 以明天中复有天之妙理。 夫人禀元气以生，性中各具一天，若人人能自通明，而所行尽合其道，则虽无经教可也。 盖缘众人为物欲所引，迷不能复，是故圣人重哀之，设此教法以，开觉拯救之。 学者当因其经而究其用，贵在躬行，行之既熟，从容中道尚何待？ 为学未至此地，欲弃学亦不可也。 故有云：人禀元气以生，得其清者为贤，浊者为愚。 此特明其大盘，曾不及其用。 信如此言，则贤止於贤，愚止於愚，是绝为学之路。 吾闻师父尝言：道气化生天地，长养万物，其中把握，有至圣存焉。 得其大者为圣贤，小者为常大，飞潜蠢动之属，止得其偏者耳。 此至明之理。 虽万类不同，其出於道则一也。 既出於道，而皆具道性。 况人为物灵，则有可复於道之理。 只缘多生迷於所习，失其常性，不能自反。 今者因经教明此至理，便合言下领受，将积习迷情一皆除去，不求於道而道自得。 《阴符经》三章，其一神仙抱一，无为自然也； 其二富国安民，积行累功也； 其三强兵战胜，物欲染习害吾正性，两者交战，能以道胜之，非有志者不能。 经云：强行者有志。 又云：自胜者强。 凡己之爱恶一能反过，苦於己，利於物，自损自卑，任物欺凌而不劝，此自胜之道也。 初则强行，久则纯熟，渐至自然，物欲净尽，一性空虚，此禅家谓之空寂，吾教谓之清静。 此犹未也，至寂无所寂之地，则近矣。 虽然至此，若无真实功行，不能造化，无造化则不得入於真道，须入真道则方见性中之天，是为玄之又玄。 至此则言辞举动，凡所出者无非玄妙，故继之曰众妙之门。 讲《天下皆知章》，剖析六对，至圣人处无为之事，云：此非有为对待之无为，乃无为无所不为之无为也。 故以尧让许由之事证之。 云：以边观之，则尧有为而许无为； 以道论之，则尧未尝不无为，许未尝不有为也。 尧虽居天下之大，如寄如托，而不有其天下，故虽天下之大，而不能累其心，其让非无为何？ 许之辞曰：子治天下，天下既已治也，吾不为名，名者实之宾，遂不受。 且天下既已治，则故不受，或当天下之未治，则许将若之何？ 亦必有所为也。 尧、许同道，易地则皆然。 故曰：尧未尝不无为，许亦未尝不有为也。 惟其应变随时，处之合道，初无心於其问，是以并称圣人。 师曰：学道之宾主，不可不明也。 学道是主，万缘皆宾。 凡与缘接待，轻重尘劳，一切功行，皆是求道之资，无有不可为者。 惟不可有所着，一有所着，则失其正矣。 今之积累功行人甚多，然少有功成不居，为而不恃者，既有恃着，止是有为福德。 若为一切功行无恃着之心，则受虚无之功，获自然之福，虽曰有为，吾必谓之无为矣。 凡一切功行尘劳，实为求学之资，非为功名也。 正似农人竭力耕稼，及百工日用其技，其心主於谋食，而耕稼及所为之技，皆是宾也。 要终日经营，而无着於经营。 虽圣人岂无经营，独不主於经营耳。 故有云：圣人有经营之迹，无经营之心。 凡所经营者，皆迹也。",
      "translated_text": "Disciple Duan Zhijian compiled this. In the tenth month of winter, the gui-si year, at Tongxian Abbey in Yizhou, Guo Zhiquan was commanded to lecture on the *Daode Jing*. Its first chapter states: \"Mysterious, and again mysterious.\" Zhiquan said: \"This is the subtlety of the Limitless.\" The Master replied: \"Generally, when books employ reiterated terms, they do not fully express their meaning—this is not like the *Analects*’ ‘timely, oh timely!’ Rather, it reveals the wondrous principle that within Heaven there is yet another Heaven. All people are endowed with primordial qi at birth, and each possesses a Heaven within their nature. If every person could attain self-illumination and act wholly in accord with the Dao, then even without scriptural teachings, it would suffice. Yet because the multitude are led astray by material desires, they become deluded and cannot return. Thus the sages, grieving deeply, established these teachings to awaken and deliver them. Scholars must study the scriptures to fathom their application, valuing above all personal practice. Once practice is thoroughly mastered, one moves with ease in the central Way—what more is needed? Until one reaches this state, abandoning study is not permissible. As it is said: ‘People are born of primordial qi; those who obtain its purity become worthy, while those who receive its turbidity become foolish.’ This merely clarifies the broad outline, without touching upon its application. If one accepts this as truth, then the worthy remain merely worthy, and the foolish remain merely foolish—thus is the path of learning cut off.\n\nI have heard my Master say: ‘The Dao and qi transform and give birth to Heaven and Earth, nurturing the myriad things. Within this process, there is a supreme sageliness. Those who grasp its greatness become sages and worthies; those who grasp its lesser aspects become ordinary people, birds, beasts, and creeping things—these attain only a partial share. This is the most luminous of principles. Though the ten thousand kinds differ, their origin in the Dao is one. Since all emerge from the Dao, all possess the nature of the Dao. How much more so for humans, the most spiritually endowed of beings, who inherently possess the principle of returning to the Dao. Yet through many lives, they become deluded by habitual tendencies, losing their constant nature and unable to turn back. Now, through the teachings of the scriptures, this supreme principle is made clear. One should immediately accept it upon hearing, completely eliminating accumulated habits and deluded affections. Without seeking the Dao, the Dao is naturally attained.’\n\nThe *Yinfu Jing* has three chapters: the first, ‘Immortals embrace the One, acting without contrivance, naturally’; the second, ‘Enriching the state and pacifying the people through accumulating deeds and amassing merit’; the third, ‘Strengthening the army and achieving victory—when material desires and habitual tendencies harm our true nature, the two engage in battle. Only by overcoming them with the Dao can one succeed, and this is not possible without resolve.’ The scripture says: ‘Those who practice vigorously possess resolve.’ It also says: ‘Those who conquer themselves are strong.’ Whenever one’s likes and dislikes can be reversed—what is bitter to oneself benefiting others—when one diminishes and humbles oneself, enduring others’ mistreatment without resistance, this is the way of self-conquest. Initially, one practices with effort, but over time, it becomes second nature. Gradually, material desires are entirely purified, and the single nature becomes empty and void—what Chan Buddhists call ‘emptiness and quiescence,’ and our tradition calls ‘purity and stillness.’ Yet this is still not the ultimate. When stillness reaches the point where there is no place for stillness, one draws near. Even so, without true and solid merit and conduct, one cannot effect transformation. Without transformation, one cannot enter the true Dao. Only by entering the true Dao does one perceive the Heaven within one’s nature—this is the ‘mysterious, and again mysterious.’ At this stage, every word and action, all that issues forth, is nothing but the wondrous. Thus it is followed by ‘the gate of the manifold mysteries.’\n\nLecturing on the chapter ‘When all under Heaven know beauty as beauty,’ he analyzed six pairs of opposites, arriving at the sage’s engagement in ‘non-action.’ He said: ‘This is not the non-action that opposes action, but the non-action that leaves nothing undone.’ To illustrate, he cited the story of Yao yielding to Xu You. From a worldly perspective, Yao acted while Xu did not; from the perspective of the Dao, Yao was never not in non-action, and Xu was never not in action. Though Yao governed the vastness of the world, he regarded it as a temporary lodging, not possessing it. Thus, though the world was vast, it could not burden his heart. Was his yielding not non-action? Xu declined, saying: ‘You govern the world, and the world is already well-governed. I do not seek fame, for fame is but the guest of reality.’ He thus refused. Yet if the world were not already well-governed, what would Xu have done? He would surely have acted. Yao and Xu shared the same Dao; had their positions been reversed, each would have done the same. Thus it is said: ‘Yao was never not in non-action, and Xu was never not in action.’ Only by responding to change in a timely manner, acting in accord with the Dao, and remaining free of preconceptions in all situations can both be called sages.’\n\nThe Master said: ‘The roles of guest and host in learning the Dao must be clearly understood. Learning the Dao is the host; the myriad conditions are guests. In all interactions with conditions—whether matters of importance or trivial labor, all deeds and conduct—these are resources for seeking the Dao, and nothing is impermissible. Only one must not become attached. Once attachment arises, one loses the correct path. Today, many accumulate merit and conduct, yet few achieve merit without claiming it, acting without reliance. Once reliance and attachment exist, it is merely merit within the realm of action. If one performs all deeds and conduct without a heart of reliance or attachment, one receives the merit of emptiness and obtains natural blessings. Though called action, I must deem it non-action. All deeds, conduct, and worldly labors are truly resources for seeking learning, not for the sake of merit or fame. It is like farmers exhausting themselves in plowing and sowing, or artisans plying their crafts daily—their minds are set on securing sustenance, while plowing, sowing, and their crafts are but guests. One must engage in these activities all day without becoming attached to them. Even sages are not without such engagement; they simply do not make it their primary concern.’ Thus it is said: ‘Sages leave traces of engagement, but no mind of engagement. All their engagements are but traces.’\"",

      "translated_text": "Once attached to traces, one immediately falls into duality. Only by not clinging to a single thing can one penetrate into emptiness and thus transcend duality. I have once said: \"Trample through emptiness to leave the six pairs behind.\" Yongjia also said: \"All conditioned things are impermanent and empty—this is the great perfect enlightenment of the Tathāgata.\" When cultivators embody this to the utmost, they enter the realm where things have never yet arisen. Master Shen said: \"Where the five phases do not reach, the time before father and mother were born.\" This is the ultimate.\n\nHere ends the explication of the chapter \"Not Exalting the Worthy.\"\n\nThe Master said: \"The meaning of this chapter encompasses more than half of the Dao and its virtue. Disciples must first comprehend its various names and forms; only then will they encounter fewer confusions when reading the scriptures. Terms like 'dragon,' 'tiger,' 'infant,' and 'maiden' all arise from the primordial qi and yin-yang. When Buddhists speak of 'teaching' and 'Chan,' the names differ, but the principle is one. If one can transform things within the heart, then nothing will not be at one’s disposal.\n\nThe chapter begins by speaking of governing the state, yet how is this different from governing the self? The heart is the ruler, and the hundred limbs are all subjects. When the ruler is well-governed, the state is well-governed; when the heart is well-governed, the hundred limbs naturally follow order.\n\nI recall when Master Dading questioned Master Xuan during an audience, discussing various methods of practice. Only visualization of the lower elixir field was deemed most essential—yet it was but one method, not the Dao itself. In recent years, Wang the Daoist of Yangzhou has taken this as the ultimate practice and taught it to others, unaware that such contrived methods of deliberate action can never lead to the true Dao. I have often said: Just as one may use techniques to force flowers to bloom in winter, they will never bear fruit.\n\nWhen he came to seek instruction, I told him the truth. Upon leaving, he remarked: 'To speak of nature without addressing destiny—what kind of teaching is this?' When not a single thing burdens the heart, and it remains clear and empty, then all twelve hours of the day become blessed with virtue. One does not seek a full belly, yet the belly is naturally full. Reduce and reduce again until not a single thought arises—then one’s will is weak, and when the will is weak, the bones are strong. This, too, is none other than the natural Dao. Beyond this, there is something called 'destiny,' but I know not what it is.\n\nGenerally, when disciples first set their minds on the Dao, none fail to be resolute. Yet many abandon their practice midway, for they seek quick success. When they do not soon see results, doubt arises, and this is why they give up. When the heart is not yet settled, it is like one afflicted with a grave illness who seeks out physicians. They follow the prescribed methods, but if no effect appears after some time, they seek another doctor. When that too proves ineffective, doubt arises. After repeated attempts, even if a renowned physician speaks, they no longer believe. They never pause to reflect on their own destiny.\n\nThose who attain the Dao—people see only their present accomplishment, unaware that it results from five, ten, or even a hundred lifetimes of accumulated cultivation. Only in this lifetime has it come to fruition. Have you not seen that before leaving the household, all true masters already possessed the foundation of the heart-mind? Master Yuyang once said: In his twenty-eighth year, Master Taigu was a diviner in the mountains of Shandong. One day, he casually wrote a poem whose meaning none but an accomplished Daoist could fathom. Later, upon encountering the Patriarch and entering the Dao, he said that attaining the Dao was not difficult. After forty days beneath the bridge at Wozhou, he completed the Dao—could this have been possible without the merit of past lives?\n\nWhen I resided at Yuqing Abbey, I witnessed the celestial gates open in the realm of vision. I once asked my master about this. He said: 'This is still not it. Compared to the completion of the Dao, such wondrous states cannot be described.' When the Dao-qi fills the interior, one is in a state of vague indistinctness, like the nine-four line of the *Qian* hexagram: 'Perhaps leaping in the abyss.' One probes and trusts in the great radiance that envelops the purple golden lotus.\n\nAt first, I did not understand, but after entering the Dao, I realized that this principle is inherent in everyone. When Master Danyang first opened the teaching, he spoke only of the ease of attaining the Dao. His disciples revered and believed his words, yet after three or five years, they saw no results. One day, as the assembly gathered, a senior disciple asked: 'Master, you say the Dao is easily attained. Yet when we observe those who have attained it, they all seem to have the good fortune of past lives—it cannot be accomplished in a single lifetime.' The Master glared and shouted: 'If you know this, why do you not immediately begin cultivation?' The assembly withdrew, convinced by his words.\n\nToday, I say to you all: Do not harbor doubt. Do not neglect your daily practice. When encountering adverse circumstances, do not let your heart waver. Each moment of forbearance is a moment of victory. Take care not to procrastinate or act carelessly, lest you accumulate the roots of transgression and surely fall. My divinations have never been false.\n\nHere ends the explication of the chapter 'The Valley Spirit Does Not Die,' incorporating the interpretations of various schools. The assembly requested the Master’s verification.\n\nThe Master said: 'The explanations of the various schools each have their reasons. Yet He Shanggong was a divine being, so his commentary is detailed on matters of nature and destiny but brief on external affairs—just as other schools rarely speak of inner cultivation. For those engaged in practice, none is more useful to receive than He Shanggong’s.\n\nThe chapter 'The Valley Spirit Does Not Die' represents the ultimate application of the Dao. Yet if beginners attempt to employ it, they will miss the mark. I say: One must first fully practice the meanings of the preceding five chapters before one can apply the Dao of the valley spirit. Thus, it is placed as the sixth chapter.\n\nI recall when my master was in Weizhou, resting in the flower garden’s thatched pavilion. I, along with Master Zhao Xujing, Master Lao Xiao, and the Dragon-Tiger Thousand-Household, attended him. The master expounded the great meaning of this chapter, saying: 'During the Dading era, when I had an audience at court, after presenting my memorial, I was graciously asked to transmit the Dao. I consented in my heart to teach the chapter on the valley spirit. Even an emperor of ten thousand chariots earnestly sought the Dao—how much more so one who truly possesses virtue and conduct, who is worthy of transmission. Yet one must first observe the precepts for seven days before it can be done.' He said: 'I cannot.'\"",

It is like farmers exhausting themselves in plowing and sowing, or artisans plying their crafts daily—their minds are set on securing sustenance, while plowing, sowing, and their crafts are but guests. One must engage in these activities all day without becoming attached to them. Even sages are not without such engagement; they simply do not make it their primary concern.’ Thus it is said: ‘Sages leave traces of engagement, but no mind of engagement. All their engagements are but traces.’\"",

      "translated_text": "After reducing it to five days, he still said he could not. Further reducing it to three days, even the attendants considered it difficult, and so the matter was dropped.\n\nWhen I and Dan Yang both encountered the Patriarch to study the Dao, he commanded me to re-engage in worldly toil, allowing no respite. While Dan Yang and I silently discussed the mysteries, one day he shut his door. I secretly listened and heard him transmitting the method of the valley spirit’s immortal breath regulation. After a long while, he pushed open the door and entered, and I ceased my eavesdropping.\n\nAfter my worldly affairs were concluded, I diligently practiced the method I had overheard. Though I practiced assiduously, Dan Yang attained the Dao in two and a half years, while I endured ten thousand hardships for eighteen or nineteen years without verification. The Dao transmitted by the Patriarch was one and the same—why then such disparity in attainment? It was simply that each person’s accumulated merit and conduct differed in depth. Thus, the time of realization varied.\n\nDan Yang had cultivated for more than one lifetime; by this life, his merit and conduct were complete. Applying the Dao of the valley spirit at that moment, he swiftly saw its verification. My merit and conduct were incomplete, so even with prolonged practice, no verification appeared—this was only natural.\n\nThose who cultivate the Dao must first wholly abandon worldly affairs, uniformly cultivate the ten thousand practices, ensuring nothing burdens them, and focus the mind to utter emptiness, reaching the state of quiescence beyond quiescence. When merit and conduct are both complete, fortune arrives; with fortune comes the opening of the heart. A single point of radiance penetrates, and the root of heaven and earth—two things—naturally merge into one. Only then does one apply the ceaseless Dao to nurture it, filling it to fullness, and thus achieving immortality for endless kalpas.\n\nAs Zhang Pingshu said: *\"If the cauldron lacks the true seed, you merely boil an empty pot with water and fire.\"* Entry into the Dao has its gradations, all verified by the purity of fortune and virtue before advancement.\n\nNowadays, some do not cultivate solid merit and conduct to build their fortune but instead labor in vain imaginings, seeking to enter the true Dao—none avoid falling into emptiness. How lamentable!\n\nIn the past, at the hall in Shandong, a visitor came to inquire. Originally a wealthy merchant from the western route, he had encountered the Perfected Lord of True Yang, who transmitted a subtle secret. That very day, he abandoned his wealth, and worldly desires faded from his heart. The Patriarch only taught him to accumulate merit, cautioning him not to wander outwardly. If others came to know, they would inevitably show reverence, and over time, this would bring harm, making the Dao difficult to attain.\n\nThus, even with a true transmission, one must also accumulate merit and conduct to augment one’s fortune before achieving success.\n\nA disciple asked about the meaning of \"emerging from life and entering death\" in the scripture. The master said: *\"The commentary of He Shanggong may be consulted.\"*\n\nThe \"thirteen\" refers to the ten having three—namely, the four limbs and nine orifices, or the seven emotions and six desires. Emerging from them is the way of life; entering them is the way of death. Yet people, through excessive attachment to life, move toward the realm of death.\n\nThus, those who skillfully preserve life avoid entering the realm of death, and even tigers, rhinoceroses, armor, and weapons cannot harm them. Once a person has accumulated evil karma, they possess a realm of death, and malevolent qi follows them. Thus, they encounter adversity—all are repayment of past debts.\n\nIf one has no evil debts and interacts with others, harmony arises naturally. Harmony is not singular: there is superficial harmony and spiritual harmony. When countenances are harmonious and free of malice, it is superficial harmony, yet questions may still arise. Spiritual harmony occurs when the spirit harmonizes before familiarity, leaving no room for doubt. This arises from having no accumulated evil.\n\nAs Yongjia said: *\"When enlightened, karmic obstacles are originally empty; unenlightened, one must repay past debts.\"* Good and evil both have retribution. For instance, if I offer others a joyful countenance, they respond with joy; if I treat them with harsh arrogance, they inevitably retaliate in kind. This is the natural Dao.\n\nEven minor transgressions and compliances must be repaid. If one truly harms others or damages things, how could there be no retribution? To avoid retribution, one must avoid karma. Karma arises from the body; having a body means having karma. The seven emotions and six desires assail one internally and externally. Even with utmost restraint, one may fail; if indulged, transgressions multiply.\n\nMaster Yu Yang spoke most incisively: *\"If you wish to cultivate the Dao, first scold this false body.\"* The reason people’s karmic roots are not severed, leaving them with a realm of death, is all due to this false body. Only Master Dan Yang could cut off all karmic roots, eliminating the realm of death. If even a fraction of karma remains, a fraction of retribution follows.\n\nI have often said that all methods share a single principle. For example, diviners who assess a person’s fate might say that, generally, within ten parts, three parts are afflicted by malevolent stars, and their nature indeed has three parts of evil. Why? Because in their past life’s habitual nature, three parts of evil remained unresolved, and the malevolent stars were self-induced. When encountering circumstances, three parts of evil manifest. If the opposition has ten parts, then ten parts respond. Each follows the measure of one’s own share—whether encountering evil people or facing evil events.\n\nLike shadow following form, like echo answering sound, this principle operates everywhere without exception. The ignorant, failing to examine themselves, may meet someone who, for no reason, treats them with malice, and they wish to resent that person. Yet if their own evil remains unremoved, their evil only multiplies, surpassing the original offense by who knows how many times. This is why people often grow fully evil without self-awareness.\n\nIt is better to eradicate one’s own evil entirely, leaving no opposition—how then could external evil arise? Those who cultivate the Dao focus solely on self-governance. Whether dwelling alone or among hundreds, they only govern themselves. Once this principle is understood, one must take responsibility in the present moment; otherwise, the next life will be no different.",

      "translated_text": "Why is this so? It is because the seeds of habit remain embedded within one’s nature. This is called \"seed-nature.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Master, you have said that humans receive the nature of the Five Phases, all transformed by habitual tendencies—does this follow the same principle?\"\n\nThe Master replied: \"Indeed. If one can reverse this tendency, then one lifts heaven and earth, grasping the ungraspable within yin and yang and the Five Phases. Thus, the Patriarch once said: *In the midst of shattering, inquire into that single point, and you will surpass the divine boat to reach the shore.* Only when nothing in the heart obstructs anything else is perfection attained. If even one thing remains untranscended, one has not yet succeeded.\"\n\nWhen the Master first sought the Dao, he resolved with unyielding determination, shattering his heart. Even the most stubborn habits could not withstand a hundred days without being entirely purified. He once said: \"I fear no ferocious tiger, yet when I saw temple statues, I felt dread. So I deliberately visited them often, even lodging in their halls. After three years of this, the fear vanished.\"\n\nThus, we know that whatever difficulties arise in the heart are but passing emotions. With resolute will, none cannot be overcome—only a lack of resolve is the obstacle.\n\nWhen the discourse on the *Carrying the Po and Embracing the Qi* chapter concluded, the disciple asked the Master for verification.\n\nThe Master said: \"The works of Laozi and Zhuangzi do not fully express their meaning; without attaining the Dao, their subtleties are hard to grasp. Chan sayings resemble riddles, perplexing to the uninitiated—not because they are deliberately obscure, but because their truths transcend language, leaving no choice but to speak thus.\"\n\nZhiquan asked: \"Does Chan resemble the teachings of Laozi and Zhuangzi?\"\n\nThe Master replied: \"Chan focuses on revealing the fundamental nature. Its wonders do not exceed what Laozi and Zhuangzi described. Thus, it borrows their words to convey its profundities; without such language, there would be no means to point to them. The mastery of Chan’s expressions allows one to play freely with them—yet without attaining the Dao, none can forget them.\"\n\n\"Moreover, must those who attain the Dao all come from scriptural study? Before scriptures existed, were there no such people? Master Yuyang attained the Dao before reading the *Daodejing*. Yet when expounding its teachings, one must rely on words.\"\n\n\"This chapter on *Carrying the Po and Embracing the Qi* is like taking a person by the hand to instruct them in cultivation. I recall Master Bingwang, who sought the Dao with unwavering resolve, forgetting form and world, eating without regard for taste, merely filling his stomach. For four years, his practice aligned perfectly with this chapter’s principles.\"\n\n\"One day, in stillness, I felt qi surging upward, and a sound erupted at the crown of my head. My skull seemed to split open, and a sweet fluid descended abundantly. Afterward, no further signs appeared, and doubt arose. I sought the Patriarch’s hall to inquire.\"\n\n\"Whenever a resident had doubts, the Patriarch never refused them. He sternly rebuked me, asking what doubts could remain in one who cultivates the Dao. Knowing my sincerity, he permitted repeated questioning.\"\n\nHe said: \"Have you not read the *Daodejing*’s words on the opening and closing of the heavenly gate?\"\n\nThereafter, the Patriarch often questioned me. When he learned that no further signs appeared, he instructed me to reside in the abbey, accumulating merit through service. Thus, even with arduous practice, without completing the work of virtue, attainment remains unfulfilled.\n\nWhen Master Yuyang was still a householder, he knew not what he desired, and after leaving home, he remained undefiled. Later, on Iron-Fork Mountain, one night he experienced a lapse and wept bitterly, wishing to consume it. The heavens responded by bestowing the qi of harmony. Three days later, he regained his heart-ground. Only then did the thousand refinements and hundred trials begin: he knelt among sand and stones without rising, his knees worn to the bone. The mountain was full of sharp rocks and thorns, yet he walked barefoot among them, earning the name 'Iron Feet.' After three years of this, his past karma was finally exhausted.\"\n\n\"Those who seek the Dao must understand this principle.\"",

In my twenty-seventh kalpa, I was a cow, and thus in this life my nature remains dull and unable to recognize written words. The cow-mother once came seeking my deliverance.\"\n\nThe Buddhist teaching says: \"Those who attain the Dao can liberate their parents of three lifetimes.\" But I say: they can liberate the billions of ancestors across ten thousand generations.\n\nThe Master said: \"Elder Changsheng foretold many events before their signs appeared—it would be difficult to recount them all. For instance, he summoned Old Master Ji to the hall, and within days, Ji passed away. He also called Official Zhu the Second without cause, and after seven days, Zhu departed. Old Ji—known as Ji of Mount Gang—had made his living through the yin and yang of the two dwellings. Abandoning wife and children, he left home with great resolve and dwelled on Divine Mountain for fifteen years, never once glancing back at his former gate.\"\n\nElder Changsheng asked someone: \"Who in Laizhou is the wealthiest?\" When told of the richest, he said: \"None are richer than Master Ji of Mount Gang. He has already attained the fruit of purity—even if gold and jade covered the earth, how could they be bought? Is this not the greatest wealth?\" Though Official Zhu the Second had not yet reached such a heart-ground, his merit and practice were vast.\n\nWhen the lecture reached the chapter \"Favor and disgrace cause alarm,\" the Master said: \"To speak plainly within our teaching, this is easily understood. A single phrase can resolve it: 'Beware of clinging to the false.' Once you know the body is false, you must not cling to it—clinging loses your true self. Thus, to have no body is not to abandon the body, but simply not to possess it. If you do not possess the body, how much less the world? The sage does not abandon the world, but treats it as entrusted, as borrowed, without possessing it. Favor and disgrace—why should I be alarmed by such things?\"\n\nGuo Zhiquan said: \"In the *Liezi*, the chapter where a man from Zheng obtains a deer illustrates that those who do not know the Dao err in matters of gain and loss, taking delusion for reality. The one who truly caught the deer mistook it for a dream and lost it. Another, hearing his deluded words, obtained it—and both took their gain and loss as real. Yet neither knew that what was gained or lost was not genuine, so the magistrate ordered it divided. Thus, all fortuitous gains and losses are like dreams—why then be deluded into alarm by favor and disgrace?\"\n\nThe Master said: \"Most people do not recognize dreams. The Patriarch said: 'If in a dream you recognize the dream-body, you are free and have reached the other shore.' Dreams have roots, and thought is their root. Thoughts have truth and falsehood, and dreams follow accordingly, like shadows clinging to form. Not only are night dreams dreams—every thought is a dream. What distinguishes truth from falsehood? Only that which does not harm virtue, power, spirit, or qi is true; all else is false and delusory. Even sages have thoughts, yet in responding to the ten thousand thoughts, they never lose their truth, for truth is their root.\"\n\nThe Master’s father said: \"Responding to thoughts as they arise, with no obstruction—this comes from having a root.\" Those who know the Dao, whether slandered or praised, favored or disgraced, undergo a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations without their hearts ever stirring. Why? Because they have seen through this dream-illusion.\n\nIt is said: \"In dreams, the six destinies are vividly clear; upon waking, the great thousand worlds are empty.\" The *Liezi*’s tale of the man from Zheng who obtained a deer speaks only of gaining and losing in delusion—this is nothing but a warning against having a mind attached to things.\n\nThe Master said: \"When grain first sprouts, from the moment it sends forth shoots and spreads leaves until it ears, it may all be called grain. Yet only when it forms kernels does it attain the substance of grain. Harvested and stored, transformed into food, able to become seed again—this is the true use of grain. However, some sprouts do not ear, some ears do not form kernels. If left unweeded, they fail to mature; if forced to grow, they are harmed—both lose the Way. Only by planting and weeding at the proper time, awaiting their natural completion, do they succeed.\n\nLearners, from the initial stage to the attainment of the Dao, may all be called 'on the Way,' yet only when they enter the true Dao do they attain its substance. Some, through laziness, stop halfway; others, through haste, harm themselves. Even those without such excess or deficiency may nurture what they have gained without reaching true realization. Or, unable to conceal and await the proper time, they boast and display themselves, becoming teachers and models. A little light scatters, never to be regained—this is what is meant by 'sprouting but not ear-ring, ear-ring but not forming kernels.'\"\n\nWhen the lecture reached the chapter \"Seen yet not visible,\" the Master said: \"Understanding this chapter’s meaning is precisely the practice of our own teaching. Master Danyang fully embodied the ancient Dao of non-action. As for Master Changchun, he taught people to accumulate merit and practice, preserving non-action while engaging in action. He took the ancient Dao as his guiding principle to govern all present circumstances.\"\n\nThe scripture says: \"One who knows the ancient beginning holds the thread of the Dao.\" All learners must first take hold of their own Dao-nature as their guiding principle, then accumulate merit and practice to respond to conditions—there is nothing they cannot apply. Master Danyang said: \"From the non-action heart arises compassionate mind; true practice and true merit all belong to it.\" When merit and practice reach completion, the heart-ground naturally awakens, and the sages grant them the Dao.\n\nYet why do those with merit often harbor a mind that relies on their practice, expecting the Dao in return? If they can forget even this mind, they attain 'acting without attachment.'\"",

After three years of this, his past karma was finally exhausted.\"\n\n\"Those who seek the Dao must understand this principle.\"",

      "translated_text": "The painter of the crane was none other than the transformed body of Pure Yang. As for Ma Ziran, he had known the Dao from an early age, practicing austerities and cultivating diligently, yet by sixty-four he had still not attained realization. One day, in a fit of resolve, he prepared to drown himself in a river to cast off his body. Suddenly, someone appeared and said: \"Your merit and practice are already complete—only this one step remains.\" Thereupon they stopped him, and indeed, after a hundred days, he completed the Dao.\n\nLooking at these two masters, one followed the way of non-action, the other the way of action. To clarify the true meaning of non-action and action is truly difficult to distinguish. What matters is that merit and practice reach fulfillment, and attainment will naturally follow.\n\nThe Master once said of himself: \"When I first set my resolve to learn the Dao, I grasped my heart-mind and inwardly observed it, reaching a state of such utter stillness that even the most spiritually attuned ghosts and gods could not perceive me. Yet suddenly, a single stray thought arose, uncontrollable and beyond all effort to restrain. There is no other reason for this—only that my merit and practice were still lacking. Had they been complete, the sages would have come to guide me. Let no learner doubt this.\"\n\nHere ends the discourse on the chapter *\"Of Old, Those Skilled in Being Scholars.\"*\n\nThe Master said: \"The principles have been thoroughly analyzed, yet their application remains unexhausted. Long ago, the venerable Master Wang of Xianyang, well-versed in the scriptures and teachings, once came to the hall. I asked him: 'What text are you studying today?' He replied: *'The Avataṃsaka Sūtra.'* I bade him expound its meaning. Then I said: 'Every sentence holds wondrous application, yet it is a pity that you can expound but not yet clarify it.'\n\nThis chapter serves as a great admonition for those who study the Dao: one must guard against the flaw of holding the Dao while wishing to remain unknown. If others come to know of it, harm will follow. Like hiding pearls and jade, carelessness invites theft; one must be vigilant and hesitant, like crossing ice in winter, ever fearful of loss, ever fearful of discovery. Thus, one must be as wary as if surrounded by neighbors, solemn as a guest, never daring to act recklessly—this is vigilance in externals.\n\nYet one must also be as fluid as melting ice, as uncarved as raw wood, as open as an empty valley—this speaks of the inner nature. Guarding the outer while protecting the inner, one still preserves the old to avoid becoming new, all to achieve the great completion. Thus the scripture says: *Great vessels are late in completion.*\n\nToday’s learners, if they possess even a glimmer of illumination, become self-satisfied and fear others will not know. Unable to firmly preserve the old, they are like what Yuyang called 'wildflowers.' At the outset, learning the Dao seems easy to attain, but the deeper one probes, the harder it is to perceive.\n\nLong ago, a Daoist from afar wished to come to the mountain and bow before the hall. Before arriving, no one lacked reverence, imagining all within the hall to be realized adepts. Yet upon arrival and meeting them, after only a short while, seeing nothing particularly extraordinary, their reverence waned. Little did they know that the deeper one probes, the harder it is to perceive a person—this is why the profound cannot be recognized.\n\nThe Master often engaged in casual conversation with others, speaking of mundane matters for days on end. Those who heard it for the first time could not help but be astonished. Amidst the busyness of worldly affairs, the Master attended to each task personally, even peeling hemp. The disciples in the hall called him 'Old Man Qiu.'\n\nMaster Shan once harbored doubts and asked me about this. I replied: 'One cannot judge a realized person by their words or trivial actions. Once the nature of the Dao is attained, in responding to the world, though one may speak all day, it is as if one has not spoken at all. When speech ends, one returns to their nature—is this not like how the turbid, over time, slowly clears, and the tranquil, over time, slowly stirs to life? How could it be like worldly people who force themselves to speak of the Dao while their inner minds unknowingly harbor mundane thoughts?'\n\nThose who study the Dao differ in this: their original resolve is for the Dao. In all worldly affairs, they act as they move, laboring without refusal. Since one cannot yet escape daily worldly tasks, how can one shirk such merit and practice? Yet once the task is done, all is forgotten, and one returns to the nature of learning the Dao. If even the slightest trace lingers, Chan Buddhists call this 'abiding in form.' What matters is that the heart of the Dao be weighty. When the heart of the Dao is weighty, though external conditions may be many, all will be subdued.\n\nPracticing in this way naturally aligns with the great purport of the scripture. Its five thousand words, whether stated directly or in reverse, aim only to lead one to see the Dao. One should combine the eighty-one chapters into a single chapter, then reduce that chapter to a single sentence, and that sentence to a single word. Even that word must be cast aside and returned to swiftly—for it is not the Dao that can be spoken.\"\n\nHere ends the discourse on the chapter *\"Attain the Utmost of Emptiness.\"*\n\nZhiquan again said: \"The phrase *'In stillness for a day, one returns to the mandate'*—I still cannot fathom its depths. May I ask for further instruction?\"\n\nThe Master replied: \"There is no principle in the scriptural teachings that is not clear—only the matter of *xing* and *ming* is difficult to understand. Long ago, Li the Daoist from Shandong was skilled in discoursing on the subtleties of principle. People called him 'Elder Li,' and he was a companion in the Dao to the barefoot Master Liu. One day, he asked me: 'Does a person’s nature come from the father or the mother?' I gave him a casual answer, for it is indeed difficult to explain. Later, at fifty-eight, Li still harbored doubts and thus withdrew to return to lay life.\n\nThus it is known that learning the Dao requires thorough investigation of principle, yet one must not seek it excessively. Excessive seeking is like the overgrowth of plants—endless and chaotic.\n\nI recall Master Meng, who was convalescing at Pingyu Hermitage. One day, he went out and saw a pregnant woman drawing water. Meng bowed to her and said: 'I am about to die and shall be reborn through you—you will be my mother.' The woman, hearing this, fled in alarm. Not many days later, he indeed passed away. The woman gave birth to a girl whose crown bore the faint mark of a cap. She was named Meng Xian and is now five years old.\n\nAlso, the father of my uncle in the Dao, Yu the Official, once lived in the mountain hall. He dreamed of wandering through a place of pavilions and terraces, where the beauty of the flowers and plants was beyond anything in the human realm. Further on stood a pavilion where several immortals sat playing chess. A young attendant held a chess piece and stood by.\"",

      "translated_text": "Yu bowed and offered his respects, inviting the immortals to let his attendant ascend. Observing Yu’s longing gaze, the immortals then entrusted the boy to his care and departed. Yu awoke with a start—at that very hour, his wife had given birth to a son. Later, when the boy was fifteen or sixteen, he showed no fondness for worldly affairs. Though married, he lived apart from his wife for three years, and his kin sought to censure him severely. Only then did his father recall the dream of that day and allowed the boy to follow his inclinations. After his father’s death, he met Master Danyang and left the household life.\n\nFrom this we may ask: is a person’s nature truly received from the father, or from the mother? Does it enter before the fetus is formed, or after? Yet there are also those conceived through a mother’s perception—stepping into a giant’s footprint, or the case of Duanmu of Guzhu—such are the natural workings of true responsiveness. To exhaustively trace their origins is impossible.\n\nThe Master once said: “The phrase ‘leisurely contemplating karmic conditions’—the word ‘leisurely’ carries profound meaning. Though a practitioner may not yet fully grasp the principle, they must simply refrain from doubt. One should only accumulate virtuous deeds and amass merit; the Dao resides therein. Never deceive Heaven, never wrong others. Form a bond with those who have attained the Dao, and deepen it to the utmost. In this life and the next, they will guide you to completion.”\n\nThe Master also said: “My bond with the Patriarch has always been deep. In the days at Pan Brook, I was forbidden to eat salt and not allowed to sleep before midnight. Even in trivial matters, I received his guidance. One night in a dream, I saw the Patriarch seated with an infant on his lap, about a hundred days old. Upon waking, I felt a stirring in my heart and knew my Dao-nature was still shallow. Half a year later, I dreamed the same scene, but the child was now about two years old. Awakening, I realized my Dao-nature had gradually grown. Later, I found myself free of evil thoughts. A year passed, and the dream recurred—the boy was now three or four, able to walk and stand on his own. After that, I no longer saw him, for I knew the guidance had continued until I could stand firm on my own.\n\nIf one wholeheartedly seeks the Dao, they will surely encounter a perfected being to awaken them. Yet without true merit and sincere practice, such an encounter cannot occur. For every fraction of merit a cultivator accumulates, their heart gains a fraction of peace and clarity. In all matters, one must weigh and respond. When great honor or disgrace arises—things others find hard to bear, or that the world cannot tolerate—one who can lightly let them pass, who can endure, accept, and embrace, has truly ‘dissolved’ them. This is the blessing of practicing the Dao.\n\nPractitioners should remember this crucial point: do not seek it through cleverness or force. If the Dao could be attained by strength of will or intellect, then the strong-willed and powerful would all achieve it—but such a principle does not exist.”\n\nThe Master expounded three chapters: *The Great Dao in Decline*, *Abandoning Sagacity*, and *Discarding Wisdom*. He said: “Every word of the scriptural teachings is a wondrous function. Only when one’s heart already holds this principle will what they hear resonate deeply. If the heart lacks it beforehand, the teachings cannot enter.\n\nThe meaning of these three chapters is this: as the Dao and qi declined, the sages established teachings suited to the times. Since the loss of the Dao, we have relied on virtue; when virtue waned, we turned to ritual—all unavoidable responses. Consider the Quanzhen school: the teachings of Master Danyang differ greatly from those of Master Changchun, yet this too is unavoidable. Confucius taught benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom—but was his Dao truly limited to these? The sages embraced the Dao yet did not abandon benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom, for these were needed to address the times. Once their purpose was served, they returned to the Dao.\n\nThe cultivator inwardly preserves their true nature. In benevolence, they act with benevolence; in righteousness, with righteousness; in propriety, with propriety; in wisdom, with wisdom—yet never lose their true nature. Amidst the world’s decline, they alone can return to antiquity. Practitioners need only inwardly guard their true nature, responding to all circumstances without attachment. Though I live in this age, I have never failed to preserve my true nature. Even in dreams, I still wear my novice’s robe, transforming worldly tasks into alms-food. Though leaving the household life does not exempt one from worldly conditions, as long as one never forgets their Dao-nature, there will surely be a future. If one dedicates this life single-mindedly to the Dao, even if reborn, they will still be a devoted practitioner.\n\nYet some who leave the household today do not reflect on this principle. They seek to place themselves above others, fearing only the loss of their superficial reputation. Before others, they close their eyes and clasp their hands in a posture of ‘sitting in forgetfulness’; when no one is watching, they do as they please. Though they call themselves Daoists—are they truly Daoists?”\n\nThe Master concluded the chapter *Cutting Off Learning Brings No Sorrow*, saying: “Learning is not difficult; cutting off learning is difficult.” He recalled the *Ten Exhortations* of Chan Master Ma, the fourth of which reads:\n\n*I exhort you, fourth: Broad learning and much hearing prick the heart.\nForget feelings, exhaust perceptions, and cease all striving—\nThen whatever you grasp will be without error.*\n\nWhen feelings are forgotten and perceptions exhausted, there is no striving or seeking. It is because of feelings that views arise; if not striving, then one is grasping. The scripture says: *See the plain, embrace the uncarved; lessen self-interest, reduce desires.* The “plain” refers to one’s inherent portion; recognizing it, one embraces the uncarved. “Self-interest” refers to personal bias; “desires” to craving. Self-interest cannot be entirely eliminated, but by lessening it, desires diminish.\n\nThe sages expounded at length to make these principles known so that people might practice them. Yet those who neither know nor study remain ignorant; those who study but do not practice what they know waste their efforts. The wise who do not act—how far are they from the foolish? ‘Excess is as bad as deficiency’—this is precisely what it means.\n\nThose without learning do not understand the meaning of the sacred texts and often despise those who do.

      "translated_text": "Yet scholars may encounter points where principles and meanings resist clear resolution—these should be set aside for the moment. What cannot be grasped now may come naturally later. To recognize one’s own ignorance is already a form of knowing. Confucius said: *“To say you know when you know, and to say you do not know when you do not—this is true knowing.”* One must not pretend to knowledge by force. The scripture’s words *Cutting off learning brings no sorrow* warn against those who, though learned, cannot forget their learning—such people will have sorrow. If the saying meant that learning itself should be abandoned, why would the sages have spoken five thousand words?\n\nThough a Daoist may not have extensively studied the *Yinfu*, *Daode*, and *Qingjing* scriptures, how could one not study them at all? Let us discuss the chapter *“The Bearing of Great Virtue.”* The Master said: I recall our teacher once asking us, *“Which among the scriptural teachings comes closest to the Dao?”* Shan-gong first answered with what he had realized, while I replied with this chapter. *“The Valley Spirit does not die”—*its profundities are hard to perceive, yet this chapter alone suffices for practice. *“Vague! Elusive! Within it there are images.”* When one’s practice reaches this point, they will see for themselves.\n\nThough the Dao is obscure and difficult to perceive, what *can* be seen is virtue. When applied to things, it becomes meritorious action; traced to its source, it truly arises from the Dao. Manifest in benevolence, concealed in function—Dao, virtue, merit, and action all share a single origin. There has never been one without the mind of Dao who possessed true virtue. Even those at the initial stage of practice can discern this: who has the mind of Dao, and who does not. All things, good and bad, naturally reveal themselves. Thus, when pointing them out, one might say, *“By this you may see,”*—it is not difficult.\n\nThe text also says: *“Within it there is essence; that essence is most real.”* These words have endured from ancient times to the present, for it is by this supreme essence that all beings are transformed and born. Therefore, in learning the Dao, one must not allow even the slightest dust-like thought to arise, lest the spirit scatter and dissipate.\n\nThere is a saying in Chan: A woman riding in a cart passed by a gate, and a monk, chancing to see her, fixed his gaze upon her. The cart then grew heavier, for his spirit had already been carried away by it. Master Yuyang spoke even more directly: *“Those who cling too deeply to things will destroy their own nature.”* Our teacher also said: The vital essence in a person’s corpse may, after many years in the coffin, transform into a *wangliang*—is this not a kind of luminosity? Thus we know that a person’s light is dispersed among things. Consider a bowl of water poured into a hundred bowls—none can be completely emptied, each retaining some moisture, yet the original water is gone.\n\nA person’s light must not be scattered. When the light is great, the nature is great; when the light is small, the nature is small. Using this light to examine others, nothing false escapes detection. But if one can turn the light inward to illuminate oneself, then the light remains entirely within. Only those of resolute will can grasp and preserve it, preventing its loss.\n\nYet without the support of true practice and solid conduct, transformation cannot occur. Someone once asked our teacher about this, and he replied: *“Cultivate hidden virtue outwardly, and inwardly secure the spirit.”* Thus we know that even with spirit, without merit and action, the Dao cannot be attained. However, when performing good deeds for others or for things, one must not harbor a sense of reliance or entitlement. Our teacher had a poem:\n\n*Do not ask how the celestial mechanism works,*\n*Only cultivate hidden virtue and recite the long watch.*\n*Human sentiments, though fickle, are all the path of immortals—*\n*In daily practice, exert yourself to the utmost.*\n\nIf there is even the slightest sense of reliance, it is called “attachment to form,” and the merit diminishes.\n\nWe also know that non-action and action have no fixed form. Non-action that clings to something becomes action; action that clings to nothing becomes non-action. How could there be a fixed form?\n\nThe Master said: Many people use their own light to illuminate the faults of others, leaving nothing unexamined, yet if they could turn that light back upon themselves, they would no longer dare to see the faults of others. Our teacher, whenever he saw someone’s fault and wished to instruct them, would always begin by saying: *“We are all beings of the same nature.”* Only then would he speak of their fault. His meaning was that he and the other shared the nature of sentient beings, and as one who had awakened first, he sought to awaken those who followed. His way of teaching was so thorough.\n\nFor those of middling or lesser capacity, he would clearly point out the way, but for those with spiritual discernment, he would merely hint at the meaning and let them realize it themselves. Since following my teacher, I have observed his every movement, silence, and word—all were teachings, depending only on how the student responded. If one truly investigates and devotes oneself, progress will naturally follow.\n\nToday’s learners should examine themselves and not scrutinize the faults of others. By practicing in this way, one will gradually gain realization.\n\nThe Master said: I have heard that teaching requires adaptability, using expedient means to transform others—yet this may risk losing the truth. I have always embodied my teacher’s words, none of which were not grounded in reality. He often said: *“My mind knows expedient means, but my mouth cannot express it.”* I once discussed this with Master Wanyan. At first, we spoke of expedient means, but over time, it became habitual speech, turning into ordinary words without our realizing it, and the mind followed suit. This is something learners must deeply guard against.\n\nThe Master said: Learning the Dao lies entirely in a single thought. When that thought arises, it is progress; when it lapses, it is regression. Only by advancing without cease is one truly learning the Dao. Consider the hundred crafts and skills, or any practical endeavor—they all require arrangement and preparation before they can be done. Learning the Dao requires no such arrangement or preparation. It is simply a matter of clarifying the mind and dispelling desires, and one can practice at any time, in any place—whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down; in cold or heat; living with others or alone—there is no situation where it cannot be done.\n\nLearners must seize the moment and take up the task, just as the predecessors would grasp a single word and practice it.",

      "translated_text": "Those who often cling to fixed notions—saying, \"I will begin at such-and-such a time,\" or \"I will comprehend at such-and-such a time\"—day after day, their resolve and qi gradually wane, and they ultimately achieve nothing.\n\nThe lecture on the chapters *\"The One Who Stands on Tiptoe Cannot Stand Firm\"* and *\"There Is a Thing, Formlessly Formed\"* concludes.\n\nThe Master said: The world possesses its natural principles, yet most people remain unaware of them. Those who know will never act contrary to nature. Affairs are either true or false—this distinction must be made clear. Those who have not yet awakened mock falsehood with falsehood, never realizing their own delusion. The learner of the Dao first discerns truth and falsehood within the mind and nature. Whether in moments of attainment or non-attainment, one uses the scriptures as proof, aligning the scriptures with one’s nature. When the mind and scriptures merge, one remains free from delusion for life.\n\nMaster Yuyang initially did not read books, yet his words accorded with the scriptures—this was because he grasped their essence. Today, some deeply understand the words of the scriptures but do not know their root. Clinging to the language of the ancients, they become even more confused. The ancients’ words are not mere words—they are words beyond words. If one only grasps the subtlety of their language but fails to apply it wondrously to one’s own nature, it is entirely useless.\n\nIn learning the Dao, only when one recognizes the mind, sees the nature, and attains true emptiness does one truly succeed. One must exert every effort in practice. Master Yuyang once said:\n*\"Since meeting the companion of true emptiness,\nI have cast aside all worldly passions.\"*\n\nMaster Changsheng once wrote a hundred and twenty *Ruizhegu* poems in a single brushstroke, one of which reads:\n*\"Before the inner heart verifies, the heart of form is a demon—\nThe tighter you grasp, the more thoughts multiply.\"*\n\nMaster Danyang said: *\"Tightly grasping, tightly seizing gives rise to fivefold brilliance,\"* which perfectly matches this.\n\nMaster Changsheng said: Before attaining true emptiness, the more you try to grasp, the more thoughts multiply. Master Danyang said: Once true emptiness is attained, the inner content unfolds, and one must apply effort to hold it fast—hence *\"tightly grasping, tightly seizing gives rise to fivefold brilliance.\"*\n\nMaster Changchun’s *Yaolishengmie* lyric reads:\n*\"Having attained the celestial jewel of nature,\nI see through the spring flowers and autumn moon.\"*\nThis is the realm of true emptiness. It further states:\n*\"In times of exhaustion,\nGhosts cannot summon you—\nOnly the immortals can uplift you.\"*\n\nEarlier, it spoke of *\"tempering body and mind a hundredfold,\"* then of *\"attaining the celestial jewel of nature,\"* yet it still speaks of *\"only the immortals can uplift you.\"* Who but one of utmost truth and sincerity would dare utter such words? The Chan school takes true emptiness as complete realization and often mocks these lines, asking: *\"If one has already attained the celestial jewel of nature, why still speak of immortals uplifting you?\"* I say they truly do not understand.\n\nThe *Qian* hexagram speaks of six dragons: At *Initial Nine*, *\"The hidden dragon does not act\"*—firm and unshakable. At *Nine Two*, *\"The dragon appears in the field\"*—its radiance naturally manifests. At *Nine Three*, *\"All day long, vigilant and cautious, as if in peril\"*—only then does one avoid blame. At *Nine Four*, one draws near to the heights and communes with the divine, sometimes ascending, sometimes descending, now hidden, now visible—hence *\"perhaps leaping in the abyss.\"* Leaping is ascending; in the abyss is returning below. In this state of vagueness and obscurity, one still requires the uplifting of sages and worthies. Only at *Nine Five* does one attain boundless transformation. Before this, one must temper body and mind a hundredfold, and only then, with the uplifting of immortals, can one reach this stage.\n\nIf learners of the Dao do not first temper body and mind a hundredfold but instead seek the Dao directly, how can they possibly attain it? Master Yuyang once said: *\"A Daoist refused to cultivate, claiming, ‘I practice non-action.’ Recklessly indulging himself, he provoked the authorities and was beaten to death. He waited to practice non-action, yet non-action struck him dead instead.\"* He also spoke of two kinds of seeing the nature and two kinds of true emptiness. *\"Realizing that all things are illusory and empty, yet knowing one’s own nature is true—this is also seeing the nature. Once known, one must practice it. Through practice to its utmost, one sees the nature again. Initially awakening to the Dao is true emptiness; reaching the ultimate point is also true emptiness. Only when true emptiness is attained and merit and practice are complete does the Dao’s blackness naturally burst through. The Dao’s qi resides in the nine apertures of the body, closing them effortlessly. Only at this stage does one truly enjoy its benefits.\"*\n\n*\"One hand grasps mine,\nOne hand points to the void—\nThree horizontal, one vertical, two like this:\nNo gate, no door,\nFour directions, eight reaches,\nThis is the realm of the Primordial Beginning.\nIf the nature of sentient beings is not yet exhausted,\nAnd one relies on the mind’s power to block the nine apertures,\nThen left closes while right opens,\nMutually disrupting, uncontrollable.\"*\n\nThese words were never lightly disclosed; today, they are specially revealed. I have received them with reverence. All this pertains to the nature of humanity—only because people fail to preserve and guard it do they not reach this realm. At the first glimmer of light, they refuse to humble themselves, becoming arrogant and self-satisfied, seeking to distinguish themselves from others—thus they cannot achieve great illumination. Just as water gathers more deeply the lower it flows, so too does the accumulation of virtue in a person. Those who have truly attained something should conceal it even more deeply. If one carelessly reveals even a single word, the loss is no small matter.\n\nIt is like those in the world who endure countless hardships to accumulate wealth, yet through a single moment of carelessness, they offend others unjustly. Once the matter escalates, their wealth is spent in a single day—how great is the loss! Thus it is said: *\"Accumulation is difficult, but preservation is even more so.\"* Only by preserving oneself, recognizing that beyond one’s nature all things are illusory, detesting them like filth, and regarding them as leftovers or superfluous growths—only then has one truly reached the state of nature.\n\nIf one does not truly know that superfluity is ugly but instead adds a head upon a head, claiming, *\"This is what I possess, what others lack,\"* boasting and praising oneself without self-awareness—how can such a person hope to understand the Dao of nature? It is truly difficult.\n\nThe lecture on the chapter *\"He Who Knows Others Is Wise\"* concludes.\n\nThe Master said: The scriptures state, *\"He who dies yet does not perish is long-lived.\"* The meaning is perfectly clear.",

Even in death, I truly consider them undying.\n\nHe also said: *\"He who conquers himself is strong,\"* and *\"He who acts with strength has resolve.\"* For those who cultivate the Dao, subduing the heart and advancing in practice, resolve must be their foundation. Without resolve, even a single unpalatable meal will not settle in the chest—meaning the myriad spirits will not accept it. But those with resolve, though given only coarse food, will not suffer illness. When resolve is mighty, the myriad spirits follow, and even things change in response, so that one no longer perceives the bitterness of taste.\n\nHumans possess myriad spirits, yet without resolve, they cannot be led. When great resolve is put into action, it is like a great general marching forth—all the qi of the body assists it. What then cannot be overcome? Mencius said: *\"Resolve is the general of qi.\"* I have practiced this with great efficacy, and thus believe it all the more.\n\nThe scriptures say: *\"He who does not lose his place endures.\"* The word *\"place\"* is like that in the story of Zichan ordering the warden to raise fish, where the warden replied, *\"They have found their place!\"* The words of the scriptures are meant first to be understood, then applied for one’s own use. If one clings to the words without putting them into practice, they become a hindrance instead.\n\nYet the scriptures often repeat themselves in varied ways, and it is most important that one grasp this. They say, *\"He who acts with strength has resolve,\"* but also, *\"Weaken your resolve.\"* They say, *\"To learn is wrong,\"* but also, *\"Not to learn is wrong.\"* They say, *\"Stillness is wrong,\"* but then, *\"Movement is also wrong.\"* Such reversals and shifts have no fixed meaning.

      "translated_text": "The chapter *\"Holding the Great Image\"* is expounded here, drawing from various scholars’ interpretations. Among them, Su Ziyou states: *\"The Great Image is the insipid, the Dao that transcends sight and sound, beyond what the eyes and ears can perceive.\"* To grasp this Dao above is to ensure that all under heaven will come to you—like the allure of sweet bait or the art of governance. A fleeting good government may indeed draw people close, like travelers pausing at an inn, yet it cannot endure.\n\nThe Master remarked: *\"Those who explain the scriptures and awaken to the root of the Dao do so without wasted words—Ziyou’s insight is apt.\"* Zhuangzi likewise said: *\"Benevolence and righteousness are but the temporary lodgings of the former kings.\"* This is the same idea.\n\nZhiquan noted: *\"The annotations to Chapter Fifty-Four often follow the *Zhenghe* edition, which frequently cites the *Book of Changes* and *Zhuangzi.*\"*\n\nThe Master replied: *\"The Three Mysteries are fundamentally one. Emperor Huizong of Song possessed an innate affinity for the Dao, hence his reliance on them. To know this is not difficult; to practice it is the true challenge. When I first entered the Daoist gate, I saw only the virtue practiced by the elders. Later, upon penetrating this scripture, I realized it was all the path they had walked before. Today, all external affairs in the teaching are no different from using sweet bait to detain passing travelers—one must not cling to them. One should relinquish the path trodden by those before, yet not lose its essence. Those who now advance in their Daoist practice do not suffer the hardships of worldly people, and this must have its causes. They did not arrive here by chance. If one seeks the root of this, it is truly found in the study of the Dao—how could one ever forget it for a single day?\"*\n\nWith this, the lecture on *\"The Highest Virtue Does Not Act as Virtue\"* concluded.\n\nThe Master said: *\"The scripture states: ‘The highest virtue does not act as virtue, and thus possesses virtue; the lesser virtue does not lose sight of virtue, and thus lacks virtue.’ Applying this to the affairs practiced within the teaching makes it readily apparent. One who quietly accumulates merit and conduct without seeking recognition does not regard it as virtue. Since one does not claim virtue for oneself, this is called the highest virtue. Not making others aware of it may seem as though one has lost virtue, yet I say: when virtue is concealed, it becomes all the more present—is this not truly possessing virtue? Thus, it is said, ‘and thus possesses virtue.’ If one’s merit and conduct are made known to others, it may seem as though one has not lost virtue, but this is lesser virtue. Once others know, they will inevitably show reverence, and one’s virtue gradually diminishes. Thus, it is said, ‘and thus lacks virtue.’ If merit and conduct are used to cultivate fame, they will dissipate with time—how can they be applied to the emptiness of the Dao? What, then, is truly one’s own?\"*\n\nThe lecture on *\"The Dao Gives Birth to the One\"* followed.\n\nThe Master said: *\"The Way of the sages is fundamentally simple. Few learners attain clarity in this principle, for they cannot forget their daily pursuits and self-nature. Whatever does not align with the sages is merely one’s own disposition. One must utterly cast aside this self-nature to naturally harmonize with the sages’ ‘Dao giving birth to the One.’ In Chan practice, when one reaches this point, it is true thoroughness. Yet if one cannot stabilize here, other complications arise. Master Shao Yaofu once said: ‘Look upon the wind’s howl and the night’s chill—who stands firm at the gate?’ I have often reflected: profound and wondrous teachings should not be shown to the masses, for those of middling or lesser capacity who hear them often misapply them. In the past, there was one who studied the Nature School with great clarity yet disregarded the precepts, doing as he pleased. A realized master asked: ‘Is this not a seed for hell?’ The man replied: ‘What harm does this do to the Dao?’ Such is the extent of its corruption.\"*",
      "overlap_context": "\"He who acts with strength has resolve,\"* but also, *\"Weaken your resolve.\"* They say, *\"To learn is wrong,\"* but also, *\"Not to learn is wrong.\"* They say, *\"Stillness is wrong,\"* but then, *\"Movement is also wrong.\"* Such reversals and shifts have no fixed meaning. They are meant to guard against excess or deficiency in the learner, lest one cling to one side. Thus, they guide from both left and right, leading one to stand upon the central Way. This is what the learner must deeply investigate.",

      "translated_text": "The chapter on *\"In governing people and serving Heaven, nothing surpasses frugality\"* is expounded as follows.\n\nThe Master said: *Frugality* (啬) means cherishing care—cherishing the Dao. This is the daily practice of the learner. This single word is the essence of the entire chapter. *Taking* (服) means consuming, and *taking early* (早服) means savoring the flavor of the Dao. *Accumulating virtue in abundance* (重积德) begins with diminishing the self to benefit others, extending to governing people and serving Heaven. When the function of the Dao is fully realized, it penetrates Heaven and Earth. Thus, in learning the Dao, accumulating virtue is the great foundation. Only with true virtue can one savor its flavor—what Daoists call *reaping its benefits*. Learners all know that when the mind is free of杂念 and the qi flows harmoniously, this is *reaping the benefits*. Yet few truly taste its flavor, for they do not know the importance of accumulating virtue. Without true merit and virtue as the root, there is nothing to be gained. Even if one exhausts the mind in striving, whether for a year, ten years, or even a hundred, there will ultimately be no attainment. When merit and virtue are accumulated, one does not seek attainment yet attains naturally.\n\nWhat is *true merit and virtue*? It is acting without reliance, not considering one’s own virtue as virtue—this is true merit and virtue.\n\nThe chapter on *\"Acting through non-action\"* is expounded as follows.\n\nThe Master said: The scripture states, *\"Repay resentment with virtue.\"* The sages speak of what is most difficult for people in the world. If even repaying resentment is done with virtue, then in all other matters, virtue is surely applied. Yet people of the world cannot practice this; they return resentment with resentment, never ceasing, until calamity becomes inescapable. The sages seek to sever its source, hence this particular teaching. If learners can grasp this principle, how can resentment ever arise?\n\nThe chapter on *\"He who is brave in daring will be killed; he who is brave in not daring will live\"* is discussed by various schools, some emphasizing benefit, others harm. One view holds that bravery in not daring brings benefit, while bravery in daring brings harm. Su Ziyou’s general interpretation states: *\"Not daring leads to life; daring leads to death—this is the great constant of natural principle.\"* Yet sometimes the daring survive, and the cautious perish—these are exceptions. The world then gambles on these exceptions, neglecting the constant principle. Observing Heaven through the eyes and ears, seeing only its curvature and not its wholeness, none fail to doubt the coarseness of Heaven’s net and its many omissions. Only by grasping its beginning and end, exhausting its transformations, can one know its vastness—though coarse, it does not err.\n\nThe Master said: Ziyou’s explanation is apt. Who knows the causes of these exceptions? The causes of benefit or harm are such that even sages find them difficult to fathom. *Difficult* here implies doubt. (Alternatively, *difficult* may be read in the departing tone for greater clarity.) Though doubted, there is ultimately no room for skepticism. My teaching speaks of *cause and effect*: if a person possesses even a fraction of goodness, yet their karmic obstructions remain unresolved, though the reward may not manifest immediately—even after a hundred or a thousand lifetimes—once the obstructions are dissolved, that fraction of blessing will be received. The same applies to evil. Viewed in its totality, it is like Heaven’s net—vast and all-encompassing. Good and evil are inevitably repaid without omission; thus, though coarse, it does not err.\n\n*Record of the Northern Teachings of Master Qinghe, Volume Four—Concluded.*",
