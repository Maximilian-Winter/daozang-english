  "full_translation": "The Imperial *Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n*Masters Division, Volume 14*\n*Explication of the* Zhouyi Cantong Qi\n*Daoist School* · *Abstract*\n\nWe, your ministers, respectfully observe: The *Explication of the* Zhouyi Cantong Qi *in three juan* was composed by Chen Xianwei of the Song dynasty. Xianwei, styled Zongdao and self-styled Baoyi Zi, was a native of Huaiyang and a Daoist of the Yousheng Abbey in Lin’an during the Jiading and Duanping eras. This work was published in the first year of the Duanping era by his disciple Wang Yi. Xianwei himself wrote the preface. The arrangement of the text follows that of Peng Xiao’s edition, and the \"Song of the Cauldron and Vessel,\" a single poem, is also appended at the end of the juan after Peng’s version. However, while the text is divided into three pian, it is not further subdivided into chapters, adhering instead to Ge Hong’s *Biographies of Divine Transcendents*. The seventy characters beginning with \"Resembling the midwinter node\" were placed under \"Branches, Stalks, and Leaves\" in both Peng’s edition and Chen Zhixun’s version, but in this edition, they are moved beneath the section \"The Flowing Pearl of Grand Yang.\" This rearrangement was made by Xianwei on the basis of the text’s separate discourse on the Four Images. At that time, theories of misplaced bamboo slips were in vogue, and figures such as Wang Bo successively fanned the flames, their waves of distortion extending even to esoteric arts.\n\nNevertheless, for its detailed and lucid exegesis, this work stands as one of the finer editions among the various commentaries on the *Cantong Qi*. Thus, it is preserved here as one of the schools of Inner Alchemy, much as Wu Cheng’s works are included among the explications of the classics.\n\nHumbly submitted in the tenth month of the forty-sixth year of the Qianlong reign.\n\n*Chief Compilers:*\nYour ministers Ji Yun, Lu Feixiong, Sun Shiyi\n*Chief Collators:*\nYour minister Lu Fei Chi\n\n*Original Preface to the* Explication of the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*\n\nNow, the completion of things...\n\nForms and images, though enduring, must eventually decay—yet Heaven and Earth do not decay, for they are the gathering of things. Essence and radiance, though lasting, must eventually disperse—yet the sun and moon do not disperse, for they are the adornment of things. Wood, fire, earth, and water, though substantial, must ultimately perish—yet true gold does not perish, for it is the essence of things. Sand, stone, grasses, and trees, though vital, may die—yet the true elixir does not die. Thus, Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, true gold, and the true elixir are all the most numinous of things. Therefore, the Daoist appellation of the Golden Elixir is not idly chosen. The Golden Elixir takes Heaven and Earth as its body and models the sun and moon in its function. Heaven and Earth are the sky and land of our bodies; Kan and Li are the sun and moon of our bodies. When Heaven and Earth ascend and descend, there are seasons; when Kan and Li unite, there is mechanism. The supreme treasure is refined, and once attained, it is attained forever—this is why it neither decays nor disperses, neither perishes nor dies.\n\nGreat indeed is the Way of the Golden Elixir! It encompasses emptiness and embraces the earth, transcends numbers and surpasses form—unlike the other three thousand six hundred schools of illusory arts, which can only gaze upon it from afar. The ancient sages revered the treasure of the Dao and feared its leakage to the unworthy, so they concealed it in their hearts and did not inscribe it on bamboo or silk. In the Later Han, Wei Boyang lamented the near-extinction of the great Dao and pitied the lack of teachers among aspiring scholars. Thus, he took the ancient text *Jinbi Longhu Jing* as his basis, borrowing its imagery and metaphors to expound and elaborate, unfolding the secrets of the elixir to enlighten the unenlightened. He titled it *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*. Its words are archaic, its meaning profound, and readers find it difficult to comprehend. Xu Congshi, Zhang Su, and Peng Zhenyi all once wrote commentaries on it, but of these, only Peng’s remains extant today. Though his exegesis is detailed, the true mechanism remains obscure. Recent vulgar interpretations have further appended heterodox methods, compounding Peng’s errors and misleading later learners—rendering it unworthy of study.\n\nMaster Chen of the Embracing Unity school, endowed with innate brilliance and penetrating insight into the origin of nature and destiny, encountered a perfected being in Duliang of Huai in the guiwei year of Jiading. There, he fully attained the true mechanism of the Golden Elixir. In the early years of Baoyou, he came to the capital, where, with a heart of compassion, he guided and uplifted later generations. Only then did he obtain the *Cantong Qi* and read it, resolving all doubts without remainder. Thereafter, he dismissed all companions and entered seclusion to cultivate and refine. After more than a year, his merit deepened and his Dao became ever more manifest. Thus, he set down in writing the teachings derived from his personal practice and realization. His explanations delve into the subtlest details, and his elucidations of meaning are effortless yet luminous—like Cai Mo’s discernment of the divine dragon or He Shi’s identification of true jade. The path of the elixir now has a reliable foundation.\n\nFormerly, Master Cheng of Yichuan said that the three most difficult things in the world are: governing a state to the point of praying for eternal mandate, nurturing the body to the point of longevity, and learning to the point of sagehood. Though their functions differ, their achievement is one—all capable of wresting control from creation. Yet the Master’s Dao does not merely nurture the body.\n\nIf later learners can thoroughly savor this work, delving deeply to attain realization for themselves, they will then understand that the Master’s so-called Dao transcends what words and texts can convey. As the *Yijing* says: *\"To divine the numinous and make it manifest depends on the person.\"* I have humbly listened to the Master’s teachings on the ultimate, and for a long time, I have been privy to his intent in writing. Here, I record his name: Chen Xianwei, styled Zongdao, later known as Shaowei. A native of Huaiyang, he is also called Master Embracing Unity. His works *Lisheng Pian*, *Xianwei Zhiyan*, and *Baoyizi Shu* circulate in the world.\n\nWritten in the summer, the fifth month, the first year of Duangping of the Song, by the Daoist of the Heavenly Wall of the Golden Flower Cave, Zheng Boqian, who bows reverently to inscribe this preface.\n\nGreat indeed is the Dao!\n\nThe workings of creation cannot be defied; the divine and sagely cannot fathom them. Heaven and Earth rely upon it to give life, yet even the sage cannot name it. It cannot be conceived by the heart, nor discussed in words; it cannot be known by wisdom, nor grasped by understanding. If one guards it with one’s nature, it remains as distant as heaven and abyss—how much more so for those who seek it with emotion?\n\nYet when the Dao gives birth to the One, and the One comes into being, the Dao may then be attained and its numinosity made manifest. The One is the undifferentiated thing formed before Heaven and Earth came to be. How great is the One! It is the mother of Heaven and Earth, the root of creation, the ancestor of the myriad things. Though all things possess this One, they ultimately cannot long endure. As Guan, the Gatekeeper, and Yin Xi said: \"Heaven and Earth establish the principle, and the One is contained within each thing. Every thing contains it—thus each thing, each body, possesses its own Heaven and Earth.\"\n\nMoreover, within the human body, yin and yang, nature and destiny, hun and po, waking and sleeping, movement and stillness, life and death—all these are dualities. Each possesses the One, yet where does it truly reside? Laozi said: \"When the One is attained, all affairs are complete.\" The One is the Golden Elixir. The Golden Elixir is the wondrous Dao of returning to the root, restoring the origin, reverting to the source, and recovering destiny. The Elixir guards the union of Qian and Kun, the clustering of Kan and Li, the harmony of yin and yang, the conjoining of male and female, causing the two to transform and return to the One. From this arise the Nine Palaces, the Eight Trigrams, the Seven Governors, the Six Positions, the Five Phases, the Four Images, and the Three Powers—all born of the two, yet all ultimately returning to the One.\n\nOnly then is the Elixir guarded. The \"gold\" in Golden Elixir refers to the extremity of the Five Phases. The Five Phases generate one another, reaching their culmination in metal. Heaven gives birth to water, water to wood, wood to fire, fire to earth, and earth to metal—metal is the last to be generated, completing the qi of the Five Phases and fulfilling the function of creation. Metal is a treasure: when smelted, it yields water; when struck, it yields fire. Its softness resembles wood, its color resembles earth. It encompasses the four natures of water, fire, earth, and wood. It endures ten thousand years without decay and grows ever harder through a hundred refinements. It is the ultimate treasure of pure yang, firm and strong. Heaven possesses pure yang, hence it is said that Qian is metal. The One possesses pure yang, hence it is called the Golden Elixir. The spirit possesses pure yang, hence it is called the Golden Immortal. Their principle is one.\n\nThe Buddhists speak of the four great elements—earth, water, fire, and wind—provisionally combined. Through cultivation, they attain the adamantine body and immeasurable longevity. Yet earth, water, fire, and wind correspond to earth, water, fire, and wood, which are not firm and thus easily decay. Only the firm and dense body is the indestructible vajra—this, too, is the same Dao. Hence the Elixir is named after gold.\n\nThe sages knew that the two could return to the One, and the One could return to the Dao. Thus they attained the principles of nine returns, seven reversions, eight reunions, six residences, the gathering of five, the clustering of four, the guarding of three, and the union of two. Broadly applied, this encompasses the 365 degrees of the celestial sphere, the twenty-eight lunar lodges, the seventy-two seasonal divisions, the twelve terrestrial branches, the eight solar terms, the four seasons—all that creation encompasses is harmonized within the function of the Golden Elixir. Who but the most divine and sagely of the world could know this? Though the celestial mechanism is secret, each generation has not lacked those who understand it. It lies in the subtlety of a single thought, which can move Heaven and Earth.\n\nIf a person’s good roots are pure and unified, their heart set on the Dao, and they abandon worldly affairs to seek liberation, diligently studying the true Dao, poring over the classics of immortals, exhausting the canons of sages, humbly seeking friends, and earnestly seeking teachers, they will surely encounter a perfected being who transmits the oral instructions. Those who are devoted to the Dao yet do not encounter such a teacher exist, but those who encounter one without devotion have never been known.\n\nThe true immortals and supreme sages have composed many scriptures to instruct later learners. Only Wei Boyang of the Eastern Han, basing his work on the *Yijing*, wrote the *Cantong Qi* in three chapters, which alone exhausts the mysteries of the profound and conveys the lifeblood of the ultimate Dao, expounding the marrow of the Great Elixir. In recent times, students of the Dao rarely see the ancient texts, but now that this book has been obtained, it may be called the ancestor of elixir scriptures. Its discussions are thorough and precise, concealing the celestial mechanism; its methods are subtle yet clearly displayed, arranging the images of the law.\n\nSince this scripture was written, commentators through the ages have been many, yet none have fully grasped Master Wei’s original intent. Zhang Ziyang deeply lamented that later generations, deluded and reckless, presumptuously annotated the sacred teachings of the former sages. He sighed at the errors in the commentaries on this book.\n\nAlas! The Great Medicine of the Golden Elixir is difficult to encounter, difficult to meet—it is not a worldly matter. What this book describes is most profound and secret, not a worldly method. If one has not met a perfected teacher or penetrated its depths, and merely relies on broad reading to recklessly interpret the sacred scriptures, will this not profane the lofty immortals, mislead later learners, and incur the shame of groundless fabrication?\n\nI have been fortunate to encounter a true teacher and have studied for many years. Each time I read this book, I admire its detailed and comprehensive exposition. After entering the chamber to undertake the great work, I have wandered among people, taking pleasure in visiting friends and meeting companions, discerning the worthy from the foolish, and examining the upright from the perverse. I grieve that in recent times, those who attain the Dao are rare, and those who awaken to the truth are few. Even when the celestial mechanism is revealed, it is not easily understood.\n\nTwo or three Daoist friends, hearing of this, urged me to annotate it, saying: \"This book has been obscure for a thousand years. The commentaries of various schools are not worth reading, and those who understand the Dao are rarely seen. If you do not annotate it, who will elucidate Master Wei’s teachings?\" I replied: \"Did not Master Wei say, 'Read it a thousand times, ten thousand times, and the numinous will naturally reveal itself to you'? It lies in the learner’s diligence—what need is there for superfluous words? Moreover, I am idle and indolent, passing my days in laziness. How could I find time for brush and ink?\"\n\nAfterward, these two or three friends would often discuss the Dao with me, citing one or two passages and asking for explanations. Over eight or nine years in Qiantang, I orally expounded the book without realizing it was nearly complete. One day, they recorded it and showed it to me, noting that a few sections were incomplete and asking me to fill them in to complete the earlier text, and also to write a preface. I commended their sincerity and casually added annotations, then wrote this preface on the Golden Elixir.\n\nWritten on the full moon of the second month in the first year of Duangping of the Song, by Chen Xianwei, styled Shaowei, known as Master Embracing Unity.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"Qian and Kun are the gate and door of the Yi, the father and mother of all hexagrams.\" The *Golden Jade Classic* says: \"The divine chamber is the pivot of the elixir, the father and mother of all minerals.\" Master Wei’s words—\"Qian and Kun are the gate and door of the Yi, the father and mother of all hexagrams\"—share the same meaning. Without the divine chamber, there would be no way to refine the elixir; without Qian and Kun, there would be no way to perceive the *Changes*. Qian and Kun are hexagrams of pure substance. The Six Children break this pure substance to form hexagrams.\n\nMaster Layman Ma said: \"When Qian and Kun intermingle, the Six Children are born.\" The Six Children are the broken forms of Qian and Kun. Thus, the Six Children arise from Qian and Kun, and the sixty-four hexagrams likewise emerge from Qian and Kun. Hence, they are called the father and mother of all hexagrams. The essence of the father and mother is originally pure yang and pure yin. With the birth of the Six Children, the forms of pure yang and pure yin are broken—how could they remain pure?\n\nChen Tuan said: \"Refine the broken form to restore the pure form.\" From this, we know that refining the broken form can return it to the pure form and enter the Dao. Refining the many minerals can return them to the divine chamber and complete the elixir. Yet these many minerals are not external things—they are the many hexagrams within our bodies. The divine chamber, too, is not an external thing.\n\nWithin our bodies lie Qian and Kun. To refine the Great Elixir, first establish Qian and Kun as the divine chamber. Once the divine chamber is set, transformations occur within it. Kan and Li serve as the encompassing frame, turning the hub with the axle in place. With Qian and Kun thus established, yin and yang naturally interact—Kun below uniting with Qian to form Kan, and Qian above uniting with Kun to form Li. When Kan and Li are complete, transformations again occur within them.\n\nChen Tuan said: \"The sun is the celestial qi, descending from the west to unite with earth; the moon is the terrestrial qi, ascending from the east to unite with heaven—this is the image of male and female conjoining in essence. Through the sun and moon’s movements, cold and heat arise, the four seasons take form, day and night divide, and yin and yang are determined. Yet heaven and earth do not themselves produce cold and heat—they arise from the sun and moon’s distance. Heaven and earth do not themselves produce the four seasons—they arise from the sun and moon’s north-south positions. Heaven and earth do not themselves produce day and night—they arise from the sun and moon’s rising and setting. Heaven and earth do not themselves produce darkness and light—they arise from the sun and moon’s mutual concealment. Though yin and yang are subtle, they do not transcend the sun and moon; though creation is vast, it does not transcend Kan and Li. Thus, though the changes of the many hexagrams are not uniform, they do not depart from the central lines of Kan and Li, which circulate through the six positions—just as the spokes of a wheel, though varied, do not depart from the turning of a single hub at its center. The central lines of Kan and Li refer to the one yang within Kan and the one yin within Li, which move up and down within the six lines. Laozi said: 'Thirty spokes share one hub—it is where there is nothing that the usefulness of the wheel lies.' Those who attain the Dao turn the sun and moon within their bodies, while ordinary people, ignorant of this principle, violate the yin and yang of creation and thus cannot avoid the peril of broken moats or the fault of lost spokes. What, then, do they possess of the encompassing frame or the true axle?\n\nThe four hexagrams of Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li serve as the bellows and key, covering and enveloping the Dao of yin and yang—just as a skilled charioteer follows the marking line, holds the reins, aligns the compass and square, and follows the wheel tracks, governing the center to control the exterior. Qian is pure yang, a male hexagram; Kun is pure yin, a female hexagram. Kan is yin containing yang, and Li is yang containing yin—these are the hexagrams of male and female union, hence called the four hexagrams of male and female. The other sixty hexagrams, whether with partial yin above or partial yang below, or partial yang above or partial yin below, are not pure in yin and yang and do not unite male and female, so they cannot be called male and female. Only these four hexagrams cover and envelop the Dao of yin and yang, serving as the bellows and key. Qian and Kun are the essence of the bellows and key, while Kan and Li are their function. Knowing the essence and function of these four hexagrams is like a craftsman following the marking line to meet the compass and square, or a charioteer holding the reins to follow the wheel tracks—governing the principle within to master the subtleties without. Then, all actions will be free from error, and every movement will accord with nature.\n\nIn the reckoning of pitch pipes and calendars, the monthly nodes have five or six divisions, and the warp and weft, serving the sun, combine to make sixty. Hard and soft have exterior and interior. Within the calendar, one month has thirty days, and the remaining sixty hexagrams beyond the four of male and female fittingly correspond to these days. Each day is served by two hexagrams—one as warp, one as weft. From morning’s *Zhun* and evening’s *Meng*, morning’s *Xu* and evening’s *Song*, to *Jiji* and *Weiji*, the hexagrams’ inner and outer, hard and soft forms—morning above and evening below, hard on the exterior and soft within—together with the preceding four hexagrams, complete the sixty-four hexagrams of the *Zhouyi*, all for our use. Thus, the Dao of the Great Elixir can be investigated through the *Yi*, and this is why the *Cantong Qi* was composed.\n\nAt the new moon’s dawn, *Zhun* presides over affairs, and by dusk, *Meng* is received. Day and night each govern one hexagram, used in sequence. When the end of the month’s darkness is reached, the cycle begins anew, with the day and hour as the measure. Movement and stillness have early and late. Master Ma Yi said: \"The waxing and waning of images do not stop at words; beyond words, meaning is revealed—only then is the Dao of the *Yi* truly understood.\" He also said: \"Hexagrams have inversions and oppositions, which are most critical. When the inverted form is profound, the opposite form is especially subtle.\" *Zhun* is a hexagram, and its inversion is *Meng*. From *Xu* and *Song* onward, all follow the inverted order. For hexagrams like *Yi* and *Xiaoguo*, which cannot be inverted, the opposite form is used instead. Thus, after *Yi* comes *Daguo*, which is its opposite—this is the opposite form. From the new moon’s dawn, using *Zhun* and *Meng*, to the month’s end, using *Jiji* and *Weiji*, the cycle turns endlessly, beginning anew. From this, we see that morning is yang and evening is yin, day is movement and night is stillness, near and far alternate, host and guest shift, waxing and waning follow, advancing and retreating proceed, life and death arise, fire is added and withdrawn—avoiding even the slightest error in timing, distinguishing the subtlest difference in withdrawing or adding, discerning floating and sinking, and applying with careful attention to dawn and dusk. Scholars, by contemplating the images, seek the meaning; having grasped the meaning, they may forget the images.\n\nThe *Wuzhen Pian* poem says:\n*\"Within this, grasp the meaning and seek no images;\nTo exhaust the many lines is but to weary the mind.\"*\nThis is the truth.\n\nIn spring and summer, rely on the inner body, from *Zi* to *Chen* and *Si*; in autumn and winter, employ the outer use, from *Wu* to *Xu* and *Hai*. Hexagrams have inner and outer bodies: the inner trigram of three lines models the year’s spring and summer, and the half-day from *Zi* to noon; the outer trigram of three lines models the year’s autumn and winter, and the half-day from noon to *Zi*. The inner trigram models yang, the outer trigram models yin—this is the image of Qian and Kun in harmonious exchange. Spring and summer nurture yang; autumn and winter nurture yin. After *Zi*, fire is advanced; after noon, the tally is withdrawn—the principle is one and the same.\n\nRewards and punishments correspond to spring and autumn; dawn and dusk follow cold and heat. The line statements contain benevolence and righteousness, manifesting with the seasons; joy and anger respond to the four seasons and five phases, attaining their principle. Reward is yang, punishment is yin; benevolence is yang, righteousness is yin; joy is yang, anger is yin. In the morning, yang is enacted to correspond to spring and summer; in the evening, yin is enacted to correspond to autumn and winter. If one can respond fittingly to the four seasons, one naturally attains the principle of the five phases—not through the petty actions of meting out rewards and punishments, hastily practicing benevolence and righteousness, or feigning joy and anger. Master Wei used this merely as a metaphor for the life and death of yin and yang. How much more so for the elixir, which is the essence of utmost yang? If even a trace of yin qi remains unrefined, it will ultimately fail to achieve completion. Those who cultivate the truth must be cautious in movement and stillness, speech and silence.\n\nThe qualities of cherishing life, benefiting others, kindness, forgiveness, generosity, love, loyalty, trust, harmony, joy, purity, tranquility, truthfulness, and sincerity—all these are yang. The qualities of killing, harming others, cruelty, jealousy, resentment, greed, stinginess, oppression, arrogance, harshness, obstinacy, lust, deceit, and falsity—all these are yin. Abandon yin and cultivate yang, and yin will naturally perish. When yin is exhausted and yang is pure, one naturally becomes true.\n\nThe heavens and earth establish their positions, and the *Yi* (Changes) operates within them. The heavens and earth are the images of *Qian* (Heaven) and *Kun* (Earth). \"Establishing positions\" refers to arranging the positions of yin and yang in mutual pairing. The *Yi* refers to *Kan* (Water) and *Li* (Fire). *Kan* and *Li* are the two functions of *Qian* and *Kun*. These two functions, without fixed line positions, circulate through the six voids, coming and going without fixed up or down, now hidden in obscurity, now concealed in concealment, transforming within and enveloping the myriad things as the guiding principles of the Dao.\n\nIn this passage, Master Wei explains that *Qian* and *Kun* serve as the divine chamber, arranging the positions of yin and yang in mutual pairing so that *Kan* and *Li* may interact within to achieve the work of transformation. The *Yi* refers to *Kan* and *Li*, which are the sun and moon as the *Yi*. The sun and moon are the *Yi* of heaven and earth, while *Kan* and *Li* are the *Yi* within the human body. *Qian* and *Kun* are its substance; *Kan* and *Li* are its function. These two functions, without fixed line positions, circulate through the six voids, coming and going without fixed up or down, now hidden in obscurity beyond measure, now concealed beyond trace, yet transforming within to generate the supreme treasure—just as the intercourse of yin and yang gives birth to the myriad things, serving as the guiding principles of the Dao.\n\nTo restrain the formless with the formed, the instrumental is empty, hence the saying: \"Push forth the waxing and waning, *Kan* and *Li* vanish.\" The *Jinbi Jing* (Scripture of the Golden and Azure) states: \"The formless and the formed restrain each other; the Vermilion Bird flames in emptiness, the purple radiance shines, cinnabar and mercury vanish.\" Master Wei’s words elucidate the precautions of the *Jinbi Jing*: it is to use the fire of inherent nature and true emptiness to restrain the supreme treasure of the water of life. The body of fire is fundamentally empty; when it encounters things, it manifests. That which is luminously empty and selfless is the virtue of fire. When fire is activated within the cauldron of the great void, the purple flames fill the heavens, the red light pervades the golden palace and jade towers, myriad transformations appear, divine beasts and dragons soar in countless forms—this is lead and mercury, this is *Kan* and *Li*. Yet though it is not nothing, once the work is accomplished, where does it reside? Hence it is said: \"Push forth the waxing and waning, *Kan* and *Li* vanish.\"\n\nWords are not idly fabricated; theories are not baselessly generated. They are drawn from verified effects, measured by divine illumination, and grounded in the principles of the structured characters. *Kan* corresponds to the lunar essence *wu*, *Li* to the solar radiance *ji*. The sun and moon are the *Yi*; hardness and softness correspond. Earth flourishes in the four seasons, weaving through beginning and end. Green, red, white, and black each reside in their respective directions, all receiving the workings of the central palace’s *wu* and *ji*.\n\nThe method of the *Yi*’s hexagram-numerology assigns *Kan* to the six *wu* and *Li* to the six *ji*. *Kan* is the moon, *Li* is the sun; hence it is said: \"*Kan* is the lunar essence *wu*, *Li* is the solar radiance *ji*.\" The characters for \"sun\" and \"moon\" combine to form the character for *Yi*; thus it is said: \"Push forth the structured characters.\" All these are grounded in principle as evidence, not idly fabricated theories. Since the *Yi* does not extend beyond the sun and moon, how could the elixir not be rooted in *Kan* and *Li*? Yet *Kan* and *Li* both contain *wu* and *ji*. As the ancients said: \"It is because both harbor the true earth that the golden elixir can return and revert.\" Moreover, earth flourishes in the four seasons, weaving through beginning and end. Though water, fire, wood, and metal each reside in their respective directions, they all receive the virtue of earth from the central palace. As Zhang Ziyang’s poem says: \"The four images and five phases all rely on earth; the workings of earth’s virtue are great indeed!\" For earth is the mother of metal. Knowing that the five phases all return to earth, one knows that the five phases all transform into metal. Only then can one restrain creation within the central palace and plant the yellow sprout in the later earth.\n\nThe *Yi* is imagery; no imagery is more luminous than the sun and moon. Exhausting the spirit to know transformation: when yang advances, yin comes, converging like spokes in a wheel, revolving in alternation, emerging and entering, coiling and uncoiling. The *Jinbi Jing* says: \"No illumination in the elixir art is greater than metal and fire; exhausting the subtle to enact transformation: when yang moves, yin dissolves.\" Master Wei correlates this with the *Appended Judgments* of the *Yi*. The great Dao of the *Yi* manifests its imagery in the sun and moon; the great Dao of the elixir illuminates its workings in metal and fire. Metal and fire are *Kan* and *Li*. Thus, when the essence of metal flourishes, the Jade Hare’s brilliance increases; when the virtue of fire is abundant, the Golden Crow’s intensity doubles. Once the scholar has exhausted the spirit to know transformation, making yang advance and yin come, converging like spokes in a wheel, revolving in alternation, emerging and entering, mutually coiling and uncoiling, taking the line images of the *Yi* as nodal markers and observing the sun and moon’s twilight and dawn to conduct the fire times, one naturally seizes the mechanism of heaven and earth and steals the marvels of creation.\n\nThe *Yi* has three hundred and eighty-four lines; accordingly, one selects the markers. \"Markers\" refer to the sixty-four hexagrams. From darkness to dawn, when *Zhen* (Thunder) arrives to receive the marker—at this moment, heaven and earth unite their essence, the sun and moon mutually sustain, the male yang spreads forth its purple radiance, the female yin transforms into the yellow womb. In the chaotic intercourse, the root is established, the foundation laid. Cultivating and nourishing the bud, the spirit congeals to form the body. All beings, from the great to the minute, from the creeping to the moving, none do not emerge from this.\n\nThe *Yi* has three hundred and eighty-four lines; the medicine has three hundred and eighty-four *zhu*. Twenty-four *zhu* make one *liang*; three hundred and eighty-four *zhu* make sixteen *liang*, which is the tally of the two eights. The principle of yin and yang’s ascent and descent is to select the hexagrams as markers and observe the markers to conduct the fire. The markers are the line images; there are no separate markers. In the language of the *Yi*, they are called hexagrams; in the language of the elixir, they are called markers. Hence it is said: \"Markers refer to the sixty-four hexagrams.\"\n\nWhen the hexagram corresponds to *Zhen*, the birth of yang, the fire advances with the marker of one yang. At this time, the divine chamber refines its essence, metal and fire interact, pushing forth the male yang dragon and the female yin tiger. \"Spreading forth the purple radiance\" refers to the dragon ascending the purple heavens to descend as rain. \"Transforming into the yellow womb\" refers to the tiger entering the later earth to produce metal. This is the imagery of ascending to heaven and entering earth, their chaotic intercourse. Thereupon, the root is established, the foundation laid; cultivating and nourishing the bud, the spirit congeals to form the body. From the great—heaven and earth—to the minute—creeping things—all that have form and qi emerge from this. Only by producing this one womb externally does one descend from the root to the branches, becoming the Dao of endless generation. Only by producing this one womb internally does one return to the root and revert to the source, attaining the Dao of long life and transcendence.\n\nThus, when Confucius praised the *Hong Meng* (Vast Obscurity), he extolled the virtue of *Qian* and *Kun* penetrating emptiness. When the ancient sages investigated the primordial, at the beginning of the *Guanju* (Osprey) chapter, the marriage of *qi* was first established, and the year’s first sprout flourished. Before form and *qi* were complete, it was called *Hong Meng*; once complete but not yet separated, it was called *Hun Lun* (Chaos). The *Yi* says: \"The *Yi* has the Supreme Ultimate, which generates the Two Modes.\" The *Yi* is like *Hong Meng*; the Supreme Ultimate is like *Hun Lun*. *Qian* and *Kun* are the transformations of the Supreme Ultimate. Combined, they are the Supreme Ultimate; divided, they are *Qian* and *Kun*. Thus, speaking of *Qian* and *Kun* combined is called *Hun Lun*; speaking of *Qian* and *Kun* divided is called heaven and earth. Confucius praised the *Yi* by first presenting *Qian* and *Kun* as the gateways of the *Yi*, for the virtue of *Qian* and *Kun* penetrating emptiness contains the *Yi* of *Hong Meng*.\n\nThe *Guan Ju* poem embodies the principle of marriage, taking the intertwining of the Two *qi* as its meaning. Before *Qian* and *Kun* divided, it was called *Hun Lun*; when yin and yang intertwined, it was called the beginning. *Liezi* says: \"The *Tai Chu* is the beginning of *qi*; the *Tai Shi* is the beginning of form.\" Thus, it is said that *Guan Ju* establishes the beginning.\n\nThe Golden Elixir is the Supreme Unity, the Primordial Lord, who takes the *qi* of *Qian* and *Kun* before division, yin and yang before separation, and transforms it into true mercury, refining it into true cinnabar. Hence, it is called the \"primordial unity of *qi*, the supreme essence of the undifferentiated.\" It is also said: \"There is a thing formed in chaos, born before heaven and earth.\" The *Jin Bi Jing* states: \"The Primordial Lord first refines mercury; the divine chamber contains the cavernous void. Mysterious whiteness gives birth to the Golden Duke, majestically establishing the beginning.\" Its defense lies here. The \"first year\" is the inaugural year, the initial stage of cultivation. In the first year, the yellow sprout flourishes, and the Golden Elixir is achieved.\n\nScholars must observe the seasons and conditions, apply effort to gather the supreme treasure, and thus congeal the Elixir’s head. Once the Elixir’s head is obtained, one naturally guards the celestial mechanism in silence and stands upon the transcendent sage’s ground. Worldly people, deluded and ignorant of the celestial mechanism, recklessly measure with private intentions, either misrecognizing deviant paths or mistakenly seeking external objects. How could they know that the divine, numinous treasure arises from emptiness and nothingness? For before *Qian* and *Kun* divided and yin and yang separated, there was already its time.\n\nThose who study the Dao must be utterly sincere, wholeheartedly turning toward the true Dao. Once they encounter a master who transmits the oral instructions—or thoroughly read this book and suddenly awaken—they will naturally comprehend its timing. Having grasped the timing, they can then gather the supreme treasure from emptiness and obtain the numinous thing from the indistinct. Someone may ask: \"How can there be anything within emptiness and the indistinct?\" The answer is: \"Have you not seen the burning mirror drawing fire and the water-mirror gathering moisture? Their fire and water arise from emptiness. It is only that people do not know that within emptiness itself, there are natural, divine, and wondrous functions—unseen, unheard, and untouchable.\"\n\nThe sage does not arise in vain; he observes and manifests the celestial signs. The celestial signs have advance and retreat, contraction and extension, responding to the seasons. Thus, the *Yi* governs the heart of heaven. The \"manifest celestial signs\" are the sun and moon. The sun and moon have advance and retreat, contraction and extension, corresponding to the *Yi*’s hexagrams, the ascent and descent of yin and yang, and the cyclical alternation of coming and going. Thus, we know the *Yi* governs the heart of heaven, and the sage composes the *Yi*—how could he have arisen in vain?\n\nThe *Fu* hexagram establishes the beginning, sprouting and growing. The son inherits the father’s body and founds his foundation upon the mother. The waxing and waning respond to the pitch pipes; the ascent and descent rely on the pivot of the Dipper. For three days, it emerges as dawn; *Zhen* receives *geng* in the west on the eighth day; *Dui* receives *ding* above, level as a taut cord. On the fifteenth day, *Qian*’s body reaches fullness in the east, where the toad and hare’s essences—sun and moon—shine with dual brightness. The toad observes the hexagram’s nodes; the hare emits its radiance. After the eight upper paths are completed, it bends and descends. On the sixteenth day, it turns to receive governance; *Xun* meets *xin* at dawn’s clarity. *Gen* stands upright within, then descends south on the twenty-third day. *Kun* receives *yi* on the thirtieth day in the northeast, losing its companion. When the nodes are exhausted, they alternate and succeed one another, and the dragon’s body is reborn.\n\nThe Great Dao is manifest in creation, yet creation is most difficult to fathom. If one can fathom creation and discern its mechanism, then one can probe the Dao’s wonders and steal its use. Who but true immortals and supreme sages could achieve this?\n\nThe ancient sagely perfected ones, benevolent toward the heart-mind of all under heaven, were beyond comprehension. Having fathomed the mechanism of creation to benefit themselves, they further illuminated its wonders to benefit others. What lies within oneself can indeed be known through mind and guarded by intention, yet to reveal it to others—without borrowing images or relying on texts—how could one make it manifest so that others might silently grasp it? Thus, they looked up and down between heaven and earth, and nothing displayed the wondrous workings of creation more clearly than the sun and moon. They searched through the classics, and nothing recorded the subtle principles of creation more profoundly than the *Yi*’s hexagrams. Comparing the sun and moon’s waxing and waning with the *Yi*’s changing lines and moving principles, they found perfect correspondence. This is the origin of the *Cantong Qi* (\"The Seal of the Unity of the Three\"). It is said to unite the principles of the *Great Yi*, the wonders of creation, and the Dao of the Great Elixir.\n\nNow observe: when the first yang arises, its hexagram is *Fu* (Return). *Zhen* (Thunder) below and *Kun* (Earth) above, *Zhen* is the eldest son, *Kun* the mother, and *Qian* (Heaven) the father. The *Fu* hexagram is originally pure *Kun*, with one yang emerging from *Qian* to transform the lower into *Zhen*. Thus, it is said, \"By the mother, the foundation is established.\" *Zhen* contains the body of *Qian* in subtle form; gradually accumulating, two yangs become three, and the body of *Qian* is complete. Hence, it is said, \"The eldest son inherits the father’s body.\" The waxing and waning correspond to the twelve pitch pipes: each month, one line is added. According to the *Big Dipper’s Pivot*, each hour, one *qi* advances. On the third day of the month, the moon appears faintly in the west at the *geng* position, corresponding to *Zhen*’s first yang arising. The *Zhouyi*’s \"Receiving the Stem\" method assigns *Zhen* to the six *geng*s. The principles of creation align thus. On the eighth day, the moon appears fully illuminated in the south at the *ding* position, corresponding to *Dui* (Lake), where two yangs arise and the *ding* method assigns *Dui* to the six *ding*s. By the fifteenth day, the moon is full in the east at the *jia* position, and the *Qian* hexagram receives the six *jia*s. At this time, the hexagram embodies three yangs, and both hare and toad are at their peak. The toad, essence of metal *qi*, observes the hexagram’s nodes and gradually waxes. The jade hare, spirit of *mao* wood, faces the great yang and emits its light. Seven and eight make fifteen; the Way of three and five is complete. Then, the full wanes, the extended bends, the high descends, and the ascending lowers. On the sixteenth day, one yin arises, and yin begins its governance. The moon appears at dawn in the west at the *xin* position, corresponding to *Xun* (Wind), which receives *xin*. By the twenty-third day, the moon appears at dawn in the south at the *bing* position, corresponding to *Gen* (Mountain), which receives *bing*. By the thirtieth day, the moon vanishes in the east at the *yi* position, corresponding to *Kun*, which receives *yi*. When the nodes are exhausted, they alternate, and yang resumes its governance, the dragon’s body reborn. The dragon is *Zhen*.\n\nAmong the eight hexagrams, only *Kan* (Water) and *Li* (Fire) do not participate directly, yet their functions rise and descend within the six hexagrams. The workings of *Kan* and *Li* are vast indeed! *Ren* and *gui* pair with *jia* and *yi*; *Qian* and *Kun* encompass the beginning and end. Seven and eight make fifteen; nine and six also correspond. The four together make thirty, when the yang *qi* withdraws and hides. The eight hexagrams are arrayed, the luminaries move, yet the center is never lost. *Qian* receives the six *jia*s and six *ren*s; *Kun* receives the six *yi*s and six *gui*s. Among the eight hexagrams, only *Qian* and *Kun* receive two stems; the rest receive one. Thus, it is said, \"*Ren* and *gui* pair with *jia* and *yi*; *Qian* and *Kun* encompass the beginning and end,\" revealing that within *Qian* and *Kun* lies true water. The lesser yang is seven, the lesser yin eight; together they make fifteen. The greater yang is nine, the greater yin six; together they make fifteen. The four combined make thirty, corresponding to the days of a month. Seven, eight, nine, and six are the Four Images. The principles of the *Great Yi* and creation are perfectly aligned.\n\nWhen the moon vanishes on the thirtieth day, the yang *qi* withdraws and hides. Beyond this, one yang arises anew. Revolving in cycles, ending and beginning again, moving without losing the center—this accords with creation without error and aligns with the hexagrams’ lines without deviation.\n\nThe primordial essence is subtle and difficult to perceive; by inference, verification, and evidence, one observes its images, models its forms, establishes standards, and sets norms. By divination, one determines fortune or misfortune, issues commands, and follows the seasons without fail. When lines move, one examines the *Hetu* above and orders the earth’s veins below, investigating the human heart-mind and integrating the Three Powers. In movement, one follows the hexagram’s nodes; in stillness, one relies on the *tuan*’s words. *Qian* and *Kun* are applied to act—how could the principles not be harmonious?\n\nThe primordial essence is the most numinous and divine treasure, born of emptiness and formlessness, dwelling in the subtle and indistinct, without trace or track. To gather it, one must thoroughly understand yin and yang, deeply penetrate creation, infer its correspondences, and verify its methods. In stillness, observe its images and model its forms; in movement, establish standards to divine fortune or misfortune. Above, examine the celestial patterns; below, observe the tides; within, investigate the human heart-mind. Further, follow the hexagram’s nodes: when yang acts, do not lose the line’s changing images; when yin is still, embody the utmost softness and contain light. Thus, the workings of *Qian* and *Kun* lie within oneself, and the numinous essence of spirit can be gathered. Moreover, when the eight winds harmonize, sweet dew descends; when yin and yang are balanced, sweet springs arise—these are the signs of heaven and earth in order. Harmony brings auspiciousness; discord brings calamity. How can one not be vigilant?\n\nThe first task of governance is to manage the subtle and secret, to open and spread the precious, to grasp the essential Dao, and to hold the handle that unifies transformation. When lines move within, fortune or misfortune arises without. The five planets move in harmony or disorder, responding to the seasons. When the four and seven are discordant, separation and opposition occur in all directions.\n\nAt the outset of cultivation, as at the beginning of governance, one must restrain and eliminate evil and excess, cast out desires, and manage the primordial *qi* to make it subtle, secret, and firm, without fear of leakage. Naturally, the treasure will spread in the golden womb, and spirit will be born in the jade chamber. If even a hair’s breadth is amiss, it is like governance gone awry, responding to the seasons with celestial anomalies. The key lies in regulating the fire and awaiting the precise moment, embodying the Big Dipper’s revolution. When lines move within, fortune or misfortune arises without, and the five planets may err or the constellations follow discord.\n\n*Wenchang* oversees and interrogates; the *Taifu* and hundred officials each govern their departments. The elixir resides in the spirit chamber, just as a ruler establishes a state. The ruler’s establishment of a state is modeled on celestial patterns: there are the Three Terraces and the positions of the ducal assistants, and the office of *Wenchang* that oversees and records. The duty of the ducal assistants is to sit and discourse on the Dao, harmonizing yin and yang, ensuring each official fulfills their role—hence, interrogation lies with the ducal assistants. The office of oversight measures talent, promotes the worthy, and demotes the unworthy, ensuring each official performs their duty—hence, oversight lies with *Wenchang*. When the hundred officials each fulfill their roles, the people and things are at peace, and all under heaven is harmonious. When the fire signs of the hexagrams do not lose their measure, the myriad transformations flow smoothly, and the sacred embryo grows. Yet governing a state depends on the summons of one person; refining the elixir depends on the resonance of one heart-mind.\n\nThe sun aligns with the essence of the Five Phases, and the moon receives the rhythm of the Six Pitches. Five and six make thirty degrees; when the degrees are complete, they begin anew. This is the origin and end, the thread of existence and decay. If the ruler is arrogant and excessive, overbearing and full, he violates the Dao. If the minister is treacherous and sycophantic, his conduct does not follow the proper path. When the waxing and waning of weights and measures deviate, misfortune and calamity arise. The enforcers of the law admonish and interrogate, reproaching the ruler for his faults.\n\nThis passage on five and six clarifies the function of water and earth. The number of earth is five, and the number of the sun is also five, for the number of the Five Phases is five. The number of water is six, and the number of the moon is also six, for the number of the Six Pitches is six. From *jia* to *gui* are the ten celestial stems, comprising five yang and five yin—this is the number five of the sun. The twelve lunar pitches comprise six *lü* and six *lü’*—this is the number six of the moon. Five and six make thirty degrees; when the degrees are complete, they begin anew—this is the cyclical recurrence of the dark and new moons. The two substances, metal and fire, alternately exist and decay between the dark and new moons. When the ruler is arrogant and excessive, overbearing and full, violating the Dao, it is because the weight of earth is excessive and its balance is awry. When the minister is treacherous and sycophantic, his conduct does not follow the proper path, it is because the weight of water is unstable. When weights and measures wax and wane, misfortune and calamity arise from deviation. The fault does not lie with fire but with earth. As the *Jinbi Jing* states: \"It is not the fault of fire; the blame is placed on earth.\" This is what it means.\n\nThe Northern Asterism receives the correct alignment, moving leisurely and entrusting matters to its subordinates. The Hall of Light enacts governance, and the state suffers no harm to the Dao. Internally, one nurtures oneself with tranquility, emptiness, and non-being, returning to the origin and illuminating within. The body is sealed, its openings fortified, and the three luminaries sink into obscurity. The child-pearl is tempered; though unseen, it is near and easily sought.\n\nThe cinnabar resides in the divine chamber as the Northern Asterism stands above, aligning the multitude of stars. The ruler enacts governance to oversee the myriad states. When centered and unmoving, the celestial array obeys in reverence. When one governs with folded arms and non-action, all under heaven is at peace. Thus, governing the state follows heaven, and the method of the elixir follows governance. One must conceal one’s brilliance, turn the light inward, and abide in non-action and silence, rooting deeply. The sun, moon, and myriad phenomena all sink together, their radiance concealed. The infant and the mysterious pearl grow, fundamentally tempered without deficiency. Within non-action, divine efficacy is revealed—not through form, but within formlessness. Though unseen and unheard, it is near and easily sought. It is not obtained from without but depends on the practitioner’s hidden merits and virtuous conduct.\n\nThe Yellow Center gradually permeates, its principle moistening and nourishing the skin. When the beginning is correct, the end will be cultivated, and the foundation will be established. One cannot rely on the yellow alone. Yellow is the color of the Central Palace, and cinnabar is the treasure of the Central Palace. The *Book of Changes*, in the *Wenyan* commentary on the sixth five of the *Kun* hexagram, states: \"The noble one is yellow and centered, penetrating in principle. He occupies the correct position and embodies the body, his beauty residing within. It flows through the four limbs and manifests in his undertakings—this is the height of beauty.\" How much more so when the body contains the great elixir and harbors the supreme treasure? Then his spirit and essence will be extraordinary, and his skin will be moist and lustrous—this is self-evident. Generally, to become an immortal, one must first become a noble person. If one’s virtue and conduct fall short of a noble person, one’s human Dao is still incomplete—how much more so the Dao of immortality? Thus, Master Wei drew from the *Book of Changes* the phrases \"residing in the center\" and \"treading the correct path\" to elucidate the principle of inner possession and outer manifestation. When those of superior capacity hear this, they accumulate merit and amass virtue to ascend as immortals. When those of middling capacity hear this, they at least do not fail to become good people and noble persons.\n\nThe One serves to conceal; the world does not know it. As the scripture states: \"When you comprehend the One, all matters are complete.\" Yet how easily can the wondrous principle of the One be known? Only after knowing this One can one attain this One. This One is the true One, the One of the One—it is not the numerical One. The true One, the One of the One, is born of the Dao, whereas the numerical One is the \"Heaven engenders water\" One. Knowing that the One is born of the Dao, the Dao of the great elixir is entirely encompassed. Thus, it is said: \"The One serves to conceal,\" but the world does not know it.\n\nSupreme virtue is non-action, not seeking through scrutiny. Inferior virtue acts, its function unceasing. When the upper is closed, it is called \"having\"; when the lower is closed, it is called \"non-being.\" \"Non-being\" serves the upper. Above, the spirit-virtue resides in these two apertures, modeling the qi of metal, which also mutually responds.\n\nThe Dao of heaven descends and shines; the Dao of earth ascends and is humble and dark. The Dao of *Kun* ascends, and its body is fundamentally still. Stillness is non-action, which cannot be sought through scrutiny. The Dao of *Qian* descends, and its body is perpetually in motion. Motion is action, ceaselessly striving. When the upper is closed, it is called \"having\"—the Dao of *Kun* ascends, and when closed, it has water, which has form. When the lower is closed, it is called \"non-being\"—the Dao of *Qian* descends, and when closed, it has fire, which leaves no trace. \"Non-being\" serves the upper—*Qian* can seek *Kun* and cause it to ascend. Above, the spirit-virtue resides—*Kun* contains the treasure of the true One. *Qian* descends and can generate the qi of *Kun*; *Kun* ascends and can generate the metal of *Qian*. The essential point lies in the two apertures of *Qian* and *Kun* mutually employing each other. When above and below interact harmoniously, metal abounds, and qi naturally arises. When qi abounds, metal naturally flourishes. Thus, metal and qi truly depend on each other—this is the wondrous function of *Qian* and *Kun*.\n\nTo know the white and guard the black is to invite the advent of spirit illumination. White is the essence of metal; black is the foundation of water. Water is the pivot of the Dao, its number named One, the beginning of yin and yang. It contains the yellow sprout and is the master of the five metals. The Northern River Cart, thus, is lead—externally black, internally harboring golden radiance. It wears coarse cloth yet holds jade within, appearing as a madman.\n\nWhite is silver; black is lead. To know the white and guard the black means to refine silver within lead. Refining silver within lead, spirit illumination naturally arises. Yin is the essence of metal; lead is the foundation of water. Among the Five Phases, only water’s number is One, aligning with the pivot of the Dao and serving as the beginning of yin and yang. Though not the true One of the One, it fulfills the function of the true One. Thus, the Dao of the true One first takes the golden child as the root of the yellow sprout. The golden child is water. To unite the myriad distinctions into One, one must first seek the One within the myriad distinctions as the foundation. This is the principle behind the method of the golden elixir employing lead. Thus, water is called the pivot of the Dao.\n\nDiscussing this, one clarifies that water attains the function of the true One but is not the true One itself. Water’s generating number is One; water’s completing number is six. Speaking in terms of the completing number six, water One contains earth Five. Thus, lead is externally black and internally contains golden radiance, possessing the wondrous function of containing the yellow sprout. Water is the beginning of the Five Phases; lead is the master of the five metals. Water originally resides in the north, but when transported southward, it ascends from below, carrying the treasure upward like a river cart. Thus, it is called the River Cart. Mixed with yellow, it wears coarse cloth—lead’s substance is inherently base.\n\nWithin lies white silver, hence it is called \"embracing jade\"—guarding the supreme treasure in concealment. Generally, the principles of creation and transformation all employ the base to guard the noble, the obscure to nurture the luminous, the lowly to preserve the exalted, and the mad to cultivate the sage. Though outwardly appearing as a madman, within he harbors the supreme treasure. Thus, the subtle mechanism remains sealed, and the shrewd merchant deeply conceals his goods—how can those who hastily seek others' recognition be spoken of in the same breath?\n\nMaster Wei’s method fundamentally resides in lead, yet its significance extends to both. Gold is the mother of water, the mother gestating the child’s embryo; water is the child of gold, the child concealing the mother’s womb. The true person’s wonder lies in being as if present, as if absent, resembling the great abyss—now sinking, now floating, advancing and retreating, each guarding its own domain. Silver is gold, lead is water; gold is water, hence gold is the mother of water. Water is the child of gold; lead conceals silver, hence the mother gestates the child’s embryo, the child conceals the mother’s womb. The golden embryo resides within lead, just as the true person dwells within the abyss—sometimes visible, sometimes hidden, now sinking, now floating. When lead is employed and water retreats, the abyss clears, and the true person emerges, each then guarding its own domain. The *Jinbi Jing* states: \"In the ash pool, flames scorch; lead sinks, silver floats\"—its principle is the same.\n\nGathering the white, refining it into vermilion, the exterior guards while the true resides within, square and round, a inch in diameter, intermingled yet mutually constrained—born before heaven and earth, majestic and supremely exalted. \"Gathering the white\" means collecting the floating silver, the supreme treasure of the west; \"refining it into vermilion\" means congealing the golden elixir, the sacred embryo in the southern chamber. When the elixir is formed, its manifestation resembles the primordial chaos of the cosmic egg, the true within the white, square and round, a inch in diameter, intermingled yet mutually constrained—this is Master Wei’s revelation of the precelestial symbolic method. Since it was born before heaven and earth, its majesty and exaltation are beyond contemplation.\n\nSurrounding it are ramparts and gates, resembling Penglai, encircling and enclosing, with four passages secured. Hesitating and guarding, the defense is firm and impenetrable, blocking all wickedness. Curved galleries connect, ever vigilant against the unforeseen—thus, one need not ponder calamities nor weary the spirit with anxieties. When the chamber is filled with *qi*, none can retain it. Those who guard it prosper; those who lose it perish. In movement and stillness, rest and activity, it constantly accompanies the practitioner.\n\nWithin the divine chamber, the symbolic form is complete, and the world is established. The golden wheel encircles it like ramparts, enclosing the world within, akin to the beauty of Penglai. The firmness of silver mountains and iron walls blocks all wickedness, ensuring no unforeseen threats. The four passages of jade towers and jasper pavilions allow for unobstructed spiritual play. At this time, one need not ponder calamities nor weary the spirit with anxieties, preserving great harmony as if holding a full vessel. A single thought’s movement or stillness, and the Dharma-body follows. When *qi* fills the body, it is most difficult to preserve. Guarding it brings prosperity; losing it brings ruin. Scholars, take heed!\n\nThese are not methods from the esoteric scriptures. Those who inwardly visualize with closed eyes, pondering the essence of the five viscera; who tread the Dipper and pace the celestial stems, invoking the Six Jia spirits by day and the Yin paths by night; who suppress the Nine Ones to disrupt primordial chaos; who consume *qi* through the primordial womb, causing the intestines to gurgle; who exhale the upright and inhale external evil; who remain sleepless day and night, ceaseless even at the new and full moons—such practitioners exhaust their bodies daily, their spirits weary and minds befuddled, appearing as if deranged. Their hundred vessels boil like cauldrons, never attaining clarity. Dwelling in earthen huts, erecting altars, they worship and sacrifice morning and evening, offering ritual objects, perceiving forms and images, their dreams filled with stirring emotions. Rejoicing and delighting, they believe their lives will surely be prolonged, only to die suddenly by heaven’s decree, their corpses exposed, their actions often perverse and contrary, losing the pivotal mechanism. Such arts are myriad—thousands of methods, tens of thousands of variations—all deviating from the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, twisting and contorting to the Nine Capitals.\n\nThe world’s arts and techniques are innumerable. Though the esoteric scriptures contain many methods, scholars must discern the true from the false, carefully examining right and wrong. Those who close their eyes to inwardly visualize the essence of the five viscera, tread the Dipper to draw the upright *qi* of the celestial stems, invoke the Six Jia by day and perform Yin rites by night, suppress the Nine Ones to practice Yin paths, exhale the upright *qi* and inhale turbid evil, consume *qi* through the primordial womb, remain sleepless day and night, ceaseless even at the new and full moons—such practitioners exhaust their bodies daily, their spirits weary and minds befuddled. Some erect altars to sacrifice to spirits; others seek divine favor through dreams. Though such arts are many, none are orthodox methods. Aspiring to longevity, they instead meet early death, their corpses rotting, their lives wasted—truly lamentable. How could they know that the golden liquid returning elixir transforms the fleshly body of parents, enabling flight and ascension? As described above, all such methods violate the Dao of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, their actions instead incurring wrath in the Nine Capitals’ courts.\n\nThe enlightened reflect on these principles, understanding the path to vastness. Diligently practicing day and night without rest, consuming the elixir for three years, they become light and ascend, traversing fire without burning, entering water without wetting. They can appear or vanish, ever joyful and free from care. When the Dao is accomplished and virtue perfected, they conceal themselves to await the time when the Great One summons them, relocating to the Central Land. When their merit is complete, they ascend, receiving the register and chart.\n\nThose in the world who understand this Dao reflect on Master Wei’s principles, knowing the path of cultivation. Diligently practicing day and night without ceasing, in less than three years, the elixir is accomplished. They can then emerge from water and enter fire, ascend lightly and travel afar, transforming with spiritual efficacy, carefree and at ease. Yet when the Dao is accomplished and virtue perfected, they must conceal themselves among people, accumulating merit and deeds, awaiting the summons of the Great One, the Primordial Lady. Then they relocate to the Central Land, receive the chart and register, and when their merit is complete, ascend, their bodies returning to the Purple Palace. This is what is meant by \"accumulating three thousand merits to become an immortal of the Great Luo\" and \"completing eight hundred merits to become a guest of the Great Luo.\" It all depends on the level of merit and deeds.\n\nThe *Fire Record* is not falsely composed; it elucidates the *Yi* to clarify it. The crescent-moon crucible, the White Tiger without scorching, the pivot of mercury—when the sun becomes the flowing pearl, the Green Dragon rises with it. East unites with west, the hun and po naturally constrain each other. Above, the trigram *Dui* numbers eight; below, the trigram *Gen* also numbers eight. The two eights unite their essence, and the body of *Qian* and *Kun* is formed. Two eights make one catty, the upright Dao uninclined. A catty has three hundred eighty-four *zhu*, corresponding to the number of hexagrams and lines. Ancient elixir texts describe the fire phases and their functions, calling them the *Fire Record*—six hundred chapters in all, yet their principles do not exceed the *Zhou Yi*. How could the *Fire Record* be composed without basis? It should be elucidated through the *Yi*.\n\nThe *Yi* has three hundred eighty-four lines, corresponding to the fire phases of the celestial cycle. The upper and lower eights make one catty; one catty records three hundred eighty-four *zhu*, perfectly matching the hexagrams and lines. The *Qian* lines number one hundred ninety-two; the *Kun* lines number one hundred ninety-two—thus, the Dao of *Qian* and *Kun* is complete. The crescent-moon crucible refers to the body and function of the mysterious pass’s single aperture.\n\nThis aperture is half white and half black, resembling a crescent moon—hence it is called the Crescent-Moon Crucible. To know the Crescent Moon as the crucible and cauldron is to comprehend more than half of the Great Elixir’s Dao.\n\nThe White Tiger lies below as the pivot of fire’s ignition; the Azure Dragon resides above, stirring the winds and waves of ascent. Within them, true mercury transforms and flows as pearls. Thus, the Eastern Dragon and Western Tiger intertwine, yin essence and yang spirit restrain each other, divine workings circulate within the golden tripod, and sacred medicine is forged in the jade crucible. The mechanism of creation is inverted, the functions of *Qian* and *Kun* are reversed—who but the most profoundly penetrating in the world could achieve this?\n\nWhen gold enters fierce fire, its color remains unaltered, and its radiance naturally emerges. Since the beginning of creation, the sun and moon have never waned in brightness; gold has never lost its weight. The sun and moon retain their constant forms, for gold is born from the moon. At the new moon, it receives the sun’s essence; when gold returns to its mother, the moon wanes, and they envelop each other, concealing their boundaries and sinking into the cavernous void. Gold regains its original nature, and its majestic radiance fills the crucible.\n\nThe sun, moon, and gold endure the longest. Since the opening of heaven and earth, the forms of the sun and moon have remained constant, never dimming in brightness; the weight of true gold has remained unchanged, never losing its luster. These three are of one body. People merely observe that when gold’s essence flourishes, the moon’s brightness doubles, knowing that gold is born from the moon—but they do not realize that the moon’s brightness originally arises from the sun. Thus, at the moment of their convergence, the moon conceals its light, sinking into the cavernous void to receive the sun’s transformation, thereby generating gold. Gold’s nature fundamentally derives from the sun, so its firmness, hardness, weight, and solidity bear the sun’s color and possess the sun’s nature. All things meet fire and none do not melt away—only gold, when placed in fire, does not lose its color. Refined a hundred times, it grows ever harder; tempered in great smelting, it becomes ever redder. Fire is the qi of the Great Yang; gold is the essence of the Great Yin. When gold enters fierce fire, it regains its original nature—thus, when the crucible’s fire blazes, gold’s color intensifies, and its majestic radiance becomes delightfully resplendent.\n\nThe *zi* and *wu* numbers combine to make three; the *wu* and *ji* numbers are called five. When three and five harmonize, the Eight Stones serve as the guiding principle. Breathing nurtures and embraces; contemplation unites them as husband and wife. Yellow earth is the father of metal; flowing pearls are the mother of water. Water relies on earth as its dam; earth restrains water from rising. The Vermilion Bird is the essence of fire, balancing victory and defeat. When water prevails, fire is extinguished; when both perish, they return to the fertile earth. The three natures, once united, share a common origin.\n\nThe Eight Stones are external medicine, exemplified by the three and five. The *zi* (water) is one; the *wu* (fire) is two. The numbers of *zi* and *wu* combine to form three. Earth’s number is five, hence *wu* and *ji* are called five. When three and five harmonize, water, fire, and earth unite. These three serve as husband and wife, alternately as ruler and minister, just as the Eight Stones mutually regulate. Earth generates metal, so earth is the father of metal; earth restrains water, so earth is the dam of water. Flowing pearls are mercury, born from the sun and congealed into metal. Metal generates water, so flowing pearls are the mother of water. Watering it extinguishes fire’s flames; damming it with earth prevents water’s overflow. Thus, the three substances form one family, all returning to *wu* and *ji*. When water meets earth, it dissipates; when fire meets earth, it subsides; when metal meets earth, it returns to its father. Earth is the father of metal, so fire is the ancestor of metal—hence, when the three natures unite, their original nature shares a common ancestor.\n\nSesame is also called *jusheng* (great victory), an ordinary herb—consuming it can still prolong life. How much more so the divine elixir, which is the essence of pure yang? Its nature is like unbreakable vajra, and gold is the most precious treasure among all things. If one obtains and consumes it, longevity will be incomparably greater than with ordinary herbs.\n\nThe four directions—*chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei*—all contain earth, showing that metal, wood, water, and fire all rely on earth to stand. Though the five viscera correspond to metal, wood, water, and fire, they ultimately depend on earth to flourish. Metal is the child of earth; when true elixir enters the abdomen and metal’s qi penetrates the five viscera, misty vapors pervade the body, steaming like the moment in smelting when fire blazes intensely and water is applied above, billowing like smoke and mist. At that time, the four limbs and hundred vessels brim with spring’s moisture, steaming and spreading naturally. The complexion is renewed, bones are transformed, old age returns to infancy, the countenance becomes radiant, the spirit joyful. White hair turns black, fallen teeth regrow in their original places, old men regain youth, and aged women become maidens. The form is altered, worldly calamities are escaped, clarity persists day and night, and consciousness remains awake. The dharma-body and illusory form are both fulfilled; yin essence and yang spirit are equally wondrous—only then can one be called a True Person.\n\nAt such a time, though mingling with the dust of the mundane, one is not of the Three Realms; though dwelling in the impure world, one’s conduct and concealment are unfathomable. If one wishes to depart, one directly ascends Penglai; if one desires to roam freely, one instantly transcends the realm of forms.\n\nWhen lead powder is cast into fire, its color is destroyed and returns to lead. Ice and snow, melted by warm water, dissolve into the Great Mystery. Gold takes cinnabar as its essence, harmonizing with mercury, transforming through its truth, beginning and ending in mutual dependence. To refine and consume the immortal elixir, one must use like substances—planting millet requires millet, hatching chicks requires their own eggs, and like substances naturally assist in completion. How can fish eyes become pearls? How can mugwort become sandalwood? Like substances follow each other; discordant matters do not form treasures. Thus, swallows do not bear phoenixes; foxes and rabbits do not nurse horses. Water does not flow upward; fire does not moisten downward.\n\nThings of like kind resonate without expectation, inevitably and without exception. Lead powder is originally lead; when burned and cast into fire again, its color is destroyed and returns to lead. Ice and snow are originally water; when warmed by fire’s qi, they return to water. The birth of the supreme treasure arises from the true essence of the Great Yang, gathering spirit and refining excellence. Initially forming cinnabar, within it already resides true mercury. When true mercury leaves its mother, it is called mercury. Mercury, in the great smelting, is refined by the Great Yang; over time, it congeals into silver. Silver, over time, transforms into gold—thus, gold fundamentally takes cinnabar as its essence. Cinnabar is spirit.\n\nThus it is said: the divine cinnabar and mercury are essence. Hence, in the initial stages of refining the elixir, one first gathers the essence of Yang to transform it into cinnabar, then takes mercury to blend with the cinnabar, grinding and harmonizing the two substances. Through smelting, they are refined into gold. Only after gold is formed does one employ lead for nurturing. For true essence arises from transformation, born of the Great Yang, yet must unite with the Great Yin to generate life—only with true lead can it be fit for ingestion. True lead is born of the Great Yin, thus it is said: like substances resonate; gold, when united with true lead, is as a child returning to its mother. Through this mutual assistance, the refining process is easily accomplished. It is like planting millet to grow grain, or a hen brooding over eggs—of like kind they resonate, of like qi they depend upon one another. Should one remain ignorant of this and seek elsewhere, one will but labor in vain, squandering effort, just as sparrows cannot hatch phoenixes, foxes cannot nurse colts, water cannot steam things, nor fire moisten them.\n\nGrasping this principle, when cinnabar and mercury unite, spirit is born; when water and fire interact, steaming and moistening occur. Thus, fire resides below water yet achieves the work of rising flame; water resides above fire yet fulfills the virtue of descending moisture. If not for the utmost essence under heaven, who could attain this? Many scholars in the world, though learned and ingenious, possessing fine talents, meet no opportunity. They exhaust fire and waste wealth, relying on texts and following them blindly, fabricating methods without foundation, losing measure and control. They pound and treat ginger stone, chalcanthite, mica, alum, magnetite, sulfur, and burn cedar clay, mixing them with the Five Minerals and copper, using these as aids. Yet their natures differ, their kinds do not align—how could they ever unite as one? A thousand attempts lead to ten thousand failures. Seeking success, they instead become deluded; hoping for fortune, they never encounter the sagely way. Alone, the sage understands. From youth to white-haired age, they waver midway, abandoning the Dao to cling to delusion, straying from the correct path into error. Their vision narrow as a tube, their knowledge too limited to fathom what lies ahead.\n\nThe principle of the golden elixir surpasses creation, far beyond the reach of thought. Without encountering a perfected one, all measurement is futile. To employ external substances is even more reckless—clinging to the heterodox while forsaking the orthodox is no path for the worthy. Yet those who often study the Dao are unwilling to steadfastly seek teachers and friends, to endure hardship and diligently inquire. Some begin but do not persist; others waver midway, wasting years until old age, achieving nothing. All this stems from the error of those who, peering at the sky through a tube, remain self-satisfied.\n\nYet the sun and moon shine brightly, the heavens and earth vast; cold and heat come and go, morning and evening alternate—all embody the principle of the Great Dao’s cyclic return. Without encountering a perfected one, it is difficult to fathom. Scholars should first accumulate deeds and amass virtue to invoke such an encounter, never deceiving themselves, lest they reach this mountain of treasure only to return empty-handed.\n\nAs for the utmost sages, none surpass Fuxi, who first drew the Eight Trigrams, modeling them on heaven and earth. King Wen, the ancestor of emperors, structured their forms and composed the line statements; the Master, among the host of sages, crafted the Ten Wings to assist them. These three lords, heaven-endowed, arose in succession to govern their times. Though their steps varied in excellence, their merits and virtues did not differ. Their creations built upon one another, their measurements precise to the fraction. What has form is easy to contemplate; what lacks omen is difficult to ponder. Their works became models for the world, establishing the *Book of Poetry* and *Book of Documents*, though these lacked prior knowledge, relying instead on teachers to awaken. Bright as lifting the curtain, wide-eyed as ascending a high tower.\n\nMaster Wei, though endowed with exceptional natural talent, still relied on a teacher for awakening. Thus he sighed: the wondrous principle of the golden elixir, having neither form nor omen, is truly difficult to contemplate or measure. Though the Three Sages embedded this principle in the *Book of Changes*, and the Eight Trigrams encompass the subtle workings of creation, their images point to the marvels of form, their words reveal the portents of function. Measured against the *Cantong Qi*, they still adhere to worldly methods. Though the sages weighed fractions and crafted their works for scholars to explore the profound and infer the obscure, how could they guard secrets within their words, transcending images midway? If the *Cantong Qi* had not been composed, how could this obscurity be illuminated? Thus, Master Wei, following books that exhaust principle and fulfill nature, described the way of transcending the mundane to enter sageliness—like holding the left tally, like lifting the front curtain. This arose from the transmission of teacher and disciple, not from prior knowledge. Know then that though heavenly mechanisms are distant, every person has a share; though the Great Dao is profound, every generation finds its inheritor. Do not say that only those with innate immortal bones may aspire to it. Know rather that with but a willing heart, none is unattainable. Master Wei’s humble words, both before and after, reveal the true compassion of past immortals.\n\nThe *Fire Record of Six Hundred Chapters* pursues the same aim, though its texts differ. Its words are earnest, yet people do not ponder deeply to trace its source and flow, though the obscure and manifest originally dwell together. How could I, speaking for the worthy, dare to treat it lightly? Yet if I were to seal my lips and silence the Dao, I would incur blame; to inscribe my thoughts on bamboo and silk would risk leaking heavenly secrets. Hesitating, I sigh, looking up and down, weaving these considerations. Though the methods of refining have their rules, I cannot bear to reveal them all. Thus, I briefly outline their essentials, their branches and leaves appearing in scattered form.\n\nScholars of the world, seeing the alchemical classics’ discussions of purple writings, fire phases, and the progression of advancing and retreating, civil and martial functions—each with its beginning and end, rise and cessation—are rarely without doubt. Hence, many texts state there are six hundred chapters to encompass the functions of fire phases. Yet they do not know that though the words differ, the substance is one; though the uses vary, the essence is the same. Once one recognizes the reversal of morning *zhun* and evening *wei*, one understands the cyclical return of day *gou* and night *fu*—like the turning of the celestial sphere, like following wheel tracks. Though the words are earnest, they are but diligent admonitions. Thus, six hundred chapters encompass three hundred days, never departing from the two trigrams of advance and retreat. All lies in the sincerity of beginning and end, the single-mindedness of intent, precise to the finest thread.\n\nAlas! The sagely words are not obscure, yet the world does not ponder deeply. Thus, Master Wei composed three additional chapters, all embodying the same principle. He sought to clarify the essentials, expound the methods, and make the path easy for later learners to understand. How vast!\n\nUse gold as a dike, and water enters to flow freely. Gold accounts for fifteen, and water’s number is the same. When tending the furnace, fix the weights and measures: five parts water, with two parts surplus. These two are true gold, heavy as the original. The remaining three do not enter the fire but accompany them. The three substances mutually contain and receive, transforming as if by magic. Below, the qi of the Great Yang lies hidden, steaming. In an instant, it first liquefies, then congeals—this is called the Yellow Chariot. As months and years pass, it nears decay, harming longevity. The body becomes like dust in a bright window.\n\nTo refine the great elixir, first use pure gold to construct the city walls, encircling them completely. Then take true water and place it within, so that no seepage occurs. Some call it the golden dike, others the city walls—both express this idea.\n\nTo build the golden dike, merely understand the principle that the Four Images and Five Phases fully rely on earth, and gold will naturally form.\n\nTo employ the true earth of the Five Phases is to perfect the true gold of the Five Phases—earth being the mother of metal. Once the true gold of the Five Phases is achieved, it can then contain the true water of the Five Phases—water being the child of metal. Water, earth, and metal intertwine to form a square shape of earth, within which the infant appears. When activated and ascending, the golden light fills the chamber, billowing like a chariot in motion—hence the name \"Yellow Chariot.\"\n\nWhen tending the furnace, ensure the weight of gold does not exceed five fen, allowing the water to be slightly more abundant. The three that do not enter the fire—two accompanying them—are wood (three) and fire (two). Fire (two) and wood (three) do not enter, much like the soul and spirit, which are inherently formless yet manifest through things. The work of true refinement lies in refining the three substances: water, earth, and metal. Once these three coalesce and form the treasure, the soul and spirit naturally accompany them in wondrous union.\n\nWater enters the golden dike, originally a congealed liquid, steamed and refined by the hidden qi of the Great Yang below. Once the fire’s power is complete and the divine work fulfilled, it transforms into the Yellow Chariot, capable of myriad changes—whether as a dragon-drawn carriage or any other form. Upon shedding its embryo, the body shimmers like dust illuminated by sunlight through a bright window, revealing the accomplished transformations of Master Wei. Yet how can the world know? Those who recklessly speculate have never glimpsed even a dream of it, daring to voice their conjectures. Only those who have personally witnessed it can understand.\n\nIn the process of pounding, blending, and merging, enter the Crimson Gate, sealing its borders to ensure firmness. Ignite the blazing fire below, maintaining it day and night with unwavering diligence. Begin with the civil (wen) and conclude with the martial (wu), observing and adjusting with care. Monitor the cold and warmth, cycling through the twelve nodes, each completing its turn in mutual intimacy. When qi is nearly exhausted and life on the verge of cessation, the body approaches death—yet the hun and po transform, their hues shifting to a radiant purple, forming the Reverted Elixir. Powdered and measured with a ninefold knife’s edge, it is most divine.\n\nThis speaks of the work’s power, moving the bellows of heaven and earth. Pound and refine it until reaching the southern Crimson Gate, firmly sealing the boundary between water and fire. This labor continues day and night: first ascending with wen, then descending with wu, cycling through the twelve hours. As the day ends, they should grow ever closer. When qi is nearly spent and life hangs by a thread, the hundred vessels return to their root, and the myriad orifices fall silent—not death, yet akin to it. After this cessation, revival occurs: the golden light turns purple, resembling purple powder, a mere knife’s edge in quantity, manifesting everywhere in unfathomable transformations of divine wonder.\n\nExpounding the numbers of the Five Phases, the method is concise yet not cumbersome: use water to stimulate fire, and its light is suddenly extinguished. Yet the sun and moon, too, are water and fire. At each conjunction, they do not harm one another—why? Because the mutual consumption of heaven and earth’s yin and yang follows a fixed pattern, a set rhythm. There is no harm in water’s dominance or fire’s decline. Those who perceive this mechanism and steal its use hold the cosmos in their hands and the myriad transformations within their bodies. Though water and fire are mutually destructive, they unite as husband and wife; though metal and wood are separated, they naturally communicate. Yet none in the world can see or know this—how lamentable!\n\nThe name defines the essence, while the term arises from nature. When metal returns to its original nature, it is called the Reverted Elixir. I dare not speak falsely, for I emulate the sages: the ancient texts speak of the Dragon and Tiger, the Yellow Emperor’s praise of Golden Flowers, Huainan’s refinement of Autumn Stone, and Wang Yang’s addition of Yellow Sprouts. The worthy may practice this, but the unworthy should not partake. The Dao of past and present arises from a single pair—let scholars exert effort, reflect deeply, and ponder its utmost importance. The words are clear and luminous, never deceiving me.\n\nThis explains why the Reverted Elixir is so named: \"revert\" refers to essence, \"elixir\" to nature. \"Metal returns to its original nature\" means that Metal Elder, born of my nature, now returns to its mother, reuniting with its origin. Together with the Maiden, it forms the infant—hence the Reverted Elixir. As the poem by Master Purple Yang says: *\"Metal Elder was originally the Eastern House’s child, sent to the Western Grove to lodge. Once recognized, call it home to nurture, betroth it to the Maiden, and unite in affection.\"* Though ancient and modern names differ, the Dao remains one.\n\nThe *Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n*Explication of the Union of the Three in Accordance with the Book of Changes*, Scroll Middle\nBy Chen Xianwei of the Song Dynasty\n\n**Middle Scroll**\n\nThe firmness of Qian and the softness of Kun pair and envelop one another; yang endows while yin receives. Male and female depend on each other, and only then do essence and qi unfold to bring forth creation. Kan and Li crown the head, their radiance shining forth. Their profundity is difficult to fathom, and they cannot be depicted in diagrams. The sage measures and weighs, arranging the primordial foundation. The four are merged in primordial chaos, entering directly into the formless. The sixty hexagrams spread forth like a chariot’s canopy. The dragon-horse is harnessed, and the enlightened ruler takes the reins. When harmony prevails, one follows the level path; if not, the Way becomes perilous, the state topples, and the nation falls into danger.\n\nThe firmness of Qian and the softness of Kun—these two pair and alternately envelop one another, so that yang naturally endows while yin receives and conceals. For yang, being male, scatters and bestows, while yin, being female, contains and receives. Solitary yang does not generate; solitary yin does not nurture. Only when male and female depend on each other do essence and qi unfold and spread to complete creation. Just as the conception of a child invariably arises from the union of yin and yang, so too must Qian and Kun be taken as the beginning. Now, it is said that Kan and Li crown the head because Qian and Kun are Heaven and Earth, while Kan and Li are the Sun and Moon. Heaven and Earth, though fixed in position, cannot merge into one, yet within them, the Sun and Moon unite as one. Thus, Qian and Kun are the body of the medicine, while Kan and Li are its function. The reason only Kan and Li are said to crown the head is to clarify that the function of the great medicine lies entirely in Kan and Li. Therefore, Qian and Kun serve as the crucible, while Kan and Li serve as the medicine. Yet the function of Kan and Li operates between the two bodies of Qian and Kun, ascending and descending, flying and submerging without fixed form—how could this be easily depicted in diagrams?\n\nThe sage, wishing to measure and weigh its profound subtleties to instruct scholars, observes only the sixty hexagrams of Li and Kan, where one yang line and one yin line, sometimes above and sometimes below, are difficult to fathom. One must act like an enlightened ruler governing the times, taking the sixty hexagrams as a chariot and proceeding with effortless action to harness the dragon-horse. Then one may advance leisurely and steadily, progressing along the Way with grace and ease, the path smooth and unobstructed from beginning to end, cycling through all the hexagrams. How could there be peril or obstruction? Thus it is said: \"When harmony prevails, one follows the level path, free from deviation.\" If one fails to grasp this and recklessly follows a deviant path, there will be the worry of collapse and the fault of danger.\n\nLiu Haichan said, *\"Do not let the Purple Cart overturn,\"* which conveys the same meaning—though the path may be smooth, one must guard against peril and cannot be careless.\n\nThe noble person, dwelling in their chamber, speaks good words, and a thousand *li* away, they are answered. This is like the lord of ten thousand chariots, abiding in the innermost chamber, issuing decrees and commands in accordance with the rhythms of yin and yang, storing instruments and awaiting the proper time, never violating the hexagrams and months. *Zhun* begins at *zi*, and *Meng* at *yin*; the remaining sixty hexagrams each have their own days.\n\nFor those who cultivate the elixir, residing in seclusion for a year is especially arduous. Even the slightest movement has profound effects, like the lord of ten thousand chariots dwelling deep within the ninefold palace, where every action, stillness, word, and silence affects the harmony of Heaven. As the *Book of Changes* says, *\"The noble person dwells in their chamber, yet their influence extends a thousand *li*,\"* which serves as an apt comparison. One must follow the ascent and descent of yin and yang, advancing and halting in accordance with virtue, cherishing the treasure as if it were one’s eyes, nurturing the embryo as if holding a full vessel, awaiting the arrival of the proper time, never violating the hexagrams and months. *Zhun* spans from *zi* to *shen*, and *Meng* from *yin* to *xu*. The remaining hexagrams each have their own times, for each day comprises two hexagrams, and each hour, six lines. To discern yin and yang, one must distinguish day and night; to know day and night, one must distinguish light and dark. Once light and dark are distinguished, the hexagrams and lines are understood. As the *Book of Changes* says, *\"One who understands the Way of day and night knows this.\"*\n\nI have briefly presented the two images, though I have not fully exhausted their subtleties. Establishing principles and setting punishments, acting with benevolence and virtue—those who go against these meet misfortune, while those who follow them meet good fortune. According to the calendar, one must be sincere, focused, and meticulous, observing day and night, scrutinizing the ebb and flow. Even the slightest deviation brings regret and adversity.\n\nThe two images refer to *Zhun* and *Meng*. Not fully exhausting their subtleties means I dare not reveal the celestial mechanics of the fire times. When a scholar encounters a teacher and receives the method, they must act in accordance with the calendar, being sincere, focused, and meticulous, observing day and night, scrutinizing the ebb and flow. When yang arises, advance as if acting with benevolence and virtue; when yin arises, retreat as if establishing principles and setting punishments. Those who follow meet good fortune; those who go against meet misfortune. If even the slightest deviation occurs, regret and adversity arise within, becoming thieves and harm. Like weeds in a field or dust on a mirror, even those who refine cinnabar fear errors in water and fire—how much more so for this great elixir of golden liquid?\n\nAt the two solstices, the measures change, and if they go awry, complications arise. In the depths of winter, scorching heat; in the height of summer, frost and snow. At the two equinoxes, the directions are askew, the clepsydra’s flow unregulated, wind and rain untimely, floods and droughts contending, locusts swarming, and myriad anomalies emerging. Heaven displays its omens, mountains collapse, and the earth splits. The filial son’s sincerity moves the August Ultimate, bringing near what was uttered and spreading afar what was distant, sometimes inviting misfortune, sometimes bringing fortune, sometimes ushering in great peace, sometimes inciting war. These four outcomes arise from the heart’s intentions.\n\nThe two solstices mark the beginning of yin and yang. If their function goes awry, celestial anomalies follow—snow in summer, thunder in winter, and calamities arise. The two equinoxes are where yin and yang intersect. If their function goes awry, celestial anomalies likewise follow—mountains collapsing, the earth splitting, floods and droughts causing endless disasters. This occurs because those who regulate the fire lose the proper time, causing the true embryo to be harmed and the world to crumble. The filial son symbolizes the true embryo, and the August Ultimate symbolizes fortune and misfortune. Whether great peace or war arises, whether fortune or misfortune is invited, all stem from the intentions of those who regulate the fire. The method of refining the elixir is no different from the methods of the world. Yet the responses to governing the world are like echoes and shadows—how much more so when seizing the creation of Heaven and Earth, aligning one’s virtue with Heaven and Earth and synchronizing one’s movements with them?\n\nMovement and stillness have their constancy; one must adhere to the marking line. The four seasons proceed in harmony, aligning with qi. Firmness and softness are decisively distinguished, not intruding upon one another. The Five Phases each guard their boundaries, not recklessly expanding or contracting. The *Book of Changes* flows and circulates, bending and stretching, reversing and turning. As for the fire times and fortune and misfortune, as previously discussed, one must maintain constancy in movement and stillness, following the marking line without deviation. The four seasons proceed in harmony, naturally aligning with the two qi. Firmness does not overstep, and softness does not retreat. Whether bending or stretching, reversing or turning, the Five Phases circulate, each guarding their boundaries—only then can one be free from worry.\n\nBetween the dark and new moons, the tally is joined, and primordial chaos merges with the vast expanse. The female and male follow one another, their fluids moistening and nourishing, their transformations flowing and circulating. The spirits of Heaven and Earth cannot be measured. Utilizing them, one secures the body, concealing the form and hiding it. It begins in the northeast, in the region of *Ji* and *Dou*, then moves rightward, spewing forth the wheel and spitting out the sprout. Hidden in the deep pool, an image appears, scattering its essence and light.\n\nBetween the dark and new moons, one must join the tally and move within the center, like primordial chaos merging with the vast expanse—beyond measure. This is the time when the female and male follow one another, their fluids moistening and nourishing, their transformations flowing and circulating. How could one apply effort here? Thus, by utilizing them, one secures the body, concealing the form and hiding it. It begins in the northeast, in the region of *Ji* and *Dou*, then moves rightward, spewing forth the wheel and spitting out the sprout, scattering its essence and light. As the poem by Hanshanzi says: *\"Do not expose the root, for the root will naturally fall.\"* The body and its function differ, and so too does the application of effort.\n\nAbove *Mao* and *Bi*, *Zhen* emerges as the faint yang qi begins its inception. In the *First Nine*, the hidden dragon lies low; yang is established by three, and yin is connected by eight. Thus, on the third day, *Zhen* stirs; on the eighth day, *Dui* moves. In the *Nine in the Third*, the dragon appears in the field, harmonious and luminous. The *Second* and *Fifth* virtues align, and the *Qian* body is complete. In the *Nine in the Third*, vigilance at dusk brings loss and decline to the spirit tally—its rise and fall are cut short, returning to its origin. *Xun* continues the lineage, firmly holding fast. In the *Nine in the Fourth*, one may leap forward or retreat, the Way perilous. *Gen* governs advance and cessation, not to be transgressed in time. On the twenty-third day, one guards the appointed term. In the *Nine in the Fifth*, the flying dragon ascends to the celestial position, adding joy. In the *Six in the Fifth*, *Kun* bears and binds, completing the cycle, nurturing all beings as the eternal mother. In the *Nine at the Top*, the dragon soars too high, its virtue cast into the wilds. With *Use the Nine*, it flutters as the Dao’s compass and square. When yang’s numbers are exhausted, they begin anew, turning to align with nature and unite with inherent qualities.\n\nWei Jun illustrates the waxing and waning of the moon within a month, likening it to the hexagrams’ advance and retreat: from the third day, the first yang arises; by the eighth day, the second yang; by the fifteenth, the third yang is complete, and the *Qian* body is formed. On the sixteenth, the first yin is born; by the twenty-third, the second yin; by the thirtieth, the third yin is complete, and the *Kun* body is perfected. *Mao* and *Bi* reside in the west, in the position of *Geng*, as mentioned in the previous volume. *Zhen* and *Geng* appearing in the west share the same meaning, as previously described in detail. Wei Jun repeats this to deepen the learner’s understanding of body and function.\n\nFollowing the turning of the celestial pivot, ascending and descending, rising and falling, the six lines circulate in a cycle difficult to perceive—thus, they have no fixed position, becoming the ancestral source of the *Yi*. Within a single day, the fire phases revolve like the turning of the celestial pivot: from *Zi*, ascending to *Wu*, then descending, traversing the six lines. Though no visible traces can be observed, the subtle workings of creation are guarded in the heart. At these times, the elixir medicine arrives with the sun, ascending and descending, rising and falling without cease—never occupying a fixed position. This aligns with the *Great Yi*’s principle of yang ascending and yin descending. That it is called the ancestral source of the *Yi* means the sages first grasped the principle of golden elixir through self-cultivation, transcending the mundane to attain sagehood, and only afterward expounded this principle in the *Yi* to instruct later generations. Thus, the *Great Yi* was created based on the great elixir, and the Way of the great elixir is the ancestral source of the *Yi*.\n\nAt the dawn of the new moon, *Fu* arises, and yang qi begins to flow, entering and exiting without haste. Erect a subtle marker of firmness: the *Yellow Bell* is established in *Zi*, its signs flourishing, spreading warmth and gentle steam, allowing the common people to thrive in constancy. At midnight, the *Zi* hour, the fire phase begins its work. Before the first yang arises, the fire phase remains still, and the multitude of yin gathers like the masses without governance. Once the fire phase stirs, yang qi begins to flow, spreading warmth and gentle steam, suffusing the cauldron with radiance. When the first signs appear, it becomes the master of all transformations. At this time, the cultivator must silently guard the mechanism of advancing the fire, using subtle firmness as the standard. Entering and exiting, coming and going, gathering and releasing proceed without haste, naturally nourishing and gradually increasing until pure *Qian* and *Kun* refine the precious treasure. In the initial stages, one must be especially cautious. As the ancients’ poem says: *\"On cold nights, tend the fire; guard against the crowd until dawn.\"* This embodies the meaning of *\"spreading warmth and gentle steam, allowing the common people to thrive in constancy.\"*\n\nIn *Lin*, the furnace is tended, the path opened, and the radiance gradually advances, growing day by day. In *Chou*, the *Great Lü* is established, its structure rising and falling. At the *Chou* hour, the second yang fire phase advances. By this time, the radiance gradually increases, opening the mysterious path and illuminating the true light. Yang arises from below, so one must bind it there. At this stage, the work is lowly; after passing this line, one gradually lifts and follows the transformative mechanism—thus, *\"its structure rises and falling.\"*\n\nRaising it forms *Tai*, where firmness and softness flourish together, yin and yang intertwine, the small departs and the great arrives, converging in *Yin* and advancing with the season. At the *Yin* hour, the third yang fire phase advances. By this time, firmness and softness are distinct, yin and yang each half. Above is water, below is fire—essence-water ascends, spirit-fire descends. The ascending seeks to rise, the descending seeks to fall; yin and yang intertwine, the small departs and the great arrives, and creation converges here.\n\nGradually progressing through *Dazhuang*, arrayed at the *Mao* gate, the elm pods fall and return to their root. Punishment and virtue contend, and day and night begin to divide. At the *Mao* hour, the fourth yang undergoes the bathing phase. At this time, day and night divide, life and death are balanced, and all things flourish in spring—yet the elm pods alone fall. This is because the elm pods correspond to the stars, and by dawn, they wither. The golden elixir parallels the myriad phenomena, and all phenomena arise from the sun and moon.\n\nIn *Guai*, yin retreats as yang ascends, washing and cleansing the wings, shaking off the dust of the roost. At the *Chen* hour, the fifth yang fire phase advances. By this time, the fifth yang ascends, and the water source is clear and limpid, like a bird emerging from water, shaking its wings, preparing to soar into the heavens.\n\nIn *Qian*, vigor flourishes, its brightness spreading to the four neighbors. Yang culminates in the center of *Si*, and the spirit is full. At the *Si* hour, the sixth yang fire phase advances. By this time, the pure *Qian* body is complete, the moon full, the water abundant, the light flourishing, and the spirit full—upright yet not biased, round yet not lacking, its radiance spreading to the four directions, illuminating all ten directions.\n\nIn *Gou*, the beginning is recorded, treading frost first, like the cold spring at the well’s bottom. *Wu* guards the guest, the guest concealed within yin, yin as the host. At the *Wu* hour, the first yin tally retreats. By this time, yin is the host and yang the guest. If one fails to recognize the host within the guest and the guest within the host, the slightest deviation brings great harm. Do not dismiss the first yin as harmless—like treading frost, ice will soon follow. The ancients’ urgent emphasis on distinguishing host and guest stems from this.\n\nIn *Dun*, the world is abandoned, the position relinquished, essence gathered, and virtue cherished, awaiting the time to rest in obscurity. At the *Wei* hour, the second yin tally retreats.\n\nIn *Pi*, obstruction prevails, and what sprouts cannot grow. Yin extends, yang withdraws, and yang’s name is erased. At the *Shen* hour, the third yin tally retreats.\n\nIn *Guan*, its authority and measure are observed. In mid-autumn, the emotions of the season are entrusted to the stored, the tender and the old, the withered and the flourishing. Shepherd’s purse and wheat sprout anew, growing beneath the cover.\n\nAt the *You* hour, the fourth yin tally retreats—this is the bathing phase. Shepherd’s purse and wheat respond to the sun, so by the eighth month their sprouts emerge. The sun’s essence is conceived at *You*, for wood is nurtured within at this time, and earth undergoes its bathing. Thus, *You* marks the bathing phase.\n\nIn *Bo*, the limbs rot and the form dissolves, its transformation into qi exhausted, its spirit lost.\n\nAt the *Xu* hour, the fifth yin tally retreats. When the Dao is exhausted, it returns to Kun’s primal origin. In solemn compliance with earth’s principles, it bears heaven’s mandate and spreads its decree.\n\nAt the *Hai* hour, the sixth yin tally retreats. The profound and distant, though separated by barriers, remain connected in resonance. It nurtures the seed, the source of yin and yang, vast and indistinct, its beginning unknowable. Those who lose their way first become lost, while those who follow later become masters. Without a level ruler, the Dao naturally inclines. Its transformations alternate in waxing and waning, ever responsive. From Kun’s end arises Fu’s beginning, like tracing an unbroken ring. Emperors and kings ride this principle, enduring for a thousand generations.\n\nThe magnet’s attraction of iron, the burning mirror’s capture of fire, the moon’s gathering of water—all exemplify the mutual resonance of yin and yang, their barriers transcended. How could one fathom its beginnings? In the practice of elixir refinement, one first wanders in confusion, but once the fire-tending is complete and the elixir’s power matures, one then knows the riding of [lacuna]—this Dao is nothing other than the mechanism of Kun’s end and Fu’s beginning. Master Wei repeatedly expounded this, and his clarity was exhaustive.\n\nTo cultivate nature and prolong life, one must reverse the sequence: first consider what comes later, then attend to what precedes. The body one inherits is originally undifferentiated, its primordial essence dispersed, its qi the foundation of its inception.\n\nBlood and qi each possess their own nature, and this nature never deviates from the upright. Blood and qi each possess their own destiny, and this destiny never strays from emotion. Yet while nature is fundamentally upright, when one loses the true nature and sinks into depravity, one may become a villain, a serpent, a scorpion, or some monstrous transformation—such are those whose nature becomes perverse. While destiny is rooted in emotion, when one awakens the mind and perceives nature, understanding that all beings owe their existence to desire, one refines essence into qi, ascends to sagehood, and transcends the mundane—such are those whose destiny becomes upright.\n\nConsider this: when a person first receives their bodily form, it is fundamentally an upright nature. Yet when parents unite in passion, is the primordial qi they disperse truly upright? Does it arise from emotion? The *Yuanjue Jing* states that destiny arises from desire—this aligns with the present discussion.\n\nYin and yang serve as the measure, the dwelling of hun and po. The yang spirit is the sun’s hun, the yin spirit the moon’s po. Hun and po mutually serve as abodes. Nature presides within, establishing the inner citadel; emotion operates without, constructing the outer walls. When the walls are complete, beings find peace.\n\nAt this time, emotion harmonizes with Qian and Kun. Qian moves and extends, its qi spreading, its essence flowing. Kun is still and receptive, becoming the Dao’s dwelling. The firm acts and retreats; the yielding transforms and nourishes. Nine returns, seven reversions, eight returns, six residences—male appears white, female appears red. Metal and fire restrain each other, then water settles. Fire, the first of the five phases, is supremely good like water—clear and flawless. The Dao’s form resembles the True One, difficult to depict. Though it transforms and disperses, each phase dwells in its own place.\n\nEmotion and nature arise from hun and po; hun and po arise from light and darkness; light and darkness arise from the sun and moon; the sun and moon arise from yin and yang. The sage infers this from Qian and Kun’s firmness and yielding, movement and stillness, opening and closing—thus the Great Elixir’s Dao accords with the *Great Change*. Its essence lies in nothing other than yin and yang as the measure.\n\nThus, when the sun rises at *Mao*, the sky brightens and hun flourishes. When the sun sets at *You*, the sky darkens and po flourishes. Hun is the yang spirit, po the yin spirit. Hun’s chamber is day, po’s dwelling is night—yet in truth, they do not transcend the two mechanisms of light and darkness.\n\nWhen people are awake in daylight, they employ hun and spirit, for hun’s essence is nature. When night falls, they return to essence and po, for essence and po are destiny. Destiny generates emotion, so essence and po become the outer walls. Nature generates the mind, so preserving the mind’s spirit becomes the inner citadel. When the walls are firm, beings find peace. At this time, when emotion operates externally, Qian and Kun unite, and the principles of firmness and yielding, movement and stillness, opening and closing are realized.\n\nThen, a single circulation of qi pervades the great void. Ascending and descending, all is transformed in undifferentiated chaos. The true earth, nine metals, eight woods, seven fires, six waters—all return and reside, each entering into earth. When they return to earth, the five phases are complete, and the myriad things are born within it. The male appears in white form, the female in red hue. The five phases gather and restrain one another: metal and fire contend, fire smelts metal, and metal encases water like boiling soup in a cauldron. The cauldron is heated in the furnace, and the metal furnace blazes. Here, water, metal, and fire are all within earth. Where there is fire, wood naturally exists. Once the transformations are complete, lead congeals and mercury coalesces within the crucible—then water’s function is the highest good.\n\nThe supreme treasure is flawless; the utmost reality is difficult to grasp. When the fire-tending is sufficient and the five phases disperse, each dwells in its own place without encroachment.\n\nLike a chicken’s egg, black and white support each other, its length and breadth a single inch—this is the beginning. The four limbs, five viscera, sinews, and bones all develop within. After ten months, it emerges from the womb, its bones pliable enough to coil, its flesh smooth as lead. Its length is an inch, its width slightly narrower. The Dharma-body resides within. The ancients...\n\nShould one ask, \"Why not leap beyond the radiance of the pearl?\"—then let the inner body surge forth, ascending straight to the Purple Tenuity Palace. The yang-burning mirror draws fire, yet without the sun, no light is born; the moonlit vessel gathers dew, yet without stars and moon, how could water be obtained? The two qi, profound and distant, still respond to transformation—how much more so when near at hand, stored within the heart and breast? Yin and yang pair as sun and moon; water and fire serve as their signs.\n\nThe *yang-sui* is a mirror forged from five-colored stone, which, when turned toward the sun with mugwort, captures fire. The *Huainanzi* calls it the \"fire vessel.\" There is also the \"water vessel,\" a moonlit orb of crystal that, when turned toward the moon, gathers fire—this is called the *yin-sui*. Without the aid of sun and moon, neither vessel can generate water or draw fire. Within the human body, the ascent and descent of yin and yang move in harmony with the transformations of heaven and earth. How could the principle of water and fire’s communion lie beyond the mechanism of the sun and moon’s ebb and flow, by which we seek verification?\n\nThe three treasures—ears, eyes, and mouth—must be firmly sealed, their apertures unopened. The Perfected One, concealed in the deep abyss, floats and drifts, abiding within the compass of the center. Whether turning or bending, seeing or hearing, opening or closing, all are governed by the self’s pivot. In movement and stillness, unceasing, the inner *qi* of *li* and *kan* nurtures defense and nourishment. The ears do not employ their acuity; the mouth does not engage in speech. Rare words follow the flow of the primordial flood. Once these three are secured, the body relaxes in an empty chamber, the will entrusted to emptiness. Absence of thought becomes the norm; the mind, undistracted, does not stray. In sleep, spirit and soul embrace; upon waking, one attends to the signs of presence and absence. The complexion gradually moistens; the bones and joints grow ever stronger. Expelling the host of yin’s perverse influences, one then establishes the true yang, cultivating it without cease. The *qi* of clouds and rain moves in gentle descent, like spring’s drizzle, like melting ice. From the head it flows to the feet, then ascends once more, circulating through the boundless. The returning glow within is the proof of the Dao; suppleness is the handle of virtue. Weeding and hoeing the long-accumulated filth, even the finest dust is smoothed away. The path of the turbid is made clear; long dimness is illuminated.\n\nIf the ears do not listen, the water of *kan* inwardly clarifies. If the eyes do not see, the fire of *li* inwardly nourishes. If the mouth does not speak, the metal of *dui* remains silent. Once these three are closed, the Perfected One roams freely within. One must employ absence of thought and worry, not indulge in toil. The will is entrusted to emptiness; the mind, undiverted, does not wander. To relax the body in an empty chamber—what other purpose is there? It is simply that one must embrace the feminine, hold to the One, and soften the body, dwelling alone in stillness. In sleep, spirit and soul embrace; upon waking, one attends to the signs of presence and absence. Then, expelling the perverse yin, pure yang accumulates within the body. Supreme harmony overflows, like melting ice, like spring’s gentle rain. The *qi* of clouds moves like mist, ascending and descending, flowing from head to feet. Cultivating this without cease, filth is wholly removed, sinews and bones harmonized, the complexion luminous, the bones and joints firm. The blood transforms into white marrow; spirit and form attain perfection. Yet once the seven gates are returned, one seems nearly lifeless: the hundred vessels sink, the form and *qi* dissolve, strength fails, and one cannot rise. Dazed and turbid, as if drunk—this is the proof of the Dao, the handle of virtue.\n\nDimness is the foundation of clarity; turbidity is the source of purity. From this point onward, round brilliance pervades, empty and penetrating, numinous and unobstructed—yet all begins in dimness and turbidity. Worldly people favor petty arts, failing to discern the depth of the Dao. They abandon the true and follow the perverse, seeking shortcuts that lead nowhere, like the blind refusing a staff, or the deaf attempting to hear the *shang* note. They fish for pheasants and hares in the water, hunt for dragons and fish on the mountain, plant wheat hoping for millet, or use a compass to seek a square. They exhaust their spirit and strength year after year, yet see no result.\n\nWould you know the method of ingesting the elixir? It is simple, not complex. Worldly people abandon the true and follow the perverse, indulging in petty arts, wasting their minds and strength until old age, yet achieving nothing. How could they know the wonder of the Great Dao, which is utterly simple, utterly easy, concise and not cumbersome?\n\nThe flowing pearl of the Great Yang ever seeks to depart from man. Should one suddenly obtain the Golden Flower, it turns and binds with it, transforming into a white liquid, congealing into something most firm. The Golden Flower first intones, and in a moment, dissolves into the Water Horse’s teeth, the langgan jade. The yang then harmonizes, and the nature of the emotions naturally hastens. When the time is right, yin gathers and restrains, the gate of compassion nurtures, the filial child repays kindness, the stern father issues commands, and the descendants are taught. The five phases clash and contend, fire’s nature melts metal, metal fells wood, and flourishing arises. The Three and Five unite with the One; heaven and earth’s purest essence can be transmitted by oral instruction but cannot be written in words.\n\nMan’s life resides in *mao*; the sun emerges from *mao*, and the myriad things depend on it for birth. Thus, all things rely on the essence of the Great Yang to establish their lives. The flowing pearl of the Great Yang is the treasure of life. When this life-treasure lodges in spirit, it flits about in confusion; confused thoughts chase after things and are transformed. When it lodges in essence, it is difficult to preserve fullness; instability leads to scattered thoughts and leaking desires. Thus it is said: \"It ever seeks to depart from man.\" Yet few among worldly people know this principle; even fewer, though they know it, can preserve it.\n\nYet the treasure of the Great Yang is fundamentally the essence of the wood-soul. If it obtains the golden radiance to subdue and master it, it transforms into a white liquid, congealing into the yellow sprout—like horse’s teeth or lustrous jade. Confined and nurtured within the Gate of *you*, it undergoes transformation. The method follows the principle of the Five Phases’ mutual consumption: as a father drives his son, as a son returns to his mother, as a mother nurtures, as a child repays kindness. Thus, one first employs fire to melt metal, then metal to fell wood—all like a stern father driving his son. Thereafter, it transforms into the Eight Waters, which are the mother of wood. Hence it is said: \"The mother nurtures.\" Once more it congeals into metal-water, which is the child of metal. The child transforms into the mother, and thus it is said: \"The child repays kindness.\" Its essentials do not exceed the Three, the Five, and the One. The Three, the Five, and the One—these three characters—are such that those who truly understand them in ancient and modern times are indeed rare. Unless one encounters a perfected person to transmit the oral instructions, how could one lightly presume to fathom the celestial mechanism through written words?\n\nAlas! Consider the mid-winter season, when grasses and trees are all withered and harmed, aiding the Yang to interrogate the traveling merchants. The noble ruler deeply conceals himself, aligning with the season’s rhythms, closing his mouth and refraining from discoursing on the Dao of Heaven—so vast, so profound, formless and boundless, invisible and unfathomable. How could one rely on mere frameworks to dispel errors and avoid the entanglements of misguided words, which only bring self-defeat? Thus, I distinguish these Four Images to enlighten later generations of the blind.\n\nAt the mid-winter season, the myriad things return to their roots. At this time, the workings of creation are inscrutable. Observing the Dao of Heaven, one finds it sealed and impassable, vast and unknowable. Examining the Great Profundity, one finds it empty and still, swirling without form. On what basis, then, could one fathom the mechanism of creation? Master Wei distinguished the Four Images to instruct later generations, as set forth in the following chapter.\n\nWhen *zi* turns right, *wu* rotates east; *mao* and *you* form the boundary between host and guest. The dragon calls to the tiger, the tiger inhales the dragon’s essence. Both feast upon each other, each coveting the other’s glory, until they interlock, swallow, chew, and devour one another. When Mars guards the west and Venus traverses the heavens, the killing energy descends—what could withstand its overthrow? The fox and dog guard against it, birds and sparrows fear the goshawk. Each fulfills its function—how dare they make a sound?\n\n*Zi* turns right to come east, *wu* rotates east to come west to *you*—each traverses nine revolutions. Thus, the dragon emerges from within fire, the tiger is born within water. Mars guards the west to restrain metal, Venus traverses the heavens and appears by day. Naturally, the dragon calls to the tiger, the tiger inhales the dragon’s essence. Master Zhongli’s poem says: \"Do not say this body is the Dao, cultivated alone; a single thing is but solitary Yin. Know that the Dao is the union of one Yin and one Yang. Only after male and female unite, essence intermingles, and the myriad things are transformed, can one speak of the Returned Elixir. If the two things do not unite, the Three and Five do not intersect, water and fire remain unbridged, hardness and softness separate—then Yin and Yang are cut off, heaven and earth sealed. This is what is called ‘partial Yin, partial Yang’—a malady indeed.\"\n\nKan (the trigram) is the male, the moon; Li is the female, the sun. The sun bestows its virtue, the moon unfurls its light. The moon receives the sun’s transformation, its body unharmed. If the Yang loses its contract, the Yin encroaches upon its brightness; at conjunction and opposition, eclipses occur, one overshadowing the other. The Yang’s form is consumed, the Yin’s calamity arises. Male and female require each other, inhaling and exhaling to nourish; female and male intermingle, seeking one another.\n\nThat by which heaven and earth endure is the sun and moon’s reciprocal movement, Yin and Yang’s mutual containment and support to emit radiance. If even one deviates from its measure, there arises the peril of eclipses. The Kan and Li of man are like the sun and moon of heaven and earth—how could one not steal the mechanism of heaven and earth?\n\nMetal transforms into water, and water’s nature is pervasive. Fire transforms into earth, and water cannot flow. Thus, the male moves and externally bestows, the female is still and internally conceals. If the overflow exceeds its measure, it is restrained by the female; the po controls the hun, preventing excess. Neither cold nor heat, advancing and retreating in timely fashion, each attains harmony and together they emit confirming signs.\n\nThis speaks of the marvel of metal-water as husband and wife, water-fire as mates. Metal generates water, and water’s nature is moist. Without earth to restrain it, there would inevitably be the peril of overflow. Wood generates fire, fire generates earth, and only when earth is generated can water be restrained, gathered, stored, and mated with fire. Thus, metal and wood, though mutually destructive, become husband and wife by virtue of fire’s power. Water and fire, though mutually destructive, become mates by virtue of earth’s power. Thereafter, advancing and retreating in timely fashion, each attains harmony and manifests transformations in accord with the season, together emitting confirming signs.\n\nCinnabar is the essence of wood. When it obtains metal, they unite; where metal and water converge, wood and fire become companions. The four intermingle in chaos, arrayed as dragon and tiger. The dragon is Yang, its number odd; the tiger is Yin, its number even. The liver, green, is the father; the lungs, white, are the mother; the kidneys, black, are the child; the spleen, yellow, is the ancestor. The child and the Five Phases begin with three things—a single family all returning to *wu* and *si*.\n\nMetal and wood—A and Geng—mutually support each other’s use, for both embrace true earth. Metal (four) and water (one) combine to transform into earth (five). Wood (three) and fire (two) combine to transform into earth (five). Though the dragon of eastern wood and the tiger of western metal—east three and west four—are odd and even, unequal, when divided into three families and united into one dwelling, they all return to *wu-si*.\n\nHardness and softness alternate in ascent, traversing the divisions. The dragon is west, the tiger east; *mao* and *you* establish the warp, punishment and virtue are both contained, and they meet in joy. Punishment governs subduing and killing, virtue governs generation and ascent. In the second month, the elm withers, the Dipper points to *mao*; in the eighth month, wheat sprouts, the Celestial Stem resides in *you*. *Zi* is south, *wu* is north, mutually serving as the guiding principles. The number one-nine ends and begins anew, containing the Primordial within the Void and Danger, sowing essence in *zi*.\n\nFrom *zi* to *si* is Qian, the hard; from *wu* to *hai* is Kun, the soft. Understanding this principle of alternating ascent, one naturally finds the dragon in the west, the tiger in the east; *zi* in the south, *wu* in the north; *mao* and *you* establishing the warp; generation and killing, ascent and subduing, mutually serving as guiding principles, each attaining its time. In the second month, generation begins, and *you* descends upon it—thus the elm dies and returns to its root. In the eighth month, killing and subduing prevail, and *mao* descends upon it—thus shepherd’s purse and wheat sprout. From *you* to *mao*, proceeding in nine revolutions, one then sees *zi* in the south. From *mao* to *you*, reversing in nine revolutions, one then sees the Void and Danger in the north. This is what is meant by \"the number one-nine contains the Primordial within the Void and Danger, sowing essence in *zi*.\"\n\nThe *guan-guan* ospreys on the river isle, the graceful and virtuous maiden—how the noble man longs for her! The male does not dwell alone, the female does not live in solitude. The dark warrior and the coiling dragon, the entwined serpents—all illustrate how male and female must rely on each other. Suppose two women share a chamber, their complexions fair, and one sends Su Qin to convey words, Zhang Yi to arrange the match, untying their braids, loosening their tongues, flaunting their eloquence, and deploying honeyed speech to persuade and harmonize, intending to unite as husband and wife. Yet even if their hair rots and their teeth decay, they will never know each other. If the medicinal substances are not of the same kind, their *qi* and essences differ, their measures and timings are misaligned, and their guiding principles lost—then even if the Yellow Emperor tends the furnace, Taiyi wields the fire, the Eight Lords pound and refine, Huainan harmonizes the mixture, a towering altar is raised, jade steps and terraces built, unicorn jerky and dried meat offered, registers held, long kneeling in prayer, spirits and deities entreated, the hundred demons beseeched, ablutions and fasting observed, all in hope of some result—it would be like using glue to mend a cauldron, salt to treat a wound, adding ice to dispel cold, or boiling water to make serpents dance. The more one does, the more perverse it becomes.\n\nThis speaks of the Dao/Way as the union of one yin and one yang; what is solely yin or solely yang is called illness. If one attains their proper pairing, without expending further effort, they naturally commune to form the sacred embryo. If one fails to attain their proper pairing, then all labor is in vain, spirit and thought squandered—nothing can be achieved, and the more one strives, the more perverse it becomes.\n\n*Explanation of the Zhouyi Cantong Qi, Middle Scroll*\n*Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n*Explanation of the Zhouyi Cantong Qi, Lower Scroll*\nBy Chen Xianwei of the Song Dynasty\n\n**Lower Scroll**\n\nIn ancient times, the sages and worthies embraced the mysterious and held fast to the true. They ingested the Nine Cauldrons, refined their transformations, concealed their traces, and merged with the depths. They nurtured essence, cultivated spirit, and communicated virtue with the Three Luminaries. Their fluids and textures, sinews and bones, became firm; all perverse influences were dispelled, and the true *qi* remained ever-present. Through long accumulation, they transformed their forms and became immortals.\n\nMoved by compassion for later generations who love the Dao, they followed the winds of antiquity, traced the outlines of past and present, and inscribed them in charts and texts to enlighten posterity. They revealed the branches and leaves while concealing the root, designating them under various names and covering them with stones. Thus, the learned scholars who obtained these works treasured them in caskets, passing them down through generations—sons following fathers, grandsons treading in their ancestors’ steps. Yet the world remained deluded, utterly without understanding. Officials abandoned their posts, farmers neglected their plows, merchants forsook their goods, and scholars of resolve impoverished their families. I grieve deeply for this.\n\nThus, I have set down these words, concise and easy to ponder, sparing in detail yet not prolix. I lay out their principles, verify their substance, and make them observable. Their measures have numbers, and by following them in sequence, one may avoid disorder. Though the language may seem tangled, its gates and apertures are clear. Those who understand will reflect deeply, applying their minds to these matters.\n\nMaster Wei, concerned that the world would not grasp these truths, again pointed to the ancient sages and worthies who embraced the mysterious and held fast to the true. None failed to ingest the Nine Cauldrons and communicate virtue with the Three Luminaries, thereby dispelling perversity, preserving the true, transforming their forms, and becoming immortals. Moved by compassion for later generations who love the Dao, he saw that those who falsely annotated and practiced the immortals’ scriptures not only lacked understanding themselves but also led their descendants into delusion. Thus, he grieved deeply and composed this scroll.\n\nNo image is greater than Heaven and Earth. The mysterious gully spans ten thousand *li*; the River Drum faces the Star Marker. The people are all alarmed; the shadow of the gnomon falsely advances, bringing nine years of misfortune. The August Emperor gazes upon it, and the king retreats to reform himself. The key has its highs and lows; harm and *qi* flee in haste. The rivers and Huai run dry, their eastward flow pouring into the sea. Heaven and Earth’s male and female wander between *zi* and *wu*, *yin* and *shen*, the ancestors of yin and yang. They emerge and enter, complete their beginnings and ends, follow the Dipper and summon the Handle, wield the balance and fix the primal record.\n\nSteam rises from Mount Zeng; the blazing fire is set below. The White Tiger sings and leads ahead; the azure fluid harmonizes behind. The Vermilion Bird soars and plays, its flying feathers five-colored. It encounters a net spread wide, pressed down and unable to rise. Its cries are mournful, like a child longing for its mother. Overturned into the boiling cauldron, its feathers and wings are crushed and broken. Before half a *ke* has passed, fish scales and manes arise. The five colors dazzle, transformations ceaseless. The cauldron bubbles and boils violently, surging without rest. Layer upon layer, they pile up like interlocking dog’s teeth. Their forms resemble midwinter ice; *langgan* jade and stalactites jut forth, tangled and interlaced, propping one another up.\n\nIn this passage, Master Wei fully reveals the mysterious gates and images to instruct others.\n\nWhen yin and yang attain their pairing, they dwell in tranquil harmony. The Green Dragon guards Room Four in spring, the Wood of *zhen* in the east. The White Tiger resides in *chou* Seven in autumn, the Metal of *dui* in the west. The Vermilion Bird is in Zhang Six in summer, the Fire of *li* in the south. When these three come to court together, their households become kin. From two substances at the root, three emerge at the end. Three and five, five and one—all gather and return to two. The governance of the above is as prescribed; the days’ numbers are also taken from the beginning.\n\nFirst white, then yellow; red and black penetrate within and without. This is called the First Cauldron, its sustenance like grains of millet. It is the natural workings, without falsehood or deception. The Dao is like the *qi* of mountains steaming on its own, rising as clouds to become rain. When mud dries, it turns to dust; when fire dies, it becomes earth. As *bo* dyes yellow, indigo turns green; as hides and leather are boiled into glue, yeast ferments into wine. Though the substances are the same, skill is difficult to apply if not of the same kind. Only this wondrous art is precise and not deceptive. Transmitted to a hundred million generations, it shines forth, verifiable as the stars crossing the Han, radiant as the source of the sea. Ponder it thoroughly, revisit it again and again. After a thousand cycles, ten thousand repetitions, it will gleam resplendently. Then one may behold it. The divine may reveal it to others, or the heart may suddenly awaken. Seek its threads, trace its beginnings, and you will find its gates and doors. The Dao of Heaven is impartial; it is always transmitted to the worthy.\n\nThe Great Elixir of the Nine Cauldrons refers to the supreme divine elixir, the great ninefold refinement. This is the peerless, most true medicine, transcending the Three Realms. Even the elixir of the First Cauldron requires the lesser ninefold refinement to complete its form, resembling grains of millet—this is the image of the mysterious pearl. Its appearance may be white, yellow, blue, black, or red, never fixed in color. It resembles a true pearl, which the ancients called the *mani* jewel, ever displaying five colors. It is also said to resemble cinnabar in form, though cinnabar is not inherently red—these are all firsthand accounts. Other false descriptions, with a thousand depictions, are self-deception. What benefit is there in speaking recklessly before understanding, thereby inviting blame? Better to diligently and earnestly seek a teacher, inquire of the Dao, and reach the place of personal witness before speaking. Even then, it is not too late. If one attains it in the body but does not speak of it, what harm is there?\n\nMaster Wei exhorts scholars to thoroughly read this book a thousand times, ten thousand times, with utmost sincerity and without negligence. Perhaps the divine will reveal it to others, or the heart will awaken on its own. Naturally, one will seek its threads and find its gates and doors. This is what is meant by \"the Dao of Heaven is impartial; it is always transmitted to the worthy.\"\n\nI once composed the *Establishing the Sacred* as the first scroll, saying: \"The Great Dao is impartial; when moved, the immortals come.\" How could these words be empty? If one does not strive to seek lead and mercury, how can one grasp the celestial mechanism and shed the sacred embryo? This is the same intent.\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* broadly expounds its outlines but cannot maintain purity; its explanations overflow, yet the subtle details remain incomplete. Omissions and gaps abound, resembling yet not quite matching. Thus, I have compiled and supplemented these records to fill the omissions, refine the obscure, and draw connections to ensure coherence. I have guarded against inconsistency in intent and direction, not deviating from the original. I have thus composed this, ordering the Five Phases and their pairings. Then the nature and essence of the *Great Change* are fully illuminated.\n\nWhen the Five Phases attain their proper unions, each has its pairing.\n\nYi (☲, Floating Left), Ding (☲, Civil Fire), Ji (Earth), Xin (☻, Common Silver), and Gui (Lead);\nThree Woods, Two Fires, Five Earths, Four Metals, and One Water.\nJia (☷, Sinking Right), Bing (☲, Martial Fire), Wu (Earth), Geng (☲, Common Gold), and Ren (Mercury).\n\nThe nature and essence of the *Great Change* each conform to their measures. The Yellow Emperor and Laozi investigated and compared them, enabling mastery of the furnace and fire arts with true foundation. Among the Three Ways, all emerge from the same path.\n\nHow vast is the Dao as Dao! It gives birth to Heaven and Earth, nurtures the myriad things, and eludes even the transformations of creation. The sage cannot name it. Fu Xi followed its measures to compose the *Yi*; the Yellow Emperor and Laozi probed its subtleties to attain the principle of emptiness and spontaneity. The furnace and fire arts steal its mechanism to obtain the method of refining gold and drying mercury. All these—whether observed in the heavens or on earth, drawn from afar or near, expressed in words, cultivated in the body, or entrusted to things—though divided into Three Ways, ultimately return to One.\n\nBranches, stems, flowers, and leaves bear fruit, yet all depend on the root. Without losing its original simplicity, the heart’s sincere words are precise and unerring. The Dao does not reside in words; words are but branches, stems, flowers, and leaves. Words guard intent, and intent bears fruit. Intent guards the Dao, and the Dao is the root. Branches and leaves are easily seen, fruit easily known, but the root is difficult to see and know. Words are easily known, intent easily guarded, yet those who attain the Dao’s subtlety are few. Yet though the root lies hidden, it reveals itself in leaves and stems; the profound Dao, though obscure, is made manifest in speech. How much more so with Master Wei’s sincere words, precise and unadorned? It rests with the scholar to delve deeply and grasp it for themselves.\n\nI, a humble man of Kuaiji, dwell in a secluded valley, embracing simplicity. I disdain glory and honor, retreat to obscurity, and disregard fame and profit. Abiding in tranquility and peace, I have composed this text, singing of the *Great Change* and the Three Sages’ legacy, examining their shared intent and unifying their discourse.\n\nMaster Wei was born in Shangyu, Kuaiji, during the Eastern Han. Embracing simplicity and disregarding fame and profit, he dwelled in seclusion to study the Dao, silently cultivating truth. Though his teacher’s name is unknown, he delved deeply into the profound, attaining the mysteries of the Great One’s Fire Talisman, the Golden Liquor, the Nine Revolutions, and the Great Return’s divine elixir. Having benefited himself, he sought to benefit others, composing this text to enlighten later learners. His merit is great, his virtue abundant, yet he still humbly called himself coarse and decayed. How modest was this perfected man!\n\nThis work aligns with the intent and great unity of the *Great Change* composed by the Three Sages, hence its title, *Cantong Qi*.\n\nIts purpose lies in following principle, illuminating the spirit, and ensuring the circulation of divine transformation, bringing peace to the Four Seas and serving as a model for ten thousand generations. It can be applied to governance without complexity, guiding inner cultivation to align with the Yellow Emperor and Laozi’s natural Way, embodying the profound virtue of returning to the root and reverting to the origin—close at hand within the heart, inseparable from the self. Embracing the One without abandonment ensures longevity. Combined with dietary practices—arranging the male and female, refining and subduing Wudu’s eight minerals—one discards what the world treasures.\n\nThose who read this book must follow the principle of the *Great Change*’s mutual resonance, seeking it within themselves. If the text’s discussions of divine transformations and changes are returned to the subtleties of spirit and heart, then the wonder of entering the spirit and applying it is attained. Once this wonder is attained, the immortal Dao is achieved. Yet not only those who study immortality and the Dao rely on this book. If applied to governance, its practice is effortless, and the Four Seas are at peace. If used as a model for calendrics, divine transformation flows, and ten thousand generations follow it. If employed for inner cultivation, it harmonizes with the Yellow Emperor and Laozi’s natural Way, containing the virtue of returning to truth and reverting to the origin. Paired with dietary practices, it arranges the male and female, refining and subduing them. But the world must not mistake these for external medicines. If recklessly treated as external medicines, refining and ingesting Wudu’s realgar, the Four Spirits, and the eight minerals, one strays far from the Dao. Yet if their use is carefully applied to the furnace and fire arts, one can refine common silver into gold and dry mercury into silver, which the world may treasure.\n\nThree paths are arrayed, their branches connected, emerging under different names yet all from one gate. This is no mere accumulation of parallel phrases or harmonious couplets; the text contains true substance, worthy of contemplation. Had I fabricated falsehoods, I would have incurred praise and blame, but I have titled it *Cantong Qi*, glimpsing its subtleties. Its words are few, its intent vast. Later generations should follow it, casting off harm, relying on mountains, wandering the vast expanse, and befriending immortals. Transforming the body to become immortal, they will roam in silence, descending to the human world once in a hundred generations, displaying their feathered wings, soaring east and west, south and north. Though Yao and Tang suffered calamities—floods and droughts—separating them, with branches and leaves withering and losing their splendor, the auspicious person rides upon them, secure and stable, attaining long life.\n\nThis book’s three chapters largely share similar beginnings and endings. Master Wei expounded the elixir path repeatedly, reiterating his words so that learners might grasp the coherence from start to finish. Thus, he said this book’s three paths are like branches connected, their words and metaphors differing as if emerging from separate roads, yet in truth, they are one gate. How could this be mere harmonious couplets or accumulated phrases for elegant recitation? It truly contains profound principles, worthy of contemplation. Hence, he titled it *Cantong Qi*.\n\nHaving revealed this book to later generations, Master Wei himself became an immortal. Casting off the harms of the age, he relied on mountains, transformed his form, and ascended as an immortal. Even a hundred generations later, he roams the human world, playing in the Three Realms, pointing to the mysterious gate, and delivering all beings. Has he not displayed his feathered wings, aiding others when convenient?\n\nHow is this different from Confucius’ Ten Wings of the *Yi*? Could Master Wei ever have forgotten the world for a day?\n\nMaster Wei’s intent lies in uniting the Three Things—eastern Wood, southern Fire, and western Metal—into one household, as in the previous chapter’s meaning of the Three Coming to Court. He enables people to seek coherence in the text.\n\nAfter attaining the Dao, one has a body outside the body. Like the auspicious person riding upon them, they are free in all directions. Though in Yao’s floods or Tang’s great droughts, with all things withering and seas turning to mulberry fields, their numinous essence rides the true gold Dharma-body, coming and going freely, entering and exiting without obstruction. This is true security and long life.\n\nThe cauldron’s body is one foot and five inches in circumference, symbolizing the Three and Five. Its circumference is fifteen, its diameter five inches. The Three and Five refer to: east Three, south Two (one Five); center Five, Two, Three; north One, west Four (Three Fives). Originally, the Great Ultimate (○) contains the wonder of the Three and Five, transforming the Five Phases into the Three and Five, and the Three and Five into One (○). The wonder of the golden elixir is fully contained here, hence the cauldron’s symbolism.\n\nThe cauldron measures one *cun* and one *fen* in thickness, with a mouth of four by eight—combining the Four Symbols and Eight Trigrams to make twelve. The mouth’s circumference is one *chi* and two *cun*, symbolizing the twelve hours of a day, circulating through twelve positions without ever leaving the cauldron’s mouth. A two-*cun* lip: the cauldron’s lip is two *cun* thick, resembling two layers, evoking the form of the Qian and Kun dual forces and the bellows’ shape, much like a person with double lips.\n\nTwelve in height: the cauldron stands one *chi* and two *cun* tall, symbolizing the twelve months of a year, representing the full cycle of fire-times within a single cauldron. From the eleventh month, when yang is born anew at the cauldron’s base by one *cun*, to the completion of a full year, the cauldron is filled. Even in thickness: the cauldron’s upper and lower parts are uniformly thick, signifying the stable placement of the furnace and cauldron without any bias or unevenness.\n\nA level belly of three: when positioning the cauldron, it must be perfectly aligned so that the mouth, center, and belly are all level—only then can there be no risk of tilting. Seated and warmly suspended: the cauldron mirrors the human body, and the human body mirrors the cauldron. When the mouth aligns with the center and the center with the belly, one sits in warm suspension, applying fire gently—this is the so-called \"warm lead cauldron.\"\n\nYin above, yang rushing below...\n\nAt head and tail, martial; at the center, civil:\nWhen advancing yang fire, *zi*, *chou*, and *yin* serve as the head, while *chen* and *si* serve as the tail;\nwhen retreating yin tally, *wu*, *wei*, and *shen* serve as the head, while *xu* and *hai* serve as the tail.\nAt both head and tail, martial fire is employed; upon reaching the Central Palace for bathing, civil fire is used.\n\nBeginning with seventy, ending with three decades:\nThe work of a hundred days begins and ends—by then, the sacred embryo is already formed.\n\nThree hundred and sixty, harmoniously regulated:\nAfter a hundred days, one must carefully regulate for another two hundred and sixty days;\nwhen the fire-tending is complete, two hundred and sixty days fulfill the work of a full year.\n\nYin fire, white sprout, lead of the Yellow Sprout:\nThe *Zhenjun* of Yin’s poem says, “When fire-tending meets yin, it becomes *Tai Bai*.”\nYin is black; within black, white is employed—within yin, yang is used.\nOnly when the supreme treasure encounters yin fire does it transform into the Yellow Sprout, born from the black lead of the northern quarter.\n\nTwo sevens gather to assist and uphold the person:\nThe *Shenshi Ge* of the *Zhenjun* of Yin says, “The golden crucible of the Later Earth gives birth to life and death, ever seven.”\nSeven is the completion number of fire.\nWhat is prized in the realm of life also uses seven; the realm of death likewise uses seven.\nThus it is said, “Life and death, ever seven.”\nWhen fire is applied without error in the two realms of yin and yang, the two fires gather and naturally assist and uphold the true person within.\n\nNourishing the brain, settling the ascent, the child of the Mysterious guards within to attain peace and preservation:\nThe infant within the crucible clings to the Mysterious and abides;\nwhen the Heavenly Mysterious is above, the infant follows its ascent, cherishing the guard to dwell in peace.\nDo not attach to external realms.\nTo know the true intent: face the Northern Dipper, guard the south.\n\nThe comings and goings wander not beyond the gate, gradually forming great nature and pure disposition.\nSeal and secure the subtle and secret, allowing no fear of leakage—thus the sacred body gradually grows while nature and disposition become ever purer.\n\nReturning to the One, restoring the original source:\nWhen the sacred embryo is complete and the fire-phase ends, one returns to the One and restores the source.\n\nA full cycle is most arduous; guard closely, guard against confusion and dullness.\nA year’s fire-phase is exceedingly strenuous; for those who cultivate and refine, it is especially essential to guard closely, to remain vigilant and unwavering.\n\nThe path is distant and profoundly mysterious.\nAn elder’s poem says:\n*“A grain of returned elixir, large as a fist—\nwhen men take it, they ascend as immortals.\nLet not the slightest dust of worldly ties\nblock the eight-thousand-league road to Penglai.”*\n\nIf one attains this guard, the qi of Heaven and Earth is refined, and the hun and po are purified.\nOnly upon reaching this stage in cultivation can one comprehend the principle of guarding Heaven and Earth, stealing the transformative mechanism of Nature, daily partaking of the refined essence to make the hun, po, and spirit sacred.\n\nThose who delight in the Dao seek its root, examining the five phases to determine precise measures.\nThis principle does not transcend the five phases. If one loves the Dao and explores the mysterious, seeking its root and scrutinizing the subtleties of the five phases to determine the weight of each measure, then one may silently grasp it without awaiting oral transmission—self-realization comes through devoted focus, intent contemplation, and profound meditation.\n\nPonder deeply; no need to discuss it.\nFor those who study the Dao, if they can awaken through texts, they must transmit it in writing. Yet leaking the celestial mechanism is perilous—it must be deeply concealed and guarded, lest one incur the blame of careless disclosure.\n\nRiding a white crane, driving a dragon-scale chariot,\nroaming the Great Void to visit the Primordial Lord,\nreceiving the celestial chart and being named a true person—\nafter the elixir is complete, the white crane and dragon scales are within me, and spiritual powers naturally transform, not derived from external sources.\n\nYet some in the world, ignorant of cultivation, accumulating merit, and amassing virtuous deeds to attain immortality, vainly long for the true with day and night yearning, awaiting a heavenly decree—how mistaken! Some are deluded by demons, swayed by malevolent spirits, transformed into dragon carriages and phoenix chariots, riding clouds and mist, only to ultimately fall prey to fox and goblin illusions. How could they know that transformations from within oneself are authentic, while those from without are never free from the taint of the strange and demonic? Let scholars take heed.\n\n**Postscript**\nMany alchemical scriptures and purple texts circulate in the world.\n\nOnly Wei Boyang, following the *Jinbi Longhu Jing* (\"Scripture of Gold and Azure, Dragon and Tiger\"), composed the *Cantong Qi* (\"Kinship of the Three\") under the guise of the *Yi*’s images, expounding the methods of elixir-crafting with unparalleled precision and detail. The songs of the Perfected Lü once declared:\n*\"Gold and Azure, the Kinship of the Three—timeless,\nWondrous within wondrous, mysterious within mysterious.\"*\nGao Xiangxian’s poem likewise proclaimed:\n*\"Gold and Azure, Dragon and Tiger, the Kinship of the Three,\nLeft as the eternal sovereign of elixirs through the ages.\"*\nSuch praise is indeed the highest.\n\nIn the former Yue Prefecture, there once existed a commentary by Peng Zhenyi. I once obtained it and pored over it countless times, yet its language was abstruse and its meaning obscure, impossible to fathom. Among the rivers and lakes, those who study immortality all regarded this as a flaw, sighing only: *\"How profound is the Dao!\"*\n\nIn the year *jiachen* (1244), during the eleventh lunar month, by fortunate karmic connection, I encountered Master Baoyi, Chen Jun, in Dayun of Shanyin. The following summer, on the full moon of the fifth month, I met him again at the Yousheng Abbey in his residence. The Master then said to me: *\"If you are devoted to the Dao, you should further establish merit for it. Once, at the request of a friend, I composed a commentary on the* Cantong Qi*. The words therein directly reveal the secrets of the elixir, leaving no hidden mechanisms. My intent was to open the path for later learners, preventing them from stumbling in darkness, and I dared not employ the cryptic language of ancient texts. If you could arrange for its transmission, would that not be a great act of goodness?\"*\n\nHaving received the book, I read it by lamplight in quietude, and the mysteries of the profound became luminously clear before my eyes. Not only was the original intent of Master Wei’s text vividly illuminated, but even those secrets guarded by all the scriptures—never before dared to be spoken—were here laid bare. Raising my hands in praise, I declared: *\"My Master is the very embodiment of utmost compassion, and this book is the guiding compass for all who read the* Cantong Qi*.\"*\n\nWith reverence, I gathered those of karmic affinity to carve it into woodblocks, hoping that through successive transmission and mutual exchange, all of like mind might peruse it. Through its words, they may awaken to understanding and swiftly ascend to the true mystery. Yet should there remain those unable to fully grasp its profound subtleties, awaiting the personal instruction of a teacher, they may still stray into heterodox paths, deviant arts, or speculative theories that seem correct but are in truth false—such is the source of confusion and delusion.\n\nTo later readers, I earnestly urge: proceed with care.\n\n*Chunyu* (1245), mid-autumn, the first day of the month.\n*Disciple Tiantai Sheng bows and respectfully inscribes.*\n\n*Postscript*\n\nI have often heard the poem by the eminent scholar Gao Xiangxian:\n\n*\"Golden Splendor, Dragon-Tiger, the* Cantong Qi*,\nLeft as the eternal sovereign of the elixir’s realm.\"*\n\nFrom ancient times to the present, immortals have revered the *Cantong Qi* as the progenitor of all elixir methods. Long ago, there existed the *Scripture of Golden Splendor and Dragon-Tiger*, its words few but its meaning profound—so abstruse that none could fathom it. Then, in the Han dynasty, Master Wei Boyang of Shangyu in Yue unfolded its teachings into the *Cantong Qi*. Today, the public archives of Yue still circulate it, though only Peng Xiao’s commentary is deemed a fine edition. Yet with the passage of eras and the vicissitudes of time, what now circulates is no longer Peng’s authentic text. Only its preface and the *Bright Mirror Diagram* preserve Master Wei’s original intent; as for the various other commentaries, they all graft heterodox paths onto the true teaching. Thus, Zhang Pingshu lamented that later generations would recklessly annotate the immortal classics—such is indeed the case.\n\nMaster Baoyi, Chen Jun, traveled from Huai to Zhe, and scholars questioned him on the authenticity of this text. For in this world, those who delight in the strange may dismiss the *Cantong Qi* as a forgery, much as they do with the present-day *Yi of the Cassock*. My teacher served Master Baoyi the longest and personally heard his profound discourses: Master Wei styled himself Boyang, but in truth, he was the incarnate transformation of the Old Master (Laozi). The *Cantong Qi*’s diction is archaic, yet it fully expounds the true mechanism—indeed, it is Master Wei’s own words, beyond what any ordinary person could compose. It is like the *Yi of the Cassock*, which is in fact Chen Xiyi’s record of the Cassock Master’s teachings, not something a mundane Confucian could articulate. Yet some falsely claim it as their own work, misleading later generations—this is to covet Heaven’s merit, and how could they not incur Heaven’s wrath?\n\nUpon hearing these words, my heart melted and my doubts dissolved. I entreated Master Baoyi to annotate the text, but he was indifferent to worldly affairs and could not be troubled by brush and ink. Thus, I occasionally presented him with one or two passages, seeking elucidation of their intent. Over the years, the full commentary was at last completed. With reverence, I commissioned woodblock carvers to transmit it to those of like mind.\n\nAh! The *Scripture of Golden Splendor* awaited the *Cantong Qi* to be revealed, and the *Cantong Qi* awaited Master Baoyi’s explication to be illuminated—just as the *Spring and Autumn Annals* had the *Zuo Commentary*, and then awaited Du Yu’s annotations. Heaven, in its compassion for those who cultivate the Dao, brought forth this master in our age to unveil the secret mysteries of the elixir scriptures. Scholars must guard and transmit these teachings with care, lest they incur the reproach of frivolous disclosure or negligent profanation. I offer this solemn prayer.\n\n*First day of the first month, the inaugural year of the Duanping era (1234).*\n*Xiweizi Wang Yi, burning incense and bowing twice, pledges with a sincere heart.*\n\n*Colophon to the* Zhouyi Cantong Qi Jie*, Scroll Three.*",

Xianwei, styled Zongdao and self-styled Baoyi Zi, was a native of Huaiyang and a Daoist of the Yousheng Abbey in Lin’an during the Jiading and Duanping eras. This work was published in the first year of the Duanping era by his disciple Wang Yi. Xianwei himself wrote the preface. The arrangement of the text follows that of Peng Xiao’s edition, and the \"Song of the Cauldron and Vessel,\" a single poem, is also appended at the end of the juan after Peng’s version. However, while the text is divided into three pian, it is not further subdivided into chapters, adhering instead to Ge Hong’s *Biographies of Divine Transcendents*. The seventy characters beginning with \"Resembling the midwinter node\" were placed under \"Branches, Stalks, and Leaves\" in both Peng’s edition and Chen Zhixun’s version, but in this edition, they are moved beneath the section \"The Flowing Pearl of Grand Yang.\" This rearrangement was made by Xianwei on the basis of the text’s separate discourse on the Four Images. At that time, theories of misplaced bamboo slips were in vogue, and figures such as Wang Bo successively fanned the flames, their waves of distortion extending even to esoteric arts.\n\nNevertheless, for its detailed and lucid exegesis, this work stands as one of the finer editions among the various commentaries on the *Cantong Qi*.

      "translated_text": "Forms and images, though enduring, must eventually decay—yet Heaven and Earth do not decay, for they are the gathering of things. Essence and radiance, though lasting, must eventually disperse—yet the sun and moon do not disperse, for they are the adornment of things. Wood, fire, earth, and water, though substantial, must ultimately perish—yet true gold does not perish, for it is the essence of things. Sand, stone, grasses, and trees, though vital, may die—yet the true elixir does not die. Thus, Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, true gold, and the true elixir are all the most numinous of things. Therefore, the Daoist appellation of the Golden Elixir is not idly chosen. The Golden Elixir takes Heaven and Earth as its body and models the sun and moon in its function. Heaven and Earth are the sky and land of our bodies; Kan and Li are the sun and moon of our bodies. When Heaven and Earth ascend and descend, there are seasons; when Kan and Li unite, there is mechanism. The supreme treasure is refined, and once attained, it is attained forever—this is why it neither decays nor disperses, neither perishes nor dies.\n\nGreat indeed is the Way of the Golden Elixir! It encompasses emptiness and embraces the earth, transcends numbers and surpasses form—unlike the other three thousand six hundred schools of illusory arts, which can only gaze upon it from afar. The ancient sages revered the treasure of the Dao and feared its leakage to the unworthy, so they concealed it in their hearts and did not inscribe it on bamboo or silk. In the Later Han, Wei Boyang lamented the near-extinction of the great Dao and pitied the lack of teachers among aspiring scholars. Thus, he took the ancient text *Jinbi Longhu Jing* as his basis, borrowing its imagery and metaphors to expound and elaborate, unfolding the secrets of the elixir to enlighten the unenlightened. He titled it *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*. Its words are archaic, its meaning profound, and readers find it difficult to comprehend. Xu Congshi, Zhang Su, and Peng Zhenyi all once wrote commentaries on it, but of these, only Peng’s remains extant today. Though his exegesis is detailed, the true mechanism remains obscure. Recent vulgar interpretations have further appended heterodox methods, compounding Peng’s errors and misleading later learners—rendering it unworthy of study.\n\nMaster Chen of the Embracing Unity school, endowed with innate brilliance and penetrating insight into the origin of nature and destiny, encountered a perfected being in Duliang of Huai in the guiwei year of Jiading. There, he fully attained the true mechanism of the Golden Elixir. In the early years of Baoyou, he came to the capital, where, with a heart of compassion, he guided and uplifted later generations. Only then did he obtain the *Cantong Qi* and read it, resolving all doubts without remainder. Thereafter, he dismissed all companions and entered seclusion to cultivate and refine. After more than a year, his merit deepened and his Dao became ever more manifest. Thus, he set down in writing the teachings derived from his personal practice and realization. His explanations delve into the subtlest details, and his elucidations of meaning are effortless yet luminous—like Cai Mo’s discernment of the divine dragon or He Shi’s identification of true jade. The path of the elixir now has a reliable foundation.\n\nFormerly, Master Cheng of Yichuan said that the three most difficult things in the world are: governing a state to the point of praying for eternal mandate, nurturing the body to the point of longevity, and learning to the point of sagehood. Though their functions differ, their achievement is one—all capable of wresting control from creation. Yet the Master’s Dao does not merely nurture the body.\n\nIf later learners can thoroughly savor this work, delving deeply to attain realization for themselves, they will then understand that the Master’s so-called Dao transcends what words and texts can convey. As the *Yijing* says: *\"To divine the numinous and make it manifest depends on the person.\"* I have humbly listened to the Master’s teachings on the ultimate, and for a long time, I have been privy to his intent in writing. Here, I record his name: Chen Xianwei, styled Zongdao, later known as Shaowei. A native of Huaiyang, he is also called Master Embracing Unity. His works *Lisheng Pian*, *Xianwei Zhiyan*, and *Baoyizi Shu* circulate in the world.\n\nWritten in the summer, the fifth month, the first year of Duangping of the Song, by the Daoist of the Heavenly Wall of the Golden Flower Cave, Zheng Boqian, who bows reverently to inscribe this preface.\n\nGreat indeed is the Dao!",

      "translated_text": "The workings of creation cannot be defied; the divine and sagely cannot fathom them. Heaven and Earth rely upon it to give life, yet even the sage cannot name it. It cannot be conceived by the heart, nor discussed in words; it cannot be known by wisdom, nor grasped by understanding. If one guards it with one’s nature, it remains as distant as heaven and abyss—how much more so for those who seek it with emotion?\n\nYet when the Dao gives birth to the One, and the One comes into being, the Dao may then be attained and its numinosity made manifest. The One is the undifferentiated thing formed before Heaven and Earth came to be. How great is the One! It is the mother of Heaven and Earth, the root of creation, the ancestor of the myriad things. Though all things possess this One, they ultimately cannot long endure. As Guan, the Gatekeeper, and Yin Xi said: \"Heaven and Earth establish the principle, and the One is contained within each thing. Every thing contains it—thus each thing, each body, possesses its own Heaven and Earth.\"\n\nMoreover, within the human body, yin and yang, nature and destiny, hun and po, waking and sleeping, movement and stillness, life and death—all these are dualities. Each possesses the One, yet where does it truly reside? Laozi said: \"When the One is attained, all affairs are complete.\" The One is the Golden Elixir. The Golden Elixir is the wondrous Dao of returning to the root, restoring the origin, reverting to the source, and recovering destiny. The Elixir guards the union of Qian and Kun, the clustering of Kan and Li, the harmony of yin and yang, the conjoining of male and female, causing the two to transform and return to the One. From this arise the Nine Palaces, the Eight Trigrams, the Seven Governors, the Six Positions, the Five Phases, the Four Images, and the Three Powers—all born of the two, yet all ultimately returning to the One.\n\nOnly then is the Elixir guarded. The \"gold\" in Golden Elixir refers to the extremity of the Five Phases. The Five Phases generate one another, reaching their culmination in metal. Heaven gives birth to water, water to wood, wood to fire, fire to earth, and earth to metal—metal is the last to be generated, completing the qi of the Five Phases and fulfilling the function of creation. Metal is a treasure: when smelted, it yields water; when struck, it yields fire. Its softness resembles wood, its color resembles earth. It encompasses the four natures of water, fire, earth, and wood. It endures ten thousand years without decay and grows ever harder through a hundred refinements. It is the ultimate treasure of pure yang, firm and strong. Heaven possesses pure yang, hence it is said that Qian is metal. The One possesses pure yang, hence it is called the Golden Elixir. The spirit possesses pure yang, hence it is called the Golden Immortal. Their principle is one.\n\nThe Buddhists speak of the four great elements—earth, water, fire, and wind—provisionally combined. Through cultivation, they attain the adamantine body and immeasurable longevity. Yet earth, water, fire, and wind correspond to earth, water, fire, and wood, which are not firm and thus easily decay. Only the firm and dense body is the indestructible vajra—this, too, is the same Dao. Hence the Elixir is named after gold.\n\nThe sages knew that the two could return to the One, and the One could return to the Dao. Thus they attained the principles of nine returns, seven reversions, eight reunions, six residences, the gathering of five, the clustering of four, the guarding of three, and the union of two. Broadly applied, this encompasses the 365 degrees of the celestial sphere, the twenty-eight lunar lodges, the seventy-two seasonal divisions, the twelve terrestrial branches, the eight solar terms, the four seasons—all that creation encompasses is harmonized within the function of the Golden Elixir. Who but the most divine and sagely of the world could know this? Though the celestial mechanism is secret, each generation has not lacked those who understand it. It lies in the subtlety of a single thought, which can move Heaven and Earth.\n\nIf a person’s good roots are pure and unified, their heart set on the Dao, and they abandon worldly affairs to seek liberation, diligently studying the true Dao, poring over the classics of immortals, exhausting the canons of sages, humbly seeking friends, and earnestly seeking teachers, they will surely encounter a perfected being who transmits the oral instructions. Those who are devoted to the Dao yet do not encounter such a teacher exist, but those who encounter one without devotion have never been known.\n\nThe true immortals and supreme sages have composed many scriptures to instruct later learners. Only Wei Boyang of the Eastern Han, basing his work on the *Yijing*, wrote the *Cantong Qi* in three chapters, which alone exhausts the mysteries of the profound and conveys the lifeblood of the ultimate Dao, expounding the marrow of the Great Elixir. In recent times, students of the Dao rarely see the ancient texts, but now that this book has been obtained, it may be called the ancestor of elixir scriptures. Its discussions are thorough and precise, concealing the celestial mechanism; its methods are subtle yet clearly displayed, arranging the images of the law.\n\nSince this scripture was written, commentators through the ages have been many, yet none have fully grasped Master Wei’s original intent. Zhang Ziyang deeply lamented that later generations, deluded and reckless, presumptuously annotated the sacred teachings of the former sages. He sighed at the errors in the commentaries on this book.\n\nAlas! The Great Medicine of the Golden Elixir is difficult to encounter, difficult to meet—it is not a worldly matter. What this book describes is most profound and secret, not a worldly method. If one has not met a perfected teacher or penetrated its depths, and merely relies on broad reading to recklessly interpret the sacred scriptures, will this not profane the lofty immortals, mislead later learners, and incur the shame of groundless fabrication?\n\nI have been fortunate to encounter a true teacher and have studied for many years. Each time I read this book, I admire its detailed and comprehensive exposition. After entering the chamber to undertake the great work, I have wandered among people, taking pleasure in visiting friends and meeting companions, discerning the worthy from the foolish, and examining the upright from the perverse. I grieve that in recent times, those who attain the Dao are rare, and those who awaken to the truth are few. Even when the celestial mechanism is revealed, it is not easily understood.\n\nTwo or three Daoist friends, hearing of this, urged me to annotate it, saying: \"This book has been obscure for a thousand years. The commentaries of various schools are not worth reading, and those who understand the Dao are rarely seen. If you do not annotate it, who will elucidate Master Wei’s teachings?\" I replied: \"Did not Master Wei say, 'Read it a thousand times, ten thousand times, and the numinous will naturally reveal itself to you'? It lies in the learner’s diligence—what need is there for superfluous words? Moreover, I am idle and indolent, passing my days in laziness. How could I find time for brush and ink?\"\n\nAfterward, these two or three friends would often discuss the Dao with me, citing one or two passages and asking for explanations. Over eight or nine years in Qiantang, I orally expounded the book without realizing it was nearly complete. One day, they recorded it and showed it to me, noting that a few sections were incomplete and asking me to fill them in to complete the earlier text, and also to write a preface. I commended their sincerity and casually added annotations, then wrote this preface on the Golden Elixir.\n\nWritten on the full moon of the second month in the first year of Duangping of the Song, by Chen Xianwei, styled Shaowei, known as Master Embracing Unity.",

Without the divine chamber, there would be no way to refine the elixir; without Qian and Kun, there would be no way to perceive the *Changes*. Qian and Kun are hexagrams of pure substance. The Six Children break this pure substance to form hexagrams.\n\nMaster Layman Ma said: \"When Qian and Kun intermingle, the Six Children are born.\" The Six Children are the broken forms of Qian and Kun. Thus, the Six Children arise from Qian and Kun, and the sixty-four hexagrams likewise emerge from Qian and Kun. Hence, they are called the father and mother of all hexagrams. The essence of the father and mother is originally pure yang and pure yin. With the birth of the Six Children, the forms of pure yang and pure yin are broken—how could they remain pure?\n\nChen Tuan said: \"Refine the broken form to restore the pure form.\" From this, we know that refining the broken form can return it to the pure form and enter the Dao.

      "translated_text": "Within our bodies lie Qian and Kun. To refine the Great Elixir, first establish Qian and Kun as the divine chamber. Once the divine chamber is set, transformations occur within it. Kan and Li serve as the encompassing frame, turning the hub with the axle in place. With Qian and Kun thus established, yin and yang naturally interact—Kun below uniting with Qian to form Kan, and Qian above uniting with Kun to form Li. When Kan and Li are complete, transformations again occur within them.\n\nChen Tuan said: \"The sun is the celestial qi, descending from the west to unite with earth; the moon is the terrestrial qi, ascending from the east to unite with heaven—this is the image of male and female conjoining in essence. Through the sun and moon’s movements, cold and heat arise, the four seasons take form, day and night divide, and yin and yang are determined. Yet heaven and earth do not themselves produce cold and heat—they arise from the sun and moon’s distance. Heaven and earth do not themselves produce the four seasons—they arise from the sun and moon’s north-south positions. Heaven and earth do not themselves produce day and night—they arise from the sun and moon’s rising and setting. Heaven and earth do not themselves produce darkness and light—they arise from the sun and moon’s mutual concealment. Though yin and yang are subtle, they do not transcend the sun and moon; though creation is vast, it does not transcend Kan and Li. Thus, though the changes of the many hexagrams are not uniform, they do not depart from the central lines of Kan and Li, which circulate through the six positions—just as the spokes of a wheel, though varied, do not depart from the turning of a single hub at its center. The central lines of Kan and Li refer to the one yang within Kan and the one yin within Li, which move up and down within the six lines. Laozi said: 'Thirty spokes share one hub—it is where there is nothing that the usefulness of the wheel lies.' Those who attain the Dao turn the sun and moon within their bodies, while ordinary people, ignorant of this principle, violate the yin and yang of creation and thus cannot avoid the peril of broken moats or the fault of lost spokes. What, then, do they possess of the encompassing frame or the true axle?\n\nThe four hexagrams of Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li serve as the bellows and key, covering and enveloping the Dao of yin and yang—just as a skilled charioteer follows the marking line, holds the reins, aligns the compass and square, and follows the wheel tracks, governing the center to control the exterior. Qian is pure yang, a male hexagram; Kun is pure yin, a female hexagram. Kan is yin containing yang, and Li is yang containing yin—these are the hexagrams of male and female union, hence called the four hexagrams of male and female. The other sixty hexagrams, whether with partial yin above or partial yang below, or partial yang above or partial yin below, are not pure in yin and yang and do not unite male and female, so they cannot be called male and female. Only these four hexagrams cover and envelop the Dao of yin and yang, serving as the bellows and key. Qian and Kun are the essence of the bellows and key, while Kan and Li are their function. Knowing the essence and function of these four hexagrams is like a craftsman following the marking line to meet the compass and square, or a charioteer holding the reins to follow the wheel tracks—governing the principle within to master the subtleties without. Then, all actions will be free from error, and every movement will accord with nature.\n\nIn the reckoning of pitch pipes and calendars, the monthly nodes have five or six divisions, and the warp and weft, serving the sun, combine to make sixty. Hard and soft have exterior and interior. Within the calendar, one month has thirty days, and the remaining sixty hexagrams beyond the four of male and female fittingly correspond to these days. Each day is served by two hexagrams—one as warp, one as weft. From morning’s *Zhun* and evening’s *Meng*, morning’s *Xu* and evening’s *Song*, to *Jiji* and *Weiji*, the hexagrams’ inner and outer, hard and soft forms—morning above and evening below, hard on the exterior and soft within—together with the preceding four hexagrams, complete the sixty-four hexagrams of the *Zhouyi*, all for our use. Thus, the Dao of the Great Elixir can be investigated through the *Yi*, and this is why the *Cantong Qi* was composed.\n\nAt the new moon’s dawn, *Zhun* presides over affairs, and by dusk, *Meng* is received. Day and night each govern one hexagram, used in sequence. When the end of the month’s darkness is reached, the cycle begins anew, with the day and hour as the measure. Movement and stillness have early and late. Master Ma Yi said: \"The waxing and waning of images do not stop at words; beyond words, meaning is revealed—only then is the Dao of the *Yi* truly understood.\" He also said: \"Hexagrams have inversions and oppositions, which are most critical. When the inverted form is profound, the opposite form is especially subtle.\" *Zhun* is a hexagram, and its inversion is *Meng*. From *Xu* and *Song* onward, all follow the inverted order. For hexagrams like *Yi* and *Xiaoguo*, which cannot be inverted, the opposite form is used instead. Thus, after *Yi* comes *Daguo*, which is its opposite—this is the opposite form. From the new moon’s dawn, using *Zhun* and *Meng*, to the month’s end, using *Jiji* and *Weiji*, the cycle turns endlessly, beginning anew. From this, we see that morning is yang and evening is yin, day is movement and night is stillness, near and far alternate, host and guest shift, waxing and waning follow, advancing and retreating proceed, life and death arise, fire is added and withdrawn—avoiding even the slightest error in timing, distinguishing the subtlest difference in withdrawing or adding, discerning floating and sinking, and applying with careful attention to dawn and dusk. Scholars, by contemplating the images, seek the meaning; having grasped the meaning, they may forget the images.\n\nThe *Wuzhen Pian* poem says:\n*\"Within this, grasp the meaning and seek no images;\nTo exhaust the many lines is but to weary the mind.\"*\nThis is the truth.\n\nIn spring and summer, rely on the inner body, from *Zi* to *Chen* and *Si*; in autumn and winter, employ the outer use, from *Wu* to *Xu* and *Hai*. Hexagrams have inner and outer bodies: the inner trigram of three lines models the year’s spring and summer, and the half-day from *Zi* to noon; the outer trigram of three lines models the year’s autumn and winter, and the half-day from noon to *Zi*. The inner trigram models yang, the outer trigram models yin—this is the image of Qian and Kun in harmonious exchange. Spring and summer nurture yang; autumn and winter nurture yin. After *Zi*, fire is advanced; after noon, the tally is withdrawn—the principle is one and the same.\n\nRewards and punishments correspond to spring and autumn; dawn and dusk follow cold and heat. The line statements contain benevolence and righteousness, manifesting with the seasons; joy and anger respond to the four seasons and five phases, attaining their principle. Reward is yang, punishment is yin; benevolence is yang, righteousness is yin; joy is yang, anger is yin. In the morning, yang is enacted to correspond to spring and summer; in the evening, yin is enacted to correspond to autumn and winter. If one can respond fittingly to the four seasons, one naturally attains the principle of the five phases—not through the petty actions of meting out rewards and punishments, hastily practicing benevolence and righteousness, or feigning joy and anger. Master Wei used this merely as a metaphor for the life and death of yin and yang. How much more so for the elixir, which is the essence of utmost yang? If even a trace of yin qi remains unrefined, it will ultimately fail to achieve completion. Those who cultivate the truth must be cautious in movement and stillness, speech and silence.\n\nThe qualities of cherishing life, benefiting others, kindness, forgiveness, generosity, love, loyalty, trust, harmony, joy, purity, tranquility, truthfulness, and sincerity—all these are yang. The qualities of killing, harming others, cruelty, jealousy, resentment, greed, stinginess, oppression, arrogance, harshness, obstinacy, lust, deceit, and falsity—all these are yin. Abandon yin and cultivate yang, and yin will naturally perish. When yin is exhausted and yang is pure, one naturally becomes true.",

      "translated_text": "The heavens and earth establish their positions, and the *Yi* (Changes) operates within them. The heavens and earth are the images of *Qian* (Heaven) and *Kun* (Earth). \"Establishing positions\" refers to arranging the positions of yin and yang in mutual pairing. The *Yi* refers to *Kan* (Water) and *Li* (Fire). *Kan* and *Li* are the two functions of *Qian* and *Kun*. These two functions, without fixed line positions, circulate through the six voids, coming and going without fixed up or down, now hidden in obscurity, now concealed in concealment, transforming within and enveloping the myriad things as the guiding principles of the Dao.\n\nIn this passage, Master Wei explains that *Qian* and *Kun* serve as the divine chamber, arranging the positions of yin and yang in mutual pairing so that *Kan* and *Li* may interact within to achieve the work of transformation. The *Yi* refers to *Kan* and *Li*, which are the sun and moon as the *Yi*. The sun and moon are the *Yi* of heaven and earth, while *Kan* and *Li* are the *Yi* within the human body. *Qian* and *Kun* are its substance; *Kan* and *Li* are its function. These two functions, without fixed line positions, circulate through the six voids, coming and going without fixed up or down, now hidden in obscurity beyond measure, now concealed beyond trace, yet transforming within to generate the supreme treasure—just as the intercourse of yin and yang gives birth to the myriad things, serving as the guiding principles of the Dao.\n\nTo restrain the formless with the formed, the instrumental is empty, hence the saying: \"Push forth the waxing and waning, *Kan* and *Li* vanish.\" The *Jinbi Jing* (Scripture of the Golden and Azure) states: \"The formless and the formed restrain each other; the Vermilion Bird flames in emptiness, the purple radiance shines, cinnabar and mercury vanish.\" Master Wei’s words elucidate the precautions of the *Jinbi Jing*: it is to use the fire of inherent nature and true emptiness to restrain the supreme treasure of the water of life. The body of fire is fundamentally empty; when it encounters things, it manifests. That which is luminously empty and selfless is the virtue of fire. When fire is activated within the cauldron of the great void, the purple flames fill the heavens, the red light pervades the golden palace and jade towers, myriad transformations appear, divine beasts and dragons soar in countless forms—this is lead and mercury, this is *Kan* and *Li*. Yet though it is not nothing, once the work is accomplished, where does it reside? Hence it is said: \"Push forth the waxing and waning, *Kan* and *Li* vanish.\"\n\nWords are not idly fabricated; theories are not baselessly generated. They are drawn from verified effects, measured by divine illumination, and grounded in the principles of the structured characters. *Kan* corresponds to the lunar essence *wu*, *Li* to the solar radiance *ji*. The sun and moon are the *Yi*; hardness and softness correspond. Earth flourishes in the four seasons, weaving through beginning and end. Green, red, white, and black each reside in their respective directions, all receiving the workings of the central palace’s *wu* and *ji*.\n\nThe method of the *Yi*’s hexagram-numerology assigns *Kan* to the six *wu* and *Li* to the six *ji*. *Kan* is the moon, *Li* is the sun; hence it is said: \"*Kan* is the lunar essence *wu*, *Li* is the solar radiance *ji*.\" The characters for \"sun\" and \"moon\" combine to form the character for *Yi*; thus it is said: \"Push forth the structured characters.\" All these are grounded in principle as evidence, not idly fabricated theories. Since the *Yi* does not extend beyond the sun and moon, how could the elixir not be rooted in *Kan* and *Li*? Yet *Kan* and *Li* both contain *wu* and *ji*. As the ancients said: \"It is because both harbor the true earth that the golden elixir can return and revert.\" Moreover, earth flourishes in the four seasons, weaving through beginning and end. Though water, fire, wood, and metal each reside in their respective directions, they all receive the virtue of earth from the central palace. As Zhang Ziyang’s poem says: \"The four images and five phases all rely on earth; the workings of earth’s virtue are great indeed!\" For earth is the mother of metal. Knowing that the five phases all return to earth, one knows that the five phases all transform into metal. Only then can one restrain creation within the central palace and plant the yellow sprout in the later earth.\n\nThe *Yi* is imagery; no imagery is more luminous than the sun and moon. Exhausting the spirit to know transformation: when yang advances, yin comes, converging like spokes in a wheel, revolving in alternation, emerging and entering, coiling and uncoiling. The *Jinbi Jing* says: \"No illumination in the elixir art is greater than metal and fire; exhausting the subtle to enact transformation: when yang moves, yin dissolves.\" Master Wei correlates this with the *Appended Judgments* of the *Yi*. The great Dao of the *Yi* manifests its imagery in the sun and moon; the great Dao of the elixir illuminates its workings in metal and fire. Metal and fire are *Kan* and *Li*. Thus, when the essence of metal flourishes, the Jade Hare’s brilliance increases; when the virtue of fire is abundant, the Golden Crow’s intensity doubles. Once the scholar has exhausted the spirit to know transformation, making yang advance and yin come, converging like spokes in a wheel, revolving in alternation, emerging and entering, mutually coiling and uncoiling, taking the line images of the *Yi* as nodal markers and observing the sun and moon’s twilight and dawn to conduct the fire times, one naturally seizes the mechanism of heaven and earth and steals the marvels of creation.\n\nThe *Yi* has three hundred and eighty-four lines; accordingly, one selects the markers. \"Markers\" refer to the sixty-four hexagrams. From darkness to dawn, when *Zhen* (Thunder) arrives to receive the marker—at this moment, heaven and earth unite their essence, the sun and moon mutually sustain, the male yang spreads forth its purple radiance, the female yin transforms into the yellow womb. In the chaotic intercourse, the root is established, the foundation laid. Cultivating and nourishing the bud, the spirit congeals to form the body. All beings, from the great to the minute, from the creeping to the moving, none do not emerge from this.\n\nThe *Yi* has three hundred and eighty-four lines; the medicine has three hundred and eighty-four *zhu*. Twenty-four *zhu* make one *liang*; three hundred and eighty-four *zhu* make sixteen *liang*, which is the tally of the two eights. The principle of yin and yang’s ascent and descent is to select the hexagrams as markers and observe the markers to conduct the fire. The markers are the line images; there are no separate markers. In the language of the *Yi*, they are called hexagrams; in the language of the elixir, they are called markers. Hence it is said: \"Markers refer to the sixty-four hexagrams.\"\n\nWhen the hexagram corresponds to *Zhen*, the birth of yang, the fire advances with the marker of one yang. At this time, the divine chamber refines its essence, metal and fire interact, pushing forth the male yang dragon and the female yin tiger. \"Spreading forth the purple radiance\" refers to the dragon ascending the purple heavens to descend as rain. \"Transforming into the yellow womb\" refers to the tiger entering the later earth to produce metal. This is the imagery of ascending to heaven and entering earth, their chaotic intercourse. Thereupon, the root is established, the foundation laid; cultivating and nourishing the bud, the spirit congeals to form the body. From the great—heaven and earth—to the minute—creeping things—all that have form and qi emerge from this. Only by producing this one womb externally does one descend from the root to the branches, becoming the Dao of endless generation. Only by producing this one womb internally does one return to the root and revert to the source, attaining the Dao of long life and transcendence.\n\nThus, when Confucius praised the *Hong Meng* (Vast Obscurity), he extolled the virtue of *Qian* and *Kun* penetrating emptiness. When the ancient sages investigated the primordial, at the beginning of the *Guanju* (Osprey) chapter, the marriage of *qi* was first established, and the year’s first sprout flourished. Before form and *qi* were complete, it was called *Hong Meng*; once complete but not yet separated, it was called *Hun Lun* (Chaos). The *Yi* says: \"The *Yi* has the Supreme Ultimate, which generates the Two Modes.\" The *Yi* is like *Hong Meng*; the Supreme Ultimate is like *Hun Lun*. *Qian* and *Kun* are the transformations of the Supreme Ultimate. Combined, they are the Supreme Ultimate; divided, they are *Qian* and *Kun*. Thus, speaking of *Qian* and *Kun* combined is called *Hun Lun*; speaking of *Qian* and *Kun* divided is called heaven and earth. Confucius praised the *Yi* by first presenting *Qian* and *Kun* as the gateways of the *Yi*, for the virtue of *Qian* and *Kun* penetrating emptiness contains the *Yi* of *Hong Meng*.",

Abandon yin and cultivate yang, and yin will naturally perish. When yin is exhausted and yang is pure, one naturally becomes true.",

      "translated_text": "The *Guan Ju* poem embodies the principle of marriage, taking the intertwining of the Two *qi* as its meaning. Before *Qian* and *Kun* divided, it was called *Hun Lun*; when yin and yang intertwined, it was called the beginning. *Liezi* says: \"The *Tai Chu* is the beginning of *qi*; the *Tai Shi* is the beginning of form.\" Thus, it is said that *Guan Ju* establishes the beginning.\n\nThe Golden Elixir is the Supreme Unity, the Primordial Lord, who takes the *qi* of *Qian* and *Kun* before division, yin and yang before separation, and transforms it into true mercury, refining it into true cinnabar. Hence, it is called the \"primordial unity of *qi*, the supreme essence of the undifferentiated.\" It is also said: \"There is a thing formed in chaos, born before heaven and earth.\" The *Jin Bi Jing* states: \"The Primordial Lord first refines mercury; the divine chamber contains the cavernous void. Mysterious whiteness gives birth to the Golden Duke, majestically establishing the beginning.\" Its defense lies here. The \"first year\" is the inaugural year, the initial stage of cultivation. In the first year, the yellow sprout flourishes, and the Golden Elixir is achieved.\n\nScholars must observe the seasons and conditions, apply effort to gather the supreme treasure, and thus congeal the Elixir’s head. Once the Elixir’s head is obtained, one naturally guards the celestial mechanism in silence and stands upon the transcendent sage’s ground. Worldly people, deluded and ignorant of the celestial mechanism, recklessly measure with private intentions, either misrecognizing deviant paths or mistakenly seeking external objects. How could they know that the divine, numinous treasure arises from emptiness and nothingness? For before *Qian* and *Kun* divided and yin and yang separated, there was already its time.\n\nThose who study the Dao must be utterly sincere, wholeheartedly turning toward the true Dao. Once they encounter a master who transmits the oral instructions—or thoroughly read this book and suddenly awaken—they will naturally comprehend its timing. Having grasped the timing, they can then gather the supreme treasure from emptiness and obtain the numinous thing from the indistinct. Someone may ask: \"How can there be anything within emptiness and the indistinct?\" The answer is: \"Have you not seen the burning mirror drawing fire and the water-mirror gathering moisture? Their fire and water arise from emptiness. It is only that people do not know that within emptiness itself, there are natural, divine, and wondrous functions—unseen, unheard, and untouchable.\"\n\nThe sage does not arise in vain; he observes and manifests the celestial signs. The celestial signs have advance and retreat, contraction and extension, responding to the seasons. Thus, the *Yi* governs the heart of heaven. The \"manifest celestial signs\" are the sun and moon. The sun and moon have advance and retreat, contraction and extension, corresponding to the *Yi*’s hexagrams, the ascent and descent of yin and yang, and the cyclical alternation of coming and going. Thus, we know the *Yi* governs the heart of heaven, and the sage composes the *Yi*—how could he have arisen in vain?\n\nThe *Fu* hexagram establishes the beginning, sprouting and growing. The son inherits the father’s body and founds his foundation upon the mother. The waxing and waning respond to the pitch pipes; the ascent and descent rely on the pivot of the Dipper. For three days, it emerges as dawn; *Zhen* receives *geng* in the west on the eighth day; *Dui* receives *ding* above, level as a taut cord. On the fifteenth day, *Qian*’s body reaches fullness in the east, where the toad and hare’s essences—sun and moon—shine with dual brightness. The toad observes the hexagram’s nodes; the hare emits its radiance. After the eight upper paths are completed, it bends and descends. On the sixteenth day, it turns to receive governance; *Xun* meets *xin* at dawn’s clarity. *Gen* stands upright within, then descends south on the twenty-third day. *Kun* receives *yi* on the thirtieth day in the northeast, losing its companion. When the nodes are exhausted, they alternate and succeed one another, and the dragon’s body is reborn.\n\nThe Great Dao is manifest in creation, yet creation is most difficult to fathom. If one can fathom creation and discern its mechanism, then one can probe the Dao’s wonders and steal its use. Who but true immortals and supreme sages could achieve this?",

      "translated_text": "The ancient sagely perfected ones, benevolent toward the heart-mind of all under heaven, were beyond comprehension. Having fathomed the mechanism of creation to benefit themselves, they further illuminated its wonders to benefit others. What lies within oneself can indeed be known through mind and guarded by intention, yet to reveal it to others—without borrowing images or relying on texts—how could one make it manifest so that others might silently grasp it? Thus, they looked up and down between heaven and earth, and nothing displayed the wondrous workings of creation more clearly than the sun and moon. They searched through the classics, and nothing recorded the subtle principles of creation more profoundly than the *Yi*’s hexagrams. Comparing the sun and moon’s waxing and waning with the *Yi*’s changing lines and moving principles, they found perfect correspondence. This is the origin of the *Cantong Qi* (\"The Seal of the Unity of the Three\"). It is said to unite the principles of the *Great Yi*, the wonders of creation, and the Dao of the Great Elixir.\n\nNow observe: when the first yang arises, its hexagram is *Fu* (Return). *Zhen* (Thunder) below and *Kun* (Earth) above, *Zhen* is the eldest son, *Kun* the mother, and *Qian* (Heaven) the father. The *Fu* hexagram is originally pure *Kun*, with one yang emerging from *Qian* to transform the lower into *Zhen*. Thus, it is said, \"By the mother, the foundation is established.\" *Zhen* contains the body of *Qian* in subtle form; gradually accumulating, two yangs become three, and the body of *Qian* is complete. Hence, it is said, \"The eldest son inherits the father’s body.\" The waxing and waning correspond to the twelve pitch pipes: each month, one line is added. According to the *Big Dipper’s Pivot*, each hour, one *qi* advances. On the third day of the month, the moon appears faintly in the west at the *geng* position, corresponding to *Zhen*’s first yang arising. The *Zhouyi*’s \"Receiving the Stem\" method assigns *Zhen* to the six *geng*s. The principles of creation align thus. On the eighth day, the moon appears fully illuminated in the south at the *ding* position, corresponding to *Dui* (Lake), where two yangs arise and the *ding* method assigns *Dui* to the six *ding*s. By the fifteenth day, the moon is full in the east at the *jia* position, and the *Qian* hexagram receives the six *jia*s. At this time, the hexagram embodies three yangs, and both hare and toad are at their peak. The toad, essence of metal *qi*, observes the hexagram’s nodes and gradually waxes. The jade hare, spirit of *mao* wood, faces the great yang and emits its light. Seven and eight make fifteen; the Way of three and five is complete. Then, the full wanes, the extended bends, the high descends, and the ascending lowers. On the sixteenth day, one yin arises, and yin begins its governance. The moon appears at dawn in the west at the *xin* position, corresponding to *Xun* (Wind), which receives *xin*. By the twenty-third day, the moon appears at dawn in the south at the *bing* position, corresponding to *Gen* (Mountain), which receives *bing*. By the thirtieth day, the moon vanishes in the east at the *yi* position, corresponding to *Kun*, which receives *yi*. When the nodes are exhausted, they alternate, and yang resumes its governance, the dragon’s body reborn. The dragon is *Zhen*.\n\nAmong the eight hexagrams, only *Kan* (Water) and *Li* (Fire) do not participate directly, yet their functions rise and descend within the six hexagrams. The workings of *Kan* and *Li* are vast indeed! *Ren* and *gui* pair with *jia* and *yi*; *Qian* and *Kun* encompass the beginning and end. Seven and eight make fifteen; nine and six also correspond. The four together make thirty, when the yang *qi* withdraws and hides. The eight hexagrams are arrayed, the luminaries move, yet the center is never lost. *Qian* receives the six *jia*s and six *ren*s; *Kun* receives the six *yi*s and six *gui*s. Among the eight hexagrams, only *Qian* and *Kun* receive two stems; the rest receive one. Thus, it is said, \"*Ren* and *gui* pair with *jia* and *yi*; *Qian* and *Kun* encompass the beginning and end,\" revealing that within *Qian* and *Kun* lies true water. The lesser yang is seven, the lesser yin eight; together they make fifteen. The greater yang is nine, the greater yin six; together they make fifteen. The four combined make thirty, corresponding to the days of a month. Seven, eight, nine, and six are the Four Images. The principles of the *Great Yi* and creation are perfectly aligned.\n\nWhen the moon vanishes on the thirtieth day, the yang *qi* withdraws and hides. Beyond this, one yang arises anew. Revolving in cycles, ending and beginning again, moving without losing the center—this accords with creation without error and aligns with the hexagrams’ lines without deviation.\n\nThe primordial essence is subtle and difficult to perceive; by inference, verification, and evidence, one observes its images, models its forms, establishes standards, and sets norms. By divination, one determines fortune or misfortune, issues commands, and follows the seasons without fail. When lines move, one examines the *Hetu* above and orders the earth’s veins below, investigating the human heart-mind and integrating the Three Powers. In movement, one follows the hexagram’s nodes; in stillness, one relies on the *tuan*’s words. *Qian* and *Kun* are applied to act—how could the principles not be harmonious?\n\nThe primordial essence is the most numinous and divine treasure, born of emptiness and formlessness, dwelling in the subtle and indistinct, without trace or track. To gather it, one must thoroughly understand yin and yang, deeply penetrate creation, infer its correspondences, and verify its methods. In stillness, observe its images and model its forms; in movement, establish standards to divine fortune or misfortune. Above, examine the celestial patterns; below, observe the tides; within, investigate the human heart-mind. Further, follow the hexagram’s nodes: when yang acts, do not lose the line’s changing images; when yin is still, embody the utmost softness and contain light. Thus, the workings of *Qian* and *Kun* lie within oneself, and the numinous essence of spirit can be gathered. Moreover, when the eight winds harmonize, sweet dew descends; when yin and yang are balanced, sweet springs arise—these are the signs of heaven and earth in order. Harmony brings auspiciousness; discord brings calamity. How can one not be vigilant?\n\nThe first task of governance is to manage the subtle and secret, to open and spread the precious, to grasp the essential Dao, and to hold the handle that unifies transformation. When lines move within, fortune or misfortune arises without. The five planets move in harmony or disorder, responding to the seasons. When the four and seven are discordant, separation and opposition occur in all directions.\n\nAt the outset of cultivation, as at the beginning of governance, one must restrain and eliminate evil and excess, cast out desires, and manage the primordial *qi* to make it subtle, secret, and firm, without fear of leakage. Naturally, the treasure will spread in the golden womb, and spirit will be born in the jade chamber. If even a hair’s breadth is amiss, it is like governance gone awry, responding to the seasons with celestial anomalies. The key lies in regulating the fire and awaiting the precise moment, embodying the Big Dipper’s revolution. When lines move within, fortune or misfortune arises without, and the five planets may err or the constellations follow discord.\n\n*Wenchang* oversees and interrogates; the *Taifu* and hundred officials each govern their departments. The elixir resides in the spirit chamber, just as a ruler establishes a state. The ruler’s establishment of a state is modeled on celestial patterns: there are the Three Terraces and the positions of the ducal assistants, and the office of *Wenchang* that oversees and records. The duty of the ducal assistants is to sit and discourse on the Dao, harmonizing yin and yang, ensuring each official fulfills their role—hence, interrogation lies with the ducal assistants. The office of oversight measures talent, promotes the worthy, and demotes the unworthy, ensuring each official performs their duty—hence, oversight lies with *Wenchang*. When the hundred officials each fulfill their roles, the people and things are at peace, and all under heaven is harmonious. When the fire signs of the hexagrams do not lose their measure, the myriad transformations flow smoothly, and the sacred embryo grows. Yet governing a state depends on the summons of one person; refining the elixir depends on the resonance of one heart-mind.",

When the nodes are exhausted, they alternate and succeed one another, and the dragon’s body is reborn.\n\nThe Great Dao is manifest in creation, yet creation is most difficult to fathom. If one can fathom creation and discern its mechanism, then one can probe the Dao’s wonders and steal its use. Who but true immortals and supreme sages could achieve this?",

      "translated_text": "The sun aligns with the essence of the Five Phases, and the moon receives the rhythm of the Six Pitches. Five and six make thirty degrees; when the degrees are complete, they begin anew. This is the origin and end, the thread of existence and decay. If the ruler is arrogant and excessive, overbearing and full, he violates the Dao. If the minister is treacherous and sycophantic, his conduct does not follow the proper path. When the waxing and waning of weights and measures deviate, misfortune and calamity arise. The enforcers of the law admonish and interrogate, reproaching the ruler for his faults.\n\nThis passage on five and six clarifies the function of water and earth. The number of earth is five, and the number of the sun is also five, for the number of the Five Phases is five. The number of water is six, and the number of the moon is also six, for the number of the Six Pitches is six. From *jia* to *gui* are the ten celestial stems, comprising five yang and five yin—this is the number five of the sun. The twelve lunar pitches comprise six *lü* and six *lü’*—this is the number six of the moon. Five and six make thirty degrees; when the degrees are complete, they begin anew—this is the cyclical recurrence of the dark and new moons. The two substances, metal and fire, alternately exist and decay between the dark and new moons. When the ruler is arrogant and excessive, overbearing and full, violating the Dao, it is because the weight of earth is excessive and its balance is awry. When the minister is treacherous and sycophantic, his conduct does not follow the proper path, it is because the weight of water is unstable. When weights and measures wax and wane, misfortune and calamity arise from deviation. The fault does not lie with fire but with earth. As the *Jinbi Jing* states: \"It is not the fault of fire; the blame is placed on earth.\" This is what it means.\n\nThe Northern Asterism receives the correct alignment, moving leisurely and entrusting matters to its subordinates. The Hall of Light enacts governance, and the state suffers no harm to the Dao. Internally, one nurtures oneself with tranquility, emptiness, and non-being, returning to the origin and illuminating within. The body is sealed, its openings fortified, and the three luminaries sink into obscurity. The child-pearl is tempered; though unseen, it is near and easily sought.\n\nThe cinnabar resides in the divine chamber as the Northern Asterism stands above, aligning the multitude of stars. The ruler enacts governance to oversee the myriad states. When centered and unmoving, the celestial array obeys in reverence. When one governs with folded arms and non-action, all under heaven is at peace. Thus, governing the state follows heaven, and the method of the elixir follows governance. One must conceal one’s brilliance, turn the light inward, and abide in non-action and silence, rooting deeply. The sun, moon, and myriad phenomena all sink together, their radiance concealed. The infant and the mysterious pearl grow, fundamentally tempered without deficiency. Within non-action, divine efficacy is revealed—not through form, but within formlessness. Though unseen and unheard, it is near and easily sought. It is not obtained from without but depends on the practitioner’s hidden merits and virtuous conduct.\n\nThe Yellow Center gradually permeates, its principle moistening and nourishing the skin. When the beginning is correct, the end will be cultivated, and the foundation will be established. One cannot rely on the yellow alone. Yellow is the color of the Central Palace, and cinnabar is the treasure of the Central Palace. The *Book of Changes*, in the *Wenyan* commentary on the sixth five of the *Kun* hexagram, states: \"The noble one is yellow and centered, penetrating in principle. He occupies the correct position and embodies the body, his beauty residing within. It flows through the four limbs and manifests in his undertakings—this is the height of beauty.\" How much more so when the body contains the great elixir and harbors the supreme treasure? Then his spirit and essence will be extraordinary, and his skin will be moist and lustrous—this is self-evident. Generally, to become an immortal, one must first become a noble person. If one’s virtue and conduct fall short of a noble person, one’s human Dao is still incomplete—how much more so the Dao of immortality? Thus, Master Wei drew from the *Book of Changes* the phrases \"residing in the center\" and \"treading the correct path\" to elucidate the principle of inner possession and outer manifestation. When those of superior capacity hear this, they accumulate merit and amass virtue to ascend as immortals. When those of middling capacity hear this, they at least do not fail to become good people and noble persons.\n\nThe One serves to conceal; the world does not know it. As the scripture states: \"When you comprehend the One, all matters are complete.\" Yet how easily can the wondrous principle of the One be known? Only after knowing this One can one attain this One. This One is the true One, the One of the One—it is not the numerical One. The true One, the One of the One, is born of the Dao, whereas the numerical One is the \"Heaven engenders water\" One. Knowing that the One is born of the Dao, the Dao of the great elixir is entirely encompassed. Thus, it is said: \"The One serves to conceal,\" but the world does not know it.\n\nSupreme virtue is non-action, not seeking through scrutiny. Inferior virtue acts, its function unceasing. When the upper is closed, it is called \"having\"; when the lower is closed, it is called \"non-being.\" \"Non-being\" serves the upper. Above, the spirit-virtue resides in these two apertures, modeling the qi of metal, which also mutually responds.\n\nThe Dao of heaven descends and shines; the Dao of earth ascends and is humble and dark. The Dao of *Kun* ascends, and its body is fundamentally still. Stillness is non-action, which cannot be sought through scrutiny. The Dao of *Qian* descends, and its body is perpetually in motion. Motion is action, ceaselessly striving. When the upper is closed, it is called \"having\"—the Dao of *Kun* ascends, and when closed, it has water, which has form. When the lower is closed, it is called \"non-being\"—the Dao of *Qian* descends, and when closed, it has fire, which leaves no trace. \"Non-being\" serves the upper—*Qian* can seek *Kun* and cause it to ascend. Above, the spirit-virtue resides—*Kun* contains the treasure of the true One. *Qian* descends and can generate the qi of *Kun*; *Kun* ascends and can generate the metal of *Qian*. The essential point lies in the two apertures of *Qian* and *Kun* mutually employing each other. When above and below interact harmoniously, metal abounds, and qi naturally arises. When qi abounds, metal naturally flourishes. Thus, metal and qi truly depend on each other—this is the wondrous function of *Qian* and *Kun*.\n\nTo know the white and guard the black is to invite the advent of spirit illumination. White is the essence of metal; black is the foundation of water. Water is the pivot of the Dao, its number named One, the beginning of yin and yang. It contains the yellow sprout and is the master of the five metals. The Northern River Cart, thus, is lead—externally black, internally harboring golden radiance. It wears coarse cloth yet holds jade within, appearing as a madman.\n\nWhite is silver; black is lead. To know the white and guard the black means to refine silver within lead. Refining silver within lead, spirit illumination naturally arises. Yin is the essence of metal; lead is the foundation of water. Among the Five Phases, only water’s number is One, aligning with the pivot of the Dao and serving as the beginning of yin and yang. Though not the true One of the One, it fulfills the function of the true One. Thus, the Dao of the true One first takes the golden child as the root of the yellow sprout. The golden child is water. To unite the myriad distinctions into One, one must first seek the One within the myriad distinctions as the foundation. This is the principle behind the method of the golden elixir employing lead. Thus, water is called the pivot of the Dao.\n\nDiscussing this, one clarifies that water attains the function of the true One but is not the true One itself. Water’s generating number is One; water’s completing number is six. Speaking in terms of the completing number six, water One contains earth Five. Thus, lead is externally black and internally contains golden radiance, possessing the wondrous function of containing the yellow sprout. Water is the beginning of the Five Phases; lead is the master of the five metals. Water originally resides in the north, but when transported southward, it ascends from below, carrying the treasure upward like a river cart. Thus, it is called the River Cart. Mixed with yellow, it wears coarse cloth—lead’s substance is inherently base.",

      "translated_text": "Within lies white silver, hence it is called \"embracing jade\"—guarding the supreme treasure in concealment. Generally, the principles of creation and transformation all employ the base to guard the noble, the obscure to nurture the luminous, the lowly to preserve the exalted, and the mad to cultivate the sage. Though outwardly appearing as a madman, within he harbors the supreme treasure. Thus, the subtle mechanism remains sealed, and the shrewd merchant deeply conceals his goods—how can those who hastily seek others' recognition be spoken of in the same breath?\n\nMaster Wei’s method fundamentally resides in lead, yet its significance extends to both. Gold is the mother of water, the mother gestating the child’s embryo; water is the child of gold, the child concealing the mother’s womb. The true person’s wonder lies in being as if present, as if absent, resembling the great abyss—now sinking, now floating, advancing and retreating, each guarding its own domain. Silver is gold, lead is water; gold is water, hence gold is the mother of water. Water is the child of gold; lead conceals silver, hence the mother gestates the child’s embryo, the child conceals the mother’s womb. The golden embryo resides within lead, just as the true person dwells within the abyss—sometimes visible, sometimes hidden, now sinking, now floating. When lead is employed and water retreats, the abyss clears, and the true person emerges, each then guarding its own domain. The *Jinbi Jing* states: \"In the ash pool, flames scorch; lead sinks, silver floats\"—its principle is the same.\n\nGathering the white, refining it into vermilion, the exterior guards while the true resides within, square and round, a inch in diameter, intermingled yet mutually constrained—born before heaven and earth, majestic and supremely exalted. \"Gathering the white\" means collecting the floating silver, the supreme treasure of the west; \"refining it into vermilion\" means congealing the golden elixir, the sacred embryo in the southern chamber. When the elixir is formed, its manifestation resembles the primordial chaos of the cosmic egg, the true within the white, square and round, a inch in diameter, intermingled yet mutually constrained—this is Master Wei’s revelation of the precelestial symbolic method. Since it was born before heaven and earth, its majesty and exaltation are beyond contemplation.\n\nSurrounding it are ramparts and gates, resembling Penglai, encircling and enclosing, with four passages secured. Hesitating and guarding, the defense is firm and impenetrable, blocking all wickedness. Curved galleries connect, ever vigilant against the unforeseen—thus, one need not ponder calamities nor weary the spirit with anxieties. When the chamber is filled with *qi*, none can retain it. Those who guard it prosper; those who lose it perish. In movement and stillness, rest and activity, it constantly accompanies the practitioner.\n\nWithin the divine chamber, the symbolic form is complete, and the world is established. The golden wheel encircles it like ramparts, enclosing the world within, akin to the beauty of Penglai. The firmness of silver mountains and iron walls blocks all wickedness, ensuring no unforeseen threats. The four passages of jade towers and jasper pavilions allow for unobstructed spiritual play. At this time, one need not ponder calamities nor weary the spirit with anxieties, preserving great harmony as if holding a full vessel. A single thought’s movement or stillness, and the Dharma-body follows. When *qi* fills the body, it is most difficult to preserve. Guarding it brings prosperity; losing it brings ruin. Scholars, take heed!\n\nThese are not methods from the esoteric scriptures. Those who inwardly visualize with closed eyes, pondering the essence of the five viscera; who tread the Dipper and pace the celestial stems, invoking the Six Jia spirits by day and the Yin paths by night; who suppress the Nine Ones to disrupt primordial chaos; who consume *qi* through the primordial womb, causing the intestines to gurgle; who exhale the upright and inhale external evil; who remain sleepless day and night, ceaseless even at the new and full moons—such practitioners exhaust their bodies daily, their spirits weary and minds befuddled, appearing as if deranged. Their hundred vessels boil like cauldrons, never attaining clarity. Dwelling in earthen huts, erecting altars, they worship and sacrifice morning and evening, offering ritual objects, perceiving forms and images, their dreams filled with stirring emotions. Rejoicing and delighting, they believe their lives will surely be prolonged, only to die suddenly by heaven’s decree, their corpses exposed, their actions often perverse and contrary, losing the pivotal mechanism. Such arts are myriad—thousands of methods, tens of thousands of variations—all deviating from the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, twisting and contorting to the Nine Capitals.\n\nThe world’s arts and techniques are innumerable. Though the esoteric scriptures contain many methods, scholars must discern the true from the false, carefully examining right and wrong. Those who close their eyes to inwardly visualize the essence of the five viscera, tread the Dipper to draw the upright *qi* of the celestial stems, invoke the Six Jia by day and perform Yin rites by night, suppress the Nine Ones to practice Yin paths, exhale the upright *qi* and inhale turbid evil, consume *qi* through the primordial womb, remain sleepless day and night, ceaseless even at the new and full moons—such practitioners exhaust their bodies daily, their spirits weary and minds befuddled. Some erect altars to sacrifice to spirits; others seek divine favor through dreams. Though such arts are many, none are orthodox methods. Aspiring to longevity, they instead meet early death, their corpses rotting, their lives wasted—truly lamentable. How could they know that the golden liquid returning elixir transforms the fleshly body of parents, enabling flight and ascension? As described above, all such methods violate the Dao of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, their actions instead incurring wrath in the Nine Capitals’ courts.\n\nThe enlightened reflect on these principles, understanding the path to vastness. Diligently practicing day and night without rest, consuming the elixir for three years, they become light and ascend, traversing fire without burning, entering water without wetting. They can appear or vanish, ever joyful and free from care. When the Dao is accomplished and virtue perfected, they conceal themselves to await the time when the Great One summons them, relocating to the Central Land. When their merit is complete, they ascend, receiving the register and chart.\n\nThose in the world who understand this Dao reflect on Master Wei’s principles, knowing the path of cultivation. Diligently practicing day and night without ceasing, in less than three years, the elixir is accomplished. They can then emerge from water and enter fire, ascend lightly and travel afar, transforming with spiritual efficacy, carefree and at ease. Yet when the Dao is accomplished and virtue perfected, they must conceal themselves among people, accumulating merit and deeds, awaiting the summons of the Great One, the Primordial Lady. Then they relocate to the Central Land, receive the chart and register, and when their merit is complete, ascend, their bodies returning to the Purple Palace. This is what is meant by \"accumulating three thousand merits to become an immortal of the Great Luo\" and \"completing eight hundred merits to become a guest of the Great Luo.\" It all depends on the level of merit and deeds.\n\nThe *Fire Record* is not falsely composed; it elucidates the *Yi* to clarify it. The crescent-moon crucible, the White Tiger without scorching, the pivot of mercury—when the sun becomes the flowing pearl, the Green Dragon rises with it. East unites with west, the hun and po naturally constrain each other. Above, the trigram *Dui* numbers eight; below, the trigram *Gen* also numbers eight. The two eights unite their essence, and the body of *Qian* and *Kun* is formed. Two eights make one catty, the upright Dao uninclined. A catty has three hundred eighty-four *zhu*, corresponding to the number of hexagrams and lines. Ancient elixir texts describe the fire phases and their functions, calling them the *Fire Record*—six hundred chapters in all, yet their principles do not exceed the *Zhou Yi*. How could the *Fire Record* be composed without basis? It should be elucidated through the *Yi*.\n\nThe *Yi* has three hundred eighty-four lines, corresponding to the fire phases of the celestial cycle. The upper and lower eights make one catty; one catty records three hundred eighty-four *zhu*, perfectly matching the hexagrams and lines. The *Qian* lines number one hundred ninety-two; the *Kun* lines number one hundred ninety-two—thus, the Dao of *Qian* and *Kun* is complete.

      "translated_text": "This aperture is half white and half black, resembling a crescent moon—hence it is called the Crescent-Moon Crucible. To know the Crescent Moon as the crucible and cauldron is to comprehend more than half of the Great Elixir’s Dao.\n\nThe White Tiger lies below as the pivot of fire’s ignition; the Azure Dragon resides above, stirring the winds and waves of ascent. Within them, true mercury transforms and flows as pearls. Thus, the Eastern Dragon and Western Tiger intertwine, yin essence and yang spirit restrain each other, divine workings circulate within the golden tripod, and sacred medicine is forged in the jade crucible. The mechanism of creation is inverted, the functions of *Qian* and *Kun* are reversed—who but the most profoundly penetrating in the world could achieve this?\n\nWhen gold enters fierce fire, its color remains unaltered, and its radiance naturally emerges. Since the beginning of creation, the sun and moon have never waned in brightness; gold has never lost its weight. The sun and moon retain their constant forms, for gold is born from the moon. At the new moon, it receives the sun’s essence; when gold returns to its mother, the moon wanes, and they envelop each other, concealing their boundaries and sinking into the cavernous void. Gold regains its original nature, and its majestic radiance fills the crucible.\n\nThe sun, moon, and gold endure the longest. Since the opening of heaven and earth, the forms of the sun and moon have remained constant, never dimming in brightness; the weight of true gold has remained unchanged, never losing its luster. These three are of one body. People merely observe that when gold’s essence flourishes, the moon’s brightness doubles, knowing that gold is born from the moon—but they do not realize that the moon’s brightness originally arises from the sun. Thus, at the moment of their convergence, the moon conceals its light, sinking into the cavernous void to receive the sun’s transformation, thereby generating gold. Gold’s nature fundamentally derives from the sun, so its firmness, hardness, weight, and solidity bear the sun’s color and possess the sun’s nature. All things meet fire and none do not melt away—only gold, when placed in fire, does not lose its color. Refined a hundred times, it grows ever harder; tempered in great smelting, it becomes ever redder. Fire is the qi of the Great Yang; gold is the essence of the Great Yin. When gold enters fierce fire, it regains its original nature—thus, when the crucible’s fire blazes, gold’s color intensifies, and its majestic radiance becomes delightfully resplendent.\n\nThe *zi* and *wu* numbers combine to make three; the *wu* and *ji* numbers are called five. When three and five harmonize, the Eight Stones serve as the guiding principle. Breathing nurtures and embraces; contemplation unites them as husband and wife. Yellow earth is the father of metal; flowing pearls are the mother of water. Water relies on earth as its dam; earth restrains water from rising. The Vermilion Bird is the essence of fire, balancing victory and defeat. When water prevails, fire is extinguished; when both perish, they return to the fertile earth. The three natures, once united, share a common origin.\n\nThe Eight Stones are external medicine, exemplified by the three and five. The *zi* (water) is one; the *wu* (fire) is two. The numbers of *zi* and *wu* combine to form three. Earth’s number is five, hence *wu* and *ji* are called five. When three and five harmonize, water, fire, and earth unite. These three serve as husband and wife, alternately as ruler and minister, just as the Eight Stones mutually regulate. Earth generates metal, so earth is the father of metal; earth restrains water, so earth is the dam of water. Flowing pearls are mercury, born from the sun and congealed into metal. Metal generates water, so flowing pearls are the mother of water. Watering it extinguishes fire’s flames; damming it with earth prevents water’s overflow. Thus, the three substances form one family, all returning to *wu* and *ji*. When water meets earth, it dissipates; when fire meets earth, it subsides; when metal meets earth, it returns to its father. Earth is the father of metal, so fire is the ancestor of metal—hence, when the three natures unite, their original nature shares a common ancestor.\n\nSesame is also called *jusheng* (great victory), an ordinary herb—consuming it can still prolong life. How much more so the divine elixir, which is the essence of pure yang? Its nature is like unbreakable vajra, and gold is the most precious treasure among all things. If one obtains and consumes it, longevity will be incomparably greater than with ordinary herbs.\n\nThe four directions—*chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei*—all contain earth, showing that metal, wood, water, and fire all rely on earth to stand. Though the five viscera correspond to metal, wood, water, and fire, they ultimately depend on earth to flourish. Metal is the child of earth; when true elixir enters the abdomen and metal’s qi penetrates the five viscera, misty vapors pervade the body, steaming like the moment in smelting when fire blazes intensely and water is applied above, billowing like smoke and mist. At that time, the four limbs and hundred vessels brim with spring’s moisture, steaming and spreading naturally. The complexion is renewed, bones are transformed, old age returns to infancy, the countenance becomes radiant, the spirit joyful. White hair turns black, fallen teeth regrow in their original places, old men regain youth, and aged women become maidens. The form is altered, worldly calamities are escaped, clarity persists day and night, and consciousness remains awake. The dharma-body and illusory form are both fulfilled; yin essence and yang spirit are equally wondrous—only then can one be called a True Person.\n\nAt such a time, though mingling with the dust of the mundane, one is not of the Three Realms; though dwelling in the impure world, one’s conduct and concealment are unfathomable. If one wishes to depart, one directly ascends Penglai; if one desires to roam freely, one instantly transcends the realm of forms.\n\nWhen lead powder is cast into fire, its color is destroyed and returns to lead. Ice and snow, melted by warm water, dissolve into the Great Mystery. Gold takes cinnabar as its essence, harmonizing with mercury, transforming through its truth, beginning and ending in mutual dependence. To refine and consume the immortal elixir, one must use like substances—planting millet requires millet, hatching chicks requires their own eggs, and like substances naturally assist in completion. How can fish eyes become pearls? How can mugwort become sandalwood? Like substances follow each other; discordant matters do not form treasures. Thus, swallows do not bear phoenixes; foxes and rabbits do not nurse horses. Water does not flow upward; fire does not moisten downward.\n\nThings of like kind resonate without expectation, inevitably and without exception. Lead powder is originally lead; when burned and cast into fire again, its color is destroyed and returns to lead. Ice and snow are originally water; when warmed by fire’s qi, they return to water. The birth of the supreme treasure arises from the true essence of the Great Yang, gathering spirit and refining excellence. Initially forming cinnabar, within it already resides true mercury. When true mercury leaves its mother, it is called mercury. Mercury, in the great smelting, is refined by the Great Yang; over time, it congeals into silver. Silver, over time, transforms into gold—thus, gold fundamentally takes cinnabar as its essence. Cinnabar is spirit.",

      "translated_text": "Thus it is said: the divine cinnabar and mercury are essence. Hence, in the initial stages of refining the elixir, one first gathers the essence of Yang to transform it into cinnabar, then takes mercury to blend with the cinnabar, grinding and harmonizing the two substances. Through smelting, they are refined into gold. Only after gold is formed does one employ lead for nurturing. For true essence arises from transformation, born of the Great Yang, yet must unite with the Great Yin to generate life—only with true lead can it be fit for ingestion. True lead is born of the Great Yin, thus it is said: like substances resonate; gold, when united with true lead, is as a child returning to its mother. Through this mutual assistance, the refining process is easily accomplished. It is like planting millet to grow grain, or a hen brooding over eggs—of like kind they resonate, of like qi they depend upon one another. Should one remain ignorant of this and seek elsewhere, one will but labor in vain, squandering effort, just as sparrows cannot hatch phoenixes, foxes cannot nurse colts, water cannot steam things, nor fire moisten them.\n\nGrasping this principle, when cinnabar and mercury unite, spirit is born; when water and fire interact, steaming and moistening occur. Thus, fire resides below water yet achieves the work of rising flame; water resides above fire yet fulfills the virtue of descending moisture. If not for the utmost essence under heaven, who could attain this? Many scholars in the world, though learned and ingenious, possessing fine talents, meet no opportunity. They exhaust fire and waste wealth, relying on texts and following them blindly, fabricating methods without foundation, losing measure and control. They pound and treat ginger stone, chalcanthite, mica, alum, magnetite, sulfur, and burn cedar clay, mixing them with the Five Minerals and copper, using these as aids. Yet their natures differ, their kinds do not align—how could they ever unite as one? A thousand attempts lead to ten thousand failures. Seeking success, they instead become deluded; hoping for fortune, they never encounter the sagely way. Alone, the sage understands. From youth to white-haired age, they waver midway, abandoning the Dao to cling to delusion, straying from the correct path into error. Their vision narrow as a tube, their knowledge too limited to fathom what lies ahead.\n\nThe principle of the golden elixir surpasses creation, far beyond the reach of thought. Without encountering a perfected one, all measurement is futile. To employ external substances is even more reckless—clinging to the heterodox while forsaking the orthodox is no path for the worthy. Yet those who often study the Dao are unwilling to steadfastly seek teachers and friends, to endure hardship and diligently inquire. Some begin but do not persist; others waver midway, wasting years until old age, achieving nothing. All this stems from the error of those who, peering at the sky through a tube, remain self-satisfied.\n\nYet the sun and moon shine brightly, the heavens and earth vast; cold and heat come and go, morning and evening alternate—all embody the principle of the Great Dao’s cyclic return. Without encountering a perfected one, it is difficult to fathom. Scholars should first accumulate deeds and amass virtue to invoke such an encounter, never deceiving themselves, lest they reach this mountain of treasure only to return empty-handed.\n\nAs for the utmost sages, none surpass Fuxi, who first drew the Eight Trigrams, modeling them on heaven and earth. King Wen, the ancestor of emperors, structured their forms and composed the line statements; the Master, among the host of sages, crafted the Ten Wings to assist them. These three lords, heaven-endowed, arose in succession to govern their times. Though their steps varied in excellence, their merits and virtues did not differ. Their creations built upon one another, their measurements precise to the fraction. What has form is easy to contemplate; what lacks omen is difficult to ponder. Their works became models for the world, establishing the *Book of Poetry* and *Book of Documents*, though these lacked prior knowledge, relying instead on teachers to awaken. Bright as lifting the curtain, wide-eyed as ascending a high tower.\n\nMaster Wei, though endowed with exceptional natural talent, still relied on a teacher for awakening. Thus he sighed: the wondrous principle of the golden elixir, having neither form nor omen, is truly difficult to contemplate or measure. Though the Three Sages embedded this principle in the *Book of Changes*, and the Eight Trigrams encompass the subtle workings of creation, their images point to the marvels of form, their words reveal the portents of function. Measured against the *Cantong Qi*, they still adhere to worldly methods. Though the sages weighed fractions and crafted their works for scholars to explore the profound and infer the obscure, how could they guard secrets within their words, transcending images midway? If the *Cantong Qi* had not been composed, how could this obscurity be illuminated? Thus, Master Wei, following books that exhaust principle and fulfill nature, described the way of transcending the mundane to enter sageliness—like holding the left tally, like lifting the front curtain. This arose from the transmission of teacher and disciple, not from prior knowledge. Know then that though heavenly mechanisms are distant, every person has a share; though the Great Dao is profound, every generation finds its inheritor. Do not say that only those with innate immortal bones may aspire to it. Know rather that with but a willing heart, none is unattainable. Master Wei’s humble words, both before and after, reveal the true compassion of past immortals.\n\nThe *Fire Record of Six Hundred Chapters* pursues the same aim, though its texts differ. Its words are earnest, yet people do not ponder deeply to trace its source and flow, though the obscure and manifest originally dwell together. How could I, speaking for the worthy, dare to treat it lightly? Yet if I were to seal my lips and silence the Dao, I would incur blame; to inscribe my thoughts on bamboo and silk would risk leaking heavenly secrets. Hesitating, I sigh, looking up and down, weaving these considerations. Though the methods of refining have their rules, I cannot bear to reveal them all. Thus, I briefly outline their essentials, their branches and leaves appearing in scattered form.\n\nScholars of the world, seeing the alchemical classics’ discussions of purple writings, fire phases, and the progression of advancing and retreating, civil and martial functions—each with its beginning and end, rise and cessation—are rarely without doubt. Hence, many texts state there are six hundred chapters to encompass the functions of fire phases. Yet they do not know that though the words differ, the substance is one; though the uses vary, the essence is the same. Once one recognizes the reversal of morning *zhun* and evening *wei*, one understands the cyclical return of day *gou* and night *fu*—like the turning of the celestial sphere, like following wheel tracks. Though the words are earnest, they are but diligent admonitions. Thus, six hundred chapters encompass three hundred days, never departing from the two trigrams of advance and retreat. All lies in the sincerity of beginning and end, the single-mindedness of intent, precise to the finest thread.\n\nAlas! The sagely words are not obscure, yet the world does not ponder deeply. Thus, Master Wei composed three additional chapters, all embodying the same principle. He sought to clarify the essentials, expound the methods, and make the path easy for later learners to understand. How vast!\n\nUse gold as a dike, and water enters to flow freely. Gold accounts for fifteen, and water’s number is the same. When tending the furnace, fix the weights and measures: five parts water, with two parts surplus. These two are true gold, heavy as the original. The remaining three do not enter the fire but accompany them. The three substances mutually contain and receive, transforming as if by magic. Below, the qi of the Great Yang lies hidden, steaming. In an instant, it first liquefies, then congeals—this is called the Yellow Chariot. As months and years pass, it nears decay, harming longevity. The body becomes like dust in a bright window.\n\nTo refine the great elixir, first use pure gold to construct the city walls, encircling them completely. Then take true water and place it within, so that no seepage occurs. Some call it the golden dike, others the city walls—both express this idea.\n\nTo build the golden dike, merely understand the principle that the Four Images and Five Phases fully rely on earth, and gold will naturally form.",

Once these three coalesce and form the treasure, the soul and spirit naturally accompany them in wondrous union.\n\nWater enters the golden dike, originally a congealed liquid, steamed and refined by the hidden qi of the Great Yang below. Once the fire’s power is complete and the divine work fulfilled, it transforms into the Yellow Chariot, capable of myriad changes—whether as a dragon-drawn carriage or any other form. Upon shedding its embryo, the body shimmers like dust illuminated by sunlight through a bright window, revealing the accomplished transformations of Master Wei. Yet how can the world know? Those who recklessly speculate have never glimpsed even a dream of it, daring to voice their conjectures. Only those who have personally witnessed it can understand.\n\nIn the process of pounding, blending, and merging, enter the Crimson Gate, sealing its borders to ensure firmness. Ignite the blazing fire below, maintaining it day and night with unwavering diligence. Begin with the civil (wen) and conclude with the martial (wu), observing and adjusting with care. Monitor the cold and warmth, cycling through the twelve nodes, each completing its turn in mutual intimacy. When qi is nearly exhausted and life on the verge of cessation, the body approaches death—yet the hun and po transform, their hues shifting to a radiant purple, forming the Reverted Elixir. Powdered and measured with a ninefold knife’s edge, it is most divine.\n\nThis speaks of the work’s power, moving the bellows of heaven and earth. Pound and refine it until reaching the southern Crimson Gate, firmly sealing the boundary between water and fire. This labor continues day and night: first ascending with wen, then descending with wu, cycling through the twelve hours. As the day ends, they should grow ever closer. When qi is nearly spent and life hangs by a thread, the hundred vessels return to their root, and the myriad orifices fall silent—not death, yet akin to it. After this cessation, revival occurs: the golden light turns purple, resembling purple powder, a mere knife’s edge in quantity, manifesting everywhere in unfathomable transformations of divine wonder.\n\nExpounding the numbers of the Five Phases, the method is concise yet not cumbersome: use water to stimulate fire, and its light is suddenly extinguished. Yet the sun and moon, too, are water and fire. At each conjunction, they do not harm one another—why? Because the mutual consumption of heaven and earth’s yin and yang follows a fixed pattern, a set rhythm. There is no harm in water’s dominance or fire’s decline. Those who perceive this mechanism and steal its use hold the cosmos in their hands and the myriad transformations within their bodies. Though water and fire are mutually destructive, they unite as husband and wife; though metal and wood are separated, they naturally communicate. Yet none in the world can see or know this—how lamentable!\n\nThe name defines the essence, while the term arises from nature. When metal returns to its original nature, it is called the Reverted Elixir. I dare not speak falsely, for I emulate the sages: the ancient texts speak of the Dragon and Tiger, the Yellow Emperor’s praise of Golden Flowers, Huainan’s refinement of Autumn Stone, and Wang Yang’s addition of Yellow Sprouts. The worthy may practice this, but the unworthy should not partake. The Dao of past and present arises from a single pair—let scholars exert effort, reflect deeply, and ponder its utmost importance. The words are clear and luminous, never deceiving me.\n\nThis explains why the Reverted Elixir is so named: \"revert\" refers to essence, \"elixir\" to nature. \"Metal returns to its original nature\" means that Metal Elder, born of my nature, now returns to its mother, reuniting with its origin. Together with the Maiden, it forms the infant—hence the Reverted Elixir. As the poem by Master Purple Yang says: *\"Metal Elder was originally the Eastern House’s child, sent to the Western Grove to lodge. Once recognized, call it home to nurture, betroth it to the Maiden, and unite in affection.\"* Though ancient and modern names differ, the Dao remains one.",
      "overlap_context": "nths and years pass, it nears decay, harming longevity. The body becomes like dust in a bright window.\n\nTo refine the great elixir, first use pure gold to construct the city walls, encircling them completely. Then take true water and place it within, so that no seepage occurs. Some call it the golden dike, others the city walls—both express this idea.\n\nTo build the golden dike, merely understand the principle that the Four Images and Five Phases fully rely on earth, and gold will naturally form.",

      "translated_text": "The *Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n*Explication of the Union of the Three in Accordance with the Book of Changes*, Scroll Middle\nBy Chen Xianwei of the Song Dynasty\n\n**Middle Scroll**\n\nThe firmness of Qian and the softness of Kun pair and envelop one another; yang endows while yin receives. Male and female depend on each other, and only then do essence and qi unfold to bring forth creation. Kan and Li crown the head, their radiance shining forth. Their profundity is difficult to fathom, and they cannot be depicted in diagrams. The sage measures and weighs, arranging the primordial foundation. The four are merged in primordial chaos, entering directly into the formless. The sixty hexagrams spread forth like a chariot’s canopy. The dragon-horse is harnessed, and the enlightened ruler takes the reins. When harmony prevails, one follows the level path; if not, the Way becomes perilous, the state topples, and the nation falls into danger.\n\nThe firmness of Qian and the softness of Kun—these two pair and alternately envelop one another, so that yang naturally endows while yin receives and conceals. For yang, being male, scatters and bestows, while yin, being female, contains and receives. Solitary yang does not generate; solitary yin does not nurture. Only when male and female depend on each other do essence and qi unfold and spread to complete creation. Just as the conception of a child invariably arises from the union of yin and yang, so too must Qian and Kun be taken as the beginning. Now, it is said that Kan and Li crown the head because Qian and Kun are Heaven and Earth, while Kan and Li are the Sun and Moon. Heaven and Earth, though fixed in position, cannot merge into one, yet within them, the Sun and Moon unite as one. Thus, Qian and Kun are the body of the medicine, while Kan and Li are its function. The reason only Kan and Li are said to crown the head is to clarify that the function of the great medicine lies entirely in Kan and Li. Therefore, Qian and Kun serve as the crucible, while Kan and Li serve as the medicine. Yet the function of Kan and Li operates between the two bodies of Qian and Kun, ascending and descending, flying and submerging without fixed form—how could this be easily depicted in diagrams?\n\nThe sage, wishing to measure and weigh its profound subtleties to instruct scholars, observes only the sixty hexagrams of Li and Kan, where one yang line and one yin line, sometimes above and sometimes below, are difficult to fathom. One must act like an enlightened ruler governing the times, taking the sixty hexagrams as a chariot and proceeding with effortless action to harness the dragon-horse. Then one may advance leisurely and steadily, progressing along the Way with grace and ease, the path smooth and unobstructed from beginning to end, cycling through all the hexagrams. How could there be peril or obstruction? Thus it is said: \"When harmony prevails, one follows the level path, free from deviation.\" If one fails to grasp this and recklessly follows a deviant path, there will be the worry of collapse and the fault of danger.\n\nLiu Haichan said, *\"Do not let the Purple Cart overturn,\"* which conveys the same meaning—though the path may be smooth, one must guard against peril and cannot be careless.\n\nThe noble person, dwelling in their chamber, speaks good words, and a thousand *li* away, they are answered. This is like the lord of ten thousand chariots, abiding in the innermost chamber, issuing decrees and commands in accordance with the rhythms of yin and yang, storing instruments and awaiting the proper time, never violating the hexagrams and months. *Zhun* begins at *zi*, and *Meng* at *yin*; the remaining sixty hexagrams each have their own days.\n\nFor those who cultivate the elixir, residing in seclusion for a year is especially arduous. Even the slightest movement has profound effects, like the lord of ten thousand chariots dwelling deep within the ninefold palace, where every action, stillness, word, and silence affects the harmony of Heaven. As the *Book of Changes* says, *\"The noble person dwells in their chamber, yet their influence extends a thousand *li*,\"* which serves as an apt comparison. One must follow the ascent and descent of yin and yang, advancing and halting in accordance with virtue, cherishing the treasure as if it were one’s eyes, nurturing the embryo as if holding a full vessel, awaiting the arrival of the proper time, never violating the hexagrams and months. *Zhun* spans from *zi* to *shen*, and *Meng* from *yin* to *xu*. The remaining hexagrams each have their own times, for each day comprises two hexagrams, and each hour, six lines. To discern yin and yang, one must distinguish day and night; to know day and night, one must distinguish light and dark. Once light and dark are distinguished, the hexagrams and lines are understood. As the *Book of Changes* says, *\"One who understands the Way of day and night knows this.\"*\n\nI have briefly presented the two images, though I have not fully exhausted their subtleties. Establishing principles and setting punishments, acting with benevolence and virtue—those who go against these meet misfortune, while those who follow them meet good fortune. According to the calendar, one must be sincere, focused, and meticulous, observing day and night, scrutinizing the ebb and flow. Even the slightest deviation brings regret and adversity.\n\nThe two images refer to *Zhun* and *Meng*. Not fully exhausting their subtleties means I dare not reveal the celestial mechanics of the fire times. When a scholar encounters a teacher and receives the method, they must act in accordance with the calendar, being sincere, focused, and meticulous, observing day and night, scrutinizing the ebb and flow. When yang arises, advance as if acting with benevolence and virtue; when yin arises, retreat as if establishing principles and setting punishments. Those who follow meet good fortune; those who go against meet misfortune. If even the slightest deviation occurs, regret and adversity arise within, becoming thieves and harm. Like weeds in a field or dust on a mirror, even those who refine cinnabar fear errors in water and fire—how much more so for this great elixir of golden liquid?\n\nAt the two solstices, the measures change, and if they go awry, complications arise. In the depths of winter, scorching heat; in the height of summer, frost and snow. At the two equinoxes, the directions are askew, the clepsydra’s flow unregulated, wind and rain untimely, floods and droughts contending, locusts swarming, and myriad anomalies emerging. Heaven displays its omens, mountains collapse, and the earth splits. The filial son’s sincerity moves the August Ultimate, bringing near what was uttered and spreading afar what was distant, sometimes inviting misfortune, sometimes bringing fortune, sometimes ushering in great peace, sometimes inciting war. These four outcomes arise from the heart’s intentions.\n\nThe two solstices mark the beginning of yin and yang. If their function goes awry, celestial anomalies follow—snow in summer, thunder in winter, and calamities arise. The two equinoxes are where yin and yang intersect. If their function goes awry, celestial anomalies likewise follow—mountains collapsing, the earth splitting, floods and droughts causing endless disasters. This occurs because those who regulate the fire lose the proper time, causing the true embryo to be harmed and the world to crumble. The filial son symbolizes the true embryo, and the August Ultimate symbolizes fortune and misfortune. Whether great peace or war arises, whether fortune or misfortune is invited, all stem from the intentions of those who regulate the fire. The method of refining the elixir is no different from the methods of the world. Yet the responses to governing the world are like echoes and shadows—how much more so when seizing the creation of Heaven and Earth, aligning one’s virtue with Heaven and Earth and synchronizing one’s movements with them?\n\nMovement and stillness have their constancy; one must adhere to the marking line. The four seasons proceed in harmony, aligning with qi. Firmness and softness are decisively distinguished, not intruding upon one another. The Five Phases each guard their boundaries, not recklessly expanding or contracting. The *Book of Changes* flows and circulates, bending and stretching, reversing and turning. As for the fire times and fortune and misfortune, as previously discussed, one must maintain constancy in movement and stillness, following the marking line without deviation. The four seasons proceed in harmony, naturally aligning with the two qi. Firmness does not overstep, and softness does not retreat. Whether bending or stretching, reversing or turning, the Five Phases circulate, each guarding their boundaries—only then can one be free from worry.\n\nBetween the dark and new moons, the tally is joined, and primordial chaos merges with the vast expanse. The female and male follow one another, their fluids moistening and nourishing, their transformations flowing and circulating. The spirits of Heaven and Earth cannot be measured. Utilizing them, one secures the body, concealing the form and hiding it. It begins in the northeast, in the region of *Ji* and *Dou*, then moves rightward, spewing forth the wheel and spitting out the sprout. Hidden in the deep pool, an image appears, scattering its essence and light.",

      "translated_text": "Between the dark and new moons, one must join the tally and move within the center, like primordial chaos merging with the vast expanse—beyond measure. This is the time when the female and male follow one another, their fluids moistening and nourishing, their transformations flowing and circulating. How could one apply effort here? Thus, by utilizing them, one secures the body, concealing the form and hiding it. It begins in the northeast, in the region of *Ji* and *Dou*, then moves rightward, spewing forth the wheel and spitting out the sprout, scattering its essence and light. As the poem by Hanshanzi says: *\"Do not expose the root, for the root will naturally fall.\"* The body and its function differ, and so too does the application of effort.\n\nAbove *Mao* and *Bi*, *Zhen* emerges as the faint yang qi begins its inception. In the *First Nine*, the hidden dragon lies low; yang is established by three, and yin is connected by eight. Thus, on the third day, *Zhen* stirs; on the eighth day, *Dui* moves. In the *Nine in the Third*, the dragon appears in the field, harmonious and luminous. The *Second* and *Fifth* virtues align, and the *Qian* body is complete. In the *Nine in the Third*, vigilance at dusk brings loss and decline to the spirit tally—its rise and fall are cut short, returning to its origin. *Xun* continues the lineage, firmly holding fast. In the *Nine in the Fourth*, one may leap forward or retreat, the Way perilous. *Gen* governs advance and cessation, not to be transgressed in time. On the twenty-third day, one guards the appointed term. In the *Nine in the Fifth*, the flying dragon ascends to the celestial position, adding joy. In the *Six in the Fifth*, *Kun* bears and binds, completing the cycle, nurturing all beings as the eternal mother. In the *Nine at the Top*, the dragon soars too high, its virtue cast into the wilds. With *Use the Nine*, it flutters as the Dao’s compass and square. When yang’s numbers are exhausted, they begin anew, turning to align with nature and unite with inherent qualities.\n\nWei Jun illustrates the waxing and waning of the moon within a month, likening it to the hexagrams’ advance and retreat: from the third day, the first yang arises; by the eighth day, the second yang; by the fifteenth, the third yang is complete, and the *Qian* body is formed. On the sixteenth, the first yin is born; by the twenty-third, the second yin; by the thirtieth, the third yin is complete, and the *Kun* body is perfected. *Mao* and *Bi* reside in the west, in the position of *Geng*, as mentioned in the previous volume. *Zhen* and *Geng* appearing in the west share the same meaning, as previously described in detail. Wei Jun repeats this to deepen the learner’s understanding of body and function.\n\nFollowing the turning of the celestial pivot, ascending and descending, rising and falling, the six lines circulate in a cycle difficult to perceive—thus, they have no fixed position, becoming the ancestral source of the *Yi*. Within a single day, the fire phases revolve like the turning of the celestial pivot: from *Zi*, ascending to *Wu*, then descending, traversing the six lines. Though no visible traces can be observed, the subtle workings of creation are guarded in the heart. At these times, the elixir medicine arrives with the sun, ascending and descending, rising and falling without cease—never occupying a fixed position. This aligns with the *Great Yi*’s principle of yang ascending and yin descending. That it is called the ancestral source of the *Yi* means the sages first grasped the principle of golden elixir through self-cultivation, transcending the mundane to attain sagehood, and only afterward expounded this principle in the *Yi* to instruct later generations. Thus, the *Great Yi* was created based on the great elixir, and the Way of the great elixir is the ancestral source of the *Yi*.\n\nAt the dawn of the new moon, *Fu* arises, and yang qi begins to flow, entering and exiting without haste. Erect a subtle marker of firmness: the *Yellow Bell* is established in *Zi*, its signs flourishing, spreading warmth and gentle steam, allowing the common people to thrive in constancy. At midnight, the *Zi* hour, the fire phase begins its work. Before the first yang arises, the fire phase remains still, and the multitude of yin gathers like the masses without governance. Once the fire phase stirs, yang qi begins to flow, spreading warmth and gentle steam, suffusing the cauldron with radiance. When the first signs appear, it becomes the master of all transformations. At this time, the cultivator must silently guard the mechanism of advancing the fire, using subtle firmness as the standard. Entering and exiting, coming and going, gathering and releasing proceed without haste, naturally nourishing and gradually increasing until pure *Qian* and *Kun* refine the precious treasure. In the initial stages, one must be especially cautious. As the ancients’ poem says: *\"On cold nights, tend the fire; guard against the crowd until dawn.\"* This embodies the meaning of *\"spreading warmth and gentle steam, allowing the common people to thrive in constancy.\"*\n\nIn *Lin*, the furnace is tended, the path opened, and the radiance gradually advances, growing day by day. In *Chou*, the *Great Lü* is established, its structure rising and falling. At the *Chou* hour, the second yang fire phase advances. By this time, the radiance gradually increases, opening the mysterious path and illuminating the true light. Yang arises from below, so one must bind it there. At this stage, the work is lowly; after passing this line, one gradually lifts and follows the transformative mechanism—thus, *\"its structure rises and falling.\"*\n\nRaising it forms *Tai*, where firmness and softness flourish together, yin and yang intertwine, the small departs and the great arrives, converging in *Yin* and advancing with the season. At the *Yin* hour, the third yang fire phase advances. By this time, firmness and softness are distinct, yin and yang each half. Above is water, below is fire—essence-water ascends, spirit-fire descends. The ascending seeks to rise, the descending seeks to fall; yin and yang intertwine, the small departs and the great arrives, and creation converges here.\n\nGradually progressing through *Dazhuang*, arrayed at the *Mao* gate, the elm pods fall and return to their root. Punishment and virtue contend, and day and night begin to divide. At the *Mao* hour, the fourth yang undergoes the bathing phase. At this time, day and night divide, life and death are balanced, and all things flourish in spring—yet the elm pods alone fall. This is because the elm pods correspond to the stars, and by dawn, they wither. The golden elixir parallels the myriad phenomena, and all phenomena arise from the sun and moon.\n\nIn *Guai*, yin retreats as yang ascends, washing and cleansing the wings, shaking off the dust of the roost. At the *Chen* hour, the fifth yang fire phase advances. By this time, the fifth yang ascends, and the water source is clear and limpid, like a bird emerging from water, shaking its wings, preparing to soar into the heavens.\n\nIn *Qian*, vigor flourishes, its brightness spreading to the four neighbors. Yang culminates in the center of *Si*, and the spirit is full. At the *Si* hour, the sixth yang fire phase advances. By this time, the pure *Qian* body is complete, the moon full, the water abundant, the light flourishing, and the spirit full—upright yet not biased, round yet not lacking, its radiance spreading to the four directions, illuminating all ten directions.\n\nIn *Gou*, the beginning is recorded, treading frost first, like the cold spring at the well’s bottom. *Wu* guards the guest, the guest concealed within yin, yin as the host. At the *Wu* hour, the first yin tally retreats. By this time, yin is the host and yang the guest. If one fails to recognize the host within the guest and the guest within the host, the slightest deviation brings great harm.

      "translated_text": "At the *You* hour, the fourth yin tally retreats—this is the bathing phase. Shepherd’s purse and wheat respond to the sun, so by the eighth month their sprouts emerge. The sun’s essence is conceived at *You*, for wood is nurtured within at this time, and earth undergoes its bathing. Thus, *You* marks the bathing phase.\n\nIn *Bo*, the limbs rot and the form dissolves, its transformation into qi exhausted, its spirit lost.\n\nAt the *Xu* hour, the fifth yin tally retreats. When the Dao is exhausted, it returns to Kun’s primal origin. In solemn compliance with earth’s principles, it bears heaven’s mandate and spreads its decree.\n\nAt the *Hai* hour, the sixth yin tally retreats. The profound and distant, though separated by barriers, remain connected in resonance. It nurtures the seed, the source of yin and yang, vast and indistinct, its beginning unknowable. Those who lose their way first become lost, while those who follow later become masters. Without a level ruler, the Dao naturally inclines. Its transformations alternate in waxing and waning, ever responsive. From Kun’s end arises Fu’s beginning, like tracing an unbroken ring. Emperors and kings ride this principle, enduring for a thousand generations.\n\nThe magnet’s attraction of iron, the burning mirror’s capture of fire, the moon’s gathering of water—all exemplify the mutual resonance of yin and yang, their barriers transcended. How could one fathom its beginnings? In the practice of elixir refinement, one first wanders in confusion, but once the fire-tending is complete and the elixir’s power matures, one then knows the riding of [lacuna]—this Dao is nothing other than the mechanism of Kun’s end and Fu’s beginning. Master Wei repeatedly expounded this, and his clarity was exhaustive.\n\nTo cultivate nature and prolong life, one must reverse the sequence: first consider what comes later, then attend to what precedes. The body one inherits is originally undifferentiated, its primordial essence dispersed, its qi the foundation of its inception.\n\nBlood and qi each possess their own nature, and this nature never deviates from the upright. Blood and qi each possess their own destiny, and this destiny never strays from emotion. Yet while nature is fundamentally upright, when one loses the true nature and sinks into depravity, one may become a villain, a serpent, a scorpion, or some monstrous transformation—such are those whose nature becomes perverse. While destiny is rooted in emotion, when one awakens the mind and perceives nature, understanding that all beings owe their existence to desire, one refines essence into qi, ascends to sagehood, and transcends the mundane—such are those whose destiny becomes upright.\n\nConsider this: when a person first receives their bodily form, it is fundamentally an upright nature. Yet when parents unite in passion, is the primordial qi they disperse truly upright? Does it arise from emotion? The *Yuanjue Jing* states that destiny arises from desire—this aligns with the present discussion.\n\nYin and yang serve as the measure, the dwelling of hun and po. The yang spirit is the sun’s hun, the yin spirit the moon’s po. Hun and po mutually serve as abodes. Nature presides within, establishing the inner citadel; emotion operates without, constructing the outer walls. When the walls are complete, beings find peace.\n\nAt this time, emotion harmonizes with Qian and Kun. Qian moves and extends, its qi spreading, its essence flowing. Kun is still and receptive, becoming the Dao’s dwelling. The firm acts and retreats; the yielding transforms and nourishes. Nine returns, seven reversions, eight returns, six residences—male appears white, female appears red. Metal and fire restrain each other, then water settles. Fire, the first of the five phases, is supremely good like water—clear and flawless. The Dao’s form resembles the True One, difficult to depict. Though it transforms and disperses, each phase dwells in its own place.\n\nEmotion and nature arise from hun and po; hun and po arise from light and darkness; light and darkness arise from the sun and moon; the sun and moon arise from yin and yang. The sage infers this from Qian and Kun’s firmness and yielding, movement and stillness, opening and closing—thus the Great Elixir’s Dao accords with the *Great Change*. Its essence lies in nothing other than yin and yang as the measure.\n\nThus, when the sun rises at *Mao*, the sky brightens and hun flourishes. When the sun sets at *You*, the sky darkens and po flourishes. Hun is the yang spirit, po the yin spirit. Hun’s chamber is day, po’s dwelling is night—yet in truth, they do not transcend the two mechanisms of light and darkness.\n\nWhen people are awake in daylight, they employ hun and spirit, for hun’s essence is nature. When night falls, they return to essence and po, for essence and po are destiny. Destiny generates emotion, so essence and po become the outer walls. Nature generates the mind, so preserving the mind’s spirit becomes the inner citadel. When the walls are firm, beings find peace. At this time, when emotion operates externally, Qian and Kun unite, and the principles of firmness and yielding, movement and stillness, opening and closing are realized.\n\nThen, a single circulation of qi pervades the great void. Ascending and descending, all is transformed in undifferentiated chaos. The true earth, nine metals, eight woods, seven fires, six waters—all return and reside, each entering into earth. When they return to earth, the five phases are complete, and the myriad things are born within it. The male appears in white form, the female in red hue. The five phases gather and restrain one another: metal and fire contend, fire smelts metal, and metal encases water like boiling soup in a cauldron. The cauldron is heated in the furnace, and the metal furnace blazes. Here, water, metal, and fire are all within earth. Where there is fire, wood naturally exists. Once the transformations are complete, lead congeals and mercury coalesces within the crucible—then water’s function is the highest good.\n\nThe supreme treasure is flawless; the utmost reality is difficult to grasp. When the fire-tending is sufficient and the five phases disperse, each dwells in its own place without encroachment.\n\nLike a chicken’s egg, black and white support each other, its length and breadth a single inch—this is the beginning. The four limbs, five viscera, sinews, and bones all develop within. After ten months, it emerges from the womb, its bones pliable enough to coil, its flesh smooth as lead. Its length is an inch, its width slightly narrower. The Dharma-body resides within. The ancients...",

      "translated_text": "Should one ask, \"Why not leap beyond the radiance of the pearl?\"—then let the inner body surge forth, ascending straight to the Purple Tenuity Palace. The yang-burning mirror draws fire, yet without the sun, no light is born; the moonlit vessel gathers dew, yet without stars and moon, how could water be obtained? The two qi, profound and distant, still respond to transformation—how much more so when near at hand, stored within the heart and breast? Yin and yang pair as sun and moon; water and fire serve as their signs.\n\nThe *yang-sui* is a mirror forged from five-colored stone, which, when turned toward the sun with mugwort, captures fire. The *Huainanzi* calls it the \"fire vessel.\" There is also the \"water vessel,\" a moonlit orb of crystal that, when turned toward the moon, gathers fire—this is called the *yin-sui*. Without the aid of sun and moon, neither vessel can generate water or draw fire. Within the human body, the ascent and descent of yin and yang move in harmony with the transformations of heaven and earth. How could the principle of water and fire’s communion lie beyond the mechanism of the sun and moon’s ebb and flow, by which we seek verification?\n\nThe three treasures—ears, eyes, and mouth—must be firmly sealed, their apertures unopened. The Perfected One, concealed in the deep abyss, floats and drifts, abiding within the compass of the center. Whether turning or bending, seeing or hearing, opening or closing, all are governed by the self’s pivot. In movement and stillness, unceasing, the inner *qi* of *li* and *kan* nurtures defense and nourishment. The ears do not employ their acuity; the mouth does not engage in speech. Rare words follow the flow of the primordial flood. Once these three are secured, the body relaxes in an empty chamber, the will entrusted to emptiness. Absence of thought becomes the norm; the mind, undistracted, does not stray. In sleep, spirit and soul embrace; upon waking, one attends to the signs of presence and absence. The complexion gradually moistens; the bones and joints grow ever stronger. Expelling the host of yin’s perverse influences, one then establishes the true yang, cultivating it without cease. The *qi* of clouds and rain moves in gentle descent, like spring’s drizzle, like melting ice. From the head it flows to the feet, then ascends once more, circulating through the boundless. The returning glow within is the proof of the Dao; suppleness is the handle of virtue. Weeding and hoeing the long-accumulated filth, even the finest dust is smoothed away. The path of the turbid is made clear; long dimness is illuminated.\n\nIf the ears do not listen, the water of *kan* inwardly clarifies. If the eyes do not see, the fire of *li* inwardly nourishes. If the mouth does not speak, the metal of *dui* remains silent. Once these three are closed, the Perfected One roams freely within. One must employ absence of thought and worry, not indulge in toil. The will is entrusted to emptiness; the mind, undiverted, does not wander. To relax the body in an empty chamber—what other purpose is there? It is simply that one must embrace the feminine, hold to the One, and soften the body, dwelling alone in stillness. In sleep, spirit and soul embrace; upon waking, one attends to the signs of presence and absence. Then, expelling the perverse yin, pure yang accumulates within the body. Supreme harmony overflows, like melting ice, like spring’s gentle rain. The *qi* of clouds moves like mist, ascending and descending, flowing from head to feet. Cultivating this without cease, filth is wholly removed, sinews and bones harmonized, the complexion luminous, the bones and joints firm. The blood transforms into white marrow; spirit and form attain perfection. Yet once the seven gates are returned, one seems nearly lifeless: the hundred vessels sink, the form and *qi* dissolve, strength fails, and one cannot rise. Dazed and turbid, as if drunk—this is the proof of the Dao, the handle of virtue.\n\nDimness is the foundation of clarity; turbidity is the source of purity. From this point onward, round brilliance pervades, empty and penetrating, numinous and unobstructed—yet all begins in dimness and turbidity. Worldly people favor petty arts, failing to discern the depth of the Dao. They abandon the true and follow the perverse, seeking shortcuts that lead nowhere, like the blind refusing a staff, or the deaf attempting to hear the *shang* note. They fish for pheasants and hares in the water, hunt for dragons and fish on the mountain, plant wheat hoping for millet, or use a compass to seek a square. They exhaust their spirit and strength year after year, yet see no result.\n\nWould you know the method of ingesting the elixir? It is simple, not complex. Worldly people abandon the true and follow the perverse, indulging in petty arts, wasting their minds and strength until old age, yet achieving nothing. How could they know the wonder of the Great Dao, which is utterly simple, utterly easy, concise and not cumbersome?\n\nThe flowing pearl of the Great Yang ever seeks to depart from man. Should one suddenly obtain the Golden Flower, it turns and binds with it, transforming into a white liquid, congealing into something most firm. The Golden Flower first intones, and in a moment, dissolves into the Water Horse’s teeth, the langgan jade. The yang then harmonizes, and the nature of the emotions naturally hastens. When the time is right, yin gathers and restrains, the gate of compassion nurtures, the filial child repays kindness, the stern father issues commands, and the descendants are taught. The five phases clash and contend, fire’s nature melts metal, metal fells wood, and flourishing arises. The Three and Five unite with the One; heaven and earth’s purest essence can be transmitted by oral instruction but cannot be written in words.\n\nMan’s life resides in *mao*; the sun emerges from *mao*, and the myriad things depend on it for birth. Thus, all things rely on the essence of the Great Yang to establish their lives. The flowing pearl of the Great Yang is the treasure of life. When this life-treasure lodges in spirit, it flits about in confusion; confused thoughts chase after things and are transformed. When it lodges in essence, it is difficult to preserve fullness; instability leads to scattered thoughts and leaking desires. Thus it is said: \"It ever seeks to depart from man.\" Yet few among worldly people know this principle; even fewer, though they know it, can preserve it.",

      "translated_text": "Yet the treasure of the Great Yang is fundamentally the essence of the wood-soul. If it obtains the golden radiance to subdue and master it, it transforms into a white liquid, congealing into the yellow sprout—like horse’s teeth or lustrous jade. Confined and nurtured within the Gate of *you*, it undergoes transformation. The method follows the principle of the Five Phases’ mutual consumption: as a father drives his son, as a son returns to his mother, as a mother nurtures, as a child repays kindness. Thus, one first employs fire to melt metal, then metal to fell wood—all like a stern father driving his son. Thereafter, it transforms into the Eight Waters, which are the mother of wood. Hence it is said: \"The mother nurtures.\" Once more it congeals into metal-water, which is the child of metal. The child transforms into the mother, and thus it is said: \"The child repays kindness.\" Its essentials do not exceed the Three, the Five, and the One. The Three, the Five, and the One—these three characters—are such that those who truly understand them in ancient and modern times are indeed rare. Unless one encounters a perfected person to transmit the oral instructions, how could one lightly presume to fathom the celestial mechanism through written words?\n\nAlas! Consider the mid-winter season, when grasses and trees are all withered and harmed, aiding the Yang to interrogate the traveling merchants. The noble ruler deeply conceals himself, aligning with the season’s rhythms, closing his mouth and refraining from discoursing on the Dao of Heaven—so vast, so profound, formless and boundless, invisible and unfathomable. How could one rely on mere frameworks to dispel errors and avoid the entanglements of misguided words, which only bring self-defeat? Thus, I distinguish these Four Images to enlighten later generations of the blind.\n\nAt the mid-winter season, the myriad things return to their roots. At this time, the workings of creation are inscrutable. Observing the Dao of Heaven, one finds it sealed and impassable, vast and unknowable. Examining the Great Profundity, one finds it empty and still, swirling without form. On what basis, then, could one fathom the mechanism of creation? Master Wei distinguished the Four Images to instruct later generations, as set forth in the following chapter.\n\nWhen *zi* turns right, *wu* rotates east; *mao* and *you* form the boundary between host and guest. The dragon calls to the tiger, the tiger inhales the dragon’s essence. Both feast upon each other, each coveting the other’s glory, until they interlock, swallow, chew, and devour one another. When Mars guards the west and Venus traverses the heavens, the killing energy descends—what could withstand its overthrow? The fox and dog guard against it, birds and sparrows fear the goshawk. Each fulfills its function—how dare they make a sound?\n\n*Zi* turns right to come east, *wu* rotates east to come west to *you*—each traverses nine revolutions. Thus, the dragon emerges from within fire, the tiger is born within water. Mars guards the west to restrain metal, Venus traverses the heavens and appears by day. Naturally, the dragon calls to the tiger, the tiger inhales the dragon’s essence. Master Zhongli’s poem says: \"Do not say this body is the Dao, cultivated alone; a single thing is but solitary Yin. Know that the Dao is the union of one Yin and one Yang. Only after male and female unite, essence intermingles, and the myriad things are transformed, can one speak of the Returned Elixir. If the two things do not unite, the Three and Five do not intersect, water and fire remain unbridged, hardness and softness separate—then Yin and Yang are cut off, heaven and earth sealed. This is what is called ‘partial Yin, partial Yang’—a malady indeed.\"\n\nKan (the trigram) is the male, the moon; Li is the female, the sun. The sun bestows its virtue, the moon unfurls its light. The moon receives the sun’s transformation, its body unharmed. If the Yang loses its contract, the Yin encroaches upon its brightness; at conjunction and opposition, eclipses occur, one overshadowing the other. The Yang’s form is consumed, the Yin’s calamity arises. Male and female require each other, inhaling and exhaling to nourish; female and male intermingle, seeking one another.\n\nThat by which heaven and earth endure is the sun and moon’s reciprocal movement, Yin and Yang’s mutual containment and support to emit radiance. If even one deviates from its measure, there arises the peril of eclipses. The Kan and Li of man are like the sun and moon of heaven and earth—how could one not steal the mechanism of heaven and earth?\n\nMetal transforms into water, and water’s nature is pervasive. Fire transforms into earth, and water cannot flow. Thus, the male moves and externally bestows, the female is still and internally conceals. If the overflow exceeds its measure, it is restrained by the female; the po controls the hun, preventing excess. Neither cold nor heat, advancing and retreating in timely fashion, each attains harmony and together they emit confirming signs.\n\nThis speaks of the marvel of metal-water as husband and wife, water-fire as mates. Metal generates water, and water’s nature is moist. Without earth to restrain it, there would inevitably be the peril of overflow. Wood generates fire, fire generates earth, and only when earth is generated can water be restrained, gathered, stored, and mated with fire. Thus, metal and wood, though mutually destructive, become husband and wife by virtue of fire’s power. Water and fire, though mutually destructive, become mates by virtue of earth’s power. Thereafter, advancing and retreating in timely fashion, each attains harmony and manifests transformations in accord with the season, together emitting confirming signs.\n\nCinnabar is the essence of wood. When it obtains metal, they unite; where metal and water converge, wood and fire become companions. The four intermingle in chaos, arrayed as dragon and tiger. The dragon is Yang, its number odd; the tiger is Yin, its number even. The liver, green, is the father; the lungs, white, are the mother; the kidneys, black, are the child; the spleen, yellow, is the ancestor. The child and the Five Phases begin with three things—a single family all returning to *wu* and *si*.\n\nMetal and wood—A and Geng—mutually support each other’s use, for both embrace true earth. Metal (four) and water (one) combine to transform into earth (five). Wood (three) and fire (two) combine to transform into earth (five). Though the dragon of eastern wood and the tiger of western metal—east three and west four—are odd and even, unequal, when divided into three families and united into one dwelling, they all return to *wu-si*.\n\nHardness and softness alternate in ascent, traversing the divisions. The dragon is west, the tiger east; *mao* and *you* establish the warp, punishment and virtue are both contained, and they meet in joy. Punishment governs subduing and killing, virtue governs generation and ascent. In the second month, the elm withers, the Dipper points to *mao*; in the eighth month, wheat sprouts, the Celestial Stem resides in *you*. *Zi* is south, *wu* is north, mutually serving as the guiding principles. The number one-nine ends and begins anew, containing the Primordial within the Void and Danger, sowing essence in *zi*.\n\nFrom *zi* to *si* is Qian, the hard; from *wu* to *hai* is Kun, the soft. Understanding this principle of alternating ascent, one naturally finds the dragon in the west, the tiger in the east; *zi* in the south, *wu* in the north; *mao* and *you* establishing the warp; generation and killing, ascent and subduing, mutually serving as guiding principles, each attaining its time. In the second month, generation begins, and *you* descends upon it—thus the elm dies and returns to its root. In the eighth month, killing and subduing prevail, and *mao* descends upon it—thus shepherd’s purse and wheat sprout. From *you* to *mao*, proceeding in nine revolutions, one then sees *zi* in the south. From *mao* to *you*, reversing in nine revolutions, one then sees the Void and Danger in the north. This is what is meant by \"the number one-nine contains the Primordial within the Void and Danger, sowing essence in *zi*.\"\n\nThe *guan-guan* ospreys on the river isle, the graceful and virtuous maiden—how the noble man longs for her! The male does not dwell alone, the female does not live in solitude. The dark warrior and the coiling dragon, the entwined serpents—all illustrate how male and female must rely on each other. Suppose two women share a chamber, their complexions fair, and one sends Su Qin to convey words, Zhang Yi to arrange the match, untying their braids, loosening their tongues, flaunting their eloquence, and deploying honeyed speech to persuade and harmonize, intending to unite as husband and wife. Yet even if their hair rots and their teeth decay, they will never know each other. If the medicinal substances are not of the same kind, their *qi* and essences differ, their measures and timings are misaligned, and their guiding principles lost—then even if the Yellow Emperor tends the furnace, Taiyi wields the fire, the Eight Lords pound and refine, Huainan harmonizes the mixture, a towering altar is raised, jade steps and terraces built, unicorn jerky and dried meat offered, registers held, long kneeling in prayer, spirits and deities entreated, the hundred demons beseeched, ablutions and fasting observed, all in hope of some result—it would be like using glue to mend a cauldron, salt to treat a wound, adding ice to dispel cold, or boiling water to make serpents dance. The more one does, the more perverse it becomes.",

      "translated_text": "This speaks of the Dao/Way as the union of one yin and one yang; what is solely yin or solely yang is called illness. If one attains their proper pairing, without expending further effort, they naturally commune to form the sacred embryo. If one fails to attain their proper pairing, then all labor is in vain, spirit and thought squandered—nothing can be achieved, and the more one strives, the more perverse it becomes.\n\n*Explanation of the Zhouyi Cantong Qi, Middle Scroll*\n*Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n*Explanation of the Zhouyi Cantong Qi, Lower Scroll*\nBy Chen Xianwei of the Song Dynasty\n\n**Lower Scroll**\n\nIn ancient times, the sages and worthies embraced the mysterious and held fast to the true. They ingested the Nine Cauldrons, refined their transformations, concealed their traces, and merged with the depths. They nurtured essence, cultivated spirit, and communicated virtue with the Three Luminaries. Their fluids and textures, sinews and bones, became firm; all perverse influences were dispelled, and the true *qi* remained ever-present. Through long accumulation, they transformed their forms and became immortals.\n\nMoved by compassion for later generations who love the Dao, they followed the winds of antiquity, traced the outlines of past and present, and inscribed them in charts and texts to enlighten posterity. They revealed the branches and leaves while concealing the root, designating them under various names and covering them with stones. Thus, the learned scholars who obtained these works treasured them in caskets, passing them down through generations—sons following fathers, grandsons treading in their ancestors’ steps. Yet the world remained deluded, utterly without understanding. Officials abandoned their posts, farmers neglected their plows, merchants forsook their goods, and scholars of resolve impoverished their families. I grieve deeply for this.\n\nThus, I have set down these words, concise and easy to ponder, sparing in detail yet not prolix. I lay out their principles, verify their substance, and make them observable. Their measures have numbers, and by following them in sequence, one may avoid disorder. Though the language may seem tangled, its gates and apertures are clear. Those who understand will reflect deeply, applying their minds to these matters.\n\nMaster Wei, concerned that the world would not grasp these truths, again pointed to the ancient sages and worthies who embraced the mysterious and held fast to the true. None failed to ingest the Nine Cauldrons and communicate virtue with the Three Luminaries, thereby dispelling perversity, preserving the true, transforming their forms, and becoming immortals. Moved by compassion for later generations who love the Dao, he saw that those who falsely annotated and practiced the immortals’ scriptures not only lacked understanding themselves but also led their descendants into delusion. Thus, he grieved deeply and composed this scroll.\n\nNo image is greater than Heaven and Earth. The mysterious gully spans ten thousand *li*; the River Drum faces the Star Marker. The people are all alarmed; the shadow of the gnomon falsely advances, bringing nine years of misfortune. The August Emperor gazes upon it, and the king retreats to reform himself. The key has its highs and lows; harm and *qi* flee in haste. The rivers and Huai run dry, their eastward flow pouring into the sea. Heaven and Earth’s male and female wander between *zi* and *wu*, *yin* and *shen*, the ancestors of yin and yang. They emerge and enter, complete their beginnings and ends, follow the Dipper and summon the Handle, wield the balance and fix the primal record.\n\nSteam rises from Mount Zeng; the blazing fire is set below. The White Tiger sings and leads ahead; the azure fluid harmonizes behind. The Vermilion Bird soars and plays, its flying feathers five-colored. It encounters a net spread wide, pressed down and unable to rise. Its cries are mournful, like a child longing for its mother. Overturned into the boiling cauldron, its feathers and wings are crushed and broken. Before half a *ke* has passed, fish scales and manes arise. The five colors dazzle, transformations ceaseless. The cauldron bubbles and boils violently, surging without rest. Layer upon layer, they pile up like interlocking dog’s teeth. Their forms resemble midwinter ice; *langgan* jade and stalactites jut forth, tangled and interlaced, propping one another up.\n\nIn this passage, Master Wei fully reveals the mysterious gates and images to instruct others.\n\nWhen yin and yang attain their pairing, they dwell in tranquil harmony. The Green Dragon guards Room Four in spring, the Wood of *zhen* in the east. The White Tiger resides in *chou* Seven in autumn, the Metal of *dui* in the west. The Vermilion Bird is in Zhang Six in summer, the Fire of *li* in the south. When these three come to court together, their households become kin. From two substances at the root, three emerge at the end. Three and five, five and one—all gather and return to two. The governance of the above is as prescribed; the days’ numbers are also taken from the beginning.\n\nFirst white, then yellow; red and black penetrate within and without. This is called the First Cauldron, its sustenance like grains of millet. It is the natural workings, without falsehood or deception. The Dao is like the *qi* of mountains steaming on its own, rising as clouds to become rain. When mud dries, it turns to dust; when fire dies, it becomes earth. As *bo* dyes yellow, indigo turns green; as hides and leather are boiled into glue, yeast ferments into wine. Though the substances are the same, skill is difficult to apply if not of the same kind. Only this wondrous art is precise and not deceptive. Transmitted to a hundred million generations, it shines forth, verifiable as the stars crossing the Han, radiant as the source of the sea. Ponder it thoroughly, revisit it again and again. After a thousand cycles, ten thousand repetitions, it will gleam resplendently. Then one may behold it. The divine may reveal it to others, or the heart may suddenly awaken. Seek its threads, trace its beginnings, and you will find its gates and doors. The Dao of Heaven is impartial; it is always transmitted to the worthy.\n\nThe Great Elixir of the Nine Cauldrons refers to the supreme divine elixir, the great ninefold refinement. This is the peerless, most true medicine, transcending the Three Realms. Even the elixir of the First Cauldron requires the lesser ninefold refinement to complete its form, resembling grains of millet—this is the image of the mysterious pearl. Its appearance may be white, yellow, blue, black, or red, never fixed in color. It resembles a true pearl, which the ancients called the *mani* jewel, ever displaying five colors. It is also said to resemble cinnabar in form, though cinnabar is not inherently red—these are all firsthand accounts. Other false descriptions, with a thousand depictions, are self-deception. What benefit is there in speaking recklessly before understanding, thereby inviting blame? Better to diligently and earnestly seek a teacher, inquire of the Dao, and reach the place of personal witness before speaking. Even then, it is not too late. If one attains it in the body but does not speak of it, what harm is there?\n\nMaster Wei exhorts scholars to thoroughly read this book a thousand times, ten thousand times, with utmost sincerity and without negligence. Perhaps the divine will reveal it to others, or the heart will awaken on its own. Naturally, one will seek its threads and find its gates and doors. This is what is meant by \"the Dao of Heaven is impartial; it is always transmitted to the worthy.\"\n\nI once composed the *Establishing the Sacred* as the first scroll, saying: \"The Great Dao is impartial; when moved, the immortals come.\" How could these words be empty? If one does not strive to seek lead and mercury, how can one grasp the celestial mechanism and shed the sacred embryo? This is the same intent.\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* broadly expounds its outlines but cannot maintain purity; its explanations overflow, yet the subtle details remain incomplete. Omissions and gaps abound, resembling yet not quite matching. Thus, I have compiled and supplemented these records to fill the omissions, refine the obscure, and draw connections to ensure coherence. I have guarded against inconsistency in intent and direction, not deviating from the original. I have thus composed this, ordering the Five Phases and their pairings. Then the nature and essence of the *Great Change* are fully illuminated.\n\nWhen the Five Phases attain their proper unions, each has its pairing.",

      "translated_text": "Yi (☲, Floating Left), Ding (☲, Civil Fire), Ji (Earth), Xin (☻, Common Silver), and Gui (Lead);\nThree Woods, Two Fires, Five Earths, Four Metals, and One Water.\nJia (☷, Sinking Right), Bing (☲, Martial Fire), Wu (Earth), Geng (☲, Common Gold), and Ren (Mercury).\n\nThe nature and essence of the *Great Change* each conform to their measures. The Yellow Emperor and Laozi investigated and compared them, enabling mastery of the furnace and fire arts with true foundation. Among the Three Ways, all emerge from the same path.\n\nHow vast is the Dao as Dao! It gives birth to Heaven and Earth, nurtures the myriad things, and eludes even the transformations of creation. The sage cannot name it. Fu Xi followed its measures to compose the *Yi*; the Yellow Emperor and Laozi probed its subtleties to attain the principle of emptiness and spontaneity. The furnace and fire arts steal its mechanism to obtain the method of refining gold and drying mercury. All these—whether observed in the heavens or on earth, drawn from afar or near, expressed in words, cultivated in the body, or entrusted to things—though divided into Three Ways, ultimately return to One.\n\nBranches, stems, flowers, and leaves bear fruit, yet all depend on the root. Without losing its original simplicity, the heart’s sincere words are precise and unerring. The Dao does not reside in words; words are but branches, stems, flowers, and leaves. Words guard intent, and intent bears fruit. Intent guards the Dao, and the Dao is the root. Branches and leaves are easily seen, fruit easily known, but the root is difficult to see and know. Words are easily known, intent easily guarded, yet those who attain the Dao’s subtlety are few. Yet though the root lies hidden, it reveals itself in leaves and stems; the profound Dao, though obscure, is made manifest in speech. How much more so with Master Wei’s sincere words, precise and unadorned? It rests with the scholar to delve deeply and grasp it for themselves.\n\nI, a humble man of Kuaiji, dwell in a secluded valley, embracing simplicity. I disdain glory and honor, retreat to obscurity, and disregard fame and profit. Abiding in tranquility and peace, I have composed this text, singing of the *Great Change* and the Three Sages’ legacy, examining their shared intent and unifying their discourse.\n\nMaster Wei was born in Shangyu, Kuaiji, during the Eastern Han. Embracing simplicity and disregarding fame and profit, he dwelled in seclusion to study the Dao, silently cultivating truth. Though his teacher’s name is unknown, he delved deeply into the profound, attaining the mysteries of the Great One’s Fire Talisman, the Golden Liquor, the Nine Revolutions, and the Great Return’s divine elixir. Having benefited himself, he sought to benefit others, composing this text to enlighten later learners. His merit is great, his virtue abundant, yet he still humbly called himself coarse and decayed. How modest was this perfected man!\n\nThis work aligns with the intent and great unity of the *Great Change* composed by the Three Sages, hence its title, *Cantong Qi*.\n\nIts purpose lies in following principle, illuminating the spirit, and ensuring the circulation of divine transformation, bringing peace to the Four Seas and serving as a model for ten thousand generations. It can be applied to governance without complexity, guiding inner cultivation to align with the Yellow Emperor and Laozi’s natural Way, embodying the profound virtue of returning to the root and reverting to the origin—close at hand within the heart, inseparable from the self. Embracing the One without abandonment ensures longevity. Combined with dietary practices—arranging the male and female, refining and subduing Wudu’s eight minerals—one discards what the world treasures.\n\nThose who read this book must follow the principle of the *Great Change*’s mutual resonance, seeking it within themselves. If the text’s discussions of divine transformations and changes are returned to the subtleties of spirit and heart, then the wonder of entering the spirit and applying it is attained. Once this wonder is attained, the immortal Dao is achieved. Yet not only those who study immortality and the Dao rely on this book. If applied to governance, its practice is effortless, and the Four Seas are at peace. If used as a model for calendrics, divine transformation flows, and ten thousand generations follow it. If employed for inner cultivation, it harmonizes with the Yellow Emperor and Laozi’s natural Way, containing the virtue of returning to truth and reverting to the origin. Paired with dietary practices, it arranges the male and female, refining and subduing them. But the world must not mistake these for external medicines. If recklessly treated as external medicines, refining and ingesting Wudu’s realgar, the Four Spirits, and the eight minerals, one strays far from the Dao. Yet if their use is carefully applied to the furnace and fire arts, one can refine common silver into gold and dry mercury into silver, which the world may treasure.\n\nThree paths are arrayed, their branches connected, emerging under different names yet all from one gate. This is no mere accumulation of parallel phrases or harmonious couplets; the text contains true substance, worthy of contemplation. Had I fabricated falsehoods, I would have incurred praise and blame, but I have titled it *Cantong Qi*, glimpsing its subtleties. Its words are few, its intent vast. Later generations should follow it, casting off harm, relying on mountains, wandering the vast expanse, and befriending immortals. Transforming the body to become immortal, they will roam in silence, descending to the human world once in a hundred generations, displaying their feathered wings, soaring east and west, south and north. Though Yao and Tang suffered calamities—floods and droughts—separating them, with branches and leaves withering and losing their splendor, the auspicious person rides upon them, secure and stable, attaining long life.\n\nThis book’s three chapters largely share similar beginnings and endings. Master Wei expounded the elixir path repeatedly, reiterating his words so that learners might grasp the coherence from start to finish. Thus, he said this book’s three paths are like branches connected, their words and metaphors differing as if emerging from separate roads, yet in truth, they are one gate. How could this be mere harmonious couplets or accumulated phrases for elegant recitation? It truly contains profound principles, worthy of contemplation. Hence, he titled it *Cantong Qi*.\n\nHaving revealed this book to later generations, Master Wei himself became an immortal. Casting off the harms of the age, he relied on mountains, transformed his form, and ascended as an immortal. Even a hundred generations later, he roams the human world, playing in the Three Realms, pointing to the mysterious gate, and delivering all beings. Has he not displayed his feathered wings, aiding others when convenient?\n\nHow is this different from Confucius’ Ten Wings of the *Yi*? Could Master Wei ever have forgotten the world for a day?\n\nMaster Wei’s intent lies in uniting the Three Things—eastern Wood, southern Fire, and western Metal—into one household, as in the previous chapter’s meaning of the Three Coming to Court. He enables people to seek coherence in the text.\n\nAfter attaining the Dao, one has a body outside the body. Like the auspicious person riding upon them, they are free in all directions. Though in Yao’s floods or Tang’s great droughts, with all things withering and seas turning to mulberry fields, their numinous essence rides the true gold Dharma-body, coming and going freely, entering and exiting without obstruction. This is true security and long life.\n\nThe cauldron’s body is one foot and five inches in circumference, symbolizing the Three and Five. Its circumference is fifteen, its diameter five inches. The Three and Five refer to: east Three, south Two (one Five); center Five, Two, Three; north One, west Four (Three Fives). Originally, the Great Ultimate (○) contains the wonder of the Three and Five, transforming the Five Phases into the Three and Five, and the Three and Five into One (○). The wonder of the golden elixir is fully contained here, hence the cauldron’s symbolism.",

The songs of the Perfected Lü once declared:\n*\"Gold and Azure, the Kinship of the Three—timeless,\nWondrous within wondrous, mysterious within mysterious.\"*\nGao Xiangxian’s poem likewise proclaimed:\n*\"Gold and Azure, Dragon and Tiger, the Kinship of the Three,\nLeft as the eternal sovereign of elixirs through the ages.\"*\nSuch praise is indeed the highest.\n\nIn the former Yue Prefecture, there once existed a commentary by Peng Zhenyi. I once obtained it and pored over it countless times, yet its language was abstruse and its meaning obscure, impossible to fathom. Among the rivers and lakes, those who study immortality all regarded this as a flaw, sighing only: *\"How profound is the Dao!\"*\n\nIn the year *jiachen* (1244), during the eleventh lunar month, by fortunate karmic connection, I encountered Master Baoyi, Chen Jun, in Dayun of Shanyin. The following summer, on the full moon of the fifth month, I met him again at the Yousheng Abbey in his residence. The Master then said to me: *\"If you are devoted to the Dao, you should further establish merit for it. Once, at the request of a friend, I composed a commentary on the* Cantong Qi*. The words therein directly reveal the secrets of the elixir, leaving no hidden mechanisms. My intent was to open the path for later learners, preventing them from stumbling in darkness, and I dared not employ the cryptic language of ancient texts. If you could arrange for its transmission, would that not be a great act of goodness?\"*\n\nHaving received the book, I read it by lamplight in quietude, and the mysteries of the profound became luminously clear before my eyes. Not only was the original intent of Master Wei’s text vividly illuminated, but even those secrets guarded by all the scriptures—never before dared to be spoken—were here laid bare. Raising my hands in praise, I declared: *\"My Master is the very embodiment of utmost compassion, and this book is the guiding compass for all who read the* Cantong Qi*.\"*\n\nWith reverence, I gathered those of karmic affinity to carve it into woodblocks, hoping that through successive transmission and mutual exchange, all of like mind might peruse it. Through its words, they may awaken to understanding and swiftly ascend to the true mystery. Yet should there remain those unable to fully grasp its profound subtleties, awaiting the personal instruction of a teacher, they may still stray into heterodox paths, deviant arts, or speculative theories that seem correct but are in truth false—such is the source of confusion and delusion.\n\nTo later readers, I earnestly urge: proceed with care.\n\n*Chunyu* (1245), mid-autumn, the first day of the month.\n*Disciple Tiantai Sheng bows and respectfully inscribes.*\n\n*Postscript*",

      "translated_text": "I have often heard the poem by the eminent scholar Gao Xiangxian:\n\n*\"Golden Splendor, Dragon-Tiger, the* Cantong Qi*,\nLeft as the eternal sovereign of the elixir’s realm.\"*\n\nFrom ancient times to the present, immortals have revered the *Cantong Qi* as the progenitor of all elixir methods. Long ago, there existed the *Scripture of Golden Splendor and Dragon-Tiger*, its words few but its meaning profound—so abstruse that none could fathom it. Then, in the Han dynasty, Master Wei Boyang of Shangyu in Yue unfolded its teachings into the *Cantong Qi*. Today, the public archives of Yue still circulate it, though only Peng Xiao’s commentary is deemed a fine edition. Yet with the passage of eras and the vicissitudes of time, what now circulates is no longer Peng’s authentic text. Only its preface and the *Bright Mirror Diagram* preserve Master Wei’s original intent; as for the various other commentaries, they all graft heterodox paths onto the true teaching. Thus, Zhang Pingshu lamented that later generations would recklessly annotate the immortal classics—such is indeed the case.\n\nMaster Baoyi, Chen Jun, traveled from Huai to Zhe, and scholars questioned him on the authenticity of this text. For in this world, those who delight in the strange may dismiss the *Cantong Qi* as a forgery, much as they do with the present-day *Yi of the Cassock*. My teacher served Master Baoyi the longest and personally heard his profound discourses: Master Wei styled himself Boyang, but in truth, he was the incarnate transformation of the Old Master (Laozi). The *Cantong Qi*’s diction is archaic, yet it fully expounds the true mechanism—indeed, it is Master Wei’s own words, beyond what any ordinary person could compose. It is like the *Yi of the Cassock*, which is in fact Chen Xiyi’s record of the Cassock Master’s teachings, not something a mundane Confucian could articulate. Yet some falsely claim it as their own work, misleading later generations—this is to covet Heaven’s merit, and how could they not incur Heaven’s wrath?\n\nUpon hearing these words, my heart melted and my doubts dissolved. I entreated Master Baoyi to annotate the text, but he was indifferent to worldly affairs and could not be troubled by brush and ink. Thus, I occasionally presented him with one or two passages, seeking elucidation of their intent. Over the years, the full commentary was at last completed. With reverence, I commissioned woodblock carvers to transmit it to those of like mind.\n\nAh! The *Scripture of Golden Splendor* awaited the *Cantong Qi* to be revealed, and the *Cantong Qi* awaited Master Baoyi’s explication to be illuminated—just as the *Spring and Autumn Annals* had the *Zuo Commentary*, and then awaited Du Yu’s annotations. Heaven, in its compassion for those who cultivate the Dao, brought forth this master in our age to unveil the secret mysteries of the elixir scriptures. Scholars must guard and transmit these teachings with care, lest they incur the reproach of frivolous disclosure or negligent profanation. I offer this solemn prayer.\n\n*First day of the first month, the inaugural year of the Duanping era (1234).*\n*Xiweizi Wang Yi, burning incense and bowing twice, pledges with a sincere heart.*\n\n*Colophon to the* Zhouyi Cantong Qi Jie*, Scroll Three.*",
