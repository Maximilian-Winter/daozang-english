  "full_translation": "**The Wondrous Scripture of the Three-Five Transformations from the Supreme Perfection of the Eightfold Simplicities of the Cavern-Truth**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Wondrous Scripture of the Three-Five Transformations from the Supreme Perfection of the Eightfold Simplicities of the Cavern-Truth*\n*Author unknown, approximately composed during the Eastern Jin or Liu-Song dynasties. Originally part of the* Eightfold Simplicities Scripture Instructions*, later circulated as an independent text. One scroll.*\n\n**Source:** *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Orthodox Section, Part One.\n\n---\n\nThe Four Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate inquired of the Most High Lord of the Great Dao, saying: \"To ingest the essence of the sun and moon, to hasten toward the wondrousness of the Two Luminaries—this most wondrous treasure, the highest of treasures—descends to give birth to the divine elixir. The Threefold Union completes its virtue; we have reverently received your command. Does the Dao suffice to end here?\"\n\nThe Most High replied: \"Excellent is this essential question, for it benefits all beings. All who attain the Dao do so through the accumulation of goodness. Within this, the arts and methods both inwardly and outwardly assist in its completion. Exhalation and inhalation, ingestion and absorption—these are all arts and methods. The Three Wisdoms and Five Insights—these are all good deeds. If good deeds are not established, the arts and methods will lack efficacy; even if they prove efficacious, it will not endure, and in time, the body will surely perish.\n\nThe superior scholar of lofty talent first establishes good deeds, then pursues the arts and methods. The arts and methods are vast and innumerable, varying in refinement and coarseness, each dependent on its conditions. From coarse conditions to the most wondrous, the ultimate wondrousness lies in the Threefold Union—here, in the divine elixir of the sun and moon. If one desires swift results, one must practice the myriad good deeds. Yet the myriad good deeds cannot be performed all at once; even in practicing them, one may not grasp their essentials. The essentials lie in the Three and the Five. When the Three and Five are attained, the myriad good deeds naturally stand firm. Though their number may not be fully complete, within them one may cultivate the arts and methods.\n\nThe arts and methods and goodness must be practiced in both movement and stillness. Through long accumulation, in no more than nine years, one will surely attain spiritual penetrations and ascend as a perfected saint.\"\n\nThe Perfected bowed deeply and further inquired: \"May we hear of the essentials of the Three and Five?\"\n\nThe Most High replied: \"You may hear of them, but do not transmit them to the unworthy. The Three are the Wisdoms; the Five are the Insights. The Three Wisdoms are: knowing Heaven, knowing Earth, and knowing Humanity. To know Humanity is to model oneself on Earth—tranquility is its foundation. To know Earth is to model oneself on Heaven—harmony and compliance are its basis. To know Heaven is to model oneself on the Dao—movement does not burden stillness. Stillness abides in profound clarity; movement responds to benefit all things. Benefiting all without seeking a name, without arrogance, without toil, without anxiety, without weariness, without refusal—this is clear and penetrating knowledge. When understanding is thus unobstructed and doubt-free, it aligns with the sun in virtue, hence it is called the Three Wisdoms. Wisdom is knowing. Knowing these Three Powers, one is capable of practicing the Dao. The Dao is penetration. Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust—the Five are not obstructed. When unobstructed, they penetrate; penetration brings boundless aid. Self and others mutually engender; the engendering of life is most urgent. Act swiftly without negligence, resolve doubts without hesitation—benefits will be inexhaustible, hence it is called the Five Insights.\n\nWhen the Five Insights unite with the Three Wisdoms, and the Three Wisdoms penetrate the Five Insights, insight and wisdom become boundless, wisdom and insight without limit. Forgetting stagnation, one attains penetration; attaining long life without death—this arises from the Three and Five. The myriad good deeds mutually complete one another, each with its scriptures, precepts, regulations, and dignified observances. The patterns of Heaven, the principles of Earth, and the order of Humanity are all distinct. Fathers teach sons, lords instruct ministers, masters instruct disciples, and the humble offer to the exalted. Without intent, words are forgotten; with intent, mutual benefit arises. Benefiting others without claiming merit—forgetting merit is the highest virtue. When virtue attains the supreme Dao, one constantly abides without loss. This is the ultimate for scholars, the ultimate of this ancestral source.\"\n\nThe Perfected again inquired: \"The most supreme and wondrous teaching—we now wish to proclaim and practice it. The superior transforms the inferior; the inferior reveres the superior. The proper relationship between master and disciple—scriptures and scrolls vary in order, some preceding, some following, some in the middle chapters, some in separate rituals, some transmitted as oral instructions. Across generations, families and nations differ; some are elaborate, some concise, and their application gives rise to many doubts. We dare not decide arbitrarily, hesitating and delaying, while daylight swiftly passes and moments are hard to retain. If cultivation deviates from the proper path, transgressions and faults increase. With no means to remedy this, we bow in shame and fear, reverently entrusting ourselves to the Heavenly Worthy. The Heavenly Worthy, in compassion, clearly reveals the essential teaching—we humbly beseech your precept.\"\n\nThe Most High replied: \"Learning must rely on a master; the master’s words are decisive. The various texts may be forgotten or differ in length, but how can their full intent be expressed? Now, to expound and transform for the benefit of all beings—all beings possess intent, and one should urgently encourage and guide them. I will now speak the essential instructions. Reflect carefully, adjust with the times, and do not turn away from the ancestral source.\"\n\nThe Perfected rejoiced, bowed deeply, and received the command.\n\nThe Most High said: \"The reason humanity is prized as equal to Heaven and Earth is that they can teach and guide one another. The first to awaken instructs those who awaken later, returning to flow back to the One Source. Abandoning suffering, one attains joy—this is prized and revered. Thus, those who attain the Dao and become immortals and perfected beings, even if they have not yet reached the great sagehood, later all arouse the mind and establish vows. Through karmic conditions and responsive manifestations, they are reborn among humans to praise and propagate the wondrous Dharma, accumulating virtue and piling up merit, thereby ascending to great sagehood.\n\nThe resources of great sagehood lie in practicing and teaching. Teaching and instruction must be strict and clear, governing the deviant with rectitude, and universally propagating the Four Immeasurables: compassion, joy, loving-kindness, and equanimity. Those who cannot do this, though they recite scriptures day and night, wear talismans, and ingest qi, labor much but gain little. If one wishes to accomplish the Great Vehicle, the Great Vehicle takes universal salvation as its priority. Universal salvation takes enlightenment and transformation as its urgency. Urgently teaching sentient beings to guard the One, preserve the Three, and practice the Five without obstruction—only then can one fully realize the Great Vehicle.\n\nThose of lesser understanding are unfit for the great method. For those of lesser capacity, one adapts and accords with them. Whether to act or conceal depends on the master; if the master is enlightened and without error, one should inwardly reflect with precision and not rashly proclaim it. Whether for oneself or others, one’s later self takes precedence over one’s present self. Unless one is a person of profound wisdom and penetrating insight, one should not speak of this Dao.\n\nWhen practicing transformation, first be sincere in what you have cultivated. If what you have cultivated proves efficacious, even if not yet perfected, it may roughly suffice to remedy urgent needs. Act swiftly when urgent; if you wait for perfection, merit will not advance. Seeking perfection has no end.\"\n\nSeeking perfection has its time—it lies in advancing together. Advance together, practice together, and verify together. If verification does not come at once, with time it will naturally manifest. When manifestations accumulate to fulfillment, fulfillment leads to attaining the Dao. Yet even in the utmost cultivation of the Dao, one cannot ascend immediately. Though immediate ascent is impossible, one should gradually practice and train.\n\nTrain in due season, act in accord with the turning of the times. If the times have not yet turned, do not force the season. To miss what is easily lost or to force the turning when it is waning brings labor and leads to harm. To act when the time is ripe and the turning is favorable brings ease and preserves wholeness. Those of complete virtue do not lose the proper time and turning. When time and turning are not aligned, superiors and inferiors grow suspicious, inner and outer energies become jealous, and yin and yang injure one another—this must not be rashly violated. To violate it invites deep trial; in hidden and manifest realms alike, one incurs fault that cannot be absolved. To avoid such calamity, discern carefully the turning of the times.\n\nThe four seasons and five phases follow one another without cease. Cultivate and practice in accord with the times, never slackening or retreating. When resonance arises and the turning unfolds, each has its proper method. The Three Caverns and all scriptures differ in their methods. When a turning flourishes, employ its method; when it wanes, set it aside. Do not treat them lightly or with disrespect; reverence and application must be balanced. Turnings have their times of action and concealment, but the Dao itself has no light or heavy weight.\n\nTransform the self, transform the household, transform the village, transform the state, transform the world. If the world does not accept it, do not violate it. State, village, household, and self all follow the same principle. If self-cultivation is not fitting, do not force it with suffering. Forced suffering leads to harm, retreat brings defeat and disaster, plunging one into hell and forever barring the gates of heaven. Even a human body may become unattainable—how then can one hope for immortality and perfection?\n\nThe learning of the perfected begins with self-examination. First practice what one has received; if it proves viable, proceed; if not, cease. Ceasing is not evil—reflect further on causes and conditions. If causes and conditions are not yet deep, advance slowly and secretly. If advancement proves viable, proceed; if not, cease again. Having repeatedly erred at the outset, one should feel shame and remorse, avoiding any display of retreat or speaking of it to others. Instead, silently and privately resume practice. For each matter, attempt it three times; if three attempts fail, change the method. Methods are countless—follow what one has received and put it into practice. Transform the self, then extend it to others. From one’s own body to the world, and beyond without end.\n\nWhen all under heaven are the same, practice this art in secret. This art refines the heart; as the heart refines, the substance transforms. As the substance transforms, the heart grows pure, and the attainment of perfection draws near. In all wondrous transformations, first transform the self. To transform the self, first set one’s resolve on the Dao.\n\nThe Dao resides in the heart. With the Dao stored in the heart, though the Dao itself is invisible, the heart must not be forgotten. One who does not forget the heart keeps the Dao firm and upright. With the upright Dao in the heart, the heart harbors no ulterior motives, and evil does not dare to intrude. This is called resolve. Resolve in the Dao is most steadfast and accomplishes all undertakings.\n\nHow does one strengthen oneself? Strength comes from great compassion. Cherish all things as one’s own self. Do not harm others, and others will not harm you. All that contains qi—trees, grasses, soil, ashes—treat as your own body, cherish them as your children. Do not harbor thoughts of disdain or intentions to injure. Keep them constantly in mind, preserving them as you would yourself. Those with awareness, wish for them to advance in the Dao; those without awareness, wish for them to gain it. This accords with the virtue of heaven and precedes all goodness. With long practice, one becomes radiant and luminous, shining as brightly as the sun and moon.\n\nIn all wondrous transformations, first transform the self. To transform the self, first set one’s resolve on the Dao. Once resolved on the Dao, next guard virtue. Virtue resides in awareness. Within awareness dwells spirit; when spirit and awareness are devoted to the Dao, guarding virtue perfects the real. What the perfected practice is to cultivate goodness without forgetting, to recall it without omission—this is called awareness. Awareness of goodness and practice of compassion begin with each new life. Next, employ frugality and caution. Be as cautious at the end as at the beginning, without failure or杂乱. This is called a perfected person.\n\nBe meticulous and unceasing, moving the body in hidden stillness. When acting, respond to the moment; when the moment passes, withdraw, not clinging to things. Neither sound nor color can defile, neither toil nor humiliation can burden. In times of wealth and honor, do not accumulate, do not grow arrogant, do not be haughty or extravagant, do not be ostentatious or dazzling. In days of poverty and lowliness, do not flatter or fawn, do not feign or steal, do not murmur or complain. Maintain constancy within, take the mean in generosity or frugality. Conceal your light and spread substance, uphold integrity with reverence. Integrity brings honorable reward; substance and light attract the fruit of the Cavern Real. Unceasing practice of frugality aligns one’s virtue with the sun and moon.\n\nIn all wondrous transformations, first transform the self. To transform the self, first set one’s resolve on the Dao, next guard virtue, and finally practice humility. Humility is knowing, yielding, and abiding. The spirit of awareness knows the Dao and knows virtue. The Dao is revered, virtue is noble—they cannot be sought rashly. Seek them through humility, nurturing the self with lowliness. When rank and power are before you, withdraw and remain behind. Follow in proper order, never coveting what lies ahead. Always remain among the lowest, abiding in the most abject places, where others do not compete and the world does not strive. Rest there without frustration, and resolve in the Dao grows stronger, guarding virtue ever more firmly.\n\nAll beings submit to you, and what the common cannot do, you alone accomplish. Rising above the multitude, you win the compassion of the divine and the protection of the true. Descending low, you ascend high; from earth you mount to heaven. Leaving the mortal, you enter the sacred, becoming the source of great wisdom, revered by all, looked up to by heaven and humanity. Through yielding the self, you save others and attain ability. Remaining behind, you advance to the fore; humility brings greater gain. Without stillness, you become the most eminent; without daring to be first, you become the foremost. From this, you surpass others, becoming the most honored among people, equal to heaven and earth, ascending at dawn like the sun. You reach the utmost of the stars and the reality of the Three Wisdoms. This reality lies in compassion and frugality, in not daring to be first—the subtlety of wisdom.\n\nIn all wondrous transformations, first transform the self. To transform the self, practice the Three Wisdoms. Once the Three Wisdoms are mastered, follow the Five Virtues. The Five Virtues are benevolence, propriety, trust, righteousness, and wisdom. The Three Wisdoms of the Caverns encompass the Five Virtues; the wisdom within the Five Virtues is the Three Wisdoms. Before learning is complete, the Three Wisdoms do not encompass one another; before practice is thorough, the Five Virtues do not unite as one.\n\nThus, though names are established differently, the Three and Five form distinct categories. Yet within the Five Virtues, wisdom is not yet perfected—perfection lies in the Three becoming one, and once unified, the Five no longer exist as such. Benevolence, propriety, trust, and righteousness each contain a portion of wisdom; this portion resides in the four, and through it, the four are completed. Without this wisdom, they cannot stand. Since the four possess but a fraction, they do not bear the name of wisdom; when wisdom’s portion is abundant, it joins the four virtues to form the Five. When the Five Virtues interpenetrate, they become balanced and impartial. Impartiality dissolves the names of the Five, and once names dissolve, they merge with the Three Wisdoms as one. When the Three Wisdoms first unite, this unity extends to the Five, and is called the Six Penetrations. After thorough penetration, the Three vanish. When the Three and Five harmonize, it is called the Seven Awakenings. Awakening is clear and boundless, ultimately without limit. Whether numbered or unnumbered, it is luminous and unobstructed—divided, it divides; united, it unites. Union does not burden division, nor does division burden union. United, it is collectively called the One; divided, it is briefly named the Seven.\n\nThe Seven Stages guide the beginner back to the source:\nThe first is the arising of knowing in the spirit of consciousness;\nThe second is seeing through knowing;\nThe third is following what is seen;\nThe fourth is practicing what is followed;\nThe fifth is steadfastness in practice;\nThe sixth is accomplishment in steadfastness;\nThe seventh is non-abiding in accomplishment.\n\nThe Seven Awakenings and Seven Stages arise from a single awakening. Awakening has depths and shallows, ordered into seven. Beyond this lies the thorough penetration into the source of the Dao. The eightfold attainment is infinite, beyond words and speech. Speech cannot exhaust it; silent realization understands itself. In silent self-understanding, words are forgotten. Forgetting words, one attains the Dao—this is the highest Dao.\n\nIn all wondrous transformations, first transform the self. To transform the self, follow the Five Virtues:\n**Benevolence** delights in life and detests killing, rescues the failing and protects the accomplished, forbids harm and injury, severs jealousy and envy. It harmonizes yin and yang, releases life and delivers from death, cherishes compassion and kindness, never forgetting for a moment. Accumulating benevolence prolongs life, leading to ascension as an immortal. What immortals value is mutual generation—unceasing growth, hidden and manifest transmission. Transmission is carried by qi, and qi has its names.\n\nBenevolence governs Wood; Wood generates Fire, and Fire is **Propriety**. Propriety is reverence within and without, bowing with proper form, honoring the Three Honored Ones, valuing nurture and harmony. It forbids arrogance and pride, cuts off greed and lust, and cultivates purity, integrity, and chastity. With time, one becomes an immortal.\n\nFire generates Earth, and Earth is **Trust**. Trust is inner sincerity without falsehood, vows without betrayal. It forbids deceit and fraud; those who deceive within are punished. It aligns heart and speech, inspires confidence and verification, and embodies sincerity and honesty. With time, one becomes an immortal.\n\nEarth generates Metal, and Metal is **Righteousness**. Righteousness clearly distinguishes right and wrong, rewards good and punishes evil, removes perversity and adheres to correctness, resolves doubts and settles suspicions. It forsakes theft and does not covet wealth, restrains the fierce and aids the weak. It forbids delusion, perverse views, and doubt, as well as arrogance, self-importance, and the theft of public or private goods. It promotes blessings and averts misfortune, governs chaos and halts violence, upholds simplicity and generosity. With time, one becomes an immortal.\n\nMetal generates Water, and Water is **Wisdom**. Wisdom knows all things clearly, discerns truth from falsehood. It forbids deceit, folly, and obstinacy, and cultivates clarity, balance, and thorough penetration. It studies diligently and teaches others, guiding without weariness. With time, one becomes an immortal.\n\nWhen the Five Virtues are uneven, there is merit and fault, progress and regression, each compensating for the other. Excessive good brings fortune; excessive evil brings misfortune. Misfortune and fortune have no fixed gate—only humans summon them. When summoning is not single-minded, good and evil interchange. Though fortune may reach heaven, there is still regression; though misfortune may enter hell, there is still ascension. These are not companions of Dao-learning, but merely followers of common custom—superficially believing, yet unable to attain the real.\n\nThe way of true immortality is entrusted to those of superior aspiration. Those of superior aspiration all love learning the true immortality, diligently practicing the Three Wisdoms and refining the Five Virtues. When the Three Wisdoms are practiced equally without bias or attachment, and accumulated over time to full penetration, one ascends to the rank of highest sage, uniting with the Dao in truth. Transmission is mutual, but one must find the right person. Learning without understanding the Three and Five is merely self-inflicted toil. The wise keep this secret, practicing it in silence without divulgence.\n\nIn all wondrous transformations, first transform the self. To transform the self, first receive the method. Receiving the method without purification, or transmitting it carelessly; purifying without precision, or lacking proper offerings; coercing through power, or disobeying the master’s teachings; obtaining it by chance without seeking a clear teacher; failing to cleanse the sacred covenant or present offerings; beginning practice only to abandon it; harboring doubts and slandering it openly, uttering foul words and committing myriad defilements; keeping it secret without understanding, lacking the will to study; making offerings contrary to the rules, placing things improperly; treating sacred texts lightly, casually assuming possession; seizing or begging, stealing glances and acting recklessly—those who commit these transgressions face the relentless blades of the wind. They must urgently repent, purify their hearts and wash their intestines, surrender their lives to the Azure Youth, bow in confession of faults, and persist for three years. Only then will their sins be absolved. If they do not repeat their offenses, they may proceed with the scriptures.\n\nIf their destiny is not yet aligned, it is because their merit and virtue are insufficient. They should solely invoke the Azure Youth to open their minds, untie the knots of misfortune, and bestow the clarity of thorough penetration. This enables them to fully comprehend the profound meaning, naturally illuminate their causes and conditions, accelerate their practice, and swiftly attain the rank of highest perfected one.\n\n**Method of Invoking the Azure Youth Lord:**\nIn the Eastern Sea, on the mountain of Fangzhu, originally named the Eastern Mound Eastern Florescence Palace, it spans three thousand *li* with six gates. The Eastern Gate is called the Azure Florescence Gate, guarded by Gatekeeper Li, styled Boyuan, who oversees the records of those studying immortality. The Southern Gate is called the Divine Florescence Jade Gate, guarded by Gatekeeper Wang, styled Zusi, who oversees the entry and exit of perfected ones and flying immortals.\n\nThe Western Gate is named the Jade Grotto Gate, guarded by Gatekeeper Kang, styled Shangjie, who oversees the entry and exit of the Most High Assembly of Perfected Ones, the Jade Emperor, the Thirty-Nine Emperors, the Twenty-Four Jade Perfected, and the Queen Mother of the Western Tortoise. The Northern Gate is named the Jade Yin Gate, guarded by Gatekeeper Shi, styled Shaoye, who oversees the records of perfected immortals and beginning students, as well as those demoted or degraded. The Southeast Gate is named the Celestial Pass Gate, guarded by Gatekeeper Wen, styled Wuche, who oversees the ledgers of past-life causes and conditions and the origins of those who attain immortality. The Northeast Gate is named the Gate of Frigid Waters, guarded by Gatekeeper Zhong, styled Lindu, who oversees the records of ghostly spirits and their reordering.\n\nThe six gates govern the Eastern Mound of Heaven. At each mountain gate stand three hundred lions and giant beasts, with three thousand guardian generals protecting each gate. Those who study the Dao must first know the names and order of the gates; those who do shall not die, and their names shall be reported to the Azure Palace. Upon entering the chamber to burn incense, one must constantly visualize the names of the gates and the names and styles of their gatekeepers. After nine years, one may ascend upon clouds and enter through the six gates.\n\nWithin the six gates lie three palaces. The first is named the Azure Palace of Fangzhu, governed by the Azure Youth Lord. The second is named the Azure Palace of Jade Preservation, governed by the Grand Marshal Gao Chenshi. The third is named the Azure Palace of Jade Florescence, governed by the Azure Florescence Youth of the Eastern Sea.\n\nWithin these three palaces stand hundreds of jade trees, upon which perch *kunjis*, phoenixes, and nine-colored birds. Below grow lingzhi mushrooms and jade wells with self-flowing springs; drinking from them grants a lifespan equal to the Three Luminaries. Lions and celestial beasts guard the outer walls.\n\nFor those whose Daoist practice remains unfulfilled, it is due to the obstruction of transgressions. One must purify oneself, burn incense, repent of sins, and pray for blessings. On a *dingmao* day, go to an open space—if it rains, remain indoors—focus the mind toward the east, knock the teeth three times, close the eyes, and visualize the three palaces. Envision the Azure Youth Lord, the High Minister, within the Azure Palace of Fangzhu, inside a golden hall and jade chambers, surrounded by three thousand perfected attendants and maidens, his divine radiance and numinous brilliance self-illuminating, azure mist shading above, and purple clouds swirling around. In the northern hall of the palace stands a jade lattice, upon which rests the ledger of those studying immortality, recording their mystical names and the year and month of their entry. Golden slips and jade tablets number one hundred thousand, overseen by the Immortal Clerk.\n\nVisualize one’s name inscribed therein, and concentrate intently for a long while. Then behold the Azure Youth Lord, his form and countenance resplendent, radiant, and dazzling. With a steadfast heart and hands clasped, state one’s rank and name, and sincerely pledge devotion to the Azure Youth Lord, the High Minister. Then bow three times. After bowing, prostrate oneself and knock the head to the ground three times in secret, whispering: *\"I beseech the forgiveness of this humble student, [name], for past and present grave transgressions. Open my heart and awaken my mind, that I may comprehend the profound scriptures, recognize my past lives, swiftly attain immortality, bring prosperity to my family, and spread virtue and the Dao.\"*\n\nAfterward, bow three more times and knock the head three times. Alternatively, one may face north and perform this ritual once every sixty days. As for visualization, it should always reside in the heart. If a *dingmao* day cannot be observed, any *mao* day may be used. If performing the ritual every sixty days is not possible, it may be done once per season. Those who undertake this practice must not allow sins to accumulate unchecked; without sincerity and reform, effort is wasted and faults only multiply. One who performs this repentance once a year with true devotion surpasses those who do so frequently but superficially.\n\nIf not performing the ritual every sixty days, one must complete one ritual with three hundred sixty bows, up to a total of three thousand six hundred bows. If the body is not overly fatigued, one may perform this in a single day and night across twelve hours, bowing three hundred times per hour to reach three thousand six hundred. After the ritual, reflect on one’s transgressions and reform, never repeating them, and persist in virtuous conduct without pause. After three years of this, the Three Honored Ones shall manifest.\n\nHere ends the *Wondrous Formula of the Three-Five Transformations* from the *Supreme Perfected Scripture of the Eight Pure Ones of the Cavernous Truth*.",

If good deeds are not established, the arts and methods will lack efficacy; even if they prove efficacious, it will not endure, and in time, the body will surely perish.\n\nThe superior scholar of lofty talent first establishes good deeds, then pursues the arts and methods. The arts and methods are vast and innumerable, varying in refinement and coarseness, each dependent on its conditions. From coarse conditions to the most wondrous, the ultimate wondrousness lies in the Threefold Union—here, in the divine elixir of the sun and moon. If one desires swift results, one must practice the myriad good deeds. Yet the myriad good deeds cannot be performed all at once; even in practicing them, one may not grasp their essentials. The essentials lie in the Three and the Five. When the Three and Five are attained, the myriad good deeds naturally stand firm. Though their number may not be fully complete, within them one may cultivate the arts and methods.\n\nThe arts and methods and goodness must be practiced in both movement and stillness. Through long accumulation, in no more than nine years, one will surely attain spiritual penetrations and ascend as a perfected saint.\"\n\nThe Perfected bowed deeply and further inquired: \"May we hear of the essentials of the Three and Five?\"\n\nThe Most High replied: \"You may hear of them, but do not transmit them to the unworthy. The Three are the Wisdoms; the Five are the Insights. The Three Wisdoms are: knowing Heaven, knowing Earth, and knowing Humanity. To know Humanity is to model oneself on Earth—tranquility is its foundation. To know Earth is to model oneself on Heaven—harmony and compliance are its basis. To know Heaven is to model oneself on the Dao—movement does not burden stillness. Stillness abides in profound clarity; movement responds to benefit all things. Benefiting all without seeking a name, without arrogance, without toil, without anxiety, without weariness, without refusal—this is clear and penetrating knowledge. When understanding is thus unobstructed and doubt-free, it aligns with the sun in virtue, hence it is called the Three Wisdoms. Wisdom is knowing. Knowing these Three Powers, one is capable of practicing the Dao. The Dao is penetration. Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust—the Five are not obstructed. When unobstructed, they penetrate; penetration brings boundless aid. Self and others mutually engender; the engendering of life is most urgent. Act swiftly without negligence, resolve doubts without hesitation—benefits will be inexhaustible, hence it is called the Five Insights.\n\nWhen the Five Insights unite with the Three Wisdoms, and the Three Wisdoms penetrate the Five Insights, insight and wisdom become boundless, wisdom and insight without limit. Forgetting stagnation, one attains penetration; attaining long life without death—this arises from the Three and Five. The myriad good deeds mutually complete one another, each with its scriptures, precepts, regulations, and dignified observances. The patterns of Heaven, the principles of Earth, and the order of Humanity are all distinct. Fathers teach sons, lords instruct ministers, masters instruct disciples, and the humble offer to the exalted. Without intent, words are forgotten; with intent, mutual benefit arises. Benefiting others without claiming merit—forgetting merit is the highest virtue. When virtue attains the supreme Dao, one constantly abides without loss. This is the ultimate for scholars, the ultimate of this ancestral source.\"\n\nThe Perfected again inquired: \"The most supreme and wondrous teaching—we now wish to proclaim and practice it. The superior transforms the inferior; the inferior reveres the superior. The proper relationship between master and disciple—scriptures and scrolls vary in order, some preceding, some following, some in the middle chapters, some in separate rituals, some transmitted as oral instructions. Across generations, families and nations differ; some are elaborate, some concise, and their application gives rise to many doubts. We dare not decide arbitrarily, hesitating and delaying, while daylight swiftly passes and moments are hard to retain. If cultivation deviates from the proper path, transgressions and faults increase. With no means to remedy this, we bow in shame and fear, reverently entrusting ourselves to the Heavenly Worthy. The Heavenly Worthy, in compassion, clearly reveals the essential teaching—we humbly beseech your precept.\"\n\nThe Most High replied: \"Learning must rely on a master; the master’s words are decisive. The various texts may be forgotten or differ in length, but how can their full intent be expressed? Now, to expound and transform for the benefit of all beings—all beings possess intent, and one should urgently encourage and guide them. I will now speak the essential instructions. Reflect carefully, adjust with the times, and do not turn away from the ancestral source.\"\n\nThe Perfected rejoiced, bowed deeply, and received the command.\n\nThe Most High said: \"The reason humanity is prized as equal to Heaven and Earth is that they can teach and guide one another. The first to awaken instructs those who awaken later, returning to flow back to the One Source. Abandoning suffering, one attains joy—this is prized and revered. Thus, those who attain the Dao and become immortals and perfected beings, even if they have not yet reached the great sagehood, later all arouse the mind and establish vows. Through karmic conditions and responsive manifestations, they are reborn among humans to praise and propagate the wondrous Dharma, accumulating virtue and piling up merit, thereby ascending to great sagehood.\n\nThe resources of great sagehood lie in practicing and teaching. Teaching and instruction must be strict and clear, governing the deviant with rectitude, and universally propagating the Four Immeasurables: compassion, joy, loving-kindness, and equanimity. Those who cannot do this, though they recite scriptures day and night, wear talismans, and ingest qi, labor much but gain little. If one wishes to accomplish the Great Vehicle, the Great Vehicle takes universal salvation as its priority. Universal salvation takes enlightenment and transformation as its urgency. Urgently teaching sentient beings to guard the One, preserve the Three, and practice the Five without obstruction—only then can one fully realize the Great Vehicle.\n\nThose of lesser understanding are unfit for the great method. For those of lesser capacity, one adapts and accords with them. Whether to act or conceal depends on the master; if the master is enlightened and without error, one should inwardly reflect with precision and not rashly proclaim it. Whether for oneself or others, one’s later self takes precedence over one’s present self. Unless one is a person of profound wisdom and penetrating insight, one should not speak of this Dao.\n\nWhen practicing transformation, first be sincere in what you have cultivated. If what you have cultivated proves efficacious, even if not yet perfected, it may roughly suffice to remedy urgent needs. Act swiftly when urgent; if you wait for perfection, merit will not advance. Seeking perfection has no end.\"",

      "translated_text": "Seeking perfection has its time—it lies in advancing together. Advance together, practice together, and verify together. If verification does not come at once, with time it will naturally manifest. When manifestations accumulate to fulfillment, fulfillment leads to attaining the Dao. Yet even in the utmost cultivation of the Dao, one cannot ascend immediately. Though immediate ascent is impossible, one should gradually practice and train.\n\nTrain in due season, act in accord with the turning of the times. If the times have not yet turned, do not force the season. To miss what is easily lost or to force the turning when it is waning brings labor and leads to harm. To act when the time is ripe and the turning is favorable brings ease and preserves wholeness. Those of complete virtue do not lose the proper time and turning. When time and turning are not aligned, superiors and inferiors grow suspicious, inner and outer energies become jealous, and yin and yang injure one another—this must not be rashly violated. To violate it invites deep trial; in hidden and manifest realms alike, one incurs fault that cannot be absolved. To avoid such calamity, discern carefully the turning of the times.\n\nThe four seasons and five phases follow one another without cease. Cultivate and practice in accord with the times, never slackening or retreating. When resonance arises and the turning unfolds, each has its proper method. The Three Caverns and all scriptures differ in their methods. When a turning flourishes, employ its method; when it wanes, set it aside. Do not treat them lightly or with disrespect; reverence and application must be balanced. Turnings have their times of action and concealment, but the Dao itself has no light or heavy weight.\n\nTransform the self, transform the household, transform the village, transform the state, transform the world. If the world does not accept it, do not violate it. State, village, household, and self all follow the same principle. If self-cultivation is not fitting, do not force it with suffering. Forced suffering leads to harm, retreat brings defeat and disaster, plunging one into hell and forever barring the gates of heaven. Even a human body may become unattainable—how then can one hope for immortality and perfection?\n\nThe learning of the perfected begins with self-examination. First practice what one has received; if it proves viable, proceed; if not, cease. Ceasing is not evil—reflect further on causes and conditions. If causes and conditions are not yet deep, advance slowly and secretly. If advancement proves viable, proceed; if not, cease again. Having repeatedly erred at the outset, one should feel shame and remorse, avoiding any display of retreat or speaking of it to others. Instead, silently and privately resume practice. For each matter, attempt it three times; if three attempts fail, change the method. Methods are countless—follow what one has received and put it into practice. Transform the self, then extend it to others. From one’s own body to the world, and beyond without end.\n\nWhen all under heaven are the same, practice this art in secret. This art refines the heart; as the heart refines, the substance transforms. As the substance transforms, the heart grows pure, and the attainment of perfection draws near. In all wondrous transformations, first transform the self. To transform the self, first set one’s resolve on the Dao.\n\nThe Dao resides in the heart. With the Dao stored in the heart, though the Dao itself is invisible, the heart must not be forgotten. One who does not forget the heart keeps the Dao firm and upright. With the upright Dao in the heart, the heart harbors no ulterior motives, and evil does not dare to intrude. This is called resolve. Resolve in the Dao is most steadfast and accomplishes all undertakings.\n\nHow does one strengthen oneself? Strength comes from great compassion. Cherish all things as one’s own self. Do not harm others, and others will not harm you. All that contains qi—trees, grasses, soil, ashes—treat as your own body, cherish them as your children. Do not harbor thoughts of disdain or intentions to injure. Keep them constantly in mind, preserving them as you would yourself. Those with awareness, wish for them to advance in the Dao; those without awareness, wish for them to gain it. This accords with the virtue of heaven and precedes all goodness. With long practice, one becomes radiant and luminous, shining as brightly as the sun and moon.\n\nIn all wondrous transformations, first transform the self. To transform the self, first set one’s resolve on the Dao. Once resolved on the Dao, next guard virtue. Virtue resides in awareness. Within awareness dwells spirit; when spirit and awareness are devoted to the Dao, guarding virtue perfects the real. What the perfected practice is to cultivate goodness without forgetting, to recall it without omission—this is called awareness. Awareness of goodness and practice of compassion begin with each new life. Next, employ frugality and caution. Be as cautious at the end as at the beginning, without failure or杂乱. This is called a perfected person.\n\nBe meticulous and unceasing, moving the body in hidden stillness. When acting, respond to the moment; when the moment passes, withdraw, not clinging to things. Neither sound nor color can defile, neither toil nor humiliation can burden. In times of wealth and honor, do not accumulate, do not grow arrogant, do not be haughty or extravagant, do not be ostentatious or dazzling. In days of poverty and lowliness, do not flatter or fawn, do not feign or steal, do not murmur or complain. Maintain constancy within, take the mean in generosity or frugality. Conceal your light and spread substance, uphold integrity with reverence. Integrity brings honorable reward; substance and light attract the fruit of the Cavern Real. Unceasing practice of frugality aligns one’s virtue with the sun and moon.\n\nIn all wondrous transformations, first transform the self. To transform the self, first set one’s resolve on the Dao, next guard virtue, and finally practice humility. Humility is knowing, yielding, and abiding. The spirit of awareness knows the Dao and knows virtue. The Dao is revered, virtue is noble—they cannot be sought rashly. Seek them through humility, nurturing the self with lowliness. When rank and power are before you, withdraw and remain behind. Follow in proper order, never coveting what lies ahead. Always remain among the lowest, abiding in the most abject places, where others do not compete and the world does not strive. Rest there without frustration, and resolve in the Dao grows stronger, guarding virtue ever more firmly.\n\nAll beings submit to you, and what the common cannot do, you alone accomplish. Rising above the multitude, you win the compassion of the divine and the protection of the true. Descending low, you ascend high; from earth you mount to heaven. Leaving the mortal, you enter the sacred, becoming the source of great wisdom, revered by all, looked up to by heaven and humanity. Through yielding the self, you save others and attain ability. Remaining behind, you advance to the fore; humility brings greater gain. Without stillness, you become the most eminent; without daring to be first, you become the foremost. From this, you surpass others, becoming the most honored among people, equal to heaven and earth, ascending at dawn like the sun. You reach the utmost of the stars and the reality of the Three Wisdoms. This reality lies in compassion and frugality, in not daring to be first—the subtlety of wisdom.\n\nIn all wondrous transformations, first transform the self. To transform the self, practice the Three Wisdoms. Once the Three Wisdoms are mastered, follow the Five Virtues. The Five Virtues are benevolence, propriety, trust, righteousness, and wisdom. The Three Wisdoms of the Caverns encompass the Five Virtues; the wisdom within the Five Virtues is the Three Wisdoms. Before learning is complete, the Three Wisdoms do not encompass one another; before practice is thorough, the Five Virtues do not unite as one.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, though names are established differently, the Three and Five form distinct categories. Yet within the Five Virtues, wisdom is not yet perfected—perfection lies in the Three becoming one, and once unified, the Five no longer exist as such. Benevolence, propriety, trust, and righteousness each contain a portion of wisdom; this portion resides in the four, and through it, the four are completed. Without this wisdom, they cannot stand. Since the four possess but a fraction, they do not bear the name of wisdom; when wisdom’s portion is abundant, it joins the four virtues to form the Five. When the Five Virtues interpenetrate, they become balanced and impartial. Impartiality dissolves the names of the Five, and once names dissolve, they merge with the Three Wisdoms as one. When the Three Wisdoms first unite, this unity extends to the Five, and is called the Six Penetrations. After thorough penetration, the Three vanish. When the Three and Five harmonize, it is called the Seven Awakenings. Awakening is clear and boundless, ultimately without limit. Whether numbered or unnumbered, it is luminous and unobstructed—divided, it divides; united, it unites. Union does not burden division, nor does division burden union. United, it is collectively called the One; divided, it is briefly named the Seven.\n\nThe Seven Stages guide the beginner back to the source:\nThe first is the arising of knowing in the spirit of consciousness;\nThe second is seeing through knowing;\nThe third is following what is seen;\nThe fourth is practicing what is followed;\nThe fifth is steadfastness in practice;\nThe sixth is accomplishment in steadfastness;\nThe seventh is non-abiding in accomplishment.\n\nThe Seven Awakenings and Seven Stages arise from a single awakening. Awakening has depths and shallows, ordered into seven. Beyond this lies the thorough penetration into the source of the Dao. The eightfold attainment is infinite, beyond words and speech. Speech cannot exhaust it; silent realization understands itself. In silent self-understanding, words are forgotten. Forgetting words, one attains the Dao—this is the highest Dao.\n\nIn all wondrous transformations, first transform the self. To transform the self, follow the Five Virtues:\n**Benevolence** delights in life and detests killing, rescues the failing and protects the accomplished, forbids harm and injury, severs jealousy and envy. It harmonizes yin and yang, releases life and delivers from death, cherishes compassion and kindness, never forgetting for a moment. Accumulating benevolence prolongs life, leading to ascension as an immortal. What immortals value is mutual generation—unceasing growth, hidden and manifest transmission. Transmission is carried by qi, and qi has its names.\n\nBenevolence governs Wood; Wood generates Fire, and Fire is **Propriety**. Propriety is reverence within and without, bowing with proper form, honoring the Three Honored Ones, valuing nurture and harmony. It forbids arrogance and pride, cuts off greed and lust, and cultivates purity, integrity, and chastity. With time, one becomes an immortal.\n\nFire generates Earth, and Earth is **Trust**. Trust is inner sincerity without falsehood, vows without betrayal. It forbids deceit and fraud; those who deceive within are punished. It aligns heart and speech, inspires confidence and verification, and embodies sincerity and honesty. With time, one becomes an immortal.\n\nEarth generates Metal, and Metal is **Righteousness**. Righteousness clearly distinguishes right and wrong, rewards good and punishes evil, removes perversity and adheres to correctness, resolves doubts and settles suspicions. It forsakes theft and does not covet wealth, restrains the fierce and aids the weak. It forbids delusion, perverse views, and doubt, as well as arrogance, self-importance, and the theft of public or private goods. It promotes blessings and averts misfortune, governs chaos and halts violence, upholds simplicity and generosity. With time, one becomes an immortal.\n\nMetal generates Water, and Water is **Wisdom**. Wisdom knows all things clearly, discerns truth from falsehood. It forbids deceit, folly, and obstinacy, and cultivates clarity, balance, and thorough penetration. It studies diligently and teaches others, guiding without weariness. With time, one becomes an immortal.\n\nWhen the Five Virtues are uneven, there is merit and fault, progress and regression, each compensating for the other. Excessive good brings fortune; excessive evil brings misfortune. Misfortune and fortune have no fixed gate—only humans summon them. When summoning is not single-minded, good and evil interchange. Though fortune may reach heaven, there is still regression; though misfortune may enter hell, there is still ascension. These are not companions of Dao-learning, but merely followers of common custom—superficially believing, yet unable to attain the real.\n\nThe way of true immortality is entrusted to those of superior aspiration. Those of superior aspiration all love learning the true immortality, diligently practicing the Three Wisdoms and refining the Five Virtues. When the Three Wisdoms are practiced equally without bias or attachment, and accumulated over time to full penetration, one ascends to the rank of highest sage, uniting with the Dao in truth. Transmission is mutual, but one must find the right person. Learning without understanding the Three and Five is merely self-inflicted toil. The wise keep this secret, practicing it in silence without divulgence.\n\nIn all wondrous transformations, first transform the self. To transform the self, first receive the method. Receiving the method without purification, or transmitting it carelessly; purifying without precision, or lacking proper offerings; coercing through power, or disobeying the master’s teachings; obtaining it by chance without seeking a clear teacher; failing to cleanse the sacred covenant or present offerings; beginning practice only to abandon it; harboring doubts and slandering it openly, uttering foul words and committing myriad defilements; keeping it secret without understanding, lacking the will to study; making offerings contrary to the rules, placing things improperly; treating sacred texts lightly, casually assuming possession; seizing or begging, stealing glances and acting recklessly—those who commit these transgressions face the relentless blades of the wind. They must urgently repent, purify their hearts and wash their intestines, surrender their lives to the Azure Youth, bow in confession of faults, and persist for three years. Only then will their sins be absolved. If they do not repeat their offenses, they may proceed with the scriptures.\n\nIf their destiny is not yet aligned, it is because their merit and virtue are insufficient. They should solely invoke the Azure Youth to open their minds, untie the knots of misfortune, and bestow the clarity of thorough penetration. This enables them to fully comprehend the profound meaning, naturally illuminate their causes and conditions, accelerate their practice, and swiftly attain the rank of highest perfected one.\n\n**Method of Invoking the Azure Youth Lord:**\nIn the Eastern Sea, on the mountain of Fangzhu, originally named the Eastern Mound Eastern Florescence Palace, it spans three thousand *li* with six gates. The Eastern Gate is called the Azure Florescence Gate, guarded by Gatekeeper Li, styled Boyuan, who oversees the records of those studying immortality. The Southern Gate is called the Divine Florescence Jade Gate, guarded by Gatekeeper Wang, styled Zusi, who oversees the entry and exit of perfected ones and flying immortals.",

      "translated_text": "The Western Gate is named the Jade Grotto Gate, guarded by Gatekeeper Kang, styled Shangjie, who oversees the entry and exit of the Most High Assembly of Perfected Ones, the Jade Emperor, the Thirty-Nine Emperors, the Twenty-Four Jade Perfected, and the Queen Mother of the Western Tortoise. The Northern Gate is named the Jade Yin Gate, guarded by Gatekeeper Shi, styled Shaoye, who oversees the records of perfected immortals and beginning students, as well as those demoted or degraded. The Southeast Gate is named the Celestial Pass Gate, guarded by Gatekeeper Wen, styled Wuche, who oversees the ledgers of past-life causes and conditions and the origins of those who attain immortality. The Northeast Gate is named the Gate of Frigid Waters, guarded by Gatekeeper Zhong, styled Lindu, who oversees the records of ghostly spirits and their reordering.\n\nThe six gates govern the Eastern Mound of Heaven. At each mountain gate stand three hundred lions and giant beasts, with three thousand guardian generals protecting each gate. Those who study the Dao must first know the names and order of the gates; those who do shall not die, and their names shall be reported to the Azure Palace. Upon entering the chamber to burn incense, one must constantly visualize the names of the gates and the names and styles of their gatekeepers. After nine years, one may ascend upon clouds and enter through the six gates.\n\nWithin the six gates lie three palaces. The first is named the Azure Palace of Fangzhu, governed by the Azure Youth Lord. The second is named the Azure Palace of Jade Preservation, governed by the Grand Marshal Gao Chenshi. The third is named the Azure Palace of Jade Florescence, governed by the Azure Florescence Youth of the Eastern Sea.\n\nWithin these three palaces stand hundreds of jade trees, upon which perch *kunjis*, phoenixes, and nine-colored birds. Below grow lingzhi mushrooms and jade wells with self-flowing springs; drinking from them grants a lifespan equal to the Three Luminaries. Lions and celestial beasts guard the outer walls.\n\nFor those whose Daoist practice remains unfulfilled, it is due to the obstruction of transgressions. One must purify oneself, burn incense, repent of sins, and pray for blessings. On a *dingmao* day, go to an open space—if it rains, remain indoors—focus the mind toward the east, knock the teeth three times, close the eyes, and visualize the three palaces. Envision the Azure Youth Lord, the High Minister, within the Azure Palace of Fangzhu, inside a golden hall and jade chambers, surrounded by three thousand perfected attendants and maidens, his divine radiance and numinous brilliance self-illuminating, azure mist shading above, and purple clouds swirling around. In the northern hall of the palace stands a jade lattice, upon which rests the ledger of those studying immortality, recording their mystical names and the year and month of their entry. Golden slips and jade tablets number one hundred thousand, overseen by the Immortal Clerk.\n\nVisualize one’s name inscribed therein, and concentrate intently for a long while. Then behold the Azure Youth Lord, his form and countenance resplendent, radiant, and dazzling. With a steadfast heart and hands clasped, state one’s rank and name, and sincerely pledge devotion to the Azure Youth Lord, the High Minister. Then bow three times. After bowing, prostrate oneself and knock the head to the ground three times in secret, whispering: *\"I beseech the forgiveness of this humble student, [name], for past and present grave transgressions. Open my heart and awaken my mind, that I may comprehend the profound scriptures, recognize my past lives, swiftly attain immortality, bring prosperity to my family, and spread virtue and the Dao.\"*\n\nAfterward, bow three more times and knock the head three times. Alternatively, one may face north and perform this ritual once every sixty days. As for visualization, it should always reside in the heart. If a *dingmao* day cannot be observed, any *mao* day may be used. If performing the ritual every sixty days is not possible, it may be done once per season. Those who undertake this practice must not allow sins to accumulate unchecked; without sincerity and reform, effort is wasted and faults only multiply. One who performs this repentance once a year with true devotion surpasses those who do so frequently but superficially.\n\nIf not performing the ritual every sixty days, one must complete one ritual with three hundred sixty bows, up to a total of three thousand six hundred bows. If the body is not overly fatigued, one may perform this in a single day and night across twelve hours, bowing three hundred times per hour to reach three thousand six hundred. After the ritual, reflect on one’s transgressions and reform, never repeating them, and persist in virtuous conduct without pause. After three years of this, the Three Honored Ones shall manifest.\n\nHere ends the *Wondrous Formula of the Three-Five Transformations* from the *Supreme Perfected Scripture of the Eight Pure Ones of the Cavernous Truth*.",

The Southern Gate is called the Divine Florescence Jade Gate, guarded by Gatekeeper Wang, styled Zusi, who oversees the entry and exit of perfected ones and flying immortals.",
