  "full_translation": "**Hymn and Commentary on the Scripture of Constant Purity and Stillness Spoken by the Most High Lord Lao**\n\n*Title:* Hymn and Commentary on the Scripture of Constant Purity and Stillness Spoken by the Most High Lord Lao\n*Author:* Shenfeng Moranzi (Jin Dynasty Daoist Liu Tongwei)\n*One fascicle.*\n*Source text:* \"Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era,\" *Dongshen* section, *Hymns and Eulogies* category.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Hymn and Commentary on the Scripture of Constant Purity and Stillness Spoken by the Most High Lord Lao**\n\nWhen the source is pure, the stream is still, and the waves of the Dharma-sea settle;\nWhen the stem is firm and the root deep, it embraces the circulation of pure yang *qi*.\nWaxing and waning, ebb and flow—all under Heaven revolve in ceaseless motion.\nTracing the origins of Heaven and Earth’s portents, exploring the pivotal essence of yin and yang,\nMan entrusts his form to Heaven and Earth, returning to purity and stillness as his natural end;\nHe blends his *qi* with yin and yang, possessing the transformations of true constancy and change.\nPurity, though stirred, does not turn turbid;\nStillness, though disturbed, does not move.\nHeaven attains the One and is pure; Earth attains the One and is tranquil; Man attains the One and is numinous—this One is the Spirit.\nWhen the numinous source is profound and clear, the sagely Dao flows unimpeded;\nAbiding in quiescence, it responds and transforms without limit.\nStirred, it communicates without hindrance, endlessly generating and completing.\nHeaven and Earth possess this constant nature, pure and still without remainder;\nYet men and women lack this constant mind, lost in delusion and bound to attachments.\nWho can halt the turbid and gradually restore clarity? Only then may one attain it.\n\nThus, our Most High Lord, in his great compassion, expounded the *Scripture of Constant Purity and Stillness*,\nEstablishing teachings to guide the vulgar, aiding the upright and upholding the ancestral,\nStriving to transform the people and return them to the Root, enabling them to embrace the True and hold fast to the One.\nBy embodying the Mysterious Origin, refining the spirit to merge with the Dao,\nThey ascend as feathered immortals, soaring without error.\nThose who faithfully receive and practice its essential principles shall all attain resonance,\nFor none fail to achieve purity and stillness as the norm for all under Heaven—\nEven the myriad Perfected and Sages emerge from this alone.\n\n---\n\n**Hymn and Commentary on the Scripture of Constant Purity and Stillness Spoken by the Most High Lord Lao**\n\nThe Five Primes stand as the origin, the Void and Non-being the Dao’s spontaneity.\nThe Primordial Chaos wields the ancestral authority, its wondrous body aligning with the Mysterious Ancestor.\nExpounding the Teachings to illuminate the Supreme, knowing constancy through metaphorical elucidation.\nBy this pure and still virtue, the transformative teachings establish the scriptural canon.\n\nLord Lao said:\nThe Great Dao is formless, giving birth to Heaven and Earth;\nThe Great Dao conceals itself in form, its true essence merging in profound obscurity.\nThe Two Modes divide at the first sign, the One *qi* operates without cease.\nIts covering and bearing are truly unfathomable, nurturing and completing in perfect tranquility.\nLike a potter shaping vessels, all creatures, though dull, contain the numinous.\nThe Great Dao is without emotion, yet it moves the sun and moon;\nThe sun and moon traverse the void, shining brightly and impartially.\nThose who attain Heaven endure in illumination, adorning all things to universal communion.\nWith form, they bask in radiant warmth; without emotion, they merge with the fusion of images.\nYin and yang constantly embody the Dao, ceaselessly abiding in the Great Void.\n\nThe Great Dao is nameless, eternally nurturing the myriad things.\nThe wondrous Dao is truly hard to name, yet it encompasses the birth of all things.\nIn due time, it fills the earth’s veins; in trust, it endows Heaven’s clarity.\nBreathing forth the true ebb and flow, the harmonious Great Transformation is accomplished.\nCircular and penetrating, it returns to unity; high and low lie level and even.\nI know not its name, so I forcefully call it the Dao.\nWithout form, it is distant and traceless, beyond names within the primordial chaos.\nBefore the sprouting of Heaven, Earth, sun, or moon, how could there be rain, clouds, or wind?\nBreaking open the signs of the embryo, piercing through the obscurity of phenomena,\nBy this, creation is divided, and the authority of the boundless Dao is established.\n\nNow, the Dao possesses purity and turbidity, movement and stillness.\nPurity and turbidity are the *qi* of yin and yang, surging and flowing above and below.\nSpontaneously, they form transformations, ultimately aligning with perfect communion.\nThe myriad kinds contain nurturance, the Three Primes harmoniously unite.\nHeaven and Earth conjoin in supreme harmony, all converging in the One True Emptiness.\nHeaven is pure, Earth is turbid; Heaven moves, Earth is still.\nMan is pure, woman is turbid; man moves, woman is still.\nAt the inception, the Two Modes divide, and humanity, most numinous and noble, is honored.\nThe Three Powers stabilize the cosmos; the Two Things determine Heaven and Earth.\nAll kinds contain the true *qi*; the primordial is the gate of true reality.\nHard and soft complement each other in function—who can abide in embodying the Dao?\n\nDescending from the Root to the branches, it gives birth to the myriad things.\nFrom the Root, the true body is communicated; returning to the Origin, the causes of the branches are seen.\nSpring’s yang spreads luxuriant flourishing; autumn’s season governs withering decline.\nThe Supreme Ultimate generates form and transformation; pure harmony creates things anew.\nThe pivot of the Great Mechanism propels the great movement, entrusted to the workings of the divine.\nPurity is the source of turbidity; stillness is the foundation of movement.\nThe principle of purity and stillness is profound—who can fathom its depths?\nObserving emptiness, all realms are dispelled; severing appearances, all minds are enlightened.\nThe moon of wisdom flows through the cinnabar river; the clouds of compassion cover the emerald peaks.\nAbiding in quiescence, the spirit does not move; responding to things, it manifests as a knowing companion.\n\nWhen man can constantly abide in purity and stillness, Heaven and Earth all return to him.\nWhen man awakens to constant purity and stillness, he knows the wondrous sagely mechanism of the Source.\nIn the Great Beginning, there is no defilement or stagnation; in perfect quiescence, radiance is concealed.\nSilently, it enfolds the sand-realm; dimly, it penetrates the Purple Tenuity.\nAfter the Three Primes ascend and descend, Heaven and Earth all return to it.\n\nNow, man’s spirit delights in purity, yet his mind disturbs it; man’s mind delights in stillness, yet his desires drag it away.\nThe mind is the abode of the numinous—when the spirit dwells in stillness, it may rest.\nGluttony, anger, and delusion arise easily; discipline, concentration, and wisdom are hard to behold.\nThe profound essential lies in perfect correctness; steadfastly maintain inner leisure within leisure.\nConstantly free from the six desires, the Dharma-realm naturally expands.\n\nOne can constantly dispel desires, and the mind becomes still of itself; clarify the mind, and the spirit becomes pure of itself.\nIf one dispels all passions and desires, clarifying the mind, the wondrous insight of profound vision arises.\nUnited with the True, it is not objectified; returning to quiescence, it abandons all multiplicity.\nWaters stretch afar, merging with the stillness of Heaven; mountains stand tall, bearing the coldness of the moon.\nCircular and fused, wisdom is communicated; within the pot, the golden pellet revolves.\n\nNaturally, the six desires do not arise, and the three poisons are extinguished.\nRight mindfulness is without partiality, harmonizing with the Void and spontaneity.\nThe six sense-dusts instantly cease; the three poisons’ afflictions must be cured.\nThe wondrous Dao transcends kalpas of emptiness; the whole spirit ascends to the heavens above.\nIn these subtle and secret places, the Mysterious Female perpetuates itself.\n\nThose who cannot do so fail because the mind is not yet clarified and desires are not yet dispelled.\nLost on the path, they forsake their homeland, all due to obscuring their own radiance.\nThe mind, floating, is truly easily moved; familiar realms are hard to forget.\n\nWhen desire’s taint arises, how can it be dispelled?\nPerverse and cunning thoughts only lead one further astray.\nYet turning the head, one may awaken—\nIn self-reflection, the Empty King is seen.\n\nThose who can dispel it look inward at the mind,\nAnd find the mind is not the mind.\nAwakened to all sensory leaks,\nThe eye of Dao opens clearly.\n\nForm and sound are not obstacles;\nKnowledge and perception must be buried deep.\nWhen spirit is still, a thousand disasters vanish;\nWhen the heart is empty, ten thousand cares turn to ash.\n\nA pure breeze passes through jade doors,\nAnd of itself, sweet music comes.\n\nLook outward at form,\nAnd find form is not form.\nAll appearances are seen as non-appearance—\nForm is but a seed of nothingness.\n\nInwardly containing the true Dharma-realm,\nThe body merges with the great Void.\nClouds grow still, and the toad’s light emerges;\nThe pool settles, and silk-white hues spread.\n\nSuch clear revelation—\nWhere else would one seek a special path?\n\nObserve things from afar,\nAnd find things are not things.\nWhen these three are awakened,\nOnly emptiness is seen.\n\nIn tranquil illumination, observe all things—\nHow could the host of spirits differ?\nThe same truth is not to be seen;\nTraces vanish, and none can imitate.\n\nThe elder in the hall, clear and bright,\nRests beyond all dharmas.\nMysterious, mysterious—mystery dissolves,\nAnd the eight directions stretch boundless.\n\nObserve emptiness, and emptiness too is empty—\nEmptiness has no emptiness.\nThe vast expanse of true emptiness opens;\nLooking back, not one thing remains.\n\nFused with the great desert,\nProfoundly still, the essence is void.\nIlluminating through, sound is ever silent;\nPerfectly penetrating, nature is spontaneous.\n\nWithin and without are as one,\nNot returning to the primordial origin.\nWhat is emptied is already nothing—\nNothingness, too, is nothing.\n\nWhen the heart is seen as no-thing,\nNothingness itself is truly nothing.\nWhy labor to remove delusion?\nWhat need to distinguish fine from coarse?\n\nIn stillness and emptiness, skill arises;\nReturning to truth, remain unwavering.\nSuch subtle and secret workings—\nWho would dare impose a name?\n\nWhen nothingness itself is nothing,\nProfoundly still, ever at rest.\nAll dharmas are originally empty;\nNothingness unites with sagely achievement.\n\nProfound stillness is neither within nor without,\nSilent, east and west dissolve.\nWhere heart and realm are both forgotten,\nSquare and round become as one.\n\nVast and obscure, beyond creation,\nAll things are pervaded and free.\nSilence has no silence—\nHow could desire arise?\n\nDesire not arising,\nThis is true stillness.\nProvisional stillness is but a temporary body;\nOne must still remove the cause of desire.\n\nWhen false conditions cease thus,\nTrue stillness renews itself.\nAccord with the unborn Dharma,\nAnd know the spring of endless day.\n\nAlone, beyond heaven and earth,\nAt ease, one roams freely.\nResponding to things with true constancy,\nOne attains the true nature.\n\nConstant in response, constant in stillness,\nEver pure and still.\nOnce settled, one reaches true constancy—\nThe spirit’s light cannot be measured.\n\nIt illuminates the chamber of the three poisons,\nPierces the hall of the five luminaries.\nThe jewel moon appears in the clear sky;\nDeluded clouds vanish without trace.\n\nA pure breeze spreads the message,\nResponding to things as they unfold.\nIn such purity and stillness,\nOne gradually enters the true Dao.\n\nHaving entered the true Dao,\nThis is called attaining the Dao.\nThrough kalpas vast, it remains perfectly complete,\nWithout darkness, without light.\n\nThe Valley Spirit is ever still;\nThe Dharma-sea is serene and clear.\nRight mindfulness follows the true path;\nA settled heart reaches the wondrous course.\n\nForever freed from the bonds of birth and death,\nOne roams the three realms at will.\nThough called attaining the Dao,\nIn truth, there is nothing attained.\n\nHaving sunk into silence, advance through sound;\nDeeply penetrate the subtle principle.\nTrue emptiness—could there be attainment?\nTrue form originally requires no cultivation.\n\nEating and drinking pass as they will;\nDignity and conduct are free.\nSuddenly, all deliberation ceases—\nIn tranquility, wholeness is preserved.\n\nTo transform sentient beings,\nThis is called attaining the Dao.\nThose who awaken to it\nMay transmit the sagely Dao.\n\nTo enlighten sentient beings,\nAll manner of seeking is forgotten.\nInstantly transcending the fruit of no-leakage,\nHow could there be any root or cause?\n\nGrasping and rejecting cannot move it;\nCausal conditions too are cut off.\nSuddenly, all is let go—\nThe sagely Dao may be transmitted and preserved.\n\nLaozi said:\nThe superior person does not contend;\nThe inferior person loves to contend.\nWhy does the superior person not contend?\nDiligently, they hold fast to their resolve.\n\nDwelling in truth, ever serene,\nCultivating simplicity, hidden in mystery.\nLooking up and down, they observe heaven’s principle,\nWhether in poverty or success, they reach the Dao’s depths.\n\nAlas for those who have not yet awakened—\nThey vie for dharmas, obscuring their heart-fields.\n\nSuperior virtue does not act as virtue;\nInferior virtue clings to virtue.\nThose who cling\nCannot be called virtuous.\n\nVirtue’s transformation seeks no reward;\nBroad in kindness, they refuse to boast.\nVeiling their light, they conceal great capacity;\nTheir bright nature shines like solid ice.\n\nSilently, they accord with the distant heavens;\nDeeply, they penetrate the vast Dao.\nHow could they be like foolish scholars,\nWho cling to distinctions and boast of their abilities?\n\nSentient beings do not attain the true Dao\nBecause they have deluded minds.\nMost turn their backs on the Dao,\nSeeking outwardly in confusion.\n\nDelusion arises from this;\nThe true spirit dims and fades.\nOriginally, nothing is lacking—\nWhy forcefully persist in cultivation?\n\nSuddenly, the clouds of delusion are swept away,\nAnd the silver toad shines upon the jade tower.\n\nOnce there is a deluded mind,\nIt startles the spirit.\nOnce the spirit is startled,\nIt clings to the myriad things.\nOnce it clings to the myriad things,\nGreed and seeking arise.\nOnce greed and seeking arise,\nThis is affliction.\n\nPlanning affairs gives rise to delusion;\nDeparting from truth agitates the spirit.\nAll stems from the heart’s attachment to desire,\nClinging to things, stirring anger and blame.\n\nConstantly harboring the fire of ignorance,\nIt adds to the dust of affliction.\nFrom this, one receives karmic retribution,\nRevolving through the six paths in suffering.\n\nAffliction and delusion,\nWorry and torment body and mind,\nBringing defilement and disgrace.\nFrom delusion arise anger and desire;\nFrom attachment and ignorance, obstacles form.\n\nSorrow and worry bind one endlessly;\nAffliction coils ceaselessly.\nThus, one strays from the true Dao,\nAnd from this, falls into karmic transgressions.\n\nTurning the light inward in reflection,\nOne awakens to the wondrous mystery within.\nDrifting through birth and death,\nConstantly sinking in the sea of suffering,\nForever losing the true Dao.\n\nAffliction arises from thoughts—\nWhen has one ever awakened to one’s own heart?\nVast and boundless, suffering and disgrace;\nRestless and troubled, how could one pause to reflect?\n\nDying in vain without respite,\nLiving emptily until now.\nThus, the true Dao is lost,\nAnd dream-thoughts invade ever more.\n\nThe true and constant Dao\nIs attained by those who awaken.\nThose who awaken to the Dao\nAre ever pure and still.\n\nIf one penetrates heaven and earth,\nBoth are sustained by the Dao’s qi.\nHiding the root, deepening the stem,\nExtinguishing the po, the hun is at peace.\n\nHaving awakened to the path of long life,\nOne must open the gate of enduring vision.\nThe whole spirit transforms itself—\nSupreme Dharma King, revered.\n\nThe Most High Lord Lao said *The Eulogy and Annotation of the Classic of Constant Purity and Stillness*, thus concluded.",

      "translated_text": "When desire’s taint arises, how can it be dispelled?\nPerverse and cunning thoughts only lead one further astray.\nYet turning the head, one may awaken—\nIn self-reflection, the Empty King is seen.\n\nThose who can dispel it look inward at the mind,\nAnd find the mind is not the mind.\nAwakened to all sensory leaks,\nThe eye of Dao opens clearly.\n\nForm and sound are not obstacles;\nKnowledge and perception must be buried deep.\nWhen spirit is still, a thousand disasters vanish;\nWhen the heart is empty, ten thousand cares turn to ash.\n\nA pure breeze passes through jade doors,\nAnd of itself, sweet music comes.\n\nLook outward at form,\nAnd find form is not form.\nAll appearances are seen as non-appearance—\nForm is but a seed of nothingness.\n\nInwardly containing the true Dharma-realm,\nThe body merges with the great Void.\nClouds grow still, and the toad’s light emerges;\nThe pool settles, and silk-white hues spread.\n\nSuch clear revelation—\nWhere else would one seek a special path?\n\nObserve things from afar,\nAnd find things are not things.\nWhen these three are awakened,\nOnly emptiness is seen.\n\nIn tranquil illumination, observe all things—\nHow could the host of spirits differ?\nThe same truth is not to be seen;\nTraces vanish, and none can imitate.\n\nThe elder in the hall, clear and bright,\nRests beyond all dharmas.\nMysterious, mysterious—mystery dissolves,\nAnd the eight directions stretch boundless.\n\nObserve emptiness, and emptiness too is empty—\nEmptiness has no emptiness.\nThe vast expanse of true emptiness opens;\nLooking back, not one thing remains.\n\nFused with the great desert,\nProfoundly still, the essence is void.\nIlluminating through, sound is ever silent;\nPerfectly penetrating, nature is spontaneous.\n\nWithin and without are as one,\nNot returning to the primordial origin.\nWhat is emptied is already nothing—\nNothingness, too, is nothing.\n\nWhen the heart is seen as no-thing,\nNothingness itself is truly nothing.\nWhy labor to remove delusion?\nWhat need to distinguish fine from coarse?\n\nIn stillness and emptiness, skill arises;\nReturning to truth, remain unwavering.\nSuch subtle and secret workings—\nWho would dare impose a name?\n\nWhen nothingness itself is nothing,\nProfoundly still, ever at rest.\nAll dharmas are originally empty;\nNothingness unites with sagely achievement.\n\nProfound stillness is neither within nor without,\nSilent, east and west dissolve.\nWhere heart and realm are both forgotten,\nSquare and round become as one.\n\nVast and obscure, beyond creation,\nAll things are pervaded and free.\nSilence has no silence—\nHow could desire arise?\n\nDesire not arising,\nThis is true stillness.\nProvisional stillness is but a temporary body;\nOne must still remove the cause of desire.\n\nWhen false conditions cease thus,\nTrue stillness renews itself.\nAccord with the unborn Dharma,\nAnd know the spring of endless day.\n\nAlone, beyond heaven and earth,\nAt ease, one roams freely.\nResponding to things with true constancy,\nOne attains the true nature.\n\nConstant in response, constant in stillness,\nEver pure and still.\nOnce settled, one reaches true constancy—\nThe spirit’s light cannot be measured.\n\nIt illuminates the chamber of the three poisons,\nPierces the hall of the five luminaries.\nThe jewel moon appears in the clear sky;\nDeluded clouds vanish without trace.\n\nA pure breeze spreads the message,\nResponding to things as they unfold.\nIn such purity and stillness,\nOne gradually enters the true Dao.\n\nHaving entered the true Dao,\nThis is called attaining the Dao.\nThrough kalpas vast, it remains perfectly complete,\nWithout darkness, without light.\n\nThe Valley Spirit is ever still;\nThe Dharma-sea is serene and clear.\nRight mindfulness follows the true path;\nA settled heart reaches the wondrous course.\n\nForever freed from the bonds of birth and death,\nOne roams the three realms at will.\nThough called attaining the Dao,\nIn truth, there is nothing attained.\n\nHaving sunk into silence, advance through sound;\nDeeply penetrate the subtle principle.\nTrue emptiness—could there be attainment?\nTrue form originally requires no cultivation.\n\nEating and drinking pass as they will;\nDignity and conduct are free.\nSuddenly, all deliberation ceases—\nIn tranquility, wholeness is preserved.\n\nTo transform sentient beings,\nThis is called attaining the Dao.\nThose who awaken to it\nMay transmit the sagely Dao.\n\nTo enlighten sentient beings,\nAll manner of seeking is forgotten.\nInstantly transcending the fruit of no-leakage,\nHow could there be any root or cause?\n\nGrasping and rejecting cannot move it;\nCausal conditions too are cut off.\nSuddenly, all is let go—\nThe sagely Dao may be transmitted and preserved.\n\nLaozi said:\nThe superior person does not contend;\nThe inferior person loves to contend.\nWhy does the superior person not contend?\nDiligently, they hold fast to their resolve.\n\nDwelling in truth, ever serene,\nCultivating simplicity, hidden in mystery.\nLooking up and down, they observe heaven’s principle,\nWhether in poverty or success, they reach the Dao’s depths.\n\nAlas for those who have not yet awakened—\nThey vie for dharmas, obscuring their heart-fields.\n\nSuperior virtue does not act as virtue;\nInferior virtue clings to virtue.\nThose who cling\nCannot be called virtuous.\n\nVirtue’s transformation seeks no reward;\nBroad in kindness, they refuse to boast.\nVeiling their light, they conceal great capacity;\nTheir bright nature shines like solid ice.\n\nSilently, they accord with the distant heavens;\nDeeply, they penetrate the vast Dao.\nHow could they be like foolish scholars,\nWho cling to distinctions and boast of their abilities?\n\nSentient beings do not attain the true Dao\nBecause they have deluded minds.\nMost turn their backs on the Dao,\nSeeking outwardly in confusion.\n\nDelusion arises from this;\nThe true spirit dims and fades.\nOriginally, nothing is lacking—\nWhy forcefully persist in cultivation?\n\nSuddenly, the clouds of delusion are swept away,\nAnd the silver toad shines upon the jade tower.\n\nOnce there is a deluded mind,\nIt startles the spirit.\nOnce the spirit is startled,\nIt clings to the myriad things.\nOnce it clings to the myriad things,\nGreed and seeking arise.\nOnce greed and seeking arise,\nThis is affliction.\n\nPlanning affairs gives rise to delusion;\nDeparting from truth agitates the spirit.\nAll stems from the heart’s attachment to desire,\nClinging to things, stirring anger and blame.\n\nConstantly harboring the fire of ignorance,\nIt adds to the dust of affliction.\nFrom this, one receives karmic retribution,\nRevolving through the six paths in suffering.\n\nAffliction and delusion,\nWorry and torment body and mind,\nBringing defilement and disgrace.\nFrom delusion arise anger and desire;\nFrom attachment and ignorance, obstacles form.\n\nSorrow and worry bind one endlessly;\nAffliction coils ceaselessly.\nThus, one strays from the true Dao,\nAnd from this, falls into karmic transgressions.\n\nTurning the light inward in reflection,\nOne awakens to the wondrous mystery within.\nDrifting through birth and death,\nConstantly sinking in the sea of suffering,\nForever losing the true Dao.\n\nAffliction arises from thoughts—\nWhen has one ever awakened to one’s own heart?\nVast and boundless, suffering and disgrace;\nRestless and troubled, how could one pause to reflect?\n\nDying in vain without respite,\nLiving emptily until now.\nThus, the true Dao is lost,\nAnd dream-thoughts invade ever more.\n\nThe true and constant Dao\nIs attained by those who awaken.\nThose who awaken to the Dao\nAre ever pure and still.\n\nIf one penetrates heaven and earth,\nBoth are sustained by the Dao’s qi.\nHiding the root, deepening the stem,\nExtinguishing the po, the hun is at peace.\n\nHaving awakened to the path of long life,\nOne must open the gate of enduring vision.\nThe whole spirit transforms itself—\nSupreme Dharma King, revered.\n\nThe Most High Lord Lao said *The Eulogy and Annotation of the Classic of Constant Purity and Stillness*, thus concluded.",
      "overlap_context": "antly cease; the three poisons’ afflictions must be cured.\nThe wondrous Dao transcends kalpas of emptiness; the whole spirit ascends to the heavens above.\nIn these subtle and secret places, the Mysterious Female perpetuates itself.\n\nThose who cannot do so fail because the mind is not yet clarified and desires are not yet dispelled.\nLost on the path, they forsake their homeland, all due to obscuring their own radiance.\nThe mind, floating, is truly easily moved; familiar realms are hard to forget.",
