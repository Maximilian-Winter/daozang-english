  "full_translation": "**The True Interpretation of the Journey to the West, Chapter One**\n\n**The Spiritual Root Takes Form and Flows Forth; Cultivation of Mind and Nature Gives Birth to the Great Dao**\n\nWu Yizi said: This clarifies that the root-source of the Great Dao is the primordial qi of yin and yang, the precelestial origin of the Hunyuan Taiyi, the True Yi born from nonbeing. By fully realizing the mind and knowing one’s nature through cultivation, one may attain an indestructible golden body and live as long as heaven and earth.\n\nThe two guiding lines of this chapter place greatest emphasis on the first, which encapsulates the author’s overarching principle. Those who interpret it by focusing solely on the word \"mind,\" recklessly imposing misguided annotations, obscure the root-source of the Great Dao and thus fail to comprehend it. Not only do they misunderstand the mind, but they entirely abandon the true essence of the immortal masters’ teachings on liberating the world—how lamentable, how pitiful!\n\nThe \"spiritual root\" spoken of first is the precelestial True Yi qi. As the *Classic* says: *\"Nameless, it is the beginning of heaven and earth; named, it is the mother of the myriad things.\"* It also states: *\"These two emerge together but bear different names.\"* When it is in its qi-state, the True Yi qi is invisible, hence it is the beginning of heaven and earth. When it takes form, the True Yi pearl appears within the void, hence it is the mother of the myriad things. From the One qi arise yin and yang; from yin and yang arise the Four Images; from the Four Images arise the Five Phases; from the Five Phases arise the myriad things—all transformations of the True Yi qi.\n\nAs qi, it stands before heaven and earth and enters within them. It begins as being born from nonbeing, then reverts to being born from being. One who attains this One qi can encompass all phenomena. Thus it is said: *\"Obtain the One, and all matters are complete.\"*\n\n*The Awakening to Reality* states:\n*\"The Dao from emptiness gives birth to the One qi,\nFrom the One qi arise yin and yang,\nYin and yang unite to form the Three Bodies,\nFrom the Three Bodies flourish the myriad things.\"*\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: *\"Heaven and earth intermingle, and the myriad things transform into purity.\"*\n\nFrom the beginning, the Primordial One attained the Dao through a single precious pearl. The sages of the Three Teachings all directly explored this root-source, penetrating the workings of creation.\n\nFor the Dao gives birth to the One qi, the One qi gives birth to form, and within form is contained the original qi. Thus, *\"Heaven One gives birth to water,\"* and water is Ren-water. Ren is the ancestral qi of the True One that generates all things. Ren-water’s phase of long life is in *shen* (the ninth earthly branch), and *shen* is the monkey. *Shen*-metal is born from earth, and stone is the essence and core of earth’s qi—hence the Stone Monkey.\n\nAccording to the celestial cycle of 365 degrees, the twenty-four qi, the Nine Palaces, and the Eight Trigrams, this aligns with what *The Awakening to Reality* states: *\"The Five Phases and Four Images all rely on earth; how could the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams depart from Ren?\"*\n\nYi is the wood of flowers and fruit, born in *zhen* (the east), the place where yang qi first arises. Its natal tone is metal within the sea, hence its location in the Flower-Fruit Mountain of the Eastern Continent of Superior Body. This metal within water is the true gold of the precelestial True Yi before the birth of one’s parents—thus, without father or mother, it is born from a stone egg by Heaven as father and Earth as mother.\n\nIts eyes emitted two beams of golden light, but after consuming postnatal water, the golden light receded and gradually faded, losing its originally endowed nature. Because it is metal within water, it dwells in the Water-Curtain Cave. Within it lies an iron-plank bridge, clearly a celestial and terrestrial creation, not something fashioned by human effort. Such an endowment, once obtained, means *\"my fate is not determined by Heaven\"*—one is no longer subject to the qi of old Heaven.\n\nIndeed, it is the supreme sovereign of joy between Heaven and Earth, hence the title Handsome Monkey King. From what I have heard of the reckoning of Heaven and Earth, this fully clarifies the profound subtleties of the spiritual root’s origin and flow—yet nowhere is the word \"heart\" to be found. The immortal master employs a poetic turn, subtly shifting the focus onto the human body, making it abundantly clear: he borrows the name of the monkey merely to complete the perfection of the Golden Elixir’s great Dao. Were all people through the ages to achieve such perfection, they too would be called outer kings and inner sages, free to act as they please—not because the heart is difficult to master.\n\nThe following passage then explains that one must personally examine its wonders, fully comprehend the heart and know one’s nature, and diligently cultivate and uphold what is most precious. The human body is hard to obtain, a century passes in an instant; one should urgently awaken the heart of the Dao and strive for oneself. Know that the Way of immortals, Buddhas, and sages, the method of longevity and agelessness, is within everyone’s reach—yet how pitiful that all people in the world are mere pursuers of fame and profit, with not a single one attending to their own life and destiny. Thus, the immortal master points out a path: journey westward to inquire, reaching the Western Continent of Cattle-Gift, to seek out the whereabouts of a divine immortal.\n\nAlas! Do immortals choose where they are born? Could it truly be that the Southern Jambu Continent has none, while the Western Continent of Cattle-Gift does? The immortal master’s intent is merely to indicate that the south is a land where fire flourishes, not a place where metal is born—only in the west is true gold produced. This aligns with the overarching theme of the entire book: the scriptures must be sought in the west.\n\nHe speaks of a filial gentleman, for filial piety is the foundation of practicing benevolence and is akin to the Way of immortals. Thus, they are neighbors, and within this lies a profound meaning. The Way of immortals is water giving birth to metal, not metal giving birth to water—an image of the mother nurturing the child in the womb, the child repaying the mother’s kindness, both mirroring the path of filial piety.\n\nThe woodcutter said, “Not far, not far. This mountain is called the Mountain of the Numinous Terrace and Square Inch; upon it lies the Cave of the Slanting Moon and Three Stars. Within the cave dwells a divine immortal, known as the Venerable Patriarch Subhūti.” *Subhūti* in Sanskrit means the true Dao in our tongue. Here, the text explicitly mentions the Numinous Terrace and Square Inch—a hook and three dots—readers will surely say this refers to the character for \"heart,\" and how could I deny it points to the heart?\n\nAlas! They are mistaken.\n\nIf one claims this refers to the heart, then by inquiring into the heart, engaging in meditation, sitting in dhyāna, dispelling desires, and following principle, one could attain longevity—why then seek immortality, quest for the Dao, or rush about east and west? To regard this heart as the heart of Heaven and Earth may be acceptable, but to take it as the heart of the human heart is far from the mark!\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: *\"Not far off is the return; in the return is seen the heart of Heaven and Earth.\"* Yet the heart of Heaven and Earth cannot be seen—only through the hexagram *Fù* (Return), Earth and Thunder, is the heart of Heaven and Earth revealed. For when stillness reaches its extreme, movement arises, and from movement, yang is born. Generation upon generation continues, all rooted in *Kūn* (Earth). Thus, the *Cantong Qi* says: *\"By the mother is the foundation laid\"*—that is, *Kūn* gives birth to *Fù*. It further states: *\"The sixth line of *Kūn* upholds, binding beginning and end. It nurtures all children, ever the mother of kinds.\"* This is the mother of the ten thousand things. Hence the woodcutter says: *\"That patriarch’s disciples are beyond count\"*—meaning all things emerge from this. He adds: *\"Now there are still thirty or forty following him in cultivation.\"* Those who follow are three in the east, four in the west, and ten in the center, while the patriarch himself is one in the north and two in the south—*Kǎn* and *Lí* in harmonious union, the five phases gathered in clarity.\n\nHe further instructs: *\"Follow that small path southward; his home is not far.\"* From the west to the southwest is not far—is this not the position of *Kūn*? The *Book of Changes* says: *\"In the southwest, one gains companions and proceeds with one’s kind.\"* The *Wuzhen Pian* states: *\"Only in the southwest lies one’s native place.\"* The small path is the position of *Duì* in the west, *Duì* being lesser yin, hence called a \"small path.\" \"His home\" is precisely what the *Wuzhen Pian* refers to as *\"recognizing the deathless method of that other household.\"*\n\nFirst, he says, *\"Not far, not far,\"* then simply *\"not far,\"* clearly alluding to the meaning of *\"not far off is the return.\"* Finally, he says, *\"about seven or eight *li* distant\"*—seven and eight make fifteen, the phase of gold meeting the full moon, its meaning subtle indeed.\n\nAt the outset of the immortal master’s chapter, he cites Shao Yaofu’s poem:\n*\"At the winter solstice, half of *zǐ*,\nThe heart of Heaven remains unchanged.\nWhere the first yang stirs,\nBefore the ten thousand things arise.\"*\nThis clarifies the root of Heaven and reveals the locus of the heart of Heaven. *\"Silent and still, with no trace of man\"*—this is the extreme of yin stillness. Yet before stillness reaches its extreme, the heart of Heaven and Earth is not seen; only when stillness first stirs is the heart of Heaven and Earth revealed. Thus, the image of the Handsome Monkey King leaping onto a pine branch to pluck fruit elucidates the meaning of *Zhèn* (Thunder) wood’s initial stirring at the *zǐ* hour.\n\nSuch are the profound principles expounded. The boy says: *\"My master was lecturing on the Dao but did not explain the reason. He sent me to fetch you—I suppose it must be you.\"* The Monkey King replies: *\"It is I, it is I!\"*—here lies another subtle meaning. For the essence of true yi resides in the east but dwells in the west—this is the principle of yin and yang inverted. Since birth, it has wandered in that other household; now, recognizing it and stating the cause, it is clearly one’s own original possession. Hence he says, *\"It is I, it is I!\"*—echoing the earlier phrase *\"that other household.\"*\n\nSeeing the Venerable Patriarch Subhūti seated upon the dais, with thirty young immortals standing to either side, this embodies the meaning of the *Cantong Qi*: *\"The sixth line of *Kūn* upholds, binding beginning and end\"*—five times six is thirty. Later immortals also take the *Kūn* direction as the place of the moon’s birth, symbolized by the crescent moon. The hook is the crescent, the three dots the three stars. The moon receives the true yang qi and generates brightness, within which lies the image of the three stars—essence, qi, and spirit. *Fù* is the first of yang, the new moon the first of the month. Thus, the *Cantong Qi* says: *\"Five times six, thirty days, the cycle completes and begins anew.\"* Master Wei equates the thirty days of the moon with the *Kūn* hexagram—both express the same idea.\n\nThe poem of the Greatly Awakened Golden Immortal, in its emptiness and true suchness, reveals in every line that only by recognizing the heart of Heaven can one be a great master of the Dharma. Yet to fully realize this heart, one must know one’s nature. Knowing one’s nature, one knows the subtlety of the heart of Heaven and completes the great Dao.\n\nThe Monkey King, with sincere heart and clear ritual, journeys from east to west—all to seek knowledge of his nature. He says: *\"I have no nature,\"* *\"I have no parents,\"* *\"I suppose I was born from a tree,\"* *\"No, I grew from stone.\"* For after birth, he was stained by worldly desires and gradually lost his primordial nature, no longer knowing himself as a thing of *Zhèn* wood from the east, nor as the body of *Duì* metal from the west. How could he not abandon the endowment bestowed by Heaven and Earth?\n\nThus, the greatly compassionate Subhūti says: *\"I shall take a surname for you from your own body. Ancient moon, old yin, cannot transform to bear male offspring—yet ‘infant’ fits perfectly with this discourse.\"* The immortal master has already revealed the wondrousness within nature; no further words are needed. The Monkey King exclaims: *\"Good!\"*\n\n\"Excellent! Excellent! Only today do I know my surname.\" He then exclaimed, \"Wonderful! Wonderful! Wonderful! From this day forth, I shall be called Sun Wukong!\" Should one grasp the meaning of the characters *hao* (excellent), *xing* (surname), and *kong* (emptiness), one would be a being of vast wisdom, a true suchness of the ocean of original nature, awakened and perfectly enlightened. Thus it is said: *\"When chaos first parted, no surnames existed—shatter the stubborn void, and you must awaken to emptiness.\"* Yet to perceive the true nature of the primordial, one must delve deeply into the acquired.\n\n**Chapter Two: Penetrating the Wondrous Truth of the Dao—Severing Demons to Return and Merge with the Original Spirit**\n\nWu Yizi states: This reveals the true and wondrous transmission of the great alchemical Dao, subtly illustrating the method of *\"taking from Kan to fill Li,\"* thereby returning to the root and merging with the original spirit. The key lies in the two characters *\"penetrating awakening\"*—one must focus the mind here. The principles of the true and wondrous Dao require profound awakening and thorough penetration, and only with the transmission of a true master can one properly begin. It is not that this mind is the Dao, nor that awakening alone suffices. If self-cultivation through the mind alone could attain the Dao, then what is awakened? What is attained? This is but the practice of silent sitting in the gate of stillness—ultimately grasping at the moon’s reflection in water, all in vain. Thus, the chapter subtly hints at the meaning of *\"severing demons\"* to return and merge with the original spirit. When he retrieves the golden cudgel from his own cave, it fully embodies the principle of returning to the root and merging with the original spirit.\n\nThe immortal master’s poem reads:\n*\"The three families unite as they naturally are,\nPointing to the unborn, revealing the mystery of nature.\"*\n\nPeople know the *\"three families\"* as three surnames, yet they do not know the three families are one surname. Knowing the wonder of the earlier poem—*\"originally no surname\"*—one then understands the wonder of this poem: *\"the three families unite as they naturally are.\"* Though called three surnames, they are ultimately one surname; though called one surname, they are ultimately no surname.\n\nWhen Wukong hears the master expound the Dao and recognizes its wondrous resonance, it is the moment when he can be spoken to of the Dao. On Rotten Peach Mountain, he ate his fill of peaches seven times. Rotten peaches symbolize the stripping away of the outer husk, revealing the kernel within. The *Cantong Qi* says: *\"Stripping away the limbs, dissolving the form—when the Dao is exhausted, it returns, reverting to the primal Kun.\"* This is the time of *\"stripping down to rise again.\"* The seven times signify the principle of *\"the seventh day’s return.\"* At the moment when the Dao-heart manifests, the ancestral master declares that all four methods—movement, stillness, flow, and quietude—are side doors. Through question and answer, distinctions are made with clarity.\n\nWhat is particularly startling is that within the *\"flow\"* category, the Confucian, Buddhist, and Daoist traditions are deemed side doors, and within the *\"stillness\"* category, practices like *\"pure quietude and non-action\"* and *\"guarding the spirit to enter samadhi\"* are likewise labeled as such. This is bound to arouse astonishment. Why? The Confucian seeks to rectify the heart, the Buddhist to illuminate the mind, and the Daoist to contemplate the mind. *\"Pure quietude and non-action\"* is the heart-method of Laozi; *\"meditating and entering samadhi\"* is the mind-seal of the Buddha. All cultivate the mind, perfectly aligning with the interpretation of *\"monkey-mind and horse-intent\"* in *Journey to the West*, the understanding of *\"gathering the scattered mind.\"* Yet now, it is said to be like *\"setting a pillar in a wall\"* or *\"a brick in a kiln\"*—abandoning this to seek the true mind elsewhere leaves one bewildered: where is it to be found?\n\nAlas! This reveals the long-standing error in reading and interpreting *Journey to the West* as *\"monkey-mind and horse-intent,\"* the superficiality of *\"gathering the scattered mind.\"* The immortal master has already made this plainly evident, and it is not my private opinion. The great sages of the three teachings devoted themselves to cultivating the Dao, not to equating the cultivation of the mind with the Dao. It is acceptable to say the Dao harmonizes with the monkey-mind; it is unacceptable to say the monkey-mind is the Dao. The common interpretations of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism as *\"monkey-mind and horse-intent,\"* as *\"gathering the scattered mind,\"* are why the master explicitly calls them side doors, not the supreme and true great Dao of the golden elixir.\n\nThis Dao, even the naturally most intelligent Wukong could not comprehend—thus he had to seek the transmission from Subhuti. As the Perfected One of Purple Yang said: *\"Even if one’s wisdom surpasses Yan and Min, without a true teacher, do not force guesses.\"* Had Wukong not been of the most naturally intelligent and wished to force guesses from within himself, could he have heard of it? There are also those vulgar and foolish men who, with their *\"yin-cultivation and yang-supplementation\"* heresies, deceive and distort the sacred scriptures. Thus, the master first refutes their delusions in the *\"movement\"* category, urging those with aspirations to learn the Dao to pay close attention.\n\nThis Dao is transmitted but once in ten thousand kalpas—it is not imparted to those unworthy. The Patriarch Subhuti set it as a riddle within a tray, transmitting it in secret. Wukong was able to shatter the tray, kneel in faith, and receive it—truly a seed of Buddhahood. The Patriarch then chanted from his mouth: *\"Difficult! Difficult! Difficult!\"*\n\nThe Dao is most profound.\nDo not treat the Golden Elixir as commonplace.\nWithout meeting a perfected master to transmit the wondrous formula,\nOne’s words will but parley the tongue dry!\n\nKnow then that the Way of the Golden Elixir must be received through a master’s transmission—it cannot be sought among men. Yet though Wukong shattered the tray’s riddle, discerning that three taps meant the third watch, that the closed gate was the back door for entry, and that the Dao was transmitted in secret, he still regulated his breath, gathered his spirit, and waited until the hour before or after midnight to stealthily open the back door, approach the sleeping couch, and kneel to beseech the Way of long life. The Patriarch intoned:\n\n*\"The wondrous formula of perfect esoteric and exoteric teachings—\nNothing else avails in cultivating nature and destiny.\nAll comes down to essence, qi, and spirit:\nGuard them firmly, seal them well, let no leakage occur.\nLet no leakage occur—conceal them within the body,\nAnd the Dao you receive shall flourish of itself.\nRemember this oral formula, for it brings great benefit:\nBanish perverse desires to attain cool clarity.\nAttain cool clarity, and radiance will shine pure.\nThen ascend the cinnabar terrace to admire the bright moon.\nThe moon conceals the Jade Hare, the sun conceals the Golden Crow,\nWhile the Tortoise and Serpent coil in mutual embrace.\nCoiled in embrace, nature and destiny grow firm,\nEnabling one to plant golden lotuses in fire.\nGathering and reversing the Five Agents,\nWhen the work is complete, one becomes Buddha or immortal.\"*\n\nThis is the beginning and end of the Golden Elixir’s workings, every word encompassing all. If one receives the oral formula’s guidance, one may then hear the Dao. Within it, the three crucial words—essence, qi, and spirit—lest they be misconstrued, I shall explicitly point out: this essence is not the essence of intercourse, this qi is not the qi of breathing, and this spirit is not the spirit of thought. Take care not to grope within your own mind and fall into the delusion of the \"monkey-mind and horse-intent,\" mistaking the \"scattered mind\" for the true.\n\nThe Patriarch revealed the root source, and Wukong memorized the oral formula, secretly upholding it. The workings of the Golden Elixir—warming and nurturing before midnight and after noon—after three years, his dharma-nature became quite penetrating. Yet after five hundred years, Heaven would send a thunder calamity, requiring him to see his nature and clarify his mind. Know that seeing one’s nature and clarifying the mind are matters *after* the Elixir’s completion. Without seeing nature and clarifying the mind, principle and desire remain mixed, unable to achieve purity, and one falls into heterodoxy. Thus, the heavenly spirits cannot tolerate it, and the thunder calamity is unavoidable. Such external disasters are still relatively easy to evade. But if one cannot see nature and clarify the mind, the body’s yin fire remains unremoved, and over time, it accumulates into harm, spontaneously generating fire calamities. If one cannot see nature and clarify the mind, the body’s yin qi remains uncleansed, and over time, it accumulates into misfortune, spontaneously generating wind calamities. These three calamities arise after the Dao’s completion, necessitating a return to the ultimate state of non-action and original truth.\n\nAfter transmitting the oral formula, the Patriarch saw the practitioner master transformations: first climbing clouds, then the somersault cloud, all demonstrating that by seeing nature and clarifying the mind, one can transcend the mundane and share in Heaven and Earth’s transformations, progressing from strenuous effort to spiritual transformation. Readers of *Journey to the West* see the seventy-two transformations and the thirty-six-thousand-mile somersault and interpret them as the mind. But if it were merely the mind, it would be empty delusion—precisely the \"scattered mind\"—what true reality or solid foundation would there be? They do not know that this is the wondrous efficacy of the Golden Elixir, a true and practical skill. Transformations are not limited to ten thousand times ten thousand, but are summarized by the seventy-two seasonal qi movements; somersaults are not limited to ten thousand times ten thousand, but are summarized by the number of the two *zang* organs. This Dao is only for self-knowledge and should not be flaunted before crowds. Thus, since ancient times, Buddhas and immortals who attained the Dao would transcend and depart, concealing their brilliance, for they had truly seen their nature and clarified their minds.\n\nWhen the practitioner transformed into a tree to play tricks, he inevitably startled the crowd—what kind of world would that be? Thus, the Patriarch said: *\"Dare you flaunt this skill before others? If someone seeks it from you, should you fear misfortune, you may only transmit it to them; if you do not, they will surely harm you.\"* From this, know that as long as one has not left the mortal world, one must never flaunt one’s skills before others. Therefore, the Patriarch transmitted another method to him, saying: *\"Go now. Return whence you came.\"* This was to teach him to return to his origin to avoid calamity.\n\nNevertheless, the seventy-two transformations correspond to the year’s seasonal nodes; climbing clouds represents the arrival of dharma-essence; \"beware the intentional man\" means to guard one’s mind closely; the thirty-six thousand miles correspond to the number of the two *zang* organs; transforming into a pine tree signifies the union of metal and wood, lead and mercury; the moving tongue that stirs up right and wrong signifies the need for discreet refinement; not flaunting before others is to guard against unforeseen calamities; \"whence you came, thither return\" means coming from the East and returning to the East—this is how one preserves life and nature. Only those who have received a master’s transmission may claim to have mastered it. In less than an hour, he saw Flower-Fruit Mountain and the Water-Curtain Cave, and the Handsome Monkey King knew bliss—for the Golden Elixir had succeeded. Here again is a riddle within a riddle, a mystery within a mystery, which no ordinary person could shatter. All are whispered secrets, wondrous methods within the oral formula.\n\nThe oral formula of the Golden Elixir could not be written down by the Patriarch, and fearing that worldly people would forever struggle to comprehend it, he subtly revealed its meaning to Wukong after his return to the cave, enacting a tale of demon-quelling. It was made clear that upon returning to the cave, one must first sever this demon. The Monkey King was metal within water, departing the East for the West. From the day of his departure, the water of due North mingled with the Water-Curtain Cave, and the monkeys of the cave mingled with the water *zang* of due North—hence, the \"Demon King of the Turbid World.\"\n\n\"Due North belongs to *Kan*, hence he wields a blade; its color is black, so he wears a black headscarf, dons a dark robe, black armor below, and black boots. Within *Kan* lies metal, yet through turbidity it becomes a demon.\n\nWukong said, 'I hail from due South.'\nDue South is the *Li* Palace.\nNo weapon, bare head, red garments, a yellow sash, and riding boots—all embody the essence of *Li*.\nWithin fire yet metal gleams—is this not the absence of weapons?\nRound in form, like the sun—is this not a bare head?\nThe sun’s radiance—is this not red clothing?\nThe sun’s yellow path—is this not a yellow sash?\nThe golden crow within the sun—is this not black boots?\nMost wondrous are the two hands hooking the moon at the edge of the sky.\nThe moon is true *yin*, coupling with the sun to birth yang’s soul.\nThe waxing moon is hooked by the left hand, the waning moon by the right.\nWhen the moon is full, yang’s soul fills its wheel, and both hands hook it.\nThus, one who can hook the moon at the sky’s edge completes the great Dao, and the visceral demon severs itself—hence, the demonic metal is seized and turned to one’s use.\nA single strike to the crown splits it in two—how marvelous!\nThe water of due North’s *Kan*, cleaved in two by one blade, transforms the odd into the even.\n*Kan*’s water, now steadfast, reverts to *Kun*—is this not scorched dry, wholly returning to the unity of *Qian*?\nThe lost child vanishes and instantly returns home, while the *Water-Visceral Cave*’s monkeys, no longer adrift, tread solid ground, recognize their homeland, and escape *Kan* to fill *Qian* and exhaust *Li*.\n\nWukong then utters the words of the Dao’s absence in the South, pointing the way to the West.\nSuch brushstrokes in the Immortal Master’s book—without penetrating *yin-yang* or fathoming creation’s workings, how could one grasp their meaning?\nThis is what is called 'severing the demon to return to the root and unite with the primordial spirit'—is this not the true merit of sharing heaven’s lifespan, the great gateway to undying longevity?\nWith the attainment of pure yang, descendants endure unbroken, transformations boundless—how could heaven, earth, or the netherworld restrain them?\n\n**Chapter Three: The Four Seas and Thousand Mountains All Bow in Submission, The Nine Netherworlds and Ten Kinds All Lose Their Names**\n\nWu Yizi said: This elucidates the great Dao of the Golden Elixir as the metal within water. One who attains its truth can, from the near to the distant, from the manifest to the hidden, extend their will without hindrance across the earth.\nSince obtaining the metal from the *Demon King of the Turbid World*, Wukong swiftly seized the metal from the armory of Aolai Country, then gathered the tribute metal from the seventy-two caves. Flower Fruit Mountain became an ironclad golden fortress, its foundation unshakable, its reach boundless—yet it had not yet attained spiritual communion.\nThus, the Monkey King said, 'This blade of mine is truly fierce, but it does not fulfill my intent.'\nFor this Dao prizes centrality and purity, only then can it advance unimpeded.\nThus, the quest to seek broadly from the sea cannot cease.\"\n\nSeeking the iron plate beneath the Iron-Plate Bridge is a principle of certainty. One who styles himself a Heaven-Born Sage, beyond birth and extinction, and claims extraordinary destiny must obtain the Ultimate Oneness to wield it.\n\nThe Dragon King produced a great halberd—this was Qian’s first yang, yet it was not to be used. He then brought forth a nine-pronged fork—this was Qian’s fourth yang, but it did not suit his intent. The weight of three thousand six hundred catties corresponded to four nines, thirty-six, encompassing the first, second, and third yang lines. Next appeared a painted-shaft square halberd—this was Qian’s third, fourth, and top yang lines, uniting three lines into eight nines, seven thousand two hundred catties—still not to his liking.\n\nOnly when the Heaven-River Bottom-Stabilizing Divine Iron was mentioned—Yu the Great’s gauge for measuring the depths of rivers and seas—did enlightenment dawn. This treasure had been passed from Yao to Shun, and Shun to Yu, transmitted through the sages as the essence of centrality, the very core of Qian’s fifth yang, the true mean of the Dragon’s virtue. None but a Heaven-Born Sage, possessed of effortless great courage, could bear such a burden! The Dragon King declared, \"It cannot be lifted, nor carried!\"\n\nThe iron radiated ten thousand beams of golden light—for from it arise all principles and all things. Its length of two *zhang* signified two fives making ten; the directions—east three, south two, north one, west four, center ten—were all embodied. The two golden bands at either end and the black iron in the center represented the principle of \"grasping the two extremes and employing the mean.\" Named the Compliant Golden-Hooped Rod, it weighed thirteen thousand five hundred catties—for compliance meant adapting perfectly to the mind’s every movement. Thirteen thousand five hundred catties corresponded to nine and five nines, forty-five—this was the nine-five. It also concealed the numbers three and four, twelve, symbolizing the directions of east, west, south, north, and center. Twelve thousand, plus fifteen, embodied the meaning of three and five. This instrument thus encompassed the entire hexagram of Qian.\n\nAs the Monkey King pondered and murmured, the rod shrank to a length of one *zhang* and two *chi*, as thick as a rice bowl—revealing its ability to transform at will, possessing constancy within inconstancy. The length of one *zhang* and two *chi* also signified three and four, twelve; the bowl’s mouth represented perfect roundness, showing inconstancy within constancy. For it was firm, strong, central, and pure—utterly refined. Such was the marvel of this enlightened instrument when grasped.\n\nFor centuries, readers and commentators of *Journey to the West* have all claimed this rod symbolizes the mind, fixating on the word \"compliant.\" Yet do they not know the *Doctrine of the Mean*’s preface speaks of \"the treasure of the sage, the correct Dao\"? Is this truly the mind, or not? Why not ponder deeply the passage: \"It begins with one principle, unfolds into ten thousand affairs, and in the end returns to one principle—when extended, it fills the six directions; when retracted, it withdraws into secrecy\"?\n\nThe Golden-Hooped Rod, passed down through the sages, clearly embodies the essential principle of centrality. Daoist adepts call it \"the metal within water\"—the utmost truth and wonder within the great Dao, beyond words. When Wukong held it in his hand, he grasped the mean. \"One guest does not offend two hosts,\" and \"without a fixed destination, he does not leave\"—this is the non-dual Dharma gate. \"Walking three houses is not as good as sitting in one,\" and \"seeking ten thousand things is still seeking one thing\"—for three houses are ultimately one house, ten thousand things ultimately one thing, as the saying goes: \"Obtain the One, and all affairs are complete.\" \"Not going, not going, adapting to high and low\"—this is not clinging to principle to chase after things, but awaiting their arrival to respond. \"Beating the drum and striking the bell, all assemble in an instant\"—its influence is vast, its spiritual resonance swift.\n\nEast is the Wood of the Azure Dragon, and only with the tribute of three beings was the rod made complete. Herein lies the meaning of consulting the Four Peaks and harmonizing the Four Symbols. Such was the subtlety of the immortal master’s naming.\n\nThe silk slippers emerged from water—this was the Dark Warrior, the north. The chainmail armor was forged from metal—this was the White Tiger, the west. The phoenix-winged crown blazed with fire—this was the Vermilion Bird, the south. Thus, from east, west, south, and north, all submitted without resistance. This was the guiding principle: \"The thousand mountains and four seas all bow in submission.\"\n\nWukong leapt from the waves, his body not a drop wet. Golden light gleamed as he walked onto the bridge—for he now embodied the pure Qian hexagram, and the Dao’s essence was complete. Holding the treasure in his hand, he could make it large or small at will, displaying a divine power that modeled heaven and earth. The rod reached up to the thirty-third heaven and down to the eighteenth layer of hell. When he withdrew the cosmic form, it shrank back into an embroidery needle, which he tucked into his ear. Readers of *Journey to the West* marvel at such wondrous transformations, dismissing them as impossible—mere metaphors for the mind’s subtlety. Yet this is the most ordinary of principles: \"When extended, it fills the six directions; when retracted, it withdraws into secrecy.\" How can this be called the \"monkey mind\" or \"horse intent\"?\n\nThis Dao commands not only the submission of demons, humans, and spirits but also the reverence of the hidden and the strange. The four monkeys and six kings make ten kinds. From the great—dragons, roc, lions, and macaques—to all creatures that fly, walk, or crawl, and all beings with consciousness, none are not encompassed by it.\n\nLord Laozi said: \"The Gate of the Mysterious Female is called the Root of Creation. All men tread upon it to emerge, and all creeping things without exception proceed from it.\" For one who fully realizes their nature can fully realize the nature of all things. When one is fully realized, all are fully realized—and one can then \"lay down the heart.\" Not \"lay down the heart\" but \"lay the heart down,\" not \"the heart laid down\" but \"lay down the heart\"—the profound meaning therein is beyond the understanding of ordinary people.\n\nHere yet arises a tangle of private interpretations and stolen insights. Critics who fix their gaze upon this point declare that the very harm of \"laying down the heart\" lies in its truth—at the threshold of life and death, to \"lay down the heart\" is to invite demonic delusions and drowsy torpor, plunging one into the netherworld. They regard Sun Wukong as never having attained the Dao, relying solely on forced preservation, missing the mark by a vast margin. The guiding principle states, *\"The Nine Netherworlds and Ten Kinds are all erased from the register,\"* for it is made clear that he has already attained the Dao, and thus nothing can bind him. The path of learning, indeed, seeks only to \"lay down the heart.\" Yet if the Dao is truly perfected, one may follow the heart’s desires without restraint. Wukong has already obtained the Golden Cudgel, donned his full armor, and wields the mean with divine transformation—his powers unfathomable. Thus, the phrase *\"lay down the heart\"* is employed to reveal his unobstructed ascent to heaven and descent into earth. How could the mere word \"death\" stir his heart? Hence, the following passage first demonstrates his prowess by entering the netherworld and displaying his artifice.\n\nThose who critique *Journey to the West* consistently mistake the heart for the Dao and \"laying down the heart\" for the heart’s harm, leading to myriad misinterpretations and a loss of truth. They fail to recognize that the heart is precisely the cause of life and death, the root of samsara. The sages speak of preserving the heart as the method for governing the world through moral teachings; the Buddhas and immortals speak of the heart’s absence as the way to transcend the world through non-action. Without penetrating the root, merely clinging to superficial theories of the heart, how can one escape the endless cycle of rebirth? For those who have not attained the Dao, death is death, and life is also death; for those who have attained it, life is life, and death is also life. Unifying life and death as one, one achieves longevity. Fear of death gives rise to the heart of death and thus fails to attain life; fearlessness of death dissolves the heart of life and thus fails to attain death. If one preserves the heart out of fear of death, death arrives swiftly; if one does not know where the heart is stored, it must reside where life arises—within death lies life, and within life lies death. Death after death, life after life—when will it end? Unaware of whether one is human or thing, enduring countless trials without liberation, this is the suffering of eternal death, not the joy of eternal life.\n\nWukong, asleep, saw two figures holding a writ bearing the name \"Sun Wukong.\" The names they bore were inevitably one \"Living Uncertain\" and the other \"Death’s Allotment\"—inescapable, beyond human control. Wukong alone awoke in sudden realization, drew his treasure, and pounded the two death-summoners into mincemeat. He untied his bonds, stormed back into the city, turning the dead to life and the death-summoners to death. The Ten Yama Kings, thrown into chaos, could not command him and ordered him to inspect the Register of Life and Death himself. Upon reaching the *hun* section, entry 1,350, it matched the number of his treasure—also a combination of three and five. At 342 years, the \"hundred\" signified one hundred, also corresponding to the numbers of the five directions: east three, south two, west four, north one, and center ten. He took up the brush and struck through them all. The meaning of this single stroke is profound! The heart is the root of death. Its subtleties shall be expounded in another passage; for now, let us clarify the meaning of the character for \"heart.\"\n\nWhen the hook of the character *xin* (心, \"heart\") points upward, it signifies \"not laying down the heart,\" and thus the ledger of death is recorded; when the hook points downward, it signifies \"laying down the heart,\" and thus the ledger of death is erased. Striking through them all, he declared, *\"Settled! Settled! From now on, you have no authority over me!\"* Such actions shook heaven and earth. Yet for Wukong, it was as effortless as tripping over a blade of grass. A single stumble awakened him—this was the key. Ordinary people take their lives to be a dream; Wukong took death to be a dream. Ordinary people act as if dead while alive; Wukong erased his living name from within death. Venturing into the sea posed no obstacle to his body; entering the netherworld posed no obstacle to his spirit. His divine transformations in exiting and entering the netherworld reached their utmost subtlety. Why, then, did he trip over a blade of grass? The \"blade of grass\" (*caoda*) signifies the dawn of primordial chaos, like the initial hexagram *Zhun*, where chaos first parts, as if awakening from a dream. Yet without ascending to heaven, one cannot witness the power of its unfolding.\n\nObserve how the two memorials reached directly to the heavens, as if serving as his passport. A celestial envoy arrived to welcome him, precisely as he was contemplating the heavens. How vast is the function of the Golden Elixir! Thus, the Perfected Lord of Purple Yang said: *\"Swallow a grain of the Golden Elixir, and you will know your fate is not ruled by heaven.\"*\n\n**Chapter Four: Appointed as Protector of the Horses—Heart Still Unsatisfied; Named Equal of Heaven—Intent Yet Unsettled**\n\nMaster Wu Yi Zi said: This reveals the great Dao of the Golden Fluid and Returning Elixir, where one’s lifespan equals that of heaven, soaring above the Nine Heavens, transcending all bounds—even the Heavenly Emperor cannot restrain him. The Heavenly Emperor, sovereign of heaven and earth, governs the netherworld, encompasses past and present, and has no equal. Only the sage can observe the Dao of heaven and grasp its workings, harmonizing yin and yang, uniting with the divine in virtue, and transforming all things to stand alongside heaven. Why is this so?\n\nGold is indestructible through kalpas; the Elixir is the essence of sun and moon, a mass of pure Yang qi. What heaven and earth circulate is qi; what the Golden Elixir transforms is also qi. The qi of heaven and earth encompasses all; the qi of the Golden Elixir contains all. Thus the *Cantong Qi* states: *\"Nurture essence and cultivate spirit, commune with the virtue of the Three Lights. All evil disperses, and the true qi abides.\"* It also says: *\"Hidden and submerged, it transforms within, enfolding the myriad things as the warp and woof of the Dao.\"* Both speak of the sage’s body and measure equaling that of heaven. What the *Book of Changes* calls *\"harmonizing virtue with heaven and earth, brightness with sun and moon, fortune and misfortune with ghosts and spirits\"*—how does this differ from the *Doctrine of the Mean*’s *\"Heaven and earth take their places, the myriad things are nurtured, all learned and practiced from childhood\"*? That the great sage equals heaven in name—what doubt can there be?\n\nThose who read *Journey to the West* misread its key themes, taking *\"heart still unsatisfied\"* and *\"intent yet unsettled\"* as mere \"monkey-mind and horse-will,\" seizing half a phrase or a single word to force their interpretations. All because they fail to grasp the vastness of the Golden Elixir’s Dao. The Dao of the Golden Elixir unites the Five Emperors and returns to the Supreme Ultimate, steers kalpas through the boundless, and transcends the constraints of heaven and earth—how could the post of Heavenly Stablemaster suffice to match its office? Even the empty title of \"Equal of Heaven\" cannot exhaust its measure.\n\nWhen the Star of Metal and the Monkey King ascend together on clouds, why is the Star of Metal left behind? The Star of Metal is but one of the Five Phases; Sun Wukong embodies all Five Phases. Yet why does he block the gates of heaven, refusing entry? Even the heavenly deities cannot recognize him. The Star of Metal says they have never met, and that upon seeing the Heavenly Honored One, he may come and go as he pleases. Why then does Wukong say, *\"Very well, I shall not enter\"*? It is simply that he refuses to be bound by heaven.\n\nThe Star of Metal reports: *\"The demonic immortal has arrived.\"* The Jade Emperor asks: *\"Which one is the demonic immortal?\"* To call Wukong a demon is a misnomer. Wukong responds at once: *\"This old monkey is.\"* Accepting the title without refusal reveals his capacity for inclusion. All the immortal ministers recoil in shock—his stature is clearly beyond theirs. The Emperor then says: *\"This demonic immortal from the lower realm, newly attained human form, does not understand court etiquette.\"* Though the Heavenly Emperor displays magnanimity, he has not yet discerned Wukong’s wondrous nature as the primordial True One. This is the root of his later inability to subdue him.\n\nWukong bows deeply toward the throne, accepting without refusal. Is this not Wukong encompassing the Heavenly Emperor? The Heavenly Stables lack a director, and the Jade Emperor issues a decree appointing him *Bima Wen*. Upon taking office, *Bima* works day and night without rest, embodying the meaning of *\"Heaven’s movement is ceaseless; the noble person exerts unrelenting effort, vigilant even at dusk, ever striving.\"* Those who annotate *Journey to the West* misinterpret this as the fire-timing of midnight and noon—truly a heretical and absurd reading.\n\nYet what is called a \"horse\" in heaven would surely be called a \"dragon\" on earth. What is named the \"Heavenly Stables\" in heaven would surely be named the \"Dragon Taming Bureau\" on earth. Wukong asks: *\"No rank—does that mean it’s extremely high?\"* The crowd replies: *\"It’s called ‘Unranked.’\"* What is \"unranked\" in heaven becomes the highest rank when viewed from the earthly realm. Why then does Wukong say: *\"I won’t do it, I won’t do it\"*? In ancient times, Emperor Yao sought to yield the world to Xu You and Chao Fu, who washed their ears to cleanse the taint of such an offer. How could one as great as Wukong willingly remain in the post of Heavenly Stablemaster?\n\nWith a sudden crash, he overturns his seat, draws out his treasure, and smashes his way out of the stables, heading straight for the Southern Gate of Heaven. What resolute transcendence! Unaware, his heart ignites with fury, his mind seething with indignation—this reveals that to assign the office of stablemaster to one who steers kalpas is a fundamental contradiction, utterly impossible. The fire in his heart, the rage in his mind, arise from the natural effulgence of his golden light. Annotators again mistake this for \"scattered thoughts and wild intentions.\" But in the radiant presence of the Heavenly Emperor, could one with scattered thoughts and wild intentions roam freely, unchecked and unchallenged?\n\nPurple Yang the Perfected says: *\"Swallow a grain of the Golden Elixir, and you will know your fate is not ruled by heaven.\"* The ancestral master Wei Boyang says: *\"Heaven and earth, gods and spirits, cannot be fathomed. Use them to secure your body, conceal your form, and hide.\"* The forms, images, and numbers of heaven and earth are known to all. But the mechanisms of divine concealment and ghostly stealth remain beyond human comprehension. Only the sage knows that essence becomes things and wandering souls transform. Thus, understanding the conditions of ghosts and spirits, he masters their utility and secures his body. The cosmos rests in his hand; creation arises from his heart. He emerges from being and enters non-being, his presence and absence unfathomable. Knowing this, one understands that the great sage’s descent to earth and ascent to heaven are matters of true intent and real application, not subject to heaven’s constraints.\n\nThus, the Single-Horned Demon King pledges allegiance to him. A king with a single horn is a sovereign. The offering of the cinnabar-yellow robe symbolizes the principle of *\"yellow at the center, penetrating all patterns.\"* Urging him to proclaim himself the Great Sage Equal of Heaven and raise his banner is to declare that authority rests with him, not heaven. The robe is yellow with a cinnabar hue—surpassing red, it embodies the meaning of *\"Yang at its apex.\"* A king who rules himself is lofty indeed.\n\nHerein lies the image of the Ascendant Dragon. Though it has subdued the root of future chaos and rebellion, when the Jade Emperor appointed Li Tianwang as the Great Marshal to Subdue Demons, seeking to capture and tame the Great Sage, he failed to examine the origins of his nurturance or the subtleties of his cultivation. Instead, he mistook the Great Sage for a demon—no wonder he could not subdue him.\n\nThus, when the Giant Spirit Deity struck once and fled, and Nezha struck once and fled, how could it be strange that one whose sageliness was whole triumphed over the lesser denizens of heaven? That the Giant Spirit fled without a fight was only fitting. Yet when Nezha transformed—sprouting three heads, six arms, and ten thousand thousand forms—this was the three horizontal lines of *Qian*, the image of myriad transformations following nature. The Great Sage likewise transformed—three heads, six arms, ten thousand thousand forms—also the three horizontal lines of *Qian*, the image of myriad transformations following nature. Their forms were equal, their strength matched.\n\nWhy, then, did the Great Sage pluck a single hair, reveal his original form, and strike Nezha’s left shoulder from behind, sending him fleeing? For Nezha stood first, as the lower three lines of *Qian*, while the Great Sage stood after, as the upper three lines of *Qian*. At the apex of pure Yang, it must transform and return to the first line, breaking its rigidity—was this not the plucking of a single hair to reveal his original form, striking from behind to wound the left shoulder?\n\nHeaven mistook the Great Sage for a demon, taking truth for falsehood, and thus the Six Demons proclaimed themselves sages, inverting falsehood as truth. Not only could it not subdue the sage, but it could not even subdue demons. Heaven, seeing the sage as a demon, could not subdue a single demon; the sage, seeing demons as sages, could subdue a host of sages. All later subduals of a thousand demons and ten thousand monsters stemmed from this. His capacity had long since encompassed what lay beyond heaven—how could the empty title of \"Equal of Heaven\" bind him?\n\nWhen the Heavenly King’s son returned to report and request troops, the Jade Emperor, astonished by his words, still deemed them mad and sought to execute him. This was precisely what the Buddha had foretold: *\"All the hosts of heaven shall be struck with doubt.\"* The Star of Venus then memorialized, \"Fearing we cannot subdue him at once, I beg to appoint him as the Great Sage Equal of Heaven, to curb his wayward heart.\" The Jade Emperor assented and issued the decree, as if heaven could thus indulge the sage.\n\nYet indulging the sage while failing to subdue him arose from the misguided attempt to \"curb his wayward heart.\" For if Wukong were not a sage, he could not be indulged; once indulged as a sage, how could his \"waywardness\" be removed? To call it waywardness while indulging it was to indulge the waywardness itself—how could this lead to subjugation? The later chaos in the Peach Orchard was not Wukong’s doing, but the result of the Jade Emperor and the Golden Star indulging him to create disorder. What intent did Wukong have? When he saw the peaches, he ate them—what else could he do but follow the sage’s or the demon’s nature as it arose?\n\nThe Jade Emperor said, \"Wukong, come forth. I now proclaim you the Great Sage Equal of Heaven.\" The rank was supreme. Yet what the Jade Emperor deemed the highest office, Wukong merely acknowledged with a bow, no different from his time as Keeper of the Heavenly Stables. He did not regard the title of Great Sage Equal of Heaven as the ultimate rank, for his greatness was self-proclaimed, his equality with heaven self-declared—it was not the emperor who made him great or equal. Since he had already made himself great and equal, how could one prevent him from being so? And how could one make him content or at peace?\n\nThe establishment of two empty offices was of no benefit—it only served to oversee his discontent and his incompleteness.\n\nWukuyi said: This reveals the Dao of heaven where things reach their extreme and must reverse—a mechanism beyond the ken of ghosts and spirits, the natural operation of the primordial True Unity’s qi, not something the Great Sage could claim as his own design. The immortal master merely borrows names and images to depict its wonder. Those who mistake this for a mere \"monkey of the mind\" take it as a display of literary skill, while those who fail to grasp the principle see it as mere stylistic variation—how far they stray from the truth by a hair’s breadth!\n\nThe Great Sage established himself in rectitude, matching heaven in name—this is the ninth line of Qian, the image of the ascendant dragon. When yang reaches its extreme, it must reverse: such is the natural principle. How could the Great Sage truly reverse it? How could the Heavenly Palace truly be overturned? The Heavenly Palace is Qian as heaven, the palace of the ninth line—could the Great Sage truly reverse it? Yet reversal must begin with disorder, and disorder must have its cause and occasion.\n\nWhy does the text speak of the \"monkey of the mind\" running wild, conjuring these illusions, weaving clusters of literary flowers merely to dazzle the eyes and mind? The Palace of Equality with Heaven stands to the right of the Peach Orchard, so the orchard must lie to the left. The Dao of heaven turns leftward. The Great Sage dwells at the pinnacle of pure yang, yang within yang—his qi shifts from warmth to heat, the time when the myriad things flourish, when yang reaches its extreme and becomes ascendant.\n\nAt the summer solstice, a single yin is born, yet its force cannot reverse into yin; instead, it turns leftward toward the Peach Orchard. The left side is the Green Dragon, belonging to wood, hence the peach—this is the idle provocation of a true person. The Jade Emperor’s authority over the peaches is the inevitable course of qi’s movement, not something the Great Sage could control.\n\nThose who doubt may ask: If the Great Sage has attained the primordial Dao, mastering yin and yang without being manipulated by them, why can he not control himself from reversing? They do not understand that the primordial Dao moves both in accord and in opposition. The primordial Dao is opposed in its embodiment, reversing yin into yang, becoming sage, immortal, or buddha. Yet humans, creatures, demons, and ghosts follow its accord, as do the earth, the netherworld, and even the heavenly gods. To embody opposition while employing accord—this is how opposition gives rise to accord. This is what is meant by \"the primordial Dao, which heaven does not defy,\" and \"using the nine without being used by it.\"\n\nWhen the primordial Dao is employed in accord, it reverses yang into yin, becoming human, creature, ghost, or demon. Then the gods oppose it, the heavens oppose it, and even the buddhas and immortals oppose it. To embody accord while employing opposition—this is how accord gives rise to opposition. This is what is meant by \"the later heaven following heaven’s timing,\" and \"using the six without being used by it.\" Master Cheng said: \"The mind connects with what precedes heaven, yet its application must follow the later heaven; affairs align with what follows heaven, yet their understanding must precede heaven.\"\n\nThe *Wenyan* states: \"Who but the sage knows advance and retreat, life and death, without losing correctness?\" This rebellion in the Heavenly Palace precisely illustrates the Great Sage’s masterful employment of the primordial Dao in accord. The Peach Orchard is the emergence of the emperor from Zhen within the Kun palace. The three thousand six hundred trees correspond to the six sixes of thirty-six in the Kun palace. The first twelve hundred trees are the two sixes of twelve in Kun’s initial two lines—this is the lower vehicle. The three thousand years for their ripening signify the lesser attainment.\n\nThe middle twelve hundred trees are the two sixes of twelve in Kun’s middle two lines—this is the middle vehicle. The last twelve hundred trees are the two sixes of twelve in Kun’s fifth and sixth lines—this is the higher vehicle. The ripened peaches are yang within yin. After this, visiting every three to five days: five days make a *hou*, fifteen days make a *qi*, and three times five is fifteen—this marks the descent of yin qi. Thus, the ripening of the peaches follows heaven’s movement.\n\nThe sudden scheme arises at the time when the yang body is about to transform. Removing his cap and robes is the image of *Bo* (Splitting) reaching its extreme. Eating his fill of ripe peaches: yang receives Kun’s yin qi, and yang gradually turns to yin. Returning to steal peaches after two or three days: two and three make five, another *hou*. The Queen Mother sends seven immortal maidens to pick peaches: the later hexagram *Gu* (Meeting) is when six yang lines encounter seven, bringing *Gu*—seven days complete *Gu*, hence the seven maidens.\n\nThe Great Sage transforms into a two-inch man, sleeping in the dense leaves atop a great tree—how wondrous! Green leaves form shade; two is a yin line, small is a yin image. Thus, the great becomes small, the odd becomes even, yang transforms into yin. Qian’s first line gains yin and becomes Xun. Sleeping marks the time when yang wanes and yin waxes. Following heaven in concealment is \"using the nine\" to \"see a flock of dragons without a head\"—employing hardness with softness, dwelling in ascendance yet concealing it in the beginning.\n\nThe lines \"Only the clothes and hat were missing, nowhere to be found\" and the like all carry profound meaning. The immortal maidens enter beneath the trees to pick peaches: yin gradually advances to strip yang. The first three baskets and the last three baskets—are these not \"three days before *jia* and three days after *jia*,\" simply the first three and the last three? From first to middle, from middle to last, only sparse flowers and fruit are seen, subtly alluding to the time of decline on Flower-Fruit Mountain.\n\nThe immortal maidens look east and west, seeing only on the southern branch a peach half-red, half-white. The green-clad maiden pulls down the branch, the red-clad maiden plucks it—such wondrous meanings cannot be fully expressed. The southern direction refers to the peach borne on the northern branch; half-red, half-white marks the moment of near-ripening.\n\nOnly this—what meets the eye alone. The green-clad maiden pulls down the branch: green, the true color of yin, inwardly yin yet outwardly yang. The red-clad maiden plucks it: red, the true color of yang, outwardly yin yet inwardly yang. As the branch is lifted upward, the Great Sage awakens abruptly, revealing his true form—this is an unlooked-for encounter, called *Gou*. Pure yang suddenly meets a single yin, the first advance of the feminine. *Gou* arises when heaven’s heart, through *Xun*, receives the first of *Kun* as earth.\n\nWang Yuanmei said: “When *Bo* descends into chaos, *Gou* arises; when *Gou* descends into chaos, there is no sorrow—only in *Bo* does one fear *Gou*.” For one yin harbors the ambition to contend with five yangs, its vigor truly formidable. Here lies the very origin of the calamity that would disrupt the Peach Banquet. The Great Sage, recognizing the onset of disaster, flies into a rage, exclaiming, “You’ve stolen my peaches!” To steal peaches is to pilfer the profound mechanism of heaven and earth, to rob the creative workings of yin and yang.\n\nYet when the immortal maidens speak of the Peach Banquet and the Queen Mother’s august decree, of the sages of east, west, south, north, and center—this is clearly the convergence of the Five Phases. And the Great Sage’s primordial qi is its sovereign lord. Perceiving the portent of *Gou*’s beginning, he turns wrath to joy, employing the art of immobilization: “Stay, stay, stay!”—this is *Gou*’s first six, “bound to the metal *ni*.” Like the *ni* that halts a chariot, fastened with metal’s unyielding strength, it arrests firmly to prevent further advance, lest the yielding way entangle him. Here the immortal master, in utmost compassion, has already revealed the wondrous subtlety of commencing the Golden Elixir.\n\nFrom this, the Great Sage leaps out of the peach garden and directly encounters the Barefoot Great Immortal—this is *Gou*’s first six, “the emaciated pig hesitates.” The pig delights in wood and hesitates, and though emaciated, it must leap and bound; one must prepare deeply, for its force cannot be easily stopped. Thus he devises a plan and transforms at once, assuming the guise of the Barefoot Great Immortal—this is *Bo*’s first six, “stripping the bed at the feet.” Bare feet signify *Bo*: yin is about to encroach upon the yang path, ascending from below.\n\nRushing toward Jasper Pool to return, no immortals appear, when suddenly a waft of wine fragrance reaches him. Exerting his divine power, he presses against the vats and jars, drinking to his heart’s content—this is *Gou*’s nine-two, “wrapping the fish, not reaching the guests.” Like a fisherman who arrives first, casting a net to catch all; those who come later, though skilled in fishing, cannot match him. Here *Xun* is the white cogon grass, the wrapped fish the beauty of yin things. Yet it is controlled early, lest it reach the assembled guests. In his drunken stupor, he mutters to himself, “Not good! Not good!”\n\n\"...\"\n\nWishing to return to his palace to sleep, he takes a wrong step and loses his way—this is *Gou*’s nine-three, “the buttocks stripped of skin, his gait halting and hesitant.” *Xun* is the thigh; three, occupying the upper position, is the buttocks. The first is resented by the second; three, isolated and without support, seeks an encounter in its ambition, thus finding no peace in its place and faltering in its steps. This is the image of being trapped between advance and retreat.\n\nProceeding to the Tushita Palace, he suddenly awakens to realization: all this time, he had come to seek this elder, yet upon entering, not a soul is to be seen—this is *Gou*’s nine-four, “the wrapped sack holds no fish; misfortune arises.” Four and the first should correspond and meet, but the first has already encountered the second, leaving four unfulfilled. Having lost its destined meeting, it is like a sack without fish—popular favor has departed. The separation is about to begin.\n\nEntering the Elixir Chamber, he sees five gourds, which contain refined golden elixir. Pouring it out, he drinks—this is *Gou*’s nine-five, “wrapping the melon with willow, containing inner radiance; there is a fall from heaven.” Willow grows in fertile soil, yet the wrapped melon remains uneaten. The willow’s binding of the melon is like the five yang forces restraining the initial yin—an effort doomed to collapse. Yet Heaven’s intent is still unfolding; one cannot contend by force. Only by concealing one’s brilliance, keeping inner power hidden, can the Mandate of Heaven be retrieved. The five gourds are the refined golden elixir—nine-five’s veiled radiance lies within, capable of reclaiming the Mandate. This is like a fall from heaven: what was not there suddenly appears. As I seek to consume the golden elixir to forge my destiny, Heaven bestows it freely. Here the immortal master reveals the principle of inner and outer golden elixirs, saving and delivering the world. The meaning of *Gou*’s time is vast indeed!\n\nIn an instant, Wukong sobers from his drunkenness, reflecting with unease, “Not good! If I alarm the Jade Emperor, my life will be forfeit. Flee! Flee!”\n\n\"Flee! Better to descend to the mortal realm and be a king!\" Without retracing his steps, he took the Western Gate of Heaven, using the art of invisibility to escape, returning to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. Ah! How wondrous! The world does not recognize the subtlety within these writings, mistaking Wukong’s violation of Heaven’s decrees as mere worldly flight—unaware that this is the Great Sage’s compliance with Heaven’s will in retreat. Ascending to Heaven and descending to the mountain is called the \"Heaven-Mountain Retreat.\" The Great Sage, knowing the excess of yang and turning toward *xun*, five yang suddenly encountering one yin becomes *gou*—*gou*’s perilous momentum cannot be curbed. It is the root of *xun*; the mechanism of retreat; the gradual onset of *pi*; the foundation of *bo*; the inception of *kun*. To fail to retreat at this juncture is to lack awareness of the moment. This retreat is to depart from excess and conceal oneself in the beginning. Thus, the Great Sage’s disruption of the Peach Banquet was not his doing—it was the work of the qi’s course; the immortal maidens’ plucking of the peaches was not the Queen Mother’s dispatch—it was the qi’s course that sent them. All is the doing of *gou*. Thus, the chapter most thoroughly embeds the meaning of *gou*. Knowing the fierce calamity of feminine yin, only by the Great Sage’s compliance in discerning it and opposition in restraining it can the great Dao of primordial Heaven be made clear. Those who critique *Journey to the West*, reducing the Great Sage’s disruption of the Peach Banquet and rebellion in Heaven’s Palace to mere depictions of deluded desires, do grievous wrong! How lamentable! The Great Sage, returning to the mountain to feast, somersaulted back in an instant using the art of invisibility, arriving at the Jasper Pool—where the guests remained unaware—seizing the four great jars and returning to his cave to hold a drinking assembly. Such is the way of stealth and vigilance, soaring in excess yet following the heart’s desire: meeting it, one sees not its head; following it, one sees not its tail. Left or right, all is fitting.\n\nThough the fermented brew had sown the seeds of chaos far and wide, it could still be silently shifted and subtly redirected. The two instances of \"art of invisibility\" in this passage precisely capture the unfathomable marvel of vanishing without a trace. When the Jade Emperor was informed and dispatched the Four Heavenly Kings with a hundred thousand celestial troops and eighteen layers of heavenly nets and earthly snares, the Great Sage paid them no heed—this is what is meant by \"cares and woes cannot burden him, arrows and snares cannot reach him.\" He flees in name yet does not flee in truth. Who but the Great Sage could abide in such ease and self-possession?\n\nThe Great Sage repelled the Nine Luminaries and laughed, saying, \"These deeds are indeed real—what do you intend to do now?\" For the Four Heavenly Kings and the Nine Luminaries are none other than the *nine in the fourth place* of the hexagram, all yang and unyielding. The Great Sage, embodying *\"fellowship with hidden weapons in the wilds,\"* dared not rise openly to advance, and thus could oppose the five yang lines without fear—this is the *nine in the third place* of *Fellowship*. When the *nine in the fourth place* clashed with the Great Sage, they fought from dawn till dusk; all the horned demons were captured, save for the Four Vigorous Ones who escaped. The horned demon corresponds to the *top yang of Coupling*—unyielding in the highest position. At that moment, its rigidity had no place to manifest, no position to encounter, and unlike the *nine in the fifth place* of *Fellowship*, which *\"contains brilliance and guards it,\"* it was seized. Yet the *nine in the fourth place* could not claim full victory, for it bore the image of *\"mounting the wall but failing to attack\"* in *Fellowship*. The Four Vigorous Ones and the Great Sage correspond to the *nine in the fifth place* of *Fellowship*. Amidst the five yang lines, the central and correct position finds resonance with the *two in the second place*, and thus they could cover the retreat. *\"First wailing, then laughing\"*—why first wail? The *two in the second place*, separated by the *three* and *four*, could not aid the *five*, hence the wailing, born of private attachment. Later, meeting the *five* unharmed, they laughed—this too was private sentiment.\n\nThe Great Sage said, \"Why fret? Just guard tightly, eat your fill, sleep soundly, and nurture your spirit.\" This is the *top yang of Fellowship*, *\"fellowship in the wilds,\"* where one’s aspirations remain unfulfilled. For the Great Sage harbored a will that spanned Heaven and Earth, yet the times were adverse, cutting him off from humanity and forcing him into reclusion—how pitiable! Reading the words *\"nurture your spirit,\"* my tears flow like rivers.\n\n**Chapter Six: Guanyin Attends the Banquet to Inquire of the Cause; The Little Sage Displays Might to Subdue the Great Sage**\n\nWu Yizi says: This elucidates the principle of the waxing and waning of yin and yang, the alternation of prosperity and decline, the great going and the small coming, shifting with the times. It reveals how the Great Sage’s unfathomable transformations, though compliant in their application, never stray from the primordial Dao of Heaven. The passage brims with boundless meaning, encompassing all without a single superfluous word. I know not how the immortal master, when setting brush to paper, could so effortlessly weave such a tapestry, every thread a truth. It is because his Dao had reached its apex, his mind like the vast emptiness, where the transformations of Heaven and humanity are mirrored in his writing. The shallow grasp its shallows, the profound its depths—all depends on the learner’s own attainment. Yet how lamentable that the world has never truly understood!\n\nGuanyin Bodhisattva appears throughout the text, and this passage serves as its guiding thread, revealing the marvel of divine insight. To *observe*—how profound its meaning! To observe is to manifest correctness to others, guiding them toward purity without self-assertion. As the *Book of Changes* says: *\"Great observation is above; compliant and yielding, it is central. Correctness is observed throughout the world.\"* And again: *\"Observe the Dao of Heaven, and the four seasons do not err. The sage establishes teaching through the divine Dao, and the world submits.\"* Below, there is the wish to observe oneself and the people; above, there is no ruler who establishes teaching through the divine Dao. Above, there is the virtue of observing oneself and the people; below, there is the crudeness of childish observation and admonition—this is not divine observation. Divine observation employs yin without revealing it to others, and thus it stands above compliance, worthy of the name *Great Observation*. Why? The Dao of observation is the Dao of Heaven. To observe Heaven’s divine Dao is to silently and subtly operate, teaching through the manifest to reveal the divine—not revealing the divine through teaching. This is the unmanifest power of the divine.\n\nThus, Guanyin Bodhisattva arrives at the moment when yang wanes and yin waxes, establishing teaching through the divine Dao so that the world submits. Guanyin Bodhisattva is *Great Observation*; attending the banquet is *temporal observation*; inquiring of the cause is *divine observation*. Seeing the banquet in disarray, though celestial immortals were present, none took their seats—this was the gathering of yang’s waning and yin’s waxing. Commanding Hui’an to scout the military situation was the pivotal moment of divine observation. Here, the immortal master first sets forth the image of the *Ding* hexagram, laying the groundwork for the Great Sage’s eventual submission.\n\nThe *Ding* cauldron has fire above and wood below, used for cooking and offering to the Supreme Emperor and the sages. The Peach Banquet was such an offering. Yet the Great Sage, though a sage, was not present—this was a failure to partake in the offering, leading to chaos. Was this not a loss of the proper balance and transformation in cooking? This Peach Banquet was a gathering of yin’s ascendancy and yang’s decline. Who but the divine observer, Guanyin Bodhisattva, could discern the cause of this ebb and flow? The trend was inevitable: yin would advance further, and yang would wane further. It was a gathering of *Adversity*, where yang would soon be stripped away. The times compelled it, yet not entirely—ah! The immortal master’s subtle admonition to the world is profound indeed!\n\nFor the *Ding* cauldron embodies the secret essence of the Golden Elixir, and thus the immortal master dared not speak of it plainly, instead setting forth this symbol to await the discernment of later generations. He specifically invoked Guanyin’s joined palms in a single offering to reveal the marvelous function of divine observation—knowing that yin was growing while yang was waning, just as petty men advance while noble men retreat, as at the mouth of the Guan River in Guanzhou.\n\nThe *Book of Songs* says: *“The old man pours and pours,”* and the following line reads: *“The young lad prances and prances.”* The “young lad” is yin, and he dwells at the mouth of the Guan River. The Manifestly Sage Erlang, True Lord, is the second line of *Kun*’s hexagram. *Kun*’s yin, moving in accord with Heaven, follows a path of radiant display, its power compliant and unfailingly advantageous. At this moment, for the Great Sage, what came before was *Gou* and *Dun*; what followed would be *Pi* and *Bo*.\n\nThe six brothers are the six yin lines; the twelve hundred grass-headed spirits are the two sixes that make twelve. The first and second lines show petty men joining ranks to advance, like *“pulling the creeping grass, each after its kind.”* The grass-soldiers form a *Cui* hexagram, an image of thronging and surging abundance. That they *“heed commands but not proclamations”* reveals their insubordinate nature. The divine troops, leading hawks and hounds, appear as nothing but hawks and hounds. The True Lord laughed and said, *“This little sage has come,”* clearly declaring his smallness.\n\nYet one must contend with him in transformations—how subtle is the meaning of *transformation*! The *Book of Changes* says: *“In *Bo*, the yielding transforms into the firm.”* If yin strips away yang, why speak of *transformation*? Generally, when noble men expel petty men, they denounce their crimes before the royal court and cast them out without hesitation. Thus in the *Guai* hexagram, five yang lines expel one yin, and it is called *Guai*. When petty men expel noble men, their reasoning is unjust and their words unrighteous. They cause yang to dwindle day by day without realizing it is changing, revealing the cunning of their schemes. The subsequent *“one transformation, two transformations, three transformations, four transformations”* are all part of their art.\n\nThe Little Sage then said: *“Gentlemen, with your heavenly nets and earthly snares, do not cover the space above.”* Generally, when petty men harm noble men, they first allow them freedom to roam, then secretly exploit their vulnerabilities, leaving no trace. Such is the venom of their plots. The passage where the six brothers are ordered to restrain the hawks and hounds, with their laughter and gestures, vividly portrays the demeanor of petty men. The Great Sage, seeing this, asked with a grin about their origins. Once their roots were revealed, he knew their yin-like adaptability and mutability.\n\nErlang shook himself and transformed, towering ten thousand *zhang* tall, brandishing the Three-Pointed, Two-Edged Divine Blade in both hands. The second transformation completes the *Kun* hexagram. *Kun*’s yin moves in accord with Heaven, its power and flame filling the sky—this is the natural course of events. Why raise the Three-Pointed, Two-Edged Divine Blade? The word *“point”* clearly signifies a petty man, while the *“two edges”* resemble two lips. It shows a heart without mercy but wielding a weapon of slaughter. With green face and fanged teeth, crimson hair—is this not a ravenous demon? Though the Great Sage’s upright *qi* fills Heaven and Earth, capable of resistance, how could he contend with the grass-headed hawks and hounds rising in pursuit, startling his wings into retreat!\n\nThe Great Sage, sensing the great calamity had begun, concealed his golden-hooped staff in his ear and transformed into a sparrow, alighting and perching on a treetop. This mirrors the first line of *Ming Yi*: *“In *Ming Yi*, it flies, its wings drooping.”*\n\nFor it coiled its brilliance, feigning no lofty flight; it concealed its tracks, lest its flight be seen. The six brothers raised a clamor together—how fearful it is when petty men, having gained power, bark in unison! Erlang’s phoenix eyes widened into circles—why such widening? For in ordinary times, he feigned restraint, but in haste, his ferocity was fully exposed. Transforming into a starving hawk, he spread his wings to strike—was this not reliance on the sharpness of talons and beak? The Great Sage became a great *ci* vulture, soaring into the sky, which is the line of *Ming Yi*’s six in the fourth place: *“Entering the left belly, one obtains the heart of *Ming Yi* upon exiting the gate.”* For when concealment among the near is no longer possible, one may yet enter the hidden recesses of the left belly. By upholding the virtue of humility and compliance, one attains the heart of *Ming Yi*, exiting the gate to flee far away. The *ci* vulture demonstrates humility and righteousness. Erlang swiftly transformed into a great crane, darting into the clouds to peck—still employing his beak.\n\nThe Great Sage plunged into the stream and became a fish, reaching the utmost in concealment. Erlang transformed into an osprey, resembling yet not resembling a green kite—this was a disguise; resembling yet not resembling a heron—this was a private bribe; resembling yet not resembling an old stork—this was feigning age. The Great Sage flicked his tail and fled, resembling yet not resembling a carp—this was following principle; resembling yet not resembling a mandarin fish—this was noble integrity; resembling yet not resembling a black fish—this was true purity; resembling yet not resembling a bream—this was inner rectitude. Erlang lunged forward to peck once more—still using his beak. The Great Sage became a water snake, slithering into the grass, neither viper nor serpent—concealed in the wild thickets. Erlang transformed into a gray crane, stretching forth a long beak like a pair of sharp-tipped iron pincers. Alas!\n\nErlang ever wielded his beak—yet it was in the end most fearsome. The Immortal Master’s brush, arriving here, unwittingly sets one’s whole body dripping with sweat.\n\nThe Great Sage next transformed into a bustard, a creature that thrives in flocks, keeps its ranks, and lives in company without cliques. Erlang, companion to hawks and crows, ought to have welcomed the flock and averted danger—yet he loathed the bustard’s association with phoenixes as a disgrace, and at once nocked his pellet-bow to strike, revealing how the upright and the crooked cannot coexist. But why did he not transform, instead resorting to the bow? In general, when petty men despise gentlemen, they seldom provoke trouble themselves but incite others to strike with pellets and bring harm. In seeming non-transformation lies the most extreme transformation.\n\nThe Great Sage seized the moment, rolled down the cliff, and transformed into a village shrine. This transformation’s subtlety, its hidden meaning, eludes the world’s understanding. Some critics praise it as the alchemy of prose; others mock it as a “monkey-headed shrine,” and for centuries none have glimpsed its depths. Truly, the Great Sage’s shrine-transformation is such that few can fathom its rarity.\n\nWhy did the Great Sage not transform into something else but chose instead a shrine so manifestly impossible to conceal? And why, of all places to flee, did he transform into Erlang and enter the very shrine he could not enter? The meaning is already plain and evident. To grasp it, one must read the *Hexagram Bo*’s top line: *“The great fruit is not eaten; the gentleman carries it away, while the petty man strips the hut.”*\n\nAt that moment, the Great Sage had no path to heaven, no gate to earth; steadfast in tribulation, all yang had dissolved, only the topmost line remained. The gentleman above shelters the host of yin, like a hut. Should the stripping reach its limit and consume the fruit, he would lose his own shelter. In the end, stripping yang is self-stripping. Thus the Great Sage transformed into a hut-like shrine to halt the stripping, then transformed into Erlang to merge with him, then entered Erlang’s shrine to show that the Great Sage’s shrine was Erlang’s shrine, and Erlang’s shrine was the Great Sage’s shrine—thereby making it clear. Hence the words: *“Sir, do not clamor—the shrine now bears the surname Sun.”* To strip Sun’s hut is to strip Yang’s hut; Yang’s hut is Sun’s hut. Thus the great fruit warns petty men not to consume it, and one should follow the times and halt.\n\nYet the tail was difficult to conceal, standing erect behind as a flagpole—another layer of subtlety. When gentlemen evade peril and withdraw from the world, it is better to act first than last. If all others go first and I alone lag behind, I miss the moment and court disaster. Thus to vanish without a trace is the ultimate withdrawal. To withdraw with the tail exposed leaves traces for prying eyes. Hence the *Hexagram Dun*’s first line: *“Withdrawal with the tail—danger.”* The Great Sage, at the *Hexagram Gou*, withdrew in accordance with heaven’s Dao of concealment, yet even so could not escape the peril of tail-withdrawal. Who recognizes the danger of tail-withdrawal?\n\nThe Immortal Master specifically uses the tail to illustrate the peril of tail-withdrawal. Yet withdrawal must not expose the tail, and stripping must not reach the tail. Now Erlang’s stripping has reached its peak above, even touching the tail—he should be warned to halt swiftly and turn back.\n\nThe Great Sage’s mouth became the shrine’s gate, fit for offerings but not for pursuit; his teeth became the door leaves, venerable and indestructible; his tongue became the bodhisattva, manifesting from compassion; his eyes became the window lattice, veiling brilliance with obscurity. Erlang sought first to smash the lattice, then to kick in the door leaves—envying its clarity and clamping its mouth shut.\n\nThe Great Sage was then in his tiger-transformation, yet the crowd instead raised the demon-revealing mirror, bowing humbly and spitting out slanderous words—an age-old pattern, nothing strange. The episode where he summons Li Hu and Zhang Long vividly portrays the postures of bribery and gluttony; such is the Immortal Master’s artistry in exposition.\n\nYet the crux lies solely in the Great Sage’s *observing and advancing*, and the Little Sage’s *stripping and coming*. What comes constitutes what goes; what is small constitutes what is great; observation is what constitutes stripping. Thus the sage looks up to observe the patterns of heaven, looks down to examine the principles of earth. Tracing origins and returning to endings, he knows the discourse of life and death. With spirit he knows the future; with knowledge he stores the past—thus he illuminates transformations and practices the workings of ghosts and spirits.\n\nThose of old who skillfully managed petty men always followed the momentum of their expansion, remained still outside affairs, and gradually halted their advance. Thus the *Book of Changes* says: *“Follow and halt them—this is observing the image.”* In the time of stripping, follow and halt to observe heaven’s waxing and waning, the fullness of yin and the emptiness of yang. The gentleman follows heaven’s course and halts. He does not dare to be rigidly upright: following is how he halts, and halting is how he acts. Stripping does not advance; in *Fu*, advancing is favorable—there is no second way. The great fruit is not eaten—this is halting. Why is it not eaten? The fruit is yang. Yang cannot be stripped and advanced by yin; thus when stripping reaches its limit, it turns to *Fu*. Petty men lose their shelter and also follow the times to halt.\n\nThis is why Guanyin deploys Erlang: precisely to observe heaven’s course and follow its expanding momentum to gradually observe its halting—not to aid yin in dissolving yang. She does not use the pure vase to strike the Great Sage but has Laozi use the diamond chisel: precisely to remain still outside affairs, follow heaven’s course, and halt the stripping—to halt yin and rescue yang.\n\nYet stripping and halting are both heaven’s course. Following its stripping and halting it are both observing heaven’s course. In truth, the Great Sage’s observation is his own observation, merely borrowing Guanyin to expound the principle; his halting is his own halting, merely borrowing Laozi to reveal the meaning; his stripping is his own stripping, merely borrowing Erlang to follow its course. In truth, the stripping is not the Great Sage’s own stripping—he merely borrows the Great Sage to clarify heaven’s Dao of stripping.\n\nTo reproach others is to have each strip themselves as warning of their peril. Knowing the stripping and following its halt, knowing the following of its halt and its necessary return, knowing its necessary return—thus the Dao is made clear.\n\nGuanyin pressed her palms together and said, “This humble monk requests that Your Majesty accompany the Dao Ancestor to the Southern Gate of Heaven to see for yourselves the truth of the matter.” This is precisely to observe the truth of heaven’s Dao in yin and yang. The Two Sages encircled the Great Sage but had yet to capture him—“the great fruit remains uneaten.” The pure vase was not used, preserving its immaculate clarity so that the body does not engage, a divine observation.\n\nThe Bodhisattva asked Laozi, “What weapons do you have?” Laozi replied, “I have, I have, I have.” From his left arm he took down a ring, called the *Diamond Chisel*, also named the *Diamond Noose*. This is the “golden hook” and “jade hook” of the *Ding* hexagram’s sixth line, fifth and top lines. The subtlety lies in the threefold “I have, I have, I have.” For the *Ding*’s fifth line, the hollow center is yellow, representing the ruler as solid. The fifth is empty, taking the second line’s solidity as its own solidity—thus Guanyin asks from her emptiness, and Laozi answers from his fullness.\n\nAll things move by their feet, but the *Ding* alone moves by its ears. The sixth line’s hollow center is virtue, forming the yellow ear-hook. Adding ears responds to the second line’s firm hardness. Like threading with a golden hook, it must remain consistent from beginning to end. In steadfastness, it is beneficial—thus solid yet hollow, hollow yet round, forming a ring. The top line’s jade hook, with yang on the left residing in yin, hard yet yielding, is tempered like jade, warm yet solemn. Thus, from the left arm comes the *Diamond Chisel*, gold conjoined with jade.\n\nWhy can it noose all things and be called a noose? The fifth line is hollow at its center, and emptiness can contain. The top is the elder, the fifth the ruler—thus it is Laozi. Only Laozi’s emptiness within and solidity without can subdue the upright and halt change. Erlang could not consume the Great Sage’s fruit, but the Great Sage could consume Laozi’s center, striking his heavenly crown and stumbling. Laozi’s following and halting is the Great Sage’s own following and halting. The hound’s bite sent him sprawling again—Erlang’s following and halting is the Great Sage’s own following and halting. The hound is *xu* (the dog), the eleventh earthly branch. The hexagram of the ninth month has *kun* within and *gen* without, following the season to halt. To act against the season is to halt in motion; to follow the season in halting is to move in stillness. The Great Sage’s entrapment and halt is precisely his own halting and movement.\n\nThe Seven Sages are the seven yin lines returning from *fu*. Piercing the *pipa* bones so he could no longer transform—this is the *Bo* hexagram. Halting the top line so the great fruit remains uneaten preserves the yang within the fruit to turn and restore *Kai Tai*. It halts where it cannot but halt. The halting without change is the Great Sage’s wondrous use of the primordial, not Erlang’s ability to pierce and restrain him.\n\nThose who study the Dao and can observe its subtleties, who can establish themselves in the formless and wordless, embody Guanyin’s divine marvel—acting in yin without revealing it to others. In observation, the meaning is vast indeed!\n\nThe Immortal Master used the Great Sage and Lesser Sage to elucidate the Dao of the Golden Elixir, while I, with the Confucian Dao, elucidate the Lesser Sage and Great Sage, though I have not exhausted its wonders. I cannot but conclude: the Lesser Sage follows heaven and embodies *kun* yin. Viewed through the primordial Dao, in the later heaven it is the male. The Great Sage defies heaven and embodies *qian* yang. Viewed through the primordial Dao, in the later heaven it is the female. To follow heaven is to rebel against the Heavenly Palace; to punish rebellion is to embrace yin softness. Laozi, as the master of harmony, instead aids yin in restraining yang—the Golden Elixir operates in reversal. Thus, how can I speak of its wonders? I merely observe.\n\n**Chapter Seven: The Great Sage Escapes the Eight-Trigrams Furnace; The Mind-Ape is Tamed Beneath the Five Elements Mountain**\n\nWu Yizi said: This concludes the preceding discussion of the primordial True Unity’s *qi*, which arises from Nonbeing into Being, from Being returns to Nonbeing, from Nonbeing once more emerges, and from this re-emergence attains Supreme Harmony. Supreme Harmony gives rise to *Qian*, *Qian* to *Gou*, *Gou* to *Pi*, *Pi* to *Kun*, and *Kun* to *Fu*—endlessly cycling, beginning anew, enduring through ten thousand kalpas.\n\nThe primordial is refined within the later heaven; the later heaven conceals the marvels of the primordial. The Immortal Master revealed these truths to the world through the later heaven’s Eight Trigrams and Five Phases, that people might observe, awaken, and cultivate this singular *qi* to transcend birth and death.\n\nThe Ancestor of Unity is Nonbeing; Nonbeing generates the One, and the One extends to Ten. The sequence of yin-yang circulation—One, Two, Three, Four, Five—is the true reckoning. Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten are but their complements. The reckoning culminates at Five, yet Five resides within One, Two, Three, Four; Three and Four reside within Two; and Two resides within One. Grasp the One, and the hundred follow; perform ten thousand virtues, yet never depart from the One. The hundred, thousand, myriad, and billion never stray from One or Five.\n\nSpeaking of the numerical flow of the Five Phases: Heaven-One, Earth-Two; Heaven-Three, Earth-Four; Heaven-Five, Earth-Six; Heaven-Seven, Earth-Eight; Heaven-Nine, Earth-Ten. Speaking of the paired reckoning of yin and yang: *Qian*-One, *Dui*-Two, *Li*-Three, *Zhen*-Four, *Xun*-Five, *Kan*-Six, *Gen*-Seven, *Kun*-Eight—none depart from the Supreme Ultimate. Thus, doubling them yields the sixty-four hexagrams; applying them to affairs yields the three hundred eighty-four lines; accumulating them, all things arise. The number one thousand five hundred twenty remains bound to the Eight Trigrams; the Eight Trigrams to the Five Phases; the Five Phases to yin and yang; yin and yang to the Supreme Ultimate; and the Supreme Ultimate to Nonbeing. Thus, the Eight Trigrams and Five Phases are ultimately One. The Immortal Master speaks of both, each bearing profound meaning.\n\nWhen he speaks of the Eight Trigrams, it is that cultivators may observe their roots within the paired trigrams—just as I, in the opening chapter, presented a diagram to verify the Dao. The Immortal Master long ago made this clear. Let us first clarify the purport of the Great Sage’s escape from the furnace.\n\nIn the elixir practice, there is the tripod and the furnace: the upper is the tripod, the lower the furnace. The meaning of the tripod was subtly indicated by the Immortal Master in the preceding chapter, lifting the word “observe” to prompt discernment—not through convoluted spirits and gods, nor can its marvels be fathomed. The meaning of the furnace likewise cannot be fathomed through such convolutions. For within the later heaven’s Eight Trigrams lies the primordial *qi*. The Great Sage, with divine insight, grasped its firing times.\n\nLord Lao, wielding the Central Yellow of the tripod, struck the Great Sage’s primordial spirit to subdue him, relying on Erlang’s true earth and the hound’s steadfastness—like an eagle seizing a hare. Yet without the refining fire’s work, he could not be fully subdued. Nor could ordinary fire or the fire and thunder deities’ flames forcibly tame him; only the true fire of the Eight-Trigrams Furnace could refine him into elixir. As the Perfected One of Purple Yang said: *“There is a natural true firing time—what need for kindling or bellows?”* Thus, the deities of the fire and thunder departments could not harm him; only Lord Lao could lead him away, cast him into the Eight-Trigrams Furnace, and refine the elixir with civil and martial fire.\n\nThe Great Sage, entering the furnace, burrowed beneath the *Xun* palace. *Xun* is the eldest daughter, the way of softness—manifesting the image of King Wen imprisoned in Youli. Only through yielding compliance could he unfold the primordial Eight Trigrams, ultimately unharmed. Wind stirred the smoke, scorching his eyes red—yet this revealed injury, while concealing brilliance nurtured obscurity, rightly employing clarity without harm. Hence it is said: *“Later called ‘fiery eyes and golden pupils.’”*\n\nWhen the firing time was complete, the furnace was opened to retrieve the elixir. Suddenly, a sound arose from the furnace’s head, light blazed forth, and with a crash, the Eight-Trigrams Furnace was overturned. The Great Sage bolted outward like a white-browed tiger or a one-horned dragon—these two images of dragon and tiger now united as one. Lord Lao tumbled headfirst, barely escaping. Alas!\n\nMarvelous, wondrous indeed! Earlier, Lord Lao struck the Great Sage’s Heavenly Crown with the crucible’s handle, causing him to stumble; now, Lord Lao tumbled headfirst while the Great Sage broke free. The former was the Golden Elixir’s compliance within the crucible to form the embryo; this is the Golden Elixir’s reversal from the furnace to cast off the embryo. The immortal master’s verse, *“The Primordial Body perfectly accords with the Prior Heaven,”* precisely depicts the marvel of elixir completion—each word a pearl of wisdom. The most crucial points of discernment lie in the phrases *“styled the First Mystery,”* *“not lead and mercury,”* and *“returning to transformation.”* For the mystery within the Mystery defies exhaustive speech. This is called *“styled the First Mystery,”* yet there remains something beyond; *“not lead and mercury,”* yet lead and mercury are still required. This is said to *“return to transformation,”* yet further transformation remains.\n\nLaozi said: *“Mystery upon mystery—the gateway to all wonders.”* The first Mystery is already so intricate as to elude comprehension, and the second Mystery is even more so. Thus, the immortal master particularly emphasizes the phrase *“greatly disturbing the Heavenly Palace.”* Another verse contains two *“again”*s, precisely capturing the essence of *“Mystery upon Mystery.”* Why, then, did he once more wreak havoc in the Heavenly Palace? When the Prior Heaven’s true *yi*-essence enters the Eight Trigrams, it follows the timing of the Posterior Heaven; when it emerges beyond the Eight Trigrams, it precedes Heaven, and Heaven cannot oppose it. It contends with Heaven for its seat, unbound by Heaven’s dominion.\n\nEarlier, the Great Sage’s disturbance of the Heavenly Palace led to his tempering within the furnace—first movement, then stillness, the initial phase of the work. This is the first Mystery. Now, the Great Sage’s renewed disturbance of the Heavenly Palace, followed by his confinement beneath the mountain, is stillness at its extreme giving rise to movement, and movement returning to stillness—the latter phase of the work. This is the Mystery upon Mystery. Yet while the first disturbance could be subdued by Lord Lao’s crucible, this one could only be quelled by Tathāgata’s palm. The former relied on the oppositional Eight Trigrams, the latter on the clustered Five Phases; though their methods of restraint differ, their wondrous function is one.\n\nMost marvelous are the four lines of another verse. Readers must understand: the ape is paired with the heart, the heart is the ape—tightly bound and securely tethered, allowing no external pursuit. Thus, commentators on *Journey to the West* encapsulate the entire book with the four characters *“heart-ape, intent-horse,”* unaware that the ape is the Dao-body. The ape’s nature is slow, governing stillness; the monkey’s nature is restless, governing movement. This illustrates the Dao-body’s alternation between movement and stillness, corresponding to the human heart’s alternation between movement and stillness—not that the ape and monkey *are* the human heart. When the immortal master’s outline speaks of the *“heart-ape,”* saying the heart is the ape or monkey, the meaning is profound and demands the reader’s discernment.\n\nIf the heart is simply the ape or monkey, the expression is plain and shallow—why then the phrase *“profound meaning”*? For the Dao-body has stillness and movement, and the cultivator likewise has stillness and movement. Movement at its extreme must return to stillness, stillness at its extreme must give rise to movement, and movement at its extreme must return to stillness. The entire process of the Golden Elixir is contained herein—this is *“Mystery upon mystery, the gateway to all wonders.”* Hence, it is called *“profound meaning.”*\n\nWhy does the third line speak of uniting movement with stillness without mentioning the ape’s heart uniting with intent, but only the heart? Because in the Golden Elixir’s work, at the moment when stillness at its extreme gives rise to movement, one must subdue the monkey’s movement and pacify the ape’s stillness to accomplish the Great Dao. Thus, before the horse and ape unite, before heart and intent harmonize, one cannot be tightly bound and securely tethered but must be guided externally. Only when horse and ape unite, when heart and intent harmonize, can one be tightly bound and securely tethered, allowing no external pursuit.\n\nThe Great Sage’s transformation into three heads and six arms, dancing within the core, enduring through all ages, and eluding the grasp of divine generals—this precisely depicts the marvel of the Dao-body’s transformations. Those who interpret this as concerning the heart err greatly. Yet the Dao is no ordinary Dao; those who cultivate and subdue it become Tathāgatas. One must thoroughly investigate its origins before proceeding.\n\nThe Great Sage himself declared his spirit’s primordial root-source as the essence of the Prior Heaven, no mundane thing—this alone emboldened him to contend for precedence. In a single phrase, he revealed that while Heaven is of the Prior Heaven, so too is he. Thus, he dared to contend for precedence without yielding.\n\nWhen the Great Sage was lured into submission, it was precisely the moment for the Golden Elixir’s inception. The five fleshy pillars and a wisp of azure *qi* corresponded to the time when heart and intent clustered the Five Phases. The inscription *“The Great Sage Equaling Heaven was here”* on the central pillar is what the Buddha referred to as: *“Within the cosmos, between heaven and earth, there lies a precious secret in the mountain of form—not in the heart or kidneys, but in the mysterious pass of the single aperture.”* Thus, he could not escape Tathāgata’s palm and remained within the Five Phases.\n\nWhen the Buddha flipped his palm and thrust him beyond the Western Heaven’s gate, transforming the Five Phases Mountain to press him down, he clearly demonstrated that the path of the Golden Elixir must cluster the Five Phases to crystallize from emptiness. The human heart, attaining this alignment, gains a foundation and does not fall into oblivion. As *The Great Learning* states: *“Know where to rest, and you will be settled; settled, you will be tranquil; tranquil, you will be at peace; at peace, you may act without striving, gradually refining and transcending.”* The chapter’s subjugation of the demonic monkey and the grand assembly to pacify Heaven precisely embodies the principle of settled tranquility and peace.\n\n*The Awakening to Reality* says:\n*“Swallowing saliva and absorbing qi are human practices,\nOnly with substance can transformation arise.\nIf the crucible lacks the true seed,\nIt is like boiling water and fire in an empty cauldron.”*\nThe Great Sage is the true seed. For activity is the function of non-activity, and non-activity is the root of activity. One must first engage in activity and then return to non-activity to complete the wondrous path of the supreme, utterly real Dao. If one begins with non-activity and pursues stillness and stability, the foundation of life will not be firm, and one will ultimately fall into oblivion.\n\nShould one engage in activity yet fail to transcend, the ground of inherent nature remains unemptied, still bound within the Three Realms. The Perfected Lord of Purple Yang states:\n\n*“At first, with effort, few perceive its worth,\nOnly when effortless do all acknowledge its grace.\nThough effortless seems the wondrous key,\nWho knows that effort is the root’s embrace?”*\n\nThe one who acts is the Mind-Ape beneath Five Phases Mountain. The one who acts yet abides in non-action is the settled Mind-Ape beneath Five Phases Mountain. Throughout the text, from the monkey’s transformation into a spirit to the final passages where “monkey” recurs without mention of “ape,” it precisely reveals the principle that only after taming the monkey can the ape’s stillness be attained. As for Five Phases Mountain taking root and sealing seamlessly, responding to the breath of mortals—this is the Golden Elixir swallowed into the belly. Hunger met with iron pellets, thirst with molten bronze—both are of the metal class. The ape is metal within water, embodying the principle of like aiding like, is this not the work of nurturing unity and embracing the One?\n\nThus, observing the Tathāgata’s palm-turning subjugation of the ape, one may awaken to the truth that within the postnatal Five Phases lies the prenatal true essence of the One, requiring no distant quest—easily subdued as the turning of a palm.\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Buddha Composes the Sūtra to Transmit Ultimate Bliss; Guanyin Receives the Edict to Journey to Chang’an**\n\nWu Yizi says: The first seven chapters elucidate the Great Way of the Golden Elixir, which is cultivated through refining the prenatal true qi of the One. Its alchemical method, origins, firing times, beginning and end, secret techniques for commencement—all are encompassed without omission. Those who study the Dao, through silent observation and careful reflection, with a master’s guidance, may together realize bodhi and ascend to immortality.\n\nThe Immortal Master feared that the world’s foolish might believe immortals and buddhas are born, not attainable by ordinary beings through cultivation; or that enlightenment lies solely in the mind, attainable by oneself alone. Thus, the following text presents Xuanzang as an exemplar, and Sun Wukong, Zhu Wuneng, Sha Wujing, and the Dragon Horse as agents of transformation—demonstrating that immortality and buddhahood are within everyone’s reach, not innate or fixed; that mutual aid, not solitary practice, is the path.\n\nYet the text’s trials and monsters, its perils and hardships—spanning one hundred and eight thousand miles, eighty-one ordeals, and fourteen years—may well evoke fear, doubt, and hesitation, leading one to believe such a journey impossible, such tribulations inescapable, such merit unattainable. If so, then *Journey to the West* would become an obstacle, deterring seekers.\n\nThe Immortal Master’s intent in writing is to reveal that without true transmission, one faces endless trials and extreme suffering; with true transmission, one attains eternal bliss. Hence the chapter’s theme: *“The Buddha composes the sūtra to transmit ultimate bliss.”* It aims to rescue those undergoing trials with what is most proximate and effortless. For with this sūtra’s existence, one may avoid the remoteness of one hundred and eight thousand miles, the perils of eighty-one ordeals, and the protraction of fourteen years.\n\nThe opening chapter’s bold declaration—*“Journey to the West to release from tribulation”*—makes clear that the journey’s purpose is liberation, not the imposition of hardship. Yet the trials and tribulations arise because Xuanzang has not yet received true transmission. One might assume enlightenment comes only after reaching Vulture Peak, meeting the Buddha, and receiving the sūtra. How then does he shed his mortal form and attain realization at Cloud-Soaring Crossing?\n\nIt is not known that the Bodhisattva, upon receiving the edict to seek a monk, had already bestowed five treasures, instructed him to subdue his three disciples, and prepared his mount. Xuanzang had secretly received the *Tight-Fillet* incantation. The transmission of the true sūtra had already occurred when the Bodhisattva set forth for Chang’an—there was no need to reach the Western Heaven to attain the Dao.\n\nThe text’s insistence on the journey to the West merely points to the source of the Great Way; the one hundred and eight thousand miles, eighty-one ordeals, and fourteen years illustrate the critical importance of vigilance against danger, the stages of progress, and the firing times. The distance is not inherently far—it arises from insufficient effort in bearing the load, from taking the easy path of haste. Recognizing that one hundred and eight thousand miles are not truly distant, one sees the Dao before one’s eyes; the sudden awakening arrives with a single somersault.\n\nThe difficulty is not inherent—it arises from delusion by worldly ties, from the unevenness of leaks and gaps. Understanding that eighty-one ordeals are easily resolved, one finds boundless joy; the greatly courageous need only a single strike of the golden cudgel to conclude them.\n\nThe duration is not inherently long—it arises from ignorance of the firing times of medicinal substances and the subtleties of weights and measures. Knowing that fourteen years are not truly long, one may swiftly attain the sūtra; the adept, with the golden fillet’s restraint, is already within my grasp.\n\nWithout experiencing the extremity of suffering, one cannot know the truth of ultimate bliss; without enduring the bitterness of extreme suffering, one cannot know the joy of ultimate bliss. Without traversing one hundred and eight thousand miles, eighty-one ordeals, and fourteen years of remoteness, peril, and duration, one cannot comprehend that nine nines reduce to one nine, two treasuries to one treasury, five thousand forty-eight days to a single firing time.\n\nThis sūtra originates from the *Yinfu Jing* and the *Daode Jing*, composed by the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. The Immortal Master merely entrusted the Buddha with expounding its teachings, the Tang era with disseminating its practice, Xuanzang with exemplifying its standard, and *Journey to the West* with unfolding its meaning—using allegory to reveal its essence.\n\nIf one were to insist that only by journeying to the West to fetch the sūtra, as Xuanzang did, can the Dao be attained, then the ancient past would lack buddhas and immortals, and future generations would be cut off from the seeds of buddhahood and immortality. Such a path would be excessively complex, difficult, and abstruse—unattainable by all—rather than the simplest, easiest, and most immediate Way, accessible to all. This would contravene the Buddha’s compassionate intent in transmitting the sūtra.\n\nThe Buddha’s transmission of the sūtra encompasses two wondrous meanings: for those who have yet to attain the Dao, it directs them to journey west like Xuanzang to fetch the sūtra; for those who have already attained the Dao, it guides them, like awakening, to reach the West and return to the Buddha. Though the methods differ, the transmission is one, and the transmission leads to one Ultimate Bliss. The subtlety of the sūtra’s essence lies in the discernment of the enlightened mind—thus, only the divine insight of Guanyin Bodhisattva can truly uphold its practice.\n\nThe opening verse speaks of those who meditate in dark contemplation, wasting effort in vain pursuits: like \"grinding a brick to make a mirror,\" it cannot reflect form; like \"piling snow for grain,\" it cannot sate hunger. They toil until old age without achievement, leading the young astray. Such sayings as \"a hair swallowing the great sea\" or \"a mustard seed containing Mount Sumeru\" are baseless claims—even the \"Golden-Headed Ascetic\" would but smile in quiet amusement. If one awakens to this truth, they \"transcend the Ten Grounds and the Three Vehicles\"; if one remains mired in delusion, they fall into the \"Four Births and Six Paths,\" trapped in the wheel of rebirth for ten thousand kalpas, unable to escape.\n\nWho can hear the spring message of the cuckoo’s call at \"Cliff of No-Thought\" beneath the \"Shadeless Tree,\" suddenly shattering the dawn dream? Thus, the \"path to Caoxi is perilous\" and impassable; the \"clouds of Vulture Peak are deep\" and unreachable. Boundless and formless, it defies grasp. Here, the voices of old friends fade into silence—yet know this: amid the \"thousand-foot ice cliffs,\" the \"five-petaled lotus blooms,\" rising transcendent, its fragrance curling through ancient curtains and lingering upon timeworn silks.\n\nIf one can \"discern the source and flow\" herein, they will perceive the Dragon King’s three treasures and may then obtain the elixir, becoming immortal and buddha. How could mere meditation at the gate of Chan ever glimpse its depths? For Chan seeks only within the nature of the essence, neglecting the root of life—wasting endless effort until, in old age, one merges into the great transformation. How lamentable! How pitiful! They neither recognize the affair of the \"Mind-Ape beneath the Five Phases Mountain\" nor understand the matter of \"taming the Mind-Ape beneath the Five Phases Mountain.\"\n\nThus, when the Tathāgata returned to the Thunderclap Jeweled Monastery, he addressed all buddhas and bodhisattvas: \"With my profound, subtle, and wondrous compassion and prajñā, I survey the Three Realms. The fundamental nature of the root is ultimately quiescent, identical to the emptiness of space, utterly devoid of anything.\" By \"fundamental nature of the root,\" he means the original face. Though it is difficult to directly enter quiescence, by focusing on the nature of the essence in cultivation, one may, upon attaining the Dao, perceive that the original nature is ultimately quiescent—\"identical to the emptiness of space, utterly devoid of anything.\" \"Identical to the emptiness of space\" does not mean inert emptiness; \"utterly devoid of anything\" does not mean absolute nothingness.\n\nThe matter of subduing the rebellious monkey is known to none in the Three Realms. This matter is most true and most wondrous, neither quiescent nor inertly empty—it is merely that \"names arise with the beginning of birth and death,\" and the dharma’s appearance accords with this. If one claims the original nature is inherently empty and fails to recognize this matter, then it is not my profound teaching but merely clinging to quiescence, which is quiescence alone.\n\nLaozi said: \"The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth; the named is the mother of the myriad things.\" The nameless is death, the beginning of heaven and earth; the named is birth, entering into the Five Phases. The rebellious monkey is \"named birth and death’s beginning,\" its dharma-appearance deviating from the root source of its original nature—thus it cannot escape the Tathāgata’s palm or transcend beyond the Five Phases.\n\nIn the Buddha’s Ullambana jeweled basin, a hundred rare flowers and a thousand wondrous fruits are arrayed—this is the \"named, mother of the myriad things,\" the image of returning to the origin after purity. This inquiry is the meaning of the Buddha’s words: \"I possess a treasure, hidden within the mountain of form—do any of you recognize it?\" Thus, the assembly entreated the Tathāgata to \"clearly reveal the root,\" and the Tathāgata \"proclaimed the true fruit,\" unfolding the wondrous mysteries of the Three and Five. The Chan mind is the bright moon; the true nature embraces heaven—this is the true sūtra of the Three Treasuries of heaven, earth, and spirits.\n\nIn sum: the Three Treasuries are but the Three and Five; the Three and Five are but the One and Five; the One and Five are but the One. This One is the direct path of cultivating truth, the gate of true goodness. This sūtra, originating in the West, must await retrieval from the East—only one with the silent observation and secret discernment of a great being like Guanyin can obtain it.\n\nThe Tathāgata said: \"On this journey, you must tread carefully, not traveling in the clouds but keeping to half-cloud, half-mist, meticulously noting the distance of the path.\" This means the cultivator must proceed with grounded steps, advancing gradually, not indulging in empty fantasies or skipping stages. Yet one must also be fluid and spiritually attuned, free from attachment, for within it lies the sequence of fire-times and stages of practice—these must be carefully remembered and not transgressed.\n\nAmong the five treasures is \"a brocade kāṣāya robe.\" The kāṣāya is the garment of non-defilement. \"Brocade\" is woven from deep threads of five colors. In the five colors, it is blue, yellow, red, white, and black; in the five virtues, it is benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust; in the Five Phases, it is metal, wood, water, fire, and earth; in the five relationships, it is ruler-minister, father-son, husband-wife, elder-younger brothers, and friends; in the five directions, it is east, west, south, north, and center; in the five tones, it is gong, shang, jue, zhi, and yu; in the five flavors, it is salty, bitter, sour, spicy, and sweet; in the five seasons, it is spring, summer, autumn, winter, and the four seasons—extending to the five officials, five grains, and more, all of which cannot be exhaustively described. Yet all are but the One and Five, all are the treasure of \"a single brocade kāṣāya robe.\"\n\n\"A 'nine-ringed monastic staff,' the rings symbolizing the image of perfect completion without end. In the principles of numerology, it is cyclical recurrence; in yin and yang, it is the ebb and flow; in the firing times of alchemy, it is the nine rings; in substance and function, it is the interlocking chain; in the four corners, it is encirclement; in spirits and deities, it is contraction and extension; in Heaven and Earth, it is their efficacy; in life and death, it is beginning and end; in the four directions, it is unimpeded passage; in the unfathomable concealment and revelation, it is wisdom; in adapting to circumstances and responding to opportunities, it is expedient means—all residing within the One and Five, all the treasure of 'a nine-ringed monastic staff.'\n\nThese two treasures—one embodying completeness, the other efficacy—are why those who come here with steadfast resolve to seek the sutras may don the robe to escape the cycle of rebirth and wield the staff to avoid harm from poisons.\n\nThen there are the three bands, 'called the *tightening bands*, though identical in form, each serves a different purpose.' There are also the three incantations: 'Gold,' 'Tight,' and 'Forbid.' Gold signifies restraint, the measure of advance and retreat. Through gold’s restraint, none may evade its control. One is used to subdue the Great Sage, employing restraint as the means; another to subdue the Black Bear, using non-greed as restraint; and another to subdue Sudhana, using virtuous relinquishment as restraint. Though their applications differ, the method of tight restraint remains the same. This is the esoteric essence of elixir refinement. When lesser practitioners hear of it, they cannot but laugh in derision, so the immortal master conceals rather than explicates it. Why? Those who cultivate the Dao must purge all worldly entanglements, remaining unstained by even a speck of dust. Gold is the first thing to be restrained—this accords with common understanding, and all would readily accept it as true. Yet few realize that if gold’s primary function were abandoned even for a moment, one would become unrestrained and uncontrollable, unable to guide others into one’s own gate. Thus, gold must be employed first, and restraint must be tight, to prevent the peril of transgression and recklessness. Why? Because gold is something all see and readily assent to, something that catches the eye and stirs the mind. Once the thought of gold arises, the eyes grow dim and the mind agitated, leaving no room for leniency—one cannot but submit to gold’s command. The Perfected One said: 'To seek the treasure of Heaven, one must use the wealth of the world.' This is the esoteric essence. Though gold is of a single nature, its uses differ, and the thoughts it evokes vary, yet the method of tight restraint remains constant. If the worldly abandon restraint and transgress bounds, the sage enacts golden statutes to restrain them—another method of establishing boundaries.\n\nThis revelation may strike some as far-fetched, prompting laughter, but observe the passage: 'If he will not submit to your command, give him this band. Once worn on the head, it will naturally take root in the flesh. Recite the appropriate incantation, and he will be brought into my fold.' The meaning is quite clear. Thus, even if one does not begrudge the use of gold, the 'Gold, Tight, Forbid' restraints do not contradict the earlier explanation of common principles. Those who grasp this—devotees at the foot of Vulture Peak, the Golden Summit Immortals, who seek the Dao with unwavering resolve—may attain this state within two or three years. This is the true teaching. Swift attainment of the Dao is indeed possible, though the fourteen-year period is not an immutable term.\n\nYet among these five items, three remain, still embodying the meaning of Three and Five—this must not be overlooked. From this point, Sha Wujing manifests.\n\nThis Sha Wujing is the most essential and wondrous aspect of the elixir path, though readers often misconstrue him. Liu Zongyuan wrote: 'In the mountains of the Western Sea, there is a water so weak and diffuse it cannot bear even a mustard seed, sinking only when it reaches the bottom. Thus it is called *Weak Water*.' Yang Xiong’s *Rhapsody on the Sweet Springs* speaks of 'the eastern glow illuminating the Eastern Sea, the western radiance shining upon the Flowing Sands.' Weak Water and Flowing Sands are actual place names in the Western Regions, but the immortal master employs them as metaphors: the passions are easily drowned, the foundation of inherent nature is hard to stabilize, and one must rely on true earth to solidify it. True earth is true intention; Flowing Sands are earth without constancy. True earth is formless yet pervades the nine palaces. Without it, water, metal, wood, and fire cannot harmonize—its efficacy is unparalleled, hence the name 'Sha Monk.'\n\nAs for the title 'Roll-Curtain General,' the 'shattering of the glass goblet at the Peach Banquet,' the 'once every seven days, a flying sword pierces my ribs,' and 'what choice was there but to seek sustenance from travelers'—these seem devoid of meaning, yet profound significance lies within. The curtain separates inner and outer, safeguarding integrity and modesty, yet he carelessly rolled it up without scruple. The 'Peach Banquet' is meant to foster joyous harmony. The 'glass goblet,' formed from a thousand years of distilled water, is the supreme treasure of the West, the sole means of fostering harmony. His lack of sincerity caused him to shatter it, forfeiting that harmony, profaning the treasure, and neglecting his duty—his offense was grave. The 'seven days' mark the return of Heaven’s will. In the quiet of night, reflecting on the hidden recesses of his own conduct, he felt remorse and pain as if pierced by a flying sword. Was he not merely consuming the flesh of the sutra-seekers, becoming a useless demon? His 'nine skulls' symbolize the true earth of the nine palaces, so water cannot sink them. 'The sutra-seeker will find use for them'—their wondrous application will be detailed when he is subdued.\n\nHere, 'taking the sands as his surname,' he is named 'Sha Wujing,' 'enters the *sha* gate,' and 'purifies his mind and cleanses his thoughts, never again harming life.' From this, we know that to take refuge in the Pure Land, one must employ true intention and sincerity, avoiding carelessness that leads to harming life.\"\n\nFor the foundation of long life lies entirely in this earth’s harmonious union. Earth is the essential element in the refinement of the elixir—those who interpret Sha Wujing as pertaining to metal and water fail to grasp the true function of earth and merely speculate in vain.\n\nFrom this point, Zhu Bajie manifests his form. The pig belongs to *hai*, and within *hai* resides *jia*-wood. Wood can generate fire, hence the term “speech-ability.” The character *hai* (亥) contains *yi* (乙), signifying gestation, and *er ren* (二人), representing male and female. With two heads and six bodies, it embodies the tenth month of pure yin, yet the principle of yang never wholly perishes, thus embodying the ceaseless cycle of generation. Without the harmonious forging and refinement of the golden elixir, it cannot be accomplished.\n\n“Tianhe’s Marshal Tianpeng, having drunk, flirted with Chang’e.” *Peng* (蓬) signifies whirling without constancy, encountering the unpredictable—its nature is crooked yet upright, following righteousness while favoring metal. Wine is water-metal; upon meeting wood-metal, it spins without direction, and even Chang’e is toyed with. His true nature, akin to that of beasts, led him to “take the wrong path” and enter a pig’s womb. *Jia* is yang-wood, *mao* is yin-wood, so he was rightfully paired with the Second Sister of *mao*. “Before a year had passed, she died”—this reflects the principle of yang’s birth and yin’s demise. “All the cave’s possessions became mine to enjoy,” for within *hai*, *yi* gestates and receives emolument from *mao*. “Living by devouring others,” he indulged solely in wine and lust, “harming life” and taking lives, thus becoming a demon. Only when the Bodhisattva enlightened him did he “awaken as from a dream,” accept the precepts in earnest, and “sever the five pungent roots and three corpses,” hence the name “Zhu Bajie.”\n\nFrom this point, the White Horse manifests his form.\n\nFrom ancient times to the present, those who revere this tale as a guide take the ape as the heart and the horse as the mind. Yet if one claims the horse is the mind—since the heart is the essence of the mind, and the mind is the function of the heart—then all the wondrous and unfathomable feats, such as \"Great Sage Equaling Heaven\" wreaking havoc in the Heavenly Palace or the somersault cloud, should rightly be attributed to the White Horse. Why then are they solely ascribed to the ape? This reveals that the White Horse cannot be the mind.\n\nThe White Horse is a metal symbol, a dragon-horse. *Qian* represents the dragon and the horse. The horse is a creature of pure *Qian*, embodying the ceaseless vigor of *Qian*. Thus, those who cultivate the Dao must emulate the unrelenting diligence of *Qian*, possessing the great strength and burden-bearing capacity of the dragon-horse, only then can they journey to the West and obtain the scriptures. Ordinary horses, lacking such power, are inevitably hindered by Eagle Sorrow Gorge. If the horse were indeed the mind, would not those lesser horses also qualify? Yet why are they devoured by the dragon-horse, necessitating its presence?\n\nHowever, another crucial principle must be clarified: for those who cultivate the Dao, taming the dragon is the foremost task. If one indulges in reckless abandon, they destroy their own luminous pearl, becoming a malevolent dragon. With unstable roots, how can one bear the Dao or travel far? Therefore, one must retreat into the deep abyss, conceal brilliance, and nurture obscurity, only then can their potential be properly harnessed. From this point, the Great Sage emerges from concealment.\n\nThe marvels of the innate true *yi* have been thoroughly expounded earlier, and need not be reiterated. To summarize clearly: wood, numbered three, resides in the East; fire, numbered two, resides in the South. Wood generates fire, and these two elements share the same palace, thus two and three combine to form five. *Wuneng* (*Hai*) unites water and fire as one family. Metal, numbered four, resides in the West; water, numbered one, resides in the North. Metal generates water, and these two elements share the same palace, thus four and one combine to form five. *Wukong* (*Shen*) unites metal and water as one family. *Wu* and *Ji*, inherently the generative number five, form the three fives. *Wujing* embodies the earth family, and the union of the three fives becomes the Supreme Ultimate.\n\n*Tai* signifies the utmost greatness; *ji* denotes the utmost essential. Its principle lies within primordial chaos, and with a single movement, yin and yang are born. Yin and yang are *qi*. This is the principle that gives rise to *qi*, and *qi* in turn embodies the principle. Only with the *qi* of the innate true *yi* can the three families be generated; after the three families converge, they in turn generate the *qi* of the innate true *yi*, forming the spiritual infant. The infant relies entirely on the operation of this *qi* to shed its mortal form and become a true person.\n\n*Xuanzang* is this infant, thus he cannot be separated from *Wukong*; indeed, neither *Wuneng* nor *Wujing* can be separated from *Wukong*. As the *Wuzhen Pian* states: “East three and South two together make five, North one and West four share the same. *Wu* and *Ji* inherently reside in the generative number five; the three families converge to form the spiritual infant.” This is the true essence. Alas!\n\nRevealing the Dao to this point,世人 cannot fathom its meaning, inevitably resorting to wild conjecture and misguided speculation, their perverse doctrines and defiled practices reducing the most true and supreme wondrous Way to mere child’s play. Those with the aspiration to study the Dao must swiftly seek a true master, receiving step-by-step guidance to avoid falling into the cycle of rebirth.\n\nIn the closing of this chapter, the Great Sage’s four characters—“seeing nature and illuminating the mind”—the word “mind” here precisely strikes at the human heart, echoing the earlier teaching of Patriarch Subodhi: “After attaining the Dao, one must see nature and illuminate the mind.” At the very outset of Daoist practice, to be able to see nature and illuminate the mind is indeed the subtlety of the three vehicles of Chan. Yet if one knows only non-action and not action, this is no more than solitary cultivation of a single yin element—how can the elixir be formed and the sacred embryo achieved? In the end, one falls into emptiness. How lamentable! How pitiful!\n\nMaster Ziyang the Perfected says:\n*“To see non-action as the essential subtlety is not as good as action as the foundation.”*\n\nAncestor Shangyang says:\n*“To reach old age in non-action, how can one attain joy? Entering the chamber to gather lead—this is called action. In the marketplace of great virtue, who will awaken?”*\n\nTo forge the vast expanse, first establish the firm boundaries.\nOnly when the millet-grain pearl is obtained is one not in error.\nNine years of sitting in forgetfulness—non-action’s merit is vast.\nWhen the three thousand deeds are fulfilled, joy is shared with all.\nYet if one clings to non-action alone, without first engaging in action,\nThis is but the folly of the deluded, self-bound in attachment!\nThese earnest words are spoken to enlighten later learners.\n\nFor seeing nature and illuminating the mind are the specialized practices *after* obtaining the elixir;\nThe gathering of the Five Phases is the very foundation of buddhahood and transcendence.\nIf one only sees nature and illuminates the mind but does not gather the Five Phases,\nOne will surely fail to escape the cycle of rebirth.\n\nLike the Tang monk who had yet to form the sacred embryo,\nWho required the three families to complete its coalescence;\nLike Sun Wukong, whose Five Phases were already settled,\nYet still needed to see the Tathāgata to achieve liberation.\nWhen one reads the exchange of gratitude between master and disciple aboard the bottomless boat,\nAll becomes clear.\n\n**Chapter Nine: Chen Guangrui Meets Disaster on His Official Journey; The River-Flowing Monk Avenges His Origins**\n\nWu Yizi says: To read without a discerning eye is to bury the ancient masters’ painstaking intent—\nLike savoring fine delicacies yet tasting no sweetness,\nOr obtaining a piece of Bian jade yet mistaking it for common stone.\n\nYet how arduous it is! In leisure, I have perused the commentaries and exegeses of classics and histories, parsing their distinctions thread by thread—yet discrepancies abound, and clarity remains elusive. How much more so with this book, whose allusions branch in myriad directions, whose metaphors coil in hidden meanings? For centuries, it has been lumped together with trivial tales and absurd fables, casually dismissed or lightly mocked, serving only as fodder for idle wit.\n\nAlas! To read the books of sages is difficult; to read the books of immortals is even more so! To read the books of immortals without recognizing them as such, yet still seek to grasp their sublime essence—is this not harder still? To read without recognizing their immortal nature, yet strive to reveal their profundities so that all may perceive their transcendent wisdom and, without exception, become immortals themselves—is this not the most arduous task of all?\n\nTake this very chapter: readers may dismiss it as merely recounting the Tang monk’s past, devoid of deeper significance. Its events seem contradictory, at odds with worldly norms and common sentiment, scarcely worthy of belief. Consider the gaudy decorations, the bride-selecting ball toss—rites unrecorded in proper wedding customs.\n\nHow could the mother of a *zhuangyuan* be reduced to living alone in a foreign land? Would the daughter of a prime minister lack an escort when assuming office? A prefect’s wife could never secretly appear by the riverside. A single plank as a raft—hardly a sound plan to safeguard an infant. The beloved daughter won by the bride-selecting ball—why would she vanish without a trace? The doting mother of an official in office—how could she become a beggar after parting? Even if constrained by bureaucratic rank, how could there be no promotion for eighteen full years? Though kin and acquaintances may be few, could there truly be no word at all from even the most distant relation? Seeking one’s mother and recognizing her—how could one simply stride into the inner yamen? Pouring out one’s heart so freely—could it be that in a city of such size, with its cold officials and desolate offices, there were no gatekeepers to bar entry, no servants or maids in attendance? And once the scheme unraveled and capture was imminent, how could one muster an army of sixty thousand? Such manifold absurdities weary the reader’s ear. Earlier scholars have often excised this chapter, deeming it dispensable.\n\nAlas! The immortal master’s learning spans past and present; his breast encompasses the workings of creation. He is intimately versed in the ways of the world and human sentiment, in the canons and measures of governance—would he ever wield such a careless brush? Nay, the immortal master’s profound intent and sublime expression lie precisely here, beyond the ken of ordinary minds. For he traces straight to the origins of Xuanzang’s parents’ birth, thereby illuminating the foundational workings of the Golden Elixir’s great Dao. The eighty-one trials of later chapters are rooted in this; the attainment of true fruition is rooted in this. All revolves around saving the golden carp—water giving rise to metal, the principle of inversion and reversal.\n\nMetal can generate water, yet without water, it falls to the butcher’s block and cannot preserve its life. Water can generate metal, and with metal, it connects to the divine and can even revive the dead. Thus, preserving the life of metal is to preserve one’s own life; saving metal from death is to save oneself from death—this is the unifying principle, the very purpose for which Guanyin was sent to Chang’an. Hence, the mother can give birth to the child, and the child can in turn give birth to the mother. Mother and child mutually generate each other, and the alchemical method is complete.\n\nObserve: *\"In the Joyous Hall prefectural yamen, a son was born. By his ear, the Star Lord of the Southern Pole whispered, ‘By Guanyin’s dharma-decree, in days to come, husband and wife, mother and child shall reunite. Remember my words well. Awake! Awake!’\"* This is meant to awaken the world—how could it be intended for Joyous Hall alone? *\"Joyous Hall\"* is metal, the product of the mountain’s opening. *\"River Flow\"* is water, born of metal’s nurturing—metal generates water. *\"Secretly cast into the river’s edge\"*—metal generates water. *\"Flowing straight to Golden Mountain, where the raft came to rest\"*—metal generates water. *\"Seeking my mother within the Jiangzhou yamen\"*—water generates metal. *\"Rushing into the residence to rescue his mother\"*—water generates metal. *\"Xuanzang desperately tearing at the bonds\"*—water generates metal.\n\nYet without discerning the myriad falsehoods of the world, one cannot know the singular truth within water. Only the bodhisattva’s divine insight can faithfully uphold this true decree. Guanyin was sent to Chang’an to enable Chang’an to perceive the great Dao. Alas, Chang’an *\"changed its reign title to Zhenguan\"*—able only to glimpse the Dao faintly, like a woman’s chastity. With a *Zhenguan* sovereign above, the great Dao could not be perceived; below, with Wei Zheng as minister, the grand vision could not be nurtured. *\"Wei\"* sounds like *\"falsehood\"*—falsehood; *\"Zheng\"* means *\"outward verification.\"* If the vision is chaste but not great, then verification is false and not true. The transformation through reverent inaction is distant, and none in the world can perceive it. This meaning is not my own fabrication—observe how the immortal master prominently introduces the four characters *\"Zhenguan Wei Zheng\"* at the chapter’s outset, making it abundantly clear.\n\nNow examine the falsehoods in the encounters of Xuanzang’s parents: The selection of the top scholar and appointment to office—Chen Guangrui’s case—yet the one who took office was the bandit Liu Hong. Here lies the falsehood in seeking talent and employing men, plain to see. The daughter of a prime minister resorting to a bride-selecting ball to arrange her own marriage—here lies the falsehood in the proper beginnings of husband and wife, the perversion of marriage rites. An official murdered by bandits, with the brigand’s faction usurping power—rulers and ministers unaware, colleagues indifferent. Here lies the falsehood in the laws of ruler and minister. An official left unpromoted for eighteen years, allowing bandits to tyrannize the people unchecked—here lies the falsehood in the selection and appointment system. Binding a false prefect and commanding sixty thousand troops—here lies the falsehood in military governance and temple calculations. Literature as a ladder to advancement, yet unknowingly becoming a path to destruction—here lies the falsehood in literature. Office as a place to honor oneself, yet unknowingly becoming a road to ruin—here lies the falsehood in fame and achievement. Leaving one’s mother to take office, yet losing all news of life or death; seeking to honor one’s parents yet reducing them to beggary—here lies the falsehood in honor and disgrace. Taking one’s wife along, yet parting in an instant—here lies the falsehood in love and affection. Over many years, parents unable to inquire after their children’s survival, children unable to send word to their parents; kin unable to assist, friends unable to help—here lies the falsehood in family and friendship.\n\nChen Guangrui gained office and a wife—falsehood. Liu Hong gained office and a wife—falsehood within falsehood. Chen Guangrui gained the favor of ruler and people—falsehood. Liu Hong gained the favor of ruler and people—falsehood within falsehood. Chen Guangrui faced death and life—falsehood. Liu Hong faced life and death—falsehood within falsehood. Lady Zhang had a son yet had no son—falsehood in mother and child. Miss Yin had a husband yet had no husband—falsehood in husband and wife. The Kaishan couple had a daughter yet had no daughter—falsehood in filial piety and compassion.\n\nAll this serves as proof that all is false—yet all is also a manifestation of *Zhenguan*. None of it compares to the salvation of the golden-scaled carp. That single act in the water alone could span beginning to end, reuniting flesh and blood in true and tangible fulfillment. The Way of salvation lies solely in the child born of water repaying his mother’s kindness.\n\nMiss Yin, after all, calmly cut her own throat—was this not the *zhen* (\"integrity\") she beheld? It mirrors the \"Zhenguan\" (\"True Vision\") at the chapter’s outset, bringing the core theme full circle. \"The monk Jiangliu resolved to settle into meditation\"—was this not the *da* (\"greatness\") he beheld? It reflects back upon Guanyin’s commission to journey to Chang’an, inverting the falsity of *Zhenguan*.\n\nThe key lies in one’s spiritual vision and discernment, in seeking the original face before parents were born—that is all.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Ten**\n*The Old Dragon King’s Foolish Scheme Violates Heaven’s Decree*\n*Minister Wei’s Letter Entrusted to an Underworld Official*\n\nWu Yizi says: Why do people read plain and ordinary words yet dismiss them as strange and unorthodox? It is because their vision is narrow, their steps confined. They see the Rabbit Garden but not the Lacquer Garden; they tread the azure clouds but not the Blue Ox. What they perceive is small, and where they rush is lowly.\n\nIn this chapter, the rulers and ministers of *Zhenguan* fail to attain great vision. All their deeds exist only within a dream. No one is without dreams, and none fail to recognize the illusory nature of dreams. None fail to see that worldly affairs are as illusory as dreams—so why, then, do they doubt the Tang emperor and his ministers dreaming of dragons seeking rescue, dreaming of slaying karmic dragons, dismissing it all as absurd and unorthodox?\n\nIt is not only the Tang emperor and his ministers who dream such dreams. From ancient times to the present, anyone might have such dreams. Why doubt the emperor’s decree or the minister’s intent at the time, as if they were not all willingly partaking in the same dream?\n\nThe emperor says, \"I dreamed thus.\"\nThe minister says, \"I dreamed likewise.\"\nThe generals say, \"I dreamed likewise.\"\nThe officials and attendants—who among them does not say, \"I dreamed likewise\"?\nThe entire nation, from ministers to commoners—who dares not say, \"I dreamed likewise\"?\n\nAt such a time, no one of great vision stands forth, robed in solemnity, tablet in hand, and declares: \"This is a dream, a wandering spirit’s delusion.\" One who can perceive the mind and see the nature, who grasps the supreme and truly wondrous Dao, knows that all worldly affairs are illusion—how much more so dreams!\n\nHad the Tang emperor suddenly awakened and said, \"Truly, it was a dream,\" then the dream would not recur. The Jing River would have no dragon without a head; the prime minister’s hall would lack the sword for slaying dragons; the cloud’s edge would not drop a severed head; the city gate would not display a decapitated skull. They would not die in dreams, live in dreams, and dream without end.\n\nAlas, theirs was *Zhenguan*—their vision was small. They believed the dragon had defied Heaven and sought their aid, and so they agreed to save it. They believed Heaven’s punishment was entrusted to them, and so they wielded the blade to strike. Those adept at divining the emperor’s will would surely urge, \"You can save it,\" and thus the hand would move the pieces on the board. Those skilled at aligning with the minister’s heart would surely seize the moment to offer, \"You can slay it,\" and thus the head would hang in the marketplace.\n\nIf it is a dream within a dream, awakening is still possible. Within the false, there remains truth—Guanyin saving the dragon with a willow branch is such a case. But if it is not a dream yet treated as one, there is no moment of awakening or revival. Within the false, there is only further falsehood—Wei Zheng sending a letter to Cui Jue is such a case.\n\nWei Zheng sought to interfere with Heaven’s punishments, and it is clear he would interfere with human punishments as well. He would meddle in the affairs of the underworld, and it is no stretch to see he would meddle in the affairs of the living. Where there is one falsehood, all is false; where there is one sign, all is sign—all wrought by those who cling to \"Zhenguan.\"\n\nThe Immortal Master does not mean to disparage Wei Zheng but uses him to expose the illusions of worldly affairs through the ages. There is no sign that is not false, no vision that is not *Zhenguan*. In the final analysis, it is better to be an unranked scholar, a woodsman like Zhang Yu or Li Qiao who can read and has a firm perspective. Their words say:\n\nThose who contend for fame lose their bodies for its sake;\nThose who seize profit die for its sake.\nThus, the pursuit of fame and profit by scholars and officials is false, and their striving is but a dream.\n\nThose who receive titles sleep embracing tigers;\nThose who enjoy favor run with snakes up their sleeves.\nThus, titles and favor are all false, and their acceptance is but a dream.\n\nThey also say:\n\"Take care on the road ahead, be vigilant—\nTomorrow at the street’s end, few will be familiar.\"\nHow sharp and urgent their warning!\n\nYuan Shoucheng knew the fish would swim into the net, knew fate would violate the year’s decree, knew rain would fall in due measure. Forewarned, he did not enter the dream. The Jing River dragon, deluded by the yaksha, by the broken divination, by the wager, by Marshal Shi, abandoned all caution to vie for victory, defied the law, and acted recklessly—dreaming within a dream, he plunged deeper into the dream.\n\nThe Tang emperor dreamed of a karmic dragon seeking rescue and convened his ministers to discuss the strange dream. Wei Zheng dreamed of slaying the karmic dragon and, in the emperor’s dream, left his body to wield the sword. The Tang emperor dreamed the karmic dragon demanded his life, saw ghosts and feared them—all one great dream. The civil and military officials kept night watch at the palace gates to suppress ghosts—all the court was dreaming. Even the Tang emperor’s death and Wei Zheng’s guarantee of his longevity seemed to place the Son of Heaven’s life and death in his grasp. Sending a letter to Cui Jue, he claimed, \"In a dream, I once met you,\" as if the authority of the King of Hell could be swayed by him—was this not the greatest dream of all?\n\nThus, the Tang emperor tucked the letter into his sleeve and closed his eyes, never to return. This clumsy dragon’s case was a realm of their own making, conjured in the hearts of the Tang emperor and his ministers. Its hidden signs await revelation in later chapters, but its dreamlike nature is no different from the ant in the locust tree or the deer beneath the plantain—all waking illusions.\n\nAt first, what strangeness was there? Yet the old dragon’s clumsy scheme was never truly his own; his delayed rain-bringing invited heavenly punishment. Its profound meaning and subtle principles cannot be conveyed in mere words. A poem hints at the intent:\n\n*\"Clouds and rain bestow life upon the myriad things—\nTake care to act with precision, never tardy.\nThe clumsy dragon wagered against the mysterious decree,\nDrawing the divine blade to follow close behind.\"*\n\nThe *Yin Fu Jing* says: *\"Fire is born of wood, and calamity inevitably strikes.\"* Does this not describe such a case? Today’s temporal masters delude the world with arts of \"controlling women and waging battle,\" inviting ruin upon themselves—just as the *Shi* military advisor taught the old dragon to delay his rain, to wager and compete, defying heavenly judgment. Should we not take heed?\n\nThe Immortal Master calls him the *Shi* military advisor—its meaning is clear.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Eleven**\n*The Tang Emperor Visits the Underworld and Returns to Life;\nLiu Quan Presents Melons and Fruits to Reunite with His Wife*\n\nWu Yizi says: This chapter directly speaks of the Tang emperor’s entry into the dream to illustrate the Dao of yin-yang resonance—even the principle of exchange between man and woman. Where there is stimulus, there must be response; where there is cause, there must be effect, with not even a hair’s breadth of deviation.\n\nEmperor Gaozu of Tang once dreamed of his own death, falling beneath his bed to be devoured by maggots. The Chan master Zhipu interpreted this as a sign of the multitudes rallying to him. The present dream of Taizong is unprecedented. Yet what one does by day, one dreams by night. His journey through the underworld—was this not the hidden truth of the \"Zhenguan\" era? The evil of hidden truths, conceived in the heart and taking form in dreams—here, one must take \"the heart\" as the master, for the peril of the human heart is the peril of hell itself. Like a shadow following the body, it cannot be erased.\n\nIn this chapter:\nTaizong, lost and alone, trembles in terror, unable to find his way. In haste, he sends a private letter seeking refuge. At the Gate of Ghosts, he encounters the late Emperor Gaozu and his brothers demanding their due. He pleads the case of the clumsy dragon. The ledger of life and death is amended. He tours the underworld, heart pounding with dread. Passing through the eighteen layers of hell, his spirit quails. Gazing upon the Bridge of Helplessness, his heart again trembles. Arriving at the City of Wrongful Death, he is seized with terror. A horde of ghosts blocks his path, leaving him nowhere to hide; he begs Cui Pan for rescue and borrows Xiang Liang’s gold and silver to bribe his way free. Witnessing the Six Paths of Reincarnation, the judge urges Taizong to \"illumine his heart and perceive his nature.\" Only when the underworld is free of cries of grievance will the mortal realm enjoy the blessings of peace. Every unwholesome deed may be amended one by one.\n\nThus, the chapter’s true purport is revealed: if one refrains from unwholesome acts in the mortal world, the underworld will naturally be free of hell’s perils. Every detail is painted from the heart, all drawn from Taizong’s past deeds and the unease they stir within him. Those who critique *Journey to the West* yet overlook this chapter’s focus on the heart are truly baffling.\n\nThe most striking moment comes when the wronged souls demand retribution, and the judge says, *\"If Your Majesty offers them some money, I can save you.\"* Taizong replies, *\"I came here empty-handed—where would I get money?\"* This is what is meant by *\"Ten thousand taels of gold cannot be taken, but a lifetime of karma follows you.\"* When the judge says money can save him, does he truly mean it? No—he means that here, money cannot reach, cannot be used—how then can it save you? Later, when he borrows Xiang Liang’s gold and silver, is this truly a loan? No—it means that in the mortal world, evil deeds bring evil retribution, and good deeds bring good retribution. In the underworld, the thirteen years of an emperor’s reign are no match for the thirteen treasuries of a commoner; the fifteen circuits of an emperor’s governance are no match for the single treasury entrusted to a commoner. The profound meaning lies in the reversal—readers must not cling to the surface!\n\nIn later chapters, when Xiang Liang and his wife’s accumulated wealth is revealed to be the fruit of alms-giving and virtuous deeds—not merely gold, silver, or paper money—the truth becomes clear.\n\nTaizong enters the great dream because of the old dragon, and upon reaching the Gate of Ghosts, he should have encountered the ghostly dragon demanding his life. Why, instead, does he first meet the late Emperor Gaozu and his brothers, with no sign of the dragon? The Immortal Master embeds the intent of the *Spring and Autumn Annals* in hidden words. I reveal the unspoken meaning of *Journey to the West* to clarify what the Immortal Master left unsaid.\n\nWhen the Sui dynasty’s governance faltered, the realm pursued the deer together. Raising the banner of righteousness to overthrow tyranny and rescue the people from fire and water—this was a cause both just and right.\n\nHow then could he employ Pei Ji’s cunning schemes, sending palace women of the Sui to attend the High Ancestor? By coercing him with an inescapable situation, he ensnared his father in unrighteousness, transgressing the bounds of filial duty and offending the august will of Heaven. The silent decree of retribution found its accomplices in his ministers and aides, who enabled the plot. The High Ancestor, like clouds moving and rain bestowing, failed in restraint—just as the old dragon was misled by the eel’s strategist. For defying the timely summons and delaying the clouds and rain, fearing celestial punishment and meeting the sword of wisdom, was this not fitting?\n\nThe dragon of the Jing River was none other than Li Yuan—hence called \"old.\" The phrase *\"rain and water together measured three feet three inches and forty-eight drops\"* cryptically encodes the name \"Li Yuan.\" Combining the two characters: three horizontal strokes form three feet, three vertical strokes form three inches, and the four water radicals with the eighteen strokes of *zi* make forty-eight drops. Further, when merged and arranged, they resemble the shape of the character \"four,\" and when calculated separately, yield the number twenty-four (four times six); combined with the three water radicals and the character *ba*, they form another twenty-four (three times eight), totaling forty-eight drops. Removing the three vertical strokes subtracts three inches; removing the *ba* and *zi* from \"Li\" subtracts eight drops. The remaining strokes of \"Li\" (一) and \"Yuan\" (氵) combine to form \"Jing.\" Thus, \"Li Yuan\" is veiled as \"Jing.\" The dragon lurks in the depths, the old dwells in the turbid—Jing River was indeed his domain.\n\nYet when Taizong transformed the household into a state, he falsely claimed to rescue his father from peril while failing to avert the decree of Heaven’s justice. Concealing soldiers at Xuanwu Gate, he secretly accused his father of debauchery in the rear palace, then proclaimed his own unrecognized merits, forcing the events of the fourth day of the sixth month—seizing the throne by coercing his father and killing his brother, following the same path as Yang Guang. This was but a continuation of the Sui’s downfall. Guang perished in thirteen years, and Shimin died in thirteen years—was this not fitting?\n\nMoreover, he took the consort of Prince Chaoli and fraudulently fabricated an heir, corrupting the bonds of husband and wife, father and son, brothers and sisters—so thoroughly that even the virtuous Lady Li, who cast herself into the noose to preserve wifely integrity, or Liu Quan, who risked death to present melons and uphold the husband’s authority, were not their equal. Thus, he was right to have the soul of Princess Wang seized, reuniting her in life and death with her kin, allowing husband and wife, father and child, brother and sister to reopen the lotus stem and gather in one chamber.\n\nWhen Taizong wielded the blade, the bonds of fraternal loyalty were utterly extinguished, leaving no trace to extend to his sister. Such is the retribution of yin and yang, precise to the finest hair. Therefore, the Immortal Master, through Taizong’s own words, declared: *\"When I return to the yang world, I shall repay only with melons and fruit.\"* The \"southern melon\" (*nan gua*): *nan* (south) is *li* (fire), belonging to the heart. It signifies that as long as the heart’s ground is luminous, the fruit will be the recompense. As the *Book of Songs* says: *\"You cast me a quince, I return you a gemmed plum. Not as repayment, but to forever cherish the bond.\"* Lady Li’s noose and Liu Quan’s melon were the cast quince; Cuilian’s borrowed corpse and Yuying’s descent were the gemmed plum in return. Male and female embody the Dao of yin and yang; gift and reciprocity embody the principle of karmic retribution. To forever cherish the bond is to revive even after death. Compared to those who privately add two years of life or falsely borrow a treasury—though revived, they remain in a great dream—how vast is the difference!\n\nYet Taizong’s experience was but a dream, not true death. All the visions of hell were self-constructed within his mind. Thus, when his ministers spoke at the moment of returning to yang, they asked: *\"What does Your Majesty still find unsettling?\"* This is the true record. When the civil and military officials of the Eastern and Western Palaces all memorialized: *\"How could Your Majesty’s dream of the former court last so long before awakening?\"*—the words *\"a dream\"* were spoken with utter clarity.\n\n**Note:**\n\nEmperor Taizong ascended the throne at twenty-nine, changed the era name to *Zhenguan*, and lived to fifty-three. He reigned for twenty-four years in truth, not thirty-three. Now, when it is said that the thirteenth year of *Zhenguan* had two years added to it, the matter seems erroneous—yet therein lies a subtle meaning. For Gaozu Yuan reigned nine years, though in reality, it was Taizong’s scheming within the palace that coerced and usurped the throne. Thus, though *Wude* held the empty title, *Zhenguan* had already seized the divine regalia. If the nine years of *Wude* are shifted and added to the twenty-four of *Zhenguan*, does it not make thirty-three years? One and three make two and three; two and three make three and three—three threes precisely yield nine. Hence, the addition of two strokes already conveys the meaning of adding nine years, a stroke of the immortal master’s ingenuity.\n\nTaking the thirteenth year as the time of his journey through the netherworld was to foreshadow the continuation of life after death. Adding two strokes revealed the hidden power of yin usurpation, exposing the concealed disloyalty to his father. Later, when Xuanzang returned after fourteen years, he did so beyond the falsely added years, so Taizong should not have lived to see it. Thus, the thirty-three years of his reign were merely a device to conclude the narrative of his westward journey and the transmission of scriptures for the salvation of the world.\n\nLater generations, in discussing governance, extol the *Zhenguan* era of the Tang, nearly achieving a realm where punishments were laid aside. Yet the great root was already flawed, and all its branches and leaves were but falsehoods—what was there truly to admire? The immortal master used this to expound grandly, urging those who cultivate the Dao to refine their minds and selves in pursuit of the Great Way. If one resorts to deception and fraud, even the slightest unease in the heart is to forge one’s own hell. Thus, the Old Dragon, heeding the advice of his marshal, grew careless and unrestrained—yet could not escape a single sword. The Tang king, seeking Cui the Judge, could not set his heart at ease—and so had two strokes falsely added. Contrast this with Wukong, who set his heart down, stormed the halls of Fengdu, personally expunged his name from the ledger of the dead, and eradicated the ten classes of beings. Though all were dreams, their awakenings differed.\n\nIn sum, those who comprehend the Dao and set their hearts down will surely, like Wukong, clearly dissolve the records of death and ascend to heaven. Those who fail to comprehend the Dao and cannot set their hearts at ease will, like Taizong, secretly extend their lifespans—only to descend into the earth. Heaven and hell lie within the heart. Joy and terror both—how can one not be vigilant!\n\nI once traveled to Daliang and visited the ancient Great Xiangguo Monastery. Its monastic halls stood towering and resplendent, with sandalwood relics spread across the fields—no less grand than the Bao Guo Monastery of Yandu. The last pavilion soared high into the azure, inscribed with the name \"Sutra Repository.\" Ascending its layered stairs was like spiraling a conch; four tiers of flying eaves encircled it, crimson railings winding in curves. Gazing downward, all below appeared as ducks and ants, clouds and trees emerging and vanishing, their forms shifting with each step—truly a wondrous sight.\n\nAt its center stood a solemn altar, flanked by eight cabinets, their locks and bolts secure, housing the sutras within. In the right corner stood statues of a man and woman: the man with thick brows and a commoner’s topknot, the woman with a purple complexion and bared chest, both beaming with joy. I inquired of the guiding monk, who explained they were the \"Water-Selling Lord and Lady.\" The tales of Taizong’s journey through the underworld, his borrowing of paper money, and his revival to rebuild the monastery aligned perfectly with *Journey to the West*. Examining the stele, I found records of the monastery’s founding, its origins unknown, flourishing in the sixth year of Tianbao during the Northern Qi, and restored under Emperor Ruizong of Tang. Though the annals detailed successive renovations in great depth, they made no mention of the deeds of Lord Xiang and his wife. Yet the couple had indeed contributed to the monastery’s merit. Their statues and the Sutra Repository endured through the ages, proving that the chronicler’s account was not entirely baseless mirages or illusions.\n\nAlas! The two elders, toiling as water-sellers, amassed their wealth with great difficulty, yet delighted in benevolence and giving, never scheming for themselves. Their station was humble, but their vision was vast. Though they may not have fully comprehended the Dao, they glimpsed one facet of the great Way. As Laozi said: *\"Putting oneself last, one finds oneself first; losing oneself, one preserves oneself.\"* Lord Xiang and his wife embodied this. Contrast them with those who hoard wealth and cling to stinginess, perishing in an instant—some even leaving descendants as beggars. What, then, was the purpose of their lives? How lamentable!\n\n**Chapter Twelve: Xuanzang Holds Sincere Convocation—Guanyin Manifests to Transform the Golden Cicada**\n\nWu Yizi remarked: *\"The vinegar fly calls the jar vast; the well-frog calls the sky small.\"* Yet the jar is not truly vast, nor the sky truly small—it is but the limitation of their view.\n\nThis chapter once more invokes the term *\"Zhenguan\"* to mark the inception of the convocation, revealing it as the *\"Zhenguan\"* of a woman, not the grand vision of a great sovereign. The governance of Taizong was *\"Zhenguan\"* indeed, yet Xuanzang surpassed it; the memorials of Fu Yi were *\"Zhenguan\"* as well, yet Xiao Yu surpassed them—both were, in essence, *\"Zhenguan.\"* When Taizong bestowed upon Xuanzang a five-colored brocade kasaya, it was deemed the height of splendor and imperial favor. Little did he know of the Buddha’s gift of a brocade kasaya and a nine-ringed tin staff, the most resplendent and dazzling of treasures. After the Bodhisattva’s praise, Taizong’s offering paled into insignificance. When Taizong commanded Xuanzang to gather monks for meditation and sutra lectures, opening wide the gates of expedient means, it was called a grand convocation. Yet the Bodhisattva, striking the jeweled platform, cried aloud: *\"Monk! You speak only of the Lesser Vehicle—can you expound the Great Vehicle?\"* Once the Bodhisattva revealed the Mahāyāna Tripiṭaka, it could elevate the deceased to heaven, deliver the afflicted from suffering, cultivate a body of boundless life, and attain the state of neither coming nor going. Xuanzang’s usual teachings, by comparison, could only harmonize with the mundane. Why? For beholding the supremely beautiful, the merely beautiful loses its luster; gazing upon the boundlessly great, the merely great diminishes.\n\nThe Bodhisattva manifested her true form of salvation, adorned in majestic splendor. From midair descended a scroll, inscribed: *\"In the West lies wondrous scripture,\"* and *\"Seek the true golden body.\"* This wondrous scripture of the West is the true Dao of the Golden Elixir. Xuanzang, vowing to journey to the two heavens, was styled *\"Tripiṭaka,\"* for he embodied the true scriptures of the Three Baskets in one. The name united the Five Phases of the three traditions.\n\nWhat is *\"Tripiṭaka\"*? In terms of scripture count: 5,048 scrolls form one *piṭaka*, totaling 15,144 scrolls. In terms of the Five Phases: Metal and Water form one *piṭaka*, Wood and Fire another, and Earth the third. In terms of yin and yang: Heaven is one *piṭaka*, Earth another, and Ghosts the third. Ghosts are the innate efficacy of the two qi, pervading all between heaven and earth. At this point, Xuanzang bore the name of the Three Baskets but not yet their reality—hence, he was called the *\"Golden Cicada.\"* The cicada does not sing with its mouth, drinks but does not eat, dwells in lowliness yet ascends to heights, the most refined of creatures, symbolizing purity, non-action, and a nature that embraces emptiness. Gold is a body tempered through a hundred refinings, radiant and indestructible, symbolizing the luminous emptiness of the nature. Yet though the nature is complete, the root of life remains unsecured—this is the *\"towering Buddhist hall with no Buddha within.\"* Thus, Xuanzang’s grasp of the Lesser Vehicle was but the hollow shell of a golden cicada. Only after the meeting of the three traditions could the foundation of life be fulfilled, forging a body of true, indestructible gold and beholding the Tathāgata—this is the teaching of the Great Vehicle.\n\nGuanyin, sent by the Buddha’s decree, revealed her intent through the five-colored brocade kasaya and the nine-ringed precious staff. Xuanzang, in receiving these, had grasped the Buddha’s decree without remainder. The kasaya symbolized the gathering of the Five Phases; the nine rings, the ninefold return of cyclical refinement—hence, *\"manifesting to transform the golden cicada.\"* Not *\"deliverance,\"* but *\"transformation,\"* like timely rain that causes seeds to sprout and burst forth.\n\nReaders of *Journey to the West* may find what follows strange and fantastical, doubting its authenticity. Yet the three disciples to come are the meeting of the three traditions, the medicinal ingredients; the eighty-one trials are the ninety-ninefold return, the firing process. The dispositions of the Five Phases and the numinous power of the nine transformations are inherently mutable and unfathomable. Wherever the brush touches, it reveals true and wondrous forms, the most profound and ordinary principles. Within lie courageous progress, vigilance against peril, and every subtle precept of the Dharma, all fully present. The line *\"the Great Thunderclap Monastery of the Western Heaven, the realm of Tathāgata, our Buddha\"* is a most revealing declaration. Those with innate immortal bones, if they study this book deeply and discern its mysteries, will receive its teachings as if from a true master, and the treasures of the brocade kasaya and nine-ringed staff may be worn and wielded in this very life.\n\nYet Xuanzang must first obtain his three disciples before he can pay homage to the Tathāgata—this is easily understood. The three disciples had already attained the Dao of longevity, their life-roots firm and indestructible through ten thousand kalpas. Why, then, did they take Xuanzang as their master? This is difficult to fathom. The reason lies in the shared path of immortals and Buddhas: the Buddha speaks of the *\"seven-foot golden body,\"* while immortals speak of *\"cultivating two persons\"*—both are the progression from action to non-action. To perfect life without perfecting nature is like a precious mirror left unpolished, lacking radiance—this is not the true emptiness of action. To perfect nature without perfecting life is like building a house without a foundation, erecting pillars in vain—this is the barren emptiness of non-action. Thus, those who act must first see nature and illuminate the mind before transcending the Five Phases—this is why the three disciples took refuge in the Buddha’s Dharma. Those who do not act must gather the Five Phases before transcending the mundane and entering sagehood—this is why Xuanzang subdued the three disciples.\n\nThe three disciples had not fully realized the subtlety of non-action, yet Xuanzang embodied it—thus they took him as their master. Xuanzang had not fully realized the subtlety of action, yet the three disciples embodied it—thus he taught them as his disciples. When master and disciples unite as one, this is the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir, the supreme and most authentic Mahayana Dharma. Only after ascending the bottomless boat and shedding the husk do they achieve the mutual aid of master and disciples, where neither owes gratitude to the other—this is the original intent.\n\nThe Patriarch said: *\"Human life is like a bubble, an illusion. Without this bubble, this illusion, the great matter cannot be accomplished; but once the great matter is accomplished, what use is this bubble, this illusion?\"* Ascending the bottomless boat and shedding the husk is precisely when the great matter is accomplished—it is the golden cicada shedding its shell and transforming.\n\nThroughout the book, the master is styled as a \"Buddha-child\" and named *\"Xuan\"* (Mystery); the disciples are all \"immortal-children\" and named *\"Wu\"* (Awakening). Without awakening, there is no thorough mystery; without mystery, there is no thorough awakening. Immortals are Buddhas, Buddhas are immortals—there is no dual Dao, no dual function.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: Falling into the Tiger’s Den, the Metal Star Resolves the Crisis; At Twin-Fork Ridge, Boqin Shelters the Monk**\n\nWu Yizi said: Shun declared, *\"The human heart is perilous.\"* Zhuangzi said, *\"What is so impetuous and unbridled that it cannot be restrained? Is it not the human heart?\"* Perilous, impetuous, and unbridled—these deeply reveal the treacherous nature of the human heart. The *\"Five Sons’ Song\"* in the *Book of Documents* says, *\"Like driving six horses with rotten reins\"*—the six horses are a metaphor for the human heart.\n\nYet controlling horses depends on reins and bridles, while controlling the heart depends on reverence. Reverence is how the sage begins and completes the Way. Thus, in cultivating the Dao and learning the Way, the very first step upon setting out is to fully restrain the perilous nature of the human heart, lest one fall into its traps.\n\nThis chapter marks Tripitaka’s first step on his western journey. The assembled monks debated the purpose, each describing the hardships ahead. Tripitaka said: *\"When the heart arises, all manner of demons arise; when the heart is extinguished, all manner of demons are extinguished.\"* Some say these two lines succinctly capture the entire essence, leaving nothing more to be said.\n\nAlas! To mistake the human heart for the Dao-mind is to mistake the heart for the Dao, to take the false as real—this is a grave error! One must recognize that all within this heart is demonic and must be severed and eradicated at the root. Only through unyielding strength and resolute decisiveness can this be achieved. If extinguishing the heart were the full extent of the purpose, why then journey to the West to obtain the Mahayana true sutras?\n\nThis is the blindness of the fleshly eye, failing to recognize the true form of the living Buddha—the wondrous seven-foot golden body. It is like setting out and reaching the border of mountains and rivers, only to take the wrong path and suddenly lose one’s footing, tumbling into a pit.\n\nThe chapter vividly illustrates this, for the phrases *\"heart arises\"* and *\"demons arise\"* merely point out the perilous nature of the human heart, teaching one to strike first—this is the starting point. Tripitaka mistook these two as the very trap, and his heart’s panic was the tiger’s appearance.\n\nThe human heart is like a tiger: the tiger’s trap and the heart’s trap ensnare a person in the same way. What difference is there between falling into the heart’s den and the tiger’s den? How can this be seen?\n\nThe concluding verse says: *\"The white-browed king of South Mountain.\"* South is *li* (☲), corresponding to *bing* (丙), and the *bing* fire’s phase of growth begins in *yin* (寅)—the *yin* general. This clearly designates the *yin* general as the heart. Yet fearing that the world might not understand, the text introduces the two demons, the bear and the yaksha, as proof. The bear belongs to fire, born within *yin*; the yaksha belongs to earth, born within *bing*.\n\nThe demon king said: *\"They delivered themselves to my door.\"* This entirely depicts the peril of the human heart ensnaring itself.\n\nYet the human heart is more perilous than the two demons, though not perilous when unified as one. Thus the Mountain Lord said: *\"Devour the two, but spare the one—this may be done.\"* The Golden Star below signifies the original nature of the One. The two are the ordinary heart; the One is the Dao-heart. At this moment, Tripitaka sank into a stupor, lost and without mastery—unable to preserve his life. The way to preserve life rests solely upon the true One’s gold. *\"Suddenly, an old man appeared, staff in hand\"*—this is the original nature’s mastery, by which life may be preserved. Thus he thanked the old man for saving his life. The old man then asked: *\"Have you lost anything?\"* Tripitaka replied: *\"Two attendants were devoured, and I know not where my luggage and horse have gone.\"* The old man pointed and said: *\"Are not that a horse and two bundles?\"* Tripitaka turned to look, and indeed, they were his belongings—only then did his heart settle. Though these seem idle words, they carry essential meaning. For the *\"two attendants\"* are the ordinary heart, fallen into the trap and devoured; Tripitaka, having beheld the master, retains only the Dao-heart. The *\"one horse and two bundles\"* symbolize the Dao-heart—his original possessions, unlost, forming the foundation for his westward journey. Only then could his heart be at ease.\n\nThe Golden Star led him out of the pit and pointed ahead to divine disciples, further clarifying that with the Dao-heart present, one must steel the heart and press onward. Though others may aid, the path cannot be walked alone to its end. The old man said: *\"This is Twin-Fork Ridge, a den of tigers and wolves.\"* And again: *\"Only because your original nature is fundamentally luminous were they unable to consume you.\"* Such insights are profoundly clear.\n\nThreefold Basket, having encountered tigers and serpents, myriad demonic toxins—though knowing they arose from his own heart—found no means of deliverance. Alone and without recourse, he could only relinquish body and mind, surrendering to heaven’s decree. This was the moment when his original nature, fundamentally luminous, extinguished the human heart and temporarily preserved the celestial heart.\n\nYet this place was the crossroads where heavenly and mortal realms diverged, leaving him stranded amid towering ridges, neither able to advance nor retreat. The meaning of *\"Twin-Fork\"* echoed Mozi’s lament at the forked path, where one might turn southeast or northwest—where the White-Forehead King and Liu the Stalwart clashed in battle. Man and beast, vividly depicted, revealed the threshold between humanity and ferocity: only rectitude could dispel evil, only principle could overcome desire. If one could master reverence and self-restraint, cultivate courage and unyielding strength, then the heart’s demons would vanish, and one might feast on flesh and sleep upon hides.\n\n*\"Liu\"* signified the power to overcome the Yin and halt the slaughter; *\"Tai\"* (Stalwart) denoted the capacity to contend for leadership and uphold household governance; *\"Qin\"* (Reverent) meant inner humility and outward dignity, mastering reverence to sustain the self. *\"Wielding a rigid fork\"* symbolized inflexible strength, while *\"styled ‘Guardian of the Mountain’\"* signified unshakable composure—reverence resided not beyond the heart but within it, as a fellow villager. The practice of reverence began within filial piety, thus making him a filial son. Only through reverence could he dwell unharmed in the tiger’s den; only through filial devotion could he guard the desolate mountain without peril. Tigers and wolves became his daily fare, for strength sufficed to quell desire; reciting sutras fulfilled his filial duty of deliverance, for sincerity could reach even the unseen. The single word *\"reverence\"* was the bridge spanning safety and danger, ease and hardship.\n\nYet he remained bound to the tigers and wolves, unable to transcend the snares of the world; he could only guard this mountain, not venture beyond its borders. Arriving at Two-Boundary Mountain, he escaped fear and obstruction, for here lay the parting of heavenly and mortal paths—he could not press forward as one. This was called *\"able to detain the monk but unable to escort him.\"*\n\nAlas! The mountain lord devoured monks yet detained them, consuming two; the mountain guardian devoured tigers yet detained the monk, preserving one. Yet it was not the tiger that consumed him, but the monk who consumed himself; not Qin who detained him, but the monk who detained himself. As for Twin-Fork Ridge and Two-Boundary Mountain, one must discern: *\"Twin-Fork\"* as the path where man and beast contend, *\"Two-Boundary\"* as the way where nature and destiny advance or halt—these distinctions could not be ignored.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: The Mind-Ape Returns to Rectitude, the Six Bandits Vanish Without Trace**\n*Wu Yizi says:* The human heart is like weeds, the Dao-heart like fine grain. If one eradicates all mundane thoughts yet lacks sagely understanding, it is like clearing a field of chaff and barnyard grass—leaving it utterly barren. How then can one repay the debt of hunger? As the Patriarch said: *\"If the cauldron lacks the true seed, one merely boils an empty pot with water and fire.\"*\n\nThe *\"mind\"* in *\"mind-ape\"* refers to the Dao-heart. The Dao-heart is not the spirit of deliberation within the heart, but the spirit of essence and oneness within the Five Phases. Only by attaining this heart does one possess the true seed, which is why the Lord of Yu specially emphasized the Dao-heart’s subtlety, refinement, and singularity, faithfully holding to the mean’s mystery.\n\nReaders who mistake the human heart for the mind-ape, failing to recognize the Handsome Monkey King as the true seed of essence and oneness, are like those who take a parasitic wasp’s larva for their own child. Yet this heart remains bound to the Five Phases, still the root of birth and death’s cycle. Only by progressing from effort to effortlessness, forgetting both heart and Buddha, dissolving good and evil, does one attain the transcendent transformation of the supreme Mahayana, beyond the world.\n\nThe opening verse is the original text of the Perfected One of Purple Yang, each word a mani-jewel—it must be pondered deeply. The line *\"To know it, one must master the mindless decision\"* clearly points to the profound principle of not clinging to the heart. For the wonder of essence and oneness arises from emptiness, neither heart nor Buddha, but the formless true suchness, the bodiless true appearance—beginning in concentration, ending in utter oblivion; ever beginning, ever ending, indestructible through ten thousand kalpas.\n\nShould one cultivate reverence and refine the heart with utmost devotion, even with the great power of Bo Qin, one may only escape the jaws of the tiger—how could one transcend beyond the boundaries of the realms? Yet this matter is difficult to comprehend, hence the verse twice employs the character \"know\" to instruct: only by truly knowing can one truly practice.\n\nAs when Bo Qin, standing at the Mountain of Two Realms, saw the monkey pleading for rescue and asked, *\"How can I discern truth from falsehood?\"* The monkey replied, *\"It is true! I dare not deceive!\"*—echoing the Tathāgata’s vow: *\"I now pledge to ensure this matter for you, its fulfillment certain.\"* At the summit, six characters are boldly proclaimed, and the Monkey Spirit indeed emerges from the cave, bearing a profound principle beyond brush or ink. Only by knowing that the human heart must be extinguished and the Dao-heart must be born—extinguishing the human heart and birthing the Dao-heart—does the cultivation of the Way begin. Thus, rescuing the \"heart-monkey\" and renaming it *\"Pilgrim\"* marks the true knowing and the commencement of practice.\n\nThe first step in practice lies in subduing the tiger. *\"Beyond the Mountain of Two Realms, a fierce tiger suddenly appeared.\"* This tiger is not the tiger that ensnares the heart within, but the tiger that sustains the body without—hence the words, *\"Bring me clothes to wear.\"* At the sight of the Pilgrim, it prostrates in the dust, unmoving. The tiger’s nature is no longer wild, no different from the heart-monkey’s return to rectitude. Taking a garment becomes as one with the whole. The Pilgrim’s subduing of the tiger is the Tripitaka’s taming of the monkey—its significance is subtle indeed.\n\nWhen the Venerable Sun boasts of his *\"skills in subduing dragons and tigers,\"* he foreshadows the subduing of the dragon as the second step. The verse contains the line: *\"A hook of new moon pierces the dusk,\"* a phrase of exquisite beauty. Readers may pass it by as mere embellishment of twilight’s leisure, unaware that after subduing the tiger, the crescent moon’s form has already taken shape—this must not be overlooked!\n\nWhen Wukong debates the elder on their ages, he perceives the swift passage of time...\n\nThe Tang Monk and the elder trace their shared lineage, seeing self and other as one family. Master and disciples bathe, shedding grime in an instant to renew themselves; seeking needle and thread, they mend their faults even amid haste. All these depict the conduct of one returned to rectitude, yet hold no profound meaning.\n\nBut when suddenly six men burst from the roadside, roaring, *\"Leave your baggage—or we’ll spare not your life!\"*—here, the words *\"life\"* and *\"spare\"* carry a subtle truth. Earlier, at Twin-Fork Ridge, before the heart-monkey was subdued, one’s nature remained fundamentally luminous, yet life lacked a true master. Thus, one could only relinquish body and mind, entrusting them to Heaven’s decree. That life came from Heaven. Now, with the heart-monkey tamed, life bears a true seed—hence both *nature* and *life* are spoken of together. *\"Spare you and let you pass\"* means this life now depends on oneself. Though one may fall from the horse, the heart can rest easy in its affairs.\n\nThe heart is fundamentally empty, yet in truth, all things are complete within it. If the eye fixates on private gain, if thoughts arise from the bodily husk, this becomes a *private hoard*. But when one embodies the great and the public, gathering all beings into oneself, this becomes the *public treasury*. To neglect the public treasury while enriching the private hoard is to betray the lord and join the bandits—just as they say, *\"You have nothing at all, yet you come back demanding things from us!\"*\n\nThus, when the lord’s virtue is clear and bright, the six offices are harmonious; when the heart’s sovereign is at peace, the six officials fulfill their duties. The eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind—these are Heaven’s thieves. Men cannot see them, and the heart, lacking a master, is swayed: the eye sees and delights, the ear hears and rages, the nose smells and clings, the tongue tastes and craves, the mind conceives and desires, the body brims with cares. Thus, the bandits run rampant, plundering wantonly, and *nature* and *life* follow in their wake.\n\nAs the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: *\"The six entrances: the eye enters form, the ear enters sound, the nose enters scent, the tongue enters flavor, the body enters touch, the mind enters phenomena.\"* These six thieves are worldly bandits—all invited in when the master carelessly opens the door.\n\nWukong recognizes himself as the true master. *\"Standing firm in the center\"* means neither leaning nor drifting; *\"feigning ignorance\"* means unyielding strength. Wielding the weapon of wisdom, he extinguishes them all, strips them of their spoils, and repurposes them as clothing and provisions—this is using stillness to quell chaos, truth to vanquish falsehood. Unlike the human heart, which is disturbed by both mind and things, this is truly the thunderbolt’s might. If, in the moment, he had shown the slightest hesitation or mercy, it would have been like inviting thieves in—none escape unharmed. Hence he says, *\"If I don’t kill them, they’ll kill you.\"* This is the thunderous shout of one who has experienced body and mind!\n\nThe Tang Monk, unaware of the bandits’ malice, remains ever compassionate, unable to act decisively—this is what it means to *\"be unfit for monkhood, unworthy of the Western Heaven.\"* Thus, through Wukong’s words and deeds, the text portrays the endless harm wrought by a heart without a master.\n\nThe Tang Monk, his heart lacking resolve, yet claims *\"I’ll decide for myself\"*—this is throwing away his life in vain. He has already spoken his own doom; how can he fulfill his destiny? All stems from his inability to quietly observe and discern the unchanging unity of essence—hence Guanyin transforms into an old woman, bearing robes and hat, transmitting the spell, and pointing the way through delusion.\n\nThe old woman says, *\"These were originally my son’s.\"* And again, *\"My home is to the east; he must have gone there.\"*\n\nShe then says, *\"I’ll call him back to follow you.\"*\n\nNow, Wukong embodies the Dao-heart—he is the Metal Duke. The *Yi* speaks of what is easily let loose yet hard to subdue, easily lost yet hard to find. But since he was originally of my household, merely lodged in the West for a time, his return to the East already shows intent to return. One must recognize the call to *\"summon him back!\"* Thus, the *Awakening to Reality* says:\n\n*\"The Metal Duke was originally the Eastern House’s son,\nSent to the Western neighbor to lodge and take form.\"*\n\nRecognizing the *\"summons,\"* he returns to his dwelling to nurture and unite, taking the Maiden as kin—here, the old woman’s guidance is most clear.\n\nThe *\"gold-embedded flowered cap\"* is the Golden Tight Restraint, as previously explained. Now, an embroidered robe is added, along with the *\"True Spell of Settling the Heart\"*—this depicts the character *\"怀\"* (to cherish). The robe bears the cap; Metal belongs to the Western Four. To establish the heart and don them—is this not *\"怀\"*? The meaning of *\"怀\"* inherently contains the sense of departure, yet returning is already implied. Just as *\"cherishing the feudal lords\"* makes the realm stand in awe, or *\"cherishing the law\"* keeps it ever in mind, the Dao-heart naturally abides. Thus she says: *\"If he refuses to obey you, recite this spell—he will never dare leave again.\"* This is the one-word true spell, a truly wondrous formula.\n\nThe Dragon King urges Wukong to return to the Sangha, recounting the tale of Huang Shigong—showing that only with an empty heart can one attain the true fruit. The Bodhisattva teaches Wukong to turn back, entering the gate of tight restraint—showing that a single thought can take root. With no regret, one may press forward, and the Great Dao lies within sight.\n\nYet the Heart-Ape’s return to rectitude is a mutual awakening, not Wukong’s alone. For Wukong, it is the Heart-Ape of action, returning to rectitude by entering Xuanzang’s Buddhist gate. For Xuanzang, it is the Heart-Ape of non-action, returning to rectitude by gaining Wukong’s active Dao-heart.\n\nThe *\"Six Bandits\"* are everywhere beneficial, fully attesting to the Dao-heart. For Xuanzang, they nearly bring calamity—serving as whetstones for tempering. For Wukong, a single staff strike slays them—like gathering provisions for the Dao-path. It is said: *\"The Trackless One\"*—*\"踪\"* (track) lies within *\"no return,\"* while *\"无\"* (none) lies within *\"return to rectitude.\"* When one returns, all returns; when one is rectified, all is rectified. The Heart-Ape is truly the seed of reality.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: Serpents Coil at the Mountain, Gods Secretly Protect;\nThe Eagle’s Sorrow Gorge, the Mind-Horse’s Reins Are Gathered**\n\nWu Yizi says: The Tai Bai Immortal’s song declares:\n*\"Dragons emerge from whore-fire,\nTigers are born in water.\"*\n\nRegarding the Kan and Li of the body: it is clear that within yin there is yang, and within yang there is yin—the principle of yin-yang inversion. The heart is Li, yang, the dragon; the yin within Li is the tiger. The kidneys are Kan, yin, the tiger; the yang within Kan is the dragon. Only by subduing the tiger can the true water within Li descend and follow the dragon. Only by taming the dragon can the true fire within Kan rise and approach the tiger. This is called the *\"water and fire intermingling, Kan and Li coupling\"*—the first essential step in internal alchemy.\n\nThe previous chapter’s work of subduing the tiger was accomplished in the mountains; this chapter’s task of taming the dragon must be sought in the waters. *\"Snake-Coiling Mountain\"* depicts the body’s internal entanglements; *\"Eagle’s Sorrow Gorge\"* symbolizes the perilous ford where one is easily drowned.\n\nThe *\"fiendish dragon suddenly emerges to swallow the horse, then vanishes without a trace\"*—showing its elusive leaps and untamed ferocity. *\"Old Sun cannot bear his impatience, scolds the master for being a pushover\"*—showing that restraint has its methods, while fear and hesitation are of no use.\n\n*\"By Guanyin’s decree, the Metal Spirit secretly aids\"*—clarifying that quiet observation and discernment reveal the priority of preservation. *\"Lifting the tiger’s pelt, calling the loach to return the horse\"*—demands vigilant self-mastery, ensuring governance is never lax.\n\nThe *\"two locked in combat\"* resemble the meeting of the Zi and Wu hours. *\"Sanzang says: ‘The other day, when you struck the tiger, you claimed to have the skill to tame dragons and subdue tigers—why can’t you subdue this one today?’\"* Here, the taming of the dragon is explicitly raised, tightly paired with the previous chapter’s subduing of the tiger.\n\n*\"The Traveler arrives at the gorge, churning the waters like the Nine Bends of the Yellow River in flood.\"* The fiendish dragon, deep in the gorge, sits and lies in unrest. To subdue and still it, one must first rouse and stir it—this is the Daoist formula: *\"Flanks bent, waist curved, the Yellow River flows backward.\"* This is the method of striking and circulating, the key to taming the dragon. Otherwise, if left to its leaps and bounds, the dragon emerges from water, refusing to turn with the mind and heed our command—how then can it aid our Dao?\n\nOnly through ceaseless diligence, constant movement and stillness, can the true dragon be tamed. If it burrows into the grass, leaving no trace, it means the heels have rested, and progress halts. Thus, one must earnestly investigate, seeking its tracks and whereabouts, never allowing it to follow its own path and destroy the true mechanism. This is why the Monkey King, in his urgency, recites the spell, and the Earth Spirit reveals the dangers of the gorge.\n\n*\"Crows and sparrows dare not fly over, for the water is so clear they see their own reflections, mistaking them for their kin and often plunging in to drown.\"* This illustrates that those who do not recognize the true dragon in the water and seek to subdue it instead mistake the water for harmless and drown—just as crows and sparrows, ignorant, take their reflections for companions and plunge to their deaths.\n\nHeaven has set this sheer gorge, where even wings cannot cross—yet within lies the Black Pearl, urgently awaiting exploration. How then to begin?\n\nDirect the intent, tightly grasp the dragon’s horns, and bear the weight for distant conveyance. Swallow the white horse, and intent transforms into dragon; transform the white horse, and the dragon dissolves into intent. Follow intent in transformation, and the dragon’s nature becomes docile, obeying the heart’s every desire. Thus, upon seeing the *Bimawen*, control and release come effortlessly.\n\nYet to subdue the tiger, one must first subdue the ordinary tiger before the true tiger appears. The true tiger has no form—it takes the ape as its form. As when, in the previous episode, the tiger was slain and its skin flayed for clothing. To subdue the dragon, one must first subdue the dragon-like before the true dragon emerges. The true dragon has no appearance—it takes the horse as its appearance. As in this episode, when the horse was swallowed and its hide transformed into scales.\n\nThese dragon and tiger reside within the self—it is merely the foundation of inner cultivation. Should one seek to harmonize with the external Five Phases to achieve the Great Dao, then the *shen*-monkey must become the tiger, and the *hai*-pig must become the dragon. One must not cling to the text or fixate on images, mistaking false dragons and tigers and thus blundering blindly in practice.\n\nWhy then could the *Xingzhe* not subdue the dragon himself and had to enlist the *Jiedi* to summon the Bodhisattva? For the dragon is a creature of unyielding strength, and only the soft Way can approach it. The slightest impatience or coercion only rouses its nature further—only Guanyin’s effortless mastery can tame it. Just as before, when the tiger was subdued, it was through the effortless power of the floral crown that bound it. Thus, the moment the *Xingzhe* saw the Bodhisattva, he invoked the method of the floral crown to restrain his own demonic impulses. Even the sinful dragon labeled the *Xingzhe* a demon, yet neither could escape the bounds of effortless mastery.\n\nSubduing the unruly arises from effortlessness, yet journeying toward the Spirit Mountain demands action. The Bodhisattva declared, *\"Only when you obtain this dragon-horse can you proceed.\"* From this point forward, true vigorous progress begins. She summoned the young dragon and said, *\"When have I ever uttered even half the word ‘Tang’ to you?\"* How profound the intent! To remain ignorant of the origins of the scripture quest is to reach a dead end at this juncture. But to grasp its true purpose is to cross this shore and enter boundless prospects.\n\nThe Bodhisattva continued, *\"That monkey-headed fool relies solely on his own strength and refuses to praise others.\"* Some say this means he cannot empty himself, making it a demonic obstacle on the path of cultivation. Others claim the *Xingzhe* trusts only his own hasty courage and scorns the wisdom of others’ effortlessness. Neither is correct. This passage reveals the immortal master’s secret essentials of the Great Dao—a subtle method of transmitting the golden needle.\n\nThe *Daoist Canon*’s ten thousand scrolls speak only of the Mysterious Pass and the Female Gate. Laozi said, *\"The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth.\"* It clarifies the mechanism of yin and yang’s ebb and flow, their union and continuity, the root’s ingress and egress—what else could be the root of heaven and earth? Those who identify the Mysterious Female with mouth and nose, heart and kidneys, are mired in form and cannot speak of *\"as if preserved.\"*\n\nDong Sijing said, *\"Spirit is the convergence of qi.\"* Cao Daochong said, *\"The Mysterious conceals spirit in profound obscurity; the Female harbors qi in harmonious emptiness.\"* Yu Yuwu stated, *\"The two cavities of Kan and Li wondrously unite the two earths, blending spirit and qi without falling into names or appearances.\"* This comes closest to the truth.\n\nAlas! The subtleties of internal refinement have been exhausted here, yet all speak only of the individual body. It is like crows and sparrows crossing a ravine, mistaking their reflections for companions—inevitably leading to fatal error. How lamentable!\n\nThus the Perfected One said, *\"Do not cling to this body as the Dao,\"* for this is the error of *\"the monkey’s head stubbornly relying on its own strength.\"* Again he said, *\"Recognize the elixir of immortality in that other realm,\"* which is the truth of *\"how could one refuse to praise another?\"*\n\nThe following passage states: *\"This time, as we proceed, there will be those who submit. First raise the words ‘fetching the scriptures,’ and without straining the mind, they will naturally yield in reverence.\"* This profoundly clarifies that straining the mind cannot be spoken of as the Dao, while submission is the means to fetch the scriptures. Straining the mind is solitary cultivation of a single element; submission is the gathering of the Five Phases. It is not attained through empty speculation but arises from the true accumulation of righteousness.\n\n*\"The Bodhisattva plucked the small dragon’s luminous pearl and instructed him earnestly, ‘Apply yourself diligently. Only after achieving merit will you transcend the mundane and restore your golden body of fruition.’\"* This means that from now on, one must not rely on one’s own brilliance but must exert effort to succeed—take heed not to retreat or regret.\n\nMost wondrous of all is when *\"the Pilgrim seized the Bodhisattva and would not let go,\"* saying four times, *\"I will not go!\"* Why? Taming dragons and subduing tigers pertains only to the Kan and Li of the individual body. Even if one has laid the foundation and refined the self, one remains an ordinary mortal—how can this fulfill destiny and transcend the world?\n\nThus he said, *\"The Western Path is so treacherous. Guarding this mortal monk, when will we ever arrive? I will not go! I will not go!\"*\n\nHere the passage artfully presses forward to the marvel of the \"three families meeting and proceeding together.\" Every line of the Bodhisattva’s exhortation is spoken in plain truth, without parable. *\"Again, she bestowed a fundamental skill—plucking a willow leaf to transform into three life-saving hairs.\"* How profoundly subtle! The first three pertain to realizing nature, the inner lines of Qian; the latter three pertain to realizing destiny, the outer image of Qian. The first three and the latter three are ultimately the same, until all six lines become pure Qian, forging indestructible true gold—only then is the task complete. Yet the Pilgrim, taking the latter three as nature, truly embodies unfathomable transformation and boundless cyclicality. This is the very essence of great compassion and mercy, the fundamental intent of delivering the world and relieving suffering.\n\nWhen the Pilgrim and Tang Monk reached the stream’s edge, they saw an old fisherman poling a raft to ferry travelers across. This raft, though substantial, carries the mortal monk to transcend the mundane and realize nature; later, the Cloud-Soaring Ferry, steered by the Guiding Buddha, is the bottomless vessel that ferries the sage monk to realize destiny as a Great Sage. Thus it is said: *\"The vast true Suchness ascends the other shore; with sincere heart, nature is realized upon Vulture Peak.\"* This is the other shore of realizing nature, not the far bank of realizing destiny.\n\nUpon arriving at the village gate to seek lodging, they received a saddle from the Dharma-protecting horse and a whip made of tiger sinew. What he rides is a dragon; what he wields is a tiger—just as they set forth on the path. Hence the words: *\"The Bodhisattva bestowed saddle and bridle upon you. Strive diligently on the western journey; take care not to slacken or err.\"* Some say this signifies the mind-monkey returning to rectitude and the will-horse reined in, resolving seven or eight parts of the matter. Yet this merely glimpses the obstacles of mind and intent, without tracing the inner sanctum of nature and destiny! Such is the *\"fleshly eyes and mortal frame, bowing in gratitude yet failing to comprehend—how many past achievements were squandered, provoking the Great Sage’s uproarious laughter!\"* These half-hidden, half-revealed turns are most deceptive, hence the remark: *\"He truly deserved a thrashing.\"*\n\nNow, the meaning is clearly expounded: from the tangled heap, the treasure is plucked—pray, let all gather it, and spare yourselves the clout of old Sun’s golden cudgel.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: The Monks of Guanyin Monastery Scheme for the Treasure; The Monster of Black Wind Mountain Steals the Cassock**\n\nWu Yizi says: The Great Dao is profoundly subtle, its wonder lying in quiet observation and close scrutiny. With a pair of wisdom-eyes, one perceives that a thousand threads and ten thousand strands are but one affair—lest illusory shadows and empty flowers obscure the true essence and real meaning. These three chapters all prepare for the nineteenth, where Tian Peng is subdued, embodying the essentials of cultivating truth. Fearing that the world would not recognize this, the immortal master raises the banner of *\"observation,\"* threading it through the three chapters from beginning to end. One must observe both inception and conclusion; this must not be overlooked.\n\nIn this chapter, the folly of solitary cultivation of a single thing is made clear, and the perils of cunning and treachery leading to self-destruction must be known. The brocade cassock, a treasure of the heavens, is the color and form of the golden elixir. Only through accumulating virtue and amassing benevolence, radiating brightness and uprightness, honoring teachers and esteeming friends, and guiding through silent enlightenment may one hope for its reward. If one resorts to scheming and deceit, thinking only of oneself and not others, flaunting strength and cunning, and habitually straying into side paths—such are the ranks of wolfish schemers and rat-like thieves. They seek not longevity but hasten their own demise!\n\nThus, the root of cultivating truth most abhors a scheming mind. Of old, Master Duanmu encountered an old man by the Han River, who embraced a jar to irrigate his garden. Pitying his labor, Duanmu taught him to use a well-sweep. The old man said: *\"I have heard that those who employ machinery must engage in mechanical affairs, and those who engage in mechanical affairs must harbor a mechanical mind. When a mechanical mind resides in the breast, purity and whiteness are no longer whole; when purity and whiteness are incomplete, the spirit is unsettled; when the spirit is unsettled, the Dao cannot bear it. I am not ignorant of this—I am ashamed to do it.\"* Duanmu hung his head in shame. The old man continued: *\"You are about to forget your spirit and qi, cast off your bodily form, and only then may you approach it! If you cannot govern your own person, how can you govern the world? Begone, and do not hinder my work!\"* For he detested excessive scheming.\n\nThe monk struck the bell and laughed, saying, *\"You wouldn’t understand—this is ‘as long as I’m a monk for a day, I’ll strike the bell for a day.’\"* He added, *\"It was your grandfather Sun who taught me to strike it for fun.\"* This is what it means to follow conditions and accept one’s lot, to harbor no scheming mind, to play along with the occasion, and to embody the uncontrived delight of Heaven—true joy in forgetting all calculation. This stands in stark contrast to the old monk below, who stirred wicked intentions, with Broad Wisdom and Broad Scheming endlessly weighing gains and losses, each deploying their cunning.\n\nThe Dao is not beyond planning, yet there is oneself and others—when self and others are united as one, what one seeks is upright. Seeking uprightness is called *vital impulse*; where vital impulse abides, life endures. But if the old monk sought personal gain at others’ expense, he walked the path of perversion. Walking perversion is called *deadly impulse*; where deadly impulse reigns, destruction follows.\n\nThe Dao is not beyond stealing, yet to rob Heaven and Earth, to pilfer the workings of Creation without harm to either side or injury to the whole—this is called *knowing the mechanism*. Knowing the mechanism is *Heaven’s mechanism*; Heaven’s mechanism is spirit. But when the black bear seized the opportunity to stealthily carry things away, this was called *riding the mechanism*. Riding the mechanism is *human mechanism*; human mechanism is demonic. The absence of mechanism appears in spontaneity; human mechanism arises from contrivance.\n\nLike the old monk who, once the cassock was in hand, wept bitterly by lamplight—Broad Wisdom and Broad Scheming’s schemes, fire attacks, and lethal force—this was human mechanism, riding the mechanism, walking perversion, and self-destruction. Yet with a numinous mind at work and seated awareness, hearing the crackle of firewood, he knew harm was afoot. Turning the tables, he ascended to the Southern Heavenly Lad to borrow the fire-repelling cloak, shielding Tang Monk while ignoring the rest. Where fire aids wind, this thing comes from illumination, harmonious yet not initiating—this was knowing the mechanism, Heaven’s mechanism, seeking uprightness to dispel perversion.\n\nIn this chapter, the two appearances of *\"a honeybee\"* devise a method, teaching one to observe closely and quietly, to recognize the error of harming others for personal gain, and the Dao’s counterstrike—how the Metal Duke cannot lack the Wood Mother. Tang Monk’s words, *\"Do not compete in wealth with others,\"* are the deep concealment of a wise merchant. The crowd’s words, *\"You only harm yourself,\"* are the self-invited consequences of fortune and misfortune. Though the admonitions are many, none hit the mark. Only by reading this closely can one grasp the art of narrative.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: Sun the Pilgrim Raises Havoc on Black Wind Mountain; Guanyin Subdues the Bear Spirit**\n\n*Wu Yizi says:* The *Cantong Qi* states, *\"Right and wrong pass through the viscera; inner observation yields reflection.\"* It speaks of the treasure of true yin and true yang, which cannot be obtained merely by scrutinizing the five viscera or scheming in thought. The old monk of the previous chapter, dwelling in Guanyin Monastery, schemed to seize the cassock—this was like inwardly observing the heart and employing the mind to plot. Little did he know that scheming with the mind stokes the heart-fire to a blaze, burning the heart-fire itself. Inevitably, it becomes a vast fire pit; not only does water fail to quell the flames, but the true treasure sinks into the lower field, just as the black bear stole away the cassock. This is the harm of misusing the mind’s mechanism. Thus, the opening laments: *\"Cursed be that old skinflint who knew not men, scheming with his heart—today he has only harmed himself.\"* This is a sobering revelation.\n\nYet to abandon the method of observing the mind and forcefully direct effort toward the kidneys is to cling to the superficial talk of refining cinnabar and mercury—a mere side door, an external path! This black fellow is none other than the demon of the lower field. The Daoist is his qi, hence named *\"Soaring Void\"*; the scholar is his essence, hence clad in white. Calling it the *\"Buddhist Robe Assembly\"* shows they recognize only the name’s surface, not its inner reality. *\"Black Wind Mountain, Black Wind Cave\"* depicts the color of the Water Palace’s qi; *\"iron helmet, black armor, dark robe, black boots\"* shape the form of the Kan Palace. The Pilgrim’s entire account aligns with the essential aim of cultivating truth.\n\nOnly the line *\"He said his body held elixir pills, but seeking them outside is futile toil\"* directly condemns those who focus on the kidneys, refining mercury and extraction—an unlawful practice. It closely anticipates the later chapter where Tian Peng’s self-rescue represents the true, original, and natural union. *\"The monster and the Pilgrim fought until the red sun stood at noon, then withdrew to eat.\"* This is the time when kidney qi wanes at noon and heart-blood flourishes, like closing the gate to draft a letter, inviting the venerable Gold Pond. *\"Humble one\"* denotes subordination; *\"Venerable One\"* denotes superiority. The meaning is clear.\n\nThe bear and black ape belong to fire yet appear as black men—these are the flames of desire within the kidneys; the Gold Pond belongs to wood yet is called the Cinnabar Chamber—this is the lustful fluid within the heart. Each has its season of encounter and can even offer mutual benefit, forming alliances. Drawn together by kindred qi, they say: *\"Transmit to him some qi-absorption methods.\"*\n\nThe Immortal Master, fearing readers might misconstrue the previous monk as an impure mind, thus has the Pilgrim transform into a monk to clarify that the monk is none other than the Mind-Ape. *\"Entering the cave, observing its couplets, a place of profound stillness and seclusion\"*—this originally describes the realm of understanding destiny. Yet those who practice the demonic arts of extraction without comprehending the spiritual union of intercourse fail to know destiny.\n\nAfter the deception is exposed and battle resumes, victory and defeat remain undecided. The Pilgrim says: *\"I’m not much harder—let’s just call it an even match.\"* For the Pilgrim’s unyielding strength is like true gold, while the bear’s obstinate rigidity is like crude iron. Gold and iron do not merge, their banners and drums perfectly matched. Yet stubborn iron can be transmuted into gold—it simply lacks the alchemy of refinement to be gathered.\n\nThus, the journey to the Southern Sea to seek Guanyin is introduced, making clear that the method of subjugation must still be sought in the realm of contemplative freedom. Observe the marvel of subjugation: no longer forcing the scholar to slither like a snake, but simply snapping him in two, turning white into a face; no longer allowing the mess of filling earth, but cleaving the head into a cake, transforming black into cinnabar.\n\n*\"Seeing the words ‘Crafted by Lingxuzi’ at the bottom of the tray, the Pilgrim laughed: ‘Fortune! Fortune!’\"*—for beneath these words lay the mechanism of destiny. Thus, the Bodhisattva seizes the opportunity, using the ploy to reclaim the kasaya. The immortal elixir cannot be formed apart from this, yet its function was misapplied, burying the treasure. Now, employing the very method of the other against himself, there is no need to rekindle the furnace and bell, sparing further toil. Why? True and false differ by but a single thought, yet fundamentally share the same principle. If one can master spiritual transformation, this can become that, and that can become this—this is the harmonizing elixir-head, the subtle workings of destiny in silent communion.\n\nThus, the Bodhisattva may transform into a demon, and the demon remains the Bodhisattva, revealing that self and other share a single source, never clashing. This sets the stage for the later self-mating of Metal Lord and Original Mother, who cannot bear even momentary separation. The Pilgrim eats the two immortal elixirs first—what is false can be transformed by the true; the Pilgrim then transforms anew—what is true shifts with the false. Transformation is boundless, concealment and revelation unfathomable, one becoming two, two becoming one—all is ultimately nothingness.\n\nThe moment the Pilgrim swallows the elixir, the demon is subjugated, demonstrating the principle of responsive spiritual communion. *\"Already exited through the nostrils\"*—showing the swiftness of transference. *\"The Pilgrim, fearing delay, wished to strike him dead\"*—this is *\"no merit, yet merit lies within merit.\"* *\"The Bodhisattva hastily stopped him, saying: ‘I have use for him elsewhere.’\"*—this is *\"having use, yet use is no use.\"*\n\n*\"The black man vowed to attain the true fruit; the Bodhisattva touched his crown and administered the precepts. Today, a wild heart is settled, and endless obstinacy is reined in\"*—gaining the heart of freedom while restraining the desires of the senses, as circumstances dictate. The kasaya, lost and then recovered, the bear and ape return directly to the great sea, and the Black Wind Cave is transformed into a monastery for the beholder.\n\nChapter Eighteen: The Tang Monk Escapes Peril at Guanyin Monastery; The Great Sage Subdues the Demon at Gaolao Village\n\nWu Yizi observes: The *Book of Changes* states, *\"Heaven and earth intermingle in misty vapor, and the myriad things transform into purity. Male and female unite in essence, and the myriad things come to life.\"* It clarifies that yin and yang employ union as their function. When heaven and earth unite, it is *Tai* (Peace); when mountains and marshes communicate, it is *Xian* (Mutual Joy); when water and fire merge, it is *Jiji* (Completion). Sometimes yin seeks yang, sometimes yang seeks yin; sometimes yang stirs and yin responds, sometimes yin moves and yang follows—only then can transformation and generation occur. From flying birds to hidden fish, from moving beasts to rooted plants, each possesses male and female, all following the Dao of one yin and one yang. If yin stands alone and yang is lacking, or yang stands alone and yin is lacking, then the qi of yin and yang becomes isolated and fails to unite—how can generation and transformation arise?\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* states, *\"If a hen hatches an egg alone, her chick will not be whole.\"* It also says, *\"If two women share a chamber, though their beauty be exquisite, even with Su Qin and Zhang Yi as matchmakers, their hair will rot and their teeth decay—ultimately, they will never know one another.\"* This principle is abundantly clear.\n\nThe Dao of Laozi and Zhuangzi fundamentally derives from the *Book of Changes*. Thus, Laozi says, *\"The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth. Though it seems to endure ceaselessly, its use is inexhaustible.\"* And, *\"All creatures emerge from it, and wriggling things none fail to follow.\"* Zhuangzi says, *\"Supreme yin is solemn and still; supreme yang blazes and glows.\"* He also says, *\"Though the corpse abides in stillness, the dragon appears; though the abyss is silent, thunder resounds. When the spirit moves, heaven follows.\"* For yin and yang, movement and stillness, each is the root of the other, and the Supreme Ultimate rides within them.\n\nIf one can embody the Supreme Ultimate, then the heavenly gate rests in the hand, and the earthly axis arises in the heart—this is the attainment of immortals, buddhas, and sages. But if a single thought errs, then movement and stillness alike depart from the heavenly principle; thus, the noble person values vigilance in solitude and introspection. If a single affair leans to one side, then movement and stillness alike lose their center; thus, the noble person values the investigation of things and the extension of knowledge. If one cannot investigate things and extend knowledge, but instead clings to one-sided yin or yang, cultivating only a single aspect—how can one become an immortal or buddha and transcend the mundane to enter sagehood?\n\nChen Niuwan says, *\"There is something strange yet stranger still: the affinity of heart and kidney is not Kan and Li.\"* Yuanduzi says, *\"The primordial qi of pre-heaven comes from the realm of emptiness. A single spark of yang essence is hidden within the mountain of form—not in the heart or kidney, but within the mysterious pass of the single aperture.\"* If scholars do not recognize yin and yang, do not know the proper timing, and cannot return to the source, but instead grope about within themselves, mistaking the flickering, luminous consciousness for the true reality, they will err again and again.\n\nAlas! The Dao cannot be sought externally, nor can it be grasped by groping within oneself. It is profoundly mysterious and difficult to perceive. Those false masters who mislead their disciples, recklessly conjecturing that it is the art of bedroom alchemy or inner elixirs, stray ever further from the truth. The immortal master outlines the essentials, specifically revealing Laozi and Zhuangzi’s lofty and wondrous Dao—hence the name *\"Gaolao Village.\"*\n\nIn the previous two chapters: one depicts the heart’s biased movement and the blazing of fire; the other, the kidney’s biased movement and the flaring of qi. Neither is the Dao, but rather calamity. If one mistakenly regards these two as the Dao, one falls into bias and encounters misfortune. Only by departing from this view can one escape this peril.\n\n*\"The Pilgrim turned the Black Wind Cave into a Cave of Crimson Wind\"*—this is transforming a dark chamber into a realm of light, leaving a land of misfortune to ascend a mound of blessing. As master and disciples journey, spring’s warmth unfolds. The verses with *\"mandarin ducks\"* and *\"butterflies\"* depict the scene of paired flight in settled union—an exquisite depiction of yin and yang in harmonious union.\n\nThe most awakening moment lies in the passage where the place name is inquired. Wherever the Pilgrim goes, he never treats asking the name of a place as an urgent matter.\n\nHere the repeated questioning is deliberate—if this place is indeed the true domain of Laozi and Zhuangzi, one cannot but investigate it with utmost care. To clarify this point is to *\"grant convenience to others and to oneself.\"*\n\nThe subtlety lies in the two phrases: *\"asking others brings no pleasure, but asking him yields commerce.\"* For to ask others is to stray from the Dao of Gao Laozhuang; to ask him, however, reveals the marvel of exchange and transaction. Later, when the Pilgrim sees the demon, he remarks, *\"So this is the trade!\"*—his heart already comprehends, echoing the earlier insight.\n\nHe says, *\"This land on the border of the Ü-Tsang kingdom is called Gao Laozhuang.\"* The crow embodies the essence of the sun; the hare, the essence of the moon. In Ü-Tsang, the hare manifests, and through their mutual resonance, the boundary becomes distinct. The lofty origins of Laozi and Zhuangzi lie precisely here. The revelation that a daughter has *\"taken in a demon as son-in-law\"* is the very subtlety of their Dao.\n\nTo give a daughter in marriage is called *\"marrying off,\"* while to take a man into the family is called *\"taking in.\"* The Dao of Laozi and Zhuangzi excels in managing yin and yang—not by following the natural course, but by reversing it. Proceeding in sequence, ordinary fathers and mothers produce mortal offspring; reversing the process, numinous father and mother give rise to immortals. A woman taking a man as her mate is like the moon receiving the sun’s light to shine. Thus, Daoists use the moon to symbolize the Dao’s essence—its meaning is abundantly clear.\n\nWhen master and disciples are introduced, the elder states that his third daughter, Cuilan, has taken in a son-in-law from Mount Fuling. *\"Third daughter\"* signifies the marvel of the youngest; *\"Fuling\"* suggests blessings as vast as a mound—implicitly evoking the trigram *dui* (joyful maiden) and *gen* (resolute strength). Fearing the Pilgrim’s ugliness, the elder remarks, *\"Ugly he may be, but he has skill.\"* He also notes that the son-in-law’s appearance and conduct are strange. The Pilgrim replies, *\"When night falls, we shall see the truth.\"* All this depicts the worldly habit of judging by outward appearances, unaware that beneath coarse robes may lie jade, or within an old clam, a pearl—hidden within are the wondrous openings to immortality and Buddhahood.\n\nThe Pilgrim, weapon in hand, shatters the demon’s barrier and calls out, *\"Summon your daughter—is she within?\"* The old man calls his daughter forth, who weeps as she describes the demon’s erratic behavior: *\"He vanishes like mist, leaving no trace.\"* One must seek the true form of one’s daughter in solitude and retrieve the whereabouts of one’s son-in-law from the depths of delusion—yet one must not cling to superficial traces and overlook the reversal of husband and wife.\n\n*\"The Pilgrim transformed himself to resemble the woman\"*—this is not a change of form, but the revelation of his true form. Why? The primordial *yi* qi is metal within water, outwardly yin but inwardly yang. In essence, he is female; thus, in terms of external yin, the Pilgrim becomes the wife—this is principle. Readers, take note: the immortal master explicitly identifies the Pilgrim as female, not as a transformed guise. The subsequent dialogue—feigned illness, sighs, and entreaties—faithfully captures the intimate exchanges of a married couple.\n\nOld Sun as the wife, Old Zhu as the husband—truly a pair heaven-made and earth-matched, a flawless and proper lady. All this is real meaning, though it may appear as playful illusion. When the Pilgrim reveals his identity as the Great Sage who wreaked havoc in Heaven five hundred years prior, Old Zhu immediately recognizes his origins and knows he can be subdued—he flees at once. The Pilgrim pursues relentlessly, like an eagle seizing a hare, like a cat pouncing on a mouse—such is the nature of their bond. *\"The karmic tie forged five hundred years ago\"*—their union was predestined, unbreakable. Let us proceed to the next chapter for a fuller account.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: Wukong Subdues Bajie in Cloud Ladder Cave; Tripitaka Receives the Heart Sutra at Floating Pagoda Mountain**\n\nWu Yizi observes: From the sixteenth chapter at Guanyin Monastery to this Cloud Ladder Cave, the interplay of metal and wood unfolds—the grand workings of true yin and true yang. Only thus does one open the gateways of the heart without falling into emptiness. This is *\"true emptiness\"*—empty yet not empty, precisely what the *Heart Sutra* means by *\"form is emptiness, emptiness is form.\"*\n\nHence, the chapter’s outline pairs *\"Wukong subdues Bajie\"* with *\"Tripitaka receives the Heart Sutra\"* as a tight parallel. To *\"subdue Bajie\"* is to receive the *Heart Sutra*. *\"Cloud Ladder\"* is the chariot of Heaven; *\"Floating Pagoda\"* is the ladder transcending Earth. Ascending from lower learning to higher attainment, step by step, one moves from effortful action to effortless Dao—this is the ultimate aim.\n\nThe Monkey of *shen* belongs to Metal, and Metal engenders Water—west four and north one, together making one-five. The Pig of *hai* belongs to Wood, and Wood engenders Fire—east two and south three, together making one-five. Within these two fives, *wu* and *ji* naturally merge into one-five.\n\nWithin yang there is yin; within yin there is yang.\nWithin generation there is restraint; within restraint there is generation—\nwhat is called \"taking turns as guest and host, mutually serving as husband and wife.\"\n\nIn the ordinary sequence of the Five Phases:\nWood and Fire belong to yang and serve as husband;\nMetal and Water belong to yin and serve as wife.\nThe Monkey is wife;\nthe Pig is husband.\n\nIn the inverted sequence of the Five Phases:\nwithin yang lies true yin, which is wife;\nwithin yin lies true yang, which is husband.\nThe Monkey is wife, yet in truth husband;\nthe Pig is husband, yet in truth wife.\nTrue yin and true yang find their subtlety in *wu* and *ji*.\n\nThus it is said: the essence of the three and the five wondrously converges and coalesces.\nThe *Doctrine of the Mean* states: \"The Way of the noble person begins with the relationship between husband and wife; at its utmost, it is discerned throughout Heaven and Earth.\"\nIf one grasps the word *\"utmost\"* as the utmost of exhausting one’s nature and fulfilling one’s destiny, enlightenment is already present in that very understanding.\n\nOrdinary people do not follow the central Way, stubbornly clinging to partial yin or partial yang. Blindly cultivating and recklessly refining, they neither recognize the Dao nor attain it—\nhow pitiable, how lamentable!\n\nAt the chapter’s opening, \"flames coalesce to manifest form\"—the Pig embodies the vital essence of the Southern Dipper’s generative *qi*, the radiant hue of the Li Palace. The \"nine-toothed iron rake\" marks the yang number reaching its apex at nine, the very image of true yin; its operation turns with the rake, entrusted entirely to the *qi*-mechanism of bearing and movement.\n\nOld Pig’s account of his self-rescue mirrors Monkey’s own self-narration, with phrases like \"pairing yin and yang,\" \"dividing sun and moon,\" \"harmonizing dragon and tiger,\" and \"drawing in the Golden Crow\" all distilling the marrow of the Nine-Cycled Great Return Elixir. When Monkey engages him in fierce battle yet does not immediately subdue him, instead withdrawing their forces to their respective sides, he subtly highlights the three characters \"Gao Family Village\" to redirect attention to the original theme—why? Lest the world mistake victory in battle for true excellence, unaware that the highest good lies in subduing others without fighting! Here, the Dao of the Golden Elixir reveals itself as no mere art of seductive song.\n\nMonkey recounts how \"Tian Peng descended to the mortal realm, having mistakenly entered the wrong womb, yet his numinous nature remained intact.\" He adds, \"For a celestial deity to take such a son-in-law hardly tarnishes the family’s reputation.\" This shows the upright *qi* of yin and yang, incomparable to mundane malevolent spirits, thus setting up the following line: \"It’s only that there were no matchmakers or witnesses to mediate.\" Why so? The union of husband and wife depends entirely on go-betweens; without them, natures fail to harmonize. This is precisely what the *Cantong Qi* means by \"those without shared speech are no kin.\" Thus Monkey resumes the challenge, declaring, \"You don’t resemble one who forcibly seizes another’s daughter without matchmakers or witnesses\"—his intent directly foreshadowing the water monster Sha Monk as the go-between ahead, while here planting the notion to elucidate how marital discord arises from such causes. Profound and intricately woven, this meaning is unparalleled. Yet readers dismiss it as mere banter, casually glancing past, burying its depth.\n\nMonkey pressed further, inquiring whether the rake was truly from Squire Gao’s household. Pig boasted of it as iron personally forged by Lord Lao, bestowed by Laozi himself—both claims truthful. \"Yet it could not so much as scratch my scalp,\" for wood cannot overcome metal. Upon hearing of the journey to the Western Heaven to seek the scriptures, Pig relinquished his rake. Why? Having received Avalokiteśvara’s clear decree, he knew that clinging solely to the rake was a one-sided attachment, incompatible with attaining true fruition—what is called \"abandoning the self to follow others\" rather than relying solely on one’s own strength. Thus he said, \"Why not have spoken sooner of the scripture-seeking matter, instead of relying on brute force to batter at my door?\" This precisely echoes the moment when Monkey subdued the young dragon, when the bodhisattva remarked, \"That monkey-head relies entirely on his own strength and refuses to praise others.\"\n\nWith sincere resolve, Pig burned his den, surrendered his weapon, bound himself, and pledged allegiance—for wood, by nature compliant and righteous, yearns for metal, just as crooked wood submits to the carpenter’s line to be made straight. Within these eight verses, the principles of metal and wood generating and overcoming one another are expounded, as are the dynamics of guest and host in harmonious exchange. When husband and wife are not estranged, their natures and dispositions remain unopposed—this is the very inception of the Western Paradise’s bliss.\n\nUpon their return after subduing Pig, Squire Gao recognized his son-in-law, and Tripitaka rejoiced in gaining a disciple, bestowing the name \"Eight Precepts.\" With evil cast aside and rectitude embraced, a feast could now be prepared to celebrate their reunion. In what follows, \"Eight Precepts seized Squire Gao, inviting my humble wife\" reveals how hard it is to sever karmic ties; \"Monkey and Eight Precepts drank the vegetarian wine\" shows how easily one succumbs to fermented brews; \"Accepting a single thread, ten thousand kalpas of cultivation are undone\" illustrates the heavy burdens of material gain; \"If the scripture quest fails, I’ll return to be a son-in-law\" exposes the fragility of the resolve for the Way; and again, \"Lest some mishap occur, the monk’s vows be broken, the wife’s marriage be lost\" reveals the futility of blind, misguided practice. Every line is a child’s song of admonition—do not dismiss it as mere idle jest.\n\nThe three disciples took their leave and set forth toward the west. The verse within—\"With harmony of disposition and settled nature, all conditions converge; when the moon fills the golden flower, the hair is shorn\"—its first line alludes in passing to the recruitment of Eight Precepts, while the second heralds the reception of the *Heart Sutra*. For once Eight Precepts was subdued, the golden elixir took form, and so, having passed the border of Ü-Tsang, they encountered the Bird’s Nest Chan Master. Why? The sun west and moon east mark the division of the twin orbs’ illumination...\n\nThe crow hidden in darkness, the hare revealed in light—these are but the radiant interplay of a single qi. When conditions converge and the moon waxes full, this is the true essence. The luminous moon of Chan mind may thus be verified. This *Heart Sutra* scroll appears precisely here, like the crow concealed within the moon, bright and unstained. In its transmission of secret truths, it points the way through delusion—here lies the crux.\n\nTripitaka bowed and inquired about the road ahead. The Chan Master replied, \"The path is long, and the journey’s end will come, but demonic miasmas are not so easily dispelled.\" Thus he bestowed the *Heart Sutra*, for it alone could dissolve such afflictions. Yet the sutra held no direct signpost to the Western Heaven, so he concluded, \"This is the comprehensive scripture of true cultivation, the gateway to Buddhahood.\"\n\nTripitaka, still grasping for answers, pressed further about the way to the West. The Chan Master had already made it plain, saying, \"Ask that acquaintance of yours—he knows the road west.\" Monkey, understanding, gave a cold laugh. \"No need to ask him—ask me instead.\" Tripitaka failed to grasp his meaning.\n\nThe exchange that followed—Tripitaka seizing Monkey’s words—was the very question he sought to ask. Monkey said, \"He insulted my brother and me.\" This was a veiled answer to the road west. Tripitaka replied, \"He spoke of the western path—when did he insult you?\" One took it as an insult pointing the way; the other heard only directions, not abuse. Master and disciple, question and response—all was Chan subtlety, every word a revelation. One must awaken swiftly.\n\nMonkey said, \"You wouldn’t understand: ‘A wild boar carrying a load’—that was an insult to Eight Precepts. ‘An old stone monkey of many years’—that was an insult to me. How could you possibly grasp his meaning?\" To say *\"You wouldn’t understand\"* was to demand understanding; to say *\"How could you grasp it?\"* was to demand comprehension.\n\nThe Chan Master’s words—*\"He knows the road west\"*—were a charge to Monkey to relay the message. Monkey’s *\"Ask me instead\"* was his acceptance of that charge. All was already clear.\n\nEight Precepts said, \"The divine master knows all past and future.\" He had spoken plainly enough. \"But let’s see if his words—‘You’ll meet water monsters ahead’—prove true.\" Ah! How wondrous!\n\nOh, how profound! Though many demonic miasmas lie ahead on the journey, why single out only the phrase *\"water monsters ahead\"*? In the mouths of those two, the great road to the Western Heaven was already laid bare—why should Tripitaka ask further?\n\nIn Chapter Twenty, *\"Tang Monk in Peril on Yellow Wind Ridge, Pig in the Vanguard at Mid-Mountain,\"* Wu Yizi says: This passage makes clear that once one has received the *Heart Sutra*, one must act swiftly, lest one mistake the mind for the Dao and thus obstruct one’s own progress.\n\nThe opening verse speaks of the practitioner of the Dao having a method—one that arises from the mind and is extinguished by the mind. But who is it that gives rise to the method, and who extinguishes it? One must discern this clearly for oneself. If one claims that all is but one’s own mind, then why rely on the words of others? One need only apply effort to the mind itself—yet this is like trying to twist iron into blood, to knot the void into form, and to expect effortless attainment. Such a path is utterly impossible. This is to mistake the thief for one’s own child—how could one ever reach the state where both mind and dharma are forgotten?\n\nOne must recognize that there exists an immortal elixir beyond such delusions. Do not let it deceive you. First, see through the five phases, shatter all obstacles with a single blow, and strive until the mind becomes no-mind, whereupon the dharma will naturally cease. Only then is it like the autumn moon in a clear sky—undivided, with both nature and destiny fulfilled.\n\nIf one claims that the mind is already the Buddha yet fails to recognize that it is neither mind nor Buddha, misinterpreting the verse *\"Since all is already the mind, why rely on the words of others?\"* as a command to rely solely on oneself, has one not strayed from the true gate? Thus, the text begins: *\"This verse is how Master Xuanzang awakened to the* Heart Sutra *and opened the gate.\"* If the mind were truly the Dao, and the Dao required nothing more, why speak of merely *\"opening the gate\"*? Why would he still journey westward to seek the true scriptures? Are the true scriptures of the Western Heaven not the teachings of others? This reasoning is clear and awakening!\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* says: *\"Qian and Kun are the gates of the* Yi.\"* Wukong and Wuneng are the gates of the *Yi*, and thus the gates of the *Heart Sutra*. To attain Wukong and Wuneng is to open the gate. Only then can one proceed with cultivation and enter the inner sanctum.\n\nEarlier, Chan Master Crow’s Nest, fearing that Tripitaka did not recognize the gate of the *Heart Sutra*, pointed to the *\"wild boar\"* and the *\"old stone monkey,\"* prompting Monkey to speak. The Elder understood the meaning, and so he recited and contemplated it constantly. A single spark of numinous light shone through—clearly the realm of *\"the setting sun conceals the fire mirror, the rising moon reveals the ice wheel.\"* The Great Dao lies ahead; one must press onward swiftly.\n\nIf one merely gropes within one’s own mind, mistaking the luminous and ever-aware consciousness for the true reality, unaware of the great road to the Western Heaven, one is like a ghost clinging to home—what is this but a *\"home-clinging ghost\"*? How can one transcend the mundane? Thus, the ancients mocked those who preserved their youth and dwelled in the world yet could not shed their shells and ascend, calling them *\"corpse-clinging ghosts.\"* Their folly is much the same.\n\nWhen Monkey says *\"your family’s ghost,\"* he scorns all those who cling to the mind in their practice. Tripitaka says: *\"Wuneng, if your heart were still so heavy with attachment to home, you would not have left it. You should return.\"* Though these words seem to reproach the fool without remorse, was Monkey truly slandering the idiot? No—he was using the fool to illustrate how clinging to the mind in cultivation is like leaving home yet still longing for it.\n\nObserve how the fool *\"comes with a dead heart, resolutely\"*—to come with a dead heart is still a method of the mind, yet to apply effort, one must have skill. But if one has only a dead heart without skill, every step will be thorny, and the path forward will be blocked. Thus, the old man shakes his head and waves his hand, saying: *\"You cannot go to the Western Heaven; you cannot obtain the scriptures.\"* Yet when Monkey reveals his true abilities, the old man says: *\"You must have some skill.\"* And again: *\"With such skill, you may yet reach the West.\"* This is the wondrous truth of Laozi and Zhuangzi.\n\nThus, the old man is made the master. The subsequent passage—*\"south of the village, two young men with an old woman, three or four children\"*—is but a shadow, the esoteric essence of Laozi’s *Daode* and Zhuangzi’s *Nanhua*, a tale that startles the foolish and shocks the vulgar, yet is the great skill for reaching the West.\n\nWhen Pig mentions *\"back in Gao Village, I often terrified mortals,\"* he exposes the truth of those who are startled by ghosts and spirits. When Monkey laughs and says, *\"Don’t speak nonsense—tidy up that ugliness,\"* he speaks of transforming the coarse into the wondrous.\n\nLater, the offering of tea, the inquiry into lineage and age—all foreshadow the perils of Yellow Wind Ridge, implying that only one with great skill like Sun Wukong can proceed. The hungry ghost who eats half a bowl of rice yet remains half-full illustrates the vast distance to the West, showing that only one with an unshakable resolve like Zhu Bajie can bear the burden.\n\nFor the mind is not the Dao. If one insists that the mind is the Dao and seeks it solely within the mind, one binds the mind with the mind and blocks the path—like the tiger demon of Yellow Wind Ridge, who tricked Golden Cicada and bound him to the wind-stilling stake. Why? The wind is *xun* wood, yellow is the center, and when they obstruct the heart and chest like a towering ridge, the tiger demon’s stubborn delusion is like the mind’s endless fixation.\n\nSee how the tiger demon *\"clutches his own chest, flays his skin, and stands by the roadside\"*—every detail vividly depicts the character *\"heart.\"*\n\nThus he roared: “We are none other than the vanguard of the Yellow Wind Great King’s forces!” For to cling to the mind as the Dao is to be deluded mid-journey, blocking the path ahead. *\"Pig chased the demon into the jagged rocks and drew his twin blades of red copper.\"* The \"jagged rocks\" signify the stubborn, tangled impurity; \"twin blades,\" the discordant duality; \"red,\" the mind’s true hue; \"blades,\" the mind’s unyielding endurance. Thus the tiger demon, as the mind’s obstinate grip, serves as the mountain’s path-blocking vanguard—what need for further explanation? Pig, wielding the resolve of a dead heart, becomes the trailblazer halfway up the mountain, striking first with a single crushing blow.\n\nObserve how *\"Sanzang panicked and recited the *Heart Sutra*,\"* while the demon, equally flustered, deployed the *\"golden cicada shedding its shell\"* ruse—now transforming into a tiger, now flaying its skin—all revealing how this mind, refusing to die, twists and turns, becoming its own demon. The moment true mindfulness arises, it is the very instant the wind carries him away. It is not the tiger demon using the golden cicada to seize the golden cicada, but the golden cicada itself using the golden cicada to seize the golden cicada. *\"Clasping the Tang Monk in both hands to present him to the Great King\"* and *\"binding him in the rear garden\"*—all are acts of the Tang Monk’s own doing, self-offering, self-binding, his mind ensnared in poisonous harm, beyond liberation.\n\nPig and Monkey saw through the tiger’s skin as the cicada’s discarded shell, recognizing the trap. One stood guard, the other fought, pressing straight to the demon’s cave. Monkey exerted himself and vanquished the tiger demon; Pig seized the moment and crushed it with a single strike of his rake. This is to first eliminate the mind’s obstinacy, shattering the barriers of true emptiness. Only then can one uproot the demon’s roots and rescue the golden cicada’s wholeness. Such skill is like a harmonious couple, one leading, one responding, inner and outer aiding each other in principle—what household difficulty could remain? Thus the verse concludes: *\"When the Dharma Master meets demons in distress, / Temperament in harmony subdues the chaotic fiends.\"*\n\nThis passage begins with *\"Dharma\"* and ends with *\"Dharma Master,\"* while the next chapter’s outline immediately follows with *\"Dharma Protection,\"* clearly illustrating the method of cultivating truth, its subtle foreshadowing and hidden threads like a gray snake in the grass—those with keen eyes will surely see through it.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One: Dharma Protection Establishes a Manor to Detain the Great Sage; Mount Sumeru’s Lingji Subdues the Wind Demon**\n\n*Wu Yizi says:* This continues the preceding discourse. Having extinguished the self-aggrandizing gaze of the tiger, one must still sweep away the rat’s head with its many forks. For when the mind possesses *shishen* (discerning spirit) yet clings to self-reliance, it is dazzled by brightness and loses clarity, dispatching illumination yet failing to illuminate—its harm lies in discernment that does not discern. To recognize that *shishen* is not true is to realize that the non-spiritual in spirit is true. Hence it is said: *\"To refine spirit, refine the non-spiritual spirit.\"*\n\nScholars who fail to grasp the intent of *\"non-spiritual spirit\"* may scrutinize minutiae and spawn demons, or plunge into deep doubt and multiply delusions. Some drift into heterodox paths, others waver between two possibilities—all are blind cultivation and reckless refinement, called *\"wild blindness.\"* Han Yu said: *\"One who cannot discern the grounds of gain and loss is called wild.\"* When spirit does not guard its abode, the illness lies in the heart, like a violent wind shaking without stability. Confucius said: *\"To speak without observing another’s countenance is called blindness.\"* When heart-fire attacks the liver and assaults the eyes, it is like the Yellow Wind blowing and wounding the injured.\n\nThus, long-held stagnation breeds vermin, and accumulated delusion multiplies hardships—all stem from lack of clarity, leading to endless entanglement. This is why the *Rites* warn against *\"hesitation\"* and the *Book of Documents* values *\"decisiveness.\"* To transform hesitation into decisiveness lies in nothing but clarity. Yet clarity still does not depart from *shishen*—it is the eye-opening medicine, most urgent and precise.\n\nIn this passage, the ophthalmologist serves as the great eye, while Lingji Bodhisattva is the one who, after applying the eye-opening medicine, reveals radiant illumination. Dispelling the fleeting glimpses of confusion and awakening the unobscured wondrous vision, one stabilizes the wild, erratic wind and severs the rat’s two-pronged hesitation. The rat’s nature is thievish and suspicious; it emerges from its burrow indecisively, always wavering between two ends. Thus the old demon is an ancient rat spirit from the foothills of Vulture Peak.\n\nObserve how *\"the old demon lowered his head in silence, pondering a scheme,\"* and upon hearing the words, *\"grew even more vexed, saying, ‘This fool knows nothing!’*”*\n\n“I never ate his master—yet he struck down my vanguard in turn.” Such are the words of one without steadfast vision, who instead faults others. “The old demon scrutinized carefully and saw that the Traveler’s frame was coarse and stunted, not even four feet tall”—this was belittlement born of blindness. “The Traveler said, ‘You whelp, you’ve no eye for true measure!’”—this was mockery to his face. “With a single blow to the head, he grew six feet, then stood a full ten feet tall.” For the four great elements compose a body, which inherently possesses the true form of ten feet—never to be judged by outward appearance or superficial likeness.\n\n“The Traveler revealed himself and devised a plan, but the old demon mistook the feint for substance. The two fought outside the cave, the Traveler employing the art of ‘a body beyond the body.’” Thus, with many defenses confounding the senses, the eyes grew dazzled and disordered, and so harm befell them. “The old demon unleashed his yellow wind technique—using madness to counter delusion—how could heaven and earth not darken? Thus his assault targeted the eyes.” This passage expounds that chaos cannot be quelled by further chaos; only clarity suffices to end disorder.\n\n“Hairs shrank to tiny things, like wheels spinning in frenzy.” “Fire-eyes and golden pupils could not be opened.” “Pig could not dare lift his eyes or raise his head, unaware of victory or defeat, life or death, lost in doubt and hesitation”—all depict the state of wild delusion without anchor, the moment when wondrous illumination is lost. From lack of illumination arises wild delusion; from wild delusion, the mind loses its illumination. To cure wild delusion, one must first restore illumination. Thus the Traveler said, “Saving Master can wait. I don’t know if there’s an eye-doctor around—let him treat my eyes first.”\n\n“The two paused to look and saw a farmstead, its lamplight flickering dimly.” Already, within obscurity, a sliver of light had been borrowed. “The brothers sought lodging, paid respects to the old farmer, and sat with him. The Traveler asked, ‘Does anyone here sell eye medicine?’” “The elder said, ‘That’s called the *Samādhi Divine Wind*—if it blows on you, you might still live!’” Then he added, “I once met an extraordinary man who transmitted a formula called *Three Flowers, Nine Seeds Ointment*.” This is the wondrous method of *Three Flowers Gathering at the Crown* and *Ninefold Cyclic Elixir*.\n\nPig laughed, “Sir, where’s your bright staff?” The Traveler replied, “You’re treating me like a blind man.” “Pig chuckled silently, the Traveler snickered softly”—both were veiled mockery, implying that those who blindly cultivate in ignorance have never encountered a true eye-doctor. Zhuangzi said, “Healing the eyes can forestall aging.” So it is.\n\nIn the eye-medicine passage, “the guardian” is none other than *shishen*. The entire farmstead was arranged for the eye-medicine application, a provision to retain the Great Sage—indeed, the universal eye-medicine for all beings. Is the “farmstead” (*zhuang*) here any different from Zhuangzi’s “farmstead”?\n\n“The Traveler suddenly awoke; Pig guessed idly”—do not dismiss these as mere jest. They reveal the folly of those without steadfast vision and the ignorance of vulgar eyes. The verse says, “Wondrous medicine cures eye pain; vanquish demons without hesitation.” Clear and decisive, this is the moment when illumination may be attained. Thus, in the following passage, the name of Lingji Bodhisattva appears, and the Golden Star points the way.\n\nPig said, “You secretly protected Master but could not manifest openly, so you transformed this immortal farmstead.” This shows that the eye-medicine was secretly transmitted by the old farmer—a profound truth not to be openly displayed. The Traveler said, “Let me go to the cave and scout around.” Pig replied, “Find out whether he’s dead or alive. If he’s dead… if he’s not dead…”—all indecisive, wavering words, lacking illumination.\n\n“The Traveler reached the cave entrance, but it was still barred, the demons asleep.” “He transformed into a mosquito and entered; the lesser demons snored on.” All was murky confusion, a realm of dreamlike unawareness. The old demon said, “Guard the door carefully. I fear that gust of wind didn’t kill Sun Wukong.” Such was his fearful hesitation. Then, seeing “a tightly sealed inner door, he slipped inside”—already entering its *samādhi*.\n\nHe saw “Master Tang bound to the Wind-Stilling Stake”—a state of constraint and bondage, from which there was no self-liberation. The Master “could only fix his heart on Wukong and Wuneng,” showing how the mind cannot govern itself but seeks external aid. Reciting the *Heart Sutra* alone—what use was that? A lesser demon reported, “I saw a big-eared one, but not the one from yesterday.” Such was the smallness of his perception.\n\nThe old demon said, “Sun Wukong is nowhere to be seen—he must have been blown to death by the wind, or else fled to seek reinforcements elsewhere.” Such was the delusion of his perception. The lesser demons replied, “If he’s been blown to death, it would be our good fortune. But what if he wasn’t killed—what then?” Such was the timidity of their words. All was wild conjecture and idle talk, hesitant and wavering, torn between two fears.\n\nSuddenly, the old demon confessed, “Only the Bodhisattva Lingji could still my wind’s power.” This was the hollow admission of a guilty mind, the *shen* revealing itself unbidden—a confession made without torture. As for the Star of Metal, that luminous and merciful constellation, “pointing south with his hand,” “transforming into a gentle breeze and vanishing,” with “Pig Eight Precepts bowing in gratitude”—such was the guidance of a benevolent master, akin to father and mother, for whom one vows to attain the Dao and repay the great debt.\n\nWukong ascended Mount Sumeru and peered within, seeing only “a hall adorned in brocade splendor, a chamber of solemn dignity. Golden flames and jade mist, wisdom’s sword and virtue’s assembly”—all describing Lingji’s boundless *dharma*-power, a marvel beyond words. The Wind-Stilling Pellet was perfectly round and true, the Flying Dragon Staff swift and wondrous in its divine efficacy. “Revealing his true form, he was but a yellow weasel—having stolen oil from a lamp, dimming its flame, he fled here and became a spirit.” This was the unvarnished truth of his blindness laid bare.\n\n“Seized and brought to Vulture Peak to see the Tathāgata”—precisely the exercise of great *dharma*-power, shattering the web of doubt, attaining the radiant form, and once more beholding the Tathāgata. “The two of them slaughtered a den of cunning hares, fox-spirits, musk deer, and horned stags”—what cunning, what suspicion, what deer-like panic, what branching confusion remained? This was “summoning Lingji to rescue the true monk and rediscover the great western road.”\n\nAlas!\n\nAmidst the lotus thrones and Buddha-realms, blossoms innumerable—knitting his brows, he looked intently.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: Pig Battles the Flowing-Sands River; Mokṣa Enforces the Dharma to Subdue Wujing**\n\nWu Yizi says: “The Perfected One of Purple Yang said:\n*Tiger leaps, dragon coils—wind and waves rage rough,\nAt the central true position, the Mystic Pearl is wrought.\nThough fruit on branches ripens in due season’s span,\nHow could a child in the womb bear any pearl?*\nThis is the true purport of this chapter.”\n\nThe wondrous convergence of the Five Phases lies wholly in the two earths, wù and jǐ. Earth is the center of the Five Phases, presiding over the four seasons, each for eighteen days. Dispersed, it permeates the four times to engender and transform the myriad things; united in its twofold governance, it unifies the Nine Palaces and wondrously gathers the One Origin. Thus metal and water, meeting earth, congeal and gather; wood and fire, meeting earth, harmonize and blend. Wù is yang earth, jǐ is yin earth—metal, water, wood, and fire each possess their wù-jǐ position at the Central Palace, where the Five Phases converge and revert to the Supreme Polarity. The Supreme Polarity is but a forced designation. Though earth is one of the Five Phases, it is in truth their culmination. In the human body, it is the true; the true of intent is sincerity. With sincerity, movement and stillness are both true, and nature and feelings attain the mean—hence the noble person must make his intent sincere.\n\nSha Monk is true earth. The meanings of “flowing sands,” “weak waters,” “skulls,” and “rolled-up curtain” are all revealed in the eighth chapter. This chapter particularly clarifies that metal, water, wood, and fire cannot depart from earth; obtaining this earth, they assume their proper position at the Central Palace, whereupon the functions of the golden elixir are complete and the sagely embryo is formed.\n\nThe earlier gāthā of the Bird’s-Nest Chan Master says:\n*“The wild boar shoulders his load and goes,”*\n*“The ancient stone monkey of many years,”*\n*“The water-monster met along the way.”*\n“Met” is *gòu*, signifying the wondrousness of their encounter—thus they mutually rely on the great western road. Hence it first says: *“Having crossed Yellow Wind Ridge, one enters a stretch of level ground to the west.”* Yet why should great waters suddenly block the path, so difficult to ford? Not that it is truly hard to cross—precisely in the difficulty of crossing does one encounter and thereby attain passage, which is the great western road.\n\nYellow is the true color of the center, so from Yellow Wind Ridge the essentials of the Five Phases are drawn forth. In eight lines of verse, the embodiment of all five colors and the fullness of the Nine Palaces are depicted—each word is worthy of contemplation. When Bajie battles the monster, wood meets earth and they mutually overcome. The monster’s own account reveals the wondrousness of the three and five each as a five, within which it says: *“First I gathered the infant boy and the maiden girl, then I took up the wood-mother and metal-father as my staff.”* This is the true import. The two of them fought twice, yet through impatience could not subdue him—why?\n\nWhen hearts and minds remain unaligned, there is need for patient mediation—this cannot be forced through coercion or haste. Thus when Wukong seeks stillness through impatience, his impatience only grows; when the water monster retreats to provoke action, his movement only makes stillness harder to attain. Hence Bajie’s plea for “ten thousand strategies,” and the Monkey King’s counsel to the master: *“Do not fret,”* followed by *“go beg alms and rest,”* showing that progress in cultivation should be gradual, not rushed. The remark on *“how hard it is to carry clouds”* reveals that ordinary beings can advance step by step but not all at once. The admonition that *“no methods should be applied, only thorough experience in foreign lands”* shows that dull natures value effort over ease. The observation that *“though they could protect, they could not go ahead to fetch the scriptures”* demonstrates that spiritual practice proceeds from difficulty, not ease.\n\nWhen Bajie enters the water to challenge the monster, the origin of the treasure staff is recounted—phrases like *“length lies in the mind, thickness follows intent”* clearly reveal the operation of true intention and the mind’s radiant wisdom. *“This bout fought underwater then surfaced”* echoes the *Cantong Qi*’s *“where speech fails, they are no kin.”* The verse has already made this plain. For yin and yang to unite, true earth must mediate—just as a matchmaker is needed for a marriage. Where speech fails, hearts remain estranged, and harmony eludes. The line *“only because the wood-mother overcomes the elixir knife”* explicitly identifies Wuneng as wood and Wujing as earth.\n\n*“The monster only clamors by the riverbank, refusing to come ashore”* depicts a nature still in flux, poised between two possibilities—most elusive to grasp. Once impatience takes hold, the creature vanishes without a trace, leaving no opening for action. Thus when Wukong’s temper flares and he leaps into a somersault, the monster conceals himself completely, nowhere to be seen. Only by turning inward in quiet reflection and summoning Guanyin Bodhisattva can the original face be revealed. Wukong then hastens to the Southern Sea to pay homage. The Bodhisattva says: *“You ape, ever relying on your own strength, unwilling to speak of protecting the Tang monk. Had you mentioned ‘the scripture-seeker,’ he would have submitted at once.”* For the protection of the scripture-seeker is the shared purpose of the three. To speak of *“the scripture-seeker”* is to establish common speech, align hearts, and dissolve suspicion through mutual sincerity.\n\nThe Bodhisattva calls Huian to fetch the red gourd, bids Wujing take refuge, and arranges the nine skulls in the pattern of the Nine Palaces, placing the gourd at the center—forming a dharma-boat. Excellent indeed! The Great Being’s compassionate vessel ferries the world, revealing the system of the golden elixir.\n\nOne who can harness and steer it finds their drifting nature settled, the tranquil waves passable, and thus avoids sinking to instead reach the far shore—all fundamentally rooted in this. The *\"gourd\"* symbolizes the two earths forming the jade tablet. *\"At the center\"* they wondrously merge and congeal. The *\"arrangement of the Nine Palaces\"* is all for my use; here, one establishes life and destiny—what peril or obstruction could remain?\n\nA poem says:\n*The Five Agents pair to match celestial truth,\nRecognizing the old master from of old.\nRefining the self and establishing the foundation—subtle use,\nDiscerning right and wrong to see the cause.\nMetal returns to nature, reuniting with its kind,\nWood departs to seek affinity, yet remains of equal rank.\nThe two tablets complete the work in stillness,\nHarmonizing water and fire without a trace of dust.*\n\nFor yin and yang must pair to match celestial truth. The old master was lost, but now may be recognized—this is the subtle use of establishing the foundation, the cause of dispelling the deviant and preserving the upright. Metal departs yet returns, restoring its original nature; self and other were ever of the same kind, metal and wood not of different ranks. Thus, the two tablets complete the work, forming the sacred embryo. From this stillness, nurturing and harmonizing, what trace of water or fire’s dust remains?\n\nThis single dharma-boat of the Great Being is like the dragon maiden’s single pearl—it is the original essence of human life. Thus, the Curtain-Lifting General is the true earth of true yin and true yang, the Yellow Dame of marital union, the essential subtlety of forming the embryo and establishing the foundation.\n\nMujaku then calls forth Wujing, who sincerely submits. The skulls are removed, the Nine Palaces arranged, the gourd placed at the center, and the master invited to sit upon it. Lightly and steadily they cross, waves calm and winds still; in no time, they reach the far shore. Truly, this is the great function of establishing life and destiny, of planting the feet firmly on solid ground.\n\nYet why is it also called *\"pure and non-action\"*? For though there is action, it does not adhere—like the Bodhisattva sending Mujaku to demonstrate the dharma without going herself. The operation lies with Wukong and Wuneng, the boat is formed by Wujing, while the Tang monk enjoys non-action. Though there is action, it is in truth non-action.\n\nWhen Mujaku retrieves the gourd, it transforms into yin qi, the two earths become true, and the Nine Palaces merge completely. From this, the foundation is set, the golden elixir takes form, and the Way of non-action gradually manifests.\n\nAh! The method of the golden elixir’s function is clearly revealed here!\n\nIn Chapter Twenty-Three: \"The Tang Monk Remembers His Origin; The Four Sages Test Meditative Resolve\"\n\nWu Yizi says:\nThe Five Phases converge and cluster, forming the sacred embryo.\nThe original root is already attained, and life and destiny have their foundation.\nFrom this point, one preserves and nurtures it, gradually shedding the embryo to approach spiritual transformation—thus may celestial immortality be realized.\n\nYet I fear that worldly people may misconstrue the wondrous Dao of convergence and clustering as the heterodox teaching of \"absorbing yin to supplement yang,\" becoming infatuated at the sight of beauty, sinking into the sea of desire, forgetting their origin and drowning in mere words—how truly pitiable! Therefore, this passage urgently highlights how easily one may be deluded by feminine allure, and how crucial it is to maintain steadfast vigilance, never forgetting one’s original face.\n\nThus it is said: \"This chapter of the tale reveals that the Way of seeking the scriptures does not depart from the Way of attending to the root within one’s own body.\" Ah! The immortal master’s words are most subtle—\"attending to the root\" runs through the entire work. Should one glance superficially, the profound principle would be buried and lost.\n\nThis \"root\" does not refer to what lies near or within, but rather to that which, in the opening chapter, precedes heaven and earth as the primordial spiritual root, and which, after the Five Villas’ episode, permeates the later heaven and earth, yet remains the primordial spiritual root. Every person possesses it in full, lacking nothing. Those who have lost it must attend to it to return; returning is but the restoration of what was originally present within. Those who have not lost it must attend to it to avoid forgetting; forgetting means forgetting what was never originally present within. Those who have lost and then regained it must attend to it to preserve it; preservation means securing what was originally present within, letting go of what was not, and fortunately returning to what was.\n\nHence it is said: \"The Way of seeking the scriptures does not depart from the Way within one’s own body.\" In the verse, \"the wayward monkey firmly bound\" and \"the inferior horse diligently reined\" are acts of discipline upon the ground of inherent nature; \"Wood Mother and Metal Duke\" and \"Yellow Dame with Crimson Child\" are functions upon the root of life. Once the true message is recognized, this is the great wisdom. With a heavy burden and a long road ahead, all depends on diligent effort.\n\nShould the slightest thought of slackness arise, it is a sign of failing to bear the burden fully—idleness and desire will then gradually sprout. If there is any impulse toward hasty progress, it is a sign of reckless haste and overstepping, inevitably leading to unruliness that cannot be reined in. Pigsy, resenting the weight of his load and urging the horse to speed, thus sows the seeds of trouble. This is like the Monkey King wielding his staff to tame the wayward ape, or spurring the inferior horse to gallop—both acts of discipline.\n\nThe episode \"Testing the Chan Mind\" is overt in its meaning, yet its subtlety lies beyond the words. For while testing the mind is the manifest intent, the alchemical method is still concealed within. Why? To test the mind is merely to test it—one or two beauties would suffice to captivate the soul; why wait for four? Yet the Dao is called the interplay of one yin and one yang. The master and his three disciples naturally form a fourfold harmony, the true number of yin and yang in balance, where none can be lacking. Only when one sees beauty as no beauty and faces temptation without attachment does one attain the unyielding, indestructible body. Scholars may find it easy to sever ties with the world and renounce all things, but when the body itself is subjected to restraint and confronted with temptation, the mind often shifts and resolve is lost.\n\nTo achieve true mastery, one must pass through the crucible of tribulation; to recognize pure gold in its full luster, it must be forged in searing flames. The trial by the Four Saints is like testing gold with a touchstone: when gold meets the touchstone, its true grade is revealed; when one encounters the trial of the Four Saints, the sacred and the profane are fully exposed. Nothing in the world stirs the heart more easily than beauty; if one remains unmoved by it, nothing can move the heart at all. This is why the transformed maiden tests them—like refining with fire, only true gold remains unaltered.\n\nIn the alchemical method, the female seeks the male, as in a marriage where the groom is brought into the bride’s home. This is no ordinary union, so the Four Saints take the form of women awaiting childbirth to summon a husband, with Pigsy as the groom and Friar Sand as the matchmaker. Yet the Four Saints are nothing other than the true qi of the One. From the One they become four, and from these four arise countless transformations—just as the Great Sage’s true gold can manifest boundless change. Only the Great Sage perceives this and recognizes the subtle work of enlightenment. The hidden meaning of the text is thus made clear.\n\nThe woman said, “I was born in the year *dinghai*, on the third day of the third month, at the *you* hour. Thus my husband is three years older than I.” “Three years older” means he belongs to the *shen* year. *Shen* is the Monkey—nothing other than the true *qi* of the One. This estate was left by one born in the Year of the Monkey, so are his wife and daughter not transformations of those not born in the Year of the Monkey? The mother and three daughters together total ninety-nine years in age, the extreme of yang numbers—this is the principle of old yang transforming into yin and producing the daughters.\n\nThe *Baihutong* states: “Fire is so called because it transforms.” Thus we know metal can transform into fire, and fire in turn can transform into metal. Here, the four women become the raging fire of four crucibles, and whatever encounters them is inevitably melted and refined. At first, one relies on this fire to congeal the elixir, and in the end, one relies on it to refine the elixir. This transformation is the most essential fire-work in the alchemy of the golden elixir, sufficient to forge and temper one into truth.\n\nHow do we know this is fire? The woman said, “I was born in the year *dinghai*.” Is not *ding* fire? Is not *hai* the wood that generates fire? And are they not in a pine and cypress grove, where the art thrives and fire blazes? If so, then her boasts of vast fields, livestock, silks, and embroideries are all the radiance of fire; her praises of Zhenzhen, Aiai, and Lianlian’s beauty are all the spirit of fire; her descriptions of the enjoyments of spring, summer, autumn, and winter are all the movement of fire. Her “sudden rage, turning to enter the screen, and bolting the waist-door” is the rising and falling of fire. Her disregard for Pigsy’s ugliness and eagerness to take him as a son-in-law, so long as he can manage the household, is fire’s indiscriminate melting of jade and stone alike.\n\nHer “suddenly opening the door with a shout, raising a red lantern and a censer, fragrant clouds swirling, the clatter of jade pendants, leading the women in worship” is the fierce, swirling, searing, and refining power of fire. Her “leaving behind a pair of gauze lanterns, leading the fool step by step, the hall aglow with silver candles” is fire’s flickering brilliance, its thoroughness and precision, leaving no place to hide. Her words to the three daughters, giving them handkerchiefs to cover their heads and failing to find a match, are the unpredictable, lively, and elusive nature of fire. Her returning to the room, handing over a pearl-embroidered robe, and binding the fool are fire’s twisting restraint, its intricate and inescapable grasp.\n\n“Those people vanished in an instant, leaving behind a grand hall with carved beams and painted rafters” is fire’s transformative concealment, its marvelous and swift changes, which cannot be grasped by form. When Pigsy “twisted left and right, unable to endure, repeatedly saying ‘let’s discuss this later’; letting go of the reins, calling his mother to arrange the marriage, boasting of his skills, declaring ‘no need to negotiate,’ his lust in disarray, insisting on bowing to them all, ‘all must cover their heads for me,’ and when he failed to catch them, you beckoned me; when he put on the pearl robe and fell to the ground”—all this is the state of being refined by fire, flying and leaping uncontrollably, bound and restrained, losing one’s original nature.\n\nThe most crucial point in this passage is Pigsy’s words, “In my youth, I once learned the method of *aozhan*.” Those who recklessly practice *caizhan* take female beauty as their crucible, believing the perverse doctrine of “absorbing yin to supplement yang,” thereby burning themselves to death—like moths flying into flame. How lamentable! Thus the poem concludes with its true meaning: *“The foolish do not know the root cause, / The sword of desire wounds the body in secret.”* This is the harm of seeking scriptures outside the body while neglecting the root.\n\nThe verse within states: *“From this, wash the heart and reform the faults.”* This is the essential point: after congealing the elixir, one must thoroughly wash the heart and guard against desire. Without guarding against desire, the original root, once obtained, will be lost again—how pitiful! If one can henceforth not forget the original root, only then is one truly virtuous. Thus it is also said: *“From the correct path, cultivate with care, / Sweep away love and desire to return to truth.”*\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four: The Immortal of Longevity Hill Keeps an Old Friend / The Handsome Monkey King Steals the Ginseng Fruit at Wuzhuang Temple**\n\n*Wu Yizi* says: These five or six chapters together elucidate that consuming the golden elixir is the original root of the body. Within the chapter, the “ginseng fruit of Wuzhuang Temple” expounds the principle of the golden elixir. The “Pure Wind and Bright Moon” striking the fruit and the “elixir plate” receiving it reveal the name of the golden elixir. Its meaning is drawn from the *Doctrine of the Mean*: “Establishing the great root of the world, one can assist heaven and earth in their positions and nurture the myriad things,” transforming the intent of “stiff flesh” into a wondrous awakening, deeply sufficient to break through deafness and enlighten the vulgar. If readers remain ignorant and dismiss it as absurd and unorthodox, they are like the mice in the pine and cypress, unaware of the fine cedar within the hall.\n\n*Can* means “three.” The *Book of Changes* says: “Three for heaven, two for earth, and thus the numbers are established.” One, three, and five are the numbers of heaven; two and four are the numbers of earth. Three threes make nine, the number of old yang; three twos make six, the number of old yin. Two threes and one two make eight, the number of young yin; two twos and one three make seven, the number of young yang. All are “three for heaven, two for earth.” Three multiplied by two is five, which ultimately returns to one. One paired becomes three; three and five transform into three. Three threes are three; five fives are five. Extending this to a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, or a hundred million, and even to the infinite, there is nothing that is not “three and two,” nothing that is not one.\n\nThus the Dao of Heaven is without beginning or end, and through the reckoning of numbers one may infer its mechanism. The Dao of Heaven is most wondrous, and by means of numbers one may illuminate the true principle. Principle is made manifest through numbers, and numbers emerge from principle; they may rely upon each other but may not be violated—hence it is called “relying on numbers.”\n\nWhat is the One? It is the primordial *qi* of True Unity. Master Zhu said: “Heaven, through yin and yang and the Five Phases, transforms and gives birth to the myriad things. *Qi* forms their shapes, and principle is also bestowed upon them. This principle does not depart from *qi*, nor does *qi* depart from principle.”\n\nThe Way of the Golden Elixir takes the cultivation of *qi* as its foundation. The essence of cultivating *qi* lies in accumulating righteousness. If one cannot accumulate righteousness but instead feels shame when looking up and remorse when looking down, then principle is lost and *qi* is obstructed—how can it then fill Heaven and Earth with its vastness? Thus the Way of the Immortals, when it reaches Mencius’ teaching on “cultivating *qi*,” is nearly fully revealed. And when it is said that this *qi* is born of “accumulating righteousness,” the methods of the Elixir are almost complete. Those who cling to emptiness and stillness without understanding the accumulation of righteousness and cultivation of *qi*—the work of the heart—will ultimately perish.\n\nHuman life is like a fleeting glimpse of a horse or a dream of a butterfly; Heaven’s mandate is without constancy. One must swiftly turn the light inward, sever desires, and follow principle, embracing impartial vastness. When principle is attained, one’s nature is restored; when nature is restored, life is consolidated. With the vastness of the eye attained, this is called accumulating righteousness and cultivating *qi*; this is called establishing oneself and securing one’s destiny. Its most crucial point lies in vigilance in solitude.\n\nIn a single thought of numinous clarity, preserve the genuine and eliminate the false, never departing from it for even a moment. What Heaven has bestowed upon me is only this; and what I use to practice virtue and attain the Dao is only this. Relying solely on this as the master, one is not swayed by emotions nor bound by names and conventions. Gain and loss, constant change—none of these are heeded. This is what it means to be steadfast.\n\nVigilance renders the heart’s ground empty and vast—this is the state before arousal, the establishment of the great root of the world, the original face of human life. Unfallen into being or non-being, unconfined by place, without sound or scent, it is the undifferentiated Great Ultimate. Confucius’ joy was in this; Yan Hui’s unchanging joy was in this. Li Yanping’s silent sitting and embodied realization were realizations of this; Lu Xiangshan’s “first establishing the great” was first establishing this. Chen Baisha’s emergence of signs in stillness—this was the very sign.\n\nThose who have not yet recognized this must still it to perceive it; those who have recognized it must still it to nurture it. When stillness reaches its extreme and movement arises, one must move to embody this; when engaging with affairs and encountering things, one must face circumstances to verify this. This is what is meant by observing the mechanism of movement and stillness, being and non-being, and preserving the all-encompassing, unfathomable spirit.\n\nOnce the great root is established, the thousand branches and ten thousand leaves all flourish and grow unimpeded. Thus one can establish the heart for Heaven and Earth, secure the destiny of the people, and assist Heaven and Earth in nurturing the myriad things.\n\nYet even when one has fully attained this spirit—luminous and numinous, capable of responding to myriad changes, foreseeing past and future, equalizing life and death, transcending the mundane and entering sagehood—one may consider it the ultimate and complete, true and without further addition. But how is this spirit merely the yin spirit of the postnatal, not the yang spirit of the prenatal? When the Four Great Elements disperse, it remains solitary and is still bound by the regulations of Heaven and Earth, unable to regulate them. Heaven and Earth must settle this spirit in the place of utmost yang before it can fully attain its original root. The original root lies where I was born, inseparable from the primordial *qi* of True Unity.\n\nThough principle is not mixed with *qi*, it is never apart from *qi*. Thus where *qi* transforms, there too is the abode of spirit and principle. *Qi* has no luminous, numinous spirit, but possesses a spirit of profound obscurity. The spirit that is not spirit is the ultimate spirit; the spirit of the ultimate spirit is the ultimate truth. When people speak of this spirit, they are utterly at a loss. Even those who claim to recognize it do not know where to begin, and some dismiss it entirely with the phrase “seeking the obscure and practicing the strange!”\n\nConsider this: the *River Chart*, the *Luo Writing*, and the *Great Change* are the ancestral methods of the ancient divine sages, transmitted in the hearts of the Zhou and Confucius to enlighten later generations. What they expound—yin and yang in their proper and reversed sequences, the principles of the prenatal and postnatal—are these truly “seeking the obscure and practicing the strange”?\n\nI do not say that fully attaining this luminous, numinous, and unwavering spirit is not the true Way, but rather that only when one reaches the utmost can one fully attain the luminous, numinous, and unwavering as the ultimate truth. Thus it is said: “If you wish for the Valley Spirit never to die, you must establish the root in the Mysterious Female.”\n\nLet me clarify the meaning of this passage: At the beginning of the chapter, the Eight Precepts were bound by selfish desires, having lost their original root. The Traveler’s words in the *Xun* trigram faintly illuminated a hundred aspects, reminding and arousing their sense of shame and innate goodness. The *West River Moon* verse states: “There is only one original root, with no trifling profit to add to the bag. Safeguard this capital well, firmly guard it and do not let it dissipate.” This speaks of preserving what has not been lost, returning what has been lost, and, having lost and then returned, being vigilant—there is only one, with no possibility of addition.\n\nFrom this, one knows that the depravity of those who practice sexual arts is like the Eight Precepts fainting in confusion, senseless. The Eight Precepts, ashamed, said: “From now on, I will never dare to act recklessly.” This is the moment of a scholar’s repentance and entry into the Way. Thus the author, in concluding the harm of lust, subtly reveals the root—this is the One.\n\nThe number One is contained within Five and reaches its utmost in the myriad. The outline speaks of “Mount Everlife,” and the inexhaustible myriad myriad is already encompassed within the myriad; it speaks of the “Abbey of Five Estates,” and the boundless permutations of five are already unified within Five.\n\nThe Five comprise three of Heaven and two of Earth, yet none depart from metal, wood, water, fire, and soil. Paired with the Five Teachings, they become benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust; united in the One Origin, they form the Primal Chaos and the Supreme Ultimate. The text explicitly states: “When the Primal Chaos first divided and the Vast Mist began to separate, at the moment before Heaven and Earth unfolded, this Spiritual Root was produced.” This Spiritual Root is the same as the Spiritual Root in the opening chapter, yet it distinguishes between the prior-to-Heaven and the posterior-to-Heaven: the former, existing before Heaven and Earth, is the Spiritual Root that gives rise to Heaven and Earth—what is meant by “There is something prior to Heaven and Earth,” which is the prior-to-Heaven that Heaven does not transgress; the latter, arising after Heaven and Earth, is the Spiritual Root produced by Heaven and Earth—what is meant by “Within it lies a treasure, hidden in the mountain of form,” which is the posterior-to-Heaven that Heaven does not transgress. It emerges from the prior-to-Heaven and enters the posterior-to-Heaven. The Spiritual Roots of prior and posterior to Heaven are ultimately one qi, ultimately the Great Root, ultimately the progenitor of the Five Phases. Those who study the Dao, if they can obtain this prior-to-Heaven qi within the posterior-to-Heaven, can thereby master this qi to govern the myriad principles of the posterior-to-Heaven, without falling into isolation.\n\nThe outline speaks of the “Great Immortal”—between Heaven and Earth, only this Root is great; of the “Pilgrim”—between Heaven and Earth, only this is the movement of the Five Phases; of “retaining old friends”—retaining the old refers to traces already manifest; of “stealing the ginseng”—stealing the ginseng praises the power of Heaven and Earth. The text’s declaration to “offer incense and worship solely to the words ‘Heaven and Earth’” makes the fundamental intent clear. The boy says, “These two words—the one below cannot receive our incense,” meaning it belongs to yin and is insufficient to match the marvel of Heaven. The elder, having beheld the fine scenery of Mount Everlife, finds its secluded charm extraordinary and believes the Thunderclap Monastery is not far, but the Pilgrim laughs: “Too soon! Too soon!”\n\nHere the Tang Priest has reached this stage—though he recognizes the original Root, he cannot examine it with true insight. To advance further, the original Root remains the original Root, yet still eludes his grasp. Only through reverent seeking, wholehearted devotion, and unwavering aspiration can it be fully preserved without loss. As the saying goes, “Recognizing the original Root is but the beginning of true work”—mere empty awakening does not bring one to Vulture Peak. Thus the Pilgrim speaks of such difficulty, urging him to sudden awakening: “If only your mind is sincere in seeing your nature, every moment of turning back is Vulture Peak itself.” This echoes the *Zhou Odes*: “Learning ever shines brighter toward radiance,” warning against needless doubts of distance or separation, lest the original Root be grasped and then lost again.\n\nOnly the Five-Zhuang Temple of Western Ox-Head Continent yields this “Herb of Returned Elixir,” also called “Ginseng Fruit.” The West is the direction of Lesser Yin, corresponding to autumn, the season when the myriad things bear fruit. Fruit embodies yang within yin—postnatal qi harboring the prenatal One. That ginseng grows between Heaven and Earth to become fruit follows the same principle. The character *草* (herb) is composed of *甘* (sweet), *日* (sun), and *十* (ten): two figures paired, encompassing the numbers of Heaven (one), Earth (ten), and the four directions with the center. Within lies the utmost yang, combining to form its image—hence *草* (herb), which also means “early,” urging swift return of the elixir. This is the true gold of the Golden Elixir, the rightful heir of returning to the origin—thus the name “Zhen Yuanzi” (Master of the Origin). If one can consume it, partaking of Heaven and Earth to become all things, how is this not to reign as lord of the world?\n\n“It bears fruit once every three thousand years; to smell one grants three hundred and sixty years of life; to eat one, forty-seven thousand.” Among his scattered immortals, countless in number, forty-eight remain in sight. He takes forty-six to Heaven, leaving two to guard the temple: one aged one thousand three hundred and twenty, the other one thousand two hundred. Though the numbers of Three Heavens and Two Earths are interwoven to depict its marvel, this is no empty talk but solid truth—all ultimately deriving from the One and Five, extending to the myriad things.\n\nMaster Zhen Yuan instructs Pure Wind and Bright Moon to pluck ginseng fruit in welcome of old friends. The two lads, citing Confucius’ words, doubt they share the same path, revealing their deep understanding of how worldly scholars cling to Confucianism and doubt the Dao. The Great Immortal, recalling the Buddha’s assembly, clarifies their bond as old friends, pointing to the shared origin of Dao and Confucianism. When master and disciples arrive at the temple, they admire the scenery, read the couplets within, and inquire of Pure Wind and Bright Moon—yet these are not the “Heaven and Earth” incense offerings, for they speak of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy inviting one to taste the Dao Fruit of Chaos. All describe the reality of Two Earths and Three Heavens, the profound mystery of the prenatal True One, though people fail to recognize it.\n\nThe Pilgrim’s mischief is no mere temper—it exposes how worldly folk all claim sagely wisdom and heroic might. Even one as spiritually awakened as the Pilgrim struggles to yield and believe; how rare, then, are true kindred spirits! The Tang Priest, unaware of this rare treasure, trembles and retreats three feet—not from ignorance, but to show how worldly eyes, even in one with deep karmic roots like the Tang Priest, find it hard to receive such guidance. How many, then, abandon themselves to fate!\n\nPig, drooling with greed, schemes to taste the new; the Pilgrim turns invisible, climbs the tree, and steals the fruit. When one falls and vanishes, they summon the local earth god to investigate. This reveals how all covet the Golden Elixir, yet without true knowledge, none dare consume it hastily. The Pilgrim calls himself “the most notorious thief under Heaven”—no idle boast, for this path steals from Heaven and Earth, seizing the workings of creation, truly the ringleader of the treasury of principle.\n\nThe earth god says: “This fruit fears the Five Phases: it withers at wood, dissolves in water, burns in fire, and sinks into earth. Only when struck by metal does it fall; only when wrapped in silk can it be held.” For the Golden Elixir is the primordial qi of chaos, not leaning toward any single phase. To favor one is to fail in bearing true fruit—no margin for error, as the saying goes: “A hair’s breadth of deviation and the elixir will not form.”\n\nThe Great Sage steals three; the three share them, united in purpose. Pig, insatiable in greed, clamors and ruins the plan, unable to guard against danger. The two lads revile the Tang Priest, who says: “Virtue and righteousness matter most; have them apologize.” Yet the three disciples deny all—proof that the Tang Priest cannot partake of the Golden Elixir, foreshadowing the later uprooting of the tree. The Golden Elixir harmonizes the Five Phases and embodies the Five Virtues: the Tang Priest’s hesitation is lack of wisdom; the disciples’ denial, lack of faith. Without wisdom and faith, two of the Five Virtues are missing, three of the Five Phases unbalanced. With the root shaken, the fruit vanishes—is this not the inevitable workings of principle and fate?\n\nNote: To the west of Persia lies a kingdom called Dashi. Its king often sends men by ship with provisions into the sea. After eight years, they still have not reached the western shore. In the sea, they see a square stone, upon which grows a tree with red branches and green leaves. On the tree, countless infants, six or seven inches long, neither speak nor cry but all can smile, moving their hands and feet, their heads fixed to the branches. When plucked, they wither and blacken in hand. The envoy brings back one branch, now kept by the king of Dashi. From this, we see such trees truly exist in the world—far from absurd. The immortal master merely borrows this to expound the Dao of the Golden Elixir, partaking of the creative workings of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThose of limited knowledge like Jia Dao and Meng Jiao, unaware even of the infant tree, how could they ever grasp the wonders of the Golden Elixir!\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: The Immortal Zhenyuan Gives Chase to Seize the Pilgrim Monks; Sun Wukong Raises Havoc at Wuzhuang Temple**\n\nWu Yizi observes: The earlier verse states, *\"There is but one original root—no trifling profit to swell the purse.\"* Yet Zhu Bajie, in his greed, seeks to add where nothing is to be gained; Tang Sanzang, in his ignorance, resists and obstructs. Whether excessive or deficient, both fail to savor the true flavor—for the flavor lies in the original.\n\nThe root is first uprooted; whence then does the Dao arise? If one does not thoroughly investigate and firmly cultivate this fundamental root, it is to abandon the source for the branches, to remain ignorant of the hidden mechanism within one’s sleeve. One may attempt to steal across Chen Cang in darkness, yet know not that one’s footing is weak. No matter how cunning the schemes, no matter how extreme the transformations, all remain but illusory passions and false appearances—shifting and erring, turning back and forth, with no means of deliverance. Would this not delay the journey, preventing one from ever reaching the Western Heaven and beholding the Buddha’s face? As the saying goes: *\"The halo behind the neck is still illusion; clouds beneath the feet do not make one an immortal.\"*\n\nThis is like the Great Sage toppling the tree’s fruit, whereupon the two youths bolt the layered gates, declaring: *\"You’ve ruined the immortal root of our Wuzhuang Temple! If you wish to reach the Western Heaven and pay homage to the Buddha, you’ll have to turn back, re-enter the wheel of rebirth, and be born again!\"* Stern in word and just in principle, their admonition is as thunderous as a hibernating dragon’s roar, as nurturing as a compassionate sail in the rain.\n\nYet Wukong laughs, revealing the truth; the two youths curse, branding him a thief; Bajie clamors to strike, taking sides—all mistaking the false for the true. How could they not forsake the real for the illusory? By uprooting the divine tree and severing the elixir’s lineage, their cry of *\"Let’s all scatter!\"* is as apt as *\"When the tree falls, the monkeys disperse\"*—precise and unerring. The verse *\"Wukong has ruined the Herb of Returning Life; the bright moon and clear wind chill the heart and gall\"* serves as the sharpest awakening.\n\nFor one must first act, then gradually attain effortless mastery. If one merely awakens to the emptiness within *\"emptiness\"* but fails to recognize the *\"fruit of emptiness\"* within that emptiness, what result can a single awakening yield? Is this not to lose the Returning Elixir in the very act of awakening? Though the clear wind and bright moon remain, how can they be enjoyed? In the end, one will still fall into the dust, unable to accomplish anything.\n\nLocking the gates and lying are but mixed tactics—where then is the method to revive the dead? Adding greens and serving tea are but misapplied, rigid views; shutting the doors and hurling abuse only create a scene of verbal strife. Unlocking the gates to flee by night is but groping in the dark—though one may temporarily escape the cage, one cannot evade the net. Rushing forth while others sleep is but stumbling and falling—though one may strive forward, one will ultimately lag behind.\n\nThus, Immortal Zhenyuan awakens the two drowsy youths to investigate the root of the harm, and pursues them for nine hundred *li* to seize back the reckless ones who have obscured their origin. His mastery of the universe within his sleeve is like the strings that manipulate puppets—what is meant by *\"The Heavenly Gate in hand, the Earth’s Axis born in the heart.\"*\n\n*\"Each tied to a single pillar\"* shows that every person is inseparable from their fundamental root—how can one stand without relying on it? The hasty use of the Seven-Star Whip made from dragon skin to strike them reveals that each must be interrogated to uncover their origin—how can one not reflect deeply and gain insight! *\"Striking the legs\"* strikes at their unsteady footing—how can they wander recklessly? *\"Substituting the blows\"* substitutes repeated inquiry so that they may hasten forward.\n\nIf one relies on cleverness and deploys petty wit, seeking to use the fragile willow’s form for the plan of rebirth and transformation, this is to take the false as real—even the real becomes false. Like stealing away at midnight, it is nothing but a dream. When master and disciples transform the willow tree into an illusory body while obscuring the truth that the human and tree are the real body, how can the elder not nod off in the saddle, his foundation unsteady?\n\nOnce reproached, their guilt collapses; the Great Immortal catches up and seizes them again, binding them as before. He wraps the three in cloth, then lacquers them—those who obscure their origin do so because they cannot turn inward to illuminate themselves. The many-eyed cloth is wrapped tightly around them so that their entire bodies may grow eyes to seek clarity; the outer lacquering ensures that, though the exterior is dark, the interior may shine with self-awareness. If one cannot turn inward to awaken to the root, one is not far from death—even if revived from such a tight encasement and lacquered for burial, it is still a stroke of fortune. Who would say it is inappropriate?\n\nWhy is Wukong alone ordered into the oil cauldron? Oil is water; the cauldron is metal. Beneath it burns wood and fire; within it lies stone and earth. Though the five phases gather in their forms, they remain easily stained by grease and fat. Moreover, they are divided and disharmonious, unable to unite as one. If scholars do not fathom the deep source within but merely follow the external traces, their desiccation will come swiftly.\n\nToppling the immortal root serves to chastise the confusion of truth and falsehood; mistaking the false for the true serves to test one’s exhaustion. Uprooting the tree and overturning the hearth follow the same principle—both are but a great uproar. When the tree falls, the monkeys scatter; when the cauldron leaks, the oil dries—how can one not regret the tumult?\n\nAlas! The difficulty of descending into the oil cauldron is like the difficulty of ascending to the Western Heaven! Only by enduring the oil cauldron can one ascend to the Western Heaven. Wukong may be able to descend but cannot; he may be able to ascend but cannot. If he cannot protect Tang Sanzang, neither descending nor ascending, neither ascending nor descending—what is to be done? To protect Tang Sanzang, descend into the cauldron, and ascend to Heaven, one must still turn inward, reflect, and invite Guanyin Bodhisattva.\n\nChapter Twenty-Six: Sun Wukong Seeks the Formula on Three Isles; Guanyin Bodhisattva Revives the Tree with Sweet Springs\n\nWu Yizi states: This precisely speaks of ingesting the golden elixir as the fundamental principle of cultivating the body.\n\nFormerly, the Fifth Patriarch, Great Master Hongren, transmitted a verse to the Sixth Patriarch, Huineng:\n\n*\"When the sentient come to sow the seed,\nBy the ground the fruit will grow.\nThe insentient, lacking seed,\nLack nature and thus no birth.\"*\n\nHaving received it, Huineng added: *\"The robe covers only your body—do not transmit it further.\"* When Huiming pursued him to inquire about the Dharma, the Sixth Patriarch said: *\"Do not think of good, do not think of evil. At just this moment, return to me Venerable Ming’s original face.\"* Ming greatly awakened and asked: *\"Beyond these secret words, is there yet meaning?\"* The Sixth Patriarch replied: *\"What I now tell you is not secret; if you turn inward in reflection, the secret remains with you.\"* The Sixth Patriarch then instructed him to go north to receive others.\n\nLater, the Sixth Patriarch arrived at Caoxi, where he was pursued by wicked youths. Concealing his traces among the Huai and Ji districts, he at last accomplished the great matter.\n\nHow can fruit arise without seed? How can nature take form without sentiment? That nature cannot exist apart from sentiment is like fruit that cannot grow apart from the earth. When the Sixth Patriarch spoke of not thinking of good or evil, he had already returned the original face—yet he still said, *\"Not secret; you must turn inward in reflection.\"* Instructing him to go north to receive others—whom was he to receive? This may be clearly understood.\n\nOtherwise, like passing through the Wuzhuang Temple only to miss the ginseng fruit before one’s very eyes—is this not to be without sentiment and seed, and how then can there be nature and life? The Venerable Xue Daoguang, with his wondrous awakening beyond the dust, keen wisdom, and perfect comprehension, ultimately turned inward in reflection, yet deemed it not the supreme vehicle. Seeking out a true person and receiving guidance, he was drenched in sweat and suddenly repented his past errors. Thereupon, he cast off his monastic robes, returned to lay life, and concealed himself in a bustling metropolis, relying on the powerful to resolve his great matter before attaining the true fruit. This was Daoguang’s turning inward to seek the method, humbling himself to gain benefit.\n\nThus it may be known that mere awakening is not the true seed, and without sentiment, nature cannot be fulfilled. Mencius said, *\"Whether one dies young or lives long, one does not waver; one cultivates the self and awaits destiny—this is how to establish one’s mandate.\"* Master Jing said, *\"Though one stands unmoving at the hundred-foot pole’s tip, to have entered thus is not yet true. Take one more step at the hundred-foot pole’s tip, and the ten directions are your entire body.\"* The *Awakening to Reality* states, *\"Only when medicine meets its kindred qi does it take form; the Dao resides in the subtle and imperceptible, harmonizing with nature. Once the golden elixir is swallowed into the belly, one knows at last that my destiny is not ruled by Heaven.\"* All speak of exhausting one’s nature to reach destiny, obtaining the primordial utmost essence as the supreme vehicle of the Great Dao.\n\nThose who study the Dao in cultivating the self and dwelling in the world must not rely on self-strength; they must empty their minds, humble themselves before others, guard against deceit, and seek instruction—only after diminishing again and again can they gain true benefit.\n\nSun Wukong, with his divine transformations and extraordinary prowess, protected the Tang Monk, believing himself invincible in his strength—yet how much more invincible was the protection afforded by the ginseng fruit! How could Wukong escape the grasp of Zhenyuan? Why? Because empty awakening is not as real as the fruit.\n\nThe eight opening lines precisely diagnose the root malady, and the concluding line—*\"For those stubborn in their rigidity, there are always others more rigid still\"*—reveals that those mired in self-adherence remain utterly deluded. When the Immortal Zhenyuan took the pilgrim’s hand, it was the mechanism to guide the Tang Monk; when he demanded the tree be restored, it was to urge the cultivation of the Tang Monk’s root. He further said, *\"If you can revive the tree, I will bow to you eight times and take you as my sworn brother.\"* For friendship is the mutual aid of having and lacking, and fraternal love is the support of hand and foot.\n\nThe immortals’ path begins with action and culminates in non-action—having is none other than non-being. If one cannot act as having, how can one act as non-having? The Buddha’s path begins with non-action and arises from action—non-being remains being. If one cannot be without non-being, how can one be with being? In silent accord and shared intent, they originally form a single principle, all seeking the same method of reviving the dead.\n\nThough this passage speaks of the Monkey King’s quest across three isles for a remedy, it truly reveals the two schools’ unity in their original source. Could the Great Immortal not heal the tree himself? Yet he specifically invited Guanyin—this is to clarify that non-being precedes being, and to show that transformation has its wellspring. Though master and disciple each possessed their own spiritual root, they deferred to the Immortal Zhenyuan—this is to clarify that the self resides within others, and that their qi is not two.\n\nFrom this discernment and pursuit, even the Three Stars of the Eastern Sea could not surpass its wonder. Naturally, they converged at Wuzhuang Temple, adding longevity, fortune, and prosperity. Even the Eastern Flower Patriarch could not surpass its divinity, and so extolled Wuzhuang Temple as a blessed land, a cave heaven, a spiritual root. Though the Nine Elders of Yingzhou could not advance further, they marveled at Wuzhuang Temple, hastening to welcome its master, offering him nectar to drink and jade lotus to eat.\n\nZhu Bajie tugging at the Star of Fortune to beg for fruit, rummaging about in chaos—this reveals his heavenly nature. Wukong laughing at Dongfang Shuo for stealing peaches without success, their mutual jesting—this too shows that it was not truly possessed. All these scenes, reflected through the ginseng fruit, in jest and play, truly convey that the ginseng fruit is not easily obtained.\n\nOnly upon reaching the rocky cliffs of Putuo and meeting Guanyin Bodhisattva did they recognize the subtle and imperceptible as the highest grade, the true flavor of Shaolin. Seeing that even the bear spirit had the affinity to attain the true fruit, how could the Tang Monk lack the means to save the spiritual root? Zhenyuan’s spiritual root was opened by Heaven; the sweet dew from the pure vase was wrought by the self.\n\nThe poem says:\n*\"To perfect the body of action, one must long practice the truly wondrous Dao.\nThis is indeed the true essence of the entire work.\"*\n\nThe *Diamond Sutra* states:\n*\"If one sees me in form, seeks me in sound, such a one walks the deviant path and cannot see the Tathāgata.\"* For the truly wondrous Dao is profound and difficult to perceive, lying entirely in the heart’s inward reflection and tranquil observation. To cling even slightly to sound or form is to depart from the formless, odorless original substance—such a one walks the deviant path and is cut off from the Tathāgata.\n\nIt further says:\n*\"All conditioned dharmas are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows, like dew, like lightning—contemplate them thus.\"* Some interpreters say that all conditioned things are illusory, understanding only the fleetingness of a galloping horse’s shadow or a butterfly’s dream, the spark struck from stone or the flower in the mirror—what real benefit is there in this? Those skilled in discourse assign a meaning to every word, never repeating themselves—how much more so the World-Honored One! These four lines are the essential pointer of the entire sutra; how can one reduce them to a single \"emptiness\" and treat \"dreams,\" \"illusions,\" \"bubbles,\" \"shadows,\" \"dew,\" and \"lightning\" as one and the same?\n\nThus, only by grasping the meaning of *\"like dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows\"* can one grasp the mechanism of *\"like dew, like lightning.\"*\n\nThe common folk fail to grasp the true essence of the *sweet dew* and the *dragged lightning* as the *lingering root’s* genuine virtue. They abandon the *suchness* of conditioned existence to enter the unconditioned, believing that through perception and insight they have attained awakening. Yet I do not know what they perceive, what they see, or what they awaken to. By the twenty-fourth night of the twelfth month, all will dissolve and vanish—deeply lamentable!\n\nThe *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* states:\n*\"If one follows the inclinations of all beings,\nthen one honors the Buddhas with supreme reverence.\nWith the water of great compassion nourishing all beings,\none cultivates the wisdom flowers and fruits of the Bodhisattvas.\"*\n\nWhen Guanyin arrives in the rear garden, she dips a willow branch into the *sweet dew* and takes the gentle and weak as the ferry into the Dao. She draws a *resuscitation talisman* on the practitioner’s palm, seizing it as the reins to congeal the *true essence*. Observing the water’s flow as the measure, she forbids violating the *Five Phases’* vessels, relying on *non-dependence* as the standard for action. The *lingering root* transcends the Five Phases and exists alone; the *sweet dew* nourishes the original transformation to benefit all things. The withered roots revive upon receiving it; the fallen fruits restore themselves. \"The fruit tree returns to life, gaining an extra one\"—is this not the clear proof of returning to the origin, restoring the root, and fulfilling the mandate?\n\nThis is indeed *\"nourishing with the water of great compassion to cultivate the wisdom flowers and fruits.\"*\n\n*\"The great immortal urgently commands taking gold to strike the child,\nknocking down ten, arranging them on the elixir field,\neach eating one—thus forming the gathering of the *rénshēng* fruit.*\nIt speaks of the *golden elixir* belonging to all; the great immortal merely hosts as an expression of fulfilling old debts. From this point, the *golden elixir* is complete—ingested, it revives the dead as one revived, like the dead returning to life. The treasure of the immortals is obtained; the foundation for the Western Heaven is laid. All are immortals of eternal youth—why fear not seeing the *jiao-liu* golden Buddha?\"\n\nThey become brothers; the two families merge into one. The wondrous Dao of ripening causes and conditions is thus fulfilled.\n\nIf scholars rely only on their own rigidity, refusing to yield, ponder, or seek instruction, how can they recognize the extraordinary *rénshēng* fruit of the Five庄 Observatory in the *Mount Wànshòu*?\n\nThus the patriarch said:\n*\"I possess a treasure, hidden in the *xíng* mountain.\"*\nDo the others recognize it?\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seventh: The Corpse Demon Plays Three Tricks on Tang Sanzang**\n\nThe Saintly Monk, having consumed the *rénshēng* ginseng fruit, now has the *golden elixir* within him. Henceforth, he has shed his mortal form and transformed his bones—his spirit refreshed, his body robust.\n\nYet after attaining the elixir, one must still clarify the mind and perceive true nature, discarding the common mortal form and exchanging it for the refined. If he fails to recognize truth, to see through illusions, if he appears merciful yet slips into indulgence, if he seems wise yet is blinded by cunning deceit, then his virtue may become excessive and invite *róngxié* perversity, his wisdom may falter and risk abandoning the right path!\n\nThus, the Corpse Demon’s three tricks are revealed, and the Saintly Monk’s resentment in driving him away is justified.\n\nThe Corpse Demon is none other than the *qì* shell of those who cultivate the Dao. Originally a malevolent spirit that deludes, it can mislead others unaware. It appears as a youthful beauty, yet is truly hollow white bone; it seems like a tender youth, yet is actually frail and aged; it masquerades as a living *bóshā* (菩萨), yet is in truth *jiūpánchútú* (鸠盘荼); it feigns pity, yet is merely a fool toying with others.\n\nFor the human body harbors three Corpse Demons, which resent one’s attainment of the Dao, and during moments of slumber, they accuse one of transgressions.\n\nThose who seek the Dao, if they cling to form and appearance without first annihilating the three Corpse Demons, will never escape the mortal shell nor ascend to the *Yùjīng* (玉京) of immortality.\n\nThus, those who cling to the body are like guardians of the Corpse Demon, and the Demon’s accusations against them are countless. Those who preserve the body must only focus on eliminating the Demon, for its schemes against them are unfathomable.\n\nHow great is the Demon’s power to bewitch and mislead!\n\nIn this chapter, *\"Sanzang was journeying to the Zōngyá place when hunger struck\"*—just when the Corpse Demon sought to claim him as its meal. The Pilgrim declared, *\"Master, you lack understanding!\"*—meaning he failed to see through the deception.\n\nSanzang, drowning in his own partiality and displeased, took this as a harm wrought by hunger, yet his clouded wisdom was the root of his straying from the right path.\n\nSince Sanzang subdued the Pilgrim at *Liángjiè Shān* (两界山), he has upheld the right and banished the false, combining both wisdom and courage—his deeds truly magnificent.\n\nThe monk also knew the Pilgrim could not be separated for an instant, so why did he suddenly grow angry at his lingering laziness, forgetting the favor of saving his life at *Liángjiè Shān*, yet acting as if he had done some great deed?\n\nThe author’s meaning is subtle!\n\n*Liángjiè Shān* is the place where right and false stand opposed. Earlier, when the Pilgrim was confined between its towering peaks, it was a test of perceiving true nature and the beginning of his fate. Hence, Sanzang subdued him to establish this foundation.\n\nNow, *\"journeying to the Zōngyá place\"* signifies the boundary of fate and the preservation of true nature—so Sanzang cast him aside as a warning.\n\nTo the Pilgrim, it showed that talent and cleverness are not to be relied upon, nor achievements to be boasted of.\nTo Sanzang, it revealed that *Mìluó*’s (汨罗) lone loyalty must be discerned, while *Huáiyīn*’s (淮阴) superficial merits are easily misjudged.\n\nThe chapter concludes with the Great Sage recounting *\"In Chang’an, there was Liu Bǒqīn who saw me off on my journey, and at Liángjiè Shān, he saved my life\"*—down to the lines *\"When the birds are done, the bow is hidden; when the hare is dead, the dog is cooked\"*—each word dripping with sorrow, causing all ages of heroes to weep in grief.\n\nYet suspicion and mistrust arise from the separation of *yīnrǒu* (阴柔) forces, while banishment often stems from the slanderous tongues of those who speak ill.\n\nEight Precepts mistook white bones for a fair visage, believing the devourer to be a monk begging alms—thus dragging maggot-tails as fragrant rice and toad-meat as fried gluten. The Three Temptations of the Corpse-Mara were but tricks to blind the eyes. The more one indulged, the more skillful they became, yet in the end, they could never deceive the discerning. The bones remained white.\n\nThe Great Sage’s slaughter was the act of one with keen perception. Yet even after repeated victories, his merit led only to slander and suppression, burying his loyal heart.\n\nThe world’s fickleness and affairs’ reversals are timeless—no cause for astonishment. Only when a brother envies his elder does strife erupt within the household walls, while a master’s disdain for his disciple sparks sudden rejection between teacher and student. When wood rots, worms infest; when suspicion arises, slander spreads. All stems from failing to turn away from evil or to uphold the good.\n\nThe *Qiaoyao Song* states:\n*\"To grasp fate’s command, to lose ancestral nature—\nLike a mirror without gems to hold one’s face.\nA life as vast as heaven and earth, yet a fool’s grasp,\nHolding wealth like a masterless pawn.\"*\n\nThus, one who embodies the innate luminosity without deceit is truly established in the Dao, achieving the utmost of effortless action.\n\nIn days past, Bodhidharma sat nine years facing the wall, penetrating truth through meditation, before returning to the West with but a single sandal—mastering the wondrous Dao of cultivating both life and nature. Beginning with the physical form, ending with its shedding.\n\nOne does not gaze upon white bones as if they were a fair visage, but as white bones; nor does one gaze upon white bones as white bones, but as a fair visage. Thus, one attains clarity.\n\nThere is a method of observing white bones, though it belongs to lesser teachings, yet worthy of note. Imagine the left big toe rotting, oozing foul fluid, gradually spreading to the calf, then the knee, then the waist—so too the right. Gradually, the rot spreads past the waist, to the abdomen, the chest, and finally the neck, until nothing remains but white bones. Observe them clearly, one by one, until, after long contemplation, you ask: *Who is it that observes these bones?* Then you realize the body is always separate from oneself.\n\nNext, observe the bones from a distance—first one *zhang*, then five, ten, a hundred, thousands—until you see that these bones have nothing to do with you. If you dwell on this reflection, you will know that the self and the physical form are two distinct things. The self temporarily resides within the form—why cling to it forever, dwelling within it?\n\nThus, one may equalize birth and death, achieving a profound insight into shedding the shell and transcending the world.\n\nThe *\"husband\"* in this passage refers to one who shares the same journey and fate as me—not a spouse in the conventional sense. If mistaken as such, it remains one layer removed, not the immediate Corpse-Mara.\n\nAt first, the illusion took the form of a beautiful woman, with moon-like features and flower-like grace. Though clearly a demon, the Elder did not recognize it. With sweet words, it offered *\"this meal to the monk.\"* Eight Precepts nearly succumbed—his nature driven by food and desire, yet unable to take its form.\n\nWhen the Pilgrim returned and saw through the deception, he struck it down at once, crushing the false corpse beneath his palm. In an instant, maggots writhed and toads leapt. Was desire truly his nature? Or was it not?\n\nThen the illusion took the form of an old woman.\n\nThe aged one is not like the youthful man—his face wrinkled like a crumpled silk pouch, the very same as the earlier fair young woman.\n\nThe Pilgrim recognized it, raised his staff, and struck. The false Corpse-Mara was again cast aside beneath the roadside.\n\nIn a blink, the young became aged, the aged became dead, and the dead turned to withered bones. Was the young one truly in peril? And the aged even more so?\n\nThen the illusion transformed into an old man.\n\nThe Pilgrim laughed, *\"I am the ancestor of the Tooth-and-Nail Tiger—how dare you hide a ghost in your sleeve to deceive me? I know you are a demon!\"*\n\nAs the Great Sage’s staff rose, he felled the fiend, revealing its true form—a row of characters on its back: *\"White Bone Matron.\"*\n\nIn the passing moment, the young aged, the aged died, and the dead became desiccated. The young, the aged, the dead—all reduced to a single White Bone Matron.\n\n「Though it be called *\"Three Illusions\"*, it is in truth like the *\"Three Precepts\"*;\nThough it be called *\"Three Slayings\"*, it is in fact the *\"Three Births\"*.\n\nThe Tripitaka Master did not regard it as a kindness, but instead as a grievance;\nHe did not see it as a merit, but rather as a crime—how deeply deceived he was!\n\nWhat difference is there between this and the *\"Five Relationships\"* of one who marries three orphaned wives,\nYet is accused of assaulting his mother-in-law;\nOr the case of *Zeng Can* who thrice reported a murder,\nOnly to see his virtuous mother cast into grief?\n\n*\"The wise fail to awaken the ignorant—only adding to their confusion,\"*\nTaking paper and ink to write a letter of censure,\nWith rewards and punishments unclear, actions reversed—\nHow lamentable! How thrice I sigh!\n\nThus, those who attain the Dao/Way as masters have the clear discernment of slaying the *Three Corpses*,\nAnd controlling the *Three Pests*;\nThey possess the full ability of *Three Hair-Cutting* and *Three Marrow-Washings*.\n\nIf one cherishes only the body’s shell,\nYet fails to recognize it as mere white bone—\nThen when the *yin-qi* invades and harasses,\nHow long before one escapes its grasp?\nThe *yang-virtue/power*’s observation and judgment\nShall never rise above!\n\nIt remains the state of the Monkey King unvanquished in the *Two Realms*,\nThough he ingested the *Golden Elixir*,\nYet still fell prey to demonic hindrances—\nHow could he hope for a happy beginning and a happy end?\n\nThis holy monk’s regret in driving away the Monkey King\nAnd thus losing his own splendor—\nTruly, he deserves no pity!\n\nAs the Pilgrim prepared to depart,\nHis tears flowed unceasingly, his heart heavy with farewell,\nHe paid his respects with utmost sincerity,\nHis loyalty and devotion sincere and true—\nHis tender concern could not bear to leave,\nDeeply moved by the spirit of ancient loyal ministers\nWho, exiled from their homeland, still yearned for their lord.\n\nReading the lines:\n*\"Tears fell from his cheeks,\nHe paused mid-cloud, his steps halted—\nLong did he linger before departing,\"*\nI found my own eyes brimming with tears.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eighth: The Monkey King’s Troops Gather in Assembly**\n**The Black Pine Grove: The Tripitaka Master Meets a Demon**\n\n*Master Wuyi* said in *The Spring and Autumn Annals’ Rectification*:\n*\"When a subject serves his lord,\nIf three admonitions are ignored,\nThere is the ritual of abandonment.\"*\n\nIndeed, it was out of reluctance to see him punished\nThat he was merely abandoned and not used.\n\nThe Great Sage was exiled after slaying the *Three Corpses*,\nJust as one abandoned after three admonitions is suspected—\nThus, the Tripitaka Master relaxed his strictures\nAnd drove him away.\n\nThis was a case of *believing slander and distancing virtue*,\nActions misplaced and ill-advised.\nEven a mother’s kindness,\nOnce misapplied, becomes cruel and harsh.\n\nThe *qi* of indignation and fury,\nYet sometimes it reaches the heights of reckless and wild excess.\nWho is to blame for this?—\nOnly the flatterers.\n\nWhen the sovereign’s heart is clouded by confusion,\nAnd chaos stirs within and without,\nAll stand in peril—\nHow deeply this should be feared!\n\nThis is the source of the themes *\"Gathering in Assembly\"* and *\"Encountering a Demon\"*—\nThe guiding thread of the tale.\n*Yì* means what is fitting in conduct.\nThe bandits slaughtering common folk—\nTheir wickedness is extreme!\nYet why call it *\"Gathering in Assembly\"*?\nBecause the lord above values *virtue* (仁),\nAnd none below dare oppose what is deemed *righteous* (義).\nIf the lord above deems non-slaying of demons *virtue*,\nThen those below must surely deem slaying the innocent *righteousness*.\n\nWhen *virtue* and *violence* lead the charge,\nThen there is a pattern, a natural call—\nThe forces of destruction are summoned.\nYet thus it is:\nThe bandits’ *\"Gathering in Assembly\"* was not the Great Sage’s doing,\nBut the Tripitaka Master’s influence that made it so;\nThe Great Sage’s slaughter of the hunter was not his own act,\nBut the Tripitaka Master’s will that drove him to it.\nTo gather and to slay—\nOriginating in *violence*, yet justified by *virtue*;\nTo stop the killing, yet to open the door to more—\nEvil flourishes within the guise of good.\n\nTo gather and to slay—\nEmerging from the Monkey King,\nYet consummated by Eight Rules.\nTo exterminate demons is *not* *virtue*,\nYet to assemble them may be deemed *righteous*—\nGood concealed within the cloak of evil.\n\nAlas!\nIn this world, evil is indeed not to be done,\nYet good is also not to be done;\nGood can be twisted into evil,\nAnd evil can be dressed as good—\nSuch is the way of things!\n\nThe author sets forth his intent in *\"Remodeling Flower Fruit Mountain\"* to reveal how contradictions in taking and discarding, and distortions of beauty and ugliness, lead to inevitable harm—whereupon those between high and low cling to *virtue* and seize *righteousness*, inciting chaos and committing sins without restraint. What sorrow their ruin brings!\n\nWhen the Pilgrim was banished back to Flower Fruit Mountain and gathered demons to kill men, it was as if those who rebelled became compliant, and those compliant turned to rebellion—how could this not betray the Buddha’s sincere intent to tame the Monkey King’s rebellious heart?\n\nThe Great Sage said:\n*\"A thousand days of good deeds leave virtue still insufficient;\nOne day of evil leaves evil in excess.\"*\nThough these words reflect the Great Sage’s reflection, they are truly the Tripitaka Master’s own confession.\n\nHe who confesses his own crimes and invites demons upon himself—\nThe root of his suffering lies in *\"heeding deceitful nature and unleashing the heart-monkey.\"*\n\nThis *\"unleashing the heart\"* is yet another layer deeper than the earlier *\"unleashing the heart\"*—\nNot the *\"unleashing\"* that casts aside good for evil,\nBut the *\"unleashing\"* of failing to discern *righteousness* and *virtue* deeply enough,\nWhereby evil is taken for good and good for evil.\nOnly those whose *righteousness* is refined and *virtue* mature can grasp this truth,\nWhile the vulgar and deluded cannot fathom it superficially.\n\nThe profound allegory and wondrous symbolism of this chapter,\nAll centered on *\"Yellow Robe Lord\"* as its core,\nTruly extends through to the thirty-first installment,\nWhen the Beautiful Monkey King returns to Flower Fruit Mountain and dons the saffron-yellow robe.\n\nIn the Dao of the Golden Elixir,\nGold is the husband, Wood the wife—\nHarmonized and united, neither can dominate.\nNow the Beautiful Monkey, having been banished, covets the Wolf’s seat,\nAbandoning the Golden Lord for the Wooden Mother—\nChaos and inversion prevail.\nHe who once opened the way to Flower Fruit Mountain and offered the Yellow Robe,\nNow, banished to Flower Fruit Mountain, yields his throne to the Yellow Robe.\n\nWhy?\nBecause Gold has waned while Wood has flourished.\n\nWithin this tale, the Yellow Qi Mother falls into ruin,\nwhile the Red Boy faces peril—\nthe Great Dao has already plunged into the City of Delusion,\nand none can rouse or rescue it.\n\nThe Monkey King, with no other choice,\nthus returns to his roots and origin,\ngathers righteous allies to plot his restoration—\ncould he truly forget his own nature,\nso casually abandoning the Triple Treasure?\n\nWhat is meant by *\"Yellow Robe Lord\"*?\n\nThe constellation *Kui* belongs to Wood and overcomes Earth.\nHe who is overcome by me is my wife—\nEarth’s hue is yellow, thus the Yellow Qi Mother;\nhe who overcomes me is my husband—\nWood overcomes Earth, thus the Yellow Robe Lord.\n\n*\"Robe\"* signifies Wood encasing Earth from without,\nforming the garment of yellow soil—\nand when the Yellow Robe is donned,\nit symbolizes seizing the moment to exercise power.\n\nHis depiction of the demon’s form,\nas *\"Green Face Blue Hands\"*,\nreflects Wood’s verdant hue.\n\nAs for Tang Seng, having ingested the Golden Elixir,\nhis enlightened spirit is now obscured—\nhis nature has fallen into the City of Delusion,\na state of being alive yet drawn toward death.\n\nJust as one lost in the Black Pine Forest,\nstumbling in a daze,\nunaware of retracing his steps,\nand blundering into the Yellow Mire’s wicked domain.\n\nThat fiend, hearing he was a monk,\nlaughed aloud: *\"This is a ‘snake’s head, a fly’s fate—\nclothing and food it shall be!\"*\n\nThen he roared with mirth: *\"I said you were a highborn traveler,\nand indeed you are! Now I shall devour you!\nAs you are destined for my feast,\nI must strike you down!\"*\n\nThe demon’s grip is unyielding—\nhe cannot be let go, nor can he escape.\nSuch words all expound the meaning:\n*\"Heaven’s path is shunned, yet hell’s gate is forced—\na proverb’s truth: ‘Yama does not summon, yet he comes to surrender.’\"*\n\nThus, he summoned both disciples and attendants,\nhorses and baggage—all at once—\nwhile the flesh of the *Soul-Stabilizing Stake*\nwas nearly swallowed whole by the *Star of Greed’s* maw!\n\nMaster Tripitaka’s life was already forfeit,\nyet Sha Wujing still sought the alms-giver,\ngreedy for worldly flavors—\nlike a fool still lost in dreams,\nbewildered and dim-witted,\nunaware that the true master was already lost.\n\nOnly when they reached *\"Bowl Mountain, Moon-Cave\"* did they realize it was a demon’s domain—\na vessel of devouring, sucking in tongues like sustenance.\n\nThe cave, a den of *\"Skin\"* and *\"Moon,\"*\nwas a place where broken, rotting limbs\nwere truly the birthplace of human flesh—\nand its final resting ground as well.\n\nWhat is given to the master returns to the master,\nwhat is taken from others returns to them.\nWhile he craves my flesh,\nI seek to turn his alms into my own—\nyet fools of the world, when will you awaken?\nSwiftly strike with ruthless force,\nand battle this old demon to the end!\n\n**The Twenty-Ninth Chapter**\n*Escaping the River’s Peril to Reach the Realm*\n*The Eight Precepts’ Grace in Exile Among the Mountains*\n\nA sage once spoke:\n*\"Obscure and dark, yet within it lies essence;\nFleeting and vague, yet within it lies purity.\nIts purity is most true, within it lies faith.\"*\n\nIn this chapter, the **Hundred-Flower Shame** of the **Treasure-Elephant Kingdom**, seized by a demon as a false couple, vanished without trace. Yet fate brought her to the **Tang Monk**, who carried letters and messages in return—\na tale of destiny unfolding.\n\nThirteen years prior, on the **Mid-Autumn Night of the Thirteenth Year of Zhenguan**—when the stars aligned with *\"Zhenguan Year Thirteen, Auspicious Autumn Day\"*—the journey for the **Sutra** was truly a quest for **Treasure**. When the heart first set out, the Treasure had already taken form. As the saying goes:\n*\"When the mind is set, the **Mysterious Pearl** manifests its image.\"*\n\nThus, though the **Tang Monk** wandered in obscurity and illusion,\nunaware, **true faith** subtly permeated his path.\n\nThis was the very year and month when the **demon ensnared the Princess**—\nwhen the chapter began:\n*\"Delusion cannot be forcibly extinguished,\nTrue **Dao** need not be desperately sought.\"*\nMeaning:\n*\"To sever delusion only deepens suffering,\nTo turn toward **Suchness** is itself a deception.\"*\n\nIf one but aligns a single thought with **True Practice**,\nall defilements vanish—\nand the moment of **delusion and awakening** is instantly clear.\n\nYet now, the **Tang Monk**’s single thought remained lost in confusion,\nignoring the **Golden Essence**,\nlost in his **original nature**,\njust as when he had been adrift in the river’s peril—\nbound like an ignorant child to the **Soul-Stabilizing Stake**,\nabandoned as an infant, floating on a board,\nlife hanging by a thread,\nlost in darkness and illusion,\na masterless wanderer.\n\nWho knew that within this chaos,\nthe **Princess**’s question arose—\nfor **Earth** harmonizes the **Four Symbols**,\nsecretly birthing **Metal** from its depths.\n\nFrom this moment, **faith** subtly connected,\nand the river’s peril could not be escaped.\n**Water** and **Earth** converged,\nand the **Golden Princess** returned.\n\n**Earth**’s function was true—\nthe **Princess of the **Kun Palace****.\n\n**Zhu Yang** said:\n*\"The Five Phases and Four Symbols rely entirely on Earth,\nThe Three Elements and Eight Trigrams cannot do without **Ren**.\"*\nWithout **Ren**, the Three Elements and Eight Trigrams cannot form,\nwithout **Earth**, the Four Symbols and Five Phases cannot unite.\n\nThis **Princess of Kun** was the one who saved the **River’s Peril**.\nYet **Ren-Water** thrives in **Shen**,\nand must pass through **Earth’s Shen** to complete the **Kun** form—\nonly then could **demons be dispelled and awakening preserved**.\nThe **Monkey of Shen** relies on **Earth** to act—\nits meaning is profound.\n\n**Eight Precepts** and **Sha Wujing** could not prevail in battle,\nfor **Wood** cannot subdue **Wood**—\nyet **Wood** can subdue **Earth**.\n\n**Hundred-Flower Shame** was the **Literary Leader of the Ladies’ Class**,\nwhile **Third Princess** was the **Young Maiden of Kun Palace**.\nThe **\"Treasure-Elephant Kingdom\"** was the direction where **Geng-Metal** emerged—\ntruly the **key path** for the **Sutra Journey**.\nThe **\"Soul-Stabilizing Stake\"** was the **hidden meeting** where **incense-faith** was transmitted—\nthe true **target** for saving the master.\n\nWhen battle raged,\na sudden cry rang out—**\"Yellow Brother, abandon your blade and cease fighting!\"**—\nfor **Earth** governs **stillness**.\n\nFirst, the **Tang Monk’s** bonds were undone,\nthen the **false dream of the Golden Spirit** came to fulfill its vow and rescue the monk—\n**deception made real**.\n\nThe verse reads:\n*\"Narrowly escaped the **Green-Faced Beast**,\nFortunately met **Hundred-Flower Shame\"**—\nto show that **Wood**, bearing green hues, became a spirit,\nwhile **Flower**, leading the **Spring Festival**, bore **faith**.\n\n**Faith** is **Earth of the Mind**.\nThe **Young Maiden of Kun**, having given birth and nurtured,\nis called **\"Baba\"** when a woman reaches maturity—\nshe who mediates between husband and wife, the **matchmaker**.\nThus, the **Princess** is the **Yellow Baba**;\nthe **Tang Monk** is the **Innocent Child**.\n\nA mother must protect her child—\nthus, **faith in action** brings escape from peril.\nA child must care for its mother—\nthus, **faith’s arrival** keeps the monk behind.\n\nThe king received the letter and immediately asked his ministers and generals, *\"Who will save the Princess?\"* No one answered—truly a case of **wooden idols and clay statues** without resolve. For **Wood** cannot cut **Wood**, nor can **Earth** overcome **Earth**; what was already suppressed must rely on the **justice of the Golden Spirit**. Even the **Wood Spirit** like Eight Rules and the **Earth Spirit** like Sha Monk are but one-sided forces, unable yet to triumph decisively. The **rebellious demon** must be countered by none other than the **Golden Spirit**, and they must urgently devise a plan to return.\n\nThe ministers and generals proposed the Tang Monk, who then spoke of his disciples. Though they transcend the mundane and exhibit extraordinary transformations, how could they ever meet the true **Golden Spirit** and stand alone to achieve merit? Eight Rules, though master of great transformations, remains bound to **Wood**. The Foolish One said:\n*\"The east wind may yet suffice,\nThe west wind will soon be enough—\nBut if the south wind rises,\nIt will blow the heavens into a gaping hole.\"*\n\nThe text calls this **\"foolish speech,\"**\nyet it is the truth.\n\nWhy? Eight Rules is the **mother of Wood**—\nwhen the east wind first grows strong,\nthe west wind fades away;\nbut at the height of summer,\nwhen the south wind blazes red,\nit can surge to the skies and ascend straight—\nthis is the true principle of transformation.\n\nEight Rules drank wine in gratitude and ascended the clouds first;\nSha Monk drank wine to aid and urged the clouds to hasten.\n**Water and Earth** united in heart,\nand together they shattered the demon’s lair.\n\nThis is the logic:\n*\"He who seeks to conquer my strength must save my strength,\nAnd he who seeks to conquer my strength must be overcome by my strength.\"*\nYet they could not escape this fate.\n\nEight Rules, though exerting no greater power,\nwas ensnared in the wilderness,\nbetraying the king’s favor.\nSha Monk, caught off guard,\nwas trampled and bound—\nlosing the support of his limbs.\n\nEight Rules is **Wood**;\nthe Yellow Baba is **Earth**.\n**Wood** cannot save **Earth**,\nyet it could shelter itself by clinging to **Wood**—\nthus, the man slept peacefully in the vines.\n\nSha Monk is **Earth**;\nthe Yellow Demon is **Wood**.\nWhen **Wood** prevails, **Earth** is ensnared,\nyet even in bonds, it could swiftly be freed by its master.\n\nAlas! The Princess,\nthe **Earth of Kun’s Palace**,\nis the **inner Yellow Baba**;\nSha Monk,\nthe **Earth of Flowing Sands**,\nis the **outer Yellow Baba**.\nBoth **Earths** entered the cave—\nthough divided as inner and outer,\nthey share the same **qi**,\nwith wondrous mutual aid and harmony.\nRead the next installment to see this unfold.\n\n**The Thirty-First Chapter:** *The Demon Invades the Dharma, the Horse Remembers the Monkey, the Ape Recognizes the Mind.*\n\nThe Sage said:\n*\"He who masters the Yellow Divide must regulate the spleen;\nHe who understands the body’s treatment must honor its root.*\nThe **Middle Palace** nourishes the hundred bones—\nwhen the spleen is regulated, illness is cured;\n**the people’s lives** are the extreme foundation of all transformations—\nwhen the root is steadfast, the nation is secure.\n\nIf **original qi** is not strong,\nand **evil qi** invades the organs,\npeople blame **evil qi** for the harm,\nyet it is not **evil qi**—\nthey themselves weaken **original qi** and invite it.\n\nIf **internal warfare** is not quelled,\nand **external warfare** presses the gates,\npeople rage at **external warfare** for its calamity,\nyet it is not **external warfare**—\nthey themselves create **internal warfare** and brew it.\n\nThus, the **demon’s** reckless actions\ncan submerge the **Dharma** and harm the **Law**,\nwhile **desire** without a master\ncannot follow the heart and obey commands—\nsuch is the inevitable force.\n\nThe **Daoist practitioner** follows the same principle\nas treating illness or governing a nation.\nWhen **Central Earth** is lost,\nthe **returning nature of Metal** is thwarted,\nthe mind is confused and life in peril—\nthis is its natural course.\n\nThe old demon abandoned Sha Monk in anger,\nfuming over the news of the Princess’s letter,\nknowing well that **external chaos stems from internal warfare**,\nyet unaware that the Princess’s **faith**,\nthe **faith of returning to the Dharma**,\nwas the true **faith**.\nThe demon’s blade, raised to strike,\nwas also an attempt to let **evil submerge the Dharma**.\n\nThe Princess clung to life in defiance,\nher **faith** unshaken.\nYet once **faith** had taken action,\nspeaking truth would lead to ruin—\nfor there are matters in the world\nwhere **faith** need not be spoken to prove itself.\nThis is their kind.\n\nSha Monk’s prevarication on their behalf\nwas not **faith**,\nyet once **faith** had taken action,\npointing to reality would bring harm—\nfor there are principles in the world\nwhere one may lie with words\nwithout faulting the heart’s **faith**.\nThis is their kind.\n\nThe Princess and Sha Monk,\nunited in **faith**,\ntransformed and harmonized as one **qi**,\nmutually saving and protecting each other.\nThe master saves the monk,\nthe monk saves the master,\nthe master saves the monk again,\nthe monk saves the master again—\na ceaseless cycle,\ndarkly yet effectively at work,\nultimately achieving great success,\nall from the **true and unerring nature of faith**.\n\nThe Half-Mountain Sage once said:\n*\"Knowing deceit as deceit,\nyet deceit becomes truth.\"*\nThis is the Princess and Sha Monk’s **trickery of the demon** and **coaxing of the demon**.\n\n*\"Recognizing deceit as truth,\neven truth becomes deceit.\"*\nThis is the Tang Monk and Eight Rules’ **driving away the monkey** and **transforming into the tiger**.\n\nIn days past, the Great Sage endured the **oppression of the Second Prince** and fled as a **tiger in flight**—\nthis was of his own volition.\nThe Second Prince swiftly used the **mirror of demon-revealing**,\nbranding the Sage as a demon.\n\nNow, the Tripitaka Master suffers the **Yellow Demon’s** calamity and is trapped as a **tiger in a cage**—\nthis was not of his own volition.\nThe Yellow Demon slowly wielded his **crafty tongue**,\nturning **good into evil**.\n\nThe root of their misfortune\nlies in the Tripitaka Master heeding Eight Rules’ **slanderous words**,\nand thus wrongly exiling the **pilgrim**—\nso the pilgrim returned to **Flower-Fruit Mountain**,\ngrieving over the Second Prince’s **oppression**.\nConsequently, the king also misplaced trust in the Yellow Demon’s **crafty speech**,\nwrongly recognizing his beloved son-in-law,\nand the Tang Monk was detained in **Treasure-Elephant Realm**,\nwhile the Yellow Demon’s **magical obstruction** ensnared him.\n\nThe king took the old demon as his ideal son-in-law,\nand the holy monk as a ferocious tiger—\njust as the Tripitaka Master mistook the **White Bone** for a **beautiful maiden**,\nand the **demon-slaying** for **harming the good**.\n\nWhy did the old demon suddenly shift from fury to joy\nafter the Princess’s letter and Sha Monk’s persuasive arguments?\nIt was not merely that he was truly fooled by the Princess and Sha Monk—\nhe also turned their **faith** against them,\nusing this very **faith** to deceive the kingdom\nand devour the monk.\nHe suppressed his petty anger,\nhoping to sell his grand treachery.\n\nThus, the Princess held a feast to calm her fright,\nyet the demon suddenly changed his attire—\nclaiming to visit the kingdom to meet kin,\nonly to transform into a scholar at court.\n\nHow marvelous! How wondrous!\nThe Immortal Sage’s hidden meaning\nsubtly warns future rulers:\nthose who judge men by words alone,\nbestowing empty honors,\neven seizing power,\ndrowning in wine and lust without restraint,\ndevouring the innocent without remorse,\nand betraying loyal ministers while defying the sovereign.\n\nHow so?\nThe **Kui constellation** is the celestial **Literary Star**,\nwhile the yellow robe is the earthly **armor of the Yellow Emperor**.\n*\"On the fifteenth night of the eighth month, the Princess was taken away\"*—\nclearly, the osmanthus blossoms fell beneath the moon’s glow.\n*\"With an arrow, he shot the tiger to save the Princess,\nyet the tiger spirit disguised itself as a pilgrim seeking scriptures.\"*\nA web of flowery deceit,\nresembling the eloquent strategies of the **Golden Gate examinations**.\n\nAt court, he spewed **Dharma-water**,\ninstantly stripping the monk of his true form—\nfangs and claws bared, devouring the **Treasure Hall**,\nhis words could weave a **embroidered tiger** from his mouth.\n\nFeasting on delicate maidens,\nhe relied on the **Divine Steed’s** swordplay—\nyet met his match with a **full-court flush** in the leg.\nTruly, his hands could cleave a **carved dragon**,\nhis words as they were, his deeds as they were—\na scholar without virtue—\nhow could he not be feared?\n\nThus, the virtuous do not elevate men by speech alone,\nwhile the sage ruler must judge by **truth and sincerity**.\n**Truth** is the unerring, the unfeigned.\n\nThe four seasons follow the **Dao** of Heaven and Earth without fail,\njust as the tides of rivers and seas rise and fall at their appointed times without error.\n\nWhen the Five Relationships lack **truth**, they collapse;\nwhen the hundred virtues lack **truth**, they perish.\nThus, when ruler and subject share the same **virtue**, governance flourishes,\nand when husband and wife align their hearts, progeny thrive.\nYet if superiors and inferiors deceive one another,\nand inner and outer circles resort to deceit,\nthere has never been one who did not meet ruin—\nbody lost, family destroyed, nation fallen.\n\n**\"Truth\"** is the word of a person,\nspringing from the heart and governed by the mouth.\nWhen words do not come from sincerity, they become **deceitful speech**;\nwhen falsehoods flow from the lips, they become **long-tongued slander**.\nDeceitful speech confuses the ears,\nwhile slanderous tongues topple cities.\nBecause of **embroidered tigers** woven from lies,\nQu Yuan drowned himself in loyal grief,\nand because of jealous slander,\nBai Qi died on a peak of filial betrayal.\n\nTo invert right and wrong,\na deer may be called a horse;\nto confuse true and false,\na boar may be mistaken for a pig.\nEven the golden cicada transforms into a ferocious beast,\nand boundless affection turns into a blade of cruelty—\nall are harms wrought by the **tongue-demon**.\n\nThat the **Three Treasures** turned into a tiger—\nwhat is there to find strange in that?\nYet the old demon, recognizing kin,\nfirst used the pretense of hunting tigers as a means,\nhis words skillfully planted.\n\nIn general, deceitful men advance their schemes\nby first feigning intimacy;\nonce intimacy is feigned, flattering words find easy purchase,\nthen they seek to establish merit;\nthrough merit, favor is secured.\nThus, smooth-tongued flattery ensnares the golden-headed monk in an iron cage,\nwhile sharp-tongued venom devours the green-faced demon in song and dance.\nWhen such words arise,\nwho does not weep in sorrow?\nOnce a horse’s servant,\nhow could one not bow in submission?\nThe Small Dragon manifested from his body,\nbowing to save the master—\nsuccess or failure, profit or loss,\nwere not his concern.\n\nLoyal ministers and righteous warriors\nshould be stirred to action by this.\nThe Wood Mother’s grief drew him forward,\nthe Golden Official’s urgency brought him back—\nscattered, then reunited;\nobscured, then clarified.\nCould this not be the work of a single sincere thought,\npenetrating near and far?\n\nMarvelous indeed!\nThe Small Dragon twisted in flattery,\nsinging and dancing to his desires.\nWith a sideways glance, he seized the moment—\nfive flowers, eight gates—\nstriking when defenses were low.\nWhat difference was there\nbetween the dagger of the **Poisoned Arrow** or the hammer of the **Surfing Wave**?\nThough the deed was not yet complete,\nit was enough to stir the heart.\n\nYet when the **full-court flush** struck the dust,\nhe barely escaped with his life by the river’s waters.\nCrouched in endurance, his few companions wailed in grief.\nAs the poem says:\n*\"The horse and ape scattered, the golden and wooden withered,\nthe Yellow Wife parted ways, and **Dao** and righteousness grew thin.\"*\nTruly, a cause for lament.\n\nEight Rules suddenly awoke from his dream,\nhearing the white horse speak with human words.\nRecalling the White Tiger Ridge and the White-Boned Lady’s tale,\nhe knew the tiger’s transformation stemmed from the white bones,\nand the yellow robe arose from the white bones.\nFrom constraint came regret,\nfrom regret came enlightenment—\nthe very mechanism to turn peril into safety.\n\nThe Small Dragon spoke:\n*\"He is a monkey king of **ren** and **yi**,\nwho will surely seize the demon and save the master.\"*\nThis was the appearance of a true person,\nwhile the demon’s evil faded—\nthe strategy of **End Wood** and **Pure Source**.\n\nWith tears dripping from his mouth,\nhis words were earnest and sincere—\nhow could Eight Rules not devote himself wholeheartedly?\n\nEight Rules saw the **Pilgrim**,\nthen slunk away toward the grassy cliff,\n*\"sliding and dodging\"*—\nthe utmost in shame and reluctance.\n\nThe **Pilgrim** saw Eight Rules,\ntook his hand and led him to the Water Curtain Cave to play,\ndemonstrating his lingering affection for seclusion.\nYet because Eight Rules did not speak truly\nbut instead feigned sincerity,\nthe **Pilgrim** also pretended reluctance\nand withdrew to the groves.\n\nEight Rules departed—\nwas he truly gone?\nHe feigned separation to deliver later words;\nthe **Pilgrim** did not go—\nwas he truly unwilling?\nHe lingered to demand true sincerity.\n\nEight Rules, after parting, turned back to curse,\nhis anger driving him to pursue;\nthe **Pilgrim**, though not leaving, secretly followed,\nprobing the truth to ensure he did not depart.\nBoth harbored hidden schemes,\nyet neither forgot the master.\n\nNow that the **Pilgrim** had obtained true sincerity,\nhow could he not reveal his true heart!\n\n---\n**Chapter 31: Eight Rules Rouses the Monkey King with Righteousness**\n**The Pilgrim Subdues the Demon with Wisdom**\n\nThe sage **Treasured One** said:\nIn **Pali**, *\"Shakyamuni\"* is the same as the Chinese *\"Neng Ren\"*—\n**\"Ren\"** governs life, **\"Yi\"** governs killing.\nKilling to protect life,\nkilling is thus life.\nTo be able to give life but unable to kill—\nthat is not **true compassion**.\n\nThe **Pilgrim**’s killing of the White Bones was **Yi**,\nand truly **Ren**.\nEight Rules deemed it un-**Yi**,\nthe **Master** deemed it un-**Ren**,\nand thus suffered unjust demotion.\nThis is called **\"internal Ren, external Yi\"**\n—not knowing that **Yi** is **Ren**.\n\nEight Rules, moved by the Dragon Horse’s earnest admonition,\nregretted extinguishing the White Bones,\nand knelt to beg the **Pilgrim** to rescue him from his peril—\nthis was to release **Ren** with **Yi**,\nrestoring him to his post as **Grand Councilor**,\nand granting him authority over life and death.\n\nThus the Small Dragon said:\n*\"He is a monkey king of **ren** and **yi**,\nwho will surely seize the demon and save the master.\"*\nIn terms of **Ren** and **Yi**, this was the operation of the **Great Dao**;\nin terms of **Metal** and **Wood**, this was the marvel of **elixir alchemy**—\none **yin**, one **yang**,\none husband, one wife,\ntheir inversion and union never to be separated.\n\n**Metal** is **Yi**,\n**Wood** is **Ren**.\nWood clings to Metal in obedience to **Yi**,\nMetal cherishes Wood in practice of **Ren**.\nMutually beneficial, they achieve the **True Fruit**.\nRooted in **One Nature**,\npaired with the **Original Spirit**—\nthough called brothers,\nthey share the same **qi**;\nthough called demons,\nthey partake of the Five Phases.\nIf one could sever worldly attachments\nand return to the origin,\nthen **Great Awakening** would be attained.\n\nThe opening word of this chapter is most lucid.\nYet the **Dao** of **Ren** and **Yi**\nrelies on **truth** as its foundation.\nTo a person, **truth** is as essential\nas **water, fire, metal, and wood** are to **earth**.\n\n「Water, fire, metal, and wood cannot generate without earth,\nnor can a person stand without **truth**.\nThe **Pilgrim** rejects the Eight Precepts yet fails to practice them,\nfor he hates their words being untrue.\nOnce a word is untrue,\nthen no bond can be formed,\nnor can good deeds be hidden.\nThus, the Monkey King’s decree was delivered:\n*\"That Eight Precepts is not honest at all!\"*\nIn anger, he seized him back.\n\nThe Beautiful Monkey, sparing the **Bodhisattva**’s face,\ndeclared:\n*\"I will not strike you—\nonly speak honestly,\ndo not deceive me!\"*\nDishonesty is untruth;\nhonesty is **truth**.\nThis corresponds to the **truth** in the Princess’s entrusted letter.\n\nThe **Way** of subduing demons and returning to purity\ndepends on genuine sincerity.\nOnly this **truth** can turn the tide,\nforbidding trickery or deceit.\n\nThe **Pilgrim** said:\n*\"Though my body returns to the Water Curtain Cave,\nmy heart remains with the **Taking Scripture Monk**.\"*\nA loyal subject, though banished from his kingdom,\ncannot bear to forget his lord for a single day;\nthe Great Sage, though returning to his mountain,\nwould never endure a day’s neglect of the **Monk**.\nThus, his earlier refusal was not his true intent—\nhe seized the Eight Precepts only to hasten their journey.\n\nThe Eight Precepts, sensing the **Pilgrim**’s intent,\nflailed wildly and cried:\n*\"Look at that empty path—\nhow splendid to run!\"*\nWhy? Knowing the **Pilgrim** would seize him,\nhe feigned useless words and instead\nadopted the posture of fleeing through the air,\nto provoke the **Pilgrim**’s swift resolve\nand reveal his genuine sincerity.\nThis was the **Way**’s subtle art—\na feigned shadow to lure the true spirit.\n\nThe tale unfolds:\nThe Black Pine Grove’s golden pagoda shines;\nthe Princess entrusts her letter;\nthe Yellow Robe Demon disguises himself as a refined scholar,\nenters the palace to claim kinship with the king,\nand transforms the **Master** into a tiger.\nThe White Horse says:\n*\"Our elder brother is a man of **Ren** and **Yi**.\"*\nThese are the very events and words spoken—\nyet the **Pilgrim** remains unaware,\nhis anger flaring, his heart stirred.\n\nBut one provocation alone would not suffice—\nwhy? For the **Pilgrim** was bound by the **Monk**’s command;\nthe demon was not.\nIt is as if the **Pilgrim** were a retainer\nleft by the king to perform duties,\nyet not permitted to stay.\nThus, the demon’s insult was enough to rouse him—\nif the **Pilgrim** acted for the sake of subduing demons,\nnot for saving the **Monk**,\nor for personal vengeance,\nnot for the **Monk**’s suffering,\nthen even without the **Monk**’s command,\nhe could act.\nHence, the **Pilgrim** feigned compliance to resolve his own dilemma:\n*\"It is not that I cannot go—\nsince the demon has insulted me,\nI will accompany you!\"*\nThis was the Great Sage’s radiant principle,\nhis ingenious expedient—\nunfathomable to others.\n\nThe Great Sage then strode out the gate,\nbut the monkeys blocked his path.\nHe explained:\n*\"I protect the **Taking Scripture Monk**—\nthis is known throughout heaven and earth.\nThey did not drive me away,\nbut sent me home to play in ease.\"*\nNow, this departure seems grand,\nyet not truly for the sake of the **Monk** or himself.\nEarlier, his rejection appeared as if the **Monk** loved him\nand thus banished him,\nspared him from toil,\nfor **Ren** and **Yi** transcend mere paths.\nWhen the **Pilgrim** plunged into the sea to purify himself,\nit was to cleanse his heart and thoughts.\nThe Eight Precepts recognized the **Pilgrim**’s sincerity,\nwith no ulterior motive.\nNow, **Metal** and **Wood** unite,\nand **truth** flows between them—\nwhat could not be accomplished?\n\nYet, a skilled commander avoids the enemy’s sharpest strikes\nand strikes where they are weak;\na master of exorcism follows the demon’s wild display,\nthen seizes its opening.\nIf one lacks the strength of restraint,\nbut only the boldness of fury,\nadvancing too forcefully,\ndemanding too much,\nhe will be warned against such recklessness.\nThus, subtlety alone can harmonize all under heaven;\ndepth alone can fulfill all undertakings.\n\nFrom ancient times, great heroes\nhave never subdued demons or dismissed flatterers\nwithout employing wisdom and strategy—\nthis is how the Great Sage’s intelligence\nconquered the Yellow Robe Demon,\nembodying the **real practice** of **Ren** and **Yi**.\n\nThe **Pilgrim** seized the two minor demons.\nTo capture the father, he first took the son—\nattacking what must be rescued;\nto save the mother, he must abandon the son—\nremoving the cause of her suffering.\nTo exchange two for one,\nwhile the **Sand Monk** untied the bonds—\nthis was **earth** saving **earth**.\n\n*\"Like milk poured on the head,\nsweet dew nourishing the heart—\nthe moment the truth is revealed,\njoy fills the heavens,\nspring blooms within the chest.\"*\nThis is the **true scene**, not mere embellishment.\n\nThe Princess reproached the Pilgrim for lacking integrity, while the Pilgrim countered that the Princess acted unfilially. Both examined Daoist principles at their roots: one feared a husband’s power over her, seeking to preserve her own trustworthiness; the other relied on the Princess’s attachment to him to fulfill his integrity. The Princess entrusted her message to him—an act of filial piety—while the Pilgrim subdued the demon to uphold righteousness and complete her filial duty.\n\nRighteousness fulfills trustworthiness, and trustworthiness fulfills righteousness. Emotion and righteousness unite in strategy, while wisdom acts within. Thus, the Princess concealed herself, and the Pilgrim transformed his appearance.\n\nWondrous indeed! *\"The Pilgrim changed into the Princess’s likeness.\"*\n\nGold can overcome water, yet why does it reverse to earth to sweetly endure wood’s dominance? The *Suishu* states: *\"Without deceitful tactics, how could one pacify rebels and break through deceit?\"*—this is how he fulfilled his trust.\n\nLaozi says: *\"The tongue is soft, the teeth hard. The teeth are hard, so they break. The tongue endures without wear because it is soft.\"* Softness thus accomplishes hardness.\n\nSunzi says: *\"To take what you desire, you must first give it.\"* Giving is precisely how you take it.\n\nThe Pilgrim’s transformation as the Princess—trustworthy yet employing deceit, hard yet yielding softness—embodied the subtle Dao of giving to take. Like a cat dragging a mouse, he wailed pitifully, feigning mercy, mimicking a woman’s heartbreak at parting. Or like a hedgehog in a tiger’s mouth, he acted meekly, hiding his thorns, portraying a husband’s cruelty toward his child, bewitching others with seductive wiles.\n\nHe disrupted marriages while pretending to uphold them; he killed children while weeping for them; he stole treasures while devouring them. All was won through wisdom, not by outward appearances.\n\nWhen the Pilgrim revealed his true form, he transformed into three heads and six arms—changing three oddities into six pairs, restoring the cosmos, aligning Heaven and Earth so all things flourished. This mirrored the *Bua* hexagram’s reversal into *Fu*, the symbol of renewal.\n\nThus, in the following chapter: *\"Tang Seng regained the Monkey King, and they proceeded westward, encountering once more the season of spring.\"*\n\nThe Great Sage drove away the subterranean demon and uncovered the celestial constellation of Kui. The Jade Emperor dispatched his officials to subdue it, and the Princess of the Treasure Elephant’s origins were revealed. In an instant, she was returned to her homeland, where her parents reunited, fulfilling her wish to send the message and Tang Seng’s duty to deliver it. Earlier, through flattery, the water-spraying mouth lost its nature and altered its form; now, with true incantations, the demon’s qi retreated, and its original body was restored. No longer was there the confusion of the White-Bone Lady.\n\nFor evil and righteousness diverge, yet the conflict hinges on a single thought. True and false intermingle in enlightenment, ultimately sharing the same source. The Princess’s sincere trust led her from falsehood to truth, exhausting the path.\n\nIf one mistakenly takes falsehood for truth, then the demon is not the Sage—even if elixirs are swallowed, it remains like releasing a stolen heart. How could one fail to discern this?\n\nThe Great Sage returned to the Three Treasures, though as a disciple returning to his master, it was as if his heart reunited with his body, or a ruler restored to his kingdom—*\"When the heart is upright, all is upright; when the ruler is virtuous, all are virtuous.\"*\n\nThus, the concluding words: *\"The king returns to the treasure hall to stabilize the realm, the monk proceeds to the Thunderclap Peak to seek the Buddha.\"*\n\nFrom the twenty-eighth chapter to this point, it is clear that after obtaining the elixir, one must still awaken to nature and clarify the heart. From striving to rest, from labor to ease, gradually reaching the state of *wuwei* and transformation. The meaning will be clear in the subsequent chapters’ dialogues between master and disciples.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two: The Official of Pingding Mountain Delivers the Message, the Wood Mother of the Lotus Cave Meets Disaster**\n\nA disciple of enlightenment said: If one understands the profound meaning of the six characters *\"Pingding Mountain, Lotus Cave,\"* then the following three chapters—where mountains press down, elixirs are refined, and illusions of Heaven and Earth are fabricated—along with the four chapters involving the As-You-Wish Jewel and the Golden Snare binding Sun Wukong, the gourd containing the Pilgrim, the female Nuwa mending the sky with stone, the banana fan’s true fire, and the bottle containing Sun Wukong—all their mysteries will be revealed.\n\nAs for the mountain, why is it called *Pingding*? At the beginning of the chapter, it states: *\"The master and disciples were of one heart and body, all heading toward the Western Land.\"* West refers to the *Xie* (兑) position.\n\n*Xie* is the hexagram of the maiden, depicted as (☵☰☵), three lines: one yin above, two yang below—two metals and one earth.\n\nThe three lines of *Kun* (☷) form *Xie*; *Xie* is the maiden, the upper line of *Kun* (☷☵).\n\nCollectively, the six lines of *Kun* represent six hundred *li*. Below *Xie* is (☰☰), two yang lines—belonging to *Qian* (☰), metal—symbolizing the Golden Angle and Silver Angle, representing mountains. When the earth star is level, the metal star forms angles, likening mountains.\n\nThe Buddha said: *\"I have a treasure hidden in the Form Mountain. Do you all recognize it?\"* Master Yuanjue Chan said: *\"At the top of the head, shining brightly—this is the Dao without Dao, called the true Dao.\"* This is like the pearl within the oyster, the profound meaning of Pingding Mountain.\n\n*\"Within it is a cave named Lotus.\"* Flowers are the manifestation of yang qi. The lotus blooms when yin follows the peak of yang, as in the *\"Awakening to Reality\"* passage: *\"Next, the red flower emerges, followed by yin.\"* And *\"The maiden’s flower first blooms in the northern land.\"*\n\nSince *Xie* is the maiden, she internally nurtures the golden lotus, embodying the Five Treasures, capable of transforming treasures into demons or demons into treasures. Those refining the elixir believe demons possess treasures; by activating their spiritual mechanisms, they can steal the Purple-Gold Gourd. Ultimately, the gourd still belongs to Sun, as demons are transformed into elixir through demonic illusions.\n\nIf one doubts that treasures are not demons and complacently indulges in idle speculation, unable to escape the **幌金绳** (deceptive golden noose) and **圈套** (traps), then Tang Seng will still be devoured by the demon’s mouth—thus, transforming humans into demons through human illusions.\n\nThe Master Ziyou said:\n*\"The righteous practicing evil methods will see those methods return to righteousness;\nThe wicked practicing righteous methods will see those methods return to wickedness.\"*\nUpside and downside, forward and backward—all arise from this, entering and exiting one another. Only when the **灵台** (numinous platform) is clear and one thoroughly understands the core principle will there be no doubt or fear.\n\nThus, I specially cite a few lines from the *Heart Sutra* to guide the lost.\n\nAgain, fearing that one may not grasp the *Heart Sutra*’s profundity—without first establishing a foundation—yet hastily rushing toward non-action—I also cite:\n*\"After completion of the work, when causes cease and the method becomes empty, naturally the body attains ease,\"*\nto clarify the sequence of effects.\n\nThe **功曹** (official of merit) transforms into a woodcutter to deliver the message.\nThis message elucidates the **宝象国** (Treasure-Elephant Kingdom)’s **百花羞** (Hundred-Flower Shame), emphasizing the infallibility of year, month, day, and hour to record the truth of its transmission, thus tightly linking it to the preceding passage as a guiding outline.\n\nThe most awakening phrase is *\"must be in a stupor.\"* Why?\nThe *Rites* say: *\"A bride is wed at dusk.\"* This signifies the union of yang departing and yin arriving.\nAdding the maiden to marriage—few do not become stuporous upon marriage. To encounter this demon without stupor is impossible in this world.\nThe *Odes* say: *\"That stupor is not wisdom.\"*\nAnd again: *\"Behold your dazed state.\"*\nTruly deserving of tears and lamentation.\nThe Pilgrim weeps once, now wishing to recruit a heart-friend to jointly refine this demon.\n\nFor if one is weak in strength and solitary in form, then standing before the furnace will be futile;\nBut with united hearts and cooperative effort, the true fruit can be attained.\nThe master and disciple understand this at a glance, hence:\n*\"To cross this mountain, one must have Zhu Bajie.\"*\n\nThe pig is the **亥木** (Hai Wood), and wood can generate fire. If one does not grasp the subtle timing of fire and instead loses heart and scatters their efforts, how can they gather and apply their work?\nWithout Bajie’s fierce support, yet constantly invoking *\"scattering the fire,\"* this is the first and greatest peril of elixir refinement.\nThe patrol of the mountain was to exhort students, to probe the hidden truths within, and to caution against self-deception that leads to ruin.\n\nThe account of Bajie’s deceit and doubt reveals that while people may laugh at his stupidity, they fail to recognize that it mirrors the deluded misconceptions of all students under demonic influence—worthy of tears. Thus, the Pilgrim coldly laughs in place of weeping.\nThis cold laughter is more painful than tears.\n\nThe immortal master, fearing readers might not grasp the figurative depiction, specially adds the phrase *\"drawing shadows and depicting forms,\"*\n—one to show the **Dao/Way’s** divine essence, the other to convey the figurative intent.\nIf one says, *\"This is the marvelous method of capturing the spirit through depiction!\"*\nDoes it truly describe Bajie’s stupidity?\nOne must truly comprehend the **red grass slope** where he stretches his waist—his heart in stupor and vision obscured;\nThe **woodpecker’s beak bleeding**—his heart in stupor and speech unguarded;\nThe **flying ear** struck again—his heart in stupor and hearing dull.\nWith the three external treasures (eyes, ears, mouth) failing, his heart’s obstinacy has already turned to stone.\nHe takes the **Stone Monkey** as teacher and friend, yet the mountain and cave are all stone.\n*\"My heart is not stone,\"* yet he claims there is gold within, mistakenly pointing to the gold vein and recklessly guessing *\"nailing iron leaves to the door.\"*\nIs this the true meaning of the *Heart Sutra*?\n*\"Old Pig’s heart is flustered and cannot recall the truth\"*—a concise summation.\n\nWith the three internal treasures (mind, breath, spirit) failing, his heart’s doubt has already turned to a ghost.\nThe tiger passes, the wind blows, the crows call—animals, plants, and all things are ghosts.\n*\"Loading a cart with ghosts,\"* yet not personally receiving direct instruction, he assumes he can forcibly guess transformations and attain the demon’s perverse heart-realm by himself.\nSelf-surprised and self-blamed—what fault is there with others?\n\nThe **golden and silver kings** of Pingding Mountain’s Lotus Cave—are they not present before one’s eyes?\nOnce captured by a single drumbeat, they suffer misfortune—all due to failing to grasp the true message of fire timing and instead blindly acting in error.\n\nThe immortal master, embodying Heaven’s teachings, uses the metaphor of *\"drawing shadows and depicting forms\"* to illustrate the image of the **dragon-horse bearing the diagram**, revealing the source of the Dao, hence *\"five mouths linked to the horse.\"*\nThe master and disciple’s single diagram clarifies the *River Diagram*’s **three-five** essence, all emanating from the **太极** (Supreme Ultimate).\n\nAh! These few words of profound mystery are difficult to describe—yet a single brushstroke of vermilion and indigo captures the marvelous transformation.\n\nAfter carefully studying the last three sections, one attains their profundity.\n\n---\n**Thirty-Third Chapter: External Path Misleads True Nature, Original Heart Assisted by the Primordial Spirit**\n\nMaster Yu-Yi said:\nThe **Dao/Way** of the **golden elixir** originates from the *Zhou Yi* (Book of Changes) **Eight Trigrams**, which in turn originate from the *River Diagram*.\nHeaven does not cherish the Dao, so the **dragon-horse bore the diagram** and emerged, guiding the ages of confusion—this is the *\"true scripture without words.\"*\n\nThe *Lo Shu* diagram: **one, nine, three, seven** occupy the four cardinal directions;\n**two, four, six, eight** occupy the four corners;\n**five** resides at the center.\nFor **gold and water** generate each other—**Heaven One** and **Earth Four** combine as **one-five**;\n**wood and fire** generate each other—**Earth Two** and **Heaven Three** combine as **one-five**;\n**earth’s number** resides at the center, as **one-five**.\nThe Five Phases gather and harmonize—**three-five**’s wondrous convergence—an endless cycle of primordial essence.\n\nYet:\n**Heaven One** generates water, **Earth Six** completes it;\n**Earth Two** generates fire, **Heaven Seven** completes it;\n**Heaven Three** generates wood, **Earth Eight** completes it;\n**Earth Four** generates metal, **Heaven Nine** completes it;\n**Heaven Five** generates earth, **Earth Ten** completes it.\nThe logic of generation unfolds in forward and reverse, hidden and revealed, beyond measure—all due to the **先天真一之气** (preheavenly true unity qi) spiraling within.\n\nThe adept cultivates the elixir, knowing the Five Phases in their **sequential order**—wood can generate fire;\nknowing the Five Phases in **reverse order**—the mother conceals the child in the womb.\nYet fire can in turn generate wood, for within the yang lies the true yin—**the profound mystery of Heaven Three generating wood**.\n\nThe adept knows the Five Phases in their **sequential order**—metal can generate water;\nknowing the Five Phases in **reverse order**—the child returns to produce the mother.\nYet water can in turn generate metal, for within the yin lies the true yang—**the genuine essence of Earth Four generating metal**.\n\nThose who understand this are called **enlightened**, not deceived by external Daoist teachings;\nthose who attain this are called **divine**, not exceeding the primordial origin’s inherent power.\n\nZǐ Yóu said:\n*\"To exhaust one’s heart is to know one’s nature;\nto know one’s nature is to know Heaven.\"*\n\nThe knowing know this, the exhaustive exhaust this—nothing more.\n\nThe metaphors within this passage—**embedding Heaven** and **releasing Heaven**—are but **the universe within a sleeve, sun and moon in a jar**, fundamentally no stranger than the ordinary.\n\nThe **Immortal Master** expounds these principles to reveal their subtleties, disseminating them widely among both refined and common folk, so that the wise and foolish alike may witness them and thus hope to **grasp their meaning intuitively**.\n\nFor instance, at the passage’s outset:\n*\"Taking the Eight Precepts into the cave\"*—the Eight Precepts, wood by nature, are **restrained by Heaven Four’s metal**.\nImmersed in the **Pure Water Pool**—\nthe Eight Precepts, wood containing fire, are **subdued by Earth Six’s water**, thus **encountering demonic forces in their natural order**.\n\nExamining the diagram:\n**San Zàng** represents the **Supreme Ultimate**.\n*\"Only seeing auspicious clouds wafting and celestial qi swirling\"*—this is the **intermingling of Heaven and Earth’s primordial vapors**.\n*\"The traveler before the horse drops his talismans—above three, below four, left five, right six\"*—\nif taken literally as a **superficial interpretation of the text’s constraints**, one loses its **profound meaning**.\nIf the talismans are understood as **three odd and four even, five flowers and six doors**, one also misses their **true essence**.\n\nThe **talismans before the horse** properly demonstrate the **Dragon Horse’s *Hé Tú* numbers**.\nHeaven Three generates wood, Earth Four generates metal—**three and four** are the **metal and wood** in union.\nMetal and wood **converge through earth**, hence **left five** is Heaven Five generating earth,\nand **right six** is Earth Six completing water.\n\nThe **essence of refining the elixir** is thus **comprehensively outlined in the entire diagram**.\n\nYet, **Three envelops Heaven One**—**Heaven One generates water**—**Earth Two generates fire**;\n**wood contains water**, **metal contains fire** as well.\n**Three and Five interpenetrate**, **Heaven Seven completes** it.\n**Metal clings tenderly to wood**, **wood yields to metal**—\n**Three and Five interpenetrate**, **Earth Eight completes** it.\n**Three and Five combine into One Five**, **One Five combines into One Earth**—\n**Three and Six interpenetrate**, **Four and Five interpenetrate**, **Heaven Nine completes** it.\n**Wood can generate water**, **metal can generate fire**—\n**Four and Six interpenetrate**, **Earth Ten completes** it.\n**This exhausts the principles of yin and yang, the Five Phases**, and their **cyclical generation and decline**.\n\n**Five and Six interpenetrate**—**having reached Ten**, they return to One**—\n**still One, the primordial *Tài Jí* (Great Polarity)**.\n**This encompasses the Dao of reversing perverse applications and restoring harmony**—\n**for within it lies the Way**.\n\n**Only here does the *qi* of the Primordial One**—\n**swirling above, below, left, and right**—\n**reveal itself as an entire *Hé Tú* (River Diagram) and *Luó Shū* (Luo Book),\n**a complete *Zhōu Yì* (Book of Changes)**.\n**Yet when the elixir discards the path of perverse application**, **its true Dao is already manifest**.\n\n**The stroke of a true immortal’s pen!**\nThus, the demon beholds it and says: *\"Words are not in vain—truly authentic.\"*\n\nThe *Fu* (Joy) manifests as the White Tiger—\nwhen the tiger is about to devour a man, it must first humble its posture.\n\nThe demon sought to deceive Tang Seng well,\nso it first assumed a yielding, humble form,\nto trip his footing and disrupt his center—\nthus becoming a demon.\n\nFor *Fu* is the fifth hexagram of the *Zhōu Yì*,\na transformation of *Shì* (Obstruction)—water and mountain.\n*\"The traveler bears [the demon] on his back,\"*\nits *Gèn* (Stopping) aspect—\n*Gèn* is mountain, stopping his back,\nso he halts and cannot proceed.\n\nMountain and marsh exchange *qi*—\nthus it dispatches the mountain.\nWhen dispatched three times, it becomes three *yīn*,\nadded to three *yáng*, forming *Tài* (Peace).\nThe marsh-mountain *Xián* (Binding)—\nthat is *Dì-Tiān Tài* (Earth-Heaven Peace),\ncalled *\"Tài Mountain presses the head,\"*\nearth above heaven.\n\nThe Five Phases of the two realms’ mountains,\nthe two *qi* of Tài Mountain—\nonce united in the Primordial,\nentering the Post-Heaven—\nhow could it not stop his back,\nhalting him from moving?\n\nThus it seized Sha Wujing and seized Sanzang,\nall halted and unable to proceed.\n\n*\"The Purple-Gold Red Gourd\"*—the *Lí* hexagram, fire,\nbelonging to the heart, held by the cunning ghost;\n*\"The Sheep-Fat Jade Pure Bottle\"*—the *Kǎn* hexagram, water,\nbelonging to the kidneys, held by the nimble insect.\n\n*Kǎn* and *Lí* cannot be separated—\nusing the gold gourd, the jade bottle follows,\nby natural law.\n\n*\"Bottom up, mouth down\"*—\nthe inverted symbol,\nable to reverse and restrain *Lí*-fire so it does not flare upward,\nable to melt all true essences—\nthus it is Laozi’s treasure for refining the elixir.\n\nWhy does it respond when called and enter?\nSound is the *qi* of the heart.\nLike sounds attract, like *qi* seeks its match.\nAs the *Lí* palace’s female call,\nit summons the *Kǎn* palace’s male to harmonize.\nThus it can transform elixir into demon,\nor demon into elixir.\nThe marvel of resonance lies only in response or no response,\northodox or perverse application—\na single breath, a single inhalation.\n\nThe Great Sage pressed beneath the Five Phases Mountain—\nthis is the Dao-heart unable to leave the dust.\nThis pressing beneath Tài Mountain—\nthis is the Dao-body unable to leave the world.\nHence the sighs of *\"tree too tall,\" \"name too high.\"*\n\nFor those who wish to transcend the dusty cycle,\nnothing surpasses embodying the Complete True Dao.\nTo embody the Complete True Dao,\nnothing surpasses refining and ingesting the Golden Elixir.\nWhat is precious is sudden awakening—\nthen the spirit and clarity naturally arise.\nThis is the Original Spirit aiding the Dao,\nso heavy burdens may be removed,\nshoulders’ loads may be set down,\nand the Purple-Gold Gourd treasure\nno longer manipulated by demons.\n\nThe traveler transformed into Old Complete True,\nself-proclaimed immortal,\nnot only saving himself\nbut wishing to save others—\nhis magnanimity truly encompasses heaven and earth.\n\nThe claim of *\"packing heaven\"* is not baseless,\nyet why cannot heaven truly be packed,\nand only the request to *Nèzhā* borrow\nTrue Wu’s black-embroidered banner from the North Heaven Gate,\nto obscure the sun and moon of the South Heaven,\nto deceive the two demons?\n\nThe sage intended another meaning—\nthus setting this symbol,\nto expose those who falsely claim immortality,\nwho use the River Chariot to transport water for brain-washing,\ndeceiving the world with gold and jade treasures,\nwhile obscuring the true, empty nature of the Original Heart.\n\nThose who falsely claim immortality\ndemand money upon meeting.\nGreedy and deluded men\nknow only of refining gold and silver,\nhoping to gain their methods—\neven the most meticulous and nimble,\nonce encountering them,\nwillingly revere, believe, and submit,\nnot sparing true treasures,\nfearing to be left behind in sincerity.\n\nThough they do not rob in broad daylight,\nthey truly deceive in darkness.\n\nThe traveler transformed into a seven-*cùn* Purple-Gold Red Gourd,\nresembling a human form.\nThe *Zhǎng Fǔ* records:\n*\"A *cùn* of land, a *cùn* of field—\nenough to sustain life.\"*\nThe *Huáng Tíng Jīng* says:\n*\"A *cùn* of land—this is the face,\nthe space between the brows is the *cùn* used.\"*\nNow it is *\"seven *cùn*\"*—\nthus encompassing the middle field, lower field,\nand connecting to the seven orifices.\n\nThe human body is also a Purple-Gold Red Gourd—\nin measure, it can pack heaven.\nIf the Golden Elixir is not obtained,\nit is but a false form—\na false gourd.\nWithout the true capacity to pack heaven,\nit must resort to deceiving heaven with trickery.\n\n*\"Nèzhā treads the Wind-Fire Wheel\"*—\ncomparable to the River Chariot;\n*\"True Wu’s black banner\"*—\ncomparable to the Dark Water;\n*\"North Heaven Gate\"*—\ncomparable to the Water Palace;\n*\"South Heaven Gate\"*—\ncomparable to the Vertex;\n*\"Sun, moon, stars\"*—\ncomparable to the two eyes.\n\n*\"Toss up the gourd, unfurl the black banner,\nobscuring sun and moon\"*—\ncomparable to transporting water upward to the vertex,\nto brain-wash and close the eyes.\n\n*\"Heaven and Earth dyed black, the cosmos stained indigo\"*—\nis this mere empty talk?\nSuch methods are truly inking heaven and earth—\nlike standing on a perilous cliff over the苦海,\none slip, and you plummet into the abyss,\nnever to return.\nTremendous danger!\nTremendous danger!\n\n「How much better to release the heavens,\nand not engage in the trickery of transporting and obscuring—\nto let the azure sky and white sun\nshine forth with the light of true noon!\n\nAlas, what of those cunning and clever fiends,\nwho take falsehood for truth as a means to sustain their families and prosper?\nThey lose their true nature and stray from their original heart—\nhow pitiable this is!\n\nIf readers mistakenly view the Two Demons’ *shifting of mountains* as external Dao deceiving the true,\nor the Six Jian’s *transporting of mountains* as the primordial spirit aiding the original heart,\nthey are superficial in their understanding.\n\n**Chapter 34**\n*The Demon’s Clever Scheme Traps the Monkey King*\n*The Sage’s Flight Fools the Treasure*\n\nWuyi Zi said: The *Yin Fu Jing* states:\n*\"Heaven has five thieves—those who perceive them flourish.\"*\n\nIf a person can perceive them and practice in reverse,\nthen the cosmos lies within their grasp,\nand myriad transformations arise from the heart.\nHeaven is the heart.\nThe five thieves are the five elemental natures inherent within the heart.\nEach element manifests its own nature,\nand they mutually harm and destroy one another.\nMy primordial *qi* is all stolen by them,\nand the heart of heaven is thus ensnared.\n\nIn the passage, the Two Demons declare:\n*\"We possess five treasures.\"*\nThese are the five elemental natures.\nIf one perceives them,\nwhile the heart discards all illusions,\nand the body becomes as vast as the Great Emptiness,\nthen weapons become treasures;\nif one cannot perceive them,\nwhile the heart gives rise to stray thoughts,\nand they mutually suppress one another,\nthen weapons and treasures turn into thieves.\n\nThe text concludes with the Sage saying:\n*\"You old fool, if you let your servants run wild,\nyou’ll be held accountable for failing to restrain them.\"*\n\nLao Jun replied:\n*\"This has nothing to do with me.\nSuch trials are the fate your disciples must endure.\nWithout this, they cannot attain true fruition.\"*」\n\nSun Wukong’s heart now understood those words and penetrated their true meaning.\n\nThe *\"Jade-Gold Red Gourd\"* symbolizes the **Li** fire—flaming upward, externally yang yet internally yin. Its fiery nature like a gourd, red in hue, embodies the **Wǔgōng** (Three-legged Crow) and the sun’s essence. The *\"Mutton-Fat White Jade Flask\"* symbolizes the **Kǎn** water—gentle and moist, externally yin yet internally yang. Its smoothness like jade, white in color, is the **Yùtù** (Jade Rabbit) and the moon’s purity. The *\"Seven-Star Blade\"* symbolizes the **Jiǎn** (Mountain) and **Duì** (Lake) meeting in metal, the nature of earth and water converging in breath. The *\"Banana Leaf Fan\"* symbolizes the **Zhen** (Thunder) wood and **Xùn** (Wind) wind, the clash of wind and thunder. The *\"Shaking Golden Lasso\"* symbolizes the **Qián** (Heaven, firm) and **Kūn** (Earth, yielding)—the two *qi* intertwining, long and short as they will, swaying uncertainly, the very essence of the central land. In form, it encompasses the eight trigrams; in substance, it belongs to the five elements. The mother and child demons each hold one treasure, each embodying its nature, hence their monstrous forms.\n\nThe lesser demon, lost in delusion, attempts to usurp heaven, thus losing control of its elemental essence. The blame lies with the celestial assembly for deceiving with falsehoods, unaware of recognizing falsehood as truth. Their error stems from their own missteps—still groping blindly beneath the earth after their failed attempt to usurp heaven, unwilling to abandon the false, fearing the easy loss of truth while clinging to the false.\n\nThe Pilgrim transformed into a fly, and the Buddha’s *intention-jewel* also changed with him—this is the true principle. **Kǎn** and **Li**, the roots of creation, give birth to all things; their movement is inevitable. In the demon’s body, they are demonic treasures; in the Buddha’s, they are Buddhist treasures. Even a fly’s body can contain them—how could this be mere empty talk?\n\nThe two demons misused **Kǎn** and **Li**, losing their true nature. In anger at the false pretenses of the celestial deceivers, they sought to exploit the *intention-nature* by force, compelling the primordial *qi*. Thus, they begged the Old Mother to obtain the *Shaking Golden Lasso*.\n\nThe *lasso* is two strands intertwined, never unified. *Shaking* signifies doubt and confusion in the mind, without certainty. The nine-tailed fox holds it, for foxes are prone to suspicion; nine tails symbolize chaos. The *Chāibā Mountain Tiger* and *Yǐhǎi Dragon* display their mistaken grasp of dragons and tigers, boasting of their supposed prowess in subduing beasts.\n\nThe Pilgrim secretly observed their foundation, striking down their strength and transforming their doubt—what is taken for truth may still be false, while what is false may yet be true. Knowing falsehood as false makes it true.\n\nThe Pilgrim took the guise of an old nurse entering the cave, and Eight Rules mocked him for exposing his tail, revealing the truth hidden within falsehood—something that cannot be entirely erased. The demon king sought to offer Tang Sanzang’s flesh for longevity, while the Pilgrim demanded to cut off Eight Rules’ earlobes for wine, exposing the urgency of discarding falsehood within falsehood. Both ears must listen keenly.\n\nThe True Person’s teachings are not idle; they are not mere objects of ridicule or jest. The Dao of the Primordial does not cling to form or sensation, nor does it fall into perception and hearing. Round and radiant, it bears no trace—neither thread nor particle.\n\nThe Pilgrim had no choice but to manifest and disperse, transforming into a crimson glow filling the cave—*gathered, it forms shape; dispersed, it becomes qi*.\n\nAs the *Vajra Unveiling* states:\n*\"If one seeks me through form, or calls me through sound,\nThat person walks the wrong path and cannot see the Tathāgata.\"*\n\nThus, those ensnared by form and sound remain prey to the tiger’s jaws, while those trapped by names and appearances are but hollow reeds.\n\nWhen the Pilgrim used the golden lasso to snare the demon king, it became the demon’s own lasso binding its body—how could it escape its own trap? When the demon king used the lasso to snare the Monkey, it was demon confronting demon—how could it harm the Monkey’s slightest hair?\n\nThe two demons used the gourd to deceive the Pilgrim, calling him by name—this was seeking the Buddha through sound. Why not answer with false names to their delusion? The Pilgrim, in turn, called the demons from within the gourd—also using sound to deceive them, yet transforming falsehood into truth.\n\nTo break the golden lasso, a few strokes with a steel file suffice—wisdom manifests, and knowledge dissolves. To escape the gourd, a few shouts are enough—the physical form vanishes, and compassion pervades universally.\n\nThe golden noose tightens around the neck; the light behind it is still an illusion, yet liberation is still needed. The gourd’s darkness hides a treasure yet unrefined—urgent enlightenment is required.\n\nDo not say the gourd belongs to its master by clever artifice—\nBetter to borrow hands to achieve what comes naturally.\nIn an instant, it rises—*that is me.*\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Granted your schemes are cunning in a thousand ways,\nYet the gourd still bears the surname Sun.\"*\n\nSun Wukong—Wukong Sun. Forward and backward, inverted, all belong to the surname Sun.\nAh! From *\"surname Sun\"* one awakens to the mystery of sons and grandsons.\n\nTaking **Kǎn** to fill **Li**, returning to the exposed primal *qi*—*\"Catch a breath, and you’re off, disguised.\"*\n\nFools mistakenly guess this as the art of the bedroom.\n\n---\n**Chapter 35: External Paths Display Power to Deceive True Nature**\n**The Monkey King Steals Heaven’s Treasure and Subdues the Demon**\n\nA disciple of enlightenment says: The two young demons stole heaven’s treasures and became demons, turning the five treasures into five thieves. Sun the Great Sage stole heaven’s treasures and subdued the demons, turning the five thieves into five treasures.\n\nThe same heavenly treasures, the same act of theft—yet righteousness and evil are utterly distinct, depending solely on whether one cultivates or does not cultivate.\n\nGold, wood, water, fire, and earth—these are heaven’s treasures, and they are also humanity’s treasures. Heaven’s nature is humanity’s nature. If one exploits their nature one-sidedly, they mutually deceive and suppress each other: fire sees water as a thief, water sees earth as a thief, earth sees wood as a thief, wood sees metal as a thief, and metal sees fire’s force as a thief.\n\nEach thief is a thief to its own nature, each nature is its own nature—yet they lose their true essence. When their natures are harmonized, they mutually generate: metal generates water, and the true yang within water can generate the yin of metal, while the yin of metal in turn can generate the yang of wood, and thus metal and wood intertwine as treasures.\n\nWood generates fire, and the true yin within fire can generate the yang of wood, while the yang of wood in turn can generate the yin of water, and thus wood and fire are both at their fullest as treasures.\n\nThey intermingle as parent and child, alternating as husband and wife, and together they attain their treasures. This is what is called \"concentrating the five phases,\" reversing cultivation and transformation—just as **Nüwa** refined the five-colored stones to patch the sky.\n\nThe five-colored stones are earth. The method of cultivation relies entirely on the essence of earth. Earth has no fixed position, yet it governs the four seasons and embodies the central palace;\n\nFire, through it, does not flare,\nWater, through it, does not overflow,\nMetal, through it, endures long,\nWood, through it, does not wither.\n\nThus, *The Awakening to Reality* says: *\"The five phases and four symbols rely entirely on earth.\"*\n\nMetal, wood, water, and fire reside at the four corners,\nAnd when viewed through earth, they are **external Dao**;\nEarth dwells in the central palace,\nAnd when viewed through metal, wood, water, and fire, it is **heart-monkey**.\n\nThose who practice **external Dao** wield power\nAre one-sided in their exploitation of nature,\nNot the true method of **gold elixir**,\nHence they deceive the true essence.\n\nThose who attain treasures with **heart-monkey**\nCollect and harvest their treasures,\nObtain the true Dao of **gold elixir**,\nHence they subdue the evil demons.\n\nTwo key phrases, most clearly stated.\n\nReaders who rigidly insist that **heart-monkey** is the human mind,\nOr shallowly perceive **external Dao** as mere evil demons,\nFail to grasp their meaning.\n\nThe opening poem states: *\"One’s original nature is round and bright, the Dao naturally flows through.\"*\nA single phrase revealing the entire truth.\n\nIt further says:\n*\"Pure and turbid, how many times they turn with fate,\nThe eternal and the void, let them wander east and west.\"*\nIllustrating the five phases’ cyclical transformations and the marvel of generation.\n\nThus it is said: *\"This aligns with the Great Sage Sun’s profound Dao.\"*\n\nThe Great Sage Sun is also called **\"Xingzhe Sun\"**,\nWith a name that is ever-shifting—up, down, left, right,\nInverted without end—yet encompassing all phases.\n\nHe is the **central palace’s yang**,\nFor the Dao’s body is indeed such.\n\nThe **golden rope** of the previous section is also earth,\nYet it is vague and formless,\nWhile the Great Sage Sun obtained its **pure steel’s true gold**.\n\nBecause of this true treasure,\nHe entered the gourd without dissolving,\nFor earth can quench flames;\n\nBecause of this true treasure,\nHe then obtained the gourd itself,\nFor fire meets earth and returns to its form;\n\nBecause of this true treasure,\nHe acquired the **jade purity bottle**,\nFor water sees earth and unifies in chaos;\n\nBecause of this true treasure,\nHe gained the **banana-leaf fan** and **seven-star sword**,\nFor metal and wood meet earth and intertwine;\n\nBecause of this true treasure,\nHe reversed the **silver angle** and **gold angle**,\nFor gold and silver meet earth and return to their roots.\n\nThe opening line thus declares:\n*\"The Great Sage Sun attained the true treasure of the demons.\"*\nLinking past and present,\nTo show that the golden rope is the **true earth of the receptive female**.\n\nThis alchemy’s marvel of inverted control\nIs akin to Nüwa’s use of earth to repair heaven.\n\nHeaven is the ultimate yang,\nYet within yang there is true yin,\nSo Heaven One generates water and descends to nourish;\n\nEarth is the ultimate yin,\nYet within yin there is true yang,\nSo Earth Two generates fire and ascends to blaze.\n\nThe **creative male** and **receptive female** are likewise.\n\nThe **Dao Ancestor of Highest Venerability**,\nWith the yang of the central palace,\nRepairs the deficiencies of the creative palace,\nAnd enlightens all ages.\n\nThe **\"one stalk of immortal vine beneath the Kunlun Mountains’ foot, bearing this jade-red gourd\"**\nIs the supreme treasure for nurturing the elixir,\nAnd must not be overlooked.\n\nBy reasoning, originally there were two—male and female.\nYet the female within the male is false,\nWhile the male within the female is true.\n\nThe female cannot contain,\nFor the false cannot form the elixir;\n\nThe male can contain,\nFor the true can form the elixir.\n\n*\"Base upward, mouth downward\"*\nIs the logic of inverted correspondence.\n\nWhen the silver angle is contained and shaken,\nIt is white gold entering the fire palace,\nTransforming into one breath—\n\nThat is *\"Gathered and returned to one place,\nTurning into a pool of water.\"*\n\nThe progression now reaches **\"King Wen of the Zhou, Confucius, and other sages\"**\nAs the alchemists of old expound this principle,\nRevealing its origin.\n\nThe silver angle contained within the gourd and transformed\nIs not death,\nBut the demons returning to their true nature—\nThis is the act of **receiving life**.\n\nEight Precepts said: *\"Do not weep, let your younger brother recite the ‘Receiving Life Sutra.’\"*\nNot mere idle words.\n\nThe method of elixir-making\nFirst forges white gold as the elixir’s seed,\nWhile the **gentle wind** aligns with fire’s rectitude at this moment.\n\nFire is not ordinary fire,\nBut the breath of **purple charcoal**—\nThe five phases’ natural transformations and their arranged operations.\n\nThe **Old Demon’s fury in his heart** reveals the timing of fire’s function.\n\nPlacing the **jade purity bottle** aside and using the fan and sword instead\nIs the **gentle wind shaking the wood**, the **thunder emerging from earth**, and the **rising of the earth’s vigor**.\n\n*\"Gazing at the southern homocletic fire of Bing-Ding’s fan,\nOnly flames erupt from the ground—\nFierce and towering, scorching the sky and searing the earth\"*\nMarks the advance of the **yang fire**.\n\nThe Great Sage Sun avoided the fire,\nEntering the **Lotus Flower Cave** to take the **ram-fat jade purity bottle**;\nThe Old Demon retreated to the **stone table**, drowsy and silent;\nThe Great Sage Sun quietly extracted the **banana-leaf fan**,\nRevealing the retreat of the **yin symbol**.\n\nThe brilliance lies in the lines:\n*\"Causing gold and fire not to meet,\nThe five phases to disorder and harm the harmonious qi.\"*\n\nReaders assume the **gold angle** is metal,\nAnd **heart-monkey** is fire,\nThat metal and fire contend,\nA common principle of suppression.\n\nYet they fail to see:\nThe **Monkey King hides gold and water**,\nThe **gold angle sits within wood and fire**;\n\n「Water bears the **qi** of generating gold,\nFire bears the **qi** of generating wood;\nGold and wood share the **qi** of mutual support,\nWood and fire embody the **qi** of *jiéjì* [fulfilled/accomplished].\n\nWhen gold and water intermingle, and water and fire are reconciled,\nIf gold and wood do not unite, then gold and fire do not contend,\nAnd the lines—*\"The five phases disorder and harm the harmonious qi\"*—hold true.\n\nThose who cultivate the **elixir** [丹 *dān*] seek not for gold and fire to contend.\nWhen gold and fire contend, the five phases naturally flourish.\n*\"The Old Demon, defeated in battle, directly went to the Southwest to suppress the Dragon’s Retreat\"*—\nSeeking life from the source of my birth, pointing to *\"Southwest gains a companion\"* [得朋 *dé péng*];\nThus, he gained the aid of **Huli Seven** [狐阿七].\n\n*\"Huli Seven united as one, directly coming from the Northeast\"*—\nReturning to the source from where death comes, pointing to *\"Northeast loses a companion\"* [丧朋 *sàng péng*];\nThus, he fell to the **cudgel of Zhu Bajie** [猪八戒之钯 *Zhū Bājiè zhī yā*].\n\nWith both the **yang fire** and **yin symbol** exhausted,\nThe **gold angle** [金角 *jīn jué*] naturally returns to its origin.\nThe Great Sage Sun removed the **ram-fat jade purity bottle**,\nEnveloped the Old Demon, and called out, *\"Gold angle!\"*\nIn response, it vanished without a trace.\n\nBreath and resonance in harmony, no need for exertion;\n*\"Recalled the Seven-Star Sword, sweeping away all evil\"*—\nAll were true uses of **earth** [真土 *zhēn tǔ*].\n\nSeizing the moment unexpectedly,\nNaturally unfolding the **Heavenly Mechanism** [天机],\nNot through force, but the very essence—\nThis is the true meaning of *\"gold and fire contending without harming the harmonious qi.\"*\n\nThe **Highest Venerable** [太上] transformed the **blind man** [瞽者 *gǔ zhě*],\nDemanding the return of the five treasures,\nAnd explaining the cause of their theft:\n*\"Without this, the **true fruit** [正果 *zhèng guǒ*] cannot be attained.\"*\n\nHe said that without seeing these five thieves,\nOne remains like the **blind man**;\nBut if one can reclaim these five treasures,\nThen the **fruit** [果 *guǒ*] is secured.\n\nTransforming thieves into treasures and enduring hardships,\nThis is the inevitable path of those who cultivate the **Dao** [修道者 *xiū dào zhě*].\nWhat concern does the **Highest Venerable** have in this?\n\n*\"From the gourd and the jade purity bottle, two streams of **celestial qi** [仙气 *xiān qì*] poured forth,\nOnce again transforming into the two **gold and silver children** [金银二童子 *jīn yín èr tóng zǐ*].*\nReturning to its original nature and essence,\nAll is but one **gold** [一金 *yī jīn*].\n\nThis is precisely—\n*\"Floating and elusive, all return to Tiāntóu Palace [兜率宫],\nFree and unbound, ascending straight to Dàluó Heaven [大罗天].\"*\nThe marvelous effect of the **gold elixir** [金丹 *jīn dān*] is such.\n\nAspiring cultivators must urgently seek the secrets within\nThe **Lotus Flower Cave** on **Flat-Top Mountain** [平顶山莲花洞].\n\nYet then—\nThe treasure of the **gold gourd** [金葫芦 *jīn hú lu*],\nWhich the **gold angle** [金角 *jīn jué*] governs,\nWhy did it instead manifest as the **silver angle** [银角]?\n\nThe treasure of the **ram-fat jade purity bottle** [玉净瓶 *yù jìng píng*],\nWhich the **silver angle** governs,\nWhy did it instead manifest as the **gold angle**?\n\nThe **gold** enveloping the **silver**—\nTrue **masculine** [雄 *xióng*] transforming into false **feminine** [雌 *cí*],\nA reversal in **elixir cultivation** [结丹 *jié dān*];\n\nThe **jade** enveloping the **gold**—\nFalse **feminine** transforming into true **masculine**,\nA reversal in **transcendence and rebirth** [脱胎 *tuō tāi*].\n\nAlas!\nThe **Heavenly Mechanism** [天机] is nearly fully revealed.\n\nThe **Lotus Flower Cave** on **Flat-Top Mountain** [平顶山莲花洞]—\nI once read Master Matteo Ricci’s *Explanation of the Form of Heaven and Earth* [《天地形说》]: Heaven’s body is a vast circle, and Earth dwells fixed at its center. Above, below, and on all four sides are human figures, their soles facing each other in perfect alignment.\n\nFor the **qi** of Heaven is clear and ascends, while the essence of Earth is turbid and descends. All around are Heaven’s dominions, so Earth must naturally rest at the core. The very center of Heaven becomes the very lowest point of Earth—thus all figures stand upright, balanced within.\n\nThis elucidates the profound truth of the **Dao/Way** of **Emperor Yao**, **Shun**, and **Xi He** [羲和] onward, a revelation truly surpassing all ages!\n\nCalendrical calculations originate from Earth’s heart, yet through them the **Heavenly Mechanism** [天机] remains unexhausted—all this stems from the **soul’s luminous insight** [心之灵明神悟], does it not? Is this not the **soul’s embrace of Heaven and Earth** beyond measure?\n\nHumans indeed possess the **gold gourd** that contains Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Six**—\nThe **monkey-heart** [心猿] subdues all entanglements,\nSplitting open false paths to reveal the **bright moon** [月明].\n**Master Treu-One** [悟一子] said: *The Journey to the West* expounds the **unspoken truths** of the *Yellow River* and *Lo River* [《河》、《洛》], clarifying the **marvelous Dao/Way of inverted yin-yang** [阴阳颠倒之妙道], and pointing to the **true path of cultivation** for all ages.\n\nThe earlier text concealed its meaning in veiled metaphors, leaving none unexpressed. Now I reveal the **essential core** of past **immortals and sages** [仙圣], taking the *Awakening to True Reality* [《悟真篇》] as proof, to transmit the **gold elixir’s** [金丹] true essence. This is no mere **Chan School** [禅门] misconception of emptying the **soul’s power** [性] through worship and scriptural pilgrimage!\n\nA **clear mirror** [明镜] stills the waters,\nA **radiant moon** [皓月] illuminates the **Chan heart** [禅心].\nThe ancients and moderns who speak of the **Dao/Way** call this the **sage’s attainment of the Buddha’s path** [圣修佛诣], and here its peak is reached.\n\nYet the **sage’s** so-called **\"Divine\"** [神] has depths beyond knowing,\nAnd the **Buddha’s** so-called **\"Fruit\"** [果] is never truly absent.\n\n「Abandoning the affairs of Laozi, to whom else shall I turn?\nThe upper section reveals Laozi’s **Five Thieves** [五贼] to subdue the **heart-mind** [心君], which is **Internal Alchemy** [内丹]. In truth, it is the very principle of **External Alchemy** [外丹].\n\nThe principle knows no distinction between inner and outer,\nYet the **elixir** [丹] has both inner and outer.\nWhen the inner is established, the outer naturally follows;\nWhen the outer is attained, the inner naturally completes.\nInner and outer, outer and inner—\nInner yet again outer, inner and outer sharing the same source,\nCrushed into one seamless whole.\n\nThe **work** [功] spans beginning and end,\nThe beginning founds the end,\nThe end fulfills the beginning.\nAgain, the beginning is the beginning and end,\nThe end is the beginning and end.\nInner and outer, beginning and end—\nReversed and overturned, profound beyond measure,\nUnspeakable in words,\nThe **sage’s** so-called **\"Divine\"** [神] and the **Buddha’s** so-called **\"Fruit\"** [果].\n\nAt the start of the chapter, the **Master** [师父] spoke fully of Laozi’s affairs,\nThough it follows the previous text, it truly sets forth the next intent.\nThe practitioner says: *“Master, if one only subdues the nature and preserves the Divine, there is no need for further affairs.”*\nThis is the meaning of **still waters** [止水] and **Chan heart** [禅心].\nIf one can truly transcend affairs, what need is there for the elixir?\nThe **Three Treasures** [三藏] hope for long practice to reach the Western Paradise;\nThe practitioner laughs: *“You haven’t even left the outer gate yet!”*\nSaying that by subduing the nature and preserving the Divine, one naturally attains the golden elixir,\nThis is like hoping for the Western Paradise while yet unstepping through the outer gate—\nHence the saying: *“Do not cling to it; simply let your heart-mind go free and advance forward—\nThe work will naturally complete itself.”*\n\n“**Freeing the heart-mind**” [放心] means letting go of all attachments,\nYet it is truly the act of gathering the heart-mind without letting it go—\nFreeing is the very act of not freeing.\n\n“**Advance forward**” [前进] means that all worldly beings do not advance,\nOnly by retreating and secretly cultivating does one truly progress—\nRetreating is the way to advance.\n\nThe work, when truly attained, must first manifest affairs,\nYet when it naturally completes itself, it is not forced.\nThese words carry deep meaning—\nDo not read them as mere encouragement to rush blindly along!\n\nWhen the **Emperor** [进敕] bestowed the **Precious Forest Monastery** [宝林寺],\nThe **Elder** [长老] nodded and said: *“Even the **scaled and shelled beings** [鳞甲众生] worship the Buddha,\nYet why would humans not practice the **Dao/Way**?”\nHe sighed, lamenting that the monastery had only the name of **Precious Forest**,\nBut lacked its true essence.\n\nThe **monk-officials** [僧官] struck the **laymen** [道人] lightly,\nAs the world does—no cause for surprise.\nThe practitioner shattered the stone lions,\nTransmitting singularly and uniquely,\nStartling the crowd and bewildering them.\n*“It’s not convenient; you should move them away.”*\nThis can be seen as **perfect adaptability** [圆便],\nNot an invention of Old Monkey—\nIt follows the method of **stealing the body and rebirth** [夺舍投胎].\n*“If you don’t strike them, you’ll carry them in anyway.”*\nOnce the **stick and shout** [棒喝] has been given,\nThough the **monk** [和尚] may turn back,\nHe remains bound to the **Two Vehicles** [二乘].\n“**One bundle of poverty**” [一裹穷]—\nA self-made affliction,\nLonely cultivation and rigid sitting,\nA bundle of poverty within which no elixir forms,\nDishonoring the **Precious Dharma Jewel Monastery** [法宝珠林].\n\n“**Four-bed platform**” [四张床]—\nMaster and disciple sharing the same couch,\nThree families united,\nThe **Five Phases** [五行] gathered in harmony,\nOnly then does the **inexhaustible marvel** [妙赏不尽] appear.\n\nOn the **fifteenth day**, **pure yang** [纯阳] prevails,\nThe **Pre-Heaven Bagua** [先天八卦]—**Qian** [乾] Trigram—**three yang lines** [三阳爻].\nThe **thirteenth day**, **pure yin** [纯阴] prevails,\nThe **Kun** [坤] Trigram—**three yin lines** [□卦爻图略].\n\nThe **first three days** [初三日],\nKun conceives **one yang** [一阳] at **Geng** [庚] above,\nThe **Zhen** [震] Trigram—**two yin lines above, one yang line below** [上二阴爻，下一阳爻],\nThe **fire potency** [火候].\nThe **eighth day** [初八日],\nKun gives birth to **two yang** [二阳],\nThe **Dui** [兑] Trigram—**one yin line above, two yang lines below** [上一阴爻，下二阳爻],\nThe **front crescent** [前弦],\nThe **medicine and substance** [药物],\nThe **yang** [阳],\nThe **first eight** [一八].\n\nThe **fifteenth day** [十五日],\n**Pure yang** [纯阳],\nThe **Qian** [乾] Trigram—**three yang lines** [三阳爻].」\n\nOn the **sixteenth day**, **Qian** [乾] generates **one yin** at **Shen** [申] above,\nThe **Xun** [巽] Trigram—**two yang lines above, one yin line below** [上二阳爻，下一阴爻],\nThe **fire potency** [火候].\n\nOn the **twenty-third day**, **Qian** generates **two yin**,\nThe **Gen** [艮] Trigram—**one yang line above, two yin lines below** [上一阳爻，下二阴爻],\nThe **rear crescent** [后弦],\nThe **medicine and substance** [药物],\nThe **yin** [阴],\nThe **two eights** [二八].\n\nThe *Cántóng* [参同] states:\n*\"Kàn-Lí* [坎离] are the **two functions of Qian and Kun** [乾坤二用].\nTwo without fixed positions, circulating through the **six voids** [六虚].\nComing and going are not fixed, above and below have no constancy.\"\nThus, the Sage adopts these **two eights** [二八],\nAnd from them, **Kàn-Lí** [坎离] arise within—\nThis is called **\"embracing One to contain Three\"** [抱一函三].\n\nThe **secret verse** [诀] says:\n*\"Pre-Heaven **One Qi** [先天一气] transforms into **Qian-Kun** [乾坤],\n**Gen-Dui** [艮兑] revolve at the **Zhen-Xun** [震巽] gates.\nOnly the **six voids** [六虚] generate wondrous efficacy,\n**Kàn-Lí** [坎离] ebb and flow—**Dao** [道] holds supreme.\"\n\nThis is the **true utterance of the Moon’s brilliance** [月明之真言].\nWhen insight is fully awakened, it is as if **taking the scriptures from the Western Heaven** [西天取经].\n\nThe **Sand Monk** further points out:\n*\"Gold in water\"* [水中之金] is the **Five Phases converging** [五行攒簇],\nEntirely dependent on **Earth’s correspondence** [全凭土配],\nWith the **three families united** [三家同会],\nOnly then does the **Sun’s fullness** [日圆] appear.\n*\"Water and fire intermingling each have their fate\"* [水火相搀各有缘],\nEncompassing the **mysteries of *Jìjiè*** [既济], **starting the work** [下手], and **warm nourishment** [温养].\n\nThe **Eight Precepts** further clarifies the **subtlety of waxing and waning** [圆缺不全之妙],\nWhich is the **unfinished secret** [不全之秘要] of *\"The Moon emerges on the third day\"* [三日月出庚] in *Cántóng*,\nAnd the **true scripture of this very chapter** [本书本回真经].\nIt also indicates that after the **Moon’s fullness** [月圆],\nOne must fulfill **three thousand functions** [功满三千] to comply with **Heaven’s edict** [应天诏].\n\nEach disciple expounds upon the **essential nature of cultivation** [本质阐发修炼玄机],\nAnd thus the **entire oral transmission of the Golden Elixir** [金丹始终口诀] is fully revealed.\n\nYet fearing that one might **recite the *Heart Sutra* in vain** [空念《心经》],\nWhile failing to grasp the **true scripture of Mahayana** [大乘真经],\nThe **Pilgrim**—through the fault of reciting incorrectly—\nFails to awaken to the **true scripture’s essence** [真经未取晓悟],\nThis is called **\"splitting the side door to see the Moon’s intent\"** [劈傍门而见月明意].\n\n*\"When the Moon reaches the Heavenly Heart,\nThe Phoenix comes to the water’s surface,\nSuch pure delight—\nFew truly know its worth.\"*\n\nThe poet who composed this—\nDid he

Sovereign** [心君] itself.\nWhen the **Sovereign’s fire rages unchecked** [君火亢炎],\nOnly **water can temper it** [非水不济].\nThe **complete truth arrives from the south** [南来全真],\nPraying for rain to nourish the land,\nAnd after long drought, rain falls—\n**Water and Fire in Harmony** [水火既济],\nIllustrating **Qian-Kun’s mutual response** [乾坤交感],\nWhere **Qian transforms into Kàn** [乾变为坎],\nAnd **Kun transforms into Lí** [坤变为离].\n\nWithin **Lí**, the **void yin** [虚阴]—\n**one yang line above and below, one yin line in the center** [上下各一阳爻，中一阴爻]—\nMust be filled by the **true yang of Kàn** [坎中之真阳],\nOnly then is the **complete Qian essence** [乾体之真] restored.\n\nIf one **mistakes the false forms of the body’s heart and kidney** [一身心肾之假象],\nAnd **clings to internal water-fire exchange as truth** [执水火内交为真],\nThis is **erroneously grasping the meaning of *\"acquiring a companion in the southwest\"** [西南得朋之义].\n\nIt is like the **true-west king** [正西国王],\nWho **pledges brotherhood with the complete truth from Zhōunán Mountain** [结拜锺南山祈雨之全真],\nSharing bed and board,\n**Seizing the true as false** [假夺其真],\nWhile the **true is lost** [真者反陷].\n\n**Kàn** [坎] is, in Pre-Heaven, the **true west** [本正西];\n**Lí** [离] is, in Pre-Heaven, the **true east** [本正东].\nThe **true spirit of Lí** [离中真灵] resides in the west,\nThus the **true master of Kàn** [坎中之真主]\nIs also the **true master of Lí** [离中之真主]—\nThey must not be **divided** [不得而二视之].\n\n**Kàn** symbolizes a **well** [井].\nThe **Kàn Hexagram** [坎卦]—\n**one yin line above and below, one yang line in the center** [上下各一阴爻，中一阳爻]—\nIts **upper and lower lines** [上下二爻] represent the **eight angles of the four directions** [八角四方],\nClear as **jade-like glass** [透如琉璃],\nHence it is said:\n*\"Eight-cornered glass well\"* [八角琉璃井边].\n*\"Suddenly, ten thousand rays of golden light\"* [忽起万道金光]—\nThis is the **true gold within Kàn** [坎中之一真金].\nOne can generate ten thousand—\nHence the **ten thousand rays** [有万道].\n*\"Pushed into the well’s depths,\nCovering the well’s mouth,\nTransplanting a banana tree above,\nTransformed into my likeness,\nSeizing the realm and territory.\"*\n\nThis allegorizes those who **mistakenly identify heart and kidney as Kàn-Lí** [谬认心肾为坎离],\n**Sealing the tail-end orifice in vain** [空闭尾闾之穴],\nWhile **inverting the true essence** [逆陷其真];\n**Usurping the Sovereign’s *Tài* [泰]**\nAnd **stealing its false pretenses** [窃行其假].\n\n「When they speak of *\"the City Deity\"* [都城隍], *\"the Dragon King of the Sea\"* [海龙王], *\"the Judge of the Eastern Prison\"* [东狱阎君], *\"the wine gathering\"* [会酒], *\"kinsmen and friends\"* [亲友], *\"brothers\"* [弟兄], all these phrases depict their alignment with the **yin spirits** [阴神], sharing **qi** [气] in harmony, making clear that all four great elements [四大] within their being belong to **yin** [阴].\n\nThis is the discourse of the **Ghost King** [鬼王] paying homage and distinguishing between **evil and righteous** [邪正]. It reveals the **Prince of the Original Palace** [本宫太子], who is the **true yang’s direct lineage** [真阳之嫡脉], the **root of the savior** [救主之根裔]. Yet, he must seek guidance from the place where he was born from his mother [伊母生身之处], tracing the clues to fulfill his mission. If the mother and child are severed [母子隔绝], the child cannot fully express filial devotion or sincere communication [尽孝通诚], nor repay the mother’s kindness nor rescue the father from his predicament [报母恩而拯父难]. This illustrates the loss of **yin-yang’s primal order** [阴阳失其宗位], for how could one’s **true nature** [天性] remain uncorrupted?\n\n*\"Leaving behind a white jade* [白玉珪]*\"—*\nThe **bi** [珪] symbolizes **sincerity** [信], and two **earthly elements** [二土] complement each other, signifying the **harmonious union of husband and wife** [夫妻合意同心], not mere outward pretense [外假模样] or inner emptiness [内无实用] that could achieve this. Hence it is said:\n*\"I shall entrust a dream to the Original Palace,\nInstructing them that mother and child should unite in harmony,\nSo that you, master and disciple, may align in sincerity.\"*\n\nThis entire ghostly tale [鬼话] is but the **divine revelation** [天机].\nWhen **Tripitaka** [三藏] stumbled and awoke in shock [忽绊一跌惊醒], he had just realized the truth within the dream [梦中方觉].\nThe **Traveler** [行者] declared:\n*\"Master, dreams arise from thoughts.\nA heart filled with dreams, like old disciple’s single true thought,\nIs solely to behold the Buddha—\nNo dream shall ever reach me.\"*\n\nHe spoke of dreams as **illusions of the unenlightened** [蒙昧不真], for the **true person** [真人] knows no dreams. Yet **Tripitaka** is a true person—how then does he dream?\n\nIn ancient times, **Xinxie** [心斋] visited **Lord Yangming** [阳明公], and sat as a guest. When asked:\n*\"If the true person knows no dreams, why did Confucius dream of Master Zhou?\"*\n**Lord Yangming** replied:\n*\"This is the very essence of a true dream.\"* [梦真]\nXinxie heard this in astonishment [愕然], then knelt and bowed, facing north [逐下拜，执北面礼].\n\nThe dreams **Tripitaka** experienced came from the **lunar realm** [论月中]. *\"Ghost\"* [鬼] and *\"cloud\"* [云] are but the **soul of the moon** [月魂]. This is the **true essence of the lunar dream** [梦月中之真], not a false one. Hence, the Traveler saw within the moonlight a **white jade bi** [白玉珪] indeed, and said:\n*\"This matter is true.\"*\n\nYet many doubt this, unwilling to act decisively. The Traveler took full responsibility, saying:\n*\"All lies with old disciple.\nJust follow my lead, and it shall be done.\"*\n\nThis is the **Buddha’s promise** [佛祖所云]—*\"I now guarantee your success,\nAnd this extraordinary affair shall be fulfilled.\"* [我今为汝保任，成此希有之事]\n\nThe brilliance of decisive action lies in **first binding the infant** [先结婴儿].\nWhy is binding the infant not beyond the **Kàn-Lí* [坎离] *fulfilled* [既济] *Dao/Way* [道]?\nHe transformed the **red lacquered box** [红金漆匣], placing the **bi** [白玉珪] within—\nTwo **earthly elements** [二土] in harmony,\nThis is to summon the infant to witness the **secret teachings** [秘法].\n\nMarvelous indeed!\n*\"The Great Sage transformed into a two-inch-long novice monk,\nHiding within the box\"*—\nA **strange transformation** [奇变] into its **complement** [偶], a **great into small** [大变小],\nThe **primordial and postnatal** [先天后天] have no fixed form—\nWith or without substance, they are ever-shifting in appearance [无定体，有质无质无常形].\n*\"This treasure within the box\nCan foresee the past and future of one thousand five hundred years.\"* [能知一千五百年过去未来之事]\nIs it not the **refined essence of the three-five* [三五] *cycle* [之精灵] *?* [耶]」\n\n「The name **\"Establish the Emperor’s Treasure\"** [立帝货] is given,\nCapable of founding the great principle of the world,\nYet causing the Emperor to emerge from **Zhèn** [震].\nIt transmutes the **treasure** [宝贝] into a **true person** [真人]—\nNot the **I, Zhou, Huò, or Gé** [伊、周、霍、葛] of old!\n\nThe **Great Sage** [大圣] transformed into a **white hare** [白兔儿],\nAs the **moon’s spirit** [月魂], the **refined essence of true yang within yin** [阴中真阳之精].\nWithout this essence, one could not **bind the infant** [结婴].\nThere are **unfathomable yin-yang transformations** [阴阳不测],\nMarvels of **divine transcendence and alchemical change** [出神入化之妙],\nThus the **Crown Prince** [太子] shot an arrow at the white hare,\nAnd the **Great Sage** [大圣] dove into the **red box** [红匣].\n\nWhen **yin moves**, it becomes **yang**;\nWhen **yang stirs**, it turns to **yin**—\nThis is what is meant by **divine transformation** [神化].\n\nThe **Tripitaka Master** [三藏] spoke of **seeking scriptures in the Eastern Lands and offering treasures** [东土求经进宝],\nThe Crown Prince replied: *\"The Eastern Lands are indeed exhausted beyond measure!\"* [东土其穷无比。]\nWhy so? Though **Golden Master** [金公] was born in the East,\nHe was truly **a parasitic guest of the West** [实寄生于西].\nThe West is rich, the East is poor—\nThis is his natural state.\nOne must **clearly discern** [认得],\nTo summon him without letting him **drift away to other lands** [流落他乡],\nOnly then can **mother and child reunite** [母子相见],\nAnd the **child repay the father’s kindness** [子报父恩].\n\nThus the **Tripitaka Master** [唐僧] said:\n*\"You have not avenged your father’s wrongs—\nIn vain you claim to be human!\"* [你的父冤未报枉为人！]\n\nThe **Disciple** [行者] leapt from the box,\nFrom a **three-foot-tall child** [三尺之童] to full growth,\nAll in an instant.\nPast, present, and future,\nAncient and modern—\nAll beings, all things are thus.\nBy understanding the **principle** [理], one knows them all—\nWhy bother with endless calculations?\n\nBut if one can **recognize** [识得] the **lonely one** [称孤者] in the present,\nThen **true insight** [真知] into the **ten thousand ages** [千万年] will be **burningly clear** [灼见],\nAnd **fully comprehended without remainder** [已了彻无遗矣].\n\nFor the **human form** [人身] arises from the **interaction of Heaven and Earth** [乾坤交感],\nYet the **true father of one’s birth** [生身之真父] has already **fallen into the abyss** [失陷于坎].\nThe present body is but a **pure yin phantasm** [纯阴之假体].\nAll mistake it for reality—\nThey are all in a **dream** [梦中].\nThe Disciple could not help but **speak plainly and directly** [正色直指]:\n*\"The one who departed as the wind spirit—\nThat is your **true father of birth** [生身之老父];\nThe one now seated—\nThat is the **fully authentic** [全真] one who **prays for rain** [祈雨].\"*\n\nHow **sharp and decisive** [斩绝明快]!\nYet alas—\nThe **bewildered** [迷人] do not believe,\nInstead, they **mistake the one presenting the white jade** [白玉珪] *as*\nThe **deceiver of my treasure** [骗我宝贝之人]!\n\nBeyond the **name** [名], there is another **name** [名];\nBeyond the **body** [身], there is another **body** [身].\n*\"The white hare pierced by the arrow—\nThat is **Old Monkey** [老孙].\"\n*\nIf one recognizes the **white jade rabbit** [白玉珪] and believes in it without doubt,\nThen one may **recite** [念] the **enactment of filial gratitude** [养育恩] and **avenge the wrongs done to one’s parents** [替亲报仇].\n\nThe **Immortal Master** [仙师] in this passage\nReveals the **Dao/Way’s profound mysteries** [道妙] line by line from the **true parents of one’s birth** [生身父母],\nHence the saying:\n*\"Ask your **country’s mother, the queen** [国母娘娘] a single word—\nSee how their **husband-wife affection** [夫妻恩爱] fares!\nJust this,\nAnd you shall know the **true from the false** [真假].*\n*\nThis is **whispered counsel** [悄语], **gentle admonition** [低言],\nA **secret safeguard of one’s life** [密保性命之事],\nTruly **urgent and earnest** [叮咛切嘱]!\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Eight** [第三十八回]\n*\"The Infant Disciple Questions the Mother, Discerning Right from Wrong\"* [婴儿问母知邪正]\n*\"Gold and Wood Merge with the Mystic, Revealing False

**attained the assembly of the Thus-Come One** [如来会上人].’\n*\nIt states that if one knows the **source of birth’s cause** [受生因] from whence it comes,\nThen one knows the **method of immortality** [不死之方] is also **constructed** [造] therefrom,\nIs it not **transcendent and supremely awakened** [超然大觉]?\nOne who has **attained the assembly of the Thus-Come One** [如来会上人]!\n\n**Confucius** [宣圣] said:\n*\"How can one know **death** [死] if one does not know **birth** [生]?\nOnly by knowing **birth** [生] does one then know **death** [死].\"*\n\n**Han Yang True Person** [汉阳真人] said:\n*\"One must take the **corpse** [死尸] as the **living body** [生尸],\nDo not **cling to the label of ‘birth’** [生门] and **deny the label of ‘death’** [死门].\"*\n\n**Master Cheng** [程子] said:\n*\"If one can **trace the origins** [原始],\nAnd **understand the principles of birth** [知得生理],\nThen one can **grasp the end** [要终],\nAnd **know the principles of death** [知得死理].*\n*\nAll speak of this same **meaning** [义].\n\nThe mind, when made pure and still,\nSees the Buddha in the dust of the world—\nTen directions gaze upon the descending **Mighty One**.\n\nThis is the **Way** of keeping the heart clean while the body remains in the world;\nThe Buddha is vast within the dust, not confined to the Western Paradise.\n\nThe body, undivided in self and other, reveals the **mysterious principle**—\nThis **Mighty One** descends from the void, untouched by names and forms.\n\nAs the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* states:\n*\"Bodhisattvas belong to sentient beings;\nWithout sentient beings, all bodhisattvas would never attain supreme awakening.\"*\nThis is the meaning of the Buddha in the dust, seen by all ten directions.\n\n*\"To know the true master of today,\nOne must inquire of the mother who bore you in years past.\"*\nThis speaks of cultivating the **elixir** today, yet to grasp its true mystery,\nOne must delve into the origin of the mother who gave birth to you,\nOnly then will the truth be clearly understood.\n\nAs the *Awakening to Reality* states:\n*\"Urge you to seek the source of your birth-body,\nReturning to the origin is the **Pharmaceutical King**.\"*\n\n*\"There is another worldly realm unseen by the world,\nEach step a new beginning, each stride anew.\"*\nThis **teaching**, transmitted outside scripture, is rarely known by the world.\nIf one knows it and walks this path,\nEach step blooms with fresh flowers—\nLotus after lotus unfolds.\n\nAs **Zhongyang True Person** said:\n*\"If you wish to leave secrets in the world,\nFew are the true listeners.\"*\n\nAnd the **Dan Jing** states:\n*\"One grain advanced, one grain refined—\nGolden lotuses bloom, yet none recognize them.\"*\n\nThe verses here use symbols to reveal meaning—\nWhat matters is transcending symbols to grasp the **meaning**,\nAnd forgetting words to hold the **meaning**.\n\nThe tale of the **Princess**’ dream:\n*\"Remembering half, forgetting half,\"*\nFor husband and wife reuniting are half true, half false—\nHow much more so in the realm of dream-death?\n\nThe forgotten half conceals a hidden meaning,\nOnly revealed later through the **Pilgrim’s** and **Eight Rules’** exploration of **metal and wood** mysteries,\nWhere truth and falsehood are discerned.\n\nThe **Prince** asks:\n*\"Mother, how deep was the love between husband and wife in the palace?\"*\nThe **Princess** replies:\n*\"This matter remains unclear even in the underworld.\"*\n\n*\"Speaking of cold and warmth so starkly distinct,\nWith emotional ties severed—\nOne may perceive that true love is the **orthodox (正)**,\nWhile separation is the **heterodox (邪)**.\n\nThis is entirely an empty illusion of **husband and wife**,\nYet falsely clings to lineage as a son—\n**Suppressing the natural flow of Dao (天机)**,\n**Defying the true nature of existence (真性)**—\nWhat is more **heterodox** than this?\n\nIf one wishes to **correct the orthodox** and **remove the heterodox**,\nThey must first make **husband and wife, mother and child** believe in unity—\nOnly then can the **previous life** be saved,\nPreventing its **degeneration and obscurity (沉沦埋没)**.\n\nThe **Princess** recognizes **White Jade Tablet (白玉珪)**,\n**Unites it with the night’s dream (合诸夜梦)**,\nAnd entrusts her son to **urgently invite the Holy Monk (圣僧)**,\nTo **discern the orthodox and heterodox (辨明邪正)**,\nAnd repay his **filial virtue (父恩)**.\n\n**Combining one tablet and two soils (总一圭二土)**,\n**Uniting meaning and heart (会意联心)**,\nFrom **death**, seeking **life (从死中求活)**—\nWithin **calamity**, **virtue emerges (害里生恩)**.\n\nAs in the *Awakening to Truth Chapter (《悟真篇》)*:\n*\"If one meets the killing intent and clarifies its reversals (若会杀机明反覆),\nOnly then does one know that within calamity, virtue arises (始知害里却生恩).\"*\n\nBut—\n*\"To seek the Heavenly treasure (欲求天上宝),\nOne must use worldly wealth (须用世间财).\"*\n\nOne must first **gather the Dao’s wealth (聚法财)**,\nTo **assist the practice of the Way (助道用)**.\n\n**Sun Wukong (行者)** gathers a **wild wind of beasts (聚兽阴风)**,\nAnd the **beasts of boundless measure (野兽)** respond in chorus,\nWith **great blessings (洪福)**,\nSinging triumphantly as they return to the city—\nThis is the meaning.\n\nYet, those who practice this are as **numerous as cow’s hair (如牛毛)**,\nWhile those who succeed are as **rare as rabbit’s horns (如兔角)**,\nAll because **truth and falsehood cannot be clearly discerned (真假未能确见)**.\n\nThe **discrimination between truth and falsehood (真假之辨)** lies in the distinction between **solitary cultivation (孤修)** and **mutual aid in practice (共济)**:\n**Solitary cultivation** is **false** and difficult to fulfill,\nWhile **mutual aid** is **true** and easily achieved.\n\nIf one does not **delve deeply with utmost care (精心穷究)**,\nNor **penetrate the profound mysteries (参透玄机)**,\nThen they will **mistake the false for true**,\nOr **mistake the true for false**—\n**Erroneously acting**, they will never see the **true treasure (真宝)**,\nHow then can they **revive the dead and return to life (起死回生)**,\nOr **remove the heterodox and restore the orthodox (除邪返正)**?\n\nThus, **Sun Wukong (行者)** has a matter in mind,\nAnd **cannot sleep (睡不着)**—\nAfter **consulting with his master (与师父计较)** and devising a plan,\nHe **delves into profound mysteries (深研几)**,\nRevealing the **secret teachings of master and disciple (师徒传道之密旨)**.\n\n**Sun Wukong** arrives at **Hui Gui’s (八戒) bedside** and calls for the **precious item (宝贝)**,\nSaying, *\"Let’s go steal it together.\"*\n**Hui Gui** replies, *\"I’ll go if it’s thievery.\"*\n**Sun Wukong** says, *\"Once we obtain the treasure,\nI’ll buy it immediately.\"*\n**Hui Gui** says, *\"Then give the treasure to you.\"*\nBoth are **overjoyed (满心欢喜)**,\nAnd on **clouds of boundless joy (纵祥云)**,\nThey **directly head to the banyan tree’s base and the well’s edge (径到芭蕉树下井边)**.\n\nThis is where **the metal father and wooden mother unite in meaning and heart (金公木母合意同心)**,\n**Wood fully merges with metal (全木交并)**,\n**Husband leads, wife follows (夫唱妇随)**,\n**Plundering the Dao’s profound mysteries (窃天地之玄机)**,\nAnd **stealing the vital breath of life from the killing intent (盗杀中之生气)**.\n\nThose who **cultivate the elixir (修丹志士)**,\nIf they can **penetrate this profound truth (能于此处参透真妙)**,\nWill have **the true treasure to act upon (真宝下手处)**—\nAs said in *\"In the underworld’s gathering, none recognize it,\nOnly the banyan tree offers late-night contemplation (阎阳会上无人识，只与芭蕉作晚参).\"*\n\n**Hui Gui** descends into the well,\nAnd suddenly sees the **Crystal Palace (水晶宫)**,\nAsking the **Dragon King (龙王)** for the **precious item (宝贝)**—\nThis is the **symbol of filling the abyss (坎填离)**.\n\nThe **Dragon King** leads **Hui Gui** to the **Black Rooster King’s corpse (乌鸡王尸)**,\nPointing it out as the **precious item (宝贝)**,\nAnd saying, *\"**Sun Wukong** has the intention of **reviving the dead and returning life (起死回生)**,\nRely on you—**whatever treasure he seeks, he will obtain (要甚么宝贝都有)**.\"*\n\nThis **illustrates the elixir’s return and the reversal of yin and yang (寓丹道返还之妙，阴阳颠倒之用)**.\nIf one can **transform the killing intent into life-giving breath (转生杀之机)**,\nAnd **practice it in reverse (逆而修之)**,\nThen **calamity turns to fortune (灾中变福)**,\nAnd **within harm, virtue arises (害里生恩)**—\nAs said: *\"**The Five Phases (五行)** in their natural order are **hellish fire pits (法界火坑)**;\n**Reversed practice (正行颠倒)** yields **seven treasures of the earth (大地七宝)**.\"*\n\n**Hui Gui** **touches the corpse with one hand (一把摸着)**,\nYet **refuses to carry it out (不肯驼出)**.\n**Sun Wukong** says, *\"That is the **precious item (宝贝)**—\nWhy not carry it up?\"*\n\n**Hui Gui** **discerns the single stroke in the abyss (坎中之一画)** as **the essence of death (死质)** and not the **precious item (宝贝)**,\nWhile **Sun Wukong** **discerns the true essence within the abyss (坎中之真主)** as **vital breath of life (生气)** and thus the **precious item (宝贝)**—\nThis is the **profound mystery of metal and wood in harmony (正金木相参之玄妙)**.\n\n**Hui Gui** carries the **corpse back to the Monastery of Precious Treasures (宝林寺)**,\nAnd says, *\"My elder brother told me—\nHe can **revive the dead and return life (救得活)**.\"*\n\nWas **Sun Wukong** truly **without intent (无意)**,\nYet **mocking him to take revenge (捉弄他报仇)**?\n\n**The Great Sage (大圣)** has the intention of **reviving the dead and returning life**,\nAnd the **Dragon King** had already spoken of it—\nIt is merely **borrowing Hui Gui’s actions (借八戒)** to **point out that the world truly has such elixirs (指世间实有起死回生之药)**,\nUrging them to **seek it urgently (宜急早寻求)**.\n\nIf the **dead can be revived (死者尚可生)**,\nWhy fear that the **living cannot transcend mortality (生者不可仙)**?\nThis is **implicitly stated (隐然言表)**.\n\nAh! (吁！)\"\n\nThe **imperial cap and robes** cannot halt decay—\nEmperors and tyrants alike turn to dust.\n\nIf one does not refine the **Golden Elixir (金丹)**,\nOne’s life is but a ghost’s hollow abode.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine**\n*A Single Grain of Elixir Obtained from Heaven*\n*Three Years Later, the Old Master Revives in the World*\n\n**Treasured Son** said: *\"Zhuangyang True Person declared:*\n*'Swallowing a single grain of elixir into the belly,*\n*Only then does one know one’s life was originally from Heaven.'*\nThis speaks of the elixir being obtained from the **Yang world (阳世间)**,*\nThat life is self-made, not granted by Heaven.*\n\nYet the outline states *'obtained from Heaven (天上得)'*—\nIs this not too distant, raising doubts in people’s minds?\n\nBut when it speaks of *'Heaven (天上)'*, it means **Heaven within humanity (人中之天)**,*\nNot Heaven above (天上之天).\n\n**Hui Gui** said, *\"Master, do not believe him.*\nHe originally said one need not pass through the **Underworld (阴司)**—\nIn the **Yang world (阳世间)**, a physician can revive him.\"*\n\n**The Great Sage** said, *\"Let the Old Monkey try it in the Yang world.\"*\n*\"I shall now seek the **Venerable Laozi (太上老君)***\nTo beg for a grain of **Nine-Turn Reincarnation Elixir (九转还魂丹)**—\nI shall certainly revive him!\"*\n\nFor **Laozi’s wondrous Dao** exists within the **Yang world**,\nAnd can be attained by all who seek it earnestly—\nIt is not in Heaven above, only waiting for those who find it.\n\n**Lu Zu** said:\n*\"I hear people say they all seek me,*\n*Yet they tread the world’s edges—no one truly finds me!\"*\n\nThe **Immortal’s heart to save the world** surpasses that of mortals seeking salvation.\nYet mortals lack the **virtue and devotion** to receive salvation,\nRefusing to **sincerely believe and hold firm in their hearts**,\nRejecting transformation, passing by **face-to-face with the True Ones**—\nHow can one force them to accept salvation?\nAll must await death before it is too late.\n\nSpeaking of this, one can only weep deeply!\n\n**Hui Gui** guards the corpse and weeps—\n*Is this the sorrow of **Bian Que’s lament (卞璞)**?*\n*Or the pity of **Chu Fu’s grief (楚覆)**?*\n*Or the mourning of **Chu Lin’s despair (锄麟)**?*\n*Or the lament of **the collapsing city (崩城)**?*\n*Or the wail of **Changsha’s grief (长沙)**?*\n\n*Man’s life not yet ended, yet his heart already lost—*\n*Oh, Heaven!*\nWithin a single cry, **yellow paths and black roads** intertwine,\nEncompassing boundless suffering in the world’s salvation!\n\nWhen the sorrow reaches its peak, those who hear shall surely weep—\nHow much more shall the **Elder’s heart ache with tears!**\n\n**The Great Sage** arrives at **Li Hentian (离恨天)**, **Duosuo Palace (兜率宫)**.\n**Laozi** instructs: *\"The boys who guard the elixir,*\n*Be cautious—thieves come to steal again!\"*\n\nWhen **The Great Sage** borrows the elixir and refuses to give it,\nHe turns to leave, but **Laozi** chases after him.\nFor the **Golden Elixir** is a **stolen treasure of transformation**—\nIts presence or absence depends not on **Laozi’s stinginess**.\nFearful of theft, he must give it,\nYet giving it is the same as stealing—\nThe thief’s cunning is beyond all mortals’ sight or knowledge.\n\n**The Great Sage** calls, *\"Sha Monk, fetch water.\"*\n**Hu Po** stirs the mixture in her voice.\n\nHe spits out the **Golden Elixir** into the corpse’s belly.\n**Tripitaka** says, *\"If one gains a human’s breath of life, it will suffice.\"*\n**The Great Sage** exhales a **\"huff\"** of pure **qi** into the throat—\n*\"A loud sound—then the king’s **qi gathered, his spirit returned**.\"*\n\nFor the **Returning Elixir** has no form—\nWithout a breath of pure **qi**, it remains unseen.\n*\"Qi gathered, spirit returned\"*—\nThis is when **metal returns to its original nature (金来归性初)**,\nOnly then can it be called **Returning Elixir**,\nAnd the old king returns to his kingdom.\n\nThe **Water-Clothed Emperor** emerges from the **Kan Palace (坎宫)**—\nMany are astonished, so **The Great Sage** clarifies:\n*\"This is the **Black Cock King (乌鸡国王)**, your true master!\"*\nHe instructs the king to don **Daoist robes**,\nWilling to ascend to the **Western Heaven**—\nYet why does **The Great Sage** then say,\n*\"You need not go to the Western Heaven—\nYou shall remain your emperor!\"*\n\nFor a ruler who attains the **Dao in office** can\nPractice the **Way of Yao and Shun (尧舜之道)**,\nTransform the world, accumulate **virtue and deeds**,\nPassing them to future ages,\nSaving countless lost souls eternally—\nThis surpasses **Wei Fu’s merit and deeds a thousandfold**—\nWhy seek the **Western Heaven** again?\n\nThis passage’s poem reveals what *Awakening to Reality (悟真)* did not,\nAnd transmits what the **scriptures** did not—\nYet readers dismiss it as idle chatter,\nEquating **Heaven’s secrets and sacred instructions** with vulgar speech,\nFor they lack true guidance from a true master.\n\nAs the opening line states:\n*\"In the West, the secret is found—seek the True One.\"*\nIf one has not obtained the secret,\nEven if a true treasure is before them,\nHow can they truly perceive it?\n\nNext:\n*\"Metal and water harmonized—now refine the spirit.\"*\n**Metal (金)** is the **Public (公)**, **Wood (木)** is the **Mother (母)**—\nTheir union forms the **elixir’s head**—\nThis is the shared meaning across countless scriptures.\n\nIf one has not obtained the secret,\nThey may mistakenly take *\"harmonized\"* as **alchemical union with a woman (闺丹御女之术)**,\nFalling into heresy—\nHow then can they attain **Suchness (真如)**?\n\n*\"The elixir’s mother bears only confused dreams,\"*\nMeaning the **Ghost King’s dream**—\nHalf of it is not truly remembered.\n\nYet the elixir truly has a **Mother**,\nAnd the Mother truly bears **confusion**—\nYet she conceals this mystery from her.\n\nAs it says:\n*\"The infant forever laments his parasitic body,\"*\nMeaning the **Quanzhen sect’s usurpation**—\nThe **Crown Prince** is the **parasite**,\nIllustrating that the **Great Dao** has an **infant**—\nYet it is not empty.\n\nYet the infant truly has no form,\nAnd the infant truly has a **parasitic body**—\nThis is the elixir’s profound mystery.\n\nAs it states:\n*\"One must seek the original master at the well’s bottom,\"*\nMeaning **Hui Gui’s descent into the well** and return with the **Ghost King**—\nIllustrating **filling the **Kan (坎)** with **Li (离)**.*\n\nYet the **original master at the well’s bottom** has no form—\nAnd the original master truly has a form—\nOnly those who seek shall find it.\nAnd only by seeking through others can the elixir be perfected.\n\nAs it says:\n*\"One must also pay homage to Laozi in Heaven,\"*\nMeaning **The Great Sage’s** borrowing of the **Returning Elixir** from **Laozi**—\nThis implies that **elixir refinement must follow Laozi’s teachings.**\n\n「Yet the **Laozi** is not in the **Heaven of Heaven (天之天)**, but in the **Heaven of Man (人之天)**.\n*\"Still one must pay homage\"*—\nThis means bowing in reverence and returning,\nSeeking from the **Heavens (天)**, then one may obtain the elixir.\n\nIt concludes with:\n*\"Awakening to the emptiness of form and returning to one’s true nature,*\n*Truly the **Buddha** saves those with karmic ties.*\nMeaning, after attaining the elixir,\nOne may perceive the nature and illuminate the mind,\nRealizing **form is emptiness**, emptiness is form,\nReturning to one’s original nature as void,\nThen the **Buddha** may save those with karmic ties—\nSeeing the **Buddha** is the **Immortal Sage**, the **Immortal Sage** is the **Buddha**.\n\nThose with a predestined **Immortal Sage** connection,\nWho can penetrate this verse,\nThe **alchemical elixir’s** profound secrets are complete—\nEven **shelves of sacred scriptures** are no longer needed.\n\nThe **Master and Disciple** summon the **King’s** deposition,\nThe **Demon King** vanishes at the sight of the sky—\nAll recognize their **former master**,\nFor *\"the true essence now resides in the Yellow Gold Hall (黄金室),*\n*a single spark of wisdom forever departs not\"*—\nThis is so.\n\nThe **liberation** comes not from the **Underworld (阴司), the Heavens (天), future lives (来生), or other realms (异世),**\nBut from one’s own **self (本身)** and the **manifest world (阳世)**.\n\nIn the following text, the **Demon King** is defeated—\nIf he were to **transform his guise** and still appear as the **King’s** form,\nWould one not be unable to distinguish him?\n\nYet how does he change to resemble **San Zang (三藏)**,\nSo that the **Tight-Fitting Spell (紧箍咒)** can reveal him?\n\nThe **Immortal Sage** speaks metaphorically of the **original master’s** true and false nature being fixed,\nYet the **Master’s** transmitted secrets may vary.\n\nIf one encounters two **Masters**,\nAnd cannot discern who is true and who is false,\nUnable to distinguish and mistakenly takes the wrong one as genuine—\nThis would harm the true one.\n\nThus, the **verification** of the **living principle (活儿)** must be precise—\nOnly then is it the **true secret transmission**;\nIf one **blusters without verification**, it is false teaching.\n\n**Sun Wukong** leaps higher,\nSeeking **elevated insight** and **direct contact** with the **true principle**.\n\n**Manjusri** holds the **Mirror of Demon Illumination (照妖镜)**,\nFixing the **Green Lion’s** demonic form—\n*\"By the **Buddha’s** decree, to avenge the grudge of the water calamity,\"*\nMeaning those who have suffered harm all mistakenly recognize their own **karmic sins (孽)** as fabricated.\n\n*\"This is a castrated lion—*\n*It cannot defile purity.\"*\nThis refers to those who practice **solitude in the **Dharma of Emptiness (空门)****.\n\nThe **lion** is the **Master**.\nThe **Green Lion** is the **pretender Master**—\nA **false Master** masquerading as the **true Master**,\nHow demonic! How tragic!\n\nYet in this world, there are many **castrated lions**—\nHow I wish **Manjusri Bodhisattva** would swiftly bring the **Mirror of Demon Illumination** to seize and remove them!\n\nThe **Mirror of Demon Illumination** is the **discriminative wisdom** that perceives others.\n\n---\n\n**The Forty-First Chapter: The Infant’s Play Disturbs the Zen Mind**\n**The Monkey’s and Horse’s Knives Clash with the Wooden Mother’s Void**\n\n**The Sage’s Disciple** says:\nThese three verses together reveal that,\nAfter attaining the elixir,\nOne must fully perceive the nature and illuminate the mind,\nAscend to **highest clarity (上彻)** and descend to **lowest tranquility (下梧)**,\nSweep away the **six desires (六欲)**,\nPractice **meditation, insight, and wisdom (禅定慧)**,\nFace the wall in **non-action (无为)**,\nAnd approach **transformation into the divine (神化)**.\n\nFirst, it recounts **Sun Wukong** calling the **Daoist** to don his original attire,\nHolding the **white jade staff (白玉珪)**,\nAscending the hall to proclaim himself **sovereign**—\nThis is the **Great Concealment (大隐)** not hindering residence in the court,\nAs the **wind stirs the world (风动天下)**,\nAnd blessings extend to all people.\n\nThen he declares:\n*\"I still act as my own **monk (和尚)**,\nAnd go to cultivate **meritorious deeds (功德)**.\"*\n\nThis means that **laymen who attain the elixir (韦布之士)**,\nIf **greed, anger, and delusion (贪、嗔、痴)** remain unchecked,\nAnd their **practices and virtues (功行)** are incomplete—\nThis is **cultivating life, not nature (修命不修性)**,\nAlso a **stubborn Immortal Sage** stuck in **deluded paths (滞迹)**,\nHard to transcend the **Three Realms (三界)**.\n\nAs the **Song of the Divine Elixir (敲爻歌)** states:\n*\"Only cultivating the **Master’s** nature, not the elixir,*\n*The endless kalpas turn in vain—one never enters the **Sage’s** path.*\n*Clinging to the **Dharma of Life (命宗)**,*\n*Lost in the **Master’s** nature—*\n*Like a mirror without reflection,*\n*One’s face has no fixed image.*\n*Lifespan equal to Heaven and Earth,*\n*A foolish man with no mastery,*\n*Yet holds wealth like a thief without true ownership.\"*\n\nThe **Immortal Sage** intentionally unleashes the **evil fire (邪火)** of **Hong Haier (红孩儿)** and the **filthy water (孽水)** of **Hei Shui Niao (黑水鼍)**,\nTo teach one to awaken to **true understanding**.\n\n**Huiyan Sage**’s poem says:\n*\"There is a thing that precedes Heaven and Earth,*\n*Formless, originally still and boundless.*\n*It can be the master of all phenomena,*\n*Yet does not wither with the four seasons.\"*\n\nThe **Dharma of Life (命)** is the **true nature (性)**.\n**Nature** has **good, none evil**,\nYet the **mind** cannot be without **partiality and completeness**—\nThis is the **post-heavenal qi’s** purity and turbidity.\n\nThus, to **fulfill nature (尽性)**, nothing surpasses **dying to the mind (死心)**;\n**Dying to the mind** means **dying to the mind that harms nature**.\nTo **die to the mind**, nothing surpasses **forgetting the contrivances (忘机)**;\n**Forgetting contrivances** means **forgetting what disturbs the mind**.\nTo **forget contrivances**, nothing surpasses **nurturing qi (养气)**;\n**Nurturing qi** means **nurturing the qi that moves the mind**.\n\n**Hong Haier (红孩儿)** is the **innocent child’s heart**.\nThe **heart** is the **fire repository (火藏)**,\nWith **yang quality** and **yin nature**,\nExternally bright, internally dark.\nWhen **flame ascends (炎上)**, anger surges to the heavens;\nWhen **first ignited (始燃)**, the **latent contrivance (伏机)** lies within.\n\n*\"Gathering fire-qi, it soars straight to the ninth sky,\"*\nThis is **anger**.\n*\"Naked body, no clothing, dangling from the tree’s tip,\"*\nThis is the **latent contrivance**.\nIts **sudden rise and fall, ever-changing and unpredictable**,\nHolds the **deceitful mind (昧心)** that plays with **true principle (正)**,\nDesiring to **overthrow the enlightened wisdom (明眼)** that guards the **true principle**—\nThis is the **true contrivance**.\n\nThe phrase *\"wasting one’s mental efforts\"* is the **demon’s** confession.\n\nThe three **disciples** each grasp their weapons,\nAs if ready to strike—\nThe **Elder** rages at the **monkey’s** demonic tricks,\nAnd in fury **seizes the horse** to scold.\n\nAll **portray** the **stimulated mind** in **anger**,\nDisturbing the **Zen mind**.\n\n*\"Gully of the withered tree,\"*\nWood dried, fire **flares**—\nTracing the **mind-demon’s** origin where its power thrives.\n*\"Red in hundreds of thousands,\"*\nFire **intensifies**, color **burns bright**—\nDescribing the **mind-demon’s** rampant might.\n\nFeigning **suffering from calamity and capture** to seek rescue,\nAnd falsely claiming **lands, kinfolk** to offer **bribes**—\nAll are **exaggerations** of the **mind-demon’s** ever-shifting **deceitful schemes**.\n\n**Bajie** wields the **staff of precepts (戒刀)** and cuts the **rope** to free the **demon**,\nUnable to **perceive the mind** and thus **break precepts** to **free the mind**.\n\nThe **Elder** commands the **child** to **ride the horse** and take it away,\nYet **has not subdued nature** and thus **reluctantly allows the horse to follow its nature**.\n\n*\"Do not let the two monks carry it,\"*\n*\"I am glad to carry it myself,\"*\nThe **fire-demon** laughs and **recklessly subdues the gold**.\n\n*\"Only three catties in weight,\"*\n*\"This frame is so light,\"*\nThe **gold-demon** is **manifest yet secretly harbors fire**,\nA **confused yet enlightened** state where **evil and true principle** persist through time.\n\nThe ancient poem thus states:\n*\"When Dao and virtue tower high, the demonic miasma rises high,\nFor the mind’s essence is inherently still—yet from stillness arises malevolence.\nThe Mind-Lord walks upright in the Middle Way,\nYet the Wood-Mother, dull and misguided, strays beyond and falls into chaos.\n\nThe Thought-Bird speaks not yet harbors amorous cravings,\nThe Yellow-Crone utters no words yet frets with anxious heat.\nWhen rogue thoughts gain sway, they bring only fleeting joy,\nFor in the end, they dissolve from the very place where virtue was rooted.*\n\nIt speaks of how when the Middle Way is disturbed by agitation,\nOne cannot remain steadfast—thus stillness breeds malevolence.\nThe Mind-Lord is inherently upright,\nYet when fire stirs, the Wood-Mother falters—unable to grasp true principle, that is *\"straying beyond and falling into chaos.\"*\nLike the pulse of the Yin and Yang, the two chaotic paths,\nNot guided by the Middle Way.\n\nWhen lost, the Thought-Bird no longer obeys the Mind-Lord,\nAnd amorous cravings arise—when cravings stir, the steadfast virtue is disordered,\nBringing upon itself anxious heat.\n\nOnly when rogue thoughts are rooted out from the place of virtue\nCan one attain true stillness—stillness within movement,\nMovement within stillness—like the steadfast virtue itself.\nThen rogue thoughts have no power to run rampant.\nThis poem elucidates the core principle of the outline: *\"Monkey-Horse-Staff-Gui-Wood-Mother-Empty.\"*\nIt is the true peril of a disordered mind.\n\nWhen the mind is disordered, unable to remain steadfast,\nThe Monkey’s and Horse’s gold and water,\nThe Staff’s and Gui’s two soils,\nThe Wood-Mother’s wood and fire,\nAll lose their true nature and become empty—\nThat is the meaning: *\"Where fire arises from wood, disaster will certainly strike.\"*\n\n*\"The Great Sage’s heart brims with resentment,\"*\nSteadfast virtue disrupted by movement;\n*\"That demon’s heart ignites with fury, stirring a whirlwind, hurling sand and stone,\"*\nMovement without steadfast virtue.\n\nThe Master’s traces vanish—\nThe mind is obscured, and nature falls into confusion.\n\nThe Pilgrim and Bajie confer, each parting their ways—\nThe mind is disordered, and the Five Phases become empty.\n\nSha Wujing says:\n*\"It has a beginning but no end.\"*\nIt means one can cultivate the vital breath (命) but not the nature (性).\n\nYet those who can truly begin and end are entirely reliant on the Thought-Soil (意土).\nWhen the Thought-Soil is sincere, the Mind-Lord stands upright,\nAnd delusion can be dispelled.\nSha Wujing is the Thought-Soil.\nThus the Pilgrim says:\n*\"Since the virtuous younger brother has such sincere resolve,\nWe shall still go in search of that demon,\nTo rescue the Master.\"*\n\nThe Great Sage’s heart burns with true anguish—\nThe Thought-Soil is sincere, and the Mind-Lord stands upright.\n\n*\"Transforming into three heads and six arms,\"*\nThree of Heaven’s, six of Earth’s—\nRealigning the cosmos, fixing the upper and lower positions—\nSteadfast virtue.\n\n*\"Strike eastward one path, strike westward another path,\nAnd strike forth a band of impoverished gods.\"*\nAh!\n\nAh, wondrous indeed!\n\nFor truly, sincere intent must first attain knowledge—\nto fail in attaining knowledge while striving for sincerity is folly, not sincerity.\nHow then could one clarify the heart and perceive the nature?\n\nThus the virtuous seeker values profound inquiry into subtle changes,\nexhausting the divine to fathom transformations,\nso as to exhaust their variations.\n\n*\"Strip one layer, hang one layer,\nPants without a crotch, trousers without a mouth.\"*\nThe utmost exhaustion—\nto illuminate exhaustion by probing its essence,\nand to exhaust its transformations utterly.\n\n*\"Six hundred *jie* drills piercing the mountain,\nEncompassing thirty mountain deities,\nThirty earthly deities.\"*\nSpeaking of the Earth’s circular expanse,\nvast and broad, six hundred *jie* in measure.\n\nThis is as the *Parameters of the Mysterious Unity* says:\n*\"Six-five, the receptive bearing,\nBinding the beginning and end,\"*\n*\"Sixty folds gathered on one axle.\"*\nFor the Earth thrice generates fire,\ncapable of piercing upward with fiery heat—\nthe *Li* hexagram’s symbol of clarity and dissolution.\n\nWhen it follows Heaven’s bestowal,\nit harmonizes its nature and nurtures all things;\nWhen the Earth’s fire is excessive,\nit distorts its nature and scorches all living beings.\n\nThe deities lament:\n*\"They grind our heads smooth,\nleaving no incense, no paper—\nno blood offerings at all.\nThey demolish our shrines,\nstrip our robes,\nand leave us no peace.\"*\n\nWhat harm is this but the rampant fury of fire’s nature?\nLike a greedy official’s tyrannical blaze—\ncruel and oppressive—\nhe plunders the people’s sustenance,\nstrips the earth bare.\nTheir hearts and their harm are one and the same.\n\n*\"Gutted-tree ravine, cloud-cave flames\"*—\nthis describes the scorching inferno,\nwooden fire raging, its smoke blinding the sky.\n\nThey speak of their parents—\nthe Bull Demon and the Rakshasa,\noriginally demonic,\nrefined in the Fire Mountain’s *sanmei* practice—\na perverse *sanmei*,\nthe extreme of evil,\nnot the true, upright *sanmei* of enlightenment.\nThey are called *\"Holy Infant King\"*—\ninfant yet self-sacred,\ninfant yet self-enthroned,\ninfant yet self-augmented—\nmerely ignorance incarnate.\n\nTruly, *\"Before refinement, the infant’s demon-fire prevails,\"*\nurgently requiring *\"the Monkey-Heart and Wooden-Mother to uphold it.\"*\nHow terrifying, how perilous!\n\n---\n**Forty-first Chapter: The Monkey-Heart Defeated by Fire, the Wooden-Mother Captured by the Demon**\n\nA sage of old said:\n*\"To let emotion return to its nature,\nfirst teach fire to retreat within the heart.\nTwo forces merge as one essence—\ngolden elixir everywhere.\"*\n\nAgain he said:\n*\"To preserve longevity, first restrain desire.\nIf desire-fire does not falter, the spirit steadies itself.\nWood returns to fire, yet does not turn to ash—\nif one restrains desire, life extends.\"*\n\nFor emotion arises from nature,\nand wanders beyond virtue or vice—\nall driven by fire’s transformations.\nWithout fire, nothing is born;\nwithout fire, nothing is extinguished.\n\nThus fire’s power is most wondrous—\nfor good, it is potent;\nfor evil, even more so.\n\nNature is its root;\nthe heart, its dwelling;\nthe will, its trigger;\n*qi*, its manifestation.\n*\"Most vast, most rigid,\"*\nfilling heaven and earth,\nunassailable.\n\nIf one nurtures *qi* rightly,\nthe heart remains undisturbed,\nand nature steadies itself—\nharmonizing with the Dao.\n\nMencius spoke of *\"direct nourishment, vast and unharming\"*—\nthis is adjustment, rectitude, and stillness—\nthe true essence of *sanmei*.\n\nTo preserve the heart and nurture nature\nis to serve Heaven.\nHeaven’s lifespan is unchanging—\nthis is the foundation of one’s fate.\nGathering virtue brings forth the elixir;\nfollowing the natural order receives its rectitude.\nThe Dao of the Golden Elixir is now fully revealed.\n\nAh! This Dao was nearly exhausted by Mencius.\n\nThe immortal master’s treatise\nexposes those who harm the heart by failing to nurture *qi*,\nthus fully elucidating Mencius’ chapter on *\"nurturing qi.\"*\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"Calmness nurtures *qi*.\"\nMencius taught that *\"not forgetting, not assisting\"* is the proper way—\nboth emphasize cultivation before disturbance arises.\nBut once *qi* is aroused and forcibly suppressed,\nthis is already a step behind.\n\nThe opening verse holds the crucial secret of proper nurturing:\n*\"Forgive all wrongs in an instant,\nignore gain and loss alike.\nConceal or reveal—let fate decide,\neat when hungry, drink when thirsty.\nThe spirit, still and serene, remains ever quiet;\nif deluded, demons will intrude.\nThe Five Phases invert in the Zen halls—\nwhen wind stirs, cold seizes.\"*\n\nThe meaning is clear—\nno need for further explanation.\n\nThis is *\"clarifying the heart, seeing nature,\"*\nwhere all attachments dissolve,\nleaving not a thread behind.\nSerene and forgetful,\nquiet and unassisted—\nthis is the true nurturing of *qi*.\n\nThe final two lines warn:\nIf one cannot remain serene,\ncannot forget or assist,\neven in the Zen halls,\nencountering scenes will stir the heart—\nand this is not true nurturing.\n\nFire uses smoke as its messenger;\n*qi* takes anger as its form.\nThus Mencius used the examples of She and Yi’s *qi*-driven courage\nto illustrate its harm;\nthe immortal master used the Red Boy’s demonic *qi*\nto depict its malevolence.\n\nFire is *qi*;\nsmoke is anger—\ntheir meaning is one.\n\n*\"Five swift chariots\"*—\nlight and easily agitated.\n*\"Pressing Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth\"*—\nfire governs the Five Phases,\njust as the heart governs the Five Organs,\nand anger governs the Seven Emotions.\nAs the verse says:\n*\"All generation and transformation stem from fire,\nfire pervades the boundless sky, bringing life to all.\"*\n\n*\"The demon lost the battle,\nthen pounded his own nose in defeat,\nspouting flames from his mouth,\nthick smoke from his nostrils,\nand fiery sparks from his eyes.\"*\nAll depict his *qi* erupting,\nshaking his heart.\n\nSeeing him strike his own nose, bleed,\nand declare victory by sealing the door—\nthis reveals his unchecked arrogance,\nhis reliance on fearlessness as strength,\nexposing his *qi*-driven fury.\n\nEight Rules exclaimed:\n*\"This wretch is shameless, unashamed!\"*\nAgain: *\"He unleashes such merciless fire!\"*\nAgain: *\"No hope!\"*\nAgain: *\"No justice—he sets the flames!\"*\nA true portrayal.\n\nEight Rules panicked,\nabandoning the Pilgrim,\nunwilling to engage further—\nunable to align with righteousness and the Dao, he faltered.\n\nSand Monk sought victory through the theory of *\"mutual generation and conquest,\"*\nusing Water to subdue Fire—\nbut this failed in principle,\nforcing suppression where harmony was needed—\na forced imposition like Zhi’s.\n\nThe Pilgrim sought rain from the Eastern Ocean,\nand the Dragon King sprayed water on the flames—\nlike the Song scholar’s desperate attempt to coax the shoots—\n*\"Pouring oil on fire,\nthe more he doused, the fiercer it burned.\"*\n\nNot only was it useless,\nbut it *\"attacked the heart with fire-qi,\ndriving the Three Souls from their dwellings.\"*\nThen came:\n*\"Qi choked his chest, his tongue grew cold,\nhis spirit scattered, his life abandoned.\"*\nThe shoots withered.\n\nEight Precepts and Sand Monk made the Pilgrim *\"sit cross-legged in meditation, practicing the massage-Dhyāna technique.\"*\n\n*\"In a short while, his qi passed through the Three Passes,*\n*turned at the Bright Hall,*\n*burst open the orifices,*\n*and he called out: ‘Master!’\"*\nSand Monk replied: *\"Brother, you were born my master—*\n*even in death, you remain in my words.\"*\n\nThere must be purpose in this,\nyet do not expect immediate results—\nkeep the heart undistracted.\n\n*\"Together they sat beneath the pine grove,*\n*and in a short time,*\n*his spirit settled, his qi harmonized.\"*\nThinking of *\"invoking Guanyin Bodhisattva\"*—\nthis was the gathering of virtue in action,\ngradually entering the subtle realm of nurturing the self.\n\nYet gathering virtue is how one nurtures the qi,\nand understanding speech is how one gathers virtue.\nUnable to discern speech,\none fails to grasp the truth—\ntrue and false become indistinguishable,\nand actions in motion or stillness lose their proper measure,\nleaving no path for virtue to gather.\n\nThe demon revealed the *Ruyi* skin-bag\nand lured Eight Precepts,\n*\"transforming into a false Guanyin to await him.\"*\n\nThe *Ruyi*—\nborn from his own mind;\nthe *\"false Guanyin\"*—\nemanating from his words;\nthe *\"skin-bag\"*—\na deceitful utterance.\n\nWords may be deceitful, lustful, perverse, or evasive,\nbut we focus on deceit,\nfor it most clearly obscures the mind—\nand one example suffices for the rest.\n\nEight Precepts, unable to distinguish true from false,\n*\"saw the image and took it for a Buddha,\"*\nbelieved the deceitful words,\nand was stuffed into the bag—\nunable to discern speech, he was deceived,\nand though he grasped at virtue, it failed to gather.\n\nThe demon said: *\"With your eyes wide open, you still don’t recognize me!\"*\n—revealing his own ignorance of his own deception.\n\nEight Precepts cursed from within the bag:\n*\"You’ve schemed every way to trick me into eating—*\n*I’ll make sure you suffer the heavenly plague!\"*\nHis words, born of malice, only harmed himself,\nfor he truly invited ruin upon his own nature.\n\nThe Pilgrim endured the pain and entered the demon’s cave,\ndaring not to confront him directly,\n*\"and transformed into a ‘melting-gold bundle’ to cast down.\"*\nThis transformation’s subtlety\nnearly defies recognition.\n\nFor the mind is a fire-hiding place—\none must not let it flare upward.\nThe character *bao* (包) carries the radical of *bao* (包),\nand though enclosure may seem profound,\nit ultimately harbors two kinds of discomfort.\nTo cast down the bundle,\nto abandon enclosure entirely—\nwhat liberation!\n\nThus, he transformed into a bundle and cast it down,\nto extinguish the flame.\n\n*\"Melting-gold\"*—\nthe image of fire refining gold.\nAncient seal script for the character *xin* (心) was simply an inverted *\"fire\"* (火),\nnot enclosed but made to submit downward—\njust as the Pilgrim *\"cast down the bundle,\"*\nand as before, the meaning of *\"letting go of the heart.\"*\n\nAgain, he transformed into a fly to scout ahead,\nnot first rescuing Eight Precepts\nbut following the Six Generals—\nthis was cautious, silent observation,\ndiscerning the root without confrontation,\ntemporarily easing tensions to restrain its outbreak.\n\nThis action already subtly penetrated the *sanmei* [三昧].\n\n**Chapter Forty-Two: The Great Sage Reverently Pays Homage to the Southern Sea, Guanyin Compassionately Binds Hong Hai**\n\nThe Sage said: *\"Nature is the decree of Heaven.*\n*Let its scope be as vast as Heaven’s, its duration as enduring as Heaven’s,*\n*let it arise from me, not from Heaven—*\n*yet it does not command one to indulge in fine food or sensual pleasures.*\n*Thus, it is undivided Heavenly Principle, without vice.*\n\n*When it manifests, it is also undivided Heavenly Principle, fully virtuous—*\n*this is called *following Nature*.*\n\n*If one follows Nature, it is *holding the Mean*, it is *True Suchness*,*\n*it is *Inner Elixir*, Sagehood, Immortality, and Buddhahood.*\n\n*But if there is even a hair’s breadth of partiality or perversity,*\n*it is no longer undivided Heavenly Principle.*\n\n*All partiality and perversity are evil, are demonic forces,*\n*are the private desires of the human heart obscuring truth.*\n\n*The undivided Heavenly Principle is nothing but *Ren*—*\n*it is *compassionate virtue*.\"*\n\n*To preserve the undivided Heavenly Principle, one must cultivate *qi*;\n*to cultivate *qi*, one must still the heart;\n*to still the heart, one must quiesce the mind;\n*to quiesce the mind, one must gather righteousness;\n*to gather righteousness, one must know speech;\n*to know speech, one must remove obstructions;\n*to remove obstructions, one must attain knowledge.*\n\n*This is called *refinement*.\"*\n\n*Within this chapter, the Pilgrim transforms into King Yumao,*\n*turning the Dao into demonic forces—*\n*this is not following Nature.*\n\n*The father and son’s reverent meeting, courteous and proper,*\n*is Nature, yet he acts within it.*\n\n*The boy calls himself *“Ignorant Son,”*—*\n*ignorance is obscuration, lacking clarity,*\n*unable to attain knowledge—*\n*this is Nature, yet truth cannot be seen through it.*\n\n*Of all Heaven’s natures, none surpasses that of father and son.*\n*The father deceives his son, mistaking a false son for the true one;*\n*the son, in his ignorance, mistakes a false father for the true one.*\n\n*The lesser demons all knelt and said:*\n*“Great King, you cannot even recognize your own father!”*\n*Words that lose the true for the false,*\n*and obscure the Heaven-given nature of one’s birth.*\n\n*To seek longevity while obscuring one’s Heavenly nature*\n*is like asking a false father for one’s birth chart,*\n*bothering Zhang Daoling to calculate the Five Stars of Ziwei*\n*in hopes of matching Heaven’s immortal lifespan—*\n*how could this succeed?*\n\n*To defy Heaven’s decree and violate filial piety,*\n*how is it different from striking one’s father and rebelling against one’s son?*\n*When conscience awakens, how could one not blush with shame?*\n\n*There are also those who falsely claim Daoist learning and misrecognize Heavenly nature,*\n*just as the Pilgrim falsely impersonates the demon king,*\n*pretending to hunt morality like a royal hunt.*\n\n*“Sitting in the central seat of the south”—*\n*occupying it without doubt.*\n\n*What they calculate is the distant concern of securing one’s livelihood and old age;*\n*what they boast of are their boundless transformations;*\n*what they gather are the clever appearances of mimicking others;*\n*what they uphold is the false austerity of thunder-fasts;*\n*what they recognize are the celestial omens of the *Liuzhi* [六爻].*\n\nThis is a heartless, depraved act of evil, yet they know not they are devouring men, these demons of life’s corruption!\nThe Pilgrim’s transformation—from true to false, then back again—is but a display of his cunning, his laughter a mockery of the unknowing.\n\nWhen he changes, let the unseeing open their blinded eyes;\nwhen he laughs, let the ignorant shrink their probing heads—\nfor wisdom lies in exposing folly at its root,\nnot in clashing banners on the battlefield.\nIt is like the water-worker who strives against the current,\nor the arsonist who seizes the wind.\n\n*\"No need to worry—I’ll fetch the Bodhisattva myself.\"*\n*\"Straight to the Southern Sea, to the cliffs of Lankā,*\n*and prostrate myself in homage!\"*\n\nHow clear the vision, how direct the path!\n\nThe Bodhisattva spoke in fury:\n*\"That wretch dares mimic my form!\"*\nWith a sweep of his gem-studded alms-bowl,\nhe hurled it into the sea’s depths.\n\nThe Pilgrim scoffed:\n*\"This Bodhisattva’s fire has not yet cooled.\"*\n\nBefore he could finish, the waves churned—\na tortoise surfaced, bearing the bowl ashore,\nand knelt in twenty-four obeisances.\n\n*\"Ah, the Keeper of the Bowl!\"* said the Pilgrim.\n\nThe Bodhisattva commanded:\n*\"Pilgrim, take the bowl!\"*\nNot a drop could be moved.\n\n*\"You do not know,\"* said the Bodhisattva,\n*\"that it was always empty—\nbut cast into the sea,\nit now holds all its waters within.\nWhat strength could you have to lift the ocean?\nThus, you cannot take it.\"*\n\nAlas!\n\n「Ah! How wondrous this is!\n\nThe commentator says: *\"The tortoise bearing the bowl,*\n*along with the later episodes of the lotus petals crossing the sea,*\n*the Dragon Princess plucking hairs—*\n*all these exchanges, leisurely unfolded,*\n*seem unrelated to the main text,*\n*merely serving as a foil to the Red Boy.\"*\n\n*\"Like the painter’s words:*\n*'‘Fine grasses and fallen flowers make a brocade land,’*\n*these fallen flowers are but embellishments*\n*to adorn the fine grasses,*\n*thus completing the brocade.\"*\n\n*Yet this passage reveals the Immortal Master’s*\n*application of profound truth,*\n*crafting a marvelous form—*\n*truly the core of the main text.*\n\n*His imaginings and strokes*\n*possess a divine, ghostly artistry,*\n*beyond mortal reach.*\n*Among a hundred chapters,*\n*this stands as peerless masterwork!*\n\n*Laozi teaches:*\n*\"Through kindness, one attains courage;\nThrough frugality, one attains breadth;\nBy not daring to lead the world,*\n*one achieves enduring greatness.\"*\n\n*In ancient times,*\n*the Duke of Zhou and King Wu,*\n*in their wrath, settled the land;*\n*Confucius, in his wrath,*\n*rectified the four cardinal directions—*\n*great courage indeed.*\n\n*Yet only through great kindness*\n*could such great courage arise.*\n*The demon’s guise as a false Bodhisattva,*\n*deceptive yet plausible,*\n*confuses truth with falsehood—*\n*the foremost trick of evil spirits,*\n*most destructive in its harm.*\n\n*The Bodhisattva, in great kindness,*\n*thus raged:*\n*\"That wretch dares mimic my form!\"*\n*\"With a sweep of my gem-studded alms-bowl,*\n*I cast it into the sea’s depths!\"*\n*Clear in vision, resolute in deed—*\n*this is “Through kindness, one attains courage.”*\n\n*The *Huainanzi* states:*\n*\"There is essence yet it is not used,*\n*there is spirit yet it is not employed.*\n*In harmony with the Great Primordial Purity,*\n*one stands within the realm of utmost clarity.\"*\n*This is the Way of frugality.*\n\n*\"‘Always an empty bowl,*\n*cast into the sea,*\n*now it holds all its waters within—*\n*you cannot lift it.’\"*\n*The empty bowl is the epitome of frugality,*\n*and only through such frugality*\n*does one attain boundless breadth,*\n*as in the saying:*\n*\"‘A sesame seed can contain Mount Sumeru,*\n*a hair can swallow the great ocean.’\"*\n*This is “Through frugality, one attains breadth.”*\n\n*The *Book of Documents* says:*\n*\"One must have capacity,*\n*then virtue grows great;*\n*one must endure,*\n*then salvation is achieved.\"*\n*This speaks of vast Qi/breath,*\n*encompassing all with serene cultivation.*\n\n*Among the myriad creatures,*\n*the tortoise is the longest-lived,*\n*taken as a symbol of guarding the female*\n*and nurturing with wisdom.*\n*The sage composed the *I Ching*’s *Yi Hexagram*,*\n*its first line modeled on the tortoise,*\n*to show how the virtuous one*\n*cultivates themselves.*\n\n*\"‘Seeing the waves churn,*\n*a tortoise emerges,*\n*bearing the alms-bowl to the cliffs,’*\n*it carries its burden with ease,*\n*lifting what others cannot—*\n*is this not*\n*'By not daring to lead the world,*\n*one achieves enduring greatness’?\"*\n\n*This contrasts sharply*\n*with the Red Boy’s reckless triumph,*\n*void of cultivation.*\n\n*The Pilgrim bowed in reverence:*\n*\"This disciple does not know.\"*\n*I too bowed in reverence:*\n*\"This disciple does not know.\"*\n*Will those who read this book in ages to come,*\n*and grasp my meaning,*\n*also bow and say*\n*\"‘This disciple does not know’?\"*\n\n*\"The Bodhisattva’s right hand lifts the bowl,*\n*resting it on his left palm—*\n*flowing effortlessly,*\n*a display of mastery,*\n*the third *Dhyāna* of perfect stillness.\"*\n\n*Yet how does the water arise,*\n*if the bowl holds the sea*\n*and the tortoise dives beneath?*\n*Unknown to the common eye,*\n*the bowl’s contents are not mere water,*\n*but the very Qi of the ocean—*\n*formless, untouched by substance.*\n*Thus the Bodhisattva declares:*\n*\"‘My bowl holds sweet dew,*\n*not like the Dragon King’s spray,*\n*which can extinguish that demon’s*\n*threefold *Dhyāna* flame.’\"*\n\n*With the true water of *Dhyāna*,*\n*he subdues the false fire of *Dhyāna*—*\n*using spirit, not mere form,*\n*exemplifying the art of perfect cultivation.*\n*What need then for the mind’s wild flames?*\n\n*When the mind is unrestrained,*\n*it seeks dominance,*\n*burning fiercely like wildfire;*\n*when the mind is still and true,*\n*it guards the female,*\n*nurturing like sweet dew.*\n\n*The wildfire*\n*is the demon’s torment,*\n*consuming the heart;*\n*the sweet dew*\n*is the elixir,*\n*irrigating the soul.*\n*The tortoise is indeed the Red Boy’s*\n*tailored antidote.*\n\n*As for the alms-bowl,*\n*it cradles true Qi,*\n*vast and tranquil,*\n*not merely empty and detached—*\n*this is the Dao of*\n*\"non-action yet transformation,*\n*stillness yet creation.\"*\n\n*Should one harbor*\n*a hint of grasping or attachment,*\n*they could never fathom its depths.*\n*Thus the Bodhisattva again*\n*illustrates the Dragon Princess’s*\n*and the precious bowl’s reluctance to part,*\n*showing that such treasures*\n*are not easily obtained.*\n\n*It is not the Bodhisattva who is hard to part from,*\n*but the Pilgrim’s own*\n*indulgence and stinginess*\n*that make the Bodhisattva’s gifts difficult.*\n*Hence, the tight-skin cauldron’s removal,*\n*and the Bodhisattva’s words:*\n*\"‘You are at ease.’\"*\n*To let go is not to abandon,*\n*but to transcend.*\n\n*The Pilgrim plucking hairs,*\n*fearing it might save his life,*\n*the Bodhisattva says:*\n*\"‘Not a hair shall you pluck,*\n*for even my treasure, Shàncái,*\n*I cannot part with.’\"*\n*Stinginess thus makes parting hard.*\n\n*Wealth and desire*\n*are external temptations,*\n*while Shàncái is the true nature’s*\n*wondrous manifestation.*\n*The Bodhisattva reveals:*\n*Shàncái’s reluctance to part,*\n*showing how one sees goodness*\n*in wealth,*\n*divines its use,*\n*discerns the difficulty of letting go,*\n*and awakens to the act of release itself.*\n\n*This is where the Master*\n*blends truth with metaphor,*\n*logic with divine inspiration—*\n*a realm akin to*\n*\"the Heavenly Maiden scattering flowers,\"*\n*not to be read lightly.*\n\n*Emerging from filth yet pure,*\n*the lotus stands alone,*\n*thus its petals can serve as*\n*the universal vessel of compassion,*\n*blown by the breath of Dao,*\n*dispelling all afflictions,*\n*what fear of the boundless sea of suffering?*\n\n*To even the emotions*\n*and achieve harmony,*\n*one must endure.*\n*Thus the *Gāng* blade can form*\n*the Bodhisattva’s seat of Dharma,*\n*as he sits serene,*\n*clouds gathering around,*\n*unfazed by even the mightiest trials.*\n\n*The Dragon Princess splits the lotus,*\n*ascending to the other shore,*\n*while Huì’àn leans on the cosmic *Gāng*’s power,*\n*transforming into a lotus platform—*\n*both reveal the clarity of true nature.*\n\n*The Bodhisattva overturns the alms-bowl,*\n*pours the water like thunder;*\n*extends the willow branch,*\n*turns the blade into a hook.*\n*The reader may think:*\n*\"‘The water poured to quench the fire,*\n*a preemptive strike;*\n*the lotus seat to ensnare the blade,*\n*a victory without battle—*\n*the utmost of goodness.’\"*\n\nAll have lost their subtlety.\n\nThey do not grasp\nthat overturning the alms-bowl like thunder’s roar\nis itself *delusion*—\nfor it points to their delusion\nand lets them awaken on their own.\n\nTo awaken with wisdom against delusion\nonly makes the deluded more so;\nto delude with delusion\nmakes the deluded awaken themselves.\nThus the Dao of skillful guidance\nis to let them awaken with goodness,\nnot to let them delude with goodness.\n\nSitting on the lotus platform to learn the Bodhisattva’s way,\nthat is awakening—\nfor they hear of the path to awakening\nand know their own delusion.\nTo awaken the awakened,\nyet the awakened seem deluded,\nto delude the awakened\nyet the awakened grow ever more awake.\nThus the law of skillful transformation\nis to let them awaken fully,\nnot to let them delude fully.\n\nThe alms-bowl tilted writes the character *迷* (delusion),\n*come, come, come*—\nobserve how distant the land is from the surging tides,\nwhere does the little cart still gallop on its old tracks?\n\nThe blade’s tip becomes the platform of awakening,\n*sit, sit, sit*—\nwho knows the glory of the hollow is but a trick of the edge?\nHow could one endure an empty blade swung to nothing?\n\nThe Wayfarer rages in anger,\nthe great compassion of skillful guidance;\nthe demon rages in anger,\nthe great awakening of being ensnared in delusion.\n\nWondrous indeed!\nThe Bodhisattva asks twice yet gives no answer,\nquelling their reckless striving.\n\nThe demon strikes with one spear,\npiercing the heart and exposing its core—\nsitting there,\npointing to that very place—\nhow could it ever have been truly fixed?\n\nOne must know the mind of *non-abiding* (無住) and birth—\n*strike, strike, go*—\nonly when the heart dies\nis it truly born anew;\nurgently seek to lay all down at once.\n\n*\"Three top supports\"* (三个顶搭)\nclearly mark the three stars of the mind,\nsupporting heaven and earth as the Three *Talents* (三才).\nDo not thrust into the flames of fire.\n\n*\"Five binding straps\"* (五个箍儿)\nembody the five virtues within the body,\ngathering the spirit and consolidating the *qi*,\nrestoring innate virtue—\nrejoicing in the golden nest of ease.\n\n*\"Called the Child of Wealth\"* (善财童子),\nhuman nature is inherently good,\nand all talents are good—\nmerely affirming their goodness.\n\nThis is the cultivation of the boundless *Hàorán* *qi* (浩然之氣),\nrevealing true nature and clarifying the mind,\nthe wondrous Dao of great compassion and great pity.\n\nIts essence points to no other than *\"rightness and stillness\"* (正定),\nhence the saying:\n*\"A single word can recognize the sands of the Ganges,*\n*boundless and profound is the law’s power.\"*\n\n**Forty-third Chapter**\n*Black River Demon Captures the Monk*\n*The Western Dragon Child Snatches the Turtle*\n**Awakened One** says:\nThis passage follows the Black Boy’s ability to stabilize his true nature and perceive the great compassion—\nwhen the true heart is clear, wild impulses dissolve.\nThe Black Turtle, unable to nurture its true nature, churns waves and follows currents—\nwhen false desires stir, the true nature sways,\ndemonstrating the harm of letting nature be swayed by the heart’s movements.\nThe former preserves the heart,\nthis cultivates the nature.\n\nThe Bodhisattva takes away the sea’s waters,\nthe child returns to its right fruit,\nthe Wayfarer releases the Three Treasures and Eight Rules,\nfirmly vowing to journey west.\nThe fire-nature of self-arising is already subdued,\nyet the water-nature of outward dispersion still lingers.\n*\"Suddenly hearing the sound of water\"* stirs the heart again,\nunable to keep the mind as still as water.\n\nThus the Wayfarer raises the *Heart Sutra* (多心經) again to clarify the Six *Thieves* (六贼).\nEye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind—\nthe Six *Thieves* of Heaven;\ncolor, sound, scent, taste, touch, and *dharma* (法)—\nthe Six *Thieves* of the World.\nIf the Six *Thieves* of Heaven are not understood,\nthe Six *Thieves* of the World will ride in separately;\nif the Six *Thieves* of the World are not removed,\nthe Six *Thieves* of Heaven will steal together.\nMutually harming and robbing,\nthe vital *qi* is lost along with it—\nall from failing to forget the artifices and kill the heart to invite this fate.\nHence the saying:\n*\"Summoning these six thieves in confusion,*\n*how can one reach the Western Paradise to see the Buddha?\"*\n\nIf one seeks success,\nit must be through purifying the heart and nurturing the nature,\nnot letting the heart hold even a speck of love, desire, greed, anger, or delusion.\n\nThe harm of greed and delusion\nis no greater than the Black Waters surging like tides,\nthe little turtle as a demonic force.\n*\"The Black Water River God’s domain in Hengyang Pass\"* (衡阳峪黑水河神府)\nrefers to the Kidney Palace (肾宫),\nwhere the true spirit resides.\nThe little turtle, relying on its strength,\nseizes and plunders its domain—\nthat is the unruly *qi* of greed and delusion.\nIt calls itself *\"the foolish nephew\"* (愚甥),\nclearly a confession of guilt.\nThe foolish one is he who confuses right and wrong—\ncompare it with the Black Boy’s *\"foolish son\"* (愚男),\nboth reveal their greedy ignorance,\nnot humility.\n\nThe turtle dwells in the Black Waters yet names itself *\"pure\"* (洁),\nlike a man harboring filthy thoughts yet unaware of his impurity.\nThe Dragon King tells the Great Sage:\n*\"This is my younger sister’s ninth son. Because his father-in-law delayed the rains,\nhe was sentenced by the Heavenly Tribunals to be beheaded by Wei Zheng,\nleaving behind this nephew, who nurtures his nature and cultivates truth in the Black Water River,\nunexpectantly committing such evil.\"*\n\nThe ninth son, the youngest son.\nThe turtle’s purity—its youngest son;\nthe turtle’s impurity—is it not the second son?\nSeeing this, does my earlier note that the Old Dragon is Li Yuan hold true?\n\nIts father was in the murky waters of Jingyang (泾阳),\nand his rains came too late;\nits son is also in the Black Waters of Hengyang (衡阳),\nyet commits this evil.\nJing (泾) as Heng (衡),\nperhaps the family custom.\n\nIt knows the Heavenly Tribunals sentenced Wei Zheng to behead its father,\nyet does not know the Three Treasures journey west to retrieve scriptures,\nto transcend and deliver its father;\nnor does it know the Three Treasures retrieve scriptures\nfor whom’s sake—\nwith a muddled heart and perverse actions,\nit even thinks of boiling the Tripitaka Master’s flesh for food,\na blazing lust of desire,\nonly caring to fulfill its cravings,\nunknowing of its father’s nature,\nunknowing of its own fate.\n\nAlas!\nIgnorance of nature and injury to filial duty—\nwhat filth is worse than this?\n\n「Its source already polluted, its current cannot but be unclean—\nwhere then is purity to be found?\n\nWithin the chapter, the tale of the Heavenly Tribunals beheading the Black Waters Dragon is again raised,\nto show that without cultivating the heart to nourish one’s nature,\none cannot serve the Heavenly Dao—\nthus incurring the Heavenly Tribunals’ punishment.\n\nMao Kang gathered troops to avenge wrongs,\nand in one battle, the dragon was captured—\nthe Tripitaka Master and Eight Rules were freed,\nand the dragon was spared execution,\n*\"for the sake of my noble father’s face,\"*\nand sent westward.\n\nThough the dragon’s accomplices were pardoned out of leniency,\nthis was truly inviting Heaven’s favor.\n\nThe heart governs the Six Desires,\nand among them, the Black Waters Dragon’s desire is most difficult to restrain.\n\nThe immortal master composed another passage,\nusing veiled speech and allegory,\nhighlighting its core essence—\nto awaken clarity of nature and purity of heart,\nsubtly contrasting with the Black Waters Dragon and its journey through the Underworld.\nThe passage merely points to its ambiguous heart,\nand uses symbols to convey its meaning—\nits intent is profound.\n\n*\"The River God summoned the art of obstructing the waters,\nblocking the upper current.\nSoon, the lower flow dried up,\nand a great path opened.\"*\n\nThis is the method of uprooting and sealing the source,\nforcing the waters against their nature\nand preventing the lower flow—\ntruly the key to cultivating nature and attaining immortality.\n\nThe great path westward was revealed,\nRed Boy was bound while the Black Crocodile returned,\nand the Three Mysteries of pure cultivation were attained.\n\nYet why does the text say that whenever demons and monsters capture the Tripitaka Master,\nthey claim:\n*\"The Golden Cicada reincarnation,\na body of true yang refined over ten lifetimes—\nif someone eats even a piece of his flesh,\nit will extend their lifespan and grant eternal youth\"*?\n\nBecause this text is written specifically for the Dao of Gold Elixir.\nThose demons and monsters symbolize those who practice perverse, heretical methods,\nhoping vainly for longevity—\nthey are likened to refining gold elixir into a tangible, substantial form,\nhence the *\"Golden Cicada reincarnation\"*;\nthe *\"true yang of the primordial body refined over ten lifetimes\"*;\nand the *\"eating his flesh grants eternal youth\"*.\n\nThey do not know that the Elixir of Rebirth is originally formless,\nunlike the Tripitaka Master’s blood and flesh—\nthis is why they are considered heretical demons.\n\nIt boasts of its name, *\"Mountain Until the Black River,\"*\nspanning tens of thousands of words,\na vast and profound discourse,\nexpounding the mysteries of the Dao,\nall rooted in the benevolent cultivation of the heart\nby Master Zhuang.\n\nSome say this text belongs to the lineage of Zhong and Lü,\nbut they do not know it traces directly back to Mencius’ Dao.\n\nThe discerning may judge accordingly.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Four: The Law Body and Primordial Fate Encounter the Ox-Cart’s Power**\n**The Rectified Heart Overcomes the Heretical Demons at the Ridge Pass**\n\nA scholar said: These three passages are specifically written to refute external Daoist sects.\n\nExternal sects, like those seeking entry through side doors and alleys,\ntwisting and turning, devious and unorthodox,\nare rarely able to attain true fruition—\nwhy?\n\nFor those who advance at the proper time,\ntheir foundation must align with the Heavenly Dao’s path.\nExternal sects, however, are like galloping recklessly along walls and byways,\nnever finding their true path.\n\nThe multitude of heretical practices disrupts the scriptures,\ntheir licentiousness only serves to destroy the body.\n\nWithin the chapter, the three Daoists—Peach Force, Deer Force, and Sheep Force—\nembody the external sects in all their forms.\n\nThe external sects number three hundred and sixty,\nbut they are divided into three categories:\nopening the Three Passes,\noperating the Ox-Cart,\nascending the Ridge,\nand the methods of mud pellets, chest supplementation, and returning essence—\nall these are recorded in *The Yellow Court* and *The Spirit Pivot*,\nalong with the true scriptures of the immortals.\nLater generations failed to receive the true transmission,\nand passed on these methods in error—\nthey seem plausible but are fundamentally false,\nthe most likely to mislead and cause harm.\n\nGuangchengzi said:\n*\"Cease your laborious efforts with the Ox-Cart and Elixir Furnace,\nfor the Blessed Embryo of the Crane and the Breath of the Tortoise\nare naturally everlasting.\"*\n\nBecause the human body contains Heaven and Earth,\neach inhalation and exhalation has its own roots and connections.\nThe Governing and Conception Vessels follow the movement of the qi,\nforming the natural rotation of Heaven’s fate—\nlike the Ox-Cart.\n\nThose who falsely practice opening the Three Passes,\nturning the pulley,\nand forcefully manipulate their essence,\ndisturbing their bones—\nall these are unnatural,\ncontrary to Heaven and harmful to principle,\nand sever the Great Dao.\n\nThey do not realize that the Ox-Cart is Heaven’s natural design,\nits divine movement ceaseless—\nonce human interference begins,\nit becomes choked and stagnant,\nblood congeals and qi solidifies,\nand strange poisons and chronic diseases arise—\nthis is truly the method of hastening death.\n\nThe border of Ox-Cart Country lies between the Black River and the Heaven-Piercing River,\nembodying the meaning of the Ox-Cart’s stagnation.\n\nThe disciples heard the commotion\nand assumed it was an earthquake, mountains collapsing,\nthunderous claps of lightning,\nand cries of people and neighing of horses—\nall descriptions of unnatural, forced actions,\nevoking dread and astonishment.\n\n*\"The Tripitaka Master saw many monks gathered in clusters,\npulling the cart with all their might,\nand striking drums for power,\"*\n—this reveals their failure to harmonize the Five Phases,\nto align with the natural unity of things,\nand to follow the effortless Dao.\n\n*\"The cart was loaded with bricks, tiles, wood, and plants,\"*\n—this shows they were collecting dross, heavy and impure substances.\n\nAfter recounting the high slopes, the narrow Ridge Pass, and the great pass,\n*\"How can the cart be pulled up such steep cliffs?\"*\n—all these directly point to their erroneous forcing of energy,\nand their ignorance of the subtle marvels of the Ox-Cart’s natural rotation.\n\nThe Tripitaka Master transformed into the Cloud and Water Immortal,\nand questioned the foreman Daoist about the reason—\nthen went straight to the riverbank,\npassed the Twin Pass,\nand descended the Ridge,\nrequiring no effort at all—\nhow effortlessly he moved with the circumstances!\n\nThe monks said:\n*\"He knows how to refine elixir and transmute mercury,\nand turn stones into gold.\"*\n\nIf the external sects regard operating the Ox-Cart as internal alchemy,\nand refining lead and mercury for consumption as external alchemy,\nthen this is their beginning and end—\nleading the blind and believing in delusion,\nlike a madman or a wild horse,\nand ultimately, never achieving success even unto old age.»\n\nThe lifespan may be slightly prolonged,\nyet it is but a ghostly existence in a spectral abode.\nThus the venerable master said,\n*\"You cannot escape,\"*\n*\"You cannot die.\"*\nNeither death nor life—\nnot true longevity,\nbut merely prolonged suffering.\n\nHow could one attain the *arhat*’s journey to the Western Heaven for scriptures,\nor the divine powers of the Heavenly Worthy of Equaling Heaven,\nto redress this injustice among mortals?\n\nThe Tripitaka Master said:\n*\"Five hundred souls are kin to me.\"*\nThe Buddha spoke:\n*\"All sentient beings are my disciples.\"*\nOriginally boundless and impartial,\nwith neither inner nor outer distinctions—\nyet now you cling so desperately—\nwhat then is this vast compassion?\n\n*\"Unsheathing the Golden Hoop Staff,\na single strike to slay!\"*\nJust as Vajrapāṇi wields his demon-subduing scepter\nto crush demons and deliver the monks.\n\nThe Tripitaka Master revealed his true form,\nand the monks bowed in reverence,\nbegging him to subdue the demon and restore order.\n*\"Quickly drag the Ox-Cart past the Twin Pass,\nthrough the Ridge,\nlift it high and hurl it to shatter—\nlet the bricks, tiles, wood, and plants all tumble down the slope!\"*\n\nTruly excellent!\nTruly excellent!\n\nRestoring the original essence of the Law-body,\nshattering the sluggishness of the demon’s strength,\nupholding the loyal and virtuous single mind,\nrighting the crooked ridge of demonic deceit—\ndirect, swift, and resolute,\ncombining wisdom and courage.\n\nLife and vitality—body, mind, essence, and breath—\neveryone may preserve them whole.\n\nMost wondrous is when the Great Sage plucks a hair,\neach teaching twists it into the fingernail of the ring finger,\nclenches it in a fist,\nand calls—it answers instantly,\neach summoning the Great Sage to appear and guard them,\nso that no demonic intrusion may prevail.\n\nThe ring finger belongs to the heart,\nspeaking of how one’s thoughts may be as fine as hair—\nfirmly held in mind,\nwith every thought invoking the Sage,\nhow could there be any demonic obstruction?\n\nEvery person’s heart harbors Confucius,\nevery monk’s hand holds the Great Sage—\nstill and unmoving,\nyet responsive when called—\nthe most profound and wondrous Dao.\n\nThe Master’s words are divine and wondrous;\nreaders must truly grasp their meaning.\n\nThis is the radiant wisdom,\nlike awakening from a dream—\nwhen the old monk of Zhìyǔ Temple first saw the Tripitaka Master,\nhe bowed and called him \"Grandfather\"—\nwas it not Zhìbái Jinxīng saving human life in a dream?\n\nThe Three Monks secretly visited the Three Pure Ones’ Hall,\nextinguishing the lamp’s light,\ntransforming into the Highest Venerable, Primordial Beginning, and Numinous Treasure,\ndemonstrating that Buddha is Taoist, Taoist is Buddha—\nthough teachings differ in schools,\ntheir essence is one.\n\nTo neglect Zhìyǔ Temple\nis to extinguish the Three Pure Ones’ Hall.\n\nIf both sides harbor deceit—\nmonks gluttonously stealing offerings,\nTaoists hiding their ears and groping for the golden bell—\nthey invite the laughter of the discerning.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Five: The Great Sage Leaves His Name at the Three Pure Ones’ Hall, the Monkey King Reveals His Law in the Country of Carrying the Chariot**\n\nWùyī Zǐ says:\nThis passage elucidates the elixir of the Saintly Water—\nborn of cultivation, not supplication;\ntrue nature and emptiness are one,\nrelying entirely on divine efficacy,\nnot on sensory indulgence.\n\nIt shatters false paths,\npointing to ultimate truth.\n\nCool and detached in tone,\nyet everywhere a warning.\n\nThe Three Daoists—Hǔlì, Lùlì, and Yánglì—\nproclaimed themselves Great Immortals,\nchanting sutras to avert calamities and seek longevity for the realm.\nYet ignorant of the Dao’s true essence,\nhow could they discern the Three Pure Ones’ authenticity?\n\nThey suspected the Celestial Vessel’s descent,\nkneeling to beg for the Saintly Water elixir—\nlike common folk worshipping stars or invoking spirit-writing tablets,\npraying for extended life.\nTheir delusion knows no bounds!\n\nThe Great Sage agreed to leave the elixir,\nyet the \"Three Immortals\" carried it in a bucket,\na basin, or a bottle—\nlike mortals clinging to *Bāduànjǐn*, *Liùzìjué*, or *Shíliùzì hūxī*,\nor refining autumn stone and red lead to swallow,\neach sealing their own vessel—\nfar surpassing even the *Chénglù jīnjīng*,\nyet still grasping at longevity and celestial favor.\nHow absurd!\n\nThe three monks each indulged in their own *niè*—\nnot jesting, but profound insight.\nFor swallowing saliva or inhaling qi\nare both matters of *yin* substance;\nautumn stone and red lead,\nwhen refined, yield filth and impurities—\noften stemming from *niè*.\nThus, the Sage spoke plainly:\n*\"You drink but the urine of your own niè!\"*\n\nEven the Three Teachings’ sages have referenced *niè* in speaking of the Dao:\nThe Buddhist scriptures say, *\"The Dao lies in the dry excrement stake.\"*\nThe *Nánhuá* [Zhuangzi] declares, *\"The Dao is in excrement and urine.\"*\nThe *Dàxué* [Great Learning] warns, *\"Like hating foul odors.\"*\nYet even in the most putrid transformation lies divine marvel—\nthe receptive and pure restoring the original.\nIn the most turbid depths lies the purest essence.\n*Niè* is not entirely unworthy of mention in the Dao—\nyet how laughable that seekers of the Dao should fixate upon it!\n\nTruly wise, the Great Sage said,\n*\"Just leave my name instead.\"*\nFor mortals, lost in wild speculation,\nknowing not the Dao’s nature,\nhe must shout aloud:\n**\"Dao/Hao! Dao/Hao!**\n**You fool, lost in such chaotic thought!\"**\n\nThere are Three Pure Ones—\nwould they deign to descend to mortal form?\nI shall reveal my true surname,\nand make you understand.\n\nThe Wayfarer has no father or mother—\nhow then could he have a surname?\nHis surname was bestowed by the Ancestor of Bodhi,\nthe true transmission of life’s essence.\n\nThe surname is the very nature itself.\nIf you say, *\"You take the Dao as your name,\"*\ndo you truly know the Dao’s name?\nWhy such wild and groundless speculation?\n\nCould the Three Pure Ones of highest sanctity\never descend to this turbid world\nand lightly cross over the common folk?\nIt is only because you do not know your true nature.\n\nNow I shall reveal your true nature to you—\ndo you not know that all you consume\nare but the urine of *niè*?\nThis is no forced interpretation—\nobserve *\"Just leave my name instead\"*—\nwhy does it not leave a name,\nbut only speak of *\"surname\"*?\nAnd why does it not leave a surname,\nbut only say *\"true surname\"*?\n\nWhen you reach the closing line—*\"fully realized in nature\"*—\nyou will understand.\n\nThe Sage-Teachers used *\"the Great Sage leaves a name\"*\nas a hook to draw attention,\nto clarify the Dao’s true designation—\nonly the true nature itself.\n\nIn ancient times, the Divine Maiden conceived by Heaven’s grace,\nand thus the character *\"surname\"* (姓) bears the radical *\"woman\"* (女).\nFor *\"surname\"* inherently contains the marvelous Dao\nof nature’s generation and transformation.\n\nAh!\nThe surname is used to name,\nthe surname is used to represent nature,\nthe surname is used to name the Dao,\nthe surname is used to answer the call.\n\nSpoken casually, yet each word is the Dao—\nprofound, unfathomable, divine!\nWondrous!\n\nThe Master and his disciples attended court, where the Old Daoist made a report, the Great Sage gave his account, and the Village Elder presented his petition—all recounting how the Carriage-Slow Kingdom sought rain through a contest of Buddhist and Daoist magical arts. The Sage-Teachers then explained the rain-invocation method to illustrate the vast difference between heterodox and orthodox Dao. It was not merely to showcase the Great Sage’s superior technique.\n\nThe Dao, fundamentally, is one nature permeating all things, revealing the true essence while harmonizing principle and practice. It transcends all oppositions in duality, merging with all things while operating alone. It is not a technique to be confined by techniques; it is not a display to be confined by displays. One cannot grasp the Dao by clinging to manifest techniques.\n\n*\"The Daoist ascends the platform, using the talisman as his signal.\"*\nThe talisman is but wood’s qi. One sound, two sounds, three sounds, four sounds—all commands arranged through tone and color. This is true technique, yet not the true nature.\n\nThe nature’s resonance has fixed responses, but techniques’ summons are unreliable. Thus, winds, clouds, thunder, and rain sometimes answer and sometimes do not.\n\nThe Great Sage used the staff as his signal.\nThe *Ruyi Staff* embodies the complete principle of the Five Phases.\nOne finger, two fingers, three fingers, four fingers, five fingers—all applied through divine transformation. This is true nature, encompassing true technique.\n\nWhen technique empties, it becomes technique; when technique manifests, it reveals nature. Thus, winds, clouds, thunder, and rain always respond without fail.\n\nThis is what is meant by *\"stabilizing nature and preserving spirit,\"* practicing silently in meditation, with divine power operating alone—without loud incantations or displays of color.\n\nIf one speaks of technique apart from nature, it is like invoking rain through techniques alone—abandoning the root for the branches, not the true nature’s wondrous method.\n\nThus, the Wanderer says:\n*\"This is heterodox magic, not a true fruit of attainment—neither mine nor yours. If you can summon the Dragon King to appear in person,\"*\nthen true nature is revealed, motion and stillness in harmony, hidden and manifest unfathomable—neither confined to display nor bound by technique.\n\nThe Wanderer’s call brought the Dragon King swiftly to manifest his true form:\n*\"Four dragons soared through mist and cloud, dancing toward the Golden Throne Hall.\"*\nBreath and response in perfect communion—how vast and swift their operation!\n\nHow could those heterodox external arts ever steal such transformations or measure their extent?\n\nThe conclusion states:\n*\"The boundless, wondrous true method—\nthe utterly true nature shatters heterodoxy.\"*\nThis has already been made clear.\n\nIn the past, Master Lü heard Master Huanglongji’s Dharma talk. The master asked:\n*\"Who sits below?\"*\nLü replied:\n*\"A wandering Daoist of clouds and water.\"*\nThe master said:\n*\"What if the clouds disperse and the water dries up?\"*\nLü had no answer.\n\nThe master continued:\n*\"The Yellow Dragon appears.\"*\nLü suddenly awakened—realizing the Dragon’s manifestation was true nature, while refining water into gold was yet to grasp the true essence.\n\nHe left this verse:\n*\"Since first seeing the Yellow Dragon,\nI scorn my past mistaken efforts.\"*\n\nThe Wanderer’s summoning of the Dragon King after the clouds dispersed and the water dried is the same meaning.\n\nThose late learners of shallow arts, abandoning true nature for heterodoxy—how little they understand the true call!\n\n---\n**Chapter 46: External Forces Play Tricks, the Heart of the Orthodox Dao Triumphs—The Monkey King Reveals His Might and Destroys All Heresy**\n\nA disciple of enlightenment says:\nThis passage clarifies that true nature, refined a hundred times, is unbreakable, while all heterodox paths will ultimately perish.\n\nThe human body is rare—one must urgently seek a true teacher, sincerely pursue genuine learning, and never indulge in craving the strange or seeking victory. Beware of straying into heterodox paths and inviting ruin upon oneself.\n\nThe Daoist, misplaced in his arts, ashamed to admit defeat, sought to challenge seated meditation for victory in fame.\n*\"The Cloud Ladder\"*—heterodox and external.\n\nThe seated meditation school is the method of closing and stilling the breath, like forgetting all schemes and cutting off all thoughts, entering samadhi and transcending the mind. Yet, since spirit belongs to yin, it cannot yield true fruit.\n\nAncients compared it to grinding bricks to make mirrors—those beneath this level are called *\"crowd-stakes of wood.\"* Here, it is called *\"Cloud Ladder,\"* roughly meaning coiled sitting, focusing thought on the crown, gradually ascending higher, hoping to rise into the sky through false teachings—clearly the deceit of demons, a true external path!\n\nSince the Buddha has no seated form, seated Buddhas are killing Buddhas. Thus, the Wanderer says:\n*\"Speak of seated meditation, and I already concede.\nWhere is this ‘seated nature’ to be found?\"*\n\nTang Sanzang said:\n*\"In my youth, I met a mountain-dwelling Zen monk who taught that stabilizing nature and preserving spirit—even at the gates of life and death—required seated meditation for two or three years.\"*\nThis shows that seated meditation is not true Zen but idle talk from a wandering monk in his youth.\n\nNot only two or three years, but seated meditation to old age—it still avails nothing. True Zen is not confined to sitting.\n\nThe Tiger’s Strength leapt upward, and Tang Sanzang plucked him from the air—this depicts the false state of rising through thought.\n\nYet why, when struck by a great stinkbug, did he shrink his neck, and when bitten by a long centipede, did he get a nosebleed?\nThere is profound meaning here.\n\nThose deeply versed in seated meditation practice on stinking bones and cultivate stillness on poisonous hearts.\n\nThe Buddhist scriptures say:\n*\"Sitting while alive, lying while dead—\njust a stinking bone, why bother with practice?\"*\n\nThe Daoist scriptures say:\n*\"Troublesome poisonous snakes sleep in your heart.\"*\nThis is what Lü Gong tested the monk’s Zen nature with, revealing him as a small snake.\n\nAs for *\"guessing through the partition,\"* it is the art of *shèfù*—mastery of the *Liu Ren Qi Men* divination, relying on fortune-telling and conjecture. Even if one excels in such arts, it has nothing to do with the body, heart, or true nature—also an external path.\n\nInside the cabinet:\n*\"Mountains, rivers, fields, and millet—\nHeaven and Earth, geography—*\nhow did they turn into a *\"broken, discarded bell\"*?\n\n「The myriad things have no fixed essence, yet their principles align in harmony.\nThe refinement of *two* is not as precise as that of *one*,\nthe ornate is not as concise as the plain,\nthe noble is not as secure as the humble.\n\nThe new will inevitably lean toward obscurity,\nwhile the enduring cannot safeguard its transformations.\n\nThe eyes cannot be trusted,\nwisdom cannot peer into the unseen,\nand calculations cannot bind the true.\n\nThe remembrance of past reversals brings manifold omissions and illuminations,\nwhile stillness in waiting reveals no form can escape observation.\n\nDivine clarity and insight reside within the person—\nthus, the Dao of supreme sincerity\nis true knowing and genuine seeing,\nnot reliant on conjecture,\nyet capable of foresight.\n\nWhy does the *lùlù* [鹿鹿] act thus?\nIts strength is deficient, yet this is its inherent nature.\n\nAnd what of guessing the *immortal peach*?\nWhy does it become a pit?\n\nFor limbs are easily stripped away,\nwhile great fruits are never eaten—\nfalling like bubbles, only *virtue* endures.\n\nThose who glimpse with skill\nhold a complete bamboo in their chest;\nthose who strike with precision\nsee no whole ox in their gaze.\n\nThe adept do not cling to mere traces,\nperceiving the boundless *generative transformations* within;\nthe shallow only observe the surface,\nmissing the wondrous *mutual transformations* beyond.\n\nDivine luminosity moves in silence,\nchanging yet ever in flux—\ncoming and going without fixed form,\neven spirits and deities cannot fathom it.\nHence, the sage values mastery of the *Yì* [《易》].\n\nWhy does the *divine ram* [神羊] have intelligence?\nIts strength is deficient—\nis this not fitting?\n\nAnd what of guessing the *Daoist soil* [道土],\nonly to see it turn into a *monk* [和尚]?\nMarvelous, this transformation!\nThe mortal is effaced in the *void*,\nwhile the immortal and the Buddha merge as one.\n\nThe *Old Monkey* [老孙] becomes a *Daoist adept*,\nand the *Buddhist teacher* [佛师] is the *Daoist master* [道师];\nthe *Daoist novice* [道童] turns into a *Buddhist disciple*,\nfor *Daoists* are originally *Buddhist followers* [佛徒].\n\n*\"Shaving the head bare\"*—\nwhat law ever had hair?\nThe *law beyond law* surpasses all laws;\n*\"donning the yellow robe\"*—\nemptiness far outweighs mere hue,\nthe *true color* of color reaches its ultimate.\n\nThe wooden fish is struck—\nwithin, the *Yellow Court* [《黄庭》] is secretly chanted;\nthe voice *\"Āmítuó\"* [阿弥陀] is uttered—\nsplitting the spine to emerge from the world.\n\n*\"Bursting forth in unison, all chanting in harmony\"*\nis the moment of celestial blossoms descending.\n\n*\"The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao;\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal Name.\"*」\n\n\"Those who cling to names and fixed forms,\nwith eyes like a tiger’s, glaring and menacing—\nhow vulgar they are!\n\nThe tiger’s strength is but a feeble show,\nfor it is its own delusion that blinds it.\n\nThe Three Powers* [三力] fail to reflect upon their learning,\ninstead wallowing in side paths;\nhard to deceive by the true *dharma* [正法],\nyet they conjure many illusory arts,\nfoolishly hoping to achieve their ends.\n\nThe *practitioners* [行者] of such ways\nthen use their very own techniques\nto slay themselves—\nwhat purpose could they have?\n\nIn ancient times, there were those who fought\nand lost their heads yet still spoke,\n‘*Even without a head, it is fine*’ [无头亦佳],\nwho joyfully endured flaying of flesh and heart,\nor plunged into boiling caldrons like honeyed rice,\nall forged through the tempering of their original *true nature* [本真性],\ntreating the body as illusion,\nnot letting illusion ensnare the body.\n\n*Qi* [教气] may gather or disperse,\n*principle* [理] transcends gathering and dispersing;\ngrasp the *principle*, and vast *qi* [浩气] abides with it.\n\nThe form may die or live,\n*nature* [性] knows no death nor life;\nknow the *nature*, and the spirit remains unobscured.\n\nA ruler may be without *virtue* [圣] or without *non-virtue* [不圣],\nyet loyalty must never waver;\na father may be without kindness or without unkindness,\nyet filial devotion must never falter.\n\nThere are those with the spirit to master blades and fire,\nyet blades and fire do not bend nor oppress them—\nas if blades and fire were but illusions.\n\nThis is like the *practitioner*’s *Great Unity Golden Essence* [太乙金精],\nwhich has been refined through the *Eight Trigrams Furnace* [八卦炉],\na single moment of *true nature* [真性] manifesting in this way.\n\nThus, those who cultivate their *true nature*\nface great calamities or critical junctures,\nlike *Bo Qi* [伯奇] and *Xiao Si* [孝巳],\n*Bo Yi* [伯邑考] and *Shen Sheng* [申生],\nwho died for filial *virtue* [孝];\n*Guan Longfeng* [关龙逢] and *Wen Tianxiang* [文天祥],\nwhose bodies were separated yet spirits unbroken,\nakin to those who joyfully endure heart-splitting;\n*Sun Jue* [孙揆] severed by the saw,\nand *Fang Xiaoru* [方孝孺], *Tie Xuan* [铁铉],\n*Jing Qing* [景清], *Huang Zicheng* [黄子澄],\n*Lian Zining* [练子宁], who died in pieces for loyalty—\nall were wise and preserved their bodies,\nyet perfected their *true nature* [真了命],\nunharmed in any way.\n\nBut those like *Kong Guang* [孔光],\n*Hu Du* [胡度], *Su Weidao* [苏味道],\n*Chu Yuan* [褚渊], and *Feng Dao* [冯道],\nwho fled calamities to save their lives,\nthough they lived long—\nhad already lost their *true nature*,\nand thus marred their limbs in vain.\n\nThe *practitioners*’ entire *true nature* [本真性之全体]\nis not an illusion;\nit merely manifests through the body and sets forth *dharma*,\nto distinguish the true from the false.\n\nThus the summary states:\n‘*Manifest the sacred, extinguish the demonic*’ [显圣灭邪].\n\nThe head may be cut off,\nbut the *true nature*’s head cannot be severed—\n‘*still grows anew*’ [长出一个],\nyet chopping does not truly chop.\n\nThe belly may be split open,\nbut the *true nature*’s belly cannot be rent—\n‘*remains whole as before*’ [依然长合],\nyet splitting does not truly split.\n\nThe oil calamity cannot be endured,\nyet the *true nature* may be immersed—\n‘*playing in waves, defying the flames*’ [翻波顽耍],\nfor the oil calamity cannot harm the *true nature*.\n\nThe marvel lies in the passage:\n‘*The practitioner feigns death within the oil pot*’ [油锅内行者假死],\na reminder to the world:\nknow only the *true nature*’s operation—\npiercing metal, passing through stone,\nentering water yet not drowning,\nplunging into fire yet not burning;\nweapons cannot harm the body,\ntigers and rhinos cannot wound the form;\nemerging alive, vanishing unharmed—\nlife and death in perfect accord,\nnot bound by knowledge of life and death,\nnor by thoughts of gain or loss.\n\nThe moment one clings to knowledge of life and death, heart and intention,\none carries along the defilements of dust and fate—\nunable to reach this state.\n\nSan Zang’s funeral prayer reads:\n*“In life, I sought only the Dharma’s intent;\nin death, I still cherish the Buddha’s mind.”*\nThis clings to knowledge of life and death, heart and intention—\nlosing the true Way.\n\nThus, the Eight Precepts say:\n*“Master, this is not the right invocation.”*\n*“The ignorant Primal Horse Attendant”*—\nnot bound by knowledge;\n*“The damned Monkey King”*—\nnot constrained by life and death.\n\n*“The Monkey King settled the account”*—\nwhat heart remains?\n*“The Horse Attendant severed the root”*—\nwhat intention lingers?\n*“The Practitioner could not endure—\nrevealing his true form”*—\nclearly depicting a mass of true nature.\n\nFor nature knows no life and death—\nthe claim that death reveals the spirit\nis not the ultimate truth.\n\nHearing this, the Practitioner lunged, struck, and shouted:\n*“What spirit do I reveal?”*\nSpeaking of nature as the vitality of life,\nnot the spirit displayed after death.\n\nThose who study the Dao should cultivate the true nature\nwhile yet alive—\nthat is sufficient.\n\nSan Zang knew not the true nature,\nerring toward false paths.\nIn life, he practiced the illusory arts of Mao Shan—\nflaying the body, forging external cold dragons,\nsummoning rain, calling wind,\nturning gold, refining mercury,\nvainly hoping for longevity and national salvation,\npursuing the superficial while neglecting the root—\nself-deceived and deceiving others.\n\nHe knew that false learning could fool the ignorant,\nbut did not know that falsehood, prolonged, leads to ruin.\nHe knew that snares could warn the vulgar,\nbut did not know that snares, prolonged, bring destruction.\n\nThus, the Tiger’s head did not escape the dog’s jaws,\nthe deer’s entrails fed the eagles’ bellies,\nthe sheep’s bones boiled to ruin in the pot—\nthe cold dragon could not save them.\nThis is why the King wailed:\n*“Without the true transmission, do not forge the elixir—\nyour scheming mind brings no security.”*\nAnd again:\n*“What good are gold-turning and mercury refining?\nSummoning rain and calling wind—all in vain.”*\nHow profoundly he saw the truth!\n\n**Chapter Forty-Seventh**\n*The Holy Monk Blocks the Heavenly River*\n*The Golden Wood Extends Mercy to Save the Child*\n\nYu Yi Zi said:\nThe King of Car Wheel mistakenly trusted the power of the Heavenly Chariot,\nnearly losing his life.\nThanks to the Practitioner shattering the vehicle,\nthe demonic Daoist was swiftly removed,\nthe true nature preserved,\nand the land secured.\nOnce enlightened, he became a wise sage,\nknowing that the Zen gate holds the Dao—\none must not be partial.\n\n*“Honor the monk, honor the Daoist,\nnurture talent”*—\ntruly, the Three Teachings converge in one nature,\nthe boundless wisdom of the true path.\n\nNature is Heaven.\nKnowing nature is knowing—\noriginally, it is one and unbroken.\nIt is the genuine study of Heavenly Communication.\n\nThe Immortal Master feared that people would know *nature as nature*,\nyet fail to know *nature as the very essence of being*—\ndistinguishing between partial and complete, pure and mixed,\ngrasping one aspect while neglecting the whole,\nstagnant and unenlightened,\nlike one lost in darkness, blocked from progress.\nThus, he specially inscribed the three essentials of the Heavenly River,\ndepicting the Great Sage’s bamboo basket catching fish—\na marvelous metaphor to guide all ages through the mist,\nthe true Dharma-eye beyond scripture,\nthe secret essence of *Oneness Restoring to the Primordial*.\n\nIf scholars grasp this truth,\nthe nature-body returns to its source,\nand the Golden Elixir’s path is complete.\n\nYet the Heavenly Communication path is vast and unobstructed—\nfew can walk it, though all possess it inherently.\nSan Zang asked:\n*“Where shall we lodge tonight?”*\nThe Practitioner replied:\n*“At the home of a man.”*\nThe text says:\n*“A household offering alms.”*\n*“A cluster of homes appeared.”*\n*“Four or five hundred households.”*\n*“Straight to the door of a home.”*\nLater, each phrase subtly awakens the eye to *“home”*—\nusing the Chen Family Village as the skeleton,\nhinting with brushstrokes that are neither direct nor detached,\nlike ash-snake grass-thread,\nmaking readers trace and ponder endlessly.\nOnly at the closing of later chapters does its genius reveal itself—\nas in *“This supreme treasure every home possesses,\nyet fools fail to recognize it fully.”*\n\n---\n\nWhen the Master of the Three Treasures (San Zang) sought lodging from the old man,\nthe old man said:\n*“From the Eastern Land to my place,\nthere are fifty-four thousand *li* of road—\nhow could you, alone and solitary,\ntraverse such a distance?”*\n\nThe Master of the Three Treasures replied:\n*“I still have three disciples,\nwho protect this poor monk,\nand thus I have arrived here.”*\n\nIndeed, the Heavenly Communication (Tong Tian) path lies at the center of the ten-eight thousand (ten thousand eight thousand) *li*,\na Daoist path of perfect balance,\nadmitting no deviation or slightest error—\none who clings rigidly to solitary practice alone\ncould never reach it.\n\nAt this point, all hearers are astonished and perplexed,\nnone daring to accept its truth.\n\nThus, the Master of the Three Treasures called out:\n*“Disciples, come here!”*\nThe old man, seeing them, was so terrified he collapsed to the ground—\nthe source of his cries of alarm and revulsion.\n\nYet who could know that within them lay the power to subdue dragons and tame tigers?\nIt is not a matter of belief or disbelief.\n\nWhen the Master and his disciples finished their alms-keeping (zhai),\nthe old man bowed and said:\n*“You seek the Sutras (taking dharma) —\nwhy not walk the proper Dao?\nInstead, you’ve stumbled back here?”*\n\nThe Practitioner replied:\n*“We walked the proper Dao,\nbut a current of water blocked our way,\nand we could not cross.”*\n\nEach question and answer\nclearly reveals that the Heavenly Communication River (Tong Tian He)\nis the very path of Daoist cultivation,\nand arriving at Chen Family Village (Chen Jia Zhuang)\nmarks the discovery of the essential means to cross it.\n\nThough it seems not the proper path,\nin truth, it is the proper path.\n\nHe then spoke of *“Lord of the Mystic Response”* (Ling Gan Da Wang).\n*“Ling”* refers to the vital force of generation,\n*“Gan”* to the interplay of clouds and rains—\nthough sweet dew and auspicious clouds\nare sufficient to nourish all things,\nyet unrestrained indulgence\ncan still harm the true vital essence (zhenyuan).\n\nWithin grace lies destruction,\nbeneath kindness lies injury—\never consuming true yin and true yang,\nlike one who devours young boys and girls.\n\nThis metaphor speaks to its hidden subtleties—\nnot that he truly consumes young boys and girls!\n\nHence it is said:\n*“Only because you love to devour young boys and girls,\nare you not the radiant and upright deity.”*\nRather, it is the profound essence of transformation,\nthe merging of yin and yang at their utmost refinement,\nwhich cannot be superficially discerned by mere appearances.\n\nThe old man said:\n*“Our place belongs to the jurisdiction of the County of Original Assembly (Yuan Hui Xian),\nwithin the realm of the Carriage-Delay Country (Che Chi Guo),\nand is called Chen Family Village.”*\n*“Yuan”* means true vital essence (真元),\n*“Hui”* means the cyclical convergence of fate (运会) —\na ceaseless turning wheel,\na substance inherent in every home.\n\nThus, it is known that Chen Xuanzang dwells in Chen Family Village,\nand Chen Family Village contains Xuanzang—\nXuanzang does not depart from Chen Family Village,\nfor they share the same vital breath (tizong yiqi),\nnot two distinct lineages,\nnor something sought beyond the home\nwhile lost within it.\n\n*“One *Catty* of Gold”* (Yi Chèng Jīn) —\nthough its name is *young girl*,\nshe is but eight years old,\nyet holds the true yang of sixteen *catty*;\n*“Chen’s Gatekeeper”* (Chen Guan Bǎo) —\nthough its name is *young boy*,\nhe is but seven years old,\nyet embodies the true yin of fourteen *catty*.\n\n*“The rotating rites of sacrifice”* (Lúncì Jìsài) —\nplainly, it instructs each household to display its treasures;\n*“Preparing alms for the departed”* (Yù Xiū Wáng Zhāi) —\na call to cultivate the art of a virtuous death (shan si) early.\n\n*“One *Catty* of Gold”* is the standard of balanced qi and flavor;\n*“Gatekeeper”* is the beginning and end of the *Gate of the Phoenix* (Guan) and the *Heavenly Protector* (Chi).\n\nThis supreme treasure,\neven if abandoned for broken wealth,\nwhere could one purchase ten thousand *liang* of gold?\n\n*“Mysterious and responsive in essence,\nknowing greatness and smallness, beauty and ugliness,\nthe years and months of life—\nnothing can alter it.”*\n\nAh! Marvelous indeed!\n\n「*\"Guanbao\"* is the practitioner’s transformed body,\nthe practitioner becomes *Guanbao*—\nhow could there ever be two?\nOne transformation yields two,\na marvelous shift from odd to even—\nplease recognize that the *yin within yang* is **Water and Gold**.\n\n*\"Chengjin\"* is the manifestation of the Eight Precepts (Bājiè),\nthe Eight Precepts transform into *Chengjin*—\ntruly, it is as if one is eight,\n*yang generates yin*—\none must discern that the *yin within yang* is **Wood and Fire**.\n\nThese two supreme treasures resemble the **elixir essence** (dāntóu),\noriginally requiring two **elixir cauldrons** (dānwǎn).\nWhen **Gold and Wood** harmonize and dispel the *fetus* (yàozi),\nit is but the **essence of the Golden Fish**—\na single flavor.\n\nFirst consume the male, then the female—\na metaphor for two stages of practice,\nnot bound to physical form or substance,\nhow could there be harm or injury?\nThe **Golden Elixir’s** beginning and end hold true marvelous methods,\ntoo profound to utter, let alone fathom.\n\nOnce *\"造化\"* (Zàohuà) is grasped,\nits principle revealed,\nthe door is opened,\nand the male and female lifted—\nalready, the entire truth is laid bare.\nNot contrived, nor forced—\noriginally, it has no artifice.\nAll medicinal substances of *yin* and *yang* are contained here;\ndo not recklessly conjecture or stray into false paths,\nlest you weep and wail, entreating your fate in vain.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Eight**\n*Magic Whips the Cold Wind, Snow Falls in Sheets*\n*The Monk Ponders Worshipping the Buddha on Layered Ice*\n\nMaster **Wu Yi** said: *\"The Zhuangzi* states:\n‘The northern sea has a fish,\nwhich transforms into a *Peng* (peng).’\nThe fish is the *yang within yin*;\nthe northern sea belongs to **Water**—\na parable hinting at **true gold within water**.\n\nIts transformation into the *Peng* is the **Vermilion Bird** (Zhūquè).\nThe south belongs to **Fire**;\n**Nine Ten Thousand** (jiǔ wàn) of southward flight—\nthe *yang* essence has reached its peak;\n**Fire can again generate Wood**.\n\nIn summary, this endless cycle of the **Golden Fish essence** within water,\nan unceasing transformation—\nthe adept who can gather this **essence of Water and Gold**,\nwhat fear is there of not attaining **sainthood, immortality, or Buddhahood**?\n\nMany are the **lowly scholars** (xiàshì),\nnot only unwilling to deeply believe,\nbut all mocking it as **empty delusion** (□鴳).\nThey do not know this **Dao** is most urgent, most true, most near, most simple—\nabsolutely not frivolous or fantastical.\n\nThose who fail to grasp this\nare like those who have a home yet do not know where it lies,\nstill wandering in the realm of **drunken life and dreamlike death**.»\n\nThe account of the Chen Family Village gathering’s rites and sacrifices unfolds thus:\nThose who could truly believe and act upon the **Eight Precepts’** transformations\nwould proceed to Linggan Temple,\nwhere they would recognize the **golden-character spirit tablet**,\nkneel and follow its dictates—\nthis is called **clarity and purity of the master’s intent**,\ndaring not to muddle through the customary observances,\nonly then returning to their own homes.\n\nAh, the **Great Sage** and **Tianpeng** spoke:\n*\"Let us return to our own home.\"*\n*\"Where is your home?\"*\n*\"To sleep at Old Chen’s place.\"*\n*\"Fool! You’re babbling again.\"*\n*\"You call me a fool! Just teasing him—why take it seriously?\"*\n*\"To be fully human is to begin and end with sincerity.\"*\nEach knock met its response,\nmutual revelation stirring even the wanderer abroad\nto yearn for his homeland,\nthe exile in distant lands\nto tighten the reins of return.\n\nEvery home has its own home—\ndo not lodge in another’s.\nEvery home still has its own—\ndo not dream of another’s as your own.\nTo cease being a fool,\nto jest and pass through—\nthat is true.\nTo speak nonsense yet begin and end with sincerity—\nthat is enlightenment.\n\nThe striking of the gong\nresonates clear and piercing—\nhow much more than the evening drum and morning bell\nto awaken the lost from slumber!\n\nThe **Pilgrim’s** exchange with the monster\nmerely reveals an old household custom.\n\nWhen the **Eight Rules** manifested as a monster,\nit had already found two **heaven-piercing giant scales**.\nHaving traced its path,\nthere was a method to capture it.\n\nReturning to Chen’s home,\nall were unharmed—\nhosts and guests, masters and disciples—\nunited in joyful conversation, their delight evident.\n\nThe **Water’s gold** harbors **true yin and true yang**,\nthe **qi of the Five Phases and Four Seasons**.\nIt was originally Chen’s own possession,\nyet not yet subdued.\n\nThe fish leaps in the deep—\nthe **Dao** reveals itself naturally.\n\nThe **Dao** is the **Dao**; I return to myself—\nno entanglement with it.\nI am confined within the **Dao**,\nyet the **Dao** plays with me.\n\nBirth, old age, sickness, death—\narising, dwelling, subsiding, emptiness—\nall stem from the **Dao**.\n\nThe child of **creation** acts without intent;\n**Tang Seng** seeks the **Sutra** with desperate urgency.\nTo strive against **creation’s flow**,\nto contend and oppose—\nthis is the **Water’s gold**, not yet tamed,\nand so it harbors the impulse to torment **Tang Seng**,\nfor **Tang Seng’s** own urgent, self-driven pursuit is its cause.\n\nAh, the **compassionate heart** of the **Carp Grandmother**,\nsaving **Tang Seng** from the monster,\ndemonstrating the **good method** of refining the **restless mind**.\n\nIf one sees this as aiding demons in cruelty,\nit is to cling to literal forms,\nnot to grasp the author’s intent—\nhow can one fathom the **Heart Sutra’s** profundity?\n\nThe **Heart Sutra’s** marvel lies in **non-attachment**.\nA mind fixed on objects is not the **wonderful mind**.\nOnce, a **wild fox** disguised as a woman\ncould discern where a man’s mind dwelled—\nfor the mind was fixed upon something.\n\n**Master Daan** placed his mind in the **Four Fruitions of Arhat**,\nyet the fox could not find it.\nI say: the fox was merely a fox—\nthe mind that sought was its own fixation;\nhow could it search everywhere and fail?\n\nI knew it through the very mind that sought.\nWhat mind of mine knew it?\n\nThe **Tang Seng**’s mind to retrieve the scriptures was most urgent—urgent in his progress, unaware of retreat or survival, each with its own signs. How could he know that opposing the **Dao**’s natural unfolding only brings harm to himself?\n\nThe **Guanpo** said, *“I have long known that Your Majesty has the **Dao**-transcending power to summon winds and call rains, to churn the seas and overturn rivers.”*\n\nWhen **Tang Seng** reached the riverbank, seeing the winds stilled and waves calm, he sought a flat-bottomed boat and crossed in an instant. Yet once in midstream, the **Dao**’s power and **qi** manifested—unexpected, swift, and decisive. Why resort to crude tactics of whipping winds, summoning snow, or freezing ice to ensnare him?\n\nTo stir winds and summon snow, to freeze the river—was it not to deliberately obstruct him, preventing swift passage and thus thwarting his **Dao**-transcending power? To make the crossing treacherous, forcing caution and thus dampening his **qi** and power? Was this not the **good method** of saving the monk and subduing the demon?\n\nWhen the great snow fell and the ice grew bitterly cold, the cold penetrated to the core, and the plum blossoms bloomed in response. When faced with the extraordinary, strategy revived—thus, the extreme of cold births harmony, and the most blocked paths open. Without enduring severe cold, one cannot refine the true nature.\n\nEight hundred layers of ice—this was the most perilous path. To brave danger was to fall into traps; to recognize peril was to walk with caution. Thus, one who treads on a tiger’s tail receives its bite, and one who steps on frost knows its threat. Without plunging into the deepest abyss, one cannot still the restless mind.\n\n**Guanpo** had long understood **Tang Seng**’s impulsive, restless nature. Precisely because this was the **Dao**-aligned path to heaven, she devised this trial—to temper his nature with cold and still his mind with the abyss. Was she not perhaps the very embodiment of the Great Earth?\n\nHow do we know this? Observe how the **Great Sage Equaling Heaven** did not wait for the **Journeyer’s** report but rushed to the bamboo grove to forge weapons. **Guanpo** was the **Great Sage**—when the **Great Sage** captured the fish, **Guanpo** was not present. The **Great Sage** was **Guanpo**. Every word and deed of **Guanpo** served only to protect **Tang Seng** and aid the **King of the River**.\n\nIt is clear: the **Spirit-Sensing King** is but a **Spirit-Sensing Bodhisattva**. The title remains, yet the **King** is transformed by a **Bodhisattva**. Then the **King’s** winds, his great snows, his manipulation of **Tang Seng**—were they not **Guanpo’s** manipulation of the **King** and **Tang Seng**, all of it the **Great Sage’s** manipulation of the **King** and **Tang Seng**, all in accordance with the Buddha’s will to guide the scripture-seeker?\n\n**San Zang** said, *“This season is strange—I do not know if it is spring, summer, autumn, or winter.”* He saw that the **Dao** of heaven follows its natural course, and one must know its signs.\n\nAgain, he said, *“I did not know of the mountains and rivers’ dangers.”* He saw that the **Dao** of earth follows fixed principles, and one must know its changes.\n\nAgain, he said, *“In this world, nothing is heavier than name and profit. Others risk death for gain; my disciple serves the edict with loyalty—yet it is still for fame. How does this differ?”* He saw that greed for profit and fame are burdens, and one must know their harm.\n\nIf the restless mind is indulged, if one treads carelessly upon the layered ice, then one becomes a plaything of fate for eternity, unable to be a master of one’s own life. Thus, one must penetrate the **yin-yang**, deeply understand the times, know when to advance and retreat, guard against danger and foresee risk, abandon schemes and sever thoughts, still the form and rest the mind—only then can one remain true to the **Way**.\n\nIf one rushes forward in haste, it is as if one has passed the mark. The **Way** lies before you, yet you stumble past it. **Sha Wujing’s** words, *“In haste, one fears mistakes,”* are a sharp warning.\n\nThe **River of Heaven’s Passage** is the true path to retrieve the scriptures. The monsters within have not yet been subdued—how can one cross? The **gold in water** is the **Dao**’s marvel—true gold has not yet been obtained, and without it, there is no way to worship the Buddha.\n\nThe scriptures are the **gold in water**, not mere words. The Buddha is present in the world, not only in the Western Paradise. To seek the Buddha while recklessly risking danger—why not stay at Chen’s house to avoid error?\n\nThe **grass-shoe horse** was hasty; to walk on ice was reckless. To step into the abyss and sink to the depths—**Tang Seng** brought this upon himself. What blame is there for the monster?\n\n**Guanpo** said, *“I dare not! I dare not!”*\n\nFor now, let him be. Better to endure two days, leisurely and at ease, enjoying oneself.\n\nHow reverent, cautious, and composed! Not only does this spare Tang Seng harm, but it also allows the monster to be contained, opens the door for the three disciples to rescue the drowning, and preserves the Great Sage’s ground for subduing demons. Who else but an embodiment of effortless transformation could do this?\n\nThe three disciples returned to Chen’s village and explained the spirit’s trickery. They headed straight to the water’s edge to seek their master and capture the monster—the moment of returning to origin and restoring essence lies here.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Nine: The Monk Faces Calamity and Sinks into a Watery Abode—Guan Yin Appears in a Fish Basket to Save the Peril**\n\nWu Yi Zi said: *Gold elixir* is the convergence of true yin and true yang qi, following the natural cycles of Heaven and Earth through the four seasons and seventy-two solar terms, returning to the primal origin without artificial coercion. Only when one penetrates Lao Zi’s subtle and wondrous teachings does one realize the Dao’s simplicity and effortless ease—taking and consuming it grants fulfillment of nature and life, instantly ascending to sainthood.\n\nThis passage reveals the marvelous application of subduing the gold elixir, the secret essence of Guan Yin’s mission to Chang’an to relieve suffering and save from peril, marking the grand source and culmination of *The Scripture of Liberation from Calamity*. Its placement in the forty-ninth chapter underscores the *Great Correlation*’s number of fifty, with its full use manifesting in forty-nine—here lies its significance.\n\nThe immortal’s brush cannot fully convey its depth, so only Guan Yin’s miraculous fish-basket form is depicted to illuminate later generations. Its profound implications are boundless, encompassing all phenomena—only those who master yin-yang and comprehend the workings of creation can glimpse its essence. To say *Journey to the West* lacks ingenuity, relying solely on invoking the Southern Sea Bodhisattva in crises, is as blind as groping for a *zheng* (上“竹”下“龠”) in the dark.\n\nThe second disciple devised a plan to descend into the water to seek their master. When Zhu Bajie carried the real and false bodies of the disciple, it signified their shared resolve—urgent need to question a friend and seek their master. How could one not recognize another’s true form when there are forms beyond the body?\n\n*\"I’m right here, Old Monkey!\"*\nBut calling to the deaf awakens no fool—*\"You’re still carrying me!\"*\nAt the sound of the song, your original form remains.\n\n*Hurry, hurry—no delay!*\nLift your head—this is the Water Turtle’s domain.\n\nTransformed into Shrimp Mother, question Shrimp Grandma—\nThe Great-Bellied One speaks of vitality;\nEncounter Stone Lizi, listen to Stone Xiang—\nThe Living Tomb’s true master weeps over the path to death.\n\nIf the disciples could find their master together, what fear is there that the true scriptures won’t reach home?\n\nThe monk wept in grief, recounting the watery disaster—not out of hatred for water, but acknowledging that from birth to return to the source, water’s role is indispensable, never to be overlooked.\n\nThe disciple called out: *\"Master, do not grieve over the watery calamity. The scriptures say: ‘Earth is the mother of the Five Phases; wood is the source of the Five Phases. Without earth, nothing grows; without water, nothing thrives.’\"* This echoes the meaning: *\"The Four Symbols and Five Phases rely entirely on earth; the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams cannot depart from it.\"* The point is clear—no need for further annotation.\n\nHaving clarified the situation, the disciple ordered Zhu Bajie and Sha Wujing to enter the water to fight separately—why? The monster is the *true gold in water*, a convergence of yin-yang and the Five Phases’ qi, already formed. Yet, obstructed by the talisman’s solar fire, its time has not come, so it cannot return to origin and attain its true fruition. Only Zhu Bajie’s wood-fire refinement and Sha Wujing’s true earth can subdue it.\n\n*\"Wielding a nine-pronged red copper mallet\"*—a symbol of pure yang, standing alone and unyielding.\n\nZhu Bajie said: *\"You fake being the Spirit King of Illusions, devouring children in Chen’s village! I’m Chen Qing’s one-catty gold—don’t you recognize me?\"*\nNot to make the king recognize him, but to let those refining the elixir do so.\n\nAt this moment, only a female form appears—no mention of boys. Beneath the water, a fierce battle unfolds among the three. Do not mistake this for the initial convergence of the Five Phases forming the embryo—this is the later stage of ten-month fire refinement after the embryo is formed.\n\nThe verse reads: *\"With fate and affinity, the Dao is complete\"*—yin-yang union.\n*\"Mutual generation and conquest, as countless as grains of sand\"*—fire refinement.\n*\"Earth conquers water; water dries up to the bottom\"*—water solidifies with earth.\n*\"Water generates wood; wood flourishes in blossom\"*—wood thrives with water.\n\nIn Chan practice, this merges into unity;\nIn elixir refinement, the three families are distinctly subdued.\n*\"Earth is the mother, sprouting golden buds—\nGolden water births the infant\"*—earth generates gold and water.\n*\"Water is the root, nourishing wooden flowers—\nWood radiates fiery splendor\"*—wood and fire refine the gold.\n*\"The Five Phases converge yet remain distinct—\nThus the faces change, each contending differently\"*—\nDuring refinement, though still converging, the fire’s intensity shifts constantly, each phase distinct—hence the monk’s battle with the monster involves ever-changing forms.\n\nTo read this verse merely as Five Phases generation-conquest rhetoric misses its profundity.\n\n*\"The two feigned defeat, luring it out to battle.\"*\n\nThe refining is yet incomplete—\nAgain it is quenched in water.\n*\"The fire’s power is insufficient; it cannot yet be subdued.\"*\n\n*\"The two return to challenge it\"*—\nThe fire’s power advances once more.\n\nThe **Taoist** crone addressed the Great Sage:\n*\"The Great Sage of Heavenly Contention, born from the primordial unity of the Hunyuan Dao,\nRefined in the Eight Trigram Furnace as the Golden Elixir Immortal,\nNow submits to the Buddhist teaching.\nOh Great King, henceforth do not battle with him again!\"*\n\nShe extolled the Great Sage’s origins,\nRevealing that his elixir was forged from the **Hunyuan Dao**—\nThe **Hunyuan Dao** being the unity of **qi**,\nRefined in the Eight Trigram Furnace.\nWhen the fire’s power was perfected,\nHe must retreat and guard himself,\nWaiting for the moment of **Dao**’s completion and transcendence.\n\nThis is as the **Cui Gong**’s *\"Mirror of Entering the Medicine\"* says:\n*\"Receive **qi** auspiciously, guard against perilous omens;\nWhen the fire’s intensity is complete, do not harm the elixir;\nHeaven and Earth’s essence refined—transformation is parsimonious.\"*\n\nThus the subsequent verses of the demon:\n*\"My noble sister’s vision is profound—\nTightly bar the gates!\"*\n*\"Let any who call outside remain—\nThe gates shall never open!\"*\n\nThe Pilgrim said:\n*\"You two must patrol the riverbank,\nLest he escape!\"*\nAll were tactics of halting refinement and fortifying defenses,\nGuarding against dangers and calamities,\nFearful of the *\"midnight storm and thunder\"* disaster.\n\n**Danyang** Master spoke:\n*\"Fire in water rises, yet the mind must not be stirred;\nFlowers bloom in snow—let the will extinguish the spring.\"*\nThis was when the monster had fortified its ramparts in layers,\nSealing the gates and refusing to emerge.\nThe **Dao**’s nature returns to its true essence—\nA spontaneous, wondrous stillness.\nThe **Bodhisattva** of **Potalaka** moves with effortless grace—\nNot awaiting the Pilgrim’s obeisance,\n*\"No one is permitted to attend—\nShe enters the bamboo grove to observe and play.\"*\n\nHad the **Bodhisattva** known the demon would be subdued,\nShe would have prepared the instruments of capture beforehand,\nTo display their marvelous efficacy in **shen guan** [神观, divine observation].\nThis is not something to be shared with all.\n\nThe Great Sage then:\n*\"Let me sit for a moment,\nAwaiting the Bodhisattva’s emergence.\"*\nSince the time was not yet ripe,\nHe must patiently wait—\nNo need to agitate his restless mind.\n\nWhen the **Red Boy** laughed:\n*\"In those days, your demonic passions clouded your heart,\nBut today you have attained the fruit of enlightenment—\nOnly now do you recognize my true goodness.\"*\n\nThis clearly marks the moment when the **Red Boy** revealed his true form.\nToday’s demons, like the **Red Boy**,\nCannot achieve enlightenment without the **Bodhisattva**’s **Dao**-power and divine skill.\nThough the principle of **Dao** is one—\nTo transcend the self and attain liberation—\nThe timing of their subjugation varies.\n\nThe Pilgrim’s heart burned with anxiety,\nFearful that delay would endanger his master’s life.\nYet time passed, and the elixir escaped its vessel—\nHis life was lost.\n\n*\"The Bodhisattva instructed,\n‘Wait only for his own emergence.’\"*\nThis refers to the elixir’s moment of **tui tai** [脱胎, transformation],\nWhen it must be allowed to rise naturally.\n\nDescribing the **Bodhisattva**’s divine play in the bamboo grove—\nAll was effortless, unforced grace,\nNo artifice or pretense,\nRevealing both male and female in one form,\nDistinguishing purity from defilement.\nAmidst the haste, she moved with perfect ease—\nWithin **zuo wang** [坐忘, seated oblivion], all was order.\nThe instruments of **shen guan** were truly profound,\nAs the **Ganlu** [甘露, sweet dew] of compassion fell upon the azure void.\n\nAh! How wondrous!\n\nThe River of Heaven’s demon’s root—\nOnly the Bodhisattva perceives its source;\nIn the bamboo grove, she strips the wicker—\nWhat could the celestial hosts ever know?\n\nTo restore her household, few things she needs—\nA single hand lifts a purple bamboo basket;\nTo rescue Tang Seng, time must not be lost—\nNo fetters bind the one who robes and sits.\n\nUnadorned, the Bodhisattva appears,\nYet like a midwife pressed by urgent birth;\nThe basket tied at the stream’s head,\nPlainly the fisherman against the current’s pull.\n\nThe Bodhisattva chants:\n*\"The dead depart, the living abide!\nThe dead depart, the living abide!\"*\nDivine! Divine!\nThe mechanism of life and death lies in her grasp—\nHer secret technique, passed only by word of mouth,\nIts wondrous inversion beyond speech.\nYet in shallow terms:\n*\"Abide\"*—the essence of humanity,\nWhere heart-sprout and kidney-qi entwine,\nThus life is formed; entering my *\"Gate\"* is *\"obstruction.\"*\n*\"Depart\"*—the loss of unity,\nWhere the Seven Emotions and malevolent intent persist,\nThus death is sealed; when the *\"ruin\"* comes, it must *\"perish.\"*\n\nThe living—this is *shen* [神, spirit],\nQi refined, ascending and abiding,\nOne’s attainment yields perfection,\nDetached from humanity, self-sustaining—\nIts abiding is its own, not the Bodhisattva’s.\n\nThe dead—this is *wu* [物, matter],\nSubstance impure, descending and departing,\nTouch water, it breaks the law;\nMeet the blade, it meets its fate—\nIts departure is its own, not the Bodhisattva’s.\n\nThe *Sutra* says:\n*\"The Bodhisattva, in the Dharma, should dwell nowhere.\"*\nYet now it says *\"abide\"*—\nLife arises from the living,\nThe living is without abiding, yet abiding arises from the living.\nDeparture stems from death,\nDeath is abiding itself—\nThus abiding leads to departure.\nThe chant’s manifest meaning is clear,\nBut its hidden marvels cannot be put to paper.\n\n*\"A radiant golden fish\"*—\nSuddenly enters the basket,\nOnly the Bodhisattva’s divine perception could mark its moment.\n\nWhat intent does the Bodhisattva hold?\nTracing its origin, born from the lotus, unstained;\nExamining her method, from the Nine Transformations, returning to One.\n\nThe *\"tides surging from the sea\"*—\nRevealing the cause and conditions of its descent into the world as a spirit;\n\n*\"Counting the fingers, tracing the lines\"*—\nCalculating the time of its return to the origin.\n\n*\"Performing divine arts, weaving a bamboo basket, capturing the marvelous manifestation\"*—\nTo show the common folk the vast compassion and great mercy—\nFor the divine response is such that the King is indeed the embodiment of a Great Sage.\n\nAs the *Sutra* states:\n*\"Guanyin Bodhisattva accomplishes such virtues,\nTaking countless forms to traverse the lands,\nRescuing and liberating all beings.\"*\n\nThe Great Sage obtained the Dragon Girl and the Red Boy,\nRevealing the true source of inherent nature;\nThe King obtained the boy and girl,\nManifesting the roots of life itself.\n\nOne and two are the same.\n\nThe people of Chenjiazhuang who hold faith—\nEach household has its own divine-response Great Sage,\nAnd the wondrous forms of the fish basket\nNaturally possess the methods to subdue the divine-response King.\nYet why do they not revere and honor them with faith?\n\nWhen the King is captured in the basket,\nTang Seng’s life is already saved,\nThe old turtle returns to its original abode and returns to the origin—\nThis is the completion of the Heavenly Passage and the Universal Salvation Boat.\nWhy bother with building ships or preparing oars?\n\n*\"Suddenly a loud cry from the river\"*—\nFrom *\"knowing enlightenment is inherently divine,\"*\n*\"It is truly real—*\n*How dare it be false?\"*\n\nCrossing with a steady heart over ice thicker than layers—\n*\"A slight tilt, and the fruit of enlightenment is lost\";*\nStepping on the lid, standing firm on either side—\nLeading the horse upward, it is indeed the *River Diagram*.\n\nAh!\n\nThe turtle’s back emits a five-colored radiant light;\nWithin the Heavenly Passage, all mysteries of the formless are spoken.\n\nReturning to the origin, it relies entirely on spontaneity;\nShedding its shell to become true, one must inquire of the Buddha and Ancestors.\n\nAble to board the bottomless ship—\nFor here lies the root of divine essence planted.\nObtaining the scripture of written truth,\nOne must still traverse the *River Diagram*’s path.\n\nSolemnly sworn to Heaven, not a word amiss—\nI ask, I ask, do not forget.\n\n---\n**Fifty-First Chapter**\n*Emotions Stirred by Lust, Nature Lost to Desire*\n*The Godhead Dimmed, the Heart Bewildered by Demons*\n\nMaster Yu-yi of Enlightenment says: *The Journey to the West* expounds the Dao of the Golden Elixir, focusing solely on the two characters **\"性\" (nature/essence)** and **\"命\" (life/principle)**, which are in truth the original, true *qi* of the primal heavens.\n\nThose who cultivate nature and life cultivate this single *qi*; when nature and life are both perfected, they return to unity.\nRevolving endlessly, transforming in myriad ways, yet never departing from their source.\n\nVarious treatises establish doctrines:\nSome first clarify nature, then life;\nOthers first clarify life, then nature.\nSome say clarifying nature is the same as clarifying life,\nOr that clarifying life is the same as clarifying nature.\nSome emphasize nature alone, yet life holds no separate principle;\nOthers emphasize life alone, yet nature shares the same origin.\nSome clarify nature but fail to grasp life’s subtlety,\nOr clarify life but miss nature’s essence.\nSome first grasp life, then later grasp nature,\nOr first grasp nature, then later grasp life.\nSome, failing to grasp nature, fall into emptiness and deceit,\nOr, failing to grasp life, stray into demonic delusion.\nSome, through false paths, fail to grasp life and lose their nature;\nOthers, through barren stillness, fail to grasp nature and cannot grasp life.\nSome, led astray by material desires, fail to grasp nature;\nOthers, misled by illusions, fail to grasp life.\nSome, not fully knowing nature’s beginning, cannot grasp it;\nOthers, not fully knowing life’s mysteries, cannot grasp it.\n\nSome speak directly, some speak in reverse,\nSome convey meaning through metaphor, some through symbols.\nSome jest or indulge in idle musings to reveal inherent truth;\nOthers use cold, subtle words to demonstrate foundational practice.\nSome hint at the essential keys,\nOthers openly reveal the true transmission.\n\nWhether oblique or direct, indirect or allegorical.\n\nThe myriad demons may wield strange arts,\nYet all still revolve around refining **\"性命\"** (nature and life),\nOr cultivating the **先天真乙之氣** (primal Daoist *qi* of the original Yang).\n\nThe first seven chapters follow a natural order.\nLater ones, either ordered or without sequence,\nAre inverted and rearranged—each chapter holds profound meaning.\nLike the **造化** (Cosmic Transformation) carving all things,\nNo repetition exists; all ultimately stem from the **一元** (monarchal unity).\n\nThe *Paramartha Contract* says: *\"孔窍其門\"* (its gate is narrow and secret).\nZiyu Master says: *\"引而不發\"* (draw but do not release).\nOnly those who read well can **神觀默察** (divinely perceive and silently observe)\nAnd thereby attain self-realization.\n\nIf a chapter’s teaching shifts with circumstance,\nUnable to **安身立命** (settle oneself and establish one’s nature),\nThen it is the *Yijing*’s *\"思出其位\"* (thinking beyond one’s station),\nAnd the *Zhongyong*’s *\"不能素位而願外\"* (unable to abide in one’s inherent station yet craving the external).\nAll stems from **操守不固** (unstable moral discipline)\nAnd **工夫未到** (unfulfilled practice).\n\nThe opening lines of *\"Nán Kē Zǐ\"* (The Southern Slope’s Child) reveal\nA **心地工夫** (heart-mind cultivation) that is continuous and unbroken,\nEvery word piercing to the core.\nWhy single out *\"南柯\"* (Southern Slope)?\nBecause the world’s treacherous paths are **幻如南柯** (illusions like the Southern Slope).\nIf one’s heart clings to desires,\nUnable to **隨遇而安** (adapt with equanimity),\nFlitting from one place to another,\nThen it is akin to being caught in a *Nán Kē* dream.\n\nWhat is hardest for mortals to endure?\nNothing surpasses **饥欲** (hunger and craving),\nAnd what most easily disturbs them?\n**饥寒而思衣食** (hunger and cold, pondering food and garments).\nIn the text, the master and disciple share harmony of heart and unity of intent,\nPursuing truth and returning to the right path—\nThus refining nature and life.\n\nShould hunger or cold arise,\nOne must **固穷** (embrace poverty with resolve),\nNot recklessly act.\nThe Three Treasures (三藏) see the **楼台** (palatial halls) and desire to take alms,\nThe practitioner gazes at the **气色** (aura) and urges them not to enter,\nConveying the warning:\n*\"Do not knock at the gates of the mighty for gain,\"*\n*\"Beware the ice-slick slopes and tread with caution.\"*\n*\"Dismount, sit level on the ground,\nDo not stir your body.\nGrant you a method to settle—\nDraw a circle, charge you not to step beyond,\nAnd steadfastly remain within.\nThis is **素位而行** (to move from one’s inherent station),\nNot craving the external.\nThis is called **有坐性** (having settled nature),\nNot merely tracing a circle like the *Yùzhàng Shù* (Jade Canopy Technique).\n\nHaving settled nature or lacking it—\nNot in the sitting, but in the station.\nTo move from one’s inherent station is **有坐性** (having settled nature),\nNot straying outside the circle.\nOnce one craves the external,\nThe settled station is lost—\nThough one sits the whole day in stupor,\nIt is still **無坐性** (lacking settled nature),\nHaving stepped beyond the circle.\n\nTo dwell in wealth as though it were none—**有坐性**.\nTo endure poverty as though it were fixed—**有坐性**.\nTo face calamity as though it were trivial—**有坐性**.\nTo meet circumstances with ease,\nContent and unperturbed,\nEven without sitting, one sits.\nYet if the mind is restless,\nTurned by external influences,\nThen one has **性** (nature) and lacks **性** (nature).\n\nTo step outside this circle\nIs to enter another—\nAs if trapped in the **罟獲陷阱** (nets and snares),\nYet unaware of how to avoid them.\n\nMaster and disciple both sit composed,\nThe practitioner does not shun a thousand *li* journey,\nServing the master with alms—\nThis is duty within the circle,\nNot craving the external.\n*\"Until ancient trees rise to the heavens,\nA village of dwellings is reached.\"*\n\nThe gate of brushwood creaked as an elder emerged, dragging a staff of *lú* (藜) and gazing upward to the heavens, proclaiming:\n**\"The northwest wind rises—tomorrow shall be clear!\"**\n\nA scruffy hound dashed forth from behind him.\n\nThen he spoke again:\n**\"You’ve strayed from the path.\nThe Western Heaven’s way lies straight north ahead.\"**\n\nBut in his heart, fear struck him:\n**\"This monk is a ghost! A ghost!\"**\n\nThen he raised his staff to strike, and the Wayfarer replied:\n**\"Old one, no matter how you strike,\nJust remember the tally of your blows—\nOne staff for one *shēng* (升) of rice,\nSlowly measured out.\"**\n\nHearing this, the elder slammed the gate shut,\nShouting only: **\"There’s a ghost! A ghost!\"**\n\nThe Wayfarer said:\n**\"The Dao transforms the virtuous, and the virtuous release the foolish.\"**\n\nWith a hidden-body technique, he took a bowl of dry rice and returned.\n\nAh! How wondrous!\nThe Immortal Master’s parable is profound and veiled—\nUnfathomable to the reader.\nCommon folk might think it merely depicts\nA barking village dog and a miserly old man,\nBut who would know it’s a covert censure\nOf those in high station who secretly hoard wealth,\nPretending to discern the *tian shi* (天时) and perceive human affairs,\nRelying on their power to gauge the winds of fortune—\nTruly, they are men of **shàng kuì fǔ zuò** (仰愧俯怍),\nWho have stepped beyond the circle of **tian zuòxìng** (天坐性),\nLikely akin to the *Mǎng Dàfū* (莽大夫) of the *Gāng Mù Shū* (纲目书).\n\nHow do we see this?\n**\"Ancient trees reaching to the heavens\"**—\nIs this not dwelling in the *Mù Tiān* (木天, the realm of wood)?\n**\"Dragging a staff of *lú* (藜)\"**—\nIs this not the *Tài Yǐ Zhàng* (太乙杖, the staff of the Supreme Unity), a *lú* staff?\n**\"Village dwellings and brushwood gates\"**—\nIs this not wandering in the wilds?\n**\"Gazing to the heavens and spotting a scruffy hound\"**—\nIs this not observing the winds while clinging to survival,\nAnd feeling shame before the heavens?\n\n**\"You’ve strayed from the path—\nThe Western Heaven’s way lies straight north ahead.\"**\nNot knowing his own error in facing south,\nYet instructing others of their westward deviation—\nHis heart is filled with shame,\nHence he cries: **\"A ghost! A ghost!\"**\nIf his mind clings to ghosts,\nIs this not shame before humanity?\n\n**\"The elder raises his staff to strike.\nThe Wayfarer says: ‘Old one,\nJust remember the tally of your blows—\nOne staff for one *shēng* (升) of rice.’\"**\nIndeed, he relies only on records to predict promotions,\nKnowing nothing beyond his own stolen gains and self-satisfied sustenance—\nHis heart is filled with shame,\nHence he cries: **\"A ghost! A ghost!\"**\nWhen he reflects on his deeds,\nHow could he not shame himself to death?\n\nThe Eight Precepts say:\n**\"I am not like that uncouth man,\"**\nAnd thus marks his own kind.\n\nThis man is neither virtuous nor foolish—\nThe Dao cannot transform him,\nAnd the teachings cannot release him.\n\nSuch wretched souls—ashamed above, abashed below—\nThough they hold office yet step beyond their station,\nTheir words betray their hearts, their deeds betray their speech,\nClear villains indeed! Better far were those who hide their faces,\nScratching for scraps to feed their parents, serve their masters,\nYet show the utmost reverence and respect.\n\nThe Sage’s words are not idle—\nHe stirs the spirit of loyal ministers,\nSets a warning for all who bear office,\nJust as Mencius’ parable of the Qi man:\nThe wise man knows his own worth,\nThe fool knows his own folly—\nThus the noble refuse the taste of others’ fat and grain.\n\nTang Seng, bewildered by the fool’s tale of prison,\nAll left their circle together,\nSitting at the gates of princes and nobles,\nSilent as a ghost’s lair, with no trace of man—\nNot that there were none, but only beggars in the dead of night,\nLiving like ghosts in a tomb.\n\nThe fool entered and saw:\nSilken curtains, ivory beds—\nA heap of white bones, gaunt and shriveled.\nTo see one of noble rank yet neglect his nature and life—\nThe clear-eyed see only a pile of bones.\n\nThe fool wept and sighed:\n*\"Where now are the heroes and the bold?\"*\nA saying to stir the soul to wakefulness.\n\n*\"A flicker of lamplight in the tent\"*—\nThe fleeting nature of life, like a spark soon gone.\n*\"Silken robes on the table\"*—\nThe allure of purple and gold.\n*\"No matter right or wrong, he takes off his robe\"*—\nThe shamelessness of office.\n*\"No one around—who could know?\"*—\nThe fearlessness of the four watchful senses.\n*\"He stands unsteady, then crashes to the ground\"*—\nThe fickleness of honor and disgrace.\n*\"He binds his own hands behind his back\"*—\nThe ease with which one falls into the law’s snare.\n\nTang Seng, driven by hunger, left the circle and roused the demon.\nThe fool, clinging to warmth, fell into its trap—\nAll because desire clouded their nature, their passions unchecked,\nTheir ruin self-wrought. What blame to the demon?\n\nThus those who cultivate the Dao’s natural worth\nRefuse the trappings of rank and finery.\n\nThe Pilgrim returned to the circle for food,\nFound no one, no horses—\nLooked back, and the towers had turned to jagged rocks.\nThe yellow millet still unripe, all changed in an instant—\nThe sea becomes land, land becomes sea—\nTruly worthy of lament and song!\n\nAll because they could not steadfastly preserve their nature,\nDared to leave the circle, greedy for warmth and ease—\nHow could they not stray from the path,\nStumble into the jaws of demons?\n\nThe old man pointed to *\"The Golden Cangshan Cave, where the One-Horned Rhinoceros King reigns.\"*\nThe *cang* is a helmet, armor for battle.\nThe rhinoceros with a single horn is *kàng*—\nThe king with a single horn is *zhǔ*—\nOne who steps beyond his station, restless and defiant,\nA rebel lord, like the ancient *Huandou* of old.\n\nThus the tale begins with the master and disciples on their proper path,\nThen suddenly a great mountain appears,\nIts peaks towering, its ridges sharp—\nSan Zang holds the reins tight.\n\nThe lofty peaks contrast with the towering mountain,\nThe *cang* (helmet) echoes *Huandou*’s defiance.\nNow the *\"Cang\"* character appears—\nHiding *Huandou* within the mountain’s grandeur.\n\n*Huandou* aided *Gonggong* in rebellion,\nRavaging the age of sage rule—\nThe ultimate rebel, the most transgressive.\nThe Sage likens the demon to this ancient traitor.\n\nThe old man revealed himself as mountain god and earth spirit,\nAccepted the alms bowl,\n*\"Wait until I rescue Tang Seng,\nThen I will serve Tang Seng—\nTo show the Great Sage’s utmost reverence and filial piety.\"*\nThe mountain god does not overstep, does not accept improperly,\nProving the Great Sage’s respect is his due.\n\nThe Great Sage searched for the demon’s lair to battle,\nThe demon, hearing this, rejoiced:\n*\"Since leaving my palace,\nI have not yet tested my skills.\"*\n\nHis joy was seized—\nThe *cang* (helmet) of defiance, restless and impulsive—\nNot to be overcome by mere movement.\n\nThe Pilgrim, unable to win, grew frantic,\nLifted his *Jin’gu* Staff and split it into thousands of strands—\nThus, movement only fuels more movement,\nAnd the more he stirs, the deeper he falls.\n\nThe demon’s trap was set by movement itself—\nThe old demon took the circle and bound the *Jin’gu* Staff,\nAll reduced to motion.\n\nBut motion cannot be contained—\nAll because the first impulse came from within.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Dao rises one foot, yet the measure stretches ten—\nNature disordered, passions clouded, home misjudged.\nAlas, the Dharma-body has no seat—\nAt that moment, the moving thought was wrong.\"*\n\nThe Fifth Volume:\n*The Monkey King’s Empty Schemes*\n*Fire and Water Fail to Forge the Demon*\n\nMaster Wu Yi said: The rhinoceros is *chǒu*—\nEarth of the ugly trigrams, in man it is *yì* (intent).\nWhen intent runs wild with no restraint,\nThe heart follows, turning with no master—\nLosing its grip, it forgets the principle,\nAnd the *Jin’gu* Staff is bound away.\n\n*\"The Great Sage stood empty-handed, weeping:\n‘Who would have thought my staff was lost?’\"*\nMeaning he had lost his resolve.\n\nMan can master intent to overcome Heaven,\nBut Heaven cannot force intent upon man.\nIf intent is clouded by things and one falls into misfortune,\nYet knows not to reflect—\nOnly piously pleading to Heaven,\nLike a guilty minister who has lost his way.\n\nWithout the staff to wield,\nHe only polishes his words and feigns respect,\nHoping the ruler will listen—\nThough he trembles and grovels, bowing deeply,\nExhausting all artifice—\nWhat good does it do?\nIt only deepens his delusion.\n\nThe Great Sage’s petition to Heaven—\nA portrait of the deceitful minister—\nHow could the ruler take such a heart,\nAnd make it sincere?\n\nThe Jade Emperor’s edict:\nLet Han Xiang go with the Great Sage to investigate.\n*The Zhou Ben Ji* names the Han clan as descendants of He.\n*Han* is *He*—\nMeaning *\"how\"*—\nAs in *\"how shall we consult this?\"*\n\nThus, upon close investigation, even the Five Emperors could not intervene, so the Monkey was ordered to select celestial generals. The Celestial Master, Xu Jingyang, merely said, *\"Let him choose the generals according to his judgment.\"* Having selected the Li Heavenly King and his sons, as well as the Thunder Lord, the Jade Emperor granted his request—neither the Heavenly Belt nor the Celestial Master could oppose it.\n\nWhen the Prince Nezha unleashed his magic, his transformations were boundless; when the Demon King hurled his ring into the sky, it ensnared the Six Divine Weapons. The Deng and Zhang lords dared not strike with thunder, and the Heavenly King exclaimed, *\"How can this be resolved?\"*—even the heavenly deities could not intervene.\n\nThey then summoned the Fire Deity of Vermilion Splendor to unleash flames, only to have the fire dragons themselves ensnared; next, they called upon the Water Deity of Wuhao Palace to flood the battlefield, but the waters surged outward uncontrollably. Even these lifeless yet tangible forces—fire and water—could not subdue him.\n\nFinally, the Monkey transformed his own hairs into tiny monkeys, only to have them trapped as well. Resuming his true form, he realized that distant measures were futile and began to consider the principle of *\"near-taking from within.\"* Yet how could he hope to restrain one so reckless when his efforts were confined to mere skin and hair?\n\nThe assembled gods deliberated:\n\nThe Demon King is easy to subdue—only the child’s nature is difficult to conquer.\nUnless the treasure is obtained, the demon cannot be captured afterward.\n\nFor the strategy to subdue the demon, nothing surpasses first seizing what the demon relies upon;\nTo seize what the demon relies upon, nothing surpasses first mastering what one oneself employs.\n\nThus, Deng and Zhang the Two Masters said: *\"If one must practice the art of stealth, none but the Great Sage can do it.\"*\nStealth means subtle transformation and silent operation.\nTo act with virtue is within oneself, not dependent on others;\nOnly by inwardly reflecting and rigorously self-examining,\nSilently transforming within the heart,\nCan one suddenly reclaim what was lost—\nNot by mere theft of peaches or elixirs,\nNor by superficially grasping it as a skill.\n\nThus, the Pilgrim stole into the demon’s cave\nAnd suddenly saw the Golden-Hooped Rod—\nThis was a fleeting enlightenment,\nYet the master of the staff returned to its rightful owner.\nBut it was not guaranteed he would not lose it again,\nFor seizing it through theft was but a glimmer in a crack,\nUnable to perceive the whole,\nAnd thus ultimately could not escape its bonds.\n\nEarth resides in the central palace,\nWhile Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire encircle it in function;\nDistributed to the four corners,\nMetal, Wood, Water, and Fire encircle it in form.\nDeparting from its proper office and achieving one-sided dominance—\nIf Earth accumulates and buries Metal,\nThen the Golden-Hooped Rod is ensnared;\nIf Earth obstructs and Water is blocked,\nThen Water’s force cannot break free from the bonds.\n\nEarth, as the proper principle, is most divine;\nEarth, as perverse, is also most divine.\nThis vile Earth steals its circle to ensnare all things.\n\nThus, when the spleen fails, danger is near;\nWhen intent is corrupt, affairs fall into chaos.\nThose skilled in distinguishing yellow (Earth) must regulate the spleen;\nThose skilled in nurturing life must first subdue the intent.\nFor intent can harm the heart and disrupt the Five Virtues,\nJust as Earth can harm nature and disrupt the Five Phases.\n\nTo tame the Earthly intent,\nNo amount of deliberation, strategy, coercion, or force can succeed—\nThis is why the heavenly deities, Thunder Lord, Fire Deity, and Water God were ineffective.\n\nThus, the precept states:\n*\"The mind-monkey, though plotting a thousand schemes,\nFinds water and fire useless in refining the demon.\"*\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Two**\n*The Great Sage Raises Havoc in the Golden-Hooped Left \"Mountain\" Right \"Pouch\" Cave*\n*The Buddha subtly instructs the protagonist:*\n*\"The Sage said to the Awakened One:*\n*The Venerable Huiyan Zen Master replied:*\n*'There is something prior to Heaven and Earth,\nFormless, originally still and empty.'\"*\n\nThe mind-monkey, though plotting a thousand schemes,\nFinds water and fire useless in refining the demon.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Two**\n*The Great Sage Raises Havoc in the Golden-Hooped Left \"Mountain\" Right \"Pouch\" Cave*\n*The Buddha subtly instructs the protagonist:*\n\n*\"The Awakened One said:\nThe Venerable Huiyan Zen Master replied:\n'There is something prior to Heaven and Earth,\nFormless, originally still and empty—\nIt can govern all phenomena,\nYet does not wither with the Four Seasons.'\n\nThis points to the luminous and unceasing clarity,\nThe true essence of Heaven’s nature, where form and breath are none.\nThe Buddha’s teaching here is precisely this.\n\nHe who knows the **principal** [主] of intent dwells in the void,\nHe who comprehends the **principal** of intent abides in seated illumination.\nOnly when the protagonist is **obtained** can the Earthly intent be steadied;\nOnly when the protagonist is **known** can the **principal** be **obtained**.\n\nIf one relies on the power of transient perceptions and worldly wisdom,\nYet seeks to pacify emotions and still intent—\nThis is like summoning the heavenly deities, Thunder Lord, Fire Deity, and Water God,\nOnly to remain trapped in their schemes.\n\nEven if one gains a fleeting glimpse of insight,\nSuddenly recalling the old self—\nIt is but like a thief raiding a camp or plundering a fortress,\nA mere skirmish of scattered troops and clever tactics.\n\n*'The Pilgrim stole the Golden-Hooped Rod.\nThen he tried to steal its binding circle,\nLike a pickpocket’s trade—\nSeeing the circle but not knowing what it was,\nHe couldn’t touch it.\nOnly the fire-arm glowed brightly,\nLike daylight itself,\nAnd when he saw all the traps and weapons vanish,\nHe rejoiced and rode the dragon back in flames.'*\n\nThis is the fleeting glimpse of insight,\nThe sudden recall of the old self—\nSo-called chasing the superficial while losing the root,\nGaining only to lose again—\nHow could they walk the path,\nWhen Eight Rules, Sha Monk, and the Elder still held him bound,\nAnd the White Horse with its baggage remained in the house?\n\nThus, the old sage scolded the Daoist path:\n*'O thief-monkey!*'\n\nThe old demon scoffed, *\"You waste your contrivances—you know nothing of my true power!\"*\nIndeed, he did not know the root.\n\nAll the gods, thinking themselves triumphant,\nRallied again for battle.\n*\"The gods remain bare-handed,\nThe Great Sage still fights empty-handed.\"*\n\nWhat use is the brilliance of fire\nTo pierce the darkness of the boundless sky?\nWith nothing to grasp or exert,\nHow could they counter the phantom stirrings of the earth?\n\nThus the old demon cried, *\"My children, move the earth and build!\"*\nPlotting to *\"slay the Tang Monk and his three disciples to repay the earth,\nSo all may scatter blessings and enjoy their rewards.\"*\nEarth’s movement harms essence and life—\nThe words made it plain.\n\n*\"Fire’s virtue resents its haste,\nThunder’s lord blames his impatience,\nThe Water Spirit falls silent in frustration.\"*\nAll were sharp-witted, yet recalled treacherous schemes,\nTheir discord and imbalance now evident.\n\nHow else could one discern this\nUnless the Tathāgata’s wisdom-eye observed?\n\nThe Tathāgata—\nNeither from nor to anywhere,\nThe very *\"Heaven’s unalterable nature\"*—\nIs the *\"Thus-Come-One\"* who neither gains nor loses.\n\nThe *\"wisdom-eye\"*—\nThe innate luminous clarity of true nature,\nReturning to self-illumination,\nTransparent within and without,\nNot a hair’s breadth obscured,\nNeither clinging nor resisting,\nNaturally pure and still—\nLike a mirror’s calm water.\n\nThe Pilgrim arrived at the Sacred Summit,\nSurveying the four directions,\nWhen suddenly a voice called out:\n*\"Sun Wukong, where have you come from?\"*\n\nNot truly arriving at the Sacred Summit—\nThe *\"Sacred Platform\"* of the heart-mind is the place itself.\nAwakening suddenly to the Tathāgata’s realm,\nHe replied: *\"I have just arrived at this noble land.\"*\n\nThe Tathāgata asked: *\"How did you come here alone?\"*\nA place unknown to others,\nYet known only to oneself.\n\nThe Tathāgata had long since perceived it through his wisdom-eye,\nAnd already knew—\n*\"Though I know of that fiend,\nI must not reveal it.\"*\n\nThis thing must be self-realized;\nWords cannot convey it—\n*\"That which cannot be spoken is called speech.\"*\n\nAgain, the Tathāgata said:\n*\"I shall lend you my magical power.\"*\n\nThe Pilgrim asked: *\"What power does the Tathāgata lend me?\"*\nThe Tathāgata then commanded the Eighteen Arhats\nTo open the treasure vault\nAnd take eighteen grains of *jīndānshā* (gold elixir sand).\nEach took one grain,\nAnd gave it to Wukong to aid his strength.\nThus trapped, the fiend could not move his body,\nNor lift his feet.\n\nMarvelous!\n*\"Eighteen\"*—the number of *\"wood,\"*\nWhich, if taken literally, suggests wood subdues earth as aid—\nYet this is mere empty reasoning.\nWhere could one exert effort?\n\nEighteen grains of *jīndānshā*,\nTaken by the Eighteen Arhats—\nEach took one grain.\n*\"Eighteen\"* plus *\"each\"* becomes *\"gé\"* (格),\nMeaning *\"to restrain\"*—\nOnly by restraining it can one seize it,\nAs in *\"opening the golden treasure vault,\nEach takes what they recognize.\"*\n\nThus, to cultivate sincerity,\nOne must first attain knowledge,\nAnd knowledge lies in investigating things.\n\nThe character *\"wù\"* (物) bears the radical *\"niú\"* (牛).\nThe *Shuōwén* says:\n*\"The ox is the great thing.\nThe cycles of Heaven and Earth begin with the Ox.\"*\nHeaven and Earth rely on the Ox to complete their revolutions;\nHumanity relies on sincerity to harmonize the center.\n\nYet why did the eighteen grains of *jīndānshā* vanish?\n*\"Jīndān\"* called *\"shā\"* (sand)—\nThe outer husk of the golden elixir.\nThe sage deliberately turned the phrase,\nLest scholars mistake *\"investigating things\"* for mere *\"collecting things,\"*\nAnd fail to grasp the essence of investigation.\nOnly when knowledge is complete\nCan one truly investigate.\n\nIf one merely examines things without true knowing,\nEven if they exhaust all books from the age of Xuanyuan onward,\nMemorizing every classification,\nOr investigate all things within the cosmos—\nEncompassing all plants and creatures—\nIt is still distant, superficial pursuit,\nChasing externals and losing the vital core,\nUnrelated to life and essence.\n\n*\"Laughing at past delusions,\nSeeking branches and leaves beyond.\"*\n\nHow could this be,\nWhen the Arhats stood empty-handed in the clouds?\nNames alone filled their minds,\nYet their hands were truly empty—\nWhere was the restraining?\n\nOnly when knowledge is complete\nCan one truly investigate.\nSelecting the good,\nThen investigating thoroughly;\nOnly when precise,\nCan knowledge be complete.\n\n「To select the good and clarify principles,\nTo refine precision and grasp the central truth,\nOnly then can one subdue this creature without difficulty.\n\nThe Buddha’s command to the two revered beings—**Subduing Dragon** and **Taming Tiger**—who lingered behind:\n*\"The two revered beings said to the Pilgrim: ‘O **Sun Wukong**, do you know why we two are slow to depart?’*\n*The Pilgrim replied: ‘I do not.’\"*\n\nOnly when one understands the essential subtleties of **Subduing Dragon** and **Taming Tiger**,\nCan one fully grasp and know them to their depths.\n\nThe **Arhats** explained:\n*\"The Buddha commanded: ‘Having lost the **Golden Elixir Cinder** (金丹砂),\nLet **Sun Wukong** ascend to **Laozi’s** **Highest Primordial Heaven** (離很天太上老君處) to seek its traces.’\"*\n\n**Laozi** embodies the **Li** (☉) hexagram’s fifth line—\nFive hollows within yet capable of containing all things,\nThus able to **calm the mind** and remain unmoving.\n\nThe **Golden Elixir Cinder** (金刚琢) is the **Li** (☉) hexagram’s **yellow ear** (黄耳),\nFirm yet yielding, golden yet with jade-like purity,\nUnchanging from beginning to end,\nThus able to **encompass all things** without leaving any trace.\n\nIn the sixth chapter, this treasure was used\nAnd struck the **Great Sage** (大聖) at that moment—\nIts meaning has been fully expounded.\n\nThis reveals why **Laozi** lost his **central void** (中),\nNot because the **Golden Elixir Cinder** was truly lost from his **hollow core** (虚中),\nBut due to the **boy’s** ignorance and confusion,\nWhich stirred the **earthly passions** (意土) into chaos.\n\nIt is clear that the **human heart** (人心) possesses an **awakened child** (灵童),\nYet when obscured by ignorance, it fails to recognize,\nThus acting blindly and recklessly,\nCreating mischief and havoc,\nEndangering one’s **life and essence** (性命).\n\nWith a **transformative vessel** (化质之器具) turned against the **sage’s head** (圣魔头),\nThis is all because of the **unrestrained movement** (纵放出入) of this very thing.\n\nThe key to **subduing and returning** lies in\nOne’s own **secret discernment** (密察),\nNot in reliance upon others.\n\n*\"The Pilgrim’s eyes did not waver,\nGazing east and west—\"*\nA **divine observation** (神观).\n\n*\"Suddenly seeing the boy dozing,\nThe ox nowhere in sight,\nHe cried: ‘Master, the ox is gone!\nThe ox is gone!’\"*\nNow tracking the **footprints of the culprit** (脚色),\nTrue knowing and clear vision.\n\n*\"The boy awoke with a start,\"*\nAs if emerging from a dream.\n\n*\"It has now been seven days,\"*\nThe time of **seven-day return** (七日来复),\nWhen **Heaven’s will** (天心) is restored.\n\nOnly upon uncovering the **stolen Golden Elixir Cinder** (偷去金刚琢),\nDoes one achieve **full mastery of things** and **complete knowing** (物格而知至).\n\n**\"Laozi brandished his banana leaf fan,\"**\nHolding the **pure and empty qi** (清虚之气),\nTo restore the **central void** (虚中之物),\nThus embodying the principle of **\"grasping the center while preserving sincerity\"** (执中存诚).\n\n**\"He shouted: ‘Ox! Why do you not return home?’\"**\n\nThat demon instantly recognized the protagonist—\nwith one wave of the fan, the illusionary circle was cast aside;\nwith a second, the original form was revealed.\nAs the saying goes:\n*\"A single call awakens the enlightened child,\nTwo breaths restore the true form to the Supreme Clarity.\"*\n\n*\"Laozi mounted the ox and ascended to Heaven,\nThe assembled deities took up their arms and departed,\nMaster and disciple prepared their gear to leave the cave.\"*\n\nThe meaning is settled, the heart at peace—\nall thanks to the Buddha’s wisdom eye revealing the truth.\nThose who seek the Dao each possess the Buddha’s wisdom eye—\nyet why do they alone fail to recognize the protagonist within?\n\nThe passage where Laozi says,\n*\"Seven returns of the Fire Elixir—\none grain consumed, seven days of slumber ensue,\"*\nholds a deeper truth.\n*\"Seven returns\"* is the refined divine fire—\nafter ingestion, the bones grow numb, the sinews languid,\na natural seven-day repose,\nwhich is in truth a great awakening, not a great sleep.\n\nThe immortal teacher deliberately lingered at the drowsy ox-tending spot,\nrevealing the secret in idle conversation.\n\nThe marvels of the Returned Elixir have already been fully disclosed in prior sections—\nnow let the discerning examine them closely.\n\n---\n**Fifty-third Chapter**\n*The Spirit Lord Swallows the Meal and Conceives a Ghost-Born Babe*\n*The Yellow Nurse Draws Water to Dissolve the Demon Womb*\n\nA sage once said:\n*\"The disciple honors the master—\nthough taking what was not his own,\nhe retains a kernel of reverent filial devotion.\"*\n\nThe earthly deity’s words\nseem to condemn him as directly defiled.\n\nThe thief takes his spoils and barely endures,\nthe monkey wears silk while sporting a ragged crown—\nplainly, they are but kindling for a gate,\na dog barking at the golden **box** (*left \"mountain,\" right \"trap\"*),\ntheir bones exposed beneath borrowed robes.\n\nAll act at whim, defying proper bounds,\nutterly lacking the stillness of sitting.\n\nThough luck may spare them, how can they avoid shameful death?\n\nThe Tripitaka Master said:\n*\"Had I known I’d not escape this circle,\nI’d never have risked this peril to my life.\"*\n\nThe Pilgrim said:\n*\"All because you didn’t trust my circle,\nyet forced me to endure another’s.\"*\n\nFor man’s circle or my circle—\nboth are one circle.\n\nTwo **\"men\"** in harmony form **\"sitting\"** (*土*), but when discord arises and they part from the earth,\nthen man is man, earth is earth—\nno sitting-nature remains, and they step beyond the circle.\n\nThe dispute lies in a single thought:\nthe moment of separation or union,\nwhere truth and falsehood are divided.\n\nTo step out or enter—\nonly self-awareness matters.\n\nThe Tathagata points to the root:\nthe path of insight into the sitting-nature’s separation and union,\nthe true **dharma** for abiding and establishing life.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Wash away thoughts and cleanse the heart to return to true awakening,\neat wind and drink dew as you journey westward.\"*\n\nThe above speaks of cultivating the nature’s root—\nexhaustive and complete.\n\nYet the sages say that exhausting nature reaches life,\nnever speaking only of nature itself.\n\nFor when nature is exhausted, life attains its fullness—\nlife lies within the exhaustion of nature.\n\nThis is the sage’s unchanging, immutable **Dao**,\nencompassing all under heaven and future generations,\nso that the wise, the foolish, the virtuous, and the unworthy\nmay all bow and accept, or rise and reach it.\n\nThus, the sage rarely speaks of life,\nfor its principle is too subtle,\nlest it arouse in people the fear of hidden, difficult-to-understand depths.\n\nOnly in the *Zhouyi*’s **Dao** of yin and yang’s harmonious exchange,\nthe subtleties of *Kan* and *Li*’s completion,\nthe mechanism of all things’ transformation and birth,\ndoes he speak at length without tiring—\nnever cutting off people from their own ultimate attainment.\n\nIn the following three chapters,\nthe cultivation of life is clarified to perfect the holy embryo,\nusing the **pre-heaven** true **yi** (*乙*) within the **bing** water (*壬*) to achieve authenticity—\nnot by clinging to a single aspect to cultivate,\nand thus forming the false image of solitary yin or solitary yang.\n\nI have read *Waiji Zazhi*:\n*\"In the northeastern sea corner lies a land of women,\nwith no men.\nGazing into a well causes conception,\nand they bear daughters.\"*\n\nThe text refers to it as the **\"Western Liang\"** Women’s Realm (*西梁女国*),*\npointing to that very place,\nwhere it will metaphorically embody the image of a man’s body being pure and untainted by yang.\n\nZhongli Gong said:\n*\"Tears, saliva, seminal essence, qi, blood, and bodily fluids—\nseven kinds of refined substances, all yin.\nIf one uses these to forge the elixir,\nhow can one ascend to the Jade Capital as a spirit?\"*\n\nFor after a man’s body is broken,\nhis **pre-heaven** true yang is already lost—\nnot only is semen obstructed,\nbut his qi is also yin.\n\nIf one clings to cultivating life within a single body\nand seeks to restore true yang,\nthen it is as the *Cansong Qi* says:\n*\"A hen broods an egg—\nits chick will never be whole.\nA woman marries a woman,\nrefining yin with yin.\nWhy then does she weave and spin?\nWhy then does she give birth and transform?\"*\n\nCultivators of the elixir, reading the works of immortals and true sages,\nencounter phrases like *\"a man’s pregnancy is no different from a woman’s,\"*\nand thus mistakenly think to form an elixir embryo within themselves\nby using their own seminal essence and blood,\nas if performing the marvel of husband and wife within one’s own body.\n\nWithout a true master’s guidance,\nmisunderstanding the profound intent,\nthey become like the Tripitaka Master and the foolish monk,\ndrinking from the **Child-Mother River**,\nconceiving a ghost-born babe,\nand falling ill as a result.\n\nThe **Yellow Nurse** laughed heartily:\n*\"You’re drinking water from that river over there?\nWhat a prank!\"*\n\n「Good joke! Such utter confusion truly deserves to be laughed out of court. The Nurse speaks of the **Child-Mother River**—\n\n*\"The Welcoming Yang Inn* and *Illuminating Embryo Spring*!\"\nShe says the **Child-Mother River** flows with pure yin, merging with the Yang, yet never lingering as a station,\nand that the *Illuminating Embryo Spring* yields only female offspring, never male—pure yin, no yang at all.\n\nIf one cultivates yin to form an embryo,\nwith a tangible body and distinct shape,\nit is clearly a *\"clot of blood, lump of flesh.\"*\n*\"How can a man’s body, lacking a birth passage,\never extricate it?\"*\nUnless it is through the *\"flawed side, where the child’s intestine is nurtured,\nand the neck is mistaken for the embryonic womb—*\nthe *\"Gentle Hands, Steady Nurse\"*—\nnot knowing where to apply force,\nfearing only to *\"squeeze and rupture the sac,\"*\nand then needing medicine to abort the embryo.\n\nSuch cold, mocking actions,\neverywhere sharp with hidden meaning,\nare nothing but a farce—\na grotesque performance of reckless folly,\nseeking death in life’s guise—\nto ridicule the world’s blind stupidity.\nDo not dismiss it as mere jest or idle play!\n\nThe Nurse points out:\n*\"To the true south lies the **Yang-Solving Mountain** and **Child-Splitting Cavern**,\nwhere the Embryo Spring descends.\"*\n\nNow, the **Child-Mother River**’s yin waters\nthat the Tripitaka Master and the foolish monk consumed\nhad not yet reached the *Welcoming Yang Inn*,\nuntainted by yang qi—\nso they could say it *\"dissolves yin,\"*\nbut why call it *\"Yang-Solving\"*?\n\nIt is because this water,\nwhich humans fail to grasp as true yang,\nearns the name *\"Yang-Solving\"*—\na mountain that can dissolve the true essence of this yang water,\nonly then capable of shattering the false formations of yin waters.\nIt is not to be mistaken for *\"breaking a yin embryo\"* as *Yang-Solving*.\n\nThe true south is the position of the **Li** hexagram,\nwhich clarifies the *Yang-Solving* principle.\nThe Spring is a well—\na well is the **Kan** hexagram.\nWithin *Kan* lies the **preheaven true yang**,\nthe **true yi water** of the **wang** cycle,\nthe place where *Kan* and *Li* interact in harmony,\nwhere spinning and weaving reach their peak—\nthe waters surge, and true essence is born.\n\nFrom the beginning of creation,\nall things with form and substance\narise from and transform through this **true yi water** of the three elements and eight trigrams.\n\n「Thus, the **Sage’s Fire** absorbs this **true yi water** into its belly,\nilluminating my **true yin mercury**—\nthen all the **yin evils** within my body are utterly annihilated,\njust as the *Treasure of Enlightenment* says:\n\n*\"In the pool’s red dawn, yin demons vanish.\"*\n\nThe meaning of **true yin** and **true yang** is made clear in one verse—\nthe enlightened shall understand it themselves.\n\nThis is called the **\"As-You-Wish True Immortal\"**—\n*\"renovating it into the Gathering of Immortals Hall,*\n*guarding the Falling Path Well.\"*\nIf one attains this **true yi water** and cultivates the body,\nnothing shall be unfulfilled.\n\nIt is where the **True Immortal’s Water** resides—\nthe place where **Immortal Qi** converges.\nOne cannot obtain it lightly—\nhow could it not be guarded?\n\nYet if one seeks **true yi water**,\none must spend wealth to acquire it.\n\nIf there is no wealth,\none can only endure fate.\n\nThe **Old Mother’s** words are each a guiding clue—\nshe truly has a **compassionate heart for saving the world**!\n\nThe **Practitioner**, upon hearing this,\nrides the clouds to the mountain,\nand sees the **Old Daoist** fully explain its significance.\n\nBut why does the **True Immortal** grow angry?\nBecause **true yi water**, when taken in accordance with the **Dao/Way**,\nbecomes the **human essence**—\nwhen taken against it,\nbecomes the **essence of the Immortal**—\ntaking it in accord is easy,\ntaking it against is difficult.\nEasy brings fulfillment,\ndifficult brings no fulfillment.\n\nThe **anger and conflict** here\nsymbolize the difficulty of taking it against the **Dao/Way**,\nfulfilling one’s wish yet not attaining it.\n\nUnable to fulfill one’s wish,\none cannot bear to abandon the **precious virtue** of the **Sage’s Fire**.\n\nThis is why the **Sage’s Fire** and **Precious Virtue** are suddenly raised—\nto contrast and debate their merits.\n\nWithout the **Yellow Mother’s** mediation,\nseeking aid in vain,\nthe matter would never be resolved.\n\nThe **Sand Monk**, of the **earth element**,\nis the **Yellow Mother**.\n\n*\"The Practitioner directly returns to the village dwelling,*\n*summons the Sand Monk to seize the opportunity and take the water.\nThe Monk retrieves his **precious technique**,\nstrikes down the Daoist, and takes the water away.\"*\n\nThis makes clear:\nwithout the **Yellow Mother’s** **precious staff**,\none cannot obtain the water.\n\n*\"The Practitioner snatches the True Immortal’s As-You-Wish Hook\"*\n—**true yi** is now in hand.\n\n*\"He breaks it into two segments,*\n*then splits one of those into four.\"*\n\nThe **Hook** is **yi**—\nfor **true yi** transforms into the **Two Principles (yin-yang)**,\nand the **Two Principles** into the **Four Phases (four symbols)**.\n\nThe **True Immortal** is also called **Master**—\nwhat he holds is the **Hook**,\nwhat he guards is the **Water**,\nconcealing the meaning of **preheaven true yi water** of the **wang cycle**.\n\n*\"Laughing heartily, he rides the clouds and returns\"*\n—seeing that what was not wished for\nwas taken against the **Dao/Way**,\nyet now attains fulfillment.\n\nThe verse’s meaning is profound.\n\nIf one refines **true yin lead** as **yang**,\none must use this **yang water** of **true yi**.\nThis **yang water** is the **true yin lead** itself,\nhence the saying: *\"True yin lead, when refined, requires true yang water.\"*\n\nObtaining this **yang water** of **true yi**\nand blending it with my **true yin mercury**,\nthen my **mercury** shall dry naturally—\nhence the saying: *\"True yang water blends with true yin mercury, making it dry.\"*\n\nYet if **true yin mercury** and **true yin lead** do not harmonize,\ntheir **Qi** cannot be attained—\nthey have **form and substance** yet lack **mother Qi**,\nand cannot form the **Elixir**—\nhence the saying: *\"True yin mercury and true yin lead lack mother Qi.\"*\n\nOne must add **Soul Sand** and **Flying Ascension’s** **precious medicines**—\nthose with **Qi yet no substance**,\nare true **Immortal Elixirs**—\nhence the saying: *\"Soul Sand and precious medicines are Immortal Elixirs.\"*\n\nIf one only cultivates within the body,\nit is no more than **swallowing saliva** and **absorbing Qi**,\n**consuming evil** and **feasting on fluids**—\neven if a **fetal form** is created,\nit is a **pure yin** malady—\nhence the saying: *\"The child’s fetal form is falsely structured.\"*\n\nOnly when the **Yellow Mother** blends **golden water**\nand applies the **refining technique**,\ndoes it become the **true wondrous Dao**—\nhence the saying: *\"The earthly mother applies the technique—this is no ordinary matter.\"*\n\nUnderstanding this,\none shall *\"overturn false sects, uphold the orthodox teaching,*\n*the mind of the Sage rejoices, returning to delight.\"*\n\nThis water *\"requires but a single sip,*\n*to dissolve the fetal Qi.\"*\n\nThat is—\nwhen **true yi Qi** enters the **crucible** and illuminates the **mercury**,\nit dissolves the **false embryo**,\nforming the **natural Immortal fetus**—\na marvel of **one action yielding two results**.\n\nThose who **swallow yin** and **consume substances**,\nare they not **self-inflicted sins through the mouth**?\n\nThus it concludes:\n*\"Washing away oral sins, the body becomes pure,*\n*melting away mortal fetuses, the body transforms naturally.\"*\n\nIn the **fifty-fourth chapter**,\nthe **Old Mother** speaks of *\"slicing flesh to make a fragrant pouch\"*—\nthis warns that when taking the water,\ngreat peril lies ahead,\nas if entering a **tiger’s den** to seize its cub,\nrequiring utmost caution.\nYet she has already foreshadowed the **terrifying nature** of the **Female Realm**.\n\nThe **fifty-fourth chapter** states:\n*\"The Western Liang Female Realm—*\n*the mind-monkey devises a plan to escape the illusory world.\"*\n\nA blind teacher misleads others,\nsevering the **ultimate Dao**—\nsuch contrivances\nnot only harm life\nbut also disrupt **dharma-nature**.\n\nThe **Immortal Master** uses the **Western Liang Female Realm** as an allegory.\n\nThe verse says:\n*\"Within the realm, pure yin lacks the least yang\"*—\nthis cuts through the confusion clearly.\n\nFor **male and female** copulation,\nall things transform and are born.\n\nThe **female** attains it as **human seed**,\nthe **male** attains it as **Immortal seed**.\nTheir copulation is fundamentally distinct—\n**yang** and **yin** differ in direction.\n\nThe **Female Realm’s** elderly and young women\nall clap joyfully in unison:\n*\"The human seed has arrived!*\n*The human seed has arrived!\"*\n\nThey rejoice at seeing the **male**—\nyet this is merely to fulfill their desires,\nand to fulfill them is to bring forth **human transformation** alone.\n\nAs for the **Welcome to Yang Station** and the **Fetal Spring**,\nalong the way,\nall seen—\nfrom noble to common, in attire—\nare but depictions of **pure yin without yang**.\n\nThis makes clear:\nthe **Practitioner’s path** has not yet succeeded—\nhow could he become an **Immortal** or **Buddha**?\n\nThe **station magistrate** reports,\nand the **Female Sovereign** is overjoyed,\nsaying:\n*\"Last night I dreamed of this—*\n*today’s joy is a sign of good fortune!\"*\nShe declares:\n*\"Since the time of **Chaos** and the **Opening of Creation**,\nacross generations of emperors,\nno man has ever come to my realm.\"*\n\nI vow to pair with him in yin-yang harmony,\nto bear sons and grandsons,\nand perpetuate the imperial lineage forever.\n\nFor since time immemorial to this day,\nthere has never been one who paired with a man in yin-yang harmony,\nbearing sons and grandsons.\n\nNow, to see a man and fulfill his desires—\nthis is a rare event since the Opening of Creation.\n\nYet just as there has never been, from time immemorial to this day,\none who paired with a woman in yin-yang harmony,\nfulfilling her desires,\nand thereby attained Immortality or Buddhahood—\n\nSo too, to see a woman and desire to pair with her,\nfulfilling her desires,\nis an event as rare as last night’s dream.\n\nThus, though one cannot attain Immortality or Buddhahood\nwithout the Dao of human transformation,\nit is not through carnal union to fulfill desire,\nbut through spiritual union to reverse its mechanism.\n\nThis is why the woman rejoices at seeing a man,\nwhile the man laments seeing a woman—\nlamenting that she can dissipate his true *qi*,\nand that his life and essence will follow.\n\nThe key lies in refining nature and forgetting desire,\ntranscending the realm while counteracting its forces.\n\n*\"The Grand Preceptor and Station Magistrate arrive at the hall to discuss betrothal and celebrate.\nThey stand in attendance, addressing her as 'Subject.'\nThey speak of auspicious dreams,\nand boast of the kingdom’s wealth.\"*\n\nThe edict was issued to clear the way and welcome the bride,\nspreading out feasts and arranging women in rows,\ndisplaying the palanquin—\na scene depicting the perilous ease of seduction.\n\n*\"The Queen steps forward, seizing the Tripitaka Master,\ncooing, 'Brother,'*\ntaking his unadorned hand,\nsitting together in the dragon carriage;\nleaning against his fragrant shoulder,\nnestling against his peach-blossom cheek;\nchoosing an auspicious day for the feast,\nsealing their union in marriage and enthronement,\"*\nportraying the most soul-shattering, will-sapping affair.\n\n*\"Then came the enchanting music of pipes and drums,\nthe allure of rouge and powder;\nher slender fingers, poised to lift the cup,\narranging the banquet seats;\na single exchange chair, the dragon bed where he was seated—\nshe giggled, dripping with charm: 'Little Brother, you’re also surnamed Chen.'\nThen she said, 'Let me bestow a Buddhist name upon you—how about it?'\nTo add a man’s name to hers, clearly a sign of affection;\nto call him 'Chen' while referring to the Tang, subtly hinting at his eastern journey.\nThe terms 'Brother, you and I,'—\nthe manner of asking his surname and given name—\nfully captured her boundless tenderness.*\n\nOf all human emotions, none is more easily stirred\nthan desire for beauty,\nand what if that beauty is the queen of a nation’s charms?\nWhat if she alone is the object of that nation’s affection?\nWhat if she is not only the queen of beauty, wealth, and nobility,\nbut also adorned with every courtesy,\npossessing a thousand allures and a hundred graces,\nintelligence and tenderness—\nside by side, cheek to cheek—\nan encounter as rare and fleeting as the dawn of creation,\nyet now placed in an irresistible position,\nat a moment when resistance is utterly impossible?\n\nHow perilous! How perilous!\"\n\nThe commentator says that among the eighty-one trials of the Three Treasures, this is the greatest of all—how true his words are! Fortunately, the Pilgrim had a scheme of *\"pretending marriage to escape the net\"* to revive the dead and restore life.\n\nThe Pilgrim said, *\"Master, you just grant her request—I, Old Monkey, will handle it.\"* The logic of the world is such that the firm can be subdued by the yielding, but the yielding cannot subdue the firm. The Land of Women is the Way of yielding. When the Queen invites a husband and then abdicates, she yields even more—when yielding reaches its utmost, it becomes the utmost firmness. How then shall I deploy my own firm *qi*?\n\nThe Pilgrim said, *\"Master, rest assured. In this place, encountering this person, we must turn their own strategy against them.\"* For she uses her utmost yielding to control me, so I shall use her utmost yielding to counter her. All her yielding is for my use—this is yielding at its peak.\n\nWhy? Because the Dao of seeking the Sutras must pass through the Land of Women—there is no way to avoid it. The Land of Women has only people, and people must not be harmed. The goal is to obtain the *tongguan xinxingbao* (pass and credentials) and thus achieve both objectives.\n\nThe Master said, *\"Disciple, if we indulge in wealth and nobility here, who will go to the Western Heaven to seek the Sutras? Would we not ruin the great Tang Empire?\"*\n\nThe Pilgrim said, *\"If you refuse her by law, she will not exchange the pass documents and will not let us proceed. If she takes a dislike, her cruelty may be extreme—she might order many to cut your flesh to make incense pouches.\"* This metaphorically speaks of our great nation’s true *yang* being wounded. He added, *\"Would we ever willingly harm her?\"*\n\n**\"Must we fight her?\"**\n\n*\"This land’s people are not monsters—still, they are people. How could you bear to slaughter countless innocents?\"*\nThis metaphorically speaks of how that small realm’s true *yin* is wounded.\n\n*The Awakening to Reality* states:\n*\"Great or small, harm none—preserve both nations whole.\"*\nFor if she is unharmed, and we are aided, then the Dao’s marvel is complete.\n\nThe Pilgrim preemptively cast the *Ding Shen* spell and devised the *\"False Kinship to Escape the Net\"* stratagem—tricking her into stamping the pass documents and handing them over, so they could proceed westward. *\"First, we spare her life; second, we preserve your vital essence.\"* Is this not mutual non-harm, achieving both goals?\n\nThis false kinship, this *Ding Shen* escape—all for securing the *Tongguan Baoyin*. Without the Land of Women’s pass seal, there is no path to the Sutras. Thus, the queen must personally add the name and affix her signature.\n\nThe Western Land of Women is the critical waypoint for seeking the Sutras, hence the *Yingyang Station* and *Zhaotai Spring*—its pass documents differ from other realms.\n\n*\"The Master leaned on the fragrant shoulder, together ascending the phoenix palanquin to the Western Gate.\"*\nThe three disciples *\"united in heart, harmonized in purpose, their attire in order.\"*\n\nThe Master bowed to the queen: *\"Your Majesty, return—let your humble monk depart to fetch the Sutras.\"*\nZhu Bajie barked at her: *\"What business do we monks have with you, this painted skeleton, as husband and wife?\"*\nWith one shout, know this: beauty is but a skeleton, and false kinship is but the Dao.\n\nOnce the pass is secured, liberation follows—three hearts must guard against peril.\n*The Knocking on the Diviner’s Song* says:\n*\"Snatch away the smoke and flowers, severing lustful desire,\nRecite the *chan* hymns, singing the rouge-laced verses.\"*\n*The Danjing* says:\n*\"The non-color is true color; the non-uniting is divine union.\"*\nThis law of nature comes from the West—its intent is to escape the painted flowers.\n\nThe queen’s pass document uniquely specifies *\"Chen\"*—clearly marking the journey from east to west.\nEast is *Zhen* (☳, male), west is *Dui* (☱, female). Ah!\n*Zhen* and *Dui* in union—seemingly worldly yet transcending it;\nYin and yang paired—false marriage yet true marriage.\nFollowing yet not following; opposing yet achieving harmony;\nUsing yet not using; purity yet perfect application.\nNeither leaving nor clinging to female beauty—true copulation is not carnal.\n*\"A woman suddenly appears beside the road,\"*\nand seizes Tang Sanzang—beware the allure of smoke and flowers!\n\n---\n**Fifty-Fifth Chapter**\n*The Lustful Demon’s Trickery*\n*Upholding True Nature Preserves the Body*\n\nA Disciple of Awakening says:\nThis passage reveals how female beauty harms—its venom rivals that of scorpions, hence *\"Poison Rivaling the Mountain.\"*\nThe *\"Lute Cave\"* symbolizes the scorpion’s form.\nWhen scorpions become spirits, their *yin* venom is unmatched;\nWhen women indulge in licentiousness, their harm is even greater.\nThe Pilgrim struck its head, Zhu Bajie its mouth—\nThe Tathagata could barely endure the pain,\nThe Bodhisattva dared not approach.\nAll depict the venom’s overwhelming might—\nNot a scorpion-like woman, but a woman shaped like a scorpion.\n\nThe earlier queen—maiden, human—was the necessary path for seeking the Sutras.\nWithout her realm’s sovereign seal, one cannot proceed westward.\nTo fake marriage and escape through *Ding Shen* was not only to preserve life but to refine nature.\n\nThis later woman—lustful, a detour on the path—\nIf one falls into her snare, the poisoned hook will strike,\nAnd unless one steadfastly upholds true nature while resisting temptation,\nOne harms not only nature but life itself.\n\nThus, when encountering the queen’s beauty,\nUse life-preserving methods to refine nature—nature thrives through life’s integrity;\nWhen facing the lustful woman,\nUse true nature’s purity to safeguard life—life is secured through nature’s virtue.\n\nThis is the essence of *\"Lustful Demon’s Trickery\"* and *\"Upholding True Nature.\"*\n\nThe Western Liang women all claimed:\n*\"We are *White Day Ascension* Arhats,\"*\n*\"Mistaken for Chinese men.\"*\nThis points to the Land of Women as the true realm of *Dan* cultivation—where one ascends in daylight—\nNot to be confused with Chinese men as mere mortals,\nFor they possess such transcendence.\n\nRegret and awakening return to the court—harm none, benefit all.\n\nIn Tang Sanzang’s first great ordeal,\nHe fulfilled his greatest purpose:\nSecuring the queen’s pass seal and adding his name—\nA marvelous stroke.\n\nThe Immortal Master, fearing worldly misinterpretation—\nThat one might think he gained through defilement—\nCast himself into the body, even to the point of ruin,\nYet none could save him.\nThus, he offers this parable as a warning.\n\nThe green stone screen door is unbreakable;\nThe bee clings to flowers, reluctant to part.\n*\"Human flesh filling\"*—concealing treachery;\n*\"Clear sand filling\"*—disguised as beauty’s allure.\n*\"Wealth, honor, glory\"*—still worth sharing;\n*\"Leisure and ease\"*—only she craves delight.\n*\"Just right for chanting scriptures, reciting the Buddha’s words as companions,\"*\nYet clear as the Buddha’s mouth, hidden as a scorpion’s heart—\nLike a sheep with a tiger.\n*\"Do not say ‘a hundred years of harmony is true,’*\nFor know this: the monkey’s head, the Buddha’s hand,\nThe inverted hook, the pig’s snare.\"\n\nThe queen, though human, moves with propriety—\nOne may counter her schemes with guile.\nThis demon, however, harms life through lust—\nOnly brute force and spiritual resolve suffice.\n\nSplitting the white bread roll nearly revealed a hidden treasure;\nThe whole roasted meat package concealed a lustful trap—\nYet the Dao-heart remained unshaken, though the human heart was exposed.\n\nTwo who converse risk stirring desire—\nThe two disciples rush to rescue, fearing peril.\n\nCourageously they stand their ground,\nOnly then revealing the woman’s weapons’ sharp edge—\nNo matter if you’ve refined her in the Eight Trigrams Furnace,\nOr forged her from Heaven-Roaring Golden Cangue Metal,\nShe’s a wanton, cheap thing—\nCalling her husband to lure him in, yet wasting the iron-mouthed blade\nHoned at High Old Village to pierce the earth.\n\nAh, the Master Tripitaka!\nA true monk with true precepts—\nCloud-like emotions, rain-like intentions,\nUnseen, unheard, untouched by thought—\nForged into my ten thousand pounds of refined gold.\n\nAh, the demon woman!\nHer yin-scheming, yin-poisoned hands—\nCoaxing, binding, calling out, *\"Good husband, good wife!\"*\nAlmost draining a man’s very marrow.\n\nAh, the Bodhisattva’s mercy!\nRevealing her feet, knowing her tail,\nPointing to her true form’s subjugation—\nUnless one attains supreme enlightenment.\n\nAh, the star Maotai!\nManifesting her form, raising her head,\nHer high cries dying on the slope—\nTruly, the *\"day-see\"* snow melts away.\n\nWhen the Yang Official arrives, the lustful demon is suppressed;\nWhen the sun reddened in the pond, the yin-monster vanishes—\nWhoever steadfastly cultivates true nature\nWill not let worldly desires disturb them.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Severing dusty ties, abandoning form’s illusion,\nPushing through the golden sea to awaken the Zen heart.\"*\n\nOnce, reading the Buddhist scriptures,\nMañjuśrī’s disciple Kumārajīva—\nA divine monk—\nComposed *The Treatise on Reality* in two volumes,\nRecited at the Grass Hall Temple.\nEmperor Yao Xing and a thousand high-ranking monks and officials\nSat in solemn silence, listening.\n\nKumārajīva suddenly left his seat and said to Xing:\n*\"Two boys have climbed my desire-barrier—\nThey need a woman.\"* Xing then summoned palace maids,\nAnd after one union, two sons were born.\nHow could this true monk have broken the precept?\nXing further forced ten courtesans upon him,\nSetting up a separate dwelling for him to receive them—\nWhat difference is this from embracing a *pipa*?\n\nAt that time, many monks followed Kumārajīva’s example.\nHe then gathered needles to fill a bowl\nAnd said to the assembly:\n*\"If any can match this feat, only then may you keep a wife.\"*\nHe lifted a spoonful of needles and swallowed them,\nNo different from eating.\n\nThe monks, ashamed, bowed in submission.\n\nKumārajīva had already cultivated an indestructible golden body—\nThus he could swallow needles and still conceive children,\nDispelling desire’s barrier, not breaking the precept.\nReceiving courtesans was but playful *samādhi*—\nNot like embracing a *pipa*.\n\nAt his passing, the funeral pyre burned his body to ashes,\nYet his tongue did not rot—\nProving his immortality.\n\nBefore attaining the elixir, how could one break precepts\nAnd embrace a *pipa*?\n\n---\n\nThe Fifth-Sixth Chapter:\n*The Mad God Slays the Grass Bandits*\n*The Dao-Confused Monkey Frees His Mind*\n\nThe son understood:\n*\"The Buddha said: ‘All minds are false minds—\nThis is called mind.\nWhy?\nThe past mind cannot be obtained;\nThe present mind cannot be obtained;\nThe future mind cannot be obtained.’\nFor the mind’s essence is empty—\nResponding to all things yet not enslaved by them;\nNeither within nor without—\nBoundless and impartial.\nNeither welcoming nor following—\nActing where there is no action.\nLike a mirror, like a valley—\nThings come and are reflected naturally.\n\nThus, though myriad changes arise,\nThis mind remains pure,\nNever disturbed by them;\nStill, never driven by them—\nThis is the true mind.\n\nIf, before things arrive, one has a mind to welcome them;\nIf, when things arrive, one is attached to them;\nIf, after things depart, one chases after them—\nThis is the Buddha’s teaching:\n‘All minds are false minds.’\n\nFalse minds harm the mind—\nDust accumulates, darkening the mirror;\nFilth clogs, blocking the valley.\n\nThus, having a mind is letting the mind go;\nHaving no mind is truly gathering the mind.\n\nYet cultivating the mind in non-existence\nStill risks falling back into aimlessness—\nAimlessness leads to obscured nature and trembling life,\nDriving one toward death—\nThe mind’s root of mortality.\n\nOnly when the mind dies does nature pierce through;\nWhen nature pierces through, life is fixed—\nAnd returns to its origin.\n\nThe secret of eternal life lies in killing the mind;\nThe secret of no-mind lies in killing the mind;\nThe secret of killing the mind lies in forgetting the self;\nThe secret of forgetting the self lies in nurturing *qi*;\nThe secret of nurturing *qi* lies in tranquility without madness.\n\nThese three principles first warn of the harm in intentional mind,\nThen of the harm in intentional no-mind,\nAnd finally of the harm in both intentional mind and no-mind.\n\nOnly when struck before the Buddha as a six-eared macaque\nDoes one grasp the wondrous truth of killing the mind.\n\nAlas! Few understand, few bear the weight—\nThus the Immortal Master must deploy his eloquence,\nUnfurl the celestial maiden’s subtle tongue,\nAnd expound these three teachings to reveal the truth.\n\nWhether one recognizes or not is beyond calculation.\n\nAt the start of the chapter, a single word encompasses all:\n*\"The Spirit Platform holds nothing—this is called clarity,\"*\nSpeaking of the mind’s original emptiness;\n*\"Silent, with not a single thought arising,\"*\nFor the mind’s essence holds nothing—\nThus, the mind values no-mind;\n*\"Monkey and horse firmly restrained, no wildness—\nSpirit steadfast, no arrogance,\"*\nSaying that having a mind is letting it go;\n*\"Banish the six demons, awaken the three vehicles,\"*\nKilling the mind to gather it;\n*\"All threads severed, clearly understood,\"*\nThe mind dies, nature returns;\n*\"The color-demon forever destroyed, transcending the true realm,\nSitting in enjoyment of the Western Paradise’s bliss,\"*\nNature restored, life preserved.\n\nWhen Tripitaka faced the female demon’s trial,\n*\"Gnawing nails, chewing iron, with life’s last breath preserving his true form,\"*\nLike one in stormy seas asking for the rudder,\nOr crossing steep mountains holding the reins tightly—\nThe mind was killed, not let go.\n\nYet ships capsize when the waters are calm;\n\nThe horse’s stumble,\nalways occurs when the path is level—why?\nBecause the mind is let go yet cannot be killed.\n\n*\"Master and disciples stood on the flat plain,\nEight Rules wielded his cudgel to urge the horse forward,\nspurring everyone to move along.\nThe Pilgrim brandished the Golden Hoop Staff—\na shout, and the horse slipped its reins,\ngalloping like a bolt of lightning.\nThe Master could not hold the bridle,\nso he let it go, releasing the full length of the reins.\"*\n\nAll depict the mind’s wild impetuosity,\nseeing intent and letting the mind go.\n\nOnce the mind goes,\nthe owner loses control,\nwhile the bandits growl like wolves.\nThus, *\"Just as he was riding steadily,\nhe suddenly heard the sound of a cudgel—\nunable to sit firm,\nhe tumbled from his horse.\"*\n\nThis is the harm of letting the mind go\nwhile acting with intent—\nas Zhang Zhuo’s *Seeing the Dao Verse* states:\n*\"Cutting off delusion only breeds more affliction,\nStriving toward Suchness is also perverse.\"*\n\nThe bandits cried:\n*\"Here we raise a ferocious resolve,\nblocking the main road,\nseeking only wealth and treasure!\"*\n\nTo block the main road and demand wealth—\nraising a ferocious resolve—\nare all acts of the mind committing theft,\nharming others for self-gain.\n\nThough the tiger seems a hero,\nits ferocious resolve is the heart of a beast—\nwhat matter this world or that?\nThe Master, saying *\"In that world, he becomes a beast,\"*\nwas also using the mind to urge goodness,\nhoping to turn this world’s heart back—\nyet he could not escape the snare of the mind.\n\nThe bandits, hearing this,\nfell into such great rage\nthat they beat, bound, and tormented him in every way,\nhoping to seize their prize,\nunaware that the disaster of their own destruction\nhad already arrived at their heels.\n\n*\"The three disciples saw their Master dangling from a tree,\nthe Pilgrim bearing a blue cloth bundle on his shoulder,\napproaching to call out to their Master,\nasking what foul deed had befallen him.\nThe Master said: ‘These highwaymen demand a toll.\nSince I have nothing to offer,\nthey’ve hung me here,\nwaiting only for you to settle the matter.’\nThe Pilgrim said: ‘Why did you speak thus to them?’\nThe Master said: ‘They beat me so fiercely,\nI had no choice but to name you—\nit was a desperate plea for help.’\nThe Pilgrim said: ‘I accept your offering,\nand that is precisely how I am offered.’\"*\n\nMarvelous!\nThe Celestial Sage writes of the artful words of surrender,\nthe false pretenses of abuse,\nyet suddenly inserts the word *\"offer\"*—\n*\"Helpless, I put you forward,\"*\n*\"I accept your honor, that is exactly how I am offered.\"*\nIt plainly points to the greed and deceit\nof those who beat and bind—\nthe greatest thieves among the elite—\nwhile truly portraying the peril in one’s very life-force.\n\nThe Pilgrim feigned giving much gold,\nbundling the cloth as tribute,\nand quoted the ancient text:\n*\"Virtue is the root;\nwealth is the branch.\"*\nsaying: *\"This is but trifling matters.\"*\nIndeed, he feared the words might be too obscure,\ntoo profound for those who merely chant *\"the, he, that, ah\"*\nor for bandits blocking the road to rob—\nlest even common scholars fail to grasp such meaning.\nThe bandits said: *\"Leave your traveling funds behind,\nor we’ll resort to violence!\"*\nThe Pilgrim said: *\"Agreed—\nthe funds must be divided three ways.\"*\nThen: *\"Let’s secretly keep some for ourselves.\"*\nAnd again: *\"If there’s more,\nwe’ll share some with you.\"*\n\nThe words ring true as bandits’ threats and pleas—\ntheir twisted tongues of *\"Leave your funds behind,\nor we’ll strike you down!\"*\nand *\"We’ll secretly keep some for ourselves,\nif there’s more, we’ll share it with you!\"*—\nreveal their malicious intent.\n\nYet in the *\"University\"*’s teaching,\n*\"To grasp the outer limits of punishment\nwhile neglecting the root of fear\"*—\nthe Pilgrim’s righteous wrath was justified,\nfor he struck down the two robbers without fault.\n\nBut the Elder Master, heedless of the Pilgrim,\ntook a wrong path;\ninstead, he coddled the grass-bandits,\npraising the lone *\"Son of the Sun\"*—\nthus provoking the Pilgrim’s temper:\n*\"Even if there are Jade Emperor, Heavenly Kings,\nand all the gods—\nlet them come and complain,\nI fear nothing!\"*\n\nHere, the **Way** is obscured by delusion,\nand the heart runs wild with folly.\nThe tale twists and turns—\nreaders must discern its meaning.\n\n*\"The Elder Master harbors resentment,\nwhile disciples feign agreement, hide dissent\"*—\na heart that knows yet strays from truth.\n\n*\"The Three Treasures wielded his whip,\nshouting: ‘We seek lodging there!’*\nFor though his heart was set on goodness,\nhe failed to judge right from wrong—\nthus fostering robbers’ audacity,\nconfusing the **Way** and inviting evil,\nunwittingly opening the door to mischief.\n\n*\"The Pilgrim roared in fury:\n‘Leigong is my grandson,\nYechang is my great-grandson,\nMian is my great-great-grandson!’*\nHere, pride swells his tongue,\nwhile madness seizes his spirit.\n\n*\"Master and disciples ate their meal in the hut,\nwhen the Elder asked of his lineage—\nthe Pilgrim replied:\n‘Such a worthless son?\nWhy keep him?\nLet me hunt him down\nand strike him dead instead!’\nA heart that would purge evil\nyet wanders beyond restraint.\n\n*\"Yang the Just gathered his men to raid the gate;\nseeing the white steed,\nhe questioned its origin,\nlearning the **Sutra**-taking monk\nhad sought shelter here—\nthen burst from the hut,\nclapping and laughing:\n‘Brothers! Fortune!\nFortune!\nMy enemy is in my home!’\"\n\n「”His emotions stirred, and the thief appeared—\nthe thief appeared, and the **Dao** grew obscured—\nthe **Dao** obscured, and his spirit ran wild.\nWithin his own home,\nnot to let go was itself to let go.\n\n*\"The old man let the Master and disciples escape,\nbut the bandit soldiers caught up with the Elder.*\nThe Pilgrim said:\n‘Fear not, fear not.’”\nTo let go yet not let go,\nnot to let go yet let go—\nall in letting go.\n\nThe Great Sage raised his **Golden Hoop Staff**,\nstriking down many bandits.\nThe Elder, atop his steed,\nsaw this in alarm and fled his horse westward.\nThe Pilgrim seized the villain’s head\nand presented it before the Tang Monk’s steed.\n\n*\"With intent to exterminate evil,\nyet his mind was mad—\nmadness in mind,\nand his spirit ran wild.”*\n\nAll because of his intent to *\"stir up the crowd\"*,\nto *\"seek him out and strike him down\"*—\nthe letting go was itself the letting go.\n\n*\"The Elder chanted the **Tight-Fitting Fillet Spell**,\nsaying, ‘I have no need of you now—\nreturn whence you came.’*\nThe Pilgrim cried:\n‘Do not recite! Do not recite!\nI am going!’\nThe moment he spoke ‘going,’\nhe vanished.\n\n*\"To recite the spell was meant to still the mind,\nyet now he chanted to let it loose—\nproving that to recite was to let go with intent,\nto let go with harm in mind.\nWith a heart like this,\nhe could not embody the principle of **‘tranquil stillness, utterly free from thought’**,\nthus the conclusion:\n‘**The heart’s ferocity and madness leave the elixir unripe,\nthe spirit’s lack of steadfastness makes the Dao unattainable.**’\n\n**Fifty-Seventh Chapter**\n*The True Pilgrim Complains of His Sufferings at Mount Lava*\n*The False Monkey King Copies the Script at the Water Curtain Cave*」\n\nThe **Awakened One** said: *\"The Dragon Clan Master spoke: ‘The greatest affliction of humanity lies in having a body; if I had no body, what affliction would remain?’ But I say: The greatest affliction of humanity lies in having a mind; if I had no mind, what affliction would remain?’*\n\n*The *Nanhua Jing* [Zhuangzi] says: ‘I guard my form and forget my body, gaze at turbid water and lose myself in the clear depths.’ But I say: I guard my mind and forget my body, gaze at turbid water and lose myself in the clear depths. Why so?*\n\n*The mind’s presence is the grasping of **dharma**. The mind’s presence as unvirtuous is the grasping of **non-dharma**; the mind’s presence as virtuous is the grasping of **non-non-dharma**. All sages, through **non-doing as dharma**, distinguish subtly—one must abandon **non-dharma**, abandon **non-non-dharma**; if **dharma** is abandoned, what mind remains? Thus, without guarding, without mind, the depths of all phenomena are illuminated.*\n\n*Yet to say ‘no mind’ while letting the mind loose into **emptiness** is more harmful than having a mind. Why? Before **perfect clarity** arises, virtue and vice are confused—this is the **vast and chaotic void**. ‘The Great Sage soared in the void, advancing and retreating in difficulty; seeing the Tang Monk again, he gave no reply, seized the horse, and chanted the **Tight-Fitting Fillet Spell**.’ To let the mind loose into **emptiness** is to fall into the **vast and chaotic void**. How could one know that the **no-mind of no-mind** is both having and not having, releasing yet not releasing—thus able to reach the Western Paradise? If one is merely **vast and chaotic**, how could one go?*\n\n*The Pilgrim said: ‘Only fear that without me, you cannot reach the Western Paradise.’ The Monk replied: ‘I truly do not need you.’ Again chanting the **mantra**, he did not turn back his mind. This was true **vast and chaotic void**. The Great Sage could only rise again into the void—desiring to have no mind while also abandoning the true mind, unable to force others to awaken to this mind.*\n\n*Suddenly enlightened, he said: ‘This monk is faithless; I shall report him to Guanyin Bodhisattva.’ Guanyin is the **pure ocean of divine insight and discernment**. The Pilgrim said: ‘The Master has forgotten his duty and betrayed his gratitude, driving away his disciple and ruining a piece of virtuous destiny, without considering the suffering of black and white.’ His mind was deluded and unperceiving—how great was the harm of **no-mind**!*\n\n*The Bodhisattva said: ‘The Monk’s heart is entirely virtuous; you have slain many bandits. By my judgment, it is your own unvirtue.’ If one says the heart is entirely virtuous, then the unvirtuous mind should be abandoned. The Pilgrim said: ‘Even if I am unvirtuous, my merits should offset my crimes—I should not be driven away like this.’ If one says the mind has merits and crimes, the **anger-mind** is unvirtuous, yet even the virtuous mind is abandoned—how could this be right?*\n\n*This reporting to Guanyin Bodhisattva was not a complaint, but in the place of divine insight and wisdom, the heart’s proper abandonment and non-abandonment were analyzed, and its subtle principle was determined. Only when the **Tight-Fitting Fillet Spell** was recited was the mind truly unbound, returning to its original nature. Yet ‘the **Tight-Fitting Fillet Spell** was transmitted by the Tathagata, but there is no **Loosening Fillet Spell**’—without a spell to transmit, it arises naturally, and without reaching the Tathagata’s realm, liberation is unattainable. Thus he said: ‘I shall go and petition the Tathagata to recite the **Loosening Fillet Spell**.’*\n\n*Marvelous, the Bodhisattva! Neither abandonment nor loosening was possible, so she said: ‘Stay here for now.’ ‘Seated upon the lotus throne, directing the mind through the **Three Realms**, with wisdom-eyes gazing afar, encompassing the universe.’ This is as the *Vajra Sutra* says: ‘One must dwell thus, subduing the mind in this way’—already hinting at the subtle realm of **no-mind**. ‘In an instant, she spoke: “Sun Wukong, your master will soon face bodily harm; he will come to seek you shortly. You must remain here—I will tell the Tang Monk to return with you to fetch the scriptures and fulfill your true destiny.”’ The Great Sage bowed in submission, standing at the foot of the lotus throne.*\n\n*Ah! A mind of pure clarity is the Buddha’s true meaning; **calm-abiding and insight** are inseparable, dwelling in the **Three Refuges** of the mind. To release yet not release is the truth of **no-mind**. Thus the chapter’s theme is declared: ‘The True Pilgrim complains of his sufferings at Mount Lava.’*\n\n*The Monk left the village at the fifth watch, both hungry and thirsty; the Foolish One leapt into the air, carefully observing—yet saw no trace of the village. This was the spirit not guarding its dwelling, having a dwelling yet not seeing it, observing falsely. Desiring to ease hunger but unable to obtain alms; desiring to quench thirst but unable to find water—this was the false realm of **no-mind**. Thus he suddenly saw the False Pilgrim and took him for the True; saw false water and took it for true; heard the False Pilgrim’s words ‘without me, you cannot reach the Western Paradise’ and believed it was the True coming to harass him; saw the False Pilgrim’s changing expression and took it for the True’s; saw the False Pilgrim’s cudgel striking his back and believed it was the True. In his own delusion, how could he avoid being dazed and confused on the ground, losing his satchel and scriptures without knowing? This was the harm of **no-mind**, unable to distinguish virtue, vice, truth, or falsehood.*\n\n*Eight Rules begged for alms to obtain food, and in a moment of **no-mind**, saw a grass hut and begged for rice, changing his appearance; having filled his bowl, he met Sand Monk drawing water, joyfully returning. He thought his mind was pure, free from defilement, as if he had obtained a full bowl. How could he know that ‘the white horse broke free, neighing and galloping beside the road, while the baggage and scriptures had vanished without a trace?’*\n\nThe mind, in its pursuit of stillness, only becomes more agitated—just as the False can disrupt the True in this way.\n\nEight Rules said, *\"It must be the True Pilgrim’s remaining bandits, come here to strike and kill my master, and steal the baggage!\"*\nSand Monk replied, *\"My master’s life has not yet been harmed.\"*\nThe Elder exclaimed, *\"You damned monkey! You’re the one who killed me!\"*\n\nHe blamed the True for driving away the bandits, yet never faulted the False for driving away the True.\nHe knew the master’s life was unharmed, yet failed to see that the master had already lost his mind.\nHe saw the True striking him, yet did not see the False striking him in his likeness.\nHe did not see himself driving away the True, yet allowed the False to strike him in the True’s likeness.\nThis led to the False striking him and stealing his satchel, yet he took it as the True striking him and stealing his satchel.\n\nMaster and disciples alike were blind and deluded—all because of **no-mind**.\n\nEight Rules wished to reclaim his satchel and rest his master in a place of alms.\nThe woman said, *\"Just now you said you were going from the Eastern Lands to the Western Heaven—why is there another now?\"*\nEight Rules laughed, *\"It is I!\"*\n\nFor there is but one mind, yet true and false are divided—how could there be two?\nIf the True departs, the False arrives; if the False arrives, all actions and perceptions are but False.\n\nWhen Sand Monk said, *\"I’ll go, I’ll go,\"*\nhe too was not exempt from wandering into the realm of the False.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Though the body lingers, the spirit flees without guarding its dwelling,\nA furnace stands empty—how can it forge the elixir without fire?\nThe Five Phases of generation and restraint act without harmony,\nOnly when the mind-monkey returns to its pass does the Way proceed.\"*\n\nThe False Pilgrim was but an empty vessel of the Law’s form,\nyet the True’s spirit did not abide—like an empty furnace without flame to refine.\nThough the ingredients were present, the Five Phases each clashed in opposition—\nhow could their nature ever yield the elixir?\nIt must await the True’s mind returning to temper the spirit’s course,\nonly then could the Dao/Way be forged through divine alchemy.\n\nSand Monk arrived straight at the Peach Blossom Spring’s Water Curtain Cave,\nwhere he saw the True seated high upon a stone platform,\nreciting the scriptures again and again.\nThe True lifted his head and did not recognize Sand Monk,\nshouting, *\"Seize him! Seize him!\"*\n\nHe mistook the False for the True, yet the True had departed—\nthough he recognized the True at every moment, he still did not see him.\nHe mistook the True for the False, yet the False had arrived—\nthough he raised his head to meet the True, he still saw the False.\n\nThe False Pilgrim declared:\n*\"I struck the False Pilgrim and stole his baggage—\nnot because I failed to ascend to the Western Heaven,\nnor because I loved this place.\nNow that I’ve mastered the scriptures,\nI’ll journey alone to the Western Lands to worship the Buddha and seek the sutras,\nand deliver them back to the Eastern Lands.\nI’ve achieved this alone—\nlet the people of the Southern Continent [South Jambudvīpa] erect me as their ancestor,\nand my name shall endure through the ages!\"*\n\nWonderful! Marvelous!\n\nThe one who achieves success alone, desiring to cultivate the Dao in solitary unity, is merely indulging in the delusion of the wandering mind;\nthe one who seeks to establish an ancestor and transmit a name, fixating on self-centered transmission of the scriptures, fails to grasp the true essence of *wu-xin* [無心].\n\nSand Monk laughed and said, *\"There has never been a saying of 'Sun Wukong seeking the sutras.'\"*\nIf one claims Wukong could obtain the sutras, then enlightenment could come from mere thought—why then did the Tathāgata command the Golden Cicada to journey east to west, and entrust the protection of three disciples?\n\nWas it not a waste of divine thought, with no practical use?\nHere lies the hidden meaning of the next section: *\"The difficulty of cultivating true stillness in solitary unity.\"*\n\nThus, the False Pilgrim declared, *\"Worthy brother, you know only one aspect, not the two.*\nThe single mind is true; the dual mind is false.\nThe solitary unity is false; the dual unity is true.\nHow can you know one without knowing the other?\"\nThis profound duality permeates the text before and after—do not read it lightly!\n\nHe further said, *\"Do I not have a Tang Monk?\"*\nThose who fail to recognize the subtlety of the true mind, abandoning truth for falsehood, will manifest falsehood in their own hearts.\nIf Tang Monk is false, Eight Rules is false, Sand Monk is false, the White Horse is false—once falsehood takes root, all is false.\n\nSeeking the Buddha in the Western Lands and obtaining the sutras is but empty words—how could one physically reach that realm?\nThus it is said: *\"The False Monkey King copied the scriptures from the Water Curtain Cave.\"*\n*\"Sand Monk killed the False Monk\"*—this reveals the true soil.\n*\"To the South Sea to worship the Bodhisattva\"*—this is the sincere intent to trace the origin and exhaust the source.\n*\"Suddenly seeing Wukong standing beside him\"*—this shows that the true mind never leaves the Pure Land, and true intent naturally aligns with the true mind.\n\nThe Bodhisattva said, *\"When Wukong arrived here, four days have already passed.\nI never allowed him to return—how could there be another Tang Monk summoned to seek the sutras on his own?\"*\n*\"Go with Wukong to take a look.\nWhat is truly difficult to extinguish is falsehood; what is easily removed is falsehood.\"*\n\nFor seeking the sutras requires a true monk, and a true monk must possess a true mind.\nWhen true and false are confused and one cannot deeply discern the heart, one cannot deeply recognize the true self.\n\nAlas! In the fifty-eighth installment—*\"Two Hearts Disrupt the Great Cosmic Order\"*—*\"The Difficulty of Cultivating True Stillness in Solitary Unity\"*—\nMaster Wujī said: *\"Man has but one mind; those with mind possess this mind, those without mind also possess this mind.\nWith mind, there is true and false within the mind;\nwithout mind, there is true and false within the absence of mind.\nTheir forms and functions are identical.\nIf one cannot extinguish falsehood and adhere to truth, the two minds will clash in confusion, unable to distinguish right from wrong—how then can one gather the Five Phases to cultivate true stillness?\"*\n\nThe brushstrokes of this passage all depict the chaos of the two minds, yet the key focus lies in the phrase *\"the difficulty of cultivating in solitary unity.\"*\nFor the secret of *\"the difficulty of solitary cultivation\"* lies within *\"the disturbance of the two minds.\"*\nThus, only after the Monkey is struck down does the text clarify *\"once again in harmony, united in heart\"*—six words that encapsulate the essence of gathering the Five Phases to refine the elixir.\n\nThe Master’s teaching transcends the divine—it pierces through the demonic and uproots the celestial root!\n\nWukong and Sand Monk’s *\"two streams of light\"*—one rooted in genuine conscience, the other harboring doubt—already illuminate the meaning of *\"harmony in heart and intent.\"*\n*\"The two examined outside the cave and saw a pilgrim identical in every way.\"*\nThis was when the Triple Gem released the true Wukong, bringing him along as well.\n*\"Mingled together, indistinguishable as true or false\"*—this lies hidden within one’s own solitude, something no outsider can discern for them.\n\nThus, even the divine vision of the Falling Rock Mountain spirit could not perceive it.\nWhy?\nBecause the two minds are one mind, and external observation cannot unify them.\n\nEven reciting the tight-fitting cauldron incantation could not expose it.\nWhy?\nBecause the two minds originate from one mind, and no incantation can forcibly separate them.\n\nEven with the divine eyes of the celestial hosts or the Mirror of Demonic Detection, it remains indistinct.\nWhy?\nBecause the two minds belong to one Wukong—vision cannot exhaust its depths, nor can the mirror’s reflection reach its limits.\n\nEven *\"knowing oneself as a friend does\"*—later shifts in stance, hidden and revealed emotions—cannot be fixed;\n*\"knowing one’s younger brother as a teacher does\"*—sudden unity and separation, coming and going unpredictably—cannot be measured.\n\nHow profound is the difficulty of distinguishing true and false minds!\nFor they dwell in the most profound and obscure realms, beyond what can be observed through external appearances.\nThus, one must seek them within the profound and obscure.\n\nEntering the Forest of the Dead’s Hall of Records, one searches for them in the Monkey Ledger—\nand if there are no two minds, there is not even one mind, already erased in the chaos of the Great Uproar!\n\nSpeaking of the truth of *wu-xin* [無心], one realizes the two minds are both delusion.\nTo dwell and listen, the true essence will naturally reveal itself.\nThus, Dìzhàng Bodhisattva said, *\"Wait! Wait!\nLet me listen closely to discern truth from falsehood for you.\"*\n\n*Dì* [谛] listening—what others cannot know, yet you alone perceive.\n*Dì* listening, bowing in silence, soon recognizing the strange.\nIt is not called *\"seeing\"* but *\"listening,\"* nor merely *\"listening\"* but *\"close listening.\"*\nRejecting sharp hearing and bright sight, using the heart’s profound listening—this is the breadth of insight and the height of perception.\n\nAgain, *\"Do not expose it directly; do not assist in capturing him.\"*\nWhy?\nBecause the heart has the power of self-deception, and there is no method to bind the heart.\nHe who knows this heart possesses this heart;\nhe who is ignorant of this knowing also possesses this heart.\n\nThe two hearts contend, the heart refusing to obey the knowing—\ninstead, it rebels against knowing and disturbs the spirits of the dark depths,\nso he cannot be captured.\n\nThe *Dì* listening as spoken is truly the *Dì* truth—\nit must not be disrespected or neglected in listening.\n\n*\"The Buddha-Dharma is boundless,\"*\nalready pointing directly to the marvelous realm of no-heart,\nwhere the two hearts together cause harm.\n\nThe verse says:\n*\"A man with two hearts breeds calamity,\nacross lands and seas, suspicion and doubt arise.\nHe dreams of jade steeds in the Three Exalted Offices,\nthen counts the golden palanquin of the First Rank.\nNorthward campaigns and southern raids—all futile strife,\neastward and westward fleeting like the serpent’s coils—\nleft and right, ‘wū’ and ‘guì.’*\nThe Zen gate must master the secret of no-heart,\ncultivating stillness to nourish the infant’s sacred essence.\n\nCarefully ponder the last two lines—\nknow that no-heart alone is the One,\nthe true heart not belonging to the heart.\n\nTest listening as the Buddha expounds the Dharma—\nwith both presence and absence unestablished,\nform and emptiness leaning on neither,\nonly then attaining the marvelous sound.\n\nThe two hearts battle fiercely to the realm of thunderous hearing,\nwhere the great assembly listens to their two voices—\nyet none can discern.\n\nGuanyin especially came to pay homage—\nknowing the heart as heart,\nbut unaware of the four monkeys stirring the world,\ndisturbing heaven and earth.\n\nThus the Buddha smiled and said:\n*\"Your Dharma-powers are vast,\nyet you can only universally survey the affairs of the revolving heavens,\nnot thoroughly know the things of the revolving heavens,\nnor broadly gather the categories of the revolving heavens.\"*\nMeaning you cannot grasp the fullness of things,\nbut deeply understand the stirring heart of the world.\n\n*\"Four monkeys\"* refers to the four wisdoms of the heart.\nThe luminous clarity originates from the primordial heaven,\nknowledge arises from the subsequent heaven.\nFrom the presence of subsequent knowledge,\nthe primordial luminous clarity is disturbed by it,\nso the knowledge-heart must be extinguished,\nand the luminous clarity-heart will then manifest itself.\n\nThe false awakening of emptiness is the six-eared macaque—\nthe term for *\"six consciousnesses.\"*\nThe Buddha did not allow this six-consciousness to arise,\ncovering the bowl and alms-basket with the round emptiness vessel,\nrevealing its true form—\nstriking with the luminous clarity-heart,\na single blow to the head, killing the heart.\nThe marvelous *Dì* of the dead heart is thus.\n\nYet this kind remains extant to this day,\nand those who say *\"this kind is utterly extinct today\"*—\nit is because the Buddha’s bowl and alms-basket,\nand the golden cudgel of the false awakening of emptiness,\nstill exist to extinguish it today.\n\nThe *Book of Documents* states:\n*\"Unknowing and unrecognizing, follow the Dao of the Emperor.\"*\n\nThe *Book of Poems* says:\n*\"The Supreme Lord watches over you—\ndo not let your heart be divided.\"*\n\n「\"Recognizing and knowing are not the marvelous Dao/Way of the transmitted heart—\nthe single heart is the Supreme Lord’s heavenly heart.\n\nOnce the false practitioner is eliminated,\nthe false Tang Monk and false Eight Rules are struck down together—\nthen the heart has no divergent inclinations,\nand the Dao/Way may be subtly cultivated.\n\nDiscard the heart’s semblance of the Dao/Way,\nilluminate the Dao/Way’s harmony with the heart,\nand elucidate the essential principle of unified mind and intention—\nrefining the true mechanism of the Five Phases’ convergence;\npreparing the chariot and steeds,\nthe Great Dao/Way is in sight.\n\nThus it concludes:\n*\"The Great Dao/Way, midway, departs from chaotic Five Phases,\nsubduing demons to gather in the unified luminous essence.\nDivine returns to the heart, abandoning meditation’s fixed path,\nsix consciousnesses purged, the elixir naturally forms.\"*\nThis is the *\"true Nirvana\"* of true meditation,\nthe *\"one body, hard to cultivate\"* of its profound intent.\n\n**The Fifty-Ninth Chapter: Tang Monk obstructed by the Fire-Flame Mountain**\n**Sun Monk adjusts the Banana-Leaf Fan**\n\nThe Awakened One said:\n*\"Dual-heartedness is not merely the mingling of Dao-heart and human heart,\nnor just the Dao-heart’s feeble doubt at halfway—\nit is also not just one person with two hearts,\nbut three disciples with three hearts,\nand those who fail to align with the Tang Monk.*\n\n*Why?*\n*For the three families must unite as one to form the embryo.*\n*If only one body cultivates alone,\nit is hard to attain true Nirvana.*\n\nThus:\n*\"The Three Treasures followed the Bodhisattva’s teaching,\nretrieving the Monk and severing the Eight Rules’ and Sha Monk’s dual hearts,\nlocking away the monkey-steed,\nuniting their efforts to press onward toward the Western Heaven.\"*\n\n*This chapter links the previous meditation on nature’s essence,*\n*and sets forth the subsequent marvelous cultivation of life.*\n\n*The Fire-Flame Mountain of this passage*\n*is the true Yang’s ascending flame.*\n*True Yang must be aided by true Yin to achieve balance,*\n*and thus generate all things.*\n*If Yang is one-sided without Yin,*\n*then the ultimate Dao/Way loses its center,*\n*the dharma-nature remains incomplete,*\n*though one may possess myriad thoughts and deliberations,*\n*they will still result in illusion.*\n\n*Wandering east and west on false paths,*\n*how can one gather the golden elixir,*\n*and refine it into the Great Dao/Way?*\n*The opening line specially declares:*\n*\"If myriad natures originally share the same essence,\nthe sea holds boundless capacity.\"*\n\n*It speaks of the unity of human and self—*\n*not separable from humanity alone.*\n*\"Thousand thoughts and deliberations end in delusion,*\n*all colors and forms merge indistinctly.\"*\n\n*It speaks of the divine mind and all colored forms,*\n*all becoming illusion—*\n*must be dissolved without trace.*\n*\"When the day’s labor is complete and the path fulfilled,*\n*the round and luminous dharma-nature ascends supreme.\"*\n\n*It speaks of knowing that human and self share the same nature,*\n*and that unified cultivation of body and mind,*\n*when labor is complete and the path fulfilled,*\n*will bring forth the unsurpassed round dharma-nature.*\n\n*\"Do not let differences stray east and west,*\n*lock them tightly in the cage.*\n*Bring them back to settle within the elixir furnace,*\n*refine them into the golden phoenix’s hue—*\n*as red as flame.\"*\n\n*It speaks of this path from east to west,*\n*the sole way for seeking the scriptures,*\n*do not let differences stray east and west.*\n*Diligently cultivate, returning all to your own furnace,*\n*then you may refine your own Yin elixir of the golden phoenix,*\n*and attain the same hue as the Yang elixir.*\n\n*\"Luminous and radiant, delicate and resplendent,*\n*let me ride the dragon in and out at will.\"*\n\n*It speaks of attaining this round and radiant essence,*\n*the original source of all—*\n*let me ascend to heaven upon the dragon at will.*\n\nThe Three Treasures inquired:\n*\"Why does autumn still have heat?\"*\n\nThe Eight Rules wondered if it were the country of *Sīhāli* (Shahāli),\nwhere the sun sets;\n\nThe Sha Monk suspected it was due to *falling into summer order*.\n\nSeeing the redness of the farmstead by the roadside,\nit was merely the color of the Fire-Flame Mountain’s heat—\nno deeper meaning.\n\nThe old man said:\n*\"Our land is hot in all four seasons,\nit is the necessary path to the Western Realm.\"*\n\n*He reveals that those who seek the elixir*\n*must pass through this true Yang region,*\n*refining and tempering it,*\n*and abandon all other paths for seeking the scriptures.*\n\n*\"Red chariot,\"*\n*\"hot breath of the cake,\"*\n*again alludes to the fiery hue.*\n\n*The secret of entering the fire and sowing seeds*\n*requires true Yin to aid,*\n*only then can they be nurtured,*\n*hence the saying:*\n*\"If you wish for cake’s flour and rice,*\n*respectfully seek the Iron-Fan Sage.\"*\n\n*The Banana-Leaf Fan, once waved,*\n*stills the fire,*\n*twice waved, raises the wind,*\n*thrice waved, brings forth the rain—*\n*the meaning of the Three Yins arising,*\n*and the *Kūn* Dao/Way being fulfilled.*\n\n*The Iron-Fan Sage resides in the southwest,*\n*on the Jade-Green Cloud Mountain,*\n*within the Banana-Leaf Cave.*\n*The southwest is the *Kūn* direction,*\n*as the *Yìjīng* says:*\n*\"The southwest gains companions.\"*\n\n*\"Jade-Green Cloud,\"*\n*\"Banana-Leaf,\"*\n*borrowed to convey the meaning of a verdant, cool cave,*\n*able to dispel the summer’s heat.*\n\n*\"Red flowers, inner and outer alike,*\n*truly sought, only then obtained,\"*\n*is the same as:*\n*\"To seek celestial treasures,*\n*one must use worldly wealth.\"*\n\n*The woodcutter spoke of knowing the Iron-Fan Princess*\n*is the *Luo Sā* (Rākṣasī) woman,*\n*the wife of the Bull Demon King,*\n*and Sun Monk was startled.*\n\n*Borrowing the fan’s difficulty,*\n*he recalled the tale of the Red Boy*\n*and the Broken Cave at the Sunlit Mountain,*\n*seeing that what the Rākṣasī loved was the Treasure of Virtue.*\n\n*Now the Treasure of Virtue is unseen,*\n*and there are no red flowers or outer/inner alike,*\n*yet he dares to borrow the fan with empty hands—*\n*is this not again the same as the Broken Cave at the Sunlit Mountain?*\n\n*\"Though the Monkey Girl may show her utmost solicitude,*\n*it cannot pacify the Rākṣasī’s rage in her heart.*\n*Only because the Treasure of Virtue is not seen,*\n*does she push open the Eight Ten Thousand Paths with a single wave.\"*\n\n*The dialogue between Sun Monk and the Rākṣasī*\n*is a segment-by-segment, winding description,*\n*all implying that to seek true treasures,*\n*one must have wealth—*\n*no matter how clever in words or forceful in action,*\n*it is all in vain.*\n\n*Sun Monk was blown by the Yin wind to the Xiao Xūmǐ Mountain,*\n*and sighed:*\n*\"What a formidable woman!\"*\n\n*Knowing she could not be approached lightly,*\n*yet not easily approached either.*\n\n*He remembered the Venerable Lingjì Bodhisattva,*\n*who, when inquiring about the path and progress,*\n*spoke of the Banana-Leaf Fan as:*\n*\"The Banana-Leaf Fan was originally*\n*a divine treasure of Kunlun Mountain,*\n*from the time of Chaos’s primordial opening.*\n*It is the essence of the Great Yin,*\n*hence its power to extinguish fire.\"*」\n\nThe essence of Great Yin’s true water\nclearly subdues the true fire of fierce flames.\nIf one employs the treasure of calming winds\nwith proper method to obtain it,\nwhat need be feared of not achieving great success?\nThe Lingjì’s aid with the Calming-Wind Pill\nis indeed an essential practice for sincere cultivation.\n\nHaving obtained the Calming-Wind Pill,\nSun Monk then borrowed the fan,\nstacking three together—\nunshaken, as a stable foundation brings peace,\na prosperous land and contented people,\nseeking battle to gain from others\nwhile suffering no loss to oneself.\n\n*\"Clutching the pill in his mouth,\nhe transformed into a cicada,\nentering her belly.\"*\n\nThis speaks of utter sincerity,\nplacing one’s heart within another’s,\nso that no secrets remain—\nas if seeing their very lungs and liver—\nonly then can mutual aid be attained.\n\nThis is not achieved through deceitful tricks,\nbut through genuine sincerity that moves the heart.\n\nSun Monk said:\n*\"I, Old Monkey, have never practiced deceitful arts—\nonly true methods, genuine power,\nalready playing within your honored wife’s womb,\nalready seeing her lungs and liver.\"*\n\nThis is the divine interplay of inherent principle and qi,\nnot the result of contrived techniques.\n\n*—As in the* **Odes***.*\n\nThe lines *\"式饮庶几\"*, *\"式食庶几\"*—\nthis is the art of touching hearts with sincerity.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"I know you are thirsty,\nso here’s a bowl to drink—\nlet it quench your thirst.\"*\n\nAnd again:\n*\"Now here’s a bite to eat—\nlet it fill your hunger.\"*\n\nSuch delicate, respectful metaphors of true sincerity—\na brushstroke of divine calligraphy,\na dance of immortal ink—\nthese are the joys of the literati!\n\nYet when I seek with sincerity,\nand they respond with falsehood—\nwhat then?\n\nThe Demoness of the Sandstorm had already spoken:\n*\"Your vengeance against me remains unfulfilled,\nand how could I ever lend you my fan\nas you wish?\"*\n\n*Child* (子) is the breath of the mother (母).\nIf the mother does not see her child,\nthen no kindness can please her heart.\n\nThough they use my respectful heart,\nthey do not employ my true affection.\nThey may grant me the fan,\nbut not the *true fan*—\nfor their emotions are not fully surrendered,\nand the precious treasure still hides itself.\nAll because I have not yet understood them deeply.\n\nThus, the Pilgrim takes the false fan,\nunable to discern its nature,\nand misuses it—\nfirst fan, second fan, third fan—\nwhile the flames grow ever fiercer.\n\nFor fire is the path to scripture-taking,\nand since he cannot find a way without fire,\nthe fan is the treasure of true yin\nto temper the flames of passion.\nYet he cannot borrow what is useless—\nhe must depend on his own strength,\nas in *\"seeing the golden husband but not possessing him.\"*\n\nThe old man with the *upside-down moon crown*—\nhe alone knows the true treasures within the furnace.\nThe ancient sage said:\n*\"Plucked from the upside-down moon furnace,\"*\nand there lies a profound secret.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"If you still wish to borrow the true fan,*\n*seek the Great Strength King.\"*\n\nThe meaning of seeking great strength—\nfirst, to bind and take the true yin,\nrequiring mastery over the *law treasures*;\nsecond, to restrain the wandering true yin,\nfor the Great Strength King is hard to control.\n\nThe verses contain essential keys,\nlike the divine dragon coiling in flight,\nits head and tail beyond measure.\n\n---\n**Sixty-First Chapter**\n*The Bull Demon King Ceases Battle and Attends the Banquet*\n*The Sun Wukong Twice Persuades the Fan*\n\nThus the Sage said:\n*\"The Bull Demon King is the master of true yin.*\n*To obtain true yin,*\n*one must first seek the Bull of Great Strength.\"*\n\nThe Bull is yin-earth and great strength,\nbut as a Demon King, his might is even greater—\nfor he is easily unrestrained\nand hard to capture.\n\n*The Classic of Correlating Correspondences* says:\n*\"The Great Sun flows its pearl,*\n*always desiring to leave man.*\n*Yet when it meets the Golden Phoenix,*\n*it turns and binds with it.\"*\n\nThis speaks of the yin-essence (阴精) in man’s body—\nthe pearl of the Great Sun,\nlike mercury in lead,\neasily lost.\n\nIf one can obtain the *Golden Phoenix’s yin-qi* (金华铅气) to restrain it,\nthen it may turn to temper the fire’s heat,\nbinding and stabilizing it.\n\nThis is the Bull King’s attendance at the Banquet,\nand his turn to meet the Demoness—\nthe shadowed borrowing of the Golden Phoenix’s yin-qi,\nand thus the chance to unite with true enlightenment.\n\nThe heart belongs to fire,\nthe kidneys to water.\nFire is yang, water is yin.\nThe monkey symbolizes yang,\nthe bull symbolizes yin.\n\nAt first, they share the same origin,\nthen they repel each other,\nand finally serve one another.\n*\"Five hundred years ago, we swore brotherhood,\"*\ntracing their beginnings.\n\nThe Earth Spirit said:\n*\"This fire was originally set by the Great Sage,\"*\na truth confirmed.\n\nThe eight trigrams of the Primordial Dao were inverted\nand entered into the Postnatal—\nthe fire of *Li* (離) grew dominant.\nMen see the *Li* fire’s excess,\nbut do not know it comes from their own inversion,\nthus saying: *\"You no longer recognize me.\"*\n\n*\"Five hundred years ago, when I raided the Celestial Palace,\"*\n*\"when Laozi refined me in his Eight-Trigram Furnace,\"*\n*\"when the furnace was opened and I knocked over the remaining flames,\"*\n*\"I was the Daoist who guarded the furnace.\"*\nHis words are clear and well-reasoned,\nnot a forced argument.\n\nThe *Li* fire cannot temper the flames of passion\nwithout the *Kan* water (坎水),\nand thus it must seek the Great Strength\nto borrow true yin.\n\nTrue yin is water,\ngoverned by the *Xun* consort (巽女).\nWithout borrowing the Great Strength,\nit cannot be fully obtained—\nthus one must seek the Bull Demon King\nthrough all means of wealth and treasure.\n\nYet those with great strength\nmust be tempted by external desires.\n\n*\"Now residing at Accumulated Thunder Mountain in Cloud-Drift Cave,\"*\nspeaking of thunder stirring the clouds,\nof rain falling at will—\nof unrestrained lust.\n\n*\"The Jade-Faced Princess, with a hundred thousand treasures,\"*\nspeaking of wealth and beauty together,\nand desires easily indulged.\n\n*\"Abandoning the Demoness, never looking back,\"*\nspeaking of neglecting true yin,\nof never returning.\n\nThe flames grow fiercer,\nwith nothing to temper them.\n\n*\"Seeking the Bull King, bowing to beg his aid here,*\n*only then can I borrow the true fan—*\nfor one must restrain desire,\ncontrol emotions,\nguard true yin without losing it,\nas husband and wife remain inseparable,\nonly then can true yin be obtained\nto temper the flames.\"*\n\n*\"Accumulated Thunder Mountain lies to the south,\"*\nthe position of *Li*—\nthe place of postnatal true yin,\na secondary consort in the outer chamber,\nnot like the Iron Fan’s original mate,\nwho holds the true fan of the Primordial Dao.\n\n*\"The Pilgrim searched for clues,*\n*and suddenly saw beneath the pine shade*\n*a woman of extraordinary beauty,*\n*plucking a fragrant osmanthus branch,*\n*gracefully swaying as she approached.\"*\nA true sign of yin-essence manifesting.\n\nWhen he feigned curiosity to inquire,\nused pretexts to provoke anger,\nand then frightened away her attendants,\nwhen he embraced her and played coy,\nwhen he wept, laughed, and spoke tenderly—\nall her emotions were vividly depicted,\nas if one could see her form,\nhear her very words.\n\nThus it is made clear:\nhow alluring objects move the heart,\nworthy of love and pity;\nhow the Bull’s attachment\nmelts the soul and steals the breath.\n\nThe Bull King met the Pilgrim,\nexchanged old greetings and warm words,\nand explained the reason for the son’s journey to Bliss—\nnow the son’s worthiness of renunciation was clear.\n\nThe Bull King spoke:\n*\"The grief of harming my child,\nyou have already spoken of;\nyet you deceived me with my beloved consort,\nstormed my gate—why so?\"*\n\nHe plainly declared that the son could be renounced,\nyet beauty must be seized—\nthus revealing how the Bull’s devotion to color\nled him to perish for its sake.\n\nThe Great Sage begged for aid and relief,\nasked to borrow the fan to quell the flames,\nand spoke of *\"brother’s heart of opening heaven and earth,\nleading little brother to visit the elder sister.\"*\n\nHe spoke of *Kan* and *Li* aiding and renouncing—\nthis was the heart of heaven and earth;\nhusband leading, wife following—\nthis was the Way of yin and yang.\n\nIf the elder brother did not visit the elder sister,\ntrue yin would not be seen,\nand true yang would not be aided.\n\nThe Bull King, enraged by deceit of wife and destruction of consort,\nfiercely contested—\nall to show his love of beauty and hatred of virtue.\n\nWhen he heard the request to *\"come quickly to the feast,\"*\nhe abandoned battle for the banquet—\nfor once lost to color,\nhe would surely drown in wine,\none obsession replacing another.\n\nHis spirit and emotions were in chaos.\nLost in the watery abyss, rampaging wildly—\nhow could he not lose his own supporting strength?\n\nYet wine is water-gold.\nObtaining the Golden Flower,\nhe ceased his battle,\nand there was room for change and transformation.\n\nThus the Pilgrim ultimately gained the Golden-Eyed Beast,\nand transformed the Bull Demon King;\nthe Demon King ultimately gained the Scattered Flower Feast,\nand came to meet the Rakshasa.\n\n*\"The Green Wave Pool among the chaotic rocks,\"*\neven in filth, there is purity;\n*\"The crab and shellfish know no decorum,\"*\nyet even in recklessness, there is order.\n\nThe Great Sage stole the beast and transformed its form,\nthen directly arrived at the Banana Grove.\nThe reader may think this was a trick—borrowing the true fan’s illusory technique—\nbut in truth, he seized the very principle of *yin* essence.\n\nThe Fire-Eyed Sage, with his Golden-Eyed Beast,\nstraddling the Water-Splitting Beast—\nwater and fire now share a meeting in form.\n\nThe Monkey-Heart takes it as heart,\nthe Bull-Demon as body—\nheart and *yin* now intermingle in harmony.\n\nWhen seeing his old wife again,\nher affection only deepens;\nwhen the wife sees her golden husband,\ntheir bonds grow ever tighter.\n\nThough their union is borrowed in form,\nthe principle holds true essence—\nhow could the treasure not naturally reveal itself?\nThere lies a natural marvel beyond artifice.\n\nThey mimic the joy of reunited spouses,\npostures brimming with life—\nsometimes laughter hides a trace of jealousy,\nsometimes solemnity conceals coquettishness;\nsometimes feigned anger betrays true affection,\nsometimes playful pique draws out honest words.\n\nHand in hand, cheeks pressed warm,\nthey leap like twin fish playing in water;\nclouds and rain in their glances—\nalmost too vivid to wash clean the Twelve Peaks of Wu.\n\nThe reader may say they’ve captured the intimate tenderness of married love,\nyet they’ve overlooked the profound allegory.\n\nShe says: *“Your Majesty favors your new bride,\nabandoning me—what wind today blew you here?”*\nSpeaking of loving an external wife while neglecting the inner one—\na fortunate turn when he finally looks back.\n\nShe says: *“I never meant to abandon you—\nonly that Princess Jade-Face was crowned queen,\nhousehold affairs grew burdensome,\nand friends demanded my attention,\nso I lingered outside—\nyet I’ve even set up another household.”*\nSpeaking of being seduced by wealth and desire,\nlingering in distraction,\nunable to turn inward,\nthus making the outer heavy and the inner light.\n\nThen, feigning anger, she scolds: *“When did that damned monkey pass through?”*\nAnd slaps her chest: *“Alas! Alas!\nMy lord was wrong—\nhow could you give this treasure to that monkey?”\n“It kills me!”*\nSpeaking of the Way of the Pilgrimage—\nwithout true *yin*, one cannot advance.\nHow could one pass without the true fan?\nAnd how could one obtain the true fan without me?\nIf the wife had given the treasure,\nthat would be a true mistake.\n\n「Then she says: *“My lord, you are newly married to the Great Sovereign—\ndo not forget your true bond of *yin* and *yang*,\nand drink a cup of this native *yang* water.”*\nSpeaking of how the true *yin* and *yang* within one’s body are like the bond of marriage,\nwhile the *yin* and *yang* outside are like foreign waters—\none must not indulge in fleeting desires\nand forget the source of one’s true essence.\n\nThen she says: *“I, due to my concern for external governance,\nhave been long separated from my lord,\nyet night and day I guard and protect your ancestral domain.”*\nSpeaking of when *yin* and *yang* lose their proper alignment,\nand one must bolster the *yang* essence—\nthis requires strengthening the *yin* foundation.\n\nThen she says: *“‘Kang’ (康) is harmony (齐).\n‘My lord is the *yang* parent that nurtures the body.’”*\nSpeaking of how *yin* and *yang* in perfect balance\nbring forth the flourishing of all things;\ntrue *yin* without *yang* cannot sustain and nourish the ten thousand beings.\n\nWhen they stand side by side, leaning down to embrace,\nand speak in unison to nourish the treasure,\nclinging to each other in intimacy,\nand reveal the *bao-bei* (宝贝),\nthe profound interplay of *yang* revering *yin*\nand the mutual devouring of opposites\nis beyond mere description or analogy.\n\nThe Great Sage gains the treasure,\nlost in dark musings and divine contemplation,\nwhile the Demon Queen, drunk on wine,\nspeaks of true sentiment and principle.\n\nFor the treasure is originally my family’s heirloom—\nyet through reckless indulgence and dissipation,\nI lost sight of its true nature,\nand now cannot even recognize it.\n\nThus the Demon Queen says:\n*“Great King, you must have been day and night lost in pleasure,\nyour mind clouded by that Princess Jade-Face,\nso how could you forget even your own treasure?”*\n\nFor those in the world who live in dreams or drunkenness,\nthese few words can serve as a sharp awakening.\n\n*“With the left thumb holding seven strands,\nchanting ‘□ left “mouth” (口), right “four” (四),\nhush, exhale, inhale, laugh, blow, breathe’—\nit instantly grows two zhang and two chi in length.\nThis treasure transforms endlessly—\na fire of eight hundred *li*,\nwhich can be extinguished with a single fan.”*\nSpeaking of restraining the seven emotions,\nwhile channeling the singular *qi* (气) of the fingers—\ntrue *yang* then flourishes,\nand its boundless transformations unfold,\nas the nine palaces and eight trigrams\nare all but manifestations of this *yang* water’s wondrous effects.\nExtinguishing flames and tempering heat—\nwhat could be more difficult?\n\nThe Great Sage holds the true treasure in hand,\ndemonstrating its methods,\nyet lacking the incantation,\nhe clutches it to his shoulder.\nThis cannot be swallowed whole,\nnor transformed at will—\nthus he cannot keep it without losing it again.\n\nThe Bull Demon King scatters the feast,\nthe Water-Beast having been stolen,\nyet the lead is dispersed and true *mercury* (真汞) loses control.\nThe cause of the Crab’s reckless rampage is understood,\nand the scheme of Monkey’s theft of the beast is revealed—\nseeing remorse and regret, there remains a chance for return.\n\nRiding the clouds straight back to the Green Cloud,\nthe Demon Queen shouts in rage: *“Heaven-damned!”*\nBoth husband and wife were careless,\nthus the true treasure was lost,\nand they are now in frantic haste.\n\nThe monkey steals the grandmother’s treasure,\nthe Bull King seizes the grandmother’s weapon—\ntrue and false *yin* and *yang* are both disordered,\nand Wood, Metal, Water, Fire all clash at once.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 61: Zhu Bajie Lends His Strength to Break the Bull Demon King\nSun Wukong’s Three Attempts to Borrow the Banana Fan**\n\nA scholar once remarked:\nReaders compare *“Three Attempts to Borrow the Banana Fan”* (三调芭蕉扇)\nwith *“Three Visits to the Thatched Hut”* (三顾茅庐)\nand *“Three Battles at Zhu’s Village”* (三打祝家庄),\nas though these were all sacred *Daoist* talismans (宝箓),\nmere set phrases in the novel.\nIt is like reading *The Strategy of the Rabbit Garden* (《兔园策》)\nand *The Dragon-Tiger Scripture* (《龙虎经》)\nwithout discerning their true distinctions.\n\nThe Fire-Flame Mountain descends from heaven,\nmeeting the earth—\nthis is the union of *Qian* (乾, Heaven) and *Kun* (坤, Earth),\ngiving rise to the three *yang* (阳) energies,\nthe Great Sage’s primordial *yang* *qi* (真动之气) transformed,\nas explained by the adept who guards the Eight Trigram Elixir Furnace (八卦丹炉之道人).\n\n**The First Attempt (一调):**\nThe Great Sage, dwelling in *Kun* (Earth),\nseeks to borrow from *Qian* (Heaven).\nIn the first borrowing, *Xun* (巽, Gentle Wind) is born as the eldest daughter—\n*Xun* is wind, hence the fan;\nobtained from *Qian*’s Metal (金), hence the Iron Fan Princess (铁扇公主).\nAs the eldest daughter of Earth (土),\nshe is the first *yin* (阴) to appear.\n\n**The Second Attempt (二调):**\nThe Great Sage, dwelling in *Kun* (Earth),\nborrows again.\nIn the second borrowing, *Li* (离, Fire) is born as the middle daughter—\n*Li* is fire, hence she sits in the south,\nthe symbol of a sovereign facing south,\nthus the Jade-Face Princess (玉面公主) is obtained.\nAs the middle daughter of Earth,\nshe is the second *yin* to appear.\n\n**The Third Attempt (三调):**\nThe Great Sage, dwelling in *Kun* (Earth),\nborrows a third time.\nIn the third borrowing, *Dui* (兑, Joy) is born as the youngest daughter—\n*Dui* is the marsh, the union of Water and Metal;\npositioned in the west with a white hue,\nhence the White Bull (白牛).\nThe bull belongs to Earth yet bears Metal,\ntraversing all nine palaces,\nits power vast—\nthus the Great Power King (大力王),\nthe *yang* parent that nurtures the Iron Fan Princess’s body,\nthe true *yin* sovereign—\nthus the third *yin* appears,\nand the true fan is offered.\n\nThrough *Kun*’s three borrowings,\nthree *yin* energies emerge,\nto subdue the fire and nurture all things—\nall rooted in the primordial *yin* *qi* (真乙之气).\nThis is the subtle essence of the Great Sage’s\nfirst, second, and third attempts to borrow the fan.\n\n*“If I were to demand it directly from his face,\nhe would certainly refuse.\nBut if he fans me once,\nI would be sent eight hundred and forty thousand *li* away!”*\nThis reveals how *yin* and *yang* have cycles of mutual borrowing,\nand how Earth can act as the guiding *qi* (用神).\n\nAbove, it can adapt and shift with the flow—\nEarth subdues Water in reverse borrowing,\nyet Water may also bring harm in its counterattack.\nEarth borrows Wood in false alignment,\nyet Water naturally brings growth and benefit.\n\nThus it is said:\n\n「When [the fan] is obtained in the guise of the Eight Precepts,\nthe Eight Rules (*bājiè*) intercepts the Way and ambushes the Great Sage,\ntricking him into surrendering the fan—\nnow knowing the roots of its acquisition and release,\nhe transforms as a peach kernel (*xìngpiàn*) and tosses it into his mouth.»\n\nThe Daoists regard the mouth as the Fire Flame Mountain,\nand the true *yin* enters the mouth,\nstill invoking the *Lǐ* [hexagram] symbol.\nThe practitioner seeks the true *yin* within *Lǐ*\nto achieve *Jìjí* [hexagram],\nwithout relying on Earth and Wood’s functions,\nthey cannot acquire and succeed.\n\nThus the following passage focuses on\nthe assistance of Earth and the Eight Rules (*bājiè*)\nas the backbone of action:\n*\"The Tang Monk sits upon the road,\nand the fire *qi* scorches him—\nhis heart burns, his throat parched,\"*\na lone *yang* rising to excess.\n\n*\"He questions the Earth Spirit and observes its powers,\nsummons the Eight Rules and commands them to exert effort,\nrolling up the curtain to accompany him,\"*\nfor Earth resides in the Central Palace and never departs.\n\n*\"He recognizes the path while traveling,\"*\nas Earth’s influence thrives in the south,\nits vigor borrowed and sustained.\n\n*\"When walking straight ahead,\nsuddenly, they see fighting.\nThe Earth Spirit says: ‘Tianpeng, do not advance,\nwhat else could be done?’\nThis means Earth can aid Wood,\nand when the moment arises, it acts—\nno waiting is required.*\n\n*\"The Eight Rules vanquish the Bull King,\nwhile the Earth Spirit detains the Great Strength [Sun Wukong].\"\nWood flourishes, Earth thrives—\nthe moment of their conjunction.*\n\nThe Bull King, the Great Sage, and the Eight Rules\nstrive with fierce resolve,\nforging harmony between Metal and Wood,\nthus manifesting the true *yin*—\nhence, the Jade-Faced Princess of Accumulated Thunder Mountain\ncomes to lend her strength.\n\n*\"The Eight Rules, vexed by the difficulty of obtaining the fan,\ncontemplates taking an alternate path,\"*\nlest impatience and doubt arise.\n\nThe Earth Spirit says:\n*\"Great Sage, do not grow anxious,\nTianpeng, do not slacken.\nTo speak of an alternate path\nis to enter a side door,\nnot the way of true cultivation.\nYour master sits upon the straight path,\nlongingly awaiting your success.\"*\nThis means only the Great Sage’s Metal\nand Tianpeng’s Wood,\nwhen joined and united in purpose,\ncan exert bold action\nto obtain the true *yin* Water\nand fulfill the Great Dao.\n\nIf one abandons this and seeks an alternate path,\nit is to forsake the true Dao for a side door—\nWater and Fire cannot be *Jìjí*,\nhow then could one find the path to the West and retrieve the scriptures?\n\nThis is the Dao of *Jìjí* Water and Fire,\nprecisely to sit and watch\nupon the straight path\nfor the success of Metal and Wood.\n\nThe Traveler (*Xíngzhě*) growls in agreement:\n*\"Indeed, indeed—\nyou speak with reason.\"*\nHe says: *\"Well done, the Earthly Constraints transform!\"*\nHe says: *\"Shatter the obstinate void\nand seek the Buddha’s face!\"*\nThis means to act within the *Kun* [hexagram] Palace,\nand through powers and transformations,\nto meet the Buddha—\nnot like the Chan school,\nwhich clings solely to the *xìngzōng* [nature school]\nand falls into the void of obstinacy.\n\nThe Eight Rules exerts effort and says:\n*\"What care have I for the Bull King’s coming or not?\"\nThis means to drive the Bull back to Earth,\nthe action is mine,\nwhile the Bull knows nothing.*\n\nHe says: *\"Wood in *hài* [the hour of the pig],\nits nature paired with the pig,\ndragging the Bull’s child back to Earth’s kind.\"*\nThis means Wood and Fire are paired,\n*yin* within *yang*.\nTo drag Wood and Mercury (*gōng*) back,\npreventing their wildness,\nand make them return to Earth,\nthen the true *yin* is obtained to subdue Fire—\nthis is the Eight Rules’ exertion.\n\nHe says: *\"From *shēn* [the hour of the monkey] comes Metal’s birth,\nyet without punishment or suppression,\nthere is much harmony and *qi*.\"*\nThis means Metal and Water are paired,\nclarifying the central *yang*.\n\n*\"With the banana leaf,\nas Water’s intention,\nthe Fire Flame is extinguished—*Jìjí* achieved.\"*\nThe meaning is self-evident.\n\n*\"Two lead the Earth Spirit and the *yin* soldiers,\nadvancing together,\"*\ntheir actions never stray from Earth.\n\n「Thus, in the moment when the three contend in battle, the Earth Spirit blocks the Way, saying: *\"Great Strength King, where do you flee? We are here!\"* The Old Bull and the Pilgrim engage in their own transformations and struggles, mirroring their prior contest in the Heavenly Palace with the Second Prince.\n\nThis one acts in accordance with the **Pristine Dao/Way**, following the **Heavenly Dao/Way** and the **Human Dao/Way**;\nThat one defies the **Heavenly Dao/Way**, embodying the **Dao/Way of the Immortal**.\n\nTogether, they display the marvel of one **following** and one **defying**.\n\nThe Old Bull ascends from Earth to Heaven,\nfirst ascending to the **Heavenly Dao/Way**.\nTransforming into a **celestial swan**—Heavenly Unity (*Tiānyī*) generates Water,\nWater generates Wood, in **harmony**;\nThe Pilgrim transforms into a **sea-eastern green**—the **eastern green** is Wood,\nWood, though born of Water, **counteracts** Water—**defiance**.\n\nThe Bull King then shifts into a **yellow hawk**—Yellow belongs to Earth,\nWater, though subdued by Wood, **reverses and nourishes** Earth—**defiance**;\nEarth, though subdued by Wood, **reverses and restrains** Water—\nEarth dries, Wood withers.\n\nThus, the **sea-eastern green** cannot subdue the **yellow hawk**,\nbut the **yellow hawk** subdues the **sea-eastern green**—**defiance**.\n\nThe Pilgrim then becomes a **black phoenix**—Black belongs to Water,\nWood, though restrained by Earth, **reverses and nourishes** Water—**defiance**;\nWater, though restrained by Earth, **reverses and counteracts** Earth—\nWater overflows, Earth collapses.\n\nThus, the **yellow hawk** cannot subdue the **black phoenix**,\nbut the **black phoenix** subdues the **yellow hawk**—**defiance**.\n\nThe Old Bull again becomes a **white crane**—White belongs to Metal,\nWood, though subdued by Water, **reverses and nourishes** Metal—**defiance**.\n\nThe Pilgrim transforms into a **crimson phoenix**—Crimson belongs to Fire,\nFire, though subdued by Water, **reverses and nourishes** Fire—**defiance**.\n\nHeavenly Unity’s Water refines the Five Phases (*wǔxíng*) to generate all things,\nnever straying from the five colors—**eastern green, yellow, black, white, crimson**—\nthis is the Dao/Way’s **harmony of following and defiance**, manifesting in transformations above.\n\nThe Old Bull descends from Heaven to Earth,\nlater entering the **Earthly Dao/Way**.\nTransforming into a **fragrant tahr**—Earthly Unity (*Dì’èr*) generates Fire.\nThe tahr shares kinship with the deer,\nsharing the **Mare’s mansion** (*mǎgōng*)—Fire;\nborn from the **white crane’s** Metal, thus Metal **reverses and nourishes** Fire—**defiance**.\n\nThe Pilgrim becomes a **starving tiger**—the tiger’s domain is the West—Metal;\nborn from the **crimson phoenix’s** Fire, thus Fire **reverses and nourishes** Metal—**defiance**;\nBy principle, Metal cannot subdue Fire,\nyet the tiger possesses the power to devour the tahr—\nFire **reverses and is subdued by** Metal—**defiance**.\n\nThe Old Bull again becomes a **golden-money leopard**—the leopard is of Metal,\ntransforming from the tahr—Fire **reverses and becomes** Metal—**defiance**;\nThe Pilgrim then becomes a **golden-eyed lion**—the lion is a Fire beast,\ntransforming from the tiger—Metal **reverses and becomes** Fire—**defiance**;\nThe Old Bull again becomes a **human bear**—the bear belongs to Fire,\nthe leopard transforms into the bear—Metal **reverses and becomes** Fire—**defiance**;\nThe Pilgrim then becomes a **reclining elephant**—the elephant’s power lies in its trunk—Earth,\nthe lion transforms into the elephant—Fire **reverses and becomes** Earth—**harmony**.\n\nThe *Sutra* of **Peeling** (*Bō*) says:\n*\"To follow and then restrain—this is observing the **symbols**.\"*\nEarthly Unity’s Fire refines the Five Phases to generate all things,\nnever straying from the five **symbols**—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth.\nThis is the Dao/Way’s **harmony of defiance and following**, manifesting in transformations below.\n\nHeavenly Unity generates Water,\nEarthly Unity completes it—\nWater and Fire **achieve mutual nourishment** (*Jìjí*),\nall returning to Earth.\nThus, the Bull King retains his original form,\nand the **white cow** appears.\n\nEarth transforms into **white**—\nthen Wood is **balanced**, Water is **harmonized**, Fire is **quenched**, Metal is **clarified**,\nand the **golden elixir** is nearly perfected.\nThus, the Pilgrim assumes his original form,\nand the **ten-thousand-foot golden body** is fully manifest.\n\nThe verse says:\n*\"The clever monkey’s efforts descend the **Dao/Way**.\"*\nSpeaking of cultivation relying entirely on the mind’s concentration and exertion.\n\n*\"The precious fan must be used,\"*\nspeaking of abandoning Metal and Water,\nwhich do not aid Wood and Fire.\n\n*\"The Yellow Mother supports the origin,\"*\n*\"The Wood Mother shares the same sentiment,\"*\nspeaking of Earth and Wood’s application needing diligence.\n\n*\"In harmony, the Five Phases return to their proper unity—**the fruit of righteousness** is achieved.\"*\nSpeaking of the Five Phases converging into one,\nnot harming each other, and thus attaining **Western Paradise** (*Xīfāng*).\n\nHere, the **Great Sage** and the Bull King vie in pursuit,\nwith the **Eight Rules** and Earth Spirit striving at every turn—\nthe **refining** of Metal and Fire,\nrelying solely on Earth and Wood’s application.\n\nTheir divine generals and the **Buddha’s power** in guarding and intercepting,\nas well as the **Li Tianwang** and **Ne Zha**’s decapitation and **mirror-like** projection,\nare none other than the **spirits of Fire, Water, and Earth** shining forth.\n\nTo the North stands **Bìlù** (*毘盧沙門*), the **Sage of Great Omniscience** (*Shéntōng Guǎngdà*), to the South, **Victory** (*Shèngzhì*), the **Sage of Boundless Virtue/Power** (*Fǎlì Wúliàng*);\nTo the East stands **Bìlú** (*毗卢*), the **Sage of Great Strength** (*Dàlì*), to the West stands **Unbreakable Venerable King** (*Bùhuài Zūnwáng*), **Forever Residing** (*Yǒngzhù*).\nFrom all directions, divine soldiers and Heavenly Generals gather,\nwith **Li Tianwang**, bearing the **Tower**, and his son as heavenly guardians above.\n\n*\"The Old Bull returns, transforming into a great white cow,\"*\na **symbol of returning to the origin and the unity of the elements**.\n\nThe **Prince** manifests **three heads and six arms**,\nmounts the Bull’s back in flight,\nand cuts off its head—\n**_Qián_** transforms into **_Kūn_**, symbolizing **_yin_**.\nThe **Bull** loses its head, symbolizing **\"Wǔ\"** (*the hour of the horse*),\nthus piercing forth a head,\nspouting black **_qi_**, generating **_yin_**, ceaselessly—\n**_yin_** fully revealed.\n\nNe Zha then blows **true fire**,\nand **true _yin_** and **true _yang_** mutually nourish each other.\nThe refining complete,\nthe **mind-mirror** (*Xīnjìng*) is used to fix the original **symbol**,\npreventing it from dispersing.\nGreat Strength subdued,\nthe **true treasure** shines forth—\nthis is the **orthodox path of taking refuge in the Buddha-Dharma**.\n\nNe Zha drags the **white cow** back,\nthe **Rakshasa** presents the **true fan**,\nand the **Four Great Heavenly Kings** (*Sìdà Jīnjiāng*) declare:\n*\"Revered Sage, congratulations!\nThe **tenfold merit** is nearly complete!\"*\nThis is the moment when the **golden elixir** is near perfection.\n\nThey further say:\n*\"You must now exert your utmost in cultivation,\nnever slackening for an instant!\"*\nThis indicates that the **refining fire** for the **golden elixir** remains,\nand one must not slacken for a moment.»\n\nThe **true fan** once waved, and the fire subsides;\ntwice waved, and the wind stirs;\nthrice waved, and the rain descends.\nCreation lies within my grasp,\ndemonstrating the natural sequence of **fire cultivation** (*huǒhòu*).\n\nThe verse says:\n*\"Ne Zha leads the white cow back to the Buddha’s realm,\nno longer capricious—\nwater and fire unite, their nature naturally harmonized.\"*\n\nFor when **yin** and **yang** are joined, the cow’s strength is tamed;\nwhen water and fire merge as one, the **Dao** returns to its true essence.\n\nThis is why the **Three Baskets** (*Sāṃzàng*) serve to\n*\"relieve dryness and dispel vexation,\npurify the mind and settle the will.\"*\n\nThe Cow King directly returns to the **Buddha’s Pure Land** (*Fó jìngtǔ*), taking refuge in the **Pure Realm** (*jìngtǔ*);\nThe **Rakshasa** seeks its own **true fan** (*běnxuān*), departing to cultivate in seclusion.\n\nAt the moment of **elixir completion** (*dānchéng*), all furnace, cauldron, and refining implements\nare cast aside.\n\n*\"Continuously waving the fan forty-nine times,\nforever severing the root of fire.\"*\n\nForty-nine is seven times seven—\nforty-nine cycles of **fire cultivation** (*yùnhuǒ*), all now fully revealed.\n\nYet this is not forced or contrived;\nit is the natural unfolding.\n\nThe *Yì* says:\n*\"The great unfolding number is fifty,\nbut its application is forty-nine\"*—\njust so.\n\n*\"Where fire is, rain descends;\nwhere fire is absent, skies clear.\"*\n**Lǐ** below, **Kǎn** above—\n**yin** and **yang** in perfect accord,\nthe image of serene heavens and tranquil earth.\n\nThus the conclusion:\n*\"When **Lǐ** and **Kǎn** are harmonized, the **true essence** unites;\nwater and fire balanced, the **Great Dao** is fulfilled.\"*\n\nThis chapter closely mirrors *Chapter 62: Seizing the Tower to Purify Filth, Binding Demons to Rectify the Self*—\nwhere the **Second Brother** (*Èrláng*) subdues the **Great Sage** (*Dàshèng*), using **yin** to clip **yang** and thus forming *Pǐ*.\nHere, **yin** nourishes **yang**, completing *Jìjí*—\nthus both chapters employ **Li Tianwang** and Ne Zha father and son.\n\nIts profound and wondrous phrasing,\nand the inverted yet brilliant structure,\nare such.\n\nThe *Yì*’s principle of correspondence holds true:\n*\"Jade veiled in stone makes mountains radiant,\npearls cradled in streams make rivers alluring—\nthe **Floating Pagoda** (*fútó*) stores treasures, its light illuminating the four quarters,\nwhile a human body attains the **Dao**, its purity shining through face and back—\none principle alone.\"*\n\nReaders say:\n*\"The **Pleiades** (*Qūyè*) shift their abode,\nbound to the **virtue** of the sovereign;\n**Mars** (*Yínghuò*) alters

praise or censure.\nThe logic of **omens and responses** indeed has its truth.\"*\n\n「The sixty-second chapter—*\"Purifying the Heart by Sweeping the Pagoda\"* and *\"Binding the Demon to Return to the Dao by Cultivating the Body\"*—\n\n**Treasured in Understanding** said: *\"When gold contains jade, the mountain shines; when water cradles pearls, the river enchants. The Floating Pagoda stores treasures, its light illuminating the four quarters, while a human body attains the Dao, its purity shining through face and back—one principle alone.\"*\n\nYet, when the **virtue** (*dé*) of the sovereign wanes, the **Pleiades** (*Qūyè*) shift their abode; when the ruler’s heart is misguided, **Mars** (*Yínghuò*) alters its course. The **Pearl River** (*Pǔzhū*) regards profit and loss as ebb and flow, while **Jing Province’s** fields rise or fall with fortune’s division and union. The waters of **Xīyáng Creek** are clear or turbid as they reflect the governor’s greed or integrity; the **stone mirror of Lin’an** (*Lín’ān shíjìng*) brightens or darkens according to the official’s praise or censure. The logic of **omens and responses** indeed has its truth.\n\nThis **Golden Pagoda** (*Jīnguāngtǎ*), though its treasures depart and its light recedes, is a metaphor for the human body stained by defilement and thus losing its **Dao/Way** (*dào*), where ruler and subject alike falter in their **virtue/power** (*dé*) and their transformations are obstructed—truly a profound and practical meaning. In the previous chapter, the master and disciple achieved balance through water and fire, having already attained the **mystic Dao** (*miàodào*); now, with **dissipation and idle thoughts** (*sǎnchǎn xiāoyáo*) dispelled, the Western Paradise lies in sight.\n\nYet one must **embrace the One and preserve the Primordial** (*bàoyī shǒuyuán*), nurturing it diligently at every moment, so that the heart’s clarity remains untainted. Only then can one await the **fulfillment of merit and the completion of practice** (*hòuzú gōngwán*). If even the slightest negligence or indulgence arises, then **supreme virtue** (*zhìdé*) cannot be cultivated, and the **refined Dao** (*zhìdào*) will not solidify. Hence, the opening verse of *\"Temporary Residence by the River\"* (*Línjiāngxiān*) is inscribed to emphasize this essential truth.\n\nIt says:\n*\"In every twelve-hour span, forget not to tend it,\na hundred moments of practice fully gathered.\nThree years, ten times eight thousand cycles—\ndo not let the **Divine Water** (*Shénshuǐ*) run dry,\nnor let the **Sacred Fire** (*Huǒguāng*) grow weary.\nBalancing water and fire without loss,\nthe **Five Phases** (*Wǔxíng*) linked like a hook.\nHarmony of **Yin and Yang** (*Yīnyáng*) ascending to the **Cloud Palace** (*Yúnlóu*),\nriding the **Luan bird** (*Chéngluán*) to the **Purple Palace** (*Zǐfǔ*),\nand crossing the **Hawk bird** (*Guàhè*) to the **Penglai Isles** (*Yíngzhōu*).\"*\nThe meaning is clear: in a year of **thirty-six thousand moments** (*sānwànliùqiè*), three years yield **one hundred and eight thousand moments** (*shísānwànbāqiānqiè*). Each moment must be nurtured with unwavering devotion—no room for idle indulgence. For the **alchemical practice** (*dàn*) that follows, the **preservation of merit** (*bǎogù*) lies in **washing the heart and purifying the mind** (*xǐxīn dílǜ*), rectifying one’s nature. Otherwise, the nature will remain obscured, and the **alchemical elixir** (*dàn*) will not solidify.\n\nAs the master and disciple arrived in the **Sacrificial Realm** (*Jìsài guó*), they saw a monk bound in shackles, his **blue robes** (*lánlǚ*) in tatters, and inquired whether he was the wronged monk from **Golden Light Temple** (*Jīnguāngsì*). The **Three Treasures** (*Sānguì*)—**no-self** (*wúrén*), **no-other** (*wǒ*), and **no-phenomenon** (*wúzhòngshēng*)—are lost when a monk bears such wrongs. Thus, they sighed: *\"A fox spared from death laments, creatures grieve their kind.\"* This **blood-stained Pagoda** (*xiěguì*) is but the **Three Treasures** (*Sānguì*) defiled by blood; its treasures lost, the **Three Treasures** (*Sānguì*) have themselves lost their essence—thus, it is a single calamity.\n\nTogether, they visited the temple gates to witness it. The **Three Treasures** (*Sānguì*) could not bear the sorrow, and after bowing to the Buddha, they turned away, unable to face the sight, yet still perceiving the **great unity of all beings as the heart’s truth** (*Dàtóng yītǐ wéi xīn*). The monks came to kneel and ask: *\"Your forms are not alike.\"* The monk replied: *\"It seems the celestial deities were disturbed; last night, all received a single dream. Today, they truly saw such strange appearances, hence recognizing them.\"* For though **no-self** (*wúrén*), **no-other** (*wǒ*), and **no-phenomenon** (*wúzhòngshēng*) may differ in name, the **Divine Mind** (*Shénmíng*) silently reveals itself, and through **subtle dreams** (*yōumèng*), all are made known.\n\nWith the monks’ recognition of forms through dreams, the **Three Treasures** (*Sānguì*) subtly imply the **Three Illusions** (*Sānxiàng*)—**no-self** (*wúrén*), **no-other** (*wǒ*), and **no-phenomenon** (*wúzhòngshēng*)—and draw the **Sweeping the Pagoda** (*Sǎotǎ*) lesson close to the **Tang Monk’s** (*Tángsēng*) own body and mind. When the text reaches:\n*\"The king said: ‘Holy monk, your noble bearing is so resplendent—how do your disciples appear thus?’\nThe **Great Sage** (*Dàsèng*) heard and said: ‘Your Majesty must not judge by appearances.’\"*\nonly then does the meaning of **no-self** (*wúrén*), **no-other** (*wǒ*), and **no-phenomenon** (*wúzhòngshēng*) fully reveal itself. The **text’s profound intent** (*Wénxīn yōuzào*) holds **divine subtleties and hidden mysteries** (*shéncáng guǐnì*).\n\n**\"Relics\"** (*Shèlì*) are the Buddha’s physical remains. In ancient times, **Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty** (*Suí Rénshào*) composed the *\"Record of the Relics’ Omens and Responses\"* (*Shèlì Gǎn yìng jì*): When a pagoda was raised in **Thinking Awakening Temple** (*Sījué sì*) in **Qin Province’s** (*Qín Huázhōu*) **Hua State** (*Huá*), the heavens sent a **divine snow** (*yīnxuě*). As the **relics** (*shèlì*) descended, the sun shone brightly, casting a **five-colored radiance** (*wǔsè guāngqì*), several zhang above the earth, resembling a **chariot wheel** (*chēlún*), directly covering the pagoda. From tens of miles away, those gazing saw the **relics** (*shèlì*) as a **pure red glow ascending to heaven** (*zhèngchì shàngshǔ tiān*). Once the **relics** (*shèlì*) had settled, clouds and mists rose again, and the **auspicious snow** (*ruìxuě*) scattered like **heavenly flowers** (*tiān huā*) upon people’s robes, lingering without wetting them. The **Golden Light Pagoda** (*Jīnguāngtǎ*)’s **relics** (*shèlì*) emitting light was an **already attested reality** (*yǐrán shíshì*).\n\nHere, the **Golden Light Pagoda** (*Jīnguāngtǎ*) contains **relics** (*shèlì*), and its **auspicious clouds and rainbow hues** (*xiángruì yá cǎi*) are revered by all, near and far—this is no fabricated tale. The realm’s **literati are unvirtuous** (*wénbùxián*), its **martial prowess is weak** (*wǔbùliáng*), and the ruler lacks the **Dao/Way** (*dào*). This leads to **demonic calamities** (*yāoniè*), **blood-soaked theft** (*yǔxuě dào bǎo*), and the **four quarters’ despair** (*sìfāng shīwàng*). The **Tang Monk** (*Tángsēng*) was summoned, yet the blame was unfairly cast upon the monks. How different is this from one who fails to **cultivate the heart and refine virtue** (*xīnxīn dídé*), yet still **complains of heaven and blames others** (*yuán tiān yóu rén*)?\n\nThey said: *\"The **tyrannical ruler** (*hūn jun*), the **corrupt official** (*zāng guān*), **a thousand tortures and myriad oppressive demands** (*qiān bān kǎodǎ, wàn xiáng zhuīqiú*), **the previous two generations were already beaten to death—now they seize us for punishment.**\"* All spoke of **excessive punishments and heavy taxation** (*fánxíng chóuniàn*), **greed and cruelty** (*tānxīn nǔshēng*), **rooting out even the faintest traces of dissent** (*zhīmàn zhūmǎ*), and **deep-seated corruption** (*jīxí jiùrán*)—the very stains that defile.\n\nThe **Tang Monk** (*Tángsēng*) asked: *\"What hour is it now?\"*\nThey replied: *\"This hour has arrived,\"*\n*\"Give me a fresh broom of **new bamboo** (*xīn dǎo*), so I may bathe and sweep away their sufferings.\"*\n\nThis speaks of **self-purification through renewal** (*zìxīn xīn rén*), layer upon layer. If one resolutely begins anew from this very day, as **Pan Cheng** (*Pán Míng*) swore in his **ritual bath** (*mùyù*), then the **lower cultivation will ascend to the highest** (*xiàxué shàngdá*), and the **defilements of the eyes will be cleansed** (*wūguì mùchú*).\n\nAs the **Disciple** (*Xíngzhě*) swept, he heard voices from the pagoda’s summit. Stepping upon the clouds to look, he saw within the **thirteen-layered Pagoda** (*shísān céng tǎ*), two demons seated at its core—one **warming rice** (*pánfàn*), the other with **a bowl and a pot** (*yīwǎn yīhú*), **drinking and gambling** (*cāiquán chījiǔ*). This describes **seeking the body’s treasures** (*jiǎnshēn huòbǎo*), yet one must **steadfastly trust and resolve with clarity** (*wùdúxīn míngjué*), not indulging in **idle doubts or hesitation**.\n\nIf one does not **choose one path and hold fast** (*bùzé yī gùzhí*), yet **repeatedly wavers in uncertainty** (*fǎnfù chíchí*), **endlessly probing without resolution** (*tàntāo wú dìng*), then within the heart, the two demons sit like guests at the pagoda’s core, **endlessly gambling and drinking** (*yīwèi húcāi*)—nothing but **foolish conjecture** (*húcāi*).\n\nThe **Disciple** (*Xíngzhě*) pressed forward, and the two demons said: *\"This has nothing to do with us! There is one who stole the treasures elsewhere!\"*\nFor **doubt and conjecture** (*cāiyí*) are the true afflictions, arising from **confused understanding** (*zhīshì zhuóluàn*).\n\nThey named **chaotic demons** (*Luànshíshān Bìbōtǎn*), **Sage Kings** (*Wànshèng Lóngwáng*) and **Sage Queens** (*Wànshèng Gōngzhǔ*), the **Nine-Headed Prince** (*Jiǔtóu fùmǎ*), and the **Nine-Leaved Spirit Mushroom** (*Jiǔyè Língzhī*)—all revealing the **Sage’s self-assertion** (*Sèngzì xióng*), **endless deliberations** (*wànlǜ duōsī*), **searching the heavens and the earth** (*jí dì sōutiān*), and **comprehensive scrutiny** (*wúbù zhōudào*). Yet within their own minds, they **flounder in doubt** (*bēnbēn bōbō*), **add to the suffering of the kalpas** (*tiānzǎ jiéjié*), and remain **utterly without certainty** (*quánwú dìngzhǔn*).\n\nThe two lesser demons were named *\"Bēnpōér Bō\"* and *\"Zhēibōér Bēn\"*, mirroring their frenzied, chaotic, and frantic demeanor.\n\n*\"Confessing that Sun Wukong’s divine powers are vast, yet he persistently seeks only the fault of those who stray from the Dao—*\"*\nFor Wukong’s steadfastness in this very matter, he could discern the faults of those who were not steadfast, embodying the principle of **\"using one to overcome myriad\"** (*dé yī yǐ yù wàn*).\n\n*\"The Pilgrim said, ‘This fiend specializes in malevolent deeds,’\"*—rightly perceiving the fault of those who lack steadfastness—\n*\"‘Locking the demon at the temple,’\"*—rightly seeking the fault of those who stray from the Dao.\n\n*\"When the Tripitaka Master bowed before the king, and the monks petitioned on behalf of the wronged, explaining the circumstances of the tower’s cleansing and the capture of the thief, the king was startled by the differing appearances of the master and his disciples,\"*—\nfor the king saw only the distinctions between **humans** (*rén*), **demons** (*shén*), and **all beings** (*zhòngshēng*), unable to seize the thief.\n\nThe Great Sage declared:\n*\"‘One cannot judge by outward form—if one loves the appearance of wealth and splendor, how could one ever capture a demonic thief?’\"*\nHis words spoke of purifying the mind and heart, of **unimpeded great impartiality** (*kuòrán dàgōng*), **neither within nor without**, **unattached to forms**.\n\nOnce one clings to forms, then one is bound to assess based on outward appearance, while **private desires** (*sīyù*) flood the mind and **demonic thieves** (*yāozéi*) run rampant—how could one ever hope to seize them?\nThis duty, then, falls beyond the capacity of the Great Sage **without form** (*wúxiàng*)—who else could be fit for the task?\n\nThe Pilgrim’s grand palanquin and yellow parasol, borne by eight attendants, were **simply arranged** (*suǒ yóu tè jiǎn*) for ease of travel.\n\nThe Foolish One laughed and said:\n*\"‘Brother, you’ve won this round for yourself.’\"*\n\n「Indeed, this kind of duty and merit is bestowed upon me by my own nature, yet not wielded by the Lord **Zhūnyán**—this is what is called *heavenly virtue* (*tiānjué*), not *human virtue* (*rényuè*).\n\nThe two demons confessed:\n*\"‘There is a **Universal Sage Dragon King** (*Wànshèng Lóngwáng*), whose daughter is exceedingly charming,’\"*—speaking of **inner chaos** (*nèi*) and **outer confusion** (*shì*), **reckless calculation** (*fēnsù*), **concealing emotions** (*yǐnqíng*) while **favoring partiality** (*piānzhǔ*) and **self-aggrandizement** (*zìdà*).\n*\"‘The **Nine-Headed Son-in-Law** (*Jiǔtóu Fùmǎ*) was summoned as a **divine match** (*zhāozhuì*), with **unrivaled divine powers** (*shéntōng wúdì*),’\"*—speaking of **external distractions** (*wài*) and **turbulent thoughts** (*rǎosī*), **clinging to desires** (*fùyì jiǔchán*) while **boasting in excess** (*zìduō*).\n\n*\"‘The Dragon King and the Son-in-Law meet as companions,’\"*—**heart-intent** (*xīnyì*) and **material cravings** (*wùyù*) **intermingle** (*jiāochéng*), **\"first unleashing blood rain\"** (*xiān xià xuèyǔ*), **soiling oneself to soil others** (*zìwū yǐ wū rén*).\n*\"‘Then stealing the **Sacred Relics** (*shè lì*),’\"**—**obstructing others for self-gain** (*fáng rén yǐ lì jī*).\n\n*\"‘Now he illuminates the Dragon Palace, making the night as bright as day,’\"**—**vaunting in private wisdom** (*zìqīn sīzhì*), claiming he can **pierce the dark** (*zhé yōu*).\n*\"‘He also steals the **Queen Mother’s Lingzhi** (*Wángmǔ língzhī*), nurturing treasures in the pond,’\"**—**coveting celestial merit** (*tān tiān gōng*), **hoping in vain to become a Buddha** (*ān xī zuò fó*).\n\nThis kind of **cultivation of the self** (*xiūshēn*) is **frantic and exhausting** (*cùyòng bēnpó*), **in vain wasting the eons** (*wǎng láo bājié*). Hence, the guiding principle is stated: *\"‘Binding demons and returning to the true path is cultivation of the self’\"* (*fǔ mó guī zhèng nǎi xiūshēn*), meaning **true cultivation must be grounded in concrete action** (*qìshí xiàshǒu*), not mere words.\n\nTo **seize the thief and capture the king** (*qín zéi qín wáng*), who but the Great Sage could **restore order** (*guī*)? The **Eight Precepts** (*Bājiè*) declared: *\"‘I’ll assist Brother in seizing them with ease.’\"* This is indeed **true resolve to act** (*nǎi zhēn néng xiàshǒu*).\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Three: Two Monks Dispel Demons, the Dragon Palace in Chaos, the Holy Ones Subdue Evil, and Gain Treasures**\n\nThe **Awakened One** (*Wùyī Zǐ*) said: **Dao/Way** is not **empty enlightenment** (*xūwù*), **cultivation is true merit** (*xiū shì shígōng*). **Action must be decisive** (*xiàshǒu yào zhuó*), **first restraining the eyes** (*xiān wéi zhì yǎn*).\n\nThe *Yīnfǔ Jīng* states: *\"‘The mechanism lies in the eyes’\"* (*qí jī zài mù*).\nThe *Zhèngdào Bǎizì Jué* proclaims: *\"‘The Eternal must dwell in the eyes; in the eyes, the *qi* follows the essence’\"* (*zhēn cháng xū zài mù, zài mù qì suí jīng*).\nThe *Yì* speaks of *\"‘looking upward and downward’\"* (*yǎng guān fǔ chá*).\nThe **Ancient Sage** (*Lǎo*) says: *\"‘Observe the boundless, observe the marvelous’\"* (*guān jiāo guān miào*).\nThe **Buddha** teaches *\"‘still observation and quiescent observation’\"* (*jìng guān zhǐ guān*), while the **Four Sages** (*Sìshèng*) emphasize *\"‘Four Abstentions’\"* (*sì wù*), with **vision** (*shì*) as their priority.\nThe **Crumpled Sage** (*Bāxiān*) writes of *\"‘Three Essentials’\"* (*sān yào*), with the **eyes** (*mù*) as their pivot.\n\nEven the saying *\"‘The Dao/Way is right before you, yet you fail to see its command’\"* (*dào zài qiánmiàn, gù zé míng mìng*)—from ancient sages, immortals, **Buddhas and Patriarchs** (*fó zǔ*), **scriptures and classics** (*jīng zhuàn*), **poetry and prose** (*shī cí*)—all affirm the **eyes** (*mù*) as the **critical mechanism** (*yào jī*).\n\nAlas, how **mortals squander heaven’s gift** (*shì rén gūfù tiānfù*), **emptily possessing two eyes** (*kòng jù liǎng yǎn*), yet **they become obstructions** (*zuò zhàng*), **clouding vision** (*zuò yì*), **willing to glance or peer** (*gān piē gān kuī*), **yet unable to gaze deeply or discern clearly** (*mò néng dòngzhǔ shú dǔ*)!\n\nThis is what **the Sacrificial Kingdom** (*Jìsài Guó*) called *\"‘the fleshly eyes of a common mortal’\"* (*ròuyǎn fān tāi*), yet who knows that **immortals, ancient Buddhas, and Bodhisattvas** (*púsà*) **are present in the very gaze** (*xiànzài qiánmiàn*)?\n\nThe Great Sage’s **Flame Eyes and Golden Pupils** (*Huǒyǎn Jīnqīng*)—why rely on these two demons to **open his vision** (*zuò yǎn*)? *\"‘Take these two small demons and bind them as eyes’\"* (*bǎ liǎng gè xiǎo yāo dài qù zuò yǎn*)—this **clearly demonstrates the first step in cultivation is to restrain the eyes** (*zhèng míng xiānshǒu xiàshǒu gōngfū, zài zhì liǎng yǎn yě*).\n\nThe Great Sage could **pluck a hair to forge a blade** (*mó máo kě biàn dāo*), yet why **uniquely transform his Golden Hoop Staff into a Precept Knife** (*jīngú bàng biàn yī jiè dāo*)? *\"‘With one slice, sever the demon’s ear; with another, sever the demon’s lips. Cast them into the water and say, *‘I am the Heavenly Equal Great Sage here!*’*\"* (*yī gē yāo ěr, yī gē yāo chún, piē zài shuǐ lǐ, shuō wǒ qí tiān dà shèng zài cǐ yě*)—this **shows the resolve to act with fixed principle as a Precept** (*shì yòng dòng wù zhí yīdìng zhī lǐ wéi jiè*), ensuring the **ears do not listen to demonic sounds** (*ěr wù zuò yāo tīng*), the **mouth does not speak demonic lies** (*kǒu wù zhāng yāo yán*), and the **two eyes, plunged into the verdant waves, remain unobstructed** (*liǎng yǎn rù yú bì bō ér wú bì*).\n\n**Precepts for movement, for ears, for mouth** (*jiè dòng, jiè ěr, jiè kǒu*)—all are **Precepts for the eyes** (*zǒng shì jiè mù*). Only when the **eyes are truly restrained** (*zhì mù*), does the **Heavenly Equal Great Sage** (*zhēn yī shàngxiān zhī qí tiān dà shèng*) **manifest here** (*xiànzài cǐ yě*).\n\nThe two demons reported: *\"‘Disaster is upon us!’\"* (*shuō huòshì liǎo*), a **warning of restraint** (*gào jiè yě*).\nThe Son-in-Law laughed: *\"‘Mount Tai is at ease!’\"* (*shuō Tàiyuè fàngxīn*), **yet he does not know of restraint** (*bù zhī jiè yě*).\n\nHe brandished a **Moon-Crescent Claw** (*yuèyá chǎn*), crying: *\"‘What Heavenly Equal Great Sage? I stole treasures—what concern of yours? Yet without cause, you injured my head, and now you disturb my sacred mountain!’\"* (*shì shén yī bǐng yuèyá chǎn, jiào shì shén qí tiān dà shèng, wǒ tōu bǎobèi, yǔ nǐ hé gān? què wú gù shāng wǒ tóumù, yòu shàng wǒ bǎoshān sī nào!* )\n\nThe **\"Bright\"** is the power of the sun and moon. The clarity of the eyes is like that of the sun and moon. Now, the Son-in-Law wields the Moon-Crescent Claw—this is the **partial light of the hooked moon**, unable to discern the Heavenly Equal Great Sage, yet he **plunders treasures and misperceives the sacred mountain**, wrongly taking the **restraint of the eyes** as an injury to his own.\n\nThe Wayfarer spoke: *\"This fiend is utterly devoid of reason! Though I do not accept the king’s favor, you stole his treasures—monks are my kin by shared qi. How could I not aid in clarifying the truth for them?\"* For **establishing virtue** does not arise from gratitude, and **acting in power** is not solely for oneself—**without self, others, or living beings**, this is true clarity.\n\n*\"The Great Sage struck first with a rod, and Eight Rules followed with a spade. That monster has nine heads—all eyes.\"* Yet he cannot **discern the past to know restraint**, nor **look ahead to understand warning**; though his eyes are many, what good are they?\n\n*\"Its true form was revealed—utterly ferocious.\"* Eight Rules asked: *\"What blood and qi have spawned this beast?\"* The Dao states: *\"Birds are beasts.\"* Though birds have two wings and beasts four legs, how can they be said to be the same? *The Rites* say: *\"The gibbon can speak, yet it is not separate from birds and beasts.\"* Thus, beasts include those that speak. This nine-headed creature—what beast is it? Birds that speak, beasts that speak—this describes something **far beyond human kind**, beyond what a single bird or beast could name.\n\n*\"The monster spread its wings and flew askew, then from its midsection stretched another head, biting off Eight Rules.\"* It mimics **glimpsing obliquely, listening wildly, and biting madly**—completely contrary to the **\"Four Avoidances\"**, yet unaware of restraint, arrogantly claiming might.\n\n*\"The Wayfarer transformed into a crab, biting through the rope to rescue Eight Rules; then using a hidden-body technique, he stole the spade and passed it to Eight Rules.\"* The crab—**dissolving, scattering difficulty**. Hidden—**concealing, the aperture of revelation**. This is **liberation from entanglement**, guiding the nature of restraint to **stealthy action**.\n\n*\"Eight Rules charged into the palace, smashing gates and vessels, startling the old and young.\"* This is the **vigorous effort to eliminate the old and birth the new**. *\"The Wayfarer suddenly saw the pursuit of Eight Rules and, midair, trod upon clouds and mist, striking the old dragon’s head to smithereens.\"* This is **clear-eyed and swift-handed**, seizing the thief’s heart with the **unmatched method of one overcoming ten thousand**. Xue Wenqing said: *\"Private desires have long disturbed my heart—now I must decisively sever them all to preserve my serene, pure essence.\"* Here, one strike slays the old dragon of myriad saints, and the **Emerald Pool is no longer muddied by chaotic stones**.\n\nYet the old dragon of myriad saints acted without wisdom, **drowned in greed**. Though it possessed countless principles yet failed to discern right from wrong, though named \"myriad saints,\" it was truly **a thief many times over**. To kill the thief’s heart—**easy to destroy**. But the nine-headed demon, seeing much yet acting as a thief, **relying on its cunning**—though called \"nine-headed,\" it is truly **ten evils**. With many thieves, its evil is hard to eradicate. Thus, **a great heavenly decree must be issued**, like the **autumn’s stern killing of all things**, to punish and renew.\n\n*\"The Wayfarer suddenly heard howling winds and grim mists—closer inspection revealed the Second Prince manifesting with the Seven Sacred Brothers.\"* Two—**a pair**; seven—**the number of minor yin**, the time of autumn. *The Daoist Canon Song* says: *\"The White Emperor moves qi, the Dao is renewed.\"* This is the **great hour for eliminating evil**, a **mighty strategy**, hence: *\"This is a grand opportunity.\"*\n\nAutumn’s qi kills, yet **Heaven’s benevolent heart operates within it—life within death**. Grass and trees wither and dissolve, yet all treasures mature. This is **Heaven’s punishment**, exterminating the stubborn, purifying the people’s resolve, as the virtuous uphold righteousness, **cutting off desires and cultivating virtue**—all paths to **cleansing and renewal**. The Dao values **self-knowledge and repentance**, only then gaining salvation. The Great Sage, having *\"once been subdued and disliking confrontation,\"* knew repentance.\n\n*\"Eight Rules requested the True Lord to halt, and with the Great Sage, they reminiscenced in the Second Prince’s camp through the night, awaiting dawn to battle.\"* This holds the meaning of **Ji Gong’s triple kindness and quadruple virtue**, waiting until morning.\n\nWhy did Eight Rules slaughter the dragon’s offspring, why did the hound bite off one of the nine-headed beast’s heads, yet the monster escape unharmed? Because **the wicked seed was fully uprooted**, the **den of the great rebel pacified**; killing one to **warn a hundred**, leaving open the door for self-renewal. The leader’s head must be struck—**to set an example**; some thieves may be pardoned—**to show utmost mercy**. *\"Even now, a nine-headed remnant drips blood,\"*—**executing fully to satisfy the moment is not as effective as prolonged punishment to warn the ages**. The hound’s growl from its jaws **declares judgment to clear the guilty**.\n\nStele, the ninth month’s hexagram, **hides treasure in the fire storehouse**. The scholar must **sever desires and cultivate sincerity**, **severely reproach oneself**, establishing **virtue, deeds, and words**, preserving the **few and rare** to differ from beasts—**thus**.\n\n*\"The Wayfarer transformed into the Son-in-Law’s form, reclaiming the two treasure chests,\"*—**turning evil into truth, gaining two from one**. *\"Eight Rules pounced on the princess, producing the dragon widow, and left her in the tower,\"*—**restraining the demon’s allure while revealing its maternal heart, abandoning abandonment to preserve benevolence**. *\"The king uncovered the indestructible relics and obtained the heavenly life-granting grass,\"*—**resolving grievances, cherishing virtue, illuminating the obscure and clarifying the mysterious**.\n\n「**Tripitaka** placed the Buddha’s treasure atop the tower, enshrined the **Dragon Widow** within its heart, and the **Wayfarer** declared: *\"With the life-granting grass, I swept the thirteen-layered tower layer by layer, placed it in the bottle, and nurtured the indestructible relics—thus, restoring the old as if it were new.\"* This is **self-discipline and earnest practice**, each step firmly grounded in reality, each step a treasure from Heaven—how could it compare to those who speak of **emptiness and truth** in vain, pontificating on the tower’s forms without substance?\n\nThe realm is called **\"Sacrifice and Strife\"** (*jìsài*), revealing treasure yet lacking **virtue’s** cultivation; the temple is named **\"Golden Radiance\"** (*jīnguāng*), flashing brilliance yet failing to embody **tranquility**. Now, the **\"Sacrifice and Strife\"** realm’s **\"Golden Radiance\"** temple is renamed **\"Subdued Dragon\"** (*fùlóng*), where **mystery and insight** dwell in quietude, its light returning and reflecting—this is truly **great and enduring**.\n\nAs for the **ten thousand sages** and **nine-headed demons** who flaunt their private interpretations, engaging in **stealthy plunder** and **self-aggrandizement**, bestowing **sainthood** and **wisdom** upon themselves—what **benefit** do they truly bring?\n\nThus, the conclusion is drawn:\n*\"The demonic thorns extinguish the Heavenly’s joy,\nThe golden tower’s light shines upon the Earth—**truly**.\"*\n\n**The Sixty-Fourth Chapter**:\n*\"Upright at the Thorny Ridge, **Taoist** Treats with Earnest Effort—\nIn the **Wood Immortal’s** Hermitage, the **Tripitaka** Discusses Poetry.\"*\n\n**Taoist** said:\n\"The **Dao** is vast and unobstructed, the world’s path smooth and open—**originally**, there are no thorns. Thorns arise from within the human breast.\"\n\nIn every breast, thorns abound;\nIn every heart, thorns are found—\nYet thorns stretch across Heaven and Earth—\nWhy single out **Thorny Ridge** alone?\n\nThis passage **specifically** borrows **Thorny Ridge** to encompass all ages, past and present—**thus it is**. It borrows the **Wood Immortal’s** Hermitage discussion of poetry to encompass **all** who speak of the **Way**, from ancient times to now—**all** are thorns, **none** escape like this **poetic discourse**.\n\nThe *Nanhua* (*Zhuangzi*) says:\n*\"Lost in the radiant, lost in the radiant—it does not harm my path;\nRetreating from the crooked, retreating from the crooked—it does not harm my feet.\"*\n**This is the pain of thorns** filling the way ahead.\n\nI **do not avoid** the **thorny** reputation—\nI **borrow** the **Heavenly Pound’s** strength (*Tiān Pēng*)—\nAnd **unify** the discourse: **All** grand writings and splendid phrases, adorned with **eloquence** and **rich imagery**, profound yet stirring, **exquisitely refined** and **unparalleled**—\nSome **deliberately** craft obscurity to boast of **depth** and **mystery**;\nSome **recklessly** speak against taboos to display **talent** and **emotion**;\nSome **eloquently** argue with **endless twists**, rolling forth ceaselessly to **enrich debate**.\n\nYet **truly**, those who **do not connect** their words to **self-cultivation, heart, nature, and life’s essence**—**all** are thorns!\nNot only this—**all** who write books and speak of **mystery**, **emptiness**, yet **cannot embody the Way** with **personal practice**, merely **wielding pens** and **playing with words**, repeating **heard teachings** and **rumored sayings**—though they **utter all** the **marvels of the Way**, worthy of **emulation** and **transmission**, it is but **parroted cleverness**, **mocking reverence**, all like the **Wood Immortal’s** poetic discourse—**the most severe thorns**!\n\nHeaven **born** the **three teachings’** sages, each **guiding the world** with **divided heads**—\nYet their **origins** all stem from the **Dao of the Yellow River, Luo River, the Supreme Ultimate, and Yin-Yang’s creative transformation**.\nLater generations, **Daoist, Buddhist, and Chan schools**, split into **sects and factions**, **endless schemes** emerging—\nThey **compete** in **discourse**, **flaunting interpretations**, **mutually slandering**—**all** are thorns **within thorns**!\n\nThe **Confucian teaching** upholds **central harmony and singularity**, **unimpeded fairness**—\n*\"Citizens as one’s kin, all things as one’s companion\"*—\n**This is the most fitting and unchanging principle**,\n**No different** from **preserving the Middle, attaining steadfast wisdom**—\n**Desireless yet with desire, selfless yet with self**—\nHow **diverse** is this from **Mencius’** *\"Cultivating the Qi\"*?\n\nYet **Confucius** praised **the Yellow Dragon** (*Yóu Lóng*), saying:\n*\"In the West, a sage will arise!\"*\nLater generations **clung** to **textual details**, unable to **embody and practice**—\nThey **must reject** *\"mysterious\"* words,\n**Betraying** the **Dao of the Yellow Emperor’s** *\"mystery\"* yet **unaware**;\nThey **must denounce** the *\"emptiness\"* character,\n**Betraying** **Confucius’** *\"emptiness\"* yet **oblivious**;\nThey **must doubt** *\"True Yin\"* (*Zhēnyī*) **Qi**,\n**Ignoring** **Mencius’** *\"nurturing Qi\"* yet **unrecognizing**;\nThey **must oppose** *\"True Emptiness\"* (*Zhēnkōng*),\n**Excluding** **Zi Si’s** *\"self-sincerity\"* yet **remaining silent**.\n\n**To debate principles**, why **quibble over words**?\nThey **must deliberately** reject and **denigrate**,\nClaiming **defense of the Sage’s Way**,\nYet **what of** *\"unimpeded fairness\"*?\nIs this not **severing thorns** while **thorns** **pierce** the breast **most severely**?\n\nAccording to the *Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon* (*Huángdì Nèi Zhuàn*):\nThe **Daoist teaching** began with **Emperor of Primordial Beginnings** (*Yuānshǐ Tiānwáng*),\n**Opening** the **chaotic void**, **establishing** the **three powers** (*sān cái*),\n**Transforming** to **generate** the **ten thousand things**—\nTill the **Zhou Dynasty**, when **Laozi** transmitted the *Dao De Jing* (*Moral Teachings*) in **five thousand words**.\n\nAccording to the *Book of Zhou* (*Zhōushū*):\nThe **Confucian teaching** began with the **Yellow Emperor**,\nWho **commanded** **Cangxu** to **create script**, beginning **writing and contracts**—\nTill the **twenty-eighth year of King Jing of Zhou**, when **Confucius** was born,\nAnd **proclaimed** its **teachings**.\n\nAccording to **Emperor Wu of Liang’s** *Buddhist Lineage* (*Fó Tǒng*):\nThe **Buddha** was born in **Eastern India**,\nAt the time of **King Zhuang of Zhou’s** ninth year,\nOn the **eighth day of the fourth month**—\nFrom **Emperor Ming of Han’s** *Yongping* eighth year,\nThe **Dharma** began to **enter China** and **prosper**.\n\nIt has been **investigated** that the people of **Eastern India** are **naturally robust**, fond of **battle and slaughter**,\nConsidering **death in war** as **auspicious**, **peaceful passing** as **inauspicious**.\n**Laozi**, upon leaving **Hangu Pass**,\n**Transformed** the **Floating Image** (*Fútú*) **method**,\nOrdering **internal and external purification**, **no harm to the body**,\nAnd naming it **\"Floating Image\"** (*Fútú*).\n\nIn the **ninth year of King Zhuang of Zhou**, on the **eighth day of the fourth month**,\nThe **fixed stars** vanished, **falling like rain**—\nThat night, **Shakyamuni Buddha** was born,\nCapable of **practicing** **Bo Yang’s** **Dao** (*i.e., Laozi’s teachings*),\nAnd the people **followed** him, calling him **\"Buddha\"** (*Fó*).\n\n**Buddha** is what China calls **\"God\"** (*Shén*),\nThe next rank is **\"Bodhisattva\"** (*Púsà*).\nHis realm **teemed with life**, **no widows, orphans, or lonely souls**—\nThus, people **wished to be reborn** there.\n\nThen **Buddhist teaching** **originated from China**, spreading **westward**,\nAnd **returned westward** to **re-enter China**—\n**This is not a foreign teaching**!\n\n**Laozi** **was truly the Buddha’s ancestor**,\nThe **Buddha truly performed Laozi’s teachings**—\n**God is Buddha, Buddha is God**—\nOnly **different in pronunciation** between **East and West**!\n\n**Confucianism** **originated from the Yellow Emperor’s** **script**,\n**Revealing** the **marvelous Dao** of **three powers’** transformation and **generation**—\nThe **Yellow Emperor** was truly the **Confucian ancestor**,\n**Confucius** merely **proclaimed** its **teachings**—\nYet **how** did later generations **consider Yellow Lao** as **contrary to Confucianism**?\n\nThe root of all confusion lies in ignorance of the **three teachings’** origins—\nAnd those who bear **thorns in their breast** are the most extreme!\n\nThe **Buddha** is **God**; **immortals** are **God**.\n**Perfect sincerity**—**ineffable and divine**—is what we call **God**.\nThough all are called **God**, yet to claim **Confucianism** differs from the **two schools**,\nIs this not to **plant thorns** within oneself?\n\nThe **Celestial Emperor** loved the **people** He created and transformed,\nAnd specially begot the **sacred Son of Heaven** to govern and nurture them;\nHe specially begot the **three teachings’ great sages** to reveal the **principles of creation**,\nTo exhaust the **methods of teaching and transformation**,\nAnd to refine the **qi and fate** of countless ages.\nBorn in the same era, yet guiding along separate paths—\nThe **Celestial Emperor** truly **oversaw them all**.\n\nI have heard that **Zhuangzi** followed the **open lineage of the revealed tradition**,\nThat **Yashodhara**, wife of **Shakyamuni**, and **Rahula**, his son,\nWhen ascending, wept and lamented bitterly—\nHow could this compare to today’s **widows and lonely souls**?\n\nLater generations despised the **corruptions** of the **two schools**,\nYet failed to despise the **corruptions of Confucianism** as well.\nClinging rigidly, they scrutinized **single phrases or characters**,\nAnd **slandered the sages**, defying **Heaven**—\nTheir own breasts bristled with **thorns**, yet they sought to **prune the world’s thorns**?\n\nNow’s **Confucian scholar**, collecting **fleeting arts**,\nAspiring to **official rank and wealth**,\nTheir **initial thoughts and motives** are but **merchants’ schemes for profit and gain**—\nThey know not what **nature and life** are,\nNor what **benevolent governance** entails.\nTheir **knowledge and abilities** diverge utterly from the **scriptures’ teachings**—\nThe **heterodoxies of Confucianism** surpass those of the **two schools**,\nYet they fail to **prune the thorns**—\nI do not know where this path will end.\n\nThus, I must speak of **thorns**,\nTo aid **Tianpeng** like a **myriad-legged insect** in battle.\n\nIf this book speaks of **demons and marvels**,\nMen will see it as **thorns sprouting at every step of the Dao**—\nYet I see it as **orchids and osmanthus planted at every stride**.\nThe **discerning** will gather them.\n\nAt the **beginning**, the monks of **Fulong Temple** knew neither **advance nor retreat**,\nAnd presumptuously hoped to join—\nThey do not grasp the **abundance of thorns** along the Dao.\n\nThe **traveler**, when the **tiger transforms**, must **halt and dwell**—\nThere is a **\"Great Man’s tiger-transformation\"**,\nUnrecognized by the common crowd.\n\nAt **Jingjie Ridge**, one cannot proceed further—\nAs the poem says:\n*\"Everywhere brambles twine around ancient trees,\nLayer upon layer, vines coil about the thick branches.\nWho among men does not encounter thorns?\nYet who has seen the **Western Lands’ thorns** so vast?\"*\nThis clearly states that the **West** too is thick with **thorns**—\nIt refers to **empty talk of poetry and prose**, like those at **Muxian An**.\n\nThe **Eight Precepts** say:\n*\"If you wish to cross, depend on me.\"*\nThe blame lies in one’s **own power to prune the thorns**.\n\nThe body stretches twenty *zhang* long,\nThe handle thirty *zhang*—\nBoth hands wield the hoe,\nLeft and right, clearing the way.\n\nFor the body holds the **Two Principles**,\nThe hands grasp the **Three Powers**,\nUniting the **Five Phases** to illuminate the **Precepts’ essence**—\nStriving to prune the thorns with resolve.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"From now on, the Eight Precepts break through,\nPiercing the Western Path—smooth and clear.\"*\n\nAt an open stretch, suddenly met\nBy the **Eighteen Elders’** friends discussing poetry.\n**Naive Master**, **Lofty Scholar**, and **Wisp-Clearing Hermit**\nRecite verses all revealing their true nature—\nTheir meaning is self-evident.\n\nOnly they say:\n*\"We are not the ‘Four Sage Ministers,’\nBut the ‘Four Operatives’ of the deep mountains.\"*\nTo show that those who claim to cultivate the Dao\nYet flee the world’s clamor,\nFeigning seclusion and lofty detachment,\nSpeaking grandly of **nature and life**\nWhile utterly lacking substance—\nAll are **Confucian scholars’ Cao Cao**.\n\nAll deceitful pretenders\nMust seek to associate with sincere gentlemen\nTo lend their names credibility,\nThus they contrive to ensnare **Tripitaka**\nAnd engage him in **Chan** and Dao discourse.\n\n**Tripitaka** responds with common teachings,\nBut when he says:\n*\"I’ve questioned **True Essence** at **Yuan Shi’s** anvil,\nRealized **Muni’s** methods,\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"Who at the **Mystic Pass** can cross?\nI’ve long cultivated **Great Awakening Chan**—\nOnly those with **root and resolve** may awaken,\"*\nThis is the **Dao’s true truth**,\nNot empty **Chan**—**Buddha is Immortal**.\n\nThe **Four Elders** say:\n*\"The **Venerable Monk** grasps the **Chan’s root essence,\"*\nA fitting observation.\n\n**Wisp-Clearing Hermit** declares:\n*\"Though **Chan** is still, though **Law** is passed,\nOne must settle the **nature**, purify the **heart**—\nAll for the **Great Awakening’s true Immortal**,\nUltimately attaining the **Path of No-Birth.\"*\nThis strikes the mark.\n\nWhen they say:\n*\"Our **Mystic** is far different,\"*\nThey mean **nature’s original essence**—\nUnbroken, unharmed,\nNeeding no cultivation,\nReturning to verify the Dao.\n\nThis is **substance without cultivation**,\n**Knowledge without practice**—\nExternally boasting of lofty talk,\nInternally lacking true benefit—\nThus they are **\"Operatives.\"**\n\nWhen they say:\n*\"We were born firm and solid,\"*\nSuch words merely describe their **nature**,\nWith no profound meaning.\n\nAs for:\n*\"The Dao originates in China,\nYet they seek verification in the West—\nWasting grass-sandals for nothing,\nUnclear what they’re searching for.\nStone lions’ hearts carved out,\nFox spirits’ saliva seeping to the bone.\nForgotten roots, they meditate in vain,\nChasing **Buddha’s fruit**—\nAll riddles of **Jingjie Ridge’s brambles**,\nEmpty **Luo-luo** jokes.\"*\n\nThey also say:\n*\"One must examine the face before them,\nWithin stillness, life unfolds.\nBottomless bamboo basket drawing water,\nRootless iron tree blooming.\nChained to **Lingbao Peak’s** foot,\nReturning to the **Yahui Assembly** on dragon-clouds.\"*\nEach word shatters the **Chan’s empty void**,\nDrawing out the **mystic essence**.\n\nThe core of *Journey to the West* lies here—\n**Jingjie Ridge’s** entire framework!\n\n**Lofty Scholar** says:\n*\"Wisp-Clearing’s words reveal too much.\nThe **Venerable Monk** need not cling.\"*\n\nThis is how the **Master** uses their mouths\nTo reveal the **true Dao’s profound truth**.\n\nOnce the **true meaning** is reached,\nOne must know **false learning**.\n\nThe **Four Operatives** gather for **Moonlit Wandering**,\nNot for **lectures on cultivation**;\nThe **Four Elders** dwell with **wood and stone**,\nOnly becoming **naked ghostly messengers**.\n\nPolishing verses, crafting odd phrases,\nBoasting of **literary skill**;\nTaking pride in **reclusion’s leisure**,\nDrifting in forests and valleys—**self-abandoned**.\n\nFormless, useless,\nArrogant yet ordinary,\nPure in speech, corrupt in deed,\nUnaware of death—\nHow pitiful!\n\nSome mistakenly claim **True Cultivation**,\nHoarding **A-Jiao** to refine **yin essence**;\nJealous of the upright, they unleash **Red Lotus**,\nBreaking **Precepts**—\nThis is how **Moon-Playing Poet** and **Peach Immortal** originate,\nExposing their deceit.\n\n**Tripitaka** says:\n*\"You are all monstrous creatures,\"*\nAll **Operatives**.\n\nAt first, they discussed **Dao** with **elegance**,\nNow they lure with **beautiful women**—\nClearly exposed, no need for further explanation.\n\nAt dawn, the demons scatter in alarm,\nThe **Master and disciples** trace the roots—\nThey are **cypress, cedar, pine, and bamboo** turned monstrous,\nClearly the **Dao’s and Buddha’s thorns’ essence**,\nYet they feign **scholarly pretension**.\n\n**Eight Rules** strives mightily,\nCrushing them all—\nHow splendidly clear!\n\nStudents, beware—\nDo not abandon **life-and-death’s true practice**\nFor empty **moral discourse**,\nNor compose **useless poetry**,\nContent to be the **Four Operatives** of **Muxian An**.\n\n**Lu Xiangshan** said:\n*\"Tell my fellow travelers—\nDo not let words corrupt **Heaven’s order.\"*\n**Zou Nan Gao** also said:\n*\"Tell the young at the window—\nDo not waste your youth on **commentary and prose.\"*\nOne meaning.\n\n**Chapter 65**\n*The Demon’s Feigned Small Pure Land*\n*The Four Disciples All Suffer Great Calamity*\n\n「The **Master** said:\n*\"In the previous section, the demon assumed a lofty, boastful guise, relying on innate talent, yet neglecting **cultivation and practice**—only fostering idle **lectures and debates**, composing hollow **poetry and prose**, dwelling in secluded, leisurely places to appear as a **strange figure**. Here, the demon feigns the **Buddha’s** name, seizing **dharma and reason** to deceive, adorns its outward form with cunning artifice, and entices many of the **good** into confusion—none can distinguish it, though it appears **authentic**. The former harms itself and others in a minor way; this one harms others to the point of **destroying life and extinguishing nature**, even using **scholarship** to slaughter the **future generations of the world**—thus, it is the **great calamity**!\n\n*\"The **Tripitaka Master** has escaped the **thorny entanglements** of the **Ugly Peak**, now gazing upon lofty mountains that touch the **Heavenly realm**. Descending the pass to the west, he suddenly beholds a radiant **auspicious aura**, with swirling **colorful mists**, and **palaces and pavilions** faintly glimpsed through the **temple bells**. The **pilgrim** examines it closely—within the **auspicious signs**, there are also ominous **qi** and **portents**. Though it is **Léiyīn Temple**, the **path and way** are clearly **erroneous and misguided**.\n\n*\"The **Dao’s** true or false nature each bears its own **qi and portents**. The **true** flourishes from the **root of the heart**, while the **false** is mere outward adornment. The **qi** of the **rooted heart** is like flowers growing naturally from a tree—spirit vibrant, arising from **authentic virtue**. The **qi** of **adorned appearance** is like **clipped paper flowers**—colors dull and lifeless, born from **artifice and contrivance**. The distinction is clear: those with **clear insight** can discern it at once. Hence, the **pilgrim** observes carefully and knows this **path is flawed**.\n\n*\"Léiyīn Temple,\" though called such, is marked as **‘small’**—a **clear indication** of the **petty**. The **Tripitaka Master** cannot see its **smallness**, nor its **falsehood**, so he mistakes it for the **Buddha’s** pure **dharma-ground**, leading his **disciples** to bow in reverence. The **pilgrim**, however, sees its **smallness** and **falsehood**, and thus wields his staff, shouting:\n*\"How dare you falsely invoke the **Buddha’s** name and tarnish the **pure virtue** of the **Tathāgata**?\"*\nHe **denounces the crime** and **demands justice**, with **rightful authority** and **proper words**. Yet the **Tripitaka Master** has already bowed and fallen into the **trap**—even the wisest cannot undo this now!\n\n*\"He was left behind with a **golden gong**, head and feet included. All was bound within it. The **Master and disciples** were seized together, their **bodies and minds** both ensnared. The **Buddha’s** form revealed itself as **demonic**, and the **Arahat** were all **minor demons**.\"*\n\nThis is precisely how the **petty’s Dao** is small yet its **demonic magic** vast—straying into false paths, how could one not waste their **heart of seeking the Way**? The **verse is plain**; no need for **explication**.\n\n*\"What is this **‘golden gong’**?\"*\n\n「“**Gong** (鐙) and “**Nao** (挠)” share the same meaning. Zhuangzi said, *“Heaven generates all things, none sufficient to **nao** (挠) the heart”*—meaning one must remain unyielding in their **Dao/Way** and never bend to falsehood.\n\nThe hearts of the **petty** are crooked, yielding to desires, steadfast yet unmovable, clinging to evil until the end, obstinate in their delusions, utterly dark with no glimmer of insight. This is what is called *“the lowest of the low cannot be swayed”*—like a **golden gong** (金鐙) sealed tight, unable to be pried open or emit a sound. Thus, the **pilgrims** were trapped inside it, in a black void from which they could not escape. Its **power** could even **spread and penetrate** like molten gold, rising to the high or sinking to the low, expertly sealing off all exits. So when I stood in the **high**, it used the **high** to constrain me, and I could not move; when I stood in the **low**, it used the **low** to constrain me, and I could not move. It was all because of its **obdurate, unyielding heart**—no crevice or opening to allow a person to turn or shift.\n\n*\"The **pilgrim** became **immovable like a drill**, the **minor demons**’ **power** too weak to **lift** it; the **Jade Emperor** dispatched the **Twenty-Eight Constellations** with spears, swords, knives, and axes—**bearing, lifting, prying, and levering**—yet the **golden gong** remained **coldly unmoved**.\"* This is precisely *“Heaven generates all things, none sufficient to **nao** (挠) the heart”*—its **shackles** were deep, its **fortress** unbreakable.\n\nThe **Golden-Headed Dragon** (亢金龙) said: *“Gazing upon this treasure, it must surely be a **wish-fulfilling** object.”* Its **black heart** mirrored its **wicked intentions**, yet its **authority and magical power** were enough to **ensnare** beings.\n\nIf a **gentleman** (君子) were unluckily trapped, he must **hold fast to the principle of moderation and rectitude**, **borrowing the strength of the Monkey and the Ox** (猿引犄角) to escape calamity, **concealing his light and entering its darkness** (韬其明而就其暗). Otherwise, none would avoid **disintegration of limbs** or **loss of life**.\n\nThen the **Golden-Headed Dragon** transformed its horn into a **needle-sharp tip**, sliding it along the **seam of the gong** (钹口合缝), using a **force of a thousand pounds** before it could pierce through.\n\nThe *“seam”* (合缝) refers to the **central junction** of the two **gongs**, where their **mouths** open and close. The *“Golden-Headed”* (亢) is neither **flattery** nor **arrogance**, but rather **balanced strength**—neither lowly nor lofty—speaking of **upholding the principle of moderation**, yet its **power surpasses its form**, its **mind as fine as a hair**.\n\n*\"The **pilgrim** drilled the **seam** with its horn tip; its body shrank to the size of a **mustard seed**, crouching within the hole to emerge.\"* This is the **Dao/Way of subtle adaptability and emptiness**, **meticulous research**, **not boasting of its own abilities**, and **relying on the horn**—**discerning the openings within openings**, **treading beyond the heavens** (踏破天外天).\n\n*\"It drew out the **Golden Hoop Staff**, smashing the **golden gong**.\"* With one enlightenment, a thousand illusions dissolved; with one defeat, the **Four Great Elements** were shattered like **minced meat**. How could one rely on the **petty’s Dao/Way**? Even this **old demon** could not help but awaken in terror!\n\nYet its **ambiguous, black heart** could not be swayed or bent, though it could be **recognized and broken**. As for its **theft of the sayings *“All beings are my kin”** and *“All things are shared with me”***, this was the **ultimate truth of the Dao/Way**, beyond what even **humans and gods** could **ensnare or escape**. Hence, there was the **Post-Heaven Bag** (后天袋) as the **greatest calamity**.\n\nThe **demon** declared: *“This place is called **Little Western Heaven** (小西天), for I have attained the **true fruit** (正果), and Heaven bestows upon me this **treasure-hall and precious pavilion**.”* It **claimed to be the **Yellow-Browed Old Buddha** (黄眉老佛), **displaying its powers** to **wager a bet and challenge**, vowing to *“beat you all to death, then go to the **Tathāgata** to fetch scriptures—**the fruit is truly mine!**”* It sought to **make itself the ancestor**, **arrogantly inflating its own greatness**, yet it knew not that it was a **petty thief**, **usurping false titles**.\n\n*\"During the battle, the old demon untied its **old white cloth sack** (旧白布搭儿) and **bundled up all the holy ones** (圣众) within it.\"* Its **rageful heart** surged, and it **dragged many into its net**.\n\n*\"Each was bound tightly, no distinction between good and evil—all were cast to the ground.\"* It sought to **entrap them in its prisons**.\n\nThe **Buddha-Dharma** knows **no discrimination**, **no division between good and evil**—it is the **universal love**. Yet now it was twisted into **universal hatred**, turning the **living into instruments of death**. Its **demonic wickedness** was particularly extreme, hence their **great misfortunes**.\n\nSpeaking of the **Post-Heaven Bag**, it was the **greatest** of all. It embodied the **meaning of *“All beings are my kin”**, *“All things are shared with me”**, and *“The Buddha-Dharma knows no discrimination, no division between good and evil”***. The **sutras** state: *“If a **Bodhisattva** clings to **self-view**, **person-view**, **living-being-view**, or **life-span-view**, then it is not a **Bodhisattva**.”* How different was this from the **Confucian principle of *“boundless impartiality, neither inward nor outward”**?\n\nIf one claims *“The Buddha-Dharma knows no discrimination, no division between good and evil”***, then it **erases the distinctions** between **Yashodhara** (its wife), **Rahula** (its son), and the **filial piety of honoring parents and mourning the dead**—even the **sorrowful deeds** and **teaching of compassion to gods and humans**, all **loyalty, sincerity, filiality, and fraternity** would be **wiped out**. This *“no division between good and evil”* is **evil itself**, hence it is a **false Buddha**.\n\nThe **pilgrim** first **freed itself**, then **its Master**, then **Eight Rules** and **Sha Wujing**, then the **Twenty-Eight Constellations** and the **Five Directions’ Jie Di**, then **its horse**, and finally **retrieved its baggage**. Even in the **chaos of calamity**, it still **ranked kin and strangers, honored and humble, noble and base, urgent and delayed**—**ordering them by degree**. This alone was the **essence of the Buddha’s baggage and staff**—how could it be said that *“The Buddha-Dharma knows no discrimination, no division between good and evil”*?\n\nThus it is said: *“People are important, but the **baggage and staff** are even more important!”* Within the **baggage** were the **passports to pass the gates**, the **brocade and embroidered monastic robes**, the **jewel-encrusted alms bowl**—all **treasures of the Buddha-Dharma**. How could one not treasure them?\n\n“It is said: *‘Your life and your master’s are most critical.* One who reads this may awaken to the truth that those who claim *‘the Buddha knows no distinction, no division between good and evil’* are false Buddhas, destroyers of the Buddha.\n\n*‘When the Pilgrim saw the baggage and staff, he rejoiced greatly, rousing the old demon to battle’*—all for the sake of this baggage and staff. *‘The Pilgrim saw it clearly, but the others did not understand its meaning, and it was all packed inside’*—mixed into the undiscriminating sack of *‘no good, no evil.’* *‘The Pilgrim leapt to the Ninth Heaven, sighing for some time, calming his mind and spirit, questioning his own heart’*—unaware that he despised the empty, rootless arrogance of demons, seeking the Upholder of the Heavenly Magic to quell this great calamity, yet still not reclaiming its true master. Hence it is said:\n*‘Before the Dao is complete, monkeys and horses scatter;\nWithout a steadfast heart and spirit, the Five Phases wither.’*\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Six: The Gods Suffer Poisonous Hands, Maitreya Binds the Demons**\n\nThe Master of One Awakening said: The Six Classics are all methods for cultivating the heart and governing the world, rooted in the sages and worthies, their essence and vitality flowing through them—illuminating the body and extending its function, encompassing both great and small, yet ultimately not departing from the one true treasure of sincerity. Later, vulgar scholars and false scholars plundered their teachings, seizing fame and gain, their intentions and motives driven only by selfish ambition, forgetting their original purpose. They even stole names and pretense, corrupting moral order, committing good deeds while sowing chaos—there was nothing they would not do. What was meant to save the world became instead a tool for its ruin. Their guilt is beyond measure!\n\nZhuangzi said, *“The Confucian scholars use the *Poetry* and *Documents* to dig up graves.”* I say that the Confucian scholars use the *Poetry* and *Documents* to extinguish nature and harm life—how different is this from the Yellow-Brow Boy secretly stealing the Buddha’s treasures from the undiscriminating sack, then pretending to be the Buddha and causing mischief? Here, the Immortal Master uses the Yellow-Brow’s false Buddha as a metaphor to expose the harm of false Confucianism, warning against its corruption of the world and human hearts.\n\nWhen people’s hearts are clouded and unprincipled, only the grace of the sages’ *Poetry* and *Documents* can enlighten and guide them, leading to harmony and salvation. Yet today’s false Confucians borrow the Way of Yao and Shun but follow the deeds of thieves; they claim the words of Confucius and Mencius while pursuing their own predatory ambitions. Their destructive schemes surpass even floods and ferocious beasts. Even the sages could do nothing against them, hence the comment: *“The Great Sage has no recourse.”*\n\n「The reader may say that the False Buddha of *Xiao Leiyin* should be countered by seeking the True Buddha of *Daleiyin* to rectify it—why then does he neglect this and instead engage in the deeds of *Wudang* and *Nicang*? Is this not an unnecessary detour, stumbling and faltering in vain?\n\nAlas! The author’s profound discourse and grand writings on the Way and human hearts are buried in obscurity. The two Immortal Ancestors—one pacifying the Northern realm, the other subduing the *Sizhou* waters—both manifested their powers through taming floods. Yet fierce beasts, venomous dragons, water spirits, and all manner of tortoises, serpents, and dragon generals were not only conquered but also *put to use* by them. Thus, even floods and ferocious beasts are easier to tame.\n\nTracing their origin from birth to enlightenment, recounting their might in subduing divine beings and mastering supernatural abilities—without these two Ancestors, none could have calmed the chaos. Yet today, not only can they not calm the chaos, but the very generals of the gods are *stripped away* and seized—this is the ultimate evil of false teachings, far worse than floods and ferocious beasts! How could one not weep bitterly at this sight?\n\n*\"The Wanderer, weeping before the Functionary, said:*\n‘Now I am ashamed to ascend the Celestial Palace, humiliated to stand before the Southern Seas. I dread to ask the Buddha of the origins, and am distressed to behold the Jade Image of the Tathāgata.\nThose who were seized—true *Zhenwu* tortoises, serpents, and the Five Dragons—have left me no means to seek salvation. What am I to do?’\n\nAh, wondrous Immortal Master! Does the Wanderer truly grieve, fear, or feel shame and remorse, shedding tears as such? The deeper sorrow lies in the lamentation that the Heavenly Immortals and the Buddha’s teachings were established to *save the world and deliver from calamity*, yet scholars today *exploit these teachings to bring harm to the world*, seizing their truth while indulging in falsehoods. Even the Bodhisattvas and Tathāgatas have no recourse.\n\nWhen one reflects on their origins and contemplates their form, the anguish becomes unbearable. How can one endure to see such corruption again?\n\nThe sages left their teachings to *guide the wise and transform the ignorant*, to cultivate the body and mind for the benefit of all beings. Yet today, their words are *plundered to gratify desires*, their principles *stolen to nurture deceit*.\nFloods can be tamed, but this false tide cannot; ferocious beasts can be subdued, but this venom cannot.\nIf the *Nishan* and *Sizhou* were to arise today, they would surely *harmonize with the false teachings of Wudang and Sizhou* and find no means to counter them.\n\nAlas! The Wanderer, as a disciple of the Buddha, fears to behold the Tathāgata; yet if the Wanderer were a Confucian scholar, he would be ashamed to ascend the *Xingtan* platform, distressed to hear the *Biyu* bell tolling.\n\nIt is not merely a matter of sorrowful lamentation, but rather an urgent warning against the severity of false teachings as a calamity.\n\nThat demon, upon seeing the tortoise, serpent, and dragon generals, raged and said:\n*“What power do these beings possess?”*\nThe Four Generals of the Prince of *Taizi* laughed and replied:\n*“What means do you have? You can only bully the water monsters of the Huai River.”*\nIn their unbridled rage and joy, they defile the gods and mock the sages, winning battle after battle, yet all are *seized and stripped away*—how can their harm not surpass that of floods and ferocious beasts?\n\nAt this dire and pitiful moment, only the foremost Buddha of the *Extreme Bliss Realm* can open His laughter, uphold the teachings of the world, and point to the true hearts of heaven, earth, and humanity—urging each person to *plant seeds of sincerity* in the fundamental nature, to *strive earnestly for genuine return*, and to *banish external false teachings*, seeking instead the already *shattered gold* of their original truth. This is the true *pillar to steady the raging waves*, the divine staff to crush the venom.\n\nSuddenly, the Wanderer sees *Maitreya* descend, pointing to the *post-heaven sack* as the *sowing sack for humanity*—the foundation of *benevolent heart* and *benevolent governance*, encompassing all phenomena of heaven and earth. It is not something to be *stolen and used to deceive the ruler or mislead the world*.\nThe *Rangyabar* (狼牙棒) is the *striking mallet of the cosmic drum*—a sacred instrument to *awaken the customs and rouse the deluded*, enlightening the wise, the foolish, the virtuous, and the unprincipled. It is not to be *wielded to harm others or bring suffering to the multitude*.\n\nThe way to rectify this is to *pursue sincerity*;\nthe way to pursue sincerity is as clear as *planting melons*.」\n\nThe *sowing of melons yields melons*—the principle of planting roots and cultivating truth. *Maitreya* sows a field of melons and fruits to tempt their thirsty cravings, demonstrating the way to abandon superficiality and embrace reality. The method of action must first restrain and regulate, suppressing their old cunning.\n\nWrite the character **\"restraint\"** (禁) upon the palm, wield it in the hand so that no falsehoods, extravagance, ostentation, or avarice may arise. Attack and retreat in turn. Release restraint and use inducement, gradually drawing them near to truth, then seizing the opportunity to enlighten them; penetrate their core, making them aware of the critical bond between life and *Dao*, thereby subduing them and capturing their hearts. This is the great *pillar to steady the raging waves*’ technique of transforming the melon within, seizing the entrails, and striking at the heart to awaken their minds.\n\nThat demon then cries out, *\"Master, spare my life!\"*—only then does it recognize that life and *Dao* are the most precious of treasures, and the true Master is revealed. Afterward, the *post-heaven sack* and the *striking mallet of the cosmic drum* cannot be wielded in reverse, to harm the world.\n\nEating the melon’s reality reveals that true learning lies in the *Dao* of life; entering the *sack of Maitreya* reveals that the *sack of the Way* is rooted in one’s own self. Scattered fragments of truth must be gathered into unity; old habits, once abandoned, must be returned to their original source.\n\nThe Buddha and the Patriarchs return to *Extreme Bliss* (极乐), the gods each resume their proper stations, the disciples escape calamity and gain freedom, abandoning the *Small Thunder Sound* (小雷音) for the *Great Thunder Sound* (大雷音)—all this is the pursuit of the fundamental truth. Alas! The *yellow-browed* (黄眉) ones borrow the *sack of Maitreya*, which encompasses all phenomena, to become the *abyss of greed* that devours all beings. How tragic! Yet fortunately, the reality of the melon is obtained to reclaim them.\n\nNow, among the *Confucian, Buddhist, and Daoist* schools, many *yellow-browed* ones wield the *cosmic drum* and the *sack* together. How can one expect the *Wanderer* to endure such widespread planting of *Eastern Ling* (东陵) and the burden of repeated action?\n\n**The Sixty-Seventh Chapter: Rescuing the Steadfast *Dharma-nature* of the *Tālā* (驼罗) Hermit, Freeing the Pure *Dao-heart* from Defilement**\n\nThe text states: *\"This book reveals that great concealment does not prevent dwelling in the marketplace, but one must not be corrupted by market vices; detachment from dust does not prevent entering dust, but one must not be stained by worldly traces.\"* The false *immortals* of the *Wood Immortal Hermitage* (木仙庵) and the pseudo-*Buddhas* of the *Small Thunder Sound* (小雷音), though they appear to have devised their own methods, seem to avoid the world’s clamor and shun the dust—yet they are not the true essence of great concealment.\n\nAt the beginning, the *Three Treasures* (三藏) said, *\"Let us seek lodging along that path?\"* The Wanderer replied, *\"The lodging lies ahead.\"* These words teach one to accept whatever arises and not to precalculate.\n\nThe *Immortal Master* (仙师) thus set forth the analogy of *sparse persimmons* (稀柿) and *extreme filth* (极污). The persimmon, once fallen, has just left the \"wood\" (木) to become the \"market\" (市). The *Seven Emotions* (七情) are likened to the seven passions of man. Love and attachment are hard to sever, yet they ultimately lead to poisonous harm. Accumulated over time, they become defilement; deep-rooted obstacles become mountains. The *yin-qi* (阴气) breeds into a *serpent’s den* (蟒穴), and the *Kāngzāng* (康庄) path transforms into the *Swine’s Way* (豕途). This is the origin of the *Tālā* Hermit’s *long serpent* (长蛇) that devours people, and the *Seven Emotions Mountain* (七绝山) that blocks the road like a *walled-off boar* (封豕).\n\n*\"Tālā\"* (驼罗) is the *Sanskrit* term for *Tāla* (陀罗净土), the *Pure Land*. *\"Five hundred or more households\"* (共有五百多家) refers to the *Arhats* (罗汉), those who dwell there. The *Buddhist canon* (释典) names them *\"Arahat\"* (阿罗汉), meaning those who have extinguished all passions, capable of receiving universal offerings, untouched by the three realms, far from all evil, and enjoying pure *Dharma-nature* (禅性稳). Yet now, dwelling beside the *sparse persimmons*, they suffer continuous attacks by serpentine demons, their livestock devoured, their men and women in fear and peril—this is the *Dharma-nature* (性) of a neighbor to a *serpent’s den* (蛇窟), the *Pure Land* (净土) turned into a *field of slander* (舌场). How precarious it is, like one drowning or burning, needing urgent rescue!\n\nOnly one with great wisdom and great *pillar to steady the raging waves*’ power, such as the *Wanderer* (孙行者), can easily dispel and drive away such calamities, bringing peace to the world. Could those ordinary monks who rot like *spoiled melons* (烂西瓜) or those ordinary Daoists who are *boiled chickens* (落汤鸡) truly stabilize the *Dharma-nature* (禅性) and purify the *Dao-heart* (道心)?\n\nOnly the Wanderer’s supreme methods can be relied upon to shoulder this burden—no other can be summoned. Yet if one does not purify oneself and minimize attachments, or if one lingers over gold, silver, or fields, then it is greed and the pursuit of profit, consorting with the market’s vices. Even if one unites in removing harm, it remains an attack by one demon against another—never to be allowed.\n\nThus, the Wanderer appears to teach and demonstrates that, though he values gold and silver, he does not indulge in market corruption; though he sees fields, he does not fish with the market’s tricks. All this is but the accumulation of virtue.\n\nThe market’s heart is full of deceitful schemes, yet it resembles a serpent. The *Dao* scriptures say, *\"The serpent of passions sleeps in your heart\"*—this is it. Its accumulated habits are such that it seizes cattle and horses, it seizes chickens and geese, it seizes men and women—regardless of size or status, it is well-practiced in devouring them. Its eyes hang like twin torches, revealing hidden profits in the dark; its tongue dances like double hooks, swiftly blocking and misleading on either side. Only until dawn, when the *heavenly heart* (天心) resets, does it hesitate and conceal itself, yet its head and tail remain exposed, unable to escape the discerning gaze of the wise.\n\nWhen its *qi* (气) is strong, the *soft-shafted spear* (软柄枪) displays boundless crafty tricks; when its path is exhausted, the *great mouth* (巨口) swiftly swallows all in an instant. Ah! How fearsome it is!\n\nThe common man fears it, dreading its fangs and jaws;\nThe perfected one confronts it, as if seeing its lungs and liver.\n\nThe perfected one’s body is firm and pure, untainted by grinding or dyeing.\nThus, though he walks through the marketplace with his mind,\nHe is not swayed by it;\nThough he enters the dens of profit,\nHe is not harmed by them.\n\nThe most wondrous lies in the two meanings of *building a bridge in the serpent’s belly* and *changing the boat*:\nTo consume fat and blood while growing sluggish flesh—\nWhat compares to an empty stomach harnessing the eastern rainbow,\nAccumulating virtue through beneficial deeds?\nTo hoard wealth and fatten the phantom’s back—\nWhat compares to bankruptcy and building a vessel of compassion,\nAccumulating virtue through giving and relief?\n\nExtinguishing the evil karma of cravings,\nBinding the universal cause for universal liberation—\nFear and terror vanish,\nEach fulfills its nature,\nMerit and virtue complete,\nAll find peace in their essence—\nWhat joy surpasses this?\n\nHenceforth, with sincere heart and empty vessel,\nTransforming form and cultivating the Way:\nExpanding the heart-mind of ten thousand ages,\nLong-blocked alleys now restored to their ancient paths;\nBreaking free from the entanglements of a thousand years,\nAccumulating filth like the Gourd Ridge,\nYet all attain enlightenment together.\n\nThis is as the Inner Canon of the Mysterious Sovereign states:\n*\"Facing phenomena while forgetting them,\nNot sinking into the six demonic magics;\nDwelling in dust yet transcending it,\nNot falling into the transformations of myriad entanglements.\"*\n\nThus the poem concludes:\n*\"All desires and dusty emotions are severed,\nPeaceful and unobstructed, bowing to the Lotus Platform.\"*\n\nAh!\n\nAh! Marvelous indeed—\nWherever the Lotus Platform is glimpsed, each person’s heart becomes a Pure Land;\nWhere the Divine Flower Treasury is revealed, every household finds a path to the Western Heaven.\n\nTo transcend the Gourd Ridge’s filth and reach the Lotus Platform—\nWho is pure, who defiled?\nWho is blocked, who unobstructed?\nOnly the individual may awaken to this.\n\nYet why does the Camel’s Horn Village fear the serpent and not simply depart?\nWhy does the Gourd Ridge’s accumulated filth remain, its trees uncut?\nPerhaps it is that the land has no harsh governance,\nAnd the roots of karmic affliction are not easily eradicated!\n\n---\n**Sixty-Eighth Chapter**\n*The Tang Monk Discusses Past Lives in the Land of Vermilion and Purple*\n*The Monkey King’s Three Broken Arms*\n*A Disciple Awakens:* This passage, up to the seventy-first, elucidates the cultivation of the Great Dao of Refining the Golden Elixir. Only Zhang Boduan’s *Awakening to Reality* captures its essence—one should follow his teachings with reverence, as the concluding section on *\"The True Person’s Rustic Robe\"* makes clear.\n\nThe heading explicitly declares *\"Land of Vermilion and Purple,\"*\nConnoting the nobility of vermilion and purple,\nYet inverting to suggest that none surpasses the authenticity of Boduan.\n\nThe Lacquered Sage speaks of *\"The Ox Adorned in Brocade,\"*\nThe Master Confucius views *\"Wealth and Honor as Fleeting Clouds,\"*\nZilu values *\"The Noble’s Rank Above Silk-Beams,\"*\nAnd Jin Ping warns of *\"High Chariots and Four Horses Bringing Ruin.\"*\nChen the Recluse writes:\n*\"Though Purple Avenues teem with vain display,\nVermilion robes, though noble, pale beside poverty.\"*\n\nFrom antiquity, sages have given profound counsel—\nYet how is it that people read ten thousand volumes and a thousand scriptures\nAnd still fail to recognize the letters?\n\nThe Monkey King immediately roars in awakening:\n*\"Master, you do not recognize the three great characters—'Land of Vermilion and Purple'!\"*\n\nFor vermilion and purple dust and glory are but illusions, dream-bubbles;\nImperial capitals and royal domains are but transient echoes of Zen.\n\n「To know what comes next, one must observe the past;\nThe past, viewing the future, is like the future viewing the past.\n\nThus, the Tripitaka traces back to the Three Sovereigns and reaches the Five Emperors,\nFrom yielding to others to waging conquests;\nContending for succession, merging and struggling for dominance;\nAlternating between governance and chaos, life’s span stretched yet unequal,\nOnly to finally converge in the dream of the Tang King.\n\nAlas! Within the winding, circuitous discourse,\nLies an infinite lament of sorrowful, profound truths.\n\nJust as the yellow apricot flags atop the city walls,\nFlutter wildly in the wind—\nIf not for old Sun Wukong’s clear vision,\nEven if you master celestial lore, know geography, and debate *yin-yang*,\nOr if you govern the realm and found states,\nSend books to the *Yin Du* underworld,\nExtend lives through alchemical arts,\nAll these efforts are but the work of *\"Weizheng the Omen.\"*\n\nFar better is to worship the Buddha,\nTake the *Mahayana Sutras* of the Three Baskets,\nAnd ascend to heaven by transcending the sufferings of karma!\n\n*The Fa Yuan Zhu Lin* states:\n*\"Though the peacock boasts a splendid form,\nIt cannot fly as far as the wild crane;\nThough vermilion robes carry wealth and honor,\nThey cannot match the virtue of renouncing the world.\"*\n\nThe kings of vermilion and purple,\nThough adorned with splendor, face peril in their bodies;\nThough their robes hold wealth and honor, their hearts ache with suffering—\nLamenting that no one comes to save them,\nYet they do not suffer the same fate as the Tang King,\nWho dreamt his way into hell?\n\nThose who gather at the *\"Hui Tong Hall\"*—\nMeet without appointment, align without plan;\nAncient and modern worlds differ not,\nYet their boundaries share the same rules.\n\nA king wears vermilion and purple while feasting on *guanglu* honors,\nWhile common folk chase after food and fame, seeking profit and name.\nBoth share the same cravings of mouth and body,\nYet both fall ill unto the marrow of life’s vitality.\n\nThus, when the Eighth Rule hears of wine, rice, silk, and brocade,\nOr fragrant foods, he cannot help but drool and enter the market.\n\nWhen the Pilgrim sees the royal edict calling for worthy men,\nAnd lands of vermilion and purple,\nHe cannot help but joyfully rush to serve as a royal physician.\n\nIn truth, wandering east to west, pursuing worldly gains is but a fleeting illusion;\nOne must know that bowing to lift the royal edict,\nAnd accepting fate to heal the realm, is also of utmost importance.\n\nThe Eighth Rule seeks food and gains renown,\nYet unexpectedly, he ponders the royal physician’s edict—\nGrandfathers, fathers, sons, and grandsons,\nNurses and elders—\nAll vie for the empty title in unison.\n\nThe Pilgrim, though jesting, acts with earnestness,\nAs if he truly holds the king’s position—\nRevered and honored, obeyed and worshipped,\nWith ranks arrayed and bowing in procession—\nIn moments, he becomes a puppet.\n\nFor any true hero,\nTheir words are sharp and striking beyond measure—\nThus, if the vulgar do not flinch, it is not the mark of a hero;\nFor one with genuine wisdom,\nTheir actions are swift yet deliberate, not reckless—\nThus, if the first move is not refused, it is not true wisdom.\n\nThis is how the Pilgrim steps forward with a stern voice,\nAnd how the king is startled into submission—\n*\"Dismiss him!\"*\n\nWhat truly startles the listener,\nIs not *\"stepping forward with a stern voice,\"*\nBut *\"a thousand years without relief.\"*\n\nIf one does not cultivate the Dao,\nEven if their schemes for wealth and honor succeed,\nIt is but a ghostly, fleeting existence—\nA life bound to death.\n\nBorn with sickness, dying from sickness;\nLiving as a sickly mortal, dying as a suffering ghost;\nThrough countless kalpas of rebirth,\nWhen will this suffering end?\nA thousand years without relief—\nIf spoken of in terms of *wànjié* rebirth,\nDoes it not startle the ignorant?\n\nThe depths of wisdom lie not in *\"hanging threads to diagnose pulses,\"*\nBut in *\"each of the three fine hairs measuring twenty-four feet.\"*\n\n*The Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon*, *The Classic of Difficulties*, *The Fundamentals of Herbal Medicine*, and *Pulse Decisions*\nServe only to cure momentary ailments,\nAnd prolong a single life.\n\nIf medical skill is commonplace,\nThen the three fine hairs are likened to the Three Passes—\n*Tian Guan* at the hand, *Di Zhu* in the heart—\nAnd the five movements correspond to *jing*, *qi*, and *shen*.\n\nTo align the three fine hairs with the twenty-four *qi* of the seasons,\nAnd to harmonize the three conditions with the seventy-two *hou* of fate—\nThis is to treat diseases spanning thousands of years;\nA grand masterpiece of medical wisdom—\nYet the world struggles to grasp its profundity!\n\nThus, the Daoist sage concludes with this instruction:\n*\"The heart holds secret prescriptions to heal the realm,\nWithin it lies the wondrous formula for eternal life.\"*\n\nI once visited Jingyang,\nAnd inscribed this couplet at the Temple of the Medicine King:\n*\"How many commoners’ afflictions exist?\nDrink it, eat it—\nBetter seek the Daoist’s elixirs for true cures;\nThe world’s incurable maladies in countless forms—\nNames and profits—\nWhat compares to the white clouds atop the mountain?\"*\n\nThe compiler, it seems, must recognize the phrase *\"Zhūzǐ Guó\"* (Jade-Purple Realm) and be willing to shatter the butterfly dream of the mortal world—then proceed to read this book together.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Ninth**\n*The Heart’s Nighttime Alchemy*\n*The King’s Feast on Demonic Heresies*\n\nA sage once said:\n*\"Floating glory and vain pursuits—\nA dream steeped in yellow millet;\nWorldly tastes and dusty bonds—\nSwift as sparks on stone.\"*\n\nMen call this the common talk of old monks,\nSaying that within ritual teachings lies a place of joy.\nYet in truth, one’s life is but restless toil—\nClutching wind, embracing shadows—\nAnd in an instant, eternal slumber descends.\nFrom ancient times to now, how many have truly awakened?\n\nLu Zong said:\n*\"Seeking fame and fortune births hell’s torment,\nRitual propriety kills in the prison of the heavens.\"*\nTruly, this awakens the dream and shatters delusion!\n\nThe Daoist sage’s work here\nSpecially highlights the pure night’s sincere heart,\nPointing to the path of awakening for self-recognition.\nFor to cultivate the Dao, one must first purify the heart;\nTo purify the heart, one must first dispel illness;\nTo dispel illness, one must first know its roots.\n\nThe ancient divine physicians,\nGazing at the lofty walls, their skill astounding the two young men.\nHanging threads to diagnose pulses—\nNot absurd, but rather describing\nDeep contemplation leading to penetration,\nSilent cultivation reaching divine insight.\n\nAs birds have fixed mates, so too their cries when separated;\nAs humans cannot have one polarity dominate, so too illness arises from imbalance.\nThe marvelous prescriptions of medicine—\nThe blind and foolish cannot grasp them.\n\nThe Medical Officer said:\n*\"The eight hundred and eighty flavors—\nNot all are used,\"*\nSeeing that their use cannot be exhaustive.\n\nThe Wanderer said:\n*\"Medicine does not cling to formulas,\nThus it fully conquers,\"*\nSeeing that the formula’s essence lies in its application.\n\n*\"Eight hundred and eighty flavors,\"*\nClarifying the number two-eight.\nTwo-eight refers to what *The Parametric Concordance* calls\nNine Returns, Seven Circulations, Eight Reunions, Six Residences.\nNine and seven are yang numbers, combining into sixteen—\nThe full essence of a man’s true *jing*.\nEight and six are yin numbers, combining into fourteen—\nThe arrival of a woman’s *tian gui*.\nTaking the moon’s waxing and waning as symbols,\nThus it is also said:\n*\"The waxing phase—eight of *Dui*,\nThe waning phase—eight of *Gen*—\nTheir combined essence forms the *Kan* and *Kun* bodies.\"*\n*\"Two-eight corresponds to one *jin*,\nThe *Yijing*’s unshaken truth.\"*\n\n*The Awakening to Reality* says:\n*\"When the moon first hangs half-lit in the sky,\nAlready the dragon’s roar and tiger’s growl resound.\nNow is the time to refine the two-eight,\nWithin a single hour, the elixir is complete.\"*\nSpeaking of yin-yang union,\nThe opportune moment for alchemical refinement.\n\nThus the Wanderer says:\n*\"When night is still, we best prepare the medicine.\"*\n*\"By midnight, the streets lie empty, all sounds hushed,\nEight Rules said, ‘Brother, hurry—let’s act early.’\"*\nAll pointing to the urgency of the two-eight’s timing.\n\nTaking *dàhuáng* (great yellow), the utmost yin;\nAnd *bādòu* (croton seed), the utmost yang.\n*\"Dà\"*—one, *rén* (person);\n*\"Bā\"*—one, *jǐ* (self).\nPerson and self unite, essence complete—\nYin and yang harmonized, the medicine is ready.\n\nThus Eight Rules said:\n*\"Eight hundred and eighty flavors—\nJust these two suffice,\nTruly capable of reviving the dead, defying heaven’s will,\nAnd becoming the complete elixir.\"*\n\nEarlier, the Three Treasures answered the king:\n*\"Three stubborn brutes—none know the nature of the medicine.\"*\nNow, the Sand Monk is well-acquainted with *dàhuáng*’s cold nature,\nEight Rules deeply versed in *bādòu*’s heat—\nYet if one clings only to the properties of the herbs,\nEven knowing them, how can one heal the realm?\nStill, they remain unenlightened.\n\nThe Wanderer said:\n*\"My brother, you do not know.\"*\n\nThe Wanderer said:\n*\"You too do not know.\"*\n\nHe spoke of these two flavors repeatedly as *\"unknown\"* to urge careful study of their subtleties—one must not grasp at superficial traces alone.\n\nIn the text, *\"spun fine\"*—when spoken of medicine, yet not just of medicine.\n\n*\"Bai cao shuang\"* (Hundred Herbs’ Frost) takes the harmonizing of the earthen tripod;\n*\"Long ma niao\"* (Dragon-Horse Urine) draws from the treasures of the Water Palace.\n\n*\"Guo hui\"* (Kettle Ash) and *\"jin zhi\"* (Golden Juice)—their meaning is clear.\n\nWhen stirred together as *\"San Jiu\"* (Three Nines), it gathers the Five Phases and divides the Three Realms.\n\nNamed *\"Wu Jin Dan\"* (Black Gold Pill), to reveal the essence of the Golden Elixir—the sovereign’s secret remedy lies here.\n\nAh! How wondrous!\n\nThe Immortal Master feared the world might remain ignorant, so within the medicine’s ingredients, he embedded six hidden marvels, each laden with meaning.\n\n*\"Laoya\"* (Old Crow) is the yin of the *Lǐ* (Trigrams: *Lǐ* 离), taking its *qi*;\n*\"Lǐ yú\"* (Carp) is the yang of the *Kǎn* (坎), drawing its essence.\n\n*\"Wangmu fen\"* (Queen Mother’s Powder) is the yin-earth *jǐ* (己);\n*\"Laojun hui\"* (Laozi’s Ash) is the yang-earth *wù* (戊).\n*\"Toujin san kuài\"* (Three Headcloths) gathers the three blossoms of the crown;\n*\"Long xu wu gen\"* (Five Dragon Whiskers) encircles the five radiant yangs.\n\nTaking the body’s *qi* and essence, combining *wù* and *jǐ* to form the *gui* (圭), this is the marvelous Dao of Three-Five.\n\nThese are formless substances, arising from the void—beyond the ken of ignorant physicians. Hence it is said:\n*\"This is something the world cannot possess.\"*\n\nThe vulgar claim this remedy excels in curing false illnesses, unaware that common speech conceals profound principles, not deceit.\n\nEven ordinary medicine uses rootless water, yet it too descends from heaven;\nIf the Dragon King sneezes and spits his essence, it is no ordinary rainwater.\n\nAs the Mud Pill Master said:\n*\"Saliva and spittle, precious fluids—\nOnly they can serve as the ladder to ascent.\"*\n\nWhen the essence transforms into ambrosial dew,\nThree cups descend the Three Nines,\nLike the unceasing sound of a waterwheel,\nPiercing the Three Passes—\nAnd the root of illness vanishes.\n\nThis remedy heals the realm like a god—\nWhy not record it on bamboo and silk,\nSo all under heaven, in future ages, may take and nourish themselves?\nYet it is kept secret—why?\n\nThe Practitioner spoke: *\"The king is indeed a great sage of virtue and power,\"*\n*\"I shall assist you and stand by him.\"*\n\nThis wisdom is not lightly given—\nOnly to those of true virtue and power may it be entrusted.\n\nThe Ancestor said:\n*\"Gain a worthy disciple yet fail to pass on the Heavenly Treasure,\nAnd pass it to the unworthy, the Seventh Patriarch suffers.\"*\n\nExamine the past: the Purple Yang True Person thrice passed it to the unworthy,\nAnd thrice met Heaven’s retribution—\nA lesson to be heeded!\n\nHow could it be openly inscribed on bamboo and silk?\nThus, the Eighth Precept spoke of *\"horse in the medicine\"*,\nYet ceased to reveal it afterward;\nThe Practitioner, in anger at his concealment,\nSuddenly invoked *\"the Horsehoe Herb\"* as a cover—\nAll to show that such secrets must not be recklessly divulged,\nLest calamity be invited.\n\nThe later text foreshadows the **Tài Suì**’s resolution of the Golden Bell,\nThe welcome of the Golden Saint,\nAnd the true method for refining the Golden Elixir.\nYet without knowing the cause of its dispersion,\nOr recognizing the marvel of its return,\nOne cannot grasp the king’s words at the feast,\nWhich reveal the root of the *\"lost and scattered\"* affliction.\n\nThe **Black** is the essence of the *Lì* hexagram—\nIt has its primordial mate,\nBut when separated, it does not return.\nThe **Black** alone, without pair,\nThough it can internally nourish the Five Spirits,\nCannot externally harmonize with the One Qi.\nIt dispels only later-acquired diseases within the body,\nYet fails to retreat the original external afflictions.\n\nThus, even the *\"Black-Gold Elixir\"* is not yet the pure Yang,\nThe true crimson-gold Elixir.\n\nThe king said:\n*\"At the very time of the Duan’yáng festival,\nIn the Sea-Pomegranate Pavilion, I watched the Dragon Boat races.\nSuddenly, a gust of wind arose,\nAnd a demon appeared—\nIt called itself the **‘Rival Tài Suì’**,\nDwelling in the **Qílín Mountain’s Xiè Zhì Cave**,\nAnd had seized the Golden Saint Palace to take it away.\"*\n\nThe **Duanwǔ** festival marks the throat of Heaven—\nA sudden wind rising,\nThe Six Yangs first encounter One Yin, forming the *Gòu* hexagram.\nThe *Gòu*—Heaven’s wind—\n(□ hexagram diagram omitted);\nThe gradual onset of *Bō*—\nThe root of *Fù*.\n\nIn a man’s body,\nIt is like first taking a woman and craving her child,\nOr racing dragon boats and delighting in frivolity—\nHence the saying: *\"Riding in the Flower Garden Sea-Pomegranate Pavilion,\nEngaging in Dragon Boat races.\"*\n\nAt this moment,\nThe true gold of the Six Yangs of the *Qián* body is broken,\nAnd sinks into the *Kūn* earth.\nThen the Six Yins of the *Kūn* earth,\nIn turn, obtain the true gold and become *Fù*—\nEarth’s thunder.\n(□ hexagram diagram omitted),\nThe reverse of *Bō*—\nThe end of *Gòu*.\n\nWhen thunder erupts from the earth,\nThe spirit of **Gōu Máng** manifests.\n*\"It calls itself the **‘Rival Tài Suì’**\"*—\nAs if offering true gold and praying to it,\nIs it not a **\"Rival\"**?\n\nThe **Qílín** is the beast of benevolence,\nIts nature is to love all things;\nThe **Xiè Zhì** is the divine sheep,\nIts wisdom discerns deceit—\nIt embodies the heart of love and hatred.\n\nThe **Tài Suì** lurks within,\nAnd seizes the Golden Saint Palace—\nThen I lose what I love,\nAnd exchange it for what I do not love, breeding sorrow;\nI gain what I hate,\nAnd exchange it for what I do not hate, breeding doubt.\nThe maladies of sorrow and doubt arise from this—\nNot the essence of the benevolent who do not sorrow,\nOr the wise who are not confused.\n\nYet after years of sorrow and doubt,\nAfter three years of stagnant accumulation,\nA single dose of the **Líng Dān Elixir** can clear the passage;\nIf the **Tài Suì** is subdued and the Golden Saint welcomed back,\nThe method requires threefold folding—\nIt cannot be easily attained.\n\nAvoiding the Maze Tower cannot keep evil at bay,\nFor one who flees the true south\nCannot ensure the evil’s departure.\n\nInstead, one must recognize it—\nOnly when recognizing its nature\nDoes one know the disease’s root,\nAnd can refine the medicine to cure the illness\nAnd bring peace to the realm.\n\nHence it is said:\n*\"To pacify the realm, first know the king’s affliction;\nTo uphold the Dao, remove the heart of love and hatred.\"*\n\nThe *\"king\"* refers to the **Heart Sovereign**;\nThe *\"heart of love and hatred\"* is the **Sovereign’s Heart**.\n\n**Chapter Seventy: The Demon’s Jewel Sets Off Smoke and Sand Fires; Tripitaka’s Disciple Steals the Purple Gold Bell**\n\nTripitaka’s son said: The Dao of the Golden Elixir is the *Yijing*’s Way.\n*Qian* and *Kun* are its gateways,\n*Kan* and *Li* its wondrous applications,\n*Guà* and *Fù* its transformative mechanisms.\n\n*Guà* must inevitably reach *Pǐ*,\n*Pǐ* must inevitably reach *Bó*,\n*Bó* at its extreme must return to *Fù*,\n*Fù* must return to *Tài*.\n\nYin and yang wax and wane, cycling endlessly—\nThis is the \"having come, having gone\" spoken of in the text.\n\nFor those of great cultivation, first possessing a pair of enlightened eyes,\nThey must strike with fierce resolve—\nLest he return to the Flayed-Skin Pavilion.\n\nOnly by secretly penetrating the currents\nCan one make the currents follow me,\nActing at the opportune moment,\nStealing the Purple Gold Bell in reverse,\nWelcoming back the Golden Saint,\nPerfecting the *Qian* essence,\nAnd transcending the mundane.\n\nThe \"Purple Bell\" is the primordial true-yi treasure,\nMingled as one *qi*,\nDivided into the Three Primordials—\nEvery person possesses it fully.\n\nYet at the moment of *Guà*,\nIt suddenly vanishes.\n\nLike a ruler unable to secure internal peace,\nSummoning external chaos,\nCausing the nation to sink into doubt—\nIf not for wise strategies and grand talent,\nPlotting recovery,\nMerely hiding in a demon-avoiding cave\nWill never truly repel the evil.\n\nSeeking the palace maidens three times over—\nHow could this not hasten the nation’s ruin?\n\nAt the royal banquet, one speech reveals the disease’s root;\nIn the drink, the practitioner extinguishes the fire,\nClarifying the elixir’s principles.\nThis is to diagnose the illness and prescribe the remedy—\nA display of masterful governance.\n\nSuch power is the key to unlocking the path of life and death,\nA great Dao passed down by the enlightened master.\n\nIn the verses:\n*\"For the tripod’s furnace,\"*\n*\"Gathering the tortoise and hare,\"*\n*\"Harvesting yin and yang,\"*\n*\"Awakening the Mystic Pass,\"*\n*\"Moving the Heavenly Ganges,\"*\n*\"Shifting the Dipper’s handle,\"*\n*\"Retreating the furnace, advancing the fire,\"*\n*\"Drawing lead, adding mercury,\"*\n*\"Concentrating the Five Phases,\"*\n*\"Harmonizing the Four Symbols,\"*\n*\"Returning the Two *Qi*,\"*\n*\"Uniting the Three Families\"*—\nEach word is the quintessence of the elixir’s alchemical fire and timing,\nAll pointing to the same Purple Bell.\n\nThe *Tài Suì* is fundamentally *Kun* earth,\nYet obtains *Qian* gold—\nAlready *Fù*.\nBut clinging to the female consort to seek *Guà*,\nThis is *Fù* returning to *Guà*.\n\nThus, the *Tài Suì* shakes the Purple Bell,\nReleasing smoke and fire as harm,\nReleasing flying sand as harm—\nThough called a \"strategy,\" it is truly demonic.\n\nThe king loses *Qian* gold and sinks into *Kun* earth—\nAlready *Guà*.\nYet, not forgetting the Golden Saint,\nHe resolves to welcome him back—\nThis is *Guà* returning to *Fù*.\n\nThus, the practitioner acts freely, shifting form to steal,\nChanging \"having come, having gone\" into theft—\nThough called a \"strategy,\" it is truly Tripitaka’s disciple.\n\n\"Having come, having gone\" is the natural flow of Heaven’s principle.\nThose who study the Dao must, within this flow,\nSeek out the marvelous method:\n*\"One immortal sends a five-colored celestial robe\nTo adorn the Golden Saint’s palace.\"*\n\nOnly by opening the \"Dharma-eye of having gone without coming\"\nCan one enter the Dao and attain truth.\n\nThus, the practitioner:\nFirst transforms into a fire-hawk soaring to the heavens,\nSecond into a grasshopper descending to the earth,\nThird into a Daoist acolyte dwelling among mortals—\nPiercing through past and present, above and below,\nAnd striking down \"having come, having gone\" with a single blow.\n\n*\"The battle scroll is hidden in the Three Treasures’ bosom—\nDo not let the king see it.\"*\nWhat words are written within?\nSome truths cannot be put into words,\nAnd must remain secret—\nThis is the marvel of striking down \"having come, having gone.\"\n\nYet how can one strike down the natural flow of Heaven’s principle?\nIs this not deceiving the world?\nNo—striking down is striking to life.\nStriking down means \"having come, having gone\";\nNot striking down means \"neither coming nor going.\"\n\nThus, neither coming nor going\nStill does not depart from the form of having come and gone.\n\nThe practitioner strikes down to achieve the void,\nYet transforms again into existence—\n*\"When existence is true, it becomes illusion;\nWhen nothingness departs, it enters the middle.\nExistence and nothingness neither stand,\nInside and outside are all emptiness.\"*\n\nAh! Marvelous!\n\n---\n\nA pair of golden bells, bright and clear—\ntwo souls bound as husband and wife,\nmatched and entwined, gazing like rings in a chain.\nIf one can pierce through this thing with the Dao’s insight,\nit is the key to subduing demons and reclaiming the Sage.\n\nThe practitioner boldly enters the *Bōpí Tíng* (Shedding-Skin Pavilion),\nignoring the demon king’s questions,\ndisplaying them upon his arm,\nplaying with them within the rites of propriety—\nthus arises the marvel of effortless coming and going,\nthe subtle, perfect penetration of the Dao’s workings.\n\nThough the practitioner appears to manifest \"having come, having gone,\"\nin truth, he is \"neither coming nor going.\"\nThough he seems a trusted general of the Great King,\nin truth, he is a trusted general of the Golden Sage—\nyet he remains the Great King’s trusted general.\nStealing the golden bells is the secret technique\nof the Sage’s subordinate to restore them.\n\nThree golden bells:\nFire is the *shén* (spirit),\nSmoke is the *qi*,\nSand is the *jīng* (essence).\nWhen moved and shaken,\nsmoke, fire, and sand disperse as demons.\nWhen still and embracing the void,\ngolden fire merges in the palace and congeals as the elixir.\n\nThis treasure is found in every home,\nyet it fell into the demon’s grasp through the *gǔ* (fortuitous encounter) of the queen,\nnot originally belonging to the fiend.\nThe way to reclaim it\nmust still pass through stealing from the demon’s hand.\nThus, the loss of the bells stems from the *gǔ*,\nand their recovery must also arise from the *gǔ*.\n\nIf not for the bond of husband and wife,\ntheir mutual joy and delight—\nif he did not take and hide the bells with her,\nhe could never act.\nThis is why it is said:\n*\"The thief in disguise steals as a husband.\"*\n\nThe Golden Sage’s palace declares:\n*\"‘Shared pillow, entwined bed—\nthe fate of past lives.’*\nAnd thus the golden bells are tricked out,\nentrusted to her keeping.\nAgain it says:\n*\"‘I have rejoiced with the Great King,\nshared his pleasures.’\"*\nIt feigns the demon’s burning rage,\nto deceive the *jīnglíng* (spirits and essences).\nThe practitioner seizes the opportunity,\nlightly snatching the three golden bells—\nall done with true method.\n\nMost wondrous is *\"seizing the opportunity\"*—\n*\"‘Stay beside me, and when the chance arises,\nsteal my treasure.’\"*\nThe golden bells were entrusted as tokens of a husband’s joy,\nand to steal them is to take what belongs to the husband-wife union\nas one’s own—\nto grasp the transformation of Heaven and Earth’s Dao.\nWithout seizing the opportunity, it cannot be obtained.\nYet one must deeply know the subtleties,\ncalmly and patiently perceive them,\nnot through crude haste or recklessness.\n\nThere follows the tale of *\"one who does not know the peril,\nwho tugs at cotton—\npulling forth smoke, fire, and yellow sand,\ndisturbing the demon king\"*—\nto show why such treasures are hard to gain yet easy to lose.\nThe Immortal Master further uses the demon’s mouth\nto repeat *\"‘Search carefully’\"*—\na reminder to the scholar.\n\nThe Great King and the Golden Sage’s palace,\nare truly husband and wife—\ntruly, for in one *gǔ* (encounter),\nthey suddenly fall into calamity,\nseparated in an instant,\n*\"turning cleverness into folly.\"*\nThe *Tàisuì* (Great Age) and the Golden Sage’s palace,\nare falsely husband and wife—\nfalsely, yet in one *gǔ*,\nthey become treasure, returning to the realm of possibility,\n*\"playful deception turns to truth.\"*\n\nThese closing words are profound.\nScholars, search carefully.\n\n**The 71st Episode: The Practitioner Feigns a Name to Subdue the Monster-Tiger, Guanyin Manifests to Suppress the Demon King**\n\nA disciple said: The *\"Qiāo Yáo Gē\"* (Song of the Divine Stems) states,\n*\"‘Crosswise and upright, no obstruction—\nstillness is non-action, movement is form.’\"*\nCommon folk do not grasp its meaning,\nsaying *\"‘stillness is non-action’\"* is the Dao,\nwhile *\"‘movement is form’\"* is not.\nYet they do not know:\nstillness without movement, movement without stillness—these are mere things;\nstillness within movement, movement within stillness—this is the spirit.\n\nAgain it says:\n*\"‘Wine is a fine friend, flowers a companion;\nin the flower streets and willow lanes, seek the True Person—\nthe True Person appears only among the flowers.’\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"‘Only through wine and flowers does one awaken to eternal life—\ndrink wine, wear flowers, and the spirits and demons weep.’\"*\n*\"The spirits and demons weep\"*—\nthe six bandits and three corpses of the ghostly realm,\nno longer able to rage.\n\nThe ancient Buddhas asked:\n*\"‘Do you know the *lǎopó* (Old Wife) Dharma?\nDo you know the *píkēzi* (Skin-Shell) Dharma?’\"*\nAgain it is said:\n*\"‘The great matter beneath the *jiāshā* (robe) is unclear—most bitter!\nThe great matter beneath the *qúnchāi* (woman’s ornaments) is unclear—even more bitter!’\"*\nAll speak of the profound truth of *\"movement is form.\"*\n\nThe opening lines of this chapter:\n*\"‘Form is emptiness, emptiness is form—\nif one truly penetrates the Dharma of form and emptiness,\nwhy bother refining cinnabar and sulfur?’\"*\nThis is the same meaning.\n\nScholars who do not carefully search\ninstead see it as foolishness,\nnot knowing the wondrous workings within foolishness—\nbeyond the grasp of mere cleverness.\n\nThe practitioner transforms as a foolish fly,\nyet the demon cannot discern his traces—\n*\"‘Subtle and perfect penetration,\ndeeply unrecognizable—\ngreat wisdom as foolishness.’\"*\n\nThis marvel of the golden bells\ncannot be understood without a true master’s whispered instruction.\nThe practitioner, standing by the queen’s ear,\nsoftly calls:\n*\"‘Again feign the rites of husband and wife to lure him in,\nso I may slip away and act.\nDo not fear—I will find another way to save you.’\"*\nThis is the key to secret transmission by ear.\n\nFirst, as husband and wife,\nthe golden bells are gained but not recognized.\nSecond, as husband and wife,\nthe golden bells are understood and may be seized.\nTwo clear instances of husband and wife,\nyet with the marvel of reversed and repeated transformations.\n\nThe queen hears this,\nstartled and doubtful—\nlike one who hears the Dao from the earth\nand is met with skepticism,\nthinking it mere ghost talk.\nThe practitioner says:\n*\"‘I am neither human nor ghost—\nnow I have transformed into a foolish little fly.’\"*\nAh!\nMarvelous!\n\nIn other chapters, the practitioner feigns the form of a fly—\nhis usual technique.\nHere, the transformation into a fly\nis the very truth of the *biànxìng* (shape-shifting).\nNeither spirit nor ghost—just a fly.\nThe golden elixir’s enlightenment is shown\nwhen the fly hums in response.\n\nThe queen said, *\"Do not bewitch me with your sorcery!\"*\nOnly when she was held in the queen’s grasp did she begin to understand and no longer doubt—\nthis was the very essence of *jiéyīng* (embryonic coalescence) taking root.\n\nMaster Sanfeng declared:\n*\"Open the door, I’ll tell you—\nwithout wine or flowers, the Dao cannot be spoken.\"*\n\nMaster Qiu Chuji said:\n*\"Drink wine, eat meat,\nyet guard against the allure of smoke and flowers to curb lust.\"*\n\nFor wine dissolves all obstacles—\nthe Dao does not forbid it,\nso the practitioner said:\n*\"Drinking wine is the highest path.\"*\n\n*Chūnjiāo*—this is the flower.\nSpring is the Flower Festival,\n*jiāo* is the flower’s grace—\nall mere illusion.\n\n*\"The practitioner transforms into her likeness,\nserving beside her—\nnow the moment arrives to strike.\"*\n\nThis is the hidden principle within flowers,\nthe true secret of seizing the celestial opportunity.\n\n*\"The false Chūnjiāo stands beside her, holding the cup,\nsaying: ‘Great King and Queen, tonight you must exchange cups—\na double-happiness goblet!’\"*\n\nThe queen and the demon king spoke only of conjugal matters,\ntheir words thick with passion—\nthe king’s bones softened, his limbs weakened,\nyet he could not touch her.\n\nAll this was real—\nthe very purpose of *\"guarding against smoke and flowers to curb lust.\"*\n\nWhen husband and wife unite,\nthe primordial treasure naturally manifests within them.\n\nBut how could the treasure in his waist reach my hands?\nIt must be seized when he is lost in ecstasy,\nunable to resist—\nonly then can the opportunity be seized.\n\nThus the practitioner transformed into three monstrous forms\nto assault his body,\nwhile the demon lord, unaware, exposed his shame—\nthe golden bells were freed.\n\nThe false Chūnjiāo, waiting beside them,\nobserved carefully—\nthus the moment was seized.\n\nThis was a method with precise timing,\nmost wondrous and divine,\na secret transmission from master to disciple—\nas *Wù Zhēn* says:\n*\"With *Gù* and *Gòu*, the transformations unfold—\nwho says the Golden Elixir cannot succeed?\"*\n\nOnce the golden bells were seized,\nthe false was abandoned for the true—\nthe Golden Saint Queen would naturally reunite,\nand the method of returning the External Elixir was thus demonstrated.\n\nIf one seeks the treasure in the body alone,\nit fails to grasp the ultimate truth of *yīn-yáng* reversal and harmony.\n\nThus the practitioner again called himself *\"External Grandfather,\"*\ndemanding, *\"Return my Golden Saint Queen!\"*—\nthis was to illustrate the principle.\n\nThis Dao is originally a transmission beyond scripture,\nso the queen’s words *\"external instruction\"* clarify its meaning—\ndo not dismiss it as vulgar jest,\nbut recognize its profound intent.\n\nAfter obtaining it, nourishment and protection were essential,\nfor danger and risk must be guarded against—\nthus war was invoked as a metaphor.\n\nWar is perilous, a matter of life and death.\nOnly by maintaining *femininity* without *masculinity*\ncan one preserve it without loss.\n\nThe practitioner said:\n*\"Two and three cycle as six—\nmy femininity, your masculinity.\"*\n\nFor *masculinity* leads to loss;\n*femininity* leads to gain.\n\nThe demon king relied on his shaking bells to assert dominance,\nunaware that he had been outmaneuvered by one who guarded *femininity*—\nhis presence flickered between existence and nonexistence;\n*masculinity* was impossible to grasp.\n\nThe practitioner, guarding *femininity* while shaking the bells,\nunwittingly violated the precepts of the self-sovereign—\nhis essence flickered between presence and absence,\n*femininity* was no easier to maintain.\n\nTo transcend the names of existence and nonexistence,\nto erase the traces of *yīn* and *yáng*,\nthis is the sacred form of Guanyin’s boundless freedom.\n\n*\"Only the cry rang through the void:\n‘Sun Wukong, I have arrived!’\"*\nWas this not the empty void of the *Lingbeng*’s purity,\nwhere smoke and fire instantly vanished?\n\nThe Golden-Haired Mastiff returned to its origin,\nthe purple golden bells restored to their source;\nthe arrow shot at the sparrow was self-inflicted,\nthe wind torn apart was the destruction of its own young.\n\nDisaster arises from oneself and is self-remedied—\nthe Mastiff bore no blame.\n\nJust as the ultimate Dao of the Golden Elixir:\nloss comes from oneself, gain comes from oneself—\nthus it is said:\n*\"Who can free the golden bells from the Mastiff’s neck?\nAsk the one who tied them.\"*\n\nThis is the true transmission of Master Zhuyou,\nrevealed at the time of the Golden Saint’s return to the palace,\nto demonstrate its essence and clarify the doctrine.\n\nThe character *\"宗\"* (ancestral lineage) with *\"木\"* (wood) added,\npiercing through the Golden Saint’s body—\nwhen wood and metal unite in *Gòu*,\nfive-colored light emerges—\nthis is the true ancestral lineage.\n\nAll under heaven, in future generations,\nshould inherit and uphold it.\n\nWearing it for three years,\nremoving it for one day—\nonly then could husband and wife reunite,\n*femininity* and *masculinity* remain in harmony,\n*yin* and *yang* preserve their proper order,\nand the complete meaning of the Golden Elixir be fulfilled—\nthus the great man’s purpose is accomplished.\n\nWhat use are fleeting red and purple glories?\nHence it is said:\n*\"With fate fulfilled, doubts and ailments washed away,\nwith thoughts extinguished, the heart naturally at peace.\"*\n\n**Chapter 72: The Spider Silk Cave—Seven Emotions Obscuring the True Nature**\n**The Filth-Rinsing Spring—Eight Precepts Losing Form**\n\nMaster Wù Yīzǐ said:\nThe earlier lines *\"washed away\"* and *\"thoughts extinguished\"*\nseem to introduce the themes of *\"Spider Silk\"* and *\"Filth-Rinsing.\"*\nReaders may mistakenly take the Seven Emotions as joy, anger, sorrow, fear, love, hate, and desire,\nthus losing sight of their true origin.\n\nEight Precepts losing form means failing to wash away filth entirely—\none must strive for absolute nakedness,\nemptiness of all concerns,\nand purity beyond all stains,\nonly then achieving self-perfection—\nthis seems correct but is not.\n\n*The Cāntóng Zhì* states:\n*\"Discernment through the viscera’s laws,\ninner vision clouded by thought.\nThe Dark Path rejects the Nine-One,\nturbulence corrupts the primordial embryo.\nCountless arts abound—\nthousands upon thousands.\"*\n\nMaster Zhōnglí Wēng said:\n*\"Tears, saliva, semen, breath, blood, and sweat—\nseven kinds of essence, all yin.\nIf these are used as elixir materials,\nhow can one ascend to the Jade Capital?\"*\n\n「The worldly folk arise from the realm of *business* and *perception*,\nyet also depart through the same.\nWhen the one *yang* flees, though the form be that of a man,\nthe body is entirely *yin*—\nnot merely are the seven true essences all *yin*,\nthe five *zàng* and six *fǔ* are also *yin* without *yang*.\n\nIf one seeks to cultivate only these *yin* essences within the *yang*,\nit is *yin* without its counterpart—\nlike a hen brooding an egg,\nhoping to hatch a child,\nyet achieving nothing.\nWhat is hatched instead\nare moths and caterpillars of strange kind—\nsuch as the *yin*-toxic creatures in this tale:\nthe bees, ants, and clams,\nnot the true offspring of one’s original nature—\nhow could one not lose sight of their true source?\n\nEven worse are those who grasp but a trifle of *yin-yang* principles,\nyet fail to comprehend the true *yin-yang* correspondence—\nthey recklessly assume that consorting with women and gathering *yin* essence\nto refine *yin* further,\nleaving their bodies or even their lives behind,\nis most pitiable!\n\nThis is the root of the errors in the \"misguided origin\" and \"losing form.\"\n\nThe opening verse reads:\n*\"The Three Treasures parted from the Red and Purple King,\njust as they were practicing,\nthey saw a household,\nand wished to go and take refuge in a vegetarian hall.\"*\n\nThe allegory speaks of those who seek the Dao:\nthey renounce wealth and nobility,\nyet mistakenly believe they alone can attain it.\n*\"It turned out that household had no men.\"*\nThis is a place of pure *yin* and scarce *yang*—\njust as the poem says,\n*\"the wandering bee mistook the true path.\"*\n\n*\"Silent and still, no roosters or dogs in sound,\"*\nthese two creatures being *yang* are entirely absent—\nthe stillness of *yin* is evident.\n*\"They saw a woman kicking a rubber ball,\"*\na symbol of *yin* and *yang* energies intertwining.\nThe stone cave, stone door, stone table, and stool—\nall are of *yin* essence within and without.\nThus, they summed it up as:\n*\"A chill *yin* atmosphere.\"*\n\n*\"The elder’s heart was alarmed,\nand in secret, he pondered many ills and few blessings,\"*\nhis body and mind, through experience, now doubted.\nYet though alarmed,\n*\"there was no alternative—\nhe had no choice but to sit down.\"*\nFor beyond this, there was no other path to seek.\n\nLittle did he know that within this household,\nthe arranged provisions were merely\nhuman oil, human flesh, and human brains—\nall the *yin* essence of the human body,\nutterly devoid of *yang* energy.\nThus he declared:\n*\"If such things were to be consumed,\nthis monk would never hope to behold the World-Honored One,\nnor obtain the sacred scriptures!\"*\nThis is the same meaning as:\n*\"If one were to use these *yin* essences as elixir materials,\nhow could one ascend to the Jade Capital?\"*\n\nLost in delusion, they fail to recognize the true source,\nmistake the entrance,\nand are entangled endlessly,\nunable to escape—\nlike a rope binding a high-hanging corpse.\nEven if they seek to escape the outer layers,\nthere are still inner layers;\nif they break free from the upper section,\nthere remains the lower.\nThe more they ponder,\nthe more the doors close—\nwhat difference is there\nbetween this and the silkworm spinning endless threads\nat the entrance of a village?\n\nAn outside observer sees them weave through countless layers of Daoist teachings,\nyet knows not that they are merely trapped in the Seven Female Demons of the Silkworm Ridge:\nthe silkworm, the silkworm moth, and the other six.\n\nAlas!\nA single tangled maze with no threads to follow,\nseven enchanted gates forever blocking the path.»\n\nIf one seeks true liberation,\none must first bathe in the natural order of Heaven.\nA spring of primordial filth—born of Heaven—must be raised,\nto be found in the very center of the southern *cùn* (inch),\nwhere the old is cast off and the new is born.\n\nThis place is where celestial immortals dwell,\nyet also where demons tread.\nShould one mistake demons for immortals,\nand then devise new schemes,\neven if the silkworm threads are all consumed,\none will only stray into false and perverse paths.\n\nThus, the practitioner, once transformed,\nbecomes a carrion fly,\nnailed to the roadside—\nand in an instant,\nthough all silkworm flies are gone,\nhe hears the creak of a wooden gate—\nthis is the man who alters his path and falls into another heresy.\n\nTo practice the art of seducing women\nis to hasten one’s own death.\n\nThe practitioner says:\n*\"These seven beauties—\nif they were to keep my master,\nthey would not even fill a single meal;\nif they were to use him,\nthey would not last two days.\nA single touch, and he would be dead.\"*\n\n「Careful calculation reveals that the few who escape being boiled and devoured by the myriad demons are indeed rare.\n\nSpeaking of the hot springs’ origin, it traces back to Hou Yi’s shooting down the sun—nine arrows struck, one remained—symbolizing the *\"yin-path’s aversion to the nine-one\"* [i.e., the excess of yin]. Speaking of the women stripping and bathing, it vividly depicts the alluring beauty that melts the soul.\n\nThose starved for lust, like hungry vultures, will spread their wings and claws, snatch away clothing, and pay no heed to modesty. Those obsessed with seduction, like loach spirits, will slither and probe, their legs and groins writhing, while abandoning their own forms.\n\nThe practitioner and Eight Rules [Eight Precepts]—both demonstrate this in person, revealing their true appearances. Snatching clothing and probing groins are all symbols of seduction and plunder.\n\nWhen qi is strong, *\"they are crude and heavy, unaware of cherishing jade or loving fragrance.\"* When disaster strikes, their entire body is injured, yet they stumble left and right like one struck by blows. *\"Numb limbs, weak legs, dizzying head, blurred vision—even crawling is impossible, only groaning on the ground\"*—these are real consequences. How could such things not end in death? *\"The seven women laugh as they return to their old chamber, while Eight Rules keeps tumbling\"*—they gain nothing from others but harm themselves.\n\nThe *Yin-Shu Jing* [Classic of the Mysterious Pivot] states: *\"Fire is born from wood; when disaster arises, it will surely overcome.\"* This is exactly what is meant.\n\nMoreover, yin manifestations are manifold—some cling to you like a shadow, yet are not of your true kind. Not only can they not nourish the body to form the elixir, but they will turn the entire body into poison. Their offspring—*dry children, ants, clams, spotted creatures, grasshoppers, wax moths, and dragonflies*—will swarm over the limbs, shifting and transforming endlessly, beyond all cure.\n\nEven with medicines like *huang* [yellow], *ma* [hemp], *□* [a missing character, possibly *wu* 鸟戎, \"martial bird\"], *bai* [white], *diao* [falcon], *yu* [fish], and *yao* [hawk], it is already too late—this serves as a profound warning.\n\n*Zhuangzi* says: *\"I guard my form and forget my body, appearing in murky waters while lost in clear depths.\"* I say: *\"If one forgets form while seducing women, lost in clear depths while gazing into murky waters.\"* Such heretical practices must be burned away with fire.\n\n**Chapter 73: Resentment from the Past Brings Poisonous Disaster; The Heart-Master’s Misfortune Luckily Breaks the Light**\n\nMaster Wu Yi said: The earlier text spoke of solitary cultivation gone wrong, leading to schemes of seduction. Now, it shifts from seduction’s folly to the delusion of alchemical refining. All are the work of mistaken speculation by the recognizing mind.\n\nThough they claim to see with ten thousand eyes, believing they’ve spread the Heavenly Net and Earthly Web, their vision extends no further than an inch—blindly practicing, blindly refining. How could they know the subtlety of true yin and yang? It is supremely simple, effortlessly pure, and effortlessly one—boundless in its greatness, yet without internal limits. It is found in daily life, naturally at ease, effortlessly grasped, and unfathomably subtle.\n\nTo refine cinnabar, mercury, and black lead—substances of foreign essence—is to brew poison and invite death. There is no possibility of longevity or transcendence.\n\nPure Yang Master said:\n*\"Alas for Zhang the Prefect of Jiangzhou,\nwho took medicine and lost his sight—his spirit withered.\nHe did not know the True Elixir has no substance—\nto swallow gold and stone is sheer folly!\"*\n\nZi Yang Master said:\n*\"Do not refine the Three Yellows or Four Spirits,\nfor seeking herbs is not the True Way.\nIf one seeks the true lead and mercury,\nthey are not common sand or quicksilver.\"*\n\nBai Juyi said:\n*\"Before Dongyue’s tomb, new graves rise,\nAt Beimang’s mound, the dead lie.\nI’ve heard of those who erred in their elixirs,\nobsessed with the art of eternal life.\"*\n\nThe *Biography of Wei Fu* states:\n*\"Once, one who twice drank the elixir of immortality was found dead in his coffin.\nAnother, after taking a single dose of the knife-elixir, rotted in his grave.\nLu Pi Gong swallowed the Jade Flower, yet worms crawled from his mouth.\nJia Ji swallowed the Golden Elixir, and the stench reached a hundred li.\nHuangdi melted nine tripods on Jing Mountain, yet his tomb remains on Qiao Ridge.\nLi Yu took Cloud-Dispersing Pills to ascend in secret, yet his head and feet were found apart.\nMo Di drank the Rainbow Elixir and drowned himself in water.\nNing Sheng swallowed the Stone Marrow and threw himself into fire.\nWu Guang chopped chives to enter a cold spring;\nXiang Cheng inhaled qi, yet his stomach and intestines rotted away.\"*\n\nAll these prove that alchemical refining and ingestion are not noble pursuits—they are not the Great Dao of natural transformation. These are the golden needles of this very text.\n\nThe *Daozang Song* [Song of the Daoist Canon] says:\n*\"Seeing those who learn Daoism along the streams,\ntheir paths billow with fiery smoke.\nThey no longer await the sun’s light,\nnor do they preserve the essence of yin.\"*\n\nIt laments the deceptive paths of alchemy,\nblocking the natural source of life.\nIt is like seeking to form a fetus from external substances,\nor hoping to bear fruit by gathering flowers—\nsuch attempts are doomed to fail.\n\nThe Daoist master of Huanghua Guan refined mercury and lead.\nOn the gate of his observatory hung a plaque proclaiming *\"Yellow Sprouts\"* and *\"Qixia Flowers\"*—\nsitting and concocting pills, these are the very marks of a practitioner,\nyet they hide their malevolent intentions.\n\nThe Daoist said: *\"This medicine must not be given to yin-people.\"*\nThey know that humans belong to yin,\nyet they fail to see that they themselves are the poison within yin.\n\nThese charlatans, under the guise of secret arts,\ndeaf, blind, and ignorant, covet wealth and seduce the greedy.\nThey will not rest until flesh and marrow are exhausted—\nonly then will their insatiable hunger be sated.\n\nThe seven demons’ complaints—first stealing clothes, then committing deceit—\nare the everyday grievances of their sect.\nThose who harm others now turn to accuse them,\nstill clinging to the flesh of others while claiming others harm themselves.\n\n*\"Fetching the ladder to climb the rafters,\nbringing down the medicine.\"*\nThe medicine has been stored for a long time,\nintended solely to poison others.\nThey scrape the light and pure substance from the cauldron—\nthis is what alchemists call *\"plucking feathers to ascend as a treasure.\"*\n\nThe Daoist said: *\"My treasure, if given to a commoner,\nwould kill them with just a grain—\nonce swallowed, death is certain.\"*\n\n「If given to immortals, it would kill them with just three *lī*—\n*\"Once swallowed, all will perish.\"*»\nHe bitterly pointed out that elixirs of gold and stone are poison beyond compare—\nthose who aspire to them will surely die; one must be cautious indeed.\n\nYet the Great Sage alone knew tea held poison—\nwhy did he not stop it immediately?\nOnly after they had eaten did he intervene to settle the matter.\n\nThe Daoist said: *\"You’ve brought this calamity upon yourself—\ndon’t you realize?\"*\nFor in the Spider Silk Cave, he had taken his alms,\nand disaster struck from deep contemplation without enlightenment;\nin the Filth-Washing Spring, he had bathed,\nand disaster arose from licentiousness beyond restraint.\n\nHe willingly invited the plagues of *xiaoke* (consumption), *laozhui* (wasting sickness), and *taizhe* (emaciation),\nwilling to squander his fortune and sacrifice his life for the death-drug—\nhis resolve was beyond mortal obstruction.\nThus, the evil master could poison him with impunity;\nhe trusted blindly, and though he died, he bore no grudge—\n*\"Self-made misfortune cannot be undone.\"*\n\nAt this end, the seven demonesses’ true nature—\ntheir clinging, pus-and-blood essence—was revealed.\nHow could they ascend?\n\nThe Daoist’s ruthless desire for flesh\nmerely exposed his shortsightedness—\nhow could he transcend?\n\nThough the silk cords gleamed with intricate weavings,\nat the limits of thought, the *\"spider\"* still knew its doom;\nthough the golden flanks blazed with a thousand flames,\nten *li* away, the *\"centipede\"* could never match *\"Wukong’s\"* enlightenment.\n\nThe Old Mother of Li Mountain mastered the *Yinfu* (Obscure Symbols),\nspeaking of the Hundred-Eyed Demon King’s monstrous sight—\nthe pure *yin* recognition, harboring poisoned flames.\nThe *Pilao* (Pilao) nun governed *yang* energy,\nresembling the purple clouds of Thousand-Flower Cave atop *Ziyun Mountain*,\nmanifesting supreme *yang* brilliance, piercing luminous clarity.\n\nThe embroidered needle—\nneither steel, nor iron, nor gold—\nforged in the eye of *Mao* (the star).\nIlluminating natural wisdom,\nabandoning the muddled crossroads of perception.\n*\"A sound breaks the golden light,\"*\ncountless cleverness is but illusion;\n*\"Closing the eyes, feigning blindness,\"*\nwhen the sun rises, fire loses its glow.\n\nThe centipede’s *yang* poison revealed its true form—\nwhere then is the Daoist’s *\"yellow sprout\"* and *\"qi flower\"*?\n\nWisdom shatters illusion;\n*yang* subdues *yin*;\nsubtlety conceals profundity;\nvirtue eradicates evil;\none principle encompasses myriad truths;\nthe elixir dissolves poison—\nthis passage encompasses its essence.\n\nA cultivator who, at the *Mother Hen’s* abode,\nremoves the *wuqi* (centipede) from the robe,\ndeeply grasps true and false,\nand subdues the roots—\nthen all peripheral obstacles will be reduced to ashes,\nand one may attain life while perfecting nature.\n\n---\n**The Seventy-Fourth Episode**\n*Longcheng Reports the Demon’s Ruthlessness*\n*The Disciple Demonstrates Transformative Power*\n\nTreasure One said: *\"Austerities and refining bring no benefit to longevity—\nthey only hasten death; this is demonic, not Dao!\"*\nBeyond this, where else might one seek truth?\nOne must empty oneself to serve others,\nseeking a true master’s guidance.\n\nIf one boasts arrogantly or hesitates with doubt,\na monstrous obstacle will surely arise,\nblocking the path to the West.\n\nThe opening states: *\"Practicing merit, advancing in error,\"*\nwarning disciples to proceed with caution in seeking instruction,\nfinding a genuine place to go.\n\n*\"The Three Saints broke free from desire’s net,\nleaping from emotional bonds—\nas they walked forward, they saw a towering mountain,\nits peaks piercing the blue sky, truly obstructing heaven and sun.\nAn old man shouted: ‘Master of the West, halt for now!\nOn this mountain lurks a band of demons,\nwho have devoured countless mortals—\ndo not proceed!’\"*\n\nThis arose from his own arrogance,\nblindly rushing forward without seeking guidance,\nraising a treacherous peak to block the path—\na demon born of his own hubris.\n\nIt foreshadows the later revelations of *yin-yang* mysteries,\nfor without humility and self-abnegation,\none cannot penetrate deeply and instead becomes a demon.\n\nThe *Laozi* says:\n*\"Not asserting oneself, one becomes eminent;\nnot praising oneself, one achieves merit;\nnot boasting, one endures.\"*\nThe *Zuozhuan* says:\n*\"When seeking something, one must first humble oneself.\"*\nConfucius says:\n*\"Consider others below you.\"*\nThe *Dao Decalogue Stele* says:\n*\"Gentleness and weakness are the path’s crossing.\"*\nAll urge the practitioner to cultivate a yielding nature,\na humble heart seeking benefit to enter the Dao.\n\n*\"The Master said: ‘Your appearance is grotesque,\nyour speech vulgar—\nI fear you’ll offend him,\nand we’ll gain no truth.’\"*\nThis is the passage’s core lesson.\n\nThe Disciple laughed: *\"Let me change into a more refined form to ask.\"*\nHe transformed into a young novice—\ntruly able to alter his demeanor.\n\nYet phrases like *\"degrading oneself to rise\"* were still excessive.\n\nThe old man said: *\"This novice spoke too boldly—\nhe’ll never grow again.\"*\nSeeing his reckless words, he gave no reply—\narrogant speech earns no trust.\n\nEight Rules then bowed to ask,\nbegging for guidance once more.\nOnly with humility could true trust be earned.\n\nPointing to *\"Lion-Tiger Ridge, Lion-Tiger Cave,\"*\nit symbolizes obstinate, unruly *qi*—\nif the heart lacks mastery and restraint spreads unchecked,\nsouth, north, east, and west—\nall directions become demonic mouths,\nand the body becomes mere meat.\n\nThus the Disciple said: *\"I have my own plan.\"*\nThe Golden Star said: *\"Only your transformative schemes\nwill allow passage.\nIf you delay even slightly,\nthe path will prove difficult.\"*\n\nThree Sage heard these words and wished to inquire about taking another path to circumvent the obstacle—another transformative scheme—but the Disciple said, *\"You cannot turn aside.\"*\n\nAs the *Li Sao* states:\n*\"The path is long and fraught with hardships,\ndispatching many chariots to await the way.\nThe road does not bend left to turn,\nbut points toward the Western Sea as its goal.\"*\n\nIt laments the world’s tangled paths, where the straight way is unpassable.\nTo turn aside seems like a stratagem, yet abandoning the true path to speak of turning\nis like abandoning the scripture to speak of expedients,\nor abandoning the balance to speak of the hammer.\nTo reverse the scripture and distort the measure\nis not the subtle art of weighing and balancing to judge lightness and heaviness—\nthus it cannot be called an expedient.\nHence, *\"You cannot turn aside.\"*\n\nSince the Han dynasty, none have deeply understood this meaning.\nThe Immortal Master, along the journey to obtain the scriptures,\nalways pointed out the phrase *\"You cannot turn aside,\"*\nprofoundly illustrating that the true path—abandoning the yin-yang mysteries—\ndoes not allow westward passage.\nThis can be said to be one who deeply grasps both scripture and expedient.\n\nThis is the power of transformative action,\nand thus it is uniquely attributed to the Disciple.\n\nFor turning means:\nthe demon lords over me, and I flee the demon—\nyet the demon remains, and the demons in the path of turning are even more numerous.\nIf the demon remains, how can I rely on turning?\n\nThe turning that does not turn:\nI lord over the demon, and the demon submits to me—\nthe demon is already subdued, and the demons in the path of turning are already vanquished.\nWhen the demon is subdued, that is the use of turning,\nyet I do not lose the true path.\n\nThus, the great practitioner knows\nthat all external demons arise from internal demons—\nnot questioning the external, only the internal;\nnot fearing demons, only fearing myself.\n\nThe Disciple said: *\"As long as we remain mindful.\"*\n\n「“Transforming into a gnat” means:\nto reduce the great to the small,\nto refine the coarse into the subtle,\nto embody the gentle and tender state of an infant—\nyet never losing the pure, innocent heart.\n\nThe infant’s heart,\nby nature, is true knowing (*liángzhī*),\nfree from all private intent—\ndemons cannot penetrate it.\n\nEntering through the demon’s ear,\nexiting from the demon’s mouth—\nthis very act of transforming into a gnat in a single thought\nis already enough to pierce through the demon’s belly.\n\nThe heart commands fire (*xīnhuǒ*),\nyet its emptiness and luminosity remain unobscured—\nthus it is called *“the one who stokes the fire”* (*shāohuǒ de*).\nFire needs wind to spread,\nand when it rides the wind, it burns even more fiercely—\nthus it is called *“the master of the wind”* (*zǒngzhàn fēng*).\n\nThe most wondrous part lies in the *“Investigating the true and false”* section:\nunifying great and small into one,\nblending true and false into a single household—\nthis is the stroke of the divine creating ghostly illusions,\npainting words of the heart’s inner deliberation,\nnot to be taken as literal reality (*shíxiàng*).\n\nThe true heart is originally the true master of the wind (*zhēnzhuānfēng*),\nyet in the demon’s realm, it becomes false;\nThe true master of the wind is originally false heart (*jiǎxīn*),\nyet in the demon’s realm, it becomes true.\n\nUsing false to investigate the true,\nthe false can become true;\nUsing true to follow the false,\nthe true also becomes false.\n\nThus it is said:\n“When it aligns with me, it is true;\nWhen it strays even slightly, it is false.”\n\nThis is the genuine speech of the small master of the wind (*xiǎo zhuānfēng*),\nwhich is also the profound discourse of the great master of the wind (*dà zhuānfēng*).」\n\nThe demon of reckless speech stirs up martial ambition—\nits origins lie in self-forged delusion.\nThe minor demon’s warnings—\n*\"swallowing the Heavenly Host,\"*\n*\"contending with Heaven,\"*\n*\"the Peach Blossom Feast\"*—\nmirror the Journeyer’s deeds from five hundred years past.\n\nWhat the demon does, the Journeyer has done;\nthus the Journeyer says:\n*\"If it’s mere boastful talk, I’ve done worse myself.\"*\n\nYet the claim—\n*\"once swallowed ten million Heavenly Soldiers\"*—\nthough seemingly absurd,\nmerely captures the bold, exaggerated spirit.\n\nAs in Song Yu’s words:\n*\"Bent bow hung on the Fu Sang,*\n*long sword leaned against Heaven’s pillar\";*\nor *\"drinking like a great whale absorbing the hundred rivers\";*\nor Yang Da’s *\"hand plucking stars from the sky\";*\nor Wang Xizhi’s *\"brush strokes sweeping a thousand-man army\";*\nor Wen Tianxiang’s *\"southern will to prop up Kunlun,*\n*northern will to swallow the Yellow River whole\"*—\nall such speech is grand yet empty,\nwild yet ungrounded—\nthe very demon of the Dao.\n\nThe Journeyer first *\"darkly laughs,\"*\nthen *\"darkly ponders,\"*\nfinally *\"darkly startles,\"*\nthreefold reflection to curb himself.\n\nThe *\"Yin-Yang Qi Bottle\"*—\nits transformations boundless,\nits subtleties fused in profound unity.\nEncountered with crude boldness, few escape its grasp;\nmet with empty boasting, none avoid its depths.\nIts aperture is both utterly void and utterly firm—\nunless one studies it with meticulous care,\npenetrating to its core,\none will never pass through.\n\nThe Journeyer says:\n*\"Only beware the bottle itself.\"*\nTo guard against it,\none must first cultivate evenness of breath and caution in speech.\n\nThe many-mouthed are the greatest harm to the heart—\nthus to seize the cave’s demon,\none must first dispel the gate’s specter,\nscattering minor demons,\nremoving the many-mouthed.\n\nThe marvel lies in the phrase *\"Tang Seng’s flesh—no more than a few scraps\"*—\nspeaking of flavor so sparse and simple,\nso few and far between,\nthat all their clamoring is but wasted drooling.\nWhat use are the many-mouthed then?\n\nYet if one speaks grand lies to deceive,\nscattering minor demons may work—\nhow can it escape the Great Demon’s devouring?\n\nIn the seventy-fifth installment—\n*\"The Monkey’s Spirit Pierces Yin-Yang’s Aperture,\"*\n*\"The Demon Lord Returns to the True Dao\"*—\nMaster Wu Yi says:\nThis is the wondrous application of refining essence into qi,\nthe initial stage of transformation and change.\n\nOf old, Lao Dan spoke to Confucius:\n*\"Banish your arrogant qi.\"*\nFor *\"arrogant\"* is the Dao’s demon.\n\nIf one uses softness and advances with weakness,\nthen nothing rigid remains unyielding,\nnothing strong remains unweakened.\n\nI cultivate my sharp edge well—\nthe demon loses its perfect defenses,\nand the demon returns to my true self.\n\nUnless one humbles the will,\npenetrates Yin-Yang’s secrets,\nand deeply grasps the workings of creation,\none will never fathom its depths.\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"Without desire, I observe its marvel;\nwith desire, I observe its subtleties.\"*\nZhu Xi said:\n*\"Without study, do not force attack.\"*\nBoth point to the subtleties and marvels of Yin-Yang qi—\ndifficult to penetrate.\n\nLater scholars, unaware of the Dao’s essence,\nclaim *\"the heart is the Dao,\"*\nand by probing the heart with the heart,\nlose all trace of subtlety and marvel.\n\nZhang Zai said:\n*\"From qi’s transformation comes the name Dao.\"*\nThus, it is already clear that the Dao belongs to Yin-Yang,\nnot to the heart—\nthough the heart is the master of piercing its subtleties and marvels.\n\n*\"The Great Sage transforms into a tiny wind-drilling insect,\nentering the Lion’s Mane Cave\"*—\nthis is the transformation of softness and weakness,\nseeking with an empty heart.\n\n*\"Transforming into a fly\"*—\nthe ultimate of softness and weakness.\n\nStartling the old demon,\nunaware it laughs,\nits careless jest reveals its flaw—\nhow else could it be bound by the treasure bottle?\n\nThe treasure bottle unites Yin-Yang qi,\nwater and fire in primal chaos,\nencompassing spirit and vitality—\nnothing escapes its transformation.\n\nIn the human body, it is the root of the navel’s central yellow breath,\nthe alchemical *\"play of the mysterious female,\"*\nwhere spirit is condensed and the path is sealed—\nthe so-called *\"white jade linked rings.\"*\n\nCentral in position,\nit contains the seven treasures, eight trigrams, and twenty-four qi—\nnothing is excluded.\n\nThe body mirrors heaven and earth,\nand this orifice symbolizes the Supreme Ultimate—\nno duality exists.\n\nYet this, when followed correctly, becomes the marvel of human perfection;\nwhen reversed, it becomes the marvel of elixir cultivation.\n\nStudents of the Dao reach this point,\nbewildered and unable to probe—\nonly to retreat in despair.\n\nOnly by penetrating its inner workings\ndoes one realize that the alchemical method is but this—\nwith only internal and external, correct and inverted, distinctions.\n\nYet how foolish to cling to this treasure bottle,\nclaiming *\"essence begets qi, qi begets spirit,\"*\ncondensing spirit here, fixing intent to seal it—\nonly to hasten one’s own transformation!\n\nThe old demon says:\n*\"Monkey, this time you enter my treasure bottle—\nno more thoughts of the Western Path.\"*\n\nThe immortal sage’s words here awaken many spring dreams.\n*\"Sealed within the bottle\"*—\ncondensing spirit at the qi-orifice,\nthe symbol of refining essence into qi.\n*\"Closing breath, forgetting speech\"*—\nsilent and unmoving—\nstillness belongs to water;\n*\"losing voice, breaking into laughter\"*—\nstirred and responsive—\nresponsiveness belongs to fire.\n\nThus, hearing words ignites fire—\nthe principle of dynamic response in stillness.\n\n*\"Forty snakes twisted into eighty\"*—\nthe four symbols divided into eight trigrams;\n*\"three fire dragons spiraling above and below\"*—\nthe interplay of sovereign fire, ministerial fire, and common fire.\n\nAgain, three and four make seven,\ntwo and four make eight,\nthree and eight make twenty-four,\nfour and eight make thirty-two—\ncounting in cycles,\nthey still align with the bottle’s *\"seven treasures, eight trigrams, twenty-four qi,\"*\nand *\"thirty-six persons.\"*\n\n*\"Long body, short body\"*—\nall reveal that movement and stillness adapt to the body,\nyet one cannot perceive its subtleties to escape.\n\nTo cling here and seek transcendence—\nthis is to grasp a named form\nwhile hoping for the origin of the nameless—\nis it not self-deception?\n\nThe Journeyer says:\n*\"Who would have thought today I’d fall into this,\nlosing my very life?\nIt must be my past name\nthat brings this present calamity.\"*\n\nRecalling the Bodhisattva’s transmission of the three-hair saving thread,\nhe returns to true truth.\n\nThrough transformation and study,\nhe pierces the heavens’ secrets,\nopens the Bodhisattva’s law-eye,\nreveals Yin-Yang’s hidden marvels,\nshatters doubt,\nescapes the fire-pit—\nthe true Dao of transcending birth and death!\n\n*\"Transforming into a cicada,\ntemporarily perching on a branch,\nwandering atop the demon’s head;\nsetting down the cup,*\nsuddenly astonished to find the bottle empty—\nhow could one not cry out in shattering the pot!\"\n\n*\"Empty\"*—also *\"control\"*—\nlaboring in vain, boiling an empty pot with water and fire;\n*\"searching\"*—also *\"fleeing\"*—\nseeking a hollow cave in vain.\n\nAlas!\n*\"The bottle is pierced—\nno one can be sealed within.\"*\nLike the body’s true yang already dissipated,\nno elixir remains—\nancients likened it to *\"breaking the forked sack.\"*\nThis is the meaning.\n\nStudying to this point,\nthe Dao-heart manifests itself,\nthe demon’s audacity falters.\n\nTrue essence refines into true qi,\ntrue qi transforms into the body—\nenlightenment dawns on true emptiness,\neverywhere is the Dao.\n\nWhere the demon’s blade falls,\nI become—\nI, the demon’s manifestation,\nsplit into two, yet still two selves—\nthough countless billions of bodies,\nthey are all still me;\n\nI head meets—it becomes true,\nTrue—*the original body of the demon*,\nclasped to my form—\nstill, one and the same.\nThough countless billions of demons,\nthey are all still true.\n\nOne becomes two, two becomes one—\nthus the demon reveals its original form to devour the true self,\nI am the true demon;\nI enter the demon’s belly, subduing its head,\nI am demon of the demon.\n\n*\"Stay through winter, reach Qingming\"*—\nsymbolizing the ebb and flow of yin-yang *qi*;\n*\"Practice inhalation-exhalation, sneeze\"*—\nillustrating the false actions of mouth and nose.\n*\"Take the medicine elixir, trumpet-mouth\"*—\nsoon the peach-blossom face glows red;\n*\"Scatter the wine-qi, somersault\"*—\nonly then is the treasure hidden in the *utpala* belly revealed.\n\nAh!\n*Transform qi!* *Transform qi!*\nHow shall it emerge?\nThis must have a method.\n\n*\"When Old Monkey thrusts his *jin-gu* staff into his crown—\na hole is pierced:\nfirst as a sky-light,\nsecond as a smoke-chute.\"*\nIs this not the supreme method for *qi* to exit?\n\nThose who expound the Dao reveal the heavens’ secrets to this point—\ntruly, they know deeply and speak exhaustively.\n\nDivine!\nWondrous!\n\n「Yet this is but the *true* understanding of the *Way*’s core, but the practitioner has not yet attained its *true* subtlety—thus it is the *\"initial vehicle\"* (初乘).\n\n**Chapter 76: *Heart-Mind Dwells, Demon Returns to Its True Nature* (心神居舍魔归性)**\n*Wood-Mother’s* descent betrays the demon’s true form (木母同降怪体真).\n*The Awakened One* said: This reveals the profound art of refining *qi* and transforming *spirit*—the *\"middle vehicle\"* (中乘) of Daoist practice and change.\n\n*The Zhuangzi* teaches: *\"When the mind’s intent is undivided, it coalesces into *spirit*.\"* (用志不分，乃凝于神。)\n*The Master* said: *\"The heart is the sovereign of *qi*; *qi* is the root of *spirit*; *spirit* is the very *nature* itself. The form is the dwelling of *qi*; *spirit* is the essence of the form; *qi* is the vital *command*.\"* (心者气之主，气者神之根，神即性也；形者气之舍，神者形之精，气即命也。)\nIndeed, refining the *form* (形) allows the *essence* (精) to transform *qi*; when *qi* gathers, it transmutes into *spirit*; when *spirit* is concentrated at the *qi*’s aperture (气穴), *qi* grows ever more potent, and *spirit* becomes ever more luminous (灵).\nYet this *essence* is not the *yin* essence of copulation (交感精), this *qi* is not the breath of respiration (呼吸气), this *spirit* is not the restless mind of deliberation (思虑神).\nAs *Duzijian* (督子) says: *\"From the void it arises, not in heart or kidney, but in the *Xuanmen* aperture alone.\"* (从虚无中来，不在心肾，而在于玄关一窍。)\nScholars who fail to grasp *yin-yang* merely grope at their own bodies, mistaking the *manifest* and *luminous* cognition (昭昭灵灵之识神) for true attainment—thus they wander far astray.\n\nIn the text: *\"The Old Demon roars, ‘Great Compassionate, Great Merciful Sage of Equal Heavenly Rank!’\"* (老魔叫一声：‘大慈大悲齐天大圣菩萨！ ’)\nCalling *\"Great\"* (大) repeatedly, he seeks *command* (命) through the *one* (人) within.\n*The Pilgrim* replies: *\"Shorten it by a few characters—just call ‘Old Monkey’s grandfather, Sun Wukong.’\"* (行者道：‘省几个字儿，只叫孙外公果。 ’)\nThe Old Demon, thus addressed, truly calls out: *\"Grandfather! Grandfather!\"*\nThis shows that recognizing the *external* and *internal* dualities (外来二八厶厶) is the true way to borrow *command*.\n\nWhy send him out with a *single-vehicle* bamboo litter (一乘香藤轿)?\nIt signifies that only this *single-vehicle* method is genuine—all others are false.\n\n*\"The Pilgrim acts within the Demon’s belly\"*—\nhis *heart-mind* (心神) dwells and refines, calming the *internal* to secure the *external*.\n*\"He binds his heart-liver with a single thread\"*—\nplacing it in one fixed point, holding the *commercial* (商) to govern the *excessive* (多).\n*\"Then he shrinks his body, facing the Demon’s steel fangs and sharp blades\"*—\ncontrolling his *form* (形) and *spirit* (魄), using the *small* to subdue the *great*, the *yielding* to overcome the *unyielding*.\n*\"With a sneeze, the Pilgrim bursts forth—seeing the wind, he grows three zhang tall\"*—\nrefining *qi* (气) reveals the *original spirit* (元神).\n*\"Severing the outer, the inner feels distress\"*—\n*internal* and *external* are one; *emotion* (情) does not part from *nature* (性)—this is not a clear-cut severance.\n\n*\"The Three Demons fall together, bowing their heads; the host of demons retreat, all returning to their caves\"*—\nthis is the refining of *qi* and transforming of *spirit*, where the demon submits to its true *nature*.\n\nYet even at this stage, though the *yang spirit* (阳神) appears, the *yin qi* (阴气) has not yet integrated with *my* (我) *qi* as one—so the demon remains, like a traveler still midway.\n\nIn the text: *\"The Master and Disciple pack their belongings and horses, waiting along the road\"*—\nand at its end: *\"The Demon and monsters, united in heart and intent, march west for another four hundred li\"*—\nmerely illustrating the midpoint of their journey.\n\nThe practitioner must now diligently apply *fire cultivation* (火功), proceed with utmost caution, lest he falter—\nfor if *yin qi* is not subdued, it will encroach upon the *original spirit*, when will he transcend?\n\n*\"The False Descents of the Two Demons\"*—\n*yin qi* not yet mastered.\n*\"The Three Demons’ ‘Separate the Tiger from the Mountain’\"*—\n*yin qi* not yet mastered.\n*\"The Thirty Monsters, arranging tea and meals, hosting the Tang Monk\"*—\nthe lingering of *yin qi*.\n*\"The Sixteen Ghosts, in turn shouting orders, replacing the litter-bearers\"*—\nthe harassment of *yin qi*.\n\n*\"Beholding the city’s malevolent *qi*\"*—\nthe obstruction of *yin qi*.\n*\"Each harbors wrathful *qi*—thunderous clashes erupt; the Three Monks and Three Demons battle to the death\"*—\n*yin qi* and *yang spirit* intermingle, locked in struggle.\n*\"They bear the Tang Monk aloft, silence their banners and drums; the monsters swirl around him, the Elder sinks into a stupor\"*—\n*yin qi* overwhelms in its vast, desolate power, and the true *yang* is once more submerged.\n\nTracing the root of this failure:\n*Wood-Mother* indulged in private schemes, while *fire cultivation* was weak.\n*\"At the slightest provocation, he scatters *fire*\"*—\n*fire cultivation* is weak.\n*\"He hoards his private stores\"*—\n*Wood-Mother* indulges in private schemes.\nOnly because of this weakness, he suffered defeat in battle—*fire* was exhausted by *earth*.\nOnly because of this indulgence, he was terrified into feigning submission—*wood* was overwhelmed by *water*.\n\nThus, the translation concludes.\n\nThe Dao of seeking the scriptures forbids complacency and sloth, demanding instead steadfast and arduous effort. The Pilgrim says: *\"Let him endure some hardship, that he may know the difficulty of seeking the scriptures.\"*\n\nKnowing that the quest cannot do without the *Wood-Mother*, yet that the monstrous forms must be subdued through mutual descent—when *metal* and *wood* harmonize, the male leads while the female follows, as brothers in affection, the elder and younger in accord. *\"The Pilgrim obeys Eight Rules and strikes through the elephant’s trunk, while Eight Rules obeys the Pilgrim and beats the elephant’s hide. Two elephant powers, together subduing the monsters.\"* Is this not the true spirits uniting their strength, the true monsters manifesting their forms?\n\nThus, the guiding principle states:\n*\"The mind-spirit dwells in the demon’s nature, the Wood-Mother descends with the monster’s true form.\"*\n\nIn the seventy-seventh chapter—*Group Demons Mock True Nature, One Body Pays Homage to True Suchness*—Master Yu says: This is the wondrous application of refining the spirit back to emptiness, the supreme technique of transformation and action. Subduing the Lion’s heart earned the first stage; subduing the Elephant’s nature earned the middle stage; subduing the Peng’s *qi* earned the highest stage. When the Great Suchness Dao arrives, though it is said the mind-spirit dwells in the demon’s nature, the spirit and *qi* have not yet merged into undivided oneness, returning to the Great Void—then this mind-nature remains entangled in existence and cannot transcend the mundane. Thus, the Great Peng was not subdued in *qi*, and the Lion and Elephant followed suit—*\"the group demons mock the true nature.\"*\n\nThe Master said: *\"Subduing qi does not serve qi; serving qi requires subduing qi. Serving qi does not bring longevity; longevity requires subduing qi.\"* The Peng does not yield to *qi*, for it follows the true *yin* *qi*, roaming freely through heaven and earth without submission, making the demon’s influence vast. *\"Lion\"* symbolizes the mind, belonging to *fire*, prone to suspicion, hence its green hue. Fire not yet ignited but smoke arising—*fire* combined with *wood*—it is the leader of cultivation, the foundation of the Dao’s practice, hence called the Old Demon. Its domain is named *\"Lion’s Ridge, Lion’s Cave.\"*\n\n*\"Elephant\"* symbolizes nature, belonging to *earth*, generating *metal*, hence its white hue. It rests upon the body and resides in the west, *earth* combined with *metal*—it is the mighty strength bearing the Dao, the luminous essence embodying the Dao, hence called the Second Demon. To subdue these two demons is to attain the Two Vehicles, the wondrous application of cultivating nature.\n\nThe Great Peng is the *kun* of the Northern Sea in *Zhuangzi*, transforming into the Peng, soaring ninety thousand *li* southward. The Northern Sea is water—*\"uttermost yin, solemn and austere, yet within it lies yang.\"* The *kun* in water is *yang*; transforming into the Peng, soaring ninety thousand *li* southward, it reaches the extreme of *yang* in its ninefold power. Thus, *\"uttermost yang, blazing beneath the Great Brightness above.\"* The Peng belongs to the Phoenix, the Vermilion Bird of the South. The *Shi Han Ji* says: *\"The Vermilion Bird blazes through the void descending,\"* akin to the *Dan Jing*’s *\"Crimson Phoenix,\"* both referring to true *yang qi* and the wondrous application of nurturing life.\n\nThose who read *Nan Hua* know it as self-expression but fail to grasp that it expounds the essential mysteries of the Great Dao thus. At the end, the Buddha speaks of *\"Chaos first dividing, heaven opening, earth forming, all things born. The Phoenix obtains the harmonizing qi, nurturing the孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀孔雀\n\nThe opening lines—*\"The Old Demon devours the Eight Precepts,\"* where Wood and Fire are ensnared by Wood and Fire demons; *\"The Two Demons drag away Sha Zeng,\"* where Earth and Metal are ensnared by Earth and Metal demons; *\"The Three Demons strike down the Pilgrim,\"* where Water and Metal are ensnared by Water and Metal demons—\n\nWhen bound together, their failure to subdue and unify into oneness reveals that their very nature is demonic, deceiving their own true nature.\n\n*\"One wing spanning nine ten-thousands\"*—this is the meaning of *\"Peng lofts nine ten-thousands,\"* as previously explained.\n\nYet in the ninety-ninth chapter, when detailing the inner trials, the *\"Monster’s threefold hue\"* is revealed as the *\"Sixty-Two Trials,\"* where the Peng-Monster is crimson and gold-winged, stirring the Northern and Southern Seas, blending the hues of Lion and Elephant into the primordial *Wu Xing* true *Yi* qi—neither manifesting its color nor confining itself to a single name, thus its grandeur.\n\nThe Dao of transcendence demands mastery over this qi. If one fixates solely on the mind-nature as ultimate truth, then the very *hou tian* qi of our body falls under its devouring, cyclical, and ceaselessly digesting grasp—never able to uproot itself from its cage.\n\nThe Sun-Wukong of old, in his boastful defiance, declares:\n*\"My mighty lord can swallow ten ten-thousands of celestial soldiers in one gulp.\"*\n*\"My lord desires to challenge Heaven.\"*\n*\"Five hundred years ago, he devoured the Lion-Elephant Kingdom and seized its realm.\"*\nThis already foreshadows the meaning above.\n\n*\"The Old Fiend praised his strength and cunning, ordering the minor demons to fetch water, stir the pot, and haul out the iron cage to steam the monk and scatter them each to their own fate.\"*\n*\"Bound within the cage, he shall surely not escape.\"*\nThe lesser demons took turns stoking the fire, awaiting the moment when the monk’s vital essence would be consumed.\n\nThis speaks of how one cannot break free from the ceaselessly rotating *Wu Xing* steaming-qi, and how his bones and flesh must inevitably dissolve.\n\n*\"The Elder cried to the Pilgrim, ‘How shall we save our lives?’ The two monks wept in unison.\"*\nThis laments that all are unaware of the *Dao* of escape.\n\n*\"The Pilgrim laughed, ‘Master, fear not. Brothers, cease your tears. Whatever he may do, I shall suffer no harm.’ He then gathered his spirit, leapt into the air, and vanished from sight.\"*\n\nThe words speak of spirit and enlightenment, for it lies within the person. If one seeks to escape the cycle of life and death, there exists a method of leaping beyond the body.\n\nHuman existence within the *Wu Xing* is like being trapped in an iron cage, subjected to steaming—when the fire reaches its peak, none escape unscathed, their flesh rotting and bones dissolving. Thus, death is as inevitable as night follows day, with none spared.\n\nThe *Dao* of escape begins with subduing desires through *fùlóng* (伏龙, \"Suppressed Dragon\")—quelling passions as one draws fuel from beneath the cauldron, preventing the flames from surging. The Great Sage dispatched the Northern Sea Dragon to guard beneath the pot, drawing fuel as *fùlóng* does.\n\nNext, it lies in cultivating virtue through precepts to soothe the mind, opening a boundless and uninhibited spirit, so that *qi* does not stagnate. The Eight Rules [Precepts] spoke of \"stifled *qi*\" and \"releasing *qi*,\" for when the Pilgrim sealed the pot, the Eight Rules declared, *\"Tonight, death is certain.\"*\n\nThe Elder wept bitterly, revealing how stifled *qi* becomes a demon—most pitiable of afflictions. The Eight Rules exclaimed:\n*\"Hark! O fire-tender, why add more fuel? You’ve sealed your own fate!\"*\nTruly wondrous!\n\nThe **Tianpeng** found himself trapped in the iron cage’s cruel fate, yet at the moment of dire peril, he lounged about with carefree ease, as though playing at leisure. Knowing he looked down upon all things, insufficient to be a demon, what was the breadth of his heart?\n\nThus, the fire-tending minor demon dozed and slept soundly.\n\nWhen the Pilgrim revealed himself to save, the Eight Rules said:\n*\"Escape must mean breaking free from the cage’s roots—\ndo not again let it steam you!\"*\n\nHe meant that to evade the Five Elements’ [五行] suffocating *qi* was to break free from the cage’s roots,\nwhile to be unable to evade the Five Elements’ suffocating *qi* was to be trapped again within its steam.\n\nIf a cultivator cannot transcend the mundane and escape the cycle of existence,\nthough his virtue and conduct may be flawless,\nhe remains bound within rebirth,\nhis ordinary essence still rooted—\nhow could he avoid the fate of being recaptured and steamed once more?\n\nTherefore, the Pilgrim declared:\n*\"If my master is no more than an ordinary being,\nwe three will leave anyway, no matter what.\"*\n\nYet this path of breaking free from the cage’s roots and escaping the world\nis the grand liberation—\nsplitting apart the primordial chaos and piercing through the formless void,\nnot the petty tricks of ignoring discipline,\nor scheming to climb walls.\n\nWhen master and disciple climbed the wall,\nthe demon suddenly awoke,\nseizing them all—\nthey were bound to be recaptured and steamed again.\nEven if they did not wrong others,\nhow could they benefit themselves?\n\nBut how did they not face recapture and steaming?\nHow did the demon cling to the Tang Monk, refusing to let him go,\nand thrust him into the **Jinxin Iron Chest** [锦香铁柜],\nplanning to devour him alive?\n\nIt was because he knew that all worldly shortcuts and minor arts\nare but schemes to climb walls—\nthey inevitably lead to being locked in the chest.\n\nAlas! Most mortals fall prey to the demon’s cruel jaws of life’s torment,\nyet even the Tang Monk is no exception.\nWhen the Great Sage hears this, how could his heart not be torn like a knife,\nhis tears not surge like a spring, and his voice not burst in great lamentation?\nHe says:\n*\"Strive to practice and refine the demon together,\"*\n*\"Yet when the qi scatters and the heart is wounded, what can be done?\"*\nThis is the great weeping!\n\nThus, he weeps for all beings now in this moment of distressed reflection,\nof diligent cultivation and growth.\nHe manifests his form and devises a method,\nurgently turning back to sweep away the Lion-Demons’ Den\nand awaken with fierce resolve,\nseeing the Tathāgata recite the *Songgu Caṣṭra*,\nto achieve transcendence.\n\nLook—\n*\"Directly ascending the Spirit Mountain,\"*\n*\"Roaring like thunder!\"*\nHow bold and diligent is his progress!\n\nThe Tathāgata points to the old demon’s two monstrous disciples,\ndeclaring that the Great Phoenix is born from the Azure Dapeng,\nand shares the same mother—孔雀—as the Peacock,\nboth being the very *Dharma-mothers* of compassion and mercy.\nWhen the Peacock first emerged,\nit swallowed a man in a single breath—\neven the Tathāgata was swallowed whole,\nmeaning *\"one mouth can devour ten million heavenly warriors.\"*\nYet the Tathāgata had already cultivated his *Jianliu Jīnshēn*—*\na golden body of six feet.\nThus, he could enter the demon’s mouth and split its back.\n\nThe Tang Monk had not yet attained the golden body,\nand risked being swallowed by the demon’s jaws,\nunable to transcend.\nTherefore, he must subdue this demon\nbefore he can achieve the *Jianliu Jīnshēn*—\na golden body of six feet.\n\nSo, all demons that bind me, steam me, swallow me, or lock me in their chests,\ndo so out of their love, their nurturing, their molding, and their creation—\nnot only do they harbor great grudges,\nbut they also bestow great kindness.\n\n孔雀 and 大鹏,\nboth embodying boundless compassion and mercy,\nare truly *Dharma-mothers*—\nwhat more could one doubt?\n\nLater generations, seeing the Peacock enshrined as a *Dharma-mother*,\ntake offense at the Buddha’s teachings on impartiality toward kin,\nyet they fail to grasp Mencius’ words:\n*\"To cultivate one’s heart and endure with steadfastness,\none must first experience hardship and suffering.\"*\n\nNor do they recognize that the Great Phoenix symbolizes the *Zhenyi*—\nthe primordial *qi* of true essence,\nwhich is indeed the mother of all who become immortals, Buddhas, or sages.\n\n*\"Fine pearls sink to the ocean’s depths,\nhard gold is refined in raging flames—*\nthe most genuine truths emerge from great demons,\nand those who penetrate to their core\nare never won without peril and risk.*\n\nIf one seeks the Dao without first facing the Great Phoenix\nand subduing it with bold resolve,\nthey will never become an immortal or a Buddha—\nan unalterable truth.\n\n*\"The Tathāgata summoned Manjushri and Samantabhadra to the Lion-Demons’ country,\ncommanding the Pilgrim to battle the monsters,\nluring them before the Buddha’s presence.\nThe monsters, seeing the past, future, and present Triple World-honored images,\nas well as the Arhat and *Keshin*,\nrecognized the protagonist.\"*\n\nNot recognizing the protagonist as the heart—\nwhy so?\n*\"The past heart cannot be obtained;\nthe future heart cannot be obtained;\nthe present heart cannot be obtained.\"*\nThe Lion and Elephant demons,\nbeing demons of heart-nature,\nfail to recognize the true heart-nature—\nthis is the victory of the true heart.\n\nReturning to the authentic form,\nthe ears vanish and the reliance is extinguished—\nthe heart-nature merges with the primordial *qi*.\n\n*\"Only the three demons refused to submit,\nrising straight into the heavens.\nThe Tathāgata raised his hand and pointed upward—\nthe monsters could not fly away,\nremaining only on the Buddha’s crown,\nwhere they revealed their true forms:\na Great Phoenix with golden wings.\"*\n\nThis one,\nthe very essence of a single grain of golden elixir—\nthe *Zhenyi qi*,\nwhich the Tathāgata has plainly shown how to subdue.\n\n*\"To the Tathāgata, they cried:\n‘How dare you use the Great Dao’s power to bind me!’\"*\nThe Great Dao’s power,\nthe Buddha’s true and direct teaching,\ncannot be openly revealed—\nit is transmitted outside the scriptures.\n\n*\"To escape difficulty, one must only take refuge.\"*\n*\"The Buddha’s ancestors dare not loosen their grip,\nonly commanding me to serve as a guardian in the radiant flames.\"*\nThis is *\"obtaining one, all things are complete.\"*\nRefining the spirit and returning to emptiness,\nthe supreme path of severing roots and salvation.\n\nYet one must first awaken great courage and firm resolve\nto subdue this demon.\n\nThe Great Phoenix declares:\n*\"Monkey! You’ve gone too far in tormenting me!\"*\nHis cruelty is the very seat of compassion—\nthe one who can apply the true Dao.\n\nUnable to apply the true Dao,\none becomes a demon of the Lion, Elephant, or Phoenix—\na host of demons.\nAble to apply the true Dao,\none becomes the Lion’s truth, the Elephant’s truth, the Phoenix’s truth—\na unified whole.\n\nThe Pilgrim realizes the Tathāgata’s method of subduing demons,\nthe *Shāmen* strikes the iron chest with a single rod,\nsaving the monk and setting them on their way—\nthis is the resolve of a true practitioner,\nunyielding even in a hundred setbacks.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"The true scripture must be taken by the true person,\nwhile demons, though myriad in form, are all but illusions.\"*\n\n**Chapter 78**\nThe *Bīqú* [比丘] pities his son and dispatches a shadow spirit,\nThe *Jīndiàn* [金殿] recognizes the demon and discusses Daoist morality.\n\nThe *Wùyīzǐ* [悟一子] says:\nThe *Dàodé* [道德]’s Five Thousand Words\ncenter on *\"obtaining one, all things are complete.\"*\n\n*\"One\"* refers to the primordial *Zhenyi qi*—\nthe essence that generates heaven, earth, and all beings.\nAs the primordial *qi* gives birth to the fruit of *Hòutiān*—\nthe post-heavenly realm,\nso too does the fruit contain *rén*—\nthe virtue of primordial harmony.\nThe post-heavenly *rén*,\nthe very presence of the primordial *qi*,\nis possessed by all—\nnear and intimate.\n\nIf one attains *rén*,\nthen the life-force remains and branches flourish naturally—\nthe matter of longevity is already accomplished.\n\n*\"Rén\"* mirrors *\"two\"* and *\"person\"* [人],\nembodying the marvel of yin and yang merging in virtue—\nnot something a single person can fully achieve through solitary cultivation.\n\nThe *Yì* [易] says:\n*\"One yin and one yang constitute the Dao.\"*\nMencius says:\n*\"Rén is the very nature of being human.\nTogether, they form the Dao.\"*\n\nLater scholars fail to grasp the true meaning of *Dàodé*,\nmisunderstanding the profound uses of *Kǎn* [坎] and *Lí* [离].\nThey err and fabricate false theories,\neven claiming that *\"harnessing yin to supplement yang\"* is a cure for bodily ailments,\nleading the blind to guide the blind—\nlike feeding arsenic to the hungry,\nor carrying ice to ward off the cold—\ninevitably harming life and shortening years.\nThis is to abandon the utmost *rén* and practice the greatest *bùrén*—\nunrighteousness.\n\nAh, the great error! The great error!\nThe Immortal Master, in His boundless compassion,\nused the metaphor of the *\"goose-cage\"* for the innocent—\n*\"Goose\"* is a mispronunciation—\nto show how the ignorant are ensnared in cruel bondage,\nas though one were to place a helpless infant upon the slaughter’s block.\n\nExamine its origin:\nAll stems from the *heart-sovereign’s* [心君] delusion,\nbewitched by false and perverse teachings.\nThus, the text repeatedly speaks of *\"the dim-witted ruler\"* [昏君],\nto reveal its meaning.\n\nEvery person possesses the *innocent’s heart* [赤子之心],\nrooted in boundless compassion and mercy—\nyet now, misled and confined,\nthey perish in ignorance.\nWhat was once plainly called *\"Bhikṣu’s Realm\"* [比丘国]\nhas now been twisted into *\"City of the Little Ones\"* [小子城].\n\nWhen the disciples see the goose-cage and pause in doubt,\nthey inquire at the *Golden Pavilion Inn* of the *drystation officer* [驿丞],\nasking why such a cage exists—\nsuspecting he may lack the ways of nurturing life.\n\nThe officer replies:\n*\"Heaven tolerates no second sun, nor does humanity two principles.\nTo rear a child—\nnine months in the womb, then born—\nthree years of milk and care,\ngradually forming body and form—\nhow could one not know this truth?\"*\n\nYet they *know* the way of birth arises from the natural *Dao* of Heaven and humanity,\nyet forcefully contrive and brutalize life to such extremes,\nclaiming this holds some *Dao*—\nI know not what *Dao* they speak of!\nThus it is called *\"the affair of no-Dao\"* [无道之事].\n\nThey speak of:\n*\"Daoists offering maidens,\nkings indulging in favored consorts,\nnight and day lost in lust,\nuntil their bodies wither and their lives hang by a thread;\ngathering herbs complete,\nusing the hearts and livers of one thousand one hundred and eleven children as medicine,\nso that, upon ingestion, one gains the power of eternal youth—\na rumor called *City of the Little Ones*\" [小子城].*\n\nHow erroneous!

could one rashly act to end such a life?\n\nThe White Deer reveals its true form,\nand pounces to slay the White Fox Demoness.\n*“Together, we return to the Bhikṣu [monk], manifesting our forms and transforming into mortals,”*\nsignifying the Sage’s intent:\nto split open the belly, gouge out the heart,\nand deliver a sermon in person.\nThe Great Sage then addresses the king with a smile:\n*“This is your Prime Minister,\nand this is your Queen.”*\nHis words strike home with piercing clarity—\nhow could one not be moved to sweat and shiver in dread!\n\nThe king, ashamed and grateful,\nwith the heart of an ignorant child,\nsuddenly awakens to remorse and confession,\nthus declaring:\n*“You have saved a king’s son—\nthis is true Heaven’s mercy!”*\n\nThe Longevity Star explains:\n*“I was playing chess with the Eastern Peak Emperor—\nthe game was not yet finished\nwhen I went to find him.”*\n\nThe Longevity Star says:\n*“If you return late,\nthis beast will be no more.”*\nAnd again:\n*“I wish to teach you the way of cultivation,\nbut you are already weak in sinew and spirit,\nunable to refine the elixir.\nOnly these three dates remain—\nthey were gifts to the Eastern Peak Emperor for tea,\nnow I give them to you.”*\nThis passage, which readers might see as mere concluding words,\nis in fact the immortal’s urgent admonition at parting,\nurging one to hasten cultivation.\n\nLife’s time is fleeting,\nworldly affairs like a chess game—\none must cultivate with haste,\nnever delay.\nDo not wait until your sinews weaken and your spirit fails,\nfor then you cannot refine the elixir.\n\nThe “three dates” symbolize:\none, restraining early desires;\ntwo, seeking guidance from a teacher early;\nthree, beginning practice early.\nThe Master of Upper Yang declared:\n*“Common mortals from seventy to a hundred and twenty years old\ncan all refine the elixir,”*\nencouraging those who are frail in old age.\nBut here it says:\n*“Weak in sinew and spirit,\nunable to refine the elixir,”*\nwarning those who do not exert themselves in youth.\nThis is also the meaning of Confucius’ words:\n*“At forty or fifty, one is still not to be feared,”*\nnot truly implying that a weak body cannot attain the elixir.\n\nThe king pleads for instruction,\nand the Sage replies:\n*“From now on, curb your lust for desire,\naccumulate your hidden merit—\nall worldly matters will then lengthen your deficiencies,\nsufficient to dispel illness and prolong life.”*\nThough the elixir’s method may not be spoken of,\nthe teaching of lengthening deficiencies is never abandoned.\n\n*“As they leave the city,\nsuddenly they hear a gust of wind from midair,\nand on both sides descend a thousand, one hundred, and ten-one egg baskets—\neach household comes forward,\nrecognizing their children inside,\njoyous and delighted,\nleaping and laughing,\nwithout distinction of age or gender,\nmale or female alike,\ncrowding the master and disciple back into the city.”*\n\nSeeing the compassionate heart of the Sage,\nall beings are united as one—\nno distinction between great and small.\nOnce lost in delusion for long,\nnow awakened in a single day,\nthey return as if descending from the sky—\neach reclaims their child,\nno longer ensnared by harm.\nWhat joy like this!\n\nThis is the verse:\n*“Hidden merit saves a thousand lives,\nthe child’s city remains—\nthe Bhikṣu [monk] still prevails.”*\n\nYet, if the heart holds no medicine,\nand one practices the Way of the World,\nwhere should they seek the roots and sprouts?\nThus, the immortal teacher urgently reveals the next section’s teachings.\n\n**The 80th Episode:**\n*The Fair Maiden Nurtures Yang to Seek a Mate,*\n*The Monkey-King Guards His Master and Discerns Demons.*\n\nThe Sage of Awakening says:\n*“This chapter, up to the 82nd,\nclearly states that cultivators must step by step guard their original nature,\nreturning to their innate purity.\nEven a single misstep\nwill plunge them into bottomless emptiness,\nmaking liberation difficult.*\n\nAt the chapter’s beginning,\nthe Sage cites an ancient saying:\n*“If you seek temporal wealth and honor,\nyou must exert the effort of transcending death.”*\nThe Sand Monk says:\n*“If you persist in the effort,\nthere will surely come a day of attainment.”*\nMeaning: one must never slacken for a moment.\n\nIn the previous chapter,\ndesire was led astray by external allurements,\nbut if one can fiercely reflect and return,\nit is still easier to restrain.\nNow, it is made clear:\ndesire arises from the heavens,\nthoughts spring from within—\nthese are the hardest to suppress.\n\nThe term *“fair maiden”* (姹女)\nrefers to the utmost essence of the *Kān* [Water] trigram;\n*“nurturing yang”* (育阳)\nis the yang cultivated within the *Kān* trigram.\n*Kān* represents male,\nso why is it called female?\nBecause its outer form is yin-like.\nPost-heaven yang is nurtured within the center.”\n\nWhen the affairs of men are in tumult,\nremain ever still and unmoved;\nWhen the heavens decree a tranquil gathering,\nyou must rise and manifest yourself.\n\nFor the marvel of yin and yang,\ncycles endlessly without cease,\nits utmost subtlety lies at the juncture of *Kūn* [Earth] and *Fù* [Return],\nbetween motion and stillness—\nthis is the moment of *hài* [Pig]’s end and *zǐ* [Water]’s beginning.\n\nQu Yuan’s *\"Far Roaming\"* chapter states:\n*\"The vital breath is all-pervading and divine,\nWithin it, the night abides;\nEmpty and receptive, I await it,\nTaking no action before its will.\"*\n\nZhu Xi comments:\n*\"This is what Guangchengzi taught the Yellow Emperor—\nnothing more than this.\"*\n\nDao cultivators, if they can preserve emptiness and await,\nthen countering and restraining it—\nthat is divine;\nIf they cannot preserve emptiness and await,\nbut instead comply and indulge—\nthat is monstrous.\n\nHere lies the critical threshold of life and death,\nmost worthy of discernment and vigilance.\n\n*\"The master and disciples were just conversing leisurely,\nwhen they saw another stretch of dark pine forest.\nThe Sand Monk said: ‘We have just passed the rugged mountain paths—\nhow have we come upon this dense black pine grove?\nThis must be intentional.’*\nHe further said:\n‘Disciples, throughout our journey westward,\ncountless mountains and forests have been treacherous.\nFortunately, we have reached this tranquil and refined place.’\"*\n\nThis grove contains strange and wondrous flowers and plants,\npleasing to the heart’s affection!\nI wish to rest here awhile.”\n\nBut to sit beneath the black pines—\nis that not merely to sit beneath the black pines?\nThe black pines’ shade, the black resting **qi**—\nthis is the **Dao**-manifestation of motion reaching its peak and seeking stillness.\n\nAt the moment of stillness, when one sits with closed eyes,\nsuddenly movement arises within the quiet—\nand then the monstrous and evil **Dao** is born.\nIn the text, *\"suddenly see\"* and *\"suddenly hear\"*—\nthese are profound mysteries.\n\n*\"Only then did I see a beautiful woman bound to a great tree,\nher upper half tied with rope to the branches above,\nher lower half buried in the earth below.\"*\n\nThis woman is the **yang** essence of the *Kan* hexagram,\nat the hour of *Hai*, when it descends from heaven to stir.\n*Hai* belongs to **Wood**, hence her upper half is bound to the tree.\n*Hai* passes to *Zi*, the hour of **Mouse** essence—\n*Zi* belongs to **Metal**, hence she is the **Mouse** essence.\n*Zi* ends and gives way to *Chou*, which belongs to **Earth**,\nhence her lower half is buried in the soil.\n\nThe common man sees this as ordinary,\ncomplies and follows suit—\nseeking partners in every direction.\n\nThe **Dao** cultivator sees it as strange,\ncountering and restraining it—\nfearing and guarding against its influence.\n\nThe immortal master then pointed directly and said, *\"Ah! This fellow is clearly a demon—how strange! The venerable elder, with his ordinary mortal eyes, does not recognize it.\"*\n\nUpon seeing it, one could not help but feel stirred, *\"unable to restrain oneself.\"* The moment a thought of suppression arises, another thought of desire sprouts—pitying and cherishing, lingering along the path. Alas! Alas! *\"The practitioner from the side coldly laughs,\"* piercing through the demonic deceit, admonishing and restraining, relying entirely on this steadfast and tranquil mind.\n\n*\"Suddenly, they arrived at the Zenhai Temple, and once again heard a bell toll.\"* From the stirring of desire, another thought emerges—like a bronze bell struck, one awakens abruptly, realizing the boundless ocean of craving. Then, suddenly, the unyielding strength of true gold arises, severing and subduing it with resolve.\n\nBut why does the bell, though struck on earth, have its upper half like snow and its lower half like indigo? It is said: *\"Bronze does not change its sound from external assaults; a man must not lose his resolve from the ungovernable desires of the world.\"* The Tripitaka Master stroked the bell and sighed, while the Dao cultivator picked up a stone and struck it—both employing the same principle.\n\nUpon entering the temple, they saw *\"the front in disarray, the rear in perfect order.\"* The *\"Zen\"* here refers to true gold. This steadfast mind, like true gold unchanging, though the front may be in disarray, the rear remains in perfect order—what is there to fear?\n\nYet this *\"nurturing\"* is but the cultivation of **yang qi**; this *\"seeking\"* is but the search for a partner; this *\"protecting\"* is but the safeguarding of the self. All lead to the profound and wondrous words of the next section.\n\n**Chapter 81: The Mind-Monkey at Zenhai Temple Discerns the Demon; The Three Disciples Seek Master in the Black Pine Forest**\n\nSun Wukong said, *\"This radiant form easily moves one—most difficult to restrain. Fools admire it and lose their lives, while the Sage encounters it and awakens to the True. Only if one sees clearly, knows it for a demon, and resolutely avoids it, can one wield the wisdom-sword, can one be true gold steadfast as Zenhai. If one fails to discern it truly, even a slight attachment—should one stumble over a single grain of rice—one falls into indulgence, unable to conquer with firm resolve, and Zenhai Temple becomes the demon’s lair. The Master takes him to the temple, yet this very act of escorting becomes a burden; summoning the novice monk to lead him to the rear for rest is but to harbor the root of calamity. Vague and entangled, languid and ensnared, like a sick man unable to move forward. It is due to his Dao power being insufficient that he is not cautious at midnight, succumbing to the wind’s blow, unable to proceed on the path. Though his own ailment weighs him down, he still cannot forget the compassionate female Bodhisattva, hoping to bring her food to eat—this is but lingering affection, sinking into the sickness of indulgence. How could he not be trapped along the way, step by step ensnared, desiring to send a letter home and retrace his steps?*\n\nThe **Pilgrim** could not help but burst into laughter, saying, *\"Master, you are truly inept!\"* All suffering stems from the drowsy thought of a single nap, from stumbling over a grain of rice with the left foot.* The left* here means *error*—speaking of those on the Dao path who must not falter by even a grain of rice. If not a Dao cultivator, then one is often erring in the eyes of all beings. The Buddha thus does not concern himself with it.*\n\nYou see the monks unable to subdue dragons or tame tigers, unversed in recognizing demons or spirits—within three days, six of them were devoured. Is this not the case of *\"the foolish monk led astray by lust, thus losing his life\"*?\n\nOnly the **Pilgrim** knew of the demon’s cunning and strove to eliminate it, yet still nearly fell into its trap. As for **Tang Seng**, his mind already lost, how could he not be ensnared by the demon and dragged into the **Hollow Mountain**, into the **Bottomless Pit**?\n\nThe demon excels in its deceptive allure—its flower-footed illusion, empty-flight lures—none can escape its schemes. Even the **Wise Monkey**, struck by two demonic breaths, dodged only to fall into its trap. How much more so **Tang Seng**, tender and pitying, unaware of danger, suddenly plunged into ruin—this was his inevitable fate.\n\nThis was the result of **Tang Seng’s** left-foot misstep over a grain of rice, while the demon, in turn, shed its flowered shoe. I moved with my left, and it met me with its left—left against left—yet a single step’s error led to total ruin. As the saying goes: *\"A hair’s breadth difference leads to a thousand-li mistake.\"*\n\nAt that moment, his mind and spirit were in disarray, his homeland unsettled, chaos reigning without direction. Only now did he truly grasp the demon’s true menace.\n\nEarlier, **Tang Seng** had merely thought of sending a letter home to the East, yet his body had not yet moved. Now, his body itself turns back eastward—how could the three disciples fail to follow suit?\n\nFor the demon originally arose from the **Black Pine Grove**, suddenly appearing, and must still be sought there. Swiftly setting aside distractions, he must now compose himself, renew his resolve, and earnestly seek salvation.\n\nBy uncovering the truth of **Hollow Mountain** and the **Bottomless Pit**, he may learn its whereabouts and act in unison to rescue them—urgent as the wind, swift as the clouds, with no room for delay.\n\nThis very entrapment is a trial that **Dao cultivators** must endure. Without falling into the pit, one does not know how easily one might be ensnared. Without falling, one does not grasp the depth of its abyss. Who would have known the **Hollow Mountain’s** bottomless depths, had he not experienced it firsthand?\n\nThus, the demon’s **Hollow Mountain** and **Bottomless Pit** are the very **realized terrain** of **true practice**.\n\nAll illusory forms arise from the spontaneous stirrings of the mind within stillness.\n\nThe land spirit pointed toward *\"true south,\"*—the **Li** trigram above, the **Kan** below. The central line of **Qian** sinks to form **Li**; the central line of **Kun** ascends to form **Kan**. This is the **Kun** yin consuming the **Qian** yang—just as the female demon ensnares the **Elder**.\n\nThe character *\"flower shoe\"* (花鞋) is composed of two *\"people\"* and two *\"earth\"* radicals, with *\"hua\"* (化, transform) and *\"ge\"* (革,革革,革革革,革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革\n\nAh! The cunning **flower-shoe demon** slips free from the snare—truly dreadful!\n\nIn the **Eighty-Second Chapter**, *\"The Maid Seeks Yang\"* and *\"The Primordial Spirit Guards the Dao\"*, Master Wu Yi remarked: This passage cleverly uses the *\"Errant Spirit Falls into the Bottomless Pit\"* to stage a **sutra**-like performance, with hidden subtleties at every turn.\n\nThose with innate **Daoist** essence can silently guide their **spirit** and **mind**—the **Penglai** and **Eluyuan** lie before them.\n\nAlas! Though the **Soul Mountain** assembly gathers a thousand **Buddhas**, which one can escape this very place?\n\nWhen **practitioners** reach this juncture, they must swiftly gather their **spirit** and **mind**, resolutely seeking a path beyond. They must devise every means to find an exit.\n\nHere lies a **secret Vajra**—the *\"river-crossing ferry, the ladder to heaven\"*! The **Ancestral Master** dared not reveal it, so it remains concealed within these **nine-nine** cycles, returning to their beginning.\n\nThe **true mechanism** leaps forth, yet is held back—just as **Ziyu** said: *\"The capable follow it,\"* and here it is!\n\nThe *Cansong Contract* states:\n*\"The river maid, most refined and spirit-like,\nEncountering fire, she takes flight, leaving no trace.\nGhosts and dragons hide, none know her whereabouts.\nTo subdue her, yellow sprouts must be the root.\"*\n\nThe annotation reads: *\"Yellow sprouts—i.e., rabbit marrow, the gold within water.\"*\n\nThe **flower-shoe demon** embodies the **Kun** trigram. **Kun** obtains the **Qian** central line to form **Kan**; **Qian** transforms the **Kun** central line to become **Li**. The maid’s pursuit of **Yang** is the natural interplay of **yin** and **yang**.\n\nThose who study the **Dao** must retrieve the **Yang** from within **Kan** and solidify the **Yin** in **Li**, achieving an indestructible **true-gold** body.\n\nYet once **Yang** is ensnared in **Kan**, it is as if one has fallen into the **Bottomless Pit**—how then can one emerge?\n\nFor centuries, those who profane this **sacred text** have failed to grasp what the **Bottomless Pit** truly is—**sin**! **Sin**!\n\nThe **Kan** hexagram is void above and void below—clearly, a mountain hollowed with no bottom.\n\nThe lecture begins with *\"two female demons at the well drawing water.\"* The well is **Kan**; the demons are the **crawfish**. Two **yin** lines are plainly shown.\n\nThen it says: *\"On their heads, they wear a tall, one-foot-two-to-three-inch-high **‘mishu’** (髟狄) knot—quite unfashionable.\"* These two lines reveal the **secret essence** of refining the **gold elixir**—though the **Daoist Master** has exposed it, mortals fail to recognize.\n\nIn **Daoist** practice, one’s **qi** and **nature** must be gentle and yielding—no rigid boundaries. This aligns with **Laozi’s** *\"teeth firm, tongue soft\"* and the **Dao of War**: *\"The virtuous prevail.\"*\n\nThe **practitioner** says: *\"Gentleness conquers all; harshness falters even a step.\"* Again invoking **willow** and **sandalwood** as metaphors, deeply grasping **Laozi’s** meaning.\n\n*\"Two demons come here to draw this **yin-yang** copulating water, setting a pure feast\"*—the emphasis on *\"good\"* reveals that without **yin-yang** union, male remains male, female remains female, and *\"good\"* cannot arise.\n\n*\"Male and female copulate, all things transform and generate.\"* The **Daoist** path is complete.\n\nThe **bewildered**, reading this, mistakenly assume it refers to **sexual alchemy**—the farther they stray, the harder it is to find salvation.\n\nWhen the **practitioner** leaps in, he plunges into *\"a fine place indeed—this is a **Tian** realm of bliss!\"*\n\nYet within, one must grasp it firmly—never *\"lose true Yang, fall into the wheel of rebirth, and never rise again.\"* Swiftly seek an exit; do not forget, for it plainly teaches that **birth** comes from **life**, urging **respect** and **truth-preservation**, and to urgently find the **transcendent** union—never abandoning the original path.\n\n**Tripitaka** says: *\"I’ve forgotten the way in.\"*\n\nThis reminds all to seek the **ultimate cause** of escape from the very path they entered.\n\nThe **practitioner** says: *\"Do not speak of forgetting the way—this cave is strange, not meant for easy entry or exit. You came by diving headfirst and descending; now to save you, you must dive from below and ascend.\"*\n\nStill, *\"who knows if you have the skill to dig your way out?\"*\n\nAlas!\n\nThe **Daoist Master** speaks in subtle, cold tones, pointing to the **sutras** of transcending the world—seeming like a descent to ascend, yet truly not so.\n\nThe **discerning eye** understands this here: one may grasp the **Dao** of *\"following the natural order to become a sage, or opposing it to forge the elixir.\"*\n\nThe **practitioner** devises a way out, requiring within the wine cup to *\"pour forth the blossom of joy\"*—transforming into a **worm** to enter the belly, within the **liquid gold** to employ **alchemical techniques**.\n\nWho knows? The blossom has already scattered—nothing can be done.\n\nWhen the female seeks but the male does not respond, only the female’s heart holds *\"Brother, the marvelous one\"*—like **Yang** above and **Yin** below, the **Hexagram of *Nòu*** (☱), yet an empty joy. It is the image of *\"the eagle soaring, its talons wheeling—upsetting tables and overturning dishes, smashing bowls and plates.\"*\n\nThe **practitioner**, unable to escape, must turn and reenter, shifting to the **strategy of the red suit** (♥), teaching **Tang Seng** the **secret alchemical precepts** of false union.\n\nLater, their words and intentions align, their bond like *\"fish and water\"*—the **demon** then reveals the **dharma** of *\"fruit ripening on the branch, the interplay of Yin and Yang, Sun and Moon.\"* With tender emotions deepening, the **practitioner** acts in time—*\"a single somersault, and he flips into the belly.\"*\n\nNow the female leads, the male follows—truly *\"Brother, the marvelous one\"*—as **Yin** above and **Yang** below, the **Hexagram of *Tāi*** (☳), a real belly. The **demon** says: *\"Sun Wukong, how did you contrive to burrow into my stomach?\"* The **practitioner** replies: *\"It’s nothing strange—just eating your six-leaf liver and lungs, the three-hair heart, and all your five **zàng** organs clean, turning you into a **hollowed-out gourd spirit**!\"* Within the belly, he *\"punches, kicks, braces his limbs, and aligns the four directions,\"* nearly tearing apart the skin-sack.\n\nThe **demon**, unable to endure the pain, collapses in the dust. When lifted, she says: *\"My belly already holds a man! Quickly send this monk out!\"*\n\nWhat meaning do the **scholars** find in this spectacle?\n\nThe *\"Awakening to Truth\"* (悟真篇) states:\n*\"Though fruit grows on the branch, it must ripen in time—\nthe child in the womb, how could it differ?\"*\n\nThis clearly enacts the scene.\n\nOne may also perceive the **alchemical marvel** of *\"condensing the Five Phases\"* and their role in **elixir cultivation**.\n\nWhen the lesser demons all came to carry him, the monk inside cried out: *\"Who dares lift me? If you must, then you yourself must send my master out!\"*—a display of innate, unassisted **Dao** power, beyond mortal strength.\n\nThe demoness said: *\"So long as the bright moon lingers over the Five Lakes, what need is there to fear no place to cast the golden hook? Send this wretch out, and I’ll seek another head elsewhere.\"* With a leap, she vanished in a flash of light, straight to the cave’s mouth.\n\nJust then, the clatter of weapons rang out—*clink-clank, clink-clank*—in chaotic battle. The monk said: *\"That’s Eight Rules wielding his *pá*! Call him once.\"* The Master then called: *\"Eight Rules!\"*\n\nHearing this, Eight Rules replied: *\"Master Sand! The Teacher has emerged!\"*\n\nTo call Eight Rules was to gauge the **fire’s readiness**; to summon Master Sand was to attend to the **refinement’s intent**.\n\nAh! Just as the verse states:\n*\"The mind-monkey enters the cave to subdue the demon,\nEarth and wood unite at the gate to welcome the holy monk.\"*\n\nThis scene reveals the **alchemical subtlety** of the **elixir emerging from the furnace**.\n\nThe three share a single purpose—calculating perils, guarding against danger, ensuring the **principal and auxiliary** roles are fulfilled without neglect.\n\nThe **\"Maiden of Vermilion\"** seeks **yang** as the **Great Dao**,\nwhile the **\"Original Spirit\"** guards the **Way** with hidden teachings.\n\nAll mortals enter her cave—\nthose who preserve their **True Nature** without drowning,\nwho calculate their own escape—who can do so?\n\nThe lost do not probe the **yin-yang** from the heart,\nnor seek a teacher’s guidance to attain the **Supreme Vehicle**.\nInstead, they mistake **copulation and domination** as the path,\nand thus sow the seeds of **Hell**, never to escape in ten thousand kalpas!\n\nBeware! Tremble!\n\nThe preceding chapter laid the roots of those who fall into the cave;\nthis chapter reveals the **karma and consequences** of those who emerge.\n\n**Chapter 83: The Mind-Monkey Recognizes the Elixir’s Core**\n**The Vermilion Maiden Returns to Her True Nature**\n\nThe Master of Awakening said:\nThe **Dao of transcending the world** lies in subduing the **golden essence**.\nIf one knows the method of subjugation yet lacks cultivation,\nand fails to grasp its truth,\nthen one cannot return to the origin and restore the fundamental.\n\nWhen **principle and desire** wage war,\nthey remain separate from **True Nature**,\ninevitably **soaring and unrestrained**—\nwild and rampant—\nleaving one ungrounded.\nThis is what is meant by:\n*\"Cultivation insufficient, no square nor round.\"*\n\nThe **Tang Monk’s** repeated fall after escape\narises from incomplete understanding\nand untrue attainment.\n\nThus, the essence of seeking the **elixir**\ndemands meticulous inquiry into the roots,\nto recognize the **core of the elixir**.\n\nThe **Celestial Master** feared the world would mistake falsehood for truth,\nso he revealed this passage\nto discern its subtle profundity.\nIf one views it merely as *\"water’s end and clouds’ ascent,\"*\na sudden turn after exhaustion—\nmerely a literary flourish—\nthen the author’s **benevolent intent** is buried.\n\nThe **Sutra** states:\n*\"Gold returns to its original nature—\nonly then may it be called the **Returning Elixir**.\"*\n\nWhen the practitioner forces the **peach** into his belly,\ncompelling the **monkey** to carry the monk out,\nit is not from **voluntary harmony** or **natural liberation**.\nThus, upon emerging, he **reassembles his forces**,\nengages in chaotic battle,\nleaving the **Tang Monk** alone and unsupported—\nthis violates the **principle of harmonious integration**.\nSince the **gold** does not return to **True Nature**,\nbut **water, fire, earth, and wood** contend,\nthe **gold** is a false form—\nfirst misplaced on the **left**,\nnow misplaced on the **right**.\nHence, the **flowered shoe** on the **right foot**\nagain shifts and cannot settle.\n\nThe **essence of the child** is the substance of the **Kan (Abyss)**.\nWhen it emerges from the earth,\nit is also called the **Earth-Surging Lady**.\nHave you not heard of the **Earth-Surging Golden Lotus**?\nThe **Golden Lotus** is the **Lady’s delicate toes**,\nadorned with **flowered shoes**.\n\nThe **shoes**, clinging to the **Kun (Receptive, earth)**, walk—\nthis is **returning to True Nature**.\nWhen cast off and rising into emptiness,\nit is **soaring and unrestrained**—\nthe **gold** does not return to **True Nature**.\n\nThe **left** belongs to **yang**, the **right** to **yin**.\nPreviously, **excessive yang** spun left—\nyet the **left was false**.\nNow, **excessive yin** spins right—\nyet the **right is false**.\n\n**\"Shoes\"**—a **play on words**.\nHow can **left and right** scatter?\nThus, one cannot **stand firmly on the earth**,\ncannot remain steady.\n\n「Yet the **Xīnniǔ (Maiden of Beauty)** is my true nature, so why call her a **démon (妖)**?\n\n**Returning to True Nature** is the **True Essence (真精)**,\nwhile **departing from True Nature** becomes the **Démonic Essence (妖精)**.\n**Returning to True Nature** makes me **whole in truth**,\nwhile **departing from True Nature** turns me into a **démon’s essence**,\nand I fall into its snare.\n\n*\"The Tang Monk was seized and held in one embrace,\nhis reins severed—both man and horse were dragged away.\"*\nAll because he could not subdue the **True Gold (真金)**,\nhis roots were not firm, and his reins were broken.\n\nThe **Tang Monk’s steed’s** strength in its hooves\nwas never greater than the **Démonic Essence’s flowered shoes**,\nso it must be tamed and made its foundation.\n\nThe **Great Sage** saw the half-severed reins,\nand felt helpless sorrow welling up—\ntears streamed from his eyes.\nHe turned swiftly, with fierce resolve,\nseeking the origin’s root,\nonly then could he find true remedy.\n\nSeeing the **Golden Character Tablet (金字牌)**,\nhe recognized his father’s and elder brother’s names,\nand thus knew the **Dan (丹, cinnabar)**—\nwas he not filled with joy?\n\nIf his father **returned to True Nature**,\nwhere could his son go?\nHe **clutched the Tablet** and ascended to the **Heavenly Palace (天堂)**,\nto **report to the Jade Emperor (玉帝)**,\nand thus his kin could be saved.\n\nThis is the **strategy of capturing the thief by seizing the king’s hand**,\nthe **key to tracing origins and uncovering roots**.\n\nWhen the **Jade Emperor** commanded **Tai Bai (太白, the Great White Star)** to summon **Li Tianwang (李天王, the Heavenly King of the Li clan)** to the **court of judgment (对簿)**,\nthe Heavenly King failed to recognize her as a **female**,\nand **Ne Zha (哪吒)** revealed her lineage—\n*\"The thief from the Sacred Mountain stole the Buddha’s fragrant flowers and lamps.\"*\nOnly then did he realize she was his **sworn sister (结拜)** by fate.\n\nYet how could she be a **sworn sister**,\nif she was born of his clan?\nThe Heavenly King bears the **Li (李) surname**,\nwhich belongs to **wood (木)**.\nBy the **wood’s children (木之子)**, **fire (火)** is meant,\nso how could his daughter be of **gold (金)**,\nwith a **golden nose and white fur (金鼻白毛)**?\n\nA **golden form throughout her body**?\nHe did not know that **gold in water (水中之金)** can subdue wood,\nyet **gold** also **engenders water (生水)** to nourish wood;\nthat **fire in wood (木中之火)** can restrain gold,\nyet **fire** also **engenders earth (生土)** to give rise to gold.\n\nThe grudge came first, then the bond—\nthus she became his **sworn sister** by fate.\n\nThe *Awakening to Truth* says:\n*\"The Gold Prince was once the Eastern House’s son,\nsent to the Western Neighbor to take root and be reborn.\nRecognized and called back to his ancestral home to be nurtured,\npaired with a radiant maiden as kin by fate.\"*\nWithin lies a hidden marvel of inversion—\nwords cannot fully capture its depth.\n\nWhy call her **\"Half-Observed Guanyin\"**?\nGuanyin is **water and moon**—\nwithout water, no moon’s fullness.\nThe radiant maiden is but **gold in water**—\nis she not half?\n\nNow, *\"the essence lies in the southeast black horn with its hidden aperture,\"*\nand the gold returns to its original nature in the Eastern House—\njust as the nuptial chamber’s candles glow,\n**black qi swirling, faint fragrance perfuming the air**—\nthe moment of perfect union.\n\n*\"The Pilgrim found Tang Sanzang and his horses and baggage,\"*\nand the **foot-strength** was already prepared.\nThis old demon, with no path left,\nknelt in submission—\nthe Heavenly King and Prince escorting the demon back to the palace.\n\nFrom now on, Tang Sanzang and his four disciples\nmay ride horses, carry burdens, and march onward along the Great Path.\n\nThus, those refining the **elixir** must first subdue and temper the **golden essence**,\nenduring unyielding, unbroken—\nonly then can the **foot-root** stand firm,\nand only then may they advance westward.\n\nNow, these sentient beings drown in the **sea of desire** without repentance,\nburn in the **pit of wrath** without cleansing,\nfall into the **trap of greed** without complaint,\nplunge into the **abyss of fame** without awakening,\nsleep drunk in the **moat of death** without waking,\nstray on the **path of delusion** without returning,\nentangled in the **net of glory** without escape—\nall blinded to their true nature, sinking into emptiness,\nwith no end in sight.\n\nAlas!\n\nThe previous chapter concealed the true gold in **Zhenhai Temple**,\nthis one reveals the **golden position** and **golden furnace** as recognizing the **elixir’s essence**.\nWhat is transcended: the **golden lotuses** on either side;\nwhat is subdued: the **white-furred golden nose**.\nSpeak of this inner true gold—\nit is the **elixir’s supreme secret**, not to be overlooked.\n\n---\n**Eighty-fourth Chapter**\n*\"The Unquenchable Flame of Gajidhara’s Great Awakening\"*\n*\"The Law-King’s Natural Perfection\"*\n\nA disciple of enlightenment says:\nThis passage speaks only of **all dharmas being empty**,\nwith no attachment—\nthus the great meaning is fulfilled.\n\nHumanity’s nature is **originally round and awakened**,\nwith no division between self and others.\nWhen **self and dharma** arise, division appears.\nIf **self has no dharma**, others extinguish my nothingness;\nif **others possess dharma**, I extinguish their dharma with my own.\nOnly when **self and others both lack dharma**,\nand the **heavenly body** is perfectly round,\ndoes **Great Awakening** emerge.\n\nIn the **Dao**,\n**insight** is the **gateway to marvel**,\n**stillness** the **true essence**,\n**wise thought** the **armor and shield**,\n**discriminating wisdom** the **sword and spear**.\nBreaking the **inner demon’s high ramparts**,\ncrushing the **outer foe’s fortified ranks**,\npacifying the chaotic and explaining the ensnared.\n\nDeeply knowing that **form and substance** cannot long endure,\nyet the **true spirit** persists through countless eons.\nUnderstanding **transformation’s impermanence**,\nthe **abiding** lies only within myself.\n\nNot originally **dharma**, it cannot be spoken of as dharma;\nnot originally **teaching**, it cannot be transmitted as teaching.\nAs it is said:\n*\"Round and red, not a thread nor a hair.\"*\n\nYet within it lies a **foundation of firm footing**—\nif one drifts like a rudderless boat,\nlost in empty vagueness,\nthe Buddha calls it **\"vague and empty\"**—\nstill, it is the plight of falling into the **bottomless abyss of emptiness**.\n\nConfucius said:\n*\"One may stand with him, but not yet be entrusted with authority.\"*\nOnly when one can **stand firm** may one speak of **authority**.\n\nThe immortal master opened his mouth to say:\n\n*\"The Three Treasures clings to the Original Yang,\nescaping the bottomless demonic pit—\nfollowers must advance westward!\"*\n\nThis is when one’s **foundation is firmly established**,\nthe moment one may **stand firm**.\n\nYet still, it is not yet sufficient.\nThus, the text suddenly presents an aged mother’s loud cry:\n*\"Monk, do not proceed!\nWestward lies only the path of death!\"*\n\nThis great sage, with his **compassionate vessel**,\nsplits the path with a single strike—\nblocking the way, he makes clear:\n*\"Not to blend with the mundane,\nnor to follow the round and square—\none step is unworkable!\"*\n\nNow, observe the **Destruction of the Dharma-realm** at hand,\nuttering the **wish of ten thousand monks**,\nslaying the **nameless**,\nawaiting only the **named**—\nuntil the ten thousand are gathered,\nplainly pointing out that **all dharma is but an empty shadow**.\n\nThe Three Treasures then sought a **skillful path** to pass through,\nbut the aged mother laughed:\n*\"You cannot pass!\nYou cannot pass!\"*\n\nIn that laughter, she rejoiced at his **not taking a direct route**,\nand mocked his **twisting and turning in vain**.\nOne must walk the **middle path**—\nthere lies a **skillful gate**,\nto traverse through;\ndo not stray into **devious side paths**,\nlest you lose your way entirely.\n\nThus again he hurriedly called out to stop them.\n\nFor **skillful means** are not contrary to the **Way** itself,\nbut rather, to weigh the **light and heavy** along the **true path**,\nto bend one’s heart without abruptness—\nthus must one **seek the Dao** until the journey’s end.\n\nSince the **Han dynasty** onward, none have truly understood its meaning,\nand so they abandon the **middle path** to take **devious side paths**—\nhow could they align with **reason**?\n\nThose who cannot uphold the **Way** invariably enter **erroneous paths**,\nand cloak their **skillful means** in pretense to justify their **deviance**;\nwhile those who practice **skillful means** in truth\nmust follow the **right path**, transforming the **Way** to serve the **orthodox**.\n\nThis is the **true skillful gate** of the **middle path**—\nthe **skillful means** of **sages, immortals, and Buddhas**.\n\nPast readers of *Journey to the West* have seen the **Great Sage’s** appearance\nas mere literary exhaustion, unable to grasp these **cool, idle words**—\nall profound in meaning.\n\n**Dao** is that which **does nothing yet nothing remains undone**.\nIts **substance** is **emptiness and non-being**,\nits **function** is **following and adapting**.\nWithout fixed form, without enduring shape,\nit thus explores the **emotions of all things**;\nneither preceding nor following things,\nit thus becomes the **master of all things**.\n\nWith **dharma** or without **dharma**, it acts according to the **time**;\nwith **precepts** or without **precepts**, it harmonizes with **sentient beings**.\nThus it is said:\n*\"The sage is imperishable, for he guards with the times.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"Change and move without abiding, shifting with the flow of the age.\"*\nThis is the **true intent** of the **Great Sage’s** westward journey to guide the world.\n\nThe instruction having been made clear,\nhe turned straight back to the **Southern Seas**.\n\nThe **Pilgrim** then concealed his name to avoid danger,\ntransforming into a **moth-lantern** to advance by the **light**,\nobserving carefully and acting in accordance with the **opportunity**;\nwhen the **Way** was clear, he changed his attire,\nimitating the **disguise of a humble servant** in the **Song dynasty**—\ntruly blending with the mundane, not clinging to his own form.\n\nHe surveyed every detail of the inn’s guests,\nattentive to the **hardships of the world**,\nthe **innkeeper’s wife** with child\nadopting the **common guise** of the age;\n\nseizing the moment to **steal**,\nexploiting the situation to **play tricks**,\nstirring the **true essence of Heaven’s machinations**,\nrevealing a **lively and spirited** manifestation of **qi**.\n\n*\"Disguised as a commoner near the city,\naltering my name to suit the official’s register;\na **horse merchant**, with ten brothers;\na **Han man** leading horses into the shop,\na **woman** inviting guests upstairs;\nasking for the **lamps** to examine the **wares**,\nboasting of my **horse numbers**,\npraising my **room’s breadth**;\nnegotiating the **room fee**,\ndiscussing the **price of meals**;\ncalling for the **slaughter of livestock**,\nstumbling on the **threshold**;\nsetting the **taboo day** for **abstinence**,\nopening the **shop on the next day**;\n**young mistress**, you’ll come tomorrow;\nwhere shall I sleep? Leaning against the **counter**;\n**daughter** holding a **child**, speaking close by;\nno **buying or selling**, just a **horse merchant**;\nwanting to **sleep in darkness**, there’s a **large counter**;\ncovering it with a **blanket**, come early.\"*\n\nThis is all the art of conforming to human nature and worldly affairs, revealing how the Wayfarer transcends self-attachment and adapts with boundless flexibility—*\"able to wield an unimpeded mind, entering all things universally. Seeing without defilement, knowing without grasping. This is called true seeing, also called liberated knowing. The Buddha perceives beyond birth and death, all dharmas thus equal.\"*\n\nAh! Without worldly law, there is no Buddhist law—realizing that no-mind is the Dao-mind. The most subtle part is the *\"Entering the Counter to Stir Ghosts\"* passage.\n\nLaozi says: *\"A skilled merchant hides his goods as if empty.\"* If one has no worldly possessions, why not feign emptiness while revealing substance? Boldly brandishing the law like a torch, one knows the peril of being caught in darkness by light; robbing the horse merchant reveals the danger of arrogance inviting theft.\n\nThe law’s net is dense—everywhere, one must beware. All are the Wayfarer’s embodied teachings.\n\nAt this stage, the Great Sage displays boundless, transcendent transformations—left arm, right arm, left as right, nothing unsuited. Manipulated on the palm, left and right flow effortlessly. Thus, a single shake of the Golden Hoop scatters across the six directions; gathering into truth, it retreats into the hidden.\n\n*\"Form and spirit both perfect, harmonizing with the Dao’s truth—thus able to multiply the body into countless transformations, pluck a hair to forge countless weapons.\"* From the highest palaces and ministries to the lowest officials and commoners, noble or lowly, great or small—spontaneous divine power shifts forms and moves emotions.\n\nThis is the Wayfarer’s body transforming into a blade, shaving every hair clean, making self and others one, all rounded into perfection, unrestricted movement, natural as heaven—is this not like one suddenly awakening from a dream?\n\nAh! Destroying law through law, revering law to attain law—law has no fixed form. Such is its nature.\n\nThe Eighty-Fifth Chapter: The Heart-Monkey Envious of the Wood Mother, the Demon King’s Scheme to Devour Zen\n\nThe Sage said: This chapter—readers may say that the earlier demons were beyond comparison, but this one is merely ordinary, as if hastily written. Yet what seems unremarkable is truly wondrous: what can be thought of is not what should be thought at all.\n\nThe previous section exposed the emptiness of human nature and worldly affairs, revealing all dharmas as void. One must blend with the world, adapting to circumstances—whether square or round—though outwardly responding to events, yet rooted in the boundless luminosity of the heart’s essence. Fearful that others might not perceive this from the heart, the Immortal Master forcefully turns outward to inward, emphasizing the profound intent of *\"The Heart Sutra is not to be sought far away,\"* urging one to recognize this heart and never harbor the slightest obstruction, lest one fall into demonic snares.\n\nFor the Holy Heart is like a mirror-still pool—ever luminous, ever tranquil, ever responsive yet ever still. All uses arise from its singular essence, and its essence never strays from all uses. Thus it is said: *\"The body of wisdom is silent and still, its function radiant and suchness.\"*\n\nYet if even a speck of obstruction arises, the heart’s essence grows murky and clogged, and its outer functions become deceitful—like mist veiling the soul’s faculties, where Zen is swallowed whole, as though dense fog concealed within the transparent layers of the *Lianhuan Cave*, shattering the sky-piercing pillars!\n\nThus the next section is titled: *\"Hidden Mist Mountain, the Broken Peak, the Linked-Ring Cave.\"* The Five Peaks are the celestial pillars; the One Heart is the master of the body. When the peaks collapse, the sky lacks support; when the heart is obscured, the body loses its root. Actions unrooted in the heart become nothing but afflictions—what Zen remains?\n\nZen seeks to dissolve demons; the staff is wielded to subdue them. Yet how does the demon wield the staff and devour Zen? Zen stills but one mind, while the demon traverses the Six Realms. To bind Zen and extinguish dharma is for the demon to govern demons—how can it avoid becoming a gluttonous maw, greedily consuming living Zen?\n\nWhy? Because following desire is not Zen-mind. It splits into precepts, concentration, and wisdom—expanding into the Six Perfections, dispersing into myriad practices. Zen is but one of the Six Perfections—how can it encompass all dharmas? Few escape becoming demonic.\n\nMoreover, Zen-mind is hard to purify, and the golden and wooden essences remain unmelted. How could one then reject all existence and eliminate all dharmas without falling into calculation? If all dharmas are void, it is not that there are no dharmas. The heart gives rise to all dharmas yet does not belong to them. Those who attain it find dharma at their command, verified from the heart, arising as desired—neither identical nor different, neither different nor identical; neither dharma nor non-dharma, neither non-dharma nor non-non-dharma. How could one seek it by clinging to traces?\n\nDharma is like a tuft of hair. External dharmas are like the body’s bearing—without dharma, it is a loss of decorum. The opening lines, spoken by the ministers, plainly state *\"loss of decorum.\"* Yet the subtlety of dharma’s empty nature is beyond those who cling to worldly dharmas. The minister says, *\"I do not know,\"* the king replies, *\"Indeed, you do not know,\"*—each weeping profusely, truly pitiful.\n\nWhen the king repents of killing and the entire kingdom takes refuge, changing *\"destroying dharma\"* to *\"revering dharma,\"* it embodies the principle *\"The Buddha has no fixed form; no abiding birth-mind.\"* For clinging to dharma is to destroy dharma; not clinging to dharma is to revere dharma. Thus sitting in Zen is sitting as Buddha; sitting as Buddha is killing Buddha. Clinging to dharma is fixing the mind; a fixed mind is demonic mind.\n\nThe Elder on horseback joyfully declared, *\"Wukong, this principle is excellent, of great merit.\"* Already, all dharmas return to One—every aspect radiates the Dao’s essence. Sha Wujing immediately continued, *\"Brother...\"*\n\n「Where could one find so many artisans of such craft?」\nIn the secular world, this is called *\"losing decorum\"* (失仪); in the Buddhist law, it is called *\"crafting appearances\"* (整容).\nThough seemingly opposed, they mutually complement each other—such is the law’s refusal to be rigidly fixed.\nThis is the principle that *dharma has no fixed form*, its transformations boundless, its wondrous play unfolding through roots and mind.\n\nThe Pilgrim recited this once, then swiftly chanted the four lines of the *Heart Sutra’s Preface* (《多心经》四句《颂子》):\n*\"The Buddha is not sought afar on Spirit Mountain—\nSpirit Mountain stands within your own mind.\nEach person has a Spirit Mountain stupa—\nPractice beneath it, and you shall find.\"*\n\nThe Tang Monk said, *\"All scriptures and teachings boil down to cultivating the mind.\"*\n*\"When the mind is pure, clarity shines alone;\nWhen the mind harbors dharma, all worlds grow clear.\nA moment’s negligence breeds slackness—\nNo success in ten thousand years, no matter how long.\nBut with a single thread of true sincerity,\nThe Voice of Thunder resounds right before your eyes.\"*\n\nThis *\"mind\"* is the very focus of the two preceding passages.\n\nThe Monkey was of the *Jin-Water Hour* (金水), the Pig of the *Hai-Wood-Fire Hour* (亥木火)—\nThough they clash, they also complete each other.\nThe Monkey, laboring yet weary, harbors resentment from exhaustion;\nThe Pig, slack from idleness, deceives through comparison.\nBelow, it was precisely this negligence and lack of sincerity that caused the error—\nThus the sudden rise of wind and mist.\n\n*\"Eight Rules [of Conduct] shirks duty,\nThe Pilgrim deceives him, calling demons ‘good’ and mist ‘qi.’\nSteamed rice, flatbread, vegetables—\nLittle eaten, but the mouth complains.\nThe horse must be fed first—\nFresh grass sought before its meal.\nFine food for the handsome, coarse for the ugly;\nMumbling ‘Great Sage!’ from his lips.\"*\n\nTheir words ring hollow, deceit between them—\nGreedy, lazy, mouth and heart misaligned—\nIs this not falling into the *Circle of Demonic Illusions*?\n\nHad the Pilgrim not turned his mind inward and secretly intervened,\nTheir hidden deceit and broken precepts would have sealed their fate.\nThus, when the heart’s sincerity is absolute, demons retreat;\nWhen the mind wanders, demons manifest.\nDemons are not external—they are shadows summoned by one’s own heart.\n\nObserve how the Pilgrim and Eight Rules were deceived by the clear wind and mist—\nThe demon, to deceive them, gathered the wind and dispersed the mist.\nWhen the Pilgrim and Eight Rules sought to eat the offering,\nThe demon demanded the monk instead;\nWhen the Pilgrim spoke of steamer’s vapor,\nThe demon scraped the pot to steam the monk.\nEight Rules and the Pilgrim disguised themselves as a short monk and false Pilgrim—\nThe demon became a false demon in return.\nThe Pilgrim employed the *Divided Body Technique*—\nThe demon countered with the *Sliced Plum Blossom Scheme*.\nWhen the Pilgrim saw the demon defeated and turned back,\nThe demon retreated to its cave, silent and still.\nThe Pilgrim called Eight Rules *\"Vanguard General\"*—\nThe demon anointed a minor demon as *\"Scout.\"*\n\nSincerity makes *Chan* the master, swallowing demons;\nNegligence makes demons the master, devouring *Chan*.\nLike the pole’s shadow or echo in the valley—\nBlurred, indistinguishable.\n*Chan* or *demon*?\nOne or two?\n\nThe demon bound the Tang Monk to a tree,\nAnd the woodcutter likewise bound to the tree,\nEach speaking of loyalty to lord and filial piety—\nTheir deepest, most sincere words.\n\nThe tree, with roots and branches,\nIs the foundation of all things.\nA just ruler and filial parent are the great Dao of heaven and earth,\nWhile loyalty and filial virtue are the roots of human nature—\nBoth spring from the true nature of the heart,\nAdorned with no false pretense or artifice.\n\nTo bow in devotion, serving with utmost loyalty,\nAnd to nurture life while honoring death—\nNot betraying the lord’s grace—\nThis is the true attainment of the sacred scripture.\n\nTo exhaust one’s strength in filial duty,\nNurturing life and honoring death—\nRepaying the debt of parental kindness—\nThis is the true reverence for the living Buddha.\n\nIf one does not act from the root of true nature,\nBut instead feigns loyalty and filial piety in outward show,\nThen it is like the hidden leopard of Aiyue Mountain,\nWielding the staff of demon-subduing in reverse—\nDevouring *Chan* while disguised as virtue.\n\nLost in the root, cloaked in false filiality as demon—\nHow easily one may be lamented and defeated!\n\nOh, Three Treasures and woodcutter—\nHow could they not be moved to sorrow and grief?\n\nThe profound meaning leaps beyond the text,\nBeyond the strokes of the brush.\n\nIs it plain?\nOr wondrous?\nCan it be contemplated and imitated?\nOr is it beyond contemplation and imitation?\n\nThe Eighty-Sixth Episode: *Mu* Mother Aids in Subduing the Fiend\n*Jin* Father Applies the Dao to Exterminate the Demon\n\n*Wu Yi Zi* said: This continues from the previous section, speaking of the Dao/Way being obscured by *Chan* (meditation).\n\nDue to negligence and deceit, one must diligently awaken and discipline oneself—never allowing the slightest falsehood or pretense—then can one penetrate the inner and outer, and comprehend the interconnected cycles of cause and effect.\n\n*\"Hidden Mist Mountain, the Aiyue Leopard’s Linked and Pierced Illusion\"*—its meaning was clarified earlier.\n\nThe one who calls himself *\"Nan Shan Da Wang\"* (Southern Mountain King), *Nan* (south) being the *Li* (trigram of wood) and belonging to the heart—\n*\"For hundreds of years, I have roamed here\"*—speaks of his demonic form arising from long indulgence of the heart, hence he is singled out to refute his arrogance by invoking Laozi, the Buddha, and Confucius, the three great sages of the teachings.\n\nThe Fifth Patriarch said:\n*\"The body is the Bodhi tree, the mind the mirror platform.\nEver diligently wipe and polish it,\nLest dust gather upon it.\"*\n\nFurther still:\n*\"Bodhi has no tree, the mirror no platform.\nOriginally, there is no single thing—\nWhere could dust gather upon it?\"*\n\nThough their exhortations differ in tone,\nboth illuminate the mind’s proper clarity and purity.\n\nThe boar belongs to *Hai* (the eleventh earthly branch), *Hai* being wood;\nthe monkey belongs to *Shen* (the ninth earthly branch), *Shen* being metal.\nWhen out of harmony, metal subdues wood, creating jealousy;\nwhen in harmony, metal generates water to nourish wood,\nand the fire within wood generates earth to foster metal—\nthus it aids.\n\nMetal and wood have both restraining and fostering relationships.\nMetal becomes true gold when refined by water and fire;\nwood thrives when nourished by metal and water.\nThe original pairing of husband and wife\nnever truly departs.\n\nWhen husband and wife live in harmony, the household prospers;\nwhen metal and water are balanced, the body and life align—\nthis is the Dao/Way of water’s inherent tranquility,\nwhich calms inner and outer, repelling chaos.\nThus, the demon is subdued from this very source.\n\nYet though the demon comes from without,\nits true origin lies within the mind.\nSo whatever the mind creates,\nthe demon knows;\nwhatever the demon creates,\nthe mind knows.\n\nThe practitioner recognizes this as *\"the Plum Blossom’s Divided Petal Strategy\"*,\nand also knows *\"the demon’s dwelling is here—my master must be in this very place\"*,\nboth insights arising from the mind’s own discernment.\n\nYet the most perilous deception is when the false resembles the true—\nlike the demon crafting a human head from a willow tree,\nwhich is easily discerned as false;\nbut far more treacherous is when it mimics the true,\nsuch as the demon fashioning a fresh human head as the master,\nseemingly real yet not—\nmost difficult to recognize.\nThus the practitioner brothers failed to perceive and wept together in lament.\n\nThe distinction between true and false is subtle,\nyet the root of right and wrong is easily confused.\n\nBut why did they weep as one?\nWas it because the practitioner truly believed in the illusion\nand led the crowd in grief?\n\nSorrow can turn black silk to green or yellow,\nand diverging paths can lead east or west.\nTheir unified weeping holds profound meaning!\n\nOnly through great lamentation\ncan one either mistake the false for the true,\nor seek the true while abandoning the false.\nHow so?\n\nWeeping is the mind’s pain—\nwith sound and tears, both arise from genuine sincerity,\nable to awaken true awareness.\nThe demon confuses me with falsehood,\nbut I master it with truth—\nthen evil cannot overcome righteousness,\nand the demon vanishes.\n\nThus, *\"Strive forward, shatter the Stone Gate!\"*\nand the fortress collapses.\n\nThose who once sought ease and slacked in discipline,\nnow suddenly rouse courage and sharpen their resolve—\nthe Southern Mountain King’s reckless form\ncan no longer be fully comprehended!\n\nBefore, the practitioner raised a false doppelgänger to summon the demon;\nnow, he employs a true doppelgänger to dispel it—\n*\"Strike from without, slay from within the ranks,\"*\nunited force and will, inner and outer assault—\noverthrowing the scheming *Cang Lang* (blue wolf),\nblocking the long-indulgent old fiend,\nthen calming the *qi* and preserving the mind,\nexamining its gateways,\npenetrating its origins and currents,\nslipping unseen into its lair—\ntrue and false now fully revealed,\ngreat demons and small, all trembling in confusion.\nWhat fear could there be of its plots and harm?\n\nRecognizing it as demonic,\nrefining its essence to true insight,\nall fiends fall, instantly silenced—\nits original form exposed,\nand the false paths shattered.\n\nOnly then does the true manifest,\nthe false perish,\nits roots severed, its form laid bare.\nThe Aiyue Leopard’s superficial illusions are removed,\nand my true mind remains unharmed.\nThis is how the woodcutter’s filial devotion,\nmoving heaven and earth,\nescaped death and glimpsed his mother’s true nature.\n\nThe woodcutter said:\n*\"Now the mountain is at peace,\nand I may travel through the night.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"This path leads west for less than a thousand *li*.\"*\n\nAh!\n\nThe inner and outer as one,\npenetrating through surface and depth—\nhow near we stand to the Land of Ultimate Bliss!\nThis is the Dao’s true measure.\n\n**Chapter Eighty-Seventh: The Phoenix Immortal County—Defying Heaven’s Drought, the Great Sage Sun Wukong Urges Benevolence to Bring Rain**\n\nThe Awakened One said:\n*\"This passage reveals that those who cultivate the True Way must first amass hidden virtue.\nBefore hidden virtue is complete,\neven a beautiful name is useless,\nand a half-finished deed collapses.\nGhosts and spirits cannot silently aid,\nand all deeds remain hollow pretense.\nOne must urgently turn inward and reflect,\nawaken boundless compassion,\nobserve strict discipline with diligent progress,\nand widely cultivate hidden virtue.*\n\n*What is hidden virtue?*\nCultivating one’s own *heaven* to honor others’ *heaven*—this is hidden virtue;\nacting secretly with skillful means—this is hidden virtue;\ngiving without expecting repayment—this is hidden virtue;\naccumulating goodness unknown to others—this is hidden virtue;\nnot forcing others into peril—this is hidden virtue;\nconcealing others’ flaws—this is hidden virtue.\n\nThe *sutra* says:\n*'When they bring calamity, I bring fortune;\nWhen they bring enmity, I bring virtue.'*\nAll these are deeds of hidden virtue,\nboundless in dispelling disasters and karmic retribution.\n\n*The Awakening of the True* says:\n*'Great joy lies in what is easy to know,'*\nfor knowledge comes from both self and *heaven*.\n\nIf one does not accumulate deeds and hidden virtue,\ndemons and fiends will obstruct at every turn.\nFor though one’s fate is not entirely by *heaven*,\nit lies in the marvel of creation within oneself;\nand though it is also by *heaven*,\nthe silent power of reflection rests with *heaven*.\n\nThe practitioner says:\n*'Only by amassing merit and virtue can I grant you this great rain,'*\n—this is the essence of this passage.\n\nThe name *'Phoenix Immortal County'* signifies a land of transcendent virtue,\nyet now it fails to accumulate hidden merit while boasting hollow fame.\nThough it claims to love the people outwardly,\nit secretly harms them.\nWith the people’s lives hanging in peril,\nhow can the true ruler appease *heaven’s* wrath?\n\nYet the county magistrate, *Shangguan*,\nis *'tenfold in his uprightness'* and *'deep in his love for the people.'*\nHis plea for rain to save the people is a deed of boundless goodness—\nhow then does he fail to move *heaven*?\n\nIt is said:\n*'This is outward virtue, not hidden virtue.'*\n\nFor though he is *'tenfold in his uprightness,'*\nhe is too bright, too rigid in righteousness—\nlike the fierce *yang* force,\nand thus *'unbenevolent.'*\nThe *Hongfan Transmission* says:\n*'If bright, then drought.'*\nBrightness is *yang* force unbalanced by *yin* to harmonize it.\nWithout *yin*’s nourishing flow,\nthe land’s vitality cannot penetrate deep,\nhuman efforts falter below,\nand *heaven’s* response manifests above—\ndrought is its sign.\n\nThus, rulers must embody benevolence and relief,\nwidely practice hidden virtue,\nand not prize mere clarity as wisdom.\n\nThe sages have said:\n*'Brightness without compassion is worse than ignorance.'*\nYao’s three pardons,\nYu’s descent from his chariot,\nTang’s release of the fishnets—\nall were brightness tempered by compassion.\n\nOfficials who receive *heaven’s* bounty,\nholding their posts by imperial command,\nmust cherish the land and its people—\nthis is their duty.\nWhat virtue do they possess?\n\nTrue virtue is known only to *heaven*,\nnot to mortals.\nYet when *'three years ago, on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month,\nShangguan’s household overturned the vegetarian offerings for the gods to feed dogs,\nand spoke blasphemous words, defying *heaven,’*\nthis was hidden evil—\nknown only to *heaven*, not to men.\n\nThe people are *heaven’s* creation;\n*heaven* loves all it creates.\nIf a ruler embodies *heaven’s* heart in loving the people,\nhe will surely receive *heaven’s* hidden reward—\nthis is an unchanging principle.\n\nTo love the people must begin with revering *heaven*,\nhence the saying: *'Revere *heaven* and diligently tend the people.'*\nNow Shangguan cannot revere *heaven* but instead profanes it—\nno greater crime exists!\n\nFor the people, food is *heaven*.\nThe offerings are what the people rely on for sustenance,\nthe foundation *heaven* uses to nourish them.\nTo overturn them for dogs is to deceive and extinguish both *heaven* and the people—\nwhat greater lack of benevolence could there be?\n\nThus, a thousand outward good deeds\ncannot outweigh one hidden evil act.\n\nHence the Sage is cautious in public and vigilant in solitude,\nwhile the virtuous man guards his private conduct.\n\nFor *yin* is the realm of solitary knowledge,\nand *virtue* is what one attains in the heart.\nIt is neither name-seeking nor reputation-chasing.\n\nWhen the roof leaks, the streets become thoroughfares;\nin dreams, night merges with day.\nSpirit and breath silently commune with the imperial throne—\nthe speed of response surpasses even drumbeats!\n\nYet the one who has incurred *heaven’s* wrath is the magistrate—\nhow then does disaster descend upon the common folk?\n\nThe magistrate is the wind, the people the grass:\nif the magistrate is unbenevolent, the people become unrighteous.\nAbove and below follow in kind—\n*qi* and kindred natures resonate.\nDay and night, his guilt festers into the people’s hidden anxieties;\na single moment of irreverence spreads as fate’s blessing or ruin for all.\n\nIf the magistrate creates it, the people will love him—\nthis is the natural order of cause and effect.\n\nThus, extraordinary local calamities\nmust stem from those in power losing virtue—\nand this drought, defying *heaven*, is entirely deserved.\n\nYet *heaven’s* heart is supremely benevolent,\nslow to punish evil to allow repentance,\nand swift to reward goodness to encourage virtue.\n\nThere are also the appropriate urgencies of *yin* and *yang*:\nhidden virtue is delayed to await accumulation and magnify its reward,\nwhile hidden evil is swiftly met to demonstrate *heaven’s* response and confirm its retribution.\n\nFor *yang* is known to all,\nwhile *yin* is known only to *heaven*.\nThough there are differences in urgency,\nthere is not the slightest error.\n\nWhen intent is absolute and aligned,\nit is not *heaven* that calls—\nbut the person who summons their own fate.\"*\n\nThus, when one defends their position, the mountains of rice and flour collapse in an instant, towering twenty zans high—\ntheir crimes are as vast as mountains and valleys, beyond reckoning!\n\nWhen feeding dogs, the roosters are already clenched-mouthed, slow-mouthed,\nlong-tongued or short-tongued, behaving like beasts and accumulating sins too deep to purge!\n\nWhen offending others, the golden chains remain unbroken, yet a single lamp’s flame\ncannot be extinguished—its punishment knows no end!\n\nYet still, one evil deed can corrupt a hundred virtues,\nwhile one act of goodness can redeem a hundred evils.\n\nThe Four Heavenly Masters addressed the Great Sage with a smile and said:\n*\"This matter can only be resolved through goodness.\nIf you but turn your heart from evil to good,\nshaking the heavens above,\nthen the mountains of rice and flour will topple at once,\nthe chains and rods will break without delay—\ngo and persuade him to repent, and blessings will follow naturally.\"*\n\nFor evil and virtue both originate from oneself—\nto abandon evil and embrace virtue lies solely in one’s own hands.\nIf only one sincerely reflects and turns toward goodness,\nthen evil can be transformed into virtue,\ncalamity into fortune.\n\nThe Dragon King cannot act out of favor,\nthe Great Sage cannot act out of strength,\nnor can the heavens force a man—\nonly the three signs of warning are shown to admonish.\n\nIf he truly repents with earnest heart,\nbroadly cultivating hidden virtue,\nthen the fierce flames shall turn to sweet dew,\nthe star-mountains shall crumble into drifting clouds;\nthe rooster’s tongue of retribution shall be silenced,\nthe dog’s tongue of blame shall be cut short;\nfire shall cease to blaze,\nthe cords of punishment shall dissolve into nothingness.\n\nIn an instant, the heavens descended sweet rain,\neach drop falling without fail—how swift its arrival!\nThe spirits and deities also parted the clouds and mists,\neach revealing their true form.\n\nIt moves the heavens and earth,\nstirs the ghosts and gods—\nis this not wrought by a single change of the virtuous heart?\nThus, the temple is named **\"Sweet Rain Universal Salvation Monastery.\"**\n\nIn the pursuit of the Elixir,\nthose who do not repent and cultivate hidden virtue\nare like cooking sand for rice or using bamboo to point at the moon—\ntheir efforts shall never bear fruit!\nHow then does it earn the name **\"Universal Salvation\"?**\n\nYet the Sage Master holds a profound secret,\nconcealed within the transitions of this chapter.\nThe previous chapter expounded the emptiness of all phenomena;\nenlightenment of the heart and true nature—\ninner and outer as one, subtly perfect and harmonious—\nis already the Buddha’s presence in this land.\nWhere else might one labor to attain?\n\nThe woodcutter said, *\"That great path lies not far to the west.\"*\nWhy then is this not a resting place,\nbut rather a waypoint still traversed?\nFor accumulating virtue and refining power\nis merely the work of those in the early stages of cultivation—\nwhy speak of it when enlightenment and clarity are already attained?\nYet few know of the wondrous Dao residing between.\n\nObserve the opening verse:\n*\"The Great Dao is profound and subtle—\nhow can it be fathomed?\nIt embraces the cosmos,\nsplits the hidden gateways—\nits joy surpasses all in the world.\nThe spirit soars before the sacred peak,\na gem plucked from its treasure,\nradiant with fivefold brilliance.\nPiercing through heaven and earth,\nall beings above and below—\nthe wise live as long as mountains and seas.\"*\n\nThese words encapsulate the essence of the Elixir’s purpose;\neven the ghosts and gods are startled by its revelation.\nHow much more so for mortals?\nThus, it is not spoken aloud.\nOnly when the nature-body is firm\ncan one refine the Elixir;\nonly when hidden virtue is deep\ncan one perfect the Elixir.\nThe Dao of the Elixir is wondrous yet unfathomable in this way.\n\nThe ancient Master Maopu (鸠摩罗什) often sighed,\n*\"If only the fragrance of the scriptures could be written with ink to make the Great Vehicle,\nthe Abhidharma would not be inferior to the teachings of Kāśyapa!\"*\nNow that those who deeply understand are few,\nwhat remains to be expounded?\n\nThe ancients did not wish to reveal it,\nlest the ghosts and gods be startled—\nthis is the same principle.\nIn the **Eighty-Eighth Chapter**, *\"The Zen Reaches Jade Fluid and the Law Assembly\"*\n*\"The Monkey-Spirit and Wooden Demons Instruct the Disciples,\"*\nMaster Wùyī (悟一子) said:\n*\"This reveals the Great Dao—\nit must be transmitted by a teacher.\nTo hoard the Dao is to obstruct the heavenly Way;\nto reveal it lightly is to profane the heavenly treasure—\none must truly understand this.\"*\n\n**\"Jade Fluid\"** refers to the Elixir of returning Jade Nectar.\nAt this stage, the nature-body is perfected;\nto withhold transmission, leaving none to follow,\nis the selfishness of obstructing the path.\nIf transmitted to the unworthy,\nand the secrets are carelessly divulged,\ndisaster shall surely befall the one who does so.\nThe chapter’s teachings are most awakening and urgent.\n\nWhen the Three Treasures (三藏) reached Jade Fluid,\nhe instructed his disciples:\n*\"Be cautious—\ndo not be reckless!\"*\nThis clearly shows the meaning of not revealing lightly.\n\n**\"Eight Precepts bowed his head,\nSand Monk covered his face,\nPilgrim supported the Master.\"**\nEven so, they still could not help but exclaim in unison:\n*\"We have only seen high monks who subdue dragons and tame tigers—\nnever one who subdues pigs and tames monkeys!\"*\n\nFor the world knows only of dragons and tigers\nas the effects of cultivation,\nyet never understands what dragons and tigers truly are,\nnor the merit of subduing them.\nThey do not know that pigs and monkeys\nare but other names for dragons and tigers—\nand when suddenly revealed,\nhow could they not be startled in doubt?\n\nThe **Monkey** (申猿) is the Elixir of Metal-Water,\nthe **Pig** (亥猪) is the Elixir of Wood-Fire,\nand the **Sand** (沙) and **Precepts** (戒) represent the central Earth—\nthis is the principle of the Five Phases converging.\nReaders unaware of its subtlety\nmistake it for the restless monkey-spirits of the heart,\nand dismiss the Sand and Precepts families as insignificant—\ntheir understanding is no different from those who have never seen a monk subduing pigs and taming monkeys.\n\nThe world flees at sight,\nstumbling and crawling,\never fearful of avoiding it too little—\nyet who knows that through fourteen cycles of cold and heat,\ncountless evils and demons,\nthey have endured untold suffering\nbefore attaining the precious formula?\n\nThis treasure is not easily won—\nworthy of being learned by kings and nobles—\nyet if its brilliance is too shallow,\nand one boasts of selling it,\none shall be deemed frivolous.\nThe scriptures say:\n*\"Clad in coarse robes yet holding jade within.\"*\n*\"If empty, if foolish.\"*\nThe Ancestors taught with great care—\nnot from selfishness or vanity.\nFor a lone string plays no harmony,\nstartling the crowd and shocking the wise;\nfew are the connoisseurs who respond,\nand fewer still are those who benefit—\nmost only lose themselves.\nHow could one not be cautious?\n\nWithin the chapter, **\"暴纱亭\"** is revealed—\na sign of shallow, boastful display.\n**\"标窃神兵\"** warns of the danger of flaunting and deceiving others.\n**\"暴\"** means to proclaim;\n**\"纱\"** means light and frivolous;\n**\"亭\"** means a temporary stop.\nIf one carelessly reveals the secrets,\nthe curious shall seize the opportunity,\npretending to follow while exploiting the openings.\n\nSee how the Prince and the palace officials\nwere alarmed by the monk’s grotesque appearance,\nbegging him to go to **暴纱亭** to eat alms.\nThis is but a monk of outward form—\none who does not recognize his inner treasure’s worth,\nand thus is not sincerely invited to dwell as a revered teacher,\nbut rather treated as a transient guest at an inn.\n\nWhen the Prince boasted of his own prowess,\nand the Three Disciples excelled in their arts,\nthe rooster’s cackle grew ashamed of its small cage,\nthe frog in the well felt the limits of its vision.\n*\"The father and son prostrated themselves in worship,\nwhile Pilgrim coldly observed from the side.\"*\nThis was the assembly where the Law could be applied—\nwhy not then enact a grand salvation\nright at **暴纱亭**?\n\nFor there are teachings that must be kept secret,\nand those that may be revealed without concealment.\nZen is the **Sramana’s** (沙门) method—\nthe **Sramana’s** (沙) teachings can be openly shared,\nyet to guide beings toward liberation,\nfor those who chase after fame and profit,\nor are weary from the labors of the world,\nit must serve as a resting place and refuge.\n\nThe **elixir of jade nectar and return-to-origin** is the marvelous Dao/Way of awakening the mind and seeing true nature.\n\nThe **jade brilliance** of its splendor outshines the **fuxia** (甫华) and **gong** (衮) robes,\nthe **jade hue** of its luster surpasses the **qiang** (嫱) and **shi** (施) beauties;\nthe **jade essence** of its enduring nature is sturdier than the tripod or bell.\n\nAll possess it, each household holds it—\nthus, no need for eager exhortation to entice,\nnor for frantic efforts to rescue.\n\nThose who return are not hindered by waiting for an invitation,\nand seekers are not delayed by anger before guidance begins;\nchildren are not burdened by my brevity,\nand the reckless are not burdened by my indulgence.\n\nIt can be the **unsummoned** true friend of all beings,\nand the **owner** of the Four Dependencies and Ten Stages.\n\nUnlike the **golden elixir of return-to-origin**, passed down only once in ten thousand aeons,\nwhich must be kept secret and never revealed.\n\nThese three monks, within the **violent-silk pavilion’s** quiet chamber,\non the same day accepted disciples,\nreceived the **divine transmission** of the **Sramana’s** (沙门) teachings,\nand **circulated the cosmos** through their **mystic energy**—\nthis is called the **open transmission** of the **Sramana’s** (沙) Law,\nno more than external tools like weapons and martial prowess.\nTheir **subduing-pig, taming-monkey** (降猪伏猴) hidden marvels\nwere never uttered aloud or exposed in plain sight.\n\nThe **eight precepts’** stake and mallet weigh **5,048 jin** (斤) in total,\na single **treasure’s** measure.\nThe **Sramana’s** (沙) staff also weighs **5,048 jin**,\nalso a single **treasure**—\nno difference in principle.\n\nThe **lonely wanderer’s** (独行者) rod weighs **13,500 jin**,\nfor it has already encompassed the **three treasures’** total,\nyet it lacks the **three-five** (三五) harmonious perfection.\n\nThis tool can be replicated in form,\nbut must never be abandoned day or night—\nin the **Buddhist** tradition, it is called the **\"subduing-demon staff\"** (降魔杵),\nin the **Daoist** tradition, the **\"wise sword\"** (慧剑),\nand in the **Confucian** tradition, the **\"righteous cleaver\"** (刚断).\nIt is an innate **intelligence**, a **treasure** for safeguarding truth and banishing evil—\nnever to be parted from for an instant.\nThus, **\"a million rays of crimson light pierce the heavens,\na thousand streams of auspicious qi illuminate the earth.\"**\n\nIf one does not **return the spirit** and **abandon the body**,\nbut instead **departs for a moment**,\none will fall prey to **external demons**.\n\nHence, **\"when left in the straw shed for three days,\"\nit was swept away by the **devouring jaws of the tiger and leopard** (豹头虎口).\n\nThe Prince, having received his teacher’s transmission,\nhis **original spirit** (元神) returned to its source,\nhis **shedding of the old self and rebirth** (脱胎换骨) complete—\nlike the dead revived—\nnow wields the **divine weapon**.\n\nThus, it is evident that the **Zen school’s** teachings,\nonce reaching the **jade brilliance** stage,\nare sufficient to **enlighten ordinary beings**,\nand **broadly manifest compassion**.\n\nThose who have not yet glimpsed its **gate**,\nyet **borrow the guise of a head monk** (头陀),\nand **spread long-winded doctrines** (长舌),\nare indeed the **later tiger and leopard jaws** (豹头虎口).\n\nThe **eighty-ninth installment**:\n*\"The Yellow Lion Spirit falsely convenes the stake and mallet assembly,\nthe gold, wood, and earth demons stir up chaos at Tiger’s Mouth Mountain.\"*\n**Wùyī Zǐ** (悟一子) said:\nThis describes the **yellow-crowned** (黄冠) sect,\nwho **usurp the Daoist name**,\nand bring upon themselves **misfortune from presuming without a teacher**.\n\nBefore the **jade brilliance** (玉华) assembly was held,\nit was **ancestral transmission**—\ntrue knowledge and genuine power—\nhence called the **\"authentic Law assembly\"** (施法会).\nThis **stake and mallet** (钉钯) assembly,\nhowever, is **false and teacherless**—\nself-asserted, arbitrary—\nthus called the **\"empty assembly\"** (虚设会).\n\nThe phrase **\"Tiger’s Mouth Mountain, Leopard’s Head Cave\"** (豹头山虎口洞)\nclearly reveals those who **devour and indulge** in such teachings,\npretending to be **divine immortals**,\nyet unaware of their own **wicked nature**.\n\nTheir **headgear** is the **Daoist cap** (道冠),\nyet in truth, it is the **leopard’s head** (豹头);\ntheir **utterances** are **Daoist speech** (道言),\nyet in truth, it is the **tiger’s jaws** (虎口).\n\nTo generalize:\n**Long sashes and short staffs** (长绦短麈) mimic the **master’s trimmed tail** (师剪尾) arrogance;\n**Patched robes and straw sandals** (衲服芒鞋) imitate the **spotted and tattered** appearance.\nThey **entrap the fox** (绥狐) with **sharp claws** (利爪),\nstoring **nightly seduction** (夜夜之娇) in their **gourd** (葫芦);\nthey **seize the green serpent** (青蛇) with **bared fangs** (张牙吻),\nconcealing **clinking daggers** (铮铮之匕) in their **pouch**.\nThey **follow the traces of Master Zhang** (杖远公),\nyet **do not hear the Three Mysteries** (三藐不闻);\nthey **wear the coarse robes of Master Damo** (着达摩之农),\nyet **have not yet understood the One** (一归未解);\nthey **recite the sutras of Master Bolu** (诵波罗之经),\nyet **deceit proliferates** (诡谲丛生).\n\nTheir **cushion** (蒲团) serves as the **den of a cunning hare** (狡兔之窟),\ntheir **alms bowl** (钵盂) seeks the **land of drunken ease** (酣蘖之乡).\nThey **linger in the Jeta Grove by day** (祗园),\nand **haunt the Flower Market at night** (花市),\n**bodily a monk** (身比丘),\nyet **in heart, a thief like Jié** (心盗跖).\nHow different can this be?\n\nIn the chapter, the Prince remarked:\n*\"People say there are immortals in the cave.\"*\nPilgrim replied:\n*\"It must be this region’s wicked fiend.\"*\nA single word **pierced the deceitful’s vitals** (湛奸人肺腑),\nproving that those who **deceive the world**,\ncan be **exposed by the vulgar**,\nyet cannot **fool the wise**.\n\n*\"Seeing two wolf-headed demons,\nthey spoke clearly: ‘Our great king has been fortunate these days—\nlast month, he obtained a beautiful woman,\nwho lingers in the cave, bringing him great joy;\nlast night, he also acquired three kinds of weapons,\ntruly priceless treasures;\ntomorrow, he will host a feast\nto celebrate the **stake and mallet assembly** (钉钯会)!’\"*\n\nThe mind’s pure contemplation, where *samādhi* and *prajñā* are inseparable,\nis the Buddha’s void and luminous form—\nthe *dharma*’s subtle radiance.\nThe void of the Buddha is also the void of the *dharma*,\nthe void of the *saṅgha*—the mind itself abides.\nAbiding in the three voids’ treasure,\nthis is also called the **Three Refuges**.\n\nThus it is said: the **Three Jewels**—Buddha, *Dharma*, *Saṅgha*—\nare verified by the mind itself,\nnot borrowed from without.\nHow could they be seized and obtained?\n\nThe Yellow Lion stole the Three Jewels in secret,\nrejoicing in his private heart.\nYet he rejoiced only in the **stake and mallet**,\nnot in the golden cudgel or jewel-staff—\nnot only did he fail to grasp the Three Jewels’ subtlety,\nhe did not even recognize what the **stake and mallet** were!\nPerhaps he saw the mallet’s teeth resemble claws,\nthinking them useful for sharpening his ferocity—\nworthy of celebration, indeed!\n\nTo call it the **\"Stake and Mallet Assembly\"**\nwas but to gather his claws and fangs,\na hollow display of might.\n\nTo take pleasure in a beautiful woman\nis to wield an axe against one’s nature;\nto feast over the stake and mallet\nis to plant the roots of self-destruction.\nGiven to lust and drunkenness,\nforming factions and boasting of fame—\nneither monk nor Daoist,\nhe flaunts grand deeds.\nEven the **Maitreya** and **Laozi** would surely\nmanifest as **Vaiśravaṇa** in wrath,\nwielding a flying demon-slaying blade,\nto annihilate him instantly.\n\n*\"Only two small demons went east to buy swine and sheep.\"*\nThe **Qian** hexagram is where all yang originates,\nyet to send small demons to buy swine and sheep—\nhow absurd their mistake!\nThis stems from their arrogance by nature,\nseeking no true teacher,\nonly skilled in plunder and deceit.\nThey presume their cleverness surpasses all,\ntheir wisdom piercing the four directions—\nyet they reveal only cunning and eccentricity,\neccentricity and cunning.\n\nEight Rules transformed into cunning and eccentricity,\nPilgrim into eccentricity and cunning,\nSandy the Monk disguised as a swine-and-sheep merchant—\nthough called a scheme,\nit is truly **speaking the Dao**.\n\n**\"Calculation\"** (*jì*)—\nthe union of **\"speech\"** (*yán*) and **\"ten\"** (*shí*).\nThe principle of east three, south two,\nnorth one, west four, and the center’s ten.\n\nPilgrim, as **Metal-Water**,\nholds yang within yin—\nthus his transformation into **eccentricity and cunning**,\nwhere cunning lurks within eccentricity.\nEight Rules, as **Wood-Fire**,\nholds yin within yang—\nthus his shift into **cunning and eccentricity**,\nwhere eccentricity hides in cunning.\nSandy the Monk, as **Central Earth**,\nborrows from the four directions and thrives—\na guest of all yang,\nin accordance with the **Luo River Diagram’s** logic.\n\nThey feigned pretense; we acted with true calculation.\nTo strike falsehood with truth—\nhow could it fail to be exposed?\n\nWhen traced to his origin,\nhe was the **Golden-Haired Lion**,\na disciple of the **Nine Spirits’ Patriarch**.\nAh!\nHaving shattered their hollow guesses,\nthey now awaken to wisdom.\n\nThe two cunning ones\nhave already settled into their dual forms—\nboth body and mind.\n\nA single invitation—\nplainly a confession of guilt.\n\nThe Nine Spirits’ Patriarch wasted his divine thought,\nyet it was the Three Monks’ staff-shouts that broke the spell.\nFour-Ming’s blade could not sever the root of delusion—\nhow then escape the endless wheel of rebirth?\n\nGold, Wood, Earth—\nthe Five Radiant Yang Deities—\ntheir Dao/Way,\nyet they speak of *\"playing with empty tricks to deceive my treasure\"*?\n\nThe Golden-Haired Lion’s countless deceits,\nhis fake Fox-Dharma tricks—\nno escape from sweeping the cave and burning the nest,\nno fleeing to beg his master’s rescue.\n\nBamboo-Node Mountain—\nnode by node, hollowly transparent—\nyet only secretly piercing emptiness;\nNine-Twist Cave—\ntwist by twist, intricately deceptive—\nyet merely winding and groping in circles.\n\nLion’s head, lion’s tail, tangled and wild—\nnot a thread of truth remains;\nLion Patriarch, lion descendant—\nchaos and clamor—\nall half-hearted schemes.\n\nAh!\nFutile scheming—\nwhat use is it?\n\nThe Nine Spirits may command all lions,\nworthy of being called *Lion Patriarch*,\nyet not *Patriarch Master*.\n\nThough thoughts multiply,\nwhat good are they?\n\nThe *Analects* say:\n*\"To ponder without benefit is not as good as learning.\"*\nThe *Sutra* declares:\n*\"Without a teacher’s guidance,\neven deep contemplation leads to the void of heaven’s gods.\"*\n\nSelf-made delusions blind the innate wisdom—\npitiable, indeed!\n\nHere, the Three Monks are clearly marked as Gold, Wood, Earth—\ntheir \"monkey-mind, horse-will\" theory\noriginates from self-made delusions!\n\n---\n**Ninety-First Chapter: The Lion-Teacher’s Transmission—Same Root, Different Branches**\n**The Thief of Dao/Way Entangles Zen, Calming the Nine Spirits**\n\nA sage once said:\n*\"This passage’s Dao/Way is profound and unfathomable—\neven the Immortal Sage’s brush cannot exhaust its meaning,\nleaving no choice but to end here.\"*\n\nAs for those who scrutinize and analyze,\nexhausting thought and insight,\nyet grasp only its surface—\nsuch cases need not be discussed.\n\nEven Li Zhi of Zhuo-Wu, upon reading the closing lines,\n*\"Sudden escape from all thoughts, quieting the mind for true fruit,\"*\nknew the Nine Heads as Nine Thoughts,\ndividing until thoughtlessness—\nseemingly grasping the marrow,\nyet still only the surface?\n\nThe outline states:\n*\"The Lion-Teacher’s transmission—same root, different branches;\nThe Thief of Dao/Way entangles Zen, calming the Nine Spirits.\"*\n\nThose who truly awaken interpret the first half:\n*\"Lion\"* is *\"thought\"*—\n*\"Lion-Teacher\"* is *\"self-made delusion.\"*\n*\"Transmission\"* is *\"passing on\"*—\n*\"transmission and reception\"* is *\"passing and receiving.\"*\n\nSelf-made delusion in enlightenment,\nand receiving the Dao/Way through transmission—\nthough differing in effort,\nthey ultimately converge.\n\nInterpreting the latter half:\n*\"Thief of Dao/Way,\"*\n*\"entangling Zen,\"*\n*\"calming the Nine Spirits\"*—\nterms for gradual and sudden methods,\nfurther illustrating their convergence—\nalready surpassing Li’s understanding,\nyet still only the surface?\n\nEven the insightful say:\n*\"Lion-Teacher\"* is merely *\"self-made delusion\"*—\nthe Dao/Way cannot be obtained through it;\n*\"transmission and reception\"* is *\"teaching\"*—\nthe Dao/Way cannot be gained without enlightenment.\n\nThe error of self-made delusion\nand the flaw in mere teaching\nare the same.\n\nThe latter half:\nThe Dao/Way cannot be stolen,\nZen cannot be entangled,\nnor can the Nine Spirits be stilled.\n\nTo seek enlightenment without awakening\nis *\"stealing the Dao/Way\"*;\nto grasp the Dao/Way through self-made delusion\nis *\"entangling Zen.\"*\n\nThe failure of *\"Lion-Teacher’s transmission\"*\nis like *\"stealing the Dao/Way, entangling Zen,\"*\nyet still hoping to calm the Nine Spirits into unity—\nhow could this succeed?\n\nThis has advanced beyond the surface,\nyet still fails to reach the marrow.\n\nThe true path is:\n*\"Lion-Teacher\"* is merely *\"self-made delusion\"*—\nlions cannot be imitated;\nonly through a true teacher’s transmission\ncan one’s thoughts align in unity.\n\nWhy cannot thoughts be imitated?\nOnly through a true teacher’s transmission\ncan thoughts avoid error and converge.\n\nYet what law is transmitted?\nWhat meaning is received?\nThis remains unsolved—\nwords cannot exhaust it.\n\nIn the past, the Tathagata Shakyamuni\ndwelled in the world for eighty years,\nteaching countless heavenly and human beings,\nvoice-hearers, and bodhisattvas.\n\nHe expounded the Five Precepts, Eight Precepts,\nmajor and minor Vinaya,\nthe Four Noble Truths,\nTwelve Links of Dependent Origination,\nperfection of wisdom,\nfour immeasurables,\nthree knowledges and six powers,\nthirty-seven factors of enlightenment,\nthe ten directions,\nfour fearlessnesses,\neighteen unique laws,\nconventional truth,\nultimate truth,\ncountless liberations,\nsamadhi and dhāraṇī gates,\nbodhisattva nirvana,\neternal dharma-nature,\nornamenting Buddha-lands,\nsaving sentient beings,\nguiding bodhisattvas,\nall wondrous methods—\ntruly vast and exhaustive,\nencompassing the dharma-realm without bounds,\npenetrating the nature-ocean without limit,\ngradual and sudden methods left nothing omitted.\n\nYet in the end, he privately transmitted the *True Dharma-Eye* to Mahākāśyapa,\nordering ancestral succession,\na separate path in the world—\nthe *\"special transmission outside scriptures,\"*\nbeyond what the world could see or hear.\n\nThis was not to favor Kāśyapa over voice-hearers and bodhisattvas,\nbut because this law is the root of all sentient beings,\nwhat all Buddhas realize,\ntranscending all reason,\nfree from all phenomena,\nincapable of being grasped by speech, intellect, or analysis—\nhidden from all speculation, visible or subtle.\nOnly heart-to-heart transmission,\nseal-to-seal resonance,\ncan one self-attest to its luminous fruition.\n\nAncestor to ancestor, secretly revealing profound truths—\noriginally not something to be imitated through self-made delusion,\nseized by force, or stolen.\n\nYet the Dao/Way is inherently within nature—\nit cannot be stolen,\nthough the mystery of *\"stealing the Dao/Way\"*\nlies precisely in the *True Dharma-Eye’s* singular transmission,\nbeyond thought or imitation.\n\nThe *Yin-Shu Jing* says:\n*\"Its thieving mechanism—\nno one in the world can see,\nno one can know.\"*\n\nMaster Lu said:\n*\"To pilfer the mechanism of Heaven and Earth,\nto steal the vital qi of the Middle Void.\"*\n\nThus, the Dao is indeed obtained through this very act of theft.\n\nThe true teacher’s transmission\ntransmits not only the Dao\nbut also the Dao of *stealing the Dao*.\nThis *stealing of the Dao* is no ordinary Dao.\nHence it is said:\n*\"The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.\"*\nIt cannot be named or symbolized,\ncannot be conveyed through words.\n\nYet if the Dao can be stolen,\nthen can Zen not also be entangled?\n\nHaving already *\"stolen the Dao,\"*\nwhy then speak of *\"entangling Zen\"*?\n\nZen is true emptiness—\nif one is entangled within it,\nit is like two cords twisted together,\nimpossible to unbind.\nWhat purpose does *\"entangling Zen\"* serve?\n\nThe subtlety of *\"stealing the Dao\"*\nlies precisely in the profound constraint of the Dharma-limit,\nthe essence of still contemplation and unity.\n\nFor solitary contemplation alone cannot *\"steal the Dao,\"*\nnor can exclusive Zen practice achieve still contemplation.\n\nThe art of *\"stealing the Dao\"*\nresides in the authenticity of *transmission and reception*,\nnot in the delusion of *\"teacher-lion\"* posturing.\n\nThe art of *\"entangling Zen\"*\nlies in what follows *\"stealing the Dao,\"*\nnot in mere still contemplation.\n\nIf one takes still contemplation as Zen,\nthey disturb Zen with stillness,\nfalling into void and emptiness—\nnot true Zen.\n\nIf one uses Zen to probe the Dao,\nthey chase the Dao with thought,\nlacking the true seed within—\na false Dao.\n\nThe Nine Spirits have no way to stillness,\nand the *\"teacher-lion\"* is but empty fabrication,\nnot the true transmission of the master.\n\nThus, *\"stealing the Dao\"*\nis the foundation for stilling the Nine Spirits,\nwhile *\"entangling Zen\"*\nis the culmination of *\"stealing the Dao\"*—\nbeyond what pen and ink can fully explain.\n\nThis is the Dharma of the True Dharma-Eye,\nfixed and unheard by most.\n\nIts essence lies in first knowing\nthe Nine Spirits as one’s own self,\nthe six desires harming the body as the six lions encircling front and back,\nwith the green-faced trickster leading them,\nand the nine-headed one as their commander,\narrayed in the *Kan* palace—\nthen the primordial yang sinks and cannot rise again.\n\nWhat relies on the three monks’ true Five Phases\nclashing fiercely is but a draw of equal strength.\nOnly the灵心’s transformation,\nwith intent following the heart’s turn,\ncan avoid being bound.\n\nYet the Nine Spirits’ roots come from Heaven—\nonce thought and desire stir,\nthe entire host is ensnared.\nWhat is precious is preserving the heart to restrain desire,\ncalming the spirit,\nboldly penetrating the tiger’s den,\nuntil the Nine Spirits’ bamboo-jointed mountain’s nine winding caves—\nonly then does one grasp its depths.\n\nThe six senses are hard to sever,\nmost reluctant to abandon,\nso the old demon weeps unseen—\none must forcefully subdue the mind-monkey,\nfrom the start, like a great hammer striking\nafter a deep sleep in the brocade-cloud nest,\nuntil the true heart suddenly breaks through.\n\nOnce the true heart emerges,\nit naturally extinguishes the three corpses,\nfreely attaining liberation.\n\nIf one is agitated and startles themselves,\nand the desire-root secretly flares,\nthen they can still be controlled by it—\nfor they lack the sovereign to command it.\n\nOnly with utmost sincerity and discernment\ncan one uncover its true master\nand thus subdue it.\n\n*\"The Eastern Extreme’s Wondrous Rock Palace\"*\nis the realm of true nature.\n*\"Where the Lord of the Great Unity resides\"*\nis the Heavenly model to emulate.\n\nThe six lions cannot lurk within,\nthe nine lions cannot disturb.\n\nThe Lord of Heaven summons the **Qi-lion Disciple**—\nhis crime revealed: stealing the **Supreme Daoist’s** *Wheel of Rebirth* elixir,\nthree days lost in slumber, and thus straying from the **Nine Spirits’** source.\nNow he glimpses the subtlety of *\"Dao-Theft\"*—\nyet, before attaining stillness of thought.\n\nThe Lord of Heaven arrives at **Bamboo-Knot Mountain**,\ndeclaring: *\"The **Primordial Sage** is a spirit long refined by Dao,\npenetrating the Three Realms above,\ndescending to the Nine Abysses below.\"*\nThought, when perfected, becomes a Sage—\ntranslucent and boundless, past and future known,\nradiant and luminous, and thus is true.\n\nTo fail in recognizing the **One True** as sovereign,\nis to wander in false conjecture,\ndisturbed by chaotic delusions—\nthough luminous, it remains obscured.\n\nOnly when the **owner** is truly acknowledged,\nceasing all restless agitation,\nand returning to **primordial forgetfulness**—\nthen the marvel of *\"Ensnaring Zen\"* is realized,\nand the **Nine Spirits** are stilled.\n\nFor the **Master-Lion** cannot still the **Qi-Lion**,\nbut *\"transmission\"* may yet reveal *\"Dao-Theft\"*;\n*\"Dao-Theft\"* cannot be without *\"Ensnaring Zen\"*,\nbut *\"Ensnaring Zen\"* can still the **Qi-Lion** and lead to unity.\n\n*The **Awakening to Truth*** says:\n*\"At first, there is action—no one perceives,\"*\nthat is *\"Dao-Theft\"*;\nand again:\n*\"When true non-action dawns, all begin to know,\"*\nthat is *\"Ensnaring Zen\"*.\n\nTheft means **stealing**, ensnaring means **reveling**—\n*\"Dao-Theft and Ensnaring Zen\"*\nand the **Nine Spirits** merge as One!\n\nLet the Daoist student not be deceived\nby **false teachers** who **steal** their **alchemical tools**,\nnor burdened by the **Six Desires** that disrupt the Way—\nthen they may yet succeed!\n\nThe **Immortal Master** uniquely employs the **Violent Silk Pavilion**\nto subtly demonstrate his meaning—\nthus the lines: *\"Again to the Violent Silk Pavilion\"*,\n*\"—one transmission of instruction.\"*\n\nAt the start: *\"The **Blue-Faced Fiend** clings close to the **Nine-Headed Lion**,\"*\nshowing the **illusion of chaotic conjecture**,\nproclaiming: *\"The mind must be transmitted, never forced to guess!\"*\nThe **Blue Beast** is the **conjecture** itself.\n\nThe **True Person** declares:\n*\"Though your wisdom surpasses **Yan** and **Min**,\nwithout the True Master, do not force your guesses!\"*\nThus, the practitioner strikes down **doubt** with one blow—\nand **false subtleties** and **perverse insights** become mere **meat-pies***.\n\n**Yuhua** and **Jinping** are outer domains of **India**—\n**Yuhua** is the **elixir of jade**, where **Zen** reaches its peak,\nand **transmission of law** and **instruction to disciples** are both **royal****.\n\n*\"The **seventy-two kinds of solutions**\"*—\nthe meaning of **seventy-two critical moments**.\n\nThe **transmitted tools**:\n*\"A **staff of one thousand jin**,\n**pestle and rod each of eight hundred jin**\"*—\nthis is the **primordial qi of the First Heaven**,\nthe **Eight-Eights of the Azure Dragon’s** essence.\n\nHere lies the **\"Tiger-Maw Cavern\"**, mirroring below\nthe **\"Azure Dragon Mountain of Jinping Prefecture\"**—\nparallel imagery.\n\n**\"Jinping Prefecture\"** is the **elixir of gold**,\ndirectly opposed to **\"Yuhua\"**—\non the **fifteenth day of the first month**, when the moon is full,\nthe **qi of gold** is perfectly balanced.\n\nWith the **\"Azure Dragon Mountain\"** mirrored to this tale’s **\"Tiger-Maw Cavern\"**, again parallel.\n\n**Chapter 91: Jinping Prefecture’s Midwinter Lantern Festival**\n**Xuan Ying Cavern’s Tang Monk’s Deposition**\n\nThe **Awakened-to-One** says:\nThese next two chapters—**\"Jinping Prefecture\"**—\nstand in direct contrast to the previous three—**\"Yuhua Prefecture\"**—\n**\"Yuhua\"** represents the **inner Five Phases’** *law-symbols*,\n**\"Jinping\"** the **outer Five Phases’** *law-symbols*.\n\nThis uniquely clarifies the **fire-moments** of external alchemy—\nthey must not be missed!\nThus the **lantern festival** is used as an analogy.\n\n**Zi Yang True Person** says:\n*\"Lead meets **Geng**—quickly harvest the **mustache**,\nGold meets the **waning**—do not dare to taste!\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"Before the **first half of the month** and after the **second half**,\nThe **first half** of the **first half**—\nWhen the **drug’s flavor** is balanced, the **qi-symbol** is complete.\"*\n\n*\"Lead meets **Geng**\"*—the hour is **zi**.\n*\"Gold meets the **waning**\"*—the moon is **waning**.\n\nThe **first half** belongs to **yang**, the **second half** to **yin**—\nwithin **yin**, **yang** is balanced,\nyielding **eight liang of gold** from water’s depths,\nits flavor **balanced**, its **qi-symbol** **complete**.\n\nFrom the **third day** to the **fifteenth**, the **Three Yangs** are full—\nthe *law-symbol* is **《Kǎn》**—\nat this time, the **yin-essence water** is exhausted,\nthe **yang-essence gold** swells in its cycle,\nthus the **full moon**, pure **yang** without **yin**,\nhence the term **\"waning moon\"** is reversed.\n\nSpeaking of: **urgently** seizing the moment to work,\nnever delaying a **jǐ** or **kè**—\nlest the **Heavenly Opportunity** be lost!\n\n*\"The fifteenth day of the first month, Upper Element’s Festival—\nthe **Golden Lantern Bridge** with three **golden lanterns**,\"*\nwhen the **gold within water** is fully balanced—\none must **see clearly** and **act swiftly**.\n\n*\"Not before the third watch,\nor the wind will come,\"*\nmeaning the **yin-qi** has already surged,\nthe **fire-moment** has passed—\nnow it is **untastable**.\n\n*\"Four people herding three sheep,\ndescending from the **Western Slope**,\"*\nproclaiming the meaning of **\"Three Yangs’ Prosperity\"**—\nthe **West** is the **White Tiger’s** direction,\nwhere **yang** is born—\nwhen the time arrives, it comes,\nurgently demanding harvest.\n\n*\"Only because the **Master** relaxed his **Zen-nature**,\nresting at **Ci Yun Temple** to enjoy pleasure,\ndid the **prosperity peak** fail to arrive,\nand **joy’s extreme** give way to **sorrow**.\"*\nRevealing: beyond this **moment**, **yang** gradually yields to **yin**,\nand the **fire-moment** is **slightly missed**.\n\nThe **four** represent **year, month, day, and hour**—\nthe **eyes of the fire-moment**—\nwithout the **fire-eyes of golden clarity**, who can recognize?\n\n*\"**Ming Tian County**\"*—\nthe **meaning of weeping and wailing**.\n\n*\"Fragrant oil fills the nostrils,\nits worth is **precious and rare**,\nyet it is only lit for **three nights**\"*—\nwhen the moon rises in **yín**, it is **most precious and rare**,\nlike **people’s vital essence**—difficult to accumulate,\neasy to exhaust—\nnot to be **wasted** in ordinary pursuits.\n\nIf one fails to grasp its **rare and fleeting** signs,\nand mistakes a **false Buddha** for **true nature**—\ngreat **pity** indeed!\n\nSee how they fail to recognize the **Western Slope’s** joy,\nyet say: *\"Here, the virtuous folk,\nreading scriptures and chanting **Buddha**,\nall hope to cultivate and be reborn in **China**.\"*\n\n*\"It is further said, ‘Westward to the Soul Mountain, we have not yet gone.’*\nThis speaks of direction as if it were mere place—west or east—\nyet fails to grasp that west and east transcend mere locality.\nIt is as if one mistook the path’s beginning,\nand thus strayed from the true way.\n\nLike Tang Seng, who failed to discern the false,\nand bowed before a Buddha—\nhis error was his own alone,\nno blame upon others—\njust as his own confession attests.\n\nThe opening line—\n*‘Departing from Jade Flower City’*—\nreveals its bordering with Golden Plateau.\n\nObserve how idle wanderers,\nentering Ci Yun Temple to rest their horses,\ncall the abbot one who ‘leisurely nurtures ease,’\nand invite Tang Seng to ‘stay at leisure, to play awhile’—\nall describing the blind, careless squandering of time,\nhence their startled cry:\n*‘We’ve wasted the very light of days!’*\n\nThe text subtly embeds the lesson of *viewing lanterns on Yuan Night*\nto signify discerning the *fire-moment’s* urgency—\na meaning made plain.\n\nAs for *Averting Cold, Averting Heat, Averting Dust*,\nand the pretense of ‘oil offerings to the Buddha,’\nit lays bare a band of dissolute loafers,\nwho steal idle days in sham devotion—\nmistaking falsehood for truth,\nwhile life’s swift hours slip away.\n\nThe Pilgrim raged:\n*‘You thieving oil-mouthed demon!’*\n—truth recorded as fact.\n\nFor *‘oil’* is *‘wandering’*—\nas *‘sheep’* is *‘yang’*—\na cipher in this book’s hidden speech.\n\nYet *‘thieving oil’* reveals\nthe failure to grasp the fire-moment’s critical hour,\nand to seize what is past its time.\n\nOil belongs to water—*yin*.\nThe three tusks are *yin*-earth, things of water—also *yin*.\nTo steal by moonlight, when the time has passed,\nis to plunder *yin* with *yin*—\nhow could such ever be true?\nThus, a false Buddha.\n\nFor those who deeply know the fire-moment’s essence,\nyet seize it out of season, are thieves of the Dao.\nThose who fail to grasp its truth,\nand misuse it against its time—\nare thieves of oil.\n\nThe same act of theft,\nyet one true, one false—\nso vast the difference.\n\nSha Monk said, *“Lest we lose the chance.”*\nEight Rules said, *“Seize this moonlit hour to subdue demons.”*\nBoth speak to this same truth.\n\nLet the reader’s eye follow to the next chapter—\nwhere the Green Dragon Mountain looms,\nand deeper meaning awaits.\n\n**Chapter Ninety-Two**\n*The Three Monks Battle Green Dragon Mountain*\n*The Four Stars Seize the Rhinoceros Demon*\n\nA Disciple of Awakening says:\nThis clearly marks the theft of *yin* by *yin* as the false Buddha—\none must swiftly discern and destroy it,\nto root out deceit and restore truth.\n\nOil is pure *yin*-water, dregs unfit for use,\nsymbolizing the distant, useless *yin* within man.\nThe Three Rogues, under false names and sacred guise,\nbewitch the ignorant, claiming the Buddha’s heart requires oil,\nthat oil may nourish the Buddha—\nyet they waste only fat and feed delusion.\n\nLike those who seek the elixir but confuse *yin* and *yang*,\nand refine in error—\nhow far they stray!\n\nThe chapter begins with *“Green Dragon Mountain’s Mystic Cavern”*—\npointing to the black, murky *qi* of the earth.\n\nGreen Dragon is the east’s *yin* within *yang*—\nbright without, dark within—\nas when a man’s four great limbs are all *yin*,\nyet he knows not what is *yang* essence.\n\nOne must borrow a spark of *yang* light,\nturn it inward to illuminate,\nand drive back the host of *yin*—\nonly then does one abandon falsehood for truth,\nknow time and grasp the moment.\n\nHasten with keen discernment and fierce resolve,\nlest you mistake the path,\nand waste the chance!\n\nThus, the text explicitly begins with the words *“Great Battle”* to awaken the mind.\n\nThe practitioner transforms the Fire-Flame Insect to illuminate the cave,\nbeholding the demons with their doors shut, fast asleep—\nlike an endless night,\nis it not a block of sheer *yin*,\nakin to the black, dark abyss of hell,\nwithout distinction of day or night?\n\nThe Master Tang was in the dark, marveling at *“the different scene in the West”*,\nsaying, *“Now it is the first month,\nlantern bugs stir from their dormancy—\nwhy are there lantern bugs flying?”*\n\nThe commentator notes that though the Master Tang recognized the climate,\nhe did not realize that the Master Tang himself sat in ignorance of the climate.\n\nFor *yin* and *yang* have the principle of inversion,\nand advance and retreat know no fixed moment.\nThe scripture says:\n*“The Winter Solstice does not fall on the hour of Zi,\nthe morning and evening are but empty comparisons of Mao and You.”*\n\nIf one judges the flying of lantern bugs by the lunar calendar,\nit is as if taking midnight for the hour of Zi,\nand morning and evening for Mao and You—\na great error! A great error!\nHence, the practitioner urgently replies:\n*“Master! Because of your failure to discern truth from falsehood,\nyou have wasted so much time and expended so much effort!”*\n\nAlas! Such idle, cold words\nare enough to make those who mistake *yin* essence and lag in seizing the moment\nbreak out in a cold sweat.\n\nThe lantern’s glow appears only in darkness—\na *yang* within *yin*—\nif one could always turn the light inward,\nit would suffice to guide the lost.\n\nThe Master Tang’s astonishment at its untimely flight,\nand the False Buddha’s door-shut slumber,\nshare the same confusion—\nhow could they not confess their crimes?\n\nLocking them away in darkness,\nyet eager to escape—\nit is like covering one’s ears to steal a bell,\nhow could they hope to gain anything?\n\nSha Monk said:\n*“Could it be that they are harming my master in secret?”*\nThe foolish one said:\n*“Thieves stealing oil!”*\n\nEverywhere, their true nature is revealed—\ntruly awakening the mind.\n*“At this time, about the third watch,\nthe moon’s light in the sky is like daytime,”*\nyet why were the Eight Rules and Sha Monk bound?\n\nThe moon is a *yang* within *yin*,\nwhen *yin* qi moves with the moment,\nabandoning darkness for brightness,\nit gains the upper hand—\na subtle confirmation of the timing’s truth.\n\nBut the hour of Chou is the domain of earth,\nwood can subdue earth,\nso they should ascend to the East—\nyet why did the practitioner ascend to the West?\n\nUpon seeing the Great White Star of Metal,\nhe inquired into its origins,\nrevealing the strategy of tracing to the root—\nin the True Gold, he discerned its falsehood.\n\nIn the earlier capture at Jade Flower State,\nthe lion should have ascended to the West to meet the Tathāgata—\nyet why did it ascend to the East to meet the Lord of East Peak, the Marvelous Rock of the Supreme One?\n\nIn the True One, he settled the chaos.\nThe same principle applies:\nthe Jade Flower’s Tiger’s Maw Cave,\nthe Green Dragon Mountain of the Golden Plateau—\nboth display the marvel of inverted *yin* and *yang*,\nand reciprocal illumination.\n\n*“The half-rhino demon, barely formed,\ncan be subdued only by the four Wood-Beast stars.”*\nThe reader says that wood subdues earth\nis the common principle of the Five Phases,\nwith no deeper meaning.\n\nYet here we see the true distinction between reality and illusion.\n\nFor the Dao of true immortals,\ninverts the primordial *yang* of Heavenly Antiquity,\nand through fire refining gold, the true gold emerges—\nthe marvel of seeing lanterns on the New Year’s Eve.\n\nThe False Buddha’s demonic essence,\nfollows the *yin* of the later Heaven,\nand through wood subduing earth, the false earth collapses—\nthe error of lantern bugs flying at the third watch.\n\nThus, within the cave,\nhe rescued the Master Tang and his disciples,\ngathering many pearls, jade, gold, and treasures—\nwood aiding fire to purify the true gold,\nas pearls and jewels enhance their luster.\n\nEarth, injured by fire,\nstrips away the false earth clinging to the gold—\nlike the rhino’s retreat from its tracks.\n\nHence, the three rhinos fled for their lives,\ndaring not to enter the southern lands where fire thrives,\nbut instead plunging into the western seas where waters run deep—\nthey sought survival in the place where they were subdued,\nyet did not know that in fleeing life,\nthey sought death.\n\nSuch is the folly of ignorance and misapplication—\ncontrary, perverse, and erroneous.\n\nThe scripture says:\n*“Fire arises from wood,\ndisaster strikes when it is subdued.”*\nHarvesting *yin* to cultivate wood,\nthe disaster of fire burning oneself—\nthe Four Wood-Beast stars align with Tianpeng,\nthus their condemnation of the three rhinos is just,\ntruly knowing the clear principles of dharma and law—\nhow could they fail to punish according to the law?\n\nIt says:\n*“Oafish rhino demons,\ncloaked in hair and horn,\nunaware of the meaning of ‘Three Yangs Open Tai,’\nfoolishly boasting of the three rhinos’ ability to flee.\nLazy and thieving,\nthey deceive the masses to amass wealth.\nWith the False Buddha’s face,\nthey devour living souls,\nacting with cunning and deceit.\nRiding the demonic wind,\nthey drain vital essence,\nspreading their rampant chaos far and wide.\nThey grasp not the mechanism of growth and decay,\nnor the wisdom of retreat and approach.\nBurning their own nests,\nthey expose the law’s clarity—\nbeheading and dismembering,\nthey fulfill the people’s vengeance.”*\n\nHahaha!\n\nThe practitioner, having circled the **Golden Level Prefecture** ([金平府 *Jīnpíng Fǔ*]), issued a command midair—\nthe **True Law** ([真法 *Zhēnfǎ*]) thundered like rain, a spectacle all, wise or foolish, revered.\n\nMaster and disciple rose at the fifth watch,\nstealthily crossing **Chen Cang** ([陈仓 *Chéncāng*]—lit. \"Dark passage through Chen Cang\"),\nlest they be punished for their **reckless complacency** ([偷安错认 *tōu’ān cuòrèn*]) and stray from the path.\n\nFrom now on,\nthey must **hasten their cultivation** ([修行 *xiūxíng*])—\nno more delays!\n\n**Chapter 93**\n*At the **Giving Alone Garden** ([给孤园 *Gěigū Yuán*]), ancient tales are pondered, causes discussed,*\n*The **Chao King** ([朝王 *Cháowáng*]) of **India** ([天竺 *Tiānjú*]) meets with chance.*\n\nThe **Awakened One** ([悟一子 *Wùyī Zǐ*]) said:\n*\"This passage, from beginning to end, repeats itself time and again.\nAfter closing the scroll and deep reflection,\nI still cannot grasp its

How dare you say I never **explained** ([解 *jiě*]) it?\nDo *you* understand it?”*\nThe **Pilgrim** ([行者 *Xíngzhě*]) answered:\n*“I understand it.”*\nFrom then on, he made no further sound.\n\nReaders

*tú*]),\nwhile in the original,\nthe **disciple** ([徒 *tú*]) **transmits** ([授 *shòu*]) to the **Master** ([师 *shī*]).\nThis is the **reverse method of the Daoist path** ([仙道逆法 *Xiāndào nìfǎ*]),\nwith its own profound significance.\n\nWhen **Eight Rules** ([八戒 *Bā Jiè*]) pressed him to **explicate** ([解 *jiě*]),\n**Sha Monk** ([沙僧 *Shā Sēng*]) said:\n*“Big brother is spouting nonsense,\ntricking Master to move on.”*\nBoth were **unaware of the explanation** ([不知解者 *bù zhī jiě zhě*]).\n\nThus, **San Zang** ([三藏 *Sān Zàng*]) declared:\n*“Sun Wukong’s **explication** ([解 *jiě*]) is beyond words and letters—\nit is the **true explication** ([真解 *zhēnjiě*]).\nWhat is this **true explication** ([真解 *zhēnjiě*])?”*\n\nThe ancient Master of Nanquan instructed the assembly, saying:\n*\"The heart is not the Buddha, wisdom is not the Dao.\"*\n\nChen Nihuan remarked:\n*\"There is another layer of strangeness beyond strangeness—\nthe heart and kidneys are not the *Kàn-Lí* [坎离] of yin and yang.\nSpirit, soul, heart, mind, and qi—\nwhen observed, they seem real yet are ultimately not.\"*\n\nMaster Lü said:\n*\"The Four Great Elements [四大] of the body are all yin—\nwhere then does the yang essence reside?\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"Do not cling to this body as the Dao,\nfor solitary cultivation of a single thing is but solitary yin.\"*\n\nWhen Master Tí Lǎng asked Stonehead [石头], *\"What is the Buddha?\"*\nStonehead replied: *\"You have no Buddha-nature.\"*\n\nMaster Wúyè, of noble bearing, met Master Mazu, who said:\n*\"This grand Buddha Hall stands empty—\nwithin it, no Buddha dwells.\"*\n\nA monk asked Master Shànjué:\n*\"Does this dog still possess Buddha-nature?\"*\n*\"I am not a sentient being,\"* he replied.\n*\"If you are not a sentient being,\"* the monk pressed, *\"are you then the Buddha?\"*\n*\"No,\"* the master said.\n*\"Then what in truth are you?\"*\n*\"Nor am I a thing.\"*\n*\"Can it be grasped or perceived?\"*\n*\"Thought cannot reach it, analogy cannot grasp it—\nthus it is said to be beyond thought and comparison.\"*\n\nThough the nature of the *Xìngtán* [杏坛] is without limits,\nyet Master Zǐyú’s cultivation of qi is said to be difficult,\nfor he spoke of the sages of the Three Teachings\nnever taking the heart as the Dao,\nbut striving instead for the utmost in *géwù zhìzhī* [格物致知].\n\nIf one reads the *Heart Sutra* and claims *\"mind is Buddha,\"*\nthen one has failed to grasp the subtlety of *color-emptiness, emptiness-color*.\nIts profundity cannot be conveyed through words or letters—\nthus the Master *\"never spoke again.\"*\n\nYet neither is it *\"non-heart, non-Buddha,\"*\nfor it cannot be awakened by the mind alone—\none must await transmission from the Master before understanding.\n\nHence, when Jìgū’s nobleman paved the garden with gold\nto purchase the Jeta Grove,\nonly then could he invite the World-Honored One to teach—\nhow lightly such truths can be passed on!\n\nHow many scholars pore over these texts,\nyet their minds remain hollow—\nwho among them truly knows?\nDeeply lamentable!\n\nIf one takes these hollow, cold words\nand claims they are but the idle verse of poets Jia Dao or Bai Juyi,\nthen one’s understanding is shallow indeed!\n\nHe speaks of *\"Bǎijiǎo Mountain\"*—\na hidden warning that pure yin’s domain is no place for action.\nHe mentions *\"Jīmíng Pass\"*—\none must await the return of yang’s first stir.\n\n*\"At this moment, the crescent moon shines bright,\"*\nrevealing where the Dao/Way resides.\n*\"Suddenly, a Daoist arrives with news: ‘The Master has come.’\"*\n\nLed to the Jeta Grove where the World-Honored One taught,\nwalking beneath the moon’s glow, the heart still—\nwhen a voice, tragic and sharp, pierces the silence.\n*\"Tragic\"*—that is *\"non-heart\"*;\n*\"sharp\"*—the soil of *\"knife-and-pill\"*,\nnot of the heart, yet truly piercing.\n\nAh, the wonder of it!\n*\"The matter of this tragic cry\nis beyond even this Master’s clear discernment.\"*\nUnless one meets a monk like Tang Seng,\nno further words may be spoken.\n*\"It is beyond speech or letters—\nonly true understanding remains.\"*\n\n*\"Last year’s same day,\"*\nwhen the crescent moon shone bright—\n*\"at the very moment of clear nature’s illumination,\na gust of wind suddenly rose,\nand a voice, tragic and sharp, broke through.\"*\nUpon the Jeta platform stood\na maiden of exquisite beauty and grace.\n\nWithin this moonlit scene,\nthe World-Honored One’s teaching place\nsuddenly scattered heavenly flowers,\nsummoning celestial maidens—\nnot to be mistaken for demons or ill omens.\n\nHere, the Buddha had already bestowed\nthe True Dharma Eye upon Xuánzàng.\nThus, when the Three Pilgrims heard,\nthey grasped its profundity—\nto be held close in the heart.\n\n*\"Close\"*—that is *\"knife-and-pill\"* soil.\nAs the Master and disciples prepared to depart,\nthe old monk again urged the tragic matter,\nand the Pilgrim laughed in reply:\n*\"I understand! I understand!\"*\nThe transmission now clear,\njust as the flower was plucked and a smile exchanged.\n\nLike the crowing of the golden rooster,\nthey awoke suddenly—\nfree to take the great road,\npassing the pass unobstructed by Bǎijiǎo Mountain.\n\nFrom there, they pressed straight to the Golden City’s celestial treasury,\ntogether ascending the painted pavilion to watch the ball of embroidered silk.\n*\"Painted\"*—the five hues, the radiant colors of the Five Phases;\n*\"ball\"*—the Supreme Ultimate, the perfect union of yin and yang.\n\nTang Seng suddenly recalled:\n*\"My mother also cast the embroidered ball—\na fateful encounter that bound us in marriage.\"*\nAh, the wonder!\nFrom the very source of birth,\none awakens to this thread of destiny—\nthe original face itself.\n\nThe opening poem declares:\n*\"Whether becoming immortal or Buddha,\none must arrange it from here.\"*\nAlas! Who could fail to arrange it\nfrom the very place of one’s parents’ birth?\n\nThe false princess sought the monk’s true *qi*\nto become a celestial being;\nthe true monk could not be deceived by her,\nlest he fall into hell.\n\nThe Pilgrim’s ability to discern truth from falsehood\nis precisely his grasp of the *Heart Sutra*.\n\nThe Pilgrim devises the *\"leaning on marriage to summon demons\"* stratagem—\nTang Seng nods in silent understanding,\nwhile the King of India and the false princess remain unaware.\nEight Rules and Sha Wujing exchange playful banter,\nthe stationmaster’s words are upside-down—\njust as the *Lotus Sutra* warns:\n*\"If such matters are spoken of,\nall heavens and all people\nwill be filled with astonishment and doubt.\"*\n\nI have drawn out this lengthy tale,\nyet have not truly fathomed a single character of the *Heart Sutra*—\nno different from the Master’s *\"never speaking again.\"*\n\nOn that day, Tang Seng walked beneath the moon in the Jeta Grove,\nmet an old monk,\nand upon hearing the tragic cry, awakened.\n\nOh, reader—do not cling to the text in vain imaginings!\nCould you not also meet the old monk,\nstroll beneath the crescent moon’s light,\nand listen for the tragic cry?\n\n---\n**Ninety-fourth Chapter**\n*The Four Monks Feast in the Palace Garden*\n*A Monster Harbors Lustful Desire*\n\n**A Disciple’s Awakening:**\nThese next two chapters I did not wish to explain,\nfor fear that explanation would only deepen confusion.\n\nThe Buddha said:\n*\"If such matters are spoken of,\nall heavens and all people\nwill be filled with astonishment and doubt.\"*\nThat mortals should be astonished is due to their narrow vision—\nlet that pass.\nBut why should even the heavens be astonished?\nThen there must be matters truly astonishing and doubtful.\n\nThus, I refrain from explanation,\nlest I add to the confusion of others.\nSome may say this is but the fiction of *Meng Liang’s Plum Garden*,\nor the allegory of *Zhi Yuan’s Ink Garden*—\nyet they cannot fathom what is performed or what is concealed.\n\nTruly, to mock the book’s clear references—\nlike taking the jade hare and teasing it with the south wind—\nis a grave sin!\n\nLet us take the book’s most evident passages and explain them,\nso that astonishment and doubt may be set aside.\n\nAll have read *Journey to the West*—\nshould the *\"factor\"* in *\"discussing the factor\"* not be emphasized?\n*\"Factor\"*—that which gives rise.\n\nThis chapter discusses the *factor* before one’s parents’ birth,\nand the *factor* that follows birth.\n\nAll have read the *I Ching*—\nshould the *\"encounter\"* in *\"encountering偶\"* not be emphasized?\n*\"Encounter\"*—the yin line.\n\nThis chapter reveals:\n*Kàn* moving and falling into *Kūn*, forming *Kǎn*;\n*Kūn* moving and falling into *Kàn*, forming *Lí*—\nthe paired configurations.\n\nOn that day, the World-Honored One, with compassion for all beings,\nspoke of the *factor* in his teaching,\nfor those who would escape birth and death\nmust first know the *factor* of their birth,\nand only then may they learn to die.\n\nAs when treating illness—\none must first know the root of the disease\nbefore the proper remedy can be applied.\n\nThus, before entering the Jeta Grove, the *factor* was discussed,\nand before entering the Palace Garden, the *factor* was questioned.\nOnly through the subtlety of questioning the *factor* in the Palace Garden\ncan one truly grasp the principle of discussing the *factor* in the Grove.\n\nHence, I pause here to speak of the *factor* before birth.\n\nWhen Tang Seng reached the Golden Hall,\nthe king asked:\n*\"From where have you come, monk?\"*\n\n---\n\nThe king inquired: *\"Where did the three of you originate? What are their surnames and given names? Why did they take ordination? Which scriptures do they seek?\"*\n\nWas this not asking about the *factor* of their coming?\n\nThe monk replied: *\"Your Majesty asks of my coming *factor*—I shall now declare it.\"*\n\nWas this not asking about the *factor* of their coming?\n\nThe Pilgrim responded: *\"My father is Heaven, my mother Earth; once I paid homage to the Supreme Sage and mastered the Great Dao. It was only due to the chaos of the Peach Blossom Festival, where I rebelled against the Celestial Palace, that I was pressed beneath the Five-Phase Mountain.\"*\n\nWas this not the *factor* of their coming?\n\nEight Rules spoke: *\"All my life I was in confusion, until I met a true Sage. I diligently cultivated the twenty-four practices and reverently refined the sixty-six precepts. It was only because, drunk from the Peach Blossom Festival wine, I teased Chang'e, that I was banished to the mortal realm.\"*\n\nWas this not the *factor* of their coming?\n\nSand Rules said: *\"Fearful of rebirth, I encountered a celestial companion. I nurtured a child and completed the marriage of a maiden. It was at the Peach Blossom Festival gathering that I dropped a cup, shattering it, and was thus exiled to the Flowing Sands.\"*\n\nWas this not the *factor* of their coming?\n\nIf one does not recognize the *factor* of their coming, then the biographies of the Three Disciples are fully recorded in the earlier chapters—this repetition seems redundant and meaningless. Yet it reveals the root of the Great Dao, which must be unveiled in the World-Honored One’s teaching at the Golden Hall and clarified in the Palace Garden’s display of the Dao.\n\nThough the monk’s *factor* of coming has already been spoken of, the Pilgrim said: *\"Fortunate is my Master, who departed from the Eastern Lands to pay homage in the Western Realm.\"*\nEight Rules said: *\"I protect Tang Seng on his direct journey to the Western Heaven.\"*\nSand Rules said: *\"I follow the Buddhist disciple of the Tang Dynasty to the Western Heaven.\"*\n\nThis seems to restate the *factor* of their coming anew, yet it also reveals their original unity as Master and disciples.\n\nThe Three Disciples all originated from the Peach Blossom Festival, showing that their brothers were born from the same *qi*.\n\nOriginally, they were of the *Qián* (乾) nature—only when one moved did it become *one* (一), and when one *odd* (奇) changed into *pair* (偶), the true yang was submerged, giving rise to *Kūn* (坤), which then formed *Kàn* (坎), while *Qián* (乾) formed *Lí* (離). In this moment of confusion, the matching of yin and yang was achieved, and this is the true principle of the *factor* of their coming—they encountered the *pair*.\n\nIf earlier, the True Princess fell into the Golden Hall, a pure *Qián* (乾) place that became the *Lí* (離) configuration;\nthen the Three Tripitaka Master and disciples all arrived in the Palace Garden, within the *Kūn* (坤) realm, forming the *Kàn* (坎) symbol—this is the differing *factor* of their coming, yet still an encounter with the *pair*.\n\nThe profound meaning of this chapter cannot be fully exhausted.\n\nAs the Pilgrim said: *\"We ordained beings progress step by step.\"*\nNow, *\"discussing the factor\"* and *\"encountering the pair\"* may indeed be called *\"a step forward.\"*\n\nLet me further advance a step for all—do not be startled or doubtful at what the World-Honored One has said.\n\nThe True Princess is the transformed body of Tang Seng’s Three Disciples;\nTang Seng’s Three Disciples are the divided forms of the True Princess.\n\nWhy so?\n\nThe True Princess is *yang* within and *yin* without—though appearing as a female form, she is truly male.\nThe Three Disciples are *yang* without and *yin* within—though appearing as male forms, they are truly female bodies.\n\nThe *Awakening to Reality Chapter* states:\n*\"The sun residing in the *Lí* (離) position yet becomes female,\nthe moon paired in the *Kàn* (坎) yet is truly male.\nThose who do not grasp this inverted meaning\nshould not presume to speak loftily of worldly matters.\"*\n\nThis is the *factor* that can be endlessly discussed.\n\nLet the assembly advance yet another step: The False Princess is but the borrowed form of Tang Seng’s Three Disciples and the True Princess;\nTang Seng’s Three Disciples and the True Princess are likewise the borrowed forms of the False Princess.\n\nWhy so?\n\nA stir in the Heavenly Palace gives rise to wrath and desire,\na stir in the Moon Palace gives rise to wrath and desire—\nall from one movement, all one monstrous essence.\n\nBecause of the Moon Hare’s monstrous theft into the Yin Palace,\nit thus mingled into the Palace, thus overturned the Heavenly Palace,\nthus made it impossible to settle the outcome.\n\nYet the False Princess was not wrought by Jade Hare—\nit was all wrought by Tang Seng’s Three Disciples and the True Princess.\n\nTang Seng’s present fall into the *Kūn* (坤) Palace\nwas not wrought by the False Princess—\nit was all wrought by the Pilgrim’s rebellion against Heaven,\nself-inflicted.\n\nTang Seng’s present marriage to the False Princess\nwas not wrought by the False Princess—\nit was all wrought by Eight Rules’ drunken sport with Chang’e,\nself-invited.\n\nTang Seng’s present striking of the embroidered ball\nwas not wrought by the False Princess—\nit was all wrought by Sha Monk shattering the glass cup,\nself-struck.\n\nThe True Princess’s entrapment at the Cloth-of-Gold Temple\nwas not wrought by the False Princess—\nit was all wrought by Suo E’s single palm of worldly longing,\nself-trapped.\n\nThe Five Phases coalesce into one *qi*,\nthe Three Monks coalesce into one Monk—\ndivide their forms, and four may arise;\na myriad truths are but one truth,\none monstrosity becomes a hundred monstrosities—\nyet in essence, none but one.\n\nThus, the True Princess is again Tang Seng’s Three Disciples,\nTang Seng’s Three Disciples are again the True Princess.\nTang Seng’s Three Disciples and the True Princess\nare again the False Princess.\n\nToday’s ball-throwing and marriage invitations\nwere not wrought by the False Princess—\nthey were all wrought by Suo E’s single palm.\n\nThis is the *factor* that cannot be endlessly discussed.\n\nAdvance yet further: For men to seek women is the norm of propriety.\nWhy does the False Princess, as a woman, seek men as if marrying a bride?\nThis inversion has its cause.\n\nLet the assembly advance yet another step: All the thousand demons and hundred fiends across the hundred chapters\nare but one monstrosity—\nall wrought by the False Princess’s single monstrosity.\n\nAll the myriad trials and difficulties across the hundred chapters\nare but one movement—\nall wrought by the True Princess’s single palm.\n\nThe causes of true and false are indeed beyond clear distinction!\n\nThis comes from the \"meeting of pairs\" within the *factor*.\n\nThe assembly may wish to advance yet another step, yet fear touches upon matters that are startling and dubious—\nthus, one cannot but halt here.\n\nWithin the chapter:\n*\"The traveler, pondering the elder’s words, proceeds to investigate true and false.\"*\n\nHe declares:\n*\"If she is a true woman, then you shall become a son-in-law.\"*\nAgain he says:\n*\"At the wedding ceremony, let us all cause a commotion and take her away.\"*\n*\"Master and disciple shall follow one another without a moment’s separation.\"*\nAll are but expressions of the intent to clarify cause and effect,\nand to seek liberation through self-understanding.\n\nThe *\"Hall of Pacifying Flowers\"* must clarify the true nature of gold,\nwhile the *\"Pavilion of Retaining Spring\"* must clarify the falsity of lingering.\nMan lingers in Spring, ascending to Pacify Flowers—\none must discern the true through the false;\neach partakes in feasting, compelled to rejoice—\nagain, the false responds to the false.\n\nIn spring, summer, autumn, and winter,\none should forget emotions by aligning with the scene—\nwithin the false, there lies the true;\nat joyous gatherings of auspicious times,\nthough one may lead and the other follow,\nwithin the true, there lies the false.\n\nCupping wine and sleeping deeply—\ntrue, yet not truly true;\nplaying and shouting—\nfalse, yet not falsely false.\n\nThe twelve auspicious days hold genuine marvels,\nyet the cluster of flowers is but hollow blossoms.\n\nThe *Zhao Yang Palace* performs grotesque music,\nfearing that the true may shatter the false;\nin the *Imperial Flower Garden*, counting on fingers—\nfearing that the false may shatter the true.\n\nTo restrain the heart, to evade the body—\nthe true may become false;\nto depart the *Soul Mountain*, to transform the form—\nthe false may become true.\n\nManifesting the true body, transforming into a bee,\nthe false union, the *Crow and Magpie Palace*—\nfalse within false, true within true—\nindescribable in rigid terms.\n\nYet its origins, though still discernible,\nare such that only the *Buddhist monk of the Golden Pagoda*\ncan clarify the true and false causes and effects—\nnone but Tang Sanzang and his three disciples can do so.\n\nLet one carefully ponder the next chapter,\nwhere *\"Meeting Pairs\"* again reveals the marvel of origins.\n\n---\n**Ninety-fifth Chapter: False Form Captures the Jade Hare, True Yin Returns to Meet the Soul Element**\n\nA disciple awoke and said:\n*\"The Golden Crow and Jade Hare are the essence of sun and moon;\nthe waning, new, full, and crescent phases are the union of yin and yang.\nHeaven and man share no separate principles—\ndivine motion follows its own natural laws.\nThe moon borrows the sun’s light to illuminate,\nyin relies on yang’s function to manifest its use.\nThose who willingly enter the cycle of rebirth\nlet their minds follow *qi* in transformation,\nthus true and false alternately divide and multiply;\nthose who escape death and life\npreserve their nature while reversing *qi*,\nthus true and false ultimately merge as one.\n\nUrgent is the need to clarify and seize with resolve;\ndo not delay, lest they slip away.\nThis chapter precisely clarifies the origins of true and false—\nit is the true exposition of the *Heart Sutra*.\nIt is the monk of the Golden Pagoda’s earnest, sorrowful admonition.\n\nClarity lies within clarity itself,\nyet one cannot distinguish beyond it.\nWhen moonlight is brightest, golden *qi* fills the wheel—\npointing to the moon and verifying its imprint,\nthe marvel of paired union becomes true.\n\nThe essential technique lies in seeing without seeing color,\nremaining entirely free of thought.\nThus, at the chapter’s opening, the traveler sees his master\ncompletely unmoved, and exclaims in awe:\n*\"What a monk!\"*\nThe foundation of not moving the mind\nmust be seen through and the true and false discerned.\n\nThe traveler, seeing through it, cries:\n*\"Master, the princess is false!\"*\nThe elder replies:\n*\"She is false—yet how shall we make her reveal her true form?\"*\nAh! How wondrous!\n\nRecognizing the true within the false—\nthis is the Buddha who came from the West.\n\nFor the false is the false princess;\nyet what is the \"false of the false\"?\nWithin the false there remains the true—\nonly when the true form is revealed\ndoes one attain clear discernment.\n\n*\"How shall we make her reveal her form?\"*\nThen there must be a method indeed.\n\nThe traveler says:\n*\"Summon the *dharma-body*, and seize her here.\"*\nThus it is clear the traveler too is a false form.\n\nIf she does not reveal her true nature,\nthen false is joined with false—\nthe true becomes indistinguishable.\n\nHence, *\"Once the true form is revealed,\nhe steps forward and seizes her,\nshouting: ‘You here fabricate falsehood as truth,\ndeceiving my master’s true *yang*!’*\nThe monk clutches the king, crying:\n*\"Your Majesty, fear not!\nThis is my wayward disciple using *fa-li* to discern true from false.\"*\nHe also consoles the queen:\n*\"Fear not!\nYour princess is but a false form made to seem true.\"*\n\nThroughout, the words *\"true\"* and *\"false\"* are the key.\n\n*\"The false princess shed her garments,\ncast aside her ornaments,\nand in haste discarded her falsehood—\nher true essence now manifest,\nshe fought with the monk.\"*\n\nHere lies the divine subtlety, utterly free of falsehood—\nthis is the true within the union of falseness.\n\nWhen the battle raged long,\nand they neared the Western Paradise,\nit was revealed as a golden being of the West—\nturning back to the gate of the Western Land,\nsuddenly *\"with a wave of his body,\ngolden light radiated in ten thousand rays,\nhurling straight toward the south.\"*\n\nReaching a great mountain,\nhe pressed upon the golden light,\nplunged into the cave—\nand vanished without trace.\n\nThus the West is his native land,\nwhile the South is but his borrowed abode.\n\nAs the *Yijing* says:\n*\"In the southwest, companions appear—\none may walk with them in harmony.\"*\n\nThe traveler gathered his forces and returned.\nAt this point, the immortal master pointed to the profound Dao, saying:\n*\"This is the hour of *shen*.\"*\n\nWhy this sudden mention of *\"shen\"*?\n*\"Shen\"* is metal—\n*ren* water thrives in *shen*.\nIs it time?\nIs it *shen* itself?\nOr *\"shen hour\"*?\nThe hidden meaning leaps forth.\n\nThose with innate immortal essence,\nreading this passage,\nshould reverently set up an incense altar,\nbow a hundred times in devotion, and say:\n*\"Homage to the Great Compassionate, Great Merciful,\nSavior of Suffering, Most Benevolent, Most Holy,\nMost Wondrous Great Bodhisattva.\"*\n\nThe king asks:\n*\"If the false princess is a demon,\nwhere then is my true princess?\"*\n\nThe traveler replies:\n*\"Seize the false princess,\nand the true one will naturally appear.\"*\nThe true lies within the false—\nwhen the false is captured,\nthe true emerges effortlessly.\nThis is the authentic method of saving truth through falsehood.\n\nAt this juncture, vigilance is paramount.\n*\"Dividing inner and outer,\nkeeping the heart ever watchful.\"*\nThis passage speaks to the critical work of guarding against peril—\nmost urgent of all!\n\nOnly thus may one clearly discern true from false,\nlest one waste effort in vain.\n\nThe traveler ascends to the southern peak, where the demon retreats into its lair, feigning cowardice and hiding. The mountain spirit declares:\n*\"This mountain, from ancient times to now, has never harbored a demon—it is a land of fivefold auspicious *yáng* energy. If the Great Sage seeks a demon, he should look toward the Western Heavenly Path.\"*\n\nThis reveals the limited wisdom of one unable to discern true from false. Little do they know that the five radiant *yáng* lands are precisely where the essence of *jīn* (metal) lies concealed. Then:\n\n*\"When the traveler reaches the southern peak’s cavern, two massive stones block the entrance. With an iron rod, he pries them apart—the demon, startled, leaps out with a ‘whoosh!’ Terrifying the mountain spirit and earth god into frantic retreat.\"*\n\nThis is what is meant by *\"speaking the truth sends demons into panic.\"*\n\nA true practitioner recognizes that where five-colored lotuses bloom atop a mountain, the earth’s rivers and mountains are but a single jewel hidden within. True and false intertwine—who can truly distinguish them?\n\nSuddenly, the Star of Lesser Yin reveals how the Jade Rabbit stole the elixir, exposing the case of Chang’e’s descent to the mortal realm. With the truth laid bare, the demon’s original form is exposed—*\"rolling about to reveal its true nature.\"*\n\nThus, the luminosity of Lesser Yin illuminates the true and false of Lesser Yin itself; beyond this illumination, there is no other light.\n\n*\"A radiant patch of clouds appears in the south, bright as day\"*—this marks the moment when the Jade Rabbit returns to its true form. The traveler’s loud cry awakens the deluded. Eight Rules’ lustful impulse is a warning against carnal desire. The king inquires further, realizing the false princess was the true Jade Rabbit, while the true princess was the false one. By removing the false and seeking the true, the old monk’s urgent words at the Golden Temple become clear.\n\nWhen the Jade Rabbit is returned to the Moon Palace, the true *yīn* returns to India. Retracing the illusions of moon-viewing and ball-playing, recounting the tragic separation of mother and child, and reforming the subjugation system of the Precious Flower Monastery—these lingering details all touch upon profound truths. Yet to truly discern true from false, one must awaken the heart.\n\nFurther clarification: The false princess is indeed false—false in her assumed form, yet before assuming it, she was true. Before capture, she was the false princess; once exposed, she became true. False yet truly real—who can distinguish this?\n\nThe true *yīn* is the true princess. Only after returning to purity is she truly true; before that, she cannot be called true. Only when she returns to purity can she reunite with the *língyuán*—can she be said to reunite with it before purity? Even this is false. True yet truly false—who can distinguish this?\n\nDeeper still: The Jade Rabbit is a celestial beast; Chang’e is a celestial maiden. Within the Moon Palace, only the Jade Rabbit’s spirit is vital—all the immortals’ elixirs depend on its mortar and pestle. The Moon Palace can do without Chang’e, but not the Jade Rabbit. The Rabbit is the false consort of the king’s realm yet the true one of the Moon Palace; Chang’e is the true consort of the *Kūn* (receptive) realm yet the false one of the *Qián* (creative) realm. This too must be discerned.\n\nEarlier, the traveler remarked:\n*\"A woman’s husband is her noble one—how could he not be seated?\"*\nThe character *\"seated\"* (坐) combines two *\"people\"* (人) into *\"earth\"* (土). Earth contains *wù-jǐ* (the five earthly branches), and without this earth, a person cannot pair—*\"seated\"* is the subtle essence of *\"deeply in mind.\"*\n\nThe Buddha said:\n*\"Within the *qián-kūn*, between heaven and earth, there is a treasure hidden in the form-mountain, not in the heart or kidneys, but in the *xiānguān* orifice.\"*\nThe term *\"noble\"* (貴) symbolizes *\"a treasure within\"* and is the essence of *\"urgent matters.\"*\n\nAs for *\"India\"* (天竺) and *\"Precious Flower\"* (寶華), *\"heaven\"* (天) is *\"two people\"* (二人), *\"India\"* (竺) is *\"two\"* (二个)—within lies the birth of the Precious Treasure, the essence of *\"encountering a match.\"*\n\nThe final four words—*\"realized nature\"* (了性) and *\"true emptiness\"* (真空)—are not to be confused with the annihilation of nature or empty stillness. These must be clearly distinguished.\n\n---\n**Ninety-sixth Chapter: Leak the Official Welcomes a High Monk, Tang the Elder Rejects Wealth and Nobility**\n\nA disciple asked: In the following two chapters, the calamities of protecting the *dharma* and destroying the *dharma* are shown as one. One uses the slaughter of ten thousand monks as an analogy; the other feigns inviting ten thousand monks. Practitioners must scrutinize their intentions—relying on those with great virtue and strength to protect the *dharma*, not flaunting wealth to invite disaster.\n\nAt the chapter’s start:\n*\"The Pilgrim asks his disciples, ‘What place is this?’ The traveler replies, ‘I do not know, I do not know.’\"*\nThese two *\"I do not know\"* are the key insight.\n\nHuman hearts are unfathomable, and circumstances ever-changing. A tiger may sit guard at the gate, yet the host invites monks to a feast—how can one say one cannot eat at a tiger’s mouth? The surname *Kòu* (寇) suggests banditry, yet the host shows no plundering intent—why suspect the *Kòu* clan and harbor doubts? An old woman fears no ugliness, recognizing the celestial and human realms—why then the shift from respect to rudeness? The heart is unfathomable.\n\nThe son, though seemingly aligned, bows in submission—yet why does a good beginning turn to ruin? Circumstances are ever-changing. At the close of spring and dawn of summer, when the *dào* flows freely, listening to two discuss rise and fall demands vigilant reflection.\n\nThe **Copper Terrace Hall** is a place where one may share in the golden splendor; the **Earthly Spirits County**, a land fortunate to host men of outstanding talent.\n*\"It stirs the townsfolk to such alarm—startled and fearful, speculating and suspicious, crowding around to争看 [peer at the spectacle]!\"*\nThis depicts those who fail to **韬晦 [conceal their brilliance]** and expose their **圭角 [sharp talents]**, inspiring awe and dread among the ignorant and common.\n\nSeeing the phrase *\"万僧不阻 [ten thousand monks unobstructed]\"*, one has already gained the **护法 [dharma-protectors’]** favor, and the **灵山 [Spiritual Vulture Peak]** is not far off.\n\nWhat should be feared are the **妇人小子 [women and children]**, who, when slighted, harbor resentment and stir up strife—like the *\"穿针儿 [Needle Girl]\"* or *\"小秀才 [petty scholar]\"*, truly **绵里裹针 [silk-wrapped needles]** or **根莠败秀 [tares spoiling fine grain]**.\n\nWhat should be guarded against is the **主人 [host]**, who craves fame, proudly displays his **奖善之额 [award for virtue]**, fills his doors with guests, and drowns out the clamor of drums and music.\nWith **结彩 [decorated banners]** and **张筵 [spread feasts]**, flaunting wealth and boasting of victory—he claims to honor teachers and seek friends, yet fails to see it as **开门揖盗 [inviting thieves by bowing at the door]**. Calling him a **寇员外 [bandit host]**, he brings ruin upon himself.\n\nFor indeed, **好客 [hospitality]** may attract unwanted attention, while **觊觎 [covetous schemers]** will seize the opportunity; **不贪 [not being greedy]** yet defying others’ wishes will invite **嫉妒 [envy]**, and the envious will bear grudges.\nAs the saying goes:\n*\"无贪犹取恕 [Refusing greed is akin to granting pardon]，\n剧喜必生优 [Excessive joy breeds sorrow]，\n众女兢闺中 [All women tremble within their chambers]，\n独退反成怒 [Yet the one who withdraws alone provokes wrath].\"*\n\nWhen **Tang Seng [the monk Xuanzang]** arrived at the **华光行院 [Hua Guang Monastery]**, he saw its opulence and brilliance yet found its conduct contrary to the **良贾深藏 [virtuous merchant’s principle of concealing his wares]**.\n\nSuddenly, a dark cloud and heavy rain descended in an instant—just as the saying goes:\n*\"天有不测风云 [Heaven has unpredictable winds and clouds]，\n人有旦夕祸福 [Man has fortunes that shift like morning and evening].\"*\nOne must ever be on guard.\n\nThus concludes:\n*\"泰极还有否 [Prosperity at its peak still harbors decline]，\n乐处又逢悲 [Joy’s abode meets sorrow once more].\"*\nTruly so.\n\n**Chapter Ninety-Seventh: The Golden Reward for External Protection Meets Demon Poison, The Sacred Manifests the Hidden Soul to Save Its Origin**\n\nA disciple of enlightenment remarked: This follows from the preceding passage, illustrating the unfathomable nature of human hearts and the ever-shifting course of events—how prosperity harbors decline, and joy meets sorrow. There is nothing strange in this.\n\nOne must penetrate the subtle principles of yin-yang correspondence and preempt the perils of unpredictable transformations.\n\nBy leveraging mighty strength to subdue the ignorant masses and deploying divine powers to safeguard the original essence, this tale stands in stark contrast to the *Monkey King’s Rebellion*.\n\nThey, through the destruction of the Dharma, slaughtered ten thousand monks—yet never a monk of renown—and required the collusion of the Four Assemblies to complete the deed. Wickedness, yet not yet the height of wickedness!\n\nHere, through the protection of the Dharma, ten thousand monks were fed—yet none were truly virtuous—and the Four Assemblies conspired to fulfill the ritual. Auspicious, yet not yet the full measure of auspiciousness!\n\nSeeing that fortune and misfortune have no ultimate end, yet human desires remain insatiable.\n\nThey avoided execution in the chest only to fall prey to thieves,\nwhile here, avoiding the alms only to be robbed and imprisoned.\n\nThey, as officials, pursued thieves and captured the Four Assemblies,\nwhile here, the Four Assemblies seized thieves only to be apprehended by the officials.\n\nThey stole garments and headgear in secret from the second-storey inn,\nwhile here, they openly presented a *kashaya* before the jailer.\n\nThey killed monks and yet shaved their own heads in repentance,\nwhile here, they fed monks and yet met with sudden, violent retribution.\n\nThey awoke to enlightenment after a night of evil,\nwhile here, they fell into eternal slumber after an instant of virtue.\n\nThey used a thousand hands to shave monks across the land,\nwhile here, a single kick sent them sprawling through the entire county hall.\n\nThey, mother and son, plotted against the guest in secret,\nwhile here, mother and child conspired to ensnare the monk.\n\nThey, the Pilgrim, revealed past lives to a widow in plain speech,\nwhile here, the old man and his mother mimicked idle gossip behind his back.\n\nThey displayed their prowess in the mortal realm,\nwhile here, they secretly wielded divine powers in the underworld.\n\nThey, the shaven monk, was the Pilgrim—yet remained utterly unaware,\nwhile here, the thief was no member of the Four Assemblies—yet insisted on the pretense.\n\nThey, facing the destruction of the Dharma, revered the Law,\nwhile here, encountering its protection, they violated it.\n\nThey, the Pilgrim, disguised as a merchant among the vulgar,\nwhile here, the Pilgrim feigned as a ghost and invoked spirits.\n\nThey saw that evil could not be relied upon,\nwhile here, they saw that virtue could not be boasted of.\n\nAs for this very tale:\nThe household head bore the surname *Kou* and was robbed by *Kou* [bandits],\nwhile Tang Seng sought the Dao and instead encountered thieves.\n\nThe deceased household head spoke though dead,\nwhile the living bandit remained mute.\n\nThe monk acted as the examining magistrate and freed the true thief,\nwhile the prefect, holding false accusations, exonerated the monk.\n\nThe master and disciples returned the stolen goods only to be accused of receiving them,\nwhile the thieves, though robbing and plundering, lost their spoils.\n\nThe false accuser spoke recklessly with fabricated tongues,\nyet the evidence of the stolen goods stood undeniable.\n\nThe innocent, though cleared at the trial’s end,\nonly saw their lifespan extended in vain.\n\nIn life, they refused to harbor the monk,\nyet in death, the monk returned unexpectedly.\n\nFlower-bedecked, they sent the monk out with drums and music resounding,\nwhile bright and clear, they invited thieves in—only to weep in sorrow upon the floor.\n\nEvents twist and turn, reversing and inverting,\ndefying all description, utterly beyond naming.\n\nThe overall description portrays those with wealth as bound to secretly suffer misfortune,\nwhile those of the Dao/Way are prone to trials and tribulations.\nIt is not through possessing the might to trample the entire county with a single kick,\nthat one can subdue the ignorant masses and dispel the venom of demons—\nthus, those who follow the Dao/Way must diligently uphold their foundation,\nsecretly fortify themselves, lest they falter even once.\n\nWhat is this \"great kicking power\"?\nWealth without hoarding is great kicking power;\nFame without clinging is great kicking power;\nPower without misuse is great kicking power;\nLaw without display is great kicking power.\nSoftness and weakness as strength, in harmony with the world without contention—\neven the finest armor of all ages cannot harm them, this is great kicking power;\nDiscerning omens and timing one’s actions, advancing and retreating with rectitude—\nneither water nor fire, nor tigers or rhinoceroses can harm them, this is great kicking power.\nAh! Such virtues can indeed be practiced!\n\nThus, it concludes:\n*\"The earth vast can shelter malevolent deeds,\nthe heavens high never fail those of pure virtue.\nSteady and unhurried along the Path of the Tathāgata,\nOnly reaching the Lotus Sutra’s blissful gate.\"*\n\nThe commentator says this chapter marks the end of the hells,\nand the next begins the heavens—\na view not without insight.\n\nYet heavens and hells, the realms of principle and desire,\nare ever interchanging—\nno true end or beginning exists.\nThe Tang monk’s Dao/Way not yet perfected,\nhis mind not yet pure, cannot escape the hells’ burdens.\n\nAt the **Lingyun Crossing** and the **Bridge of a Single Plank**,\nit still resembles the hells’ grim scenes.\nOnly when he boards the **Bottomless Ship** and reaches the other shore,\ndoes he truly escape the sea of suffering.\n\nThe notion of beginning and end is but a vague perception.\n\n---\n**Chapter Ninety-Eight**\n*\"When the Monkey is Tamed and the Horse Subdued, Only Then Does He Escape the Shell\"*\n*\"When Merit is Fulfilled and the Path Complete, He Sees the True Suchness\"*\n\nThe master said:\n*\"The venerable patriarch, in his compassion for the dull and confused nature of sentient beings,\nfeared they might not grasp the meaning—\nthus, this passage leads them from the very ground of reality,\nso that they may tread firmly and dispel all doubt, fear, and hesitation.\nAh! The **Lingyun Crossing**, the **Bridge of a Single Plank**, and the **Bottomless Ship**—\nthese are truly the most perilous and the most insubstantial.\nHow then does it say 'treading firm ground'?\nIf the intent were not made clear in this division,\nthe patriarch’s original purpose in crafting the **Golden Elixir** would not be passed on,\nand the immortal master’s intention in composing the *Journey to the West* to guide the world\nwould ultimately fail.\nThus, the common folk, lost in the vast sea of suffering,\nwould have no footing to stand;\nthe ordinary and vulgar, swept along in the endless cycle of rebirth,\nwould find no way to rise above.\"*\n\nThose who study Buddhism and sit in meditation are like grinding bricks to make a mirror—\na hundred attempts yield not a single success.\nThose who study Dao and attain the Way are like drawing cakes to stave off hunger—\nutterly without real benefit.\nThose who study the sages and perfect their nature are like threading a needle in lightning—\nthey pass it by in plain sight.\n\nBetter to take the straight path of the **Lingyun Crossing**, the **Bridge of a Single Plank**, and the **Bottomless Ship**—\nfor these are the ways of firm footing.\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"Man’s greatest affliction lies in his having a body.\nIf I had no body, what affliction could there be?\"*\nFor so long as one has a body, there will be affliction.\nTo escape the greatest affliction, one must embody the ultimate Dao.\nTo embody the ultimate Dao, one must clarify the original heart.\n\nThe heart is the substance of the Dao;\nthe Dao is the function of the heart.\nWhen one examines the heart and observes nature,\nthe round and luminous self-illumination arises naturally,\nand the function of non-action is spontaneously fulfilled.\nWithout contrivance, one suddenly transcends the other shore;\nall phenomena are suddenly abandoned, not a speck of dust adheres.\nThe body cannot burden the nature, the world cannot disturb the true self—\nwhat affliction could possibly remain?\n\nThis is the realm of the supreme sage, whose true essence is unblemished.\nThe heart, like a bright mirror, receives without accepting;\nresponding to circumstances, harmonious yet not leading,\nthus able to overcome all things without harm—\nthe wondrous Dao of supreme truth!\n\nAlas, the common folk are dull and deluded, lost in their original nature,\nclinging to their bodies, fearing death and craving life—\nthus they ultimately fail to awaken and verify the truth.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor and Laozi pitied their greed and attachment,\nso they taught methods of nurturing life to guide them according to their desires,\ngradually leading them onward.\nThis is the art of the Golden Elixir—\na method for the average person, a firm-footed practice,\nenabling them to gain purchase and gradually cross to the other shore.\nThe Master of Purple Yang expounded this thoroughly in the *Awakening to Reality* and detailed it extensively in the *Postscript*.\n\nThis *Journey to the West* is the immortal master’s use of Tang Sanzang—\none who awakens gradually as a model of firm footing.\nThrough the intent of seeking scriptures, amid countless trials,\nhe is led to the **Lingyun Crossing**, the **Bridge of a Single Plank**, and the **Bottomless Ship**,\nso that he may transcend the mundane and need not fear or doubt.\nThe summit of the Soul Mountain is none other than the self, naturally attained.\n\nNow let us clarify the true meaning of **\"Lingyun,\" \"Single Plank,\" and \"Bottomless.\"**\nThe Great Dao is broad and straight, like a whetstone or an arrow—\nwhat are these images of \"Lingyun,\" \"Single Plank,\" and \"Bottomless\"?\n\nBecause people’s understanding is shallow and dimmed by desires,\nthe other shore seems distant as the clouds—\nyet if one views all things with detachment, standing beyond the world,\nnurturing the vast and boundless *qi*,\nit will fill the **Lingyun Crossing**.\n\nBecause people act recklessly without restraint, deceiving themselves in secret,\nyet when they reflect, they tremble with dread—\nlike a **Bridge of a Single Plank**—\nif one is diligent and cautious, treading carefully as though on thin ice,\nthen the spirit of solitary vigilance will traverse the **Bridge of a Single Plank**.\n\nIs this not the true realm of genuine practice?\nYet it must be done with sincerity, not achieved through imitation;\nit lies in examining things, not in clinging to one-sidedness.\n\nNow the **\"Bottomless Boat\"** is devised precisely for those who find the **Lingyun Crossing** difficult to traverse and the **Bridge of a Single Plank** difficult to walk. Those who find it difficult to cross and walk are simply those who love their bodies.\n\nThus, if one loves their body while desiring to cross, they must use a boat—and if they use a boat, they must have a bottom. Without a bottom, it is drowning the body; if drowning the body, it is better not to cross or walk at all—then how can it be called love? Not knowing that a boat has a bottom means loving the body while actually drowning it; without a bottom, it is not loving the body yet not drowning it.\n\nWhy? People do not know that a boat *with* a bottom is hollow, while a boat *without* a bottom is solid. A boat with a bottom is the kind people use daily—it saves the body from drowning, yet some fear drowning and refuse to use it; a boat without a bottom is the kind people use once—it saves the body yet *must* drown it, and there will never be those who fear drowning and refuse to use it.\n\nNow, let us test those who have traveled the road for a long time and ask them: *\"If there were a bottomless boat, would you board it?\"* People will surely be angry, calling it either foolishness or madness, unaware that they are already boarding a bottomless boat and drowning themselves.\n\nAgain, let us test those who have traveled the road for a long time and ask them: *\"If there were a bottomless boat that would never drown you, would you board it?\"* People will again be angry, calling it either falsehood or deceit, unaware that there are those who board boats with bottoms and yet still drown.\n\nThus, the bottomless boat is one that all must board yet cannot treat lightly. If one has *vast qi* yet cannot nurture it well, or has a spirit of solitary vigilance yet cannot examine things thoroughly, they have not yet reached the **Lingyun Crossing** or the **Bridge of a Single Plank**—they are like an ape that is strong yet a horse that is unbroken, unable to board the boat and cross.\n\nIf one can nurture their *vast qi* well, maintain solitary vigilance, and reach the **Lingyun Crossing** and the **Bridge of a Single Plank**, yet still wishes to board a boat with a bottom to cross, they are like an ape that is not yet mature and a horse that is not yet trained—unable to board the boat and ask to cross.\n\nAn ape must be fully integrated and unobstructed before it is called mature; a horse must have its strength fully transformed before it is called trained. Confucius said: *\"Hear the Dao in the morning, die in the evening—what more can one ask?\"* Meaning, without hearing the Dao, death is impossible; but if one hears the Dao, even death is acceptable.\n\nThis is called *\"the ape is mature, the horse is trained, only then can one shed the shell.\"* Without the ape being mature and the horse trained, one cannot board the bottomless boat. People all know that a bottomless boat can drown the body, yet they do not know it cannot drown the mature ape and trained horse. People all know that a bottomless boat can drown the body and never rise again, yet they do not know that a bottomless boat cannot drown the trained and mature ape and horse, and they will rise without drowning.\n\nWhen people board a bottomless boat yet still believe it has a bottom, it truly has a bottom, yet they do not know they will drown and never rise. Again, when they see others board a bottomless boat and believe it has no bottom, that they will drown and never rise, it truly is rising without drowning, yet they do not know.\n\nThough it is the same bottomless boat, one assumes it has a bottom and will not drown; though it is the same bottomless boat, there is a vast difference between drowning and not drowning, yet they assume it is the same drowning with no distinction.\n\nThus, what they call a boat *with* a bottom is actually bottomless; what we call a boat *without* a bottom is actually bottomed. Does the boat with a bottom truly float? Is the boat without a bottom truly stable? Is the boat with a bottom truly stable? Is the boat without a bottom truly stable?\n\nTherefore, to board a bottomless boat and truly be stable is something only the mature ape and trained horse can do. To make the ape mature and the horse trained requires the alchemical work of *jin dan*.\n\nThe maturity of the ape is not the maturity of the mind, but the seamless integration of the Dao itself; the training of the horse is not the training of the will, but the complete transformation of one’s cultivation. Mistaking the mind for the ape and the will for the horse is not the grounded practice of reality.\n\nIn the text, those who *\"fake the realm and forcefully bow\"* are not the mature ape and trained horse; those who *\"reach the true realm and dismount\"* are the mature ape and trained horse.\n\n*\"Dao-children guiding\"* is the alchemical essence; *\"being tricked by Guanyin\"* is not trickery, but seeing that Tang Seng can progress gradually yet not suddenly.\n\n*\"Bathing\"* is the verification of the mature ape and trained horse; *\"yesterday in rags, today resplendent\"* is the completion of *jin dan* and shedding the mundane.\n\n*\"Not yet on the Cloud Path, must walk the original path\"*—this clarifies that abandoning the path of cultivating immortality cannot reach the sacred mountain, seeing Tang Seng’s necessity of gradual progress.\n\n*\"Clouds come, clouds go, never truly stepping on this ground\"*—this reveals the traveler’s ability to attain sudden enlightenment without gradual progression.\n\n*\"Just walk out from the Hall of the Celestial Realm, the back door is right there\"*—after action, there is non-action.\n\n*\"Tang Seng sees the living water flowing, startled and mistakenly points; the traveler laughs, saying, ‘No mistake.’ Pointing to the great bridge, one must cross over it to attain the Way\"*—this shows that this body has not yet left the mundane, danger still remains, and one must nurture *qi* until it cannot be nurtured further, maintain solitary vigilance until it cannot be maintained further, and only then can the Way be attained. This is the true time of genuine practice, finding no other path, hence it is said: *\"This is the path, this is the path!\"*\n\n*\"The traveler steps onto the bridge, running back and forth\"*—this is the sudden enlightenment of the superior sage, the ape being naturally mature.\n\nTang Seng says: *\"Difficult! Difficult!\"*\n\nEight Steppings says: *\"Slippery! Slippery! Slippery!\"*—this is the doubt and fear of the mediocre, as if they would ride the clouds and cross swiftly, yet this is the path of delusion taken by those who stray. Hence, the Traveler urgently stops them, forbidding deviation and guiding them back to the true, solid Dao.\n\nAfter shedding the mortal shell, master and disciple owe no thanks to each other—this embodies the principle of *er shi ju de* (both benefactors and beneficiaries), the essence of giving both *fa* (law/teaching) and wealth. Yet in this world, superior sages are few while mediocre minds prevail. None dare avoid death, though they must die; none dare board the bottomless ship, though they must board it. Only the Dao of *jin dan* (Golden Elixir) offers broad observation with true stability and solidity.\n\nBefore attaining *jin dan*, the body is not without peril; after attaining it, the body remains a hindrance to the Dao. Though one may choose not to ascend, it is not as superior as ascending to transcendence. As in the *Chuan Deng Lu* (Record of the Lamp): Lü Zu wandered the Lougu Platform, listening to Huanglong Jian’s Zen teachings. The master, knowing Lü was a transcendent, asked: *\"Who sits below—the river folk?\"* Lü replied: *\"A wandering monk of clouds and water.\"* The master said: *\"What if the clouds disperse and the water dries?\"* Lü had no answer. The master spoke again: *\"Huanglong appears.\"* Lü departed, leaving a poem:\n\n*\"Abandoning the gourd-bag, smashing the lute,\nNow I no longer covet mercury’s gold.\nSince first meeting Huanglong’s truth,\nI regret my past misguided heart.\"*\n\nThis is not regret for the error of mercury and gold, but regret for not realizing their noble transformation. Hence another poem says:\n\n*\"The Bag Monk ascends to Mingzhou,\nStaff in hand, sandals on feet, wandering freely.\nThough you may manifest in myriad forms,\nEach body still bears its own sorrow.\"*\n\nThis speaks further of transcendence within transformation. Thus, great Buddhas and immortals—some depart like cicadas shedding their shells, some perish in flames, some return westward by foot, some climb trees to demonstrate cultivation, some suffer harm to repay debts—though their traces differ, all await the moment when the ape is mature and the horse is tamed.\n\nFor they deeply understand that the physical form cannot endure, while the true spirit eternally persists. This is why the guiding masters emphasize *\"wan dong anran ziran\"* (ten thousand movements in tranquil ease).\n\n*\"Stepping on the ship, unable to stand\"*—this is the mind sinking into fear of death at the moment of ascent.\n*\"One pull and you’re raised\"*—this is the daily practice of *jin dan* pulling you along; not you alone, but all of us.\n*\"Downstream, floating corpses—all say, ‘It’s you, it’s you’\"*—not you alone, but all of you.\n\nAt this stage, how could one not rejoice? This is the boundless wisdom, the birth into the other shore, the supreme truth beyond limits—what need is there for *\"lingyun\"* (soaring clouds), *\"du mu\"* (single plank), or *\"wudi\"* (bottomless ship)?\n\nLiberated from the mortal coil, the work is complete, the path fulfilled.\nAdrift atop the Soul-Mountain’s peak, bowing beneath the Tathagata’s feet,\nOnly then does one recognize Avalokiteshvara’s compassion—\nA single mind entrusted to the *One Hundred Fifty-Four Thousand Fourteen* volumes,\nYet ultimately contained within the *True Scripture of No-Writing*.\n\nThis Scripture is most exalted and precious—guard against transmitting it with empty hands, lest customs grow vulgar and ignorant, leading to disrespect and arrogance. Use the *No-Writing Scripture* for the superior sage, the *Written Scripture* for the masses. The Buddha’s differentiation in transmission mirrors Confucius’ teaching tailored to the student—how different can they be?\n\nAnanda first transmitted the *No-Writing True Scripture*—not out of deceit, but fear of disrespect. Later, he exchanged it for the *Five Thousand Forty-Eight Volume Written Scripture*—transmitting the Golden Elixir with the Golden Bowl. For the *No-Writing* is the sudden method, the *Written* the gradual. Sudden is non-action, gradual is action. From gradual to sudden, from action to non-action—all are True Scriptures. The True Scripture never departs from the *No-Writing River Diagram* and the *Written I Ching*, hence it is said:\n\n*\"The source of the Three Teachings—treasure it! Cherish it!\nWithin lie the secrets of immortality and Dao attainment,\nUnveiling the marvelous prescriptions for ten thousand transformations.\"*\n\nThe text proposes: *\"A total of fourteen years—five thousand forty-eight days, yet eight days short—does not align with the hidden numbers.\"* Ah! Truly a marvelous prescription!\n\nReaders may claim this book shows Daoist and Buddhist origins as one, with Dao as the gateway and Zen as the ultimate attainment—this seems plausible! Yet unknown is that this book solely expounds the Great Dao of the alchemical Golden Elixir. The phrase *\"attaining immortality and completing the Way\"* serves as its entire footnote.\n\nBuddha and Immortal cannot be realized without the Golden Elixir—only through transforming action into non-action. There is no superiority or inferiority. Immortal is Buddha; Buddha is Immortal. The Buddha is called *\"Great Awakened Golden Immortal,\"* while the Immortal is named *\"Great Luo True Immortal.\"* One and two, two and one.\n\nThus it concludes:\n*\"Seeing nature, clarifying mind, and communing with the Buddha-patriarchs—\nWhen virtue is complete and practice fulfilled, one ascends to the skies.\"*\n\n**Ninety-ninth Chapter**\n*\"Ninety-nine times complete, demons eradicated—\nThree threes fulfilled, the Way returns to its root.\"*\n\nThe disciple of enlightenment says: This passage elucidates the meaning of *\"even a hair’s breadth difference prevents elixir completion.\"*\n\nTo let mortals penetrate yin-yang, deeply grasp transformation, measure time like an incense clock, and precisely calculate the fire’s moment—neither excess nor deficiency—only then may one obtain the Golden Elixir, shed the mortal frame, and renew the bones. Should even a hair’s breadth differ, it is like walking ninety paces in a hundred-mile journey.\n\nThe poem concludes with *\"Anciently, its mysteries align with *The Concordance of the Three*\"*—this is the book’s entire essence.\n\nThe *River of Heavenly Passage* marks the halfway point of the ten thousand eight thousand [stages], yet here it proposes returning to origin to complete the nine nines. It reveals that lacking one in nine nines is like abandoning the halfway mark in vain.\n\nThe term *\"Heavenly Passage\"* is chosen because the heavens span fifty-four thousand *li*—the measure of one *藏* (treasure-house). This is when the Great Sage rescues the primordial essence with a fish basket.\n\nThough called half the labor, the latter half achieves only the former half. Laozi said: *\"The Mysterious, yet more mysterious.\"* The first *\"Mysterious\"* refers to the first half; the *\"yet more\"* to the second.\n\nHow could one recognize this without the patriarchs’ direct transmission of the profound intent? Ah! The meaning of *Heavenly Passage* and return to origin is profound. Studying the poem *\"Nine Nines Return to Truth\"* may grant some enlightenment.\n\nThe traveler lifts his head and gazes back: *\"Here! Here!\"*\n\nThe reader may dismiss the traveler’s words as idle chatter, yet they hold profound significance. Though one recognizes the *Heavenly Passage*’s location, why does he repeat it so emphatically? His words imply that even the slightest error in practice occurs here—thus, one must be vigilant and remember it well.\n\n*\"Eight Rules [Precepts] said to Sand Monk: ‘Surely this is your ancestral home!’\nThe traveler replied: ‘No! No! This is the *Heavenly Passage*!’*\nTo call it ancestral home yet insistently correct it—what a warning!\n\nThe traveler declared: *“Cannot depart! Cannot depart!”*\nThis speaks of the *Nine Nines*’ inherent Dao-work, beyond human effort—*\"There is naturally true fire, why need fuel or fanning?\"*\n\nThe old tortoise cried: *“Holy Sage! Here! Here!”*\nMeaning: *From here one goes, and to here one returns.*\n\n*\"The four disciples and five horses, all borne upon his back\"*—this mirrors the *River Diagram*’s symbolism.\nThe Five Phases return to the One *Taiqi*, with no distinction of self or other, as one attains their original form—thus, the Dao returns to its root and fulfills its mandate.\n\nWhen the old tortoise suddenly questions and Master Tang remains silent, then shakes his body, all fall into the water—readers must not misinterpret this. At this juncture, Master Tang’s Dao-fruit is already complete; why would he still lack a trial? It must be supplemented?\n\nIndeed, *refining the elixir* and *returning to origin* occur here—even the slightest misstep cannot yield true attainment. The tortoise’s tale of forgotten trust serves as a critical warning at the *Heavenly Passage*’s most vital moment, emphasizing that true faith must be held here, lest any error arise.\n\nThis is the true *cloak and bowl* of the *Eight Vajra Protectors*, whispering, *“Thus and thus—follow the Bodhisattva’s precepts, not to be violated.”*\nIt cannot be explained through words alone.\n\nIf one interprets the Dao-body as pure *Qian* [Creative], admitting no trace of *yin* [Receptive], or that the *disaster star* remains unfulfilled and still relies on this place to complete it—then one fails to grasp the subtlety of *returning to origin*.\n\n*\"The Three Treasures pressed the sutra, Sand Monk pressed the sutra, the traveler guarded left and right to prevent *yin* demons from wasting [the qi].\"*\nThis reveals that the sutra and this place are prone to error, requiring urgent protection until the *yin* dissipates.\n\nThe traveler said: *“This sutra steals the creative power of Heaven and Earth, enduring as long as the cosmos, as bright as sun and moon, with eternal spring and an unbroken *dharma-body.”*\nThese are the true meanings of *golden elixir*, not mere praise.\n\nAt the brink of completion, one must fear external demons sapping or stealing the work—vigilance must be absolute, never lax.\n\nWhen the sutra’s tail is stained, *“This is the mystery of Heaven and Earth’s incompleteness, beyond human power to remedy.”*\nLaozi said: *“Great completion seems deficient—its use is inexhaustible.”*\n\nReaders claim that Heaven and Earth’s deficiency is, in fact, the grandest truth—mere idle speculation.\n\nSome say the old tortoise’s words exposed it, but I say they ruined it. If *“Heaven and Earth’s incompleteness”* is already a mystery, why must it be explained? Only a true master’s transmission can reveal its *“incompleteness”*—how could one guess its meaning?\n\nAh! Only those who grasp the ebb and flow of the *tidal source* will know the body’s own fullness and emptiness.\n\nThe Chen Family Village’s **Deng** and **Qing** welcomed him with gratitude, repaying the old debt of saving their children—summoning **Chen Guanbao** to present a **yīncín** of gold in thanks, and founding the **Jiùshēng Temple**. All this was the beginning and end of **Huan Yuán’s** [Returning to the Origin] affairs.\n\nFame cannot be dwelled upon for long;\nThe dusty world is no place for a guest to linger.\n*\"A true person does not reveal their form—\nRevealing it, they are no true person.\"*\n*\"Fragrant breezes drift and rise from emptiness\"—\nThe deeds of a true man are complete.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"When the elixir is perfected, one recognizes the original face,\nHealthy as ever, bowing to the master.\"*\n\n**Chapter 100: Directly Returning to the Eastern Land**\n**The Five Saints Achieve Perfection**\n\n**Wu Yīzǐ** said: This entire section concludes the **Jīndān** [Golden Elixir] teachings, encapsulating its essence in the poem’s two lines:\n*\"The five phases’ wondrous hues return to void and stillness,\nA hundred false names are all empty.\"*\n\nFor **Jīndān** arises from the convergence of the five phases, though initially it seems deliberate, in the end it is effortless—hence the saying:\n*\"When the Dao’s fruit is complete, tranquility is natural.\"*\n\nAll its dangers and strangenesses are but emptiness.\n\nThe *Yì* says:\n*\"The interplay of yin and yang is called the Dao.\"*\nYin and yang are originally one **qi**, which encompasses the five phases.\n\nWhen the five phases converge and yin and yang harmonize,\nHeaven and Earth take their places, and all things flourish—\nThis is the ultimate, supreme Dao of beginning and end.\nIf yin is excessive or yang is solitary,\nLacking balance and harmony, how could perfection be achieved?\nThis contradicts the natural order of **tianming** [Heaven’s mandate] and **suìxìng** [following one’s nature],\nAnd fails to grasp their shared origin—\nWhere the divine transformations reside.\n\n**Note:** In Buddhist scriptures, the opening *\"Yēyǒutúo, Móxūluó\"* refers to when the Buddha, before his renunciation, married **Yēyǒutúo** and fathered **Móxūluó**. After twelve years of asceticism, he returned and reunited with them. His words at his parents’ funeral were filled with profound sorrow.\n\nWhen speaking to the archer Shì about the teachings of the celestial deities,\nHe often spoke of filial piety, fraternal duty, loyalty, and sincerity—\nThese were never teachings that strayed from my own **yǐlún** [inherent moral principles].\n\n**Note:** Laozi’s son was named Zōng, who became a general of Wei.\nZōng’s son, Zhù, inscribed the **yǔ** [womb/palace] of his mother;\nThe **xuánsūn** [mysterious grandson], Jiǎ, served under Emperor Wen of Han;\nJiǎ’s son, Xiè, became the tutor of the Prince of Jiaoxi.\nHis descendants flourished in the world, all transmitting the virtues of loyalty and filial piety.\nLater generations, neglecting to cultivate their inner essence and exert their efforts,\nInstead coerced their emotions and attachments,\nClaiming it to be a shortcut to transcendence—\nThus, his disciples all lived as widows and widowers, without wives or children.\nHow could this be the teaching of **Buddha** or **Laozi**?\n\nTo disregard the distinctions between male and female,\nTo abandon the proper order of clothing and ritual,\nAnd merely speak of the study of mind and nature—\nThis may work within the confines of a secluded meditation chamber,\nBut applied to the governance of the world, how few could avoid great chaos!\nNo wonder the Confucian scholars took the opportunity to disparage it!\n\nBetween the Jin, Liang, Tang, and Song dynasties,\nMany rulers, ministers, and great officials studied under them,\nListened to their teachings, and only **Chánglí** [Khan Li, i.e., Han Yu] did not follow.\nLater, he even befriended a leading monk,\nAnd in his old age, he was deceived by alchemy, never reaching its true depths.\n\nFrom *Zhūzǐ’s Collected Sayings*:\n*\"Someone asked, ‘How does Laozi’s ‘wu’ [無, non-being] differ from Buddhism’s ‘wu’?’\nHe replied: ‘Laozi’s non-being is based on the presence of the old [order],\nAs in his saying: *“Wu [無, non-being], to observe its mystery; yǒu [有, being], to observe its limits.”*\nBut Buddhism’s non-being treats Heaven and Earth as illusions,\nAnd the four **dà** [great elements] as false combinations—\nThis is absolute non-being.’\"*\n\nFoolishly, I observe:\nZhūzǐ ultimately conceded to **Huángdān** [Yellow Court, i.e., Daoist alchemy] a single point,\nDeeming it absolute non-being,\nYet failing to recognize its absolute presence.\nIf one knew it as absolute presence,\nThen one would see it aligns with Laozi’s *yǒu* [有, being] and cannot differ;\nIf one knew the unity of **Laozi** and **Buddhism**,\nThen one would see it shares the same origin with **Confucianism** and cannot differ.\n\nReading the line *“The sutra’s origin is paired with the five phases,”*\nDo the teachings of the five phases in all these scriptures truly differ from\nOur Confucian sayings of **rén** [benevolence], **yì** [righteousness], **lǐ** [ritual propriety], **zhì** [wisdom], and **xìn** [trustworthiness]?\nNo!\n\n*\"The branches face east but return to the west\"*—\nThis refers to **Xuánzàng** [Tripitaka Master Xuanzang, i.e., Xuanzang]’s actual journey to fetch the sutras,\nAnd even this single passage reveals his sincerity could move all things,\nWhile Heaven’s will silently responded with its own **líng** [numinous resonance].\n\nThe **bādà jīnjiāng** [Eight Great Vajra Protectors] called from the sky:\n*\"Holy monk, go now and deliver the sutra,\nThen return immediately!\"*\nThe **Sānjiāng** [Three Treasures] recounted the deeds and travels of his three disciples,\nExactly embodying the essence of delivering the sutra.\n*\"Coming and going in eight days’ span—*\nThis means only within the three-five **miàodào** [mysterious transformations] does it unfold.\nThe passage states: *“Five days eastward, three days westward upon return,”*\nComing five, returning three—\nIt clearly indicates the truth,\nYet people fail to awaken to it.\n\nReaders say such passages are beyond thought or imitation,\nYet how can one reconcile *“Three-five as one: three characters—*\nHow few in ancient and modern times truly understand this!”?\n\n**Jīn** [gold], **jǐn** [restraint], **jìn** [prohibition]—\nNo need to stir the mind; naturally, they fall away.\nBefore the Dao is perfected,\nOne must rely on methods and restraints;\nGold is first employed,\nLike the roots generated by thought—\nOnce stirred, they cannot be moved.\nAfter the Dao is perfected,\nOne attains serene stillness, free from thought,\nBreaking beyond all boundaries—\nGold becomes useless;\nOne does not seek to cast it off, yet it casts itself off.\nAs said: *“The ferry-boat left on the river, the ladder discarded in the sky—*\nAll is abandoned upon arrival.”\n\nThe **Zhāngchūn** [Long Spring] Master **Qiū Zhēnrén** [Hill True Person] left this book,\nOriginally intending to reveal the supreme **jīndān** [gold elixir] Dao to future generations,\nYet he borrowed the story of Xuanzang’s quest for the sutras\nTo expound and clarify,\nIllustrating how the **Sānjiāng** [Three Treasures] shed their mortal shells to attain truth—\nBy fulfilling nature to reach **mìng** [fate];\nAnd how the three disciples’ illusory bodies became true—\nBy cultivating **mìng** [fate] to fulfill nature.\nThough their paths differed in gradual and sudden stages,\nTheir ultimate success was one:\nAll became **dàjué** [greatly awakened] golden immortals.\nDivided into five, each became a holy one;\nUnited as one, they all became the **zhēnyǐ** [true unity] of the gold elixir.\nLater people failed to recognize this as the **great Dao of the immortals**,\nInstead calling it **Buddhist fiction**,\nAnd clinging to empty talk of **xīnyuán yǐmǎ** [mind-monkey, heart-horse],\nOr **xīnmiè mómiè** [mind-extinction, demon-extinction],\nTheir understanding as narrow as viewing through a tube or measuring with a ladle—\nHow far they have strayed!\n\nThe **Zǐyáng** [Purple Yang] True Person said:\n*\"Jīn Gōng was originally a son of the eastern household,\nSent westward to a neighboring clan to take a mortal form and be born.\nWhen he recognized the call and returned to his dwelling to nurture [the Dao],\nHe paired with the **xī** [radiant] maiden as a bond of affection.\nAgain, he said: *“To learn the Dao of immortality, one must learn the Dao of celestial immortality,\nAnd only the gold elixir is the most direct path.\nWhen the two essences unite, nature and fate align,\nAnd the five phases gather like the coiled dragons and phoenixes of the **húlóng pán** [Peak of the Tiger and Dragon].\nOriginally paired by the **wùjǐ** [Earthly Branch, i.e., the fifth and sixth phases],\nThus the husband and wife settle in eternal harmony.\nWait only until the work is complete at the northern gate,\nWhere nine clouds’ radiance reveals the soaring cranes.”*\nThis is the mystery of *“directly returning to the eastern lands, the five saints attaining truth.”*\n\nEvery person inherently possesses the **numina** [灵根] of immortality, saints, or Buddhas.\nFrom **post-heaven** [后天] to **pre-heaven** [先天],\nThose who perfect it are not bound to the east or the west—\nThe principle is simple, the attainment effortless.\nWhy should cultivators wait for another life or another world?\nAll teachings ultimately boil down to *“abandoning illusion to attain truth.”*\nThis is why I composed *Zhēn yì* [True Explication].\n\n**My exhortation, your exhortation, the exhortation of all under Heaven and future generations—**\nAll must strive!",

      "translated_text": "**The True Interpretation of the Journey to the West, Chapter One**\n\n**The Spiritual Root Takes Form and Flows Forth; Cultivation of Mind and Nature Gives Birth to the Great Dao**\n\nWu Yizi said: This clarifies that the root-source of the Great Dao is the primordial qi of yin and yang, the precelestial origin of the Hunyuan Taiyi, the True Yi born from nonbeing. By fully realizing the mind and knowing one’s nature through cultivation, one may attain an indestructible golden body and live as long as heaven and earth.\n\nThe two guiding lines of this chapter place greatest emphasis on the first, which encapsulates the author’s overarching principle. Those who interpret it by focusing solely on the word \"mind,\" recklessly imposing misguided annotations, obscure the root-source of the Great Dao and thus fail to comprehend it. Not only do they misunderstand the mind, but they entirely abandon the true essence of the immortal masters’ teachings on liberating the world—how lamentable, how pitiful!\n\nThe \"spiritual root\" spoken of first is the precelestial True Yi qi. As the *Classic* says: *\"Nameless, it is the beginning of heaven and earth; named, it is the mother of the myriad things.\"* It also states: *\"These two emerge together but bear different names.\"* When it is in its qi-state, the True Yi qi is invisible, hence it is the beginning of heaven and earth. When it takes form, the True Yi pearl appears within the void, hence it is the mother of the myriad things. From the One qi arise yin and yang; from yin and yang arise the Four Images; from the Four Images arise the Five Phases; from the Five Phases arise the myriad things—all transformations of the True Yi qi.\n\nAs qi, it stands before heaven and earth and enters within them. It begins as being born from nonbeing, then reverts to being born from being. One who attains this One qi can encompass all phenomena. Thus it is said: *\"Obtain the One, and all matters are complete.\"*\n\n*The Awakening to Reality* states:\n*\"The Dao from emptiness gives birth to the One qi,\nFrom the One qi arise yin and yang,\nYin and yang unite to form the Three Bodies,\nFrom the Three Bodies flourish the myriad things.\"*\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: *\"Heaven and earth intermingle, and the myriad things transform into purity.\"*\n\nFrom the beginning, the Primordial One attained the Dao through a single precious pearl. The sages of the Three Teachings all directly explored this root-source, penetrating the workings of creation.\n\nFor the Dao gives birth to the One qi, the One qi gives birth to form, and within form is contained the original qi. Thus, *\"Heaven One gives birth to water,\"* and water is Ren-water. Ren is the ancestral qi of the True One that generates all things. Ren-water’s phase of long life is in *shen* (the ninth earthly branch), and *shen* is the monkey. *Shen*-metal is born from earth, and stone is the essence and core of earth’s qi—hence the Stone Monkey.\n\nAccording to the celestial cycle of 365 degrees, the twenty-four qi, the Nine Palaces, and the Eight Trigrams, this aligns with what *The Awakening to Reality* states: *\"The Five Phases and Four Images all rely on earth; how could the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams depart from Ren?\"*\n\nYi is the wood of flowers and fruit, born in *zhen* (the east), the place where yang qi first arises. Its natal tone is metal within the sea, hence its location in the Flower-Fruit Mountain of the Eastern Continent of Superior Body. This metal within water is the true gold of the precelestial True Yi before the birth of one’s parents—thus, without father or mother, it is born from a stone egg by Heaven as father and Earth as mother.\n\nIts eyes emitted two beams of golden light, but after consuming postnatal water, the golden light receded and gradually faded, losing its originally endowed nature. Because it is metal within water, it dwells in the Water-Curtain Cave. Within it lies an iron-plank bridge, clearly a celestial and terrestrial creation, not something fashioned by human effort. Such an endowment, once obtained, means *\"my fate is not determined by Heaven\"*—one is no longer subject to the qi of old Heaven.",

      "translated_text": "Indeed, it is the supreme sovereign of joy between Heaven and Earth, hence the title Handsome Monkey King. From what I have heard of the reckoning of Heaven and Earth, this fully clarifies the profound subtleties of the spiritual root’s origin and flow—yet nowhere is the word \"heart\" to be found. The immortal master employs a poetic turn, subtly shifting the focus onto the human body, making it abundantly clear: he borrows the name of the monkey merely to complete the perfection of the Golden Elixir’s great Dao. Were all people through the ages to achieve such perfection, they too would be called outer kings and inner sages, free to act as they please—not because the heart is difficult to master.\n\nThe following passage then explains that one must personally examine its wonders, fully comprehend the heart and know one’s nature, and diligently cultivate and uphold what is most precious. The human body is hard to obtain, a century passes in an instant; one should urgently awaken the heart of the Dao and strive for oneself. Know that the Way of immortals, Buddhas, and sages, the method of longevity and agelessness, is within everyone’s reach—yet how pitiful that all people in the world are mere pursuers of fame and profit, with not a single one attending to their own life and destiny. Thus, the immortal master points out a path: journey westward to inquire, reaching the Western Continent of Cattle-Gift, to seek out the whereabouts of a divine immortal.\n\nAlas! Do immortals choose where they are born? Could it truly be that the Southern Jambu Continent has none, while the Western Continent of Cattle-Gift does? The immortal master’s intent is merely to indicate that the south is a land where fire flourishes, not a place where metal is born—only in the west is true gold produced. This aligns with the overarching theme of the entire book: the scriptures must be sought in the west.\n\nHe speaks of a filial gentleman, for filial piety is the foundation of practicing benevolence and is akin to the Way of immortals. Thus, they are neighbors, and within this lies a profound meaning. The Way of immortals is water giving birth to metal, not metal giving birth to water—an image of the mother nurturing the child in the womb, the child repaying the mother’s kindness, both mirroring the path of filial piety.\n\nThe woodcutter said, “Not far, not far. This mountain is called the Mountain of the Numinous Terrace and Square Inch; upon it lies the Cave of the Slanting Moon and Three Stars. Within the cave dwells a divine immortal, known as the Venerable Patriarch Subhūti.” *Subhūti* in Sanskrit means the true Dao in our tongue. Here, the text explicitly mentions the Numinous Terrace and Square Inch—a hook and three dots—readers will surely say this refers to the character for \"heart,\" and how could I deny it points to the heart?\n\nAlas!

      "translated_text": "If one claims this refers to the heart, then by inquiring into the heart, engaging in meditation, sitting in dhyāna, dispelling desires, and following principle, one could attain longevity—why then seek immortality, quest for the Dao, or rush about east and west? To regard this heart as the heart of Heaven and Earth may be acceptable, but to take it as the heart of the human heart is far from the mark!\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: *\"Not far off is the return; in the return is seen the heart of Heaven and Earth.\"* Yet the heart of Heaven and Earth cannot be seen—only through the hexagram *Fù* (Return), Earth and Thunder, is the heart of Heaven and Earth revealed. For when stillness reaches its extreme, movement arises, and from movement, yang is born. Generation upon generation continues, all rooted in *Kūn* (Earth). Thus, the *Cantong Qi* says: *\"By the mother is the foundation laid\"*—that is, *Kūn* gives birth to *Fù*. It further states: *\"The sixth line of *Kūn* upholds, binding beginning and end. It nurtures all children, ever the mother of kinds.\"* This is the mother of the ten thousand things. Hence the woodcutter says: *\"That patriarch’s disciples are beyond count\"*—meaning all things emerge from this. He adds: *\"Now there are still thirty or forty following him in cultivation.\"* Those who follow are three in the east, four in the west, and ten in the center, while the patriarch himself is one in the north and two in the south—*Kǎn* and *Lí* in harmonious union, the five phases gathered in clarity.\n\nHe further instructs: *\"Follow that small path southward; his home is not far.\"* From the west to the southwest is not far—is this not the position of *Kūn*? The *Book of Changes* says: *\"In the southwest, one gains companions and proceeds with one’s kind.\"* The *Wuzhen Pian* states: *\"Only in the southwest lies one’s native place.\"* The small path is the position of *Duì* in the west, *Duì* being lesser yin, hence called a \"small path.\" \"His home\" is precisely what the *Wuzhen Pian* refers to as *\"recognizing the deathless method of that other household.\"*\n\nFirst, he says, *\"Not far, not far,\"* then simply *\"not far,\"* clearly alluding to the meaning of *\"not far off is the return.\"* Finally, he says, *\"about seven or eight *li* distant\"*—seven and eight make fifteen, the phase of gold meeting the full moon, its meaning subtle indeed.\n\nAt the outset of the immortal master’s chapter, he cites Shao Yaofu’s poem:\n*\"At the winter solstice, half of *zǐ*,\nThe heart of Heaven remains unchanged.\nWhere the first yang stirs,\nBefore the ten thousand things arise.\"*\nThis clarifies the root of Heaven and reveals the locus of the heart of Heaven. *\"Silent and still, with no trace of man\"*—this is the extreme of yin stillness. Yet before stillness reaches its extreme, the heart of Heaven and Earth is not seen; only when stillness first stirs is the heart of Heaven and Earth revealed. Thus, the image of the Handsome Monkey King leaping onto a pine branch to pluck fruit elucidates the meaning of *Zhèn* (Thunder) wood’s initial stirring at the *zǐ* hour.\n\nSuch are the profound principles expounded. The boy says: *\"My master was lecturing on the Dao but did not explain the reason. He sent me to fetch you—I suppose it must be you.\"* The Monkey King replies: *\"It is I, it is I!\"*—here lies another subtle meaning. For the essence of true yi resides in the east but dwells in the west—this is the principle of yin and yang inverted. Since birth, it has wandered in that other household; now, recognizing it and stating the cause, it is clearly one’s own original possession. Hence he says, *\"It is I, it is I!\"*—echoing the earlier phrase *\"that other household.\"*\n\nSeeing the Venerable Patriarch Subhūti seated upon the dais, with thirty young immortals standing to either side, this embodies the meaning of the *Cantong Qi*: *\"The sixth line of *Kūn* upholds, binding beginning and end\"*—five times six is thirty. Later immortals also take the *Kūn* direction as the place of the moon’s birth, symbolized by the crescent moon. The hook is the crescent, the three dots the three stars. The moon receives the true yang qi and generates brightness, within which lies the image of the three stars—essence, qi, and spirit. *Fù* is the first of yang, the new moon the first of the month. Thus, the *Cantong Qi* says: *\"Five times six, thirty days, the cycle completes and begins anew.\"* Master Wei equates the thirty days of the moon with the *Kūn* hexagram—both express the same idea.\n\nThe poem of the Greatly Awakened Golden Immortal, in its emptiness and true suchness, reveals in every line that only by recognizing the heart of Heaven can one be a great master of the Dharma. Yet to fully realize this heart, one must know one’s nature. Knowing one’s nature, one knows the subtlety of the heart of Heaven and completes the great Dao.\n\nThe Monkey King, with sincere heart and clear ritual, journeys from east to west—all to seek knowledge of his nature. He says: *\"I have no nature,\"* *\"I have no parents,\"* *\"I suppose I was born from a tree,\"* *\"No, I grew from stone.\"* For after birth, he was stained by worldly desires and gradually lost his primordial nature, no longer knowing himself as a thing of *Zhèn* wood from the east, nor as the body of *Duì* metal from the west. How could he not abandon the endowment bestowed by Heaven and Earth?\n\nThus, the greatly compassionate Subhūti says: *\"I shall take a surname for you from your own body. Ancient moon, old yin, cannot transform to bear male offspring—yet ‘infant’ fits perfectly with this discourse.\"* The immortal master has already revealed the wondrousness within nature; no further words are needed. The Monkey King exclaims: *\"Good!\"*",

      "translated_text": "\"Excellent! Excellent! Only today do I know my surname.\" He then exclaimed, \"Wonderful! Wonderful! Wonderful! From this day forth, I shall be called Sun Wukong!\" Should one grasp the meaning of the characters *hao* (excellent), *xing* (surname), and *kong* (emptiness), one would be a being of vast wisdom, a true suchness of the ocean of original nature, awakened and perfectly enlightened. Thus it is said: *\"When chaos first parted, no surnames existed—shatter the stubborn void, and you must awaken to emptiness.\"* Yet to perceive the true nature of the primordial, one must delve deeply into the acquired.\n\n**Chapter Two: Penetrating the Wondrous Truth of the Dao—Severing Demons to Return and Merge with the Original Spirit**\n\nWu Yizi states: This reveals the true and wondrous transmission of the great alchemical Dao, subtly illustrating the method of *\"taking from Kan to fill Li,\"* thereby returning to the root and merging with the original spirit. The key lies in the two characters *\"penetrating awakening\"*—one must focus the mind here. The principles of the true and wondrous Dao require profound awakening and thorough penetration, and only with the transmission of a true master can one properly begin. It is not that this mind is the Dao, nor that awakening alone suffices. If self-cultivation through the mind alone could attain the Dao, then what is awakened? What is attained? This is but the practice of silent sitting in the gate of stillness—ultimately grasping at the moon’s reflection in water, all in vain. Thus, the chapter subtly hints at the meaning of *\"severing demons\"* to return and merge with the original spirit. When he retrieves the golden cudgel from his own cave, it fully embodies the principle of returning to the root and merging with the original spirit.\n\nThe immortal master’s poem reads:\n*\"The three families unite as they naturally are,\nPointing to the unborn, revealing the mystery of nature.\"*\n\nPeople know the *\"three families\"* as three surnames, yet they do not know the three families are one surname. Knowing the wonder of the earlier poem—*\"originally no surname\"*—one then understands the wonder of this poem: *\"the three families unite as they naturally are.\"* Though called three surnames, they are ultimately one surname; though called one surname, they are ultimately no surname.\n\nWhen Wukong hears the master expound the Dao and recognizes its wondrous resonance, it is the moment when he can be spoken to of the Dao. On Rotten Peach Mountain, he ate his fill of peaches seven times. Rotten peaches symbolize the stripping away of the outer husk, revealing the kernel within. The *Cantong Qi* says: *\"Stripping away the limbs, dissolving the form—when the Dao is exhausted, it returns, reverting to the primal Kun.\"* This is the time of *\"stripping down to rise again.\"* The seven times signify the principle of *\"the seventh day’s return.\"* At the moment when the Dao-heart manifests, the ancestral master declares that all four methods—movement, stillness, flow, and quietude—are side doors. Through question and answer, distinctions are made with clarity.\n\nWhat is particularly startling is that within the *\"flow\"* category, the Confucian, Buddhist, and Daoist traditions are deemed side doors, and within the *\"stillness\"* category, practices like *\"pure quietude and non-action\"* and *\"guarding the spirit to enter samadhi\"* are likewise labeled as such. This is bound to arouse astonishment. Why? The Confucian seeks to rectify the heart, the Buddhist to illuminate the mind, and the Daoist to contemplate the mind. *\"Pure quietude and non-action\"* is the heart-method of Laozi; *\"meditating and entering samadhi\"* is the mind-seal of the Buddha. All cultivate the mind, perfectly aligning with the interpretation of *\"monkey-mind and horse-intent\"* in *Journey to the West*, the understanding of *\"gathering the scattered mind.\"* Yet now, it is said to be like *\"setting a pillar in a wall\"* or *\"a brick in a kiln\"*—abandoning this to seek the true mind elsewhere leaves one bewildered: where is it to be found?\n\nAlas! This reveals the long-standing error in reading and interpreting *Journey to the West* as *\"monkey-mind and horse-intent,\"* the superficiality of *\"gathering the scattered mind.\"* The immortal master has already made this plainly evident, and it is not my private opinion. The great sages of the three teachings devoted themselves to cultivating the Dao, not to equating the cultivation of the mind with the Dao. It is acceptable to say the Dao harmonizes with the monkey-mind; it is unacceptable to say the monkey-mind is the Dao. The common interpretations of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism as *\"monkey-mind and horse-intent,\"* as *\"gathering the scattered mind,\"* are why the master explicitly calls them side doors, not the supreme and true great Dao of the golden elixir.\n\nThis Dao, even the naturally most intelligent Wukong could not comprehend—thus he had to seek the transmission from Subhuti. As the Perfected One of Purple Yang said: *\"Even if one’s wisdom surpasses Yan and Min, without a true teacher, do not force guesses.\"* Had Wukong not been of the most naturally intelligent and wished to force guesses from within himself, could he have heard of it? There are also those vulgar and foolish men who, with their *\"yin-cultivation and yang-supplementation\"* heresies, deceive and distort the sacred scriptures. Thus, the master first refutes their delusions in the *\"movement\"* category, urging those with aspirations to learn the Dao to pay close attention.\n\nThis Dao is transmitted but once in ten thousand kalpas—it is not imparted to those unworthy. The Patriarch Subhuti set it as a riddle within a tray, transmitting it in secret. Wukong was able to shatter the tray, kneel in faith, and receive it—truly a seed of Buddhahood. The Patriarch then chanted from his mouth: *\"Difficult! Difficult! Difficult!\"*",
      "overlap_context": "ing of *Zhèn* wood from the east, nor as the body of *Duì* metal from the west. How could he not abandon the endowment bestowed by Heaven and Earth?\n\nThus, the greatly compassionate Subhūti says: *\"I shall take a surname for you from your own body. Ancient moon, old yin, cannot transform to bear male offspring—yet ‘infant’ fits perfectly with this discourse.\"* The immortal master has already revealed the wondrousness within nature; no further words are needed. The Monkey King exclaims: *\"Good!\"*",

      "translated_text": "The Dao is most profound.\nDo not treat the Golden Elixir as commonplace.\nWithout meeting a perfected master to transmit the wondrous formula,\nOne’s words will but parley the tongue dry!\n\nKnow then that the Way of the Golden Elixir must be received through a master’s transmission—it cannot be sought among men. Yet though Wukong shattered the tray’s riddle, discerning that three taps meant the third watch, that the closed gate was the back door for entry, and that the Dao was transmitted in secret, he still regulated his breath, gathered his spirit, and waited until the hour before or after midnight to stealthily open the back door, approach the sleeping couch, and kneel to beseech the Way of long life. The Patriarch intoned:\n\n*\"The wondrous formula of perfect esoteric and exoteric teachings—\nNothing else avails in cultivating nature and destiny.\nAll comes down to essence, qi, and spirit:\nGuard them firmly, seal them well, let no leakage occur.\nLet no leakage occur—conceal them within the body,\nAnd the Dao you receive shall flourish of itself.\nRemember this oral formula, for it brings great benefit:\nBanish perverse desires to attain cool clarity.\nAttain cool clarity, and radiance will shine pure.\nThen ascend the cinnabar terrace to admire the bright moon.\nThe moon conceals the Jade Hare, the sun conceals the Golden Crow,\nWhile the Tortoise and Serpent coil in mutual embrace.\nCoiled in embrace, nature and destiny grow firm,\nEnabling one to plant golden lotuses in fire.\nGathering and reversing the Five Agents,\nWhen the work is complete, one becomes Buddha or immortal.\"*\n\nThis is the beginning and end of the Golden Elixir’s workings, every word encompassing all. If one receives the oral formula’s guidance, one may then hear the Dao. Within it, the three crucial words—essence, qi, and spirit—lest they be misconstrued, I shall explicitly point out: this essence is not the essence of intercourse, this qi is not the qi of breathing, and this spirit is not the spirit of thought. Take care not to grope within your own mind and fall into the delusion of the \"monkey-mind and horse-intent,\" mistaking the \"scattered mind\" for the true.\n\nThe Patriarch revealed the root source, and Wukong memorized the oral formula, secretly upholding it. The workings of the Golden Elixir—warming and nurturing before midnight and after noon—after three years, his dharma-nature became quite penetrating. Yet after five hundred years, Heaven would send a thunder calamity, requiring him to see his nature and clarify his mind. Know that seeing one’s nature and clarifying the mind are matters *after* the Elixir’s completion. Without seeing nature and clarifying the mind, principle and desire remain mixed, unable to achieve purity, and one falls into heterodoxy. Thus, the heavenly spirits cannot tolerate it, and the thunder calamity is unavoidable. Such external disasters are still relatively easy to evade. But if one cannot see nature and clarify the mind, the body’s yin fire remains unremoved, and over time, it accumulates into harm, spontaneously generating fire calamities. If one cannot see nature and clarify the mind, the body’s yin qi remains uncleansed, and over time, it accumulates into misfortune, spontaneously generating wind calamities. These three calamities arise after the Dao’s completion, necessitating a return to the ultimate state of non-action and original truth.\n\nAfter transmitting the oral formula, the Patriarch saw the practitioner master transformations: first climbing clouds, then the somersault cloud, all demonstrating that by seeing nature and clarifying the mind, one can transcend the mundane and share in Heaven and Earth’s transformations, progressing from strenuous effort to spiritual transformation. Readers of *Journey to the West* see the seventy-two transformations and the thirty-six-thousand-mile somersault and interpret them as the mind. But if it were merely the mind, it would be empty delusion—precisely the \"scattered mind\"—what true reality or solid foundation would there be? They do not know that this is the wondrous efficacy of the Golden Elixir, a true and practical skill. Transformations are not limited to ten thousand times ten thousand, but are summarized by the seventy-two seasonal qi movements; somersaults are not limited to ten thousand times ten thousand, but are summarized by the number of the two *zang* organs. This Dao is only for self-knowledge and should not be flaunted before crowds. Thus, since ancient times, Buddhas and immortals who attained the Dao would transcend and depart, concealing their brilliance, for they had truly seen their nature and clarified their minds.\n\nWhen the practitioner transformed into a tree to play tricks, he inevitably startled the crowd—what kind of world would that be? Thus, the Patriarch said: *\"Dare you flaunt this skill before others? If someone seeks it from you, should you fear misfortune, you may only transmit it to them; if you do not, they will surely harm you.\"* From this, know that as long as one has not left the mortal world, one must never flaunt one’s skills before others. Therefore, the Patriarch transmitted another method to him, saying: *\"Go now. Return whence you came.\"* This was to teach him to return to his origin to avoid calamity.\n\nNevertheless, the seventy-two transformations correspond to the year’s seasonal nodes; climbing clouds represents the arrival of dharma-essence; \"beware the intentional man\" means to guard one’s mind closely; the thirty-six thousand miles correspond to the number of the two *zang* organs; transforming into a pine tree signifies the union of metal and wood, lead and mercury; the moving tongue that stirs up right and wrong signifies the need for discreet refinement; not flaunting before others is to guard against unforeseen calamities; \"whence you came, thither return\" means coming from the East and returning to the East—this is how one preserves life and nature. Only those who have received a master’s transmission may claim to have mastered it. In less than an hour, he saw Flower-Fruit Mountain and the Water-Curtain Cave, and the Handsome Monkey King knew bliss—for the Golden Elixir had succeeded. Here again is a riddle within a riddle, a mystery within a mystery, which no ordinary person could shatter. All are whispered secrets, wondrous methods within the oral formula.\n\nThe oral formula of the Golden Elixir could not be written down by the Patriarch, and fearing that worldly people would forever struggle to comprehend it, he subtly revealed its meaning to Wukong after his return to the cave, enacting a tale of demon-quelling. It was made clear that upon returning to the cave, one must first sever this demon. The Monkey King was metal within water, departing the East for the West. From the day of his departure, the water of due North mingled with the Water-Curtain Cave, and the monkeys of the cave mingled with the water *zang* of due North—hence, the \"Demon King of the Turbid World.\"",

      "translated_text": "Seeking the iron plate beneath the Iron-Plate Bridge is a principle of certainty. One who styles himself a Heaven-Born Sage, beyond birth and extinction, and claims extraordinary destiny must obtain the Ultimate Oneness to wield it.\n\nThe Dragon King produced a great halberd—this was Qian’s first yang, yet it was not to be used. He then brought forth a nine-pronged fork—this was Qian’s fourth yang, but it did not suit his intent. The weight of three thousand six hundred catties corresponded to four nines, thirty-six, encompassing the first, second, and third yang lines. Next appeared a painted-shaft square halberd—this was Qian’s third, fourth, and top yang lines, uniting three lines into eight nines, seven thousand two hundred catties—still not to his liking.\n\nOnly when the Heaven-River Bottom-Stabilizing Divine Iron was mentioned—Yu the Great’s gauge for measuring the depths of rivers and seas—did enlightenment dawn. This treasure had been passed from Yao to Shun, and Shun to Yu, transmitted through the sages as the essence of centrality, the very core of Qian’s fifth yang, the true mean of the Dragon’s virtue. None but a Heaven-Born Sage, possessed of effortless great courage, could bear such a burden! The Dragon King declared, \"It cannot be lifted, nor carried!\"\n\nThe iron radiated ten thousand beams of golden light—for from it arise all principles and all things. Its length of two *zhang* signified two fives making ten; the directions—east three, south two, north one, west four, center ten—were all embodied. The two golden bands at either end and the black iron in the center represented the principle of \"grasping the two extremes and employing the mean.\" Named the Compliant Golden-Hooped Rod, it weighed thirteen thousand five hundred catties—for compliance meant adapting perfectly to the mind’s every movement. Thirteen thousand five hundred catties corresponded to nine and five nines, forty-five—this was the nine-five. It also concealed the numbers three and four, twelve, symbolizing the directions of east, west, south, north, and center. Twelve thousand, plus fifteen, embodied the meaning of three and five. This instrument thus encompassed the entire hexagram of Qian.\n\nAs the Monkey King pondered and murmured, the rod shrank to a length of one *zhang* and two *chi*, as thick as a rice bowl—revealing its ability to transform at will, possessing constancy within inconstancy. The length of one *zhang* and two *chi* also signified three and four, twelve; the bowl’s mouth represented perfect roundness, showing inconstancy within constancy. For it was firm, strong, central, and pure—utterly refined. Such was the marvel of this enlightened instrument when grasped.\n\nFor centuries, readers and commentators of *Journey to the West* have all claimed this rod symbolizes the mind, fixating on the word \"compliant.\" Yet do they not know the *Doctrine of the Mean*’s preface speaks of \"the treasure of the sage, the correct Dao\"? Is this truly the mind, or not? Why not ponder deeply the passage: \"It begins with one principle, unfolds into ten thousand affairs, and in the end returns to one principle—when extended, it fills the six directions; when retracted, it withdraws into secrecy\"?\n\nThe Golden-Hooped Rod, passed down through the sages, clearly embodies the essential principle of centrality. Daoist adepts call it \"the metal within water\"—the utmost truth and wonder within the great Dao, beyond words. When Wukong held it in his hand, he grasped the mean. \"One guest does not offend two hosts,\" and \"without a fixed destination, he does not leave\"—this is the non-dual Dharma gate. \"Walking three houses is not as good as sitting in one,\" and \"seeking ten thousand things is still seeking one thing\"—for three houses are ultimately one house, ten thousand things ultimately one thing, as the saying goes: \"Obtain the One, and all affairs are complete.\" \"Not going, not going, adapting to high and low\"—this is not clinging to principle to chase after things, but awaiting their arrival to respond. \"Beating the drum and striking the bell, all assemble in an instant\"—its influence is vast, its spiritual resonance swift.\n\nEast is the Wood of the Azure Dragon, and only with the tribute of three beings was the rod made complete. Herein lies the meaning of consulting the Four Peaks and harmonizing the Four Symbols. Such was the subtlety of the immortal master’s naming.\n\nThe silk slippers emerged from water—this was the Dark Warrior, the north. The chainmail armor was forged from metal—this was the White Tiger, the west. The phoenix-winged crown blazed with fire—this was the Vermilion Bird, the south. Thus, from east, west, south, and north, all submitted without resistance. This was the guiding principle: \"The thousand mountains and four seas all bow in submission.\"\n\nWukong leapt from the waves, his body not a drop wet. Golden light gleamed as he walked onto the bridge—for he now embodied the pure Qian hexagram, and the Dao’s essence was complete. Holding the treasure in his hand, he could make it large or small at will, displaying a divine power that modeled heaven and earth. The rod reached up to the thirty-third heaven and down to the eighteenth layer of hell. When he withdrew the cosmic form, it shrank back into an embroidery needle, which he tucked into his ear. Readers of *Journey to the West* marvel at such wondrous transformations, dismissing them as impossible—mere metaphors for the mind’s subtlety. Yet this is the most ordinary of principles: \"When extended, it fills the six directions; when retracted, it withdraws into secrecy.\" How can this be called the \"monkey mind\" or \"horse intent\"?\n\nThis Dao commands not only the submission of demons, humans, and spirits but also the reverence of the hidden and the strange. The four monkeys and six kings make ten kinds. From the great—dragons, roc, lions, and macaques—to all creatures that fly, walk, or crawl, and all beings with consciousness, none are not encompassed by it.\n\nLord Laozi said: \"The Gate of the Mysterious Female is called the Root of Creation. All men tread upon it to emerge, and all creeping things without exception proceed from it.\" For one who fully realizes their nature can fully realize the nature of all things. When one is fully realized, all are fully realized—and one can then \"lay down the heart.\" Not \"lay down the heart\" but \"lay the heart down,\" not \"the heart laid down\" but \"lay down the heart\"—the profound meaning therein is beyond the understanding of ordinary people.",

Flower Fruit Mountain became an ironclad golden fortress, its foundation unshakable, its reach boundless—yet it had not yet attained spiritual communion.\nThus, the Monkey King said, 'This blade of mine is truly fierce, but it does not fulfill my intent.'\nFor this Dao prizes centrality and purity, only then can it advance unimpeded.\nThus, the quest to seek broadly from the sea cannot cease.\"",

      "translated_text": "Here yet arises a tangle of private interpretations and stolen insights. Critics who fix their gaze upon this point declare that the very harm of \"laying down the heart\" lies in its truth—at the threshold of life and death, to \"lay down the heart\" is to invite demonic delusions and drowsy torpor, plunging one into the netherworld. They regard Sun Wukong as never having attained the Dao, relying solely on forced preservation, missing the mark by a vast margin. The guiding principle states, *\"The Nine Netherworlds and Ten Kinds are all erased from the register,\"* for it is made clear that he has already attained the Dao, and thus nothing can bind him. The path of learning, indeed, seeks only to \"lay down the heart.\" Yet if the Dao is truly perfected, one may follow the heart’s desires without restraint. Wukong has already obtained the Golden Cudgel, donned his full armor, and wields the mean with divine transformation—his powers unfathomable. Thus, the phrase *\"lay down the heart\"* is employed to reveal his unobstructed ascent to heaven and descent into earth. How could the mere word \"death\" stir his heart? Hence, the following passage first demonstrates his prowess by entering the netherworld and displaying his artifice.\n\nThose who critique *Journey to the West* consistently mistake the heart for the Dao and \"laying down the heart\" for the heart’s harm, leading to myriad misinterpretations and a loss of truth. They fail to recognize that the heart is precisely the cause of life and death, the root of samsara. The sages speak of preserving the heart as the method for governing the world through moral teachings; the Buddhas and immortals speak of the heart’s absence as the way to transcend the world through non-action. Without penetrating the root, merely clinging to superficial theories of the heart, how can one escape the endless cycle of rebirth? For those who have not attained the Dao, death is death, and life is also death; for those who have attained it, life is life, and death is also life. Unifying life and death as one, one achieves longevity. Fear of death gives rise to the heart of death and thus fails to attain life; fearlessness of death dissolves the heart of life and thus fails to attain death. If one preserves the heart out of fear of death, death arrives swiftly; if one does not know where the heart is stored, it must reside where life arises—within death lies life, and within life lies death. Death after death, life after life—when will it end? Unaware of whether one is human or thing, enduring countless trials without liberation, this is the suffering of eternal death, not the joy of eternal life.\n\nWukong, asleep, saw two figures holding a writ bearing the name \"Sun Wukong.\" The names they bore were inevitably one \"Living Uncertain\" and the other \"Death’s Allotment\"—inescapable, beyond human control. Wukong alone awoke in sudden realization, drew his treasure, and pounded the two death-summoners into mincemeat. He untied his bonds, stormed back into the city, turning the dead to life and the death-summoners to death. The Ten Yama Kings, thrown into chaos, could not command him and ordered him to inspect the Register of Life and Death himself. Upon reaching the *hun* section, entry 1,350, it matched the number of his treasure—also a combination of three and five. At 342 years, the \"hundred\" signified one hundred, also corresponding to the numbers of the five directions: east three, south two, west four, north one, and center ten. He took up the brush and struck through them all. The meaning of this single stroke is profound! The heart is the root of death. Its subtleties shall be expounded in another passage; for now, let us clarify the meaning of the character for \"heart.\"\n\nWhen the hook of the character *xin* (心, \"heart\") points upward, it signifies \"not laying down the heart,\" and thus the ledger of death is recorded; when the hook points downward, it signifies \"laying down the heart,\" and thus the ledger of death is erased. Striking through them all, he declared, *\"Settled! Settled! From now on, you have no authority over me!\"* Such actions shook heaven and earth. Yet for Wukong, it was as effortless as tripping over a blade of grass. A single stumble awakened him—this was the key. Ordinary people take their lives to be a dream; Wukong took death to be a dream. Ordinary people act as if dead while alive; Wukong erased his living name from within death. Venturing into the sea posed no obstacle to his body; entering the netherworld posed no obstacle to his spirit. His divine transformations in exiting and entering the netherworld reached their utmost subtlety. Why, then, did he trip over a blade of grass? The \"blade of grass\" (*caoda*) signifies the dawn of primordial chaos, like the initial hexagram *Zhun*, where chaos first parts, as if awakening from a dream. Yet without ascending to heaven, one cannot witness the power of its unfolding.\n\nObserve how the two memorials reached directly to the heavens, as if serving as his passport. A celestial envoy arrived to welcome him, precisely as he was contemplating the heavens. How vast is the function of the Golden Elixir! Thus, the Perfected Lord of Purple Yang said: *\"Swallow a grain of the Golden Elixir, and you will know your fate is not ruled by heaven.\"*\n\n**Chapter Four: Appointed as Protector of the Horses—Heart Still Unsatisfied; Named Equal of Heaven—Intent Yet Unsettled**\n\nMaster Wu Yi Zi said: This reveals the great Dao of the Golden Fluid and Returning Elixir, where one’s lifespan equals that of heaven, soaring above the Nine Heavens, transcending all bounds—even the Heavenly Emperor cannot restrain him. The Heavenly Emperor, sovereign of heaven and earth, governs the netherworld, encompasses past and present, and has no equal. Only the sage can observe the Dao of heaven and grasp its workings, harmonizing yin and yang, uniting with the divine in virtue, and transforming all things to stand alongside heaven. Why is this so?",

      "translated_text": "Gold is indestructible through kalpas; the Elixir is the essence of sun and moon, a mass of pure Yang qi. What heaven and earth circulate is qi; what the Golden Elixir transforms is also qi. The qi of heaven and earth encompasses all; the qi of the Golden Elixir contains all. Thus the *Cantong Qi* states: *\"Nurture essence and cultivate spirit, commune with the virtue of the Three Lights. All evil disperses, and the true qi abides.\"* It also says: *\"Hidden and submerged, it transforms within, enfolding the myriad things as the warp and woof of the Dao.\"* Both speak of the sage’s body and measure equaling that of heaven. What the *Book of Changes* calls *\"harmonizing virtue with heaven and earth, brightness with sun and moon, fortune and misfortune with ghosts and spirits\"*—how does this differ from the *Doctrine of the Mean*’s *\"Heaven and earth take their places, the myriad things are nurtured, all learned and practiced from childhood\"*? That the great sage equals heaven in name—what doubt can there be?\n\nThose who read *Journey to the West* misread its key themes, taking *\"heart still unsatisfied\"* and *\"intent yet unsettled\"* as mere \"monkey-mind and horse-will,\" seizing half a phrase or a single word to force their interpretations. All because they fail to grasp the vastness of the Golden Elixir’s Dao. The Dao of the Golden Elixir unites the Five Emperors and returns to the Supreme Ultimate, steers kalpas through the boundless, and transcends the constraints of heaven and earth—how could the post of Heavenly Stablemaster suffice to match its office? Even the empty title of \"Equal of Heaven\" cannot exhaust its measure.\n\nWhen the Star of Metal and the Monkey King ascend together on clouds, why is the Star of Metal left behind? The Star of Metal is but one of the Five Phases; Sun Wukong embodies all Five Phases. Yet why does he block the gates of heaven, refusing entry? Even the heavenly deities cannot recognize him. The Star of Metal says they have never met, and that upon seeing the Heavenly Honored One, he may come and go as he pleases. Why then does Wukong say, *\"Very well, I shall not enter\"*? It is simply that he refuses to be bound by heaven.\n\nThe Star of Metal reports: *\"The demonic immortal has arrived.\"* The Jade Emperor asks: *\"Which one is the demonic immortal?\"* To call Wukong a demon is a misnomer. Wukong responds at once: *\"This old monkey is.\"* Accepting the title without refusal reveals his capacity for inclusion. All the immortal ministers recoil in shock—his stature is clearly beyond theirs. The Emperor then says: *\"This demonic immortal from the lower realm, newly attained human form, does not understand court etiquette.\"* Though the Heavenly Emperor displays magnanimity, he has not yet discerned Wukong’s wondrous nature as the primordial True One. This is the root of his later inability to subdue him.\n\nWukong bows deeply toward the throne, accepting without refusal. Is this not Wukong encompassing the Heavenly Emperor? The Heavenly Stables lack a director, and the Jade Emperor issues a decree appointing him *Bima Wen*. Upon taking office, *Bima* works day and night without rest, embodying the meaning of *\"Heaven’s movement is ceaseless; the noble person exerts unrelenting effort, vigilant even at dusk, ever striving.\"* Those who annotate *Journey to the West* misinterpret this as the fire-timing of midnight and noon—truly a heretical and absurd reading.\n\nYet what is called a \"horse\" in heaven would surely be called a \"dragon\" on earth. What is named the \"Heavenly Stables\" in heaven would surely be named the \"Dragon Taming Bureau\" on earth. Wukong asks: *\"No rank—does that mean it’s extremely high?\"* The crowd replies: *\"It’s called ‘Unranked.’\"* What is \"unranked\" in heaven becomes the highest rank when viewed from the earthly realm. Why then does Wukong say: *\"I won’t do it, I won’t do it\"*? In ancient times, Emperor Yao sought to yield the world to Xu You and Chao Fu, who washed their ears to cleanse the taint of such an offer. How could one as great as Wukong willingly remain in the post of Heavenly Stablemaster?\n\nWith a sudden crash, he overturns his seat, draws out his treasure, and smashes his way out of the stables, heading straight for the Southern Gate of Heaven. What resolute transcendence! Unaware, his heart ignites with fury, his mind seething with indignation—this reveals that to assign the office of stablemaster to one who steers kalpas is a fundamental contradiction, utterly impossible. The fire in his heart, the rage in his mind, arise from the natural effulgence of his golden light. Annotators again mistake this for \"scattered thoughts and wild intentions.\" But in the radiant presence of the Heavenly Emperor, could one with scattered thoughts and wild intentions roam freely, unchecked and unchallenged?\n\nPurple Yang the Perfected says: *\"Swallow a grain of the Golden Elixir, and you will know your fate is not ruled by heaven.\"* The ancestral master Wei Boyang says: *\"Heaven and earth, gods and spirits, cannot be fathomed. Use them to secure your body, conceal your form, and hide.\"* The forms, images, and numbers of heaven and earth are known to all. But the mechanisms of divine concealment and ghostly stealth remain beyond human comprehension. Only the sage knows that essence becomes things and wandering souls transform. Thus, understanding the conditions of ghosts and spirits, he masters their utility and secures his body. The cosmos rests in his hand; creation arises from his heart. He emerges from being and enters non-being, his presence and absence unfathomable. Knowing this, one understands that the great sage’s descent to earth and ascent to heaven are matters of true intent and real application, not subject to heaven’s constraints.\n\nThus, the Single-Horned Demon King pledges allegiance to him. A king with a single horn is a sovereign. The offering of the cinnabar-yellow robe symbolizes the principle of *\"yellow at the center, penetrating all patterns.\"* Urging him to proclaim himself the Great Sage Equal of Heaven and raise his banner is to declare that authority rests with him, not heaven. The robe is yellow with a cinnabar hue—surpassing red, it embodies the meaning of *\"Yang at its apex.\"* A king who rules himself is lofty indeed.",

      "translated_text": "Herein lies the image of the Ascendant Dragon. Though it has subdued the root of future chaos and rebellion, when the Jade Emperor appointed Li Tianwang as the Great Marshal to Subdue Demons, seeking to capture and tame the Great Sage, he failed to examine the origins of his nurturance or the subtleties of his cultivation. Instead, he mistook the Great Sage for a demon—no wonder he could not subdue him.\n\nThus, when the Giant Spirit Deity struck once and fled, and Nezha struck once and fled, how could it be strange that one whose sageliness was whole triumphed over the lesser denizens of heaven? That the Giant Spirit fled without a fight was only fitting. Yet when Nezha transformed—sprouting three heads, six arms, and ten thousand thousand forms—this was the three horizontal lines of *Qian*, the image of myriad transformations following nature. The Great Sage likewise transformed—three heads, six arms, ten thousand thousand forms—also the three horizontal lines of *Qian*, the image of myriad transformations following nature. Their forms were equal, their strength matched.\n\nWhy, then, did the Great Sage pluck a single hair, reveal his original form, and strike Nezha’s left shoulder from behind, sending him fleeing? For Nezha stood first, as the lower three lines of *Qian*, while the Great Sage stood after, as the upper three lines of *Qian*. At the apex of pure Yang, it must transform and return to the first line, breaking its rigidity—was this not the plucking of a single hair to reveal his original form, striking from behind to wound the left shoulder?\n\nHeaven mistook the Great Sage for a demon, taking truth for falsehood, and thus the Six Demons proclaimed themselves sages, inverting falsehood as truth. Not only could it not subdue the sage, but it could not even subdue demons. Heaven, seeing the sage as a demon, could not subdue a single demon; the sage, seeing demons as sages, could subdue a host of sages. All later subduals of a thousand demons and ten thousand monsters stemmed from this. His capacity had long since encompassed what lay beyond heaven—how could the empty title of \"Equal of Heaven\" bind him?\n\nWhen the Heavenly King’s son returned to report and request troops, the Jade Emperor, astonished by his words, still deemed them mad and sought to execute him. This was precisely what the Buddha had foretold: *\"All the hosts of heaven shall be struck with doubt.\"* The Star of Venus then memorialized, \"Fearing we cannot subdue him at once, I beg to appoint him as the Great Sage Equal of Heaven, to curb his wayward heart.\" The Jade Emperor assented and issued the decree, as if heaven could thus indulge the sage.\n\nYet indulging the sage while failing to subdue him arose from the misguided attempt to \"curb his wayward heart.\" For if Wukong were not a sage, he could not be indulged; once indulged as a sage, how could his \"waywardness\" be removed? To call it waywardness while indulging it was to indulge the waywardness itself—how could this lead to subjugation? The later chaos in the Peach Orchard was not Wukong’s doing, but the result of the Jade Emperor and the Golden Star indulging him to create disorder. What intent did Wukong have? When he saw the peaches, he ate them—what else could he do but follow the sage’s or the demon’s nature as it arose?\n\nThe Jade Emperor said, \"Wukong, come forth. I now proclaim you the Great Sage Equal of Heaven.\" The rank was supreme. Yet what the Jade Emperor deemed the highest office, Wukong merely acknowledged with a bow, no different from his time as Keeper of the Heavenly Stables. He did not regard the title of Great Sage Equal of Heaven as the ultimate rank, for his greatness was self-proclaimed, his equality with heaven self-declared—it was not the emperor who made him great or equal. Since he had already made himself great and equal, how could one prevent him from being so? And how could one make him content or at peace?\n\nThe establishment of two empty offices was of no benefit—it only served to oversee his discontent and his incompleteness.",

      "translated_text": "Wukuyi said: This reveals the Dao of heaven where things reach their extreme and must reverse—a mechanism beyond the ken of ghosts and spirits, the natural operation of the primordial True Unity’s qi, not something the Great Sage could claim as his own design. The immortal master merely borrows names and images to depict its wonder. Those who mistake this for a mere \"monkey of the mind\" take it as a display of literary skill, while those who fail to grasp the principle see it as mere stylistic variation—how far they stray from the truth by a hair’s breadth!\n\nThe Great Sage established himself in rectitude, matching heaven in name—this is the ninth line of Qian, the image of the ascendant dragon. When yang reaches its extreme, it must reverse: such is the natural principle. How could the Great Sage truly reverse it? How could the Heavenly Palace truly be overturned? The Heavenly Palace is Qian as heaven, the palace of the ninth line—could the Great Sage truly reverse it? Yet reversal must begin with disorder, and disorder must have its cause and occasion.\n\nWhy does the text speak of the \"monkey of the mind\" running wild, conjuring these illusions, weaving clusters of literary flowers merely to dazzle the eyes and mind? The Palace of Equality with Heaven stands to the right of the Peach Orchard, so the orchard must lie to the left. The Dao of heaven turns leftward. The Great Sage dwells at the pinnacle of pure yang, yang within yang—his qi shifts from warmth to heat, the time when the myriad things flourish, when yang reaches its extreme and becomes ascendant.\n\nAt the summer solstice, a single yin is born, yet its force cannot reverse into yin; instead, it turns leftward toward the Peach Orchard. The left side is the Green Dragon, belonging to wood, hence the peach—this is the idle provocation of a true person. The Jade Emperor’s authority over the peaches is the inevitable course of qi’s movement, not something the Great Sage could control.\n\nThose who doubt may ask: If the Great Sage has attained the primordial Dao, mastering yin and yang without being manipulated by them, why can he not control himself from reversing? They do not understand that the primordial Dao moves both in accord and in opposition. The primordial Dao is opposed in its embodiment, reversing yin into yang, becoming sage, immortal, or buddha. Yet humans, creatures, demons, and ghosts follow its accord, as do the earth, the netherworld, and even the heavenly gods. To embody opposition while employing accord—this is how opposition gives rise to accord. This is what is meant by \"the primordial Dao, which heaven does not defy,\" and \"using the nine without being used by it.\"\n\nWhen the primordial Dao is employed in accord, it reverses yang into yin, becoming human, creature, ghost, or demon. Then the gods oppose it, the heavens oppose it, and even the buddhas and immortals oppose it. To embody accord while employing opposition—this is how accord gives rise to opposition. This is what is meant by \"the later heaven following heaven’s timing,\" and \"using the six without being used by it.\" Master Cheng said: \"The mind connects with what precedes heaven, yet its application must follow the later heaven; affairs align with what follows heaven, yet their understanding must precede heaven.\"\n\nThe *Wenyan* states: \"Who but the sage knows advance and retreat, life and death, without losing correctness?\" This rebellion in the Heavenly Palace precisely illustrates the Great Sage’s masterful employment of the primordial Dao in accord. The Peach Orchard is the emergence of the emperor from Zhen within the Kun palace. The three thousand six hundred trees correspond to the six sixes of thirty-six in the Kun palace. The first twelve hundred trees are the two sixes of twelve in Kun’s initial two lines—this is the lower vehicle. The three thousand years for their ripening signify the lesser attainment.\n\nThe middle twelve hundred trees are the two sixes of twelve in Kun’s middle two lines—this is the middle vehicle. The last twelve hundred trees are the two sixes of twelve in Kun’s fifth and sixth lines—this is the higher vehicle. The ripened peaches are yang within yin. After this, visiting every three to five days: five days make a *hou*, fifteen days make a *qi*, and three times five is fifteen—this marks the descent of yin qi. Thus, the ripening of the peaches follows heaven’s movement.\n\nThe sudden scheme arises at the time when the yang body is about to transform. Removing his cap and robes is the image of *Bo* (Splitting) reaching its extreme. Eating his fill of ripe peaches: yang receives Kun’s yin qi, and yang gradually turns to yin. Returning to steal peaches after two or three days: two and three make five, another *hou*. The Queen Mother sends seven immortal maidens to pick peaches: the later hexagram *Gu* (Meeting) is when six yang lines encounter seven, bringing *Gu*—seven days complete *Gu*, hence the seven maidens.\n\nThe Great Sage transforms into a two-inch man, sleeping in the dense leaves atop a great tree—how wondrous! Green leaves form shade; two is a yin line, small is a yin image. Thus, the great becomes small, the odd becomes even, yang transforms into yin. Qian’s first line gains yin and becomes Xun. Sleeping marks the time when yang wanes and yin waxes. Following heaven in concealment is \"using the nine\" to \"see a flock of dragons without a head\"—employing hardness with softness, dwelling in ascendance yet concealing it in the beginning.\n\nThe lines \"Only the clothes and hat were missing, nowhere to be found\" and the like all carry profound meaning. The immortal maidens enter beneath the trees to pick peaches: yin gradually advances to strip yang. The first three baskets and the last three baskets—are these not \"three days before *jia* and three days after *jia*,\" simply the first three and the last three? From first to middle, from middle to last, only sparse flowers and fruit are seen, subtly alluding to the time of decline on Flower-Fruit Mountain.\n\nThe immortal maidens look east and west, seeing only on the southern branch a peach half-red, half-white. The green-clad maiden pulls down the branch, the red-clad maiden plucks it—such wondrous meanings cannot be fully expressed. The southern direction refers to the peach borne on the northern branch; half-red, half-white marks the moment of near-ripening.",

      "translated_text": "Only this—what meets the eye alone. The green-clad maiden pulls down the branch: green, the true color of yin, inwardly yin yet outwardly yang. The red-clad maiden plucks it: red, the true color of yang, outwardly yin yet inwardly yang. As the branch is lifted upward, the Great Sage awakens abruptly, revealing his true form—this is an unlooked-for encounter, called *Gou*. Pure yang suddenly meets a single yin, the first advance of the feminine. *Gou* arises when heaven’s heart, through *Xun*, receives the first of *Kun* as earth.\n\nWang Yuanmei said: “When *Bo* descends into chaos, *Gou* arises; when *Gou* descends into chaos, there is no sorrow—only in *Bo* does one fear *Gou*.” For one yin harbors the ambition to contend with five yangs, its vigor truly formidable. Here lies the very origin of the calamity that would disrupt the Peach Banquet. The Great Sage, recognizing the onset of disaster, flies into a rage, exclaiming, “You’ve stolen my peaches!” To steal peaches is to pilfer the profound mechanism of heaven and earth, to rob the creative workings of yin and yang.\n\nYet when the immortal maidens speak of the Peach Banquet and the Queen Mother’s august decree, of the sages of east, west, south, north, and center—this is clearly the convergence of the Five Phases. And the Great Sage’s primordial qi is its sovereign lord. Perceiving the portent of *Gou*’s beginning, he turns wrath to joy, employing the art of immobilization: “Stay, stay, stay!”—this is *Gou*’s first six, “bound to the metal *ni*.” Like the *ni* that halts a chariot, fastened with metal’s unyielding strength, it arrests firmly to prevent further advance, lest the yielding way entangle him. Here the immortal master, in utmost compassion, has already revealed the wondrous subtlety of commencing the Golden Elixir.\n\nFrom this, the Great Sage leaps out of the peach garden and directly encounters the Barefoot Great Immortal—this is *Gou*’s first six, “the emaciated pig hesitates.” The pig delights in wood and hesitates, and though emaciated, it must leap and bound; one must prepare deeply, for its force cannot be easily stopped. Thus he devises a plan and transforms at once, assuming the guise of the Barefoot Great Immortal—this is *Bo*’s first six, “stripping the bed at the feet.” Bare feet signify *Bo*: yin is about to encroach upon the yang path, ascending from below.\n\nRushing toward Jasper Pool to return, no immortals appear, when suddenly a waft of wine fragrance reaches him. Exerting his divine power, he presses against the vats and jars, drinking to his heart’s content—this is *Gou*’s nine-two, “wrapping the fish, not reaching the guests.” Like a fisherman who arrives first, casting a net to catch all; those who come later, though skilled in fishing, cannot match him. Here *Xun* is the white cogon grass, the wrapped fish the beauty of yin things. Yet it is controlled early, lest it reach the assembled guests.

The first is resented by the second; three, isolated and without support, seeks an encounter in its ambition, thus finding no peace in its place and faltering in its steps. This is the image of being trapped between advance and retreat.\n\nProceeding to the Tushita Palace, he suddenly awakens to realization: all this time, he had come to seek this elder, yet upon entering, not a soul is to be seen—this is *Gou*’s nine-four, “the wrapped sack holds no fish; misfortune arises.” Four and the first should correspond and meet, but the first has already encountered the second, leaving four unfulfilled. Having lost its destined meeting, it is like a sack without fish—popular favor has departed. The separation is about to begin.\n\nEntering the Elixir Chamber, he sees five gourds, which contain refined golden elixir. Pouring it out, he drinks—this is *Gou*’s nine-five, “wrapping the melon with willow, containing inner radiance; there is a fall from heaven.” Willow grows in fertile soil, yet the wrapped melon remains uneaten.

      "translated_text": "\"Flee! Better to descend to the mortal realm and be a king!\" Without retracing his steps, he took the Western Gate of Heaven, using the art of invisibility to escape, returning to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. Ah! How wondrous! The world does not recognize the subtlety within these writings, mistaking Wukong’s violation of Heaven’s decrees as mere worldly flight—unaware that this is the Great Sage’s compliance with Heaven’s will in retreat. Ascending to Heaven and descending to the mountain is called the \"Heaven-Mountain Retreat.\" The Great Sage, knowing the excess of yang and turning toward *xun*, five yang suddenly encountering one yin becomes *gou*—*gou*’s perilous momentum cannot be curbed. It is the root of *xun*; the mechanism of retreat; the gradual onset of *pi*; the foundation of *bo*; the inception of *kun*. To fail to retreat at this juncture is to lack awareness of the moment. This retreat is to depart from excess and conceal oneself in the beginning. Thus, the Great Sage’s disruption of the Peach Banquet was not his doing—it was the work of the qi’s course; the immortal maidens’ plucking of the peaches was not the Queen Mother’s dispatch—it was the qi’s course that sent them. All is the doing of *gou*. Thus, the chapter most thoroughly embeds the meaning of *gou*. Knowing the fierce calamity of feminine yin, only by the Great Sage’s compliance in discerning it and opposition in restraining it can the great Dao of primordial Heaven be made clear. Those who critique *Journey to the West*, reducing the Great Sage’s disruption of the Peach Banquet and rebellion in Heaven’s Palace to mere depictions of deluded desires, do grievous wrong! How lamentable! The Great Sage, returning to the mountain to feast, somersaulted back in an instant using the art of invisibility, arriving at the Jasper Pool—where the guests remained unaware—seizing the four great jars and returning to his cave to hold a drinking assembly. Such is the way of stealth and vigilance, soaring in excess yet following the heart’s desire: meeting it, one sees not its head; following it, one sees not its tail. Left or right, all is fitting.",

      "translated_text": "Though the fermented brew had sown the seeds of chaos far and wide, it could still be silently shifted and subtly redirected. The two instances of \"art of invisibility\" in this passage precisely capture the unfathomable marvel of vanishing without a trace. When the Jade Emperor was informed and dispatched the Four Heavenly Kings with a hundred thousand celestial troops and eighteen layers of heavenly nets and earthly snares, the Great Sage paid them no heed—this is what is meant by \"cares and woes cannot burden him, arrows and snares cannot reach him.\" He flees in name yet does not flee in truth. Who but the Great Sage could abide in such ease and self-possession?\n\nThe Great Sage repelled the Nine Luminaries and laughed, saying, \"These deeds are indeed real—what do you intend to do now?\" For the Four Heavenly Kings and the Nine Luminaries are none other than the *nine in the fourth place* of the hexagram, all yang and unyielding. The Great Sage, embodying *\"fellowship with hidden weapons in the wilds,\"* dared not rise openly to advance, and thus could oppose the five yang lines without fear—this is the *nine in the third place* of *Fellowship*. When the *nine in the fourth place* clashed with the Great Sage, they fought from dawn till dusk; all the horned demons were captured, save for the Four Vigorous Ones who escaped. The horned demon corresponds to the *top yang of Coupling*—unyielding in the highest position. At that moment, its rigidity had no place to manifest, no position to encounter, and unlike the *nine in the fifth place* of *Fellowship*, which *\"contains brilliance and guards it,\"* it was seized. Yet the *nine in the fourth place* could not claim full victory, for it bore the image of *\"mounting the wall but failing to attack\"* in *Fellowship*. The Four Vigorous Ones and the Great Sage correspond to the *nine in the fifth place* of *Fellowship*. Amidst the five yang lines, the central and correct position finds resonance with the *two in the second place*, and thus they could cover the retreat. *\"First wailing, then laughing\"*—why first wail? The *two in the second place*, separated by the *three* and *four*, could not aid the *five*, hence the wailing, born of private attachment. Later, meeting the *five* unharmed, they laughed—this too was private sentiment.\n\nThe Great Sage said, \"Why fret? Just guard tightly, eat your fill, sleep soundly, and nurture your spirit.\" This is the *top yang of Fellowship*, *\"fellowship in the wilds,\"* where one’s aspirations remain unfulfilled. For the Great Sage harbored a will that spanned Heaven and Earth, yet the times were adverse, cutting him off from humanity and forcing him into reclusion—how pitiable! Reading the words *\"nurture your spirit,\"* my tears flow like rivers.\n\n**Chapter Six: Guanyin Attends the Banquet to Inquire of the Cause; The Little Sage Displays Might to Subdue the Great Sage**\n\nWu Yizi says: This elucidates the principle of the waxing and waning of yin and yang, the alternation of prosperity and decline, the great going and the small coming, shifting with the times. It reveals how the Great Sage’s unfathomable transformations, though compliant in their application, never stray from the primordial Dao of Heaven. The passage brims with boundless meaning, encompassing all without a single superfluous word. I know not how the immortal master, when setting brush to paper, could so effortlessly weave such a tapestry, every thread a truth. It is because his Dao had reached its apex, his mind like the vast emptiness, where the transformations of Heaven and humanity are mirrored in his writing. The shallow grasp its shallows, the profound its depths—all depends on the learner’s own attainment. Yet how lamentable that the world has never truly understood!\n\nGuanyin Bodhisattva appears throughout the text, and this passage serves as its guiding thread, revealing the marvel of divine insight. To *observe*—how profound its meaning! To observe is to manifest correctness to others, guiding them toward purity without self-assertion. As the *Book of Changes* says: *\"Great observation is above; compliant and yielding, it is central. Correctness is observed throughout the world.\"* And again: *\"Observe the Dao of Heaven, and the four seasons do not err. The sage establishes teaching through the divine Dao, and the world submits.\"* Below, there is the wish to observe oneself and the people; above, there is no ruler who establishes teaching through the divine Dao. Above, there is the virtue of observing oneself and the people; below, there is the crudeness of childish observation and admonition—this is not divine observation. Divine observation employs yin without revealing it to others, and thus it stands above compliance, worthy of the name *Great Observation*. Why? The Dao of observation is the Dao of Heaven. To observe Heaven’s divine Dao is to silently and subtly operate, teaching through the manifest to reveal the divine—not revealing the divine through teaching. This is the unmanifest power of the divine.\n\nThus, Guanyin Bodhisattva arrives at the moment when yang wanes and yin waxes, establishing teaching through the divine Dao so that the world submits. Guanyin Bodhisattva is *Great Observation*; attending the banquet is *temporal observation*; inquiring of the cause is *divine observation*. Seeing the banquet in disarray, though celestial immortals were present, none took their seats—this was the gathering of yang’s waning and yin’s waxing. Commanding Hui’an to scout the military situation was the pivotal moment of divine observation. Here, the immortal master first sets forth the image of the *Ding* hexagram, laying the groundwork for the Great Sage’s eventual submission.\n\nThe *Ding* cauldron has fire above and wood below, used for cooking and offering to the Supreme Emperor and the sages. The Peach Banquet was such an offering. Yet the Great Sage, though a sage, was not present—this was a failure to partake in the offering, leading to chaos. Was this not a loss of the proper balance and transformation in cooking? This Peach Banquet was a gathering of yin’s ascendancy and yang’s decline. Who but the divine observer, Guanyin Bodhisattva, could discern the cause of this ebb and flow? The trend was inevitable: yin would advance further, and yang would wane further. It was a gathering of *Adversity*, where yang would soon be stripped away. The times compelled it, yet not entirely—ah! The immortal master’s subtle admonition to the world is profound indeed!",

      "translated_text": "For the *Ding* cauldron embodies the secret essence of the Golden Elixir, and thus the immortal master dared not speak of it plainly, instead setting forth this symbol to await the discernment of later generations. He specifically invoked Guanyin’s joined palms in a single offering to reveal the marvelous function of divine observation—knowing that yin was growing while yang was waning, just as petty men advance while noble men retreat, as at the mouth of the Guan River in Guanzhou.\n\nThe *Book of Songs* says: *“The old man pours and pours,”* and the following line reads: *“The young lad prances and prances.”* The “young lad” is yin, and he dwells at the mouth of the Guan River. The Manifestly Sage Erlang, True Lord, is the second line of *Kun*’s hexagram. *Kun*’s yin, moving in accord with Heaven, follows a path of radiant display, its power compliant and unfailingly advantageous. At this moment, for the Great Sage, what came before was *Gou* and *Dun*; what followed would be *Pi* and *Bo*.\n\nThe six brothers are the six yin lines; the twelve hundred grass-headed spirits are the two sixes that make twelve. The first and second lines show petty men joining ranks to advance, like *“pulling the creeping grass, each after its kind.”* The grass-soldiers form a *Cui* hexagram, an image of thronging and surging abundance. That they *“heed commands but not proclamations”* reveals their insubordinate nature. The divine troops, leading hawks and hounds, appear as nothing but hawks and hounds. The True Lord laughed and said, *“This little sage has come,”* clearly declaring his smallness.\n\nYet one must contend with him in transformations—how subtle is the meaning of *transformation*! The *Book of Changes* says: *“In *Bo*, the yielding transforms into the firm.”* If yin strips away yang, why speak of *transformation*? Generally, when noble men expel petty men, they denounce their crimes before the royal court and cast them out without hesitation. Thus in the *Guai* hexagram, five yang lines expel one yin, and it is called *Guai*. When petty men expel noble men, their reasoning is unjust and their words unrighteous. They cause yang to dwindle day by day without realizing it is changing, revealing the cunning of their schemes. The subsequent *“one transformation, two transformations, three transformations, four transformations”* are all part of their art.\n\nThe Little Sage then said: *“Gentlemen, with your heavenly nets and earthly snares, do not cover the space above.”* Generally, when petty men harm noble men, they first allow them freedom to roam, then secretly exploit their vulnerabilities, leaving no trace. Such is the venom of their plots. The passage where the six brothers are ordered to restrain the hawks and hounds, with their laughter and gestures, vividly portrays the demeanor of petty men. The Great Sage, seeing this, asked with a grin about their origins. Once their roots were revealed, he knew their yin-like adaptability and mutability.\n\nErlang shook himself and transformed, towering ten thousand *zhang* tall, brandishing the Three-Pointed, Two-Edged Divine Blade in both hands. The second transformation completes the *Kun* hexagram. *Kun*’s yin moves in accord with Heaven, its power and flame filling the sky—this is the natural course of events. Why raise the Three-Pointed, Two-Edged Divine Blade? The word *“point”* clearly signifies a petty man, while the *“two edges”* resemble two lips. It shows a heart without mercy but wielding a weapon of slaughter. With green face and fanged teeth, crimson hair—is this not a ravenous demon? Though the Great Sage’s upright *qi* fills Heaven and Earth, capable of resistance, how could he contend with the grass-headed hawks and hounds rising in pursuit, startling his wings into retreat!\n\nThe Great Sage, sensing the great calamity had begun, concealed his golden-hooped staff in his ear and transformed into a sparrow, alighting and perching on a treetop. This mirrors the first line of *Ming Yi*: *“In *Ming Yi*, it flies, its wings drooping.”*",

For in ordinary times, he feigned restraint, but in haste, his ferocity was fully exposed. Transforming into a starving hawk, he spread his wings to strike—was this not reliance on the sharpness of talons and beak? The Great Sage became a great *ci* vulture, soaring into the sky, which is the line of *Ming Yi*’s six in the fourth place: *“Entering the left belly, one obtains the heart of *Ming Yi* upon exiting the gate.”* For when concealment among the near is no longer possible, one may yet enter the hidden recesses of the left belly.

      "translated_text": "Erlang ever wielded his beak—yet it was in the end most fearsome. The Immortal Master’s brush, arriving here, unwittingly sets one’s whole body dripping with sweat.\n\nThe Great Sage next transformed into a bustard, a creature that thrives in flocks, keeps its ranks, and lives in company without cliques. Erlang, companion to hawks and crows, ought to have welcomed the flock and averted danger—yet he loathed the bustard’s association with phoenixes as a disgrace, and at once nocked his pellet-bow to strike, revealing how the upright and the crooked cannot coexist. But why did he not transform, instead resorting to the bow? In general, when petty men despise gentlemen, they seldom provoke trouble themselves but incite others to strike with pellets and bring harm. In seeming non-transformation lies the most extreme transformation.\n\nThe Great Sage seized the moment, rolled down the cliff, and transformed into a village shrine. This transformation’s subtlety, its hidden meaning, eludes the world’s understanding. Some critics praise it as the alchemy of prose; others mock it as a “monkey-headed shrine,” and for centuries none have glimpsed its depths. Truly, the Great Sage’s shrine-transformation is such that few can fathom its rarity.\n\nWhy did the Great Sage not transform into something else but chose instead a shrine so manifestly impossible to conceal? And why, of all places to flee, did he transform into Erlang and enter the very shrine he could not enter? The meaning is already plain and evident. To grasp it, one must read the *Hexagram Bo*’s top line: *“The great fruit is not eaten; the gentleman carries it away, while the petty man strips the hut.”*\n\nAt that moment, the Great Sage had no path to heaven, no gate to earth; steadfast in tribulation, all yang had dissolved, only the topmost line remained. The gentleman above shelters the host of yin, like a hut. Should the stripping reach its limit and consume the fruit, he would lose his own shelter. In the end, stripping yang is self-stripping. Thus the Great Sage transformed into a hut-like shrine to halt the stripping, then transformed into Erlang to merge with him, then entered Erlang’s shrine to show that the Great Sage’s shrine was Erlang’s shrine, and Erlang’s shrine was the Great Sage’s shrine—thereby making it clear. Hence the words: *“Sir, do not clamor—the shrine now bears the surname Sun.”* To strip Sun’s hut is to strip Yang’s hut; Yang’s hut is Sun’s hut. Thus the great fruit warns petty men not to consume it, and one should follow the times and halt.\n\nYet the tail was difficult to conceal, standing erect behind as a flagpole—another layer of subtlety. When gentlemen evade peril and withdraw from the world, it is better to act first than last. If all others go first and I alone lag behind, I miss the moment and court disaster. Thus to vanish without a trace is the ultimate withdrawal. To withdraw with the tail exposed leaves traces for prying eyes. Hence the *Hexagram Dun*’s first line: *“Withdrawal with the tail—danger.”* The Great Sage, at the *Hexagram Gou*, withdrew in accordance with heaven’s Dao of concealment, yet even so could not escape the peril of tail-withdrawal. Who recognizes the danger of tail-withdrawal?\n\nThe Immortal Master specifically uses the tail to illustrate the peril of tail-withdrawal. Yet withdrawal must not expose the tail, and stripping must not reach the tail. Now Erlang’s stripping has reached its peak above, even touching the tail—he should be warned to halt swiftly and turn back.\n\nThe Great Sage’s mouth became the shrine’s gate, fit for offerings but not for pursuit; his teeth became the door leaves, venerable and indestructible; his tongue became the bodhisattva, manifesting from compassion; his eyes became the window lattice, veiling brilliance with obscurity. Erlang sought first to smash the lattice, then to kick in the door leaves—envying its clarity and clamping its mouth shut.\n\nThe Great Sage was then in his tiger-transformation, yet the crowd instead raised the demon-revealing mirror, bowing humbly and spitting out slanderous words—an age-old pattern, nothing strange. The episode where he summons Li Hu and Zhang Long vividly portrays the postures of bribery and gluttony; such is the Immortal Master’s artistry in exposition.\n\nYet the crux lies solely in the Great Sage’s *observing and advancing*, and the Little Sage’s *stripping and coming*. What comes constitutes what goes; what is small constitutes what is great; observation is what constitutes stripping. Thus the sage looks up to observe the patterns of heaven, looks down to examine the principles of earth. Tracing origins and returning to endings, he knows the discourse of life and death. With spirit he knows the future; with knowledge he stores the past—thus he illuminates transformations and practices the workings of ghosts and spirits.\n\nThose of old who skillfully managed petty men always followed the momentum of their expansion, remained still outside affairs, and gradually halted their advance. Thus the *Book of Changes* says: *“Follow and halt them—this is observing the image.”* In the time of stripping, follow and halt to observe heaven’s waxing and waning, the fullness of yin and the emptiness of yang. The gentleman follows heaven’s course and halts. He does not dare to be rigidly upright: following is how he halts, and halting is how he acts. Stripping does not advance; in *Fu*, advancing is favorable—there is no second way. The great fruit is not eaten—this is halting. Why is it not eaten? The fruit is yang. Yang cannot be stripped and advanced by yin; thus when stripping reaches its limit, it turns to *Fu*. Petty men lose their shelter and also follow the times to halt.\n\nThis is why Guanyin deploys Erlang: precisely to observe heaven’s course and follow its expanding momentum to gradually observe its halting—not to aid yin in dissolving yang. She does not use the pure vase to strike the Great Sage but has Laozi use the diamond chisel: precisely to remain still outside affairs, follow heaven’s course, and halt the stripping—to halt yin and rescue yang.\n\nYet stripping and halting are both heaven’s course. Following its stripping and halting it are both observing heaven’s course. In truth, the Great Sage’s observation is his own observation, merely borrowing Guanyin to expound the principle; his halting is his own halting, merely borrowing Laozi to reveal the meaning; his stripping is his own stripping, merely borrowing Erlang to follow its course. In truth, the stripping is not the Great Sage’s own stripping—he merely borrows the Great Sage to clarify heaven’s Dao of stripping.",

Erlang lunged forward to peck once more—still using his beak. The Great Sage became a water snake, slithering into the grass, neither viper nor serpent—concealed in the wild thickets. Erlang transformed into a gray crane, stretching forth a long beak like a pair of sharp-tipped iron pincers. Alas!",

      "translated_text": "To reproach others is to have each strip themselves as warning of their peril. Knowing the stripping and following its halt, knowing the following of its halt and its necessary return, knowing its necessary return—thus the Dao is made clear.\n\nGuanyin pressed her palms together and said, “This humble monk requests that Your Majesty accompany the Dao Ancestor to the Southern Gate of Heaven to see for yourselves the truth of the matter.” This is precisely to observe the truth of heaven’s Dao in yin and yang. The Two Sages encircled the Great Sage but had yet to capture him—“the great fruit remains uneaten.” The pure vase was not used, preserving its immaculate clarity so that the body does not engage, a divine observation.\n\nThe Bodhisattva asked Laozi, “What weapons do you have?” Laozi replied, “I have, I have, I have.” From his left arm he took down a ring, called the *Diamond Chisel*, also named the *Diamond Noose*. This is the “golden hook” and “jade hook” of the *Ding* hexagram’s sixth line, fifth and top lines. The subtlety lies in the threefold “I have, I have, I have.” For the *Ding*’s fifth line, the hollow center is yellow, representing the ruler as solid. The fifth is empty, taking the second line’s solidity as its own solidity—thus Guanyin asks from her emptiness, and Laozi answers from his fullness.\n\nAll things move by their feet, but the *Ding* alone moves by its ears. The sixth line’s hollow center is virtue, forming the yellow ear-hook. Adding ears responds to the second line’s firm hardness. Like threading with a golden hook, it must remain consistent from beginning to end. In steadfastness, it is beneficial—thus solid yet hollow, hollow yet round, forming a ring. The top line’s jade hook, with yang on the left residing in yin, hard yet yielding, is tempered like jade, warm yet solemn. Thus, from the left arm comes the *Diamond Chisel*, gold conjoined with jade.\n\nWhy can it noose all things and be called a noose? The fifth line is hollow at its center, and emptiness can contain. The top is the elder, the fifth the ruler—thus it is Laozi. Only Laozi’s emptiness within and solidity without can subdue the upright and halt change. Erlang could not consume the Great Sage’s fruit, but the Great Sage could consume Laozi’s center, striking his heavenly crown and stumbling. Laozi’s following and halting is the Great Sage’s own following and halting. The hound’s bite sent him sprawling again—Erlang’s following and halting is the Great Sage’s own following and halting. The hound is *xu* (the dog), the eleventh earthly branch. The hexagram of the ninth month has *kun* within and *gen* without, following the season to halt. To act against the season is to halt in motion; to follow the season in halting is to move in stillness. The Great Sage’s entrapment and halt is precisely his own halting and movement.\n\nThe Seven Sages are the seven yin lines returning from *fu*. Piercing the *pipa* bones so he could no longer transform—this is the *Bo* hexagram. Halting the top line so the great fruit remains uneaten preserves the yang within the fruit to turn and restore *Kai Tai*. It halts where it cannot but halt. The halting without change is the Great Sage’s wondrous use of the primordial, not Erlang’s ability to pierce and restrain him.\n\nThose who study the Dao and can observe its subtleties, who can establish themselves in the formless and wordless, embody Guanyin’s divine marvel—acting in yin without revealing it to others. In observation, the meaning is vast indeed!\n\nThe Immortal Master used the Great Sage and Lesser Sage to elucidate the Dao of the Golden Elixir, while I, with the Confucian Dao, elucidate the Lesser Sage and Great Sage, though I have not exhausted its wonders. I cannot but conclude: the Lesser Sage follows heaven and embodies *kun* yin. Viewed through the primordial Dao, in the later heaven it is the male. The Great Sage defies heaven and embodies *qian* yang. Viewed through the primordial Dao, in the later heaven it is the female. To follow heaven is to rebel against the Heavenly Palace; to punish rebellion is to embrace yin softness. Laozi, as the master of harmony, instead aids yin in restraining yang—the Golden Elixir operates in reversal. Thus, how can I speak of its wonders? I merely observe.",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Seven: The Great Sage Escapes the Eight-Trigrams Furnace; The Mind-Ape is Tamed Beneath the Five Elements Mountain**\n\nWu Yizi said: This concludes the preceding discussion of the primordial True Unity’s *qi*, which arises from Nonbeing into Being, from Being returns to Nonbeing, from Nonbeing once more emerges, and from this re-emergence attains Supreme Harmony. Supreme Harmony gives rise to *Qian*, *Qian* to *Gou*, *Gou* to *Pi*, *Pi* to *Kun*, and *Kun* to *Fu*—endlessly cycling, beginning anew, enduring through ten thousand kalpas.\n\nThe primordial is refined within the later heaven; the later heaven conceals the marvels of the primordial. The Immortal Master revealed these truths to the world through the later heaven’s Eight Trigrams and Five Phases, that people might observe, awaken, and cultivate this singular *qi* to transcend birth and death.\n\nThe Ancestor of Unity is Nonbeing; Nonbeing generates the One, and the One extends to Ten. The sequence of yin-yang circulation—One, Two, Three, Four, Five—is the true reckoning. Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten are but their complements. The reckoning culminates at Five, yet Five resides within One, Two, Three, Four; Three and Four reside within Two; and Two resides within One. Grasp the One, and the hundred follow; perform ten thousand virtues, yet never depart from the One. The hundred, thousand, myriad, and billion never stray from One or Five.\n\nSpeaking of the numerical flow of the Five Phases: Heaven-One, Earth-Two; Heaven-Three, Earth-Four; Heaven-Five, Earth-Six; Heaven-Seven, Earth-Eight; Heaven-Nine, Earth-Ten. Speaking of the paired reckoning of yin and yang: *Qian*-One, *Dui*-Two, *Li*-Three, *Zhen*-Four, *Xun*-Five, *Kan*-Six, *Gen*-Seven, *Kun*-Eight—none depart from the Supreme Ultimate. Thus, doubling them yields the sixty-four hexagrams; applying them to affairs yields the three hundred eighty-four lines; accumulating them, all things arise. The number one thousand five hundred twenty remains bound to the Eight Trigrams; the Eight Trigrams to the Five Phases; the Five Phases to yin and yang; yin and yang to the Supreme Ultimate; and the Supreme Ultimate to Nonbeing. Thus, the Eight Trigrams and Five Phases are ultimately One. The Immortal Master speaks of both, each bearing profound meaning.\n\nWhen he speaks of the Eight Trigrams, it is that cultivators may observe their roots within the paired trigrams—just as I, in the opening chapter, presented a diagram to verify the Dao. The Immortal Master long ago made this clear. Let us first clarify the purport of the Great Sage’s escape from the furnace.\n\nIn the elixir practice, there is the tripod and the furnace: the upper is the tripod, the lower the furnace. The meaning of the tripod was subtly indicated by the Immortal Master in the preceding chapter, lifting the word “observe” to prompt discernment—not through convoluted spirits and gods, nor can its marvels be fathomed. The meaning of the furnace likewise cannot be fathomed through such convolutions. For within the later heaven’s Eight Trigrams lies the primordial *qi*. The Great Sage, with divine insight, grasped its firing times.\n\nLord Lao, wielding the Central Yellow of the tripod, struck the Great Sage’s primordial spirit to subdue him, relying on Erlang’s true earth and the hound’s steadfastness—like an eagle seizing a hare. Yet without the refining fire’s work, he could not be fully subdued. Nor could ordinary fire or the fire and thunder deities’ flames forcibly tame him; only the true fire of the Eight-Trigrams Furnace could refine him into elixir. As the Perfected One of Purple Yang said: *“There is a natural true firing time—what need for kindling or bellows?”* Thus, the deities of the fire and thunder departments could not harm him; only Lord Lao could lead him away, cast him into the Eight-Trigrams Furnace, and refine the elixir with civil and martial fire.\n\nThe Great Sage, entering the furnace, burrowed beneath the *Xun* palace. *Xun* is the eldest daughter, the way of softness—manifesting the image of King Wen imprisoned in Youli. Only through yielding compliance could he unfold the primordial Eight Trigrams, ultimately unharmed. Wind stirred the smoke, scorching his eyes red—yet this revealed injury, while concealing brilliance nurtured obscurity, rightly employing clarity without harm. Hence it is said: *“Later called ‘fiery eyes and golden pupils.’”*\n\nWhen the firing time was complete, the furnace was opened to retrieve the elixir. Suddenly, a sound arose from the furnace’s head, light blazed forth, and with a crash, the Eight-Trigrams Furnace was overturned. The Great Sage bolted outward like a white-browed tiger or a one-horned dragon—these two images of dragon and tiger now united as one. Lord Lao tumbled headfirst, barely escaping. Alas!",

      "translated_text": "Marvelous, wondrous indeed! Earlier, Lord Lao struck the Great Sage’s Heavenly Crown with the crucible’s handle, causing him to stumble; now, Lord Lao tumbled headfirst while the Great Sage broke free. The former was the Golden Elixir’s compliance within the crucible to form the embryo; this is the Golden Elixir’s reversal from the furnace to cast off the embryo. The immortal master’s verse, *“The Primordial Body perfectly accords with the Prior Heaven,”* precisely depicts the marvel of elixir completion—each word a pearl of wisdom. The most crucial points of discernment lie in the phrases *“styled the First Mystery,”* *“not lead and mercury,”* and *“returning to transformation.”* For the mystery within the Mystery defies exhaustive speech. This is called *“styled the First Mystery,”* yet there remains something beyond; *“not lead and mercury,”* yet lead and mercury are still required. This is said to *“return to transformation,”* yet further transformation remains.\n\nLaozi said: *“Mystery upon mystery—the gateway to all wonders.”* The first Mystery is already so intricate as to elude comprehension, and the second Mystery is even more so. Thus, the immortal master particularly emphasizes the phrase *“greatly disturbing the Heavenly Palace.”* Another verse contains two *“again”*s, precisely capturing the essence of *“Mystery upon Mystery.”* Why, then, did he once more wreak havoc in the Heavenly Palace? When the Prior Heaven’s true *yi*-essence enters the Eight Trigrams, it follows the timing of the Posterior Heaven; when it emerges beyond the Eight Trigrams, it precedes Heaven, and Heaven cannot oppose it. It contends with Heaven for its seat, unbound by Heaven’s dominion.\n\nEarlier, the Great Sage’s disturbance of the Heavenly Palace led to his tempering within the furnace—first movement, then stillness, the initial phase of the work. This is the first Mystery. Now, the Great Sage’s renewed disturbance of the Heavenly Palace, followed by his confinement beneath the mountain, is stillness at its extreme giving rise to movement, and movement returning to stillness—the latter phase of the work. This is the Mystery upon Mystery. Yet while the first disturbance could be subdued by Lord Lao’s crucible, this one could only be quelled by Tathāgata’s palm. The former relied on the oppositional Eight Trigrams, the latter on the clustered Five Phases; though their methods of restraint differ, their wondrous function is one.\n\nMost marvelous are the four lines of another verse. Readers must understand: the ape is paired with the heart, the heart is the ape—tightly bound and securely tethered, allowing no external pursuit. Thus, commentators on *Journey to the West* encapsulate the entire book with the four characters *“heart-ape, intent-horse,”* unaware that the ape is the Dao-body. The ape’s nature is slow, governing stillness; the monkey’s nature is restless, governing movement. This illustrates the Dao-body’s alternation between movement and stillness, corresponding to the human heart’s alternation between movement and stillness—not that the ape and monkey *are* the human heart. When the immortal master’s outline speaks of the *“heart-ape,”* saying the heart is the ape or monkey, the meaning is profound and demands the reader’s discernment.\n\nIf the heart is simply the ape or monkey, the expression is plain and shallow—why then the phrase *“profound meaning”*? For the Dao-body has stillness and movement, and the cultivator likewise has stillness and movement. Movement at its extreme must return to stillness, stillness at its extreme must give rise to movement, and movement at its extreme must return to stillness. The entire process of the Golden Elixir is contained herein—this is *“Mystery upon mystery, the gateway to all wonders.”* Hence, it is called *“profound meaning.”*\n\nWhy does the third line speak of uniting movement with stillness without mentioning the ape’s heart uniting with intent, but only the heart? Because in the Golden Elixir’s work, at the moment when stillness at its extreme gives rise to movement, one must subdue the monkey’s movement and pacify the ape’s stillness to accomplish the Great Dao. Thus, before the horse and ape unite, before heart and intent harmonize, one cannot be tightly bound and securely tethered but must be guided externally. Only when horse and ape unite, when heart and intent harmonize, can one be tightly bound and securely tethered, allowing no external pursuit.\n\nThe Great Sage’s transformation into three heads and six arms, dancing within the core, enduring through all ages, and eluding the grasp of divine generals—this precisely depicts the marvel of the Dao-body’s transformations. Those who interpret this as concerning the heart err greatly. Yet the Dao is no ordinary Dao; those who cultivate and subdue it become Tathāgatas. One must thoroughly investigate its origins before proceeding.\n\nThe Great Sage himself declared his spirit’s primordial root-source as the essence of the Prior Heaven, no mundane thing—this alone emboldened him to contend for precedence. In a single phrase, he revealed that while Heaven is of the Prior Heaven, so too is he. Thus, he dared to contend for precedence without yielding.\n\nWhen the Great Sage was lured into submission, it was precisely the moment for the Golden Elixir’s inception. The five fleshy pillars and a wisp of azure *qi* corresponded to the time when heart and intent clustered the Five Phases. The inscription *“The Great Sage Equaling Heaven was here”* on the central pillar is what the Buddha referred to as: *“Within the cosmos, between heaven and earth, there lies a precious secret in the mountain of form—not in the heart or kidneys, but in the mysterious pass of the single aperture.”* Thus, he could not escape Tathāgata’s palm and remained within the Five Phases.\n\nWhen the Buddha flipped his palm and thrust him beyond the Western Heaven’s gate, transforming the Five Phases Mountain to press him down, he clearly demonstrated that the path of the Golden Elixir must cluster the Five Phases to crystallize from emptiness. The human heart, attaining this alignment, gains a foundation and does not fall into oblivion. As *The Great Learning* states: *“Know where to rest, and you will be settled; settled, you will be tranquil; tranquil, you will be at peace; at peace, you may act without striving, gradually refining and transcending.”* The chapter’s subjugation of the demonic monkey and the grand assembly to pacify Heaven precisely embodies the principle of settled tranquility and peace.\n\n*The Awakening to Reality* says:\n*“Swallowing saliva and absorbing qi are human practices,\nOnly with substance can transformation arise.\nIf the crucible lacks the true seed,\nIt is like boiling water and fire in an empty cauldron.”*\nThe Great Sage is the true seed. For activity is the function of non-activity, and non-activity is the root of activity. One must first engage in activity and then return to non-activity to complete the wondrous path of the supreme, utterly real Dao. If one begins with non-activity and pursues stillness and stability, the foundation of life will not be firm, and one will ultimately fall into oblivion.",
      "overlap_context": "ly employing clarity without harm. Hence it is said: *“Later called ‘fiery eyes and golden pupils.’”*\n\nWhen the firing time was complete, the furnace was opened to retrieve the elixir. Suddenly, a sound arose from the furnace’s head, light blazed forth, and with a crash, the Eight-Trigrams Furnace was overturned. The Great Sage bolted outward like a white-browed tiger or a one-horned dragon—these two images of dragon and tiger now united as one. Lord Lao tumbled headfirst, barely escaping. Alas!",

      "translated_text": "Should one engage in activity yet fail to transcend, the ground of inherent nature remains unemptied, still bound within the Three Realms. The Perfected Lord of Purple Yang states:\n\n*“At first, with effort, few perceive its worth,\nOnly when effortless do all acknowledge its grace.\nThough effortless seems the wondrous key,\nWho knows that effort is the root’s embrace?”*\n\nThe one who acts is the Mind-Ape beneath Five Phases Mountain. The one who acts yet abides in non-action is the settled Mind-Ape beneath Five Phases Mountain. Throughout the text, from the monkey’s transformation into a spirit to the final passages where “monkey” recurs without mention of “ape,” it precisely reveals the principle that only after taming the monkey can the ape’s stillness be attained. As for Five Phases Mountain taking root and sealing seamlessly, responding to the breath of mortals—this is the Golden Elixir swallowed into the belly. Hunger met with iron pellets, thirst with molten bronze—both are of the metal class. The ape is metal within water, embodying the principle of like aiding like, is this not the work of nurturing unity and embracing the One?\n\nThus, observing the Tathāgata’s palm-turning subjugation of the ape, one may awaken to the truth that within the postnatal Five Phases lies the prenatal true essence of the One, requiring no distant quest—easily subdued as the turning of a palm.\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Buddha Composes the Sūtra to Transmit Ultimate Bliss; Guanyin Receives the Edict to Journey to Chang’an**\n\nWu Yizi says: The first seven chapters elucidate the Great Way of the Golden Elixir, which is cultivated through refining the prenatal true qi of the One. Its alchemical method, origins, firing times, beginning and end, secret techniques for commencement—all are encompassed without omission. Those who study the Dao, through silent observation and careful reflection, with a master’s guidance, may together realize bodhi and ascend to immortality.\n\nThe Immortal Master feared that the world’s foolish might believe immortals and buddhas are born, not attainable by ordinary beings through cultivation; or that enlightenment lies solely in the mind, attainable by oneself alone. Thus, the following text presents Xuanzang as an exemplar, and Sun Wukong, Zhu Wuneng, Sha Wujing, and the Dragon Horse as agents of transformation—demonstrating that immortality and buddhahood are within everyone’s reach, not innate or fixed; that mutual aid, not solitary practice, is the path.\n\nYet the text’s trials and monsters, its perils and hardships—spanning one hundred and eight thousand miles, eighty-one ordeals, and fourteen years—may well evoke fear, doubt, and hesitation, leading one to believe such a journey impossible, such tribulations inescapable, such merit unattainable. If so, then *Journey to the West* would become an obstacle, deterring seekers.\n\nThe Immortal Master’s intent in writing is to reveal that without true transmission, one faces endless trials and extreme suffering; with true transmission, one attains eternal bliss. Hence the chapter’s theme: *“The Buddha composes the sūtra to transmit ultimate bliss.”* It aims to rescue those undergoing trials with what is most proximate and effortless. For with this sūtra’s existence, one may avoid the remoteness of one hundred and eight thousand miles, the perils of eighty-one ordeals, and the protraction of fourteen years.\n\nThe opening chapter’s bold declaration—*“Journey to the West to release from tribulation”*—makes clear that the journey’s purpose is liberation, not the imposition of hardship. Yet the trials and tribulations arise because Xuanzang has not yet received true transmission. One might assume enlightenment comes only after reaching Vulture Peak, meeting the Buddha, and receiving the sūtra. How then does he shed his mortal form and attain realization at Cloud-Soaring Crossing?\n\nIt is not known that the Bodhisattva, upon receiving the edict to seek a monk, had already bestowed five treasures, instructed him to subdue his three disciples, and prepared his mount. Xuanzang had secretly received the *Tight-Fillet* incantation. The transmission of the true sūtra had already occurred when the Bodhisattva set forth for Chang’an—there was no need to reach the Western Heaven to attain the Dao.\n\nThe text’s insistence on the journey to the West merely points to the source of the Great Way; the one hundred and eight thousand miles, eighty-one ordeals, and fourteen years illustrate the critical importance of vigilance against danger, the stages of progress, and the firing times. The distance is not inherently far—it arises from insufficient effort in bearing the load, from taking the easy path of haste. Recognizing that one hundred and eight thousand miles are not truly distant, one sees the Dao before one’s eyes; the sudden awakening arrives with a single somersault.\n\nThe difficulty is not inherent—it arises from delusion by worldly ties, from the unevenness of leaks and gaps. Understanding that eighty-one ordeals are easily resolved, one finds boundless joy; the greatly courageous need only a single strike of the golden cudgel to conclude them.\n\nThe duration is not inherently long—it arises from ignorance of the firing times of medicinal substances and the subtleties of weights and measures. Knowing that fourteen years are not truly long, one may swiftly attain the sūtra; the adept, with the golden fillet’s restraint, is already within my grasp.\n\nWithout experiencing the extremity of suffering, one cannot know the truth of ultimate bliss; without enduring the bitterness of extreme suffering, one cannot know the joy of ultimate bliss. Without traversing one hundred and eight thousand miles, eighty-one ordeals, and fourteen years of remoteness, peril, and duration, one cannot comprehend that nine nines reduce to one nine, two treasuries to one treasury, five thousand forty-eight days to a single firing time.\n\nThis sūtra originates from the *Yinfu Jing* and the *Daode Jing*, composed by the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. The Immortal Master merely entrusted the Buddha with expounding its teachings, the Tang era with disseminating its practice, Xuanzang with exemplifying its standard, and *Journey to the West* with unfolding its meaning—using allegory to reveal its essence.\n\nIf one were to insist that only by journeying to the West to fetch the sūtra, as Xuanzang did, can the Dao be attained, then the ancient past would lack buddhas and immortals, and future generations would be cut off from the seeds of buddhahood and immortality. Such a path would be excessively complex, difficult, and abstruse—unattainable by all—rather than the simplest, easiest, and most immediate Way, accessible to all. This would contravene the Buddha’s compassionate intent in transmitting the sūtra.",

      "translated_text": "The Buddha’s transmission of the sūtra encompasses two wondrous meanings: for those who have yet to attain the Dao, it directs them to journey west like Xuanzang to fetch the sūtra; for those who have already attained the Dao, it guides them, like awakening, to reach the West and return to the Buddha. Though the methods differ, the transmission is one, and the transmission leads to one Ultimate Bliss. The subtlety of the sūtra’s essence lies in the discernment of the enlightened mind—thus, only the divine insight of Guanyin Bodhisattva can truly uphold its practice.\n\nThe opening verse speaks of those who meditate in dark contemplation, wasting effort in vain pursuits: like \"grinding a brick to make a mirror,\" it cannot reflect form; like \"piling snow for grain,\" it cannot sate hunger. They toil until old age without achievement, leading the young astray. Such sayings as \"a hair swallowing the great sea\" or \"a mustard seed containing Mount Sumeru\" are baseless claims—even the \"Golden-Headed Ascetic\" would but smile in quiet amusement. If one awakens to this truth, they \"transcend the Ten Grounds and the Three Vehicles\"; if one remains mired in delusion, they fall into the \"Four Births and Six Paths,\" trapped in the wheel of rebirth for ten thousand kalpas, unable to escape.\n\nWho can hear the spring message of the cuckoo’s call at \"Cliff of No-Thought\" beneath the \"Shadeless Tree,\" suddenly shattering the dawn dream? Thus, the \"path to Caoxi is perilous\" and impassable; the \"clouds of Vulture Peak are deep\" and unreachable. Boundless and formless, it defies grasp. Here, the voices of old friends fade into silence—yet know this: amid the \"thousand-foot ice cliffs,\" the \"five-petaled lotus blooms,\" rising transcendent, its fragrance curling through ancient curtains and lingering upon timeworn silks.\n\nIf one can \"discern the source and flow\" herein, they will perceive the Dragon King’s three treasures and may then obtain the elixir, becoming immortal and buddha. How could mere meditation at the gate of Chan ever glimpse its depths? For Chan seeks only within the nature of the essence, neglecting the root of life—wasting endless effort until, in old age, one merges into the great transformation. How lamentable! How pitiful! They neither recognize the affair of the \"Mind-Ape beneath the Five Phases Mountain\" nor understand the matter of \"taming the Mind-Ape beneath the Five Phases Mountain.\"\n\nThus, when the Tathāgata returned to the Thunderclap Jeweled Monastery, he addressed all buddhas and bodhisattvas: \"With my profound, subtle, and wondrous compassion and prajñā, I survey the Three Realms. The fundamental nature of the root is ultimately quiescent, identical to the emptiness of space, utterly devoid of anything.\" By \"fundamental nature of the root,\" he means the original face. Though it is difficult to directly enter quiescence, by focusing on the nature of the essence in cultivation, one may, upon attaining the Dao, perceive that the original nature is ultimately quiescent—\"identical to the emptiness of space, utterly devoid of anything.\" \"Identical to the emptiness of space\" does not mean inert emptiness; \"utterly devoid of anything\" does not mean absolute nothingness.\n\nThe matter of subduing the rebellious monkey is known to none in the Three Realms. This matter is most true and most wondrous, neither quiescent nor inertly empty—it is merely that \"names arise with the beginning of birth and death,\" and the dharma’s appearance accords with this. If one claims the original nature is inherently empty and fails to recognize this matter, then it is not my profound teaching but merely clinging to quiescence, which is quiescence alone.\n\nLaozi said: \"The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth; the named is the mother of the myriad things.\" The nameless is death, the beginning of heaven and earth; the named is birth, entering into the Five Phases. The rebellious monkey is \"named birth and death’s beginning,\" its dharma-appearance deviating from the root source of its original nature—thus it cannot escape the Tathāgata’s palm or transcend beyond the Five Phases.\n\nIn the Buddha’s Ullambana jeweled basin, a hundred rare flowers and a thousand wondrous fruits are arrayed—this is the \"named, mother of the myriad things,\" the image of returning to the origin after purity. This inquiry is the meaning of the Buddha’s words: \"I possess a treasure, hidden within the mountain of form—do any of you recognize it?\" Thus, the assembly entreated the Tathāgata to \"clearly reveal the root,\" and the Tathāgata \"proclaimed the true fruit,\" unfolding the wondrous mysteries of the Three and Five. The Chan mind is the bright moon; the true nature embraces heaven—this is the true sūtra of the Three Treasuries of heaven, earth, and spirits.\n\nIn sum: the Three Treasuries are but the Three and Five; the Three and Five are but the One and Five; the One and Five are but the One. This One is the direct path of cultivating truth, the gate of true goodness. This sūtra, originating in the West, must await retrieval from the East—only one with the silent observation and secret discernment of a great being like Guanyin can obtain it.\n\nThe Tathāgata said: \"On this journey, you must tread carefully, not traveling in the clouds but keeping to half-cloud, half-mist, meticulously noting the distance of the path.\" This means the cultivator must proceed with grounded steps, advancing gradually, not indulging in empty fantasies or skipping stages. Yet one must also be fluid and spiritually attuned, free from attachment, for within it lies the sequence of fire-times and stages of practice—these must be carefully remembered and not transgressed.\n\nAmong the five treasures is \"a brocade kāṣāya robe.\" The kāṣāya is the garment of non-defilement. \"Brocade\" is woven from deep threads of five colors. In the five colors, it is blue, yellow, red, white, and black; in the five virtues, it is benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust; in the Five Phases, it is metal, wood, water, fire, and earth; in the five relationships, it is ruler-minister, father-son, husband-wife, elder-younger brothers, and friends; in the five directions, it is east, west, south, north, and center; in the five tones, it is gong, shang, jue, zhi, and yu; in the five flavors, it is salty, bitter, sour, spicy, and sweet; in the five seasons, it is spring, summer, autumn, winter, and the four seasons—extending to the five officials, five grains, and more, all of which cannot be exhaustively described. Yet all are but the One and Five, all are the treasure of \"a single brocade kāṣāya robe.\"",

      "translated_text": "\"A 'nine-ringed monastic staff,' the rings symbolizing the image of perfect completion without end. In the principles of numerology, it is cyclical recurrence; in yin and yang, it is the ebb and flow; in the firing times of alchemy, it is the nine rings; in substance and function, it is the interlocking chain; in the four corners, it is encirclement; in spirits and deities, it is contraction and extension; in Heaven and Earth, it is their efficacy; in life and death, it is beginning and end; in the four directions, it is unimpeded passage; in the unfathomable concealment and revelation, it is wisdom; in adapting to circumstances and responding to opportunities, it is expedient means—all residing within the One and Five, all the treasure of 'a nine-ringed monastic staff.'\n\nThese two treasures—one embodying completeness, the other efficacy—are why those who come here with steadfast resolve to seek the sutras may don the robe to escape the cycle of rebirth and wield the staff to avoid harm from poisons.\n\nThen there are the three bands, 'called the *tightening bands*, though identical in form, each serves a different purpose.' There are also the three incantations: 'Gold,' 'Tight,' and 'Forbid.' Gold signifies restraint, the measure of advance and retreat. Through gold’s restraint, none may evade its control. One is used to subdue the Great Sage, employing restraint as the means; another to subdue the Black Bear, using non-greed as restraint; and another to subdue Sudhana, using virtuous relinquishment as restraint. Though their applications differ, the method of tight restraint remains the same. This is the esoteric essence of elixir refinement. When lesser practitioners hear of it, they cannot but laugh in derision, so the immortal master conceals rather than explicates it. Why? Those who cultivate the Dao must purge all worldly entanglements, remaining unstained by even a speck of dust. Gold is the first thing to be restrained—this accords with common understanding, and all would readily accept it as true. Yet few realize that if gold’s primary function were abandoned even for a moment, one would become unrestrained and uncontrollable, unable to guide others into one’s own gate. Thus, gold must be employed first, and restraint must be tight, to prevent the peril of transgression and recklessness. Why? Because gold is something all see and readily assent to, something that catches the eye and stirs the mind. Once the thought of gold arises, the eyes grow dim and the mind agitated, leaving no room for leniency—one cannot but submit to gold’s command. The Perfected One said: 'To seek the treasure of Heaven, one must use the wealth of the world.' This is the esoteric essence. Though gold is of a single nature, its uses differ, and the thoughts it evokes vary, yet the method of tight restraint remains constant. If the worldly abandon restraint and transgress bounds, the sage enacts golden statutes to restrain them—another method of establishing boundaries.\n\nThis revelation may strike some as far-fetched, prompting laughter, but observe the passage: 'If he will not submit to your command, give him this band. Once worn on the head, it will naturally take root in the flesh. Recite the appropriate incantation, and he will be brought into my fold.' The meaning is quite clear. Thus, even if one does not begrudge the use of gold, the 'Gold, Tight, Forbid' restraints do not contradict the earlier explanation of common principles. Those who grasp this—devotees at the foot of Vulture Peak, the Golden Summit Immortals, who seek the Dao with unwavering resolve—may attain this state within two or three years. This is the true teaching. Swift attainment of the Dao is indeed possible, though the fourteen-year period is not an immutable term.\n\nYet among these five items, three remain, still embodying the meaning of Three and Five—this must not be overlooked. From this point, Sha Wujing manifests.\n\nThis Sha Wujing is the most essential and wondrous aspect of the elixir path, though readers often misconstrue him. Liu Zongyuan wrote: 'In the mountains of the Western Sea, there is a water so weak and diffuse it cannot bear even a mustard seed, sinking only when it reaches the bottom. Thus it is called *Weak Water*.' Yang Xiong’s *Rhapsody on the Sweet Springs* speaks of 'the eastern glow illuminating the Eastern Sea, the western radiance shining upon the Flowing Sands.' Weak Water and Flowing Sands are actual place names in the Western Regions, but the immortal master employs them as metaphors: the passions are easily drowned, the foundation of inherent nature is hard to stabilize, and one must rely on true earth to solidify it. True earth is true intention; Flowing Sands are earth without constancy. True earth is formless yet pervades the nine palaces. Without it, water, metal, wood, and fire cannot harmonize—its efficacy is unparalleled, hence the name 'Sha Monk.'\n\nAs for the title 'Roll-Curtain General,' the 'shattering of the glass goblet at the Peach Banquet,' the 'once every seven days, a flying sword pierces my ribs,' and 'what choice was there but to seek sustenance from travelers'—these seem devoid of meaning, yet profound significance lies within. The curtain separates inner and outer, safeguarding integrity and modesty, yet he carelessly rolled it up without scruple. The 'Peach Banquet' is meant to foster joyous harmony. The 'glass goblet,' formed from a thousand years of distilled water, is the supreme treasure of the West, the sole means of fostering harmony. His lack of sincerity caused him to shatter it, forfeiting that harmony, profaning the treasure, and neglecting his duty—his offense was grave. The 'seven days' mark the return of Heaven’s will. In the quiet of night, reflecting on the hidden recesses of his own conduct, he felt remorse and pain as if pierced by a flying sword. Was he not merely consuming the flesh of the sutra-seekers, becoming a useless demon? His 'nine skulls' symbolize the true earth of the nine palaces, so water cannot sink them. 'The sutra-seeker will find use for them'—their wondrous application will be detailed when he is subdued.\n\nHere, 'taking the sands as his surname,' he is named 'Sha Wujing,' 'enters the *sha* gate,' and 'purifies his mind and cleanses his thoughts, never again harming life.' From this, we know that to take refuge in the Pure Land, one must employ true intention and sincerity, avoiding carelessness that leads to harming life.\"",

The pig belongs to *hai*, and within *hai* resides *jia*-wood. Wood can generate fire, hence the term “speech-ability.” The character *hai* (亥) contains *yi* (乙), signifying gestation, and *er ren* (二人), representing male and female.

      "translated_text": "From ancient times to the present, those who revere this tale as a guide take the ape as the heart and the horse as the mind. Yet if one claims the horse is the mind—since the heart is the essence of the mind, and the mind is the function of the heart—then all the wondrous and unfathomable feats, such as \"Great Sage Equaling Heaven\" wreaking havoc in the Heavenly Palace or the somersault cloud, should rightly be attributed to the White Horse. Why then are they solely ascribed to the ape? This reveals that the White Horse cannot be the mind.\n\nThe White Horse is a metal symbol, a dragon-horse. *Qian* represents the dragon and the horse. The horse is a creature of pure *Qian*, embodying the ceaseless vigor of *Qian*. Thus, those who cultivate the Dao must emulate the unrelenting diligence of *Qian*, possessing the great strength and burden-bearing capacity of the dragon-horse, only then can they journey to the West and obtain the scriptures. Ordinary horses, lacking such power, are inevitably hindered by Eagle Sorrow Gorge. If the horse were indeed the mind, would not those lesser horses also qualify? Yet why are they devoured by the dragon-horse, necessitating its presence?\n\nHowever, another crucial principle must be clarified: for those who cultivate the Dao, taming the dragon is the foremost task. If one indulges in reckless abandon, they destroy their own luminous pearl, becoming a malevolent dragon. With unstable roots, how can one bear the Dao or travel far? Therefore, one must retreat into the deep abyss, conceal brilliance, and nurture obscurity, only then can their potential be properly harnessed. From this point, the Great Sage emerges from concealment.\n\nThe marvels of the innate true *yi* have been thoroughly expounded earlier, and need not be reiterated. To summarize clearly: wood, numbered three, resides in the East; fire, numbered two, resides in the South. Wood generates fire, and these two elements share the same palace, thus two and three combine to form five. *Wuneng* (*Hai*) unites water and fire as one family. Metal, numbered four, resides in the West; water, numbered one, resides in the North. Metal generates water, and these two elements share the same palace, thus four and one combine to form five. *Wukong* (*Shen*) unites metal and water as one family. *Wu* and *Ji*, inherently the generative number five, form the three fives. *Wujing* embodies the earth family, and the union of the three fives becomes the Supreme Ultimate.\n\n*Tai* signifies the utmost greatness; *ji* denotes the utmost essential. Its principle lies within primordial chaos, and with a single movement, yin and yang are born. Yin and yang are *qi*. This is the principle that gives rise to *qi*, and *qi* in turn embodies the principle. Only with the *qi* of the innate true *yi* can the three families be generated; after the three families converge, they in turn generate the *qi* of the innate true *yi*, forming the spiritual infant. The infant relies entirely on the operation of this *qi* to shed its mortal form and become a true person.\n\n*Xuanzang* is this infant, thus he cannot be separated from *Wukong*; indeed, neither *Wuneng* nor *Wujing* can be separated from *Wukong*. As the *Wuzhen Pian* states: “East three and South two together make five, North one and West four share the same. *Wu* and *Ji* inherently reside in the generative number five; the three families converge to form the spiritual infant.” This is the true essence.

      "translated_text": "How could the mother of a *zhuangyuan* be reduced to living alone in a foreign land? Would the daughter of a prime minister lack an escort when assuming office? A prefect’s wife could never secretly appear by the riverside. A single plank as a raft—hardly a sound plan to safeguard an infant. The beloved daughter won by the bride-selecting ball—why would she vanish without a trace? The doting mother of an official in office—how could she become a beggar after parting? Even if constrained by bureaucratic rank, how could there be no promotion for eighteen full years? Though kin and acquaintances may be few, could there truly be no word at all from even the most distant relation? Seeking one’s mother and recognizing her—how could one simply stride into the inner yamen? Pouring out one’s heart so freely—could it be that in a city of such size, with its cold officials and desolate offices, there were no gatekeepers to bar entry, no servants or maids in attendance? And once the scheme unraveled and capture was imminent, how could one muster an army of sixty thousand? Such manifold absurdities weary the reader’s ear. Earlier scholars have often excised this chapter, deeming it dispensable.\n\nAlas! The immortal master’s learning spans past and present; his breast encompasses the workings of creation. He is intimately versed in the ways of the world and human sentiment, in the canons and measures of governance—would he ever wield such a careless brush? Nay, the immortal master’s profound intent and sublime expression lie precisely here, beyond the ken of ordinary minds. For he traces straight to the origins of Xuanzang’s parents’ birth, thereby illuminating the foundational workings of the Golden Elixir’s great Dao. The eighty-one trials of later chapters are rooted in this; the attainment of true fruition is rooted in this. All revolves around saving the golden carp—water giving rise to metal, the principle of inversion and reversal.\n\nMetal can generate water, yet without water, it falls to the butcher’s block and cannot preserve its life. Water can generate metal, and with metal, it connects to the divine and can even revive the dead. Thus, preserving the life of metal is to preserve one’s own life; saving metal from death is to save oneself from death—this is the unifying principle, the very purpose for which Guanyin was sent to Chang’an. Hence, the mother can give birth to the child, and the child can in turn give birth to the mother. Mother and child mutually generate each other, and the alchemical method is complete.\n\nObserve: *\"In the Joyous Hall prefectural yamen, a son was born. By his ear, the Star Lord of the Southern Pole whispered, ‘By Guanyin’s dharma-decree, in days to come, husband and wife, mother and child shall reunite. Remember my words well. Awake! Awake!’\"* This is meant to awaken the world—how could it be intended for Joyous Hall alone? *\"Joyous Hall\"* is metal, the product of the mountain’s opening. *\"River Flow\"* is water, born of metal’s nurturing—metal generates water. *\"Secretly cast into the river’s edge\"*—metal generates water. *\"Flowing straight to Golden Mountain, where the raft came to rest\"*—metal generates water. *\"Seeking my mother within the Jiangzhou yamen\"*—water generates metal. *\"Rushing into the residence to rescue his mother\"*—water generates metal. *\"Xuanzang desperately tearing at the bonds\"*—water generates metal.\n\nYet without discerning the myriad falsehoods of the world, one cannot know the singular truth within water. Only the bodhisattva’s divine insight can faithfully uphold this true decree. Guanyin was sent to Chang’an to enable Chang’an to perceive the great Dao. Alas, Chang’an *\"changed its reign title to Zhenguan\"*—able only to glimpse the Dao faintly, like a woman’s chastity. With a *Zhenguan* sovereign above, the great Dao could not be perceived; below, with Wei Zheng as minister, the grand vision could not be nurtured. *\"Wei\"* sounds like *\"falsehood\"*—falsehood; *\"Zheng\"* means *\"outward verification.\"* If the vision is chaste but not great, then verification is false and not true. The transformation through reverent inaction is distant, and none in the world can perceive it. This meaning is not my own fabrication—observe how the immortal master prominently introduces the four characters *\"Zhenguan Wei Zheng\"* at the chapter’s outset, making it abundantly clear.\n\nNow examine the falsehoods in the encounters of Xuanzang’s parents: The selection of the top scholar and appointment to office—Chen Guangrui’s case—yet the one who took office was the bandit Liu Hong. Here lies the falsehood in seeking talent and employing men, plain to see. The daughter of a prime minister resorting to a bride-selecting ball to arrange her own marriage—here lies the falsehood in the proper beginnings of husband and wife, the perversion of marriage rites. An official murdered by bandits, with the brigand’s faction usurping power—rulers and ministers unaware, colleagues indifferent. Here lies the falsehood in the laws of ruler and minister. An official left unpromoted for eighteen years, allowing bandits to tyrannize the people unchecked—here lies the falsehood in the selection and appointment system. Binding a false prefect and commanding sixty thousand troops—here lies the falsehood in military governance and temple calculations. Literature as a ladder to advancement, yet unknowingly becoming a path to destruction—here lies the falsehood in literature. Office as a place to honor oneself, yet unknowingly becoming a road to ruin—here lies the falsehood in fame and achievement. Leaving one’s mother to take office, yet losing all news of life or death; seeking to honor one’s parents yet reducing them to beggary—here lies the falsehood in honor and disgrace. Taking one’s wife along, yet parting in an instant—here lies the falsehood in love and affection. Over many years, parents unable to inquire after their children’s survival, children unable to send word to their parents; kin unable to assist, friends unable to help—here lies the falsehood in family and friendship.\n\nChen Guangrui gained office and a wife—falsehood. Liu Hong gained office and a wife—falsehood within falsehood. Chen Guangrui gained the favor of ruler and people—falsehood. Liu Hong gained the favor of ruler and people—falsehood within falsehood. Chen Guangrui faced death and life—falsehood. Liu Hong faced life and death—falsehood within falsehood. Lady Zhang had a son yet had no son—falsehood in mother and child. Miss Yin had a husband yet had no husband—falsehood in husband and wife. The Kaishan couple had a daughter yet had no daughter—falsehood in filial piety and compassion.",

      "translated_text": "All this serves as proof that all is false—yet all is also a manifestation of *Zhenguan*. None of it compares to the salvation of the golden-scaled carp. That single act in the water alone could span beginning to end, reuniting flesh and blood in true and tangible fulfillment. The Way of salvation lies solely in the child born of water repaying his mother’s kindness.\n\nMiss Yin, after all, calmly cut her own throat—was this not the *zhen* (\"integrity\") she beheld? It mirrors the \"Zhenguan\" (\"True Vision\") at the chapter’s outset, bringing the core theme full circle. \"The monk Jiangliu resolved to settle into meditation\"—was this not the *da* (\"greatness\") he beheld? It reflects back upon Guanyin’s commission to journey to Chang’an, inverting the falsity of *Zhenguan*.\n\nThe key lies in one’s spiritual vision and discernment, in seeking the original face before parents were born—that is all.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Ten**\n*The Old Dragon King’s Foolish Scheme Violates Heaven’s Decree*\n*Minister Wei’s Letter Entrusted to an Underworld Official*\n\nWu Yizi says: Why do people read plain and ordinary words yet dismiss them as strange and unorthodox? It is because their vision is narrow, their steps confined. They see the Rabbit Garden but not the Lacquer Garden; they tread the azure clouds but not the Blue Ox. What they perceive is small, and where they rush is lowly.\n\nIn this chapter, the rulers and ministers of *Zhenguan* fail to attain great vision. All their deeds exist only within a dream. No one is without dreams, and none fail to recognize the illusory nature of dreams. None fail to see that worldly affairs are as illusory as dreams—so why, then, do they doubt the Tang emperor and his ministers dreaming of dragons seeking rescue, dreaming of slaying karmic dragons, dismissing it all as absurd and unorthodox?\n\nIt is not only the Tang emperor and his ministers who dream such dreams. From ancient times to the present, anyone might have such dreams. Why doubt the emperor’s decree or the minister’s intent at the time, as if they were not all willingly partaking in the same dream?\n\nThe emperor says, \"I dreamed thus.\"\nThe minister says, \"I dreamed likewise.\"\nThe generals say, \"I dreamed likewise.\"\nThe officials and attendants—who among them does not say, \"I dreamed likewise\"?\nThe entire nation, from ministers to commoners—who dares not say, \"I dreamed likewise\"?\n\nAt such a time, no one of great vision stands forth, robed in solemnity, tablet in hand, and declares: \"This is a dream, a wandering spirit’s delusion.\" One who can perceive the mind and see the nature, who grasps the supreme and truly wondrous Dao, knows that all worldly affairs are illusion—how much more so dreams!\n\nHad the Tang emperor suddenly awakened and said, \"Truly, it was a dream,\" then the dream would not recur. The Jing River would have no dragon without a head; the prime minister’s hall would lack the sword for slaying dragons; the cloud’s edge would not drop a severed head; the city gate would not display a decapitated skull. They would not die in dreams, live in dreams, and dream without end.\n\nAlas, theirs was *Zhenguan*—their vision was small. They believed the dragon had defied Heaven and sought their aid, and so they agreed to save it. They believed Heaven’s punishment was entrusted to them, and so they wielded the blade to strike. Those adept at divining the emperor’s will would surely urge, \"You can save it,\" and thus the hand would move the pieces on the board. Those skilled at aligning with the minister’s heart would surely seize the moment to offer, \"You can slay it,\" and thus the head would hang in the marketplace.\n\nIf it is a dream within a dream, awakening is still possible. Within the false, there remains truth—Guanyin saving the dragon with a willow branch is such a case. But if it is not a dream yet treated as one, there is no moment of awakening or revival. Within the false, there is only further falsehood—Wei Zheng sending a letter to Cui Jue is such a case.\n\nWei Zheng sought to interfere with Heaven’s punishments, and it is clear he would interfere with human punishments as well. He would meddle in the affairs of the underworld, and it is no stretch to see he would meddle in the affairs of the living. Where there is one falsehood, all is false; where there is one sign, all is sign—all wrought by those who cling to \"Zhenguan.\"\n\nThe Immortal Master does not mean to disparage Wei Zheng but uses him to expose the illusions of worldly affairs through the ages. There is no sign that is not false, no vision that is not *Zhenguan*. In the final analysis, it is better to be an unranked scholar, a woodsman like Zhang Yu or Li Qiao who can read and has a firm perspective. Their words say:\n\nThose who contend for fame lose their bodies for its sake;\nThose who seize profit die for its sake.\nThus, the pursuit of fame and profit by scholars and officials is false, and their striving is but a dream.\n\nThose who receive titles sleep embracing tigers;\nThose who enjoy favor run with snakes up their sleeves.\nThus, titles and favor are all false, and their acceptance is but a dream.\n\nThey also say:\n\"Take care on the road ahead, be vigilant—\nTomorrow at the street’s end, few will be familiar.\"\nHow sharp and urgent their warning!\n\nYuan Shoucheng knew the fish would swim into the net, knew fate would violate the year’s decree, knew rain would fall in due measure. Forewarned, he did not enter the dream. The Jing River dragon, deluded by the yaksha, by the broken divination, by the wager, by Marshal Shi, abandoned all caution to vie for victory, defied the law, and acted recklessly—dreaming within a dream, he plunged deeper into the dream.\n\nThe Tang emperor dreamed of a karmic dragon seeking rescue and convened his ministers to discuss the strange dream. Wei Zheng dreamed of slaying the karmic dragon and, in the emperor’s dream, left his body to wield the sword. The Tang emperor dreamed the karmic dragon demanded his life, saw ghosts and feared them—all one great dream. The civil and military officials kept night watch at the palace gates to suppress ghosts—all the court was dreaming. Even the Tang emperor’s death and Wei Zheng’s guarantee of his longevity seemed to place the Son of Heaven’s life and death in his grasp. Sending a letter to Cui Jue, he claimed, \"In a dream, I once met you,\" as if the authority of the King of Hell could be swayed by him—was this not the greatest dream of all?\n\nThus, the Tang emperor tucked the letter into his sleeve and closed his eyes, never to return. This clumsy dragon’s case was a realm of their own making, conjured in the hearts of the Tang emperor and his ministers. Its hidden signs await revelation in later chapters, but its dreamlike nature is no different from the ant in the locust tree or the deer beneath the plantain—all waking illusions.",

      "translated_text": "At first, what strangeness was there? Yet the old dragon’s clumsy scheme was never truly his own; his delayed rain-bringing invited heavenly punishment. Its profound meaning and subtle principles cannot be conveyed in mere words. A poem hints at the intent:\n\n*\"Clouds and rain bestow life upon the myriad things—\nTake care to act with precision, never tardy.\nThe clumsy dragon wagered against the mysterious decree,\nDrawing the divine blade to follow close behind.\"*\n\nThe *Yin Fu Jing* says: *\"Fire is born of wood, and calamity inevitably strikes.\"* Does this not describe such a case? Today’s temporal masters delude the world with arts of \"controlling women and waging battle,\" inviting ruin upon themselves—just as the *Shi* military advisor taught the old dragon to delay his rain, to wager and compete, defying heavenly judgment. Should we not take heed?\n\nThe Immortal Master calls him the *Shi* military advisor—its meaning is clear.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Eleven**\n*The Tang Emperor Visits the Underworld and Returns to Life;\nLiu Quan Presents Melons and Fruits to Reunite with His Wife*\n\nWu Yizi says: This chapter directly speaks of the Tang emperor’s entry into the dream to illustrate the Dao of yin-yang resonance—even the principle of exchange between man and woman. Where there is stimulus, there must be response; where there is cause, there must be effect, with not even a hair’s breadth of deviation.\n\nEmperor Gaozu of Tang once dreamed of his own death, falling beneath his bed to be devoured by maggots. The Chan master Zhipu interpreted this as a sign of the multitudes rallying to him. The present dream of Taizong is unprecedented. Yet what one does by day, one dreams by night. His journey through the underworld—was this not the hidden truth of the \"Zhenguan\" era? The evil of hidden truths, conceived in the heart and taking form in dreams—here, one must take \"the heart\" as the master, for the peril of the human heart is the peril of hell itself. Like a shadow following the body, it cannot be erased.\n\nIn this chapter:\nTaizong, lost and alone, trembles in terror, unable to find his way. In haste, he sends a private letter seeking refuge. At the Gate of Ghosts, he encounters the late Emperor Gaozu and his brothers demanding their due. He pleads the case of the clumsy dragon. The ledger of life and death is amended. He tours the underworld, heart pounding with dread. Passing through the eighteen layers of hell, his spirit quails. Gazing upon the Bridge of Helplessness, his heart again trembles. Arriving at the City of Wrongful Death, he is seized with terror. A horde of ghosts blocks his path, leaving him nowhere to hide; he begs Cui Pan for rescue and borrows Xiang Liang’s gold and silver to bribe his way free. Witnessing the Six Paths of Reincarnation, the judge urges Taizong to \"illumine his heart and perceive his nature.\" Only when the underworld is free of cries of grievance will the mortal realm enjoy the blessings of peace. Every unwholesome deed may be amended one by one.\n\nThus, the chapter’s true purport is revealed: if one refrains from unwholesome acts in the mortal world, the underworld will naturally be free of hell’s perils. Every detail is painted from the heart, all drawn from Taizong’s past deeds and the unease they stir within him. Those who critique *Journey to the West* yet overlook this chapter’s focus on the heart are truly baffling.\n\nThe most striking moment comes when the wronged souls demand retribution, and the judge says, *\"If Your Majesty offers them some money, I can save you.\"* Taizong replies, *\"I came here empty-handed—where would I get money?\"* This is what is meant by *\"Ten thousand taels of gold cannot be taken, but a lifetime of karma follows you.\"* When the judge says money can save him, does he truly mean it? No—he means that here, money cannot reach, cannot be used—how then can it save you? Later, when he borrows Xiang Liang’s gold and silver, is this truly a loan? No—it means that in the mortal world, evil deeds bring evil retribution, and good deeds bring good retribution. In the underworld, the thirteen years of an emperor’s reign are no match for the thirteen treasuries of a commoner; the fifteen circuits of an emperor’s governance are no match for the single treasury entrusted to a commoner. The profound meaning lies in the reversal—readers must not cling to the surface!\n\nIn later chapters, when Xiang Liang and his wife’s accumulated wealth is revealed to be the fruit of alms-giving and virtuous deeds—not merely gold, silver, or paper money—the truth becomes clear.\n\nTaizong enters the great dream because of the old dragon, and upon reaching the Gate of Ghosts, he should have encountered the ghostly dragon demanding his life. Why, instead, does he first meet the late Emperor Gaozu and his brothers, with no sign of the dragon? The Immortal Master embeds the intent of the *Spring and Autumn Annals* in hidden words. I reveal the unspoken meaning of *Journey to the West* to clarify what the Immortal Master left unsaid.\n\nWhen the Sui dynasty’s governance faltered, the realm pursued the deer together. Raising the banner of righteousness to overthrow tyranny and rescue the people from fire and water—this was a cause both just and right.",
      "overlap_context": "as if the authority of the King of Hell could be swayed by him—was this not the greatest dream of all?\n\nThus, the Tang emperor tucked the letter into his sleeve and closed his eyes, never to return. This clumsy dragon’s case was a realm of their own making, conjured in the hearts of the Tang emperor and his ministers. Its hidden signs await revelation in later chapters, but its dreamlike nature is no different from the ant in the locust tree or the deer beneath the plantain—all waking illusions.",

      "translated_text": "How then could he employ Pei Ji’s cunning schemes, sending palace women of the Sui to attend the High Ancestor? By coercing him with an inescapable situation, he ensnared his father in unrighteousness, transgressing the bounds of filial duty and offending the august will of Heaven. The silent decree of retribution found its accomplices in his ministers and aides, who enabled the plot. The High Ancestor, like clouds moving and rain bestowing, failed in restraint—just as the old dragon was misled by the eel’s strategist. For defying the timely summons and delaying the clouds and rain, fearing celestial punishment and meeting the sword of wisdom, was this not fitting?\n\nThe dragon of the Jing River was none other than Li Yuan—hence called \"old.\" The phrase *\"rain and water together measured three feet three inches and forty-eight drops\"* cryptically encodes the name \"Li Yuan.\" Combining the two characters: three horizontal strokes form three feet, three vertical strokes form three inches, and the four water radicals with the eighteen strokes of *zi* make forty-eight drops. Further, when merged and arranged, they resemble the shape of the character \"four,\" and when calculated separately, yield the number twenty-four (four times six); combined with the three water radicals and the character *ba*, they form another twenty-four (three times eight), totaling forty-eight drops. Removing the three vertical strokes subtracts three inches; removing the *ba* and *zi* from \"Li\" subtracts eight drops. The remaining strokes of \"Li\" (一) and \"Yuan\" (氵) combine to form \"Jing.\" Thus, \"Li Yuan\" is veiled as \"Jing.\" The dragon lurks in the depths, the old dwells in the turbid—Jing River was indeed his domain.\n\nYet when Taizong transformed the household into a state, he falsely claimed to rescue his father from peril while failing to avert the decree of Heaven’s justice. Concealing soldiers at Xuanwu Gate, he secretly accused his father of debauchery in the rear palace, then proclaimed his own unrecognized merits, forcing the events of the fourth day of the sixth month—seizing the throne by coercing his father and killing his brother, following the same path as Yang Guang. This was but a continuation of the Sui’s downfall. Guang perished in thirteen years, and Shimin died in thirteen years—was this not fitting?\n\nMoreover, he took the consort of Prince Chaoli and fraudulently fabricated an heir, corrupting the bonds of husband and wife, father and son, brothers and sisters—so thoroughly that even the virtuous Lady Li, who cast herself into the noose to preserve wifely integrity, or Liu Quan, who risked death to present melons and uphold the husband’s authority, were not their equal. Thus, he was right to have the soul of Princess Wang seized, reuniting her in life and death with her kin, allowing husband and wife, father and child, brother and sister to reopen the lotus stem and gather in one chamber.\n\nWhen Taizong wielded the blade, the bonds of fraternal loyalty were utterly extinguished, leaving no trace to extend to his sister. Such is the retribution of yin and yang, precise to the finest hair. Therefore, the Immortal Master, through Taizong’s own words, declared: *\"When I return to the yang world, I shall repay only with melons and fruit.\"* The \"southern melon\" (*nan gua*): *nan* (south) is *li* (fire), belonging to the heart. It signifies that as long as the heart’s ground is luminous, the fruit will be the recompense. As the *Book of Songs* says: *\"You cast me a quince, I return you a gemmed plum. Not as repayment, but to forever cherish the bond.\"* Lady Li’s noose and Liu Quan’s melon were the cast quince; Cuilian’s borrowed corpse and Yuying’s descent were the gemmed plum in return. Male and female embody the Dao of yin and yang; gift and reciprocity embody the principle of karmic retribution. To forever cherish the bond is to revive even after death. Compared to those who privately add two years of life or falsely borrow a treasury—though revived, they remain in a great dream—how vast is the difference!\n\nYet Taizong’s experience was but a dream, not true death. All the visions of hell were self-constructed within his mind. Thus, when his ministers spoke at the moment of returning to yang, they asked: *\"What does Your Majesty still find unsettling?\"* This is the true record. When the civil and military officials of the Eastern and Western Palaces all memorialized: *\"How could Your Majesty’s dream of the former court last so long before awakening?\"*—the words *\"a dream\"* were spoken with utter clarity.",

      "translated_text": "**Note:**\n\nEmperor Taizong ascended the throne at twenty-nine, changed the era name to *Zhenguan*, and lived to fifty-three. He reigned for twenty-four years in truth, not thirty-three. Now, when it is said that the thirteenth year of *Zhenguan* had two years added to it, the matter seems erroneous—yet therein lies a subtle meaning. For Gaozu Yuan reigned nine years, though in reality, it was Taizong’s scheming within the palace that coerced and usurped the throne. Thus, though *Wude* held the empty title, *Zhenguan* had already seized the divine regalia. If the nine years of *Wude* are shifted and added to the twenty-four of *Zhenguan*, does it not make thirty-three years? One and three make two and three; two and three make three and three—three threes precisely yield nine. Hence, the addition of two strokes already conveys the meaning of adding nine years, a stroke of the immortal master’s ingenuity.\n\nTaking the thirteenth year as the time of his journey through the netherworld was to foreshadow the continuation of life after death. Adding two strokes revealed the hidden power of yin usurpation, exposing the concealed disloyalty to his father. Later, when Xuanzang returned after fourteen years, he did so beyond the falsely added years, so Taizong should not have lived to see it. Thus, the thirty-three years of his reign were merely a device to conclude the narrative of his westward journey and the transmission of scriptures for the salvation of the world.\n\nLater generations, in discussing governance, extol the *Zhenguan* era of the Tang, nearly achieving a realm where punishments were laid aside. Yet the great root was already flawed, and all its branches and leaves were but falsehoods—what was there truly to admire? The immortal master used this to expound grandly, urging those who cultivate the Dao to refine their minds and selves in pursuit of the Great Way. If one resorts to deception and fraud, even the slightest unease in the heart is to forge one’s own hell. Thus, the Old Dragon, heeding the advice of his marshal, grew careless and unrestrained—yet could not escape a single sword. The Tang king, seeking Cui the Judge, could not set his heart at ease—and so had two strokes falsely added. Contrast this with Wukong, who set his heart down, stormed the halls of Fengdu, personally expunged his name from the ledger of the dead, and eradicated the ten classes of beings. Though all were dreams, their awakenings differed.\n\nIn sum, those who comprehend the Dao and set their hearts down will surely, like Wukong, clearly dissolve the records of death and ascend to heaven. Those who fail to comprehend the Dao and cannot set their hearts at ease will, like Taizong, secretly extend their lifespans—only to descend into the earth. Heaven and hell lie within the heart.

      "translated_text": "I once traveled to Daliang and visited the ancient Great Xiangguo Monastery. Its monastic halls stood towering and resplendent, with sandalwood relics spread across the fields—no less grand than the Bao Guo Monastery of Yandu. The last pavilion soared high into the azure, inscribed with the name \"Sutra Repository.\" Ascending its layered stairs was like spiraling a conch; four tiers of flying eaves encircled it, crimson railings winding in curves. Gazing downward, all below appeared as ducks and ants, clouds and trees emerging and vanishing, their forms shifting with each step—truly a wondrous sight.\n\nAt its center stood a solemn altar, flanked by eight cabinets, their locks and bolts secure, housing the sutras within. In the right corner stood statues of a man and woman: the man with thick brows and a commoner’s topknot, the woman with a purple complexion and bared chest, both beaming with joy. I inquired of the guiding monk, who explained they were the \"Water-Selling Lord and Lady.\" The tales of Taizong’s journey through the underworld, his borrowing of paper money, and his revival to rebuild the monastery aligned perfectly with *Journey to the West*. Examining the stele, I found records of the monastery’s founding, its origins unknown, flourishing in the sixth year of Tianbao during the Northern Qi, and restored under Emperor Ruizong of Tang. Though the annals detailed successive renovations in great depth, they made no mention of the deeds of Lord Xiang and his wife. Yet the couple had indeed contributed to the monastery’s merit. Their statues and the Sutra Repository endured through the ages, proving that the chronicler’s account was not entirely baseless mirages or illusions.\n\nAlas! The two elders, toiling as water-sellers, amassed their wealth with great difficulty, yet delighted in benevolence and giving, never scheming for themselves. Their station was humble, but their vision was vast. Though they may not have fully comprehended the Dao, they glimpsed one facet of the great Way. As Laozi said: *\"Putting oneself last, one finds oneself first; losing oneself, one preserves oneself.\"* Lord Xiang and his wife embodied this.

      "original_text": "第十二回　玄奘秉诚建大会　观音显像化金蝉 悟一子曰：酰鸡谓瓮大，井蛙谓天小。 非瓮果大，天果小，局于观也。 篇中复提“贞观”二字，以志建会之始，见为女子之贞观，而非大土之大观。 若太宗之治绩，贞观矣，玄奘则进； 傅奕之奏议，贞观矣，萧瑀则进：要皆贞观也。 即如太宗赐玄奘五彩织锦袈裟，以为极华丽宠渥矣。 岂知有佛赐锦襕袈裟，九环锡杖，为巍巍绚艳之至宝。 得菩萨一番赞美，而太宗前踢袈裟，未免削然无色。 如太宗命玄奘集诸僧参禅讲法，大开方便，谓之建大会矣。 “菩萨拍着宝台，厉声高叫：‘和尚！ 你只会谈小乘教法，可会谈大乘教法么？ ’”得菩萨将大乘三藏法指示，能超亡者升天，能度难人脱体，能修无量寿身，能作无去无来，而玄奘素所得力参讲之教法，已只可浑俗和光。 何也？ 观至美而美者失其美，观至大而大者失其大也。 菩萨显出救苦真身，庄严色相； 半空中落下简帖，内云“西方有妙文”，“求正裹金身”。 此西方之妙文，即金丹之正道也。 玄奘愿往两天，号称“三藏”，已包三藏之真经于一体。 合三家之五行于一号。 “三藏”二字，已是大乘。 何谓三藏？ 以经数而言：五千零四十八卷为一藏，共计一万五千一百四十四卷。 以五行而言：金水一家为一藏，木火一家为一藏，土一家为一藏。 以阴阳而言：天为一藏，地为一藏，鬼为一藏。 鬼，即二气之良能，盈天地间，皆是也。 此时已得三藏之名，而未得三藏之实，故谓之“金蝉”。 蝉者，鸣不以口，饮而不食，处卑而趋高，物中最清高之品，以喻清净无为、其性涵空之意。 金乃百炼不磨、光明融结之体，以喻性体之虚灵。 然性体虽具而命根未固，所谓“巍巍佛堂，其中无佛”也。 故玄奘得小乘之法门，止如金蝉之空壳而已。 必三家相见之后，方能充实命基，成真金不坏之体，而得见如来，此大乘教法也。 观音奉佛旨而来，已于五色锦襕袈裟、九环宝杖二物，显示其旨。 玄奘受赐，已接得佛旨，了无剩义。 袈裟，像五行之攒簇； 九环，像九转之返还，故曰显像化金蝉。 不曰度，而曰化，正如时雨之施一时，甲坼勃然生发矣。 读《西游》者，往后看去，无不以为希奇怪诞，疑惑不经。 不知下文三徒，即三家相见，为药物也； 八十一难，即九九返还，为火候也。 夫五行之情状，九转之神灵，原变幻无定，不可测度。 笔墨所到，俱是真实妙相，庸常至理，其中勇猛精进，防危虑险，及一切法度细微之旨，无不毕具。 指明“西天天竺国大雷音寺我佛如来处”一句，大是显露。 夙有仙骨者，若能熟读此书，察识奥妙，即如真人之亲授的旨，而锦襕袈裟、九环宝杖之至宝，可当身披执矣。 然玄奘必得三徒，而后能拜见如来，其义易明。 三徒己了长生之道，命根坚固，自是万劫不坏，何以反以玄奘为师？ 甚说难晓。 盖仙佛同道：佛曰“丈六金身”，仙曰“修成二人”，俱是有为而至于无为。 了命不了性，如宝镜不磨而无光，非有为之真空； 了性不了命，如筑室无基而安柱，是无为之空寂。 故有为者，必见性明心，而始能超脱五行，三徒之皈依扳佛法是也。 无为者，必攒簇五行，而后能超凡入圣，玄奘之收伏三徒是也。",
      "translated_text": "**Chapter Twelve: Xuanzang Holds Sincere Convocation—Guanyin Manifests to Transform the Golden Cicada**\n\nWu Yizi remarked: *\"The vinegar fly calls the jar vast; the well-frog calls the sky small.\"* Yet the jar is not truly vast, nor the sky truly small—it is but the limitation of their view.\n\nThis chapter once more invokes the term *\"Zhenguan\"* to mark the inception of the convocation, revealing it as the *\"Zhenguan\"* of a woman, not the grand vision of a great sovereign. The governance of Taizong was *\"Zhenguan\"* indeed, yet Xuanzang surpassed it; the memorials of Fu Yi were *\"Zhenguan\"* as well, yet Xiao Yu surpassed them—both were, in essence, *\"Zhenguan.\"* When Taizong bestowed upon Xuanzang a five-colored brocade kasaya, it was deemed the height of splendor and imperial favor. Little did he know of the Buddha’s gift of a brocade kasaya and a nine-ringed tin staff, the most resplendent and dazzling of treasures. After the Bodhisattva’s praise, Taizong’s offering paled into insignificance. When Taizong commanded Xuanzang to gather monks for meditation and sutra lectures, opening wide the gates of expedient means, it was called a grand convocation. Yet the Bodhisattva, striking the jeweled platform, cried aloud: *\"Monk! You speak only of the Lesser Vehicle—can you expound the Great Vehicle?\"* Once the Bodhisattva revealed the Mahāyāna Tripiṭaka, it could elevate the deceased to heaven, deliver the afflicted from suffering, cultivate a body of boundless life, and attain the state of neither coming nor going. Xuanzang’s usual teachings, by comparison, could only harmonize with the mundane. Why? For beholding the supremely beautiful, the merely beautiful loses its luster; gazing upon the boundlessly great, the merely great diminishes.\n\nThe Bodhisattva manifested her true form of salvation, adorned in majestic splendor. From midair descended a scroll, inscribed: *\"In the West lies wondrous scripture,\"* and *\"Seek the true golden body.\"* This wondrous scripture of the West is the true Dao of the Golden Elixir. Xuanzang, vowing to journey to the two heavens, was styled *\"Tripiṭaka,\"* for he embodied the true scriptures of the Three Baskets in one. The name united the Five Phases of the three traditions.\n\nWhat is *\"Tripiṭaka\"*? In terms of scripture count: 5,048 scrolls form one *piṭaka*, totaling 15,144 scrolls. In terms of the Five Phases: Metal and Water form one *piṭaka*, Wood and Fire another, and Earth the third. In terms of yin and yang: Heaven is one *piṭaka*, Earth another, and Ghosts the third. Ghosts are the innate efficacy of the two qi, pervading all between heaven and earth. At this point, Xuanzang bore the name of the Three Baskets but not yet their reality—hence, he was called the *\"Golden Cicada.\"* The cicada does not sing with its mouth, drinks but does not eat, dwells in lowliness yet ascends to heights, the most refined of creatures, symbolizing purity, non-action, and a nature that embraces emptiness. Gold is a body tempered through a hundred refinings, radiant and indestructible, symbolizing the luminous emptiness of the nature. Yet though the nature is complete, the root of life remains unsecured—this is the *\"towering Buddhist hall with no Buddha within.\"* Thus, Xuanzang’s grasp of the Lesser Vehicle was but the hollow shell of a golden cicada. Only after the meeting of the three traditions could the foundation of life be fulfilled, forging a body of true, indestructible gold and beholding the Tathāgata—this is the teaching of the Great Vehicle.\n\nGuanyin, sent by the Buddha’s decree, revealed her intent through the five-colored brocade kasaya and the nine-ringed precious staff. Xuanzang, in receiving these, had grasped the Buddha’s decree without remainder. The kasaya symbolized the gathering of the Five Phases; the nine rings, the ninefold return of cyclical refinement—hence, *\"manifesting to transform the golden cicada.\"* Not *\"deliverance,\"* but *\"transformation,\"* like timely rain that causes seeds to sprout and burst forth.\n\nReaders of *Journey to the West* may find what follows strange and fantastical, doubting its authenticity. Yet the three disciples to come are the meeting of the three traditions, the medicinal ingredients; the eighty-one trials are the ninety-ninefold return, the firing process. The dispositions of the Five Phases and the numinous power of the nine transformations are inherently mutable and unfathomable. Wherever the brush touches, it reveals true and wondrous forms, the most profound and ordinary principles. Within lie courageous progress, vigilance against peril, and every subtle precept of the Dharma, all fully present. The line *\"the Great Thunderclap Monastery of the Western Heaven, the realm of Tathāgata, our Buddha\"* is a most revealing declaration. Those with innate immortal bones, if they study this book deeply and discern its mysteries, will receive its teachings as if from a true master, and the treasures of the brocade kasaya and nine-ringed staff may be worn and wielded in this very life.\n\nYet Xuanzang must first obtain his three disciples before he can pay homage to the Tathāgata—this is easily understood. The three disciples had already attained the Dao of longevity, their life-roots firm and indestructible through ten thousand kalpas. Why, then, did they take Xuanzang as their master? This is difficult to fathom. The reason lies in the shared path of immortals and Buddhas: the Buddha speaks of the *\"seven-foot golden body,\"* while immortals speak of *\"cultivating two persons\"*—both are the progression from action to non-action. To perfect life without perfecting nature is like a precious mirror left unpolished, lacking radiance—this is not the true emptiness of action. To perfect nature without perfecting life is like building a house without a foundation, erecting pillars in vain—this is the barren emptiness of non-action. Thus, those who act must first see nature and illuminate the mind before transcending the Five Phases—this is why the three disciples took refuge in the Buddha’s Dharma. Those who do not act must gather the Five Phases before transcending the mundane and entering sagehood—this is why Xuanzang subdued the three disciples.",

Contrast them with those who hoard wealth and cling to stinginess, perishing in an instant—some even leaving descendants as beggars. What, then, was the purpose of their lives? How lamentable!",

Xuanzang had not fully realized the subtlety of action, yet the three disciples embodied it—thus he taught them as his disciples. When master and disciples unite as one, this is the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir, the supreme and most authentic Mahayana Dharma. Only after ascending the bottomless boat and shedding the husk do they achieve the mutual aid of master and disciples, where neither owes gratitude to the other—this is the original intent.\n\nThe Patriarch said: *\"Human life is like a bubble, an illusion. Without this bubble, this illusion, the great matter cannot be accomplished; but once the great matter is accomplished, what use is this bubble, this illusion?\"* Ascending the bottomless boat and shedding the husk is precisely when the great matter is accomplished—it is the golden cicada shedding its shell and transforming.\n\nThroughout the book, the master is styled as a \"Buddha-child\" and named *\"Xuan\"* (Mystery); the disciples are all \"immortal-children\" and named *\"Wu\"* (Awakening). Without awakening, there is no thorough mystery; without mystery, there is no thorough awakening. Immortals are Buddhas, Buddhas are immortals—there is no dual Dao, no dual function.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: Falling into the Tiger’s Den, the Metal Star Resolves the Crisis; At Twin-Fork Ridge, Boqin Shelters the Monk**\n\nWu Yizi said: Shun declared, *\"The human heart is perilous.\"* Zhuangzi said, *\"What is so impetuous and unbridled that it cannot be restrained? Is it not the human heart?\"* Perilous, impetuous, and unbridled—these deeply reveal the treacherous nature of the human heart. The *\"Five Sons’ Song\"* in the *Book of Documents* says, *\"Like driving six horses with rotten reins\"*—the six horses are a metaphor for the human heart.\n\nYet controlling horses depends on reins and bridles, while controlling the heart depends on reverence. Reverence is how the sage begins and completes the Way. Thus, in cultivating the Dao and learning the Way, the very first step upon setting out is to fully restrain the perilous nature of the human heart, lest one fall into its traps.\n\nThis chapter marks Tripitaka’s first step on his western journey. The assembled monks debated the purpose, each describing the hardships ahead. Tripitaka said: *\"When the heart arises, all manner of demons arise; when the heart is extinguished, all manner of demons are extinguished.\"* Some say these two lines succinctly capture the entire essence, leaving nothing more to be said.\n\nAlas! To mistake the human heart for the Dao-mind is to mistake the heart for the Dao, to take the false as real—this is a grave error! One must recognize that all within this heart is demonic and must be severed and eradicated at the root. Only through unyielding strength and resolute decisiveness can this be achieved. If extinguishing the heart were the full extent of the purpose, why then journey to the West to obtain the Mahayana true sutras?\n\nThis is the blindness of the fleshly eye, failing to recognize the true form of the living Buddha—the wondrous seven-foot golden body. It is like setting out and reaching the border of mountains and rivers, only to take the wrong path and suddenly lose one’s footing, tumbling into a pit.\n\nThe chapter vividly illustrates this, for the phrases *\"heart arises\"* and *\"demons arise\"* merely point out the perilous nature of the human heart, teaching one to strike first—this is the starting point. Tripitaka mistook these two as the very trap, and his heart’s panic was the tiger’s appearance.\n\nThe human heart is like a tiger: the tiger’s trap and the heart’s trap ensnare a person in the same way. What difference is there between falling into the heart’s den and the tiger’s den? How can this be seen?\n\nThe concluding verse says: *\"The white-browed king of South Mountain.\"* South is *li* (☲), corresponding to *bing* (丙), and the *bing* fire’s phase of growth begins in *yin* (寅)—the *yin* general. This clearly designates the *yin* general as the heart. Yet fearing that the world might not understand, the text introduces the two demons, the bear and the yaksha, as proof. The bear belongs to fire, born within *yin*; the yaksha belongs to earth, born within *bing*.\n\nThe demon king said: *\"They delivered themselves to my door.\"* This entirely depicts the peril of the human heart ensnaring itself.",

Thus the Mountain Lord said: *\"Devour the two, but spare the one—this may be done.\"* The Golden Star below signifies the original nature of the One.

The way to preserve life rests solely upon the true One’s gold. *\"Suddenly, an old man appeared, staff in hand\"*—this is the original nature’s mastery, by which life may be preserved. Thus he thanked the old man for saving his life. The old man then asked: *\"Have you lost anything?\"* Tripitaka replied: *\"Two attendants were devoured, and I know not where my luggage and horse have gone.\"* The old man pointed and said: *\"Are not that a horse and two bundles?\"* Tripitaka turned to look, and indeed, they were his belongings—only then did his heart settle. Though these seem idle words, they carry essential meaning. For the *\"two attendants\"* are the ordinary heart, fallen into the trap and devoured; Tripitaka, having beheld the master, retains only the Dao-heart.

      "translated_text": "Threefold Basket, having encountered tigers and serpents, myriad demonic toxins—though knowing they arose from his own heart—found no means of deliverance. Alone and without recourse, he could only relinquish body and mind, surrendering to heaven’s decree. This was the moment when his original nature, fundamentally luminous, extinguished the human heart and temporarily preserved the celestial heart.\n\nYet this place was the crossroads where heavenly and mortal realms diverged, leaving him stranded amid towering ridges, neither able to advance nor retreat. The meaning of *\"Twin-Fork\"* echoed Mozi’s lament at the forked path, where one might turn southeast or northwest—where the White-Forehead King and Liu the Stalwart clashed in battle. Man and beast, vividly depicted, revealed the threshold between humanity and ferocity: only rectitude could dispel evil, only principle could overcome desire. If one could master reverence and self-restraint, cultivate courage and unyielding strength, then the heart’s demons would vanish, and one might feast on flesh and sleep upon hides.\n\n*\"Liu\"* signified the power to overcome the Yin and halt the slaughter; *\"Tai\"* (Stalwart) denoted the capacity to contend for leadership and uphold household governance; *\"Qin\"* (Reverent) meant inner humility and outward dignity, mastering reverence to sustain the self. *\"Wielding a rigid fork\"* symbolized inflexible strength, while *\"styled ‘Guardian of the Mountain’\"* signified unshakable composure—reverence resided not beyond the heart but within it, as a fellow villager. The practice of reverence began within filial piety, thus making him a filial son. Only through reverence could he dwell unharmed in the tiger’s den; only through filial devotion could he guard the desolate mountain without peril. Tigers and wolves became his daily fare, for strength sufficed to quell desire; reciting sutras fulfilled his filial duty of deliverance, for sincerity could reach even the unseen. The single word *\"reverence\"* was the bridge spanning safety and danger, ease and hardship.\n\nYet he remained bound to the tigers and wolves, unable to transcend the snares of the world; he could only guard this mountain, not venture beyond its borders. Arriving at Two-Boundary Mountain, he escaped fear and obstruction, for here lay the parting of heavenly and mortal paths—he could not press forward as one. This was called *\"able to detain the monk but unable to escort him.\"*\n\nAlas! The mountain lord devoured monks yet detained them, consuming two; the mountain guardian devoured tigers yet detained the monk, preserving one. Yet it was not the tiger that consumed him, but the monk who consumed himself; not Qin who detained him, but the monk who detained himself. As for Twin-Fork Ridge and Two-Boundary Mountain, one must discern: *\"Twin-Fork\"* as the path where man and beast contend, *\"Two-Boundary\"* as the way where nature and destiny advance or halt—these distinctions could not be ignored.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: The Mind-Ape Returns to Rectitude, the Six Bandits Vanish Without Trace**\n*Wu Yizi says:* The human heart is like weeds, the Dao-heart like fine grain. If one eradicates all mundane thoughts yet lacks sagely understanding, it is like clearing a field of chaff and barnyard grass—leaving it utterly barren. How then can one repay the debt of hunger? As the Patriarch said: *\"If the cauldron lacks the true seed, one merely boils an empty pot with water and fire.\"*\n\nThe *\"mind\"* in *\"mind-ape\"* refers to the Dao-heart. The Dao-heart is not the spirit of deliberation within the heart, but the spirit of essence and oneness within the Five Phases. Only by attaining this heart does one possess the true seed, which is why the Lord of Yu specially emphasized the Dao-heart’s subtlety, refinement, and singularity, faithfully holding to the mean’s mystery.\n\nReaders who mistake the human heart for the mind-ape, failing to recognize the Handsome Monkey King as the true seed of essence and oneness, are like those who take a parasitic wasp’s larva for their own child.

      "translated_text": "Should one cultivate reverence and refine the heart with utmost devotion, even with the great power of Bo Qin, one may only escape the jaws of the tiger—how could one transcend beyond the boundaries of the realms? Yet this matter is difficult to comprehend, hence the verse twice employs the character \"know\" to instruct: only by truly knowing can one truly practice.\n\nAs when Bo Qin, standing at the Mountain of Two Realms, saw the monkey pleading for rescue and asked, *\"How can I discern truth from falsehood?\"* The monkey replied, *\"It is true! I dare not deceive!\"*—echoing the Tathāgata’s vow: *\"I now pledge to ensure this matter for you, its fulfillment certain.\"* At the summit, six characters are boldly proclaimed, and the Monkey Spirit indeed emerges from the cave, bearing a profound principle beyond brush or ink. Only by knowing that the human heart must be extinguished and the Dao-heart must be born—extinguishing the human heart and birthing the Dao-heart—does the cultivation of the Way begin. Thus, rescuing the \"heart-monkey\" and renaming it *\"Pilgrim\"* marks the true knowing and the commencement of practice.\n\nThe first step in practice lies in subduing the tiger. *\"Beyond the Mountain of Two Realms, a fierce tiger suddenly appeared.\"* This tiger is not the tiger that ensnares the heart within, but the tiger that sustains the body without—hence the words, *\"Bring me clothes to wear.\"* At the sight of the Pilgrim, it prostrates in the dust, unmoving. The tiger’s nature is no longer wild, no different from the heart-monkey’s return to rectitude. Taking a garment becomes as one with the whole. The Pilgrim’s subduing of the tiger is the Tripitaka’s taming of the monkey—its significance is subtle indeed.\n\nWhen the Venerable Sun boasts of his *\"skills in subduing dragons and tigers,\"* he foreshadows the subduing of the dragon as the second step. The verse contains the line: *\"A hook of new moon pierces the dusk,\"* a phrase of exquisite beauty.

      "translated_text": "The Tang Monk and the elder trace their shared lineage, seeing self and other as one family. Master and disciples bathe, shedding grime in an instant to renew themselves; seeking needle and thread, they mend their faults even amid haste. All these depict the conduct of one returned to rectitude, yet hold no profound meaning.\n\nBut when suddenly six men burst from the roadside, roaring, *\"Leave your baggage—or we’ll spare not your life!\"*—here, the words *\"life\"* and *\"spare\"* carry a subtle truth. Earlier, at Twin-Fork Ridge, before the heart-monkey was subdued, one’s nature remained fundamentally luminous, yet life lacked a true master. Thus, one could only relinquish body and mind, entrusting them to Heaven’s decree. That life came from Heaven. Now, with the heart-monkey tamed, life bears a true seed—hence both *nature* and *life* are spoken of together. *\"Spare you and let you pass\"* means this life now depends on oneself. Though one may fall from the horse, the heart can rest easy in its affairs.\n\nThe heart is fundamentally empty, yet in truth, all things are complete within it. If the eye fixates on private gain, if thoughts arise from the bodily husk, this becomes a *private hoard*. But when one embodies the great and the public, gathering all beings into oneself, this becomes the *public treasury*. To neglect the public treasury while enriching the private hoard is to betray the lord and join the bandits—just as they say, *\"You have nothing at all, yet you come back demanding things from us!\"*\n\nThus, when the lord’s virtue is clear and bright, the six offices are harmonious; when the heart’s sovereign is at peace, the six officials fulfill their duties. The eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind—these are Heaven’s thieves. Men cannot see them, and the heart, lacking a master, is swayed: the eye sees and delights, the ear hears and rages, the nose smells and clings, the tongue tastes and craves, the mind conceives and desires, the body brims with cares. Thus, the bandits run rampant, plundering wantonly, and *nature* and *life* follow in their wake.\n\nAs the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: *\"The six entrances: the eye enters form, the ear enters sound, the nose enters scent, the tongue enters flavor, the body enters touch, the mind enters phenomena.\"* These six thieves are worldly bandits—all invited in when the master carelessly opens the door.\n\nWukong recognizes himself as the true master. *\"Standing firm in the center\"* means neither leaning nor drifting; *\"feigning ignorance\"* means unyielding strength. Wielding the weapon of wisdom, he extinguishes them all, strips them of their spoils, and repurposes them as clothing and provisions—this is using stillness to quell chaos, truth to vanquish falsehood. Unlike the human heart, which is disturbed by both mind and things, this is truly the thunderbolt’s might. If, in the moment, he had shown the slightest hesitation or mercy, it would have been like inviting thieves in—none escape unharmed. Hence he says, *\"If I don’t kill them, they’ll kill you.\"* This is the thunderous shout of one who has experienced body and mind!\n\nThe Tang Monk, unaware of the bandits’ malice, remains ever compassionate, unable to act decisively—this is what it means to *\"be unfit for monkhood, unworthy of the Western Heaven.\"* Thus, through Wukong’s words and deeds, the text portrays the endless harm wrought by a heart without a master.\n\nThe Tang Monk, his heart lacking resolve, yet claims *\"I’ll decide for myself\"*—this is throwing away his life in vain. He has already spoken his own doom; how can he fulfill his destiny? All stems from his inability to quietly observe and discern the unchanging unity of essence—hence Guanyin transforms into an old woman, bearing robes and hat, transmitting the spell, and pointing the way through delusion.\n\nThe old woman says, *\"These were originally my son’s.\"* And again, *\"My home is to the east; he must have gone there.\"*",

      "translated_text": "She then says, *\"I’ll call him back to follow you.\"*\n\nNow, Wukong embodies the Dao-heart—he is the Metal Duke. The *Yi* speaks of what is easily let loose yet hard to subdue, easily lost yet hard to find. But since he was originally of my household, merely lodged in the West for a time, his return to the East already shows intent to return. One must recognize the call to *\"summon him back!\"* Thus, the *Awakening to Reality* says:\n\n*\"The Metal Duke was originally the Eastern House’s son,\nSent to the Western neighbor to lodge and take form.\"*\n\nRecognizing the *\"summons,\"* he returns to his dwelling to nurture and unite, taking the Maiden as kin—here, the old woman’s guidance is most clear.\n\nThe *\"gold-embedded flowered cap\"* is the Golden Tight Restraint, as previously explained. Now, an embroidered robe is added, along with the *\"True Spell of Settling the Heart\"*—this depicts the character *\"怀\"* (to cherish). The robe bears the cap; Metal belongs to the Western Four. To establish the heart and don them—is this not *\"怀\"*? The meaning of *\"怀\"* inherently contains the sense of departure, yet returning is already implied. Just as *\"cherishing the feudal lords\"* makes the realm stand in awe, or *\"cherishing the law\"* keeps it ever in mind, the Dao-heart naturally abides. Thus she says: *\"If he refuses to obey you, recite this spell—he will never dare leave again.\"* This is the one-word true spell, a truly wondrous formula.\n\nThe Dragon King urges Wukong to return to the Sangha, recounting the tale of Huang Shigong—showing that only with an empty heart can one attain the true fruit. The Bodhisattva teaches Wukong to turn back, entering the gate of tight restraint—showing that a single thought can take root. With no regret, one may press forward, and the Great Dao lies within sight.\n\nYet the Heart-Ape’s return to rectitude is a mutual awakening, not Wukong’s alone. For Wukong, it is the Heart-Ape of action, returning to rectitude by entering Xuanzang’s Buddhist gate. For Xuanzang, it is the Heart-Ape of non-action, returning to rectitude by gaining Wukong’s active Dao-heart.\n\nThe *\"Six Bandits\"* are everywhere beneficial, fully attesting to the Dao-heart. For Xuanzang, they nearly bring calamity—serving as whetstones for tempering. For Wukong, a single staff strike slays them—like gathering provisions for the Dao-path. It is said: *\"The Trackless One\"*—*\"踪\"* (track) lies within *\"no return,\"* while *\"无\"* (none) lies within *\"return to rectitude.\"* When one returns, all returns; when one is rectified, all is rectified. The Heart-Ape is truly the seed of reality.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: Serpents Coil at the Mountain, Gods Secretly Protect;\nThe Eagle’s Sorrow Gorge, the Mind-Horse’s Reins Are Gathered**\n\nWu Yizi says: The Tai Bai Immortal’s song declares:\n*\"Dragons emerge from whore-fire,\nTigers are born in water.\"*\n\nRegarding the Kan and Li of the body: it is clear that within yin there is yang, and within yang there is yin—the principle of yin-yang inversion. The heart is Li, yang, the dragon; the yin within Li is the tiger. The kidneys are Kan, yin, the tiger; the yang within Kan is the dragon. Only by subduing the tiger can the true water within Li descend and follow the dragon. Only by taming the dragon can the true fire within Kan rise and approach the tiger. This is called the *\"water and fire intermingling, Kan and Li coupling\"*—the first essential step in internal alchemy.\n\nThe previous chapter’s work of subduing the tiger was accomplished in the mountains; this chapter’s task of taming the dragon must be sought in the waters. *\"Snake-Coiling Mountain\"* depicts the body’s internal entanglements; *\"Eagle’s Sorrow Gorge\"* symbolizes the perilous ford where one is easily drowned.\n\nThe *\"fiendish dragon suddenly emerges to swallow the horse, then vanishes without a trace\"*—showing its elusive leaps and untamed ferocity. *\"Old Sun cannot bear his impatience, scolds the master for being a pushover\"*—showing that restraint has its methods, while fear and hesitation are of no use.\n\n*\"By Guanyin’s decree, the Metal Spirit secretly aids\"*—clarifying that quiet observation and discernment reveal the priority of preservation. *\"Lifting the tiger’s pelt, calling the loach to return the horse\"*—demands vigilant self-mastery, ensuring governance is never lax.\n\nThe *\"two locked in combat\"* resemble the meeting of the Zi and Wu hours. *\"Sanzang says: ‘The other day, when you struck the tiger, you claimed to have the skill to tame dragons and subdue tigers—why can’t you subdue this one today?’\"* Here, the taming of the dragon is explicitly raised, tightly paired with the previous chapter’s subduing of the tiger.\n\n*\"The Traveler arrives at the gorge, churning the waters like the Nine Bends of the Yellow River in flood.\"* The fiendish dragon, deep in the gorge, sits and lies in unrest. To subdue and still it, one must first rouse and stir it—this is the Daoist formula: *\"Flanks bent, waist curved, the Yellow River flows backward.\"* This is the method of striking and circulating, the key to taming the dragon. Otherwise, if left to its leaps and bounds, the dragon emerges from water, refusing to turn with the mind and heed our command—how then can it aid our Dao?\n\nOnly through ceaseless diligence, constant movement and stillness, can the true dragon be tamed. If it burrows into the grass, leaving no trace, it means the heels have rested, and progress halts. Thus, one must earnestly investigate, seeking its tracks and whereabouts, never allowing it to follow its own path and destroy the true mechanism. This is why the Monkey King, in his urgency, recites the spell, and the Earth Spirit reveals the dangers of the gorge.\n\n*\"Crows and sparrows dare not fly over, for the water is so clear they see their own reflections, mistaking them for their kin and often plunging in to drown.\"* This illustrates that those who do not recognize the true dragon in the water and seek to subdue it instead mistake the water for harmless and drown—just as crows and sparrows, ignorant, take their reflections for companions and plunge to their deaths.\n\nHeaven has set this sheer gorge, where even wings cannot cross—yet within lies the Black Pearl, urgently awaiting exploration. How then to begin?",

      "translated_text": "Direct the intent, tightly grasp the dragon’s horns, and bear the weight for distant conveyance. Swallow the white horse, and intent transforms into dragon; transform the white horse, and the dragon dissolves into intent. Follow intent in transformation, and the dragon’s nature becomes docile, obeying the heart’s every desire. Thus, upon seeing the *Bimawen*, control and release come effortlessly.\n\nYet to subdue the tiger, one must first subdue the ordinary tiger before the true tiger appears. The true tiger has no form—it takes the ape as its form. As when, in the previous episode, the tiger was slain and its skin flayed for clothing. To subdue the dragon, one must first subdue the dragon-like before the true dragon emerges. The true dragon has no appearance—it takes the horse as its appearance. As in this episode, when the horse was swallowed and its hide transformed into scales.\n\nThese dragon and tiger reside within the self—it is merely the foundation of inner cultivation. Should one seek to harmonize with the external Five Phases to achieve the Great Dao, then the *shen*-monkey must become the tiger, and the *hai*-pig must become the dragon. One must not cling to the text or fixate on images, mistaking false dragons and tigers and thus blundering blindly in practice.\n\nWhy then could the *Xingzhe* not subdue the dragon himself and had to enlist the *Jiedi* to summon the Bodhisattva? For the dragon is a creature of unyielding strength, and only the soft Way can approach it. The slightest impatience or coercion only rouses its nature further—only Guanyin’s effortless mastery can tame it. Just as before, when the tiger was subdued, it was through the effortless power of the floral crown that bound it. Thus, the moment the *Xingzhe* saw the Bodhisattva, he invoked the method of the floral crown to restrain his own demonic impulses. Even the sinful dragon labeled the *Xingzhe* a demon, yet neither could escape the bounds of effortless mastery.\n\nSubduing the unruly arises from effortlessness, yet journeying toward the Spirit Mountain demands action. The Bodhisattva declared, *\"Only when you obtain this dragon-horse can you proceed.\"* From this point forward, true vigorous progress begins. She summoned the young dragon and said, *\"When have I ever uttered even half the word ‘Tang’ to you?\"* How profound the intent! To remain ignorant of the origins of the scripture quest is to reach a dead end at this juncture. But to grasp its true purpose is to cross this shore and enter boundless prospects.\n\nThe Bodhisattva continued, *\"That monkey-headed fool relies solely on his own strength and refuses to praise others.\"* Some say this means he cannot empty himself, making it a demonic obstacle on the path of cultivation. Others claim the *Xingzhe* trusts only his own hasty courage and scorns the wisdom of others’ effortlessness. Neither is correct. This passage reveals the immortal master’s secret essentials of the Great Dao—a subtle method of transmitting the golden needle.\n\nThe *Daoist Canon*’s ten thousand scrolls speak only of the Mysterious Pass and the Female Gate. Laozi said, *\"The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth.\"* It clarifies the mechanism of yin and yang’s ebb and flow, their union and continuity, the root’s ingress and egress—what else could be the root of heaven and earth? Those who identify the Mysterious Female with mouth and nose, heart and kidneys, are mired in form and cannot speak of *\"as if preserved.\"*\n\nDong Sijing said, *\"Spirit is the convergence of qi.\"* Cao Daochong said, *\"The Mysterious conceals spirit in profound obscurity; the Female harbors qi in harmonious emptiness.\"* Yu Yuwu stated, *\"The two cavities of Kan and Li wondrously unite the two earths, blending spirit and qi without falling into names or appearances.\"* This comes closest to the truth.",
      "overlap_context": "clear they see their own reflections, mistaking them for their kin and often plunging in to drown.\"* This illustrates that those who do not recognize the true dragon in the water and seek to subdue it instead mistake the water for harmless and drown—just as crows and sparrows, ignorant, take their reflections for companions and plunge to their deaths.\n\nHeaven has set this sheer gorge, where even wings cannot cross—yet within lies the Black Pearl, urgently awaiting exploration. How then to begin?",

      "translated_text": "Here the passage artfully presses forward to the marvel of the \"three families meeting and proceeding together.\" Every line of the Bodhisattva’s exhortation is spoken in plain truth, without parable. *\"Again, she bestowed a fundamental skill—plucking a willow leaf to transform into three life-saving hairs.\"* How profoundly subtle! The first three pertain to realizing nature, the inner lines of Qian; the latter three pertain to realizing destiny, the outer image of Qian. The first three and the latter three are ultimately the same, until all six lines become pure Qian, forging indestructible true gold—only then is the task complete. Yet the Pilgrim, taking the latter three as nature, truly embodies unfathomable transformation and boundless cyclicality. This is the very essence of great compassion and mercy, the fundamental intent of delivering the world and relieving suffering.\n\nWhen the Pilgrim and Tang Monk reached the stream’s edge, they saw an old fisherman poling a raft to ferry travelers across. This raft, though substantial, carries the mortal monk to transcend the mundane and realize nature; later, the Cloud-Soaring Ferry, steered by the Guiding Buddha, is the bottomless vessel that ferries the sage monk to realize destiny as a Great Sage. Thus it is said: *\"The vast true Suchness ascends the other shore; with sincere heart, nature is realized upon Vulture Peak.\"* This is the other shore of realizing nature, not the far bank of realizing destiny.\n\nUpon arriving at the village gate to seek lodging, they received a saddle from the Dharma-protecting horse and a whip made of tiger sinew. What he rides is a dragon; what he wields is a tiger—just as they set forth on the path. Hence the words: *\"The Bodhisattva bestowed saddle and bridle upon you. Strive diligently on the western journey; take care not to slacken or err.\"* Some say this signifies the mind-monkey returning to rectitude and the will-horse reined in, resolving seven or eight parts of the matter. Yet this merely glimpses the obstacles of mind and intent, without tracing the inner sanctum of nature and destiny! Such is the *\"fleshly eyes and mortal frame, bowing in gratitude yet failing to comprehend—how many past achievements were squandered, provoking the Great Sage’s uproarious laughter!\"* These half-hidden, half-revealed turns are most deceptive, hence the remark: *\"He truly deserved a thrashing.\"*\n\nNow, the meaning is clearly expounded: from the tangled heap, the treasure is plucked—pray, let all gather it, and spare yourselves the clout of old Sun’s golden cudgel.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: The Monks of Guanyin Monastery Scheme for the Treasure; The Monster of Black Wind Mountain Steals the Cassock**\n\nWu Yizi says: The Great Dao is profoundly subtle, its wonder lying in quiet observation and close scrutiny. With a pair of wisdom-eyes, one perceives that a thousand threads and ten thousand strands are but one affair—lest illusory shadows and empty flowers obscure the true essence and real meaning. These three chapters all prepare for the nineteenth, where Tian Peng is subdued, embodying the essentials of cultivating truth. Fearing that the world would not recognize this, the immortal master raises the banner of *\"observation,\"* threading it through the three chapters from beginning to end. One must observe both inception and conclusion; this must not be overlooked.\n\nIn this chapter, the folly of solitary cultivation of a single thing is made clear, and the perils of cunning and treachery leading to self-destruction must be known. The brocade cassock, a treasure of the heavens, is the color and form of the golden elixir. Only through accumulating virtue and amassing benevolence, radiating brightness and uprightness, honoring teachers and esteeming friends, and guiding through silent enlightenment may one hope for its reward. If one resorts to scheming and deceit, thinking only of oneself and not others, flaunting strength and cunning, and habitually straying into side paths—such are the ranks of wolfish schemers and rat-like thieves. They seek not longevity but hasten their own demise!\n\nThus, the root of cultivating truth most abhors a scheming mind. Of old, Master Duanmu encountered an old man by the Han River, who embraced a jar to irrigate his garden. Pitying his labor, Duanmu taught him to use a well-sweep. The old man said: *\"I have heard that those who employ machinery must engage in mechanical affairs, and those who engage in mechanical affairs must harbor a mechanical mind. When a mechanical mind resides in the breast, purity and whiteness are no longer whole; when purity and whiteness are incomplete, the spirit is unsettled; when the spirit is unsettled, the Dao cannot bear it. I am not ignorant of this—I am ashamed to do it.\"* Duanmu hung his head in shame. The old man continued: *\"You are about to forget your spirit and qi, cast off your bodily form, and only then may you approach it! If you cannot govern your own person, how can you govern the world? Begone, and do not hinder my work!\"* For he detested excessive scheming.",

      "translated_text": "The monk struck the bell and laughed, saying, *\"You wouldn’t understand—this is ‘as long as I’m a monk for a day, I’ll strike the bell for a day.’\"* He added, *\"It was your grandfather Sun who taught me to strike it for fun.\"* This is what it means to follow conditions and accept one’s lot, to harbor no scheming mind, to play along with the occasion, and to embody the uncontrived delight of Heaven—true joy in forgetting all calculation. This stands in stark contrast to the old monk below, who stirred wicked intentions, with Broad Wisdom and Broad Scheming endlessly weighing gains and losses, each deploying their cunning.\n\nThe Dao is not beyond planning, yet there is oneself and others—when self and others are united as one, what one seeks is upright. Seeking uprightness is called *vital impulse*; where vital impulse abides, life endures. But if the old monk sought personal gain at others’ expense, he walked the path of perversion. Walking perversion is called *deadly impulse*; where deadly impulse reigns, destruction follows.\n\nThe Dao is not beyond stealing, yet to rob Heaven and Earth, to pilfer the workings of Creation without harm to either side or injury to the whole—this is called *knowing the mechanism*. Knowing the mechanism is *Heaven’s mechanism*; Heaven’s mechanism is spirit. But when the black bear seized the opportunity to stealthily carry things away, this was called *riding the mechanism*. Riding the mechanism is *human mechanism*; human mechanism is demonic. The absence of mechanism appears in spontaneity; human mechanism arises from contrivance.\n\nLike the old monk who, once the cassock was in hand, wept bitterly by lamplight—Broad Wisdom and Broad Scheming’s schemes, fire attacks, and lethal force—this was human mechanism, riding the mechanism, walking perversion, and self-destruction. Yet with a numinous mind at work and seated awareness, hearing the crackle of firewood, he knew harm was afoot. Turning the tables, he ascended to the Southern Heavenly Lad to borrow the fire-repelling cloak, shielding Tang Monk while ignoring the rest. Where fire aids wind, this thing comes from illumination, harmonious yet not initiating—this was knowing the mechanism, Heaven’s mechanism, seeking uprightness to dispel perversion.\n\nIn this chapter, the two appearances of *\"a honeybee\"* devise a method, teaching one to observe closely and quietly, to recognize the error of harming others for personal gain, and the Dao’s counterstrike—how the Metal Duke cannot lack the Wood Mother. Tang Monk’s words, *\"Do not compete in wealth with others,\"* are the deep concealment of a wise merchant. The crowd’s words, *\"You only harm yourself,\"* are the self-invited consequences of fortune and misfortune. Though the admonitions are many, none hit the mark. Only by reading this closely can one grasp the art of narrative.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: Sun the Pilgrim Raises Havoc on Black Wind Mountain; Guanyin Subdues the Bear Spirit**\n\n*Wu Yizi says:* The *Cantong Qi* states, *\"Right and wrong pass through the viscera; inner observation yields reflection.\"* It speaks of the treasure of true yin and true yang, which cannot be obtained merely by scrutinizing the five viscera or scheming in thought. The old monk of the previous chapter, dwelling in Guanyin Monastery, schemed to seize the cassock—this was like inwardly observing the heart and employing the mind to plot. Little did he know that scheming with the mind stokes the heart-fire to a blaze, burning the heart-fire itself. Inevitably, it becomes a vast fire pit; not only does water fail to quell the flames, but the true treasure sinks into the lower field, just as the black bear stole away the cassock. This is the harm of misusing the mind’s mechanism. Thus, the opening laments: *\"Cursed be that old skinflint who knew not men, scheming with his heart—today he has only harmed himself.\"* This is a sobering revelation.\n\nYet to abandon the method of observing the mind and forcefully direct effort toward the kidneys is to cling to the superficial talk of refining cinnabar and mercury—a mere side door, an external path! This black fellow is none other than the demon of the lower field. The Daoist is his qi, hence named *\"Soaring Void\"*; the scholar is his essence, hence clad in white. Calling it the *\"Buddhist Robe Assembly\"* shows they recognize only the name’s surface, not its inner reality. *\"Black Wind Mountain, Black Wind Cave\"* depicts the color of the Water Palace’s qi; *\"iron helmet, black armor, dark robe, black boots\"* shape the form of the Kan Palace. The Pilgrim’s entire account aligns with the essential aim of cultivating truth.\n\nOnly the line *\"He said his body held elixir pills, but seeking them outside is futile toil\"* directly condemns those who focus on the kidneys, refining mercury and extraction—an unlawful practice. It closely anticipates the later chapter where Tian Peng’s self-rescue represents the true, original, and natural union. *\"The monster and the Pilgrim fought until the red sun stood at noon, then withdrew to eat.\"* This is the time when kidney qi wanes at noon and heart-blood flourishes, like closing the gate to draft a letter, inviting the venerable Gold Pond. *\"Humble one\"* denotes subordination; *\"Venerable One\"* denotes superiority. The meaning is clear.",

      "translated_text": "The bear and black ape belong to fire yet appear as black men—these are the flames of desire within the kidneys; the Gold Pond belongs to wood yet is called the Cinnabar Chamber—this is the lustful fluid within the heart. Each has its season of encounter and can even offer mutual benefit, forming alliances. Drawn together by kindred qi, they say: *\"Transmit to him some qi-absorption methods.\"*\n\nThe Immortal Master, fearing readers might misconstrue the previous monk as an impure mind, thus has the Pilgrim transform into a monk to clarify that the monk is none other than the Mind-Ape. *\"Entering the cave, observing its couplets, a place of profound stillness and seclusion\"*—this originally describes the realm of understanding destiny. Yet those who practice the demonic arts of extraction without comprehending the spiritual union of intercourse fail to know destiny.\n\nAfter the deception is exposed and battle resumes, victory and defeat remain undecided. The Pilgrim says: *\"I’m not much harder—let’s just call it an even match.\"* For the Pilgrim’s unyielding strength is like true gold, while the bear’s obstinate rigidity is like crude iron. Gold and iron do not merge, their banners and drums perfectly matched. Yet stubborn iron can be transmuted into gold—it simply lacks the alchemy of refinement to be gathered.\n\nThus, the journey to the Southern Sea to seek Guanyin is introduced, making clear that the method of subjugation must still be sought in the realm of contemplative freedom. Observe the marvel of subjugation: no longer forcing the scholar to slither like a snake, but simply snapping him in two, turning white into a face; no longer allowing the mess of filling earth, but cleaving the head into a cake, transforming black into cinnabar.\n\n*\"Seeing the words ‘Crafted by Lingxuzi’ at the bottom of the tray, the Pilgrim laughed: ‘Fortune! Fortune!’\"*—for beneath these words lay the mechanism of destiny. Thus, the Bodhisattva seizes the opportunity, using the ploy to reclaim the kasaya. The immortal elixir cannot be formed apart from this, yet its function was misapplied, burying the treasure. Now, employing the very method of the other against himself, there is no need to rekindle the furnace and bell, sparing further toil. Why? True and false differ by but a single thought, yet fundamentally share the same principle. If one can master spiritual transformation, this can become that, and that can become this—this is the harmonizing elixir-head, the subtle workings of destiny in silent communion.\n\nThus, the Bodhisattva may transform into a demon, and the demon remains the Bodhisattva, revealing that self and other share a single source, never clashing. This sets the stage for the later self-mating of Metal Lord and Original Mother, who cannot bear even momentary separation. The Pilgrim eats the two immortal elixirs first—what is false can be transformed by the true; the Pilgrim then transforms anew—what is true shifts with the false. Transformation is boundless, concealment and revelation unfathomable, one becoming two, two becoming one—all is ultimately nothingness.\n\nThe moment the Pilgrim swallows the elixir, the demon is subjugated, demonstrating the principle of responsive spiritual communion. *\"Already exited through the nostrils\"*—showing the swiftness of transference. *\"The Pilgrim, fearing delay, wished to strike him dead\"*—this is *\"no merit, yet merit lies within merit.\"* *\"The Bodhisattva hastily stopped him, saying: ‘I have use for him elsewhere.’\"*—this is *\"having use, yet use is no use.\"*\n\n*\"The black man vowed to attain the true fruit; the Bodhisattva touched his crown and administered the precepts. Today, a wild heart is settled, and endless obstinacy is reined in\"*—gaining the heart of freedom while restraining the desires of the senses, as circumstances dictate.

      "translated_text": "Chapter Eighteen: The Tang Monk Escapes Peril at Guanyin Monastery; The Great Sage Subdues the Demon at Gaolao Village\n\nWu Yizi observes: The *Book of Changes* states, *\"Heaven and earth intermingle in misty vapor, and the myriad things transform into purity. Male and female unite in essence, and the myriad things come to life.\"* It clarifies that yin and yang employ union as their function. When heaven and earth unite, it is *Tai* (Peace); when mountains and marshes communicate, it is *Xian* (Mutual Joy); when water and fire merge, it is *Jiji* (Completion). Sometimes yin seeks yang, sometimes yang seeks yin; sometimes yang stirs and yin responds, sometimes yin moves and yang follows—only then can transformation and generation occur. From flying birds to hidden fish, from moving beasts to rooted plants, each possesses male and female, all following the Dao of one yin and one yang. If yin stands alone and yang is lacking, or yang stands alone and yin is lacking, then the qi of yin and yang becomes isolated and fails to unite—how can generation and transformation arise?\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* states, *\"If a hen hatches an egg alone, her chick will not be whole.\"* It also says, *\"If two women share a chamber, though their beauty be exquisite, even with Su Qin and Zhang Yi as matchmakers, their hair will rot and their teeth decay—ultimately, they will never know one another.\"* This principle is abundantly clear.\n\nThe Dao of Laozi and Zhuangzi fundamentally derives from the *Book of Changes*. Thus, Laozi says, *\"The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth. Though it seems to endure ceaselessly, its use is inexhaustible.\"* And, *\"All creatures emerge from it, and wriggling things none fail to follow.\"* Zhuangzi says, *\"Supreme yin is solemn and still; supreme yang blazes and glows.\"* He also says, *\"Though the corpse abides in stillness, the dragon appears; though the abyss is silent, thunder resounds. When the spirit moves, heaven follows.\"* For yin and yang, movement and stillness, each is the root of the other, and the Supreme Ultimate rides within them.\n\nIf one can embody the Supreme Ultimate, then the heavenly gate rests in the hand, and the earthly axis arises in the heart—this is the attainment of immortals, buddhas, and sages. But if a single thought errs, then movement and stillness alike depart from the heavenly principle; thus, the noble person values vigilance in solitude and introspection. If a single affair leans to one side, then movement and stillness alike lose their center; thus, the noble person values the investigation of things and the extension of knowledge. If one cannot investigate things and extend knowledge, but instead clings to one-sided yin or yang, cultivating only a single aspect—how can one become an immortal or buddha and transcend the mundane to enter sagehood?\n\nChen Niuwan says, *\"There is something strange yet stranger still: the affinity of heart and kidney is not Kan and Li.\"* Yuanduzi says, *\"The primordial qi of pre-heaven comes from the realm of emptiness. A single spark of yang essence is hidden within the mountain of form—not in the heart or kidney, but within the mysterious pass of the single aperture.\"* If scholars do not recognize yin and yang, do not know the proper timing, and cannot return to the source, but instead grope about within themselves, mistaking the flickering, luminous consciousness for the true reality, they will err again and again.\n\nAlas! The Dao cannot be sought externally, nor can it be grasped by groping within oneself. It is profoundly mysterious and difficult to perceive. Those false masters who mislead their disciples, recklessly conjecturing that it is the art of bedroom alchemy or inner elixirs, stray ever further from the truth. The immortal master outlines the essentials, specifically revealing Laozi and Zhuangzi’s lofty and wondrous Dao—hence the name *\"Gaolao Village.\"*\n\nIn the previous two chapters: one depicts the heart’s biased movement and the blazing of fire; the other, the kidney’s biased movement and the flaring of qi. Neither is the Dao, but rather calamity. If one mistakenly regards these two as the Dao, one falls into bias and encounters misfortune. Only by departing from this view can one escape this peril.\n\n*\"The Pilgrim turned the Black Wind Cave into a Cave of Crimson Wind\"*—this is transforming a dark chamber into a realm of light, leaving a land of misfortune to ascend a mound of blessing. As master and disciples journey, spring’s warmth unfolds. The verses with *\"mandarin ducks\"* and *\"butterflies\"* depict the scene of paired flight in settled union—an exquisite depiction of yin and yang in harmonious union.\n\nThe most awakening moment lies in the passage where the place name is inquired. Wherever the Pilgrim goes, he never treats asking the name of a place as an urgent matter.",

      "translated_text": "Here the repeated questioning is deliberate—if this place is indeed the true domain of Laozi and Zhuangzi, one cannot but investigate it with utmost care. To clarify this point is to *\"grant convenience to others and to oneself.\"*\n\nThe subtlety lies in the two phrases: *\"asking others brings no pleasure, but asking him yields commerce.\"* For to ask others is to stray from the Dao of Gao Laozhuang; to ask him, however, reveals the marvel of exchange and transaction. Later, when the Pilgrim sees the demon, he remarks, *\"So this is the trade!\"*—his heart already comprehends, echoing the earlier insight.\n\nHe says, *\"This land on the border of the Ü-Tsang kingdom is called Gao Laozhuang.\"* The crow embodies the essence of the sun; the hare, the essence of the moon. In Ü-Tsang, the hare manifests, and through their mutual resonance, the boundary becomes distinct. The lofty origins of Laozi and Zhuangzi lie precisely here. The revelation that a daughter has *\"taken in a demon as son-in-law\"* is the very subtlety of their Dao.\n\nTo give a daughter in marriage is called *\"marrying off,\"* while to take a man into the family is called *\"taking in.\"* The Dao of Laozi and Zhuangzi excels in managing yin and yang—not by following the natural course, but by reversing it. Proceeding in sequence, ordinary fathers and mothers produce mortal offspring; reversing the process, numinous father and mother give rise to immortals. A woman taking a man as her mate is like the moon receiving the sun’s light to shine. Thus, Daoists use the moon to symbolize the Dao’s essence—its meaning is abundantly clear.\n\nWhen master and disciples are introduced, the elder states that his third daughter, Cuilan, has taken in a son-in-law from Mount Fuling. *\"Third daughter\"* signifies the marvel of the youngest; *\"Fuling\"* suggests blessings as vast as a mound—implicitly evoking the trigram *dui* (joyful maiden) and *gen* (resolute strength). Fearing the Pilgrim’s ugliness, the elder remarks, *\"Ugly he may be, but he has skill.\"* He also notes that the son-in-law’s appearance and conduct are strange. The Pilgrim replies, *\"When night falls, we shall see the truth.\"* All this depicts the worldly habit of judging by outward appearances, unaware that beneath coarse robes may lie jade, or within an old clam, a pearl—hidden within are the wondrous openings to immortality and Buddhahood.\n\nThe Pilgrim, weapon in hand, shatters the demon’s barrier and calls out, *\"Summon your daughter—is she within?\"* The old man calls his daughter forth, who weeps as she describes the demon’s erratic behavior: *\"He vanishes like mist, leaving no trace.\"* One must seek the true form of one’s daughter in solitude and retrieve the whereabouts of one’s son-in-law from the depths of delusion—yet one must not cling to superficial traces and overlook the reversal of husband and wife.\n\n*\"The Pilgrim transformed himself to resemble the woman\"*—this is not a change of form, but the revelation of his true form. Why? The primordial *yi* qi is metal within water, outwardly yin but inwardly yang. In essence, he is female; thus, in terms of external yin, the Pilgrim becomes the wife—this is principle. Readers, take note: the immortal master explicitly identifies the Pilgrim as female, not as a transformed guise. The subsequent dialogue—feigned illness, sighs, and entreaties—faithfully captures the intimate exchanges of a married couple.\n\nOld Sun as the wife, Old Zhu as the husband—truly a pair heaven-made and earth-matched, a flawless and proper lady. All this is real meaning, though it may appear as playful illusion. When the Pilgrim reveals his identity as the Great Sage who wreaked havoc in Heaven five hundred years prior, Old Zhu immediately recognizes his origins and knows he can be subdued—he flees at once. The Pilgrim pursues relentlessly, like an eagle seizing a hare, like a cat pouncing on a mouse—such is the nature of their bond. *\"The karmic tie forged five hundred years ago\"*—their union was predestined, unbreakable. Let us proceed to the next chapter for a fuller account.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: Wukong Subdues Bajie in Cloud Ladder Cave; Tripitaka Receives the Heart Sutra at Floating Pagoda Mountain**\n\nWu Yizi observes: From the sixteenth chapter at Guanyin Monastery to this Cloud Ladder Cave, the interplay of metal and wood unfolds—the grand workings of true yin and true yang. Only thus does one open the gateways of the heart without falling into emptiness. This is *\"true emptiness\"*—empty yet not empty, precisely what the *Heart Sutra* means by *\"form is emptiness, emptiness is form.\"*\n\nHence, the chapter’s outline pairs *\"Wukong subdues Bajie\"* with *\"Tripitaka receives the Heart Sutra\"* as a tight parallel. To *\"subdue Bajie\"* is to receive the *Heart Sutra*. *\"Cloud Ladder\"* is the chariot of Heaven; *\"Floating Pagoda\"* is the ladder transcending Earth. Ascending from lower learning to higher attainment, step by step, one moves from effortful action to effortless Dao—this is the ultimate aim.",

The \"nine-toothed iron rake\" marks the yang number reaching its apex at nine, the very image of true yin; its operation turns with the rake, entrusted entirely to the *qi*-mechanism of bearing and movement.\n\nOld Pig’s account of his self-rescue mirrors Monkey’s own self-narration, with phrases like \"pairing yin and yang,\" \"dividing sun and moon,\" \"harmonizing dragon and tiger,\" and \"drawing in the Golden Crow\" all distilling the marrow of the Nine-Cycled Great Return Elixir. When Monkey engages him in fierce battle yet does not immediately subdue him, instead withdrawing their forces to their respective sides, he subtly highlights the three characters \"Gao Family Village\" to redirect attention to the original theme—why? Lest the world mistake victory in battle for true excellence, unaware that the highest good lies in subduing others without fighting! Here, the Dao of the Golden Elixir reveals itself as no mere art of seductive song.\n\nMonkey recounts how \"Tian Peng descended to the mortal realm, having mistakenly entered the wrong womb, yet his numinous nature remained intact.\" He adds, \"For a celestial deity to take such a son-in-law hardly tarnishes the family’s reputation.\" This shows the upright *qi* of yin and yang, incomparable to mundane malevolent spirits, thus setting up the following line: \"It’s only that there were no matchmakers or witnesses to mediate.\" Why so? The union of husband and wife depends entirely on go-betweens; without them, natures fail to harmonize. This is precisely what the *Cantong Qi* means by \"those without shared speech are no kin.\" Thus Monkey resumes the challenge, declaring, \"You don’t resemble one who forcibly seizes another’s daughter without matchmakers or witnesses\"—his intent directly foreshadowing the water monster Sha Monk as the go-between ahead, while here planting the notion to elucidate how marital discord arises from such causes.

Pig boasted of it as iron personally forged by Lord Lao, bestowed by Laozi himself—both claims truthful. \"Yet it could not so much as scratch my scalp,\" for wood cannot overcome metal. Upon hearing of the journey to the Western Heaven to seek the scriptures, Pig relinquished his rake. Why? Having received Avalokiteśvara’s clear decree, he knew that clinging solely to the rake was a one-sided attachment, incompatible with attaining true fruition—what is called \"abandoning the self to follow others\" rather than relying solely on one’s own strength. Thus he said, \"Why not have spoken sooner of the scripture-seeking matter, instead of relying on brute force to batter at my door?\" This precisely echoes the moment when Monkey subdued the young dragon, when the bodhisattva remarked, \"That monkey-head relies entirely on his own strength and refuses to praise others.\"\n\nWith sincere resolve, Pig burned his den, surrendered his weapon, bound himself, and pledged allegiance—for wood, by nature compliant and righteous, yearns for metal, just as crooked wood submits to the carpenter’s line to be made straight. Within these eight verses, the principles of metal and wood generating and overcoming one another are expounded, as are the dynamics of guest and host in harmonious exchange. When husband and wife are not estranged, their natures and dispositions remain unopposed—this is the very inception of the Western Paradise’s bliss.\n\nUpon their return after subduing Pig, Squire Gao recognized his son-in-law, and Tripitaka rejoiced in gaining a disciple, bestowing the name \"Eight Precepts.\" With evil cast aside and rectitude embraced, a feast could now be prepared to celebrate their reunion. In what follows, \"Eight Precepts seized Squire Gao, inviting my humble wife\" reveals how hard it is to sever karmic ties; \"Monkey and Eight Precepts drank the vegetarian wine\" shows how easily one succumbs to fermented brews; \"Accepting a single thread, ten thousand kalpas of cultivation are undone\" illustrates the heavy burdens of material gain; \"If the scripture quest fails, I’ll return to be a son-in-law\" exposes the fragility of the resolve for the Way; and again, \"Lest some mishap occur, the monk’s vows be broken, the wife’s marriage be lost\" reveals the futility of blind, misguided practice. Every line is a child’s song of admonition—do not dismiss it as mere idle jest.\n\nThe three disciples took their leave and set forth toward the west. The verse within—\"With harmony of disposition and settled nature, all conditions converge; when the moon fills the golden flower, the hair is shorn\"—its first line alludes in passing to the recruitment of Eight Precepts, while the second heralds the reception of the *Heart Sutra*. For once Eight Precepts was subdued, the golden elixir took form, and so, having passed the border of Ü-Tsang, they encountered the Bird’s Nest Chan Master. Why?

Profound and intricately woven, this meaning is unparalleled. Yet readers dismiss it as mere banter, casually glancing past, burying its depth.",

When conditions converge and the moon waxes full, this is the true essence. The luminous moon of Chan mind may thus be verified. This *Heart Sutra* scroll appears precisely here, like the crow concealed within the moon, bright and unstained. In its transmission of secret truths, it points the way through delusion—here lies the crux.\n\nTripitaka bowed and inquired about the road ahead. The Chan Master replied, \"The path is long, and the journey’s end will come, but demonic miasmas are not so easily dispelled.\" Thus he bestowed the *Heart Sutra*, for it alone could dissolve such afflictions. Yet the sutra held no direct signpost to the Western Heaven, so he concluded, \"This is the comprehensive scripture of true cultivation, the gateway to Buddhahood.\"\n\nTripitaka, still grasping for answers, pressed further about the way to the West. The Chan Master had already made it plain, saying, \"Ask that acquaintance of yours—he knows the road west.\" Monkey, understanding, gave a cold laugh. \"No need to ask him—ask me instead.\" Tripitaka failed to grasp his meaning.\n\nThe exchange that followed—Tripitaka seizing Monkey’s words—was the very question he sought to ask. Monkey said, \"He insulted my brother and me.\" This was a veiled answer to the road west. Tripitaka replied, \"He spoke of the western path—when did he insult you?\" One took it as an insult pointing the way; the other heard only directions, not abuse. Master and disciple, question and response—all was Chan subtlety, every word a revelation. One must awaken swiftly.\n\nMonkey said, \"You wouldn’t understand: ‘A wild boar carrying a load’—that was an insult to Eight Precepts. ‘An old stone monkey of many years’—that was an insult to me. How could you possibly grasp his meaning?\" To say *\"You wouldn’t understand\"* was to demand understanding; to say *\"How could you grasp it?\"* was to demand comprehension.\n\nThe Chan Master’s words—*\"He knows the road west\"*—were a charge to Monkey to relay the message.

      "translated_text": "Oh, how profound! Though many demonic miasmas lie ahead on the journey, why single out only the phrase *\"water monsters ahead\"*? In the mouths of those two, the great road to the Western Heaven was already laid bare—why should Tripitaka ask further?\n\nIn Chapter Twenty, *\"Tang Monk in Peril on Yellow Wind Ridge, Pig in the Vanguard at Mid-Mountain,\"* Wu Yizi says: This passage makes clear that once one has received the *Heart Sutra*, one must act swiftly, lest one mistake the mind for the Dao and thus obstruct one’s own progress.\n\nThe opening verse speaks of the practitioner of the Dao having a method—one that arises from the mind and is extinguished by the mind. But who is it that gives rise to the method, and who extinguishes it? One must discern this clearly for oneself. If one claims that all is but one’s own mind, then why rely on the words of others? One need only apply effort to the mind itself—yet this is like trying to twist iron into blood, to knot the void into form, and to expect effortless attainment. Such a path is utterly impossible. This is to mistake the thief for one’s own child—how could one ever reach the state where both mind and dharma are forgotten?\n\nOne must recognize that there exists an immortal elixir beyond such delusions. Do not let it deceive you. First, see through the five phases, shatter all obstacles with a single blow, and strive until the mind becomes no-mind, whereupon the dharma will naturally cease. Only then is it like the autumn moon in a clear sky—undivided, with both nature and destiny fulfilled.\n\nIf one claims that the mind is already the Buddha yet fails to recognize that it is neither mind nor Buddha, misinterpreting the verse *\"Since all is already the mind, why rely on the words of others?\"* as a command to rely solely on oneself, has one not strayed from the true gate? Thus, the text begins: *\"This verse is how Master Xuanzang awakened to the* Heart Sutra *and opened the gate.\"* If the mind were truly the Dao, and the Dao required nothing more, why speak of merely *\"opening the gate\"*? Why would he still journey westward to seek the true scriptures? Are the true scriptures of the Western Heaven not the teachings of others? This reasoning is clear and awakening!\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* says: *\"Qian and Kun are the gates of the* Yi.\"* Wukong and Wuneng are the gates of the *Yi*, and thus the gates of the *Heart Sutra*. To attain Wukong and Wuneng is to open the gate. Only then can one proceed with cultivation and enter the inner sanctum.\n\nEarlier, Chan Master Crow’s Nest, fearing that Tripitaka did not recognize the gate of the *Heart Sutra*, pointed to the *\"wild boar\"* and the *\"old stone monkey,\"* prompting Monkey to speak. The Elder understood the meaning, and so he recited and contemplated it constantly. A single spark of numinous light shone through—clearly the realm of *\"the setting sun conceals the fire mirror, the rising moon reveals the ice wheel.\"* The Great Dao lies ahead; one must press onward swiftly.\n\nIf one merely gropes within one’s own mind, mistaking the luminous and ever-aware consciousness for the true reality, unaware of the great road to the Western Heaven, one is like a ghost clinging to home—what is this but a *\"home-clinging ghost\"*? How can one transcend the mundane? Thus, the ancients mocked those who preserved their youth and dwelled in the world yet could not shed their shells and ascend, calling them *\"corpse-clinging ghosts.\"* Their folly is much the same.\n\nWhen Monkey says *\"your family’s ghost,\"* he scorns all those who cling to the mind in their practice. Tripitaka says: *\"Wuneng, if your heart were still so heavy with attachment to home, you would not have left it. You should return.\"* Though these words seem to reproach the fool without remorse, was Monkey truly slandering the idiot? No—he was using the fool to illustrate how clinging to the mind in cultivation is like leaving home yet still longing for it.\n\nObserve how the fool *\"comes with a dead heart, resolutely\"*—to come with a dead heart is still a method of the mind, yet to apply effort, one must have skill. But if one has only a dead heart without skill, every step will be thorny, and the path forward will be blocked. Thus, the old man shakes his head and waves his hand, saying: *\"You cannot go to the Western Heaven; you cannot obtain the scriptures.\"* Yet when Monkey reveals his true abilities, the old man says: *\"You must have some skill.\"* And again: *\"With such skill, you may yet reach the West.\"* This is the wondrous truth of Laozi and Zhuangzi.\n\nThus, the old man is made the master. The subsequent passage—*\"south of the village, two young men with an old woman, three or four children\"*—is but a shadow, the esoteric essence of Laozi’s *Daode* and Zhuangzi’s *Nanhua*, a tale that startles the foolish and shocks the vulgar, yet is the great skill for reaching the West.\n\nWhen Pig mentions *\"back in Gao Village, I often terrified mortals,\"* he exposes the truth of those who are startled by ghosts and spirits. When Monkey laughs and says, *\"Don’t speak nonsense—tidy up that ugliness,\"* he speaks of transforming the coarse into the wondrous.\n\nLater, the offering of tea, the inquiry into lineage and age—all foreshadow the perils of Yellow Wind Ridge, implying that only one with great skill like Sun Wukong can proceed. The hungry ghost who eats half a bowl of rice yet remains half-full illustrates the vast distance to the West, showing that only one with an unshakable resolve like Zhu Bajie can bear the burden.\n\nFor the mind is not the Dao. If one insists that the mind is the Dao and seeks it solely within the mind, one binds the mind with the mind and blocks the path—like the tiger demon of Yellow Wind Ridge, who tricked Golden Cicada and bound him to the wind-stilling stake. Why? The wind is *xun* wood, yellow is the center, and when they obstruct the heart and chest like a towering ridge, the tiger demon’s stubborn delusion is like the mind’s endless fixation.\n\nSee how the tiger demon *\"clutches his own chest, flays his skin, and stands by the roadside\"*—every detail vividly depicts the character *\"heart.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Thus he roared: “We are none other than the vanguard of the Yellow Wind Great King’s forces!” For to cling to the mind as the Dao is to be deluded mid-journey, blocking the path ahead. *\"Pig chased the demon into the jagged rocks and drew his twin blades of red copper.\"* The \"jagged rocks\" signify the stubborn, tangled impurity; \"twin blades,\" the discordant duality; \"red,\" the mind’s true hue; \"blades,\" the mind’s unyielding endurance. Thus the tiger demon, as the mind’s obstinate grip, serves as the mountain’s path-blocking vanguard—what need for further explanation? Pig, wielding the resolve of a dead heart, becomes the trailblazer halfway up the mountain, striking first with a single crushing blow.\n\nObserve how *\"Sanzang panicked and recited the *Heart Sutra*,\"* while the demon, equally flustered, deployed the *\"golden cicada shedding its shell\"* ruse—now transforming into a tiger, now flaying its skin—all revealing how this mind, refusing to die, twists and turns, becoming its own demon. The moment true mindfulness arises, it is the very instant the wind carries him away. It is not the tiger demon using the golden cicada to seize the golden cicada, but the golden cicada itself using the golden cicada to seize the golden cicada. *\"Clasping the Tang Monk in both hands to present him to the Great King\"* and *\"binding him in the rear garden\"*—all are acts of the Tang Monk’s own doing, self-offering, self-binding, his mind ensnared in poisonous harm, beyond liberation.\n\nPig and Monkey saw through the tiger’s skin as the cicada’s discarded shell, recognizing the trap. One stood guard, the other fought, pressing straight to the demon’s cave. Monkey exerted himself and vanquished the tiger demon; Pig seized the moment and crushed it with a single strike of his rake. This is to first eliminate the mind’s obstinacy, shattering the barriers of true emptiness. Only then can one uproot the demon’s roots and rescue the golden cicada’s wholeness. Such skill is like a harmonious couple, one leading, one responding, inner and outer aiding each other in principle—what household difficulty could remain? Thus the verse concludes: *\"When the Dharma Master meets demons in distress, / Temperament in harmony subdues the chaotic fiends.\"*\n\nThis passage begins with *\"Dharma\"* and ends with *\"Dharma Master,\"* while the next chapter’s outline immediately follows with *\"Dharma Protection,\"* clearly illustrating the method of cultivating truth, its subtle foreshadowing and hidden threads like a gray snake in the grass—those with keen eyes will surely see through it.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One: Dharma Protection Establishes a Manor to Detain the Great Sage; Mount Sumeru’s Lingji Subdues the Wind Demon**\n\n*Wu Yizi says:* This continues the preceding discourse. Having extinguished the self-aggrandizing gaze of the tiger, one must still sweep away the rat’s head with its many forks. For when the mind possesses *shishen* (discerning spirit) yet clings to self-reliance, it is dazzled by brightness and loses clarity, dispatching illumination yet failing to illuminate—its harm lies in discernment that does not discern. To recognize that *shishen* is not true is to realize that the non-spiritual in spirit is true. Hence it is said: *\"To refine spirit, refine the non-spiritual spirit.\"*\n\nScholars who fail to grasp the intent of *\"non-spiritual spirit\"* may scrutinize minutiae and spawn demons, or plunge into deep doubt and multiply delusions. Some drift into heterodox paths, others waver between two possibilities—all are blind cultivation and reckless refinement, called *\"wild blindness.\"* Han Yu said: *\"One who cannot discern the grounds of gain and loss is called wild.\"* When spirit does not guard its abode, the illness lies in the heart, like a violent wind shaking without stability. Confucius said: *\"To speak without observing another’s countenance is called blindness.\"* When heart-fire attacks the liver and assaults the eyes, it is like the Yellow Wind blowing and wounding the injured.\n\nThus, long-held stagnation breeds vermin, and accumulated delusion multiplies hardships—all stem from lack of clarity, leading to endless entanglement. This is why the *Rites* warn against *\"hesitation\"* and the *Book of Documents* values *\"decisiveness.\"* To transform hesitation into decisiveness lies in nothing but clarity. Yet clarity still does not depart from *shishen*—it is the eye-opening medicine, most urgent and precise.\n\nIn this passage, the ophthalmologist serves as the great eye, while Lingji Bodhisattva is the one who, after applying the eye-opening medicine, reveals radiant illumination. Dispelling the fleeting glimpses of confusion and awakening the unobscured wondrous vision, one stabilizes the wild, erratic wind and severs the rat’s two-pronged hesitation. The rat’s nature is thievish and suspicious; it emerges from its burrow indecisively, always wavering between two ends. Thus the old demon is an ancient rat spirit from the foothills of Vulture Peak.\n\nObserve how *\"the old demon lowered his head in silence, pondering a scheme,\"* and upon hearing the words, *\"grew even more vexed, saying, ‘This fool knows nothing!’*”*",

      "translated_text": "“I never ate his master—yet he struck down my vanguard in turn.” Such are the words of one without steadfast vision, who instead faults others. “The old demon scrutinized carefully and saw that the Traveler’s frame was coarse and stunted, not even four feet tall”—this was belittlement born of blindness. “The Traveler said, ‘You whelp, you’ve no eye for true measure!’”—this was mockery to his face. “With a single blow to the head, he grew six feet, then stood a full ten feet tall.” For the four great elements compose a body, which inherently possesses the true form of ten feet—never to be judged by outward appearance or superficial likeness.\n\n“The Traveler revealed himself and devised a plan, but the old demon mistook the feint for substance. The two fought outside the cave, the Traveler employing the art of ‘a body beyond the body.’” Thus, with many defenses confounding the senses, the eyes grew dazzled and disordered, and so harm befell them. “The old demon unleashed his yellow wind technique—using madness to counter delusion—how could heaven and earth not darken? Thus his assault targeted the eyes.” This passage expounds that chaos cannot be quelled by further chaos; only clarity suffices to end disorder.\n\n“Hairs shrank to tiny things, like wheels spinning in frenzy.” “Fire-eyes and golden pupils could not be opened.” “Pig could not dare lift his eyes or raise his head, unaware of victory or defeat, life or death, lost in doubt and hesitation”—all depict the state of wild delusion without anchor, the moment when wondrous illumination is lost. From lack of illumination arises wild delusion; from wild delusion, the mind loses its illumination. To cure wild delusion, one must first restore illumination. Thus the Traveler said, “Saving Master can wait. I don’t know if there’s an eye-doctor around—let him treat my eyes first.”\n\n“The two paused to look and saw a farmstead, its lamplight flickering dimly.” Already, within obscurity, a sliver of light had been borrowed. “The brothers sought lodging, paid respects to the old farmer, and sat with him. The Traveler asked, ‘Does anyone here sell eye medicine?’” “The elder said, ‘That’s called the *Samādhi Divine Wind*—if it blows on you, you might still live!’” Then he added, “I once met an extraordinary man who transmitted a formula called *Three Flowers, Nine Seeds Ointment*.” This is the wondrous method of *Three Flowers Gathering at the Crown* and *Ninefold Cyclic Elixir*.\n\nPig laughed, “Sir, where’s your bright staff?” The Traveler replied, “You’re treating me like a blind man.” “Pig chuckled silently, the Traveler snickered softly”—both were veiled mockery, implying that those who blindly cultivate in ignorance have never encountered a true eye-doctor. Zhuangzi said, “Healing the eyes can forestall aging.” So it is.\n\nIn the eye-medicine passage, “the guardian” is none other than *shishen*. The entire farmstead was arranged for the eye-medicine application, a provision to retain the Great Sage—indeed, the universal eye-medicine for all beings. Is the “farmstead” (*zhuang*) here any different from Zhuangzi’s “farmstead”?\n\n“The Traveler suddenly awoke; Pig guessed idly”—do not dismiss these as mere jest. They reveal the folly of those without steadfast vision and the ignorance of vulgar eyes. The verse says, “Wondrous medicine cures eye pain; vanquish demons without hesitation.” Clear and decisive, this is the moment when illumination may be attained. Thus, in the following passage, the name of Lingji Bodhisattva appears, and the Golden Star points the way.\n\nPig said, “You secretly protected Master but could not manifest openly, so you transformed this immortal farmstead.” This shows that the eye-medicine was secretly transmitted by the old farmer—a profound truth not to be openly displayed. The Traveler said, “Let me go to the cave and scout around.” Pig replied, “Find out whether he’s dead or alive. If he’s dead… if he’s not dead…”—all indecisive, wavering words, lacking illumination.\n\n“The Traveler reached the cave entrance, but it was still barred, the demons asleep.” “He transformed into a mosquito and entered; the lesser demons snored on.” All was murky confusion, a realm of dreamlike unawareness. The old demon said, “Guard the door carefully. I fear that gust of wind didn’t kill Sun Wukong.” Such was his fearful hesitation. Then, seeing “a tightly sealed inner door, he slipped inside”—already entering its *samādhi*.\n\nHe saw “Master Tang bound to the Wind-Stilling Stake”—a state of constraint and bondage, from which there was no self-liberation. The Master “could only fix his heart on Wukong and Wuneng,” showing how the mind cannot govern itself but seeks external aid. Reciting the *Heart Sutra* alone—what use was that? A lesser demon reported, “I saw a big-eared one, but not the one from yesterday.” Such was the smallness of his perception.",

Golden flames and jade mist, wisdom’s sword and virtue’s assembly”—all describing Lingji’s boundless *dharma*-power, a marvel beyond words. The Wind-Stilling Pellet was perfectly round and true, the Flying Dragon Staff swift and wondrous in its divine efficacy. “Revealing his true form, he was but a yellow weasel—having stolen oil from a lamp, dimming its flame, he fled here and became a spirit.” This was the unvarnished truth of his blindness laid bare.\n\n“Seized and brought to Vulture Peak to see the Tathāgata”—precisely the exercise of great *dharma*-power, shattering the web of doubt, attaining the radiant form, and once more beholding the Tathāgata. “The two of them slaughtered a den of cunning hares, fox-spirits, musk deer, and horned stags”—what cunning, what suspicion, what deer-like panic, what branching confusion remained?

      "translated_text": "Amidst the lotus thrones and Buddha-realms, blossoms innumerable—knitting his brows, he looked intently.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: Pig Battles the Flowing-Sands River; Mokṣa Enforces the Dharma to Subdue Wujing**\n\nWu Yizi says: “The Perfected One of Purple Yang said:\n*Tiger leaps, dragon coils—wind and waves rage rough,\nAt the central true position, the Mystic Pearl is wrought.\nThough fruit on branches ripens in due season’s span,\nHow could a child in the womb bear any pearl?*\nThis is the true purport of this chapter.”\n\nThe wondrous convergence of the Five Phases lies wholly in the two earths, wù and jǐ. Earth is the center of the Five Phases, presiding over the four seasons, each for eighteen days. Dispersed, it permeates the four times to engender and transform the myriad things; united in its twofold governance, it unifies the Nine Palaces and wondrously gathers the One Origin. Thus metal and water, meeting earth, congeal and gather; wood and fire, meeting earth, harmonize and blend. Wù is yang earth, jǐ is yin earth—metal, water, wood, and fire each possess their wù-jǐ position at the Central Palace, where the Five Phases converge and revert to the Supreme Polarity. The Supreme Polarity is but a forced designation. Though earth is one of the Five Phases, it is in truth their culmination. In the human body, it is the true; the true of intent is sincerity. With sincerity, movement and stillness are both true, and nature and feelings attain the mean—hence the noble person must make his intent sincere.\n\nSha Monk is true earth. The meanings of “flowing sands,” “weak waters,” “skulls,” and “rolled-up curtain” are all revealed in the eighth chapter. This chapter particularly clarifies that metal, water, wood, and fire cannot depart from earth; obtaining this earth, they assume their proper position at the Central Palace, whereupon the functions of the golden elixir are complete and the sagely embryo is formed.\n\nThe earlier gāthā of the Bird’s-Nest Chan Master says:\n*“The wild boar shoulders his load and goes,”*\n*“The ancient stone monkey of many years,”*\n*“The water-monster met along the way.”*\n“Met” is *gòu*, signifying the wondrousness of their encounter—thus they mutually rely on the great western road. Hence it first says: *“Having crossed Yellow Wind Ridge, one enters a stretch of level ground to the west.”* Yet why should great waters suddenly block the path, so difficult to ford? Not that it is truly hard to cross—precisely in the difficulty of crossing does one encounter and thereby attain passage, which is the great western road.\n\nYellow is the true color of the center, so from Yellow Wind Ridge the essentials of the Five Phases are drawn forth. In eight lines of verse, the embodiment of all five colors and the fullness of the Nine Palaces are depicted—each word is worthy of contemplation. When Bajie battles the monster, wood meets earth and they mutually overcome. The monster’s own account reveals the wondrousness of the three and five each as a five, within which it says: *“First I gathered the infant boy and the maiden girl, then I took up the wood-mother and metal-father as my staff.”* This is the true import. The two of them fought twice, yet through impatience could not subdue him—why?",

      "translated_text": "When hearts and minds remain unaligned, there is need for patient mediation—this cannot be forced through coercion or haste. Thus when Wukong seeks stillness through impatience, his impatience only grows; when the water monster retreats to provoke action, his movement only makes stillness harder to attain. Hence Bajie’s plea for “ten thousand strategies,” and the Monkey King’s counsel to the master: *“Do not fret,”* followed by *“go beg alms and rest,”* showing that progress in cultivation should be gradual, not rushed. The remark on *“how hard it is to carry clouds”* reveals that ordinary beings can advance step by step but not all at once. The admonition that *“no methods should be applied, only thorough experience in foreign lands”* shows that dull natures value effort over ease. The observation that *“though they could protect, they could not go ahead to fetch the scriptures”* demonstrates that spiritual practice proceeds from difficulty, not ease.\n\nWhen Bajie enters the water to challenge the monster, the origin of the treasure staff is recounted—phrases like *“length lies in the mind, thickness follows intent”* clearly reveal the operation of true intention and the mind’s radiant wisdom. *“This bout fought underwater then surfaced”* echoes the *Cantong Qi*’s *“where speech fails, they are no kin.”* The verse has already made this plain. For yin and yang to unite, true earth must mediate—just as a matchmaker is needed for a marriage. Where speech fails, hearts remain estranged, and harmony eludes. The line *“only because the wood-mother overcomes the elixir knife”* explicitly identifies Wuneng as wood and Wujing as earth.\n\n*“The monster only clamors by the riverbank, refusing to come ashore”* depicts a nature still in flux, poised between two possibilities—most elusive to grasp. Once impatience takes hold, the creature vanishes without a trace, leaving no opening for action. Thus when Wukong’s temper flares and he leaps into a somersault, the monster conceals himself completely, nowhere to be seen. Only by turning inward in quiet reflection and summoning Guanyin Bodhisattva can the original face be revealed. Wukong then hastens to the Southern Sea to pay homage. The Bodhisattva says: *“You ape, ever relying on your own strength, unwilling to speak of protecting the Tang monk. Had you mentioned ‘the scripture-seeker,’ he would have submitted at once.”* For the protection of the scripture-seeker is the shared purpose of the three. To speak of *“the scripture-seeker”* is to establish common speech, align hearts, and dissolve suspicion through mutual sincerity.\n\nThe Bodhisattva calls Huian to fetch the red gourd, bids Wujing take refuge, and arranges the nine skulls in the pattern of the Nine Palaces, placing the gourd at the center—forming a dharma-boat. Excellent indeed! The Great Being’s compassionate vessel ferries the world, revealing the system of the golden elixir.",

Thus, the Curtain-Lifting General is the true earth of true yin and true yang, the Yellow Dame of marital union, the essential subtlety of forming the embryo and establishing the foundation.\n\nMujaku then calls forth Wujing, who sincerely submits. The skulls are removed, the Nine Palaces arranged, the gourd placed at the center, and the master invited to sit upon it. Lightly and steadily they cross, waves calm and winds still; in no time, they reach the far shore. Truly, this is the great function of establishing life and destiny, of planting the feet firmly on solid ground.\n\nYet why is it also called *\"pure and non-action\"*? For though there is action, it does not adhere—like the Bodhisattva sending Mujaku to demonstrate the dharma without going herself. The operation lies with Wukong and Wuneng, the boat is formed by Wujing, while the Tang monk enjoys non-action. Though there is action, it is in truth non-action.\n\nWhen Mujaku retrieves the gourd, it transforms into yin qi, the two earths become true, and the Nine Palaces merge completely. From this, the foundation is set, the golden elixir takes form, and the Way of non-action gradually manifests.\n\nAh! The method of the golden elixir’s function is clearly revealed here!",

      "translated_text": "In Chapter Twenty-Three: \"The Tang Monk Remembers His Origin; The Four Sages Test Meditative Resolve\"\n\nWu Yizi says:\nThe Five Phases converge and cluster, forming the sacred embryo.\nThe original root is already attained, and life and destiny have their foundation.\nFrom this point, one preserves and nurtures it, gradually shedding the embryo to approach spiritual transformation—thus may celestial immortality be realized.\n\nYet I fear that worldly people may misconstrue the wondrous Dao of convergence and clustering as the heterodox teaching of \"absorbing yin to supplement yang,\" becoming infatuated at the sight of beauty, sinking into the sea of desire, forgetting their origin and drowning in mere words—how truly pitiable! Therefore, this passage urgently highlights how easily one may be deluded by feminine allure, and how crucial it is to maintain steadfast vigilance, never forgetting one’s original face.\n\nThus it is said: \"This chapter of the tale reveals that the Way of seeking the scriptures does not depart from the Way of attending to the root within one’s own body.\" Ah! The immortal master’s words are most subtle—\"attending to the root\" runs through the entire work. Should one glance superficially, the profound principle would be buried and lost.\n\nThis \"root\" does not refer to what lies near or within, but rather to that which, in the opening chapter, precedes heaven and earth as the primordial spiritual root, and which, after the Five Villas’ episode, permeates the later heaven and earth, yet remains the primordial spiritual root. Every person possesses it in full, lacking nothing. Those who have lost it must attend to it to return; returning is but the restoration of what was originally present within. Those who have not lost it must attend to it to avoid forgetting; forgetting means forgetting what was never originally present within. Those who have lost and then regained it must attend to it to preserve it; preservation means securing what was originally present within, letting go of what was not, and fortunately returning to what was.\n\nHence it is said: \"The Way of seeking the scriptures does not depart from the Way within one’s own body.\" In the verse, \"the wayward monkey firmly bound\" and \"the inferior horse diligently reined\" are acts of discipline upon the ground of inherent nature; \"Wood Mother and Metal Duke\" and \"Yellow Dame with Crimson Child\" are functions upon the root of life.

      "translated_text": "Should the slightest thought of slackness arise, it is a sign of failing to bear the burden fully—idleness and desire will then gradually sprout. If there is any impulse toward hasty progress, it is a sign of reckless haste and overstepping, inevitably leading to unruliness that cannot be reined in. Pigsy, resenting the weight of his load and urging the horse to speed, thus sows the seeds of trouble. This is like the Monkey King wielding his staff to tame the wayward ape, or spurring the inferior horse to gallop—both acts of discipline.\n\nThe episode \"Testing the Chan Mind\" is overt in its meaning, yet its subtlety lies beyond the words. For while testing the mind is the manifest intent, the alchemical method is still concealed within. Why? To test the mind is merely to test it—one or two beauties would suffice to captivate the soul; why wait for four? Yet the Dao is called the interplay of one yin and one yang. The master and his three disciples naturally form a fourfold harmony, the true number of yin and yang in balance, where none can be lacking. Only when one sees beauty as no beauty and faces temptation without attachment does one attain the unyielding, indestructible body. Scholars may find it easy to sever ties with the world and renounce all things, but when the body itself is subjected to restraint and confronted with temptation, the mind often shifts and resolve is lost.\n\nTo achieve true mastery, one must pass through the crucible of tribulation; to recognize pure gold in its full luster, it must be forged in searing flames. The trial by the Four Saints is like testing gold with a touchstone: when gold meets the touchstone, its true grade is revealed; when one encounters the trial of the Four Saints, the sacred and the profane are fully exposed. Nothing in the world stirs the heart more easily than beauty; if one remains unmoved by it, nothing can move the heart at all. This is why the transformed maiden tests them—like refining with fire, only true gold remains unaltered.\n\nIn the alchemical method, the female seeks the male, as in a marriage where the groom is brought into the bride’s home. This is no ordinary union, so the Four Saints take the form of women awaiting childbirth to summon a husband, with Pigsy as the groom and Friar Sand as the matchmaker. Yet the Four Saints are nothing other than the true qi of the One. From the One they become four, and from these four arise countless transformations—just as the Great Sage’s true gold can manifest boundless change. Only the Great Sage perceives this and recognizes the subtle work of enlightenment. The hidden meaning of the text is thus made clear.",

      "translated_text": "The woman said, “I was born in the year *dinghai*, on the third day of the third month, at the *you* hour. Thus my husband is three years older than I.” “Three years older” means he belongs to the *shen* year. *Shen* is the Monkey—nothing other than the true *qi* of the One. This estate was left by one born in the Year of the Monkey, so are his wife and daughter not transformations of those not born in the Year of the Monkey? The mother and three daughters together total ninety-nine years in age, the extreme of yang numbers—this is the principle of old yang transforming into yin and producing the daughters.\n\nThe *Baihutong* states: “Fire is so called because it transforms.” Thus we know metal can transform into fire, and fire in turn can transform into metal. Here, the four women become the raging fire of four crucibles, and whatever encounters them is inevitably melted and refined. At first, one relies on this fire to congeal the elixir, and in the end, one relies on it to refine the elixir. This transformation is the most essential fire-work in the alchemy of the golden elixir, sufficient to forge and temper one into truth.\n\nHow do we know this is fire? The woman said, “I was born in the year *dinghai*.” Is not *ding* fire? Is not *hai* the wood that generates fire? And are they not in a pine and cypress grove, where the art thrives and fire blazes? If so, then her boasts of vast fields, livestock, silks, and embroideries are all the radiance of fire; her praises of Zhenzhen, Aiai, and Lianlian’s beauty are all the spirit of fire; her descriptions of the enjoyments of spring, summer, autumn, and winter are all the movement of fire. Her “sudden rage, turning to enter the screen, and bolting the waist-door” is the rising and falling of fire. Her disregard for Pigsy’s ugliness and eagerness to take him as a son-in-law, so long as he can manage the household, is fire’s indiscriminate melting of jade and stone alike.\n\nHer “suddenly opening the door with a shout, raising a red lantern and a censer, fragrant clouds swirling, the clatter of jade pendants, leading the women in worship” is the fierce, swirling, searing, and refining power of fire. Her “leaving behind a pair of gauze lanterns, leading the fool step by step, the hall aglow with silver candles” is fire’s flickering brilliance, its thoroughness and precision, leaving no place to hide. Her words to the three daughters, giving them handkerchiefs to cover their heads and failing to find a match, are the unpredictable, lively, and elusive nature of fire. Her returning to the room, handing over a pearl-embroidered robe, and binding the fool are fire’s twisting restraint, its intricate and inescapable grasp.\n\n“Those people vanished in an instant, leaving behind a grand hall with carved beams and painted rafters” is fire’s transformative concealment, its marvelous and swift changes, which cannot be grasped by form. When Pigsy “twisted left and right, unable to endure, repeatedly saying ‘let’s discuss this later’; letting go of the reins, calling his mother to arrange the marriage, boasting of his skills, declaring ‘no need to negotiate,’ his lust in disarray, insisting on bowing to them all, ‘all must cover their heads for me,’ and when he failed to catch them, you beckoned me; when he put on the pearl robe and fell to the ground”—all this is the state of being refined by fire, flying and leaping uncontrollably, bound and restrained, losing one’s original nature.\n\nThe most crucial point in this passage is Pigsy’s words, “In my youth, I once learned the method of *aozhan*.” Those who recklessly practice *caizhan* take female beauty as their crucible, believing the perverse doctrine of “absorbing yin to supplement yang,” thereby burning themselves to death—like moths flying into flame. How lamentable! Thus the poem concludes with its true meaning: *“The foolish do not know the root cause, / The sword of desire wounds the body in secret.”* This is the harm of seeking scriptures outside the body while neglecting the root.\n\nThe verse within states: *“From this, wash the heart and reform the faults.”* This is the essential point: after congealing the elixir, one must thoroughly wash the heart and guard against desire. Without guarding against desire, the original root, once obtained, will be lost again—how pitiful! If one can henceforth not forget the original root, only then is one truly virtuous. Thus it is also said: *“From the correct path, cultivate with care, / Sweep away love and desire to return to truth.”*\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four: The Immortal of Longevity Hill Keeps an Old Friend / The Handsome Monkey King Steals the Ginseng Fruit at Wuzhuang Temple**\n\n*Wu Yizi* says: These five or six chapters together elucidate that consuming the golden elixir is the original root of the body. Within the chapter, the “ginseng fruit of Wuzhuang Temple” expounds the principle of the golden elixir. The “Pure Wind and Bright Moon” striking the fruit and the “elixir plate” receiving it reveal the name of the golden elixir. Its meaning is drawn from the *Doctrine of the Mean*: “Establishing the great root of the world, one can assist heaven and earth in their positions and nurture the myriad things,” transforming the intent of “stiff flesh” into a wondrous awakening, deeply sufficient to break through deafness and enlighten the vulgar. If readers remain ignorant and dismiss it as absurd and unorthodox, they are like the mice in the pine and cypress, unaware of the fine cedar within the hall.\n\n*Can* means “three.” The *Book of Changes* says: “Three for heaven, two for earth, and thus the numbers are established.” One, three, and five are the numbers of heaven; two and four are the numbers of earth. Three threes make nine, the number of old yang; three twos make six, the number of old yin. Two threes and one two make eight, the number of young yin; two twos and one three make seven, the number of young yang. All are “three for heaven, two for earth.” Three multiplied by two is five, which ultimately returns to one. One paired becomes three; three and five transform into three. Three threes are three; five fives are five. Extending this to a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, or a hundred million, and even to the infinite, there is nothing that is not “three and two,” nothing that is not one.",

      "translated_text": "Thus the Dao of Heaven is without beginning or end, and through the reckoning of numbers one may infer its mechanism. The Dao of Heaven is most wondrous, and by means of numbers one may illuminate the true principle. Principle is made manifest through numbers, and numbers emerge from principle; they may rely upon each other but may not be violated—hence it is called “relying on numbers.”\n\nWhat is the One? It is the primordial *qi* of True Unity. Master Zhu said: “Heaven, through yin and yang and the Five Phases, transforms and gives birth to the myriad things. *Qi* forms their shapes, and principle is also bestowed upon them. This principle does not depart from *qi*, nor does *qi* depart from principle.”\n\nThe Way of the Golden Elixir takes the cultivation of *qi* as its foundation. The essence of cultivating *qi* lies in accumulating righteousness. If one cannot accumulate righteousness but instead feels shame when looking up and remorse when looking down, then principle is lost and *qi* is obstructed—how can it then fill Heaven and Earth with its vastness? Thus the Way of the Immortals, when it reaches Mencius’ teaching on “cultivating *qi*,” is nearly fully revealed. And when it is said that this *qi* is born of “accumulating righteousness,” the methods of the Elixir are almost complete. Those who cling to emptiness and stillness without understanding the accumulation of righteousness and cultivation of *qi*—the work of the heart—will ultimately perish.\n\nHuman life is like a fleeting glimpse of a horse or a dream of a butterfly; Heaven’s mandate is without constancy. One must swiftly turn the light inward, sever desires, and follow principle, embracing impartial vastness. When principle is attained, one’s nature is restored; when nature is restored, life is consolidated. With the vastness of the eye attained, this is called accumulating righteousness and cultivating *qi*; this is called establishing oneself and securing one’s destiny. Its most crucial point lies in vigilance in solitude.\n\nIn a single thought of numinous clarity, preserve the genuine and eliminate the false, never departing from it for even a moment. What Heaven has bestowed upon me is only this; and what I use to practice virtue and attain the Dao is only this. Relying solely on this as the master, one is not swayed by emotions nor bound by names and conventions. Gain and loss, constant change—none of these are heeded. This is what it means to be steadfast.\n\nVigilance renders the heart’s ground empty and vast—this is the state before arousal, the establishment of the great root of the world, the original face of human life. Unfallen into being or non-being, unconfined by place, without sound or scent, it is the undifferentiated Great Ultimate. Confucius’ joy was in this; Yan Hui’s unchanging joy was in this. Li Yanping’s silent sitting and embodied realization were realizations of this; Lu Xiangshan’s “first establishing the great” was first establishing this. Chen Baisha’s emergence of signs in stillness—this was the very sign.\n\nThose who have not yet recognized this must still it to perceive it; those who have recognized it must still it to nurture it. When stillness reaches its extreme and movement arises, one must move to embody this; when engaging with affairs and encountering things, one must face circumstances to verify this. This is what is meant by observing the mechanism of movement and stillness, being and non-being, and preserving the all-encompassing, unfathomable spirit.\n\nOnce the great root is established, the thousand branches and ten thousand leaves all flourish and grow unimpeded. Thus one can establish the heart for Heaven and Earth, secure the destiny of the people, and assist Heaven and Earth in nurturing the myriad things.\n\nYet even when one has fully attained this spirit—luminous and numinous, capable of responding to myriad changes, foreseeing past and future, equalizing life and death, transcending the mundane and entering sagehood—one may consider it the ultimate and complete, true and without further addition. But how is this spirit merely the yin spirit of the postnatal, not the yang spirit of the prenatal? When the Four Great Elements disperse, it remains solitary and is still bound by the regulations of Heaven and Earth, unable to regulate them. Heaven and Earth must settle this spirit in the place of utmost yang before it can fully attain its original root. The original root lies where I was born, inseparable from the primordial *qi* of True Unity.\n\nThough principle is not mixed with *qi*, it is never apart from *qi*. Thus where *qi* transforms, there too is the abode of spirit and principle. *Qi* has no luminous, numinous spirit, but possesses a spirit of profound obscurity. The spirit that is not spirit is the ultimate spirit; the spirit of the ultimate spirit is the ultimate truth. When people speak of this spirit, they are utterly at a loss. Even those who claim to recognize it do not know where to begin, and some dismiss it entirely with the phrase “seeking the obscure and practicing the strange!”\n\nConsider this: the *River Chart*, the *Luo Writing*, and the *Great Change* are the ancestral methods of the ancient divine sages, transmitted in the hearts of the Zhou and Confucius to enlighten later generations. What they expound—yin and yang in their proper and reversed sequences, the principles of the prenatal and postnatal—are these truly “seeking the obscure and practicing the strange”?\n\nI do not say that fully attaining this luminous, numinous, and unwavering spirit is not the true Way, but rather that only when one reaches the utmost can one fully attain the luminous, numinous, and unwavering as the ultimate truth. Thus it is said: “If you wish for the Valley Spirit never to die, you must establish the root in the Mysterious Female.”\n\nLet me clarify the meaning of this passage: At the beginning of the chapter, the Eight Precepts were bound by selfish desires, having lost their original root. The Traveler’s words in the *Xun* trigram faintly illuminated a hundred aspects, reminding and arousing their sense of shame and innate goodness. The *West River Moon* verse states: “There is only one original root, with no trifling profit to add to the bag. Safeguard this capital well, firmly guard it and do not let it dissipate.” This speaks of preserving what has not been lost, returning what has been lost, and, having lost and then returned, being vigilant—there is only one, with no possibility of addition.\n\nFrom this, one knows that the depravity of those who practice sexual arts is like the Eight Precepts fainting in confusion, senseless. The Eight Precepts, ashamed, said: “From now on, I will never dare to act recklessly.” This is the moment of a scholar’s repentance and entry into the Way. Thus the author, in concluding the harm of lust, subtly reveals the root—this is the One.\n\nThe number One is contained within Five and reaches its utmost in the myriad. The outline speaks of “Mount Everlife,” and the inexhaustible myriad myriad is already encompassed within the myriad; it speaks of the “Abbey of Five Estates,” and the boundless permutations of five are already unified within Five.",
      "overlap_context": "and one two make eight, the number of young yin; two twos and one three make seven, the number of young yang. All are “three for heaven, two for earth.” Three multiplied by two is five, which ultimately returns to one. One paired becomes three; three and five transform into three. Three threes are three; five fives are five. Extending this to a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, or a hundred million, and even to the infinite, there is nothing that is not “three and two,” nothing that is not one.",

Paired with the Five Teachings, they become benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust; united in the One Origin, they form the Primal Chaos and the Supreme Ultimate. The text explicitly states: “When the Primal Chaos first divided and the Vast Mist began to separate, at the moment before Heaven and Earth unfolded, this Spiritual Root was produced.” This Spiritual Root is the same as the Spiritual Root in the opening chapter, yet it distinguishes between the prior-to-Heaven and the posterior-to-Heaven: the former, existing before Heaven and Earth, is the Spiritual Root that gives rise to Heaven and Earth—what is meant by “There is something prior to Heaven and Earth,” which is the prior-to-Heaven that Heaven does not transgress; the latter, arising after Heaven and Earth, is the Spiritual Root produced by Heaven and Earth—what is meant by “Within it lies a treasure, hidden in the mountain of form,” which is the posterior-to-Heaven that Heaven does not transgress. It emerges from the prior-to-Heaven and enters the posterior-to-Heaven. The Spiritual Roots of prior and posterior to Heaven are ultimately one qi, ultimately the Great Root, ultimately the progenitor of the Five Phases. Those who study the Dao, if they can obtain this prior-to-Heaven qi within the posterior-to-Heaven, can thereby master this qi to govern the myriad principles of the posterior-to-Heaven, without falling into isolation.\n\nThe outline speaks of the “Great Immortal”—between Heaven and Earth, only this Root is great; of the “Pilgrim”—between Heaven and Earth, only this is the movement of the Five Phases; of “retaining old friends”—retaining the old refers to traces already manifest; of “stealing the ginseng”—stealing the ginseng praises the power of Heaven and Earth. The text’s declaration to “offer incense and worship solely to the words ‘Heaven and Earth’” makes the fundamental intent clear. The boy says, “These two words—the one below cannot receive our incense,” meaning it belongs to yin and is insufficient to match the marvel of Heaven.

      "translated_text": "Here the Tang Priest has reached this stage—though he recognizes the original Root, he cannot examine it with true insight. To advance further, the original Root remains the original Root, yet still eludes his grasp. Only through reverent seeking, wholehearted devotion, and unwavering aspiration can it be fully preserved without loss. As the saying goes, “Recognizing the original Root is but the beginning of true work”—mere empty awakening does not bring one to Vulture Peak. Thus the Pilgrim speaks of such difficulty, urging him to sudden awakening: “If only your mind is sincere in seeing your nature, every moment of turning back is Vulture Peak itself.” This echoes the *Zhou Odes*: “Learning ever shines brighter toward radiance,” warning against needless doubts of distance or separation, lest the original Root be grasped and then lost again.\n\nOnly the Five-Zhuang Temple of Western Ox-Head Continent yields this “Herb of Returned Elixir,” also called “Ginseng Fruit.” The West is the direction of Lesser Yin, corresponding to autumn, the season when the myriad things bear fruit. Fruit embodies yang within yin—postnatal qi harboring the prenatal One. That ginseng grows between Heaven and Earth to become fruit follows the same principle. The character *草* (herb) is composed of *甘* (sweet), *日* (sun), and *十* (ten): two figures paired, encompassing the numbers of Heaven (one), Earth (ten), and the four directions with the center. Within lies the utmost yang, combining to form its image—hence *草* (herb), which also means “early,” urging swift return of the elixir. This is the true gold of the Golden Elixir, the rightful heir of returning to the origin—thus the name “Zhen Yuanzi” (Master of the Origin). If one can consume it, partaking of Heaven and Earth to become all things, how is this not to reign as lord of the world?\n\n“It bears fruit once every three thousand years; to smell one grants three hundred and sixty years of life; to eat one, forty-seven thousand.” Among his scattered immortals, countless in number, forty-eight remain in sight. He takes forty-six to Heaven, leaving two to guard the temple: one aged one thousand three hundred and twenty, the other one thousand two hundred. Though the numbers of Three Heavens and Two Earths are interwoven to depict its marvel, this is no empty talk but solid truth—all ultimately deriving from the One and Five, extending to the myriad things.\n\nMaster Zhen Yuan instructs Pure Wind and Bright Moon to pluck ginseng fruit in welcome of old friends. The two lads, citing Confucius’ words, doubt they share the same path, revealing their deep understanding of how worldly scholars cling to Confucianism and doubt the Dao. The Great Immortal, recalling the Buddha’s assembly, clarifies their bond as old friends, pointing to the shared origin of Dao and Confucianism. When master and disciples arrive at the temple, they admire the scenery, read the couplets within, and inquire of Pure Wind and Bright Moon—yet these are not the “Heaven and Earth” incense offerings, for they speak of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy inviting one to taste the Dao Fruit of Chaos. All describe the reality of Two Earths and Three Heavens, the profound mystery of the prenatal True One, though people fail to recognize it.\n\nThe Pilgrim’s mischief is no mere temper—it exposes how worldly folk all claim sagely wisdom and heroic might. Even one as spiritually awakened as the Pilgrim struggles to yield and believe; how rare, then, are true kindred spirits! The Tang Priest, unaware of this rare treasure, trembles and retreats three feet—not from ignorance, but to show how worldly eyes, even in one with deep karmic roots like the Tang Priest, find it hard to receive such guidance. How many, then, abandon themselves to fate!\n\nPig, drooling with greed, schemes to taste the new; the Pilgrim turns invisible, climbs the tree, and steals the fruit. When one falls and vanishes, they summon the local earth god to investigate. This reveals how all covet the Golden Elixir, yet without true knowledge, none dare consume it hastily. The Pilgrim calls himself “the most notorious thief under Heaven”—no idle boast, for this path steals from Heaven and Earth, seizing the workings of creation, truly the ringleader of the treasury of principle.\n\nThe earth god says: “This fruit fears the Five Phases: it withers at wood, dissolves in water, burns in fire, and sinks into earth. Only when struck by metal does it fall; only when wrapped in silk can it be held.” For the Golden Elixir is the primordial qi of chaos, not leaning toward any single phase. To favor one is to fail in bearing true fruit—no margin for error, as the saying goes: “A hair’s breadth of deviation and the elixir will not form.”\n\nThe Great Sage steals three; the three share them, united in purpose. Pig, insatiable in greed, clamors and ruins the plan, unable to guard against danger. The two lads revile the Tang Priest, who says: “Virtue and righteousness matter most; have them apologize.” Yet the three disciples deny all—proof that the Tang Priest cannot partake of the Golden Elixir, foreshadowing the later uprooting of the tree. The Golden Elixir harmonizes the Five Phases and embodies the Five Virtues: the Tang Priest’s hesitation is lack of wisdom; the disciples’ denial, lack of faith. Without wisdom and faith, two of the Five Virtues are missing, three of the Five Phases unbalanced. With the root shaken, the fruit vanishes—is this not the inevitable workings of principle and fate?\n\nNote: To the west of Persia lies a kingdom called Dashi. Its king often sends men by ship with provisions into the sea. After eight years, they still have not reached the western shore. In the sea, they see a square stone, upon which grows a tree with red branches and green leaves. On the tree, countless infants, six or seven inches long, neither speak nor cry but all can smile, moving their hands and feet, their heads fixed to the branches. When plucked, they wither and blacken in hand. The envoy brings back one branch, now kept by the king of Dashi. From this, we see such trees truly exist in the world—far from absurd. The immortal master merely borrows this to expound the Dao of the Golden Elixir, partaking of the creative workings of Heaven and Earth.",

      "translated_text": "Those of limited knowledge like Jia Dao and Meng Jiao, unaware even of the infant tree, how could they ever grasp the wonders of the Golden Elixir!\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: The Immortal Zhenyuan Gives Chase to Seize the Pilgrim Monks; Sun Wukong Raises Havoc at Wuzhuang Temple**\n\nWu Yizi observes: The earlier verse states, *\"There is but one original root—no trifling profit to swell the purse.\"* Yet Zhu Bajie, in his greed, seeks to add where nothing is to be gained; Tang Sanzang, in his ignorance, resists and obstructs. Whether excessive or deficient, both fail to savor the true flavor—for the flavor lies in the original.\n\nThe root is first uprooted; whence then does the Dao arise? If one does not thoroughly investigate and firmly cultivate this fundamental root, it is to abandon the source for the branches, to remain ignorant of the hidden mechanism within one’s sleeve. One may attempt to steal across Chen Cang in darkness, yet know not that one’s footing is weak. No matter how cunning the schemes, no matter how extreme the transformations, all remain but illusory passions and false appearances—shifting and erring, turning back and forth, with no means of deliverance. Would this not delay the journey, preventing one from ever reaching the Western Heaven and beholding the Buddha’s face? As the saying goes: *\"The halo behind the neck is still illusion; clouds beneath the feet do not make one an immortal.\"*\n\nThis is like the Great Sage toppling the tree’s fruit, whereupon the two youths bolt the layered gates, declaring: *\"You’ve ruined the immortal root of our Wuzhuang Temple! If you wish to reach the Western Heaven and pay homage to the Buddha, you’ll have to turn back, re-enter the wheel of rebirth, and be born again!\"* Stern in word and just in principle, their admonition is as thunderous as a hibernating dragon’s roar, as nurturing as a compassionate sail in the rain.\n\nYet Wukong laughs, revealing the truth; the two youths curse, branding him a thief; Bajie clamors to strike, taking sides—all mistaking the false for the true. How could they not forsake the real for the illusory? By uprooting the divine tree and severing the elixir’s lineage, their cry of *\"Let’s all scatter!\"* is as apt as *\"When the tree falls, the monkeys disperse\"*—precise and unerring. The verse *\"Wukong has ruined the Herb of Returning Life; the bright moon and clear wind chill the heart and gall\"* serves as the sharpest awakening.\n\nFor one must first act, then gradually attain effortless mastery. If one merely awakens to the emptiness within *\"emptiness\"* but fails to recognize the *\"fruit of emptiness\"* within that emptiness, what result can a single awakening yield? Is this not to lose the Returning Elixir in the very act of awakening? Though the clear wind and bright moon remain, how can they be enjoyed? In the end, one will still fall into the dust, unable to accomplish anything.\n\nLocking the gates and lying are but mixed tactics—where then is the method to revive the dead? Adding greens and serving tea are but misapplied, rigid views; shutting the doors and hurling abuse only create a scene of verbal strife. Unlocking the gates to flee by night is but groping in the dark—though one may temporarily escape the cage, one cannot evade the net. Rushing forth while others sleep is but stumbling and falling—though one may strive forward, one will ultimately lag behind.\n\nThus, Immortal Zhenyuan awakens the two drowsy youths to investigate the root of the harm, and pursues them for nine hundred *li* to seize back the reckless ones who have obscured their origin. His mastery of the universe within his sleeve is like the strings that manipulate puppets—what is meant by *\"The Heavenly Gate in hand, the Earth’s Axis born in the heart.\"*\n\n*\"Each tied to a single pillar\"* shows that every person is inseparable from their fundamental root—how can one stand without relying on it? The hasty use of the Seven-Star Whip made from dragon skin to strike them reveals that each must be interrogated to uncover their origin—how can one not reflect deeply and gain insight! *\"Striking the legs\"* strikes at their unsteady footing—how can they wander recklessly? *\"Substituting the blows\"* substitutes repeated inquiry so that they may hasten forward.\n\nIf one relies on cleverness and deploys petty wit, seeking to use the fragile willow’s form for the plan of rebirth and transformation, this is to take the false as real—even the real becomes false. Like stealing away at midnight, it is nothing but a dream. When master and disciples transform the willow tree into an illusory body while obscuring the truth that the human and tree are the real body, how can the elder not nod off in the saddle, his foundation unsteady?\n\nOnce reproached, their guilt collapses; the Great Immortal catches up and seizes them again, binding them as before. He wraps the three in cloth, then lacquers them—those who obscure their origin do so because they cannot turn inward to illuminate themselves. The many-eyed cloth is wrapped tightly around them so that their entire bodies may grow eyes to seek clarity; the outer lacquering ensures that, though the exterior is dark, the interior may shine with self-awareness. If one cannot turn inward to awaken to the root, one is not far from death—even if revived from such a tight encasement and lacquered for burial, it is still a stroke of fortune. Who would say it is inappropriate?\n\nWhy is Wukong alone ordered into the oil cauldron? Oil is water; the cauldron is metal. Beneath it burns wood and fire; within it lies stone and earth. Though the five phases gather in their forms, they remain easily stained by grease and fat. Moreover, they are divided and disharmonious, unable to unite as one. If scholars do not fathom the deep source within but merely follow the external traces, their desiccation will come swiftly.\n\nToppling the immortal root serves to chastise the confusion of truth and falsehood; mistaking the false for the true serves to test one’s exhaustion.

The difficulty of descending into the oil cauldron is like the difficulty of ascending to the Western Heaven! Only by enduring the oil cauldron can one ascend to the Western Heaven. Wukong may be able to descend but cannot; he may be able to ascend but cannot.

      "translated_text": "Otherwise, like passing through the Wuzhuang Temple only to miss the ginseng fruit before one’s very eyes—is this not to be without sentiment and seed, and how then can there be nature and life? The Venerable Xue Daoguang, with his wondrous awakening beyond the dust, keen wisdom, and perfect comprehension, ultimately turned inward in reflection, yet deemed it not the supreme vehicle. Seeking out a true person and receiving guidance, he was drenched in sweat and suddenly repented his past errors. Thereupon, he cast off his monastic robes, returned to lay life, and concealed himself in a bustling metropolis, relying on the powerful to resolve his great matter before attaining the true fruit. This was Daoguang’s turning inward to seek the method, humbling himself to gain benefit.\n\nThus it may be known that mere awakening is not the true seed, and without sentiment, nature cannot be fulfilled. Mencius said, *\"Whether one dies young or lives long, one does not waver; one cultivates the self and awaits destiny—this is how to establish one’s mandate.\"* Master Jing said, *\"Though one stands unmoving at the hundred-foot pole’s tip, to have entered thus is not yet true. Take one more step at the hundred-foot pole’s tip, and the ten directions are your entire body.\"* The *Awakening to Reality* states, *\"Only when medicine meets its kindred qi does it take form; the Dao resides in the subtle and imperceptible, harmonizing with nature. Once the golden elixir is swallowed into the belly, one knows at last that my destiny is not ruled by Heaven.\"* All speak of exhausting one’s nature to reach destiny, obtaining the primordial utmost essence as the supreme vehicle of the Great Dao.\n\nThose who study the Dao in cultivating the self and dwelling in the world must not rely on self-strength; they must empty their minds, humble themselves before others, guard against deceit, and seek instruction—only after diminishing again and again can they gain true benefit.\n\nSun Wukong, with his divine transformations and extraordinary prowess, protected the Tang Monk, believing himself invincible in his strength—yet how much more invincible was the protection afforded by the ginseng fruit! How could Wukong escape the grasp of Zhenyuan? Why? Because empty awakening is not as real as the fruit.\n\nThe eight opening lines precisely diagnose the root malady, and the concluding line—*\"For those stubborn in their rigidity, there are always others more rigid still\"*—reveals that those mired in self-adherence remain utterly deluded. When the Immortal Zhenyuan took the pilgrim’s hand, it was the mechanism to guide the Tang Monk; when he demanded the tree be restored, it was to urge the cultivation of the Tang Monk’s root. He further said, *\"If you can revive the tree, I will bow to you eight times and take you as my sworn brother.\"* For friendship is the mutual aid of having and lacking, and fraternal love is the support of hand and foot.\n\nThe immortals’ path begins with action and culminates in non-action—having is none other than non-being. If one cannot act as having, how can one act as non-having? The Buddha’s path begins with non-action and arises from action—non-being remains being. If one cannot be without non-being, how can one be with being? In silent accord and shared intent, they originally form a single principle, all seeking the same method of reviving the dead.\n\nThough this passage speaks of the Monkey King’s quest across three isles for a remedy, it truly reveals the two schools’ unity in their original source. Could the Great Immortal not heal the tree himself? Yet he specifically invited Guanyin—this is to clarify that non-being precedes being, and to show that transformation has its wellspring. Though master and disciple each possessed their own spiritual root, they deferred to the Immortal Zhenyuan—this is to clarify that the self resides within others, and that their qi is not two.\n\nFrom this discernment and pursuit, even the Three Stars of the Eastern Sea could not surpass its wonder. Naturally, they converged at Wuzhuang Temple, adding longevity, fortune, and prosperity. Even the Eastern Flower Patriarch could not surpass its divinity, and so extolled Wuzhuang Temple as a blessed land, a cave heaven, a spiritual root. Though the Nine Elders of Yingzhou could not advance further, they marveled at Wuzhuang Temple, hastening to welcome its master, offering him nectar to drink and jade lotus to eat.\n\nZhu Bajie tugging at the Star of Fortune to beg for fruit, rummaging about in chaos—this reveals his heavenly nature. Wukong laughing at Dongfang Shuo for stealing peaches without success, their mutual jesting—this too shows that it was not truly possessed. All these scenes, reflected through the ginseng fruit, in jest and play, truly convey that the ginseng fruit is not easily obtained.\n\nOnly upon reaching the rocky cliffs of Putuo and meeting Guanyin Bodhisattva did they recognize the subtle and imperceptible as the highest grade, the true flavor of Shaolin. Seeing that even the bear spirit had the affinity to attain the true fruit, how could the Tang Monk lack the means to save the spiritual root? Zhenyuan’s spiritual root was opened by Heaven; the sweet dew from the pure vase was wrought by the self.\n\nThe poem says:\n*\"To perfect the body of action, one must long practice the truly wondrous Dao.\nThis is indeed the true essence of the entire work.\"*\n\nThe *Diamond Sutra* states:\n*\"If one sees me in form, seeks me in sound, such a one walks the deviant path and cannot see the Tathāgata.\"* For the truly wondrous Dao is profound and difficult to perceive, lying entirely in the heart’s inward reflection and tranquil observation. To cling even slightly to sound or form is to depart from the formless, odorless original substance—such a one walks the deviant path and is cut off from the Tathāgata.\n\nIt further says:\n*\"All conditioned dharmas are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows, like dew, like lightning—contemplate them thus.\"* Some interpreters say that all conditioned things are illusory, understanding only the fleetingness of a galloping horse’s shadow or a butterfly’s dream, the spark struck from stone or the flower in the mirror—what real benefit is there in this? Those skilled in discourse assign a meaning to every word, never repeating themselves—how much more so the World-Honored One! These four lines are the essential pointer of the entire sutra; how can one reduce them to a single \"emptiness\" and treat \"dreams,\" \"illusions,\" \"bubbles,\" \"shadows,\" \"dew,\" and \"lightning\" as one and the same?\n\nThus, only by grasping the meaning of *\"like dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows\"* can one grasp the mechanism of *\"like dew, like lightning.\"*",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Twenty-Seventh: The Corpse Demon Plays Three Tricks on Tang Sanzang**\n\nThe Saintly Monk, having consumed the *rénshēng* ginseng fruit, now has the *golden elixir* within him. Henceforth, he has shed his mortal form and transformed his bones—his spirit refreshed, his body robust.\n\nYet after attaining the elixir, one must still clarify the mind and perceive true nature, discarding the common mortal form and exchanging it for the refined. If he fails to recognize truth, to see through illusions, if he appears merciful yet slips into indulgence, if he seems wise yet is blinded by cunning deceit, then his virtue may become excessive and invite *róngxié* perversity, his wisdom may falter and risk abandoning the right path!\n\nThus, the Corpse Demon’s three tricks are revealed, and the Saintly Monk’s resentment in driving him away is justified.\n\nThe Corpse Demon is none other than the *qì* shell of those who cultivate the Dao. Originally a malevolent spirit that deludes, it can mislead others unaware. It appears as a youthful beauty, yet is truly hollow white bone; it seems like a tender youth, yet is actually frail and aged; it masquerades as a living *bóshā* (菩萨), yet is in truth *jiūpánchútú* (鸠盘荼); it feigns pity, yet is merely a fool toying with others.\n\nFor the human body harbors three Corpse Demons, which resent one’s attainment of the Dao, and during moments of slumber, they accuse one of transgressions.\n\nThose who seek the Dao, if they cling to form and appearance without first annihilating the three Corpse Demons, will never escape the mortal shell nor ascend to the *Yùjīng* (玉京) of immortality.\n\nThus, those who cling to the body are like guardians of the Corpse Demon, and the Demon’s accusations against them are countless. Those who preserve the body must only focus on eliminating the Demon, for its schemes against them are unfathomable.\n\nHow great is the Demon’s power to bewitch and mislead!\n\nIn this chapter, *\"Sanzang was journeying to the Zōngyá place when hunger struck\"*—just when the Corpse Demon sought to claim him as its meal. The Pilgrim declared, *\"Master, you lack understanding!\"*—meaning he failed to see through the deception.\n\nSanzang, drowning in his own partiality and displeased, took this as a harm wrought by hunger, yet his clouded wisdom was the root of his straying from the right path.\n\nSince Sanzang subdued the Pilgrim at *Liángjiè Shān* (两界山), he has upheld the right and banished the false, combining both wisdom and courage—his deeds truly magnificent.\n\nThe monk also knew the Pilgrim could not be separated for an instant, so why did he suddenly grow angry at his lingering laziness, forgetting the favor of saving his life at *Liángjiè Shān*, yet acting as if he had done some great deed?\n\nThe author’s meaning is subtle!\n\n*Liángjiè Shān* is the place where right and false stand opposed. Earlier, when the Pilgrim was confined between its towering peaks, it was a test of perceiving true nature and the beginning of his fate. Hence, Sanzang subdued him to establish this foundation.\n\nNow, *\"journeying to the Zōngyá place\"* signifies the boundary of fate and the preservation of true nature—so Sanzang cast him aside as a warning.\n\nTo the Pilgrim, it showed that talent and cleverness are not to be relied upon, nor achievements to be boasted of.\nTo Sanzang, it revealed that *Mìluó*’s (汨罗) lone loyalty must be discerned, while *Huáiyīn*’s (淮阴) superficial merits are easily misjudged.\n\nThe chapter concludes with the Great Sage recounting *\"In Chang’an, there was Liu Bǒqīn who saw me off on my journey, and at Liángjiè Shān, he saved my life\"*—down to the lines *\"When the birds are done, the bow is hidden; when the hare is dead, the dog is cooked\"*—each word dripping with sorrow, causing all ages of heroes to weep in grief.\n\nYet suspicion and mistrust arise from the separation of *yīnrǒu* (阴柔) forces, while banishment often stems from the slanderous tongues of those who speak ill.",

      "translated_text": "Eight Precepts mistook white bones for a fair visage, believing the devourer to be a monk begging alms—thus dragging maggot-tails as fragrant rice and toad-meat as fried gluten. The Three Temptations of the Corpse-Mara were but tricks to blind the eyes. The more one indulged, the more skillful they became, yet in the end, they could never deceive the discerning. The bones remained white.\n\nThe Great Sage’s slaughter was the act of one with keen perception. Yet even after repeated victories, his merit led only to slander and suppression, burying his loyal heart.\n\nThe world’s fickleness and affairs’ reversals are timeless—no cause for astonishment. Only when a brother envies his elder does strife erupt within the household walls, while a master’s disdain for his disciple sparks sudden rejection between teacher and student. When wood rots, worms infest; when suspicion arises, slander spreads. All stems from failing to turn away from evil or to uphold the good.\n\nThe *Qiaoyao Song* states:\n*\"To grasp fate’s command, to lose ancestral nature—\nLike a mirror without gems to hold one’s face.\nA life as vast as heaven and earth, yet a fool’s grasp,\nHolding wealth like a masterless pawn.\"*\n\nThus, one who embodies the innate luminosity without deceit is truly established in the Dao, achieving the utmost of effortless action.\n\nIn days past, Bodhidharma sat nine years facing the wall, penetrating truth through meditation, before returning to the West with but a single sandal—mastering the wondrous Dao of cultivating both life and nature. Beginning with the physical form, ending with its shedding.\n\nOne does not gaze upon white bones as if they were a fair visage, but as white bones; nor does one gaze upon white bones as white bones, but as a fair visage. Thus, one attains clarity.\n\nThere is a method of observing white bones, though it belongs to lesser teachings, yet worthy of note. Imagine the left big toe rotting, oozing foul fluid, gradually spreading to the calf, then the knee, then the waist—so too the right. Gradually, the rot spreads past the waist, to the abdomen, the chest, and finally the neck, until nothing remains but white bones. Observe them clearly, one by one, until, after long contemplation, you ask: *Who is it that observes these bones?* Then you realize the body is always separate from oneself.\n\nNext, observe the bones from a distance—first one *zhang*, then five, ten, a hundred, thousands—until you see that these bones have nothing to do with you. If you dwell on this reflection, you will know that the self and the physical form are two distinct things. The self temporarily resides within the form—why cling to it forever, dwelling within it?\n\nThus, one may equalize birth and death, achieving a profound insight into shedding the shell and transcending the world.\n\nThe *\"husband\"* in this passage refers to one who shares the same journey and fate as me—not a spouse in the conventional sense. If mistaken as such, it remains one layer removed, not the immediate Corpse-Mara.\n\nAt first, the illusion took the form of a beautiful woman, with moon-like features and flower-like grace. Though clearly a demon, the Elder did not recognize it. With sweet words, it offered *\"this meal to the monk.\"* Eight Precepts nearly succumbed—his nature driven by food and desire, yet unable to take its form.\n\nWhen the Pilgrim returned and saw through the deception, he struck it down at once, crushing the false corpse beneath his palm. In an instant, maggots writhed and toads leapt. Was desire truly his nature? Or was it not?\n\nThen the illusion took the form of an old woman.",

For **Wood** cannot cut **Wood**, nor can **Earth** overcome **Earth**; what was already suppressed must rely on the **justice of the Golden Spirit**. Even the **Wood Spirit** like Eight Rules and the **Earth Spirit** like Sha Monk are but one-sided forces, unable yet to triumph decisively.

Five Relationships lack **truth**, they collapse;\nwhen the hundred virtues lack **truth**, they perish.\nThus, when ruler and subject share the same **virtue**, governance flourishes,\nand when husband and wife align their hearts, progeny thrive.\nYet if superiors and inferiors deceive one another,\nand inner and outer circles resort to deceit,\nthere has never been one who did not meet ruin—\nbody lost, family destroyed, nation fallen.\n\n**\"Truth\"** is the word of a person,\nspringing from the heart and governed by the mouth.\nWhen words do not come from sincerity, they become **deceitful speech**;\nwhen falsehoods flow from the lips, they become **long-tongued slander**.\nDeceitful speech confuses the ears,\nwhile slanderous tongues topple cities.\nBecause of **embroidered tigers** woven from lies,\nQu Yuan drowned himself in loyal grief,\nand because of jealous slander,\nBai Qi died on a peak of filial betrayal.\n\nTo invert right and wrong,\na deer may be called a horse;\nto confuse true and false,\na boar may be mistaken for a pig.\nEven the golden cicada transforms into a ferocious beast,\nand boundless affection turns into a blade of cruelty—\nall are harms wrought by the **tongue-demon**.\n\nThat the **Three Treasures** turned into a tiger—\nwhat is there to find strange in that?\nYet the old demon, recognizing kin,\nfirst used the pretense of hunting tigers as a means,\nhis words skillfully planted.\n\nIn general, deceitful men advance their schemes\nby first feigning intimacy;\nonce intimacy is feigned, flattering words find easy purchase,\nthen they seek to establish merit;\nthrough merit, favor is secured.\nThus, smooth-tongued flattery ensnares the golden-headed monk in an iron cage,\nwhile sharp-tongued venom devours the green-faced demon in song and dance.\nWhen such words arise,\nwho does not weep in sorrow?\nOnce a horse’s servant,\nhow could one not bow in submission?\nThe Small Dragon manifested from his body,\nbowing to save the master—\nsuccess or failure, profit or loss,\nwere not his concern.\n\nLoyal ministers and righteous warriors\nshould be stirred to action by this.\nThe Wood Mother’s grief drew him forward,\nthe Golden Official’s urgency brought him back—\nscattered, then reunited;\nobscured, then clarified.\nCould this not be the work of a single sincere thought,\npenetrating near and far?\n\nMarvelous indeed!\nThe Small Dragon twisted in flattery,\nsinging and dancing to his desires.\nWith a sideways glance, he seized the moment—\nfive flowers, eight gates—\nstriking when defenses were low.\nWhat difference was there\nbetween the dagger of the **Poisoned Arrow** or the hammer of the **Surfing Wave**?\nThough the deed was not yet complete,\nit was enough to stir the heart.\n\nYet when the **full-court flush** struck the dust,\nhe barely escaped with his life by the river’s waters.\nCrouched in endurance, his few companions wailed in grief.\nAs the poem says:\n*\"The horse and ape scattered, the golden and wooden withered,\nthe Yellow Wife parted ways, and **Dao** and righteousness grew thin.\"*\nTruly, a cause for lament.\n\nEight Rules suddenly awoke from his dream,\nhearing the white horse speak with human words.\nRecalling the White Tiger Ridge and the White-Boned Lady’s tale,\nhe knew the tiger’s transformation stemmed from the white bones,\nand the yellow robe arose from the white bones.\nFrom constraint came regret,\nfrom regret came enlightenment—\nthe very mechanism to turn peril into safety.\n\nThe Small Dragon spoke:\n*\"He is a monkey king of **ren** and **yi**,\nwho will surely seize the demon and save the master.\"*\nThis was the appearance of a true person,\nwhile the demon’s evil faded—\nthe strategy of **End Wood** and **Pure Source**.\n\nWith tears dripping from his mouth,\nhis words were earnest and sincere—\nhow could Eight Rules not devote himself wholeheartedly?\n\nEight Rules saw the **Pilgrim**,\nthen slunk away toward the grassy cliff,\n*\"sliding and dodging\"*—\nthe utmost in shame and reluctance.\n\nThe **Pilgrim** saw Eight Rules,\ntook his hand and led him to the Water Curtain Cave to play,\ndemonstrating his lingering affection for seclusion.\nYet because Eight Rules did not speak truly\nbut instead feigned sincerity,\nthe **Pilgrim** also pretended reluctance\nand withdrew to the groves.\n\nEight Rules departed—\nwas he truly gone?\nHe feigned separation to deliver later words;\nthe **Pilgrim** did not go—\nwas he truly unwilling?\nHe lingered to demand true sincerity.\n\nEight Rules, after parting, turned back to curse,\nhis anger driving him to pursue;\nthe **Pilgrim**, though not leaving, secretly followed,\nprobing the truth to ensure he did not depart.\nBoth harbored hidden schemes,\nyet neither forgot the master.\n\nNow that the **Pilgrim** had obtained true sincerity,\nhow could he not reveal his true heart!\n\n---\n**Chapter 31: Eight Rules Rouses the Monkey King with Righteousness**\n**The Pilgrim Subdues the Demon with Wisdom**\n\nThe sage **Treasured One** said:\nIn **Pali**, *\"Shakyamuni\"* is the same as the Chinese *\"Neng Ren\"*—\n**\"Ren\"** governs life, **\"Yi\"** governs killing.\nKilling to protect life,\nkilling is thus life.\nTo be able to give life but unable to kill—\nthat is not **true compassion**.\n\nThe **Pilgrim**’s killing of the White Bones was **Yi**,\nand truly **Ren**.\nEight Rules deemed it un-**Yi**,\nthe **Master** deemed it un-**Ren**,\nand thus suffered unjust demotion.\nThis is called **\"internal Ren, external Yi\"**\n—not knowing that **Yi** is **Ren**.\n\nEight Rules, moved by the Dragon Horse’s earnest admonition,\nregretted extinguishing the White Bones,\nand knelt to beg the **Pilgrim** to rescue him from his peril—\nthis was to release **Ren** with **Yi**,\nrestoring him to his post as **Grand Councilor**,\nand granting him authority over life and death.\n\nThus the Small Dragon said:\n*\"He is a monkey king of **ren** and **yi**,\nwho will surely seize the demon and save the master.\"*\nIn terms of **Ren** and **Yi**, this was the operation of the **Great Dao**;\nin terms of **Metal** and **Wood**, this was the marvel of **elixir alchemy**—\none **yin**, one **yang**,\none husband, one wife,\ntheir inversion and union never to be separated.\n\n**Metal** is **Yi**,\n**Wood** is **Ren**.\nWood clings to Metal in obedience to **Yi**,\nMetal cherishes Wood in practice of **Ren**.\nMutually beneficial, they achieve the **True Fruit**.\nRooted in **One Nature**,\npaired with the **Original Spirit**—\nthough called brothers,\nthey share the same **qi**;\nthough called demons,\nthey partake of the Five Phases.\nIf one could sever worldly attachments\nand return to the origin,\nthen **Great Awakening** would be attained.\n\nThe opening word of this chapter is most lucid.\nYet the **Dao** of **Ren** and **Yi**\nrelies on **truth** as its foundation.\nTo a person,

      "translated_text": "The Princess reproached the Pilgrim for lacking integrity, while the Pilgrim countered that the Princess acted unfilially. Both examined Daoist principles at their roots: one feared a husband’s power over her, seeking to preserve her own trustworthiness; the other relied on the Princess’s attachment to him to fulfill his integrity. The Princess entrusted her message to him—an act of filial piety—while the Pilgrim subdued the demon to uphold righteousness and complete her filial duty.\n\nRighteousness fulfills trustworthiness, and trustworthiness fulfills righteousness. Emotion and righteousness unite in strategy, while wisdom acts within. Thus, the Princess concealed herself, and the Pilgrim transformed his appearance.\n\nWondrous indeed! *\"The Pilgrim changed into the Princess’s likeness.\"*\n\nGold can overcome water, yet why does it reverse to earth to sweetly endure wood’s dominance? The *Suishu* states: *\"Without deceitful tactics, how could one pacify rebels and break through deceit?\"*—this is how he fulfilled his trust.\n\nLaozi says: *\"The tongue is soft, the teeth hard. The teeth are hard, so they break. The tongue endures without wear because it is soft.\"* Softness thus accomplishes hardness.\n\nSunzi says: *\"To take what you desire, you must first give it.\"* Giving is precisely how you take it.\n\nThe Pilgrim’s transformation as the Princess—trustworthy yet employing deceit, hard yet yielding softness—embodied the subtle Dao of giving to take. Like a cat dragging a mouse, he wailed pitifully, feigning mercy, mimicking a woman’s heartbreak at parting. Or like a hedgehog in a tiger’s mouth, he acted meekly, hiding his thorns, portraying a husband’s cruelty toward his child, bewitching others with seductive wiles.\n\nHe disrupted marriages while pretending to uphold them; he killed children while weeping for them; he stole treasures while devouring them. All was won through wisdom, not by outward appearances.\n\nWhen the Pilgrim revealed his true form, he transformed into three heads and six arms—changing three oddities into six pairs, restoring the cosmos, aligning Heaven and Earth so all things flourished. This mirrored the *Bua* hexagram’s reversal into *Fu*, the symbol of renewal.\n\nThus, in the following chapter: *\"Tang Seng regained the Monkey King, and they proceeded westward, encountering once more the season of spring.\"*\n\nThe Great Sage drove away the subterranean demon and uncovered the celestial constellation of Kui. The Jade Emperor dispatched his officials to subdue it, and the Princess of the Treasure Elephant’s origins were revealed. In an instant, she was returned to her homeland, where her parents reunited, fulfilling her wish to send the message and Tang Seng’s duty to deliver it. Earlier, through flattery, the water-spraying mouth lost its nature and altered its form; now, with true incantations, the demon’s qi retreated, and its original body was restored. No longer was there the confusion of the White-Bone Lady.\n\nFor evil and righteousness diverge, yet the conflict hinges on a single thought. True and false intermingle in enlightenment, ultimately sharing the same source. The Princess’s sincere trust led her from falsehood to truth, exhausting the path.\n\nIf one mistakenly takes falsehood for truth, then the demon is not the Sage—even if elixirs are swallowed, it remains like releasing a stolen heart. How could one fail to discern this?\n\nThe Great Sage returned to the Three Treasures, though as a disciple returning to his master, it was as if his heart reunited with his body, or a ruler restored to his kingdom—*\"When the heart is upright, all is upright; when the ruler is virtuous, all are virtuous.\"*\n\nThus, the concluding words: *\"The king returns to the treasure hall to stabilize the realm, the monk proceeds to the Thunderclap Peak to seek the Buddha.\"*\n\nFrom the twenty-eighth chapter to this point, it is clear that after obtaining the elixir, one must still awaken to nature and clarify the heart. From striving to rest, from labor to ease, gradually reaching the state of *wuwei* and transformation. The meaning will be clear in the subsequent chapters’ dialogues between master and disciples.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two: The Official of Pingding Mountain Delivers the Message, the Wood Mother of the Lotus Cave Meets Disaster**\n\nA disciple of enlightenment said: If one understands the profound meaning of the six characters *\"Pingding Mountain, Lotus Cave,\"* then the following three chapters—where mountains press down, elixirs are refined, and illusions of Heaven and Earth are fabricated—along with the four chapters involving the As-You-Wish Jewel and the Golden Snare binding Sun Wukong, the gourd containing the Pilgrim, the female Nuwa mending the sky with stone, the banana fan’s true fire, and the bottle containing Sun Wukong—all their mysteries will be revealed.\n\nAs for the mountain, why is it called *Pingding*? At the beginning of the chapter, it states: *\"The master and disciples were of one heart and body, all heading toward the Western Land.\"* West refers to the *Xie* (兑) position.\n\n*Xie* is the hexagram of the maiden, depicted as (☵☰☵), three lines: one yin above, two yang below—two metals and one earth.\n\nThe three lines of *Kun* (☷) form *Xie*; *Xie* is the maiden, the upper line of *Kun* (☷☵).\n\nCollectively, the six lines of *Kun* represent six hundred *li*. Below *Xie* is (☰☰), two yang lines—belonging to *Qian* (☰), metal—symbolizing the Golden Angle and Silver Angle, representing mountains. When the earth star is level, the metal star forms angles, likening mountains.\n\nThe Buddha said: *\"I have a treasure hidden in the Form Mountain. Do you all recognize it?\"* Master Yuanjue Chan said: *\"At the top of the head, shining brightly—this is the Dao without Dao, called the true Dao.\"* This is like the pearl within the oyster, the profound meaning of Pingding Mountain.\n\n*\"Within it is a cave named Lotus.\"* Flowers are the manifestation of yang qi. The lotus blooms when yin follows the peak of yang, as in the *\"Awakening to Reality\"* passage: *\"Next, the red flower emerges, followed by yin.\"* And *\"The maiden’s flower first blooms in the northern land.\"*\n\nSince *Xie* is the maiden, she internally nurtures the golden lotus, embodying the Five Treasures, capable of transforming treasures into demons or demons into treasures. Those refining the elixir believe demons possess treasures; by activating their spiritual mechanisms, they can steal the Purple-Gold Gourd. Ultimately, the gourd still belongs to Sun, as demons are transformed into elixir through demonic illusions.",

      "translated_text": "Sun Wukong’s heart now understood those words and penetrated their true meaning.\n\nThe *\"Jade-Gold Red Gourd\"* symbolizes the **Li** fire—flaming upward, externally yang yet internally yin. Its fiery nature like a gourd, red in hue, embodies the **Wǔgōng** (Three-legged Crow) and the sun’s essence. The *\"Mutton-Fat White Jade Flask\"* symbolizes the **Kǎn** water—gentle and moist, externally yin yet internally yang. Its smoothness like jade, white in color, is the **Yùtù** (Jade Rabbit) and the moon’s purity. The *\"Seven-Star Blade\"* symbolizes the **Jiǎn** (Mountain) and **Duì** (Lake) meeting in metal, the nature of earth and water converging in breath. The *\"Banana Leaf Fan\"* symbolizes the **Zhen** (Thunder) wood and **Xùn** (Wind) wind, the clash of wind and thunder. The *\"Shaking Golden Lasso\"* symbolizes the **Qián** (Heaven, firm) and **Kūn** (Earth, yielding)—the two *qi* intertwining, long and short as they will, swaying uncertainly, the very essence of the central land. In form, it encompasses the eight trigrams; in substance, it belongs to the five elements. The mother and child demons each hold one treasure, each embodying its nature, hence their monstrous forms.\n\nThe lesser demon, lost in delusion, attempts to usurp heaven, thus losing control of its elemental essence. The blame lies with the celestial assembly for deceiving with falsehoods, unaware of recognizing falsehood as truth. Their error stems from their own missteps—still groping blindly beneath the earth after their failed attempt to usurp heaven, unwilling to abandon the false, fearing the easy loss of truth while clinging to the false.\n\nThe Pilgrim transformed into a fly, and the Buddha’s *intention-jewel* also changed with him—this is the true principle. **Kǎn** and **Li**, the roots of creation, give birth to all things; their movement is inevitable. In the demon’s body, they are demonic treasures; in the Buddha’s, they are Buddhist treasures. Even a fly’s body can contain them—how could this be mere empty talk?\n\nThe two demons misused **Kǎn** and **Li**, losing their true nature. In anger at the false pretenses of the celestial deceivers, they sought to exploit the *intention-nature* by force, compelling the primordial *qi*. Thus, they begged the Old Mother to obtain the *Shaking Golden Lasso*.\n\nThe *lasso* is two strands intertwined, never unified. *Shaking* signifies doubt and confusion in the mind, without certainty. The nine-tailed fox holds it, for foxes are prone to suspicion; nine tails symbolize chaos. The *Chāibā Mountain Tiger* and *Yǐhǎi Dragon* display their mistaken grasp of dragons and tigers, boasting of their supposed prowess in subduing beasts.\n\nThe Pilgrim secretly observed their foundation, striking down their strength and transforming their doubt—what is taken for truth may still be false, while what is false may yet be true. Knowing falsehood as false makes it true.\n\nThe Pilgrim took the guise of an old nurse entering the cave, and Eight Rules mocked him for exposing his tail, revealing the truth hidden within falsehood—something that cannot be entirely erased. The demon king sought to offer Tang Sanzang’s flesh for longevity, while the Pilgrim demanded to cut off Eight Rules’ earlobes for wine, exposing the urgency of discarding falsehood within falsehood. Both ears must listen keenly.\n\nThe True Person’s teachings are not idle; they are not mere objects of ridicule or jest. The Dao of the Primordial does not cling to form or sensation, nor does it fall into perception and hearing. Round and radiant, it bears no trace—neither thread nor particle.\n\nThe Pilgrim had no choice but to manifest and disperse, transforming into a crimson glow filling the cave—*gathered, it forms shape; dispersed, it becomes qi*.\n\nAs the *Vajra Unveiling* states:\n*\"If one seeks me through form, or calls me through sound,\nThat person walks the wrong path and cannot see the Tathāgata.\"*\n\nThus, those ensnared by form and sound remain prey to the tiger’s jaws, while those trapped by names and appearances are but hollow reeds.\n\nWhen the Pilgrim used the golden lasso to snare the demon king, it became the demon’s own lasso binding its body—how could it escape its own trap? When the demon king used the lasso to snare the Monkey, it was demon confronting demon—how could it harm the Monkey’s slightest hair?\n\nThe two demons used the gourd to deceive the Pilgrim, calling him by name—this was seeking the Buddha through sound. Why not answer with false names to their delusion? The Pilgrim, in turn, called the demons from within the gourd—also using sound to deceive them, yet transforming falsehood into truth.\n\nTo break the golden lasso, a few strokes with a steel file suffice—wisdom manifests, and knowledge dissolves. To escape the gourd, a few shouts are enough—the physical form vanishes, and compassion pervades universally.\n\nThe golden noose tightens around the neck; the light behind it is still an illusion, yet liberation is still needed. The gourd’s darkness hides a treasure yet unrefined—urgent enlightenment is required.\n\nDo not say the gourd belongs to its master by clever artifice—\nBetter to borrow hands to achieve what comes naturally.\nIn an instant, it rises—*that is me.*\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Granted your schemes are cunning in a thousand ways,\nYet the gourd still bears the surname Sun.\"*\n\nSun Wukong—Wukong Sun. Forward and backward, inverted, all belong to the surname Sun.\nAh! From *\"surname Sun\"* one awakens to the mystery of sons and grandsons.\n\nTaking **Kǎn** to fill **Li**, returning to the exposed primal *qi*—*\"Catch a breath, and you’re off, disguised.\"*\n\nFools mistakenly guess this as the art of the bedroom.\n\n---\n**Chapter 35: External Paths Display Power to Deceive True Nature**\n**The Monkey King Steals Heaven’s Treasure and Subdues the Demon**\n\nA disciple of enlightenment says: The two young demons stole heaven’s treasures and became demons, turning the five treasures into five thieves. Sun the Great Sage stole heaven’s treasures and subdued the demons, turning the five thieves into five treasures.\n\nThe same heavenly treasures, the same act of theft—yet righteousness and evil are utterly distinct, depending solely on whether one cultivates or does not cultivate.\n\nGold, wood, water, fire, and earth—these are heaven’s treasures, and they are also humanity’s treasures. Heaven’s nature is humanity’s nature. If one exploits their nature one-sidedly, they mutually deceive and suppress each other: fire sees water as a thief, water sees earth as a thief, earth sees wood as a thief, wood sees metal as a thief, and metal sees fire’s force as a thief.",

      "translated_text": "Each thief is a thief to its own nature, each nature is its own nature—yet they lose their true essence. When their natures are harmonized, they mutually generate: metal generates water, and the true yang within water can generate the yin of metal, while the yin of metal in turn can generate the yang of wood, and thus metal and wood intertwine as treasures.\n\nWood generates fire, and the true yin within fire can generate the yang of wood, while the yang of wood in turn can generate the yin of water, and thus wood and fire are both at their fullest as treasures.\n\nThey intermingle as parent and child, alternating as husband and wife, and together they attain their treasures. This is what is called \"concentrating the five phases,\" reversing cultivation and transformation—just as **Nüwa** refined the five-colored stones to patch the sky.\n\nThe five-colored stones are earth. The method of cultivation relies entirely on the essence of earth. Earth has no fixed position, yet it governs the four seasons and embodies the central palace;\n\nFire, through it, does not flare,\nWater, through it, does not overflow,\nMetal, through it, endures long,\nWood, through it, does not wither.\n\nThus, *The Awakening to Reality* says: *\"The five phases and four symbols rely entirely on earth.\"*\n\nMetal, wood, water, and fire reside at the four corners,\nAnd when viewed through earth, they are **external Dao**;\nEarth dwells in the central palace,\nAnd when viewed through metal, wood, water, and fire, it is **heart-monkey**.\n\nThose who practice **external Dao** wield power\nAre one-sided in their exploitation of nature,\nNot the true method of **gold elixir**,\nHence they deceive the true essence.\n\nThose who attain treasures with **heart-monkey**\nCollect and harvest their treasures,\nObtain the true Dao of **gold elixir**,\nHence they subdue the evil demons.\n\nTwo key phrases, most clearly stated.\n\nReaders who rigidly insist that **heart-monkey** is the human mind,\nOr shallowly perceive **external Dao** as mere evil demons,\nFail to grasp their meaning.\n\nThe opening poem states: *\"One’s original nature is round and bright, the Dao naturally flows through.\"*\nA single phrase revealing the entire truth.\n\nIt further says:\n*\"Pure and turbid, how many times they turn with fate,\nThe eternal and the void, let them wander east and west.\"*\nIllustrating the five phases’ cyclical transformations and the marvel of generation.\n\nThus it is said: *\"This aligns with the Great Sage Sun’s profound Dao.\"*\n\nThe Great Sage Sun is also called **\"Xingzhe Sun\"**,\nWith a name that is ever-shifting—up, down, left, right,\nInverted without end—yet encompassing all phases.\n\nHe is the **central palace’s yang**,\nFor the Dao’s body is indeed such.\n\nThe **golden rope** of the previous section is also earth,\nYet it is vague and formless,\nWhile the Great Sage Sun obtained its **pure steel’s true gold**.\n\nBecause of this true treasure,\nHe entered the gourd without dissolving,\nFor earth can quench flames;\n\nBecause of this true treasure,\nHe then obtained the gourd itself,\nFor fire meets earth and returns to its form;\n\nBecause of this true treasure,\nHe acquired the **jade purity bottle**,\nFor water sees earth and unifies in chaos;\n\nBecause of this true treasure,\nHe gained the

**fire potency** [火候].\n\nOn the **twenty-third day**, **Qian** generates **two yin**,\nThe **Gen** [艮] Trigram—**one yang line above, two yin lines below** [上一阳爻，下二阴爻],\nThe **rear crescent** [后弦],\nThe **medicine and substance** [药物],\nThe **yin** [阴],\nThe **two eights** [二八].\n\nThe *Cántóng* [参同] states:\n*\"Kàn-Lí* [坎离] are the **two functions of Qian and Kun** [乾坤二用].\nTwo without

**true utterance of the Moon’s brilliance** [月明之真言].\nWhen insight is fully awakened, it is as if **taking the scriptures from the Western Heaven** [西天取经].\n\nThe **Sand Monk** further points

[三日月出庚] in *Cántóng*,\nAnd the **true scripture of this very chapter** [本书本回真经].\nIt also indicates that after the **Moon’s fullness** [月圆],\nOne must fulfill **three thousand functions** [功满三千] to comply with **Heaven’s edict** [应天诏].\n\nEach disciple expounds upon the **essential nature of cultivation** [本质阐发修炼玄机],\nAnd thus the **entire oral transmission of the Golden Elixir** [金丹始终口诀] is

yin** [虚阴]—\n**one yang line above and below, one yin line in the center** [上下各一阳爻，中一阴爻]—\nMust be filled by the **true yang of Kàn** [坎中之真阳],\nOnly then is the **complete Qian essence** [乾体之真] restored.\n\nIf one **mistakes the false forms of the body’s heart and kidney** [一身心肾之假象],\nAnd **clings to internal water-fire exchange as truth** [执水火内交为真],\nThis is **erroneously grasping the meaning of *\"acquiring a companion in the southwest\"** [西南得朋之义].\n\nIt is like the **true-west king** [正西国王],\nWho **pledges brotherhood with the complete truth from Zhōunán Mountain** [结拜锺南山祈雨之全真],\nSharing bed and board,\n**Seizing the true as false** [假夺其真],\nWhile the **true is lost** [真者反陷].\n\n**Kàn** [坎] is, in Pre-Heaven, the **true west** [本正西];\n**Lí** [离] is, in

[上下二爻] represent the **eight angles of the four directions** [八角四方],\nClear as **jade-like glass** [透如琉璃],\nHence it is said:\n*\"Eight-cornered glass well\"* [八角琉璃井边].\n*\"Suddenly, ten thousand rays

How wondrous this is!\n\nThe commentator says: *\"The tortoise bearing the bowl,*\n*along with the later episodes of the lotus petals crossing the sea,*\n*the Dragon Princess plucking hairs—*\n*all these exchanges, leisurely unfolded,*\n*seem unrelated to the main text,*\n*merely serving as a foil to the Red Boy.\"*\n\n*\"Like the painter’s words:*\n*'‘Fine grasses and fallen flowers make a brocade land,’*\n*these fallen flowers are but embellishments*\n*to adorn the fine grasses,*\n*thus completing the brocade.\"*\n\n*Yet this passage reveals the Immortal Master’s*\n*application of profound truth,*\n*crafting a marvelous form—*\n*truly the core of the main text.*\n\n*His imaginings and strokes*\n*possess a divine, ghostly artistry,*\n*beyond mortal reach.*\n*Among a hundred chapters,*\n*this stands as peerless masterwork!*\n\n*Laozi teaches:*\n*\"Through kindness, one attains courage;\nThrough frugality, one attains breadth;\nBy not daring to lead the world,*\n*one achieves enduring greatness.\"*\n\n*In ancient times,*\n*the Duke of Zhou and King Wu,*\n*in their wrath, settled the land;*\n*Confucius, in his wrath,*\n*rectified the four cardinal directions—*\n*great courage indeed.*\n\n*Yet only through great kindness*\n*could such great courage arise.*\n*The demon’s guise as a false Bodhisattva,*\n*deceptive yet plausible,*\n*confuses truth with falsehood—*\n*the foremost trick of evil spirits,*\n*most destructive in its harm.*\n\n*The Bodhisattva, in great kindness,*\n*thus raged:*\n*\"That wretch dares mimic my form!\"*\n*\"With a sweep of my gem-studded alms-bowl,*\n*I cast it into the sea’s depths!\"*\n*Clear in vision, resolute in deed—*\n*this is “Through kindness, one attains courage.”*\n\n*The *Huainanzi* states:*\n*\"There is essence yet it is not used,*\n*there is spirit yet it is not employed.*\n*In harmony with the Great Primordial Purity,*\n*one stands within the realm of utmost clarity.\"*\n*This is the Way of frugality.*\n\n*\"‘Always an empty bowl,*\n*cast into the sea,*\n*now it holds all its waters within—*\n*you cannot lift it.’\"*\n*The empty bowl is the epitome of frugality,*\n*and only through such frugality*\n*does one attain boundless breadth,*\n*as in the saying:*\n*\"‘A sesame seed can contain Mount Sumeru,*\n*a hair can swallow the great ocean.’\"*\n*This is “Through frugality, one attains breadth.”*\n\n*The *Book of Documents* says:*\n*\"One must have capacity,*\n*then virtue grows great;*\n*one must endure,*\n*then salvation is achieved.\"*\n*This speaks of vast Qi/breath,*\n*encompassing all with serene cultivation.*\n\n*Among the myriad creatures,*\n*the tortoise is the longest-lived,*\n*taken as a symbol of guarding the female*\n*and nurturing with wisdom.*\n*The sage composed the *I Ching*’s *Yi Hexagram*,*\n*its first line modeled on the tortoise,*\n*to show how the virtuous one*\n*cultivates themselves.*\n\n*\"‘Seeing the waves churn,*\n*a tortoise emerges,*\n*bearing the alms-bowl to the cliffs,’*\n*it carries its burden with ease,*\n*lifting what others cannot—*\n*is this not*\n*'By not daring to lead the world,*\n*one achieves enduring greatness’?\"*\n\n*This contrasts sharply*\n*with the Red Boy’s reckless triumph,*\n*void of cultivation.*\n\n*The Pilgrim bowed in reverence:*\n*\"This disciple does not know.\"*\n*I too bowed in reverence:*\n*\"This disciple does not know.\"*\n*Will those who read this book in ages to come,*\n*and grasp my meaning,*\n*also bow and say*\n*\"‘This disciple does not know’?\"*\n\n*\"The Bodhisattva’s right hand lifts the bowl,*\n*resting it on his left palm—*\n*flowing effortlessly,*\n*a display of mastery,*\n*the third *Dhyāna* of perfect stillness.\"*\n\n*Yet how does the water arise,*\n*if the bowl holds the sea*\n*and the tortoise dives beneath?*\n*Unknown to the common eye,*\n*the bowl’s contents are not mere water,*\n*but the very Qi of the ocean—*\n*formless, untouched by substance.*\n*Thus the Bodhisattva declares:*\n*\"‘My bowl holds sweet dew,*\n*not like the Dragon King’s spray,*\n*which can extinguish that demon’s*\n*threefold *Dhyāna* flame.’\"*\n\n*With the true water of *Dhyāna*,*\n*he subdues the false fire of *Dhyāna*—*\n*using spirit, not mere form,*\n*exemplifying the art of perfect cultivation.*\n*What need then for the mind’s wild flames?*\n\n*When the mind is unrestrained,*\n*it seeks dominance,*\n*burning fiercely like wildfire;*\n*when the mind is still and true,*\n*it guards the female,*\n*nurturing like sweet dew.*\n\n*The wildfire*\n*is the demon’s torment,*\n*consuming the heart;*\n*the sweet dew*\n*is the elixir,*\n*irrigating the soul.*\n*The tortoise is indeed the Red Boy’s*\n*tailored antidote.*\n\n*As for the alms-bowl,*\n*it cradles true Qi,*\n*vast and tranquil,*\n*not merely empty and detached—*\n*this is the Dao of*\n*\"non-action yet transformation,*\n*stillness yet creation.\"*\n\n*Should one harbor*\n*a hint of grasping or attachment,*\n*they could never fathom its depths.*\n*Thus the Bodhisattva again*\n*illustrates the Dragon Princess’s*\n*and the precious bowl’s reluctance to part,*\n*showing that such treasures*\n*are not easily obtained.*\n\n*It is not the Bodhisattva who is hard to part from,*\n*but the Pilgrim’s own*\n*indulgence and stinginess*\n*that make the Bodhisattva’s gifts difficult.*\n*Hence, the tight-skin cauldron’s removal,*\n*and the Bodhisattva’s words:*\n*\"‘You are at ease.’\"*\n*To let go is not to abandon,*\n*but to transcend.*\n\n*The Pilgrim plucking hairs,*\n*fearing it might save his life,*\n*the Bodhisattva says:*\n*\"‘Not a hair shall you pluck,*\n*for even my treasure, Shàncái,*\n*I cannot part with.’\"*\n*Stinginess thus makes parting hard.*\n\n*Wealth and desire*\n*are external temptations,*\n*while Shàncái is the true nature’s*\n*wondrous manifestation.*\n*The Bodhisattva reveals:*\n*Shàncái’s reluctance to part,*\n*showing how one sees goodness*\n*in wealth,*\n*divines its use,*\n*discerns the difficulty of letting go,*\n*and awakens to the act of release itself.*\n\n*This is where the Master*\n*blends truth with metaphor,*\n*logic with divine inspiration—*\n*a realm akin to*\n*\"the Heavenly Maiden scattering flowers,\"*\n*not to be read lightly.*\n\n*Emerging from filth yet pure,*\n*the lotus stands alone,*\n*thus its petals can serve as*\n*the universal vessel of compassion,*\n*blown by the breath of Dao,*\n*dispelling all afflictions,*\n*what fear of the boundless sea of suffering?*\n\n*To even the emotions*\n*and achieve harmony,*\n*one must endure.*\n*Thus the *Gāng* blade can form*\n*the Bodhisattva’s seat of Dharma,*\n*as he sits serene,*\n*clouds gathering around,*\n*unfazed by even the mightiest trials.*\n\n*The Dragon Princess splits the lotus,*\n*ascending to the other shore,*\n*while Huì’àn leans on the cosmic *Gāng*’s power,*\n*transforming into a lotus platform—*\n*both reveal the clarity of true nature.*\n\n*The Bodhisattva overturns the alms-bowl,*\n*pours the water like thunder;*\n*extends the willow branch,*\n*turns the blade into a hook.*\n*The reader may think:*\n*\"‘The water poured to quench the fire,*\n*a preemptive strike;*\n*the lotus seat to ensnare the blade,*\n*a victory without battle—*\n*the utmost of goodness.’\"*",

Black Waters Dragon is again raised,\nto show that without cultivating the heart to nourish one’s nature,\none cannot serve the Heavenly Dao—\nthus incurring the Heavenly Tribunals’ punishment.\n\nMao Kang gathered troops to avenge wrongs,\nand in one battle, the dragon was captured—\nthe Tripitaka Master and Eight Rules were freed,\nand the dragon was spared execution,\n*\"for the sake of my noble father’s face,\"*\nand sent westward.\n\nThough the dragon’s accomplices were pardoned out of leniency,\nthis was truly inviting Heaven’s favor.\n\nThe heart governs the Six Desires,\nand among them, the Black Waters Dragon’s desire is most difficult to restrain.\n\nThe immortal master composed another passage,\nusing veiled speech and allegory,\nhighlighting its core essence—\nto awaken clarity of nature and purity of heart,\nsubtly contrasting with the Black Waters Dragon and its journey through the Underworld.\nThe passage merely points to its ambiguous heart,\nand uses symbols to convey its meaning—\nits intent is profound.\n\n*\"The River God summoned the art of obstructing the waters,\nblocking the upper current.\nSoon, the lower flow dried up,\nand a great path opened.\"*\n\nThis is the method of uprooting and sealing the source,\nforcing the waters against their nature\nand preventing the lower flow—\ntruly the key to cultivating nature and attaining immortality.\n\nThe great path westward was revealed,\nRed Boy was bound while the Black Crocodile returned,\nand the Three Mysteries of pure cultivation were attained.\n\nYet why does the text say that whenever demons and monsters capture the Tripitaka Master,\nthey claim:\n*\"The Golden Cicada reincarnation,\na body of true yang refined over ten lifetimes—\nif someone eats even a piece of his flesh,\nit will extend their lifespan and grant eternal youth\"*?\n\nBecause this text is written specifically for the Dao of Gold Elixir.\nThose demons and monsters symbolize those who practice perverse, heretical methods,\nhoping vainly for longevity—\nthey are likened to refining gold elixir into a tangible, substantial form,\nhence the *\"Golden Cicada reincarnation\"*;\nthe *\"true yang of the primordial body refined over ten lifetimes\"*;\nand the *\"eating his flesh grants eternal youth\"*.\n\nThey do not know that the Elixir of Rebirth is originally formless,\nunlike the Tripitaka Master’s blood and flesh—\nthis is why they are considered heretical demons.\n\nIt boasts of its name, *\"Mountain Until the Black River,\"*\nspanning tens of thousands of words,\na vast and profound discourse,\nexpounding the mysteries of the Dao,\nall rooted in the benevolent cultivation of the heart\nby Master Zhuang.\n\nSome say this text belongs to the lineage of Zhong and Lü,\nbut they do not know it traces directly back to Mencius’ Dao.\n\nThe discerning may judge accordingly.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Four: The Law Body and Primordial Fate Encounter the Ox-Cart’s Power**\n**The Rectified Heart Overcomes the Heretical Demons at the Ridge Pass**\n\nA scholar said: These three passages are specifically written to refute external Daoist sects.\n\nExternal sects, like those seeking entry through side doors and alleys,\ntwisting and turning, devious and unorthodox,\nare rarely able to attain true fruition—\nwhy?\n\nFor those who advance at the proper time,\ntheir foundation must align with the Heavenly Dao’s path.\nExternal sects, however, are like galloping recklessly along walls and byways,\nnever finding their true path.\n\nThe multitude of heretical practices disrupts the scriptures,\ntheir licentiousness only serves to destroy the body.\n\nWithin the chapter, the three Daoists—Peach Force, Deer Force, and Sheep Force—\nembody the external sects in all their forms.\n\nThe external sects number three hundred and sixty,\nbut they are divided into three categories:\nopening the Three Passes,\noperating the Ox-Cart,\nascending the Ridge,\nand the methods of mud pellets, chest supplementation, and returning essence—\nall these are recorded in *The Yellow Court* and *The Spirit Pivot*,\nalong with the true scriptures of the immortals.\nLater generations failed to receive the true transmission,\nand passed on these methods in error—\nthey seem plausible but are fundamentally false,\nthe most likely to mislead and cause harm.\n\nGuangchengzi said:\n*\"Cease your laborious efforts with the Ox-Cart and Elixir Furnace,\nfor the Blessed Embryo of the Crane and the Breath of the Tortoise\nare naturally everlasting.\"*\n\nBecause the human body contains Heaven and Earth,\neach inhalation and exhalation has its own roots and connections.\nThe Governing and Conception Vessels follow the movement of the qi,\nforming the natural rotation of Heaven’s fate—\nlike the Ox-Cart.\n\nThose who falsely practice opening the Three Passes,\nturning the pulley,\nand forcefully manipulate their essence,\ndisturbing their bones—\nall these are unnatural,\ncontrary to Heaven and harmful to principle,\nand sever the Great Dao.\n\nThey do not realize that the Ox-Cart is Heaven’s natural design,\nits divine movement ceaseless—\nonce human interference begins,\nit becomes choked and stagnant,\nblood congeals and qi solidifies,\nand strange poisons and chronic diseases arise—\nthis is truly the method of hastening death.\n\nThe border of Ox-Cart Country lies between the Black River and the Heaven-Piercing River,\nembodying the meaning of the Ox-Cart’s stagnation.\n\nThe disciples heard the commotion\nand assumed it was an earthquake, mountains collapsing,\nthunderous claps of lightning,\nand cries of people and neighing of horses—\nall descriptions of unnatural, forced actions,\nevoking dread and astonishment.\n\n*\"The Tripitaka Master saw many monks gathered in clusters,\npulling the cart with all their might,\nand striking drums for power,\"*\n—this reveals their failure to harmonize the Five Phases,\nto align with the natural unity of things,\nand to follow the effortless Dao.\n\n*\"The cart was loaded with bricks, tiles, wood, and plants,\"*\n—this shows they were collecting dross, heavy and impure substances.\n\nAfter recounting the high slopes, the narrow Ridge Pass, and the great pass,\n*\"How can the cart be pulled up such steep cliffs?\"*\n—all these directly point to their erroneous forcing of energy,\nand their ignorance of the subtle marvels of the Ox-Cart’s natural rotation.\n\nThe Tripitaka Master transformed into the Cloud and Water Immortal,\nand questioned the foreman Daoist about the reason—\nthen went straight to the riverbank,\npassed the Twin Pass,\nand descended the Ridge,\nrequiring no effort at all—\nhow effortlessly he moved with the circumstances!\n\nThe monks said:\n*\"He knows how to refine elixir and transmute mercury,\nand turn stones into gold.\"*\n\nIf the external sects regard operating the Ox-Cart as internal alchemy,\nand refining lead and mercury for consumption as external alchemy,\nthen this is their beginning and end—\nleading the blind and believing in delusion,\nlike a madman or a wild horse,\nand ultimately, never achieving success even unto old age.»",

      "translated_text": "The Master and his disciples attended court, where the Old Daoist made a report, the Great Sage gave his account, and the Village Elder presented his petition—all recounting how the Carriage-Slow Kingdom sought rain through a contest of Buddhist and Daoist magical arts. The Sage-Teachers then explained the rain-invocation method to illustrate the vast difference between heterodox and orthodox Dao. It was not merely to showcase the Great Sage’s superior technique.\n\nThe Dao, fundamentally, is one nature permeating all things, revealing the true essence while harmonizing principle and practice. It transcends all oppositions in duality, merging with all things while operating alone. It is not a technique to be confined by techniques; it is not a display to be confined by displays. One cannot grasp the Dao by clinging to manifest techniques.\n\n*\"The Daoist ascends the platform, using the talisman as his signal.\"*\nThe talisman is but wood’s qi. One sound, two sounds, three sounds, four sounds—all commands arranged through tone and color. This is true technique, yet not the true nature.\n\nThe nature’s resonance has fixed responses, but techniques’ summons are unreliable. Thus, winds, clouds, thunder, and rain sometimes answer and sometimes do not.\n\nThe Great Sage used the staff as his signal.\nThe *Ruyi Staff* embodies the complete principle of the Five Phases.\nOne finger, two fingers, three fingers, four fingers, five fingers—all applied through divine transformation. This is true nature, encompassing true technique.\n\nWhen technique empties, it becomes technique; when technique manifests, it reveals nature. Thus, winds, clouds, thunder, and rain always respond without fail.\n\nThis is what is meant by *\"stabilizing nature and preserving spirit,\"* practicing silently in meditation, with divine power operating alone—without loud incantations or displays of color.\n\nIf one speaks of technique apart from nature, it is like invoking rain through techniques alone—abandoning the root for the branches, not the true nature’s wondrous method.\n\nThus, the Wanderer says:\n*\"This is heterodox magic, not a true fruit of attainment—neither mine nor yours. If you can summon the Dragon King to appear in person,\"*\nthen true nature is revealed, motion and stillness in harmony, hidden and manifest unfathomable—neither confined to display nor bound by technique.\n\nThe Wanderer’s call brought the Dragon King swiftly to manifest his true form:\n*\"Four dragons soared through mist and cloud, dancing toward the Golden Throne Hall.\"*\nBreath and response in perfect communion—how vast and swift their operation!\n\nHow could those heterodox external arts ever steal such transformations or measure their extent?\n\nThe conclusion states:\n*\"The boundless, wondrous true method—\nthe utterly true nature shatters heterodoxy.\"*\nThis has already been made clear.\n\nIn the past, Master Lü heard Master Huanglongji’s Dharma talk. The master asked:\n*\"Who sits below?\"*\nLü replied:\n*\"A wandering Daoist of clouds and water.\"*\nThe master said:\n*\"What if the clouds disperse and the water dries up?\"*\nLü had no answer.\n\nThe master continued:\n*\"The Yellow Dragon appears.\"*\nLü suddenly awakened—realizing the Dragon’s manifestation was true nature, while refining water into gold was yet to grasp the true essence.\n\nHe left this verse:\n*\"Since first seeing the Yellow Dragon,\nI scorn my past mistaken efforts.\"*\n\nThe Wanderer’s summoning of the Dragon King after the clouds dispersed and the water dried is the same meaning.\n\nThose late learners of shallow arts, abandoning true nature for heterodoxy—how little they understand the true call!\n\n---\n**Chapter 46: External Forces Play Tricks, the Heart of the Orthodox Dao Triumphs—The Monkey King Reveals His Might and Destroys All Heresy**\n\nA disciple of enlightenment says:\nThis passage clarifies that true nature, refined a hundred times, is unbreakable, while all heterodox paths will ultimately perish.\n\nThe human body is rare—one must urgently seek a true teacher, sincerely pursue genuine learning, and never indulge in craving the strange or seeking victory. Beware of straying into heterodox paths and inviting ruin upon oneself.\n\nThe Daoist, misplaced in his arts, ashamed to admit defeat, sought to challenge seated meditation for victory in fame.\n*\"The Cloud Ladder\"*—heterodox and external.\n\nThe seated meditation school is the method of closing and stilling the breath, like forgetting all schemes and cutting off all thoughts, entering samadhi and transcending the mind. Yet, since spirit belongs to yin, it cannot yield true fruit.\n\nAncients compared it to grinding bricks to make mirrors—those beneath this level are called *\"crowd-stakes of wood.\"* Here, it is called *\"Cloud Ladder,\"* roughly meaning coiled sitting, focusing thought on the crown, gradually ascending higher, hoping to rise into the sky through false teachings—clearly the deceit of demons, a true external path!\n\nSince the Buddha has no seated form, seated Buddhas are killing Buddhas. Thus, the Wanderer says:\n*\"Speak of seated meditation, and I already concede.\nWhere is this ‘seated nature’ to be found?\"*\n\nTang Sanzang said:\n*\"In my youth, I met a mountain-dwelling Zen monk who taught that stabilizing nature and preserving spirit—even at the gates of life and death—required seated meditation for two or three years.\"*\nThis shows that seated meditation is not true Zen but idle talk from a wandering monk in his youth.\n\nNot only two or three years, but seated meditation to old age—it still avails nothing. True Zen is not confined to sitting.\n\nThe Tiger’s Strength leapt upward, and Tang Sanzang plucked him from the air—this depicts the false state of rising through thought.\n\nYet why, when struck by a great stinkbug, did he shrink his neck, and when bitten by a long centipede, did he get a nosebleed?\nThere is profound meaning here.\n\nThose deeply versed in seated meditation practice on stinking bones and cultivate stillness on poisonous hearts.\n\nThe Buddhist scriptures say:\n*\"Sitting while alive, lying while dead—\njust a stinking bone, why bother with practice?\"*\n\nThe Daoist scriptures say:\n*\"Troublesome poisonous snakes sleep in your heart.\"*\nThis is what Lü Gong tested the monk’s Zen nature with, revealing him as a small snake.\n\nAs for *\"guessing through the partition,\"* it is the art of *shèfù*—mastery of the *Liu Ren Qi Men* divination, relying on fortune-telling and conjecture. Even if one excels in such arts, it has nothing to do with the body, heart, or true nature—also an external path.\n\nInside the cabinet:\n*\"Mountains, rivers, fields, and millet—\nHeaven and Earth, geography—*\nhow did they turn into a *\"broken, discarded bell\"*?",
      "overlap_context": "nly the true nature itself.\n\nIn ancient times, the Divine Maiden conceived by Heaven’s grace,\nand thus the character *\"surname\"* (姓) bears the radical *\"woman\"* (女).\nFor *\"surname\"* inherently contains the marvelous Dao\nof nature’s generation and transformation.\n\nAh!\nThe surname is used to name,\nthe surname is used to represent nature,\nthe surname is used to name the Dao,\nthe surname is used to answer the call.\n\nSpoken casually, yet each word is the Dao—\nprofound, unfathomable, divine!\nWondrous!",

      "translated_text": "The **Tang Seng**’s mind to retrieve the scriptures was most urgent—urgent in his progress, unaware of retreat or survival, each with its own signs. How could he know that opposing the **Dao**’s natural unfolding only brings harm to himself?\n\nThe **Guanpo** said, *“I have long known that Your Majesty has the **Dao**-transcending power to summon winds and call rains, to churn the seas and overturn rivers.”*\n\nWhen **Tang Seng** reached the riverbank, seeing the winds stilled and waves calm, he sought a flat-bottomed boat and crossed in an instant. Yet once in midstream, the **Dao**’s power and **qi** manifested—unexpected, swift, and decisive. Why resort to crude tactics of whipping winds, summoning snow, or freezing ice to ensnare him?\n\nTo stir winds and summon snow, to freeze the river—was it not to deliberately obstruct him, preventing swift passage and thus thwarting his **Dao**-transcending power? To make the crossing treacherous, forcing caution and thus dampening his **qi** and power? Was this not the **good method** of saving the monk and subduing the demon?\n\nWhen the great snow fell and the ice grew bitterly cold, the cold penetrated to the core, and the plum blossoms bloomed in response. When faced with the extraordinary, strategy revived—thus, the extreme of cold births harmony, and the most blocked paths open. Without enduring severe cold, one cannot refine the true nature.\n\nEight hundred layers of ice—this was the most perilous path. To brave danger was to fall into traps; to recognize peril was to walk with caution. Thus, one who treads on a tiger’s tail receives its bite, and one who steps on frost knows its threat. Without plunging into the deepest abyss, one cannot still the restless mind.\n\n**Guanpo** had long understood **Tang Seng**’s impulsive, restless nature. Precisely because this was the **Dao**-aligned path to heaven, she devised this trial—to temper his nature with cold and still his mind with the abyss. Was she not perhaps the very embodiment of the Great Earth?\n\nHow do we know this? Observe how the **Great Sage Equaling Heaven** did not wait for the **Journeyer’s** report but rushed to the bamboo grove to forge weapons. **Guanpo** was the **Great Sage**—when the **Great Sage** captured the fish, **Guanpo** was not present. The **Great Sage** was **Guanpo**. Every word and deed of **Guanpo** served only to protect **Tang Seng** and aid the **King of the River**.\n\nIt is clear: the **Spirit-Sensing King** is but a **Spirit-Sensing Bodhisattva**. The title remains, yet the **King** is transformed by a **Bodhisattva**. Then the **King’s** winds, his great snows, his manipulation of **Tang Seng**—were they not **Guanpo’s** manipulation of the **King** and **Tang Seng**, all of it the **Great Sage’s** manipulation of the **King** and **Tang Seng**, all in accordance with the Buddha’s will to guide the scripture-seeker?\n\n**San Zang** said, *“This season is strange—I do not know if it is spring, summer, autumn, or winter.”* He saw that the **Dao** of heaven follows its natural course, and one must know its signs.\n\nAgain, he said, *“I did not know of the mountains and rivers’ dangers.”* He saw that the **Dao** of earth follows fixed principles, and one must know its changes.\n\nAgain, he said, *“In this world, nothing is heavier than name and profit. Others risk death for gain; my disciple serves the edict with loyalty—yet it is still for fame. How does this differ?”* He saw that greed for profit and fame are burdens, and one must know their harm.\n\nIf the restless mind is indulged, if one treads carelessly upon the layered ice, then one becomes a plaything of fate for eternity, unable to be a master of one’s own life. Thus, one must penetrate the **yin-yang**, deeply understand the times, know when to advance and retreat, guard against danger and foresee risk, abandon schemes and sever thoughts, still the form and rest the mind—only then can one remain true to the **Way**.\n\nIf one rushes forward in haste, it is as if one has passed the mark. The **Way** lies before you, yet you stumble past it. **Sha Wujing’s** words, *“In haste, one fears mistakes,”* are a sharp warning.\n\nThe **River of Heaven’s Passage** is the true path to retrieve the scriptures. The monsters within have not yet been subdued—how can one cross? The **gold in water** is the **Dao**’s marvel—true gold has not yet been obtained, and without it, there is no way to worship the Buddha.\n\nThe scriptures are the **gold in water**, not mere words. The Buddha is present in the world, not only in the Western Paradise. To seek the Buddha while recklessly risking danger—why not stay at Chen’s house to avoid error?\n\nThe **grass-shoe horse** was hasty; to walk on ice was reckless. To step into the abyss and sink to the depths—**Tang Seng** brought this upon himself. What blame is there for the monster?\n\n**Guanpo** said, *“I dare not! I dare not!”*",

      "translated_text": "For now, let him be. Better to endure two days, leisurely and at ease, enjoying oneself.\n\nHow reverent, cautious, and composed! Not only does this spare Tang Seng harm, but it also allows the monster to be contained, opens the door for the three disciples to rescue the drowning, and preserves the Great Sage’s ground for subduing demons. Who else but an embodiment of effortless transformation could do this?\n\nThe three disciples returned to Chen’s village and explained the spirit’s trickery. They headed straight to the water’s edge to seek their master and capture the monster—the moment of returning to origin and restoring essence lies here.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Nine: The Monk Faces Calamity and Sinks into a Watery Abode—Guan Yin Appears in a Fish Basket to Save the Peril**\n\nWu Yi Zi said: *Gold elixir* is the convergence of true yin and true yang qi, following the natural cycles of Heaven and Earth through the four seasons and seventy-two solar terms, returning to the primal origin without artificial coercion. Only when one penetrates Lao Zi’s subtle and wondrous teachings does one realize the Dao’s simplicity and effortless ease—taking and consuming it grants fulfillment of nature and life, instantly ascending to sainthood.\n\nThis passage reveals the marvelous application of subduing the gold elixir, the secret essence of Guan Yin’s mission to Chang’an to relieve suffering and save from peril, marking the grand source and culmination of *The Scripture of Liberation from Calamity*. Its placement in the forty-ninth chapter underscores the *Great Correlation*’s number of fifty, with its full use manifesting in forty-nine—here lies its significance.\n\nThe immortal’s brush cannot fully convey its depth, so only Guan Yin’s miraculous fish-basket form is depicted to illuminate later generations. Its profound implications are boundless, encompassing all phenomena—only those who master yin-yang and comprehend the workings of creation can glimpse its essence. To say *Journey to the West* lacks ingenuity, relying solely on invoking the Southern Sea Bodhisattva in crises, is as blind as groping for a *zheng* (上“竹”下“龠”) in the dark.\n\nThe second disciple devised a plan to descend into the water to seek their master. When Zhu Bajie carried the real and false bodies of the disciple, it signified their shared resolve—urgent need to question a friend and seek their master. How could one not recognize another’s true form when there are forms beyond the body?\n\n*\"I’m right here, Old Monkey!\"*\nBut calling to the deaf awakens no fool—*\"You’re still carrying me!\"*\nAt the sound of the song, your original form remains.\n\n*Hurry, hurry—no delay!*\nLift your head—this is the Water Turtle’s domain.\n\nTransformed into Shrimp Mother, question Shrimp Grandma—\nThe Great-Bellied One speaks of vitality;\nEncounter Stone Lizi, listen to Stone Xiang—\nThe Living Tomb’s true master weeps over the path to death.\n\nIf the disciples could find their master together, what fear is there that the true scriptures won’t reach home?\n\nThe monk wept in grief, recounting the watery disaster—not out of hatred for water, but acknowledging that from birth to return to the source, water’s role is indispensable, never to be overlooked.\n\nThe disciple called out: *\"Master, do not grieve over the watery calamity. The scriptures say: ‘Earth is the mother of the Five Phases; wood is the source of the Five Phases. Without earth, nothing grows; without water, nothing thrives.’\"* This echoes the meaning: *\"The Four Symbols and Five Phases rely entirely on earth; the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams cannot depart from it.\"* The point is clear—no need for further annotation.\n\nHaving clarified the situation, the disciple ordered Zhu Bajie and Sha Wujing to enter the water to fight separately—why? The monster is the *true gold in water*, a convergence of yin-yang and the Five Phases’ qi, already formed. Yet, obstructed by the talisman’s solar fire, its time has not come, so it cannot return to origin and attain its true fruition. Only Zhu Bajie’s wood-fire refinement and Sha Wujing’s true earth can subdue it.\n\n*\"Wielding a nine-pronged red copper mallet\"*—a symbol of pure yang, standing alone and unyielding.\n\nZhu Bajie said: *\"You fake being the Spirit King of Illusions, devouring children in Chen’s village! I’m Chen Qing’s one-catty gold—don’t you recognize me?\"*\nNot to make the king recognize him, but to let those refining the elixir do so.\n\nAt this moment, only a female form appears—no mention of boys. Beneath the water, a fierce battle unfolds among the three. Do not mistake this for the initial convergence of the Five Phases forming the embryo—this is the later stage of ten-month fire refinement after the embryo is formed.\n\nThe verse reads: *\"With fate and affinity, the Dao is complete\"*—yin-yang union.\n*\"Mutual generation and conquest, as countless as grains of sand\"*—fire refinement.\n*\"Earth conquers water; water dries up to the bottom\"*—water solidifies with earth.\n*\"Water generates wood; wood flourishes in blossom\"*—wood thrives with water.\n\nIn Chan practice, this merges into unity;\nIn elixir refinement, the three families are distinctly subdued.\n*\"Earth is the mother, sprouting golden buds—\nGolden water births the infant\"*—earth generates gold and water.\n*\"Water is the root, nourishing wooden flowers—\nWood radiates fiery splendor\"*—wood and fire refine the gold.\n*\"The Five Phases converge yet remain distinct—\nThus the faces change, each contending differently\"*—\nDuring refinement, though still converging, the fire’s intensity shifts constantly, each phase distinct—hence the monk’s battle with the monster involves ever-changing forms.\n\nTo read this verse merely as Five Phases generation-conquest rhetoric misses its profundity.\n\n*\"The two feigned defeat, luring it out to battle.\"*",

      "original_text": "一定要和她动手。 ”“这一国的人，却不是怪物，还是一国人。 若打杀无限平人，你心何忍？ ”此寓言彼小国而真阴受伤也。 《悟真篇》曰：“大小无伤两国全。 ”言彼既无伤，我亦有济，方成妙道。 行者预定定身法，而设“假亲脱网”之计，只骗他把通关文牒用了印，交付与我，以便西行，“一则不伤她的性命，二来不损你的元神”，岂非彼此无伤，两全其美？ 此假亲、定身而脱网者，无非为得其通关宝樱若无女国之通关宝印，无路取经，故必须女王添注法名，亲手画押也。 西女为取经之正路要站，所以设有迎阳驿、照胎泉，与他国之通关牒文不同。 “三藏并倚香肩，同登凤辇，到西关之外。 ”行者三人“同心合意，结束整齐”。 “长老对女王拱手道：‘陛下请回，让贫僧取经去也。 ’”八戒至驾前嚷道：‘我们和尚家，和你这粉骷髅做甚夫妻？ ’”一声喝破，须知国色不过骷髅，假亲无非为道。 一得关文应解脱，三人同志切防危。 《敲爻歌》曰：“夺走烟花断淫欲，行禅唱咏胭粉词。 ”《丹经》曰：“不色之色乃真色，不交之交乃神交。 ”此法性西来，计脱胭花之的旨也。 女王于牒文内独提出“陈”字，明自东部抵西。 东为《震》男，西为《兑》女，噫！ 《震》、《兑》交欢，似世法而非世法； 阴阳配偶，假夫妻而是夫妻。 顺而不顺，逆以成其顺； 用而不用，洁以善其用。 离女色不离女色，真交媾非真交媾。 “路旁闪出女子”，忽把唐僧摄去，烟花风月之间，可畏也哉！ 第五十五回　色邪淫戏唐三藏　性正修持不坏身 悟一子曰：此篇明女色伤人，其毒与蝎相敌，故曰：“毒敌山”。 称“琵琶洞”者，象蝎之形。 蝎至成精，阴毒无比； 女至淫邪，伤人益甚。 行者伤其头，八戒伤其口，如来痛难禁，菩萨不敢近，俱形容其毒之不可当，非蝎状妇人，是妇人状蝎也。 上文国色之女，处女也，人也，取经必由之正路，非得其掌国之信宝，不可以西行。 能假婚定身而脱网，不但修命更修性。 此风月之女，淫女也，取经误走之邪径，若遭其伤人之马钩，必至于中毒。 倘不能坚持真性而沾染，不但害性并害命。 故遇国色之女，以修命之术修性，性由命全； 遇风月之女，以修性之真修命，命由性保。 提纲“色邪淫戏”、“性正修持”所由着也。 西梁女辈都道“是白日飞升之罗汉”，“错认了中华男子”，正指女国乃修丹者白日飞升之真去处，不可错认了中华男子为人种，而不知其有如此超脱也。 悔悟回朝，无损有益。 唐僧当第一大难之中，而行第一大用，在得女工通关信宝，添注名字之妙。 仙师恐世人强猜妄想，谓有所沾染而得之，乃抛身入身，至于坏身，而莫之能救，故又设此一喻，以示儆戒。 青石屏门坚牢，未易打破； 蜜蜂采花贪恋，最难分解。 “人肉馅”，包藏祸心； “澄沙馅”，隐充国色。 “富贵荣华”，犹堪共赏； “清闲自在”，独嗜欢娱。 “正好念佛看经做道伴”，分明佛口蝎心，如羊伴虎； 莫道“百岁和谐真个是”，须知猴头佛手，倒马钩猪。 女主是人动以礼，犹可将计就计； 此怪是邪欲害命，急直强打精神。 劈破递素馍，三藏几乎打开一藏； 囫囵与荤包，道心却能不露人心。",

How could you bear to slaughter countless innocents?\"*\nThis metaphorically speaks of how that small realm’s true *yin* is wounded.\n\n*The Awakening to Reality* states:\n*\"Great or small, harm none—preserve both nations whole.\"*\nFor if she is unharmed, and we are aided, then the Dao’s marvel is complete.\n\nThe Pilgrim preemptively cast the *Ding Shen* spell and devised the *\"False Kinship to Escape the Net\"* stratagem—tricking her into stamping the pass documents and handing them over, so they could proceed westward. *\"First, we spare her life; second, we preserve your vital essence.\"* Is this not mutual non-harm, achieving both goals?\n\nThis false kinship, this *Ding Shen* escape—all for securing the *Tongguan Baoyin*. Without the Land of Women’s pass seal, there is no path to the Sutras. Thus, the queen must personally add the name and affix her signature.\n\nThe Western Land of Women is the critical waypoint for seeking the Sutras, hence the *Yingyang Station* and *Zhaotai Spring*—its pass documents differ from other realms.\n\n*\"The Master leaned on the fragrant shoulder, together ascending the phoenix palanquin to the Western Gate.\"*\nThe three disciples *\"united in heart, harmonized in purpose, their attire in order.\"*\n\nThe Master bowed to the queen: *\"Your Majesty, return—let your humble monk depart to fetch the Sutras.\"*\nZhu Bajie barked at her: *\"What business do we monks have with you, this painted skeleton, as husband and wife?\"*\nWith one shout, know this: beauty is but a skeleton, and false kinship is but the Dao.\n\nOnce the pass is secured, liberation follows—three hearts must guard against peril.\n*The Knocking on the Diviner’s Song* says:\n*\"Snatch away the smoke and flowers, severing lustful desire,\nRecite the *chan* hymns, singing the rouge-laced verses.\"*\n*The Danjing* says:\n*\"The non-color is true color; the non-uniting is divine union.\"*\nThis law of nature comes from the West—its intent is to escape the painted flowers.\n\nThe queen’s pass document uniquely specifies *\"Chen\"*—clearly marking the journey from east to west.\nEast is *Zhen* (☳, male), west is *Dui* (☱, female). Ah!\n*Zhen* and *Dui* in union—seemingly worldly yet transcending it;\nYin and yang paired—false marriage yet true marriage.\nFollowing yet not following; opposing yet achieving harmony;\nUsing yet not using; purity yet perfect application.\nNeither leaving nor clinging to female beauty—true copulation is not carnal.\n*\"A woman suddenly appears beside the road,\"*\nand seizes Tang Sanzang—beware the allure of smoke and flowers!\n\n---\n**Fifty-Fifth Chapter**\n*The Lustful Demon’s Trickery*\n*Upholding True Nature Preserves the Body*\n\nA Disciple of Awakening says:\nThis passage reveals how female beauty harms—its venom rivals that of scorpions, hence *\"Poison Rivaling the Mountain.\"*\nThe *\"Lute Cave\"* symbolizes the scorpion’s form.\nWhen scorpions become spirits, their *yin* venom is unmatched;\nWhen women indulge in licentiousness, their harm is even greater.\nThe Pilgrim struck its head, Zhu Bajie its mouth—\nThe Tathagata could barely endure the pain,\nThe Bodhisattva dared not approach.\nAll depict the venom’s overwhelming might—\nNot a scorpion-like woman, but a woman shaped like a scorpion.\n\nThe earlier queen—maiden, human—was the necessary path for seeking the Sutras.\nWithout her realm’s sovereign seal, one cannot proceed westward.\nTo fake marriage and escape through *Ding Shen* was not only to preserve life but to refine nature.\n\nThis later woman—lustful, a detour on the path—\nIf one falls into her snare, the poisoned hook will strike,\nAnd unless one steadfastly upholds true nature while resisting temptation,\nOne harms not only nature but life itself.\n\nThus, when encountering the queen’s beauty,\nUse life-preserving methods to refine nature—nature thrives through life’s integrity;\nWhen facing the lustful woman,\nUse true nature’s purity to safeguard life—life is secured through nature’s virtue.\n\nThis is the essence of *\"Lustful Demon’s Trickery\"* and *\"Upholding True Nature.\"*\n\nThe Western Liang women all claimed:\n*\"We are *White Day Ascension* Arhats,\"*\n*\"Mistaken for Chinese men.\"*\nThis points to the Land of Women as the true realm of *Dan* cultivation—where one ascends in daylight—\nNot to be confused with Chinese men as mere mortals,\nFor they possess such transcendence.\n\nRegret and awakening return to the court—harm none, benefit all.\n\nIn Tang Sanzang’s first great ordeal,\nHe fulfilled his greatest purpose:\nSecuring the queen’s pass seal and adding his name—\nA marvelous stroke.\n\nThe Immortal Master, fearing worldly misinterpretation—\nThat one might think he gained through defilement—\nCast himself into the body, even to the point of ruin,\nYet none could save him.\nThus, he offers this parable as a warning.\n\nThe green stone screen door is unbreakable;\nThe bee clings to flowers, reluctant to part.\n*\"Human flesh filling\"*—concealing treachery;\n*\"Clear sand filling\"*—disguised as beauty’s allure.\n*\"Wealth, honor, glory\"*—still worth sharing;\n*\"Leisure and ease\"*—only she craves delight.\n*\"Just right for chanting scriptures, reciting the Buddha’s words as companions,\"*\nYet clear as the Buddha’s mouth, hidden as a scorpion’s heart—\nLike a sheep with a tiger.\n*\"Do not say ‘a hundred years of harmony is true,’*\nFor know this: the monkey’s head, the Buddha’s hand,\nThe inverted hook, the pig’s snare.\"\n\nThe queen, though human, moves with propriety—\nOne may counter her schemes with guile.\nThis demon, however, harms life through lust—\nOnly brute force and spiritual resolve suffice.\n\nSplitting the white bread roll nearly revealed a hidden treasure;\nThe whole roasted meat package concealed a lustful trap—\nYet the Dao-heart remained unshaken, though the human heart was exposed.",

sharp edge—\nNo matter if you’ve refined her in the Eight Trigrams Furnace,\nOr forged her from Heaven-Roaring Golden Cangue Metal,\nShe’s a wanton, cheap thing—\nCalling her husband to lure him in, yet wasting the iron-mouthed blade\nHoned at High Old Village to pierce the earth.\n\nAh, the Master Tripitaka!\nA true monk with true precepts—\nCloud-like emotions, rain-like intentions,\nUnseen, unheard, untouched by thought—\nForged into my ten thousand pounds of refined gold.\n\nAh, the demon woman!\nHer yin-scheming, yin-poisoned hands—\nCoaxing, binding, calling out, *\"Good husband, good wife!\"*\nAlmost draining a man’s very marrow.\n\nAh, the Bodhisattva’s mercy!\nRevealing her feet, knowing her tail,\nPointing to her true form’s subjugation—\nUnless one attains supreme enlightenment.\n\nAh, the star Maotai!\nManifesting her form, raising her head,\nHer high cries dying on the slope—\nTruly, the *\"day-see\"* snow melts away.\n\nWhen the Yang Official arrives, the lustful demon is suppressed;\nWhen the sun reddened in the pond, the yin-monster vanishes—\nWhoever steadfastly cultivates true nature\nWill not let worldly desires disturb them.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Severing dusty ties, abandoning form’s illusion,\nPushing through the golden sea to awaken the Zen heart.\"*\n\nOnce, reading the Buddhist scriptures,\nMañjuśrī’s disciple Kumārajīva—\nA divine monk—\nComposed *The Treatise on Reality* in two volumes,\nRecited at the Grass Hall Temple.\nEmperor Yao Xing and a thousand high-ranking monks and officials\nSat in solemn silence, listening.\n\nKumārajīva suddenly left his seat and said to Xing:\n*\"Two boys have climbed my desire-barrier—\nThey need a woman.\"* Xing then summoned palace maids,\nAnd after one union, two sons were born.\nHow could this true monk have broken the precept?\nXing further forced ten courtesans upon him,\nSetting up a separate dwelling for him to receive them—\nWhat difference is this from embracing a *pipa*?\n\nAt that time, many monks followed Kumārajīva’s example.\nHe then gathered needles to fill a bowl\nAnd said to the assembly:\n*\"If any can match this feat, only then may you keep a wife.\"*\nHe lifted a spoonful of needles and swallowed them,\nNo different from eating.\n\nThe monks, ashamed, bowed in submission.\n\nKumārajīva had already cultivated an indestructible golden body—\nThus he could swallow needles and still conceive children,\nDispelling desire’s barrier, not breaking the precept.\nReceiving courtesans was but playful *samādhi*—\nNot like embracing a *pipa*.\n\nAt his passing, the funeral pyre burned his body to ashes,\nYet his tongue did not rot—\nProving his immortality.\n\nBefore attaining the elixir, how could one break precepts\nAnd embrace a *pipa*?\n\n---\n\nThe Fifth-Sixth Chapter:\n*The Mad God Slays the Grass Bandits*\n*The Dao-Confused Monkey Frees His Mind*\n\nThe son understood:\n*\"The Buddha said: ‘All minds are false minds—\nThis is called mind.\nWhy?\nThe past mind cannot be obtained;\nThe present mind cannot be obtained;\nThe future mind cannot be obtained.’\nFor the mind’s essence is empty—\nResponding to all things yet not enslaved by them;\nNeither within nor without—\nBoundless and impartial.\nNeither welcoming nor following—\nActing where there is no action.\nLike a mirror, like a valley—\nThings come and are reflected naturally.\n\nThus, though myriad changes arise,\nThis mind remains pure,\nNever disturbed by them;\nStill, never driven by them—\nThis is the true mind.\n\nIf, before things arrive, one has a mind to welcome them;\nIf, when things arrive, one is attached to them;\nIf, after things depart, one chases after them—\nThis is the Buddha’s teaching:\n‘All minds are false minds.’\n\nFalse minds harm the mind—\nDust accumulates, darkening the mirror;\nFilth clogs, blocking the valley.\n\nThus, having a mind is letting the mind go;\nHaving no mind is truly gathering the mind.\n\nYet cultivating the mind in non-existence\nStill risks falling back into aimlessness—\nAimlessness leads to obscured nature and trembling life,\nDriving one toward death—\nThe mind’s root of mortality.\n\nOnly when the mind dies does nature pierce through;\nWhen nature pierces through, life is fixed—\nAnd returns to its origin.\n\nThe secret of eternal life lies in killing the mind;\nThe secret of no-mind lies in killing the mind;\nThe secret of killing the mind lies in forgetting the self;\nThe secret of forgetting the self lies in nurturing *qi*;\nThe secret of nurturing *qi* lies in tranquility without madness.\n\nThese three principles first warn of the harm in intentional mind,\nThen of the harm in intentional no-mind,\nAnd finally of the harm in both intentional mind and no-mind.\n\nOnly when struck before the Buddha as a six-eared macaque\nDoes one grasp the wondrous truth of killing the mind.\n\nAlas!

      "translated_text": "The **Awakened One** said: *\"The Dragon Clan Master spoke: ‘The greatest affliction of humanity lies in having a body; if I had no body, what affliction would remain?’ But I say: The greatest affliction of humanity lies in having a mind; if I had no mind, what affliction would remain?’*\n\n*The *Nanhua Jing* [Zhuangzi] says: ‘I guard my form and forget my body, gaze at turbid water and lose myself in the clear depths.’ But I say: I guard my mind and forget my body, gaze at turbid water and lose myself in the clear depths. Why so?*\n\n*The mind’s presence is the grasping of **dharma**. The mind’s presence as unvirtuous is the grasping of **non-dharma**; the mind’s presence as virtuous is the grasping of **non-non-dharma**. All sages, through **non-doing as dharma**, distinguish subtly—one must abandon **non-dharma**, abandon **non-non-dharma**; if **dharma** is abandoned, what mind remains? Thus, without guarding, without mind, the depths of all phenomena are illuminated.*\n\n*Yet to say ‘no mind’ while letting the mind loose into **emptiness** is more harmful than having a mind. Why? Before **perfect clarity** arises, virtue and vice are confused—this is the **vast and chaotic void**. ‘The Great Sage soared in the void, advancing and retreating in difficulty; seeing the Tang Monk again, he gave no reply, seized the horse, and chanted the **Tight-Fitting Fillet Spell**.’ To let the mind loose into **emptiness** is to fall into the **vast and chaotic void**. How could one know that the **no-mind of no-mind** is both having and not having, releasing yet not releasing—thus able to reach the Western Paradise? If one is merely **vast and chaotic**, how could one go?*\n\n*The Pilgrim said: ‘Only fear that without me, you cannot reach the Western Paradise.’ The Monk replied: ‘I truly do not need you.’ Again chanting the **mantra**, he did not turn back his mind. This was true **vast and chaotic void**. The Great Sage could only rise again into the void—desiring to have no mind while also abandoning the true mind, unable to force others to awaken to this mind.*\n\n*Suddenly enlightened, he said: ‘This monk is faithless; I shall report him to Guanyin Bodhisattva.’ Guanyin is the **pure ocean of divine insight and discernment**. The Pilgrim said: ‘The Master has forgotten his duty and betrayed his gratitude, driving away his disciple and ruining a piece of virtuous destiny, without considering the suffering of black and white.’ His mind was deluded and unperceiving—how great was the harm of **no-mind**!*\n\n*The Bodhisattva said: ‘The Monk’s heart is entirely virtuous; you have slain many bandits. By my judgment, it is your own unvirtue.’ If one says the heart is entirely virtuous, then the unvirtuous mind should be abandoned. The Pilgrim said: ‘Even if I am unvirtuous, my merits should offset my crimes—I should not be driven away like this.’ If one says the mind has merits and crimes, the **anger-mind** is unvirtuous, yet even the virtuous mind is abandoned—how could this be right?*\n\n*This reporting to Guanyin Bodhisattva was not a complaint, but in the place of divine insight and wisdom, the heart’s proper abandonment and non-abandonment were analyzed, and its subtle principle was determined. Only when the **Tight-Fitting Fillet Spell** was recited was the mind truly unbound, returning to its original nature. Yet ‘the **Tight-Fitting Fillet Spell** was transmitted by the Tathagata, but there is no **Loosening Fillet Spell**’—without a spell to transmit, it arises naturally, and without reaching the Tathagata’s realm, liberation is unattainable. Thus he said: ‘I shall go and petition the Tathagata to recite the **Loosening Fillet Spell**.’*\n\n*Marvelous, the Bodhisattva! Neither abandonment nor loosening was possible, so she said: ‘Stay here for now.’ ‘Seated upon the lotus throne, directing the mind through the **Three Realms**, with wisdom-eyes gazing afar, encompassing the universe.’ This is as the *Vajra Sutra* says: ‘One must dwell thus, subduing the mind in this way’—already hinting at the subtle realm of **no-mind**. ‘In an instant, she spoke: “Sun Wukong, your master will soon face bodily harm; he will come to seek you shortly. You must remain here—I will tell the Tang Monk to return with you to fetch the scriptures and fulfill your true destiny.”’ The Great Sage bowed in submission, standing at the foot of the lotus throne.*\n\n*Ah! A mind of pure clarity is the Buddha’s true meaning; **calm-abiding and insight** are inseparable, dwelling in the **Three Refuges** of the mind. To release yet not release is the truth of **no-mind**. Thus the chapter’s theme is declared: ‘The True Pilgrim complains of his sufferings at Mount Lava.’*\n\n*The Monk left the village at the fifth watch, both hungry and thirsty; the Foolish One leapt into the air, carefully observing—yet saw no trace of the village. This was the spirit not guarding its dwelling, having a dwelling yet not seeing it, observing falsely. Desiring to ease hunger but unable to obtain alms; desiring to quench thirst but unable to find water—this was the false realm of **no-mind**. Thus he suddenly saw the False Pilgrim and took him for the True; saw false water and took it for true; heard the False Pilgrim’s words ‘without me, you cannot reach the Western Paradise’ and believed it was the True coming to harass him; saw the False Pilgrim’s changing expression and took it for the True’s; saw the False Pilgrim’s cudgel striking his back and believed it was the True. In his own delusion, how could he avoid being dazed and confused on the ground, losing his satchel and scriptures without knowing? This was the harm of **no-mind**, unable to distinguish virtue, vice, truth, or falsehood.*\n\n*Eight Rules begged for alms to obtain food, and in a moment of **no-mind**, saw a grass hut and begged for rice, changing his appearance; having filled his bowl, he met Sand Monk drawing water, joyfully returning. He thought his mind was pure, free from defilement, as if he had obtained a full bowl. How could he know that ‘the white horse broke free, neighing and galloping beside the road, while the baggage and scriptures had vanished without a trace?’*",

In the fifty-eighth installment—*\"Two Hearts Disrupt the Great Cosmic Order\"*—*\"The Difficulty of Cultivating True Stillness in Solitary Unity\"*—\nMaster Wujī said: *\"Man has but one mind; those with mind possess this mind, those without mind also possess this mind.\nWith mind, there is true and false within the mind;\nwithout mind, there is true and false within the absence of mind.\nTheir forms and functions are identical.\nIf one cannot extinguish falsehood and adhere to truth, the two minds will clash in confusion, unable to distinguish right from wrong—how then can one gather the Five Phases to cultivate true stillness?\"*\n\nThe brushstrokes of this passage all depict the chaos of the two minds, yet the key focus lies in the phrase *\"the difficulty of cultivating in solitary unity.\"*\nFor the secret of *\"the difficulty of solitary cultivation\"* lies within *\"the disturbance of the two minds.\"*\nThus, only after the Monkey is struck down does the text clarify *\"once again in harmony, united in heart\"*—six words that encapsulate the essence of gathering the Five Phases to refine the elixir.\n\nThe Master’s teaching transcends the divine—it pierces through the demonic and uproots the celestial root!\n\nWukong and Sand Monk’s *\"two streams of light\"*—one rooted in genuine conscience, the other harboring doubt—already illuminate the meaning of *\"harmony in heart and intent.\"*\n*\"The two examined outside the cave and saw a pilgrim identical in every way.\"*\nThis was when the Triple Gem released the true Wukong, bringing him along as well.\n*\"Mingled together, indistinguishable as true or false\"*—this lies hidden within one’s own solitude, something no outsider can discern for them.\n\nThus, even the divine vision of the Falling Rock Mountain spirit could not perceive it.\nWhy?\nBecause the two minds are one mind, and external observation cannot unify them.\n\nEven reciting the tight-fitting cauldron incantation could not expose it.\nWhy?\nBecause the two minds originate from one mind, and no incantation can forcibly separate them.\n\nEven with the divine eyes of the celestial hosts or the Mirror of Demonic Detection, it remains indistinct.\nWhy?\nBecause the two minds belong to one Wukong—vision cannot exhaust its depths, nor can the mirror’s reflection reach its limits.\n\nEven *\"knowing oneself as a friend does\"*—later shifts in stance, hidden and revealed emotions—cannot be fixed;\n*\"knowing one’s younger brother as a teacher does\"*—sudden unity and separation, coming and going unpredictably—cannot be measured.\n\nHow profound is the difficulty of distinguishing true and false minds!\nFor they dwell in the most profound and obscure realms, beyond what can be observed through external appearances.\nThus, one must seek them within the profound and obscure.\n\nEntering the Forest of the Dead’s Hall of Records, one searches for them in the Monkey Ledger—\nand if there are no two minds, there is not even one mind, already erased in the chaos of the Great Uproar!\n\nSpeaking of the truth of *wu-xin* [無心], one realizes the two minds are both delusion.\nTo dwell and listen, the true essence will naturally reveal itself.\nThus, Dìzhàng Bodhisattva said, *\"Wait! Wait!\nLet me listen closely to discern truth from falsehood for you.\"*\n\n*Dì* [谛] listening—what others cannot know, yet you alone perceive.\n*Dì* listening, bowing in silence, soon recognizing the strange.\nIt is not called *\"seeing\"* but *\"listening,\"* nor merely *\"listening\"* but *\"close listening.\"*\nRejecting sharp hearing and bright sight, using the heart’s profound listening—this is the breadth of insight and the height of perception.\n\nAgain, *\"Do not expose it directly; do not assist in capturing him.\"*\nWhy?\nBecause the heart has the power of self-deception, and there is no method to bind the heart.\nHe who knows this heart possesses this heart;\nhe who is ignorant of this knowing also possesses this heart.",

*“‘Kang’ (康) is harmony (齐).\n‘My lord is the *yang* parent that nurtures the body.’”*\nSpeaking of how *yin* and *yang* in perfect balance\nbring forth the flourishing of all things;\ntrue *yin* without *yang* cannot sustain and nourish the ten thousand beings.\n\nWhen they stand side by side, leaning down to embrace,\nand speak in unison to nourish the treasure,\nclinging to each other in

incantation,\nhe clutches it to his shoulder.\nThis cannot be swallowed whole,\nnor transformed at will—\nthus he cannot keep it without losing it again.\n\nThe Bull Demon King scatters the

of the beast is revealed—\nseeing remorse and regret, there remains a chance for return.\n\nRiding the clouds straight back to the Green Cloud,\nthe Demon Queen shouts in rage: *“Heaven-damned!”*\nBoth husband and wife were careless,\nthus the true treasure was lost,\nand they are now in frantic haste.\n\nThe monkey steals the grandmother’s treasure,\nthe Bull King seizes

Hut”* (三顾茅庐)\nand *“Three Battles at Zhu’s Village”* (三打祝家庄),\nas though these were all sacred *Daoist* talismans (宝箓),\nmere set phrases in the novel.\nIt is like reading *The Strategy of the Rabbit Garden* (《兔园策》)\nand *The Dragon-Tiger Scripture* (《龙虎经》)\nwithout discerning their true distinctions.\n\nThe Fire-Flame Mountain descends from heaven,\nmeeting the earth—\nthis is the union of *Qian* (乾, Heaven) and *Kun* (坤, Earth),\ngiving rise to the three *yang* (阳) energies,\nthe Great Sage’s primordial *yang* *qi* (真动之气) transformed,\nas explained by the adept who guards the Eight Trigram Elixir Furnace (八卦丹炉之道人).\n\n**The First Attempt (一调):**\nThe Great Sage, dwelling in *Kun* (Earth),\nseeks to borrow from *Qian* (Heaven).\nIn the first borrowing, *Xun* (巽, Gentle Wind) is born as the eldest daughter—\n*Xun* is wind, hence the fan;\nobtained from *Qian*’s Metal (金), hence the Iron Fan Princess (铁扇公主).\nAs the eldest daughter of Earth (土),\nshe is the first *yin* (阴) to appear.\n\n**The Second Attempt (二调):**\nThe Great Sage, dwelling in *Kun* (Earth),\nborrows again.\nIn the second borrowing, *Li* (离, Fire) is born as the middle daughter—\n*Li* is fire, hence she sits in the south,\nthe symbol of a sovereign facing south,\nthus the Jade-Face Princess (玉面公主) is obtained.\nAs the middle daughter of Earth,\nshe is the second *yin* to appear.\n\n**The Third Attempt (三调):**\nThe Great Sage, dwelling in *Kun* (Earth),\nborrows a third time.\nIn the third borrowing, *Dui* (兑, Joy) is born as the youngest daughter—\n*Dui* is the marsh, the union of Water and Metal;\npositioned in the west with a white hue,\nhence the White Bull (白牛).\nThe bull belongs to Earth yet bears Metal,\ntraversing all nine palaces,\nits power vast—\nthus the Great Power King (大力王),\nthe *yang* parent that nurtures the Iron Fan Princess’s body,\nthe true *yin* sovereign—\nthus the third *yin* appears,\nand the true fan is offered.\n\nThrough *Kun*’s three borrowings,\nthree *yin* energies emerge,\nto subdue the fire and nurture all things—\nall rooted in the primordial *yin* *qi* (真乙之气).\nThis is the subtle essence of the Great Sage’s\nfirst, second, and third attempts to borrow the fan.\n\n*“If I were to demand it directly from his face,\nhe would certainly refuse.\nBut if he fans me once,\nI would be sent eight hundred and forty thousand *li* away!”*\nThis reveals how *yin* and *yang* have cycles of mutual borrowing,\nand how Earth can act as the guiding *qi* (用神).\n\nAbove, it can adapt and shift with the flow—\nEarth subdues Water in

      "translated_text": "「The sixty-second chapter—*\"Purifying the Heart by Sweeping the Pagoda\"* and *\"Binding the Demon to Return to the Dao by Cultivating the Body\"*—\n\n**Treasured in Understanding** said: *\"When gold contains jade, the mountain shines; when water cradles pearls, the river enchants. The Floating Pagoda stores treasures, its light illuminating the four quarters, while a human body attains the Dao, its purity shining through face and back—one principle alone.\"*\n\nYet, when the **virtue** (*dé*) of the sovereign wanes, the **Pleiades** (*Qūyè*) shift their abode; when the ruler’s heart is misguided, **Mars** (*Yínghuò*) alters its course. The **Pearl River** (*Pǔzhū*) regards profit and loss as ebb and flow, while **Jing Province’s** fields rise or fall with fortune’s division and union. The waters of **Xīyáng Creek** are clear or turbid as they reflect the governor’s greed or integrity; the **stone mirror of Lin’an** (*Lín’ān shíjìng*) brightens or darkens according to the official’s praise or censure. The logic of **omens and responses** indeed has its truth.\n\nThis **Golden Pagoda** (*Jīnguāngtǎ*), though its treasures depart and its light recedes, is a metaphor for the human body stained by defilement and thus losing its **Dao/Way** (*dào*), where ruler and subject alike falter in their **virtue/power** (*dé*) and their transformations are obstructed—truly a profound and practical meaning. In the previous chapter, the master and disciple achieved balance through water and fire, having already attained the **mystic Dao** (*miàodào*); now, with **dissipation and idle thoughts** (*sǎnchǎn xiāoyáo*) dispelled, the Western Paradise lies in sight.\n\nYet one must **embrace the One and preserve the Primordial** (*bàoyī shǒuyuán*), nurturing it diligently at every moment, so that the heart’s clarity remains untainted. Only then can one await the **fulfillment of merit and the completion of practice** (*hòuzú gōngwán*). If even the slightest negligence or indulgence arises, then **supreme virtue** (*zhìdé*) cannot be cultivated, and the **refined Dao** (*zhìdào*) will not solidify. Hence, the opening verse of *\"Temporary Residence by the River\"* (*Línjiāngxiān*) is inscribed to emphasize this essential truth.\n\nIt says:\n*\"In every twelve-hour span, forget not to tend it,\na hundred moments of practice fully gathered.\nThree years, ten times eight thousand cycles—\ndo not let the **Divine Water** (*Shénshuǐ*) run dry,\nnor let the **Sacred Fire** (*Huǒguāng*) grow weary.\nBalancing water and fire without loss,\nthe **Five Phases** (*Wǔxíng*) linked like a hook.\nHarmony of **Yin and Yang** (*Yīnyáng*) ascending to the **Cloud Palace** (*Yúnlóu*),\nriding the **Luan bird** (*Chéngluán*) to the **Purple Palace** (*Zǐfǔ*),\nand crossing the **Hawk bird** (*Guàhè*) to the **Penglai Isles** (*Yíngzhōu*).\"*\nThe meaning is clear: in a year of **thirty-six thousand moments** (*sānwànliùqiè*), three years yield **one hundred and eight thousand moments** (*shísānwànbāqiānqiè*). Each moment must be nurtured with unwavering devotion—no room for idle indulgence. For the **alchemical practice** (*dàn*) that follows, the **preservation of merit** (*bǎogù*) lies in **washing the heart and purifying the mind** (*xǐxīn dílǜ*), rectifying one’s nature. Otherwise, the nature will remain obscured, and the **alchemical elixir** (*dàn*) will not solidify.\n\nAs the master and disciple arrived in the **Sacrificial Realm** (*Jìsài guó*), they saw a monk bound in shackles, his **blue robes** (*lánlǚ*) in tatters, and inquired whether he was the wronged monk from **Golden Light Temple** (*Jīnguāngsì*). The **Three Treasures** (*Sānguì*)—**no-self** (*wúrén*), **no-other** (*wǒ*), and **no-phenomenon** (*wúzhòngshēng*)—are lost when a monk bears such wrongs. Thus, they sighed: *\"A fox spared from death laments, creatures grieve their kind.\"* This **blood-stained Pagoda** (*xiěguì*) is but the **Three Treasures** (*Sānguì*) defiled by blood; its treasures lost, the **Three Treasures** (*Sānguì*) have themselves lost their essence—thus, it is a single calamity.\n\nTogether, they visited the temple gates to witness it. The **Three Treasures** (*Sānguì*) could not bear the sorrow, and after bowing to the Buddha, they turned away, unable to face the sight, yet still perceiving the **great unity of all beings as the heart’s truth** (*Dàtóng yītǐ wéi xīn*). The monks came to kneel and ask: *\"Your forms are not alike.\"* The monk replied: *\"It seems the celestial deities were disturbed; last night, all received a single dream. Today, they truly saw such strange appearances, hence recognizing them.\"* For though **no-self** (*wúrén*), **no-other** (*wǒ*), and **no-phenomenon** (*wúzhòngshēng*) may differ in name, the **Divine Mind** (*Shénmíng*) silently reveals itself, and through **subtle dreams** (*yōumèng*), all are made known.\n\nWith the monks’ recognition of forms through dreams, the **Three Treasures** (*Sānguì*) subtly imply the **Three Illusions** (*Sānxiàng*)—**no-self** (*wúrén*), **no-other** (*wǒ*), and **no-phenomenon** (*wúzhòngshēng*)—and draw the **Sweeping the Pagoda** (*Sǎotǎ*) lesson close to the **Tang Monk’s** (*Tángsēng*) own body and mind. When the text reaches:\n*\"The king said: ‘Holy monk, your noble bearing is so resplendent—how do your disciples appear thus?’\nThe **Great Sage** (*Dàsèng*) heard and said: ‘Your Majesty must not judge by appearances.’\"*\nonly then does the meaning of **no-self** (*wúrén*), **no-other** (*wǒ*), and **no-phenomenon** (*wúzhòngshēng*) fully reveal itself. The **text’s profound intent** (*Wénxīn yōuzào*) holds **divine subtleties and hidden mysteries** (*shéncáng guǐnì*).\n\n**\"Relics\"** (*Shèlì*) are the Buddha’s physical remains. In ancient times, **Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty** (*Suí Rénshào*) composed the *\"Record of the Relics’ Omens and Responses\"* (*Shèlì Gǎn yìng jì*): When a pagoda was raised in **Thinking Awakening Temple** (*Sījué sì*) in **Qin Province’s** (*Qín Huázhōu*) **Hua State** (*Huá*), the heavens sent a **divine snow** (*yīnxuě*). As the **relics** (*shèlì*) descended, the sun shone brightly, casting a **five-colored radiance** (*wǔsè guāngqì*), several zhang above the earth, resembling a **chariot wheel** (*chēlún*), directly covering the pagoda. From tens of miles away, those gazing saw the **relics** (*shèlì*) as a **pure red glow ascending to heaven** (*zhèngchì shàngshǔ tiān*). Once the **relics** (*shèlì*) had settled, clouds and mists rose again, and the **auspicious snow** (*ruìxuě*) scattered like **heavenly flowers** (*tiān huā*) upon people’s robes, lingering without wetting them. The **Golden Light Pagoda** (*Jīnguāngtǎ*)’s **relics** (*shèlì*) emitting light was an **already attested reality** (*yǐrán shíshì*).\n\nHere, the **Golden Light Pagoda** (*Jīnguāngtǎ*) contains **relics** (*shèlì*), and its **auspicious clouds and rainbow hues** (*xiángruì yá cǎi*) are revered by all, near and far—this is no fabricated tale. The realm’s **literati are unvirtuous** (*wénbùxián*), its **martial prowess is weak** (*wǔbùliáng*), and the ruler lacks the **Dao/Way** (*dào*). This leads to **demonic calamities** (*yāoniè*), **blood-soaked theft** (*yǔxuě dào bǎo*), and the **four quarters’ despair** (*sìfāng shīwàng*). The **Tang Monk** (*Tángsēng*) was summoned, yet the blame was unfairly cast upon the monks. How different is this from one who fails to **cultivate the heart and refine virtue** (*xīnxīn dídé*), yet still **complains of heaven and blames others** (*yuán tiān yóu rén*)?\n\nThey said: *\"The **tyrannical ruler** (*hūn jun*), the **corrupt official** (*zāng guān*), **a thousand tortures and myriad oppressive demands** (*qiān bān kǎodǎ, wàn xiáng zhuīqiú*), **the previous two generations were already beaten to death—now they seize us for punishment.**\"* All spoke of **excessive punishments and heavy taxation** (*fánxíng chóuniàn*), **greed and cruelty** (*tānxīn nǔshēng*), **rooting out even the faintest traces of dissent** (*zhīmàn zhūmǎ*), and **deep-seated corruption** (*jīxí jiùrán*)—the very stains that defile.\n\nThe **Tang Monk** (*Tángsēng*) asked: *\"What hour is it now?\"*\nThey replied: *\"This hour has arrived,\"*\n*\"Give me a fresh broom of **new bamboo** (*xīn dǎo*), so I may bathe and sweep away their sufferings.\"*\n\nThis speaks of **self-purification through renewal** (*zìxīn xīn rén*), layer upon layer. If one resolutely begins anew from this very day, as **Pan Cheng** (*Pán Míng*) swore in his **ritual bath** (*mùyù*), then the **lower cultivation will ascend to the highest** (*xiàxué shàngdá*), and the **defilements of the eyes will be cleansed** (*wūguì mùchú*).\n\nAs the **Disciple** (*Xíngzhě*) swept, he heard voices from the pagoda’s summit. Stepping upon the clouds to look, he saw within the **thirteen-layered Pagoda** (*shísān céng tǎ*), two demons seated at its core—one **warming rice** (*pánfàn*), the other with **a bowl and a pot** (*yīwǎn yīhú*), **drinking and gambling** (*cāiquán chījiǔ*). This describes **seeking the body’s treasures** (*jiǎnshēn huòbǎo*), yet one must **steadfastly trust and resolve with clarity** (*wùdúxīn míngjué*), not indulging in **idle doubts or hesitation**.\n\nIf one does not **choose one path and hold fast** (*bùzé yī gùzhí*), yet **repeatedly wavers in uncertainty** (*fǎnfù chíchí*), **endlessly probing without resolution** (*tàntāo wú dìng*), then within the heart, the two demons sit like guests at the pagoda’s core, **endlessly gambling and drinking** (*yīwèi húcāi*)—nothing but **foolish conjecture** (*húcāi*).\n\nThe **Disciple** (*Xíngzhě*) pressed forward, and the two demons said: *\"This has nothing to do with us! There is one who stole the treasures elsewhere!\"*\nFor **doubt and conjecture** (*cāiyí*) are the true afflictions, arising from **confused understanding** (*zhīshì zhuóluàn*).\n\nThey named **chaotic demons** (*Luànshíshān Bìbōtǎn*), **Sage Kings** (*Wànshèng Lóngwáng*) and **Sage Queens** (*Wànshèng Gōngzhǔ*), the **Nine-Headed Prince** (*Jiǔtóu fùmǎ*), and the **Nine-Leaved Spirit Mushroom** (*Jiǔyè Língzhī*)—all revealing the **Sage’s self-assertion** (*Sèngzì xióng*), **endless deliberations** (*wànlǜ duōsī*), **searching the heavens and the earth** (*jí dì sōutiān*), and **comprehensive scrutiny** (*wúbù zhōudào*). Yet within their own minds, they **flounder in doubt** (*bēnbēn bōbō*), **add to the suffering of the kalpas** (*tiānzǎ jiéjié*), and remain **utterly without certainty** (*quánwú dìngzhǔn*).",

Now, the Son-in-Law wields the Moon-Crescent Claw—this is the **partial light of the hooked moon**, unable to discern the Heavenly Equal Great Sage, yet he **plunders treasures and misperceives the sacred mountain**, wrongly taking the **restraint of the eyes** as an injury to his own.\n\nThe Wayfarer spoke: *\"This fiend is utterly devoid of reason! Though I do not accept the king’s favor, you stole his treasures—monks are my kin by shared qi. How could I not aid in clarifying the truth for them?\"* For **establishing virtue** does not arise from gratitude, and **acting in power** is not solely for oneself—**without self, others, or living beings**, this is true clarity.\n\n*\"The Great Sage struck first with a rod, and Eight Rules followed with a spade. That monster has nine heads—all eyes.\"* Yet he cannot **discern the past to know restraint**, nor **look ahead to understand warning**; though his eyes are many, what good are they?\n\n*\"Its true form was revealed—utterly ferocious.\"* Eight Rules asked: *\"What blood and qi have spawned this beast?\"* The Dao states: *\"Birds are beasts.\"* Though birds have two wings and beasts four legs, how can they be said to be the same? *The Rites* say: *\"The gibbon can speak, yet it is not separate from birds and beasts.\"* Thus, beasts include those that speak. This nine-headed creature—what beast is it? Birds that speak, beasts that speak—this describes something **far beyond human kind**, beyond what a single bird or beast could name.\n\n*\"The monster spread its wings and flew askew, then from its midsection stretched another head, biting off Eight Rules.\"* It mimics **glimpsing obliquely, listening wildly, and biting madly**—completely contrary to the **\"Four Avoidances\"**, yet unaware of restraint, arrogantly claiming might.\n\n*\"The Wayfarer transformed into a crab, biting through the rope to rescue Eight Rules; then using a hidden-body technique, he stole the spade and passed it to Eight Rules.\"* The crab—**dissolving, scattering difficulty**. Hidden—**concealing, the aperture of revelation**. This is **liberation from entanglement**, guiding the nature of restraint to **stealthy action**.\n\n*\"Eight Rules charged into the palace, smashing gates and vessels, startling the old and young.\"* This is the **vigorous effort to eliminate the old and birth the new**. *\"The Wayfarer suddenly saw the pursuit of Eight Rules and, midair, trod upon clouds and mist, striking the old dragon’s head to smithereens.\"* This is **clear-eyed and swift-handed**, seizing the thief’s heart with the **unmatched method of one overcoming ten thousand**. Xue Wenqing said: *\"Private desires have long disturbed my heart—now I must decisively sever them all to preserve my serene, pure essence.\"* Here, one strike slays the old dragon of myriad saints, and the **Emerald Pool is no longer muddied by chaotic stones**.\n\nYet the old dragon of myriad saints acted without wisdom, **drowned in greed**. Though it possessed countless principles yet failed to discern right from wrong, though named \"myriad saints,\" it was truly **a thief many times over**. To kill the thief’s heart—**easy to destroy**. But the nine-headed demon, seeing much yet acting as a thief, **relying on its cunning**—though called \"nine-headed,\" it is truly **ten evils**. With many thieves, its evil is hard to eradicate. Thus, **a great heavenly decree must be issued**, like the **autumn’s stern killing of all things**, to punish and renew.\n\n*\"The Wayfarer suddenly heard howling winds and grim mists—closer inspection revealed the Second Prince manifesting with the Seven Sacred Brothers.\"* Two—**a pair**; seven—**the number of minor yin**, the time of autumn. *The Daoist Canon Song* says: *\"The White Emperor moves qi, the Dao is renewed.\"* This is the **great hour for eliminating evil**, a **mighty strategy**, hence: *\"This is a grand opportunity.\"*\n\nAutumn’s qi kills, yet **Heaven’s benevolent heart operates within it—life within death**. Grass and trees wither and dissolve, yet all treasures mature. This is **Heaven’s punishment**, exterminating the stubborn, purifying the people’s resolve, as the virtuous uphold righteousness, **cutting off desires and cultivating virtue**—all paths to **cleansing and renewal**. The Dao values **self-knowledge and repentance**, only then gaining salvation. The Great Sage, having *\"once been subdued and disliking confrontation,\"* knew repentance.\n\n*\"Eight Rules requested the True Lord to halt, and with the Great Sage, they reminiscenced in the Second Prince’s camp through the night, awaiting dawn to battle.\"* This holds the meaning of **Ji Gong’s triple kindness and quadruple virtue**, waiting until morning.\n\nWhy did Eight Rules slaughter the dragon’s offspring, why did the hound bite off one of the nine-headed beast’s heads, yet the monster escape unharmed? Because **the wicked seed was fully uprooted**, the **den of the great rebel pacified**; killing one to **warn a hundred**, leaving open the door for self-renewal. The leader’s head must be struck—**to set an example**; some thieves may be pardoned—**to show utmost mercy**. *\"Even now, a nine-headed remnant drips blood,\"*—**executing fully to satisfy the moment is not as effective as prolonged punishment to warn the ages**. The hound’s growl from its jaws **declares judgment to clear the guilty**.\n\nStele, the ninth month’s hexagram, **hides treasure in the fire storehouse**. The scholar must **sever desires and cultivate sincerity**, **severely reproach oneself**, establishing **virtue, deeds, and words**, preserving the **few and rare** to differ from beasts—**thus**.\n\n*\"The Wayfarer transformed into the Son-in-Law’s form, reclaiming the two treasure chests,\"*—**turning evil into truth, gaining two from one**. *\"Eight Rules pounced on the princess, producing the dragon widow, and left her in the tower,\"*—**restraining the demon’s allure while revealing its maternal heart, abandoning abandonment to preserve benevolence**. *\"The king uncovered the indestructible relics and obtained the heavenly life-granting grass,\"*—**resolving grievances, cherishing virtue, illuminating the obscure and clarifying the mysterious**.",

It borrows the **Wood Immortal’s** Hermitage discussion of poetry to encompass **all** who speak of the **Way**, from ancient times to now—**all** are thorns, **none** escape like this **poetic discourse**.\n\nThe *Nanhua* (*Zhuangzi*) says:\n*\"Lost in the radiant, lost in the radiant—it does not harm my path;\nRetreating from the crooked, retreating from the crooked—it does not harm my feet.\"*\n**This is the pain of thorns** filling the way ahead.\n\nI **do not avoid** the **thorny** reputation—\nI **borrow** the **Heavenly Pound’s** strength (*Tiān Pēng*)—\nAnd **unify** the discourse: **All** grand writings and splendid phrases, adorned with **eloquence** and **rich imagery**, profound yet stirring, **exquisitely refined** and **unparalleled**—\nSome **deliberately** craft obscurity to boast of **depth** and **mystery**;\nSome **recklessly** speak against taboos to display **talent** and **emotion**;\nSome **eloquently** argue with **endless twists**, rolling forth ceaselessly to **enrich debate**.\n\nYet **truly**, those who **do not connect** their words to **self-cultivation, heart, nature, and life’s essence**—**all** are thorns!\nNot only this—**all** who write books and speak of **mystery**, **emptiness**, yet **cannot embody the Way** with **personal practice**, merely **wielding pens** and **playing with words**, repeating **heard teachings** and **rumored sayings**—though they **utter all** the **marvels of the Way**, worthy of **emulation** and **transmission**, it is but **parroted cleverness**, **mocking reverence**, all like the **Wood Immortal’s** poetic discourse—**the most severe thorns**!\n\nHeaven **born** the **three teachings’** sages, each **guiding the world** with **divided heads**—\nYet their **origins** all stem from the **Dao of the Yellow River, Luo River, the Supreme Ultimate, and Yin-Yang’s creative transformation**.\nLater generations, **Daoist, Buddhist, and Chan schools**, split into **sects and factions**, **endless schemes** emerging—\nThey **compete** in **discourse**, **flaunting interpretations**, **mutually slandering**—**all** are thorns **within thorns**!\n\nThe **Confucian teaching** upholds **central harmony and singularity**, **unimpeded fairness**—\n*\"Citizens as one’s kin, all things as one’s companion\"*—\n**This is the most fitting and unchanging principle**,\n**No different** from **preserving the Middle, attaining steadfast wisdom**—\n**Desireless yet with desire, selfless yet with self**—\nHow **diverse** is this from **Mencius’** *\"Cultivating the Qi\"*?\n\nYet **Confucius** praised **the Yellow Dragon** (*Yóu Lóng*), saying:\n*\"In the West, a sage will arise!\"*\nLater generations **clung** to **textual details**, unable to **embody and

**unrecognizing**;\nThey **must oppose** *\"True Emptiness\"* (*Zhēnkōng*),\n**Excluding** **Zi Si’s** *\"self-sincerity\"* yet **remaining silent**.\n\n**To debate principles**, why **quibble over words**?\nThey **must deliberately** reject and **denigrate**,\nClaiming **defense of the Sage’s Way**,\nYet **what of** *\"unimpeded fairness\"*?\nIs this not **severing thorns** while **thorns** **pierce** the breast **most severely**?\n\nAccording to the *Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon* (*Huángdì Nèi Zhuàn*):\nThe **Daoist teaching** began with **Emperor of Primordial Beginnings** (*Yuānshǐ Tiānwáng*),\n**Opening** the **chaotic void**, **establishing** the **three powers** (*sān cái*),\n**Transforming** to **generate** the **ten thousand things**—\nTill the **Zhou Dynasty**, when **Laozi** transmitted the *Dao De Jing* (*Moral Teachings*) in **five thousand words**.\n\nAccording to the *Book of Zhou* (*Zhōushū*):\nThe **Confucian teaching** began with the **Yellow Emperor**,\nWho **commanded** **Cangxu** to **create script**, beginning **writing and contracts**—\nTill the **twenty-eighth year of King Jing of Zhou**, when **Confucius** was born,\nAnd **proclaimed** its **teachings**.\n\nAccording to **Emperor Wu of Liang’s** *Buddhist Lineage* (*Fó Tǒng*):\nThe **Buddha** was born in **Eastern India**,\nAt the time of **King Zhuang of Zhou’s** ninth year,\nOn the **eighth day of the fourth month**—\nFrom **Emperor Ming of Han’s** *Yongping* eighth year,\nThe **Dharma** began to **enter China** and **prosper**.\n\nIt has been **investigated** that the people of **Eastern India** are **naturally robust**, fond of **battle and slaughter**,\nConsidering **death in war** as **auspicious**, **peaceful passing** as **inauspicious**.\n**Laozi**, upon leaving **Hangu Pass**,\n**Transformed** the **Floating Image** (*Fútú*) **method**,\nOrdering **internal and external purification**, **no harm to the body**,\nAnd naming it **\"Floating Image\"** (*Fútú*).\n\nIn the **ninth year of King Zhuang of Zhou**, on the **eighth day of the fourth month**,\nThe **fixed stars** vanished, **falling like rain**—\nThat night, **Shakyamuni Buddha** was born,\nCapable of **practicing** **Bo Yang’s** **Dao** (*i.e., Laozi’s teachings*),\nAnd the people **followed** him, calling him **\"Buddha\"** (*Fó*).\n\n**Buddha** is what China calls **\"God\"** (*Shén*),\nThe next rank is **\"Bodhisattva\"** (*Púsà*).\nHis realm **teemed with life**, **no widows, orphans, or lonely souls**—\nThus, people **wished to be

The former harms itself and others in a minor way; this one harms others to the point of **destroying life and extinguishing nature**, even using **scholarship** to slaughter the **future generations of the world**—thus, it is the **great calamity**!\n\n*\"The **Tripitaka Master** has escaped the **thorny entanglements** of the **Ugly Peak**, now gazing upon lofty mountains that touch the **Heavenly realm**.

      "translated_text": "「“**Gong** (鐙) and “**Nao** (挠)” share the same meaning. Zhuangzi said, *“Heaven generates all things, none sufficient to **nao** (挠) the heart”*—meaning one must remain unyielding in their **Dao/Way** and never bend to falsehood.\n\nThe hearts of the **petty** are crooked, yielding to desires, steadfast yet unmovable, clinging to evil until the end, obstinate in their delusions, utterly dark with no glimmer of insight. This is what is called *“the lowest of the low cannot be swayed”*—like a **golden gong** (金鐙) sealed tight, unable to be pried open or emit a sound. Thus, the **pilgrims** were trapped inside it, in a black void from which they could not escape. Its **power** could even **spread and penetrate** like molten gold, rising to the high or sinking to the low, expertly sealing off all exits. So when I stood in the **high**, it used the **high** to constrain me, and I could not move; when I stood in the **low**, it used the **low** to constrain me, and I could not move. It was all because of its **obdurate, unyielding heart**—no crevice or opening to allow a person to turn or shift.\n\n*\"The **pilgrim** became **immovable like a drill**, the **minor demons**’ **power** too weak to **lift** it; the **Jade Emperor** dispatched the **Twenty-Eight Constellations** with spears, swords, knives, and axes—**bearing, lifting, prying, and levering**—yet the **golden gong** remained **coldly unmoved**.\"* This is precisely *“Heaven generates all things, none sufficient to **nao** (挠) the heart”*—its **shackles** were deep, its **fortress** unbreakable.\n\nThe **Golden-Headed Dragon** (亢金龙) said: *“Gazing upon this treasure, it must surely be a **wish-fulfilling** object.”* Its **black heart** mirrored its **wicked intentions**, yet its **authority and magical power** were enough to **ensnare** beings.\n\nIf a **gentleman** (君子) were unluckily trapped, he must **hold fast to the principle of moderation and rectitude**, **borrowing the strength of the Monkey and the Ox** (猿引犄角) to escape calamity, **concealing his light and entering its darkness** (韬其明而就其暗). Otherwise, none would avoid **disintegration of limbs** or **loss of life**.\n\nThen the **Golden-Headed Dragon** transformed its horn into a **needle-sharp tip**, sliding it along the **seam of the gong** (钹口合缝), using a **force of a thousand pounds** before it could pierce through.\n\nThe *“seam”* (合缝) refers to the **central junction** of the two **gongs**, where their **mouths** open and close. The *“Golden-Headed”* (亢) is neither **flattery** nor **arrogance**, but rather **balanced strength**—neither lowly nor lofty—speaking of **upholding the principle of moderation**, yet its **power surpasses its form**, its **mind as fine as a hair**.\n\n*\"The **pilgrim** drilled the **seam** with its horn tip; its body shrank to the size of a **mustard seed**, crouching within the hole to emerge.\"* This is the **Dao/Way of subtle adaptability and emptiness**, **meticulous research**, **not boasting of its own abilities**, and **relying on the horn**—**discerning the openings within openings**, **treading beyond the heavens** (踏破天外天).\n\n*\"It drew out the **Golden Hoop Staff**, smashing the **golden gong**.\"* With one enlightenment, a thousand illusions dissolved; with one defeat, the **Four Great Elements** were shattered like **minced meat**. How could one rely on the **petty’s Dao/Way**?

Hence, there was the **Post-Heaven Bag** (后天袋) as the **greatest calamity**.\n\nThe **demon** declared: *“This place is called **Little Western Heaven** (小西天), for I have attained the **true fruit** (正果), and Heaven bestows upon me this **treasure-hall and precious pavilion**.”* It **claimed to be the **Yellow-Browed Old Buddha** (黄眉老佛), **displaying its powers** to **wager a bet and challenge**, vowing to *“beat you all to death, then go to the **Tathāgata** to fetch scriptures—**the fruit is truly mine!**”* It sought to **make itself the ancestor**, **arrogantly inflating its own greatness**, yet it knew not that it was a **petty thief**, **usurping false titles**.\n\n*\"During the battle, the old demon untied its **old white cloth sack** (旧白布搭儿) and **bundled up all the holy ones** (圣众) within it.\"* Its **rageful heart** surged, and it **dragged many into its net**.\n\n*\"Each was bound tightly, no distinction between good and evil—all were cast to the ground.\"* It sought to **entrap them in its prisons**.\n\nThe **Buddha-Dharma** knows **no discrimination**, **no division between good and evil**—it is the **universal love**.

This *“no division between good and evil”* is **evil itself**, hence it is a **false Buddha**.\n\nThe **pilgrim** first **freed itself**, then **its Master**, then **Eight Rules** and **Sha Wujing**, then the **Twenty-Eight Constellations** and the **Five Directions’ Jie Di**, then **its horse**, and finally **retrieved its baggage**.

Is this not an unnecessary detour, stumbling and faltering in vain?\n\nAlas! The author’s profound discourse and grand writings on the Way and human hearts are buried in obscurity. The two Immortal Ancestors—one pacifying the Northern realm, the other subduing the *Sizhou* waters—both manifested their powers through taming floods. Yet fierce beasts, venomous dragons, water spirits, and all manner of tortoises, serpents, and dragon generals were not only conquered but also *put to use* by them. Thus, even floods and ferocious beasts are easier to tame.\n\nTracing their origin from birth to enlightenment, recounting their might in subduing divine beings and mastering supernatural abilities—without these two Ancestors, none could have calmed the chaos. Yet today, not only can they not calm the chaos, but the very generals of the gods are *stripped away* and seized—this is the ultimate evil of false teachings, far worse than floods and ferocious beasts! How could one not weep bitterly at this sight?\n\n*\"The Wanderer, weeping before the Functionary, said:*\n‘Now I am ashamed to ascend the Celestial Palace, humiliated to stand before the Southern Seas. I dread to ask the Buddha of the origins, and am distressed to behold the Jade Image of the Tathāgata.\nThose who were seized—true *Zhenwu* tortoises, serpents, and the Five Dragons—have left me no means to seek salvation. What am I to do?’\n\nAh, wondrous Immortal Master! Does the Wanderer truly grieve, fear, or feel shame and remorse, shedding tears as such? The deeper sorrow lies in the lamentation that the Heavenly Immortals and the Buddha’s teachings were established to *save the world and deliver from calamity*, yet scholars today *exploit these teachings to bring harm to the world*, seizing their truth while indulging in falsehoods. Even the Bodhisattvas and Tathāgatas have no recourse.\n\nWhen one reflects on their origins and contemplates their form, the anguish becomes unbearable. How can one endure to see such corruption again?\n\nThe sages left their teachings to *guide the wise and transform the ignorant*, to cultivate the body and mind for the benefit of all beings. Yet today, their words are *plundered to gratify desires*, their principles *stolen to nurture deceit*.\nFloods can be tamed, but this false tide cannot; ferocious beasts can be subdued, but this venom cannot.\nIf the *Nishan* and *Sizhou* were to arise today, they would surely *harmonize with the false teachings of Wudang and Sizhou* and find no means to counter them.\n\nAlas! The Wanderer, as a disciple of the Buddha, fears to behold the Tathāgata; yet if the Wanderer were a Confucian scholar, he would be ashamed to ascend the *Xingtan* platform, distressed to hear the *Biyu* bell tolling.\n\nIt is not merely a matter of sorrowful lamentation, but rather an urgent warning against the severity of false teachings as a calamity.\n\nThat demon, upon seeing the tortoise, serpent, and dragon generals, raged and said:\n*“What power do these beings possess?”*\nThe Four Generals of the Prince of *Taizi* laughed and replied:\n*“What means do you have? You can only bully the water monsters of the Huai River.”*\nIn their unbridled rage and joy, they defile the gods and mock the sages, winning battle after battle, yet all are *seized and stripped away*—how can their harm not surpass that of floods and ferocious beasts?\n\nAt this dire and pitiful moment, only the foremost Buddha of the *Extreme Bliss Realm* can open His laughter, uphold the teachings of the world, and point to the true hearts of heaven, earth, and humanity—urging each person to *plant seeds of sincerity* in the fundamental nature, to *strive earnestly for genuine return*, and to *banish external false teachings*, seeking instead the already *shattered gold* of their original truth. This is the true *pillar to steady the raging waves*, the divine staff to crush the venom.\n\nSuddenly, the Wanderer sees *Maitreya* descend, pointing to the *post-heaven sack* as the *sowing sack for humanity*—the foundation of *benevolent heart* and *benevolent governance*, encompassing all phenomena of heaven and earth. It is not something to be *stolen and used to deceive the ruler or mislead the world*.\nThe *Rangyabar* (狼牙棒) is the *striking mallet of the cosmic drum*—a sacred instrument to *awaken the customs and rouse the deluded*, enlightening the wise, the foolish, the virtuous, and the unprincipled. It is not to be *wielded to harm others or bring suffering to the multitude*.\n\nThe way to rectify this is to *pursue sincerity*;\nthe way to pursue sincerity is as clear as *planting melons*.」",

      "translated_text": "The *sowing of melons yields melons*—the principle of planting roots and cultivating truth. *Maitreya* sows a field of melons and fruits to tempt their thirsty cravings, demonstrating the way to abandon superficiality and embrace reality. The method of action must first restrain and regulate, suppressing their old cunning.\n\nWrite the character **\"restraint\"** (禁) upon the palm, wield it in the hand so that no falsehoods, extravagance, ostentation, or avarice may arise. Attack and retreat in turn. Release restraint and use inducement, gradually drawing them near to truth, then seizing the opportunity to enlighten them; penetrate their core, making them aware of the critical bond between life and *Dao*, thereby subduing them and capturing their hearts. This is the great *pillar to steady the raging waves*’ technique of transforming the melon within, seizing the entrails, and striking at the heart to awaken their minds.\n\nThat demon then cries out, *\"Master, spare my life!\"*—only then does it recognize that life and *Dao* are the most precious of treasures, and the true Master is revealed. Afterward, the *post-heaven sack* and the *striking mallet of the cosmic drum* cannot be wielded in reverse, to harm the world.\n\nEating the melon’s reality reveals that true learning lies in the *Dao* of life; entering the *sack of Maitreya* reveals that the *sack of the Way* is rooted in one’s own self. Scattered fragments of truth must be gathered into unity; old habits, once abandoned, must be returned to their original source.\n\nThe Buddha and the Patriarchs return to *Extreme Bliss* (极乐), the gods each resume their proper stations, the disciples escape calamity and gain freedom, abandoning the *Small Thunder Sound* (小雷音) for the *Great Thunder Sound* (大雷音)—all this is the pursuit of the fundamental truth. Alas! The *yellow-browed* (黄眉) ones borrow the *sack of Maitreya*, which encompasses all phenomena, to become the *abyss of greed* that devours all beings. How tragic! Yet fortunately, the reality of the melon is obtained to reclaim them.\n\nNow, among the *Confucian, Buddhist, and Daoist* schools, many *yellow-browed* ones wield the *cosmic drum* and the *sack* together. How can one expect the *Wanderer* to endure such widespread planting of *Eastern Ling* (东陵) and the burden of repeated action?\n\n**The Sixty-Seventh Chapter: Rescuing the Steadfast *Dharma-nature* of the *Tālā* (驼罗) Hermit, Freeing the Pure *Dao-heart* from Defilement**\n\nThe text states: *\"This book reveals that great concealment does not prevent dwelling in the marketplace, but one must not be corrupted by market vices; detachment from dust does not prevent entering dust, but one must not be stained by worldly traces.\"* The false *immortals* of the *Wood Immortal Hermitage* (木仙庵) and the pseudo-*Buddhas* of the *Small Thunder Sound* (小雷音), though they appear to have devised their own methods, seem to avoid the world’s clamor and shun the dust—yet they are not the true essence of great concealment.\n\nAt the beginning, the *Three Treasures* (三藏) said, *\"Let us seek lodging along that path?\"* The Wanderer replied, *\"The lodging lies ahead.\"* These words teach one to accept whatever arises and not to precalculate.\n\nThe *Immortal Master* (仙师) thus set forth the analogy of *sparse persimmons* (稀柿) and *extreme filth* (极污). The persimmon, once fallen, has just left the \"wood\" (木) to become the \"market\" (市). The *Seven Emotions* (七情) are likened to the seven passions of man. Love and attachment are hard to sever, yet they ultimately lead to poisonous harm. Accumulated over time, they become defilement; deep-rooted obstacles become mountains. The *yin-qi* (阴气) breeds into a *serpent’s den* (蟒穴), and the *Kāngzāng* (康庄) path transforms into the *Swine’s Way* (豕途). This is the origin of the *Tālā* Hermit’s *long serpent* (长蛇) that devours people, and the *Seven Emotions Mountain* (七绝山) that blocks the road like a *walled-off boar* (封豕).\n\n*\"Tālā\"* (驼罗) is the *Sanskrit* term for *Tāla* (陀罗净土), the *Pure Land*. *\"Five hundred or more households\"* (共有五百多家) refers to the *Arhats* (罗汉), those who dwell there. The *Buddhist canon* (释典) names them *\"Arahat\"* (阿罗汉), meaning those who have extinguished all passions, capable of receiving universal offerings, untouched by the three realms, far from all evil, and enjoying pure *Dharma-nature* (禅性稳). Yet now, dwelling beside the *sparse persimmons*, they suffer continuous attacks by serpentine demons, their livestock devoured, their men and women in fear and peril—this is the *Dharma-nature* (性) of a neighbor to a *serpent’s den* (蛇窟), the *Pure Land* (净土) turned into a *field of slander* (舌场). How precarious it is, like one drowning or burning, needing urgent rescue!\n\nOnly one with great wisdom and great *pillar to steady the raging waves*’ power, such as the *Wanderer* (孙行者), can easily dispel and drive away such calamities, bringing peace to the world. Could those ordinary monks who rot like *spoiled melons* (烂西瓜) or those ordinary Daoists who are *boiled chickens* (落汤鸡) truly stabilize the *Dharma-nature* (禅性) and purify the *Dao-heart* (道心)?\n\nOnly the Wanderer’s supreme methods can be relied upon to shoulder this burden—no other can be summoned. Yet if one does not purify oneself and minimize attachments, or if one lingers over gold, silver, or fields, then it is greed and the pursuit of profit, consorting with the market’s vices. Even if one unites in removing harm, it remains an attack by one demon against another—never to be allowed.\n\nThus, the Wanderer appears to teach and demonstrates that, though he values gold and silver, he does not indulge in market corruption; though he sees fields, he does not fish with the market’s tricks. All this is but the accumulation of virtue.\n\nThe market’s heart is full of deceitful schemes, yet it resembles a serpent. The *Dao* scriptures say, *\"The serpent of passions sleeps in your heart\"*—this is it. Its accumulated habits are such that it seizes cattle and horses, it seizes chickens and geese, it seizes men and women—regardless of size or status, it is well-practiced in devouring them. Its eyes hang like twin torches, revealing hidden profits in the dark; its tongue dances like double hooks, swiftly blocking and misleading on either side. Only until dawn, when the *heavenly heart* (天心) resets, does it hesitate and conceal itself, yet its head and tail remain exposed, unable to escape the discerning gaze of the wise.\n\nWhen its *qi* (气) is strong, the *soft-shafted spear* (软柄枪) displays boundless crafty tricks; when its path is exhausted, the *great mouth* (巨口) swiftly swallows all in an instant. Ah! How fearsome it is!",

It is not something to be *stolen and used to deceive the ruler or mislead the world*.\nThe *Rangyabar* (狼牙棒) is the *striking mallet of the cosmic drum*—a sacred instrument to *awaken the customs and rouse the deluded*, enlightening the wise, the foolish, the virtuous, and the unprincipled. It is not to be *wielded to harm others or bring suffering to the multitude*.\n\nThe way to rectify this is to *pursue sincerity*;\nthe way to pursue sincerity is as clear as *planting melons*.」",

mere things;\nstillness within movement, movement within stillness—this is the spirit.\n\nAgain it says:\n*\"‘Wine is a fine friend, flowers a companion;\nin the flower streets and willow lanes, seek

      "translated_text": "「Careful calculation reveals that the few who escape being boiled and devoured by the myriad demons are indeed rare.\n\nSpeaking of the hot springs’ origin, it traces back to Hou Yi’s shooting down the sun—nine arrows struck, one remained—symbolizing the *\"yin-path’s aversion to the nine-one\"* [i.e., the excess of yin]. Speaking of the women stripping and bathing, it vividly depicts the alluring beauty that melts the soul.\n\nThose starved for lust, like hungry vultures, will spread their wings and claws, snatch away clothing, and pay no heed to modesty. Those obsessed with seduction, like loach spirits, will slither and probe, their legs and groins writhing, while abandoning their own forms.\n\nThe practitioner and Eight Rules [Eight Precepts]—both demonstrate this in person, revealing their true appearances. Snatching clothing and probing groins are all symbols of seduction and plunder.\n\nWhen qi is strong, *\"they are crude and heavy, unaware of cherishing jade or loving fragrance.\"* When disaster strikes, their entire body is injured, yet they stumble left and right like one struck by blows. *\"Numb limbs, weak legs, dizzying head, blurred vision—even crawling is impossible, only groaning on the ground\"*—these are real consequences. How could such things not end in death? *\"The seven women laugh as they return to their old chamber, while Eight Rules keeps tumbling\"*—they gain nothing from others but harm themselves.\n\nThe *Yin-Shu Jing* [Classic of the Mysterious Pivot] states: *\"Fire is born from wood; when disaster arises, it will surely overcome.\"* This is exactly what is meant.\n\nMoreover, yin manifestations are manifold—some cling to you like a shadow, yet are not of your true kind. Not only can they not nourish the body to form the elixir, but they will turn the entire body into poison. Their offspring—*dry children, ants, clams, spotted creatures, grasshoppers, wax moths, and dragonflies*—will swarm over the limbs, shifting and transforming endlessly, beyond all cure.\n\nEven with medicines like *huang* [yellow], *ma* [hemp], *□* [a missing character, possibly *wu* 鸟戎, \"martial bird\"], *bai* [white], *diao* [falcon], *yu* [fish], and *yao* [hawk], it is already too late—this serves as a profound warning.\n\n*Zhuangzi* says: *\"I guard my form and forget my body, appearing in murky waters while lost in clear depths.\"* I say: *\"If one forgets form while seducing women, lost in clear depths while gazing into murky waters.\"* Such heretical practices must be burned away with fire.\n\n**Chapter 73: Resentment from the Past Brings Poisonous Disaster; The Heart-Master’s Misfortune Luckily Breaks the Light**\n\nMaster Wu Yi said: The earlier text spoke of solitary cultivation gone wrong, leading to schemes of seduction. Now, it shifts from seduction’s folly to the delusion of alchemical refining. All are the work of mistaken speculation by the recognizing mind.\n\nThough they claim to see with ten thousand eyes, believing they’ve spread the Heavenly Net and Earthly Web, their vision extends no further than an inch—blindly practicing, blindly refining. How could they know the subtlety of true yin and yang? It is supremely simple, effortlessly pure, and effortlessly one—boundless in its greatness, yet without internal limits. It is found in daily life, naturally at ease, effortlessly grasped, and unfathomably subtle.\n\nTo refine cinnabar, mercury, and black lead—substances of foreign essence—is to brew poison and invite death. There is no possibility of longevity or transcendence.\n\nPure Yang Master said:\n*\"Alas for Zhang the Prefect of Jiangzhou,\nwho took medicine and lost his sight—his spirit withered.\nHe did not know the True Elixir has no substance—\nto swallow gold and stone is sheer folly!\"*\n\nZi Yang Master said:\n*\"Do not refine the Three Yellows or Four Spirits,\nfor seeking herbs is not the True Way.\nIf one seeks the true lead and mercury,\nthey are not common sand or quicksilver.\"*\n\nBai Juyi said:\n*\"Before Dongyue’s tomb, new graves rise,\nAt Beimang’s mound, the dead lie.\nI’ve heard of those who erred in their elixirs,\nobsessed with the art of eternal life.\"*\n\nThe *Biography of Wei Fu* states:\n*\"Once, one who twice drank the elixir of immortality was found dead in his coffin.\nAnother, after taking a single dose of the knife-elixir, rotted in his grave.\nLu Pi Gong swallowed the Jade Flower, yet worms crawled from his mouth.\nJia Ji swallowed the Golden Elixir, and the stench reached a hundred li.\nHuangdi melted nine tripods on Jing Mountain, yet his tomb remains on Qiao Ridge.\nLi Yu took Cloud-Dispersing Pills to ascend in secret, yet his head and feet were found apart.\nMo Di drank the Rainbow Elixir and drowned himself in water.\nNing Sheng swallowed the Stone Marrow and threw himself into fire.\nWu Guang chopped chives to enter a cold spring;\nXiang Cheng inhaled qi, yet his stomach and intestines rotted away.\"*\n\nAll these prove that alchemical refining and ingestion are not noble pursuits—they are not the Great Dao of natural transformation. These are the golden needles of this very text.\n\nThe *Daozang Song* [Song of the Daoist Canon] says:\n*\"Seeing those who learn Daoism along the streams,\ntheir paths billow with fiery smoke.\nThey no longer await the sun’s light,\nnor do they preserve the essence of yin.\"*\n\nIt laments the deceptive paths of alchemy,\nblocking the natural source of life.\nIt is like seeking to form a fetus from external substances,\nor hoping to bear fruit by gathering flowers—\nsuch attempts are doomed to fail.\n\nThe Daoist master of Huanghua Guan refined mercury and lead.\nOn the gate of his observatory hung a plaque proclaiming *\"Yellow Sprouts\"* and *\"Qixia Flowers\"*—\nsitting and concocting pills, these are the very marks of a practitioner,\nyet they hide their malevolent intentions.\n\nThe Daoist said: *\"This medicine must not be given to yin-people.\"*\nThey know that humans belong to yin,\nyet they fail to see that they themselves are the poison within yin.\n\nThese charlatans, under the guise of secret arts,\ndeaf, blind, and ignorant, covet wealth and seduce the greedy.\nThey will not rest until flesh and marrow are exhausted—\nonly then will their insatiable hunger be sated.\n\nThe seven demons’ complaints—first stealing clothes, then committing deceit—\nare the everyday grievances of their sect.\nThose who harm others now turn to accuse them,\nstill clinging to the flesh of others while claiming others harm themselves.\n\n*\"Fetching the ladder to climb the rafters,\nbringing down the medicine.\"*\nThe medicine has been stored for a long time,\nintended solely to poison others.\nThey scrape the light and pure substance from the cauldron—\nthis is what alchemists call *\"plucking feathers to ascend as a treasure.\"*\n\nThe Daoist said: *\"My treasure, if given to a commoner,\nwould kill them with just a grain—\nonce swallowed, death is certain.\"*",

said:\n*\"From qi’s transformation comes the name Dao.\"*\nThus, it is already clear that the Dao belongs to Yin-Yang,\nnot to the heart—\nthough the heart is the master of piercing its subtleties and marvels.\n\n*\"The Great Sage transforms into a tiny wind-drilling insect,\nentering the Lion’s Mane Cave\"*—\nthis is the transformation of softness and weakness,\nseeking with an empty heart.\n\n*\"Transforming into a fly\"*—\nthe ultimate of softness and weakness.\n\nStartling the old demon,\nunaware it laughs,\nits careless jest reveals its flaw—\nhow else could it be bound by the treasure bottle?\n\nThe treasure bottle unites Yin-Yang qi,\nwater and fire in primal chaos,\nencompassing spirit and vitality—\nnothing escapes its transformation.\n\nIn the human body, it is the root of the navel’s central yellow breath,\nthe alchemical *\"play of the mysterious female,\"*\nwhere spirit is condensed and the path is sealed—\nthe so-called *\"white jade linked rings.\"*\n\nCentral in position,\nit contains the seven treasures, eight trigrams, and twenty-four qi—\nnothing is excluded.\n\nThe body mirrors heaven and earth,\nand this orifice symbolizes the Supreme Ultimate—\nno duality exists.\n\nYet this, when followed correctly, becomes the marvel of human perfection;\nwhen reversed, it becomes the marvel of elixir cultivation.\n\nStudents of the Dao reach this point,\nbewildered and unable to probe—\nonly to retreat in despair.\n\nOnly by penetrating its inner workings\ndoes one realize that the alchemical method is but this—\nwith only internal and external, correct and inverted, distinctions.\n\nYet how foolish to cling to this treasure bottle,\nclaiming *\"essence begets qi, qi begets spirit,\"*\ncondensing spirit here, fixing intent to seal it—\nonly to hasten one’s own transformation!\n\nThe old demon says:\n*\"Monkey, this time you enter my treasure bottle—\nno more thoughts of the Western Path.\"*\n\nThe immortal sage’s words here awaken many spring dreams.\n*\"Sealed within the bottle\"*—\ncondensing spirit at the qi-orifice,\nthe symbol of refining essence into qi.\n*\"Closing breath, forgetting speech\"*—\nsilent and

As for **Tang Seng**, his mind already lost, how could he not be ensnared by the demon and dragged into the **Hollow Mountain**, into the **Bottomless Pit**?\n\nThe demon excels in its deceptive allure—its flower-footed illusion, empty-flight lures—none can escape its schemes. Even the **Wise Monkey**, struck by two demonic breaths, dodged only to fall into its trap. How much more so **Tang Seng**, tender and pitying, unaware of danger, suddenly plunged into ruin—this was his inevitable fate.\n\nThis was the result of **Tang Seng’s** left-foot misstep over a grain of rice, while the demon, in turn, shed its flowered shoe. I moved with my left, and it met me with its left—left against left—yet a single step’s error led to total ruin. As the saying goes: *\"A hair’s breadth difference leads to a thousand-li mistake.\"*\n\nAt that moment, his mind and spirit were in disarray, his homeland unsettled, chaos reigning without direction. Only now did he truly grasp the demon’s true menace.\n\nEarlier, **Tang Seng** had merely thought of sending a letter home to the East, yet his body had not yet moved. Now, his body itself turns back eastward—how could the three disciples fail to follow suit?\n\nFor the demon originally arose from the **Black Pine Grove**, suddenly appearing, and must still be sought there. Swiftly setting aside distractions, he must now compose himself, renew his resolve, and earnestly seek salvation.\n\nBy uncovering the truth of **Hollow Mountain** and the **Bottomless Pit**, he may learn its whereabouts and act in unison to rescue them—urgent as the wind, swift as the clouds, with no room for delay.\n\nThis very entrapment is a trial that **Dao cultivators** must endure. Without falling into the pit, one does not know how easily one might be ensnared. Without falling, one does not grasp the depth of its abyss. Who would have known the **Hollow Mountain’s** bottomless depths, had he not experienced it firsthand?\n\nThus, the demon’s **Hollow Mountain** and **Bottomless Pit** are the very **realized terrain** of **true practice**.\n\nAll illusory forms arise from the spontaneous stirrings of the mind within stillness.\n\nThe land spirit pointed toward *\"true south,\"*—the **Li** trigram above, the **Kan** below. The central line of **Qian** sinks to form **Li**; the central line of **Kun** ascends to form **Kan**. This is the **Kun** yin consuming the **Qian** yang—just as the female demon ensnares the **Elder**.\n\nThe character *\"flower shoe\"* (花鞋) is composed of two *\"people\"* and two *\"earth\"* radicals, with *\"hua\"* (化, transform) and *\"ge\"* (革,革革,革革革,革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革革",

The cunning **flower-shoe demon** slips free from the snare—truly dreadful!\n\nIn the **Eighty-Second Chapter**, *\"The Maid Seeks Yang\"* and *\"The Primordial Spirit Guards the Dao\"*, Master Wu Yi remarked: This passage cleverly uses the *\"Errant Spirit Falls into the Bottomless Pit\"* to stage a **sutra**-like performance, with hidden subtleties at every turn.\n\nThose with innate **Daoist** essence can silently guide their **spirit** and **mind**—the **Penglai** and **Eluyuan** lie before them.\n\nAlas! Though the **Soul Mountain** assembly gathers a thousand **Buddhas**, which one can escape this very place?\n\nWhen **practitioners** reach this juncture, they must swiftly gather their **spirit** and **mind**, resolutely seeking a path beyond. They must devise every means to find an exit.\n\nHere lies a **secret Vajra**—the *\"river-crossing ferry, the ladder to heaven\"*! The **Ancestral Master** dared not reveal it, so it remains concealed within these **nine-nine** cycles, returning to their beginning.\n\nThe **true mechanism** leaps forth, yet is held back—just as **Ziyu** said: *\"The capable follow it,\"* and here it is!\n\nThe *Cansong Contract* states:\n*\"The river maid, most refined and spirit-like,\nEncountering fire, she takes flight, leaving no trace.\nGhosts and dragons hide, none know her whereabouts.\nTo subdue her, yellow sprouts must be the root.\"*\n\nThe annotation reads: *\"Yellow sprouts—i.e., rabbit marrow, the gold within water.\"*\n\nThe **flower-shoe demon** embodies the **Kun** trigram. **Kun** obtains the **Qian** central line to form **Kan**; **Qian** transforms the **Kun** central line to become **Li**. The maid’s pursuit of **Yang** is the natural interplay of **yin** and **yang**.\n\nThose who study the **Dao** must retrieve the **Yang** from within **Kan** and solidify the **Yin** in **Li**, achieving an indestructible **true-gold** body.\n\nYet once **Yang** is ensnared in **Kan**, it is as if one has fallen into the **Bottomless Pit**—how then can one emerge?\n\nFor centuries, those who profane this **sacred text** have failed to grasp what the **Bottomless Pit** truly is—**sin**! **Sin**!\n\nThe **Kan** hexagram is void above and void below—clearly, a mountain hollowed with no bottom.\n\nThe lecture begins with *\"two female demons at the well drawing water.\"* The well is **Kan**; the demons are the **crawfish**. Two **yin** lines are plainly shown.\n\nThen it says: *\"On their heads, they wear a tall, one-foot-two-to-three-inch-high **‘mishu’** (髟狄) knot—quite unfashionable.\"* These two lines reveal the **secret essence** of refining the **gold elixir**—though the **Daoist Master** has exposed it, mortals fail to recognize.\n\nIn **Daoist** practice, one’s **qi** and **nature** must be gentle and yielding—no rigid boundaries. This aligns with **Laozi’s** *\"teeth firm, tongue soft\"* and the **Dao of War**: *\"The virtuous prevail.\"*\n\nThe **practitioner** says: *\"Gentleness conquers all; harshness falters even a step.\"* Again invoking **willow** and **sandalwood** as metaphors, deeply grasping **Laozi’s** meaning.\n\n*\"Two demons come here to draw this **yin-yang** copulating water, setting a pure feast\"*—the emphasis on *\"good\"* reveals that without **yin-yang** union, male remains male, female remains female, and *\"good\"* cannot arise.\n\n*\"Male and female copulate, all things transform and generate.\"* The **Daoist** path is complete.\n\nThe **bewildered**, reading this, mistakenly assume it refers to **sexual alchemy**—the farther they stray, the harder it is to find salvation.\n\nWhen the **practitioner** leaps in, he plunges into *\"a fine place indeed—this is a **Tian** realm of bliss!\"*\n\nYet within, one must grasp it firmly—never *\"lose true Yang, fall into the wheel of rebirth, and never rise again.\"* Swiftly seek an exit; do not forget, for it plainly teaches that **birth** comes from **life**, urging **respect** and **truth-preservation**, and to urgently find the **transcendent** union—never abandoning the original path.\n\n**Tripitaka** says: *\"I’ve forgotten the way in.\"*\n\nThis reminds all to seek the **ultimate cause** of escape from the very path they entered.\n\nThe **practitioner** says: *\"Do not speak of forgetting the way—this cave is strange, not meant for easy entry or exit.

      "translated_text": "The Eighty-Fifth Chapter: The Heart-Monkey Envious of the Wood Mother, the Demon King’s Scheme to Devour Zen\n\nThe Sage said: This chapter—readers may say that the earlier demons were beyond comparison, but this one is merely ordinary, as if hastily written. Yet what seems unremarkable is truly wondrous: what can be thought of is not what should be thought at all.\n\nThe previous section exposed the emptiness of human nature and worldly affairs, revealing all dharmas as void. One must blend with the world, adapting to circumstances—whether square or round—though outwardly responding to events, yet rooted in the boundless luminosity of the heart’s essence. Fearful that others might not perceive this from the heart, the Immortal Master forcefully turns outward to inward, emphasizing the profound intent of *\"The Heart Sutra is not to be sought far away,\"* urging one to recognize this heart and never harbor the slightest obstruction, lest one fall into demonic snares.\n\nFor the Holy Heart is like a mirror-still pool—ever luminous, ever tranquil, ever responsive yet ever still. All uses arise from its singular essence, and its essence never strays from all uses. Thus it is said: *\"The body of wisdom is silent and still, its function radiant and suchness.\"*\n\nYet if even a speck of obstruction arises, the heart’s essence grows murky and clogged, and its outer functions become deceitful—like mist veiling the soul’s faculties, where Zen is swallowed whole, as though dense fog concealed within the transparent layers of the *Lianhuan Cave*, shattering the sky-piercing pillars!\n\nThus the next section is titled: *\"Hidden Mist Mountain, the Broken Peak, the Linked-Ring Cave.\"* The Five Peaks are the celestial pillars; the One Heart is the master of the body. When the peaks collapse, the sky lacks support; when the heart is obscured, the body loses its root. Actions unrooted in the heart become nothing but afflictions—what Zen remains?\n\nZen seeks to dissolve demons; the staff is wielded to subdue them. Yet how does the demon wield the staff and devour Zen? Zen stills but one mind, while the demon traverses the Six Realms. To bind Zen and extinguish dharma is for the demon to govern demons—how can it avoid becoming a gluttonous maw, greedily consuming living Zen?\n\nWhy? Because following desire is not Zen-mind. It splits into precepts, concentration, and wisdom—expanding into the Six Perfections, dispersing into myriad practices. Zen is but one of the Six Perfections—how can it encompass all dharmas? Few escape becoming demonic.\n\nMoreover, Zen-mind is hard to purify, and the golden and wooden essences remain unmelted. How could one then reject all existence and eliminate all dharmas without falling into calculation? If all dharmas are void, it is not that there are no dharmas. The heart gives rise to all dharmas yet does not belong to them. Those who attain it find dharma at their command, verified from the heart, arising as desired—neither identical nor different, neither different nor identical; neither dharma nor non-dharma, neither non-dharma nor non-non-dharma. How could one seek it by clinging to traces?\n\nDharma is like a tuft of hair. External dharmas are like the body’s bearing—without dharma, it is a loss of decorum. The opening lines, spoken by the ministers, plainly state *\"loss of decorum.\"* Yet the subtlety of dharma’s empty nature is beyond those who cling to worldly dharmas. The minister says, *\"I do not know,\"* the king replies, *\"Indeed, you do not know,\"*—each weeping profusely, truly pitiful.\n\nWhen the king repents of killing and the entire kingdom takes refuge, changing *\"destroying dharma\"* to *\"revering dharma,\"* it embodies the principle *\"The Buddha has no fixed form; no abiding birth-mind.\"* For clinging to dharma is to destroy dharma; not clinging to dharma is to revere dharma. Thus sitting in Zen is sitting as Buddha; sitting as Buddha is killing Buddha. Clinging to dharma is fixing the mind; a fixed mind is demonic mind.\n\nThe Elder on horseback joyfully declared, *\"Wukong, this principle is excellent, of great merit.\"* Already, all dharmas return to One—every aspect radiates the Dao’s essence. Sha Wujing immediately continued, *\"Brother...\"*",

Destroying law through law, revering law to attain law—law has no fixed form. Such is its nature.",

      "translated_text": "The Eighty-Sixth Episode: *Mu* Mother Aids in Subduing the Fiend\n*Jin* Father Applies the Dao to Exterminate the Demon\n\n*Wu Yi Zi* said: This continues from the previous section, speaking of the Dao/Way being obscured by *Chan* (meditation).\n\nDue to negligence and deceit, one must diligently awaken and discipline oneself—never allowing the slightest falsehood or pretense—then can one penetrate the inner and outer, and comprehend the interconnected cycles of cause and effect.\n\n*\"Hidden Mist Mountain, the Aiyue Leopard’s Linked and Pierced Illusion\"*—its meaning was clarified earlier.\n\nThe one who calls himself *\"Nan Shan Da Wang\"* (Southern Mountain King), *Nan* (south) being the *Li* (trigram of wood) and belonging to the heart—\n*\"For hundreds of years, I have roamed here\"*—speaks of his demonic form arising from long indulgence of the heart, hence he is singled out to refute his arrogance by invoking Laozi, the Buddha, and Confucius, the three great sages of the teachings.\n\nThe Fifth Patriarch said:\n*\"The body is the Bodhi tree, the mind the mirror platform.\nEver diligently wipe and polish it,\nLest dust gather upon it.\"*\n\nFurther still:\n*\"Bodhi has no tree, the mirror no platform.\nOriginally, there is no single thing—\nWhere could dust gather upon it?\"*\n\nThough their exhortations differ in tone,\nboth illuminate the mind’s proper clarity and purity.\n\nThe boar belongs to *Hai* (the eleventh earthly branch), *Hai* being wood;\nthe monkey belongs to *Shen* (the ninth earthly branch), *Shen* being metal.\nWhen out of harmony, metal subdues wood, creating jealousy;\nwhen in harmony, metal generates water to nourish wood,\nand the fire within wood generates earth to foster metal—\nthus it aids.\n\nMetal and wood have both restraining and fostering relationships.\nMetal becomes true gold when refined by water and fire;\nwood thrives when nourished by metal and water.\nThe original pairing of husband and wife\nnever truly departs.\n\nWhen husband and wife live in harmony, the household prospers;\nwhen metal and water are balanced, the body and life align—\nthis is the Dao/Way of water’s inherent tranquility,\nwhich calms inner and outer, repelling chaos.\nThus, the demon is subdued from this very source.\n\nYet though the demon comes from without,\nits true origin lies within the mind.\nSo whatever the mind creates,\nthe demon knows;\nwhatever the demon creates,\nthe mind knows.\n\nThe practitioner recognizes this as *\"the Plum Blossom’s Divided Petal Strategy\"*,\nand also knows *\"the demon’s dwelling is here—my master must be in this very place\"*,\nboth insights arising from the mind’s own discernment.\n\nYet the most perilous deception is when the false resembles the true—\nlike the demon crafting a human head from a willow tree,\nwhich is easily discerned as false;\nbut far more treacherous is when it mimics the true,\nsuch as the demon fashioning a fresh human head as the master,\nseemingly real yet not—\nmost difficult to recognize.\nThus the practitioner brothers failed to perceive and wept together in lament.\n\nThe distinction between true and false is subtle,\nyet the root of right and wrong is easily confused.\n\nBut why did they weep as one?\nWas it because the practitioner truly believed in the illusion\nand led the crowd in grief?\n\nSorrow can turn black silk to green or yellow,\nand diverging paths can lead east or west.\nTheir unified weeping holds profound meaning!\n\nOnly through great lamentation\ncan one either mistake the false for the true,\nor seek the true while abandoning the false.\nHow so?\n\nWeeping is the mind’s pain—\nwith sound and tears, both arise from genuine sincerity,\nable to awaken true awareness.\nThe demon confuses me with falsehood,\nbut I master it with truth—\nthen evil cannot overcome righteousness,\nand the demon vanishes.\n\nThus, *\"Strive forward, shatter the Stone Gate!\"*\nand the fortress collapses.\n\nThose who once sought ease and slacked in discipline,\nnow suddenly rouse courage and sharpen their resolve—\nthe Southern Mountain King’s reckless form\ncan no longer be fully comprehended!\n\nBefore, the practitioner raised a false doppelgänger to summon the demon;\nnow, he employs a true doppelgänger to dispel it—\n*\"Strike from without, slay from within the ranks,\"*\nunited force and will, inner and outer assault—\noverthrowing the scheming *Cang Lang* (blue wolf),\nblocking the long-indulgent old fiend,\nthen calming the *qi* and preserving the mind,\nexamining its gateways,\npenetrating its origins and currents,\nslipping unseen into its lair—\ntrue and false now fully revealed,\ngreat demons and small, all trembling in confusion.\nWhat fear could there be of its plots and harm?\n\nRecognizing it as demonic,\nrefining its essence to true insight,\nall fiends fall, instantly silenced—\nits original form exposed,\nand the false paths shattered.\n\nOnly then does the true manifest,\nthe false perish,\nits roots severed, its form laid bare.\nThe Aiyue Leopard’s superficial illusions are removed,\nand my true mind remains unharmed.\nThis is how the woodcutter’s filial devotion,\nmoving heaven and earth,\nescaped death and glimpsed his mother’s true nature.\n\nThe woodcutter said:\n*\"Now the mountain is at peace,\nand I may travel through the night.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"This path leads west for less than a thousand *li*.\"*\n\nAh!",

Eighty-Seventh: The Phoenix Immortal County—Defying Heaven’s Drought, the Great Sage Sun Wukong Urges Benevolence to Bring Rain**\n\nThe Awakened One said:\n*\"This passage reveals that those who cultivate the True Way must first amass hidden virtue.\nBefore hidden virtue is complete,\neven a beautiful name is useless,\nand a half-finished deed collapses.\nGhosts and spirits cannot silently aid,\nand all deeds remain hollow pretense.\nOne must urgently turn inward and reflect,\nawaken boundless compassion,\nobserve strict discipline with diligent progress,\nand widely cultivate hidden virtue.*\n\n*What is hidden virtue?*\nCultivating one’s own *heaven* to honor others’ *heaven*—this is hidden virtue;\nacting secretly with skillful means—this is hidden virtue;\ngiving without expecting repayment—this is hidden virtue;\naccumulating goodness unknown to others—this is hidden virtue;\nnot forcing others into peril—this is hidden virtue;\nconcealing others’ flaws—this is hidden virtue.\n\nThe *sutra* says:\n*'When they bring calamity, I bring fortune;\nWhen they bring enmity, I bring virtue.'*\nAll these are deeds of hidden virtue,\nboundless in dispelling disasters and karmic retribution.\n\n*The Awakening of the True* says:\n*'Great joy lies in what is easy to know,'*\nfor knowledge comes from both self and *heaven*.\n\nIf one does not accumulate deeds and hidden virtue,\ndemons and fiends will obstruct at every turn.\nFor though one’s fate is not entirely by *heaven*,\nit lies in the marvel of creation within oneself;\nand though it is also by *heaven*,\nthe silent power of reflection rests with *heaven*.\n\nThe practitioner says:\n*'Only by amassing merit and virtue can I grant you this great rain,'*\n—this is the essence of this passage.\n\nThe name *'Phoenix Immortal County'* signifies a land of transcendent virtue,\nyet now it fails to accumulate hidden merit while boasting hollow fame.\nThough it claims to love the people outwardly,\nit secretly harms them.\nWith the people’s lives hanging in peril,\nhow can the true ruler appease *heaven’s* wrath?\n\nYet the county magistrate, *Shangguan*,\nis *'tenfold in his uprightness'* and *'deep in his love for the people.'*\nHis plea for rain to save the people is a deed of boundless goodness—\nhow then does he fail to move *heaven*?\n\nIt is said:\n*'This is outward virtue, not hidden virtue.'*\n\nFor though he is *'tenfold in his uprightness,'*\nhe is too bright, too rigid in righteousness—\nlike the fierce *yang* force,\nand thus *'unbenevolent.'*\nThe *Hongfan Transmission* says:\n*'If bright, then drought.'*\nBrightness is *yang* force unbalanced by *yin* to harmonize it.\nWithout *yin*’s nourishing flow,\nthe land’s vitality cannot penetrate deep,\nhuman efforts falter below,\nand *heaven’s* response manifests above—\ndrought is its sign.\n\nThus, rulers must embody benevolence and relief,\nwidely practice hidden virtue,\nand not prize mere clarity as wisdom.\n\nThe sages have said:\n*'Brightness without compassion is worse than ignorance.'*\nYao’s three pardons,\nYu’s descent from his chariot,\nTang’s release of the fishnets—\nall were brightness tempered by compassion.\n\nOfficials who receive *heaven’s* bounty,\nholding their posts by imperial command,\nmust cherish the land and its people—\nthis is their duty.\nWhat virtue do they possess?\n\nTrue virtue is known only to *heaven*,\nnot to mortals.\nYet when *'three years ago, on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month,\nShangguan’s household overturned the vegetarian offerings for the gods to feed dogs,\nand spoke blasphemous words, defying *heaven,’*\nthis was hidden evil—\nknown only to *heaven*, not to men.\n\nThe people are *heaven’s* creation;\n*heaven* loves all it creates.\nIf a ruler embodies *heaven’s* heart in loving the people,\nhe will surely receive *heaven’s* hidden reward—\nthis is an unchanging principle.\n\nTo love the people must begin with revering *heaven*,\nhence the saying: *'Revere *heaven* and diligently tend the people.'*\nNow Shangguan cannot revere *heaven* but instead profanes it—\nno greater crime exists!\n\nFor the people, food is *heaven*.\nThe offerings are what the people rely on for sustenance,\nthe foundation *heaven* uses to nourish them.\nTo overturn them for dogs is to deceive and extinguish both *heaven* and the people—\nwhat greater lack of benevolence could there be?\n\nThus, a thousand outward good deeds\ncannot outweigh one hidden evil act.\n\nHence the Sage is cautious in public and vigilant in solitude,\nwhile the virtuous man guards his private conduct.\n\nFor *yin* is the realm of solitary knowledge,\nand *virtue* is what one attains in the heart.\nIt is neither name-seeking nor reputation-chasing.\n\nWhen the roof leaks, the streets become thoroughfares;\nin dreams, night merges with day.\nSpirit and breath silently commune with the imperial throne—\nthe speed of response surpasses even drumbeats!\n\nYet the one who has incurred *heaven’s* wrath is the magistrate—\nhow then does disaster descend upon the common folk?\n\nThe magistrate is the wind, the people the grass:\nif the magistrate is unbenevolent, the people become unrighteous.\nAbove and below follow in kind—\n*qi* and kindred natures resonate.\nDay and night, his guilt festers into the people’s hidden anxieties;\na single moment of irreverence spreads as fate’s blessing or ruin for all.\n\nIf the magistrate creates it, the people will love him—\nthis is the natural order of cause and effect.\n\nThus, extraordinary local calamities\nmust stem from those in power losing virtue—\nand this drought, defying *heaven*, is entirely deserved.\n\nYet *heaven’s* heart is supremely benevolent,\nslow to punish evil to allow repentance,\nand swift to reward goodness to encourage virtue.\n\nThere are also the appropriate urgencies of *yin* and *yang*:\nhidden virtue is delayed to await accumulation and magnify its reward,\nwhile hidden evil is swiftly met to demonstrate *heaven’s* response and confirm its retribution.\n\nFor *yang* is known to all,\nwhile *yin* is known only to *heaven*.\nThough there are differences in urgency,\nthere is not the slightest error.\n\nWhen intent is absolute and aligned,\nit is not *heaven* that calls—\nbut the person who summons their own fate.\"*",

tripod or bell.\n\nAll possess it, each household holds it—\nthus, no need for eager exhortation to entice,\nnor for frantic efforts to rescue.\n\nThose who return are not hindered by waiting for an invitation,\nand seekers are not delayed by anger before guidance begins;\nchildren are not burdened by my brevity,\nand the reckless are not burdened by my indulgence.\n\nIt can be the **unsummoned** true friend of all beings,\nand the **owner** of the Four Dependencies and Ten Stages.\n\nUnlike the **golden elixir of return-to-origin**, passed down only once in ten thousand aeons,\nwhich must be kept secret and never revealed.\n\nThese three monks, within the **violent-silk pavilion’s** quiet chamber,\non the same day accepted disciples,\nreceived the **divine transmission** of the **Sramana’s** (沙门) teachings,\nand **circulated the cosmos** through their **mystic energy**—\nthis is called the **open transmission** of the **Sramana’s** (沙) Law,\nno more than external tools like weapons and martial prowess.\nTheir **subduing-pig, taming-monkey** (降猪伏猴) hidden marvels\nwere never uttered aloud or exposed in plain sight.\n\nThe **eight precepts’** stake and mallet weigh **5,048 jin** (斤) in total,\na single **treasure’s** measure.\nThe **Sramana’s** (沙) staff also weighs **5,048 jin**,\nalso a single **treasure**—\nno difference in principle.\n\nThe **lonely wanderer’s** (独行者) rod weighs **13,500 jin**,\nfor it has already encompassed the **three treasures’** total,\nyet it lacks the **three-five** (三五) harmonious perfection.\n\nThis tool can be replicated in form,\nbut must never be abandoned day or night—\nin the **Buddhist** tradition, it is called the **\"subduing-demon staff\"** (降魔杵),\nin the **Daoist** tradition, the **\"wise sword\"** (慧剑),\nand in the **Confucian** tradition, the **\"righteous cleaver\"** (刚断).\nIt is an innate **intelligence**, a **treasure** for safeguarding truth and banishing evil—\nnever to be parted from for an instant.\nThus, **\"a million rays of crimson light pierce the heavens,\na thousand streams of auspicious qi illuminate the earth.\"**\n\nIf one does not **return the spirit** and **abandon the body**,\nbut instead **departs for a moment**,\none will fall prey to **external demons**.\n\nHence, **\"when left in the straw shed for three days,\"\nit was swept away by the **devouring jaws of the

**misfortune from presuming without a teacher**.\n\nBefore the **jade brilliance** (玉华) assembly was held,\nit was **ancestral transmission**—\ntrue knowledge and genuine power—\nhence called the **\"authentic Law assembly\"** (施法会).\nThis **stake and mallet** (钉钯) assembly,\nhowever, is **false and teacherless**—\nself-asserted, arbitrary—\nthus called the **\"empty assembly\"** (虚设会).\n\nThe phrase **\"Tiger’s Mouth Mountain, Leopard’s Head Cave\"** (豹头山虎口洞)\nclearly reveals those who **devour and indulge** in such teachings,\npretending to be **divine immortals**,\nyet unaware of their own **wicked nature**.\n\nTheir **headgear** is the **Daoist cap** (道冠),\nyet in truth, it is the **leopard’s head** (豹头);\ntheir **utterances** are **Daoist speech** (道言),\nyet in truth, it is the **tiger’s jaws** (虎口).\n\nTo generalize:\n**Long sashes and short staffs** (长绦短麈) mimic the **master’s trimmed tail** (师剪尾) arrogance;\n**Patched robes and straw sandals** (衲服芒鞋) imitate the **spotted and tattered** appearance.\nThey **entrap the fox** (绥狐) with **sharp claws** (利爪),\nstoring **nightly seduction** (夜夜之娇) in their **gourd** (葫芦);\nthey **seize the green serpent** (青蛇) with **bared fangs** (张牙吻),\nconcealing **clinking daggers** (铮铮之匕) in their **pouch**.\nThey **follow the traces of Master Zhang** (杖远公),\nyet **do not hear the Three Mysteries** (三藐不闻);\nthey **wear the coarse robes of Master Damo** (着达摩之农),\nyet **have not yet understood the One** (一归未解);\nthey **recite the sutras of Master Bolu** (诵波罗之经),\nyet **deceit proliferates** (诡谲丛生).\n\nTheir **cushion** (蒲团) serves as the **den of a cunning hare** (狡兔之窟),\ntheir **alms bowl** (钵盂) seeks the **land of drunken ease** (酣蘖之乡).\nThey **linger in the Jeta Grove by day** (祗园),\nand **haunt the Flower Market at night** (花市),\n**bodily a monk** (身比丘),\nyet **in heart, a thief like Jié** (心盗跖).\nHow different can this be?\n\nIn the chapter, the Prince remarked:\n*\"People say there are immortals in the

      "translated_text": "The traveler ascends to the southern peak, where the demon retreats into its lair, feigning cowardice and hiding. The mountain spirit declares:\n*\"This mountain, from ancient times to now, has never harbored a demon—it is a land of fivefold auspicious *yáng* energy. If the Great Sage seeks a demon, he should look toward the Western Heavenly Path.\"*\n\nThis reveals the limited wisdom of one unable to discern true from false. Little do they know that the five radiant *yáng* lands are precisely where the essence of *jīn* (metal) lies concealed. Then:\n\n*\"When the traveler reaches the southern peak’s cavern, two massive stones block the entrance. With an iron rod, he pries them apart—the demon, startled, leaps out with a ‘whoosh!’ Terrifying the mountain spirit and earth god into frantic retreat.\"*\n\nThis is what is meant by *\"speaking the truth sends demons into panic.\"*\n\nA true practitioner recognizes that where five-colored lotuses bloom atop a mountain, the earth’s rivers and mountains are but a single jewel hidden within. True and false intertwine—who can truly distinguish them?\n\nSuddenly, the Star of Lesser Yin reveals how the Jade Rabbit stole the elixir, exposing the case of Chang’e’s descent to the mortal realm. With the truth laid bare, the demon’s original form is exposed—*\"rolling about to reveal its true nature.\"*\n\nThus, the luminosity of Lesser Yin illuminates the true and false of Lesser Yin itself; beyond this illumination, there is no other light.\n\n*\"A radiant patch of clouds appears in the south, bright as day\"*—this marks the moment when the Jade Rabbit returns to its true form. The traveler’s loud cry awakens the deluded. Eight Rules’ lustful impulse is a warning against carnal desire. The king inquires further, realizing the false princess was the true Jade Rabbit, while the true princess was the false one. By removing the false and seeking the true, the old monk’s urgent words at the Golden Temple become clear.\n\nWhen the Jade Rabbit is returned to the Moon Palace, the true *yīn* returns to India. Retracing the illusions of moon-viewing and ball-playing, recounting the tragic separation of mother and child, and reforming the subjugation system of the Precious Flower Monastery—these lingering details all touch upon profound truths. Yet to truly discern true from false, one must awaken the heart.\n\nFurther clarification: The false princess is indeed false—false in her assumed form, yet before assuming it, she was true. Before capture, she was the false princess; once exposed, she became true. False yet truly real—who can distinguish this?\n\nThe true *yīn* is the true princess. Only after returning to purity is she truly true; before that, she cannot be called true. Only when she returns to purity can she reunite with the *língyuán*—can she be said to reunite with it before purity? Even this is false. True yet truly false—who can distinguish this?\n\nDeeper still: The Jade Rabbit is a celestial beast; Chang’e is a celestial maiden. Within the Moon Palace, only the Jade Rabbit’s spirit is vital—all the immortals’ elixirs depend on its mortar and pestle. The Moon Palace can do without Chang’e, but not the Jade Rabbit. The Rabbit is the false consort of the king’s realm yet the true one of the Moon Palace; Chang’e is the true consort of the *Kūn* (receptive) realm yet the false one of the *Qián* (creative) realm. This too must be discerned.\n\nEarlier, the traveler remarked:\n*\"A woman’s husband is her noble one—how could he not be seated?\"*\nThe character *\"seated\"* (坐) combines two *\"people\"* (人) into *\"earth\"* (土). Earth contains *wù-jǐ* (the five earthly branches), and without this earth, a person cannot pair—*\"seated\"* is the subtle essence of *\"deeply in mind.\"*\n\nThe Buddha said:\n*\"Within the *qián-kūn*, between heaven and earth, there is a treasure hidden in the form-mountain, not in the heart or kidneys, but in the *xiānguān* orifice.\"*\nThe term *\"noble\"* (貴) symbolizes *\"a treasure within\"* and is the essence of *\"urgent matters.\"*\n\nAs for *\"India\"* (天竺) and *\"Precious Flower\"* (寶華), *\"heaven\"* (天) is *\"two people\"* (二人), *\"India\"* (竺) is *\"two\"* (二个)—within lies the birth of the Precious Treasure, the essence of *\"encountering a match.\"*\n\nThe final four words—*\"realized nature\"* (了性) and *\"true emptiness\"* (真空)—are not to be confused with the annihilation of nature or empty stillness. These must be clearly distinguished.\n\n---\n**Ninety-sixth Chapter: Leak the Official Welcomes a High Monk, Tang the Elder Rejects Wealth and Nobility**\n\nA disciple asked: In the following two chapters, the calamities of protecting the *dharma* and destroying the *dharma* are shown as one. One uses the slaughter of ten thousand monks as an analogy; the other feigns inviting ten thousand monks. Practitioners must scrutinize their intentions—relying on those with great virtue and strength to protect the *dharma*, not flaunting wealth to invite disaster.\n\nAt the chapter’s start:\n*\"The Pilgrim asks his disciples, ‘What place is this?’ The traveler replies, ‘I do not know, I do not know.’\"*\nThese two *\"I do not know\"* are the key insight.\n\nHuman hearts are unfathomable, and circumstances ever-changing. A tiger may sit guard at the gate, yet the host invites monks to a feast—how can one say one cannot eat at a tiger’s mouth? The surname *Kòu* (寇) suggests banditry, yet the host shows no plundering intent—why suspect the *Kòu* clan and harbor doubts? An old woman fears no ugliness, recognizing the celestial and human realms—why then the shift from respect to rudeness? The heart is unfathomable.\n\nThe son, though seemingly aligned, bows in submission—yet why does a good beginning turn to ruin? Circumstances are ever-changing. At the close of spring and dawn of summer, when the *dào* flows freely, listening to two discuss rise and fall demands vigilant reflection.",

Those who find it difficult to cross and walk are simply those who love their bodies.\n\nThus, if one loves their body while desiring to cross, they must use a boat—and if they use a boat, they must have a bottom. Without a bottom, it is drowning the body; if drowning the body, it is better not to cross or walk at all—then how can it be called love? Not knowing that a boat has a bottom means loving the body while actually drowning it; without a bottom, it is not loving the body yet not drowning it.\n\nWhy? People do not know that a boat *with* a bottom is hollow, while a boat *without* a bottom is solid. A boat with a bottom is the kind people use daily—it saves the body from drowning, yet some fear drowning and refuse to use it; a boat without a bottom is the kind people use once—it saves the body yet *must* drown it, and there will never be those who fear drowning and refuse to use it.\n\nNow, let us test those who have traveled the road for a long time and ask them: *\"If there were a bottomless boat, would you board it?\"* People will surely be angry, calling it either foolishness or madness, unaware that they are already boarding a bottomless boat and drowning themselves.\n\nAgain, let us test those who have traveled the road for a long time and ask them: *\"If there were a bottomless boat that would never drown you, would you board it?\"* People will again be angry, calling it either falsehood or deceit, unaware that there are those who board boats with bottoms and yet still drown.\n\nThus, the bottomless boat is one that all must board yet cannot treat lightly. If one has *vast qi* yet cannot nurture it well, or has a spirit of solitary vigilance yet cannot examine things thoroughly, they have not yet reached the **Lingyun Crossing** or the **Bridge of a Single Plank**—they are like an ape that is strong yet a horse that is unbroken, unable to board the boat and cross.\n\nIf one can nurture their *vast qi* well, maintain solitary vigilance, and reach the **Lingyun Crossing** and the **Bridge of a Single Plank**, yet still wishes to board a boat with a bottom to cross, they are like an ape that is not yet mature and a horse that is not yet trained—unable to board the boat and ask to cross.\n\nAn ape must be fully integrated and unobstructed before it is called mature; a horse must have its strength fully transformed before it is called trained. Confucius said: *\"Hear the Dao in the morning, die in the evening—what more can one ask?\"* Meaning, without hearing the Dao, death is impossible; but if one hears the Dao, even death is acceptable.\n\nThis is called *\"the ape is mature, the horse is trained, only then can one shed the shell.\"* Without the ape being mature and the horse trained, one cannot board the bottomless boat. People all know that a bottomless boat can drown the body, yet they do not know it cannot drown the mature ape and trained horse. People all know that a bottomless boat can drown the body and never rise again, yet they do not know that a bottomless boat cannot drown the trained and mature ape and horse, and they will rise without drowning.\n\nWhen people board a bottomless boat yet still believe it has a bottom, it truly has a bottom, yet they do not know they will drown and never rise. Again, when they see others board a bottomless boat and believe it has no bottom, that they will drown and never rise, it truly is rising without drowning, yet they do not know.\n\nThough it is the same bottomless boat, one assumes it has a bottom and will not drown; though it is the same bottomless boat, there is a vast difference between drowning and not drowning, yet they assume it is the same drowning with no distinction.\n\nThus, what they call a boat *with* a bottom is actually bottomless; what we call a boat *without* a bottom is actually bottomed. Does the boat with a bottom truly float? Is the boat without a bottom truly stable? Is the boat with a bottom truly stable? Is the boat without a bottom truly stable?\n\nTherefore, to board a bottomless boat and truly be stable is something only the mature ape and trained horse can do. To make the ape mature and the horse trained requires the alchemical work of *jin dan*.\n\nThe maturity of the ape is not the maturity of the mind, but the seamless integration of the Dao itself; the training of the horse is not the training of the will, but the complete transformation of one’s cultivation. Mistaking the mind for the ape and the will for the horse is not the grounded practice of reality.\n\nIn the text, those who *\"fake the realm and forcefully bow\"* are not the mature ape and trained horse; those who *\"reach the true realm and dismount\"* are the mature ape and trained horse.\n\n*\"Dao-children guiding\"* is the alchemical essence; *\"being tricked by Guanyin\"* is not trickery, but seeing that Tang Seng can progress gradually yet not suddenly.\n\n*\"Bathing\"* is the verification of the mature ape and trained horse; *\"yesterday in rags, today resplendent\"* is the completion of *jin dan* and shedding the mundane.\n\n*\"Not yet on the Cloud Path, must walk the original path\"*—this clarifies that abandoning the path of cultivating immortality cannot reach the sacred mountain, seeing Tang Seng’s necessity of gradual progress.\n\n*\"Clouds come, clouds go, never truly stepping on this ground\"*—this reveals the traveler’s ability to attain sudden enlightenment without gradual progression.\n\n*\"Just walk out from the Hall of the Celestial Realm, the back door is right there\"*—after action, there is non-action.\n\n*\"Tang Seng sees the living water flowing, startled and mistakenly points; the traveler laughs, saying, ‘No mistake.’ Pointing to the great bridge, one must cross over it to attain the Way\"*—this shows that this body has not yet left the mundane, danger still remains, and one must nurture *qi* until it cannot be nurtured further, maintain solitary vigilance until it cannot be maintained further, and only then can the Way be attained. This is the true time of genuine practice, finding no other path, hence it is said: *\"This is the path, this is the path!\"*\n\n*\"The traveler steps onto the bridge, running back and forth\"*—this is the sudden enlightenment of the superior sage, the ape being naturally mature.\n\nTang Seng says: *\"Difficult! Difficult!\"*",
      "overlap_context": "e people act recklessly without restraint, deceiving themselves in secret,\nyet when they reflect, they tremble with dread—\nlike a **Bridge of a Single Plank**—\nif one is diligent and cautious, treading carefully as though on thin ice,\nthen the spirit of solitary vigilance will traverse the **Bridge of a Single Plank**.\n\nIs this not the true realm of genuine practice?\nYet it must be done with sincerity, not achieved through imitation;\nit lies in examining things, not in clinging to one-sidedness.",

      "translated_text": "Eight Steppings says: *\"Slippery! Slippery! Slippery!\"*—this is the doubt and fear of the mediocre, as if they would ride the clouds and cross swiftly, yet this is the path of delusion taken by those who stray. Hence, the Traveler urgently stops them, forbidding deviation and guiding them back to the true, solid Dao.\n\nAfter shedding the mortal shell, master and disciple owe no thanks to each other—this embodies the principle of *er shi ju de* (both benefactors and beneficiaries), the essence of giving both *fa* (law/teaching) and wealth. Yet in this world, superior sages are few while mediocre minds prevail. None dare avoid death, though they must die; none dare board the bottomless ship, though they must board it. Only the Dao of *jin dan* (Golden Elixir) offers broad observation with true stability and solidity.\n\nBefore attaining *jin dan*, the body is not without peril; after attaining it, the body remains a hindrance to the Dao. Though one may choose not to ascend, it is not as superior as ascending to transcendence. As in the *Chuan Deng Lu* (Record of the Lamp): Lü Zu wandered the Lougu Platform, listening to Huanglong Jian’s Zen teachings. The master, knowing Lü was a transcendent, asked: *\"Who sits below—the river folk?\"* Lü replied: *\"A wandering monk of clouds and water.\"* The master said: *\"What if the clouds disperse and the water dries?\"* Lü had no answer. The master spoke again: *\"Huanglong appears.\"* Lü departed, leaving a poem:\n\n*\"Abandoning the gourd-bag, smashing the lute,\nNow I no longer covet mercury’s gold.\nSince first meeting Huanglong’s truth,\nI regret my past misguided heart.\"*\n\nThis is not regret for the error of mercury and gold, but regret for not realizing their noble transformation. Hence another poem says:\n\n*\"The Bag Monk ascends to Mingzhou,\nStaff in hand, sandals on feet, wandering freely.\nThough you may manifest in myriad forms,\nEach body still bears its own sorrow.\"*\n\nThis speaks further of transcendence within transformation. Thus, great Buddhas and immortals—some depart like cicadas shedding their shells, some perish in flames, some return westward by foot, some climb trees to demonstrate cultivation, some suffer harm to repay debts—though their traces differ, all await the moment when the ape is mature and the horse is tamed.\n\nFor they deeply understand that the physical form cannot endure, while the true spirit eternally persists. This is why the guiding masters emphasize *\"wan dong anran ziran\"* (ten thousand movements in tranquil ease).\n\n*\"Stepping on the ship, unable to stand\"*—this is the mind sinking into fear of death at the moment of ascent.\n*\"One pull and you’re raised\"*—this is the daily practice of *jin dan* pulling you along; not you alone, but all of us.\n*\"Downstream, floating corpses—all say, ‘It’s you, it’s you’\"*—not you alone, but all of you.\n\nAt this stage, how could one not rejoice? This is the boundless wisdom, the birth into the other shore, the supreme truth beyond limits—what need is there for *\"lingyun\"* (soaring clouds), *\"du mu\"* (single plank), or *\"wudi\"* (bottomless ship)?\n\nLiberated from the mortal coil, the work is complete, the path fulfilled.\nAdrift atop the Soul-Mountain’s peak, bowing beneath the Tathagata’s feet,\nOnly then does one recognize Avalokiteshvara’s compassion—\nA single mind entrusted to the *One Hundred Fifty-Four Thousand Fourteen* volumes,\nYet ultimately contained within the *True Scripture of No-Writing*.\n\nThis Scripture is most exalted and precious—guard against transmitting it with empty hands, lest customs grow vulgar and ignorant, leading to disrespect and arrogance. Use the *No-Writing Scripture* for the superior sage, the *Written Scripture* for the masses. The Buddha’s differentiation in transmission mirrors Confucius’ teaching tailored to the student—how different can they be?\n\nAnanda first transmitted the *No-Writing True Scripture*—not out of deceit, but fear of disrespect. Later, he exchanged it for the *Five Thousand Forty-Eight Volume Written Scripture*—transmitting the Golden Elixir with the Golden Bowl. For the *No-Writing* is the sudden method, the *Written* the gradual. Sudden is non-action, gradual is action. From gradual to sudden, from action to non-action—all are True Scriptures. The True Scripture never departs from the *No-Writing River Diagram* and the *Written I Ching*, hence it is said:\n\n*\"The source of the Three Teachings—treasure it! Cherish it!\nWithin lie the secrets of immortality and Dao attainment,\nUnveiling the marvelous prescriptions for ten thousand transformations.\"*",

Truly a marvelous prescription!\n\nReaders may claim this book shows Daoist and Buddhist origins as one, with Dao as the gateway and Zen as the ultimate attainment—this seems plausible! Yet unknown is that this book solely expounds the Great Dao of the alchemical Golden Elixir. The phrase *\"attaining immortality and completing the Way\"* serves as its entire footnote.\n\nBuddha and Immortal cannot be realized without the Golden Elixir—only through transforming action into non-action. There is no superiority or inferiority. Immortal is Buddha; Buddha is Immortal. The Buddha is called *\"Great Awakened Golden Immortal,\"* while the Immortal is named *\"Great Luo True Immortal.\"* One and two, two and one.\n\nThus it concludes:\n*\"Seeing nature, clarifying mind, and communing with the Buddha-patriarchs—\nWhen virtue is complete and practice fulfilled, one ascends to the skies.\"*\n\n**Ninety-ninth Chapter**\n*\"Ninety-nine times complete, demons eradicated—\nThree threes fulfilled, the Way returns to its root.\"*\n\nThe disciple of enlightenment says: This passage elucidates the meaning of *\"even a hair’s breadth difference prevents elixir completion.\"*\n\nTo let mortals penetrate yin-yang, deeply grasp transformation, measure time like an incense clock, and precisely calculate the fire’s moment—neither excess nor deficiency—only then may one obtain the Golden Elixir, shed the mortal frame, and renew the bones. Should even a hair’s breadth differ, it is like walking ninety paces in a hundred-mile journey.\n\nThe poem concludes with *\"Anciently, its mysteries align with *The Concordance of the Three*\"*—this is the book’s entire essence.\n\nThe *River of Heavenly Passage* marks the halfway point of the ten thousand eight thousand [stages], yet here it proposes returning to origin to complete the nine nines. It reveals that lacking one in nine nines is like abandoning the halfway mark in vain.\n\nThe term *\"Heavenly Passage\"* is chosen because the heavens span fifty-four thousand *li*—the measure of one *藏* (treasure-house). This is when the Great Sage rescues the primordial essence with a fish basket.\n\nThough called half the labor, the latter half achieves only the former half. Laozi said: *\"The Mysterious, yet more mysterious.\"* The first *\"Mysterious\"* refers to the first half; the *\"yet more\"* to the second.\n\nHow could one recognize this without the patriarchs’ direct transmission of the profound intent? Ah! The meaning of *Heavenly Passage* and return to origin is profound.

The tortoise’s tale of forgotten trust serves as a critical warning at the *Heavenly Passage*’s most vital moment, emphasizing that true faith must be held here, lest any error arise.\n\nThis is the true *cloak and bowl* of the *Eight Vajra Protectors*, whispering, *“Thus and thus—follow the Bodhisattva’s precepts, not to be violated.”*\nIt cannot be explained through words alone.\n\nIf one interprets the Dao-body as pure *Qian* [Creative], admitting no trace of *yin* [Receptive], or that the *disaster star* remains unfulfilled and still relies on this place to complete it—then one fails to grasp the subtlety of *returning to origin*.\n\n*\"The Three Treasures pressed the sutra, Sand Monk pressed the sutra, the traveler guarded left and right to prevent *yin* demons from wasting [the qi].\"*\nThis reveals that the sutra and this place are prone to error, requiring urgent protection until the *yin* dissipates.\n\nThe traveler said: *“This sutra steals the creative power of Heaven and Earth, enduring as long as the cosmos, as bright as sun and moon, with eternal spring and an unbroken *dharma-body.”*\nThese are the true meanings of *golden elixir*, not mere praise.\n\nAt the brink of completion, one must fear external demons sapping or stealing the work—vigilance must be absolute, never lax.\n\nWhen the sutra’s tail is stained, *“This is the mystery of Heaven and Earth’s incompleteness, beyond human power to remedy.”*\nLaozi said: *“Great completion seems deficient—its use is inexhaustible.”*\n\nReaders claim that Heaven and Earth’s deficiency is, in fact, the grandest truth—mere idle speculation.\n\nSome say the old tortoise’s words exposed it, but I say they ruined it. If *“Heaven and Earth’s incompleteness”* is already a mystery, why must it be explained? Only a true master’s transmission can reveal its *“incompleteness”*—how could one guess its meaning?\n\nAh! Only those who grasp the ebb and flow of the *tidal source* will know the body’s own fullness and emptiness.",

Ah! The meaning of *Heavenly Passage* and return to origin is profound. Studying the poem *\"Nine Nines Return to Truth\"* may grant some enlightenment.\n\nThe traveler lifts his head and gazes back: *\"Here! Here!\"*",
