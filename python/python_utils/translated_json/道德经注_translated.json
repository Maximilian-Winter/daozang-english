  "full_translation": "The *Laozi Dao De Jing* (Chapter on the Dao/Way)\n\n**Chapter 1: Cultivating the Dao/Way** (Title absent in pre-Tang editions)\n\nThe Dao/Way that can be spoken of—\nThat is the Dao/Way of learned doctrines and political teachings.\n\nThe Dao/Way that cannot be spoken of—\nThat is not the Dao/Way of natural longevity.\n\nThe true Dao/Way is to nurture the spirit with *wu* (non-action),\nto keep the people undisturbed,\nto hold light within and conceal brilliance,\nto efface traces and conceal origins,\nso that it cannot be named.\n\nThe name that can be named—\nThat is the name of wealth, honor, high rank, and worldly distinction.\n\nThe name that cannot be named—\nThat is not the name of natural permanence.\n\nThe true name is like the infant before speech,\nthe rooster before crowing,\nthe pearl within the shell,\nthe fine jade still in stone,\nthe light still unmanifested.\nThough inwardly clear, outwardly it appears as foolishness.\n\n*Wu* (the unnamable) is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\nThe beginning is the origin of the Dao/Way,\nemitting *qi* and spreading transformation,\narising from the void,\nas the fundamental source of Heaven and Earth.\n\n*You* (the named) is the mother of all things.\nThat is, Heaven and Earth—\nwith their forms, positions, yin and yang, soft and hard—\nare the named.\nThe mother of all things is Heaven and Earth,\nwhich contain *qi* and give birth to myriad beings,\nnourishing them to growth and maturity,\nas a mother nurtures her child.\n\nThus, one who habitually has no desires\ncan observe its subtlety—\nthat is, the unity of the Dao/Way.\n\nOne who habitually has desires\ncan observe their consequences—\nthat is, where worldly inclinations lead.\n\nThese two arise from the same source yet bear different names.\nThe two—habitual non-desire and habitual desire—\narise from the same human heart,\nyet their names differ.\nThe one called \"non-desire\" endures forever,\nwhile the one called \"desire\" perishes in the body.\n\nBoth are called *xuan* (the mysterious).\nThat is, *xuan* (the mysterious) is Heaven.\nIt speaks of how both those with and without desires\nreceive *qi* from Heaven.\n\nThe mysterious, yet more mysterious—\nHeaven within Heaven.\nThe thickness of the *qi* one receives:\nif one attains harmony and pure nourishment, then sages are born;\nif one attains disorder and corruption, then greed and lust arise.\n\nThe gateway to all subtleties—\nTo know that Heaven contains Heaven,\nthat the *qi* one receives varies in richness,\nand to discard emotions and desires,\nto preserve harmony—\nthis is called the doorway to understanding the Dao/Way’s essential subtleties.\n\n**Chapter 2: Nurturing the Body**\n\n「All under Heaven know beauty as beauty.\n—It is self-promotion, making it manifest.\n\nYet this is already ugliness.\n—It harbors danger and decay.¹\n\nAll under Heaven know goodness as goodness.\n—It brings honor and fame.\n\nYet this is already not-goodness.\n—It is what people strive for.\n\nThus, having and not-having give rise to each other.\n—Seeing what is present as what is absent.\n\nDifficult and easy complete each other.\n—Seeing what is difficult as what is easy.\n\nLong and short define one another.\n—Seeing what is short as what is long.¹\n\nHigh and low incline toward each other,\n—Seeing what is high as what is low.\n\nSounds harmonize with one another.\n—When the upper sings, the lower must respond.\n\nFront and back follow in sequence.\n—When the upper moves, the lower must follow.¹\n\nTherefore, the sage dwells in affairs of non-action.\n—He governs by the Dao/Way.\n\nHe practices teaching without speech.\n—He leads by example, guiding with his conduct.\n\nAll things arise and he does not claim them.\n—Each moves naturally, without refusal or obstruction.¹\n\nHe acts yet does not rely on it.\n—What the Dao/Way accomplishes, He does not depend upon or expect reward in return.²\n\nWhen his virtue is complete, he does not dwell in it.\n—When his work is done, he withdraws, not clinging to his position.¹\n\nOnly because he does not dwell in it,\n—His virtue/power remains ever-present, never leaving his person.\n\nThis is how one cannot act without following,\nnor speak without being known.\n\nThe six lines above discuss high and low, long and short,\n—The ruler opens one source, from which a hundred branches emerge,\nand the myriad transformations of those branches\nnever fail to stir unrest.¹\n\n**Chapter 3: Settling the People**\nThe sage does not exalt the conventionally wise.\n—The conventionally wise are those of the world who,\nwith eloquence and skill in words,\ndepart from the Dao/Way, clinging to expedience,\nand discard substance for superficial ornamentation.\nTo not exalt them means\nnot to honor them with wealth nor elevate them with office,\nso the people do not vie in strife.\n\nHe does not prize difficult-to-obtain treasures.\n—That is, the ruler does not indulge in rare jewels or delicacies;\ngold is abandoned in the hills,\npearls and jade are cast into the depths.\nThus, the people do not become thieves.\n\nHe does not display what is desirable.\n—He rejects the wanton music of Zheng,\nand keeps away flatterers.\nThus, the people’s hearts remain undisturbed.\n\nTherefore, the sage’s governance—\nWhether ruling a state or nurturing the body—\nis marked by emptiness of the heart,\n—Discarding cravings, banishing tumult.\n\nFilling the belly,\n—Embracing the Dao/Way, holding to unity,\nand preserving the Five Spirits.³\n\nWeakening the will,\n—Yielding gently, humbly, and without arrogance,\nnot clinging to power.\n\nStrengthening the bones,\n—Cherishing essence, moderating exertion,\nso marrow is full and bones are firm.\n\nEver keeping the people in ignorance and without desire,\n—Returning to simplicity, guarding purity,\nso that even the clever dare not act.\n\nDoing without doing,\n—Not contriving, moving only as circumstances dictate,\nthen nothing remains ungoverned.\n—His virtue/power is profound, the people at ease.\n\n**Chapter 4: The Source of the Dao/Way**\nThe Dao/Way is boundless yet finds its use within.\n—Boundless, meaning central and unobstructed;\nits use lies in the middle.\n\nThe Dao/Way is hidden, nameless, and stores merit,\nyet its application is found in the central.\nSometimes it does not overflow.\n—Sometimes, meaning always;\nthe Dao/Way is ever humble, never full.\n\nDeep as if the origin of all things,\n—Its depths are unfathomable, like the ancestral source of all things.\n\nDulling its sharpness.\n—Sharpness means aggressive advancement;\nwhen people seek to sharpen their essence and grasp for honor,\none must blunt their pursuit of the Dao/Way.\n\nDispelling its confusion.\n—Confusion means entangled roots;\none must reflect that the Dao/Way is non-action to resolve it.\n\nSoftening its brightness.\n—Though he may possess singular insight,\nhe must know the darkness,\nnot using it to disturb others.\n\nEqualizing with the common dust.\n—He must always align with the masses,\nnot setting himself apart.\n\nCalm as if preserved.\n—He must remain tranquil and undisturbed,\nthus enduring without perishing.\n\nI do not know whose child it is.\n—The *Laozi* says, \"I do not know from whence I was born.\"\n\nIt precedes the Emperor.\n—The Dao/Way exists before Heaven and Earth,\nthis saying that the Dao/Way is born prior to Heaven and Earth.\n\nTo this day, those who endure\nare able to remain tranquil and undisturbed,\nnot laboring or desiring,\nso that people may model themselves after the Dao/Way.\n\n**Chapter 5: The Use of Emptiness**\nHeaven and Earth are not kind.\n—They bestow and transform without favor,\nnot acting from benevolence but following nature.\n\nThey treat all things as fodder and beasts.\n—Heaven and Earth give birth to all things,\nyet regard humans as no more precious than grass or dogs;\nthey do not expect gratitude in return.\n\nThe sage is not kind.\n—The sage nourishes the people without benevolence,\nmimicking Heaven and Earth in natural action.\n\nHe treats the people as fodder and beasts.\n—The sage regards the people as no more precious than grass or dogs,\nnot expecting their respect or obedience.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\n—The space between Heaven and Earth is void and filled with harmonious *qi*,\nso all things arise naturally.\nIf a person can discard emotions and desires,\nmoderate tastes and nourishment,\nand purify the Five Organs,\nthen the spirit will dwell within.\n\nIt is like the bellows.\n—The bellows is hollow yet produces sound;\nif one’s body remains empty yet unbroken,\nand moves with greater vitality,\nthen...»\n\n「――Thus, when the body is empty yet unbroken,\nand the *qi* moves with greater vitality,\nthere is no time of exhaustion or collapse\nwhen its sound and breath arise.\n\nExcessive speech leads to depletion.\n—Excessive speech harms the body,\nand reckless words bring misfortune.\nBetter to preserve the center.\n\n—Better to cultivate *virtue/power* within,\nnourishing the spirit and *qi*,\nwhile speaking sparingly.\n\nThe sixth chapter completes the form:\n*The Grain Spirit* does not die.\n—This refers to nourishment from the *Grain*.\nIf a person can nourish the spirit,\nthen they will not die.\nThe *spirit* here refers to the vital essences of the Five Organs.\nIf the Five Organs are all injured,\nthen the Five Spirits depart.\n\nThis is called the *Dark Mother*.\n—This speaks of the *Dark* being the source of immortality.\n*Dark* is Heaven.\nIn humans, it is the nose,\nwhich houses the heart,\nwhere the Five *qi* gather in subtle purity—\nthe essence of spirit and clarity,\nthe resonance of sound and the Five Virtues.\nIts ghostly form is called *hun*—\nthe *hun* is masculine,\ngoverning the breath entering and leaving through the nose,\nand communicating with Heaven,\nso the nose is called *Dark*.\n\nEarth nourishes humans with the Five Flavors,\nwhich enter through the mouth\nand lodge in the stomach.\nThe Five Virtues here are turbid and coarse,\nmanifesting as flesh, bones, and sinews,\nwhile the Six Emotions flow through the blood and *vessels*—\nits ghostly form is called *po*.\nThe *po* is feminine,\ngoverning the breath entering and leaving through the mouth,\nand communicating with Heaven and Earth,\nso the mouth is called *Mother*.\n\nThe gate of *Dark Mother*—\nthis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\n—This is the *root element*.\nThe nose and mouth,\ninhaling and exhaling,\nare the pathways through which\nthe primordial *qi* of Heaven and Earth circulates.\nContinuous as silk,\nsubtle as if preserved yet absent.\n\nTo use it without strain.\n—To employ *qi* with ease and moderation,\nnot hastening or exhausting it.\n\nThe seventh chapter conceals its light:\nHeaven endures, Earth persists.\n—This explains Heaven and Earth’s longevity and vitality,\nto enlighten and teach humanity.\n\nWhy Heaven and Earth alone endure so long—\nit is because they do not seek to generate themselves.\n—Heaven and Earth endure uniquely long\nbecause they remain tranquil,\nacting without self-aggrandizement,\nnot seizing others’ benefits to enrich themselves.\nThus, they achieve eternal vitality.\n\nTherefore, the sage places themselves last.\n—This is the principle of prioritizing others before oneself.\nYet their self is foremost.\n—The world holds them in highest respect,\nand they are revered as the longest-lived.\n\nThey set themselves apart.\n—This is to be thin with oneself\nand generous with others.\nYet their self remains.\n—The people love them as parents,\nand the spirit of Heaven aids them\nlike a cherished child,\nso their self is ever preserved.\n\nNot because they lack selfishness.\n—The sage is loved by people and aided by Heaven\nnot because of their impartiality or lack of self-interest.\nThus, they fulfill their own desires.\n\nThe eighth chapter transforms nature:\nThe highest excellence is like water.\n—The person of highest excellence,\nlike water’s nature.\nWater benefits all things.\n—Water in Heaven is mist and dew,\non Earth it is springs and sources.\nYet it does not contend,\ndwelling where others revile.\n—Others detest lowliness, dampness, filth, and turbidity,\nbut water alone flows quietly therein.\nThus, it approaches the Dao.\n\nIt favors the lowly.\n—Water’s nature is to flow downward,\nlike the *Mother* in motion,\nalways descending to benefit humanity.\n\nThe heart favors depth.\n—Water is deep and empty,\nits depths pure and bright.\nIt aligns with *virtue/power*.\n—All things receive water to thrive,\nand it does not hoard what it gives—\nthis is the virtue of generosity.\n\nIt is trustworthy.\n—Water reflects all forms within,\nnever losing its essence.\n\nIt is upright.\n—It cleanses all impurities,\nremaining clear and even.\n\nIt is capable.\n—It adapts to square and round,\nto curves and straightness.\n\nIt acts in due time.\n—In summer it disperses,\nin winter it congeals,\nmoving in accordance with the seasons,\nnever losing its natural rhythm.\n\nOnly because it does not contend.\n—If blocked, it stops;\nif released, it flows—\nit yields to others.\nThus, it meets no blame.\n\nThe ninth chapter balances ease:\nHold and fill it,\nbut it is better to let it be.\n—*Fill* means *satisfied*.\n*Let it be* means *stop*.\nTo grasp at fullness is to invite collapse,\nbetter to cease before excess.\n\nShape and sharpen it,\nbut it cannot be long preserved.\n—*Shape* means *refine*.\nAfter refinement, it must be discarded.\nEven gold and jade in abundance,\nno one can guard them.\n\nWealth and honor bring arrogance,\nand they ruin themselves.\n—Great riches should be used to relieve the poor,\nand high status to cherish the lowly.\nYet if one grows proud and indulgent,\nmisfortune will follow.\nWhen achievement is complete and reputation established,\nretire from the world—\nthis is the Dao of Heaven.\n\nThe tenth chapter speaks of capacity:\nCarry the *hun* and *po*.\n—The *hun* and *po* are the vital spirits.\nHumans carry these spirits above,\nand must cherish them.\nIf one’s joy and anger disturb the *hun*,\nor fright and shock injure the *po*—\nthe *hun* resides in the liver,\nthe *po* in the lungs—\nthen rich wine and sweet delicacies\ncorrupt the lungs’ *po*,\nand the *hun* grows restless,\nwhile the will becomes chaotic and ungrounded.\nYet if the *hun* is tranquil and the *po* settled,\none’s life will be prolonged and years extended.\n\nEmbrace the *One* and remain undivided.\n—This means one can hold the *One* within,\nso it never departs from the body.\nThe *One* is the pure *qi* of the Dao’s origin,\nthe great harmony of primordial essence.\n\nThus, it is called the *One*.\nIts name spreads across the world:\nHeaven gains the *One* to achieve clarity,\nEarth gains the *One* to achieve tranquility,\nand rulers gain the *One* to achieve balance.\nIt enters as the heart,\nand manifests in action.\nIts distribution is called *virtue/power*,\nand its totality is called the *One*.\nThe *One* is the principle of singular will—\nno duality exists.»\n\nConcentrate the *qi* to attain softness.\n—If one steadfastly guards the vital *qi* so it remains undisturbed,\nthe body will respond with supple compliance.\n\nLike an infant.\n—If one is as an infant—\ninner thoughts unburdened, outer affairs unattended—\nthen the spirit will not stray.\n\nPurify and gaze into the void.\n—One must cleanse the heart to make it pure.\nThe heart dwells in the abyssal darkness,\nperceiving all things—\nthus it is called *playing with the void*.\n\nFree from blemish.\n—This means no indulgence in licentiousness.\nPurity itself is free from flaw.\n\nLove the people, govern the state.\n—Those who govern their bodies cherish *qi*,\nand thus preserve their form.\nThose who govern the state cherish the people,\nand thus secure the realm.\n\nWithout knowing.\n—Those who govern their bodies breathe the vital *qi*\nwithout letting the ears perceive it.\nThose who govern the state bestow virtue and benevolence\nwithout letting the people know of it.\n\nThe Celestial Gate opens and shuts.\n—The Celestial Gate refers to the Purple Forbidden Enclosure [North Celestial Pole].\nOpening and shutting refers to the five critical junctures [of life].\nFor governing the body, the Celestial Gate is the nostrils—\nopening is panting, shutting is breathing.\n\nWithout favoritism.\n—In governing the body, one should be like the female—\ntranquil, yielding, and weak.\nIn governing the state, one adapts harmoniously without contradiction.\n\nIlluminating and all-pervading.\n—This means clarity and openness,\nlike the sun and moon radiating through all eight extremes of the world,\nso that though unseen and unheard,\nits brilliance shines forth in all ten directions,\nresplendent and luminous.\n\nWithout knowing.\n—There is none who can know and fill the world.\n\nNurture and preserve.\n—The Dao generates all things and nurtures them.\nIt generates without possession.\n\nAct without reliance.\n—The Dao’s actions are not done in expectation of return.\n\nLong and yet not domineering.\n—The Dao nourishes all things without carving or shaping them for use.\n\nThis is called the *playful virtue*.\n—The Dao’s virtue is abyssal and unseen,\nintended to make people emulate the Way.\n\nThe eleventh chapter: *The Use of the Void*\nThirty spokes converge at a single nave.\n—Ancient chariots had thirty spokes, following the lunar cycle.\nThey converge at the nave because the nave’s center is hollow.\nThose who govern their bodies must eliminate desires and emotions,\nleaving the five *zàng*-organs empty,\nso the spirit may return.\nThose who govern the state must gather few abilities\nand unite the weak to make them strong.\n\nWhen there is no use, the chariot’s purpose is fulfilled.\n—No means emptiness.\nThe nave’s emptiness allows the chariot to move;\nthe carriage’s emptiness allows people to ride within.\n\nMold clay to make a vessel.\n—The vessel’s emptiness allows it to hold things.\n\nPierce walls to make a room.\n—This refers to constructing dwellings.\nWhen there is no use, the room’s purpose is fulfilled.\n—The walls’ emptiness allows entry and exit;\nthe room’s emptiness allows habitation—\nthis is its use.\n\nThus, having is for utility.\n—Utility for things, utility for form.\nThe vessel holds objects, the room holds people—\nlest the house collapse or the body perish,\nlest the spirit within fear annihilation.\n\nWithout having is for use.\n—Emptiness can contain all things,\nso the void governs the form.\nThe Dao is emptiness.\n\nThe twelfth chapter: *Restraining Desire*\nThe five colors blind the eyes.\n\n「――Indulgence in lust and fondness for beauty drains vital essence and causes blindness.\nThe five tones make one deaf.\n—To delight in the five tones disperses harmonious *qi*; the mind loses its ability to hear the sound of the unsounded.\n\nThe five flavors make the palate numb.\n—*\"Numb\" means \"lost.\"* When a person craves the five flavors in the mouth, speech is lost, and the taste of the Dao is abandoned.\n\nHunting and galloping across fields drive the mind to madness.\n—Human spirit prefers tranquility; reckless movement scatters vital essence, thus madness ensues.\n\nRare treasures cause one’s conduct to falter.\n—*\"Falter\" means \"injure.\"* Rare treasures—gold, silver, jade, and pearls—when coveted without restraint, harm the body and bring disgrace.\n\nThus, the sage cultivates the belly.\n—Preserving the five senses while discarding the six emotions, moderating will and nourishing spirit.\nNot the eyes.\n—The eyes must not gaze wantonly; wanton gazing dissipates essence outward.\nHence, abandon that and embrace this.\n—Abandon the eyes’ wanton gazing, embrace the belly’s cultivation of nature.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: *Aversion to Shame***\n\nRejoicing and humiliation are like sudden alarm.\n—Both honor and disgrace provoke alarm.\nGreat peril is like a personal affliction.\n—*\"Honor\"* means *\"fear.\"* *\"Like\"* means *\"until.\"* Fear great peril until it reaches oneself.\nThus, both cause alarm.\n\nWhat is meant by \"rejoicing and humiliation\"?\n—Asking what constitutes honor and what constitutes humiliation, then reflecting upon oneself to enlighten others.\nHumiliation is lowliness.\n—Humiliation is base.\nTo attain it is like alarm.\n—To gain honor is alarming, as if standing at the edge of an abyss.\nThe noble dare not be arrogant; the wealthy dare not be extravagant.\nTo lose it is like alarm.\n—*\"Lose\"* means *\"lose honor, suffer disgrace.\"* Alarm stems from fearing renewed calamity.\nThis is called *\"rejoicing and humiliation as alarm.\"*\n\nWhat is meant by *\"great peril is like a personal affliction\"*?\n—Again asking: why fear others as if they were oneself?\nThe reason I have great peril is because I have a body.\n—The reason I have great peril is that I have a body—its toil brings worry, its hunger and cold provoke emotions, and following desires invites misfortune.\nYet if I have no body, what peril could I have?\n—If I were without a body, attaining the Dao would allow effortless ascent, unobstructed movement, and communion with the Way—what peril could there be?\n\nThus, the noble who values the body for the sake of the world may entrust themselves to the world.\n—The ruler who values the body yet despises personal desire, seeking to govern the world, may temporarily establish themselves but cannot endure.\n\nThe loving ruler who values the body for the world may be entrusted to the world.\n—The ruler who loves the body not for themselves but as a parent to the people may entrust their rule to the people without enduring blame.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: *Praise of the Mysterious***\n\nIt is seen yet unseen—named *Yi*.\n—Without color is *Yi*.\nIt speaks of oneness without hue, invisible yet perceived.\n\nIt is heard yet unheard—named *Xi*.\n—Without sound is *Xi*.\nIt speaks of oneness without tone, inaudible yet perceived.\n\nIt is grasped yet not obtained—named *Wei*.\n—Without form is *Wei*.\nIt speaks of oneness without substance, unattainable yet sought.\n\nThese three cannot be interrogated.\n—The three refer to *Yi*, *Xi*, and *Wei*.\nWhat cannot be interrogated: without color, sound, or form, words cannot describe it, script cannot transmit it. It must be received in stillness, sought with spirit—unanswerable yet known.\n\nThus, they merge into one.\n—*\"Merge\"* means *\"unify.\"*\nThus, they unite under the three names as one.\n\nAbove, it is not luminous.\n—It speaks of one in the world not shining brightly.\nBelow, it is not obscure.\n—It speaks of one in the world not veiled in darkness.\n\nEndless, nameless.\n—*\"Endless\"* means boundless motion.\n*\"Nameless\"* means not a single color—cannot be distinguished as blue, yellow, white, or black.\nNot a single sound—cannot be heard as *gong*, *shang*, *jiao*, *zhi*, or *yu*.\nNot a single form—cannot be measured by length, shortness, size, or smallness.\nIt returns to nothingness.\n—*\"Nothingness\"* means *\"substance-less.\"*\nThis is called *\"the form of formlessness.\"*\nThe image of the formless.\n—One without substance yet shaping all things.\nThis is called *\"elusive and vague.\"*\n—One elusive and vague, as if present yet absent, unseen.\n\nApproach it, yet its head is unseen.\n—One has no beginning; it cannot be anticipated.\nAbandon emotions, discard desires—return to oneness.\n\nFollow it, yet its end is unseen.\n—One leaves no trace; it cannot be observed.\nHold fast to the ancient Way to govern the present.\n—The sage upholds the ancient Way, generating oneness to govern things, knowing the present must also return to oneness.\n\nTo know the ancient beginning is called the *Dao*’s principle.\n—If one knows the ancient origin of oneness, this is called understanding the fundamental structure of the Way.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: *Manifesting Virtue***\n\nThe ancients who excelled as scholars—\n—Referring to those who attained the Dao.\nWere subtle, mysterious, and penetrating.\n—*\"Mysterious\"* means *\"heavenly.\"* Their resolve was subtle and pure, in harmony with heaven.\nDeep beyond comprehension.\n—Their virtue was profound and inscrutable; inwardly blind, outwardly deaf, their excellence was unknown.\n\nBecause it was beyond comprehension, they feigned its appearance.\n—Referring to the following lines.\nTheir actions were cautious, like winter crossing a river.\n—Every deed was weighed with gravity, as if reluctant, like winter’s trepidation in crossing a river.\nTheir demeanor was hesitant, as if fearing neighbors.\n—Their advance and retreat were constrained, like a criminal fearing the scrutiny of others.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: *Returning to the Root***\n\nSolemn, as if a guest.\n—Like a guest fearing his host, dignified and unassuming in all actions.\n\nDissolved, as if ice about to melt.\n—*\"Dissolved\"* means to disperse; *\"melt\"* means to vanish.\nAbandoning passions, discarding desires, daily emptied of self.\n\nGenuine, as if uncarved wood.\n—*\"Genuine\"* means thick and pure; *\"uncarved\"* means formless.\nGuarding the spirit within, without ornament, unadorned.\n\nVast, as if a valley.\n—*\"Vast\"* means expansive; *\"valley\"* means hollow.\nWithout virtue or fame, yet encompassing all.\n\nTurbulent, as if muddy.\n—*\"Turbulent\"* means steadfast in truth; *\"muddy\"* means unrefined.\nIn harmony with the multitude, not self-exalted.\n\nWho can still the muddy and let it settle, slowly clear?\n—*\"Who\"* refers to none but the Dao.\n\nWho can remain still and let motion arise, slowly nurture life?\n—*\"Who\"* refers to none but the Dao.\n\nThose who preserve this Way do not seek fullness.\n—For only by not being full can one remain hidden, unadorned.\n\nOnly those who are not full can avoid the new and the finished.\n—*\"Hidden\"* means concealing brilliance; *\"finished\"* means valuing fame.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: *Returning to the Root* – *Extreme Emptiness***\n\nAt its peak, the Sage is known only by his existence.\n—The *\"Sage\"* refers to the nameless ruler of antiquity.\nThose below know of his existence but do not serve him in formality, remaining pure and simple.\n\nNext, they cherish and praise him.\n—His virtue is visible, his benevolence worthy of praise, so they love and honor him.\n\nNext, they fear him.\n—Laws and punishments are established to govern them.\n\nNext, they scorn him.\n—Excessive prohibitions and burdens make them lose sincerity, so they mock him.\n\nWhen the ruler’s trust is insufficient, the people respond with deceit.\n—If the ruler lacks integrity, the people answer with dishonesty and deceit.\n\nThus, the Sage values speech.\n—For the Sage of antiquity, even actions are held with reverence, lest they stray from the Dao and lose naturalness.\n\nWhen deeds are accomplished and affairs settled,\n—the land is at peace—\nthe people say, *\"It was only natural.\"*\n—The people do not recognize the Sage’s pure virtue, attributing it merely to fate.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: *The Decay of Customs***\n\nWhen the Great Dao is abandoned,仁 *rén* and 義 *yì* arise.\n—In the age of the Great Dao, filial sons and loyal subjects were unseen within families.\nOnly when the Dao is abandoned and wickedness flourishes do仁 *rén* and 義 *yì* become topics of discussion.\n\nWhen cleverness and cunning emerge, great deceit follows.\n—The wise ruler values speech over virtue, form over substance, and the people respond with falsehood and trickery.\n\nWhen familial bonds fracture,孝 *xiào* and 慈 *cí* appear.\n—When parents and children are estranged,孝 *xiào* and 慈 *cí* arise to nurture them.\n\nWhen the state is in chaos, loyal ministers emerge.\n—When governance fails, superiors and inferiors clash, and the wicked vie for power, loyal ministers then arise to rectify the ruler.\n\nThis is to say: in the age of true peace, there are no virtuous men—\n—desires are absent, so purity is unknown;\neach cleanses themselves, yet chastity is unrecognized.\n\nThe Sage of the Great Dao extinguishes仁 *rén* and 義 *yì*,\n—just as at high noon, the sun’s brilliance obscures the stars.\n孝 *xiào* and 慈 *cí* vanish.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: *Restoring Primordial Simplicity***\n\nAbandon the Sage’s artifices.\n—Reject the Sage’s institutions and return to the origin, as the Five Emperors did before writing was invented.\n—Before Cangjie created script, men used knotted cords—no false distinctions.\n\nDiscard cleverness.\n—Reject cunning and return to non-action.\n\nThe people prosper a hundredfold.\n—Farming is cultivated, governance is impartial.\n\nAbandon仁 *rén* and 義 *yì*.\n—Reject the appearance of benevolence and the pretense of righteousness.\n\nThe people return to孝 *xiào* and 慈 *cí*.\n—Morality becomes pure and unadorned.\n\nAbandon artifice and discard profit.\n—Reject deceitful cleverness that confuses truth.\n—Close the paths of greed and shut the gates of power.\n\nThen thieves and robbers will vanish.\n—When governance is pure above, corruption cannot take root below.\n\nThese three things—\n—That is, the three matters above that must be abandoned.\n\nBecause writing is insufficient—\n—Because writing is insufficient to teach the people,\nThus, one must have what belongs to them.\n—As follows below.\n\n*\"Seeing the unadorned, embracing the uncarved.\"*\n—*\"Seeing the unadorned\"* means to hold fast to simplicity and truth, not to adorn with artifice.\n—*\"Embracing the uncarved\"* means to reveal sincerity and plainness to those below, so they may follow as a model.\n\n*\"Few desires, little private gain.\"*\n—*\"Few desires\"* means to correct selfishness by being selfless.\n—*\"Little private gain\"* means to know contentment.\n\n**Chapter Twenty: On the Abandonment of Learning**\n—To abandon learning is to reject false teachings that do not align with the Dao.\n\n*\"No worries.\"*\n—By removing superficiality, worries vanish.\n\n*\"‘Yes’ and ‘Ah’—how far apart are they?\"*\n—Both are responses, yet how distant they are—\nThe age despises sincerity and values artifice.\n\n*\"Good and evil—how far apart are they?\"*\n—Good is harmony and praise; evil is contention and strife.\nHow far apart can they be?\nThe age despises loyalty and uprightness, favoring flattery and deceit.\n\n*\"What people fear, one must fear.\"*\n—People refer to the Dao.\nWhat people fear is the ruler who does not abandon learning.\nOne must fear this—\nFor it leads to flattery, killing the virtuous and the wise.\n\n*\"How vast and endless it is!\"*\n—Some say the common people are chaotic, ever striving to learn and adorn themselves without end.\n\n*\"The crowd bustles and revels.\"*\n—Bustling means licentious, overflowing with desires.\n\n*\"Like feasting on the finest meats.\"*\n—Like a starving man craving the feast of *tài láo*—\nEver hungry, never satisfied.\n\n*\"Like springtime ascending a terrace.\"*\n—In spring, yin and yang intermingle, stirring all things—\nAscending the terrace, observing, intoxicated with desire.\n\n*\"I alone stand in dread, as yet unmanifest.\"*\n—I alone remain tranquil, without the stirrings of desire.\n\n*\"Like an infant before it speaks.\"*\n—Like a child before it can answer questions.\n\n*\"Wandering, as if without destination.\"*\n—I wander like a rustic from the remote countryside, nowhere to turn.\n\n*\"The crowd all have excess.\"*\n—The crowd has excess wealth for indulgence, excess cleverness for deceit.\n\n*\"I alone seem abandoned.\"*\n—I alone seem cast aside, as if lacking.\n\n*\"I, the heart of the foolish man.\"*\n—I do not follow the crowd, steadfast in one path, unmoved—\nLike the heart of the foolish man.\n\n*\"Dim and indistinct.\"*\n—Without distinction.\n\n*\"The crowd is bright and clear.\"*\n—Bright and discerning.\n\n*\"I alone am dimmed.\"*\n—Like darkness.\n\n*\"The crowd is sharp and swift.\"*\n—Swift and hasty.\n\n*\"I alone am stifled and still.\"*\n—Stifled, without division.\n\n*\"Vast as the sea.\"*\n—I alone drift, vast as the flowing river and sea,\nUnknown in its depths.\n\n*\"Drifting, as if without end.\"*\n—I alone drift, drifting like wind-borne dust,\nWithout rest.\n\n*\"My purpose dwells in the realm of the spirit.\"*\n\n*\"The crowd all have something to rely on.\"*\n—They rely on artificiality.\n\nWhile I alone am obstinate.\n—I alone do without action.\n\nSeeming vulgar.\n—Vulgar, as if deficient.\n\nI alone differ from others.\n—I alone differ from people.\n\nYet I honor the Mother.\n—*Food*, meaning *use*.\n*Mother*, meaning *Dao*.\nI alone honor the use of the Dao.\n\n**Chapter 21: Empty Heart**\nThe bearing of great virtue.\n—*Great*, vast.\nThose with great virtue contain all, receive all,\nBear defilement and filth in humility.\nOnly the Dao is followed.\n—*Only*, solely.\nThose with great virtue do not follow the customs of the world,\nBut solely follow the Dao.\n\nThe Dao as a thing is elusive and fleeting.\n—The Dao, among all things, is elusive and fleeting,\nComing and going without fixed form.\n\nFleeting and elusive, yet within it there is form.\n—The Dao, though fleeting and elusive, is the pattern for all things.\n\nElusive and fleeting, yet within it there is substance.\n—The Dao, though elusive and fleeting, contains the vital *qi* that gives rise to form and transformation.\n\nMysterious and dark, yet within it there is essence.\n—The Dao, though mysterious and dark, contains the refined and luminous interaction of yin and yang.\n\nIts essence is most true.\n—Speaking of preserving the essence and *qi*, its subtlety is truly authentic, without ornament.\n\nWithin it there is sincerity.\n—The Dao conceals its deeds and hides its name; its sincerity lies within.\n\nFrom ancient times to now, its name does not fade.\n—*From*, since.\nSince ancient times until now, the Dao remains ever-present.\n\nTo observe the origin of all things.\n—*Observe*, receive.\n*Origin*, beginning.\nThe Dao receives and gives birth to all things, from which they receive *qi*.\n\nHow do I know that all things are thus?\n—I know how all things receive *qi* from the Dao.\n\nBecause of this.\n—*This*, the present.\nBecause of this, all things receive the Dao’s essence and *qi*,\nAnd thus come to life, move, and act—\nWithout the Dao, they would not exist.\n\n**Chapter 22: Increased Humility**\nBend, and you remain whole.\n—Bend yourself to follow others, not asserting your own will,\nAnd you preserve your integrity.\n\nCrooked, yet straight.\n—Though you bend yourself to accommodate others,\nOver time, you attain true uprightness.\n\nLow, yet full.\n—The lowly receive what the earth holds,\nAnd thus virtue flows to them.\n\nWorn, yet renewed.\n—Though you endure hardship and diminish yourself,\nOthers respect you, and over time you renew.\n\nTake little, yet gain much.\n—By taking little, you obtain much.\n\nThe Dao aids the humble; the divine trusts the empty.\nTake much, and you are confused.\n—Those with much wealth are confused by what they possess,\nThose with much learning are confused by what they hear.\n\nThus, the Sage holds to One as the model for all under heaven.\n—*Holds*, guards.\nThe Sage guards the One and thereby knows all things,\nAnd so can serve as the model.\n\nNot seeing oneself, one becomes clear.\n—The Sage does not gaze beyond what the eye can see,\nBut uses the vision of all under heaven,\nAnd thus becomes enlightened.\n\nNot asserting oneself, one becomes manifest.\n—The Sage does not insist on being right while others are wrong,\nAnd thus becomes illustrious in the world.\n\nNot praising oneself, one achieves merit.\n—*Praise*, take.\nThe Sage’s virtue spreads without taking credit,\nAnd thus achieves merit for all under heaven.\n\nNot boasting, one endures.\n—*Boast*, magnify.\nThe Sage does not exalt themselves,\nAnd thus endure without peril.\n\nOnly by not contending does one surpass all contention.\n—This means that under heaven, neither the virtuous nor the unvirtuous\nCan contend with one who does not contend.\n\nWas it not true that the ancients said,\n*\"Bend, and you remain whole\"*?\nWas this not a sincere saying?\n—*Sincere*, real.\nThose who truly practice bending and following\nReturn to their roots without harm,\nAnd preserve their bodies for their parents.\n\n**Chapter 23: Empty and Void**\nRarely speaking, returning to nature.\n\n*—Rarely speaking is to love speech.\nTo love speech is the Way of nature.\nA gusting wind does not last the morning,\nA sudden rain does not last the day.\n—*Gusting wind*, swift wind.\n*Sudden rain*, violent rain.\nSwift speech cannot endure,\nViolence cannot last.\nWho does this?\n—Who makes the gusting wind and sudden rain?\nIt is the work of Heaven and Earth.\n—Heaven and Earth cannot endure long.\n—They do not last from morning to evening.\nHow much less can mortals?\n—Heaven and Earth, though most divine, cannot make gusting winds and sudden rains last from morning to evening—how much less can mortals strive to be violent and hasty?\n\nThus, those who follow the Dao\n—*Follow*, act in accordance with.\nShould act like the Dao—calm, not like gusting winds and sudden rains.\nThose who align with the Dao\n—*Those who align with the Dao*, those who love the Dao, are said to be \"in accord with the Dao.\"\nAlign with virtue\n—*Virtue*, those who love virtue.\nThose who align with virtue are said to be \"in accord with virtue.\"\nAlign with loss\n—*Loss*, those who rely on self and lose others.\nThose who align with loss are said to be \"in accord with loss.\"\nThose who align with the Dao, the Dao delights in them.\n—Those in accord with the Dao, the Dao also delights in them.\nThose who align with virtue, virtue delights in them.\n—Those in accord with virtue, virtue also delights in them.\nThose who align with loss, loss delights in them.\n—Those in accord with loss, loss also delights in them.\n\nTrust is insufficient here.\n—The ruler’s trust is insufficient with the people, and the people respond with insufficiency.\nThere is no trust here.\n—This speaks of things of like kind returning to one another, voices resonating together:\nDragons gather dragons, winds follow tigers,\nWater flows to moisture, fire seeks dryness—\nThus is the nature of things.\n\n**Chapter 24: The Gratitude of Bitterness**\n*The stiff-legged cannot stand.*\n\n「――*Dà* (跂), this is *jìn* (进).\n—To say that those who covet power and crave fame seek advancement in功 and荣, yet this cannot establish them firmly in body or Dao/Way.\nThose who *kuà* (跨) cannot proceed.\n—They deem themselves noble and thus *kuà* (跨) over the people, making them unable to move forward.\n\nThose who *zì jiàn* (自见) are blind.\n—People see their own appearance and deem it good, see their own actions and believe them in accord with the Dao/Way, yet they do not know their own ugliness or the vulgarity of their conduct.\n\nThose who *zì shì* (自是) are not illuminated.\n—They believe themselves correct yet contradict others, and the people obstruct them so they cannot shine forth.\n\nThose who *zì fá* (自伐) have no merit.\n—When they boast of their own achievements and beautify their own merits, they lose the true merit they hold for others.\n\nThose who *zì jīn* (自矜) do not endure.\n—Those who love to boast of their own greatness cannot last long.\nIn terms of the Dao/Way, they are called *yúshí* (余食) and *zhuāngxíng* (赘行).\n—*Zhuāng* (赘), this is *tān* (贪). Those who indulge in self-praise and boastful actions in governing the state are said to consume surplus *shí* (食) and engage in superfluous *xíng* (行).\nThus, many revile them.\n—Such people, when in office, act arbitrarily and harm others, so nothing they do escapes censure.\n\nHence, those who follow the Dao/Way do not dwell there.\n—This means those who follow the Dao/Way do not remain in such a state.\n\n**Chapter 25: The Symbol of the Undefinable**\nThere is something mixed and complete, born before Heaven and Earth.\n—This refers to the Dao/Way, which is formless yet gives rise to all things, existing before Heaven and Earth.\n\nSilent and boundless, it stands alone yet never alters.\n—Silent, it has no sound or voice; boundless, it is empty and formless.\nStanding alone, it has no equal or pair.\nNot altering, its transformations are constant.\n\nIt moves in cycles yet never falters.\n—The Dao/Way pervades Heaven and Earth without exclusion, in the sun it does not wither, in the shade it does not decay—it penetrates everywhere without danger or peril.\n\nIt can be the mother of all under Heaven.\n—The Dao/Way nourishes all things; their essence and *qi* are like a mother nurturing her child.\n\nI do not know its name—it is called the Dao/Way.\n—I do not see its form or appearance; I know not how else to name it. Observing that all things arise from it, I call it the Dao/Way.\n\nIf forced to name it, I would say *Dà* (大).\n—*Dà* (大) is vast yet without limit, encompassing yet without boundary, containing all without exclusion.\n\n*Dà* (大) is said to be *shì* (逝).\n—Its greatness is not like Heaven’s permanence above nor Earth’s steadfastness below; rather, it departs and has no fixed place.\n\n*Shì* (逝) is said to be *yuǎn* (远).\n—Farness speaks of the boundless, its *qi* pervading Heaven and Earth without obstruction.\n\n*Yuǎn* (远) is said to be *fǎn* (反).\n—Though far, it does not vanish utterly but returns to the human body.\n\nThus, the Dao/Way is great, Heaven is great, Earth is great, the King is great.\n—The Dao/Way’s greatness encompasses all Heaven and Earth without limit.\nHeaven’s greatness covers all without exclusion.\nEarth’s greatness bears all without constraint.\nThe King’s greatness governs all without tyranny.\n\nWithin the *yù* (域) are the Four Great.\n—The Four Great are the Dao/Way, Heaven, Earth, and the King.\nAll that has a title or name is not its ultimate expression.\nThe Dao/Way has origins, and only when it has origins can it be called the Dao/Way. Thus, this is the Dao/Way among the Four Great.\nIt is not as great as the Dao/Way without title.\n\nThe Dao/Way without title cannot be named as *yù* (域).\n—Heaven, Earth, and the King all exist within the Dao/Way without title.\nThus, it is said that within the *yù* (域) are the Four Great, and the King is one of them.\n—Within the Eight Extremes, the Four Great exist, and the King is one of them.\n\nHumans emulate Earth.\n—Humans should emulate Earth’s tranquility, gentleness, and yielding.\nWhen planted, it yields the Five Grains; when dug, it produces sweet springs.\nIt labors yet does not complain, has merit yet does not dominate.\n\nEarth emulates Heaven.\n—Heaven is serene and motionless, giving yet seeking no recompense, fostering and growing all things without taking anything back.\n\nHeaven emulates the Dao/Way.\n—The Dao/Way is pure and silent, acting without speech, its subtle *qi* forming all things naturally.\n\nThe Dao/Way emulates *zìrán* (自然).\n—The Dao/Way’s nature is *zìrán* (自然); it follows nothing external.\n\n**Chapter 26: The Weight of Virtue**\n*Chóng* (重) is the root of *qīng* (轻).\n—When the ruler does not hold virtue in high regard, it is not honored. In governing oneself, if virtue is not cherished, the spirit is lost. Flowers of grasses and trees are light, so they wither and fall; roots are heavy, so they endure long.\n\n*Jìng* (静) is the master of *zào* (躁).\n—If the ruler is not tranquil, authority is lost. In governing oneself, if one is not tranquil, the body is in peril. The dragon is tranquil, thus able to transform; the tiger is restless, thus its life is cut short.\n\nThus, the Sage acts daily without departing from *zīzhòng* (辎重).\n—*Zī* (辎), this is *jìng* (静). The Sage, in following the Dao/Way, never leaves his stillness and weight.\n\nThough adorned with splendor and resorts, he remains detached and aloof.\n—*Róngguàn* (荣观) refers to palaces and halls (宫卦, 上加门); *yànchù* (燕处) is where the queen consorts.\nDetached, he avoids them far and does not dwell there.\n\nHow can the sovereign of ten thousand chariots do otherwise?\n\n「――*Nàihé* (奈何), this is the language of lamenting the ruler’s suffering and pain. The *wànchéng zhǔ* (万乘之主) refers to the king.\nYet he lightens himself against the world.\n—The king, though supreme, acts with his body in lightness and restlessness toward the world.\n\n*Cìshí* (疾时) means the king indulges in excessive luxury and licentiousness.\nLightness leads to losing his ministers.\n—If the king acts in lightness and dissipation, he loses his ministers.\nIf he dissipates his own body, he loses his vital essence.\n\nRestlessness leads to losing his throne.\n—If the king acts in haste and impetuosity, he loses his royal authority.\nIf he agitates his own body, he loses his spirit and vitality.\n\n**Chapter 27: *Qiaoyòng* (巧用)**\nThe Sage moves without leaving tracks.\n—The Sage who follows the Dao/Way seeks it within himself, never descending from his hall nor stepping beyond his door, thus leaving no tracks.\n\nHis words are without flaw or censure.\n—Good speech is the careful selection of words before they are spoken, so they bear no blemish or fault and transcend all reproach.\n\nHis plans do not require schemings.\n—The Sage who calculates with the Dao/Way adheres to one principle without deviation; his plans are few, so he needs no schemings or strategies to discern them.\n\nHis closing is without locks yet cannot be opened.\n—The Sage who closes his emotions and desires with the Dao/Way does so not like doors and gates that can be unlocked, but with a steadfastness that cannot be breached.\n\nHis binding is without cords yet cannot be undone.\n—The Sage who binds matters with the Dao/Way does so with the heart, not like ropes that can be severed.\n\nThus, the Sage is always the savior of men.\n—The Sage constantly teaches loyalty and filial piety to save men from their fate.\nHence, he abandons no one.\n—He ensures that nobles and commoners each find their proper place.\n\nAlways the savior of things.\n—The Sage teaches the people to follow the four seasons to save all things from harm.\nHence, he abandons nothing.\n\nHe does not demean stone nor honor jade, viewing them as one.\nThis is called *xímíng* (袭明).\n—The Sage’s skill in saving men and things is to embrace the luminous Dao/Way.\nThus, the good man is not the teacher of the unworthy.\n—The Sage takes those who practice goodness as his disciples.\n\nThe unworthy are the material for the good.\n—*Zī* (资) means \"use.\" Though a man may be unworthy, the Sage still guides him to goodness, that he may be put to use.\n\nHe does not regard his teacher as precious.\n—He lacks no aid.\n\nHe does not cherish his material.\n—He has no means to employ them.\n\nThough wise, he is greatly deluded.\n—Though he may consider himself wise, such a man is in great confusion.\n\nThis is called *yàomiào* (要妙).\n—To grasp this meaning is to know the subtle and essential Dao/Way.\n\n**Chapter 28: *Fǎnpǔ* (反朴)**\nKnow its male and guard its female, and you become the valley of the world.\n—Male signifies the exalted; female, the humble. Though a man knows his own exaltation, he must guard it with humility, yielding to the weak and gentle. As he does so, the world flows toward him like water into a deep valley.\n\nTo be the valley of the world is to have virtue ever constant.\n—He who remains humble like a deep valley has virtue that never departs from him.\n\nReturning to the state of the infant.\n—He constantly returns to the simplicity of an infant, guileless yet knowing nothing.\n\nKnow its white and guard its black, and you become the model of the world.\n—White signifies clarity; black, obscurity. Though a man knows his own clarity, he must guard it with obscurity, like darkness that conceals nothing. As he does so, he becomes the model for the world, and virtue remains with him.\n\nTo be the model of the world is to have virtue ever unerring.\n—He who becomes the model for the world has virtue that never strays.\n\nReturning to the state of the *wújí* (无极).\n—When virtue does not stray, it leads to eternal life and boundless longevity, returning the body to the limitless.\n\nKnow its honor and guard its humiliation, and you become the valley of the world.\n—Honor signifies nobility; humiliation, filth. Though a man knows his own nobility, he must guard it with filth, like a deep ravine. As he does so, the world flows toward him like water into a deep valley.\n\nTo be the valley of the world is to have virtue ever complete.\n—Complete, here, means \"cessation.\" He who becomes the valley of the world has virtue that ceases not within him.\n\nReturning to the state of *pǔ* (朴).\n—He must return to the simplicity of his own nature, unadorned by artificiality.\n\n*Pǔ* (朴) scattered becomes the vessel.\n—When the simplicity of all things is scattered, they become useful implements.\nIf the Dao/Way is scattered, it becomes the manifestation of the *shénmíng* (神明), flowing as the sun and moon, dividing into the Five Phases.\n\nThe Sage employs them as officials and leaders.\n—The Sage, in ascending to use them, becomes the chief of all officials.\n\nThus, the great measure does not cut.\n—The Sage, in governing with the great Dao/Way, does not harm the world.\nIn cultivating himself, he governs his desires with the Dao of Heaven, not harming his spirit.\n\n**Chapter 29: *Wúwéi* (无为)**\nIf one wishes to take the world,\n—To desire to be the ruler of the world—\n\nAnd yet acts to do so,\n—To govern the people with contrivance—\n\nI see that he cannot achieve it.\n—I see that he has not yet understood the Dao of Heaven and the hearts of men.\nHeaven’s Dao abhors turmoil and filth; men’s hearts abhor excessive desires.\n\nThe world is a divine vessel, not to be governed by contrivance.\n—Vessel (*qì* 器) refers to things. Man is the divine vessel of the world.\nDivine vessels prefer tranquility and cannot be governed by contrivance.\n\nTo act is to ruin it.\n—To govern with contrivance spoils its natural essence.\n\nTo grasp is to lose it.\n—To forcefully impose teachings upon men is to lose their true nature, giving rise to deceit and falsehood.\n\nThus, things either act or follow.\n—When the superior acts, the inferior must follow.\n\nEither warm or chill.\n—Warm (*wěn* 温) and chill (*chuī* 吹) are opposites. Where there is warmth, there must also be chill.\n\nEither strong or weak.\n—Where there is strength, there must also be weakness.\n\nEither bear or destroy.\n—Bear (*zài* 载) means \"to support\"; destroy (*huī* 隳) means \"to endanger.\" Where there is support, there must also be peril.\n\nThis shows that the ruler of men cannot govern the world or himself by contrivance.\nThus, the Sage avoids excess, avoids extravagance, avoids presumption.\n\n---\n\nThe extreme is gluttony for sensual pleasures.\n—*Vain* (甚) refers to excess in sensual indulgence.\n\nExtravagance is in attire, food, and drink.\n—*Extravagance* (奢) pertains to elaborate clothing, sumptuous food, and excessive drink.\n\nPresumption is in palaces and pavilions.\n—*Presumption* (泰) refers to grandiose palaces and ornamental towers.\n\nTo abandon these three, to dwell in moderation, to act without contrivance—then the world will transform itself naturally.\n\n**Chapter 30: *Jian* (俭, Frugality) – The Third**\nTo assist the sovereign with the Dao\n—That is, for the sovereign to reinforce himself with the Dao.\n\nNot to coerce the world with arms.\n—The sovereign who aids himself with the Dao does not rely on military might; instead, he aligns with Heaven, trusts in virtue, and the enemy submits of its own accord.\n\nHis undertakings are met with favor and return.\n—His actions are met with reciprocity; he bears no resentment toward others.\n\nWhere the army encamps, thorns and brambles grow.\n—Agricultural labor is neglected; fields lie unplowed.\n\nAfter great armies, there are years of calamity.\n—Heaven responds with malevolent *qi*, harming the five grains. The five grains are all damaged, and the people suffer.\n\nThe skilled warrior is decisive.\n—The adept in warfare must be resolute and not hesitate.\n\nYet he does not seek strength through force.\n—He does not claim strength as a virtue.\n\nDecisive yet unboastful.\n—He acts decisively but remains humble, not arrogant.\n\nDecisive yet not self-praising.\n—He acts decisively yet defers praise, lest he take credit for himself.\n\nDecisive yet not proud.\n—Pride is deceit. He acts decisively without deceiving others.\n\nDecisive yet without compulsion.\n—He acts decisively with sincerity, not out of coercion.\n\nDecisive yet not domineering.\n—He acts decisively without relying on brute force, heavy armor, or aggression against others.\n\nWhen things reach their peak, they decline.\n—Grasses and trees, at their height, wither and fall. Humans, at their peak, grow old and decay.\n\nThus, those who speak of strength cannot remain vigorous.\n—This is called *not-Dao*.\n\nNot-Dao leads to early ruin.\n—Those who do not follow the Dao perish young.\n\n**Chapter 31: *Yan* (偃, Laying Down Arms)**\nFine arms are an inauspicious instrument.\n—*Conflicting* (祥) means \"auspicious.\" Arms disturb the spirit, disrupt harmonious *qi*, and are an instrument of the unvirtuous.\n\nThey should not be adorned.\n—When arms are wielded, harm is inevitable; all things resist them.\n\nThus, those who possess the Dao do not dwell upon them.\n—The virtuous do not reside in lands of war.\n\nThe gentleman, in peace, values the left.\n—The left represents the yielding and weak.\n\nIn war, he values the right.\n—The right represents the strong and resolute.\n\nThis shows that the Way of arms and the Way of the gentleman are opposites, and what they value differs.\n\nArms are an inauspicious instrument.\n—Arms are an unvirtuous tool.\n\nThey are not the instrument of the gentleman.\n—They are not held in esteem by the virtuous.\n\nThey are used only when unavoidable.\n—That is, when faced with decline, rebellion, or calamity threatening the people, they are employed for self-defense.\n\nSerenity and tranquility are supreme.\n—*Tranquility* (惔) is alternatively read as *ran* (然). The ideal is to not covet land, people, or treasure.\n\nVictory is not glorified.\n—Even if victorious, one does not take it as personal gain.\n\nThose who glorify victory delight in killing.\n—To rejoice in victory is to delight in slaughter.\n\nHe who delights in killing cannot achieve his aims in the world.\n—For a ruler to take pleasure in killing is to act tyrannically, executing at will. This cannot be tolerated in the world.\n\nAuspicious rites favor the left.\n—The left is the position of life.\n\nInauspicious rites favor the right.\n—The right aligns with the *yin* path of death.\n\nThe *Pian* (偏) General resides on the left.\n—The *Pian* General, though lowly, occupies the *yang* position because he does not wield absolute authority over life and death.\n\nThe *Shang* (上) General resides on the right.\n—The *Shang* General, being honored, occupies the right, signifying his role in execution.\n\nThis is treated with funeral rites.\n—The *Shang* General, on the right, follows funeral customs, as death is honored with *yin*.\n\nThe multitude of slain are mourned with sorrowful weeping.\n—This reflects a ruler’s moral failing—his inability to transform others through virtue, leading to the slaughter of the innocent.\n\nVictory is treated with funeral rites.\n—In antiquity, victorious generals observed mourning rites, occupying the funeral position. They wore plain mourning attire and wept, demonstrating that the virtuous value morality over warfare and do not rejoice in bloodshed. They grieve because they foresee future wars.\n\n**Chapter 32: *Sheng* (圣, Sacred Virtue)**\nThe Dao is ever nameless.\n—The Dao manifests as both *yin* and *yang*, expands and contracts, preserves and destroys; thus, it has no fixed name.\n\nThough crude and simple, it is not subdued by the world.\n—The Dao, though subtle and formless, is so profound that the world dare not enslave it.\n\nIf lords and kings could uphold it, all things would submit of their own accord.\n—If lords and kings could preserve the Dao and act without contrivance, all things would naturally revere and obey their virtue.\n\nHeaven and Earth unite, and sweet dew descends.\n—When a ruler’s actions harmonize with Heaven, auspicious signs appear, such as the descent of sweet dew.\n\nThe people govern themselves without command.\n—When Heaven bestows blessings, no orders are needed; all things naturally align in balance.\n\nOnly then does naming begin.\n—*Beginning* (始) refers to the Dao. *Naming* refers to all things. The Dao, though nameless, governs the named; the formless governs the formed.\n\nOnce names are established,\n—*Established* (既) means \"exhausted.\" Once all things have names, they develop desires and stray from the Dao, losing their virtue, and thus bring ruin upon themselves.\n\nHeaven will know this.\n—If a person abandons the Dao and pursues virtue, Heaven will recognize it.\n\nThis is how one avoids peril.\n—Heaven’s recognition brings divine protection, ensuring safety.\n\nThe Dao in the world is like rivers and valleys to the sea.\n—The Dao’s relationship with the world is akin to how rivers and valleys flow into the sea.\n\n**Chapter 33: *Bian* (辩, Discerning Virtue)**\nTo know others is wisdom.\n\n「――To know others’ joys and dislikes is wisdom.\nTo know oneself is clarity. ――When a person can know themselves and discern their virtues and faults, this is called *reflection without sound* (反听无声) and *introspection without form* (内视无形), hence clarity.\n\nTo overcome others is strength.\n――To overcome others is merely to rely on force.\n\nTo overcome oneself is might. ――When a person can conquer their own desires and passions, none in the world can contend with them, hence might.\n\nTo know contentment is wealth. ――When a person knows contentment as contentment, they long preserve blessings and fortune, hence wealth.\n\nTo act resolutely is to have resolve. ――When a person exerts strength to do good, they have resolve in the Dao, and the Dao also responds to them.\n\nTo remain steadfast in one’s place is longevity. ――When a person can regulate themselves and not lose their natural state, they receive Heaven’s *essence-qi* (精气), thus enduring long.\n\nTo die without perishing is long life. ――With eyes not gazing wantonly, ears not listening recklessly, and mouth not speaking falsely, they incur no grievance in the world, hence great longevity.\n\n**Chapter 34: *Ren Cheng* (任成, Surrendering Fulfilment)**\nWhen one holds to the great *image* (大象) — the Dao —\n――*Holds* (执) means to uphold; *image* (象) refers to the Dao. The Sage upholds the great Dao, and thus all people in the world turn their hearts toward it.\nthe world turns to it,\n――*Image* (象) also signifies the manifestation of Heaven’s *spirit-light* (神明). When the Sage governs their own person, Heaven sends its spirit-light to dwell with them.\nand yet no harm is done — peace and tranquillity prevail.\n――When all things turn to it without injury, the state is secure, the family harmonious, and great peace is achieved.\nWhen one governs their person without harming Heaven’s spirit-light, their body is at ease and their life prolonged.\n\nLike music and bait, the wandering guest will stay.\n――*Bait* (饵) means allurement; the *wandering guest* (过客) is one who lingers. When a person finds delight in the allurement of the Dao, they remain steadfast.\nThe steadfast one departs from excess and dwells in simplicity, drifting like a wandering guest.\nThe Dao’s utterance is insipid, lacking taste.\n――The Dao enters and exits through speech, yet it is bland and not like the five flavors — sour, bitter, sweet, salty, or pungent.\nTo gaze upon it is insufficient to see.\n――*Sufficient* (足) here means virtue. The Dao is formless and cannot be perceived like the five colors — green, yellow, red, white, or black.\nTo listen to it is insufficient to hear.\n――The Dao is not like the five tones — *gong* (宫), *shang* (商), *jue* (角), *zhi* (征), or *yu* (羽) — that can be heard.\nTo use it is without exhaustion.\n――Using the Dao to govern a state brings security and prosperity to the people; using it to govern oneself prolongs life without end.\n\n**Chapter 36: *Wei Ming* (微明, Subtle Clarity)**\nWhen one is about to contract (翕),\n――Those who first expand (张) excessively will later seek to contract.\nthey must first solidify its expansion.\n――Those who first strengthen (强) excessively will later seek to weaken.\nWhen one is about to weaken,\n――Those who first rise (兴) excessively will later seek to decline.\nthey must first solidify its decline.\n――Those who first give (与) excessively will later seek to take away.\nWhen one is about to take away,\n――This is called *subtle clarity* (微明).\nthe soft and weak prevail over the hard and strong.\n――The soft and weak endure long, while the hard and strong perish first.\nFish cannot be plucked from the depths.\n――When fish are plucked from the depths, they lose their strength and cannot be controlled again.\n\nThe state’s sharpest tools should not be displayed to the people.\n――*Sharpest tools* (利器) are the implements of governance. When governing a state, the ruler should not reveal their methods to officials.\nWhen governing oneself, the Dao should not be shown to those unworthy.\n\n**Chapter 37: *Zhi Zheng* (治政, Governing by the Dao)**\nThe Dao is ever without action.\n――The Dao abides in non-action (无为) as its constant principle.\nYet it is without failing to act.\n――If rulers can uphold the Dao, all things will naturally transform and benefit them.\nWhen transformation is complete and yet they wish to act,\nI shall restrain them with the *primordial simplicity* (无名之朴).\n――*I* (吾) refers to the Dao. The Dao, through transformation, benefits them.\nIf they again wish to act with cunning and deceit,\nthe ruler should restrain them with virtue.\nThe Dao, the *primordial simplicity*, will also not desire to act.\n――The Dao, through virtue, restrains them, and the people will also not desire to act. The ruler should guide them with purity and stillness.\nThe world will then settle itself.\n――Those who act thus will bring the world to order and peace.\n\n**Chapter 38: *Lun De* (论德, Discussing Virtue)**\nThe highest virtue does not claim virtue.\n――The highest virtue refers to the ancient sovereigns without titles, whose virtue was boundless and supreme, hence the term *highest virtue*.\nTo not claim virtue means they did not teach virtue to the people, but followed nature’s course, nurturing life and preserving it, their virtue unseen, hence not claiming it.\nThus they truly had virtue.\n――Their virtue harmonized with Heaven and Earth, blending with the *flowing qi* (和气), and the people were thereby preserved whole.\n\nThe lower virtue does not lose virtue.\n\nThe lower virtue refers to the titled and posthumously honored sovereigns, whose virtue does not reach the highest, hence the term *lower virtue*.\nTo not lose virtue means their virtue is visible, and their achievements are worthy of praise.\nThus they truly have virtue.\n――Because of their titles and their own persons.\n\nThe highest virtue acts without action.\n――This means following the Dao in stillness, making no alterations.\nYet it is without contrivance.\n――Meaning they do not rely on titles.\n\nThe lower virtue acts with contrivance.\n――Meaning they issue teachings and govern affairs.\nYet it is with contrivance.\n――Meaning they rely on titles for their own sake.\n\nThe highest benevolence acts with benevolence.\n――The highest benevolence refers to the sovereigns who practice benevolence supremely, hence the term *highest benevolence*.\nTo act with benevolence means to bestow kindness.\nYet it is without contrivance.\n――When deeds are accomplished and affairs established, they do not cling to them.\n\nThe highest righteousness acts with righteousness.\n――This means enforcing righteousness through judgment and severance.\nYet it is with contrivance.\n――Meaning they act to kill men and establish awe, tax the people, and enrich themselves.\n\nThe highest ritual acts with ritual.\n――The highest ritual refers to the sovereigns whose ritual is supreme, hence the term *highest ritual*.\nTo act with ritual means to establish ritual institutions, order, and ceremonial decorum.\nYet none respond to it.\n――Meaning ritual, though ornate, is inwardly decayed, and excessive formality leads to falsehood and turmoil, thus straying from the Dao and being unanswered.\nThen they bare their arms and force compliance.\n――Meaning excessive formality provokes contention between ruler and people, so they resort to coercion.\nThus, when the Dao is lost, virtue arises.\n――Meaning when the Dao declines, virtuous governance emerges.\nWhen virtue is lost, benevolence arises.\n――Meaning when virtue declines, expressions of kindness appear.\nWhen benevolence is lost, righteousness arises.\n――Meaning when benevolence declines, distinctions of right and wrong become clear.\nWhen righteousness is lost, ritual arises.\n――Meaning when righteousness declines, ritual is applied—bestowing gifts and conducting ceremonies.\nRitual, however, is the thinnest expression of loyalty and trust.\n――Meaning when ritual is practiced, its essence—loyalty and trust—becomes increasingly shallow.\nAnd it is the beginning of chaos.\n――Meaning ritual values form over substance, so uprightness diminishes while deceit and disorder grow.\nPretense of knowledge is the superficial aspect of the Dao.\n――Meaning to speak of knowledge without true understanding is the outward show of the Dao.\nAnd the origin of folly.\n――Meaning those who rely on such pretense are the first to lead others into ignorance.\n\nThus, the true sage dwells in substance.\n――The true sage refers to the sovereign who embodies the Dao.\nTo dwell in substance means to abide in sincerity and simplicity.\nNot to dwell in superficiality.\n――Meaning not to dwell in what contradicts the Dao, causing worldly turmoil.\nTo dwell in reality.\n――Meaning to uphold loyalty and trust.\nNot to dwell in pretense.\n――Meaning not to indulge in empty words.\nThus, they discard the latter and embrace the former.\n――Discarding superficiality and embracing substance.\n\n**Chapter 39: *Fa Ben* (法本, The Foundation of Principles)**\nIn ancient times, those who attained the One.\n――\"Ancient\" means the past. The One is the child of the Dao of non-action.\nHeaven, attaining the One, becomes clear.\n――Meaning Heaven, attaining the One, thus manifests its forms in clarity.\nEarth, attaining the One, becomes tranquil.\n――Meaning Earth, attaining the One, thus remains stable and does not sway.\nThe Spirit, attaining the One, becomes numinous.\n――Meaning the Spirit, attaining the One, thus manifests its transformative power without form.\nThe Valley, attaining the One, becomes full.\n――Meaning the Valley, attaining the One, thus remains full without depletion.\nAll things, attaining the One, come to life.\n――Meaning all things depend on the Dao to manifest.\nThe feudal lords and kings, attaining the One, make the world upright.\n――Meaning the feudal lords and kings, attaining the One, thus establish order in the world.\n\nIf they push it to its limit:\nHeaven, without clarity, would fear collapse.\n――Meaning Heaven must balance yin and yang, day and night—if it only seeks clarity without moderation, it would fear fragmentation and cease to be Heaven.\nEarth, without tranquility, would fear eruption.\n――Meaning Earth must balance high and low, firm and yielding, the five phases—if it only seeks stillness without moderation, it would fear upheaval and cease to be Earth.\nThe Spirit, without numinosity, would fear exhaustion.\n――Meaning the Spirit must cycle through kingship, ministers, imprisonment, death, rest, and decay—if it only seeks vitality without moderation, it would fear depletion and cease to be Spirit.\nThe Valley, without fullness, would fear exhaustion.\n――Meaning the Valley must balance fullness and emptiness—if it only seeks abundance without moderation, it would fear depletion and cease to be the Valley.\nAll things, without life, would fear annihilation.\n――Meaning all things must follow the cycles of birth and death—if they only seek life without moderation, they would fear extinction and cease to be things.\nThe feudal lords and kings, without humility, would fear ruin.\n――Meaning the feudal lords and kings must humble themselves and serve the people—if they only seek exaltation without moderation, they would fear downfall and lose their position.\n\nThus, nobility must take humility as its foundation.\n――Meaning true nobility must root itself in what is lowly; like Yu and Shi who tilled the fields, or Shun who worked with Yao, or the Duke of Zhou who lived in humble dwellings.\nExaltation must take humility as its base.\n――Meaning true elevation must be built upon what is lowly, just as walls are constructed by first digging foundations—without a firm base, even the highest structures will eventually collapse.\n\nThus, the feudal lords and kings refer to themselves as \"lonely and bereft,\" unable to be the hub of all spokes.\n――\"Lonely\" signifies isolation; \"bereft\" signifies inability to unite all like the hub of a wheel.\nIs this not taking humility as the foundation?\n――Meaning even the most exalted rulers acknowledge their dependence on humility.\nThis is to enlighten the people.\n――Is it not so?\n\n――Lamenting words. Hence, when many parts are gathered without a name, they become a chariot.\n――\"Gathered\" means brought together. When people bring together spokes, wheels, hubs, crossbars, and carriages, there is no name for them as a chariot—yet they are called a chariot. Thus, it is to enlighten the feudal lords and kings: they do not name themselves with exalted titles, yet they achieve their nobility.\n\nDo not desire brilliance like jade,\nnor coarseness like stone.\n――\"Brilliance\" signifies scarcity;\n\"coarseness\" signifies abundance.\nJade is scarce, hence its nobility;\nstone is abundant, hence its lowliness.\nMeaning, one should not desire to be like jade, prized by others,\nnor like stone, despised by others—\nrather, one should dwell in moderation.\n\n**Chapter Forty: The Way’s Movement is Return**\n――Returning to the origin. The origin is the Way by which all things are generated.\n――Generation gives rise to all things; abandoning it leads to their extinction.\nThe Way’s use is in the weak.\n――The Way habitually employs softness and weakness, hence its enduring power.\nAll things under heaven are born from the existent.\n――All things arise from Heaven and Earth, which have form and position—hence, \"born from the existent.\"\nThe existent is born from the nonexistent.\n――Heaven and Earth, subtle and luminous,\nwhere insects dart and worms wriggle—\nall these arise from the Way.\nThe Way is formless, hence \"born from the nonexistent.\"\nThis says the origin surpasses ornamentation,\nthe weak surpass the strong,\nand humility surpasses fullness.\n\n**Chapter Forty-One: The Way of Uniformity and Diversity**\nThe superior man, hearing the Way, strives to practice it.\n――The superior man, hearing the Way, exerts himself earnestly, as if straining all his strength to follow it.\nThe middle man, hearing the Way, holds it lightly, as if it might vanish.\n――The middle man, hearing the Way, applies it to self-cultivation for longevity,\nand to governance for lasting peace—\nhis joyful adherence may falter\nwhen tempted by wealth, desire, or honor,\nand he may then abandon it.\nThe inferior man, hearing the Way, laughs at it.\n――The inferior man, greedy and desiring much,\nsees the Way’s softness as terrifying,\nits plainness as vulgar—\nhence, he laughs at it.\nNot to laugh is not sufficient for the Way.\n――If the Way is not mocked by the inferior man, it cannot be named as the Way.\nThus, I set forth these paradoxes:\n――*Setting forth* means establishing.\nEstablishing words to illustrate the Way, as in the following:\n\nThe enlightened man appears as if in darkness.\n――The man who understands the Way seems as if he sees nothing.\nThe one who advances the Way appears as if retreating.\n――He who pursues the Way seems to fall behind.\nThe one who smooths the Way appears as if conforming to others.\n――*Smoothing* means making plain.\nThe man of great Way does not distinguish himself;\nhe follows the multitude.\nThe man of supreme virtue appears as if in a valley.\n――The man of supreme virtue does not scorn filth and humiliation,\nbut remains in the depths like a valley.\nGreat purity appears as if in shame.\n――The man of great purity does not flaunt his cleanliness,\nbut seems stained like one who has labored.\nAmple virtue appears as if insufficient.\n――The man of vast virtue seems as if lacking,\nnot boasting of his attainments.\nEstablishing virtue appears as if hollow.\n――The man who establishes virtue seems as if it could be stolen,\nhis integrity not fully realized.\nPlain truth appears as if tainted.\n――The plain and true man seems as if his colors have faded,\nhis meaning obscured.\nThe man of great harmony has no angles.\n――The man of perfect harmony has no crookedness or sharp edges.\nGreat vessels are fashioned late.\n――Great vessels, like the Nine Cauldrons and the jade stands,\ncannot be rushed to completion.\nGreat sound is rare in voice.\n――Great sound, like thunder waiting its moment,\nis often silent, its voice scarce.\nGreat image is formless.\n――The man of great law and image is plain and unadorned,\nhis essence without outward shape.\nThe Way is hidden and nameless.\n――The Way is subtle and concealed,\nso that men cannot point to it and name it.\n\nOnly the Way is good at lending,\nand it is certain to repay.\n――*Repay* means fulfill.\nThe Way lends its vital *qi* to all,\nand it is certain to bring them to fruition.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Two: The Way’s Transformation**\nThe Way gives birth to One.\n――The Way’s first generation is One.\nOne generates Two.\n――One generates Yin and Yang.\nTwo generates Three.\n――Yin and Yang generate harmonious *qi*;\nthe Way’s Three *qi* then divide into Heaven, Earth, and Man.\nThree generates the Ten Thousand Things.\n――Heaven and Earth together give birth to the Ten Thousand Things.\nHeaven bestows, Earth transforms,\nand Man nurtures them.\nAll things under heaven carry Yin within them\nand embrace Yang.\n――All things without fail lean toward Yin and seek Yang,\ntheir hearts returning to the sun.\nThe interplay of *qi* brings harmony.\n――Within all things, there is vital *qi*—\nwhen it is balanced and gentle,\nit is like a hidden bone within the chest,\nor marrow within the spine,\nor the void within plants—\nthis *qi* flows freely, hence their enduring life.\n\nWhat men detest is the \"Lonely and Bereft\" (孤寡不毂),\nyet kings and nobles take it as their name.\n――\"Lonely and Bereft\" (孤寡不毂) is an ominous title,\nyet kings and nobles adopt it—\nfor they dwell in the law of humility,\nemptiness, harmony, and gentleness.\nThus, some things may be diminished\nyet still grow stronger.\n――If one pulls, it must return;\nif one pushes, it must still revert.\nOr some things may be increased\nyet still grow weaker.\n――He who raises himself too high will crumble;\nhe who hoards wealth will invite disaster.\nThis is what men are taught.\n――The masses are taught to discard weakness for strength,\nand softness for rigidity.\nI too teach this—\nbut in reverse:\n――I teach men to discard strength for weakness,\nand rigidity for softness.\n\nThe strong and rigid will not meet their end.\n――The strong and rigid are those who do not trust in the mysterious,\nwho defy the Way and do not follow its teachings,\nbut rely on power and force.\nThey will not die a natural death—\nfor Heaven will cut them off,\nweapons will strike them down,\nand the law will execute them.\nI shall make this my first lesson.\n――*Lesson* means beginning.\nLaozi takes the strong and rigid as the starting point for teaching.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Three: Universal Application**\nThe softest thing under heaven\novercomes the hardest thing under heaven.\n――The softest is water;\nthe hardest is metal and stone.\nWater can penetrate hardness,\nenter rigidity—\nnothing it cannot pass through.\nIt has no gaps in its passage.\n――*It* refers to the Way.\nThe Way, being formless and without substance,\ncan enter and exit without obstruction,\npenetrating the spirit and sustaining all life.\nThus, I know the benefits of *wuwei*.\n――I see that the Way’s *wuwei* allows all things to transform naturally—\nhence, I know the benefits of *wuwei* for men.\n\nThe teaching that is not spoken.\n――The Way’s teaching is not given in words,\nbut through example.\nThe benefits of *wuwei*.\n――The Way’s teaching of *wuwei* brings benefit:\nto self-cultivation through spiritual refinement,\nto governance through blessing the people—\nwithout exertion or trouble.\n\n「Few in the world can attain it.\n――The ruler of the world.\nFew can achieve the Way’s *wuwei* in self-cultivation and governance.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Four: Establishing Precepts**\n*Which is closer to the body: fame or self?*\n――Fame flourishes, yet the body declines.\n*The body or wealth: which is more abundant?*\n――Wealth multiplies, yet it harms the body.\n*Gain or loss: which brings greater suffering?*\n――Clinging to profit brings suffering in conduct.\n*The more one loves, the greater the expenditure.*\n――Excessive love of color drains one’s spirit,\nexcessive love of wealth invites calamity.\nThe more one cherishes, the more one loses—\nthus, the greater the expenditure.\n*The more one hoards, the more one perishes.*\n――In life, wealth is stored in treasuries;\nin death, it is buried in graves.\nLiving brings the worry of *gongjie* (功劫, \"taxation and labor\"),\ndying brings the woes of tomb-digging and coffin-searching.\n\n**Knowing Contentment Prevents Humiliation**\n――A man who knows contentment cuts off profit and abandons desire,\nthus avoiding humiliation for his body.\n\n**Knowing to Stop Prevents Ruin**\n――Knowing when to stop means\nwealth and profit do not burden the body,\nsounds and colors do not disorder the ears and eyes—\nthen the body faces no peril or ruin.\n*Thus, one can endure long.*\n\n**Chapter Forty-Five: Profound Virtue/Power**\n*A great attainment seems incomplete.*\n――It refers to a ruler of great virtue/power (*Dao/De*),\nwhose attainment seems incomplete—\nhis name is extinguished,\nhis reputation concealed,\nas though destroyed and lacking nothingness.\nYet his use is without flaw.\n\n*A great abundance seems empty.*\n――It refers to a ruler of great virtue/power (*Dao/De*)\nfilled with abundance—\nlike emptiness, he does not dare to be arrogant in his nobility,\nnor extravagant in his wealth.\nThus, his use is inexhaustible.\n\n**The Way of Moderation Continues**\n――*Thus, his use of virtue/power is inexhaustible.*\n\n**Great Straightness as Flexibility**\n――*Great straightness* refers to one who follows the Dao/Way and its laws with unwavering rectitude.\n*As flexibility*, he does not contend with the common folk—\nhis rectitude bends like reeds in the wind.\n\n**Great Skill as Clumsiness**\n――*Great skill* means possessing many talents.\n*As clumsiness*, he does not dare display his abilities.\n\n**Great Eloquence as Speechlessness**\n――*Great eloquence* is wisdom without doubt.\n*As speechlessness*, his words are few—\nhis tongue is restrained, his speech measured.\n\n**Excessive Vitality Overcomes Cold**\n――*Excessive* means extreme.\nIn spring and summer, the yang-qi is vigorous above—\nwhen things flourish to their peak, cold follows,\nand cold brings withering and death.\nThus, one must not be overly rigid and harsh.\n\n**Stillness Overcomes Heat**\n――In autumn and winter, all things rest beneath the earth—\nwhen stillness reaches its extreme, heat arises,\nfor heat is the source of life.\n*Clarity and stillness are the eternal order of the world.*\n\n**Chapter Forty-Six: Frugality as Desire**\n*The world follows the Dao.*\n――It refers to a ruler who embodies the Dao.\n*He turns back the warhorses to till the fields.*\n――*Turning back* means using them to fertilize the land.\nA ruler who governs his body turns back his yang-qi\nto nourish his essence.\n\n*The world does not

indulging desire.*\n――Excessive lust is the root.\n*No greater calamity than not knowing contentment.*\n――Wealth and honor cannot restrain him.\n*No greater fault than greed.*\n――Greed for people and gain is insatiable.\n*Thus, true contentment is rooted in authenticity.*\n――Preserving the true essence.\n*Ever-contented.*\n――Free from desire.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Seven: Discernment from Afar**\n*Without leaving home, one knows the world.*\n――The Sage, without stepping outside,\nknows the world by knowing himself—\nby knowing his own body, he knows others’,\nby knowing his own family, he knows others’ families.\nThus, he perceives the world.\n\n*Without peering through the window, one sees the Dao of Heaven.*\n――The Dao of Heaven aligns with human conduct—\nthe great harmonize, their vital essences interconnected.\nWhen a ruler is pure, the heavenly qi aligns naturally.\nWhen a ruler is desirous, the heavenly qi grows turbulent.\nAll fortune, calamity, benefit, and harm arise from within.\n\n*The farther one goes, the less one knows.*\n――Moving from one’s home to observe others’ families,\nfrom one’s body to observe others’ bodies—\nthe farther one looks, the less one truly sees.\n\n*Thus, the Sage knows without traveling.*\n――The Sage neither ascends to heaven nor descends to the abyss,\nyet knows the heavens and earth through the mind.\n*He names without seeing.*\n――When the ruler above values the Dao,\nand those below value virtue,\nwhen the ruler above values martial might,\nand those below value strength—\nthe Sage roots small knowledge in great,\ndiscerns the inner to know the outer.\n*He achieves without action.*\n――When the ruler above does nothing,\nthe people below have no burdens—\nfamilies are well-provided, people are at ease,\nand all things transform naturally.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Eight: Forgetting Knowledge**\n*Learning increases daily.*\n――*Learning* refers to governance, rites, music, and instruction.\n*Daily increase* means desires and adornments grow ever more.\n\n*The Dao diminishes daily.*\n――*The Dao* refers to the natural Way.\n*Daily diminishment* means desires and adornments are gradually stripped away.\n\n*Diminish again, and again.*\n――Strip away desires once more,\nuntil one attains *wuwei*—\n*Simple and unadorned, like an infant,*\ndoing nothing yet accomplishing all.\n\n*Without action, nothing remains undone.*\n――When desires are severed,\nvirtue and the Dao unite—\nnothing is beyond reach, nothing beyond attainment.\n\n*Taking the world is ever through non-action.*\n――*Taking* means governing.\nTo govern the world, one must act with *wuwei*—\nnot through labor, but through ease.\n\n*When action arises, it is insufficient to take the world.*\n――When one favors action,\ngovernance becomes burdensome, the people restless—\nthus, it is inadequate to rule the world.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Nine: Trusting in Virtue**\n*The Sage has no fixed mind.*\n――The Sage values transformation, adapts to circumstances,\nas if his mind were ever-empty.\n\n*He takes the people’s mind as his own.*\n――He follows what benefits the people.\n\n*If they are good, I reward their goodness.*\n――When the people act virtuously, the Sage reinforces it.\n\n*If they are not good, I still reward goodness.*\n――Even if the people act poorly, the Sage transforms them toward virtue.\n*Thus, virtue becomes goodness.*\n\n*If they are trustworthy, I trust them.*\n――When the people are honest, the Sage affirms it.\n\n*If they are untrustworthy, I still trust them.*\n――When the people are deceitful, the Sage transforms them toward honesty.\n*Thus, virtue becomes trust.*\n\n*The Sage in the world is ever cautious.*\n――The Sage in the world is always vigilant,\nfearing arrogance and excess in wealth and honor.\n\n*He muddles the people’s minds.*\n――He clouds their perceptions,\nas if they were dim-witted and unknowing.\n\n*The people rely on him for sight and hearing.*\n――*Rely* means to use.\nThe people depend on the Sage for perception and judgment.\n\n*The Sage nurtures them like infants.*\n――The Sage cherishes the people as infants—\nnourishing them without expectation of return.\n\n**Chapter Fifty: Valuing Life**\n*Birth and death.*\n――*Birth* is when desires emerge—\nthe spirit and soul are undisturbed, the vital essence settled.\n*Death* is when desires enter the chest—\nthe spirit is exhausted, the mind confused.\n\n*Those who live by vitality number thirteen,*\n*those who die by vitality number thirteen.*\n――The types of life and death each have thirteen—\nthe nine orifices and four passages.\n\n*In life, the eyes do not gaze wantonly,*\n*the ears do not listen recklessly,*\n*the nose does not indulge scent,*\n*the mouth does not speak idly,*\n*the hands do not grasp greedily,*\n*the feet do not walk recklessly,*\n*the spirit does not act recklessly—*\n*thus, death comes when these are violated.*\n\n*Man’s actions lead him to death’s ground thirteen times.*\n――Man’s pursuit of life, through reckless action, leads to thirteen deaths.\n\n*Why is this so?*\n――*Why* does action lead to death’s ground?\n\nWith its abundance of life-giving vitality—\n---\nThe reason one falls into death’s ground\nis that their pursuit of life is excessive,\ncontrary to the Dao, defying Heaven,\nacting recklessly, and losing proper measure.\n\nIt is said that those who nurture life well—\n*Screens* (nurture) life:\nWhen walking on land, they avoid rhinoceros and tigers—\nnaturally keeping harm at bay, not provoking it.\nEntering battle, they avoid weapons—\nthey do not delight in war or take lives.\nThe rhinoceros has no place to thrust its horns,\nthe tiger no place to strike with its claws,\nthe weapons no place to find their edge—\nfor those who nurture life, beasts and blades dare not harm them.\n*Why is this so?*\n---\n*Why* do tigers, rhinoceros, and weapons not harm them?\nBecause they do not tread upon the thirteen death grounds—\ntheir spirit and vitality are protected by the numinous,\nand such things dare not harm them.\n\n**Chapter 51: Nurturing Virtue**\nThe Dao gives birth.\nVirtue nourishes.\nThe One distributes *qi* and nurtures.\nIt shapes the forms of things.\nIt establishes their nature.\nThus, all things do not fail to revere the Dao and honor virtue.\nThe Dao’s reverence, virtue’s nobility—\nnone command them, yet they act naturally.\nThus, the Dao gives birth, virtue nurtures,\nlengthens, matures, completes, and shelters.\nWho would not nourish and protect?\nIt does not claim what it gives birth to.\nIt acts without relying on reward.\nIt lengthens without domination.\nThis is called the Mysterious Virtue.\n\n**Chapter 52: Returning to the Origin**\nThe world has a beginning—\nthe Dao, which is its mother.\nHaving known its mother, one must know its child—\nthe One.\nHaving known its child, one must return to its mother—\nthe Dao—\nand practice non-action.\nThus, one’s life is without peril.\nClose the *dui* (eyes)—\ndo not gaze wantonly.\nShut the gate (mouth)—\ndo not speak recklessly.\nThus, one’s life is without toil.\nOpen the *dui*—\nindulge desires.\nBenefit desire’s affairs—\nthus, one’s life is without salvation.\nSeeing what is small is called insight—\nwhen mischief first stirs, one perceives it clearly.\nGuarding softness is called strength—\nto persist in weakness is to grow mighty.\nUse its light—\ndirect your vision outward to discern the world’s advantages and harms.\nThen return to its insight—\ndo not let your spirit scatter.\nThus, your body will suffer no ruin.\nThis is called habitual practice.\n\n**Chapter 53: Augmenting Proof**\nLet me stand firm in knowing\nand walk the Great Dao—\n*Great* (intense).\nLaozi laments that rulers of his time do not follow the Great Dao,\nso he speaks thus:\nLet me stand firm in knowing governance,\nthen practice the Dao’s effortless transformation.\nOnly fear what you do—\n*Only*, for fear of acting contrary to the Dao,\nfearing that rewarding goodness will breed false virtue,\nfearing that trusting loyalty will summon deceit.\nThe Great Dao is most level—\nyet the people prefer crooked paths.\nWhen the court is grand and palaces adorned,\nfields lie fallow—\nagriculture neglected, uncultivated.\nGranaries are empty—\nharvests ruined, the state without reserves.\nGarments are embroidered with fine silks—\nluxurious adornment, inner splendor.\nThey wear sharp swords—\nvaluing strength, arms, and extravagance.\nGluttony for food and drink, wealth in excess—\nthis is called banditry’s vanity.\nThe people grow rich, yet the ruler has more—\nthis comes from plunder, leading to ruined lives,\nbroken homes, and scattered kin.\nThis is not the Dao.\n\nThe words *\"复言也哉\"* are words of sorrowful lament.\n**Chapter 54: *Shàn Jiàn***—*\"The Well-Established Cannot Be Uprooted\"*—\nEstablishment.\nThose who establish themselves and their nation in the Dao cannot be uprooted or drawn away.\nThose who embrace the Dao with sincerity cannot be separated or released.\nTheir descendants will never cease in sacrifice—\nFor those who cultivate the Dao thus attain immortality, generation after generation, perpetually honoring their ancestors in the ancestral temple without end.\nCultivated in the self, its virtue becomes true.\nCultivated in the family, its virtue overflows.\nCultivated in the village, its virtue endures.\nCultivated in the state, its virtue flourishes.\nCultivated in the world, its virtue is universal.\n\nThus, observe the self with the self—\nCompare the Dao-cultivated with the uncultivated, and see which perishes, which endures.\nObserve the family with the family—\nCompare the Dao-cultivated household with the uncultivated.\nObserve the village with the village—\nCompare the Dao-cultivated village with the uncultivated.\nObserve the state with the state—\nCompare the Dao-cultivated realm with the uncultivated.\nObserve the world with the world—\nCompare the Dao-cultivated sovereign with the uncultivated.\nHow do I know this of the world? By this.\n\n**Chapter 55: *Xuán Fú* — *\"The Mysterious Omen\"*\nThe depth of virtue embraced—\nLike the infant.\nDivine protection enfolds those who harbor virtue,\nAs parents cherish an infant.\nPoisonous creatures do not sting—\nBees, wasps, serpents, and scorpions do not harm.\nFierce beasts do not seize, predatory birds do not strike.\nIts bones are frail, its sinews soft, yet its grasp is firm—\nThe infant’s sinews and bones are weak, yet it holds fast because its will is unshaken.\nIt knows not the union of male and female, yet its vitality surges—\nThe infant, unaware of copulation, yet its *jing* overflows.\nIt weeps all day without hoarseness—\nIts voice remains unbroken from dawn to dusk, for its *qi* is harmonious.\nTo know harmony is to know constancy—\nHe who understands the gentle strength of *qi* has grasped the Dao’s essence.\nTo know constancy is to know clarity—\nHe who walks the Dao’s constancy attains enlightenment.\nLife grows auspicious daily—\n*Xiáng* means \"long-lasting\"—speaking of life extending and growing strong.\nThe heart directs *qi* to grow ever stronger—\nWhen the mind is focused and harmonious, *qi* solidifies within, yet if the will wanders, the harmonious *qi* dissipates, and the body grows rigid.\nWhen things reach their peak, they wither—\nThis is called *not the Dao*.\nNot the Dao brings early decay—\nThose who do not align with the Dao perish young.\n\n**Chapter 56: *Xuán Dé* — *\"The Mysterious Virtue\"**\nThe wise do not speak—\nWisdom lies in action, not words.\nThose who speak do not know—\nA chariot cannot overtake the tongue; many words bring many calamities.\nSeal the pass, close the gate—\nBlock the source to cut off excess.\nDull the sharp—\nWhen desires sharpen, recall the Dao’s non-action to blunt them.\nDissolve the wrath—\nWhen resentment festers, recall the Dao’s non-action to dissolve it.\nDull the brilliance—\nThough one’s insight may shine, harmonize it so it does not dazzle or disrupt.\nBlend with the dust—\nDo not set yourself apart.\nThis is called *Mysterious Unity*—\n*Xuán*, the Heavenly. He who acts in the highest way aligns with Heaven’s Dao.\n\nThus, he cannot be drawn near—\nHe does not take pride in honor nor sorrow in solitude.\nNor can he be pushed away—\nHis mind at rest, he bears no grudges against others.\nHe cannot be exploited—\nHe does not covet wealth nor indulge in sensual pleasures.\nNor can he be harmed—\nHe does not contend with the greedy for gain, nor with the bold for strength.\nHe cannot be exalted—\nHe does not serve chaotic rulers nor occupy positions under tyrannical lords.\nNor can he be debased—\nHe does not grow arrogant through power nor bend through lost resolve.\nThus, he is noble beyond the world.\n\n**Chapter 57: *Chún Fēng* — *\"The Pure Wind\"**\nGovern the state with rectitude—\n\nThe Celestial One empowers those who uphold rectitude to rule a realm.\nHe employs deception in warfare—\n*Qi*, the artful. The Celestial One entrusts the artful with command of arms.\n\nHe seizes the world through non-action.\n—He appoints as sovereign those who act with effortless ease and do-nothingness.\n\nHow do I know this to be true?\nThrough this:\n—*This*, the present. Laozi asks, \"How do I know Heaven’s intent to be thus?\"\nI perceive it from what I see today.\n\nThe world abounds in prohibitions,\nYet the people grow ever poorer.\n—The world refers to rulers. Prohibitions mean restrictions and bans.\nWhen commands multiply, deceit flourishes below;\nWhen bans increase, the common folk vie in cunning,\nAnd thus poverty ensues.\n\nThe people wield many sharp implements,\nThe state grows ever more chaotic.\n—Sharp implements are *power*.\nWhen the people hold much *power*,\nThose who see are dazzled by excess,\nThose who hear are bewildered by noise,\nAnd thus the state descends into disorder.\n\nThe people cultivate many clever arts,\nStrange objects proliferate—\n—The people refer to the sovereign and the feudal lords within a hundred *li*.\nTo know many clever arts means to carve and paint palaces,\nTo engrave and embroider garments and adornments,\nAnd strange objects multiply below.\nThen the lower classes emulate the upper,\nAnd the adornment of gold, silver filigree,\nAnd embroidered colors grows ever more extravagant.\n\nWhen fine goods abound,\nThieves and robbers multiply.\n—*Fine goods*, desirable objects.\n\nThe treasures and delicacies multiply and become conspicuous,\nThen agricultural labor is neglected,\nHunger and cold come together,\nAnd thus thieves and robbers abound.\n\nTherefore, the Sage says:\n—Referring to the governance of the common folk.\n*\"I do no action, yet the people transform themselves,\"*\n—The Sage means that I cultivate the Dao and align with Heaven,\nMaking no alterations or creations,\nYet the people naturally transform and perfect themselves.\n\n*\"I love quietude, yet the people become upright,\"*\n—The Sage means that I love stillness and do not speak,\nYet all the people become naturally loyal and virtuous.\n\n*\"I do no labor, yet the people grow wealthy,\"*\n—If I do not impose corvée or conscription,\nThe people settle into their occupations,\nAnd thus all become wealthy.\n\n*\"I have no desires, yet the people remain simple.\"*\n—If I always refrain from desires,\nRemoving ornate words and sumptuous attire,\nAnd do not adorn the people,\nThen they follow me in simplicity and naturalness.\n\n**Chapter 58: Harmonizing Transformation**\nHis governance is *obscure and tranquil*,\n—His governance is broad and lenient,\n*Obscure and tranquil*, as if unclear.\nHis people are *pure and sincere*,\n—Because his governance is broad and lenient,\nThe people are pure and sincere,\nRich and abundant, harmonious and kind.\n\nHis governance is *sharp and vigilant*,\n—His governance is swift and urgent,\nDecisions made by word and ear alone.\nHis people are *depleted and frail*.\n—If governance is urgent, the people cannot sustain life,\nThus depletion and frailness grow ever more pronounced.\n\nDisaster! *It leans upon fortune.*\n—*Lean*, as in *depends*.\nDisaster arises from fortune;\nWhen Heaven meets disaster yet can repent,\nTake responsibility, and cultivate virtue,\nThen the Dao of proper conduct,\nDisaster departs and fortune arrives.\n\nFortune! *It harbors disaster.*\n—Disaster lies concealed within fortune;\nIf one receives fortune yet becomes arrogant and licentious,\nThen fortune departs and disaster comes.\n\nWho knows its limit?\n—Disaster and fortune alternate in generation,\nWho can know when their extremes will come?\n\nIf the ruler lacks rectitude,\n—*Lack*, as in *not*.\nIt means the ruler does not rectify himself,\nThen there will be no state.\n\nRectitude becomes deceitful,\n—*Deceitful*, as in *artifice*.\nThough the ruler is upright,\nIf his subjects are upright,\nHe will still transform into deceitful artifice above.\n\nVirtue becomes ominous,\n—Virtuous men will also transform into ominous portents above.\nThe people’s confusion is longstanding indeed,\n—It means that the ruler’s bewilderment and loss of rectitude\nHave already endured for some time.\n\nThus the Sage acts with *squareness* yet does not sever,\n—The Sage practices *squareness* and rectitude,\nDesiring to guide the people,\nNot to cut or harm them.\n\nIs *frugal* yet does not injure,\n—The Sage is frugal and clear,\nDesiring to transform the people,\nNot to harm them.\nNow it is not so: rectitude harms the people.\n\nIs *straight* yet does not impose,\n—*Impose*, as in *assert*.\nThough the Sage is straight,\nHe bends himself to follow others,\nNot asserting his own will.\n\nIs *bright* yet does not dazzle*.\n—The Sage, though possessing singular insight,\nAlways appears as if in darkness,\nNot dazzling others with brilliance.\n\n**Chapter 59: Guarding the Dao**\nGovern the people,\n—The ruler desires to govern the people.\nServe Heaven,\n—*Serve*, as in *employ*.\nHe must employ the Dao of Heaven,\nAligning with the four seasons.\nNothing is better than *frugality*,\n—*Frugality*, as in *greed*.\nThe ruler must love the people,\nThen he will not be extravagant or oppressive.\nThe individual must love his *qi* and essence,\nNot indulging in dissipation.\n\nOnly through *frugality*\nCan one be said to *earn early*.\n—*Early*, as in *first*.\n*Earn*, as in *obtain*.\nOnly through loving the people’s resources\nAnd cherishing his *qi* and essence\nCan one first obtain the Dao of Heaven.\n\nTo *earn early* is called *accumulating virtue*.\n—First obtaining the Dao of Heaven\nIs called accumulating virtue within oneself.\nAccumulating virtue ensures no defeat,\n—*Defeat*, as in *overcome*.\nAccumulating virtue within oneself\nEnsures no one can overcome him.\nIf no one can overcome him,\nThen none know his limits.\n—If no one can overcome or defeat him,\nThen none can know the extent of his virtue.\nNone knowing his limits,\nHe can have a state.\n—None knowing the limits of his virtue,\nHe can possess land and people,\nBringing lasting fortune to the common folk.\nA state’s foundation,\nCan endure forever.\n—The state and the body are the same.\n*Foundation*, as in *Dao*.\nIf one can preserve the Dao within his body,\nHis *qi* and essence unexhausted,\nHis five senses unstrained,\nThen he can endure forever.\nThis is called *deep-rooted and firm-based*,\n—If one can take *qi* as root and essence as base,\nLike a tree whose roots are not deep,\nThen its branches and base are not firm,\nAnd it will fall.\nIt is said that one should deeply conceal his *qi*,\nFirmly guard his essence,\nPreventing any leakage.\n\nThe Dao of *long life and enduring vision*.\n—Deep-rooted and firm-based\nIs the Dao of long life and enduring vision.\n\n**Chapter 60: Occupying a Position**\nTo govern a great state is like cooking a small fish.\n—*Fish*, as in *delicate*.\nCooking a small fish,\nOne does not remove its entrails,\nDoes not scrape its scales,\nDoes not dare to disturb it,\nFor fear it will spoil.\nIf governance is troublesome,\nThe common folk will rebel below;\nIf self-cultivation is troublesome,\nThe *qi* and essence will scatter.\n\nWith the Dao governing the world,\nIts spirits are not *numinous*.\n—With virtue and the Dao in position,\nThe spirits dare not manifest their *numinous* power\nTo harm the people.\n\nNot that its spirits lack *numinous* power,\nBut that their *numinous* power does not harm people.\n—The spirits are not without *numinous* power;\nOnly through failing to uphold the *Eight Virtues*\nCan one harm the natural disposition of others.\nNot that their *numinous* power cannot harm people,\nThe Sage also does not harm.\n—Only spirits and *numinous* power can harm people;\nSince the Sage in position does not harm people,\nThe spirits dare not interfere.\n\nThus the two do not harm each other,\n—The spirits and the Sage both\nDo not harm each other.\nHence virtue returns and converges.\n\n**Chapter 61: Humble Virtue**\nA great state is like a *low-lying stream*,\n—In governing a great state,\nOne should be like a stream in low-lying places,\nNot opposing the minutiae.\n\nThe gathering of the world,\n—The great state is where the world’s scholars and common folk\nConverge and interact.\n\nThe *yin* of the world.\n—*Yin*, as in *female*.\nSoft, humble, and yielding,\nYet not boastful.\n*Yin* always overcomes *yang* through stillness,\n—The female overcomes the male,\nAs *yin* overcomes *yang* through tranquility,\nAnd fulfillment without seeking first.\n\nWith stillness as the *low-lying*.\n—The Dao of *yin* is humble through stillness.\nThus a great state subjugates small states,\nAnd takes them.\n\n「――If one can be humble and lowly,\nThen one will always possess it.\nThe small state, if humble before the great state,\nWill take the great state.\n—This says that a state, whether large or small,\nIf it holds to humility and nurtures the people,\nWill have no faults.\n\nThus, sometimes one is humble to take,\nSometimes one is humble and takes.\n—*Humble* here means the great state being humble before the small state,\nAnd the small state being humble before the great state,\nExchanging them through righteousness.\n\nThe great state does not seek to annex and nurture others,\n—The great state should not lose what it has,\nBut rather absorb and tend to other states.\nThe small state does not seek to serve others,\n—To make them into subjects and servants.\n\nBoth sides thus obtain what they desire,\nAnd the greater should act humbly.\n—The great state and the small state each desire what they seek,\nAnd the great state should also practice humility.\n\n**Chapter 62: The Way**\nThe Way is the hidden essence of all things.\n—*Essence*, meaning *hidden*.\nThe Way is the hidden treasure of all things,\nAnd contains all without exception.\n\nThe treasure of the virtuous,\n—The virtuous take the Way as their personal treasure,\nAnd dare not defy it.\nThe refuge of the unvirtuous.\n—The Way is also the refuge of the unvirtuous.\nWhen disaster strikes or urgency arises,\nThey still know to repent, humble themselves, and submit.\n\nBeautiful words can be sold,\n—*Beautiful words* are only useful in the marketplace,\nFor in trade, once the exchange is done,\nThe parties part ways—no further harmony remains.\nGood words and fine speech,\nThe seeker wants to acquire them quickly,\nThe seller wants to sell them quickly.\n\nNoble conduct can be bestowed upon others.\n—*Bestow*, meaning *distinguish*.\nA person with noble conduct can surpass the common man,\nYet this is still insufficient to honor the Way.\n\nWhat should be done with those who are unvirtuous?\n—Though unvirtuous, they should be transformed by the Way.\nBefore the Three Sovereigns,\nThere were no abandoned people—\nTheir virtue was pure and their teachings refined.\n\nThus, the Son of Heaven is established,\nAnd the Three Ministers appointed,\n—To teach and transform the unvirtuous.\n\nEven with a jade tablet and four horses leading the way,\nIt is not as good as sitting and embracing this Way.\n—Though one arrives with a precious jade tablet\nAnd fine horses ahead,\nIt is still not as good as sitting and embracing this Way.\n\nWhy did the ancients value this Way so highly?\nNot because they sought it and obtained it daily,\n—The ancients valued this Way\nNot by daily searching for it externally,\nBut by attaining it within themselves.\n\nOr to atone for guilt?\n—*Guilt* refers to those in chaotic times\nUnder tyrannical rulers who met with unjust punishment.\nPracticing the Way can absolve death\nAnd spare them from the masses.\n\nThus, it is held in highest regard.\n\n**Chapter 63: The Beginning of Favor**\nTo act without acting,\n—To follow what is already formed,\nAnd thus make no artificial constructions.\nTo manage without managing,\n—To prepare in advance,\nAnd thus eliminate troublesome affairs.\nTo taste without tasting.\n—To think deeply and plan far ahead,\nAnd thus savor the Way’s meaning.\n\nGreat or small, much or little,\n—To set forth warnings and orders.\nTo desire greatness is to return to smallness,\nTo desire much is to return to little,\nThe natural course of things.\n\nTo repay resentment with virtue.\n—To practice the Way and do good,\nAnd thus prevent disaster before it arises.\n\nTo plan for difficulty when it is easy,\n—To plan for great challenges\nWhen they are still in their early, unformed stages.\nTo build the great from the small.\n—To undertake great matters,\nOne must begin with small ones—\nFor calamities arise from small beginnings.\n\nThe most difficult things in the world\nMust be addressed when they are easy.\nThe greatest things in the world\nMust be addressed when they are small.\n\nThus, the Sage never pursues the great.\n—By remaining humble and modest,\nHe can achieve the greatest.\n\nAnd so he attains the great.\n—The world unites under him.\n\nHe who makes light of promises will be lacking in trustworthiness,\n—He does not take his words seriously.\nHe who takes on too much will encounter many difficulties,\n—He does not guard against misfortune.\n\nThus, the Sage treats even these matters with caution,\n—The Sage, in all his actions and undertakings,\nWeighs them carefully, advancing and retreating with difficulty,\nTo block their origins.\n\nAnd so he never encounters difficulty.\n—The Sage, throughout his life,\nAvoids misfortune as one avoids deep harm.\n\n**Chapter 64: Guarding the Subtle**\nIts ease lies in its stability,\n—To govern oneself and the state,\nThe stable is easy to uphold.\nIts unmanifested state is easy to plan for,\n—When desires and disasters\nHave not yet taken form,\nThey are easy to correct in advance.\nIts fragility is easy to break,\n—When calamities have not yet stirred in court\nAnd desires have not yet shown on the face,\nThey are as fragile as glass and easy to dispel.\nIts subtlety is easy to disperse.\n—When it is not yet manifest,\nIts subtlety is easy to eliminate.\n\nTo act before it exists,\n—To undertake anything,\nOne must do so before its roots take hold.\nTo govern before it is disordered.\n—To govern oneself and the state,\nOne must act before disorder arises,\nAnd preemptively close the door.\n\nA tree as thick as one’s embrace\nGrows from a tiny sprout,\n—A thing grows from small to great.\nA nine-tiered tower\nRises from a pile of soil.\n—A thing ascends from low to high.\nA thousand-li journey\nBegins beneath one’s feet.\n—A thing extends from near to far.\n\nTo act is to court ruin,\n—Artificial action ruins naturalness.\nTo grasp is to lose.\n—To cling to gain invites misfortune;\nTo cling to the Way preserves the body,\nYet if one refuses to yield or return,\nOne loses.\n\nThe Sage acts without acting,\nAnd thus meets with no ruin,\n—The Sage does not indulge in empty words,\nNor in material gain or violence,\nAnd so suffers no destruction.\nHe does not grasp,\nAnd thus loses nothing.\n—The Sage, with virtue, teaches the foolish,\nAnd with wealth, aids the poor,\nHolding nothing back,\nAnd thus loses nothing to others.\n\nThe people, in their undertakings,\nOften ruin what is nearly complete.\n—*From*, meaning *to do*.\nThe people, in their affairs,\nOften, when success is nearly achieved,\nGrow greedy for position, fame, extravagance, and excess,\nAnd thus ruin themselves.\n\nTo be as careful at the end as at the beginning,\nThen there will be no ruined affairs.\n—The end must be as diligent as the beginning,\nLest one grow negligent.\n\nThus, the Sage desires what others do not desire,\n—The Sage desires what others do not,\nAnd what others make manifest,\nThe Sage conceals.\nWhat others adorn,\nThe Sage keeps plain.\nWhat others value in appearance,\nThe Sage values in virtue.\n\nHe does not prize difficult-to-obtain goods,\n—The Sage is not dazzled by fine clothing,\nNor does he devalue stone while prizing jade.\n\n「学不学，――The Sage learns what others cannot learn.\nOthers learn cleverness and deceit,\nThe Sage learns spontaneity.\nOthers learn to govern the world,\nThe Sage learns to govern himself and preserve the Dao, for truth lies therein.\nHe repeats the errors of the multitude.\n――The multitude learns wisdom, yet reverses its purpose—\nWhat should be the root becomes the superficial,\nAnd what should be the superficial becomes the root.\nThus, they are taught to return to the original,\n――To aid the natural course of all things—\nTheir true intent is to restore humanity’s innate nature.\nYet they dare not act.\n――The Sage acts with moderation, never daring to contrive,\nLest he stray from the root.\n\n**Chapter 65: Pure Virtue**\nThose of old who excelled in the Dao,\n――Those who governed well in ancient times,\nDid not seek to enlighten the people,\n――Not by teaching them cleverness or deceit.\nBut to deceive them.\n――To guide them with virtue, making them simple and unpretentious.\nThe difficulty in governing the people lies in their excess of cleverness.\n――Their cleverness leads to cunning and guile.\nTo govern with cleverness is to be the thief of the state.\n――To entrust statecraft to those skilled in cleverness\nIs to distance oneself from virtue and arrogantly wield power,\nThus becoming the thief of the state.\nTo govern without cleverness is to bring fortune to the state.\n――To keep statecraft from the clever and allow the people to uphold righteousness,\nWithout resorting to deceit or tyranny,\nIs for the ruler and subjects to be harmonious and united in strength—\nThus bringing fortune to the state.\nUnderstanding these two principles is the standard.\n――The two principles: governing with cleverness brings ruin,\nWhile governing without it brings fortune—\nThis is the model for self-cultivation and statecraft.\nTo always know this standard is called **Pure Virtue**.\n――*Pure*, meaning *heavenly*—\nTo know the principles of self-cultivation and statecraft\nIs to align oneself with heaven’s virtue.\nPure Virtue is profound and distant,\n――Its depths cannot be measured, its heights cannot be fathomed.\nIt opposes the ways of others,\n――For while others seek to benefit themselves,\nPure Virtue bestows upon all—\nAnd thus attains **Great Harmony**.\n――Pure Virtue opposes the ways of others,\nYet in doing so, it fulfills the natural order of heaven.\n\n**Chapter 66: Benevolence After Oneself**\nThe rivers and seas become kings of all valleys\nBecause they excel in yielding.\n――Because they are lowly, all streams flow to them,\nJust as the people follow the worthy.\nThus they become kings of all valleys.\n――Because they are humble and yielding,\nThey excel as kings of all valleys.\nTherefore, the Sage who wishes to be above the people,\n――Who desires to lead the people,\nMust speak from a position of humility.\n――Following the rivers and seas’ example of modesty.\nWho wishes to go before the people,\n――Who desires to take the lead,\nMust place himself behind them.\n――Putting others first and himself last.\nThus, though the Sage is above the people,\nThey do not feel burdened,\n――For he does not assert his noble status,\nBut humbles himself, so the people revere him without heaviness.\nAnd though he goes before them,\nThey are not harmed,\n――For he does not blind them with his brilliance,\nBut treats them with warmth, as if he harbored no ill intent.\nThus the whole world gladly follows him without weariness.\n――For his benevolence is deep, his love vast,\nAnd he regards the people as his own children—\nThus the world willingly follows him without tiring.\nBecause he does not contend,\n――For he does not vie with others for precedence,\nThus none under heaven can contend with him.\n――Others seek to act, but he does not,\nSo none can act against him.\n\n**Chapter 67: The Three Treasures**\nThe world says I am great, yet I seem unworthy.\n――The Daoist says the world calls him virtuous,\nYet he feigns foolishness, appearing unworthy.\nOnly because he is truly great does he seem unworthy.\n――For only the truly great\nHarm themselves by feigning foolishness,\nDistinguishing nothing, taking no credit—\nNot demeaning others but ennobling themselves.\nIf he were truly worthy for long,\n――*Worthy*, meaning *clever*—\nIt would mean he was merely a clever man,\nNot a great one.\nI possess three treasures; I hold them as treasures.\n――The Daoist says: I have three treasures, which I cherish.\nFirst, **compassion**,\n――Loving the people as one’s own children.\nSecond, **frugality**,\n――Taxing them lightly, as if taking from oneself.\nThird, **not daring to be first under heaven**,\n――Practicing humility, never leading by force.\nThrough compassion, he gains courage,\n――For compassion fosters loyalty and filial piety,\nThus enabling victory in battle.\nThrough frugality, he gains abundance,\n――For the ruler’s restraint allows the people’s daily needs to flourish.\nBy not daring to be first under heaven,\n――For he does not forcefully take the lead,\nThus he attains **Great Harmony and longevity**.\n――He becomes the leader of those who follow the Dao.\nNow, abandoning compassion and seeking only courage,\n――Now, the world abandons compassion for mere bravado,\nAbandoning frugality for extravagance,\n――Discarding restraint for luxury and excess,\nAbandoning humility and always striving to be first—\nThis is the path to death.\n――Such actions lead to ruin.\nCompassion, when wielded in war, brings victory,\n――For compassion unites the people’s hearts,\nThus ensuring triumph in battle and steadfastness in defense.\nWhen heaven would save them, it shields them with compassion.\n――For heaven aids those who possess compassion,\nGranting them the strength to defend themselves.\n\n**Chapter 68: Aligning with Heaven**\nThe skilled warrior does not rely on force,\n――For he values virtue over arms.\nThe adept at battle does not grow angry,\n――For he who fights with the Dao\nStops evil in its inception,\nPrevents disaster before it arises,\nAnd does not slay with wrath.\nThe master of victory does not contend,\n――For he who overcomes with the Dao\nDraws near with benevolence,\nRepels with virtue,\nAnd does not fight his enemy—\nThus the enemy submits of its own accord.»\n\n「善用人者為下。\n――善用人者自辅佐者常為人执謙下也。\n是謂不爭之德，\n――謂上為之下也。\n是乃不與人爭之道德也。\n是謂用人之力，\n――能身為人下是謂用人臣之力。\n是謂配天\n――能行此者德配天也。\n古之極。\n――是乃古之極要道也。\n\n**Chapter 69: Mysterious Application**\nThe adept at using others places himself beneath them.\n――For he who excels in using others\nis ever humble, assuming the role of servant.\nThis is called the virtue of non-contention,\n――For the high place themselves beneath the low.\nThis is the Dao of not contending with others.\nThis is called the strength of using others,\n――For he who can humble himself beneath others\nis the true strength of a subject.\nThis is called aligning with Heaven—\n――He who practices this\nhas virtue that matches Heaven.\nThe ultimate of antiquity.\n――This is the essential Dao of the ancients.\n\n**Chapter 70: Knowing the Unknown**\nTo know that one does not know is superior,\n――For the Daoist knows what he does not know.\nTo not know that one does not know is a sickness.\n――For he who does not know what he does not know\nsuffers from a moral sickness.\nOnly he who knows sickness can avoid it,\n――Thus he does not fall into sickness.\nThe sage does not suffer from sickness,\nfor he knows sickness.\n――For the sage has no arrogance of knowledge,\nbut he who knows sickness\nis one who endures the suffering of others\nwith their sickness of knowledge.\nThus he does not fall into sickness himself.\n――By comparison to others.\nTherefore, the sage does not suffer.\nFor the sage holds comprehensive knowledge,\nyet presents himself as one who does not know,\nto make the world simple and honest,\neach guarding their pure nature.\nThe petty man, lacking this knowledge,\nacts presumptuously, contending in his arrogance,\nthus harming his spirit and shortening his life.\n\n**Chapter 72: Loving Oneself**\nWhen the people do not fear great harm,\nthen great harm has truly arrived.\n――For harm is harm.\nIf they do not fear lesser harms,\nthen greater harms will come—\nspeaking of death.\nThose who fear it should cherish their spirit,\nupholding Heaven and conforming to Earth.\nDo not narrow their dwelling,\n――For the spirit resides in the heart,\nand the heart should be broad and gentle,\nnot hurried or confined.\nDo not weary their source of life.\n――That which sustains life is the spirit,\nrooted in emptiness and delighting in purity.\nExcessive indulgence in food,\nforgetting the Dao,\npursuing carnal pleasures,\nfilling the belly with impurities—\nthis is to harm their essence,\nto weary the spirit.\nOnly he who does not weary the spirit\ncan truly avoid wearying it.\n――For only he who does not weary his spirit\ncan wash his heart and purify his flaws,\nremaining tranquil and desireless,\nthus the spirit abides within him without weariness.\nTherefore, the sage knows himself—\n――Knowing his own gains and losses.\nHe does not reveal himself—\n――Not displaying his virtue outwardly,\nbut keeping it within.\nHe loves himself—\n――Loving his body to preserve his vital *qi*.\nHe does not exalt himself.\n――Not seeking worldly honor or glory.\nThus he discards that and takes this—\n――Discarding self-revelation and self-exaltation,\ntaking self-knowledge and self-love.\n\n**Chapter 73: Taking Action**\nBrave in daring, he meets death,\n――For daring and bold action\nleads to self-destruction.\nBrave in not daring, he lives.\n――For bravery in restraint\npreserves his life.\nThese two paths—\n――Of daring and not daring—\nbring either benefit or harm.\n――Preserving life is benefit,\nmeeting death is harm.\nHeaven detests contention,\n――Who knows its reason\nand yet does not transgress?\nTherefore, the sage finds it difficult—\n――For the sage’s enlightened virtue\nis difficult even for the daring,\nmuch less for those without virtue\nwho would attempt it.\n\nHeaven’s Dao,\ndoes not contend yet wins through benevolence,\n――For Heaven does not contend with men\nover high and low,\nyet men naturally revere it.\nDoes not speak yet responds appropriately,\n――For Heaven does not speak,\nyet all things move and respond in their proper time.\nDoes not summon yet they come of their own accord,\n――For Heaven does not call,\nyet all things bear the yin and turn toward the yang.\n*[Acts] naturally and yet excels in strategy.*」\n\n「――*\"弹\"* (改丝旁), *宽* also. Heaven’s Dao, though vast and boundless,\nbestows retribution upon good and evil alike—\nits net spreads wide yet nothing escapes.\n――Heaven’s net is vast and far-reaching,\nyet its scrutiny of virtue and vice is never remiss.\n\n**Chapter 74: *On Restraining Deception***\nWhen the people do not fear death,\n――it is because rulers impose cruel punishments,\nleaving them no hope of survival.\nWhen governing the body, lustful desires harm the spirit,\ngreed for wealth risks one’s life—\nyet the people know not to fear.\nHow then can you frighten them with death?\n――If you would make the people fear death,\nfirst remove your own oppressive measures\nand teach them to abandon greed and desire.\nBut if they still rebel—\nthen I shall seize and execute them—\nwho would dare?\n\nOld Master laments the times:\nthe king does not first cultivate virtue and Dao,\nbut instead enforces punishments.\nThose who wield the axe of execution\nstand high above, like Heaven’s own inspectors—\nits net spreads wide yet nothing escapes.\nTo usurp Heaven’s role in execution\nis to act as a clumsy artisan replacing the master carpenter.\n――Heaven’s order is clear: executioners follow its rhythms—\nspring’s birth, summer’s growth, autumn’s harvest, winter’s rest,\nthe stars and constellations moving in their appointed courses.\nYet if a ruler takes this role upon himself,\nhe is like the unskilled replacing the master carpenter—\nhis work will fail, and his hands will suffer.\n――A ruler who presumes to execute\nloses the proper measure—\nand in losing measure, invites calamity.\n\n**Chapter 75: *On Greed’s Harm***\nThe people’s hunger stems from excessive taxation by their rulers.\n――Thus they starve.\nThe people’s unruliness stems from their rulers’ meddling.\n――Thus they are hard to govern.\nThe people’s recklessness with death stems from their pursuit of life being too indulgent.\n――Thus they court death lightly.\nOnly those who do not cling to life\nare truly wiser than those who do.\n――For the sage, neither noble titles nor wealth can sway him,\nnor can kings command his service—\nthus he is wiser than those who cling to life.\n\n**Chapter 76: *On Warning Against Strength***\nWhen a man is born, he is soft and weak.\n――For life’s *qi* is harmonious, his spirit unspent.\nWhen he dies, he grows rigid and strong.\n――For life’s *qi* is exhausted, his spirit gone.\nGrass and trees, when alive, are supple and tender.\n――For life’s *qi* sustains them.\nWhen they die, they wither and decay.\n――For life’s *qi* has departed.\nThus, the rigid and strong belong to death,\nwhile the soft and weak belong to life.\nTherefore, the mighty army does not conquer,\n――For its strength is reckless, its violence unchecked,\nand it provokes united resistance.\nThe sturdy tree splits and falls,\n――For its strength makes its branches brittle.\nThe strong and mighty are placed low,\nwhile the soft and weak are placed high.\n――Thus Heaven’s Dao suppresses the strong and upholds the weak—\na natural order.\n\n**Chapter 77: *On Heaven’s Dao***\nHeaven’s Dao is like drawing a bow.\n――It adjusts the high and low, the excessive and the deficient.\nIt lowers the proud,\nraises the humble,\nreduces the overabundant,\nand supplements the lacking.\n――Thus it harmonizes all things.\nHeaven’s Dao takes from the excess\nto nourish what is deficient.\n――It balances the full and the empty,\never maintaining the middle.\nBut man’s Dao is otherwise:\nhe takes from the deficient\nto indulge the excessive.\n――The greedy strip the poor to enrich the rich,\nthe strong seize from the weak.\nWho, then, can possess abundance\nand yet use it to nourish the world?\nOnly the man of Dao.\n――For only the sage-king can practice this.\nThus the sage acts without claiming credit,\n――His virtue is given, yet he does not boast.\nCompletes his work yet does not dwell on it,\n――His deeds are done, yet he does not cling to position.\nHe does not seek to be seen as wise.\n――For he fears Heaven’s retribution—\nto hoard excess is to invite ruin.\n\n**Chapter 78: *On Trusting in Softness***\nNothing on earth is softer or weaker than water,\n――Yet nothing surpasses it in overcoming the strong.\nIts power is unmatched—\n――It can wear down mountains, fill valleys,\nerode iron, dissolve copper.\nNothing can replace it.\nThe weak overcome the strong,\n――Water extinguishes fire, yin consumes yang.\nThe soft overcomes the hard,\n――The tongue is soft, yet teeth—hard—are worn away first.\nYet none understand this,\nnone practice it.\n――For men despise humility and exalt force.\n\n**Chapter 78: *On Trusting in Softness* (continued)**\n\nThus the Sage says—\n――Speaking of the lowly and humble.\nTo bear a nation’s filth,\n――This is called the Lord of the Soil and Grain.\n――For a ruler who loves his nation’s impurities like the rivers and seas,\n――Not resisting the small currents,\n――Can long preserve its Soil and Grain,\n――And become the sovereign of that land.\n\nTo bear a nation’s ill fortune,\n――This is called the King of All Under Heaven.\n――For a ruler who takes upon himself the calamities of the people,\n――And suffers the ill fates in their place,\n――Can rule over all Under Heaven.\n\nTo speak truth yet appear contrary.\n――This is truth that the world mistakes for deception.\n\n**Chapter 79: *On the Seventh Contract***\nTo repay great grudges with harmony,\n――Those who kill shall die, those who wound shall be punished.\nYet grudges will remain,\n――For harsh retribution loses the people’s favor.\n――And how can this be called good?\n\nThus the Sage holds the left contract—\n――In ancient times, the Sage kept the left contract as a pledge of trust,\n――Without written laws or inscribed covenants to establish faith.\nAnd does not blame others.\n――He only demands the fidelity of the contract itself.\n\nThe virtuous administer the contract,\n――The virtuous ruler oversees the contracts and their fulfillment.\nThe unvirtuous administer the *chè* (彻).\n――The unvirtuous ruler betrays his own words and punishes those who fail him.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven has no favorites,\n――It always sides with the virtuous.\n\n**Chapter 80: *On the Solitude of the Small State***\nIn a small state with few people,\n――Though the Sage governs a great realm, he still acts with moderation,\n――Not indulging in excess, and though the people are many,\n――He treats them as if they were few, never daring to weary them.\nHe ensures each has their *shí-bǎi* (什伯)—\n――Their ranks and duties, so that the noble do not encroach upon the lowly.\n\nHe does not use the people’s tools,\n――He does not conscript or seize their farming implements,\n――Nor take their prime seasons of labor.\n\nHe makes the people value life,\n――If a ruler can benefit the people and remove their harms,\n――Each finding their proper place,\n――Then the people will cherish life and shun death.\n\nAnd not seek distant migration.\n――If governance is unburdened, the people settle in their homes,\n――Never straying far from their accustomed dwellings.\n\nThough there are boats and carriages,\n――He does not ride them—\n――For he cherishes simplicity and avoids ornate display,\n――Nor does he indulge in travel or amusement.\n\nThough there are arms and soldiers,\n――He does not deploy them—\n――For he harms none beneath Heaven.\n\nHe lets the people return to knotted cords,\n――And uses them in trust—\n――Abandoning written laws and reverting to simple, unadulterated faith.\n\nHe delights in their plain food,\n――He delights in their simple vegetables,\n――Not in the fish of the people.\n\nHe beautifies their coarse garments,\n――He beautifies their plain clothes,\n――Not in the splendor of five colors.\n\nHe settles them in thatched dwellings,\n――He settles them in humble huts,\n――Not in grand, adorned houses.\n\nHe finds joy in their customs,\n――He finds joy in their natural simplicity,\n――Not in shifting or corrupting their ways.\n\nNeighboring states are in sight,\n――And the sounds of chickens and dogs drift between them—\n――So close they are.\n\nYet the people, until old age,\n――Do not visit one another—\n――For they have no lustful desires.\n\n**Chapter 81: *On Displaying the Plain***\nFaithful words are not ornate,\n――The faithful are as they are—\n――Not ornate, but simple and plain.\n\nOrnate words are not faithful,\n――Those who heap upon pretty speech—\n――Endless flowery phrases—\n――Are unfaithful, for they adorn falsehoods\n――And indulge in empty, hollow things.\n\nThe good do not argue,\n――The good cultivate the Way in their conduct,\n――Not adopting fine words.\n\nThose who argue are not good,\n――To argue is to use clever speech—\n――And clever speech brings ruin to one’s self.\n\nMountains have jade,\n――Yet digging them exhausts the water.\nRivers have pearls,\n――Yet dredging them muddies the depths.\n――Those who speak much with clever tongues\n――Lose their own lives.\n\nThe wise are not wide-ranging,\n――The wise are those who understand the Way—\n――Not wide-ranging, for they hold to the One.\n\nThe wide-ranging do not know.\n――Those who range widely in knowledge\n――Lose the essential truth.\n\nThe Sage does not hoard,\n――The Sage accumulates virtue, not wealth,\n――To teach the foolish and aid the poor.\n\nThe more he gives to others,\n――The more virtue he has—\n――The more he bestows virtue upon the people,\n――The more virtue he himself possesses.\n\nThe more he gives to others,\n――The more wealth he has—\n――The more he distributes wealth and favors,\n――The more his riches increase,\n――Like the light of the sun and moon,\n――Endless and ever-bright.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven benefits yet does not harm.\n――Heaven nurtures all things to their fullness,\n――Yet does not injure them.\n\nThe Sage’s Dao acts yet does not contend.\n――The Sage follows Heaven’s Way,\n――His actions complete, his deeds fulfilled,\n――He does not vie with the people for fame or praise,\n――Thus preserving his perfect virtue.",

arise.\n\nExcessive speech leads to depletion.\n—Excessive speech harms the body,\nand reckless words bring misfortune.\nBetter to preserve the center.\n\n—Better to cultivate *virtue/power* within,\nnourishing the spirit and *qi*,\nwhile speaking sparingly.\n\nThe sixth chapter completes the form:\n*The Grain Spirit* does not die.\n—This refers to nourishment from the *Grain*.\nIf a person can nourish the spirit,\nthen they will not die.\nThe *spirit* here refers to the vital essences of the Five Organs.\nIf the Five Organs are all injured,\nthen the Five Spirits depart.\n\nThis is called the *Dark Mother*.\n—This speaks of the *Dark* being the source of immortality.\n*Dark* is Heaven.\nIn humans, it is the nose,\nwhich houses the heart,\nwhere the Five *qi* gather in subtle purity—\nthe essence of spirit and clarity,\nthe resonance of sound and the Five Virtues.\nIts ghostly form is called *hun*—\nthe *hun* is masculine,\ngoverning the breath entering and leaving through the nose,\nand communicating with Heaven,\nso the nose is called *Dark*.\n\nEarth nourishes humans with the Five Flavors,\nwhich enter through the mouth\nand lodge in the stomach.\nThe Five Virtues here are turbid and coarse,\nmanifesting as flesh, bones, and sinews,\nwhile the Six Emotions flow through the blood and *vessels*—\nits ghostly form is called *po*.\nThe *po* is feminine,\ngoverning the breath entering and leaving through the mouth,\nand communicating with Heaven and Earth,\nso the mouth is called *Mother*.\n\nThe gate of *Dark Mother*—\nthis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\n—This is the *root element*.\nThe nose and mouth,\ninhaling and exhaling,\nare the pathways through which\nthe primordial *qi* of Heaven and Earth circulates.\nContinuous as silk,\nsubtle as if preserved yet absent.\n\nTo use it without strain.\n—To employ *qi* with ease and moderation,\nnot hastening or exhausting it.\n\nThe seventh chapter conceals its light:\nHeaven endures, Earth persists.\n—This explains Heaven and Earth’s longevity and vitality,\nto enlighten and teach humanity.\n\nWhy Heaven and Earth alone endure so long—\nit is because they do not seek to generate themselves.\n—Heaven and Earth endure uniquely long\nbecause they remain tranquil,\nacting without self-aggrandizement,\nnot seizing others’ benefits to enrich themselves.\nThus, they achieve eternal vitality.\n\nTherefore, the sage places themselves last.\n—This is the principle of prioritizing others before oneself.\nYet their self is foremost.\n—The world holds them in highest respect,\nand they are revered as the longest-lived.\n\nThey set themselves apart.\n—This is to be thin with oneself\nand generous with others.\nYet their self remains.\n—The people love them as parents,\nand the spirit of Heaven aids them\nlike a cherished child,\nso their self is ever preserved.\n\nNot because they lack selfishness.\n—The sage is loved by people and aided by Heaven\nnot because of their impartiality or lack of self-interest.\nThus, they fulfill their own desires.\n\nThe eighth chapter transforms nature:\nThe highest excellence is like water.\n—The person of highest excellence,\nlike water’s nature.\nWater benefits all things.\n—Water in Heaven is mist and dew,\non Earth it is springs and sources.\nYet it does not contend,\ndwelling where others revile.\n—Others detest lowliness, dampness, filth, and turbidity,\nbut water alone flows quietly therein.\nThus, it approaches the Dao.\n\nIt favors the lowly.\n—Water’s nature is to flow downward,\nlike the *Mother* in motion,\nalways descending to benefit humanity.\n\nThe heart favors depth.\n—Water is deep and empty,\nits depths pure and bright.\nIt aligns with *virtue/power*.\n—All things receive water to thrive,\nand it does not hoard what it gives—\nthis is the virtue of generosity.\n\nIt is trustworthy.\n—Water reflects all forms within,\nnever losing its essence.\n\nIt is upright.\n—It cleanses all impurities,\nremaining clear and even.\n\nIt is capable.\n—It adapts to square and round,\nto curves and straightness.\n\nIt acts in due time.\n—In summer it disperses,\nin winter it congeals,\nmoving in accordance with the seasons,\nnever losing its natural rhythm.\n\nOnly because it does not contend.\n—If blocked, it stops;\nif released, it flows—\nit yields to others.\nThus, it meets no blame.\n\nThe ninth chapter balances ease:\nHold and fill it,\nbut it is better to let it be.\n—*Fill* means *satisfied*.\n*Let it be* means *stop*.\nTo grasp at fullness is to invite collapse,\nbetter to cease before excess.\n\nShape and sharpen it,\nbut it cannot be long preserved.\n—*Shape* means *refine*.\nAfter refinement, it must be discarded.\nEven gold and jade in abundance,\nno one can guard them.\n\nWealth and honor bring arrogance,\nand they ruin themselves.\n—Great riches should be used to relieve the poor,\nand high status to cherish the lowly.\nYet if one grows proud and indulgent,\nmisfortune will follow.\nWhen achievement is complete and reputation established,\nretire from the world—\nthis is the Dao of Heaven.\n\nThe tenth chapter speaks of capacity:\nCarry the *hun* and *po*.\n—The *hun* and *po* are the vital spirits.\nHumans carry these spirits above,\nand must cherish them.\nIf one’s joy and anger disturb the *hun*,\nor fright and shock injure the *po*—\nthe *hun* resides in the liver,\nthe *po* in the lungs—\nthen rich wine and sweet delicacies\ncorrupt the lungs’ *po*,\nand the *hun* grows restless,\nwhile the will becomes chaotic and ungrounded.\nYet if the *hun* is tranquil and the *po* settled,\none’s life will be prolonged and years extended.\n\nEmbrace the *One* and remain undivided.\n—This means one can hold the *One* within,\nso it never departs from the body.\nThe *One* is the pure *qi* of the Dao’s origin,\nthe great harmony of primordial essence.\n\nThus, it is called the *One*.\nIts name spreads across the world:\nHeaven gains the *One* to achieve clarity,\nEarth gains the *One* to achieve tranquility,\nand rulers gain the *One* to achieve balance.\nIt enters as the heart,\nand manifests in action.\nIts distribution is called *virtue/power*,\nand its totality is called the *One*.\nThe *One* is the principle of singular will—\nno duality exists.»",

Thus, this is the Dao/Way among the Four Great.\nIt is not as great as the Dao/Way without title.\n\nThe Dao/Way without title cannot be named as *yù* (域).\n—Heaven, Earth, and the King all exist within the Dao/Way without title.\nThus, it is said that within the *yù* (域) are the Four Great, and the King is one of them.\n—Within the Eight Extremes, the Four Great exist, and the King is one of them.\n\nHumans emulate Earth.\n—Humans should emulate Earth’s tranquility, gentleness, and yielding.\nWhen planted, it yields the Five Grains; when dug, it produces sweet springs.\nIt labors yet does not complain, has merit yet does not dominate.\n\nEarth emulates Heaven.\n—Heaven is serene and motionless, giving yet seeking no recompense, fostering and growing all things without taking anything back.\n\nHeaven emulates the Dao/Way.\n—The Dao/Way is pure and silent, acting without speech, its subtle *qi* forming all things naturally.\n\nThe Dao/Way emulates *zìrán* (自然).\n—The Dao/Way’s nature is *zìrán* (自然); it follows nothing external.\n\n**Chapter 26: The Weight of Virtue**\n*Chóng* (重) is the root of *qīng* (轻).\n—When the ruler does not hold virtue in high regard, it is not honored. In governing oneself, if virtue is not cherished, the spirit is lost. Flowers of grasses and trees are light, so they wither and fall; roots are heavy, so they endure long.\n\n*Jìng* (静) is the master of *zào* (躁).\n—If the ruler is not tranquil, authority is lost.

This cannot be tolerated in the world.\n\nAuspicious rites favor the left.\n—The left is the position of life.\n\nInauspicious rites favor the right.\n—The right aligns with the *yin* path of death.\n\nThe *Pian* (偏) General resides on the left.\n—The *Pian* General, though lowly, occupies the *yang* position because he does not wield absolute authority over life and death.\n\nThe *Shang* (上) General resides on the right.\n—The *Shang* General, being honored, occupies the right, signifying his role in execution.\n\nThis is treated with funeral rites.\n—The *Shang* General, on the right, follows funeral customs, as death is honored with *yin*.\n\nThe multitude of slain are mourned with sorrowful weeping.\n—This reflects a ruler’s moral failing—his inability to transform others through virtue, leading to the slaughter of the innocent.\n\nVictory is treated with funeral rites.\n—In antiquity, victorious generals observed mourning rites, occupying the funeral position. They wore plain mourning attire and wept, demonstrating that the virtuous value morality over warfare and do not rejoice in bloodshed. They grieve because they foresee future wars.\n\n**Chapter 32: *Sheng* (圣, Sacred Virtue)**\nThe Dao is ever nameless.\n—The Dao manifests as both *yin* and *yang*, expands and contracts, preserves and destroys; thus, it has no fixed name.\n\nThough crude and simple, it is not subdued by the world.\n—The Dao, though subtle and formless, is so profound that the world dare not enslave it.\n\nIf lords and kings could uphold it, all things would submit of their own accord.\n—If lords and kings could preserve the Dao and act without contrivance, all things would naturally revere and obey their virtue.\n\nHeaven and Earth unite, and sweet dew descends.\n—When a ruler’s actions harmonize with Heaven, auspicious signs appear, such as the descent of sweet dew.\n\nThe people govern themselves without command.\n—When Heaven bestows blessings, no orders are needed; all things naturally align in balance.\n\nOnly then does naming begin.\n—*Beginning* (始) refers to the Dao. *Naming* refers to all things. The Dao, though nameless, governs the named; the formless governs the formed.\n\nOnce names are established,\n—*Established* (既) means \"exhausted.\" Once all things have names, they develop desires and stray from the Dao, losing their virtue, and thus bring ruin upon themselves.\n\nHeaven will know this.\n—If a person abandons the Dao and pursues virtue, Heaven will recognize it.\n\nThis is how one avoids peril.\n—Heaven’s recognition brings divine protection, ensuring safety.\n\nThe Dao in the world is like rivers and valleys to the sea.\n—The Dao’s relationship with the world is akin to how rivers and valleys flow into the sea.\n\n**Chapter 33: *Bian* (辩, Discerning Virtue)**\nTo know others is wisdom.",

      "translated_text": "――Lamenting words. Hence, when many parts are gathered without a name, they become a chariot.\n――\"Gathered\" means brought together. When people bring together spokes, wheels, hubs, crossbars, and carriages, there is no name for them as a chariot—yet they are called a chariot. Thus, it is to enlighten the feudal lords and kings: they do not name themselves with exalted titles, yet they achieve their nobility.\n\nDo not desire brilliance like jade,\nnor coarseness like stone.\n――\"Brilliance\" signifies scarcity;\n\"coarseness\" signifies abundance.\nJade is scarce, hence its nobility;\nstone is abundant, hence its lowliness.\nMeaning, one should not desire to be like jade, prized by others,\nnor like stone, despised by others—\nrather, one should dwell in moderation.\n\n**Chapter Forty: The Way’s Movement is Return**\n――Returning to the origin. The origin is the Way by which all things are generated.\n――Generation gives rise to all things; abandoning it leads to their extinction.\nThe Way’s use is in the weak.\n――The Way habitually employs softness and weakness, hence its enduring power.\nAll things under heaven are born from the existent.\n――All things arise from Heaven and Earth, which have form and position—hence, \"born from the existent.\"\nThe existent is born from the nonexistent.\n――Heaven and Earth, subtle and luminous,\nwhere insects dart and worms wriggle—\nall these arise from the Way.\nThe Way is formless, hence \"born from the nonexistent.\"\nThis says the origin surpasses ornamentation,\nthe weak surpass the strong,\nand humility surpasses fullness.\n\n**Chapter Forty-One: The Way of Uniformity and Diversity**\nThe superior man, hearing the Way, strives to practice it.\n――The superior man, hearing the Way, exerts himself earnestly, as if straining all his strength to follow it.\nThe middle man, hearing the Way, holds it lightly, as if it might vanish.\n――The middle man, hearing the Way, applies it to self-cultivation for longevity,\nand to governance for lasting peace—\nhis joyful adherence may falter\nwhen tempted by wealth, desire, or honor,\nand he may then abandon it.\nThe inferior man, hearing the Way, laughs at it.\n――The inferior man, greedy and desiring much,\nsees the Way’s softness as terrifying,\nits plainness as vulgar—\nhence, he laughs at it.\nNot to laugh is not sufficient for the Way.\n――If the Way is not mocked by the inferior man, it cannot be named as the Way.\nThus, I set forth these paradoxes:\n――*Setting forth* means establishing.\nEstablishing words to illustrate the Way, as in the following:\n\nThe enlightened man appears as if in darkness.\n――The man who understands the Way seems as if he sees nothing.\nThe one who advances the Way appears as if retreating.\n――He who pursues the Way seems to fall behind.\nThe one who smooths the Way appears as if conforming to others.\n――*Smoothing* means making plain.\nThe man of great Way does not distinguish himself;\nhe follows the multitude.\nThe man of supreme virtue appears as if in a valley.\n――The man of supreme virtue does not scorn filth and humiliation,\nbut remains in the depths like a valley.\nGreat purity appears as if in shame.\n――The man of great purity does not flaunt his cleanliness,\nbut seems stained like one who has labored.\nAmple virtue appears as if insufficient.\n――The man of vast virtue seems as if lacking,\nnot boasting of his attainments.\nEstablishing virtue appears as if hollow.\n――The man who establishes virtue seems as if it could be stolen,\nhis integrity not fully realized.\nPlain truth appears as if tainted.\n――The plain and true man seems as if his colors have faded,\nhis meaning obscured.\nThe man of great harmony has no angles.\n――The man of perfect harmony has no crookedness or sharp edges.\nGreat vessels are fashioned late.\n――Great vessels, like the Nine Cauldrons and the jade stands,\ncannot be rushed to completion.\nGreat sound is rare in voice.\n――Great sound, like thunder waiting its moment,\nis often silent, its voice scarce.\nGreat image is formless.\n――The man of great law and image is plain and unadorned,\nhis essence without outward shape.\nThe Way is hidden and nameless.\n――The Way is subtle and concealed,\nso that men cannot point to it and name it.\n\nOnly the Way is good at lending,\nand it is certain to repay.\n――*Repay* means fulfill.\nThe Way lends its vital *qi* to all,\nand it is certain to bring them to fruition.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Two: The Way’s Transformation**\nThe Way gives birth to One.\n――The Way’s first generation is One.\nOne generates Two.\n――One generates Yin and Yang.\nTwo generates Three.\n――Yin and Yang generate harmonious *qi*;\nthe Way’s Three *qi* then divide into Heaven, Earth, and Man.\nThree generates the Ten Thousand Things.\n――Heaven and Earth together give birth to the Ten Thousand Things.\nHeaven bestows, Earth transforms,\nand Man nurtures them.\nAll things under heaven carry Yin within them\nand embrace Yang.\n――All things without fail lean toward Yin and seek Yang,\ntheir hearts returning to the sun.\nThe interplay of *qi* brings harmony.\n――Within all things, there is vital *qi*—\nwhen it is balanced and gentle,\nit is like a hidden bone within the chest,\nor marrow within the spine,\nor the void within plants—\nthis *qi* flows freely, hence their enduring life.\n\nWhat men detest is the \"Lonely and Bereft\" (孤寡不毂),\nyet kings and nobles take it as their name.\n――\"Lonely and Bereft\" (孤寡不毂) is an ominous title,\nyet kings and nobles adopt it—\nfor they dwell in the law of humility,\nemptiness, harmony, and gentleness.\nThus, some things may be diminished\nyet still grow stronger.\n――If one pulls, it must return;\nif one pushes, it must still revert.\nOr some things may be increased\nyet still grow weaker.\n――He who raises himself too high will crumble;\nhe who hoards wealth will invite disaster.\nThis is what men are taught.\n――The masses are taught to discard weakness for strength,\nand softness for rigidity.\nI too teach this—\nbut in reverse:\n――I teach men to discard strength for weakness,\nand rigidity for softness.\n\nThe strong and rigid will not meet their end.\n――The strong and rigid are those who do not trust in the mysterious,\nwho defy the Way and do not follow its teachings,\nbut rely on power and force.\nThey will not die a natural death—\nfor Heaven will cut them off,\nweapons will strike them down,\nand the law will execute them.\nI shall make this my first lesson.\n――*Lesson* means beginning.\nLaozi takes the strong and rigid as the starting point for teaching.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Three: Universal Application**\nThe softest thing under heaven\novercomes the hardest thing under heaven.\n――The softest is water;\nthe hardest is metal and stone.\nWater can penetrate hardness,\nenter rigidity—\nnothing it cannot pass through.\nIt has no gaps in its passage.\n――*It* refers to the Way.\nThe Way, being formless and without substance,\ncan enter and exit without obstruction,\npenetrating the spirit and sustaining all life.\nThus, I know the benefits of *wuwei*.\n――I see that the Way’s *wuwei* allows all things to transform naturally—\nhence, I know the benefits of *wuwei* for men.\n\nThe teaching that is not spoken.\n――The Way’s teaching is not given in words,\nbut through example.\nThe benefits of *wuwei*.\n――The Way’s teaching of *wuwei* brings benefit:\nto self-cultivation through spiritual refinement,\nto governance through blessing the people—\nwithout exertion or trouble.",

virtue.\nNone knowing his limits,\nHe can have a state.\n—None knowing the limits of his virtue,\nHe can possess land and people,\nBringing lasting fortune to the common folk.\nA state’s foundation,\nCan endure forever.\n—The state and the body are the same.\n*Foundation*, as in *Dao*.\nIf one can preserve the Dao within his body,\nHis *qi* and essence unexhausted,\nHis five senses unstrained,\nThen he can endure forever.\nThis is called *deep-rooted and firm-based*,\n—If one can take *qi* as root and essence as base,\nLike a tree whose roots are not deep,\nThen its branches and base are not firm,\nAnd it will fall.\nIt is said that one should deeply conceal his *qi*,\nFirmly guard his essence,\nPreventing any leakage.\n\nThe Dao of *long life and enduring vision*.\n—Deep-rooted and firm-based\nIs the Dao of long life and enduring vision.\n\n**Chapter 60: Occupying a Position**\nTo govern a great state is like cooking a small fish.\n—*Fish*, as in *delicate*.\nCooking a small fish,\nOne does not remove its entrails,\nDoes not scrape its scales,\nDoes not dare to disturb it,\nFor fear it will spoil.\nIf governance is troublesome,\nThe common folk will rebel below;\nIf self-cultivation is troublesome,\nThe *qi* and essence will scatter.\n\nWith the Dao governing the world,\nIts spirits are not *numinous*.\n—With virtue and the Dao in position,\nThe spirits dare not manifest their *numinous* power\nTo harm the people.\n\nNot that its spirits lack *numinous* power,\nBut that their *numinous* power does not harm people.\n—The spirits are not without *numinous* power;\nOnly through failing to uphold the *Eight Virtues*\nCan one harm the natural disposition of others.\nNot that their *numinous* power cannot harm people,\nThe Sage also does not harm.\n—Only spirits and *numinous* power can harm people;\nSince the Sage in position does not harm people,\nThe spirits dare not interfere.\n\nThus the two do not harm each other,\n—The spirits and the Sage both\nDo not harm each other.\nHence virtue returns and converges.\n\n**Chapter 61: Humble Virtue**\nA great state is like a *low-lying stream*,\n—In governing a great state,\nOne should be like a stream in low-lying places,\nNot opposing the minutiae.\n\nThe gathering of the world,\n—The great state is where the world’s scholars and common folk\nConverge and interact.\n\nThe *yin* of the world.\n—*Yin*, as in *female*.\nSoft, humble, and yielding,\nYet not boastful.\n*Yin* always overcomes *yang* through stillness,\n—The female overcomes the male,\nAs *yin* overcomes *yang* through tranquility,\nAnd fulfillment without seeking first.\n\nWith stillness as the *low-lying*.\n—The Dao of *yin* is humble through stillness.\nThus a great state subjugates small states,\nAnd takes them.",

      "translated_text": "「――If one can be humble and lowly,\nThen one will always possess it.\nThe small state, if humble before the great state,\nWill take the great state.\n—This says that a state, whether large or small,\nIf it holds to humility and nurtures the people,\nWill have no faults.\n\nThus, sometimes one is humble to take,\nSometimes one is humble and takes.\n—*Humble* here means the great state being humble before the small state,\nAnd the small state being humble before the great state,\nExchanging them through righteousness.\n\nThe great state does not seek to annex and nurture others,\n—The great state should not lose what it has,\nBut rather absorb and tend to other states.\nThe small state does not seek to serve others,\n—To make them into subjects and servants.\n\nBoth sides thus obtain what they desire,\nAnd the greater should act humbly.\n—The great state and the small state each desire what they seek,\nAnd the great state should also practice humility.\n\n**Chapter 62: The Way**\nThe Way is the hidden essence of all things.\n—*Essence*, meaning *hidden*.\nThe Way is the hidden treasure of all things,\nAnd contains all without exception.\n\nThe treasure of the virtuous,\n—The virtuous take the Way as their personal treasure,\nAnd dare not defy it.\nThe refuge of the unvirtuous.\n—The Way is also the refuge of the unvirtuous.\nWhen disaster strikes or urgency arises,\nThey still know to repent, humble themselves, and submit.\n\nBeautiful words can be sold,\n—*Beautiful words* are only useful in the marketplace,\nFor in trade, once the exchange is done,\nThe parties part ways—no further harmony remains.\nGood words and fine speech,\nThe seeker wants to acquire them quickly,\nThe seller wants to sell them quickly.\n\nNoble conduct can be bestowed upon others.\n—*Bestow*, meaning *distinguish*.\nA person with noble conduct can surpass the common man,\nYet this is still insufficient to honor the Way.\n\nWhat should be done with those who are unvirtuous?\n—Though unvirtuous, they should be transformed by the Way.\nBefore the Three Sovereigns,\nThere were no abandoned people—\nTheir virtue was pure and their teachings refined.\n\nThus, the Son of Heaven is established,\nAnd the Three Ministers appointed,\n—To teach and transform the unvirtuous.\n\nEven with a jade tablet and four horses leading the way,\nIt is not as good as sitting and embracing this Way.\n—Though one arrives with a precious jade tablet\nAnd fine horses ahead,\nIt is still not as good as sitting and embracing this Way.\n\nWhy did the ancients value this Way so highly?\nNot because they sought it and obtained it daily,\n—The ancients valued this Way\nNot by daily searching for it externally,\nBut by attaining it within themselves.\n\nOr to atone for guilt?\n—*Guilt* refers to those in chaotic times\nUnder tyrannical rulers who met with unjust punishment.\nPracticing the Way can absolve death\nAnd spare them from the masses.\n\nThus, it is held in highest regard.\n\n**Chapter 63: The Beginning of Favor**\nTo act without acting,\n—To follow what is already formed,\nAnd thus make no artificial constructions.\nTo manage without managing,\n—To prepare in advance,\nAnd thus eliminate troublesome affairs.\nTo taste without tasting.\n—To think deeply and plan far ahead,\nAnd thus savor the Way’s meaning.\n\nGreat or small, much or little,\n—To set forth warnings and orders.\nTo desire greatness is to return to smallness,\nTo desire much is to return to little,\nThe natural course of things.\n\nTo repay resentment with virtue.\n—To practice the Way and do good,\nAnd thus prevent disaster before it arises.\n\nTo plan for difficulty when it is easy,\n—To plan for great challenges\nWhen they are still in their early, unformed stages.\nTo build the great from the small.\n—To undertake great matters,\nOne must begin with small ones—\nFor calamities arise from small beginnings.\n\nThe most difficult things in the world\nMust be addressed when they are easy.\nThe greatest things in the world\nMust be addressed when they are small.\n\nThus, the Sage never pursues the great.\n—By remaining humble and modest,\nHe can achieve the greatest.\n\nAnd so he attains the great.\n—The world unites under him.\n\nHe who makes light of promises will be lacking in trustworthiness,\n—He does not take his words seriously.\nHe who takes on too much will encounter many difficulties,\n—He does not guard against misfortune.\n\nThus, the Sage treats even these matters with caution,\n—The Sage, in all his actions and undertakings,\nWeighs them carefully, advancing and retreating with difficulty,\nTo block their origins.\n\nAnd so he never encounters difficulty.\n—The Sage, throughout his life,\nAvoids misfortune as one avoids deep harm.\n\n**Chapter 64: Guarding the Subtle**\nIts ease lies in its stability,\n—To govern oneself and the state,\nThe stable is easy to uphold.\nIts unmanifested state is easy to plan for,\n—When desires and disasters\nHave not yet taken form,\nThey are easy to correct in advance.\nIts fragility is easy to break,\n—When calamities have not yet stirred in court\nAnd desires have not yet shown on the face,\nThey are as fragile as glass and easy to dispel.\nIts subtlety is easy to disperse.\n—When it is not yet manifest,\nIts subtlety is easy to eliminate.\n\nTo act before it exists,\n—To undertake anything,\nOne must do so before its roots take hold.\nTo govern before it is disordered.\n—To govern oneself and the state,\nOne must act before disorder arises,\nAnd preemptively close the door.\n\nA tree as thick as one’s embrace\nGrows from a tiny sprout,\n—A thing grows from small to great.\nA nine-tiered tower\nRises from a pile of soil.\n—A thing ascends from low to high.\nA thousand-li journey\nBegins beneath one’s feet.\n—A thing extends from near to far.\n\nTo act is to court ruin,\n—Artificial action ruins naturalness.\nTo grasp is to lose.\n—To cling to gain invites misfortune;\nTo cling to the Way preserves the body,\nYet if one refuses to yield or return,\nOne loses.\n\nThe Sage acts without acting,\nAnd thus meets with no ruin,\n—The Sage does not indulge in empty words,\nNor in material gain or violence,\nAnd so suffers no destruction.\nHe does not grasp,\nAnd thus loses nothing.\n—The Sage, with virtue, teaches the foolish,\nAnd with wealth, aids the poor,\nHolding nothing back,\nAnd thus loses nothing to others.\n\nThe people, in their undertakings,\nOften ruin what is nearly complete.\n—*From*, meaning *to do*.\nThe people, in their affairs,\nOften, when success is nearly achieved,\nGrow greedy for position, fame, extravagance, and excess,\nAnd thus ruin themselves.\n\nTo be as careful at the end as at the beginning,\nThen there will be no ruined affairs.\n—The end must be as diligent as the beginning,\nLest one grow negligent.\n\nThus, the Sage desires what others do not desire,\n—The Sage desires what others do not,\nAnd what others make manifest,\nThe Sage conceals.\nWhat others adorn,\nThe Sage keeps plain.\nWhat others value in appearance,\nThe Sage values in virtue.\n\nHe does not prize difficult-to-obtain goods,\n—The Sage is not dazzled by fine clothing,\nNor does he devalue stone while
