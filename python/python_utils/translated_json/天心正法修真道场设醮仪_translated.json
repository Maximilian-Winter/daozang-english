assembly of officials kneel in reverence.\nNext, let the **High Merit Master** emerge to receive the scriptures, registers, and assume office.\n\nWe now reverently summon the **True Officials of the

Virtue**, the **Supreme Heavenly Thearch Who Grasps the Talisman, Presides Over the Calendar, and Embodies the Dao**, the **Utmost Revered Jade Thearch of the Vast Heaven**, the **Holy Ancestor, Upper

Virtue**, all the **True Immortals**, and the **Officials of the Three Realms**—\n\nWe, by virtue of karmic causes from past lives, have presumptuously undertaken the practice of the Dharma teachings. On this day of covenant and alliance, we pledge to uphold and maintain our vows.\n\nWe reverently uphold the true Dao and honor the Dharma assemblies. Awaiting the most earnest oversight of the divine monitors, we beseech the granting of extraordinary grace in deliverance. Humbly we pray that luminous blessings be bestowed and sacred favor be abundantly conferred. May we be freed from the entanglements of the mundane realm, that the Dao and qi may fill us to overflowing. May boundless beneficence be extended, and malevolent forces be banished beyond all reckoning. We await only the sagely decree, humbly receiving our earnest supplications.\n\nYour servant [Name], with utmost reverence and awe, prostrates in deepest urgency, respectfully presenting this entreaty.\n\nNext, the *Dujang* leads the chanting, each declaring their Dharma rank. The Dao assembly silently recites their received scriptures and registers of office.\n\nWe, the High Merit Dharma Masters and recipients of the scriptures and registers, your servants [Names], together with utmost sincerity, respectfully address:\n\nThe Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void and Spontaneous Nativity, the Limitless Great Dao Most High Lord of the Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the August Emperor of Supreme Virtue of the Primal Origin, the Heavenly Jade Thearch of the Vast Sky Who Upholds the Talisman, Governs the Calendar, and Embodies the True Dao; the Sacred Ancestor, Supreme Numinous High Dao, Nine Heavens Controller of Destiny, Celestial Worthy Great Emperor Who Preserves Life; the Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity Heavenly Thearch; the Great Emperor of the Northern Culmen of the Purple Tenuity; the August Queen of Earth, Divine Thearch of the Primordial Sky, Great Sage of the Posterity of Heaven Who Responds to the Dao, Embodying Profound Virtue and Radiant Magnanimity; the Sun, Moon, and Stellar Lodges; the Four Offices of Heaven and Earth; the Imperial Throne within the Dipper; the Three Treasuries and Three Officials; the Sacred Assembly of the Heavenly Pivot Institute and the Northern Culmen Demon-Dispelling Institute; the Perfected Immortals of the Wondrous Register of the Northern Thearch and the Dharma Records of the Central Truth; the Divine Immortals of the Five Marchmounts, Four Waterways, Grotto-Heavens, and Blessed Lands; the Divine Immortals of the Three Realms; and the Host of Sages of the Ten Directions.\n\nWe have heard that the generation of Heaven and Earth began before the inception of images and thearchs. Without trace or sound, it merged with the subtlety of the formless and inaudible.\n\nAll beings are governed by the numinous, and the Great Dao is their ultimate source. It unfurls its boundless compassion to succor all things and manifests the sublime Dharma of supplication. This humble disciple of the Most High, with reverent devotion and earnest intent, prostrates himself for the sake of his humble form. He solemnly arranges the sacred banners and prepares the jade altar with due rites. He invokes the turning of the Wheel and the arrival of the divine chariot, praying that the celestial sojourn to the Golden Towers may be turned toward this place. With trepidation in his heart, he awaits the abundant blessings to come. Gazing upward toward the Purple Vault, he reverently awaits the radiant imperial carriage. May the divine presence deign to descend and partake of the purified offerings.\n\nThis minister and the disciples of the Most High, with utmost urgency and devotion, bow twice in earnest supplication.\n\nNext, the Daoist priests recite the divine names to invoke the saints.\nNext, incense is offered.\nTea is presented.\nWine is offered.\nNext, the officiant sounds the chime and performs the initial offering, circumambulating the altar.\nNext, the officiant sounds the chime and chants the *Step-in-Emptiness Verses*:\nBowing to the Most High, burning incense to return to the Void.\nLuminous radiance follows me as I turn; the Dharma Wheel completes three cycles.\nMysterious vows arise in the Four Directions; numinous blessings extend to kings and lords.\nSeven generations of ancestors ascend to Heaven’s halls, resplendent in glorious light.\nWhistling and singing, I contemplate the Great Expanse; celestial music delights my spirit.\nIn unison, we offer fragrant homage to the supreme virtue; even the lower immortals cannot compare.\nWondrous forms illumine primordial awakening; in serried ranks, they traverse the Void.\n\nNext, the chief cantor intones the names and titles of the deities.\nThe assembly silently recites the scriptures, registers, and official duties they have received.\n\nThis humble servant, the High Ritual Master who has received the scriptures, registers, and Dharma ranks, along with the disciples of the Most High, jointly and sincerely address the following:\nThe Three Clarities and Supreme Saints, the Four August Thearchs and Lofty Perfected, the Lord of the Golden Towers, the Prime Minister of the Pure Capital, the stellar lodges of the Vault of Heaven, the divine immortals of the Vast Earth, the numinous powers of the Three Realms, and the host of sages of the Ten Directions.\n\nWe have heard that all who bear the heavens upon their heads and tread upon the earth are nurtured by the generative power of the Great Dao. They partake of virtue and drink of harmony, for all are shaped by the creative work of the myriad spirits. Every being within the bounds of the world enjoys the beneficent care of the Dao. Yet, being ignorant and unknowing, how can we ever repay such boundless grace?\n\nThis disciple of the Most High declares: By the merit of past lives, I have sheltered beneath the Dao’s shade and glimpsed its written precepts. I aspire to enter the Gate of Purity and vow to receive the office of Primordial Perfection. Grateful for the favor of your compassionate regard, I deepen my reverence and devotion. Therefore, for such-and-such a matter at such-and-such a place, I strictly adhere to the ritual protocols and widely initiate the offering of incense and cultivation. I establish the altar and reverently invoke the true ranks of the deities, hoping that your blessings may flow abundantly and that lasting peace and security may be preserved.\n\nWe humbly pray that the Supreme Saints may turn their radiant light toward us and that the divine immortals may deign to witness our sincerity. May your swift chariots briefly descend to observe the purity of our hearts. We are filled with earnest entreaty and steadfast in our devotion. The words of this disciple of the Most High are now respectfully presented.\n\nNext, the Orthodox Unity Dharma Master ascends to recite the petition.\nThe words of the disciple of the Most High have been respectfully submitted; we await your gracious reception and favorable response. May you bestow your boundless compassion and grant us immeasurable blessings.\n\nWe have heard that the Three Clarities roam in mystery, and the myriad saints are revered in their loftiness. They cannot be sought through sight or sound, nor can they be described in words. Today, this disciple of the Most High reverently serves the Supreme Heaven and takes refuge in the Great Dao. He embodies the esoteric teachings of the true canon and cultivates himself according to the profound Dharma. Yet, fearing the transgressions of past lives may incur hidden retribution, he now strictly adheres to the ritual protocols and grandly inaugurates this offering. He welcomes the lofty perfected of the Three Realms and invites the august saints of the Nine Heavens. With reverence, he presents purified offerings, hoping for the descent of the divine immortals.\n\nWe humbly pray that the mind of the Dao may remain pure and undivided, and that worldly entanglements may dissolve. May this ephemeral body be preserved, and the teachings of self-cultivation be fulfilled. Thereafter, may we attain longevity and enduring vision, completing our practice and perfecting our merit. May the grace extend to both the living and the deceased, and may blessings forever secure the protection of our masters.\n\nThis minister and the disciples of the Most High, with utmost urgency and devotion, bow twice in earnest supplication.\n\nNext, incense is offered.\nWine is presented.\nNext, the officiant sounds the chime and performs the secondary offering.\nNext, the officiant sounds the chime and intones the *Hymn of the Great Immortal Learners*:\nTo learn immortality is to renounce worldly splendor; each thought accumulates upon the last.\nComing and going disturb my spirit; its restlessness prevents attainment.\nExtinguishing thoughts, I rest in tranquil emptiness; in solitude, I enter profound stillness.\nI seek the scriptures as if parched with thirst, holding fast to my resolve like unyielding metal or stone.\nMay you safeguard the path to immortality for your disciple; may the Five Numinous Ones transmit the registers of transcendence.\n\nThis minister respectfully and earnestly addresses the following:\nThe Imperial Throne of the Northern Culmen, the August Lords of the Sun and Moon, the venerable stars of the Five Planets and Four Luminaries, the Great Saints of the Northern Dipper and Southern Culmen, the Three Officials and their sovereigns, the True Lords of the Five Thearchs, the stellar deities of the Twenty-Eight Lodges, the host of saints of the Heavenly Pivot Institute, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, the Three Heavens’ Great Dharma Masters, the Three Masters of the Numinous Treasure Scriptures and Registers, the host of saints of the Northern Culmen Demon-Dispelling Institute, and all the divine beings and celestial configurations of the Vault of Heaven.\n\nWe humbly acknowledge that the Prime Minister of the Pure Capital spreads the work of the mysterious transformation, and the great deities of the Purple Palace assist with impartial virtue. They emerge with the seasons and embody all things with benevolence. We bow our heads in reverence to present our plea, hoping for your compassionate regard.\n\nThis disciple of the Most High, having early taken refuge in the true teachings, is unworthily called to serve as an officiant. His aspiration lies in cultivation and his heart in benefiting others. He promotes the ritual protocols and bears the numinous talismans, reverently following the benevolence of the Supreme Thearch to universally relieve the suffering of the people. Therefore, he solemnly arranges the jade altar and invites the descent of the cloud chariots. He hopes for your gracious favor to widely bless all beings, both animate and inanimate.\n\nWe humbly pray that the mind of the Dao may remain steadfast and upright, and that the power of the Dharma may flourish. May the true qi be preserved within this body, and the transgressions of past kalpas be dissolved. May merit extend to our masters and grace encompass all living beings. We look upward, hoping for your illuminating gaze to fulfill our prayers.\n\nThis minister and the disciples of the Most High, with utmost urgency and devotion, bow twice in earnest supplication.\n\nNext, incense is offered thrice.\nWine is presented.\nBroth is offered.\nNext, the officiant sounds the chime and performs the tertiary offering.\nNext, the officiant sounds the chime and intones the *Processional Hymn of Departure from the Hall*:\nThe Dao prioritizes purification; through diligent practice, one ascends to the Golden Towers.\nThus, the great Dharma bridge is established to universally deliver all beings.\nRepaying the kindness of past lives, the mind of the Dao arises transcendent.\nThe body ascends to the immortal capital; seven generations of ancestors are all liberated.\n\nThis minister respectfully and earnestly addresses the following:\nThe August Lords of the Five Marchmounts, the Dragon Deities of the Four Seas, the sacred peaks and grotto-heavens, the tranquil hermitages and blessed lands, the Ten Continents and Three Isles, the Four Waterways and Hundred Rivers, the immortal officials of the administrative offices, the Great Saints of Ascension, the celestial bureaucrats and their subordinates, the deities of the earthly realms, the immortal functionaries and divine generals, the officials of the registers and numinous officers, the sovereigns of the netherworld, the deities of water and land, the numinous powers of the Three Realms, and the supreme saints of the Ten Directions.\n\nWe humbly acknowledge that Heaven stands as a mighty screen, majestic in its fourfold dominion, while Earth shapes its forms, towering as the fivefold pillars of the directions. Together they receive the Emperor’s favor and divide their governance over the human realm. With reverent sincerity we present our plea, hoping for compassionate witness.\n\nThe disciple of the Most High, having received the transmission of the Dao, declares: from early days I have revered the subtleties of the Way and vowed to bear the true talismans. To accomplish the work of aiding beings, one must rely on the arts of cultivating perfection. Thus we have widely performed purifications and offered fragrant incense. We now open the altar precincts and reverently conduct the jiao rites.\n\nWe pray that the heart of Heaven will assist in harmony, that the principles of the divine will draw near to humanity. May all perverse and demonic forces be eradicated from the nine depths, and majestic virtue extend universally to the ten thousand kinds. Thereafter, may subjects and ministers enjoy peace, together rejoicing beneath a Yao-like sky; may the Dao and its methods flourish, aiding the enduring succession of a Zhou-like dynasty.\n\nThis minister and the disciples of the Most High, with utmost fervor and devotion, bow twice in profound reverence. Having proclaimed the transmission protocols and presented the ritual money and horses, we now make this declaration. Next, we humbly address again:\n\nThis minister respectfully and earnestly addresses...\n\nThe Three Pure Lords, the Perfected Immortals of the Ten Poles, the divine spirits of seas and mountains, the celestial and terrestrial immortals, the officials and attendants of the Three Realms, and all majestic numina—now that the triple offering of rites has been completed and words need not be repeated, we await the presence of the true spirits and pause the ranks of their retinue. Fearful of overstaying our reverence, we prostrate ourselves in trepidation.\n\nWe pray that the true spirits of the upper realms return each to their jeweled palaces, and that the host of sages below resume their immortal courts. As their radiant light has turned toward this altar, so must blessings descend upon this auspicious night.\n\nThis minister and the disciples of the Most High, unable to contain our devotion and supplication, bow twice in profound reverence as we humbly send forth this offering.\n\nNext, the sounding of the chime signals the Hymn of Sending Forth the Gods:\n*Returning to till the five-cloud chariot,*\n*Ascending with the Nine Songs’ melody.*\n*Swiftly soaring, far into the heavens,*\n*The altar’s incense and qi abound.*\n*Mysterious grace pervades the cosmos,*\n*Fortune and prosperity fill mountains and rivers.*\n*Gazing afar at the immortals’ path,*\n*Freely they roam above the Great Loft.*\n\nNext, the High Master of Rituals resumes his office:\nThis minister announces the completion of the jiao rites. All the dispatched messengers and attendants of the merit officials shall now return to my person—entering through the Gate of Myriad Mysteries, those on the left return to the left, those on the right return to the right. The direct messenger and merit officials shall resume their oversight and inspection, returning to their original positions without error. When summoned again, they shall arrive promptly as before.\n\nNext, the High Master of Rituals restores the incense burner:\nIncense officials, the Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, and all attending spirit officials—at this place where the jiao rites are held, may golden nectar, cinnabar-green mushrooms, and azure herbs spontaneously arise. May the hundred spirits and host of perfected ones gather here before this incense burner.\n\nWe pray that the disciples of the Most High and this minister, recipients of blessings, may be favored by the ten directions. May jade lads and immortal maidens attend the fragrant smoke, swiftly conveying the sincerity of our earlier prayers directly to the presence of the Utmost True, Boundless, and Great Dao—the August Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven.\n\nNext, the sounding of the chime signals the Hymn of China’s Splendor.\n\nNext, proceed to the site for burning the prayer texts and stand in order.\n\nNext, present incense, recite the offering words, pour the libation, and bow in retreat.\n\nNext, the sounding of the chime signals the Hymn of Dedication:\nAll the merit of the jiao rites performed is dedicated to the disciples of the Most High, this minister, and all who have participated, that together we may rely on this virtuous act to attain the supreme Dao and all who have offered reverence.\n\nNext, the High Master of Rituals recites the Dedication of Merit:\nOn behalf of the disciple of the Most High, [Name], who seeks grace, repents transgressions, accumulates blessings, and dispels calamities, we invoke:\nThe Great Sage, Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning;\nThe Boundless Great Dao, Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Treasure;\nThe Most High Lord Lao;\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Purple Clarity Who Bestows Blessings;\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Prolongs Life and Augments Destiny;\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Preserves Life and Protects Destiny;\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Eight Trigrams Who Guards the Body;\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Nine Palaces Who Defends Against Misfortune;\nThe Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions’ Numinous Treasure;\nThe Great Compassionate Perfected of the Solar Canopy;\nThe Great Merciful Perfected of the Lunar Stillness;\nThe Perfected of Southern Prosperity Who Extends Longevity;\nThe Perfected of the Three Pure Ones’ Jade Treasury;\nAnd all the immortals and sages of Jade Capital Mountain—whose merits are beyond conception.\n\nNext, the sounding of the chime signals the conclusion of the rites and the disciples’ withdrawal from their positions.\n\nThe altar for cultivating the true Dao in accordance with the Orthodox Heart of Heaven’s Dharma has now completed its jiao rites.",

Yet, being ignorant and unknowing, how can we ever repay such boundless grace?\n\nThis disciple of the Most High declares: By the merit of past lives, I have sheltered beneath the Dao’s shade and glimpsed its written precepts. I aspire to enter the Gate of Purity and vow to receive the office of Primordial Perfection. Grateful for the favor of your compassionate regard, I deepen my reverence and devotion. Therefore, for such-and-such a matter at such-and-such a place, I strictly adhere to the ritual protocols and widely initiate the offering of incense and cultivation. I establish the altar and reverently invoke the true ranks of the deities, hoping that your blessings may flow abundantly and that lasting peace and security may be preserved.\n\nWe humbly pray that the Supreme Saints may turn their radiant light toward us and that the divine immortals may deign to witness our sincerity. May your swift chariots briefly descend to observe the purity of our hearts. We are filled with earnest entreaty and steadfast in our devotion. The words of this disciple of the Most High are now respectfully presented.\n\nNext, the Orthodox Unity Dharma Master ascends to recite the petition.\nThe words of the disciple of the Most High have been respectfully submitted; we await your gracious reception and favorable response. May you bestow your boundless compassion and grant us immeasurable blessings.\n\nWe have heard that the Three Clarities roam in mystery, and the myriad saints are revered in their loftiness. They cannot be sought through sight or sound, nor can they be described in words. Today, this disciple of the Most High reverently serves the Supreme Heaven and takes refuge in the Great Dao. He embodies the esoteric teachings of the true canon and cultivates himself according to the profound Dharma. Yet, fearing the transgressions of past lives may incur hidden retribution, he now strictly adheres to the ritual protocols and grandly inaugurates this offering. He welcomes the lofty perfected of the Three Realms and invites the august saints of the Nine Heavens. With reverence, he presents purified offerings, hoping for the descent of the divine immortals.\n\nWe humbly pray that the mind of the Dao may remain pure and undivided, and that worldly entanglements may dissolve. May this ephemeral body be preserved, and the teachings of self-cultivation be fulfilled. Thereafter, may we attain longevity and enduring vision, completing our practice and perfecting our merit. May the grace extend to both the living and the deceased, and may blessings forever secure the protection of our masters.\n\nThis minister and the disciples of the Most High, with utmost urgency and devotion, bow twice in earnest supplication.\n\nNext, incense is offered.\nWine is presented.\nNext, the officiant sounds the chime and performs the secondary offering.\nNext, the officiant sounds the chime and intones the *Hymn of the Great Immortal Learners*:\nTo learn immortality is to renounce worldly splendor; each thought accumulates upon the last.\nComing and going disturb my spirit; its restlessness prevents attainment.\nExtinguishing thoughts, I rest in tranquil emptiness; in solitude, I enter profound stillness.\nI seek the scriptures as if parched with thirst, holding fast to my resolve like unyielding metal or stone.\nMay you safeguard the path to immortality for your disciple; may the Five Numinous Ones transmit the registers of transcendence.\n\nThis minister respectfully and earnestly addresses the following:\nThe Imperial Throne of the Northern Culmen, the August Lords of the Sun and Moon, the venerable stars of the Five Planets and Four Luminaries, the Great Saints of the Northern Dipper and Southern Culmen, the Three Officials and their sovereigns, the True Lords of the Five Thearchs, the stellar deities of the Twenty-Eight Lodges, the host of saints of the Heavenly Pivot Institute, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, the Three Heavens’ Great Dharma Masters, the Three Masters of the Numinous Treasure Scriptures and Registers, the host of saints of the Northern Culmen Demon-Dispelling Institute, and all the divine beings and celestial configurations of the Vault of Heaven.\n\nWe humbly acknowledge that the Prime Minister of the Pure Capital spreads the work of the mysterious transformation, and the great deities of the Purple Palace assist with impartial virtue. They emerge with the seasons and embody all things with benevolence. We bow our heads in reverence to present our plea, hoping for your compassionate regard.\n\nThis disciple of the Most High, having early taken refuge in the true teachings, is unworthily called to serve as an officiant. His aspiration lies in cultivation and his heart in benefiting others. He promotes the ritual protocols and bears the numinous talismans, reverently following the benevolence of the Supreme Thearch to universally relieve the suffering of the people. Therefore, he solemnly arranges the jade altar and invites the descent of the cloud chariots. He hopes for your gracious favor to widely bless all beings, both animate and inanimate.\n\nWe humbly pray that the mind of the Dao may remain steadfast and upright, and that the power of the Dharma may flourish. May the true qi be preserved within this body, and the transgressions of past kalpas be dissolved. May merit extend to our masters and grace encompass all living beings. We look upward, hoping for your illuminating gaze to fulfill our prayers.\n\nThis minister and the disciples of the Most High, with utmost urgency and devotion, bow twice in earnest supplication.\n\nNext, incense is offered thrice.\nWine is presented.\nBroth is offered.\nNext, the officiant sounds the chime and performs the tertiary offering.\nNext, the officiant sounds the chime and intones the *Processional Hymn of Departure from the Hall*:\nThe Dao prioritizes purification; through diligent practice, one ascends to the Golden Towers.\nThus, the great Dharma bridge is established to universally deliver all beings.\nRepaying the kindness of past lives, the mind of the Dao arises transcendent.\nThe body ascends to the immortal capital; seven generations of ancestors are all liberated.\n\nThis minister respectfully and earnestly addresses the following:\nThe August Lords of the Five Marchmounts, the Dragon Deities of the Four Seas, the sacred peaks and grotto-heavens, the tranquil hermitages and blessed lands, the Ten Continents and Three Isles, the Four Waterways and Hundred Rivers, the immortal officials of the administrative offices, the Great Saints of Ascension, the celestial bureaucrats and their subordinates, the deities of the earthly realms, the immortal functionaries and divine generals, the officials of the registers and numinous officers, the sovereigns of the netherworld, the deities of water and land, the numinous powers of the Three Realms, and the supreme saints of the Ten Directions.",

When summoned again, they shall arrive promptly as before.\n\nNext, the High Master of Rituals restores the incense burner:\nIncense officials, the Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, and all attending spirit officials—at this place where the jiao rites are held, may golden nectar, cinnabar-green mushrooms, and azure herbs spontaneously arise. May the hundred spirits and host of perfected ones gather here before this incense burner.\n\nWe pray that the disciples of the Most High and this minister, recipients of blessings, may be favored by the ten directions. May jade lads and immortal maidens attend the fragrant smoke, swiftly conveying the sincerity of our earlier prayers directly to the presence of the Utmost True, Boundless, and Great Dao—the August Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven.\n\nNext, the sounding of the chime signals the Hymn of China’s Splendor.\n\nNext, proceed to the site for burning the prayer texts and stand in order.\n\nNext, present incense, recite the offering words, pour the libation, and bow in retreat.\n\nNext, the sounding of the chime signals the Hymn of Dedication:\nAll the merit of the jiao rites performed is dedicated to the disciples of the Most High, this minister, and all who have participated, that together we may rely on this virtuous act to attain the supreme Dao and all who have offered reverence.\n\nNext, the High Master of Rituals recites the Dedication of Merit:\nOn behalf of the disciple of the Most High, [Name], who seeks grace, repents transgressions, accumulates blessings, and dispels calamities, we invoke:\nThe Great Sage, Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning;\nThe Boundless Great Dao, Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Treasure;\nThe Most High Lord Lao;\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Purple Clarity Who Bestows Blessings;\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Prolongs Life and Augments Destiny;\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Preserves Life and Protects Destiny;\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Eight Trigrams Who Guards the Body;\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Nine Palaces Who Defends Against Misfortune;\nThe Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions’ Numinous Treasure;\nThe Great Compassionate Perfected of the Solar Canopy;\nThe Great Merciful Perfected of the Lunar Stillness;\nThe Perfected of Southern Prosperity Who Extends Longevity;\nThe Perfected of the Three Pure Ones’ Jade Treasury;\nAnd all the immortals and sages of Jade Capital Mountain—whose merits are beyond conception.\n\nNext, the sounding of the chime signals the conclusion of the rites and the disciples’ withdrawal from their positions.\n\nThe altar for cultivating the true Dao in accordance with the Orthodox Heart of Heaven’s Dharma has now completed its jiao rites.",
