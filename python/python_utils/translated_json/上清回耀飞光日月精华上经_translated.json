  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Clarity Scripture of Revolving Radiance and Flying Light: Essence of the Sun and Moon**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Clarity Scripture of Revolving Radiance and Flying Light: Essence of the Sun and Moon*. Author unknown, likely composed during the Northern and Southern Dynasties or the Sui-Tang period. Contains several hymns of praise. One scroll. Base text from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, Proper Section I.\n\n---\n\n**The Supreme Clarity Scripture of Revolving Radiance and Flying Light: Essence of the Sun and Moon**\n\nGreat is the Seven Treasures Palace,\nNaturally born of the lotus blossom.\nResplendent, it unfolds the night’s brilliance,\nIn the dim and distant, the radiance of the divine abode.\n\nGazing upward at the Dark Truth Terrace,\nCloud towers rise in towering majesty.\nFlowing splendor illumines the dark void,\nIts martial might subdues the ten thousand demons.\nIt plucks the suffering from the depths of sin and tribulation,\nAccumulating the fragrant jade of the Infant.\nThrough chanting and praise, the seven ancestors are delivered,\nVirtue and fortune harmonize in their wake.\n\nSupremely wondrous, the divine radiance emerges,\nFormless, still, and without shadow.\nBeyond all bounds, transcending all limits,\nVast and open, it universally saves all beings.\nLifting the seven mysteries from their bitter toil,\nIn boundless emptiness, profound and enduring stillness.\nIt ferries across the five rivers of suffering,\nResponding to karmic resonance, ascending upon the clouds.\nThe Lamp King pervades the ten directions,\nIn the unseen, nothing remains unillumined.\n\nResplendent is the Dark Truth Terrace,\nIts brilliance shining across the ten directions.\nIn the desolate cold passes, bonds are released,\nThe multitudes in peril secretly pass through.\nThe seven ancestors and the three paths are freed,\nNo longer dwelling in sorrow and affliction.\nI bow my head to the Lamp King,\nDelivering names to the Eastern Flower Palace.\nI am the helmsman of the sea vessel,\nThus able to ferry the three returns.\n\nThe night’s light penetrates the hidden valleys,\nBody and mind cleansed, barriers dissolved.\nMisty vapors scatter to the eight extremities,\nBright illumination enters the Great Subtlety.\nRevering and reciting the supreme teaching,\nHow towering is the fortune and blessing!\n\nSwift winds weave through the falling void,\nSilence fills the eight mounds.\nThe Three Primes generate shadowy clouds,\nTheir empty radiance illuminating the Great Nothingness.\nGazing through the ten directions,\nCarefree, the sorrows and worries disperse.\nThe flying wheel hovers in the vast heavens,\nFormless, traceless.\nFootsteps vanish as the flying wheel turns,\nWhispering into the profound stillness.\n\nDonning the coarse robe, I chant the night’s light,\nThe myriad heavens descend to bestow their grace.\nSin and fortune arise not from fixed origins,\nNear or far, they depend on the self.\nIf merit is not amassed in abundance,\nMorning and evening, cultivate the field of fortune.\nI take refuge in the Dao of Non-Action,\nUltimately embodying the Perfect Truth.\n\nResplendent and radiant, the light shines,\nBright and clear, no hidden corner remains.\nIts brilliance transcends the darkest beyond,\nFortune descends, misfortune departs.\nIn orderly sequence, I observe the ten directions,\nUniversally saving all beings.\nI adorn my Dark Truth reins,\nHand in hand, we grasp the jade tally.\nThe bright lamp strikes the jade bell,\nIts resonance already enters the formless.\nA single gaze pierces the Three Treasures,\nReleasing me from the accumulated darkness of past lives.\n\nI linger in the Seven Treasures Palace,\nThe wheel turns through the winding mountain valleys.\nResting beneath the canopy of karmic affinity,\nWho knows how many years have passed?\nMy mouth rinses with the essence of golden fluid,\nThe cedar’s age begins with the Infant’s blossom.\nThose below vie in worldly glory,\nUnaware, what can be done?\n\nThe dark radiance reflects the winding valleys,\nBright and clear, it penetrates the abyssal springs.\nIts flowing light intertwines in luminous splendor,\nEncircling the Jade Capital Mountain.\nThe seven ancestors return to womb-born life,\nAscending beyond all intervals.\nLush and dense, it hovers in the empty void,\nVigorously entering the Great Clarity.\n\nHeavenly hounds flank left and right,\nThe wheel turns, inclining toward the south.\nBeyond the nine years of trance,\nA fleeting awakening, yet the spirit remains unopened.\nThe seven ancestors attain womb immortality,\nIn the Southern Palace, they are reborn anew.\nThe flying wheel hovers in the empty cavern,\nGazing down a thousand, ten thousand fathoms.\n\nThrough understanding, all perceptions align,\nThe five mists inhale and scatter.\nThe body, light and free from action,\nThe fourfold clarity responds to the scene’s judgment.\nThe hells and the three evil paths,\nAll escape the cage of tribulation.\nWhistling and singing on the Nine Mysteries Terrace,\nBy the cliffs, rinsing in the rushing rapids.\n\nThe mind awakens, the six senses flow freely,\nDaily casting off the dust and defilement.\nRosy clouds illuminate the golden chamber,\nThe empty hall disperses the dark fragrance.\nThrough refined resonance, the numinous descends,\nThough the form is solitary, the Dao is also divided.\nGlancing in an instant across ten thousand kalpas,\nWho perceives the passing of a hundred cedars?\n\nThe flourishing garden adorns the divine steps,\nCrimson jade radiates in the purple court.\nThe flowing wind stirs the empty cavern,\nJade horns veil the void with their song.\nPurple mists coil through the winding chambers,\nCinnabar radiance encircles the green carriage.\nFlying essence thickens the dark canopy,\nFeathered standards gleam in the Great Clarity.\n\nThe limpid scene extends to the ninefold boundaries,\nRoaming and soaring through the wind city.\nRevolving above the five sacred peaks,\nI rein my steed along the ramparts of the city walls.\nGazing upward at the Dark Truth Gate,\nCloud towers rise in towering majesty.\nFragrance winds through the palace halls,\nBright lamps praise the numinous hymns.\n\nThe sun and moon shine upon my neck,\nI take refuge in the Scripture of the Lamp King.\nVast and open, it pierces the eight extremities,\nFrom this, the lotus blossoms arise.\nThe Dragon King holds the sea’s waters,\nThus able to rinse the fragrant vase.\nThe Brahmin receives this hymn,\nThereby ascending to heavenly birth.\nThe human king receives this scripture,\nHis lifespan equal to ten thousand myriad ages.\nFortune extends to the seven ancestors,\nNo longer bound in sorrow and affliction.\nFuture lives bear immeasurable causes,\nGeneration after generation, revering the worthy and true.\n\n---\n\n**Three Separate Hymns**\n\n**Song of the Purple Prime Lady of the Southern Culmen**\n\nDark waves stir the blue-green tides,\nVast currents surge through the ten thousand streams.\nI ride the light, gazing through the six voids,\nLonging to wander with the perfected ones.\nYet the wondrous song finds no response in me,\nTo whom can this pure sound be offered?\nAmid the clouds, I urge the jade wheel,\nWho could be my companion in the dust?\n\nWhite clouds merge with the numinous scene,\nDense and lush, entering the Great Subtlety.\nGreen reins gather the feathered wheels,\nThe emerald canopy follows the wind’s return.\nGolden gates open the jade chambers,\nThe wind terrace and jade towers stand in array.\nThey welcome me to the Dragon Chariot’s hall,\nAscending the steps of the Void Sovereign.\n\nThough the body cycles through worldly transformations,\nThe soul and spirit never perish for a moment.\nThe fortune of past lives accumulates profound karma,\nFormer vows now fulfilled in this present.\nWondrous is the wisdom of emptiness,\nThe perfected one, embodying truth, emerges.\nHeavenly dragons lave at the fragrant ford,\nWashing and refining my womb-born form.\n\nTo whom can these wondrous words be entrusted?\nThe numinous summons of the dark calling is complete.\nThe heart of the Dao transcends the three realms,\nMerging to manifest the primordial unity.\nAlone, I awaken to the formless,\nRoaming freely in the great vehicle’s ease.\n\n**Thus concludes *The Supreme Clarity Scripture of Revolving Radiance and Flying Light: Essence of the Sun and Moon*.**",
