  "full_translation": "**Title: Treatise on the Golden Essence (Jīnjīng Lùn)**\n*Scripture Name: Treatise on the Golden Essence.*\n*Attributed Author: Unknown; likely from the Tang Dynasty.*\n*Volume: One scroll.*\n*Source of the Base Text: *Zhèngtǒng Dàozàng* (Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era), in the *Dòngzhēn Bù* (Section on Mysterious Perfection), under the *Fāngfǎ Lèi* (Category of Methods).\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Treatise on the Golden Essence (Jīnjīng Lùn Xù)**\n\nThe Golden Essence is the foundation of creation, the Dao of the Void, the manifestation of emptiness within discourse on emptiness, and the principle governing heaven and earth. It is both empty and yet present, both colored and yet empty—knowing emptiness while not being empty, knowing color while not being colored. Its essence is initially dim and indistinct, yet its radiance is named as the wondrous sound.\n\nGold is the pure *qi* of the moon’s luminosity;\nThe Essence is the true crystal of the sun’s brilliance.\nThus, the sun’s *qi* generates one, which divides into the two *yī* (polarities),\nAnd when the two polarities are complete, the Three Talents stand—\nHeaven, Earth, and Man.\n\nHence, the heavens are round while the earth is square,\nThe clear *qi* forms heaven, the turbid *qi* forms earth,\nAnd man is the harmonious *qi* of the central balance—\nHolding the essence in vague wonder,\nBeing the substance within the void,\nAnd arising from emptiness as form.\n\nMan dwells in the transient world.\nOne must know the nature of illusion and transformation,\nAs the *Yīnfú Jīng* (Scripture of the Hidden Symbol) states:\n*\"The living are the roots of the dead; the dead are the wood of the living.\"*\nI fear that those who cultivate the Dao\nDo not grasp sacred truth,\nStruggle to penetrate the gates of the rare and sublime,\nFail to comprehend its words,\nAnd recklessly contrive their own interpretations,\nNever attaining the path of refinement,\nLost in futile pursuits,\nWasting their efforts in vain.\n\nMoreover, to refine the Dao,\nOne must understand the true principles of the Five Phases and Yin-Yang.\nSeize the Golden Essence,\nAnd it becomes the treasure-pillar of heaven and earth—\nOnly when the Five Peaks crumble will its decline be seen.\n\nI worry that later disciples, aspiring to transcendence,\nDo not awaken to the true teaching,\nAnd retreat midway,\nFalling into the depths of suffering,\nNever escaping the river of desire,\nAnd sinking into the sea of misery.\n\nThus, I expound the *Treatise on the Golden Essence* in three sections,\nTo spread it in the transient world,\nAnd guide those who refine the Dao,\nTo reveal its true principles,\nTo seize the power of creation,\nAnd attain the wondrous Way.\nDivided into three parts: Upper, Middle, and Lower.\n\nIf there are resolute scholars,\nWho transmit this treatise,\nThey must solemnly swear,\nKneeling and burning incense,\nOffering ten *liǎng* (two-tenths of a *catty*) of gold,\nThen may they pass it on.\n\nIf they encounter unworthy disciples,\nThey must not transmit it—\nThis is the celestial secret.\nHurry and do not pass it lightly,\nLest the celestial secret be revealed.\n\nIf transmitted to the right person,\nIt is called *\"degree bestowed in the Southern Palace\"* (Nángōng),\nAscending to heaven in broad daylight.\n\nIf not transmitted to the right person,\nThe calamity falls upon the seven ancestors.\nIf indiscriminately transmitted,\nThe calamity falls upon the nine ancestors,\nForever sinking into the abyss,\nDrowning in the sea of suffering,\nAnd becoming a lowly ghost.\n\nEven if one attains a human body,\nIt will surely be one of poverty and lowliness,\nNever whole or complete.\n\nThus, the *Treatise on the Golden Essence* is placed here—\nTo awaken understanding and guide refinement,\nSo that one’s body may transcend into sainthood,\nAnd their essence may be clothed in immortal raiment,\nDrinking the nectar of jade,\nFeasting on celestial food.\n\nThis text merely outlines the broad principles,\nHence its preface is written,\nTo make clear the profound treatise,\nAnd examine its detailed intent.\n\n---\n\n**Treatise on the Golden Essence: Upper Section (Jīnjīng Lùn Shàng Piān)**\n\nThe Golden Essence, in matter, is Yang—\nIts hue contains white, and it is named *hóng* (mercury).\n*Hóng* is quicksilver, not the common quicksilver of the world.\nAccording to the Five Phases, it belongs to the West,\nCalled *gēngxīn* (Geng and Xin) as the Heavenly Stems,\nCalled *shēnyǒu* (Shen and You) as the Earthly Branches,\nBorn from its soil, dying in fire,\nAble to subdue wood and manifest water,\nAnd transform into *qiān* (lead),\nThen return.\n\nWater is the child of gold;\nGold is the mother of water.\nAs they exchange their *qi*,\nThey are called *hóng* (mercury).\n*Hóng* is neither clear when settled nor turbid when stirred—\nOnly when refined by fire does it become silver,\nAnd then it transforms into gold.\n\nGold is called the Tiger,\nNot the Tiger of the mundane world.\nThe *Yì* (Classic of Changes) says:\n*\"Treading on frost, one encounters solid ice.\"*\nIce is quicksilver, differently named as *hóng* (mercury).\nThe *Yīnfú Jīng Sòng* (Commentary on the Scripture of the Hidden Symbol) states:\n*\"Seizing mercury, one refines the elixir, and lives as a mortal.\"*\n\nMercury is the Essence, hence it is called *Tàiyáng Jīng* (Essence of the Great Sun).\nThus, the Essence of Yin-Yang descends from fire into the *Dāntián* (elixir field).\nThe *Dāntián* is Earth, where Earth generates gold—\nThis is called the Golden Essence.\n\nThe Golden Essence is the root of man,\nThe pure *qi* of the lower *yuán* (origin),\nAlso called *Chàinǚ* (the Astonished Maiden),\nOr *Jīnyè* (Golden Fluid),\nOr *Huándān* (Returning Elixir),\nOr *Yùyè* (Jade Fluid).\n\nThe celestial transformation of the Five Fluids’ essential secret,\nThe Dao’s summation of the thousand transformations’ key words—\nThus, in the worldly kalpa (age),\nIf one seeks to harm themselves,\nThe complete method risks revealing the celestial Dao,\nAnd lightly spilling it upon mortals,\nLeaving no trace behind.\n\nOnly when the Golden Essence undergoes nine transformations,\nAnd the elixir returns crimson,\nWill one nourish life and benefit their family—\nNo other path surpasses this!\n\n---\n\n**Treatise on the Golden Essence: Middle Section (Jīnjīng Lùn Zhōng Piān)**\n\nThe Golden Essence is the principle of lead and mercury.\nHeaven and Earth’s creation:\nHeaven obtains the Essence and becomes one—*able to move*;\nEarth obtains the Essence and becomes one—*able to remain still*;\nMan obtains the Essence and becomes one—*all affairs are accomplished*.\nHeaven obtains the Essence and becomes spirit;\nEarth obtains the Essence and becomes luminous;\nMan obtains the Essence and becomes *qíngxìng* (emotions and nature).\n\n*Qíngxìng* is the root of man,\nThe gateway to life and death.\nIf one seeks life,\nThey must seek the guardian of the life-gate at the life-gate itself—\nThis is the calculation for longevity.\n\nThe Golden Essence is lead and mercury,\nWhich, when obtained, naturally merge.\nThe Dragon and Tiger capture and release each other,\nAnd the Golden Essence forms.\n\nThe Dragon and Tiger are the Five Phases of gold and wood—\nGold is the Tiger, wood is the Dragon.\nThe Tiger is named *hóng* (mercury), the gold-water;\nThe Dragon is *qiān* (lead), wood-fire.\nThe Dragon and Tiger are *yìngmìng* (life and death),\nLead and mercury are the Yin-Yang husband and wife.\n\nLead is the infant,\nMercury is the maiden—\nBoth originate from one source,\nYet ultimately bear different names.\nOne is black, the other white,\nBut their true nature is the same.\n\nNow, the world seeks the Tiger in *gēngxīn* (Geng and Xin),\nAnd searches for the Dragon in *jiǎyǐ* (Jia and Yi),\nYet they do not know that both are within the body itself.\nThe Dragon resides in *gēngxīn* (Geng and Xin),\nThe Tiger dwells in *jiǎyǐ* (Jia and Yi),\nFire is used in *rénzǐ* (Ren and Zi),\nAnd it abides in *bīngdīng* (Bing and Ding).\n\nThe sages of old did not directly record their methods,\nLeaving later scholars and aspirants bewildered—\nThey vainly conjectured, wasted their efforts,\nAnd spent their lives in vain pursuit,\nOnly to grow decrepit, achieving nothing,\nYet destroyed the true path and spawned false doctrines.\n\nIf I do not leave traces behind,\nThe path to immortality may be lost forever.\nThus, I record these words,\nSo that future seekers may follow the pattern.\n\nIt is said: The Dragon is born wrapped in fire,\nThe Tiger emerges from water.\n\nAgain, it is said:\nThe Dragon is not bound in *shùmíng* (束瞑),\nThe Tiger is not found in the Western lands.\n\n---\n\n**Gold-Crystal Theory (Lower Section)**\n\nHeaven is clear, Earth is turbid;\nHeaven is Yang, Earth is Yin;\nHeaven is Father, Earth is Mother.\n\nHeaven is *yīqì* (one *qi*),\nEarth is *èryí* (two *yì*),\nMan is *sāncái* (three *cái*)—\nThis is the Yellow, Black, and White.\n\nYellow is Earth,\nBlack is Water,\nWhite is Metal.\nWhen Earth, Water, and Metal unite,\nThey are called *jīnjīng* (Gold-Crystal).\n\n*Jīnjīng* belongs to *qián* (乾, Heaven),\nWhere Metal is the Father,\nAnd to *kūn* (坤, Earth),\nWhere Metal is the Mother.\n\nMetal is born from Earth,\nWater from Metal.\nThe Earth’s pure *qi* ascends to Heaven,\nYin and Yang interact,\nAnd thus *jīnjīng* is formed.\n\n*Jīnjīng* ascends to the *Lí* Palace (sepal),\nThen passes into the *Huá* Pool (bladder),\nBecoming *jīnyè* (津液, vital fluids),\nDescending to the *Dāntián* (elixir field),\nAnd becomes *gōng* (mercury).\n\n*Gōng* is blood,\nBlood enters the bones as marrow,\nLike oil exhausted, the lamp goes out—\nWhen marrow is spent, life ends.\n\nThus it is said:\nTo seek immortality, replenish the *jīnjīng* and nourish the brain;\nTo strengthen the body, refine the fluids and store them in the *Míngtáng* (bright hall).\n\nWhen the fluids fill the *jīnjīng*,\nLife and essence endure.\n\nThe *Míngtáng* is the inner chamber of the body,\nWith a sealed and solemn *dòngfáng* (inner sanctum),\nWhere the maiden (*lǎonǚ*, lead) is paired with the golden youth (*jīnláng*, mercury).\n\nThe golden youth is lead,\nLead is the infant,\nWhen *jīnjīng* is full and the fluids flow,\nThey enter the *wěiwèn* (尾问, tail gate),\nCarried by the *Héchē* (river vehicle) into the *shèntáng* (kidney chamber).\n\nThe *shèntáng* is the root of life and essence,\nThe origin of humanity,\nWithin which lie two orifices—\nThe left is *Tiānguān* (Heaven’s Gate),\nThe right is *Dìhù* (Earth’s Door).\nWhen *jīnjīng* is firmly secured,\nDo not let it scatter—\nThus prolonging life and strengthening essence.\n\nIt may be used on *chǒuwèi* (丑未) days and hours,\nDrawing *yùn* (circulation) to the *níwán* (泥丸, brain),\nCalled *bǔnǎo* (supplementing the brain).\nIf on *yínshēn* (寅申) days,\nCapture the *jīnjīng* and refine it with fire,\nNaturally forming the elixir—\nCalled *qīfǎn língshā* (seven-returned soul sand).\n\nFrequently observe the fire’s intensity,\nAlways capturing the *jīnjīng*,\nIt will naturally become the Great Medicine.\n\nThe body transcends to sainthood,\nDetaching from the mundane—\nLike the Dragon shedding its bones,\nWherever the mind intends,\nInstantly it arrives.\n\nThe body wanders the Five Lakes,\nThe Ten Isles and Two Isles,\nRiding the clouds in freedom.\n\nI fear those who do not understand these words,\nSo I further expound the *Jīndān Dàyào* (Great Golden Elixir),\nThe *Jīnjīng Lǐan Gǒng* (True and False Dragon-Tiger),\nIn eleven songs—\nExamine and practice them.\n\n**Song One:**\nTo refine *jīnjīng* into cinnabar,\nEnclose it in the crucible with golden flowers,\nThe vulgar do not believe in the secret of longevity—\nThough the nine transformations are complete, do not boast.\n\n**Song Two:**\nThe divine elixir is said to have many methods,\nYet sparrows cannot give birth to phoenixes.\nOnly true lead and true mercury suffice—\nAll else fails the alchemical test.\n\n**Song Three:**\nThe Dragon of *jiǎyǐ* (甲乙) emerges from *Lí* (sepal),\nThe Tiger of *gēngxīn* (庚辛) is born from *Kǎn* (abyss).\nAs husband and wife, they harmonize,\nUnchanged from their original nature and emotion.\n\n**Song Four:**\nThe sage’s words praise the yellow sprout,\nWhere Metal and Water generate in one crucible.\nBranches transform into Dragon and Tiger,\n*Kǎn* and *Lí* unite in the *Zǐhé Chē* (purple river vehicle).\n\n**Song Five:**\nBefore *Kǎn* (male) and *Lí* (female) unite,\nThey are paired by Heaven as the two *yì* (principles).\nOnce they become husband and wife,\nThey are named *Shèngwúzhī* (the Unknowable Sage).\n\n**Song Six:**\nEverywhere hides the Dragon and Tiger in symbols,\nEverywhere *Kǎn* and *Lí* are obscured.\nFrom ancient times, none have recognized them—\nHow could the sages deceive *Xīqí* (希夷)?\n\n**Song Seven:**\nWithin the furnace, nine refinements reveal *jīnjīng*,\nRed frost flakes like powder—light as down.\nA hundred *hú* of pearls cannot compare in worth,\nFor it is the path to celestial realms.\n\n**Song Eight:**\nTake one grain and crush it to dust,\nSlowly draw mercury over the fire.\nWho covets a hall filled with pearls and jade?\nDetaching from the mundane makes one a true immortal.\n\n**Song Nine:**\nMeeting and speaking vaguely—\nWho among them grasps the truth?\nMere combinations of Four Yellows and Eight Stones—\nHow could they know the White Tiger and Dragon are kin?\n\n**Song Ten:**\nOn *rényín* (壬寅) days, extract the golden Tiger from water,\nOn *wùjǐ* (戊己) days, refine the wooden Dragon in the furnace.\nIt relies on the *Zhūquè* (朱雀, Vermilion Bird)’s power in the South,\nDiligently guarding the *Chìtóng Gōng* (赤彤宫, Crimson Palace).\n\n**Song Eleven:**\nThe male and female meet in the center,\nAt twenty-eight years of age, their essence aligns.\nThe General must introduce them,\nAnd the Golden Official must bind them in marriage.\n\nThe *Gold-Crystal Theory* concludes.",

      "translated_text": "The sages of old did not directly record their methods,\nLeaving later scholars and aspirants bewildered—\nThey vainly conjectured, wasted their efforts,\nAnd spent their lives in vain pursuit,\nOnly to grow decrepit, achieving nothing,\nYet destroyed the true path and spawned false doctrines.\n\nIf I do not leave traces behind,\nThe path to immortality may be lost forever.\nThus, I record these words,\nSo that future seekers may follow the pattern.\n\nIt is said: The Dragon is born wrapped in fire,\nThe Tiger emerges from water.\n\nAgain, it is said:\nThe Dragon is not bound in *shùmíng* (束瞑),\nThe Tiger is not found in the Western lands.\n\n---\n\n**Gold-Crystal Theory (Lower Section)**\n\nHeaven is clear, Earth is turbid;\nHeaven is Yang, Earth is Yin;\nHeaven is Father, Earth is Mother.\n\nHeaven is *yīqì* (one *qi*),\nEarth is *èryí* (two *yì*),\nMan is *sāncái* (three *cái*)—\nThis is the Yellow, Black, and White.\n\nYellow is Earth,\nBlack is Water,\nWhite is Metal.\nWhen Earth, Water, and Metal unite,\nThey are called *jīnjīng* (Gold-Crystal).\n\n*Jīnjīng* belongs to *qián* (乾, Heaven),\nWhere Metal is the Father,\nAnd to *kūn* (坤, Earth),\nWhere Metal is the Mother.\n\nMetal is born from Earth,\nWater from Metal.\nThe Earth’s pure *qi* ascends to Heaven,\nYin and Yang interact,\nAnd thus *jīnjīng* is formed.\n\n*Jīnjīng* ascends to the *Lí* Palace (sepal),\nThen passes into the *Huá* Pool (bladder),\nBecoming *jīnyè* (津液, vital fluids),\nDescending to the *Dāntián* (elixir field),\nAnd becomes *gōng* (mercury).\n\n*Gōng* is blood,\nBlood enters the bones as marrow,\nLike oil exhausted, the lamp goes out—\nWhen marrow is spent, life ends.\n\nThus it is said:\nTo seek immortality, replenish the *jīnjīng* and nourish the brain;\nTo strengthen the body, refine the fluids and store them in the *Míngtáng* (bright hall).\n\nWhen the fluids fill the *jīnjīng*,\nLife and essence endure.\n\nThe *Míngtáng* is the inner chamber of the body,\nWith a sealed and solemn *dòngfáng* (inner sanctum),\nWhere the maiden (*lǎonǚ*, lead) is paired with the golden youth (*jīnláng*, mercury).\n\nThe golden youth is lead,\nLead is the infant,\nWhen *jīnjīng* is full and the fluids flow,\nThey enter the *wěiwèn* (尾问, tail gate),\nCarried by the *Héchē* (river vehicle) into the *shèntáng* (kidney chamber).\n\nThe *shèntáng* is the root of life and essence,\nThe origin of humanity,\nWithin which lie two orifices—\nThe left is *Tiānguān* (Heaven’s Gate),\nThe right is *Dìhù* (Earth’s Door).\nWhen *jīnjīng* is firmly secured,\nDo not let it scatter—\nThus prolonging life and strengthening essence.\n\nIt may be used on *chǒuwèi* (丑未) days and hours,\nDrawing *yùn* (circulation) to the *níwán* (泥丸, brain),\nCalled *bǔnǎo* (supplementing the brain).\nIf on *yínshēn* (寅申) days,\nCapture the *jīnjīng* and refine it with fire,\nNaturally forming the elixir—\nCalled *qīfǎn língshā* (seven-returned soul sand).\n\nFrequently observe the fire’s intensity,\nAlways capturing the *jīnjīng*,\nIt will naturally become the Great Medicine.\n\nThe body transcends to sainthood,\nDetaching from the mundane—\nLike the Dragon shedding its bones,\nWherever the mind intends,\nInstantly it arrives.\n\nThe body wanders the Five Lakes,\nThe Ten Isles and Two Isles,\nRiding the clouds in freedom.\n\nI fear those who do not understand these words,\nSo I further expound the *Jīndān Dàyào* (Great Golden Elixir),\nThe *Jīnjīng Lǐan Gǒng* (True and False Dragon-Tiger),\nIn eleven songs—\nExamine and practice them.\n\n**Song One:**\nTo refine *jīnjīng* into cinnabar,\nEnclose it in the crucible with golden flowers,\nThe vulgar do not believe in the secret of longevity—\nThough the nine transformations are complete, do not boast.\n\n**Song Two:**\nThe divine elixir is said to have many methods,\nYet sparrows cannot give birth to phoenixes.\nOnly true lead and true mercury suffice—\nAll else fails the alchemical test.\n\n**Song Three:**\nThe Dragon of *jiǎyǐ* (甲乙) emerges from *Lí* (sepal),\nThe Tiger of *gēngxīn* (庚辛) is born from *Kǎn* (abyss).\nAs husband and wife, they harmonize,\nUnchanged from their original nature and emotion.\n\n**Song Four:**\nThe sage’s words praise the yellow sprout,\nWhere Metal and Water generate in one crucible.\nBranches transform into Dragon and Tiger,\n*Kǎn* and *Lí* unite in the *Zǐhé Chē* (purple river vehicle).\n\n**Song Five:**\nBefore *Kǎn* (male) and *Lí* (female) unite,\nThey are paired by Heaven as the two *yì* (principles).\nOnce they become husband and wife,\nThey are named *Shèngwúzhī* (the Unknowable Sage).\n\n**Song Six:**\nEverywhere hides the Dragon and Tiger in symbols,\nEverywhere *Kǎn* and *Lí* are obscured.\nFrom ancient times, none have recognized them—\nHow could the sages deceive *Xīqí* (希夷)?\n\n**Song Seven:**\nWithin the furnace, nine refinements reveal *jīnjīng*,\nRed frost flakes like powder—light as down.\nA hundred *hú* of pearls cannot compare in worth,\nFor it is the path to celestial realms.\n\n**Song Eight:**\nTake one grain and crush it to dust,\nSlowly draw mercury over the fire.\nWho covets a hall filled with pearls and jade?\nDetaching from the mundane makes one a true immortal.\n\n**Song Nine:**\nMeeting and speaking vaguely—\nWho among them grasps the truth?\nMere combinations of Four Yellows and Eight Stones—\nHow could they know the White Tiger and Dragon are kin?\n\n**Song Ten:**\nOn *rényín* (壬寅) days, extract the golden Tiger from water,\nOn *wùjǐ* (戊己) days, refine the wooden Dragon in the furnace.\nIt relies on the *Zhūquè* (朱雀, Vermilion Bird)’s power in the South,\nDiligently guarding the *Chìtóng Gōng* (赤彤宫, Crimson Palace).\n\n**Song Eleven:**\nThe male and female meet in the center,\nAt twenty-eight years of age, their essence aligns.\nThe General must introduce them,\nAnd the Golden Official must bind them in marriage.\n\nThe *Gold-Crystal Theory* concludes.",
      "overlap_context": "cury is the maiden—\nBoth originate from one source,\nYet ultimately bear different names.\nOne is black, the other white,\nBut their true nature is the same.\n\nNow, the world seeks the Tiger in *gēngxīn* (Geng and Xin),\nAnd searches for the Dragon in *jiǎyǐ* (Jia and Yi),\nYet they do not know that both are within the body itself.\nThe Dragon resides in *gēngxīn* (Geng and Xin),\nThe Tiger dwells in *jiǎyǐ* (Jia and Yi),\nFire is used in *rénzǐ* (Ren and Zi),\nAnd it abides in *bīngdīng* (Bing and Ding).",
