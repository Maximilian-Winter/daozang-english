Also known as *The Writ of Interlacing Girdles*, derived from *The Scripture of the Grand Ultimate’s Interlacing Girdles*. Author unknown, approximately dating to the Northern and Southern Dynasties. One fascicle. Base text from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, Proper Section, Part One.\n\nThe Method of the Supreme Clarity Lord of the Grand Tenuity for Knotting the Girdle of True Writ\nAlso called *The Writ of Interlacing Girdles*, transmitted from *The Scripture of the Grand Ultimate’s Interlacing Girdles*. Herein from the fourth section of the *Cavern of Perfection*, fascicle thirty-one, as recorded in Master Lu’s authentic version, with colors and numbers as follows.\n\nFor this method, the precept requires a thirty-day retreat, an offering of eight taels of gold, and nine pairs of jade pendants. According to this method, the Lord of the Grand Tenuity, while in pure retreat in the Jade Heaven, received it from the Most High Jade Emperor, dividing its numinous alliance among the Nine Portals, knotting the central girdle at the Gate of Heaven, and casting the pledge of faith into the Great Void. Proclaiming its mandate to the Nine Mysteries, it gathers the Five Numinosities within the Jade Script and summons the Ten Thousand Riders upon the Path of No Interval—also called the Writ of Interlocking Radiance.\n\nIts method begins with the nine talismans of the upper section, which are the unmanifested tokens of the Most High Jade Emperor within the Nine Cavities. They knot the essence of spontaneity, emerging from the womb of the Mysterious Mother, refined and crystallized into the jade embryo to transform into the talismans of the Nine Emperors. Written with yellow brush, faced north to ingest, they alter form and transfigure countenance, allowing one to behold the Lord of the Grand Tenuity, riding a canopy of flying rosy clouds and sporting in the Mysterious Capital.\n\nThe nine talismans of the middle section are the spontaneous chapters formed from the qi of the Nine Heavens’ pure congealment, passing through the Nine Mysteries’ Mother to give birth to the numinous writ. Written with a blue-green brush, faced north to ingest, they enable one to behold the Lord of the Grand Tenuity, soaring through the void and ascending to the Nine Heavens.\n\nThe five talismans of the lower section are the primordial undifferentiated essence of the Five Emperors, knotting the hollow luminosity within the Void to refine the Nine Mysteries’ Mother into the generated writ. Written with a vermilion brush, faced west to ingest, they manifest the five-colored essence-light, allowing one to soar through the void and ascend to the Grand Clarity.\n\nFor men, use white silk; for women, purple silk, making it nine inches wide and nine feet long, writing in sequence. The subsequent text states that seven generations of ancestors will bear responsibility, and ten thousand kalpas will not absolve them—all in accordance with the Most High’s Purple Silk Alliance Writ. This means following the decree of the Most High, having attained perfected personhood, and aligning with the Purple Silk Writ. Thus, its opening declares that it should be transmitted to those sagely successors who attain the Dao.\n\nHere ends *The Method of the Supreme Clarity Lord of the Grand Tenuity for Knotting the Girdle of True Writ*.",
