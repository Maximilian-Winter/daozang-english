Speech, whether good or evil, invites misfortune or fortune—all arising from the karma of the mouth. Those who have left the household life, whether Daoist priests or female Daoist adepts, when residing in chambers or abbeys and engaging in discourse with venerable masters of great virtue, must inquire and deliberate with deference. They should speak in gentle tones and with humility, heeding the words of their venerable masters. If their intent is not yet fulfilled or the Dao’s principles remain unclear, they ought to wait until the master has fully expressed their counsel before gradually resolving matters. They must not disrupt the assembly with personal biases or leave their words in disarray. Even if their inner disposition is not malicious, such conduct will invite external reproach. Whether minor or major matters, discord will arise: first, the inner assembly will slander them; second, the outer assembly will slander them.\n\nWhen among fellow practitioners of the Dao, whether peers of similar age or seniors addressing juniors, or juniors engaging with seniors, all discussions—whether concerning communal affairs or personal matters—must be conducted with a composed mind and measured speech, ensuring the principles are thoroughly expounded. They must not raise their voices or startle the inner and outer assemblies, nor disregard the respect due to masters, fellow Daoists, or laypersons, nor bring shame upon parents, siblings, or clan kin.\n\nWhether in chambers or among disciples, when speaking one’s mind or uttering words, all should revolve around proper matters, engaging in doctrinal inquiry and response. The wise should be consulted, and the ignorant should be instructed, so that wisdom may grow ever brighter while ignorance daily diminishes. Though one may speak all day, if it aligns with the Dao, no hardship will arise.\n\nWhen addressing outsiders, relatives of the six relations, or any men and women, if discussing inquiries about well-being, seasonal changes, or mundane affairs that cannot be avoided, one may do so. Beyond this, however, one must not engage in improper or frivolous speech. Though worldly folk may delight in such discourse, it is unsuited to those who have left the household life—beware of uttering it.\n\nA single word that brings great misfortune is deemed excessive speech of the highest degree. A single word that invites humiliation is excessive speech of the middle degree. A single word that leads to ruin is excessive speech of the lowest degree. The speech of ancient and modern sages and worthies, though their words and phrases fill the space between heaven and earth, was still deemed insufficient. The world took them as models and never wearied of their words. Thus, good words are never excessive, and evil words are never few.\n\nThe ancients, when about to speak, reflected deeply, and their words became scriptures, established as models for humanity. The foolish, however, speak recklessly, bringing calamity upon themselves, ultimately harming their own being—this is a grave admonition.\n\n**Chapter on Study and Recitation**\nThe Code states: In all Daoist studies, one must understand that listening, learning, and dedicating merit require an enlightened master. If the master is unenlightened, it will instead harm one’s wisdom of the Dao.\n\nWhether Daoist priests or female officials, those who dwell in the gate of the Dao and aspire to profound awakening must abandon seven kinds of attachments: first, attachment to companionship; second, attachment to wine and lust; third, attachment to fame and profit; fourth, attachment to frivolous play; fifth, attachment to arts and music; sixth, attachment to food and drink; seventh, attachment to cities and markets.\n\nHaving abandoned these attachments, one should cultivate four kinds of aspirations to encounter a master: first, the aspiration to meet an enlightened master, regardless of distance; second, the aspiration to meet an enlightened master, regardless of poverty or wealth; third, the aspiration to meet an enlightened master, regardless of affection or aversion; fourth, the aspiration to meet an enlightened master, regardless of nobility or humility.\n\nFrom the first thought to the second, and onward to many thoughts; from the first moment to the second, and onward to many moments, one must drive the body and mind as if starving or parched, inquiring into subtle truths. Through hearing, contemplation, practice, and realization, one extols the merits and virtues, ensuring the flourishing of the mysterious transformation, so that neither assembly falls into confusion or suffering.\n\nIf among the female Daoist assembly, where the nature is timid and no one in their position can instruct, they should gather in groups of three, five, or more, purify their three karmas, prepare their ritual implements, and receive the scriptural texts. They should draw near to a great master, visiting once or twice a day, then returning to their proper place.\n\nIf there is no female Daoist abbey near the master’s dwelling, they should seek residence in a devout household near the master’s abode, where they may perform morning rites, recite scriptures, and receive instruction as prescribed by the Code. They must maintain proper conduct in body, speech, and mind, transmitting teachings at the proper times. They must not violate the Code in their practice of the Dao, lest they provoke reproach from the inner and outer assemblies in both action and stillness, thereby corrupting the true and pure gate of the Dao.\n\nThose who transgress will invite harm, humiliation, and karmic retribution, falling outside the ranks of the pure. Their progress in the Dao and practice of rituals must be carefully assessed.\n\nIf the two assemblies share a karmic connection, the great master should perform the ritual. If the two assemblies have separate karmic connections, each may perform their own rituals.\n\n**Chapter on Prohibiting Wine**\nThe Code states: In all Daoist studies, one must understand that upholding precepts cultivates wisdom, stabilizes the body, and refines the mind, free from the delusion of wine’s evils.\n\nThose who seek tranquility and mindfulness—whether Daoist priests or female Daoist adepts—who enter the gate of the Dao are true children of the Dao. Those who indulge in wine at any of the twelve hours commit ten kinds of confusion and disorder: first, disobedience to masters and venerable elders, or to parents among outsiders; second, burdening disciples or the wives and children of outsiders; third, quarreling with fellow students or the brothers of outsiders; fourth, violating royal law; fifth, offending friends; sixth, falling from mounts; seventh, burning or drowning in fire or water; eighth, losing the way; ninth, suddenly losing mindfulness and wisdom; tenth, generating coarse behavior in the presence of circumstances.\n\nThese ten evils cause both the inner and outer assemblies, in the moment or afterward, to become mentally and physically confused, like those afflicted with madness. They lose awareness of time and fail to distinguish between inner and outer, shattering the twofold contemplation, disrupting the order of the mind, and destroying the three virtues. Their conduct and transformation lose all foundation.\n\nThey will constantly associate with three kinds of people: first, those who cultivate evil karma; second, those who consume flesh and blood; third, those who slaughter living beings.\n\nThey will also befriend five kinds of companions: first, those who distance themselves from parents and are unfilial; second, those who indulge in lust without restraint and defy propriety; third, those who ruin their families and lose their livelihoods, having no plan; fourth, those who violate codes and laws, stealing; fifth, those who are greedy for worldly pleasures and unsuited to the Dao.\n\nDay after day, month after month, year after year, they fail to collect their thoughts, lose their origin, and depart from their lineage. Before their eyes, they encounter six kinds of abandonment: first, abandonment by their master and preceptor; second, abandonment by their parents; third, abandonment by their brothers; fourth, abandonment by their sisters; fifth, abandonment by their friends; sixth, abandonment by their inner assembly. All these causes and conditions constitute the karmic retribution of the present life, bound to the treasure of the master.\n\nWhen expounding the Dharma in turn, one must repeatedly declare: having no prior close associates and no prior companions is the supreme method of cultivation—this is true renunciation. If old or ill, one may take medicine according to one’s portion; but if one exceeds this in greed and competition, it is the same as the present-life retribution.\n\n**Avoiding Pungent and Acrid Foods**\nThe precepts state: All Dao learners must know to cultivate the body and purify the mind without violating prohibitions. Whether Daoist priests or female Daoists, consuming the five pungent and acrid foods—called \"evil vegetables\"—is internally and externally unlawful and must not be transgressed. What are the five? First, leeks; second, garlic; third, scallions; fourth, onions; fifth, Chinese chives.\n\nMoreover, among all vegetables, those that are pungent in the present moment bring four kinds of harm and lack three kinds of share. What are the four? First, harm to the five viscera; second, harm to Dao cultivation; third, harm to the inner assembly; fourth, harm to the outer assembly. What are the three shares they lack? First, no share in ascending to the Dao altar; second, no share in invoking the divine spirits; third, no share in transforming men and women.\n\nOne must collect the three karmas: let not the mind seek, let not the body pursue, let not the mouth consume. Then the divine spirits may be hoped for, the Dao altar may be ascended, men and women may be transformed, the viscera will be clear and at peace, the breath will be fragrant and pure, morning and evening audiences will be held, the dwelling will be empty and open, responses will be felt, and blessings will descend, benefiting all conditions.\n\n**Regulations on Robes and Attire**\nThe precepts state: All Dao learners must know that upon entering the Dao, one removes worldly thoughts within and severs worldly ties without, inwardly guarding the Dharma gate and outwardly cultivating Dharma robes. Those who have renounced the household—whether Daoist priests or female Daoists—whether dwelling in the mountains for self-cultivation or traveling among people to transform them, must have proper standards for their inner and outer Dharma robes.\n\nFor those newly renounced who have not yet received the inner registers, the upper robe of immortal brown and the Dharma cloak should both have a number of strips, but not twenty-four. Upon receiving the *Five Thousand Words of Divine Incantations*, one must wear twenty-four strips, corresponding to the twenty-four qi. For those aged twenty-five and above who receive the *Dongshen Lingbao Dadong*, the upper robe of immortal brown should have thirty-two strips, modeling the thirty-two heavens, the honored among the heavens; the Dharma cloak should have twenty-eight strips, modeling the twenty-eight constellations, the spirits among the constellations. Twenty-four strips are also permissible.\n\nAccording to the body of Dao cultivation, the robes should extend one foot below the knee, with central yellow as the standard color. For those practicing the supreme method, purple is permitted. Those of lesser years or rank should not wear purple. For the inner robe and Dharma shirt, whether with straight or wide sleeves, they should be made of yellow or other light, pure colors, all with large collars crossing downward to cover six inches above the heart over the inner robe. For the inner robe and Dharma skirt, other light or dark colors may be used for the lining, with yellow as the outer layer. If patterned, light colors may be used for the outer layer, all extending to the ankles.\n\nFor female Daoists who possess the supreme method, light purple gauze may be used for the brown robe; if wearing a skirt, deep yellow must be used, and no other light colors may be employed. The upper, middle, and lower robes must not be calculated by the inner or outer edges—all should be made with wide hems sewn on, without personal insistence, to avoid being嫌 by the two assemblies: first, incurring the slander of the common world; second, incurring the slander of other paths. The true spirits will depart the body, lust and deviance will arise within, one will be unable to maintain inner purity, the Three Corpses will lurk in hiding, the Red Child will take flight, one will be forever parted from the mysterious chamber, the form will dissolve, the bones will unravel, the body will die, and the name will perish.\n\nIf one’s cap and robes always accord with the Dao, on the day of attaining the Dao, the Heavenly Emperor will bestow upon you the *Nine-Light Brocade Cloak of Li Luo*, the *Cinnabar-Silk Radiant Headscarf*, the *Heavenly Treasure Girdle*, and *Lion-Patterned Shoes*—called the *Attire of the Flying Immortals*—to reward the virtue of those who have accumulated merit through diligent seeking of the Dao. Do not covet the caps and crowns of the worldly, nor slight the robes of the Dao. Though the world may regard them as lowly and honorable, they do not escape death; the Dao learner’s headscarf and cloak accord with the heavens above. Wearing them to seek the Dao enables one to become a flying immortal riding the void.\n\n**Regulations on Headscarves and Caps**\nThe precepts state: All Dao learners must know that to be complete in dignity and have all matters settled, with a reputation and conduct beyond the common, is to be one who has renounced the household. Those who have renounced the household, when wearing the headscarf and cap of the highest rank, must know their symbolic forms and their uses.\n\nWhether Daoist priests or female Daoists, in ordinary cultivation, they wear the *Two Principles Headscarf*, which has two corners, modeling the Two Principles. When performing rituals and ascending the altar of the Three Registers’ communal fast, they wear the *Primordial Beginning’s Far-Wandering Cap*, or the supreme method of the *Light Ramie Headscarf*, which the Primordial Beginning wears. Thus, the heavenly perfected and upper sages may wear the *Nine Virtues Headscarf* or the *Seven Stars Headscarf*—that is, a cap and headscarf with the pattern of the seven stars—also called the *Mysterious Cap*. \"Mysterious\" refers to heaven, and heaven is also said to have seven stars.\n\nDao learners must always wear the hairpin and cap when lying down, sitting, or resting, so that the divine spirits may be revered and served, and not be temporarily set aside, lest the *Niwan* and *Xuanhua* spirits bear resentment. Only when combing and arranging the *Xuanhua* in the morning may it be temporarily set aside and placed on a clean headscarf. Moreover, it must not be exposed to the outer assembly of men and women or those not of the same covenant, nor lightly taken or played with.\n\nThose who are cautious in this regard gain five benefits: first, their own body is honored and respected; second, they avoid offenses with the outer assembly; third, they receive the praise of the true spirits; fourth, they inspire sentient beings to generate goodness; fifth, they increase the inner and outer fields of merit.\n\nThose who fail to guard and revere their headscarves and caps, allowing outsiders to recklessly take and toy with them, incur five kinds of karmic retribution for Dao learners: first, their own person is held in contempt and ridiculed; second, they cause outsiders to commit the sin of disrespect; third, the true spirits reproach them, and their Dao qi scatters and flees; fourth, sentient beings lose reverence; fifth, they incur guilt both inwardly and outwardly. Dao learners of both sexes must be clearly mindful and cautious, thereby generating the five benefits and extinguishing the five retributions.\n\nThrough this reverence for others, the sprouts of goodness grow; do not allow disdain for others to rot the roots of goodness. Thus, those of the outer world will respect our great Dharma and not slander or mock it—each must be vigilant in this regard.\n\n**Respect for Dharma Attire**\n\nIt is decreed: All Dao learners must know that upon entering the Dao, their upper, middle, and lower garments are all to be honored and respected, never treated with negligence or contempt. For those who have left the household life—whether Daoist priests or female Daoist adepts—their upper robe and cloak are most worthy of reverence. Why? Because the Heavenly Worthy and the sages all wear this same attire. As for the middle and lower garments, they assist our Dharma rituals; following the upper robe, they connect with the numinous through Dharma attire. Thus, the world honors them, distinguishing them from the common stream. If one treats them with disdain, one incurs guilt as the occasion arises.\n\nThe signs of reverence arise from five causes:\n1. Before donning them, store them in a case or box, placing them in a high, clean location;\n2. After donning them, whether sitting or rising, always keep them clean;\n3. When temporarily removing them, do not place them with secular clothing;\n4. Even among fellow learners of the same covenant, do not exchange them;\n5. Do not beg or borrow them from secular people for improper use; until they are worn out, keep them clean and burn them when discarding.\n\nThose who violate this incur guilt for both themselves and others. Those who revere Dharma attire gain five true causes of honor:\n1. Truly, through Dharma attire, they gain honor and need not bow in submission to outsiders, men or women;\n2. Truly, through Dharma attire, they gain honor, inspiring outsiders, men and women, to bow in reverence;\n3. Truly, through Dharma attire, they gain honor, and wherever they travel, clothing and food come to them unsought, receiving offerings;\n4. Truly, through Dharma attire, they gain honor, and through inner cultivation and outer submission, they connect with the luminous spirits;\n5. Truly, through Dharma attire, they gain honor, and outsiders—men, women, kings, princes, and emperors—hear of them and rejoice, harboring no ill will.\n\nWhat are the five causes of disdain?\n1. Before donning them, leaving them overturned and scattered in low, filthy places;\n2. After donning them, leaning or sitting anywhere without distinguishing clean from unclean;\n3. When temporarily removing them, mixing them with secular clothing;\n4. Exchanging them casually with those not of the same learning or Dharma;\n5. Begging or borrowing them from secular people for improper use.\n\nIn this life, such people receive five true retributions for their disdain:\n1. Truly, through disdain, they are held in contempt, reduced to the level of common folk, and must bow to others;\n2. Truly, through disdain, they are held in contempt and do not receive bows of reverence from men or women;\n3. Truly, through disdain, they are held in contempt, and wherever they travel, they do not receive timely clothing or food;\n4. Truly, through disdain, they are held in contempt, and through inner cultivation and outer submission, the spirits do not descend;\n5. Truly, through disdain, they are held in contempt, and outsiders—men, women, kings, princes, and emperors—hear of them or see them and feel no faith or reverence.\n\nDao learners of both sexes must thoughtfully honor and respect, never treating lightly to invite calamity and trouble. If garments are already worn out and unfit for wear, on an elimination day at dawn, after paying respects, burn them in a clean place, ensuring outsiders—men and women—do not casually see them.\n\nFor those who wear the Three Garments of true scriptures, whether lying down, sitting, or resting, they must not expose their heads; they must wear a headscarf or cap, and not expose their form; they must wear clothing.\n\n**Turning Away from the Dao**\n\nIt is decreed: All Dao learners must know that from the beginning of primordial qi to the attainment of the Dao, passing through the eight difficulties and suffering, they receive the body of one who has left the household life. Through the Dharma attire of our divine immortals, the robes of the Three Treasures, the immortal’s coarse robe and Dharma cloak, the upper, middle, and lower garments—all bearing symbolic meaning—by embodying the Dharma, they gain honor.\n\nWhether Daoist priests or female Daoist adepts, by the grace of the sovereign, their parents, and their masters, they attain the position of leaving the household life. They must make offerings to their masters and teachers, thereby escaping two kinds of prisons:\n1. **Inner prisons**, which entail lighter suffering: the prisons of parents, spouses, sons and daughters, brothers, sisters, social status, and internal and external relations. Within these, there are two kinds: first, the prison of joy, with bonds of affection and pleasures; second, the prison of anger, with oppression and suffering. Though joy and suffering differ, the prison remains the same.\n2. **Outer prisons**, which entail grave sins: prisons jointly created by parents, spouses, sons and daughters, brothers, sisters, social status, and internal and external relations. Within these, there are also two kinds: first, the prison of affliction, with both desired and undesired actions; second, the prison of joy, with harmonious and mutual desires. Though affliction and joy differ, the joint creation remains the same.\n\nToday, having left the household life, one escapes the four former conditions, vowing to endure hardship until attaining the Dao. When sitting in the Dao realm, one returns to teach and transform. If, before attaining realization, one turns against the true Dharma, generating even a single thought to cast off the Daoist robe and seek worldly pleasures, such a person immediately incurs three kinds of karmic retribution:\n1. They do not obtain an ill appearance, ill lifespan, ill reputation, or ill qi; they suffer themselves, and others view them with disgust...\n\nSecond, they suffer untimely calamities—yearly, monthly, daily, or hourly—where others commit sins yet they bear the consequences. Third, they incur wind-borne afflictions and leprosy; if they bear sons or daughters, these children are born deaf, blind, mute, or crippled, or may be seized by royal law, executed while alive. Once their evil exhausts the body, they repay the Three Officials, enduring the five hues and ninefold depths of darkness. All instruments of suffering stretch endlessly; the vastness of their form surpasses even the five-colored realms. Compared to the five-colored heavens, their karmic suffering fills the ninefold dark abodes, spanning kalpas uncounted without respite, even as this world’s heaven and earth endure. When the kalpic winds and waters arrive, they are swept to other realms, where amid dissolution they still suffer. Should an eternal kalpa pass, even if parents, siblings, children, sisters, relatives of high or low station, or friends—whether through self-reflection, shared remembrance, sequential thought, thoughts of food and drink, thoughts of wealth, thoughts of oppression, or thoughts of humiliation—induce an ordained one to cast off the Dharma robe, turn from the Dao, and follow worldly ways, know that such a person has, for kalpas beyond measure, rotted their good roots and grown their evil roots, destroying the treasure of the Dao, the treasure of the scriptures, and the treasure of the masters. Today, harboring great evil, they break and defile the Three Treasures’ field of merit, their original vows of renunciation arising from faith, their present retreat arising from slander. With faith’s root destroyed, the fire of slander burns them; having earned these sufferings, they are clearly warned within and without: strive diligently in cultivation, each seeking liberation.\n\n**Dwelling in the Mountains**\nThe section states: All Daoist learners should understand that the Dao’s propagation and the sages’ establishment of methods guide beginners to withdraw into mountain forests. Those who leave the household—whether Daoist priests or female Daoist adepts—should dwell in the mountains to seek quiet contemplation, avoiding common worldly interactions, preserving their life essence, shunning desires, and departing from defilement and disorder. The mountain-dwelling system differs from the world’s in ten matters of cause and condition:\n1. They must not register households to convert others;\n2. They must not associate with the noble and powerful to seek fame and profit;\n3. They must not practice heterodox spells or incantations;\n4. They must not accept money for medicine or divination, maintaining separation from the world;\n5. They must not share beds or seats with secular women, except for those of other teachings who dwell in the mountains with purity;\n6. At dawn, midday, sunset, during the hour of settling the mind, and at midnight when the cock crows, they should burn incense, light lamps, and pay reverence to the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions, repenting transgressions and eliminating evil. When paying reverence, begin with the east;\n7. After midday, they must not consume grains or qi-bearing substances. Non-grain substances—such as water, jade, mushrooms, stones, pine, wood, Solomon’s seal, cloud essence, *lingfei* powder, and *gouji*—may be consumed at any time and are not prohibited;\n8. When traversing mountains to gather herbs, take three steps and snap the fingers once; take ten steps and strike the chime once. With every step, constantly contemplate the Dao, imagining divine beings on cliffs and roadsides bestowing immortal arts, so that through cultivation and ingestion, one ascends to heaven in broad daylight;\n9. If one attains the Dao in small measure but has not yet fully realized it, do not display it arrogantly or belittle those who have not;\n10. Always remember the kindness of one’s parents in raising and nurturing the body.\n\nThese ten matters are the essentials of dwelling in the mountains to cultivate the Dao. Methods of ingestion and regulation are fully set forth in the original text.\n\n**Hair Care**\nThe section states: All Daoist learners should know that cultivating the body follows specific methods. The head is the Mysterious Flower; when combed and arranged properly, it preserves essence and prevents the hundred illnesses. Those who leave the household—whether Daoist priests or female Daoist adepts—should, whether inside or outside the abode, each prepare a clean comb and store it in a box. At cock’s crow, rise early and, before performing rites, face north, turn toward the direction of one’s natal star, wash the hands, and comb the hair. If the person is not a fellow student or of like mind, do not let them see or borrow the comb. After combing, proceed to the rites; if duties press urgently, combing may follow the rites. When combing, frequent strokes prevent blood stagnation and pain. After combing, recite the secret incantation in silence:\n*The Supreme Emperor scatters numinous power; the Five Elders return the spirit.\nThe Mysterious Flower of the Mud Pill preserves essence and ensures longevity.\nOn the right, the moon is concealed; on the left, the sun’s root is drawn.\nThe Six Harmonies are purified; the hundred spirits receive grace.*\nIf one fails to comb at the proper time, the two spirits grow resentful and do not support diligent practice. The first is the spirit of the Mysterious Flower; the second is the spirit of the Mud Pill. In the world, four kinds of self-harm prevent combing:\n1. Those resembling people burdened by worldly toil, unable to comb;\n2. Those resembling people afflicted by severe illness, unable to comb;\n3. Those resembling people with broken or severed fingers, unable to comb;\n4. Those resembling people who have retreated and become indolent, lacking the Dao, unable to comb.\nLearners should revere the two spirits and avoid the four harms. Female Daoist adepts must not imitate secular people, neglecting proper methods for vain and false practices, adorning their heads with gold, silver, copper, or iron, thereby incurring the dislike of both inner and outer assemblies. Though they harm no one, they bring disgrace upon themselves. After combing, if loose hairs remain, place them in a clean container for one, two, or up to nine days, then burn them in a clean place, ensuring neither inner nor outer assemblies see them.\n\n**Bathing**\nThe section states: All Daoist learners should know that the wise body is flawless, the enlightened mind a bright mirror; all dust and filth belong to this embodied self. Those who leave the household—whether Daoist priests or female Daoist adepts—when the mind clings to conditions and inner dust arises, should wash and bathe with the water of mindfulness, moment by moment.\n\nSince the body is dependent on external conditions and thus accumulates outer dust, it should be bathed with fragrant water at all times. The body’s acquisition of dust and filth through external conditions arises from four causes:\n\nFirst, the body serves as a field of merit—when managing ritual halls or receiving offerings, it gathers the dust of human effort.\nSecond, rising and sitting through the six periods of the day, it collects the dust of empty space.\nThird, attending to obligations and performing rites, it gathers the dust of past causes.\nFourth, failing to distinguish purity from impurity, it accumulates the dust of contact.\n\nThese habits cause Daoist learners to accumulate grime, leaving both upper and lower parts unclean. As a result, neither the inner nor outer assemblies feel inclined to take refuge, the deities of the four quarters withhold their power, and all petitions fail to summon divine illumination.\n\nAccording to the *Scripture of the Venerable Lord of the Cavernous Dao*, one should use the Five Fragrances method: green sandalwood, vitex blossoms, lemongrass, orchid, and true sandalwood. Prepare them in whatever quantity is available, finely chopping and boiling them until the fragrant water is ready. Both assemblies should then bathe in the scented water. If Daoist learners encounter times or places where these are unavailable, they may use whatever fragrant materials are at hand.\n\nThe methods of bathing include general days, specific days, inner assemblies, and outer assemblies.\n\n**Specific Days:**\nThe tenth day of the first month, the eighth day of the second month, the sixth day of the third month, the fourth day of the fourth month, the first day of the fifth month, the twenty-seventh day of the sixth month, the fifteenth day of the seventh month, the twenty-second day of the eighth month, the twentieth day of the ninth month, the eighteenth day of the tenth month, the fifteenth day of the eleventh month, and the twelfth day of the twelfth month. On these days, one should lodge by the Eastern Well, bathe in fragrant water, lightening the body and perfuming the form to attain longevity and unimpeded vitality.\n\nBefore bathing, first knock the teeth three times and recite the secret incantation:\n*\"The Four Great open and radiant, heaven and earth endure as constant.\nMystic water washes away filth, dispelling inauspiciousness.\nTwin youths guard the gate, the Seven Spirits secure the chamber.\nCloudy streams refine and cleanse, the ten thousand qi harmonize in health.\nInner and outer flourish in integrity, preserving this yellow robe.\nMorning and evening, in washing and rinsing, employ this method.\"*\n\nThe bathing chamber should be situated in a secluded corner of the dwelling, its interior and exterior sealed with clay to prevent those bathing from glimpsing the forms of the sun, moon, or stars. Even among fellow learners or companions, one should enter the chamber in sequence, never allowing mutual sight.\n\n**General Days:**\nWhen summoning both inner and outer assemblies on the same day, two secluded chambers should be arranged within the abbey, sufficiently distant to prevent the sound of voices or washing water from being heard. On the eighth day of the twelfth month, as the year draws to a close, boil whatever fragrant materials are available to prepare the water, adjusting the temperature appropriately. The master should place a talisman into the fragrant water, then allow men and women to bathe separately in chambers proportionate to their numbers.\n\n---\n\n**Dispelling Filth**\n\nThe section states: All Daoist learners should know that as they wander mountains and marshes or guide beings in the world, those who have left the household—whether Daoist priests or female Daoist adepts—encounter five kinds of filth that cannot be instantly avoided:\n\n1. **Self-inflicted filth:** In walking, standing, sitting, or rising, blood may suddenly rain from the empty sky in greater or lesser amounts, staining the head, face, hands, feet, or robes. Or crows, magpies, or storks may carry corpses—whole or in parts—dropping them unexpectedly before one. This is called self-inflicted filth.\n\n2. **Incidental filth:** While traversing mountains to gather herbs or teaching in the world, one may encounter corpses on winding paths, see the dead in the grass, or witness lewd acts or other impure sights. These are not sought but unexpectedly seen, and are called incidental filth.\n\n3. **Self-sought filth:** Through familiarity with worldly ties, financial dealings, or visits to the homes of relatives and friends after deaths, one may willingly attend funerals or condolence calls without external compulsion. This is called self-sought filth.\n\n4. **Filth of power and status:** When officials of secular power or rank experience deaths in their households, pressure from superiors and subordinates may force one to attend, despite fear of reprimand or personal reluctance. Bowing in grief before the deceased, one sees the corpse. This is called the filth of power and status.\n\n5. **Filth of association:** When laywomen or livestock such as cattle, horses, donkeys, mules, pigs, sheep, or dogs give birth, one may wish to see or personally observe the impure scene. This is called the filth of association.\n\nThose who encounter filth should not participate in ritual petitions or fasts. Instead, take bamboo leaves and peach branches, along with whatever fragrant materials are available, boil them in pure water, and place the liquid in a large basin. Then draw a talisman and cast it into the basin. If the filth encountered is severe, one should bathe; if minor, one may simply wash.\n\nBefore dispelling filth, knock the teeth three times and recite the secret incantation:\n*\"The Four Great open and radiant, heaven and earth endure as constant.\nMystic water washes away filth, dispelling inauspiciousness.\nTwin youths guard the gate, the Seven Spirits secure the chamber.\nCloudy streams refine and cleanse, the ten thousand qi harmonize in health.\nInner and outer flourish in integrity, preserving this yellow robe.\"*\n\nIf hosting a communal fast or lecture and fearing that members of the outer assembly—men or women—may have encountered filth, place a large basin filled with talismanic water at the main gate. Instruct all who enter to wash their eyes before proceeding to hear the Dharma.\n\n---\n\n**Bells and Chimes**\n\nThe section states: All Daoist learners should know that to enter the realm of the Middle Way is to awaken the mind-king, identical yet not different. Among those who have left the household—whether Daoist priests or female Daoist adepts—some may practice divergent methods before their fellow Daoists. There are five types of such individuals:\n\n1. Those who refine elixirs for livelihood,\n2. Those who administer external medicines to heal,\n3. Those who undertake construction to establish merit,\n4. Those who consume medicinal foods to cultivate the body,\n5. Those who cultivate wisdom to liberate beings.\n\nDuring scripture recitation, ritual fasts, Daoist practices, or the establishment of Dharma rites to receive offerings, without bells and chimes to alert and summon the assembly, each may follow their own path, arriving at different times or not at all. Thus, the *Scripture of the Middle Prime* states:\n*\"In the long fast at the Mystic Capital, jade is struck and chimes of nephrite resound.\nThe Ten Flowers gather the immortals, purple mists congeal into a palace.\"*\n\nAt the left front platform of the ritual hall, bells and chimes shall be hung and struck at the appointed times. This not only alerts and gathers the assembly but also moves the host of spirits. During the six periods of the day, practitioners must fasten their sashes and maintain solemnity, striking the mallet with proper form—first dense, then gradually sparse, totaling eight strikes. After a second dense sequence, wait until the incense fire is prepared, then begin again with dense strikes, gradually thinning to twelve. Once more, strike densely, increasing to twelve, then conclude with two final dense sequences of twelve strikes each. If summoning the assembly requires a slower pace, follow it without disrupting the timing.\n\nWhen the bell tolls, five timely benefits arise:\n1. The assembly gathers for ritual without delay,\n2. Purity is received at the proper hour,\n3. The collective resolve is roused without delay,\n4. Evil thoughts are dispelled without delay,\n5. Distinct good intentions arise without delay.\n\nThe cessation of wrongdoing and the practice of virtue truly depend on the bells and chimes. Their aid sustains diligent effort, and success lies in mindful application. They urge the six periods of the day toward progress, guiding one straight to the Daoist sanctuary. Let them not instead cause the six periods to regress, returning one to the paths of evil. This is proclaimed for future generations.\n\nFor both inner and outer assemblies, harmonizing great vows involves two causes:\n1. Harmonizing personal vows,\n2. Harmonizing communal vows.\n\nWhether undertaken privately or collectively, whether heard privately or collectively, one must advance with diligence in upholding and practicing them.\n\n**Section on Fasting Rituals**\nAll Daoist practitioners must know what to cultivate—whether in mind or in deed—with fasting and stillness as the foundation, the root of virtue, and the basis of seeking the Dao. For Daoists and female adepts, fasting is required for:\n- Reciting scriptures,\n- Collating scriptures,\n- Inscribing talismans,\n- Compounding medicines,\n- Refining the Golden Elixir,\n- Deep contemplation,\n- Seeking instruction from a master,\n- Prostrations,\n- Receiving scriptures,\n- Salvation and disaster relief,\n- Attaining the True.\n\nThe Most High reveres it; Lord Lao protects it; all sages rely upon it. There are many fasting methods, depending on the practitioner’s chosen path:\n- Register Initiation Morning Rites,\n- *Five Thousand Characters* Morning Rites,\n- *Lingbao* Morning Rites,\n- *Shangqing* Morning Rites,\n- *Three Sovereigns* Morning Rites,\n- Upper Prime Fasting for Elixir Refinement and Immortality,\n- Middle Prime Fasting for Self-Cultivation and Atonement,\n- Lower Prime Fasting for Deliverance of the Nine Ancestors,\n- Eight Emperors Fasting,\n- Three-Five Grand Fasting,\n- Lower Prime Thirty-Two Heavens Fasting,\n- Middle Prime Invocation of the Seventy-Two Lords Fasting,\n- Upper Prime Six Direct Fasting,\n- *Lingbao* Golden Register Fasting for Deliverance of Lords and Kings,\n- Yellow Register Fasting for Salvation of the Nine Ancestors,\n- Illuminating the True Fasting for Self-Cultivation,\n- Three Primes Fasting for Atonement,\n- *Lingbao* Natural Fasting for Worldly Engagement,\n- Mud and Charcoal Fasting for Healing,\n- *Zhijiao* Fasting for Healing,\n- *Lingbao* Five Refinements for Reviving the Corpse Fasting for Self-Salvation,\n- *Five Thousand Characters* Fasting,\n- *Taiping Dongyuan* Five Kings Fasting.\n\nA vegetable diet in Daoist practice leads to attainment—this is the foremost discipline. Next in rank are fasts of a thousand days, a hundred days, monthly or daily abstentions, coarse or medicinal diets, qi consumption, drug ingestion, or embryonic nourishment, each taken as one’s capacity allows—this is what was previously called self-cultivation.\n\nFor inner and outer assemblies addressing great calamities, disasters, or karmic roots, a single high virtue is chosen as the Dharma Master, with five as attendant officials. A public altar is erected for grand atonement, where the penitent wears a hempen cord, scatters hair, and smears mud on the forehead, paying homage to the Thirty-Two Heavens. During the fast, petitions are offered at midnight and noon, and earnest prayers will surely be answered, following the instructed Mud and Charcoal method.\n\nFor the Five Kings Fasting, the officiant observes the numbers of the four seasons and months in spring, autumn, winter, and summer. The poor may gather twelve, while grand fasts require one hundred twenty, with worship conducted on a narrow outer altar. For regular fasts established by the wealthy or commoners, upright Daoists or mountain scholars may gather five, ten, twenty, fifty, or a hundred—though if many cannot be assembled, the number need not be fixed. Ritual garments are worn, and the Way is practiced for twenty-one days or a month.\n\nFor the impoverished, contributions are made according to ability, without requiring five participants. During the fast, a simple morning gruel is served, a midday vegetarian meal, and after noon, ginger-honey tea—nothing else passes the teeth. When breaking the fast, a feast is shared with ten, a hundred, or a thousand people, with more being better.\n\nIn prolonged fasting and precept observance, the Way is practiced at dawn, noon, and dusk—three times for ritual, three times for scripture recitation. For severe disasters, great calamities, or deliverance from karmic roots, the Way is practiced at six periods: dawn, noon, dusk, first watch, midnight, and cockcrow, with scriptures recited thrice daily.\n\n**Section on Recitation**\nAll Daoist practitioners must know that treasuring scriptures through mindful recitation makes them a compassionate mother. Whether Daoist or female adept, with courage and diligence—whether reciting from memory or reading aloud—each thought that generates understanding enters the gate of wisdom.\n\nDuring recitation, listen to one or two parts in eighty, while attending to external duties and rituals. Do not let this lead to distraction or deviation from the宗旨. Constantly reflect on the teaching mother as the root of our Dao, purifying the three karmas without harming reverence. Contemplate the subtle and wondrous, grasping its meaning and flavor, which yields four kinds of wisdom:\n1. Wisdom as my medicine, curing the madness of death,\n2. Wisdom as my lamp, dispelling the darkness of ignorance,\n3. Wisdom as my blade, severing the net of afflictions,\n4. Wisdom as my boat, ferrying across the sea of birth and death.\n\nThis is the true scriptural Dharma, capable of generating the Dharma-body, just as a worldly mother gives birth to her child. Thus, the most filial child constantly remembers the nurturing embrace of parental care—so too should we. Through this teaching mother, the untainted body is born, and we must always repay her kindness with offerings, enshrining her in a hall adorned with the seven treasures, with incense, flowers, lamps, candles, music, banners, and canopies, honoring her through recitation as one would a beloved parent.\n\n**Chapter on Seated Fasting and Disciplinary Penalties**\n\n**Section:** All Daoist practitioners must understand that proper decorum is essential when ascending the altar to perform rituals, maintaining reverence for the Most High as if present before their very eyes. Should Daoist priests or nuns be unfamiliar with the liturgical texts, their conduct may stray from the Way. When the Dharma-master ascends the high seat to elucidate matters in due order, guiding them toward awakening, those who err out of ignorance or confusion deserve compassion and pardon. They should be admonished and encouraged, neither resented nor ridiculed. To skillfully guide while remaining unoppressive, to govern without severity, and to refrain from disciplinary measures—this is the mark of a virtuous and noble demeanor.\n\nYet there are four kinds of those who, relying on worldly knowledge, persist in negligence and arrogance by defying the Dao:\n1. Those who disregard the scriptural Dharma,\n2. Those who disrespect the Dharma-master,\n3. Those who slight the assembled officials,\n4. Those who mock the outer assembly.\n\nFor violations of decorum, penalties shall be imposed according to the offense. If the transgression persists, the Three Treasures must be invoked, and the offender removed from the fasting rites. No leniency shall be granted, lest negligence spread unchecked. Those who supervise the fast and likewise show contempt shall also be penalized.\n\nShould the Dharma-master falter, they must acknowledge their error before the assembled officials, seek forgiveness through repentance, and renew their resolve. They must not persist in wrongdoing, defy the unseen decree, or compound their offense, for such actions endanger their own person. How could one not be vigilant?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Altar Rituals**\n\n**Section:** All Daoist practitioners must understand that when the assembled officials ascend the altar to receive the precepts, the inner and outer assemblies shall array themselves in the four directions, observing proper order in prostrations, kneeling, and supplications. When Daoist priests or nuns intone the invocations to the ten directions, the liturgy is divided into five phrases. At the beginning of each phrase, the voice rises, then descends in the subsequent phrase, modulating tone and breath to call forth the next line.\n\n*\"With utmost sincerity, we bow in reverence, tablets aligned before us, turning toward the honored direction. We submit our lives [to the boundless of] the [designated] direction—raising our voices to invoke the Upper Realm, lowering the tablets as the sound gently descends to the earth, then returning them to the heart, responding to the boundless call.\"*\n\nThereafter, the Most High descends the tablet, placing it before the knees, then to the ground. For the *Lingbao Heavenly Worthy*, the head is lowered to the earth. When the voice pauses, the hands and knees follow in measured delay. If the knees move before the voice concludes, or if voice and gesture fall out of sync, it is deemed negligent and incurs fault. One must click the teeth in mindfulness, ensuring the pace is unhurried. The sound of the teeth must not be audible. Conduct must align with the liturgical canons, the assembly solemn and reverent. Above, this humbles the divine spirits; below, it awakens faith. There is no excuse for negligence, for it violates the luminous precepts.\n\n**The Upper Scroll of the* Dongxuan Lingbao Daoist Liturgical Canons *concludes here.**\n**The Lower Scroll of the* Dongxuan Lingbao Daoist Liturgical Canons *begins.**\n\n**The Ranks of the Primordial Void Perfected One on Lamp-Lighting**\n\nThe liturgical canons state: All Daoist practitioners must know the methods of offering and worship, which are observed both at dawn and at night. The rites of lamp-lighting comprise both initial kindling and subsequent replenishment. When Daoists or female officers light lamps before darkness falls, it is called \"continuing the light.\" When lamps are lit after darkness has descended, it is called \"illuminating the light.\" There are two modes of lamp-lighting: the general and the specific.\n\nThe general mode proceeds thus: first, lamps are kindled before the visible sacred treasures—the Dao Treasure and the Scripture Treasure. Next, lamps are kindled before the chambers of the visible Perfected Masters. Additionally, in accordance with personal past affinities or revered moments in Daoist practice, lamps may be lit when entering or exiting a space to invoke two kinds of blessings: first, to aid the celestial radiance and pray for the purity of the physical eyes, dissolving obstructions and veils; second, to aid the celestial radiance and pray for clarity in all places one traverses, that one may always perceive with brightness.\n\nThe specific mode proceeds thus: for one’s own cultivation on the *benming* day, three lamps are lit to illuminate the Three Hun; for the *xingnian*, seven lamps are lit to illuminate the Seven Po; for the *taisui*, one lamp is lit to illuminate the entire body; for the *damu*, three lamps are lit; for the *xiaomu*, five lamps are lit; before the hall, seven lamps are lit to illuminate the Seven Ancestors; in the central courtyard, nine lamps are lit to illuminate the Nine Netherworlds; beside the gate, two lamps are lit to illuminate the palace and residence; at the earthly portal, twenty-four lamps are lit to illuminate the Twenty-Four Vital Breaths; toward the eight directions, eight lamps are lit to illuminate the Eight Trigrams; on the four sides and at the center, nine lamps are lit to illuminate the Nine Palaces; facing the ten directions, ten lamps are lit to illuminate the Ten Directions; twenty-eight lamps are lit to illuminate the Twenty-Eight Constellations; thirty-two lamps are lit to illuminate the Thirty-Two Heavens; and five lamps are distributed among the Five Directions to illuminate the Five Sacred Peaks. In total, one hundred and fifty-three lamps are lit.\n\nThe ritual decorum of lamp-lighting carries profound merit: above, it illuminates all heavens; below, it illuminates all earths. For eight directions and nine nights, its radiance is universally perceived. The officers attending the lamps must apply diligent care, ensuring the lamp flames burn brightly and clearly, never extinguishing midway or flickering dimly.\n\n**The Ranks on the Pre-Chanting of Water**\n\nThe liturgical canons state: All Daoist practitioners must know that after midday, one abstains from flavored drink and partakes only of pure water. Whether at any of the twelve hours when thirst arises and water is needed, or when invoking spells to repel malevolent forces, Daoists or female officers shall take a cup of water, exhale toward it three times, and strike the cup three times with an object. After chanting the spell and striking the cup three times, one exhales three times before drinking. If many are present, a larger vessel may be used. The incantation states:\n\nThe qi of the Five Stars—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth—the essence of the Six Jia, the Three Perfected of Heavenly Granary, ever full amid the turbid clouds, the Yellow Script and the Red Child, guarding the center without inclining.\n\nThe incantation may be spoken thus:\n*\"Drinking water dispels hunger, extends life, and brings vigor; it repels malevolence.\"*\n\nIt may also be spoken thus:\n*\"Qian, Yuan, Li, Zhen—divine water enters the belly, the Five Viscera grow clear and bright.\"*\n\nDrink to completion; either method may be employed.\n\n**The Ranks on Memorials and Petitions**\n\nThe liturgical canons state: All Daoist practitioners must know the method of memorials and petitions. Whether invoking the resident deities or the responsive deities of the void, the paper and ink used for the memorial must be pure. The writing must be without hasty strokes or omissions, nor may one use scraps or torn fragments of paper. The language of the petition should be plain and direct, without ornate embellishment. Cultivate the qi and rectify the One; fold the paper into eight parts.\n\nThe memorial should state:\n*\"Presented to the Three Heavenly Courts for their attention,\"*\nfollowed by two bows. One inch down, write three columns, then place the petitioner’s surname. Three columns after the surname, record the year and month, followed again by the petitioner’s surname. In the center, write *\"Great Clarity,\"* two and a half inches in length, or three inches if truly proper, ensuring the script is legible. Leave three blank columns at the end; if insufficient, attach additional paper.\n\nWhen the libationer presents the memorial, strictly avoid the days of *wu-chen* and *wu-xu*, as well as the reckoning of strikes.\n\nOnce the memorial is presented, gather one hundred copies to carry on one’s person, then compose a \"Merit-Reporting Memorial\" to burn them. This must not be done carelessly, lest one incur the sin of leakage and disclosure.\n\nThe Merit-Reporting Memorial to be burned is as follows:\n\n**From the *Tai-Zhen Regulations*:**\n*\"I humbly submit this report in accordance with the documents: Your servant [Name], having in the year [Year] received from Master [Name] the inner and outer governance of the Generals, has cultivated the Dao in accordance with the methods, propagated the qi of the Dao, and summoned the Perfected Officials to deliver and protect the myriad families. All previous memorials, petitions, and written supplications that were not to be burned immediately have been recorded, sealed in boxes, and bundled together. The accumulated methods must not be scattered or used carelessly, nor given to others for improper use. Furthermore, they must not be leaked, gnawed by insects or rodents, exposed to moisture, allowed to rot or decay, or lost. From the beginning, I have followed the regulations and dared not violate the decrees. Today, in accordance with the statutes and the appointed time, I submit and destroy them. From the year [Year] to this day, a total of [Number] scrolls are to be incinerated in seclusion, their smoke ascending to the clouds to bring auspiciousness and dispel misfortune.*\n\n*I humbly request the Direct Envoys of the Orthodox Unity Merit Officers, the Tiger-Rushing Guardians of the Governance Center, the Bell-Bearing Five Hundred Generals (two each), the Commanders (twelve), the Merit Officers, Scribes, Assistants, and Minor Officials, the Golden Radiance Lads (five each), the Cloud-Department Memorial Officers, the Inspectors, and the Attendant Envoys (two each) to simultaneously oversee and attend to the matter, reviewing and removing the old and dust-laden, and accepting the new and radiant. May they pardon my foolish shortcomings and past transgressions, and grant that all I have submitted be heard and exempted from the Cold Pool.*\n\n*I beseech the various officials to bear witness and assist in merit, in accordance with the Capital’s Merit-Reporting Memorial, so that my faithfulness may not be in vain. With grace from the Most High...*\n\n*Submitted by your servant [Name], with a bow. I request the officials to oversee and ensure that the memorial papers are destroyed and exempted, in accordance with the usual rites.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Invitation Offerings**\n\nThe regulations state: All Daoist scholars should know that cultivation and invocation bring benefit. Having a mind and a body, and since the body is borrowed from others, one has not yet transcended the heavenly Dao. Any cultivation or salvation requires the practice of offering invocations.\n\nWithin the gates of the Dao, both inner and outer, amidst the Three Teachings, this pertains to the mixed teachings. Internally, it begins with the mind; externally, it involves disciplining the body.\n\nThe term \"offering\" has nine ranks:\n1. **Five Emperors Offering**\n2. **Seven Stars Offering**\n3. **Six Jia Offering**\n4. **Three Masters Offering**\n\nThese four offerings invoke celestial deities. When preparing the offerings, the fruits and implements must be especially pure and fresh. One must not purchase or use foods that are:\n- Cooked by fire but not solemnly prepared,\n- Impure,\n- Not offered with single-minded devotion,\n- Not for the relief of suffering.\n\nThose who violate this will not attract the descent of celestial deities.\n\nAdditionally, there are:\n5. **Five Peaks Offering**\n6. **Three Sovereigns Offering**\n7. **Three Ones Offering**\n8. **River Chart Offering**\n9. **Residential Offering**\n10. **Three-Five Offering**\n\nThese six offerings invoke earthly deities. When preparing the offerings, the fruits and implements must be especially pure and fresh. One must not purchase or use foods that are:\n- Cooked by fire but not solemnly prepared,\n- Impure,\n- Not offered with single-minded devotion,\n- Not for the relief of suffering.\n\nThose who violate this will not attract the descent of earthly deities.\n\nFor all offerings to celestial and earthly deities, the officiants and masters must first purify themselves through fasting, bathing, and abstinence before proceeding with the ritual.\n\nAfter the Winter Solstice and Summer Solstice, the first *jia-zi* day is to be used for the **Upper Prime Jia-Zi Offering**.\n\n---\n\n**Prohibitions**\n\nThe regulations state: All Daoist scholars should know that cultivating the body to seek transcendence ultimately aims for the true Dao. Entering the gate of sequential practice requires first prohibiting and distinguishing desires.\n\nIf Daoists or female officials have left behind worldly attachments and entered the gate of the Dao, they must be especially mindful of the taboos within the gate of the Dao. They should vow to observe all prohibitions and proceed directly to the Daoist sanctuary.\n\nWhat are these distinguished desires? Briefly enumerated, there are eighteen kinds, not caused by others but self-inflicted defeats:\n1. Defeat by deviant lust,\n2. Defeat by secret malice,\n3. Defeat by drinking alcohol,\n4. Defeat by laziness and negligence,\n5. Defeat by disobeying parents,\n6. Defeat by disobeying masters and superiors,\n7. Defeat by harming sentient beings,\n8. Defeat by killing sentient beings,\n9. Defeat by using the flesh of sentient beings,\n10. Defeat by eating the flesh of sentient beings,\n11. Defeat by planting the Five Pungent Plants,\n12. Defeat by using the Five Pungent Plants,\n13. Defeat by eating the Five Pungent Plants,\n14. Defeat by defecating or urinating while facing north,\n15. Defeat by removing one’s headwear or crown in the presence of the Two Assemblies,\n16. Defeat by disrespecting the Three Luminaries,\n17. Defeat by imposing punishments on the Eight Festival Days,\n18. Defeat by displaying anger or scolding on the first day of the lunar month.\n\nAll these defeats are great prohibitions of heaven and humanity. The Three Officials will record and investigate them, constituting grave sins:\n1. **Defeating the body** results in present-life evil retribution;\n2. **Defeating the mind** results in future-life evil destinies, causing the Three Hun to become afflicted, the Seven Po to flow competitively, and the Womb Spirit to detest one. When the Three Officials receive the record of evil, nightmares will torment the cinnabar heart, demons will seize the vermilion gates, essence and fluids will scatter, and the Perfected Spirits will become disoriented. If one can renounce desires, one becomes a candidate for immortality. One should maintain true fasting and precepts, avoid all defeats, and in walking, standing, sitting, and rising, not damage one’s dignity. Above, one repents for the three karmic offenses of the seven generations of ancestors and parents; below, one repents for the boundless sins of one’s own body. May one’s sins be extinguished, and may one be exempted from the fifteen kinds of contempt from others based on the three karmas:\n\n1. Exemption from contempt by external noble persons,\n2. Exemption from contempt by external wealthy persons,\n3. Exemption from contempt by external middle-class persons,\n4. Exemption from contempt by external sick persons,\n5. Exemption from contempt by external lowly persons,\n6. Exemption from contempt by internal masters and superiors,\n7. Exemption from contempt by internal persons superior to oneself,\n8. Exemption from contempt by internal persons inferior to oneself,\n9. Exemption from contempt by internal senior persons,\n10. Exemption from contempt by internal junior persons,\n11. Exemption from contempt by internal persons of the same rank,\n12. Exemption from contempt by internal upper-seat persons,\n13. Exemption from contempt by internal middle-seat persons,\n14. Exemption from contempt by internal lower-seat persons,\n15. Exemption from contempt by internal sick persons.\n\nAll these forms of contempt, when contemplated in conduct, lead to being treated with contempt.\n\nWhen contemplated in dwelling, dwelling leads to contempt;\nWhen contemplated in sitting, sitting leads to contempt;\nWhen contemplated in rising, rising leads to contempt.\n\nOne should thereby be exempt from the sufferings of the five-directional hells.\nDiligently aspire to the supreme, vowing to depart from the causes of contempt,\nvowing to receive the causes of reverence and esteem.\nThus may one attain the power of the Dao,\nattain the dharma of the Dao,\nattain the practices of the Dao,\nattain the wealth of the Dao.\nAccording to one’s portion, benefit both inner and outer assemblies.\nAmong those without the Dao, no poverty;\namong those without the Dao, no suffering;\namong the secular, no poverty;\namong the secular, no suffering.\nBe my aid in practice,\ntogether with others, attain non-action,\nequal and pure,\nand realize the supreme Dao.\n\n**Divine Pillow Chapter**\n*Section Note:* All Daoist scholars should know that to make a divine pillow, it must contain thirty-two substances.\nTwenty-four of these correspond to the twenty-four qi;\nthe eight poisons correspond to the eight winds.\nOn the fifth day of the fifth month or the seventh day of the seventh month,\ntake cypress from the mountains and forests to make the pillow,\none foot and two inches in length, four inches in height,\nwith a hollow capacity of one *dou* and two *sheng*.\nUse red-hearted cypress for the lid, four *fen* thick,\nskillfully crafted to be tight and also easily opened and closed.\nBore three rows of holes on the lid, forty-nine holes per row,\nfor a total of one hundred forty-seven holes, each the size of a millet grain.\n\nThe medicinal ingredients are:\n*Chuanxiong* (Ligusticum chuanxiong)\n*Danggui* (Angelica sinensis)\n*Baizhi* (Angelica dahurica)\n*Xinyi* (Magnolia biondii)\n\nDuheng (Asarum forbesii)\nKuandonghua (Tussilago farfara)\nGao ben (Ligusticum sinense, mother of *Chuanxiong*)\nShujiao (Zanthoxylum piperitum)\nGui (Cinnamomum cassia)\nGanjiang (Zingiber officinale, dried ginger)\nFangfeng (Saposhnikovia divaricata)\nRenshen (Panax ginseng)\nJiegeng (Platycodon grandiflorus)\nBaiwei (Cynanchum atratum)\nRoucongrong (Cistanche deserticola)\nFeilian (Carduus crispus)\nBai shi (Cypress fruit)\nYiyiren (Coix lacryma-jobi)\nBaimu (unknown, possibly *Paeonia suffruticosa* or *Quercus* species)\nMulan (Magnolia liliflora)\nHeng hua (unknown, possibly *Daphne genkwa*)\nQinjiao (Zanthoxylum armatum)\nLianwu (unknown, possibly *Ligusticum sinense* or *Angelica* species)\nJingshi (Vitex negundo, also called Dujingshi)\n\nThese twenty-four substances correspond to the twenty-four qi. Additionally, eight poisons are added:\nWutou (Aconitum carmichaelii)\nFuzi (Aconitum carmichaelii, lateral root)\nLilu (Veratrum nigrum)\nZaojia (Gleditsia sinensis)\nYushi (arsenic ore)\nMangcao (Illicium lanceolatum)\nBanxia (Pinellia ternata)\nXixin (Asarum heterotropoides)\n\nThese thirty-two substances, each weighing one *liang*, are arranged with the eight poisons placed at the bottom and the twenty-four ingredients on top, pressed firmly into place. Encase them in a cloth pouch to clothe the pillow.\n\nRegular use of this pillow for one hundred days will impart a lustrous complexion. Within a year, all illnesses and wind-induced ailments will be cured, and the body will become entirely fragrant. After four years, white hair will turn black, fallen teeth will regrow, and hearing and vision will sharpen. Though the pillow is clothed in a cloth pouch, it should be further wrapped in a reed cover. Remove this outer layer only when lying down to use the pillow.\n\n**Essential Methods of the Bright Mirror**\nThe teachings state: All Daoist practitioners must know how to observe the mirror. To perceive one’s form, one should slightly open a door, sit in darkness facing the light, briefly close the eyes, and visualize the face. Initially, all appears dim and indistinct, but after a night’s practice, vision gradually extends, and one’s face and eyes become clearly visible, bright and luminous. The best times are dawn and before sunset. At midday, when the sun is fiercest, slightly close the door and peer into the mirror in the dazzling light—nothing will be seen. Never observe the mirror by firelight; keep the fire at a distance, avoiding its direct glow.\n\nIf one wishes to open the eyes and observe the body in the mirror, do so in bright light without discomfort. To close the eyes and visualize the face, sit in darkness facing the light, then perceive the form. The key to mirror-gazing is to lie down calmly, focus the mind, and concentrate sincerely. In the moments before sleep, the body remains relaxed. Soon, a red or yellow light will emerge from the forehead, illuminating the entire room. In this hazy, dreamlike state, one sees their face within the light. After a brief mutual gaze, the vision fades. Upon waking, gaze into the mirror again. Before sleep, repeat the visualization as before, and nightly visions will appear. Sometimes upon waking, two faces appear opposite each other, or one’s own form is seen alongside another. In moments of sitting or lying in reverie, one may see divine youths or jade maidens, fifteen or sixteen years old, beautifully attired, their foreheads clearly visible—bow to them at once. One may hear voices beside them, foretelling all matters of fortune and misfortune under heaven. One may see through walls, or in dreams at dusk, gaze into the mirror. The light may return, allowing inner vision of the five viscera.\n\nFor mirror-gazing, follow the method of establishing the compass on the first *jia* day: use a nine-inch mirror, ensuring its surface is flawless and perfectly clear. Place it at eye level, fifteen inches to either side, with well-water drawn at dawn beneath it. At night, use a lamp fueled by hemp oil. Upon seeing one’s form, descend to the ground, bow deeply, and kneel, saying: *\"I share the same body with you; now our forms are divided. I beg for ten thousand years of sustenance, to always accompany you, that my body and form may never decline, and we may remain together for ten thousand years.\"*\n\nWithin the bright mirror, first observe the form, then perceive all things and hear human voices. Cultivate the bright mirror, and three youths and nine maidens will attend you: the youths standing six feet tall, the maidens five feet tall. The Bright Mirror Lord, with an official retinue of one hundred twenty attendants, governs the Palace of Guanyin. The pupils of his eyes emit radiant light, perceiving all fortune and misfortune. Long ago, a Daoist mirror-polisher earned his living grinding mirrors for common folk, charging only six or seven coins. He had no other method but to apply a medicinal paste, making the mirrors so luminous they could divide forms and induce transformations. This practice also sharpens the mind, enabling foresight of all things for ten thousand years.\n\nIt also enables one to meet with the gods of the various heavens. By practicing the Dao and attaining the method, all divine immortals will come, and the Daoist will achieve the Dao.\n\nWhen a Daoist resides in a stone chamber, they should always hang a nine-inch bright mirror behind their back to ward off all evil. Moreover, though the hundred ghosts and ancient beings may transform their shapes, they cannot alter their reflections in the mirror. Upon seeing their forms in the mirror, they will immediately dissipate, causing no harm.\n\n**Nine-Noded Staff**\n\nThe Regulations state: All Daoist practitioners must know the nine-noded staff, which assists the elderly and rescues those in peril, each node bearing a name that must not be unknown.\n- The first node is called the Star of the Grand Sovereign,\n- The second node the Star of Mars,\n- The third node the Horn Star,\n- The fourth node the Star of the Balance,\n- The fifth node the Spread Star,\n- The sixth node the Encampment Star,\n- The seventh node the Star of Saturn,\n- The eighth node the Eastern Well Star,\n- The ninth node the Restraining Star.\n\nEach node is carved with the name of its corresponding star. Masters under forty who have not received the scriptural methods are deemed \"without rank\" and may not carry the staff. If afflicted by illness, they may use the staff to aid their recovery, but only when in the presence of their master; otherwise, they may not carry it.\n\n**Method of Forging the Divine Sword**\n\nThe Regulations state: All Daoist practitioners must know the method of forging the great sword. After one hundred days of purification, a smith is to use iron on the *gengshen* day of the seventh month or the *xinyou* day of the eighth month. If fine steel is employed, a sharp and refined sword is made: the ring two inches and six *fen* in diameter, the hilt one foot one inch and seven *fen* long, and the blade two feet four inches and seven *fen* long, totaling three feet nine inches in length. The ringed hook is three feet nine inches long, one inch and four *fen* wide, and three and a half *fen* thick, with a nine-inch tip forming the double-edged portion. The ring is mounted at the head, and both sides are carved with nine-blade characters. On the back of the ring, nine *ji* characters are inscribed, all aligned with the blade’s edge and carved deeply along the ring.\n\nThe characters are inlaid with gold or silver to enhance clarity. At the center of the ring, a raised half-ring projection is made, with the interior of the ring carved from wood: the left side bears the character for \"sun,\" and the right side the character for \"moon,\" its light encircled by an outer rim. To distinguish the sword’s left and right, inner and outer sides, on the second day of the second month, face south with the sword’s spine upward and its edge downward. Thus, east is left, west is right; the east side is outer, the west side inner.\n\nAt the nine-inch tip where the double edges begin, vertical carvings are made. Between the two edges, on the upper inner and outer surfaces, three *ding* characters are inscribed on each side, starting from the blade’s tip and spaced three inches apart, all facing the tip. The characters are carved in the style of the left-side script, beginning one and a half inches below the hilt. Such a sword, kept constantly between the bedding and comb of one’s sleeping place, never leaves the body, ensuring personal protection. It not only dispels evil spirits and myriad demons but also illuminates the five forms, enabling one to ascend as a flying immortal, the sword serving as one’s form.\n\nSome call it the \"Shadow-Dividing Sword,\" others the \"Divine Brandishing Blade.\" Its name is *Liang Fei*, its style *Zi Gan*. When sleeping, one should always invoke the sword’s name, saying: *\"Liang Fei, Zi Gan. Divine golden radiance, spirit of command, dispatch the hundred spirits, grant me long life, that no evil may harm me, and heaven and earth incline toward me.\"*\n\nThe characters carved on the back of the ring should descend toward the tip, carefully aligned to meet the edges on both sides. On the left side of the sword, the *ji* characters of the Dipper are carved, leaving the edge clear and following the hilt downward to meet the edges. On the right side, the same is done, with the *ji* characters of the Dipper aligned toward the spine and descending along the hilt to meet the edges. The star characters must be distinct and evenly distributed across the sword’s body, avoiding the blade’s edge. The star symbols should be round, carved like small rings, without piercing the solid iron at the ring’s center.\n\nExternally, the sword is wrapped in a blue-green silk cover. The stars are carved to resemble a screen ring, with the outer appearance of a ring but the interior solid. The raised half-ring at the center of the ring may be decorated according to personal taste. The blade is two feet four inches and seven *fen* long, the hilt two inches and seven *fen* long, and the tip nine inches, forming the double edges. The spine is three *fen* thick, and the blade one inch and four *fen* wide.\n\n**Proper Conduct When Relieving Oneself**\n\nThe Regulations state: All Daoist practitioners must know how to cultivate the body and respect their vestments. Before overcoming bodily impurities, one must observe proper conduct in all places. Daoist masters and female officials should first prepare a secluded area, its walls sealed with mud, inside and out kept immaculate, to avoid reproach or partiality from the two assemblies.\n\nWhen entering the privy, first remove the upper garment outside, then approach the door and recite the incantation:\n*\"Left Virtue Spirit, Right Virtue Spirit, Earth Controller of Life, Green Lady, remove my name from the register of death and let me enter the gate of life.\"*\nUpon completion, enter the privy. This serves three purposes: to honor the spirits of the vestments, to cultivate one’s own conduct, and to avoid offense to the two assemblies. A separate vessel of clean water and a clean towel should be placed beside the door. After cleansing, one may then don the garments.\n\nIf in the wilderness, recite:\n*\"Lady of the Wilds, Lady of the Wilds, remove my name from the register of death and let me enter the gate of life.\"*\n\nWhen urinating, recite:\n*\"Long Beard, Long Beard, let me enter the golden hall and jade chamber, grant me long life and old age, a hundred years, a thousand years, ever in your company.\"*\n\n**Dispelling Nightmares**\n\nThe Regulations state: All Daoist practitioners must know that the perfected ones of antiquity slept without dreaming and awoke without care. When the refinement of the mind is not yet pure, the six senses engage with the external world, the mind contends daily, and evil dreams are summoned.\n\nWhen Daoist priests, female officials, or lay followers—men and women alike—encounter nightmares, they should kneel facing north and invoke the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, recounting the dream’s details and beseeching the transformation of misfortune into fortune, calamity into blessing. Silently recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Perfected Jade Maidens, attend the true and guard the soul.\nThree Palaces’ Golden Lads, come and guard the Gate of Life.\nTransform evil into good, inscribe it above the Three Luminaries.\nGrant me long life, to ride the radiance and mount the clouds.\"*\n\nAfter reciting, swallow saliva seven times, click the teeth seven times, turn the pillow and lie down again. Thus, malevolent influences dissolve, and calamity is turned to blessing.\n\nIf the dream’s omen is extraordinary, take care not to speak of it to others. Silence brings fortune; discussion invites misfortune. Neither speaking nor discussing ensures ten thousand generations free from harm.\n\n**On Parents**\n\nThe Regulations state: All Daoist practitioners must understand that the Two Modes bestow life, and parents bequeath existence. Within the Dao of birth, one must know reverence and love.\n\nFor those who have left the household—Daoist priests and female officials—their bodies and minds adhere to the Dao, wholly severed from worldly customs. Yet in matters of nurture, they differ from ordinary laypeople.\n\nIf parents reside afar, visit them according to the four seasons; if nearby, pay respects at each month’s new moon. Whether in cold or heat, cool or warmth, observe the rites of inquiry.\n\nWhen seeing one’s household brothers in straitened circumstances, morning and night, with no means of support—if there are no brothers to provide—those who have left the household must discern their needs. They should reduce their own delicate provisions to supply them, ensuring no improper use outside the Dao.\n\nHousehold brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, and maternal kin are not subject to this rule. If one extends compassion beyond the Daoist precepts, and permission is granted, still, such provisions must not be used for non-Daoist purposes. One must not, on this account, share bed or seat, or eat from the same dish with parents, brothers, sisters, or close kin—whether inner or outer family.\n\nWhen removing the ritual robe, do not remain in the same place as the laity.\n\nIf parents fall ill, the heart of filial piety and fraternal love demands enduring hardship. One must diligently provide medicine and care, tending to them morning and night, sparing no effort for the parents who gave life.\n\nPresent parents are but temporary karmic connections; thus, we repay them with propriety, calling them \"parents.\" Never forget the debt of their nurture and upbringing.\n\n**On Old Age and Illness**\n\nThe Regulations state: All Daoist practitioners must understand that earthly existence arises from mixed karmic causes, yielding mixed karmic fruits. Across beginning, middle, and end, fortune and misfortune are not fixed.\n\nWhen Daoist priests or female officials contract illness—whether internal or external, mild or severe—unable to cultivate wisdom for self-benefit or wander to teach for others’ sake, they rely on twice-daily meals and four-seasonal clothing. With each thought, suffering clings; without support, the mind clings to form. There are two kinds of reliance:\n\n1. Reliance on six types of lay followers.\n2. Reliance on six types of Daoist companions.\n\nThe six types of lay followers are:\n1. Local venerable and virtuous persons.\n2. Local wealthy and noble persons.\n3. Local devout and faithful persons.\n4. One’s own parents.\n5. One’s own brothers.\n6. One’s own sisters.\n\nThe six types of Daoist companions are:\n1. One’s ordination master.\n2. One’s disciples.\n3. Fellow practitioners of the same teachings.\n4. Fellow practitioners of the same conduct.\n5. Those who share the same abode, whether senior or junior.\n6. Fellow practitioners of the same mind.\n\nThese twelve types of inner and outer companions, when faced with old age or illness, should generate five aspirations:\n1. May the two assemblies of the Dao be free from orphaned suffering.\n2. May the two assemblies of the Dao be free from fearful suffering.\n3. May the two assemblies of the Dao be free from hunger and cold.\n4. May the two assemblies of the Dao be free from longing and envy.\n5. May the two assemblies of the Dao be free from downfall and ruin.\n\nOnce these five aspirations are fulfilled, one should provide six kinds of support:\n1. Shelter according to means.\n2. Bedding according to means.\n3. Clothing and food according to means.\n4. Incense and lamps according to means.\n5. Water vessels and basins according to means.\n6. Attendants according to means.\n\nKnow that such a person, before attaining the Dao, through the three phases of existence—discarding and assuming bodies—will receive five exemptions from karmic retribution:\n1. Exemption from orphaned suffering.\n2. Exemption from fearful suffering.\n3. Exemption from hunger and cold.\n4. Exemption from longing and envy.\n5. Exemption from downfall and ruin.\n\nWhen the ill receive such support, according to their strength—whether walking, standing, sitting, or rising—they should cultivate twelve kinds of shame and reverence:\n1. Shame before the Celestial Worthy.\n2. Shame before the Perfected.\n3. Shame before the Immortals.\n4. Shame before the Lofty Heavens.\n5. Shame before the Vast Earth.\n6. Shame before the Sun and Moon.\n7. Shame before the venerable and virtuous.\n8. Shame before the wealthy and noble.\n9. Shame before the devout and faithful.\n10. Shame before parents.\n11. Shame before brothers.\n12. Shame before sisters.\n\nAspire that the shelter and provisions received may, while still in this body, dissolve suffering. May one attain the power of mental, physical, and verbal karma, and day and night, contemplate, praise, and bow in reverence. May the merit thus generated repay the kindness of those who came before, widely benefiting all karmic connections. May all be freed from illness and suffering, and the Dao’s gate be perfected.\n\nInner and outer practitioners, without lack or change, whether one, two, or countless in number, should compassionately ensure all receive and practice these teachings.\n\nIf, while practicing in a community, one is constrained by old age or illness and unable to personally receive offerings or [share with] companions, the six types of inner companions should, according to their means, receive them on their behalf.\n\n**On Transcendence**\n\nThe Regulations state: All Daoist practitioners must understand that in cultivating and establishing the gate of practice, there are distant and near paths. The distant path transcends the Three Realms; the near path attains long life and enduring vision.\n\nIf Daoist priests or nuns, without exception, are summoned by accumulated blessings, reverently bearing the Three Caverns’ scriptures, their rank equaling the Five Peaks, their caps and robes—whether of silk or coarse cloth—fashioned in the pattern of the Two Modes, they cultivate the enterprise of long life and study the Dao of true perfection. Some shed their forms in secret transformation; others, their lives ended, become ghostly officials. Thus, the Yellow Emperor ascended in transcendence, and the sword and crow remained; on Gaoqiu, the coffin was split open, and the body soared into the heavens. Therefore, the weight of the Dharma-body is such that neither death nor life can abandon it.\n\nWhen the ranks of immortality are not yet fulfilled and the time of passing arrives, at the hour of departure, they should bathe, comb their hair, don their caps and robes, and face the path of ascending to heaven, without calling back the hun-soul. Place them separately in a clean bamboo mat, spread with a pure mat, move them therein, and cover them with a light quilt. A staff is set to the left, a divine sword to the right; along the sides of the bier, pure grass is spread. Two kinds of disciples—inner and outer—stand to the left, while secular kin, men and women, stand to the right (if a nun, they are separated by a curtain). After the initial expression of grief, weeping follows at the proper times. At the head of the coffin, a case is placed to hold the external registers of the Dao.\n\nOne regulation states: The three registers are sealed and sent into a deep stone chamber, along with the requisite provisions—incense, medicines, clothing, brushes, inkstones, towels, and basins—along with all ritual implements, ensuring nothing is lacking. Gold, silver, and silk fabrics must not be used in excess. There are two kinds of burial chambers: one in the mountains and forests, the other in a high, secluded place.\n\n**On the Ritual Attire of Master and Disciple**\n\nThe Regulations state: All who study the Dao must understand that within our gate of practice, the bond between master and disciple is most weighty. Though the ultimate aim is to transcend death, in principle there should be no mourning rites. Yet, as the body is relinquished and received anew, there is the suffering of birth and decay.\n\nIf Daoist priests or nuns, or their inner disciples, change their attire to white caps and robes, weeping at the proper times, they should abstain from salt and sour foods for forty-nine days. After bathing, they resume their headscarves on the hundredth day, wearing pale yellow garments in a three-year period of heart-mourning. Outer disciples—those who have not resided with the master—change their attire to white caps and robes, weeping at the proper times, abstaining from salt and sour foods for twenty-one days. After bathing, they resume their headscarves, observing heart-mourning for three years.\n\nFor senior outer disciples, the rites follow those of outer disciples; for junior ones, they abstain from salt and sour foods for three days, for the master’s rank is not to be treated lightly. If the master has no secular heirs, only the disciples shall undertake the rites, leading one another in filial piety. With banners, flowers, towels, basins, incense, and ritual implements, they arrange the master’s repose. At the place of the funeral bier, a hundred-day fast is held before the rites conclude.\n\nIf the time is distant, and the master enters the stone chamber after the forty-nine days, another seven days of bathing and resuming headscarves follow. If the master weeps for a disciple, they abstain from salt and sour foods for seven days. After entering the chamber, they observe heart-mourning but do not change attire, for disciples vary in number, and individual rites cannot be prescribed for each. If fellow practitioners of the same aspiration and Dao send off a friend, they make slight changes to their caps and robes. After the usual entry into the chamber, a single day of mourning is observed.\n\nIf the deceased was of the same abbey, the community ceases musical offerings and conducts a hundred-day period of reverence.\n\n**On the Ritual Attire for Parents**\n\nThe Regulations state: All who study the Dao must understand that leaving the household and departing from the secular world is made possible by one’s parents, whose grace in giving life and nurturing is profound. Mourning cannot be absent, nor can grief be unexpressed; the rites must be observed in proper order.\n\nIf Daoist priests or nuns encounter the passing of grandparents, they observe a year-long mourning but must not approach the body in a separate room. They express grief through weeping for five days and do not receive condolences. For uncles and brothers, the rites are the same as for grandparents. If the burial has not yet occurred, they remain in mourning. For daughters-in-law and those of lower status, weeping in grief is not permitted. After the rites conclude, they bathe and resume their usual attire but must not adopt secular mourning garments. Those who violate this lose the Dao, incurring a penalty greater than the highest regulation.\n\nFor one’s own parents, weeping and expressing grief are permitted. After a hundred days of mourning, they resume their headscarves, change their garments to pale yellow, and observe heart-mourning for three years, without further weeping. If the time is distant, the rites follow those for a master, with a funeral bier set up. For distant relatives, small-funeral rites last five months, and fine-mourning rites last three months. For fellow travelers and companions met in journeying across the four seas, upon their death, participation in the burial is permitted. After the encoffining, one may visit to inquire, expressing sorrow and distress, but weeping is not allowed. Daoist law does not permit condolence visits, yet once one has entered the gate, it is unreasonable to abruptly refuse. These are the worldly regulations of the *Lingbao* scriptures.\n\n**On Merit for the Deceased**\n\nThe Regulations state: All who study the Dao must understand that when a master or ancestor passes, both inner and outer disciples, in performing merit for the deceased, follow the same rites, though their financial means may differ. From the day of receiving the teachings, one serves five or six masters. If the officiant’s resources are exhausted, three merit-retreat fasts are held.\n\nAfter a hundred days, a fivefold *Lian Shengshi* fast is established, lasting three days and nights, conducted beside the chamber of repose. If the chamber is nearby, it may also be held within the abbey. On the anniversary of the passing, a *Huanglu* fast is held; if impoverished, a *Lingbin* fast suffices. On the monthly anniversary, a fast is conducted according to one’s means.\n\nThe first is to repay the master-ancestor’s wisdom; the second, to repay the master’s provision of clothing and food; the third, to repay the master-ancestor’s protection; the fourth, to repay the master’s grace in leaving the secular world. If a disciple, upon the master-ancestor’s passing, does not grieve deeply or perform merit to pursue blessings, they commit the sin of unfiliality and incur four kinds of evil retribution: first, present disciples will abandon them; second, past disciples will turn their backs on them; third, future disciples will forsake them. Each should apply their heart, ensuring three generations of remembrance, mutually guiding and delivering one another. Be warned and be cautious.\n\n**On the Property of the Deceased**\n\nThe Regulations state: All who study the Dao must understand that cultivating the body and delivering the mind, maintaining an empty hall and a pure chamber, is the way of the immortals’ household.\n\nIf Daoist priests or nuns, whether for the needs of merit or for sustenance, whether obtained through practicing the Dao and kept in their rooms or stored elsewhere, pass away before using them, their scriptures, abbey treasures, memorial texts, and miscellaneous writings are to be distributed among their inner disciples. Their mounts, attendants, and any possessions, even a single item, are likewise to be allocated.\n\nUpon completion of the offerings, all shall be incorporated into the permanent endowment of the resident abbey.\n\nFirst, for the abiding assembly’s field of blessings across kalpas;\nsecond, for the inner and outer assemblies of other regions’ fields of blessings across kalpas;\nthird, for the three generations of the lay patrons’ fields of blessings across kalpas.\n\nThe custodians of the dharma-gate, together with the resident assembly, shall personally inspect and record, ensuring no negligence or oversight, lest it become a field of transgressions for the inner and outer assemblies and the three generations.\n\nIf the deceased had made prior arrangements, follow the departed master’s written instructions. If not of this abbey—whether near or far—wherever the body lies, the abbey shall proportionately bear the funeral expenses, including incense and lamp oil, with the remainder to be handled as stipulated above.\n\nFor those from beyond a thousand *li*, follow the regulations of the nearest dharma-gate’s permanent endowment.\n\n*Dongxuan Lingbao Daoist Regulations and Rituals, Concluded.*",

      "translated_text": "***Codes of Daoist Studies from the Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure***\n**Volume the Upper**\n**The Supreme Ultimate and Grand Void Perfected Person**\n\n**Chapter on Speech**\nThe Code states: In all Daoist studies, one must understand the urgency and gravity of pivotal matters. Speech, whether good or evil, invites misfortune or fortune—all arising from the karma of the mouth. Those who have left the household life, whether Daoist priests or female Daoist adepts, when residing in chambers or abbeys and engaging in discourse with venerable masters of great virtue, must inquire and deliberate with deference. They should speak in gentle tones and with humility, heeding the words of their venerable masters. If their intent is not yet fulfilled or the Dao’s principles remain unclear, they ought to wait until the master has fully expressed their counsel before gradually resolving matters. They must not disrupt the assembly with personal biases or leave their words in disarray. Even if their inner disposition is not malicious, such conduct will invite external reproach. Whether minor or major matters, discord will arise: first, the inner assembly will slander them; second, the outer assembly will slander them.\n\nWhen among fellow practitioners of the Dao, whether peers of similar age or seniors addressing juniors, or juniors engaging with seniors, all discussions—whether concerning communal affairs or personal matters—must be conducted with a composed mind and measured speech, ensuring the principles are thoroughly expounded. They must not raise their voices or startle the inner and outer assemblies, nor disregard the respect due to masters, fellow Daoists, or laypersons, nor bring shame upon parents, siblings, or clan kin.\n\nWhether in chambers or among disciples, when speaking one’s mind or uttering words, all should revolve around proper matters, engaging in doctrinal inquiry and response. The wise should be consulted, and the ignorant should be instructed, so that wisdom may grow ever brighter while ignorance daily diminishes. Though one may speak all day, if it aligns with the Dao, no hardship will arise.\n\nWhen addressing outsiders, relatives of the six relations, or any men and women, if discussing inquiries about well-being, seasonal changes, or mundane affairs that cannot be avoided, one may do so. Beyond this, however, one must not engage in improper or frivolous speech. Though worldly folk may delight in such discourse, it is unsuited to those who have left the household life—beware of uttering it.\n\nA single word that brings great misfortune is deemed excessive speech of the highest degree. A single word that invites humiliation is excessive speech of the middle degree. A single word that leads to ruin is excessive speech of the lowest degree. The speech of ancient and modern sages and worthies, though their words and phrases fill the space between heaven and earth, was still deemed insufficient. The world took them as models and never wearied of their words. Thus, good words are never excessive, and evil words are never few.\n\nThe ancients, when about to speak, reflected deeply, and their words became scriptures, established as models for humanity. The foolish, however, speak recklessly, bringing calamity upon themselves, ultimately harming their own being—this is a grave admonition.\n\n**Chapter on Study and Recitation**\nThe Code states: In all Daoist studies, one must understand that listening, learning, and dedicating merit require an enlightened master. If the master is unenlightened, it will instead harm one’s wisdom of the Dao.\n\nWhether Daoist priests or female officials, those who dwell in the gate of the Dao and aspire to profound awakening must abandon seven kinds of attachments: first, attachment to companionship; second, attachment to wine and lust; third, attachment to fame and profit; fourth, attachment to frivolous play; fifth, attachment to arts and music; sixth, attachment to food and drink; seventh, attachment to cities and markets.\n\nHaving abandoned these attachments, one should cultivate four kinds of aspirations to encounter a master: first, the aspiration to meet an enlightened master, regardless of distance; second, the aspiration to meet an enlightened master, regardless of poverty or wealth; third, the aspiration to meet an enlightened master, regardless of affection or aversion; fourth, the aspiration to meet an enlightened master, regardless of nobility or humility.\n\nFrom the first thought to the second, and onward to many thoughts; from the first moment to the second, and onward to many moments, one must drive the body and mind as if starving or parched, inquiring into subtle truths. Through hearing, contemplation, practice, and realization, one extols the merits and virtues, ensuring the flourishing of the mysterious transformation, so that neither assembly falls into confusion or suffering.\n\nIf among the female Daoist assembly, where the nature is timid and no one in their position can instruct, they should gather in groups of three, five, or more, purify their three karmas, prepare their ritual implements, and receive the scriptural texts. They should draw near to a great master, visiting once or twice a day, then returning to their proper place.\n\nIf there is no female Daoist abbey near the master’s dwelling, they should seek residence in a devout household near the master’s abode, where they may perform morning rites, recite scriptures, and receive instruction as prescribed by the Code. They must maintain proper conduct in body, speech, and mind, transmitting teachings at the proper times. They must not violate the Code in their practice of the Dao, lest they provoke reproach from the inner and outer assemblies in both action and stillness, thereby corrupting the true and pure gate of the Dao.\n\nThose who transgress will invite harm, humiliation, and karmic retribution, falling outside the ranks of the pure. Their progress in the Dao and practice of rituals must be carefully assessed.\n\nIf the two assemblies share a karmic connection, the great master should perform the ritual. If the two assemblies have separate karmic connections, each may perform their own rituals.\n\n**Chapter on Prohibiting Wine**\nThe Code states: In all Daoist studies, one must understand that upholding precepts cultivates wisdom, stabilizes the body, and refines the mind, free from the delusion of wine’s evils.\n\nThose who seek tranquility and mindfulness—whether Daoist priests or female Daoist adepts—who enter the gate of the Dao are true children of the Dao. Those who indulge in wine at any of the twelve hours commit ten kinds of confusion and disorder: first, disobedience to masters and venerable elders, or to parents among outsiders; second, burdening disciples or the wives and children of outsiders; third, quarreling with fellow students or the brothers of outsiders; fourth, violating royal law; fifth, offending friends; sixth, falling from mounts; seventh, burning or drowning in fire or water; eighth, losing the way; ninth, suddenly losing mindfulness and wisdom; tenth, generating coarse behavior in the presence of circumstances.\n\nThese ten evils cause both the inner and outer assemblies, in the moment or afterward, to become mentally and physically confused, like those afflicted with madness. They lose awareness of time and fail to distinguish between inner and outer, shattering the twofold contemplation, disrupting the order of the mind, and destroying the three virtues. Their conduct and transformation lose all foundation.\n\nThey will constantly associate with three kinds of people: first, those who cultivate evil karma; second, those who consume flesh and blood; third, those who slaughter living beings.\n\nThey will also befriend five kinds of companions: first, those who distance themselves from parents and are unfilial; second, those who indulge in lust without restraint and defy propriety; third, those who ruin their families and lose their livelihoods, having no plan; fourth, those who violate codes and laws, stealing; fifth, those who are greedy for worldly pleasures and unsuited to the Dao.",

      "translated_text": "Day after day, month after month, year after year, they fail to collect their thoughts, lose their origin, and depart from their lineage. Before their eyes, they encounter six kinds of abandonment: first, abandonment by their master and preceptor; second, abandonment by their parents; third, abandonment by their brothers; fourth, abandonment by their sisters; fifth, abandonment by their friends; sixth, abandonment by their inner assembly. All these causes and conditions constitute the karmic retribution of the present life, bound to the treasure of the master.\n\nWhen expounding the Dharma in turn, one must repeatedly declare: having no prior close associates and no prior companions is the supreme method of cultivation—this is true renunciation. If old or ill, one may take medicine according to one’s portion; but if one exceeds this in greed and competition, it is the same as the present-life retribution.\n\n**Avoiding Pungent and Acrid Foods**\nThe precepts state: All Dao learners must know to cultivate the body and purify the mind without violating prohibitions. Whether Daoist priests or female Daoists, consuming the five pungent and acrid foods—called \"evil vegetables\"—is internally and externally unlawful and must not be transgressed. What are the five? First, leeks; second, garlic; third, scallions; fourth, onions; fifth, Chinese chives.\n\nMoreover, among all vegetables, those that are pungent in the present moment bring four kinds of harm and lack three kinds of share. What are the four? First, harm to the five viscera; second, harm to Dao cultivation; third, harm to the inner assembly; fourth, harm to the outer assembly. What are the three shares they lack? First, no share in ascending to the Dao altar; second, no share in invoking the divine spirits; third, no share in transforming men and women.\n\nOne must collect the three karmas: let not the mind seek, let not the body pursue, let not the mouth consume. Then the divine spirits may be hoped for, the Dao altar may be ascended, men and women may be transformed, the viscera will be clear and at peace, the breath will be fragrant and pure, morning and evening audiences will be held, the dwelling will be empty and open, responses will be felt, and blessings will descend, benefiting all conditions.\n\n**Regulations on Robes and Attire**\nThe precepts state: All Dao learners must know that upon entering the Dao, one removes worldly thoughts within and severs worldly ties without, inwardly guarding the Dharma gate and outwardly cultivating Dharma robes. Those who have renounced the household—whether Daoist priests or female Daoists—whether dwelling in the mountains for self-cultivation or traveling among people to transform them, must have proper standards for their inner and outer Dharma robes.\n\nFor those newly renounced who have not yet received the inner registers, the upper robe of immortal brown and the Dharma cloak should both have a number of strips, but not twenty-four. Upon receiving the *Five Thousand Words of Divine Incantations*, one must wear twenty-four strips, corresponding to the twenty-four qi. For those aged twenty-five and above who receive the *Dongshen Lingbao Dadong*, the upper robe of immortal brown should have thirty-two strips, modeling the thirty-two heavens, the honored among the heavens; the Dharma cloak should have twenty-eight strips, modeling the twenty-eight constellations, the spirits among the constellations. Twenty-four strips are also permissible.\n\nAccording to the body of Dao cultivation, the robes should extend one foot below the knee, with central yellow as the standard color. For those practicing the supreme method, purple is permitted. Those of lesser years or rank should not wear purple. For the inner robe and Dharma shirt, whether with straight or wide sleeves, they should be made of yellow or other light, pure colors, all with large collars crossing downward to cover six inches above the heart over the inner robe. For the inner robe and Dharma skirt, other light or dark colors may be used for the lining, with yellow as the outer layer. If patterned, light colors may be used for the outer layer, all extending to the ankles.\n\nFor female Daoists who possess the supreme method, light purple gauze may be used for the brown robe; if wearing a skirt, deep yellow must be used, and no other light colors may be employed. The upper, middle, and lower robes must not be calculated by the inner or outer edges—all should be made with wide hems sewn on, without personal insistence, to avoid being嫌 by the two assemblies: first, incurring the slander of the common world; second, incurring the slander of other paths. The true spirits will depart the body, lust and deviance will arise within, one will be unable to maintain inner purity, the Three Corpses will lurk in hiding, the Red Child will take flight, one will be forever parted from the mysterious chamber, the form will dissolve, the bones will unravel, the body will die, and the name will perish.\n\nIf one’s cap and robes always accord with the Dao, on the day of attaining the Dao, the Heavenly Emperor will bestow upon you the *Nine-Light Brocade Cloak of Li Luo*, the *Cinnabar-Silk Radiant Headscarf*, the *Heavenly Treasure Girdle*, and *Lion-Patterned Shoes*—called the *Attire of the Flying Immortals*—to reward the virtue of those who have accumulated merit through diligent seeking of the Dao. Do not covet the caps and crowns of the worldly, nor slight the robes of the Dao. Though the world may regard them as lowly and honorable, they do not escape death; the Dao learner’s headscarf and cloak accord with the heavens above. Wearing them to seek the Dao enables one to become a flying immortal riding the void.\n\n**Regulations on Headscarves and Caps**\nThe precepts state: All Dao learners must know that to be complete in dignity and have all matters settled, with a reputation and conduct beyond the common, is to be one who has renounced the household. Those who have renounced the household, when wearing the headscarf and cap of the highest rank, must know their symbolic forms and their uses.\n\nWhether Daoist priests or female Daoists, in ordinary cultivation, they wear the *Two Principles Headscarf*, which has two corners, modeling the Two Principles. When performing rituals and ascending the altar of the Three Registers’ communal fast, they wear the *Primordial Beginning’s Far-Wandering Cap*, or the supreme method of the *Light Ramie Headscarf*, which the Primordial Beginning wears. Thus, the heavenly perfected and upper sages may wear the *Nine Virtues Headscarf* or the *Seven Stars Headscarf*—that is, a cap and headscarf with the pattern of the seven stars—also called the *Mysterious Cap*. \"Mysterious\" refers to heaven, and heaven is also said to have seven stars.\n\nDao learners must always wear the hairpin and cap when lying down, sitting, or resting, so that the divine spirits may be revered and served, and not be temporarily set aside, lest the *Niwan* and *Xuanhua* spirits bear resentment. Only when combing and arranging the *Xuanhua* in the morning may it be temporarily set aside and placed on a clean headscarf. Moreover, it must not be exposed to the outer assembly of men and women or those not of the same covenant, nor lightly taken or played with.\n\nThose who are cautious in this regard gain five benefits: first, their own body is honored and respected; second, they avoid offenses with the outer assembly; third, they receive the praise of the true spirits; fourth, they inspire sentient beings to generate goodness; fifth, they increase the inner and outer fields of merit.",

      "translated_text": "Those who fail to guard and revere their headscarves and caps, allowing outsiders to recklessly take and toy with them, incur five kinds of karmic retribution for Dao learners: first, their own person is held in contempt and ridiculed; second, they cause outsiders to commit the sin of disrespect; third, the true spirits reproach them, and their Dao qi scatters and flees; fourth, sentient beings lose reverence; fifth, they incur guilt both inwardly and outwardly. Dao learners of both sexes must be clearly mindful and cautious, thereby generating the five benefits and extinguishing the five retributions.\n\nThrough this reverence for others, the sprouts of goodness grow; do not allow disdain for others to rot the roots of goodness. Thus, those of the outer world will respect our great Dharma and not slander or mock it—each must be vigilant in this regard.\n\n**Respect for Dharma Attire**\n\nIt is decreed: All Dao learners must know that upon entering the Dao, their upper, middle, and lower garments are all to be honored and respected, never treated with negligence or contempt. For those who have left the household life—whether Daoist priests or female Daoist adepts—their upper robe and cloak are most worthy of reverence. Why? Because the Heavenly Worthy and the sages all wear this same attire. As for the middle and lower garments, they assist our Dharma rituals; following the upper robe, they connect with the numinous through Dharma attire. Thus, the world honors them, distinguishing them from the common stream. If one treats them with disdain, one incurs guilt as the occasion arises.\n\nThe signs of reverence arise from five causes:\n1. Before donning them, store them in a case or box, placing them in a high, clean location;\n2. After donning them, whether sitting or rising, always keep them clean;\n3. When temporarily removing them, do not place them with secular clothing;\n4. Even among fellow learners of the same covenant, do not exchange them;\n5. Do not beg or borrow them from secular people for improper use; until they are worn out, keep them clean and burn them when discarding.\n\nThose who violate this incur guilt for both themselves and others. Those who revere Dharma attire gain five true causes of honor:\n1. Truly, through Dharma attire, they gain honor and need not bow in submission to outsiders, men or women;\n2. Truly, through Dharma attire, they gain honor, inspiring outsiders, men and women, to bow in reverence;\n3. Truly, through Dharma attire, they gain honor, and wherever they travel, clothing and food come to them unsought, receiving offerings;\n4. Truly, through Dharma attire, they gain honor, and through inner cultivation and outer submission, they connect with the luminous spirits;\n5. Truly, through Dharma attire, they gain honor, and outsiders—men, women, kings, princes, and emperors—hear of them and rejoice, harboring no ill will.\n\nWhat are the five causes of disdain?\n1. Before donning them, leaving them overturned and scattered in low, filthy places;\n2. After donning them, leaning or sitting anywhere without distinguishing clean from unclean;\n3. When temporarily removing them, mixing them with secular clothing;\n4. Exchanging them casually with those not of the same learning or Dharma;\n5. Begging or borrowing them from secular people for improper use.\n\nIn this life, such people receive five true retributions for their disdain:\n1. Truly, through disdain, they are held in contempt, reduced to the level of common folk, and must bow to others;\n2. Truly, through disdain, they are held in contempt and do not receive bows of reverence from men or women;\n3. Truly, through disdain, they are held in contempt, and wherever they travel, they do not receive timely clothing or food;\n4. Truly, through disdain, they are held in contempt, and through inner cultivation and outer submission, the spirits do not descend;\n5. Truly, through disdain, they are held in contempt, and outsiders—men, women, kings, princes, and emperors—hear of them or see them and feel no faith or reverence.\n\nDao learners of both sexes must thoughtfully honor and respect, never treating lightly to invite calamity and trouble. If garments are already worn out and unfit for wear, on an elimination day at dawn, after paying respects, burn them in a clean place, ensuring outsiders—men and women—do not casually see them.\n\nFor those who wear the Three Garments of true scriptures, whether lying down, sitting, or resting, they must not expose their heads; they must wear a headscarf or cap, and not expose their form; they must wear clothing.\n\n**Turning Away from the Dao**\n\nIt is decreed: All Dao learners must know that from the beginning of primordial qi to the attainment of the Dao, passing through the eight difficulties and suffering, they receive the body of one who has left the household life. Through the Dharma attire of our divine immortals, the robes of the Three Treasures, the immortal’s coarse robe and Dharma cloak, the upper, middle, and lower garments—all bearing symbolic meaning—by embodying the Dharma, they gain honor.\n\nWhether Daoist priests or female Daoist adepts, by the grace of the sovereign, their parents, and their masters, they attain the position of leaving the household life. They must make offerings to their masters and teachers, thereby escaping two kinds of prisons:\n1. **Inner prisons**, which entail lighter suffering: the prisons of parents, spouses, sons and daughters, brothers, sisters, social status, and internal and external relations. Within these, there are two kinds: first, the prison of joy, with bonds of affection and pleasures; second, the prison of anger, with oppression and suffering. Though joy and suffering differ, the prison remains the same.\n2. **Outer prisons**, which entail grave sins: prisons jointly created by parents, spouses, sons and daughters, brothers, sisters, social status, and internal and external relations. Within these, there are also two kinds: first, the prison of affliction, with both desired and undesired actions; second, the prison of joy, with harmonious and mutual desires. Though affliction and joy differ, the joint creation remains the same.\n\nToday, having left the household life, one escapes the four former conditions, vowing to endure hardship until attaining the Dao. When sitting in the Dao realm, one returns to teach and transform. If, before attaining realization, one turns against the true Dharma, generating even a single thought to cast off the Daoist robe and seek worldly pleasures, such a person immediately incurs three kinds of karmic retribution:\n1. They do not obtain an ill appearance, ill lifespan, ill reputation, or ill qi; they suffer themselves, and others view them with disgust...",

      "translated_text": "Second, they suffer untimely calamities—yearly, monthly, daily, or hourly—where others commit sins yet they bear the consequences. Third, they incur wind-borne afflictions and leprosy; if they bear sons or daughters, these children are born deaf, blind, mute, or crippled, or may be seized by royal law, executed while alive. Once their evil exhausts the body, they repay the Three Officials, enduring the five hues and ninefold depths of darkness. All instruments of suffering stretch endlessly; the vastness of their form surpasses even the five-colored realms. Compared to the five-colored heavens, their karmic suffering fills the ninefold dark abodes, spanning kalpas uncounted without respite, even as this world’s heaven and earth endure. When the kalpic winds and waters arrive, they are swept to other realms, where amid dissolution they still suffer. Should an eternal kalpa pass, even if parents, siblings, children, sisters, relatives of high or low station, or friends—whether through self-reflection, shared remembrance, sequential thought, thoughts of food and drink, thoughts of wealth, thoughts of oppression, or thoughts of humiliation—induce an ordained one to cast off the Dharma robe, turn from the Dao, and follow worldly ways, know that such a person has, for kalpas beyond measure, rotted their good roots and grown their evil roots, destroying the treasure of the Dao, the treasure of the scriptures, and the treasure of the masters. Today, harboring great evil, they break and defile the Three Treasures’ field of merit, their original vows of renunciation arising from faith, their present retreat arising from slander. With faith’s root destroyed, the fire of slander burns them; having earned these sufferings, they are clearly warned within and without: strive diligently in cultivation, each seeking liberation.\n\n**Dwelling in the Mountains**\nThe section states: All Daoist learners should understand that the Dao’s propagation and the sages’ establishment of methods guide beginners to withdraw into mountain forests. Those who leave the household—whether Daoist priests or female Daoist adepts—should dwell in the mountains to seek quiet contemplation, avoiding common worldly interactions, preserving their life essence, shunning desires, and departing from defilement and disorder. The mountain-dwelling system differs from the world’s in ten matters of cause and condition:\n1. They must not register households to convert others;\n2. They must not associate with the noble and powerful to seek fame and profit;\n3. They must not practice heterodox spells or incantations;\n4. They must not accept money for medicine or divination, maintaining separation from the world;\n5. They must not share beds or seats with secular women, except for those of other teachings who dwell in the mountains with purity;\n6. At dawn, midday, sunset, during the hour of settling the mind, and at midnight when the cock crows, they should burn incense, light lamps, and pay reverence to the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions, repenting transgressions and eliminating evil. When paying reverence, begin with the east;\n7. After midday, they must not consume grains or qi-bearing substances. Non-grain substances—such as water, jade, mushrooms, stones, pine, wood, Solomon’s seal, cloud essence, *lingfei* powder, and *gouji*—may be consumed at any time and are not prohibited;\n8. When traversing mountains to gather herbs, take three steps and snap the fingers once; take ten steps and strike the chime once. With every step, constantly contemplate the Dao, imagining divine beings on cliffs and roadsides bestowing immortal arts, so that through cultivation and ingestion, one ascends to heaven in broad daylight;\n9. If one attains the Dao in small measure but has not yet fully realized it, do not display it arrogantly or belittle those who have not;\n10. Always remember the kindness of one’s parents in raising and nurturing the body.\n\nThese ten matters are the essentials of dwelling in the mountains to cultivate the Dao. Methods of ingestion and regulation are fully set forth in the original text.\n\n**Hair Care**\nThe section states: All Daoist learners should know that cultivating the body follows specific methods. The head is the Mysterious Flower; when combed and arranged properly, it preserves essence and prevents the hundred illnesses. Those who leave the household—whether Daoist priests or female Daoist adepts—should, whether inside or outside the abode, each prepare a clean comb and store it in a box. At cock’s crow, rise early and, before performing rites, face north, turn toward the direction of one’s natal star, wash the hands, and comb the hair. If the person is not a fellow student or of like mind, do not let them see or borrow the comb. After combing, proceed to the rites; if duties press urgently, combing may follow the rites. When combing, frequent strokes prevent blood stagnation and pain. After combing, recite the secret incantation in silence:\n*The Supreme Emperor scatters numinous power; the Five Elders return the spirit.\nThe Mysterious Flower of the Mud Pill preserves essence and ensures longevity.\nOn the right, the moon is concealed; on the left, the sun’s root is drawn.\nThe Six Harmonies are purified; the hundred spirits receive grace.*\nIf one fails to comb at the proper time, the two spirits grow resentful and do not support diligent practice. The first is the spirit of the Mysterious Flower; the second is the spirit of the Mud Pill. In the world, four kinds of self-harm prevent combing:\n1. Those resembling people burdened by worldly toil, unable to comb;\n2. Those resembling people afflicted by severe illness, unable to comb;\n3. Those resembling people with broken or severed fingers, unable to comb;\n4. Those resembling people who have retreated and become indolent, lacking the Dao, unable to comb.\nLearners should revere the two spirits and avoid the four harms. Female Daoist adepts must not imitate secular people, neglecting proper methods for vain and false practices, adorning their heads with gold, silver, copper, or iron, thereby incurring the dislike of both inner and outer assemblies. Though they harm no one, they bring disgrace upon themselves. After combing, if loose hairs remain, place them in a clean container for one, two, or up to nine days, then burn them in a clean place, ensuring neither inner nor outer assemblies see them.\n\n**Bathing**\nThe section states: All Daoist learners should know that the wise body is flawless, the enlightened mind a bright mirror; all dust and filth belong to this embodied self. Those who leave the household—whether Daoist priests or female Daoist adepts—when the mind clings to conditions and inner dust arises, should wash and bathe with the water of mindfulness, moment by moment.",

      "translated_text": "Since the body is dependent on external conditions and thus accumulates outer dust, it should be bathed with fragrant water at all times. The body’s acquisition of dust and filth through external conditions arises from four causes:\n\nFirst, the body serves as a field of merit—when managing ritual halls or receiving offerings, it gathers the dust of human effort.\nSecond, rising and sitting through the six periods of the day, it collects the dust of empty space.\nThird, attending to obligations and performing rites, it gathers the dust of past causes.\nFourth, failing to distinguish purity from impurity, it accumulates the dust of contact.\n\nThese habits cause Daoist learners to accumulate grime, leaving both upper and lower parts unclean. As a result, neither the inner nor outer assemblies feel inclined to take refuge, the deities of the four quarters withhold their power, and all petitions fail to summon divine illumination.\n\nAccording to the *Scripture of the Venerable Lord of the Cavernous Dao*, one should use the Five Fragrances method: green sandalwood, vitex blossoms, lemongrass, orchid, and true sandalwood. Prepare them in whatever quantity is available, finely chopping and boiling them until the fragrant water is ready. Both assemblies should then bathe in the scented water. If Daoist learners encounter times or places where these are unavailable, they may use whatever fragrant materials are at hand.\n\nThe methods of bathing include general days, specific days, inner assemblies, and outer assemblies.\n\n**Specific Days:**\nThe tenth day of the first month, the eighth day of the second month, the sixth day of the third month, the fourth day of the fourth month, the first day of the fifth month, the twenty-seventh day of the sixth month, the fifteenth day of the seventh month, the twenty-second day of the eighth month, the twentieth day of the ninth month, the eighteenth day of the tenth month, the fifteenth day of the eleventh month, and the twelfth day of the twelfth month. On these days, one should lodge by the Eastern Well, bathe in fragrant water, lightening the body and perfuming the form to attain longevity and unimpeded vitality.\n\nBefore bathing, first knock the teeth three times and recite the secret incantation:\n*\"The Four Great open and radiant, heaven and earth endure as constant.\nMystic water washes away filth, dispelling inauspiciousness.\nTwin youths guard the gate, the Seven Spirits secure the chamber.\nCloudy streams refine and cleanse, the ten thousand qi harmonize in health.\nInner and outer flourish in integrity, preserving this yellow robe.\nMorning and evening, in washing and rinsing, employ this method.\"*\n\nThe bathing chamber should be situated in a secluded corner of the dwelling, its interior and exterior sealed with clay to prevent those bathing from glimpsing the forms of the sun, moon, or stars. Even among fellow learners or companions, one should enter the chamber in sequence, never allowing mutual sight.\n\n**General Days:**\nWhen summoning both inner and outer assemblies on the same day, two secluded chambers should be arranged within the abbey, sufficiently distant to prevent the sound of voices or washing water from being heard. On the eighth day of the twelfth month, as the year draws to a close, boil whatever fragrant materials are available to prepare the water, adjusting the temperature appropriately. The master should place a talisman into the fragrant water, then allow men and women to bathe separately in chambers proportionate to their numbers.\n\n---\n\n**Dispelling Filth**\n\nThe section states: All Daoist learners should know that as they wander mountains and marshes or guide beings in the world, those who have left the household—whether Daoist priests or female Daoist adepts—encounter five kinds of filth that cannot be instantly avoided:\n\n1. **Self-inflicted filth:** In walking, standing, sitting, or rising, blood may suddenly rain from the empty sky in greater or lesser amounts, staining the head, face, hands, feet, or robes. Or crows, magpies, or storks may carry corpses—whole or in parts—dropping them unexpectedly before one. This is called self-inflicted filth.\n\n2. **Incidental filth:** While traversing mountains to gather herbs or teaching in the world, one may encounter corpses on winding paths, see the dead in the grass, or witness lewd acts or other impure sights. These are not sought but unexpectedly seen, and are called incidental filth.\n\n3. **Self-sought filth:** Through familiarity with worldly ties, financial dealings, or visits to the homes of relatives and friends after deaths, one may willingly attend funerals or condolence calls without external compulsion. This is called self-sought filth.\n\n4. **Filth of power and status:** When officials of secular power or rank experience deaths in their households, pressure from superiors and subordinates may force one to attend, despite fear of reprimand or personal reluctance. Bowing in grief before the deceased, one sees the corpse. This is called the filth of power and status.\n\n5. **Filth of association:** When laywomen or livestock such as cattle, horses, donkeys, mules, pigs, sheep, or dogs give birth, one may wish to see or personally observe the impure scene. This is called the filth of association.\n\nThose who encounter filth should not participate in ritual petitions or fasts. Instead, take bamboo leaves and peach branches, along with whatever fragrant materials are available, boil them in pure water, and place the liquid in a large basin. Then draw a talisman and cast it into the basin. If the filth encountered is severe, one should bathe; if minor, one may simply wash.\n\nBefore dispelling filth, knock the teeth three times and recite the secret incantation:\n*\"The Four Great open and radiant, heaven and earth endure as constant.\nMystic water washes away filth, dispelling inauspiciousness.\nTwin youths guard the gate, the Seven Spirits secure the chamber.\nCloudy streams refine and cleanse, the ten thousand qi harmonize in health.\nInner and outer flourish in integrity, preserving this yellow robe.\"*\n\nIf hosting a communal fast or lecture and fearing that members of the outer assembly—men or women—may have encountered filth, place a large basin filled with talismanic water at the main gate. Instruct all who enter to wash their eyes before proceeding to hear the Dharma.\n\n---\n\n**Bells and Chimes**\n\nThe section states: All Daoist learners should know that to enter the realm of the Middle Way is to awaken the mind-king, identical yet not different. Among those who have left the household—whether Daoist priests or female Daoist adepts—some may practice divergent methods before their fellow Daoists. There are five types of such individuals:\n\n1. Those who refine elixirs for livelihood,\n2. Those who administer external medicines to heal,\n3. Those who undertake construction to establish merit,\n4. Those who consume medicinal foods to cultivate the body,\n5. Those who cultivate wisdom to liberate beings.\n\nDuring scripture recitation, ritual fasts, Daoist practices, or the establishment of Dharma rites to receive offerings, without bells and chimes to alert and summon the assembly, each may follow their own path, arriving at different times or not at all. Thus, the *Scripture of the Middle Prime* states:\n*\"In the long fast at the Mystic Capital, jade is struck and chimes of nephrite resound.\nThe Ten Flowers gather the immortals, purple mists congeal into a palace.\"*",

      "translated_text": "At the left front platform of the ritual hall, bells and chimes shall be hung and struck at the appointed times. This not only alerts and gathers the assembly but also moves the host of spirits. During the six periods of the day, practitioners must fasten their sashes and maintain solemnity, striking the mallet with proper form—first dense, then gradually sparse, totaling eight strikes. After a second dense sequence, wait until the incense fire is prepared, then begin again with dense strikes, gradually thinning to twelve. Once more, strike densely, increasing to twelve, then conclude with two final dense sequences of twelve strikes each. If summoning the assembly requires a slower pace, follow it without disrupting the timing.\n\nWhen the bell tolls, five timely benefits arise:\n1. The assembly gathers for ritual without delay,\n2. Purity is received at the proper hour,\n3. The collective resolve is roused without delay,\n4. Evil thoughts are dispelled without delay,\n5. Distinct good intentions arise without delay.\n\nThe cessation of wrongdoing and the practice of virtue truly depend on the bells and chimes. Their aid sustains diligent effort, and success lies in mindful application. They urge the six periods of the day toward progress, guiding one straight to the Daoist sanctuary. Let them not instead cause the six periods to regress, returning one to the paths of evil. This is proclaimed for future generations.\n\nFor both inner and outer assemblies, harmonizing great vows involves two causes:\n1. Harmonizing personal vows,\n2. Harmonizing communal vows.\n\nWhether undertaken privately or collectively, whether heard privately or collectively, one must advance with diligence in upholding and practicing them.\n\n**Section on Fasting Rituals**\nAll Daoist practitioners must know what to cultivate—whether in mind or in deed—with fasting and stillness as the foundation, the root of virtue, and the basis of seeking the Dao. For Daoists and female adepts, fasting is required for:\n- Reciting scriptures,\n- Collating scriptures,\n- Inscribing talismans,\n- Compounding medicines,\n- Refining the Golden Elixir,\n- Deep contemplation,\n- Seeking instruction from a master,\n- Prostrations,\n- Receiving scriptures,\n- Salvation and disaster relief,\n- Attaining the True.\n\nThe Most High reveres it; Lord Lao protects it; all sages rely upon it. There are many fasting methods, depending on the practitioner’s chosen path:\n- Register Initiation Morning Rites,\n- *Five Thousand Characters* Morning Rites,\n- *Lingbao* Morning Rites,\n- *Shangqing* Morning Rites,\n- *Three Sovereigns* Morning Rites,\n- Upper Prime Fasting for Elixir Refinement and Immortality,\n- Middle Prime Fasting for Self-Cultivation and Atonement,\n- Lower Prime Fasting for Deliverance of the Nine Ancestors,\n- Eight Emperors Fasting,\n- Three-Five Grand Fasting,\n- Lower Prime Thirty-Two Heavens Fasting,\n- Middle Prime Invocation of the Seventy-Two Lords Fasting,\n- Upper Prime Six Direct Fasting,\n- *Lingbao* Golden Register Fasting for Deliverance of Lords and Kings,\n- Yellow Register Fasting for Salvation of the Nine Ancestors,\n- Illuminating the True Fasting for Self-Cultivation,\n- Three Primes Fasting for Atonement,\n- *Lingbao* Natural Fasting for Worldly Engagement,\n- Mud and Charcoal Fasting for Healing,\n- *Zhijiao* Fasting for Healing,\n- *Lingbao* Five Refinements for Reviving the Corpse Fasting for Self-Salvation,\n- *Five Thousand Characters* Fasting,\n- *Taiping Dongyuan* Five Kings Fasting.\n\nA vegetable diet in Daoist practice leads to attainment—this is the foremost discipline. Next in rank are fasts of a thousand days, a hundred days, monthly or daily abstentions, coarse or medicinal diets, qi consumption, drug ingestion, or embryonic nourishment, each taken as one’s capacity allows—this is what was previously called self-cultivation.\n\nFor inner and outer assemblies addressing great calamities, disasters, or karmic roots, a single high virtue is chosen as the Dharma Master, with five as attendant officials. A public altar is erected for grand atonement, where the penitent wears a hempen cord, scatters hair, and smears mud on the forehead, paying homage to the Thirty-Two Heavens. During the fast, petitions are offered at midnight and noon, and earnest prayers will surely be answered, following the instructed Mud and Charcoal method.\n\nFor the Five Kings Fasting, the officiant observes the numbers of the four seasons and months in spring, autumn, winter, and summer. The poor may gather twelve, while grand fasts require one hundred twenty, with worship conducted on a narrow outer altar. For regular fasts established by the wealthy or commoners, upright Daoists or mountain scholars may gather five, ten, twenty, fifty, or a hundred—though if many cannot be assembled, the number need not be fixed. Ritual garments are worn, and the Way is practiced for twenty-one days or a month.\n\nFor the impoverished, contributions are made according to ability, without requiring five participants. During the fast, a simple morning gruel is served, a midday vegetarian meal, and after noon, ginger-honey tea—nothing else passes the teeth. When breaking the fast, a feast is shared with ten, a hundred, or a thousand people, with more being better.\n\nIn prolonged fasting and precept observance, the Way is practiced at dawn, noon, and dusk—three times for ritual, three times for scripture recitation. For severe disasters, great calamities, or deliverance from karmic roots, the Way is practiced at six periods: dawn, noon, dusk, first watch, midnight, and cockcrow, with scriptures recited thrice daily.\n\n**Section on Recitation**\nAll Daoist practitioners must know that treasuring scriptures through mindful recitation makes them a compassionate mother. Whether Daoist or female adept, with courage and diligence—whether reciting from memory or reading aloud—each thought that generates understanding enters the gate of wisdom.\n\nDuring recitation, listen to one or two parts in eighty, while attending to external duties and rituals. Do not let this lead to distraction or deviation from the宗旨. Constantly reflect on the teaching mother as the root of our Dao, purifying the three karmas without harming reverence. Contemplate the subtle and wondrous, grasping its meaning and flavor, which yields four kinds of wisdom:\n1. Wisdom as my medicine, curing the madness of death,\n2. Wisdom as my lamp, dispelling the darkness of ignorance,\n3. Wisdom as my blade, severing the net of afflictions,\n4. Wisdom as my boat, ferrying across the sea of birth and death.\n\nThis is the true scriptural Dharma, capable of generating the Dharma-body, just as a worldly mother gives birth to her child. Thus, the most filial child constantly remembers the nurturing embrace of parental care—so too should we. Through this teaching mother, the untainted body is born, and we must always repay her kindness with offerings, enshrining her in a hall adorned with the seven treasures, with incense, flowers, lamps, candles, music, banners, and canopies, honoring her through recitation as one would a beloved parent.",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter on Seated Fasting and Disciplinary Penalties**\n\n**Section:** All Daoist practitioners must understand that proper decorum is essential when ascending the altar to perform rituals, maintaining reverence for the Most High as if present before their very eyes. Should Daoist priests or nuns be unfamiliar with the liturgical texts, their conduct may stray from the Way. When the Dharma-master ascends the high seat to elucidate matters in due order, guiding them toward awakening, those who err out of ignorance or confusion deserve compassion and pardon. They should be admonished and encouraged, neither resented nor ridiculed. To skillfully guide while remaining unoppressive, to govern without severity, and to refrain from disciplinary measures—this is the mark of a virtuous and noble demeanor.\n\nYet there are four kinds of those who, relying on worldly knowledge, persist in negligence and arrogance by defying the Dao:\n1. Those who disregard the scriptural Dharma,\n2. Those who disrespect the Dharma-master,\n3. Those who slight the assembled officials,\n4. Those who mock the outer assembly.\n\nFor violations of decorum, penalties shall be imposed according to the offense. If the transgression persists, the Three Treasures must be invoked, and the offender removed from the fasting rites. No leniency shall be granted, lest negligence spread unchecked. Those who supervise the fast and likewise show contempt shall also be penalized.\n\nShould the Dharma-master falter, they must acknowledge their error before the assembled officials, seek forgiveness through repentance, and renew their resolve. They must not persist in wrongdoing, defy the unseen decree, or compound their offense, for such actions endanger their own person. How could one not be vigilant?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Altar Rituals**\n\n**Section:** All Daoist practitioners must understand that when the assembled officials ascend the altar to receive the precepts, the inner and outer assemblies shall array themselves in the four directions, observing proper order in prostrations, kneeling, and supplications. When Daoist priests or nuns intone the invocations to the ten directions, the liturgy is divided into five phrases. At the beginning of each phrase, the voice rises, then descends in the subsequent phrase, modulating tone and breath to call forth the next line.\n\n*\"With utmost sincerity, we bow in reverence, tablets aligned before us, turning toward the honored direction. We submit our lives [to the boundless of] the [designated] direction—raising our voices to invoke the Upper Realm, lowering the tablets as the sound gently descends to the earth, then returning them to the heart, responding to the boundless call.\"*\n\nThereafter, the Most High descends the tablet, placing it before the knees, then to the ground. For the *Lingbao Heavenly Worthy*, the head is lowered to the earth. When the voice pauses, the hands and knees follow in measured delay. If the knees move before the voice concludes, or if voice and gesture fall out of sync, it is deemed negligent and incurs fault. One must click the teeth in mindfulness, ensuring the pace is unhurried. The sound of the teeth must not be audible. Conduct must align with the liturgical canons, the assembly solemn and reverent. Above, this humbles the divine spirits; below, it awakens faith. There is no excuse for negligence, for it violates the luminous precepts.\n\n**The Upper Scroll of the* Dongxuan Lingbao Daoist Liturgical Canons *concludes here.**\n**The Lower Scroll of the* Dongxuan Lingbao Daoist Liturgical Canons *begins.**",

      "translated_text": "**The Ranks of the Primordial Void Perfected One on Lamp-Lighting**\n\nThe liturgical canons state: All Daoist practitioners must know the methods of offering and worship, which are observed both at dawn and at night. The rites of lamp-lighting comprise both initial kindling and subsequent replenishment. When Daoists or female officers light lamps before darkness falls, it is called \"continuing the light.\" When lamps are lit after darkness has descended, it is called \"illuminating the light.\" There are two modes of lamp-lighting: the general and the specific.\n\nThe general mode proceeds thus: first, lamps are kindled before the visible sacred treasures—the Dao Treasure and the Scripture Treasure. Next, lamps are kindled before the chambers of the visible Perfected Masters. Additionally, in accordance with personal past affinities or revered moments in Daoist practice, lamps may be lit when entering or exiting a space to invoke two kinds of blessings: first, to aid the celestial radiance and pray for the purity of the physical eyes, dissolving obstructions and veils; second, to aid the celestial radiance and pray for clarity in all places one traverses, that one may always perceive with brightness.\n\nThe specific mode proceeds thus: for one’s own cultivation on the *benming* day, three lamps are lit to illuminate the Three Hun; for the *xingnian*, seven lamps are lit to illuminate the Seven Po; for the *taisui*, one lamp is lit to illuminate the entire body; for the *damu*, three lamps are lit; for the *xiaomu*, five lamps are lit; before the hall, seven lamps are lit to illuminate the Seven Ancestors; in the central courtyard, nine lamps are lit to illuminate the Nine Netherworlds; beside the gate, two lamps are lit to illuminate the palace and residence; at the earthly portal, twenty-four lamps are lit to illuminate the Twenty-Four Vital Breaths; toward the eight directions, eight lamps are lit to illuminate the Eight Trigrams; on the four sides and at the center, nine lamps are lit to illuminate the Nine Palaces; facing the ten directions, ten lamps are lit to illuminate the Ten Directions; twenty-eight lamps are lit to illuminate the Twenty-Eight Constellations; thirty-two lamps are lit to illuminate the Thirty-Two Heavens; and five lamps are distributed among the Five Directions to illuminate the Five Sacred Peaks. In total, one hundred and fifty-three lamps are lit.\n\nThe ritual decorum of lamp-lighting carries profound merit: above, it illuminates all heavens; below, it illuminates all earths. For eight directions and nine nights, its radiance is universally perceived. The officers attending the lamps must apply diligent care, ensuring the lamp flames burn brightly and clearly, never extinguishing midway or flickering dimly.\n\n**The Ranks on the Pre-Chanting of Water**\n\nThe liturgical canons state: All Daoist practitioners must know that after midday, one abstains from flavored drink and partakes only of pure water. Whether at any of the twelve hours when thirst arises and water is needed, or when invoking spells to repel malevolent forces, Daoists or female officers shall take a cup of water, exhale toward it three times, and strike the cup three times with an object. After chanting the spell and striking the cup three times, one exhales three times before drinking. If many are present, a larger vessel may be used. The incantation states:",

One must not purchase or use foods that are:\n- Cooked by fire but not solemnly prepared,\n- Impure,\n- Not offered with single-minded devotion,\n- Not for the relief of suffering.\n\nThose who violate this will not attract the descent of celestial deities.\n\nAdditionally, there are:\n5. **Five Peaks Offering**\n6. **Three Sovereigns Offering**\n7. **Three Ones Offering**\n8. **River Chart Offering**\n9. **Residential Offering**\n10. **Three-Five Offering**\n\nThese six offerings invoke earthly deities.

One must not purchase or use foods that are:\n- Cooked by fire but not solemnly prepared,\n- Impure,\n- Not offered with single-minded devotion,\n- Not for the relief of suffering.\n\nThose who violate this will not attract the descent of earthly deities.\n\nFor all offerings to celestial and earthly deities, the officiants and masters must first purify themselves through fasting, bathing, and abstinence before proceeding with the ritual.\n\nAfter the Winter Solstice and Summer Solstice, the first *jia-zi* day is to be used for the **Upper Prime Jia-Zi Offering**.\n\n---\n\n**Prohibitions**\n\nThe regulations state: All Daoist scholars should know that cultivating the body to seek transcendence ultimately aims for the true Dao. Entering the gate of sequential practice requires first prohibiting and distinguishing desires.\n\nIf Daoists or female officials have left behind worldly attachments and entered the gate of the Dao, they must be especially mindful of the taboos within the gate of the Dao. They should vow to observe all prohibitions and proceed directly to the Daoist sanctuary.\n\nWhat are these distinguished desires? Briefly enumerated, there are eighteen kinds, not caused by others but self-inflicted defeats:\n1. Defeat by deviant lust,\n2. Defeat by secret malice,\n3. Defeat by drinking alcohol,\n4. Defeat by laziness and negligence,\n5. Defeat by disobeying parents,\n6. Defeat by disobeying masters and superiors,\n7. Defeat by harming sentient beings,\n8. Defeat by killing sentient beings,\n9. Defeat by using the flesh of sentient beings,\n10. Defeat by eating the flesh of sentient beings,\n11. Defeat by planting the Five Pungent Plants,\n12. Defeat by using the Five Pungent Plants,\n13. Defeat by eating the Five Pungent Plants,\n14. Defeat by defecating or urinating while facing north,\n15. Defeat by removing one’s headwear or crown in the presence of the Two Assemblies,\n16. Defeat by disrespecting the Three Luminaries,\n17. Defeat by imposing punishments on the Eight Festival Days,\n18. Defeat by displaying anger or scolding on the first day of the lunar month.\n\nAll these defeats are great prohibitions of heaven and humanity. The Three Officials will record and investigate them, constituting grave sins:\n1. **Defeating the body** results in present-life evil retribution;\n2. **Defeating the mind** results in future-life evil destinies, causing the Three Hun to become afflicted, the Seven Po to flow competitively, and the Womb Spirit to detest one. When the Three Officials receive the record of evil, nightmares will torment the cinnabar heart, demons will seize the vermilion gates, essence and fluids will scatter, and the Perfected Spirits will become disoriented. If one can renounce desires, one becomes a candidate for immortality. One should maintain true fasting and precepts, avoid all defeats, and in walking, standing, sitting, and rising, not damage one’s dignity. Above, one repents for the three karmic offenses of the seven generations of ancestors and parents; below, one repents for the boundless sins of one’s own body. May one’s sins be extinguished, and may one be exempted from the fifteen kinds of contempt from others based on the three karmas:\n\n1. Exemption from contempt by external noble persons,\n2. Exemption from contempt by external wealthy persons,\n3. Exemption from contempt by external middle-class persons,\n4. Exemption from contempt by external sick persons,\n5. Exemption from contempt by external lowly persons,\n6. Exemption from contempt by internal masters and superiors,\n7. Exemption from contempt by internal persons superior to oneself,\n8. Exemption from contempt by internal persons inferior to oneself,\n9. Exemption from contempt by internal senior persons,\n10. Exemption from contempt by internal junior persons,\n11. Exemption from contempt by internal persons of the same rank,\n12. Exemption from contempt by internal upper-seat persons,\n13. Exemption from contempt by internal middle-seat persons,\n14. Exemption from contempt by internal lower-seat persons,\n15. Exemption from contempt by internal sick persons.\n\nAll these forms of contempt, when contemplated in conduct, lead to being treated with contempt.",

Though the pillow is clothed in a cloth pouch, it should be further wrapped in a reed cover. Remove this outer layer only when lying down to use the pillow.\n\n**Essential Methods of the Bright Mirror**\nThe teachings state: All Daoist practitioners must know how to observe the mirror. To perceive one’s form, one should slightly open a door, sit in darkness facing the light, briefly close the eyes, and visualize the face. Initially, all appears dim and indistinct, but after a night’s practice, vision gradually extends, and one’s face and eyes become clearly visible, bright and luminous. The best times are dawn and before sunset. At midday, when the sun is fiercest, slightly close the door and peer into the mirror in the dazzling light—nothing will be seen. Never observe the mirror by firelight; keep the fire at a distance, avoiding its direct glow.\n\nIf one wishes to open the eyes and observe the body in the mirror, do so in bright light without discomfort. To close the eyes and visualize the face, sit in darkness facing the light, then perceive the form. The key to mirror-gazing is to lie down calmly, focus the mind, and concentrate sincerely. In the moments before sleep, the body remains relaxed. Soon, a red or yellow light will emerge from the forehead, illuminating the entire room. In this hazy, dreamlike state, one sees their face within the light. After a brief mutual gaze, the vision fades. Upon waking, gaze into the mirror again. Before sleep, repeat the visualization as before, and nightly visions will appear. Sometimes upon waking, two faces appear opposite each other, or one’s own form is seen alongside another. In moments of sitting or lying in reverie, one may see divine youths or jade maidens, fifteen or sixteen years old, beautifully attired, their foreheads clearly visible—bow to them at once. One may hear voices beside them, foretelling all matters of fortune and misfortune under heaven. One may see through walls, or in dreams at dusk, gaze into the mirror. The light may return, allowing inner vision of the five viscera.\n\nFor mirror-gazing, follow the method of establishing the compass on the first *jia* day: use a nine-inch mirror, ensuring its surface is flawless and perfectly clear. Place it at eye level, fifteen inches to either side, with well-water drawn at dawn beneath it. At night, use a lamp fueled by hemp oil. Upon seeing one’s form, descend to the ground, bow deeply, and kneel, saying: *\"I share the same body with you; now our forms are divided. I beg for ten thousand years of sustenance, to always accompany you, that my body and form may never decline, and we may remain together for ten thousand years.\"*\n\nWithin the bright mirror, first observe the form, then perceive all things and hear human voices. Cultivate the bright mirror, and three youths and nine maidens will attend you: the youths standing six feet tall, the maidens five feet tall. The Bright Mirror Lord, with an official retinue of one hundred twenty attendants, governs the Palace of Guanyin. The pupils of his eyes emit radiant light, perceiving all fortune and misfortune. Long ago, a Daoist mirror-polisher earned his living grinding mirrors for common folk, charging only six or seven coins. He had no other method but to apply a medicinal paste, making the mirrors so luminous they could divide forms and induce transformations. This practice also sharpens the mind, enabling foresight of all things for ten thousand years.",

      "translated_text": "It also enables one to meet with the gods of the various heavens. By practicing the Dao and attaining the method, all divine immortals will come, and the Daoist will achieve the Dao.\n\nWhen a Daoist resides in a stone chamber, they should always hang a nine-inch bright mirror behind their back to ward off all evil. Moreover, though the hundred ghosts and ancient beings may transform their shapes, they cannot alter their reflections in the mirror. Upon seeing their forms in the mirror, they will immediately dissipate, causing no harm.\n\n**Nine-Noded Staff**\n\nThe Regulations state: All Daoist practitioners must know the nine-noded staff, which assists the elderly and rescues those in peril, each node bearing a name that must not be unknown.\n- The first node is called the Star of the Grand Sovereign,\n- The second node the Star of Mars,\n- The third node the Horn Star,\n- The fourth node the Star of the Balance,\n- The fifth node the Spread Star,\n- The sixth node the Encampment Star,\n- The seventh node the Star of Saturn,\n- The eighth node the Eastern Well Star,\n- The ninth node the Restraining Star.\n\nEach node is carved with the name of its corresponding star. Masters under forty who have not received the scriptural methods are deemed \"without rank\" and may not carry the staff. If afflicted by illness, they may use the staff to aid their recovery, but only when in the presence of their master; otherwise, they may not carry it.\n\n**Method of Forging the Divine Sword**\n\nThe Regulations state: All Daoist practitioners must know the method of forging the great sword. After one hundred days of purification, a smith is to use iron on the *gengshen* day of the seventh month or the *xinyou* day of the eighth month. If fine steel is employed, a sharp and refined sword is made: the ring two inches and six *fen* in diameter, the hilt one foot one inch and seven *fen* long, and the blade two feet four inches and seven *fen* long, totaling three feet nine inches in length. The ringed hook is three feet nine inches long, one inch and four *fen* wide, and three and a half *fen* thick, with a nine-inch tip forming the double-edged portion. The ring is mounted at the head, and both sides are carved with nine-blade characters. On the back of the ring, nine *ji* characters are inscribed, all aligned with the blade’s edge and carved deeply along the ring.\n\nThe characters are inlaid with gold or silver to enhance clarity. At the center of the ring, a raised half-ring projection is made, with the interior of the ring carved from wood: the left side bears the character for \"sun,\" and the right side the character for \"moon,\" its light encircled by an outer rim. To distinguish the sword’s left and right, inner and outer sides, on the second day of the second month, face south with the sword’s spine upward and its edge downward. Thus, east is left, west is right; the east side is outer, the west side inner.\n\nAt the nine-inch tip where the double edges begin, vertical carvings are made. Between the two edges, on the upper inner and outer surfaces, three *ding* characters are inscribed on each side, starting from the blade’s tip and spaced three inches apart, all facing the tip. The characters are carved in the style of the left-side script, beginning one and a half inches below the hilt. Such a sword, kept constantly between the bedding and comb of one’s sleeping place, never leaves the body, ensuring personal protection. It not only dispels evil spirits and myriad demons but also illuminates the five forms, enabling one to ascend as a flying immortal, the sword serving as one’s form.\n\nSome call it the \"Shadow-Dividing Sword,\" others the \"Divine Brandishing Blade.\" Its name is *Liang Fei*, its style *Zi Gan*. When sleeping, one should always invoke the sword’s name, saying: *\"Liang Fei, Zi Gan. Divine golden radiance, spirit of command, dispatch the hundred spirits, grant me long life, that no evil may harm me, and heaven and earth incline toward me.\"*\n\nThe characters carved on the back of the ring should descend toward the tip, carefully aligned to meet the edges on both sides. On the left side of the sword, the *ji* characters of the Dipper are carved, leaving the edge clear and following the hilt downward to meet the edges. On the right side, the same is done, with the *ji* characters of the Dipper aligned toward the spine and descending along the hilt to meet the edges. The star characters must be distinct and evenly distributed across the sword’s body, avoiding the blade’s edge. The star symbols should be round, carved like small rings, without piercing the solid iron at the ring’s center.\n\nExternally, the sword is wrapped in a blue-green silk cover. The stars are carved to resemble a screen ring, with the outer appearance of a ring but the interior solid. The raised half-ring at the center of the ring may be decorated according to personal taste. The blade is two feet four inches and seven *fen* long, the hilt two inches and seven *fen* long, and the tip nine inches, forming the double edges. The spine is three *fen* thick, and the blade one inch and four *fen* wide.\n\n**Proper Conduct When Relieving Oneself**\n\nThe Regulations state: All Daoist practitioners must know how to cultivate the body and respect their vestments. Before overcoming bodily impurities, one must observe proper conduct in all places. Daoist masters and female officials should first prepare a secluded area, its walls sealed with mud, inside and out kept immaculate, to avoid reproach or partiality from the two assemblies.\n\nWhen entering the privy, first remove the upper garment outside, then approach the door and recite the incantation:\n*\"Left Virtue Spirit, Right Virtue Spirit, Earth Controller of Life, Green Lady, remove my name from the register of death and let me enter the gate of life.\"*\nUpon completion, enter the privy. This serves three purposes: to honor the spirits of the vestments, to cultivate one’s own conduct, and to avoid offense to the two assemblies. A separate vessel of clean water and a clean towel should be placed beside the door. After cleansing, one may then don the garments.\n\nIf in the wilderness, recite:\n*\"Lady of the Wilds, Lady of the Wilds, remove my name from the register of death and let me enter the gate of life.\"*\n\nWhen urinating, recite:\n*\"Long Beard, Long Beard, let me enter the golden hall and jade chamber, grant me long life and old age, a hundred years, a thousand years, ever in your company.\"*\n\n**Dispelling Nightmares**\n\nThe Regulations state: All Daoist practitioners must know that the perfected ones of antiquity slept without dreaming and awoke without care. When the refinement of the mind is not yet pure, the six senses engage with the external world, the mind contends daily, and evil dreams are summoned.",

      "translated_text": "When Daoist priests, female officials, or lay followers—men and women alike—encounter nightmares, they should kneel facing north and invoke the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, recounting the dream’s details and beseeching the transformation of misfortune into fortune, calamity into blessing. Silently recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Perfected Jade Maidens, attend the true and guard the soul.\nThree Palaces’ Golden Lads, come and guard the Gate of Life.\nTransform evil into good, inscribe it above the Three Luminaries.\nGrant me long life, to ride the radiance and mount the clouds.\"*\n\nAfter reciting, swallow saliva seven times, click the teeth seven times, turn the pillow and lie down again. Thus, malevolent influences dissolve, and calamity is turned to blessing.\n\nIf the dream’s omen is extraordinary, take care not to speak of it to others. Silence brings fortune; discussion invites misfortune. Neither speaking nor discussing ensures ten thousand generations free from harm.\n\n**On Parents**\n\nThe Regulations state: All Daoist practitioners must understand that the Two Modes bestow life, and parents bequeath existence. Within the Dao of birth, one must know reverence and love.\n\nFor those who have left the household—Daoist priests and female officials—their bodies and minds adhere to the Dao, wholly severed from worldly customs. Yet in matters of nurture, they differ from ordinary laypeople.\n\nIf parents reside afar, visit them according to the four seasons; if nearby, pay respects at each month’s new moon. Whether in cold or heat, cool or warmth, observe the rites of inquiry.\n\nWhen seeing one’s household brothers in straitened circumstances, morning and night, with no means of support—if there are no brothers to provide—those who have left the household must discern their needs. They should reduce their own delicate provisions to supply them, ensuring no improper use outside the Dao.\n\nHousehold brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, and maternal kin are not subject to this rule. If one extends compassion beyond the Daoist precepts, and permission is granted, still, such provisions must not be used for non-Daoist purposes. One must not, on this account, share bed or seat, or eat from the same dish with parents, brothers, sisters, or close kin—whether inner or outer family.\n\nWhen removing the ritual robe, do not remain in the same place as the laity.\n\nIf parents fall ill, the heart of filial piety and fraternal love demands enduring hardship. One must diligently provide medicine and care, tending to them morning and night, sparing no effort for the parents who gave life.\n\nPresent parents are but temporary karmic connections; thus, we repay them with propriety, calling them \"parents.\" Never forget the debt of their nurture and upbringing.\n\n**On Old Age and Illness**\n\nThe Regulations state: All Daoist practitioners must understand that earthly existence arises from mixed karmic causes, yielding mixed karmic fruits. Across beginning, middle, and end, fortune and misfortune are not fixed.\n\nWhen Daoist priests or female officials contract illness—whether internal or external, mild or severe—unable to cultivate wisdom for self-benefit or wander to teach for others’ sake, they rely on twice-daily meals and four-seasonal clothing. With each thought, suffering clings; without support, the mind clings to form. There are two kinds of reliance:\n\n1. Reliance on six types of lay followers.\n2. Reliance on six types of Daoist companions.\n\nThe six types of lay followers are:\n1. Local venerable and virtuous persons.\n2. Local wealthy and noble persons.\n3. Local devout and faithful persons.\n4. One’s own parents.\n5. One’s own brothers.\n6. One’s own sisters.\n\nThe six types of Daoist companions are:\n1. One’s ordination master.\n2. One’s disciples.\n3. Fellow practitioners of the same teachings.\n4. Fellow practitioners of the same conduct.\n5. Those who share the same abode, whether senior or junior.\n6. Fellow practitioners of the same mind.\n\nThese twelve types of inner and outer companions, when faced with old age or illness, should generate five aspirations:\n1. May the two assemblies of the Dao be free from orphaned suffering.\n2. May the two assemblies of the Dao be free from fearful suffering.\n3. May the two assemblies of the Dao be free from hunger and cold.\n4. May the two assemblies of the Dao be free from longing and envy.\n5. May the two assemblies of the Dao be free from downfall and ruin.\n\nOnce these five aspirations are fulfilled, one should provide six kinds of support:\n1. Shelter according to means.\n2. Bedding according to means.\n3. Clothing and food according to means.\n4. Incense and lamps according to means.\n5. Water vessels and basins according to means.\n6. Attendants according to means.\n\nKnow that such a person, before attaining the Dao, through the three phases of existence—discarding and assuming bodies—will receive five exemptions from karmic retribution:\n1. Exemption from orphaned suffering.\n2. Exemption from fearful suffering.\n3. Exemption from hunger and cold.\n4. Exemption from longing and envy.\n5. Exemption from downfall and ruin.\n\nWhen the ill receive such support, according to their strength—whether walking, standing, sitting, or rising—they should cultivate twelve kinds of shame and reverence:\n1. Shame before the Celestial Worthy.\n2. Shame before the Perfected.\n3. Shame before the Immortals.\n4. Shame before the Lofty Heavens.\n5. Shame before the Vast Earth.\n6. Shame before the Sun and Moon.\n7. Shame before the venerable and virtuous.\n8. Shame before the wealthy and noble.\n9. Shame before the devout and faithful.\n10. Shame before parents.\n11. Shame before brothers.\n12. Shame before sisters.\n\nAspire that the shelter and provisions received may, while still in this body, dissolve suffering. May one attain the power of mental, physical, and verbal karma, and day and night, contemplate, praise, and bow in reverence. May the merit thus generated repay the kindness of those who came before, widely benefiting all karmic connections. May all be freed from illness and suffering, and the Dao’s gate be perfected.\n\nInner and outer practitioners, without lack or change, whether one, two, or countless in number, should compassionately ensure all receive and practice these teachings.\n\nIf, while practicing in a community, one is constrained by old age or illness and unable to personally receive offerings or [share with] companions, the six types of inner companions should, according to their means, receive them on their behalf.\n\n**On Transcendence**\n\nThe Regulations state: All Daoist practitioners must understand that in cultivating and establishing the gate of practice, there are distant and near paths. The distant path transcends the Three Realms; the near path attains long life and enduring vision.",

When the refinement of the mind is not yet pure, the six senses engage with the external world, the mind contends daily, and evil dreams are summoned.",

      "translated_text": "If Daoist priests or nuns, without exception, are summoned by accumulated blessings, reverently bearing the Three Caverns’ scriptures, their rank equaling the Five Peaks, their caps and robes—whether of silk or coarse cloth—fashioned in the pattern of the Two Modes, they cultivate the enterprise of long life and study the Dao of true perfection. Some shed their forms in secret transformation; others, their lives ended, become ghostly officials. Thus, the Yellow Emperor ascended in transcendence, and the sword and crow remained; on Gaoqiu, the coffin was split open, and the body soared into the heavens. Therefore, the weight of the Dharma-body is such that neither death nor life can abandon it.\n\nWhen the ranks of immortality are not yet fulfilled and the time of passing arrives, at the hour of departure, they should bathe, comb their hair, don their caps and robes, and face the path of ascending to heaven, without calling back the hun-soul. Place them separately in a clean bamboo mat, spread with a pure mat, move them therein, and cover them with a light quilt. A staff is set to the left, a divine sword to the right; along the sides of the bier, pure grass is spread. Two kinds of disciples—inner and outer—stand to the left, while secular kin, men and women, stand to the right (if a nun, they are separated by a curtain). After the initial expression of grief, weeping follows at the proper times. At the head of the coffin, a case is placed to hold the external registers of the Dao.\n\nOne regulation states: The three registers are sealed and sent into a deep stone chamber, along with the requisite provisions—incense, medicines, clothing, brushes, inkstones, towels, and basins—along with all ritual implements, ensuring nothing is lacking. Gold, silver, and silk fabrics must not be used in excess. There are two kinds of burial chambers: one in the mountains and forests, the other in a high, secluded place.\n\n**On the Ritual Attire of Master and Disciple**\n\nThe Regulations state: All who study the Dao must understand that within our gate of practice, the bond between master and disciple is most weighty. Though the ultimate aim is to transcend death, in principle there should be no mourning rites. Yet, as the body is relinquished and received anew, there is the suffering of birth and decay.\n\nIf Daoist priests or nuns, or their inner disciples, change their attire to white caps and robes, weeping at the proper times, they should abstain from salt and sour foods for forty-nine days. After bathing, they resume their headscarves on the hundredth day, wearing pale yellow garments in a three-year period of heart-mourning. Outer disciples—those who have not resided with the master—change their attire to white caps and robes, weeping at the proper times, abstaining from salt and sour foods for twenty-one days. After bathing, they resume their headscarves, observing heart-mourning for three years.\n\nFor senior outer disciples, the rites follow those of outer disciples; for junior ones, they abstain from salt and sour foods for three days, for the master’s rank is not to be treated lightly. If the master has no secular heirs, only the disciples shall undertake the rites, leading one another in filial piety. With banners, flowers, towels, basins, incense, and ritual implements, they arrange the master’s repose. At the place of the funeral bier, a hundred-day fast is held before the rites conclude.\n\nIf the time is distant, and the master enters the stone chamber after the forty-nine days, another seven days of bathing and resuming headscarves follow. If the master weeps for a disciple, they abstain from salt and sour foods for seven days. After entering the chamber, they observe heart-mourning but do not change attire, for disciples vary in number, and individual rites cannot be prescribed for each. If fellow practitioners of the same aspiration and Dao send off a friend, they make slight changes to their caps and robes. After the usual entry into the chamber, a single day of mourning is observed.\n\nIf the deceased was of the same abbey, the community ceases musical offerings and conducts a hundred-day period of reverence.\n\n**On the Ritual Attire for Parents**\n\nThe Regulations state: All who study the Dao must understand that leaving the household and departing from the secular world is made possible by one’s parents, whose grace in giving life and nurturing is profound. Mourning cannot be absent, nor can grief be unexpressed; the rites must be observed in proper order.\n\nIf Daoist priests or nuns encounter the passing of grandparents, they observe a year-long mourning but must not approach the body in a separate room. They express grief through weeping for five days and do not receive condolences. For uncles and brothers, the rites are the same as for grandparents. If the burial has not yet occurred, they remain in mourning. For daughters-in-law and those of lower status, weeping in grief is not permitted. After the rites conclude, they bathe and resume their usual attire but must not adopt secular mourning garments. Those who violate this lose the Dao, incurring a penalty greater than the highest regulation.\n\nFor one’s own parents, weeping and expressing grief are permitted. After a hundred days of mourning, they resume their headscarves, change their garments to pale yellow, and observe heart-mourning for three years, without further weeping. If the time is distant, the rites follow those for a master, with a funeral bier set up. For distant relatives, small-funeral rites last five months, and fine-mourning rites last three months. For fellow travelers and companions met in journeying across the four seas, upon their death, participation in the burial is permitted. After the encoffining, one may visit to inquire, expressing sorrow and distress, but weeping is not allowed. Daoist law does not permit condolence visits, yet once one has entered the gate, it is unreasonable to abruptly refuse. These are the worldly regulations of the *Lingbao* scriptures.\n\n**On Merit for the Deceased**\n\nThe Regulations state: All who study the Dao must understand that when a master or ancestor passes, both inner and outer disciples, in performing merit for the deceased, follow the same rites, though their financial means may differ. From the day of receiving the teachings, one serves five or six masters. If the officiant’s resources are exhausted, three merit-retreat fasts are held.\n\nAfter a hundred days, a fivefold *Lian Shengshi* fast is established, lasting three days and nights, conducted beside the chamber of repose. If the chamber is nearby, it may also be held within the abbey. On the anniversary of the passing, a *Huanglu* fast is held; if impoverished, a *Lingbin* fast suffices. On the monthly anniversary, a fast is conducted according to one’s means.\n\nThe first is to repay the master-ancestor’s wisdom; the second, to repay the master’s provision of clothing and food; the third, to repay the master-ancestor’s protection; the fourth, to repay the master’s grace in leaving the secular world. If a disciple, upon the master-ancestor’s passing, does not grieve deeply or perform merit to pursue blessings, they commit the sin of unfiliality and incur four kinds of evil retribution: first, present disciples will abandon them; second, past disciples will turn their backs on them; third, future disciples will forsake them. Each should apply their heart, ensuring three generations of remembrance, mutually guiding and delivering one another. Be warned and be cautious.\n\n**On the Property of the Deceased**\n\nThe Regulations state: All who study the Dao must understand that cultivating the body and delivering the mind, maintaining an empty hall and a pure chamber, is the way of the immortals’ household.\n\nIf Daoist priests or nuns, whether for the needs of merit or for sustenance, whether obtained through practicing the Dao and kept in their rooms or stored elsewhere, pass away before using them, their scriptures, abbey treasures, memorial texts, and miscellaneous writings are to be distributed among their inner disciples. Their mounts, attendants, and any possessions, even a single item, are likewise to be allocated.",
