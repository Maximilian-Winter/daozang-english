  "full_translation": "**The Return to True Nature Collection**\n\n**Title:** *The Return to True Nature Collection* (*Huanzhen Ji*). Compiled by Wang Jie (courtesy name Daoyuan) of the Yuan dynasty. Three scrolls. Based on the edition from the *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity*, Supreme Mystery Section.\n\n**Preface to *The Return to True Nature Collection***\n\nThe Dao of immortality has been esteemed since antiquity. When the Yellow Emperor sought the Way from Guangchengzi, the world came to revere the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, for Guangchengzi was none other than Laozi himself. The discourse on immortality began thus, with figures such as Jian Keng of the Tang, Xiaofu of the Xia, Wanqiu of the Shang, and Wang Qiao of the Zhou—immortals who were already present in the Three Dynasties. Yet it was during the reign of King Mu of Zhou, who built a thatched pavilion to receive scholars, that such teachings first became prominent.\n\nBy the time of the First Emperor of Qin and Emperor Wu of Han, rulers were deluded by the arts of alchemists and physicians. Though men like Wang Cijiong and Dongfang Shuo did not follow true masters, their heterodox doctrines spread and became entangled, ultimately leading to their own downfall. Thus, the great scholars and eminent minds of the age arose to censure them, and rightly so.\n\nThen came Wei Boyang of the Han, who modeled his *Triple Concordance* (*Cantong Qi*) after the *Book of Changes*, expanding upon the *Ancient Text of the Dragon and Tiger Classic* to elucidate the path of elixir refinement. He steered clear of the misguided practices of ingesting minerals, herbs, clouds, or mists, or relying on breathwork and physical regimens. Instead, he illuminated the natural principles of body, mind, spirit, and *qi*, employing the trigrams, hexagrams, and celestial markers as his measures. All aligned perfectly with the marvelous interplay of odd and even, images and numbers.\n\nLater, Zhongli Quan transmitted these teachings to Lü Yan of the Tang, who upheld and expounded upon them. Through his songs, discourses, and debates, he largely restored the true intent of the tradition, and worthy successors have not been lacking in subsequent ages. In the Song dynasty, figures such as Zhang Ziyang, Shi Yaolin, Chen Niuwan, Bai Ziqing, Li Yuxi, and Li Qing’an all stood as paragons of their time. Their writings and doctrines were no less profound than those of Boyang, and in some cases, they achieved even deeper, wordless understanding.\n\nThough separated by a thousand years, how is it that their words align as if tallying tokens? It is not by coincidence but by necessity. The principle remains the same across a thousand generations, as does the heart-mind. What diverges and causes confusion must be the false and deceptive doctrines—those that seek to impress the present or mislead future generations. How could they ever accord with the natural Way of body, mind, spirit, and *qi*?\n\nThus, the ancients insisted on transmitting the Dao only to the worthy, for the Way does not propagate in vain. Moreover, masters do not recklessly reveal their profound and hidden mysteries. As for students, if they lack the substance of accumulated merit and cultivated conduct, merely adorning themselves with empty formalities and false reputations, chasing fame and acclaim, how can they be spoken of in the same breath as the Dao? How could they ever give voice to its truths?\n\nThe Master of Chaotic Oneness of Xiujiang in Nanchang, having abandoned his former surname, was a man of vast learning. He once encountered an extraordinary person from whom he received secret transmissions, and he diligently set forth his discourses. I have long studied his words, and though we met briefly in a guest lodge, haste prevented me from fully exploring their depths. This spring, my disciple Yuan Wenyi returned from Wu, bringing with him the *Return to True Nature Collection* compiled by the master, and asked me to compose a preface.\n\nAfter savoring its contents repeatedly, I find it truly conveys the essence of the golden elixir and the returning cinnabar. Its exposition of the subtle and the manifest, the fundamental and the functional, is such that one may grasp both principle and application. If one cultivates accordingly, even those who come after may rival Ziyang or Qing’an—who can say who will surpass whom?\n\nMoreover, I have long lamented the superficial, reckless, and perverse habits of the age, which have spread and festered without end. Yet I rejoice that these words are sufficient to revitalize the decadence of our era. If steadfast scholars and upright individuals can discern the difference between jade and mere stone, then roaming the primordial radiance of the spirit’s inception or refining *qi* beyond the chaotic vastness of the primordial void will not be difficult. This is how one fully returns to the origin and comprehends the end, exhausting the divine and knowing transformation.\n\nPerhaps one day, I may summon the yellow crane to descend from the empty skies, and together we shall discourse amidst the isles and peaks of the Xiang and Yue rivers—it is not too late. This book is presented here at the outset in anticipation of that day.\n\nWritten in the fifth month of summer, the *ren-shen* year of the Hongwu reign.\nPreface by Zhang Yuchu, the Celestial Master.\n\n**The Return to True Nature Collection, Scroll One**\nCompiled by the Master of Chaotic Oneness.\n\n**The Marvelous Principles of the Golden Elixir**\n\nThree points like stars—its principle runs deep,\nA hook suspends the moon’s arc, fixing rise and fall.\nShould one awaken to this mystery within the mystery,\nThe mountains and rivers of the earth all turn to gold.\n\nThe Dao’s wonder within the mystery knows no bounds,\nThe three teachings transmit but a single mystery.\nGrasp the true workings hidden within,\nAs crow flies and hare runs, never leaving the heavens.\n\nThe Mysterious Pass—a single aperture at the center,\nNeither before nor behind, alone suspended in emptiness.\nSilently turn the light inward to dwell here,\nNaturally spirit and *qi* merge with the mystery as one.\n\nTwo jade rings linked in a pair,\n*Qian* revolves and *Kun* turns, sharing a single origin.\nWithin lies a single true message—\nWithout a master’s transmission, speak not idly of it.\n\nOne aperture enfolds the workings of creation,\nThree great medicines fuse within.\nThe *Xun* wind stirs the furnace’s fire,\nRefining the divine elixir till the crucible glows red.\n\nNurtured like an infant in the ten-month womb,\nThe work reaches this point, shedding worldly dust.\nSpiritual transformations manifest in all directions,\nA single orb of radiance pierces through the crown.\n\nBirthless and deathless, one attains the Golden Immortal,\nA single point of light illumines the great thousand worlds.\nShattering empty space, the whole body is revealed,\nReturning to the state before father and mother were born.\n\n**Oral Instructions**\nIn the study of the Dao, first one must clearly discern the true crucible and furnace within the body. Next, one must recognize the completeness of the medicinal substances. Third, one must understand the methods of advancing and retreating the firing times. Only when these are all distinctly clarified may one begin the practice of refinement.\n\nThe Patriarch said: \"Once you know where to begin, proceed from that very point.\" Some ask: \"What does it mean to proceed?\" Ah—this is the work itself. The principle of the work lies in unbroken practice through the twelve double-hours of the day and night. When the heart is empty and desireless, inwardly observe to cultivate one’s nature. When the winter solstice arrives and *gui* is born, then close the gates to restore one’s life. Internally, revolve the Celestial Stem without movement; externally, turn the Dipper’s handle to propel change. A single *qi* circulates throughout; the Three Primes return to the body. The true fire forges and refines, coalescing the golden embryo of empty *qi*—this is called the talismanic fire returning the elixir. With prolonged practice, it gradually congeals and solidifies, uniting with the great void and merging with the true Dao.\n\n**Direct Pointers to the Golden Elixir**\nThe Mysterious Pass—a single aperture within the human body,\nAbove the kidneys, below the heart, west of the liver, east of the lungs.\nNeither biased nor leaning, standing alone in emptiness,\nNeither inside nor outside, the origin of the primordial beginning.\nWithout desire, cultivate nature; with desire, apply effort.\nFan open the furnace bellows, stir the *Xun* wind.\nThunder roars at the sea’s bottom, startling the harbor dragon.\nFire flames in the *Kan* position, ascending to the *Li* palace.\nThe Yellow Dame leads the bride, marrying her to the Metal Lord.\nThe three families meet, their affections harmonious.\nThe elixir congeals through nine revolutions, the crucible filled with rosy radiance.\nDiligently gather, diligently refine, gradually congealing and enriching.\nUnceasingly guard with steadfastness, warding off danger in the wild battle.\nThe spiritual embryo nurtured, pure yang *qi* surges.\nEstablish merit and conduct, your name reaching the upper heavens.\nShedding the embryo, spirit transforms—endless are the Dao’s wonders.\n\n**The Three Treasures of the Human Body**\nThe Three Treasures of the Precelestial are the Three Substances—\nThe Dao of spontaneity:\nOriginal essence, original *qi*, original spirit.\n\nThe Three Treasures of the Postcelestial are the Three Functions—\nThe Dao of effort:\nCoital essence, breath *qi*, deliberative spirit.\n\nThe three treasures of the human body all arise from heaven and earth, residing in the precelestial to be born, their wondrous substance perfectly formed. In the postcelestial, they transform through the union of form and response. Without the precelestial, the postcelestial cannot be born; without the postcelestial, the precelestial cannot be completed. The principle of these two is one body differentiated—one must not lose the latter nor harm the former.\n\nThus, refine coital essence with original essence, refine breath *qi* with original *qi*, refine deliberative spirit with original spirit. When the three substances are perfectly fused, one merges with the true Dao. Naturally, original essence is firm and coital essence does not leak; original *qi* abides and breath *qi* does not escape; original spirit is whole and deliberative spirit does not arise.\n\nThe method of immortal cultivation has no other secret—it is simply to preserve these three. As the Patriarch said: \"When essence is whole, desire is not thought of; when *qi* is whole, food is not thought of; when spirit is whole, sleep is not thought of.\" It is also said: \"When the three are true and whole, one will surely ascend as an immortal; when the three are whole and true, one will surely ascend in flight.\" These words exhaust the matter—let the scholar savor them.\n\n**The Three Passes of the Human Body**\nSeize the *Kan* position to solidify the heart’s center...\n\nRefining the *Li* palace within the abdomen’s yin,\nThe three passes of the human body are none other than essence, *qi*, and spirit.\nEssence resides in *Kan*; *qi* resides in *Li*; spirit resides in the heart.\nThe initial pass refines essence into *qi*, drawing forth the yang within *Kan*.\nThe middle pass refines *qi* into spirit, replenishing the yin within *Li* to form *Qian*.\nThe upper pass refines spirit to return to emptiness, where the primordial *Qian* transforms and reverts to the *Kun* position, thereby congealing the elixir.\nOnce the elixir is congealed, spirit and *qi* become radiant and clear, merging with the Great Void as one body. Within and without, purity prevails, and one naturally unites with the true Dao.\nThus, in stillness, one nurtures inherent nature; in motion, one restores the mandate of life. Cultivating both nature and life, form and spirit attain wondrous perfection. This is the sublime secret of the cyclical firing process for returning the elixir.\n\nHence, a verse is composed to attest to this:\nWhen the hour of *gui* arises within the body,\nDraw the yang from *Kan* to replenish *Li*.\nNorth Dipper and South Star invert their positions—\nIn a single moment, the foundation of the elixir is laid.\n\nThe half-*sheng* crucible,\nUpholding heaven and propping up earth, is the half-*sheng* crucible.\nDragon and tiger seized, simmered together in one vessel.\nTen rounds of martial firing, refined with civil fire—\nAfter nine revolutions, the elixir is complete, and one strides toward Penglai.\n\nThe half-*sheng* crucible is another name for the earthen cauldron.\nWithin the human body, it lies at the very center of heaven and earth, in the palace of *wu* and *ji*, the cavity of spirit and *qi*. With this, yin and yang may unite, and nature and life may be quickened.\nAs the Patriarch Lü Chunyang said:\n*A single grain conceals the world; within the half-sheng crucible, mountains and rivers are stewed.*\nSo it is.\nThe scholar must not strain to conjecture but should receive transmission directly from an enlightened master before true understanding may dawn.\n\nAs the ancients said:\n*\"One may wear through iron shoes in fruitless search,\nYet find it effortlessly when the time is ripe.\"*\n\n**Diagram of the Five Phases’ Transformations**\nThe Five Phases are the five numinous essences of the Three Powers. Though their forms in the Five Phases’ transformations are not uniform, their Dao is one. Thus, in heaven they become the five stars and the five emperors; on earth, the five sacred peaks and the five spirits; in the human, the five viscera and the five constants. Gathered into a single body, the Five Phases are therein as one. Scattered into the myriad forms, the Five Phases are also therein as one. Therefore, the essential practice of cultivating the Real consists solely in circulating these five qi. If one can preserve these five qi without dissipation, blending them into the Great Void, they coalesce into the golden embryo of empty qi—this is called the numinous elixir. But those who dull their spirit and chase after things are instead harmed by the Five Thieves.\n\nSome may ask: What are the Five Thieves?\nThe Five Thieves are the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and intent. Unless one is a person of the greatest spiritual capacity, one is seldom not deluded by these five and thus loses one’s nature. As the *Yinfu Jing* says: *\"Heaven has five thieves; those who perceive them prosper.\"* The Buddha also taught: *\"Without eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, or intent; without form, sound, scent, taste, touch, or dharma.\"* Such is the case.\n\nThe work of attaining the Dao employs the three flowers gathering at the crown and the five qi returning to the origin—then transformations naturally emerge from the Five Phases.\n\n**Diagram of the Heart’s Ease in the Great Dao**\nHeaven’s creative transformations divide from the One Center.\n\nMan weaves his great designs from the heart—\nFor the *Heart’s Ease* is the source of the Great Dao.\n\nThe Great Dao’s generation and transformation arise from nothing beyond the fifty-five numbers of the *River Chart*, which the sages took as their model. As Laozi said: *\"The nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth; the named is the mother of the myriad things.\"* The nameless beginning is the union of the Three and Five as one reality; the named mother is the division of the Three and Five into separate realities. Thus, that which is above form is called Heaven; that which is below form is called Earth; and that which arises between the two forms is called Man. Man, paired with Heaven and Earth, is called the Three Powers. When the Three Powers unite with the Dao, the myriad things are born of a single qi. Only Man receives the full essence of Heaven and Earth at birth: Heaven bestows spirit, Earth bestows essence, and the harmonious center bestows qi. These three are complete within the body, which is the undifferentiated Great Ultimate. As Master Zhou said: *\"From Non-Ultimate comes the Great Ultimate; the Great Ultimate moves and generates yang, rests and generates yin.\"* When yang’s movement reaches its extreme, it returns to stillness—yin embraces the bowels. When yin’s stillness reaches its extreme, it returns to movement—yang gathers yin. Yin and yang seek each other and generate the five qi; the five qi divide and transform to produce the eight trigrams; the eight trigrams cycle to form the four seasons; the four seasons revolve without cease to generate the myriad things. The myriad things flourish, each returning to its root. Such is the constant ease of the Great Dao.\n\nIn the language of the elixir path, this is nothing more than circulating the *Heart’s Ease*, inverting yin and yang, and reverting spirit and qi. Thus, Qian and Kun serve as the gates of the *Ease*; Kan and Li are the mechanism of the sun and moon’s coming and going; Zhen and Dui mark the spring and autumn equinoxes at Mao and You. When refining the elixir, internally one contains the Three and Five, firmly sealed and unmoving; externally, the Wood of the eastern Three engenders the Fire of the southern Two, and the Metal of the western Four engenders the Water of the northern One. The four images each return to their Five, then the central emptiness of the true Earth of Wu and Ji divides and transforms, drawing the raised Earth of Wu back to the Kan position. Wood is compelled to generate Fire, steaming and fuming; Metal is pressed to generate Water, seething and boiling. At this moment, one stirs the pivot at the crown, slowly drawing out the yang within Kan to replenish the yin of Li, forming the body of Qian. Using the Earth of Ji, one retreats the tally from the Li position, gathering the five qi to circulate the thirty numbers of the celestial cycle, halting only at the Kun palace. There the Reverted Elixir coalesces, Wu and Ji return to their places, and one drinks deeply of the knife and spoon. The singular nature becomes profoundly serene, the four qi grow limpid and bright, and the Five and Ten are once more emptied.\n\nThe *Diagram of the Great Ultimate* states: *\"The true of the Non-Ultimate, the essence of the Two and Five, wondrously unite and congeal.\"* This is the principle. Zhang Ziyang’s *Awakening to Reality* says:\n*\"Three, Five, and One—just these three words,\nRarely understood in ancient or modern times.\nThe eastern Three and southern Two together make Five;\nThe northern One and western Four share the same.*\n*Wu and Ji return to the generative Five;\nThe Three Families meet to form the Infant.\nThe Infant is the One containing true qi;\nAfter ten months, the embryo is complete, and one enters the foundation of the sage.\"*\nThese words exhaust the matter; let the student savor them.\n\n**Diagrams of Tun and Meng**\nThe two trigrams Tun and Meng are metaphors employed by the sages to illustrate the advance of fire and retreat of the tally. Yang ascends from below—this is Tun; yin retreats from above—this is Meng. Tun has Zhen below and Kan above: Zhen’s initial nine uses the Gengzi line, Kan’s six four uses the Wushen line. Meng has Kan below and Gen above: Kan’s initial six uses the Wuyin line, Gen’s six four uses the Bingxu line. The lines Zi, Shen, Yin, and Xu correspond to *yuan, heng, li,* and *zhen*. One trigram inverted becomes two trigrams, their bodies and functions interpenetrating, movement and stillness mutually dependent. Among the sixty-four hexagrams, each follows the same pattern. One hexagram has six lines; two hexagrams total twelve lines. In terms of a year, this corresponds to twelve months; in terms of a day, to twelve hours. Yang advances for six, yin retreats for six. The alchemical saying of \"morning Tun and evening Meng\" is merely a figurative way of discussing the clarity of fire times within the body, the subtleties of opening and closing, exhalation and inhalation.\n\nWei Boyang’s *Triplex Unity* states: *\"Tun uses Zi and Shen; Meng uses Yin and Xu. Each of the sixty hexagrams has its own day; I briefly present the two images, though I cannot exhaust them.\"* *Awakening to Reality* also says: *\"The Southern and Northern Schools reverse the hexagram images; morning and evening fire times align with the celestial pivot.\"* These words are clear. Yet students must not take mere words on paper as full understanding; they must seek a enlightened teacher’s guidance to recognize the hexagrams within their own bodies. The discourse on hexagrams is also a metaphor—it is only because the sages had no choice that they borrowed images to guide later students. Once the decisive word breaks through, the Dao of Heaven and Earth and the self will be in perfect resonance.\n\n**Diagram of the Celestial Cycle Fire Times**\nEleven\nThirty Spokes\n\nA single hub unites them all.\n\nThe Celestial Cycle Fire Times embody the mechanism of Qian and Kun’s opening and closing, the transformation of Yin and Yang. In the vastness of Heaven and Earth, in the smallness of the human body, all possess the numerical patterns of generative fire times. The *Book of Changes* states: *\"One opening, one closing is called change; ceaseless coming and going is called penetration.\"* Thus, in the human body, exhalation connects to the root of Heaven, inhalation to the root of Earth. Each exhalation and inhalation naturally harmonizes with the creative workings of Heaven and Earth. Yet this breath is not the breath of mouth and nose—it is the inner movement of a single vital breath. For this reason, the ancestral masters established words and images to guide those who would come after. Texts such as the *Scripture of Dragon and Tiger*, the *Triplex Unity*, and the *Six Hundred Fire Records* all elucidate the fire times, truly desiring that people practice this Dao.\n\nThus, a year is condensed into a month, a month into a day, a day into an hour, an hour into a single breath. Within the work of a single breath, one advances the Yang fire and retreats the Yin tally, seizing the three thousand six hundred breaths of primordial qi, reversing the seventy-two seasonal nodes at their crucial passes. A grain of millet-like pearl is produced, descending into the Yellow Court, where emptiness and fullness merge, the sacred qi congeals into truth, and the sacred embryo is formed—this is called the tally-fire returned elixir.\n\nZhang Ziyang said: *\"Without marking time to divide Zi and Wu, within the hexagrams and lines, Qian and Kun are determined.\"* Liao Zhenzi said: *\"The great medicine consists of three: essence, qi, and spirit; naturally, mother and child embrace one another. Returning wind and merging into the true body, the forging work renews day by day.\"* Master Shao also said: *\"When Qian meets Xun, observe the Moon’s Grotto; when Earth meets Thunder, tread the Heavenly Root. Freely coming and going between Heavenly Root and Moon’s Grotto, the thirty-six palaces are all spring.\"* These all elucidate the principles of fire times.\n\nPractitioners of the true, even if they possess the three impermeabilities yet do not practice the work of fire times, remain within Yin and will ultimately only produce a Yin spirit, unable to manifest a Yang spirit. Lü Chunyang thus spoke of the *\"clay in the kiln.\"* Yet clay in the kiln, unrefined by fire, remains mere earth—how can it become firm? The human body is likewise like clay in the kiln. Without practicing the work of fire times and refining the medicine, one will never achieve the wondrous union of form and spirit, merging with the Dao in truth.\n\nThus, the sages transmitted the medicine but not the fire—since ancient times, few have known the fire times. This is the ancestral masters’ untransmitted secret, not that it was not transmitted, but that it is only passed to those worthy of receiving it. How could it be spoken of lightly?\n\n**The Three Essentials of Internal Alchemy**\n1. The Crucible\n2. The Medicine\n3. The Fire Times\n\n**Alternative Names for the Crucible:**\nHeavenly Heart, Mysterious Pass, Earthen Cauldron, Yellow Court, Yellow Chamber, Central Palace, Spirit Terrace, Penglai Gourd, Yin-Yang Boundary, Lead Furnace, Mercury Kiln, Spirit Chamber, Medicine Chamber, Empty Valley, Mysterious Valley, Heavenly Valley, Golden Valley, Compass Center, Life Stem, Gourd Heaven, Void Hall, Primordial Palace, Mysterious Female, Jade Terrace, Purple Palace, Reclining Moon Furnace, Half-Sheng Cauldron, Wu-Ji Gate, Return-to-Life Pass, Geng-Xin Chamber, Jia-Yi Door, Southwest Quarter, Spirit-Qi Cavern, Cinnabar Crucible, Guarding Unity Altar, Dragon-Tiger Cavern, Yellow Dame’s Abode, Vajra Circle, Chestnut Thorn Enclosure.\n\n**Alternative Names for the Medicine:**\nGolden Essence, Wood Sap, Red Lead, Black Mercury, Cinnabar, Quicksilver, White Gold, Black Tin, Kan Male, Li Female, Azure Tortoise, Scarlet Serpent, Golden Duke, Yellow Dame, Infant, Enchanting Maiden, Fire Dragon, Water Tiger, Wood Lad, Stone Maiden, White Snow, Yellow Sprout, Intertwined Pears, Fire Dates, Raven Liver, Hare Marrow, Qian Horse, Kun Ox, Sun Essence, Moon Radiance, Heavenly Soul, Earthly Soul, Golden Flower, Purple Ganoderma, Golden Fat, Jade Fluid, Jade Blossom, Jade Pistil, Gold in Water, Wood in Fire, Yang within Yin, Yin within Yang, White within Black, Male within Female, Azure Dragon Fat, White Tiger Marrow.\n\n**Alternative Names for the Fire Times:**\nSpirit within Qi, Yang within Yin, Twenty-Four Qi, Seventy-Two Seasonal Nodes, Twenty-Eight Constellations, Sixty-Four Hexagrams, Twelve Fields, Sun and Moon in Conjunction, Tides Rising and Falling, Thirty-Two Heavens, Thirty Civil Lines, Seventy Military Refinements.\n\nThese three essentials are the secret keys to cultivating the true. The essentials of cultivation are three: first, know the crucible; second, know the medicine; third, know the fire times. Only when these three are clearly understood may one begin the practice. Though their names vary endlessly, they are but different terms to dispel the learner’s confusion.\n\nThe crucible is the Heavenly Heart. The medicine is essence and qi. The fire times are spirit and qi. Within the twelve double-hours, turn the light inward, reflect, and maintain continuity as if barely present—like a hen brooding her eggs, like a dragon nurturing its pearl. Naturally, spirit governs qi, and qi nourishes spirit, merging within the heart to become one with the Great Void.\n\nAt such a time, there is no medicine, no fire times—one spirit is all spirits, one qi is all qi. Yet even so, the field of the heart and the sea of nature cannot remain eternally still. Stillness reaches its extreme and must move, giving rise to Yang. Yang is the winter solstice, the time when Gui is born within the human body. At this moment, one must close the gates and practice the fire times: stir the Xun wind, fan the furnace bellows, order the five qi, harmonize the hundred spirits, raise the Wu earth, seal Gen and Dui, draw forth the Yang within Kan to replenish the Yin within Li. Before the intent ceases, Wu gathers the medicine with Ji earth and returns it together, sending it into the crucible. The Xun gate opens on both sides, true fire refines it, and the golden elixir is formed, imperishable for ten thousand kalpas.\n\nThus, the more the elixir is refined, the firmer it becomes; the more the practice is accumulated, the deeper it grows. Diligently cultivating this, one may indeed hope for the Dao of immortality—how could this be empty words?\n\n*The Upper Scroll of the Return to the True concludes. The Middle Scroll of the Return to the True begins.*\n\n**On the Secret Essentials of the Returned Elixir**\nThe Returned Elixir is the Dao of returning to the root and restoring the origin. At birth, humans receive the father’s essence and mother’s blood, and in early infancy, the original essence, original qi, and original spirit are all perfectly whole. As one gradually matures, the four gates—eyes, ears, nose, and tongue—become enticed, and the single numinous true nature is touched by form, sound, fragrance, and taste, growing ever more deeply habituated. Day after day, year after year, the original essence transforms into generative essence, the original qi into breathing qi, and the original spirit into the spirit of thought and worry. These Three Origins dissipate, making it difficult to recover one’s celestial authenticity. Thus, the ancestral masters transmitted their teachings, recording them in the elixir classics to show people the methods of cultivation and restoration. If essence is depleted, replenish it with essence; if qi is depleted, replenish it with qi; if spirit is depleted, replenish it with spirit—this is the Dao of returning to the root and restoring the origin.\n\nWhat does \"restoration\" entail? It means taking the preservation of essence as the deep root, the preservation of qi as the firm stem, and the preservation of spirit as the wondrous union. If one can preserve these Three, they truly become the genuine medicinal substances within the body. Yet even so, without knowing the methods of applying the firing times and refining with fire, one remains bound to Yin and will never attain the Dao of perfecting both form and spirit.\n\nWho would have known that the human Dao aligns with Heaven and Earth? A single breath of effort seizes a year’s transformation from Heaven and Earth. Qian and Kun serve as the crucible and vessel; the sun and moon as water and fire; the crow and hare as the medicinal substances; Yin and Yang as the mechanism of transformation; the dragon and tiger as the wondrous function; Zi and Wu as the winter and summer solstices; Mao and You as the spring and autumn equinoxes. These are all metaphorical allusions—yet in truth, they do not extend beyond the three words: body, heart, and intent. The body is tied to essence, the heart to qi, and the intent to spirit.\n\n\"Return\" means reversing the course of these Three; \"restore\" means restoring these Three to their true state. When the Three are whole and united with the true, this is called the Returned Elixir. Fearing that learners might cling to one-sided views and fail to grasp this principle, I dare not fear heavenly retribution and must reveal this celestial mechanism.\n\nWhenever entering the chamber to refine the elixir, one must empty the heart and still the nature, merging spirit and qi within the Central Field. When the first Yang stirs—this is the winter solstice within the body. At this moment, one must close the gates, raise Wu earth to seal the depths of the sea abyss, and not rashly employ the hidden dragon. Only when the dragon appears in the field should one turn the pivot at the crown gate, slowly lifting it from the Great Mystery Palace. With one ascent, three hours pass, and the flying dragon penetrates the Three Passes; with another ascent, three more hours pass, and it ascends to the Southern Palace for union. This is drawing the Yang from Kan to replenish the Yin within Li. From Zi to Si, the six Yangs gather in Qian. Beyond this, Yang has no end in principle, yet a single Yin arises beneath the five Yangs, and Kun Yin takes charge. With Ji earth, one retreats the Yin tally from Li, descending the Magpie Bridge at the Golden Gate, entering the Crimson Palace through the Towering Chambers, and returning it to the earthen crucible. From Wu to Hai, the six Yin tallies complete. Yang reclaims Kun’s position, the Xun gate opens on both sides, and true fire refines it, forming the golden embryo of empty qi—this is called the Returned Elixir.\n\nRefining the medicine in accordance with the times, applying the tallies in harmony with the cycles, diligently tempering and refining, transforming the insubstantial into substance—after ten months of work, the embryo is perfected, the crucible is changed, and the spirit is moved to dwell in the Mud Pill Palace. The Heavenly Gate bursts open, and one carefully nurtures the emerging spirit. At this time, one must stand firmly on solid ground, not erring by even a hair’s breadth. Only when spiritual powers are fully rounded and transformations are free will one penetrate stone and pass through metal, respond to circumstances as they arise, roam the clouds at ease, and enjoy boundless joy—attaining the status of a true immortal who transcends the kalpas, all through resolute cultivation.\n\nThe wondrous function of elixir refinement begins with effort and ends in effortlessness. Nature is established upon life, and life is cultivated through nature. When nature and life merge, they become one with the Great Void—what bondage of life and death could remain? This is the unchanging great method transmitted by the sages. To seek other wonders beyond this is to stray into heterodox paths.\n\nSome may cut off thoughts to guard emptiness, or abstain from grain to starve the body; some may fix their minds in silent audience, or swallow mist and inhale qi; some may practice massage and guiding exercises, or imagine fire burning the navel; some may choose beautiful women as crucibles and vessels, prizing unyielding virility as victory in battle; some may take female essence as the elixir’s head, using the union of yin and yang as their wondrous function; some may enter the chamber at Zi and Wu hours to sit in meditation, or refrain from firing times during Mao and You months—such minor paths number in the thousands. These are all side doors and narrow trails; how could they be worthy of discussion as the Dao?\n\nThe ancestral masters said: \"The Dao has three thousand six hundred gates, and each person clings to one as their root. Yet within these, the subtle and mysterious essence lies beyond the three thousand six hundred gates.\" These words say it all. Learners must be careful not to cling and thus delude themselves. Have you not heard the ancients say: \"If one does not meet a true master at the outset, one will grow old and become a mere antique\"?\n\nThe essentials of cultivating the true lie in exhaustively investigating principle and fully realizing nature, investigating things to extend knowledge, and only then returning to the root and restoring life—only thus can one verify the great Dao. Without seeking a true teacher’s guidance, even with the talents of Yan or Min, one will not succeed. Let the learner ponder this.\n\n**On the Fusion of Nature and Life**\nNature is the single numinous spirit within the human body. Life is the single original Yang true qi within the human body. Life does not arise without nature, and nature does not stand without life. Before the parents’ birth, the spirit was contained within the empty qi alone—luminous and clear, lacking nothing, with nothing in excess.\n\nAfter the parents’ birth, the single original true qi resides between the two kidneys, within the empty and mysterious aperture—here life is established, and here too nature lodges in the body. Establishing nature and establishing life, this is called the \"Heavenly Heart,\" also known as \"Heaven’s mandate as nature.\" Nature is the master of the entire human body; life is its root. In daily activity, responding to the myriad affairs depends on nature, while accomplishing the hundred tasks belongs to the body. Nature enables the activation of subtle transformations; life enables the transmutation of yin and yang. When nature responds to things, life serves as its substance and nature as its function; when life operates and transforms, nature serves as its substance and life as its function. Substance and function share a single source, manifest and subtle without separation—only then can it be called the Dao. Neither can be lacking.\n\nThe Dao of refining the returning elixir is nothing more than the fusion of spirit and qi, restoring the original wholeness of nature and life. The substance of nature is Qian; the substance of life is Kun. The primordial Qian belongs to metal; the primordial Kun belongs to earth. Qian metal resides within Kun earth and is concealed—mother and child guard one another, with nature as the child and life as the mother. As the alchemical classics say, \"Let it be the host and I the guest,\" thus borrowing the body as the host’s function.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"Great indeed is the primordial Qian, from which all things receive their beginning\"—this is nature. \"Profound indeed is the primordial Kun, from which all things receive their birth\"—this is life. The *Dao De Jing* says: \"Always be desireless to observe its mystery\"—this is the substance of nature in Qian. \"Always have desire to observe its manifestations\"—this is the function of life in Kun. Qian and Kun are the gateways of the *Changes*, and truly the root and origin of the substance and function of nature and life.\n\nNature and life are spirit and qi; spirit and qi are lead and mercury; lead and mercury are Kan and Li; Kan and Li are the sun and moon; the sun and moon are water and fire. When water and fire achieve balance, wondrously uniting and congealing, this is the Dao of the fusion of nature and life.\n\nAt the moment of their fusion, the heart is empty and luminously clear, without form or name, without substance or function. When nature and life emanate and ascend, yang moves and yin separates—there is form and name, substance and function. At this point, practicing the *Scripture of the Numinous Treasure for Salvation*, substance and function then divide into inner and outer. Internally, nature resides in the Central Palace and governs movement—this is substance. Externally, the emotions circulate with the Dipper’s handle in cyclic return—this is function. Preserve it with sincerity, employ it with truth, and naturally the elixir will form in the crucible, nurturing the sacred embryo. Like an infant in the womb, after ten months the qi is complete, the embryo sheds its form through spiritual transformation, a body exists beyond the body, and the perfected one appears—thus the great task of dual cultivation of nature and life is accomplished.\n\nAll those who study the Dao and attain the Way, along with eminent Chan practitioners, must not cling rigidly; only through the dual cultivation of nature and life can the great task be achieved. Master Lü said: \"Cultivating only the golden elixir without cultivating nature is the foremost illness in practice. Only understanding true nature without refining the elixir—even after ten thousand kalpas, the radiant spirit will hardly enter sagehood.\" These words say it all.\n\nIf one cultivates only nature without life, after the body’s death, nature becomes a yin spirit and cannot manifest spiritual powers. If one cultivates only life without nature, though the body may achieve longevity, it remains bound to form and cannot transcend the kalpas. Both are cases of solitary yin or solitary yang, falling into the study of lopsided desiccation.\n\nWhat then is the dual cultivation of nature and life? Have you not heard: \"Comprehending nature leads to sagehood—this heart connects with all hearts, wisdom is vast, and nothing that comes is unknown.\" \"Comprehending life leads to longevity—this body endures through kalpas unharmed, able to transform all forms, and nowhere it goes is it not transformed.\" Only when nature and life are both complete is the Dao attained; only when form and spirit are both wondrous is the golden immortal realized. What doubt can there be? What doubt can there be?\n\n**On Curbing Anger and Restraining Desire**\nCurbing anger and restraining desire are the essentials of the sage’s self-cultivation and careful conduct. Curbing anger is to discipline the heart; restraining desire is to halt thoughts. Disciplining the heart prevents anger from arising; halting thoughts prevents desire from emerging. When anger does not arise, the heart is naturally clear; when desire does not emerge, the emotions are naturally still. With a clear heart and still nature, the Dao naturally congeals.\n\nThus, the noble one who cultivates this prospers; the petty person who violates it meets misfortune. How can one not know: if anger is not curbed, the heart’s fire flames upward, and the celestial nature is obscured by clouds. If desire is not restrained, the yang essence rushes downward, and the bitter sea’s waves surge. Thus, one drifts in the realm of life and death, sinking into the depths of love and desire—then the true unified qi originally bestowed by Heaven and Earth stealthily flees and lodges in Kun.\n\nProceeding thus, Kun rides Qian’s solitary yang to become Kan, while Qian, broken by Kun, loses its solitary yang to become Li. Li accumulates yin and generates anger; Kan accumulates yang and generates desire. Examine this: anger arises from qi, desire from essence. When qi stirs, anger gives rise to greed and hatred; when essence stirs, desire clings to delusion and attachment. Externally, one clashes and grinds against things; internally, one’s own spirit and essence dissipate, falling into the dark paths and forever losing the true Dao—how lamentable!\n\nThus, I record the words of the ancient sages as a mirror for later learners. The Most High said: \"Attain utmost emptiness, maintain profound stillness, and while the myriad things arise together, I observe their return.\" The *Book of Changes* states: \"Return—is this not the manifestation of Heaven and Earth’s heart?\" Gautama said: \"Do not give rise to the mind in response to form, sound, fragrance, taste, touch, or dharma; give rise to the mind without abiding anywhere.\" He also said: \"All that has form is illusory; if one sees that all forms are not form, one sees the Tathāgata.\" Confucius said: \"The Dao is that from which one cannot depart even for a moment; what can be departed from is not the Dao.\" He also said: \"Rectify the heart, sincerely cultivate the will, and do not, even for the time of a meal, depart from benevolence.\"\n\nYanzi neither displaced his anger nor repeated his errors, mastering himself to return to ritual propriety, and for three months did not depart from benevolence. Master Zeng said: \"The eyes of ten men gaze upon him, the fingers of ten men point at him—how solemn this is! Thus the noble person must be vigilant in his solitude.\" Zisi said: \"If utmost virtue and the supreme Dao do not congeal within, [all effort is in vain].\" Mencius therefore declared: \"I am skilled in nourishing my vast and overflowing qi, which fills the space between Heaven and Earth, utmost in magnitude and firmness. It is nurtured with uprightness and suffers no harm.\"\n\nAll these exemplify the Dao of curbing wrath and restraining desire to preserve the Great Harmony. In the alchemical tradition, this is the principle of \"drawing from Kan to fill Li,\" the regulation of Water and Fire in perfect balance; in the Chan tradition, it is the principle of \"turning the light inward to reflect,\" transforming the passions of the material world into emptiness; in the Confucian tradition, it is the principle of \"mastering oneself to return to ritual propriety,\" rectifying the heart and sincerely cultivating the will.\n\nThus considered, the Three Teachings share the same Dao though their names differ; in truth, they do not depart from the wondrous workings of the single heart. Therefore, Heaven and Earth possess no second Dao, and the sages harbor no dual hearts. Let learners not regard the four characters \"curbing wrath and restraining desire\" as easily dismissed—this is the pivotal mechanism of cultivating the true. Its essential nature lies in reduction: diminishing the external to augment the internal. When the internal is settled, qi harmonizes; when qi harmonizes, spirit harmonizes; when spirit harmonizes, the Dao becomes serene.\n\nAt this stage, one transcends yin and yang, emerges from life and death, and moves freely without entanglement, ascending Peng Isle, roaming the Grotto-Heavens, transforming at will—how profoundly mysterious! Such talk—is it not like speaking of dreams?\n\nDreams, in their essence, arise from the transformations of qi. When yang governs yin, the hun spirit restrains the po soul, and if the spirit dreams, it is luminous and clearly perceived. When yin governs yang, the po soul restrains the hun spirit, and the spirit becomes obscured by worldly desires—thus dreams wander in confusion, dim and indistinct.\n\nOf old, the Divine Farmer, grieving over the people’s suffering, dreamed of ascending to the celestial court, where the Heavenly Sovereign bestowed upon him the book of herbal testing. The Yellow Emperor, yearning for the Dao, dreamed of wandering the land of Huaxu’s grand palace. Zhuang Zhou discoursed on the Dao and thus dreamed of transforming into a butterfly. Confucius praised the *Zhouyi* and thus dreamed of meeting the Duke of Zhou. In these sages, the heart and the Dao were profoundly united; their dreams arose from resonance, their yang spirit blazing through the host of yin. Bright and radiant, though dreams, they were not mere dreams—such is the wondrous work of the spirit emergent. Thus, the dreams of ordinary people are worlds apart.\n\nThe hearts of ordinary people cling to their affairs, drifting upon the sea of desire, sinking into the river of attachment. How could they know that the single spark of original spirit, by day, dwells in the head? The eyes covet forms, and the spirit is stained by them—this is the dream within the eyes. The ears covet sounds, and the spirit is stained by them—this is the dream within the ears. The nose covets fragrances, and the spirit clings to them—this is the dream within the nose. The mouth covets flavors, and the spirit is stained by them—this is the dream within the mouth. By night, the spirit returns to nest in the heart; as soon as sleep comes, the yin po envelops the hun, and dreams become turbid and chaotic, seeing all manner of things, upside-down and inverted, shifting with every thought. Thus, whether eyes are open or closed, dreams arise.\n\nThis is because the field of the heart is impure, and the spirit does not abide in its chamber. Day by day, month by month, the essence and spirit dissipate, and so one falls into the six destinies, entering the realm of dreams and illusions. As the ancients said, the root of life and death is but a single thought—creation itself is dreamlike, the very root of life and death.\n\nTherefore, the great cultivator has no dreams. By day, they are free and untrammeled; by night, they are likewise free and untrammeled. Spirit guards qi, and qi embraces spirit, merging into a single whole, transcending beyond yin and yang—what dreams could there be? If the learner of the Dao can recognize that dreams are but dreams and master them, they stand beyond life and death, unobscured by yin and yang. Let the learner ponder this.\n\n**On Nature**\nNature is the primordial, singular spark of utmost numinosity within the human body—this is the original spirit. This numinosity existed before parents gave birth, never increasing; it remains after birth, never diminishing. It is inherently complete, neither lacking nor in excess.\n\nThus, when a person is born, their nature is never not good, though their qi and material endowment differ, each receiving its own distinct allotment. Hence, there is the original nature and the nature of qi and material endowment. The original nature is awareness and movement; the nature of qi and material endowment is greed, wrath, delusion, and attachment.\n\nTherefore, those of superior wisdom awaken to their original nature, unentangled by even a thread, all dharmas luminously clear. Those of middling wisdom are half-enlightened, half-deluded: when they grasp it, it remains; when they let go, it vanishes. Those of lesser wisdom have no hold on their spirit, their thoughts giving rise to emotions, clinging to their affairs.\n\nObserving these three, we see that nature has gradations. Some may ask: The Buddha said that all sentient beings possess Buddha-nature—why then are human natures graded? Ah! Even the father and child of tigers and wolves, the ruler and subjects of bees and ants, are not without Buddha-nature—it is their forms that differ. The nature of humans and the myriad things is the same; the forms of humans and the myriad things differ.\n\nNature is like the moon in the sky; form is like water upon the earth. When the myriad waters are clear, the single moon shines universally; when the myriad waters are turbid, the single moon is universally dim. It is not that the moon is bright or dim—it is that the waters are clear or muddy. Those who become sages, wise ones, or worthies receive the clear qi; those who become fools, dullards, or evildoers receive the turbid qi. Thus, the Buddha said: *A thousand rivers hold a thousand moons; ten thousand miles without clouds, ten thousand miles of sky.* Such is the truth.\n\nThis single spark of luminous clarity is formless and without appearance, timeless and without age, piercing stone and penetrating metal—there is fundamentally nothing to be said of it. If one can penetrate and see through this point, unshaken by any realm, inwardly observing the heart in unbroken continuity, forging it into a single whole, standing alone in the void—then one naturally has the adamantine gate of protection, all demons disperse, and one may speak as an equal with the ancient Buddhas.\n\nIf the learner of the Dao does not understand the work of inwardly guarding stillness within the true nature, even if they can recite the entire canon, wielding eloquent speech, in the end they will only waste their essence and spirit, to no benefit. All conditioned dharmas, having attainment, also have failure—seeking the true by clinging to forms? All is delusion. If one merely practices the unconditioned dharma, eating when hungry, drinking when thirsty, one may yet fall into dead emptiness.\n\nThis single circle ○ rolls like a pearl upon a plate, perfectly round and following the earth, vibrantly alive—it is not being, nor is it non-being, nor is it attached to any single thing. How does the assembly comprehend this?\n\nAh! *After the rain, the river is empty, the mountain colors still; a single crow’s cry in the bright moonlight.*\n\n**Song**\nNine Songs of the Whirling Wind Mingled as One\n\n**First Song**\nThe Celestial Sovereign descends from the south to dwell in the Purple Palace,\nThe Three Passes sealed fast, summoning the Yellow Lad.\nFrom the east, a whip

feeling,\nHeaven and earth, sun and moon shine day and night.\nThe embryo congeals for ten months, the sacred form complete,\nThe Heavenly Gate splits with a thunderous crack.\nThe Perfected One appears—who dares contest?\nRiding clouds, straddling a crane, they ascend to Jade Capital.\n\n**Third Song**\nThe Crimson Child of the east is called Wood Lad,\nAt midnight, he cradles the sun from the sea’s depths.\nDragon soaring, chariot ascending Fusang,\nRed wheels rising straight to heaven’s center.\nLight illumines the cloud-brocade robes,\nTimely as the Petal Maidens return to the grotto chamber.\nTheir passions unite, spring’s heart fragrant,\nA single drop of true essence births the mysterious yellow.\nDwelling in chaos yet containing pure radiance,\nMouth full of rich fragrance, flowing jade nectar.\nDrink and feast—every limb at ease,\nReversing age, returning to youth, heaven and earth endure.\n\n**Fourth Song**\nHeaven’s metal, dark in hue; earth’s soil, hidden,\nThe Xun wind stirs, the furnace’s fire blazes bright.\n\n**Fifth Song**\nIn an instant, tempered into diamond-hard,\nForged as the wisdom-sword named Ganjiang.\nIts three-foot edge keen as autumn frost,\nGhost-spirits lose their courage, dragons and tigers submit.\nThe Seven Stars nightly radiate their light,\nWielded crosswise or inverted—its power boundless.\n\n**Sixth Song**\nThe golden womb, empty qi enfolding Qian’s origin,\nBehind the life-gate, before the secret portal.\nRising high within the circle, neither leaning nor slanting,\nPrecisely centered, two inches hold the mystery.\nThe Yang Lord grasps heaven and earth’s primacy,\nCirculating the four virtues in ceaseless revolution.\nFrom Kunlun, a single stream flows westward,\nPouring downward a thousand feet, the Silver River hangs suspended.\nDewdrops scatter into the Golden Valley Garden,\nWhere peach blossoms bloom for three thousand years.\nPluck and eat them to stabilize the cinnabar field,\nAnd become an ageless immortal among men.\nWhen the time comes, ascend straight to Nine Flowers’ peak,\nWhere white clouds and yellow cranes come fluttering.\n\n**Seventh Song**\nThe sun emerges from the vaulted sky, illuminating the eight wilds,\nAt Qujiang’s heights, the golden crow soars.\nThe Central August Elder sits in the Jade Hall,\nHolding a purple flute to play the *Dongzhang*.\nAt the first note, the sea waters surge,\nAt the second, the moonlight’s glow falls away.\nThe third note blends all into primordial chaos,\nAnd the music of the celestial court fills the heavens.\nAt this moment, drinking alone the *tihu* nectar,\nThe five viscera grow distinctly cool.\nLimbs as if drunk, form and substance forgotten,\nUnknowing where this land of nowhere lies.\n\n**Eighth Song**\nAt Eastern Flower’s first dawn, the dawn light parts,\nThe Five Elders pay homage to the Purple Throne.\nHolding the Three Flowers, they offer them to the Emperor Lord,\nA single sphere of harmonious qi revives yang spring.\nAt heaven’s center, sun and moon shine with renewed brilliance,\nFrom the four directions, all blessings gather as guests.\nThe nine movements of the flute tame phoenix and simurgh,\nEastern splendor reaches its zenith—customs grow pure.\nRivers and seas fall silent, mountains veil themselves in clouds,\nThe myriad people delight in their labors, heaven and earth grow clear.\n\n**Ninth Song**\nWhen the morning sun strikes the stone, purple clouds arise,\nDrifting with the wind toward Kunlun.\nFeathered canopies cast their shade in floating mists,\nFlowing essence and jade light gleam freshly white.\nDescending straight through the Wu-Ji Gate,\nSnowflakes swirl in the empty sky.\nSpirit sprouts flourish, jade flowers bloom in spring,\nDeep roots and firm stems ensure long life.\nForm and spirit both wondrous, the Dao unites with the real,\nFreely roaming forever as Penglai’s people.\n\n**Song of Cultivating the Real, Bestowed upon the Chaos-Dwelling Disciple**\nTo cultivate the real, first seek the true earth,\nEstablish the crucible in the southwest as the elixir mother.\nThe female gate and mysterious portal open left and right,\nRegulate the breath, unbroken, to return qi to the ancestor.\nThe spirit dwells in chaos, the empty mystery,\nNo south, no north, no west, no east.\nThe four images and five phases all converge,\nTurn the light inward to behold true emptiness.\nTrue emptiness, bright and clear, without the slightest veil,\nA single expanse of autumn sky, boundless.\nThe moon shines upon the Heavenly Altar, jade dew chills,\nWithin this realm, heaven and earth attain their true meaning.\nAt the first stirring of yang, heavenly water is born,\nThunder roars at noon, striking the third watch.\nRiding the tiger, seize the lead from the water palace,\nMounting the dragon, capture the mercury to return to Crimson Mound.\nLead and mercury refined in the furnace by true fire,\nTempered into diamond hardness like iron.\nA single grain of millet falls into the Yellow Court,\nThe Great One contains the real, the sacred embryo forms.\nSpring winds fill the earth, the yellow sprout deepens,\nAfter drinking the medicinal pellet, sing of jade simplicity.\nDrunk, play a tune on the no-holes flute,\nIts wondrous sound flies forth as the music of the celestial spheres.\nAt this moment, the joy of attainment is truly delightful,\nThis family’s tradition is most purely refined.\nThe blind see clearly, the deaf hear keenly,\nThe mute taste honey—yet to whom can they speak?\nWithout leaving the courtyard, know the ten thousand states,\nComing and going, roam boundlessly, the spirit knows no limits.\nThe great image, formless, hides in the indistinct,\nSun and moon shine day and night without cease.\nCarefree and content, delighting in long life,\nShatter the void, shed the mortal husk.\nPierce heaven and earth, transcend death and life,\nResplendent divine light illumines the vast expanse.\nThree thousand deeds complete, eight hundred merits fulfilled,\nUtter loyalty and perfect filial piety return the light to the wind.\nAbove, move the Heavenly Emperor to send down a cinnabar edict,\nRiding clouds in broad daylight, ascend to the celestial palace.\n\n**Hunran Song**\nThe Daoist of Hunran—none know his name,\nHidden in a three-household village, his traces concealed.\nNeither coming nor going, ever alone and abiding,\nFormless and nameless, yet utterly distinct.\nA single point of light is the Dao’s scripture,\nBright and mysterious, concealed in empty stillness.\nAt times, following transformation, he emerges,\nWhen chaos splits open, he dwells in the Great Rescue.\nMovement is ruled by yang, stillness by yin,\nHeaven and earth are born from a single breath.\nOne gives birth to two, two to three,\nThe ten thousand images, the forest of phenomena, open and close as one.\nQian revolves, Kun turns, the mechanism never ceases,\nSun and moon revolve, twin jades conjoin.\nWhat does the Daoist of Hunran do?\nEach day, he meets people to discourse on the *Zhouyi*.\nWithin the *Yi*, creation’s workings are not hard to know—\nIn broad daylight beneath the blue sky, thunder crashes.\nThe tiger roars on Eastern Mountain, ten thousand forests tremble,\nThe dragon coils in Western River, waves rise a thousand feet.\nIn an instant, dragon and tiger return together,\nThe eight poles are dustless, the sky’s hue azure.\nAt this moment, Hunran alone delights,\nWashing his feet in empty mystery, seated at the center.\nMoonlight cleanses my flesh and bones,\nFrom Nine Flowers Heaven, fragrant liquid flows.\nDrink and feast—life endures long,\nDrunk, play a tune on the no-holes flute.\nThe great sound fills the ten directions when released,\nThe subtle sound, when gathered, hides in secrecy.\nFirm roots and deep stems—Dao arises of itself,\nEmerging from death, transcending life, ever in unity.\nUnbroken and silent, never leaving the stream,\nFor ten months, nurture the embryo—guard it, do not lose it.\nWhen the time comes, shatter the upper barrier,\nMyriad rosy clouds illuminate Penglai’s blossoms.\nAbove, dwell in Mud Pill Palace to pay homage to the Sacred One,\nThe immortals of the Three Isles gather in the jade chamber.\nBeyond kalpas, carefree as a solitary wanderer,\nNo longer keeping days with the dusty world.\nIf people could understand the *Hunran Song*,\nOnly then would their cultivation and studies be complete.\n\n**Zhongyang Song**\nThe Master of the Bamboo Grove, refined and secluded in nature,\nBorn between earth below and heaven above.\n\nThe Primordial envelops the Great Ultimate, named the Central Yang,\nA single speck of radiance—priceless in the world.\nNeither behind nor ahead,\nVast as a millet grain, suspended in empty space.\nIt transforms and births the myriad heavens, forests of phenomena,\nThe Dipper’s pivot revolves ceaselessly through day and night.\nNeither below nor above,\nFive *zhang* from the earth, the golden crow takes flight.\nFrom its beak emerges a crimson wheel,\nIlluminating Samantabhadra astride the white elephant.\nThe Gate of Heaven closes, the Door of Earth opens,\nA single *qi* circulates—this is the subtle sign.\nDragons chant, clouds rise, ocean waves surge,\nTigers roar, winds stir, sunlight wanes into dusk.\nAt this moment, the two essences return as one,\nClouds disperse, winds cease, emptiness turns azure.\nThe Human Gate is sealed, the Ghost Portal blocked,\nA drop of golden essence is thus attained.\nIn the refining furnace, flames are stoked to forge a sword,\nIts edge sharp as ice, its brilliance dazzling.\nIn wild battles, it wards off peril and pacifies the land,\nSevering the Three Corpses and the Six Bandits.\nThe Three Corpses perish, the Six Bandits vanish,\nMerged into a single mass, becoming adamantine.\nTranscending the mortal to enter the sacred, emerging from the kalpa,\nNo longer dwelling in the underworld but ascending to heaven.\nAt this time, truly joyous,\nIn the scorching sixth month, white snow flies.\nSated with the finest ambrosia at the celestial feast,\nJade nectar flows ceaselessly from the mouth.\nBlood transmutes to white, bones to jade,\nThe whole body refined to the lightness of a feather.\nThe numinous embryo nurtured for ten full months,\nA breakthrough at the crown—radiance is born.\nNeither born nor dead,\nAcross kalpas to this day, nameless.\nOne spirit transforms into ten thousand spirits,\nYet it is none other than the Master of Central Yang.\n\n**Song of Realization**\nThe Master of Realization studied Zhuangzi and Laozi,\nSwiftly awakening to the true mechanism, turning back early.\nHaving received but half a phrase from the immortal teacher,\nIron walls and silver mountains were all toppled.\nThe ancestral nature, luminous and perfect, is the root,\nNeither form nor void.\nPiercing gold and stone, emerging from the kalpa,\nStill and unmoving, yet responsive when moved.\nThus, in refining the elixir, employ the Mysterious Female,\nTempering mercury and smelting lead to secure the furnace and cauldron.\nWithin the twelve double-hours, inwardly observe in stillness,\nEmbracing the myriad phenomena, dwelling in the immortal realm.\nWhen yang arises, swiftly gather it,\nRevolving the wind in fusion, wielding the numinous banner.\nThe Yellow Lad of the sea’s depths embraces the sun as it rises,\nThe Azure Dragon leaps backward to the Southern *Li*.\nThe White Tiger is led down from the Golden Gate,\nFeathered canopies and radiant essence flow unceasing.\nStraight through the Tower of Nine Stories to the Crimson Palace,\nA perfect pearl is born, like the bright moon.\nThe ten directions’ vast phenomena return to celestial might,\nFilling the cave and flooding the void with flying white snow.\nGhosts wail, spirits grieve, all traces vanish,\nHeaven and earth become a realm of glass.\nAt this moment, truly joyous,\nThis is the secret of the Returned Elixir.\nThe mute tasting honey knows it for himself,\nLucidly, neither birth nor extinction.\nThe infant nurtured for ten months,\nA breakthrough at the crown—heavenly immortals descend.\nThree thousand deeds perfected, eight hundred merits complete,\nRiding the phoenix, ascending in broad daylight to Penglai.\n\n**Song of the Returned Elixir**\nA stranger bestowed upon me the secret of the Returned Elixir,\nThe ninefold cyclical elixir holds profound meaning.\nThe Mysterious Pass—a single aperture, the root of heaven and earth,\nForcibly named the Elixir Furnace, called the Reclining Moon.\nNeither biased nor partial, precisely centered,\nThe Eight Trigrams and Five Phases encircle and array.\nThe immortals point to this as the foundation of the elixir,\nOnly requiring the primordial spirit to return to the *qi*-cavern.\nSpirit and *qi* merge, anchoring the elixir field,\nLuminous and void, illuminating the profound and clear.\nThe four great elements of the body belong to yin,\nYin’s turbidity seizes yang, and yang is not pure.\nDescending from root to branch, form is born,\nThus human life bears loss and deficiency.\nKnow this, cultivate, and attain longevity,\nNot knowing it, cultivation follows form to extinction.\nNow I teach you the *Song of the Returned Elixir*,\nWithin its verses, the celestial mechanism is fully revealed.\nThe opening and closing of heaven and earth is the gate of the *Yi*,\nThe sun and moon’s cyclic return—its mechanism never ceases.\nObserve the Way of Heaven, grasp the movement of Heaven,\nYou must recognize the winter solstice within the body.\nAt the winter solstice, yang arises—swiftly gather the lead,\nFirmly guard the Three Passes, be resolute and fierce.\nSummon the warhorses to return to the stable,\nLock the macaque in chains, allow no laxity.\nIn the *Li* Palace, the wind of the sacred flute stirs,\nBlowing down flames to scorch the sea with heat.\nIn an instant, the hidden dragon appears in the field,\nThunder crashes, the dragon soars, golden lightning flashes.\nThe Yellow River’s waves surge through the Gate of Heaven,\nTransforming into sweet rain to wash away demonic filth.\nThe Metal Lord rides the tiger down the western mountain,\nSeizing the dragon pearl, his heart alone rejoices.\nReturn it to the earthen crucible, seal it firmly,\nOne battle’s success—no need to cling to clumsiness.\nThe sky, free of floating haze, *qi* clear and bright,\nNaturally, the elixir congeals within the crucible.\nIn the cave, spring warms, the yellow sprout grows,\nOn the cliff, emptiness clears, white snow flies.\nThe sacred embryo nurtured for ten months,\nDivine water and the flower pool flow unceasing.\nWithin this subtle principle lies profound mystery,\nSoft as silk, hard as iron.\nMortal bones refined into cold jade,\nRed blood tempered into white.\nShedding the womb, changing the crucible, emerging from the yin tally,\nShattering the void, the scene of radiance transforms.\nThe yang spirit’s transformations—vast and luminous,\nAlone stepping upon rosy clouds to the Golden Gate.\n\n**Five Hymns of Pacing the Void**\n\n**I**\nThe One True Master of Dwelling in Mystery,\nDaily pays homage to Kunlun.\nCloud encampments chant jade melodies,\nThe Dragon Han soars with golden tribute.\nDharma rain sprinkles the

ascending to the cloudy heavens.\n\n**V**\nThe One True Master of Carefree Wandering,\nTruly a body drifting beyond the clouds.\nThe Three Heavens initiate numinous movement,\nThe Eight Poles revolve the stars.\nThe Mysterious Valley resounds with jade pendants,\nThe Jasper Pool feasts in lingering spring.\n\n**Thirty-Six Poems on the Work of Golden Elixir**\n*By Hunranzi*\n\n**I**\nA single drunkenness sheds the dusty yoke,\nPeaches of immortality bloom anew for a thousand years.\n\n**One**\nIn motion, stillness, sitting, lying—never stray from the center,\nWhen the time comes, spirit

Crone’s daughter,\nOn West Mountain, tiger captured and dragon pursued—home they come.\n\n**VII**\nFrom action to non-action, the path unfolds,\nNurturing the numinous embryo to enter the sage’s foundation.\nMock not the Daoist’s rare endeavor—\nEven men may give birth in reverse.\n\n**VIII**\nThe crane guards the elixir furnace, tending the Great Return,\nAs deep night’s moon fills the empty mountains.\nSeated in oblivion, unaware—pure as water,\nA thousand miles of autumn sky, a single expanse of tranquility.\n\n**IX**\nThe Dipper’s handle turns, the Celestial Pivot shifts,\nYang is drawn from Kan to mend the southern Li.\nWhen the Qian adept returns from gathering the medicine,\nOnly the sky’s light bathes the azure pool.\n\n**X**\nIn the stone chamber, smoke is swallowed; the Xun gate seals,\nThe Dipper’s handle held inverted, facing south.\nThe mountain’s scene differs from the mundane world—\nIn the sixth month, blossoms fly like cold white snow.\n\n**XI**\nThe numinous raft drifts on the tides of the sea,\nA whirlwind carries it ten thousand miles to the azure vault.\nThe Azure Dragon is captured and reared in the Yellow House,\nIts luminous pearl seized and fired within flame.\n\n**XII**\nLodging in Chang’e’s lofty lunar palace,\nAmid the fragrant osmanthus, autumn’s hairs are counted.\nThree hundred and sixty degrees of the celestial circuit—\nHalf an hour’s time to traverse them all.\n\n**XIII**\n\nAt the ocean’s depths, the mud ox transforms into a fire ox,\nThe Yellow Lad inverts his stride to mount Kunqiu.\nA flute plays one tune, returning late—\nMoonlit white, mountain green, autumn’s same hue.\n\n**XIV**\nSilent and continuous, guarding the Great Void,\nWalking or sitting, never leaving its stream.\nWhen the work of returning to the origin is complete,\nA mani pearl is nurtured forth.\n\n**XV**\nWithin Kan, one stroke is true lead;\nDrawn forth to mend Li’s palace, remaking Qian.\nThe talismanic fire returns to Kun’s crucible,\nThe numinous script gleams with fresh crimson radiance.\n\n**XVI**\nWithin the gourd, Kan and Li are ever paired,\nOne’s own landscape is known to oneself alone.\nAs the waning year meets the new spring’s arrival,\nOnce more the original Jiazi is reckoned.\n\n**XVII**\nEmpty the heart, still the will, silently lower the screen,\nNot a single thread of emptiness is permitted.\nWhen the myriad things arise, observe their return and transformation,\nThe Five Phases invert and revolve in ebb and flow.\n\n**XVIII**\nTo refine the adamantine, indestructible body,\nThree kinds of medicinal substances must be wholly true.\nIn one furnace, water and fire refine and boil them,\nThen one becomes a person atop Penglai’s peak.\n\n**XIX**\nAt the stirring of the first yang, gather true lead,\nTurn the celestial mechanism—the Dipper spins of itself.\nThrice advance, thrice retreat, with vigorous force,\nThe whole body ignites in flames that scorch the sky.\n\n**XX**\nThe Herdboy drives ten thousand miles across the Dark Gully,\nThe path is thick with yellow blossoms and purple mist.\nThe Weaver Girl invites him to cross the river,\nWithin the gourd lies yet another storied pavilion.\n\n**XXI**\nThe hornless ox treads upon purple clouds,\nAt the ridge’s crest, it harnesses the Peaceful Cart.\nSeeking the truth, it enters the Western Pool,\nGazing upon a thousand peach trees in bloom.\n\n**XXII**\nOf the union of Li and Kan, to whom may it be told?\nOne’s own message is known to oneself alone.\nHaving wandered the ends of the earth without other affairs,\nOne returns to the divine mountain to cultivate purple lingzhi.\n\n**XXIII**\nOver the sea, one has already ridden the yellow crane away,\nFrom the moon, the rabbit is seized and brought forth.\nThe celestial wind blows me back to Peng Island,\nTen thousand golden lotuses bloom in a single night.\n\n**XXIV**\nThe Mysterious Pass’s aperture is originally formless,\nYet birth as buddha or immortal is but a forced name.\nWith intent settled and unchanging, practice the two eights,\nThe great sound of boundless measure is the rare tone.\n\n**XXV**\nThere is a thing formed before heaven and earth,\nLofty and independent, transcending all.\nThe Crimson Chart unfurls, illuminating the Three Luminaries,\nIn the Dragon Han’s spring, the Jiazi year returns.\n\n**XXVI**\nAt midnight, the Wooden Lad roams the eastern sea,\nA wheel of fire rises, riding the dragon in reverse.\nAfter paying court to the Southern Emperor,\nOne sits and watches celestial blossoms, no Xun wind stirring.\n\n**XXVII**\nBehind closed doors, in pure stillness, recite the *Nanhua*,\nThe Dragon Maiden, floating, drives a chariot of colors.\nGracefully, she descends through the pearl-gate,\nA wisdom wind scatters the clouds of dawn.\n\n**XXVIII**\nThe Metal Lord rides a qilin from the ocean’s depths,\nMounting Kunlun, treading upon purple clouds.\nBy the Vermilion Sparrow Bridge, he meets the Alchemical Maiden,\nReturning together to pay homage to the Peaceful Lord.\n\n**XXIX**\nAt the first crow of the golden rooster, when Gui is born,\nThe Dipper turns, the Silver River shifts in order.\nFrom the Yin position it begins, to the Shen position it ends,\nThe returning wind blends all, forming the foundation of the elixir.\n\n**XXX**\nWholly essence, wholly qi, and wholly spirit,\nThis is the indestructible body of cultivation.\nIf one attains the true fire’s crucible,\nOne roams the Three Realms and enters the Golden Gate.\n\n**XXXI**\nIn the lead furnace, the Great Elixir is nurtured and congeals,\nBetween the crescents, before and after, the two eights pause.\nFrom this point, there is no need to tend the fire’s timing,\nAt Qujiang’s heights, one delights in the verdant mountains.\n\n**XXXII**\nThe Green Lad and White Maiden, each to the west and east,\nRely wholly on the Yellow Matron to unite their work.\nOnce led back to the grotto’s abode,\nCloudy passion and rainy intent are most harmonious.\n\n**XXXIII**\nThe two eights of vajra mount the fire wheel,\nThe Yellow River inverts and pours down Kunlun.\nWith a single stroke of the wisdom blade, emptiness is split,\nThe Three Corpses and Six Thieves’ souls are annihilated.\n\n**XXXIV**\nThe Golden Elixir’s great medicine is not hard to know,\nSpirit descends to fumigate, qi ascends to shift.\nMost wondrous is this singular marvel—\nThe mountain-burning talisman seizes the celestial mechanism.\n\n**XXXV**\nAn extraordinary person imparts to me the returning elixir’s secret,\nReturning to Dan Mountain to test and refine it.\nIn a single breath, dragon and tiger contend,\nThunder and lightning shake the celestial gates of the nine skies.\n\n**XXXVI**\nTo cultivate the truth, first refine body and mind,\nA segment of celestial mechanism, profound in wondrous principle.\nTurn these hinges of the pass,\nYellow mud and black stone transform into gold.\n\n**XXXVII**\nUpon the mountain’s rise, gather the medicinal sprouts,\nFire concealed in earth, burning within water.\nIn ebb and flow, take care to guard,\nAs if crossing a single-log bridge over a precipice.\n\n**XXXVIII**\nIn learning immortality, do not pursue empty nothingness,\nTrue mercury and true lead are the original lineage.\nWu earth flows forth, Ji earth receives,\nRefined into a mass of purple-golden red.\n\n**XXXIX**\nDisciples all recite the oral chan,\nYet when asked of true chan, they fall silent.\nHow could they know my true creation?\nThe sun rises in the east and sets in the west.\n\n**XL**\nThe furnace bellows fan the wind, fire reddens of itself,\nThe earthen cauldron’s broth boils, waves churn the void.\nRaven’s liver and hare’s marrow are simmered together,\nRefining the numinous elixir in a single breath’s work.\n\n**XLI**\nMy great Dao is originally without marvel,\nBefore the bamboo-striking cliff, the black turtle is summoned.\nFire compels metal to move, inverting and turning,\nA single tiger’s roar, snowflakes fly.\n\n**XLII**\nTo gather lead, one must align with the celestial mechanism,\nAttend carefully to essence’s ascent, step by step.\nWu and Ji return to the origin, Geng and Jia unite,\nThe Metal Lord embraces the Jade Toad and returns.\n\n**XLIII**\nRefine essence into qi, qi into spirit,\nSpirit and qi harmonize as child and mother.\nThe more it is refined, the firmer the elixir ripens,\nEach time it is raised, it is renewed.\n\n**XLIV**\nThe Magpie Bridge’s reflection in the crimson sunset,\nThe Three Passes along the spine open a single path.\nMastering the two true wondrous uses,\nExternally gathering medicine, internally achieving fusion.\n\n**XLV**\nExternal medicine employs great transformation,\nThe internal elixir’s nurturing requires no action.\nWhen the time comes, a silent return conveys the message,\nThe footless lad inverts and ascends the ladder.\n\n**XLVI**\nThere are those deluded who falsely transmit,\nSealing essence, lewd women, and drawing lead.\nIf this is called the elixir’s medicine,\nIt would make the immortals of the Great Brahma Heaven laugh.\n\n**XLVII**\nThe Dao does not depart from the heart—Gui is lead,\nTo gather lead, first secure the central field.\nThe original spirit often turns through the Three Passes,\nDrawing the host of perfected beings into the grotto heaven.\n\n**XLVIII**\nWithin the grotto’s pure and void qi, the golden embryo takes form,\nNurturing the numinous root to raise the perfected child.\nAfter ten months, the embryo sheds—spirit transforms of itself,\nAtop the crown, a thunderous crack bursts forth with a single sound.\n\n**XLIX**\nThe original spirit is the true master of the house,\nIn an instant, it harmonizes yin and yang.\nThe ten poles’ flying perfected ones join their strength,\nAll come to chew the void in a single mouthful.\n\n**L**\nThe single nature, perfectly penetrating, is already complete—\nWhy spend all day painfully poring over scriptures?\nEvery sutra merely opens the path to awakening,\nOnly teaching all beings not to dull their numinous essence.\n\n**LI**\nThose of the Dao secure their root and origin,\nThe upper pass stirs, the lower pass opens.\nTo know where heaven and earth find their dwelling,\nAll lies within the wordless, silent return.\n\n**LII**\nThe front pass is deeply sealed, the rear pass opens wide,\nPine winds from ten thousand valleys surge through the crown.\nFire blazes, smoke soars, the golden crucible splits—\nThe brocade-maned lion roars with the thunder of spring.\n\n**LIII**\nA pearl the size of a millet grain hangs at the center,\nIts light descending from earth, five *zhang* in length.\nAdvancing fire, withdrawing tally—the heavens turn left,\nDragon essence and phoenix marrow transform into the mysterious yellow.\n\n**LIV**\nIn cultivating the true, first take nature as the foundation,\nOnly upon seeing nature does one begin the work of refining life.\nKnow the time for medicinal substances, diligently gather them,\nNaturally, spirit and qi merge into profound unity.\n\n**LV**\nWithin the crescent-moon furnace, the great return is refined,\nThe five phases mutually overcome one another to form the elixir.\nHalf a watch’s journey brings one to the path home—\nTiger’s roar and dragon’s cry are of another kind.\n\n**LVI**\nThe five thieves assail the heart, creating obstacles,\nOne must fiercely and resolutely stabilize the central plain.\nFrom of old, the immortal’s Dao has no many methods—\nShattering the void requires but a single fist.\n\n**LVII**\nWood and metal stand apart—tiger and dragon race,\nAdvancing fire begins with the first line, then follows in order.\nThe mute man bites his tongue at the third watch,\nFew know the flavor within.\n\n**LVIII**\nMy home lies in the southwest, originally Kun,\nBehind, a path leads through to Kunlun.\n\n**LIX**\nThe divine water of the Flowery Pond is poured in ceaseless streams,\nCultivating golden blossoms that birth purple clouds.\n\n**LX**\nWithout a master’s transmission, do not sit in meditation—\nEven a heart turned to ash or wood withers in vain.\nWho knows the secret of talismanic fire and the returning elixir?\nA single moment’s turning of the mechanism spins a year.\n\n**LXI**\nTo forge the illusory body of floating life into strength,\nThe initial foundation of effort is the root.\nOnly when cinnabar is refined to ripeness in the golden furnace\nIs one permitted to abide in non-action and guard the natural.\n\n**LXII**\nThe maiden and the infant are but metaphors,\nThe Yellow Dame too is but a figment of intent.\nThe true message pierces mountains and penetrates stone—\nWithout stepping beyond the gate, one knows all things.\n\n**LXIII**\nMouth-bound samadhi needs no discussion,\nFor lofty discourse shuts the door on itself.\nEven if words flow swiftly, the heart remains unenlightened—\nIn the end, one merely toys with essence and spirit.\n\n**LXIV**\nUnversed in scriptures, unconcerned with Chan,\nOne simply revolves the three natures through the three fields.\nWhen the elixir of immortality is refined in the jade furnace,\nOne becomes a minor immortal of Penglai.\n\n**LXV**\nThe celestial mechanism is not distant, the medicine not remote—\nStir the celestial pivot, and earth responds like the tide.\nA single breath of dark sincerity ascends the great Dao,\nThe numinous elixir congeals, forged within the fire.\n\n**LXVI**\nThe immortal’s Dao is most simple, most easy,\nYet rare to encounter, rare to hear even half a word.\nIf one receives the true master’s oral transmission,\n\"My life is in my hands, not heaven’s.\"\n\n**LXVII**\nThe bellows’ gate opens, the wind of Xun stirs,\nFrom the deep pool emerges a crimson wheel.\nLifting one’s gaze, the path to the azure heavens lies near—\nAlone, one carries the golden toad into the jade palace.\n\n**LXVIII**\nThe primordial beginning hangs suspended like a millet-grain pearl,\nIts flowing light enters the sea to form a golden scripture.\nThe numinous and true ascend, floating through the void,\nAll sages gather to convene at the jade pivot.\n\n**LXIX**\nSeizing the tiger and capturing the dragon into the jade flask,\nThe Dao’s loftiness naturally draws the aid of ghosts and spirits.\nOne need not distinguish self from others—\nTo transcend death and surpass life is the mark of a true man.\n\n**LXX**\nThe path ahead is short, the path behind is long,\nStraight up the capital mountain, one meets the Jade Emperor.\nAfter feasting in the Jasper Pool, returning to the grotto palace,\nOne is bestowed a name and appointed Lord of Thunder.\n\n**LXXI**\nWhen fierce demons and specters suddenly deceive,\nThey repeatedly lead one into illusion and delusion.\nWith a single flourish of the fire-pen, golden lightning strikes—\nThe ten directions and three realms all submit.\n\n**LXXII**\nAt times, one joins the assembly of immortals in the nine palaces,\nRiding a jade-green chariot drawn by flying dragons in the cinnabar clouds.\nThe primordial spirit turns back beneath the capital mountain—\nA single moon hangs above the terrace, illuminating the azure sky.\n\n**LXXIII**\nDo not dismiss the elixir’s refinement as empty words—\nA day’s work makes a day’s immortal.\nIf one further aids others and upholds sagely transformation,\nWhat worry is there that this body will not ascend to heaven?\n\n**LXXIV**\nWith fierce awakening and steadfast resolve, one sees the truth intimately,\nThe *Yinfu* returns thrice to refine form and spirit.\nCirculating once, the void shatters—\nA thousand miles without clouds, the moon’s light renewed.\n\n**LXXV**\nThe four seas are at peace, the nation is naturally secure,\nWhen one ruler embodies the Dao, ten thousand ministers stand in awe.\nAt such a time, only civil influence is needed—\nWhy resort to arms and subdue the barbarians?\n\n**LXXVI**\nThe path between heaven and earth is not remote—\nRiding a deer in the Dark Capital, one ascends the azure heavens.\nThe phoenix flute’s melody enters the Palace of Heng’e,\nA myriad measures of pure fragrance, osmanthus seeds drift.\n\n**LXXVII**\nA single silence, a turn of inner light—all phenomena dissolve,\nUnknowing, one dwells in the crystal palace.\nThe message within holds no excess—\nPiercing stone and traversing mountains, every path is open.\n\n**LXXVIII**\nThe immortal’s wondrous secret is not lightly spoken,\nOnly those of steadfast faith are entrusted with its transmission.\nOnce these distinctions are made clear,\nWith every step, the cart remains beneath heaven.\n\n**LXXIX**\nSage after sage transmits but a single heart,\nOne who receives this heart’s transmission is a true kindred spirit.\nThough one peruses all books, no trace remains—\nYet one penetrates earth and sky, shining through the ages.\n\n**LXXX**\nTen thousand volumes of elixir scriptures point to the mysterious chapter,\nEach line compels one to seek its profundity.\nIf one is willing to delve deeply into its core,\nWhich household’s gate will not face heaven?\n\n**LXXXI**\nWhen the elixir is perfected through nine revolutions, one naturally surpasses the multitude,\nWith merit complete and the path fulfilled, one moves the Emperor of Heaven.\nA single imperial edict descends in broad daylight—\nThe body soars in purple mist to pay homage at the golden gate.\n\n*Nineteen Songs of Wandering Immortals*\n\n**II**\nWith lute in sack, I wander far to Wu-yi’s range,\nCrossing Slow Pavilion Peak’s high crest.\nA single note from iron flute pierces the bright moon,\nAs pine winds rise—autumn sweeps ten thousand hills.\n\n**III**\nA barefoot, tousled, carefree immortal,\nClad in hemp robe, bamboo staff, and cloth-bound feet.\nToday I chance through Zhongling’s market,\nLaughing as I clap shoulders with Hong Ya.\n\n**IV**\nYou mock my journey through Chu’s mountains,\nYet jade grass and coral blooms stir endless delight.\nThe dharma drum still beats at midnight,\nAs the golden crow soars—crimson floods sea and sky.\n\n**V**\nNo soft red dust clings to my staff’s tip,\nFor I am one who dwells on Penglai’s summit.\nA blue bird brings word from beyond the clouds—\nPeach blossoms of the coiled tree have bloomed for millennia.\n\n**VI**\nPalm of the immortal, Dragon Gate’s purple haze entwined,\nWhere Huashan’s heights touch the azure heavens.\nNo mortal treads beneath Lotus Peak—\nI sleep deep in the heart of white clouds.\n\n**VII**\nRefined, my body light as I ride purple clouds,\nTo Huayang Cave I pay homage to Lord Mao.\nIn night’s chill, only the moon before the crag,\nIts light revealing how the plum blossoms have thinned.\n\n**VIII**\nBound for Danqiu to seek the Five Cities,\nBeneath the jade peach’s boughs I sit and play the sheng.\nEast wind and Ma Gu’s wine leave me drunk—\nAsleep by the eastern window till dawn’s glow.\n\n**IX**\nWhite clouds ever cling to Yuewang Terrace,\nMountains deep as indigo, waters like moss.\nJade trees bloom and fade,\nWhile apes and cranes await my return.\n\n**X**\nYears spent dwelling in famed mountains—who can count?\nFive Lakes’ winds and moon are but a misty cloak.\nSometimes returning late from gathering herbs,\nI sit alone by pine roots, rinsing mouth with stone spring.\n\n**XI**\nHaving read the *Yellow Court’s Inner Radiance*,\nJiuhua’s peaks glow emerald in the rain.\nBefore my hut, I’ve planted towering pines—\nThey say with age, their roots yield slender lingzhi.\n\n**XII**\nLangfeng soars above Chicheng’s rosy clouds,\nIn the mountains, days stretch into years.\nThe immortal child scorns mortal fare—\nThis year, the dates ripen as large as melons.\n\n**XIII**\nBeyond green mountains, a path through clouds reaches the heavens,\nMoonlight limpid, shimmering in the azure void.\nFrom whence does Dong the immortal maiden fly?\nIn the jade tower, deep in night, she plays her flute alone.\n\n**XIV**\nRed cliffs stretch far to the earth immortal’s home,\nWhere osmanthus groves lock in emerald haze.\nPlowing stone fields, I sow only jade—\nSpring rains awaken golden sprouts across the hills.\n\n**XV**\nA yellow lad bearing a staff, deer drawing his cart,\nThrough Xuanpu’s peaks he enters the Emperor’s domain.\nButterflies like fans flutter wide,\nAs spring winds unfurl brocade blossoms through the city.\n\n**XVI**\nTinkling pendants, feathered robes light,\nBeyond kalpas, the spirit roams from Jade Capital.\nAt the twelve towers, wind flows like water,\nGreen waves surge through ten thousand pines.\n\n**XVII**\nGathering herbs, I thread the forest, cross perilous peaks,\nWind harmonizes with the stream’s murmuring flow.\nPenglai lies but within the azure void—\nStone caves’ layered gates stand unbarred through the night.\n\n**XVIII**\nMountain trees exhale celestial fragrance,\nWithin the gourd, tiered towers form an imperial realm.\nOnce at Yaochi, worldly thoughts dissolve—\nLeisurely clouds, flowing waters, beneath a pale moon.\n\n**XIX**\nAs dusk falls, pearl curtains open on every side,\nMoonlight and flower shadows ascend the towers.\nA strain of flute drifts through the clouds—\nSurely it is Zi Jin of Hou Mountain come.\n\n**XX**\nIn Yang Valley, spring brightens the jade halls,\nThe Queen Mother of Donghua feasts with crystal cups.\nDeep in night, the wine spent, we part beneath the moon,\nAs paired phoenix pipes sound—riding cranes, we return.\n\n*Eleven Lyrics to

      "translated_text": "**The Return to True Nature Collection**\n\n**Title:** *The Return to True Nature Collection* (*Huanzhen Ji*). Compiled by Wang Jie (courtesy name Daoyuan) of the Yuan dynasty. Three scrolls. Based on the edition from the *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity*, Supreme Mystery Section.\n\n**Preface to *The Return to True Nature Collection***\n\nThe Dao of immortality has been esteemed since antiquity. When the Yellow Emperor sought the Way from Guangchengzi, the world came to revere the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, for Guangchengzi was none other than Laozi himself. The discourse on immortality began thus, with figures such as Jian Keng of the Tang, Xiaofu of the Xia, Wanqiu of the Shang, and Wang Qiao of the Zhou—immortals who were already present in the Three Dynasties. Yet it was during the reign of King Mu of Zhou, who built a thatched pavilion to receive scholars, that such teachings first became prominent.\n\nBy the time of the First Emperor of Qin and Emperor Wu of Han, rulers were deluded by the arts of alchemists and physicians. Though men like Wang Cijiong and Dongfang Shuo did not follow true masters, their heterodox doctrines spread and became entangled, ultimately leading to their own downfall. Thus, the great scholars and eminent minds of the age arose to censure them, and rightly so.\n\nThen came Wei Boyang of the Han, who modeled his *Triple Concordance* (*Cantong Qi*) after the *Book of Changes*, expanding upon the *Ancient Text of the Dragon and Tiger Classic* to elucidate the path of elixir refinement. He steered clear of the misguided practices of ingesting minerals, herbs, clouds, or mists, or relying on breathwork and physical regimens. Instead, he illuminated the natural principles of body, mind, spirit, and *qi*, employing the trigrams, hexagrams, and celestial markers as his measures. All aligned perfectly with the marvelous interplay of odd and even, images and numbers.\n\nLater, Zhongli Quan transmitted these teachings to Lü Yan of the Tang, who upheld and expounded upon them. Through his songs, discourses, and debates, he largely restored the true intent of the tradition, and worthy successors have not been lacking in subsequent ages. In the Song dynasty, figures such as Zhang Ziyang, Shi Yaolin, Chen Niuwan, Bai Ziqing, Li Yuxi, and Li Qing’an all stood as paragons of their time. Their writings and doctrines were no less profound than those of Boyang, and in some cases, they achieved even deeper, wordless understanding.\n\nThough separated by a thousand years, how is it that their words align as if tallying tokens? It is not by coincidence but by necessity. The principle remains the same across a thousand generations, as does the heart-mind. What diverges and causes confusion must be the false and deceptive doctrines—those that seek to impress the present or mislead future generations. How could they ever accord with the natural Way of body, mind, spirit, and *qi*?\n\nThus, the ancients insisted on transmitting the Dao only to the worthy, for the Way does not propagate in vain. Moreover, masters do not recklessly reveal their profound and hidden mysteries. As for students, if they lack the substance of accumulated merit and cultivated conduct, merely adorning themselves with empty formalities and false reputations, chasing fame and acclaim, how can they be spoken of in the same breath as the Dao? How could they ever give voice to its truths?\n\nThe Master of Chaotic Oneness of Xiujiang in Nanchang, having abandoned his former surname, was a man of vast learning. He once encountered an extraordinary person from whom he received secret transmissions, and he diligently set forth his discourses. I have long studied his words, and though we met briefly in a guest lodge, haste prevented me from fully exploring their depths. This spring, my disciple Yuan Wenyi returned from Wu, bringing with him the *Return to True Nature Collection* compiled by the master, and asked me to compose a preface.\n\nAfter savoring its contents repeatedly, I find it truly conveys the essence of the golden elixir and the returning cinnabar. Its exposition of the subtle and the manifest, the fundamental and the functional, is such that one may grasp both principle and application. If one cultivates accordingly, even those who come after may rival Ziyang or Qing’an—who can say who will surpass whom?\n\nMoreover, I have long lamented the superficial, reckless, and perverse habits of the age, which have spread and festered without end. Yet I rejoice that these words are sufficient to revitalize the decadence of our era. If steadfast scholars and upright individuals can discern the difference between jade and mere stone, then roaming the primordial radiance of the spirit’s inception or refining *qi* beyond the chaotic vastness of the primordial void will not be difficult. This is how one fully returns to the origin and comprehends the end, exhausting the divine and knowing transformation.\n\nPerhaps one day, I may summon the yellow crane to descend from the empty skies, and together we shall discourse amidst the isles and peaks of the Xiang and Yue rivers—it is not too late. This book is presented here at the outset in anticipation of that day.\n\nWritten in the fifth month of summer, the *ren-shen* year of the Hongwu reign.\nPreface by Zhang Yuchu, the Celestial Master.\n\n**The Return to True Nature Collection, Scroll One**\nCompiled by the Master of Chaotic Oneness.",

      "translated_text": "**The Marvelous Principles of the Golden Elixir**\n\nThree points like stars—its principle runs deep,\nA hook suspends the moon’s arc, fixing rise and fall.\nShould one awaken to this mystery within the mystery,\nThe mountains and rivers of the earth all turn to gold.\n\nThe Dao’s wonder within the mystery knows no bounds,\nThe three teachings transmit but a single mystery.\nGrasp the true workings hidden within,\nAs crow flies and hare runs, never leaving the heavens.\n\nThe Mysterious Pass—a single aperture at the center,\nNeither before nor behind, alone suspended in emptiness.\nSilently turn the light inward to dwell here,\nNaturally spirit and *qi* merge with the mystery as one.\n\nTwo jade rings linked in a pair,\n*Qian* revolves and *Kun* turns, sharing a single origin.\nWithin lies a single true message—\nWithout a master’s transmission, speak not idly of it.\n\nOne aperture enfolds the workings of creation,\nThree great medicines fuse within.\nThe *Xun* wind stirs the furnace’s fire,\nRefining the divine elixir till the crucible glows red.\n\nNurtured like an infant in the ten-month womb,\nThe work reaches this point, shedding worldly dust.\nSpiritual transformations manifest in all directions,\nA single orb of radiance pierces through the crown.\n\nBirthless and deathless, one attains the Golden Immortal,\nA single point of light illumines the great thousand worlds.\nShattering empty space, the whole body is revealed,\nReturning to the state before father and mother were born.\n\n**Oral Instructions**\nIn the study of the Dao, first one must clearly discern the true crucible and furnace within the body. Next, one must recognize the completeness of the medicinal substances. Third, one must understand the methods of advancing and retreating the firing times. Only when these are all distinctly clarified may one begin the practice of refinement.\n\nThe Patriarch said: \"Once you know where to begin, proceed from that very point.\" Some ask: \"What does it mean to proceed?\" Ah—this is the work itself. The principle of the work lies in unbroken practice through the twelve double-hours of the day and night. When the heart is empty and desireless, inwardly observe to cultivate one’s nature. When the winter solstice arrives and *gui* is born, then close the gates to restore one’s life. Internally, revolve the Celestial Stem without movement; externally, turn the Dipper’s handle to propel change. A single *qi* circulates throughout; the Three Primes return to the body. The true fire forges and refines, coalescing the golden embryo of empty *qi*—this is called the talismanic fire returning the elixir. With prolonged practice, it gradually congeals and solidifies, uniting with the great void and merging with the true Dao.\n\n**Direct Pointers to the Golden Elixir**\nThe Mysterious Pass—a single aperture within the human body,\nAbove the kidneys, below the heart, west of the liver, east of the lungs.\nNeither biased nor leaning, standing alone in emptiness,\nNeither inside nor outside, the origin of the primordial beginning.\nWithout desire, cultivate nature; with desire, apply effort.\nFan open the furnace bellows, stir the *Xun* wind.\nThunder roars at the sea’s bottom, startling the harbor dragon.\nFire flames in the *Kan* position, ascending to the *Li* palace.\nThe Yellow Dame leads the bride, marrying her to the Metal Lord.\nThe three families meet, their affections harmonious.\nThe elixir congeals through nine revolutions, the crucible filled with rosy radiance.\nDiligently gather, diligently refine, gradually congealing and enriching.\nUnceasingly guard with steadfastness, warding off danger in the wild battle.\nThe spiritual embryo nurtured, pure yang *qi* surges.\nEstablish merit and conduct, your name reaching the upper heavens.\nShedding the embryo, spirit transforms—endless are the Dao’s wonders.\n\n**The Three Treasures of the Human Body**\nThe Three Treasures of the Precelestial are the Three Substances—\nThe Dao of spontaneity:\nOriginal essence, original *qi*, original spirit.\n\nThe Three Treasures of the Postcelestial are the Three Functions—\nThe Dao of effort:\nCoital essence, breath *qi*, deliberative spirit.\n\nThe three treasures of the human body all arise from heaven and earth, residing in the precelestial to be born, their wondrous substance perfectly formed. In the postcelestial, they transform through the union of form and response. Without the precelestial, the postcelestial cannot be born; without the postcelestial, the precelestial cannot be completed. The principle of these two is one body differentiated—one must not lose the latter nor harm the former.\n\nThus, refine coital essence with original essence, refine breath *qi* with original *qi*, refine deliberative spirit with original spirit. When the three substances are perfectly fused, one merges with the true Dao. Naturally, original essence is firm and coital essence does not leak; original *qi* abides and breath *qi* does not escape; original spirit is whole and deliberative spirit does not arise.\n\nThe method of immortal cultivation has no other secret—it is simply to preserve these three. As the Patriarch said: \"When essence is whole, desire is not thought of; when *qi* is whole, food is not thought of; when spirit is whole, sleep is not thought of.\" It is also said: \"When the three are true and whole, one will surely ascend as an immortal; when the three are whole and true, one will surely ascend in flight.\" These words exhaust the matter—let the scholar savor them.\n\n**The Three Passes of the Human Body**\nSeize the *Kan* position to solidify the heart’s center...",

Though their forms in the Five Phases’ transformations are not uniform, their Dao is one. Thus, in heaven they become the five stars and the five emperors; on earth, the five sacred peaks and the five spirits; in the human, the five viscera and the five constants. Gathered into a single body, the Five Phases are therein as one. Scattered into the myriad forms, the Five Phases are also therein as one. Therefore, the essential practice of cultivating the Real consists solely in circulating these five qi. If one can preserve these five qi without dissipation, blending them into the Great Void, they coalesce into the golden embryo of empty qi—this is called the numinous elixir. But those who dull their spirit and chase after things are instead harmed by the Five Thieves.\n\nSome may ask: What are the Five Thieves?\nThe Five Thieves are the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and intent. Unless one is a person of the greatest spiritual capacity, one is seldom not deluded by these five and thus loses one’s nature.

      "translated_text": "Man weaves his great designs from the heart—\nFor the *Heart’s Ease* is the source of the Great Dao.\n\nThe Great Dao’s generation and transformation arise from nothing beyond the fifty-five numbers of the *River Chart*, which the sages took as their model. As Laozi said: *\"The nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth; the named is the mother of the myriad things.\"* The nameless beginning is the union of the Three and Five as one reality; the named mother is the division of the Three and Five into separate realities. Thus, that which is above form is called Heaven; that which is below form is called Earth; and that which arises between the two forms is called Man. Man, paired with Heaven and Earth, is called the Three Powers. When the Three Powers unite with the Dao, the myriad things are born of a single qi. Only Man receives the full essence of Heaven and Earth at birth: Heaven bestows spirit, Earth bestows essence, and the harmonious center bestows qi. These three are complete within the body, which is the undifferentiated Great Ultimate. As Master Zhou said: *\"From Non-Ultimate comes the Great Ultimate; the Great Ultimate moves and generates yang, rests and generates yin.\"* When yang’s movement reaches its extreme, it returns to stillness—yin embraces the bowels. When yin’s stillness reaches its extreme, it returns to movement—yang gathers yin. Yin and yang seek each other and generate the five qi; the five qi divide and transform to produce the eight trigrams; the eight trigrams cycle to form the four seasons; the four seasons revolve without cease to generate the myriad things. The myriad things flourish, each returning to its root. Such is the constant ease of the Great Dao.\n\nIn the language of the elixir path, this is nothing more than circulating the *Heart’s Ease*, inverting yin and yang, and reverting spirit and qi. Thus, Qian and Kun serve as the gates of the *Ease*; Kan and Li are the mechanism of the sun and moon’s coming and going; Zhen and Dui mark the spring and autumn equinoxes at Mao and You. When refining the elixir, internally one contains the Three and Five, firmly sealed and unmoving; externally, the Wood of the eastern Three engenders the Fire of the southern Two, and the Metal of the western Four engenders the Water of the northern One. The four images each return to their Five, then the central emptiness of the true Earth of Wu and Ji divides and transforms, drawing the raised Earth of Wu back to the Kan position. Wood is compelled to generate Fire, steaming and fuming; Metal is pressed to generate Water, seething and boiling. At this moment, one stirs the pivot at the crown, slowly drawing out the yang within Kan to replenish the yin of Li, forming the body of Qian. Using the Earth of Ji, one retreats the tally from the Li position, gathering the five qi to circulate the thirty numbers of the celestial cycle, halting only at the Kun palace. There the Reverted Elixir coalesces, Wu and Ji return to their places, and one drinks deeply of the knife and spoon. The singular nature becomes profoundly serene, the four qi grow limpid and bright, and the Five and Ten are once more emptied.\n\nThe *Diagram of the Great Ultimate* states: *\"The true of the Non-Ultimate, the essence of the Two and Five, wondrously unite and congeal.\"* This is the principle. Zhang Ziyang’s *Awakening to Reality* says:\n*\"Three, Five, and One—just these three words,\nRarely understood in ancient or modern times.\nThe eastern Three and southern Two together make Five;\nThe northern One and western Four share the same.*\n*Wu and Ji return to the generative Five;\nThe Three Families meet to form the Infant.\nThe Infant is the One containing true qi;\nAfter ten months, the embryo is complete, and one enters the foundation of the sage.\"*\nThese words exhaust the matter; let the student savor them.\n\n**Diagrams of Tun and Meng**\nThe two trigrams Tun and Meng are metaphors employed by the sages to illustrate the advance of fire and retreat of the tally. Yang ascends from below—this is Tun; yin retreats from above—this is Meng. Tun has Zhen below and Kan above: Zhen’s initial nine uses the Gengzi line, Kan’s six four uses the Wushen line. Meng has Kan below and Gen above: Kan’s initial six uses the Wuyin line, Gen’s six four uses the Bingxu line. The lines Zi, Shen, Yin, and Xu correspond to *yuan, heng, li,* and *zhen*. One trigram inverted becomes two trigrams, their bodies and functions interpenetrating, movement and stillness mutually dependent. Among the sixty-four hexagrams, each follows the same pattern. One hexagram has six lines; two hexagrams total twelve lines. In terms of a year, this corresponds to twelve months; in terms of a day, to twelve hours. Yang advances for six, yin retreats for six. The alchemical saying of \"morning Tun and evening Meng\" is merely a figurative way of discussing the clarity of fire times within the body, the subtleties of opening and closing, exhalation and inhalation.\n\nWei Boyang’s *Triplex Unity* states: *\"Tun uses Zi and Shen; Meng uses Yin and Xu. Each of the sixty hexagrams has its own day; I briefly present the two images, though I cannot exhaust them.\"* *Awakening to Reality* also says: *\"The Southern and Northern Schools reverse the hexagram images; morning and evening fire times align with the celestial pivot.\"* These words are clear. Yet students must not take mere words on paper as full understanding; they must seek a enlightened teacher’s guidance to recognize the hexagrams within their own bodies. The discourse on hexagrams is also a metaphor—it is only because the sages had no choice that they borrowed images to guide later students. Once the decisive word breaks through, the Dao of Heaven and Earth and the self will be in perfect resonance.\n\n**Diagram of the Celestial Cycle Fire Times**\nEleven\nThirty Spokes",

      "translated_text": "A single hub unites them all.\n\nThe Celestial Cycle Fire Times embody the mechanism of Qian and Kun’s opening and closing, the transformation of Yin and Yang. In the vastness of Heaven and Earth, in the smallness of the human body, all possess the numerical patterns of generative fire times. The *Book of Changes* states: *\"One opening, one closing is called change; ceaseless coming and going is called penetration.\"* Thus, in the human body, exhalation connects to the root of Heaven, inhalation to the root of Earth. Each exhalation and inhalation naturally harmonizes with the creative workings of Heaven and Earth. Yet this breath is not the breath of mouth and nose—it is the inner movement of a single vital breath. For this reason, the ancestral masters established words and images to guide those who would come after. Texts such as the *Scripture of Dragon and Tiger*, the *Triplex Unity*, and the *Six Hundred Fire Records* all elucidate the fire times, truly desiring that people practice this Dao.\n\nThus, a year is condensed into a month, a month into a day, a day into an hour, an hour into a single breath. Within the work of a single breath, one advances the Yang fire and retreats the Yin tally, seizing the three thousand six hundred breaths of primordial qi, reversing the seventy-two seasonal nodes at their crucial passes. A grain of millet-like pearl is produced, descending into the Yellow Court, where emptiness and fullness merge, the sacred qi congeals into truth, and the sacred embryo is formed—this is called the tally-fire returned elixir.\n\nZhang Ziyang said: *\"Without marking time to divide Zi and Wu, within the hexagrams and lines, Qian and Kun are determined.\"* Liao Zhenzi said: *\"The great medicine consists of three: essence, qi, and spirit; naturally, mother and child embrace one another. Returning wind and merging into the true body, the forging work renews day by day.\"* Master Shao also said: *\"When Qian meets Xun, observe the Moon’s Grotto; when Earth meets Thunder, tread the Heavenly Root. Freely coming and going between Heavenly Root and Moon’s Grotto, the thirty-six palaces are all spring.\"* These all elucidate the principles of fire times.\n\nPractitioners of the true, even if they possess the three impermeabilities yet do not practice the work of fire times, remain within Yin and will ultimately only produce a Yin spirit, unable to manifest a Yang spirit. Lü Chunyang thus spoke of the *\"clay in the kiln.\"* Yet clay in the kiln, unrefined by fire, remains mere earth—how can it become firm? The human body is likewise like clay in the kiln. Without practicing the work of fire times and refining the medicine, one will never achieve the wondrous union of form and spirit, merging with the Dao in truth.\n\nThus, the sages transmitted the medicine but not the fire—since ancient times, few have known the fire times. This is the ancestral masters’ untransmitted secret, not that it was not transmitted, but that it is only passed to those worthy of receiving it. How could it be spoken of lightly?\n\n**The Three Essentials of Internal Alchemy**\n1. The Crucible\n2. The Medicine\n3.

The essentials of cultivation are three: first, know the crucible; second, know the medicine; third, know the fire times. Only when these three are clearly understood may one begin the practice. Though their names vary endlessly, they are but different terms to dispel the learner’s confusion.\n\nThe crucible is the Heavenly Heart. The medicine is essence and qi. The fire times are spirit and qi. Within the twelve double-hours, turn the light inward, reflect, and maintain continuity as if barely present—like a hen brooding her eggs, like a dragon nurturing its pearl. Naturally, spirit governs qi, and qi nourishes spirit, merging within the heart to become one with the Great Void.\n\nAt such a time, there is no medicine, no fire times—one spirit is all spirits, one qi is all qi. Yet even so, the field of the heart and the sea of nature cannot remain eternally still. Stillness reaches its extreme and must move, giving rise to Yang. Yang is the winter solstice, the time when Gui is born within the human body. At this moment, one must close the gates and practice the fire times: stir the Xun wind, fan the furnace bellows, order the five qi, harmonize the hundred spirits, raise the Wu earth, seal Gen and Dui, draw forth the Yang within Kan to replenish the Yin within Li. Before the intent ceases, Wu gathers the medicine with Ji earth and returns it together, sending it into the crucible. The Xun gate opens on both sides, true fire refines it, and the golden elixir is formed, imperishable for ten thousand kalpas.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the more the elixir is refined, the firmer it becomes; the more the practice is accumulated, the deeper it grows. Diligently cultivating this, one may indeed hope for the Dao of immortality—how could this be empty words?\n\n*The Upper Scroll of the Return to the True concludes. The Middle Scroll of the Return to the True begins.*\n\n**On the Secret Essentials of the Returned Elixir**\nThe Returned Elixir is the Dao of returning to the root and restoring the origin. At birth, humans receive the father’s essence and mother’s blood, and in early infancy, the original essence, original qi, and original spirit are all perfectly whole. As one gradually matures, the four gates—eyes, ears, nose, and tongue—become enticed, and the single numinous true nature is touched by form, sound, fragrance, and taste, growing ever more deeply habituated. Day after day, year after year, the original essence transforms into generative essence, the original qi into breathing qi, and the original spirit into the spirit of thought and worry. These Three Origins dissipate, making it difficult to recover one’s celestial authenticity. Thus, the ancestral masters transmitted their teachings, recording them in the elixir classics to show people the methods of cultivation and restoration. If essence is depleted, replenish it with essence; if qi is depleted, replenish it with qi; if spirit is depleted, replenish it with spirit—this is the Dao of returning to the root and restoring the origin.\n\nWhat does \"restoration\" entail? It means taking the preservation of essence as the deep root, the preservation of qi as the firm stem, and the preservation of spirit as the wondrous union. If one can preserve these Three, they truly become the genuine medicinal substances within the body. Yet even so, without knowing the methods of applying the firing times and refining with fire, one remains bound to Yin and will never attain the Dao of perfecting both form and spirit.\n\nWho would have known that the human Dao aligns with Heaven and Earth? A single breath of effort seizes a year’s transformation from Heaven and Earth. Qian and Kun serve as the crucible and vessel; the sun and moon as water and fire; the crow and hare as the medicinal substances; Yin and Yang as the mechanism of transformation; the dragon and tiger as the wondrous function; Zi and Wu as the winter and summer solstices; Mao and You as the spring and autumn equinoxes. These are all metaphorical allusions—yet in truth, they do not extend beyond the three words: body, heart, and intent. The body is tied to essence, the heart to qi, and the intent to spirit.\n\n\"Return\" means reversing the course of these Three; \"restore\" means restoring these Three to their true state. When the Three are whole and united with the true, this is called the Returned Elixir. Fearing that learners might cling to one-sided views and fail to grasp this principle, I dare not fear heavenly retribution and must reveal this celestial mechanism.\n\nWhenever entering the chamber to refine the elixir, one must empty the heart and still the nature, merging spirit and qi within the Central Field. When the first Yang stirs—this is the winter solstice within the body. At this moment, one must close the gates, raise Wu earth to seal the depths of the sea abyss, and not rashly employ the hidden dragon. Only when the dragon appears in the field should one turn the pivot at the crown gate, slowly lifting it from the Great Mystery Palace. With one ascent, three hours pass, and the flying dragon penetrates the Three Passes; with another ascent, three more hours pass, and it ascends to the Southern Palace for union. This is drawing the Yang from Kan to replenish the Yin within Li. From Zi to Si, the six Yangs gather in Qian. Beyond this, Yang has no end in principle, yet a single Yin arises beneath the five Yangs, and Kun Yin takes charge. With Ji earth, one retreats the Yin tally from Li, descending the Magpie Bridge at the Golden Gate, entering the Crimson Palace through the Towering Chambers, and returning it to the earthen crucible. From Wu to Hai, the six Yin tallies complete. Yang reclaims Kun’s position, the Xun gate opens on both sides, and true fire refines it, forming the golden embryo of empty qi—this is called the Returned Elixir.\n\nRefining the medicine in accordance with the times, applying the tallies in harmony with the cycles, diligently tempering and refining, transforming the insubstantial into substance—after ten months of work, the embryo is perfected, the crucible is changed, and the spirit is moved to dwell in the Mud Pill Palace. The Heavenly Gate bursts open, and one carefully nurtures the emerging spirit. At this time, one must stand firmly on solid ground, not erring by even a hair’s breadth. Only when spiritual powers are fully rounded and transformations are free will one penetrate stone and pass through metal, respond to circumstances as they arise, roam the clouds at ease, and enjoy boundless joy—attaining the status of a true immortal who transcends the kalpas, all through resolute cultivation.\n\nThe wondrous function of elixir refinement begins with effort and ends in effortlessness. Nature is established upon life, and life is cultivated through nature. When nature and life merge, they become one with the Great Void—what bondage of life and death could remain? This is the unchanging great method transmitted by the sages. To seek other wonders beyond this is to stray into heterodox paths.\n\nSome may cut off thoughts to guard emptiness, or abstain from grain to starve the body; some may fix their minds in silent audience, or swallow mist and inhale qi; some may practice massage and guiding exercises, or imagine fire burning the navel; some may choose beautiful women as crucibles and vessels, prizing unyielding virility as victory in battle; some may take female essence as the elixir’s head, using the union of yin and yang as their wondrous function; some may enter the chamber at Zi and Wu hours to sit in meditation, or refrain from firing times during Mao and You months—such minor paths number in the thousands. These are all side doors and narrow trails; how could they be worthy of discussion as the Dao?\n\nThe ancestral masters said: \"The Dao has three thousand six hundred gates, and each person clings to one as their root. Yet within these, the subtle and mysterious essence lies beyond the three thousand six hundred gates.\" These words say it all. Learners must be careful not to cling and thus delude themselves. Have you not heard the ancients say: \"If one does not meet a true master at the outset, one will grow old and become a mere antique\"?\n\nThe essentials of cultivating the true lie in exhaustively investigating principle and fully realizing nature, investigating things to extend knowledge, and only then returning to the root and restoring life—only thus can one verify the great Dao. Without seeking a true teacher’s guidance, even with the talents of Yan or Min, one will not succeed. Let the learner ponder this.\n\n**On the Fusion of Nature and Life**\nNature is the single numinous spirit within the human body. Life is the single original Yang true qi within the human body. Life does not arise without nature, and nature does not stand without life. Before the parents’ birth, the spirit was contained within the empty qi alone—luminous and clear, lacking nothing, with nothing in excess.",
      "overlap_context": "ment, one must close the gates and practice the fire times: stir the Xun wind, fan the furnace bellows, order the five qi, harmonize the hundred spirits, raise the Wu earth, seal Gen and Dui, draw forth the Yang within Kan to replenish the Yin within Li. Before the intent ceases, Wu gathers the medicine with Ji earth and returns it together, sending it into the crucible. The Xun gate opens on both sides, true fire refines it, and the golden elixir is formed, imperishable for ten thousand kalpas.",

      "translated_text": "After the parents’ birth, the single original true qi resides between the two kidneys, within the empty and mysterious aperture—here life is established, and here too nature lodges in the body. Establishing nature and establishing life, this is called the \"Heavenly Heart,\" also known as \"Heaven’s mandate as nature.\" Nature is the master of the entire human body; life is its root. In daily activity, responding to the myriad affairs depends on nature, while accomplishing the hundred tasks belongs to the body. Nature enables the activation of subtle transformations; life enables the transmutation of yin and yang. When nature responds to things, life serves as its substance and nature as its function; when life operates and transforms, nature serves as its substance and life as its function. Substance and function share a single source, manifest and subtle without separation—only then can it be called the Dao. Neither can be lacking.\n\nThe Dao of refining the returning elixir is nothing more than the fusion of spirit and qi, restoring the original wholeness of nature and life. The substance of nature is Qian; the substance of life is Kun. The primordial Qian belongs to metal; the primordial Kun belongs to earth. Qian metal resides within Kun earth and is concealed—mother and child guard one another, with nature as the child and life as the mother. As the alchemical classics say, \"Let it be the host and I the guest,\" thus borrowing the body as the host’s function.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"Great indeed is the primordial Qian, from which all things receive their beginning\"—this is nature. \"Profound indeed is the primordial Kun, from which all things receive their birth\"—this is life. The *Dao De Jing* says: \"Always be desireless to observe its mystery\"—this is the substance of nature in Qian. \"Always have desire to observe its manifestations\"—this is the function of life in Kun. Qian and Kun are the gateways of the *Changes*, and truly the root and origin of the substance and function of nature and life.\n\nNature and life are spirit and qi; spirit and qi are lead and mercury; lead and mercury are Kan and Li; Kan and Li are the sun and moon; the sun and moon are water and fire. When water and fire achieve balance, wondrously uniting and congealing, this is the Dao of the fusion of nature and life.\n\nAt the moment of their fusion, the heart is empty and luminously clear, without form or name, without substance or function. When nature and life emanate and ascend, yang moves and yin separates—there is form and name, substance and function. At this point, practicing the *Scripture of the Numinous Treasure for Salvation*, substance and function then divide into inner and outer. Internally, nature resides in the Central Palace and governs movement—this is substance. Externally, the emotions circulate with the Dipper’s handle in cyclic return—this is function. Preserve it with sincerity, employ it with truth, and naturally the elixir will form in the crucible, nurturing the sacred embryo. Like an infant in the womb, after ten months the qi is complete, the embryo sheds its form through spiritual transformation, a body exists beyond the body, and the perfected one appears—thus the great task of dual cultivation of nature and life is accomplished.\n\nAll those who study the Dao and attain the Way, along with eminent Chan practitioners, must not cling rigidly; only through the dual cultivation of nature and life can the great task be achieved. Master Lü said: \"Cultivating only the golden elixir without cultivating nature is the foremost illness in practice. Only understanding true nature without refining the elixir—even after ten thousand kalpas, the radiant spirit will hardly enter sagehood.\" These words say it all.\n\nIf one cultivates only nature without life, after the body’s death, nature becomes a yin spirit and cannot manifest spiritual powers. If one cultivates only life without nature, though the body may achieve longevity, it remains bound to form and cannot transcend the kalpas. Both are cases of solitary yin or solitary yang, falling into the study of lopsided desiccation.\n\nWhat then is the dual cultivation of nature and life? Have you not heard: \"Comprehending nature leads to sagehood—this heart connects with all hearts, wisdom is vast, and nothing that comes is unknown.\" \"Comprehending life leads to longevity—this body endures through kalpas unharmed, able to transform all forms, and nowhere it goes is it not transformed.\" Only when nature and life are both complete is the Dao attained; only when form and spirit are both wondrous is the golden immortal realized. What doubt can there be? What doubt can there be?\n\n**On Curbing Anger and Restraining Desire**\nCurbing anger and restraining desire are the essentials of the sage’s self-cultivation and careful conduct. Curbing anger is to discipline the heart; restraining desire is to halt thoughts. Disciplining the heart prevents anger from arising; halting thoughts prevents desire from emerging. When anger does not arise, the heart is naturally clear; when desire does not emerge, the emotions are naturally still. With a clear heart and still nature, the Dao naturally congeals.\n\nThus, the noble one who cultivates this prospers; the petty person who violates it meets misfortune. How can one not know: if anger is not curbed, the heart’s fire flames upward, and the celestial nature is obscured by clouds. If desire is not restrained, the yang essence rushes downward, and the bitter sea’s waves surge. Thus, one drifts in the realm of life and death, sinking into the depths of love and desire—then the true unified qi originally bestowed by Heaven and Earth stealthily flees and lodges in Kun.\n\nProceeding thus, Kun rides Qian’s solitary yang to become Kan, while Qian, broken by Kun, loses its solitary yang to become Li. Li accumulates yin and generates anger; Kan accumulates yang and generates desire. Examine this: anger arises from qi, desire from essence. When qi stirs, anger gives rise to greed and hatred; when essence stirs, desire clings to delusion and attachment. Externally, one clashes and grinds against things; internally, one’s own spirit and essence dissipate, falling into the dark paths and forever losing the true Dao—how lamentable!\n\nThus, I record the words of the ancient sages as a mirror for later learners. The Most High said: \"Attain utmost emptiness, maintain profound stillness, and while the myriad things arise together, I observe their return.\" The *Book of Changes* states: \"Return—is this not the manifestation of Heaven and Earth’s heart?\" Gautama said: \"Do not give rise to the mind in response to form, sound, fragrance, taste, touch, or dharma; give rise to the mind without abiding anywhere.\" He also said: \"All that has form is illusory; if one sees that all forms are not form, one sees the Tathāgata.\" Confucius said: \"The Dao is that from which one cannot depart even for a moment; what can be departed from is not the Dao.\" He also said: \"Rectify the heart, sincerely cultivate the will, and do not, even for the time of a meal, depart from benevolence.\"",

It is nurtured with uprightness and suffers no harm.\"\n\nAll these exemplify the Dao of curbing wrath and restraining desire to preserve the Great Harmony. In the alchemical tradition, this is the principle of \"drawing from Kan to fill Li,\" the regulation of Water and Fire in perfect balance; in the Chan tradition, it is the principle of \"turning the light inward to reflect,\" transforming the passions of the material world into emptiness; in the Confucian tradition, it is the principle of \"mastering oneself to return to ritual propriety,\" rectifying the heart and sincerely cultivating the will.\n\nThus considered, the Three Teachings share the same Dao though their names differ; in truth, they do not depart from the wondrous workings of the single heart. Therefore, Heaven and Earth possess no second Dao, and the sages harbor no dual hearts.

      "translated_text": "Dreams, in their essence, arise from the transformations of qi. When yang governs yin, the hun spirit restrains the po soul, and if the spirit dreams, it is luminous and clearly perceived. When yin governs yang, the po soul restrains the hun spirit, and the spirit becomes obscured by worldly desires—thus dreams wander in confusion, dim and indistinct.\n\nOf old, the Divine Farmer, grieving over the people’s suffering, dreamed of ascending to the celestial court, where the Heavenly Sovereign bestowed upon him the book of herbal testing. The Yellow Emperor, yearning for the Dao, dreamed of wandering the land of Huaxu’s grand palace. Zhuang Zhou discoursed on the Dao and thus dreamed of transforming into a butterfly. Confucius praised the *Zhouyi* and thus dreamed of meeting the Duke of Zhou. In these sages, the heart and the Dao were profoundly united; their dreams arose from resonance, their yang spirit blazing through the host of yin. Bright and radiant, though dreams, they were not mere dreams—such is the wondrous work of the spirit emergent. Thus, the dreams of ordinary people are worlds apart.\n\nThe hearts of ordinary people cling to their affairs, drifting upon the sea of desire, sinking into the river of attachment. How could they know that the single spark of original spirit, by day, dwells in the head? The eyes covet forms, and the spirit is stained by them—this is the dream within the eyes. The ears covet sounds, and the spirit is stained by them—this is the dream within the ears. The nose covets fragrances, and the spirit clings to them—this is the dream within the nose. The mouth covets flavors, and the spirit is stained by them—this is the dream within the mouth. By night, the spirit returns to nest in the heart; as soon as sleep comes, the yin po envelops the hun, and dreams become turbid and chaotic, seeing all manner of things, upside-down and inverted, shifting with every thought. Thus, whether eyes are open or closed, dreams arise.\n\nThis is because the field of the heart is impure, and the spirit does not abide in its chamber. Day by day, month by month, the essence and spirit dissipate, and so one falls into the six destinies, entering the realm of dreams and illusions. As the ancients said, the root of life and death is but a single thought—creation itself is dreamlike, the very root of life and death.\n\nTherefore, the great cultivator has no dreams. By day, they are free and untrammeled; by night, they are likewise free and untrammeled. Spirit guards qi, and qi embraces spirit, merging into a single whole, transcending beyond yin and yang—what dreams could there be? If the learner of the Dao can recognize that dreams are but dreams and master them, they stand beyond life and death, unobscured by yin and yang. Let the learner ponder this.\n\n**On Nature**\nNature is the primordial, singular spark of utmost numinosity within the human body—this is the original spirit. This numinosity existed before parents gave birth, never increasing; it remains after birth, never diminishing. It is inherently complete, neither lacking nor in excess.\n\nThus, when a person is born, their nature is never not good, though their qi and material endowment differ, each receiving its own distinct allotment. Hence, there is the original nature and the nature of qi and material endowment. The original nature is awareness and movement; the nature of qi and material endowment is greed, wrath, delusion, and attachment.\n\nTherefore, those of superior wisdom awaken to their original nature, unentangled by even a thread, all dharmas luminously clear. Those of middling wisdom are half-enlightened, half-deluded: when they grasp it, it remains; when they let go, it vanishes. Those of lesser wisdom have no hold on their spirit, their thoughts giving rise to emotions, clinging to their affairs.\n\nObserving these three, we see that nature has gradations. Some may ask: The Buddha said that all sentient beings possess Buddha-nature—why then are human natures graded? Ah! Even the father and child of tigers and wolves, the ruler and subjects of bees and ants, are not without Buddha-nature—it is their forms that differ. The nature of humans and the myriad things is the same; the forms of humans and the myriad things differ.\n\nNature is like the moon in the sky; form is like water upon the earth. When the myriad waters are clear, the single moon shines universally; when the myriad waters are turbid, the single moon is universally dim. It is not that the moon is bright or dim—it is that the waters are clear or muddy. Those who become sages, wise ones, or worthies receive the clear qi; those who become fools, dullards, or evildoers receive the turbid qi. Thus, the Buddha said: *A thousand rivers hold a thousand moons; ten thousand miles without clouds, ten thousand miles of sky.* Such is the truth.\n\nThis single spark of luminous clarity is formless and without appearance, timeless and without age, piercing stone and penetrating metal—there is fundamentally nothing to be said of it. If one can penetrate and see through this point, unshaken by any realm, inwardly observing the heart in unbroken continuity, forging it into a single whole, standing alone in the void—then one naturally has the adamantine gate of protection, all demons disperse, and one may speak as an equal with the ancient Buddhas.\n\nIf the learner of the Dao does not understand the work of inwardly guarding stillness within the true nature, even if they can recite the entire canon, wielding eloquent speech, in the end they will only waste their essence and spirit, to no benefit. All conditioned dharmas, having attainment, also have failure—seeking the true by clinging to forms? All is delusion. If one merely practices the unconditioned dharma, eating when hungry, drinking when thirsty, one may yet fall into dead emptiness.\n\nThis single circle ○ rolls like a pearl upon a plate, perfectly round and following the earth, vibrantly alive—it is not being, nor is it non-being, nor is it attached to any single thing. How does the assembly comprehend this?\n\nAh! *After the rain, the river is empty, the mountain colors still; a single crow’s cry in the bright moonlight.*\n\n**Song**\nNine Songs of the Whirling Wind Mingled as One",
      "overlap_context": "f cultivating the true. Its essential nature lies in reduction: diminishing the external to augment the internal. When the internal is settled, qi harmonizes; when qi harmonizes, spirit harmonizes; when spirit harmonizes, the Dao becomes serene.\n\nAt this stage, one transcends yin and yang, emerges from life and death, and moves freely without entanglement, ascending Peng Isle, roaming the Grotto-Heavens, transforming at will—how profoundly mysterious! Such talk—is it not like speaking of dreams?",

      "translated_text": "The Primordial envelops the Great Ultimate, named the Central Yang,\nA single speck of radiance—priceless in the world.\nNeither behind nor ahead,\nVast as a millet grain, suspended in empty space.\nIt transforms and births the myriad heavens, forests of phenomena,\nThe Dipper’s pivot revolves ceaselessly through day and night.\nNeither below nor above,\nFive *zhang* from the earth, the golden crow takes flight.\nFrom its beak emerges a crimson wheel,\nIlluminating Samantabhadra astride the white elephant.\nThe Gate of Heaven closes, the Door of Earth opens,\nA single *qi* circulates—this is the subtle sign.\nDragons chant, clouds rise, ocean waves surge,\nTigers roar, winds stir, sunlight wanes into dusk.\nAt this moment, the two essences return as one,\nClouds disperse, winds cease, emptiness turns azure.\nThe Human Gate is sealed, the Ghost Portal blocked,\nA drop of golden essence is thus attained.\nIn the refining furnace, flames are stoked to forge a sword,\nIts edge sharp as ice, its brilliance dazzling.\nIn wild battles, it wards off peril and pacifies the land,\nSevering the Three Corpses and the Six Bandits.\nThe Three Corpses perish, the Six Bandits vanish,\nMerged into a single mass, becoming adamantine.\nTranscending the mortal to enter the sacred, emerging from the kalpa,\nNo longer dwelling in the underworld but ascending to heaven.\nAt this time, truly joyous,\nIn the scorching sixth month, white snow flies.\nSated with the finest ambrosia at the celestial feast,\nJade nectar flows ceaselessly from the mouth.\nBlood transmutes to white, bones to jade,\nThe whole body refined to the lightness of a feather.\nThe numinous embryo nurtured for ten full months,\nA breakthrough at the crown—radiance is born.\nNeither born nor dead,\nAcross kalpas to this day, nameless.\nOne spirit transforms into ten thousand spirits,\nYet it is none other than the Master of Central Yang.\n\n**Song of Realization**\nThe Master of Realization studied Zhuangzi and Laozi,\nSwiftly awakening to the true mechanism, turning back early.\nHaving received but half a phrase from the immortal teacher,\nIron walls and silver mountains were all toppled.\nThe ancestral nature, luminous and perfect, is the root,\nNeither form nor void.\nPiercing gold and stone, emerging from the kalpa,\nStill and unmoving, yet responsive when moved.\nThus, in refining the elixir, employ the Mysterious Female,\nTempering mercury and smelting lead to secure the furnace and cauldron.\nWithin the twelve double-hours, inwardly observe in stillness,\nEmbracing the myriad phenomena, dwelling in the immortal realm.\nWhen yang arises, swiftly gather it,\nRevolving the wind in fusion, wielding the numinous banner.\nThe Yellow Lad of the sea’s depths embraces the sun as it rises,\nThe Azure Dragon leaps backward to the Southern *Li*.\nThe White Tiger is led down from the Golden Gate,\nFeathered canopies and radiant essence flow unceasing.\nStraight through the Tower of Nine Stories to the Crimson Palace,\nA perfect pearl is born, like the bright moon.\nThe ten directions’ vast phenomena return to celestial might,\nFilling the cave and flooding the void with flying white snow.\nGhosts wail, spirits grieve, all traces vanish,\nHeaven and earth become a realm of glass.\nAt this moment, truly joyous,\nThis is the secret of the Returned Elixir.\nThe mute tasting honey knows it for himself,\nLucidly, neither birth nor extinction.\nThe infant nurtured for ten months,\nA breakthrough at the crown—heavenly immortals descend.\nThree thousand deeds perfected, eight hundred merits complete,\nRiding the phoenix, ascending in broad daylight to Penglai.\n\n**Song of the Returned Elixir**\nA stranger bestowed upon me the secret of the Returned Elixir,\nThe ninefold cyclical elixir holds profound meaning.\nThe Mysterious Pass—a single aperture, the root of heaven and earth,\nForcibly named the Elixir Furnace, called the Reclining Moon.\nNeither biased nor partial, precisely centered,\nThe Eight Trigrams and Five Phases encircle and array.\nThe immortals point to this as the foundation of the elixir,\nOnly requiring the primordial spirit to return to the *qi*-cavern.\nSpirit and *qi* merge, anchoring the elixir field,\nLuminous and void, illuminating the profound and clear.\nThe four great elements of the body belong to yin,\nYin’s turbidity seizes yang, and yang is not pure.\nDescending from root to branch, form is born,\nThus human life bears loss and deficiency.\nKnow this, cultivate, and attain longevity,\nNot knowing it, cultivation follows form to extinction.\nNow I teach you the *Song of the Returned Elixir*,\nWithin its verses, the celestial mechanism is fully revealed.\nThe opening and closing of heaven and earth is the gate of the *Yi*,\nThe sun and moon’s cyclic return—its mechanism never ceases.\nObserve the Way of Heaven, grasp the movement of Heaven,\nYou must recognize the winter solstice within the body.\nAt the winter solstice, yang arises—swiftly gather the lead,\nFirmly guard the Three Passes, be resolute and fierce.\nSummon the warhorses to return to the stable,\nLock the macaque in chains, allow no laxity.\nIn the *Li* Palace, the wind of the sacred flute stirs,\nBlowing down flames to scorch the sea with heat.\nIn an instant, the hidden dragon appears in the field,\nThunder crashes, the dragon soars, golden lightning flashes.\nThe Yellow River’s waves surge through the Gate of Heaven,\nTransforming into sweet rain to wash away demonic filth.\nThe Metal Lord rides the tiger down the western mountain,\nSeizing the dragon pearl, his heart alone rejoices.\nReturn it to the earthen crucible, seal it firmly,\nOne battle’s success—no need to cling to clumsiness.\nThe sky, free of floating haze, *qi* clear and bright,\nNaturally, the elixir congeals within the crucible.\nIn the cave, spring warms, the yellow sprout grows,\nOn the cliff, emptiness clears, white snow flies.\nThe sacred embryo nurtured for ten months,\nDivine water and the flower pool flow unceasing.\nWithin this subtle principle lies profound mystery,\nSoft as silk, hard as iron.\nMortal bones refined into cold jade,\nRed blood tempered into white.\nShedding the womb, changing the crucible, emerging from the yin tally,\nShattering the void, the scene of radiance transforms.\nThe yang spirit’s transformations—vast and luminous,\nAlone stepping upon rosy clouds to the Golden Gate.\n\n**Five Hymns of Pacing the Void**\n\n**I**\nThe One True Master of Dwelling in Mystery,\nDaily pays homage to Kunlun.\nCloud encampments chant jade melodies,\nThe Dragon Han soars with golden tribute.\nDharma rain sprinkles the azure vault,\nHeavenly flowers scatter in profusion.\nDivine beings listen in solemn stillness,\nWithin stands the Lord of Longevity.\n\n**II**\nThe One True Master of Dwelling in Mystery,\nBows in reverence to the Void Sovereign.\nPlaying the flute to summon the nine phoenixes,\nDriving a chariot drawn by six dragons.\nThe Jade Capital gathers divine multitudes,\nThe Golden Chamber radiates rosy light.\nThe Perfected of Illumination emerges from the empyrean,\nStepping serenely into the immortal hall.\n\n**III**\nThe One True Master of Dwelling in Mystery,\nBows in reverence to the Three Purities.\nThe Blue Maiden holds the jade scepter,\nThe Yellow Lad bears the numinous banner.\nAscending the Twelve-Story Tower,\nSun and moon exchange radiant brilliance.\nA single grain of divine elixir is bestowed,\nConsuming it, longevity extends.\n\n**IV**\nThe One True Master of Dwelling in Mystery,\nCultivates the Dao and attains long years.\nThe Three Flowers bind the true stem,\nThe Four Virtues ceaselessly revolve.\nThe Phoenix Mother conceives numinous splendor,\nThe Dragon Net merges with the Great Mystery.\nJade nectar irrigates the five viscera,\nFulfilling the path, ascending to the cloudy heavens.\n\n**V**\nThe One True Master of Carefree Wandering,\nTruly a body drifting beyond the clouds.\nThe Three Heavens initiate numinous movement,\nThe Eight Poles revolve the stars.\nThe Mysterious Valley resounds with jade pendants,\nThe Jasper Pool feasts in lingering spring.",

years.\n\n**One**\nIn motion, stillness, sitting, lying—never stray from the center,\nWhen the time comes, spirit knows, intent flows free.\nQi circulates in ceaseless cycles of *sheng* and *gou*,\nThe Five Phases gather in *zhun* and *meng*.\nThe Azure Dragon leaps backward into the Mysterious Valley,\nThe White Tiger is drawn forth into the Crimson Palace.\nIn an instant, Heaven and Earth unite in embrace,\nThe Returned Elixir refines, filling the furnace with crimson glow.\n\n**Two**\nThe Great Dao of Primordial Heaven is fundamentally non-doing,\nYet when *tiankui* arises, one must recognize the moment.\nThe Five Qi merge—first seal *xun*,\nA single yang is drawn forth, then fills *li*.\nVast as falling snow, dissolving kalpas of dust,\nThe elixir in the crucible congeals, jade branches bloom.\nFrom this point on, only gentle fire is needed,\nEmpty the heart and hold the Infant daylong.\n\n**Three**\nThe Celestial Stem turns, the Dipper shifts,\nGathering golden essence into the Field of Destiny.\nThe *xun* gate’s winds return, opening the sacred key,\nThe *kun* furnace’s fire blazes, refining silver lead.\nThe homeland’s spring permeates, the Three Flowers flourish,\nThe world’s mists disperse, the moon waxes full.\nSilent, wordless, ever embracing simplicity,\nThe Great Sound, boundless, enfolds all mystery.\n\n**Four**\nA human life of a hundred years is but a floating bubble,\nDo not wait for time to hasten white hairs.\nEarth, water, fire, wind—this body is a temporary convergence,\nSpirit, essence, soul, and intent must be cultivated.\nSeeking Dao through meditation or inquiry—no need for many words,\nErecting the crucible, installing the furnace—do not seek recklessly.\nGrasp these subtle signs,\nAnd you will find Penglai here and now.\n\n**Five**\nOpening and closing, Heaven and Earth divide a single qi,\nBalanced before and after the crescent’s arc.\nTo refine form, harmonize it with golden liquid,\nTo subdue the *po*, first quicken the living mercury.\nThe maiden weds Wood Lord, their love is true,\nThe child clings to Heavenly Mother, their bond deep.\nConcentrate spirit, still breath, ever observe the wondrous,\nWithin the gourd, a separate spring unfolds.\n\n**Six**\nNine returns, seven reversals refine cinnabar,\nEight flavors blend into one sublime taste.\nIn the mercury furnace, spring deepens, jade leaves sprout,\nIn the lead crucible, fire subdues, golden flowers bloom.\nDrunk on ghee in the Hall of Eternal Spring,\nThe moon of wisdom shines beyond kalpas’ abode.\nThough Heaven and Earth may perish, my Dao endures,\nOn Kunlun’s heights, I recline amidst mist and clouds.\n\n**Seven**\nThe Jade Clarity’s Primordial Beginning gathers the host of immortals,\nTen thousand sages descend upon the millet-grain heaven.\nDragon and Tiger soar high, following the Dipper’s turn,\nPhoenix and simurgh dance low, chasing the wind’s whirl.\nIn an instant, the celebration unfolds in the Primordial Palace,\nA single spark of light surpasses the Emperor of Images.\nOverjoyed beyond words, the heart delights,\nSnow flies in fire across the field of mushrooms.\n\n**Eight**\nWithin this body lies its own Heaven and Earth,\nA single slice divides, yet remains whole.\nThe Yellow River, ten thousand miles, flows through the earth’s axis,\nThe Four Seasons’ pure qi connects to the sky’s root.\nDragon’s roar and Tiger’s howl unite in true passion,\nGhosts wail and spirits shriek as flames rage.\nPiercing the void, nothing clings,\nWho can speak of the secrets within?\n\n**Nine**\nThe barbarian boy rides the iron ox backward,\nHis hands ever play the jade flute.\nA single aperture awakens the dream of life and death,\nSix notes shatter ancient and modern doubts.\nOn Kunlun’s slopes, spring warms, yellow sprouts grow,\nAt the *xun* gate, winds soften, white snow hangs.\nWho can fathom this song, this melody?\nOnly Heaven knows the heart’s truth.\n\n**Ten**\nWind sweeps away the last clouds, the jade firmament clears,\nMoon bright, autumn waters—great elixir congeals.\nResponding to circumstances without attachment,\nPenetrating earth, piercing heaven—this is the supreme vehicle.\nThe Dao pervades the Three Powers, only the Old Master knows,\nThe lamp is passed through six generations, Lu possesses the skill.\nA nod of understanding grasps the principle of firmness,\nWhat need for many words on Ge and Teng?\n\n**Eleven**\nWithin the body, the winter solstice stirs flying ashes,\nAt sea, spring follows the Dipper’s handle’s return.\nA single breath circles the heavens, dividing *zi* and *wu*,\nFire rises at the Three Passes, shaking wind and thunder.\nIn the Jade Field, mushrooms sprout in misty beauty,\nIn the Golden Valley, peaches of immortality bloom with dew.\nEver drunk on ghee, ever inebriated,\nRosy light pierces straight through the crown.\n\n**Twelve**\nThe Spirit Abyss is still, merging with profound darkness,\nThe Golden Mother’s flying wheel emerges from the jade gate.\nStraight to the *li* palace to seek the Radiant Maiden,\nReturning to the *kun* chamber, relying on Heavenly Soldiers.\nIn an instant, a millet grain forms the mysterious image,\nTen thousand miles of rivers and lakes enter the pure vase.\nIf you ask the true meaning within,\nWhite clouds seal the verdant peaks in silence.\n\n**Thirteen**\nOne gives rise to two, two to three,\nAll phenomena return to a single grain.\nIn stillness, observe without self,\nWithin, only the empty hermitage is seen.\nNeither near nor far, neither high nor low,\nNeither west nor east, neither north nor south.\nWhen the season arrives, the melon ripens of itself,\nWind clear, moon bright—Xiangtan is full.\n\n**Fourteen**\nLower the screen, seal the gates, guard the true interval,\nFill the belly, empty the heart, refine the Great Return.",

valley revives in spring, wine flushes the face.\nJoyous, carefree, worldly worries forgotten,\nEver has the benevolent one loved dwelling by the mountains.\n\n**Sixteen**\nA speck of primordial creative essence,\nBorn first from the original qi.\nFive phases, four images—all issue from this,\nEight trigrams, three powers—together they merge.\nThe wise refine it, and a golden Buddha appears,\nThe deluded lose it, and their jade mountain collapses.\nWho knows that false actions end in illusion?\nIn the end, turning back is the Great Clarity.\n\n**Seventeen**\nThe Gate of Heaven opens and closes, west and east,\nSpirit and qi generate each other, transforming blockage into passage.\nThe Mysterious Maiden plays her flute to summon the colored phoenix,\nThe Yellow Lad embraces the sun, riding the Azure Dragon.\nThree flowers flourish, clustering in the golden crucible,\nMyriad forms array themselves, gleaming in the azure void.\nWithout stepping beyond the courtyard, one knows the great transformation—\nHeaven and Earth all belong to the master within.\n\n**Eighteen**\nTo gather lead, one must gather true lead;\nIf one gathers common lead, it is but partial.\nFacing circumstances to set up the furnace is all false,\nSwallowing mist and ingesting qi is also in vain.\nTiger and dragon are subdued only by nature,\nRaven and hare are captured without force.\nIf you can fathom this deeply,\nThen you may truly learn to be an immortal.\n\n**Nineteen**\nVast and indistinct, the Dao is all-pervading,\nHow could the reckless words of ordinary men fathom it?\nBefore the Supreme Ultimate divided, there was no *jiazi*,\nYet the infant’s first cry already held heaven and earth.\nThe fire dragon chases south as the mud ox flees,\nThe metal tiger follows west as the iron horse gallops.\nGrasp the mechanism of inversion and reversal,\nAnd what fear remains of not transcending the root of life and death?\n\n**Twenty**\nEach time yang arises to gather the

in obscurity, even ghosts and spirits revere.\n\n**Twenty-Two**\nThe lesser hermit hides in mountains, the greater in the world,\nWherever one goes, joy is found in nature.\nThe great sound resides within the soundless,\nThe wondrous form ever precedes the formed.\nIn stillness, the millet-pearl conceals the cosmos,\nIn motion, thunder and lightning shake mountains and rivers.\nFrom this, ghosts

      "translated_text": "**Second**\nHold fast to the One, and the Dao spontaneously arises,\nYou must await the bright noon to strike the third watch.\nThunder shakes the great earth, the divine mechanism stirs,\nStars wheel through the celestial sphere, the Dipper’s handle lies horizontal.\nThe golden crucible flames, yin miasmas vanish,\nThe lead furnace congeals cinnabar, mercury blossoms gleam.\nThough the void be shattered, nothing is truly attained—\nYet heaven’s immortals record your name.\n\n**Third**\nTo learn immortality, first recognize true emptiness,\nDual cultivation of nature and life is the fundamental teaching.\nWith each breath refine yin to capture the fierce tiger,\nAs the Three Yangs usher in spring, mount the flying dragon.\nThe jade crucible’s fire ignites, golden waves seethe,\nThe Celestial Valley’s spring flows, earth’s veins open.\nWhen the ten-month embryo matures, spirit transforms of itself,\nRoaming the clouds’ edge, the Dao knows no bounds.\n\n**Fourth**\nThe man who truly conceives the embryo\nCan bear a child in a single year.\nEach one emerges riding a white crane,\nEach dawn returns to recline in the Spirit Terrace.\nEver attended by Earth Mother’s sustaining power,\nHeaven’s kitchen sends offerings unbidden.\nNot that my school inverts the natural order—\nThe Gate of Nature opens atop the crown.\n\n**Fifth**\nMy school’s supreme Dao is fundamentally non-doing,\nIn the white-snow pot, Kan and Li are paired.\nOften I drink three cups of the wine of idleness,\nNow and then I play a few moves of the game of no contest.\nVeiling my light, I silently preserve the true body,\nRegulating breath, I continuously restore the foundation of life.\nMastering these two wondrous applications,\nAt last you ascend the ladder to heaven.\n\n**Sixth**\nThe immortals’ oral instructions are few in words,\nA single phrase from the vast immortal canon suffices.\nThe Primal Beginning suspends the pearl to enact great transformation,\nVajra pushes the Dipper to revolve the celestial sphere.\nFirst, the swift steed gallops to open the Yellow Path,\nNext, the Flowery Pond is rinsed to moisten the Crimson Field.\nWhen the Xun-gate’s wind rises, the golden tiger roars,\nThe whole body’s myriad qi together attain immortality.\n\n**Seventh**\nSeal the upper pass, open the lower pass,\nRevealing the eastern pool’s rosy dawn.\nGradually the steam rises, scorching the Water Palace,\nSlowly it ascends to the upper Li Palace.\nGather the great medicine where the Three Flowers converge,\nProduce the round pearl, each moment a contribution.\nThis is the true oral instruction for returning cinnabar—\nForm and spirit both perfected, you witness the immortal school.\n\n**Oral Instructions for Xu Daosheng**\nThe supreme Dao of returning cinnabar is fundamentally wordless,\nIts wonder lies in moving post-heavenly after pre-heavenly.\nWhen the two qi merge, first rectify nature,\nAt the stirring of the one Yang, swiftly withdraw lead.\nIn Qian’s domain, the medicine is sown as numinous mist gathers,\nThe golden crucible’s returning wind kindles the fire.\nFrom this, great peace is established under heaven,\nOn the Terrace of Luxuriant Clouds, you play with the moon’s beauty.\n\n**Oral Instructions for Long Zhengzhong**\nThe empty valley’s sound transmits the midnight bell,\nThe golden crow flies forth as sea and sky redden.\nKan and Li unite, relying on Kun’s earth,\nLead and mercury are refined, borrowing Xun’s wind.\nWhen the jade pistil blooms, empty snow falls,\nWhere the jade nectar flows, earth’s springs open.\nReturning to the origin, reverting to the root, form and spirit are wondrous,\nDragon virtue completes Qian, the moon stands at full.\n\n**Inner Landscape Cinnabar Instructions for Chen Yuqi**\nThe pre-heavenly great Dao is fundamentally non-doing,\nTo restore life, you must activate the mechanism of transformation.\nThe Jade Maiden embraces the toad and ascends to heaven,\nThe Golden Lord rides the tiger and returns in the moon.\nLead dissolves, mercury yields, cinnabar congeals,\nThe crucible transforms, the furnace empties, white snow flies.\nUnceasingly reflect inward with unbroken effort,\nNaturally, within the body, you behold radiance.\n\n**For Cai Liaokong**\nAwakening to true emptiness is the fundamental teaching,\nThe message of true emptiness is fundamentally not empty.\nThe dragon returns to the great sea, clouds first gather,\nThe □ howls on the cold crag, the moon stands at full.\nThe wisdom eye clearly perceives the formless realm,\nThe Dharma-body eternally abides in Potala Palace.\nThus perceiving the primordial self,\nA single point of light endures through ancient ages.\n\n**Seeing Daoist Zou Qiuyun Off to Reside on Turtle Mountain**\nIn yellow cap and rustic robes, his countenance like a youth’s,\nHe returns to dwell on Turtle Mountain’s foremost peak.\nDrunk, he blows his iron flute beneath the forest moon,\nHis jade book summons the dragon from the cave.\nReigniting the golden crucible’s fire to refine cinnabar,\nHe plants pines by the stone stream to call back the cranes.\nThough parted, our bodies may be a thousand leagues apart,\nOur hearts should meet as yours.\n\n**For Yiyangzi**\nWithin the mysterious pass’s aperture, the Dao contains truth,\nApplying the celestial mechanism lies in a single ascent.\nThe moon shines on the mountain peak, the golden tiger roars,\nThunder shakes the sea’s depths, the fire dragon ascends.\nThe three great medicines are withdrawn and replenished,\nThe nine-fold numinous cinnabar wondrously coalesces.\nWhen practice is complete and merit full, spirit transforms of itself,\nOn the Jade Clarity Heaven, you watch it soar.\n\n**Oral Instructions for Advancing the Dao to Xiao Yanjing**\nSpirit returns to the qi-cavern, settling at the center,\nFlying fire scorches the sky, boiling the sea’s gold.\nSouth and north, the two celestial bodies divide above and below,\nEast and west, a single intent determines floating and sinking.\nHare and crow bathe, preserving true vision,\nDragon and tiger rage, employing death to capture.\nIn a moment of fusion, cinnabar congeals of itself,\nA breeze in fair weather, a moon after rain fill the jade forest.\n\n**For Quanzhen Daoist Li Siddao**\nGreat and small, dark passions reside in one body,\nOn the Jasper Terrace, the Primal Beginning hangs the sun-pearl.\nThe Kun crucible revolves, the flying Golden Mother,\nBrahma-qi swirls, structuring the jade book.\nThe moon shines on sea and sky, autumn waters vast,\nClouds withdraw from the stone chamber, intent is thus.\nThe immortal capital has long known your name,\nPhoenix and crane come to welcome you to walk the Great Void.\n\n**Letter to Gong Wuzhen on Advancing Daoist Practice**\nTo understand the human heart is to understand the Dao-heart,\nThe Dao-heart must be sought within the wondrous.\nAdd medicine to the Qian crucible, lead dissolves mercury,\nRefine with fire in the Kun furnace, stone transforms to gold.\nEight poles’ winds clear, the cliff tiger roars,\nA thousand rivers’ moons brighten, the sea dragon sings.\nWhen the jade zither’s *Equalizing Heaven* is played to its end,\nIt scatters as the *Yang Spring*’s sound beyond things.\n\n**Inner Pointers on Talisman-Fire for Huang Shouzhong**\nThe Primal Beginning’s bright pearl hangs five fathoms high,\nThe Jade Perfected leads the assembly to meet mid-heaven.\nThe three chariots move, thunder shakes Kan,\nA single qi circulates, nature reverts to Qian.\nThe golden crucible wondrously congeals, cinnabar and mercury unite,\nThe spirit furnace silently stills, tiger and dragon sleep.\nThus unmoving, the true message,\nGreat wisdom perfectly pervades, preceding the Lord of Images.\n\n**For Lanranzi**\nThe lazy old man reclines on the White Cloud Terrace,\nWhen one aperture opens, ten thousand apertures open.\nEight-cornered rays of light float like jade script,\nThe Three Flowers gather in the crucible, congealing the golden embryo.",

Heaven.\nOriginally not following the turning of empty space,\nWhy seek floating fame to stain illusory bonds?\n\n**II**\nThe Valley Spirit does not die, the Dao is at ease;\nResponding to change without fixed method, the body is naturally mysterious.\nThe divine eye clearly observes beyond kalpas of dust,\nThe Dipper’s handle ever stands before the Northern Asterism.\nGolden flowers bloom, kindled by the fire of the Three Fields;\nJade script’s radiance floats in the five-fathom heaven.\nThe myriad dharmas originally have no fixed thought—\nBlending light with the world, simply follow conditions.\n\n**III**\nThose who delight in the Dao are naturally at ease,\nWith a single breath of dark emotion, merging into the profound.\nThe numinous real returns its chariot within emptiness,\nMaidens of radiance hold flowers, scattering them before the seat.\nThe sword’s sweep emits light, piercing the Northern Dipper;\nThe flute’s notes, though without holes, resound in the Celestial Harmony.\nWhen merit is complete and fame achieved, one should withdraw—\nAll things accord with others, following worldly conditions.\n\n**IV**\nThe prince seeking immortality, his nature bright and clear,\nIn the numinous terrace’s silence, awakens to the profound mystery.\nYang is drawn from Kan to fill within Li;\nThe Crow Mother flies and alights before the grotto.\nThe elixir

forge a bond with the Dao.\n\n**V**\nThe Old Lord discoursed on Dao and virtue, luminously clear;\nThe ninety-nine numinous verses, each character profound.\nThe ancestral qi transformed and gave birth after the Primal Beginning;\nThe divine mechanism wondrously appeared before the Grand Purity.\nLong he dwelt beneath the pillar as the Zhou’s historian,\nFar he crossed the Pamirs to imprint the Buddha’s heaven.\nIf one can penetrate this,\nWhy need one be mired in worldly bonds?\n\n**VI**\nThe Tathāgata’s countenance is originally majestic—\nIt is not by seeking mystery elsewhere that one finds mystery.\nA single point of empty numinosity transcends beyond things;\nA thousand heads of wondrous awakening stand before the moment.\nIce melts and reverts to water as before;\nThe moon sets, yet clearly does not leave the sky.\nI send this word to later students of the path:\nStrive to form good bonds in the Dharma assembly.\n\n**VII**\nThe Master’s writings alone shine brilliantly,\nIn the *Doctrine of the Mean* and *Great Learning*, revealing subtle mysteries.\nAll governance emerges from the *River Chart*;\nThe *Heart Yi* ever abides before the hexagrams.\nAnxious for the Dao, he often pondered matters after his death;\nAbiding in benevolence, he never left the heaven of nature.\nWhen Old Cong saw him, he sighed like a dragon,\nInquiring about rites, he still sought the path beyond.\n\n**VIII**\nWandering beyond things, his interest carefree,\nThree returns of the *Yinfu* refine the plain mystery.\nTreading the Dipper, he often ascends the Golden Gate;\nSoaring in spirit, he ever pays homage before the Jade Emperor.\nA stream swells with snow, spring returns to the valley;\nA myriad miles of clouds part, the moon fills the sky.\nWho can grasp this wonder, this feeling?\nOnly the Yellow Dame understands the bond within.\n\n**IX**\nThe immortal’s Dao of purity and emptiness is no accident—\nOne must awaken to the real from the heart.\nAll radiance lies within dark emotion;\nHow can ghosts and demons know the nature of awareness?\nIn the third winter of the Northern Sea, thunder shakes the earth;\nIn the sixth month of the Southern Palace, snow blankets the sky.\nWherever the idle body wanders is the road to Yingzhou—\nSpiritual transformation is boundless, responding to myriad conditions.\n\n**X**\nSitting motionless all day, inwardly merged,\nThe river chariot moves, precisely in the central mystery.\nTwo streams of pure qi surge upward to heaven;\nA thousand-foot flying spring cascades before the ravine.\nManifestation does not follow other realms;\nAttaining the real lies only within one’s own heaven.\nWorldly people point and call it a vain affair,\nLaughing at my wind-madness in learning the bond of stillness.\n\n**For Wu Deying, by Zhi’an**\nWashing his ears among the clouds, delighting in the sound of springs,\nAn empty mind does not follow the shifting of illusory emotions.\nThe medicine furnace’s elixir is ripe, yet fire is still kept;\nA grain of millet hangs in emptiness, revealing another heaven.\nThe marks of ten thousand waters recede as the wind subsides;\nThe shadows of a thousand peaks fall as the moon becomes full.\nWith a single gourd and a single bamboo hat, delighting in the moment—\nWhy seek immortality in Penglai?\n\n**For Daoist Guo of Wudang Palace, by Fuyuan**\nOnce in Yecheng he met the immortal who planted peaches,\nAlone receiving the esoteric transmission of the *Yellow Court*.\nEating wood, he sought no matters beyond the body;\nIn the medicine furnace, he ever refined the lead within fire.\nThe Three Fields warm in spring, jade-like clouds arise;\nA myriad waters gleam cold, the moon rests in the sky.\nAll is understood, all is

mani pearl is nurtured forth.\n\n**XV**\nWithin Kan, one stroke is true lead;\nDrawn forth to mend Li’s palace, remaking Qian.\nThe talismanic fire returns to Kun’s crucible,\nThe numinous script gleams with fresh crimson radiance.\n\n**XVI**\nWithin the gourd, Kan and Li are ever paired,\nOne’s own landscape is known to oneself alone.\nAs the waning year meets the new spring’s arrival,\nOnce more the original Jiazi is reckoned.\n\n**XVII**\nEmpty the heart, still the will, silently lower the screen,\nNot a single thread of emptiness is permitted.\nWhen the myriad things arise, observe their return and transformation,\nThe Five Phases invert and revolve in ebb and flow.\n\n**XVIII**\nTo refine the adamantine, indestructible body,\nThree kinds of medicinal substances must be wholly true.\nIn one furnace, water and fire refine and boil them,\nThen one becomes a person atop Penglai’s peak.\n\n**XIX**\nAt the stirring of the first yang, gather true lead,\nTurn the celestial mechanism—the Dipper spins of itself.\nThrice advance, thrice retreat, with vigorous force,\nThe whole body ignites in flames that scorch the sky.\n\n**XX**\nThe Herdboy drives ten thousand miles across the Dark Gully,\nThe path is thick with yellow blossoms and purple mist.\nThe Weaver Girl invites him to cross the river,\nWithin the gourd lies yet another storied pavilion.\n\n**XXI**\nThe

bloom.\n\n**XXII**\nOf the union of Li and Kan, to whom may it be told?\nOne’s own message is known to oneself alone.\nHaving wandered the ends of the earth without other affairs,\nOne returns to the divine mountain to cultivate purple lingzhi.\n\n**XXIII**\nOver the sea, one has already ridden the yellow crane away,\nFrom the moon, the rabbit is seized and brought forth.\nThe celestial wind blows me back to Peng Island,\nTen thousand golden lotuses bloom in a single night.\n\n**XXIV**\nThe Mysterious Pass’s aperture is originally formless,\nYet birth as buddha or immortal is but a forced name.\nWith intent settled and unchanging, practice the two eights,\nThe great sound of boundless measure is the rare tone.\n\n**XXV**\nThere is a thing formed before heaven and earth,\nLofty and independent, transcending all.\nThe Crimson Chart unfurls, illuminating the Three Luminaries,\nIn the Dragon Han’s spring, the Jiazi year returns.\n\n**XXVI**\nAt midnight, the Wooden Lad roams the eastern sea,\nA wheel of fire rises, riding the dragon in reverse.\nAfter paying court to the Southern Emperor,\nOne sits and watches celestial blossoms, no Xun wind stirring.\n\n**XXVII**\nBehind

dawn.\n\n**XXVIII**\nThe Metal Lord rides a qilin from the ocean’s depths,\nMounting Kunlun, treading upon purple clouds.\nBy the Vermilion Sparrow Bridge, he meets the Alchemical Maiden,\nReturning together to pay homage to the Peaceful Lord.\n\n**XXIX**\nAt the first crow of the golden rooster, when Gui is born,\nThe Dipper turns, the Silver River shifts in order.\nFrom the Yin position it begins, to the Shen position it ends,\nThe returning wind blends all, forming the foundation of the elixir.\n\n**XXX**\nWholly essence, wholly qi, and wholly spirit,\nThis is the indestructible body

Corpses and Six Thieves’ souls are annihilated.\n\n**XXXIV**\nThe Golden Elixir’s great medicine is not hard to know,\nSpirit descends to fumigate, qi ascends to shift.\nMost wondrous is this singular marvel—\nThe mountain-burning talisman seizes the celestial mechanism.\n\n**XXXV**\nAn extraordinary person imparts to me the returning elixir’s secret,\nReturning to Dan Mountain to test and refine it.\nIn a single breath, dragon and tiger contend,\nThunder and lightning shake the celestial gates of the nine skies.\n\n**XXXVI**\nTo cultivate the truth, first refine body and mind,\nA segment of celestial mechanism, profound in wondrous principle.\nTurn these hinges of the pass,\nYellow mud and black stone transform into gold.\n\n**XXXVII**\nUpon the mountain’s rise, gather the medicinal sprouts,\nFire concealed in earth, burning within water.\nIn ebb and flow, take care to guard,\nAs if crossing a single-log bridge over a precipice.\n\n**XXXVIII**\nIn learning immortality, do not pursue empty nothingness,\nTrue mercury and true lead are the original lineage.\nWu earth flows forth, Ji earth receives,\nRefined into a mass of purple-golden red.\n\n**XXXIX**\nDisciples all recite the oral chan,\nYet when asked of true chan, they fall silent.\nHow could they know my true creation?\nThe sun rises in the east and sets in the west.\n\n**XL**\nThe furnace bellows fan the wind, fire

work.\n\n**XLI**\nMy great Dao is originally without marvel,\nBefore the bamboo-striking cliff, the black turtle is summoned.\nFire compels metal to move, inverting and turning,\nA single tiger’s roar, snowflakes fly.\n\n**XLII**\nTo gather lead, one must align with the celestial mechanism,\nAttend carefully to essence’s ascent, step by step.\nWu and Ji return to the origin, Geng and Jia unite,\nThe Metal Lord embraces the Jade Toad and returns.\n\n**XLIII**\nRefine essence into qi, qi into spirit,\nSpirit and qi harmonize as child and mother.\nThe more it is refined, the firmer the elixir ripens,\nEach time it is raised, it is renewed.\n\n**XLIV**\nThe Magpie Bridge’s reflection in the crimson sunset,\nThe Three Passes along the spine open a single path.\nMastering the two true wondrous uses,\nExternally gathering medicine, internally achieving fusion.\n\n**XLV**\nExternal medicine employs great transformation,\nThe internal elixir’s nurturing requires no action.\nWhen the time comes, a silent return conveys the message,\nThe footless lad inverts and ascends the ladder.\n\n**XLVI**\nThere are those deluded who falsely transmit,\nSealing essence, lewd women, and drawing lead.\nIf this is called the elixir’s medicine,\nIt would make the immortals of the Great Brahma Heaven laugh.\n\n**XLVII**\nThe Dao does not depart from the heart—Gui is lead,\nTo gather lead, first

      "translated_text": "**LIX**\nThe divine water of the Flowery Pond is poured in ceaseless streams,\nCultivating golden blossoms that birth purple clouds.\n\n**LX**\nWithout a master’s transmission, do not sit in meditation—\nEven a heart turned to ash or wood withers in vain.\nWho knows the secret of talismanic fire and the returning elixir?\nA single moment’s turning of the mechanism spins a year.\n\n**LXI**\nTo forge the illusory body of floating life into strength,\nThe initial foundation of effort is the root.\nOnly when cinnabar is refined to ripeness in the golden furnace\nIs one permitted to abide in non-action and guard the natural.\n\n**LXII**\nThe maiden and the infant are but metaphors,\nThe Yellow Dame too is but a figment of intent.\nThe true message pierces mountains and penetrates stone—\nWithout stepping beyond the gate, one knows all things.\n\n**LXIII**\nMouth-bound samadhi needs no discussion,\nFor lofty discourse shuts the door on itself.\nEven if words flow swiftly, the heart remains unenlightened—\nIn the end, one merely toys with essence and spirit.\n\n**LXIV**\nUnversed in scriptures, unconcerned with Chan,\nOne simply revolves the three natures through the three fields.\nWhen the elixir of immortality is refined in the jade furnace,\nOne becomes a minor immortal of Penglai.\n\n**LXV**\nThe celestial mechanism is not distant, the medicine not remote—\nStir the celestial pivot, and earth responds like the tide.\nA single breath of dark sincerity ascends the great Dao,\nThe numinous elixir congeals, forged within the fire.\n\n**LXVI**\nThe immortal’s Dao is most simple, most easy,\nYet rare to encounter, rare to hear even half a word.\nIf one receives the true master’s oral transmission,\n\"My life is in my hands, not heaven’s.\"\n\n**LXVII**\nThe bellows’ gate opens, the wind of Xun stirs,\nFrom the deep pool emerges a crimson wheel.\nLifting one’s gaze, the path to the azure heavens lies near—\nAlone, one carries the golden toad into the jade palace.\n\n**LXVIII**\nThe primordial beginning hangs suspended like a millet-grain pearl,\nIts flowing light enters the sea to form a golden scripture.\nThe numinous and true ascend, floating through the void,\nAll sages gather to convene at the jade pivot.\n\n**LXIX**\nSeizing the tiger and capturing the dragon into the jade flask,\nThe Dao’s loftiness naturally draws the aid of ghosts and spirits.\nOne need not distinguish self from others—\nTo transcend death and surpass life is the mark of a true man.\n\n**LXX**\nThe path ahead is short, the path behind is long,\nStraight up the capital mountain, one meets the Jade Emperor.\nAfter feasting in the Jasper Pool, returning to the grotto palace,\nOne is bestowed a name and appointed Lord of Thunder.\n\n**LXXI**\nWhen fierce demons and specters suddenly deceive,\nThey repeatedly lead one into illusion and delusion.\nWith a single flourish of the fire-pen, golden lightning strikes—\nThe ten directions and three realms all submit.\n\n**LXXII**\nAt times, one joins the assembly of immortals in the nine palaces,\nRiding a jade-green chariot drawn by flying dragons in the cinnabar clouds.\nThe primordial spirit turns back beneath the capital mountain—\nA single moon hangs above the terrace, illuminating the azure sky.\n\n**LXXIII**\nDo not dismiss the elixir’s refinement as empty words—\nA day’s work makes a day’s immortal.\nIf one further aids others and upholds sagely transformation,\nWhat worry is there that this body will not ascend to heaven?\n\n**LXXIV**\nWith fierce awakening and steadfast resolve, one sees the truth intimately,\nThe *Yinfu* returns thrice to refine form and spirit.\nCirculating once, the void shatters—\nA thousand miles without clouds, the moon’s light renewed.\n\n**LXXV**\nThe four seas are at peace, the nation is naturally secure,\nWhen one ruler embodies the Dao, ten thousand ministers stand in awe.\nAt such a time, only civil influence is needed—\nWhy resort to arms and subdue the barbarians?\n\n**LXXVI**\nThe path between heaven and earth is not remote—\nRiding a deer in the Dark Capital, one ascends the azure heavens.\nThe phoenix flute’s melody enters the Palace of Heng’e,\nA myriad measures of pure fragrance, osmanthus seeds drift.\n\n**LXXVII**\nA single silence, a turn of inner light—all phenomena dissolve,\nUnknowing, one dwells in the crystal palace.\nThe message within holds no excess—\nPiercing stone and traversing mountains, every path is open.\n\n**LXXVIII**\nThe immortal’s wondrous secret is not lightly spoken,\nOnly those of steadfast faith are entrusted with its transmission.\nOnce these distinctions are made clear,\nWith every step, the cart remains beneath heaven.\n\n**LXXIX**\nSage after sage transmits but a single heart,\nOne who receives this heart’s transmission is a true kindred spirit.\nThough one peruses all books, no trace remains—\nYet one penetrates earth and sky, shining through the ages.\n\n**LXXX**\nTen thousand volumes of elixir scriptures point to the mysterious chapter,\nEach line compels one to seek its profundity.\nIf one is willing to delve deeply into its core,\nWhich household’s gate will not face heaven?\n\n**LXXXI**\nWhen the elixir is perfected through nine revolutions, one naturally surpasses the multitude,\nWith merit complete and the path fulfilled, one moves the Emperor of Heaven.\nA single imperial edict descends in broad daylight—\nThe body soars in purple mist to pay homage at the golden gate.\n\n*Nineteen Songs of Wandering Immortals*",
