  "full_translation": "**Wang Fuzhi’s *Understanding Zhuangzi*: Preface**\n\nIn the spring of the *jiwei* year, I took refuge from war in the Zhulin Mountains, dwelling in a humble hut. Amid the silence where no clamor stirred, I sat in stillness and turned my thoughts inward: I have carried a heart that cannot speak, moving through a world where paths never cross. For five years, I have drifted at its edge, unable to depart. My responses have been meager, faintly resembling Zhuangzi’s art—could I not feel deep shame?\n\nYet I am no disciple of Zhuangzi. There are things I cannot accept, and the doctrine of “walking two paths” leaves me no choice but to seek understanding through this way. Thus, I reconcile it with the principles of the heart. The conduct of Yan Yuan, Qu Boyu, and the Duke of She; the appearance of Shushan Wuzhi and Ai Taituo—all serve to open my heart. If the heart seeks benevolence, what could be impossible?\n\nSome say, “Zhuangzi lived in an age of seven warring states, hence his words.” Even so, one who embodies Zhuangzi’s spirit might not act thus, but for me to grasp his meaning is all the more fitting. I am like the man with a great goiter, or one without proper robes; I dwell “between talent and lack thereof.” Those who know me say my heart is troubled; those who do not ask what I seek. Who truly knows me? To say I employ Zhuangzi’s art to beg escape from “Yi’s drawn bow” is not something I can deny, yet I have long been unable to perceive Master Hu’s revelation between “heaven and earth.”\n\nAll of Zhuangzi’s teachings can be used to illuminate the Dao of the noble person, as in this case. Thus, whether Zhuangzi himself attained this or not, one may still perfect a single discourse.\n\nWritten on the *furi* day of this year by the Ginger-Selling Elder of Nanyue.\n\n---\n\n**Free and Easy Wandering**\n\nFew and many, long and short, light and heavy, great and small—none are fixed pairs. Embrace the few, and it becomes many; embrace the short, and it becomes long; embrace the light, and it becomes heavy; embrace the small, and it becomes great. Thus, they are not fixed pairs.\n\nIf the great already contains the small, then the small can become great. Yet to draw a rigid boundary between great and small, I know not whence it arises. Then why can the great not be made small, only to be constrained by greatness? Why can the small not be made great, only to be constrained by smallness? Without boundaries to draw, where do constraints arise?\n\nThe great is not incapable of being small; its inability to be small is dictated by circumstance. The small is not incapable of being great; its inability to be great is shaped by disposition. The world has its forces—such is the “whirlwind” that lifts one aloft. My heart has its forces—such are the “wings that span the sky.”\n\nYet the “thickness” of force arises from accumulation: the “whirlwind” is but the breath of living things; the “wings that span the sky” are but a single feather’s lightness. Thus, though force may take shape, the great’s inherent smallness remains. Force is but pride, and pride is the eye seized by what has taken form. When the eye is seized by form and the heart clings to what is already so, then those constrained by greatness suffer twice the affliction of those constrained by smallness.\n\nWhy? Because the heart clings to what is already so, and those constrained by smallness have no fixed form to seize their gaze. Driven by force, they do not cease until they have soared “ninety thousand *li*”—yet they have passed the “mulberry and catalpa,” only to lose them. The “whirlwind” cannot hover over the “mulberry and catalpa”; the “gentle breeze” cannot wander through towns and states. The finest ceremonial cap is unfit for Yue. The constraints of force are even more severe than those of disposition.\n\nDisposition may be clear and bright, but force is adept at delusion—is this not extreme? Thus, “riding the uprightness of heaven and earth” means not being startled by the forces of heaven and earth; “driving the transformations of the six qi” means not chasing the forces of the six qi. This must be so.\n\nWithout greatness, there is “no self”; without greatness, there is “no merit”; without greatness, there is “no fame.” Then why cling to smallness? Yet who can truly achieve this? Only by knowing how to embrace the few can one not shun the few when many arise; only by knowing how to embrace the short can one not reject the short when long arises; only by knowing how to embrace the light can one not overlook the light when heavy arises; only by knowing how to embrace the small can one not forget the small when great arises.\n\nTo not forget the small is to be able to forget the small. Forgetting both small and great, yet “what is not forgotten remains”—refined and molded thus, one becomes a Yao or Shun.\n\n---\n\n**The Equality of Things**\n\nTo discuss the “comparison of bamboo pipes”—is the one who discusses not the one who blows them? If man is the “comparison of bamboo pipes,” is heaven not the one who blows them? If heaven is the “comparison of bamboo pipes,” is the sudden arising of the mechanism not the one who blows them?\n\nThen across the vastness of the four seas, through the length of ten thousand years, in the subtlety of a single breath or the might of thunder, I cannot rely solely on my ears and mouth, nor can I rely solely on my heart. How profound is my limitation!\n\nTo “illuminate with heaven” without speaking—this is attainment. Not speaking is because something compels me not to speak; illuminating is because something compels me to illuminate—both are causes. If I wish not to be moved by that which is not myself, and escape into emptiness, yet emptiness is also that—where then can I flee? How profound is my limitation!\n\nThose who have not penetrated this wander in limitation yet believe themselves boundless, and those who have penetrated it laugh at them. Those who have penetrated this wander in boundlessness, yet find no path that is not limiting.\n\nHeaven and earth are nowhere without their *qi*; the ten thousand things are nowhere without their mechanisms. Touch them, and you depart from them; depart from them, and you touch them. Inevitably, one speaks of equality. I will equalize the discourse of things, and the discourse of things will equalize me—what can be done?\n\nWhen wisdom is exhausted and the Dao is lost, to seek another secure refuge and say, “The sage embraces it”—can this not be called the most skillful of strategies?\n\nThough this be so, I shall yet argue. To embrace it—does this mean to flee in relation to things? To flee in relation to things is still to contend with them. Why? One flees because one resents yielding to things, resents following things, resents standing in opposition to things with no means of mutual growth. If there is any mind of resentment, then contention is already present. To flee without yielding, to flee without following, to flee without standing in opposition—believing that one may thus grow mutually—all this is still contention. To contend with them is to harbor a mechanism more perilous than discourse; within the silence and obstruction, there is thunder. \"The argument that does not speak\" is still an argument of right and wrong; \"the Dao that is not spoken\" is still a Dao of glory and splendor. Those who do not become \"people of wind and waves\" are few—what need then for the sage?\n\nTo embrace it is to \"blend the myriad ages into one pure whole.\" Thus, to speak what others have already spoken is not to fear following; to speak what others have not spoken is not to encounter yielding; to speak what others cannot or dare not speak is not merely to seek mutual growth. Why? What has been spoken, what has not been spoken, what cannot be spoken, what dare not be spoken—all are present within the myriad ages. One may speak or not speak; to speak is to embrace, and not to speak is also to embrace. Thus, Yao and Shun do not condemn Tang and Wu; the branch and the deer do not condemn rites and music. Benevolence and righteousness have no fixed beginning, gain and loss no fixed bounds. One hesitates, looks in all directions, exhausts one’s store, and only then secures a refuge to make it firm.\n\nIf this is so, then how can it be called a strategy of choice? The sage has no strategy. In *The Pivot of Nurturing Life*, \"to enter the space with no thickness\"—this is not to seek dominion over one’s spirit. He who dominates his spirit will be gladly dominated by the world; when the world gladly dominates him, the world too is dominated. In ancient times, Tang dominated his spirit, and Wei, Gu, and Kunwu were dominated; King Wen dominated his spirit, and Chong Houhu, Feilian, and Elai were dominated; Mencius dominated his spirit, and Yang Zhu and Mo Di were dominated. When the spirit dominates here, poison dominates there; when poison dominates there, the spirit cannot rest and seeks further dominion. This is why the noble men of old ended their lives in sorrow and did not spare their own existence.\n\nFor \"no thickness\" means that what encounters it is singular, while thickness means that what encounters it is vast. When what encounters it is vast, what is encountered is not the space. If the space is not encountered, and what is not the space contends with me in place of the space, the space retreats where the blade does not reach. Even the noble man cannot but feel sorrow in this—yet there is a way to handle it. \"Life has its limits,\" thus the spirit has its limits, and what it encounters is also limited. The rest is preserved but not discussed, left untended, caressed but not punished. In this, the dominion of the spirit is uniquely subtle.\n\nThe myriad things—the harmonizing of the two qi, the stirring of the eight winds, the discrepancies of the seven regulators, the barriers of towering mountains and great rivers—who can resist them? Thus, the warrior’s weapon does not multiply its enemies; the noble man’s teaching does not pursue the past. The world’s minds are boundless, yet they may be swayed by one or two things. To end one’s life in sorrow yet not oppose sorrow—there is no other way than to have a warp. The warp is the guiding thread; the guiding thread is the upright; the upright is that which has no thickness. To turn against the warp and not contend with the world in cunning and calculation—who would call the noble man’s dominion over his spirit a cage?\n\n*In the Human World*\nThe ears and eyes receive things, and the mind governs things. \"To pursue the ears and eyes in inward communication while being external to the mind’s knowledge\"—this is to avoid \"following the mind.\" Following the mind is not as good as following the ancients; following the ancients is not as good as following Heaven; following Heaven is not as good as following things. Why? If one wishes to navigate *In the Human World*, the mind is the means of navigation, not what is navigated. What the ancients navigated is not what I navigate. Only Heaven can navigate by means of Heaven—this is not how I navigate. Now, what I navigate is merely things—how then can I not take things as my teacher?\n\nThe tyranny of the Lord of Wei, the alliances of Chu and Qi, the rebellion of Kuai Kui—all are teachers. What in the world cannot be a teacher? Yet I have surveyed the world and lamented the difficulty of human affairs. Before the mediocre, straightforward speech is clumsier than devious speech; before the envious, veiled words are more perilous than direct words. The \"useless tree\" is often felled without cause. The \"useless use\" is still a use—once used, it is endangered.\n\nWhat is feared in following the mind is to carry the mind and roam with the world. If one who follows things carries things and roams with the world, then things too become a gate, and the gate too becomes poison. To close the gate and secure the mind within, or to open the gate and safeguard oneself through things—both bring the sorrow of extreme arrival. Han Fei knew the difficulty of persuasion and was executed for his persuasion; Yang Xiong knew that whiteness could not be preserved and died for his profundity. Their intentions differed, but the harm was the same—why not seek the cause of this harm?\n\nTo tread in a perilous age, to associate with chaotic people, to lament one’s own misfortune yet not be useless—how can this be taken as a standard for calculating good and ill fortune? There is a Dao here: to speak of it is easy, to practice it is not laborious, yet those who have known it through the ages are few. Thus, Li Si sighed for the dog at the Eastern Gate, Lu Ji lamented the cranes of Huating, while Long Feng and Bi Gan are not counted among them. There is no other reason: it is a matter of emptiness and non-emptiness.\n\nThe world is not enough to burden one with solidity, yet solidity fills the \"chamber of living whiteness,\" causing confusion and ignorance of the \"abiding of auspiciousness.\" Life and death are thus, fortune and misfortune are thus, praise and blame are thus—all is thus.\n\nThese eight solidities are the accumulations that fill the heart—what ancient and modern people have revered as teachers and dared not transgress. When these eight are emptied, nothing in the world remains unemptied; thus, all things become traversable. To fretfully dwell on what is to be feared and avoid it is to find no end to avoidance. If things cannot be fully avoided, how much less can Heaven’s life and death? \"How could one have leisure to delight in life and detest death?\" This is why Long Feng and Bi Gan endure to this day, no different from the useless tree.\n\n*Virtue’s Full Token*\nOne of virtue who prides himself on the appearance of virtue is merely a man of appearances; one of virtue who prides himself on virtue’s lack of appearance is merely a man of no appearance. \"The Dao gives him his countenance\"—countenance is one with the Dao; \"Heaven gives him his form\"—form is one with Heaven. \"Life and death are indeed great, yet they cannot alter him.\" Thus, to be born of the Dao is to die in the Dao; to be born of Heaven is to die in Heaven. The Dao is never without countenance, and no countenance is not the Dao; Heaven is never without form, and no form is not Heaven. Then to be born of form is to die in form, to be born of countenance is to die in countenance—life and death may be forgotten, yet these have never departed from him.\n\nTo serve appearances with the Dao is to be a man of artifice. To serve life with appearances is to be a man of dissipation. To forget appearances through the Dao is merely to forget the Dao. The lame, the toe-less, the lipless, the goitered—even they do not lose their wholeness of virtue; how much less those who are not so afflicted? \"Forgetting what should not be forgotten\" and serving form is something people recognize as delusion. But if one \"does not forget what should not be forgotten,\" and form and countenance remain, this is how Heaven accomplishes, how accomplishment is made great—merging inner and outer, uniting the refined and the coarse, congealing the Dao and aligning with Heaven, so as not to lose what one has received.\n\nHow could the sage be one to nitpick over the trivialities of form and countenance? Alas! The folly of Duke Ling of Wei—seeing a lipless man and gazing at the full-necked as if they were mere shoulders. Alas! The folly of Duke Huan of Qi—seeing a goitered man and observing the full-necked as if they were mere shoulders. If these two rulers, with their towering caps and grand sashes, their high steps and raised brows, harbored ravines in their hearts and swords in their bellies, and had grasped this truth, they would have regarded the world’s most splendid appearances as though they were tainted with filth, fearing to distance themselves too late.\n\nThus, the token is the fullness of virtue; without virtue, there is no fullness, and without fullness, there is no token. Fullness without token is called a stolen token; virtue without fullness is called hollow fullness. Virtue that is not full is called declining virtue; fullness that does not match is called misaligned fullness. \"The Dao gives him his countenance\"—countenance mirrors the Dao; \"Heaven gives him his form\"—form repays Heaven.\n\nTo fuss over fame and reputation, repeatedly altering one’s Heaven-given form—why not inwardly preserve and outwardly remain unshaken, roaming within \"Yi’s drawn bow,\" so as not to lose one’s Heaven? Thus, his appearance is not the appearance of a man of appearances; his lack of appearance is not the lack of appearance of a man without appearance. To verify the token through virtue—no virtue is not a token; to align with virtue through the token—no token is not virtue. If one knows the world treats form and countenance as commodities but does not recognize them as tokens, how can one know virtue?\n\n*The Great Ancestral Master*\n\"Heel-breathing\" is the beginning of instruction, yet it encompasses the Way of the perfected person. \"The vastness of Heaven is One\"—there is no room for the human. From the heel upward, there is nothing that is not Heaven, nothing that is not the One, and yet it is already vast. \"Going against the few,\" \"the male’s completion,\" \"the counselor’s deliberation\"—all are \"throat-breathing.\" \"Delighting in life,\" \"detesting death,\" \"joy in emergence,\" \"resistance in retreat\"—all are \"throat-breathing.\" \"Joy in connecting with things,\" \"having kin,\" \"timeliness\"—all are \"throat-breathing.\" \"Punishment,\" \"ritual,\" \"knowledge,\" \"virtue\"—all are \"throat-breathing.\" \"Likes and dislikes\"—all are \"throat-breathing.\"\n\nDrawing it up to the heel: the few also go against, completion is also male, the scholar also deliberates, life is also delightful, death is also detestable, emergence is also joyful, retreat is also resistant, connecting with things is also joyful, kin are also present, timing is also Heaven, punishment is also embodied, ritual is also auxiliary, knowledge is also timely, virtue is also followed, likes are also liked, dislikes are also disliked. Those who die for fate do so without relying on the throat. Here, it is vast, immeasurable, inexhaustible—beyond achievement, beyond naming. It spans ten thousand years, embraces ten thousand things, yet is neither Heaven nor the One—who could surpass this?\n\nThe world loves depth but alone trivializes its Heavenly mechanism. Thus, it indulges in excessive punishments and extravagant rituals, outwardly admires virtue yet frequently employs knowledge, and forms cliques of likes and dislikes under the banner of righteousness—all to deepen its cravings. Below the throat, cravings occupy it, leaving only the throat to receive Heaven and immediately expel it. This is the common affliction of past and present, yet those who speak of the Dao cannot abandon it.\n\nHeaven is empty, thus it receives; Heaven is full, thus it selects. To receive and not be able to expel is neither Heaven nor the One—like choking in the chest, longing for a single release. To select and find it insufficient is neither Heaven nor the One—then one alters ruler and minister, inverts inner and outer, to prop up what one cannot reach, hoping for a swift response without shame.\n\nAlas! Those who know Heaven’s emptiness and Heaven’s fullness are few in ancient and modern times. If so, one does not seek it elsewhere: simply take what one breathes and draw it up to the heel—nothing is heard, nothing is lacking.\n\nWho is it that makes one startle upon hearing \"Deputy Ink,\" sober upon hearing \"Luo Recitation,\" flee upon hearing \"Gazing Clarity,\" sate upon hearing \"Nie Xu,\" swat at mosquitoes upon hearing \"Need and Service,\" or tremble as if struck by a howling gale upon hearing \"Yu Song\"? Using desires to remedy desires, when these prove insufficient, one grasps at the Dao to sustain them—thus the world remains shallow, and Heaven loses its mechanism. Then Heaven, too, grows sorrowful.\n\nSealing the door to await another’s entry, yet none enters, Heaven becomes hollow. When Heaven grieves, nothing fails to grieve; thus one shudders and flickers, spending a lifetime as a throat, bearing cares that pierce even unto death. When Heaven is hollow, all it does is hollow; to clash with hollowness is never to find peace. Yet the world’s love of depth, and the suffering of attaining depth, are but shallowness in the end. Draw it to the heel—this is the utmost. Even if one reaches \"Vast Heaven’s Oneness,\" one cannot abandon this as a remedy.\n\n\"Assuming human form\" for a hundred years, one exhausts all within one’s store before knowing that Heaven’s Oneness is indeed vast. *Responding to Emperors and Kings*—the world has never departed from \"our origin,\" yet is startled by the multitude of things: laughing at one event, flinching at another, dazzled by this, fixated on that—believing this teeming world lies beyond our origin. Thus, thinking one can welcome it without loss, one \"hides benevolence to entice others\"; believing one can govern by having a master, one \"issues canons from oneself\"; believing one can exhaust it by embodying all, one \"wearies body and startles heart\" to meet the world’s demands. All this is to admire the sage’s achievement without knowing how it is achieved.\n\nThe world has never departed from our origin, yet it constantly fails to know this. If one knows it has not departed from our origin, then in utmost stillness, one is \"unshaken,\" and its mechanism is \"blocked virtue\"; in utmost depth, one is \"unrippled,\" and its mechanism is \"heel-activation\"; in utmost ease, one is receptive, in utmost restraint, one is all-containing—its mechanism is \"the abyss.\" Only by not losing our origin and receiving the world without departing from it can one \"flow,\" can one \"yield,\" with nothing beyond the Dao, and ten thousand changes insufficient to startle. Yet what is called \"origin\" must have an origin. If one does not seek it elsewhere, is it not Heaven alone?\n\nI and the Son of Heaven are both children of Heaven—thus the Son of Heaven is no different. The Son of Heaven and the world are both children of Heaven—thus the world is no different. The Dao returns to the Dao alone, virtue to virtue alone, achievement to achievement alone, fame to fame alone, profit to profit alone, desires to desires alone. The Dao is also virtue, virtue is also achievement, achievement is also fame, fame is also profit, profit is also desire, desire is also the Dao. The Dao does not depart from our origin; though there be worthy and wise, none can surpass it. Desires do not depart from our origin; though there be rebels and tyrants, none can deceive it. Not startling the world, one need not fear one’s own scarcity. With no scarcity in me, the world has no excess—without calling it \"one,\" one cannot.\n\n\"Hiding the world within the world,\" all is hidden within our origin. Naming it without becoming its corpse, scheming without becoming its storehouse, acting without becoming its burden, knowing without becoming its master; being its corpse without being named, its storehouse without scheming, its burden without acting, its master without knowing. Though one dam the floodwaters of a deluge or shoulder the fierce renown of banishment, emperors remain emperors, kings remain kings—never departing from our origin, why trouble oneself with carving?\n\n*Superfluous Toes*—what the body originally lacks, what use does not require, arising without cause, relying on it for security: gain brings joy, loss brings sorrow—this is what is meant by the undetachable superfluous growths. Not being Zeng or Shi yet imitating Zeng or Shi, not being the Yu clan yet imitating the Yu clan, not being Boyi yet imitating Boyi—these are \"color-seizing\" and \"forced growth.\" Regarding benevolence and righteousness as external and observing or listening to them, one fails to know the union or separation of name and reality. Hearing for oneself, one does not obscure its sound; seeing for oneself, one does not obscure its form. If benevolence and righteousness are indeed so, can one decide with five fingers and two palms? Can one gnaw at them? It is not merely hating tears and fearing wails.\n\nKnowing benevolence is not distant, knowing righteousness is internal, one flees one’s fate rather than fleeing benevolence and righteousness. Boyi starved without resentment—what wailing is there? What one hates in harming life and damaging nature is that it is followed by wails.\n\n*Horse Hooves*—without bit and bridle, what use is a horse? Without carving and crafting, what use is wood? Without becoming a sacrificial vessel, what use is unworked timber? Without becoming a ritual jade, what use is raw jade? Without adopting benevolence and righteousness, what use is the Dao? Those who \"stride and pry, competing for profit\"—this is the sage’s error, yet the sage bears it without refusal. Knowing the sage’s practice of the Dao, bearing error without refusal, how then can one repay the sage’s virtue without daring to obscure it?\n\n*Opening Chests*—the sage cannot be killed; the great thief cannot be stopped. Since the thief cannot be stopped, the sage indeed cannot be killed. Knowing the sage cannot be killed and the great thief cannot be stopped, one can only accept it with the Dao.\n\nStill they crane their necks and lift their heels, pointing to worthies and sages as mere names while pursuing their own private gain—yet they would halt the thief. How rare that this does not breed great chaos! Knowing their profound unity, and thereby generating the Dao’s laws, the sage daily renews while the great thief daily recedes. Who then would brandish benevolence and righteousness as a \"thief’s reed pipe\"?\n\n**Embracing and Allowing**\nThe movements of the human heart may be known, or they may not. What cannot be known is the heart’s celestial nature. Those who govern the world invariably govern what can be known, never what cannot. Governing what can be known, they find the heart already stirred, then proceed to impose order upon it: they apply \"sagely wisdom\" to the cangue, \"benevolence and righteousness\" to the fetters, and the likes of Zengzi and Shi Yu to Jie and Zhi—never matching person to person but only clashing them together. To call this \"agitating the human heart\" would not be wrong.\n\nWhy is this so? Governing what can be known, they secure names to be born, laws to be enacted, and achievements to be displayed. Thus, they need not possess the reality of sagely wisdom, benevolence, righteousness, Zengzi, or Shi Yu, yet they may still proclaim to the world, \"We have governed it.\" As for what cannot be known—where there is no reality, how can there be a name? Where there is no image, how can there be a law? Where there is no failure, how can there be merit? The traces of name, law, and merit vanish, so those who flaunt their governance before the world do not engage with them.\n\nYet when the human heart has not yet arisen, there is nothing to agitate. To submit early to the unknowable is merely to govern the self. Be cautious in joy, and the world will not be licentious; be cautious in anger, and the world will not be predatory. When joy and anger guard their knowledge, the world does not run wild.\n\nThe source of utmost yang illuminates all things; the source of utmost yin conceals all things. Illuminating all things is not to illuminate things; concealing all things is not to conceal things. Each thing returns to its root, and its nature rights itself. Things inherently live, and their dispositions naturally unfold. Things do not know themselves, yet indifferently they halt their own excess and predation. This is the thoroughness of sagely wisdom, and how Zengzi and Shi Yu found their own tranquility. In finding tranquility, the world becomes tranquil.\n\nHeaven and earth are what the myriad things rely upon to settle themselves. \"Great and small, long and short, near and far\"—each has its completed measure. There is no other reason: one’s vision stops at the visible, and so one preserves it. Rejoicing in gain, raging at loss, clinging to completed forms while ignoring whether the world is so or not—this is the great malady of past and present.\n\nThe formless is not truly formless; one simply does not see it. Knowing that the formless has form and the shapeless has shape, even \"great and small, long and short, near and far\" can no longer be fixed—how much less the myriad things? The formless is about to take form; the shapeless is about to take shape. Stillness contains movement; movement lingers and gives birth to things. Things arise in an instant, yet their origins always precede them. One moment’s lingering, and form is complete.\n\nKnowing this, can one fail to guard stillness and listen for movement? Stillness without reliance ensures movement without exhaustion. Its movement is necessarily upright, its lingering necessarily fruitful, its birth necessarily harmonious. Heaven and earth’s generation of things and the sage’s initiation of affairs are one and the same.\n\nThough the heart may be hollowed out, it hollows only the heart that clings to fixed judgments, while something must remain within. \"Seeing clarity,\" \"hearing harmony,\" \"officiating heaven and earth,\" \"storing the myriad things\"—yet none can fathom it. Not that none can fathom it, but the world fathoms it only in terms of \"great and small, long and short, near and far.\" As for the formless all taking form, the shapeless all taking shape, each measuring itself and righting its own nature and destiny—none can fathom this.\n\nThe Dao of heaven, when empty, can be filled with anything; when still, it can move anything. To be fillable with anything, movable with anything—this is the union of heaven and humanity. \"Revolving without accumulation\" is called emptiness: the passage of past and present without amassing their dregs. \"Nothing in the myriad things suffices to disturb the heart\" is called stillness: following the forms and names of one’s joy and anger.\n\nEmptiness and stillness describe the state of abiding in virtue. They are not fleeing reality to attain emptiness or blocking movement to attain stillness. Fleeing emptiness and blocking movement, one flees all the more while things accumulate. \"Sticky and chaotic,\" daily disturbing the heart, vexed and seeking escape in death—death itself becomes a burden, leaving the dregs of emptiness and stillness to encumber later generations. Thus, beneath the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, the school of punishments and names arose, burdening endlessly.\n\nHow much more in the days of one’s life, anxiously struggling all day, competing with clamor, and harboring resentment? Within emptiness and stillness, heaven and earth advance, the myriad things flow through, and there is no greater joy. Those who embody this will clearly not clamorously set emptiness and stillness as a goal and disturb the heart in pursuit of it.\n\nThe workings of heaven’s transformation are subtle indeed!\n\nThe marvel and vastness of transformation are profound indeed! The spirit-person, thus in heaven and earth, sun and moon, clouds and rain, wind and thunder—movement only brings forth more. Subtle is its mechanism, so those who seek its causes can never fathom it. Observing from its subtlety, one doubts whether there is any transformer at all; if no transformer exists, then \"nothing presides within,\" and how could it come to rest? Observing from its vastness, one doubts whether some wielder of control serves as its great overseer; if an overseer holds the power of control, then \"nothing is upright without,\" and it cannot be put into motion.\n\nThose in the world who apply their minds and employ things do not stray from these two extremes: some follow their fixed inclinations, others shift their intentions with things, both falling into the snares of \"great and small, long and short, cultivated and distant,\" yet none can escape. Neither extreme can be relied upon, and to abandon them in search of another path is only to grow more lost. Thus, one weighs the balance between inner and outer, embodying subtlety while employing vastness, using the center to裁 the outer—then the outer does not overflow; with emptiness at the center to receive the outer, the outer does not obstruct.\n\nThose who cultivate the mind and govern things—how could they not proceed thus?\n\nAll the world’s arts arise from preference. Preference gives rise to aversion, to sorrow, to joy, to delight, to anger. Clinging to what one prefers, one fails to consider even what is Dao though it lies before them. Failing to attain one’s preference brings worry; worry brings change, change brings conflict, and conflict inevitably leads to attachment, binding one’s interactions. When such bonds do not endure, they erupt and rush toward what was not preferred. Thus, though one may initially cling to preference within the Dao, in the end they cast the Dao aside as if forgotten—not only those who chase preferences in desires abandon the celestial mechanism.\n\nThough things may be preferred, one must know there is the Dao; though the Dao may be preferred, one must know there is essence. The Dao nurtures essence, not essence the Dao. Nothing in the world is prized but essence! Yet essence is what the mind deems acceptable, not what the Dao deems acceptable.\n\nTo refine one’s nature by clinging to names and principles as if they were already so, yet not knowing *why* they are so...\n\nFollowing the ebb of prevailing trends without clinging to any,\nCorrecting the excesses of worldly passions without overcompensating into greater extremes—\nSuch is the mark of the vulgar.\nTo govern the vulgar, thus arose ritual and music.\nThe origins of ritual and music predate Fuxi and Suiren.\nFuxi and Suiren guided the essence of ritual and music,\nBroadcasting their brilliance across the ten thousand things.\nYet the essence of the Three Sovereigns surpasses that of Huangdi and Zhuanxu—this is clear.\n\nThe subtlety of all under heaven is found in nothingness.\nThe subtlety of nothingness lies in having being within non-being,\nEmploying non-being to subtly activate movement.\nBenevolence and righteousness are emotions, not laws;\nRitual and music are of the Dao, not achievements.\nWhen ritual moves and music arises, they begin in nothingness and manifest as being.\nWithout words, without merit, they purify the vulgar and wander in truth.\nOne need not beat the drum of benevolence and righteousness to seek the lost child—\nSilent movement suffices.\n\nWhere the vulgar cannot reach,\nWhere beginnings remain whole,\nWhere clarity nurtures,\nWhere Cloud General roams,\nWhere Hong Meng departs,\nWhere Yu Qie rides the cool wind,\nHarmonized by celestial harmony—\n\"Knowing and tranquility mutually nurture,\"\nAnd nothing can alter this joy.\nWhat need has one for eminence and rank?\nThis is called \"attaining the essence of ritual and music.\"\n\nAutumn Floods\nThe Sea Lord abides in measure; the River Earl follows circumstance.\nOne who observes through measure:\nWhere measure reaches, it embraces and seems to forget;\nWhere measure does not reach, it reflects and surely knows existence.\nOne who swells with circumstance:\nWhere circumstance extends, it arrives;\nWhere circumstance does not extend, it cannot arrive.\n\n\"When autumn floods come, the hundred streams pour into the river,\"\nThe River Earl nearly narrows the sea’s expanse to self-sufficiency.\nWhen cold shallows recede and islets emerge,\nHe loses even his river—how much more the sea?\nIf the river could preserve its measure,\nThen in the river it would be the river, in the sea it would still be the river—what harm in that?\n\nThe abdications of Yao and Shun, the struggles of Tang and Wu, were matters of measure.\n\"Possessing the world yet not claiming it\"—what loss was there?\nThe abdication of Zi Kuai, the struggle of Bai Gong, were matters of circumstance.\nCircumstance unmaintained, and their inherent holdings were lost.\nMeasure and circumstance—\n\"The gate of nobility and baseness, the origin of small and great.\"\n\nUtmost Joy\nThe joy of the crowd rushes toward the mechanism of the ten thousand things’ ebb and flow;\nThe fame sought by the crowd contends at the mechanism of the human heart’s ebb and flow.\nOne whose sorrow and joy are settled finds joy not in mechanism;\nOne whose name and reality are settled contends not in mechanism.\nThus, some call it gain, some loss,\nSome life, some death—yet all are mistaken.\nThe multitude ebbs and flows with mechanism,\nSeeking within themselves and finding nothing.\nThen they divide gain and loss, life and death,\nJoy and non-joy—rightly so.\n\nThose with constant joy and constant name:\nLife and death cannot intervene, much less honor and disgrace.\nActing on what only they know,\nNot relying on qi-pride to seize fame—\nThen Wu Zixu’s death is like the transformation of green bamboo or the cicada’s molting.\nThe resolute take death as joy, death as fame—\nWhat can one expect from those who ride the mechanism!\n\nAttaining Life\n\"What knowledge cannot manage\" is not unknowable—\nThe limits of ears, eyes, heart, and thought end here.\nSince they end here,\nYet one still desires to manage what does not end here—how is this possible?\nNevertheless, knowledge is boundless.\nGuarding what one knows,\nMeasuring by one’s measure, counting by one’s count,\nAbiding here and exhausting one’s years—\nThis unmanageable is not easily managed,\nYet people, unable to manage it, instead seek to manage what is beyond management—\nThis is abandoning the human to consult ghosts.\nHuman and ghost do not reach one another,\nAnd leaving this to approach that—\nHow perilous for life and fate!\n\n\"Guarding the purity of qi\" is guarding what can be managed;\n\"Attaining wholeness in Heaven\" is preserving what can be managed;\n\"Opening life\" is opening what can be managed;\n\"Using the will without division\" is directing the will toward what can be managed;\n\"Valuing inner strength and feigning outer clumsiness\" is valuing what can be managed;\n\"Whipping the one who follows the sheep\" is whipping what can be managed;\n\"Lengthening one’s nature, completing one’s fate\" is completing what can be managed;\n\"Seeing the *ju*-vessel and then applying one’s hand\" is applying to what can be managed;\n\"Unifying without constraint\" is unifying what can be managed;\n\"Acting without reliance\" is acting on what can be managed.\nExhausting one’s years in what knowledge can manage—\nThen external, dissolute knowledge, undreamt even in dreams,\n\"Raising birds with birds,\" the *yuanju* can be tamed—\nHow much more one’s own liver and gall!\n\nMountain Trees\nFate is great, nature is small.\n\nWithin humanity lies nature; within heaven lies all that is fate. Once one is born human, one can master nature but not fate. What lies within humanity is all of heaven; what lies within the self is then human. Once one is established as a self, one can master the human but not heaven. The one who objectifies things knows that things are things and not nature. The one who is not objectified by things knows that things are not the self and does not accept their fate. Hunger, thirst, cold, heat, and the shackles of poverty—though unbearable—humans endure them, knowing them to be of heaven. The benefits of things, though one ought not to follow them, one follows, not knowing them to be of fate. Not knowing that things are of heaven and heaven is of fate, one then seeks what cannot be attained as if it could be attained—this is called the deluded mind. Humans cannot possess heaven; the self cannot possess things. Though one wishes to achieve success in what is right, one fundamentally cannot. To attempt achievement where one cannot is to grasp at the art of igniting fire in an empty sack—the world calls such a one a deluded person.\n\nTo be upright without reliance, not scheming for the worthy, not deceiving the unworthy, not seeking an end in sight, being cautious and circumspect in following what lies before one—this is the Way of the self that emerges from such a path, called \"between talent and lack of talent.\" It is not about maneuvering between talent and lack of talent to avoid harm. Tian Zifang was \"true\" but not \"entwined\"—this was not \"preservation\"; he was \"pure\" but cut off from \"things\"—this was not \"purity\"; he was \"crude in understanding human hearts\"—this was not \"illuminated in ritual and righteousness.\" Those who claim to be Confucians but are not true Confucians are many—they \"follow in steps\" but cannot \"leave the dust behind.\" They wait for the sun and moon to use their \"toes and eyes,\" yet they are those without toes and eyes. Toes have their purpose as toes, eyes have their purpose as eyes—what does not perish remains. By making night into day and day into night, preserving one’s spirit and clarity in \"discarding robes and sitting freely,\" then the world does not wait for eyes to see its brightness, does not wait for toes to emulate its movement, does not wait for words to dissolve its meaning.\n\nThe Way of the noble one has been spoken of this way many times—it is not only Zhuangzi who has said so. In *Knowing the Northern Journey*, \"blending ten thousand years into one pure whole\" is what makes unity precious. The multitude knows the instant, the wise know the season, those who establish resolve know the day, the self-examining know the month, the comprehensive know the year, the noble one knows the whole life, and the sage knows the pure. The more enduring their knowledge, the more they forget the petty. Alas! The night does not reach dawn, the morning does not reach dusk—seizing the moment to act, yet like fish in the flowing stream, flapping their fins and scales. Speaking only for fear of not exhausting words, acting only for fear of not reaching the utmost—taking this as diligence, as quickness, as subtlety. \"The morning mushroom knows not the dark and dawn, the cicada knows not spring and autumn\"—those who diminish their years to hasten toward death, this is called the death of the heart.\n\nGengsang Chu held to \"what cannot be held,\" using non-holding to hold without holding, and thus his \"cosmos was at peace.\" Holding to the \"spirit terrace,\" his peace was then settled. Only when the \"spirit terrace\" is like lightning does it emit the \"heavenly light.\" \"Heavenly light\" is heaven’s radiance illuminating our \"spirit terrace.\" The delusion of the multitude is that \"being real yet having nowhere to reside,\" they force a place for it; \"being long yet having no root or tip,\" they force a root or tip—this is like ice and frost. Thus their cosmos is not at peace, and they conceal their \"heavenly light.\" To be able to release ice and frost, to have nowhere to conceal and thus emit \"heavenly light\"—compared to others, this is worthy, what the Buddhists call \"samadhi giving rise to wisdom.\" Yet this is as far as it goes. When \"heavenly light\" shines upon the \"spirit terrace,\" one’s own light is concealed—thus \"heavenly light\" is what can illuminate others.\n\nWhen the formed is equal to the formless, \"heavenly light\" melts it like ice. When the formless takes form, \"heavenly light\" shines and one’s own light is concealed—face to face yet not recognizing each other, none can know. Holding \"what cannot be held,\" yet what holds remains. \"Using the formed to image the formless\" is not using the formless to break the formed. The formless is not nothing. Seek it in stillness, observe it in vastness—within the cosmos, there is no formless. \"Heavenly light\" shines and seizes our light, and thus we see form, see the formless—it cannot be held, yet it is not that the formless is inherently unholdable. The formed can be held, but the formless \"cannot be held\"; yet the formless \"cannot be held\" but is not nothing formless—thus it can fundamentally be held. The holding of Yao and Shun both revealed the form of the formless.\n\n\"When spring’s qi arises, a hundred grasses grow; when autumn’s proper moment arrives, ten thousand treasures mature\"—cultivating the formless to reveal its being, having no place yet being real, having no root or tip yet being long—none can resist it. How could this be what \"heavenly light\" can reveal? It is clear that the emission of \"heavenly light\" cannot be the ultimate vision.\n\nWhen Xu Wugui and Ze Yang exhausted human thought and speculation, they measured the Dao and said, \"No one acts\"; when they acknowledged that humans must have thought and speculation, they measured it and said, \"Something impels.\" Those who measure the Dao in the world have exhausted their words. Yet \"no one acts\" is unconvincing, and \"something impels\" is incoherent—yet things are indeed convincing and coherent. Knowing their convincingness, one does not question their coherence; knowing their coherence, one does not fret over their convincingness. A partial view cannot traverse a thousand miles—how much less can it grasp the great? If one must know it, then know it through the \"sage’s love for others.\" \"In loving others,\" why does it \"never end\"? One suspects \"something impels.\" \"In loving others, people give it a name, yet without being told, they do not know\"—one suspects \"no one acts.\" Yet \"no one acts,\" and it is done; \"something impels,\" yet there has never been one who impels. The sage’s benevolence is the heart-mind of heaven and earth, misty and unceasing, not claiming merit, not laboring for fame, not displaying virtue. This is heaven’s omen in the sage, the sage’s union with heaven.\n\nYet it is not that \"no one acts\" and thus leaves no trace, nor that \"something impels\" and thus steadfastly maintains its constancy. \"Not knowing how it is so\"—this is what people say of the sage. Yet the sage only appears so but is not truly so. Knowing how it is so, one may then be guided to \"not knowing how it is so.\" The sage’s relation to the Dao of heaven cannot be measured by human feelings, yet it is not unmeasurable. One cannot take the two exhausted extremes of \"no one acts\" and \"something impels\" and generalize them as \"not knowing how it is so.\" The heart-mind of heaven and earth is the benevolence of heaven and earth; the sage’s benevolence is the sage’s heart-mind.\n\nExternal things: \"External things cannot be relied upon\"—those who rely on them are bound by the suspended heart-mind. They may be swept away or die, grieve or lament, yet loyalty and filial piety do not depend on things. Though swept away, dead, grieving, or lamenting, their harmony is never scorched. If one exhausts oneself and demands of things, encountering their \"errant ways\" will bring \"great calamity.\" Thunderous rage erupts and dark fires wildly rise—these are the inevitable results of oneself and things \"rubbing against\" one another. Loyalty and filial piety that do not scorch their harmony—how could the Dao ever be exhausted?\n\nThus, when parched, one begs for \"the waters of the Western River\"—this is extravagance toward the greatness of things. Raising a pole to \"guard minnows and tadpoles\"—this is confinement to the smallness of things. \"Carrying\" and \"prizing\" them, one takes things as praise or blame. \"Knowing exhaustion\" yet \"spirit does not reach\"—this is being deluded by the dreams of things. To clash with the world over loyalty and filial piety, with a heart full yet \"blocking its own apertures\"—this is why those of fame and principle harbor resentment and are not at peace with the Dao. Knowing this, the Dao is settled within oneself and does not depend on things. Knives, saws, water, and fire—can one not traverse them? How could these be an affliction to loyalty and filial piety!\n\nThe *Four Chapters on Yielding the Throne* are spurious texts, vulgar and contradictory, impossible to reconcile with the world. There is no greater affliction than \"practicing methods of governance,\" no deeper delusion than \"delighting in rumors upon hearing them,\" and no more pernicious harm than \"the disputers of the world taking pleasure in one another’s debates.\"\n\nThe sage recognizes that Heaven’s generation of oneself—what one walks in, what one is accustomed to—is nothing but fate, nothing but nature. Though one walks through life without attaining its end, one’s words may seem hesitant, but how could there be leisure to indulge in fame, chase after pleasure, or monopolize methods of governance to glorify oneself?\n\nThe Dao in the world is \"nowhere absent,\" yet one cannot exhaust its choices, nor keep pace with its unfolding. Even a lifetime spent in this pursuit cannot exhaust it—how then could there be leisure to trumpet one’s \"thread of literary refinement\"?\n\n*\"The* Poetry *expresses the will, the* Documents *narrates affairs, the* Rites *guides conduct, the* Music *harmonizes, the* Changes *illuminates yin and yang, and the* Spring and Autumn *defines names and duties.\"* The Dao is guidance; guidance is transmission. Transmitting what is already so, \"without transmitting its superfluous words,\" allows others to pour for themselves from the great vessel.\n\nThe great vessel is the shared instrument of the world. I have no desire to act as others’ teacher, yet the work of Heaven in my stead is complete. Thus, the *Spring and Autumn* is a book of punishments and rewards, \"discussing without debating\"—hence, \"without reward yet encouraging, without anger yet awe-inspiring.\"\n\nThe likes of Mo Di, Qin Guli, Song Jian, Yin Wen, Peng Meng, Tian Pian, Shen Dao, Guan Yin, Lao Dan, and Hui Shi—neither punishing nor rewarding—debate endlessly, becoming no more than \"the hollows of mountain forests’ fine trees, great trunks of a hundred spans,\" comparable to the unison of bamboo flutes. Like the *Spring and Autumn*’s refusal to debate, what harmony could they achieve?\n\nThus, observing the *Spring and Autumn*, it is fitting that Zhuangzi had no wish to pair with the world.",

      "translated_text": "**Wang Fuzhi’s *Understanding Zhuangzi*: Preface**\n\nIn the spring of the *jiwei* year, I took refuge from war in the Zhulin Mountains, dwelling in a humble hut. Amid the silence where no clamor stirred, I sat in stillness and turned my thoughts inward: I have carried a heart that cannot speak, moving through a world where paths never cross. For five years, I have drifted at its edge, unable to depart. My responses have been meager, faintly resembling Zhuangzi’s art—could I not feel deep shame?\n\nYet I am no disciple of Zhuangzi. There are things I cannot accept, and the doctrine of “walking two paths” leaves me no choice but to seek understanding through this way. Thus, I reconcile it with the principles of the heart. The conduct of Yan Yuan, Qu Boyu, and the Duke of She; the appearance of Shushan Wuzhi and Ai Taituo—all serve to open my heart. If the heart seeks benevolence, what could be impossible?\n\nSome say, “Zhuangzi lived in an age of seven warring states, hence his words.” Even so, one who embodies Zhuangzi’s spirit might not act thus, but for me to grasp his meaning is all the more fitting. I am like the man with a great goiter, or one without proper robes; I dwell “between talent and lack thereof.” Those who know me say my heart is troubled; those who do not ask what I seek. Who truly knows me? To say I employ Zhuangzi’s art to beg escape from “Yi’s drawn bow” is not something I can deny, yet I have long been unable to perceive Master Hu’s revelation between “heaven and earth.”\n\nAll of Zhuangzi’s teachings can be used to illuminate the Dao of the noble person, as in this case. Thus, whether Zhuangzi himself attained this or not, one may still perfect a single discourse.\n\nWritten on the *furi* day of this year by the Ginger-Selling Elder of Nanyue.\n\n---\n\n**Free and Easy Wandering**\n\nFew and many, long and short, light and heavy, great and small—none are fixed pairs. Embrace the few, and it becomes many; embrace the short, and it becomes long; embrace the light, and it becomes heavy; embrace the small, and it becomes great. Thus, they are not fixed pairs.\n\nIf the great already contains the small, then the small can become great. Yet to draw a rigid boundary between great and small, I know not whence it arises. Then why can the great not be made small, only to be constrained by greatness? Why can the small not be made great, only to be constrained by smallness? Without boundaries to draw, where do constraints arise?\n\nThe great is not incapable of being small; its inability to be small is dictated by circumstance. The small is not incapable of being great; its inability to be great is shaped by disposition. The world has its forces—such is the “whirlwind” that lifts one aloft. My heart has its forces—such are the “wings that span the sky.”\n\nYet the “thickness” of force arises from accumulation: the “whirlwind” is but the breath of living things; the “wings that span the sky” are but a single feather’s lightness. Thus, though force may take shape, the great’s inherent smallness remains. Force is but pride, and pride is the eye seized by what has taken form. When the eye is seized by form and the heart clings to what is already so, then those constrained by greatness suffer twice the affliction of those constrained by smallness.\n\nWhy? Because the heart clings to what is already so, and those constrained by smallness have no fixed form to seize their gaze. Driven by force, they do not cease until they have soared “ninety thousand *li*”—yet they have passed the “mulberry and catalpa,” only to lose them. The “whirlwind” cannot hover over the “mulberry and catalpa”; the “gentle breeze” cannot wander through towns and states. The finest ceremonial cap is unfit for Yue. The constraints of force are even more severe than those of disposition.\n\nDisposition may be clear and bright, but force is adept at delusion—is this not extreme? Thus, “riding the uprightness of heaven and earth” means not being startled by the forces of heaven and earth; “driving the transformations of the six qi” means not chasing the forces of the six qi. This must be so.\n\nWithout greatness, there is “no self”; without greatness, there is “no merit”; without greatness, there is “no fame.” Then why cling to smallness? Yet who can truly achieve this? Only by knowing how to embrace the few can one not shun the few when many arise; only by knowing how to embrace the short can one not reject the short when long arises; only by knowing how to embrace the light can one not overlook the light when heavy arises; only by knowing how to embrace the small can one not forget the small when great arises.\n\nTo not forget the small is to be able to forget the small. Forgetting both small and great, yet “what is not forgotten remains”—refined and molded thus, one becomes a Yao or Shun.\n\n---\n\n**The Equality of Things**\n\nTo discuss the “comparison of bamboo pipes”—is the one who discusses not the one who blows them? If man is the “comparison of bamboo pipes,” is heaven not the one who blows them? If heaven is the “comparison of bamboo pipes,” is the sudden arising of the mechanism not the one who blows them?\n\nThen across the vastness of the four seas, through the length of ten thousand years, in the subtlety of a single breath or the might of thunder, I cannot rely solely on my ears and mouth, nor can I rely solely on my heart. How profound is my limitation!\n\nTo “illuminate with heaven” without speaking—this is attainment. Not speaking is because something compels me not to speak; illuminating is because something compels me to illuminate—both are causes. If I wish not to be moved by that which is not myself, and escape into emptiness, yet emptiness is also that—where then can I flee? How profound is my limitation!\n\nThose who have not penetrated this wander in limitation yet believe themselves boundless, and those who have penetrated it laugh at them. Those who have penetrated this wander in boundlessness, yet find no path that is not limiting.\n\nHeaven and earth are nowhere without their *qi*; the ten thousand things are nowhere without their mechanisms. Touch them, and you depart from them; depart from them, and you touch them. Inevitably, one speaks of equality. I will equalize the discourse of things, and the discourse of things will equalize me—what can be done?\n\nWhen wisdom is exhausted and the Dao is lost, to seek another secure refuge and say, “The sage embraces it”—can this not be called the most skillful of strategies?",

      "translated_text": "Though this be so, I shall yet argue. To embrace it—does this mean to flee in relation to things? To flee in relation to things is still to contend with them. Why? One flees because one resents yielding to things, resents following things, resents standing in opposition to things with no means of mutual growth. If there is any mind of resentment, then contention is already present. To flee without yielding, to flee without following, to flee without standing in opposition—believing that one may thus grow mutually—all this is still contention. To contend with them is to harbor a mechanism more perilous than discourse; within the silence and obstruction, there is thunder. \"The argument that does not speak\" is still an argument of right and wrong; \"the Dao that is not spoken\" is still a Dao of glory and splendor. Those who do not become \"people of wind and waves\" are few—what need then for the sage?\n\nTo embrace it is to \"blend the myriad ages into one pure whole.\" Thus, to speak what others have already spoken is not to fear following; to speak what others have not spoken is not to encounter yielding; to speak what others cannot or dare not speak is not merely to seek mutual growth. Why? What has been spoken, what has not been spoken, what cannot be spoken, what dare not be spoken—all are present within the myriad ages. One may speak or not speak; to speak is to embrace, and not to speak is also to embrace. Thus, Yao and Shun do not condemn Tang and Wu; the branch and the deer do not condemn rites and music. Benevolence and righteousness have no fixed beginning, gain and loss no fixed bounds. One hesitates, looks in all directions, exhausts one’s store, and only then secures a refuge to make it firm.\n\nIf this is so, then how can it be called a strategy of choice? The sage has no strategy. In *The Pivot of Nurturing Life*, \"to enter the space with no thickness\"—this is not to seek dominion over one’s spirit. He who dominates his spirit will be gladly dominated by the world; when the world gladly dominates him, the world too is dominated. In ancient times, Tang dominated his spirit, and Wei, Gu, and Kunwu were dominated; King Wen dominated his spirit, and Chong Houhu, Feilian, and Elai were dominated; Mencius dominated his spirit, and Yang Zhu and Mo Di were dominated. When the spirit dominates here, poison dominates there; when poison dominates there, the spirit cannot rest and seeks further dominion. This is why the noble men of old ended their lives in sorrow and did not spare their own existence.\n\nFor \"no thickness\" means that what encounters it is singular, while thickness means that what encounters it is vast. When what encounters it is vast, what is encountered is not the space. If the space is not encountered, and what is not the space contends with me in place of the space, the space retreats where the blade does not reach. Even the noble man cannot but feel sorrow in this—yet there is a way to handle it. \"Life has its limits,\" thus the spirit has its limits, and what it encounters is also limited. The rest is preserved but not discussed, left untended, caressed but not punished. In this, the dominion of the spirit is uniquely subtle.\n\nThe myriad things—the harmonizing of the two qi, the stirring of the eight winds, the discrepancies of the seven regulators, the barriers of towering mountains and great rivers—who can resist them? Thus, the warrior’s weapon does not multiply its enemies; the noble man’s teaching does not pursue the past. The world’s minds are boundless, yet they may be swayed by one or two things. To end one’s life in sorrow yet not oppose sorrow—there is no other way than to have a warp. The warp is the guiding thread; the guiding thread is the upright; the upright is that which has no thickness. To turn against the warp and not contend with the world in cunning and calculation—who would call the noble man’s dominion over his spirit a cage?\n\n*In the Human World*\nThe ears and eyes receive things, and the mind governs things. \"To pursue the ears and eyes in inward communication while being external to the mind’s knowledge\"—this is to avoid \"following the mind.\" Following the mind is not as good as following the ancients; following the ancients is not as good as following Heaven; following Heaven is not as good as following things. Why? If one wishes to navigate *In the Human World*, the mind is the means of navigation, not what is navigated. What the ancients navigated is not what I navigate. Only Heaven can navigate by means of Heaven—this is not how I navigate. Now, what I navigate is merely things—how then can I not take things as my teacher?\n\nThe tyranny of the Lord of Wei, the alliances of Chu and Qi, the rebellion of Kuai Kui—all are teachers. What in the world cannot be a teacher? Yet I have surveyed the world and lamented the difficulty of human affairs. Before the mediocre, straightforward speech is clumsier than devious speech; before the envious, veiled words are more perilous than direct words. The \"useless tree\" is often felled without cause. The \"useless use\" is still a use—once used, it is endangered.\n\nWhat is feared in following the mind is to carry the mind and roam with the world. If one who follows things carries things and roams with the world, then things too become a gate, and the gate too becomes poison. To close the gate and secure the mind within, or to open the gate and safeguard oneself through things—both bring the sorrow of extreme arrival. Han Fei knew the difficulty of persuasion and was executed for his persuasion; Yang Xiong knew that whiteness could not be preserved and died for his profundity. Their intentions differed, but the harm was the same—why not seek the cause of this harm?\n\nTo tread in a perilous age, to associate with chaotic people, to lament one’s own misfortune yet not be useless—how can this be taken as a standard for calculating good and ill fortune? There is a Dao here: to speak of it is easy, to practice it is not laborious, yet those who have known it through the ages are few. Thus, Li Si sighed for the dog at the Eastern Gate, Lu Ji lamented the cranes of Huating, while Long Feng and Bi Gan are not counted among them. There is no other reason: it is a matter of emptiness and non-emptiness.\n\nThe world is not enough to burden one with solidity, yet solidity fills the \"chamber of living whiteness,\" causing confusion and ignorance of the \"abiding of auspiciousness.\" Life and death are thus, fortune and misfortune are thus, praise and blame are thus—all is thus.",

Touch them, and you depart from them; depart from them, and you touch them. Inevitably, one speaks of equality. I will equalize the discourse of things, and the discourse of things will equalize me—what can be done?\n\nWhen wisdom is exhausted and the Dao is lost, to seek another secure refuge and say, “The sage embraces it”—can this not be called the most skillful of strategies?",

      "translated_text": "These eight solidities are the accumulations that fill the heart—what ancient and modern people have revered as teachers and dared not transgress. When these eight are emptied, nothing in the world remains unemptied; thus, all things become traversable. To fretfully dwell on what is to be feared and avoid it is to find no end to avoidance. If things cannot be fully avoided, how much less can Heaven’s life and death? \"How could one have leisure to delight in life and detest death?\" This is why Long Feng and Bi Gan endure to this day, no different from the useless tree.\n\n*Virtue’s Full Token*\nOne of virtue who prides himself on the appearance of virtue is merely a man of appearances; one of virtue who prides himself on virtue’s lack of appearance is merely a man of no appearance. \"The Dao gives him his countenance\"—countenance is one with the Dao; \"Heaven gives him his form\"—form is one with Heaven. \"Life and death are indeed great, yet they cannot alter him.\" Thus, to be born of the Dao is to die in the Dao; to be born of Heaven is to die in Heaven. The Dao is never without countenance, and no countenance is not the Dao; Heaven is never without form, and no form is not Heaven. Then to be born of form is to die in form, to be born of countenance is to die in countenance—life and death may be forgotten, yet these have never departed from him.\n\nTo serve appearances with the Dao is to be a man of artifice. To serve life with appearances is to be a man of dissipation. To forget appearances through the Dao is merely to forget the Dao. The lame, the toe-less, the lipless, the goitered—even they do not lose their wholeness of virtue; how much less those who are not so afflicted? \"Forgetting what should not be forgotten\" and serving form is something people recognize as delusion. But if one \"does not forget what should not be forgotten,\" and form and countenance remain, this is how Heaven accomplishes, how accomplishment is made great—merging inner and outer, uniting the refined and the coarse, congealing the Dao and aligning with Heaven, so as not to lose what one has received.\n\nHow could the sage be one to nitpick over the trivialities of form and countenance? Alas! The folly of Duke Ling of Wei—seeing a lipless man and gazing at the full-necked as if they were mere shoulders. Alas! The folly of Duke Huan of Qi—seeing a goitered man and observing the full-necked as if they were mere shoulders. If these two rulers, with their towering caps and grand sashes, their high steps and raised brows, harbored ravines in their hearts and swords in their bellies, and had grasped this truth, they would have regarded the world’s most splendid appearances as though they were tainted with filth, fearing to distance themselves too late.\n\nThus, the token is the fullness of virtue; without virtue, there is no fullness, and without fullness, there is no token. Fullness without token is called a stolen token; virtue without fullness is called hollow fullness. Virtue that is not full is called declining virtue; fullness that does not match is called misaligned fullness. \"The Dao gives him his countenance\"—countenance mirrors the Dao; \"Heaven gives him his form\"—form repays Heaven.\n\nTo fuss over fame and reputation, repeatedly altering one’s Heaven-given form—why not inwardly preserve and outwardly remain unshaken, roaming within \"Yi’s drawn bow,\" so as not to lose one’s Heaven? Thus, his appearance is not the appearance of a man of appearances; his lack of appearance is not the lack of appearance of a man without appearance. To verify the token through virtue—no virtue is not a token; to align with virtue through the token—no token is not virtue. If one knows the world treats form and countenance as commodities but does not recognize them as tokens, how can one know virtue?\n\n*The Great Ancestral Master*\n\"Heel-breathing\" is the beginning of instruction, yet it encompasses the Way of the perfected person. \"The vastness of Heaven is One\"—there is no room for the human. From the heel upward, there is nothing that is not Heaven, nothing that is not the One, and yet it is already vast. \"Going against the few,\" \"the male’s completion,\" \"the counselor’s deliberation\"—all are \"throat-breathing.\" \"Delighting in life,\" \"detesting death,\" \"joy in emergence,\" \"resistance in retreat\"—all are \"throat-breathing.\" \"Joy in connecting with things,\" \"having kin,\" \"timeliness\"—all are \"throat-breathing.\" \"Punishment,\" \"ritual,\" \"knowledge,\" \"virtue\"—all are \"throat-breathing.\" \"Likes and dislikes\"—all are \"throat-breathing.\"\n\nDrawing it up to the heel: the few also go against, completion is also male, the scholar also deliberates, life is also delightful, death is also detestable, emergence is also joyful, retreat is also resistant, connecting with things is also joyful, kin are also present, timing is also Heaven, punishment is also embodied, ritual is also auxiliary, knowledge is also timely, virtue is also followed, likes are also liked, dislikes are also disliked. Those who die for fate do so without relying on the throat. Here, it is vast, immeasurable, inexhaustible—beyond achievement, beyond naming. It spans ten thousand years, embraces ten thousand things, yet is neither Heaven nor the One—who could surpass this?\n\nThe world loves depth but alone trivializes its Heavenly mechanism. Thus, it indulges in excessive punishments and extravagant rituals, outwardly admires virtue yet frequently employs knowledge, and forms cliques of likes and dislikes under the banner of righteousness—all to deepen its cravings. Below the throat, cravings occupy it, leaving only the throat to receive Heaven and immediately expel it. This is the common affliction of past and present, yet those who speak of the Dao cannot abandon it.\n\nHeaven is empty, thus it receives; Heaven is full, thus it selects. To receive and not be able to expel is neither Heaven nor the One—like choking in the chest, longing for a single release. To select and find it insufficient is neither Heaven nor the One—then one alters ruler and minister, inverts inner and outer, to prop up what one cannot reach, hoping for a swift response without shame.\n\nAlas! Those who know Heaven’s emptiness and Heaven’s fullness are few in ancient and modern times. If so, one does not seek it elsewhere: simply take what one breathes and draw it up to the heel—nothing is heard, nothing is lacking.",

Using desires to remedy desires, when these prove insufficient, one grasps at the Dao to sustain them—thus the world remains shallow, and Heaven loses its mechanism. Then Heaven, too, grows sorrowful.\n\nSealing the door to await another’s entry, yet none enters, Heaven becomes hollow. When Heaven grieves, nothing fails to grieve; thus one shudders and flickers, spending a lifetime as a throat, bearing cares that pierce even unto death. When Heaven is hollow, all it does is hollow; to clash with hollowness is never to find peace. Yet the world’s love of depth, and the suffering of attaining depth, are but shallowness in the end. Draw it to the heel—this is the utmost. Even if one reaches \"Vast Heaven’s Oneness,\" one cannot abandon this as a remedy.\n\n\"Assuming human form\" for a hundred years, one exhausts all within one’s store before knowing that Heaven’s Oneness is indeed vast. *Responding to Emperors and Kings*—the world has never departed from \"our origin,\" yet is startled by the multitude of things: laughing at one event, flinching at another, dazzled by this, fixated on that—believing this teeming world lies beyond our origin. Thus, thinking one can welcome it without loss, one \"hides benevolence to entice others\"; believing one can govern by having a master, one \"issues canons from oneself\"; believing one can exhaust it by embodying all, one \"wearies body and startles heart\" to meet the world’s demands. All this is to admire the sage’s achievement without knowing how it is achieved.\n\nThe world has never departed from our origin, yet it constantly fails to know this.

The Son of Heaven and the world are both children of Heaven—thus the world is no different.

The Dao is also virtue, virtue is also achievement, achievement is also fame, fame is also profit, profit is also desire, desire is also the Dao. The Dao does not depart from our origin; though there be worthy and wise, none can surpass it. Desires do not depart from our origin; though there be rebels and tyrants, none can deceive it. Not startling the world, one need not fear one’s own scarcity. With no scarcity in me, the world has no excess—without calling it \"one,\" one cannot.\n\n\"Hiding the world within the world,\" all is hidden within our origin. Naming it without becoming its corpse, scheming without becoming its storehouse, acting without becoming its burden, knowing without becoming its master; being its corpse without being named, its storehouse without scheming, its burden without acting, its master without knowing. Though one dam the floodwaters of a deluge or shoulder the fierce renown of banishment, emperors remain emperors, kings remain kings—never departing from our origin, why trouble oneself with carving?\n\n*Superfluous Toes*—what the body originally lacks, what use does not require, arising without cause, relying on it for security: gain brings joy, loss brings sorrow—this is what is meant by the undetachable superfluous growths. Not being Zeng or Shi yet imitating Zeng or Shi, not being the Yu clan yet imitating the Yu clan, not being Boyi yet imitating Boyi—these are \"color-seizing\" and \"forced growth.\" Regarding benevolence and righteousness as external and observing or listening to them, one fails to know the union or separation of name and reality. Hearing for oneself, one does not obscure its sound; seeing for oneself, one does not obscure its form. If benevolence and righteousness are indeed so, can one decide with five fingers and two palms? Can one gnaw at them? It is not merely hating tears and fearing wails.\n\nKnowing benevolence is not distant, knowing righteousness is internal, one flees one’s fate rather than fleeing benevolence and righteousness. Boyi starved without resentment—what wailing is there? What one hates in harming life and damaging nature is that it is followed by wails.\n\n*Horse Hooves*—without bit and bridle, what use is a horse? Without carving and crafting, what use is wood? Without becoming a sacrificial vessel, what use is unworked timber? Without becoming a ritual jade, what use is raw jade? Without adopting benevolence and righteousness, what use is the Dao? Those who \"stride and pry, competing for profit\"—this is the sage’s error, yet the sage bears it without refusal. Knowing the sage’s practice of the Dao, bearing error without refusal, how then can one repay the sage’s virtue without daring to obscure it?\n\n*Opening Chests*—the sage cannot be killed; the great thief cannot be stopped. Since the thief cannot be stopped, the sage indeed cannot be killed. Knowing the sage cannot be killed and the great thief cannot be stopped, one can only accept it with the Dao.",

Those who know Heaven’s emptiness and Heaven’s fullness are few in ancient and modern times. If so, one does not seek it elsewhere: simply take what one breathes and draw it up to the heel—nothing is heard, nothing is lacking.",

      "translated_text": "Still they crane their necks and lift their heels, pointing to worthies and sages as mere names while pursuing their own private gain—yet they would halt the thief. How rare that this does not breed great chaos! Knowing their profound unity, and thereby generating the Dao’s laws, the sage daily renews while the great thief daily recedes. Who then would brandish benevolence and righteousness as a \"thief’s reed pipe\"?\n\n**Embracing and Allowing**\nThe movements of the human heart may be known, or they may not. What cannot be known is the heart’s celestial nature. Those who govern the world invariably govern what can be known, never what cannot. Governing what can be known, they find the heart already stirred, then proceed to impose order upon it: they apply \"sagely wisdom\" to the cangue, \"benevolence and righteousness\" to the fetters, and the likes of Zengzi and Shi Yu to Jie and Zhi—never matching person to person but only clashing them together. To call this \"agitating the human heart\" would not be wrong.\n\nWhy is this so? Governing what can be known, they secure names to be born, laws to be enacted, and achievements to be displayed. Thus, they need not possess the reality of sagely wisdom, benevolence, righteousness, Zengzi, or Shi Yu, yet they may still proclaim to the world, \"We have governed it.\" As for what cannot be known—where there is no reality, how can there be a name? Where there is no image, how can there be a law? Where there is no failure, how can there be merit? The traces of name, law, and merit vanish, so those who flaunt their governance before the world do not engage with them.\n\nYet when the human heart has not yet arisen, there is nothing to agitate. To submit early to the unknowable is merely to govern the self. Be cautious in joy, and the world will not be licentious; be cautious in anger, and the world will not be predatory. When joy and anger guard their knowledge, the world does not run wild.\n\nThe source of utmost yang illuminates all things; the source of utmost yin conceals all things. Illuminating all things is not to illuminate things; concealing all things is not to conceal things. Each thing returns to its root, and its nature rights itself. Things inherently live, and their dispositions naturally unfold. Things do not know themselves, yet indifferently they halt their own excess and predation. This is the thoroughness of sagely wisdom, and how Zengzi and Shi Yu found their own tranquility. In finding tranquility, the world becomes tranquil.\n\nHeaven and earth are what the myriad things rely upon to settle themselves. \"Great and small, long and short, near and far\"—each has its completed measure. There is no other reason: one’s vision stops at the visible, and so one preserves it. Rejoicing in gain, raging at loss, clinging to completed forms while ignoring whether the world is so or not—this is the great malady of past and present.\n\nThe formless is not truly formless; one simply does not see it. Knowing that the formless has form and the shapeless has shape, even \"great and small, long and short, near and far\" can no longer be fixed—how much less the myriad things? The formless is about to take form; the shapeless is about to take shape. Stillness contains movement; movement lingers and gives birth to things. Things arise in an instant, yet their origins always precede them. One moment’s lingering, and form is complete.\n\nKnowing this, can one fail to guard stillness and listen for movement? Stillness without reliance ensures movement without exhaustion. Its movement is necessarily upright, its lingering necessarily fruitful, its birth necessarily harmonious. Heaven and earth’s generation of things and the sage’s initiation of affairs are one and the same.\n\nThough the heart may be hollowed out, it hollows only the heart that clings to fixed judgments, while something must remain within. \"Seeing clarity,\" \"hearing harmony,\" \"officiating heaven and earth,\" \"storing the myriad things\"—yet none can fathom it. Not that none can fathom it, but the world fathoms it only in terms of \"great and small, long and short, near and far.\" As for the formless all taking form, the shapeless all taking shape, each measuring itself and righting its own nature and destiny—none can fathom this.\n\nThe Dao of heaven, when empty, can be filled with anything; when still, it can move anything. To be fillable with anything, movable with anything—this is the union of heaven and humanity. \"Revolving without accumulation\" is called emptiness: the passage of past and present without amassing their dregs. \"Nothing in the myriad things suffices to disturb the heart\" is called stillness: following the forms and names of one’s joy and anger.\n\nEmptiness and stillness describe the state of abiding in virtue. They are not fleeing reality to attain emptiness or blocking movement to attain stillness. Fleeing emptiness and blocking movement, one flees all the more while things accumulate. \"Sticky and chaotic,\" daily disturbing the heart, vexed and seeking escape in death—death itself becomes a burden, leaving the dregs of emptiness and stillness to encumber later generations. Thus, beneath the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, the school of punishments and names arose, burdening endlessly.\n\nHow much more in the days of one’s life, anxiously struggling all day, competing with clamor, and harboring resentment? Within emptiness and stillness, heaven and earth advance, the myriad things flow through, and there is no greater joy. Those who embody this will clearly not clamorously set emptiness and stillness as a goal and disturb the heart in pursuit of it.\n\nThe workings of heaven’s transformation are subtle indeed!",

      "translated_text": "The marvel and vastness of transformation are profound indeed! The spirit-person, thus in heaven and earth, sun and moon, clouds and rain, wind and thunder—movement only brings forth more. Subtle is its mechanism, so those who seek its causes can never fathom it. Observing from its subtlety, one doubts whether there is any transformer at all; if no transformer exists, then \"nothing presides within,\" and how could it come to rest? Observing from its vastness, one doubts whether some wielder of control serves as its great overseer; if an overseer holds the power of control, then \"nothing is upright without,\" and it cannot be put into motion.\n\nThose in the world who apply their minds and employ things do not stray from these two extremes: some follow their fixed inclinations, others shift their intentions with things, both falling into the snares of \"great and small, long and short, cultivated and distant,\" yet none can escape. Neither extreme can be relied upon, and to abandon them in search of another path is only to grow more lost. Thus, one weighs the balance between inner and outer, embodying subtlety while employing vastness, using the center to裁 the outer—then the outer does not overflow; with emptiness at the center to receive the outer, the outer does not obstruct.\n\nThose who cultivate the mind and govern things—how could they not proceed thus?\n\nAll the world’s arts arise from preference. Preference gives rise to aversion, to sorrow, to joy, to delight, to anger. Clinging to what one prefers, one fails to consider even what is Dao though it lies before them. Failing to attain one’s preference brings worry; worry brings change, change brings conflict, and conflict inevitably leads to attachment, binding one’s interactions. When such bonds do not endure, they erupt and rush toward what was not preferred. Thus, though one may initially cling to preference within the Dao, in the end they cast the Dao aside as if forgotten—not only those who chase preferences in desires abandon the celestial mechanism.\n\nThough things may be preferred, one must know there is the Dao; though the Dao may be preferred, one must know there is essence. The Dao nurtures essence, not essence the Dao. Nothing in the world is prized but essence!

      "translated_text": "Within humanity lies nature; within heaven lies all that is fate. Once one is born human, one can master nature but not fate. What lies within humanity is all of heaven; what lies within the self is then human. Once one is established as a self, one can master the human but not heaven. The one who objectifies things knows that things are things and not nature. The one who is not objectified by things knows that things are not the self and does not accept their fate. Hunger, thirst, cold, heat, and the shackles of poverty—though unbearable—humans endure them, knowing them to be of heaven. The benefits of things, though one ought not to follow them, one follows, not knowing them to be of fate. Not knowing that things are of heaven and heaven is of fate, one then seeks what cannot be attained as if it could be attained—this is called the deluded mind. Humans cannot possess heaven; the self cannot possess things. Though one wishes to achieve success in what is right, one fundamentally cannot. To attempt achievement where one cannot is to grasp at the art of igniting fire in an empty sack—the world calls such a one a deluded person.\n\nTo be upright without reliance, not scheming for the worthy, not deceiving the unworthy, not seeking an end in sight, being cautious and circumspect in following what lies before one—this is the Way of the self that emerges from such a path, called \"between talent and lack of talent.\" It is not about maneuvering between talent and lack of talent to avoid harm. Tian Zifang was \"true\" but not \"entwined\"—this was not \"preservation\"; he was \"pure\" but cut off from \"things\"—this was not \"purity\"; he was \"crude in understanding human hearts\"—this was not \"illuminated in ritual and righteousness.\" Those who claim to be Confucians but are not true Confucians are many—they \"follow in steps\" but cannot \"leave the dust behind.\" They wait for the sun and moon to use their \"toes and eyes,\" yet they are those without toes and eyes. Toes have their purpose as toes, eyes have their purpose as eyes—what does not perish remains. By making night into day and day into night, preserving one’s spirit and clarity in \"discarding robes and sitting freely,\" then the world does not wait for eyes to see its brightness, does not wait for toes to emulate its movement, does not wait for words to dissolve its meaning.\n\nThe Way of the noble one has been spoken of this way many times—it is not only Zhuangzi who has said so. In *Knowing the Northern Journey*, \"blending ten thousand years into one pure whole\" is what makes unity precious. The multitude knows the instant, the wise know the season, those who establish resolve know the day, the self-examining know the month, the comprehensive know the year, the noble one knows the whole life, and the sage knows the pure. The more enduring their knowledge, the more they forget the petty. Alas! The night does not reach dawn, the morning does not reach dusk—seizing the moment to act, yet like fish in the flowing stream, flapping their fins and scales. Speaking only for fear of not exhausting words, acting only for fear of not reaching the utmost—taking this as diligence, as quickness, as subtlety. \"The morning mushroom knows not the dark and dawn, the cicada knows not spring and autumn\"—those who diminish their years to hasten toward death, this is called the death of the heart.\n\nGengsang Chu held to \"what cannot be held,\" using non-holding to hold without holding, and thus his \"cosmos was at peace.\" Holding to the \"spirit terrace,\" his peace was then settled. Only when the \"spirit terrace\" is like lightning does it emit the \"heavenly light.\" \"Heavenly light\" is heaven’s radiance illuminating our \"spirit terrace.\" The delusion of the multitude is that \"being real yet having nowhere to reside,\" they force a place for it; \"being long yet having no root or tip,\" they force a root or tip—this is like ice and frost. Thus their cosmos is not at peace, and they conceal their \"heavenly light.\" To be able to release ice and frost, to have nowhere to conceal and thus emit \"heavenly light\"—compared to others, this is worthy, what the Buddhists call \"samadhi giving rise to wisdom.\" Yet this is as far as it goes. When \"heavenly light\" shines upon the \"spirit terrace,\" one’s own light is concealed—thus \"heavenly light\" is what can illuminate others.\n\nWhen the formed is equal to the formless, \"heavenly light\" melts it like ice. When the formless takes form, \"heavenly light\" shines and one’s own light is concealed—face to face yet not recognizing each other, none can know. Holding \"what cannot be held,\" yet what holds remains. \"Using the formed to image the formless\" is not using the formless to break the formed. The formless is not nothing. Seek it in stillness, observe it in vastness—within the cosmos, there is no formless. \"Heavenly light\" shines and seizes our light, and thus we see form, see the formless—it cannot be held, yet it is not that the formless is inherently unholdable. The formed can be held, but the formless \"cannot be held\"; yet the formless \"cannot be held\" but is not nothing formless—thus it can fundamentally be held. The holding of Yao and Shun both revealed the form of the formless.\n\n\"When spring’s qi arises, a hundred grasses grow; when autumn’s proper moment arrives, ten thousand treasures mature\"—cultivating the formless to reveal its being, having no place yet being real, having no root or tip yet being long—none can resist it. How could this be what \"heavenly light\" can reveal? It is clear that the emission of \"heavenly light\" cannot be the ultimate vision.",

      "translated_text": "When Xu Wugui and Ze Yang exhausted human thought and speculation, they measured the Dao and said, \"No one acts\"; when they acknowledged that humans must have thought and speculation, they measured it and said, \"Something impels.\" Those who measure the Dao in the world have exhausted their words. Yet \"no one acts\" is unconvincing, and \"something impels\" is incoherent—yet things are indeed convincing and coherent. Knowing their convincingness, one does not question their coherence; knowing their coherence, one does not fret over their convincingness. A partial view cannot traverse a thousand miles—how much less can it grasp the great? If one must know it, then know it through the \"sage’s love for others.\" \"In loving others,\" why does it \"never end\"? One suspects \"something impels.\" \"In loving others, people give it a name, yet without being told, they do not know\"—one suspects \"no one acts.\" Yet \"no one acts,\" and it is done; \"something impels,\" yet there has never been one who impels. The sage’s benevolence is the heart-mind of heaven and earth, misty and unceasing, not claiming merit, not laboring for fame, not displaying virtue. This is heaven’s omen in the sage, the sage’s union with heaven.\n\nYet it is not that \"no one acts\" and thus leaves no trace, nor that \"something impels\" and thus steadfastly maintains its constancy. \"Not knowing how it is so\"—this is what people say of the sage. Yet the sage only appears so but is not truly so. Knowing how it is so, one may then be guided to \"not knowing how it is so.\" The sage’s relation to the Dao of heaven cannot be measured by human feelings, yet it is not unmeasurable. One cannot take the two exhausted extremes of \"no one acts\" and \"something impels\" and generalize them as \"not knowing how it is so.\" The heart-mind of heaven and earth is the benevolence of heaven and earth; the sage’s benevolence is the sage’s heart-mind.\n\nExternal things: \"External things cannot be relied upon\"—those who rely on them are bound by the suspended heart-mind. They may be swept away or die, grieve or lament, yet loyalty and filial piety do not depend on things. Though swept away, dead, grieving, or lamenting, their harmony is never scorched. If one exhausts oneself and demands of things, encountering their \"errant ways\" will bring \"great calamity.\" Thunderous rage erupts and dark fires wildly rise—these are the inevitable results of oneself and things \"rubbing against\" one another. Loyalty and filial piety that do not scorch their harmony—how could the Dao ever be exhausted?\n\nThus, when parched, one begs for \"the waters of the Western River\"—this is extravagance toward the greatness of things. Raising a pole to \"guard minnows and tadpoles\"—this is confinement to the smallness of things. \"Carrying\" and \"prizing\" them, one takes things as praise or blame. \"Knowing exhaustion\" yet \"spirit does not reach\"—this is being deluded by the dreams of things. To clash with the world over loyalty and filial piety, with a heart full yet \"blocking its own apertures\"—this is why those of fame and principle harbor resentment and are not at peace with the Dao. Knowing this, the Dao is settled within oneself and does not depend on things. Knives, saws, water, and fire—can one not traverse them? How could these be an affliction to loyalty and filial piety!",

      "translated_text": "The *Four Chapters on Yielding the Throne* are spurious texts, vulgar and contradictory, impossible to reconcile with the world. There is no greater affliction than \"practicing methods of governance,\" no deeper delusion than \"delighting in rumors upon hearing them,\" and no more pernicious harm than \"the disputers of the world taking pleasure in one another’s debates.\"\n\nThe sage recognizes that Heaven’s generation of oneself—what one walks in, what one is accustomed to—is nothing but fate, nothing but nature. Though one walks through life without attaining its end, one’s words may seem hesitant, but how could there be leisure to indulge in fame, chase after pleasure, or monopolize methods of governance to glorify oneself?\n\nThe Dao in the world is \"nowhere absent,\" yet one cannot exhaust its choices, nor keep pace with its unfolding. Even a lifetime spent in this pursuit cannot exhaust it—how then could there be leisure to trumpet one’s \"thread of literary refinement\"?\n\n*\"The* Poetry *expresses the will, the* Documents *narrates affairs, the* Rites *guides conduct, the* Music *harmonizes, the* Changes *illuminates yin and yang, and the* Spring and Autumn *defines names and duties.\"* The Dao is guidance; guidance is transmission. Transmitting what is already so, \"without transmitting its superfluous words,\" allows others to pour for themselves from the great vessel.\n\nThe great vessel is the shared instrument of the world. I have no desire to act as others’ teacher, yet the work of Heaven in my stead is complete. Thus, the *Spring and Autumn* is a book of punishments and rewards, \"discussing without debating\"—hence, \"without reward yet encouraging, without anger yet awe-inspiring.\"\n\nThe likes of Mo Di, Qin Guli, Song Jian, Yin Wen, Peng Meng, Tian Pian, Shen Dao, Guan Yin, Lao Dan, and Hui Shi—neither punishing nor rewarding—debate endlessly, becoming no more than \"the hollows of mountain forests’ fine trees, great trunks of a hundred spans,\" comparable to the unison of bamboo flutes.
