  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Perfection Upper Clarity Scripture of the Great Tenuity Emperor-Lord’s Stepping of the Celestial Net and Flying of the Earthly Register, Inscribed on Golden Tablets with Jade Characters**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Perfection Upper Clarity Scripture of the Great Tenuity Emperor-Lord’s Stepping of the Celestial Net and Flying of the Earthly Register, Inscribed on Golden Tablets with Jade Characters*. Also known as *The Jade Scripture of Stepping the Celestial Net and Flying the Six Registers*. Author unknown, approximately composed during the Eastern Jin or Southern Dynasties. One scroll. Base text from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, Proper Section I.\n\n---\n\nThe Black Stars are the hun-soul and po-soul of the Northern Dipper. When stepping the Celestial Net, first close the qi, circle left beyond the Seven Stars, and traverse three times above the Dipper’s hun and po. Only then may one ascend to Yang Brightness.\n\nIf you wish to spiritually step the Dipper with true efficacy, let the hun and po follow the Net’s guidance, winding and bending as you proceed, and you shall ascend to the Jade Hall.\n\nTo step the Three Terraces: follow the Jade Net with Yu’s Steps, close the qi, ascend to the Golden Net, traverse back and forth nine times, knock the teeth thrice, and circulate the qi. Then invoke the name of the Terrace, and your wishes shall follow your intent.\n- For matters of fields and land, invoke the Upper Terrace.\n- For official rank and emolument, invoke the Middle Terrace.\n- For gold and jade, invoke the Lower Terrace.\n\nThis method is to be practiced specifically on days of the Six Jia; it is not necessary to cultivate it constantly. The Upper Terrace is called *Void Essence*, the Middle Terrace *Sixfold Purity*, and the Lower Terrace *Curved Birth*—all are names.\n\nThe Most High’s method of flying among the Five Stars is used to seek and step the Water and Fire Five Stars, summoning them to descend, thereby attracting divine cloud chariots and feathered canopies, and ascending to the Great Void. This is the method of Gu Xizi.\n\nClose the qi and ascend the Net, swallowing saliva fifteen times. At each star’s position, place the left hand over the heart and invoke: *\"Flying Immortal\"*—these two words suffice. Before ascending the Net, first visualize the essence of the Five Stars within the Five Viscera. After each stepping of the Net, press and perform the method accordingly. After fourteen years, you shall ascend by dragon flight in broad daylight. The essentials are recorded on a foot of plain silk—this is the Net’s diagram.\n\nThe Later Sage-Lord’s writings to the Three Officials and Earth Spirits are to be worn when stepping the Net to fly as an immortal, ascending to the Emperor of Great Peace.\n\nThe Most High Jade Emperor’s talismans of the Seven Stars are to be written in cinnabar on the eight seasonal days. Wear one talisman on the head when practicing the stepping of the Net for immortality.\n\nThe *Hidden Writ of the Most High* is to be worn on the left when carrying the Jade Emperor’s talisman, and on the right when carrying the Jade Maiden’s talisman. All the above talismans are to be written in cinnabar.\n\nThe *Hidden Writ of the Most High* was once transmitted by the Great Tenuity Emperor-Lord to the Supreme Clarity Cavern Perfected Lord for stepping the Celestial Net, flying the Earthly Register, grasping the Mysterious Dipper, climbing the Star Chief, connecting with the Nine Perfected, riding the flying dragon, roaming the Three Destinies, floating through the Three Lives, securing the Three Treasures, escaping the Six Harms, concealing the Six Yin, entering the Six Terminations, pacifying the Celestial Flower, guarding the Extended Term, visualizing the Primordial Assistant, treading the Great Supporter, circulating through the Cinnabar Chamber, ascending to Wen Chang, revolving through the Nine Paths, and attaining the rank of the Nine Elders. After twenty years of practice, one receives the scripture and becomes an Upper Clarity Perfected Person.\n\nThe Highest Supreme Primordial Lord and the Eight Elder Lords of Upper Clarity descended to teach the twenty-nine Perfected of the Dark Continent, enabling them to ascend to the Terrace of Langfeng.\n\nThe Later Sage-Lord journeyed to the Golden Dawn Flower Gate of Upper Clarity and entrusted the scripture to the Azure Lad of the Square Vase Palace, commanding him to teach the recorded names of immortals. Those whose names are inscribed in jade in the Perfected Register shall, upon achieving the Dao, return the scripture to the chamber of the Square Vase. Only then may they receive the scripture and ascend to the Great Tenuity.\n\nOrdinary people perceive the Seven Stars as near, yet do not realize how distant stepping them truly is. Daoists may know that the Celestial Net can be stepped, but they do not know that the hun and po do not follow the body. It is not that the body does not lead the hun and po, but rather that the hun and po fear the majesty of the Seven Stars and dare not follow the body in ascent. Thus, the three hun are not gathered, the seven po scatter, and one merely steps the Net with an empty corpse while the spirits do not follow—truly a vain labor.\n\nIf you wish to step the Net, calm the mind and empty the heart, freeing yourself from sorrow and worry, and casting aside thoughts of glory and flavor. Then circle three times, ascend the stars, and begin the invocation, causing the two spirits of hun and po to pass together through the Numinous Pass. Suddenly, the body is released, and in an instant, one forgets all grandeur and purity. Thereafter, stepping becomes as if treading empty space. After one year, you shall repel misfortune; after two years, you shall repel weapons; after three years, you shall repel death; after four years, you shall become an Earth Immortal. A thousand harms and ten thousand evils—none shall dare to encroach. From this point onward, blessings and fortune shall be boundless. You shall command spirits and employ numina, ride flying dragons, receive the Sacred Mushroom from the Great Ultimate, and be attended by jade lads from the Jade Emperor. After thirty-four years of practice, you shall become an Upper Clarity Perfected Person.\n\nTo step the Net, do not cross transversely against the Net. The straight lines connecting the boundaries of the stars are called the *Net*. To violate the transverse Celestial Net is to sever the Celestial Dao—a great prohibition. When stepping the Net, do not tread upon the stars of the Perfected—a great taboo. Violating either of these requires removing the headscarf, bowing, and apologizing to the Net’s image.\n\nUse cloth nine feet in length and six feet in width to arrange the star positions upon it. Mark the stars with blue ink and the Net with red ink. Store it in a clean box, and when you wish to practice, burn incense and take it out. Seven Jade Maidens attend the scripture, and seven Jade Lads guard the stars.\n\nWhen walking the paths of the world, if you tread the same roads as common people through fields and furrows, the flying dust will alone disturb you, and you shall share the same filth—under such conditions, you may not step the Net. However, if you dwell in the world but travel by carriage without seeing bloodshed or corpses, you may step the Net. If you reside in mountains and forests, observe long fasts, sever ties with the human world, dwell in cliffs and seclusion, or practice grain avoidance, then the taboos of treading dusty paths do not apply.\n\nAvoid eating the meat of the six domestic animals and the five pungent vegetables. Always bathe and wear clean clothes, burn incense at the place of stepping the Net, and face the direction of the Northern Dipper, aligning your head accordingly.\n\nBathing refers to the beginning of stepping the Net; it is not necessary to bathe before each stepping. The essential point is to ensure that hands, feet, mouth, and face are thoroughly clean.\n\nIn overcast weather, the practice may be performed in a quiet chamber or upon one’s sleeping couch. Stepping the Net during daylight is especially superior to doing so at midnight, though in all cases, one should avoid being seen by others while performing the rite. The only requirements are to avoid passing through filth or stagnation and to maintain a focused mind.\n\nThe Most August Lord of the Grand Tenuity instructs the *Scripture on Stepping the Celestial Net*, meticulously following the supreme methods of the divine perfected. First, burn incense at the place of practice, then close the *qi* and circumambulate leftward three times around the exterior of the Dipper stars, beginning at *Yin Jing* and circling to *Yang Ming*. Upon completion, release the *qi* and only then may the feet tread upon the Seven Stars, with the body stepping toward *Yang Ming*.\n\nThereupon, face the *Yang Ming* star, close the *qi*, and silently invoke:\n*\"Great Constellation of Yang Ming, Dark Culmen of the Literary Florescence, may my hun and po together traverse the Celestial Net.\"*\nAfter the invocation, tread upon *Yang Ming* with the left foot, then advance the right foot to *Yin Jing*, and invoke:\n*\"Yin Jing, Northern Pivot, Supreme Jade Armillary, may my hun and po follow my body.\"*\nNext, tread upon *Xuan Ming* with the left foot and invoke:\n*\"Xuan Ming, Shaking Brilliance, Purple Tenuity’s Radiant Gate, may my hun and po together traverse the Jade Balance.\"*\nThen tread upon *Dan Yuan* with the right foot and invoke:\n*\"Dan Yuan, Purple Palace, Supreme Numinous Field, may my hun and po together cross the Divine Ford.\"*\nNext, tread upon *Bei Ji* with the left foot and invoke:\n*\"Bei Ji, Celestial Radiance, Revolving Dark Celestial Time, may my hun and po together reach the Dark Pass.\"*\nThen tread upon *Tian Guan* with the right foot, advance the left foot to align with the right, and release the breath. If one’s single breath does not suffice to complete the Net, one may release and re-close the *qi* at the *Dan Yuan* star.\n\nSoftly invoke:\n*\"Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth—five phases mutually propel. The Seven Stars gleam resplendent; the Celestial Net wields supreme might. The Auxiliary Stars guard flourishing; the Adjuvant Stars repel decline. The Nine Perfected of the Supreme, the Supreme Ultimate of the Grand Tenuity, the Three Treasuries of the Jade Emperors, the Three Venerables avert calamity. Heaven moves, Earth turns; hun and po follow one another. May I ascend as a flying immortal, my true radiance lingering. May my name enter the Golden Chamber, the Jade Gate open. Mounting the dragon, I ascend the void; sun and moon share their splendor. Roaming the Upper Clarity, ringing bells in jade-green robes, I seize lightning on the left and command thunder on the right. Ten thousand evils on earth dare not pursue; malevolent hearts gazing upon me are shattered and crushed. By the Emperor’s command, Jade Maidens attend my return. Hun, true soul, po, and spirit—unite in form to ascend and fly.\"*\n\nFor the reverse stepping method, halt at *Tian Guan*, turn to face *Bei Ji*, and softly invoke:\n*\"Supreme Primordial Time, Florid Canopy of Purple Numinosity, Jade Chamber of the Northern Culmen, concealing radiance and transforming essence. Grand Tenuity’s Dark Terrace, Nine Perfected’s Jade City—may I, as a flying immortal, traverse the Cloud Courts. Returning to step the Celestial Net, hun and po together live. Mounting the dragon to the Florid Palace, I attain the name of the Dao. On the left, I wear jade pendants; on the right, I gird golden bells. Tiger-sash and dragon-skirt, I whistle to command celestial soldiers. Riding the Three Pure Ones’ luminous essence, I ascend to the Upper Clarity.\"*\n\nAfter the invocation, close the *qi*, lift the left foot to tread upon *Bei Ji*, the right foot upon *Dan Yuan*. Next, lift the left foot to tread before *Xuan Ming*, align the right foot with the left, face the star of the Perfected, release the breath, and softly invoke:\n*\"Supreme Ultimate’s Nine Essences, Highest Perfected of the Primordial Sovereign—emerging to ascend the Primordial Clarity, entering to conceal in the Dark Yin. Nurturing my longevity, may I love immortality. The Jade Terrace suddenly opens; the Golden Hall’s eight gates—grant me the scripture to wear, crimson dragon and azure skirt. Above, assist the Purple Tenuity; later, the sagely lord. Riding ten flying dragons, dark canopy and luminous clouds, my name inscribed on the Primordial Chart, sun and moon conjoined.\"*\n\nAfter the invocation, close the *qi* again, tread upon the *Bi* star with the left foot, advance the right foot to *Yin Jing*, then advance the left foot before *Yang Ming*, align the right foot with the left, and release the breath. Softly invoke:\n*\"Celestial Constellation of Upright Yang, the Dipper’s revolving rise and fall. Turning the Primordial Mechanism before, moving the Numinous Net behind—restrain the po to pacify, constrain the hun to flourish. Hun and po with the body together traverse the Celestial Hall. Facing the Golden Portal, the Highest Supreme August One, the Immortal Mother on the right, the Immortal Father on the left. Purple and jade-green flying blossoms, dragon robes and tiger garments. Wearing the true scarf and jade, a halo born upon the neck. Hands grasping divine bells, waist girded with golden pendants. Mouth chanting the *Dongzhen*, sevenfold wondrous verses. First from emptiness and nonbeing, born to be king. Flying through the Nine Paths, grasping the Dipper and climbing the Net. Before following the Supreme Unity, behind following the Dark Gentleman. Imparting to me the oral formula, seated in disappearance, standing in vanishing. The essentials of reverse stepping—attaining the rank of Immortal Minister. The five viscera self-generate, greeting Heaven in accord. All wishes fulfilled, all prayers flourishing. Ten thousand evils submit in harm; shifting ground, they conceal. Those who hate me are punished by Heaven—drowned in water, perished in fire.\"*\n\nFor the reverse stepping method, close the *qi* again and circumambulate rightward three times around the exterior of the Dipper stars, beginning at *Yang Ming* and circling back to *Yang Ming*. Release the breath and invoke:\n*\"Highest Supreme Perfected, Seven Luminaries’ Most Venerable—reverse stepping to seek life, ascending to the Celestial Origin. May I, as a flying immortal, enter the Purple Gate.\"*\n\nThen close the *qi* again, tread upon *Yang Ming* with the left foot and *Yin Jing* with the right. First advance the right foot to tread upon *Xuan Ming*, the left foot upon *Dan Yuan*. Next, tread upon *Bei Ji* with the right foot and *Tian Guan* with the left. Advance the right foot to align with the left, release the breath, and invoke:\n*\"Sevenfold transformations reverse and revolve, ascending the Jade Asterisms. Six Records assist me; Three Nets align in stepping. The Jade Emperor glances left; the Highest Supreme gazes right. Teaching me to ride the stars, ascending the Dark Path—grant the boon of flying immortality, the blessing of undying destiny. Floating through the Upper Clarity, riding the Florid Three Pure Ones. Golden, azure, and jade-green skirts—entering and exiting the Nine Abodes. The Northern August One bows in greeting; the Southern Perfected acknowledges with thanks. My name inscribed on the Immortal Terrace—thousandfold transformations, myriad changes. Befriending the Sagely Lord, assisting the Great Peace. All wishes follow the heart; ten thousand affairs achieve fruition. Those who harbor evil against me—blade punishment, fire burial.\"*\n\nProceeding in sequence, reversing, and retracing—once the Three Paths are complete, raise both feet together onto the Yang Bright Star. With the right hand pressed to the heart and the left hand pointing to the Dark Obscurity Star, hold the breath for three cycles, knock the teeth three times seven, and swallow saliva three times nine. This is called \"Grasping the Dipper.\"\n\nSoftly intone the incantation:\n*\"Purple qi of Yang Bright, dark essence of Grand Simplicity,\nGolden Watchtower, Yellow Chamber—within dwells the Great Spirit.\nLeft hand grasps the Supreme August One; right hand holds the Lofty Perfected.\nDragon clasps emerald robes; flying brocade bears tiger patterns.\nJade talismans gird the waist; lotus crowns adorn the head.\nExiting into the Void, entering the Nonexistent—golden perfection, jade radiance.\nThe numinous sovereign, majestic and towering, is named Yang Bright.\nFeet tread crimson mist; mouth chants the Cavernous Chapters.\nGrant me the Hidden Scriptures, teach me the stepping of the Nets.\nCircling thrice, grasping the Dipper, I forget myself.\nLet me become a flying immortal, soaring beyond the Void.\nInscribe my name in the Upper Clarity; ride the dark dragon’s chariot.\nWherever my intent turns, all wishes follow.\nThe Three Venerables unite their power; soul and spirit commune within.\nDispatch the divine officials, jade maidens, and jade lads.\nThose who harbor evil against me—\nlet their forms be struck by lightning and wind,\ntheir treacherous schemes severed at the tongue,\nbanished to the Ten Directions.\"*\n\nThe incantation complete, focus the mind until suddenly all self is forgotten—lingering long before descending.\n\nWhen the \"Grasping the Dipper\" method is finished, raise both feet together onto the Yin Essence Star. With the left hand pressed to the heart and the right hand pointing to the Perfected Star, hold the breath for three cycles, knock the teeth three times, and swallow saliva three times. This is called \"Climbing the Culmen to Enter the Grand Tenuity.\"\n\nSoftly recite the charm:\n*\"Dark essence of Yin, flowery watchtower of the Gate of Life—\nwithin dwells the Jade Emperor, the Northern Culmen’s Most Revered.\nPhoenix-embroidered collar, dragon-green jade skirts,\ntiger-girded waist bells, mushroom-red crowns.\nNamed Yin Essence, the Supreme Lord of the Highest,\nyou bestow the Hidden Scriptures, teaching me to step the Seven Origins.\nClimbing the Culmen, ascending to wander the Numinous Pass,\nexternally restraining the seven po, internally governing the three hun.\nPo refined of worldly burdens; hun treasured as the womb-spirit.\nHun and po guard the body, ascending as immortals together.\nSoaring through the Upper Clarity, returning qi to rejuvenate the countenance.\nWherever I turn, all desires come effortlessly.\nThose who harbor evil against me—\nlet their forms perish before the Three Officials,\ntheir might subduing the Six Heavens,\ncommanding the host of spirits.\"*\n\nWhen the \"Climbing the Culmen\" method is finished, raise both feet together onto the Corrector Star, feet aligned toward the Perfected Star. Bow four times, then kneel, holding the breath for four cycles, knocking the teeth four times, and swallowing saliva four times. This is called \"Receiving the Perfected.\"\n\nFocus the mind, entering from the Culmen to ascend onto the Corrector Star—do not cross the Nets transversely. Kneeling, softly intone the incantation:\n*\"Nine essences of the Great Ultimate, luminous perfected of the Upper Origin,\ngrasping the balance of the primal mechanism, exhaling and inhaling purple mist.\nGolden light and jade radiance, majesty illuminating the Ten Heavens,\ncommanding the Three Luminaries, harmonizing yang and yin.\nGoverning the origin, bestowing qi, transforming the old into the new.\nAbove, ruling the Central Mansion; the mystery within the Mysterious Pass.\nGolden chambers, jade portals—four conveniences at the Northern Palace.\nExiting to ride the Eight Effulgences, floating through the Grand Origin.\nDragon-brocade, phoenix robes; tiger-green flying skirts.\nCrimson banners, green stoles; purple feathers with seven borders.\nGirded with divine talismans; crowned with supporting coronets.\nAbove, perching in the Nine Voids; below, soaring through celestial abysses.\nSelf-styled Jade Emperor, Ultimate Perfected of the Nine Heavens.\nPitying my devotion to the Dao, you bestow the Hidden Chapters.\nI ascend the Corrector and Culmen, paying homage to the Numinous Lord.\nBeseeching the cinnabar scriptures, the forerunner of life.\nLet me govern the Three Heavens, soar through the Eight Mysteries.\nThe five viscera self-generated, attaining the highest rank of flying immortals.\nBecoming the Jade Emperor’s winged attendant, minister to the Later Sages.\nRanked as Grand Master, riding clouds and flying wheels.\nAll wishes fulfilled; no demon dares approach.\nThose who harbor evil against me—\nlet their forms be exposed, their gates shattered.\"*\n\nWhen the \"Receiving the Perfected\" method is finished, raise both feet together onto the Dark Obscurity Star. With the right hand pressed to the heart and the left hand pointing to the Cinnabar Origin Star, hold the breath for three cycles, knock the teeth three times seven, and swallow saliva three times. This is called \"The Northern Dipper.\"\n\nSoftly intone the incantation:\n*\"Divine radiance of the Cavernous Heavens, concealed within Dark Obscurity,\nqi filling the Grand Void, coming and going without form.\nHidden in heaven, concealed in earth, pervading the unborn.\nSuddenly ascending the Celestial Nets, stepping the Purple Court.\nGazing north to the Thunder Chambers, south to the Lightning Cities.\nDazzling transformations—no longer the former form.\nVast and indistinct, flowing light—with a touch, instantly achieved.\nSeeking to conceal oneself—know my name.\nVoid and proud, ninefold Dark Obscurity.\nSitting and rising with the Six Jia, visiting and appointing the Six Ding.\nGrant me the Hidden Scriptures, stepping the Dipper and walking the stars.\nLooking up to the Supreme August One—\nrobed in cinnabar and azure, holding numinous radiance,\ngirded with jade bells.\nAbove, beseeching to become a flying immortal, born together with heaven.\nInscribe my name in the Grand Tenuity, floating through the Upper Clarity.\nBelow, beseeching transformations, concealing light and recording form.\nAll affairs as wished; all obstacles leveled.\nThose who harbor evil against me—\nlet them be slain by divine soldiers.\"*\n\nThe *Golden Root Text of the Great Ultimate Perfection* states:\n*\"When you ascend Dark Obscurity and step the Dipper to conceal your form,\nif you wish to transform, know my name.\nRevolving heaven and moving earth, all things instantly achieved.\"*\n\nWhen stepping Dark Obscurity or desiring concealment, focus the mind on this name.\n\nWhen the \"Stepping the Dipper\" method is finished, raise both feet together onto the Cinnabar Origin Star. With the left hand pressed to the heart and the right hand pointing to the Northern Culmen Star, hold the breath for three cycles, knock the teeth three times, and swallow saliva three times. This is called \"Treading the Records.\"\n\nSoftly intone the incantation:\n*\"Nine terraces of the Supreme, dark records of the Cinnabar Origin—\nexternally governing the Northern Pivot, internally rectifying celestial principles.\nGolden Watchtowers gleaming without; jade courts shining within.\nWithin dwells the Most Revered, named the Crimson Child,\nruling in the Cinnabar Origin, the Crimson Chamber’s midst.\nEmerald clouds, embroidered flowers; dragon stoles, tiger robes.\nRight hand holds the August Register; left hand grasps the Culmen’s Nets.\nFeet tread luminous clouds; head wrapped in purple coronets.\nRight side bears flowing bells; left side girded with jade chimes.\nGrant me the Hidden Scriptures, treading the Records in wandering.\nAbove, beseeching to become a flying immortal, riding the dark dragon’s chariot.\nInscribe my name on the Cinnabar Terrace, the Jade Hall of the Great Ultimate.\nWherever I turn, wherever I seek—blessings and emoluments come forth.\nThose who harbor evil against me—\nlet them perish, attended by divine officials, jade maidens, and jade lads.\"*\n\nOnce the treading of the Records is complete, then place both feet upon the North Star. With the right hand pressed to the heart and the left hand pointing to the Celestial Pivot star, hold the qi for three breaths, knock the teeth three times, and swallow the saliva three times—this is called \"Stepping the Nets.\"\n\nA whispered prayer follows:\n\"Above in the Great Subtlety, the Purple Canopy of the North Star,\nbelow dwells the Supreme Perfected, soaring beyond the Nine Exteriors.\nEmerald skirts take flight; golden bells and azure sashes,\na waist girded with jade radiance, dark clouds swirling thick.\nGrant me the Hidden Scriptures, ascending the Seven Qi,\nmounting the clear mists in play, meeting with the Perfected.\nI beseech to become a flying immortal, inscribing my name in the Cinnabar Chamber.\nWherever I turn, may my wishes be fulfilled—\nno calamity, no harm.\nThose who harbor evil against me—\nlet them suffer defeat.\"\n\nOnce the Stepping of the Nets is complete, then place both feet upon the Celestial Pivot star. With the right hand pressed to the heart and the left hand pointing to the Celestial Pivot, hold the qi for three breaths, knock the teeth three times, and swallow the saliva three times—this is called \"Riding the Dragon.\"\n\nA whispered prayer follows:\n\"Supreme Seven Poles, Purple Tenuity’s farthest star,\nPrecious Mystery’s Golden Chamber, beyond lies the Jade Gate.\nRevolving through the Nine Palaces, harmonizing the Celestial Pivot,\nwithin dwells the Revered Divinity, named the Purple Sovereign.\nBestow upon me the Hidden Scriptures, bearing me to ride the dragon,\nascending the Nine Heavens, descending to the Earth’s Origin.\nLuminous clouds and cinnabar chariots, dark splendor and emerald robes,\na waist girded with the Dragon’s Whip, a head wrapped in tiger-patterned silk.\nEncompassing the birth of the myriad things, instructing the flying immortals,\nfreeing me from the name of death, abiding with heaven and earth forever.\nRiding the dragon, pacing the Dipper—\nwherever I turn, may I receive favor.\nThose who harbor evil against me—\nlet wind-blades and fire consume them.\"\n\nOnce Riding the Dragon is complete, then place both feet upon the Assistant Star. Hold the qi for one breath, knock the teeth three times, and swallow the saliva once—this is called \"Wandering the Three Destinies,\" circling the Celestial Flower.\n\nA whispered prayer follows:\n\"Great Ultimate’s Assistant Star, essence nurtured in the Purple Pass,\nlife fostered in the Chamber of Destiny, treasures guarding spirit and soul.\nThe Golden Chamber opens again; I am granted audience with the Assistant Lord.\nGrant me the Hidden Scriptures, allowing me to wander and revolve,\ninscribing my name among the Sagely Emperors.\nA flying immortal of the Nine Heavens, crowned in gold and girded with the Perfected,\nentering and exiting the Grotto Gate.\"\n\nOnce Wandering the Three Destinies is complete, then turn and proceed to the Adjuvant Star. Place both feet upon it, hold the qi for one breath, knock the teeth three times, and swallow the saliva once—this is called \"Pacing the Three Yang,\" entering and exiting the Three Lives.\n\nA whispered prayer follows:\n\"Great Void’s Mud-Pill Palace, the Purple Palace’s Heavenly Honored,\nMysterious Void’s True Axis, forerunner of the Emperor.\nIn the Dao, the Jade Sovereign; in the body, the Mud-Pill.\nBalanced resonance quickens life; qi pierces the Empyrean’s Origin.\nEssence enters the Hall of Light, strengthening the embryo and augmenting the soul.\nThe Vermilion Mountain opens again; I draw near the Numinous Origin.\nTo the left, I gather the sun’s splendor; to the right, I pluck the moon’s root.\nFlowing fire ten thousand fathoms, golden gauze and azure skirts,\na waist girded with Heaven’s Bone, a head crowned with floral coronets.\nGrant me the Hidden Scriptures, allowing me to traverse the Celestial Pivot.\nI beseech to become a flying immortal, commanding the myriad spirits.\nWherever I turn, may all converge—\nblessings and virtue like mountains.\"\n\nAll actions are performed facing north, holding the scriptures. One may also follow the text while observing the stars, without reciting from memory.\n\nLater, the Sagely Lord received the Supreme’s *Stepping the Nets Hidden Scriptures* and transmitted them to the Azure Lad of the Square Cauldron. The Azure Lad passed them to Lord Wang, who secretly bestowed them upon those whose names were inscribed in the Jade Register of Bone Destinies. Those without their names in the immortal records may glimpse but not seek them, possess but not practice them. Not that they do not wish to practice—divine forces bar their ascent.\n\nAccording to the *Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles*, the Supreme’s Hidden Scriptures may be transmitted to only three persons within seven hundred years; beyond this, they may not be revealed again. When bestowing the scriptures, the recipient is first tested. Only after passing are they transmitted. The trials are not uniform, designed only to provoke their temper and discern their resolve through matters of granting or withholding. Thus did the Perfected of old examine their hearts to determine their will, observing their conduct to assess their deeds.\n\nBe subtle in speech during transmission.\n\nThe Yellow Supreme Master received from the Yellow Youth the method of *Stepping the Three Principles*, practiced its essential secrets, and swiftly ascended upon luminous clouds, journeying north to the Palace of Supreme Clarity. He entered and exited the Gate of Life, inhaling and exhaling the Void.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor received from the Xiangcheng Youth the method of *Stepping the Six Records*, practiced its essential secrets, and cast a tripod at Mount Jing, concealing his transformation at Qiaoling. He rode a dragon to the Dark Garden, mounting clouds to ascend the Towering Wind.\n\nGuangchengzi received from the Central Prime Youth of the Eastern Sea the method of *Stepping the Six Harms*, practiced its essential secrets, and rode the Tri-Subtle Clouds to the Boundless Wilderness. He harnessed eight flowery phoenixes and dragons, entered the Gate of Infinity, and traversed backward through the Great Void, attaining the rank of Jade Emperor.\n\nGong Zhongyang received from the Songgao Youth the method of *Stepping the Six Severances*, practiced its essential secrets, and ascended the Vermilion Radiance of the Cinnabar Mound. He rode the Dark Prime Chariot, drove ten flying cicadas, and roamed the Southern Darkness, with crimson clouds as his canopy, entering the Five Cities.\n\nThese four youths were all teachers of celestial perfection. The hidden scriptures they received and practiced were one and the same—only their names differed: *Three Principles*, *Six Records*, *Six Harms*, and *Six Severances*.\n\nIn spring, stepping the Seven Stars is called *Stepping the Three Principles*.\nIn summer, stepping the Seven Stars is called *Treading the Six Records*.\nIn autumn, stepping the Seven Stars is called *Walking the Six Harms*.\nIn winter, stepping the Seven Stars is called *Ascending the Six Severances*.\nPracticing these in secret, one floats and wanders in Supreme Clarity.\n\nMaster Wang said: \"In my time, I traversed the Zhou era, passed through the Warring States, wandered the strong Qin, and emerged in the great Han. I trod the earth’s sources, roamed the Nine Palaces, met various immortals, and questioned the perfected officials. When I first sought this Dao, all who stepped the Celestial Origin and practiced the Records and Principles attained the Way swiftly and without difficulty.\n\nThus:\n- Bei Yi stepped the Principles, and the Seven Essences descended to roam below.\n- Nie Que stepped the Principles and ascended to the Heavenly Hall.\n- Wang Ni stepped the Principles and rode clouds to the Ten Heavens.\n- The Yellow Emperor stepped the Principles, and his essence became the Xuanyuan.\n- Xu You stepped the Principles, and phoenixes flocked around him.\n- Chaofu stepped the Principles and ascended to attend the Heavenly Emperor.\n- Zhili stepped the Principles and dwelled in the Towering Wind.\n- Hua Feng stepped the Principles, and his body generated dark clouds.\n- Zizhou stepped the Principles and wore robes of green dragon and tiger.\n- Shanjuan stepped the Principles and rode a swift dragon torch.\n- Shihu stepped the Principles and flew to Yingzhou.\n- The Northern Man stepped the Principles, and jade maidens came to roam with him.\n- Pu Yi stepped the Principles and entered the Northern Dipper.\n- Master An stepped the Principles, and a red dragon bore him.\n- Huan Cheng stepped the Principles, met Wen Shi, gained a companion, and returned west with the Half-Chariot Youth.\n- The Two Women stepped the Principles, washed in white waters, met the Metal Mother, and dwelled on the Eastern Steps.\n- Bian Sui stepped the Principles and rode a dragon to the Grand Clarity.\n- Wu Guang stepped the Principles and transcended to the Purple Court.\n- Ma Huang stepped the Principles, and dragons and clouds arrived together.\n- Peng Zu stepped the Principles and journeyed to the Flowing Sands.\n- Lao Dan stepped the Principles, was hailed as the Sage Master, and the Pass Keeper received his teachings; together they ascended the Cloud Terrace.\n- Jiaojian stepped the Principles, rode a dragon to chase the stars, cast aside his fishing rod, and forever became an Upper Perfected.\n- Da Xiang stepped the Principles, and his complexion reverted to that of an infant.\n- The First Qin Emperor stepped the Principles, and a divine dragon spat forth a talisman.\n- Juanzi stepped the Principles, and the river yielded a spirit fish. He drank the Jade Liquid and ascended to the Dark Continent.\n- Xiao Shi stepped the Principles, recluded in the Qin Tower. Nongyu received his teachings, and together they reached the Green Mound.\n- Jieyu stepped the Principles, and husband and wife both became immortals. He governed Mount Emei and was enfeoffed over mountains and rivers.\n- Bohun stepped the Principles and was ranked among the Water Spirits.\n- Geng Sang stepped the Principles and roamed the Eight Darknesses.\n\nAll required this art for the essential Dao to be accomplished. Thus, I roughly record these figures to inform you. Some toiled first and later rested; those who underwent trials and did not falter also became earthbound immortals, attained the body of corpse liberation, or became lords of the underworld—numbering in the thousands. I cannot record all their names.\n\nAccording to the *True Statutes of the Four Poles*, those who achieve corpse liberation or become underworld lords must wait one hundred forty years to be appointed as immortal officials, then another one thousand three hundred years to be appointed as perfected officials. Only then may they ride flowery canopies, harness many dragons, ascend the Great Ultimate, and roam the Nine Palaces.\n\nDiligently follow the methods and practice them—none will fail to attain immortality. With focused heart and earnest sincerity, it takes but fourteen years. Then the essence of the Seven Stars will descend, transforming into divine beings. Together they will ride the Flowing Chimes and Eight Effulgences, their cinnabar and dark clouds arrayed, all coming to you. They will bow to you as an immortal official, bestow upon you the true talismans, and with the Dao accomplished, ascend to Supreme Clarity and the Palace of the Grand Tenuity.\n\nStrive and be diligent—all you seek will be realized. Why be lazy and become a lord of the underworld in the Dark Yin, waiting another one hundred forty years before ascending? I, too, attained this through diligence.\n\nOn the days of stepping the Principles, practice for seven days each month: the first, fifth, ninth, fifteenth, twentieth, twenty-fifth, and twenty-ninth days. If stepping at night, do so at midnight; if by day, at noon. If in a secluded place, practicing at noon in the courtyard is auspicious—only avoid being seen by the vulgar. If they witness it, the celestial essence will not descend.\n\nWhen the Dipper’s handle aligns with the first month (yin), the lunar establishment is in yin. At dark dusk, the Celestial Pass faces yin; at dawn, it faces shen; at noon, it faces hai. Simply follow the lunar establishment of the Dipper to calculate day and night, always knowing its position, and align with the diagram accordingly.\n\nIf you encounter malevolent ghosts or wicked people, visualize the Dipper’s stars pointing at them, hold your breath, and silently recite: *'I am the Heavenly Eye, moving with Heaven. My gaze is like lightning, illuminating the eight directions. I see through all, inside and out—nothing disobeys me.'* Thus, all treacherous and malevolent ghosts, all calamities and misfortunes, will not dare to approach you.\n\nOn jiazi days and the eight solar terms, stepping the Principles will attain immortality and summon the Seven Stars to you.\"\n\nThose who practice the Stepping of the Principles must not sleep at dusk on winter jiazi days, lest the radiance of the Seven Stars obscure their eyesight.\n\nThe method for stepping the Principles to shed one’s death-name and inscribe it upon the Jade Register employs the following days: the third day of the first month, the eleventh day of the second month, the nineteenth day of the third month, the eighth day of the fourth month, the fifth day of the fifth month, the ninth day of the sixth month, the seventh day of the seventh month, the fourth day of the eighth month, the ninth day of the ninth month, the fifth day of the tenth month, the eighth day of the eleventh month, and the twelfth day of the twelfth month. Stepping the Principles on these days will erase the record of death from the Palace of Fangzhu and the Terrace of Na, inscribing instead the character for \"life.\"\n\nIn the first month, one may step the Principles seven times, following the usual method. If sudden emergencies or misfortunes such as illness arise, one may step the Principles at once without waiting for an auspicious day. Whatever is spoken or invoked must be done with intent. First recite the established text in full, then state one’s personal wishes—both will take immediate effect, swifter than water or fire.\n\nFor women stepping the Principles, the image of the Principles is made of crimson silk; for men, it is made of cloth. The *Supreme Hidden Writ in Gold Tablets and Jade Characters* is the essential scripture for stepping the Celestial Principles, soaring through the Earthly Traces, ascending to the Supreme Clarity, and entering the Purple Tenuity.\n\nThe Supreme Lord always dispatches seven Divine Lads of the Western Numinosity, their faces adorned with jade blossoms, to attend the image of the Seven Stars. When stepping the Principles, these lads ascend the stars alongside the practitioner. Beginners do not see them at first, but after one year, they will often dream of these seven lads by their side, and within three years, their forms will appear before them. They wear flying topknots, dark-yellow and azure robes, and hold ointments of rosy clouds and incense, with vermilion lamps.\n\nThe Supreme Lord also dispatches the Southern Perfected Numinous Consort and the Purple Numinous Proud Maidens, their faces adorned with golden and azure dragon blossoms, to attend this hidden writ. When stepping the Principles, these divine maidens ascend the stars alongside the practitioner. Beginners do not see them at first, but after one year, they will often dream of these seven maidens by their side, and within three years, their forms will appear before them. They wear flying side-knots, cinnabar and azure robes, and hold black unguents from the Clothing Spring, sun-bright incense, and lamps. One must fast and purify for seven days before transmitting this scripture, and the recipient must do the same.\n\nAccording to the *Supreme Four Limits of Luminous Regulations*, this scripture may be transmitted only once every hundred years. Within seven hundred years, each master may transmit it to no more than three disciples. Beyond this number, it may not be further transmitted. Transmission must be preceded by purification rites, oaths of alliance, and vows of secrecy. The master must examine the disciple’s heart, probe their depth, assess their sincerity, and weigh their goodness or wickedness before entrusting the scripture to them. If one’s bone destiny is not aligned, they will not receive this writ.\n\nIf a mere walking corpse or one with a fair exterior but corrupt nature attempts to test the scripture without awakening, they may incur enmity, suffer injury or death, or disrupt harmony in life. Such individuals are not true disciples of the Dao and will meet with misfortune to halt their progress. Do not explain the reason. The Seven Celestial Lords of Numinosity, great spirits of the Dao and virtue, observe honor and disgrace and bestow corresponding blessings—do not worry.\n\nThis is the ultimate truth and the method of later sages, sufficient to gauge those with intent and to recognize those without ability. If you perceive the trials, you must first bow and offer thanks to the spirits of the Seven Stars to rectify your errors.\n\nThe Eight Endowments Formula states:\nIt is not the pursuit of immortality that is difficult, but finding the right person.\nIt is not the study of the Dao that is difficult, but receiving its scriptures.\nIt is not receiving the scriptures that is difficult, but passing the trials without realizing it.\nIt is not the trials themselves that are difficult, but practicing the scriptures with utmost sincerity.\n\nThe Supreme Lord’s secret words are wondrous and true.\n\nThe Supreme Lord’s Purple Writ, as recorded by Perfected Lord Wang, states in the *Azure Essentials and Purple Writ*: \"If you wish to ascend to Heaven, you must practice the Seven Numinosities. Having ascended the Northern Culmen, you will enter the Purple Court. Do not transmit this to the unworthy; first test their disposition.\" This is the proper discourse on stepping the Principles.\n\nWhen I first received the divine scripture, someone tested me by striking my hand with a staff for no reason, drawing blood. I still turned my heart toward them, my thoughts unwavering—this was the trial I had to pass. I then obtained this scripture, and was told, \"Yesterday, you traversed water and fire and emerged unscathed.\" At first, I did not understand these words, but later realized the trial was the striking of my hand.\n\nOnce, I transmitted the divine scripture to someone, and the method included a trial of casting them into peril. Before transmission, I suddenly set fire to their clothes. Their garments burned away, yet they said nothing, and their expression showed no great fear. Though their demeanor did not betray wickedness, and no evil words escaped their lips, they had passed the trial. I later transmitted to them the hidden scripture of stepping the Principles.\n\nThrough its practice, they attained the Dao and ascended to the Supreme Ultimate. There, they saw an inscription on the northern wall of the Supreme Ultimate, which read: \"Mao Ying of Xianyang received the scripture of stepping the Principles. His master tested him by burning his clothes. Though he did not speak, his expression was unsettled. This was a minor flaw, not true purity. He may traverse the Supreme Ultimate but must not ascend to the Supreme Clarity.\"\n\nUpon reading the inscription, Mao Ying was dismayed. Reflecting on his trial since receiving the scripture, he realized he had not perceived the flaw of his unsettled expression and qi. Ninety-eight years had passed, and he now understood that the mysterious mirror of the Celestial Principles records even the smallest details. He then redoubled his efforts, vowing to the Supreme Perfected Ones, and was finally appointed a minister of the Imperial Sovereign.\n\nTake heed of this, for Perfected Lord Wang has imparted these words to the Lesser Perfected Lord.\n\nThe *Jade Essence Hidden Writ and True Formula* beckons the hidden mushrooms of the Supreme Ultimate, adorned with kingfisher plumes and flowered robes, purple embroidered feathered capes, and cinnabar and azure flying skirts. The numinous mountains of the Five Peaks, the Six Origins and Seven Mysteries, the Perfected Ones of the Earth, and the wandering immortals each present their tribute and submit memorials to the Palace of the Supreme Tenuity.\n\nTo achieve this, there are essential methods; to obtain it, there are proper techniques. Mastering its secrets, one is appointed as an Immortal Duke.\n\nThe *Supreme Hidden Writ* states: On the first day of the first month, the twentieth day of the second month, and the twenty-seventh day of the third month, having completed the pacing of the celestial guidelines, align the body within the Dipper’s *Kui* asterism, face east, and visualize the Jupiter’s stellar essence within the liver. Bow twice, kneel, and pray:\n*\"Primordial Spirit of the Great Year, Wood Duke of the Nine Heavens, Radiant Yang and Mysterious Origin, all enter this body.\"*\nAfter the prayer, click the teeth nine times. Practicing this for fourteen years, the Lord of the Eastern Peak presents a robe of azure feathers, and the Perfected One of the Eastern Pole commands the Mysterious Origin Earth Spirits and the numinous mountains to deliver the raiment of the Supreme Clarity—verdant plumes and flowered skirts.\n\nThe *Supreme Hidden Writ* states: On the eighth day of the fourth month, the fifth day of the fifth month, and the eighteenth day of the sixth month, having completed the pacing of the celestial guidelines, align the body within the Dipper’s *Kui*, face south, and visualize Mars’ stellar essence within the heart. Bow twice, kneel, and pray:\n*\"Southern Supreme Spirit of the Upper Origin, Fiery Yang of Four Lights, Vermilion Waters of Zhongli, enter the cinnabar chamber.\"*\nAfter the prayer, click the teeth nine times. Practicing this for fourteen years, the Lord of the Southern Peak presents flying feathers, and the Perfected One of the Southern Pole commands the Mysterious Origin Earth Spirits and the numinous mountains to deliver the raiment of the Supreme Clarity—a purple-embroidered feathered cape.\n\nThe *Supreme Hidden Writ* states: On the seventh day of the seventh month, the twentieth day of the eighth month, and the ninth day of the ninth month, having completed the pacing of the celestial guidelines, align the body within the Dipper’s *Kui*, face west, and visualize Venus’ stellar essence within the lungs. Bow twice, kneel, and pray:\n*\"Western Supreme Mystery, Golden Essence of Seven Paths, Jade Origin of the Two Emperors, qi returns to the fetal brain.\"*\nAfter the prayer, click the teeth nine times. Practicing this for fourteen years, the Lord of the Western Peak presents a curved morning-flight canopy, and the Perfected One of the Western Pole commands the Mysterious Origin Earth Spirits and the numinous mountains to deliver the raiment of the Supreme Clarity—cinnabar and azure flying skirts.\n\nThe *Supreme Hidden Writ* states: On the fifth day of the tenth month, the third day of the eleventh month, and the sixth day of the twelfth month, having completed the pacing of the celestial guidelines, align the body within the *Kui*, face north, and visualize Mercury’s stellar essence within the kidneys. Bow twice, kneel, and pray:\n*\"Northern Mysterious Purple Dawn, Golden Chariot and Water Origin, Dragon Embryo transforming into spirit, enter this body.\"*\nAfter the prayer, click the teeth nine times. Practicing this for fourteen years, the Lord of the Northern Peak presents a dragon robe and tiger belt, and the Perfected One of the Northern Pole commands the Mysterious Origin Earth Spirits and the numinous mountains to deliver the raiment of the Supreme Clarity—a phoenix-brocade dark kerchief and a lotus-essence purple crown.\n\nThus, by paying homage to the Four Poles and invoking the ethereal essences of the Four Stars, praying to the hidden names of the Four Origins, one obtains the feathered capes for wandering in the Supreme Clarity.\n\nThe *Outer Scripture* states: \"Wings fully formed\" does not mean the body grows feathers. Rather, by ascending the celestial guidelines, preserving the *Kui*’s true essence, bowing to the spirits of the Five Essences, and praying to the names of the Four Origins, one elicits numinous offerings to ascend to the Supreme Clarity. Thus, the feathered robes descend from the mysterious, truly through the power of sincerity.\n\nThe *Supreme Hidden Writ* states: On every *jiazi* day and the eight solar terms, having completed the pacing of the celestial guidelines, align the body behind the *Bi* star within the *Kui*, face the Perfected Star, and visualize Saturn’s stellar essence within the spleen. Bow twice, kneel, and pray:\n*\"Nine Perfected Ones of the Supreme Ultimate, Flowing Prosperity of the Yin Root, Flying Unity and Retreating Canopy, enter the Muddy Pellet.\"*\nAfter the prayer, click the teeth nine times. Practicing this for fourteen years, the Lord of the Central Peak presents a jade pendant, golden earrings, a white-feathered canopy, and a purple cover. The Perfected One of the Supreme Ultimate commands the Three Mysteries Grotto-Heavens, Yang Terrace Celestial Realm, Commissioned Feather Numinous Prefecture, Nine Doubts Mysterious Divine Mound, and the Red Flaming Three Terraces to deliver the Golden Perfected Jade Radiance and the Supreme Ultimate Hidden Mushrooms.\n\nThe Supreme Ultimate Hidden Mushrooms have four varieties. One kind has four directional colors, its light illuminating a hundred paces like the moon. Another is azure, resembling stacked bright mirrors, each face about five or six *cun* in diameter, its light penetrating and clear, three layers stacked, six or seven *cun* high. It is called the *Supreme Ultimate Numinous Mirror Hidden Heavenly Azure Mushroom*. Another is white, resembling a sturdy Dipper star, with seven nodes marked by stars and stems as guidelines, over three or four *chi* tall, its light bright and penetrating. It is called the *Supreme Ultimate Mysterious Node Hidden Stellar Spirit Mushroom*. Another is crimson, like a small jujube tree, its fruit ring-shaped, its light brilliant and radiant, three or four *chi* tall. It is called the *Ring Guideline Hidden Mysterious Supreme Ultimate Golden Heaven Mushroom*. Striking its branches produces sounds like jade and gold. Another is dark green, resembling an overturned canopy on the ground, sometimes layered and stacked, about seven or eight *cun* in circumference, its pure light flowing like a candle, three or four *cun* high. It is called the *Supreme Ultimate Mysterious Moon Reclining Dragon Mushroom*.\n\nThese are the names of the Supreme Ultimate Hidden Mushrooms. Through sincere seeking and supplication, the Three Mysteries’ divine Perfected Ones all bestow them upon you. They may appear in marshes, unusual places, mountains, hills, or dwellings. Wherever they manifest, the Perfected Ones grant them to you. Consuming them, the Supreme Tenuity dispatches envoys to appoint you as an Immortal Duke, allowing you to multiply your forms ten thousandfold and your body to emanate jade-like radiance.\n\nThe *Supreme Hidden Writ of Pacing the Celestial Guidelines and Flying the Six Records Jade Scripture* was later requested by the Sage Lords and bestowed upon the Azure Lad of the Square Cauldron Palace, who transmitted it to those destined for immortality by bone and fate. Even those without their names in the immortal registers or jade books of the Dao may, by chance, encounter this jade scripture.\n\nThe statutes of the Perfected Ones of the Four Poles permit its transmission only thrice within seven hundred years, each transmission requiring oaths, written covenants on precious silk, and strict confidentiality to honor the supreme numinous. The scripture is strictly forbidden from mingling with other texts.\n\nFor those receiving the secrets of pacing the Seven Origins’ planetary stars, oaths must be sworn on thirty-two *chi* of silk, corresponding to the numbers one, five, and seven. For those receiving the secrets of pacing the Five Stars, oaths must be sworn on a golden dragon and jade fish, corresponding to the numbers two, four, and six.\n\nThis system follows the subtle configurations and precise divisions of the celestial patterns, hence the necessity of binding oaths. Since golden dragons and jade fish are nonexistent in the world, one must not withhold the scripture while awaiting such rare tokens. Instead, thirty *chi* of blue cloth may serve as the standard for this oath, demonstrating its beginning and end and manifesting one’s sincerity and reverence. This offering shall be presented to the master who holds the scripture, and the master in turn must distribute it without hoarding for personal gain. Violating the covenant incurs the judgment of the Three Officials, a matter of no small consequence. The Perfected Ones esteem blue as the token of trust and gold as the symbol of sincerity; whenever oaths are sworn, these are invoked as proof.\n\nThose who breach the statutes or leak the secrets commit grave offenses, extending punishment to their grandparents and subjecting them to the torments of hell. The objects of oaths must always be placed in the highest regard and never disclosed to others.\n\nThe *Three Charts of the Celestial Pass* state:\n*\"Cultivate the root with essence,\nAwaken the heart with balance,\nUnite the origin with sincerity—\nAll endeavors shall flourish.\nThe Perfected Ones treasure covenants,\nCherish gold and revere blue.\nHarmonize with incantations,\nPoint to them as pledges—\nThis oath is mighty;\nDo not violate or take it lightly.\"*\n\nEach transmission of oaths is bound by numerical limits. Those who, without proper transmission, recklessly reveal the titles of scripture passages commit the offense of leakage. The Jade Lads and Jade Maidens shall report to the Most High; after three such violations, one’s name reappears in the registers of death, and immortality is forever forfeited.\n\nAll transmissions must adhere to the covenant, and the recipient must return the gold and blue cloth to the master as an encouragement of merit and virtue. The Most High’s *Jade Scripture* and hidden writings are all stored in separate cases. When practicing or consulting them, one must burn incense, with Jade Lads and Jade Maidens standing guard on either side—do not assume their absence merely because they are unseen.\n\nThe numinous mirror of the Perfected Ones, descending from the Supreme Void, scrutinizes even the most minute intentions. How could one fail to be vigilant?\n\nIn the world, there also exists the method of *Pacing the Celestial Net and Treading the Earthly Records*. During the first year of the Yangshuo era, Wang Feng, the Grand Marshal of Emperor Cheng of Han, heard that the Daoist Liu Jing had studied immortality under Zhang Jun of Handan and obtained the method of *Pacing the Celestial Net*. Feng pressured him with authority and rank, and Jing, unable to refuse, secretly compiled an abridged version to give him. Feng regarded it as the key to longevity and wealth, practicing it in utmost secrecy and transmitting it within his clan. Thus, its invocations often employed terms of wealth, rank, and emolument, utilizing the days of *Heavenly Granary* and *Heavenly Treasury* for their conjunctions.\n\nThe emergence of this abridgment began with Liu Jing. By the end of the Han, he also showed it to Huangfu Long, who likewise revered and practiced it. Yet such superficial teachings—how could they move heaven and earth or stir the divine Perfected Ones?\n\nWang Se, a disciple of Feng, was enfeoffed as a marquis during Wang Mang’s reign. He claimed the *Scripture of Pacing the Celestial Net* was a celestial omen, casting it onto golden tablets and presenting it to Mang. What limit could there be to the benefits of *Pacing the Celestial Net*? Yet without seeing the true original text and its essential instructions, one already gains boundless advantage—how much more so if one attains its root?\n\nThe abridged method spread widely through the world, originating with Liu Jing and persisting to this day. As for the *Great Secrets of the Most High’s Jade Scripture on Flying Records and Pacing the Earthly Net*, Jing treasured and concealed them, and none knew to whom he transmitted them.\n\n*The Scripture of the Golden Tablets and Jade Characters on Pacing the Celestial Net and Flying the Earthly Records of the Supreme Lord of the Great Mystery of Highest Clarity*...",

      "translated_text": "**The Supreme Perfection Upper Clarity Scripture of the Great Tenuity Emperor-Lord’s Stepping of the Celestial Net and Flying of the Earthly Register, Inscribed on Golden Tablets with Jade Characters**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Perfection Upper Clarity Scripture of the Great Tenuity Emperor-Lord’s Stepping of the Celestial Net and Flying of the Earthly Register, Inscribed on Golden Tablets with Jade Characters*. Also known as *The Jade Scripture of Stepping the Celestial Net and Flying the Six Registers*. Author unknown, approximately composed during the Eastern Jin or Southern Dynasties. One scroll. Base text from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, Proper Section I.\n\n---\n\nThe Black Stars are the hun-soul and po-soul of the Northern Dipper. When stepping the Celestial Net, first close the qi, circle left beyond the Seven Stars, and traverse three times above the Dipper’s hun and po. Only then may one ascend to Yang Brightness.\n\nIf you wish to spiritually step the Dipper with true efficacy, let the hun and po follow the Net’s guidance, winding and bending as you proceed, and you shall ascend to the Jade Hall.\n\nTo step the Three Terraces: follow the Jade Net with Yu’s Steps, close the qi, ascend to the Golden Net, traverse back and forth nine times, knock the teeth thrice, and circulate the qi. Then invoke the name of the Terrace, and your wishes shall follow your intent.\n- For matters of fields and land, invoke the Upper Terrace.\n- For official rank and emolument, invoke the Middle Terrace.\n- For gold and jade, invoke the Lower Terrace.\n\nThis method is to be practiced specifically on days of the Six Jia; it is not necessary to cultivate it constantly. The Upper Terrace is called *Void Essence*, the Middle Terrace *Sixfold Purity*, and the Lower Terrace *Curved Birth*—all are names.\n\nThe Most High’s method of flying among the Five Stars is used to seek and step the Water and Fire Five Stars, summoning them to descend, thereby attracting divine cloud chariots and feathered canopies, and ascending to the Great Void. This is the method of Gu Xizi.\n\nClose the qi and ascend the Net, swallowing saliva fifteen times. At each star’s position, place the left hand over the heart and invoke: *\"Flying Immortal\"*—these two words suffice. Before ascending the Net, first visualize the essence of the Five Stars within the Five Viscera. After each stepping of the Net, press and perform the method accordingly. After fourteen years, you shall ascend by dragon flight in broad daylight. The essentials are recorded on a foot of plain silk—this is the Net’s diagram.\n\nThe Later Sage-Lord’s writings to the Three Officials and Earth Spirits are to be worn when stepping the Net to fly as an immortal, ascending to the Emperor of Great Peace.\n\nThe Most High Jade Emperor’s talismans of the Seven Stars are to be written in cinnabar on the eight seasonal days. Wear one talisman on the head when practicing the stepping of the Net for immortality.\n\nThe *Hidden Writ of the Most High* is to be worn on the left when carrying the Jade Emperor’s talisman, and on the right when carrying the Jade Maiden’s talisman. All the above talismans are to be written in cinnabar.\n\nThe *Hidden Writ of the Most High* was once transmitted by the Great Tenuity Emperor-Lord to the Supreme Clarity Cavern Perfected Lord for stepping the Celestial Net, flying the Earthly Register, grasping the Mysterious Dipper, climbing the Star Chief, connecting with the Nine Perfected, riding the flying dragon, roaming the Three Destinies, floating through the Three Lives, securing the Three Treasures, escaping the Six Harms, concealing the Six Yin, entering the Six Terminations, pacifying the Celestial Flower, guarding the Extended Term, visualizing the Primordial Assistant, treading the Great Supporter, circulating through the Cinnabar Chamber, ascending to Wen Chang, revolving through the Nine Paths, and attaining the rank of the Nine Elders. After twenty years of practice, one receives the scripture and becomes an Upper Clarity Perfected Person.\n\nThe Highest Supreme Primordial Lord and the Eight Elder Lords of Upper Clarity descended to teach the twenty-nine Perfected of the Dark Continent, enabling them to ascend to the Terrace of Langfeng.\n\nThe Later Sage-Lord journeyed to the Golden Dawn Flower Gate of Upper Clarity and entrusted the scripture to the Azure Lad of the Square Vase Palace, commanding him to teach the recorded names of immortals. Those whose names are inscribed in jade in the Perfected Register shall, upon achieving the Dao, return the scripture to the chamber of the Square Vase. Only then may they receive the scripture and ascend to the Great Tenuity.\n\nOrdinary people perceive the Seven Stars as near, yet do not realize how distant stepping them truly is. Daoists may know that the Celestial Net can be stepped, but they do not know that the hun and po do not follow the body. It is not that the body does not lead the hun and po, but rather that the hun and po fear the majesty of the Seven Stars and dare not follow the body in ascent. Thus, the three hun are not gathered, the seven po scatter, and one merely steps the Net with an empty corpse while the spirits do not follow—truly a vain labor.\n\nIf you wish to step the Net, calm the mind and empty the heart, freeing yourself from sorrow and worry, and casting aside thoughts of glory and flavor. Then circle three times, ascend the stars, and begin the invocation, causing the two spirits of hun and po to pass together through the Numinous Pass. Suddenly, the body is released, and in an instant, one forgets all grandeur and purity. Thereafter, stepping becomes as if treading empty space. After one year, you shall repel misfortune; after two years, you shall repel weapons; after three years, you shall repel death; after four years, you shall become an Earth Immortal. A thousand harms and ten thousand evils—none shall dare to encroach. From this point onward, blessings and fortune shall be boundless. You shall command spirits and employ numina, ride flying dragons, receive the Sacred Mushroom from the Great Ultimate, and be attended by jade lads from the Jade Emperor. After thirty-four years of practice, you shall become an Upper Clarity Perfected Person.\n\nTo step the Net, do not cross transversely against the Net. The straight lines connecting the boundaries of the stars are called the *Net*. To violate the transverse Celestial Net is to sever the Celestial Dao—a great prohibition. When stepping the Net, do not tread upon the stars of the Perfected—a great taboo. Violating either of these requires removing the headscarf, bowing, and apologizing to the Net’s image.\n\nUse cloth nine feet in length and six feet in width to arrange the star positions upon it. Mark the stars with blue ink and the Net with red ink. Store it in a clean box, and when you wish to practice, burn incense and take it out. Seven Jade Maidens attend the scripture, and seven Jade Lads guard the stars.\n\nWhen walking the paths of the world, if you tread the same roads as common people through fields and furrows, the flying dust will alone disturb you, and you shall share the same filth—under such conditions, you may not step the Net. However, if you dwell in the world but travel by carriage without seeing bloodshed or corpses, you may step the Net. If you reside in mountains and forests, observe long fasts, sever ties with the human world, dwell in cliffs and seclusion, or practice grain avoidance, then the taboos of treading dusty paths do not apply.\n\nAvoid eating the meat of the six domestic animals and the five pungent vegetables. Always bathe and wear clean clothes, burn incense at the place of stepping the Net, and face the direction of the Northern Dipper, aligning your head accordingly.\n\nBathing refers to the beginning of stepping the Net; it is not necessary to bathe before each stepping. The essential point is to ensure that hands, feet, mouth, and face are thoroughly clean.",

      "translated_text": "In overcast weather, the practice may be performed in a quiet chamber or upon one’s sleeping couch. Stepping the Net during daylight is especially superior to doing so at midnight, though in all cases, one should avoid being seen by others while performing the rite. The only requirements are to avoid passing through filth or stagnation and to maintain a focused mind.\n\nThe Most August Lord of the Grand Tenuity instructs the *Scripture on Stepping the Celestial Net*, meticulously following the supreme methods of the divine perfected. First, burn incense at the place of practice, then close the *qi* and circumambulate leftward three times around the exterior of the Dipper stars, beginning at *Yin Jing* and circling to *Yang Ming*. Upon completion, release the *qi* and only then may the feet tread upon the Seven Stars, with the body stepping toward *Yang Ming*.\n\nThereupon, face the *Yang Ming* star, close the *qi*, and silently invoke:\n*\"Great Constellation of Yang Ming, Dark Culmen of the Literary Florescence, may my hun and po together traverse the Celestial Net.\"*\nAfter the invocation, tread upon *Yang Ming* with the left foot, then advance the right foot to *Yin Jing*, and invoke:\n*\"Yin Jing, Northern Pivot, Supreme Jade Armillary, may my hun and po follow my body.\"*\nNext, tread upon *Xuan Ming* with the left foot and invoke:\n*\"Xuan Ming, Shaking Brilliance, Purple Tenuity’s Radiant Gate, may my hun and po together traverse the Jade Balance.\"*\nThen tread upon *Dan Yuan* with the right foot and invoke:\n*\"Dan Yuan, Purple Palace, Supreme Numinous Field, may my hun and po together cross the Divine Ford.\"*\nNext, tread upon *Bei Ji* with the left foot and invoke:\n*\"Bei Ji, Celestial Radiance, Revolving Dark Celestial Time, may my hun and po together reach the Dark Pass.\"*\nThen tread upon *Tian Guan* with the right foot, advance the left foot to align with the right, and release the breath. If one’s single breath does not suffice to complete the Net, one may release and re-close the *qi* at the *Dan Yuan* star.\n\nSoftly invoke:\n*\"Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth—five phases mutually propel. The Seven Stars gleam resplendent; the Celestial Net wields supreme might. The Auxiliary Stars guard flourishing; the Adjuvant Stars repel decline. The Nine Perfected of the Supreme, the Supreme Ultimate of the Grand Tenuity, the Three Treasuries of the Jade Emperors, the Three Venerables avert calamity. Heaven moves, Earth turns; hun and po follow one another. May I ascend as a flying immortal, my true radiance lingering. May my name enter the Golden Chamber, the Jade Gate open. Mounting the dragon, I ascend the void; sun and moon share their splendor. Roaming the Upper Clarity, ringing bells in jade-green robes, I seize lightning on the left and command thunder on the right. Ten thousand evils on earth dare not pursue; malevolent hearts gazing upon me are shattered and crushed. By the Emperor’s command, Jade Maidens attend my return. Hun, true soul, po, and spirit—unite in form to ascend and fly.\"*\n\nFor the reverse stepping method, halt at *Tian Guan*, turn to face *Bei Ji*, and softly invoke:\n*\"Supreme Primordial Time, Florid Canopy of Purple Numinosity, Jade Chamber of the Northern Culmen, concealing radiance and transforming essence. Grand Tenuity’s Dark Terrace, Nine Perfected’s Jade City—may I, as a flying immortal, traverse the Cloud Courts. Returning to step the Celestial Net, hun and po together live. Mounting the dragon to the Florid Palace, I attain the name of the Dao. On the left, I wear jade pendants; on the right, I gird golden bells. Tiger-sash and dragon-skirt, I whistle to command celestial soldiers. Riding the Three Pure Ones’ luminous essence, I ascend to the Upper Clarity.\"*\n\nAfter the invocation, close the *qi*, lift the left foot to tread upon *Bei Ji*, the right foot upon *Dan Yuan*. Next, lift the left foot to tread before *Xuan Ming*, align the right foot with the left, face the star of the Perfected, release the breath, and softly invoke:\n*\"Supreme Ultimate’s Nine Essences, Highest Perfected of the Primordial Sovereign—emerging to ascend the Primordial Clarity, entering to conceal in the Dark Yin. Nurturing my longevity, may I love immortality. The Jade Terrace suddenly opens; the Golden Hall’s eight gates—grant me the scripture to wear, crimson dragon and azure skirt. Above, assist the Purple Tenuity; later, the sagely lord. Riding ten flying dragons, dark canopy and luminous clouds, my name inscribed on the Primordial Chart, sun and moon conjoined.\"*\n\nAfter the invocation, close the *qi* again, tread upon the *Bi* star with the left foot, advance the right foot to *Yin Jing*, then advance the left foot before *Yang Ming*, align the right foot with the left, and release the breath. Softly invoke:\n*\"Celestial Constellation of Upright Yang, the Dipper’s revolving rise and fall. Turning the Primordial Mechanism before, moving the Numinous Net behind—restrain the po to pacify, constrain the hun to flourish. Hun and po with the body together traverse the Celestial Hall. Facing the Golden Portal, the Highest Supreme August One, the Immortal Mother on the right, the Immortal Father on the left. Purple and jade-green flying blossoms, dragon robes and tiger garments. Wearing the true scarf and jade, a halo born upon the neck. Hands grasping divine bells, waist girded with golden pendants. Mouth chanting the *Dongzhen*, sevenfold wondrous verses. First from emptiness and nonbeing, born to be king. Flying through the Nine Paths, grasping the Dipper and climbing the Net. Before following the Supreme Unity, behind following the Dark Gentleman. Imparting to me the oral formula, seated in disappearance, standing in vanishing. The essentials of reverse stepping—attaining the rank of Immortal Minister. The five viscera self-generate, greeting Heaven in accord. All wishes fulfilled, all prayers flourishing. Ten thousand evils submit in harm; shifting ground, they conceal. Those who hate me are punished by Heaven—drowned in water, perished in fire.\"*\n\nFor the reverse stepping method, close the *qi* again and circumambulate rightward three times around the exterior of the Dipper stars, beginning at *Yang Ming* and circling back to *Yang Ming*. Release the breath and invoke:\n*\"Highest Supreme Perfected, Seven Luminaries’ Most Venerable—reverse stepping to seek life, ascending to the Celestial Origin. May I, as a flying immortal, enter the Purple Gate.\"*\n\nThen close the *qi* again, tread upon *Yang Ming* with the left foot and *Yin Jing* with the right. First advance the right foot to tread upon *Xuan Ming*, the left foot upon *Dan Yuan*. Next, tread upon *Bei Ji* with the right foot and *Tian Guan* with the left. Advance the right foot to align with the left, release the breath, and invoke:\n*\"Sevenfold transformations reverse and revolve, ascending the Jade Asterisms. Six Records assist me; Three Nets align in stepping. The Jade Emperor glances left; the Highest Supreme gazes right. Teaching me to ride the stars, ascending the Dark Path—grant the boon of flying immortality, the blessing of undying destiny. Floating through the Upper Clarity, riding the Florid Three Pure Ones. Golden, azure, and jade-green skirts—entering and exiting the Nine Abodes. The Northern August One bows in greeting; the Southern Perfected acknowledges with thanks. My name inscribed on the Immortal Terrace—thousandfold transformations, myriad changes. Befriending the Sagely Lord, assisting the Great Peace. All wishes follow the heart; ten thousand affairs achieve fruition. Those who harbor evil against me—blade punishment, fire burial.\"*",

He entered and exited the Gate of Life, inhaling and exhaling the Void.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor received from the Xiangcheng Youth the method of *Stepping the Six Records*, practiced its essential secrets, and cast a tripod at Mount Jing, concealing his transformation at Qiaoling. He rode a dragon to the Dark Garden, mounting clouds to ascend the Towering Wind.\n\nGuangchengzi received from the Central Prime Youth of the Eastern Sea the method of *Stepping the Six Harms*, practiced its essential secrets, and rode the Tri-Subtle Clouds to the Boundless Wilderness. He harnessed eight flowery phoenixes and dragons, entered the Gate of Infinity, and traversed backward through the Great Void, attaining the rank of Jade Emperor.\n\nGong Zhongyang received from the Songgao Youth the method of *Stepping the Six Severances*, practiced its essential secrets, and ascended the Vermilion Radiance of the Cinnabar Mound. He rode the Dark Prime Chariot, drove ten flying cicadas, and roamed the Southern Darkness, with crimson clouds as his canopy, entering the Five Cities.\n\nThese four youths were all teachers of celestial perfection. The hidden scriptures they received and practiced were one and the same—only their names differed: *Three Principles*, *Six Records*, *Six Harms*, and *Six Severances*.\n\nIn spring, stepping the Seven Stars is called *Stepping the Three Principles*.\nIn summer, stepping the Seven Stars is called *Treading the Six Records*.\nIn autumn, stepping the Seven Stars is called *Walking the Six Harms*.\nIn winter, stepping the Seven Stars is called *Ascending the Six Severances*.\nPracticing these in secret, one floats and wanders in Supreme Clarity.\n\nMaster Wang said: \"In my time, I traversed the Zhou era, passed through the Warring States, wandered the strong Qin, and emerged in the great Han. I trod the earth’s sources, roamed the Nine Palaces, met various immortals, and questioned the perfected officials. When I first sought this Dao, all who stepped the Celestial Origin and practiced the Records and Principles attained the Way swiftly and without difficulty.\n\nThus:\n- Bei Yi stepped the Principles, and the Seven Essences descended to roam below.\n- Nie Que stepped the Principles and ascended to the Heavenly Hall.\n- Wang Ni stepped the Principles and rode clouds to the Ten Heavens.\n- The Yellow Emperor stepped the Principles, and his essence became the Xuanyuan.\n- Xu You stepped the Principles, and phoenixes flocked around him.\n- Chaofu stepped the Principles and ascended to attend the Heavenly Emperor.\n- Zhili stepped the Principles and dwelled in the Towering Wind.\n- Hua Feng stepped the Principles, and his body generated dark clouds.\n- Zizhou stepped the Principles and wore robes of green dragon and tiger.\n- Shanjuan stepped the Principles and rode a swift dragon torch.\n- Shihu stepped the Principles and flew to Yingzhou.\n- The Northern Man stepped the Principles, and jade maidens came to roam with him.\n- Pu Yi stepped the Principles and entered the Northern Dipper.\n- Master An stepped the Principles, and a red dragon bore him.\n- Huan Cheng stepped the Principles, met Wen Shi, gained a companion, and returned west with the Half-Chariot Youth.\n- The Two Women stepped the Principles, washed in white waters, met the Metal Mother, and dwelled on the Eastern Steps.\n- Bian Sui stepped the Principles and rode a dragon to the Grand Clarity.\n- Wu Guang stepped the Principles and transcended to the Purple Court.\n- Ma Huang stepped the Principles, and dragons and clouds arrived together.\n- Peng Zu stepped the Principles and journeyed to the Flowing Sands.\n- Lao Dan stepped the Principles, was hailed as the Sage Master, and the Pass Keeper received his teachings; together they ascended the Cloud Terrace.\n- Jiaojian stepped the Principles, rode a dragon to chase the stars, cast aside his fishing rod, and forever became an Upper Perfected.\n- Da Xiang stepped the Principles, and his complexion reverted to that of an infant.\n- The First Qin Emperor stepped the Principles, and a divine dragon spat forth a talisman.\n- Juanzi stepped the Principles, and the river yielded a spirit fish. He drank the Jade Liquid and ascended to the Dark Continent.\n- Xiao Shi stepped the Principles, recluded in the Qin Tower. Nongyu received his teachings, and together they reached the Green Mound.\n- Jieyu stepped the Principles, and husband and wife both became immortals. He governed Mount Emei and was enfeoffed over mountains and rivers.\n- Bohun stepped the Principles and was ranked among the Water Spirits.\n- Geng Sang stepped the Principles and roamed the Eight Darknesses.\n\nAll required this art for the essential Dao to be accomplished. Thus, I roughly record these figures to inform you. Some toiled first and later rested; those who underwent trials and did not falter also became earthbound immortals, attained the body of corpse liberation, or became lords of the underworld—numbering in the thousands. I cannot record all their names.\n\nAccording to the *True Statutes of the Four Poles*, those who achieve corpse liberation or become underworld lords must wait one hundred forty years to be appointed as immortal officials, then another one thousand three hundred years to be appointed as perfected officials. Only then may they ride flowery canopies, harness many dragons, ascend the Great Ultimate, and roam the Nine Palaces.\n\nDiligently follow the methods and practice them—none will fail to attain immortality. With focused heart and earnest sincerity, it takes but fourteen years. Then the essence of the Seven Stars will descend, transforming into divine beings. Together they will ride the Flowing Chimes and Eight Effulgences, their cinnabar and dark clouds arrayed, all coming to you. They will bow to you as an immortal official, bestow upon you the true talismans, and with the Dao accomplished, ascend to Supreme Clarity and the Palace of the Grand Tenuity.\n\nStrive and be diligent—all you seek will be realized. Why be lazy and become a lord of the underworld in the Dark Yin, waiting another one hundred forty years before ascending? I, too, attained this through diligence.\n\nOn the days of stepping the Principles, practice for seven days each month: the first, fifth, ninth, fifteenth, twentieth, twenty-fifth, and twenty-ninth days. If stepping at night, do so at midnight; if by day, at noon. If in a secluded place, practicing at noon in the courtyard is auspicious—only avoid being seen by the vulgar. If they witness it, the celestial essence will not descend.\n\nWhen the Dipper’s handle aligns with the first month (yin), the lunar establishment is in yin. At dark dusk, the Celestial Pass faces yin; at dawn, it faces shen; at noon, it faces hai. Simply follow the lunar establishment of the Dipper to calculate day and night, always knowing its position, and align with the diagram accordingly.\n\nIf you encounter malevolent ghosts or wicked people, visualize the Dipper’s stars pointing at them, hold your breath, and silently recite: *'I am the Heavenly Eye, moving with Heaven. My gaze is like lightning, illuminating the eight directions. I see through all, inside and out—nothing disobeys me.'* Thus, all treacherous and malevolent ghosts, all calamities and misfortunes, will not dare to approach you.\n\nOn jiazi days and the eight solar terms, stepping the Principles will attain immortality and summon the Seven Stars to you.\"",

      "translated_text": "Those who practice the Stepping of the Principles must not sleep at dusk on winter jiazi days, lest the radiance of the Seven Stars obscure their eyesight.\n\nThe method for stepping the Principles to shed one’s death-name and inscribe it upon the Jade Register employs the following days: the third day of the first month, the eleventh day of the second month, the nineteenth day of the third month, the eighth day of the fourth month, the fifth day of the fifth month, the ninth day of the sixth month, the seventh day of the seventh month, the fourth day of the eighth month, the ninth day of the ninth month, the fifth day of the tenth month, the eighth day of the eleventh month, and the twelfth day of the twelfth month. Stepping the Principles on these days will erase the record of death from the Palace of Fangzhu and the Terrace of Na, inscribing instead the character for \"life.\"\n\nIn the first month, one may step the Principles seven times, following the usual method. If sudden emergencies or misfortunes such as illness arise, one may step the Principles at once without waiting for an auspicious day. Whatever is spoken or invoked must be done with intent. First recite the established text in full, then state one’s personal wishes—both will take immediate effect, swifter than water or fire.\n\nFor women stepping the Principles, the image of the Principles is made of crimson silk; for men, it is made of cloth. The *Supreme Hidden Writ in Gold Tablets and Jade Characters* is the essential scripture for stepping the Celestial Principles, soaring through the Earthly Traces, ascending to the Supreme Clarity, and entering the Purple Tenuity.\n\nThe Supreme Lord always dispatches seven Divine Lads of the Western Numinosity, their faces adorned with jade blossoms, to attend the image of the Seven Stars. When stepping the Principles, these lads ascend the stars alongside the practitioner. Beginners do not see them at first, but after one year, they will often dream of these seven lads by their side, and within three years, their forms will appear before them. They wear flying topknots, dark-yellow and azure robes, and hold ointments of rosy clouds and incense, with vermilion lamps.\n\nThe Supreme Lord also dispatches the Southern Perfected Numinous Consort and the Purple Numinous Proud Maidens, their faces adorned with golden and azure dragon blossoms, to attend this hidden writ. When stepping the Principles, these divine maidens ascend the stars alongside the practitioner. Beginners do not see them at first, but after one year, they will often dream of these seven maidens by their side, and within three years, their forms will appear before them. They wear flying side-knots, cinnabar and azure robes, and hold black unguents from the Clothing Spring, sun-bright incense, and lamps. One must fast and purify for seven days before transmitting this scripture, and the recipient must do the same.\n\nAccording to the *Supreme Four Limits of Luminous Regulations*, this scripture may be transmitted only once every hundred years. Within seven hundred years, each master may transmit it to no more than three disciples. Beyond this number, it may not be further transmitted. Transmission must be preceded by purification rites, oaths of alliance, and vows of secrecy. The master must examine the disciple’s heart, probe their depth, assess their sincerity, and weigh their goodness or wickedness before entrusting the scripture to them. If one’s bone destiny is not aligned, they will not receive this writ.\n\nIf a mere walking corpse or one with a fair exterior but corrupt nature attempts to test the scripture without awakening, they may incur enmity, suffer injury or death, or disrupt harmony in life. Such individuals are not true disciples of the Dao and will meet with misfortune to halt their progress. Do not explain the reason. The Seven Celestial Lords of Numinosity, great spirits of the Dao and virtue, observe honor and disgrace and bestow corresponding blessings—do not worry.\n\nThis is the ultimate truth and the method of later sages, sufficient to gauge those with intent and to recognize those without ability. If you perceive the trials, you must first bow and offer thanks to the spirits of the Seven Stars to rectify your errors.\n\nThe Eight Endowments Formula states:\nIt is not the pursuit of immortality that is difficult, but finding the right person.\nIt is not the study of the Dao that is difficult, but receiving its scriptures.\nIt is not receiving the scriptures that is difficult, but passing the trials without realizing it.\nIt is not the trials themselves that are difficult, but practicing the scriptures with utmost sincerity.\n\nThe Supreme Lord’s secret words are wondrous and true.\n\nThe Supreme Lord’s Purple Writ, as recorded by Perfected Lord Wang, states in the *Azure Essentials and Purple Writ*: \"If you wish to ascend to Heaven, you must practice the Seven Numinosities. Having ascended the Northern Culmen, you will enter the Purple Court. Do not transmit this to the unworthy; first test their disposition.\" This is the proper discourse on stepping the Principles.\n\nWhen I first received the divine scripture, someone tested me by striking my hand with a staff for no reason, drawing blood. I still turned my heart toward them, my thoughts unwavering—this was the trial I had to pass. I then obtained this scripture, and was told, \"Yesterday, you traversed water and fire and emerged unscathed.\" At first, I did not understand these words, but later realized the trial was the striking of my hand.\n\nOnce, I transmitted the divine scripture to someone, and the method included a trial of casting them into peril. Before transmission, I suddenly set fire to their clothes. Their garments burned away, yet they said nothing, and their expression showed no great fear. Though their demeanor did not betray wickedness, and no evil words escaped their lips, they had passed the trial. I later transmitted to them the hidden scripture of stepping the Principles.\n\nThrough its practice, they attained the Dao and ascended to the Supreme Ultimate. There, they saw an inscription on the northern wall of the Supreme Ultimate, which read: \"Mao Ying of Xianyang received the scripture of stepping the Principles. His master tested him by burning his clothes. Though he did not speak, his expression was unsettled. This was a minor flaw, not true purity. He may traverse the Supreme Ultimate but must not ascend to the Supreme Clarity.\"\n\nUpon reading the inscription, Mao Ying was dismayed. Reflecting on his trial since receiving the scripture, he realized he had not perceived the flaw of his unsettled expression and qi. Ninety-eight years had passed, and he now understood that the mysterious mirror of the Celestial Principles records even the smallest details. He then redoubled his efforts, vowing to the Supreme Perfected Ones, and was finally appointed a minister of the Imperial Sovereign.\n\nTake heed of this, for Perfected Lord Wang has imparted these words to the Lesser Perfected Lord.\n\nThe *Jade Essence Hidden Writ and True Formula* beckons the hidden mushrooms of the Supreme Ultimate, adorned with kingfisher plumes and flowered robes, purple embroidered feathered capes, and cinnabar and azure flying skirts. The numinous mountains of the Five Peaks, the Six Origins and Seven Mysteries, the Perfected Ones of the Earth, and the wandering immortals each present their tribute and submit memorials to the Palace of the Supreme Tenuity.",

Mastering its secrets, one is appointed as an Immortal Duke.\n\nThe *Supreme Hidden Writ* states: On the first day of the first month, the twentieth day of the second month, and the twenty-seventh day of the third month, having completed the pacing of the celestial guidelines, align the body within the Dipper’s *Kui* asterism, face east, and visualize the Jupiter’s stellar essence within the liver. Bow twice, kneel, and pray:\n*\"Primordial Spirit of the Great Year, Wood Duke of the Nine Heavens, Radiant Yang and Mysterious Origin, all enter this body.\"*\nAfter the prayer, click the teeth nine times. Practicing this for fourteen years, the Lord of the Eastern Peak presents a robe of azure feathers, and the Perfected One of the Eastern Pole commands the Mysterious Origin Earth Spirits and the numinous mountains to deliver the raiment of the Supreme Clarity—verdant plumes and flowered skirts.\n\nThe *Supreme Hidden Writ* states: On the eighth day of the fourth month, the fifth day of the fifth month, and the eighteenth day of the sixth month, having completed the pacing of the celestial guidelines, align the body within the Dipper’s *Kui*, face south, and visualize Mars’ stellar essence within the heart. Bow twice, kneel, and pray:\n*\"Southern Supreme Spirit of the Upper Origin, Fiery Yang of Four Lights, Vermilion Waters of Zhongli, enter the cinnabar chamber.\"*\nAfter the prayer, click the teeth nine times. Practicing this for fourteen years, the Lord of the Southern Peak presents flying feathers, and the Perfected One of the Southern Pole commands the Mysterious Origin Earth Spirits and the numinous mountains to deliver the raiment of the Supreme Clarity—a purple-embroidered feathered cape.\n\nThe *Supreme Hidden Writ* states: On the seventh day of the seventh month, the twentieth day of the eighth month, and the ninth day of the ninth month, having completed the pacing of the celestial guidelines, align the body within the Dipper’s *Kui*, face west, and visualize Venus’ stellar essence within the lungs. Bow twice, kneel, and pray:\n*\"Western Supreme Mystery, Golden Essence of Seven Paths, Jade Origin of the Two Emperors, qi returns to the fetal brain.\"*\nAfter the prayer, click the teeth nine times. Practicing this for fourteen years, the Lord of the Western Peak presents a curved morning-flight canopy, and the Perfected One of the Western Pole commands the Mysterious Origin Earth Spirits and the numinous mountains to deliver the raiment of the Supreme Clarity—cinnabar and azure flying skirts.\n\nThe *Supreme Hidden Writ* states: On the fifth day of the tenth month, the third day of the eleventh month, and the sixth day of the twelfth month, having completed the pacing of the celestial guidelines, align the body within the *Kui*, face north, and visualize Mercury’s stellar essence within the kidneys. Bow twice, kneel, and pray:\n*\"Northern Mysterious Purple Dawn, Golden Chariot and Water Origin, Dragon Embryo transforming into spirit, enter this body.\"*\nAfter the prayer, click the teeth nine times. Practicing this for fourteen years, the Lord of the Northern Peak presents a dragon robe and tiger belt, and the Perfected One of the Northern Pole commands the Mysterious Origin Earth Spirits and the numinous mountains to deliver the raiment of the Supreme Clarity—a phoenix-brocade dark kerchief and a lotus-essence purple crown.\n\nThus, by paying homage to the Four Poles and invoking the ethereal essences of the Four Stars, praying to the hidden names of the Four Origins, one obtains the feathered capes for wandering in the Supreme Clarity.\n\nThe *Outer Scripture* states: \"Wings fully formed\" does not mean the body grows feathers. Rather, by ascending the celestial guidelines, preserving the *Kui*’s true essence, bowing to the spirits of the Five Essences, and praying to the names of the Four Origins, one elicits numinous offerings to ascend to the Supreme Clarity. Thus, the feathered robes descend from the mysterious, truly through the power of sincerity.\n\nThe *Supreme Hidden Writ* states: On every *jiazi* day and the eight solar terms, having completed the pacing of the celestial guidelines, align the body behind the *Bi* star within the *Kui*, face the Perfected Star, and visualize Saturn’s stellar essence within the spleen. Bow twice, kneel, and pray:\n*\"Nine Perfected Ones of the Supreme Ultimate, Flowing Prosperity of the Yin Root, Flying Unity and Retreating Canopy, enter the Muddy Pellet.\"*\nAfter the prayer, click the teeth nine times. Practicing this for fourteen years, the Lord of the Central Peak presents a jade pendant, golden earrings, a white-feathered canopy, and a purple cover. The Perfected One of the Supreme Ultimate commands the Three Mysteries Grotto-Heavens, Yang Terrace Celestial Realm, Commissioned Feather Numinous Prefecture, Nine Doubts Mysterious Divine Mound, and the Red Flaming Three Terraces to deliver the Golden Perfected Jade Radiance and the Supreme Ultimate Hidden Mushrooms.\n\nThe Supreme Ultimate Hidden Mushrooms have four varieties. One kind has four directional colors, its light illuminating a hundred paces like the moon. Another is azure, resembling stacked bright mirrors, each face about five or six *cun* in diameter, its light penetrating and clear, three layers stacked, six or seven *cun* high. It is called the *Supreme Ultimate Numinous Mirror Hidden Heavenly Azure Mushroom*. Another is white, resembling a sturdy Dipper star, with seven nodes marked by stars and stems as guidelines, over three or four *chi* tall, its light bright and penetrating. It is called the *Supreme Ultimate Mysterious Node Hidden Stellar Spirit Mushroom*. Another is crimson, like a small jujube tree, its fruit ring-shaped, its light brilliant and radiant, three or four *chi* tall. It is called the *Ring Guideline Hidden Mysterious Supreme Ultimate Golden Heaven Mushroom*. Striking its branches produces sounds like jade and gold. Another is dark green, resembling an overturned canopy on the ground, sometimes layered and stacked, about seven or eight *cun* in circumference, its pure light flowing like a candle, three or four *cun* high. It is called the *Supreme Ultimate Mysterious Moon Reclining Dragon Mushroom*.\n\nThese are the names of the Supreme Ultimate Hidden Mushrooms. Through sincere seeking and supplication, the Three Mysteries’ divine Perfected Ones all bestow them upon you. They may appear in marshes, unusual places, mountains, hills, or dwellings. Wherever they manifest, the Perfected Ones grant them to you. Consuming them, the Supreme Tenuity dispatches envoys to appoint you as an Immortal Duke, allowing you to multiply your forms ten thousandfold and your body to emanate jade-like radiance.\n\nThe *Supreme Hidden Writ of Pacing the Celestial Guidelines and Flying the Six Records Jade Scripture* was later requested by the Sage Lords and bestowed upon the Azure Lad of the Square Cauldron Palace, who transmitted it to those destined for immortality by bone and fate. Even those without their names in the immortal registers or jade books of the Dao may, by chance, encounter this jade scripture.\n\nThe statutes of the Perfected Ones of the Four Poles permit its transmission only thrice within seven hundred years, each transmission requiring oaths, written covenants on precious silk, and strict confidentiality to honor the supreme numinous. The scripture is strictly forbidden from mingling with other texts.\n\nFor those receiving the secrets of pacing the Seven Origins’ planetary stars, oaths must be sworn on thirty-two *chi* of silk, corresponding to the numbers one, five, and seven. For those receiving the secrets of pacing the Five Stars, oaths must be sworn on a golden dragon and jade fish, corresponding to the numbers two, four, and six.",

      "translated_text": "This system follows the subtle configurations and precise divisions of the celestial patterns, hence the necessity of binding oaths. Since golden dragons and jade fish are nonexistent in the world, one must not withhold the scripture while awaiting such rare tokens. Instead, thirty *chi* of blue cloth may serve as the standard for this oath, demonstrating its beginning and end and manifesting one’s sincerity and reverence. This offering shall be presented to the master who holds the scripture, and the master in turn must distribute it without hoarding for personal gain. Violating the covenant incurs the judgment of the Three Officials, a matter of no small consequence. The Perfected Ones esteem blue as the token of trust and gold as the symbol of sincerity; whenever oaths are sworn, these are invoked as proof.\n\nThose who breach the statutes or leak the secrets commit grave offenses, extending punishment to their grandparents and subjecting them to the torments of hell. The objects of oaths must always be placed in the highest regard and never disclosed to others.\n\nThe *Three Charts of the Celestial Pass* state:\n*\"Cultivate the root with essence,\nAwaken the heart with balance,\nUnite the origin with sincerity—\nAll endeavors shall flourish.\nThe Perfected Ones treasure covenants,\nCherish gold and revere blue.\nHarmonize with incantations,\nPoint to them as pledges—\nThis oath is mighty;\nDo not violate or take it lightly.\"*\n\nEach transmission of oaths is bound by numerical limits. Those who, without proper transmission, recklessly reveal the titles of scripture passages commit the offense of leakage. The Jade Lads and Jade Maidens shall report to the Most High; after three such violations, one’s name reappears in the registers of death, and immortality is forever forfeited.\n\nAll transmissions must adhere to the covenant, and the recipient must return the gold and blue cloth to the master as an encouragement of merit and virtue. The Most High’s *Jade Scripture* and hidden writings are all stored in separate cases. When practicing or consulting them, one must burn incense, with Jade Lads and Jade Maidens standing guard on either side—do not assume their absence merely because they are unseen.\n\nThe numinous mirror of the Perfected Ones, descending from the Supreme Void, scrutinizes even the most minute intentions. How could one fail to be vigilant?\n\nIn the world, there also exists the method of *Pacing the Celestial Net and Treading the Earthly Records*. During the first year of the Yangshuo era, Wang Feng, the Grand Marshal of Emperor Cheng of Han, heard that the Daoist Liu Jing had studied immortality under Zhang Jun of Handan and obtained the method of *Pacing the Celestial Net*. Feng pressured him with authority and rank, and Jing, unable to refuse, secretly compiled an abridged version to give him. Feng regarded it as the key to longevity and wealth, practicing it in utmost secrecy and transmitting it within his clan. Thus, its invocations often employed terms of wealth, rank, and emolument, utilizing the days of *Heavenly Granary* and *Heavenly Treasury* for their conjunctions.\n\nThe emergence of this abridgment began with Liu Jing. By the end of the Han, he also showed it to Huangfu Long, who likewise revered and practiced it. Yet such superficial teachings—how could they move heaven and earth or stir the divine Perfected Ones?\n\nWang Se, a disciple of Feng, was enfeoffed as a marquis during Wang Mang’s reign. He claimed the *Scripture of Pacing the Celestial Net* was a celestial omen, casting it onto golden tablets and presenting it to Mang. What limit could there be to the benefits of *Pacing the Celestial Net*? Yet without seeing the true original text and its essential instructions, one already gains boundless advantage—how much more so if one attains its root?\n\nThe abridged method spread widely through the world, originating with Liu Jing and persisting to this day. As for the *Great Secrets of the Most High’s Jade Scripture on Flying Records and Pacing the Earthly Net*, Jing treasured and concealed them, and none knew to whom he transmitted them.\n\n*The Scripture of the Golden Tablets and Jade Characters on Pacing the Celestial Net and Flying the Earthly Records of the Supreme Lord of the Great Mystery of Highest Clarity*...",
