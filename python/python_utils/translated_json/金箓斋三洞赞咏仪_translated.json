Palace, and Duke of Qinghe*\n\n**Volume One: Ten Poems on the *Bu Xu* (Ascending the Void)**\n\n---\n**1.**\nA golden altar stands in serene stillness,\nThe Dao’s great principle, effortless and vast.\nBefore the Jade Emperor, I take refuge,\nBowing to seek the Source’s true intent.\n\nIncense burns with sacred hymns,\nA single mind, undivided, unceasing.\nMay I join the myriad gods of land and sea,\nA billion immortals in celestial grace.\n\nWithin the boundless void, enlightenment dawns—\nMystic discourse flows like breath between us.\nThe True Ones receive their heavenly mandate,\nAwakened to the beginning and the end.\n\nBeyond form, delight in boundless ease—\nYet foolish hearts spawn slander and deceit.\nWith dragon-umbrellas, they ride the six dragons,\nTraversing the waters of the eight directions.\n\n---\n**2.**\nThe Jade Seal’s scriptures, taught by the Master,\nRituals honor the Most High.\nPraise resounds through the world’s expanse,\nDaoist practice and heart align as one.\n\nWith *Lingbao* scriptures, all beings are saved,\nDanqiu’s clouds and rains gather in shadow.\nIn emptiness, the *Taiqing* is entered,\nWhite cranes cry out in piercing calls.\n\nAll valleys bow in reverence,\nMists and clouds in splendor arrayed.\nThe dust of the world cannot ensnare,\nThe secret doors open, then close.\n\nThe deepest caverns guard their solemnity,\nNo bonds hold back the gods and immortals.\nHeaven’s height is flat as the palm—\nEach moment refined, each detail precise.\n\n---\n**3.**\nThe Most High transforms without end,\nImmortal abodes in the Purple Palace reside.\nFaith fades like mist into the void,\nBowing to Heaven and Earth, I kneel.\n\nThe sky clears, stars scatter like embroidery,\nThe True Gate holds the One without duality.\nTen states shower with rainflowers,\nFive blessings hidden by the True Ones.\n\nAuspicious omens mark their reverence,\nTrembling, they lift the sacred vessels.\nOh, noble masters of the Law,\nPraying for blessings from the mortal realm.\n\nThree thousand merits fulfilled,\nYet their resolve never wavers.\nThey take refuge in the Dao’s sovereign,\nAll spirits record their names.\n\n---\n**4.**\nThe immortals gather in the Mystic Capital,\nWhere the Dharma Wheel eternally turns.\nWith fasting bells and precious chimes,\nWinter and summer know no heat or cold.\n\nThe Crimson Node’s Peach Blossom Palace,\nYingzhou’s shores stretch to distant shores.\nThe Celestial Sovereign stands attended,\nDaoist virtue silences all private speech.\n\nEntering the Great Vehicle’s scriptures,\nThe six passions dissolve like mist.\nSilent, the mind remains steadfast,\nSerene, unshaken by doubt.\n\nWhen the moon shines bright and full,\nFair maidens grind with jade pestles.\nChimes strike in harmonious tones,\nRefining essence, granting beauty’s grace.\n\n---\n**5.**\nHeaven’s laws govern mortal affairs,\nThe Yellow-robed Sage receives the Jade Seal.\nScriptures open the Dao’s clear vision,\nDevotion brings swift fruition.\n\nIf evil spirits dare to approach,\nDespair grips them like withered grass.\nThe *Dantian* is the root of life—\nBowing or rising, blessings arise.\n\nCranes’ bones feast on celestial dew,\nTheir practice as wild as mountain deer.\nWithin the Three Powers’ lush abundance,\nThey hold their scrolls, diligent in study.\n\nTaiyi and the Star Officials,\nBring prosperity without reversal.\nReturning to purity, rooted in truth,\nThe four seasons stretch in perfect measure.\n\n---\n**6.**\nAspiring to the Dao, seeking True Nature,\nKnowing the One is not to grasp at forms.\nFirst, refine the mind with earnest toil,\nTransforming the vulgar into the sublime.\n\nRituals of repentance must be sincere,\nAscending the platform, bright as day.\nThe Six *Ding* spirits obey with ease,\nComing and going like swift winds.\n\nIncantations and divine talismans,\nNo evil spirit escapes their might.\nPetitions in green script,\nGood and ill, fortune and misfortune revealed.\n\nFrom *Yuan Shi*’s celestial ranks,\nSacred words divide the cosmic cycles.\nIncense, lamps, and ritual tea,\nAnointing the divine with sacred ink and brush.\n\n---\n**7.**\nThe Seven-Treasured Lapis Palace,\nFlying talismans arrayed in crimson.\n*Yujing* governs the ten directions,\nAll True Ones chant the Mystic Formula.\n\nHeaven and Earth in boundless void,\nClouds drift without end.\nThe Great Immortal rides a crane in play,\nRituals pure, their solemnity unbroken.\n\nTheir praises are beyond compare,\nEternal life, never fading.\nThe Most High subdues the Demon King,\nTheir attendants are sages without peer.\n\nThey descend to guide the common folk,\nSpirit Officials in orderly ranks.\nFragrant flowers trail from their palanquins,\nTeaching spreads through every tongue.\n\n---\n**8.**\nThe precious gongs resound with the *Lunyang*,\nAll immortals gather in assembly.\nMeasuring virtue’s heights and depths,\nThe shallow cannot enter their realm.\n\nThe *Ruyi* Pearl spins in celestial grace,\nDestroying falsehood, nurturing the true.\nBefore the Jade Emperor’s court,\nTrue Ones stand in silent attendance.\n\nListening to the *Bu Xu*’s natural flow,\nGazing upward at *Huaxu*’s domain.\nRiding cranes or dragons, radiant light ascends,\nThree thousand merits fulfilled—\nThe Elixir Field’s great pearl is refined.\n\n*Xuandu* governs the eight directions,\nAt the altar, all is lush and verdant.\nBreezes spread their teachings far,\nNurturing life through breath’s embrace.\n\n---\n**9.**\nSun, moon, five stars shine in justice,\nJudging virtue and vice with fairness.\nThe Three Officials and Five Emperors,\nBillions roam in endless delight.\n\nDharma rains fall as they pass,\nRiding clouds, mounted on cranes.\nA glance from the *Ruyi* transforms the body,\nTheir teachings build cities of enlightenment.\n\nFragrant and vast within the void,\nThe True Ancestors dwell in tranquil ease.\nThe Nine Heavens bless all things abundantly,\nJewel forests’ leaves intertwine.\n\nThe *Xiang* teachings bring mortal blessings,\nImmortal flowers bloom in purple calyxes.\nYin and yang turn the Wheel of Wisdom,\nThe Great Dao rests in the heart’s foundation.\n\n---\n**10.

robes.\n\n*(Right ten)**\n\n**Ten Seven-Character Poems of the Scattered Flowers**\n\nWhere do the scattered flowers bloom most thick?\nIn the high heavens, where the great *Luó* resides.\nTheir birth here is unlike the world’s,\nHow much more when the auspicious dew and clouds unite in celebration.\n\n*(Right one)*\nAt Kun Qiu’s peak stands the Tortoise Terrace,\nWhere strange flowers bloom through all four seasons.\nNot for the immortals’ tribute to the Jade Emperor,\nHow else would they scatter to the mortal realm?\n\n*(Right two)*\nThe heavenly flowers bloom day and night,\nUnlike mortal blossoms that wait for spring.\nThe heavenly flowers are plucked by heavenly folk,\nOffered to the layered city—how many times?\n\n*(Right three)*\nThe jade terrace at midnight is touched by

mid-heaven,\nGazing down upon the precious halls with earnest intent.\nFrom Penglai’s peaks, they pluck flowers without number,\nScattered before the hallowed court of the august throne.\n\n*(Right seven)*\nThe Upper Garden’s flowers bloom before spring’s arrival,\nWhile the secluded valleys’ warblers have yet to sing.\nThey do not send common folk to pluck and gather,\nBut reserve them all for the sacred land’s true immortals.\n\n*(Right eight)*\nWithin the caves, the thirty-six heavens of spring,\nThe immortal realm’s wonders ever differ from mortal life.\nWhere do they take the named flowers when plucked?\nTo the celestial halls, where the Highest True Ones dwell.\n\n*(Right nine)*\nThe true companions of the immortal court come and go in haste,\nTo behold the spring of Pengshan and Lanyuan.\nEach time they pluck fragrant blossoms to honor the Emperor,\nThey pray for blessings to be shared with all living beings.\n\n*(Right ten)*\nThe *Jin Qí* Hall’s Three Caverns of Praise

sculptor’s intent could match this?\n\n*(Right ten)*\n**Ten Verses on the White Crane**\n\nConceived in the womb of *tàihuà*, the spirit bird calls from the Ninth Heaven,\nIts snowy plumage and vermilion crown both radiant.\nMortals mistake it for the *Huábiǎo*—\nYet it heralds eternal peace for ten thousand ages.\n\n*(Right one)*\nOn the *Yáo* terrace, the wind stirs at dawn’s first division,\nIts beak upturned, startled by the fresh dew’s chill.\nIt lingers at the *Tàiyè*, unable to return,\nOnce in a past *jié* it took the form of a *qílín*.\n\n*(Right two)*\nThe spirit crane glides down from the *Tàiqīng*,\nPast jade towers and golden halls where morning breezes sigh.\nIt scorns the company of roosters,\nOften uttering sounds that pierce the heavens beyond things.\n\n*(Right three)*\nThe path to the Three Mountains crosses no distant sea,\nA celestial omen descends to the Pure Capital below the Azure Mists.\nIts feathers, frost-white as snow, its nature, ice and jade—\nFrom the depths of the *Yáo* Pool, it pecks at the spirit shoots.\n\n*(Right four)*\nIts plumage gleams with refined *jīnhuǒ* essence,\nEver attending the Queen Mother’s feast at the *Yáo* Pool.\nAt the jade altar’s midnight rites, the immortals descend,\nFlying past the *Gōushān*—none on earth take note.\n\n*(Right five)*\nThrough the Five Cloud Palaces, it strides the void without end,\nAs the stars wheel and the night knows no close.\nThe white crane arrives bearing auspicious tidings,\nIts clear song joins the returning *hún* incense.\n\n*(Right six)*\nA single cry echoes through the Nine Marshes,\nIts bones transmuted, its lightness deepening with years.\nThe Eastern Sea’s folk recognize it not—\nYet in the *Dàluó* Heaven, it finds its kin.\n\n*(Right seven)*\nIts white feathers gleam, untouched by frost’s hue,\nIts vermilion crown outshines the crimson silk.\nSix hundred years of divine *qì* refined,\nIts cries forever accompany the jade immortals.\n\n*(Right eight)*\nWhen the *Pénglái* gathering disperses, the Perfected return,\nTheir feathered steeds drift—white cranes take flight.\nIn the Ming dynasty, such omens were commonplace,\nWhy need the *Yuèfǔ* praise the golden robes?\n\n*(Right nine)*\nThe jade vaults sink into auspicious mist,\nThe fragrant wind lingers as the crane hesitates.\nIts rare form distinguishes it from the *Qīngtián*—\nSurely the immortals arrive in order.\n\n*(Right ten)*\nThe *Jīn Fù* ritual concludes the Three Caverns’ eulogies.",

the Palace, and Duke of Qinghe*\n\n**Volume One: Ten Poems on the *Bu Xu* (Ascending the Void)**\n\n---\n**1.**\nA golden altar stands in serene stillness,\nThe Dao’s great principle, effortless and vast.\nBefore the Jade Emperor, I take refuge,\nBowing to seek the Source’s true intent.\n\nIncense burns with sacred hymns,\nA single mind, undivided, unceasing.\nMay I join the myriad gods of land and sea,\nA billion immortals in celestial grace.\n\nWithin the boundless void, enlightenment dawns—\nMystic discourse flows like breath between us.\nThe True Ones receive their heavenly mandate,\nAwakened to the beginning and the end.\n\nBeyond form, delight in boundless ease—\nYet foolish hearts spawn slander and deceit.\nWith dragon-umbrellas, they ride the six dragons,\nTraversing the waters of the eight directions.\n\n---\n**2.**\nThe Jade Seal’s scriptures, taught by the Master,\nRituals honor the Most High.\nPraise resounds through the world’s expanse,\nDaoist practice and heart align as one.\n\nWith *Lingbao* scriptures, all beings are saved,\nDanqiu’s clouds and rains gather in shadow.\nIn emptiness, the *Taiqing* is entered,\nWhite cranes cry out in piercing calls.\n\nAll valleys bow in reverence,\nMists and clouds in splendor arrayed.\nThe dust of the world cannot ensnare,\nThe secret doors open, then close.\n\nThe deepest caverns guard their solemnity,\nNo bonds hold back the gods and immortals.\nHeaven’s height is flat as the palm—\nEach moment refined, each detail precise.\n\n---\n**3.**\nThe Most High transforms without end,\nImmortal abodes in the Purple Palace reside.\nFaith fades like mist into the void,\nBowing to Heaven and Earth, I kneel.\n\nThe sky clears, stars scatter like embroidery,\nThe True Gate holds the One without duality.\nTen states shower with rainflowers,\nFive blessings hidden by the True Ones.\n\nAuspicious omens mark their reverence,\nTrembling, they lift the sacred vessels.\nOh, noble masters of the Law,\nPraying for blessings from the mortal realm.\n\nThree thousand merits fulfilled,\nYet their resolve never wavers.\nThey take refuge in the Dao’s sovereign,\nAll spirits record their names.\n\n---\n**4.**\nThe immortals gather in the Mystic Capital,\nWhere the Dharma Wheel eternally turns.\nWith fasting bells and precious chimes,\nWinter and summer know no heat or cold.\n\nThe Crimson Node’s Peach Blossom Palace,\nYingzhou’s shores stretch to distant shores.\nThe Celestial Sovereign stands attended,\nDaoist virtue silences all private speech.\n\nEntering the Great Vehicle’s scriptures,\nThe six passions dissolve like mist.\nSilent, the mind remains steadfast,\nSerene, unshaken by doubt.\n\nWhen the moon shines bright and full,\nFair maidens grind with jade pestles.\nChimes strike in harmonious tones,\nRefining essence, granting beauty’s grace.\n\n---\n**5.**\nHeaven’s laws govern mortal affairs,\nThe Yellow-robed Sage receives the Jade Seal.\nScriptures
