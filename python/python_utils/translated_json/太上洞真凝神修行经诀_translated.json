  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Cavern of Perfection’s Scripture on Concentrating the Spirit and Cultivating the Dao: Secret Instructions**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Cavern of Perfection’s Scripture on Concentrating the Spirit and Cultivating the Dao: Secret Instructions*. One scroll. In truth, this comprises the latter half of Zhongli Quan’s *Song of Breaking Delusion to Realize the Dao*. Originating in the late Tang dynasty. Source text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, Cavern of Perfection, Jade Instructions category.\n\n---\n\nA single instruction reveals the principles of Heaven and Earth,\nSweeping away heterodox paths without a trace.\nIn primordial chaos, the spirit congeals—this is the Dao of immortals,\nHeaven and Earth are void, above and below empty.\n\nThis instruction is not held in the mouth nor chanted,\nBut when the heart awakens, understanding breaks free from the mortal cage.\nPiercing the barrier between Wood and Metal without inquiry,\nTrue Lead and True Mercury are the essences of Heaven and Earth.\nWho knows this principle of immortality?\nTo awaken to this instruction is to succeed.\n\nNeither Kan nor Li, nor Dragon nor Tiger,\nNeither Crow nor Hare, neither West nor East.\nNot the liver, not the lungs, not the heart nor kidneys,\nHow could it involve the spleen, stomach, gallbladder, or essence?\n\nNeither thought nor action—acting without acting,\nNot congealing true darkness nor vainly straining the spirit.\nIt does not emerge from the Three Fields, above or below,\nHow could it depend on the spine reaching to Kunlun?\n\nIt is not essence, fluids, black blood, or marrow,\nNor the radiant spirits of the five viscera.\nThis thing does not arise from the human body,\nNor in spring, summer, autumn, or winter.\nWho recognizes the precelestial and preterrestrial?\nThe two qi merge, each weighing a catty.\n\nNew moon and full moon, dark and crescent, align with the fundamental number,\nCircling day and night without cease.\nFollow the time to gather a tender fragment,\nHarvest it at the center, aligning with Jia and Geng.\n\nEmerging in the southwest as the birthplace of the medicine,\nGently harmonize it and enter the Gen Palace.\nLightly stir the celestial mechanism,\nAnd the true qi will gather in the Great Void at all times.\n\nAwakening to Qian and Kun as the crucible and vessel,\nThe cosmos inverts, following the root’s trace.\nThe Southern Aster moves into the Northern Aster’s position,\nThe Golden Crow flies into the Jade Toad’s palace.\n\nWithin the Great Yang, the Jade Hare is concealed,\nThe Great Yin naturally harmonizes and unites.\nAfter the first quarter, seek the medicine,\nBefore the last quarter, the qi settles evenly.\n\nBetween the two quarters is the time for gathering,\nBefore and after determine the life and death of the ancestral lineage.\nWho is the king, and who am I?\nWhen I float, you sink.\n\nHarmonize floating and sinking into one,\nBathing and concealment are all empty.\nKan and Li were never truly North and South,\nHow could Zhen and Dui be fixed to West and East?\n\nThe tender fragment enters the crucible without barrier,\nSeizing the Northern Dipper’s celestial wheel.\nStirring yin and yang into the palm,\nIn an instant, creation arises in the center.\n\nThese methods of Golden Liquor and Returned Elixir—\nWithout encountering an immortal master, do not forcefully pursue them.\nIf you truly gather the precelestial qi,\nThe sun and moon are captured in your hands.\n\nDay and night, they clash into one mass,\nNaturally, the roars of Dragon and Tiger resound.\nAt first, wind howls above and below,\nAs the wind gradually congeals, purple clouds form.\nLiving clouds overflow, obscuring the sun and moon—\nAt this moment, a storm like primordial chaos arises.\n\nSilently, the mists and clouds stir,\nWithin stillness, the crash of thunder is heard.\nSimurgh and phoenix, tortoise and serpent intertwine,\nGolden Crow and Jade Hare contend of their own accord.\n\nTiger retreats, Dragon coils, seeking the supreme treasure,\nMetal Lord and Maiden unite in marriage.\nThis time, mother and child reunite,\nSpirit and qi return to the root, merging with original truth.\n\nA single point—the primordial true seed—\nRefined into the cinnabar field, eternal spring.\nThe precelestial and preterrestrial return to one,\nBefore the separation of chaos, how could there be roots?\n\nGeneration naturally accords with sacred principle,\nGreen leaves and red blossoms—all renewed in one hue.\nWater and fire, above and below, ceaselessly irrigate,\nThe two qi congeal to birth the fetal infant.\n\nNaturally, the ancestral spirit is born in broad daylight,\nTranscending the mortal to enter the sacred, escaping life and death.\nAfter a hundred days of cultivation, no deficiency remains,\nBlood transforms into congealed cream, the body like silver.\nTrue qi steams without cold or heat,\nOnly then is one a lofty person of the Dao in the world.\n\nRefining with Qian Yang for three hundred days,\nSudden rain and whirlwind fill the Great Void.\nLightning flashes without number,\nThunder shakes the celestial pass, startling gods and ghosts.\n\nThe cosmos overturns, white snow flies,\nYin and yang invert—no night, no spring.\nThe bones are exchanged, yang restored, the body becomes indestructible,\nNine returns and seven reversions crystallize the true form.\n\nRefining with wisdom-fire for three hundred days,\nInner and outer brilliance reveals the true within.\nGathering forms it, scattering returns it to qi,\nReturning to the origin, merging with the Great Void.\n\nTransformations come and go, beyond human reckoning,\nPassed down mouth to mouth from ancient times to today.\nWithin it lies the principle of Heaven and Earth,\nThe immortals’ oral instructions are no empty discourse.\n\nMoreover, preserve it for three to five years,\nThrough countless kalpas without end.\nMastering the method of Golden Liquor and Returned Elixir,\nRiding simurghs and phoenixes, soaring freely.\nRefining the profound without obstruction,\nRoaming the three islands of Penglai at will.\n\nEven after a hundred million myriad kalpas,\nThe seas may dry, mountains may crumble, yet the countenance remains true.\nAlas for those in the world who cultivate the truth—\nAll differ from the Dao of Heavenly Immortals.\nThree thousand six hundred heterodox methods,\nCannot be exhaustively distinguished and expounded.\n\nThe Great Dao lies before one’s eyes, yet people do not recognize it,\nScattered among the myriad things and the human body.\nThe enlightened gather the precelestial qi,\nThunder roars through the night without pause.\n\nLightning flashes without number,\nThe two qi merge—how could they have form?\nShattering the celestial pass beyond compare,\nWind, rain, thunder, and lightning arise together.\nYin and yang invert, exchanging positions,\nBoundless celestial qi contend in glory.\n\nTiger retreats from the medicine furnace, vying for creation,\nDragon coils in the golden tripod, seeking ascent.\nThe Four Symbols and Five Phases return to Wu and Ji,\nRefining and forging the primordial essence.\n\nAuspicious qi blazes, the stars dim,\nCrimson light blazes, the sun darkens.\nYin and yang naturally advance and retreat,\nBefore and after the quarters, the truth is determined.\n\nRecognize the age of the Golden Elixir,\nDrawing and adding, a moment’s work.\nKnow the timing of the fetal fire,\nEach moment naturally ascends.\n\nTrue fire’s flames scorch the cosmos,\nHeaven and Earth above and below glow red.\nOne water, one fire—dividing the lines of the hexagram,\nOne ascent, one descent—settling floating and sinking.\nOne coming, one going—distinguishing guest and host,\nOne before, one after—establishing ruler and minister.\nOne yin, one yang—forming Heaven and Earth,\nOne firm, one yielding—naturally balanced.\n\nWinter and summer’s two qi mark the seasons,\nSpring and autumn’s two qi determine cold and warmth.\nComing and going, ascending and descending—without form,\nCircling day and night, each with its appointed time.\n\nDriving back the Dipper’s handle governs the Mystery Pass,\nRevolving the Celestial Pivot unites the myriad forms.\nIn a fleeting moment, dragon and tiger battle fiercely,\nThe two substances unite in an instant’s exchange.\nBearing clarity, they return to the Valley Cavity,\nIn primal chaos, distinction naturally emerges.\n\nThis is the method of wood and metal’s union,\nTrue lead, true mercury—the essence of Heaven and Earth.\nThis alone is the fire-tending secret of the Golden Elixir,\nWholly dependent on their union at the Cinnabar Spirit.\nA single chaos, the thousand-year medicine,\nEternal through ten thousand kalpas, an unending spring.\n\nWithin three thousand days, the living image congeals,\nIn a hundred days, the work divides the numinous transformations.\nAfter ten months, the pure yang body is refined,\nNaturally immune to cold and heat’s intrusion.\n\nWhen merit is complete and conduct perfected, the spirit-fetus forms,\nDrawing out the fetus, exchanging bones—returning to longevity.\nAuspicious qi and colored clouds veil the jade body,\nGreen luan and white cranes lead the way.\nJade maidens and golden lads hold the purple decree,\nThe heavenly immortals of all heavens welcome from left and right.\n\nGolden light shrouds the body, unseen by mortals,\nThe celestial music of the nine heavens resounds as one.\nRiding clouds and mist, they journey toward the Origin,\nSoaring upward to the Ninefold Empyrean.\n\nHere ends the *Tai Shang Dong Zhen Ningshen Xiuxing Jingjue*.",
