  "full_translation": "*The Supreme Mystery of the Eight Radiant Registers*\n\n**Title:** *The Supreme Mystery of the Eight Radiant Registers*. Author unknown, approximately composed during the Northern and Southern Dynasties. The first half contains the *Twenty-Four True Diagrams*, while the latter half comprises talismans of the immortals. One scroll. Base text from: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Methods* section of the *Dongzhen* Department.\n\n---\n\n**The Supreme Mystery of the Eight Radiant Registers**\n\nIn the first year of the Supreme August Era, on the second day of the ninth month, the Later Sage Lord Li journeyed to the Western River. Surveying the eight directions, he encountered the Primordial Celestial King riding an eight-radiance jade chariot, drawn by nine-hued dark dragons and three-pure flying clouds. Preceded by a procession of immortals, they bore flowered banners, while lions and white cranes chanted harmoniously, floating through the void to assemble above the Western River.\n\nLord Li bowed deeply and inquired of the Celestial King: \"Formerly, I received the celestial script and jade graphs of the twenty-four diagrams, yet though I grasped their text, I did not fathom their wondrous verses. Though diagrams and eulogies exist, their forms remain absent—practicing them in obscurity, their profound principles elude clarity. Now, encountering the Heavenly Worthy, my joy is beyond words. I humbly beseech your completion of this Way, that its truth may be perfected.\"\n\nThereupon, he was instructed to purify himself with a thousand-day fast, suffuse his body with five fragrances, and face east to ingest the talisman. Once his form and spirit were fully manifested, all would become thoroughly illuminated, and every doubt instantly resolved.\n\nLord Li bowed again, reverently accepting the celestial decree. Strictly adhering to the heavenly rites, he observed a thousand-day fast, faced east to ingest the talisman, and beheld the gods of the Three Regions and Eight Radiant Ones within his body. The twenty-four diagrams of golden script and jade graphs appeared luminously in the void, their radiant colors and brilliance boundless, their intricate details naturally unfolding.\n\nAt that moment, he summoned the immortal overseer of the diagrams to render them in illustration. Golden script and purple characters, jade texts and cinnabar verses—thus were the sounds formed. From the Supreme Nine-Light Perfected Lady of the Upper Prime of the Southern Culmen, the Eastern and Western Twin Flowers, the Northern and Southern Perfected Lords, the immortals of the Five Peaks, and the Pure Void Perfected Ones, all received the true texts. These were the very diagrams drawn by the Later Sage, each duly appended.\n\n---\n\n**Diagram of the Perfected One Bathing in the Eastern Well**\n*First True Qi of the Upper Region*\nThe Celestial

The body radiates luminous splendor, and the Eight Radiant Spirits ascend upon clouds, bearing one aloft in flight.\n\n*The Jade Purity Seven Treasures Illustrated Charts of Divine Immortals* encompasses the Three Eights’ Division of True Qi:\n---\nSoftly, softly, atop the Three Clarities,\nPerfection congeals in the Great Canopy of Heaven.\nJade groves on the Emerald Mystery Terrace,\nSun and moon gleam in the Numinous Pavilion.\nFlying immortals in verdant qi,\nRiding the radiance, trailing purple mists.\nLushly they emerge through clouds,\nIn throngs arrayed as numinous immortals.\nCarefree in the Seven Treasures Grove,\nFive hues warm gold and silver.\nDonning echoes, the assembly of perfected beings gathers,\nNuminous hymns celebrate the myriad spirits.\nWith concentrated intent on the Three Eights’ Radiance,\nOne strides beyond to ascend the Gate of Heaven.\n---\n\nIn the first year of the Vermilion Brightness, on the first *yin* day of the first month, at the hour of noon, the heavens shone with fourfold brilliance, purple clouds coiled through the sky, the Eight Assemblies of the Empyrean rejoiced, numinous winds swept away dust, sun and moon exhaled radiance, the five stars poured forth their essences, heaven and earth were steeped in twilight mists, fragrant blossoms rained down, rivers and seas stilled, mountains and peaks concealed their vapors. The Five Sufferings were all dissolved, the Three Paths released their souls, the Nine Dark Realms ceased their torments, the gates of eternal night swung open, the deaf and blind regained hearing and sight, the Six Afflictions were all healed, the Earth Treasury unsealed, gold and jade revealed their forms, white bones quickened with qi, decayed remains returned to life, dragon scales leapt and danced, birds and beasts soared in joy. The Three Realms knew enduring bliss, humans and spirits rejoiced as one.\n\nOn this day of great celebration, the myriad kalpas were renewed. The Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning extended his hospitality upon the Jade Terrace. In the Vermilion Brightness Heaven, upon the Southern Fire Peak, within the Cinnabar Numinous Grotto Palace, he unfurled the Five Colors, fashioned an altar of yellow gold, and spread a foundation of white silver. The Seven Treasures proclaimed the numinous, and he transmitted the *Cavern Mystery Golden Writ of the Purple Script and Vermilion Chapters of Spontaneous Numinous Charts*, along with the Twenty-Four Perfected and the Three Divisions’ Radiant Spirits, the Heavenly Immortals, Flying Immortals, Divine Immortals, and Earthbound Immortals, their legions of troops and mounts, to the Supreme Peerless Dao Lord. Following the solemn protocols and mysterious statutes, he illuminated the true ordinances and scriptures, initiating ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine individuals whose names were inscribed in gold, whose characters were arrayed across the heavens—those destined to ascend as immortals.\n\nAt the conclusion of the great kalpic cycle, the texts shall be gathered and returned to the Seven Treasures Mysterious Terrace of the Great Canopy’s Purple Tenuity Palace. Now, as the Three Caverns govern the kalpic flow and the Numinous Treasure’s Lower Teaching prevails, the vacancies among the celestial offices of the ascending immortals must first be filled by those of middling worth to complete the ranks of the Black Emperor’s Perfected of the Nine Heavens.\n\nThe Master of the Northern Peak, Lord Ju, formerly received the teachings in the *Xu* year, on the thirteenth day of the ninth month, at the Southern Grotto of the Central Heaven, from the Master of the Central Peak, Lord Yang. As he was destined to initiate others, those whose names were preordained in the golden registers and jade records, whose natures aligned with perfection, were to be selected to fill the celestial offices, traversing the Eight Poles and arriving from the midst of the Void.\n\nNow, the destined life of the Vermilion Emperor’s Perfected, so-and-so, born in the *bing-wu* year, whose fate is governed by the Southern Emperor of the Cinnabar Heaven, born in the seventh month, imbued with the primordial qi of the Plain Heaven’s destiny, whose bones and fate align with the immortal perfected, is to fill the office of Second-Rank Immortal of the Cavern Mystery. In this year, on such-and-such a day of such-and-such a month, within such-and-such a heaven, in accordance with the ancient ordinances of the former master’s luminous and true great method, he ascends the Yellow Altar. The Seven Treasures secure the numinous, the Five Colors attest to his immortality, and he is initiated into the boundless *Spontaneous Numinous Treasure Cavern Mystery Golden Writ*, the *Purple Script and Vermilion Chapters of Jade Text*, the *Charts of the Twenty-Four Perfected and Three Eights’ Divisions*, and the divine immortals’ mounts.\n\nHaving received the great method, he is acclaimed by the Three Realms. The numinous demons safeguard his clarity, his person traverses the Five Paths, his name is inscribed in the Golden Tablets and Jade Records of the Purple Palace. His rank ascends to Perfected Immortal, and he roams freely, clad in the celestial regalia of feathered robes. He ascends upon clouds, borne by dragon-drawn chariots, preceded by the Three Sevens’ colored standards, heralded by phoenix songs, followed by the Heavenly Chime. The Five Emperors open the Way, the Supreme Ultimate attends his chariot, immortal youths and jade maidens scatter blossoms and burn incense, jeweled canopies trail their tassels, encircling and protecting his journey. Harmonious qi fills him to abundance, and he ascends to the immortal palaces.\n\nHe must observe proper conduct in movement and stillness, guard his speech, and be vigilant in his actions. He must cast aside all worldly entanglements, sever extraneous thoughts, calm his mind, and embrace silence, focusing his will solely upon the method. He must not allow turbidity, nor incite others to distraction, lest he disrupt the true qi. In all his actions, he must practice great compassion, broadly delivering all beings, ensuring the nation’s peace and the people’s prosperity, unifying the Four Seas in tranquility. His seven generations of ancestors and parents shall all ascend and be delivered, his person shall enter luminosity, and he shall be reborn early among humankind. When the great kalpic cycle turns, he shall ascend together to the Supreme Clarity, carefree in the Seven Treasures Grove of the Golden Portals.\n\nThose not yet initiated as immortals must complete seven years of the method’s practice, until their celestial qi is fully prepared. When the celestial signs proclaim that one’s destiny aligns with perfection, the transmission shall proceed in accordance with the ordinances.

      "translated_text": "*The Supreme Mystery of the Eight Radiant Registers*\n\n**Title:** *The Supreme Mystery of the Eight Radiant Registers*. Author unknown, approximately composed during the Northern and Southern Dynasties. The first half contains the *Twenty-Four True Diagrams*, while the latter half comprises talismans of the immortals. One scroll. Base text from: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Methods* section of the *Dongzhen* Department.\n\n---\n\n**The Supreme Mystery of the Eight Radiant Registers**\n\nIn the first year of the Supreme August Era, on the second day of the ninth month, the Later Sage Lord Li journeyed to the Western River. Surveying the eight directions, he encountered the Primordial Celestial King riding an eight-radiance jade chariot, drawn by nine-hued dark dragons and three-pure flying clouds. Preceded by a procession of immortals, they bore flowered banners, while lions and white cranes chanted harmoniously, floating through the void to assemble above the Western River.\n\nLord Li bowed deeply and inquired of the Celestial King: \"Formerly, I received the celestial script and jade graphs of the twenty-four diagrams, yet though I grasped their text, I did not fathom their wondrous verses. Though diagrams and eulogies exist, their forms remain absent—practicing them in obscurity, their profound principles elude clarity. Now, encountering the Heavenly Worthy, my joy is beyond words. I humbly beseech your completion of this Way, that its truth may be perfected.\"\n\nThereupon, he was instructed to purify himself with a thousand-day fast, suffuse his body with five fragrances, and face east to ingest the talisman. Once his form and spirit were fully manifested, all would become thoroughly illuminated, and every doubt instantly resolved.\n\nLord Li bowed again, reverently accepting the celestial decree. Strictly adhering to the heavenly rites, he observed a thousand-day fast, faced east to ingest the talisman, and beheld the gods of the Three Regions and Eight Radiant Ones within his body. The twenty-four diagrams of golden script and jade graphs appeared luminously in the void, their radiant colors and brilliance boundless, their intricate details naturally unfolding.\n\nAt that moment, he summoned the immortal overseer of the diagrams to render them in illustration. Golden script and purple characters, jade texts and cinnabar verses—thus were the sounds formed. From the Supreme Nine-Light Perfected Lady of the Upper Prime of the Southern Culmen, the Eastern and Western Twin Flowers, the Northern and Southern Perfected Lords, the immortals of the Five Peaks, and the Pure Void Perfected Ones, all received the true texts. These were the very diagrams drawn by the Later Sage, each duly appended.\n\n---\n\n**Diagram of the Perfected One Bathing in the Eastern Well**\n*First True Qi of the Upper Region*\nThe Celestial River pours into the Eastern Well,\nStone radiance and the essence of the Water Mother.\nA halo brushes the numinous brilliance,\nDark splendor gleams in lofty clarity.\nThe Primordial Beginning parts the layered night,\nHeavenly beings follow the moon’s birth.\nBathing atop the Orchid Pool,\nDragons bear the long-stemmed vase.\nGolden youths scatter fragrant blossoms,\nJade maidens stream the Five Stars.\nCrowns and sashes laved in jade fluid,\nRefining and transmuting the forms of the Five Immortals.\nTheir bodies fragrant, myriad spirits descend,\nRiding the radiance to ascend the heights of purity.\n\n**Diagram of the True Forms of the Five Peaks Immortals**\n*Second True Qi of the Upper Region*\nWondrous is the Dao of the Primordial Beginning,\nThe Five Numinous Ones unfold the true script.\nAbove, it opens the Dragon Han kalpa,\nResplendent, the Three Radiant Ones divide.\nTen divisions of flying celestial texts\nSecurely settle the gods of the Five Thearchs.\nThe numinous peaks uphold the Dark Palace,\nBillowing and surging, they exhale treasure clouds.\nAbove dwells the qi of deathlessness,\nSprouting buds to refine the Five Immortals.\nJade mushrooms bestowed within the dark,\nTheir bodies pure, naturally fragrant.\nWith concentrated thought, the lofty numinous descends,\nConsorting with the Lords of the Supreme Emperor.\n\n**Diagram of the Eight Histories Unlocking the Numinous**\n*Third True Qi of the Upper Region*\nThree radiant ones exhale numinous blossoms,\nDazzling, the Eight Gates open.\nWithin abides the spirit of wisdom,\nClad in flying celestial robes.\nThe Eight Histories convey the numinous qi,\nJade talismans penetrate the subtle and profound.\nTreasure clouds reflect jade graphs,\nMighty beasts shake celestial might.\nResplendent, the Eight Assemblies’ palaces,\nIn profusion, numinous beings take flight.\nWith concentrated thought, summon the true qi,\nFive talismans generate radiant splendor.\nThe Eight Radiant Ones wield jade tablets,\nAscending the void to enter the Purple Tenuity.\n\n**Diagram of the Six Jia Immortals Communing with the Numinous**\n*Fourth True Qi of the Upper Region*\nNuminous palace flying celestial maidens,\nSix Perfected Ones feast in Eternal Yang.\nEmbracing the sun, bearing the bright moon,\nThey tread upward toward the Three Dawn Lights.\nCommuning with the numinous, they fathom the subtle,\nPenetratingly observing the ten directions’ clarity.\nSummoning the natural kitchens,\nThe Five Mushrooms and Six Palaces flourish.\nTransforming and refining the myriad spirits,\nTheir forms divide, their true countenances change.\nTreading the void, they pace the Dark Capital,\nSoaring high to enter the Empty Union.\nAt times descending as golden aurora beings,\nLoosening their robes in the Three-Pure Chambers.\nHolding contracts, they wield flying canopies,\nCarefree, they ascend the Jade Capital.\n\n**Diagram of the Nine Palaces and Purple Chambers**\n*Fifth True Qi of the Upper Region*\nPurple chambers reflect lofty purity,\nPalaces and halls mutually support one another.\nLayered mists entwine sun and moon,\nFlying immortals shade the Great Void.\nThe utmost Perfected and Great Sages,\nSerene, chant the feathered scriptures.\nOpening salvation through the kalpas of all heavens,\nAs countless as the Ganges’ sands, they complete one cycle.\nThe Nine-Five firmly secures numinous destiny,\nEternally preserving heaven and earth’s abode.\nWith concentrated thought, how could one be distant?\nThe Purple Palace engenders my body.\n\n**Diagram of the Primordial Beginning and Supreme Clarity**\n*Sixth True Qi of the Upper Region*\nSupreme Clarity knows no bounds,\nAzure qi billows in the Purple Tenuity.\nNuminous winds swiftly bear treasures,\nHow lush the forest of jade trees!\nPurple phoenixes sing on long branches,\nDragon-unicorns intertwine in flight.\nThe Supreme surveys the ten directions,\nAll heavens array their dharma robes.\nWandering, they circle the palace city,\nThrice encircling, the long night opens.\nIf one can contemplate the numinous qi,\nOne shall naturally ride the radiance in flight.\n\n**Diagram of the Perfected Dao’s Primal Chaos**\n*Seventh True Qi of the Upper Region*\nVast and boundless, the Primordial Beginning’s dawn,\nPrimal chaos’ qi yet undivided.\nThree hues transform within the void,\nRevolving and merging like auspicious clouds.\nFrom the dark and obscure, true radiance arises,\nResplendent, the numinous script unfolds.\nBrilliantly, the long night opens,\nEstablishing the roots of heaven and earth.\nThe wondrous true qi of spontaneity,\nPure and abiding, qi endures.\nCirculating through the Great Nine Realms,\nOpening salvation through the gates of all heavens.\n\n**Diagram of the Western Ascent and Preservation Register**\n*Eighth True Qi of the Upper Region*\nRiding the swift numinous qi,\nMounting the radiance to ascend the Western Palace.\nArriving at the Jade That Realm,\nTen thousand chariots follow in attendance.\nSpirits and demons bow in submission,\nCelestial Kings all surrender in homage.\nDividing gold to cast the orthodox Dharma,\nThe world reveres the King of Dao and Virtue.\nThus bestowing the orthodox true qi,\nDistinctly named to deliver one region.\nAt that time, a Dao-endowed world arose,\nCalled the Hall of Blessed Virtue.\n\nThe *Numinous Treasure Diagram of the Immortals* states: The Eight True Spirit Diagrams of the Upper Region, through the primordial qi of the Grotto-Heavens and the Primordial Beginning, transform and engender the Eight Radiant Upper Perfected Ones. Within the human body, they bring forth the Upper Prime’s generative qi. With concentrated thought within, the Eight Perfected manifest their forms—thousands of chariots and ten thousand riders, conveying radiant clouds to bear one upward in ascent.",

      "translated_text": "The Eighth Radiant Spirit of the Lower Prime’s Right Yin is named Embracing Clarity, styled Daosheng, of blue-green-yellow-white color, bearing the Grotto-Spirit Lower Prime’s Eighth Radiant Numinous Talisman, the Eighth Radiant Spirit of the Division.\n\nThe *Illustrated Charts of Divine Immortals* states: The Numinous Treasure Grotto-Spirit Lower Prime’s Eighth Radiant Numinous Talisman, by virtue of the Eighth Radiant Spirit of the Division’s perfection, is enshrined within the Lower Prime Palace of the human body. After ingesting it for eight years, the Eight Radiant Spirits of the Lower Prime manifest in form, nurturing essence and replenishing qi, refining marrow and coagulating perfection. The body radiates luminous splendor, and the Eight Radiant Spirits ascend upon clouds, bearing one aloft in flight.\n\n*The Jade Purity Seven Treasures Illustrated Charts of Divine Immortals* encompasses the Three Eights’ Division of True Qi:\n---\nSoftly, softly, atop the Three Clarities,\nPerfection congeals in the Great Canopy of Heaven.\nJade groves on the Emerald Mystery Terrace,\nSun and moon gleam in the Numinous Pavilion.\nFlying immortals in verdant qi,\nRiding the radiance, trailing purple mists.\nLushly they emerge through clouds,\nIn throngs arrayed as numinous immortals.\nCarefree in the Seven Treasures Grove,\nFive hues warm gold and silver.\nDonning echoes, the assembly of perfected beings gathers,\nNuminous hymns celebrate the myriad spirits.\nWith concentrated intent on the Three Eights’ Radiance,\nOne strides beyond to ascend the Gate of Heaven.\n---\n\nIn the first year of the Vermilion Brightness, on the first *yin* day of the first month, at the hour of noon, the heavens shone with fourfold brilliance, purple clouds coiled through the sky, the Eight Assemblies of the Empyrean rejoiced, numinous winds swept away dust, sun and moon exhaled radiance, the five stars poured forth their essences, heaven and earth were steeped in twilight mists, fragrant blossoms rained down, rivers and seas stilled, mountains and peaks concealed their vapors. The Five Sufferings were all dissolved, the Three Paths released their souls, the Nine Dark Realms ceased their torments, the gates of eternal night swung open, the deaf and blind regained hearing and sight, the Six Afflictions were all healed, the Earth Treasury unsealed, gold and jade revealed their forms, white bones quickened with qi, decayed remains returned to life, dragon scales leapt and danced, birds and beasts soared in joy. The Three Realms knew enduring bliss, humans and spirits rejoiced as one.\n\nOn this day of great celebration, the myriad kalpas were renewed. The Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning extended his hospitality upon the Jade Terrace. In the Vermilion Brightness Heaven, upon the Southern Fire Peak, within the Cinnabar Numinous Grotto Palace, he unfurled the Five Colors, fashioned an altar of yellow gold, and spread a foundation of white silver. The Seven Treasures proclaimed the numinous, and he transmitted the *Cavern Mystery Golden Writ of the Purple Script and Vermilion Chapters of Spontaneous Numinous Charts*, along with the Twenty-Four Perfected and the Three Divisions’ Radiant Spirits, the Heavenly Immortals, Flying Immortals, Divine Immortals, and Earthbound Immortals, their legions of troops and mounts, to the Supreme Peerless Dao Lord. Following the solemn protocols and mysterious statutes, he illuminated the true ordinances and scriptures, initiating ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine individuals whose names were inscribed in gold, whose characters were arrayed across the heavens—those destined to ascend as immortals.\n\nAt the conclusion of the great kalpic cycle, the texts shall be gathered and returned to the Seven Treasures Mysterious Terrace of the Great Canopy’s Purple Tenuity Palace. Now, as the Three Caverns govern the kalpic flow and the Numinous Treasure’s Lower Teaching prevails, the vacancies among the celestial offices of the ascending immortals must first be filled by those of middling worth to complete the ranks of the Black Emperor’s Perfected of the Nine Heavens.\n\nThe Master of the Northern Peak, Lord Ju, formerly received the teachings in the *Xu* year, on the thirteenth day of the ninth month, at the Southern Grotto of the Central Heaven, from the Master of the Central Peak, Lord Yang. As he was destined to initiate others, those whose names were preordained in the golden registers and jade records, whose natures aligned with perfection, were to be selected to fill the celestial offices, traversing the Eight Poles and arriving from the midst of the Void.\n\nNow, the destined life of the Vermilion Emperor’s Perfected, so-and-so, born in the *bing-wu* year, whose fate is governed by the Southern Emperor of the Cinnabar Heaven, born in the seventh month, imbued with the primordial qi of the Plain Heaven’s destiny, whose bones and fate align with the immortal perfected, is to fill the office of Second-Rank Immortal of the Cavern Mystery. In this year, on such-and-such a day of such-and-such a month, within such-and-such a heaven, in accordance with the ancient ordinances of the former master’s luminous and true great method, he ascends the Yellow Altar. The Seven Treasures secure the numinous, the Five Colors attest to his immortality, and he is initiated into the boundless *Spontaneous Numinous Treasure Cavern Mystery Golden Writ*, the *Purple Script and Vermilion Chapters of Jade Text*, the *Charts of the Twenty-Four Perfected and Three Eights’ Divisions*, and the divine immortals’ mounts.\n\nHaving received the great method, he is acclaimed by the Three Realms. The numinous demons safeguard his clarity, his person traverses the Five Paths, his name is inscribed in the Golden Tablets and Jade Records of the Purple Palace. His rank ascends to Perfected Immortal, and he roams freely, clad in the celestial regalia of feathered robes. He ascends upon clouds, borne by dragon-drawn chariots, preceded by the Three Sevens’ colored standards, heralded by phoenix songs, followed by the Heavenly Chime. The Five Emperors open the Way, the Supreme Ultimate attends his chariot, immortal youths and jade maidens scatter blossoms and burn incense, jeweled canopies trail their tassels, encircling and protecting his journey. Harmonious qi fills him to abundance, and he ascends to the immortal palaces.\n\nHe must observe proper conduct in movement and stillness, guard his speech, and be vigilant in his actions. He must cast aside all worldly entanglements, sever extraneous thoughts, calm his mind, and embrace silence, focusing his will solely upon the method. He must not allow turbidity, nor incite others to distraction, lest he disrupt the true qi. In all his actions, he must practice great compassion, broadly delivering all beings, ensuring the nation’s peace and the people’s prosperity, unifying the Four Seas in tranquility. His seven generations of ancestors and parents shall all ascend and be delivered, his person shall enter luminosity, and he shall be reborn early among humankind. When the great kalpic cycle turns, he shall ascend together to the Supreme Clarity, carefree in the Seven Treasures Grove of the Golden Portals.\n\nThose not yet initiated as immortals must complete seven years of the method’s practice, until their celestial qi is fully prepared.
