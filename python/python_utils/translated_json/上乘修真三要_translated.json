Whether in substance or function, whether provisional or real, all must harmonize with the fundamental principle—this is the first truth.\n\nWithin the jade crucible, the fire is kindled; the spirit gathers, and the celestial wheel turns. Floating clouds are swept away, and thoughts align with the cyclical flow of *zi* and *wu*. As *qian* breathes and *kun* dissolves, this mirrors the workings of the sun and moon.\n\nHeaven endures, earth persists—who would dare idle and squander time? A single moment is worth ten thousand taels of gold.\n\nThose who attain the Dao traverse the world, yet struggle to find its manifestation in the daily lives of common folk. Only when the subtlest mysteries are fully realized, when both medicine and illness are transcended, does one arrive at the great path of cultivation.\n\n---\n\n**Three Methods Verse**\n\nRecognize the rootless bandits—\nthese thieves are called the mind.\nWith a great shout, halt them;\nthe three methods are seized as one.\n\nHold firm at the perfect juncture,\nand both sides grow strong.\nLift and strike at the heart—\nthe three methods are forgotten as one.\n\n---\n\nFour hooves race, the nature unturned;\nthe herdboy departs, and the horse’s thieving mind must be guarded.\nSever the fetters, lock the shackles—\nonce the mind strays, intent is hard to reclaim.\nAmong ten thousand, few can grasp the reins and rein it in.\n\nThis horse’s temperament is wild,\nneighing and bolting east and west.\nThe herdboy chases behind,\nyet the thieving mind remains unsecured.\n\nAt the first moment of leisure, release it—\nlead it south of the village, unaware of the horse’s fright.\nA single thought sends it galloping east or west,\nin an instant, it covers two or three leagues.\nIts form stumbles blindly into deep chasms.\n\nBound in the wilds,\nthe herdboy watches in hunger and vigil.\nFrom afar, it neighs repeatedly—\nseize it and never let it roam free.\n\nThis horse is so hard to capture—\nthough hobbled at neck and hooves, bound fast,\nit cannot be held in check.\nIts heart still unsecured, it roars and bolts again.\nTighten the halter, fasten the fetters,\nyet its wild heart races with the wind,\nturning its back on its true home.\nOnce gone, it vanishes without trace,\nlost to the ends of the earth.\n\nFor its reckless intent, thirty lashes are ever due.\nDo not mistake it for a fine steed—\nits willful mind cannot be trusted.\nA single thought follows the wind,\nand where can even the wise find it?\nOnly when tamed does clarity come.\n\nA stubborn horse is hard to teach,\nrearing against the reins, biting its master.\nSeize it, deliver thirty lashes—\nthen, with hands subdued, truth is revealed.\nBind its head, apply the whip without respite,\nhold fast the rope’s end,\nand frequently strike its back.\nTether it in an idle place,\nand the herdboy’s watch becomes natural.\n\nThe herdboy’s grip must be twofold:\none hand wields the whip upon its back,\nthe other reins its heart with intent.\nYet even the herdboy cannot secure its will—\ngoodness does not come naturally.\nBareback, without saddle or bridle,\nas soon as it is led to feed,\nit snaps the purple silk reins,\nkicks at the trough, and defies its master—\nits wild heart utterly unruly.\n\nDo not regard it with a casual glance.\nIt is no true beast—\ndo not mistake it for a fine horse.\nA moment’s carelessness lets it slip,\nand both households suffer the loss.\n\nIts rampant, roaring nature races far,\nswift as flight.\nGive it thirty lashes—\nthen, with hands subdued, clarity comes.\nBe single-minded and firm, not fierce or stubborn.\nTighten the bit, keep watch without rest.\nIf the herdboy’s care slackens,\nboth will be lost in confusion.\n\nDo not employ this horse as a fine steed.\nThough constantly tethered, it is never fed,\nridden all day with the whip.\nStarved past midnight,\nits true nature stirs faintly—\na fleeting joy, a hint of pleasure.\n\nThis horse’s nature is base,\nyet it harbors the heart of a thousand-mile steed.\nIf the herdboy plays carelessly,\nletting it slip from his grasp,\nit is hardest to retrieve.\nLet it run free, call it back—pay it no mind.\nAbandon it in the wilds,\nleave it to its own devices.\nWith a flick of the sleeve, stroll away humming,\nthen reclaim it and return it to its rightful home.\n\nWith sincere resolve, wave farewell to the evening’s song.\nKeep constant watch, ever vigilant—\nthe herdboy leads it to the roadside.\nStanding firm, not a step astray,\nhe ensures the fine horse’s nature remains untamed no more.\n\nWild grasses and cold springs are its only companions,\nwild grasses its sole companion,\ncold springs its nearest neighbor.\nThe fine horse stands by the stream,\nwhile the herdboy’s true nature finds joy.\nWith raised brows and bright eyes, what awaits?\n\nLeisurely, beyond worldly cares, he roams free,\nplayfully guiding it without restraint or pride.\nVast and clear, utterly at ease,\ntranscending even a single blade of straw.\n\nYet in an instant, the fine horse’s nature cannot be secured—\nthe willful steed strays day after day,\nwhen will the herdboy find rest?\nSeize it, never let it slip,\nhold fast, and peace comes naturally.\n\nSteal no idle moments, set no snares.\nThe herdboy’s song lingers, unceasing,\nas he rides alone beyond worldly cares.\nFlowing waters, empty mountains, clouds his companions—\nreturning, his heart is clear, joy without sorrow.\n\nLeading it home, turning back,\nhe sings alone in the evening,\nsighing at how fleeting time is.\nWith a wave of his hand, he returns to the woods and springs,\ncarefree beyond the world, letting years drift by.\n\nThe black horse with a silver head—its nature is no lie.\nBorn with a good and gentle disposition,\nit does not betray the herdboy’s heart.\nLeaning idly against a withered pine,\nhe hums in carefree ease.\n\nThe herdboy dances and sings, ever close by—\nleading it to a cold pool to bathe,\nits form gleaming, free of grime.\nThe herdboy dances and sings,\nwhile the fine horse follows closely.\nFor a moment, body and mind find rest.\n\nThe fine horse takes the reins,\nready to repay its master’s kindness.\n\nThe Five Lights truly shine bright,\ntranscendent, standing alone above the crowd.\nLonging to sing afar in joyous heights—\na red horse crosses the western river,\nthe herdboy stands on the bank.\n\nHold fast, do not let it pass,\nstrike it dead—what doubt remains?\nYet fear it may not be reined in when full.\nThe black horse gallops unrestrained,\nthe white ox is penned day by day.\n\nAt dawn, the herdboy ascends to the Purple Palace,\na pure breeze scatters across the sky.\nGradually, this beast settles into its true nature—\nthe white horse’s temper is gentle,\nthe herdboy need not rush.\n\nBeneath the clear wind and bright moon,\nhe sits alone, refining the elixir’s formula.\nDo not indulge in play—the horse’s heart is a thief.\nTether it in the formless to guard the unempty,\nlet go and gather, naturally inexhaustible.\n\nHow could a fine steed hinder a noble’s ambition?\nOnly for the blue-maned one to gather the Five Lights.\nAgainst its will, the fetters break the hoof’s lock.\nAt leisure, beyond the world, it dances in spring’s breeze,\nlifting the effortless, one finds self-exhaustion.\n\nThe Milky Way does not hinder flowing water’s passage,\nthe herdboy just then seeks the *Can Tong Qi*.\nAll prior efforts are undone, both hanging in vain.\nLocked to the Pillar of Original Fate,\nnever left idle for a moment.\n\nStarved until its coat is scorched and thin,\nlet it go—no need to watch.\nCast it aside in the wilds, no need to look back.\nThe white horse is tied to the numinous terrace,\nthe herdboy finds great joy.\n\nYou do not see it led away,\nshedding its form, rising from the dust.\nIdly gazing at green waters and blue mountains,\nthe horse grazes on ravine grass,\nthe herdboy rests in leisure.\n\nAt dusk, he returns to his old home,\npointing afar to the moon on the horizon.\nWhen weary, he wanders alone to rest in the cliffs,\nin weariness, he refines the elixir’s script,\nat leisure, he dances a tune.\n\nA long laugh beyond the wind’s reach,\nthe herdboy attains freedom.\nSitting, the red reeds grow two or three stalks.\nThe white horse with a blue mane—its Dao is not empty,\nriding it, he seeks the *Can Tong Qi* beyond the world.\n\nHe intends to take a single drop of Kun’s essence,\nand gather it into Qian’s treasury of mysteries.\n\nThe herdboy now knows the noble nature of the gentleman,\nmoonlight locks the clouded stream—\nthe herdboy dances and plays his flute.\nLift it swiftly, then set it down:\na thunderclap on level ground.\n\nBeneath the clear shade, waters murmur.\nThe herdboy sits in solemn stillness,\nthe horse stands beneath the pines.\nA woodcutter steps forward to ask,\nthe herdboy knows nothing at all.\n\nUnfettered, free—no one inquires.\nThe fine steed rests in the forest,\nthe herdboy plays his flute beneath the crag.\nCarefree, unbound by any realm,\nhis heart withered, his nature like ashes.\nYet joy fills his face with laughter.\n\nThe fine steed rides the wind away,\nlightly grasped, it appears before him.\nBeyond the crag’s edge, free and at ease,\nthe herdboy sleeps beneath the moon.\nOnce he saved the master by dropping the reins—\nthis horse’s nature is gentle as silk,\nthe herdboy guards the natural Way.\nOriginally, there was not a single thing,\nyet in non-being, the body finds wholeness.\nVirtue is good, the tranquil Dao not empty.\n\nThe mind-steed is fundamentally empty,\nforced to gallop west and east.\nLift it, then strike it all away—\nthe bright moon keeps company with the clear wind.\n\nSongs and dances of ten thousand stanzas, boundless beauty,\nthe herdboy’s song and dance most refined.\nIdle, idle, idleness—joy without sorrow.\nHaving traversed the ends of the earth, delighting in no-self,\nhe gathers it up and hangs it on the moon’s tip.\nFrom ancient times, this could be the family’s foundational style.\n\nSnowy peaks and Song winds move,\nthe cold pool’s moon congeals.\nGreen crags and immortal osmanthus flourish,\nbeyond the world, wild cranes cry.\n\nThus nurtured, his nature becomes pure and harmonious.\nCarefree, the lone wanderer delights at the world’s edge,\nbeyond the clouds, serene and unpressured.\nThe pivot-song’s melody pierces the clear sky,\nhis dancing sleeves find heaven and earth too narrow.\n\nThe boy rejoices, free to roam.\nWhen the time comes, he laughs and dances in the spring wind,\nemerging from being, entering non-being—unhindered by emptiness.\nWithin the cave, the true wind is worthy of emulation,\nat heaven’s edge, the great perfect clarity congeals.\n\nStrolling at ease, he roams the scenes beyond the world.\nThe white horse and the herdboy—\nthe awakened one’s intent knows no bounds.\nThe wondrous principle of true emptiness,\nsuddenly reveals the clarity of nature.\n\nAlone before the green crags and blue pines,\nthe herdboy embodies the natural,\nmoonlight locks the azure sky.\nIn the thatched hall’s pure stillness,\neach line resonates with profound mystery.\n\nThe herdboy at ease, delighting before the crags,\nsearching for herbs, the busy boy rests,\nthe white horse idly bears the scriptures.\nThe intent of the western journey’s eastern crossing,\nerases traces—no connection remains.\nThe guest views poetry and books, forgetting the years.\n\nSoundless, pure song brings joy,\nidly chanting the gates of all wonders.\nThree strikes—all done,\nbeneath pines and bamboo, a single pot of purity.\n\nEmptiness of nature—no need to capture the mind-steed.\nGuard the heart-ape to stillness,\nthe boy rests naturally, no longer wandering.\nThe elixir complete, he knows creation’s workings—\nbeyond things, what further cultivation is there?\nForget the mechanism, sever the heart-ape’s grip.\n\nBefore the vast, bright moon,\nstrike the center with a single fist.\nWhere the true countenance remains unchanged,\nthere lies the valley spirit’s wholeness.\n\nNow seize the nature at hand—\nnature abides in tranquility,\ndelighting in the Dao without end.\nWithin the crucible, jade-like essence congeals,\nhung upon the osmanthus branch.\nSleep without worry, waking without entanglement.\n\nJoy and play reside within,\ngathered to seek the *Can Tong Qi*.\nThe herdboy’s nature is natural,\nmoonlight locks the emerald sky.\nIn the thatched hall’s pure clarity,\neach phrase resonates with subtle mystery.\n\nThe seven returns forge the elixir’s form,\nno need for nine-fold refinement’s work.\nIn motion, the eight purities’ subtle principle—\ncleaving open primal chaos,\nchiseling through heaven and earth.\n\nRecognize the \"nothing-yet-all,\"\nthe family’s inherent Way.\nFollow the constant, then reverse to wield expedience.\nNo need to count the passing years,\nthe twin gates never left idle.\n\nLuminous, bright, and all-pervading,\ndreamless, one arrives at Dengye.\nSlanting sunlight and clear wind near the horizon’s edge,\ncranes dance to the elixir’s discourse,\nthe boy’s song soars with wondrous intent.\n\nFacing each other, few words spoken,\nthe bright moon illumines the toad palace.\nWell met, to share tea with the mountain boy.\nDrinking alone, Zhao Zhou’s tea,\nsleeves brushed, one steps into mist and rosy clouds.\n\nBeyond the world, no companions sing,\nthe mortal realm clamors like hemp.\nBy the stream, pride cast off, the self-made fortress crumbles—\nclapping hands, laughter rings out,\nbeyond the world, a wild crane arrives.\n\nWhere the herdboy rests in leisure,\nanother Penglai unfolds.\nWildflowers and meadow grass are my home.\nAwakening to Lü and Huang’s root,\noutwardly, the wildflower countryside.\nAt ease, wandering in dreams,\nwithin the gourd, sun and moon stretch long.\n\nTruly, there is some sincerity,\nthe fine steed has no inherent nature,\nthe herdboy’s form is naturally whole.\nOriginally, not a single thing exists—\nwhere is there no peace?\n\nIn carefree ease, delighting in mist and rosy clouds.\nGreen waters and azure hills,\nimmortals within the misty grotto.\nPushing aside the moon at the sky’s edge,\nbelow the ravine, a sky of clarity.\n\nA hundred years of life, all a fleeting dream—\nsleeves swept, ascending the blue peak,\nstrolling idly, embracing the natural.\nGathering one thing,\nsetting down a gourd of heaven.\nPassing days with hempen cloth and green threads.\n\nBeneath the clear wind and bright moon,\nwhen will the spring breeze ever cease?\nThe jade-green pool’s limpid lines,\nall idle words of leisurely folk.\n\nThe heart like withered wood, cold ashes—\nthe herdboy’s nature at ease,\nthe ravine’s waters murmuring.\nIdly observing the world beyond,\nmountains remain mountains as ever.\nWithout effort, the flute dances on its own.\n\nLifting a thousand kinds of being,\nsetting down, all becomes one nothing.\nSleeves swaying, stepping beyond the world,\nalone astride a solitary wheel.\n\nThe swift steed reined in, resting beneath the crag,\na gibbon frolics,\nthe herdboy rides backward on the ox.\nCaptured and made to follow,\never joyful, endless delight.\nWell met, to dwell secluded before the peaks.\n\nThe three realms and ten directions manifest,\nthe clear wind turns at hand.\nAll grasping and releasing done,\nawakened, one lets go a single thread.\n\nJoyous, possessing an unshaken nature—\ntoying with being within nothingness,\nrevolving the gates of all wonders.\nOpening the eye of the mysterious female,\nordinary and sacred part at once.\n\nSeated on high, radiant with joy.\nLifting the ten directions’ realm,\nsetting down, delighting in heaven’s truth.\nUnchanged through ancient and modern,\nwithin the gourd, sun and moon renewed.\n\nSevering the tangled vines, no more dream’s allure—\nbeyond the white horse crag,\nthe herdboy sleeps soundly.\nMan and steed unshaken,\nthe bright moon faces green mountains.\n\nIn the clear night, where is there no clarity?\nThe three blasts, four calls—\nherdboy and horse leave no trace.\nThe true great Dao is non-action,\noriginally, the family’s inherent Way.\n\nSilent, the one nature encompasses all—\nsilent, the heart does not arise,\nwhen heart arises, bondage is born.\nWhere the two things are both forgotten,\nnothing is not embraced.\n\nHidden in secrecy, the form concealed beyond the humble hut.\nThe numinous terrace’s hidden Dharma,\neight leaves shared with seven flowers.\nWithin the shadowless thatched hut,\nsitting alone, refining cinnabar.\n\nThe horse dead, the solitary body strolls at ease—\nthe horse dead, nature knows no sorrow,\nthe solitary body roams ten thousand miles.\nA single spirit unobstructed,\nthis is the one neither lingering nor staying.\n\nFreely singing and dancing, feigning folly—\ncarefree, without a single worry,\nfreely attaining liberation.\nSinging and dancing, riding the wind away,\nthe bright moon shines on the southern tower.\n\nSwift steps resemble the nature of the idle—\nthe true nature of ignorance,\nthe empty nature is the Dharma-body.\nAfter awakening, not one thing remains,\nwithout nature, things are naturally real.\n\nConstantly guard the One, speak not of three.\nConstantly guard the not-empty emptiness,\nno-thing is the family’s inherent Way.\nWhere the body is wholly forgotten,\nhidden within the great void.\n\nThe unending radiance knows no obstruction—\nhanging up the Xuanyuan mirror,\ncold light pierces the azure sky.\nBeneath the clear wind crag, it rises,\na single wisp of colored cloud’s trace.\n\nThe furnace cools, the scrolls set aside, pure discourse ends.\nMy heart like the autumn moon,\nthe jade-green pool’s light, bright and clear.\nNothing compares to this,\nhow can I speak of it?\n\nThe horse and man both forgotten, utterly silent—\nthis double forgetting is hardest to speak,\nits wondrous function, continuous and unbroken.\nThe root of learning’s cessation is non-action,\nnon-action is the root of spontaneity.\n\nInwardly guarding, nurturing the true and natural.\nInwardly guarding the golden true precepts,\nacting beyond the four births.\nOriginally, not one thing exists,\nvast and free, the great spontaneity.\n\nThe great Dao needs no skillful means—\nthe great Dao is without sentiment,\ngood and evil arise within skill.\nLifting all, striking all away,\nthe mysterious gate’s great Dao flourishes.\n\nHungry, eat; thirsty, drink; tired, sleep.\nWhen hungry, one must eat,\nwhen tired, sleep at ease.\nOriginally without restraint,\nwhere is there not spontaneity?\n\nAttaining the One, forgetting the heart, single-mindedly guarding the One—\nattaining the One, forgetting the heart’s guard,\nthe heartless nature endures long.\nSilently revolving the celestial circuit,\nfacing south, gazing at the Northern Dipper.\n\nThe gates of all wonders, mysterious and again mysterious—\nthe wondrous gate always closed, nothing is,\nlifting it, eighty thousand miles open.\nSevering the tangled vines, no more dream’s allure,\nfully knowing the mystery upon mystery, the supreme clarity.\n\nRefining the jade embryo, distinguishing creation—\nrefining the jade embryo’s guest,\nhow many are within?\nPenetrating heaven and earth’s revolutions,\nround and round, a single true flavor.\n\nWithin the gourd, another heaven exists—\nlooking up, heaven is not seen,\nlooking down, earth is not seen.\nThe wondrous emptiness, hard to speak,\nthe Dao’s transformation knows no bounds.\n\nThe Dharma-body, pure and clear, penetrates the three heavens—\nI come from purity,\nlater, I depart from purity.\nClear beyond the nine heavens,\na single spirit finds no attachment.\n\nNames and distinctions all forgotten, speak not at all—\nwho plucks the stringless lute,\nwith wondrous hands, striking pure tones?\nSuddenly, the spring thunder resounds,\nits echoes heard in the nine skies.\n\nThe formless pagoda is ever present—\nin the East, lingzhi grass grows,\nin the West, golden flowers bloom.\nThe true fool of non-action,\nworthy to be the seven-tiered pagoda.\n\nThe golden dragon, the emperor rides, eternally prolonging years—\na single strike shatters the mysterious gate,\nthoroughly investigating the mechanisms of all truths.\nXuanyuan ascends the golden palace,\nthe giant spirit rides the crane in flight.\n\nNature extinguished, heart forgotten, nothing remains—\nnature and heart extinguished,\nvast and empty, forming chaos.\nThe non-acting lion’s child,\nhow could it not keep to its place?\n\nBare and radiant, the luminous ford—\nbare and radiant, the luminous ford,\nred and unadorned, the phoenix’s marrow.\nRound and complete, the mirror beyond form,\nbright and shining, the purple-refined immortal.\n\nAt the beginning, who knows whose child it was—\nfrom nothingness, nothingness gives birth to qi,\nqi renews the primordial beginning.\nWho knows whose child it was?\nReturning to the root, nature’s heaven is true.\n\nOriginally, the first purple-gold immortal—\nthe primordial Jade Clarity Heaven,\nall names embody spontaneity.\nBright and shining, this clear mirror,\nthe great net’s purple-refined immortal.\n\n*Upper Scroll of the
