  "full_translation": "**The Record of Master Zhāngchūn’s Western Journey (Yuan) by Lǐ Zhìcháng**\n\nMaster Zhāngchūn, surnamed Qiū, given name Chǔjī, courtesy name Tōngmì, a native of Jìngzhou’s Qīxiá, had not yet received his cap when he left home and became a disciple of Master Zhòngyáng. He dwelled at Pánxī and Lóngmén for thirteen years, where his true energy and perseverance matured, and his understanding of the Dao/Way was fulfilled. In his later years, he returned to the seaside.\n\nBefore the year *Wùyín*, Master was in Jìngzhou, and the officials of Hénán repeatedly sought to dispatch envoys to summon him, but matters were delayed and thus not carried out. The following year, he resided at Lái State’s Hào Tiān Guān.\n\nIn the fourth month of summer, envoys from Hénán’s borderlands came to invite him to accompany them. Master declined, and the envoys returned with his inscribed poems and verses of praise.\n\nLater, another envoy arrived from Dà Liáng, only to depart upon learning that Shāndōng was still held by the Sòng forces.\n\nThat same year, in the eighth month, the Grand Marshal of Jiāngnán, Lǐ Gōng Quán and Péng Gōng Yìbīn, came to request his presence, but Master did not go. Afterward, invitations came from various places, and the officials of Lái State found the task difficult. Master then declared:\n\n*\"My comings and goings are determined by Heaven. It is not something that mortals like you can comprehend. There will be times when I cannot be detained—then I shall depart.\"*\n\nSoon after, Chéngjìsī, the Emperor, sent his attendant Lǐu Zhònglù with a *Jīntóu* (golden) decree, its wording:\n\n*\"If I were to personally go, you may act as you see fit.\"*\n\nThen, twenty Mongol envoys arrived in succession, transmitting imperial edicts urging his attendance. As Master hesitated, Zhònglù said:\n\n*\"Master’s name is renowned across the four seas. The Emperor specially commissioned me, Zhònglù, to cross mountains and oceans without limit of time, and I am determined to bring you back.\"*\n\nMaster replied:\n\n*\"Since the turmoil of war, boundaries shift between realms. You have braved dangers to reach me—your efforts are indeed great.\"*\n\nZhònglù said:\n\n*\"I have received the sovereign’s command and dare not withhold my utmost strength.\"*\n\nIn the fifth month of that year, Zhònglù received the decree in *Nuòmǎn Guó* (Naiman Country) at *Wùlǐduō*.\nIn the sixth month, he arrived at *Báidēng* (White Mountain) in *Wēiníng* (威宁), where he received word from the winged envoy *Chángzhēn*.\nIn the seventh month, he reached *Déxīng* (德兴), but the *Yùyōng* (居庸) road was obstructed, so the officials of *Yānjīng* (燕京) dispatched soldiers to escort him.\nIn the eighth month, he reached the capital, where the Daoist community murmured:\n\n*\"Whether Master will stay or go is uncertain.\"*\n\nPassing through *Zhōngshān* (中山) and *Zhēndìng* (真定), rumors spread that Master was in *Dōnglái* (东莱). They then encountered the *Ānfù Sī* (安抚司) officials of *Yìdōu Fù* (益都府), Wú Yàn and Jiǎng Yuán, who finally provided accurate details. They planned to send five thousand soldiers to welcome Master.\n\nYàn and the others said:\n\n*\"The people of Jīngdōng, hearing that the two courts are discussing peace, have grown somewhat tranquil. If we suddenly advance with troops, they will surely fortify their strongholds and resist us—Master may even flee by boat to the seaside. If you truly wish to succeed, it need not be this way.\"*\n\n「Following his lead, they then conscripted volunteers and gathered twenty riders to proceed.\n\nAs they neared Yìdōu, they dispatched Wú Yàn and Jiǎng Yuán to hasten a report to their commander, Zhāng Lín. Lín sent ten thousand armored soldiers to greet them. Zhòng Lǚ laughed and said:\n\n*\"Why must we pass through here? It is only to seek an audience with the Immortal Master of Spring’s Eternal Bloom. Why do you send armored soldiers?\"*\n\nLín then dismissed his troops, and together they entered, instructing their men to hold their reins. Along the way, they shared these words with all, and no one harbored treacherous schemes. Lín further provided them with mounted couriers.\n\nAt Wèi Zhōu, they encountered Yǐn Gōng.\n\nIn the twelfth month of winter, they arrived together at Dōnglái and conveyed the Emperor’s decree for their summons. The Master, knowing he could not decline, slowly said to Zhòng Lǚ:\n\n*\"Here, food is scarce. You and the others may first return to Yìdōu. Await my completion of the *Shàngyuán Jiào* (上元醮) ritual, and I shall send fifteen riders to meet you. On the eighteenth day, I will depart.\"*\n\nThus, the Imperial envoys and their retinue headed west toward Yìdōu, selecting nineteen disciples beforehand to await their arrival. When the appointed day came, the riders arrived, and they proceeded together.\n\nFrom Wèi Yáng to Qīng Shè, the Imperial envoys had already left. Zhāng Lín reported:\n\n*\"On the seventh day of the first month, four hundred cavalrymen appeared at Línqí, causing great alarm among the Qīng citizens. The envoys intercepted and halted them, but they have yet to be heard from.\"*\n\nThe Master then passed through Chángshān and Zōu Píng, reaching Jì Yáng in early February. The commoners and officials offered incense and bows to welcome him at the southern gate of the town, while the Daoist disciples led the procession in advance. They were fed at the Yǎngsù Ān (养素庵).\n\nThe gathered crowd declared:\n\n*\"Last month, on the eighteenth day, over ten cranes came from the northwest, soaring and calling among the clouds before flying southeast. The next day, at the hour of Chén and Sì, more cranes arrived from the southwest, followed by hundreds and thousands. Some perched, some hovered, flitting around the roof of the hall before departing. Now we understand: whenever cranes appeared, it marked the day the Master set out.\"*\n\nAll raised their hands to their foreheads in reverence.\n\nAfter several days, in the early part of February, the Imperial envoys sent mounted couriers with word:\n\n*\"We have stationed troops at Jiānglíng and moored boats to await you.\"*\n\nThe Master departed the next day. On the thirteenth day, the Imperial envoys arrived with their army to escort him. The Master asked:\n\n*\"Why have you come so late?\"*\n\nThey replied:\n\n*\"The roads were obstructed. We went to Yànjīng to assemble troops, preparing the east for Xīn’ān and the west for Chángshān. Zhòng Lǚ personally led the army to seize Shēnzhōu and conquer Xià Wǔyìng to clear the path, built bridges over the Hùtú, and gathered boats at Jiānglíng—this is why we were delayed.\"*\n\nThe Master said:\n\n*\"This task could only be accomplished by you.\"*\n\nThe following day, they crossed the Hùtú and headed north. On the twenty-second day, they reached Lúgōu, where officials, commoners, monks, and Daoists came to greet them along the road.\n\nThat day, they entered through the Lìzé Gate, with Daoists arrayed in solemn rites chanting before them. The *Xíngshěng* official Shílù Gōng hosted the Master at the Yùxū Guàn (玉虚观), and from then on, those seeking blessings or inscriptions filled his doorstep.\n\nWherever the Master’s retinue passed, Daoist disciples invoked his name to shield the people from military calamities, often averting the misfortune of conscription. The Master’s influence and teachings reached people in such a manner.\n\nThe *Xuānfù* official Wáng Jùchuān composed a poem on his boat, and the Master responded:\n\n*\"Banners flutter, horses neigh in the north,\nGazing eastward toward Yàn’s crossing of the stone bridge.\nTen thousand miles beyond the desert’s sands,\nThree springs suddenly parted from the distant seas.\n\nKindred friends depart the frontier, returning like geese,\nTattered hats endure frost, yet fur coats mend.\nSince leaving the Western Shù in the days of yore,\nNone like the summons to the Northern Court.\"*\n\nThe Master heard that the Imperial retinue was moving westward, and as the seasons grew late, he grew weary of wind and frost, wishing to wait until their return to pay homage at court. Meanwhile, Zhòng Lǚ intended to bring selected young women along, and the Master hesitated, saying:\n\n*\"The people of Qí offered women and music—Confucius left Rú.\nThough I dwell in the mountains, how could I travel with young women?\"*\n\nZhòng Lǚ then ordered *Hèlā* to hasten and report, while the Master also sent someone with a formal petition.\n\nOne day, someone requested an inscription on Yán Lìběn’s *Tàishàng Guòguān Tú* (太上过关图), which reads:\n\n*\"In the west of Shù Province, when parting from Hán’s Pass,\nThe barbarians bowed in reverence—\nThe Great Dao once more laid its foundations.\"*\n\nHe also showed two *gāthā* (偈) to the assembly. The first reads:\n\n*\"Chaos at dawn, chaos at dusk,\nLightness and wildness from ancient times to now.\nEmpty blossoms, empty stillness in thought—\nA heart that is both present and absent.\"*\n\nThe second reads:\n\n*\"Emotions stir with resolute force,\nThe Dao alone remains unyielding.\nEndure insults to tame the wild horses,\nSerene and unhurried through the years.\nIn early April, the crowd urged him to perform a *Jiào* (醮) ritual on the fifteenth day. The Master declined, saying:\n\n*\"Now, the war has not yet ceased. Many displaced souls have the fortune to glimpse the True Person and receive the blessings of the Dao. But the dead linger in endless night, unrelieved by offerings or salvation—there is no little regret among them.\"*\n\nThe Master agreed.\n\nAt the time, a great drought prevailed. On the fourteenth day, after the ritual began, heavy rain fell. The crowd feared the ceremony might be disrupted, but by midday, when the Master arrived at the altar to perform the rites, the skies cleared.\n\nThe crowd rejoiced and sighed:\n\n*\"Rain and clear skies follow human desire—\nCould one of such virtue and profundity move Heaven and Earth so effortlessly?\"*\n\nThe next day, the Master ascended the Yuǎnbǎo Hall (元宝堂) to deliver teachings.\n\nAt that moment, several cranes flew in from the northwest, and all gazed upward. As the ritual papers were burned, one sheet ascended into the sky and vanished, while five cranes circled and danced above it. The scholars and officials all said:\n\n*\"The Master’s utmost sincerity stirs Heaven and Earth.\"*\n\nThe aged Daoist of Nántáng, Zhāng Tiāndù’s son Zhāng Zhen, composed an ode praising the event; all the officials also wrote poems.\n\nWhen the ritual concluded, the Imperial envoy Liú Gōng accompanied the Master northward. Passing through Jūyōng, they encountered bandits at night to its north, who all knelt and withdrew in respect, saying:\n\n*\"Do not alarm our father-teacher.\"*\n\nIn May, the Master arrived at the Lóngyáng Guàn (龙阳观) in Déxīng to spend the summer, sending a poem to the officials of Yànjīng:\n\n*\"Ascending the Dao—where is it found in the wandering of the Spirit-boat?\nSouth, north, east, west all hold their own joys.\nThe emerald heights, where clouds and peaks meet, display Heaven’s grandeur,\nThe azure waves, where mist and markets rise, mark the rain’s path to the shore.\"*\n\n「The Spirit-boat sails through the Eight Extremes, though the void seems distant,\nThe Dao aligns with the Three Pure Ones—its path is never amiss.\nEven crossing the Weak Waters thirty times ten thousand,\nIn a moment, one ascends to the realm of the Immortals.\n\nAt that time, in the capital, my Daoist descendants—\nSun Zhōu (周楚卿), Yáng Biāo (杨彪仲文), Shī Yì (师谞才卿),\nLǐ Shì (李士谦子进), Liú Zhōngyòng (刘中用之),\nChén Shí (陈时可秀玉), Wú Zhāng (吴章德明),\nZhào Zhōnglì (赵中立正卿), Wáng Ruì (王锐威卿),\nZhào Fǎng (赵昉德辉), and Sūn Xǐ (孙锡天锡)—\nthese virtuous gentlemen were those with whom the Master conversed and exchanged verses\nwhile residing in Yùxū (玉虚).\nWáng Fèng (王觏逢辰) and Wáng Zhí (王直哉清甫) also joined him in his wanderings.\n\nThe observatory stood on the sunlit slopes of the mountain,\nwhere many caves and palaces abounded,\nand where practitioners of the Dao/Way often dwelled.\nThe Master thus led his disciples to explore them.\n\nUpon first entering the gorge, he composed a poem:\n*\"A Daoist’s leisurely journey here is doubly delightful,\nWith peaks and ridges arrayed like spears and shields in battle.\nThough Penglái’s realm remains beyond reach,\nThe grottoes already reveal the homes of the Daoists.\nThe pine towers sway in autumn rain and dew,\nThe stone pavilions gleam in evening clouds and mists.\nReflecting now on my former words about Zhōngnán’s lands,\nI wake from dreams—no end to the Western Mountains’ reach.\"*\n\nThe place was refreshing and elevated,\nits grandeur sloping toward the southeast,\nwhere a single gaze could span over three hundred *lǐ*.\nTo the east of the observatory, several *lǐ* away,\na spring welled up from the plain, its coolness most pleasing.\n\nThe Master traversed these lands often,\nand wrote another poem:\n*\"At midday, I walk with the wind to the observatory,\nGazing far upon the mountains, lost in a sea of clouds.\nWhile households endure scorching summer heat,\nA single breeze of cold spring water clears to the bone.\nIn the north, travelers sometimes trust in omens,\nBut here on the Eastern Mound, they play without contention—\n(Plowmen and shepherds yield their shade beneath the embankment.)\nAfter bathing by the stream and sitting in the forest,\nI loosen my hair, open my robe, and expound on the Dao/Way’s truths.\"*\n\nOn the Mid-Autumn Festival,\nthe observatory held its ritual.\nAt midday, talismans were transmitted and precepts conferred,\nand the elderly and young alike suffered from the intense heat,\nall lamenting their discomfort.\n\nIn a short while, clouds gathered above,\nshaped like a round canopy,\nand lingered for some time without dispersing.\nThe crowd rejoiced, leaping in praise.\n\nAgain, the well water sufficed for hundreds,\nbut now over a thousand drew from it,\nand those in charge sought alternative sources.\nFor three days, they dug elsewhere,\nyet the well’s spring suddenly overflowed,\nits supply inexhaustible—\nthese were all auspicious karmic blessings and Heaven’s aid.\n\nAfter the ritual, he inscribed a poem:\n*\"The Great Sage’s boundless compassion saves all living beings,\nTheir offerings of virtue made through the sacred scriptures.\nThe Three Fields protect the spirit and vital *qi*,\nAll phenomena bow in reverence to the sun, moon, and stars.\nThough my mortal flesh still harbors imperfections,\nI cannot evade the teachings that lead to the formless.\nI follow the North Dipper’s ritual fasts (both the South and North Dippers instruct the rites of abstinence),\nGradually ascending to the Southern Palace’s Fire-Refining Court.\nBy the eighth month, in response to the Imperial Envoy of Xuāndé Prefecture,\nGeneral Móliè (移剌公) who summoned me,\nI thus took up residence in the Cháoyuán Guàn (朝元观).\n\nOn the Mid-Autumn night, there were two congratulatory Daoist hymns.\nThe first:\n*\"The clouds dissolve into their peaks,\nThe vast sky congeals its jade—\nThe precious mirror now shines full.\nThe Great Radiance, its brilliance spanning endless deserts,\nExtends beyond the Western Heaven.\nHere in the mortal world, dreams and spirits are intoxicated,\nFeasting at a grand, adorned banquet.\nThe Daoist’s gate is another vessel of purity,\nSilently awakening the field of enlightenment within.\"*\n\nThe second:\n*\"In the depths of the Celestial Caverns,\nFine companions gather in high assembly,\nTheir unbounded leisure knows no end.\nAscending to the Upper Celestial Realm,\nThey fly to the Broad Cold Palace,\nCasually tossing down gold coins.\nThe Spirit-boat glows resplendently,\nChasing away the demon of sleep—\nThe jade hare dances with grace.\nSitting in forgetfulness, they perceive the original truth,\nLetting the *dharma*-realm revolve as it will.\nAfterward, the autumn air grew clear and serene,\nAnd the quiet night was peaceful.\n\nHe then composed two *jué* (绝句) verses:\n*\"The Milky Way stretches vast and deep through the night,\nSilent and lonely, my cold window holds countless thoughts.\nThe world’s strife and discord never reach this place,\nAnd in tranquil stillness, the Daoist’s heart finds ease.\"*\n\nThe second:\n*\"The night is deep and cool as the moon ascends,\nMountains and rivers, earth and sky, all vanish without trace.\nOnly the Dao/Way and virtue remain, their essence undimmed,\nSpanning the Three Heavens, ten thousand *lǐ* in reach.\nThe Cháoyuán Guàn stands at the prefecture’s dry corner,\nIts merit-holder, General Móliè (移剌公),\ndesiring the Master’s northern journey,\nbuilt halls and palaces anew,\nenshrined the honored image,\nand refreshed all the cloud chambers and grottoes.\nIn the tenth month, as the mural of the Patriarch was being painted,\nthe artist, chilled by the cold,\nwas about to halt his work.\nThe Master forbade it, saying:\n*'Zhōu Lǜ (邹律) could yet turn the spring—\nHow much more so the Sage’s shade, which lends support!'*\nThat month, indeed, the weather turned mild as spring,\nwith no wind or sand,\nso the artist completed his task.\nThere was a poem:\n*'Late spring in the borderlands, though harsh, shares the same cold;\nFlying stones and whirling sands stir great winds.\nMigratory geese, their wings drooping, hurry southward,\nTravelers weary, their northward journey endless.\nWhen I arrived in the tenth month, frost was still thin,\nAnd men marveled that streams flowed through the thousand peaks.\nHad it not been for the gentle warmth of the small spring,\nHeaven would not have fulfilled the mural’s completion.*\n\nSoon after, Ālǐ Xiān (阿里鲜) came from the camp of the Great Khan,\nYùwēn Dàwáng (斡辰大王),\nsent an envoy to request the Master’s presence.\nThen, the Imperial Pacifier, Wáng Jùchān (王公巨川),\nalso arrived, saying:\n*'By the Great Khan’s decree:\nIf the Master travels westward,\nhe may pass through my lands.'*\nThe Master assented.\n\nThat month, as he journeyed northward toward Wàngshān,\nHéliè (曷剌) submitted a memorial requesting his return,\nand there was an edict:\n*'By the decree of the Great Khan, Chéngjísī (成吉思) Emperor,\nto the True Person, Master Qiū (丘师).\nIt further states:\nOnly the Master’s Dao surpasses the Three Sages,\nHis virtue is profound and manifold.\nIts final words:\n*\"The Cloud Pavilion was launched from Penglái,\nThe Crane Chariot may wander in Indra’s realm.\nDàmó (达磨) marched eastward,\nTransmitting the seal of the Original Mind;\nLǎozǐ (老氏) journeyed westward,\nSometimes transforming into the Barbarian to attain the Dao/Way.\nThough the river’s path is wide,\nGazing upon the few steps and staff, it seems no distance at all.\nNow, in response to your letter,\nI make clear my intention.\"*\n\nIn autumn’s heat, the Master was in better health than usual.\nThough his age spared him much exertion,\nhis esteem was so great.\n\nThe Great Khan again decreed to Liú Zhōnglù (刘仲禄):\n*\"Do not let the True Person suffer hunger or toil,\nBut support him gently on his journey home.\"*\n\nThe Master conferred with the Imperial Envoy, saying:\n*\"The cold has already set in,\nAnd the sandy roads stretch far.\nWhat the Daoists require for their journey is not yet prepared—\nWe should return to Lóngyáng,\nAnd depart in the spring.\"*\n\nThe Imperial Envoy complied with his words. On the eighteenth day, he journeyed south to Lóngyáng.\n\nAlong the Daoist path, friends bid farewell, many weeping in tears.\n\nThe Master composed a poem to show the assembly:\n*\"Temporary parting in life is still bearable,\nBut enduring separation after death is unbearable.\nThe world’s disputes unsettle the heart,\nWhile the Wheel of Rebirth and suffering’s bitterness are hard to accept.\"*\n\nThe following day, he arrived at the Lóngyáng observatory to spend the winter.\n\nOn the fourteenth day of the eleventh month, he went to the Lóngyán Temple (龍岩寺) to fast, and inscribed a poem on the western veranda of the hall:\n\n*\"With staff in hand, I seek the mountain recluse,\nYet empty waters stretch deep, pale and colorless.\nLast night, snowflakes filled the rocky peaks,\nToday, the mountain’s light mirrors the sky’s whiteness.\nThe heavens are high, the earth’s wind pure and clear,\nMy spirit wanders the Eight Extremes, rising in boundless luminosity.\nI wish to depict the mountain recluse’s true visage,\nBut the Daoist’s task is beyond mortal naming.\"*\n\nIn the twelfth month, he sent a poem to his Daoist friends in Yànjīng (燕京):\n\n*\"This journey is truly arduous,\nThis farewell must be long spoken.\nNorthward, I cross the Wild Fox Ridge,\nWestward, I reach the Heavenly Horse Land.\nThe Yīn Mountains lack the Sea of Ships,\nWhite grasses mark the battlefield’s sand.\nI lament my lack of sagehood—\nHow could I compare to those who traverse the Great Wilderness?\nHe also wrote:\nIf the capital has poems to mark my departure,\nSend them early to Lóngyáng before I cross the pass.\nIn days of old, some parted with shoes on the bed,\nNow, none dream of bidding farewell with staff in hand.\nAgain, he sent a poem to his Daoist friends in Yànjīng:\nTen years of war and fire, the people’s grief is endless,\nA thousand among ten thousand survive.\nLast year, I was spared by the Emperor’s gracious decree,\nThis spring, I must endure the cold and journey.\nI do not shun the three thousand northern leagues (the Emperor’s former domain),\nYet I still remember the two hundred eastern states.\nIn desperate straits, my breath is but a lingering sigh,\nEarly grant my life and fate relief from sorrow.\"*\n\nOn the eighth day of the second month of the Xīnwèi (辛巳) year, he set out, the weather clear and settled. Daoist friends saw him off in the western suburbs, blocking his horse’s head and weeping:\n\n*\"Our Master departs to the distant ten thousand leagues—\nWhen shall we again have the chance to pay our respects?\"*\n\nThe Master replied:\n*\"If your resolve in the Dao is firm and unyielding,\nYou will meet me again someday.\"*\n\nThe assembly wept once more and pleaded:\n*\"When, then, shall we meet?\"*\n\nThe Master said:\n*\"My journey’s progress is not within mortal control,\nAnd crossing distant lands is fraught with uncertainty—\nWhether my Dao will align or not, I cannot say for certain.\"*\n\nThe assembly said:\n*\"Our Master surely knows—\nWe beg you to inform your disciples.\"*\n\nUnable to refuse, he spoke again:\n*\"Three years to return, three years to return.\"*\n\nOn the tenth day, he rested at the Qí Gāng (翠帡) pass.\n\nThe next day, he crossed the Wild Fox Ridge to the north,\nAscended a height and gazed southward,\nSurveying the Tàiháng (太行) Mountains—\nThe misty peaks were lovely in the clear weather,\nBut to the north, only desolate sand and withered grass remained.\nFrom here, the winds of the Central Plains were forever cut off.\n\nThe Daoist’s heart knows no bounds—\nSong Défāng (宋德芳) and others pointed to the battlefield’s white bones,\nSaying:\n*\"When I return,\nI will offer them the Golden Talisman (金箓),\nFor this too is part of my northern journey’s karmic ties.\"*\n\nPassing through Fǔzhōu (抚州) to the north,\nOn the fifteenth day, he traveled northeast across the Gàilì (盖里) marshes,\nThrough endless salt flats and barren lands,\nBefore spotting the faintest signs of human habitation—\nTwenty or so households.\nTo the south, there were salt pools,\nStretching northeast in a winding line.\nFrom here, there were no rivers,\nAnd water was drawn from dug sand-wells.\nFor thousands of leagues north and south,\nThere were no towering mountains,\nAnd a horse could travel five days before reaching the border of Míngchāng (明昌).\nHe composed a poem to record the journey:\n\n*\"The slopes fold and twist, the road winding in circles,\nSalt fields and stagnant waters mark every turn.\nFor days, I meet no travelers,\nYet after years, horses still return.\nThe earth bears no trees, only wild grasses,\nThe heavens shape low hills, hiding great mountains.\nNo grains grow, but milk and cheese sustain,\nAnd furs or felt tents bring joy to the eye.\"*\n\nHe traveled another six or seven days,\nSuddenly entering the Great Sand Dunes (大沙陀).\nThere, the dunes had stunted willows,\nThe largest wide enough to encircle with one’s arms.\nBeyond a thousand leagues to the northeast,\nWhere the sands ended, no trees grew at all.\n\nOn the first day of the third month,\nHe left the Great Sand Dunes,\nReaching Yú’ér (鱼儿) marshes,\nWhere human settlements clustered together,\nMostly living by tilling fields or fishing.\nIt was already Qīngmíng (清明),\nThe spring hues faint and lingering,\nThe ice still frozen and unmelted.\n\nHe composed a poem:\n*\"The northern lands have always been bitterly cold,\nYet the Great Sand Dunes still hold ice in the third month.\nSeek the Yellow Crane among the recluse scholars,\nRecognize the Kite’s transformation into the Great Eagle.\nSū Wǔ’s northern exile filled him with despair,\nLǐ Líng’s southern gaze found no reliance.\nNow I return to study Lú Yào’s lofty resolve,\nAnd exhaustively observe the highest teachings.\"*\n\nOn the fifth day of the third month,\nHe departed northeastward,\nWhere human settlements stretched far in every direction,\nAll with black carts and white tents,\nFollowing the water and grass for grazing.\nAcross the plains and marshes,\nNot a single tree remained—\nOnly yellow clouds and white grasses as far as the eye could see.\n\nHe did not stray from his path,\nAnd after twenty more days,\nHe finally reached a Sand River (沙河),\nFlowing northwest into the Lùjú (陆局) River.\nThe water barely reached a horse’s belly,\nAnd reeds and thickets of willows grew along its banks.\nCrossing the river and traveling north for three days,\nHe entered the Small Sand Dunes (小沙陀).\n\nOn the first day of the fourth month,\nHe arrived beneath the Great Khan’s tent at Wòchén (斡辰).\nThe ice had just begun to thaw,\nAnd the grass showed the faintest signs of life.\nThere was a wedding celebration,\nAnd within five hundred leagues,\nLeaders sent horses and wagons to assist.\nBlack carts and white tents formed lines numbering thousands.\n\nOn the seventh day,\nHe met the Great Khan,\nWho inquired about prolonging life.\nThe Master said it required fasting and discipline before such teachings could be heard,\nAnd agreed to impart them on the next full moon.\n\nOn that day,\nA great snowstorm arose—\nAnd it ceased.\nThe Great Khan said:\n*\"The Emperor sent an envoy ten thousand leagues,\nSeeking your Daoist wisdom.\nHow dare I presume to ask first?\nMoreover, he instructed Alìxiān (阿里鲜),\n‘When you have seen the Master, return eastward,\nAnd ensure he passes through here.’\"*\n\nOn the seventeenth day,\nThe Great Khan sent a hundred head of cattle and horses,\nAnd ten carts to escort the Master on his way.\nThe Master rode northwest,\nAnd on the twenty-second day,\nHe reached the Lùjú (陆局) River,\nWhere the accumulated waters formed a vast sea,\nStretching hundreds of leagues around.\nThe winds churned waves that cast up great fish,\nWhich the Mongols caught in numbers.\n\nTraveling along the river’s southern bank westward,\nThey sometimes found wild scallions to eat.\n\nOn the first day of the Fifth Month at noon,\nThere was a solar eclipse—\nWhen it ended, the stars reappeared,\nAnd in moments, the light returned.\nAt that time, they were on the southern bank of the river\n(The eclipse began in the southwest, ending in the northeast).\n\nThe land was cool in the mornings and hot in the evenings,\nWith grass abundant in yellow flowers.\nThe river flowed northeast,\nIts banks lined with tall willows,\nWhich the Mongols felled to build their tents.\n\nAfter sixteen days of travel,\nThe river’s course bent around the northwest mountains,\nIts source beyond reach.\nThey camped southwest along the postal road,\nWhere the Mongols rejoiced:\n*\"Last year, we heard our elders speak of your coming.\"*\nThey presented five *dou* of millet,\nAnd the Master repaid them with a *dou* of dates.\nThey delighted, saying,\n*\"We have never seen such things!\"*\nThen they danced in thanks and departed.\n\nAfter another ten days,\nThe summer solstice arrived.\nThey measured shadows—\nThree *chi*, six or seven *cun*—\nAnd looming mountains grew ever sharper.\nFrom there westward, hills and mounds multiplied,\nAnd settlements thickened,\nTheir dwellings all of black carts and white tents.\n\nTheir customs were pastoral and hunting,\nTheir clothing of leather and fur,\nTheir diet of meat and curdled milk.\n\nMen bound their hair, letting it hang to their ears,\nWhile women wore hats of birchbark—\nTwo *chi* high—\nOften wrapped in dark hemp,\nThe wealthy in red silk,\nTheir ends shaped like geese or ducks,\nCalled *gugu*.\nThey strictly forbade others to touch them,\nAnd entering or leaving their tents required bowing.\n\nThey kept no written records,\nRelying on spoken agreements or carved wooden tokens.\nWhen food was shared, all partook;\nIn disputes, they rushed to aid;\nWhen summoned, they did not refuse;\nWhen spoken to, they did not contradict—\nA remnant of ancient virtue.\n\nIn verse, they described their land thus:\n\n*\"Gazing far, mountains and rivers stretch without end,\nMists and winds unbroken, waters flowing long.\nHow did the Creator shape heaven and earth?\nHere, one lets horses and oxen roam free.\nDrinking blood, eating raw meat—\nLike the ancients of old,\nTheir towering caps and bound hair\nDiffer from the Central Plains.\nNo sages could spread their culture here,\nThrough the ages, only freedom reigns.\"*\n\nThe journey continued four more stages. To the northwest, crossing the river, they reached a vast plain, its surrounding mountains and streams all splendid and graceful. To the east and west stood ancient cities, their foundations as if newly laid, their streets and alleys clearly marked, their architecture resembling that of the Central Plains.\n\nNo inscribed records of the years remained to verify their age, though some said they were built by the Khitans. Later, ancient tiles were found buried in the earth, bearing Khitan script—evidently cities established by those Khitan warriors who refused to surrender after the fall of Liao and retreated westward.\n\nIt was also said: \"To the southwest, at the city of Xúnsīgàn, a thousand leagues away, lies the finest region of the Uyghur land, where the Khitans once established their capital, spanning seven generations.\"\n\nOn the thirteenth day of the sixth month, they camped behind the Chángsōng Ridge, where towering pine trees stood dense and lofty, their branches stretching toward the heavens and blotting out the sun. Most grew in mountain shadows and ravines, while those on sunlit slopes were few.\n\nOn the fourteenth day, they passed through a mountain and crossed a shallow river, the air piercingly cold—even the strongest could barely endure.\n\nThat evening, they camped on level ground. On the fifteenth day, at dawn, their tents were encircled by thin ice. Three frosts had fallen, the river’s current sluggish, its chill like the depths of winter.\n\nThe locals remarked: *\"Even in the fifth and sixth months, snow often falls annually. This year, we are fortunate for the clear, warm weather.\"*\n\nThe expedition renamed the ridge **Dàhán Ridge**—for whenever rain came, it brought hail, and the mountain paths twisted like serpents. To the northwest, after another hundred leagues, they again turned northwest before finally reaching flat terrain. There, a **Stone River** ran for over fifty leagues, its banks towering a dozen zhang high, its waters crystal-clear and inviting, its sound like chiming jade.\n\nBetween the sheer cliffs, giant leeks grew three to four feet tall, and upon the ravine’s edge stood pines, each a dozen zhang in height. The western mountains stretched endlessly, their tall pines clustering thickly.\n\nAfter five or six days of mountain travel, the peaks curved and the paths wound, while forests and ridges grew ever more lush. Beneath them, streams poured down. The plains were a mix of pine and birch, as if inhabited by people.\n\nThey then ascended a towering ridge, its grandeur like a vast rainbow, its cliffs rising a thousand ren high. Gazing down, they saw a deep lake—so vast it seemed to swallow men whole.\n\nOn the twenty-eighth day, they anchored east of **Wōlǐduō**, where the **Propagator** (宣抚) submitted a memorial to the **Empress Dowager** (皇后), requesting the expedition’s permission to cross the river by decree. The river flowed northeast, its waters spreading wide and deep, its current impassable—yet they forded it.\n\nEntering the camp, their carriages halted on the southern bank. The encampment stretched for thousands of tents, their supplies of fermented mare’s milk and curdled yogurt. The **Princesses of the Han and Xia** (汉、夏公主) sent winter provisions and food, including millet and white gold (silver) by the measure of ten taels per bushel. Fifty taels could be exchanged for eighty jin of flour—a flour that came from beyond the **Yīnshān Mountains**, carried by **Western merchant camels** (西域贾胡) from two thousand leagues away.\n\nWithin their tents, no flies were found. **Wōlǐduō** (窝里朵) was a **palace on wheels** (行宫) in the Han tongue, its pavilions and banners standing proud—even the ancient **Great Chanyu** (大单于) had never seen such splendor.\n\nOn the ninth day of the seventh month, they traveled southwest with the **Propagator’s envoy** (宣使) for five or six days. Often, they saw snow atop the mountains, and tombs scattered below. Upon reaching the **High Mound** (高陵), they found traces of ancestral worship.\n\nAfter another three days, they passed a mountain—its peak sheer as a blade, its pines and firs dense and thriving. There lay a lake, and beyond it, a great gorge opened to the south, where a river flowed westward. On its sunlit banks, thickets of mixed wood cast dappled shade, while wild chives grew lush as fragrant grass, lining the path for dozens of leagues.\n\nThe northern region boasts the ancient city of **Hé lāxiāo** (曷剌肖). Southwestward, they crossed a sandy battlefield twenty *li* (里) or so, where water and grass were exceedingly sparse. Only then did they first encounter the **Uyghur** (回纥) diverting irrigation channels to flood their wheat fields.\n\nAfter another five or six days, they crossed the ridge and headed south, reaching the **Mongol camp** (蒙古营), where they lodged in a **felt tent** (拂庐).\n\nAt dawn, they followed the winding southern mountains, whose peaks were capped with snow. The master composed a verse to record their journey:\n\n*\"At that time, the **Venerable Master Xuánzàng** (悉达悟空) set out from **Yànzǐchéng** (燕子城, i.e., **Fǔzhōu** 抚州),\nHis heart stirred as he first arrived in this land.\nNorthward, he crossed the Great River for three months’ march (the **Lùjú River** 陆局河, which he reached in full by the fourth month—some two thousand *li* in length),\nAnd westward, he faced endless snow for half a year’s journey (this very place, where the mountains ever bear snow,\nStretching eastward to the Lùjú River, roughly five thousand *li*—and he reached it in full by the seventh month).\nUnable to employ the **Daoist technique of riding the wind and vanishing** (回风隐地), he instead traversed the heavens daily.\nWhen he reached the place where the mountains ended and the waters ceased,\nThe slanted sun still tilted westward as before.\n\nA postal courier informed them: *\"Beyond this northern snow range lies **Tiánzhèn Hǎi** (田镇海), known as **Bā lā hēsūn** (八剌喝孙).*\n*Bā lā hēsūn is a city in the Han tongue. Within it stands a granary, hence its other name, **Cāngtóu** (仓头).*\n\nOn the twenty-fifth day of the seventh month, Han artisans and craftsmen arrived in a steady stream to greet them,\nAll joyously shouting and bowing in welcome, leading the way with **colorful banners** (彩幡),\n**ornate pavilions** (华盖), and **fragrant flowers** (香花).\n\nThere also came the **two consorts of Emperor Zhāngzōng** (章宗二妃)—one, the **Túshàn clan** (徒单氏), the other, the **Jiágǔ clan** (夹谷氏)—\nAs well as the mother of the **Han Princess**, the **Venerable Lady Qīnsè** (钦圣夫人), of the **Yuàn clan** (袁氏),\nWho wept as they came to meet them. Turning to the master, she said:\n*\"Long ago, I heard of your **lofty Daoist virtue and noble reputation** (道德高风),\nYet regretted never having seen you in person. Who would have thought that here, in this place, we would have such a meeting?\"*\n\nThe next day, **Zhèn Hǎi Bā lāhēsūn** (镇海八剌喝孙, i.e., **Tianzhenhai**) came to pay respects.\nThe master spoke to him: *\"My years are many, and by the **imperial decrees** (二诏) of the emperor,\nI could not refuse this distant journey of thousands of *li*.\nNow, at last, I stand before your domain.\"*\n\nThe sands of the desert abound with those who do not till the fields,\nYet rejoice to see this land’s autumn harvest already ripe.\n\nI wish to spend the winter here,\nAwaiting the return of the imperial procession—what say you?\n\nThe **宣使** replied: *\"Since the master has given his decree,\nI dare not oppose or assent. Only Tianzhenhai can decide this.\"*\n\nThe **相公** said: *\"Recently, there was an imperial edict commanding all officials,\nThat if they encounter a **true person** (真人) passing through,\nThey must not delay his journey—clearly, the emperor wishes to see him swiftly.\nIf the master insists on staying here,\nThe fault shall lie with Tianzhenhai. I would rather accompany you in person.\nWhatever the master requires, how could I dare fail to provide?\"*\n\nThe master said: *\"Given these circumstances,\nWe shall depart on the tenth day.\"*\n\nThe **相公** said: *\"Ahead lies a towering mountain and vast marshes,\nNot suitable for carts. It would be best to reduce the carriages and proceed with light cavalry.\"*\n\nFollowing his advice, the master left nine disciples, including **Song Dao’an** (宋道安),\nAnd chose a site to establish an **observatory** (观).\nPeople came without summons—\nThe strong offered their labor, artisans their craft, the wealthy their wealth.\nThe **sacred hall** (圣堂) and its **courtyard** (方丈),\nThe eastern kitchen and western veranda, as well as the **cloud rooms** (云房, *unroofed, built of earth and wood*)\nWere completed in less than a month. A plaque read: **Qixia Observatory** (栖霞观).\nAt the time, the **millet and wheat** (稷黍) were still in the fields,\nBut frost descended in early August, hastening the harvest of barley.\n\nA great wind came from the northwest of the mountain,\nSwirling yellow sands that obscured the sky, rendering all forms indistinct.\nThe master composed a verse to lament his fate:\n\n*\"I am a man of the East, West, South, and North,\nWho has long strayed from the Dao, lost in dust and strife.\nMy white hair sags with age I can no longer bear,\nYet again I tread the yellow sands on distant journeys.\nBefore death, let me gaze upon the world—\nIn my remaining life, I find no joy in heaven’s purity.\nThe four mountains and five peaks I’ve traversed many times,\nThrough the Eight Expanse’s (八表) boundless flight, I’ve entered the realm of the divine.\nThe tenth day, I took my disciple **Xu Jing** (虚静, *Master Xu*) **Zhao Jiugu** (赵九古) and others,\nA dozen or so, with two carriages.\nTwenty-odd Mongol **postal couriers** (驿骑) accompanied us westward along the mountain,\nWhile **宣使** Liu and **相公** Tianzhenhai led a hundred cavalry.\n\n**Li Jiānánu** (李家奴), a follower of Tianzhenhai,\nSaid: *\"Earlier, below this mountain, a spirit cut off my hair from behind.\nI was greatly afraid.\"*\n\nTianzhenhai also said: *\"Even the **Mangguo king** (满国王) was once deceived here by mountain spirits,\nOffered fine food by them.\"*\n\nThe master remained silent, giving no answer.\n\nAfter traveling southwest for three days,\nWe turned eastward, crossing the mountain and the great gorge.\nOn the **Mid-Autumn Festival** (中秋), we reached the northeast of **Jinshan** (金山),\nStopped briefly, then continued southward.\nThe mountain was vast and lofty,\nWith deep valleys and long slopes—\nCarts could not pass.\nThe **Third Prince** (三太子) had once led an army,\nAnd only then was the path cleared.\nNow, the master ordered the hundred cavalry to pull the ropes,\nHauling the carriages upward.\n\nAfter traveling four stages,\nWe crossed five ridges (五岭) and emerged from the mountain’s southern foothills,\nHalting by the river to make camp.\nThe officials pitched their tents in a continuous line,\nAnd, finding water and grass suitable,\nAwaited the arrival of the **postal couriers** (铺牛驿骑) and their horses.\nAfter several days, we resumed our journey.\n\nThree more verses were composed:\n\n*\"The cool breeze of August brings refreshing clarity,\nYet how could I endure the evening’s azure sky?\nI wish to chant my sorrow, but find no talent—\nOnly the golden moon above Jin Mountain gleams in vain.\"*\n\n*\"On Jin Mountain’s southern face, the great river flows,\nIts winding curves offering a feast for the autumn’s pure beauty.\nAs evening falls and the moon ascends,\nI sing alone beneath the radiant night sky.\"*\n\n*\"Though Jin Mountain is grand, it does not stand alone in height,\nIts slopes stretch far, like chains binding the earth.\nAcross its heart, the sky and mountain are severed by trees,\nReaching for the clouds, they block the sun—\nA deafening, wild cry.\"*\n\nAs we crossed the river to the south,\nWe passed a small mountain with **five-colored stones** (五色石).\nBeside it, no grass or trees grew,\nAnd its length from head to tail spanned seventy *li*.\n\nThe road ahead was blocked by two red mountains, another thirty *li* distant.\nWithin the saline earth, there stood a small sandy well, where we halted to draw water for sustenance.\nNearby, patches of green grass thrived—\nYet they were trampled bare by the horses’ hooves.\n\nThe envoy and the Prefect of Zhenghai conferred:\n*\"This is the most treacherous stretch. How shall we proceed, my lord?\"*\nThe Prefect replied:\n*\"I have long known this land.\nTogether, let us consult the master.\"* The Prefect said:\n*\"Ahead lies the White Bones Plain—\nA stretch of black stone, two hundred *li* long,\nWhere the northern border of the Shato begins.\nThere, water and grass may yet be found.\nBeyond that, the Great Shato stretches a hundred *li* east and west—\nIts breadth unknown, perhaps thousands of *li*.\nOnly at the Huixia city shall we find water and grass.\"*\n\nThe master asked: *\"What is the White Bones Plain?\"*\nThe Prefect answered:\n*\"An ancient battlefield. Exhausted soldiers who reached it—\nTen perished for every one who returned.\nA deathly place.\nEven the mighty Manchu forces were once defeated here.\nWhen the sun is high, men and beasts alike perish from exhaustion.\nOnly by traveling at night, half the journey may be endured.\nBy midday tomorrow, we shall find water and grass.\nRest briefly, then depart at dusk.\nWe must cross a sandy ridge a hundred *li* long—\nLike a ship tossed upon monstrous waves.\nBy dawn the next day, we shall reach the city.\"*\n\n*\"Night travel is best, yet fear the gloom—\nDemons and spirits may plague us.\nWe must smear blood upon the horses’ manes to ward them off.\"*\n\nThe master laughed:\n*\"Evil spirits and demons flee righteous men—\nAs the classics attest, who does not know this?\nWhy should a Daoist fear such things?\"*\n\nAt dusk, we set out.\nThe oxen faltered, so we abandoned them,\nDriving instead with six horses—\nNever again to use oxen.\n\nTo the south, beyond the Shato’s northern edge,\nThe horizon glowed like silver mist.\nWe asked our companions, but none knew its name.\nThe master said: *\"That is the Yinshan Range.\"*\n\nThe next day, after passing the Shato,\nWe met woodcutters and asked again—\n*\"Indeed,\"* they confirmed.\n\nThus, along the way, I composed:\n\n*\"Towering like clouds, white as sand,\nHow could one know it was but an illusion?\nGradually, its peaks gleamed like crushed jade,\nIts slopes cast silver rays upon the earth.\nA single stroke, a thousand *li* long,\nIlluminating cities and ten thousand homes.\nFrom ancient times to now, it shall not fade—\nI sing its praise and point due south.\"*\n\nOn the twenty-seventh day of the eighth month,\nWe reached the Yinshan’s rear,\nWhere the Huixia welcomed us at the outskirts.\nAt the northern gate of the small city,\nThe chieftain offered grape wine, exotic fruits,\nLarge flatbreads, and wild onions.\nHe tore a strip of Persian cloth a *chi* wide\nAnd said:\n*\"This is the Andzhou, three hundred *li* before the Yinshan.\nThe land is scorching, and grapes grow in abundance.\"*\n\nThe next day, we traveled west along the river,\nPassing through two small cities, each with inhabitants.\nThe grain and barley were newly harvested,\nDependent on spring water for irrigation—\nA rare autumn, for the rains had been scarce.\n\nTo the west lay the great city of Bieshi Ma,\nWhere officials, commoners, monks, Daoists, and priests—\nHundreds in number—met us with solemn ceremony.\nThe monks wore saffron robes,\nWhile the Daoist priests’ attire differed strangely from China’s.\n\nWe lodged in the upper pavilion of a grape garden\nWest of the city.\nThe Huixia king’s clan urged us to drink grape wine,\nOffering rare flowers, exotic fruits, and fine incense,\nAlong with dwarves performing music and dance—\nAll of them men from the Central Plains.\n\nThe officials and commoners grew ever more respectful,\nAnd as we sat together—monks, Daoists, and scholars—\nWe inquired about their customs.\n\nThey replied:\n*\"This was once the Northern Court of the Great Tang,\nWhen, in the second year of Jinglong,\nYang Gong served as Grand Protector.\nHis virtuous governance won the hearts of all the tribes,\nAnd his blessings endure to this day.\nHere stand the stone carvings of Longxing and Xisi temples,\nTheir merits still vivid.\nThe temple houses a collection of Buddhist scriptures.\nEven now, Tang-era frontier cities remain.\nTo the east, a few hundred *li* away, lies the prefecture of Xiliang.\nTo the west, three hundred *li* beyond, is the county of Luntai.\"*\n\nThe master asked:\n*\"How many more days’ journey to the capital?\"*\nThey answered:\n*\"West-southwest, another ten thousand *li* to the seat of government.\"*\n\nThat night, wind and rain arose. Outside the garden stood a great tree, and the master again emerged to recite a poem for all:\n\n*\"Beneath the Yinshan pass, the mountain night is silent and vast.\nThe endless sky grows dark with clouds,\nThe great tree’s leaves rustle in the cold wind.\nTen thousand *li* of distant road,\nThree winters of gentle climate.\nI cast aside all worldly burdens,\nAnd let myself drift with the broken sail.\"*\n\nOn the second day of the ninth month, we set out westward.\nBy the fourth day, we lodged east of Luntai, where the local chieftains came to greet us.\nGazing south at Yinshan, its three jagged peaks rise stark against the heavens.\n\nThe master then recounted his poem and gave it to the scholar Li Boqiang, who was present.\nThe poem reads:\n\n*\"Three peaks ascend, piercing the cold clouds,\nFour walls stretch out, winding around the ravine.\nThe Snow Range marks the boundary where mortals dare not tread,\nThe Ice Pool gleams with light—common folk cannot bear its sight (they say: gazing upon this Ice Pool makes the spirit and mind grow dim).\nDeep within the rocks, one may avoid the harm of blades and war (its cliffs are steep and secure; in times of chaos, those who hold fast are spared).\nAbundant waters nourish the crops and grains (beneath lie springs that irrigate the fields, ensuring harvest each autumn).\nFamed as the foremost northern stronghold,\nYet no one has ever painted its splendor.\"*\n\nWe passed through two more cities, and on the ninth day of the ninth month,\nwe arrived at the Uyghur city of Changbala.\nIts king, fearing the reputation of the Master and his ties to the Pacification of the Seas,\nled his entire clan and even the Uyghur monks to greet us from afar.\nOnce we entered, we were invited to a feast on the platform,\nwhere his wife urged us to drink grape wine,\nand presented us with watermelons—each weighing as much as a balance scale,\ntheir sweetness and fragrance surpassing anything in the Central Plains.\nVegetables here rival those of the Han lands.\n\nA monk came to sit with us, and the Master instructed his translator to ask:\n*\"Which scriptures does he study?\"*\nThe monk replied:\n*\"I was tonsured and received precepts,\nTaking the Buddha as my teacher.\"*\nIndeed, all lands to the east once belonged to Tang,\nso to the west, there are no monks or Daoists—\nthe Uyghurs only revere the Western Buddha.\n\nThe following day, we traveled roughly ten stages along the northern slope of Yinshan.\nWe crossed the battlefield, where the sand was fine,\nand when wind arose, it surged like a roaring tide—\nnow gathering, now dispersing, with not a blade of grass in sight.\nWagons sank and horses faltered; we barely emerged by day’s end—\nthis was the White Bones Plain, where the great sands had split.\n\nTo the south lay the foothills of Yinshan.\nAfter crossing the dunes, we traveled another five days,\nlodging at the northern base of Yinshan.\nAt dawn, we turned southward,\ndescending a long slope of seventy or eighty *li*,\nand only at dusk did we rest again.\n\nThe weather was bitterly cold, and there was no water.\nAt morning’s rise, we journeyed southwest for about thirty *li*,\nwhen suddenly we encountered a vast pool—\nnearly two hundred *li* in circumference,\nringed by snow-capped peaks whose reflections shimmered within.\nThe Master named it *Tianchi* [Heavenly Pool].\n\nFollowing the pool’s southern edge,\nwe were flanked by towering ridges,\ndense with pine and birch, their shadows stretching deep—\neach tree stood over a hundred feet tall,\nand from summit to base, there were countless thousands!\nThe currents rushed into narrow gorges,\nfoaming and tumultuous, winding for sixty or seventy *li*.\n\nThe two princes accompanied the Master on his western expedition,\nand they first carved paths through the rocks,\nbuilding forty-eight wooden bridges—\nwide enough for two carts to pass side by side.\nWe lodged in the gorge at twilight,\nand only the next day did we emerge,\nentering the great eastern and western rivers,\nwhere water and grass flourished in abundance.\nThe air felt like spring,\nand we began to see mulberry and locust trees.\n\nThe journey proceeded another thirty *li*,\nand on the twenty-seventh day of the ninth month,\nwe reached the city of **Alimata** [阿里马],\nwhere **Sūmǔn** [速满] King and the Mongol **Tàlāhū** [塔剌忽只] led their troops to greet us,\nand we lodged in the **Western Orchard** [西果园].\n\nThe locals call fruit **Alimata** [阿里马],\nfor the land is rich with harvests,\nand thus the city bears its name.\nThere, they produce **cloth**, called **Tùlǔmá** [秃鲁麻],\ncommonly said to be woven from **sheep’s wool** (種羊毛).\nAt that time, we obtained seven bundles of it\nto make warm garments—\nits fibers resemble those of China.\n\nThe **willow catkins** [柳花] were fresh, delicate, and soft,\nfit for spinning into **thread** [線] and **rope** [繩],\nor weaving into **fabric** [帛] and **cotton** [絮].\nThe farmers also dug **irrigation canals** [渠] to water their fields,\nwhile the locals carried water in **jugs** [瓶],\nbalanced on their heads as they returned.\n\nUpon seeing the **central plain’s water-drawing devices** [中原汲器],\nthey exclaimed with delight:\n*\"The people of **Táohuāshí** [桃花石] excel in all things!\"*\n**Táohuāshí** [桃花石] refers to the **Han people** [漢人].\n\nThe Master composed a verse of his travels from **Jīnshān** [金山] here:\n*\"On the eastern bank of Jīnshān, in the western Yīnshān,*\n*ten thousand cliffs and ravines block the deep stream.*\n*Chaotic rocks lie across the path—*\n*no wheel or hoof has passed here since ancient times.*\n*Last year, the princes led armies in campaign,*\n*clearing roads and building bridges over the rushing waters (the Third Prince built Jīnshān, the Second Prince built Yīnshān).*\n*This year, my Dao/Way seeks to journey westward,*\n*and carriages and horses clamor once more through this pass.*\n\n*Silver peaks and iron cliffs rise in countless layers,*\n*their peaks sharp and their strength unmatched.*\n*At dawn, the sea appears near below,*\n*and under the moon, the Milky Way flows above.*\n*Towering pines stand straight as writing brushes,*\n*dense and swaying, over a hundred feet tall.*\n*Thousands of trees cluster in deep green shade,*\n*yet no bird sings—only silence, vast and hollow.*\n\n*The **Mèngmén** [孟門] Pass crushes **Tàiháng** [太行] Mountain,*\n*but this path is far more narrow than those.*\n*Two carts struggle to ascend and descend,*\n*a hundred horsemen ride in fear, front and back.*\n*The **Heavenly Pool** [天池] and **Sea** [海] lie atop the mountain,*\n*a hundred *li* wide—*\n*the mirror-like surface holds all ten thousand forms.*\n\n*From the county carts to the tethered horses, we descend westward,*\n*and the forty-eight bridges stretch low beneath the ten thousand fathoms.*\n*South of the river, north of the sea, the mountains are endless,*\n*their shapes shifting in myriad ways—yet all the same.*\n*Not like this mountain, so wondrous and sublime,*\n*its rugged grandeur rivaling the work of gods.*\n\n*When I arrived, it was the eighth or ninth month,*\n*and half the mountain was already snow.*\n*Before the mountain, grass and trees were warm as spring,*\n*behind it, my robes and blankets cold as iron.*\n\n*The provisions over successive days surpassed those before.\nThen, four days further west,*\n*we reached the **Dálāshǔmò** [答剌速没辇] River (没辇, a river),*\n*its currents deep and broad.*\n*We followed the western flow,*\n*and the eastern current,*\n*cutting through Yīnshān Mountain,*\n*while its southern bank was still a snowy range.*\n\n*On the second day of the tenth month,*\n*we took a boat to cross,*\n*and southward reached a great mountain,*\n*north of which stood a small city.*\n\n*Again, we journeyed west,*\n*and on the fifth day,*\n*the **imperial emissary** [宣使] announced that the Master had come in response to the decree,*\n*and the distance to the **imperial encampment** [行在] grew near.*\n*The emissary first rode ahead to report,*\n*while only **Zhèn Hǎi** [镇海] Lord accompanied the Master westward.*\n\n*On the seventh day,*\n*we crossed a mountain in the southwest,*\n*and encountered an **Eastern Xia envoy** [東夏使] returning.*\n*He paid respects to the Master before the tent,*\n*and asked: \"From when did you come?\"*\n\n*The envoy replied:*\n*\"We departed the court on the twelfth day of the seventh month,*\n*and the Emperor led forces in pursuit of **Aidar Khan** [算端汗],*\n*driving him to **India** [印度].\"*\n\n*The next day,*\n*we met heavy snow,*\n*and arrived at a **small city of the Uighurs** [回纥小城],*\n*where snow filled a foot’s depth—*\n*by dawn, it had already melted.*\n\n*On the sixteenth day,*\n*we passed **Bǎnqiáo** [板桥] to the southwest,*\n*crossed the river,*\n*and by evening reached the southern mountain’s base—*\n*the domain of **Dàshí Lín Yá** [大石林牙] (Dàshí, the nickname of the scholar **Lín Yá** [林牙]),*\n*whose king was a descendant of the **Liao dynasty** [遼後].*\n*Since the **Jīn dynasty** [金] forces defeated the **Liao** [遼],*\n*Dàshí Lín Yá led thousands to flee westward,*\n*and after ten years of wandering,*\n*they settled here.*\n\n*Its climate and **qi** [氣] differ from those north of Jīnshān,*\n*with vast plains where farming and sericulture flourish.*\n*They ferment **grapes** [蒲萄] into wine,*\n*and the fruits resemble those of China.*\n*Yet, with no rain in summer or autumn,*\n*they rely solely on **diverted rivers** [疏河] for irrigation,*\n*and all grains grow abundantly.*\n\n*To the northeast and southwest,*\n*mountains and rivers stretch for ten thousand *li*,*\n*and this land has been ruled for nearly a hundred years.*\n*Now, the **Mongols** [滿] lost their kingdom,*\n*and took refuge with Dàshí,*\n*reviving their soldiers and horses.*\n*The land is once more seized by bandits.\"*\n\nWhile the **Khans** [算端] of the West [西] reduced their lands,\nthe **Celestial Soldiers** [天兵] arrived,\nand the **Mongols** [滿] were utterly annihilated,\nthe **Khans** [算端] also perished.\n\nMoreover, it was heard that the way ahead was fraught with obstacles.\nA single carriage was destroyed by accident,\nand they halted there.\n\nAfter eighteen days,\nthey traveled westward along the mountains.\n\nOn the seventh or eighth day,\nthe mountains suddenly turned south,\nand a **stone fortress** [石城] blocked their path,\nits stones entirely red,\nwith traces of an ancient garrison.\n\nTo the west stood a great mound,\nlike the **Pleiades** [斗星] aligned in a row.\nThey crossed a **stone bridge** [石桥],\nand after five stages of marching southwest,\nthey reached **Sailan City** [塞蓝城],\nwhere a small **stupa** [塔] stood.\nThe **Uyghur** [回纥] king came to greet them\nand escort them into the guest hall.\n\nIn the early part of the eleventh month,\nheavy rains fell for several days in succession.\nIn the fourth month,\nthe locals took this as a sign of prosperity,\nand they congratulated each other at noon.\n\nOn that day,\n**Master Xuánjìng** [虚静先生] **Zhào Jiǔgǔ** [赵九古]\nspoke to **Emin** [尹公]:\n*\"When I followed my teacher in the **Xuāndé** [宣德] era,*\n*I sensed a destiny for long journeys,*\n*and grew weary of travel and toil.*\n\n*My teacher instructed me:*\n*'The Daoist does not let life or death move the heart,*\n*nor does pleasure or pain concern the mind—*\n*wherever one goes, there is no place unsuitable.'*\n\n*Now that the time of my return approaches,*\n*you must attend well to your father-teacher.*\n\n*After several days,*\n*I feigned illness and departed,*\n*which was on the fifth day of the eleventh month.*\n\n*The teacher ordered his disciples to bury Jiǔgǔ*\n*in the eastern wilds beyond the city walls,*\n*and then continued on.*\n\n*After three more days to the southwest,*\n*they reached another city,*\n*whose ruler was also an **Uyghur** [回纥],*\n*now aged and infirm.*\n*He prepared elaborate farewell gifts,*\n*offering them **steamed flatbread** [汤饼].*\n\n*The next morning,*\n*they passed through yet another city.\"*\n\nAfter another two days of travel, they came upon a river—this was the Hǒchuāng River, where the Uyghur carts sank.\n\nThey crossed via a floating bridge and camped on the western bank.\nThe river official presented a fish to the Uyghur official, its mouth vast and scales absent.\n\nIts source lay between two great snow mountains to the southeast,\ntheir waters turbid yet swift, plunging tens of feet deep—\na torrent rushing northwestward,\nits length unknown, perhaps thousands of miles.\n\nTo the southwest of the river,\nfor over two hundred miles there was no water or grass.\nThey marched through the night,\nthen turned southward,\nglimpsing the great snow mountains as they veered west.\nThe mountains’ shape mirrored those at the southern edge of **Yímǐsīgàn** [邪米思干],\nand he composed this verse:\n\n*The Creator’s grandeur defies all naming,*\n*mountains arrayed east and west by Heaven’s design.*\n*Southward, jade peaks stretch in lofty range,*\n*Northward, golden sands press the wildlands flat.*\n\n*Beneath my couch, the spring’s source flows boundless,*\n*Above, the heavens’ clarity still overflows.*\n*I’ve traveled ten thousand miles, weary of speech,*\n*Yet here my wild song bursts forth beyond control.*\n\nThey reached another city and found water and grass.\n\nThey passed through yet another city,\nwhere Uyghur leaders came far to greet them,\nand feasted in the city’s southern quarter.\nThey offered **grape wine** [蒲萄酒],\nand had children perform acrobatic stunts on poles—\nswordplay and the like.\n\nAfter two more cities,\nhalf a day of mountain travel,\nthey entered a vast plain stretching north and south,\nand rested beneath a great mulberry tree,\nwhose shade could shelter a hundred men.\n\nThey reached another city ahead,\nwhere by the road stood a well,\ndeep beyond a hundred feet.\nAn Uyghur elder drove a cow\nto haul the bucket up by rope,\nquenching the thirst of weary travelers.\n\nAt first, when the Emperor’s western campaign saw this,\nhe marveled and ordered the well’s taxes exempted.\n\nOn the eighteenth day of the twelfth month,\nthey crossed the great river\nand reached the northern outskirts of **Yímǐsīgàn**’s grand city.\nThe **Grand Master** [太师] **Móliè** [移剌] and the **Uyghur** [回纥] and **Mongol** [蒙古] commanders\nled a procession bearing wine to welcome them in the open fields.\nThey erected grand tents,\nand the teacher halted his carriage there.\n\nThe teacher **Liú** [刘] had been delayed by roadblocks,\nand in the gathering, the teacher said to **Bái** [白]:\n*\"I recently learned of a great river a thousand miles away,\nwhere the ferry was destroyed by bandits.\nNow that winter is deep,\nyour father-teacher should come in the spring\nto pay respects at court.\"*\nThe teacher agreed.\n\nSoon after,\nthey entered through the northeastern gate.\n\nThe city was built along the ravines and banks of its ditches.\nIn autumn and summer, when rain was scarce,\nthe people dug two rivers into the city,\nso that water flowed through every lane and alley,\nand every household had access.\n\nWhen the **Shanshan** [算端] clan still held power,\nthe city housed over ten thousand families.\nAfter its fall, only one in four survived—\nmostly **Uyghur** [回纥], who could not claim their own fields\nand had to rely on **Han**, **Khitan** [契丹], and **Hexi** [河西] families.\nIts officials were drawn from all peoples,\nand **Han** artisans lived scattered among the city’s quarters.\n\nThere was a hill rising ten *zhang* high,\nwhere the **Shanshan** had built their new palace—\nthe **Grand Master** [太师] had first occupied it.\nBut since the **Uyghur** struggled with food shortages\nand bandits were rampant,\nhe feared rebellion and moved north of the river.\n\nThe teacher then took up residence in the palace\nand sighed, saying:\n*\"A Daoist lets fate unfold, drifting through the years.\nEven with blades at their throat, they fear no harm.\nHow much more so when bandits have not yet come—\nto worry in advance?\n\nGood and evil follow separate paths;\nthey cannot harm one another.\nLet my followers rest in ease.\"*\n\nThe Grand Master held a vegetarian feast, offering ten *jin* of gold. The teacher declined, and from then on, he was monthly provided with rice, flour, oil, and fruit, saying, *\"This only increases my respect.\"*\n\nThe official, seeing the teacher drank little, requested a hundred *dou* of grapes to make new wine. The teacher said, *\"Why wine at all?\"* He only asked for the quantity, saying, *\"That will suffice for guests.\"*\n\nThe grapes endured the winter without spoiling.\n\nHe also saw peacocks and elephants—both creatures from India, thousands of *li* to the south. In his leisure, the teacher composed a poem:\n\n*\"In February, I set out; by October, I reached the great Uyghur city walls.\nThe pagoda’s height defies sight—thirteen tiers (carved from bricks, hollow yet intricate, with no visible levels, yet passage within).\nThe mountains’ depth surpasses ten thousand folds.\n\nIn autumn, elephants still roam the outskirts,\nwhile summer clouds, rainless, never summon dragons.\n\nFine vegetables, wheat porridge, grape wine—\nI eat my fill, sleep soundly, nurturing my natural indolence.\"*\n\nAfter wintering there, the imperial envoy and the Viceroy of Zhenhai sent officers like Heluo, leading hundreds of soldiers to scout ahead. Han people often came to pay homage.\n\nA scholar of calendrics stood nearby, and the teacher asked about the solar eclipse on the fifth month’s first day. The man replied, *\"Here, it begins at the *chen* hour and lasts until the sixth month.\"* The teacher said, *\"When I was at Lujuhe, I saw it at noon.\"* Later, near the Golden Mountain, he noted it had reached seven *fen* by the time he arrived. *\"These three places saw it differently,\"* he observed.\n\nReferring to Kong Yingda’s *Spring and Autumn Annals Commentary*, he said, *\"The moon’s shadow obscures the sun, and it is called an eclipse.\"* Judging by this, *\"when the shadow first appears, it is an eclipse. But for those nearby, the difference spans thousands of *li*.\"*\n\n*\"It is like shading a lamp with a fan—where the shadow falls, the light vanishes.\nThe farther the fan moves, the more the lamp’s glow returns.\"*\n\nLater, in the old palace, he inscribed *Fengqi Heitui* on the wall:\n\n**First Verse:**\n*\"A single spark of luminous wisdom, hidden yet awakening—\nIn heaven or earth, no trace of presence or absence.\nAlone across the four seas and eight wastes,\nNeither void nor existent—who could witness this?\n\nA glance, a raised brow, and the whole body reveals itself.\nAmid the boundless *dharma-realm*, it departs transcendent.\nThrough countless kalpas of wheeling rebirth, a single encounter—\nThe Nine *Yuan* ascend the Three Pure Ones’ path.\"*\n\n**Second Verse:**\n*\"Sun and moon cycle endlessly, no fixed end—\nSpring fades, autumn comes, how many flourishings and decays?\nFive Emperors, Three Sovereigns, thousandfold ages—\nEach rise and fall follows this eternal law.\n\nDeath gives way to birth, birth to death again—\nThe wheel of transformation, when will it cease?\nOnly when reaching the heartless resting place\nCan one attain pure clarity beyond.\"*\n\nTwo more poems followed:\n\n**First:**\n*\"East Sea to West Qin, decades of profound thought on Dao and its root.\nAt midday, one eclipse—why seek fullness?\nAt third watch, sleepless, I strain my eyes.\nMy true path does not align with celestial ascent,\nYet empty fame spreads across the northern frontier.\nLet great kings issue clear decrees—\nMay the winds and sands carry it to the utmost borders.\"*\n\n**Second:**\n*\"The moon’s shadow moves in measured steps,\nFrom the first hour’s bite to the sixth month’s release.\nAt Lujuhe, it came at noon’s sharp strike,\nBy the Golden Peak, it had consumed seven parts.\nThree places saw it differently—\nShadows stretch where light once burned.\n\nLike a fan blocking a lamp’s glow,\nWhere the shadow falls, the brightness fades.\nThe farther the hand, the more light shows—\nThus the eclipse shifts with the eye’s gaze.\"*\n\n**Second:**\n\n*\"At youth’s first bloom, I served the True beside the boundless ocean waves,\nIn middle years, I fled my traces to the lofty Erlang Mountains.\nFrom the south of the Yellow River, I ascended as a soaring crane,\nTo the northern frontier, I proclaimed the task of hooking the giant tortoise.\n\nThe boundless mountains and rivers stretch endlessly,\nMy striving heart, ever entangled in deeds, wearies in vain.\nThough I grasp the **Three Thousand Worlds**,\nI cannot yet escape the limits of mundane powers.\n\nThat year, in the intercalary twelfth month as it neared its end,\nScouts returned, bearing word from the Imperial Envoy:\n‘The Two Princes have marshaled their armies,\nRepaired the bridges, and crushed the local rebels.’\n\nHaitala and others came to the camp to greet the Prince,\nSaying, ‘The Master wishes to pay homage to the Emperor’s court.’\nThe Prince then gave orders:\n‘The Imperial Procession has halted at the southeast of the Great Snow Mountain,\nYet now the snow has piled its gates a hundred *li* deep—\nImpassable, this is the very path you must take.\nFor my sake, summon the Master here,\nThat he may await the opportune moment.\nWhen he comes, I shall dispatch Mongol troops to escort him into that city.’\n\nThe Master replied to the Envoy:\n‘I hear that south of the River for a thousand *li*,\nThere is no sustenance at all.\nMy food requires rice and wheat, vegetables and greens—\nReturn and inform the Prince’s staff of this.’\n\nIn the spring of the year *Rénwǔ* (壬午), the first month,\nThe *píliàng* (杷榄) bloomed—like small peaches,\nWaiting till autumn to gather its fruit for eating,\n\nThe Envoy then, in due course, presented his report.\nThe Emperor was pleased and detained him for several days before he returned.\n\nThe Master thus left three of his disciples—Yín Zhìpíng and others—at the lodging,\nAnd set out with five or six attendants and the Imperial Envoy on the fifteenth day of the third month.\n\nOn the fourth day, they passed through Jiéshí City,\nWhere advance orders had been given: *\"Let the Mongol and Huíhé (回纥) troops under the command of Wànhù Bōlǔzhī escort the Master with a thousand soldiers.\"*\n\nCrossing the Iron Gate Pass, they traveled southeast over the mountains,\nWhose towering heights and jagged rocks stretched in chaotic array.\n\nThe soldiers pulled the carriage, and it took two days to reach the foothills.\nFollowing the current southward, the troops then entered the northern mountains to rout the rebels.\n\nOn the fifth day, they arrived at the Xiǎo Hé River,\nWhere they crossed by boat amid lush forests on both banks.\n\nOn the seventh day, they ferried across the Great River—\nThis was the place of the *Āmù* (阿母) *niǎn* (辇).\n\nProceeding southeast, they anchored at night on the banks of an ancient canal,\nWhere reeds and cattails carpeted the earth, unlike anything seen in the Central Plains.\n\nThe larger ones retained their green leaves even through winter, unwithering.\nThe Master took them as staffs, and when laid across the wagon axle at night,\nThe axle never bent beneath their weight.\n\nThe smaller ones shed their leaves in autumn and sprouted anew in spring.\n\nFurther south, the mountains held thick-walled bamboo,\nWhich the soldiers fashioned into spears and halberds.\n\nAnd they saw *xīyì* (蜥蜴), each measuring three *chǐ* in length,\nWith bodies of deep green and black.\n\nIt was the twenty-ninth day of the third month,\nAnd the Master composed a verse:\n\n*\"Pursuing the Dao remains unfulfilled,*\n*The demons of the heavens strike fear within me.*\n*Eastward I depart from the seas,*\n*Westward I gaze toward the borders of the sun.*\n*No rooster’s crow nor dog’s bark sounds,*\n*And horses and oxen press on in endless succession.\"*\n\nThe Master traversed myriad mountains and ten thousand rivers—\nUnknown where this place might be.\n\nAfter four days, he reached the imperial encampment.\nThe Emperor sent a great minister, **Hè Lā Bó Dé Lái** (喝剌播得來), to welcome him,\nOn the fifth day of the fourth month.\n\nThe lodgings were arranged, and he entered to pay his respects.\nThe Emperor greeted him, saying: *\"Other lands’ summons he refuses,\nYet here, crossing ten thousand leagues, you come—\nI rejoice greatly in this.\"*\n\nThe Master replied: *\"The humble ones of the wilderness obey the edict by fate.\nIt is the heavens’ will.\"*\n\nThe Emperor delighted, granted him a seat,\nAnd after the meal inquired: *\"Master, having journeyed so far,\nDo you possess any elixir of longevity to aid me?\"*\n\nThe Master said: *\"There is the **Way of Hygiene** (衛生之道),\nBut no elixir of longevity.\"*\n\nThe Emperor praised his honesty,\nAnd set up two pavilions in the eastern part of his own tent for his residence.\n\nThe translator asked: *\"Do people call you **Téngchīlì Mǒnggǔ Kǒng** (腾吃利蒙古孔)?\nOr do you claim that title yourself?\"*\n\nThe Master said: *\"The wilderness does not name itself—\nIt is what others call me.\"*\n\nThe translator pressed again: *\"What was your old name?\"*\nAnd the Master answered: *\"In the wilderness, four men sought the **Way** from the **Revered Master of the Double Yang** (重陽師),\nThree have already ascended—\nOnly the wilderness remains, and people call me **Master** (先生).\"*\n\nThe Emperor asked **Zhèn Hǎi** (鎮海): *\"What title should the Master bear?\"*\n**Zhèn Hǎi** reported: *\"Some honor him as **Master Father** (師父),\nOthers as **Master of the Way** (真人) or **Immortal** (神仙).\"*\n\nThe Emperor said: *\"From now on, you may be called **Immortal**.\"*\n\nAt this time, the heat was intense,\nSo the imperial retinue camped beneath the snowy peaks to escape it.\nThe Emperor scheduled a **Way-inquiry** (問道) for the fourteenth of the fourth month,\nWith **Dà Zhèn Hǎi** (田鎮海), **Liú Zhòng Lù** (劉仲禄), and **Ālǐ Xiān** (阿里鮮) recording it externally,\nAnd three close attendants taking notes within.\n\nNews came of **Huíhuá** (回纥) bandits harassing the passes,\nAnd the Emperor, desiring to lead the campaign himself,\nChanged the auspicious day to the tenth month.\n\nThe Master begged to return to his old lodgings,\nBut the Emperor said: *\"Come again—\nWould that not be too much labor?\"*\n\nThe Master replied: *\"Two weeks will suffice.\"*\n\nThe Emperor said again: *\"There will be no escort.\"*\nThe Master answered: *\"There is **Xuānchāi Yáng Āgǒu** (宣差楊阿狗).\"*\n\nAfter three more days,\n**Āgǒu** (阿狗) was ordered to supervise the **Huíhuá** (回纥) chieftains,\nWith over a thousand cavalry accompanying him on the journey.\nThey returned by another route.\n\nThe Master then ascended the great mountains—\nThere was a **Stone Gate** (石門), its cliffs sharp as if cut from wax,\nA massive rock spanning above like a bridge.\nBelow, the current was swift,\nAnd soldiers urged their donkeys to cross—\nThe donkeys drowned, and corpses littered the banks.\nThis was a **pass**, newly breached by troops.\n\nEmerging from the gorge,\nHe composed two verses.\n\nThe first reads:\n*\"North of the water, the Iron Gate still stands firm,\nBut south of the water, the Stone Gorge is too dreadful to behold.\nThe cliffs rise sheer, their peaks scraping the heavens,\nWhile the ravine’s cold waves surge, earth-shaking in their descent.\nAlong the path, drowned bodies choke the air—men clap their hands to their noses,\nAnd I, with ears long as the **Qiang** (涧), am moved to sorrow.\nTen years of war, ten thousand leagues—when will the soldiers return,\nAnd restore the land to **Great Peace** (太平)?\"*\n\nThe second reads:\n*\"The **Snowy Peaks** (雪岭) gleam white, leaning against the sky,\nWhile dawn’s light shimmers below, bathing the river’s flow.\nGazing upward, men cross the cliffs on ropes,\nLooking down, the pines hang inverted from the perilous crags.\nThe **May Wind** (五月) blows fierce and cold upon my face,\nYet the **Three-Jiao Fever** (三焦热病) has already healed.\nI came to expound the **Way**, but now only turn my head in vain—\nI await the next auspicious hour to descend to the **Lower Realm** (下元).\"*\n\nWhen the Master first arrived to pay homage,\nThe third month had ended,\nGrasses and trees flourished, and sheep and horses grew fat.\nBy the time he received the edict to depart,\nThe fourth month had passed—\nAll the plants withered away.\n\nHe composed another verse:\n*\"The foreign lands are deep and vast, their affairs beyond reckoning,\nYet the **Dao’s** (道) **yin-yang** (陰陽) and seasonal rhythms are utterly unknown here.\nScarcely had I passed the fourth month when the **Yin Demons** (陰魔) vanished—\n*(For in spring and winter, the rains persist, but in the fourth month, the **Pure Yang** (純陽) reigns, and there is no rain.)*\nNow I laugh at the **Drought Demon** (旱魃), fierce across the heavens.\nThe waters nourish the ten thousand streams in **High Summer** (九夏),\nYet the plants are ravaged as if by **Late Winter** (三冬).\n\nI have traveled back and forth three thousand leagues—\n*(Departing in the third month, returning in the fifth.)*\nNo traveler I meet bears the mark of rain.\nI encountered soldiers returning from the **Western Campaign** (征西),\nMany bearing **coral** (珊瑚).\nOne official exchanged two **catty of white gold** (白金二镒) for ten stalks—\nNearly fifty in all, the tallest over a foot high—\nBut they were won in battle, and so could not be fully preserved.\n\nOn the **Evening of the Double Wu** (重午), he set out for cooler lands.\nBy the fifth or sixth day,\nHe reached **Yǎmǐsīgàn Dàshí** (邪米思干, the Great Stone of **Hézhōngfǔ** (河中府)),\nWhere the officials welcomed him into the lodgings.\nThis was the day of the **Double Wu** (重午).\n\n---\n**The Master’s Western Journey Record (二)** (Longchun Zhenren Xiyou Ji, Volume Two)\n**Master Li** (李公) departed eastward,\nAnd sent verses to the **Daoists of the East** (東方道眾), saying:\n\n*\"At that time, from the seaside city I set out,\nWhile the **Way’s** (道) **dryness and martial strife** (海上干戈) still raged unchecked.\nTo awaken the **Dao of Virtue and Way** (道德) beyond the thousand leagues,\nI did not shrink from the dust and winds of the **Nine Barbarians’** (九夷) lands.\n\nFirst, I climbed the **High Ridge of the West-North** (西北高岭),\n*(That is, the **Wild Fox Ridge** (野狐岭).)*\nGradually turning east-south,\nI pointed toward the **Upper Capital** (上京).\n*(Standing on the eastern bank of the **Lù Jú** (陸局) River,\nI gazed east-south toward the **Upper Capital**.)*\n\nThen I descended southwestward—\n*(Southwest four thousand leagues to **Wùlǐduō** (兀里朵),\nThen another two thousand leagues southwest to the **Yin Mountains** (阴山).)*\nBeyond the **Yin Mountains** (阴山), the name of the land is lost.\n*(Southwest of the **Yin Mountains**, there is a range of great mountains,\nAnd a lesser stream, stretching thousands of leagues to the great city of **Yǎmǐsīgàn** (邪米思干),\nWhere the Master’s lodgings were in the old palace.)*\n\nThe Master had returned to his lodgings,\nWhich were built upon the northern cliffs,\nOverlooking a clear stream ten *zhang* deep.\nThe stream came from the **Snowy Mountains** (雪山),\nAnd was bitterly cold.\n\nIn **Mid-Summer** (仲夏), the heat was fierce,\nSo he reclined in the northern veranda, fanning himself.\nAt night, he slept upon the **Peak Platform** (屋颠之台).\n\nWhen the **Extreme Heat** (极暑) of the sixth month came,\nHe bathed in a pool.\n\nThus the Master adapted to life in this distant realm.\nThe soil of **Hézhōngfǔ** (河中府) was fertile for all grains,\nYet lacked **barley** (荞麦) and **large soybeans** (大豆).\nIn the fourth month, the wheat ripened,\nAnd the locals harvested it, piling it haphazardly on the ground.\nWhen needed, they would thresh it—\nThe work was finished by the sixth month.\n\n**Master Li**, the **Tí Kòng** (提控) of the **Tàishīfǔ** (太师府),\nOffered a five-*mǔ* (亩) melon field,\nWhose fruit was supremely sweet and fragrant—\nA taste unknown in the Central Lands,\nWith some as large as a **dou** (斗) measure.\n\nIn the sixth month,\nThe two **Princes** (太子) returned,\nAnd **Liú Zhòng Lù** (劉仲禄) begged for melons to present to them—\nTen could weigh as much as a **burden** (一担).\n\nThe fruits and vegetables were abundant,\nOnly lacking **taro** (芋) and **chestnuts** (栗).\"\n\nThe fruits of the eggplant were as thick as a coarse finger,\nYet their hue was deep purple-black.\n\nBoth men and women wore their hair unbound.\nMen’s headgear varied—some like distant-mountain caps,\nAdorned with motley dyes and embroidered with cloud motifs,\nTied with tassels.\nFrom the chieftains downward, those in office wore such caps,\nWhile commoners wrapped a white *mòsī* (fine cloth) strip,\nSix *chǐ* long, around their heads.\n\nThe wives of nobles bound their foreheads with silk,\nSome black, some purple,\nOr embroidered with floral patterns and woven beast motifs,\nLong enough to reach six or seven *chǐ*.\nTheir hair hung loose, some encased in cotton pouches—\nPlain, multicolored, or made of cloth—\nNever styled into a chignon,\nBut instead covered with cloth or silk,\nLike the garb of a *bīqúní* (Buddhist nun).\nSuch were the adornments of common women.\n\nTheir clothing often consisted of white *mì* (hemp cloth),\nSewn like a pouch with a narrow top and wide bottom,\nAttached with sleeves—\nCalled *chèn yī* (undergarment),\nWorn by both men and women.\n\nTheir carriages, boats, and farming tools\nDiffered markedly from those of the Central Plains.\n\nThe people used bronze and *kūn* (ironstone) for their vessels,\nOccasionally pottery, including some resembling the *dìngcí* (standard ceramics) of the Central Lands.\nTheir drinking vessels were all made of *liúlí* (glass),\nWhile their weapons were forged from *rén* (crucible steel).\n\nTrade used gold coins without holes,\nBoth sides stamped with *Huíhuá* (回纥) script.\n\nTheir people were tall and strong,\nCapable of bearing heavy loads without burdens.\n\nWhen women married, if their husbands grew poor,\nThey could remarry.\nIf a journey exceeded three months,\nThey were also permitted to wed another.\n\nSome bore beards—\nThose called *Dàshímǎ* (大石马) in their land,\nWho knew their national script\nAnd were entrusted with record-keeping.\n\nDuring the late winter,\nThey observed a month-long fast,\nAnd at dusk, their leaders would slaughter a sheep to share,\nFeasting with guests from night until dawn.\nIn other months, they held six fasts.\n\nThey also erected a perilous pavilion,\nFrom which a large wooden beam jutted outward—\nLike a flying eave, over a *zhāng* in length and width—\nWith an empty pavilion above,\nHanging tassels on all four sides.\n\nEach dawn and dusk,\nTheir leader would ascend it to face the west,\nCalling it \"telling the heavens,\"\nNeither worshipping Buddha nor the Dao.\nThey would shout and chant from its height.\n\nHearing this, all able-bodied men and women\nWould rush to kneel below,\nThe entire nation doing so.\nFailure to comply meant execution.\n\nTheir clothing matched that of the commoners,\nBut their headgear was a fine *mòsī* wrap,\nThree *zhàng* two *chǐ* long,\nReinforced with bamboo.\n\nThe Master found their customs strange\nAnd composed a poem to record them:\n\n*\"Huíhuá’s ruins stretch ten thousand *lǐ*,\nHézhōng’s city stands the mightiest of all.\nThe whole city’s bronze like gold,\nThe market’s warrior garb like Daoist robes.\nThey clip and weave gold for tribute,\nAnd stitch white hemp into their clothes.\nThe spirit melon and white chestnut—\nWho in the Red Land could have tasted them?\nIn summer, the snowy peaks grow cold,\nWith mist and clouds so bleak—\nThe Master then composed a *juéjù* (absolute poem):*\n\n*‘East Mountain’s night breathes a vast, wild haze,\nThe evening glow spreads a crimson sea.\nThe moon, rising late, soars from the sea,\nIts golden light piercing the emerald sky.’*\n\nWhile staying in the guesthouse,\nThe Master had few visitors,\nAmusing himself with scriptures and games,\nAnd wrote another *juéjù*:\n\n*‘Beyond the Yín Mountains, ten thousand *lǐ* away,\nWest of Dàshí, I’ve dwelled half a year.\nIn these distant, crude lands, the Dao is hard to speak of—\nIn quiet chambers and secluded cliffs, I’ll just read my books.’*\n\nOn the seventh day of the seventh month,\nHe dispatched Alī Xiān (阿里鲜) to deliver a memorial\nTo the Imperial Palace, requesting an audience.\n\nOn the seventh day of the eighth month,\nHe received the Emperor’s reply.\n\nOn the eighth day,\nHe departed, with the Tàishī (太师) escorting him for tens of *lǐ*.\n\nThe Master then said: *\"To the east of the Huíhé city, there are two thousand households who have recently rebelled. Night after night, their fires illuminate the city, unsettling the people. The Tàishī should return to pacify them.\"*\n\nThe Tàishī replied: *\"If, along the way, there should be any unforeseen dangers, what then?\"*\n\nThe Master said: *\"What concern is that to the Tàishī?\"*\nAnd so he returned.\n\nOn the twelfth day, they passed through Jiéshí City.\nOn the thirteenth day, they received a thousand foot soldiers and three hundred armored cavalry for escort, then entered the great mountains—this was the alternate path outside the Iron Gate.\n\nThey crossed the Red Water Ravine, where towering peaks rose thousands of *lǐ* high.\nTraveling southeast through the valley, a saline spring flowed from the mountain’s roots. When it dried, it became white salt, so they collected two *dòu* to carry along for use. Further southeast, they ascended the Dividing Ridge, where to the west, a deep ravine gleamed like ice—this too was salt. On the mountain’s slopes, red salt lay like stone, which the Master himself had tasted.\n\nIn the east, salt is mined from the earth; here in these lands, it also emerges from the mountains.\nThe Huíhé people eat flatbreads and crave salt. When thirsty, they drink water, and in winter’s cold, the poor even carry bread to sell.\n\nOn the fourteenth day, they reached the southern slopes of the Iron Gate’s western pass, preparing to leave the mountains.\nThe mountain pass was steep and treacherous, with a collapsed cliff on the left, where the ravine’s waters flowed hidden for about one *lǐ*.\nAt mid-autumn, they arrived at the riverbank, its current vast as the Yellow River, flowing northwest. They crossed by boat and camped on its southern shore.\n\nTo the west lay a mountain stronghold named Tuánbālā, its terrain rugged and fortified.\nThe Third Prince’s medical officer, Master Zhèng, encountered them along the way and presented a poem:\n\n*\"Since ancient times, the mid-autumn moon shines brightest,\nIts cool breeze arriving with the season, the night ever clearer.\nThe heavens’ breath hangs like silver in the Milky Way,\nWhile fish and dragons gleam in the water’s crystalline light.\nFrom Wu and Yue, the towers hum with music and revelry,\nFrom Yan and Qin, the troops feast with wine and delicacies.\nI stand before Your Majesty by the river’s edge,\nHoping to lay down arms and restore the Great Peace.\"*\n\nThey traveled thirty *lǐ* southeast along the river before reaching dry land, then continued by night.\nThey passed through Bānlí City, vast and still echoing with distant barking—its people had recently rebelled and fled.\nAt dawn, after breaking their fast, they traveled east for several *lǐ* until they found a north-flowing stream, barely fordable by horse. They rested and camped on the eastern bank.\n\nOn the twenty-second day, Dànhàn Zhèn welcomed them from the east, escorting them to the Imperial encampment. The Emperor sent Zhèn to ask: *\"Do you wish to see me now? Or would you prefer to rest awhile?\"*\n\nThe Master replied: *\"I wish to enter and pay my respects.\"*\nHe added: *\"Those who follow the Dao have never knelt before the Emperor. Upon entering the tent, one stands with hands clasped—no further ceremony.\"*\n\nAfter the audience, they were granted fermented mare’s milk until they took their leave.\nThe Emperor then asked: *\"Are your provisions in the city sufficient?\"*\nThe Master answered: *\"The Mongols and Huíhé have long been supplied by the Tàishī. Recently, food has grown scarce, and the Tàishī alone has managed it.\"*\n\nThe next day, the Emperor sent an attendant to convey: *\"Would it be acceptable for the True Person to come daily for meals?\"*\nThe Master replied: *\"One who cultivates the Dao in the wilderness seeks only quietude.\"*\nThe Emperor granted his request as he pleased.\n\nOn the twenty-seventh day, the Imperial procession turned north. Along the way, they were repeatedly given grapes, melons, and tea cakes.\nOn the first day of the ninth month, they crossed the river bridge and headed north.\n\nThe Master petitioned: *\"The appointed time for our discussion approaches. The Tàishī Ahǎi should be summoned.\"*\n\nOn the month’s full moon, the Emperor set up a pavilion for a solemn fast, dismissing the attendants. Lamplight blazed as the Master, the Tàishī Ahǎi, and Alī Xiān entered the tent.\nHe declared: *\"Commissioner Zhònglù has traveled ten thousand *lǐ* to attend, and Zhèn has journeyed thousands to escort me. They too should be admitted to hear the Dao’s discourse.\"*\n\nBoth men were summoned in, and whatever the Master spoke was translated by the Tàishī into Mongolian, greatly pleasing the Emperor.\n\nOn the ninth day of the tenth month, under a clear night, the Emperor summoned the Master again to discuss the Dao, and he took great delight.\n\nOn the twenty-third day, the Master was again invited into the pavilion, with the same formalities as before.\nThe Emperor listened with warmth, ordering his attendants to record the words, and commanded them to be inscribed in Han characters—his intent clear that they should not be forgotten.\nTo his retinue, he said: *\"The Three Sovereigns have thrice spoken of the art of nurturing life, and their teachings have deeply moved me. See that these words are not leaked beyond these walls.\"*\n\nFrom that point onward, as they traveled east, the Master frequently expounded on Dao and transformation.\nAfter several more days, they reached thirty *lǐ* southwest of the great city of Yémǐsīgàn.\n\nThe Emperor halted his journey on the first day of the tenth month, twenty *lǐ* east of the great city.\n\nOn the sixth day of that month, the Master Ahai entered to pay his respects.\nThe Emperor asked: *\"Why do your attendants not depart?\"*\nThe Master replied: *\"They do not come seeking me.\"*\nThus, the Emperor commanded the Master to report: *\"I have studied the Dao in the mountains for many years now. I always take pleasure in quiet repose, whether sitting or standing. Before the imperial tent, the soldiers and horses are in constant motion, and my spirit is not at ease. From this point onward, some may go ahead, others may follow behind—let them proceed at their own discretion. The mountains have been greatly favored by your grace.\"*\n\nThe Emperor agreed.\n\nAfter the Master had left, the Emperor sent someone to ask him: *\"Do you wish to stay or depart?\"*\nThe Master replied: *\"No need.\"*\n\nAt that time, a light rain began to fall, green grass sprouted anew, and though mid-winter had passed, snow and rain grew more frequent, and the earth’s vital breath (*qì*) was just beginning to stir.\n\nWhen the Master arrived at this city, he distributed any remaining provisions to the starving people, and often set up soup kitchens, saving many lives.\n\nOn the twenty-sixth day, they departed.\n\nOn the twenty-third day of the twelfth month, the cold snow caused many oxen and horses along the road to freeze to death.\n\nThree days later, as they traveled east, they crossed the **Huo Tan** River (*a great river*), reaching the **Xíngzài** encampment. There, they heard that the ferry bridge had been broken in the middle of the night on the twenty-eighth day, scattering its supports.\n\nThe Emperor inquired about the thunderous lightning, and the Master answered: *\"In the mountains, I have heard that your people do not bathe in the river during summer, do not wash their clothes, nor make felt. If wild silkworms are found, their gathering is forbidden—all out of fear of the Heavenly might. This is not the Dao of reverence for Heaven! I have also heard that the greatest crime is filial disobedience, and Heaven warns through such signs. Now, I hear that many in your realm neglect their parents. You, O Emperor, ride upon virtue and power—you may admonish your people.\"*\n\nThe Emperor rejoiced, saying: *\"The Master’s words truly accord with my heart. Command my attendants to record these teachings in **Huixia** script.\"* (*Huixia* being the script of the Uighurs)\n\nThe Master begged to proclaim these lessons to all the people, but the Emperor refused.\n\nThe Emperor then gathered the Crown Prince, the Princes, and the great ministers, saying: *\"The Han people revere the Dao/Way of the Three Sovereigns just as you revere Heaven. I now believe even more—they are indeed Heavenly beings and humans combined.\"*\n\nHe then expounded the Master’s previous discourses and replies to them, adding: *\"Heaven has sent the Three Sovereigns to speak these words to me. Each of you should engrave them upon your hearts.\"* The Master bowed and withdrew. By the next New Year’s Day, the generals, physicians, and diviners (*wǔbǔ* officials) came to congratulate him.\n\nOn the eleventh day, the horses turned eastward, gazing back at **Yémǐsīgàn** some thousand *lǐ* away, and halted at a great orchard.\n\nOn the eighteenth day, the Master’s disciple Li Gong from the **Tàishīfǔ** (*Grand Master’s Office*) departed. The Master said: *\"Will we meet again?\"*\nLi Gong replied: *\"In the third month.\"*\nThe Master said: *\"You do not understand Heaven’s principles. By the second or third month, I shall have definitely returned east.\"*\n\nOn the twenty-first day, after traveling a short distance eastward, they reached a great river, three *lǐ* northeast of **Sàilán**, where the water and grass were abundant, enough to satiate the oxen and horses. They lingered there.\n\nOn the seventh day of the second month, the Master entered to pay his respects, reporting: *\"In the mountains, I have been distant from the Han lands for about three years, and now I return. This is my true wish—to return to the mountains after three years.\"*\n\nThe Emperor said: *\"I have already traveled east. Can we share the road?\"*\nThe Master replied: *\"I can proceed ahead as you wish.\"*\n\nWhen he left earlier, the Han people asked him about his return, and he had answered: *\"Three years.\"* Now, after the Emperor’s inquiries and discourses had concluded, he again firmly declined to stay.\n\nThe Emperor said: *\"Wait but three or five days. The Crown Prince will arrive, and you may address any unresolved matters of the Dao. Once I comprehend them, I will depart.\"*\n\nOn the eighth day, the Emperor hunted in the eastern foothills, shooting a great boar. His horse stumbled, and the boar stood beside him, daring not to advance. The attendants brought another horse, and the hunt was abandoned as they returned to the palace.\n\nThe Master, hearing of this, entered to remonstrate: *\"The Dao of Heaven favors life. Now that Your Majesty’s years are advanced, it is fitting to hunt less often. The horse’s fall was a Heavenly warning. The boar did not dare advance—Heaven protected it.\"*\n\nThe Emperor said: *\"I have already deeply reflected. The Three Sovereigns’ counsel is indeed most correct.\"*\n\nThe Master replied: *\"I am a Mongol, unskilled in riding and archery, yet unable to cease at once. Though so, the words of the Daoist Master resonate deeply within me.\"*\n\nThe Emperor, turning to his attendant **Jixi Lida**, said: *\"Only follow the Daoist Master’s counsel from now on.\"* Thereafter, for two months, he did not hunt.\n\nOn the twenty-fourth day, the Master again declined the court. The Emperor asked: *\"The Daoist Master is departing—what shall I give him?\"*\n*\"I shall ponder this,\"* the Emperor said, *\"and wait a few more days.\"*\n\nKnowing he could not depart hastily, the Master lingered, waiting.\n\nOn the seventh day of the third month, he again declined the court. The Emperor bestowed cattle, horses, and other gifts, but the Master refused them all, saying: *\"A courier’s horse is sufficient.\"*\n\nThe Emperor asked the interpreter **Ali Xian**: *\"How many Daoist disciples are there in the Han lands?\"*\n*\"Many,\"* he replied. *\"When the Daoist Master arrived, the officials of Dexing Prefecture’s Longyang Observatory had already summoned and pressured men for service.\"*\n\nThe Emperor said: *\"All such levies under my jurisdiction shall be exempted. I shall also issue an imperial edict—sealed with my treasure mark—and command **Ali Xian** (a man of Hexi) as the messenger, with **Menggu Dai** and **Heqila Baha** as his deputies, to escort the Master eastward on his return.\"*\n\nOn the tenth day, the Master took leave and departed. From **Dala** onward, all bore grapes, fine fruits, and saw him off for tens of *li*. At parting, many wept.\n\nThree days later, they reached the southeast of **Sailan**’s great city, where a two-headed serpent, two *chi* long, was often seen by locals. The Master said: *\"My disciples have gone to the outskirts to offer libations at the tomb of the **Virtuous and Tranquil Master, Zhao Gong**.\"*\n\nThe disciples wished to carry his bones back, but the Master said: *\"The Four Great Elements lend this form, yet it shall decay. The true essence of the One is unbound—free and unrestrained.\"* The disciples’ resolve then faltered, and the Master proceeded on the twenty-third day.\n\nThe messenger **Agou** caught up to bid farewell at the southern bank of **Chuimeng’s** palanquin.\n\nTen days later, they reached **Alima City**’s western outskirts, crossing the great river. On the fifth day of the fourth month, they arrived at **Alima City**’s eastern garden. The **Second Prince’s** master carpenter pleaded: *\"Your disciple’s residence has three altars and four hundred followers, who attend morning and evening rites without fail. For days now, we have awaited your crossing—may we beg your instruction? It would be most fortunate.\"*\n\nThe Master declined: *\"My southern fate draws near; I cannot alter my path.\"*\n\nPressing further, the Master said: *\"If there is no other matter, I shall grant it.\"* The next day, the horse the Master rode suddenly galloped northeast, and his attendants could not restrain it. Zhang Gong and others wept, saying: *\"We are fated to miss this—Heaven does not permit his stay.\"*\n\nThat evening, they camped before **Yinshan**. The next day, they crossed the **Forty-Eight Bridges**, followed the stream fifty *li* upstream, and reached **Tianchi Sea**. Passing northeast beyond **Yinshan**, they traveled two days before finally joining the **Yuanli Golden Mountain**’s southern road to the **Great River Post**. They then followed the eastern slopes of **Golden Mountain**, traveling north along the mountains.\n\nOn the twenty-eighth day of the fourth month, a great snowstorm fell. The next day, the mountains were entirely white as they continued northeast along the ridges. Three days later, they reached the foothills of **Abuhan Mountain**.\n\nThe disciples—Song Dao’an and eight others—together with the congregations of Changchun and Yuhua, along with the envoys Guo Dequan and others, traveled far to welcome [the master] into Qixia Guan. Many took refuge.\n\nWhen the master alighted from his carriage, rain fell again. The people rejoiced, saying: *\"In past summers, this place rarely saw rain. Even when thunderstorms came, they mostly struck between the southern and northern mountains. Today, the rain has reached our feet—all due to the blessings of our master’s Dao.\"*\n\nThe locals usually dredged the river to irrigate their fields, and by the eighth day, the wheat and barley would ripen. Yet they never matched the yield of Heaven’s rain. When autumn harvests came, field mice—many of them white—became a plague.\n\nThis land is often cold, and crops mature late. In May, the riverbanks had soil a *chi* deep, beneath which lay firm ice another *chi* thick. After the ritual, [the master] ordered someone to retrieve it.\n\nTo the south, towering ridges bore snow year-round, even in scorching summer, and many marvels were seen there.\n\nNear the western sea, beside a windy grave mound, the soil was white and chalky, cracked like powder. In the second or third month, winds would rise from the southern mountains, and the cliffs and caves would roar first—as if scouts heralding the storm. The wind emerged from the mound, first swirling like countless ram’s horns, then coalescing into a single tempest. It hurled sand and stones, tore roofs from houses, uprooted trees, and shook the hundred rivers before subsiding in the southeast.\n\nFurther east-southeast, behind a ravine, there were three or four water mills. But once the land leveled, the water dwindled and vanished, while the mountains yielded coal.\n\nTo the east, there were two springs. In winter, they would suddenly surge like lakes, then vanish underground, only to burst forth again, carrying fish and shrimp that sometimes drowned villagers. By mid-spring, they would recede, leaving the earth sunken.\n\nA thousand *li* to the northwest lay Jianjian Prefecture, where fine iron was mined. The region had many green rats and grew wheat and barley. A thousand or more Han artisans lived there, weaving silk brocades and embroidered fabrics.\n\nFrom the Daoist temple’s western wing, one could see Golden Mountain, where frequent hailstorms and, in the fifth or sixth month, snowdrifts a *zhang* deep would fall.\n\nIn the northern lands, the Shatuo people gathered *roucangrong* (肉苁蓉), which the locals called *suoyan*. Their water was called *wusu*, and their grass *aibusu*.\n\nDeeper into Yinshan, the pines reached heights of ten *zhang*.\n\nThe congregation told the master: *\"This land is remote, untouched by orthodox teachings since antiquity. Only mountain spirits and demons deceived the people. Since you established the observatory, you have repeatedly held grand rituals and morning assemblies, and many have taken vows against killing. Without your Daoist transformation, how could this have come to pass?\"*\n\nPreviously, in the year *Rénwǔ* (壬午), the Daoist community had been persecuted by malevolent forces, and the disciples were uneasy. Song [Dao’an] was napping in the hall when suddenly, from a celestial window, he saw Master Xu Jing, Zhao Gong, appear and say: *\"A letter has arrived.\"*\n\nDao’an asked: *\"From where?\"*\nHe replied: *\"From Heaven.\"*\n\nThe disciples received and opened it, only to see the characters **Tàiqīng** (太清) vanish abruptly.\n\nThe next day, the master announced: *\"A letter has arrived, and the demonic afflictions are gradually abating.\"*\n\nThere was also a physician named Luo Shēng, who, though skilled, was not malicious. One day, he fell from his horse at the observatory’s gate, breaking his tibia, and immediately regretted it, saying: *\"This was my fault.\"* He then confessed to the Daoist congregation.\n\nThe master traveled eastward, and a letter of instruction arrived, which he displayed for the assembly:\n\n*\"For ten thousand *lǐ* I ride on state horses,*\n*Three years away from my old friends.*\n*The weapons have not yet been laid down,*\n*Yet the Dao/Way is now briefly revealed.*\n\n*Discussing *qi* on autumn nights (as I did before in my teachings on meditation),\n*Returning home in late spring.*\n*The crowd longs to go home endlessly,*\n*But I cannot convey their feelings fully.\"*\n\nThe disciples **Ālìxiān** and others reported to the master: *\"The southern route has abundant sand and stone, little water and grass—it wearies travelers and torments horses. We fear delays.\"*\n\nThe master replied: *\"Divide into three groups to proceed; my disciples will face no harm.\"*\n\nOn the **seventh day of the fifth month**, he ordered **Song Dao’an, Xià Zhìchéng, Sòng Défāng, Mèng Zhìwēn, Hé Zhìjiān,** and **Pán Déchōng**—six men—to depart first.\n\nOn the **fourteenth day**, the master led **Yǐn Zhìpíng, Wáng Zhìmíng, Yú Zhìkě, Jū Zhìyuán, Yáng Zhìjìng,** and **Qí Zhìqīng**—six more—following them, with attendants like **Jiāgǔ Mì** (夹谷妃), **Guō Xuānchāi** (郭宣差), and **Lǐ Wànhù** (李万户), among dozens, seeing them off.\n\nAfter twenty *lǐ*, all dismounted and knelt in farewell, weeping. The master urged his horse forward swiftly.\n\nOn the **eighteenth day**, **Zhāng Zhìsù, Sūn Zhìjiān, Zhèng Zhìxiū, Zhāng Zhìyuǎn,** and **Lǐ Zhìcháng**—five more—departed in succession.\n\nThe master traveled east for **sixteen days**, crossing a great mountain where snow lingered, the cold intense. He rode with ease atop **Fúlù** (拂庐).\n\nOn the **seventeenth day**, the master ate nothing, only sipping broth occasionally.\n\nTo the southeast, he passed a vast sandy plain where grass and trees grew, but swarms of mosquitoes and gnats made it unbearable. That night, he camped on the east bank of the river.\n\nAfter several more days, the master sometimes rode in a carriage. **Yǐn Zhìpíng** and the others asked him: *\"What ails you?\"*\n\nThe master replied: *\"My illness cannot be measured by medicine—it is the refining work of sages and worthies. Though it has not been cured, do not concern yourselves.\"*\n\nThe disciples were uneasy and would not let it go.\n\nThat evening, **Yǐn Zhìpíng** dreamed of a divine man who said: *\"The master’s illness—do not worry, it will heal upon reaching Han land.\"*\n\nAgain, after traversing **three hundred *lǐ* of sandy path**, where water and grass were scarce, the horses pressed forward without rest at night.\n\nThey camped and rose early, now near the northern frontier of the **Shàrén** (夏人). As their encampments spread wider and horses became easier to obtain, the later travelers caught up with the master.\n\nOn the **twenty-first day of the sixth month**, they lodged at **Yúyáng Guān** (渔阳关), where the master still had not eaten.\n\nThe next day, after crossing the pass and traveling east for **fifty *lǐ* more**, the **Yuánshuài** (元帅) of **Fēngzhōu** (丰州) and his subordinates came to greet them. **Yú Xuānchāi** (俞宣差) invited them to rest at his home, offering broth and flatbread.\n\nThat day, the master ate heartily, then established a vegetarian meal, and his eating returned to normal.\n\nThe Daoist disciples said to one another: *\"The divine dream of **Qīnghé** (清和) before was no false vision.\"*\n\nBy then, it was late summer. In the **north-facing chamber**, cool breezes filled the room. **Yú Xuānchāi** requested a written work, and the master inscribed:\n\n*\"My body is at ease, free from worldly thoughts,*\n*Birds rest until the rooster’s cry.*\n*One eye cannot sleep,*\n*What binds my heart?*\n\n*The clouds gather, the moon shines in the stream,*\n*The *qi* is bright, the **Gǔshén** (谷神) is pure.*\n*Not sitting at dawn or dusk,*\n*Yet the practice twists and turns to completion.*\n\n*On the first day of the seventh month*, he again set out.\n\nThe third day, he arrived at Xiàshuǐ (下水). The general, Jiāgǔ Gōng (夹谷公), came out of the city walls to greet him, and lodged him in his residence. More than a thousand people came to pay their respects.\n\nThe general said, *\"I now hold you in even greater reverence.\"* He offered three chickens and three geese.\n\nOn the seventh night of the seventh month, the master strolled beyond the city walls, releasing them into the Hǎizǐ (海子) pond. Soon after, they soared and frolicked among the winds and waves, at ease and content.\n\nThe master composed a poem:\n*\"Nurture your life and preserve your heart to offer at the cook’s hearth,*\n*When you meet my kindness, do not become my dish.*\n\n*A slender boat sends you into the whale’s waves,*\n*We shall meet again when autumn’s three months grow long and the sixth month arrives.*\n\n*Two by two, three by three, good brothers in flight,*\n*Yet autumn comes and your wings are not yet formed.*\n\n*Release them to the deep blue sea,*\n*Where vast waves and billows delight the wild spirit.*\n\nThe next day, he departed.\n\nOn the ninth day of that month, he arrived at Yúnzhōng (云中). The imperial courier, **Zǒngguǎn** (总管), **Ābùhé** (阿不合), along with the Daoist disciples, came out of the city walls to greet him, escorting him back to his residence with a palanquin.\n\nFor twenty days, he resided in the tower. The **Zǒngguǎn** and below, along with the Daoist disciples, attended morning and evening audiences. The officials of Yúnzhōng said, *\"We have come to request your teachings,\"* and presented him with poems, including:\n\n*\"Gaining your insight, I return home early,*\n*Riding the spring breeze, I visit your creations.*\n\n*The three Yang (三阳) begin their transformation,*\n*One breath (一气) naturally surges and harmonizes.*\n\n*Station horses escort me step by step,*\n*Clouds and mountains surround me everywhere.*\n\n*A million li to the capital city,*\n*If I return, how will it be?\"*\n\nThe **Zǒngguǎn** Ālǐxiān was then dispatched to the eastern mountains to summon and exhort the people, earnestly requesting to take along his Daoist disciple Yín Zhìpíng.\n\nThe Master said: *\"The heavens do not yet permit it; though you go, what good will it do?\"*\n\nĀlǐxiān bowed twice and said: *\"If the Prince should lead a great army against them, the common folk will surely suffer slaughter. I beg my revered teacher to speak a word of compassion.\"*\n\nAfter a long silence, the Master said: *\"Even if I cannot save them, it is still better than sitting idly by while they perish.\"*\n\nHe then ordered Qīnghé to accompany him, and gave him two copies of the exhortation scroll. He also heard that many Daoist disciples from the regions south of Xuāndé had come to pay respects, fearing that the randomness of the **Suì'ān** (随庵) would burden him in receiving them. He instructed Yín Gōng to organize and discipline them, and wrote in his own hand:\n\n*\"A journey of ten thousand li through the mortal realm,\nThree years parted from my native land.\nTurning back, my body is aged,\nPassing before my eyes, dreams stretch long!\n\nVast the heavens, boundless the sky,\nAffairs swirl, their fate uncertain.\nFrom the south of the Yangzi to the northern passes,\nSince ancient times, ever thus.\n\nThe Daoist disciples say:\nLast winter, we saw the Master of Emptiness and Tranquility, Zhào Gōng, leading a horse into our gate.\nWe all went out to greet him, yet suddenly he vanished.\nAgain, in Déxīng and Āndìng, others have seen him.\n\nThe prefects and officers, along with all the scholars and commoners of the Heshuo states and counties,\nCompeted to send petitions, as if converging like spokes on a wheel.\nI answered only with a few words.\n\nSome say:\nBefore the Imperial House is at peace,\nThe Daoist Way first flourishes.\nWith boundless merit, the path opens wide,\nAll regional leaders and chiefs,\nDevoted in heart, turn toward it.\nAlas, I cannot multiply my form,\nTo fulfill each hope in kind.\n\nOn the first day of the tenth month,\nI performed a grand exorcism at Lóngmén River.\nOn the fifteenth day,\nI performed a grand exorcism at the local **Cháoyuán Guān** (朝元观).\nOn the fifteenth day of the eleventh month,\nSòng Défāng and others, moved by the vow they made on that day when they saw the white bones at Wild Fox Ridge,\nJoined with the **Tàijūn** (太君) Yín Qiānbì to perform a grand exorcism at Déxīng’s **Lóngyáng Guān** (龙阳观),\nTo aid the lonely spirits in crossing.\n\nIn the days before, the weather grew slightly chill,\nBut once the grand exorcism was set,\nFor two nights and three days, it felt like spring.\n\nAfter the exorcism concluded,\nThe **Yuànshuài** (元帅) Jiǎ Chāng arrived from his own encampment,\nAnd conveyed the decree:\n*\"The Way of the Immortals spans spring to summer,\nThe path is not easy.\nAre the provisions and courier horses satisfactory?\nIn Xuāndé and its surrounding regions,\nDo the local officials attend to your lodging and grain?\nHas the exhortation been received by those below?\"*\n\nI often think of the Immortals, and the Immortals never forget me.\nOn the twenty-sixth of the twelfth month, an exorcism was held at the Three Halls of **Yù Zhōu**, and the Master wintered at **Lóngyáng Guān**.\nMorning and evening, I would often go there, strolling leisurely at **Lónggāng**, gazing down upon **Déxīng**, where after the wars, the villages lay desolate.\nI composed poems to express my thoughts:\n*\"In years past, the woods towered heavenward, dense and vast,\nNow the villages sprawl across the land, wide and open.\nCountless common folk face the blade’s white edge,\nHow many grand halls now crumble to ash and gray?\"*\n\nAnd again:\n*\"Heroes lament in thousands of verses,\nYet how many have lived through the ages?\"*\n\nDelving into the subtleties beyond the material world,\nI sought to escape the cycle of rebirth and earthly dust.\n\nIn the year **Jiāshēn**, on the first day of the second month,\nAn exorcism was held at **Qīushāng Guān** on **Jìnshān**.\nThe observatory stands on the southern slope of **Dàyìshān**,\nWhere clear waters and misty pines embrace the moonlit rocks—\nA sacred ground for the Daoists.\nI inscribed its essence in verse:\n*\"Behind **Qiúyáng Guān**, deep jade cliffs rise,\nTen thousand acres of mist and cloud pierce emerald peaks.\nA single path where peach blossoms rush from rushing waters,\nCurving streams flow through the heart of a cavernous paradise.\"*\n\nAnd again:\n*\"A range of mountains, verdant and towering,\nWhere groups of Immortals pass night and day.\nThe hidden halls lie deep, no mortal treads within,\nYet sometimes the rock walls echo with songs of cave-dwelling Immortals.\"*\n\nThe **Yànjīng Xíngshěng** **Jīnzǐ Shílù Gōng**, along with the **Xuānchāi Liányì Liú Gōng** and other officials,\nSent envoys to humbly request that the Master reside at **Dàtiān Cháng Guān**.\nHe agreed, and later, when summoned by courier,\nHe crossed **Yùyōng Pass** to the south,\nWhere Daoist companions from **Yànjīng** welcomed him at **Shényóu Guān** in **Nánkǒu**.\n\nThe following morning,\nParents, elders, and common folk from all directions led the Master into the capital with incense and flowers,\nAnd the roads were choked with those who came to pay their respects.\n\nEarlier, when the Master had journeyed westward,\nHis disciples had asked when he would return.\nThe Master said: *\"Three years, three years—*\n*I shall return in three years.\"*\nNow, as promised, he had kept his word.\n\nOver the next seven days, he entered **Tiān Cháng Guān**, where a thousand people observed the fast.\nOn the next full moon, the assembly requested a visit to **Yùxū Guān**.\nOn the twenty-fifth of that month,\n**Hèlá** arrived from the **Xínggōng**, bearing a decree:\n*\"When the Immortals reach the Han lands,\nThey purify and transform through the Dao.\nEach day, they recite scriptures and bless my longevity—\nThis is most excellent.\nTeach the Immortals to dwell in the places they love within the fields.\nTo **Ālǐxiān**: The Immortals’ lifespan is long,\nAnd they excel in protection.\nThe Immortals must not forget my words.\"*\n\nIn midsummer,\nThe **Xíngshěng Jīnzǐ Shílù Gōng** and **Liányì Liú Gōng** repeatedly submitted petitions,\nRequesting that the Master oversee **Dàtiān Cháng Guān**.\nOn the twenty-second of that month,\nHe accepted their plea, and as he departed northwestward,\nA number of cranes led the way from the sky.\n\nSince the Master’s stay at **Yùxū**,\nHe sometimes accepted invitations to private households for fasting rituals,\nAnd cranes—three or five at a time—would often fly and call above them.\nIn the north, few had followed the Dao before,\nBut now, through the display of sacred transformations,\nEven the wise and virtuous were turning toward it.\n\nThe eight assemblies all knelt and bowed,\nPerforming the rites of the Dao,\nAnd the customs of the age shifted entirely.\n\nThe well water at **Yùxū** had once been bitter and salty,\nBut in the years **Jiāshēn** and **Yǒuyǒu**,\nWhen Western Daoists arrived in great numbers,\nThe water’s taste changed to sweetness—a fortunate omen.\n\nOn the full moon of late summer,\nThe **Xuānchāi Xiànggōng** sent **Zhàbā** with an eight-part decree:\n*\"Since the Immortals departed,\nI have not once forgotten them,\nAnd the Immortals must not forget me.\nWherever I have lands or dwellings that I cherish,\nLet the disciples always recite scriptures and pray for my blessings.\"*\n\nSince the Master’s return,\nDaoist companions from all directions gathered,\nAnd false teachings faded.\nThe people of the capital flocked to him in devotion,\nAs if each household had received clear instruction—\nTheir doors opened wide, and the numbers swelled a hundredfold over before.\n\nEight assemblies were then established at **Tiān Cháng**:\n**Píngděng**, **Chángchūn**, **Língbǎo**, **Chángshēng**, **Míngzhēn**, **Píng’ān**, **Xiāozāi**, and **Wànlián**.\n\nAfter the Master returned to **Tiān Cháng**,\nMore distant Daoists came seeking his teachings and blessings.\nHe once revealed four verses to them:\n\nThe first:\n*\"Worldly passions know no end,\nThe **Dharma-realm** wears away.\nLikes and dislikes ensnare the heart,\nDragging one adrift—what can be done?\"*\n\nThe second:\n*\"There is a treasure before Heaven’s birth,\nNameless, yet not self-born.\nThe human heart lies hidden and suppressed,\nWhile the **Dharma-realm** roams free.\"*\n\nThe third:\n*\"Chasing things, the eyes grow dizzy,\nToiling in life’s four elements leads to exhaustion.\nThe world is all illusion,\nYet the mind remains unaware of emptiness.\"*\n\nThe fourth:\n*\"Yesterday, I held nothing in restraint,\nToday, my affairs are the same.\nBetter to let go entirely,\nAnd pass the day in boundless void.\"*\n\nAfter each fasting ritual,\nHe would wander to the old imperial gardens of **Qiónghuá**,\nAccompanied by six or seven followers.\nThey would recline beneath the pines,\nSometimes composing poems in turn,\nOr, after tea, ordering his attendants to sing a few verses of *Youxiān* songs.\nAs the sun dipped behind the mountains,\nThey would drift into a tranquil forgetfulness.\n\nThus,\nThe **Xíngshěng** and **Xuānchāi Zhàbā Xiànggōng** presented the northern gardens, ponds, and nearby lands—\nSpanning tens of hectares—\nAnd requested that they be made into a Daoist academy.\nThe Master declined at first,\nBut after repeated requests, he accepted.\n\nLater, he issued an edict to prohibit firewood gathering,\nAnd settled the Daoist companions there,\nOverseeing repairs and improvements.\nHe then submitted a formal report, which the Emperor approved.\n\nFrom that time onward,\nOn fine days and festive occasions,\nThe Master never failed to visit them.\n\nOn **Tomb-Sweeping Day**, he composed two poems:\nThe first:\n*\"A ten-acre pond lies quiet in the imperial garden,\nTall pines and cypresses shroud it in mist.\nPavilions and halls—all now dreams of the past,\nWhile peach blossoms and willows belong to the Immortals in spring.\nBeyond the isle, no purer place exists,\nIn the mortal world, only **Guǎnghán Tiān** compares.\nI know the Creator’s design is fixed—\nWhy beg for fields to sow misfortune for officials and commoners?\"*\n\nThe second:\n*\"At **Qīngmíng**, the apricot blossoms bloom,\nTen thousand doors and gates open and close each day.\nBeyond the isle, the spring waters stretch vast and hazy,\nWhile warm winds rustle through the pines.\nTravelers sigh as the setting sun presses near,\nYet the enlightened linger, delaying the fleeting light.\nHow could I obtain the **Great Elixir** to transmute my bones?\nAnd ascend, embodied, to the **Yùluó Terrace**?\"*\n\nThe *jiǎyǒu* year, the Fourth Month—Lord Marshal Wang Jiuchuan of the Right Wing invited the Master to observe a fast at his residence. The Master, a native of the Right Wing, then spoke of the luxuriant bamboo and trees of Xianyang and Zhongnan Mountains, requesting the Master to inspect the courtyard bamboo.\n\nThe Master said: *\"This bamboo is exceptionally fine. After the ravages of war and fire, such specimens are rare indeed. In my time at Pánxī, the dense forests and towering bamboo were a marvel beyond compare—now, I recall them as in a dream. Now old and my return approaching, I would take but a score of these stalks to plant in the northern veranda of Bǎoyuán, merely to shield my gaze.\"*\n\nLord Marshal Wang said: *\"The realm still suffers from strife, its people hanging by a thread. The Sovereign now honors the Way and reveres the Master’s true teachings, relying on your virtue to safeguard all life. Why speak thus of departure?\"*\nHe begged the Master to extend his compassion and prioritize saving the world.\n\nThe Master struck the ground with his staff, smiling as he replied: *\"Heaven’s decree is fixed—what power lies in mortals?\"*\nNone could fathom his meaning.\n\nBy the end of the Fifth Month, the Master ascended the peak of Shòulè Mountain. Gazing about, the gardens sprawled like emerald canopies, and travelers resting beneath them felt no trace of the scorching heat. There, he composed a *wǔyán* poem:\n\n---\n*Earth meets the frontier’s edge,*\n*Its walls press ancient and modern.*\n*Though palaces lie in ruin,*\n*Fine gardens yet remain.*\n*Green trees cluster thick,*\n*Cool winds blow deep.*\n*As if on an Isle of Immortals,*\n*I survey the eight quarters, chanting.*\n---\n\nLater, upon the Master’s return from Qióngdǎo, Lord Chen Xiùyù came to pay his respects. The Master presented him with a *qīyán lǜ* poem:\n\n---\n*Crags rise steep and lone against Heaven,*\n*Cypress shadows darkly clasp the halls.*\n*Amyriads of mist and haze abide,*\n*While rivers of wind and moon flow idle.*\n*Pines soar from deep ravines,*\n*Strange stones jut from the lake’s embrace.*\n*All are the leisurely arts of longevity—*\n*Refining virtue, offering blessings beyond the capital.*\n\n---\n\nOn the auspicious ninth day of the Ninth Month, Lord Marshal Wang, seeing the *Yínghuǒ* star encroach upon the *Wěi* constellation—an omen of misfortune for the Yan lands—planned to request the Master perform an exorcism (*jiào*). He asked how much it would cost.\n\nThe Master replied: *\"Even a single displaced thing stirs my pity—how much more an entire realm? For years, the people have suffered from levies and exhaustion, both public and private. I shall provide the necessities from the Observing Hall’s endowment, but let the court officials fast and purify themselves in preparation. Beyond that, I require nothing.\"*\n\nThus, the exorcism was set for two days and nights. Though aged, the Master personally prayed at the Mysterious Altar. When the rites concluded that evening, Lord Marshal Wang rejoiced, saying: *\"The *Yínghuǒ* star has already retreated several degrees—we need fear no more!\"*\nHow swift was the Master’s virtue in moving others!\n\nThe Master said: *\"What virtue do I possess? Petitions to Heaven have existed since antiquity—only insincerity fails.\"* As the ancients said: *\"Sincerity moves Heaven.\"* Such is the way.\n\nOn the Ninth of the Ninth, Daoist disciples from afar gathered, some bearing chrysanthemums as offerings. The Master composed a *cí* with a lament for delayed joy:\n\n---\n*A spirit-strain of singular nature,*\n*Waiting for autumn winds to chill its roots.*\n*Scattering blooms by the hundred billions,*\n*Golden petals gleam—*\n*Illuminating the void of Heaven and Earth.*\n*On the Ninth, they fill the hall’s corners,*\n*And all within see clearly,*\n*As if gazing on eternal life,*\n*Unwithering—*\n*Fitting companions for idle repose.*\n\n---\n\nSoon after, a disciple of the Way arrived with silk scrolls, seeking the Master’s autograph. He inscribed them with the words of *\"Fèngqī Dēngwú\"*:\n\n---\n*To gain true rest is rest itself—*\n*Winning leisure, free from toil.*\n*How many bright and resolute souls*\n*Have busied themselves in vain!*\n*Heaven’s shifts know no end,*\n*Yesterday’s song, today’s sorrow.*\n*Who knows tomorrow’s affairs?*\n*Why weary the mind over trifles?*\n\n---\n\nOn another day, someone questioned the Master on a matter. He responded with detached indifference, resolving it with Daoist principle, then recited a verse for him:\n\n---\n*Brush, brush, brush—*\n*Brush away all thoughts until none remain.*\n*When the mind holds nothing,*\n*That is the true person.*\n*The true person is already an Immortal, a Buddha.*\n\nThe man, hearing this, bowed in awe and withdrew.\n\nIn the *bǐngxū* year’s First Month, officials from Pánshān invited the Master to perform a *Huángè* exorcism for three days and nights. That day, the sky cleared, hearts lightened, and spring stirred in the cold valleys. On the eve of the rites, he showed the assembly this poem:\n\n---\n*Twisted peaks plunge deep,*\n*Mountains lift the weary soul.*\n*Ridges vie in towering height,*\n*Great ravines stretch vast and grim.*\n*Seems some flying Immortal passes,*\n*Yet no birds nest here.*\n*Three days of yellow-crowned rites,*\n*Ten thousand households in white attend.*\n\n---\n\nIn the Fifth Month, the capital suffered a severe drought, and farmers could not sow. All feared for the harvest. Officials relocated the market and erected an altar for supplication, but for weeks, there was no response. The Provincial Governor sent envoys with a petition, requesting the Master perform a rain-pleading exorcism for three days and two nights.\n\nOn the night the rites were to begin, clouds gathered from all sides, and soon rain fell. From midnight until mealtime, it did not cease. The Provincial Governor’s envoys arrived with incense, thanking the Master: *\"The capital has long endured drought, the countryside parched, crops unplanted, and the people near despair. Thanks to your virtue and communion with the Highest Truth, sweet dew has descended. The common folk say: ‘This is the rain of the Immortals.’\"*\n\nThe Master replied: *\"The Governor’s sincerity has moved the Highest Truth, who in turn has shown mercy to save all life. What part did I play?\"*\nThe envoys departed, then returned with another message: *\"The rain has fallen, yet the drought remains unrelieved! If only a torrential downpour could come—this drought would end. We beg the Master’s compassion.\"*\n\nThe Master said: *\"Fear not. When mortals move Heaven with sincerity, Heaven answers in kind. The great rain will surely come.\"*\n\nBefore the fast concluded, the storm broke with overwhelming force. That year, the harvest came, and eminent scholars and officials sent poems in celebration.\n\nLater, a certain Wu Dàqīng Déming presented four *jùjué* verses. The Master responded in rhyme.\n\nWu Dàqīng Déming’s four *jùjué* verses:\n\n**First:**\nIn Yan’s moon-palace lies this very land,\nWhere the Transcendent Daoist peers stand.\nAt once the crane-carriage returns to Penglai’s isle,\nA million kalpas’ incense rises from the earthen mound.\n\n**Second:**\nI dwell alone in the deep mountain’s embrace,\nWho could know the world’s praise in its place?\nThe Yellow Emperor’s Daoist came to call,\nYet he spoke not of worldly books or talk.\n\n**Third:**\nDo not dismiss the idle as trifling,\nFor idle men, desireless, join the Celestial ranks.\nIf not here the mind’s ground is opened wide,\nWhen shall you climb the Treasure Peak’s heights?\n\n**Fourth:**\nFrom Chaos’ origin, Nature’s Way unfolds,\nThe luminous spirit spans great and small.\nBorn and dying, ever without self,\nStriding past and present, the Daoist’s ease.\n\nOn the painting of *San Xian* (One, Preserver, and Substance):\nThe perfected True Ones know no end to their Way,\nThree Masters of old—where do their traces display?\nDirectly teaching the Celestial Treasury’s heir,\nTheir deeds in mortal realms rival *Chi Song*’s fame.\n\nTo a supplicant of the Dao, in seven-character verse:\nDawn and dusk rush past in fleeting haste,\nDarkness swaps my life—my temples now threadbare.\nThe Creator’s jest with mortals is but a dream,\nWhat then of yesterday’s strife—what purpose now?\n\nSince receiving the provincial officials’ petition,\nThe Master pitied the Heavenly Long’s sacred halls and shrines,\nTheir dwellings crumbling—windows, steps, and walls in ruin.\nHe ordered his disciples: *“Let them repair what is broken,\nPatch the leaks, straighten what leans.\nSevered hands shall be restored anew.”*\nHe also built forty-plus lodgings,\nNo external aid—all from the monastery’s own means.\n\nEach summer, he ordered the halls to forgo lamps,\nOnly in late autumn did he permit their use,\nA precaution against fire.\n\nIn the tenth month, he resided in *Fanghu*,\nEach evening summoning the assembled *Shide* in order,\nEngaging in lofty discourse, sometimes till dawn.\n\nOn the thirteenth day of *zhōngdōng* (mid-winter),\nHe rose at midnight, pacing the courtyard.\nReturning to his seat, he composed a five-character *lü* poem for the assembly:\n\n*The cosmos vast beneath the boundless sky,\nThree watches spent in toil upon the earth.\nShen’s asterism sinks behind the western peak,\nThe North Star turns—its axis high.*\n*The great momentum cannot be restrained,\nThe boundless heavens hold no veil.*\n*Who governs this eternal cycle’s reign?\nA billion kalpas—unyielding, firm.*\n\nIn *dīnghài* (1387), drought persisted from spring to summer.\nThe officials prayed repeatedly, yet received no relief.\nThe Daoist assembly of the capital,\nOn one day, visited the Master for a rain-appeasing ritual.\nLater, they also requested a disaster-dispelling assembly.\n\nThe Master said: *“I have devoted myself to these rites,\nAnd now you propose the same—\nGood intentions meet without prior agreement.\nYou two groups should only redouble your efforts.”*\nHe set the first day of the fifth month for the rain-appeasing ritual,\nAnd the third day for the thanksgiving ritual.\nIf rain fell by the third day, it would count.\nEven if it rained after, it would not be the ritual’s doing.\n\nSome said: *“Heaven’s will is hard to fathom.\nIf the Master speaks thus, and the deadline passes,\nWill he not invite slander from petty men?”*\n\nThe Master replied: *“This is beyond your understanding.”*\nWhen the ritual was held, rain fell that very day.\nThe next day, it rained a foot deep,\nAnd by the third day, the skies cleared entirely.\nThe thanksgiving ritual concluded as he had foretold.\n\nAt the time, the heat was oppressive.\nGeneral Zhang Zīyǔn invited the Master to West Mountain,\nWhere he visited the temple repeatedly.\nThe day after the fast ended, rain-soaked,\nHe toured the East Mountain Hermitage.\nSeated with guests in the forest at dusk,\nAs evening fell, he composed an absolute verse for the assembly:\n\n*West Mountain’s breeze is crisp and clear,\nPost-rain clouds drift light as air.\nA guest sits deep in the woods,\nWithout thought, the Dao takes root.*\n\nReturning to General Zhang’s estate,\nHe stayed in the tower for several days,\nListening to Daoist teachings till dawn.\n\nHe also responded to invitations from Dàgǔ Hermitage,\nThen to Qīngmèng Hermitage the next day.\n\nThat night, a great rain swept in from the north,\nThunder and lightning clashing violently.\nThe Master said: *“This is the Dao’s power.\nThose who attain the Way wield radiant might—\nThunder and lightning cannot compare.\nNight deepened, guests dispersed,\nThe Master reclined in the grass hall.\nSoon, a terrifying wind and rain struck,\nA single thunderclap nearly shattered the windows,\nThen silence fell—all marveled.*\n\nSome asked: *“If thunder were to strike, why cease so swiftly?”*\nA respondent said: *“Could it be the presence of a Sage\nHas caused the Thunderer to temper his wrath?”*\n\nLater, on the twenty-fifth of the fifth month,\nDaoist Wang Zhìmíng arrived from Qinzhou,\nBearing edicts to rename *Beigōng Xiāndǎo* as *Wàn’ān Gōng*,\nAnd *Chángchūn Guàn* as *Chángchūn Gōng*.\nThe decree ordered all householders of virtue\nTo be enrolled under them,\nAnd granted them the *Jīnhǔ Pái* (Golden Tiger Seal),\nThus all Daoist affairs were placed under the Celestial Masters’ jurisdiction.\n\nAfter the *xiǎoshǔ* (minor heat) node,\nHeavy rains fell repeatedly, easing the scorching heat.\nHe composed a seven-character poem for the assembly:\n\n*Stifling summer chokes the land for ten thousand leagues,\nTidal waves crash against the seas and rivers’ rage.*\n*The autumn harvest’s fine grains now swell in sight,\nThe drought-demon’s curse dissolves by the fifth month’s light.*\n*The people rejoice—life’s hope restored anew,\nThe armies march without command’s decree.*\n*Truly, the Dao’s influence knows no bounds,\nDarkly bestowing abundance on the Holy Court.*\n\nSince the *Qióngdǎo* became a Daoist academy,\nWoodcutters and fishermen vanished for years,\nWhile birds and fish thrived in the gardens and pools,\nAnd visitors came and went without cease.\n\nAfter the fast, the Master rode his horse on ordinary days.\nOn the twenty-first of the sixth month,\nHe fell ill and did not venture out,\nInstead descending to the eastern stream of the palace.\n\nOn the twenty-third,\nNews arrived at noon—\nA great thunderclap split the southern bank of *Tàiyè Pool*,\nFlooding into the East Lake, its roar heard for tens of miles.\nTurtles, crocodiles, fish, and crabs all fled,\nThe pool dried up entirely,\nAnd the *Běikǒu Mountain* collapsed.\n\nThe Master heard this, at first saying nothing. After a long while, he laughed and said: *\"When the mountain collapses and the pool dries, shall I go with it?\"*\n\nOn the fourth of the seventh month, the Master told his disciples: *\"In the past, Dānyáng once gave me a prophecy, saying: After my death, the Daoist teaching shall flourish greatly, and the four quarters shall often be transformed into Daoist lands. You, Gongzhèng, are now in that time. The Daoist academies have all been granted imperial names and quotas. You shall also reside in the grand temples and observatories, with envoys bearing seals and official dispatches to oversee the teaching. This is the moment when your merit is complete, your name established, and you may retire in peace. Every word of Dānyáng’s prophecy has come true, as if sealed by fate itself. Moreover, within the teaching, all matters of administration—both internal and external—are now fully settled. I depart without any regrets.\"*\n\nWhen the Master revealed his illness in Bǎoyuán, on that day, his breath came in shallow gasps. His disciples tried to stop him, but he said: *\"I do not wish to trouble others. You still have your duties to attend to. What difference does it make if I rest in the coffin?\"*\n\nOn the seventh of the seventh month, his disciples again pleaded: *\"Each day, the assembly of devotees is vast. We beg you to extend your great compassion and return to the hall, that we may pay our respects.\"*\n\nThe Master replied: *\"I shall ascend the hall on the ninth day.\"*\n\nThat day, in the afternoon, he composed this farewell verse:\n\n*\"Life and death, dawn and dusk—all one affair,*\n*Like bubbles rising and vanishing in endless water.*\n*Where faint light shines, the hare and crow leap,*\n*When measure is set, mountains and seas are contained.*\n*With a wave, the eight extremes shrink to inches,*\n*With a breath, ten thousand things move like mechanisms.*\n*Mad words spill like dust beneath the brush,*\n*Left for the foolish ears of this fleeting age.\"*\n\nThen, he ascended the Bǎoguāng Hall and departed in truth, filling the room with strange fragrance. His disciples lit incense and bowed in farewell. As they wept, attendants Zhāng Zhìsù and Wǔ Zhìjù hurried to stop them, saying: *\"The True Person has left behind instructions: Let Sòng Dào’ān oversee the teaching, Yǐn Zhìpíng assist him, Zhāng Zhìsōng next, and Wáng Zhìmíng continue his former duties. Sòng Défāng and Lǐ Zhìcháng shall also deliberate on teaching matters.\"* They then recited the farewell poem again, and Sòng Dào’ān and the others bowed twice in acceptance.\n\nAt dawn, they donned mourning robes and performed funeral rites. Tens of thousands rushed to attend the funeral.\n\nWhen the imperial envoy Liú Zhònglù heard of this, he was stunned and sighed: *\"Since the True Person’s audience with the sovereign, the bond between ruler and subject was harmonious. After his departure from the capital, the emperor’s affection never waned. Now that the Master has ascended, I must swiftly report this.\"*\n\nAfter the first seven days of mourning, Daoists and lay devotees from all directions arrived to attend the funeral, grieving as if for a lost parent.\n\nThus, those seeking instruction in the Dao’s name grew ever more numerous.\n\nOne day, the overseer Sònggōng said to Zhìcháng: *\"This month’s seventh day marks when you and I together received the Master’s final teachings. Matters of the Dao’s name and such—you shall draft the documents in my handwriting and seal them with my mark. This practice shall continue as before.\"*\n\nSoon after, the Pure Harmony Master Yǐngōng arrived from Déxīng to conduct the rites. When the seven days of mourning concluded, the overseer Sònggōng said to Pure Harmony: *\"I am old and cannot uphold the Dao’s affairs. You may now take my place and lead them.\"* After declining twice, Pure Harmony accepted the charge, and near and far, those who followed the Way gathered, their numbers no fewer than before.\n\nOn the first day of the third month of the *Wùzǐ* year, Pure Harmony proposed building a hall for the Master at Báiyún Guàn. Some objected: *\"The labor is immense, and provisions scarce—this may not succeed.\"* Pure Harmony replied: *\"All things must be considered beforehand. Though one may share in success, one cannot share in planning from the start. If the matter serves no private gain and the Dao’s community exerts its full strength, what cannot be accomplished? Moreover, the Master’s enduring virtue remains with the people—who among the four quarters would not revere him? No need for further persuasion; there will be those who spontaneously aid this cause. If not, let the common funds be exhausted, and each take only a single ladleful—this would be my wish.\"*\n\nThe imperial envoy Liúgōng, hearing this, rejoiced and lent his full support. He then commissioned Jūzhì Yuányuán and others to oversee the work. From the fourth month’s *Dīng* day, they cleared the site and laid the foundation, spanning the *Wù*, *Jǐ*, and *Gēng* months. Soon, Daoists from Píngyáng, Tàiyuán, Jiān, Dài, Yù, and Yìng—over two hundred in total—brought provisions and labor, willingly constructing the hall. In forty days, the work was complete, though the names of all who contributed cannot be fully recorded. Some remarked that though human effort achieved the structure, the sages’ unseen influence must have sustained it.\n\nThe grand burial was set for the ninth day of the seventh month. Throughout June, incessant rain fell, raising fears it would disrupt the rites. On the seventh day’s first auspicious moment, word came of clear skies, and all hearts rejoiced in harmony. The day before, at the rites’ outset, incense was lit and offerings set forth to solemnize the ceremony. When the coffin was opened, the Master’s form remained intact, as if alive. Officials and commoners, monks and nuns, and all who gathered—over ten thousand across three days—pressed their hands to their brows in awe of his divine presence. News spread far and wide, drawing countless devotees to pay their respects, beyond number.\n\nThe temple then established a three-day *Fèng’ān* Daoist ritual, announcing a ten-day fast in advance. On the ninth day, at the *Chén* hour, a [Playen] *Xuànhè* crane arrived from the southwest, followed by a white crane, startling all who beheld them. After the *Zǐ* hour, a *Língbǎo Qīngjiào* exorcism was performed for the 360 degrees of the cosmos. When the rites concluded, the Master’s immortal remains were enshrined in the hall, filling the air with an unearthly fragrance that lingered for hours. At noon, the *zhāi* (vegetarian repast) was offered, with thousands in yellow robes and ceremonial attire, and ten thousand more adherents in attendance. After the rites, on the following day, heavy rain fell anew. All marveled: *\"Heaven and earth, above and below, in perfect accord—this great affair could not have been accomplished were it not for the Master’s virtue, complete and transcendent, harmonizing with the cosmos and the divine. Who else could achieve such wonders? Truly, this surpasses mere human power.\"*\n\nThe provisional chancellor and pacification commissioner, Wánggōng Jùchuān of Hányáng, a scion of the great clans, had long admired the [Playen] *Xuànhè* tradition. In recent years, he had also met with the Master’s father in Yān, sharing kindred spirit and aligned Dao. His reverence now exceeded even his past devotion. Thus, for this burial, he took the lead. Across the capital and its outskirts, troops were stationed, prepared for any contingency.\n\nThe Master then dismissed them, and there was no disturbance at all.\n\nAt that time, he inscribed upon his hall: **\"Chùshùn\"** (处顺), and upon his observatory: **\"Bái Yún\"** (白云焉). The Master composed texts without first drafting outlines—at the moment of writing, his brush flowed freely and the works were complete. Later, when others sought his teachings, he sometimes added or subtracted to them himself, thus preserving both versions.\n\nOnce, in a night conversation, he spoke to his disciples, saying: *\"The ancient ones who attained the Dao, those recorded in books and annals, were briefly mentioned but not fully transmitted. Those who lost their transmission—how many could they truly recount? I have often spoken to your assembly of the Dao-attainers of recent times, all those whom I have seen and heard in person, whose deeds and words are most detailed and whose teachings are most clear. In my leisure, I intended to compile the Complete Transmission of the True Dao to bequeath it to future generations. Since the Master’s passing, though I have occasionally spoken of its essence, the scholars of later times have yet to see its written form—alas, what a pity!\"*\n\nHis disciples who followed him were:\n**Xūjìng** (虚静) Mr. Zhào Dàojiān (赵道坚),\n**Chōngxū** (冲虚) Master Sòng Dào’ān (宋道安),\n**Qīnghé** (清和) Master Yǐn Zhìpíng (尹志平),\n**Xūjí** (虚寂) Master Sūn Zhìjiān (孙志坚),\n**Qīngzhēn** (清贞) True Person Xià Zhìchéng (夏志诚),\n**Qīngxū** (清虚) Master Sòng Défāng (宋德方),\n**Bǎoguāng** (葆光) Master Wáng Zhìmíng (王志明),\n**Chōngxū** (冲虚) Master Yú Zhìkě (于志可),\n**Chóngdào** (崇道) Master Zhāng Zhìsù (张志素),\n**Tōngzhēn** (通真) Master Jū Zhìyuán (鞠志圆),\n**Tōng｛yuán｝［xuán］** (通元) Master Lǐ Zhìcháng (李志常),\n**Yīzhēn** (颐真) Master Zhèng Zhìxiū (郑志修),\n**｛Yuán｝［Xuán］zhēn** (玄真) Master Zhāng Zhìyuǎn (张志远),\n**Wùzhēn** (悟真) Master Mèng Zhìwěn (孟志稳),\n**Qīngzhēn** (清真) Master Qí Zhìqīng (綦志清),\n**Bǎozhēn** (保真) Master Hé Zhìqīng (何志清),\n**Tōng｛yuán｝［xuán］** (通元) Master Yáng Zhìjìng (杨志静),\nand **Chōnghé** (冲和) Master Pān Déchōng (潘德冲).\n\nFour Mongols were specially granted to serve as his disciples and guardians:\n**Měnggǔ Dǎ** (蒙古打),\n**Hē Lā Bāhǎi** (喝剌八海),\n**Xuānchāi Ālìxiān** (宣差阿里鲜),\nand **Xuānchāi Biànyíshǐ Liú Zhònglù** (宣差便宜使刘仲禄).\n\n---\n\n**Imperial Edict** (Appendix to *Records of the Western Journey of the Long Spring True Person*, *Homage to the Master of the Homogeneous Book* First Edition)\nThe **Chéngjīsī** (成吉思) Emperor decreed to the True Person Qiū Shī (丘师):\n\n*\"I have fully taken note of your petition in response to my summons. Indeed, the Master: his Dao surpasses that of the Three Sons, his virtue is profound and manifold. I command my ministers to honor your original credentials and dispatch swift messengers to seek you among the distant seas. At this time, your wishes align with Heaven’s—no distance is too great for mortals. Though summoned by two courts and yet you did not come, a single envoy’s invitation sufficed for you to rise. You say that my Heavenly mandate is the reason you return. You do not shirk exposure to wind and frost, willingly enduring toils upon the sands. When your letter arrived, my joy and relief were boundless! Matters of war and statecraft are not what I seek; rather, it is the heart of Dao and virtue that truly merits praise. That chieftain’s insolence has been met with my retribution. Now, as the armies take the field and the borders are secured, your coming and departure are but a matter of natural force—long absent, now briefly present, I hope he will submit in spirit before I cease. Thus, I bear your fame and virtue aloft, and momentarily halt my troops. I recall that the Cloud Pavilion was launched from Penglái (蓬莱), and the Crane Chariot may traverse the lands of Tiānzhú (天竺). When Dharma advanced eastward, the True Seal of the Original Print was transmitted to the heart; when the Old Master journeyed westward, he sometimes transformed the barbarians and attained the Dao. Though the paths may be wide, gazing upon your staff and sandals, they are not distant. Hence, I reply to your letter to make clear my intent. In this autumn heat, may the Master’s peace be as good as ever, and may his fingers not tire from writing.\"*\n\n**Sacred Decree**, the first of four (Appendix to *Records of the Western Journey of the Long Spring True Person*, *Homage to the Master of the Homogeneous Book* First Edition)\nThe **Chéngjīsī** (成吉思) Emperor’s Sacred Decree to all officials of every region:\n\n*\"The abodes and halls of practice where the Qiū Immortal (丘神仙) has resided—these are the places where, day and night, the people have recited scriptures and prayed to Heaven, offering congratulations to the Emperor for his countless years of longevity—all such places, large or small, are hereby exempted from all taxes and levies.

      "translated_text": "**The Record of Master Zhāngchūn’s Western Journey (Yuan) by Lǐ Zhìcháng**\n\nMaster Zhāngchūn, surnamed Qiū, given name Chǔjī, courtesy name Tōngmì, a native of Jìngzhou’s Qīxiá, had not yet received his cap when he left home and became a disciple of Master Zhòngyáng. He dwelled at Pánxī and Lóngmén for thirteen years, where his true energy and perseverance matured, and his understanding of the Dao/Way was fulfilled. In his later years, he returned to the seaside.\n\nBefore the year *Wùyín*, Master was in Jìngzhou, and the officials of Hénán repeatedly sought to dispatch envoys to summon him, but matters were delayed and thus not carried out. The following year, he resided at Lái State’s Hào Tiān Guān.\n\nIn the fourth month of summer, envoys from Hénán’s borderlands came to invite him to accompany them. Master declined, and the envoys returned with his inscribed poems and verses of praise.\n\nLater, another envoy arrived from Dà Liáng, only to depart upon learning that Shāndōng was still held by the Sòng forces.\n\nThat same year, in the eighth month, the Grand Marshal of Jiāngnán, Lǐ Gōng Quán and Péng Gōng Yìbīn, came to request his presence, but Master did not go. Afterward, invitations came from various places, and the officials of Lái State found the task difficult. Master then declared:\n\n*\"My comings and goings are determined by Heaven. It is not something that mortals like you can comprehend. There will be times when I cannot be detained—then I shall depart.\"*\n\nSoon after, Chéngjìsī, the Emperor, sent his attendant Lǐu Zhònglù with a *Jīntóu* (golden) decree, its wording:\n\n*\"If I were to personally go, you may act as you see fit.\"*\n\nThen, twenty Mongol envoys arrived in succession, transmitting imperial edicts urging his attendance. As Master hesitated, Zhònglù said:\n\n*\"Master’s name is renowned across the four seas. The Emperor specially commissioned me, Zhònglù, to cross mountains and oceans without limit of time, and I am determined to bring you back.\"*\n\nMaster replied:\n\n*\"Since the turmoil of war, boundaries shift between realms. You have braved dangers to reach me—your efforts are indeed great.\"*\n\nZhònglù said:\n\n*\"I have received the sovereign’s command and dare not withhold my utmost strength.\"*\n\nIn the fifth month of that year, Zhònglù received the decree in *Nuòmǎn Guó* (Naiman Country) at *Wùlǐduō*.\nIn the sixth month, he arrived at *Báidēng* (White Mountain) in *Wēiníng* (威宁), where he received word from the winged envoy *Chángzhēn*.\nIn the seventh month, he reached *Déxīng* (德兴), but the *Yùyōng* (居庸) road was obstructed, so the officials of *Yānjīng* (燕京) dispatched soldiers to escort him.\nIn the eighth month, he reached the capital, where the Daoist community murmured:\n\n*\"Whether Master will stay or go is uncertain.\"*\n\nPassing through *Zhōngshān* (中山) and *Zhēndìng* (真定), rumors spread that Master was in *Dōnglái* (东莱). They then encountered the *Ānfù Sī* (安抚司) officials of *Yìdōu Fù* (益都府), Wú Yàn and Jiǎng Yuán, who finally provided accurate details. They planned to send five thousand soldiers to welcome Master.\n\nYàn and the others said:\n\n*\"The people of Jīngdōng, hearing that the two courts are discussing peace, have grown somewhat tranquil. If we suddenly advance with troops, they will surely fortify their strongholds and resist us—Master may even flee by boat to the seaside. If you truly wish to succeed, it need not be this way.\"*",

      "translated_text": "「Following his lead, they then conscripted volunteers and gathered twenty riders to proceed.\n\nAs they neared Yìdōu, they dispatched Wú Yàn and Jiǎng Yuán to hasten a report to their commander, Zhāng Lín. Lín sent ten thousand armored soldiers to greet them. Zhòng Lǚ laughed and said:\n\n*\"Why must we pass through here? It is only to seek an audience with the Immortal Master of Spring’s Eternal Bloom. Why do you send armored soldiers?\"*\n\nLín then dismissed his troops, and together they entered, instructing their men to hold their reins. Along the way, they shared these words with all, and no one harbored treacherous schemes. Lín further provided them with mounted couriers.\n\nAt Wèi Zhōu, they encountered Yǐn Gōng.\n\nIn the twelfth month of winter, they arrived together at Dōnglái and conveyed the Emperor’s decree for their summons. The Master, knowing he could not decline, slowly said to Zhòng Lǚ:\n\n*\"Here, food is scarce. You and the others may first return to Yìdōu. Await my completion of the *Shàngyuán Jiào* (上元醮) ritual, and I shall send fifteen riders to meet you. On the eighteenth day, I will depart.\"*\n\nThus, the Imperial envoys and their retinue headed west toward Yìdōu, selecting nineteen disciples beforehand to await their arrival. When the appointed day came, the riders arrived, and they proceeded together.\n\nFrom Wèi Yáng to Qīng Shè, the Imperial envoys had already left. Zhāng Lín reported:\n\n*\"On the seventh day of the first month, four hundred cavalrymen appeared at Línqí, causing great alarm among the Qīng citizens. The envoys intercepted and halted them, but they have yet to be heard from.\"*\n\nThe Master then passed through Chángshān and Zōu Píng, reaching Jì Yáng in early February. The commoners and officials offered incense and bows to welcome him at the southern gate of the town, while the Daoist disciples led the procession in advance. They were fed at the Yǎngsù Ān (养素庵).\n\nThe gathered crowd declared:\n\n*\"Last month, on the eighteenth day, over ten cranes came from the northwest, soaring and calling among the clouds before flying southeast. The next day, at the hour of Chén and Sì, more cranes arrived from the southwest, followed by hundreds and thousands. Some perched, some hovered, flitting around the roof of the hall before departing. Now we understand: whenever cranes appeared, it marked the day the Master set out.\"*\n\nAll raised their hands to their foreheads in reverence.\n\nAfter several days, in the early part of February, the Imperial envoys sent mounted couriers with word:\n\n*\"We have stationed troops at Jiānglíng and moored boats to await you.\"*\n\nThe Master departed the next day. On the thirteenth day, the Imperial envoys arrived with their army to escort him. The Master asked:\n\n*\"Why have you come so late?\"*\n\nThey replied:\n\n*\"The roads were obstructed. We went to Yànjīng to assemble troops, preparing the east for Xīn’ān and the west for Chángshān. Zhòng Lǚ personally led the army to seize Shēnzhōu and conquer Xià Wǔyìng to clear the path, built bridges over the Hùtú, and gathered boats at Jiānglíng—this is why we were delayed.\"*\n\nThe Master said:\n\n*\"This task could only be accomplished by you.\"*\n\nThe following day, they crossed the Hùtú and headed north. On the twenty-second day, they reached Lúgōu, where officials, commoners, monks, and Daoists came to greet them along the road.\n\nThat day, they entered through the Lìzé Gate, with Daoists arrayed in solemn rites chanting before them. The *Xíngshěng* official Shílù Gōng hosted the Master at the Yùxū Guàn (玉虚观), and from then on, those seeking blessings or inscriptions filled his doorstep.\n\nWherever the Master’s retinue passed, Daoist disciples invoked his name to shield the people from military calamities, often averting the misfortune of conscription. The Master’s influence and teachings reached people in such a manner.\n\nThe *Xuānfù* official Wáng Jùchuān composed a poem on his boat, and the Master responded:\n\n*\"Banners flutter, horses neigh in the north,\nGazing eastward toward Yàn’s crossing of the stone bridge.\nTen thousand miles beyond the desert’s sands,\nThree springs suddenly parted from the distant seas.\n\nKindred friends depart the frontier, returning like geese,\nTattered hats endure frost, yet fur coats mend.\nSince leaving the Western Shù in the days of yore,\nNone like the summons to the Northern Court.\"*\n\nThe Master heard that the Imperial retinue was moving westward, and as the seasons grew late, he grew weary of wind and frost, wishing to wait until their return to pay homage at court. Meanwhile, Zhòng Lǚ intended to bring selected young women along, and the Master hesitated, saying:\n\n*\"The people of Qí offered women and music—Confucius left Rú.\nThough I dwell in the mountains, how could I travel with young women?\"*\n\nZhòng Lǚ then ordered *Hèlā* to hasten and report, while the Master also sent someone with a formal petition.\n\nOne day, someone requested an inscription on Yán Lìběn’s *Tàishàng Guòguān Tú* (太上过关图), which reads:\n\n*\"In the west of Shù Province, when parting from Hán’s Pass,\nThe barbarians bowed in reverence—\nThe Great Dao once more laid its foundations.\"*\n\nHe also showed two *gāthā* (偈) to the assembly. The first reads:\n\n*\"Chaos at dawn, chaos at dusk,\nLightness and wildness from ancient times to now.\nEmpty blossoms, empty stillness in thought—\nA heart that is both present and absent.\"*\n\nThe second reads:\n\n*\"Emotions stir with resolute force,\nThe Dao alone remains unyielding.\nEndure insults to tame the wild horses,\nSerene and unhurried through the years.\nIn early April, the crowd urged him to perform a *Jiào* (醮) ritual on the fifteenth day. The Master declined, saying:\n\n*\"Now, the war has not yet ceased. Many displaced souls have the fortune to glimpse the True Person and receive the blessings of the Dao. But the dead linger in endless night, unrelieved by offerings or salvation—there is no little regret among them.\"*\n\nThe Master agreed.\n\nAt the time, a great drought prevailed. On the fourteenth day, after the ritual began, heavy rain fell. The crowd feared the ceremony might be disrupted, but by midday, when the Master arrived at the altar to perform the rites, the skies cleared.\n\nThe crowd rejoiced and sighed:\n\n*\"Rain and clear skies follow human desire—\nCould one of such virtue and profundity move Heaven and Earth so effortlessly?\"*\n\nThe next day, the Master ascended the Yuǎnbǎo Hall (元宝堂) to deliver teachings.\n\nAt that moment, several cranes flew in from the northwest, and all gazed upward. As the ritual papers were burned, one sheet ascended into the sky and vanished, while five cranes circled and danced above it. The scholars and officials all said:\n\n*\"The Master’s utmost sincerity stirs Heaven and Earth.\"*\n\nThe aged Daoist of Nántáng, Zhāng Tiāndù’s son Zhāng Zhen, composed an ode praising the event; all the officials also wrote poems.\n\nWhen the ritual concluded, the Imperial envoy Liú Gōng accompanied the Master northward. Passing through Jūyōng, they encountered bandits at night to its north, who all knelt and withdrew in respect, saying:\n\n*\"Do not alarm our father-teacher.\"*\n\nIn May, the Master arrived at the Lóngyáng Guàn (龙阳观) in Déxīng to spend the summer, sending a poem to the officials of Yànjīng:\n\n*\"Ascending the Dao—where is it found in the wandering of the Spirit-boat?\nSouth, north, east, west all hold their own joys.\nThe emerald heights, where clouds and peaks meet, display Heaven’s grandeur,\nThe azure waves, where mist and markets rise, mark the rain’s path to the shore.\"*",

      "translated_text": "「The Spirit-boat sails through the Eight Extremes, though the void seems distant,\nThe Dao aligns with the Three Pure Ones—its path is never amiss.\nEven crossing the Weak Waters thirty times ten thousand,\nIn a moment, one ascends to the realm of the Immortals.\n\nAt that time, in the capital, my Daoist descendants—\nSun Zhōu (周楚卿), Yáng Biāo (杨彪仲文), Shī Yì (师谞才卿),\nLǐ Shì (李士谦子进), Liú Zhōngyòng (刘中用之),\nChén Shí (陈时可秀玉), Wú Zhāng (吴章德明),\nZhào Zhōnglì (赵中立正卿), Wáng Ruì (王锐威卿),\nZhào Fǎng (赵昉德辉), and Sūn Xǐ (孙锡天锡)—\nthese virtuous gentlemen were those with whom the Master conversed and exchanged verses\nwhile residing in Yùxū (玉虚).\nWáng Fèng (王觏逢辰) and Wáng Zhí (王直哉清甫) also joined him in his wanderings.\n\nThe observatory stood on the sunlit slopes of the mountain,\nwhere many caves and palaces abounded,\nand where practitioners of the Dao/Way often dwelled.\nThe Master thus led his disciples to explore them.\n\nUpon first entering the gorge, he composed a poem:\n*\"A Daoist’s leisurely journey here is doubly delightful,\nWith peaks and ridges arrayed like spears and shields in battle.\nThough Penglái’s realm remains beyond reach,\nThe grottoes already reveal the homes of the Daoists.\nThe pine towers sway in autumn rain and dew,\nThe stone pavilions gleam in evening clouds and mists.\nReflecting now on my former words about Zhōngnán’s lands,\nI wake from dreams—no end to the Western Mountains’ reach.\"*\n\nThe place was refreshing and elevated,\nits grandeur sloping toward the southeast,\nwhere a single gaze could span over three hundred *lǐ*.\nTo the east of the observatory, several *lǐ* away,\na spring welled up from the plain, its coolness most pleasing.\n\nThe Master traversed these lands often,\nand wrote another poem:\n*\"At midday, I walk with the wind to the observatory,\nGazing far upon the mountains, lost in a sea of clouds.\nWhile households endure scorching summer heat,\nA single breeze of cold spring water clears to the bone.\nIn the north, travelers sometimes trust in omens,\nBut here on the Eastern Mound, they play without contention—\n(Plowmen and shepherds yield their shade beneath the embankment.)\nAfter bathing by the stream and sitting in the forest,\nI loosen my hair, open my robe, and expound on the Dao/Way’s truths.\"*\n\nOn the Mid-Autumn Festival,\nthe observatory held its ritual.\nAt midday, talismans were transmitted and precepts conferred,\nand the elderly and young alike suffered from the intense heat,\nall lamenting their discomfort.\n\nIn a short while, clouds gathered above,\nshaped like a round canopy,\nand lingered for some time without dispersing.\nThe crowd rejoiced, leaping in praise.\n\nAgain, the well water sufficed for hundreds,\nbut now over a thousand drew from it,\nand those in charge sought alternative sources.\nFor three days, they dug elsewhere,\nyet the well’s spring suddenly overflowed,\nits supply inexhaustible—\nthese were all auspicious karmic blessings and Heaven’s aid.\n\nAfter the ritual, he inscribed a poem:\n*\"The Great Sage’s boundless compassion saves all living beings,\nTheir offerings of virtue made through the sacred scriptures.\nThe Three Fields protect the spirit and vital *qi*,\nAll phenomena bow in reverence to the sun, moon, and stars.\nThough my mortal flesh still harbors imperfections,\nI cannot evade the teachings that lead to the formless.\nI follow the North Dipper’s ritual fasts (both the South and North Dippers instruct the rites of abstinence),\nGradually ascending to the Southern Palace’s Fire-Refining Court.\nBy the eighth month, in response to the Imperial Envoy of Xuāndé Prefecture,\nGeneral Móliè (移剌公) who summoned me,\nI thus took up residence in the Cháoyuán Guàn (朝元观).\n\nOn the Mid-Autumn night, there were two congratulatory Daoist hymns.\nThe first:\n*\"The clouds dissolve into their peaks,\nThe vast sky congeals its jade—\nThe precious mirror now shines full.\nThe Great Radiance, its brilliance spanning endless deserts,\nExtends beyond the Western Heaven.\nHere in the mortal world, dreams and spirits are intoxicated,\nFeasting at a grand, adorned banquet.\nThe Daoist’s gate is another vessel of purity,\nSilently awakening the field of enlightenment within.\"*\n\nThe second:\n*\"In the depths of the Celestial Caverns,\nFine companions gather in high assembly,\nTheir unbounded leisure knows no end.\nAscending to the Upper Celestial Realm,\nThey fly to the Broad Cold Palace,\nCasually tossing down gold coins.\nThe Spirit-boat glows resplendently,\nChasing away the demon of sleep—\nThe jade hare dances with grace.\nSitting in forgetfulness, they perceive the original truth,\nLetting the *dharma*-realm revolve as it will.\nAfterward, the autumn air grew clear and serene,\nAnd the quiet night was peaceful.\n\nHe then composed two *jué* (绝句) verses:\n*\"The Milky Way stretches vast and deep through the night,\nSilent and lonely, my cold window holds countless thoughts.\nThe world’s strife and discord never reach this place,\nAnd in tranquil stillness, the Daoist’s heart finds ease.\"*\n\nThe second:\n*\"The night is deep and cool as the moon ascends,\nMountains and rivers, earth and sky, all vanish without trace.\nOnly the Dao/Way and virtue remain, their essence undimmed,\nSpanning the Three Heavens, ten thousand *lǐ* in reach.\nThe Cháoyuán Guàn stands at the prefecture’s dry corner,\nIts merit-holder, General Móliè (移剌公),\ndesiring the Master’s northern journey,\nbuilt halls and palaces anew,\nenshrined the honored image,\nand refreshed all the cloud chambers and grottoes.\nIn the tenth month, as the mural of the Patriarch was being painted,\nthe artist, chilled by the cold,\nwas about to halt his work.\nThe Master forbade it, saying:\n*'Zhōu Lǜ (邹律) could yet turn the spring—\nHow much more so the Sage’s shade, which lends support!'*\nThat month, indeed, the weather turned mild as spring,\nwith no wind or sand,\nso the artist completed his task.\nThere was a poem:\n*'Late spring in the borderlands, though harsh, shares the same cold;\nFlying stones and whirling sands stir great winds.\nMigratory geese, their wings drooping, hurry southward,\nTravelers weary, their northward journey endless.\nWhen I arrived in the tenth month, frost was still thin,\nAnd men marveled that streams flowed through the thousand peaks.\nHad it not been for the gentle warmth of the small spring,\nHeaven would not have fulfilled the mural’s completion.*\n\nSoon after, Ālǐ Xiān (阿里鲜) came from the camp of the Great Khan,\nYùwēn Dàwáng (斡辰大王),\nsent an envoy to request the Master’s presence.\nThen, the Imperial Pacifier, Wáng Jùchān (王公巨川),\nalso arrived, saying:\n*'By the Great Khan’s decree:\nIf the Master travels westward,\nhe may pass through my lands.'*\nThe Master assented.\n\nThat month, as he journeyed northward toward Wàngshān,\nHéliè (曷剌) submitted a memorial requesting his return,\nand there was an edict:\n*'By the decree of the Great Khan, Chéngjísī (成吉思) Emperor,\nto the True Person, Master Qiū (丘师).\nIt further states:\nOnly the Master’s Dao surpasses the Three Sages,\nHis virtue is profound and manifold.\nIts final words:\n*\"The Cloud Pavilion was launched from Penglái,\nThe Crane Chariot may wander in Indra’s realm.\nDàmó (达磨) marched eastward,\nTransmitting the seal of the Original Mind;\nLǎozǐ (老氏) journeyed westward,\nSometimes transforming into the Barbarian to attain the Dao/Way.\nThough the river’s path is wide,\nGazing upon the few steps and staff, it seems no distance at all.\nNow, in response to your letter,\nI make clear my intention.\"*\n\nIn autumn’s heat, the Master was in better health than usual.\nThough his age spared him much exertion,\nhis esteem was so great.\n\nThe Great Khan again decreed to Liú Zhōnglù (刘仲禄):\n*\"Do not let the True Person suffer hunger or toil,\nBut support him gently on his journey home.\"*\n\nThe Master conferred with the Imperial Envoy, saying:\n*\"The cold has already set in,\nAnd the sandy roads stretch far.\nWhat the Daoists require for their journey is not yet prepared—\nWe should return to Lóngyáng,\nAnd depart in the spring.\"*",
      "overlap_context": "who all knelt and withdrew in respect, saying:\n\n*\"Do not alarm our father-teacher.\"*\n\nIn May, the Master arrived at the Lóngyáng Guàn (龙阳观) in Déxīng to spend the summer, sending a poem to the officials of Yànjīng:\n\n*\"Ascending the Dao—where is it found in the wandering of the Spirit-boat?\nSouth, north, east, west all hold their own joys.\nThe emerald heights, where clouds and peaks meet, display Heaven’s grandeur,\nThe azure waves, where mist and markets rise, mark the rain’s path to the shore.\"*",

      "translated_text": "The Imperial Envoy complied with his words. On the eighteenth day, he journeyed south to Lóngyáng.\n\nAlong the Daoist path, friends bid farewell, many weeping in tears.\n\nThe Master composed a poem to show the assembly:\n*\"Temporary parting in life is still bearable,\nBut enduring separation after death is unbearable.\nThe world’s disputes unsettle the heart,\nWhile the Wheel of Rebirth and suffering’s bitterness are hard to accept.\"*\n\nThe following day, he arrived at the Lóngyáng observatory to spend the winter.\n\nOn the fourteenth day of the eleventh month, he went to the Lóngyán Temple (龍岩寺) to fast, and inscribed a poem on the western veranda of the hall:\n\n*\"With staff in hand, I seek the mountain recluse,\nYet empty waters stretch deep, pale and colorless.\nLast night, snowflakes filled the rocky peaks,\nToday, the mountain’s light mirrors the sky’s whiteness.\nThe heavens are high, the earth’s wind pure and clear,\nMy spirit wanders the Eight Extremes, rising in boundless luminosity.\nI wish to depict the mountain recluse’s true visage,\nBut the Daoist’s task is beyond mortal naming.\"*\n\nIn the twelfth month, he sent a poem to his Daoist friends in Yànjīng (燕京):\n\n*\"This journey is truly arduous,\nThis farewell must be long spoken.\nNorthward, I cross the Wild Fox Ridge,\nWestward, I reach the Heavenly Horse Land.\nThe Yīn Mountains lack the Sea of Ships,\nWhite grasses mark the battlefield’s sand.\nI lament my lack of sagehood—\nHow could I compare to those who traverse the Great Wilderness?\nHe also wrote:\nIf the capital has poems to mark my departure,\nSend them early to Lóngyáng before I cross the pass.\nIn days of old, some parted with shoes on the bed,\nNow, none dream of bidding farewell with staff in hand.\nAgain, he sent a poem to his Daoist friends in Yànjīng:\nTen years of war and fire, the people’s grief is endless,\nA thousand among ten thousand survive.\nLast year, I was spared by the Emperor’s gracious decree,\nThis spring, I must endure the cold and journey.\nI do not shun the three thousand northern leagues (the Emperor’s former domain),\nYet I still remember the two hundred eastern states.\nIn desperate straits, my breath is but a lingering sigh,\nEarly grant my life and fate relief from sorrow.\"*\n\nOn the eighth day of the second month of the Xīnwèi (辛巳) year, he set out, the weather clear and settled. Daoist friends saw him off in the western suburbs, blocking his horse’s head and weeping:\n\n*\"Our Master departs to the distant ten thousand leagues—\nWhen shall we again have the chance to pay our respects?\"*\n\nThe Master replied:\n*\"If your resolve in the Dao is firm and unyielding,\nYou will meet me again someday.\"*\n\nThe assembly wept once more and pleaded:\n*\"When, then, shall we meet?\"*\n\nThe Master said:\n*\"My journey’s progress is not within mortal control,\nAnd crossing distant lands is fraught with uncertainty—\nWhether my Dao will align or not, I cannot say for certain.\"*\n\nThe assembly said:\n*\"Our Master surely knows—\nWe beg you to inform your disciples.\"*\n\nUnable to refuse, he spoke again:\n*\"Three years to return, three years to return.\"*\n\nOn the tenth day, he rested at the Qí Gāng (翠帡) pass.\n\nThe next day, he crossed the Wild Fox Ridge to the north,\nAscended a height and gazed southward,\nSurveying the Tàiháng (太行) Mountains—\nThe misty peaks were lovely in the clear weather,\nBut to the north, only desolate sand and withered grass remained.\nFrom here, the winds of the Central Plains were forever cut off.\n\nThe Daoist’s heart knows no bounds—\nSong Défāng (宋德芳) and others pointed to the battlefield’s white bones,\nSaying:\n*\"When I return,\nI will offer them the Golden Talisman (金箓),\nFor this too is part of my northern journey’s karmic ties.\"*\n\nPassing through Fǔzhōu (抚州) to the north,\nOn the fifteenth day, he traveled northeast across the Gàilì (盖里) marshes,\nThrough endless salt flats and barren lands,\nBefore spotting the faintest signs of human habitation—\nTwenty or so households.\nTo the south, there were salt pools,\nStretching northeast in a winding line.\nFrom here, there were no rivers,\nAnd water was drawn from dug sand-wells.\nFor thousands of leagues north and south,\nThere were no towering mountains,\nAnd a horse could travel five days before reaching the border of Míngchāng (明昌).\nHe composed a poem to record the journey:\n\n*\"The slopes fold and twist, the road winding in circles,\nSalt fields and stagnant waters mark every turn.\nFor days, I meet no travelers,\nYet after years, horses still return.\nThe earth bears no trees, only wild grasses,\nThe heavens shape low hills, hiding great mountains.\nNo grains grow, but milk and cheese sustain,\nAnd furs or felt tents bring joy to the eye.\"*\n\nHe traveled another six or seven days,\nSuddenly entering the Great Sand Dunes (大沙陀).\nThere, the dunes had stunted willows,\nThe largest wide enough to encircle with one’s arms.\nBeyond a thousand leagues to the northeast,\nWhere the sands ended, no trees grew at all.\n\nOn the first day of the third month,\nHe left the Great Sand Dunes,\nReaching Yú’ér (鱼儿) marshes,\nWhere human settlements clustered together,\nMostly living by tilling fields or fishing.\nIt was already Qīngmíng (清明),\nThe spring hues faint and lingering,\nThe ice still frozen and unmelted.\n\nHe composed a poem:\n*\"The northern lands have always been bitterly cold,\nYet the Great Sand Dunes still hold ice in the third month.\nSeek the Yellow Crane among the recluse scholars,\nRecognize the Kite’s transformation into the Great Eagle.\nSū Wǔ’s northern exile filled him with despair,\nLǐ Líng’s southern gaze found no reliance.\nNow I return to study Lú Yào’s lofty resolve,\nAnd exhaustively observe the highest teachings.\"*\n\nOn the fifth day of the third month,\nHe departed northeastward,\nWhere human settlements stretched far in every direction,\nAll with black carts and white tents,\nFollowing the water and grass for grazing.\nAcross the plains and marshes,\nNot a single tree remained—\nOnly yellow clouds and white grasses as far as the eye could see.\n\nHe did not stray from his path,\nAnd after twenty more days,\nHe finally reached a Sand River (沙河),\nFlowing northwest into the Lùjú (陆局) River.\nThe water barely reached a horse’s belly,\nAnd reeds and thickets of willows grew along its banks.\nCrossing the river and traveling north for three days,\nHe entered the Small Sand Dunes (小沙陀).\n\nOn the first day of the fourth month,\nHe arrived beneath the Great Khan’s tent at Wòchén (斡辰).\nThe ice had just begun to thaw,\nAnd the grass showed the faintest signs of life.\nThere was a wedding celebration,\nAnd within five hundred leagues,\nLeaders sent horses and wagons to assist.\nBlack carts and white tents formed lines numbering thousands.\n\nOn the seventh day,\nHe met the Great Khan,\nWho inquired about prolonging life.\nThe Master said it required fasting and discipline before such teachings could be heard,\nAnd agreed to impart them on the next full moon.\n\nOn that day,\nA great snowstorm arose—\nAnd it ceased.\nThe Great Khan said:\n*\"The Emperor sent an envoy ten thousand leagues,\nSeeking your Daoist wisdom.\nHow dare I presume to ask first?\nMoreover, he instructed Alìxiān (阿里鲜),\n‘When you have seen the Master, return eastward,\nAnd ensure he passes through here.’\"*\n\nOn the seventeenth day,\nThe Great Khan sent a hundred head of cattle and horses,\nAnd ten carts to escort the Master on his way.\nThe Master rode northwest,\nAnd on the twenty-second day,\nHe reached the Lùjú (陆局) River,\nWhere the accumulated waters formed a vast sea,\nStretching hundreds of leagues around.\nThe winds churned waves that cast up great fish,\nWhich the Mongols caught in numbers.\n\nTraveling along the river’s southern bank westward,\nThey sometimes found wild scallions to eat.",

      "translated_text": "The journey continued four more stages. To the northwest, crossing the river, they reached a vast plain, its surrounding mountains and streams all splendid and graceful. To the east and west stood ancient cities, their foundations as if newly laid, their streets and alleys clearly marked, their architecture resembling that of the Central Plains.\n\nNo inscribed records of the years remained to verify their age, though some said they were built by the Khitans. Later, ancient tiles were found buried in the earth, bearing Khitan script—evidently cities established by those Khitan warriors who refused to surrender after the fall of Liao and retreated westward.\n\nIt was also said: \"To the southwest, at the city of Xúnsīgàn, a thousand leagues away, lies the finest region of the Uyghur land, where the Khitans once established their capital, spanning seven generations.\"\n\nOn the thirteenth day of the sixth month, they camped behind the Chángsōng Ridge, where towering pine trees stood dense and lofty, their branches stretching toward the heavens and blotting out the sun. Most grew in mountain shadows and ravines, while those on sunlit slopes were few.\n\nOn the fourteenth day, they passed through a mountain and crossed a shallow river, the air piercingly cold—even the strongest could barely endure.\n\nThat evening, they camped on level ground. On the fifteenth day, at dawn, their tents were encircled by thin ice. Three frosts had fallen, the river’s current sluggish, its chill like the depths of winter.\n\nThe locals remarked: *\"Even in the fifth and sixth months, snow often falls annually. This year, we are fortunate for the clear, warm weather.\"*\n\nThe expedition renamed the ridge **Dàhán Ridge**—for whenever rain came, it brought hail, and the mountain paths twisted like serpents. To the northwest, after another hundred leagues, they again turned northwest before finally reaching flat terrain. There, a **Stone River** ran for over fifty leagues, its banks towering a dozen zhang high, its waters crystal-clear and inviting, its sound like chiming jade.\n\nBetween the sheer cliffs, giant leeks grew three to four feet tall, and upon the ravine’s edge stood pines, each a dozen zhang in height. The western mountains stretched endlessly, their tall pines clustering thickly.\n\nAfter five or six days of mountain travel, the peaks curved and the paths wound, while forests and ridges grew ever more lush. Beneath them, streams poured down. The plains were a mix of pine and birch, as if inhabited by people.\n\nThey then ascended a towering ridge, its grandeur like a vast rainbow, its cliffs rising a thousand ren high. Gazing down, they saw a deep lake—so vast it seemed to swallow men whole.\n\nOn the twenty-eighth day, they anchored east of **Wōlǐduō**, where the **Propagator** (宣抚) submitted a memorial to the **Empress Dowager** (皇后), requesting the expedition’s permission to cross the river by decree. The river flowed northeast, its waters spreading wide and deep, its current impassable—yet they forded it.\n\nEntering the camp, their carriages halted on the southern bank. The encampment stretched for thousands of tents, their supplies of fermented mare’s milk and curdled yogurt. The **Princesses of the Han and Xia** (汉、夏公主) sent winter provisions and food, including millet and white gold (silver) by the measure of ten taels per bushel. Fifty taels could be exchanged for eighty jin of flour—a flour that came from beyond the **Yīnshān Mountains**, carried by **Western merchant camels** (西域贾胡) from two thousand leagues away.\n\nWithin their tents, no flies were found. **Wōlǐduō** (窝里朵) was a **palace on wheels** (行宫) in the Han tongue, its pavilions and banners standing proud—even the ancient **Great Chanyu** (大单于) had never seen such splendor.\n\nOn the ninth day of the seventh month, they traveled southwest with the **Propagator’s envoy** (宣使) for five or six days. Often, they saw snow atop the mountains, and tombs scattered below. Upon reaching the **High Mound** (高陵), they found traces of ancestral worship.\n\nAfter another three days, they passed a mountain—its peak sheer as a blade, its pines and firs dense and thriving. There lay a lake, and beyond it, a great gorge opened to the south, where a river flowed westward. On its sunlit banks, thickets of mixed wood cast dappled shade, while wild chives grew lush as fragrant grass, lining the path for dozens of leagues.",

      "translated_text": "The Master traversed myriad mountains and ten thousand rivers—\nUnknown where this place might be.\n\nAfter four days, he reached the imperial encampment.\nThe Emperor sent a great minister, **Hè Lā Bó Dé Lái** (喝剌播得來), to welcome him,\nOn the fifth day of the fourth month.\n\nThe lodgings were arranged, and he entered to pay his respects.\nThe Emperor greeted him, saying: *\"Other lands’ summons he refuses,\nYet here, crossing ten thousand leagues, you come—\nI rejoice greatly in this.\"*\n\nThe Master replied: *\"The humble ones of the wilderness obey the edict by fate.\nIt is the heavens’ will.\"*\n\nThe Emperor delighted, granted him a seat,\nAnd after the meal inquired: *\"Master, having journeyed so far,\nDo you possess any elixir of longevity to aid me?\"*\n\nThe Master said: *\"There is the **Way of Hygiene** (衛生之道),\nBut no elixir of longevity.\"*\n\nThe Emperor praised his honesty,\nAnd set up two pavilions in the eastern part of his own tent for his residence.\n\nThe translator asked: *\"Do people call you **Téngchīlì Mǒnggǔ Kǒng** (腾吃利蒙古孔)?\nOr do you claim that title yourself?\"*\n\nThe Master said: *\"The wilderness does not name itself—\nIt is what others call me.\"*\n\nThe translator pressed again: *\"What was your old name?\"*\nAnd the Master answered: *\"In the wilderness, four men sought the **Way** from the **Revered Master of the Double Yang** (重陽師),\nThree have already ascended—\nOnly the wilderness remains, and people call me **Master** (先生).\"*\n\nThe Emperor asked **Zhèn Hǎi** (鎮海): *\"What title should the Master bear?\"*\n**Zhèn Hǎi** reported: *\"Some honor him as **Master Father** (師父),\nOthers as **Master of the Way** (真人) or **Immortal** (神仙).\"*\n\nThe Emperor said: *\"From now on, you may be called **Immortal**.\"*\n\nAt this time, the heat was intense,\nSo the imperial retinue camped beneath the snowy peaks to escape it.\nThe Emperor scheduled a **Way-inquiry** (問道) for the fourteenth of the fourth month,\nWith **Dà Zhèn Hǎi** (田鎮海), **Liú Zhòng Lù** (劉仲禄), and **Ālǐ Xiān** (阿里鮮) recording it externally,\nAnd three close attendants taking notes within.\n\nNews came of **Huíhuá** (回纥) bandits harassing the passes,\nAnd the Emperor, desiring to lead the campaign himself,\nChanged the auspicious day to the tenth month.\n\nThe Master begged to return to his old lodgings,\nBut the Emperor said: *\"Come again—\nWould that not be too much labor?\"*\n\nThe Master replied: *\"Two weeks will suffice.\"*\n\nThe Emperor said again: *\"There will be no escort.\"*\nThe Master answered: *\"There is **Xuānchāi Yáng Āgǒu** (宣差楊阿狗).\"*\n\nAfter three more days,\n**Āgǒu** (阿狗) was ordered to supervise the **Huíhuá** (回纥) chieftains,\nWith over a thousand cavalry accompanying him on the journey.\nThey returned by another route.\n\nThe Master then ascended the great mountains—\nThere was a **Stone Gate** (石門), its cliffs sharp as if cut from wax,\nA massive rock spanning above like a bridge.\nBelow, the current was swift,\nAnd soldiers urged their donkeys to cross—\nThe donkeys drowned, and corpses littered the banks.\nThis was a **pass**, newly breached by troops.\n\nEmerging from the gorge,\nHe composed two verses.\n\nThe first reads:\n*\"North of the water, the Iron Gate still stands firm,\nBut south of the water, the Stone Gorge is too dreadful to behold.\nThe cliffs rise sheer, their peaks scraping the heavens,\nWhile the ravine’s cold waves surge, earth-shaking in their descent.\nAlong the path, drowned bodies choke the air—men clap their hands to their noses,\nAnd I, with ears long as the **Qiang** (涧), am moved to sorrow.\nTen years of war, ten thousand leagues—when will the soldiers return,\nAnd restore the land to **Great Peace** (太平)?\"*\n\nThe second reads:\n*\"The **Snowy Peaks** (雪岭) gleam white, leaning against the sky,\nWhile dawn’s light shimmers below, bathing the river’s flow.\nGazing upward, men cross the cliffs on ropes,\nLooking down, the pines hang inverted from the perilous crags.\nThe **May Wind** (五月) blows fierce and cold upon my face,\nYet the **Three-Jiao Fever** (三焦热病) has already healed.\nI came to expound the **Way**, but now only turn my head in vain—\nI await the next auspicious hour to descend to the **Lower Realm** (下元).\"*\n\nWhen the Master first arrived to pay homage,\nThe third month had ended,\nGrasses and trees flourished, and sheep and horses grew fat.\nBy the time he received the edict to depart,\nThe fourth month had passed—\nAll the plants withered away.\n\nHe composed another verse:\n*\"The foreign lands are deep and vast, their affairs beyond reckoning,\nYet the **Dao’s** (道) **yin-yang** (陰陽) and seasonal rhythms are utterly unknown here.\nScarcely had I passed the fourth month when the **Yin Demons** (陰魔) vanished—\n*(For in spring and winter, the rains persist, but in the fourth month, the **Pure Yang** (純陽) reigns, and there is no rain.)*\nNow I laugh at the **Drought Demon** (旱魃), fierce across the heavens.\nThe waters nourish the ten thousand streams in **High Summer** (九夏),\nYet the plants are ravaged as if by **Late Winter** (三冬).\n\nI have traveled back and forth three thousand leagues—\n*(Departing in the third month, returning in the fifth.)*\nNo traveler I meet bears the mark of rain.\nI encountered soldiers returning from the **Western Campaign** (征西),\nMany bearing **coral** (珊瑚).\nOne official exchanged two **catty of white gold** (白金二镒) for ten stalks—\nNearly fifty in all, the tallest over a foot high—\nBut they were won in battle, and so could not be fully preserved.\n\nOn the **Evening of the Double Wu** (重午), he set out for cooler lands.\nBy the fifth or sixth day,\nHe reached **Yǎmǐsīgàn Dàshí** (邪米思干, the Great Stone of **Hézhōngfǔ** (河中府)),\nWhere the officials welcomed him into the lodgings.\nThis was the day of the **Double Wu** (重午).\n\n---\n**The Master’s Western Journey Record (二)** (Longchun Zhenren Xiyou Ji, Volume Two)\n**Master Li** (李公) departed eastward,\nAnd sent verses to the **Daoists of the East** (東方道眾), saying:\n\n*\"At that time, from the seaside city I set out,\nWhile the **Way’s** (道) **dryness and martial strife** (海上干戈) still raged unchecked.\nTo awaken the **Dao of Virtue and Way** (道德) beyond the thousand leagues,\nI did not shrink from the dust and winds of the **Nine Barbarians’** (九夷) lands.\n\nFirst, I climbed the **High Ridge of the West-North** (西北高岭),\n*(That is, the **Wild Fox Ridge** (野狐岭).)*\nGradually turning east-south,\nI pointed toward the **Upper Capital** (上京).\n*(Standing on the eastern bank of the **Lù Jú** (陸局) River,\nI gazed east-south toward the **Upper Capital**.)*\n\nThen I descended southwestward—\n*(Southwest four thousand leagues to **Wùlǐduō** (兀里朵),\nThen another two thousand leagues southwest to the **Yin Mountains** (阴山).)*\nBeyond the **Yin Mountains** (阴山), the name of the land is lost.\n*(Southwest of the **Yin Mountains**, there is a range of great mountains,\nAnd a lesser stream, stretching thousands of leagues to the great city of **Yǎmǐsīgàn** (邪米思干),\nWhere the Master’s lodgings were in the old palace.)*\n\nThe Master had returned to his lodgings,\nWhich were built upon the northern cliffs,\nOverlooking a clear stream ten *zhang* deep.\nThe stream came from the **Snowy Mountains** (雪山),\nAnd was bitterly cold.\n\nIn **Mid-Summer** (仲夏), the heat was fierce,\nSo he reclined in the northern veranda, fanning himself.\nAt night, he slept upon the **Peak Platform** (屋颠之台).\n\nWhen the **Extreme Heat** (极暑) of the sixth month came,\nHe bathed in a pool.\n\nThus the Master adapted to life in this distant realm.\nThe soil of **Hézhōngfǔ** (河中府) was fertile for all grains,\nYet lacked **barley** (荞麦) and **large soybeans** (大豆).\nIn the fourth month, the wheat ripened,\nAnd the locals harvested it, piling it haphazardly on the ground.\nWhen needed, they would thresh it—\nThe work was finished by the sixth month.\n\n**Master Li**, the **Tí Kòng** (提控) of the **Tàishīfǔ** (太师府),\nOffered a five-*mǔ* (亩) melon field,\nWhose fruit was supremely sweet and fragrant—\nA taste unknown in the Central Lands,\nWith some as large as a **dou** (斗) measure.\n\nIn the sixth month,\nThe two **Princes** (太子) returned,\nAnd **Liú Zhòng Lù** (劉仲禄) begged for melons to present to them—\nTen could weigh as much as a **burden** (一担).\n\nThe fruits and vegetables were abundant,\nOnly lacking **taro** (芋) and **chestnuts** (栗).\"",

      "translated_text": "The Master then said: *\"To the east of the Huíhé city, there are two thousand households who have recently rebelled. Night after night, their fires illuminate the city, unsettling the people. The Tàishī should return to pacify them.\"*\n\nThe Tàishī replied: *\"If, along the way, there should be any unforeseen dangers, what then?\"*\n\nThe Master said: *\"What concern is that to the Tàishī?\"*\nAnd so he returned.\n\nOn the twelfth day, they passed through Jiéshí City.\nOn the thirteenth day, they received a thousand foot soldiers and three hundred armored cavalry for escort, then entered the great mountains—this was the alternate path outside the Iron Gate.\n\nThey crossed the Red Water Ravine, where towering peaks rose thousands of *lǐ* high.\nTraveling southeast through the valley, a saline spring flowed from the mountain’s roots. When it dried, it became white salt, so they collected two *dòu* to carry along for use. Further southeast, they ascended the Dividing Ridge, where to the west, a deep ravine gleamed like ice—this too was salt. On the mountain’s slopes, red salt lay like stone, which the Master himself had tasted.\n\nIn the east, salt is mined from the earth; here in these lands, it also emerges from the mountains.\nThe Huíhé people eat flatbreads and crave salt. When thirsty, they drink water, and in winter’s cold, the poor even carry bread to sell.\n\nOn the fourteenth day, they reached the southern slopes of the Iron Gate’s western pass, preparing to leave the mountains.\nThe mountain pass was steep and treacherous, with a collapsed cliff on the left, where the ravine’s waters flowed hidden for about one *lǐ*.\nAt mid-autumn, they arrived at the riverbank, its current vast as the Yellow River, flowing northwest. They crossed by boat and camped on its southern shore.\n\nTo the west lay a mountain stronghold named Tuánbālā, its terrain rugged and fortified.\nThe Third Prince’s medical officer, Master Zhèng, encountered them along the way and presented a poem:\n\n*\"Since ancient times, the mid-autumn moon shines brightest,\nIts cool breeze arriving with the season, the night ever clearer.\nThe heavens’ breath hangs like silver in the Milky Way,\nWhile fish and dragons gleam in the water’s crystalline light.\nFrom Wu and Yue, the towers hum with music and revelry,\nFrom Yan and Qin, the troops feast with wine and delicacies.\nI stand before Your Majesty by the river’s edge,\nHoping to lay down arms and restore the Great Peace.\"*\n\nThey traveled thirty *lǐ* southeast along the river before reaching dry land, then continued by night.\nThey passed through Bānlí City, vast and still echoing with distant barking—its people had recently rebelled and fled.\nAt dawn, after breaking their fast, they traveled east for several *lǐ* until they found a north-flowing stream, barely fordable by horse. They rested and camped on the eastern bank.\n\nOn the twenty-second day, Dànhàn Zhèn welcomed them from the east, escorting them to the Imperial encampment. The Emperor sent Zhèn to ask: *\"Do you wish to see me now? Or would you prefer to rest awhile?\"*\n\nThe Master replied: *\"I wish to enter and pay my respects.\"*\nHe added: *\"Those who follow the Dao have never knelt before the Emperor. Upon entering the tent, one stands with hands clasped—no further ceremony.\"*\n\nAfter the audience, they were granted fermented mare’s milk until they took their leave.\nThe Emperor then asked: *\"Are your provisions in the city sufficient?\"*\nThe Master answered: *\"The Mongols and Huíhé have long been supplied by the Tàishī. Recently, food has grown scarce, and the Tàishī alone has managed it.\"*\n\nThe next day, the Emperor sent an attendant to convey: *\"Would it be acceptable for the True Person to come daily for meals?\"*\nThe Master replied: *\"One who cultivates the Dao in the wilderness seeks only quietude.\"*\nThe Emperor granted his request as he pleased.\n\nOn the twenty-seventh day, the Imperial procession turned north. Along the way, they were repeatedly given grapes, melons, and tea cakes.\nOn the first day of the ninth month, they crossed the river bridge and headed north.\n\nThe Master petitioned: *\"The appointed time for our discussion approaches. The Tàishī Ahǎi should be summoned.\"*\n\nOn the month’s full moon, the Emperor set up a pavilion for a solemn fast, dismissing the attendants. Lamplight blazed as the Master, the Tàishī Ahǎi, and Alī Xiān entered the tent.\nHe declared: *\"Commissioner Zhònglù has traveled ten thousand *lǐ* to attend, and Zhèn has journeyed thousands to escort me. They too should be admitted to hear the Dao’s discourse.\"*\n\nBoth men were summoned in, and whatever the Master spoke was translated by the Tàishī into Mongolian, greatly pleasing the Emperor.\n\nOn the ninth day of the tenth month, under a clear night, the Emperor summoned the Master again to discuss the Dao, and he took great delight.\n\nOn the twenty-third day, the Master was again invited into the pavilion, with the same formalities as before.\nThe Emperor listened with warmth, ordering his attendants to record the words, and commanded them to be inscribed in Han characters—his intent clear that they should not be forgotten.\nTo his retinue, he said: *\"The Three Sovereigns have thrice spoken of the art of nurturing life, and their teachings have deeply moved me. See that these words are not leaked beyond these walls.\"*\n\nFrom that point onward, as they traveled east, the Master frequently expounded on Dao and transformation.\nAfter several more days, they reached thirty *lǐ* southwest of the great city of Yémǐsīgàn.",

I always take pleasure in quiet repose, whether sitting or standing. Before the imperial tent, the soldiers and horses are in constant motion, and my spirit is not at ease. From this point onward, some may go ahead, others may follow behind—let them proceed at their own discretion. The mountains have been greatly favored by your grace.\"*\n\nThe Emperor agreed.\n\nAfter the Master had left, the Emperor sent someone to ask him: *\"Do you wish to stay or depart?\"*\nThe Master replied: *\"No need.\"*\n\nAt that time, a light rain began to fall, green grass sprouted anew, and though mid-winter had passed, snow and rain grew more frequent, and the earth’s vital breath (*qì*) was just beginning to stir.\n\nWhen the Master arrived at this city, he distributed any remaining provisions to the starving people, and often set up soup kitchens, saving many lives.\n\nOn the twenty-sixth day, they departed.\n\nOn the twenty-third day of the twelfth month, the cold snow caused many oxen and horses along the road to freeze to death.\n\nThree days later, as they traveled east, they crossed the **Huo Tan** River (*a great river*), reaching the **Xíngzài** encampment. There, they heard that the ferry bridge had been broken in the middle of the night on the twenty-eighth day, scattering its supports.\n\nThe Emperor inquired about the thunderous lightning, and the Master answered: *\"In the mountains, I have heard that your people do not bathe in the river during summer, do not wash their clothes, nor make felt. If wild silkworms are found, their gathering is forbidden—all out of fear of the Heavenly might. This is not the Dao of reverence for Heaven! I have also heard that the greatest crime is filial disobedience, and Heaven warns through such signs. Now, I hear that many in your realm neglect their parents. You, O Emperor, ride upon virtue and power—you may admonish your people.\"*\n\nThe Emperor rejoiced, saying: *\"The Master’s words truly accord with my heart. Command my attendants to record these teachings in **Huixia** script.\"* (*Huixia* being the script of the Uighurs)\n\nThe Master begged to proclaim these lessons to all the people, but the Emperor refused.\n\nThe Emperor then gathered the Crown Prince, the Princes, and the great ministers, saying: *\"The Han people revere the Dao/Way of the Three Sovereigns just as you revere Heaven. I now believe even more—they are indeed Heavenly beings and humans combined.\"*\n\nHe then expounded the Master’s previous discourses and replies to them, adding: *\"Heaven has sent the Three Sovereigns to speak these words to me. Each of you should engrave them upon your hearts.\"* The Master bowed and withdrew. By the next New Year’s Day, the generals, physicians, and diviners (*wǔbǔ* officials) came to congratulate him.\n\nOn the eleventh day, the horses turned eastward, gazing back at **Yémǐsīgàn** some thousand *lǐ* away, and halted at a great orchard.\n\nOn the eighteenth day, the Master’s disciple Li Gong from the **Tàishīfǔ** (*Grand Master’s Office*) departed. The Master said: *\"Will we meet again?\"*\nLi Gong replied: *\"In the third month.\"*\nThe Master said: *\"You do not understand Heaven’s principles. By the second or third month, I shall have definitely returned east.\"*\n\nOn the twenty-first day, after traveling a short distance eastward, they reached a great river, three *lǐ* northeast of **Sàilán**, where the water and grass were abundant, enough to satiate the oxen and horses. They lingered there.\n\nOn the seventh day of the second month, the Master entered to pay his respects, reporting: *\"In the mountains, I have been distant from the Han lands for about three years, and now I return. This is my true wish—to return to the mountains after three years.\"*\n\nThe Emperor said: *\"I have already traveled east. Can we share the road?\"*\nThe Master replied: *\"I can proceed ahead as you wish.\"*\n\nWhen he left earlier, the Han people asked him about his return, and he had answered: *\"Three years.\"* Now, after the Emperor’s inquiries and discourses had concluded, he again firmly declined to stay.\n\nThe Emperor said: *\"Wait but three or five days. The Crown Prince will arrive, and you may address any unresolved matters of the Dao. Once I comprehend them, I will depart.\"*\n\nOn the eighth day, the Emperor hunted in the eastern foothills, shooting a great boar. His horse stumbled, and the boar stood beside him, daring not to advance. The attendants brought another horse, and the hunt was abandoned as they returned to the palace.\n\nThe Master, hearing of this, entered to remonstrate: *\"The Dao of Heaven favors life. Now that Your Majesty’s years are advanced, it is fitting to hunt less often. The horse’s fall was a Heavenly warning.

Many took refuge.\n\nWhen the master alighted from his carriage, rain fell again. The people rejoiced, saying: *\"In past summers, this place rarely saw rain. Even when thunderstorms came, they mostly struck between the southern and northern mountains. Today, the rain has reached our feet—all due to the blessings of our master’s Dao.\"*\n\nThe locals usually dredged the river to irrigate their fields, and by the eighth day, the wheat and barley would ripen. Yet they never matched the yield of Heaven’s rain. When autumn harvests came, field mice—many of them white—became a plague.\n\nThis land is often cold, and crops mature late. In May, the riverbanks had soil a *chi* deep, beneath which lay firm ice another *chi* thick. After the ritual, [the master] ordered someone to retrieve it.\n\nTo the south, towering ridges bore snow year-round, even in scorching summer, and many marvels were seen there.\n\nNear the western sea, beside a windy grave mound, the soil was white and chalky, cracked like powder. In the second or third month, winds would rise from the southern mountains, and the cliffs and caves would roar first—as if scouts heralding the storm. The wind emerged from the mound, first swirling like countless ram’s horns, then coalescing into a single tempest. It hurled sand and stones, tore roofs from houses, uprooted trees, and shook the hundred rivers before subsiding in the southeast.\n\nFurther east-southeast, behind a ravine, there were three or four water mills. But once the land leveled, the water dwindled and vanished, while the mountains yielded coal.\n\nTo the east, there were two springs.

**Xíngshěng Jīnzǐ Shílù Gōng** and **Liányì Liú Gōng** repeatedly submitted petitions,\nRequesting that the Master oversee **Dàtiān Cháng Guān**.\nOn the twenty-second of that month,\nHe accepted their plea, and as he departed northwestward,\nA number of cranes led the way from the sky.\n\nSince the Master’s stay at **Yùxū**,\nHe sometimes accepted invitations to private households for fasting rituals,\nAnd cranes—three or five at a time—would often fly and call above them.\nIn the north, few had followed the Dao before,\nBut now, through the display of sacred transformations,\nEven the wise and virtuous were turning toward it.\n\nThe eight assemblies all knelt and bowed,\nPerforming the rites of the Dao,\nAnd the customs of the age shifted entirely.\n\nThe well water at **Yùxū** had once been bitter and salty,\nBut in the years **Jiāshēn** and **Yǒuyǒu**,\nWhen Western Daoists arrived in great numbers,\nThe water’s taste changed to sweetness—a fortunate omen.\n\nOn the full moon of late summer,\nThe **Xuānchāi Xiànggōng** sent **Zhàbā** with an eight-part decree:\n*\"Since the Immortals departed,\nI have not once forgotten them,\nAnd the Immortals must not forget me.\nWherever I have lands or dwellings that I cherish,\nLet the disciples always recite scriptures and pray for my blessings.\"*\n\nSince the Master’s return,\nDaoist companions from all directions gathered,\nAnd false teachings faded.\nThe people of the capital flocked to him in devotion,\nAs if each household had received clear instruction—\nTheir doors opened wide, and the numbers swelled a hundredfold over before.\n\nEight assemblies were then established at **Tiān Cháng**:\n**Píngděng**, **Chángchūn**, **Língbǎo**, **Chángshēng**, **Míngzhēn**, **Píng’ān**, **Xiāozāi**, and **Wànlián**.\n\nAfter the Master returned to **Tiān Cháng**,\nMore distant Daoists came seeking his teachings and blessings.\nHe once revealed four verses to them:\n\nThe first:\n*\"Worldly passions know no end,\nThe **Dharma-realm** wears away.\nLikes and dislikes ensnare the heart,\nDragging one adrift—what can be done?\"*\n\nThe second:\n*\"There is a treasure before Heaven’s birth,\nNameless, yet not self-born.\nThe human heart lies hidden and suppressed,\nWhile the **Dharma-realm** roams free.\"*\n\nThe third:\n*\"Chasing things, the eyes grow dizzy,\nToiling in life’s four elements leads to exhaustion.\nThe world is all illusion,\nYet the mind remains unaware of emptiness.\"*\n\nThe fourth:\n*\"Yesterday, I held nothing in restraint,\nToday, my affairs are the same.\nBetter to let go entirely,\nAnd pass the day in boundless void.\"*\n\nAfter each fasting ritual,\nHe would wander to the old imperial gardens of **Qiónghuá**,\nAccompanied by six or seven followers.\nThey would recline beneath the pines,\nSometimes composing poems in turn,\nOr, after tea, ordering his attendants to sing a few verses of *Youxiān* songs.\nAs the sun dipped behind the mountains,\nThey would drift into a tranquil forgetfulness.\n\nThus,\nThe **Xíngshěng** and **Xuānchāi Zhàbā Xiànggōng** presented the northern gardens, ponds, and nearby lands—\nSpanning tens of hectares—\nAnd requested that they be made into a Daoist academy.\nThe Master declined at first,\nBut after repeated requests, he accepted.\n\nLater, he issued an edict to prohibit firewood gathering,\nAnd settled the Daoist companions there,\nOverseeing repairs and improvements.\nHe then submitted a formal report, which the Emperor approved.\n\nFrom that time onward,\nOn fine days and festive occasions,\nThe Master never failed to visit them.\n\nOn **Tomb-Sweeping Day**, he composed two poems:\nThe first:\n*\"A ten-acre pond lies quiet in the imperial garden,\nTall pines and cypresses shroud it in mist.\nPavilions and halls—all now dreams of the past,\nWhile peach blossoms and willows belong to the Immortals in spring.\nBeyond the isle, no purer place exists,\nIn the mortal world, only **Guǎnghán Tiān** compares.\nI know the Creator’s design is fixed—\nWhy beg for fields to sow misfortune for officials and commoners?\"*\n\nThe second:\n*\"At **Qīngmíng**, the apricot blossoms bloom,\nTen thousand doors and gates open and close each day.\nBeyond the isle, the spring waters stretch vast and hazy,\nWhile warm winds rustle through the pines.\nTravelers sigh as the setting sun presses near,\nYet the enlightened linger, delaying the fleeting light.\nHow could I obtain the **Great Elixir** to transmute my bones?\nAnd ascend, embodied, to the **Yùluó Terrace**?\"*",

      "translated_text": "The *jiǎyǒu* year, the Fourth Month—Lord Marshal Wang Jiuchuan of the Right Wing invited the Master to observe a fast at his residence. The Master, a native of the Right Wing, then spoke of the luxuriant bamboo and trees of Xianyang and Zhongnan Mountains, requesting the Master to inspect the courtyard bamboo.\n\nThe Master said: *\"This bamboo is exceptionally fine. After the ravages of war and fire, such specimens are rare indeed. In my time at Pánxī, the dense forests and towering bamboo were a marvel beyond compare—now, I recall them as in a dream. Now old and my return approaching, I would take but a score of these stalks to plant in the northern veranda of Bǎoyuán, merely to shield my gaze.\"*\n\nLord Marshal Wang said: *\"The realm still suffers from strife, its people hanging by a thread. The Sovereign now honors the Way and reveres the Master’s true teachings, relying on your virtue to safeguard all life. Why speak thus of departure?\"*\nHe begged the Master to extend his compassion and prioritize saving the world.\n\nThe Master struck the ground with his staff, smiling as he replied: *\"Heaven’s decree is fixed—what power lies in mortals?\"*\nNone could fathom his meaning.\n\nBy the end of the Fifth Month, the Master ascended the peak of Shòulè Mountain. Gazing about, the gardens sprawled like emerald canopies, and travelers resting beneath them felt no trace of the scorching heat. There, he composed a *wǔyán* poem:\n\n---\n*Earth meets the frontier’s edge,*\n*Its walls press ancient and modern.*\n*Though palaces lie in ruin,*\n*Fine gardens yet remain.*\n*Green trees cluster thick,*\n*Cool winds blow deep.*\n*As if on an Isle of Immortals,*\n*I survey the eight quarters, chanting.*\n---\n\nLater, upon the Master’s return from Qióngdǎo, Lord Chen Xiùyù came to pay his respects. The Master presented him with a *qīyán lǜ* poem:\n\n---\n*Crags rise steep and lone against Heaven,*\n*Cypress shadows darkly clasp the halls.*\n*Amyriads of mist and haze abide,*\n*While rivers of wind and moon flow idle.*\n*Pines soar from deep ravines,*\n*Strange stones jut from the lake’s embrace.*\n*All are the leisurely arts of longevity—*\n*Refining virtue, offering blessings beyond the capital.*\n\n---\n\nOn the auspicious ninth day of the Ninth Month, Lord Marshal Wang, seeing the *Yínghuǒ* star encroach upon the *Wěi* constellation—an omen of misfortune for the Yan lands—planned to request the Master perform an exorcism (*jiào*). He asked how much it would cost.\n\nThe Master replied: *\"Even a single displaced thing stirs my pity—how much more an entire realm? For years, the people have suffered from levies and exhaustion, both public and private. I shall provide the necessities from the Observing Hall’s endowment, but let the court officials fast and purify themselves in preparation. Beyond that, I require nothing.\"*\n\nThus, the exorcism was set for two days and nights. Though aged, the Master personally prayed at the Mysterious Altar. When the rites concluded that evening, Lord Marshal Wang rejoiced, saying: *\"The *Yínghuǒ* star has already retreated several degrees—we need fear no more!\"*\nHow swift was the Master’s virtue in moving others!\n\nThe Master said: *\"What virtue do I possess? Petitions to Heaven have existed since antiquity—only insincerity fails.\"* As the ancients said: *\"Sincerity moves Heaven.\"* Such is the way.\n\nOn the Ninth of the Ninth, Daoist disciples from afar gathered, some bearing chrysanthemums as offerings. The Master composed a *cí* with a lament for delayed joy:\n\n---\n*A spirit-strain of singular nature,*\n*Waiting for autumn winds to chill its roots.*\n*Scattering blooms by the hundred billions,*\n*Golden petals gleam—*\n*Illuminating the void of Heaven and Earth.*\n*On the Ninth, they fill the hall’s corners,*\n*And all within see clearly,*\n*As if gazing on eternal life,*\n*Unwithering—*\n*Fitting companions for idle repose.*\n\n---\n\nSoon after, a disciple of the Way arrived with silk scrolls, seeking the Master’s autograph. He inscribed them with the words of *\"Fèngqī Dēngwú\"*:\n\n---\n*To gain true rest is rest itself—*\n*Winning leisure, free from toil.*\n*How many bright and resolute souls*\n*Have busied themselves in vain!*\n*Heaven’s shifts know no end,*\n*Yesterday’s song, today’s sorrow.*\n*Who knows tomorrow’s affairs?*\n*Why weary the mind over trifles?*\n\n---\n\nOn another day, someone questioned the Master on a matter. He responded with detached indifference, resolving it with Daoist principle, then recited a verse for him:\n\n---\n*Brush, brush, brush—*\n*Brush away all thoughts until none remain.*\n*When the mind holds nothing,*\n*That is the true person.*\n*The true person is already an Immortal, a Buddha.*\n\nThe man, hearing this, bowed in awe and withdrew.\n\nIn the *bǐngxū* year’s First Month, officials from Pánshān invited the Master to perform a *Huángè* exorcism for three days and nights. That day, the sky cleared, hearts lightened, and spring stirred in the cold valleys. On the eve of the rites, he showed the assembly this poem:\n\n---\n*Twisted peaks plunge deep,*\n*Mountains lift the weary soul.*\n*Ridges vie in towering height,*\n*Great ravines stretch vast and grim.*\n*Seems some flying Immortal passes,*\n*Yet no birds nest here.*\n*Three days of yellow-crowned rites,*\n*Ten thousand households in white attend.*\n\n---\n\nIn the Fifth Month, the capital suffered a severe drought, and farmers could not sow. All feared for the harvest. Officials relocated the market and erected an altar for supplication, but for weeks, there was no response. The Provincial Governor sent envoys with a petition, requesting the Master perform a rain-pleading exorcism for three days and two nights.\n\nOn the night the rites were to begin, clouds gathered from all sides, and soon rain fell. From midnight until mealtime, it did not cease. The Provincial Governor’s envoys arrived with incense, thanking the Master: *\"The capital has long endured drought, the countryside parched, crops unplanted, and the people near despair. Thanks to your virtue and communion with the Highest Truth, sweet dew has descended. The common folk say: ‘This is the rain of the Immortals.’\"*\n\nThe Master replied: *\"The Governor’s sincerity has moved the Highest Truth, who in turn has shown mercy to save all life. What part did I play?\"*\nThe envoys departed, then returned with another message: *\"The rain has fallen, yet the drought remains unrelieved! If only a torrential downpour could come—this drought would end. We beg the Master’s compassion.\"*\n\nThe Master said: *\"Fear not. When mortals move Heaven with sincerity, Heaven answers in kind. The great rain will surely come.\"*\n\nBefore the fast concluded, the storm broke with overwhelming force. That year, the harvest came, and eminent scholars and officials sent poems in celebration.\n\nLater, a certain Wu Dàqīng Déming presented four *jùjué* verses. The Master responded in rhyme.",

returns to Penglai’s isle,\nA million kalpas’ incense rises from the earthen mound.\n\n**Second:**\nI dwell alone in the deep mountain’s embrace,\nWho could know the world’s praise in its place?\nThe Yellow Emperor’s Daoist came to call,\nYet he spoke not of worldly books or talk.\n\n**Third:**\nDo not dismiss the idle as trifling,\nFor idle men, desireless, join the Celestial ranks.\nIf not here the mind’s ground is opened wide,\nWhen shall you climb the Treasure Peak’s heights?\n\n**Fourth:**\nFrom Chaos’ origin, Nature’s Way unfolds,\nThe luminous spirit spans great and small.\nBorn and dying, ever without self,\nStriding past and present, the Daoist’s ease.\n\nOn the painting of *San Xian* (One, Preserver, and Substance):\nThe perfected True Ones know no end to their Way,\nThree Masters of old—where do their traces display?\nDirectly teaching the Celestial Treasury’s heir,\nTheir deeds in mortal realms rival *Chi Song*’s fame.\n\nTo a supplicant of the Dao, in seven-character verse:\nDawn and dusk rush past in fleeting haste,\nDarkness swaps my life—my temples now threadbare.\nThe Creator’s jest with mortals is but a dream,\nWhat then of yesterday’s strife—what purpose now?\n\nSince receiving the provincial officials’ petition,\nThe Master pitied the Heavenly Long’s sacred halls and shrines,\nTheir dwellings crumbling—windows, steps, and walls in ruin.\nHe ordered his disciples: *“Let them repair what is broken,\nPatch the leaks, straighten what leans.\nSevered hands shall be restored anew.”*\nHe also built forty-plus lodgings,\nNo external aid—all from the monastery’s own means.\n\nEach summer, he ordered the halls to forgo lamps,\nOnly in late autumn did he permit their use,\nA precaution against fire.\n\nIn the tenth month, he resided in *Fanghu*,\nEach evening summoning the assembled *Shide* in order,\nEngaging in lofty discourse, sometimes till dawn.\n\nOn the thirteenth day of *zhōngdōng* (mid-winter),\nHe rose at midnight, pacing the courtyard.\nReturning to his seat, he composed a five-character *lü* poem for the assembly:\n\n*The cosmos vast beneath the boundless sky,\nThree watches spent in toil upon the earth.\nShen’s asterism sinks behind the western peak,\nThe North Star turns—its axis high.*\n*The great momentum cannot be restrained,\nThe boundless heavens hold no veil.*\n*Who governs this eternal cycle’s reign?\nA billion kalpas—unyielding, firm.*\n\nIn *dīnghài* (1387), drought persisted from spring to summer.\nThe officials prayed repeatedly, yet received no relief.\nThe Daoist assembly of the capital,\nOn one day, visited the Master for a rain-appeasing ritual.\nLater, they also requested a disaster-dispelling assembly.\n\nThe Master said: *“I have devoted myself to these rites,\nAnd now you propose the same—\nGood intentions meet without prior agreement.\nYou two groups should only redouble your efforts.”*\nHe set the first day of the fifth month for the rain-appeasing ritual,\nAnd the third day for the thanksgiving ritual.\nIf rain fell by the third day, it would count.\nEven if it rained after, it would not be the ritual’s doing.\n\nSome said: *“Heaven’s will is hard to fathom.\nIf the Master speaks thus, and the deadline passes,\nWill he not invite slander from petty men?”*\n\nThe Master replied: *“This is beyond your understanding.”*\nWhen the ritual was held, rain fell that very day.\nThe next day, it rained a foot deep,\nAnd by the third day, the skies cleared entirely.\nThe thanksgiving ritual concluded as he had foretold.\n\nAt the time, the heat was oppressive.\nGeneral Zhang Zīyǔn invited the Master to West Mountain,\nWhere he visited the temple repeatedly.\nThe day after the fast ended, rain-soaked,\nHe toured the East Mountain Hermitage.\nSeated with guests in the forest at dusk,\nAs evening fell, he composed an absolute verse for the assembly:\n\n*West Mountain’s breeze is crisp and clear,\nPost-rain clouds drift light as air.\nA guest sits deep in the woods,\nWithout thought, the Dao takes root.*\n\nReturning to General Zhang’s estate,\nHe stayed in the tower for several days,\nListening to Daoist teachings till dawn.\n\nHe also responded to invitations from Dàgǔ Hermitage,\nThen to Qīngmèng Hermitage the next day.\n\nThat night, a great rain swept in from the north,\nThunder and lightning clashing violently.\nThe Master said: *“This is the Dao’s power.\nThose who attain the Way wield radiant might—\nThunder and lightning cannot compare.\nNight deepened, guests dispersed,\nThe Master reclined in the grass hall.\nSoon, a terrifying wind and rain struck,\nA single thunderclap nearly shattered the windows,\nThen silence fell—all marveled.*\n\nSome asked: *“If thunder were to strike, why cease so swiftly?”*\nA respondent said: *“Could it be the presence of a Sage\nHas caused the Thunderer to temper his wrath?”*\n\nLater, on the twenty-fifth of the fifth month,\nDaoist Wang Zhìmíng arrived from Qinzhou,\nBearing edicts to rename *Beigōng Xiāndǎo* as *Wàn’ān Gōng*,\nAnd *Chángchūn Guàn* as *Chángchūn Gōng*.\nThe decree ordered all householders of virtue\nTo be enrolled under them,\nAnd granted them the *Jīnhǔ Pái* (Golden Tiger Seal),\nThus all Daoist affairs were placed under the Celestial Masters’ jurisdiction.\n\nAfter the *xiǎoshǔ* (minor heat) node,\nHeavy rains fell repeatedly, easing the scorching heat.\nHe composed a seven-character poem for the assembly:\n\n*Stifling summer chokes the land for ten thousand leagues,\nTidal waves crash against the seas and rivers’ rage.*\n*The autumn harvest’s fine grains now swell in sight,\nThe drought-demon’s curse dissolves by the fifth month’s light.*\n*The people rejoice—life’s hope restored anew,\nThe armies march without command’s decree.*\n*Truly, the Dao’s influence knows no bounds,\nDarkly bestowing abundance on the Holy Court.*\n\nSince the *Qióngdǎo* became a Daoist academy,\nWoodcutters and fishermen vanished for years,\nWhile birds and fish thrived in the gardens and pools,\nAnd visitors came and went without cease.\n\nAfter the fast, the Master rode his horse on ordinary days.\nOn the twenty-first of the sixth month,\nHe fell ill and did not venture out,\nInstead descending to the eastern stream of the palace.\n\nOn the twenty-third,\nNews arrived at noon—\nA great thunderclap split the southern bank of *Tàiyè Pool*,\nFlooding into the East Lake, its roar heard for tens of miles.\nTurtles, crocodiles, fish, and crabs all fled,\nThe pool dried up entirely,\nAnd the *Běikǒu

      "translated_text": "The Master heard this, at first saying nothing. After a long while, he laughed and said: *\"When the mountain collapses and the pool dries, shall I go with it?\"*\n\nOn the fourth of the seventh month, the Master told his disciples: *\"In the past, Dānyáng once gave me a prophecy, saying: After my death, the Daoist teaching shall flourish greatly, and the four quarters shall often be transformed into Daoist lands. You, Gongzhèng, are now in that time. The Daoist academies have all been granted imperial names and quotas. You shall also reside in the grand temples and observatories, with envoys bearing seals and official dispatches to oversee the teaching. This is the moment when your merit is complete, your name established, and you may retire in peace. Every word of Dānyáng’s prophecy has come true, as if sealed by fate itself. Moreover, within the teaching, all matters of administration—both internal and external—are now fully settled. I depart without any regrets.\"*\n\nWhen the Master revealed his illness in Bǎoyuán, on that day, his breath came in shallow gasps. His disciples tried to stop him, but he said: *\"I do not wish to trouble others. You still have your duties to attend to. What difference does it make if I rest in the coffin?\"*\n\nOn the seventh of the seventh month, his disciples again pleaded: *\"Each day, the assembly of devotees is vast. We beg you to extend your great compassion and return to the hall, that we may pay our respects.\"*\n\nThe Master replied: *\"I shall ascend the hall on the ninth day.\"*\n\nThat day, in the afternoon, he composed this farewell verse:\n\n*\"Life and death, dawn and dusk—all one affair,*\n*Like bubbles rising and vanishing in endless water.*\n*Where faint light shines, the hare and crow leap,*\n*When measure is set, mountains and seas are contained.*\n*With a wave, the eight extremes shrink to inches,*\n*With a breath, ten thousand things move like mechanisms.*\n*Mad words spill like dust beneath the brush,*\n*Left for the foolish ears of this fleeting age.\"*\n\nThen, he ascended the Bǎoguāng Hall and departed in truth, filling the room with strange fragrance. His disciples lit incense and bowed in farewell. As they wept, attendants Zhāng Zhìsù and Wǔ Zhìjù hurried to stop them, saying: *\"The True Person has left behind instructions: Let Sòng Dào’ān oversee the teaching, Yǐn Zhìpíng assist him, Zhāng Zhìsōng next, and Wáng Zhìmíng continue his former duties. Sòng Défāng and Lǐ Zhìcháng shall also deliberate on teaching matters.\"* They then recited the farewell poem again, and Sòng Dào’ān and the others bowed twice in acceptance.\n\nAt dawn, they donned mourning robes and performed funeral rites. Tens of thousands rushed to attend the funeral.\n\nWhen the imperial envoy Liú Zhònglù heard of this, he was stunned and sighed: *\"Since the True Person’s audience with the sovereign, the bond between ruler and subject was harmonious. After his departure from the capital, the emperor’s affection never waned.

      "translated_text": "Thus, those seeking instruction in the Dao’s name grew ever more numerous.\n\nOne day, the overseer Sònggōng said to Zhìcháng: *\"This month’s seventh day marks when you and I together received the Master’s final teachings. Matters of the Dao’s name and such—you shall draft the documents in my handwriting and seal them with my mark. This practice shall continue as before.\"*\n\nSoon after, the Pure Harmony Master Yǐngōng arrived from Déxīng to conduct the rites. When the seven days of mourning concluded, the overseer Sònggōng said to Pure Harmony: *\"I am old and cannot uphold the Dao’s affairs. You may now take my place and lead them.\"* After declining twice, Pure Harmony accepted the charge, and near and far, those who followed the Way gathered, their numbers no fewer than before.\n\nOn the first day of the third month of the *Wùzǐ* year, Pure Harmony proposed building a hall for the Master at Báiyún Guàn. Some objected: *\"The labor is immense, and provisions scarce—this may not succeed.\"* Pure Harmony replied: *\"All things must be considered beforehand. Though one may share in success, one cannot share in planning from the start. If the matter serves no private gain and the Dao’s community exerts its full strength, what cannot be accomplished? Moreover, the Master’s enduring virtue remains with the people—who among the four quarters would not revere him? No need for further persuasion; there will be those who spontaneously aid this cause. If not, let the common funds be exhausted, and each take only a single ladleful—this would be my wish.\"*\n\nThe imperial envoy Liúgōng, hearing this, rejoiced and lent his full support. He then commissioned Jūzhì Yuányuán and others to oversee the work. From the fourth month’s *Dīng* day, they cleared the site and laid the foundation, spanning the *Wù*, *Jǐ*, and *Gēng* months. Soon, Daoists from Píngyáng, Tàiyuán, Jiān, Dài, Yù, and Yìng—over two hundred in total—brought provisions and labor, willingly constructing the hall. In forty days, the work was complete, though the names of all who contributed cannot be fully recorded. Some remarked that though human effort achieved the structure, the sages’ unseen influence must have sustained it.\n\nThe grand burial was set for the ninth day of the seventh month. Throughout June, incessant rain fell, raising fears it would disrupt the rites. On the seventh day’s first auspicious moment, word came of clear skies, and all hearts rejoiced in harmony. The day before, at the rites’ outset, incense was lit and offerings set forth to solemnize the ceremony. When the coffin was opened, the Master’s form remained intact, as if alive. Officials and commoners, monks and nuns, and all who gathered—over ten thousand across three days—pressed their hands to their brows in awe of his divine presence. News spread far and wide, drawing countless devotees to pay their respects, beyond number.\n\nThe temple then established a three-day *Fèng’ān* Daoist ritual, announcing a ten-day fast in advance. On the ninth day, at the *Chén* hour, a [Playen] *Xuànhè* crane arrived from the southwest, followed by a white crane, startling all who beheld them. After the *Zǐ* hour, a *Língbǎo Qīngjiào* exorcism was performed for the 360 degrees of the cosmos. When the rites concluded, the Master’s immortal remains were enshrined in the hall, filling the air with an unearthly fragrance that lingered for hours. At noon, the *zhāi* (vegetarian repast) was offered, with thousands in yellow robes and ceremonial attire, and ten thousand more adherents in attendance. After the rites, on the following day, heavy rain fell anew. All marveled: *\"Heaven and earth, above and below, in perfect accord—this great affair could not have been accomplished were it not for the Master’s virtue, complete and transcendent, harmonizing with the cosmos and the divine. Who else could achieve such wonders? Truly, this surpasses mere human power.\"*\n\nThe provisional chancellor and pacification commissioner, Wánggōng Jùchuān of Hányáng, a scion of the great clans, had long admired the [Playen] *Xuànhè* tradition. In recent years, he had also met with the Master’s father in Yān, sharing kindred spirit and aligned Dao. His reverence now exceeded even his past devotion. Thus, for this burial, he took the lead.
