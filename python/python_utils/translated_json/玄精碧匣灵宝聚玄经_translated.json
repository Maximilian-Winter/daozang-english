[text corrupt]\nthe Five Qi intermingling,\nhumankind begins here.\n\n- **Minor Cold** (lower)\n- **Minor Heat** (lower)\n- **Beginning of Spring** (middle)\n- **Beginning of Autumn** (middle)\n- **Grain Rain** (upper)\n- **Frost’s Descent** (upper)\n- **Grain in Ear** (upper)\n- **Minor Snow** (upper)\n\nThe Canon states: The central image is void,\nreferring to the position of *wu* and *ji*.\nEarth is lodged in *Kun*,\nborne by the Mother.\nThe myriad things obtain it to live,\ngoverned by it to grow.\nWhen mountains and rivers take shape,\nthe Hundred Spirits first emerge.\nThe numbers of Heaven and Earth—\nfive times five makes twenty-five,\ncompleting the Great Dao\nand activating the spirits.\nThe Six Qi are vigorous and bright,\nfirm and yielding each in its place.\nThe myriad things all flourish,\nYin and Yang greatly prosper.\nThe hundred vessels first open,\n*Qian* and *Kun* radiate splendor.\n\n- **Major Cold** (lower)\n- **Major Heat** (lower)\n- **Spring Equinox** (lower)\n- **Autumn Equinox** (lower)\n- **Rain Water** (middle)\n- **End of Heat** (middle)\n- **Grain in Beard** (upper)\n- **Major Snow** (upper)\n\nThe *Qian* hexagram generates *Hai*,\nwhere Yin qi reaches its extreme.\nThus, in the Dao of transformation,\nwhen the decisive moment comes, Yin must retreat,\nand pure Yang begins to arise—\nthis is the meaning of the small departing and the great arriving.\nMetal and Water interflow,\ndirectly generating through greatness.\nThus, *Qian* in stillness is focused,\nin movement is single-minded.\nThe firmness of Heaven inclines above,\nand the sun and moon return to it.\nWhen divining human fortune or misfortune,\nthe signs are half in hesitation, cycling endlessly—\nproceeding thus, there must be breaks and omissions.\nMetal qi lacks support,\nand the force of withering arrives.\nUnwittingly, a chill descends,\nand the hexagram emerges from *Dui*.\n\nNone escape the seventh,\nas Heaven and Earth startle in smoke.\n\n- **Winter Solstice** (middle)\n- **Summer Solstice** (middle)\n- **Awakening of Insects** (middle)\n- **White Dew** (middle)\n- **Pure Brightness** (middle)\n- **Cold Dew** (lower)\n- **Beginning of Summer** (lower)\n- **Beginning of Winter** (lower)\n\nThe *Dui* hexagram generates *You*,\nwhere the gate of the moon is tied.\nThe setting sun wanes and declines,\nand the myriad things age and die.\nIt enforces the withering command,\nhence called the place where Heaven and Earth reward good and punish evil.\n*Dui* means joy.\nWhen divining, one may encounter disputes or lawsuits,\nunable to clarify reason—\nthe schemes of the secretive will be exposed.\nIt is also the gate of the sun and moon,\nso all matters will be obstructed in the end.\n\n*Gen* halts at eight,\nwhere the myriad things harbor destruction.\nFire emerges in *Yin*,\nforging the seven metals.\nLooking down, one sees the pit of *Kan*;\ngazing up, the brightness of *Li*.\n\n- **Minor Cold** (middle)\n- **Minor Heat** (middle)\n- **Beginning of Spring** (upper)\n- **Beginning of Autumn** (upper)\n- **Grain Rain** (lower)\n- **Frost’s Descent** (lower)\n- **Lesser Fullness** (lower)\n- **Minor Snow** (lower)\n\nThe *Gen* hexagram arises in *Yin*,\nwhere advance and retreat know no constancy.\nWhen it is time to halt, halt;\nwhen it is time to move, move.\nIn motion and stillness, one does not miss the proper moment—\n*Gen* means halting where one ought to halt.\nWhen divining, one’s advance or retreat\nwill not depart from one’s dwelling.\nIn the month of *Jianyin*,\nthe yang qi greatly extends.\nOne may advance but must not retreat—\nthis is the time to press forward.\nFire blazes above,\nwater moistens below.\nWithin their interplay,\nday and night are divided.\nAt night, the yang ascends ninefold,\ninverting and transforming all.\n\n- **Major Cold** (middle)\n- **Major Heat** (middle)\n- **Spring Waters** (middle)\n- **Autumn Equinox** (upper)\n- **Rain Water** (middle)\n- **End of Heat** (lower)\n- **Grain in Ear** (lower)\n- **Major Snow** (lower)\n\nThe *Li* hexagram arises in *Wu*,\nwhere yin qi is born.\nThe yang qi divides its position,\nand the two encroach upon each other.\nThe firm resides without,\nyet can remain settled;\nthe yielding lies within,\nyet cannot fix its place.\nThe great departs, the small arrives—\nbrightness yet [lacuna].\nWhen [lacuna] is exhausted,\naffairs will perish.\nWhen divining, one may encounter unrighteous principles.\nAligning qi and transcending spirit,\none relies on the eight trigrams of the palace.\nSplitting and uniting, waxing and waning,\nrising and falling alternate.\nNorth and south traverse,\nforming winter and summer;\neast and west emerge and submerge,\ndividing day and night.\nThe sun and moon cycle endlessly,\nnever failing to meet in due course.\n\nHeaven is *Qian*, father of the myriad sounds;\nEarth is *Kun*, mother of the myriad things.\nWhen yin qi has waned,\n*Xun* becomes the eldest daughter.\nIt weaves through the nine voids,\nencompassing the eight lands,\naligning the seven luminaries,\nand returning to the Purple Tenuity.\nIt binds the warp of Heaven and Earth,\nthe stars and sun follow the turning jade.\nThe pivot is fixed in *Kan*,\nthe Dipper’s handle points high.\nThe ten thousand forms array in order—\nHeaven’s rigidity directs the lunar generals.\nDay and night divide swift and slow.\nThe yellow, red, and black paths\nfollow the shortness of the *Kui*.\nThe ten thousand forms hang in display,\nencircling and guarding the imperial enclosure.\nThe four poles establish the great luminaries,\nthe four seasons are woven by their warp and weft.\n\nThe Eastern Palace of the Great Sun Sovereign,\nJupiter in the Celestial Palace of *Tianpeng*.\nThe Azure Spring governs the south;\nMars, the Earth-Water Palace, *Luoshu* and *Tianyou*.\nThe Vermilion Summer governs the west,\noverseeing the middle realm—\nthe Moon, Venus, Saturn, Venus again,\n*Ketu*, *Moon Comet*, and *Black Killer*.\nThe White Autumn governs the north;\nMercury, the Dark Warrior of the deep.\nThe Black Winter governs—\nthe twenty-eight lodgings:\n*Jiao, Kang, Di, Fang, Xin, Wei, Ji, Dou, Niu, Nü, Xu, Wei, Shi, Bi, Kui, Lou, Wei, Mao, Bi, Zi, Shen, Jing, Gui, Liu, Xing, Zhang, Yi, Zhen*.\nBeyond their circuit lie the thirty-six secondary luminaries.\n\nThe August Supreme Purity,\nthe primal script of the empty ultimate.\nFrom the radiant brush’s movement,\nthe plain and unchanging unfolds.\nThe chariot ascends the cliff,\nresolving filial reverence and profound reflection.\n\nThe Celestial Cloud’s Azure Pearl,\nthe radiant blossoms gleam in emptiness.\nThe Hall of Auspicious Longevity,\nsoaring illumination descends upon the sun.\nIn due season, all stars harmonize and assist,\nthe Five Phases and four cardinal directions.\nThey govern the qi and the fortunes of the age,\nthe rise and fall of humanity.\nRegulating yin and yang,\neternal order may thus be anticipated.\n\n**Thunder, Wind, and Rain Division**\nThe Great Unity’s thunder,\nlinked to the Eight Trigrams.\nHeavenly Impulse shatters the armies;\nthe Thunder Ancestor, the Great Emperor.\nWhen the movement enters the Qian Palace,\nit is called the Opening of Heaven.\nWhen it enters the Kun Palace,\nit is called the Closing of Earth.\nWhen it enters the Xun Palace,\nit is named the Master of Wind.\nWhen it enters the Kan Palace,\nit is named the Master of Rain.\nWhen it enters the Gen Palace,\nit is named Mount Fan.\nWhen it enters the Dui Palace,\nit is named Overturned Waters.\nWhen it enters the Zhen Palace,\nit is named □□.\nWhen it enters the Li Palace,\nit is named the Convergence of Lightning.\n\nThere is also the Wounding Gate,\nthe Thunder Deity in direct service.\nIn Qian, the thunderbolt;\nin □, □□.\nOn high, lightning flashes;\nin Kan, rain arises.\nIn Dui, it severs things;\nin Zhen, it strikes men.\nIn Kun and Gen,\n□□□□.\n\nFurther, when in exaltation or prosperity,\nthe yang agent soars high.\nWhen in decline or imprisonment,\nthe yin agent’s power wanes, low and faint.\nAfter the turning of the seasons,\nwhen □□□,\nyin and yang alternate between brightness and obscurity,\nprefiguring the celestial mechanism.\n\nEarthly qi ascends,\nclouds form in the void like celestial script.\nThe numbers of generation and completion\nprecede the *Hetu*.\nGui divides into ten exhaustions;\nyin begins with thirteen origins.\nZi, Chou, Si, Wu,\nJia Shen adds Ji Wei—\nthe azure and yellow qi\nreside in maternal nurturance,\nreleased and dispersed in Qian.\nYi and Ding emerge from Zhen;\nRen Wu aligns at the shoulder.\nBing and Xin govern Xu and Hai,\nthe source of Dui’s marshes.\nMao and You are the gates of sun and moon;\nGen is the pivot of the door.\nGeng Chen roams the upper trigram;\nWing’s fire star blazes,\nits path traversing the Black Road,\nluminous and perfectly round.\n\nFurther, when celestial qi descends,\nthe primordial constellation of the Southern Asterism\npresides over the Bureau of Wind and Rain.\nNext, its two envoys:\nthe Wind Master moves in reverse through the branches,\nthe Rain Master proceeds in order through the seasons,\nboth subordinate to the element of Water.\nWhen wind arises in the moon,\nfire scatters metal;\nwood halts the sun;\nearth subtly restrains wood.\nMetal’s void mists metal and water;\nwhen clouds lower, water and fire rage greatly,\nthe moon’s waters drip and flow.\n\nThe Great Yin’s solitary luminary\ntraverses the Black Road.\nHeaven enacts its full mechanism,\nthe balance entering the Thunder Bureau.\nBefore the assembly of all spirits,\nthere is either rain or darkness.\nWhen the Moon Bird’s spirit converges,\nthe balance enters Wei,\ndescending only into obscurity and confusion.\nIf encountering celestial stars,\nthe wind, water, and fire deities return to the four cardinal directions—\nfierce winds snap trees,\nmountains and peaks crumble and shatter.\n\nWhen hoping for clear skies,\nyin descends and yang ceases;\nyang descends and yin vanishes.\nOnly through the Southern Asterism’s palace of control\ndoes radiant clarity appear at once.\nIf the phases generate one another,\nor if like kinds approach their mothers,\nclouds gather and thicken,\ndarkening the empty sky.\n\nFurther to be avoided:\nwhen Venus and Mars appear together,\nor when azure and vermilion share the same position,\nthe moon traverses the Black Road—\nthen wind and thunder reverse and arise.\nWhen the Great Yin aligns with You,\nthe wind rages unabated;\nwhen rain arrives,\nthe Great Yin aligns with Mao—\nrain gives birth to violent thunder,\nrolling thunder shakes the rain.\nWhen the Great Yin traverses the Mansion of Net,\ndust flies and soil scatters.\nWhen the Moon’s course reaches the Mansion of Winnowing Basket,\nand the Great Yin departs from the Mansion of Net,\nwind stirs the Celestial Minister.\nIf it leaves the Mansion of Winnowing Basket,\nrain emerges from the celestial mechanism—\nwind is the flourishing qi of yin and yang.\n\nThe Celestial Storehouse and Celestial Sameness\nare the places where wind perishes.\nThe Celestial Beam and Celestial Pivot\nare the vast domains of wind.\nThe Celestial Minister and Celestial Mechanism\nare the officers who govern wind and rain.\nThe sun and moon’s movements\nalso pass through Qian and Kan.\nDivided between two paths,\nonly the Black Road governs wind.\nEmerging from the Nine Earths,\nit appears and vanishes without trace.\n\nThe profound mystery of the Essential Mystery\ndivides between summer and winter.\nThe Thunder Bureau\nhas major and minor divisions.\nThe major division is the Bureau;\nthe minor division is the Palace.\nEntering the Bureau governs rain;\nentering the Palace governs wind.\nThe celestial mechanism resides in the sun,\n□□□□.\nSeeking the root and tracing the source,\ntransformation and evasion interpenetrate.\nThree returns of day and night,\nwater and fire attack one another.\nThree essentials of movement and stillness,\n□□□□.\nDirect service and hidden resonance\ndiscuss the sun’s true lineage.\nThe two preceding and following celestial bodies\nfirst descend within it.\nThe natural Dao\ndoes not □□□.\nOnce yin and yang are divided,\nthe reckoning of wind and rain concludes.\n\n**Nine August Sovereigns and Direct Talismans Division**\nIn the first configuration of the Yang Evasion,\non Bing or Xin days during the Wu Zi hour,\ntake Jia Shen’s Heavenly Impulse as the Direct Talisman,\nadding it to Yi Palace’s six Wu’s Heavenly Penetrator hour.\nMajestic are the Nine August Ones,\nthe Direct Talismans of the Nine Palaces.\nThey govern the primal qi,\ntransforming without end.\n\nEach nature has its constancy, and all affairs submit to it.\nHeavenly Penetrator’s Zi Qin\nensures enduring stability.\nWater

victory—\nthe star of the Sun and Heavenly Task.\nMarriages birth noble sons,\ncommerce brings wealth.\n□□□□ ensures peace and tranquility.\n\nZi Fang’s direct hour—\nlong journeys bring joy.\nSummoning harmony achieves success,\nthe star of the Sun and Heavenly Hero.\nDeploying troops or waging battle,\nsoldiers suffer losses.\nDo not speak of relocation—\nfirelight arises.\nBuilding camps or constructing halls,\nwaists and eyes groan in pain.\nWhen the weak follow the strong,\ndisaster strikes deeply.\nHeaven’s numbers govern this—\nall must revere and honor.\n\n**Eight Trigrams’ Direct Affairs Division**\nThe eight gates’ direct affairs\ndivide by reversal and sequence.\nQian’s virtue opens,\nits governance belongs to Metal.\nFor undertakings and games of chance,\ngreat fortune in distant expeditions.\n\nKan Palace’s Resting Water—\nall affairs must be clear.\nConstruction favors advancement,\nseeking harmony and deploying troops.\nPrivate schemes fulfill

the month determines the stake.\nFrom the first, proceed to whichever direction.\nObserve the tortoise and purify the talismans—*Kan* Palace is auspicious.\nSitting at the Wounding Gate, one’s position will not last long.\nWhen stars enter the inner heavens, it is especially inauspicious.\n*Peng* and *ying* clash with the pillar—if activated, misfortune arises.\nThe Surprise Gate in *Kan*—time passes in vain.\nOne will surely incur delays, returning home after repeated trials.\n\n**Lower Era**\n*Dead Gate*　　　　　　*Open Gate*\n*Great Yin*　　　　　　*True Yang* (for yang years)\n\nThe *fu*-symbol moves in sequence. *Jing* Gate aligns with *Rest* Gate, six with the Nine Heavens.\n\n**Upper Era**\n*Pillar* Gate　　　　　　*Life* Gate\n*Gouchen*　　　　　　Nine Earths\n\nIn yin years, begin at *zi* and proceed in reverse. From the year, determine the first month; from the month, proceed to the first day. If it meets the *Open* Gate, one enjoys peace from beginning to end, favor and grace overflow, and an audience with the sovereign. If it meets the *Rest* Gate, myriad affairs flourish, governance earns praise, and the Nine Heavens resound with acclaim. If it meets the *Life* Gate, rule is achieved without force; the eight directions yield without contest, and the Nine Earths submit in harmony. If it meets the *Jing* Gate, one gains public recognition and recommendation, fame spreads through the Six Harmonies, and imperial summons descend like wings. If it meets the *Restriction* Gate, *Gouchen* ascends above; water, fire, bandits, and thieves require vigilant preparation and regulation. If it meets the *Dead* Gate, *Great Yin* descends below; commands lose their rectitude, and mourning arrives swiftly. The *Wounding* and *Surprise* Gates lie in the directions of sun and moon; if the day encounters these two omens, hasten to conceal oneself.\n\nWhenever the day is auspicious, one must also seek a favorable hour. When stars and gates align propitiously, great achievement is assured. Any encounter with *bei*-comets or clashes hinders official advancement. If *fu*-symbols and affairs conflict, failure and misfortune arise at once. When three auspicious gates stand together, one attains lasting eminence.\n\n**Battle and Combat Section**\nFor any engagement in battle, first examine the day and hour. In yang hours, raise drums, sound bells, and unfurl banners. In yin hours, lie in ambush to diminish the enemy’s might. If our forces are few, we remain secure; if theirs are many, they face peril. In sudden clashes, follow the gates and secure the auspicious. Standing at *Tianyi*, blades shatter for a thousand miles. Next, occupy the *Direct Affair* position, and the enemy will fear like thunder. Strike from behind the living, attack the dead—victory is certain.\n\nWhen skies are overcast and rain falls heavily, the four directions grow dim. Without clepsydra, distinguishing hours becomes difficult; one must rely on the moving *shi*-diagram or observe the *qi*. When *Qi* Gates converge, this is known in *si*, *wu*, and *wei*. If the day’s general coincides with the *Qi* Gate, they share the same rank. There are also three victories: the method of standing firm, striking the *White Traitor*, and facing the *Heavenly Gate*. Also, turn away from the moon’s establishment and next from the *Life Spirit*. When two stars enter one another, the *Horse* position vanishes. If all four directions scatter, security cannot be assured even at dawn or dusk. When *fu*-symbols align with *White*, the army suffers great loss. Under *Great Punishment* or *Flying*, chariots and horses are damaged and lost. When the Nine Stars weaken, defeat saps the soul.\n\nAbove the Nine Heavens, one may grandly display might. Below the Nine Earths, one may guard encampments. In the palace of *Great Yin*, concealment is as if divine. In the palace of the *Six Harmonies*, secret plans are stealthily executed. Great inauspiciousness and great slaughter occur when the palace is violated by *Gouchen*. *Jia* and *bing* interact, embodying the numen of power and virtue. The upper five are yang dwellings; the lower three are auspicious stars. If *Qi* Gates are not oppressed and star positions do not clash, applying these four principles ensures all affairs will be at peace.\n\nWhen the hour’s stem overcomes the day, generals and lords gain hollow reputations. In marching armies or deploying formations, defeat and ruin follow. At rest, obscurity prevails; in action, no glory is won. When *bing* aligns with the *Dead* Gate, rebellion and chaos take shape. When *Dead* aligns with *bing*-auspicious, formations dissolve in chaos. When *bing* aligns with the *Wounding* Gate, battle brings ruin. When *Wounding* aligns with *bing*-auspicious, internal strife erupts. When *yi* aligns with the *Dead* Gate, encampments stand empty. When *Dead* aligns with *yi*-auspicious, weapons are lost. When *yi* aligns with the *Wounding* Gate, attacks must not be launched. When *Wounding* aligns with *yi*-auspicious, defeat is beyond recovery. If such configurations appear, the general must be cautious. Do not engage an advancing enemy; do not pursue a retreating one.\n\nI impart to you one method: sever a peach branch from the shade, inscribe a talisman on its bark, and tread upon the *Dou*-ladle’s handle. Transform grasses and trees into soldiers to bolster our military might. Contend for mountains and seize strategic points to break enemy encirclements. Like casting a flaw at an egg, act in accord with the celestial patterns. Yet do not indulge in wanton slaughter, lest you incur delays. I admonish you, O accomplished general: rectify your heart and do not stray.\n\n**Karmic Destiny and Human Relations Section**\nHuman bonds and marriages follow the diagrams of yin and yang. The *Zhoutang* and *Heavenly Auspice* take *East Zhen* as their model. In months with many days, begin at *Kan* and proceed to *Gen*’s door. In months with few days, begin at *Dui* and proceed in reverse to *Kun*’s corner. Entering *Xun* harms the father-in-law; entering *Gen* replaces the mother-in-law. Entering *Gao* wounds the elder brother; entering *Kan* overcomes the husband. Entering *Dui* kills the wife; entering *Qian* brings no misfortune. In the positions of *Qian*, *Kun*, and *Zhen*, blessings gather at the gate. When yin and yang have generals, stems and branches clash. The yin general kills the wife; the yang general kills the husband. When yin and yang lack generals, they align with the celestial tally.\n\nBefore the monthly taboo, take the heavenly stem; after the taboo, take the next branch for support. If stem and branch harmonize with the month, the absence of a general serves as elimination. Though the great method is thus, it does not yet align with the classics. To avoid disaster, first examine the Nine Stars. The Nine Palaces they govern divide fortune and misfortune distinctly. First determine *Tianpeng*, then take *Tianying*. The natures of water and fire bring only calamity.\n\nThe first palace is *Kan*; the second palace is *Kun*. One elder brother and two daughters—this is the present life’s fate. If the gate spirit is inauspicious, parents do not survive. Three wives are killed, and after parting, remarriage follows. When fate enters the *Zhen* palace, children are overcome entirely. If the gate is auspicious, one daughter remains, but the son becomes a disabled person. When fate enters the *Xun* palace, two pairs of children are born. If all are yang, half survive; if all are yin, the line is cut off. Adopting another surname, one must seek an outsider as heir. When fate enters the *Qian* palace, two chambers of children are born. Six sons are reared, three yin and three yang. Daughters are older, sons younger—thus one attains prominence. When fate enters the *Dui* palace, husband and wife do not clash. Four sons and three daughters ensure a peaceful life. When fate enters the *Gen* palace, parents part in life. The wife conceives no children; much loss and weariness follow. When fate enters the *Gao* palace, household and dwelling are not at peace. Abandoning ancestral legacy, many children and grandchildren arise. In later years, one son dissipates the family estate. One daughter brings sorrow; one son attains nobility.\n\nNext are *Tianren*, *Tiannei*, and *Tianqin*. These three stars serve as envoys, their natures ever deep. When fate enters the *Kan* palace, two sons are born. When three yang disasters arrive, the mother falls ill and the son is separated. When fate enters the *Kun* palace, household and dwelling remain unclear.\n\nWhen the gate aligns, fortune follows; when it misaligns, misfortune strikes. Offspring remain unsettled—some take the Dao, some become monks.\n\nWhen fate enters the *Zhen* palace, two daughters are born. They may belong to two different clans, their yin and yang [fates] unclear. If a second wife is afflicted, three marriages are certain.\n\nWhen fate enters the *Xun* palace, four sons and two daughters arise. Children and grandchildren thrive in prosperity; parents gain honor.\n\nWhen fate enters the *Qian* palace, three persons of yin and yang appear. Three yang [forces] harm the wife; three yin [forces] slay the elder brother.\n\nWhen fate enters the *Dui* palace, five sons and six daughters are born. Both monks and Daoists emerge from the household. If the gate is auspicious, this is permitted; if the gate is adverse, harm befalls parents, past and future.\n\nWhen fate enters the *Gen* palace, husband and wife remain unsettled. Eight children are born, each fending for themselves. If the gate is auspicious, peace prevails; if the gate is inauspicious, illness follows.\n\nWhen fate enters the *Li* palace, parents are separated. In old age, two sons are gained, though many are born and few survive. Another marriage follows, making one an adopted son-in-law.\n\nNext are *Tianchong* and *Tianzhu*, with the Metal Spirit governing Wood. When fate enters the *Kan* palace, a wife taken from another household brings hardship. Eight daughters are born, six of whom die away from home.\n\nWhen fate enters the *Kun* palace, youth is lost in dispersion. Of three persons, two are harmed, leaving one solitary in later years.\n\nWhen fate enters the *Zhen* palace, parents are the first to perish. If not them, then brothers or the wife suffer affliction. If the gate is auspicious, one son is born, followed by two daughters. Even if fortune smiles, the maternal lineage is broken.\n\nWhen fate enters the *Xun* palace, five yang and three yin [forces] arise. If the gate is auspicious, it becomes doubly so, and the household flourishes.\n\nWhen fate enters the *Qian* palace, five sons and four daughters are born. Among them, a noble person emerges, though parents are separated.\n\nWhen fate enters the *Gen* palace, daughters outnumber sons. Many wives are afflicted by misfortune; if not, they flee. The entire family’s lineage is cut off, and any remaining son must leave. Eight yang [forces] overcome six, dimming the eyes’ light. A child of another surname is fostered here, with the star residing in *Dui* and *Li*.\n\nNext are *Tianfu* and *Tianxin*, whose blessings run deep.\n\nWhen fate enters the *Kan* palace, five yang [forces] persist. One son flees, while another gains noble renown. The wife suffers childbirth calamity; ancestral wealth is divided and lost.\n\nWhen fate enters the *Kun* palace, three sons and three daughters are born. If four daughters are born, one male offspring is surely lost. Leaving the ancestral home, one may yet become wealthy.\n\nWhen fate enters the *Zhen* palace, four yang [sons] are born. Among them, one attains great nobility, and the household prospers.\n\nWhen fate enters the *Xun* palace, four sons are born. Two grow immensely wealthy; two attain high rank. The lineage endures unbroken, with each generation surpassing the last in nobility.\n\nWhen fate enters the *Qian* palace, a wife taken from another household is afflicted. If not, the lineage is cut off, and the household crumbles to ashes.\n\nWhen fate enters the *Dui* palace, four sons and two daughters are born. The sons perish entirely, and two sets of parents are involved.\n\nWhen fate enters the *Gen* palace, many children are conceived, but only one son survives. The wife afflicts five [others].\n\nWhen fate enters the [missing] palace, [text unclear]. If not, separation follows. Three yang [forces] favor the state. Among them, a noble person emerges, and the household flourishes in abundance.\n\n---\n\n**Ten Thousand Images Unfolding Section**\n\nFor building houses and constructing dwellings, the Nine August Ones hold sway. The essentials lie in the *Qin* and *Fu* stars, with the *Tianxin* star arriving. The odd [trigrams] *Yi* and *Ding* [text unclear], while *Jia* and *Bing* exchange positions, and the palace spirits harmonize with virtue. When the Six *Jia* obtain their proper agents, salary and wealth increase. *Ding* and *Gui* combine; *Yi* and *Xin* share a tomb. When the Three Marvels enter the tomb, how can disaster be avoided? When two stars converge, great punishment or concealment follows. All *bo* and *ge* omens bring immediate sorrow.\n\nFurther examine the transforming *qi*, governed by the divine judgment of the stars. They shift into eight colors, arrayed in the Nine Palaces’ flight. In the Upper Era, the year *Jiazi* begins in *Kan*. The month *Yichou* reverses to *Gaokui*. *Bingyin* resides in *Gen*, proceeding in reverse order. In the Middle Era, the year *Jiazi* begins in *Xun*. The month *Yichou* reverses to *Zhen* as the mediator. In the Lower Era, the year *Jiazi* begins in *Dui*. The month *Yichou* reverses to *Qian* as the opener. Across the sixty positions, the sequence cycles in reverse.\n\nThe method of monthly colors also follows the Three Eras. In the Upper Era, the first month begins in *Gen*, the second in *Dui*, and the third in *Qian*. In the Middle Era, the first month begins in *Kun*, the second in *Kan*, and the third in *Gao*. In the Lower Era, the first month centers in the middle, the second in *Xun* (four), and the third in *Zhen*.\n\nEach palace’s position is fixed, all originating from the central enclosure: one white, two black, three green, four azure, five yellow, six white, seven red (brilliant), eight white, nine purple—the origins of the Eight Trigrams.\n\nFor example, to determine the arrangement, take *Kan* as the model. One white becomes five, starting from the central palace. Two black flies to *Qian*, three green to *Dui*, four azure to *Gen*, five yellow to *Gao*, six white to *Kan*, seven red to *Kun*’s exterior, eight white to *Zhen*, and nine purple to *Xun*.\n\nWhen construction aligns with six white, the *Kaimen*’s essence brings added family members and treasures, with joy and blessings arriving in full. When construction encounters two black, the *Simen*’s essence brings death’s energy. Legal troubles arise, and penal servitude is incurred. Widows, widowers, and couples suffer frequent bereavements.\n\nWhen construction encounters three green, the *Shangmen*’s essence harms pregnant women, causing separation from flesh and blood. Death by violence or hanging occurs, and thieves become intimate.\n\nWhen construction encounters four azure, the *Dumen*’s essence brings official lawsuits and peril, with jaundice plaguing the door. Disaster strikes the master, and misfortune is immediate.\n\nWhen construction encounters five yellow, one offends the plague star. Heads are shaved and cangues locked; the six relations are severed. Doors close in distress, and heavenly calamities strike repeatedly.\n\nWhen construction encounters six white, the *Kaimen*’s essence, in the months of *Hai* and *Zi*, brings added mouths and gold. Daoist priests interact, and unexpected treasures materialize.\n\nWhen construction encounters seven red, the *Jingmen*’s essence [text unclear]. Chronic abdominal ailments arise, and petty people are constantly provoked.\n\nWhen construction encounters eight white, the *Shengmen*’s essence [text unclear]. Family members increase, and the household flourishes.\n\nWhen construction encounters nine purple, the *Jingmen*’s essence [text unclear]. Wealth and joy increase, with clear verification.\n\nThe eight gates of life and orientation follow this same principle.\n\n**Severing Earthly Roots Section**\n\n**Burial Methods**\n\nBurial methods rely on the harmony of stems and branches with the numinous. On days of *Jia* and *Geng*, align with *Shen* and *Yin*. On days of *Bing* and *Ren*, align with *Chen*, *Wu*, and *Shen*. On days of the six *Ji*, align with *Wei* and *You*. On days of the six *Wu*, the *Dunjia* method is unheard of. For *Yi*, *Xin*, *Ding*, and *Gui*, align with *You* and pair accordingly.\n\nThe jade dog barks loudly, the golden rooster crows alone. The earthly tiger does not feed—thus may a thousand springs be preserved. On such days, the mountain’s orientation must accord with the *Qimen*. Below, it connects with earthly stars; above, it aligns with celestial bodies. The sitting mountain and burial site determine fortune or misfortune in advance.\n\n*Yu* corresponds to *Lianzhen*, *Gong* to *Wenqu*, *Zheng* to *Pojun*, *Jiao* to *Jumen*, *Shang* to *Tanlang*—arising from the central courtyard. Next, they fly forth to *Qian*, with *Kan* and *Dui* as neighbors. If *Wenqu* is offended, the household will not prosper. Men wander from their homeland; women become licentious. If *Pojun* is offended, illness and lawsuits never cease. The eldest daughter kills her husband; the eldest son suffers execution. If *Lucun* is offended, descendants die young, hunchbacked and blind. If *Lianzhen* is offended, official troubles entangle, father and son part, and violent death strikes elsewhere.\n\n*Tanlang*, *Wuqu*, *Fubi*, and *Jumen* bring official promotions and treasures, filling the household with blessings. If even one star is present, fame and profit soar. At the time of interment, the nine stars must also be fixed. *Qin Xin* clashes with the auspicious; next is *Fu* and *Tian Ren*. *Simen* conceals the extraordinary, as does *Kaimen*. Within a hundred days of burial, myriad fortunes arrive.\n\nSever the earthly door, erase the roots of death. Heaven and earth are fixed, and all states conceal their forms. The seven malevolent *Ci Xiong Sha* call to their neighbors. Triple the stakes against the three *Sha*, the *Tai Sui*, and all gods. How dare the host of evils dare to approach? Avoid startling *Shang*, harming *Du*, or disturbing *Jing*, *Xiu*, and *Sheng*. Worship the five without encounter, for the gate presses upon the ritual. The three wonders enter the tomb—*Fanfu* and *Fuyin*. *Kan* responds in one year, *Kun* in two springs. The nine palaces bring nine years of calamity. To discern the new and old, the burial site’s orientation holds no difficulty. Gather the mysteries and know without climbing.\n\nFirst determine *Simen*, for it is the method’s foundation. The vanguard assists it; within the burial site’s orientation, prosperity lies beneath the branch, while decline and imprisonment face it. Next, the day’s tomb is the incoming mountain. The *Mingtang* releases water, and *Dengming* returns. The noble one [text unclear]. If reversed, the tiger departs, and the dragon rests at ease.\n\n*Fanyin* of the eight trigrams, the returning dragon seeks. [Text unclear]. The three unions and six harmonies place ancestral graves beside. If yin and yang are incomplete, the later dragon is meager. The four boundaries [text unclear]. To the left and right before the tomb, the branch’s *Shi* is most favorable. *Hai* and *Zi* are separated by water; *Yin* and *Mao* by bridges. *Chou* is a field [text unclear]. Having undergone alterations and robberies, *Si* and *Wu* lie beside cellars. *Shen* is the official road; *Wei* is the village shrine. *You* is the temple; *Xu* is a desolate village. The day’s stem and branch mark the grave; within heaven, the master conceals. Earth gods and earthly generals double in pairs. Where wood is abundant, forests flourish; where water is abundant, streams flow long. Where fire is abundant, light shines; where earth is abundant, peaks rise. Where metal is abundant, rocks abound. The Dao does not propagate in vain.\n\nThis truly communicates with the numinous; the nine earths are not constant.\n\n---\n\n**Seizing Spirits and Capturing Ghosts Section**\n\nAll who live must die. When one offends their life star, longevity ends. To know the directions, begin with the eight trigrams. *Zi*, *Wu*, *Mao*, and *You* mark the beginning of a man’s life. At one year, *Gen* eight; at two years, *Li* nine. A woman’s life centers on five, with *Xun* four in reverse. *Yin*, *Shen*, *Ji*, and *Hai* take five as their standard. At two years, *Qian* six; for women, *Gen* in reverse. *Chen*, *Xu*, *Chou*, and *Wei* begin at *Kun Wei*. At two years, *Zhen* three; for women, *Kun* in reverse. At two years, it is *Kan*. Those who offend it become emaciated. From one to ten years, the remainder flies in sequence.\n\nThe life star’s malevolence lies in the opposing palace—where ghosts and spirits reside. Each attaches to its proper place: *Qian* is the heavenly gate, *Xun* the wind’s door, where the direct agent resides. Ghosts lurk at the fence. *Kan* is the water palace, *Li* the fire府, where the direct agent resides. Ghosts cling to the bedchamber. *Gen* is the hill’s goodness, *Kun* the earthly door, where the direct agent resides. Ghosts attach to the kitchen boy. Beside the *Ao* spirit, *Chen* departs and *You* returns. *Zhen* is the thunder gate, *Dui* the great marsh—within the ancestral hall. *You* departs, and the spirit returns.\n\nThe method of capture and extermination: whether ladder or matchmaker, above earth and below wood. This is the *Ao* mound—above metal and below wood. Who but the blade? The five phases match their images. Combine the forms and deduce. The method to assist childbirth: when yin and yang contend and one of the five phases is lacking, birth is delayed—deeply pitiable. Thus, the heavenly mechanism is revealed, and demons and evil flee. Mother and child separate; later sages emerge. Follow my rescue: for *Zhifu* *Jia* and *Yi*, drench with water. For *Zhifu* *Bing* and *Ding*, let fire encircle. For *Zhifu* *Wu* and *Ji*, let wood tilt. For *Zhifu* *Geng* and *Xin*, let fire burn the perimeter. For *Zhifu* *Ren* and *Gui*, let earth fly in segments. For metal, let it ring and hasten. *Fanyin* and *Fuyin*—the maternal family’s life returns. The five [text unclear] are complete. The descending calamity spirit [text unclear]—do not be startled or afraid. Thus may all be preserved without error. The *Zhishi* in the yang palace gives birth to sons; in the yin position, to daughters. [Text unclear] the great method of reversal and closure. All spirits obey the *Shenxiao* Jade Mansion. The eight trigrams’ thunder drives spirits and seizes ghosts. [Text unclear] the nine palaces turn once—heaven and earth take notice.\n\nFor all who wish to travel far, visit the noble, or marry, to market [text unclear], establish the gate and recite the incantation. First, exit the earthly door. The six *Jia* nine chapters: heaven is round, earth is square. The four seasons and five phases: green, red, white, yellow. *Taiyi* holds me; sun and moon are my light. Yu the Great ordered the Dao; Chi You evaded the army. The green dragon follows the chariot; the white tiger accompanies the journey.\n\nThe Flaming Star leads ahead, dispelling misfortune.\nThe Bright Star and Northern Dipper punish and eradicate calamity.\nFive spirits attend me, circling the four directions.\nThose who face me die; those who turn from me perish.\nTo my left, the altars; to my right, the millet—bandits and thieves hide in fear.\nTravelers encounter fortune; those who stay find goodness.\nWhere the five spirits reside, all needs flourish.\nSwift as the law commands, step with Yu’s pace and conceal.\n\nDraw the tally, close the door, enter the Heavenly Gate from the left.\nStand at the gate and recite the incantation—do not cross the encircling borders.\nHeavenly Gate, Heavenly Gate, today is auspicious and prosperous.\nJade Maidens attend me, wandering at my left and right.\nComing and going in the four directions, I meet no disaster.\nNoble ones who see me rejoice without end.\nAll I seek is as I wish; all affairs are fortunate.\nSwift as the law commands, step with Yu’s pace into the hall.\nStand before the Jade Maidens, recite the incantation again.\nThrice call the Jade Maidens, and the six spirits arrive.\nTest and walk with me to such-and-such a place.\nIn darkness and obscurity, none see my form.\nPeople hear no sound; ghosts perceive no essence.\nThose who favor me gain fortune; those who hate me meet calamity.\nLet no evil ghosts witness my movements.\nThose who face me die; those who pursue me perish.\nAmong thousands, even tens of thousands,\nthose who see me rejoice.\nSwift as the law commands.\n\nWith the left hand, trace the earth and close the door to depart.\nWalk sixty paces—do not look back.\nReceive the spirits’ support; demons and malevolent forces avoid the path.\nShould battle arise, seize spirits and drive them away.\nFirst exit the Heavenly Gate, then recite another incantation:\nGreen Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior,\n*Gouchen*, and *Liuhe* escort me to such-and-such a place.\nHeaven overturns, earth inverts—all nine paths are blocked.\nShould anyone pursue me, they become lost here.\nEast becomes west; south becomes north.\nThose who chase me in chariots break their axles and wheels.\nThose who pursue on horseback have their horses’ eyes covered.\nThose who follow on foot swell their feet.\nThose who chase by boat are swiftly capsized.\nThose who raise arms to attack have their weapons subdue themselves.\nBright Star and Northern Dipper repel enemies for ten thousand *li*.\nThose who plot against me perish; those who pursue me halt.\nThe Oxherd and Weaver Girl transform into rivers.\n[Text unclear] step with Yu’s pace to the right, re-enter the Earthly Door.\nStand at the gate and recite the incantation: *nuò nuò zé zé*.\nWalk without [text unclear], [text unclear].\nHeaven overturns, earth inverts—all desires in the heart are fulfilled.\nFollow my will, and I cause you to be lost.\n[Text unclear], follow the Dipper’s direction, journey with the spirits.\nSwift as the law commands, turn into [text unclear].\n[Text unclear], with heaven pursue essences, moving like thunder and lightning.\nThe eight extremities shine brightly, penetrating all within and without.\nNo being resists; weapons and blades self-destruct.\nThose who plot against me are severed; those who oppose me—\ntheir souls scatter, their spirits wither.\nSwift as the law commands.\n\nSet forth outside the door, lock ghosts and bind spirits.\nThe Jade Maiden’s incantation says: Jade Maiden above, [such-and-such],\ncome swiftly to protect me.\nLet no hundred ghosts or evil forces harm me.\nLet no one see me as a person; let no one recognize me as human.\nThose who see me take me for bundled firewood;\nthose who know me regard me as inhuman.\nOpen only my door, and close all others.\nSwift as the law commands, close the door and depart.\n\nShould battle arise suddenly without cease,\nand urgency demand facing the enemy—\nheaven and earth cannot form.\nWith the left hand, hold a blade and trace the earth for ten days.\nEnter the courtyard at the day’s earthly branch.\nFace south to establish the direction, recite the *Ding* stem’s incantation:\n\"[Such-and-such] *Jia* is in peril—assist and support me.\nConceal and hide me; let no enemy harm me.\nCause their five weapons to shatter themselves.\nThose who face me perish; those who plot against me die.\nEnemies die on their own; in darkness and silence, combatants are bewildered.\nGate and door spirits, [such-and-such], scatter their souls for me.\"\nSwift as the law commands.\n\nExit by turning left. The gate and door spirits must also be known by name.\nIn the *Jiazi* decade: Gate Spirit Xu Yi, Door Spirit Gongsun Qi—\nremove shoes and depart; enemies dare not follow.\nIn the *Jiaxu* decade: Gate Spirit Shi Zhanyu, Door Spirit Xu He—\nshout loudly and depart.\nIn the *Jiashen* decade: Gate Spirit Sima Guang, Door Spirit Tian Ke—\nremove the cap and depart.\nIn the *Jiawu* decade: Gate Spirit Ming Zhong, Door Spirit Gan Xing—\nshake out the robes and depart, closing the door.\nIn the *Jiachen* decade: Gate Spirit Gongsun Cuo, Door Spirit Sima Sheng—\nloosen the hair and depart.\nIn the *Jiayin* decade: Gate Spirit Gongsun Guang, Door Spirit Sima Qiang—\nuntie the sash and depart.\n\nWhen setting up camp, close *Wu* and establish the encampment.\nThe general holds the blade, standing at the Heavenly Gate.\nTake six *dou* of earth from the day’s *Wu* position.\nMark the six *Wu* directions, press the blade, and recite:\n\"South of Mount Tai, north of Mount Heng.\nThieves and bandits do not rise; wolves and tigers do not move.\nThe city walls are firm, like golden barriers.\nA thousand evils, ten thousand wickednesses—none dare approach.\"\nSwift as the law commands.\n[Text unclear], [text unclear], rectify oneself and practice—\na method surely verified.\n\n**Section: Harmonizing the Hundred Spirits**\nHeaven and earth take their positions; mountains and marshes connect *qi*.\nThunder and wind press upon each other; water and fire aid one another.\n[Text unclear], [text unclear].\nBlended and formed, fortune and misfortune are assigned.\n*Liujia* added to *Jia*: Green Dragon emerges from the earth—joyful news surely comes.\nIf the gate aligns, it is auspicious; if the gate is blocked, the star is inauspicious—wealth arrives in vain.\n*Liujia* added to *Yi*: Green Dragon enters the clouds.

When the Curved Array is above, the nation’s destiny is secure and peaceful.\n\n**Water, Fire, Wind, and Thunder Division**\nWind and thunder clash—some swift, some slow. When thunder first sounds, it arises from the four corners. In the years of *shen-zi-chen*, the *Kun* Palace shakes with might. In the years of *yin-wu-xu*, it lingers in the *Gen* Palace. In the years of *hai-mao-wei*, the *Qian* Palace stirs to action. In the years of *si-you-chou*, the *Xun* Palace rumbles with thunder. Though a hundred *li* differ, the branches and stems do not predict it. To know the divisions of the land, observe the year, month, day, and hour:\n*A* governs the Man barbarians, *B* the seas, extending to the Eastern Yi. *C* governs Chu, *D* Mount Tai, the Jiang and Huai, and the southern lands. *E* and *F* govern Han and Wei, the Central Plains and the Yellow and Ji Rivers. *G* governs Qin, *H* Mount Hua, the western lands first. *I* governs Yan, Zhao, and Wei, *J* awaits Changshan. *Zi* governs Zhou’s lands, *chou* Wei and Liaodong. *Yin* governs Zhao and Chu, *mao* Zheng and *shen* Qi. *Chen* governs Jin, Deng, and E; *si* Wei and *wu* Qin. *Wei* governs Liang and Song, *you* Lu and *xu* Zhao. *Xu* governs Wu and Yue as frontiers, *hai* serves as Yan’s matchmaker.\n\nWhen the Directing Envoy approaches *Kun*, the Heavenly Prison is at its peak. The Impetuous Star and White Tiger, the Azure Dragon in the *Kun* corner—if not violent storms, then ceaseless rain; if not wind, then thunder. When ghosts appear in the *Shen* Palace, hail arises without doubt. The Heavenly Impetus, a single star, governs the crashing thunder. Falling in *Qian* or *Xun*, it follows the Peasant Star. If it meets the Vermilion Bird, the Remaining Serpent clings close. When the Injury Gate wields lightning, mountains and peaks collapse. The Dark Warrior and Supreme Yin obscure the Dipper’s brightness. Great Fortune and Small Fortune, the Curved Array and Queen of Heaven—dark clouds scatter at once, and the vast sky reveals rainbows. Sometimes it becomes the Day’s Horse, dense clouds yet no rain. If it attains the Sun’s Fortune, auspicious snow falls in flurries. The Heavenly Chief’s *Yi* star marks the time of ice, snow, and frost. The Queen of the Dark and Dark Warrior follow the Peasant Star in *hai* and *zi*. Heavy snow descends, drifting like jade fragments. If it approaches the Vermilion Bird, ashes scatter in swirls. With the addition of wandering winds, frost piles in mounds. When the Rain Master shares its position, snow and rain fall lightly. The Heavenly Rigor and Victorious Light may become the Sun’s Ruin. When the Directing Envoy enters *Xun*, snow is heavy and thunder roars. Earth’s *qi* leaks first, and yang *qi* retreats in decline. When the Heavenly Chief is in *Zhen*, the Six Harmonies also shake. The Five Thunders serve as envoys, and the method governs great snow. For a month without brightness, [text missing], [text missing] the Heavenly Flower.\n\nA single star, the Fire Bandit, governs *bing* and *geng*. When added to the year and month, the day and hour [text missing]. [Text missing] the Great Unity, the Vermilion Bird and Remaining Serpent. The Day’s Ghost within a hundred *li*—smoldering embers, comets, and broom stars. When the broom star and fire star [text missing], [text missing] summer alike, the Dark Warrior in autumn and winter. When the Curved Array’s five envoys enter *Li* and the Peasant Star, they become assistants to the blazing flame. The Heavenly Pillar, a single star, governs the Water Palace. If it resides in the *Kan* Palace, the Queen of the Dark and Dragon-Tiger [text missing]. The Heavenly Rigor and River Peasant [text missing]. Floods surge in all directions, torrential and unstoppable. Or entering the Void, otherwise punishment and harm. Seedlings are swept away, mountains shift, and earth surges.\n\nWhen the Great Unity forms a union, the Ascending Light and Noble One—when the gods and generals are in prosperity, clouds and rain arise abundantly. When the Robber Star hides within, mountain demons and water curses appear. Forecasting darkness and gloom, observe the solar terms and the heavens. When formations face opposition, the Dark Warrior takes the lead. Next, the White Tiger—when the Robber Star drifts alongside. When the Ascending Light follows the Peasant Star, punishment and harm arrive first. Ceaseless rain in one breath, the activation follows the transmission. On the Nine Emperors’ taboo days, Heaven’s Dao is clear. If it meets the Black Dao, it will not rain but remain overcast. *Jia-wu* and *wu-wu*, *yi-you* and *ji-you*. *Ding-si* and *gui-si*, *ren-yin* and *xin-chou*. Dark mists do not shift—use this to determine misfortune.\n\nIn the divination of wind angles, the mysteries are worthy of transmission. The *Xun* Palace belongs to wood, and wood’s note is *jiao*. The star is called Heavenly Assistant, preceding the Hidden Gate. *Jia-wu* and *jia-chen*—the Wind God’s temple position. The Azure Dragon and White Tiger, the source of Feng Yi. They stir all things, issuing commands. Of the six emotions, *Xun* governs wind and mist.\n\nOn the day of the Beginning of Spring, Heavenly Duty takes charge. The Gentle Wind arrives slowly—this is harmonious *qi*. A headwind is rebellious, bringing armies and bandit troops. When the sky is cloudless, bright and clear. The year is good and bountiful, with seedlings thriving. If yin prevails, drought and injury arise, with locusts as the curse. Grain and beans are damaged, rice and wheat surge in price.

In the eighth month, people are anxious, and the state faces false alarms.\n\nOn the day of the Beginning of Summer, Heaven’s Auxiliary governs *Xun*. Red clouds in the south bring a year of abundance and freedom from illness. Clear skies without clouds foretell opposing winds and drought. When wind comes from *Qian*, summer frost brings famine. Wheat fails first, and many people die in sorrow. When wind comes from *Kan*, frequent wind and rain arise. Fish walk on human paths, and the four directions are filled with sorrow. When wind comes from *Gen*, mountains collapse and the earth quakes. Plague and heavenly disaster strike, and the old and young perish. When wind comes from *Zhen*, thunder arises at the wrong time. It strikes and harms people and things—this is the work of spirits. When wind comes from *Xun*, the year is abundant and the state is at peace. The four directions are clear and solemn, and the eight bounds are properly ordered. When wind comes from above, summer drought scorches the grain. The people grow emaciated, and cities and towns burn. When wind comes from *Kun*, people are often unsettled. The myriad things wither prematurely, and the earth never dries. When wind comes from *Dui*, locusts swarm greatly. Famine’s disaster strikes, and rice shortages are inescapable.\n\nOn the day of the Summer Solstice, Heaven’s Blaze governs it. When the *Jing* wind arrives, it is auspicious; when opposed, it is inauspicious. Red *qi* in the south brings state stability and people’s abundance. Clear skies foretell drought, and rivers run dry while mountains collapse. When wind comes from *Qian*, cold harms the myriad things. Warfare, floods, and autumn-winter inundations follow. When wind comes from *Kan*, the four seasons lose their rhythm. Summer brings much cold, and people are injured until they bleed. When wind comes from *Gen*, mountains and rivers surge violently. The people face disaster, and graves gain new mounds. When wind comes from *Zhen*, plagues and omens abound. Pestilence never leaves the door, and it manifests in the eighth month.

Autumn’s *qi* is solemn and clear, and flowers and trees flourish doubly. When wind comes from *Kun*, the sixth month brings ceaseless rain. As the Beginning of Autumn nears, water surges and overflows.\n\nOn the day of the Beginning of Autumn, Heaven’s Interior governs it. Cool winds blow gently, and the people relax.

In the *Kan* palace, sinking and drowning occur, and spirits and ghosts... Should they wander to *Gen*, a thousand years of continuity unfold. *Kun* does not endure long, nor does *Dui* remain firm. Though spirits and ghosts possess power, humans may yet prevail. I impart to you this method—bear it in mind. When spirits and ghosts harass people, gather stones in *Qian*. If the stone weighs a hundred *jin*, spirits and ghosts incur transgressions. If the stone weighs a thousand *jin*, the offense reaches the heavens. Bury the name below, and earth deities will appear. They will be bound to the nether darkness, never to return. The paths of humans and spirits diverge—this has been the eternal source. Spirits and deities, heed this: hasten to conceal yourselves.\n\nThe *Libao Juxuan* Section\nThe *Juxuan Yijing* states: When *Ren* is added to the fleeing formula, *Bing* is called the Luminous Realm, and *Geng* is named Venus.

When the Moon Breaker and Moon Void appear, wine and feasting are abundant. When the Moon Punishment and Moon Killer appear, wealth and profit are not lost.

When Vermilion Bird and Victorious Serpent appear, with Great Unity in the same place, the great are uplifted, and the petty admire. Three is the Land of Life—do not meet White Tiger. When Post Horse and *Congkui* appear, with Great Yin in attendance, life turns to death, fortune reverses to bitter misfortune. If one hears crows cawing, swiftly observe the Scenic Gate. The one before the Direct Spirit brings coercion and urgency. Evil men coerce and deceive, demanding money. The second ahead brings disputes, the third marriage. Otherwise, lawsuits and clamorous arguments fill the gate. The fourth ahead brings brawls, competing for wealth. The one behind the Direct Spirit involves women. The second behind brings fraud and deceit, with lewdness and adultery sprouting. The third behind brings loss, clothing and [text unclear] vanish.

      "translated_text": "The *fu*-symbol moves in sequence. *Jing* Gate aligns with *Rest* Gate, six with the Nine Heavens.\n\n**Upper Era**\n*Pillar* Gate　　　　　　*Life* Gate\n*Gouchen*　　　　　　Nine Earths\n\nIn yin years, begin at *zi* and proceed in reverse. From the year, determine the first month; from the month, proceed to the first day. If it meets the *Open* Gate, one enjoys peace from beginning to end, favor and grace overflow, and an audience with the sovereign. If it meets the *Rest* Gate, myriad affairs flourish, governance earns praise, and the Nine Heavens resound with acclaim. If it meets the *Life* Gate, rule is achieved without force; the eight directions yield without contest, and the Nine Earths submit in harmony. If it meets the *Jing* Gate, one gains public recognition and recommendation, fame spreads through the Six Harmonies, and imperial summons descend like wings. If it meets the *Restriction* Gate, *Gouchen* ascends above; water, fire, bandits, and thieves require vigilant preparation and regulation. If it meets the *Dead* Gate, *Great Yin* descends below; commands lose their rectitude, and mourning arrives swiftly. The *Wounding* and *Surprise* Gates lie in the directions of sun and moon; if the day encounters these two omens, hasten to conceal oneself.\n\nWhenever the day is auspicious, one must also seek a favorable hour. When stars and gates align propitiously, great achievement is assured. Any encounter with *bei*-comets or clashes hinders official advancement. If *fu*-symbols and affairs conflict, failure and misfortune arise at once. When three auspicious gates stand together, one attains lasting eminence.\n\n**Battle and Combat Section**\nFor any engagement in battle, first examine the day and hour. In yang hours, raise drums, sound bells, and unfurl banners. In yin hours, lie in ambush to diminish the enemy’s might. If our forces are few, we remain secure; if theirs are many, they face peril. In sudden clashes, follow the gates and secure the auspicious. Standing at *Tianyi*, blades shatter for a thousand miles. Next, occupy the *Direct Affair* position, and the enemy will fear like thunder. Strike from behind the living, attack the dead—victory is certain.\n\nWhen skies are overcast and rain falls heavily, the four directions grow dim. Without clepsydra, distinguishing hours becomes difficult; one must rely on the moving *shi*-diagram or observe the *qi*. When *Qi* Gates converge, this is known in *si*, *wu*, and *wei*. If the day’s general coincides with the *Qi* Gate, they share the same rank. There are also three victories: the method of standing firm, striking the *White Traitor*, and facing the *Heavenly Gate*. Also, turn away from the moon’s establishment and next from the *Life Spirit*. When two stars enter one another, the *Horse* position vanishes. If all four directions scatter, security cannot be assured even at dawn or dusk. When *fu*-symbols align with *White*, the army suffers great loss. Under *Great Punishment* or *Flying*, chariots and horses are damaged and lost. When the Nine Stars weaken, defeat saps the soul.\n\nAbove the Nine Heavens, one may grandly display might. Below the Nine Earths, one may guard encampments. In the palace of *Great Yin*, concealment is as if divine. In the palace of the *Six Harmonies*, secret plans are stealthily executed. Great inauspiciousness and great slaughter occur when the palace is violated by *Gouchen*. *Jia* and *bing* interact, embodying the numen of power and virtue. The upper five are yang dwellings; the lower three are auspicious stars. If *Qi* Gates are not oppressed and star positions do not clash, applying these four principles ensures all affairs will be at peace.\n\nWhen the hour’s stem overcomes the day, generals and lords gain hollow reputations. In marching armies or deploying formations, defeat and ruin follow. At rest, obscurity prevails; in action, no glory is won. When *bing* aligns with the *Dead* Gate, rebellion and chaos take shape. When *Dead* aligns with *bing*-auspicious, formations dissolve in chaos. When *bing* aligns with the *Wounding* Gate, battle brings ruin. When *Wounding* aligns with *bing*-auspicious, internal strife erupts. When *yi* aligns with the *Dead* Gate, encampments stand empty. When *Dead* aligns with *yi*-auspicious, weapons are lost. When *yi* aligns with the *Wounding* Gate, attacks must not be launched. When *Wounding* aligns with *yi*-auspicious, defeat is beyond recovery. If such configurations appear, the general must be cautious. Do not engage an advancing enemy; do not pursue a retreating one.\n\nI impart to you one method: sever a peach branch from the shade, inscribe a talisman on its bark, and tread upon the *Dou*-ladle’s handle. Transform grasses and trees into soldiers to bolster our military might. Contend for mountains and seize strategic points to break enemy encirclements. Like casting a flaw at an egg, act in accord with the celestial patterns. Yet do not indulge in wanton slaughter, lest you incur delays. I admonish you, O accomplished general: rectify your heart and do not stray.\n\n**Karmic Destiny and Human Relations Section**\nHuman bonds and marriages follow the diagrams of yin and yang. The *Zhoutang* and *Heavenly Auspice* take *East Zhen* as their model. In months with many days, begin at *Kan* and proceed to *Gen*’s door. In months with few days, begin at *Dui* and proceed in reverse to *Kun*’s corner. Entering *Xun* harms the father-in-law; entering *Gen* replaces the mother-in-law. Entering *Gao* wounds the elder brother; entering *Kan* overcomes the husband. Entering *Dui* kills the wife; entering *Qian* brings no misfortune. In the positions of *Qian*, *Kun*, and *Zhen*, blessings gather at the gate. When yin and yang have generals, stems and branches clash. The yin general kills the wife; the yang general kills the husband. When yin and yang lack generals, they align with the celestial tally.\n\nBefore the monthly taboo, take the heavenly stem; after the taboo, take the next branch for support. If stem and branch harmonize with the month, the absence of a general serves as elimination. Though the great method is thus, it does not yet align with the classics. To avoid disaster, first examine the Nine Stars. The Nine Palaces they govern divide fortune and misfortune distinctly. First determine *Tianpeng*, then take *Tianying*. The natures of water and fire bring only calamity.\n\nThe first palace is *Kan*; the second palace is *Kun*. One elder brother and two daughters—this is the present life’s fate. If the gate spirit is inauspicious, parents do not survive. Three wives are killed, and after parting, remarriage follows. When fate enters the *Zhen* palace, children are overcome entirely. If the gate is auspicious, one daughter remains, but the son becomes a disabled person. When fate enters the *Xun* palace, two pairs of children are born. If all are yang, half survive; if all are yin, the line is cut off. Adopting another surname, one must seek an outsider as heir. When fate enters the *Qian* palace, two chambers of children are born. Six sons are reared, three yin and three yang. Daughters are older, sons younger—thus one attains prominence. When fate enters the *Dui* palace, husband and wife do not clash. Four sons and three daughters ensure a peaceful life. When fate enters the *Gen* palace, parents part in life. The wife conceives no children; much loss and weariness follow. When fate enters the *Gao* palace, household and dwelling are not at peace. Abandoning ancestral legacy, many children and grandchildren arise. In later years, one son dissipates the family estate. One daughter brings sorrow; one son attains nobility.\n\nNext are *Tianren*, *Tiannei*, and *Tianqin*. These three stars serve as envoys, their natures ever deep. When fate enters the *Kan* palace, two sons are born. When three yang disasters arrive, the mother falls ill and the son is separated. When fate enters the *Kun* palace, household and dwelling remain unclear.",

      "translated_text": "When the gate aligns, fortune follows; when it misaligns, misfortune strikes. Offspring remain unsettled—some take the Dao, some become monks.\n\nWhen fate enters the *Zhen* palace, two daughters are born. They may belong to two different clans, their yin and yang [fates] unclear. If a second wife is afflicted, three marriages are certain.\n\nWhen fate enters the *Xun* palace, four sons and two daughters arise. Children and grandchildren thrive in prosperity; parents gain honor.\n\nWhen fate enters the *Qian* palace, three persons of yin and yang appear. Three yang [forces] harm the wife; three yin [forces] slay the elder brother.\n\nWhen fate enters the *Dui* palace, five sons and six daughters are born. Both monks and Daoists emerge from the household. If the gate is auspicious, this is permitted; if the gate is adverse, harm befalls parents, past and future.\n\nWhen fate enters the *Gen* palace, husband and wife remain unsettled. Eight children are born, each fending for themselves. If the gate is auspicious, peace prevails; if the gate is inauspicious, illness follows.\n\nWhen fate enters the *Li* palace, parents are separated. In old age, two sons are gained, though many are born and few survive. Another marriage follows, making one an adopted son-in-law.\n\nNext are *Tianchong* and *Tianzhu*, with the Metal Spirit governing Wood. When fate enters the *Kan* palace, a wife taken from another household brings hardship. Eight daughters are born, six of whom die away from home.\n\nWhen fate enters the *Kun* palace, youth is lost in dispersion. Of three persons, two are harmed, leaving one solitary in later years.\n\nWhen fate enters the *Zhen* palace, parents are the first to perish. If not them, then brothers or the wife suffer affliction. If the gate is auspicious, one son is born, followed by two daughters. Even if fortune smiles, the maternal lineage is broken.\n\nWhen fate enters the *Xun* palace, five yang and three yin [forces] arise. If the gate is auspicious, it becomes doubly so, and the household flourishes.\n\nWhen fate enters the *Qian* palace, five sons and four daughters are born. Among them, a noble person emerges, though parents are separated.\n\nWhen fate enters the *Gen* palace, daughters outnumber sons. Many wives are afflicted by misfortune; if not, they flee. The entire family’s lineage is cut off, and any remaining son must leave. Eight yang [forces] overcome six, dimming the eyes’ light. A child of another surname is fostered here, with the star residing in *Dui* and *Li*.\n\nNext are *Tianfu* and *Tianxin*, whose blessings run deep.\n\nWhen fate enters the *Kan* palace, five yang [forces] persist. One son flees, while another gains noble renown. The wife suffers childbirth calamity; ancestral wealth is divided and lost.\n\nWhen fate enters the *Kun* palace, three sons and three daughters are born. If four daughters are born, one male offspring is surely lost. Leaving the ancestral home, one may yet become wealthy.\n\nWhen fate enters the *Zhen* palace, four yang [sons] are born. Among them, one attains great nobility, and the household prospers.\n\nWhen fate enters the *Xun* palace, four sons are born. Two grow immensely wealthy; two attain high rank. The lineage endures unbroken, with each generation surpassing the last in nobility.\n\nWhen fate enters the *Qian* palace, a wife taken from another household is afflicted. If not, the lineage is cut off, and the household crumbles to ashes.\n\nWhen fate enters the *Dui* palace, four sons and two daughters are born. The sons perish entirely, and two sets of parents are involved.\n\nWhen fate enters the *Gen* palace, many children are conceived, but only one son survives. The wife afflicts five [others].\n\nWhen fate enters the [missing] palace, [text unclear]. If not, separation follows. Three yang [forces] favor the state. Among them, a noble person emerges, and the household flourishes in abundance.\n\n---\n\n**Ten Thousand Images Unfolding Section**\n\nFor building houses and constructing dwellings, the Nine August Ones hold sway. The essentials lie in the *Qin* and *Fu* stars, with the *Tianxin* star arriving. The odd [trigrams] *Yi* and *Ding* [text unclear], while *Jia* and *Bing* exchange positions, and the palace spirits harmonize with virtue. When the Six *Jia* obtain their proper agents, salary and wealth increase. *Ding* and *Gui* combine; *Yi* and *Xin* share a tomb. When the Three Marvels enter the tomb, how can disaster be avoided? When two stars converge, great punishment or concealment follows. All *bo* and *ge* omens bring immediate sorrow.\n\nFurther examine the transforming *qi*, governed by the divine judgment of the stars. They shift into eight colors, arrayed in the Nine Palaces’ flight. In the Upper Era, the year *Jiazi* begins in *Kan*. The month *Yichou* reverses to *Gaokui*. *Bingyin* resides in *Gen*, proceeding in reverse order. In the Middle Era, the year *Jiazi* begins in *Xun*. The month *Yichou* reverses to *Zhen* as the mediator. In the Lower Era, the year *Jiazi* begins in *Dui*. The month *Yichou* reverses to *Qian* as the opener. Across the sixty positions, the sequence cycles in reverse.\n\nThe method of monthly colors also follows the Three Eras. In the Upper Era, the first month begins in *Gen*, the second in *Dui*, and the third in *Qian*. In the Middle Era, the first month begins in *Kun*, the second in *Kan*, and the third in *Gao*. In the Lower Era, the first month centers in the middle, the second in *Xun* (four), and the third in *Zhen*.\n\nEach palace’s position is fixed, all originating from the central enclosure: one white, two black, three green, four azure, five yellow, six white, seven red (brilliant), eight white, nine purple—the origins of the Eight Trigrams.\n\nFor example, to determine the arrangement, take *Kan* as the model. One white becomes five, starting from the central palace. Two black flies to *Qian*, three green to *Dui*, four azure to *Gen*, five yellow to *Gao*, six white to *Kan*, seven red to *Kun*’s exterior, eight white to *Zhen*, and nine purple to *Xun*.\n\nWhen construction aligns with six white, the *Kaimen*’s essence brings added family members and treasures, with joy and blessings arriving in full. When construction encounters two black, the *Simen*’s essence brings death’s energy. Legal troubles arise, and penal servitude is incurred. Widows, widowers, and couples suffer frequent bereavements.\n\nWhen construction encounters three green, the *Shangmen*’s essence harms pregnant women, causing separation from flesh and blood. Death by violence or hanging occurs, and thieves become intimate.\n\nWhen construction encounters four azure, the *Dumen*’s essence brings official lawsuits and peril, with jaundice plaguing the door. Disaster strikes the master, and misfortune is immediate.\n\nWhen construction encounters five yellow, one offends the plague star. Heads are shaved and cangues locked; the six relations are severed. Doors close in distress, and heavenly calamities strike repeatedly.\n\nWhen construction encounters six white, the *Kaimen*’s essence, in the months of *Hai* and *Zi*, brings added mouths and gold. Daoist priests interact, and unexpected treasures materialize.\n\nWhen construction encounters seven red, the *Jingmen*’s essence [text unclear]. Chronic abdominal ailments arise, and petty people are constantly provoked.\n\nWhen construction encounters eight white, the *Shengmen*’s essence [text unclear]. Family members increase, and the household flourishes.\n\nWhen construction encounters nine purple, the *Jingmen*’s essence [text unclear]. Wealth and joy increase, with clear verification.\n\nThe eight gates of life and orientation follow this same principle.\n\n**Severing Earthly Roots Section**",

      "translated_text": "**Burial Methods**\n\nBurial methods rely on the harmony of stems and branches with the numinous. On days of *Jia* and *Geng*, align with *Shen* and *Yin*. On days of *Bing* and *Ren*, align with *Chen*, *Wu*, and *Shen*. On days of the six *Ji*, align with *Wei* and *You*. On days of the six *Wu*, the *Dunjia* method is unheard of. For *Yi*, *Xin*, *Ding*, and *Gui*, align with *You* and pair accordingly.\n\nThe jade dog barks loudly, the golden rooster crows alone. The earthly tiger does not feed—thus may a thousand springs be preserved. On such days, the mountain’s orientation must accord with the *Qimen*. Below, it connects with earthly stars; above, it aligns with celestial bodies. The sitting mountain and burial site determine fortune or misfortune in advance.\n\n*Yu* corresponds to *Lianzhen*, *Gong* to *Wenqu*, *Zheng* to *Pojun*, *Jiao* to *Jumen*, *Shang* to *Tanlang*—arising from the central courtyard. Next, they fly forth to *Qian*, with *Kan* and *Dui* as neighbors. If *Wenqu* is offended, the household will not prosper. Men wander from their homeland; women become licentious. If *Pojun* is offended, illness and lawsuits never cease. The eldest daughter kills her husband; the eldest son suffers execution. If *Lucun* is offended, descendants die young, hunchbacked and blind. If *Lianzhen* is offended, official troubles entangle, father and son part, and violent death strikes elsewhere.\n\n*Tanlang*, *Wuqu*, *Fubi*, and *Jumen* bring official promotions and treasures, filling the household with blessings. If even one star is present, fame and profit soar. At the time of interment, the nine stars must also be fixed. *Qin Xin* clashes with the auspicious; next is *Fu* and *Tian Ren*. *Simen* conceals the extraordinary, as does *Kaimen*. Within a hundred days of burial, myriad fortunes arrive.\n\nSever the earthly door, erase the roots of death. Heaven and earth are fixed, and all states conceal their forms. The seven malevolent *Ci Xiong Sha* call to their neighbors. Triple the stakes against the three *Sha*, the *Tai Sui*, and all gods. How dare the host of evils dare to approach? Avoid startling *Shang*, harming *Du*, or disturbing *Jing*, *Xiu*, and *Sheng*. Worship the five without encounter, for the gate presses upon the ritual. The three wonders enter the tomb—*Fanfu* and *Fuyin*. *Kan* responds in one year, *Kun* in two springs. The nine palaces bring nine years of calamity. To discern the new and old, the burial site’s orientation holds no difficulty. Gather the mysteries and know without climbing.\n\nFirst determine *Simen*, for it is the method’s foundation. The vanguard assists it; within the burial site’s orientation, prosperity lies beneath the branch, while decline and imprisonment face it. Next, the day’s tomb is the incoming mountain. The *Mingtang* releases water, and *Dengming* returns. The noble one [text unclear]. If reversed, the tiger departs, and the dragon rests at ease.\n\n*Fanyin* of the eight trigrams, the returning dragon seeks. [Text unclear]. The three unions and six harmonies place ancestral graves beside. If yin and yang are incomplete, the later dragon is meager. The four boundaries [text unclear]. To the left and right before the tomb, the branch’s *Shi* is most favorable. *Hai* and *Zi* are separated by water; *Yin* and *Mao* by bridges. *Chou* is a field [text unclear]. Having undergone alterations and robberies, *Si* and *Wu* lie beside cellars. *Shen* is the official road; *Wei* is the village shrine. *You* is the temple; *Xu* is a desolate village. The day’s stem and branch mark the grave; within heaven, the master conceals. Earth gods and earthly generals double in pairs. Where wood is abundant, forests flourish; where water is abundant, streams flow long. Where fire is abundant, light shines; where earth is abundant, peaks rise. Where metal is abundant, rocks abound. The Dao does not propagate in vain.\n\nThis truly communicates with the numinous; the nine earths are not constant.\n\n---\n\n**Seizing Spirits and Capturing Ghosts Section**\n\nAll who live must die. When one offends their life star, longevity ends. To know the directions, begin with the eight trigrams. *Zi*, *Wu*, *Mao*, and *You* mark the beginning of a man’s life. At one year, *Gen* eight; at two years, *Li* nine. A woman’s life centers on five, with *Xun* four in reverse. *Yin*, *Shen*, *Ji*, and *Hai* take five as their standard. At two years, *Qian* six; for women, *Gen* in reverse. *Chen*, *Xu*, *Chou*, and *Wei* begin at *Kun Wei*. At two years, *Zhen* three; for women, *Kun* in reverse. At two years, it is *Kan*. Those who offend it become emaciated. From one to ten years, the remainder flies in sequence.\n\nThe life star’s malevolence lies in the opposing palace—where ghosts and spirits reside. Each attaches to its proper place: *Qian* is the heavenly gate, *Xun* the wind’s door, where the direct agent resides. Ghosts lurk at the fence. *Kan* is the water palace, *Li* the fire府, where the direct agent resides. Ghosts cling to the bedchamber. *Gen* is the hill’s goodness, *Kun* the earthly door, where the direct agent resides. Ghosts attach to the kitchen boy. Beside the *Ao* spirit, *Chen* departs and *You* returns. *Zhen* is the thunder gate, *Dui* the great marsh—within the ancestral hall. *You* departs, and the spirit returns.\n\nThe method of capture and extermination: whether ladder or matchmaker, above earth and below wood. This is the *Ao* mound—above metal and below wood. Who but the blade? The five phases match their images. Combine the forms and deduce. The method to assist childbirth: when yin and yang contend and one of the five phases is lacking, birth is delayed—deeply pitiable. Thus, the heavenly mechanism is revealed, and demons and evil flee. Mother and child separate; later sages emerge. Follow my rescue: for *Zhifu* *Jia* and *Yi*, drench with water. For *Zhifu* *Bing* and *Ding*, let fire encircle. For *Zhifu* *Wu* and *Ji*, let wood tilt. For *Zhifu* *Geng* and *Xin*, let fire burn the perimeter. For *Zhifu* *Ren* and *Gui*, let earth fly in segments. For metal, let it ring and hasten. *Fanyin* and *Fuyin*—the maternal family’s life returns. The five [text unclear] are complete. The descending calamity spirit [text unclear]—do not be startled or afraid. Thus may all be preserved without error. The *Zhishi* in the yang palace gives birth to sons; in the yin position, to daughters. [Text unclear] the great method of reversal and closure. All spirits obey the *Shenxiao* Jade Mansion. The eight trigrams’ thunder drives spirits and seizes ghosts. [Text unclear] the nine palaces turn once—heaven and earth take notice.\n\nFor all who wish to travel far, visit the noble, or marry, to market [text unclear], establish the gate and recite the incantation. First, exit the earthly door. The six *Jia* nine chapters: heaven is round, earth is square. The four seasons and five phases: green, red, white, yellow. *Taiyi* holds me; sun and moon are my light. Yu the Great ordered the Dao; Chi You evaded the army. The green dragon follows the chariot; the white tiger accompanies the journey.",

When the Great Year acts as [text missing], with the Spirit Sovereign added, water bursts forth and mountains collapse. When the Curved Array is above, the nation’s destiny is secure and peaceful.\n\n**Water, Fire, Wind, and Thunder Division**\nWind and thunder clash—some swift, some slow. When thunder first sounds, it arises from the four corners. In the years of *shen-zi-chen*, the *Kun* Palace shakes with might. In the years of *yin-wu-xu*, it lingers in the *Gen* Palace. In the years of *hai-mao-wei*, the *Qian* Palace stirs to action. In the years of *si-you-chou*, the *Xun* Palace rumbles with thunder. Though a hundred *li* differ, the branches and stems do not predict it. To know the divisions of the land, observe the year, month, day, and hour:\n*A* governs the Man barbarians, *B* the seas, extending to the Eastern Yi. *C* governs Chu, *D* Mount Tai, the Jiang and Huai, and the southern lands. *E* and *F* govern Han and Wei, the Central Plains and the Yellow and Ji Rivers. *G* governs Qin, *H* Mount Hua, the western lands first. *I* governs Yan, Zhao, and Wei, *J* awaits Changshan. *Zi* governs Zhou’s lands, *chou* Wei and Liaodong. *Yin* governs Zhao and Chu, *mao* Zheng and *shen* Qi. *Chen* governs Jin, Deng, and E; *si* Wei and *wu* Qin. *Wei* governs Liang and Song, *you* Lu and *xu* Zhao. *Xu* governs Wu and Yue as frontiers, *hai* serves as Yan’s matchmaker.\n\nWhen the Directing Envoy approaches *Kun*, the Heavenly Prison is at its peak. The Impetuous Star and White Tiger, the Azure Dragon in the *Kun* corner—if not violent storms, then ceaseless rain; if not wind, then thunder. When ghosts appear in the *Shen* Palace, hail arises without doubt. The Heavenly Impetus, a single star, governs the crashing thunder. Falling in *Qian* or *Xun*, it follows the Peasant Star. If it meets the Vermilion Bird, the Remaining Serpent clings close. When the Injury Gate wields lightning, mountains and peaks collapse. The Dark Warrior and Supreme Yin obscure the Dipper’s brightness. Great Fortune and Small Fortune, the Curved Array and Queen of Heaven—dark clouds scatter at once, and the vast sky reveals rainbows. Sometimes it becomes the Day’s Horse, dense clouds yet no rain. If it attains the Sun’s Fortune, auspicious snow falls in flurries. The Heavenly Chief’s *Yi* star marks the time of ice, snow, and frost. The Queen of the Dark and Dark Warrior follow the Peasant Star in *hai* and *zi*. Heavy snow descends, drifting like jade fragments. If it approaches the Vermilion Bird, ashes scatter in swirls. With the addition of wandering winds, frost piles in mounds. When the Rain Master shares its position, snow and rain fall lightly. The Heavenly Rigor and Victorious Light may become the Sun’s Ruin. When the Directing Envoy enters *Xun*, snow is heavy and thunder roars. Earth’s *qi* leaks first, and yang *qi* retreats in decline. When the Heavenly Chief is in *Zhen*, the Six Harmonies also shake. The Five Thunders serve as envoys, and the method governs great snow. For a month without brightness, [text missing], [text missing] the Heavenly Flower.\n\nA single star, the Fire Bandit, governs *bing* and *geng*. When added to the year and month, the day and hour [text missing]. [Text missing] the Great Unity, the Vermilion Bird and Remaining Serpent. The Day’s Ghost within a hundred *li*—smoldering embers, comets, and broom stars. When the broom star and fire star [text missing], [text missing] summer alike, the Dark Warrior in autumn and winter. When the Curved Array’s five envoys enter *Li* and the Peasant Star, they become assistants to the blazing flame. The Heavenly Pillar, a single star, governs the Water Palace. If it resides in the *Kan* Palace, the Queen of the Dark and Dragon-Tiger [text missing]. The Heavenly Rigor and River Peasant [text missing]. Floods surge in all directions, torrential and unstoppable. Or entering the Void, otherwise punishment and harm. Seedlings are swept away, mountains shift, and earth surges.\n\nWhen the Great Unity forms a union, the Ascending Light and Noble One—when the gods and generals are in prosperity, clouds and rain arise abundantly. When the Robber Star hides within, mountain demons and water curses appear. Forecasting darkness and gloom, observe the solar terms and the heavens. When formations face opposition, the Dark Warrior takes the lead. Next, the White Tiger—when the Robber Star drifts alongside. When the Ascending Light follows the Peasant Star, punishment and harm arrive first. Ceaseless rain in one breath, the activation follows the transmission. On the Nine Emperors’ taboo days, Heaven’s Dao is clear. If it meets the Black Dao, it will not rain but remain overcast. *Jia-wu* and *wu-wu*, *yi-you* and *ji-you*. *Ding-si* and *gui-si*, *ren-yin* and *xin-chou*. Dark mists do not shift—use this to determine misfortune.\n\nIn the divination of wind angles, the mysteries are worthy of transmission. The *Xun* Palace belongs to wood, and wood’s note is *jiao*. The star is called Heavenly Assistant, preceding the Hidden Gate. *Jia-wu* and *jia-chen*—the Wind God’s temple position. The Azure Dragon and White Tiger, the source of Feng Yi. They stir all things, issuing commands. Of the six emotions, *Xun* governs wind and mist.\n\nOn the day of the Beginning of Spring, Heavenly Duty takes charge. The Gentle Wind arrives slowly—this is harmonious *qi*. A headwind is rebellious, bringing armies and bandit troops. When the sky is cloudless, bright and clear. The year is good and bountiful, with seedlings thriving. If yin prevails, drought and injury arise, with locusts as the curse. Grain and beans are damaged, rice and wheat surge in price. When wind comes from *Qian*, frost harms all things. Millet becomes expensive, the people starve, and disaster befalls soldiers. When wind comes from *Kan*, winter is bitterly cold. The northern barbarians invade and plunder, capturing their chieftains in battle. When wind comes from *Gen*, all things flourish. The five grains ripen—this is a year of abundance. When wind comes from *Zhen*, Earth’s *qi* leaks excessively. Nothing comes to fruition, people worry, and spirits rejoice. When wind comes from *Xun*, the Hidden Gate brings much misfortune. Vermin breed in the wild, and vegetables fail. When wind comes from *Li*, drought harms seedlings and crops. Living things harm people, and petty men dominate. When wind comes from *Kun*, spring is often cold. In the sixth month, floods occur, and earthworks stir calamity. When wind comes from *Dui*, war arises, bringing sorrow. Nothing grows easily, and frost and drought bring suffering.\n\nOn the day of the Spring Equinox, Heavenly Impetus governs. When green clouds come from the east, the year’s affairs will know no hunger. Dusk’s cold brings much misfortune; clear skies are not auspicious. When the Bright Multitude’s wind strikes, this is a year of abundance. When wind comes from *Qian*, [text missing]. Metal and iron double in price, and human affairs are obstructed. When wind comes from *Kan*, long-term guests suffer hunger and plague. Beans and wheat [text missing], [text missing]. When wind comes from *Gen*, summer often fails to ripen. People face minor hunger, and next year’s harvest doubles. When wind comes from [text missing], [text missing]. The year is peaceful and auspicious, and the four seas are free of dust. When wind comes from *Xun*, insects breed in the wild. In the fourth month, [text missing], [text missing]. When wind comes from above, in the fifth month, floods arrive first.",

      "translated_text": "The earth trembles and mountains quake, the people starve and grow emaciated. The stars of Heavenly Assistance delve deep into the Dao and virtue. Should they wander to the *Qian* position, ruler and minister share profound joy. When they align with the *Kun* palace, treasures of pearls and jewels are bestowed. If the *Dui* palace presides, grain is prized while gold is cheap. When the *Xun* spirit takes its place, the myriad trees rejoice in glory. A hundred flowers vie in splendor, dancing through gardens and groves. Should they come to *Li* and *Zhen*, thunderclaps strike with terror. When *Gen* joins the two empresses, pregnant women grieve in sorrow. If *Kuigang* arrives in tandem, childbirth becomes fraught with peril. When the Noble One and White Tiger appear, *Chuansong* descends upon *Kan*. As the earth’s hidden treasures are revealed, gold and jade lie exposed. The stars of Heavenly Heart are the luminaries of sun and moon. When *Yi* and *Xin* meet *Qian* and *Gen*, the sun floats amid iridescent clouds. When *Bing* and *Geng* come to *Dui*, the moon gleams with radiant splendor. When *Ding* and *Gui* arrive at *Xun*, stars shimmer in the imperial court. When the Soaring Serpent and Great Unity appear, the moon’s hue turns golden. When Vermilion Bird and Great Auspicious appear, the sun’s light shines silver. When stars stream into the Dipper, the heavens open in *Kun*. When comets emerge, White Tiger resides in *Chen*. The great image of Heavenly Heart governs the myriad spirits. When Resting Gate convenes, gods and ghosts manifest their might. When Death Gate convenes, the spirits perish and lose reverence. When Wounding Gate convenes, gods and ghosts are but empty names. When Opening Gate convenes, sacrifices bring blessings. When Life Gate convenes, blessings are bestowed... When Obstructing Gate convenes, gods and ghosts conceal their forms. When Scenic Gate convenes, celestial officials make their rounds. The spirits dare not... When Startling Gate convenes, calamities befall the people. When *Kuigang* and Great Unity..., the Soaring Serpent..., ... When the Noble One and Heavenly Void appear, the might of the spirits goes unheard. When Vermilion Bird and *Chuansong* appear, the spirits’ voices are severed... When establishing temples and laying foundations, foreknow the rise and fall. When Heavenly Heart resides in *Qian*, offer half a thousand incense sticks. In the *Kun* palace, a hundred... If they come to the *Xun* position, demotion or exile follows swiftly. Beware the *Li* position, where the spirits’ mandate is not steadfast. In the *Kan* palace, sinking and drowning occur, and spirits and ghosts... Should they wander to *Gen*, a thousand years of continuity unfold. *Kun* does not endure long, nor does *Dui* remain firm. Though spirits and ghosts possess power, humans may yet prevail. I impart to you this method—bear it in mind. When spirits and ghosts harass people, gather stones in *Qian*. If the stone weighs a hundred *jin*, spirits and ghosts incur transgressions. If the stone weighs a thousand *jin*, the offense reaches the heavens. Bury the name below, and earth deities will appear. They will be bound to the nether darkness, never to return. The paths of humans and spirits diverge—this has been the eternal source. Spirits and deities, heed this: hasten to conceal yourselves.\n\nThe *Libao Juxuan* Section\nThe *Juxuan Yijing* states: When *Ren* is added to the fleeing formula, *Bing* is called the Luminous Realm, and *Geng* is named Venus. Should they meet Vermilion Bird, minor schemes yield great gains. If they align with Great Unity, joy and wine abound. When *Dengming* and Heavenly Consort appear, disputes and strife arise. When Celestial Pivot and River Chariot appear, host and guest flee. If they serve as the Day Horse, the Death Spirit accompanies them. Those injured will surely perish, and misfortune will be spoken of. If they serve as the Day Fortune, beautiful women and fine wine appear. If they ride the Hook Star, wealth is lost and lawsuits arise. When the Day Ghost is transmitted together, dreams and omens cause alarm. If they serve as the Day Tomb, mourning garments are worn. When the Noble One is in governance, official matters entangle. If the Straight Talisman is added, wrongful death in prison follows. *Yi* is named Azure Dragon, and *Xin* is called White Tiger. When the Day Fortune joins them, marriages should be arranged. When the Hook Star is at the center, earth cannot be moved. Deaths among the people bring misfortune to ancestors. When the Victorious Serpent is at the center, wealth is seized. The same applies to the Day Breaker—afflictions of the eyes follow. When Dark Warrior and *Dengming* appear, lost items are hard to find. If they encounter Void, objects do not leave the door. The same applies to Heavenly Void—things remain as they are. When Moon Loathing and Heavenly Ghost appear, a hundred strange phenomena manifest. False thunder and lightning, clanging metal and wailing cauldrons. *Gui* is named Dark Warrior, and *Ding* is called Vermilion Bird. When the Three Punishments are at the center, documents are lost. When the Day Horse is transmitted together, documents are summoned to court. When the Day Breaker is transmitted together, documents are soiled. If they align with the Day Fortune, documents... When the Noble One is in governance, imperial favor and official emoluments follow. When Azure Dragon and Great Constancy appear, civil and military arts, medicine, and divination prosper. All matters... When Celestial Pivot and River Chariot appear, no day is fit for travel. If White Tiger is further encountered, houses and pavilions collapse repeatedly. When Heavenly Consort..., all manner of afflictions turn wealth and grain to ash. When Hook Star and Six Harmonies appear, Great Unity and *Chuansong* transmit together. The Four Generals... When *Jia* is named Heavenly Fortune and *Bing* is named Heavenly Virtue, if the Day Fortune aligns with them, the myriad spirits are subdued... Beware the Day Breaker, Day Ghost, and Day Killer. Success turns to failure, gaining nine but losing eight. When the Soaring Serpent and White Tiger appear... When *Congkui* and *Chuansong* appear, all matters are doubled. When Hook Star and Heavenly Consort appear, undertakings are hard to resolve. When Great Unity and Vermilion Bird appear, thieves and bandits cannot be tolerated. When the Moon Breaker and Moon Loathing appear, lawsuits assail repeatedly. When Azure Dragon and Great Constancy appear, official rank is exalted. It is also fitting to pursue profit—all matters are auspicious. When *Gongcao* and Vermilion Bird appear, promotions and honors flourish. *Geng* is named Venus, and *Gui* is called Dark Warrior. If they meet the Victorious Serpent, boats suffer drowning. Money and goods are swindled away, and possessions lose their owner. When White Tiger and *Chuansong* appear, travelers encounter tigers. When the Moon Breaker and Moon Void appear, wine and feasting are abundant. When the Moon Punishment and Moon Killer appear, wealth and profit are not lost. When the Day Ghost and Day Horse appear, one rushes east and west. Even more feared is their presence at the gate—death and misfortune befall. When *Si* serves as Hook Star and *Geng* arrives together, *Dengming* and *Congkui* entangle in misfortune. If they align with White Tiger, sudden illness leads to madness. When the Victorious Serpent and Heavenly Void appear, human affairs flee and hide. When River Chariot and Six Harmonies appear, fire and candles are extinguished. When Great Yin and Heavenly Consort appear, great fame is achieved. When the Metal Spirit and Plundering Killer appear, authority is instead wielded. When they transmit together internally with *Chuansong*, illness renders speech difficult.",

When Merit Officer and Heavenly Consort appear, with Great Yin and *Congkui*, young monks visit the door, and Daoist priests offer tea. If *Congkui* meets the Noble One, or else Victorious Light, men suffer windstroke, not immediately falling into madness. Wind Earl and Rain Master bring ceaseless wind and rain. When *Bing* serves as Fire Star, the Direct Spirit is hard to suppress. When Post Horse and Great Unity appear, one encounters officials and is imprisoned. When Vermilion Bird and Soaring Serpent appear, poisoned food is lamentable. When *Dengming* and Divine Marshal appear, their schemes [remain unclear].\n\nWhen Death Spirit and Death Qi appear, yang persons die or are matched in misfortune.

When Returning Chant and Hidden Chant appear, disputes turn ugly. When Heavenly Spirit and Two Consorts appear, women are guarded by men. When Six Harmonies and Great Yin appear, men flee and women escape. When the Hour Stem overcomes the Day Stem, Dark Warrior brings loss. If it meets Void, two matters merge into one. If further paired with Victorious Light, many worries arise. When Serpent and Tiger coexist, killing and terror strike. Know the Three, avoid the Five—no obstacles in the eight directions. When the Direct Envoy arrives at *Zhen*, this is the Third. When the Direct Envoy enters *Kun*, this is the Fifth. Five is the Death Gate, yet it delights in Victorious Light. When Vermilion Bird and Victorious Serpent appear, with Great Unity in the same place, the great are uplifted, and the petty admire. Three is the Land of Life—do not meet White Tiger. When Post Horse and *Congkui* appear, with Great Yin in attendance, life turns to death, fortune reverses to bitter misfortune. If one hears crows cawing, swiftly observe the Scenic Gate. The one before the Direct Spirit brings coercion and urgency. Evil men coerce and deceive, demanding money. The second ahead brings disputes, the third marriage. Otherwise, lawsuits and clamorous arguments fill the gate. The fourth ahead brings brawls, competing for wealth. The one behind the Direct Spirit involves women. The second behind brings fraud and deceit, with lewdness and adultery sprouting. The third behind brings loss, clothing and [text unclear] vanish.

If *Congkui* is below, widows spread rumors. If a fortunate general appears above, wine and food are offered in welcome. If Post Horse is below, people come seeking items.

If Great Fortune is below, relatives and friends reunite. If Divine Marshal is below, [text unclear]. If *Dengming* is below, officials demand documents. One must also listen to sounds, noting from which direction they come. Use this to divine [text unclear]. [Text unclear] When strange birds cry, this judgment is never false.\n\nThe secret principles of the Nine Escapes of Communing with Spirits:\nHeavenly Escape is profound and mysterious—one meets worthy persons.

When Day Breaker is within, speak not of a hundred affairs. When Day Ghost is within, ten thousand matters entangle. When Day Union is within, criminals meet disaster.
