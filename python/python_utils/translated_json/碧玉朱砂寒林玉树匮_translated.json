  "full_translation": "*The Jade Casket of Cinnabar and Frosted Trees of the Cold Forest*\n*Title:* *The Jade Casket of Cinnabar and Frosted Trees of the Cold Forest*\n*Author:* Chen the Great Master of the Song Dynasty\n*Volume:* One\n*Source Text:* *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* Section, *Miscellaneous Arts* Category\n\n*The Jade Casket of Cinnabar and Frosted Trees of the Cold Forest*\n*Recorded by Chen the Great Master of Western Shu*\n\nNow, the Dragon and Tiger are the root of lead and mercury. When these two substances interact, transformations arise. Lead resides in water, mercury in fire; though mercury and lead share a single origin, the immortal’s realm lies but a footstep away. Yet if one forcibly refines cinnabar with wine and vinegar, thousands upon thousands of times, it will dissipate into smoke. This illustrates that lead and mercury are of one body.\n\nWhen lead and mercury unite, no visible sign appears; when fire is subdued with sulfur, the flame subsides. The Way of generation begins with the essence and blood of father and mother, uniting to conceive life. Thus, when lead and mercury merge, Dragon and Tiger take form. Moreover, without the work of lead and mercury, cinnabar cannot stabilize its qi. It relies entirely on the casket of lead and mercury to restrain the flame, preventing any loss.\n\nCinnabar yields mercury, yet is slain by mercury—this is the mystery within the mystery.\n\nA poem says:\n*When lead and mercury unite, the sacred embryo forms,*\n*Within the sacred embryo, an infant child takes form.*\n*This infant is the treasure hidden in lead—*\n*Who would believe such a child could be nurtured therein?*\n\nThus, when fire-subdued cinnabar is slain by *pi*, it dies. Another saying goes: *Cinnabar is subdued by lead, yet perfected by sulfur.* This is called: *If you wish mercury to die, first let mercury die.* It is also said: *In death by analogy, it does not depart from its parents.* And again: *When Dragon and Tiger are forged together, it is called true lead.* To use lead alone, without union, is to treat it as a stubborn thing, devoid of the Way of transformation.\n\nDragon-mercury and Tiger-lead, yin and yang in mutual resonance, essence and qi intermingling to conceive—thus the Mysterious Pass is formed.\n\nA poem says:\n*True lead, wondrous and great, is the head of the Great Elixir,*\n*Mercury unites with Metal Lord, their transformation profound.*\n*Through their union, the numinous mechanism yields five hues,*\n*As Dragon sings and Tiger roars, the old adept refines.*\n\nAmong the four spirits, only true mercury can subdue lead. The yang Tiger and yin Dragon—thus mercury becomes lead. This is the Way of mother and child: the Metal Lord generates the Tiger’s flesh, while mercury strengthens the lead’s sinews and bones.\n\nA poem says:\n*Depart from lead, leave the mother, and wholly enter the sacred,*\n*Entering the sacred, transcending the mundane—mystery upon mystery.*\n*Nurture cinnabar to subdue fire,*\n*And you shall witness mercury turn dry.*\n\nWhen mercury dries, you emerge into the realm of immortals—who says immortals possess a separate elixir? Recognize the true lead and the mechanism of transformation, and you shall easily enter the Mysterious Pass.\n\n**Method:**\nTake half a catty of silver-lead, melt it in a crucible, then add lime, white glue, and *xiangpo*, skimming off impurities several times to obtain the refined portion. Next, mix with mulberry bark and stir-fry until clean. Take two-thirds of the lead and melt it with mercury, then gradually sprinkle in powdered *nanxing*, stirring with a willow branch until it turns to powder. Wash with water to remove the medicinal residue, then blend with eight auxiliary ingredients. Stir-fry again for half a day before sealing it into a casket.\n\nA poem says:\n*Dragon and Tiger unite in harmony,*\n*Yin and yang in resonance, their joy redoubled.*\n\nRooted in the primordial unity, it yet enters the sacred realm, leaving the Dragon’s Slope.\n\n**Eight Auxiliary Ingredients:**\n- *Pengsha* (borax) – 1 *liang*\n- *Paosha* (processed cinnabar) – 1 *liang*\n- *Shizhonghuang* (yellow essence within stone) – 1 *liang*\n- *Xuanmushi* (Mysterious Mother Stone) – 1 *liang*\n- *Siliu* (dead sulfur) – 5 *qian* and a half\n- *Shidan* (chalcanthite) – 5 *qian* and a half\n- *Xiaoshi* (saltpeter) – 5 *qian* and a half\n- *Qingguan* (green vitriol) – 5 *qian* and a half\n\nTo this, add 1 *liang* and a half of cinnabar. Line the casket with gold foil, seal the preceding medicinals within, and nurture until the cinnabar turns emerald. Then replace it with 1 *liang* and a half of fresh cinnabar, and nurture again under the same fire regimen. In total, obtain three *liang* of \"dead cinnabar.\" Remove the casket’s medicinals to prepare a separate elixir base. This is the method for parting lead from its mother to form a treasure.\n\nA poem says:\n*The great Dao of yin and yang, a wondrous transmission,*\n*Requires only mercury and black lead.*\n*Neither harms the cinnabar’s body nor the lead,*\n*This method is mystery within mystery, profound beyond measure.*\n*Should one recognize the true Dragon and Tiger,*\n*Transformation and success shall appear before one’s eyes.*\n*I laugh at those whose hair has turned snow-white,*\n*Unknowing of the wondrous Dao, their words mere empty talk.*\n\nTake the three *liang* of subdued cinnabar and grind it into a casket. Then nurture two *liang* of raw cinnabar, coating it with honey and willow powder before placing it into the casket of dead cinnabar. Nurture for seven days, then increase the fire for one firing. When opened, the cinnabar will be white.\n\nA poem says:\n*The two qi, clinging to lead, coalesce and form,*\n*Further congealing in the crucible’s pristine essence.*\n*If the initial nurturing lacks sufficient force,*\n*Do not let the flame burn too fiercely, lest the power fail to ascend.*\n\nTake the cinnabar nurtured thrice, totaling five *liang*, and grind it into a casket. Then nurture three *liang* of raw cinnabar, using *huangbo*, *huangqin*, bean powder, and honey as the coating medicine. Seal it within the cinnabar casket and nurture for a full three days, firing once. The cinnabar will turn white—hence called \"undissolving white snow.\"\n\nA poem says:\n*Thrice transformed, the Dragon’s qi ascends higher,*\n*Yet it scorns its primordial ancestor as mere worldly dust.*\n*When the cinnabar’s work is done and it is smelted into liquid,*\n*Stir it into the furnace—snow that will not melt.*\n\nTake the thrice-transformed Dragon’s cinnabar, now totaling eight *liang*, and grind it into powder to prepare a casket for nurturing treasures and achieving longevity. All manner of *jinmusha* (gold mother cinnabar), *musha* (mother cinnabar), *lingsha* (spirit cinnabar), *zhusha* (cinnabar), *sanhuang* (three yellows), and *fenghuang* (powdery frost) may be nurtured within, and the Dao of transformation is complete. It rests upon the practitioner’s intent, like jade trees in a wintry forest. All things that live must die—hence the name \"wintry forest.\"\n\n**Method:**\nPlace the casket’s medicinals into a sealed cavity. Use one *liang* of raw mercury, boiled with a cup of vinegar, then pour it into the cavity and seal for three days. When opened, mercury sprouts one or two *cun* long will have grown. Harvest them gradually for any desired transformation or transmutation.\n\nA poem says:\n*Subdued cinnabar makes an earthly immortal,*\n*Yet the cinnabar must be subdued by true lead.*\n*To discard lead and cinnabar is still mistaken—*\n*Parting from the mother and removing lead is the surging spring.*\n\nTake the preceding eight *liang* of cinnabar powder, separate it with a barrier, and cover it with finely ground *yunmu* (mica) and *huashi* (talc). Seal tightly and nurture with fire for three days. When opened, the cinnabar will be white. Remove the previous medicinals, and use the *yunmu* and *huashi* to form a casket with the cinnabar. Place it into a sealed container, layering one *liang* of fine *xinshi* (arsenic) wrapped in Kunlun paper over the cinnabar powder, then cover with *yunmu* stone and tamp firmly. Seal and nurture for three days. When opened, the resulting *pi* (arsenic compound) can transmute and subdue base metals into vessels, benefiting future generations. If used with mercury sprouts for transmutation, the effect is even more wondrous.\n\nTake the preceding casket, tamp it firmly into a sealed container, and separate it with vinegar-moistened buckwheat ash. Place this on top as a cover, seal, and nurture for three days. When opened, the color will revert to red. Then take one *liang* of bright *xionghuang* (realgar), refine it through firing, and boil it with the preceding medicinals. Tamp firmly, seal, and nurture for three days. When opened, the medicinals will be entirely yellow—this is the \"Yellow Sprout,\" which, when combined with mercury, can transmute into gold.\n\nA poem says:\n*The Seven-Return Elixir, though small in measure,*\n*Can transmute yellow and white into treasures without distinction.*\n*Jade trees in a jeweled forest bloom in rivalry,*\n*Transmuting the mundane—no error shall befall.*\n\nGrind the cinnabar finely and prepare it into a casket, separated by a barrier. Place the original casket of lead, mercury, and cinnabar medicinals on top, ensuring it is firmly packed. Within the cinnabar casket, nurture three *liang* of raw cinnabar, seal, and nurture for seven days. When opened, the cinnabar will have turned red—hence called the \"Seven-Return Longevity Transformation.\" After nurturing cinnabar seven times, it becomes intensely red, and the elixir’s essence is complete. Thus, it is called the \"Returned Elixir,\" and at this stage, it is fully realized. Initially, its color was emerald, resembling the mother; later, it turned white, resembling the father; after seven nurturings, it returns to red, fully completing the seven returns to the true. Hence, it is called \"returning to the primordial.\"\n\nThen take two *liang* of superior *cihuang* (orpiment), refine it through boiling, line it with gold foil, wrap it in inked paper, and place it into the Seven-Return casket. Seal tightly and nurture with fire for three days. When opened, it can be combined with mercury sprouts to transmute *geng* (metal) into a treasure for the world.\n\n**Furnace Method:**\nPlace white salt beneath the crucible. Place the mercury sprouts inside, then cover with *guan* (a vessel lid). Even if the vessel cracks, the mercury will not escape—no sealing medicinal is needed. Remember this carefully and treasure it.\n\n**Intoxicating Gold Pool:**\n- *Ruxiang* (frankincense) – 2 *qian*\n- *Pengsha* (borax) – 1 *qian*\n- *Baifan* (white alum) – 3 *qian*\n- *Paosha* (processed cinnabar) – 5 *qian*\n\nDivide the above into eight portions. For each *liang* of metal to be transmuted, use one *qian* of the medicinal. Combine with silver in a crucible, melt into liquid, then pour into a mold. When cooled, strike to remove the medicinal residue. The resulting metal will be soft, pure, and flawless, its excellence beyond words.\n\nThis red method originates from Mount Qingcheng in Shu, transmitted by Master Pu. It was obtained by Fan Shusou of the West Lake Daoist Abbey in Hangzhou—a proven secret formula.\n\n**First Method: Nurturing *Geng* Cinnabar in a Jasper Cinnabar Casket**\nTake one *jin* of silver-lead, stir-fry with mulberry bark until white, leaving ten *liang*. Melt it into liquid. Prepare fifty packets of ash, each grasped with tongs and dipped into the liquid. Pour in three *liang* of mercury, then quickly withdraw the tongs into the cold ash, stirring until it turns to powder. Sift finely. Repeat the process with the remaining lead, adding two *liang* of mercury, and stir rapidly into liquid. Wash with water to remove the ash, then stir-fry the medicinals to prepare a casket for subduing sulfur—use five *qian* of five-colored sulfur.\n\n**Four *qian* of processed *yunü* stone and three *qian* of blasted [mineral], ground together into fine powder, are placed into a large crucible. Gradually add the medicinals while stir-frying the previously prepared lead-mercury cinnabar until, after one day, it solidifies into a casket.**\n\n**Second Method: Refining and Forging**\nTake three *liang* of bright, coarse cinnabar and subdue the sulfur by boiling it in honey until it adheres. Then wrap each piece in gold foil and place it into one *jin* of the aforementioned lead-mercury medicinal. Nurture with gentle fire for seven days. Upon removal, the cinnabar will have entirely transformed into a golden body, most delightful to behold. Grind this cinnabar into a casket and proceed with the subsequent nurturing process.\n\n**Third Method: The Sagely Transmutation of the Embryo**\nPrepare a casket from three *liang* of cinnabar. Nurture one *liang* of coarse cinnabar, subduing the sulfur so it adheres, then wrap it in gold foil. Seal it within the casket and nurture for a full ten days, then refine with intense fire. Upon cooling, grind it as before. Nurture another one *liang* and two *qian* of coarse cinnabar, adhering it as described. Continue nurturing until half a *jin* is reached, totaling fifty days, then grind and subdue the fire uniformly.\n\n**Fourth Method: Nurturing *Fen Shuang***\nTake two *liang* of fine *fen shuang* and combine it with the previous *geng* cinnabar casket medicinal, grinding them together into a casket. Separately nurture one *liang* of hard, imported *fen shuang*, kneading it with refined honey into pills. Wrap these in ink-dyed paper and place them at the center of the *geng* powder casket, sealing and nurturing for seven days. Upon cooling, remove the subdued powder, or use it as an adherent for the subsequent *geng* mother cinnabar. When applied for transmutation and bone-refining, its efficacy is wondrously profound.\n\n**Fifth Method: Congealing *Geng* Mother Cinnabar**\nTake three *liang* of cinnabar mercury and six *qian* of *geng* mother, forming them into eight pieces of cinnabar grains. Suspend and boil them for a day and night in a solution of fermented water, alum, lime, soapberry ash, and *shechuangzi*, in equal parts. Remove and apply the tight-cinnabar method: use three *liang* of *kezhi* powder, first spreading one *liang* at the bottom of a crucible. Place the wrapped *geng* cinnabar at the center, then cover it with the remaining *kezhi* powder. Place it in the firing chamber until thick smoke rises, then sprinkle the remaining *kezhi* powder on top until exhausted. Upon cooling, test the cinnabar’s hardness—if a blade cannot penetrate, it is ready for the casket. If not firm enough, repeat the process. After the previous nurturing, take the remaining *fen shuang* and adhere it. Prepare a large container, grind the tight cinnabar within, and embed the *geng* cinnabar inside. Form the leftover *fen shuang* (half a *liang*) into pellets, mix intimately with five *qian* of raw cinnabar, and adhere it. Then subdue the sulfur powder, wrap it in gold foil, and arrange this powder at the center of the casket, with the *geng* cinnabar surrounding it. Seal tightly and place it in the pool furnace, nurturing with fire for seven days, then two more days—nine days in total. Refine it once in the furnace. Upon cooling, the *geng* cinnabar will have become a treasure.\n\nWhen the smoke melts without breaking, the color reaches full saturation. If refining further, follow the previous method to congeal the cinnabar and place it in the casket. Then nurture half a *liang* of inverted cinnabar externally, add it to the casket, and grind finely, cultivating it in stages. Use half a *liang* of *fen shuang*, or increase it to one *liang*, reserving it as *geng-zi* for adhering. For instance, when adding and nurturing cinnabar, after accumulating a year’s work, it may be divided into two caskets—this is called \"Spring of Long Life\" or \"Seed Fire Field,\" an unending marvel of the Dao.\n\nIf no further substance is to be nurtured, seal the casket as prescribed and bury it in a pit of ash within the furnace, maintaining a gentle, unceasing fire. Only then will yin qi not arise, and the casket will become thoroughly numinous. The transformations are manifold, and the effects varied—this is called \"nurturing the female and male,\" and all transmutations may be achieved thereby.\n\nOnly those with understanding can fathom this; thus, one grasps the great workings of creation. This method was originally transmitted by the ancients to Wang Yuanzhong of the White Cloud Elder’s household in Taiyuan, a guarded treasure to prevent misleading later generations. The Lu Chancellor’s residence in Bianliang obtained it, passing it to the Qian household, where hands-on practice confirmed its efficacy—it is not transmitted to those without virtue.\n\nI later acquired it in the capital’s government office, keeping it secret. It comprises three stages of lead and mercury, surpassing all others in marvel—truly the foremost technique under heaven. Originally received from the residence of Minister Wei Shusou and the capital’s chancellor’s office, its essence and application follow a single principle, embodying the true scripture of the Prince of Huainan. Within the profound lies the profounder, within the wondrous lies the more wondrous—trust it without doubt. Guard it well; be warned, be warned.\n\nThe *Casket of Azure Jade, Cinnabar, Cold Forest, and Jade Tree* concludes.",

This is the method for parting lead from its mother to form a treasure.\n\nA poem says:\n*The great Dao of yin and yang, a wondrous transmission,*\n*Requires only mercury and black lead.*\n*Neither harms the cinnabar’s body nor the lead,*\n*This method is mystery within mystery, profound beyond measure.*\n*Should one recognize the true Dragon and Tiger,*\n*Transformation and success shall appear before one’s eyes.*\n*I laugh at those whose hair has turned snow-white,*\n*Unknowing of the wondrous Dao, their words mere empty talk.*\n\nTake the three *liang* of subdued cinnabar and grind it into a casket. Then nurture two *liang* of raw cinnabar, coating it with honey and willow powder before placing it into the casket of dead cinnabar. Nurture for seven days, then increase the fire for one firing. When opened, the cinnabar will be white.\n\nA poem says:\n*The two qi, clinging to lead, coalesce and form,*\n*Further congealing in the crucible’s pristine essence.*\n*If the initial nurturing lacks sufficient force,*\n*Do not let the flame burn too fiercely, lest the power fail to ascend.*\n\nTake the cinnabar nurtured thrice, totaling five *liang*, and grind it into a casket. Then nurture three *liang* of raw cinnabar, using *huangbo*, *huangqin*, bean powder, and honey as the coating medicine. Seal it within the cinnabar casket and nurture for a full three days, firing once. The cinnabar will turn white—hence called \"undissolving white snow.\"\n\nA poem says:\n*Thrice transformed, the Dragon’s qi ascends higher,*\n*Yet it scorns its primordial ancestor as mere worldly dust.*\n*When the cinnabar’s work is done and it is smelted into liquid,*\n*Stir it into the furnace—snow that will not melt.*\n\nTake the thrice-transformed Dragon’s cinnabar, now totaling eight *liang*, and grind it into powder to prepare a casket for nurturing treasures and achieving longevity. All manner of *jinmusha* (gold mother cinnabar), *musha* (mother cinnabar), *lingsha* (spirit cinnabar), *zhusha* (cinnabar), *sanhuang* (three yellows), and *fenghuang* (powdery frost) may be nurtured within, and the Dao of transformation is complete. It rests upon the practitioner’s intent, like jade trees in a wintry forest. All things that live must die—hence the name \"wintry forest.\"\n\n**Method:**\nPlace the casket’s medicinals into a sealed cavity. Use one *liang* of raw mercury, boiled with a cup of vinegar, then pour it into the cavity and seal for three days. When opened, mercury sprouts one or two *cun* long will have grown. Harvest them gradually for any desired transformation or transmutation.\n\nA poem says:\n*Subdued cinnabar makes an earthly immortal,*\n*Yet the cinnabar must be subdued by true lead.*\n*To discard lead and cinnabar is still mistaken—*\n*Parting from the mother and removing lead is the surging spring.*\n\nTake the preceding eight *liang* of cinnabar powder, separate it with a barrier, and cover it with finely ground *yunmu* (mica) and *huashi* (talc). Seal tightly and nurture with fire for three days. When opened, the cinnabar will be white. Remove the previous medicinals, and use the *yunmu* and *huashi* to form a casket with the cinnabar. Place it into a sealed container, layering one *liang* of fine *xinshi* (arsenic) wrapped in Kunlun paper over the cinnabar powder, then cover with *yunmu* stone and tamp firmly. Seal and nurture for three days. When opened, the resulting *pi* (arsenic compound) can transmute and subdue base metals into vessels, benefiting future generations. If used with mercury sprouts for transmutation, the effect is even more wondrous.\n\nTake the preceding casket, tamp it firmly into a sealed container, and separate it with vinegar-moistened buckwheat ash. Place this on top as a cover, seal, and nurture for three days. When opened, the color will revert to red. Then take one *liang* of bright *xionghuang* (realgar), refine it through firing, and boil it with the preceding medicinals. Tamp firmly, seal, and nurture for three days. When opened, the medicinals will be entirely yellow—this is the \"Yellow Sprout,\" which, when combined with mercury, can transmute into gold.\n\nA poem says:\n*The Seven-Return Elixir, though small in measure,*\n*Can transmute yellow and white into treasures without distinction.*\n*Jade trees in a jeweled forest bloom in rivalry,*\n*Transmuting the mundane—no error shall befall.*\n\nGrind the cinnabar finely and prepare it into a casket, separated by a barrier. Place the original casket of lead, mercury, and cinnabar medicinals on top, ensuring it is firmly packed. Within the cinnabar casket, nurture three *liang* of raw cinnabar, seal, and nurture for seven days. When opened, the cinnabar will have turned red—hence called the \"Seven-Return Longevity Transformation.\" After nurturing cinnabar seven times, it becomes intensely red, and the elixir’s essence is complete. Thus, it is called the \"Returned Elixir,\" and at this stage, it is fully realized. Initially, its color was emerald, resembling the mother; later, it turned white, resembling the father; after seven nurturings, it returns to red, fully completing the seven returns to the true. Hence, it is called \"returning to the primordial.\"\n\nThen take two *liang* of superior *cihuang* (orpiment), refine it through boiling, line it with gold foil, wrap it in inked paper, and place it into the Seven-Return casket. Seal tightly and nurture with fire for three days. When opened, it can be combined with mercury sprouts to transmute *geng* (metal) into a treasure for the world.\n\n**Furnace Method:**\nPlace white salt beneath the crucible. Place the mercury sprouts inside, then cover with *guan* (a vessel lid). Even if the vessel cracks, the mercury will not escape—no sealing medicinal is needed. Remember this carefully and treasure it.\n\n**Intoxicating Gold Pool:**\n- *Ruxiang* (frankincense) – 2 *qian*\n- *Pengsha* (borax) – 1 *qian*\n- *Baifan* (white alum) – 3 *qian*\n- *Paosha* (processed cinnabar) – 5 *qian*\n\nDivide the above into eight portions. For each *liang* of metal to be transmuted, use one *qian* of the medicinal. Combine with silver in a crucible, melt into liquid, then pour into a mold. When cooled, strike to remove the medicinal residue. The resulting metal will be soft, pure, and flawless, its excellence beyond words.\n\nThis red method originates from Mount Qingcheng in Shu, transmitted by Master Pu. It was obtained by Fan Shusou of the West Lake Daoist Abbey in Hangzhou—a proven secret formula.\n\n**First Method: Nurturing *Geng* Cinnabar in a Jasper Cinnabar Casket**\nTake one *jin* of silver-lead, stir-fry with mulberry bark until white, leaving ten *liang*. Melt it into liquid. Prepare fifty packets of ash, each grasped with tongs and dipped into the liquid. Pour in three *liang* of mercury, then quickly withdraw the tongs into the cold ash, stirring until it turns to powder. Sift finely. Repeat the process with the remaining lead, adding two *liang* of mercury, and stir rapidly into liquid. Wash with water to remove the ash, then stir-fry the medicinals to prepare a casket for subduing sulfur—use five *qian* of five-colored sulfur.",

Take two-thirds of the lead and melt it with mercury, then gradually sprinkle in powdered *nanxing*, stirring with a willow branch until it turns to powder.

Gradually add the medicinals while stir-frying the previously prepared lead-mercury cinnabar until, after one day, it solidifies into a casket.**\n\n**Second Method: Refining and Forging**\nTake three *liang* of bright, coarse cinnabar and subdue the sulfur by boiling it in honey until it adheres. Then wrap each piece in gold foil and place it into one *jin* of the aforementioned lead-mercury medicinal. Nurture with gentle fire for seven days. Upon removal, the cinnabar will have entirely transformed into a golden body, most delightful to behold. Grind this cinnabar into a casket and proceed with the subsequent nurturing process.\n\n**Third Method: The Sagely Transmutation of the Embryo**\nPrepare a casket from three *liang* of cinnabar. Nurture one *liang* of coarse cinnabar, subduing the sulfur so it adheres, then wrap it in gold foil. Seal it within the casket and nurture for a full ten days, then refine with intense fire. Upon cooling, grind it as before. Nurture another one *liang* and two *qian* of coarse cinnabar, adhering it as described. Continue nurturing until half a *jin* is reached, totaling fifty days, then grind and subdue the fire uniformly.\n\n**Fourth Method: Nurturing *Fen Shuang***\nTake two *liang* of fine *fen shuang* and combine it with the previous *geng* cinnabar casket medicinal, grinding them together into a casket. Separately nurture one *liang* of hard, imported *fen shuang*, kneading it with refined honey into pills. Wrap these in ink-dyed paper and place them at the center of the *geng* powder casket, sealing and nurturing for seven days. Upon cooling, remove the subdued powder, or use it as an adherent for the subsequent *geng* mother cinnabar. When applied for transmutation and bone-refining, its efficacy is wondrously profound.\n\n**Fifth Method: Congealing *Geng* Mother Cinnabar**\nTake three *liang* of cinnabar mercury and six *qian* of *geng* mother, forming them into eight pieces of cinnabar grains. Suspend and boil them for a day and night in a solution of fermented water, alum, lime, soapberry ash, and *shechuangzi*, in equal parts. Remove and apply the tight-cinnabar method: use three *liang* of *kezhi* powder, first spreading one *liang* at the bottom of a crucible. Place the wrapped *geng* cinnabar at the center, then cover it with the remaining *kezhi* powder. Place it in the firing chamber until thick smoke rises, then sprinkle the remaining *kezhi* powder on top until exhausted. Upon cooling, test the cinnabar’s hardness—if a blade cannot penetrate, it is ready for the casket. If not firm enough, repeat the process. After the previous nurturing, take the remaining *fen shuang* and adhere it. Prepare a large container, grind the tight cinnabar within, and embed the *geng* cinnabar inside. Form the leftover *fen shuang* (half a *liang*) into pellets, mix intimately with five *qian* of raw cinnabar, and adhere it. Then subdue the sulfur powder, wrap it in gold foil, and arrange this powder at the center of the casket, with the *geng* cinnabar surrounding it. Seal tightly and place it in the pool furnace, nurturing with fire for seven days, then two more days—nine days in total. Refine it once in the furnace.

Then nurture half a *liang* of inverted cinnabar externally, add it to the casket, and grind finely, cultivating it in stages. Use half a *liang* of *fen shuang*, or increase it to one *liang*, reserving it as *geng-zi* for adhering. For instance, when adding and nurturing cinnabar, after accumulating a year’s work, it may be divided into two caskets—this is called \"Spring of Long Life\" or \"Seed Fire Field,\" an unending marvel of the Dao.\n\nIf no further substance is to be nurtured, seal the casket as prescribed and bury it in a pit of ash within the furnace, maintaining a gentle, unceasing fire. Only then will yin qi not arise, and the casket will become thoroughly numinous. The transformations are manifold, and the effects varied—this is called \"nurturing the female and male,\" and all transmutations may be achieved thereby.\n\nOnly those with understanding can fathom this; thus, one grasps the great workings of creation. This method was originally transmitted by the ancients to Wang Yuanzhong of the White Cloud Elder’s household in Taiyuan, a guarded treasure to prevent misleading later generations. The Lu Chancellor’s residence in Bianliang obtained it, passing it to the Qian household, where hands-on practice confirmed its efficacy—it is not transmitted to those without virtue.\n\nI later acquired it in the capital’s government office, keeping it secret. It comprises three stages of lead and mercury, surpassing all others in marvel—truly the foremost technique under heaven. Originally received from the residence of Minister Wei Shusou and the capital’s chancellor’s office, its essence and application follow a single principle, embodying the true scripture of the Prince of Huainan.
