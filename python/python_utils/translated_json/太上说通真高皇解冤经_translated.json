Attributed to the Supreme Lord Lao, who reveals to the Perfected One of Vast Trust the method for delivering the starving ghosts and destitute souls of hell. One fascicle. Source text: *Wanli Continuation of the Daoist Canon*.)\n\n---\n\nAt that time, the Most High Dao Lord, together with the assembly of sacred hosts, was seated beneath the Eight Auspicious Grove and within the Seven-Treasure Terrace, arrayed in solemn dignity. Expounding the essentials of the Dao, they sat in serene silence, like the Jade Capital Mountain. Radiating nine-colored luminous light, they illumined the Hell of Blessed Halls. There, they beheld within the Blessed Halls virtuous men and women, dwelling in joy and effortless ease, carefree and at liberty. Yet again, they saw in the various hells the starving ghosts and destitute souls, enduring ceaseless torment day and night. Bereft of human form, their five limbs decayed and broken, they fed on raging flames and drank molten bronze. Their feet trod upon knife mountains, their bodies bore iron staves, their entire forms streamed with blood, and their mournful wails pierced the heavens.\n\nThen, from the assembly arose a Perfected One named Vast Trust. Rising from his seat, he bowed deeply and advanced, addressing the Heavenly Worthy: \"I humbly inquire—what transgressions did these destitute souls commit in life to suffer such torment?\"\n\nThe Lord Lao replied: \"Those who endure these torments, in their earthly existence, failed to revere the Three Treasures, defied the principles of the divine, committed the ten evils and five rebellions, were disloyal and unkind, uncompassionate and unfilial. They harmed living beings, slaughtered creatures, and when their fortune was exhausted and their lifespan ended, they were condemned to this suffering.\"\n\nThereupon, the Perfected One of Vast Trust, moved by compassion, sought to deliver them. He entreated the wondrous power and majestic radiance of the Dao to permit their liberation. The Dao Lord, in his mercy, bestowed golden words and broadly established the essential methods. For the sake of all beings, he expounded this scripture, titled *Resolving Grievances and Delivering from Sin*, to circulate in the world and benefit both the living and the dead.\n\nIf there are good men and faithful women who, with single-minded devotion, enter a quiet chamber, maintain purification, burn incense, and perform the Daoist rites in the six periods of the day, reciting this scripture with focused intention, I shall, in accordance with their wishes, protect and bless them. Thus, their karmic adversaries from past lives shall ascend through blessings and transcendence, and the suffering souls in the netherworld shall each attain liberation and ascent.\n\nThe Perfected One of Vast Trust rejoiced, bowed again, and offered this hymn of praise:\n\n*How mighty is the Great Dao Lord,*\n*Whose boundless merit ever prevails.*\n*Like a vessel crossing the sea of birth and death,*\n*He delivers and uplifts beyond Fengdu’s bounds.*\n*Karmic debts no longer meet,*\n*Blessings commune with the unseen.*\n*Who can fathom the workings of the divine?*\n*How could praise ever suffice?*\n\nAt that time, the Perfected One of Vast Trust and the assembled hosts, having heard the scripture in full, each bowed in reverence and took refuge, faithfully receiving and upholding its teachings.\n\nHere ends *The Supreme Lord Expounds the Scripture of Universal Perfection and Lofty Sovereign for Resolving Grievances*.",
