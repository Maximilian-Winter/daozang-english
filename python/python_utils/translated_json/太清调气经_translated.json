  "full_translation": "*The Supreme Clarity Scripture on Qi Regulation*\n\nThe *Scripture of the Immortals* states: At midnight (the hour of *zi*), ingest ninety-nine times eighty-one; at cockcrow, eighty-eight times sixty-four; at sunrise, sixty-six times thirty-six; at breakfast time, fifty-five times twenty-five; and at mid-morning, forty-four times sixteen.\n\nThe foregoing method has been transmitted among common folk and in old scriptures, yet those who practice it idly waste years in vain toil, enduring hardship without result, and in time suffer harm instead. This arises from failing to ingest the primordial *qi* and not recognizing the deep root. Such practices are widespread, yet prolonged adherence yields no verification, leaving the spirit exhausted and *qi* withered. Those who yearn for the Dao thus squander their lives, and in their hesitation, they forfeit their prime years—how lamentable! Such misguided paths must not be followed.\n\nAnother old scripture describes a method of abruptly fasting and ingesting *qi*, counting twelve double-hours in a day and night, with five hundred and forty swallows, repeating this cycle without end. Yet in one’s robust years, one is ensnared by desires and profit, unaware of the upright *qi*, let alone contemplating nurturance, calming the mind, or settling the spirit. By the time one’s years wane and the five viscera are already impaired, if one does not gradually cultivate and replenish but suddenly ceases eating, the primordial *qi* remains unfilled while ordinary sustenance is cut off. With neither sustaining the other, peril and demise follow, and the wish to preserve the body becomes unattainable.\n\nIt is further said that the measure lies in the number of swallows, and success in feeling sated. Yet when one first ingests *qi*, only after a hundred days does a slight passage open, and after a full cycle do the joints begin to unseal. If one abruptly ingests to satiety at the outset, it leads to *qi*-induced illness, with the abdomen distended and oppressed—this is no true path. Initially, one should ingest sparingly; after three years, one may ingest freely as desired. But for beginners, whose limbs and joints remain unopened and whose skin is still sealed, abrupt over-ingestion causes the abdomen to swell and oppress—how can one find peace?\n\nIt is also claimed that before noon (the hour of *si*) is *sheng-qi* (life-generating *qi*), and after noon is *si-qi* (death-inducing *qi*), with only *sheng-qi* fit for ingestion and *si-qi* unfit. What nonsense! Though one may eat three meals a day, when traveling as a guest or pressed by official duties, one eats when opportunity arises, heedless of the hour. *Qi* is the same: ingest it when present, without concern for \"life\" or \"death\" *qi*.\n\nAnother method advises drawing *qi* deeply through the nose, filling the mouth before swallowing, then exhaling slightly, with each inhalation drawn long and full. Yet the Way of ingesting *qi* is fundamentally called *taixi* (embryonic breathing). *Taixi* resembles an infant in the womb, who for ten months grows and matures without eating, its bones delicate, sinews supple, and grasp firm—all because it is free of thought and retains the primordial *qi*. The moment it leaves the womb, it breathes external *qi*, cries aloud, and becomes aware of dryness, dampness, hunger, and satiety—this is the loss of primordial *qi*. Now, drawing *qi* through the nose and swallowing it is an external practice, unfit for true ingestion.\n\nIt is further said: To draw *sheng-qi*, follow the five directions, aligning the heart and face accordingly. First envision the green *qi* of the east, then the red *qi* of the south, the white *qi* of the west, the black *qi* of the north, and finally the yellow *qi* of the center, all summoned through focused intention. This, too, is incorrect. For one who ingests *qi*, first still all thoughts and concerns, severing the threads of distraction, until a serene harmony arises naturally. Then swallow, allowing the *qi* to return to its proper place, settling all without exception. The five directions each correspond to the five viscera—why summon them with intention? Thought gives rise to distraction, distraction unsettles the heart, an unsettled heart disrupts *qi*, disrupted *qi* loses its natural rhythm, losing rhythm invites pathogenic *qi*, pathogenic *qi* breeds illness, and illness proliferates into a hundred afflictions. Thus the *Scripture of the Yellow Court* states: \"Dwell solely on the one, and longevity knows no end.\" It does not mean each resides separately, arrayed in the brain with fixed positions and outward-facing postures. What exists in the heart aligns accordingly—this is the true meaning. Those who envision the five directions are unfit for ingestion.\n\nIt is also said that swallowing to fullness and making a *pengpeng* sound is the supreme method. Yet when first ingesting *qi*, one should begin sparingly to ensure smooth passage. Only when the hundred pores open, and with each breath held, sweat permeates the entire body, can one ingest a thousand *qi* without blockage. The *pengpeng* sound indicates obstruction, not smoothness. It yellows the complexion, harms the five viscera, and unsettles the heart.\n\nIt is further said: \"Before the fifteenth day, *qi* exits through the hands; after the fifteenth day, it exits through the feet.\"\n\nThose who engage in visualization (*cunxiang*) find it arduous, and while it may be employed at times, one should not persist in such thoughts when free of illness. As the *Huangting Jing* states: *\"Let nothing disturb your peace and equilibrium\"*—this refers to the absence of thoughts. It further says: When first ingesting *qi* and desiring to cease grain, after twenty-one days one will be free from hunger. Hold the breath for ninety cycles, then swallow once, filling the abdomen halfway—do not allow it to exit forcefully, nor strike it with intention. Let it ascend to open the upper passages and descend to reach the feet.\n\nIt also says: Visualize the *qi* ascending from the feet through the kidneys to the throat, then imagine the five-colored *qi*. For those who abruptly cease grain at the outset, as previously explained, direct the *qi* to each of the five viscera in turn, guiding it with intention to disperse. What does this mean? If one has seven orifices above, it harms the person—how could success be achieved in merely twenty-one days? When the three-year practice is complete, the primordial *qi* will settle, the *qi*-sea will congeal, and one may cease grain at will—how could this depend on counting days or moving thoughts?\n\nIt further says: Count ten breaths, then one breath, then bend a finger, reaching seventeen breaths before swallowing. Or release *qi* in four sets of nine (thirty-six), then turn the body after three hundred and sixty breaths. Yet when ingesting true *qi*, one must abandon thoughts and relinquish intention, dwelling in the realm of non-action and entrusting the body to its natural state. How can one bend fingers to count or turn the body to keep track? Simply follow one’s nature in walking, standing, sitting, or lying down—when the stomach is empty, ingest *qi* as needed. Why labor over turning the body or counting breaths?\n\nIt also says: If the mouth lacks saliva, eat one or two jujubes, chewing the flesh but keeping the pits, holding them in the mouth to stimulate fluid. Yet for beginners, those lacking wisdom or skill cannot summon true saliva. Even if some fluid is induced this way, it remains impure and unusable. *Qi* should be drawn in and swallowed smoothly, then after a long pause, ingested again. The nose should draw in long breaths continuously, like water pouring from a vessel. Such methods are nothing less than lethal—how can one preserve spirit? Overfilling is also deadly.\n\nIt further says: Simply hold the breath to feel sated. If ill, hold the breath to attack the affliction, expelling according to the five viscera. Yet if one is ill and immediately attacks it, how is the attack to be conducted, and how much *qi* should be used? Such practices are also lethal. Without understanding the proper timing and regulation, it says: Secure the *qi* to prevent leakage, focusing on the lower orifices. If the upper passages are blocked, causing heat and congestion, it is due to disharmony in the three *qi*-passages. For beginners, one must first ensure the *qi* flows freely, ascending with ingestion and descending with release. If there is leakage, it cannot be secured—this will be explained separately later.\n\n**Method of Ingesting *Qi*:**\nWhen ingesting *qi*, first examine the *qi*-conditions and recognize the symptoms of illness. There is one way to draw in *qi* and six ways to expel it—one must know these six *qi* before ingesting. Though the six *qi* are described in old texts, how are their conditions to be discerned? Merely hearing the directions, who can recognize their signs? Here they are recorded as follows:\n\nFor those learning to ingest *qi* due to blockage in the three *qi*-passages, *qi* must not stagnate in the upper passage, lest it cause chest congestion and obstruction. First learn to regulate the *qi*-conditions, distinguish the six *qi*, and expel the foul *qi* of the five viscera. Only then can one ingest *qi*, allowing the pure *qi* to descend—each swallow will be beneficial, and no effort will be wasted.\n\n**Regulating *Qi*:**\nFirst, observe the \"gates and doors.\" The nose is the Heavenly Gate, the mouth the Earthly Door. Always draw *qi* in through the nose and expel it through the mouth—if *qi* is obstructed, it will stagnate; if it flows smoothly, it will circulate. This follows the principles of yin and yang. Once you understand the gates, their reversals, and the division of yin and yang, you must practice accordingly. Whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, always draw *qi* in through the nose and expel it through the mouth. Drawing in takes in the pure; expelling releases the turbid. The turbid arises from the five viscera—why do the five viscera produce turbid *qi*? Because of the five flavors. Each flavor corresponds to a viscus, and each viscus expels its turbid *qi* through the mouth. The six bowels also share this passage, where impurities converge to form turbid *qi*.\n\nHow can one discern turbid *qi*? At night, when sleeping with the mouth closed, the *qi* of the five viscera becomes congested in the throat. Upon waking, open the mouth wide to examine—if there is a foul, putrid odor, this reveals the turbidity and foulness of the *qi*. When the mouth is dry, bitter, or astringent, the cheeks lack saliva, or the throat is sore and unable to eat, these are signs of heat. One must then open the mouth wide and exhale forcefully, following the gates and doors for entry and exit. Exhale ten or twenty times, then \"strike the Heavenly Drum\" (i.e., click the teeth). Click the teeth seven or eight times, swirl the tongue in the Flower Pool (*Huachi*), and swallow the saliva. As the *Huangting Jing* says: *\"Swallow the numinous fluid, and no calamity will approach.\"* This is the meaning.\n\nNext, rely on natural breathing, allowing *qi* to enter and exit freely. Adjust for three or four breaths, then open the mouth wide to exhale. After exhaling, regulate again. Repeat this process until the heat is fully dispelled. How can one know? If *qi* enters through the mouth and exits through the nose, it is reversed (*niqi*); if clear water and sweet nectar arise in the throat, the heat has receded, and the five viscera are cooled. As the *Huangting Jing* states: *\"The Jade Pool’s clear water irrigates the numinous root—if you can cultivate this, you may endure forever.\"* This refers to the sweet nectar and clear water. By constantly regulating and examining these signs, the five viscera will remain free of illness. If one can accurately discern these conditions, the three *qi*-passages will naturally open, and ingesting *qi* will be wholly beneficial, with no effort wasted.\n\n*Qi* is governed by the heart: if the heart is deviant, the *qi* is deviant; if the heart is upright, the *qi* is upright. All movements of the hands and feet, joy and anger, sorrow and happiness, arise from the heart. The heart’s thoughts are all *qi*; *qi* responds to intention, and intention follows the heart. Thus, when *qi* is whole, the body is whole; when *qi* is cut off, the spirit perishes; when the spirit perishes, the body dies.\n\nThus, physicians first examine the pulse to observe the five viscera, the four seasons, the correspondence of pulse and *qi*-signs, and thereby discern the source of illness before seeking remedies. Yet if one can merely discern the *qi*-signs, the five viscera will naturally harmonize, the pulse will regulate, and *qi* will flow smoothly.\n\nHow is this known? The five viscera govern the five *qi* and correspond to the five directions. When the visceral *qi* is harmonized, the four seasons follow their natural order. Moreover, if one can examine the mouth and nose, regulating intake and expulsion even for a brief moment, cold and heat will not invade.\n\nThe *Classic* states: *How does one know cold and heat?* Inhalation is singular, while exhalation has six forms. These six are: *yan*, *he*, *hu*, *xu*, *chui*, and *xi*—these are the six *qi*. The six *qi* correspond to the five viscera, with each *qi* governing one viscus, while the remaining *qi* belongs to the three *qi*-passages. *Yan* pertains to the lungs, which govern the nose; if the nose suffers from disharmony of cold and heat, regulate it through *yan* inhalation and exhalation, and it will also treat skin sores. For such ailments, apply the method according to the symptoms. *He* pertains to the heart, which governs the tongue; if the tongue is parched and *qi* is obstructed due to heat, expel it with *he*. For extreme heat, open the mouth wide, but one must act with deliberate moderation—excess will harm the person. *Hu* pertains to the spleen, which governs the central palace of earth; if *qi* is mildly heated and disharmonious, causing abdominal distension, fullness, or stagnant *qi* that cannot be vented, regulate it with *hu*. *Xu* pertains to the liver, which governs the eyes; if the eyes are warm or heated, regulate them with *xu*. *Chui* pertains to the kidneys, which govern the ears; if the lower back and legs are cold, or the yang path is weakened, regulate them with *chui*. *Xi* pertains to the three *qi*-passages.\n\nThough the above broadly outlines this principle, all disharmonies of cold and heat in the five viscera, six bowels, and three *qi*-passages ultimately belong to the heart, which governs *he*. Simply regulate them through inhalation and exhalation, and all illnesses will be cured—there is no need to rely solely on the six *qi* for adjustment.\n\nWhen regulating *qi*, follow the natural passage of entry and exit through the \"gateways.\" If overdone, the throat may become dry; upon sensing dryness, close the mouth and allow *qi* to enter and exit through the nose. This will generate saliva in the mouth, moisten the throat, and one may then swallow it. Further observation: if the mouth is free of foul heat and *qi*, and the five viscera are harmonized, no regulation is needed. Whether walking, standing, or sitting, one may press the tongue against the palate and swallow, and the complexion will glow.\n\nAn ancient *Classic* states: *Absorb the generative* qi *of the midnight hour, and take the six seasonal nodes to guide its ingestion.* At first, the practice may feel intensely hot, and many proceed without order or measure, gradually refining their practice. Yet most people do not comprehend this; they merely follow the method without seeking a teacher’s instruction, mistaking it for the true Way. When they practice, many are harmed—some fall ill, others shorten their natural lifespan. Such cases are too numerous to count. Some claim *qi*-practice yields no benefit, while others say hasty practice is useless. Years pass idly, and when will success come? Or, if one never encounters a true teacher, their resolve wavers, and at the crossroads of doubt, this lifetime is squandered.\n\nNow, to ensure swift attainment of results, I have personally experienced both the harms and benefits of this practice, having spent many years refining it. Both truth and error are now clear. Those who practice hereafter will avoid mistakes, their progress will surpass each day, illnesses will vanish as if by divine intervention, and the effects will be immediate—success or failure evident in an instant.\n\nBeginners often find the three *qi*-passages unopened, causing *qi* to accumulate in the upper regions. If *qi* stagnates, the chest and heart become oppressed, which harms the person. Without knowing how to regulate it, one must proceed with utmost care.\n\nThose new to the practice should first regulate their diet, eating at fixed times and avoiding foods that disrupt the sequence of cultivation. With unwavering sincerity, expel the Three Corpses, relinquish glory and wealth, moderate desires, and distance oneself from riches. Only then can one draw near the Dao, gradually achieving success. Long life and enhanced vitality will not be in vain.\n\nIf one cannot adhere to this, merely knowing it superficially will yield no results. Those who cultivate the true Way fall into three ranks, each adapting to their time and circumstances, and none should cling rigidly to a single method. A brief outline follows:\n\nThe superior practitioner possesses a serene nature, a refined will, and speech aligned with the Dao. Their conduct is flawless. Such individuals carry the legacy of past lives, like a stone cast into water—no comparison suffices. They are akin to those of superior wisdom who awaken early.\n\nThe middling practitioner may hold high office, wield great influence, command vast networks, or aspire to fame and rank. Torn between doubt and resolve, they vacillate, wasting time. Upon hearing the Dao, they are restless even in sleep, their thoughts consumed by it day and night. Their hearts wage war, and the victor prevails. Yet in hesitation, six or seven out of ten are lost. They resemble those of middling wisdom who awaken late.\n\nThe inferior practitioner has let two-thirds of life slip by, their twilight years marked by frailty, their strength and spirit waning. Though they may enjoy wealth like embroidered robes, they are as one walking at night as the sun sets in the west—suddenly, like a candle in the wind. When they recall the Dao, it is as if gnawing their own navel. In stillness, they reflect and sigh deeply. Yet even such as these, if they rouse themselves with determination, may still save one or two out of ten. Those over eighty, however, have their karmic fate sealed, and can only pray for the next life.\n\nThe ancient sages lamented these three ranks to instruct later generations. May those with deep roots and unwavering resolve succeed without regression, attaining boundless fortune and longevity—is this not excellent?\n\nThe practice of ingesting *qi* is fundamentally called *fetal breathing*. *Fetal breathing* resembles an infant in the womb for ten months, growing and maturing without eating. Its bones are delicate, its sinews supple, its grip firm, and it abides in oneness. Having just received the true *qi*, it is free of thought or念, utterly still and serene. It receives the primordial *qi* and transforms, opening its joints and viscera—all is natural. The moment it leaves the womb, it inhales external *qi* and cries aloud, sensing dryness, dampness, and hunger, as if thoughts arise, and the primordial *qi* is lost.\n\nNow, what people practice as *fetal breathing* is likened to an infant in the womb—this is called *fetal breathing*, the ingestion of internal *qi*. The old scriptures say: \"Drawing external *qi* through the nose is deeply not the correct method.\" For those who wish to practice *qi*-ingestion, choose the time after midnight upon waking from sleep or at dawn upon waking. Follow the previous method of regulating breath and exhalation, assessing the state of *qi* and weather, rinsing and swallowing the numinous fluid. Then lie supine, stretch out the hands and feet, lower the head onto the pillow, and rest. Settle the mind without severing thought, allowing *qi* to flow in and out through the natural gates of respiration. Suddenly close the mouth; once internal *qi* is present, draw it upward into the mouth, gently swell the cheeks, and swallow it downward. Use intention to guide it, then rub the hands over the heart to direct the *qi* downward. Regulate the breath six or seven times, then swallow another *qi*-draft. Follow the previous method, rubbing with the hands. After swallowing twenty *qi*-drafts, pause. At dawn, proceed as convenient—whether sitting or lying down—swallowing over ten more drafts. For each swallow, regulate the breath forty to fifty times, then swallow slowly. Do not swallow hastily unless necessary. Each swallow must be accompanied by hand-rubbing to guide it downward, using intention to send it further down. Observe: if the upper passage is clear, the *qi* will descend past the navel; if not, it will linger in the chest. Wait until mealtime—if the upper passage feels empty and the *qi* flows downward, eat as usual. If not yet hungry, do not eat. When eating, do not become full, for satiety obstructs *qi*-ingestion. After eating, wait until the heart and abdomen feel slightly empty, then ingest twenty more drafts. Repeat this at night after eating, waiting until the heart feels empty before swallowing another twenty drafts. Cease thereafter. Whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, follow this daily regimen for one hundred days.\n\nEach swallow should be spaced by ten breaths—this is optimal. Initially, the three *jiao* are not yet open, and the joints remain closed. Fearful of blockage, do not ingest excessively. Every ten days, increase by three to five drafts until reaching one hundred days. After one hundred fifty days, add another four to five drafts, totaling two hundred. After a full year, the *qi* flows freely, the joints open, the skin becomes supple, and the pores unblock. When the abdomen feels empty, swallow three or five drafts in succession as desired, without fixed limits—though do not exceed three hundred drafts. After three years, the *qi* circulates fully, the five viscera are nourished, the bones and marrow strengthen, and the skin becomes firm and full. Then, the number of swallows is no longer restricted, and even abstaining from grains is possible.\n\nIf, before three years have passed, one first suffers the five taxations and seven injuries, depleting the viscera and bowels, scorching the hundred joints, and cannot gradually repair them—yet abruptly severs the root in hopes of prolonging life—while also failing to sever worldly attachments, remaining entangled in the six senses, wealth, and desire, merely enduring hunger, gradually cutting off grain-*qi*, lacking medicinal nourishment, and inviting new illnesses, then myriad diseases will converge. How can one who thinks to avoid death possibly succeed?\n\nAfter practicing *qi*-ingestion, one must also understand the order of eating. Each morning at mealtime, consume a small portion of bland watery congee to harmonize the spleen-*qi* and replenish bodily fluids. At midday, eat one or two plain calcium cakes or boiled scallion and lotus root soup—avoid consuming anything hot. In the evening, if hungry, boil a small amount of plain calcium! (Note: likely a transcription error for \"cake\" or similar) and rice, cooking them together for thirty to forty boiling cycles before eating. Never eat to fullness; always leave three to five mouthfuls uneaten, maintaining a slight internal emptiness—this is best. A single full meal obstructs the *qi*-pathway, ruining a day’s progress. Strictly avoid greasy, rich foods, raw vegetables, radishes, stale or foul-smelling items, and all meat or pungent foods.\n\nFor the first thirty to fifty days, one may feel slight hunger and cravings. Once the *qi* is regulated and the abdomen gradually moistened, all cravings for flavors vanish. The aforementioned congee, cakes, and the like may be consumed as convenient—there is no need to adhere rigidly to daily schedules. The general dietary order is as follows; choose what is stable and convenient. Occasionally, a meal of watery congee is also excellent.\n\nWhen the three *jiao* first open after practicing *qi*-ingestion, the stomach’s entrance unblocks, the five viscera harmonize, sweet fluids arise, the Jade Pool (mouth) becomes refined, and food tastes sweet—like a convalescent craving nourishment, finding all things delicious. One must exercise restraint; yielding to desire will cause great harm. At the slightest awareness, eat sparingly.\n\nAfter every meal, the food contains toxins and the heat of the five flavors. Immediately after eating, open the mouth and exhale to expel the heat until the warmth in the mouth subsides—this prevents illness. One must also moderate salt and pungent or sour flavors, which should not be consumed. Initially, this may be difficult, but after twenty days, numinous fluids and spiritual springs emerge. If salty or pungent flavors are consumed, the practice of *qi*-ingestion is compromised. Once the five viscera are moistened, the true *qi* descends, expelling all accumulated malign *qi*. As the malign *qi* drains downward, it may harm the stomach. Avoid cold, hot, greasy, raw, or hard foods. If one carelessly consumes even a single mouthful, a slight pain may be felt where the food lodges. With deep practice, one will naturally recognize this afterward. Only consume soft, well-cooked foods—this is essential. After eating, one must exhale as described.\n\nBefore each meal, eat twenty to thirty raw Sichuan peppercorns, then drink water and proceed with the meal. If discomfort arises after eating, consume another twenty peppercorns upon feeling full—this is beneficial. Sichuan peppercorns unblock the three *jiao*, expel malign *qi*, dissolve stagnant food, and guide the true *qi*. If *qi* rises and causes oppression in the chest, hold two or three peppercorns in the mouth—the discomfort will immediately dissipate. The efficacy of Sichuan peppercorns is beyond words.\n\nIf sudden fullness, oppression, or *qi* congestion arises, one must sit quietly and regulate the breath—after a short while, the discomfort will disperse and descend. An old text states: \"Secure the *qi* to prevent its descent.\" In the past, beginners adhered to this and restrained their *qi*, but soon their abdomens became distended and agonized, verging on death. There are two passages below that connect upward, through which the mouth and nose exchange breath with the five viscera. If malign *qi* from prior stagnation must be expelled, how can one restrain it? Restraint causes *qi* blockage; blockage leads to pain. Thus, when old *qi* has yet to exit and new *qi* suddenly enters, the two collide and give rise to affliction. One must not restrain it—unobstructed release is optimal.\n\nFurthermore, drinking one or two cups of wine on an empty stomach each day, as inclination allows, is highly beneficial. However, one must not become muddled or oppressed. If one can sip three to five cups daily in a steady stream, it greatly aids the *qi* pathways. The wine must be clear and fine to be suitable; overindulgence should be avoided, for a single bout of vomiting may disrupt *qi* for days. Yet if one wishes to drink more when in high spirits, there is a method: when drinking with ten or five companions, as cups are passed, after each sip, open the mouth and exhale seven or eight breaths to expel the wine’s toxicity. If many cups arrive at once, open the mouth wide and exhale forcefully; if sipping gradually, a gentle exhalation suffices. In ordinary breathing, one may exhale and guide the *qi* outward. If one can persist in this regulation throughout the feast, one who typically drinks three *sheng* may that day drink a *dou*—yet remain uninebriated, avoid the aftereffects of wine, and not lose its flavor, drinking all day without fatigue. Upon waking from sleep, rinse the mouth, swallow saliva, and regulate the breath as usual.\n\nIf *qi* unexpectedly descends at inopportune moments—while eating, in the presence of guests, while riding, before elders or parents—what is to be done? One must seek an opportune moment to release it. If one forcibly restrains a single breath, it will surge upward, churning in the viscera and stomach, causing prolonged pain in the heart and ribs, or even vomiting with chaotic *qi* and oppression. If public or private duties preclude proper care, one should avoid pungent and meaty foods; even if *qi* descends, it will not be foul. After ceasing grain, even one or two releases will be odorless.\n\nMoreover, the *qi* of childbirth and all foul, malign *qi* from severe illness must not be encountered, for they deeply harm the true *qi*. If one must traverse the streets and encounters such malign *qi*, hold the breath and pass through. Otherwise, drink wine to imbue oneself with its *qi*, or consume a small amount of pungent or meaty food—these can also repel it. If malign *qi* has already entered and causes discomfort, regulate the breath to expel it. Furthermore, one must not loudly sing, weep, or shout. If social obligations require condolences, speak softly and avoid excessive weeping.\n\nIf *qi* suddenly surges upward toward the throat, do not allow it to ascend—swallow to force it back down, then inhale and swallow three to five times to settle it. Additionally, massage with the hands to disperse it downward. Holding Sichuan peppercorns in the mouth or drinking wine will also dissipate it. If swallowing proves difficult, do not force it, lest it congest the upper passages. Assess the situation and act accordingly. If the *qi* has not dispersed, do not eat. After eating to fullness, do not swallow, for the food will obstruct its descent and cause illness.\n\nWith each swallow, close the mouth and suspend nasal breathing until the breath steadies. Then, with the mind, guide the *qi* outward and observe its descent along the left side through the twenty-four nodes, each passage audible like water flowing over ridges—distinctly perceptible. If no sound is heard, it indicates stagnation from oily or untimely consumption. If not addressed early, further *qi* practice will compound the issue, inevitably leading to illness—utmost caution is required.\n\nBeginners in *qi* practice often covet quick results and deceive themselves about their *qi*, believing that increasing intake is progress. Daily, they may add ten or twenty breaths, and when feeling stable, further increase to thirty or fifty, gradually escalating, convinced of their advancement. Unaware that the *qi* has not yet flowed smoothly, they instead form blockages. Though illness takes root in the abdomen, the body remains oblivious. As symptoms emerge, they persist in their ways, day by day accumulating until a *qi* ailment solidifies—suddenly afflicting the ribs, which is then difficult to remedy with medicine.\n\nAfter three years of practice, even if one encounters setbacks, no harm will come. Daily *qi* swallowing may reach a thousand gulps without fear. After nine years, the practice will never regress, and the joints will interconnect. As the *Huangting Jing* states: \"A thousand thousand, a hundred hundred, linked in succession; ten by ten, like layered mountains.\" This describes the sinews and bones becoming interconnected. Thus, the five viscera may thereafter enter water without drowning. The inner *qi* does not exit, nor does the outer *qi* enter—even ten or twenty days may pass without issue. Neither extreme cold nor heat will cause fear, and neither age nor youth will be a hindrance.\n\nThe *qi* must be firmly grasped and controlled. Initially, before the *qi* flows, one cannot yet grasp it. After half a year or a hundred days, when the *qi* flows smoothly and the palms sweat, one may then grasp it. The *Huangting Jing* says: \"Seal the three passes, grasp firmly, and halt; rinse with golden nectar and swallow jade blossoms.\" Thus, hunger ceases, the Three Worms perish, the mind remains peaceful, and hearing sharpens.\n\nThe *qi* sea lies below the navel, yet most people’s three passages are blocked. Ordinary breathing does not reach below the navel, and those with hurried, unsteady breath have *qi* that has not descended, lingering in the upper passages of the heart and chest. For beginners who have swallowed *qi* for ten or five days, the upper passage remains unopened. After ten to twenty days, one should perceive the *qi* descending through the barriers and ridges, entering the *qi* sea with a faint, resonant sound—subtly sensing the *qi*’s movement.\n\nWhen the *qi* reaches the *qi* sea, it lengthens, and the *qi* condition becomes harmonious and refined.\n\nPrevious texts were not meticulous, merely mentioning prohibitions and taboos, leading many later practitioners to harm their true *qi*, abandoning their practice midway. Since cultivation inevitably involves both gains and losses, I now describe these details again with care.\n\nIn regulating the *qi*, one must attend to its exhalation and inhalation with utmost precision—do not rely on what you hear, for hearing alone will damage the true *qi*. Only when you feel intense heat may you exhale slightly with a *he* breath, but once the heat subsides, you must resume careful regulation.\n\nWhen first swallowing *qi* without knowing how to guide it, take one swallow as a measure: fill the mouth with *qi* by vigorously stirring it, then contract the throat and swallow. After mastering the swallow, once the upper passage opens, there is no need to stir the *qi*; simply close the mouth, hold the breath, and swallow naturally without drawing or expelling *qi*. Swallow three times in succession, then exhale once before swallowing again. Later, swallow eight or nine times before exhaling, or even twenty or thirty times before exhaling. This is when the *qi* descends, reaching the *qi* sea smoothly, and the sinews and vessels become unobstructed.\n\nAt times, intentionally test the length and flow of the *qi* to discern whether it is open or blocked. However, do not always rely on frequent swallowing, for excessive swallowing is not beneficial and disrupts stability. For steadiness, close the mouth and swallow once, directing the *qi* downward with the mind to the *qi* sea. Then swallow again without exhaling—this is the regular practice.\n\nAt first, when unfamiliar with the method, one cannot avoid using the mind to guide the *qi* downward. Later, once you understand the *qi*’s rhythm and sequence, let go of all thoughts and swallow naturally, allowing the *qi* to settle into its proper place without using the hands to press or guide it over the heart.\n\nThe scriptures ask: *Why teach without words?* All things arise yet are not created; they grow yet claim no merit; their work is accomplished yet not possessed. The teaching without words means the mind abides in spontaneity, in non-action and non-thought, nurturing the five viscera and six bowels. \"Growing yet not possessing\" means the *qi* of the Dao is generated within the body, yet the body does not cling to its existence. Success is achieved effortlessly; once accomplished, it is not dwelled upon. External actions are unseen; if seen, others will know. If others know, the self arises; if the self arises, fame follows; if fame follows, misfortune comes; if misfortune comes, the *qi* perishes; if the *qi* perishes, all is lost.\n\nThus, the *Huangting Jing* states: *\"If you can know the One, all things are complete.\"*\n\nRegarding the timing of *qi*-swallowing—midnight, the fifth watch, and three times daily—as well as the sequence of eating, these are fully detailed for beginners. Those deeply versed in the practice will adapt flexibly as circumstances arise; do not cling rigidly to rules. Clinging breeds anxiety, anxiety stirs the heart, and a bound heart leads to labor, which causes progress to regress.\n\nTake heed! Take heed!\n\nThe *Scriptures of the Immortals* state: When a person nears death, they begin to cherish their body; once guilt is determined, they think of reforming; when illness has taken hold, they seek medicine—yet the net of Heaven has already been cast, and nothing can be retrieved. Thus, the wise and superior person cherishes life before danger arises, fears misfortune before it strikes, and cultivates health before illness takes root. This is the true superior person, truly called one who preserves and cherishes.\n\nIt is also said that there are three stages of life: the upper years, middle years, and lower years. The upper years span from twenty to thirty, the middle years from forty to fifty, and the lower years from sixty to seventy. Those above eighty have already had their fate determined. In the upper years, one is humble, awakens to the true Dao, comprehends its profound subtleties, possesses a sturdy frame, strong sinews, and full flesh. If one sets their heart upon the Dao and treads its path, there is nothing that cannot be accomplished. In the middle years, awakening to the Dao comes late; sinews, flesh, bones, and marrow are each only half as strong. One stands at a crossroads, and the efficacy of practice is slight. In the lower years, at sixty or seventy, bones, marrow, sinews, and vessels retain only two or three parts in ten. The day is late for practice, yet one may still be saved. For those above eighty, the brain is exhausted, marrow depleted, all passages dried and withered, spirit departed, *qi* vanished—moving like a corpse, walking like a ghost. There is no salvation.\n\nThus, the ancient sages and superior persons, knowing the fragility of life like a candle in the wind, resolutely abandoned worldly toil, cherished their bodies as treasure, and retired to secluded mountains to still their hearts and return to the Dao. The Dao is *qi*; *qi* is the root of the body. As a fish dies when removed from water, a person cannot be whole when separated from the Dao. The cultivation of life lies in refining *qi*; the refinement of *qi* lies in preserving essence. When essence and *qi* are both complete, this is called true treasure.\n\nHumans possess three cinnabar fields: the Upper, Middle, and Lower *Dantian*. The Upper *Dantian* is the *Niwan* brain, also called the \"Imperial Realm\"; the Middle *Dantian* is the heart, also named the \"Crimson Palace Perfected One\"; the Lower *Dantian* is the *Qihai* (Sea of *Qi*), also called the \"Gate of Essence.\" Each of these three fields has its own spirit; if one spirit is deficient, *qi* leaks and essence dissipates. Once dissipated, *qi* scatters. Essence is the root of the body; the root is the seat of *qi*. When essence is complete, *qi* is complete; when essence leaks, *qi* leaks. Only essence and *qi* must be preserved in full.\n\nThe *Huangting Jing* states:\n*\"For long life, be most cautious in the chamber of desire—why invite death and make the spirits weep? If the sea of essence is lost like a hundred streams pouring out, leaves fall and the tree withers, losing its verdant hue.\"*\n\nThus, the ancient sages who aspired to the Dao all cherished *qi* and preserved essence to attain wholeness.\n\nThe method of refining *qi* builds upon the practice of *qi*-swallowing. When time permits, find a quiet room with no one present. Loosen the hair, remove clothing, cover yourself with a blanket, and lie flat on your back. Extend both feet and hands without clenching them. Place a clean mat beside your head, letting it hang down to the ground. Comb your hair thoroughly so it spreads loosely upon the mat. Then regulate your breath. Once the breath is steady, exhale through the mouth. At first, the exhalation may be rapid and labored; regulate it seven or eight times, or up to ten breaths, until the rapid breathing settles. Once settled, refine it again. When time allows, refine it ten times and stop. Initially, if *qi* is not yet flowing smoothly, it may stagnate in the skin—this is undesirable. If there is more time, refine it further, adding five or six more repetitions, gradually increasing to twenty, thirty, or even forty or fifty, with no fixed limit.\n\nWhat is the standard? If one has not practiced *qi*-swallowing for long, but progress is being made, the joints will open and the pores will unseal. When refining reaches twenty or thirty repetitions, the entire body will become moist, and sweat will emerge. This is the sign of efficacy. At first, when *qi* flows smoothly, stop. Gradual sweating is good. Afterward, do not rise too soon or expose yourself to drafts. Like a patient who has just sweated, rest for a long while, then put on clean clothes. Walk slowly in a windless place, speak little to preserve *qi*, reduce activity, and calm the mind. Then the body will feel light, the hundred vessels will flow freely, and the four limbs will be unobstructed.\n\nThus, the *Huangting Jing* states: *\"A thousand disasters vanish, a hundred illnesses heal; one need not fear the ferocity of tigers and wolves. This also reverses aging and extends the years.\"*\n\nFor refining *qi*, one may practice at any convenient time during the night or at noon, whenever the spirit and energy are clear and refreshed. Sit upright and follow the previous sequence diligently, swallowing *qi* frequently. Do not grow lax or careless. If drowsy or sluggish, do not force yourself to sit, for forcing it will invite disorder into the mind. A disordered mind leads to chaotic *qi*, and the true Dao is lost. Initially, when *qi* is not yet stable, drowsiness may arise, but after some time, there will be no more drowsiness.\n\nRefining *qi* need not be done daily. If one has spare time every five or ten days and feels obstructed or restless in the four limbs, practice it. On regular days, to avoid lack of progress, do not practice too frequently.\n\nThe method of releasing *qi*: When cultivating and releasing *qi*, wait until the four limbs are calm and the mind is free of thoughts. Whether sitting or otherwise, let the *qi* follow the natural openings and regulate the breath. Relax the body completely, as if laying down a garment—boneless, fleshless, without spirit or consciousness. Let the heart and ears roam freely. In this state of release, the body becomes as if ownerless, sinking into stillness. Relax the form, release the body, calm the spirit, and refine the *qi*. Then the hundred joints will open, sinews and vessels will flow smoothly, and fluids will circulate. At this point, swallow ten breaths of *qi*, or even up to twenty. With each swallow, remain utterly passive, allowing the *qi* to move without resistance. After a long while, the *qi* will exit through the pores, and no longer need to be expelled through the mouth. Even if ten breaths were taken, only one or two may remain. Then regulate the breath again, taking several dozen or even a hundred breaths. If panting occurs, gently inhale a small amount of *qi* and swallow it, then regulate the breath again.\n\nWhen regulating the breath, the four limbs, skin, flesh, and joints will gradually feel as if bathed. Whenever time permits, do not lie on the back or side. Whether sitting or standing, release the *qi* and relax the body. Practicing this daily will advance one’s progress. Essence will be full, *qi* complete, spirit settled, and the *po* stabilized. The mind will be at ease, thoughts far-reaching, the Dao flourishing, and virtue tranquil. The Three Corpses will vanish, and the Six Dusts will be extinguished.\n\nThus the *Huangting Jing* states: \"In leisure, with nothing to do, the body is at peace; the dwelling of emptiness lies only in stillness.\" Simply nurture *qi* through non-action, surrendering both body and mind, releasing form and thought, merging with the Dao in unity—then one will naturally perceive the subtle signs. The *Huangting Jing* says: \"Sit upright in non-action, and the hun and po are at peace; in purity, the spirit appears and speaks to me.\" This is what it means.\n\nAs for surrendering *qi*: if one suddenly feels disharmony in the four limbs, blockages in the body, or imbalance in the breath, surrender it—whether lying down or sitting. Calm the spirit, surrender the breath, and focus the mind. In stillness, settle the heart. Over time, as concentration deepens, one will feel the *qi* flowing unimpeded, reaching everywhere.\n\nThe breath-holding method: Those of superior wisdom, with firm resolve and far-reaching thoughts, cultivate themselves without the slightest neglect. Their spirit is settled, their *qi* harmonized, and external illnesses are eradicated. Yet there are those of middling wisdom—perhaps their worldly affairs are unfinished, or their minds waver between progress and retreat. They disregard prohibitions, fail in proper regulation, and their *qi* stagnates, leading to illness. If discomfort arises, enter a quiet room, lie supine, and carefully regulate the breath. Extend the hands and feet, spacing them four or five inches apart. Ensure the bedding is thick and soft; in winter, keep warm with a blanket. Calm the mind, relax the body, then swallow *qi* and immediately hold the breath, keeping the mouth and nose still. Focus the mind on the afflicted area, directing *qi* there with intention. When the breath reaches its limit, exhale, then hold again. After the first exhalation, if the breath is labored, regulate it six or seven times until it flows smoothly, then hold again. Visualize the *qi* attacking the afflicted area—ten, twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty times—until sweat appears and the area feels unblocked, then stop. If not yet resolved, repeat at dawn or night, attacking the area with focused intention until it improves.\n\nIf the illness is in the left hand, direct *qi* straight to the left hand; if in the right, to the right. If in the head, direct it upward. Only when clear results are seen will one know that the mind can command *qi*, and *qi* follows intention, making it as potent as a spirit. Sorrow, joy, grief, and pleasure must not reside in the heart—for sorrow harms the spirit, and excessive joy scatters the will. Follow this method, and no illness will remain unhealed.\n\nThe fasting method: Those who wish to fast must first cultivate as previously described for three years. Once the five viscera are nurtured, the body strong, flesh full, the hundred spirits settled in their places, blood and vessels flowing freely, and the *qi* pathways unimpeded, one will move with increasing lightness each day. At this stage, one gradually ceases to crave the five flavors and loses the desire for food, making complete abstention effortless.\n\nYet some, bound by worldly desires and attachments, cannot sever their cravings. They seek out medical texts and consume herbs to stop eating. At first, the herbs may create a false sense of fullness, but once their effects fade, hunger returns, rendering the effort futile. Constantly preoccupied with herbs, they spend their days seeking the right combinations, ceaselessly driven, exhausting their strength and wit. Troubles multiply, and misfortune may follow. Even with herbs, how can one abruptly sever attachment to food? Some eat fruit to sustain themselves, others consume medicinal substances for satiety—yet is this not merely another form of self-regulation? Why endure the labor of chasing herbs or the toil of decocting them? Year after year, they waste their spirit in vain. How can they hope to reverse aging and return to youth?\n\nTo abstain from grain alone—how can this be called true fasting? Among those of lesser attainment who cannot immediately sever worldly affairs, taking herbs may offer slight benefit. But those of superior attainment do not pursue this path.\n\nFor those who have mastered *qi*-absorption and wish to fast, simply swallow *qi* whenever the stomach feels empty, regardless of time—morning or night—without obstruction. Swallow as needed, without limit, until one naturally senses the right measure. Avoid excessive swallowing, for prolonged practice leads to complete fasting, a process that unfolds naturally and need not be elaborated here.\n\nBeginners may combine herbs with *qi*-absorption, which is also effective. However, those who rely on herbs often neglect *qi*-absorption, making herbs their sole focus. The *Huangting Jing* states: \"The grains’ essence is the earth’s vitality; the five flavors’ external allure reeks of demonic corruption. They disturb the spirit and scatter the fetal *qi*, yet through this, one may reverse aging and return to infancy.\"\n\nFor those in official positions, immersed in worldly glory and burdened by duties, who yearn for the Dao yet cannot still their ambitions—if they spend their years in empty toil, waiting to renounce worldly desires only in old age, how can they firmly cultivate without gradual progress? Such individuals, pressed by public duties and unable to cultivate at the three appointed times, may instead practice at midnight or dawn. Upon waking, they should follow the previous method: rinse the mouth, swallow saliva, regulate the breath, and relax the lower face. When warm, swallow *qi* forty or fifty times, starting with ten or twenty and increasing by five each day, stopping at fifty. Even if official duties arise at daybreak, they should maintain their resolve and cultivate inwardly.\n\n*The Scripture on Regulating Qi of the Great Clarity* concludes.",

      "translated_text": "*The Supreme Clarity Scripture on Qi Regulation*\n\nThe *Scripture of the Immortals* states: At midnight (the hour of *zi*), ingest ninety-nine times eighty-one; at cockcrow, eighty-eight times sixty-four; at sunrise, sixty-six times thirty-six; at breakfast time, fifty-five times twenty-five; and at mid-morning, forty-four times sixteen.\n\nThe foregoing method has been transmitted among common folk and in old scriptures, yet those who practice it idly waste years in vain toil, enduring hardship without result, and in time suffer harm instead. This arises from failing to ingest the primordial *qi* and not recognizing the deep root. Such practices are widespread, yet prolonged adherence yields no verification, leaving the spirit exhausted and *qi* withered. Those who yearn for the Dao thus squander their lives, and in their hesitation, they forfeit their prime years—how lamentable! Such misguided paths must not be followed.\n\nAnother old scripture describes a method of abruptly fasting and ingesting *qi*, counting twelve double-hours in a day and night, with five hundred and forty swallows, repeating this cycle without end. Yet in one’s robust years, one is ensnared by desires and profit, unaware of the upright *qi*, let alone contemplating nurturance, calming the mind, or settling the spirit. By the time one’s years wane and the five viscera are already impaired, if one does not gradually cultivate and replenish but suddenly ceases eating, the primordial *qi* remains unfilled while ordinary sustenance is cut off. With neither sustaining the other, peril and demise follow, and the wish to preserve the body becomes unattainable.\n\nIt is further said that the measure lies in the number of swallows, and success in feeling sated. Yet when one first ingests *qi*, only after a hundred days does a slight passage open, and after a full cycle do the joints begin to unseal. If one abruptly ingests to satiety at the outset, it leads to *qi*-induced illness, with the abdomen distended and oppressed—this is no true path. Initially, one should ingest sparingly; after three years, one may ingest freely as desired. But for beginners, whose limbs and joints remain unopened and whose skin is still sealed, abrupt over-ingestion causes the abdomen to swell and oppress—how can one find peace?\n\nIt is also claimed that before noon (the hour of *si*) is *sheng-qi* (life-generating *qi*), and after noon is *si-qi* (death-inducing *qi*), with only *sheng-qi* fit for ingestion and *si-qi* unfit. What nonsense! Though one may eat three meals a day, when traveling as a guest or pressed by official duties, one eats when opportunity arises, heedless of the hour. *Qi* is the same: ingest it when present, without concern for \"life\" or \"death\" *qi*.\n\nAnother method advises drawing *qi* deeply through the nose, filling the mouth before swallowing, then exhaling slightly, with each inhalation drawn long and full. Yet the Way of ingesting *qi* is fundamentally called *taixi* (embryonic breathing). *Taixi* resembles an infant in the womb, who for ten months grows and matures without eating, its bones delicate, sinews supple, and grasp firm—all because it is free of thought and retains the primordial *qi*. The moment it leaves the womb, it breathes external *qi*, cries aloud, and becomes aware of dryness, dampness, hunger, and satiety—this is the loss of primordial *qi*. Now, drawing *qi* through the nose and swallowing it is an external practice, unfit for true ingestion.\n\nIt is further said: To draw *sheng-qi*, follow the five directions, aligning the heart and face accordingly. First envision the green *qi* of the east, then the red *qi* of the south, the white *qi* of the west, the black *qi* of the north, and finally the yellow *qi* of the center, all summoned through focused intention. This, too, is incorrect. For one who ingests *qi*, first still all thoughts and concerns, severing the threads of distraction, until a serene harmony arises naturally. Then swallow, allowing the *qi* to return to its proper place, settling all without exception. The five directions each correspond to the five viscera—why summon them with intention? Thought gives rise to distraction, distraction unsettles the heart, an unsettled heart disrupts *qi*, disrupted *qi* loses its natural rhythm, losing rhythm invites pathogenic *qi*, pathogenic *qi* breeds illness, and illness proliferates into a hundred afflictions. Thus the *Scripture of the Yellow Court* states: \"Dwell solely on the one, and longevity knows no end.\" It does not mean each resides separately, arrayed in the brain with fixed positions and outward-facing postures. What exists in the heart aligns accordingly—this is the true meaning. Those who envision the five directions are unfit for ingestion.\n\nIt is also said that swallowing to fullness and making a *pengpeng* sound is the supreme method. Yet when first ingesting *qi*, one should begin sparingly to ensure smooth passage. Only when the hundred pores open, and with each breath held, sweat permeates the entire body, can one ingest a thousand *qi* without blockage. The *pengpeng* sound indicates obstruction, not smoothness. It yellows the complexion, harms the five viscera, and unsettles the heart.\n\nIt is further said: \"Before the fifteenth day, *qi* exits through the hands; after the fifteenth day, it exits through the feet.\"",

      "translated_text": "Those who engage in visualization (*cunxiang*) find it arduous, and while it may be employed at times, one should not persist in such thoughts when free of illness. As the *Huangting Jing* states: *\"Let nothing disturb your peace and equilibrium\"*—this refers to the absence of thoughts. It further says: When first ingesting *qi* and desiring to cease grain, after twenty-one days one will be free from hunger. Hold the breath for ninety cycles, then swallow once, filling the abdomen halfway—do not allow it to exit forcefully, nor strike it with intention. Let it ascend to open the upper passages and descend to reach the feet.\n\nIt also says: Visualize the *qi* ascending from the feet through the kidneys to the throat, then imagine the five-colored *qi*. For those who abruptly cease grain at the outset, as previously explained, direct the *qi* to each of the five viscera in turn, guiding it with intention to disperse. What does this mean? If one has seven orifices above, it harms the person—how could success be achieved in merely twenty-one days? When the three-year practice is complete, the primordial *qi* will settle, the *qi*-sea will congeal, and one may cease grain at will—how could this depend on counting days or moving thoughts?\n\nIt further says: Count ten breaths, then one breath, then bend a finger, reaching seventeen breaths before swallowing. Or release *qi* in four sets of nine (thirty-six), then turn the body after three hundred and sixty breaths. Yet when ingesting true *qi*, one must abandon thoughts and relinquish intention, dwelling in the realm of non-action and entrusting the body to its natural state. How can one bend fingers to count or turn the body to keep track? Simply follow one’s nature in walking, standing, sitting, or lying down—when the stomach is empty, ingest *qi* as needed. Why labor over turning the body or counting breaths?\n\nIt also says: If the mouth lacks saliva, eat one or two jujubes, chewing the flesh but keeping the pits, holding them in the mouth to stimulate fluid. Yet for beginners, those lacking wisdom or skill cannot summon true saliva. Even if some fluid is induced this way, it remains impure and unusable. *Qi* should be drawn in and swallowed smoothly, then after a long pause, ingested again. The nose should draw in long breaths continuously, like water pouring from a vessel. Such methods are nothing less than lethal—how can one preserve spirit? Overfilling is also deadly.\n\nIt further says: Simply hold the breath to feel sated. If ill, hold the breath to attack the affliction, expelling according to the five viscera. Yet if one is ill and immediately attacks it, how is the attack to be conducted, and how much *qi* should be used? Such practices are also lethal. Without understanding the proper timing and regulation, it says: Secure the *qi* to prevent leakage, focusing on the lower orifices. If the upper passages are blocked, causing heat and congestion, it is due to disharmony in the three *qi*-passages. For beginners, one must first ensure the *qi* flows freely, ascending with ingestion and descending with release. If there is leakage, it cannot be secured—this will be explained separately later.\n\n**Method of Ingesting *Qi*:**\nWhen ingesting *qi*, first examine the *qi*-conditions and recognize the symptoms of illness. There is one way to draw in *qi* and six ways to expel it—one must know these six *qi* before ingesting. Though the six *qi* are described in old texts, how are their conditions to be discerned? Merely hearing the directions, who can recognize their signs? Here they are recorded as follows:\n\nFor those learning to ingest *qi* due to blockage in the three *qi*-passages, *qi* must not stagnate in the upper passage, lest it cause chest congestion and obstruction. First learn to regulate the *qi*-conditions, distinguish the six *qi*, and expel the foul *qi* of the five viscera. Only then can one ingest *qi*, allowing the pure *qi* to descend—each swallow will be beneficial, and no effort will be wasted.\n\n**Regulating *Qi*:**\nFirst, observe the \"gates and doors.\" The nose is the Heavenly Gate, the mouth the Earthly Door. Always draw *qi* in through the nose and expel it through the mouth—if *qi* is obstructed, it will stagnate; if it flows smoothly, it will circulate. This follows the principles of yin and yang. Once you understand the gates, their reversals, and the division of yin and yang, you must practice accordingly. Whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, always draw *qi* in through the nose and expel it through the mouth. Drawing in takes in the pure; expelling releases the turbid. The turbid arises from the five viscera—why do the five viscera produce turbid *qi*? Because of the five flavors. Each flavor corresponds to a viscus, and each viscus expels its turbid *qi* through the mouth. The six bowels also share this passage, where impurities converge to form turbid *qi*.\n\nHow can one discern turbid *qi*? At night, when sleeping with the mouth closed, the *qi* of the five viscera becomes congested in the throat. Upon waking, open the mouth wide to examine—if there is a foul, putrid odor, this reveals the turbidity and foulness of the *qi*. When the mouth is dry, bitter, or astringent, the cheeks lack saliva, or the throat is sore and unable to eat, these are signs of heat. One must then open the mouth wide and exhale forcefully, following the gates and doors for entry and exit. Exhale ten or twenty times, then \"strike the Heavenly Drum\" (i.e., click the teeth). Click the teeth seven or eight times, swirl the tongue in the Flower Pool (*Huachi*), and swallow the saliva. As the *Huangting Jing* says: *\"Swallow the numinous fluid, and no calamity will approach.\"* This is the meaning.\n\nNext, rely on natural breathing, allowing *qi* to enter and exit freely. Adjust for three or four breaths, then open the mouth wide to exhale. After exhaling, regulate again. Repeat this process until the heat is fully dispelled. How can one know? If *qi* enters through the mouth and exits through the nose, it is reversed (*niqi*); if clear water and sweet nectar arise in the throat, the heat has receded, and the five viscera are cooled. As the *Huangting Jing* states: *\"The Jade Pool’s clear water irrigates the numinous root—if you can cultivate this, you may endure forever.\"* This refers to the sweet nectar and clear water. By constantly regulating and examining these signs, the five viscera will remain free of illness. If one can accurately discern these conditions, the three *qi*-passages will naturally open, and ingesting *qi* will be wholly beneficial, with no effort wasted.\n\n*Qi* is governed by the heart: if the heart is deviant, the *qi* is deviant; if the heart is upright, the *qi* is upright. All movements of the hands and feet, joy and anger, sorrow and happiness, arise from the heart. The heart’s thoughts are all *qi*; *qi* responds to intention, and intention follows the heart. Thus, when *qi* is whole, the body is whole; when *qi* is cut off, the spirit perishes; when the spirit perishes, the body dies.",
      "overlap_context": "ethod. Yet when first ingesting *qi*, one should begin sparingly to ensure smooth passage. Only when the hundred pores open, and with each breath held, sweat permeates the entire body, can one ingest a thousand *qi* without blockage. The *pengpeng* sound indicates obstruction, not smoothness. It yellows the complexion, harms the five viscera, and unsettles the heart.\n\nIt is further said: \"Before the fifteenth day, *qi* exits through the hands; after the fifteenth day, it exits through the feet.\"",

      "translated_text": "Thus, physicians first examine the pulse to observe the five viscera, the four seasons, the correspondence of pulse and *qi*-signs, and thereby discern the source of illness before seeking remedies. Yet if one can merely discern the *qi*-signs, the five viscera will naturally harmonize, the pulse will regulate, and *qi* will flow smoothly.\n\nHow is this known? The five viscera govern the five *qi* and correspond to the five directions. When the visceral *qi* is harmonized, the four seasons follow their natural order. Moreover, if one can examine the mouth and nose, regulating intake and expulsion even for a brief moment, cold and heat will not invade.\n\nThe *Classic* states: *How does one know cold and heat?* Inhalation is singular, while exhalation has six forms. These six are: *yan*, *he*, *hu*, *xu*, *chui*, and *xi*—these are the six *qi*. The six *qi* correspond to the five viscera, with each *qi* governing one viscus, while the remaining *qi* belongs to the three *qi*-passages. *Yan* pertains to the lungs, which govern the nose; if the nose suffers from disharmony of cold and heat, regulate it through *yan* inhalation and exhalation, and it will also treat skin sores. For such ailments, apply the method according to the symptoms. *He* pertains to the heart, which governs the tongue; if the tongue is parched and *qi* is obstructed due to heat, expel it with *he*. For extreme heat, open the mouth wide, but one must act with deliberate moderation—excess will harm the person. *Hu* pertains to the spleen, which governs the central palace of earth; if *qi* is mildly heated and disharmonious, causing abdominal distension, fullness, or stagnant *qi* that cannot be vented, regulate it with *hu*. *Xu* pertains to the liver, which governs the eyes; if the eyes are warm or heated, regulate them with *xu*. *Chui* pertains to the kidneys, which govern the ears; if the lower back and legs are cold, or the yang path is weakened, regulate them with *chui*. *Xi* pertains to the three *qi*-passages.\n\nThough the above broadly outlines this principle, all disharmonies of cold and heat in the five viscera, six bowels, and three *qi*-passages ultimately belong to the heart, which governs *he*. Simply regulate them through inhalation and exhalation, and all illnesses will be cured—there is no need to rely solely on the six *qi* for adjustment.\n\nWhen regulating *qi*, follow the natural passage of entry and exit through the \"gateways.\" If overdone, the throat may become dry; upon sensing dryness, close the mouth and allow *qi* to enter and exit through the nose. This will generate saliva in the mouth, moisten the throat, and one may then swallow it. Further observation: if the mouth is free of foul heat and *qi*, and the five viscera are harmonized, no regulation is needed. Whether walking, standing, or sitting, one may press the tongue against the palate and swallow, and the complexion will glow.\n\nAn ancient *Classic* states: *Absorb the generative* qi *of the midnight hour, and take the six seasonal nodes to guide its ingestion.* At first, the practice may feel intensely hot, and many proceed without order or measure, gradually refining their practice. Yet most people do not comprehend this; they merely follow the method without seeking a teacher’s instruction, mistaking it for the true Way. When they practice, many are harmed—some fall ill, others shorten their natural lifespan. Such cases are too numerous to count. Some claim *qi*-practice yields no benefit, while others say hasty practice is useless. Years pass idly, and when will success come? Or, if one never encounters a true teacher, their resolve wavers, and at the crossroads of doubt, this lifetime is squandered.\n\nNow, to ensure swift attainment of results, I have personally experienced both the harms and benefits of this practice, having spent many years refining it. Both truth and error are now clear. Those who practice hereafter will avoid mistakes, their progress will surpass each day, illnesses will vanish as if by divine intervention, and the effects will be immediate—success or failure evident in an instant.\n\nBeginners often find the three *qi*-passages unopened, causing *qi* to accumulate in the upper regions. If *qi* stagnates, the chest and heart become oppressed, which harms the person. Without knowing how to regulate it, one must proceed with utmost care.\n\nThose new to the practice should first regulate their diet, eating at fixed times and avoiding foods that disrupt the sequence of cultivation. With unwavering sincerity, expel the Three Corpses, relinquish glory and wealth, moderate desires, and distance oneself from riches. Only then can one draw near the Dao, gradually achieving success. Long life and enhanced vitality will not be in vain.\n\nIf one cannot adhere to this, merely knowing it superficially will yield no results. Those who cultivate the true Way fall into three ranks, each adapting to their time and circumstances, and none should cling rigidly to a single method. A brief outline follows:\n\nThe superior practitioner possesses a serene nature, a refined will, and speech aligned with the Dao. Their conduct is flawless. Such individuals carry the legacy of past lives, like a stone cast into water—no comparison suffices. They are akin to those of superior wisdom who awaken early.\n\nThe middling practitioner may hold high office, wield great influence, command vast networks, or aspire to fame and rank. Torn between doubt and resolve, they vacillate, wasting time. Upon hearing the Dao, they are restless even in sleep, their thoughts consumed by it day and night. Their hearts wage war, and the victor prevails. Yet in hesitation, six or seven out of ten are lost. They resemble those of middling wisdom who awaken late.\n\nThe inferior practitioner has let two-thirds of life slip by, their twilight years marked by frailty, their strength and spirit waning. Though they may enjoy wealth like embroidered robes, they are as one walking at night as the sun sets in the west—suddenly, like a candle in the wind. When they recall the Dao, it is as if gnawing their own navel. In stillness, they reflect and sigh deeply. Yet even such as these, if they rouse themselves with determination, may still save one or two out of ten. Those over eighty, however, have their karmic fate sealed, and can only pray for the next life.\n\nThe ancient sages lamented these three ranks to instruct later generations. May those with deep roots and unwavering resolve succeed without regression, attaining boundless fortune and longevity—is this not excellent?\n\nThe practice of ingesting *qi* is fundamentally called *fetal breathing*. *Fetal breathing* resembles an infant in the womb for ten months, growing and maturing without eating. Its bones are delicate, its sinews supple, its grip firm, and it abides in oneness. Having just received the true *qi*, it is free of thought or念, utterly still and serene. It receives the primordial *qi* and transforms, opening its joints and viscera—all is natural. The moment it leaves the womb, it inhales external *qi* and cries aloud, sensing dryness, dampness, and hunger, as if thoughts arise, and the primordial *qi* is lost.",
      "overlap_context": " *qi* will be wholly beneficial, with no effort wasted.\n\n*Qi* is governed by the heart: if the heart is deviant, the *qi* is deviant; if the heart is upright, the *qi* is upright.

      "translated_text": "Now, what people practice as *fetal breathing* is likened to an infant in the womb—this is called *fetal breathing*, the ingestion of internal *qi*. The old scriptures say: \"Drawing external *qi* through the nose is deeply not the correct method.\" For those who wish to practice *qi*-ingestion, choose the time after midnight upon waking from sleep or at dawn upon waking. Follow the previous method of regulating breath and exhalation, assessing the state of *qi* and weather, rinsing and swallowing the numinous fluid. Then lie supine, stretch out the hands and feet, lower the head onto the pillow, and rest. Settle the mind without severing thought, allowing *qi* to flow in and out through the natural gates of respiration. Suddenly close the mouth; once internal *qi* is present, draw it upward into the mouth, gently swell the cheeks, and swallow it downward. Use intention to guide it, then rub the hands over the heart to direct the *qi* downward. Regulate the breath six or seven times, then swallow another *qi*-draft. Follow the previous method, rubbing with the hands. After swallowing twenty *qi*-drafts, pause. At dawn, proceed as convenient—whether sitting or lying down—swallowing over ten more drafts. For each swallow, regulate the breath forty to fifty times, then swallow slowly. Do not swallow hastily unless necessary. Each swallow must be accompanied by hand-rubbing to guide it downward, using intention to send it further down. Observe: if the upper passage is clear, the *qi* will descend past the navel; if not, it will linger in the chest. Wait until mealtime—if the upper passage feels empty and the *qi* flows downward, eat as usual. If not yet hungry, do not eat. When eating, do not become full, for satiety obstructs *qi*-ingestion. After eating, wait until the heart and abdomen feel slightly empty, then ingest twenty more drafts. Repeat this at night after eating, waiting until the heart feels empty before swallowing another twenty drafts. Cease thereafter. Whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, follow this daily regimen for one hundred days.\n\nEach swallow should be spaced by ten breaths—this is optimal. Initially, the three *jiao* are not yet open, and the joints remain closed. Fearful of blockage, do not ingest excessively. Every ten days, increase by three to five drafts until reaching one hundred days. After one hundred fifty days, add another four to five drafts, totaling two hundred. After a full year, the *qi* flows freely, the joints open, the skin becomes supple, and the pores unblock. When the abdomen feels empty, swallow three or five drafts in succession as desired, without fixed limits—though do not exceed three hundred drafts. After three years, the *qi* circulates fully, the five viscera are nourished, the bones and marrow strengthen, and the skin becomes firm and full. Then, the number of swallows is no longer restricted, and even abstaining from grains is possible.\n\nIf, before three years have passed, one first suffers the five taxations and seven injuries, depleting the viscera and bowels, scorching the hundred joints, and cannot gradually repair them—yet abruptly severs the root in hopes of prolonging life—while also failing to sever worldly attachments, remaining entangled in the six senses, wealth, and desire, merely enduring hunger, gradually cutting off grain-*qi*, lacking medicinal nourishment, and inviting new illnesses, then myriad diseases will converge. How can one who thinks to avoid death possibly succeed?\n\nAfter practicing *qi*-ingestion, one must also understand the order of eating. Each morning at mealtime, consume a small portion of bland watery congee to harmonize the spleen-*qi* and replenish bodily fluids. At midday, eat one or two plain calcium cakes or boiled scallion and lotus root soup—avoid consuming anything hot. In the evening, if hungry, boil a small amount of plain calcium! (Note: likely a transcription error for \"cake\" or similar) and rice, cooking them together for thirty to forty boiling cycles before eating. Never eat to fullness; always leave three to five mouthfuls uneaten, maintaining a slight internal emptiness—this is best. A single full meal obstructs the *qi*-pathway, ruining a day’s progress. Strictly avoid greasy, rich foods, raw vegetables, radishes, stale or foul-smelling items, and all meat or pungent foods.\n\nFor the first thirty to fifty days, one may feel slight hunger and cravings. Once the *qi* is regulated and the abdomen gradually moistened, all cravings for flavors vanish. The aforementioned congee, cakes, and the like may be consumed as convenient—there is no need to adhere rigidly to daily schedules. The general dietary order is as follows; choose what is stable and convenient. Occasionally, a meal of watery congee is also excellent.\n\nWhen the three *jiao* first open after practicing *qi*-ingestion, the stomach’s entrance unblocks, the five viscera harmonize, sweet fluids arise, the Jade Pool (mouth) becomes refined, and food tastes sweet—like a convalescent craving nourishment, finding all things delicious. One must exercise restraint; yielding to desire will cause great harm. At the slightest awareness, eat sparingly.\n\nAfter every meal, the food contains toxins and the heat of the five flavors. Immediately after eating, open the mouth and exhale to expel the heat until the warmth in the mouth subsides—this prevents illness. One must also moderate salt and pungent or sour flavors, which should not be consumed. Initially, this may be difficult, but after twenty days, numinous fluids and spiritual springs emerge. If salty or pungent flavors are consumed, the practice of *qi*-ingestion is compromised. Once the five viscera are moistened, the true *qi* descends, expelling all accumulated malign *qi*. As the malign *qi* drains downward, it may harm the stomach. Avoid cold, hot, greasy, raw, or hard foods. If one carelessly consumes even a single mouthful, a slight pain may be felt where the food lodges. With deep practice, one will naturally recognize this afterward. Only consume soft, well-cooked foods—this is essential. After eating, one must exhale as described.\n\nBefore each meal, eat twenty to thirty raw Sichuan peppercorns, then drink water and proceed with the meal. If discomfort arises after eating, consume another twenty peppercorns upon feeling full—this is beneficial. Sichuan peppercorns unblock the three *jiao*, expel malign *qi*, dissolve stagnant food, and guide the true *qi*. If *qi* rises and causes oppression in the chest, hold two or three peppercorns in the mouth—the discomfort will immediately dissipate. The efficacy of Sichuan peppercorns is beyond words.",

      "translated_text": "If sudden fullness, oppression, or *qi* congestion arises, one must sit quietly and regulate the breath—after a short while, the discomfort will disperse and descend. An old text states: \"Secure the *qi* to prevent its descent.\" In the past, beginners adhered to this and restrained their *qi*, but soon their abdomens became distended and agonized, verging on death. There are two passages below that connect upward, through which the mouth and nose exchange breath with the five viscera. If malign *qi* from prior stagnation must be expelled, how can one restrain it? Restraint causes *qi* blockage; blockage leads to pain. Thus, when old *qi* has yet to exit and new *qi* suddenly enters, the two collide and give rise to affliction. One must not restrain it—unobstructed release is optimal.\n\nFurthermore, drinking one or two cups of wine on an empty stomach each day, as inclination allows, is highly beneficial. However, one must not become muddled or oppressed. If one can sip three to five cups daily in a steady stream, it greatly aids the *qi* pathways. The wine must be clear and fine to be suitable; overindulgence should be avoided, for a single bout of vomiting may disrupt *qi* for days. Yet if one wishes to drink more when in high spirits, there is a method: when drinking with ten or five companions, as cups are passed, after each sip, open the mouth and exhale seven or eight breaths to expel the wine’s toxicity. If many cups arrive at once, open the mouth wide and exhale forcefully; if sipping gradually, a gentle exhalation suffices. In ordinary breathing, one may exhale and guide the *qi* outward. If one can persist in this regulation throughout the feast, one who typically drinks three *sheng* may that day drink a *dou*—yet remain uninebriated, avoid the aftereffects of wine, and not lose its flavor, drinking all day without fatigue. Upon waking from sleep, rinse the mouth, swallow saliva, and regulate the breath as usual.\n\nIf *qi* unexpectedly descends at inopportune moments—while eating, in the presence of guests, while riding, before elders or parents—what is to be done? One must seek an opportune moment to release it. If one forcibly restrains a single breath, it will surge upward, churning in the viscera and stomach, causing prolonged pain in the heart and ribs, or even vomiting with chaotic *qi* and oppression. If public or private duties preclude proper care, one should avoid pungent and meaty foods; even if *qi* descends, it will not be foul. After ceasing grain, even one or two releases will be odorless.\n\nMoreover, the *qi* of childbirth and all foul, malign *qi* from severe illness must not be encountered, for they deeply harm the true *qi*. If one must traverse the streets and encounters such malign *qi*, hold the breath and pass through. Otherwise, drink wine to imbue oneself with its *qi*, or consume a small amount of pungent or meaty food—these can also repel it. If malign *qi* has already entered and causes discomfort, regulate the breath to expel it. Furthermore, one must not loudly sing, weep, or shout. If social obligations require condolences, speak softly and avoid excessive weeping.\n\nIf *qi* suddenly surges upward toward the throat, do not allow it to ascend—swallow to force it back down, then inhale and swallow three to five times to settle it. Additionally, massage with the hands to disperse it downward. Holding Sichuan peppercorns in the mouth or drinking wine will also dissipate it. If swallowing proves difficult, do not force it, lest it congest the upper passages. Assess the situation and act accordingly. If the *qi* has not dispersed, do not eat. After eating to fullness, do not swallow, for the food will obstruct its descent and cause illness.\n\nWith each swallow, close the mouth and suspend nasal breathing until the breath steadies. Then, with the mind, guide the *qi* outward and observe its descent along the left side through the twenty-four nodes, each passage audible like water flowing over ridges—distinctly perceptible. If no sound is heard, it indicates stagnation from oily or untimely consumption. If not addressed early, further *qi* practice will compound the issue, inevitably leading to illness—utmost caution is required.\n\nBeginners in *qi* practice often covet quick results and deceive themselves about their *qi*, believing that increasing intake is progress. Daily, they may add ten or twenty breaths, and when feeling stable, further increase to thirty or fifty, gradually escalating, convinced of their advancement. Unaware that the *qi* has not yet flowed smoothly, they instead form blockages. Though illness takes root in the abdomen, the body remains oblivious. As symptoms emerge, they persist in their ways, day by day accumulating until a *qi* ailment solidifies—suddenly afflicting the ribs, which is then difficult to remedy with medicine.\n\nAfter three years of practice, even if one encounters setbacks, no harm will come. Daily *qi* swallowing may reach a thousand gulps without fear. After nine years, the practice will never regress, and the joints will interconnect. As the *Huangting Jing* states: \"A thousand thousand, a hundred hundred, linked in succession; ten by ten, like layered mountains.\" This describes the sinews and bones becoming interconnected. Thus, the five viscera may thereafter enter water without drowning. The inner *qi* does not exit, nor does the outer *qi* enter—even ten or twenty days may pass without issue. Neither extreme cold nor heat will cause fear, and neither age nor youth will be a hindrance.\n\nThe *qi* must be firmly grasped and controlled. Initially, before the *qi* flows, one cannot yet grasp it. After half a year or a hundred days, when the *qi* flows smoothly and the palms sweat, one may then grasp it. The *Huangting Jing* says: \"Seal the three passes, grasp firmly, and halt; rinse with golden nectar and swallow jade blossoms.\" Thus, hunger ceases, the Three Worms perish, the mind remains peaceful, and hearing sharpens.\n\nThe *qi* sea lies below the navel, yet most people’s three passages are blocked. Ordinary breathing does not reach below the navel, and those with hurried, unsteady breath have *qi* that has not descended, lingering in the upper passages of the heart and chest. For beginners who have swallowed *qi* for ten or five days, the upper passage remains unopened. After ten to twenty days, one should perceive the *qi* descending through the barriers and ridges, entering the *qi* sea with a faint, resonant sound—subtly sensing the *qi*’s movement.",
      "overlap_context": "eat twenty to thirty raw Sichuan peppercorns, then drink water and proceed with the meal. If discomfort arises after eating, consume another twenty peppercorns upon feeling full—this is beneficial. Sichuan peppercorns unblock the three *jiao*, expel malign *qi*, dissolve stagnant food, and guide the true *qi*. If *qi* rises and causes oppression in the chest, hold two or three peppercorns in the mouth—the discomfort will immediately dissipate. The efficacy of Sichuan peppercorns is beyond words.",

      "translated_text": "When the *qi* reaches the *qi* sea, it lengthens, and the *qi* condition becomes harmonious and refined.\n\nPrevious texts were not meticulous, merely mentioning prohibitions and taboos, leading many later practitioners to harm their true *qi*, abandoning their practice midway. Since cultivation inevitably involves both gains and losses, I now describe these details again with care.\n\nIn regulating the *qi*, one must attend to its exhalation and inhalation with utmost precision—do not rely on what you hear, for hearing alone will damage the true *qi*. Only when you feel intense heat may you exhale slightly with a *he* breath, but once the heat subsides, you must resume careful regulation.\n\nWhen first swallowing *qi* without knowing how to guide it, take one swallow as a measure: fill the mouth with *qi* by vigorously stirring it, then contract the throat and swallow. After mastering the swallow, once the upper passage opens, there is no need to stir the *qi*; simply close the mouth, hold the breath, and swallow naturally without drawing or expelling *qi*. Swallow three times in succession, then exhale once before swallowing again. Later, swallow eight or nine times before exhaling, or even twenty or thirty times before exhaling. This is when the *qi* descends, reaching the *qi* sea smoothly, and the sinews and vessels become unobstructed.\n\nAt times, intentionally test the length and flow of the *qi* to discern whether it is open or blocked. However, do not always rely on frequent swallowing, for excessive swallowing is not beneficial and disrupts stability. For steadiness, close the mouth and swallow once, directing the *qi* downward with the mind to the *qi* sea. Then swallow again without exhaling—this is the regular practice.\n\nAt first, when unfamiliar with the method, one cannot avoid using the mind to guide the *qi* downward. Later, once you understand the *qi*’s rhythm and sequence, let go of all thoughts and swallow naturally, allowing the *qi* to settle into its proper place without using the hands to press or guide it over the heart.\n\nThe scriptures ask: *Why teach without words?* All things arise yet are not created; they grow yet claim no merit; their work is accomplished yet not possessed. The teaching without words means the mind abides in spontaneity, in non-action and non-thought, nurturing the five viscera and six bowels. \"Growing yet not possessing\" means the *qi* of the Dao is generated within the body, yet the body does not cling to its existence. Success is achieved effortlessly; once accomplished, it is not dwelled upon. External actions are unseen; if seen, others will know. If others know, the self arises; if the self arises, fame follows; if fame follows, misfortune comes; if misfortune comes, the *qi* perishes; if the *qi* perishes, all is lost.\n\nThus, the *Huangting Jing* states: *\"If you can know the One, all things are complete.\"*\n\nRegarding the timing of *qi*-swallowing—midnight, the fifth watch, and three times daily—as well as the sequence of eating, these are fully detailed for beginners. Those deeply versed in the practice will adapt flexibly as circumstances arise; do not cling rigidly to rules. Clinging breeds anxiety, anxiety stirs the heart, and a bound heart leads to labor, which causes progress to regress.\n\nTake heed! Take heed!",

      "translated_text": "The *Scriptures of the Immortals* state: When a person nears death, they begin to cherish their body; once guilt is determined, they think of reforming; when illness has taken hold, they seek medicine—yet the net of Heaven has already been cast, and nothing can be retrieved. Thus, the wise and superior person cherishes life before danger arises, fears misfortune before it strikes, and cultivates health before illness takes root. This is the true superior person, truly called one who preserves and cherishes.\n\nIt is also said that there are three stages of life: the upper years, middle years, and lower years. The upper years span from twenty to thirty, the middle years from forty to fifty, and the lower years from sixty to seventy. Those above eighty have already had their fate determined. In the upper years, one is humble, awakens to the true Dao, comprehends its profound subtleties, possesses a sturdy frame, strong sinews, and full flesh. If one sets their heart upon the Dao and treads its path, there is nothing that cannot be accomplished. In the middle years, awakening to the Dao comes late; sinews, flesh, bones, and marrow are each only half as strong. One stands at a crossroads, and the efficacy of practice is slight. In the lower years, at sixty or seventy, bones, marrow, sinews, and vessels retain only two or three parts in ten. The day is late for practice, yet one may still be saved. For those above eighty, the brain is exhausted, marrow depleted, all passages dried and withered, spirit departed, *qi* vanished—moving like a corpse, walking like a ghost. There is no salvation.\n\nThus, the ancient sages and superior persons, knowing the fragility of life like a candle in the wind, resolutely abandoned worldly toil, cherished their bodies as treasure, and retired to secluded mountains to still their hearts and return to the Dao. The Dao is *qi*; *qi* is the root of the body. As a fish dies when removed from water, a person cannot be whole when separated from the Dao. The cultivation of life lies in refining *qi*; the refinement of *qi* lies in preserving essence. When essence and *qi* are both complete, this is called true treasure.\n\nHumans possess three cinnabar fields: the Upper, Middle, and Lower *Dantian*. The Upper *Dantian* is the *Niwan* brain, also called the \"Imperial Realm\"; the Middle *Dantian* is the heart, also named the \"Crimson Palace Perfected One\"; the Lower *Dantian* is the *Qihai* (Sea of *Qi*), also called the \"Gate of Essence.\" Each of these three fields has its own spirit; if one spirit is deficient, *qi* leaks and essence dissipates. Once dissipated, *qi* scatters. Essence is the root of the body; the root is the seat of *qi*. When essence is complete, *qi* is complete; when essence leaks, *qi* leaks. Only essence and *qi* must be preserved in full.\n\nThe *Huangting Jing* states:\n*\"For long life, be most cautious in the chamber of desire—why invite death and make the spirits weep? If the sea of essence is lost like a hundred streams pouring out, leaves fall and the tree withers, losing its verdant hue.\"*\n\nThus, the ancient sages who aspired to the Dao all cherished *qi* and preserved essence to attain wholeness.\n\nThe method of refining *qi* builds upon the practice of *qi*-swallowing. When time permits, find a quiet room with no one present. Loosen the hair, remove clothing, cover yourself with a blanket, and lie flat on your back. Extend both feet and hands without clenching them. Place a clean mat beside your head, letting it hang down to the ground. Comb your hair thoroughly so it spreads loosely upon the mat. Then regulate your breath. Once the breath is steady, exhale through the mouth. At first, the exhalation may be rapid and labored; regulate it seven or eight times, or up to ten breaths, until the rapid breathing settles. Once settled, refine it again. When time allows, refine it ten times and stop. Initially, if *qi* is not yet flowing smoothly, it may stagnate in the skin—this is undesirable. If there is more time, refine it further, adding five or six more repetitions, gradually increasing to twenty, thirty, or even forty or fifty, with no fixed limit.\n\nWhat is the standard? If one has not practiced *qi*-swallowing for long, but progress is being made, the joints will open and the pores will unseal. When refining reaches twenty or thirty repetitions, the entire body will become moist, and sweat will emerge. This is the sign of efficacy. At first, when *qi* flows smoothly, stop. Gradual sweating is good. Afterward, do not rise too soon or expose yourself to drafts. Like a patient who has just sweated, rest for a long while, then put on clean clothes. Walk slowly in a windless place, speak little to preserve *qi*, reduce activity, and calm the mind. Then the body will feel light, the hundred vessels will flow freely, and the four limbs will be unobstructed.\n\nThus, the *Huangting Jing* states: *\"A thousand disasters vanish, a hundred illnesses heal; one need not fear the ferocity of tigers and wolves. This also reverses aging and extends the years.\"*\n\nFor refining *qi*, one may practice at any convenient time during the night or at noon, whenever the spirit and energy are clear and refreshed. Sit upright and follow the previous sequence diligently, swallowing *qi* frequently. Do not grow lax or careless. If drowsy or sluggish, do not force yourself to sit, for forcing it will invite disorder into the mind. A disordered mind leads to chaotic *qi*, and the true Dao is lost. Initially, when *qi* is not yet stable, drowsiness may arise, but after some time, there will be no more drowsiness.\n\nRefining *qi* need not be done daily. If one has spare time every five or ten days and feels obstructed or restless in the four limbs, practice it. On regular days, to avoid lack of progress, do not practice too frequently.\n\nThe method of releasing *qi*: When cultivating and releasing *qi*, wait until the four limbs are calm and the mind is free of thoughts. Whether sitting or otherwise, let the *qi* follow the natural openings and regulate the breath. Relax the body completely, as if laying down a garment—boneless, fleshless, without spirit or consciousness. Let the heart and ears roam freely. In this state of release, the body becomes as if ownerless, sinking into stillness. Relax the form, release the body, calm the spirit, and refine the *qi*. Then the hundred joints will open, sinews and vessels will flow smoothly, and fluids will circulate. At this point, swallow ten breaths of *qi*, or even up to twenty. With each swallow, remain utterly passive, allowing the *qi* to move without resistance. After a long while, the *qi* will exit through the pores, and no longer need to be expelled through the mouth. Even if ten breaths were taken, only one or two may remain. Then regulate the breath again, taking several dozen or even a hundred breaths. If panting occurs, gently inhale a small amount of *qi* and swallow it, then regulate the breath again.\n\nWhen regulating the breath, the four limbs, skin, flesh, and joints will gradually feel as if bathed. Whenever time permits, do not lie on the back or side. Whether sitting or standing, release the *qi* and relax the body. Practicing this daily will advance one’s progress. Essence will be full, *qi* complete, spirit settled, and the *po* stabilized. The mind will be at ease, thoughts far-reaching, the Dao flourishing, and virtue tranquil. The Three Corpses will vanish, and the Six Dusts will be extinguished.",

      "translated_text": "Thus the *Huangting Jing* states: \"In leisure, with nothing to do, the body is at peace; the dwelling of emptiness lies only in stillness.\" Simply nurture *qi* through non-action, surrendering both body and mind, releasing form and thought, merging with the Dao in unity—then one will naturally perceive the subtle signs. The *Huangting Jing* says: \"Sit upright in non-action, and the hun and po are at peace; in purity, the spirit appears and speaks to me.\" This is what it means.\n\nAs for surrendering *qi*: if one suddenly feels disharmony in the four limbs, blockages in the body, or imbalance in the breath, surrender it—whether lying down or sitting. Calm the spirit, surrender the breath, and focus the mind. In stillness, settle the heart. Over time, as concentration deepens, one will feel the *qi* flowing unimpeded, reaching everywhere.\n\nThe breath-holding method: Those of superior wisdom, with firm resolve and far-reaching thoughts, cultivate themselves without the slightest neglect. Their spirit is settled, their *qi* harmonized, and external illnesses are eradicated. Yet there are those of middling wisdom—perhaps their worldly affairs are unfinished, or their minds waver between progress and retreat. They disregard prohibitions, fail in proper regulation, and their *qi* stagnates, leading to illness. If discomfort arises, enter a quiet room, lie supine, and carefully regulate the breath. Extend the hands and feet, spacing them four or five inches apart. Ensure the bedding is thick and soft; in winter, keep warm with a blanket. Calm the mind, relax the body, then swallow *qi* and immediately hold the breath, keeping the mouth and nose still. Focus the mind on the afflicted area, directing *qi* there with intention. When the breath reaches its limit, exhale, then hold again. After the first exhalation, if the breath is labored, regulate it six or seven times until it flows smoothly, then hold again. Visualize the *qi* attacking the afflicted area—ten, twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty times—until sweat appears and the area feels unblocked, then stop. If not yet resolved, repeat at dawn or night, attacking the area with focused intention until it improves.\n\nIf the illness is in the left hand, direct *qi* straight to the left hand; if in the right, to the right. If in the head, direct it upward. Only when clear results are seen will one know that the mind can command *qi*, and *qi* follows intention, making it as potent as a spirit. Sorrow, joy, grief, and pleasure must not reside in the heart—for sorrow harms the spirit, and excessive joy scatters the will. Follow this method, and no illness will remain unhealed.\n\nThe fasting method: Those who wish to fast must first cultivate as previously described for three years. Once the five viscera are nurtured, the body strong, flesh full, the hundred spirits settled in their places, blood and vessels flowing freely, and the *qi* pathways unimpeded, one will move with increasing lightness each day. At this stage, one gradually ceases to crave the five flavors and loses the desire for food, making complete abstention effortless.\n\nYet some, bound by worldly desires and attachments, cannot sever their cravings. They seek out medical texts and consume herbs to stop eating. At first, the herbs may create a false sense of fullness, but once their effects fade, hunger returns, rendering the effort futile. Constantly preoccupied with herbs, they spend their days seeking the right combinations, ceaselessly driven, exhausting their strength and wit. Troubles multiply, and misfortune may follow. Even with herbs, how can one abruptly sever attachment to food? Some eat fruit to sustain themselves, others consume medicinal substances for satiety—yet is this not merely another form of self-regulation? Why endure the labor of chasing herbs or the toil of decocting them? Year after year, they waste their spirit in vain. How can they hope to reverse aging and return to youth?\n\nTo abstain from grain alone—how can this be called true fasting? Among those of lesser attainment who cannot immediately sever worldly affairs, taking herbs may offer slight benefit. But those of superior attainment do not pursue this path.\n\nFor those who have mastered *qi*-absorption and wish to fast, simply swallow *qi* whenever the stomach feels empty, regardless of time—morning or night—without obstruction. Swallow as needed, without limit, until one naturally senses the right measure. Avoid excessive swallowing, for prolonged practice leads to complete fasting, a process that unfolds naturally and need not be elaborated here.\n\nBeginners may combine herbs with *qi*-absorption, which is also effective. However, those who rely on herbs often neglect *qi*-absorption, making herbs their sole focus. The *Huangting Jing* states: \"The grains’ essence is the earth’s vitality; the five flavors’ external allure reeks of demonic corruption. They disturb the spirit and scatter the fetal *qi*, yet through this, one may reverse aging and return to infancy.\"\n\nFor those in official positions, immersed in worldly glory and burdened by duties, who yearn for the Dao yet cannot still their ambitions—if they spend their years in empty toil, waiting to renounce worldly desires only in old age, how can they firmly cultivate without gradual progress? Such individuals, pressed by public duties and unable to cultivate at the three appointed times, may instead practice at midnight or dawn. Upon waking, they should follow the previous method: rinse the mouth, swallow saliva, regulate the breath, and relax the lower face. When warm, swallow *qi* forty or fifty times, starting with ten or twenty and increasing by five each day, stopping at fifty. Even if official duties arise at daybreak, they should maintain their resolve and cultivate inwardly.\n\n*The Scripture on Regulating Qi of the Great Clarity* concludes.",
      "overlap_context": "ng the breath, the four limbs, skin, flesh, and joints will gradually feel as if bathed. Whenever time permits, do not lie on the back or side. Whether sitting or standing, release the *qi* and relax the body. Practicing this daily will advance one’s progress. Essence will be full, *qi* complete, spirit settled, and the *po* stabilized. The mind will be at ease, thoughts far-reaching, the Dao flourishing, and virtue tranquil. The Three Corpses will vanish, and the Six Dusts will be extinguished.",
