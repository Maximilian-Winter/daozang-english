  "full_translation": "**The Rhapsody on Capturing the Mysterious**\n\n**Canon Title:** *Rhapsody on Capturing the Mysterious*\nOne scroll, unattributed; likely composed during the Tang or Song dynasties.\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, Methods Category.\n\n---\n\n### **The Rhapsody on Capturing the Mysterious: Returning Elixir**\n\nThe Five Phases revolve in cycle—thus is the wondrous elixir perfected!\nThe *elixir* is firm, casting off softness;\nThe *return* is the end that reverts to the beginning.\nIt steers yin and yang to restrain one another,\nborrows hun and po to seek each other.\nEssence refines and bestows life,\npiercing the Three Clarities through the Qian Horse;\nLuminous tallying with creation,\ncirculating the One Qi through the Kun Ox.\n\nNow, the origin of the Golden Elixir,\nthe master of spirit and qi,\nholds the Dragon and Tiger within Zhen and Dui,\npairs Water and Fire at Zi and Wu.\nOne male, one female,\nharmonizing in three thousand cycles of reproach;\nOne sovereign, one minister,\ndispensing generation and completion through the Nine Fives.\nThe petty recites: Mao and You as guards,\nLi and Kan as glory.\nIt grinds ascent and descent within the Eight Trigrams,\ninvestigates compliance and conquest among the Five Phases.\nWithin the dark ford,\nit observes non-being become being;\nWithin the void and nothingness,\nit attains heaviness to become light.\nOne serves as root and origin,\nanother as attendant and follower.\nRelying on the Yellow Sovereign for union,\ndepending on gold and silver for efficacy.\n\nThe depths of the divine chamber,\nfour seasons’ labor ripens in autumn;\nThe outer and inner of the embryo,\neight months’ refinement sows in winter.\nHow could this not be the passion of Heaven and Earth’s intercourse,\nthe union of Sun and Moon to achieve fruition?\nWater must congeal for lead to coalesce,\nmercury must dry for gold to merge.\nCrow and Hare enter the furnace,\nblending into the shell of the parrot’s child;\nWind and cloud enter the tripod,\nechoing the cry of the returned infant.\n\nHow splendid!\nTransforming mortality into immortality,\nreversing age to regain youth.\nYears pass yet remain,\nhills and valleys shift yet grow wondrous.\nThe Three Sovereigns refined their merit to ascend in broad daylight,\nthe assembled sages perfected their practice to receive the purple phoenix’s summons.\nThus, to prolong distant life,\none must rely on the numinous elixir:\nexchange mortal bones for purity,\nforge immortal bones to withstand cold.\nWhen the Purple Mansion and Turtle Palace beckon,\ncranes dance within the tripod;\nWhen the Cinnabar Terrace and Jade Gardens call,\nclouds arise beneath the feet.\n\nTherefore, those who encounter the true wind in past lives,\nwho are born under the mysterious decree,\nlive as long as the Two Rites,\nequal the Three Luminaries in completion.\nGuard the Middle Origin to perfect the Nine Revolutions,\nembrace the One Qi to fulfill the myriad things.\n\n---\n\n### **Dao Gives Birth**\n\nHeaven and Earth embrace transformation—this is their mother!\nVast and boundless,\nprofound and measureless,\nborn from the nameless beginning,\nemerging before the Great Unity.\nInterweaving actions,\nit becomes the mysterious mother of transforming things;\nMisty and pregnant,\nit shapes images before Heaven.\nWater contains its One,\nFire engenders its Two.\nThe movement of the moth’s key births wind,\nyin and yang unite to congeal Earth.\nAt the first division of *tun* and *meng*,\nit spreads the Two Luminaries to create form;\nOnce day and night separate,\nit embodies the Three Powers to establish positions.\nTruly, the Dragon moves through the Nine Fives,\ncirculating in response to the Three Fields.\nThe Eight Trigrams arise from Kun Fire,\nthe Five Phases emerge from Kan’s male.\nWhen the count reaches Lesser Yang,\nit receives Kun and Gen to challenge foes;\nWhen Jia and Yi are fulfilled,\nit encompasses Metal and Wood.\nThus, it emerges and withdraws from the divine furnace,\nrevolves and returns to its dwelling.\nThe Nine Lands dissolve to give life,\nthe Four Seasons alternate to nurture transformation.\nAdapting to seasons and nodes,\nwater and wind follow rain through the Three Fields;\nUniversally moving all beings,\nthe Fire Dragon traverses half the night.\n\nHow could this not be the One Qi’s opening of creation,\nthe Great Yang’s branching?\nThe Sun’s radiance courses beneath the sea,\nthe Moon’s brilliance shines at heaven’s edge.\nWater meets Fire and surges in waves—\nclear and turbid divide;\nMetal attains Wood and becomes Earth—\nred and white reside here.\nReverent indeed!\nEndowed with nature and form,\nappearing through the mechanism of change.\nAt the waxing and waning of the Nine Fives,\nit transforms through the Three Ones.\nScattered as the Seven Treasures,\nit becomes the rare marvel of a prosperous nation;\nCongealed as the Three Flowers,\nit serves as the auspicious omen for saving the body.\n\nThus, when yang reaches its peak, it fills;\nwhen metal flourishes, it wanes.\nThings light and clear then ripen,\nthe elixir dissolves and ceases.\nLead belongs to yang essence,\nreturning to the origin while mercury discards life and death.\nRefining away yin dregs,\ntheir union knows no flourishing or decline.\nTherefore, guard the spirit firmly,\nhold fast to mother and child.\nThree are the elixir’s uses,\nOne is the Dao’s head.\nEach returns to its original birth,\nHeaven and Earth achieve the longevity of the ancients.\n\n---\n\n### **The Source of Dao**\n\nIlluminating the root and sprout,\nrefining to perfect the medicine.\nThe *Source* is the mother of the myriad things,\nthe *Dao* is the name of the image and form.\nDao is conceived through the Source,\nthe Source flourishes through Dao.\nUnheard by human ears,\nit manifests in bestowing life;\nUnseen in daily use,\nit becomes clear through abiding breath.\n\nNow, the origin of Heaven and Earth,\nthe root of father and mother—\nsometimes it responds to the elixir chamber to settle,\nsometimes it points to the Mud Pill to hasten.\nChaos divides form between south and north,\nthe child gestates in the mother’s womb;\nHazy and indistinct, it stirs between floating and sinking,\nyin resides while yang unfolds.\nTruly, cinnabar contains Earth’s po,\nsilver embraces Heaven’s hun.\nWater is the ancestor of the Three Powers,\nessence is the root of primordial qi.\nThe Two Sceneries communicate,\nforming the vessel of the tripod and furnace;\nThe Four Qi surge and contend,\nentering and exiting the Gate of the Mysterious Female.\n\nThus, the Black Tiger and Red Dragon,\nthe blue root and white stem.\nLi and Kan are the ancestral home of Earth,\nEarth and Water are the husband of Metal’s village.\nSnow forms only through water,\nblood arises from metal’s coagulation.\nMercury dries only when meeting lead,\nwater is controlled only by relying on Earth.\n\nHow could this not be the union of yin and yang’s tally,\nthe shared cultivation of creation?\nCranes pursue phoenixes in flight,\ndiligently casting into the nine tripods day by day;\nClouds bestow, rain rushes,\nbreath by breath descending the layered towers.\n\nThus, the Dragon presides over concealment,\ncultivating at the Zi hour.\nThe Four Images congeal into elixir substance,\nthe Three Mercuries merge into lightning’s radiance.\nFirst departing the southern land,\nit forms autumn stone within the furnace;\nFinally returning to the Nine Heavens,\nit crystallizes golden sand upon the sea’s surface.\nOne sees only the dregs of yin washed away,\nthe forging of yang essence.\nThe Nine Revolutions transform and the elixir is complete,\nthe Four Seasons’ work and the Dao is achieved.\n\nHaving nurtured the yellow sprout, it can transmute tile into jade;\nHaving refined the white snow, it reverses age to return to infancy.\n\nThus, the aged endure through heaven and earth,\ntheir bodies fortified by the elixir.\nAscending clouds in a chariot drawn by six dragons,\nthey arrive at will at the vermilion towers of the spirit realm;\nSoaring, they conceal themselves within the celestial gourd,\nwandering freely, their path leads to the azure vastness.\n\n**Dragon and Tiger**\nDragon and Tiger pair in union,\ncast into the golden crucible.\nThe Fire Male aligns with the East,\nthe Earth Female serves as their origin,\ngiving birth in the realm of emptiness,\ndwelling upon the peak of Zhu Rong.\nGenerated in the number three,\nthey form *Li* and thus bear the name *Jia Tiger*;\nVirtue attains the number four,\ntransforming *Yin* and thus called *Geng Dragon*.\nOriginally crowned by the wind of benevolence,\nlife begins with the birth of the Tiger.\nEssence, meeting water, becomes mercury;\nblood, encountering metal, turns to milk.\nFirst named the Sacred Stone,\nscattering like mist into clouds and rosy dawn;\n*Kan* enters Kunlun,\ntrickling like rain into wind and storm.\nIndeed, East and West subdue one another,\nabove and below contend,\nthe two eights brighten to perfection,\nthe Four Images merge at the center.\nNamed after Liu An,\nwho discoursed on autumn stone’s purity;\nTitled for Hua Zi,\nembodying the great roc’s flight.\nThus, form and shadow follow,\nsoul and spirit unite,\nthe crow hides upon Mount Tai,\nthe hare emerges from the Flowery Pond.\nOne is martial,\naiding the pivot of the fire gate;\nOne is civil,\nserving the enlightened sovereign’s cauldron.\nIs this not sinew and bone as vanguard,\nflesh and blood in union?\nReceiving watery lead in the golden crucible,\ndirecting solar essence through the iron ox,\npassing through fire, it takes flight,\nits traces eluding even spirits and gods;\nEncountering the tiger, it congeals,\nits transformations defying heaven and earth.\nThus it flows yet forgets warmth,\nglows yet retains substance,\nfollows the yellow light in transformation,\npursues the spirit turtle in ebb and flow.\nWithin the Three Sovereigns’ palace,\ncrimson snow drifts lightly;\nBefore the Five Emperors’ altar,\nyellow clouds rise in streams.\n\n**Autumn Stone**\nThe solar metal’s body is metaphorically called autumn stone.\n\"Autumn\" derives from its whiteness,\n\"stone\" from its hardness.\nRoaming the principle of ninety thousand,\nborn with the weight of one *jin*.\nOnce metal and water part,\nlead and silver manifest in form;\nMother and child briefly appear,\nblack and white merge in undifferentiated harmony.\nTracing its nature,\nit transforms essence into spirit,\nmeeting yin fire, it first takes flight,\narriving in the metal’s homeland, it turns white.\nFirst departing silver ore,\nit follows the yellow sparrow into the Milky Way;\nScarcely returning to the toad’s palace,\nit drifts with the pure wind along earth’s veins.\nIndeed, to dry the clear mercury,\nmetal relies on white gold.\nThe child yearns for and clings to the mother,\nyang seeks purity by shedding yin,\nwealth fills and treasures overflow—\nthe immortal’s method of restraint and mastery.\nWhen essence reaches completion, who worries of loss or gain?\n\nWondrous!\nAt midnight’s center, the first yang stirs,\nred and white reflect one another,\ntrue water circulates, purifying the depths.\nReturning through the tail’s cavern,\nas if brewing lead’s flowing form,\nby the center, it has become the purple gold’s body.\nIs this not the mother of primordial qi,\nthe essence of the five flavors?\nTaking the treasure of horse’s teeth,\nit establishes the name *knife-point*.\nTo wed the Alchemist Lord,\none must seek harmony with descendants;\nTo marry the Willow Maiden,\none must rely on the matchmaker’s art.\nThus, to preserve metal’s birth,\nfirst refine the plain and pure.\nMercury, meeting lead, does not rise;\nearth, receiving water, surrenders.\nIts color gleams like jade,\nself-named by King Huai;\nIts nature is swift as a dragon,\nmetaphorically borrowed from Shen Nong.\nBeautiful!\nUtterly pure, utterly refined,\nboth firm and yielding,\nDragon and Tiger balance at *Mao* and *You*,\nyin and yang flourish at mid-autumn.\nLight and clear, it ascends to the muddy pellet,\nits form like a vermilion phoenix;\nHeavy and turbid, it descends from the floral canopy,\nits body like a silvery stream.\nThus, in cultivating the returning elixir,\nvalue arises from metal and stone.\nWhy discard the inner treasure,\nonly to cherish external jewels?\nPity the body’s wholeness between heaven and earth,\nreverted to a dwelling for the Three Corpses.\n\n**River Chariot**\nThe northern primordial qi is named the River Chariot.\n\"River\" borrows the image of the celestial ford,\n\"chariot\" is named for the earth’s axle.\nWater moves only when the wheel turns,\nqi flows only when the chariot advances.\nUpholding rectitude at the center,\ndwelling in earth, it engenders the ten thousand things;\nArriving at the northern position,\nit harmonizes and refines the Three Clarities.\nOriginally, earth lodges in *Li*,\nmetal resides in the North.\nIn elixir-making, it serves for restraint and mastery,\nin things, it holds the virtue of beginning and end.\nWithout fixed position, it congeals as the pivot of transformation;\nWith flowing form, it blends black and white.\nOne source flows into the Three Honored Ones as ancestors,\nthe Four Seas as home,\ndwelling in the abode of the Primordial Rain Lord,\ntraveling in the chariot of the Celestial Matriarch.\nIn cultivating the golden elixir,\nwithout comparison, how to proceed?\nArranging the spirit chamber,\nonly then does the sprout begin to grow.\nThus, it emerges as lead’s form,\nenters as metal’s essence,\nsubduing ghosts below with its softness and moisture,\nrelying on the good matchmaker for union.\nAt times, it removes the old and turbid,\nfaintly dispersing from the layered towers;\nAt times, it circulates the new and clear,\nbreath by breath returning to the central upright.\nIs this not because the turning relies on the pivot,\nsubmission begins at the Milky Way?\nDescending mercury fire into the golden crucible,\ncondensing mist upon the azure waves,\nlight and clear, it scatters as wind and cloud,\nborn within the sea;\nHeavy and turbid, it transforms into flesh and blood,\ndescending from the mountain slopes.\nThough spread across the four directions,\nall return to one flavor.\nTracing the two paths, they converge in the furnace and crucible;\nTaking the three passes, they enter the spleen and stomach.\n\nThe Earth Sovereign follows the axle at *mao* and *you*, thus circulating the flowing pearl;\nThe Flame Emperor pushes the chariot at *zi* and *wu*, receiving the conveyance of harmonious *qi*.\nHow wondrous!\nBestowing life upon the myriad things, nurturing the Five Constants,\nit models itself upon Qian and Kun to establish its principles,\nand accords with the elixir of cinnabar to prescribe its method.\nWhen the twin descents cloud and ascend, I then bear them back to the source sea;\nAs the moon shifts and stars revolve, I then convey them into the cavern chamber.\nThus the dust-laden body is exchanged, the golden bones are readily formed.\nThe Great Dao completes its cycle through the four seasons,\nthe numinous elixir fulfills its work in ten months—\none then knows that the foolish, benighted in their cultivation, advance blindly,\nwhile the worthy, their virtue manifest, attain it as if by pointing to the sun.\n\nThe Five Phases and *yin-yang* essence-*qi* array themselves across the five directions.\nTransforming and nurturing the Five Phases, the utmost essence of *yin-yang*:\nresiding in Heaven, it governs the divisions of the stars;\nanchoring Earth, it earns the names of the sacred peaks.\nTheir prosperity and decline occur in due time,\nthe primordial containing the mother of life and death;\nThe pivot lies in the essential,\ntheir flourishing akin to the workings of creation.\nThough they derive from the Two Modes, all return to one flavor:\nthe Azure embraces the essence of Qian’s yang,\nwhile drawing upon Kun’s *yin* *qi*.\nFire is born in the North, rising to nurture the Three Powers;\nWater grows in the South, descending to arrange the Five Wefts.\nAt a single recitation, it departs from its proper position,\nflowing and infusing the four directions.\nMercury pairs with metal yet does not stir,\nlead, meeting fire, begins to soar.\nA single steed roams in circuit,\nall duly bearing the mandate of the Supreme Emperor;\nThe four substances revolve and intermingle,\nfrom here emerging and vanishing at the center.\nThus the dragon soars in the nine heavens,\nthe phoenix nests in the cinnabar cave.\nThe Kunlun Mountains rise in mist,\nendowed with yang and resembling red lead;\nThe earthly gate births clouds,\nby autumn assuming the form of white snow.\nIs this not because the sun’s course follows order,\nthe Dao proceeds in accord with constancy?\nIlluminating one direction brings clarity without distance,\nperceiving the Five Thieves brings flourishing of itself.\nWhen spirit and *qi* are complete,\nascension occurs here;\nWhen crucible and furnace are prepared,\nunion proceeds thus.\n\nBeginning from the central harmony,\nits position divided into three and five.\nThe four *ming* serve as the realm of nurturance,\nthe five aggregates as the gate of ingress and egress.\nCircling through creation,\nrelying on the mind-steed as matchmaker,\nstep by step forming its shape,\nborrowing watery lead as its master.\nIn the South it pertains to fire,\nin the North to *yin*;\nEstablishing images to distinguish branches and stems,\ndefining its body—who can discern its floating and sinking?\nThe sun restrains the female crow,\nfor in *geng* it sings of *jia* within;\nThe moon harbors the male parrot,\nfor in *mu* it chants of metal concealed within wood.\nThus the configuration coalesces naturally,\nits method flowing and spreading in all directions.\nTaking this as the origin of outer and inner,\nemploying it to harmonize the measures of Heaven and Earth—\nnot yet departed, it still belongs to the gate of life and death;\nawakened and liberated, it surely transcends the path of divine immortality.\n\n**Embryonic Breathing and Qi Absorption** are distinct, yet the inner elixir is thereby perfected.\nThe embryo congeals to form substance,\nbreath gathers to form the elixir.\nThe Five Sprouts complete and gaze longingly,\nthe two *qi* suffice for lingering.\nCirculating through the four limbs,\nthey anchor radiance and bestow luster;\nSwallowed and returned to the six palaces,\nthey support the exterior and interior to bring clarity and peace.\nOriginating from the serene harmony of the primordial,\nfloatingly entering the root of all things—\none may thereby preserve the source of the Dao and begin to esteem it.\nFlaming across the four seas,\nit receives the parents’ primordial essence;\nVast within the three palaces,\nit takes in the upright *qi* of Heaven and Earth.\nTruly, spirit governs *qi*,\n*qi* is endowed and completed by essence.\nThe Mysterious Female is the gate of ingress and egress,\nthe body the city that receives and contains.\nGradually stilling the toil of the dust,\nvaluing the heart-spirit without disorder;\nNext regulating the joints,\ncausing blood and vessels to flow easily.\nThus, seated upright on the bed,\nthe spirit-light gazes inward,\ntaking in the new and clear to make it lustrous,\nexpelling the old and turbid to nourish flourishing.\nFirst departing the earthly gate,\nbreath by breath passing through the layered towers;\nJust entering the heavenly gate,\ncontinuously traversing the three samādhis.\nIs this not because spirit and *qi* harmonize,\nthe human Dao becomes manifest?\nAbundant *qi* follows the transformation of spirit,\nsubtle rain follows the arising of wind.\nStoring below in the Flowery Pond,\nit flows in a fine, misty state;\nClosing and returning to the primordial sea,\nit is swallowed with a gurgling sound.\nHow splendid!\nWhen roots flourish, leaves thrive;\nwhen essence withers, people die.\nStirring the fluids to receive emptily,\nreturning to the original source to attain fullness.\nCongealing within the golden crucible,\ngently forming the shape of a pellet;\nCoalescing toward the barren field,\nturbidly resembling a hen’s egg.\nMoreover, the *yin-yang* crucibles differ,\nmale and female natures are distinct.\nContinuously, *qi* connects the viscera,\nover time, the body becomes like wind and cloud.\nAbiding in the world for long years,\npreserving the rosy complexion with joy;\nReversing old age to regain youth,\nfilling the crimson body with misty radiance.\nThus, to seek the work of transcending the world,\none ingests in accord with the four seasons,\nfollowing inclination as the simurgh chariot leads ahead,\nascending the clouds as the dragon carriage floats to welcome.\nThe body transforms, becoming robust as feathers and wings grow,\n*qi* endures, and celestial fragrance suffuses.\n\n**The Stealing Mechanism**\nWhere there is movement and stillness, the mechanism responds of itself.\nThe thief observes *yin-yang* and may thereby fathom it;\nthe mechanism masters adaptability and reaches all things.\nWhether the handle is large or small, its use is the same;\nwhether the power is dynamic or static, it is likewise so.\nThe worthy perceive it and blessings arrive;\nthe foolish slight it and calamity remains.\nIts method originates from emptiness and nonbeing,\narising from wondrous existence.\nBefore, it is the mechanism that engages things;\nthe heart perceives the thief and extends life.\nBy the decree of King Huai of Chu,\nthe Three Thieves move and the elixir is formed;\nBy the insight of the Yellow Emperor,\nthe myriad things thereby rest in his hands.\nAt a single recitation, it is likened to the primordial image,\narising from a forced name.\nObserving the movements of the spirit-bird,\nembodying the workings of Heaven and Earth,\nanticipating depth and shallowness—\nwhat can be modeled is modeled,\nwhat can be measured in gain and loss is measured.\nThus, the model is manifest in what can be practiced!\nOnly with profound resolve and intent,\nnature and emotions aspiring upward—\nHeaven, when aroused, contains transformation;\nhumans, when aroused, achieve beauty.\nYang ascends, *yin* descends,\nthe workings of spirit emerge with artistry!\nThe hare runs, the crow flies—\nin the heart’s discernment, it is seen!\nIs this not because the mysterious and the yellow are equally attained,\ncreation accords with the mechanism?\nWithout the mechanism, how could one obtain it?\nWithout virtue, the Dao would not be followed.\nAt the gate of Kan’s furnace,\nI peer through the door and enter;\nAt the celestial street and tail cavern,\nI steal the path and return.\n\nHow sublime!\n\nTo steal the \"having\" and steal the \"non-having,\"\nto plunder Heaven and plunder Earth—\nin the Dao, the empty resonance gives rise to the ten thousand things;\nthrough me, its application achieves great beauty.\n\nThe Metal Dragon and Wood Tiger,\ncontracting Heaven and human in subtle completion;\nThe Fire Maiden and Water Man,\nthreading the returning elixir to its origin.\n\nThus, my virtue knows no rest,\nadvancing without retreat—\nthe model of the Three Heroes is not mere wisdom;\nthe worth of the Ten Sages is not mere talent.\n\nThose who grasp the Dao\nmove in harmony with Heaven’s course and equal its function;\nthose who cultivate the body\narrive at divine aid and thus attain it.\n\nHence, good and evil branch into full distinction,\nfortune and misfortune respond accordingly—\nyearning for the blessings of prolonged vision,\ndelving into the fruition of long life.\n\nNine years bearing the exploration of Heaven’s cover and Earth’s support,\nthe merit flutters like simurgh plumes as immortal locks come to greet;\nyears piled upon years bearing the creation of yin and yang,\nriding the crane as jade lads all arrive!\n\nThe *Ode on Capturing the Mysterious* is complete.",
