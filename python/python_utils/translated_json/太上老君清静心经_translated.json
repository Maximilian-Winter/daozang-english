  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Lord Lao’s Scripture on the Pure and Tranquil Mind**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Lord Lao’s Scripture on the Pure and Tranquil Mind*\nAuthor unknown, approximately dated to the Tang dynasty.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Tradition* (Zhengtong Daozang), Taiqing Section.\nAlso found in *Seven Lots from the Bookcase of the Clouds* (Yunji Qiqian), Scroll 17.\n\n---\n\nThe Supreme Lord Lao said:\nThe Dao is fundamentally one of purity and turbidity, one of stillness and movement. Purity and stillness are its root; turbidity and movement are its branches. Thus, yang is pure and yin is turbid; yang moves and yin is still. The male is pure and the female is turbid; the male moves and the female is still. Descending from root to branch, the myriad things are born. Purity is the source of turbidity; stillness is the foundation of movement. If one can attain purity and stillness, the world will hold them in highest esteem.\n\nThe spirit of humanity favors purity, yet the mind disturbs it; the human mind favors stillness, yet desires entangle it. If one can constantly dispel desires, the mind will naturally become still. If one can settle the mind, the spirit will naturally become pure. Then the six desires will not arise, and the three poisons will vanish. Those who cannot achieve this fail because their minds are unsettled and their desires undispelled.\n\nThose who can dispel them observe inwardly the mind—yet the mind has no mind; observe outwardly the form—yet the form has no form; observe afar the things—yet things have no things. When these three are unattainable, only emptiness is seen. Observing emptiness, emptiness too is empty; emptiness has no emptiness. Since there is no \"nothingness,\" even \"no nothingness\" is absent. Profoundly and eternally quiescent, quiescence has no quiescence. Without quiescence, quiescence is absent—all is thoroughly void. How then could desires arise?\n\nSince desires do not arise, the mind is naturally still. With the mind naturally still, the spirit is undisturbed. With the spirit undisturbed, one abides in constant purity and stillness. Abiding in constant purity and stillness, one merges with the Dao. To merge with the true Dao is called \"attaining the Dao.\"\n\nThough called \"attaining the Dao,\" in truth there is nothing attained. Since nothing is attained, it is forcibly named \"attainment.\" For the transformation of sentient beings, the expedient path is opened.\n\nThe Supreme Lord Lao said:\nThe Dao can be attained because it resides within one’s own mind. When the mind attains the Dao, the Dao does not cause attainment. This is the Dao of self-attainment, not to be named \"attainment.\" Thus, it is said that in truth there is nothing attained.\n\nThe Supreme Lord Lao said:\nThe Dao cannot be attained because one perceives a mind. Having perceived a mind, one then perceives a body. Having perceived a body, one then perceives the myriad things. Having perceived the myriad things, attachment arises. With attachment, afflictions arise. With afflictions, deluded thoughts arise. Once deluded thoughts arise, they touch the emotions and lead to confusion, plunging one into the turbid sea, drifting through birth and death, suffering the torments of hell, forever severed from the Dao.\n\nIf one abides in constant purity and stillness, one naturally attains the Dao.\n\nThus, a gāthā is spoken:\n\nThe wondrous workings of the Heavenly Worthy are ever before the eyes,\nEvery movement of body and mind is naturally so.\nCease the moving mind and observe where it moves—\nWhere it moves is boundless, its edges clearly seen.\nYet boundaries, by nature, are fundamentally empty;\nNot by observing the mind is emptiness attained.\nAwakening to causes and conditions as devoid of self-nature,\nOne effortlessly enters the Purple Tenuity Palace.\nWithin and beyond the palace, radiance shines bright;\nThe myriad dharmas, perfect within the One Dao, are level.\nThe pure mind, like a mirror, gleams unobstructed;\nUnobstructed and mindless, the mind is free.\nThe level Dao is equal, without distinction;\nWho then assigns heaven and hell?\nWith the spirit inwardly quiescent, neither lacking nor full,\nGood and evil, like emptiness, have no place to arise.\nOnly because ordinary beings hold divergent views\nDo they forcibly erect divisions upon the earth.\nThough divisions bring a thousand kinds of suffering,\nEach examined closely has no sovereign lord.\nExamining closely, no lord means no origin;\nOnly this dependent arising is the meeting point.\nThough meeting occurs within, it is ever unmet;\nLet go of meeting, practice non-action, and allow things to flow.\nIf there is one who knows the meaning of this scripture,\nWhether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down,\nWho can recite it with sincere mind and deeply uphold it,\nThey will eradicate measureless karmic obstructions and all evil,\nAnd their enemies will attain harmony, free from suffering.\nExternal demons and heterodox paths will be subdued by the Dao.\nTo all sentient beings seeking deliverance from calamity,\nLet each purify themselves and faithfully receive and practice this teaching.\n\n**The Supreme Lord Lao’s Scripture on the Pure and Tranquil Mind concludes.**\n\n\"Those who attain this awakening may transmit the sagely Dao.\"\n\nThe two following passages beginning with *\"Lao Jun yue\"* (The Supreme Lord Lao says) correspond to the section in the *Scripture of Pure Tranquility* that reads: *\"The superior person engages in no contention; the inferior person delights in contention,\"* and so forth, though the wording differs considerably.\n\nThe subsequent verses beginning with *\"Thus, he spoke in gatha\"* do not appear in the *Scripture of Pure Tranquility.*",
