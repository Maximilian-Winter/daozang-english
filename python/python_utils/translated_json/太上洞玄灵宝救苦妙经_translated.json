By chance, his mother had recently passed away, and in his unceasing grief, he daily recited the sutras of his tradition to dedicate merit and repay her boundless kindness.\n\nBy late autumn, a certain Tian, a *gongcao* official for public instruction from Taiping Prefecture, arrived at the monastery to stay. Daozu observed that the official frequently employed the *Tianshu* method to heal the sick and suffering, and possessed the ability to summon and interrogate the souls of the dead regarding their ascent or descent.\n\nWitnessing these numinous wonders, Daozu submitted a petition detailing his plight and beseeching deliverance. The official accepted the petition, stamped it with his seal, and commanded the divine generals to depart. Immediately, they summoned Daozu’s mother to appear before the altar.\n\nThe official asked: “Your brother Daozu recites sutras day and night to dedicate merit on your behalf—why do you remain detained in the netherworld?”\n\nHis mother replied: “Though my son Daozu recites sutras to repay and dedicate merit, his sincerity has not yet been fully realized. If he were to perform the *Six Times Six* meritorious deeds, the dark realms would universally receive its blessings, and I would immediately attain transcendence.”\n\nAt that time, hundreds of men and women were all enduring suffering.\n\nThe official asked again: “What is meant by *Six Times Six*?”\n\nShe answered: “The Yellow Register Water and Land Retreat.”\n\nDaozu wept and said: “Since childhood, I have left my compassionate mother to dwell in the monastic cloister. My personal circumstances remain unfulfilled—how could I muster the resources to accomplish such a great meritorious deed?”\n\nHis mother replied: “It is not so. Simply recite with wholehearted devotion. The Daoist teachings include *The Supreme Sutra of Salvation from Suffering* and the recitation of the sacred name of the Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity’s Salvation from Suffering. The netherworld’s records will be memorialized to the heavens, and merit will swiftly manifest.”\n\nShe added: “The netherworld’s time is pressing—I dare not linger.” Then, she bowed in gratitude and departed.\n\nDaozu immediately entreated the official to transmit *The Supreme Sutra of Salvation from Suffering* and the sacred name of the Heavenly Worthy. Day and night, he recited them with utmost reverence, accumulating a thousand repetitions of each. He composed a memorial, burned it as an offering, and that very night, his mother appeared to him in a dream, saying:\n\n“You have not failed the kindness of my nurture. Your recitation of the sutra and invocation of the sacred name have sincerely moved the lofty perfected ones. By the imperial decree of the Celestial Emperor, I have already been reborn in heaven. From now on, I shall no longer appear to you. You must exert yourself and never forget the true teachings.”\n\nHaving spoken, she ascended upon the clouds and slowly departed.\n\nDeputy Loyalty-Rank Gentleman and Acting Supervisor of Chi Prefecture, Zhao Ziqiu, recounts.",
