  "full_translation": "**The Scripture of the Primordial Heavenly King’s Joy**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Scripture of the Primordial Heavenly King’s Joy*. Author unknown, approximately dated to the Tang dynasty. Purportedly preached by the Primordial Heavenly Venerable to the Nine Qi Heavenly Lords, exhorting kings, queens, and consorts to perform purification rites and cultivate the Dao, thereby safeguarding the peace of their lands. One fascicle.\n\n**Source:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Division, *Benwen* Category.\n\n---\n\n**The Scripture of the Primordial Heavenly King’s Joy**\n\nThe Primordial Heavenly Venerable perfected the lands of the ten directions and delivered all sentient beings. Once the lands were accomplished, he returned to the Great Mystery’s Dark Silence, the Primordial Penetration at the Heaven’s Summit Mountain, the Jeweled Terrace of the Myriad-Light Jade Palace. All perfected beings stood in attendance, and the hosts of heavens assembled. Together with the Supreme Jade Emperor, the Most High Dao Lord, the Sagely Honored Divinities, and the Heavenly Lords and Immortal Sages of all ranks, he reviewed the Dharma Gates, entrusting the thirty-six divisions of true scriptures to the five hundred million heavens of the three thousand worlds. These were to be circulated and taught, enlightening and delivering the celestial and human realms, so that in the future, all men and women might universally plant the roots of faith.\n\nAfter the entrustment was complete, the Nine Qi Heavenly Lords rose from their seats, prostrated themselves, and with raised fists, addressed the Heavenly Venerable: “Since time without beginning, we have revolved through birth and death, guided by karmic conditions, yet always fortunate to encounter the true Dao. The scriptures and teachings have flourished, truly by virtue of the Heavenly Venerable’s boundless salvation. We constantly observe the lower worlds, particularly the realms of Yānlì Heaven, where kings and rulers of nations commit many evils. Some indulge in lust and debauchery, drinking to excess and behaving wildly, neglecting the suffering of their people and inflicting myriad cruelties. Others hunt and fish without restraint, or construct palaces, towers, and fortified cities. Some revel in music and entertainment, galloping through the world, or build grand mausoleums and temples, waging wars in all directions. Others, consumed by malice, murder the virtuous, or heed slander and flattery, rejecting loyalty and righteousness. They impose heavy taxes and corvée labor to sustain their own pleasures, or deny the karmic consequences of past deeds. Some destroy Daoist images, altars, and sacred monasteries, or kill Daoist priests and mountain recluses. Others burn scriptures, slander sages and immortals, or turn father against son in mutual slaughter, or brother against brother in feuds, while kin wage war upon kin. Their grievances ascend to heaven, their tyranny knows no bounds, and the cries of the people are beyond counting. We humbly ask how such beings may be taught. We beseech the Heavenly Venerable to open the gates of great compassion, preach the Dharma, and guide them to the good path.”\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable replied: “All this arises from the karmic conditions of sentient beings. Disbelieving in the consequences of past deeds, they have, for kalpas uncounted, incurred present retribution. Great disasters surge forth—floods, fires, and warfare; seas overturn and mountains collapse; death, famine, and pestilence spread. Fathers are separated from sons, husbands from wives, families torn asunder. Myriad sufferings rage, and the people endure bitter torment. Mountains wail, ghosts weep. Ominous comets streak the sky; the earth quakes, the heavens crumble. Rivers rage, seas boil. Calamities converge, beasts transform into men. Evil qi gives rise to portents; stars manifest omens, warning the world to recognize fortune and misfortune. Yet who among the foolish can awaken? I shall now expound this scripture for you, that all kings may attain joy and their lands enjoy peace.”\n\nThe Nine Qi Heavenly Lords prostrated themselves and entreated: “We pray the Compassionate Venerable will grant us this great mercy and reveal what we have not yet heard.”\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable said: “If the king of a nation, along with his queens, consorts, great ministers, and all virtuous men and women, constantly aspire to take refuge in the true Dao, venerate the Three Treasures, and widely establish fields of merit—erecting monasteries to deliver people, copying scriptures and crafting images, practicing the Dao and performing rites, receiving precepts and observing fasts, making offerings and releasing living beings, repenting and making vows, aiding the destitute and freeing prisoners, pardoning criminals, reducing taxes and corvée labor, abstaining from wine and lust, practicing frugality, cherishing and nurturing the people, laboring for their welfare, frequently arranging seats to lecture on the Great Vehicle, inviting Dharma masters to teach all beings, lighting lamps through the night, scattering flowers and burning incense, reciting scriptures day and night, and petitioning the grotto-heavens, earthly spirits, sacred mountains, and great rivers—then, by establishing immortal monasteries and delivering men and women to the monastic life, protecting and upholding these institutions without cease, the heavens will rejoice, the land will be at peace, the sun, moon, and stars will follow their proper courses, rivers and seas will flow in silence, wind and rain will harmonize, and all will flourish in universal joy.\n\nAt that time, the King of Patient Endurance renounced his palaces and gardens, along with his city walls, the finest places in his realm, and the renowned mountains and forests, establishing sacred monasteries and pure abodes throughout his lands. He selected from among his people men and women of upright appearance, wisdom, and benevolence, and caused them all to leave the household life. All the princes, consorts, nobles, governors, ministers, and great officials who were able likewise entered the Dao, propagating the true Dharma and aiding the nation’s transformation. Moreover, the queens, princesses, princes, ministers, and wealthy elders of the land, following the king’s example, donated their dwellings, gardens, ponds, pavilions, and courtyards to build sacred monasteries, install scriptures and images, and deliver men and women to the monastic life, ensuring their support and protection, that the nation might enjoy peace.\n\nThey constantly crafted images of the Heavenly Venerable’s supreme Dharma-body, the perfected and transformed sages, the divine ranks of immortals, vajra spirit-kings, lion-like guardians, fragrant officials, jade lads and maidens, and the Dragon and Tiger Lords, worshipping and making offerings to them, ever mindful of their presence, aspiring to attain the true Dao and immortal life. They frequently copied the Three Caverns’ scriptures, binding them with silk cords, circulating and reciting them, lecturing and expounding their boundless, wondrous meanings, aspiring to become immortals. They regularly established a hundred seats, inviting Dharma masters to lecture day and night on the Great Vehicle of the Three Caverns, teaching all beings and protecting the people. They constantly observed fasts, performed rites, scattered flowers, burned incense, upheld precepts, and made vows, thereby delivering themselves.”\n\nOften they ransomed the lives of slaves and bondservants, releasing them from lowly stations, and bestowed alms upon the poor. They dug wells along roadsides, planted orchards and groves, constructed dwellings and bridges, delivering all beings and widely spreading compassion. They regularly established charitable fields, distributing clothing and food to relieve hunger and cold. They kept lamps burning through the night to dispel misfortune, aid the light of Heaven, prevent blindness, and universally dissolve darkness.\n\nThey frequently offered Dharma robes, ritual implements, utensils, staffs, food and drink, flowers and fruits, fine incense, and superior medicines to the ten-directional Dharma bodies of renunciates. They constantly presented silks and brocades, cotton and silk fabrics, gold, silver, pearls, and the seven treasures, as well as rare and precious items, carriages, horses, servants, fields, gardens, houses, male and female attendants, wives and concubines, grains, and other provisions to the Three Treasures’ permanent fields of merit.\n\nThey regularly crafted bells and chimes, banners and flowers, canopies and parasols, incense burners, curtains and seats, handkerchiefs and towels, cushions and mats, altars, railings and balustrades, ruyi scepters, dusters for ablutions, sitting mats, and knee rests to offer to scriptures and images, as well as to the Dharma body. They perpetually repaired sacred terraces, halls, pavilions, towers, masters’ quarters, corridors, terraces, kiosks, ponds, and pools—works of towering merit.\n\nThey constantly recited scriptures and invoked the Dao, repenting and praying for blessings to eradicate transgressions. They regularly performed the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Golden Chamber Heavenly Treasure Cavern Perfected Three Primordials ritual, seeking to refine their essence and attain the Dao to become perfected. They frequently practiced the Golden Register ritual, regulating the celestial pivot and correcting the degrees of Heaven to ensure the prosperity of the nation’s destiny. They often performed the Yellow Register ritual to deliver the countless generations of ancestors from the dark prisons of hell. They regularly conducted the Illuminating Perfection ritual to harmonize Heaven and pacify Earth, protecting the nation and bringing peace to the people. They constantly practiced the Natural ritual to universally aid the living and the dead, men and women, the present and the departed. They frequently performed the Numinous Treasure Three Primordials ritual, repenting to Heaven, Earth, Water, and Fire, ransoming the deceased, and liberating themselves. They regularly conducted the Charcoal and Mud ritual to deliver those in distress from calamities—water, fire, blades, and weapons—prisoners in confinement, illnesses, and misfortunes. They often practiced the Cavern Spirit Three Primordials ritual for all beings under Heaven and Earth. They constantly performed the Cavern Abyss Divine Incantation ritual to repel demonic afflictions, all ghosts and spirits, mountain sprites, malevolent specters, epidemics, and pestilences. They regularly conducted the Esoteric Teachings ritual to guide those in peril and suffering, dissolving misfortunes and dispelling disasters. They frequently practiced the Orthodox Unity ritual to prolong life, increase destiny, preserve vitality, and support the infirm. They often performed the Great Peace Cavern Ultimate ritual to still the blades of war and ensure the ripening of the hundred grains. They regularly conducted the Five Refinements ritual to stabilize mausoleums and deliver the deceased.\n\nThey constantly made offerings to Daoist recluses dwelling in mountains to cultivate the true Dao, aspiring to swiftly attain perfection. They frequently cast petitions into mountains and waters, establishing feasts to pray for the great peace of the land. They regularly wielded Orthodox Unity talismans to subdue demons and exorcise ghosts for all men and women. They constantly recited the *Daodejing*, embracing purity and non-action, reducing selfishness and desires.\n\nThey perpetually upheld the Cavern Spirit scriptures’ precepts to restrain wayward spirits and command gods and ghosts. They constantly observed the Cavern Mystery scriptures’ admonitions to purify the three karmas, cleanse the six senses, extinguish thoughts, forget the body, and turn the spirit toward the wondrous. They regularly followed the Cavern Perfection scriptures’ injunctions to darken the mind, still thoughts, and unite with the true Dao. They perpetually practiced the Three Caverns’ great Dharma, cultivating insight and wisdom, attaining quiescence, and returning to the formless.\n\nThey frequently observed the Six Fasts and Ten Abstinences, visiting oratories to burn incense, perform rituals, recite scriptures, lecture on the Great Vehicle, scatter flowers, light lamps, make offerings, and vow for the sake of all beings and themselves. They regularly repaired old images and scriptures, allowing the fragrance of merit to permeate the living and the dead.\n\nOn the fifteenth of every month, they invited venerable Dharma masters to repent, receive precepts, and purify body and mind. They constantly lectured, recited, and expounded the teachings to instruct the people of the nation, inspiring them to awaken the Dao-mind. They perpetually praised and extolled the boundless sagely virtues of the Heavenly Worthy, who shelters and protects all beings.\n\nThey consistently maintained humble dwellings, practicing frugality and self-restraint. They perpetually avoided wine and lust to preserve body and spirit. They constantly practiced benevolence to embrace neighboring states. They regularly cultivated compassion to bring peace and joy to all beings. They perpetually refrained from hunting and fishing, releasing and ransoming lives. They constantly reduced rich flavors, adhering to dietary precepts and fasting. They frequently lessened taxes to relieve the poor. They perpetually avoided conscription, pacifying border regions. They constantly employed gentleness, refraining from corporal punishment.\n\nThe King of Good Forbearance, along with his queen, consorts, great ministers, chancellors, and all the princes and people of the realm—both men and women—constantly practiced such meritorious deeds with diligent vigor, purifying their wisdom, enduring humiliation, upholding precepts, bestowing alms, and observing fasts. Their resolve never waned, and their fame resounded through the crimson heavens. The Heavenly Kings rejoiced and descended in grand procession, accompanied by divine immortals, celestial soldiers, jade maidens, the Five Emperors of the Three Realms, and all mighty spirits. They perpetually guarded and protected the kingdom, where heaven stood still and earth fell silent, the sun and moon shone brightly, the stars aligned in harmony, winds and rains came in due season, the hundred grains ripened in abundance, men and women flourished, the earth yielded its treasures, and dry bones revived. Lifespans lengthened, untimely deaths ceased, and the king, his queen, consorts, ministers, and princes all ascended to heaven in broad daylight, their bodies light as air.\n\nThus, the Four Brahma Perfected Ones transformed the land of Good Forbearance into a Realm of Ultimate Bliss. Let all men and women of future generations diligently strive in this way.\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy perpetually dispatched one hundred Perfected Ones—including the Perfected of Wisdom-Sun, the Perfected of Jeweled Moon, the Perfected of Luminous Farness, the Perfected of Pure Radiance, the Perfected of Heaven-Opening, the Perfected of Life-Throughput, the Perfected of Cultured Virtue, the Perfected of Equal Compassion, the Perfected of Blessed Power, the Perfected of Peaceful Harmony, the Perfected of Empty Tranquility, the Perfected of Vacuous Mystery, the Perfected of Formlessness, the Perfected of Benevolent Wisdom, the Perfected of Pervasive Emptiness, the Perfected of Universal Illumination, the Perfected of Benevolent Farness, the Perfected of Pure Clarity, the Perfected of Limpid Illumination, the Perfected of Equal Insight, the Perfected of Mystic Vision, the Perfected of Great Awakening, the Perfected of Wisdom-Power, the Perfected of Jeweled Treasury, the Perfected of Golden Splendor, the Perfected of Contemplative Farness, the Perfected of Dharma Treasury, the Perfected of Mystic Penetration, the Perfected of Flowing Illumination, the Perfected of Contemplative Wisdom, the Perfected of Great Wisdom, the Perfected of Luminous Form, the Perfected of Utmost Sincerity, the Perfected of Shared Illumination, the Perfected of Purple Radiance, the Perfected of Golden Effulgence, the Perfected of Jade Flower, the Perfected of Numinous Truth, the Perfected of True Emptiness, the Perfected of Cavernous Vacuity, the Perfected of Subtle Wonder, the Perfected of Congealed Mystery, the Perfected of Preserved Aspiration, the Perfected of Steadfast Guarding, the Perfected of Enduring Forbearance, the Perfected of Embracing Mystery, the Perfected of Spontaneity, the Perfected of Namelessness, the Perfected of Awakened Emptiness, the Perfected of Supreme Illumination, the Perfected of Ascending Mystery, the Perfected of Utmost Purity, the Perfected of Perfect Dao, the Perfected of Mystic Unity, the Perfected of Original Boundary, the Perfected of True Unity, the Perfected of Jade Splendor, the Perfected of Tranquil Wisdom, the Perfected of Longevity, the Perfected of Pure Emptiness, the Perfected of Illuminated Dao, the Perfected of Jeweled Origin, the Perfected of Solitary Awakening, the Perfected of Dharma Ocean, the Perfected of Limpid Clarity, the Perfected of Jeweled Form, the Perfected of Seeing Emptiness, the Perfected of Fourfold Attainment, the Perfected of Eightfold Illumination, the Perfected of Ninefold Transformation, the Perfected of Threefold Wheel, the Perfected of Sixfold Penetration, the Perfected of Sevenfold Awakening, the Perfected of Single Form, the Perfected of Dual Modes, the Perfected of Fivefold Wisdom, the Perfected of Tenfold Wheel, the Perfected of Constant Purity, the Perfected of Faithful Virtue, the Perfected of Steadfast Aspiration, the Perfected of Jeweled Truth, the Perfected of Peaceful Aspiration, the Perfected of Penetrating Subtlety, the Perfected of Entering Nonbeing, the Perfected of Dragon Han, the Perfected of Extended Peace, the Perfected of Red Illumination, the Perfected of Opening Sovereignty, the Perfected of Supreme Sovereignty, the Perfected of Jeweled Ocean, the Perfected of Jeweled Fragrance, the Perfected of Fragrant Water, the Perfected of Jade Mirror, the Perfected of Virtue-Water, the Perfected of Dharma-Water, the Perfected of Heavenly Unity, the Perfected of Great Unity, the Perfected of Illuminating Heaven, the Perfected of Vast Dao, and the Perfected of Pervasive Illumination—who rode upon flying clouds and the eight-jade chariots of the cinnabar firmament, adorned with wheel-like jade canopies and feathered parasols. They traversed the void, their divine immortals and celestial soldiers numbering in the countless millions, marching in ordered ranks with banners held high. Their boundless hosts taught and transformed the people of the world, expounding the scriptures and unfolding the numinous sounds, commending good and reproving evil, their names recorded in the heavens.\n\nAll men and women should single-mindedly cultivate fasting and practice the Dao, establishing all manner of good deeds.

      "translated_text": "**The Scripture of the Primordial Heavenly King’s Joy**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Scripture of the Primordial Heavenly King’s Joy*. Author unknown, approximately dated to the Tang dynasty. Purportedly preached by the Primordial Heavenly Venerable to the Nine Qi Heavenly Lords, exhorting kings, queens, and consorts to perform purification rites and cultivate the Dao, thereby safeguarding the peace of their lands. One fascicle.\n\n**Source:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Division, *Benwen* Category.\n\n---\n\n**The Scripture of the Primordial Heavenly King’s Joy**\n\nThe Primordial Heavenly Venerable perfected the lands of the ten directions and delivered all sentient beings. Once the lands were accomplished, he returned to the Great Mystery’s Dark Silence, the Primordial Penetration at the Heaven’s Summit Mountain, the Jeweled Terrace of the Myriad-Light Jade Palace. All perfected beings stood in attendance, and the hosts of heavens assembled. Together with the Supreme Jade Emperor, the Most High Dao Lord, the Sagely Honored Divinities, and the Heavenly Lords and Immortal Sages of all ranks, he reviewed the Dharma Gates, entrusting the thirty-six divisions of true scriptures to the five hundred million heavens of the three thousand worlds. These were to be circulated and taught, enlightening and delivering the celestial and human realms, so that in the future, all men and women might universally plant the roots of faith.\n\nAfter the entrustment was complete, the Nine Qi Heavenly Lords rose from their seats, prostrated themselves, and with raised fists, addressed the Heavenly Venerable: “Since time without beginning, we have revolved through birth and death, guided by karmic conditions, yet always fortunate to encounter the true Dao. The scriptures and teachings have flourished, truly by virtue of the Heavenly Venerable’s boundless salvation. We constantly observe the lower worlds, particularly the realms of Yānlì Heaven, where kings and rulers of nations commit many evils. Some indulge in lust and debauchery, drinking to excess and behaving wildly, neglecting the suffering of their people and inflicting myriad cruelties. Others hunt and fish without restraint, or construct palaces, towers, and fortified cities. Some revel in music and entertainment, galloping through the world, or build grand mausoleums and temples, waging wars in all directions. Others, consumed by malice, murder the virtuous, or heed slander and flattery, rejecting loyalty and righteousness. They impose heavy taxes and corvée labor to sustain their own pleasures, or deny the karmic consequences of past deeds. Some destroy Daoist images, altars, and sacred monasteries, or kill Daoist priests and mountain recluses. Others burn scriptures, slander sages and immortals, or turn father against son in mutual slaughter, or brother against brother in feuds, while kin wage war upon kin. Their grievances ascend to heaven, their tyranny knows no bounds, and the cries of the people are beyond counting. We humbly ask how such beings may be taught. We beseech the Heavenly Venerable to open the gates of great compassion, preach the Dharma, and guide them to the good path.”\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable replied: “All this arises from the karmic conditions of sentient beings. Disbelieving in the consequences of past deeds, they have, for kalpas uncounted, incurred present retribution. Great disasters surge forth—floods, fires, and warfare; seas overturn and mountains collapse; death, famine, and pestilence spread. Fathers are separated from sons, husbands from wives, families torn asunder. Myriad sufferings rage, and the people endure bitter torment. Mountains wail, ghosts weep. Ominous comets streak the sky; the earth quakes, the heavens crumble. Rivers rage, seas boil. Calamities converge, beasts transform into men. Evil qi gives rise to portents; stars manifest omens, warning the world to recognize fortune and misfortune. Yet who among the foolish can awaken? I shall now expound this scripture for you, that all kings may attain joy and their lands enjoy peace.”\n\nThe Nine Qi Heavenly Lords prostrated themselves and entreated: “We pray the Compassionate Venerable will grant us this great mercy and reveal what we have not yet heard.”\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable said: “If the king of a nation, along with his queens, consorts, great ministers, and all virtuous men and women, constantly aspire to take refuge in the true Dao, venerate the Three Treasures, and widely establish fields of merit—erecting monasteries to deliver people, copying scriptures and crafting images, practicing the Dao and performing rites, receiving precepts and observing fasts, making offerings and releasing living beings, repenting and making vows, aiding the destitute and freeing prisoners, pardoning criminals, reducing taxes and corvée labor, abstaining from wine and lust, practicing frugality, cherishing and nurturing the people, laboring for their welfare, frequently arranging seats to lecture on the Great Vehicle, inviting Dharma masters to teach all beings, lighting lamps through the night, scattering flowers and burning incense, reciting scriptures day and night, and petitioning the grotto-heavens, earthly spirits, sacred mountains, and great rivers—then, by establishing immortal monasteries and delivering men and women to the monastic life, protecting and upholding these institutions without cease, the heavens will rejoice, the land will be at peace, the sun, moon, and stars will follow their proper courses, rivers and seas will flow in silence, wind and rain will harmonize, and all will flourish in universal joy.\n\nAt that time, the King of Patient Endurance renounced his palaces and gardens, along with his city walls, the finest places in his realm, and the renowned mountains and forests, establishing sacred monasteries and pure abodes throughout his lands. He selected from among his people men and women of upright appearance, wisdom, and benevolence, and caused them all to leave the household life. All the princes, consorts, nobles, governors, ministers, and great officials who were able likewise entered the Dao, propagating the true Dharma and aiding the nation’s transformation. Moreover, the queens, princesses, princes, ministers, and wealthy elders of the land, following the king’s example, donated their dwellings, gardens, ponds, pavilions, and courtyards to build sacred monasteries, install scriptures and images, and deliver men and women to the monastic life, ensuring their support and protection, that the nation might enjoy peace.\n\nThey constantly crafted images of the Heavenly Venerable’s supreme Dharma-body, the perfected and transformed sages, the divine ranks of immortals, vajra spirit-kings, lion-like guardians, fragrant officials, jade lads and maidens, and the Dragon and Tiger Lords, worshipping and making offerings to them, ever mindful of their presence, aspiring to attain the true Dao and immortal life. They frequently copied the Three Caverns’ scriptures, binding them with silk cords, circulating and reciting them, lecturing and expounding their boundless, wondrous meanings, aspiring to become immortals. They regularly established a hundred seats, inviting Dharma masters to lecture day and night on the Great Vehicle of the Three Caverns, teaching all beings and protecting the people. They constantly observed fasts, performed rites, scattered flowers, burned incense, upheld precepts, and made vows, thereby delivering themselves.”",

Their resolve never waned, and their fame resounded through the crimson heavens. The Heavenly Kings rejoiced and descended in grand procession, accompanied by divine immortals, celestial soldiers, jade maidens, the Five Emperors of the Three Realms, and all mighty spirits. They perpetually guarded and protected the kingdom, where heaven stood still and earth fell silent, the sun and moon shone brightly, the stars aligned in harmony, winds and rains came in due season, the hundred grains ripened in abundance, men and women flourished, the earth yielded its treasures, and dry bones revived. Lifespans lengthened, untimely deaths ceased, and the king, his queen, consorts, ministers, and princes all ascended to heaven in broad daylight, their bodies light as air.\n\nThus, the Four Brahma Perfected Ones transformed the land of Good Forbearance into a Realm of Ultimate Bliss.

They traversed the void, their divine immortals and celestial soldiers numbering in the countless millions, marching in ordered ranks with banners held high. Their boundless hosts taught and transformed the people of the world, expounding the scriptures and unfolding the numinous sounds, commending good and reproving evil, their names recorded in the heavens.\n\nAll men and women should single-mindedly cultivate fasting and practice the Dao, establishing all manner of good deeds. The Perfected Ones descend in grand visitation, overseeing all at once. When incense is burned and flowers scattered, none fail to be noted and heard.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy further dispatched one hundred Divine Lads—including the Wheel-Heaven Lad, the Incense-Bearing Lad, the Bright Jade Lad, the Foremost Illumination Lad, the Seal-Holding Lad, the Dharma-Offering Lad, the Scripture-Attending Lad, the Incense-Presenting Lad, the Flowing Light Lad, the Sun-Canopy Lad, the Moon-Embracing Lad, the Resting Spirit Lad, the Floating Void Lad, the Dragon-Messenger Lad, the Edict-Transmitting Lad, the Life-Commanding Lad, the Hall-Guarding Lad, the Incense-Protecting Lad, the Dharma-Proclaiming Lad, the Pure Chanting Lad, the Dharma-Hearing Lad, the Jade Sound Lad, the Golden Voice Lad, the Bell-Ringing Lad, the Golden Head Lad, the Jeweled Brilliance Lad, the Jade Sun Lad, the Jade Flower Lad, the Merging Mist Lad, the Flying Cloud Lad, the Ascending Void Lad, the Heaven-Climbing Lad, the Pure and Tranquil Lad, the Goodness-Recording Lad, the Incense-Revering Lad, the Wisdom-Head Lad, the Floating Fragrance Lad, the Truth-Embracing Lad, the Talisman-Holding Lad, the Jade Register Lad, the Southern Prosperity Lad, the Vermilion Brilliance Lad, the Red Radiance Lad, the Spirit-Penetrating Lad, the Heaven-Pervading Lad, the Distant Heaven Lad, the Flying Void Lad, the Ninefold Radiance Lad, the Eightfold Wisdom Lad, the Golden Wheel Lad, the Jade Pass Lad, the Heavenly Pass Lad, the Goodness-Recording Lad, the Heaven-Inspecting Lad, the Earth-Inspecting Lad, the Wandering Wheel Lad, the Compassionate Superior Lad, the Sixfold Ability Lad, the Fourfold Nonbeing Lad, the Incense-Welcoming Lad, the Form-Supporting Lad, the Morning Flower Lad, the Jeweled Crown Lad, the Jade Garment Lad, the Void-Riding Lad, the Flying Mist Lad, the Traversing Void Lad, the Void-Sitting Lad, the Canopy-Holding Lad, the Superior Medicine Lad, the Flower-Offering Lad, the Gold and Silver Lad, the Jade Chariot Lad, the Birth-Receiving Lad, the Infant-Nurturing Lad, the Divine Hero Lad, the Blessing Hall Lad, the Numinous Flower Lad, the Phoenix-Dancing Lad, the Auspicious Luan-Dancing Lad, the Transforming Lad, the Dharma-Inquiring Lad, the Scripture-Requesting Lad, the Jade Lad, the Golden Talisman Lad, the Jade Seal Lad, the Jeweled Seal Lad, the Jade Pendant Lad, the Golden Dragon Lad, the Dao-Attaining Lad, the Unobstructed Lad, the Self-Mastering Lad, the Constant Joy Lad, the Lifespan-Extending Lad, the Blessing-Bringing Lad, the Life-Protecting Lad, the Decay-Supporting Lad, the Calamity-Warding Lad, and the Lifespan-Increasing Lad—who perpetually dwelt among humanity, exhorting men and women to uphold fasting precepts, recite scriptures, practice the Dao, perform prostrations and repentance, and cultivate good intentions.
