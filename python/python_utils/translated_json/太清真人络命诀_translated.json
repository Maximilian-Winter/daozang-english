  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Clarity Perfected One’s Scripture on Netting the Destiny**\n\nThe *Scripture of the Supreme Clarity Perfected One on Netting the Destiny* is of uncertain authorship, approximately dating to the Northern and Southern Dynasties. It expounds methods for preserving the body and guarding the spirits. One scroll.\n\n**The Supreme Clarity Perfected One’s Scripture on Netting the Destiny**\n\nThe Yellow and the Old said: The *hun* is not what is called *hun*—it is one’s own ghost. The ghost is the ancestor of man; where there is *qi*, there is *hun*. The *hun* as ghost serves to guard my *hun*. The *po* is my form; man is my *po*. When man dies, the *hun* departs, and the *po* alone remains in the form. The *po* returns to the earth, while the *hun* ascends to heaven. Thus, the *po* is the inner state, and the *hun* the outer state. Those who practice the Dao must know the inner and outer in mutual resonance to commune with the divine luminants. Those who do not know inner and outer will fail; those who do not understand the outer state wander through the five viscera and six bowels, restless day and night.\n\nThe *hun* and *po* are the sun and moon. Why is this said? The Yellow and the Old said: Heaven has sun and moon—these are heaven’s *hun* and *po*. The practice of the Dao is thus: how should one conduct oneself? In heaven, they are sun and moon; in man, they are *hun* and *po*. If one aspires to this, how may one attain the true Dao and rise with heaven? What path leads from the inner state? The outer state is the *hun*; the inner state is the *po*. Guard the outer state at night—thus, guard the *hun*. Guard the inner state by day—thus, guard the *po*.\n\nThe sage said: One yin, one yang—this is called husband and wife, named the Dao. Guarding yang by day—why is this said? At dawn, when the sun rises, the *hun* governs the self; one should use the *hun* to guard the *po*. When the sun sets and the *hun* departs the self, one should use the *po* to guard the *hun*. When the two unite and follow one another, joy arises as yin and yang harmonize in governance. How could one attain anything else? Thus, one yin, one yang—illuminating the union of form and appearance.\n\nThe sun travels by day, the moon by night. Why is the sun called man? The sun and moon, *hun* and *po*, are the solitary spirits of heaven and earth, yet they do not know themselves. In resonance with heaven and earth, they share a single end. The kidneys are the moon, the heart the sun; the liver is the *hun*, the lungs the *po*—it is not so. Heaven illuminates the sun, moon, and stars; the enlightened see life and death, and the moon also has life and death. The sun is the province, the moon the two, and form the three. Thus, the Old Lord said: One generates two, two generates three, and three generates the myriad things. Without self-knowledge, one cannot attain the Dao and cannot give life to the myriad things.\n\nThe moon’s advent is the White Tiger; the sun’s advent is the Green Dragon. Practice the Dao thus—let none be careless. The Yellow and the Old said: The *hun* governs the *po* and form, communicating light with the sun and moon. The essence-spirit abides, yet one does not know the five viscera and six bowels—where lies the first? This is not to transcend the world but to strengthen the form, for the ghost is not a ghost—it is called the human *hun*. The *po* is called my form.\n\nThe *Chart of Divine Immortals* says: I am the Dao. Divided into yin and yang, the Three Spirits reside in the Muddy Pellet. By visualizing and preserving them, one may become a Heavenly Treasure. Formerly, the Dao questioned the spirit: Heaven sent you down to dwell among men, to preserve the body’s form, ensure the essence-spirit does not scatter, the five viscera remain at peace, and the *hun* and *po* abide constantly. Departing from wandering, unwilling to assist the numinous, they drift far away and do not return. Some ascend to heaven, the body dies, the destiny severs, the sound of weeping is heard daily, blood and vessels decay, bones enter the springs. Each must know how to cure illness, where to turn for healing, and how to sit, rise, and conduct the traveling kitchen.\n\nIt is like a great palace—though a thousand *li* away, one need not carry provisions. All attend at one’s side. The pure master bestows great favor—one must exert all effort. The master said: The method for serving the Dao begins with confessing transgressions, petitioning for absolution, repenting errors, correcting oneself, and turning from evil to embrace goodness. Only then may one pay homage to the celestial officials, whose ranks are of ten thousand *shi*, whose emoluments are drawn from heaven’s granaries, who are revered by the Supreme Emperor and honored above kings and marquises. How could one return to evil?\n\nFirst, visualize the Five Beasts. The Five Beasts are the Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior, and Yellow Dragon. Second, traverse the viscera from head to foot, preserving their spirits, nurturing their roots, circulating their *qi*, and invoking their names. Third, guard the Earth One, named the Cinnabar Field, radiant white as snow, its five colors dark and yellow—the abode of the Dao Mother within the Weak Water’s womb. Fourth, guard the Human One, named the Crimson Palace, the Great One of the Southern Culmen, the Red Child and Little Lad, with the sun and moon at its sides, where *hun* and *po* merge. Fifth, guard the Heaven One, the Purple Palace, vast as a chicken’s egg, its five colors blended with yellow, governed by the Twin Ladles, the stars’ calendrical order.\n\nSixth, consume the Cinnabar Field’s elixir, refining life in cycles of three, five, seven, and nine, with the fifteenth day and *jia-wu* as auspicious. Seventh, consume the Golden Fluid, the essence of the Dark Water, at the fifteenth hour, adding midnight. Eighth, consume the layered five-colored golden yellow at dawn, dusk, noon, and midnight. Ninth, consume the Supreme Ultimate’s Purple Cloud, spanning beyond heaven, rising above and below, formless and undifferentiated.\n\nIf you wish to focus on the Three Sections as One, you must know the formed and return to guard the formless. If you wish to preserve the Upper One, yellow as a tangerine, return to preserve the Middle One, red as blood, and guard the Lower One, white as snow. Within it is a divine person, clad in red robes, nine inches tall, crowned with a Nine Virtues’ cap, wearing a green-jade headband, named *Xuxu*. Constantly visualize him, and it will sharpen hearing and vision, enhance the eyes’ essence and light, dispel tears and rheum, and eliminate blindness and fatigue. If overburdened with thought, or if prolonged reading of texts dims the eyes and confounds the heart, appeal to this.\n\nThe liver is wood, located beneath the left flank, its color true green, like a rooster’s comb. Its six lobes suspend the gallbladder within, its color like a blood-filled pouch.\n\nWithin the liver resides a divine person, clad in green robes, eight inches tall, named *Lanlan*. Within the gallbladder is a divine person, three inches tall, dressed in white, named *Huhu*. Constantly visualize them, and it will prevent fright, fear, anger, and joy. If the heart is startled, the gallbladder’s spirit is harmed—visualize the forms of the liver and gallbladder to restore it. Should illness arise from spontaneous joy or anger, or if one acts with fear and dread, appeal to this as well.\n\nThe spleen lies beneath the right flank, aligned with the upper stomach, its color like yellow gold. Within it is a divine person, dressed in yellow robes, six inches tall, named *Bibi*. Constantly visualize him, and it will bring joy without harm, steadiness to men, and tranquility to women. If sorrow or thought harms the spleen’s spirit, visualize the spleen’s form to restore it. Even in grief or pain, meditate upon it to recall the spirit.\n\nThree inches below the liver in the chest is the stomach, its color yellow, governing the fullness of the five flavors. Within it is a divine person, clad in red robes, five inches tall, named *Dandan*. If eating or drinking causes distension, first straighten the abdomen while lying down, stretch the limbs, and fully inflate the belly. Exhale deeply through the mouth, call the spirit’s name, and press downward two inches with the hand—soon it will be cured, for the spirit drives out the qi of food.\n\nThe kidneys reside above the waist, flanking the spine, shaped like crouching rats, wrapped in yellow-white fat, often appearing like large beans, their upper parts black as lacquer. Within the kidneys is a white person, four inches tall, named *Piaopiao*. Constantly visualize him, and it will harmonize yin and yang, preventing deafness. If prolonged listening harms the kidney’s spirit, visualize the kidneys’ form to restore it. Even if hearing fails, appeal to this as well.\n\nTransmit this to later scholars—exert yourselves. In this perilous age, you must cultivate our Way. The light resides in the red practice; within it are nine nines, and the five jades gleam in the Bright Palace. Guarding the One ensures longevity. There is no early or late in studying the Dao—only persistent cultivation. Attaining the Dao is vast and boundless, as if the abdomen holds a treasury. Amidst gold’s accumulation above and below, contemplate the Three Palaces in sitting and rising, never forgetting solitude—long preserve it. The essence of studying the Dao lies in halting idle speech.\n\nWhether unworthy or sagely, each must act for themselves. Embrace harmony with nature, and there will be no missteps. From the noble to the humble, each serves the other—beware of envy toward the divine. Record transgressions, for later errors may begin with a hair’s breadth and diverge by ten thousand miles. The Three Corpses monitor human faults at each month’s end, all stemming from your own heart’s lack of benevolence.\n\nThe spirit says: \"I dwell with humanity, yet it is never sufficient. I think to benefit them, but people themselves neglect their bodies, pushing me away, harming me, humiliating me, wounding me. They restrain me with women, exhaust me with desire, disturb me, abandon me, deceive me, and do not preserve me with the Dao—I, too, abandon them. It rests with each person, not with me.\"\n\nThe Dao asks the spirit: \"When humans are born, whether male or female, all contain the kingly qi of yin and yang. If one wishes to nurture their nature, preserve their essence-spirit, and live long without dying, how should they observe the world?\"\n\nThe spirit replies: \"Humans dwell within, receiving the most revered qi. The four limbs and five viscera each have their own spirits. The heart is red, the lungs white—they interconnect. Those who oppose them die; those who follow them live. Concentrate on the five viscera, call their names, and below, illness is dispelled; above, one becomes an immortal. Only when sincerity is complete can the Way be transmitted.\"\n\nThe spirit says: \"Constantly visualize the left eye as the Crimson Palace, the right eye as the Jade Hall. Within them is a red person, sharpening hearing and vision, allowing night vision as bright as day. When the eyes face wind or sudden illness, rest at dusk, close your eyes, and visualize inwardly to heal. At night, you may illuminate fish; by day, read books.\"\n\nThe spirit says: \"Constantly visualize a five-inch-tall person atop your forehead, clad in five-colored robes. At times, shift your focus three inches before the forehead—its color is true yellow, round as a plate. This grants abundant essence and thought to the forehead, and evil spirits dare not approach.\"\n\nThe spirit says: \"Constantly visualize a person emerging two inches below the nose, dressed in yellow robes, seated upright in a bright chamber. This grants discernment of fragrance and stench, eliminating all blockages and illnesses.\"\n\nThe spirit says: \"Constantly visualize *Shengziming*, and it will stabilize the five viscera, harmonize the blood and vessels, beautify women, and strengthen men.\"\n\nThe spirit says: \"Constantly visualize green light to your left, white light to your right, red light before you, and black light behind you—all converging upon you. Seeing this light ensures it never fades, hence it is called *Changsheng Ziming*.\"\n\nThe spirit says: \"At cock’s crow, visualize the true green of the eastern direction, and focus your intent on your body being true green. From *chen* to *si*, visualize the true red of the southern direction, and focus your intent on your body being true red. From *wei* to *shen*, visualize the true white of the western direction, and focus your intent on your body being true white. From *xu* to *hai*, visualize the true black of the northern direction, and focus your intent on your body being true black. At *wu-ji* hours, visualize true yellow, and focus your intent on your body being true yellow. Do not forget the four seasons, and you will naturally ascend.\"\n\nFor women, focused visualization eases childbirth, regulates menstrual cycles, and prevents yang illnesses.\n\nThe spirit says: \"As for the five viscera, constantly visualize the names of the five viscera within the intestines, and they will flourish. Each viscus has its own abundance: the liver is green, governing the flourishing of the *hun*, containing a green person; the lungs are white, governing the flourishing of the *po*, containing a white person; the heart is red, governing the flourishing of the spirit, containing a red person...\"\n\nThe kidneys are black, governing the flourishing of *zhi*, containing a black person; the spleen is yellow, governing the flourishing of *yi*, containing a yellow person. Thus are the five viscera. Constantly visualize the spirits within them, and one’s abdomen will be free of stagnant blood, accumulations of *qi*, and obstructions in the great muscles, fat, and intestines, ensuring smooth movement of the joints. If a living person has lost their spirit, they may also visualize this to restore it.\n\nThe spirit says: \"Constantly visualize yourself as the Five Jades. The method of the Five Jades: on *jia-yi* days, visualize yourself as green jade; on *bing-ding* days, visualize yourself as red jade; on *wu-ji* days, visualize yourself as yellow jade; on *geng-xin* days, visualize yourself as white jade; on *ren-gui* days, visualize yourself as black jade. Continuously dwell in this visualization with eyes closed, without moving hands, feet, or limbs. After a moment of relaxation, you will suddenly feel as if formless. The spirit will be at peace, no longer wandering afar, and in sleep, you will not suffer from nightmares or malevolent ghosts, for ghosts fear the Five Jades.\"\n\nThe spirit says: \"To pacify the spirit, visualize the Six Dragons. What are the Six Dragons? The liver is the Green Dragon, the lungs are the White Tiger, the heart is the Vermilion Bird, the kidneys are the Dark Warrior, the spleen is the Yellow Dragon, and the gallbladder is the Flying Serpent. The classic says: 'When dragon and serpent unite their essence, firmly guard against desire, and roam with intent.'\"\n\nThe spirit says: \"Every part of a person—face, limbs, five viscera, hands, and feet—possesses spirit, each with its own name and designated domain. For example, the spirit of the nose is called 'Nose'; the spirit of the heart is called 'Heart,' as ordained by the Way of Heaven. Within a single day, one should visualize and retain these spirits, and the bones will become strong, the *qi* abundant, and the strength robust. Without knowing their names, the *hun* and *po* will not know where to enter or exit. If acupuncture or moxibustion is to be applied, first place your hand and say: 'Spirits, all move aside; needle and fire, proceed now. Pursuers, avoid this person.'\"\n\nThe spirit says: \"The throat extends from the root of the tongue downward to the heart, measuring one *chi* in length, entering the heart’s central node like a string of jade rings, countless in number. Within it is a red-clad figure, and on either side stand two spirits guarding it. Constantly visualize this, and you will not forget, nor suffer from coughing or counterflow illness. If you are prone to forgetfulness, focus your attention here.\"\n\nThe liver appears as white silk wrapping pure green, with jade leaves positioned in front, covering the upper half of the heart, and three leaves behind, embracing the heart. Within the lungs resides a spirit, pure white, seven *cun* in height, holding a jade halberd, dwelling among the leaves, named *Chui*. Visualizing this ensures freedom from illness, prevents counterflow vomiting, and grants the complexion the luster of jade. If you see death, flowing blood, foul rats, or other repulsive forms, it means this spirit has been harmed. Constantly recall the form of the lung spirit to restore it. Repulsive forms refer to what the heart finds contrary to its usual purity.\n\nThe heart is fire, its color a radiant red like a flower, broad at the top and narrow below, located above the diaphragm directly between the breasts. Above it is the Flower Canopy; below, the Dipper’s Door; and further below, the realm where the sun and moon roam. The Three Ones reside within a person, glowing like a luminous moon-pearl. Diligently guard them—what more could you seek? To visualize the Earth One, focus on where the sun and moon roam; to visualize the Human One, focus on the Dipper’s Door; to visualize the Heaven One, focus beneath the Flower Canopy. The primordial *qi* flutters and shifts, drawing them together. Within it is a spirit-turtle, majestic and grand. If you wish to know the One, ask me—ask where I reside, and where I am at peace. Not only is there a male One, but also a female One, existing in formlessness, most difficult to know. If you do not know the One, all affairs will fail. It is as large as a pellet, yellow as a tangerine, dwelling in the jeweled chamber of Li Lou’s fine door. When it emerges, it splits in two; when it enters, it becomes one. Radiating like the sun, illuminating all under heaven, if you guard it, all affairs will be accomplished.\n\nThe Lower Cinnabar Field is located two *cun* below the navel, three *cun* in breadth and depth, white above and black below, green on the left and yellow on the right, with a red child at its center like the yolk of a chicken’s egg. The Middle Cinnabar Field is the heart, broad above and narrow below, its center glowing red like fire. Within it resides the Grand One Lord, eight *cun* in height, wearing a red headband. The spirit of the *wu-ji* hall is at the upper edge of the heart, red-white in hue.\n\nThe Upper Cinnabar Field is beneath the Flower Canopy, between the eyebrows, one *cun* inward, where the left is the sun and the right the moon, each half. At its center is the Yellow Elder Lord, with jade lads from the two kidneys attending him, bearing sashes and seals. It is as large as a pellet, yellow as a tangerine. Guard it carefully, lest you lose it. In the jeweled chamber of Li Lou’s fine door, when it emerges, it splits in two; when it enters, it becomes one. Radiating like the sun, illuminating all under heaven, know this and guard it carefully, lest you lose it.\n\nVisualize the stars as follows: beneath the Flower Canopy are three stars covering the Elder Lord. His head is round, symbolizing heaven, his hair long and dark green. His two pupils are square, his eyebrows like drawn bows, his ears spread wide to the four directions, and he wears pendants. His left eye is the sun, his right eye the moon. From the left kidney emerges the Upper Spirit General, seventy-two *zhang* in height, wearing a red headband and grand crown, crimson skirt and red robe. In his right hand, he holds a golden tally, leading three hundred thousand troops clad in red, stationed to my left. From the right kidney emerges the Deputy General, seventy-one *zhang* in height, wearing a red headband and grand crown, crimson skirt and unlined robe. In his left hand, he holds a jade halberd, leading three hundred thousand troops clad in red, stationed to my right. From the spleen emerges the General of the Self, eighty-one *zhang* in height, wearing a red headband and grand crown, crimson skirt and unlined robe. In his left hand, he holds a tally, leading three hundred thousand troops clad in red, stationed before me.\n\nThe *True Transmission of the Great Clarity for Binding Life* is now complete.",

      "translated_text": "Within the liver resides a divine person, clad in green robes, eight inches tall, named *Lanlan*. Within the gallbladder is a divine person, three inches tall, dressed in white, named *Huhu*. Constantly visualize them, and it will prevent fright, fear, anger, and joy. If the heart is startled, the gallbladder’s spirit is harmed—visualize the forms of the liver and gallbladder to restore it. Should illness arise from spontaneous joy or anger, or if one acts with fear and dread, appeal to this as well.\n\nThe spleen lies beneath the right flank, aligned with the upper stomach, its color like yellow gold. Within it is a divine person, dressed in yellow robes, six inches tall, named *Bibi*. Constantly visualize him, and it will bring joy without harm, steadiness to men, and tranquility to women. If sorrow or thought harms the spleen’s spirit, visualize the spleen’s form to restore it. Even in grief or pain, meditate upon it to recall the spirit.\n\nThree inches below the liver in the chest is the stomach, its color yellow, governing the fullness of the five flavors. Within it is a divine person, clad in red robes, five inches tall, named *Dandan*. If eating or drinking causes distension, first straighten the abdomen while lying down, stretch the limbs, and fully inflate the belly. Exhale deeply through the mouth, call the spirit’s name, and press downward two inches with the hand—soon it will be cured, for the spirit drives out the qi of food.\n\nThe kidneys reside above the waist, flanking the spine, shaped like crouching rats, wrapped in yellow-white fat, often appearing like large beans, their upper parts black as lacquer. Within the kidneys is a white person, four inches tall, named *Piaopiao*. Constantly visualize him, and it will harmonize yin and yang, preventing deafness. If prolonged listening harms the kidney’s spirit, visualize the kidneys’ form to restore it. Even if hearing fails, appeal to this as well.\n\nTransmit this to later scholars—exert yourselves. In this perilous age, you must cultivate our Way. The light resides in the red practice; within it are nine nines, and the five jades gleam in the Bright Palace. Guarding the One ensures longevity. There is no early or late in studying the Dao—only persistent cultivation. Attaining the Dao is vast and boundless, as if the abdomen holds a treasury. Amidst gold’s accumulation above and below, contemplate the Three Palaces in sitting and rising, never forgetting solitude—long preserve it. The essence of studying the Dao lies in halting idle speech.\n\nWhether unworthy or sagely, each must act for themselves. Embrace harmony with nature, and there will be no missteps. From the noble to the humble, each serves the other—beware of envy toward the divine. Record transgressions, for later errors may begin with a hair’s breadth and diverge by ten thousand miles. The Three Corpses monitor human faults at each month’s end, all stemming from your own heart’s lack of benevolence.\n\nThe spirit says: \"I dwell with humanity, yet it is never sufficient. I think to benefit them, but people themselves neglect their bodies, pushing me away, harming me, humiliating me, wounding me. They restrain me with women, exhaust me with desire, disturb me, abandon me, deceive me, and do not preserve me with the Dao—I, too, abandon them. It rests with each person, not with me.\"\n\nThe Dao asks the spirit: \"When humans are born, whether male or female, all contain the kingly qi of yin and yang. If one wishes to nurture their nature, preserve their essence-spirit, and live long without dying, how should they observe the world?\"\n\nThe spirit replies: \"Humans dwell within, receiving the most revered qi. The four limbs and five viscera each have their own spirits. The heart is red, the lungs white—they interconnect. Those who oppose them die; those who follow them live. Concentrate on the five viscera, call their names, and below, illness is dispelled; above, one becomes an immortal. Only when sincerity is complete can the Way be transmitted.\"\n\nThe spirit says: \"Constantly visualize the left eye as the Crimson Palace, the right eye as the Jade Hall. Within them is a red person, sharpening hearing and vision, allowing night vision as bright as day. When the eyes face wind or sudden illness, rest at dusk, close your eyes, and visualize inwardly to heal. At night, you may illuminate fish; by day, read books.\"\n\nThe spirit says: \"Constantly visualize a five-inch-tall person atop your forehead, clad in five-colored robes. At times, shift your focus three inches before the forehead—its color is true yellow, round as a plate. This grants abundant essence and thought to the forehead, and evil spirits dare not approach.\"\n\nThe spirit says: \"Constantly visualize a person emerging two inches below the nose, dressed in yellow robes, seated upright in a bright chamber. This grants discernment of fragrance and stench, eliminating all blockages and illnesses.\"\n\nThe spirit says: \"Constantly visualize *Shengziming*, and it will stabilize the five viscera, harmonize the blood and vessels, beautify women, and strengthen men.\"\n\nThe spirit says: \"Constantly visualize green light to your left, white light to your right, red light before you, and black light behind you—all converging upon you. Seeing this light ensures it never fades, hence it is called *Changsheng Ziming*.\"\n\nThe spirit says: \"At cock’s crow, visualize the true green of the eastern direction, and focus your intent on your body being true green. From *chen* to *si*, visualize the true red of the southern direction, and focus your intent on your body being true red. From *wei* to *shen*, visualize the true white of the western direction, and focus your intent on your body being true white. From *xu* to *hai*, visualize the true black of the northern direction, and focus your intent on your body being true black. At *wu-ji* hours, visualize true yellow, and focus your intent on your body being true yellow. Do not forget the four seasons, and you will naturally ascend.\"\n\nFor women, focused visualization eases childbirth, regulates menstrual cycles, and prevents yang illnesses.\n\nThe spirit says: \"As for the five viscera, constantly visualize the names of the five viscera within the intestines, and they will flourish. Each viscus has its own abundance: the liver is green, governing the flourishing of the *hun*, containing a green person; the lungs are white, governing the flourishing of the *po*, containing a white person; the heart is red, governing the flourishing of the spirit, containing a red person...\"",

Thus are the five viscera. Constantly visualize the spirits within them, and one’s abdomen will be free of stagnant blood, accumulations of *qi*, and obstructions in the great muscles, fat, and intestines, ensuring smooth movement of the joints. If a living person has lost their spirit, they may also visualize this to restore it.\n\nThe spirit says: \"Constantly visualize yourself as the Five Jades. The method of the Five Jades: on *jia-yi* days, visualize yourself as green jade; on *bing-ding* days, visualize yourself as red jade; on *wu-ji* days, visualize yourself as yellow jade; on *geng-xin* days, visualize yourself as white jade; on *ren-gui* days, visualize yourself as black jade. Continuously dwell in this visualization with eyes closed, without moving hands, feet, or limbs. After a moment of relaxation, you will suddenly feel as if formless. The spirit will be at peace, no longer wandering afar, and in sleep, you will not suffer from nightmares or malevolent ghosts, for ghosts fear the Five Jades.\"\n\nThe spirit says: \"To pacify the spirit, visualize the Six Dragons. What are the Six Dragons? The liver is the Green Dragon, the lungs are the White Tiger, the heart is the Vermilion Bird, the kidneys are the Dark Warrior, the spleen is the Yellow Dragon, and the gallbladder is the Flying Serpent. The classic says: 'When dragon and serpent unite their essence, firmly guard against desire, and roam with intent.'\"\n\nThe spirit says: \"Every part of a person—face, limbs, five viscera, hands, and feet—possesses spirit, each with its own name and designated domain. For example, the spirit of the nose is called 'Nose'; the spirit of the heart is called 'Heart,' as ordained by the Way of Heaven. Within a single day, one should visualize and retain these spirits, and the bones will become strong, the *qi* abundant, and the strength robust. Without knowing their names, the *hun* and *po* will not know where to enter or exit. If acupuncture or moxibustion is to be applied, first place your hand and say: 'Spirits, all move aside; needle and fire, proceed now. Pursuers, avoid this person.'\"\n\nThe spirit says: \"The throat extends from the root of the tongue downward to the heart, measuring one *chi* in length, entering the heart’s central node like a string of jade rings, countless in number. Within it is a red-clad figure, and on either side stand two spirits guarding it. Constantly visualize this, and you will not forget, nor suffer from coughing or counterflow illness. If you are prone to forgetfulness, focus your attention here.\"\n\nThe liver appears as white silk wrapping pure green, with jade leaves positioned in front, covering the upper half of the heart, and three leaves behind, embracing the heart. Within the lungs resides a spirit, pure white, seven *cun* in height, holding a jade halberd, dwelling among the leaves, named *Chui*. Visualizing this ensures freedom from illness, prevents counterflow vomiting, and grants the complexion the luster of jade. If you see death, flowing blood, foul rats, or other repulsive forms, it means this spirit has been harmed. Constantly recall the form of the lung spirit to restore it. Repulsive forms refer to what the heart finds contrary to its usual purity.\n\nThe heart is fire, its color a radiant red like a flower, broad at the top and narrow below, located above the diaphragm directly between the breasts. Above it is the Flower Canopy; below, the Dipper’s Door; and further below, the realm where the sun and moon roam. The Three Ones reside within a person, glowing like a luminous moon-pearl. Diligently guard them—what more could you seek? To visualize the Earth One, focus on where the sun and moon roam; to visualize the Human One, focus on the Dipper’s Door; to visualize the Heaven One, focus beneath the Flower Canopy. The primordial *qi* flutters and shifts, drawing them together. Within it is a spirit-turtle, majestic and grand. If you wish to know the One, ask me—ask where I reside, and where I am at peace. Not only is there a male One, but also a female One, existing in formlessness, most difficult to know. If you do not know the One, all affairs will fail. It is as large as a pellet, yellow as a tangerine, dwelling in the jeweled chamber of Li Lou’s fine door. When it emerges, it splits in two; when it enters, it becomes one. Radiating like the sun, illuminating all under heaven, if you guard it, all affairs will be accomplished.\n\nThe Lower Cinnabar Field is located two *cun* below the navel, three *cun* in breadth and depth, white above and black below, green on the left and yellow on the right, with a red child at its center like the yolk of a chicken’s egg. The Middle Cinnabar Field is the heart, broad above and narrow below, its center glowing red like fire. Within it resides the Grand One Lord, eight *cun* in height, wearing a red headband. The spirit of the *wu-ji* hall is at the upper edge of the heart, red-white in hue.\n\nThe Upper Cinnabar Field is beneath the Flower Canopy, between the eyebrows, one *cun* inward, where the left is the sun and the right the moon, each half. At its center is the Yellow Elder Lord, with jade lads from the two kidneys attending him, bearing sashes and seals. It is as large as a pellet, yellow as a tangerine. Guard it carefully, lest you lose it. In the jeweled chamber of Li Lou’s fine door, when it emerges, it splits in two; when it enters, it becomes one. Radiating like the sun, illuminating all under heaven, know this and guard it carefully, lest you lose it.\n\nVisualize the stars as follows: beneath the Flower Canopy are three stars covering the Elder Lord. His head is round, symbolizing heaven, his hair long and dark green. His two pupils are square, his eyebrows like drawn bows, his ears spread wide to the four directions, and he wears pendants. His left eye is the sun, his right eye the moon. From the left kidney emerges the Upper Spirit General, seventy-two *zhang* in height, wearing a red headband and grand crown, crimson skirt and red robe. In his right hand, he holds a golden tally, leading three hundred thousand troops clad in red, stationed to my left. From the right kidney emerges the Deputy General, seventy-one *zhang* in height, wearing a red headband and grand crown, crimson skirt and unlined robe. In his left hand, he holds a jade halberd, leading three hundred thousand troops clad in red, stationed to my right. From the spleen emerges the General of the Self, eighty-one *zhang* in height, wearing a red headband and grand crown, crimson skirt and unlined robe.
