  "full_translation": "The Imperially Commissioned *Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n*Masters Section, Volume 14*\n*Annotated Chapters of the* Zhouyi Cantong Qi\n*Daoist Category* · *Abstract*\n\n**[We, your] ministers respectfully note:**\n\nThe *Annotated Chapters of the Zhouyi Cantong Qi* in three juan was composed by Chen Zhixu of the Yuan dynasty. Zhixu, styled Guanwu and self-styled Shangyangzi, began studying the Dao under Zhao Youqin at the age of forty, delving into the arts of divine transcendents and alchemical cultivation. His teachings held that the Way of the Golden Elixir should take the *Yin Fu Jing* and the *Daode Jing* as its foundation, with the *Jinbi Cantong* and *Cantong Qi* as secondary. He further asserted that while many alchemical texts were untrustworthy, those seeking true oral instructions must rely primarily on the *Cantong Qi* and the *Wuzhen Pian*. In his *Poem to Awaken the Eye*, he wrote:\n\n*\"Truly, there exists a formula for long life and immortality—*\n*Yet common folk, their virtue shallow, how could they receive it?*\n*Lead, silver, cinnabar, mercury—each weighed in ounces;*\n*Only with profound power and deep grace did Wei Boyang compose his work.\"*\n\nThus, it is evident that Boyang’s text was his particular object of study.\n\nThis work, his commentary on the *Cantong Qi*, divides the text into thirty-five chapters, differing from Peng Xiao’s edition, which divides it into ninety. He also criticized Xiao for relocating the *\"Song of the Cauldron\"* to the end as improper, instead adhering to the original arrangement by placing it after the *\"Completion of the Symbolic Achievement\"* chapter. His annotations are clear, lucid, and accessible.\n\nRecently, Li Guangdi’s commentary on the *Cantong Qi* has stated that among all versions, the one included in the *Han-Wei Congshu* under Zhu Changchun’s name most closely preserves the ancient intent. Upon collating this with Zhu’s edition, we find that only the opening passage—*\"Qian and Kun are the gate and door of the Changes\"*—lacks chapter titles. Thus, from *\"Qian and Kun Establish Their Positions\"* onward, it is divided into thirty-four chapters, one fewer than this edition. The remaining chapter sequences, however, align entirely with this text. It appears that Zhu’s edition is merely a transcription of this work with its annotations removed, though Guangdi failed to trace its origins.\n\nRespectfully submitted in the third month of the forty-fourth year of the Qianlong reign.\n*Chief Compilers:*\n*Minister* Ji Yun\n*Minister* Lu Xixiong\n*Minister* Sun Shiyi\n\n**Chief Collators:**\n*Minister* Lu Feichi\n\n*Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n*Annotated Division into Chapters of the* Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, Volume I*\n*By* Chen Zhixu *of the Yuan*\n\n**Chapter One: General Introduction to the Great Changes**\n\nQian and Kun are the gate and door of the Changes, the father and mother of all hexagrams. Kan and Li form the encompassing frame, the wheel’s hub and true axle. The four hexagrams of Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li serve as the bellows and key, covering and veiling the Dao of yin and yang—just as a craftsman or charioteer relies on the marking cord, holds the bit and reins, aligns the compass and square, and follows the wheel tracks, abiding in the center to govern the exterior.\n\nNumbers are recorded in the pitch-pipes and calendars; the lunar phases have five or six days. The warp and weft attend the sun, combining to form sixty. Hard and soft have their outer and inner aspects. At dawn, *Zhun* governs affairs; by dusk, *Meng* takes its turn. Day and night each correspond to one hexagram, applied in sequence. Before the month’s end, at the break of dawn, the cycle renews. The sun and moon set the measure; movement and stillness have their early and late phases. Spring and summer occupy the inner body, from *Zi* to *Chen* and *Si*; autumn and winter serve the outer function, from *Wu* to *Xu* and *Hai*. Rewards and punishments respond to spring and autumn; darkness and light follow cold and heat. The line statements embody benevolence and righteousness, issuing joy and anger in accord with the seasons. Thus they correspond to the four seasons and five phases, attaining their principle.\n\nFu Xi beheld the *Hetu* and first drew the eight trigrams. The Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun let their robes hang loose, and the world was ordered—taking Qian and Kun as their model. The *Guicang* of the Xia dynasty made Kun the first; the *Lianshan* of the Shang called Gen the first. The *Zhouyi* of King Wen placed Qian and Kun first. Confucius’ *Wings* says: “Are not Qian and Kun the gate and door of the Changes?” Qian is the yang thing; Kun is the yin thing. It further states: “Qian, in stillness, is concentrated; in movement, it is straight—thus it greatly engenders. Kun, in stillness, is closed; in movement, it opens—thus it broadly engenders.”\n\nMaster Boyang, the Transcendent, deeply grasped the precautions of the Three Sages and composed the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, the supreme wing of the Three Sages’ Dao, guiding the people of myriad generations. Its opening lines directly point: “Qian and Kun are the gate and door of the Changes, the father and mother of all hexagrams.” Master Shangyang said: “Qian, as a thing, is yang—thus it is the door of the Changes. Kun, as a thing, is yin—thus it is the gate of the Changes.” Without the gate and door of Qian and Kun, how could Heaven and Earth establish their positions? How could the sun and moon radiate their light? How could creatures transform and be born? How could the sage enact his Dao?\n\nThus, when Qian moves and straightens, yang arises from the Supreme Ultimate and generates yin. When Kun moves and opens, yin arises from the Supreme Ultimate and generates yang. Yin and yang intertwine to form Li and Kan. Confucius said: “The Changes possess the Supreme Ultimate, which generates the Two Modes. The Two Modes generate the Four Images, and the Four Images generate the eight trigrams.” The function of Qian is nine: first riding Kun to form *Fu*; within *Fu*, *Zhen* is conceived; from *Fu* emerges *Shi*; within *Shi*, *Kan* is conceived; from *Shi* emerges *Qian*; within *Qian*, *Gen* is conceived; from *Qian* emerges *Yu*. *Zhen* is born of *Yu*; *Bi* arises from *Yu*; *Kan* is born of *Bi*; *Bo* arises from *Bi*; *Gen* is born of *Bo*. Thus, the three sons—*Zhen*, *Kan*, and *Gen*—are all conceived within Kun.\n\nThe function of Kun is six: first riding Qian to form *Gou*; within *Gou*, *Pi* is conceived; from *Gou* emerges *Tongren*; within *Tongren*, *Li* is conceived; from *Tongren* emerges *Lü*; within *Lü*, *Dui* is conceived; from *Lü* emerges *Xiaoxu*. *Xiaoxu* gives rise to *Pi*; *Pi* gives rise to *Dayou*; *Dayou* gives rise to *Li*; *Dayou* gives rise to *Guai*. Thus, the three daughters—*Pi*, *Li*, and *Dui*—are all conceived within Qian. Male and female intermingle, mutually relying on one another. When Qian twice joins Kun, *Lin* is formed; from *Lin* emerges *Tai*; from *Tai* emerges *Dazhuang*; from *Dazhuang* emerges *Guai*—this is yang seeking yin. When Kun twice responds to Qian, *Dun* is formed; from *Dun* emerges *Pi*; from *Pi* emerges *Guan*; from *Guan* emerges *Bo*—this is yin responding to yang. This is how Qian generates the three daughters and the three sons. From this point onward, the three sons and three daughters alternately become husband and wife, and the sixty-four hexagrams emerge in sequence. This is what is meant by Qian and Kun being the father and mother of all hexagrams.\n\nWhat is meant by Kan and Li being the frame and enclosure? When yang rides yin, Qian’s center becomes empty and forms Li. When yin rides yang, Kun’s belly becomes full and forms Kan. Thus, Kan and Li succeed the body of Qian and Kun, serving as the frame and enclosure of yin and yang. Their relation to Qian and Kun is like the spokes of a wheel to its hub and axle: Qian and Kun are the true spokes of Kan and Li, while Kan and Li converge at the hub of Qian and Kun. Laozi said: “Thirty spokes share one hub.” This is the same principle as the great and small precautions of Boyang.\n\nThe female and male: the female is the mother of creatures, the male the father of creatures. Thus, the female is the general term for yin things, the male the general name for yang things. Together, Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li are called the four hexagrams of female and male. They serve as the bellows and key, employing yin and yang to bring about growth and decline. The bellows symbolizes the gate of yin and the door of yang, likening Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li to a single bellows and key within Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe Dao of the bellows and key that generates creatures is called *wu*; the Dao of the bellows and key that generates humans is called *ren*; the Dao of the bellows and key that transcends the ordinary and enters sagehood is called *sheng*. The sage is one who skillfully seizes the transformations of creation, skillfully employs Kan and Li. One who skillfully seizes the Dao of creation is like a master craftsman using the inked cord and square to correct the compass—what task cannot be accomplished? One who skillfully employs the Dao of Kan and Li is like holding the reins and bit to follow the wheel tracks—where can one not arrive? The sage holds the cosmos in his hands and gives birth to the myriad transformations within his body.\n\nThe sage excels at abiding in the center to govern the external, illuminating the pitch-pipes and calendrical reckoning to comprehend the numerical patterns. The pitch-pipes respond to the seasonal indications of creation, while the calendar records the revolutions of the celestial sphere. When the first yang arises, the pitch-pipes resonate with the Yellow Bell; from *zi* to *hai*, the celestial degrees complete their cycle, and thus a year is fulfilled as yang is reborn at *zi*. The lunar nodes comprise five or six: the lunar nodes divide two nodes per month, five days make one *hou* (seasonal marker), and six *hou* constitute a month—hence a month has thirty days. A day has twelve hours, and two hexagrams with twelve lines correspond to a day’s warp and weft; a month has sixty hexagrams, forming its inner and outer patterns.\n\nAt the new moon’s dawn, *Zhun* governs affairs, and by dusk, *Meng* assumes reception—why is this? *Zhen* below and *Kan* above form *Zhun*; *Zhen* is the eldest son, capable of reviving the yang within *Kan* to bestow the power of generation, hence *Zhun* governs affairs. *Gen* above and *Kan* below form *Meng*; *Gen* is the youngest son, capable of gathering the yang within *Kan* to enact the function of nurturing warmth, hence *Meng* assumes reception. Day and night each correspond to one hexagram; within the sixty hexagrams, yin and yang mutually bestow generation and nurturance. The dark and new moons mark the beginning and end of a month; morning and evening regulate a day’s movement and stillness. The four seasons determine a year’s rewards and punishments: those who achieve excellence are rewarded, while those who fail in their tasks are punished—never deviating from the proper balance of benevolence, righteousness, joy, and anger. The essential principle of this chapter broadly outlines the unifying thread of the *Cantong Qi*, designating Qian and Kun as the gateways of the *Yi*. It does not merely speak of the elixir, medicinal substances, or firing times.\n\nThis book has been annotated by over a hundred scholars, yet few have deeply penetrated its mysteries. Only Peng Xiao, the True Unity Master, though familiar with the firing process, lacked proper sequence, interpreting each chapter as medicinal substances and firing times, every passage as alchemical crucible work. Some fear later generations may misconstrue it, yet how could the Immortal Elder’s composition contain redundant language? The upper chapter narrates the transformations of yin and yang, refining the Great Elixir; the middle chapter meticulously discusses the return, nurturing, and precautions; the lower chapter models the symbolic forms to reveal the details of elixir completion. The upper chapter proceeds in sequence, while the middle chapter arranges its principles in order—how could they be confused and unexamined?\n\nMaster Shangyang divided and annotated it: the upper chapter into fifteen sections, corresponding to the upper *gua*’s attainment of the elixir; the middle chapter into fifteen sections, corresponding to the lower *gua*’s completion of the elixir; the lower chapter into five sections, corresponding to the completion number of the Five Phases. The divisions of chapters group those with shared intent into single chapters. Following the Immortal Elder’s original intent, the sequence unfolds, borrowing esoteric language to directly point to the elixir’s medicinal substances, firing, crucible, and the four mysteries of creation, enabling later generations to readily grasp and practice, ascending from the ordinary to sagehood, becoming buddhas and immortals. Yet the secrets transmitted heart-to-heart and mouth-to-mouth dare not be committed to writing.\n\nAlas! The virtue and capacity of worldly people are shallow, and slander easily arises. Thus, the ancient sages and great worthies established teachings and transmitted instructions without divulging celestial treasures, scattering them within the classics. King Wen and Confucius mutually affirmed, “The *Zhouyi* clarifies this Dao.” The Yellow Emperor and Laozi mutually affirmed, “The Golden Elixir clarifies this Dao.” Śākyamuni and Bodhidharma mutually affirmed, “The Great Vehicle clarifies this Dao.” The sages, with compassion and skillful means, guide and lead, desiring all to comprehend this Dao—truly the ladder for sentient beings, the bridge for ten thousand generations. How could later people, each clinging to differing views, fail to establish resolute aspiration and seek true teachers, remaining ignorant of yin-yang’s mutual resonance and mutual assistance, each prizing their own hearsay, straying ever further?\n\nThose who see the *Zhouyi* deem it a book of divination and *na jia*, how could they know the Dao of mutual resonance and attaining companionship? Those who encounter discussions of crucibles guess it concerns metallurgy and furnace fires; those who hear of gathering and harvesting guess it refers to the Three Peaks’ sexual arts. Those who hear of effort suspect heterodox paths; those who hear of non-effort suspect sitting in dull emptiness. Those who hear of the Great Vehicle cling to Chan’s empty nature, merely engaging in discourse without examining the sage’s Dao—using yin and yang to cultivate beyond yin and yang, employing worldly methods to cultivate beyond the worldly.\n\nHow could such people discuss the wondrous words within the *Cantong Qi*? Formerly, Wang Chongxi received the Golden Elixir’s instructions from Liu Haichan and attained the Dao, sighing, “No one in the world understands this—only Zhang Pingshu alone.” Pingshu encountered a sagely teacher in Chengdu and composed the *Wuzhen Pian* to instruct later generations, its esoteric language and profound words entirely congruent with the *Cantong Qi*. Master Shangyang, after meeting his sagely teacher, extensively traveled rivers and lakes, broadly seeking and widely gathering—yet all were slanderous talks. The *Cuixu Pian* states: “Later generations still go to study Chan, exposing countless wild fox spirits.” Nowadays, not even one like Pingshu remains—where could one find someone like Chongxi? Yet those who discourse on Chan and nature, flaunting dry wisdom, are everywhere; those who can enter this gate and hear the sage’s Dao are one in a hundred million. Thus, Chongxi’s words reveal great awakening, while Cuixu’s language is pitiable.\n\nThe ancients said: “Those who discuss the Dao are like ox hairs; those who comprehend the Dao are like rabbit horns.” How much rarer are those who practice it? The former worthies said: “Fools do not understand; upon hearing, they greatly clamor. The superior person’s mind is clear; upon hearing, they know the crux.” If one were to ask what this crux is and compare it to the gate of yin and yang, would this not further provoke their猜疑?\n\n**Chapter Two: Qian and Kun Establish Their Positions**\nHeaven and Earth establish their positions, and the *Yi* operates within them. Heaven and Earth are the images of Qian and Kun; establishing positions refers to arranging the positions of yin and yang in mutual pairing. The *Yi* refers to Kan and Li. Kan and Li are the two functions of Qian and Kun. The two functions, without fixed line positions, circulate through the six voids, coming and going without constancy, neither above nor below, ever abiding. Hidden and concealed, they transform within, enveloping the myriad things, serving as the guiding principles of the Dao. Using the insubstantial to regulate the substantial, the utensils employ emptiness. Thus, Kan and Li’s arising and vanishing are not carelessly created; their theories are not idly generated. Drawing evidence, verifying effects, measuring spiritual clarity, and tracing the origins of characters serve as proof.\n\nKan corresponds to *wu* (earth) and the moon’s essence; Li corresponds to *si* (fire) and the sun’s light. The sun and moon are the *Yi*; hardness and softness are balanced. Earth flourishes in the four seasons, weaving through beginnings and ends. Blue, red, black, and white each reside in their directions, all receiving the function of the central palace’s *wu* and *si*.\n\nThe *Ten Wings*’ *Appended Judgments* states: \"Heaven is noble, earth is base; Qian and Kun are thus established.\" The Immortal Elder expounds: \"Heaven and earth set their positions, and the *Yi* operates within them.\" Further annotation says: \"Heaven and earth are the images of Qian and Kun. Setting positions means arranging the positions of yin and yang in harmonious pairing.\" The *Yi* speaks of Kan and Li: Kan and Li are the two functions of Qian and Kun. Though their words are detailed and their intent earnest, how could they expect the world to believe so readily, when fools struggle to comprehend?\n\nThe *Wings* say: \"Dividing yin, dividing yang, alternating softness and hardness—thus the *Yi*’s six positions form a pattern.\" The two functions: Qian employs nine, Kun employs six. There is function but no fixed position. \"Employing nine, one sees a flock of dragons without a leader—auspicious,\" for the noble person practices the Way until virtue reaches its utmost. \"Employing six, it is beneficial to perpetually uphold correctness,\" for Kun’s virtue is the Way of earth, the Way of the wife, the Way of the minister. The Way of earth achieves nothing yet perpetually brings things to completion. Thus, Kun’s function, being solitary yin, accomplishes nothing; only by employing six in accord with Qian does it proceed with the *Yi*’s movement. Qian employing nine matches Kun: \"In the southwest, one gains companions.\" Qian and Kun transform, each rectifying its nature and destiny. Qian’s great beginning, employing nine, rides Kun’s yang, containing its yin emptiness to form Li. Kun’s Great Unity, employing six, bears Qian’s yin, containing its yang fullness to form Kan. Thus, Kan and Li exclusively embody yin and yang in their forms, transforming in function to envelop and nurture life without cease. Like the sun and moon in the sky, swiftly waxing and waning, swiftly cycling through new and full moons; like the yin and yang in the human body, swiftly becoming the Supreme Polarity, swiftly shifting without constancy—the Way of the *Yi* repeatedly changes, never abiding. If Qian and Kun were destroyed, there would be no means to perceive the *Yi*. The sage purifies his heart, retreats, and conceals himself in secrecy, thereby reversing the course of the *Yi*’s Way.\n\nKing Wen’s *Zhouyi* has six lines per hexagram, hence \"six positions form a pattern.\" It also says: \"They flow through the six voids.\" Their coming and going, waxing and waning, are not fixed; their rising and falling, fullness and emptiness, are also without constancy. Thus, Qian initially changes to *Gou*, and through successive changes reaches Kun; Kun initially changes to *Fu*, and through successive changes reaches *Guai*. There are also three sons and three daughters mutually interchanging. Moreover, all sixty hexagrams undergo successive changes, with each hexagram—including the wandering and returning souls—transforming through eight trigrams. There are also cumulative changes, where one hexagram accumulates changes to reach sixty-four hexagrams, and sixty-four hexagrams accumulate changes to reach four thousand ninety-six hexagrams, which then mutually conceive and gestate, each receiving yin and yang to become the ceaseless flux of the world. All this is the Way of yin and yang.\n\nThis qi of the yin-yang Way may lie hidden within the body, or conceal itself within the various forms; it may transform within, enveloping the myriad things, or vigorously enact generation and destruction as the guiding principles of the Dao. Were it not for Qian and Kun’s two functions as the wondrous guiding principles of the Dao, the Dao might well cease to exist. \"Using the insubstantial to regulate the substantial, the utensils employ emptiness.\" Why are \"insubstantial\" and \"substantial\" two distinct things? The division of the Supreme Polarity gives rise to prior Heaven and posterior Heaven. What is prior Heaven? That which is above form is called the Dao, entering the insubstantial from the substantial. What is posterior Heaven? That which is below form is called the utensil, entering the substantial from the insubstantial. Laozi said: \"The nameless is the beginning of Heaven and earth; the named is the mother of the myriad things.\" Hai Chan said: \"From insubstantial to substantial, all are thus; from substantial to insubstantial, how few can achieve it!\" Measuring the functions of Kan and Li’s waxing and waning, posterior Heaven is all utensils—forms, dregs, and substances that wax and wane, arise and vanish. Only prior Heaven possesses the enduring Dao, enabling one to ascend to sagehood.\n\nConfucius said: \"Prior to Heaven, Heaven does not oppose it; posterior to Heaven, it follows Heaven’s timing.\" Ordinary people merely follow the posterior Heaven’s Way, hence they are born and die in endless cycles. The sage skillfully reverses and employs the prior Heaven’s Way, thus attaining knowledge, investigating things, rectifying the heart, and cultivating the self, thereby enduring forever without extinction. \"Counting what has passed follows the sequence; knowing what is to come reverses it\"—thus the Way of the *Yi* is the art of reversal.\n\n\"Words are not carelessly created\": The books of the various masters and hundred schools are composed according to their talents—how could they all be skillful? This is the ancestral book of the Dao; one cannot casually insert a single word for fear of misleading later generations. This is what is meant by \"words are not carelessly created.\" \"Theories are not idly generated\": The Immortal Elder models himself on the Three Sages, aligning with yin and yang and emulating the sun and moon. Moreover, he composed this book in concert with the *Yi* as a ladder and raft for the world. This is what is meant by \"theories are not idly generated.\"\n\nWhat is \"drawing evidence, verifying effects\"? Formerly, the Yellow Emperor ascended to immortality; Chao Fu and Xu You attained transcendence; Laozi transformed the Hu and became a Buddha; in Huainan, even the chickens and dogs became immortals. These are all examples of \"drawing evidence, verifying effects.\" What is \"measuring spiritual clarity\"? Like the sun and moon conjoining in splendor, manifesting on the *gengzi* day—\"spiritual and enlightened, it depends on the person.\" What is \"tracing the origins of characters\"? Like cinnabar being born from the moon, the water trigram Kan; the sun and moon forming the character *yi* at the beginning of the Dao’s completion—this is \"tracing the origins of characters.\" What is \"serving as proof\"? Yin reaches its extreme and becomes yang; yang reaches its extreme and becomes yin. Following yin and yang generates humans and things; reversing and employing yin and yang must produce the yin elixir—this is the \"proof.\"\n\n\"Kan corresponds to *wu* (earth) and the moon’s essence\": The north’s proper position is Kan, which contains true earth—this is the yang earth. The Female constellation governs affairs, concealing the yang essence. *Wu* is its gate; the moon’s hub is its abode. Within, it hides the hornless hare—white inside, black outside—making it yang within yin, outwardly feminine yet inwardly masculine. \"Li corresponds to *si* (fire) and the sun’s light\": The south’s proper position is Li, which contains true earth—this is the yin earth. The Willow constellation governs affairs, concealing the yin light. *Si* is its door; the sun’s wheel is its repository. Within, it hides the three-legged crow—black inside, white outside—making it yin within yang, inwardly feminine yet outwardly masculine.\n\nThe ancients used the sun and moon to form the character *yi*, for *yi* is precisely yin and yang. Yet when one speaks of yin and yang, one does not see *yi*; when one speaks of *yi*, one does not see yin and yang. Moreover, without earth, the myriad things cannot sprout and grow, and the sun and moon especially rely on earth to gestate. Thus, when the sun moves east, it passes through the Di earth; when it moves west, it passes through the Stomach earth; when it travels south, it passes through the Willow earth; when it nurtures in the north, it passes through the Female earth. The sun and moon, receiving earth, endure in their brightness; earth, borrowing the sun and moon, deepens its virtue. Earth’s dominion cycles through the four seasons: spring’s generation, summer’s growth—these are earth’s functions; autumn’s gathering, winter’s closure—these are earth’s powers. Thus, each of the four seasons has its ruling days, and earth long abides in the central palace, weaving through beginnings and ends to fulfill its work. Though blue, red, black, and white each reside in the east, west, south, and north, they all receive the power of *wu* and *si*, the two sevens, to jointly perfect their virtue and enact spiritual transformations.\n\nThis chapter speaks of yin and yang dividing their positions and each residing in its function, necessarily relying on earth. It contains no discourse on tiger, dragon, lead, mercury, metal, water, or the gathering of medicinal herbs. Thus, earlier it speaks of \"arranging yin and yang in harmonious pairing,\" and later it says \"each resides in its direction.\" Other interpretations are not recounted, for the Immortal Elder’s original intent does not involve dividing and adjusting components, causing disorder and mutual annotation, which might lead later readers of this book to say the Immortal Elder is verbose and repetitive, unaware that the wondrous words follow a sequence.\n\n**Chapter Three: The Celestial Bodies of Sun and Moon**\n\nThe *Yi* is imagery; the most luminous of suspended images are none greater than the sun and moon. To exhaust the spirit is to know transformation: when yang departs, yin arrives, their convergence turning like spokes in a wheel, revolving in alternation, emerging and entering, coiling and unfurling. The *Yi* contains three hundred and eighty-four lines, from which hexagrams are drawn—these are the sixty-four hexagrams. From the dark of the moon to the dawn of the new moon, *Zhen* arrives to receive the tally. At this moment, heaven and earth unite their essence, sun and moon clasp and sustain each other: the male yang scatters its numinous radiance, the female yin transforms the yellow womb. Chaos intermingles, the root of power is planted, the foundation laid, nurturing and enclosing, congealing spirit to form the body. All beings tread forth, and even the slightest movement arises from this.\n\nConfucius said: \"Nothing is more vast in adaptability than the four seasons; nothing is more luminous in suspended imagery than the sun and moon.\" The Immortal Elder reiterates and elaborates upon this. This book models its principles on the sun and moon to illustrate yin and yang. The sun and moon adhere to heaven, exhibiting waxing and waning, opposition and union. Yin and yang in the world manifest as compliance and reversal, generation and completion. The sun is the pure yang *qi*, called the Great Yang; the moon is the pure yin essence, called the Great Yin. The celestial sphere spans three hundred and sixty-five degrees and a quarter. Each day and night, heaven completes one revolution, constituting a single day. The Great Yang traverses one degree per day, covering thirty degrees in a month. The Great Yin moves thirteen degrees and a fraction daily, completing one revolution in a month. The sun’s movement of one degree defines a day.\n\nWhat does it mean to \"exhaust the spirit to know transformation\"? Of all spirits, none surpass heaven and earth; of all transformations, none surpass yin and yang. The Dao of heaven revolves leftward, completing one circuit daily, traversing over five hundred and fifty thousand *li*. Earth rests within its *qi*, motionless like a plank floating upon water. The spirit of the Great Yang is the primordial *qi* of heaven and earth. Its body is wholly radiant, and the ten thousand things rely upon its fiery yang *qi*—flaming and red—to grow, mature, and bear fruit. Its diameter spans eight hundred and forty-five *li* with a slight remainder. Its path does not follow the ecliptic or celestial equator but moves within and beyond the ecliptic: when days lengthen, it lies north of the celestial equator; when days shorten, it lies south. Why speak of north and south, inner and outer? Because the Purple Forbidden Enclosure, where the Emperor’s seat resides, lies in the north—thus the north is called \"inner,\" and the south \"outer.\" Its spirit is inexhaustible: such is the spirit of the Great Yang.\n\nThe spirit of the Great Yin is the supreme essence of heaven and earth. Its body is wholly dark, and the ten thousand things rely upon its watery yin transformation to conceive, produce, nourish, and nurture. Its diameter spans six hundred and seventy *li* with a slight remainder. Its path does not follow the ecliptic or celestial equator. The ecliptic and celestial equator resemble two intersecting rings, separated by twenty-four degrees. The moon moves through their midst, deviating from the ecliptic by approximately six degrees. Though its body is dark, it brightens when illuminated by the sun. This is likened to a black lacquered ball hung beneath the eaves: when sunlight strikes it, the ball reflects light onto a distant shadowed wall. The moon’s spherical form, compared to the black lacquered ball, shines where the sun touches it and remains dark where it does not. Thus, it is always half-illuminated and half-obscured. At the full moon, sun and moon oppose each other: at night, the moon is above, the sun below, and the moon’s fully illuminated side faces the world, while its dark side turns toward heaven, unseen by mortals. At the new moon, sun and moon share the same celestial longitude. When the moon waxes, it lies beneath the sun, receiving its light: one side shines toward heaven, the other darkens toward earth. When the moon separates from the sun by twenty-five degrees, its faint glow begins to appear to humanity. As the distance increases, its light grows. When the moon is ninety degrees from the sun, half its light is visible—this is called the first quarter. After the full moon, its light gradually diminishes.\n\nThus, the moon’s body is not inherently round or crescent; it depends on the amount of sunlight it receives. Foolish people may claim that at opposition, the earth obstructs the sun and moon, unaware of the vast height of heaven and the principle that yin and yang *qi* interpenetrate without obstruction. The apparent blemishes in the moon are the shadows of heaven and earth. The sun’s body is large, the moon’s small; the sun is distant from heaven, the moon even more so. Yet the moon’s transformations cannot be fully revealed: such is the spirit of the Great Yin.\n\nThis is what it means to \"exhaust the spirit to know transformation.\" *Zi* is the first of the yang stems, reaching its zenith at *Si*, where yang is extreme and yin begins to arise. *Wu* is the first of the yin stems, reaching its zenith at *Hai*, where yin is extreme and yang begins to arise. Cold and heat alternate, warmth and coolness balance. When yin is at its peak, yang is born; when yang departs, yin arrives. Yin clings to yang as spokes to a wheel, converging and turning. When yin coils, yang unfurls. The *Yi* contains three hundred and eighty-four lines, from which hexagrams are drawn. Each hexagram has six lines, each line three tally-marks. A day comprises two hexagrams, totaling thirty-six tally-marks. Yin and yang intersect not in the span of a single hour, nor do they exhaust the function of a single line. Within an hour, three tally-marks exist, yet only one is employed. The use of a single tally-mark signifies the birth of one yang beneath *Kun*, forming *Zhen*—*Zhen* being one yang that subdues two yins.\n\nThus it is said: \"*Zhen* arrives to receive the tally.\" At this moment, heaven and earth unite their essence, and the ten thousand things, suspended in emptiness, receive life. Sun and moon clasp and sustain each other, the crow and hare intertwined without release. Yang stands firm and masculine, scattering its numinous radiance; yin opens and feminine, transforming the yellow womb to contain and nurture. In the depths of chaos, the two intermingle, the root of power planted, the foundation of the primordial union laid. *Quan* signifies the beginning, *yu* stability. The ancients crafted scales beginning with the *quan* (weight), and carts beginning with the *yu* (chassis). Here, it speaks of the inception of creation. Moreover, *quan* means \"temporary,\" and *yu* means \"stable.\"\n\nHere the text speaks of temporary function requiring utmost stability without rigidity or collapse. It describes the nurturing of the *yin*-*yang* boundary, the congealing of yang essence to form the bodily frame—this passage merely addresses the initial division of the Great Ultimate, the inception of yin-yang’s harmonious flow, and the birth of humanity and the ten thousand things. Thus it states: \"The multitude tread forth, and all that wriggles and moves arises therefrom.\" Yet people fail to recognize that the postcelestial sequence of yin-yang also draws from the metaphor of morning *tun* and evening *meng*, and likewise possesses the root-boundary foundation of *yin* and *yang*. They mistakenly apply this to the elixir crucible’s alchemical workings.\n\nIn the fourth chapter, \"The Sage Observes Above,\" Confucius praises the vast and empty virtue of Primordial Chaos and the Qian-Kun dyad. He traces antiquity back to the era of the Primordial Sovereign, when the *Guanju* first established the rites of cap and marriage, and qi intertwined to sprout the first germ. The sage does not arise in vain—his \"Observing Above\" reveals the celestial tally. The celestial tally advances and retreats, flexes and extends in accord with the seasons. Thus the *Book of Changes* unites with the heart of heaven: the *Fu* hexagram inaugurates the beginning, the sprouting of the eldest son, the *zong* inheriting the father’s body and establishing its foundation through the mother. The waxing and waning respond to the pitch pipes; the rising and falling follow the pivot of the Dipper. On the third day, dawn breaks as *Zhen* receives *geng* from the west; on the eighth day, *Dui* receives *ding*, and the upper *kan* levels like a taut cord. By the fifteenth day, the stem-body reaches fullness as *jia* in the east—the toad and hare, the sun and moon, their essences paired in radiant duality. The toad gazes upon the hexagram’s nodes; the hare spits forth its luminous qi. The seven-and-eight Dao now complete, the path curves downward. On the sixteenth day, the cycle turns as *kun* receives the tally from *xin*, and dawn’s clarity appears. *Gen* aligns with *bing* in the south; by the twenty-third day, the lower *kan* descends. On the thirtieth day, *kun* and *yi* in the northeast lose their companions, the nodes exhausted, the succession passing to the *zong*-body. The dragon of *ren* and *gui* pairs with *jia* and *yi*, Qian and Kun encompassing beginning and end. Seven and eight make fifteen; nine and six likewise correspond. The four combine to make thirty—the yang essence seeks extinction, the eight trigrams arrayed, their luminaries shifting without losing the central origin. Subtle and elusive, their essence is difficult to perceive; one infers and verifies through tallying signs. In dwelling, observe their images; in modeling, imitate their forms. Establish markers as standards, divine auspices to determine fortune. Issue decrees in accord with the seasons, never missing the moment of a moving line. Above, examine the patterns of the *River Chart*; below, sequence the flows of earth’s terrain. Between them, investigate the human heart, aligning and verifying the Three Powers. In motion, follow the hexagram’s nodes; at rest, rely on the *tuan*’s words. Only when Qian and Kun’s functions are enacted throughout the world can order be achieved. [One version reads: *How could one not be cautious?* This is incorrect.]\n\nThe *Wings* state: \"In the *Book of Changes*, there is the Great Ultimate, which generates the Two Modes.\" This is Confucius’ praise of the vast and empty. The virtue of Qian and Kun is the wondrous emptiness of Primordial Chaos—the era when Pangu first opened the world—this is Confucius’ investigation of antiquity. The *Guanju* concerns the proper human relations between male and female, the primacy of husband and wife in cap and marriage. Confucius, in ordering the *Book of Songs*, placed husband and wife first to rectify the Dao of yin and yang, free from deviation. In his *Wings* to the *Book of Changes*, he placed Qian and Kun first to clarify the principle that hardness and softness must be paired. Thus the *Appended Judgments* state: \"The *Book of Changes* accords with heaven and earth, and thus can encompass the Dao of heaven and earth.\" Looking up, one observes the patterns of heaven; looking down, one examines the principles of earth. Thus one knows the causes of the hidden and manifest, traces beginnings to return to endings, and thereby understands the discourse on life and death. What is meant by \"tracing beginnings\"? It is to follow the sequence of yin and yang’s Dao to generate human and thing—hence it is said: \"Cap and marriage intertwine qi.\" This is called \"knowing life.\" What is meant by \"returning to endings\"? It is to reverse the flow of the precelestial Dao, transcending the ordinary to enter sagehood—hence it is said: \"The first germ now sprouts.\" This is called \"knowing death.\"\n\nIn ancient times, Zilu asked about death. The Master said, \"Not yet understanding life, how can one understand death?\" The sage delights in inquiry and discernment, lamenting that Zilu at that moment did not further pursue the discourse on life and death to reveal the Dao of the *Book of Changes*, thereby enabling later generations to comprehend the principle of following death and reversing life, to recognize the meaning of harmonious compliance with the Dao and virtue, and to know the Way of exhausting principle and fulfilling nature to reach destiny. Thus, when the sage descends into the world, gazing up and looking down, he meticulously examines yin and yang, taking yin as the tally and yang as the mandate.\n\nWhat is meant by \"gazing up to observe the manifest tally of heaven\"? The yin qi between heaven and earth is called the \"heavenly tally\"; the yang qi between heaven and earth is called the \"heavenly mandate.\" The yin tally within the human body is called the \"fire tally\"; the yang qi within the human body is called \"nature and life.\" When yin and yang contract and extend, the tally becomes the indicator of advance and retreat. When the tally and its indicators are precise, timing is never lost. Thus, the Dao of the *Book of Changes* is governed by the \"Heavenly Heart.\"\n\nThe \"Heavenly Heart\" is the correct position of Qian. *Zi* is the gate of the Heavenly Heart where yang is born. Qian is the yang entity; the heavenly tally is pure yin. Qian yang is initially born beneath the second yin, forming *Zhen*. *Zhen* is the eldest son. *Fu* is born from *Kun*; *Fu* is one yang concealed beneath five yins. *Kun* is the mother, hence it is said: \"By relying on the mother, the foundation is established.\"\n\nThe pitch of the bell responds to the pivot of the Dipper. The *Huangzhong* pitch is in *Zi*; the movement of the Dipper’s pivot establishes *Zi*, both corresponding to the time when the first yang begins to sprout. At the third watch of the third day, the moon’s faint yang is born in the southwest; yang is born beneath the moon in the north, hence *Zhen*. Thus, *Zhen* receives *Geng* from the west; on the eighth day, *Dui* receives *Ding*. Fire yang ascends to the midpoint, level as a plumb line. On the fifteenth day, at the full moon, the moon is in the west and the sun in the east; the moon hare fully emits its light, and yang fills the hexagram, completing *Qian*. At dawn on the sixteenth day, *Xin* appears. The yin tally envelops yang, preventing its reckless flight. On the twenty-third day, the yin tally half-encases the light, which ceases below. *Kun* receives *Yi*. On the thirtieth day, the moon’s body is complete, its brightness extinguished, pure blackness facing heaven. The northeast is the region of *Gen* and the Winnowing Basket, the abode of water. *Gen* is the path of the demon; within the human body, *Gui* fills the meridians, depleting its qi. When the tally is exhausted and *Gui* is spent, one yang revives. Thus, *Ren* and *Gui* are paired with *Jia* and *Yi*. Like *Qian* beginning with *Fu*, the numbers seven, eight, nine, and six end at twenty, completing *Kun*. True tally returns to concealment.\n\nThis reveals that the eight trigrams—*Qian* and *Kan*—reside in the north; *Gen* and *Zhen* return to the east; *Li* faces south; *Kun* and *Dui* return to the west. They interweave and array the luminaries, shifting and moving without losing the center. The center is the Heavenly Heart, the Supreme Ultimate, the primordial essence—subtle and invisible. Heaven generates the sage, who infers, measures, and verifies, using tally as evidence. Observing the images of the sun and moon, he models their forms. Like the celestial observer who erects a gnomon to use its shadow as a standard, he discerns the seasons, determines auspiciousness and inauspiciousness. At the issuance of a single decree, he must comply with the seasons. By examining the movement of lines, he knows when yang is born. Gazing up, he scrutinizes the *River Chart* to clarify the Qian image and the intersection of yin and yang. Looking down, he sequences the earth’s forms to detail the Kun body and the wondrous transformations of metal and water. Inwardly, he examines the human heart, issuing decrees in accord with the seasons, moving in accordance with the hexagrams’ nodes. *Fu* follows *Zhen* from the prior stillness; the *Tuan* commentary states: \"Great indeed is the primal power of Qian! All things owe their beginning to it. It permeates heaven.\" Clouds move, rain falls, and the myriad things flow into form. Embracing profundity, vastness, softness, and compliance, it is beneficial and steadfast. Having observed the patterns of heaven and sequenced the forms of earth, and with the human heart rectified, the gates of Qian and Kun enact the Dao of yin and yang, enabling heaven, earth, and the myriad things to attain the governance of natural order.\n\nThis chapter cites the sage’s ancient investigations and celestial observations as metaphors, illustrating the union of sun and moon, the functions of Qian and Kun, enabling the world to distinguish yin and yang, recognize advance and retreat, understand creation, model forms, respond to tally and rhythm, and carefully regulate movement and stillness. Thus, the heaven and earth within this single body are governed. It contains no discourse on drawing forth or adding to the dragon and tiger within the crucible.\n\n**Chapter Five: The Sovereign Governing the Polity**\n\nThe first step in governing the polity is to renew the old and reform the obsolete, to bind and secure the subtle and hidden, to unfold and disseminate the precious essentials. The handle of the Dipper commands transformation; the net of lines and images moves within. Auspiciousness and inauspiciousness arise externally. The five planets interweave, aligning or diverging in response to the seasons. The four and seven stars, discordant and perverse, separate and scatter. Prostrating and rising, *Wenchang* governs and records. The censors and assistants, the hundred officials and their bureaus, each oversee their respective domains. The sun harmonizes the five phases; the moon receives the six pitches. The five and six make thirty degrees; when the degrees are complete, they begin anew. Tracing beginnings and grasping endings, the threads of survival and extinction are held. If the sovereign is arrogant, dissolute, and overbearing, violating the Dao; if the minister is crafty and sycophantic, acting contrary to the proper path; if the Dipper’s handle waxes and wanes, deviating from the norm—calamity and misfortune arise. Those who enforce the law admonish and reprove, interrogating transgressions to admonish the ruler. The Pole Star receives rectitude, at ease in its position, entrusting matters to subordinates. The Bright Hall disseminates governance; the state suffers no harm to the Dao.\n\nThe Immortal Elder uses the difficulty of refining the elixir as an analogy for governing the polity, thereby revealing the difficulty of governing a disordered populace. In cultivating the elixir, one knows the difficulty of restraining the mind-horse. The old stains and vulgar impurities must all be renewed—this is the first step in governing the polity, called \"renewing the old.\" To curb anger and restrain desire, to see goodness and emulate it—this is the foundation of cultivating the self, hence \"reforming the obsolete.\"\n\nWhether governing the polity or cultivating the self, one must first begin with the most subtle and hidden aspects of oneself, binding and investigating them to achieve governance. Thus, governance is accomplished, and the self is cultivated. Confucius said, \"Governing with virtue is like the North Star: it remains in its place while the other stars pay homage.\" Virtue is not merely for governance; it is the origin of all conduct. Can the cultivator of the elixir be without virtue?\n\nWhat is virtue? Benevolence, compassion, love, clarity, and sincerity—these are the qualities of one of supreme virtue. Reverence, magnanimity, trustworthiness, diligence, and kindness—these are the gates of the human Dao.\n\nTo cultivate the elixir, one must first prioritize kindness and diligence. Kindness suffices to employ others, and the immortal elders say: \"To unfold and bestow treasures is to externally win the people’s joy and internally preserve one’s true qi.\" This is the foremost handle of the essential Dao. If treasures are repeatedly bestowed, one can then unify and transform the guiding principles. The guiding principles are the masters of enforcing the law; when skillfully unified and transformed, those who enforce the law will not find it burdensome.\n\nWhen the inner lines of the hexagram move, fortune and misfortune externally respond—just as the five planets, in their erratic or orderly courses, correspond to fortune and misfortune in due time. The stirring and parting, the joining and shifting, share this same meaning: *chi* (誃) means to change, and *li* (離) means to move or shift.\n\nSpeaking of the twenty-eight lunar mansions in discord: when *chi* and *li* occur, all bow and rise in deference. The Literary Star governs the Supreme Subtlety as its principal star, and the *Kui* constellation, bearing its basket of six stars, is called the Southern Pole, the guiding star of the human body. It is the spirit of the Vermilion Bird, recording names in the register of longevity. The star of empty essence is the guiding discipline of the Three Terraces, and the recording star is the leader of the Three Terraces. In the human body, it governs the Hall of Light, unfolding the virtue that enlightens the world. The radiant star of the Cavernous Subtlety is the Purple Tenuity’s assistant and minister—namely, the two stars revering the Emperor. In the human body, they are the spirit of the Dark Warrior. If one beholds them, one’s lifespan may reach a thousand years. The remaining hundreds of joints and myriad spirits each oversee their respective domains.\n\nThe cultivation of the elixir, a matter intimately tied to the workings of creation, is thus more difficult than governing the polity. Hence, the stars are used to illustrate the body: the days and months harmonize with the Five Phases. At *zi*, *chou*, and *yin*, the sun and moon align with the Five Stars in the north; at *mao*, *chen*, and *si*, they align in the west; at *wu*, *wei*, and *shen*, they align in the south; at *you*, *xu*, and *hai*, they align in the east.\n\nIn the time of Yao, the celestial heart was established at *zi* on the *jiachen* day, when the winter solstice occurred in the Void Mansion of the Rat. In the Han *Taichu* era, the winter solstice occurred in the Oxherd Mansion. In the Tang *Taiyan* era, it occurred in the Eastern Dipper. From the Song dynasty to the present, it has occurred in the Southern Winnowing Basket. This is called the precession of the equinoxes. Thus, when the Great Yang obtains Fire and Earth, its essence and radiance increase; when it obtains Metal and Water, its brilliance grows ever more dazzling.\n\nThe moon is governed by the six pitch-pipes: the *lü* are yang, and the *lü* are yin. One and five, one and six, combine to form three and thirty degrees, completing the cycle of the sun and moon. Hence, it is said: when the degrees are exhausted, they begin anew. The sun and moon circulate in endless return, giving rise to fullness, waning, darkness, and conjunction. The world, following the fullness, waning, darkness, and conjunction, experiences the alternation of cold and heat. People, following the alternation of cold and heat, undergo birth, aging, illness, and death. Tracing to its origin, one may attain enduring existence; grasping its end, one may avoid perishing.\n\nThe ruler is the heart; the minister is the body. The heart is the self.\n\nThe body is but a thing. If my heart grows arrogant and overbearing, or if I become self-satisfied and overflowing, or if the body and things contend against one another, failing to follow the proper laws, then the fullness and waning of the moon will fall into disorder, its waxing and waning will bring misfortune, and those who uphold the law will reproach and interrogate their ruler.\n\nThe Celestial Pole is the Wenchang star mentioned earlier, also called the Southern Pole. The Celestial Pole moves with rectitude and vigilance, cautiously entrusting matters to those below. The Hall of Light is the platform of the ministers, who diligently enact good governance so that the state knows no discord. The state, too, is a body. When the body is at peace and its qi harmonious, the Dao is unharmed.\n\nThis chapter draws an analogy: cultivating the body and refining the elixir is like a ruler governing the state. If the state obtains the right people and enacts proper governance, the world will be at peace. If one cultivates the body, exhausts the heart, and establishes destiny, the elixir path will be accomplished. In other versions, the phrase \"the beginning of governing\" lacks the line about \"renewing the cauldron,\" and this text has long circulated in fragmented form. Later generations, unable to fathom its profound words, introduced many errors in various editions. Zhu Xi of the Huian school corrected hundreds of characters but could not perfect it entirely—without encountering a sagely teacher, it is difficult to distinguish stone from jade.\n\n**Chapter Six: Refining the Self and Establishing the Foundation**\n\nInwardly, nurture the self with tranquility and emptiness. The original text states: \"Illumine within, reflect upon the body, close its openings, and fortify the spirit-root.\" The Three Lights sink into obscurity; nurture the inner pearl. Though unseen when gazed upon, it is near and easily sought. The Yellow Center gradually opens, its principle moistening and permeating the flesh. If the beginning is correct, the end will be cultivated. The foundation is established, yet one must not cling to the One to obscure the world—none will know of it.\n\nTo nurture the self is to refine it throughout one’s life. Confucius said: \"The noble person first stabilizes the self before acting, steadies the heart before speaking, and secures relationships before making requests. The noble person cultivates these three, and thus remains whole.\" The sage’s concerns run deep, preparing for the true nature of people. Every action, word, and request—these three are the ultimate principles for entering sageliness, the essential words for nurturing the self. Treasure essence, accumulate qi, and nurture the self. Forget the heart before the mirror—this is refining the self. Constant stillness, constant responsiveness—this is refining the self. Accumulating virtue, accomplishing merit—this is refining the self. Enduring hardship in practice is called \"refining\"; mastering the practice is called \"cultivation.\" Those who refine the elixir must first refine the self, enduring hardship and forbearance to enter the chamber at the proper time. Only when the six roots are profoundly settled and the practice becomes thoroughly familiar, forgetting even what can be forgotten, can one proceed with the work.\n\nThus, the *Great Learning* states: \"The Way of great learning lies in illuminating the luminous virtue, in renewing the people, and in resting in the highest good.\" Illuminating virtue, knowing people, and resting in the highest good—this aligns precisely with refining the self. Moreover, \"Only after knowing where to rest can one be settled; only after being settled can one be tranquil; only after being tranquil can one be at peace; only after being at peace can one deliberate; only after deliberating can one attain.\" This corresponds exactly to the essentials of tranquility and emptiness. Emptiness does not mean utter voidness; the immortal master said: \"The primordial One qi emerges from emptiness.\" This is the ultimate in tranquility and emptiness.\n\nThe \"original text\" refers to seeking from the source of one’s own birth, thereby knowing that true essence and true qi are the illumination within the body. Most people are enslaved by cleverness and intelligence, depleting their spirit and qi. The great cultivator dismisses cleverness, sets aside wisdom, reflects inwardly, forgets the self externally, seals the senses to fortify the spirit-root, and nurtures the inner pearl with focused vision. Only thus can the Yellow Center open its principle, moistening the flesh. The beginning is correct—this is the work of refining the self; the end is cultivated—this is the work of approaching the furnace. The foundation is established—this exhausts the Dao of refining the self; the final step is the work of entering the chamber. The One is the self, the *wu* (戊), and the *fang* (防). This character *fang* penetrates to the heart-ground of [Laozi’s] \"Master Yang.\"\n\nConfucius said: \"My Dao is threaded through with One.\" Laozi said: \"Attaining the One, all things are complete.\" The Buddha said: \"All dharmas return to the One.\" Thus, \"Heaven engenders water through the One\"—one must know that this water is born from within the One. The One is the central line of *kan* (坎). If the One is obscured, essence gathers and spirit guards; if the One is concealed, the numinous disperses and qi scatters. If one knows the One, the cosmos lies in the palm of the hand. If one attains the One, the myriad transformations arise within the body.\n\nThe marvel of the One cannot be understood without a master—thus it is said: \"The One is that which, when concealed, remains unknown to the world.\" It is also called \"that which none know.\" The essential method of the Immortal Elder’s elixir begins with fortifying the numinous root: refining the self to congeal spirit. \"Nurturing the child-pearl\" means accumulating essence to amass qi. Only when the work of refining the self is pure may one proceed to refine the returning elixir. Yet世人, unaware of the greatness of refining the self, rashly pursue the half-hour’s work of obtaining the medicine, hoping for success—how foolish indeed!\n\nThus the *Scripture of Purity* states: \"Inwardly observe the heart, outwardly observe the form, and from afar observe things—one sees only emptiness, nothing that is empty, nothing that empties. Emptiness being void, even the void is void; the void of void being void, there is only profound stillness, constant quiescence, quiescence without anything to be quiescent.\" To the ordinary person, this would seem the moment of great rest, of ultimate liberation. Yet why does the text proceed to speak of desire? If desire cannot arise, this is true stillness; only true stillness can respond to things. Look closely: when one has reached the point of true stillness in responding to things, one has just begun the work of *fang*. As for the art of elixir-refining, the ordinary person has not even dreamed of it.\n\nSome offer a single meal or build a single pagoda; others practice the \"Three Peaks\" arts of battle, or sit in dry meditation reciting scriptures, or engage in \"non-action,\" or make prayers and sacrifices. These may be acts of goodness, but if one calls them the practice of the Dao, one has not yet entered its gate. If the work of nurturing the self is lacking even slightly, then—as Lü Dongbin said—\"The sevenfold returning elixir lies in man, but first one must refine the self and await the time.\" The Mud-Pill Palace states: \"Without kinship in speech, the work will not be round.\" Master Ziyang said: \"If you wish to refine the ninefold cycle, first refine the self and hold the heart—only then will the sages appear in succession.\" How could one not heed this?\n\nThe Perfected of Great Emptiness, having received the instructions of Master Huangfang, followed them to Mount Wuyi and began the work. At first, in refining the self, every obstacle summoned a hundred demons. The Perfected, standing firm, declared: \"I bind and send off the demonic essences, severing the heads of the six thieves!\" Then, settling into stillness, he sat. This thought not arising, the root of craving was cut. Only afterward did he learn contemplation. This matter of refining the self demands even greater reflection.\n\nThis chapter speaks only of nurturing the self; it contains no mention of the Golden Tiger, the crucible, or the chamber. To take the Three Lights as the Yang Fire and Yin Talisman, or the Golden Embryo, is entirely mistaken.\n\n**Chapter Seven: Illuminating the Two Apertures**\n\nThe man of superior virtue acts without contrivance, not seeking through scrutiny; the man of lesser virtue acts, and his function does not cease. When the upper is closed, it is called \"being\"; when the lower is closed, it is called \"non-being.\" Non-being serves the upper; above, the numinous virtue resides within these two apertures. The method of metal and qi also depends on mutual awareness. Guard the white to preserve the black; the numinous will come of itself. The white is the essence of metal; the black is the foundation of water. Water is the pivot of the Dao; its number is named the One, the beginning of yin and yang. It contains the Yellow Sprout, the master of the Five Metals. The Northern River Chariot—thus lead is black without but holds golden radiance within. \"Clad in coarse cloth, yet bearing jade within\": outwardly a madman, metal is the mother of water, the mother nurturing the child’s embryo; water is the child of metal, the child concealed within the mother’s womb. The Perfected’s subtlety is as if present, as if absent, like the vast abyss now sinking, now rising. Retreating, they distribute and guard their respective domains. Gather the white; refine it until it becomes vermilion. The outer guards, the inner is true. Residing in a square inch, mixed yet mutually constrained, it is born before Heaven and Earth, majestic and lofty. Surrounding it are walls and gates, resembling Penglai Island, encircling and enclosing, with four passages sealed. Hesitating, one guards and defends, tightly securing to block all treachery. Curved yet interconnected, it wards against the unforeseen. One may be free from anxious thought, from wearying the spirit and qi. The chamber is full, yet nothing can remain. Those who guard it prosper; those who lose it perish. In movement and stillness, rest and activity, it is ever with man.\n\nThe man of superior virtue is one whose embodiment is complete, a scholar of \"nothing not done.\"\n\nWhen a man reaches the age of sixteen, his true essence is complete and desire arises to discharge it. The man of complete virtue can preserve and cherish it, remaining perfectly undisturbed. If he then encounters an enlightened teacher who imparts the Dao of wuwei cultivation to nurture his longevity, he becomes a scholar of \"nothing not done,\" a man of complete virtue. This is the transformation of the sage through wuwei, the accomplishment of the great man in achieving wuwei.\n\nThe man of lesser virtue is one who seizes the workings of creation, a scholar who plunders the myriad things. For all men, when they first reach sixteen, their true essence remains undischarged, called \"pure Qian.\" Yet once desire stirs, the middle line of Qian departs and enters the Kun palace, and Qian can no longer remain pure. The heart becomes empty, forming Li. Thereafter, day and night, leakage occurs—how much remains if one merely preserves it? Only the perfected man, without waiting for exhaustion, practices the sage’s way of restoring wholeness to attain immortality. This is the scholar of lesser virtue, one who seizes the workings of creation, the sage’s path of following one’s nature, the achievement of the divine man through wei.\n\nThe man of superior virtue practices wuwei yet accomplishes all things, attaining the complete body of the Great Ultimate and achieving the work of the posterior heaven. This is called \"not seeking through scrutiny.\" The man of lesser virtue practices wei and acts with purpose, seizing the function of creation to accomplish the work of the prior heaven. This is called \"its function never ceasing.\" As the immortal master said: \"It begins with action, unseen by others; only when it reaches wuwei do people recognize it. They see wuwei as essential and subtle, yet who knows that action is the foundation?\" These words exhaust the matter of the Golden Elixir—it is not easy. The perfected man acts only when compelled, as Laozi said: \"Fine weapons are inauspicious tools, used only when there is no alternative.\" This refers precisely to such a case.\n\nClosing above is called \"having\"; closing above pertains to Kun. The virtue of Kun lies in its stillness, which contracts and holds the Wu earth within Kan. Within it resides the prior-heaven true unity of qi. Closing below is called \"not having\"; closing below pertains to Qian. The virtue of Qian lies in its stillness, which concentrates emptiness and holds the Ji earth within Li. Within it is contained the posterior-heaven natural water. The two apertures are used as the Classic says: \"Constantly without desire, observe its wonders; constantly without desire, observe its apertures.\" These two emerge from the same source yet have different names; together they are called \"the mysterious, the mystery within mystery, the gate of all wonders.\" The sage has no dual mind; his mysterious words and subtle speech are never lofty or distant, yet for ten thousand generations, none can fathom their beginnings. One must receive transmission from a teacher. Even the Yellow Emperor, that supreme sage, if he had not studied under Guangchengzi, how could he have illuminated this Dao? Only thus are the apertures described. The sage can do no more to depict them. At the ultimate point, Fuxi drew the trigrams, beginning with Qian and Kun to define these apertures. King Wen later clarified them by doubling the lines, and Confucius expounded the meaning of Qian’s straightness and Kun’s openness. Laozi said: \"The gate of the mysterious female is called the root of heaven and earth.\" Śākyamuni spoke of the \"treasury of the true Dharma eye, the wondrous mind of nirvana.\" All these are direct pointers, visible to the eye.\n\nA superior scholar may be able to comprehend these apertures on his own, but their functions and workings cannot be understood without a teacher. \"Not having\" is to serve the above; \"not speaking\" is the nature of Ji. \"Having\" is the Wu earth; emotion is like the nature of Ji. If one can serve the emotion of Wu, then emotion will surely cherish the benevolence of nature.\n\nAbove resides the spiritual virtue, the prior-heaven unity of qi that comes from emptiness—this is the virtue of spirit. The immortal elder repeatedly pointed to these two apertures, saying: \"These two cavities, their methods and qi, mutually depend on each other.\" These two lines are the key to the *Cantong Qi*. Even ten thousand generations later, those of keen intelligence at the Yanmen gate could not comprehend them on their own. Fangweng said: \"The gate that gives me life, the door that brings my death—how many are awake? How many are enlightened? Last night, the iron man pondered deeply: long life and immortality are made by man. Are not the gate that gives me life and the door that brings my death these two cavities?\"\n\nAs previously explained, the principles of Qian and Kun, the sun and moon, and the workings of creation—once the mysterious barrier is firmly established, the text proceeds to discuss the two substances, metal and water, in order. It is not vague. The cultivator of the Elixir, having understood these apertures, must further discern what the metal qi is, what mutual dependence entails, and what its uses are. Only with deep and thorough comprehension can one refine the Elixir.\n\nTo \"know the white\" is to recognize the purity of its essence—pure white and unstained, this is knowing the white. To \"guard the black\" is to preserve the foundation of the black, awaiting the time when water is generated—this is guarding the black. The initial arising of water is called \"prior-heaven,\" for its utmost truth is called \"spiritual clarity.\" When white and black correspond, metal and water flourish abundantly. Once Ji earth restrains the water, the gold is refined, and metal and water fill the crucible. Thus it is said: \"Spiritual clarity comes of itself.\" What is called water? The pivot of the Dao, its number is one, for water is born from the Heavenly One and is the beginning of yin and yang. It contains the yellow sprout, as the *Yi* says: \"Though yin has beauty, it contains it to serve the king’s affairs.\" Thus, the Great Mystery becomes water, and the yellow sprout becomes the Elixir. Within water lies the Elixir, hence the metaphor: \"the mystery contains the yellow sprout.\" Within black lead lies white metal; within the river chariot lies the yellow sprout—just as a scholar may conceal jade, and if clad in coarse cloth, harm will not befall him.\n\nMetal is the mother of water, for Dui metal generates Kan water, and the middle line of Kan belongs to metal. Thus it is said: \"The mother’s womb holds the child; the fetal water is metal.\" The child is the Ren and Gui waters, born from the west. The middle line of Dui belongs to Kan, hence it is said: \"The child is concealed within the mother’s womb.\" The \"perfected man of utmost subtlety\" is the body of Qian. Qian is the most spiritual and wondrous of things; its form is sometimes present, sometimes absent. The \"great abyss\" is the image of Kun. Kun can sink or float; its form is neither seen nor heard. Thus, Qian can transform, and Kun’s virtue is to give birth. Once transformation and birth occur, Qian and Kun are distributed, each guarding its domain.\n\nTo \"gather the white\" is to extract silver from lead, which is white. Refining it produces the national Elixir, which is vermilion; refining it alone yields lead powder. This is akin to gathering and refining external cinnabar. Thus, the external Elixir must have an outer guard, appearing as vermilion’s radiance, while internally preserving its true whiteness. \"Residing in a square inch, mixed yet mutually constrained\"—within the obscure barrier lies a thing, the time before the Great Ultimate divided, which is prior-heaven. Within it resides the prior-heaven true unity of qi, dwelling before the Great Ultimate, before the image of the Lord. Thus it is said: \"majestic and lofty.\" \"Surrounding it are walls and gates, resembling Penglai Island\"—Qian’s image is also like walls and gates, like Penglai. The imagery describes the body, and the Yi hour is like the above, all referring to the crucible. \"Encircling and enclosing\" is the outer guard; \"four passages sealed\" is the tight external defense.\n\nGuard and defense must be tightly sealed, never to be parted from for even a moment—what can be parted from is not the Dao. Blocking and cutting off wickedness requires regulating entry and exit with methodical restraint, keeping internal and external in check so that fear is instilled and the true white within may reside undisturbed. Where curves meet and connect, one must establish a sacred precinct, strictly guarded to prevent unforeseen calamity. The Immortal Elder, in his compassion, from \"encircling and enclosing\" onward, has given explicit instruction, fearing harm from the unforeseen. One must remain free from thought and worry, never allowing sorrow or toil to intrude. Thus it is said: one may be without thought, but not with sorrow or labor, lest the spirit and qi fill the chamber only to suffer depletion. Hence, \"those who guard it prosper; those who lose it perish.\" Even the slightest lapse in vigilance may lead to ruin. Therefore, in movement and stillness, rest and activity, not a moment may be spent in carelessness or neglect. Then the qi of the golden crucible will be firm for both self and other, mutually harmonizing and subduing. Thus it is said: \"it is ever with man.\"\n\nThis chapter directly points to the essence of the two apertures, elucidating the function of metal and water. For the practitioner of cultivation, reading and reciting the *Cantong Qi* to this point, one realizes that the very first step is a matter of great difficulty. Those of lesser virtue who practice the Dao of deliberate action rely entirely on refining the self. If self-refinement is even slightly lacking, the numinous will not come.\n\n**Chapter Eight: Discerning the Upright and the Deviant**\n\nThose who engage in internal visualization of the five viscera, contemplative breathing, external pacing of the Dipper and constellations, or stepping the celestial stems and branches; those who practice the Yin Dao to suppress the Nine Ones, disturb the primordial womb, consume qi, or cause the intestines to rumble; those who expel the upright and inhale external evil, remaining sleepless day and night, never resting through dark and new moon—such practitioners exhaust the body daily, growing weary and disoriented, appearing as if deranged, their hundred vessels seething like a boiling cauldron, unable to attain clarity. Dwelling in earthen huts, erecting altars, offering morning and evening sacrifices, invoking spirits to manifest forms, dreaming of encounters and stirring emotions, they rejoice and delight, believing their lives will surely be prolonged. Yet suddenly, their allotted span ends, their bodies decay and rot, their forms exposed. Every action they take is contrary and rebellious, losing the pivotal mechanism. Such arts are myriad, numbering in the thousands, even tens of thousands. Yet they all deviate from the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, twisting and turning to incur the wrath of the Nine Capitals.\n\nThe wise, perceiving these pitfalls, understand the cause and practice diligently, never resting day or night. After three years of ingesting the elixir, they may wander far, walking through fire unscathed, entering water unsoaked, able to preserve or abandon life at will, ever joyful and free from care. Having attained the Dao and perfected virtue, they conceal themselves to await the time when the Great One summons them, relocating to the Central Continent. Once their merit is complete, they ascend, receiving registers and charts.\n\nThe practitioner of cultivation must comprehend the true great Dao. Without the union of yin and yang, the transformation of Kan and Li, all else is but peripheral and left-handed paths. Practices such as internal visualization of the five viscera, contemplative breathing, external pacing of the Dipper, stepping the celestial stems, or manipulating mudras; those who engage in chamber arts, controlling the Three Peaks through sexual rites, or practice the Nine Ones, sword techniques, or the Five Affairs, disturbing the primordial womb by interfacing with external qi—these are all perverse practices, the lowest of the peripheral paths. Others expel the upright and inhale the deviant, endure hunger to consume qi, or discuss longevity through seated meditation, remaining awake day and night; or erect altars to sacrifice to spirits, seeing apparitions and forms. These are the chaotic paths of the peripheral ways, scattering the spirit and causing the hundred vessels to seethe, the mind to rejoice daily, and dreams to stir nightly. Though they traverse a thousand paths and a hundred routes, all is without merit. Having deviated from the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, their words do not align with true masters, nor do they harmonize with the union of yin and yang. Twisting and turning, they incur the wrath of the Nine Capitals—how then can they coalesce the pearl of a single grain of millet? Hoping to prolong life, they instead shorten it.\n\nYet if there are those of discernment who encounter the words of a true master, they will practice with unwavering diligence, never resting day or night, seeking the medicine with single-minded devotion. After three years of secretive ingestion and practice, they may wander freely, and in nine years, their bodies will become light. After twelve years of accumulation, neither water nor fire can harm them. Dwelling in grotto-heavens, they live without care, feasting in the Jasper Pool with eternal joy. Having attained the Dao, they conceal themselves further, accumulating virtue to await the time when the Three Heavens record their name, and the Great One summons them to assume a position as an immortal, relocating to the Central Continent. If their merit is great, they may ascend through the Three Realms, receiving promotions and seals, accepting registers and charts—like Zhang, Ge, Jingyang, Fuqiu, Zhong, and Lü, the ranks of the perfected. Such is the path the sage should follow.\n\nIn this chapter, the Immortal Elder forcefully distinguishes between delusion and clarity, deviance and uprightness. Deviance incurs the punishment of the Nine Capitals; uprightness leads to merit fulfilled and ascension—this is the inevitable principle, leaving no room for doubt. As for the sequence of practice and the steps to be taken, they follow below.\n\n**Chapter Nine: The Two Caverns of Dragon and Tiger**\n\nThe fire calculations are not empty; they are expounded through the *Yi* to clarify them. The crescent moon method applies to the crucible: the White Tiger serves as the pivot for refinement, mercury as the flowing pearl. The Green Dragon rises with it, the East uniting with the West. The hun and po naturally constrain each other. The upper cavern corresponds to the number eight of Dui; the lower cavern to the number eight of Gen. The two eights unite their essence, and the body of Qian and Kun is thus formed. Two eights make one jin—this is the true, unerring Dao of the *Yi*.\n\nOnly now does the Immortal Elder lay out the crucible and furnace, the Dragon and Tiger, and the qi of the caverns. The crescent moon crucible, the White Tiger, the upper cavern, Dui, and the po all pertain to the West—*that* is the Jade Pool.\n\nThe terms \"everlasting sun,\" \"flowing pearl,\" \"Green Dragon,\" \"lower cavern,\" *Gen*, and *hun* pertain to the East—*this* is the self, the Golden Crucible. The crescent moon crucible is called the Great Unity Divine Crucible, known as the Yin Crucible. Its inverted and upright form resembles the moon at its first crescent. The White Tiger is a being of the Western *Dui* Palace. When heaven and earth first divided, it originally belonged to *that* realm. The tiger’s majesty responds when summoned; its radiant essence nurtures the growth of all things. Though it may harm or kill, it harbors the vast qi of the Great Vehicle. King Wen, in his reworking of the *Yi*, said: *\"Treading on the tiger’s tail, it does not bite—auspicious.\"* And again: *\"Treading the level Way, the secluded one holds to virtue—auspicious.\"* Confucius said: *\"Joy responds to Qian.\"* And again: *\"To tread in purity and go forth alone—this is my wish.\"* Those who cultivate the elixir must first fear this tiger and subdue it. Once subdued, it may serve as the pivot for refinement without biting.\n\n*Li* is the sun, the everlasting sun, within which lies cinnabar, called the flowing pearl. The Green Dragon is a being of the Eastern *Zhen* Palace. Once the kalpa is firmly established, it originally belongs to *this* realm. The dragon’s power is transformative; it responds and communicates, moving with clouds and rain, shaping all things. In *Qian*’s nine-two: *\"The dragon appears in the field—auspicious to see the great person.\"* The Master said: *\"The dragon’s virtue is upright and centered.\"* Yet people, failing to grasp the dragon’s life-generating power, are often harmed by it. If one awakens to it, respects it, and regulates and subdues it, one may then harness and employ it. Raising the East to unite with the West is the harmonious union of ritual and propriety.\n\n*Dui* and *Gen* each bear the number eight, flowing from *wu* to *ji*. *Hun* and *po* naturally constrain each other; metal and wood do not stand apart. The two caverns unite their essence, and the body of *Qian* and *Kun* is formed. That the Dao of the *Yi* does not falter is because the two eights balance to form one *jin*. One *jin* denotes the number of completion, for numbers accumulate from small to great: ten grains make a pellet, one pellet like a millet seed, one millet seed slightly more than a *daogui*. Sixty-four millet seeds make one *gui*; ten millet seeds make a *lei*; ten *lei* make a *zhu*; two *zhu* and four *lei* make a *qian*; ten *qian* make a *liang*; eight *zhu* make a *dian*. The *Shuowen* says six *zhu* make a *zi*; the *Jian Yun* says eight *liang* make a *zi*—both are incorrect. Three *zi* make a *liang*, which is twenty-four *zhu*. Sixteen *liang* make one *jin*; one *jin* has three hundred eighty-four *zhu*; one *jin* and four *liang* make a *lüe*.\n\nThe ancients divided the *zhu* to correspond to the numbers of the hexagrams and lines.\n\n**Chapter Ten: Metal Returns to Its Nature**\nWhen metal enters the fierce fire, its color does not fade; its radiance remains. Since the opening of heaven and earth, the sun and moon have never dimmed, nor has metal lost its weight. The sun and moon retain their forms as usual. Metal is fundamentally born from the moon. At the new moon, the sun receives its tally; at the dark moon, they embrace and conceal their outlines, sinking into the cavernous void. Metal regains its original nature, its majesty and radiance, and the crucible glows.\n\nThe Immortal Elder does not speak idly. Only now does he point to the function of metal, for without metal’s power, the elixir cannot be formed. Thus it is called the Golden Elixir—not the gold or jade of the world, nor that extracted from earth and stone, but the marvel of heaven and earth’s alchemy, the inversion of the Five Phases, produced from the great transformative cavern of *Qian* and *Kun*. *This* is the true metal.\n\nToday’s blind masters, when speaking of the Golden Elixir, grow flustered, not knowing what it is. They prattle of cultivation yet have never heard the name of the Golden Elixir, nor do they fathom the words of the *Cantong Qi*. They deceive the world, unaware that the Immortal Elder has clearly pointed to this metal’s divine transformations. Some fools, upon seeing this text, fail to examine the true body and function of yin-yang metal and instead guess it refers to smelting and furnace fires. How pitiful! How deluded! If no hint were given to the world, in ten thousand generations this text would grow ever more lofty and distant. People, unable to glimpse its shores, would abandon it entirely—how then could they seek the path of cultivation?\n\nThose of superior roots and keen faculties must know: this metal existed before the primordial chaos, before the Great Ultimate divided. It originally belonged to *Qian*, hence it is called *Qian*-metal. When the great kalpa is about to turn, those who repay the virtue of chaos arrive. At this moment, *Qian* first unites with *Kun*. This metal stumbles and gallops, rushing into the *Kun* Palace—it is called *Kun*-within-metal. *Kun*’s three lines are originally hollow, called *Kun*-earth. When this metal fills its center, it forms the *Kan* trigram. *Kan*’s proper position is in the north, the land of *Gui* water. Thus *Kan* is water, with metal concealed within—hence it is called water-within-metal. This water-within-metal is the treasure of the prior heaven, yet it cannot long remain in the posterior *Kan*. It transforms into *Dui*. *Dui* may leap from the northern *Kan*’s door, residing to the right in the western sky’s *You* direction. There, this metal grows day and night. *You*’s proper position belongs to *Dui*, so this metal governs the elixir’s path within *Dui*—hence it is called *Dui*-metal.\n\nThose who refine the elixir must seek the subtle and trace the hidden, investigate beginnings and ends, study things to gain knowledge, explore their sources and streams, and examine their roots and sprouts. If one refines the Golden Elixir, one must seek this metal. To seek this metal, one does not seek in *Qian*, nor in *Kun*, nor in *Kan*, but solely in *Dui*. *Dui* is the same vessel as *Kun*-moon. As the saying goes: *\"The same vessel is easy to work; different vessels are hard to craft.\"* *Dui*’s marvel is that it acts in *Kun*’s stead. Thus, in refining the Golden Elixir, apart from this *Dui*-metal, all other paths are side doors that cannot lead to the Dao. The Yellow Emperor, Laozi, and the ancient sages and immortals all used this metal to complete the Dao.\n\nKing Wen, in reworking *Xun*’s nine-five, said: *\"Three days before *geng*, three days after *geng*.\"* Confucius, in his commentary on *Yi*, said: *\"Wing follows *Dui*; the yielding complies with the firm.\"* The noble one, in issuing commands and acting, follows *geng*—for *geng* is metal. The scripture says: *\"Three days, and the moon emerges at *geng*.\"* Moreover, Śākyamuni relied on this metal to attain Buddhahood, hence he is called the Golden Immortal. This *Dui*-within-metal is born of the same body as the celestial Great Yin, shining simultaneously with it. The moon in the sky is called the Great Yin. Because this *Dui*-metal shares its function, it is also called the Lesser Yin, or yin-within-metal. The celestial Great Yin receives the radiance of the Great Yang to complete the seasons. The Lesser Yin of *Dui* continues the transformation of the great thousand worlds, giving birth to beings and things.\n\nThe Immortal Elder, having penetrated the wisdom of former sages, knew the root of this metal, traced its marvelous transformations, and revealed its divine changes. As for worldly metal, though it may endure as long as heaven and earth, entering fire only refines its color, and prolonged refining does not diminish its weight—how much more so this *Dui*-metal, born from the great transformative crucible of *Qian* and *Kun*!\n\nThe moon’s light waxes and wanes, and the *Dui*-metal flows and turns—thus it is said that its form remains constant. At the new moon, sun and moon unite as jade discs; the moon receives the sun’s tally and manifests the light of the first yang at the *gengshen* position—this is the celestial Great Yin. Correspondingly, this *Dui*-metal, in accord with the moon’s new phase, also generates the first yang’s cinnabar at the primal chaos position on the third day—this is the worldly Lesser Yin. Hence it is said that metal is born from the moon. At the new moon, the sun confers its tally—how then does metal return to its mother? The trigram of metal is *Dui*; the mother of *Dui* is *Kun*. *Dui* cannot long retain its metal; the metal, too, acts in accordance with the seasons. The wing of *Kun* is called \"containing pattern, steadfast in season\"—it acts in due time.\n\nThe sage’s mind is wondrous in this: once the metal is activated, *Dui* returns to its mother and enfolds itself in *Kun*, just as the moon at its darkest is wholly enveloped by the sun. Why is this? On the last day of the lunar month, the moon’s entire body is concealed, its vast expanse covered by the sun. On the first, second, and third days, it moves through its degrees, and its radiance is again emitted. Likewise, when metal returns to its mother, the metal’s true essence sinks and merges with the profound void, becoming the world’s utility. From one comes two, from two comes three; when the kalpic cycle turns again, the metal will be reborn. If this metal is reborn, it must restore its original nature. Why? Nature is the function of *Qian*; *Qian* is uprightness. Entrusting metal to *Kun*, *Kun* to *Kan*, *Kan* to *Dui*—the *Dui*-metal unfolds its essence and restores its original nature, thereby returning this metal to the palace of *Qian*. The metal crucible of *Qian* regains its seed, and through refinement, the golden elixir is formed. Thus, this elixir is called the \"golden liquid returning elixir,\" and the crucible is named the \"majestic radiance golden crucible.\" It is said that the \"majestic radiance crucible\" is so named because of the blazing, flourishing fire—this golden elixir, as recorded in the alchemical texts, is revered and feared by the sun, moon, stars, celestial dragons, true lords, and divine spirits of creation, all of whom gather to protect it.\n\n**Chapter Eleven: The Full Merit of the Two Earths**\n\nThe numbers of *zi* and *wu* unite; the three *wu* and *ji* are called the five threes. Once harmonized, the eight stones form the proper framework. Breathing nurtures and embraces; awaiting the union of husband and wife, yellow earth is the father of metal, the flowing pearl the child of water. Water regards earth as its dam; earth subdues water to prevent overflow. The Vermilion Bird is the essence of fire, balancing victory and defeat. If water prevails, fire is extinguished; if both perish, they return to the fertile earth. The three natures unite to guard their original essence, sharing a common ancestor. The great victory lies in sesame—consumed regularly as food, it prolongs life. How much more so the returning elixir, refined from metal, water, *wu*, and *ji* into the supreme treasure of heaven and earth? Cultivators who subdue and ingest it attain longevity equal to the sun and moon.\n\nTo subdue is to subdue the primordial qi; to ingest is to swallow the millet-like elixir. Later generations mistakenly write \"ingest\" as \"serve,\" unaware of the subtlety of \"subduing.\" Thus, the immortal masters say: \"Subdue qi, not essence; to ingest essence, one must first subdue qi. Ingesting essence does not grant longevity; longevity requires subduing essence.\" The single word \"subdue\" reverses the mechanism of transformation.\n\nEarth travels through the four seasons—the four seasons being *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei*. Earth has its ruling days in each season, reigning for eighteen days during its \"travels.\" Only in summer, when fire generates earth, does earth’s virtue prevail. Metal fears fire, so when autumn arrives, belonging to the *shen* month, the ancients held that both water and earth are born in *shen*. Earth arises from summer’s fire, while water emerges at the three enclosures, gradually restraining fire. Thus, earth generates metal at the beginning of autumn. Earth’s virtue first reigns for nine days, generating *geng*-metal, and ceases at *xu*, where it divides its reign for nine days.\n\nTo guard boundaries and set rules: in the east, *Di* earth guards the boundary of the Azure Dragon; in the west, *Wei* earth regulates the power of the White Tiger; in the south, *Liu* earth squares the gate of the fire of *Li*; in the north, *Nü* earth stabilizes the door of the water of *Kan*. This enables the restraint of the essence of cinnabar and true metal, which returns to the five viscera. When the elixir first arrives, its qi disperses like mist, moistening like rain. The elixir’s qi, through steaming and permeation, reaches the four limbs. Once the spirit and qi are complete, the complexion becomes joyful, teeth regrow, hair blackens, and the aged return to youth. The withered form is transformed, forever escaping the calamities of the mundane world. Both form and spirit become wondrous—such is the Purple Radiance Perfected.\n\nThis chapter states that to begin refining the elixir, one must first harmonize the *wu* and *ji* earths before gathering metal and water to form the elixir.\n\n*Zi* resides in the north, the proper position of *Kan*, its number one. *Wu* resides in the south, the proper position of *Li*, its number two. Within *Kan* lies earth, called *wu*, its number five. Within *Li* lies earth, called *ji*, its number five. *Wu* presides over the gate of *Kan*, holding the primordial true unity. *Ji* stands at the door of *Li*, accumulating the postnatal utmost true mercury. To seek the primordial unity, one must pass through *wu*-earth; to employ the postnatal mercury, one must subdue it with *ji*-earth. Once *zi* and *wu* are harmonious, and *wu*-earth is harmonized, the essences of the two fives wondrously unite and congeal. *Wu* enters the *ji* crucible, and the two earths coalesce, hence named \"the jade tablet.\" Entering the stone, it becomes *Kun*; *Kun* is the mother of all stones. Without *Kun*, the framework of *Dui* cannot be maintained. *Zi* and *wu* breathe in harmony; *wu* and *ji* nurture and embrace; lead and mercury intertwine as husband and wife.\n\nYellow earth is *wu*-earth; *wu*-earth can generate the metal within *Dui*, thus it is the father of metal. The flowing pearl is wood-mercury; lead-water can nourish the mercury within wood, thus the flowing pearl is the child of water. Lead-water regards *wu*-earth as its dam; *wu*-earth, once settled in the central palace, prevents water from flowing recklessly outward. The Vermilion Bird is the being within *Li*, the essence of fire. When the heart is calm and the qi harmonized, the pulse stabilizes, allowing one to regulate victory and defeat. Water overcomes fire, fire overcomes metal, metal overcomes wood—when all four are extinguished, their merit returns to the fertile earth. Fertile earth is *ji*-earth.\n\nThe three natures are *wu*-metal and water. The gate of *Kan* is called *wu*; the middle line of *Kan* is *Dui*-metal. Metal generates the water of the Great One; once metal generates water, *wu* restrains it—thus the three natures unite to guard their essence. Wood-nature is *ji*-earth; the door within *Li* is called *ji*. When *wu*-metal, water, and *ji*-wood unite, wood gradually overcomes them, transforming all into the great elixir. Thus, it is said that the original nature shares a common ancestor.\n\nThe great victory refers to sesame; if sesame is regularly consumed as food, it can prolong life. How much more so the returning elixir, refined from metal, water, *wu*, and *ji* into the supreme treasure of heaven and earth? Cultivators who subdue and ingest it attain longevity equal to the sun and moon. To subdue is to subdue the primordial qi; to ingest is to swallow the millet-like elixir. Later generations mistakenly write \"ingest\" as \"serve,\" unaware of the subtlety of \"subduing.\" Thus, the immortal masters say: \"Subdue qi, not essence; to ingest essence, one must first subdue qi. Ingesting essence does not grant longevity; longevity requires subduing essence.\" The single word \"subdue\" reverses the mechanism of transformation.\n\n**Chapter Twelve: Uniting Like-Kind in One Body**\n\nWhen ceruse is cast into fire, its color corrupts and reverts to lead; when ice and snow meet warm broth, they dissolve into supreme gold. Cinnabar serves as the master, harmonizing with mercury—its transformations arise from its authenticity, beginning and ending in mutual dependence. Those who seek to refine and ingest the immortal elixir must unite like-kind: just as planting grain requires grain for cover, and hatching chicks demands eggs, so too does *qi* assist the natural process of things to completion. How could fish eyes become pearls? How could mugwort transform into sandalwood? Only like-kind may follow one another; discordant affairs cannot yield treasure. Swallows do not birth phoenixes; foxes and hares do not nurse horses. Water does not flow upward in flames; fire does not moisten downward. In the world, many scholars, though lofty and gifted, meet no opportunity. They exhaust their fire and squander their resources, relying on texts and following words blindly, lacking the threads of causation. Their measures and methods fail; they pound and refine malachite, mica, alum, magnetite, and sulfur, burning cedar clay in mutual refinement. They bellow beneath the Five Stones and copper, using them as aids and pivots. Yet their natures differ—how could they willingly unite as one? A thousand attempts must end in ten thousand failures. They strive in vain, growing foolish with age until their hair turns white. Midway, they spawn doubts, forsaking the Dao to cling to delusion, straying from the true path into crooked byways. Their vision narrows like peering through a tube; how can they fathom the methods of the future?\n\nCeruse is refined black lead; when it meets fire, it returns to its original nature. Ice and snow are congealed cold water; when they encounter warmth, they revert to their source. Gold enters mercury and turns white; when fired, it regains its red hue. The world’s people are ensnared by desires, their natures disordered. Yet preserving one’s nature grants longevity. What does it mean for gold to take cinnabar as its master? What does it mean to harmonize with mercury? Those who cultivate the Dao must clarify these transformations and penetrate yin and yang. To refine the golden elixir, first accumulate the cinnabar of *li*-fire to harmonize with the mercury of the Jade Pool. Then employ the water of *kan* to temper the fire of *li*. When water and fire are balanced, gold and cinnabar unite in form, their transformations arising from the authenticity of like-kind, beginning and ending with the union of female and male.\n\nThus, those who seek to refine and ingest the immortal elixir must rely on like-kind—this is the truth. Just as planting grain requires grain, and hatching chicks requires eggs, so too must those who aspire to become immortals or Buddhas adhere to like-kind. Though one may enter the marketplace a hundred times or sit in meditation for a thousand years, they will ultimately fall into emptiness. Without studying the union of like-kind, pursuing side paths—whether bedroom arts, controlling women, or the Three Peaks’ techniques—are all deviant roads. They mistake fish eyes for pearls and mugwort for sandalwood, unaware that transformations arise from authenticity. Swallows are but flying birds.\n\nThe phoenix cannot be born of foxes or hares, nor beasts of the field; how then could a mare give birth to a foal? These are not of like-kind. Water’s transformation cannot ascend in flame, nor can fire’s power moisten and descend—all because the interplay of yin and yang must follow the Dao of nature. The Immortal Elders teach that one must seek an enlightened master, study the union of like-kind, and harmonize yin and yang before speaking of the elixir.\n\nWhen my master, the Purple Jade Elder, first received instruction from the Perfected One of Great Emptiness, the first question upon entering the chamber was whether the *Cantong Qi* (\"Token for the Agreement of the Three\") clarified the *Yi* (Changes) or facilitated its practice. The Perfected One of Great Emptiness replied: \"The *Yi* consists solely of yin and yang. Only by understanding and practicing these can one become a sage.\" Thus, the *Yi* states: \"In the southwest, one gains companions and proceeds with like-kind.\" The *Cantong Qi* says: \"Like-kind follows in accord; discord fails to form the treasure.\" First, one must understand; afterward, one practices—this is the way of the sage.\n\nYet how many later generations, despite possessing fine and wondrous talents, fail to seek a true master? Instead, they rely on ancient texts, idly speculating and measuring by their own whims. Some use *shao*-era stone gallbladder to refine gold, or *chen*-era cinnabar and silver to burn the elixir. They pound and refine the Five Metals, smelt the Eight Stones, take the Three Yellows as like-kind, and use pure red copper as an auxiliary pivot. But these stones and metals are not of our like-kind—how could they willingly merge with our essence and dwell within our bodies?\n\nIn former times, Minister Zhang of Jiujiang refined and ingested the elixir. Lü Dongbin, pitying his earnest devotion to the Dao, transformed into a scholar to visit and guide him. Zhang, self-assured from long elixir consumption, believed himself certain of ascension and treated Dongbin with scant courtesy. Dongbin abruptly departed, leaving behind a poem on his seat:\n\n*Alas, Minister Zhang of Jiujiang,*\n*Ingesting elixirs, he lost his sight;*\n*His spirit withered, his qi dried up.*\n*He never thought to return to the rootless elixir,*\n*But vainly consumed metal and stone—how foolish!*\n*In the end, his eyes failed, and he perished.*\n\nSuch men, lacking true talent and clinging stubbornly to their ways, willingly suffer the misguidance of blind masters. They mistake metal and stone for like-kind, squandering their wealth on refining and ingestion, often meeting their end without ever daring to abandon their errors. Like those who peer at the sky through a tube, how could they know that true immortals and sagely masters exist in the world? People, habituated to the commonplace, neither seek inquiry nor strive to visit masters widely. Their narrow vision and lowly gaze are unfit to perceive lofty and distant matters. Yet they strut about, calling themselves great men—all while squandering their fine and wondrous talents through self-reliance and complacency.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: The Foreknowledge of the Three Sages**\n\nThe utmost sage is none other than Fuxi, who first drew the Eight Trigrams, modeling them on heaven and earth. King Wen of the Zhou dynasty, the ancestor of emperors, structured the trigrams and composed the line statements. Confucius, the most eminent of sages, added the Ten Wings to assist them. These three lords, raised by heaven, arose in succession to govern their times. Though their merits and virtues differed in degree, their creations followed one another, each building upon the last. Weighing the tangible is easy; measuring the formless is difficult. Their works established models for the world, and their *Book of Poetry* and *Book of Documents* lacked prior foreknowledge, relying instead on their masters’ awakening—like the bright moon emerging from behind a cold curtain. They ascended the high terrace, and the *Fire Records* of six hundred chapters differed not in essence from written words. Yet people do not deeply ponder or trace the origins of these texts, though the obscure and manifest share a common dwelling.\n\nHow could a worthy discuss these matters lightly? If I were to remain silent and cut off the Dao, I would incur punishment. Yet to express my thoughts on bamboo and silk might risk leaking heavenly secrets. Hesitant and sighing, I humbly record these foolish words. Though the crafting of the Dao follows principles, I cannot fully expound them here. I shall briefly outline the essentials, and the branches will naturally become clear.\n\n**Chapter Eight: On Preceding and Following the Yellow and the Old**\n\nThe Yellow Emperor and Laozi—two great sages—here elucidate the teachings of the Three Sages and their transmitted instructions. Their reverence for the sages of old and those to come is evident. Looking back at later scholars, who know nothing yet recklessly boast and slander—what punishment do their crimes deserve?\n\nThe *Classic* states: \"The utmost sage is none other than Fuxi.\" Fuxi is also written as Paoxi or Fuxi. Confucius’ *Wings* say: \"In ancient times, when Paoxi ruled the world, he looked up to observe the patterns of heaven and down to model himself on the earth. He studied the markings of birds and beasts and the suitability of the land, drawing near to his own body and far to external things. Thus, he first drew the Eight Trigrams to communicate the virtue of spiritual illumination and to accord with the nature of the myriad things.\" King Wen structured the trigrams and composed the line statements, noting in the southwest: \"One gains companions.\" What subtle meaning does this hold? The Ten Wings assist the *Yi*.\n\nThe *Yi* consists of two parts: the *Zhengjing* (Main Classic). Fuxi drew the trigrams, King Wen composed the line statements, and the Duke of Zhou wrote the line texts—together forming two chapters. Confucius added ten chapters as wings: the *Upper and Lower Commentaries on the Judgments*, the *Great and Small Images*, the *Appended Remarks* (upper and lower), the *Words of the Text*, and the *Discussion of the Trigrams* (upper, middle, and lower)—ten chapters in all. These are called the Ten Wings, not \"explanations\" but \"wings,\" for they assist the Dao of the *Yi*.\n\nThe sages, venerating those before and modeling those after, made the *Classic* the classic and the *Wings* the wings, so that later scholars would know that sages dare not surpass their predecessors or disorder the *Main Classic*. From Shang Qu to Fei Meng and Liangqiu Fei, Fei said: \"The *Judgment* texts explain the *Classic*, so the two wings were placed beneath each hexagram.\" Fei’s *Yi* disrupted the sacred classic. Fei Zhi did not understand the sages’ intent to neither precede nor disorder. If the sacred classic could be disordered, Confucius would have long since separated and explained it.\n\nFei’s tradition continued to Zheng Kangcheng, who followed Fei’s teachings. Zheng said: \"The *Wenyan* commentary explains the Qian and Kun trigrams,\" so he moved it after Qian and Kun. Later, Wang Bi followed Fei and Zheng. Wang said: \"The *Xiang* explains the lines,\" so he moved it after each line statement, adding \"Xiang says\" and \"Tuan says.\" Within a few hundred years, the *Yi* was disordered thrice. The *Main Classic* was disrupted, and the *Wings* were lost. Fei Zhi began the corruption, and Zheng and Wang followed. Today’s *Yi* is not the *Zhou Yi* but the *Yi* of Wang Bi.\n\nMany former worthies sought to restore the *Zhou Yi*’s wings. In the Song dynasty, Li Tao, Chao Yuezhi, and Ouyang Xiu all attempted to collate and establish the *Zhou Yi*, believing it to be the ancient *Yi*. Li Tao said: \"The *Zhou Yi*’s twelve chapters were first disordered by Fei, greatly confused by Wang Bi, and then restored and collated as the *Ancient Yi*, printed at the prefectural school.\" Chao Yuezhi re-established the *Ancient Yi*, with the *Main Classic* in two chapters and the Ten Wings in ten chapters. The *Shuogua* (Discussion of the Trigrams) in two chapters was lost. Ouyang Xiu said: \"The Qin fires preserved the *Yi*’s *Main Classic* for divination, so the Ten Wings’ texts scattered among the people. Emperor Wen of Han widely sought texts, but only the *Tuan*, *Xiang*, *Xici*, and *Wenyan* remained. Later, during Emperor Xuan’s reign, a woman from the Yellow River region unearthed a tomb and found a complete *Yi*, which she presented to the court. The *Shuogua*’s middle and lower chapters were damaged beyond recognition. Thus, two wings of the Ten Wings were truly lost. Later generations used the *Xugua* and *Zagua* to complete the Ten Wings, but this is incorrect.\"\n\nThe wording is shallow, and later Confucians merely echoed one another. Only Master Cheng possessed a vision of true insight. In his posthumous writings, he stated: \"The *Xugua* does not embody the profound essence of the *Yi*; this contradicts the Dao.\" Later, Zhang Zai, with a single stroke of the master craftsman’s axe, refuted this—yet this too was incorrect. Only Master Cheng recognized that two chapters were truly lost.\n\nZhu Zhen said: \"Only the *Gan* trigram constitutes the original text of the *Zhouyi*.\" Wang Bi dared not disrupt it. Zhu Xi said: \"The *Zhouyi*’s two chapters of the *Main Classic* comprise Fu Xi’s trigrams, King Wen and the Duke of Zhou’s words, and the ten chapters of commentary composed by Confucius—altogether twelve chapters. Amidst considerable confusion introduced by later Confucians, I have now thoroughly rectified and restored them: two chapters of the *Main Classic* with annotations, and ten chapters of the Wings, thus reviving the original structure of Confucius’ edition.\" From Zhu Xi’s time to the present, two hundred years have passed, yet the original has still not been restored. This is for a reason: without the Ten Wings, how could the *Yi*’s Dao be elucidated? How could its words convey transformation? How could its movements reveal the principles of *zhiqi* (instrument-making)? How could its images serve as the Dao?\n\nIf the Dao does not flow through words, one cannot grasp the resonance of human nature and emotions. If the Dao does not comprehend change and movement, one cannot fathom the transformations of metal and water. If the Dao does not master *zhiqi*, one cannot employ the crucible and furnace. If the Dao does not discern fortune and misfortune, one cannot understand the principles of reversal and compliance. The Wings state: \"The *Yi* contains the four Dao of the sages\"—this is precisely so. Therefore, when a noble person is about to act...\n\nWhen about to act or proceed, one inquires and, through words, receives the mandate—as if an echo, without regard to distance or depth, one thereby knows what is to come. For depth is precisely what is called \"elusive and obscure, dim and dark.\" When a noble person acts or proceeds, it must be within this elusive and obscure, dim and dark, that they know what is to come. If not for the utmost refinement in the world, who could partake in this? The immortal elder’s words on the Ten Wings as an aid are thus exhaustive.\n\nThe sages’ efforts benefit all equally in later ages, yet one fears that scholars may lack great good fortune or great wisdom, rendering them unfit to bear it. A thousand kinds of obstructions arise, leaving no means to witness or hear. The Three Sages arose in succession, creating and measuring, establishing a model for ten thousand generations. We must revere the supreme Dao: heaven-born sages and wise ones—how could they have awakened on their own? They necessarily relied on teachers’ instruction. Even if one possesses intelligence, planning, and deliberation, it is as if something obstructs. Yet if a benevolent and worthy person devotes their mind to thorough inquiry and suddenly gains a teacher’s guidance, their heart and mind become open and clear—just as if, within a chamber, the curtains were drawn back, revealing all distinctly and penetratingly, or as if, with eyes closed, one ascended a high terrace: what would not be seen?\n\nIf one does not seek a teacher, how could one awaken? Should one have a teacher, one must first examine the *Cantong Qi* (The Seal of the Unity of the Three). If one can clarify every sentence and thoroughly comprehend every chapter, this is true attainment. But if even a single phrase remains vague or ambiguous, it cannot be trusted. Apart from this text, to claim there is another path to accomplish the Dao is a great deception of others. Why? Because this text is what King Wen, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius inherited from Fuxi.\n\nThus, the immortal elder said: \"Among the sages beneath ten thousand generations, who could surpass Confucius?\"\n\nAlas! Moreover, the *Yinfu Jing* of the Yellow Emperor, three hundred characters in length, and the *Daode Jing* of Laozi, five thousand in all, align without discrepancy—only when this Dao is understood. Thus, the Celestial Master Lao, Ge, Xu, and Fuqiu, along with all the immortals, entered the Way through this. Likewise, the *Wuzhen Pian* of Ziyang, the *Yuanduzi*, the *Jindan Nanwen*, and other texts all trace their origins to the *Cantong Qi*.\n\nExamine this: Buddhist scriptures and Daoist canons all accord with it. If someone claims, \"My teacher is so-and-so, and their teacher was so-and-so,\" their teachings flow like a river, yet when questioned on the *Cantong Qi*, they are largely ignorant. These are seeds of hell, who falsely assert that the supreme Dao is not found in texts, deceiving and blindly leading others. Who knows that this text alone is the true touchstone? Only when its authenticity is verified can one begin practice.\n\nFurthermore, the *Huoji Liu Bai* speaks of timings, hexagrams, secret words, and profound phrases—from beginning to end, it expounds with solemnity. Yet people do not deeply ponder or seek its source and flow, nor do they understand why the hidden and the manifest dwell together. This text is spoken for the worthy; how could it be lightly recounted? If one were to remain silent about the Way, how could it be transmitted? Yet to fully reveal it in writing would be to leak heavenly signs. Those who hesitate and sigh in regret resemble the creature called *youyu*. This beast, by nature indecisive, dwells in the mountains; hearing a sound, it hesitates between climbing a tree or descending, unable to decide—hence its name. The immortal elder himself said: \"Hesitating at the riverbank, fearing one’s neighbor, I sigh repeatedly, weighing and composing this text.\"\n\nYet, in refining later generations, the method is subtly revealed, though its oral instructions cannot be fully expounded. Here, only the essentials are outlined, with a glimpse of the branches.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: The Knife and the Measure of Golden Elixir**\n\nUse gold as a dike to guide the water, which then flows leisurely. The calculation of gold is fifteen, and the number of water is the same. When tending the furnace, fix the weights: five parts of water are excessive, two are authentic. Gold weighs as at its origin; the third part does not enter the fire. The two join together, and the three substances mutually embrace, transforming as if divine. Below, the qi of the Great Yang steams and seethes; in an instant, it first liquefies, then congeals, called the Yellow Chariot.\n\nAs years and months draw to an end, harm befalls longevity. The body becomes like ash and dust, resembling dust on a bright window. Pound and combine them, then hold them and enter the Crimson Gate. Secure its borders and ensure its completeness and firmness. Kindle the blazing fire below, day and night, with unceasing effort. Begin with civil methods, end with martial; observe and wait, adding caution. Scrutinize and adjust the cold and warmth, cycling through the twelve nodes. When each node is exhausted, one must personally draw in the qi. As life nears its end, cease death. The hun and po transform in color, turning crimson, and suddenly the Reverted Elixir is complete. Grind it into a single pill; the knife and measure are most divine.\n\nThe immortal elder expounds thus far to speak of entering the chamber, tending the furnace, beginning the work, and congealing the elixir within the crucible.\n\nThose of superior capacity should understand this text, proceeding in order without straying. The *Cantong Qi* is a single book; this chapter is of great significance, without which later generations would have no means to begin the practice of elixir refinement. Those who have not encountered a teacher or do not know this text find it profoundly abstruse. Upon reaching this chapter, it is as tasteless as chewing wax, with no entry point. They can only guess it refers to forging the Five Metals and Eight Stones, ultimately achieving nothing, then blame the sagely teachers for deceit—truly pitiable.\n\nNow, I slightly reveal the secret to dispel future doubts: \"Use gold as a dike\" refers to the great cultivator who, in refining the Ninefold Reverted Golden Elixir, must understand that this gold is the gold of the West, within *Dui*. First, establish a sincere heart to seek the *Dui* gold, set up an altar, and constantly maintain vigilance. Fortify the dike to await the generation of this gold’s water.\n\nThe water thus generated must be carefully measured and discerned: is it primordial water or postnatal water? If postnatal, the water is turbid and cannot be used to refine the Reverted Elixir. If primordial, one must wait until the water is clear before using it.\n\nA poem says:\n*The Jing is clear, the Wei is turbid*—\nthe Jing River is clear, the Wei River turbid.\nThe cultivator of the elixir awaits the clarity of the Jing River, flowing leisurely and guarded, without disturbance. This is called \"the water enters and flows leisurely.\" Within this clear water lies true gold. Zhou Xingsi said: \"Gold is born in the Li River, its clarity supreme.\"\n\nMoreover, one must know its weight and measure before use. This *Dui* gold must be approximately fifteen taels in weight, roughly equivalent to one catty. Thus, it is said: \"The calculation of gold is fifteen.\" When the gold weighs fifteen taels, it can generate the Li River’s water.\n\nWhat is meant by \"the number of water is the same\"? It does not mean the water is also fifteen taels, but that water and gold must correspond. Fifteen taels of gold will generate a certain amount of water, hence \"the same.\" Therefore, the immortal elder repeatedly emphasizes: when tending the furnace, first fix the weights. If fifteen taels of gold have generated five parts of water, the water is excessive and unusable—thus, \"five parts of water are excessive.\" If the *Dui* gold initially generates two parts of water, this is truly usable—thus, \"two are authentic.\" This two parts of water must correspond to fifteen taels of gold—thus, \"gold weighs as at its origin.\" If the water reaches three parts, it is also unusable—thus, \"the third does not enter.\" When the quantities of gold and water are timely and equal, swiftly combine them with two parts of fire—thus, \"fire, two, joins them.\" Once gold, water, and fire are combined, the fire receives the gold’s essence and is further restrained by the water, congealing into the Reverted Elixir, which transforms as if divine.\n\nAt the moment of beginning the furnace work, nothing is more crucial. Thus, the sage takes the month from the year, places gold within the month, measures the day by the tide, and selects the hour by the hexagram. Within the hour, the fire is fixed, and the talisman is enacted.\n\nWhat is \"enacting the talisman\"? The ancient sages and worthies regarded the refinement of the Golden Elixir as a great affair. They calculated the timings and established the clustered method: seventy-two seasonal nodes clustered into one day, three hundred sixty hexagrams gathered into one month, thirty-six talismans accounting for one day and night, divided among the twelve hours. Each hour contains six nodes; in elixir refinement, only two nodes are used. Each hour has one hexagram; in elixir refinement, less than half a hexagram’s duration is needed. Each hour has three talismans; in elixir refinement, only one talisman’s speed is used—this is the so-called \"single talisman, single decision.\"\n\nThus, the Yellow Emperor spoke of the *Yinfu*: \"People know the divine, but the divine does not know why it is divine.\" The immortal refining the elixir, in the span of one talisman, compresses the three thousand six hundred true breaths, reversing and drawing them into the womb. At this moment, they seize the creation of heaven and earth, the essence of the sun and moon. The earth’s axis and the heart of heaven are in hand; the dragon and tiger exchange their breaths, pounding the true unity of gold and water. The snake coils within the elixir furnace; the crow and hare move along the Yellow Path. Black and white intermingle, hardness and softness alternate. The jade crucible stores auspiciousness; purple radiance reflects the sun. Mars guards the western extreme; the Vermilion Bird blazes in the sky. It urges the water to move the gold, hastens the fire into the crucible, and steams with the qi of the Great Yang, congealing the elixir called the Yellow Chariot.\n\nWhen first refining the gold and water, one calculates the embankments by years and months, yet at the moment of compounding the elixir, only the work of a single *fu* is required. Prolonged effort damages one’s nature and harms the elixir; a single misstep injures one’s lifespan. Thus, as the years and months draw to a close, to damage one’s nature and shorten one’s years—when the very purpose of cultivating the elixir is to prolong life and ascend to transcendence—would be to err by a hair’s breadth and instead harm one’s longevity.\n\nTherefore, the immortal elders instruct later students: one must be cautious and meticulous. The dust on a bright window is likened to the subtlety of the elixir; the pounding and refining are the intermingling and tempering of yin and yang; the holding and entry are the preservation and reception of the elixir. The Crimson Gate is the portal of *qian*; the elixir returns through *qian*’s portal to the chamber of spirit. To \"seal firmly\" is to close the breath; \"guarding the boundaries\" refers to the nine orifices—all must be secure and complete, without any loss. The blazing fire below must burn day and night with unceasing vigilance, for when the yang elixir first arrives, it bears a sign: the fire within *li* is suddenly obtained, circulating day and night throughout the body. The hundred joints and ten thousand spirits all obey its command. One must diligently guard within, ensuring the breath is tranquil, the intent harmonious, the *qi* even, and the pulse stilled—only then does the elixir begin to congeal.\n\nAt first, one employs civil fire to refine the elixir, but both the beginning and the end require martial fire: martial fire to refine at the outset, martial fire to warm and nurture at the conclusion. Thus, the *Song of the Crucible* says: \"Martial at the start, martial at the end, civil in between.\" One must observe with utmost care, for negligence is not permissible. The *Mud Pill Palace* states: \"If the work is not thorough, it will not be round.\" In regulating cold and warmth, one must not be deceived by external influences. As Master Ziyang said: \"Adjust the fire’s timing, entrusting it to yin and yang.\"\n\nThis cycle continues through the twelve nodes, beginning anew each time, until the cinnabar draws out the lead, the lead is nearly exhausted, and the mercury dries. The seven *po* are dead, the *hun* transformed—this is the moment when the thread of life is about to snap, when the *hun* and *po* are on the verge of departure. Yet at this very juncture, the color shifts to that of the returning elixir: radiant purple-gold and crimson.\n\nWhen powdered and lifted, a single grain—no larger than a millet seed, as light as the seven *daogui*—is most wondrous. Its divine efficacy defies description. This chapter exhaustively describes the work of beginning the practice, yet the subtle and profound precautions must be transmitted orally by a master. Who could rely solely on the text to accomplish the task?\n\nJia Maoxiang of former worthies longed to hear the utmost Dao but, lacking a teacher’s guidance, devoted himself passionately to this book. In his declining years, in a letter replying to Minister Cai, he wrote: “The *Cantong qi* was never intended to elucidate the *Book of Changes*; it merely borrowed the method of ‘lodging stems within hexagrams’ to convey the timing of advance and retreat in practice.” Yet even one as learned as Master Zhu, without a teacher’s instruction, mistook it for a method of “lodging stems.” How could he know that this book directly expounds the Dao of the *Zhou Changes*? Thus it is called *The Seal of the Three in Accord with the Zhou Changes*. Moreover, the timing of advance and retreat in the practice of the elixir Way does not employ the method of “lodging stems.”\n\nElsewhere he wrote: “On the road, I carried no other books, and thus was able to study and become thoroughly familiar with the *Cantong qi*. I could roughly grasp its literary meaning, for though I had read it many times before, I had always found it tasteless and set it aside. Only now have I begun to discern its thread. Yet I have not yet understood its ingredients or cavities.” The profound words of the mysterious are unfathomable and beyond conception. Master Zhu repeatedly found it tasteless and cast it aside, while blind teachers insist on guessing at its meaning. He also wrote: “In the past, whenever I wished to study it, I could not find its gateway or where to begin. If even sages and worthies require a teacher, how could one like me, sharing the same wisdom as Confucius and Mencius, presume to proceed without one? Today, people are self-satisfied, recklessly guessing and acting. Compared to the former worthies, their transgressions are many indeed.”\n\nHad Master Zhu received a teacher’s instruction, he would surely have understood that the sagely Dao of the *Book of Changes* is not merely a book of divination.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: The Natures of Water and Fire**\n\nExpounding the numbers of the Five Phases, it is concise yet not verbose. Water excites fire, and suddenly the light is extinguished. The sun and moon mutually eclipse, always at the new and full moons. When water flourishes, *kan* encroaches upon yang; when fire wanes, *li* darkens the day. Yin and yang consume each other, and their mutual interaction is the natural Dao. “Name” is used to define *qing*; “character” is used to speak of *xing*. When metal comes to return to *xing* in its initial state, only then is it called the Returned Elixir. I dare not speak falsely, but follow the words of the sages. The ancient records speak of the *Dragon and Tiger*, the Yellow Emperor’s *Golden Flower*, Huainan’s *Refinement of Autumn Stone*, and Yuyang’s *Yellow Sprout*. The worthy may practice it; the unworthy should not partake. From ancient times to the present, the Dao arises from a single pair. In discourse, scholars must strive diligently, ponder deeply, and hold fast to the essential. The words are utterly clear and do not deceive me.\n\nThe numbers of the Five Phases—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth—are extended to the numbers three, five, and one. In refining the golden elixir, lead, mercury, silver, cinnabar, and earth are taken as the Five Phases and matched with yin and yang. That water can extinguish fire means that yin can dissolve yang. The mutual eclipsing of the sun and moon must occur at the new and full moons, where the waxing and waning of yin and yang encroach upon each other. If yin and yang harmonize and mutually consume one another, then naturally there arises the Dao of their interaction.\n\nMetal and water share the name *qing*; wood and fire share the character *xing*. *Qing* resides in the northwest; *xing* governs the southeast. The southeast is called “self”; the northwest is called “other.” The *qing* of metal and water naturally comes from without to overcome wood and fire. The *xing* of wood and fire inwardly returns to congeal the golden elixir. This is what is meant by “when metal comes to return to *xing* in its initial state, only then is it called the Returned Elixir.” These two lines are the marrow of the *Cantong qi*.\n\nI dare not speak falsely but follow the words of the sages. The immortal elder obtained the true transmission of the sages and also acquired the ancient text of the *Dragon and Tiger Classic*. Practicing refinement according to its method, he attained the elixir and composed this book to instruct later generations. He recounted the Yellow Emperor’s attainment of the elixir as the *Golden Flower*, Huainan’s attainment as *Autumn Stone*, and Yuyang’s attainment as the *Yellow Sprout*. Each, upon ascending, established a name—yet all were this Returned Elixir, all were the primordial unity of qi, all were the same substance.\n\nLater people, hearing of the *Golden Flower*, guessed it to be the five metals; hearing of the *Yellow Sprout*, guessed it to be the eight minerals; hearing of *Autumn Stone*, guessed it to be urine and excrement. How could they know that the ancient sages and former worthies established these names as expedient means? The elixir they refined emerges from nothing beyond yin and yang—there is no other path. This Dao can only be diligently practiced by sages. From ancient times to the present, it has been a single Way. The great sages of the Three Teachings must be of the same kind to apply their efforts. Thus it is said: “From ancient times to the present, the Dao arises from a single pair in discourse and planning.” Beyond this one path, there is no other method. Those who come after must strive diligently, ponder deeply, and seek a teacher’s instruction. Then they will know that this book is utterly clear and does not deceive.\n\nShangyang said: “The three chapters of the *Cantong qi* are distinct in substance and function, their efficacy wondrous and not trifling. *Can* refers to the substance of Heaven and Earth’s creative transformation; *tong* draws upon the same source of generation and completion; *qi* unites the efficacy of creative transformation and generation. The upper chapter recounts the beginning and end of elixir refinement; the middle chapter arranges its subtle and profound precautions; the lower chapter supplements omissions and lost correspondences. The upper chapter corresponds in meaning to the *Dragon and Tiger Upper Classic*, and the world doubts that the *Dragon and Tiger Classic* must have been composed later, taking the upper chapter of the *Cantong qi* as its classic. Yet it must also have had middle and lower classics. Without middle and lower classics, how could it be called an upper classic? The mind of the sage is not something the common people can fathom. The upper classic is the first classic—this is certainly not something the ordinary can measure. Moreover, the book contains the phrase ‘ancient record of the *Dragon and Tiger*,’ which clarifies that it is an ancient text. What doubt remains? Thus it is said: ‘The ancient text in gold and jade.’”\n\nThe Realized Person Peng Xiao’s preface states: “I do not know from whom the immortal elder received instruction, but he obtained the ancient text of the *Dragon and Tiger Classic* and fully grasped its wondrous transmission. He then condensed the *Book of Changes* to compose the three chapters of the *Cantong qi*. Yet, not having exhausted its finest subtleties, he further wrote *Supplementing Omissions and Rectifying Errors* to elaborate the profound mysteries of the elixir classics.” It is said that the immortal elder first received the transmission from the Realized Person Yin Changsheng, then later studied under Attendant Xu. Thus he fully mastered the profound mysteries of the immortal transmission. The *True One* records in detail that after completing the book, he secretly transmitted it to Attendant Xu of Qingzhou. Xu’s given name was *You*, and he annotated it. Thus the source and flow are true—what need is there to debate it? There are over a hundred commentaries on this book, but only those by Peng Xiao and Wang Dao are superior. Peng Xiao received the transmission from his teacher, and his *Bright Mirror Diagram* and preface to the *Cantong qi* are already detailed and clear. Yet his commentary on this book remains fragmented, giving rise to the saying: “Ditches and streams flow in different directions; beauty and ugliness arise in turn.” Wang Dao’s explanations are even more vast and barren.\n\nNow, the *Dragon and Tiger Classic*’s language, though lofty and ancient, is not as clear and decisive as the *Cantong qi*. Its words are profound and wondrous—without the sagely teacher’s precise instructions on where to begin, who would dare conjecture? Following “when metal comes to return to *xing* in its initial state, only then is it called the Returned Elixir,” it immediately states: “I dare not speak falsely but follow the words of the sages.” From this, we know that the ancient sages and great worthies, without a teacher, would not dare speak falsely. Without a teacher, how could this book have been composed? Without a teacher, how could one harmonize with creative transformation?\n\nThe preservation of this book in the world is the sagely mind and Daoist vision—a celestial ladder and river raft for the practitioner, upon which those who cultivate the Way depend. Without this book, all would turn to heterodox paths and deviant byways, where blind masters and vulgar charlatans fabricate empty marvels, leading and dragging one another into hell. Without this book, there would be no path of cultivation between Heaven and Earth, no Dao of the sages. How then could one aspire to the ceaseless progress of all under Heaven? Reflect deeply upon this, and the immortal elder’s intent will be as clear as Heaven itself.\n\nIn general, to annotate a book is to elucidate it. Since its profound mysteries are difficult to perceive, explanations are offered to enlighten later generations. Thus, one must grasp the book’s original meaning, surpass the mental constraints of predecessors, and achieve luminous clarity—only then can the annotations surpass the original text. Otherwise, one place remains obscure, another unresolved, and instead of guiding future learners, one obstructs their wisdom, narrowing their vision and hearing. Do not assume that those who come later are inferior to those of today. If Heaven were to raise a sage or worthy to rectify and rescue the age, they would be mired in turbidity, unable to distinguish purity or restore correctness.\n\nAmong other scriptures, few compare to this book. When Master Boyang faced the two perfected ones, Yin and Xu, he bowed in reverence to the true and upright Dao. Its lofty composition and profound, hidden mysteries admit no carelessness in even a single word—how much more so for the wondrous methods of the Golden Elixir, the crucible’s cavities, and their functions? Yet Boyang encapsulated all with the single phrase, “when metal comes to return to *xing* in its initial state.” The Song Confucians, failing to comprehend, refused to clarify the *Zhouyi*’s Dao, reducing it entirely to a book of divination. They obscured the sagely minds of Fuxi, King Wen, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius, dimmed the *Qian* and *Kun* hexagrams’ principles of natural generation and reversal, and wrongly constrained Boyang’s meticulous transmission of the profound truth. If we do not now reveal some of its key apertures, the intentions of the Four Sages will remain unfulfilled for ten thousand generations, and the *Zhouyi*’s Dao will never be illuminated. How could they not know that its most essential words are utterly manifest, shining brightly, never deceiving us in the least?\n\n*Commentary on the Zhouyi Cantong qi, Divided into Chapters, Volume One*\n\n*Commentary on the Zhouyi Cantong qi, Divided into Chapters, Volume Two*\n*Section: \"The Essence of Yin and Yang Qi,\" Chapter Sixteen*\n*By Chen Zhixu of the Yuan Dynasty*\n*From the Imperial Four Treasuries, Section: Masters, Daoist Works*\n\nThe *Qian* and *Kun* unite in hard and soft, embracing one another—yang holds while yin receives, male and female mutually dependent, thereby generating the essence of creation. Then *Kan* and *Li* rise to the fore, their radiance spreading forth, profound and unfathomable, beyond all depiction. The sage measures and arranges them in order, tracing back to the primordial foundation. These four intermingle, entering directly into the formless void. The sixty hexagrams unfold in a vast expanse, serving as the chariot; the dragon and horse are harnessed, and the enlightened ruler takes the reins. When times are harmonious, one follows the level path, for crooked ways are perilous and treacherous, endangering the state.\n\nThe first fifteen chapters of the *Upper Scroll* have already clarified the sequence of elixir refinement from beginning to end. This section revisits its subtleties, enumerating them chapter by chapter—this is the convergence of the Nine Returns Great Elixir, the essential application for later learners. One must delve deeply and comprehend thoroughly; hesitation or carelessness risks even the slightest deviation, and the elixir will not form. Master Shangyang divided this *Middle Scroll* into fifteen chapters, enumerating fifteen matters. This chapter alone elucidates the fourfold essence of yin and yang.\n\nWhat are these four? *Qian* is the firm principle, *Kun* the yielding. Confucius’ *Wings* states: *Qian* is the yang thing, *Kun* the yin thing. Yin and yang unite in virtue, and hard and soft take form, embodying the workings of Heaven and Earth, penetrating the power of the numinous. Thus, the virtue of *Qian* is firm, strong, centered, upright, and the pure essence of unalloyed yang. The virtue of *Kun* is soft, compliant, beneficial, and steadfast—this is the path the noble person follows. *Qian* and *Kun* in union are the Dao of the Golden Elixir. Only the noble person can follow this path; the petty person does the opposite. Formerly, Confucius said: “I have never seen a truly firm person.” Someone replied: “Shen Cheng is firm.” Confucius said: “Cheng is full of desire—how can he be firm?” The meaning of firmness is truly great.\n\nAlas! The petty person may force himself to be firm and strong for a time, yet how can he be centered and upright? If he cannot be centered and upright, how can his essence be pure? Now, firmness is the nature of *Qian*—it moves directly, thus is easily known. Softness is the nature of *Kun*—it moves by yielding, thus is easily followed. What is easily known gains affinity; what is easily followed achieves success. With affinity and success, greatness and endurance are possible—this is the virtue and work of the sage. Can one attain position through this? Is this not the Dao of the Golden Elixir, the mean between firmness and softness?\n\nThus, the virtue of *Qian* yang governs bestowal, while the virtue of *Kun* yin specializes in containment and receptivity. Male and female depend on each other, relying on essence and *qi*. When essence and *qi* spread forth, the *Wings* say: essence and *qi* are things; the wandering soul is transformation. As things, they follow the natural course to generate life—this is the birth of humans and all beings. As transformation, they are employed in reverse to achieve accomplishment—this is the making of Buddhas and immortals.\n\nWhat are *Kan* and *Li* at the head? When *Qian* the firm intermingles with *Kun*, *Qian* becomes hollow at its center and transforms into *Li*. When *Kun* the soft receives *Qian*, *Kun* becomes replete within and transforms into *Kan*. Thus, *Kan* and *Li* follow *Qian* and *Kun*, standing at the forefront of yin and yang, attaining the mean of firmness and softness. *Li* holds the sun’s light at its center; *Kan* holds the moon’s radiance. Their luminous brilliance descends below, profound and subtle, beyond measure, beyond depiction. Only the sage can fathom and expound their primal foundation. This meaning aligns with the earlier discussion of primordial essence—both are abstruse and difficult to gauge, their effects verified by signs.\n\nWhat are the four—yin, yang, essence, and *qi*—intermingled in chaos? These four are contained within the aperture of emptiness, then unfold as the sixty-four hexagrams, spreading forth as a chariot. *Kun* is the ox, the chariot; *Qian* is the dragon, the horse. When *Qian* and *Kun* unite in virtue, dragon and horse are harnessed, and the world attains peace under the bright ruler’s governance. The Golden Fluid Returned Elixir shares this same Dao. Why? The dragon is the water of the eastern direction; the horse is the cinnabar fire of the south. When dragon and horse obtain the metal tiger of the west to generate the *xuanwu* water of the north, essence and *qi* congeal into form, and the harnessing is complete.\n\nHarmony ensures smooth travel without deviation—this is the bright ruler’s governance, moving along the great road without burdening the people. If harmony follows the seasons, all responds accordingly. Should one stray from the right path, resorting to deceit to obstruct the worthy and envy the capable, the state will be imperiled. Thus, when the nine ministers of old departed, loyal ministers advanced, and the An Lushan rebellion began to sprout. When Qin Hui was employed, Yue Fei perished, and the lands of Yan and Yun were never reclaimed. Those who exert themselves for the state fear only that power may not rest with the ruler; petty persons, acting for themselves, fear only that authority may not belong to them.\n\nIn every age, noble persons and petty persons coexist. When the noble person harmonizes and accommodates the petty, and the petty follows and submits to the noble, the state avoids peril, and the world is well-governed. In cultivation, harmony comes first. With harmony, all affairs follow the heart’s intent and respond accordingly. The *Wings* say: “The auspiciousness of *Dui* lies in action without doubt.” Once affairs are harmonized, the heart must be rectified, intentions made sincere, and vigilance maintained against peril. Then, no obstacles will lead to ruin, and the Elixir will not fail. Can one afford not to be cautious of even the slightest deviation?\n\nThe following twenty-eight chapters further elucidate these four matters in greater detail.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: The Noble Person Dwelling in His Chamber**\nWhen the noble person dwells in his chamber and utters good words, they resonate a thousand *li* away. How much more so for those nearby? The ruler of ten thousand chariots, abiding in his ninefold chamber, issues decrees and commands in accord with yin and yang, storing his instruments and awaiting the proper time without transgression. The hexagram *Zhun* corresponds to the months of *zi* and *shen*, while *Meng* aligns with *yin* and *xu*. The remaining sixty hexagrams each have their appointed days. Here, two images are briefly presented, though their full intricacies cannot be exhaustively explored. When establishing intentions and enacting punishments, benevolence is applied and virtue bestowed. To oppose this brings misfortune; to follow it brings fortune.\n\nAccording to the calendar, when decrees are issued with utmost sincerity, close attention must be paid to the celestial stems and earthly branches, carefully observing waxing and waning. Even the slightest deviation brings regret and harm. At the solstices, the measurements change; errors and distortions accumulate. In the depths of winter, scorching heat; in the height of summer, frost and snow. At the equinoxes, imbalance reigns—timekeeping falters, drought and flood contend, wind and rain fail to follow their seasons, locusts surge forth, and myriad anomalies emerge. Heaven displays its omens; mountains collapse and the earth splits. The filial son’s concentrated mind moves the August Ultimate. Nearby, his words issue from his own mouth; afar, they flow into distant lands—sometimes summoning calamity, sometimes bringing fortune, sometimes creating great peace, sometimes inciting war. These four outcomes arise from this.\n\nWithin the breast, movement and stillness have their constancy, adhering to the marking line. The four seasons follow their proper order, harmonizing with *qi*. Firmness and softness are balanced, not encroaching upon one another. The five phases guard their boundaries, neither recklessly expanding nor contracting. The *Yi* circulates freely, bending and extending, returning and reversing.\n\nThis chapter is most crucial for the initial precautions when entering the chamber—meticulous and subtle are the wonders of Elixir refinement. The sage uses the noble person as a metaphor. The *Appended Judgments* of the *Yi* states: “When the noble person dwells in his chamber and utters good words, they resonate a thousand *li* away—how much more so for those nearby?” It also says: “Words and actions are the noble person’s hinge and trigger. The release of hinge and trigger determines honor and disgrace. Words and actions are how the noble person moves Heaven and Earth.” Further: “One deliberates before speaking, discusses before acting. Deliberation and discussion bring about transformation.”\n\nMaster Shangyang says: The Dao is fundamentally wordless—without words, how could it be revealed? To speak of the wordless refers to the virtuous person, whose words cannot be careless. How much more so for those who practice the Dao and refine the Elixir? Laozi says: “The knowing do not speak; the speaking do not know.” Those who flaunt dry wisdom and lack true knowledge—when they expound and debate, they seek only to be known. A true teacher can discern their deceit and shallowness, and such vessels will not lightly discuss the Purple Yang’s teachings. Master Ziyang says: “Even with cauldrons before me and blades at my neck, I dare not speak.” If this is the case for one truly practicing the Dao, how can one not speak? Yet when entering the chamber to gather the medicine, one must avoid careless words. If one does not speak at all, how can the medicine’s authenticity be ascertained?\n\nNiwan says: “If words do not communicate, they are not kin; if the work is not done, it is not round.” The Immortal Elder cites the words of sages and immortals, then elaborates: This refers to the ruler of ten thousand chariots, abiding in his ninefold chamber, issuing decrees and commands in accord with yin and yang’s rhythms. In seeking the Elixir, one must follow yin and yang’s seasons and timeliness—this is the moment when the solitary yang returns. Store your instruments and await the proper time without transgression. The hexagram and month refer to gathering the medicine when the moon appears, at *Zhen*’s arising—this is the time when the third day yields to *geng*. *Zhun* corresponds to *zi* and *shen*, the flourishing of water’s vitality; *Meng* aligns with *yin* and *xu*, the storage of fire’s power. Each of the sixty hexagrams has its appointed day. Here, two hexagrams—*Zhun* and *Meng*—are briefly presented, though their full intricacies cannot be exhaustively explored.\n\nThe Immortal Elder humbly states that he has not fully plumbed their depths, for the profound mysteries must be transmitted orally. The scriptures say: “These are not ordinary words of the world.” One hopes that those who have already attained the truth will thoroughly investigate the subtle and comprehend their meaning. This statement—“cannot be exhaustively explored”—implies that without the innate capacity of a supreme sage, how could one practice this Dao and become a true person?\n\nEstablishing principles and enacting punishments serves to prevent deceit; acting with benevolence and bestowing virtue serves to guide the heart toward joy. Those who defy these are met with misfortune, while those who follow them attain good fortune. According to the laws and calendrical reckonings, decrees must be issued with utmost sincerity, and actions must be single-minded and discreet.\n\nIn vigilant observation of the days: one year is contained within one month, one month within a single day, one day within a single hour, and one hour employs but one talisman. In scrutinizing the waxing and waning, one must discern the clarity and turbidity of the water born of *dui* metal, along with its precise proportions. Should there be even the slightest deviation—no matter how minute or seemingly insignificant—it will inevitably invite blame, adversity, and harm to the elixir furnace. Such errors lead to the misalignment of yin and yang, causing the solstices to reverse: midwinter becomes scorching summer, midsummer yields bitter frost, and the spring and autumn equinoxes lose their balance, with dawn and dusk, hours and clepsydra marks no longer corresponding. Rain and sunshine falter, omens and anomalies multiply, and all these portents of misfortune arise from a single misstep in tending the furnace, cascading into a hundred errors. All stem from the failure of the alchemical work, yet fools do not blame themselves but instead resent the elixir classics.\n\nOnly those with a steadfast and sincere heart, who reflect and repent with genuine remorse, redoubling their diligence and perseverance without retreat, may attain communion with Heaven. Divine aid will then be granted, and success in the endeavor assured. This is akin to the filial child whose sincerity moves the imperial heart: the heart is the root of spirit, and when the heart is true, the numinous naturally responds. Words are the voice of the heart—when auspicious, they resonate with nature and temperament; though uttered by oneself, their echoes reach far. Failure invites calamity, while success brings blessing. Deviation leads to strife, while fulfillment brings joy and great peace. These four outcomes—failure, success, deviation, and fulfillment—all arise from the human heart. When movement and stillness are not reckless but adhere to the plumb line, the four seasons align in harmony, the five phases balance, and the Dao of the *Yi* circulates and returns without obstruction.\n\nThe above analogies urge those who cultivate the elixir to concentrate their minds, remain vigilant against peril, and guard against negligence. For this elixir Way depends not solely on oneself but also on Heaven. If Heaven is even slightly opposed, one must move it with treasures and sincerity, never acting contrary to the Heavenly Dao. Only by aligning with the Heavenly Dao can the golden elixir be achieved.\n\nThus, the hexagram *Tongren* first wails and then laughs. The *Wings* says: \"The Way of the noble one may emerge or withdraw, may be silent or speak. When two hearts are as one, their sharpness is like a sword; their words, like a shared fragrance, are as the orchid.\" *Tongren* is the hexagram of those with a shared heart. In it, one yin line is surrounded by five yang lines. When yin is abundant and yang scarce, yang governs; when yang is abundant and yin scarce, yin governs. Thus, *Tongren* unites the solitary yin with the venerable yang. To attain the shared heart of *Tongren*, one must bind it with mutual benefit, only then can the words of *Tongren* be realized. Therefore, the noble one is discreet and accommodating, never speaking recklessly but using words as a means to an end. Given the difficulty of achieving the elixir Way, how could one not comply with reverence and caution?\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: The Union of Dark and New Moons**\n\nBetween the dark and new moons, the talismans unite, and the primordial chaos of *hongmeng* flows. The female and male follow one another, their essences moistening and nourishing, their transformations circulating without bound. The spirits of Heaven and Earth cannot fathom their measure. This process secures the body, conceals the form, and begins in the northeast, the region of *Ji* and *Dou*. Turning rightward, it revolves, sprouting buds, and in the hidden depths, images emerge, scattering radiant light above *Mao* and *Bi*. The trigram *Zhen* arises as the first sign of yang’s inception. The first nine is the hidden dragon; yang is established with three, yin with eight. After three days, *Zhen* stirs; after eight days, *Dui* moves. The second nine is the visible dragon, peaceful and luminous. The virtues of three and five coalesce, forming the body of *Qian*. The third nine, vigilant at dusk, refines the spirit talisman; its waxing and waning gradually transform until it returns to its origin. *Xun* governs its constancy, holding fast to its course. The fourth nine may leap forward or retreat, its path perilous. *Gen* governs advance and withdrawal, never exceeding its time—twenty-three days to uphold the appointed term. The fifth nine is the flying dragon in the celestial position, adorned with excellence. The sixth five is *Kun*, receiving and binding, nurturing all beings as the eternal mother. The ninth is the exalted dragon, battling virtue in the wilds. With the \"nine nines,\" it soars as the compass of the Dao.\n\nYang’s numbers complete, then begin anew, emotions and nature turning to unite in cyclical motion. The jade pivot ascends and descends, circulating above and below. The six lines are difficult to perceive, for they have no fixed position—this is the ancestral principle of the *Yi*.\n\nThis chapter compares the dark and new moons of a single month to the practice of elixir refinement, where the lines of the hexagram unite with the talisman. In a year, there are twelve dark and new moons, twelve full moons. In Heaven, the Greater Yin has twelve degrees, aligning with the Greater Yang in a double ring. On Earth, the Lesser Yin has twelve degrees, corresponding to the body’s meridians—this is the proper alignment of yin and yang. Yet the Lesser Yin, vast and obscure, cannot be measured. The sage, roaming within the Supreme Ultimate, first models the union of talismans before proceeding.\n\nThus, in the prior Heaven, the Greater Yin of Heaven each month aligns with the Greater Yang. When the sun and moon unite, the moon lies below the sun, the sun above the moon. The moon receives the sun’s pure radiance, its light directed toward Heaven, unseen by human eyes. This is akin to the union of man and woman: the man above, the woman below, the woman covered by the man and thus unseen. At the dark and new moons, the moon lies beneath the sun, its light undivided—comparable to the Lesser Yin of the human realm.\n\nAt the time of the Supreme Ultimate’s chaos, within the prior Heaven’s *hongmeng*, when the talismans unite until the third day of *geng*, the subtle yang is about to arise. The yang male and yin female follow one another, their union generating moistening essences that naturally circulate and transform. The spirits of Heaven and Earth cannot fathom their measure.\n\nThe Great Dao cannot be enacted without the capacity of a sage. The *Wings* says: \"Align your virtue with Heaven and Earth, your brightness with the sun and moon, your order with the four seasons, your fortune and misfortune with ghosts and spirits.\" The numinous wonder of the golden elixir, though beyond the measure of Heaven and Earth or the divination of spirits, arises from the sage’s skill in aligning virtue with Heaven and Earth, reversing the workings of creation to generate this *qi*. The sage aligns brightness with the sun and moon, inverting effort to enact this *qi*. The sage harmonizes order with the four seasons, employing this *qi* so that cold and heat do not constrain one another. The sage subtly aligns fortune and misfortune with ghosts and spirits, completing this *qi* so that demons and gods reveal their true forms. Thus, even Heaven and Earth cannot fathom it—only the sage can.\n\nWhat does \"securing the body and concealing the form\" mean? It refers to the Way of *Kun*. The function of *Kun* lies in its palace of earth, which governs the water of *Kan*. The virtue of water is to benefit all things without contention.\n\nThe sage, by employing it in reverse, attains the benefits of water. The utility of the *Yi* lies in its sixfold application; \"perpetual correctness\" is the virtue of *Kun*. It begins in the northeast, in the region of the Dipper and Winnowing Basket—what does this mean? Each new moon, the moon and sun necessarily meet in the region of the Winnowing Basket and Dipper. The Winnowing Basket and Dipper belong to *Gen*; *Gen* as a hexagram signifies yin encroaching upon yang. It is called the \"demon’s path,\" for each month, when the moon reaches this region, it loses its brightness. Thus it is said, \"losing one’s companions.\" This resembles the way people follow the five phases in sequence, experiencing birth, aging, illness, and death, as cold and heat alternate in succession.\n\nWhen the heavens rotate to the right, the sun, moon, and stars all turn to the right. When the moon reaches this region, it must darken and conceal itself, appearing like a jade tablet or a ritual scepter. On the first and second days, as it rotates to the right toward the *geng* direction, its essence and light begin to emerge, and its spirit is born. By the time of the Pleiades and the Hyades, the moon borrows the sun’s light, which shines forth below like the first yang of *Gan* rising beneath *Kun*, forming the image of *Zhen*. On the third evening, one yang and two yins—*Gan*’s eldest son—attains its time and enacts the Way, hence \"the third day brings *Zhen*’s movement.\"\n\nOn the eighth day, the upper *kan* appears: one yin and one yang, *Kun*’s youngest daughter, *Dui*, receives the fire of *ding* and temporarily enacts *Kun*’s Way to preside over affairs. Yin and yang harmonize, and spirits are born—thus it is said, \"on the eighth day, *Dui* acts.\" At the full moon of the fifteenth, the moon is wholly yang and radiant—thus it is said, \"on the fifteenth, virtue is perfected, and the *Gan* body is complete.\" This resembles the upper line of the hexagram, akin to the golden elixir already formed within the crucible, where water and metal of the Great Yin reflect the sun to generate essence and spirit. The human body mirrors the moon to produce the golden elixir; within the crucible, the elixir is present. One must remain vigilant as if facing peril, cautious when full, and fearful of decline when at its peak. Only the sage can maintain vigilance from beginning to end, allowing *Xun* to continue the lineage, firmly securing and carefully nurturing it. Gradually circulating the yin tally to envelop the yang *qi*, *Gen* governs advance and retreat. When the tally is full, the lower *kan* gradually congeals and solidifies. Heaven’s position is attained with joy; one draws forth lead and mercury. When lead is exhausted, mercury dries; at six-five, *Kun* receives and binds, encompassing beginning and end. Lead and mercury both transform into the golden elixir, which is now complete. Though one month is used as a metaphor for its practice, the essential work requires ten months to approximate the formation of the body. When the work is complete, three years suffice; when the merit is lofty, twelve years are needed. It depends on the practitioner’s accumulated conduct.\n\nIf a great sage were to recreate yin and yang, aligning emotion with nature and turning them to establish a separate elixir furnace, forging the Nine Cauldrons’ great elixir, it would resemble the celestial sphere being reestablished at *zi*. Comparing the twelve lines to a single month, from darkness to the new moon, the new moon reaches dawn, and the first yang stirs again in the *Fu* hexagram. Thus it is said, \"there is no fixed position, for this is the ancestral origin of the *Yi*.\"\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: The Function of Hexagram Changes**\n\nAt the new moon’s dawn, *Fu* appears: yang *qi* begins to flow, entering and exiting without hindrance. Erecting a subtle marker of firmness, the Yellow Bell’s pitch is established in *zi*, heralding the flourishing of all things. The initial stirring of yang *qi* spreads warmth and gentle nurturance, allowing the masses to return to constancy. *Lin* governs the furnace, extending its branches to open the path, rectifying the light so it gradually advances and daily grows. In *chou*, the Great Frame is established, its low and high positions forming *Tai*. Firmness and softness both prosper; yin and yang unite, the small departing and the great arriving, converging in *yin* as the time advances. Passing through *Da Zhuang*, it arrays itself at the gate of *mao*, where elm pods fall and return to their root. Punishment and virtue alternate; day and night begin to divide. In *Guai*, yin retreats as yang ascends, washing and cleansing the wings to shake off the dust of the past. In *qian*, yang reaches its zenith at midday, and *Gou* begins its sequence. Treading frost comes first; the coldest spring lies at the well’s bottom. At *wu*, the guest is the *kan* trigram, while the host is yin. One withdraws from the world, relinquishing position to gather essence, cherishing virtue while awaiting the time. Lingering in obscurity, *Pi* blocks all passage; what sprouts cannot grow. Yin extends while yang recedes, its name and form vanishing. Observing its power and measuring its weight, one entrusts the young and tender to the autumn’s harvest. The old and withered revive; shepherd’s purse and wheat sprout anew. Under cover, they grow; in *Bo*, the limbs rot and the form diminishes. When the transformative *qi* is exhausted and lost, the spirit’s path is cut off, and it returns to *Kun*’s origin. Abiding in earth’s principle, it bears Heaven’s mandate, spreading and proclaiming the profound and distant, connecting what is remote and obstructed. Responding to the measure, it nurtures the seeds of yin and yang’s origin. Vast and indistinct, none know its beginning. Those who lose the track first become lost; later, they become the master. Without levelness, there is no slope—this is the Way’s natural transformation. Flourishing and decline alternate, mutually dependent. In the end, *Kun* returns to *Fu*, like a linked ring. Emperors and kings inherit and govern for a thousand generations, ever enduring.\n\nThe previous chapter described the waxing and waning of a single month as the image of refining the elixir to completion. This chapter compares the work of the twelve months to the image of its practice. The initial attainment of the elixir corresponds to the *Fu* hexagram—*Fu* being one yang hidden beneath five yins.\n\nSages and worthies who practice this Way ascend beyond the ordinary to become sages; wicked people who practice it lose their lives and forfeit their bodies. King Wen said, \"Companions arrive without blame; the Way returns after seven days—it is beneficial to have somewhere to go.\" \"Companions arrive\" means companions come from afar. \"Without blame\" means there is benefit without harm. \"The Way returns after seven days\" refers to the practice of the *Yi*’s Way—enacting it in reverse. \"Seven days to return\" means the moon conceals its light for seven days before shining again, just as in humans. After seven days of movement, yang begins to stir. \"Beneficial to have somewhere to go\" means advancing virtuously without loss. The *Eastern Capital Rhapsody* says, \"The sun and moon are concealed at the Dragon’s Tail\" (the Tail being the star at the end of the Dipper). This refers to yang’s imminent return. Confucius said, \"In *Fu*, one sees the heart of Heaven and Earth.\" The world does not know the heart of Heaven and Earth; Laozi called it the \"gate of the Mysterious Female,\" while Master Fang referred to it as the \"gate of life and door of death.\" The *Yi* says, \"Thunder lies within the earth—*Fu*. The former kings, on this day, closed the passes; merchants and travelers did not journey, and lords did not inspect their domains.\" Thunder is firm yang; earth is soft yin. With firm yang within soft yin, one revives the *qi* of prior Heaven. The former kings practiced this Way on this day, closing the passes and not inspecting their domains to focus their minds and devote themselves wholeheartedly. Merchants and travelers represent miscellaneous distractions; not journeying means cutting off such distractions to practice the Way single-mindedly. Thus the *Xiang* commentary says, \"Returning without having gone far is for cultivating the body,\" and \"The one in the middle alone returns to follow the Way.\"\n\nAt the new moon’s dawn, *Fu* appears: yang *qi* begins to flow. The sage’s heart is one. *Fu* means first concealing and then returning. The initial yang *qi* enters and exits freely, without harm. \"Erecting a subtle marker of firmness\" means *Gan* moves directly. The Yellow Bell’s pitch in the yang month of *zi* heralds the masses—the beginning of all things. The initial stirring of yang *qi* first spreads and flourishes, bestowing gentle warmth upon the masses, allowing them to return to constancy. Master Shangyang said, \"The marvel of making the elixir lies precisely here—never treat it lightly.\"\n\nHaving received the master’s instructions in the Dao, one must understand the Three Passes and Three Phases. Why is this so?\n\nFirst, prepare the altar and platform, then gather the medicinal ingredients. Once obtained, the ingredients circulate freely—entering and exiting, refining and cultivating. The gentle warmth spreads, bestowing subtle warmth that penetrates directly. This is the First Pass and First Phase.\n\nApproaching the alchemical furnace, apply the firing times with focused intent. The Pass opens, the path unobstructed—neither excessive nor reckless. Colors harmonize, radiance softens, growing ever lower and humbler. The *Dayu* pitch responds to the *chou* day, and the light gradually lengthens. This is the Middle Pass and Second Phase.\n\nThe *Taicu* pitch arrives, ascending to form *Tai*. *Tai* as a hexagram is earth above heaven: yin, though above, can moisten below; yang, though below, can illuminate above. Thus the *Xici* commentary says, \"The soft above and the firm below—these two *qi* interact and unite, halting yet rejoicing. The male descends, the female ascends, hence it is beneficial for divination.\" When the Five Phases are inverted, heaven and earth produce treasure. The soft acts first, enriching the other to become host; the firm acts later, and I become the guest. The male begins with a small departure, the female with a great arrival. Metal and *qi* depend on each other; yang completes the *Gan* body. Here, firmness and softness flourish together, yin and yang unite. This is the Lower Pass and Third Phase.\n\nGradually advancing through *Dazhuang*, the returning elixir coagulates. Passing through the *mao* gate, the elm pods return to their root. Punishment and virtue bear each other, day and night begin to divide. The signs of the elixir appear in the Yellow Court—guard and nurture it with care and single-mindedness. *Guai* as a hexagram is yin severing and parting; yang *qi* has already returned. The golden elixir is conceived, *Gan* robust and flourishing, metal *qi* pure yang. At the end of *si*, the movement of yin talismans begins. *Gou* receives and suddenly embraces yang, preventing its escape. Yang regains yin, and yin becomes the host. *Kun* as a hexagram: \"The first six, treading frost, the well’s bottom cold spring—yin *qi* descends.\" The sixth month gathers essence, awaiting the hour. *Pi* arrives in the seventh month: yin and yang do not communicate, yin extends while yang withdraws, yang *qi* inwardly bright. The eighth month observes the image, measures and examines autumn’s nature, nurturing the young and tender like wheat sprouts. The old withers, then revives like shepherd’s purse. Once the transformation’s *qi* is exhausted, the form dissolves. When the Dao is exhausted, it returns to *Kun*’s origin—coming and going, eternally compliant, bearing heaven.\n\nThis text is composed with profound method: some sections begin with an introduction, others conclude with a summary. Those without an introduction are summarized at the end; those without a conclusion begin with an introduction. This chapter, for instance, lacks an introduction and is thus summarized at the close. Its opening lines state: \"At the new moon’s dawn, *Fu*; *Fu* then *Lin*; *Lin* then *Tai*; *Tai* then *Dazhuang*; *Dazhuang* then *Guai*; *Guai* then *Gan*; *Gan* then *Gou*; *Gou* then *Dun*; *Dun* then *Pi*; *Pi* then *Guan*; *Guan* then *Bo*; *Bo* then *Kun*.\" The conclusion states: \"Profound, distant, subtle, and remote—separated yet connected.\" These two lines are most concise. \"Profound, distant, subtle, and remote\" refer to the two substances of yin and yang—so profound they cannot be grasped, so distant they cannot be conceived. Yet their transformative power is double that of heaven and earth. \"Separated yet connected\" means the two substances are divided by nearly ten thousand *li*, yet if the Yellow Matchmaker mediates, even the most distant becomes near.\n\nThus, when the two substances respond to measure and nurture the seed, they become the origin of yin and yang. The sage employs them to practice the Dao. Vast and indistinct, beyond grasp—yet the sage reverses their function to apply them.\n\n\"First lost, then found; later becoming the sovereign.\" The soft, compliant, beneficial, and steadfast—this is the path the noble person follows. \"First lost, then found; later attaining constancy.\" These are the words of the Ten Wings.\n\nThe Immortal Elder elaborates: \"Yin becomes the host at the end,\" and \"later becomes the sovereign\"—both refer to *Kun*’s beneficial earthly Dao.\n\n\"No level ground without slope\"—this is the Dao’s nature. Water, utterly level, pools into a deep abyss. The sloping banks do not flow; if the slope is filled, water naturally overflows. This analogy illustrates the Dao’s natural principle: change and renewal grow ever more abundant, returning to *Gan* and ceasing, then resuming with *Kun*. Thus it is said: \"Ending with *Kun*, beginning anew,\" like tracing a linked ring.\n\nEmperors and kings who govern for a thousand years endure. If they can govern by the Dao of *Qian* and *Kun*, reversing and complying, then a thousand-year lifespan is not excessive. If their merit is lofty and conduct illustrious, ascending to heaven in broad daylight is within their allotted portion. In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor first served the people, cultivating worldly blessings. In his next life, he became a minister, then an immortal, transcending the world. In his third life, he became a sovereign, then relinquished the realm, abandoning all affairs. Seeking a secluded place among mountains and waters, he found the Lord of Dinghu at Jun Mountain, where he refined the Ninefold Returning Elixir. After its completion, he ascended in broad daylight, riding a dragon.\n\nNote: Jun Mountain is Dongting Lake, where a mountain stands within the lake. Because the Yellow Emperor refined the elixir there, it is called Jun Mountain.\n\n**Chapter Twenty: Nurturing Nature to Establish Destiny**\n\nTo nurture nature and extend life, first consider the end, then deliberate on the beginning. The body one inherits is originally unified, without primordial essence. *Qi* spreads, relying on yin and yang for measure. The hun and po reside within: the yang spirit is the sun-hun, the yin spirit the moon-po. Hun and po serve as each other’s dwelling. Nature governs within, establishing boundaries; emotions operate without, constructing walls and outer defenses. When defenses are complete, people and things are at peace. At this time, emotions harmonize with *Qian* and *Kun*: *Gan* moves directly, *qi* spreads and flows; *Kun* is still, converging into the Dao. Firmness retreats, softness transforms and nourishes. Nine returns, seven reversions, eight reunions, six residences—male white, female red. Metal and fire restrain each other, then water settles and fire. The Five Phases begin with the highest good, like water—clear and flawless. The Dao’s form is the true One, difficult to depict. Changing and dispersing, each dwells alone, like a chicken’s egg: white and black aligned, a *cun* in length, the beginning of all. The four limbs, five viscera, sinews, and bones all develop, completing ten months before emerging from the womb—bones soft and pliable, flesh smooth as lead.\n\nThis chapter speaks of nurturing nature before cultivating destiny. What, then, is nature? It is *Gan*’s substance. If one can nurture it, *Gan*’s yang will not wane; essence guards within, *qi* arises without. With this, one can refine the elixir and enter sagehood. Yet people do not know that nature and destiny are one. What is this \"one\"? Some guess nature is spiritual clarity, or a lump of flesh, a stubborn heart. Others take thoughts and perceptions as nature, or the intangible, or empty nothingness. Some mistake orders for destiny. How could they know the dim and distant is destiny, or the gate of ceaseless generation and transformation? Only blind guesses and dreams—how can they reach the sage’s Dao?\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: \"Heaven is nature to humanity.\"\n\nThe human heart is a mechanism—when a noble person obtains it, they cultivate themselves; when a petty person obtains it, they treat life lightly. Confucius said: \"Exhaust principle, fulfill nature, to reach destiny.\" Mencius said: \"Preserve the heart, nurture nature, to await Heaven’s mandate.\" Whether one dies young or lives long, remain unwavering; cultivate the self to await it—this is how destiny is established. The Dao of the sages reaches its utmost in Mencius, yet his clarity is too severe. Yi [Wing] said: \"Of old, when the sages composed the *Yijing*, they did so to accord with the principle of nature and destiny.\" Thus they established Heaven’s Dao as yin and yang, Earth’s Dao as soft and hard, and humanity’s Dao as benevolence and righteousness.\n\nThe immortals above say: \"If one cultivates nature but not destiny, how can they enter sagehood? Cultivate destiny only after cultivating nature—this is the path of practice.\" Some say the Buddhists cultivate nature while the Daoists cultivate destiny—how could there be two Ways in the world? This is none other than Mencius’ Dao of preserving the heart, nurturing nature, cultivating the self, and establishing destiny. To establish destiny, one must first nurture nature; without awakening to nature, how can one know destiny? Thus the *Zhongyong* says: \"What Heaven commands is called nature; following nature is called the Dao.\" Therefore, the sage has no dual heart.\n\nThis is to say: if one wishes to nurture nature and prolong life, one must first make the world understand what it means to nurture nature. Dongbin thus used elixir refinement to illustrate it, yet they did not know what it means to establish destiny. Zhang and Xu thus used elixir refinement as a metaphor. \"Only essence, only unity—hold fast to the center\": this is nurturing nature. \"When male and female unite in essence, the myriad things transform and generate\": this is establishing destiny. \"Accumulating essence, amassing *qi*\": this is nurturing nature. \"Flowing *wu* to join *si*\": this is establishing destiny.\n\nThose who reflect on beginnings and ends—people rely on their cleverness, clinging to bias without turning back, saying: \"Since there is birth, there must be death—how could there be longevity?\" Yet sages, immortals, and buddhas are all born of Heaven—how could a teacher grant it to others? How could they achieve this without reflection? Those who willingly accept death should first consider: consider, that is, reflect. Reflect on where this body comes from. If one says it is born of the *qi* of parents’ yin and yang, then the *qi* of yin and yang must be able to prolong life and must be able to perfect one as a buddha or immortal. Thus refining the great elixir is no different from the moment of receiving *qi* at birth—only the direction differs.\n\nConfucius said: \"Not knowing life, how can one know death?\" The sages clarify the causes of life and death in nature and destiny, demonstrating the Dao of yin and yang—why the difference between reversal and compliance. That which complies to generate beings is humanity; that which reverses to generate the elixir is sagehood. This is called: \"Original essence spreads like clouds, relying on *qi* at the beginning.\" What is meant by yin and yang as measure? The dwelling of hun and po. Yin and yang take hun and po as their substance; hun and po rely on yin and yang as their vessel. When separated, *li* is the sun’s hun, *kan* is the moon’s po. The yang within yin is *wu* earth, which governs the hun; the yin within yang is *si* earth, which governs the po. Hun and po mutually serve as chambers; yin and yang interflow.\n\nNature governs the solid essence within, establishing the firm barrier; emotion governs the subdued *qi* without, building the outer wall. What is the wall? The encasing of the *Chenghua*. What is the outer wall?\n\nThe chamber for refining the elixir—at this moment, the nature of *qian* moves and straightens, causing essence and *qi* to unite as one body; the emotion of *kun* quiets and closes, becoming the vessel of the Dao. The firm and straight, once applied, then retreat; the soft and yielding spread moisture to nourish the elixir, born within the crucible, returning to accomplish the work.\n\nWhat is called the \"Nine Returns\": earth’s four generates metal, heaven’s nine completes silver. Dragon and tiger intertwine, the *qi* of metal and silver returns once more to the crucible—thus it is called the Nine Returns. The \"Seven Reversions\": earth’s two generates fire, heaven’s seven completes cinnabar. Hun and po yearn for each other, the essence of cinnabar and fire reflects back into the crucible—thus it is called the Seven Reversions. The \"Eight Returns\": heaven’s three generates wood, earth’s eight completes mercury. The true of *wu* and *si* unites, wood’s essence returns to the refining crucible—thus it is called the Eight Returns. The \"Six Residings\": heaven’s one generates water, earth’s six completes lead. Emotion and nature resonate, the wonder of lead and mercury revolves and resides within the crucible—thus it is called the Six Residings.\n\nThe male is white, the female is red: metal and fire constrain each other. The male belongs to the Azure Dragon’s wood, receiving the *qi* of *dui* metal, refined to return as white; the female belongs to the White Tiger’s metal, imbued with the essence of *li* fire, refined to return as red.\n\nThen, the settling of water and the regulation of fire: the altar must be pure and solemn, the medicinal substances authentic and correct. One must measure the quantity of water to adjust the firing, gauge the maturity of the fire to refine it. At this time, it is the inception of the Five Phases’ transformation.\n\nThe highest good is like water: within water lies metal, able to generate *Lishui*. Seek its utmost clarity, entirely without disturbance, without substance, without flaw—only then can it transform. This is called the Way of the highest good.\n\nIn form, there are male and female—these are the forms of the Dao. *Qian* and *kun* are the images of the Dao. Within form and image, the true *qi* of the One is born, yet it cannot be depicted in shape or drawn in image.\n\nThus, this form and this image each follow their transformative mechanisms, dispersing and residing according to their natures, wielding life and wielding death. *Jia* and *yi* roam from the east, *geng* and *xin* converge from the west—thus it is said, each dwells in solitude.\n\nLike a chicken’s egg: the Returned Elixir has form.\n\nThe black and white in alignment signify the union of yin and yang. A span of one *cun* in length marks the initial formation of the Elixir, as minute as a grain of millet. Gradually, this span expands, not merely filling the Spirit Chamber but suffusing warmth throughout the four limbs, moistening the five viscera, and invigorating sinews and bones—all become harmoniously smooth. After ten months of work, the Elixir takes form, shedding its fetal husk, and is called the Yang Spirit. The image of the Yang Spirit is the *qi* of primordial origin, congealed into bone—pliable as if rolled, its flesh smooth as lead powder, unlike the *qi* and blood of later heaven that form human beings, whose bones are heavy and flesh turbid, incapable of transformation. The flesh is smooth as lead, and lead is akin to powder, also called \"lead powder\" (commonly known as water powder, white, soft, and smooth, used by women to adorn their faces, enhancing their radiance). How much more so, then, is this Yang Spirit the true lead *qi* of primordial origin, coagulated into form?\n\nThis corresponds to the nurturing described in Chapter Six. In Chapter Twenty-One, \"The Mutual Transformation of the Two Qi,\" the yang burning-mirror does not generate light without the sun, nor can the fangzhu vessel yield water without the stars and moon. If even distant and subtle *qi* can resonate and transform, how much more so the intimate proximity of true yin and true yang within the heart and chest? Yin and yang pair as the sun and moon, water and fire manifest their effects.\n\nThe yang burning-mirror is a yang object, containing *qi* within, thus it can evoke fire from the sun. The fangzhu is a yin object, containing essence within, thus it can evoke water from the moon. Though the sun and moon hang high in the heavens and the burning-mirror and fangzhu are exceedingly subtle, the two *qi* of yin and yang still mutually transform. How much more so within the human body, where true yin and true yang reside intimately in the heart and chest, near and easily sought—how could they fail to resonate and transform? The fault lies with later people who have not grasped the Way.\n\nThe yin and yang of the human body may be likened to the sun and moon in the sky, and the water and fire of various mirrors may be compared to the essence and *qi* within the body. Even inanimate objects resonate thus; how much more so beings with consciousness and spirit naturally interact? Among all things between heaven and earth, humans are the most numinous. Even the basest and most foolish know the principle of yin and yang’s transformative nurturing without needing instruction to act accordingly. Yet all the foolish and deluded only know the forward course that generates beings; as for the reverse application—this is the path of refining essence and subduing *qi* to form the Elixir, which no teacher imparts. This chapter simply elucidates how the two *qi* of yin and yang resonate and transform to accomplish creation.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: The Three Treasures as the Key**\nClose the three treasures of ear, eye, and mouth; no leakage may occur. The Perfected One lurks in the deep abyss, floating and roaming, guarding the compass’s center. Twisting and turning to see and hear, opening and closing in perfect accord, these become the pivot of the self. In movement and stillness, never exhausted, the *qi* within the *li* and *kan* nurtures and protects. The *kan* does not employ hearing, the *dui* does not engage in speech—few words follow the vast primordial chaos. Once the three are sealed, relax the body in an empty chamber, commit the will to emptiness, and take non-thought as the constant. Though difficult to verify and shift, the heart remains focused, never straying. In sleep, the spirit embraces; upon waking, it awaits presence or absence. The complexion gradually becomes moist, the bones and joints grow ever stronger. Dispel all yin demons, then establish the true yang and cultivate it without cease. May the *qi* of clouds and rain flow abundantly like spring’s gentle rain, the fluids flow like melting ice, descending from the head to the feet, then ascending again, circulating through the boundless cavern, suffusing the entire being. The returning is the verification of the Dao; weakness is the socket of virtue. Plow and sow the fields of former faults, cleanse the filth of the minute—once regulated, the turbid becomes the path to clarity, and long darkness turns to luminous brightness.\n\nThis chapter meticulously details the secret methods of entering the chamber to refine the Elixir. Once a student receives the oral instructions of a teacher, they must recite this chapter ten thousand times, savoring each sentence and pondering every word. Do not read it carelessly, for even a single character misplaced will prevent the Elixir’s formation. This chapter is the crucial point where the tally matches the contract, containing truths that cannot be divulged in words—what heaven treasures.\n\nMoreover, though human nature at birth is without ungoodness, as one grows older, few among those not endowed with sagely potential remain steadfast. Most are led astray by dissolute friends and external temptations, or bewildered by the allure of sensual pleasures and desires. At the gates of the six senses—sight, sound, and speech—every object of affection becomes a daily and nightly act of harm, each a most bitter poison. The ear, eye, and mouth...\n\nHear with the ear, see with the eye, crave with the mouth—flavors. For this reason, fortune is ruined by form, harm arrives with sound, illness enters through the mouth, dreams arise, and drunkenness leads to death. Endlessly, how can one escape? Most scholars fail to attain the Dao because these three—ear, eye, and mouth—like neighboring friends, lure one another, drowning and losing their true nature. The immortal elders regard ear, eye, and mouth as the \"Three Treasures,\" revering them and never daring to indulge lightly. Thus, they seal them tightly, preventing their activation. Only when entering the chamber does their great function manifest; only when the six roots are profoundly settled can one gather and refine the true person—who is none other than the earth of *si* (巳).\n\nThose who plunge into the deep abyss use the earth of *si* to restrain water and seek the Elixir. Those who float and guard the compass’s center—this center is called the \"Cavern of Creation.\" When refining the Great Elixir, in the instant of this talisman, one must be most cautious and secretive. The floater remains ever still yet ever responsive, never straying from this function. The guardian works diligently, inwardly illuminating, for there is indeed something to await. These two lines again serve as the crucial point where the tally matches the contract, akin to wielding a great axe in labor. Thus, the true immortals and sagely masters utter mysterious words and dharma teachings that no one across ten thousand generations can fathom. Master Shangyang revealed them fully, wishing that all might understand and practice this Dao.\n\n\"Turning and curving to see and hear\" is not a dull, closed-off blockage. Inwardly, one must turn and curve, subtly and carefully, in seeing and hearing, so that the opening and closing of the earth of *wu* (戊) is neither excessive nor deceptive, harmonizing with the earth of *si* as if swallowing or guarding. The nature of *si* is reckless and wild; only the earth of *wu* can serve as its pivot and control. This is called \"the pivot and control of *si*.\" What is meant by \"inexhaustible in movement and stillness\"? The Dao of *si* is direct in movement and focused in stillness. If skillfully employed, it will not lead to exhaustion.\n\nWhen *li* (離) qi is inwardly nourished and defended, the eye’s light turns inward. For *kan* (坎), one does not rely on acute hearing but must listen inwardly. For *dui* (兌), one does not engage in idle talk but harmonizes the breath to follow the transformations of primordial chaos. Only when these three are skillfully managed at their crucial points can one relax the body in an empty chamber. \"Relaxing the body\" means to be at ease without strain; \"empty chamber\" means to be pure and undefiled. Entrusting one’s will to emptiness and non-being—for emptiness and non-being are the birthplace of the primordial unity of qi. This is called \"the primordial qi that comes from emptiness and non-being.\" To obtain this qi, one must bend and submit one’s thoughts to seek it.\n\n\"Non-thought\" is most useful. The true person plunges into the deep abyss, responding with non-thought. The floater guards the compass’s center, awaiting with non-thought. Breathing intermingles and nurtures, achieved through non-thought. The three natures unite, entering through non-thought. To respond, await, achieve, and enter—these functions rely on abundance, thus making it a constant practice.\n\nThe earth of *wu* is called the White Tiger, whose nature is changeable, restless, and difficult to stabilize. If restrained by the earth of *si*, one must never allow it to run rampant or shift carelessly. Should the mind lack focus, disasters may arise. Earlier, it was said \"non-thought\"; now, it is said \"the mind must be focused and not run rampant.\" Can one not ponder this deeply?\n\nIn sleep, spirit and qi embrace when the mind does not run rampant and thoughts do not shift. At this moment of sleep, spirit and qi naturally unite. Yet one must remain ever awake and ever aware, observing the presence or absence of this qi. Only at this stage of refining the Elixir does one begin to perceive its verification. In the past, when I received my master’s instructions, this segment seemed most difficult. Recently, while practicing this great work on the northern slope of Mount Daluo, I found it surprisingly easy.\n\nThe essential point is to cultivate without ceasing; only then can the full merit be accomplished. Thus, when the immortal elders clearly gather, refine, and burn, not the slightest error can be tolerated. From the subtle moistening of complexion downward, every sentence must be applied precisely, with none left idle. Only after obtaining the Elixir will its natural effects manifest in various signs. Those who practice this Dao in the filthy, corrupt world, cultivating the Dharma beyond the world, if they persevere without interruption, will surely succeed in their merit. Do not abandon the path midway due to minor demonic obstacles. This is called \"the path from turbidity to clarity; prolonged darkness will surely brighten.\" Attaining sagehood and immortality can be expected any day. The merit is most spiritually swift, hence it is named the \"Divine Elixir.\" Those who follow side paths gain no merit. **Chapter Twenty-Three: Side Paths Yield No Merit**\n\nPeople of the world favor petty arts, failing to discern the depth of the Dao. They abandon the correct path to follow deviant shortcuts, seeking quick results that lead to blockage. Like the blind without a staff or the deaf listening to music, they fish for pheasants and hares in water or search for fish and dragons on mountains. They plant wheat hoping for millet, or wield compasses to seek squares, exhausting their strength and spirit year after year without success. To know the method of \"subduing and ingesting,\" the matter is simple and not complex.\n\nPeople of the world favor petty arts, but petty arts are not the vessel of the Dao. Their scope is shallow and narrow, unfit to hear the great Dao. The Dao is vast, encompassing heaven and earth; it is deep and boundless as the sea. Yet people, by nature, cannot comprehend it. First poisoned by blind teachers, their initial words become dominant, and the true Dao has no chance to be heard. Those who prefer side paths, practicing \"dual cultivation\" or abandoning the correct path to follow deviant ones, ingest medicines seeking lightness and ascension. Their haste leads to blockage; their essence is exhausted, and their nature is not nurtured. Like the blind without a staff, borrowing the Dao to engage in debates, they are as deaf listening to music. Why not observe the tally and the five phases without inversion? Searching for fish and dragons on mountains, sitting in dry meditation to seek immortality, planting wheat hoping for millet—if one acts thus to attain the Dao, wielding compasses to seek squares, all such efforts exhaust strength and spirit. Without encountering a sagely master, one labors year after year without success. To know the method of \"subduing and ingesting,\" the ancient immortals’ words are not complex: \"Subdue qi without ingesting qi; ingest qi only after subduing qi. Ingesting qi does not lead to longevity; longevity comes from subduing qi.\" These words are the true and wondrous secret, guiding those of the highest rank.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four: Flowing Pearl and Golden Flower**\n\nThe flowing pearl of the Great Yang ever seeks to depart; when one suddenly obtains the Golden Flower, it turns and intermingles, transforming into a white liquid that congeals into hardness. The Golden Flower first sings, and in a moment, dissolves into water. The horse’s teeth are coral and carnelian; the Yang then proceeds to harmonize. Nature and emotions naturally press and urge. When Yin constrains and stores, it is the compassionate mother nurturing the filial son to repay kindness; the stern father issues commands to instruct descendants. The five phases intermingle, jade-like, relying on one another to generate fire. Fire’s nature melts metal; metal chops wood. The three, five, and one unite with heaven and earth. Their utmost essence can be transmitted orally but not written down.\n\nYou must turn right at *wu* and rotate east at *mao*. The boundary between *mao* and *you* separates host and guest. The dragon calls to the tiger; the tiger inhales the dragon’s essence. Both drink and consume, each coveting the other, then mutually swallowing and chewing, devouring one another. When Mars guards the west and Venus traverses the sky, the killing qi arrives—what cannot be overthrown? When the fox and dog guard the rat, and birds fear the goshawk, each fulfills its function—how dare they make a sound? Without grasping the principle, one should not speak recklessly. Exhausting family wealth, leaving wife and children hungry and poor—from ancient times to now, countless have pursued this, yet few succeed. Rare are those who meet and achieve it. Seeking famous medicines widely only leads the Dao astray.\n\nThis chapter clearly points to the *flowing pearl* and *golden flower* as the two entities of yin and yang, further revealing the secret precautions in the firing and refinement—so detailed and precise that it can only be transmitted orally, not committed to writing. Master Shangyang thus reaffirmed this principle in verse:\n\nThe *Great Yang*’s flowing pearl departs, bearing the sun’s crow;\nFrom the *Li* palace, the *naga*-maiden—neither form nor pearl.\nThe *Great Yang*’s radiance truly claims the title of *Dry Father*;\nWithin cinnabar lies mercury, and mercury is the ancestor of cinnabar.\n\nOrdinary people, led astray by the six thieves, forcefully carve and bore, causing the flowing pearl to either drip (like the dragon’s spittle) or escape. When gold resides in *Dui* and *Kan* generates the flower, the true water of *Kan* can then restrain the cinnabar of *Li*. Perpetually subdued by metal and water, it transforms into a white liquid. At the proper time, refining returns gold to its former state, and the flower first emits the *True Earth*. At *si-si*, the spirit must flourish; at *si-day*, the earth spirit surges. A jade vessel ascends to the high seat, exposing both feet. The golden flower transmutes into water, and in a brief moment, its color resembles horse-tooth stalactite, *gan-gan* jade, or dry yang as a guest seeking a companion. Yang’s nature and yin’s disposition delight in warmth, intertwining and entangling. Yin is pressed by yang; yin is urged by yang. They spur one another, restraining and constraining. Between the two kidneys lies the *Forbidden Gate*. One yin, one yang; one *Qian*, one *Kun*. The compassionate mother says: “Metal gives birth to *Kan* water, and water is the *Metal Duke*—water is called the filial son.” The stern father says: “Wood gives birth to cinnabar-mercury, and mercury begets the grandson.” If the grandson’s thoughts are not single-minded and strict, issuing commands, the five phases will err and invert, with mutual conquests and responses. Lead, mercury, cinnabar, and silver rely on earth. When fire flourishes, earth is born; earth is the mother of metal. When fire prevails, it melts metal; wood fears metal’s punishment. Metal is felled by fire, and wood thus flourishes. In the southeast, five woods and three fires; in the northwest, five waters and one metal; four in the center. *Wu-si* is called the number of the Three and Five, extending from one to ten thousand, through *jing* and *gai*, completing the tally to match heaven and earth. Mutual resonance stirs the utmost essence—this resonance and that union. The oral transmission must be clear: you should rotate right, then east. Whether halting or swift, yang metal is born at *zi-wu*, then revolves east; yin mercury is born at *wu*, enclosing and securing yang’s essence. At *mao* and *you*, host and guest—though gold’s origin lies between them, separated by ten thousand *li*—embrace benevolence and virtue. Gold delights in wood’s compliance. The dragon calls, the tiger inhales; gold cherishes wood’s benevolence. One host, one guest, drinking and consuming in kinship. One crow, one hare, both coveting; one man, one woman, then swallowing and chewing; one *kui*, one snake, devouring one another. The southern spirit, the Vermilion Bird, with Mars guarding and occupying the west, forges and refines metal’s virtue. The killing force of *Dui* demands utmost caution—lest the slightest error occur. Containing and storing the vital intent is called *Venus* traversing the ecliptic, faithfully returning to the *Dry Corpse*’s baleful *qi*. Once it arrives, life is extinguished and spread, like a cat seizing a rat or a bird fearing the goshawk—each fulfills its function. How dare they make a sound? Without the oral transmission, how can one guess or speak? To squander family wealth, pursuing heterodox paths, deviant tracks, *cai-zhan* misguidance, and delusion—such grave transgressions bring ruin upon others and oneself. From ancient times to now, countless have pursued this, yet few meet a true teacher. Rare are those who succeed. Without understanding yin and yang, how can one know their union? Seeking famous medicines far and wide only depletes true *qi*. Minerals, plants, and trees—devoid of *qi*—are distant from the Dao, separated by ten thousand *li*. The method’s outline is expounded here to clarify the profound canon for later learners, enabling them to become immortals.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: If Truly Encountered**\n\nIf truly encountered and the thread is glimpsed, use *qi* to compare and measure things from beginning to end. The five phases mutually conquer, alternating as father and mother. The mother contains nourishing fluids; the father governs bestowal and congealing essence, shaping form. Like metal and stone, it does not decay. If one examines and focuses without leakage, one can achieve the Dao—like raising a hundred-foot pole to see its shadow, or calling into a thousand-peak valley to hear its echo. How can it not be efficacious? The supreme image of heaven and earth is such that if one swallows a mere inch of *yege* or a *ba-dou* seed, one will collapse, unable to bend or straighten. At such a time, even if King Wen cast yarrow stalks, Confucius interpreted omens, Bian Que wielded needles, or Wu Xian beat drums, none could revive or rouse the fallen.\n\nThis chapter means: if one meets a teacher, one must first carefully observe and discern the thread—whether it is orthodox or heterodox. Compare it with the *Cantong Qi*; if it is a true teacher, nothing will be unknown, and no question will remain unanswered. If it is a blind teacher, nine out of ten things will be misunderstood, fabricating strange tales to lure people into the weeds. Some claim silence is the Dao; others insist only sitting in meditation and contemplating emptiness. Ask them about cinnabar, mercury, tiger, dragon, metal, wood, the separation of *mao* and *you*, the *Zhen* trigram’s three-day image, or the reverse use of the primordial—yet they cannot answer, left mute by the alchemical classics. Foolish worldly people, hearing that so-and-so has sat in meditation for years or entered the marketplace a few times, immediately declare them enlightened. How would they know Master Ma’s rebuke of Nanyue for grinding bricks? How would they understand the principle of yin and yang swallowing and restraining, the dynamics of generation and destruction?\n\nThere are also vulgar sorts who parrot others’ dregs, speaking only of Chan’s sharp debate, calling it the *Nature School* and claiming it as the Dao to deceive the world—how lamentable! What do they know of Chan and nature?\n\nWhat is *nature*? It is *Qian*’s function, the Nine in use—its movement is direct. If one can comprehend this, it is the *True Dharma Eye Treasury*.\n\nWhat is *Chan*? It is *Kun*’s function, the Six in use—its movement is expansive. If one knows this, it is the *Nirvana Wondrous Mind*.\n\nChan and nature unite through earth restraining lead; metal and wood merge through lead subduing mercury. Benevolence and righteousness are applied to nurture *qi* directly. Thus, one yin and one yang are the Dao of the *Yi*. Cultivating concentration in the *Li* palace is the root of Chan; seeking the mysterious in the water palace is the abode of the elixir. Though the names divide into three teachings, they are ultimately one. Observing the threads of the three teachings’ cultivation, all require the union of *qi* to succeed—this is what is meant by “using *qi* to compare.”\n\nWhat is “measuring things from beginning to end”? It means assessing the generation of humans and things, the yin and yang of their beginnings and ends, the causes of their waxing and waning. Thus, the five phases mutually generate and conquer, alternating between prosperity and decline, cycle after cycle, becoming father and mother. The Dao practiced by the supreme sages and perfected ones is the *si* of yin and yang—its essence contains and stores nourishing *qi*, as *Kun* and *Dui* alternate to become the *Holy Mother*. Its wonder governs bestowal and generation, as *Qian* and *Zhen* alternate to become the *Numinous Father*. *Qi* and fluids congeal essence, flowing to form shape, coalescing into the elixir—firm as metal and stone, imperishable. If one examines and focuses without leakage, one can achieve the Dao—like raising a pole to see its shadow, or calling into a valley to hear its echo. The natural resonance of yin and yang is most efficacious, harmonizing with the supreme image of heaven and earth’s creation.\n\nThe heartless plants and trees—wild aconite and croton—can still kill a man. How much more so the *qi* of true yin and true yang, both sentient beings, when matched in harmony? How could they fail to congeal the numinous elixir?\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Maiden of the Yellow Sprout**\nThe Maiden of the River is numinous and most wondrous. When she meets fire, she takes flight, vanishing like dust and ash. The hidden dragon conceals itself, its whereabouts unknown. To restrain her, the Yellow Sprout serves as the root. All things possess yin and yang; to defy heaven and turn one’s back on the primordial is like a hen hatching her own chicks—imperfect. Why? Because the union is not yet complete, the Three and Five unjoined, hardness and softness sundered. The essence of transformation—heaven and earth’s natural fire rises upward, water flows downward—requires no master to guide it so. The origin is governed by rectitude; once set, it cannot be altered.\n\nObserve the moment when male and female unite: hardness and softness bind inseparably, attaining their proper rhythm without need for craft or control. The male is born prone, the female curled—this is the way of the womb, the reception of *qi* at life’s inception. It is not merely seen at birth but mirrored in death, for no parent teaches this; it is fixed at the moment of union, predetermined from the start.\n\nThe River Lord’s love is a metaphor for the sea of desire. The Maiden is none other than the essence of one’s own yin mercury. Why is she called numinous and most wondrous? Because she can give life, take life, or merge into the elixir. When still and unmoving, the solitary spirit is inwardly nurtured. Yet the instant it stirs and connects, it rushes forth like a divine realm in motion. Passion arises, fortune follows form, and intent falters. The moment a thought arises, mercury flees with the fire, scattering like dust and ash, irretrievable. The dragon of essence hides its form; clouds disperse, the sky empties—emptiness is itself form. This aligns with the twenty-fourth chapter’s *Taiyang* flowing pearl, ever desiring to depart. People heedlessly watch it pass, so it returns here, drawn out and extended. The sage’s merit surpasses later generations—so it is.\n\nTo restrain her, the Yellow Sprout serves as the root, just as the sudden attainment of golden blossoms turns and interrelates, sharing the same principle. For the Maiden, compliance leads to easy loss; without the Yellow Sprout’s solitary yang, she cannot be subdued. The Yellow Sprout is the *qi* of the primordial, called the True One’s lead. When this lead *qi* is refined as the foundation, mercury will not flee. Why? Because yin and yang are paired to make it so.\n\nAll things devoid of yin and yang defy the creative power of heaven and turn their backs on the origin of life. Those who refine the elixir do not depart from yin and yang to establish their foundation. Yet once the True One’s *qi* returns and the elixir ripens, one leaps beyond yin and yang. Foolish worldly people, unversed in the elixir scriptures, claim that cultivators must dwell in deep mountains, live in solitude, abandon wives and children, practice fasting, embrace non-action, and sit in meditation—taking these as the Dao. How deluded!\n\nIf one does not employ yin and yang, does not investigate the Five Phases, cannot distinguish metal and wood, does not recognize dragon and tiger, does not understand lead and mercury, and remains ignorant of *Kan* and *Li*—how can one achieve the Dao through mere silence? Thus, this book vigorously corrects such errors, repeatedly stating that only the union of yin and yang constitutes the Dao. Just as a hen without a rooster hatches chicks that do not survive—pure yin without yang—if one wishes to raise chicks, one must fill a vessel with water at noon and warm it in the sun, borrowing yang *qi* to complete them. Without warmth, they will not hatch.\n\nWhy? Because, like creation itself, the union is incomplete, the Three and Five unjoined, hardness and softness sundered. How can the way of ceaseless generation arise? Thus, in the Land of Women, where no men exist, if they wish to conceive, they must choose a day and, at three times daily, gaze into the well, borrowing the *qi* of true water. Observing the reflection in the well as a means of union, they may become pregnant. This is the essence of yin and yang’s transformative power—the natural resonance of heaven and earth. Fire rises, water descends; no master guides them so. The origin is governed by rectitude; once the *qi* is set, the *Yi* says: *\"Great indeed is Qian’s primal power! All things receive their beginning from it; it governs heaven.\"* The Dao of Qian transforms and rectifies each being’s nature and destiny. Once nature and destiny are rectified, how can they be altered? Thus, observe the moment when male and female unite: hardness and softness bind inseparably, attaining their proper rhythm without craft or control. The male is born prone, the female curled—these are the utmost principles, unalterable by creation itself. Not only in life, but even in drowning, the male lies prone, the female curled. No parent teaches this; it is fixed at the moment of union, predetermined from the start. To the vulgar eye, such words may seem trivial, but the author’s intent is to illuminate the principles of yin and yang, repeating them often without tedium.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: Mutual Need of Male and Female**\n*Kan* male is the moon; *Li* female is the sun. The sun bestows virtue; the moon unfurls its light. The moon receives the sun’s transformation, its body unharmed. If yang loses its bond, yin encroaches upon its brightness. At the new moon, they draw near, eclipsing and obscuring one another, vying for dominance. Yang’s form diminishes; yin’s encroachment brings calamity. Male and female depend on one another, earth nourishing them. Yin and yang intermingle, seeking one another. Metal transforms into water, water’s nature circulating freely. Fire transforms into earth; without earth, water cannot flow. The male moves outward; the female remains inwardly still. If yang overflows beyond measure, it is constrained by yin, the po restraining the hun. Without excess or deficiency, neither cold nor heat, advancing and retreating in harmony, each attains equilibrium, both emitting confirming signs.\n\n*Kan* is water, the moon, the middle son—externally yin, internally yang, containing *wu* earth to store metal and water, nurturing its yin po. It is the gate of the middle essence, the doorway of Dao and righteousness—the white within black.\n\n*Li* is fire, the sun, the middle daughter—internally yin, externally yang, containing *si* earth to house cinnabar mercury, governing its yang hun. It is the embodiment of nature, the vessel of benevolence and virtue—the black within white.\n\nThe moon’s body is inherently dark; receiving the sun’s transformation, its light and luster return, its body unharmed. If yang loses its bond—its union—yin encroaches upon its brightness. At the new moon, when the moon obscures the sun’s light, the sun’s body is above, the moon below, temporarily blocking the sun’s radiance. This is called yang’s form diminishing, yin’s encroachment bringing calamity. Thus, people cannot preserve true yang, repeatedly scorched by yin’s encroachment.\n\nWhen yin and yang are inverted and mutually stimulated, male and female depend on one another, seeking the mechanism of transformation. Then *Dui* metal generates *Kan* water. Without true earth, *Kan* water overflows. *Li* contains fire, which generates *si* earth to restrain *Kan* water, preventing its overflow.\n\nThus, the Dao of man is the *qian* trigram—firm and outwardly active; the virtue of woman is the *kun* trigram—quiescent and inwardly stored. If *qian*’s outward activity exceeds its measure and transgresses its bounds, it is constrained by the *kun* woman’s power, the *po* restraining the *hun*. The *po* pertains to *Dui*, the *hun* to *Zhen*. *Zhen* is male, *Dui* is female. When yin and yang unite, they must not indulge in excess or luxury; rather, let there be a cycle of cold and heat, each advancing and retreating in harmony, timely and unerring. Only then will male and female each emit their signs of verification, and their efficacy be made manifest.\n\nThe gist of this chapter lies in this: when one exceeds bounds, indulges in excess, or transgresses measure, yin encroaches and calamity arises. Thus, in midwinter, summer’s commands bring scorching heat; in midsummer, winter’s commands return bitter cold. This is when the male acts but the female does not follow, yang sings but yin does not harmonize—yin and yang fall into discord, all due to exceeding bounds and indulging in excess.\n\nThe elixir is not easily refined; take heed not to treat it lightly. The Venerable Pure Yang, having received the transmission from the Immortal Elder Zhongli, entered seclusion and repeatedly labored, yet found his work not yet perfected and the elixir not yet formed. Later, he was granted the *Mirror of Ingredients* by the Perfected Master Cui of Mysterious Origin, through which he gained thorough understanding. He then composed a poem:\n\n*Beholding Master Cui’s Mirror of Ingredients,*\n*The mind’s terrain grows ever clearer.*\nThereafter, his practice swiftly bore fruit.\n\nFoolish men of later times, relying solely on “non-action” and emptiness as the Dao, drift through days in vague uncertainty, letting life and death take their course—these are the great sinners of the teaching. How dare they speak of cultivation?\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight: The Four in Chaos**\n\nWhen cinnabar and wood-essence obtain metal, they unite; where metal and water meet, wood and fire become companions. The four in chaos are arrayed as dragon and tiger: the dragon is yang, its number odd; the tiger is yin, its number even. The liver, green, is the father of fire; the lungs, white, are the mother of water; the kidneys, black, are the child of metal; *Li*, red, is the daughter of wood; the spleen, yellow, is the ancestor of the four. *Zi* and *Wu* mark the beginning. These three things form one family, all returning to *Wu* and *Si*.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: The most numinous and precious in the human body are essence and *qi*. The *Heart Seal Scripture* regards them as the supreme medicine; Zhang Ziyang calls them the treasure of life. The books composed by immortals share common ground yet differ. What is common? When metal returns to water, it is first called the Reverted Elixir—this is the simplest and most universal. What differs? *Qian* and *Kun*, *Kan* and *Li*; the female and male, the bellows and key; opening and closing; non-being and being; yin and yang; sun and moon; the Mysterious Female; *Wu* and *Si*; hardness and softness; male and female; the Dipper’s pivot and the Northern Asterism; the Raven and Hare; *hun* and *po*; metal and *qi*; spirit and brightness; the Yellow Sprout; the River Chariot; lead and silver; cinnabar and mercury; floating and sinking; black and white; the Primordial Chaos; the indistinct and vague; the compass’s center; the pivot’s pin; emptiness and nothingness; the dim and distant; the Perfected Man; the Great Abyss; the walls and gates; Penglai; the Vermilion Bird; the Dark Warrior; the White Tiger; the Azure Dragon; the pivot’s burning; the flowing pearl; golden cinnabar; liquid silver; the Eight White Stones; yellow earth; the two apertures; the abode of numinous virtue; the recumbent moon furnace; the suspended embryo tripod; the red-colored gate; the bright window’s dust; the upper and lower *kun*; civil and martial fire; cinnabar and wood-essence; the maiden of the River’s shore; the city walls of Yin and E; horse-teeth coral; the forbidden gate; the knife’s tip; golden radiance; autumn stone; emotion and nature; host and guest; white snow; the yellow chariot; the Mysterious Ditch; the River Drum; Mount Zeng; the gnomon’s shadow; stalactite; the verdant fluid; the Three and Five; the Two and Seven; grains and ounces; hexagrams and tally-signs—such names and forms are all treasures within the body. Some are metaphors for gates and doors, some for the chamber of spirit, some for the tripod and vessel, some for function and form, some for shapes and images, some for advance and retreat. Thus, the *Yijing* takes *qian*’s straightness and *kun*’s opening as the gate of life and death; the elixir method takes the Magpie Bridge and the Yellow Path as the road of coming and going—yet all do not depart from the body’s essence and *qi*.\n\nThese are provisional names with differing terms. Thus, this chapter speaks of cinnabar and wood-essence obtaining metal and uniting, echoing the earlier meaning of the sun’s flowing pearl ever desiring to leave man, only to be turned and bound by golden radiance—this is the same principle.\n\nThe flowing pearl, the maiden, and cinnabar are all inherently yin, lacking yang, belonging to the posterior heaven, and thus unable to form the elixir. Metal, the Yellow Sprout, and golden radiance are the prior-heaven lead that can refine the Reverted Elixir. Thus, cinnabar and wood-essence are the mercury within *Li*, the father of fire, the wood of *jia* and *yi* in the east that generates true essence—this is called the central daughter. Therefore, the wood of *jia* and *yi* in the east and the fire of *bing* and *ding* in the south are one father and one daughter. The father and his daughter are yang within yin, so *Zhen* wood and *Li* fire become companions. The Yellow Sprout and golden fluid are the lead within *Kan*, the mother of water, the metal of *geng* and *xin* in the west that nurtures its fluid to become the central son. Thus, the metal of *geng* and *xin* in the west and the water of *ren* and *gui* in the north are one mother and one child. The mother and her child are yin within yang, so *Dui* metal and *Kan* water unite. Wood, fire, metal, and water—these four in chaos are arrayed as dragon and tiger, one in the east and one in the west. The dragon dwells in the east, its number three, thus the dragon is yang, its number odd; the tiger belongs to the west, its number four, thus the tiger is yin, its number even. Wood and fire are companions, for the dragon emerges from fire; metal and water unite, for the tiger is born from water. The liver, green, pertains to wood and is the father of fire; the lungs, white, pertain to metal and are the mother of water; the kidneys, black, pertain to water and are the child of metal; *Li*, red, pertains to fire and is the daughter of wood; the spleen, yellow, pertains to earth and is the ancestor of the four. The child begins the five phases, thus is the first of the one yang. Metal and water, wood and fire, dragon and tiger—these are the three things. If these three things interact and form one family, they must rely on the power of *Wu* and *Si* earth to accomplish their function.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: The Punishment and Virtue of Mao and You**\n\nHardness and softness alternate, traversing and distributing. The dragon is west, the tiger east; *Mao* and *You* establish the warp, punishment and virtue guard and assist, meeting in joy. Punishment governs subjugation and killing; virtue governs generation and arising. In the second month, the elm scatters, the *Kui* star descends upon *Mao*; in the eighth month, wheat sprouts, the *Tian Gang* star occupies *You*. *Zi* is south, *Wu* is north, mutually serving as the warp and weft. The number one and nine end and begin again, containing the primordial, the Void and Danger spreading essence to *Zi*.\n\nThe Azure Dragon belongs to the east, the White Tiger to the west—this is their proper place. “Traversing and distributing” means the Azure Dragon establishes the warp in *You*, the White Tiger establishes the warp in *Mao*—punishment and virtue guard and assist, dragon and tiger meet in joy, overturned and intermingled. Thus, when dragon and tiger meet and guard, uniting in one place, the two things rejoice, governing generation as virtue. If the dragon is in the east and the tiger in the west, each fixed in its position, self-generating and self-flourishing, the two things contend and disturb, governing killing as punishment. Punishment is the meaning of yin and yang in discord, the metaphor of male and female meeting. Punishment is the five phases proceeding in order; virtue is the five phases overturned. Punishment is yin diminishing its yang; virtue is yang uniting with...\n\nWhen yin governs punishment, yin is abundant and yang scarce; when yang governs virtue, yin is scarce and yang abundant. Take, for instance, the hexagram of the second month, with four yang and two yin lines: as yang grows and yin recedes, though yang is abundant, it remains in surplus. When yang is in surplus, it governs virtue; when yin is in surplus, it governs killing. Thus, in the three spring months, the myriad things flourish together, yet the elm’s pods fall—just as with humans. In the prime of youth, when yang is abundant and yin scarce in the body, one grows stronger day by day. Yet at this time, the fire of desire blazes fiercely; though yang is abundant, it is consumed by yin. Even if some yang remains, it cannot govern, and the hundred diseases invade. As yang nears depletion, one still clings to the realm of desire, exhausting all effort to seek yin. The remaining yang encounters yin and is entirely consumed, leading to sudden death—this is what it means for virtue to revert to punishment.\n\nIf one of superior wisdom seizes the remaining yang as a stepping-stone and swiftly practices the Way of Returning the Elixir, one may regain long life—this is what it means for punishment and virtue to guard and assist each other, for mutual encounter to bring joy.\n\nTake, for another instance, the hexagram of the eighth month, with four yin and two yang lines: yang is consumed by yin, and though yin is abundant, some surplus yang remains. When yin is in surplus, it governs punishment; when yang is in surplus, it governs generation. Thus, in the three autumn months, the myriad things wither, yet the shepherd’s purse and wheat begin to sprout—just as with humans. When one nears sixty-one, yin is abundant and yang scarce in the body, and one grows weaker day by day. Yet if at this time one is fortunate to retain some surplus yang and practices the Way of the Golden Elixir, one may restore yang—this is what it means to return to youth and regain one’s vitality. This is what it means by long life and enduring vision, for punishment to revert to virtue.\n\nAt the midnight hour of the second month, the Dipper’s *kui* star aligns with the *mao* position, while the *gang* star rests above *si*; this upper position belongs to the south, governing generation as virtue. In the eighth month at the *xu* hour, the Dipper’s *gang* star occupies the *you* earth, and the *kui* star aligns with *hai*; this upper position lies in the northwest, governing destruction as punishment. The classic states: when the *gang* star points to *chou*, its body resides in *wei*—what it points to is auspicious, where it resides is inauspicious. The same applies to all other positions. This illustrates the function of refining the Golden Elixir.\n\n*Zi* (north) inverted becomes south, *wu* (south) inverted becomes north—this is the reversal of the Five Phases. The immortals and sages say: when the Five Phases proceed in sequence, they become the fiery pit of the *dharmadhātu*; when the Five Phases are inverted, they become the Seven Treasures of the great earth. Thus, only when water and fire serve as mutual guiding principles can the *Completion* be achieved.\n\nYang arises at one and culminates at nine; when yang’s number reaches nine, it reaches its limit, and at its limit, it returns to one. This is called the cycle of one and nine, ending and beginning anew. The *Xu* and *Wei* lodges sow essence at *zi*—the success of the Elixir lies in these two lines. For *Xu* and *Wei* are the *kan* of the union of sun and moon, the place where the first yang arises, the coiled lair of the serpent. Thus, the Great One contains the primordial *qi* of the precelestial, and its true essence is sown at *zi*. This again corresponds to the principle of *zi* and *wu* as the beginning of the cycle, as discussed in the previous chapter.\n\nOrdinary people merely hear that *mao* and *you* are for bathing, yet how can they understand the metaphor of punishment and virtue? Virtue and generation are like obtaining the medicine in half an hour, while punishment and destruction are like losing it in an instant. Therefore, when entering the chamber, one must guard against danger and contemplate peril to refine the Elixir. The immortal elder compares this to the flourishing of spring, when all things grow—yet even the elm’s pods wither. Here, virtue guards against punishment, and generation guards against destruction. In the solemnity of autumn, when all things wither, shepherd’s purse and wheat still sprout. Here, punishment contains virtue, and destruction contains generation.\n\nThis book discusses these matters with utmost clarity, illuminating them in every way. Its sublime intent lies solely in obtaining the precelestial *qi*.\n\n*Chapter Thirty: \"The Gentleman Seeks a Mate\"*\n\nThe *guan-guan* osprey calls on the river isle;\nGraceful and fair, the maiden is the gentleman’s mate.\nThe male does not dwell alone, nor the female in solitude.\nLike the coiling black dragon and the twisting serpent,\nThey entwine to show the intent of yin and yang—\nEach must depend on the other.\n\nWere two women to share a chamber,\nThough their beauty be radiant,\nThough Su Qin’s eloquence and Zhang Yi’s persuasions,\nThough matchmakers deploy honeyed words,\nThough silver tongues unfurl and sweet phrases press,\nThough hearts align in perfect harmony—\nYet hair may rot and teeth decay,\nAnd still they shall never know each other.\n\nIf herbs and minerals are not of the same kind,\nIf their divisions differ and their measures clash,\nIf their warp and weft are lost,\nThen even if the Yellow Emperor tends the furnace,\nThe Grand Duke stokes the fire,\nThe Eight Lords pound and refine,\nHuainan blends and harmonizes,\nA towering altar is raised with jade steps,\nUnicorn jerky and phoenix fat are offered,\nRegisters are held and long kneeling pleas ascend,\nSpirits are entreated with lament,\nAll gods bathe in purification and fast in reverence,\nHoping for some sign—\nIt is no different from mending a cauldron with glue,\nOr plastering a wound with salt,\nOr adding ice to dispel cold,\nOr boiling water to fly the phoenix and dance the serpent—\nOnly to see them grow ever more perverse.\n\nThe immortal elder points directly: the Golden Elixir\nMust have herbs of the same kind.\nOne yin, one yang—\nOnly through their mutual resonance,\nOne female, one male—\nCan transformation and generation arise.\nIf one dwells alone in solitude,\nWhere lies the mechanism of ceaseless transformation?\nIf many females lack a male,\nWhere is the Way of endless generation?\nTo refine the Returned Elixir,\nOne must seek the precelestial *qi* to accomplish it.\n\nThis chapter’s words are plain and need no repetition.\nYet the one who composed this book reveals the mechanism of Heaven and Earth’s creation,\nGathers the virtue of Qian and Kun’s generation,\nIlluminates the principle of the sun and moon’s conjoined brightness,\nAnd discloses the merit of reversing yin and yang’s course.\n\nThe *Yijing* says:\n“To unite with Heaven and Earth in virtue,\nTo unite with the sun and moon in brightness,\nTo unite with the four seasons in sequence,\nTo unite with gods and spirits in fortune and misfortune—\nWhether preceding Heaven and Heaven does not oppose,\nOr following Heaven and serving its time,\nEven Heaven does not oppose—\nHow much less man?”\n\nThe master of this Way is the sage.\nThe practitioner of this Way is the divine person.\n\nThis book, in every place and at all times,\nIs constantly guarded by Heaven and Earth, gods and spirits,\nThe sun and moon, stars and constellations,\nThunder and the myriad deities.\nWhen the worthy and wise reverently receive and recite it ten thousand times,\nImmortal perfected ones descend to the courtyard to impart the supreme Dao.\nBut if the foolish and ignorant recklessly slander it,\nThen gods and spirits shall secretly record their transgressions in the Black Register.\nMinor offenses bring malignant illness to the body;\nMajor offenses hasten the reckoning of the Dark Bureau.\nThey will but become ghosts of the nether darkness,\nOr sink forever into the sea of suffering.\n\n*Felicity and Calamity Clearly Manifest—Take Heed!*\n\n*Commentary on the \"Zhouyi Cantong Qi\" Divided into Chapters, Middle Volume*\n*Commentary on the \"Zhouyi Cantong Qi\" Divided into Chapters, Lower Volume*\n*Chapter Thirty-One: \"The Sage Refines in Seclusion\"*\n\nThe ancient sages and worthies, embracing the Mysterious and holding fast to the True, secluded themselves to refine the Nine Cauldrons, transforming their traces and concealing their luminosity. They nurtured essence, cultivated spirit, and penetrated the virtue of the Three Luminaries. Their fluids and pores, sinews and bones, became firm; all perverse influences were dispelled, and the upright qi abided long. Through long accumulation, they transformed their forms and became immortals.\n\nMoved by compassion for later generations who cherished the Dao, they followed the winds of inspiration, tracing ancient texts and composing diagrams and scriptures to enlighten posterity. Yet they revealed only branches and leaves, concealing the root, or adopted various names to obscure the truth. Many literati, obtaining these works, treasured them in caskets, passing them down as a family legacy from father to son and grandson to grandson. Yet through the ages, delusion prevailed, and none perceived their meaning. Thus, officials abandoned their posts, farmers neglected their plowing, merchants forsook their goods, and scholars, though aspiring, remained impoverished. I grieve deeply for them.\n\nHerein, I record these words, concise in form yet profound in meaning, sparing in detail yet rich in substance. I set forth their principles clearly, with measured steps and numbered divisions, that they may be observed and followed. Yet because the sequence has been disrupted and the language disordered, the gates and apertures remain obscure. Let the wise ponder carefully and guard their intentions.\n\nThe great sages of antiquity necessarily comprehended the supreme Dao. Thus, the writings of Fuxi, Shennong, and the Yellow Emperor all expound the Great Dao, and the *Yin Fu Jing* abides eternally in its three hundred and fifteen characters. Later generations, failing to grasp the Dao, wildly conjectured about the text, claiming that a hundred words expound the Dao, another hundred the method, and yet another hundred the technique. Such men are deaf and blind to the world—how could they fathom the Dao of the sages?\n\nThe *Yin Fu Jing* begins with \"Observing the Dao of Heaven\" in one hundred and twenty characters, which sets forth the guiding principles of the Dao. The next ninety-one characters, \"The Dao of Heaven and Earth and the Myriad Things,\" describe its practical application. The final one hundred and four characters, \"Though Blind, They Hear Well,\" reveal the essentials of success. Thus, the Yellow Emperor refined the Nine Cauldrons at Mount Dinghu, achieving the Great Elixir and ascending on a dragon. This was not the alchemy of refining metals, minerals, herbs, or plants, but the subjugation of primordial qi to form the Elixir. Thus, it is called \"subduing and refining,\" not \"ingesting and refining.\"\n\nThe term \"subduing and refining\" encompasses specific practices. Embracing the Mysterious and holding fast to the True, transforming one’s traces and concealing one’s luminosity, nurturing essence and cultivating spirit, and penetrating the virtue of the Three Luminaries—these seven are the primary undertakings, called the \"furnace and fire,\" which is what is meant by \"refining the self.\" If one can refine the self, the true qi will suffuse the entire body, warming it like fire in a furnace—hence the terms \"furnace and fire\" and \"refining the self.\"\n\nThe firming of fluids and pores, sinews and bones, the dispelling of perverse influences, and the enduring presence of upright qi—these four are called \"subduing the qi,\" which is what is meant by \"refining the Elixir.\" Embracing the Mysterious means inwardly harboring the singular qi of the Mysterious; holding fast to the True means embracing the authentic truth of the Great One. Transforming one’s traces means concealing one’s light and hiding one’s tracks, so that few know me, and those who recognize me are rare. Concealing one’s luminosity means sinking into obscurity, making oneself unrecognizable. Thus, the ancients who excelled as scholars were subtle, mysterious, and profoundly unknowable. Nurturing essence means saturating oneself with the eternal essence of the True to refine the self. Cultivating spirit means outwardly nourishing the spirit of the entire body to harmonize with the qi. Accumulating merit to this point is the great essential of penetrating the virtue of the Three Luminaries.\n\nVirtue is the highest endeavor in the practice of the Dao. To cultivate the Dao without cultivating virtue is to possess yin but lack yang; only when virtue and Dao are both cultivated do yin and yang naturally unite. Those who cultivate virtue may claim to possess it, yet in truth, they do not, for their virtue is tainted by deluded thoughts and fails to resonate. The deeper and more sincere one’s virtue, the less one thinks of it. Heaven and Earth, the gods and spirits, the sun, moon, and stars—all respond to virtue. Zhang, Ge, and Xu accumulated and cultivated virtue with a sincere heart, aspiring to this resonance—this is what is meant by \"penetrating the virtue of the Three Luminaries.\"\n\nOnly after diligently refining the self and accumulating virtue to the point of resonance can one subdue and refine the Great Elixir. The fluids and pores refer to the Jade Fluid—White Snow—and the Golden Liquid—Yellow Sprout. When Jade Fluid and Golden Liquid permeate the Chamber of Spirit, the sinews and bones of the entire body become firm. All perverse influences within the hundred bones are dispelled, and the primordial yang of upright qi abides long. Through long accumulation, one transforms form and becomes an immortal. This is what the Yellow Emperor’s refinement of the Nine Cauldrons and the Great Elixir signifies.\n\nThe *Qingfu Lu* states: In his first life, the Xuanyuan clan served as commoners; in his second, as ministers; and in his third, as sovereigns. After accumulating merit to its fullness, they ascended to Heaven. Following the *Yin Fu Jing*, the sagely succession is recorded in the classics: King Wen’s *Zhouyi* clarifies the gates of Qian and Kun; the *Xici* of Confucius elucidates the meaning of Qian’s activity and Kun’s receptivity; the *Daodejing* of five thousand characters reveals the gates of being and non-being, mystery and the female; Zisi’s *Zhongyong* defines destiny as nature and following nature as the Dao; Mencius’s *Yang Hao* expounds the utmost greatness and firmness, nurturing uprightness without harm. The teachings of Lao Peng and the metaphors of Zhuang Peng—all trace the path from sage to immortal.\n\nMoved by compassion for later scholars who cherish the Dao, the ancients followed their inspiration, tracing texts and composing diagrams and scriptures to enlighten posterity. Sometimes they revealed branches and leaves while concealing the root, or adopted various names to obscure the truth. The \"revealed branches\" refer to partial disclosures, such as \"Qian and Kun are the gates of the Changes.\" The root, however, must be transmitted orally—hence its concealment.\n\nThe \"adopted names to obscure the truth\" means that the teachings could not be stated openly; instead, metaphors and analogies were scattered throughout the texts. Later, those with discerning eyes who obtained these writings but did not encounter a teacher treasured them in secret for life. Only those of true capacity, like the descendants of a noble lineage, could carry on the tradition. Yet many students, though they possessed these texts, lacked a teacher’s guidance and fell into delusion, leading others astray onto crooked paths. They knew nothing of yin and yang, confused the Five Phases, and drowned in chaos.\n\nLater practitioners of the Dao, relying solely on these texts without oral transmission, are like scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants who have lost their livelihoods: officials seek office but find no path to the register; farmers desire to till but have no land to plow; artisans hold their skills but cannot apply them; merchants calculate profits but lose their capital. Likewise, though students possess the texts, without a teacher’s instruction, they have no starting point, and their wild conjectures and reckless actions cannot lead to the Dao. The immortal sages, moved by compassion, opened the refining furnace and recorded these words as a memento for the world. The language is concise, the meaning easy to ponder—like the line \"The true man hides in the deep abyss,\" where the matter is simple yet the principle unfolds. Or \"When gold comes, the nature returns to its origin,\" where the principles are set forth clearly.\n\nThe preceding section is divided into fifteen chapters, revealing the workings of yin and yang and the creation of the Elixir from beginning to end. The middle section is divided into fifteen chapters, detailing the measured steps and signs. The final section comprises five chapters on the symbolic forms and completion. Later readers, observing these divisions and verifying their substance, will find them easy to peruse. The numbers and measurements within all follow proper methods. With a teacher’s guidance and adherence to this sequence, one can achieve the Elixir.\n\nThe \"disordered language\" refers to the use of adopted names to obscure the truth. The \"gates and apertures\" encompass the profound mysteries of the Mysterious, serving as the ladder through the great kalpa and the torch illuminating the path for those lost in darkness. Let later sages and near-sages ponder carefully and employ them with care.\n\nThe Great Dao is not comprehended by those who are not sages, nor spoken of by those who are not worthies. Thus, fathers do not transmit it to their sons, nor ministers present it to their rulers. The Dao of the sages—how could it be transmitted lightly? They feared that without virtue, it would be difficult to bear, and that careless words might lead to downfall. Hence, the admonition: let the wise ponder carefully and guard their intentions.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two: The Completion of Symbolic Forms**\n\nNo symbolic form is greater than Heaven and Earth. The Mysterious Trench spans ten thousand *li*; the River Drum faces the Star Marker—all people are struck with terror. The sundial’s shadow advances and retreats errantly; for nine years, calamity befalls. The August Emperor gazes upon it, and the king retreats to reform himself. The pivot’s rise and fall bring harm and ruin, causing the Yangzi and Huai to run dry, their waters flowing into the sea.\n\nHeaven and Earth’s feminine and masculine forces waver between *zi* and *wu*, *yin* and *shen*—yin and yang’s ancestors, emerging and entering, ever returning to their beginning. Following the Dipper’s handle, grasping the balance to fix the primal order, one ascends to the Steamer Mountain, where flames blaze and the White Tiger’s path chants ahead, while the Azure Essence harmonizes behind. The Vermilion Bird soars and plays, its feathers shimmering with five hues. Nets are cast, pressing down so it cannot rise—its wails are mournful, like an infant longing for its mother. Overturned into the boiling cauldron, its feathers and fur are crushed and broken. Before half a *ke* has passed, fish scales bristle, their fins stirring. The five colors gleam and dazzle, transforming without constancy. The cauldron seethes and surges, boiling violently without cease. Layer upon layer piles up, jagged as interlocking dog’s teeth, resembling midwinter ice. Jade-like stalactites and stalagmites mingle in towering confusion, propping one another up. Yin and yang find their match, dwelling together in tranquil harmony.\n\nThe Green Dragon resides in Chamber Six, spring’s blossoms trembling in the east at *mao*. The White Tiger dwells in Pleiades Seven, autumn’s awns withering in the west at *you*. The Vermilion Bird abides in Spread Two, the true yang mingling in the south at *wu*. When these three come to court together, their kin become companions. Originally but two things, in the end they become three. Three and five join with one, all gathering to return to two. The method of governance follows the above model; the days’ count takes the first as white, then yellow, red, and black, penetrating both inner and outer. This is called the First Cauldron, its sustenance like a grain of millet. It arises from nature’s workings, free of deceit or falsehood.\n\nThe mountains and marshes steam together, giving rise to clouds and rain. Mud dries to become dust; fire extinguishes to turn to earth. As the *huangbo* dyes yellow, the indigo becomes green. Boiling hides and skins makes glue; fermenting yeast transforms into wine. Though the workings are easily applied, without the seed, skill is in vain. Only this wondrous art is precise and truthful, its words transmitted to a hundred million generations, luminous and verifiable, shining like the Milky Way, radiant as the sea’s source.\n\nPonder deeply to ensure mastery, reviewing again and again—up and down a thousand cycles, ten thousand times—until the divine light may be glimpsed. The spirit may reveal it to others, or the heart may suddenly awaken. Seek the thread’s end, grasp its beginning, and you will find the gate and door. Entering the Dao, there is no path that does not return to the worthy.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: The sages’ Dao encompasses Heaven and Earth, yet enters the tiniest speck of dust. It is spoken of as vast yet utterly refined, lofty and luminous, the mean within the Dao. The Dao is Heaven’s secret, not displayed on bamboo or silk, passed only from mouth to mouth. The sages had no choice but to employ every metaphor to guide posterity.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor’s questions to Qi Bo began: \"When essence is insufficient, replenish it with flavor; when form is insufficient, replenish it with *qi*.\" These words alone reveal the Golden Elixir. King Wen’s *Yi* deepened Fu Xi’s: \"In the southwest, one gains a friend\"—this, too, discloses the method of replenishing *qi*. Confucius said: \"Like sounds resonate; like *qi* seeks its kind\"—this points to the art of replenishing *qi*. Laozi declared: \"The gate of the Mysterious Female is the root of Heaven and Earth\"—this clarifies the gate of replenishing *qi*. The *Cantong Qi* explicitly instructs on medicines, cauldrons, weights, fire phases, and the mutual dependence of metal and *qi*. The Perfected One’s teachings in the *Deep Abyss* are the clearest and most incisive. In the later chapters, symbolic analogies are used—sage after sage transmits it, yet the principle remains one.\n\nThus, the Ninefold Return of Golden Liquor and the Great Elixir serve but to replenish that single *qi*. Yet to replenish yin, one must use yang; to replenish yang, one must use yin—this is the *qi* of the Supreme Ultimate.\n\nWhat is meant by \"gold\"? What by \"elixir\"? The *qian*-beginning is gold; the *kun*-beginning is elixir. At *qian*’s inception, the Supreme Ultimate’s gold adheres to *kun*; at *kun*’s inception, the Supreme Ultimate’s *qi* transforms into elixir. *Qian*’s gold spreads through *kun*’s meridians, then flows and turns. The Metal Dragon resides in *dui*; *dui*’s metal generates water, and water’s inception gives birth to elixir. The elixir lies in the Tiger’s pen, for the tiger is born in water, dwelling in the west. To conjoin the elixir, first subdue the dragon. The dragon’s home is wood, manifesting in *li*; *li* holds yin fire, so the dragon emerges from within fire.\n\nThe dragon dwells in the east, the nine *qi* of the Azure Heaven, where the Green Emperor’s key governs as the true master, giving life to the myriad things. The tiger dwells in the west, the seven *qi* of the White Heaven, where the White Emperor’s bellows forge transformations, producing the myriad things. From west to east spans tens of thousands of *li*—yet the immortals use Heaven and Earth to illustrate *li* and *kan*, gold and water to compare the Mysterious Trench and River Drum, the Star Marker to liken the union’s defense. The sundial’s advance and retreat mirror the dragon’s ascent; the August Emperor’s gaze symbolizes sudden enlightenment. The pivot’s harm and ruin represent gathering and sealing. The feminine and masculine signify *zi* and *wu*; emergence and entry signify *yin* and *shen*. The Steamer Mountain is the gate of the distant and profound; the *Zhaoyao* is the portal of the indistinct and vague. The White Tiger is metal’s essence; the Vermilion Bird is fire’s spirit. The net’s casting signifies the initial step; the boiling cauldron represents refinement. The cauldron’s seething, violent surging—this is the *qi*’s fullness.\n\nThe continuous layering and piling serve to accumulate the elixir. *Lan* jade, stalactites, and cinnabar begin to take form, their images intermingled, their virtues conjoined with yin and yang. The Green Dragon resides in *Fang*, entering the chamber to complete the affair; the White Tiger stands in *Mao*, obtaining the medicine and returning to the furnace. The Vermilion Bird dwells in *Zhang*, its spirit already merged—these two substances are lead and mercury.\n\nThe \"three and five\" cluster the Five Phases; the \"one\" is the water of *Kan*, the \"two\" is the furnace of *Li*. The sequence of white followed by yellow: white is metal, yellow is the earth’s form. Red and black penetrate inner and outer: red is the countenance of fire, black is the body of lead. When the Five Phases are complete and yin and yang are sealed, it is called \"one cauldron,\" as small as a millet grain. As the *Classic* states: \"The Primal Beginning suspended a single precious pearl, as large as a millet grain, within the Void’s midst\"—this is it. These are the workings of the natural, all the Dao of yin-yang’s creation and transformation, spontaneous resonance and communication. It is not a deviant or false path, nor the side gates of *cai-zhan*, the left-hand arts, or heterodox techniques.\n\nWhen mountains and marshes steam with *qi*, it illustrates the golden elixir—yin and yang’s *qi* steaming together to form *ni-jie*, which then becomes dust. This compares to true *qi* entering the cauldron and congealing into the elixir. Dyeing yellow with *huangbo*, green with indigo; boiling hides into glue, fermenting grain into wine—these analogies show that obtaining the golden liquid must yield the Reverted Elixir.\n\n\"Alike in ease when work is applied\": as *Qian* takes *Kun* as its counterpart, *Zhen* takes *Dui* as its counterpart, then yin and yang harmonize, and work is easily applied. It is not like planting with difficulty or crafting with skill: as *Dui* takes *Gen* as its seed, or yin takes the feminine as its seed—if two women dwell together, how can creation be achieved?\n\nThis wondrous art is clear and true, not deceptive words bequeathed to the myriad ages to come. This book and this Dao are like stars in the sky—who cannot behold them? Like the sea as the source of waters—what divergent streams exist? Though ten thousand ages pass, none can depart from this Dao. Study it in detail, ponder it deeply, and after ten thousand repetitions, you will naturally feel the divine spirits informing you, or your heart’s spirit will awaken on its own.\n\nThe sages and worthies, in writing books, ensure the end responds to the beginning. In the first chapter of this book’s upper scroll, it says: \"Qian and Kun are the gates and doors of the *Yi*.\" Here, in the final chapter, it directly states: \"Seek the thread, trace its beginnings—you must find its gates and doors.\" This is called \"returning to the origin, reverting to the end.\" The Dao of Heaven is impartial, ever bequeathing. Those worthy ones who study the Dao should ponder this carefully.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three: The Wondrous Use of the Cauldron**\nThis chapter originally followed \"Imitating Images,\" for the cauldron is also an imitation of images. Peng Zhenyi said its words and principles are interconnected, its phrases fragmented, and placing it afterward is incorrect. The immortals and sages composed it with profound method—it cannot be lightly altered. Moreover, its lines all rhyme in groups of three, forming another structural pattern. Now, following the original text, it is corrected here.\n\n**Three and five inches, one *fen*.**\nThis clarifies the meaning of \"three, five, one.\" Throughout this book, \"three and five\" appears in eleven chapters: \"Three and five harmonize\" (Chapter 24); \"Three, five, and one—Heaven and Earth’s purest essence\" (Chapter 26); \"Three and five do not merge, hardness and softness part\" (Chapter 32). Previously, the two substances were secondary, becoming \"three and five\"; here, \"three, five, one\" begins the passage to make one thoroughly understand the meaning of \"three, five, one.\" Then one knows the cauldron possesses the wondrousness of \"three and five,\" the medicinal substances have the true fire of \"one inch,\" and thus the proper use of \"one *fen*\" is established. \"Round\" means mastery.\n\nIf one can master and thoroughly comprehend the essentials of \"three, five, one,\" one can refine the Great Elixir. Those who are not masterful in this matter merely cling to the cauldron’s dimensions of inches and *fen*—how shallow is that!\n\nConfucius said: \"Three and five transform and interweave their numbers; penetrate their transformations, and you complete the patterns of Heaven and Earth. Exhaust their numbers, and you complete the images of the world.\" The *Wuzhen Pian* states: \"Three, five, one—just two characters. From ancient times to now, those who truly understand are rare indeed.\" East three and south two together make five; north one and west four share the same. *Wu* and *Si* reside in their generative numbers. When the three families meet, they form the infant. The infant is the one containing true *qi*. Only those who are enlightened can enter the sage’s mechanism.\n\nThe numbers of yin and yang take *qi* as their master; the *qi* of the Five Phases arises from numbers. Thus, the east’s green *qi* is nine—the origin, benevolence, the virtue of wood, the generative number three, and hardness.\n\nThe essence—*jing*—is described in the ancient *Longhu Jing*: \"Transforming and changing, it becomes the Green Dragon, the yang wood.\" The south’s red *qi* is two, the refining fire. This is propriety, the virtue of fire, the generative number two, and softness. The blood—scripture states: \"Cinnabar flows into mercury, the father of yin fire.\" Yang wood gives birth to yin fire; *Li* is yang within yin, and yin is the middle daughter. Thus, *Li*’s daughter takes *Zhen* wood as her father, making wood the companion of fire. Their generative numbers, two and three, together form the one five—this is mercury within cinnabar, the self, the crucible. As Ziyang says: \"The golden crucible desires to retain mercury within the cinnabar.\"\n\nThe west’s white *qi* is seven, benefit. This is righteousness, the virtue of metal, the generative number four, and femininity. The fluid—scripture states: \"The feminine yin is ochre yellow gold, yin metal.\" The north’s black *qi* is five, truth. This is wisdom, the virtue of water, the generative number one, and masculinity. The *qi*—scripture states: \"The masculine yang is emerald dark water, yang water.\" Yin metal gives birth to yang water; *Kan* is yin within yang, the middle son. Thus, the son takes *Dui* metal as his mother, making metal and water dwell together. Their generative numbers, one and four, together form the one five—this is metal within water, the other.\n\nThe vessel. As Ziyang says: \"The jade pool first descends silver within water.\"\n\nThe center’s yellow *qi* is one, *ji* (the sixth Earthly Branch). This is spirit, the spirit of earth, the generative number five, and *wu* (the fifth Heavenly Stem). This is trust. Laozi says: \"Vast and obscure, within it there is essence; this essence is most true, within it there is trust.\" *Wu* and *ji* unite to form the essence of the two fives—when exquisitely conjoined and congealed, this is the coagulation of the golden elixir. This is called the \"three fives as one.\" This is called the crucible-vessel. When the three fives as one are summed, they form the number nine, returning to the original number nine of the east’s green *qi*—this is called the Great Elixir of Nine Returns.\n\nThe mouth is four times eight *liang*, the lips, two *cun*. Four and eight combine to make twelve, and adding the two *cun* of the feet makes fourteen. Fourteen is the first fullness of the moon in the heavens; the full moon is pure yang, and only with its yang purity can it generate the single yang’s golden essence within the crucible. The mouth and lips are the gate and portal where metal *qi* mutually assist—this is called the crucible’s mouth and the vessel’s lips. This is called the two sevens making fourteen. This is called the wondrous meaning of the seven returns.\n\nOrdinary people, not understanding the immortal elders’ wondrous secrets—hidden wonders within wonders, intentions beyond intention—seeing only the words \"mouth\" and \"lips,\" seek directly the crucible-vessel’s measurements. How would they know that the Great Elixir of Golden Fluid takes heaven and earth as its crucible-vessel? To compare and measure the golden elixir’s crucible-vessel is to compare and measure heaven and earth. Yet they do not know with what measuring tools to compare heaven and earth, nor from where to begin such measurement.\n\nHow would they know that the method of elixir refinement takes heaven and earth as the furnace and yin and yang as the fire? This is called the furnace-fire. It is like the human body—a small heaven and earth—taking the body as the furnace and essence-*qi* as the fire, not the furnace-fire and crucible-vessel of the five metals and eight stones.\n\nTwelve *cun* in length, thickness and thinness balanced. Twelve *cun* correspond to the twelve months of the year; \"length\" means year after year, twelve months each. If too thick, there is the flaw of remoteness; if too thin, the danger of weakness. Cultivators must know that each year has twelve months, and each month has a time when metal and water mutually generate. If the crucible-vessel is too thick, there is the suspicion of distant hope; if too thin, the peril of decline. \"Balanced\" is how one regulates and gathers it—regulation and gathering mean examining and awaiting it. Thus, the ancient sages concentrated the seventy-two seasonal nodes of a year into a single day and hour, with six nodes per day, each node having three talismans, using only the swiftness of one talisman. This is called the talisman-node, where thickness and thinness are balanced, regulation and gathering not erring by a hair’s breadth—only then is one permitted to refine the Great Elixir.\n\nThe belly, threefold alignment, sits and awaits warmth. The belly is the inner chamber of the elixir crucible. \"Alignment\" means aligning with the moon’s light. \"Three\" means it must be the third day. \"Sits\" means waiting; \"awaits\" means arrival; \"warmth\" means yang *qi* stirring. What is meant by \"aligning with the moon’s light\"? The moon in the heavens is called the Great Yin. Every month on the third day, at dusk, a single yang’s light is born above *gengshen*, resembling the *Zhen* trigram—*Zhen* is slight yang riding two yins. The elixir crucible is the same. The crucible-vessel among people is called the Lesser Yin. Every month on the third day at dusk, a single yang’s *qi* is born in the region of *ren* and *gui*, resembling the *Fu* trigram—*Fu* is one yang hidden beneath five yins. What is meant by \"sits and awaits warmth\"? When cultivators have obtained the crucible-vessel and encounter the evening of the third day, they must sit and await it, waiting for the fire-*qi* to arrive, neither cold nor dry but warm. At this moment, when yang *qi* is about to stir, one must swiftly refine the elixir.\n\nYin above, yang below rushing. Yin is the water within the vessel; yang is the fire within the crucible. Water above, fire below—water and fire thus intermingle. Yin above, yang below—earth and heaven in harmony. As the Elder Ziyang says: \"Though it be the host, I am the guest.\"\n\nBeginning and end with martial fire, the middle with civil fire. The first seventy days are the time of refining the self with martial fire. The final thirty days are the time of warming and nurturing with martial fire. In between, one practices the civil fire of a single talisman to refine the elixir. The initial seventy days of accumulated effort are the most difficult. The final thirty days refer to the time of warming and nurturing, which must be especially cautious. Seven days plus three decades, totaling two hundred and six, together make three hundred and sixty—the complete cycle of four nines, a full year’s days. Dividing three hundred and sixty days into seven parts for refining the self and three parts for warming and nurturing, if warming and nurturing last a year, then first refine the self for three years. Only the civil fire of elixir refinement in the middle requires half an hour. Thus, it is said that skillful regulation and balance in elixir refinement use half an hour’s single talisman civil fire, which is not included in the seventy, thirty, or two hundred and six. Scholars must carefully consider the words \"beginning,\" \"end,\" \"start,\" and \"finish\"—the civil fire in the middle stands apart and does not interfere.\n\nOrdinary people, seeing only the phrases \"seventy days\" and \"three decades,\" all assume a division of three parts civil and seven parts martial. How would they realize that the elixir classics conceal their mechanisms and dare not speak plainly? If one thoroughly understands that the moment of a single talisman is the time for obtaining the elixir, then the civil fire in the middle will naturally be guarded.\n\nYin fire, white sprout, lead—two sevens gather to assist and protect the person. Earth two generates fire; heaven seven completes cinnabar—this is the completion number of yin fire, one seven. Heaven one generates water; earth six completes lead—this is the combination number of the yellow sprout, one seven. Combining the numbers of lead and fire makes two sevens gather. Two sevens make fourteen. Using this fourteen of lead and fire to guard the crucible-vessel, its work assists and protects the person to form the elixir.\n\nNourishing the brain, stabilizing the mysterious ascent, the child dwells in the center, peacefully abiding. Coming and going, wandering without leaving the gate, gradually the great nature becomes pure, returning to the One, reverting to the original source. With good love and respect like ruler and minister, after one cycle, the effort is most arduous. Guard closely, guard closely—do not lose the way on the distant, dark, and mysterious path. If one attains this, heaven and earth’s knife and trowel will moisten the pure soul and spirit, obtaining long life and dwelling in the immortal village.\n\nThose who delight in the Dao seek its root, carefully weighing the five phases, determining the exact proportions. Reflect deeply—no need to discuss further. Conceal and guard, do not leak the text.\n\nThis passage, in simple terms, speaks of those who have obtained the medicine—there must be no laziness, not even for a moment, constantly and diligently exhorted. Each sentence is clear and needs no further explanation. Once the elixir is formed and the infant gradually grows, one may then undertake the nine-year upward work.\n\nRiding a white crane, driving dragon scales, roaming the Great Void, paying homage to the Immortal Lords, receiving celestial charts, and being titled a Perfected One—these are matters of elixir completion, Dao attainment, work fulfillment, and merit accomplished. Yet when merit is lofty and virtue weighty, the effects cannot be fully described. Because the supreme Dao is treasured by heaven above, and good roots and superior wisdom practice diligently without ceasing, cultivating both nature and life, refining both form and spirit, uniting with the Dao and becoming true—virtue is weighty, merit is lofty. This is like the words of earnest praise: paying homage to the Immortal Lords and being titled a Perfected One.\n\nEvery person can accomplish this great merit and attain this great freedom. Do not abandon yourself because the task is difficult; do not refrain because conditions are shallow. Laozi, Zhang, and Ge were also human—they did not fall from the heavens. Śākyamuni and Bodhidharma were also human—they did not well up from the earth. With firm resolve and courageous effort, all things are easily accomplished. Cultivators and scholars, think deeply and strive diligently.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Four: Mending Omissions and Filling Gaps**\n\nThose who expound the *Cantong Qi* often present its outlines but fail to maintain purity and unity, drifting into prolixity while neglecting finer precautions. Omissions and deficiencies remain, as if in shadow. Now, I have once more compiled and recorded this to mend gaps, refine profundities, and draw connections to ensure coherence—so that intent aligns and the path remains unobstructed. Thus, I compose this chapter, arranging the three phases in order, wherein the *Book of Changes*’ principles of nature and destiny are fully revealed.\n\n**乙** (Floating Right) – **丁** (Civil Fire)\n**己** (Substance) – **辛** (Worldly Silver) – **癸** (True Lead)\nFive positions harmonize:\nThree Wood, Two Fire, Five Earth, Four Metal, One Water.\n\n**甲** (Sinking Left) – **丙** (Martial Fire)\n**戊** (Elixir) – **庚** (Worldly Gold) – **壬** (True Mercury)\nEach has its counterpart.\n\nThe *Book of Changes*’ nature and destiny adhere to their measures; the Yellow Emperor and Laozi thoroughly investigated and mastered the art of furnace and fire, grounding it in truth. The Three Ways emerge from the One, their paths branching like stems, leaves, flowers, and fruit—yet all depend on the root. Do not lose the original simplicity. What I speak is sincere and without error.\n\nLike the winter solstice, when bamboo and trees wither, aiding yang’s ascent, the wise traveler conceals himself deeply. Follow the seasons, seal your mouth, and refrain from discoursing on the Dao—its vastness is boundless, its profundity formless, its emptiness beyond perception. Only through restraint can errors and failures be dispelled, lest words rebound to one’s own harm.\n\nI now distinguish these Four Symbols to enlighten later generations, who might otherwise remain blind. This chapter mends omissions while preserving oral secrets, veiled yet present. Those who annotate this should grasp the intent behind \"capturing the unicorn.\" Moreover, the admonitions—*\"Seal your mouth, refrain from discourse\"* and *\"Words rebound to one’s own harm\"*—double the clarity, extending its meaning far indeed.\n\nThis scripture grants great liberation and great spiritual power. Whoever hears it will be unharmed by serpents or tigers; whoever recites it will be untouched by plague or dysentery; whoever understands it will not be bound by hell; whoever practices it will find heaven’s bliss. Where this scripture resides, golden light constantly crisscrosses the void, and empty chambers grow bright. Those who witness it gain longevity—six times six [years]. To venerate and believe in it brings boundless blessings; how much more so for those who cultivate it diligently?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Five: Self-Narrative and Introduction to Later Chapters**\n\nI, a humble rustic dwelling in a secluded valley, cling to simplicity and disdain worldly glory. Sheltered in obscurity, I disregard fame and profit, holding fast to tranquility, seeking peace in quietude. Thus, I composed this text, singing of the *Book of Changes* and the Three Sages’ bequeathed words. Examining its intent, I find unity in shared discourse, striving to align with principle, illuminating the spirit so that its transformations flow freely, bringing harmony to the four seas and setting an example for ten thousand generations to follow.\n\nTo govern, one must first cultivate the inner self, nurturing nature through the Yellow Emperor and Laozi’s natural Way, embodying profound virtue, returning to the root, and reverting to the origin—all near at heart, never apart from oneself. Embrace the One without deviation, and longevity is assured. Combine this with the ingestion of [elixirs]: male and female [principles], the expulsion of Wudu’s eight minerals, and the rejection of common treasures. Three methods branch from one source, bearing different names yet emerging from the same gate. This is no mere accumulation of parallel phrases; this text holds truth. Let those who spread falsehoods be shamed by their excesses.\n\nI entitle this the *Cantong Qi*, though its opening is modest in words, its meaning vast. Later generations should heed its teachings, cast off harm, and rely on the mountains’ steadfastness, wandering the vast expanse as neighbors to immortals. Transforming into a transcendent, one dissolves into silence, yet even a hundred generations hence, they will roam the human realm, spreading their wings east and west, south and north. Though they encounter calamities—drought, flood, or famine—while others’ branches wither and their glory fades, the virtuous ride in safety, secure in their path to long life.\n\nMaster Shangyang further expounded this meaning in verse:\n\n*Secure in long life, long life without kalpas,*\n*The Great Dao is hard to fathom—how could the Returned Elixir change?*\n*Fire refines gold into body, earth overcomes water to form the sphere.*\n*First subduing sixteen ounces, swallowing the upper and lower [essences],*\n*Paired with ingested elixirs, returning to the root and original state.*\n*Herbs and trees differ in kind; metals and stones are cast aside.*\n*Discern their use, peer into creation—what the world treasures is this lead,*\n*Pure and refined. Through diligent cultivation,*\n*One naturally attains the sages’ treasure.*\n\nThe *Golden Scripture* accumulates merit and forges karmic bonds. Refining the primordial, the Most High commands: *\"Extend the sharp blade, towering high, nurturing the imperial within the Mysterious Pass. The Niwan Palace radiates divine brilliance, crimson and resplendent, covering the Eight Heavens. The Great Luo aligns with the Jade Capital. The cinnabar phoenix wheels in flight, its sacred chapters resounding through the Nine Capitals. Demons bow in repentance, sprinkled with willow-branch nectar. Expounding the true canon, the luminous spirit spreads the primordial chant. Kalpa after kalpa, the golden mouth proclaims: recite once to heal deep ailments; seven to nine times to reverse heaven and earth; a hundred to a thousand times to present your name before the Jade Emperor. Ten thousand recitations without cease—from fire blooms the golden lotus. The people transcend the formless realm; you, sir, ferry across the great thousand. Golden youths scatter celestial blossoms; jade maidens hold jeweled feasts. Divine winds echo through layered skies; Brahma’s voice fills the immortal fields. The Five Elders diligently record the registers; the Four Assistants compare the imperial chapters. Rosy clouds and feathered canopies drift in the Great Clarity; purple mists float above the boundless Dragon Han. Assessing merits, their luster gleams like jade, spanning billions of kalpas. Golden light blazes across ten thousand heavens; the Nine Yangs ascend the Mysterious Peak’s lofty transcendent.\"*\n\n**The Zhouyi Cantong Qi, with Chapter Divisions and Annotations, Volume Three**",

      "translated_text": "The Imperially Commissioned *Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n*Masters Section, Volume 14*\n*Annotated Chapters of the* Zhouyi Cantong Qi\n*Daoist Category* · *Abstract*\n\n**[We, your] ministers respectfully note:**\n\nThe *Annotated Chapters of the Zhouyi Cantong Qi* in three juan was composed by Chen Zhixu of the Yuan dynasty. Zhixu, styled Guanwu and self-styled Shangyangzi, began studying the Dao under Zhao Youqin at the age of forty, delving into the arts of divine transcendents and alchemical cultivation. His teachings held that the Way of the Golden Elixir should take the *Yin Fu Jing* and the *Daode Jing* as its foundation, with the *Jinbi Cantong* and *Cantong Qi* as secondary. He further asserted that while many alchemical texts were untrustworthy, those seeking true oral instructions must rely primarily on the *Cantong Qi* and the *Wuzhen Pian*. In his *Poem to Awaken the Eye*, he wrote:\n\n*\"Truly, there exists a formula for long life and immortality—*\n*Yet common folk, their virtue shallow, how could they receive it?*\n*Lead, silver, cinnabar, mercury—each weighed in ounces;*\n*Only with profound power and deep grace did Wei Boyang compose his work.\"*\n\nThus, it is evident that Boyang’s text was his particular object of study.\n\nThis work, his commentary on the *Cantong Qi*, divides the text into thirty-five chapters, differing from Peng Xiao’s edition, which divides it into ninety. He also criticized Xiao for relocating the *\"Song of the Cauldron\"* to the end as improper, instead adhering to the original arrangement by placing it after the *\"Completion of the Symbolic Achievement\"* chapter. His annotations are clear, lucid, and accessible.\n\nRecently, Li Guangdi’s commentary on the *Cantong Qi* has stated that among all versions, the one included in the *Han-Wei Congshu* under Zhu Changchun’s name most closely preserves the ancient intent. Upon collating this with Zhu’s edition, we find that only the opening passage—*\"Qian and Kun are the gate and door of the Changes\"*—lacks chapter titles. Thus, from *\"Qian and Kun Establish Their Positions\"* onward, it is divided into thirty-four chapters, one fewer than this edition. The remaining chapter sequences, however, align entirely with this text. It appears that Zhu’s edition is merely a transcription of this work with its annotations removed, though Guangdi failed to trace its origins.\n\nRespectfully submitted in the third month of the forty-fourth year of the Qianlong reign.\n*Chief Compilers:*\n*Minister* Ji Yun\n*Minister* Lu Xixiong\n*Minister* Sun Shiyi",

Kan and Li form the encompassing frame, the wheel’s hub and true axle. The four hexagrams of Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li serve as the bellows and key, covering and veiling the Dao of yin and yang—just as a craftsman or charioteer relies on the marking cord, holds the bit and reins, aligns the compass and square, and follows the wheel tracks, abiding in the center to govern the exterior.\n\nNumbers are recorded in the pitch-pipes and calendars; the lunar phases have five or six days. The warp and weft attend the sun, combining to form sixty. Hard and soft have their outer and inner aspects. At dawn, *Zhun* governs affairs; by dusk, *Meng* takes its turn. Day and night each correspond to one hexagram, applied in sequence. Before the month’s end, at the break of dawn, the cycle renews. The sun and moon set the measure; movement and stillness have their early and late phases. Spring and summer occupy the inner body, from *Zi* to *Chen* and *Si*; autumn and winter serve the outer function, from *Wu* to *Xu* and *Hai*. Rewards and punishments respond to spring and autumn; darkness and light follow cold and heat. The line statements embody benevolence and righteousness, issuing joy and anger in accord with the seasons. Thus they correspond to the four seasons and five phases, attaining their principle.\n\nFu Xi beheld the *Hetu* and first drew the eight trigrams. The Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun let their robes hang loose, and the world was ordered—taking Qian and Kun as their model. The *Guicang* of the Xia dynasty made Kun the first; the *Lianshan* of the Shang called Gen the first. The *Zhouyi* of King Wen placed Qian and Kun first. Confucius’ *Wings* says: “Are not Qian and Kun the gate and door of the Changes?” Qian is the yang thing; Kun is the yin thing. It further states: “Qian, in stillness, is concentrated; in movement, it is straight—thus it greatly engenders. Kun, in stillness, is closed; in movement, it opens—thus it broadly engenders.”",

      "translated_text": "Master Boyang, the Transcendent, deeply grasped the precautions of the Three Sages and composed the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, the supreme wing of the Three Sages’ Dao, guiding the people of myriad generations. Its opening lines directly point: “Qian and Kun are the gate and door of the Changes, the father and mother of all hexagrams.” Master Shangyang said: “Qian, as a thing, is yang—thus it is the door of the Changes. Kun, as a thing, is yin—thus it is the gate of the Changes.” Without the gate and door of Qian and Kun, how could Heaven and Earth establish their positions? How could the sun and moon radiate their light? How could creatures transform and be born? How could the sage enact his Dao?\n\nThus, when Qian moves and straightens, yang arises from the Supreme Ultimate and generates yin. When Kun moves and opens, yin arises from the Supreme Ultimate and generates yang. Yin and yang intertwine to form Li and Kan. Confucius said: “The Changes possess the Supreme Ultimate, which generates the Two Modes. The Two Modes generate the Four Images, and the Four Images generate the eight trigrams.” The function of Qian is nine: first riding Kun to form *Fu*; within *Fu*, *Zhen* is conceived; from *Fu* emerges *Shi*; within *Shi*, *Kan* is conceived; from *Shi* emerges *Qian*; within *Qian*, *Gen* is conceived; from *Qian* emerges *Yu*. *Zhen* is born of *Yu*; *Bi* arises from *Yu*; *Kan* is born of *Bi*; *Bo* arises from *Bi*; *Gen* is born of *Bo*. Thus, the three sons—*Zhen*, *Kan*, and *Gen*—are all conceived within Kun.\n\nThe function of Kun is six: first riding Qian to form *Gou*; within *Gou*, *Pi* is conceived; from *Gou* emerges *Tongren*; within *Tongren*, *Li* is conceived; from *Tongren* emerges *Lü*; within *Lü*, *Dui* is conceived; from *Lü* emerges *Xiaoxu*. *Xiaoxu* gives rise to *Pi*; *Pi* gives rise to *Dayou*; *Dayou* gives rise to *Li*; *Dayou* gives rise to *Guai*. Thus, the three daughters—*Pi*, *Li*, and *Dui*—are all conceived within Qian. Male and female intermingle, mutually relying on one another. When Qian twice joins Kun, *Lin* is formed; from *Lin* emerges *Tai*; from *Tai* emerges *Dazhuang*; from *Dazhuang* emerges *Guai*—this is yang seeking yin. When Kun twice responds to Qian, *Dun* is formed; from *Dun* emerges *Pi*; from *Pi* emerges *Guan*; from *Guan* emerges *Bo*—this is yin responding to yang. This is how Qian generates the three daughters and the three sons. From this point onward, the three sons and three daughters alternately become husband and wife, and the sixty-four hexagrams emerge in sequence. This is what is meant by Qian and Kun being the father and mother of all hexagrams.\n\nWhat is meant by Kan and Li being the frame and enclosure? When yang rides yin, Qian’s center becomes empty and forms Li. When yin rides yang, Kun’s belly becomes full and forms Kan. Thus, Kan and Li succeed the body of Qian and Kun, serving as the frame and enclosure of yin and yang. Their relation to Qian and Kun is like the spokes of a wheel to its hub and axle: Qian and Kun are the true spokes of Kan and Li, while Kan and Li converge at the hub of Qian and Kun. Laozi said: “Thirty spokes share one hub.” This is the same principle as the great and small precautions of Boyang.\n\nThe female and male: the female is the mother of creatures, the male the father of creatures. Thus, the female is the general term for yin things, the male the general name for yang things. Together, Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li are called the four hexagrams of female and male. They serve as the bellows and key, employing yin and yang to bring about growth and decline. The bellows symbolizes the gate of yin and the door of yang, likening Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li to a single bellows and key within Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe Dao of the bellows and key that generates creatures is called *wu*; the Dao of the bellows and key that generates humans is called *ren*; the Dao of the bellows and key that transcends the ordinary and enters sagehood is called *sheng*. The sage is one who skillfully seizes the transformations of creation, skillfully employs Kan and Li. One who skillfully seizes the Dao of creation is like a master craftsman using the inked cord and square to correct the compass—what task cannot be accomplished? One who skillfully employs the Dao of Kan and Li is like holding the reins and bit to follow the wheel tracks—where can one not arrive? The sage holds the cosmos in his hands and gives birth to the myriad transformations within his body.",

The *Zhouyi* of King Wen placed Qian and Kun first. Confucius’ *Wings* says: “Are not Qian and Kun the gate and door of the Changes?” Qian is the yang thing; Kun is the yin thing. It further states: “Qian, in stillness, is concentrated; in movement, it is straight—thus it greatly engenders. Kun, in stillness, is closed; in movement, it opens—thus it broadly engenders.”",

      "translated_text": "The sage excels at abiding in the center to govern the external, illuminating the pitch-pipes and calendrical reckoning to comprehend the numerical patterns. The pitch-pipes respond to the seasonal indications of creation, while the calendar records the revolutions of the celestial sphere. When the first yang arises, the pitch-pipes resonate with the Yellow Bell; from *zi* to *hai*, the celestial degrees complete their cycle, and thus a year is fulfilled as yang is reborn at *zi*. The lunar nodes comprise five or six: the lunar nodes divide two nodes per month, five days make one *hou* (seasonal marker), and six *hou* constitute a month—hence a month has thirty days. A day has twelve hours, and two hexagrams with twelve lines correspond to a day’s warp and weft; a month has sixty hexagrams, forming its inner and outer patterns.\n\nAt the new moon’s dawn, *Zhun* governs affairs, and by dusk, *Meng* assumes reception—why is this? *Zhen* below and *Kan* above form *Zhun*; *Zhen* is the eldest son, capable of reviving the yang within *Kan* to bestow the power of generation, hence *Zhun* governs affairs. *Gen* above and *Kan* below form *Meng*; *Gen* is the youngest son, capable of gathering the yang within *Kan* to enact the function of nurturing warmth, hence *Meng* assumes reception. Day and night each correspond to one hexagram; within the sixty hexagrams, yin and yang mutually bestow generation and nurturance. The dark and new moons mark the beginning and end of a month; morning and evening regulate a day’s movement and stillness. The four seasons determine a year’s rewards and punishments: those who achieve excellence are rewarded, while those who fail in their tasks are punished—never deviating from the proper balance of benevolence, righteousness, joy, and anger. The essential principle of this chapter broadly outlines the unifying thread of the *Cantong Qi*, designating Qian and Kun as the gateways of the *Yi*. It does not merely speak of the elixir, medicinal substances, or firing times.\n\nThis book has been annotated by over a hundred scholars, yet few have deeply penetrated its mysteries. Only Peng Xiao, the True Unity Master, though familiar with the firing process, lacked proper sequence, interpreting each chapter as medicinal substances and firing times, every passage as alchemical crucible work. Some fear later generations may misconstrue it, yet how could the Immortal Elder’s composition contain redundant language? The upper chapter narrates the transformations of yin and yang, refining the Great Elixir; the middle chapter meticulously discusses the return, nurturing, and precautions; the lower chapter models the symbolic forms to reveal the details of elixir completion. The upper chapter proceeds in sequence, while the middle chapter arranges its principles in order—how could they be confused and unexamined?\n\nMaster Shangyang divided and annotated it: the upper chapter into fifteen sections, corresponding to the upper *gua*’s attainment of the elixir; the middle chapter into fifteen sections, corresponding to the lower *gua*’s completion of the elixir; the lower chapter into five sections, corresponding to the completion number of the Five Phases. The divisions of chapters group those with shared intent into single chapters. Following the Immortal Elder’s original intent, the sequence unfolds, borrowing esoteric language to directly point to the elixir’s medicinal substances, firing, crucible, and the four mysteries of creation, enabling later generations to readily grasp and practice, ascending from the ordinary to sagehood, becoming buddhas and immortals. Yet the secrets transmitted heart-to-heart and mouth-to-mouth dare not be committed to writing.\n\nAlas! The virtue and capacity of worldly people are shallow, and slander easily arises. Thus, the ancient sages and great worthies established teachings and transmitted instructions without divulging celestial treasures, scattering them within the classics. King Wen and Confucius mutually affirmed, “The *Zhouyi* clarifies this Dao.” The Yellow Emperor and Laozi mutually affirmed, “The Golden Elixir clarifies this Dao.” Śākyamuni and Bodhidharma mutually affirmed, “The Great Vehicle clarifies this Dao.” The sages, with compassion and skillful means, guide and lead, desiring all to comprehend this Dao—truly the ladder for sentient beings, the bridge for ten thousand generations. How could later people, each clinging to differing views, fail to establish resolute aspiration and seek true teachers, remaining ignorant of yin-yang’s mutual resonance and mutual assistance, each prizing their own hearsay, straying ever further?\n\nThose who see the *Zhouyi* deem it a book of divination and *na jia*, how could they know the Dao of mutual resonance and attaining companionship? Those who encounter discussions of crucibles guess it concerns metallurgy and furnace fires; those who hear of gathering and harvesting guess it refers to the Three Peaks’ sexual arts. Those who hear of effort suspect heterodox paths; those who hear of non-effort suspect sitting in dull emptiness. Those who hear of the Great Vehicle cling to Chan’s empty nature, merely engaging in discourse without examining the sage’s Dao—using yin and yang to cultivate beyond yin and yang, employing worldly methods to cultivate beyond the worldly.\n\nHow could such people discuss the wondrous words within the *Cantong Qi*? Formerly, Wang Chongxi received the Golden Elixir’s instructions from Liu Haichan and attained the Dao, sighing, “No one in the world understands this—only Zhang Pingshu alone.” Pingshu encountered a sagely teacher in Chengdu and composed the *Wuzhen Pian* to instruct later generations, its esoteric language and profound words entirely congruent with the *Cantong Qi*. Master Shangyang, after meeting his sagely teacher, extensively traveled rivers and lakes, broadly seeking and widely gathering—yet all were slanderous talks. The *Cuixu Pian* states: “Later generations still go to study Chan, exposing countless wild fox spirits.” Nowadays, not even one like Pingshu remains—where could one find someone like Chongxi? Yet those who discourse on Chan and nature, flaunting dry wisdom, are everywhere; those who can enter this gate and hear the sage’s Dao are one in a hundred million. Thus, Chongxi’s words reveal great awakening, while Cuixu’s language is pitiable.\n\nThe ancients said: “Those who discuss the Dao are like ox hairs; those who comprehend the Dao are like rabbit horns.” How much rarer are those who practice it? The former worthies said: “Fools do not understand; upon hearing, they greatly clamor. The superior person’s mind is clear; upon hearing, they know the crux.” If one were to ask what this crux is and compare it to the gate of yin and yang, would this not further provoke their猜疑?\n\n**Chapter Two: Qian and Kun Establish Their Positions**\nHeaven and Earth establish their positions, and the *Yi* operates within them. Heaven and Earth are the images of Qian and Kun; establishing positions refers to arranging the positions of yin and yang in mutual pairing. The *Yi* refers to Kan and Li. Kan and Li are the two functions of Qian and Kun. The two functions, without fixed line positions, circulate through the six voids, coming and going without constancy, neither above nor below, ever abiding. Hidden and concealed, they transform within, enveloping the myriad things, serving as the guiding principles of the Dao. Using the insubstantial to regulate the substantial, the utensils employ emptiness. Thus, Kan and Li’s arising and vanishing are not carelessly created; their theories are not idly generated. Drawing evidence, verifying effects, measuring spiritual clarity, and tracing the origins of characters serve as proof.\n\nKan corresponds to *wu* (earth) and the moon’s essence; Li corresponds to *si* (fire) and the sun’s light. The sun and moon are the *Yi*; hardness and softness are balanced. Earth flourishes in the four seasons, weaving through beginnings and ends. Blue, red, black, and white each reside in their directions, all receiving the function of the central palace’s *wu* and *si*.",

      "translated_text": "The *Ten Wings*’ *Appended Judgments* states: \"Heaven is noble, earth is base; Qian and Kun are thus established.\" The Immortal Elder expounds: \"Heaven and earth set their positions, and the *Yi* operates within them.\" Further annotation says: \"Heaven and earth are the images of Qian and Kun. Setting positions means arranging the positions of yin and yang in harmonious pairing.\" The *Yi* speaks of Kan and Li: Kan and Li are the two functions of Qian and Kun. Though their words are detailed and their intent earnest, how could they expect the world to believe so readily, when fools struggle to comprehend?\n\nThe *Wings* say: \"Dividing yin, dividing yang, alternating softness and hardness—thus the *Yi*’s six positions form a pattern.\" The two functions: Qian employs nine, Kun employs six. There is function but no fixed position. \"Employing nine, one sees a flock of dragons without a leader—auspicious,\" for the noble person practices the Way until virtue reaches its utmost. \"Employing six, it is beneficial to perpetually uphold correctness,\" for Kun’s virtue is the Way of earth, the Way of the wife, the Way of the minister. The Way of earth achieves nothing yet perpetually brings things to completion. Thus, Kun’s function, being solitary yin, accomplishes nothing; only by employing six in accord with Qian does it proceed with the *Yi*’s movement. Qian employing nine matches Kun: \"In the southwest, one gains companions.\" Qian and Kun transform, each rectifying its nature and destiny. Qian’s great beginning, employing nine, rides Kun’s yang, containing its yin emptiness to form Li. Kun’s Great Unity, employing six, bears Qian’s yin, containing its yang fullness to form Kan. Thus, Kan and Li exclusively embody yin and yang in their forms, transforming in function to envelop and nurture life without cease. Like the sun and moon in the sky, swiftly waxing and waning, swiftly cycling through new and full moons; like the yin and yang in the human body, swiftly becoming the Supreme Polarity, swiftly shifting without constancy—the Way of the *Yi* repeatedly changes, never abiding. If Qian and Kun were destroyed, there would be no means to perceive the *Yi*. The sage purifies his heart, retreats, and conceals himself in secrecy, thereby reversing the course of the *Yi*’s Way.\n\nKing Wen’s *Zhouyi* has six lines per hexagram, hence \"six positions form a pattern.\" It also says: \"They flow through the six voids.\" Their coming and going, waxing and waning, are not fixed; their rising and falling, fullness and emptiness, are also without constancy. Thus, Qian initially changes to *Gou*, and through successive changes reaches Kun; Kun initially changes to *Fu*, and through successive changes reaches *Guai*. There are also three sons and three daughters mutually interchanging. Moreover, all sixty hexagrams undergo successive changes, with each hexagram—including the wandering and returning souls—transforming through eight trigrams. There are also cumulative changes, where one hexagram accumulates changes to reach sixty-four hexagrams, and sixty-four hexagrams accumulate changes to reach four thousand ninety-six hexagrams, which then mutually conceive and gestate, each receiving yin and yang to become the ceaseless flux of the world. All this is the Way of yin and yang.\n\nThis qi of the yin-yang Way may lie hidden within the body, or conceal itself within the various forms; it may transform within, enveloping the myriad things, or vigorously enact generation and destruction as the guiding principles of the Dao. Were it not for Qian and Kun’s two functions as the wondrous guiding principles of the Dao, the Dao might well cease to exist. \"Using the insubstantial to regulate the substantial, the utensils employ emptiness.\" Why are \"insubstantial\" and \"substantial\" two distinct things? The division of the Supreme Polarity gives rise to prior Heaven and posterior Heaven. What is prior Heaven? That which is above form is called the Dao, entering the insubstantial from the substantial. What is posterior Heaven? That which is below form is called the utensil, entering the substantial from the insubstantial. Laozi said: \"The nameless is the beginning of Heaven and earth; the named is the mother of the myriad things.\" Hai Chan said: \"From insubstantial to substantial, all are thus; from substantial to insubstantial, how few can achieve it!\" Measuring the functions of Kan and Li’s waxing and waning, posterior Heaven is all utensils—forms, dregs, and substances that wax and wane, arise and vanish. Only prior Heaven possesses the enduring Dao, enabling one to ascend to sagehood.\n\nConfucius said: \"Prior to Heaven, Heaven does not oppose it; posterior to Heaven, it follows Heaven’s timing.\" Ordinary people merely follow the posterior Heaven’s Way, hence they are born and die in endless cycles. The sage skillfully reverses and employs the prior Heaven’s Way, thus attaining knowledge, investigating things, rectifying the heart, and cultivating the self, thereby enduring forever without extinction. \"Counting what has passed follows the sequence; knowing what is to come reverses it\"—thus the Way of the *Yi* is the art of reversal.\n\n\"Words are not carelessly created\": The books of the various masters and hundred schools are composed according to their talents—how could they all be skillful? This is the ancestral book of the Dao; one cannot casually insert a single word for fear of misleading later generations. This is what is meant by \"words are not carelessly created.\" \"Theories are not idly generated\": The Immortal Elder models himself on the Three Sages, aligning with yin and yang and emulating the sun and moon. Moreover, he composed this book in concert with the *Yi* as a ladder and raft for the world. This is what is meant by \"theories are not idly generated.\"\n\nWhat is \"drawing evidence, verifying effects\"? Formerly, the Yellow Emperor ascended to immortality; Chao Fu and Xu You attained transcendence; Laozi transformed the Hu and became a Buddha; in Huainan, even the chickens and dogs became immortals. These are all examples of \"drawing evidence, verifying effects.\" What is \"measuring spiritual clarity\"? Like the sun and moon conjoining in splendor, manifesting on the *gengzi* day—\"spiritual and enlightened, it depends on the person.\" What is \"tracing the origins of characters\"? Like cinnabar being born from the moon, the water trigram Kan; the sun and moon forming the character *yi* at the beginning of the Dao’s completion—this is \"tracing the origins of characters.\" What is \"serving as proof\"? Yin reaches its extreme and becomes yang; yang reaches its extreme and becomes yin. Following yin and yang generates humans and things; reversing and employing yin and yang must produce the yin elixir—this is the \"proof.\"\n\n\"Kan corresponds to *wu* (earth) and the moon’s essence\": The north’s proper position is Kan, which contains true earth—this is the yang earth. The Female constellation governs affairs, concealing the yang essence. *Wu* is its gate; the moon’s hub is its abode. Within, it hides the hornless hare—white inside, black outside—making it yang within yin, outwardly feminine yet inwardly masculine. \"Li corresponds to *si* (fire) and the sun’s light\": The south’s proper position is Li, which contains true earth—this is the yin earth. The Willow constellation governs affairs, concealing the yin light. *Si* is its door; the sun’s wheel is its repository. Within, it hides the three-legged crow—black inside, white outside—making it yin within yang, inwardly feminine yet outwardly masculine.\n\nThe ancients used the sun and moon to form the character *yi*, for *yi* is precisely yin and yang. Yet when one speaks of yin and yang, one does not see *yi*; when one speaks of *yi*, one does not see yin and yang. Moreover, without earth, the myriad things cannot sprout and grow, and the sun and moon especially rely on earth to gestate. Thus, when the sun moves east, it passes through the Di earth; when it moves west, it passes through the Stomach earth; when it travels south, it passes through the Willow earth; when it nurtures in the north, it passes through the Female earth. The sun and moon, receiving earth, endure in their brightness; earth, borrowing the sun and moon, deepens its virtue. Earth’s dominion cycles through the four seasons: spring’s generation, summer’s growth—these are earth’s functions; autumn’s gathering, winter’s closure—these are earth’s powers. Thus, each of the four seasons has its ruling days, and earth long abides in the central palace, weaving through beginnings and ends to fulfill its work. Though blue, red, black, and white each reside in the east, west, south, and north, they all receive the power of *wu* and *si*, the two sevens, to jointly perfect their virtue and enact spiritual transformations.\n\nThis chapter speaks of yin and yang dividing their positions and each residing in its function, necessarily relying on earth. It contains no discourse on tiger, dragon, lead, mercury, metal, water, or the gathering of medicinal herbs. Thus, earlier it speaks of \"arranging yin and yang in harmonious pairing,\" and later it says \"each resides in its direction.\" Other interpretations are not recounted, for the Immortal Elder’s original intent does not involve dividing and adjusting components, causing disorder and mutual annotation, which might lead later readers of this book to say the Immortal Elder is verbose and repetitive, unaware that the wondrous words follow a sequence.",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Three: The Celestial Bodies of Sun and Moon**\n\nThe *Yi* is imagery; the most luminous of suspended images are none greater than the sun and moon. To exhaust the spirit is to know transformation: when yang departs, yin arrives, their convergence turning like spokes in a wheel, revolving in alternation, emerging and entering, coiling and unfurling. The *Yi* contains three hundred and eighty-four lines, from which hexagrams are drawn—these are the sixty-four hexagrams. From the dark of the moon to the dawn of the new moon, *Zhen* arrives to receive the tally. At this moment, heaven and earth unite their essence, sun and moon clasp and sustain each other: the male yang scatters its numinous radiance, the female yin transforms the yellow womb. Chaos intermingles, the root of power is planted, the foundation laid, nurturing and enclosing, congealing spirit to form the body. All beings tread forth, and even the slightest movement arises from this.\n\nConfucius said: \"Nothing is more vast in adaptability than the four seasons; nothing is more luminous in suspended imagery than the sun and moon.\" The Immortal Elder reiterates and elaborates upon this. This book models its principles on the sun and moon to illustrate yin and yang. The sun and moon adhere to heaven, exhibiting waxing and waning, opposition and union. Yin and yang in the world manifest as compliance and reversal, generation and completion. The sun is the pure yang *qi*, called the Great Yang; the moon is the pure yin essence, called the Great Yin. The celestial sphere spans three hundred and sixty-five degrees and a quarter. Each day and night, heaven completes one revolution, constituting a single day. The Great Yang traverses one degree per day, covering thirty degrees in a month. The Great Yin moves thirteen degrees and a fraction daily, completing one revolution in a month. The sun’s movement of one degree defines a day.\n\nWhat does it mean to \"exhaust the spirit to know transformation\"? Of all spirits, none surpass heaven and earth; of all transformations, none surpass yin and yang. The Dao of heaven revolves leftward, completing one circuit daily, traversing over five hundred and fifty thousand *li*. Earth rests within its *qi*, motionless like a plank floating upon water. The spirit of the Great Yang is the primordial *qi* of heaven and earth. Its body is wholly radiant, and the ten thousand things rely upon its fiery yang *qi*—flaming and red—to grow, mature, and bear fruit. Its diameter spans eight hundred and forty-five *li* with a slight remainder. Its path does not follow the ecliptic or celestial equator but moves within and beyond the ecliptic: when days lengthen, it lies north of the celestial equator; when days shorten, it lies south. Why speak of north and south, inner and outer? Because the Purple Forbidden Enclosure, where the Emperor’s seat resides, lies in the north—thus the north is called \"inner,\" and the south \"outer.\" Its spirit is inexhaustible: such is the spirit of the Great Yang.\n\nThe spirit of the Great Yin is the supreme essence of heaven and earth. Its body is wholly dark, and the ten thousand things rely upon its watery yin transformation to conceive, produce, nourish, and nurture. Its diameter spans six hundred and seventy *li* with a slight remainder. Its path does not follow the ecliptic or celestial equator. The ecliptic and celestial equator resemble two intersecting rings, separated by twenty-four degrees. The moon moves through their midst, deviating from the ecliptic by approximately six degrees. Though its body is dark, it brightens when illuminated by the sun. This is likened to a black lacquered ball hung beneath the eaves: when sunlight strikes it, the ball reflects light onto a distant shadowed wall. The moon’s spherical form, compared to the black lacquered ball, shines where the sun touches it and remains dark where it does not. Thus, it is always half-illuminated and half-obscured. At the full moon, sun and moon oppose each other: at night, the moon is above, the sun below, and the moon’s fully illuminated side faces the world, while its dark side turns toward heaven, unseen by mortals. At the new moon, sun and moon share the same celestial longitude. When the moon waxes, it lies beneath the sun, receiving its light: one side shines toward heaven, the other darkens toward earth. When the moon separates from the sun by twenty-five degrees, its faint glow begins to appear to humanity. As the distance increases, its light grows. When the moon is ninety degrees from the sun, half its light is visible—this is called the first quarter. After the full moon, its light gradually diminishes.\n\nThus, the moon’s body is not inherently round or crescent; it depends on the amount of sunlight it receives. Foolish people may claim that at opposition, the earth obstructs the sun and moon, unaware of the vast height of heaven and the principle that yin and yang *qi* interpenetrate without obstruction. The apparent blemishes in the moon are the shadows of heaven and earth. The sun’s body is large, the moon’s small; the sun is distant from heaven, the moon even more so. Yet the moon’s transformations cannot be fully revealed: such is the spirit of the Great Yin.\n\nThis is what it means to \"exhaust the spirit to know transformation.\" *Zi* is the first of the yang stems, reaching its zenith at *Si*, where yang is extreme and yin begins to arise. *Wu* is the first of the yin stems, reaching its zenith at *Hai*, where yin is extreme and yang begins to arise. Cold and heat alternate, warmth and coolness balance. When yin is at its peak, yang is born; when yang departs, yin arrives. Yin clings to yang as spokes to a wheel, converging and turning. When yin coils, yang unfurls. The *Yi* contains three hundred and eighty-four lines, from which hexagrams are drawn. Each hexagram has six lines, each line three tally-marks. A day comprises two hexagrams, totaling thirty-six tally-marks. Yin and yang intersect not in the span of a single hour, nor do they exhaust the function of a single line. Within an hour, three tally-marks exist, yet only one is employed. The use of a single tally-mark signifies the birth of one yang beneath *Kun*, forming *Zhen*—*Zhen* being one yang that subdues two yins.\n\nThus it is said: \"*Zhen* arrives to receive the tally.\" At this moment, heaven and earth unite their essence, and the ten thousand things, suspended in emptiness, receive life. Sun and moon clasp and sustain each other, the crow and hare intertwined without release. Yang stands firm and masculine, scattering its numinous radiance; yin opens and feminine, transforming the yellow womb to contain and nurture. In the depths of chaos, the two intermingle, the root of power planted, the foundation of the primordial union laid. *Quan* signifies the beginning, *yu* stability. The ancients crafted scales beginning with the *quan* (weight), and carts beginning with the *yu* (chassis). Here, it speaks of the inception of creation. Moreover, *quan* means \"temporary,\" and *yu* means \"stable.\"",

      "translated_text": "Here the text speaks of temporary function requiring utmost stability without rigidity or collapse. It describes the nurturing of the *yin*-*yang* boundary, the congealing of yang essence to form the bodily frame—this passage merely addresses the initial division of the Great Ultimate, the inception of yin-yang’s harmonious flow, and the birth of humanity and the ten thousand things. Thus it states: \"The multitude tread forth, and all that wriggles and moves arises therefrom.\" Yet people fail to recognize that the postcelestial sequence of yin-yang also draws from the metaphor of morning *tun* and evening *meng*, and likewise possesses the root-boundary foundation of *yin* and *yang*. They mistakenly apply this to the elixir crucible’s alchemical workings.\n\nIn the fourth chapter, \"The Sage Observes Above,\" Confucius praises the vast and empty virtue of Primordial Chaos and the Qian-Kun dyad. He traces antiquity back to the era of the Primordial Sovereign, when the *Guanju* first established the rites of cap and marriage, and qi intertwined to sprout the first germ. The sage does not arise in vain—his \"Observing Above\" reveals the celestial tally. The celestial tally advances and retreats, flexes and extends in accord with the seasons. Thus the *Book of Changes* unites with the heart of heaven: the *Fu* hexagram inaugurates the beginning, the sprouting of the eldest son, the *zong* inheriting the father’s body and establishing its foundation through the mother. The waxing and waning respond to the pitch pipes; the rising and falling follow the pivot of the Dipper. On the third day, dawn breaks as *Zhen* receives *geng* from the west; on the eighth day, *Dui* receives *ding*, and the upper *kan* levels like a taut cord. By the fifteenth day, the stem-body reaches fullness as *jia* in the east—the toad and hare, the sun and moon, their essences paired in radiant duality. The toad gazes upon the hexagram’s nodes; the hare spits forth its luminous qi. The seven-and-eight Dao now complete, the path curves downward. On the sixteenth day, the cycle turns as *kun* receives the tally from *xin*, and dawn’s clarity appears. *Gen* aligns with *bing* in the south; by the twenty-third day, the lower *kan* descends. On the thirtieth day, *kun* and *yi* in the northeast lose their companions, the nodes exhausted, the succession passing to the *zong*-body. The dragon of *ren* and *gui* pairs with *jia* and *yi*, Qian and Kun encompassing beginning and end. Seven and eight make fifteen; nine and six likewise correspond. The four combine to make thirty—the yang essence seeks extinction, the eight trigrams arrayed, their luminaries shifting without losing the central origin. Subtle and elusive, their essence is difficult to perceive; one infers and verifies through tallying signs. In dwelling, observe their images; in modeling, imitate their forms. Establish markers as standards, divine auspices to determine fortune. Issue decrees in accord with the seasons, never missing the moment of a moving line. Above, examine the patterns of the *River Chart*; below, sequence the flows of earth’s terrain. Between them, investigate the human heart, aligning and verifying the Three Powers. In motion, follow the hexagram’s nodes; at rest, rely on the *tuan*’s words. Only when Qian and Kun’s functions are enacted throughout the world can order be achieved. [One version reads: *How could one not be cautious?* This is incorrect.]\n\nThe *Wings* state: \"In the *Book of Changes*, there is the Great Ultimate, which generates the Two Modes.\" This is Confucius’ praise of the vast and empty. The virtue of Qian and Kun is the wondrous emptiness of Primordial Chaos—the era when Pangu first opened the world—this is Confucius’ investigation of antiquity. The *Guanju* concerns the proper human relations between male and female, the primacy of husband and wife in cap and marriage. Confucius, in ordering the *Book of Songs*, placed husband and wife first to rectify the Dao of yin and yang, free from deviation. In his *Wings* to the *Book of Changes*, he placed Qian and Kun first to clarify the principle that hardness and softness must be paired. Thus the *Appended Judgments* state: \"The *Book of Changes* accords with heaven and earth, and thus can encompass the Dao of heaven and earth.\" Looking up, one observes the patterns of heaven; looking down, one examines the principles of earth. Thus one knows the causes of the hidden and manifest, traces beginnings to return to endings, and thereby understands the discourse on life and death. What is meant by \"tracing beginnings\"? It is to follow the sequence of yin and yang’s Dao to generate human and thing—hence it is said: \"Cap and marriage intertwine qi.\" This is called \"knowing life.\" What is meant by \"returning to endings\"? It is to reverse the flow of the precelestial Dao, transcending the ordinary to enter sagehood—hence it is said: \"The first germ now sprouts.\" This is called \"knowing death.\"",

      "translated_text": "In ancient times, Zilu asked about death. The Master said, \"Not yet understanding life, how can one understand death?\" The sage delights in inquiry and discernment, lamenting that Zilu at that moment did not further pursue the discourse on life and death to reveal the Dao of the *Book of Changes*, thereby enabling later generations to comprehend the principle of following death and reversing life, to recognize the meaning of harmonious compliance with the Dao and virtue, and to know the Way of exhausting principle and fulfilling nature to reach destiny. Thus, when the sage descends into the world, gazing up and looking down, he meticulously examines yin and yang, taking yin as the tally and yang as the mandate.\n\nWhat is meant by \"gazing up to observe the manifest tally of heaven\"? The yin qi between heaven and earth is called the \"heavenly tally\"; the yang qi between heaven and earth is called the \"heavenly mandate.\" The yin tally within the human body is called the \"fire tally\"; the yang qi within the human body is called \"nature and life.\" When yin and yang contract and extend, the tally becomes the indicator of advance and retreat. When the tally and its indicators are precise, timing is never lost. Thus, the Dao of the *Book of Changes* is governed by the \"Heavenly Heart.\"\n\nThe \"Heavenly Heart\" is the correct position of Qian. *Zi* is the gate of the Heavenly Heart where yang is born. Qian is the yang entity; the heavenly tally is pure yin. Qian yang is initially born beneath the second yin, forming *Zhen*. *Zhen* is the eldest son. *Fu* is born from *Kun*; *Fu* is one yang concealed beneath five yins. *Kun* is the mother, hence it is said: \"By relying on the mother, the foundation is established.\"\n\nThe pitch of the bell responds to the pivot of the Dipper. The *Huangzhong* pitch is in *Zi*; the movement of the Dipper’s pivot establishes *Zi*, both corresponding to the time when the first yang begins to sprout. At the third watch of the third day, the moon’s faint yang is born in the southwest; yang is born beneath the moon in the north, hence *Zhen*. Thus, *Zhen* receives *Geng* from the west; on the eighth day, *Dui* receives *Ding*. Fire yang ascends to the midpoint, level as a plumb line. On the fifteenth day, at the full moon, the moon is in the west and the sun in the east; the moon hare fully emits its light, and yang fills the hexagram, completing *Qian*. At dawn on the sixteenth day, *Xin* appears. The yin tally envelops yang, preventing its reckless flight. On the twenty-third day, the yin tally half-encases the light, which ceases below. *Kun* receives *Yi*. On the thirtieth day, the moon’s body is complete, its brightness extinguished, pure blackness facing heaven. The northeast is the region of *Gen* and the Winnowing Basket, the abode of water. *Gen* is the path of the demon; within the human body, *Gui* fills the meridians, depleting its qi. When the tally is exhausted and *Gui* is spent, one yang revives. Thus, *Ren* and *Gui* are paired with *Jia* and *Yi*. Like *Qian* beginning with *Fu*, the numbers seven, eight, nine, and six end at twenty, completing *Kun*. True tally returns to concealment.\n\nThis reveals that the eight trigrams—*Qian* and *Kan*—reside in the north; *Gen* and *Zhen* return to the east; *Li* faces south; *Kun* and *Dui* return to the west. They interweave and array the luminaries, shifting and moving without losing the center. The center is the Heavenly Heart, the Supreme Ultimate, the primordial essence—subtle and invisible. Heaven generates the sage, who infers, measures, and verifies, using tally as evidence. Observing the images of the sun and moon, he models their forms. Like the celestial observer who erects a gnomon to use its shadow as a standard, he discerns the seasons, determines auspiciousness and inauspiciousness. At the issuance of a single decree, he must comply with the seasons. By examining the movement of lines, he knows when yang is born. Gazing up, he scrutinizes the *River Chart* to clarify the Qian image and the intersection of yin and yang. Looking down, he sequences the earth’s forms to detail the Kun body and the wondrous transformations of metal and water. Inwardly, he examines the human heart, issuing decrees in accord with the seasons, moving in accordance with the hexagrams’ nodes. *Fu* follows *Zhen* from the prior stillness; the *Tuan* commentary states: \"Great indeed is the primal power of Qian! All things owe their beginning to it. It permeates heaven.\" Clouds move, rain falls, and the myriad things flow into form. Embracing profundity, vastness, softness, and compliance, it is beneficial and steadfast. Having observed the patterns of heaven and sequenced the forms of earth, and with the human heart rectified, the gates of Qian and Kun enact the Dao of yin and yang, enabling heaven, earth, and the myriad things to attain the governance of natural order.\n\nThis chapter cites the sage’s ancient investigations and celestial observations as metaphors, illustrating the union of sun and moon, the functions of Qian and Kun, enabling the world to distinguish yin and yang, recognize advance and retreat, understand creation, model forms, respond to tally and rhythm, and carefully regulate movement and stillness. Thus, the heaven and earth within this single body are governed. It contains no discourse on drawing forth or adding to the dragon and tiger within the crucible.\n\n**Chapter Five: The Sovereign Governing the Polity**\n\nThe first step in governing the polity is to renew the old and reform the obsolete, to bind and secure the subtle and hidden, to unfold and disseminate the precious essentials. The handle of the Dipper commands transformation; the net of lines and images moves within. Auspiciousness and inauspiciousness arise externally. The five planets interweave, aligning or diverging in response to the seasons. The four and seven stars, discordant and perverse, separate and scatter. Prostrating and rising, *Wenchang* governs and records. The censors and assistants, the hundred officials and their bureaus, each oversee their respective domains. The sun harmonizes the five phases; the moon receives the six pitches. The five and six make thirty degrees; when the degrees are complete, they begin anew. Tracing beginnings and grasping endings, the threads of survival and extinction are held. If the sovereign is arrogant, dissolute, and overbearing, violating the Dao; if the minister is crafty and sycophantic, acting contrary to the proper path; if the Dipper’s handle waxes and wanes, deviating from the norm—calamity and misfortune arise. Those who enforce the law admonish and reprove, interrogating transgressions to admonish the ruler. The Pole Star receives rectitude, at ease in its position, entrusting matters to subordinates. The Bright Hall disseminates governance; the state suffers no harm to the Dao.\n\nThe Immortal Elder uses the difficulty of refining the elixir as an analogy for governing the polity, thereby revealing the difficulty of governing a disordered populace. In cultivating the elixir, one knows the difficulty of restraining the mind-horse. The old stains and vulgar impurities must all be renewed—this is the first step in governing the polity, called \"renewing the old.\" To curb anger and restrain desire, to see goodness and emulate it—this is the foundation of cultivating the self, hence \"reforming the obsolete.\"\n\nWhether governing the polity or cultivating the self, one must first begin with the most subtle and hidden aspects of oneself, binding and investigating them to achieve governance. Thus, governance is accomplished, and the self is cultivated. Confucius said, \"Governing with virtue is like the North Star: it remains in its place while the other stars pay homage.\" Virtue is not merely for governance; it is the origin of all conduct. Can the cultivator of the elixir be without virtue?\n\nWhat is virtue? Benevolence, compassion, love, clarity, and sincerity—these are the qualities of one of supreme virtue. Reverence, magnanimity, trustworthiness, diligence, and kindness—these are the gates of the human Dao.",

      "translated_text": "To cultivate the elixir, one must first prioritize kindness and diligence. Kindness suffices to employ others, and the immortal elders say: \"To unfold and bestow treasures is to externally win the people’s joy and internally preserve one’s true qi.\" This is the foremost handle of the essential Dao. If treasures are repeatedly bestowed, one can then unify and transform the guiding principles. The guiding principles are the masters of enforcing the law; when skillfully unified and transformed, those who enforce the law will not find it burdensome.\n\nWhen the inner lines of the hexagram move, fortune and misfortune externally respond—just as the five planets, in their erratic or orderly courses, correspond to fortune and misfortune in due time. The stirring and parting, the joining and shifting, share this same meaning: *chi* (誃) means to change, and *li* (離) means to move or shift.\n\nSpeaking of the twenty-eight lunar mansions in discord: when *chi* and *li* occur, all bow and rise in deference. The Literary Star governs the Supreme Subtlety as its principal star, and the *Kui* constellation, bearing its basket of six stars, is called the Southern Pole, the guiding star of the human body. It is the spirit of the Vermilion Bird, recording names in the register of longevity. The star of empty essence is the guiding discipline of the Three Terraces, and the recording star is the leader of the Three Terraces. In the human body, it governs the Hall of Light, unfolding the virtue that enlightens the world. The radiant star of the Cavernous Subtlety is the Purple Tenuity’s assistant and minister—namely, the two stars revering the Emperor. In the human body, they are the spirit of the Dark Warrior. If one beholds them, one’s lifespan may reach a thousand years. The remaining hundreds of joints and myriad spirits each oversee their respective domains.\n\nThe cultivation of the elixir, a matter intimately tied to the workings of creation, is thus more difficult than governing the polity. Hence, the stars are used to illustrate the body: the days and months harmonize with the Five Phases. At *zi*, *chou*, and *yin*, the sun and moon align with the Five Stars in the north; at *mao*, *chen*, and *si*, they align in the west; at *wu*, *wei*, and *shen*, they align in the south; at *you*, *xu*, and *hai*, they align in the east.\n\nIn the time of Yao, the celestial heart was established at *zi* on the *jiachen* day, when the winter solstice occurred in the Void Mansion of the Rat. In the Han *Taichu* era, the winter solstice occurred in the Oxherd Mansion. In the Tang *Taiyan* era, it occurred in the Eastern Dipper. From the Song dynasty to the present, it has occurred in the Southern Winnowing Basket. This is called the precession of the equinoxes. Thus, when the Great Yang obtains Fire and Earth, its essence and radiance increase; when it obtains Metal and Water, its brilliance grows ever more dazzling.\n\nThe moon is governed by the six pitch-pipes: the *lü* are yang, and the *lü* are yin. One and five, one and six, combine to form three and thirty degrees, completing the cycle of the sun and moon. Hence, it is said: when the degrees are exhausted, they begin anew. The sun and moon circulate in endless return, giving rise to fullness, waning, darkness, and conjunction. The world, following the fullness, waning, darkness, and conjunction, experiences the alternation of cold and heat. People, following the alternation of cold and heat, undergo birth, aging, illness, and death. Tracing to its origin, one may attain enduring existence; grasping its end, one may avoid perishing.\n\nThe ruler is the heart; the minister is the body. The heart is the self.",

      "translated_text": "The body is but a thing. If my heart grows arrogant and overbearing, or if I become self-satisfied and overflowing, or if the body and things contend against one another, failing to follow the proper laws, then the fullness and waning of the moon will fall into disorder, its waxing and waning will bring misfortune, and those who uphold the law will reproach and interrogate their ruler.\n\nThe Celestial Pole is the Wenchang star mentioned earlier, also called the Southern Pole. The Celestial Pole moves with rectitude and vigilance, cautiously entrusting matters to those below. The Hall of Light is the platform of the ministers, who diligently enact good governance so that the state knows no discord. The state, too, is a body. When the body is at peace and its qi harmonious, the Dao is unharmed.\n\nThis chapter draws an analogy: cultivating the body and refining the elixir is like a ruler governing the state. If the state obtains the right people and enacts proper governance, the world will be at peace. If one cultivates the body, exhausts the heart, and establishes destiny, the elixir path will be accomplished. In other versions, the phrase \"the beginning of governing\" lacks the line about \"renewing the cauldron,\" and this text has long circulated in fragmented form. Later generations, unable to fathom its profound words, introduced many errors in various editions. Zhu Xi of the Huian school corrected hundreds of characters but could not perfect it entirely—without encountering a sagely teacher, it is difficult to distinguish stone from jade.\n\n**Chapter Six: Refining the Self and Establishing the Foundation**\n\nInwardly, nurture the self with tranquility and emptiness. The original text states: \"Illumine within, reflect upon the body, close its openings, and fortify the spirit-root.\" The Three Lights sink into obscurity; nurture the inner pearl. Though unseen when gazed upon, it is near and easily sought. The Yellow Center gradually opens, its principle moistening and permeating the flesh. If the beginning is correct, the end will be cultivated. The foundation is established, yet one must not cling to the One to obscure the world—none will know of it.\n\nTo nurture the self is to refine it throughout one’s life. Confucius said: \"The noble person first stabilizes the self before acting, steadies the heart before speaking, and secures relationships before making requests. The noble person cultivates these three, and thus remains whole.\" The sage’s concerns run deep, preparing for the true nature of people. Every action, word, and request—these three are the ultimate principles for entering sageliness, the essential words for nurturing the self. Treasure essence, accumulate qi, and nurture the self. Forget the heart before the mirror—this is refining the self. Constant stillness, constant responsiveness—this is refining the self. Accumulating virtue, accomplishing merit—this is refining the self. Enduring hardship in practice is called \"refining\"; mastering the practice is called \"cultivation.\" Those who refine the elixir must first refine the self, enduring hardship and forbearance to enter the chamber at the proper time. Only when the six roots are profoundly settled and the practice becomes thoroughly familiar, forgetting even what can be forgotten, can one proceed with the work.\n\nThus, the *Great Learning* states: \"The Way of great learning lies in illuminating the luminous virtue, in renewing the people, and in resting in the highest good.\" Illuminating virtue, knowing people, and resting in the highest good—this aligns precisely with refining the self. Moreover, \"Only after knowing where to rest can one be settled; only after being settled can one be tranquil; only after being tranquil can one be at peace; only after being at peace can one deliberate; only after deliberating can one attain.\" This corresponds exactly to the essentials of tranquility and emptiness. Emptiness does not mean utter voidness; the immortal master said: \"The primordial One qi emerges from emptiness.\" This is the ultimate in tranquility and emptiness.\n\nThe \"original text\" refers to seeking from the source of one’s own birth, thereby knowing that true essence and true qi are the illumination within the body. Most people are enslaved by cleverness and intelligence, depleting their spirit and qi. The great cultivator dismisses cleverness, sets aside wisdom, reflects inwardly, forgets the self externally, seals the senses to fortify the spirit-root, and nurtures the inner pearl with focused vision. Only thus can the Yellow Center open its principle, moistening the flesh. The beginning is correct—this is the work of refining the self; the end is cultivated—this is the work of approaching the furnace. The foundation is established—this exhausts the Dao of refining the self; the final step is the work of entering the chamber. The One is the self, the *wu* (戊), and the *fang* (防). This character *fang* penetrates to the heart-ground of [Laozi’s] \"Master Yang.\"\n\nConfucius said: \"My Dao is threaded through with One.\" Laozi said: \"Attaining the One, all things are complete.\" The Buddha said: \"All dharmas return to the One.\" Thus, \"Heaven engenders water through the One\"—one must know that this water is born from within the One. The One is the central line of *kan* (坎). If the One is obscured, essence gathers and spirit guards; if the One is concealed, the numinous disperses and qi scatters. If one knows the One, the cosmos lies in the palm of the hand. If one attains the One, the myriad transformations arise within the body.",

      "translated_text": "The marvel of the One cannot be understood without a master—thus it is said: \"The One is that which, when concealed, remains unknown to the world.\" It is also called \"that which none know.\" The essential method of the Immortal Elder’s elixir begins with fortifying the numinous root: refining the self to congeal spirit. \"Nurturing the child-pearl\" means accumulating essence to amass qi. Only when the work of refining the self is pure may one proceed to refine the returning elixir. Yet世人, unaware of the greatness of refining the self, rashly pursue the half-hour’s work of obtaining the medicine, hoping for success—how foolish indeed!\n\nThus the *Scripture of Purity* states: \"Inwardly observe the heart, outwardly observe the form, and from afar observe things—one sees only emptiness, nothing that is empty, nothing that empties. Emptiness being void, even the void is void; the void of void being void, there is only profound stillness, constant quiescence, quiescence without anything to be quiescent.\" To the ordinary person, this would seem the moment of great rest, of ultimate liberation. Yet why does the text proceed to speak of desire? If desire cannot arise, this is true stillness; only true stillness can respond to things. Look closely: when one has reached the point of true stillness in responding to things, one has just begun the work of *fang*. As for the art of elixir-refining, the ordinary person has not even dreamed of it.\n\nSome offer a single meal or build a single pagoda; others practice the \"Three Peaks\" arts of battle, or sit in dry meditation reciting scriptures, or engage in \"non-action,\" or make prayers and sacrifices. These may be acts of goodness, but if one calls them the practice of the Dao, one has not yet entered its gate. If the work of nurturing the self is lacking even slightly, then—as Lü Dongbin said—\"The sevenfold returning elixir lies in man, but first one must refine the self and await the time.\" The Mud-Pill Palace states: \"Without kinship in speech, the work will not be round.\" Master Ziyang said: \"If you wish to refine the ninefold cycle, first refine the self and hold the heart—only then will the sages appear in succession.\" How could one not heed this?\n\nThe Perfected of Great Emptiness, having received the instructions of Master Huangfang, followed them to Mount Wuyi and began the work. At first, in refining the self, every obstacle summoned a hundred demons. The Perfected, standing firm, declared: \"I bind and send off the demonic essences, severing the heads of the six thieves!\" Then, settling into stillness, he sat. This thought not arising, the root of craving was cut. Only afterward did he learn contemplation. This matter of refining the self demands even greater reflection.\n\nThis chapter speaks only of nurturing the self; it contains no mention of the Golden Tiger, the crucible, or the chamber. To take the Three Lights as the Yang Fire and Yin Talisman, or the Golden Embryo, is entirely mistaken.\n\n**Chapter Seven: Illuminating the Two Apertures**\n\nThe man of superior virtue acts without contrivance, not seeking through scrutiny; the man of lesser virtue acts, and his function does not cease. When the upper is closed, it is called \"being\"; when the lower is closed, it is called \"non-being.\" Non-being serves the upper; above, the numinous virtue resides within these two apertures. The method of metal and qi also depends on mutual awareness. Guard the white to preserve the black; the numinous will come of itself. The white is the essence of metal; the black is the foundation of water. Water is the pivot of the Dao; its number is named the One, the beginning of yin and yang. It contains the Yellow Sprout, the master of the Five Metals. The Northern River Chariot—thus lead is black without but holds golden radiance within. \"Clad in coarse cloth, yet bearing jade within\": outwardly a madman, metal is the mother of water, the mother nurturing the child’s embryo; water is the child of metal, the child concealed within the mother’s womb. The Perfected’s subtlety is as if present, as if absent, like the vast abyss now sinking, now rising. Retreating, they distribute and guard their respective domains. Gather the white; refine it until it becomes vermilion. The outer guards, the inner is true. Residing in a square inch, mixed yet mutually constrained, it is born before Heaven and Earth, majestic and lofty. Surrounding it are walls and gates, resembling Penglai Island, encircling and enclosing, with four passages sealed. Hesitating, one guards and defends, tightly securing to block all treachery. Curved yet interconnected, it wards against the unforeseen. One may be free from anxious thought, from wearying the spirit and qi. The chamber is full, yet nothing can remain. Those who guard it prosper; those who lose it perish. In movement and stillness, rest and activity, it is ever with man.\n\nThe man of superior virtue is one whose embodiment is complete, a scholar of \"nothing not done.\"",

      "translated_text": "When a man reaches the age of sixteen, his true essence is complete and desire arises to discharge it. The man of complete virtue can preserve and cherish it, remaining perfectly undisturbed. If he then encounters an enlightened teacher who imparts the Dao of wuwei cultivation to nurture his longevity, he becomes a scholar of \"nothing not done,\" a man of complete virtue. This is the transformation of the sage through wuwei, the accomplishment of the great man in achieving wuwei.\n\nThe man of lesser virtue is one who seizes the workings of creation, a scholar who plunders the myriad things. For all men, when they first reach sixteen, their true essence remains undischarged, called \"pure Qian.\" Yet once desire stirs, the middle line of Qian departs and enters the Kun palace, and Qian can no longer remain pure. The heart becomes empty, forming Li. Thereafter, day and night, leakage occurs—how much remains if one merely preserves it? Only the perfected man, without waiting for exhaustion, practices the sage’s way of restoring wholeness to attain immortality. This is the scholar of lesser virtue, one who seizes the workings of creation, the sage’s path of following one’s nature, the achievement of the divine man through wei.\n\nThe man of superior virtue practices wuwei yet accomplishes all things, attaining the complete body of the Great Ultimate and achieving the work of the posterior heaven. This is called \"not seeking through scrutiny.\" The man of lesser virtue practices wei and acts with purpose, seizing the function of creation to accomplish the work of the prior heaven. This is called \"its function never ceasing.\" As the immortal master said: \"It begins with action, unseen by others; only when it reaches wuwei do people recognize it. They see wuwei as essential and subtle, yet who knows that action is the foundation?\" These words exhaust the matter of the Golden Elixir—it is not easy. The perfected man acts only when compelled, as Laozi said: \"Fine weapons are inauspicious tools, used only when there is no alternative.\" This refers precisely to such a case.\n\nClosing above is called \"having\"; closing above pertains to Kun. The virtue of Kun lies in its stillness, which contracts and holds the Wu earth within Kan. Within it resides the prior-heaven true unity of qi. Closing below is called \"not having\"; closing below pertains to Qian. The virtue of Qian lies in its stillness, which concentrates emptiness and holds the Ji earth within Li. Within it is contained the posterior-heaven natural water. The two apertures are used as the Classic says: \"Constantly without desire, observe its wonders; constantly without desire, observe its apertures.\" These two emerge from the same source yet have different names; together they are called \"the mysterious, the mystery within mystery, the gate of all wonders.\" The sage has no dual mind; his mysterious words and subtle speech are never lofty or distant, yet for ten thousand generations, none can fathom their beginnings. One must receive transmission from a teacher. Even the Yellow Emperor, that supreme sage, if he had not studied under Guangchengzi, how could he have illuminated this Dao? Only thus are the apertures described. The sage can do no more to depict them. At the ultimate point, Fuxi drew the trigrams, beginning with Qian and Kun to define these apertures. King Wen later clarified them by doubling the lines, and Confucius expounded the meaning of Qian’s straightness and Kun’s openness. Laozi said: \"The gate of the mysterious female is called the root of heaven and earth.\" Śākyamuni spoke of the \"treasury of the true Dharma eye, the wondrous mind of nirvana.\" All these are direct pointers, visible to the eye.\n\nA superior scholar may be able to comprehend these apertures on his own, but their functions and workings cannot be understood without a teacher. \"Not having\" is to serve the above; \"not speaking\" is the nature of Ji. \"Having\" is the Wu earth; emotion is like the nature of Ji. If one can serve the emotion of Wu, then emotion will surely cherish the benevolence of nature.\n\nAbove resides the spiritual virtue, the prior-heaven unity of qi that comes from emptiness—this is the virtue of spirit. The immortal elder repeatedly pointed to these two apertures, saying: \"These two cavities, their methods and qi, mutually depend on each other.\" These two lines are the key to the *Cantong Qi*. Even ten thousand generations later, those of keen intelligence at the Yanmen gate could not comprehend them on their own. Fangweng said: \"The gate that gives me life, the door that brings my death—how many are awake? How many are enlightened? Last night, the iron man pondered deeply: long life and immortality are made by man. Are not the gate that gives me life and the door that brings my death these two cavities?\"\n\nAs previously explained, the principles of Qian and Kun, the sun and moon, and the workings of creation—once the mysterious barrier is firmly established, the text proceeds to discuss the two substances, metal and water, in order. It is not vague. The cultivator of the Elixir, having understood these apertures, must further discern what the metal qi is, what mutual dependence entails, and what its uses are. Only with deep and thorough comprehension can one refine the Elixir.\n\nTo \"know the white\" is to recognize the purity of its essence—pure white and unstained, this is knowing the white. To \"guard the black\" is to preserve the foundation of the black, awaiting the time when water is generated—this is guarding the black. The initial arising of water is called \"prior-heaven,\" for its utmost truth is called \"spiritual clarity.\" When white and black correspond, metal and water flourish abundantly. Once Ji earth restrains the water, the gold is refined, and metal and water fill the crucible. Thus it is said: \"Spiritual clarity comes of itself.\" What is called water? The pivot of the Dao, its number is one, for water is born from the Heavenly One and is the beginning of yin and yang. It contains the yellow sprout, as the *Yi* says: \"Though yin has beauty, it contains it to serve the king’s affairs.\" Thus, the Great Mystery becomes water, and the yellow sprout becomes the Elixir. Within water lies the Elixir, hence the metaphor: \"the mystery contains the yellow sprout.\" Within black lead lies white metal; within the river chariot lies the yellow sprout—just as a scholar may conceal jade, and if clad in coarse cloth, harm will not befall him.\n\nMetal is the mother of water, for Dui metal generates Kan water, and the middle line of Kan belongs to metal. Thus it is said: \"The mother’s womb holds the child; the fetal water is metal.\" The child is the Ren and Gui waters, born from the west. The middle line of Dui belongs to Kan, hence it is said: \"The child is concealed within the mother’s womb.\" The \"perfected man of utmost subtlety\" is the body of Qian. Qian is the most spiritual and wondrous of things; its form is sometimes present, sometimes absent. The \"great abyss\" is the image of Kun. Kun can sink or float; its form is neither seen nor heard. Thus, Qian can transform, and Kun’s virtue is to give birth. Once transformation and birth occur, Qian and Kun are distributed, each guarding its domain.\n\nTo \"gather the white\" is to extract silver from lead, which is white. Refining it produces the national Elixir, which is vermilion; refining it alone yields lead powder. This is akin to gathering and refining external cinnabar. Thus, the external Elixir must have an outer guard, appearing as vermilion’s radiance, while internally preserving its true whiteness. \"Residing in a square inch, mixed yet mutually constrained\"—within the obscure barrier lies a thing, the time before the Great Ultimate divided, which is prior-heaven. Within it resides the prior-heaven true unity of qi, dwelling before the Great Ultimate, before the image of the Lord. Thus it is said: \"majestic and lofty.\" \"Surrounding it are walls and gates, resembling Penglai Island\"—Qian’s image is also like walls and gates, like Penglai. The imagery describes the body, and the Yi hour is like the above, all referring to the crucible. \"Encircling and enclosing\" is the outer guard; \"four passages sealed\" is the tight external defense.",
      "overlap_context": ", with four passages sealed. Hesitating, one guards and defends, tightly securing to block all treachery. Curved yet interconnected, it wards against the unforeseen. One may be free from anxious thought, from wearying the spirit and qi. The chamber is full, yet nothing can remain. Those who guard it prosper; those who lose it perish. In movement and stillness, rest and activity, it is ever with man.\n\nThe man of superior virtue is one whose embodiment is complete, a scholar of \"nothing not done.\"",

      "translated_text": "Guard and defense must be tightly sealed, never to be parted from for even a moment—what can be parted from is not the Dao. Blocking and cutting off wickedness requires regulating entry and exit with methodical restraint, keeping internal and external in check so that fear is instilled and the true white within may reside undisturbed. Where curves meet and connect, one must establish a sacred precinct, strictly guarded to prevent unforeseen calamity. The Immortal Elder, in his compassion, from \"encircling and enclosing\" onward, has given explicit instruction, fearing harm from the unforeseen. One must remain free from thought and worry, never allowing sorrow or toil to intrude. Thus it is said: one may be without thought, but not with sorrow or labor, lest the spirit and qi fill the chamber only to suffer depletion. Hence, \"those who guard it prosper; those who lose it perish.\" Even the slightest lapse in vigilance may lead to ruin. Therefore, in movement and stillness, rest and activity, not a moment may be spent in carelessness or neglect. Then the qi of the golden crucible will be firm for both self and other, mutually harmonizing and subduing. Thus it is said: \"it is ever with man.\"\n\nThis chapter directly points to the essence of the two apertures, elucidating the function of metal and water. For the practitioner of cultivation, reading and reciting the *Cantong Qi* to this point, one realizes that the very first step is a matter of great difficulty. Those of lesser virtue who practice the Dao of deliberate action rely entirely on refining the self. If self-refinement is even slightly lacking, the numinous will not come.\n\n**Chapter Eight: Discerning the Upright and the Deviant**\n\nThose who engage in internal visualization of the five viscera, contemplative breathing, external pacing of the Dipper and constellations, or stepping the celestial stems and branches; those who practice the Yin Dao to suppress the Nine Ones, disturb the primordial womb, consume qi, or cause the intestines to rumble; those who expel the upright and inhale external evil, remaining sleepless day and night, never resting through dark and new moon—such practitioners exhaust the body daily, growing weary and disoriented, appearing as if deranged, their hundred vessels seething like a boiling cauldron, unable to attain clarity. Dwelling in earthen huts, erecting altars, offering morning and evening sacrifices, invoking spirits to manifest forms, dreaming of encounters and stirring emotions, they rejoice and delight, believing their lives will surely be prolonged. Yet suddenly, their allotted span ends, their bodies decay and rot, their forms exposed. Every action they take is contrary and rebellious, losing the pivotal mechanism. Such arts are myriad, numbering in the thousands, even tens of thousands. Yet they all deviate from the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, twisting and turning to incur the wrath of the Nine Capitals.\n\nThe wise, perceiving these pitfalls, understand the cause and practice diligently, never resting day or night. After three years of ingesting the elixir, they may wander far, walking through fire unscathed, entering water unsoaked, able to preserve or abandon life at will, ever joyful and free from care. Having attained the Dao and perfected virtue, they conceal themselves to await the time when the Great One summons them, relocating to the Central Continent. Once their merit is complete, they ascend, receiving registers and charts.\n\nThe practitioner of cultivation must comprehend the true great Dao. Without the union of yin and yang, the transformation of Kan and Li, all else is but peripheral and left-handed paths. Practices such as internal visualization of the five viscera, contemplative breathing, external pacing of the Dipper, stepping the celestial stems, or manipulating mudras; those who engage in chamber arts, controlling the Three Peaks through sexual rites, or practice the Nine Ones, sword techniques, or the Five Affairs, disturbing the primordial womb by interfacing with external qi—these are all perverse practices, the lowest of the peripheral paths. Others expel the upright and inhale the deviant, endure hunger to consume qi, or discuss longevity through seated meditation, remaining awake day and night; or erect altars to sacrifice to spirits, seeing apparitions and forms. These are the chaotic paths of the peripheral ways, scattering the spirit and causing the hundred vessels to seethe, the mind to rejoice daily, and dreams to stir nightly. Though they traverse a thousand paths and a hundred routes, all is without merit. Having deviated from the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, their words do not align with true masters, nor do they harmonize with the union of yin and yang. Twisting and turning, they incur the wrath of the Nine Capitals—how then can they coalesce the pearl of a single grain of millet? Hoping to prolong life, they instead shorten it.\n\nYet if there are those of discernment who encounter the words of a true master, they will practice with unwavering diligence, never resting day or night, seeking the medicine with single-minded devotion. After three years of secretive ingestion and practice, they may wander freely, and in nine years, their bodies will become light. After twelve years of accumulation, neither water nor fire can harm them. Dwelling in grotto-heavens, they live without care, feasting in the Jasper Pool with eternal joy. Having attained the Dao, they conceal themselves further, accumulating virtue to await the time when the Three Heavens record their name, and the Great One summons them to assume a position as an immortal, relocating to the Central Continent. If their merit is great, they may ascend through the Three Realms, receiving promotions and seals, accepting registers and charts—like Zhang, Ge, Jingyang, Fuqiu, Zhong, and Lü, the ranks of the perfected. Such is the path the sage should follow.\n\nIn this chapter, the Immortal Elder forcefully distinguishes between delusion and clarity, deviance and uprightness. Deviance incurs the punishment of the Nine Capitals; uprightness leads to merit fulfilled and ascension—this is the inevitable principle, leaving no room for doubt. As for the sequence of practice and the steps to be taken, they follow below.\n\n**Chapter Nine: The Two Caverns of Dragon and Tiger**\n\nThe fire calculations are not empty; they are expounded through the *Yi* to clarify them. The crescent moon method applies to the crucible: the White Tiger serves as the pivot for refinement, mercury as the flowing pearl. The Green Dragon rises with it, the East uniting with the West. The hun and po naturally constrain each other. The upper cavern corresponds to the number eight of Dui; the lower cavern to the number eight of Gen. The two eights unite their essence, and the body of Qian and Kun is thus formed. Two eights make one jin—this is the true, unerring Dao of the *Yi*.\n\nOnly now does the Immortal Elder lay out the crucible and furnace, the Dragon and Tiger, and the qi of the caverns. The crescent moon crucible, the White Tiger, the upper cavern, Dui, and the po all pertain to the West—*that* is the Jade Pool.",

      "translated_text": "The terms \"everlasting sun,\" \"flowing pearl,\" \"Green Dragon,\" \"lower cavern,\" *Gen*, and *hun* pertain to the East—*this* is the self, the Golden Crucible. The crescent moon crucible is called the Great Unity Divine Crucible, known as the Yin Crucible. Its inverted and upright form resembles the moon at its first crescent. The White Tiger is a being of the Western *Dui* Palace. When heaven and earth first divided, it originally belonged to *that* realm. The tiger’s majesty responds when summoned; its radiant essence nurtures the growth of all things. Though it may harm or kill, it harbors the vast qi of the Great Vehicle. King Wen, in his reworking of the *Yi*, said: *\"Treading on the tiger’s tail, it does not bite—auspicious.\"* And again: *\"Treading the level Way, the secluded one holds to virtue—auspicious.\"* Confucius said: *\"Joy responds to Qian.\"* And again: *\"To tread in purity and go forth alone—this is my wish.\"* Those who cultivate the elixir must first fear this tiger and subdue it. Once subdued, it may serve as the pivot for refinement without biting.\n\n*Li* is the sun, the everlasting sun, within which lies cinnabar, called the flowing pearl. The Green Dragon is a being of the Eastern *Zhen* Palace. Once the kalpa is firmly established, it originally belongs to *this* realm. The dragon’s power is transformative; it responds and communicates, moving with clouds and rain, shaping all things. In *Qian*’s nine-two: *\"The dragon appears in the field—auspicious to see the great person.\"* The Master said: *\"The dragon’s virtue is upright and centered.\"* Yet people, failing to grasp the dragon’s life-generating power, are often harmed by it. If one awakens to it, respects it, and regulates and subdues it, one may then harness and employ it. Raising the East to unite with the West is the harmonious union of ritual and propriety.\n\n*Dui* and *Gen* each bear the number eight, flowing from *wu* to *ji*. *Hun* and *po* naturally constrain each other; metal and wood do not stand apart. The two caverns unite their essence, and the body of *Qian* and *Kun* is formed. That the Dao of the *Yi* does not falter is because the two eights balance to form one *jin*. One *jin* denotes the number of completion, for numbers accumulate from small to great: ten grains make a pellet, one pellet like a millet seed, one millet seed slightly more than a *daogui*. Sixty-four millet seeds make one *gui*; ten millet seeds make a *lei*; ten *lei* make a *zhu*; two *zhu* and four *lei* make a *qian*; ten *qian* make a *liang*; eight *zhu* make a *dian*. The *Shuowen* says six *zhu* make a *zi*; the *Jian Yun* says eight *liang* make a *zi*—both are incorrect. Three *zi* make a *liang*, which is twenty-four *zhu*. Sixteen *liang* make one *jin*; one *jin* has three hundred eighty-four *zhu*; one *jin* and four *liang* make a *lüe*.\n\nThe ancients divided the *zhu* to correspond to the numbers of the hexagrams and lines.\n\n**Chapter Ten: Metal Returns to Its Nature**\nWhen metal enters the fierce fire, its color does not fade; its radiance remains. Since the opening of heaven and earth, the sun and moon have never dimmed, nor has metal lost its weight. The sun and moon retain their forms as usual. Metal is fundamentally born from the moon. At the new moon, the sun receives its tally; at the dark moon, they embrace and conceal their outlines, sinking into the cavernous void. Metal regains its original nature, its majesty and radiance, and the crucible glows.\n\nThe Immortal Elder does not speak idly. Only now does he point to the function of metal, for without metal’s power, the elixir cannot be formed. Thus it is called the Golden Elixir—not the gold or jade of the world, nor that extracted from earth and stone, but the marvel of heaven and earth’s alchemy, the inversion of the Five Phases, produced from the great transformative cavern of *Qian* and *Kun*. *This* is the true metal.\n\nToday’s blind masters, when speaking of the Golden Elixir, grow flustered, not knowing what it is. They prattle of cultivation yet have never heard the name of the Golden Elixir, nor do they fathom the words of the *Cantong Qi*. They deceive the world, unaware that the Immortal Elder has clearly pointed to this metal’s divine transformations. Some fools, upon seeing this text, fail to examine the true body and function of yin-yang metal and instead guess it refers to smelting and furnace fires. How pitiful! How deluded! If no hint were given to the world, in ten thousand generations this text would grow ever more lofty and distant. People, unable to glimpse its shores, would abandon it entirely—how then could they seek the path of cultivation?\n\nThose of superior roots and keen faculties must know: this metal existed before the primordial chaos, before the Great Ultimate divided. It originally belonged to *Qian*, hence it is called *Qian*-metal. When the great kalpa is about to turn, those who repay the virtue of chaos arrive. At this moment, *Qian* first unites with *Kun*. This metal stumbles and gallops, rushing into the *Kun* Palace—it is called *Kun*-within-metal. *Kun*’s three lines are originally hollow, called *Kun*-earth. When this metal fills its center, it forms the *Kan* trigram. *Kan*’s proper position is in the north, the land of *Gui* water. Thus *Kan* is water, with metal concealed within—hence it is called water-within-metal. This water-within-metal is the treasure of the prior heaven, yet it cannot long remain in the posterior *Kan*. It transforms into *Dui*. *Dui* may leap from the northern *Kan*’s door, residing to the right in the western sky’s *You* direction. There, this metal grows day and night. *You*’s proper position belongs to *Dui*, so this metal governs the elixir’s path within *Dui*—hence it is called *Dui*-metal.\n\nThose who refine the elixir must seek the subtle and trace the hidden, investigate beginnings and ends, study things to gain knowledge, explore their sources and streams, and examine their roots and sprouts. If one refines the Golden Elixir, one must seek this metal. To seek this metal, one does not seek in *Qian*, nor in *Kun*, nor in *Kan*, but solely in *Dui*. *Dui* is the same vessel as *Kun*-moon. As the saying goes: *\"The same vessel is easy to work; different vessels are hard to craft.\"* *Dui*’s marvel is that it acts in *Kun*’s stead. Thus, in refining the Golden Elixir, apart from this *Dui*-metal, all other paths are side doors that cannot lead to the Dao. The Yellow Emperor, Laozi, and the ancient sages and immortals all used this metal to complete the Dao.\n\nKing Wen, in reworking *Xun*’s nine-five, said: *\"Three days before *geng*, three days after *geng*.\"* Confucius, in his commentary on *Yi*, said: *\"Wing follows *Dui*; the yielding complies with the firm.\"* The noble one, in issuing commands and acting, follows *geng*—for *geng* is metal. The scripture says: *\"Three days, and the moon emerges at *geng*.\"* Moreover, Śākyamuni relied on this metal to attain Buddhahood, hence he is called the Golden Immortal. This *Dui*-within-metal is born of the same body as the celestial Great Yin, shining simultaneously with it. The moon in the sky is called the Great Yin. Because this *Dui*-metal shares its function, it is also called the Lesser Yin, or yin-within-metal. The celestial Great Yin receives the radiance of the Great Yang to complete the seasons. The Lesser Yin of *Dui* continues the transformation of the great thousand worlds, giving birth to beings and things.\n\nThe Immortal Elder, having penetrated the wisdom of former sages, knew the root of this metal, traced its marvelous transformations, and revealed its divine changes. As for worldly metal, though it may endure as long as heaven and earth, entering fire only refines its color, and prolonged refining does not diminish its weight—how much more so this *Dui*-metal, born from the great transformative crucible of *Qian* and *Kun*!",

The two eights unite their essence, and the body of Qian and Kun is thus formed. Two eights make one jin—this is the true, unerring Dao of the *Yi*.\n\nOnly now does the Immortal Elder lay out the crucible and furnace, the Dragon and Tiger, and the qi of the caverns. The crescent moon crucible, the White Tiger, the upper cavern, Dui, and the po all pertain to the West—*that* is the Jade Pool.",

      "translated_text": "The moon’s light waxes and wanes, and the *Dui*-metal flows and turns—thus it is said that its form remains constant. At the new moon, sun and moon unite as jade discs; the moon receives the sun’s tally and manifests the light of the first yang at the *gengshen* position—this is the celestial Great Yin. Correspondingly, this *Dui*-metal, in accord with the moon’s new phase, also generates the first yang’s cinnabar at the primal chaos position on the third day—this is the worldly Lesser Yin. Hence it is said that metal is born from the moon. At the new moon, the sun confers its tally—how then does metal return to its mother? The trigram of metal is *Dui*; the mother of *Dui* is *Kun*. *Dui* cannot long retain its metal; the metal, too, acts in accordance with the seasons. The wing of *Kun* is called \"containing pattern, steadfast in season\"—it acts in due time.\n\nThe sage’s mind is wondrous in this: once the metal is activated, *Dui* returns to its mother and enfolds itself in *Kun*, just as the moon at its darkest is wholly enveloped by the sun. Why is this? On the last day of the lunar month, the moon’s entire body is concealed, its vast expanse covered by the sun. On the first, second, and third days, it moves through its degrees, and its radiance is again emitted. Likewise, when metal returns to its mother, the metal’s true essence sinks and merges with the profound void, becoming the world’s utility. From one comes two, from two comes three; when the kalpic cycle turns again, the metal will be reborn. If this metal is reborn, it must restore its original nature. Why? Nature is the function of *Qian*; *Qian* is uprightness. Entrusting metal to *Kun*, *Kun* to *Kan*, *Kan* to *Dui*—the *Dui*-metal unfolds its essence and restores its original nature, thereby returning this metal to the palace of *Qian*. The metal crucible of *Qian* regains its seed, and through refinement, the golden elixir is formed. Thus, this elixir is called the \"golden liquid returning elixir,\" and the crucible is named the \"majestic radiance golden crucible.\" It is said that the \"majestic radiance crucible\" is so named because of the blazing, flourishing fire—this golden elixir, as recorded in the alchemical texts, is revered and feared by the sun, moon, stars, celestial dragons, true lords, and divine spirits of creation, all of whom gather to protect it.\n\n**Chapter Eleven: The Full Merit of the Two Earths**\n\nThe numbers of *zi* and *wu* unite; the three *wu* and *ji* are called the five threes. Once harmonized, the eight stones form the proper framework. Breathing nurtures and embraces; awaiting the union of husband and wife, yellow earth is the father of metal, the flowing pearl the child of water. Water regards earth as its dam; earth subdues water to prevent overflow. The Vermilion Bird is the essence of fire, balancing victory and defeat. If water prevails, fire is extinguished; if both perish, they return to the fertile earth. The three natures unite to guard their original essence, sharing a common ancestor. The great victory lies in sesame—consumed regularly as food, it prolongs life. How much more so the returning elixir, refined from metal, water, *wu*, and *ji* into the supreme treasure of heaven and earth? Cultivators who subdue and ingest it attain longevity equal to the sun and moon.\n\nTo subdue is to subdue the primordial qi; to ingest is to swallow the millet-like elixir. Later generations mistakenly write \"ingest\" as \"serve,\" unaware of the subtlety of \"subduing.\" Thus, the immortal masters say: \"Subdue qi, not essence; to ingest essence, one must first subdue qi. Ingesting essence does not grant longevity; longevity requires subduing essence.\" The single word \"subdue\" reverses the mechanism of transformation.\n\nEarth travels through the four seasons—the four seasons being *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei*. Earth has its ruling days in each season, reigning for eighteen days during its \"travels.\" Only in summer, when fire generates earth, does earth’s virtue prevail. Metal fears fire, so when autumn arrives, belonging to the *shen* month, the ancients held that both water and earth are born in *shen*. Earth arises from summer’s fire, while water emerges at the three enclosures, gradually restraining fire. Thus, earth generates metal at the beginning of autumn. Earth’s virtue first reigns for nine days, generating *geng*-metal, and ceases at *xu*, where it divides its reign for nine days.\n\nTo guard boundaries and set rules: in the east, *Di* earth guards the boundary of the Azure Dragon; in the west, *Wei* earth regulates the power of the White Tiger; in the south, *Liu* earth squares the gate of the fire of *Li*; in the north, *Nü* earth stabilizes the door of the water of *Kan*. This enables the restraint of the essence of cinnabar and true metal, which returns to the five viscera. When the elixir first arrives, its qi disperses like mist, moistening like rain. The elixir’s qi, through steaming and permeation, reaches the four limbs. Once the spirit and qi are complete, the complexion becomes joyful, teeth regrow, hair blackens, and the aged return to youth. The withered form is transformed, forever escaping the calamities of the mundane world. Both form and spirit become wondrous—such is the Purple Radiance Perfected.\n\nThis chapter states that to begin refining the elixir, one must first harmonize the *wu* and *ji* earths before gathering metal and water to form the elixir.\n\n*Zi* resides in the north, the proper position of *Kan*, its number one. *Wu* resides in the south, the proper position of *Li*, its number two. Within *Kan* lies earth, called *wu*, its number five. Within *Li* lies earth, called *ji*, its number five. *Wu* presides over the gate of *Kan*, holding the primordial true unity. *Ji* stands at the door of *Li*, accumulating the postnatal utmost true mercury. To seek the primordial unity, one must pass through *wu*-earth; to employ the postnatal mercury, one must subdue it with *ji*-earth. Once *zi* and *wu* are harmonious, and *wu*-earth is harmonized, the essences of the two fives wondrously unite and congeal. *Wu* enters the *ji* crucible, and the two earths coalesce, hence named \"the jade tablet.\" Entering the stone, it becomes *Kun*; *Kun* is the mother of all stones. Without *Kun*, the framework of *Dui* cannot be maintained. *Zi* and *wu* breathe in harmony; *wu* and *ji* nurture and embrace; lead and mercury intertwine as husband and wife.\n\nYellow earth is *wu*-earth; *wu*-earth can generate the metal within *Dui*, thus it is the father of metal. The flowing pearl is wood-mercury; lead-water can nourish the mercury within wood, thus the flowing pearl is the child of water. Lead-water regards *wu*-earth as its dam; *wu*-earth, once settled in the central palace, prevents water from flowing recklessly outward. The Vermilion Bird is the being within *Li*, the essence of fire. When the heart is calm and the qi harmonized, the pulse stabilizes, allowing one to regulate victory and defeat. Water overcomes fire, fire overcomes metal, metal overcomes wood—when all four are extinguished, their merit returns to the fertile earth. Fertile earth is *ji*-earth.\n\nThe three natures are *wu*-metal and water. The gate of *Kan* is called *wu*; the middle line of *Kan* is *Dui*-metal. Metal generates the water of the Great One; once metal generates water, *wu* restrains it—thus the three natures unite to guard their essence. Wood-nature is *ji*-earth; the door within *Li* is called *ji*. When *wu*-metal, water, and *ji*-wood unite, wood gradually overcomes them, transforming all into the great elixir. Thus, it is said that the original nature shares a common ancestor.\n\nThe great victory refers to sesame; if sesame is regularly consumed as food, it can prolong life. How much more so the returning elixir, refined from metal, water, *wu*, and *ji* into the supreme treasure of heaven and earth? Cultivators who subdue and ingest it attain longevity equal to the sun and moon. To subdue is to subdue the primordial qi; to ingest is to swallow the millet-like elixir.

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Twelve: Uniting Like-Kind in One Body**\n\nWhen ceruse is cast into fire, its color corrupts and reverts to lead; when ice and snow meet warm broth, they dissolve into supreme gold. Cinnabar serves as the master, harmonizing with mercury—its transformations arise from its authenticity, beginning and ending in mutual dependence. Those who seek to refine and ingest the immortal elixir must unite like-kind: just as planting grain requires grain for cover, and hatching chicks demands eggs, so too does *qi* assist the natural process of things to completion. How could fish eyes become pearls? How could mugwort transform into sandalwood? Only like-kind may follow one another; discordant affairs cannot yield treasure. Swallows do not birth phoenixes; foxes and hares do not nurse horses. Water does not flow upward in flames; fire does not moisten downward. In the world, many scholars, though lofty and gifted, meet no opportunity. They exhaust their fire and squander their resources, relying on texts and following words blindly, lacking the threads of causation. Their measures and methods fail; they pound and refine malachite, mica, alum, magnetite, and sulfur, burning cedar clay in mutual refinement. They bellow beneath the Five Stones and copper, using them as aids and pivots. Yet their natures differ—how could they willingly unite as one? A thousand attempts must end in ten thousand failures. They strive in vain, growing foolish with age until their hair turns white. Midway, they spawn doubts, forsaking the Dao to cling to delusion, straying from the true path into crooked byways. Their vision narrows like peering through a tube; how can they fathom the methods of the future?\n\nCeruse is refined black lead; when it meets fire, it returns to its original nature. Ice and snow are congealed cold water; when they encounter warmth, they revert to their source. Gold enters mercury and turns white; when fired, it regains its red hue. The world’s people are ensnared by desires, their natures disordered. Yet preserving one’s nature grants longevity. What does it mean for gold to take cinnabar as its master? What does it mean to harmonize with mercury? Those who cultivate the Dao must clarify these transformations and penetrate yin and yang. To refine the golden elixir, first accumulate the cinnabar of *li*-fire to harmonize with the mercury of the Jade Pool. Then employ the water of *kan* to temper the fire of *li*. When water and fire are balanced, gold and cinnabar unite in form, their transformations arising from the authenticity of like-kind, beginning and ending with the union of female and male.\n\nThus, those who seek to refine and ingest the immortal elixir must rely on like-kind—this is the truth. Just as planting grain requires grain, and hatching chicks requires eggs, so too must those who aspire to become immortals or Buddhas adhere to like-kind. Though one may enter the marketplace a hundred times or sit in meditation for a thousand years, they will ultimately fall into emptiness. Without studying the union of like-kind, pursuing side paths—whether bedroom arts, controlling women, or the Three Peaks’ techniques—are all deviant roads. They mistake fish eyes for pearls and mugwort for sandalwood, unaware that transformations arise from authenticity. Swallows are but flying birds.",

      "translated_text": "The phoenix cannot be born of foxes or hares, nor beasts of the field; how then could a mare give birth to a foal? These are not of like-kind. Water’s transformation cannot ascend in flame, nor can fire’s power moisten and descend—all because the interplay of yin and yang must follow the Dao of nature. The Immortal Elders teach that one must seek an enlightened master, study the union of like-kind, and harmonize yin and yang before speaking of the elixir.\n\nWhen my master, the Purple Jade Elder, first received instruction from the Perfected One of Great Emptiness, the first question upon entering the chamber was whether the *Cantong Qi* (\"Token for the Agreement of the Three\") clarified the *Yi* (Changes) or facilitated its practice. The Perfected One of Great Emptiness replied: \"The *Yi* consists solely of yin and yang. Only by understanding and practicing these can one become a sage.\" Thus, the *Yi* states: \"In the southwest, one gains companions and proceeds with like-kind.\" The *Cantong Qi* says: \"Like-kind follows in accord; discord fails to form the treasure.\" First, one must understand; afterward, one practices—this is the way of the sage.\n\nYet how many later generations, despite possessing fine and wondrous talents, fail to seek a true master? Instead, they rely on ancient texts, idly speculating and measuring by their own whims. Some use *shao*-era stone gallbladder to refine gold, or *chen*-era cinnabar and silver to burn the elixir. They pound and refine the Five Metals, smelt the Eight Stones, take the Three Yellows as like-kind, and use pure red copper as an auxiliary pivot. But these stones and metals are not of our like-kind—how could they willingly merge with our essence and dwell within our bodies?\n\nIn former times, Minister Zhang of Jiujiang refined and ingested the elixir. Lü Dongbin, pitying his earnest devotion to the Dao, transformed into a scholar to visit and guide him. Zhang, self-assured from long elixir consumption, believed himself certain of ascension and treated Dongbin with scant courtesy. Dongbin abruptly departed, leaving behind a poem on his seat:\n\n*Alas, Minister Zhang of Jiujiang,*\n*Ingesting elixirs, he lost his sight;*\n*His spirit withered, his qi dried up.*\n*He never thought to return to the rootless elixir,*\n*But vainly consumed metal and stone—how foolish!*\n*In the end, his eyes failed, and he perished.*\n\nSuch men, lacking true talent and clinging stubbornly to their ways, willingly suffer the misguidance of blind masters. They mistake metal and stone for like-kind, squandering their wealth on refining and ingestion, often meeting their end without ever daring to abandon their errors. Like those who peer at the sky through a tube, how could they know that true immortals and sagely masters exist in the world? People, habituated to the commonplace, neither seek inquiry nor strive to visit masters widely. Their narrow vision and lowly gaze are unfit to perceive lofty and distant matters. Yet they strut about, calling themselves great men—all while squandering their fine and wondrous talents through self-reliance and complacency.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: The Foreknowledge of the Three Sages**\n\nThe utmost sage is none other than Fuxi, who first drew the Eight Trigrams, modeling them on heaven and earth. King Wen of the Zhou dynasty, the ancestor of emperors, structured the trigrams and composed the line statements. Confucius, the most eminent of sages, added the Ten Wings to assist them. These three lords, raised by heaven, arose in succession to govern their times. Though their merits and virtues differed in degree, their creations followed one another, each building upon the last. Weighing the tangible is easy; measuring the formless is difficult. Their works established models for the world, and their *Book of Poetry* and *Book of Documents* lacked prior foreknowledge, relying instead on their masters’ awakening—like the bright moon emerging from behind a cold curtain. They ascended the high terrace, and the *Fire Records* of six hundred chapters differed not in essence from written words. Yet people do not deeply ponder or trace the origins of these texts, though the obscure and manifest share a common dwelling.\n\nHow could a worthy discuss these matters lightly? If I were to remain silent and cut off the Dao, I would incur punishment. Yet to express my thoughts on bamboo and silk might risk leaking heavenly secrets. Hesitant and sighing, I humbly record these foolish words. Though the crafting of the Dao follows principles, I cannot fully expound them here. I shall briefly outline the essentials, and the branches will naturally become clear.\n\n**Chapter Eight: On Preceding and Following the Yellow and the Old**\n\nThe Yellow Emperor and Laozi—two great sages—here elucidate the teachings of the Three Sages and their transmitted instructions. Their reverence for the sages of old and those to come is evident. Looking back at later scholars, who know nothing yet recklessly boast and slander—what punishment do their crimes deserve?\n\nThe *Classic* states: \"The utmost sage is none other than Fuxi.\" Fuxi is also written as Paoxi or Fuxi. Confucius’ *Wings* say: \"In ancient times, when Paoxi ruled the world, he looked up to observe the patterns of heaven and down to model himself on the earth. He studied the markings of birds and beasts and the suitability of the land, drawing near to his own body and far to external things. Thus, he first drew the Eight Trigrams to communicate the virtue of spiritual illumination and to accord with the nature of the myriad things.\" King Wen structured the trigrams and composed the line statements, noting in the southwest: \"One gains companions.\" What subtle meaning does this hold? The Ten Wings assist the *Yi*.\n\nThe *Yi* consists of two parts: the *Zhengjing* (Main Classic). Fuxi drew the trigrams, King Wen composed the line statements, and the Duke of Zhou wrote the line texts—together forming two chapters. Confucius added ten chapters as wings: the *Upper and Lower Commentaries on the Judgments*, the *Great and Small Images*, the *Appended Remarks* (upper and lower), the *Words of the Text*, and the *Discussion of the Trigrams* (upper, middle, and lower)—ten chapters in all. These are called the Ten Wings, not \"explanations\" but \"wings,\" for they assist the Dao of the *Yi*.\n\nThe sages, venerating those before and modeling those after, made the *Classic* the classic and the *Wings* the wings, so that later scholars would know that sages dare not surpass their predecessors or disorder the *Main Classic*. From Shang Qu to Fei Meng and Liangqiu Fei, Fei said: \"The *Judgment* texts explain the *Classic*, so the two wings were placed beneath each hexagram.\" Fei’s *Yi* disrupted the sacred classic. Fei Zhi did not understand the sages’ intent to neither precede nor disorder. If the sacred classic could be disordered, Confucius would have long since separated and explained it.\n\nFei’s tradition continued to Zheng Kangcheng, who followed Fei’s teachings. Zheng said: \"The *Wenyan* commentary explains the Qian and Kun trigrams,\" so he moved it after Qian and Kun. Later, Wang Bi followed Fei and Zheng. Wang said: \"The *Xiang* explains the lines,\" so he moved it after each line statement, adding \"Xiang says\" and \"Tuan says.\" Within a few hundred years, the *Yi* was disordered thrice. The *Main Classic* was disrupted, and the *Wings* were lost. Fei Zhi began the corruption, and Zheng and Wang followed. Today’s *Yi* is not the *Zhou Yi* but the *Yi* of Wang Bi.\n\nMany former worthies sought to restore the *Zhou Yi*’s wings. In the Song dynasty, Li Tao, Chao Yuezhi, and Ouyang Xiu all attempted to collate and establish the *Zhou Yi*, believing it to be the ancient *Yi*. Li Tao said: \"The *Zhou Yi*’s twelve chapters were first disordered by Fei, greatly confused by Wang Bi, and then restored and collated as the *Ancient Yi*, printed at the prefectural school.\" Chao Yuezhi re-established the *Ancient Yi*, with the *Main Classic* in two chapters and the Ten Wings in ten chapters. The *Shuogua* (Discussion of the Trigrams) in two chapters was lost. Ouyang Xiu said: \"The Qin fires preserved the *Yi*’s *Main Classic* for divination, so the Ten Wings’ texts scattered among the people. Emperor Wen of Han widely sought texts, but only the *Tuan*, *Xiang*, *Xici*, and *Wenyan* remained. Later, during Emperor Xuan’s reign, a woman from the Yellow River region unearthed a tomb and found a complete *Yi*, which she presented to the court. The *Shuogua*’s middle and lower chapters were damaged beyond recognition. Thus, two wings of the Ten Wings were truly lost. Later generations used the *Xugua* and *Zagua* to complete the Ten Wings, but this is incorrect.\"",

      "translated_text": "The wording is shallow, and later Confucians merely echoed one another. Only Master Cheng possessed a vision of true insight. In his posthumous writings, he stated: \"The *Xugua* does not embody the profound essence of the *Yi*; this contradicts the Dao.\" Later, Zhang Zai, with a single stroke of the master craftsman’s axe, refuted this—yet this too was incorrect. Only Master Cheng recognized that two chapters were truly lost.\n\nZhu Zhen said: \"Only the *Gan* trigram constitutes the original text of the *Zhouyi*.\" Wang Bi dared not disrupt it. Zhu Xi said: \"The *Zhouyi*’s two chapters of the *Main Classic* comprise Fu Xi’s trigrams, King Wen and the Duke of Zhou’s words, and the ten chapters of commentary composed by Confucius—altogether twelve chapters. Amidst considerable confusion introduced by later Confucians, I have now thoroughly rectified and restored them: two chapters of the *Main Classic* with annotations, and ten chapters of the Wings, thus reviving the original structure of Confucius’ edition.\" From Zhu Xi’s time to the present, two hundred years have passed, yet the original has still not been restored.

      "translated_text": "When about to act or proceed, one inquires and, through words, receives the mandate—as if an echo, without regard to distance or depth, one thereby knows what is to come. For depth is precisely what is called \"elusive and obscure, dim and dark.\" When a noble person acts or proceeds, it must be within this elusive and obscure, dim and dark, that they know what is to come. If not for the utmost refinement in the world, who could partake in this? The immortal elder’s words on the Ten Wings as an aid are thus exhaustive.\n\nThe sages’ efforts benefit all equally in later ages, yet one fears that scholars may lack great good fortune or great wisdom, rendering them unfit to bear it. A thousand kinds of obstructions arise, leaving no means to witness or hear. The Three Sages arose in succession, creating and measuring, establishing a model for ten thousand generations. We must revere the supreme Dao: heaven-born sages and wise ones—how could they have awakened on their own? They necessarily relied on teachers’ instruction. Even if one possesses intelligence, planning, and deliberation, it is as if something obstructs. Yet if a benevolent and worthy person devotes their mind to thorough inquiry and suddenly gains a teacher’s guidance, their heart and mind become open and clear—just as if, within a chamber, the curtains were drawn back, revealing all distinctly and penetratingly, or as if, with eyes closed, one ascended a high terrace: what would not be seen?\n\nIf one does not seek a teacher, how could one awaken? Should one have a teacher, one must first examine the *Cantong Qi* (The Seal of the Unity of the Three). If one can clarify every sentence and thoroughly comprehend every chapter, this is true attainment. But if even a single phrase remains vague or ambiguous, it cannot be trusted. Apart from this text, to claim there is another path to accomplish the Dao is a great deception of others. Why?

      "translated_text": "Alas! Moreover, the *Yinfu Jing* of the Yellow Emperor, three hundred characters in length, and the *Daode Jing* of Laozi, five thousand in all, align without discrepancy—only when this Dao is understood. Thus, the Celestial Master Lao, Ge, Xu, and Fuqiu, along with all the immortals, entered the Way through this. Likewise, the *Wuzhen Pian* of Ziyang, the *Yuanduzi*, the *Jindan Nanwen*, and other texts all trace their origins to the *Cantong Qi*.\n\nExamine this: Buddhist scriptures and Daoist canons all accord with it. If someone claims, \"My teacher is so-and-so, and their teacher was so-and-so,\" their teachings flow like a river, yet when questioned on the *Cantong Qi*, they are largely ignorant. These are seeds of hell, who falsely assert that the supreme Dao is not found in texts, deceiving and blindly leading others. Who knows that this text alone is the true touchstone? Only when its authenticity is verified can one begin practice.\n\nFurthermore, the *Huoji Liu Bai* speaks of timings, hexagrams, secret words, and profound phrases—from beginning to end, it expounds with solemnity. Yet people do not deeply ponder or seek its source and flow, nor do they understand why the hidden and the manifest dwell together. This text is spoken for the worthy; how could it be lightly recounted? If one were to remain silent about the Way, how could it be transmitted? Yet to fully reveal it in writing would be to leak heavenly signs. Those who hesitate and sigh in regret resemble the creature called *youyu*. This beast, by nature indecisive, dwells in the mountains; hearing a sound, it hesitates between climbing a tree or descending, unable to decide—hence its name. The immortal elder himself said: \"Hesitating at the riverbank, fearing one’s neighbor, I sigh repeatedly, weighing and composing this text.\"\n\nYet, in refining later generations, the method is subtly revealed, though its oral instructions cannot be fully expounded. Here, only the essentials are outlined, with a glimpse of the branches.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: The Knife and the Measure of Golden Elixir**\n\nUse gold as a dike to guide the water, which then flows leisurely. The calculation of gold is fifteen, and the number of water is the same. When tending the furnace, fix the weights: five parts of water are excessive, two are authentic. Gold weighs as at its origin; the third part does not enter the fire. The two join together, and the three substances mutually embrace, transforming as if divine. Below, the qi of the Great Yang steams and seethes; in an instant, it first liquefies, then congeals, called the Yellow Chariot.\n\nAs years and months draw to an end, harm befalls longevity. The body becomes like ash and dust, resembling dust on a bright window. Pound and combine them, then hold them and enter the Crimson Gate. Secure its borders and ensure its completeness and firmness. Kindle the blazing fire below, day and night, with unceasing effort. Begin with civil methods, end with martial; observe and wait, adding caution. Scrutinize and adjust the cold and warmth, cycling through the twelve nodes. When each node is exhausted, one must personally draw in the qi. As life nears its end, cease death. The hun and po transform in color, turning crimson, and suddenly the Reverted Elixir is complete. Grind it into a single pill; the knife and measure are most divine.\n\nThe immortal elder expounds thus far to speak of entering the chamber, tending the furnace, beginning the work, and congealing the elixir within the crucible.\n\nThose of superior capacity should understand this text, proceeding in order without straying. The *Cantong Qi* is a single book; this chapter is of great significance, without which later generations would have no means to begin the practice of elixir refinement. Those who have not encountered a teacher or do not know this text find it profoundly abstruse. Upon reaching this chapter, it is as tasteless as chewing wax, with no entry point. They can only guess it refers to forging the Five Metals and Eight Stones, ultimately achieving nothing, then blame the sagely teachers for deceit—truly pitiable.\n\nNow, I slightly reveal the secret to dispel future doubts: \"Use gold as a dike\" refers to the great cultivator who, in refining the Ninefold Reverted Golden Elixir, must understand that this gold is the gold of the West, within *Dui*. First, establish a sincere heart to seek the *Dui* gold, set up an altar, and constantly maintain vigilance. Fortify the dike to await the generation of this gold’s water.\n\nThe water thus generated must be carefully measured and discerned: is it primordial water or postnatal water? If postnatal, the water is turbid and cannot be used to refine the Reverted Elixir. If primordial, one must wait until the water is clear before using it.\n\nA poem says:\n*The Jing is clear, the Wei is turbid*—\nthe Jing River is clear, the Wei River turbid.\nThe cultivator of the elixir awaits the clarity of the Jing River, flowing leisurely and guarded, without disturbance. This is called \"the water enters and flows leisurely.\" Within this clear water lies true gold. Zhou Xingsi said: \"Gold is born in the Li River, its clarity supreme.\"\n\nMoreover, one must know its weight and measure before use. This *Dui* gold must be approximately fifteen taels in weight, roughly equivalent to one catty. Thus, it is said: \"The calculation of gold is fifteen.\" When the gold weighs fifteen taels, it can generate the Li River’s water.\n\nWhat is meant by \"the number of water is the same\"? It does not mean the water is also fifteen taels, but that water and gold must correspond. Fifteen taels of gold will generate a certain amount of water, hence \"the same.\" Therefore, the immortal elder repeatedly emphasizes: when tending the furnace, first fix the weights. If fifteen taels of gold have generated five parts of water, the water is excessive and unusable—thus, \"five parts of water are excessive.\" If the *Dui* gold initially generates two parts of water, this is truly usable—thus, \"two are authentic.\" This two parts of water must correspond to fifteen taels of gold—thus, \"gold weighs as at its origin.\" If the water reaches three parts, it is also unusable—thus, \"the third does not enter.\" When the quantities of gold and water are timely and equal, swiftly combine them with two parts of fire—thus, \"fire, two, joins them.\" Once gold, water, and fire are combined, the fire receives the gold’s essence and is further restrained by the water, congealing into the Reverted Elixir, which transforms as if divine.\n\nAt the moment of beginning the furnace work, nothing is more crucial. Thus, the sage takes the month from the year, places gold within the month, measures the day by the tide, and selects the hour by the hexagram. Within the hour, the fire is fixed, and the talisman is enacted.\n\nWhat is \"enacting the talisman\"? The ancient sages and worthies regarded the refinement of the Golden Elixir as a great affair. They calculated the timings and established the clustered method: seventy-two seasonal nodes clustered into one day, three hundred sixty hexagrams gathered into one month, thirty-six talismans accounting for one day and night, divided among the twelve hours. Each hour contains six nodes; in elixir refinement, only two nodes are used. Each hour has one hexagram; in elixir refinement, less than half a hexagram’s duration is needed. Each hour has three talismans; in elixir refinement, only one talisman’s speed is used—this is the so-called \"single talisman, single decision.\"\n\nThus, the Yellow Emperor spoke of the *Yinfu*: \"People know the divine, but the divine does not know why it is divine.\" The immortal refining the elixir, in the span of one talisman, compresses the three thousand six hundred true breaths, reversing and drawing them into the womb. At this moment, they seize the creation of heaven and earth, the essence of the sun and moon. The earth’s axis and the heart of heaven are in hand; the dragon and tiger exchange their breaths, pounding the true unity of gold and water. The snake coils within the elixir furnace; the crow and hare move along the Yellow Path. Black and white intermingle, hardness and softness alternate. The jade crucible stores auspiciousness; purple radiance reflects the sun. Mars guards the western extreme; the Vermilion Bird blazes in the sky. It urges the water to move the gold, hastens the fire into the crucible, and steams with the qi of the Great Yang, congealing the elixir called the Yellow Chariot.",

Because this text is what King Wen, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius inherited from Fuxi.\n\nThus, the immortal elder said: \"Among the sages beneath ten thousand generations, who could surpass Confucius?\"",

      "translated_text": "When first refining the gold and water, one calculates the embankments by years and months, yet at the moment of compounding the elixir, only the work of a single *fu* is required. Prolonged effort damages one’s nature and harms the elixir; a single misstep injures one’s lifespan. Thus, as the years and months draw to a close, to damage one’s nature and shorten one’s years—when the very purpose of cultivating the elixir is to prolong life and ascend to transcendence—would be to err by a hair’s breadth and instead harm one’s longevity.\n\nTherefore, the immortal elders instruct later students: one must be cautious and meticulous. The dust on a bright window is likened to the subtlety of the elixir; the pounding and refining are the intermingling and tempering of yin and yang; the holding and entry are the preservation and reception of the elixir. The Crimson Gate is the portal of *qian*; the elixir returns through *qian*’s portal to the chamber of spirit. To \"seal firmly\" is to close the breath; \"guarding the boundaries\" refers to the nine orifices—all must be secure and complete, without any loss. The blazing fire below must burn day and night with unceasing vigilance, for when the yang elixir first arrives, it bears a sign: the fire within *li* is suddenly obtained, circulating day and night throughout the body. The hundred joints and ten thousand spirits all obey its command. One must diligently guard within, ensuring the breath is tranquil, the intent harmonious, the *qi* even, and the pulse stilled—only then does the elixir begin to congeal.\n\nAt first, one employs civil fire to refine the elixir, but both the beginning and the end require martial fire: martial fire to refine at the outset, martial fire to warm and nurture at the conclusion. Thus, the *Song of the Crucible* says: \"Martial at the start, martial at the end, civil in between.\" One must observe with utmost care, for negligence is not permissible. The *Mud Pill Palace* states: \"If the work is not thorough, it will not be round.\" In regulating cold and warmth, one must not be deceived by external influences. As Master Ziyang said: \"Adjust the fire’s timing, entrusting it to yin and yang.\"\n\nThis cycle continues through the twelve nodes, beginning anew each time, until the cinnabar draws out the lead, the lead is nearly exhausted, and the mercury dries. The seven *po* are dead, the *hun* transformed—this is the moment when the thread of life is about to snap, when the *hun* and *po* are on the verge of departure. Yet at this very juncture, the color shifts to that of the returning elixir: radiant purple-gold and crimson.\n\nWhen powdered and lifted, a single grain—no larger than a millet seed, as light as the seven *daogui*—is most wondrous. Its divine efficacy defies description. This chapter exhaustively describes the work of beginning the practice, yet the subtle and profound precautions must be transmitted orally by a master.

      "translated_text": "Jia Maoxiang of former worthies longed to hear the utmost Dao but, lacking a teacher’s guidance, devoted himself passionately to this book. In his declining years, in a letter replying to Minister Cai, he wrote: “The *Cantong qi* was never intended to elucidate the *Book of Changes*; it merely borrowed the method of ‘lodging stems within hexagrams’ to convey the timing of advance and retreat in practice.” Yet even one as learned as Master Zhu, without a teacher’s instruction, mistook it for a method of “lodging stems.” How could he know that this book directly expounds the Dao of the *Zhou Changes*? Thus it is called *The Seal of the Three in Accord with the Zhou Changes*. Moreover, the timing of advance and retreat in the practice of the elixir Way does not employ the method of “lodging stems.”\n\nElsewhere he wrote: “On the road, I carried no other books, and thus was able to study and become thoroughly familiar with the *Cantong qi*. I could roughly grasp its literary meaning, for though I had read it many times before, I had always found it tasteless and set it aside. Only now have I begun to discern its thread. Yet I have not yet understood its ingredients or cavities.” The profound words of the mysterious are unfathomable and beyond conception. Master Zhu repeatedly found it tasteless and cast it aside, while blind teachers insist on guessing at its meaning. He also wrote: “In the past, whenever I wished to study it, I could not find its gateway or where to begin. If even sages and worthies require a teacher, how could one like me, sharing the same wisdom as Confucius and Mencius, presume to proceed without one? Today, people are self-satisfied, recklessly guessing and acting. Compared to the former worthies, their transgressions are many indeed.”\n\nHad Master Zhu received a teacher’s instruction, he would surely have understood that the sagely Dao of the *Book of Changes* is not merely a book of divination.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: The Natures of Water and Fire**\n\nExpounding the numbers of the Five Phases, it is concise yet not verbose. Water excites fire, and suddenly the light is extinguished. The sun and moon mutually eclipse, always at the new and full moons. When water flourishes, *kan* encroaches upon yang; when fire wanes, *li* darkens the day. Yin and yang consume each other, and their mutual interaction is the natural Dao. “Name” is used to define *qing*; “character” is used to speak of *xing*. When metal comes to return to *xing* in its initial state, only then is it called the Returned Elixir. I dare not speak falsely, but follow the words of the sages. The ancient records speak of the *Dragon and Tiger*, the Yellow Emperor’s *Golden Flower*, Huainan’s *Refinement of Autumn Stone*, and Yuyang’s *Yellow Sprout*. The worthy may practice it; the unworthy should not partake. From ancient times to the present, the Dao arises from a single pair. In discourse, scholars must strive diligently, ponder deeply, and hold fast to the essential. The words are utterly clear and do not deceive me.\n\nThe numbers of the Five Phases—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth—are extended to the numbers three, five, and one. In refining the golden elixir, lead, mercury, silver, cinnabar, and earth are taken as the Five Phases and matched with yin and yang. That water can extinguish fire means that yin can dissolve yang. The mutual eclipsing of the sun and moon must occur at the new and full moons, where the waxing and waning of yin and yang encroach upon each other. If yin and yang harmonize and mutually consume one another, then naturally there arises the Dao of their interaction.\n\nMetal and water share the name *qing*; wood and fire share the character *xing*. *Qing* resides in the northwest; *xing* governs the southeast. The southeast is called “self”; the northwest is called “other.” The *qing* of metal and water naturally comes from without to overcome wood and fire. The *xing* of wood and fire inwardly returns to congeal the golden elixir. This is what is meant by “when metal comes to return to *xing* in its initial state, only then is it called the Returned Elixir.” These two lines are the marrow of the *Cantong qi*.\n\nI dare not speak falsely but follow the words of the sages. The immortal elder obtained the true transmission of the sages and also acquired the ancient text of the *Dragon and Tiger Classic*. Practicing refinement according to its method, he attained the elixir and composed this book to instruct later generations. He recounted the Yellow Emperor’s attainment of the elixir as the *Golden Flower*, Huainan’s attainment as *Autumn Stone*, and Yuyang’s attainment as the *Yellow Sprout*. Each, upon ascending, established a name—yet all were this Returned Elixir, all were the primordial unity of qi, all were the same substance.\n\nLater people, hearing of the *Golden Flower*, guessed it to be the five metals; hearing of the *Yellow Sprout*, guessed it to be the eight minerals; hearing of *Autumn Stone*, guessed it to be urine and excrement. How could they know that the ancient sages and former worthies established these names as expedient means? The elixir they refined emerges from nothing beyond yin and yang—there is no other path. This Dao can only be diligently practiced by sages. From ancient times to the present, it has been a single Way. The great sages of the Three Teachings must be of the same kind to apply their efforts. Thus it is said: “From ancient times to the present, the Dao arises from a single pair in discourse and planning.” Beyond this one path, there is no other method. Those who come after must strive diligently, ponder deeply, and seek a teacher’s instruction. Then they will know that this book is utterly clear and does not deceive.\n\nShangyang said: “The three chapters of the *Cantong qi* are distinct in substance and function, their efficacy wondrous and not trifling. *Can* refers to the substance of Heaven and Earth’s creative transformation; *tong* draws upon the same source of generation and completion; *qi* unites the efficacy of creative transformation and generation. The upper chapter recounts the beginning and end of elixir refinement; the middle chapter arranges its subtle and profound precautions; the lower chapter supplements omissions and lost correspondences. The upper chapter corresponds in meaning to the *Dragon and Tiger Upper Classic*, and the world doubts that the *Dragon and Tiger Classic* must have been composed later, taking the upper chapter of the *Cantong qi* as its classic. Yet it must also have had middle and lower classics. Without middle and lower classics, how could it be called an upper classic? The mind of the sage is not something the common people can fathom. The upper classic is the first classic—this is certainly not something the ordinary can measure. Moreover, the book contains the phrase ‘ancient record of the *Dragon and Tiger*,’ which clarifies that it is an ancient text. What doubt remains? Thus it is said: ‘The ancient text in gold and jade.’”\n\nThe Realized Person Peng Xiao’s preface states: “I do not know from whom the immortal elder received instruction, but he obtained the ancient text of the *Dragon and Tiger Classic* and fully grasped its wondrous transmission. He then condensed the *Book of Changes* to compose the three chapters of the *Cantong qi*. Yet, not having exhausted its finest subtleties, he further wrote *Supplementing Omissions and Rectifying Errors* to elaborate the profound mysteries of the elixir classics.” It is said that the immortal elder first received the transmission from the Realized Person Yin Changsheng, then later studied under Attendant Xu. Thus he fully mastered the profound mysteries of the immortal transmission. The *True One* records in detail that after completing the book, he secretly transmitted it to Attendant Xu of Qingzhou. Xu’s given name was *You*, and he annotated it. Thus the source and flow are true—what need is there to debate it? There are over a hundred commentaries on this book, but only those by Peng Xiao and Wang Dao are superior. Peng Xiao received the transmission from his teacher, and his *Bright Mirror Diagram* and preface to the *Cantong qi* are already detailed and clear. Yet his commentary on this book remains fragmented, giving rise to the saying: “Ditches and streams flow in different directions; beauty and ugliness arise in turn.” Wang Dao’s explanations are even more vast and barren.\n\nNow, the *Dragon and Tiger Classic*’s language, though lofty and ancient, is not as clear and decisive as the *Cantong qi*. Its words are profound and wondrous—without the sagely teacher’s precise instructions on where to begin, who would dare conjecture? Following “when metal comes to return to *xing* in its initial state, only then is it called the Returned Elixir,” it immediately states: “I dare not speak falsely but follow the words of the sages.” From this, we know that the ancient sages and great worthies, without a teacher, would not dare speak falsely. Without a teacher, how could this book have been composed? Without a teacher, how could one harmonize with creative transformation?",

Without this book, all would turn to heterodox paths and deviant byways, where blind masters and vulgar charlatans fabricate empty marvels, leading and dragging one another into hell. Without this book, there would be no path of cultivation between Heaven and Earth, no Dao of the sages. How then could one aspire to the ceaseless progress of all under Heaven? Reflect deeply upon this, and the immortal elder’s intent will be as clear as Heaven itself.\n\nIn general, to annotate a book is to elucidate it. Since its profound mysteries are difficult to perceive, explanations are offered to enlighten later generations. Thus, one must grasp the book’s original meaning, surpass the mental constraints of predecessors, and achieve luminous clarity—only then can the annotations surpass the original text. Otherwise, one place remains obscure, another unresolved, and instead of guiding future learners, one obstructs their wisdom, narrowing their vision and hearing. Do not assume that those who come later are inferior to those of today. If Heaven were to raise a sage or worthy to rectify and rescue the age, they would be mired in turbidity, unable to distinguish purity or restore correctness.\n\nAmong other scriptures, few compare to this book.

Its lofty composition and profound, hidden mysteries admit no carelessness in even a single word—how much more so for the wondrous methods of the Golden Elixir, the crucible’s cavities, and their functions? Yet Boyang encapsulated all with the single phrase, “when metal comes to return to *xing* in its initial state.” The Song Confucians, failing to comprehend, refused to clarify the *Zhouyi*’s Dao, reducing it entirely to a book of divination. They obscured the sagely minds of Fuxi, King Wen, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius, dimmed the *Qian* and *Kun* hexagrams’ principles of natural generation and reversal, and wrongly constrained Boyang’s meticulous transmission of the profound truth. If we do not now reveal some of its key apertures, the intentions of the Four Sages will remain unfulfilled for ten thousand generations, and the *Zhouyi*’s Dao will never be illuminated.

      "translated_text": "The *Qian* and *Kun* unite in hard and soft, embracing one another—yang holds while yin receives, male and female mutually dependent, thereby generating the essence of creation. Then *Kan* and *Li* rise to the fore, their radiance spreading forth, profound and unfathomable, beyond all depiction. The sage measures and arranges them in order, tracing back to the primordial foundation. These four intermingle, entering directly into the formless void. The sixty hexagrams unfold in a vast expanse, serving as the chariot; the dragon and horse are harnessed, and the enlightened ruler takes the reins. When times are harmonious, one follows the level path, for crooked ways are perilous and treacherous, endangering the state.\n\nThe first fifteen chapters of the *Upper Scroll* have already clarified the sequence of elixir refinement from beginning to end. This section revisits its subtleties, enumerating them chapter by chapter—this is the convergence of the Nine Returns Great Elixir, the essential application for later learners. One must delve deeply and comprehend thoroughly; hesitation or carelessness risks even the slightest deviation, and the elixir will not form. Master Shangyang divided this *Middle Scroll* into fifteen chapters, enumerating fifteen matters. This chapter alone elucidates the fourfold essence of yin and yang.\n\nWhat are these four? *Qian* is the firm principle, *Kun* the yielding. Confucius’ *Wings* states: *Qian* is the yang thing, *Kun* the yin thing. Yin and yang unite in virtue, and hard and soft take form, embodying the workings of Heaven and Earth, penetrating the power of the numinous. Thus, the virtue of *Qian* is firm, strong, centered, upright, and the pure essence of unalloyed yang. The virtue of *Kun* is soft, compliant, beneficial, and steadfast—this is the path the noble person follows. *Qian* and *Kun* in union are the Dao of the Golden Elixir. Only the noble person can follow this path; the petty person does the opposite. Formerly, Confucius said: “I have never seen a truly firm person.” Someone replied: “Shen Cheng is firm.” Confucius said: “Cheng is full of desire—how can he be firm?” The meaning of firmness is truly great.",

      "translated_text": "Alas! The petty person may force himself to be firm and strong for a time, yet how can he be centered and upright? If he cannot be centered and upright, how can his essence be pure? Now, firmness is the nature of *Qian*—it moves directly, thus is easily known. Softness is the nature of *Kun*—it moves by yielding, thus is easily followed. What is easily known gains affinity; what is easily followed achieves success. With affinity and success, greatness and endurance are possible—this is the virtue and work of the sage. Can one attain position through this? Is this not the Dao of the Golden Elixir, the mean between firmness and softness?\n\nThus, the virtue of *Qian* yang governs bestowal, while the virtue of *Kun* yin specializes in containment and receptivity. Male and female depend on each other, relying on essence and *qi*. When essence and *qi* spread forth, the *Wings* say: essence and *qi* are things; the wandering soul is transformation. As things, they follow the natural course to generate life—this is the birth of humans and all beings. As transformation, they are employed in reverse to achieve accomplishment—this is the making of Buddhas and immortals.\n\nWhat are *Kan* and *Li* at the head? When *Qian* the firm intermingles with *Kun*, *Qian* becomes hollow at its center and transforms into *Li*. When *Kun* the soft receives *Qian*, *Kun* becomes replete within and transforms into *Kan*. Thus, *Kan* and *Li* follow *Qian* and *Kun*, standing at the forefront of yin and yang, attaining the mean of firmness and softness. *Li* holds the sun’s light at its center; *Kan* holds the moon’s radiance. Their luminous brilliance descends below, profound and subtle, beyond measure, beyond depiction. Only the sage can fathom and expound their primal foundation. This meaning aligns with the earlier discussion of primordial essence—both are abstruse and difficult to gauge, their effects verified by signs.\n\nWhat are the four—yin, yang, essence, and *qi*—intermingled in chaos? These four are contained within the aperture of emptiness, then unfold as the sixty-four hexagrams, spreading forth as a chariot. *Kun* is the ox, the chariot; *Qian* is the dragon, the horse. When *Qian* and *Kun* unite in virtue, dragon and horse are harnessed, and the world attains peace under the bright ruler’s governance. The Golden Fluid Returned Elixir shares this same Dao. Why? The dragon is the water of the eastern direction; the horse is the cinnabar fire of the south. When dragon and horse obtain the metal tiger of the west to generate the *xuanwu* water of the north, essence and *qi* congeal into form, and the harnessing is complete.\n\nHarmony ensures smooth travel without deviation—this is the bright ruler’s governance, moving along the great road without burdening the people. If harmony follows the seasons, all responds accordingly. Should one stray from the right path, resorting to deceit to obstruct the worthy and envy the capable, the state will be imperiled. Thus, when the nine ministers of old departed, loyal ministers advanced, and the An Lushan rebellion began to sprout. When Qin Hui was employed, Yue Fei perished, and the lands of Yan and Yun were never reclaimed. Those who exert themselves for the state fear only that power may not rest with the ruler; petty persons, acting for themselves, fear only that authority may not belong to them.\n\nIn every age, noble persons and petty persons coexist. When the noble person harmonizes and accommodates the petty, and the petty follows and submits to the noble, the state avoids peril, and the world is well-governed. In cultivation, harmony comes first. With harmony, all affairs follow the heart’s intent and respond accordingly. The *Wings* say: “The auspiciousness of *Dui* lies in action without doubt.” Once affairs are harmonized, the heart must be rectified, intentions made sincere, and vigilance maintained against peril. Then, no obstacles will lead to ruin, and the Elixir will not fail. Can one afford not to be cautious of even the slightest deviation?\n\nThe following twenty-eight chapters further elucidate these four matters in greater detail.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: The Noble Person Dwelling in His Chamber**\nWhen the noble person dwells in his chamber and utters good words, they resonate a thousand *li* away. How much more so for those nearby? The ruler of ten thousand chariots, abiding in his ninefold chamber, issues decrees and commands in accord with yin and yang, storing his instruments and awaiting the proper time without transgression. The hexagram *Zhun* corresponds to the months of *zi* and *shen*, while *Meng* aligns with *yin* and *xu*. The remaining sixty hexagrams each have their appointed days. Here, two images are briefly presented, though their full intricacies cannot be exhaustively explored. When establishing intentions and enacting punishments, benevolence is applied and virtue bestowed. To oppose this brings misfortune; to follow it brings fortune.\n\nAccording to the calendar, when decrees are issued with utmost sincerity, close attention must be paid to the celestial stems and earthly branches, carefully observing waxing and waning. Even the slightest deviation brings regret and harm. At the solstices, the measurements change; errors and distortions accumulate. In the depths of winter, scorching heat; in the height of summer, frost and snow. At the equinoxes, imbalance reigns—timekeeping falters, drought and flood contend, wind and rain fail to follow their seasons, locusts surge forth, and myriad anomalies emerge. Heaven displays its omens; mountains collapse and the earth splits. The filial son’s concentrated mind moves the August Ultimate. Nearby, his words issue from his own mouth; afar, they flow into distant lands—sometimes summoning calamity, sometimes bringing fortune, sometimes creating great peace, sometimes inciting war. These four outcomes arise from this.\n\nWithin the breast, movement and stillness have their constancy, adhering to the marking line. The four seasons follow their proper order, harmonizing with *qi*. Firmness and softness are balanced, not encroaching upon one another. The five phases guard their boundaries, neither recklessly expanding nor contracting. The *Yi* circulates freely, bending and extending, returning and reversing.\n\nThis chapter is most crucial for the initial precautions when entering the chamber—meticulous and subtle are the wonders of Elixir refinement. The sage uses the noble person as a metaphor. The *Appended Judgments* of the *Yi* states: “When the noble person dwells in his chamber and utters good words, they resonate a thousand *li* away—how much more so for those nearby?” It also says: “Words and actions are the noble person’s hinge and trigger. The release of hinge and trigger determines honor and disgrace. Words and actions are how the noble person moves Heaven and Earth.” Further: “One deliberates before speaking, discusses before acting. Deliberation and discussion bring about transformation.”\n\nMaster Shangyang says: The Dao is fundamentally wordless—without words, how could it be revealed? To speak of the wordless refers to the virtuous person, whose words cannot be careless. How much more so for those who practice the Dao and refine the Elixir? Laozi says: “The knowing do not speak; the speaking do not know.” Those who flaunt dry wisdom and lack true knowledge—when they expound and debate, they seek only to be known. A true teacher can discern their deceit and shallowness, and such vessels will not lightly discuss the Purple Yang’s teachings. Master Ziyang says: “Even with cauldrons before me and blades at my neck, I dare not speak.” If this is the case for one truly practicing the Dao, how can one not speak? Yet when entering the chamber to gather the medicine, one must avoid careless words. If one does not speak at all, how can the medicine’s authenticity be ascertained?\n\nNiwan says: “If words do not communicate, they are not kin; if the work is not done, it is not round.” The Immortal Elder cites the words of sages and immortals, then elaborates: This refers to the ruler of ten thousand chariots, abiding in his ninefold chamber, issuing decrees and commands in accord with yin and yang’s rhythms. In seeking the Elixir, one must follow yin and yang’s seasons and timeliness—this is the moment when the solitary yang returns. Store your instruments and await the proper time without transgression. The hexagram and month refer to gathering the medicine when the moon appears, at *Zhen*’s arising—this is the time when the third day yields to *geng*. *Zhun* corresponds to *zi* and *shen*, the flourishing of water’s vitality; *Meng* aligns with *yin* and *xu*, the storage of fire’s power. Each of the sixty hexagrams has its appointed day. Here, two hexagrams—*Zhun* and *Meng*—are briefly presented, though their full intricacies cannot be exhaustively explored.\n\nThe Immortal Elder humbly states that he has not fully plumbed their depths, for the profound mysteries must be transmitted orally. The scriptures say: “These are not ordinary words of the world.” One hopes that those who have already attained the truth will thoroughly investigate the subtle and comprehend their meaning. This statement—“cannot be exhaustively explored”—implies that without the innate capacity of a supreme sage, how could one practice this Dao and become a true person?",

      "translated_text": "Establishing principles and enacting punishments serves to prevent deceit; acting with benevolence and bestowing virtue serves to guide the heart toward joy. Those who defy these are met with misfortune, while those who follow them attain good fortune. According to the laws and calendrical reckonings, decrees must be issued with utmost sincerity, and actions must be single-minded and discreet.\n\nIn vigilant observation of the days: one year is contained within one month, one month within a single day, one day within a single hour, and one hour employs but one talisman. In scrutinizing the waxing and waning, one must discern the clarity and turbidity of the water born of *dui* metal, along with its precise proportions. Should there be even the slightest deviation—no matter how minute or seemingly insignificant—it will inevitably invite blame, adversity, and harm to the elixir furnace. Such errors lead to the misalignment of yin and yang, causing the solstices to reverse: midwinter becomes scorching summer, midsummer yields bitter frost, and the spring and autumn equinoxes lose their balance, with dawn and dusk, hours and clepsydra marks no longer corresponding. Rain and sunshine falter, omens and anomalies multiply, and all these portents of misfortune arise from a single misstep in tending the furnace, cascading into a hundred errors. All stem from the failure of the alchemical work, yet fools do not blame themselves but instead resent the elixir classics.\n\nOnly those with a steadfast and sincere heart, who reflect and repent with genuine remorse, redoubling their diligence and perseverance without retreat, may attain communion with Heaven. Divine aid will then be granted, and success in the endeavor assured. This is akin to the filial child whose sincerity moves the imperial heart: the heart is the root of spirit, and when the heart is true, the numinous naturally responds. Words are the voice of the heart—when auspicious, they resonate with nature and temperament; though uttered by oneself, their echoes reach far. Failure invites calamity, while success brings blessing. Deviation leads to strife, while fulfillment brings joy and great peace. These four outcomes—failure, success, deviation, and fulfillment—all arise from the human heart. When movement and stillness are not reckless but adhere to the plumb line, the four seasons align in harmony, the five phases balance, and the Dao of the *Yi* circulates and returns without obstruction.\n\nThe above analogies urge those who cultivate the elixir to concentrate their minds, remain vigilant against peril, and guard against negligence. For this elixir Way depends not solely on oneself but also on Heaven. If Heaven is even slightly opposed, one must move it with treasures and sincerity, never acting contrary to the Heavenly Dao. Only by aligning with the Heavenly Dao can the golden elixir be achieved.\n\nThus, the hexagram *Tongren* first wails and then laughs. The *Wings* says: \"The Way of the noble one may emerge or withdraw, may be silent or speak. When two hearts are as one, their sharpness is like a sword; their words, like a shared fragrance, are as the orchid.\" *Tongren* is the hexagram of those with a shared heart. In it, one yin line is surrounded by five yang lines. When yin is abundant and yang scarce, yang governs; when yang is abundant and yin scarce, yin governs. Thus, *Tongren* unites the solitary yin with the venerable yang. To attain the shared heart of *Tongren*, one must bind it with mutual benefit, only then can the words of *Tongren* be realized. Therefore, the noble one is discreet and accommodating, never speaking recklessly but using words as a means to an end. Given the difficulty of achieving the elixir Way, how could one not comply with reverence and caution?\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: The Union of Dark and New Moons**\n\nBetween the dark and new moons, the talismans unite, and the primordial chaos of *hongmeng* flows. The female and male follow one another, their essences moistening and nourishing, their transformations circulating without bound. The spirits of Heaven and Earth cannot fathom their measure. This process secures the body, conceals the form, and begins in the northeast, the region of *Ji* and *Dou*. Turning rightward, it revolves, sprouting buds, and in the hidden depths, images emerge, scattering radiant light above *Mao* and *Bi*. The trigram *Zhen* arises as the first sign of yang’s inception. The first nine is the hidden dragon; yang is established with three, yin with eight. After three days, *Zhen* stirs; after eight days, *Dui* moves. The second nine is the visible dragon, peaceful and luminous. The virtues of three and five coalesce, forming the body of *Qian*. The third nine, vigilant at dusk, refines the spirit talisman; its waxing and waning gradually transform until it returns to its origin. *Xun* governs its constancy, holding fast to its course. The fourth nine may leap forward or retreat, its path perilous. *Gen* governs advance and withdrawal, never exceeding its time—twenty-three days to uphold the appointed term. The fifth nine is the flying dragon in the celestial position, adorned with excellence. The sixth five is *Kun*, receiving and binding, nurturing all beings as the eternal mother. The ninth is the exalted dragon, battling virtue in the wilds. With the \"nine nines,\" it soars as the compass of the Dao.\n\nYang’s numbers complete, then begin anew, emotions and nature turning to unite in cyclical motion. The jade pivot ascends and descends, circulating above and below. The six lines are difficult to perceive, for they have no fixed position—this is the ancestral principle of the *Yi*.\n\nThis chapter compares the dark and new moons of a single month to the practice of elixir refinement, where the lines of the hexagram unite with the talisman. In a year, there are twelve dark and new moons, twelve full moons. In Heaven, the Greater Yin has twelve degrees, aligning with the Greater Yang in a double ring. On Earth, the Lesser Yin has twelve degrees, corresponding to the body’s meridians—this is the proper alignment of yin and yang. Yet the Lesser Yin, vast and obscure, cannot be measured. The sage, roaming within the Supreme Ultimate, first models the union of talismans before proceeding.\n\nThus, in the prior Heaven, the Greater Yin of Heaven each month aligns with the Greater Yang. When the sun and moon unite, the moon lies below the sun, the sun above the moon. The moon receives the sun’s pure radiance, its light directed toward Heaven, unseen by human eyes. This is akin to the union of man and woman: the man above, the woman below, the woman covered by the man and thus unseen. At the dark and new moons, the moon lies beneath the sun, its light undivided—comparable to the Lesser Yin of the human realm.\n\nAt the time of the Supreme Ultimate’s chaos, within the prior Heaven’s *hongmeng*, when the talismans unite until the third day of *geng*, the subtle yang is about to arise. The yang male and yin female follow one another, their union generating moistening essences that naturally circulate and transform. The spirits of Heaven and Earth cannot fathom their measure.\n\nThe Great Dao cannot be enacted without the capacity of a sage. The *Wings* says: \"Align your virtue with Heaven and Earth, your brightness with the sun and moon, your order with the four seasons, your fortune and misfortune with ghosts and spirits.\" The numinous wonder of the golden elixir, though beyond the measure of Heaven and Earth or the divination of spirits, arises from the sage’s skill in aligning virtue with Heaven and Earth, reversing the workings of creation to generate this *qi*. The sage aligns brightness with the sun and moon, inverting effort to enact this *qi*. The sage harmonizes order with the four seasons, employing this *qi* so that cold and heat do not constrain one another. The sage subtly aligns fortune and misfortune with ghosts and spirits, completing this *qi* so that demons and gods reveal their true forms. Thus, even Heaven and Earth cannot fathom it—only the sage can.\n\nWhat does \"securing the body and concealing the form\" mean? It refers to the Way of *Kun*. The function of *Kun* lies in its palace of earth, which governs the water of *Kan*. The virtue of water is to benefit all things without contention.",

      "translated_text": "The sage, by employing it in reverse, attains the benefits of water. The utility of the *Yi* lies in its sixfold application; \"perpetual correctness\" is the virtue of *Kun*. It begins in the northeast, in the region of the Dipper and Winnowing Basket—what does this mean? Each new moon, the moon and sun necessarily meet in the region of the Winnowing Basket and Dipper. The Winnowing Basket and Dipper belong to *Gen*; *Gen* as a hexagram signifies yin encroaching upon yang. It is called the \"demon’s path,\" for each month, when the moon reaches this region, it loses its brightness. Thus it is said, \"losing one’s companions.\" This resembles the way people follow the five phases in sequence, experiencing birth, aging, illness, and death, as cold and heat alternate in succession.\n\nWhen the heavens rotate to the right, the sun, moon, and stars all turn to the right. When the moon reaches this region, it must darken and conceal itself, appearing like a jade tablet or a ritual scepter. On the first and second days, as it rotates to the right toward the *geng* direction, its essence and light begin to emerge, and its spirit is born. By the time of the Pleiades and the Hyades, the moon borrows the sun’s light, which shines forth below like the first yang of *Gan* rising beneath *Kun*, forming the image of *Zhen*. On the third evening, one yang and two yins—*Gan*’s eldest son—attains its time and enacts the Way, hence \"the third day brings *Zhen*’s movement.\"\n\nOn the eighth day, the upper *kan* appears: one yin and one yang, *Kun*’s youngest daughter, *Dui*, receives the fire of *ding* and temporarily enacts *Kun*’s Way to preside over affairs. Yin and yang harmonize, and spirits are born—thus it is said, \"on the eighth day, *Dui* acts.\" At the full moon of the fifteenth, the moon is wholly yang and radiant—thus it is said, \"on the fifteenth, virtue is perfected, and the *Gan* body is complete.\" This resembles the upper line of the hexagram, akin to the golden elixir already formed within the crucible, where water and metal of the Great Yin reflect the sun to generate essence and spirit. The human body mirrors the moon to produce the golden elixir; within the crucible, the elixir is present. One must remain vigilant as if facing peril, cautious when full, and fearful of decline when at its peak. Only the sage can maintain vigilance from beginning to end, allowing *Xun* to continue the lineage, firmly securing and carefully nurturing it. Gradually circulating the yin tally to envelop the yang *qi*, *Gen* governs advance and retreat. When the tally is full, the lower *kan* gradually congeals and solidifies. Heaven’s position is attained with joy; one draws forth lead and mercury. When lead is exhausted, mercury dries; at six-five, *Kun* receives and binds, encompassing beginning and end. Lead and mercury both transform into the golden elixir, which is now complete. Though one month is used as a metaphor for its practice, the essential work requires ten months to approximate the formation of the body. When the work is complete, three years suffice; when the merit is lofty, twelve years are needed. It depends on the practitioner’s accumulated conduct.\n\nIf a great sage were to recreate yin and yang, aligning emotion with nature and turning them to establish a separate elixir furnace, forging the Nine Cauldrons’ great elixir, it would resemble the celestial sphere being reestablished at *zi*. Comparing the twelve lines to a single month, from darkness to the new moon, the new moon reaches dawn, and the first yang stirs again in the *Fu* hexagram. Thus it is said, \"there is no fixed position, for this is the ancestral origin of the *Yi*.\"\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: The Function of Hexagram Changes**\n\nAt the new moon’s dawn, *Fu* appears: yang *qi* begins to flow, entering and exiting without hindrance. Erecting a subtle marker of firmness, the Yellow Bell’s pitch is established in *zi*, heralding the flourishing of all things. The initial stirring of yang *qi* spreads warmth and gentle nurturance, allowing the masses to return to constancy. *Lin* governs the furnace, extending its branches to open the path, rectifying the light so it gradually advances and daily grows. In *chou*, the Great Frame is established, its low and high positions forming *Tai*. Firmness and softness both prosper; yin and yang unite, the small departing and the great arriving, converging in *yin* as the time advances. Passing through *Da Zhuang*, it arrays itself at the gate of *mao*, where elm pods fall and return to their root. Punishment and virtue alternate; day and night begin to divide. In *Guai*, yin retreats as yang ascends, washing and cleansing the wings to shake off the dust of the past. In *qian*, yang reaches its zenith at midday, and *Gou* begins its sequence. Treading frost comes first; the coldest spring lies at the well’s bottom. At *wu*, the guest is the *kan* trigram, while the host is yin. One withdraws from the world, relinquishing position to gather essence, cherishing virtue while awaiting the time. Lingering in obscurity, *Pi* blocks all passage; what sprouts cannot grow. Yin extends while yang recedes, its name and form vanishing. Observing its power and measuring its weight, one entrusts the young and tender to the autumn’s harvest. The old and withered revive; shepherd’s purse and wheat sprout anew. Under cover, they grow; in *Bo*, the limbs rot and the form diminishes. When the transformative *qi* is exhausted and lost, the spirit’s path is cut off, and it returns to *Kun*’s origin. Abiding in earth’s principle, it bears Heaven’s mandate, spreading and proclaiming the profound and distant, connecting what is remote and obstructed. Responding to the measure, it nurtures the seeds of yin and yang’s origin. Vast and indistinct, none know its beginning. Those who lose the track first become lost; later, they become the master. Without levelness, there is no slope—this is the Way’s natural transformation. Flourishing and decline alternate, mutually dependent. In the end, *Kun* returns to *Fu*, like a linked ring. Emperors and kings inherit and govern for a thousand generations, ever enduring.\n\nThe previous chapter described the waxing and waning of a single month as the image of refining the elixir to completion. This chapter compares the work of the twelve months to the image of its practice. The initial attainment of the elixir corresponds to the *Fu* hexagram—*Fu* being one yang hidden beneath five yins.\n\nSages and worthies who practice this Way ascend beyond the ordinary to become sages; wicked people who practice it lose their lives and forfeit their bodies. King Wen said, \"Companions arrive without blame; the Way returns after seven days—it is beneficial to have somewhere to go.\" \"Companions arrive\" means companions come from afar. \"Without blame\" means there is benefit without harm. \"The Way returns after seven days\" refers to the practice of the *Yi*’s Way—enacting it in reverse. \"Seven days to return\" means the moon conceals its light for seven days before shining again, just as in humans. After seven days of movement, yang begins to stir. \"Beneficial to have somewhere to go\" means advancing virtuously without loss. The *Eastern Capital Rhapsody* says, \"The sun and moon are concealed at the Dragon’s Tail\" (the Tail being the star at the end of the Dipper). This refers to yang’s imminent return. Confucius said, \"In *Fu*, one sees the heart of Heaven and Earth.\" The world does not know the heart of Heaven and Earth; Laozi called it the \"gate of the Mysterious Female,\" while Master Fang referred to it as the \"gate of life and door of death.\" The *Yi* says, \"Thunder lies within the earth—*Fu*. The former kings, on this day, closed the passes; merchants and travelers did not journey, and lords did not inspect their domains.\" Thunder is firm yang; earth is soft yin. With firm yang within soft yin, one revives the *qi* of prior Heaven. The former kings practiced this Way on this day, closing the passes and not inspecting their domains to focus their minds and devote themselves wholeheartedly. Merchants and travelers represent miscellaneous distractions; not journeying means cutting off such distractions to practice the Way single-mindedly. Thus the *Xiang* commentary says, \"Returning without having gone far is for cultivating the body,\" and \"The one in the middle alone returns to follow the Way.\"\n\nAt the new moon’s dawn, *Fu* appears: yang *qi* begins to flow. The sage’s heart is one. *Fu* means first concealing and then returning. The initial yang *qi* enters and exits freely, without harm. \"Erecting a subtle marker of firmness\" means *Gan* moves directly. The Yellow Bell’s pitch in the yang month of *zi* heralds the masses—the beginning of all things. The initial stirring of yang *qi* first spreads and flourishes, bestowing gentle warmth upon the masses, allowing them to return to constancy. Master Shangyang said, \"The marvel of making the elixir lies precisely here—never treat it lightly.\"",
      "overlap_context": "* so that cold and heat do not constrain one another. The sage subtly aligns fortune and misfortune with ghosts and spirits, completing this *qi* so that demons and gods reveal their true forms. Thus, even Heaven and Earth cannot fathom it—only the sage can.\n\nWhat does \"securing the body and concealing the form\" mean? It refers to the Way of *Kun*. The function of *Kun* lies in its palace of earth, which governs the water of *Kan*. The virtue of water is to benefit all things without contention.",

      "translated_text": "Having received the master’s instructions in the Dao, one must understand the Three Passes and Three Phases. Why is this so?\n\nFirst, prepare the altar and platform, then gather the medicinal ingredients. Once obtained, the ingredients circulate freely—entering and exiting, refining and cultivating. The gentle warmth spreads, bestowing subtle warmth that penetrates directly. This is the First Pass and First Phase.\n\nApproaching the alchemical furnace, apply the firing times with focused intent. The Pass opens, the path unobstructed—neither excessive nor reckless. Colors harmonize, radiance softens, growing ever lower and humbler. The *Dayu* pitch responds to the *chou* day, and the light gradually lengthens. This is the Middle Pass and Second Phase.\n\nThe *Taicu* pitch arrives, ascending to form *Tai*. *Tai* as a hexagram is earth above heaven: yin, though above, can moisten below; yang, though below, can illuminate above. Thus the *Xici* commentary says, \"The soft above and the firm below—these two *qi* interact and unite, halting yet rejoicing. The male descends, the female ascends, hence it is beneficial for divination.\" When the Five Phases are inverted, heaven and earth produce treasure. The soft acts first, enriching the other to become host; the firm acts later, and I become the guest. The male begins with a small departure, the female with a great arrival. Metal and *qi* depend on each other; yang completes the *Gan* body. Here, firmness and softness flourish together, yin and yang unite. This is the Lower Pass and Third Phase.\n\nGradually advancing through *Dazhuang*, the returning elixir coagulates. Passing through the *mao* gate, the elm pods return to their root. Punishment and virtue bear each other, day and night begin to divide. The signs of the elixir appear in the Yellow Court—guard and nurture it with care and single-mindedness. *Guai* as a hexagram is yin severing and parting; yang *qi* has already returned. The golden elixir is conceived, *Gan* robust and flourishing, metal *qi* pure yang. At the end of *si*, the movement of yin talismans begins. *Gou* receives and suddenly embraces yang, preventing its escape. Yang regains yin, and yin becomes the host. *Kun* as a hexagram: \"The first six, treading frost, the well’s bottom cold spring—yin *qi* descends.\" The sixth month gathers essence, awaiting the hour. *Pi* arrives in the seventh month: yin and yang do not communicate, yin extends while yang withdraws, yang *qi* inwardly bright. The eighth month observes the image, measures and examines autumn’s nature, nurturing the young and tender like wheat sprouts. The old withers, then revives like shepherd’s purse. Once the transformation’s *qi* is exhausted, the form dissolves. When the Dao is exhausted, it returns to *Kun*’s origin—coming and going, eternally compliant, bearing heaven.\n\nThis text is composed with profound method: some sections begin with an introduction, others conclude with a summary. Those without an introduction are summarized at the end; those without a conclusion begin with an introduction. This chapter, for instance, lacks an introduction and is thus summarized at the close. Its opening lines state: \"At the new moon’s dawn, *Fu*; *Fu* then *Lin*; *Lin* then *Tai*; *Tai* then *Dazhuang*; *Dazhuang* then *Guai*; *Guai* then *Gan*; *Gan* then *Gou*; *Gou* then *Dun*; *Dun* then *Pi*; *Pi* then *Guan*; *Guan* then *Bo*; *Bo* then *Kun*.\" The conclusion states: \"Profound, distant, subtle, and remote—separated yet connected.\" These two lines are most concise. \"Profound, distant, subtle, and remote\" refer to the two substances of yin and yang—so profound they cannot be grasped, so distant they cannot be conceived. Yet their transformative power is double that of heaven and earth. \"Separated yet connected\" means the two substances are divided by nearly ten thousand *li*, yet if the Yellow Matchmaker mediates, even the most distant becomes near.\n\nThus, when the two substances respond to measure and nurture the seed, they become the origin of yin and yang. The sage employs them to practice the Dao. Vast and indistinct, beyond grasp—yet the sage reverses their function to apply them.\n\n\"First lost, then found; later becoming the sovereign.\" The soft, compliant, beneficial, and steadfast—this is the path the noble person follows. \"First lost, then found; later attaining constancy.\" These are the words of the Ten Wings.\n\nThe Immortal Elder elaborates: \"Yin becomes the host at the end,\" and \"later becomes the sovereign\"—both refer to *Kun*’s beneficial earthly Dao.\n\n\"No level ground without slope\"—this is the Dao’s nature. Water, utterly level, pools into a deep abyss. The sloping banks do not flow; if the slope is filled, water naturally overflows. This analogy illustrates the Dao’s natural principle: change and renewal grow ever more abundant, returning to *Gan* and ceasing, then resuming with *Kun*. Thus it is said: \"Ending with *Kun*, beginning anew,\" like tracing a linked ring.\n\nEmperors and kings who govern for a thousand years endure. If they can govern by the Dao of *Qian* and *Kun*, reversing and complying, then a thousand-year lifespan is not excessive. If their merit is lofty and conduct illustrious, ascending to heaven in broad daylight is within their allotted portion. In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor first served the people, cultivating worldly blessings. In his next life, he became a minister, then an immortal, transcending the world. In his third life, he became a sovereign, then relinquished the realm, abandoning all affairs. Seeking a secluded place among mountains and waters, he found the Lord of Dinghu at Jun Mountain, where he refined the Ninefold Returning Elixir. After its completion, he ascended in broad daylight, riding a dragon.\n\nNote: Jun Mountain is Dongting Lake, where a mountain stands within the lake. Because the Yellow Emperor refined the elixir there, it is called Jun Mountain.\n\n**Chapter Twenty: Nurturing Nature to Establish Destiny**\n\nTo nurture nature and extend life, first consider the end, then deliberate on the beginning. The body one inherits is originally unified, without primordial essence. *Qi* spreads, relying on yin and yang for measure. The hun and po reside within: the yang spirit is the sun-hun, the yin spirit the moon-po. Hun and po serve as each other’s dwelling. Nature governs within, establishing boundaries; emotions operate without, constructing walls and outer defenses. When defenses are complete, people and things are at peace. At this time, emotions harmonize with *Qian* and *Kun*: *Gan* moves directly, *qi* spreads and flows; *Kun* is still, converging into the Dao. Firmness retreats, softness transforms and nourishes. Nine returns, seven reversions, eight reunions, six residences—male white, female red. Metal and fire restrain each other, then water settles and fire. The Five Phases begin with the highest good, like water—clear and flawless. The Dao’s form is the true One, difficult to depict. Changing and dispersing, each dwells alone, like a chicken’s egg: white and black aligned, a *cun* in length, the beginning of all. The four limbs, five viscera, sinews, and bones all develop, completing ten months before emerging from the womb—bones soft and pliable, flesh smooth as lead.\n\nThis chapter speaks of nurturing nature before cultivating destiny. What, then, is nature? It is *Gan*’s substance. If one can nurture it, *Gan*’s yang will not wane; essence guards within, *qi* arises without. With this, one can refine the elixir and enter sagehood. Yet people do not know that nature and destiny are one. What is this \"one\"? Some guess nature is spiritual clarity, or a lump of flesh, a stubborn heart. Others take thoughts and perceptions as nature, or the intangible, or empty nothingness. Some mistake orders for destiny. How could they know the dim and distant is destiny, or the gate of ceaseless generation and transformation? Only blind guesses and dreams—how can they reach the sage’s Dao?\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: \"Heaven is nature to humanity.\"",

      "translated_text": "The human heart is a mechanism—when a noble person obtains it, they cultivate themselves; when a petty person obtains it, they treat life lightly. Confucius said: \"Exhaust principle, fulfill nature, to reach destiny.\" Mencius said: \"Preserve the heart, nurture nature, to await Heaven’s mandate.\" Whether one dies young or lives long, remain unwavering; cultivate the self to await it—this is how destiny is established. The Dao of the sages reaches its utmost in Mencius, yet his clarity is too severe. Yi [Wing] said: \"Of old, when the sages composed the *Yijing*, they did so to accord with the principle of nature and destiny.\" Thus they established Heaven’s Dao as yin and yang, Earth’s Dao as soft and hard, and humanity’s Dao as benevolence and righteousness.\n\nThe immortals above say: \"If one cultivates nature but not destiny, how can they enter sagehood? Cultivate destiny only after cultivating nature—this is the path of practice.\" Some say the Buddhists cultivate nature while the Daoists cultivate destiny—how could there be two Ways in the world? This is none other than Mencius’ Dao of preserving the heart, nurturing nature, cultivating the self, and establishing destiny. To establish destiny, one must first nurture nature; without awakening to nature, how can one know destiny? Thus the *Zhongyong* says: \"What Heaven commands is called nature; following nature is called the Dao.\" Therefore, the sage has no dual heart.\n\nThis is to say: if one wishes to nurture nature and prolong life, one must first make the world understand what it means to nurture nature. Dongbin thus used elixir refinement to illustrate it, yet they did not know what it means to establish destiny. Zhang and Xu thus used elixir refinement as a metaphor. \"Only essence, only unity—hold fast to the center\": this is nurturing nature. \"When male and female unite in essence, the myriad things transform and generate\": this is establishing destiny. \"Accumulating essence, amassing *qi*\": this is nurturing nature. \"Flowing *wu* to join *si*\": this is establishing destiny.\n\nThose who reflect on beginnings and ends—people rely on their cleverness, clinging to bias without turning back, saying: \"Since there is birth, there must be death—how could there be longevity?\" Yet sages, immortals, and buddhas are all born of Heaven—how could a teacher grant it to others? How could they achieve this without reflection? Those who willingly accept death should first consider: consider, that is, reflect. Reflect on where this body comes from. If one says it is born of the *qi* of parents’ yin and yang, then the *qi* of yin and yang must be able to prolong life and must be able to perfect one as a buddha or immortal. Thus refining the great elixir is no different from the moment of receiving *qi* at birth—only the direction differs.\n\nConfucius said: \"Not knowing life, how can one know death?\" The sages clarify the causes of life and death in nature and destiny, demonstrating the Dao of yin and yang—why the difference between reversal and compliance. That which complies to generate beings is humanity; that which reverses to generate the elixir is sagehood. This is called: \"Original essence spreads like clouds, relying on *qi* at the beginning.\" What is meant by yin and yang as measure? The dwelling of hun and po. Yin and yang take hun and po as their substance; hun and po rely on yin and yang as their vessel. When separated, *li* is the sun’s hun, *kan* is the moon’s po. The yang within yin is *wu* earth, which governs the hun; the yin within yang is *si* earth, which governs the po. Hun and po mutually serve as chambers; yin and yang interflow.\n\nNature governs the solid essence within, establishing the firm barrier; emotion governs the subdued *qi* without, building the outer wall. What is the wall? The encasing of the *Chenghua*. What is the outer wall?",
      "overlap_context": "ople do not know that nature and destiny are one. What is this \"one\"? Some guess nature is spiritual clarity, or a lump of flesh, a stubborn heart. Others take thoughts and perceptions as nature, or the intangible, or empty nothingness. Some mistake orders for destiny. How could they know the dim and distant is destiny, or the gate of ceaseless generation and transformation? Only blind guesses and dreams—how can they reach the sage’s Dao?\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: \"Heaven is nature to humanity.\"",

The firm and straight, once applied, then retreat; the soft and yielding spread moisture to nourish the elixir, born within the crucible, returning to accomplish the work.\n\nWhat is called the \"Nine Returns\": earth’s four generates metal, heaven’s nine completes silver. Dragon and tiger intertwine, the *qi* of metal and silver returns once more to the crucible—thus it is called the Nine Returns. The \"Seven Reversions\": earth’s two generates fire, heaven’s seven completes cinnabar. Hun and po yearn for each other, the essence of cinnabar and fire reflects back into the crucible—thus it is called the Seven Reversions. The \"Eight Returns\": heaven’s three generates wood, earth’s eight completes mercury. The true of *wu* and *si* unites, wood’s essence returns to the refining crucible—thus it is called the Eight Returns. The \"Six Residings\": heaven’s one generates water, earth’s six completes lead.

      "translated_text": "The black and white in alignment signify the union of yin and yang. A span of one *cun* in length marks the initial formation of the Elixir, as minute as a grain of millet. Gradually, this span expands, not merely filling the Spirit Chamber but suffusing warmth throughout the four limbs, moistening the five viscera, and invigorating sinews and bones—all become harmoniously smooth. After ten months of work, the Elixir takes form, shedding its fetal husk, and is called the Yang Spirit. The image of the Yang Spirit is the *qi* of primordial origin, congealed into bone—pliable as if rolled, its flesh smooth as lead powder, unlike the *qi* and blood of later heaven that form human beings, whose bones are heavy and flesh turbid, incapable of transformation. The flesh is smooth as lead, and lead is akin to powder, also called \"lead powder\" (commonly known as water powder, white, soft, and smooth, used by women to adorn their faces, enhancing their radiance). How much more so, then, is this Yang Spirit the true lead *qi* of primordial origin, coagulated into form?\n\nThis corresponds to the nurturing described in Chapter Six. In Chapter Twenty-One, \"The Mutual Transformation of the Two Qi,\" the yang burning-mirror does not generate light without the sun, nor can the fangzhu vessel yield water without the stars and moon. If even distant and subtle *qi* can resonate and transform, how much more so the intimate proximity of true yin and true yang within the heart and chest? Yin and yang pair as the sun and moon, water and fire manifest their effects.\n\nThe yang burning-mirror is a yang object, containing *qi* within, thus it can evoke fire from the sun. The fangzhu is a yin object, containing essence within, thus it can evoke water from the moon. Though the sun and moon hang high in the heavens and the burning-mirror and fangzhu are exceedingly subtle, the two *qi* of yin and yang still mutually transform. How much more so within the human body, where true yin and true yang reside intimately in the heart and chest, near and easily sought—how could they fail to resonate and transform? The fault lies with later people who have not grasped the Way.\n\nThe yin and yang of the human body may be likened to the sun and moon in the sky, and the water and fire of various mirrors may be compared to the essence and *qi* within the body. Even inanimate objects resonate thus; how much more so beings with consciousness and spirit naturally interact? Among all things between heaven and earth, humans are the most numinous. Even the basest and most foolish know the principle of yin and yang’s transformative nurturing without needing instruction to act accordingly. Yet all the foolish and deluded only know the forward course that generates beings; as for the reverse application—this is the path of refining essence and subduing *qi* to form the Elixir, which no teacher imparts. This chapter simply elucidates how the two *qi* of yin and yang resonate and transform to accomplish creation.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: The Three Treasures as the Key**\nClose the three treasures of ear, eye, and mouth; no leakage may occur. The Perfected One lurks in the deep abyss, floating and roaming, guarding the compass’s center. Twisting and turning to see and hear, opening and closing in perfect accord, these become the pivot of the self. In movement and stillness, never exhausted, the *qi* within the *li* and *kan* nurtures and protects. The *kan* does not employ hearing, the *dui* does not engage in speech—few words follow the vast primordial chaos. Once the three are sealed, relax the body in an empty chamber, commit the will to emptiness, and take non-thought as the constant. Though difficult to verify and shift, the heart remains focused, never straying. In sleep, the spirit embraces; upon waking, it awaits presence or absence. The complexion gradually becomes moist, the bones and joints grow ever stronger. Dispel all yin demons, then establish the true yang and cultivate it without cease. May the *qi* of clouds and rain flow abundantly like spring’s gentle rain, the fluids flow like melting ice, descending from the head to the feet, then ascending again, circulating through the boundless cavern, suffusing the entire being. The returning is the verification of the Dao; weakness is the socket of virtue. Plow and sow the fields of former faults, cleanse the filth of the minute—once regulated, the turbid becomes the path to clarity, and long darkness turns to luminous brightness.\n\nThis chapter meticulously details the secret methods of entering the chamber to refine the Elixir. Once a student receives the oral instructions of a teacher, they must recite this chapter ten thousand times, savoring each sentence and pondering every word. Do not read it carelessly, for even a single character misplaced will prevent the Elixir’s formation. This chapter is the crucial point where the tally matches the contract, containing truths that cannot be divulged in words—what heaven treasures.\n\nMoreover, though human nature at birth is without ungoodness, as one grows older, few among those not endowed with sagely potential remain steadfast. Most are led astray by dissolute friends and external temptations, or bewildered by the allure of sensual pleasures and desires. At the gates of the six senses—sight, sound, and speech—every object of affection becomes a daily and nightly act of harm, each a most bitter poison. The ear, eye, and mouth...",

      "translated_text": "Hear with the ear, see with the eye, crave with the mouth—flavors. For this reason, fortune is ruined by form, harm arrives with sound, illness enters through the mouth, dreams arise, and drunkenness leads to death. Endlessly, how can one escape? Most scholars fail to attain the Dao because these three—ear, eye, and mouth—like neighboring friends, lure one another, drowning and losing their true nature. The immortal elders regard ear, eye, and mouth as the \"Three Treasures,\" revering them and never daring to indulge lightly. Thus, they seal them tightly, preventing their activation. Only when entering the chamber does their great function manifest; only when the six roots are profoundly settled can one gather and refine the true person—who is none other than the earth of *si* (巳).\n\nThose who plunge into the deep abyss use the earth of *si* to restrain water and seek the Elixir. Those who float and guard the compass’s center—this center is called the \"Cavern of Creation.\" When refining the Great Elixir, in the instant of this talisman, one must be most cautious and secretive. The floater remains ever still yet ever responsive, never straying from this function. The guardian works diligently, inwardly illuminating, for there is indeed something to await. These two lines again serve as the crucial point where the tally matches the contract, akin to wielding a great axe in labor. Thus, the true immortals and sagely masters utter mysterious words and dharma teachings that no one across ten thousand generations can fathom. Master Shangyang revealed them fully, wishing that all might understand and practice this Dao.\n\n\"Turning and curving to see and hear\" is not a dull, closed-off blockage. Inwardly, one must turn and curve, subtly and carefully, in seeing and hearing, so that the opening and closing of the earth of *wu* (戊) is neither excessive nor deceptive, harmonizing with the earth of *si* as if swallowing or guarding. The nature of *si* is reckless and wild; only the earth of *wu* can serve as its pivot and control. This is called \"the pivot and control of *si*.\" What is meant by \"inexhaustible in movement and stillness\"? The Dao of *si* is direct in movement and focused in stillness. If skillfully employed, it will not lead to exhaustion.\n\nWhen *li* (離) qi is inwardly nourished and defended, the eye’s light turns inward. For *kan* (坎), one does not rely on acute hearing but must listen inwardly. For *dui* (兌), one does not engage in idle talk but harmonizes the breath to follow the transformations of primordial chaos. Only when these three are skillfully managed at their crucial points can one relax the body in an empty chamber. \"Relaxing the body\" means to be at ease without strain; \"empty chamber\" means to be pure and undefiled. Entrusting one’s will to emptiness and non-being—for emptiness and non-being are the birthplace of the primordial unity of qi. This is called \"the primordial qi that comes from emptiness and non-being.\" To obtain this qi, one must bend and submit one’s thoughts to seek it.\n\n\"Non-thought\" is most useful. The true person plunges into the deep abyss, responding with non-thought. The floater guards the compass’s center, awaiting with non-thought. Breathing intermingles and nurtures, achieved through non-thought. The three natures unite, entering through non-thought. To respond, await, achieve, and enter—these functions rely on abundance, thus making it a constant practice.\n\nThe earth of *wu* is called the White Tiger, whose nature is changeable, restless, and difficult to stabilize. If restrained by the earth of *si*, one must never allow it to run rampant or shift carelessly. Should the mind lack focus, disasters may arise. Earlier, it was said \"non-thought\"; now, it is said \"the mind must be focused and not run rampant.\" Can one not ponder this deeply?\n\nIn sleep, spirit and qi embrace when the mind does not run rampant and thoughts do not shift. At this moment of sleep, spirit and qi naturally unite. Yet one must remain ever awake and ever aware, observing the presence or absence of this qi. Only at this stage of refining the Elixir does one begin to perceive its verification. In the past, when I received my master’s instructions, this segment seemed most difficult. Recently, while practicing this great work on the northern slope of Mount Daluo, I found it surprisingly easy.\n\nThe essential point is to cultivate without ceasing; only then can the full merit be accomplished. Thus, when the immortal elders clearly gather, refine, and burn, not the slightest error can be tolerated. From the subtle moistening of complexion downward, every sentence must be applied precisely, with none left idle. Only after obtaining the Elixir will its natural effects manifest in various signs. Those who practice this Dao in the filthy, corrupt world, cultivating the Dharma beyond the world, if they persevere without interruption, will surely succeed in their merit. Do not abandon the path midway due to minor demonic obstacles. This is called \"the path from turbidity to clarity; prolonged darkness will surely brighten.\" Attaining sagehood and immortality can be expected any day. The merit is most spiritually swift, hence it is named the \"Divine Elixir.\" Those who follow side paths gain no merit. **Chapter Twenty-Three: Side Paths Yield No Merit**\n\nPeople of the world favor petty arts, failing to discern the depth of the Dao. They abandon the correct path to follow deviant shortcuts, seeking quick results that lead to blockage. Like the blind without a staff or the deaf listening to music, they fish for pheasants and hares in water or search for fish and dragons on mountains. They plant wheat hoping for millet, or wield compasses to seek squares, exhausting their strength and spirit year after year without success. To know the method of \"subduing and ingesting,\" the matter is simple and not complex.\n\nPeople of the world favor petty arts, but petty arts are not the vessel of the Dao. Their scope is shallow and narrow, unfit to hear the great Dao. The Dao is vast, encompassing heaven and earth; it is deep and boundless as the sea. Yet people, by nature, cannot comprehend it. First poisoned by blind teachers, their initial words become dominant, and the true Dao has no chance to be heard. Those who prefer side paths, practicing \"dual cultivation\" or abandoning the correct path to follow deviant ones, ingest medicines seeking lightness and ascension. Their haste leads to blockage; their essence is exhausted, and their nature is not nurtured. Like the blind without a staff, borrowing the Dao to engage in debates, they are as deaf listening to music. Why not observe the tally and the five phases without inversion? Searching for fish and dragons on mountains, sitting in dry meditation to seek immortality, planting wheat hoping for millet—if one acts thus to attain the Dao, wielding compasses to seek squares, all such efforts exhaust strength and spirit. Without encountering a sagely master, one labors year after year without success. To know the method of \"subduing and ingesting,\" the ancient immortals’ words are not complex: \"Subdue qi without ingesting qi; ingest qi only after subduing qi. Ingesting qi does not lead to longevity; longevity comes from subduing qi.\" These words are the true and wondrous secret, guiding those of the highest rank.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four: Flowing Pearl and Golden Flower**\n\nThe flowing pearl of the Great Yang ever seeks to depart; when one suddenly obtains the Golden Flower, it turns and intermingles, transforming into a white liquid that congeals into hardness. The Golden Flower first sings, and in a moment, dissolves into water. The horse’s teeth are coral and carnelian; the Yang then proceeds to harmonize. Nature and emotions naturally press and urge. When Yin constrains and stores, it is the compassionate mother nurturing the filial son to repay kindness; the stern father issues commands to instruct descendants. The five phases intermingle, jade-like, relying on one another to generate fire. Fire’s nature melts metal; metal chops wood. The three, five, and one unite with heaven and earth. Their utmost essence can be transmitted orally but not written down.\n\nYou must turn right at *wu* and rotate east at *mao*. The boundary between *mao* and *you* separates host and guest. The dragon calls to the tiger; the tiger inhales the dragon’s essence. Both drink and consume, each coveting the other, then mutually swallowing and chewing, devouring one another. When Mars guards the west and Venus traverses the sky, the killing qi arrives—what cannot be overthrown? When the fox and dog guard the rat, and birds fear the goshawk, each fulfills its function—how dare they make a sound? Without grasping the principle, one should not speak recklessly.

      "translated_text": "This chapter clearly points to the *flowing pearl* and *golden flower* as the two entities of yin and yang, further revealing the secret precautions in the firing and refinement—so detailed and precise that it can only be transmitted orally, not committed to writing. Master Shangyang thus reaffirmed this principle in verse:\n\nThe *Great Yang*’s flowing pearl departs, bearing the sun’s crow;\nFrom the *Li* palace, the *naga*-maiden—neither form nor pearl.\nThe *Great Yang*’s radiance truly claims the title of *Dry Father*;\nWithin cinnabar lies mercury, and mercury is the ancestor of cinnabar.\n\nOrdinary people, led astray by the six thieves, forcefully carve and bore, causing the flowing pearl to either drip (like the dragon’s spittle) or escape. When gold resides in *Dui* and *Kan* generates the flower, the true water of *Kan* can then restrain the cinnabar of *Li*. Perpetually subdued by metal and water, it transforms into a white liquid. At the proper time, refining returns gold to its former state, and the flower first emits the *True Earth*. At *si-si*, the spirit must flourish; at *si-day*, the earth spirit surges. A jade vessel ascends to the high seat, exposing both feet. The golden flower transmutes into water, and in a brief moment, its color resembles horse-tooth stalactite, *gan-gan* jade, or dry yang as a guest seeking a companion. Yang’s nature and yin’s disposition delight in warmth, intertwining and entangling. Yin is pressed by yang; yin is urged by yang. They spur one another, restraining and constraining. Between the two kidneys lies the *Forbidden Gate*. One yin, one yang; one *Qian*, one *Kun*. The compassionate mother says: “Metal gives birth to *Kan* water, and water is the *Metal Duke*—water is called the filial son.” The stern father says: “Wood gives birth to cinnabar-mercury, and mercury begets the grandson.” If the grandson’s thoughts are not single-minded and strict, issuing commands, the five phases will err and invert, with mutual conquests and responses. Lead, mercury, cinnabar, and silver rely on earth. When fire flourishes, earth is born; earth is the mother of metal. When fire prevails, it melts metal; wood fears metal’s punishment. Metal is felled by fire, and wood thus flourishes. In the southeast, five woods and three fires; in the northwest, five waters and one metal; four in the center. *Wu-si* is called the number of the Three and Five, extending from one to ten thousand, through *jing* and *gai*, completing the tally to match heaven and earth. Mutual resonance stirs the utmost essence—this resonance and that union. The oral transmission must be clear: you should rotate right, then east. Whether halting or swift, yang metal is born at *zi-wu*, then revolves east; yin mercury is born at *wu*, enclosing and securing yang’s essence. At *mao* and *you*, host and guest—though gold’s origin lies between them, separated by ten thousand *li*—embrace benevolence and virtue. Gold delights in wood’s compliance. The dragon calls, the tiger inhales; gold cherishes wood’s benevolence. One host, one guest, drinking and consuming in kinship. One crow, one hare, both coveting; one man, one woman, then swallowing and chewing; one *kui*, one snake, devouring one another. The southern spirit, the Vermilion Bird, with Mars guarding and occupying the west, forges and refines metal’s virtue. The killing force of *Dui* demands utmost caution—lest the slightest error occur. Containing and storing the vital intent is called *Venus* traversing the ecliptic, faithfully returning to the *Dry Corpse*’s baleful *qi*. Once it arrives, life is extinguished and spread, like a cat seizing a rat or a bird fearing the goshawk—each fulfills its function. How dare they make a sound? Without the oral transmission, how can one guess or speak? To squander family wealth, pursuing heterodox paths, deviant tracks, *cai-zhan* misguidance, and delusion—such grave transgressions bring ruin upon others and oneself. From ancient times to now, countless have pursued this, yet few meet a true teacher. Rare are those who succeed. Without understanding yin and yang, how can one know their union? Seeking famous medicines far and wide only depletes true *qi*. Minerals, plants, and trees—devoid of *qi*—are distant from the Dao, separated by ten thousand *li*. The method’s outline is expounded here to clarify the profound canon for later learners, enabling them to become immortals.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: If Truly Encountered**\n\nIf truly encountered and the thread is glimpsed, use *qi* to compare and measure things from beginning to end. The five phases mutually conquer, alternating as father and mother. The mother contains nourishing fluids; the father governs bestowal and congealing essence, shaping form. Like metal and stone, it does not decay. If one examines and focuses without leakage, one can achieve the Dao—like raising a hundred-foot pole to see its shadow, or calling into a thousand-peak valley to hear its echo. How can it not be efficacious? The supreme image of heaven and earth is such that if one swallows a mere inch of *yege* or a *ba-dou* seed, one will collapse, unable to bend or straighten. At such a time, even if King Wen cast yarrow stalks, Confucius interpreted omens, Bian Que wielded needles, or Wu Xian beat drums, none could revive or rouse the fallen.\n\nThis chapter means: if one meets a teacher, one must first carefully observe and discern the thread—whether it is orthodox or heterodox. Compare it with the *Cantong Qi*; if it is a true teacher, nothing will be unknown, and no question will remain unanswered. If it is a blind teacher, nine out of ten things will be misunderstood, fabricating strange tales to lure people into the weeds. Some claim silence is the Dao; others insist only sitting in meditation and contemplating emptiness. Ask them about cinnabar, mercury, tiger, dragon, metal, wood, the separation of *mao* and *you*, the *Zhen* trigram’s three-day image, or the reverse use of the primordial—yet they cannot answer, left mute by the alchemical classics. Foolish worldly people, hearing that so-and-so has sat in meditation for years or entered the marketplace a few times, immediately declare them enlightened. How would they know Master Ma’s rebuke of Nanyue for grinding bricks? How would they understand the principle of yin and yang swallowing and restraining, the dynamics of generation and destruction?\n\nThere are also vulgar sorts who parrot others’ dregs, speaking only of Chan’s sharp debate, calling it the *Nature School* and claiming it as the Dao to deceive the world—how lamentable! What do they know of Chan and nature?\n\nWhat is *nature*? It is *Qian*’s function, the Nine in use—its movement is direct. If one can comprehend this, it is the *True Dharma Eye Treasury*.\n\nWhat is *Chan*? It is *Kun*’s function, the Six in use—its movement is expansive. If one knows this, it is the *Nirvana Wondrous Mind*.\n\nChan and nature unite through earth restraining lead; metal and wood merge through lead subduing mercury. Benevolence and righteousness are applied to nurture *qi* directly. Thus, one yin and one yang are the Dao of the *Yi*. Cultivating concentration in the *Li* palace is the root of Chan; seeking the mysterious in the water palace is the abode of the elixir. Though the names divide into three teachings, they are ultimately one. Observing the threads of the three teachings’ cultivation, all require the union of *qi* to succeed—this is what is meant by “using *qi* to compare.”\n\nWhat is “measuring things from beginning to end”? It means assessing the generation of humans and things, the yin and yang of their beginnings and ends, the causes of their waxing and waning. Thus, the five phases mutually generate and conquer, alternating between prosperity and decline, cycle after cycle, becoming father and mother. The Dao practiced by the supreme sages and perfected ones is the *si* of yin and yang—its essence contains and stores nourishing *qi*, as *Kun* and *Dui* alternate to become the *Holy Mother*. Its wonder governs bestowal and generation, as *Qian* and *Zhen* alternate to become the *Numinous Father*. *Qi* and fluids congeal essence, flowing to form shape, coalescing into the elixir—firm as metal and stone, imperishable. If one examines and focuses without leakage, one can achieve the Dao—like raising a pole to see its shadow, or calling into a valley to hear its echo. The natural resonance of yin and yang is most efficacious, harmonizing with the supreme image of heaven and earth’s creation.",

      "translated_text": "The heartless plants and trees—wild aconite and croton—can still kill a man. How much more so the *qi* of true yin and true yang, both sentient beings, when matched in harmony? How could they fail to congeal the numinous elixir?\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Maiden of the Yellow Sprout**\nThe Maiden of the River is numinous and most wondrous. When she meets fire, she takes flight, vanishing like dust and ash. The hidden dragon conceals itself, its whereabouts unknown. To restrain her, the Yellow Sprout serves as the root. All things possess yin and yang; to defy heaven and turn one’s back on the primordial is like a hen hatching her own chicks—imperfect. Why? Because the union is not yet complete, the Three and Five unjoined, hardness and softness sundered. The essence of transformation—heaven and earth’s natural fire rises upward, water flows downward—requires no master to guide it so. The origin is governed by rectitude; once set, it cannot be altered.\n\nObserve the moment when male and female unite: hardness and softness bind inseparably, attaining their proper rhythm without need for craft or control. The male is born prone, the female curled—this is the way of the womb, the reception of *qi* at life’s inception. It is not merely seen at birth but mirrored in death, for no parent teaches this; it is fixed at the moment of union, predetermined from the start.\n\nThe River Lord’s love is a metaphor for the sea of desire. The Maiden is none other than the essence of one’s own yin mercury. Why is she called numinous and most wondrous? Because she can give life, take life, or merge into the elixir. When still and unmoving, the solitary spirit is inwardly nurtured. Yet the instant it stirs and connects, it rushes forth like a divine realm in motion. Passion arises, fortune follows form, and intent falters. The moment a thought arises, mercury flees with the fire, scattering like dust and ash, irretrievable. The dragon of essence hides its form; clouds disperse, the sky empties—emptiness is itself form. This aligns with the twenty-fourth chapter’s *Taiyang* flowing pearl, ever desiring to depart. People heedlessly watch it pass, so it returns here, drawn out and extended. The sage’s merit surpasses later generations—so it is.\n\nTo restrain her, the Yellow Sprout serves as the root, just as the sudden attainment of golden blossoms turns and interrelates, sharing the same principle. For the Maiden, compliance leads to easy loss; without the Yellow Sprout’s solitary yang, she cannot be subdued. The Yellow Sprout is the *qi* of the primordial, called the True One’s lead. When this lead *qi* is refined as the foundation, mercury will not flee. Why? Because yin and yang are paired to make it so.\n\nAll things devoid of yin and yang defy the creative power of heaven and turn their backs on the origin of life. Those who refine the elixir do not depart from yin and yang to establish their foundation. Yet once the True One’s *qi* returns and the elixir ripens, one leaps beyond yin and yang. Foolish worldly people, unversed in the elixir scriptures, claim that cultivators must dwell in deep mountains, live in solitude, abandon wives and children, practice fasting, embrace non-action, and sit in meditation—taking these as the Dao. How deluded!\n\nIf one does not employ yin and yang, does not investigate the Five Phases, cannot distinguish metal and wood, does not recognize dragon and tiger, does not understand lead and mercury, and remains ignorant of *Kan* and *Li*—how can one achieve the Dao through mere silence? Thus, this book vigorously corrects such errors, repeatedly stating that only the union of yin and yang constitutes the Dao. Just as a hen without a rooster hatches chicks that do not survive—pure yin without yang—if one wishes to raise chicks, one must fill a vessel with water at noon and warm it in the sun, borrowing yang *qi* to complete them. Without warmth, they will not hatch.\n\nWhy? Because, like creation itself, the union is incomplete, the Three and Five unjoined, hardness and softness sundered. How can the way of ceaseless generation arise? Thus, in the Land of Women, where no men exist, if they wish to conceive, they must choose a day and, at three times daily, gaze into the well, borrowing the *qi* of true water. Observing the reflection in the well as a means of union, they may become pregnant. This is the essence of yin and yang’s transformative power—the natural resonance of heaven and earth. Fire rises, water descends; no master guides them so. The origin is governed by rectitude; once the *qi* is set, the *Yi* says: *\"Great indeed is Qian’s primal power! All things receive their beginning from it; it governs heaven.\"* The Dao of Qian transforms and rectifies each being’s nature and destiny. Once nature and destiny are rectified, how can they be altered? Thus, observe the moment when male and female unite: hardness and softness bind inseparably, attaining their proper rhythm without craft or control. The male is born prone, the female curled—these are the utmost principles, unalterable by creation itself. Not only in life, but even in drowning, the male lies prone, the female curled. No parent teaches this; it is fixed at the moment of union, predetermined from the start. To the vulgar eye, such words may seem trivial, but the author’s intent is to illuminate the principles of yin and yang, repeating them often without tedium.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: Mutual Need of Male and Female**\n*Kan* male is the moon; *Li* female is the sun. The sun bestows virtue; the moon unfurls its light. The moon receives the sun’s transformation, its body unharmed. If yang loses its bond, yin encroaches upon its brightness. At the new moon, they draw near, eclipsing and obscuring one another, vying for dominance. Yang’s form diminishes; yin’s encroachment brings calamity. Male and female depend on one another, earth nourishing them. Yin and yang intermingle, seeking one another. Metal transforms into water, water’s nature circulating freely. Fire transforms into earth; without earth, water cannot flow. The male moves outward; the female remains inwardly still. If yang overflows beyond measure, it is constrained by yin, the po restraining the hun. Without excess or deficiency, neither cold nor heat, advancing and retreating in harmony, each attains equilibrium, both emitting confirming signs.\n\n*Kan* is water, the moon, the middle son—externally yin, internally yang, containing *wu* earth to store metal and water, nurturing its yin po. It is the gate of the middle essence, the doorway of Dao and righteousness—the white within black.\n\n*Li* is fire, the sun, the middle daughter—internally yin, externally yang, containing *si* earth to house cinnabar mercury, governing its yang hun. It is the embodiment of nature, the vessel of benevolence and virtue—the black within white.\n\nThe moon’s body is inherently dark; receiving the sun’s transformation, its light and luster return, its body unharmed. If yang loses its bond—its union—yin encroaches upon its brightness. At the new moon, when the moon obscures the sun’s light, the sun’s body is above, the moon below, temporarily blocking the sun’s radiance. This is called yang’s form diminishing, yin’s encroachment bringing calamity. Thus, people cannot preserve true yang, repeatedly scorched by yin’s encroachment.\n\nWhen yin and yang are inverted and mutually stimulated, male and female depend on one another, seeking the mechanism of transformation. Then *Dui* metal generates *Kan* water. Without true earth, *Kan* water overflows. *Li* contains fire, which generates *si* earth to restrain *Kan* water, preventing its overflow.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the Dao of man is the *qian* trigram—firm and outwardly active; the virtue of woman is the *kun* trigram—quiescent and inwardly stored. If *qian*’s outward activity exceeds its measure and transgresses its bounds, it is constrained by the *kun* woman’s power, the *po* restraining the *hun*. The *po* pertains to *Dui*, the *hun* to *Zhen*. *Zhen* is male, *Dui* is female. When yin and yang unite, they must not indulge in excess or luxury; rather, let there be a cycle of cold and heat, each advancing and retreating in harmony, timely and unerring. Only then will male and female each emit their signs of verification, and their efficacy be made manifest.\n\nThe gist of this chapter lies in this: when one exceeds bounds, indulges in excess, or transgresses measure, yin encroaches and calamity arises. Thus, in midwinter, summer’s commands bring scorching heat; in midsummer, winter’s commands return bitter cold. This is when the male acts but the female does not follow, yang sings but yin does not harmonize—yin and yang fall into discord, all due to exceeding bounds and indulging in excess.\n\nThe elixir is not easily refined; take heed not to treat it lightly. The Venerable Pure Yang, having received the transmission from the Immortal Elder Zhongli, entered seclusion and repeatedly labored, yet found his work not yet perfected and the elixir not yet formed. Later, he was granted the *Mirror of Ingredients* by the Perfected Master Cui of Mysterious Origin, through which he gained thorough understanding. He then composed a poem:\n\n*Beholding Master Cui’s Mirror of Ingredients,*\n*The mind’s terrain grows ever clearer.*\nThereafter, his practice swiftly bore fruit.\n\nFoolish men of later times, relying solely on “non-action” and emptiness as the Dao, drift through days in vague uncertainty, letting life and death take their course—these are the great sinners of the teaching. How dare they speak of cultivation?\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight: The Four in Chaos**\n\nWhen cinnabar and wood-essence obtain metal, they unite; where metal and water meet, wood and fire become companions. The four in chaos are arrayed as dragon and tiger: the dragon is yang, its number odd; the tiger is yin, its number even. The liver, green, is the father of fire; the lungs, white, are the mother of water; the kidneys, black, are the child of metal; *Li*, red, is the daughter of wood; the spleen, yellow, is the ancestor of the four. *Zi* and *Wu* mark the beginning. These three things form one family, all returning to *Wu* and *Si*.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: The most numinous and precious in the human body are essence and *qi*. The *Heart Seal Scripture* regards them as the supreme medicine; Zhang Ziyang calls them the treasure of life. The books composed by immortals share common ground yet differ. What is common? When metal returns to water, it is first called the Reverted Elixir—this is the simplest and most universal. What differs? *Qian* and *Kun*, *Kan* and *Li*; the female and male, the bellows and key; opening and closing; non-being and being; yin and yang; sun and moon; the Mysterious Female; *Wu* and *Si*; hardness and softness; male and female; the Dipper’s pivot and the Northern Asterism; the Raven and Hare; *hun* and *po*; metal and *qi*; spirit and brightness; the Yellow Sprout; the River Chariot; lead and silver; cinnabar and mercury; floating and sinking; black and white; the Primordial Chaos; the indistinct and vague; the compass’s center; the pivot’s pin; emptiness and nothingness; the dim and distant; the Perfected Man; the Great Abyss; the walls and gates; Penglai; the Vermilion Bird; the Dark Warrior; the White Tiger; the Azure Dragon; the pivot’s burning; the flowing pearl; golden cinnabar; liquid silver; the Eight White Stones; yellow earth; the two apertures; the abode of numinous virtue; the recumbent moon furnace; the suspended embryo tripod; the red-colored gate; the bright window’s dust; the upper and lower *kun*; civil and martial fire; cinnabar and wood-essence; the maiden of the River’s shore; the city walls of Yin and E; horse-teeth coral; the forbidden gate; the knife’s tip; golden radiance; autumn stone; emotion and nature; host and guest; white snow; the yellow chariot; the Mysterious Ditch; the River Drum; Mount Zeng; the gnomon’s shadow; stalactite; the verdant fluid; the Three and Five; the Two and Seven; grains and ounces; hexagrams and tally-signs—such names and forms are all treasures within the body. Some are metaphors for gates and doors, some for the chamber of spirit, some for the tripod and vessel, some for function and form, some for shapes and images, some for advance and retreat. Thus, the *Yijing* takes *qian*’s straightness and *kun*’s opening as the gate of life and death; the elixir method takes the Magpie Bridge and the Yellow Path as the road of coming and going—yet all do not depart from the body’s essence and *qi*.\n\nThese are provisional names with differing terms. Thus, this chapter speaks of cinnabar and wood-essence obtaining metal and uniting, echoing the earlier meaning of the sun’s flowing pearl ever desiring to leave man, only to be turned and bound by golden radiance—this is the same principle.\n\nThe flowing pearl, the maiden, and cinnabar are all inherently yin, lacking yang, belonging to the posterior heaven, and thus unable to form the elixir. Metal, the Yellow Sprout, and golden radiance are the prior-heaven lead that can refine the Reverted Elixir. Thus, cinnabar and wood-essence are the mercury within *Li*, the father of fire, the wood of *jia* and *yi* in the east that generates true essence—this is called the central daughter. Therefore, the wood of *jia* and *yi* in the east and the fire of *bing* and *ding* in the south are one father and one daughter. The father and his daughter are yang within yin, so *Zhen* wood and *Li* fire become companions. The Yellow Sprout and golden fluid are the lead within *Kan*, the mother of water, the metal of *geng* and *xin* in the west that nurtures its fluid to become the central son. Thus, the metal of *geng* and *xin* in the west and the water of *ren* and *gui* in the north are one mother and one child. The mother and her child are yin within yang, so *Dui* metal and *Kan* water unite. Wood, fire, metal, and water—these four in chaos are arrayed as dragon and tiger, one in the east and one in the west. The dragon dwells in the east, its number three, thus the dragon is yang, its number odd; the tiger belongs to the west, its number four, thus the tiger is yin, its number even. Wood and fire are companions, for the dragon emerges from fire; metal and water unite, for the tiger is born from water. The liver, green, pertains to wood and is the father of fire; the lungs, white, pertain to metal and are the mother of water; the kidneys, black, pertain to water and are the child of metal; *Li*, red, pertains to fire and is the daughter of wood; the spleen, yellow, pertains to earth and is the ancestor of the four. The child begins the five phases, thus is the first of the one yang. Metal and water, wood and fire, dragon and tiger—these are the three things. If these three things interact and form one family, they must rely on the power of *Wu* and *Si* earth to accomplish their function.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: The Punishment and Virtue of Mao and You**\n\nHardness and softness alternate, traversing and distributing. The dragon is west, the tiger east; *Mao* and *You* establish the warp, punishment and virtue guard and assist, meeting in joy. Punishment governs subjugation and killing; virtue governs generation and arising. In the second month, the elm scatters, the *Kui* star descends upon *Mao*; in the eighth month, wheat sprouts, the *Tian Gang* star occupies *You*. *Zi* is south, *Wu* is north, mutually serving as the warp and weft. The number one and nine end and begin again, containing the primordial, the Void and Danger spreading essence to *Zi*.\n\nThe Azure Dragon belongs to the east, the White Tiger to the west—this is their proper place. “Traversing and distributing” means the Azure Dragon establishes the warp in *You*, the White Tiger establishes the warp in *Mao*—punishment and virtue guard and assist, dragon and tiger meet in joy, overturned and intermingled. Thus, when dragon and tiger meet and guard, uniting in one place, the two things rejoice, governing generation as virtue. If the dragon is in the east and the tiger in the west, each fixed in its position, self-generating and self-flourishing, the two things contend and disturb, governing killing as punishment. Punishment is the meaning of yin and yang in discord, the metaphor of male and female meeting. Punishment is the five phases proceeding in order; virtue is the five phases overturned. Punishment is yin diminishing its yang; virtue is yang uniting with...",

Thus, people cannot preserve true yang, repeatedly scorched by yin’s encroachment.\n\nWhen yin and yang are inverted and mutually stimulated, male and female depend on one another, seeking the mechanism of transformation. Then *Dui* metal generates *Kan* water. Without true earth, *Kan* water overflows. *Li* contains fire, which generates *si* earth to restrain *Kan* water, preventing its overflow.",

      "translated_text": "When yin governs punishment, yin is abundant and yang scarce; when yang governs virtue, yin is scarce and yang abundant. Take, for instance, the hexagram of the second month, with four yang and two yin lines: as yang grows and yin recedes, though yang is abundant, it remains in surplus. When yang is in surplus, it governs virtue; when yin is in surplus, it governs killing. Thus, in the three spring months, the myriad things flourish together, yet the elm’s pods fall—just as with humans. In the prime of youth, when yang is abundant and yin scarce in the body, one grows stronger day by day. Yet at this time, the fire of desire blazes fiercely; though yang is abundant, it is consumed by yin. Even if some yang remains, it cannot govern, and the hundred diseases invade. As yang nears depletion, one still clings to the realm of desire, exhausting all effort to seek yin. The remaining yang encounters yin and is entirely consumed, leading to sudden death—this is what it means for virtue to revert to punishment.\n\nIf one of superior wisdom seizes the remaining yang as a stepping-stone and swiftly practices the Way of Returning the Elixir, one may regain long life—this is what it means for punishment and virtue to guard and assist each other, for mutual encounter to bring joy.\n\nTake, for another instance, the hexagram of the eighth month, with four yin and two yang lines: yang is consumed by yin, and though yin is abundant, some surplus yang remains. When yin is in surplus, it governs punishment; when yang is in surplus, it governs generation. Thus, in the three autumn months, the myriad things wither, yet the shepherd’s purse and wheat begin to sprout—just as with humans. When one nears sixty-one, yin is abundant and yang scarce in the body, and one grows weaker day by day. Yet if at this time one is fortunate to retain some surplus yang and practices the Way of the Golden Elixir, one may restore yang—this is what it means to return to youth and regain one’s vitality.

      "translated_text": "At the midnight hour of the second month, the Dipper’s *kui* star aligns with the *mao* position, while the *gang* star rests above *si*; this upper position belongs to the south, governing generation as virtue. In the eighth month at the *xu* hour, the Dipper’s *gang* star occupies the *you* earth, and the *kui* star aligns with *hai*; this upper position lies in the northwest, governing destruction as punishment. The classic states: when the *gang* star points to *chou*, its body resides in *wei*—what it points to is auspicious, where it resides is inauspicious. The same applies to all other positions. This illustrates the function of refining the Golden Elixir.\n\n*Zi* (north) inverted becomes south, *wu* (south) inverted becomes north—this is the reversal of the Five Phases. The immortals and sages say: when the Five Phases proceed in sequence, they become the fiery pit of the *dharmadhātu*; when the Five Phases are inverted, they become the Seven Treasures of the great earth. Thus, only when water and fire serve as mutual guiding principles can the *Completion* be achieved.\n\nYang arises at one and culminates at nine; when yang’s number reaches nine, it reaches its limit, and at its limit, it returns to one. This is called the cycle of one and nine, ending and beginning anew. The *Xu* and *Wei* lodges sow essence at *zi*—the success of the Elixir lies in these two lines. For *Xu* and *Wei* are the *kan* of the union of sun and moon, the place where the first yang arises, the coiled lair of the serpent. Thus, the Great One contains the primordial *qi* of the precelestial, and its true essence is sown at *zi*. This again corresponds to the principle of *zi* and *wu* as the beginning of the cycle, as discussed in the previous chapter.\n\nOrdinary people merely hear that *mao* and *you* are for bathing, yet how can they understand the metaphor of punishment and virtue? Virtue and generation are like obtaining the medicine in half an hour, while punishment and destruction are like losing it in an instant. Therefore, when entering the chamber, one must guard against danger and contemplate peril to refine the Elixir. The immortal elder compares this to the flourishing of spring, when all things grow—yet even the elm’s pods wither. Here, virtue guards against punishment, and generation guards against destruction. In the solemnity of autumn, when all things wither, shepherd’s purse and wheat still sprout. Here, punishment contains virtue, and destruction contains generation.\n\nThis book discusses these matters with utmost clarity, illuminating them in every way.

      "translated_text": "The ancient sages and worthies, embracing the Mysterious and holding fast to the True, secluded themselves to refine the Nine Cauldrons, transforming their traces and concealing their luminosity. They nurtured essence, cultivated spirit, and penetrated the virtue of the Three Luminaries. Their fluids and pores, sinews and bones, became firm; all perverse influences were dispelled, and the upright qi abided long. Through long accumulation, they transformed their forms and became immortals.\n\nMoved by compassion for later generations who cherished the Dao, they followed the winds of inspiration, tracing ancient texts and composing diagrams and scriptures to enlighten posterity. Yet they revealed only branches and leaves, concealing the root, or adopted various names to obscure the truth. Many literati, obtaining these works, treasured them in caskets, passing them down as a family legacy from father to son and grandson to grandson. Yet through the ages, delusion prevailed, and none perceived their meaning. Thus, officials abandoned their posts, farmers neglected their plowing, merchants forsook their goods, and scholars, though aspiring, remained impoverished. I grieve deeply for them.\n\nHerein, I record these words, concise in form yet profound in meaning, sparing in detail yet rich in substance. I set forth their principles clearly, with measured steps and numbered divisions, that they may be observed and followed. Yet because the sequence has been disrupted and the language disordered, the gates and apertures remain obscure. Let the wise ponder carefully and guard their intentions.\n\nThe great sages of antiquity necessarily comprehended the supreme Dao. Thus, the writings of Fuxi, Shennong, and the Yellow Emperor all expound the Great Dao, and the *Yin Fu Jing* abides eternally in its three hundred and fifteen characters. Later generations, failing to grasp the Dao, wildly conjectured about the text, claiming that a hundred words expound the Dao, another hundred the method, and yet another hundred the technique. Such men are deaf and blind to the world—how could they fathom the Dao of the sages?\n\nThe *Yin Fu Jing* begins with \"Observing the Dao of Heaven\" in one hundred and twenty characters, which sets forth the guiding principles of the Dao. The next ninety-one characters, \"The Dao of Heaven and Earth and the Myriad Things,\" describe its practical application. The final one hundred and four characters, \"Though Blind, They Hear Well,\" reveal the essentials of success. Thus, the Yellow Emperor refined the Nine Cauldrons at Mount Dinghu, achieving the Great Elixir and ascending on a dragon. This was not the alchemy of refining metals, minerals, herbs, or plants, but the subjugation of primordial qi to form the Elixir. Thus, it is called \"subduing and refining,\" not \"ingesting and refining.\"\n\nThe term \"subduing and refining\" encompasses specific practices. Embracing the Mysterious and holding fast to the True, transforming one’s traces and concealing one’s luminosity, nurturing essence and cultivating spirit, and penetrating the virtue of the Three Luminaries—these seven are the primary undertakings, called the \"furnace and fire,\" which is what is meant by \"refining the self.\" If one can refine the self, the true qi will suffuse the entire body, warming it like fire in a furnace—hence the terms \"furnace and fire\" and \"refining the self.\"\n\nThe firming of fluids and pores, sinews and bones, the dispelling of perverse influences, and the enduring presence of upright qi—these four are called \"subduing the qi,\" which is what is meant by \"refining the Elixir.\" Embracing the Mysterious means inwardly harboring the singular qi of the Mysterious; holding fast to the True means embracing the authentic truth of the Great One. Transforming one’s traces means concealing one’s light and hiding one’s tracks, so that few know me, and those who recognize me are rare. Concealing one’s luminosity means sinking into obscurity, making oneself unrecognizable. Thus, the ancients who excelled as scholars were subtle, mysterious, and profoundly unknowable. Nurturing essence means saturating oneself with the eternal essence of the True to refine the self. Cultivating spirit means outwardly nourishing the spirit of the entire body to harmonize with the qi. Accumulating merit to this point is the great essential of penetrating the virtue of the Three Luminaries.\n\nVirtue is the highest endeavor in the practice of the Dao. To cultivate the Dao without cultivating virtue is to possess yin but lack yang; only when virtue and Dao are both cultivated do yin and yang naturally unite. Those who cultivate virtue may claim to possess it, yet in truth, they do not, for their virtue is tainted by deluded thoughts and fails to resonate. The deeper and more sincere one’s virtue, the less one thinks of it. Heaven and Earth, the gods and spirits, the sun, moon, and stars—all respond to virtue. Zhang, Ge, and Xu accumulated and cultivated virtue with a sincere heart, aspiring to this resonance—this is what is meant by \"penetrating the virtue of the Three Luminaries.\"\n\nOnly after diligently refining the self and accumulating virtue to the point of resonance can one subdue and refine the Great Elixir. The fluids and pores refer to the Jade Fluid—White Snow—and the Golden Liquid—Yellow Sprout. When Jade Fluid and Golden Liquid permeate the Chamber of Spirit, the sinews and bones of the entire body become firm. All perverse influences within the hundred bones are dispelled, and the primordial yang of upright qi abides long. Through long accumulation, one transforms form and becomes an immortal. This is what the Yellow Emperor’s refinement of the Nine Cauldrons and the Great Elixir signifies.\n\nThe *Qingfu Lu* states: In his first life, the Xuanyuan clan served as commoners; in his second, as ministers; and in his third, as sovereigns. After accumulating merit to its fullness, they ascended to Heaven. Following the *Yin Fu Jing*, the sagely succession is recorded in the classics: King Wen’s *Zhouyi* clarifies the gates of Qian and Kun; the *Xici* of Confucius elucidates the meaning of Qian’s activity and Kun’s receptivity; the *Daodejing* of five thousand characters reveals the gates of being and non-being, mystery and the female; Zisi’s *Zhongyong* defines destiny as nature and following nature as the Dao; Mencius’s *Yang Hao* expounds the utmost greatness and firmness, nurturing uprightness without harm. The teachings of Lao Peng and the metaphors of Zhuang Peng—all trace the path from sage to immortal.\n\nMoved by compassion for later scholars who cherish the Dao, the ancients followed their inspiration, tracing texts and composing diagrams and scriptures to enlighten posterity. Sometimes they revealed branches and leaves while concealing the root, or adopted various names to obscure the truth. The \"revealed branches\" refer to partial disclosures, such as \"Qian and Kun are the gates of the Changes.\" The root, however, must be transmitted orally—hence its concealment.\n\nThe \"adopted names to obscure the truth\" means that the teachings could not be stated openly; instead, metaphors and analogies were scattered throughout the texts. Later, those with discerning eyes who obtained these writings but did not encounter a teacher treasured them in secret for life. Only those of true capacity, like the descendants of a noble lineage, could carry on the tradition. Yet many students, though they possessed these texts, lacked a teacher’s guidance and fell into delusion, leading others astray onto crooked paths. They knew nothing of yin and yang, confused the Five Phases, and drowned in chaos.\n\nLater practitioners of the Dao, relying solely on these texts without oral transmission, are like scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants who have lost their livelihoods: officials seek office but find no path to the register; farmers desire to till but have no land to plow; artisans hold their skills but cannot apply them; merchants calculate profits but lose their capital. Likewise, though students possess the texts, without a teacher’s instruction, they have no starting point, and their wild conjectures and reckless actions cannot lead to the Dao. The immortal sages, moved by compassion, opened the refining furnace and recorded these words as a memento for the world. The language is concise, the meaning easy to ponder—like the line \"The true man hides in the deep abyss,\" where the matter is simple yet the principle unfolds. Or \"When gold comes, the nature returns to its origin,\" where the principles are set forth clearly.\n\nThe preceding section is divided into fifteen chapters, revealing the workings of yin and yang and the creation of the Elixir from beginning to end. The middle section is divided into fifteen chapters, detailing the measured steps and signs. The final section comprises five chapters on the symbolic forms and completion. Later readers, observing these divisions and verifying their substance, will find them easy to peruse. The numbers and measurements within all follow proper methods. With a teacher’s guidance and adherence to this sequence, one can achieve the Elixir.\n\nThe \"disordered language\" refers to the use of adopted names to obscure the truth. The \"gates and apertures\" encompass the profound mysteries of the Mysterious, serving as the ladder through the great kalpa and the torch illuminating the path for those lost in darkness. Let later sages and near-sages ponder carefully and employ them with care.\n\nThe Great Dao is not comprehended by those who are not sages, nor spoken of by those who are not worthies. Thus, fathers do not transmit it to their sons, nor ministers present it to their rulers. The Dao of the sages—how could it be transmitted lightly? They feared that without virtue, it would be difficult to bear, and that careless words might lead to downfall. Hence, the admonition: let the wise ponder carefully and guard their intentions.",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Thirty-Two: The Completion of Symbolic Forms**\n\nNo symbolic form is greater than Heaven and Earth. The Mysterious Trench spans ten thousand *li*; the River Drum faces the Star Marker—all people are struck with terror. The sundial’s shadow advances and retreats errantly; for nine years, calamity befalls. The August Emperor gazes upon it, and the king retreats to reform himself. The pivot’s rise and fall bring harm and ruin, causing the Yangzi and Huai to run dry, their waters flowing into the sea.\n\nHeaven and Earth’s feminine and masculine forces waver between *zi* and *wu*, *yin* and *shen*—yin and yang’s ancestors, emerging and entering, ever returning to their beginning. Following the Dipper’s handle, grasping the balance to fix the primal order, one ascends to the Steamer Mountain, where flames blaze and the White Tiger’s path chants ahead, while the Azure Essence harmonizes behind. The Vermilion Bird soars and plays, its feathers shimmering with five hues. Nets are cast, pressing down so it cannot rise—its wails are mournful, like an infant longing for its mother. Overturned into the boiling cauldron, its feathers and fur are crushed and broken. Before half a *ke* has passed, fish scales bristle, their fins stirring. The five colors gleam and dazzle, transforming without constancy. The cauldron seethes and surges, boiling violently without cease. Layer upon layer piles up, jagged as interlocking dog’s teeth, resembling midwinter ice. Jade-like stalactites and stalagmites mingle in towering confusion, propping one another up. Yin and yang find their match, dwelling together in tranquil harmony.\n\nThe Green Dragon resides in Chamber Six, spring’s blossoms trembling in the east at *mao*. The White Tiger dwells in Pleiades Seven, autumn’s awns withering in the west at *you*. The Vermilion Bird abides in Spread Two, the true yang mingling in the south at *wu*. When these three come to court together, their kin become companions. Originally but two things, in the end they become three. Three and five join with one, all gathering to return to two. The method of governance follows the above model; the days’ count takes the first as white, then yellow, red, and black, penetrating both inner and outer. This is called the First Cauldron, its sustenance like a grain of millet. It arises from nature’s workings, free of deceit or falsehood.\n\nThe mountains and marshes steam together, giving rise to clouds and rain. Mud dries to become dust; fire extinguishes to turn to earth. As the *huangbo* dyes yellow, the indigo becomes green. Boiling hides and skins makes glue; fermenting yeast transforms into wine. Though the workings are easily applied, without the seed, skill is in vain. Only this wondrous art is precise and truthful, its words transmitted to a hundred million generations, luminous and verifiable, shining like the Milky Way, radiant as the sea’s source.\n\nPonder deeply to ensure mastery, reviewing again and again—up and down a thousand cycles, ten thousand times—until the divine light may be glimpsed. The spirit may reveal it to others, or the heart may suddenly awaken. Seek the thread’s end, grasp its beginning, and you will find the gate and door. Entering the Dao, there is no path that does not return to the worthy.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: The sages’ Dao encompasses Heaven and Earth, yet enters the tiniest speck of dust. It is spoken of as vast yet utterly refined, lofty and luminous, the mean within the Dao. The Dao is Heaven’s secret, not displayed on bamboo or silk, passed only from mouth to mouth. The sages had no choice but to employ every metaphor to guide posterity.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor’s questions to Qi Bo began: \"When essence is insufficient, replenish it with flavor; when form is insufficient, replenish it with *qi*.\" These words alone reveal the Golden Elixir. King Wen’s *Yi* deepened Fu Xi’s: \"In the southwest, one gains a friend\"—this, too, discloses the method of replenishing *qi*. Confucius said: \"Like sounds resonate; like *qi* seeks its kind\"—this points to the art of replenishing *qi*. Laozi declared: \"The gate of the Mysterious Female is the root of Heaven and Earth\"—this clarifies the gate of replenishing *qi*. The *Cantong Qi* explicitly instructs on medicines, cauldrons, weights, fire phases, and the mutual dependence of metal and *qi*. The Perfected One’s teachings in the *Deep Abyss* are the clearest and most incisive. In the later chapters, symbolic analogies are used—sage after sage transmits it, yet the principle remains one.\n\nThus, the Ninefold Return of Golden Liquor and the Great Elixir serve but to replenish that single *qi*. Yet to replenish yin, one must use yang; to replenish yang, one must use yin—this is the *qi* of the Supreme Ultimate.\n\nWhat is meant by \"gold\"? What by \"elixir\"? The *qian*-beginning is gold; the *kun*-beginning is elixir. At *qian*’s inception, the Supreme Ultimate’s gold adheres to *kun*; at *kun*’s inception, the Supreme Ultimate’s *qi* transforms into elixir. *Qian*’s gold spreads through *kun*’s meridians, then flows and turns. The Metal Dragon resides in *dui*; *dui*’s metal generates water, and water’s inception gives birth to elixir. The elixir lies in the Tiger’s pen, for the tiger is born in water, dwelling in the west. To conjoin the elixir, first subdue the dragon. The dragon’s home is wood, manifesting in *li*; *li* holds yin fire, so the dragon emerges from within fire.\n\nThe dragon dwells in the east, the nine *qi* of the Azure Heaven, where the Green Emperor’s key governs as the true master, giving life to the myriad things. The tiger dwells in the west, the seven *qi* of the White Heaven, where the White Emperor’s bellows forge transformations, producing the myriad things. From west to east spans tens of thousands of *li*—yet the immortals use Heaven and Earth to illustrate *li* and *kan*, gold and water to compare the Mysterious Trench and River Drum, the Star Marker to liken the union’s defense. The sundial’s advance and retreat mirror the dragon’s ascent; the August Emperor’s gaze symbolizes sudden enlightenment. The pivot’s harm and ruin represent gathering and sealing. The feminine and masculine signify *zi* and *wu*; emergence and entry signify *yin* and *shen*. The Steamer Mountain is the gate of the distant and profound; the *Zhaoyao* is the portal of the indistinct and vague. The White Tiger is metal’s essence; the Vermilion Bird is fire’s spirit. The net’s casting signifies the initial step; the boiling cauldron represents refinement. The cauldron’s seething, violent surging—this is the *qi*’s fullness.",

      "translated_text": "The continuous layering and piling serve to accumulate the elixir. *Lan* jade, stalactites, and cinnabar begin to take form, their images intermingled, their virtues conjoined with yin and yang. The Green Dragon resides in *Fang*, entering the chamber to complete the affair; the White Tiger stands in *Mao*, obtaining the medicine and returning to the furnace. The Vermilion Bird dwells in *Zhang*, its spirit already merged—these two substances are lead and mercury.\n\nThe \"three and five\" cluster the Five Phases; the \"one\" is the water of *Kan*, the \"two\" is the furnace of *Li*. The sequence of white followed by yellow: white is metal, yellow is the earth’s form. Red and black penetrate inner and outer: red is the countenance of fire, black is the body of lead. When the Five Phases are complete and yin and yang are sealed, it is called \"one cauldron,\" as small as a millet grain. As the *Classic* states: \"The Primal Beginning suspended a single precious pearl, as large as a millet grain, within the Void’s midst\"—this is it. These are the workings of the natural, all the Dao of yin-yang’s creation and transformation, spontaneous resonance and communication. It is not a deviant or false path, nor the side gates of *cai-zhan*, the left-hand arts, or heterodox techniques.\n\nWhen mountains and marshes steam with *qi*, it illustrates the golden elixir—yin and yang’s *qi* steaming together to form *ni-jie*, which then becomes dust. This compares to true *qi* entering the cauldron and congealing into the elixir. Dyeing yellow with *huangbo*, green with indigo; boiling hides into glue, fermenting grain into wine—these analogies show that obtaining the golden liquid must yield the Reverted Elixir.\n\n\"Alike in ease when work is applied\": as *Qian* takes *Kun* as its counterpart, *Zhen* takes *Dui* as its counterpart, then yin and yang harmonize, and work is easily applied. It is not like planting with difficulty or crafting with skill: as *Dui* takes *Gen* as its seed, or yin takes the feminine as its seed—if two women dwell together, how can creation be achieved?\n\nThis wondrous art is clear and true, not deceptive words bequeathed to the myriad ages to come. This book and this Dao are like stars in the sky—who cannot behold them? Like the sea as the source of waters—what divergent streams exist? Though ten thousand ages pass, none can depart from this Dao. Study it in detail, ponder it deeply, and after ten thousand repetitions, you will naturally feel the divine spirits informing you, or your heart’s spirit will awaken on its own.\n\nThe sages and worthies, in writing books, ensure the end responds to the beginning. In the first chapter of this book’s upper scroll, it says: \"Qian and Kun are the gates and doors of the *Yi*.\" Here, in the final chapter, it directly states: \"Seek the thread, trace its beginnings—you must find its gates and doors.\" This is called \"returning to the origin, reverting to the end.\" The Dao of Heaven is impartial, ever bequeathing. Those worthy ones who study the Dao should ponder this carefully.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three: The Wondrous Use of the Cauldron**\nThis chapter originally followed \"Imitating Images,\" for the cauldron is also an imitation of images. Peng Zhenyi said its words and principles are interconnected, its phrases fragmented, and placing it afterward is incorrect. The immortals and sages composed it with profound method—it cannot be lightly altered. Moreover, its lines all rhyme in groups of three, forming another structural pattern. Now, following the original text, it is corrected here.\n\n**Three and five inches, one *fen*.**\nThis clarifies the meaning of \"three, five, one.\" Throughout this book, \"three and five\" appears in eleven chapters: \"Three and five harmonize\" (Chapter 24); \"Three, five, and one—Heaven and Earth’s purest essence\" (Chapter 26); \"Three and five do not merge, hardness and softness part\" (Chapter 32). Previously, the two substances were secondary, becoming \"three and five\"; here, \"three, five, one\" begins the passage to make one thoroughly understand the meaning of \"three, five, one.\" Then one knows the cauldron possesses the wondrousness of \"three and five,\" the medicinal substances have the true fire of \"one inch,\" and thus the proper use of \"one *fen*\" is established. \"Round\" means mastery.\n\nIf one can master and thoroughly comprehend the essentials of \"three, five, one,\" one can refine the Great Elixir. Those who are not masterful in this matter merely cling to the cauldron’s dimensions of inches and *fen*—how shallow is that!\n\nConfucius said: \"Three and five transform and interweave their numbers; penetrate their transformations, and you complete the patterns of Heaven and Earth. Exhaust their numbers, and you complete the images of the world.\" The *Wuzhen Pian* states: \"Three, five, one—just two characters. From ancient times to now, those who truly understand are rare indeed.\" East three and south two together make five; north one and west four share the same. *Wu* and *Si* reside in their generative numbers. When the three families meet, they form the infant. The infant is the one containing true *qi*. Only those who are enlightened can enter the sage’s mechanism.\n\nThe numbers of yin and yang take *qi* as their master; the *qi* of the Five Phases arises from numbers. Thus, the east’s green *qi* is nine—the origin, benevolence, the virtue of wood, the generative number three, and hardness.",

      "translated_text": "The vessel. As Ziyang says: \"The jade pool first descends silver within water.\"\n\nThe center’s yellow *qi* is one, *ji* (the sixth Earthly Branch). This is spirit, the spirit of earth, the generative number five, and *wu* (the fifth Heavenly Stem). This is trust. Laozi says: \"Vast and obscure, within it there is essence; this essence is most true, within it there is trust.\" *Wu* and *ji* unite to form the essence of the two fives—when exquisitely conjoined and congealed, this is the coagulation of the golden elixir. This is called the \"three fives as one.\" This is called the crucible-vessel. When the three fives as one are summed, they form the number nine, returning to the original number nine of the east’s green *qi*—this is called the Great Elixir of Nine Returns.\n\nThe mouth is four times eight *liang*, the lips, two *cun*. Four and eight combine to make twelve, and adding the two *cun* of the feet makes fourteen. Fourteen is the first fullness of the moon in the heavens; the full moon is pure yang, and only with its yang purity can it generate the single yang’s golden essence within the crucible. The mouth and lips are the gate and portal where metal *qi* mutually assist—this is called the crucible’s mouth and the vessel’s lips. This is called the two sevens making fourteen. This is called the wondrous meaning of the seven returns.\n\nOrdinary people, not understanding the immortal elders’ wondrous secrets—hidden wonders within wonders, intentions beyond intention—seeing only the words \"mouth\" and \"lips,\" seek directly the crucible-vessel’s measurements. How would they know that the Great Elixir of Golden Fluid takes heaven and earth as its crucible-vessel? To compare and measure the golden elixir’s crucible-vessel is to compare and measure heaven and earth. Yet they do not know with what measuring tools to compare heaven and earth, nor from where to begin such measurement.\n\nHow would they know that the method of elixir refinement takes heaven and earth as the furnace and yin and yang as the fire? This is called the furnace-fire. It is like the human body—a small heaven and earth—taking the body as the furnace and essence-*qi* as the fire, not the furnace-fire and crucible-vessel of the five metals and eight stones.\n\nTwelve *cun* in length, thickness and thinness balanced. Twelve *cun* correspond to the twelve months of the year; \"length\" means year after year, twelve months each. If too thick, there is the flaw of remoteness; if too thin, the danger of weakness. Cultivators must know that each year has twelve months, and each month has a time when metal and water mutually generate. If the crucible-vessel is too thick, there is the suspicion of distant hope; if too thin, the peril of decline. \"Balanced\" is how one regulates and gathers it—regulation and gathering mean examining and awaiting it. Thus, the ancient sages concentrated the seventy-two seasonal nodes of a year into a single day and hour, with six nodes per day, each node having three talismans, using only the swiftness of one talisman. This is called the talisman-node, where thickness and thinness are balanced, regulation and gathering not erring by a hair’s breadth—only then is one permitted to refine the Great Elixir.\n\nThe belly, threefold alignment, sits and awaits warmth. The belly is the inner chamber of the elixir crucible. \"Alignment\" means aligning with the moon’s light. \"Three\" means it must be the third day. \"Sits\" means waiting; \"awaits\" means arrival; \"warmth\" means yang *qi* stirring. What is meant by \"aligning with the moon’s light\"? The moon in the heavens is called the Great Yin. Every month on the third day, at dusk, a single yang’s light is born above *gengshen*, resembling the *Zhen* trigram—*Zhen* is slight yang riding two yins. The elixir crucible is the same. The crucible-vessel among people is called the Lesser Yin. Every month on the third day at dusk, a single yang’s *qi* is born in the region of *ren* and *gui*, resembling the *Fu* trigram—*Fu* is one yang hidden beneath five yins. What is meant by \"sits and awaits warmth\"? When cultivators have obtained the crucible-vessel and encounter the evening of the third day, they must sit and await it, waiting for the fire-*qi* to arrive, neither cold nor dry but warm. At this moment, when yang *qi* is about to stir, one must swiftly refine the elixir.\n\nYin above, yang below rushing. Yin is the water within the vessel; yang is the fire within the crucible. Water above, fire below—water and fire thus intermingle. Yin above, yang below—earth and heaven in harmony. As the Elder Ziyang says: \"Though it be the host, I am the guest.\"\n\nBeginning and end with martial fire, the middle with civil fire. The first seventy days are the time of refining the self with martial fire. The final thirty days are the time of warming and nurturing with martial fire. In between, one practices the civil fire of a single talisman to refine the elixir. The initial seventy days of accumulated effort are the most difficult. The final thirty days refer to the time of warming and nurturing, which must be especially cautious. Seven days plus three decades, totaling two hundred and six, together make three hundred and sixty—the complete cycle of four nines, a full year’s days. Dividing three hundred and sixty days into seven parts for refining the self and three parts for warming and nurturing, if warming and nurturing last a year, then first refine the self for three years. Only the civil fire of elixir refinement in the middle requires half an hour. Thus, it is said that skillful regulation and balance in elixir refinement use half an hour’s single talisman civil fire, which is not included in the seventy, thirty, or two hundred and six. Scholars must carefully consider the words \"beginning,\" \"end,\" \"start,\" and \"finish\"—the civil fire in the middle stands apart and does not interfere.\n\nOrdinary people, seeing only the phrases \"seventy days\" and \"three decades,\" all assume a division of three parts civil and seven parts martial. How would they realize that the elixir classics conceal their mechanisms and dare not speak plainly? If one thoroughly understands that the moment of a single talisman is the time for obtaining the elixir, then the civil fire in the middle will naturally be guarded.\n\nYin fire, white sprout, lead—two sevens gather to assist and protect the person. Earth two generates fire; heaven seven completes cinnabar—this is the completion number of yin fire, one seven. Heaven one generates water; earth six completes lead—this is the combination number of the yellow sprout, one seven. Combining the numbers of lead and fire makes two sevens gather. Two sevens make fourteen. Using this fourteen of lead and fire to guard the crucible-vessel, its work assists and protects the person to form the elixir.\n\nNourishing the brain, stabilizing the mysterious ascent, the child dwells in the center, peacefully abiding. Coming and going, wandering without leaving the gate, gradually the great nature becomes pure, returning to the One, reverting to the original source. With good love and respect like ruler and minister, after one cycle, the effort is most arduous. Guard closely, guard closely—do not lose the way on the distant, dark, and mysterious path. If one attains this, heaven and earth’s knife and trowel will moisten the pure soul and spirit, obtaining long life and dwelling in the immortal village.\n\nThose who delight in the Dao seek its root, carefully weighing the five phases, determining the exact proportions. Reflect deeply—no need to discuss further. Conceal and guard, do not leak the text.\n\nThis passage, in simple terms, speaks of those who have obtained the medicine—there must be no laziness, not even for a moment, constantly and diligently exhorted. Each sentence is clear and needs no further explanation. Once the elixir is formed and the infant gradually grows, one may then undertake the nine-year upward work.\n\nRiding a white crane, driving dragon scales, roaming the Great Void, paying homage to the Immortal Lords, receiving celestial charts, and being titled a Perfected One—these are matters of elixir completion, Dao attainment, work fulfillment, and merit accomplished. Yet when merit is lofty and virtue weighty, the effects cannot be fully described. Because the supreme Dao is treasured by heaven above, and good roots and superior wisdom practice diligently without ceasing, cultivating both nature and life, refining both form and spirit, uniting with the Dao and becoming true—virtue is weighty, merit is lofty. This is like the words of earnest praise: paying homage to the Immortal Lords and being titled a Perfected One.\n\nEvery person can accomplish this great merit and attain this great freedom. Do not abandon yourself because the task is difficult; do not refrain because conditions are shallow. Laozi, Zhang, and Ge were also human—they did not fall from the heavens. Śākyamuni and Bodhidharma were also human—they did not well up from the earth. With firm resolve and courageous effort, all things are easily accomplished. Cultivators and scholars, think deeply and strive diligently.",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Thirty-Four: Mending Omissions and Filling Gaps**\n\nThose who expound the *Cantong Qi* often present its outlines but fail to maintain purity and unity, drifting into prolixity while neglecting finer precautions. Omissions and deficiencies remain, as if in shadow. Now, I have once more compiled and recorded this to mend gaps, refine profundities, and draw connections to ensure coherence—so that intent aligns and the path remains unobstructed. Thus, I compose this chapter, arranging the three phases in order, wherein the *Book of Changes*’ principles of nature and destiny are fully revealed.\n\n**乙** (Floating Right) – **丁** (Civil Fire)\n**己** (Substance) – **辛** (Worldly Silver) – **癸** (True Lead)\nFive positions harmonize:\nThree Wood, Two Fire, Five Earth, Four Metal, One Water.\n\n**甲** (Sinking Left) – **丙** (Martial Fire)\n**戊** (Elixir) – **庚** (Worldly Gold) – **壬** (True Mercury)\nEach has its counterpart.\n\nThe *Book of Changes*’ nature and destiny adhere to their measures; the Yellow Emperor and Laozi thoroughly investigated and mastered the art of furnace and fire, grounding it in truth. The Three Ways emerge from the One, their paths branching like stems, leaves, flowers, and fruit—yet all depend on the root. Do not lose the original simplicity. What I speak is sincere and without error.\n\nLike the winter solstice, when bamboo and trees wither, aiding yang’s ascent, the wise traveler conceals himself deeply. Follow the seasons, seal your mouth, and refrain from discoursing on the Dao—its vastness is boundless, its profundity formless, its emptiness beyond perception. Only through restraint can errors and failures be dispelled, lest words rebound to one’s own harm.\n\nI now distinguish these Four Symbols to enlighten later generations, who might otherwise remain blind. This chapter mends omissions while preserving oral secrets, veiled yet present. Those who annotate this should grasp the intent behind \"capturing the unicorn.\" Moreover, the admonitions—*\"Seal your mouth, refrain from discourse\"* and *\"Words rebound to one’s own harm\"*—double the clarity, extending its meaning far indeed.\n\nThis scripture grants great liberation and great spiritual power. Whoever hears it will be unharmed by serpents or tigers; whoever recites it will be untouched by plague or dysentery; whoever understands it will not be bound by hell; whoever practices it will find heaven’s bliss. Where this scripture resides, golden light constantly crisscrosses the void, and empty chambers grow bright. Those who witness it gain longevity—six times six [years]. To venerate and believe in it brings boundless blessings; how much more so for those who cultivate it diligently?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Five: Self-Narrative and Introduction to Later Chapters**\n\nI, a humble rustic dwelling in a secluded valley, cling to simplicity and disdain worldly glory. Sheltered in obscurity, I disregard fame and profit, holding fast to tranquility, seeking peace in quietude. Thus, I composed this text, singing of the *Book of Changes* and the Three Sages’ bequeathed words. Examining its intent, I find unity in shared discourse, striving to align with principle, illuminating the spirit so that its transformations flow freely, bringing harmony to the four seas and setting an example for ten thousand generations to follow.\n\nTo govern, one must first cultivate the inner self, nurturing nature through the Yellow Emperor and Laozi’s natural Way, embodying profound virtue, returning to the root, and reverting to the origin—all near at heart, never apart from oneself. Embrace the One without deviation, and longevity is assured. Combine this with the ingestion of [elixirs]: male and female [principles], the expulsion of Wudu’s eight minerals, and the rejection of common treasures. Three methods branch from one source, bearing different names yet emerging from the same gate. This is no mere accumulation of parallel phrases; this text holds truth. Let those who spread falsehoods be shamed by their excesses.\n\nI entitle this the *Cantong Qi*, though its opening is modest in words, its meaning vast. Later generations should heed its teachings, cast off harm, and rely on the mountains’ steadfastness, wandering the vast expanse as neighbors to immortals. Transforming into a transcendent, one dissolves into silence, yet even a hundred generations hence, they will roam the human realm, spreading their wings east and west, south and north. Though they encounter calamities—drought, flood, or famine—while others’ branches wither and their glory fades, the virtuous ride in safety, secure in their path to long life.\n\nMaster Shangyang further expounded this meaning in verse:\n\n*Secure in long life, long life without kalpas,*\n*The Great Dao is hard to fathom—how could the Returned Elixir change?*\n*Fire refines gold into body, earth overcomes water to form the sphere.*\n*First subduing sixteen ounces, swallowing the upper and lower [essences],*\n*Paired with ingested elixirs, returning to the root and original state.*\n*Herbs and trees differ in kind; metals and stones are cast aside.*\n*Discern their use, peer into creation—what the world treasures is this lead,*\n*Pure and refined. Through diligent cultivation,*\n*One naturally attains the sages’ treasure.*\n\nThe *Golden Scripture* accumulates merit and forges karmic bonds.
