  "full_translation": "**High Supreme Daoist Scripture of the Celestial Palace: The *Zishu* Scripture of the High Supreme Daoist Sovereign of the Jade Purity**\n\n**Author Unknown**, composed approximately in the late Northern Song or early Southern Song dynasty.\nA scripture of the **Shenxiao** Daoist sect. Twelve volumes.\nSource of the base text: *Zhengtong Daozang* Canon, First Proper Division.\n\n**Preface to the *Zishu* Scripture of the High Supreme Daoist Sovereign of the Celestial Palace**\n\nIn antiquity, before the **Great Void** (*Taikong*) was formed and the **original *qi*** (*yuánqì*) emerged,\nthe **Original Beginning Heavenly Sovereign** (*Yuánshǐ Tiānwáng*), as progenitor of the **vast and boundless Great Brahman** (*hàománg dàfán*), condensed his spirit and conceived a form, named it **Hundun** (混沌).\nWhen **Hundun** was dispersed, the **original *qi*** of heaven and earth, within and without, was manifest—then called **Hunxu** (混虚).\nThe **Original Beginning Heavenly Sovereign**, through his transformative power, unfolded the cosmic pattern.\nHis golden visage shone like the sun, his jade likeness radiated like the heavens.\nHe nurtured the **wondrous essence** (*miàojīng*), partitioning the **Heavenly and Earthly** (*qiánkūn*).\nThus, descending from the **Jade Capital** (*Yùjīng*) mountain and ascending through the celestial realms,\nhe encountered the **Primordial Mother of Ten Thousand *Qi*** (*Tà Xuán Yùjí Yuánjǐng Zìrán Jiǔtiān Shàng Xuán Yùqīng Shénmǔ*), the **Great Ancestral Mother of the Nine Heavens**,\nand practiced the **Dao of the Great Cavern of the High Supreme Purity** (*Shàngqīng Dàdòng Cīxióng Sānyī Hùnhuà*), the **triune unity of yin and yang**,\nand bore eight children.\n\nThe eldest was the **Long-Lived Sovereign of the Southern Extremity** (*Nánjí Chángshēng Dàdì*), also known as the **Great Sovereign of the Nine Dragons and the Fuxi Sun Palace** (*Jiǔlóng Fúsāng Rìgōng Dàdì*), also known as the **High Supreme Daoist Sovereign of the Jade Purity** (*Gāoshàng Shénxiāo Yùqīng Wáng*).\nOne body, three names—his holiness is singular.\n\nThe **High Supreme Daoist Sovereign of the Celestial Palace** (*Shénxiāo Zhēnwáng*), with his spirit condensed at the **Golden Gate** (*Jīnquè*),\nreflected upon the world and all beings,\nthe **three calamities and eight hardships** (*sānzāi bānàn*) of all suffering,\nthe **nine abyssal prisons and the Green Anticipation** (*jiǔyōu quánchéng*), where all guilty souls endure retribution,\nthe endless torments that never cease day or night,\nthe **cyclic wheel of birth and death** (*shēngsǐ wǎnglái*).\nNow, with my **divine powers** (*shéntōnglì*), I pity all beings in the **Three Realms** (*sānjiè*),\nand thus proceed to the **Jade Purity Heaven** (*Yùqīng Tiān*), beneath the **Golden Gate of the Original Beginning Heavenly Sovereign** (*Yuánshǐ Shàngdì Jīnquè*).\nWith reverent offerings, I beseech the **Purple Microstar Celestial Palace** (*Zǐwēi Shànggōng*), the **Purple Jade and Precious Orchid** (*Zǐyù Qióngruǐ*) scriptures,\nand within the **Nine Heavens Treasure Register** (*Jiǔxiāo Bǎogǔ*), I request the **Secret Dao of the High Supreme Sovereign** (*Shénxiāo Zhēnwáng Mìfǎ*), three volumes in total,\nall composed of **Brahmanic *qi*** (*fánqì*), the **scriptures of the Nine Heavens’ Great Primordial Clouds and Mist** (*Jiǔtiān Tà Xuán Yúnxiá*).\nThe **uppermost** (*shàng*) conceals the **prohibitions of the Ten Thousand Heavens** (*wàn tiān zhǐjìn*);\nthe **middle** (*zhōng*) conceals the **Dao of immortality spanning Ten Thousand Years** (*shénxiān wànián fǎ*).\n\nThe **lower** (*xià*) reveals the **Dao of governing humanity and pacifying ghosts**—securing the state and bringing peace to the family.\n\nThe **Original Beginning Heavenly Sovereign** thus decreed to the **Supreme Lord of Ten Thousand Blessings, the True Prince** (*Tàihuáng Wànfú Zhēnjūn*), to transmit the **High Supreme Sovereign’s Secret Dao of the Jade Pure Palace for Long Life and Protection of Life** (*Gāoshàng Shénxiāo Yùqīng Wáng Chángshēng Hùmìng Fǎ*) to the mortal realm, first instructing me to propagate it among those in the world who seek the **Dao**, so that they may **wear the law and cultivate**, making it a lasting treasure for their bodies.\n\nAbove, it **defends emperors and kings**, stabilizing the land and ensuring a reign of **ten thousand years**.\nBelow, it **benefits the people**, extending life and delivering them from calamity, so that those who study the **Dao** may attain its truth.\n\nWith **face-bowed reverence to the True King**, one **drives away the Six Heavens** and **subdues demons and spirits**.\nIt is used to **issue talismans and edicts**, summoning and binding ghosts and gods.\n\nAs the **High Supreme Sovereign** has commanded, and as the **hundreds of millions of ancestors**—the **lineage of the sacred lineage and kindred spirits**—have ascended beyond suffering, one’s **single body is blessed**, and **ten thousand generations enjoy honor**.\n\nNext, it enables the practitioner to **attain the Dao**, achieving **corporeal ascension and hidden transcendence**, ensuring its transmission through generations, with the **law safeguarded** so that the **Dao may flourish**.\nThose who **leak, reveal, or grow lax**—facing the **Wind Knife Trial**—shall not be pardoned even after **ten thousand kalpas**.\nScholars who practice this must **strictly adhere** to it.\n\n---\n**The Great Dao Source of the Supreme Law**\n**Volume One of the Purple Scripture Great Law of the High Supreme Sovereign of the Jade Pure Palace**\n\nWithin the **Great Luo Purple Treasury of the Nine Heavens**, there exist **all the celestial bureaus**.\nThe **assemblies of the Celestial Emperors**, the **Heavenly Sovereign’s Gate**—with **twelve thousand eight hundred** subordinate domains, each with its officials—**examine the virtues and transgressions of mortals**, recording none in official registers, yet all as **retribution or reward**.\nThus, **poverty and wealth, nobility and ignominy, longevity and early death** are not granted or withheld by decree, but arise entirely from **one’s own karmic summoning and response**.\n\nThese bureaus and gates **acknowledge the Jade Emperor of the Boundless Heaven as their sovereign**.\nYet the **High Supreme Sovereign of the Jade Pure Palace**, now commissioned by the Jade Emperor as the **Human Sovereign**, oversees the **Jade Pure Bureau of the High Supreme Sovereign**.\nMoreover, he governs **all earthly mountain and ghostly spirits**, differing from the **edicts of the Great Emperor of the Northern Pole, the Purple Microstar**, and is not the **mixed primal virtue of the Supreme Emperor’s Three Heavens Exalted Teaching and Auxiliary Dao Master’s secret scriptures**.\n\nNow, the **celestial officials of the High Supreme Sovereign’s Jade Pure Bureau** oversee the **seals of the earthly ghosts and spirits**, along with the **Spirit Officials and celestial attendants**, the **messengers and generals**, the **diverse-named Jade Officials**, and the **summoned spirit texts**.\nThis law must be practiced on the **third day of each lunar nine-day period**, when the **celestial officials of the High Supreme Sovereign’s Palace descend to the mortal assembly**. One must **abstain from meat, alcohol, and carnal desires**, observing strict fasting—**this must be observed with utmost care**.\n\n**On the Scriptures**\nThe **Seven Stages of the High Supreme Sovereign’s Dao Scriptures** are now transmitted to the mortal world.\n\nSince ancient times, it has never descended to manifest itself. Now those who obtain it shall **exalt their bodies and preserve their lives**, **cross calamities and extend their years**. Those who revere it shall receive blessings from the **celestial officials**, **dispel calamities and avert misfortune**. Those who practice it shall **repel and extinguish malevolent spirits**, **severely punish demons**. The **worthy and virtuous** must first **pledge allegiance to the Dao of the Spirit Palace**, **petition the High Supreme Sovereign**, and await the **divine response** before they may **revere and practice it**. They must not **transgress or recklessly employ** it. It is most fitting to **strictly adhere to its precepts**.\n\n**On the Secret Keys**\nThe **Spirit Palace’s Dao Scriptures**, the **Jade Pure Bureau’s Secret Keys**, encompass **all matters without exception**, **all beings without fail**. If one **preserves oneself and upholds them faithfully**, then **sitting in stillness, all wonders manifest**; **standing, all spirits obey**. In **tranquility and motionless repose**, one **feels and attains communion**—this is unlike all other **Dao laws**, and no **seal scriptures** compare to it. If the **worthy and virtuous** encounter this **transmission across the eons**, with **fate and fortune** aligned, **boundless and eternal**, how can they not **strive with utmost sincerity** to **invoke the True One’s blessings**? If they **begin with diligence but falter at the end**, **speaking falsely while harboring deceit**, the **Spirit Officials and celestial attendants** within the **Dao laws** shall **record their merits and demerits without fail**. At that time, the **Three Officials** shall **severely judge** them with their **divine tablets**. They must not **reveal these to the unworthy**—is this not something to be **held in utmost reverence**? **Exhortation and warning** are given.\n\n**On the Wondrous Intent**\nThe **Spirit Palace’s Secret Scriptures**, the **Jade Officials’ Wondrous Intent**, are **profound mysteries**, difficult to fathom. Though there are **secret scriptures** to be studied and practiced according to their **prescribed methods**, there are no **essential keys or core principles**—like garments **cut but never sewn**, how could they be worn? The **key** is the **sewing**. Now, the **eternal secret scriptures** are revealed to the **learned and true**. If one **persists with unwavering resolve**, **aligns their heart with the Dao**, **uses the scriptures to sever malevolence**, and **returns to the True Path**, the **celestial soldiers** shall **assist and follow**. Day by day, month by month, one may **ascend to the Spirit Palace’s realm**. When **merits are fulfilled and name is established**, they shall **rise to the House of Boundless Eons**. Now these are **laid out to the left**—how can one not **ponder deeply and follow them with conviction**?\n\n**On the Dao Law**\nThe **Spirit Palace’s Dao Law** was **hidden within the Jade Hall**, never revealed to the mortal world. Now, in the **auspicious cycle of the Jia-Xin years**, when the **Dao Sovereign** assumes **human leadership**, the **mysteries of the Dao** are **unveiled in this era**, and the **spirit scriptures** are **bestowed upon the treasure seals**, regardless of rank, for **reverence and practice**. Though **investigated and expounded**, they **differ from all other Dao laws**, and no **seal scriptures** are alike. But if one **sincerely invokes** with **unfailing devotion**, **peacefully practices** while **awaiting divine response**, the **merits and rewards** shall be **equal to the deeds**. They must not **arbitrarily invoke guilt from ghosts and spirits**. If they **follow the precepts and treat accordingly**, they may **rely on their merits and virtues** to **redeem themselves**, so that **both the living and the dead** may **all benefit from their virtue**. How could this be called **a minor supplement**?\n\n**Oath and Ritual Procedure**\nFor those who practice this **Dao law**, on the **third day of each lunar nine-day period**, when the **celestial officials of the Spirit Palace** descend to the world, they must **use three lamps**, **twelve sheets of yellow paper**, and **compose a petition** to be **sealed with the Jade Seal** and **enclosed**. The words shall be **offered to the High Supreme Sovereign**. After burning the words, they must **prepare incense, tea, alcohol, and fruits**, **offering them with utmost sincerity**, then **extinguish the lamps and collect the ashes**. If they **receive a divine response**, then they may **practice the law**. The **Heavenly Sovereign of the Primordial Beginning** declares: *\"I save the Supreme Sovereign of the Ten Thousand Blessings, opening the **Nine Pure Eons of the Purple Sky** and the **Ninefold Mysteries of the Spirit Palace**. I entrust them to the **Heavenly Sovereign’s eldest son**, so that he may **unveil the heavenly winds**, **transmit and guide the world’s people**, and **point them toward the True Dao**. Those who obtain it shall **ascend to the Celestial Realm** themselves. The **Ninefold Radiance of the Primordial Qi** has **eighty-one repetitions**, which is the **cycle of the Great Sun**. The **Sovereign of the Great Sun’s Ninefold Radiance and the Mulberry Tree of the East** accumulates **qi into the Spirit Palace’s True Sovereign**. He also **leads the duties of the Southern Pole**, together with **Han the Official of the Furnace**, in **molding the Heavenly People**, all **attaining the Nine Heavens**. Thus, they obtain the **Spirit Palace’s Forbidden Seal Scriptures** and the **Heavenly Seal of the Spirit Palace**, and on the appointed day, they **ascend to the Spirit Palace**.\"*\n\nThe **\"Scripture of the Jade Hall\"** comprehensively records **treasures that lead to ascension**, containing **ten grades of methods**. If one encounters this **scripture**, they shall **register their name in the Eastern Jade Hall**, and on the appointed day, they shall **ascend to the True Realm**. This **scripture** is **guarded by ten thousand Golden Spirit Children** and **one thousand Heavenly Pure Consorts**, who **constantly protect it**. When **incense is burned and scriptures are scattered**, they **record merits and demerits**. If there is **any slight transgression**, even the **Seven Ancestors** shall **suffer the divine punishment of the Spirit Prison**. The **transmitters** shall **deliver it with a Golden Dragon and Jade Fish’s Forbidden Brocade Seal**, **pledging allegiance to the Ten Heavens**. If one **breaks the fast or recklessly reveals** it, both **master and disciple** shall **share the same guilt**, and the **Seven Ancestors** shall **enter the Northern Capital**, where **ten thousand laws** shall **not pardon them**. This is the **pledge and warning** for the **worthy**.\n\n**The Heavenly People’s Fasting with Rice Gruel**\nThe **hundred grains and five flavors** enter the **spleen and stomach**. The **five viscera** are **calmed and at peace**, and the **corporeal demons** are **dispelled and annihilated**. The **Seven Ancestors** ascend to **Heaven**, and the **minor worthy** attain **ascension**. **Long life** is **achieved within the Nine Pure Eons**, and **enduring vision** is **communed with the Holy Wisdom**. **Swiftly, swiftly**—as the **High Supreme Spirit Palace’s Eastern Jade Ascension Sovereign** decrees: *\"This law is taken from the **Eastern Jade Qi**. Again, the **qi is blown**, harmonizing the **hundred bones and nine orifices**, and **dispelling the Three Corpses and Nine Worms**.\"*\n\n**The Heavenly People’s Hair-Combing Method**\nThe **mud pellet at the Jade Vertex** and the **precious essence of the Vermilion Chamber and Mysterious Palace**—the **Heavenly Sovereign’s divine countenance** is **eternally preserved**, and the **divine light of the Sage Forest** is **manifested**. The **right** is the **Hidden Moon**, and the **left** is the **Hidden Sun**. The **six directions are purified**, and the **hundred spirits are transformed**. **Swiftly, swiftly**—as the **High Supreme Spirit Palace’s Great Sovereign** decrees: *\"This law is to be practiced **facing the direction of the Heavenly Qi**. One must **blow the qi** and then **combine the hair**. The **white strands become qi**, bringing **great auspiciousness and prosperity**.\"*\n\n**The Heavenly People’s Washing and Adorning with Headgear**\nThe **Heavenly Pure Jade Crown** and the **Cloud Robes with Glow of the Morning Mist**—the **Tiger Skirt subdues demons**, and the **Golden Elixir is refined**. The **five turbidities** are **rapidly dispelled**, and the **eight scenes** are **radiant**. The **ministers receive their blessings**, and their **guilt is erased while their fortune is enhanced**. They **ascend with the Spirit Palace**, **equally attaining the True and Holy**. **Swiftly, swiftly**—as the **Five Sovereigns of the High Supreme Spirit Palace** decree: *\"This law is to be practiced **from the month of the Heavenly Pure Maiden downward**, with **Jade Boys standing in attendance**. One must **blow the Heavenly Qi** into the **water** before **washing and adorning**.\"*\n\n**The Heavenly People’s Mouth and Hand Washing**\nThe **Heavenly Pure and Earthly Bright**, the **Sun and Moon radiant in the morning**—they **purify my five senses**, and the **light shines upon the Jade Pure**.\n\nThe **Qi** does not receive defilement; the **five viscera** flourish in splendor.\nGuilt vanishes from the **Northern Capital**, calamity is extinguished in the **Nine True Regions**.\nEvil and malevolence are subdued and hidden; fortune connects with the **Upper Pure**.\nToday’s **refined bathing**—all receive blessings.\nThe body generates **feathered robes**, ascending into the **Imperial Court**.\n**Swiftly, swiftly**—as the **Southern Pole Long-Life Great Emperor** decrees.\n\n**The Ritual:**\nClose your eyes, and visualize the **Immortal’s Five-Colored Cloud Robes**, the **Four Beasts—Lion, White Crane**—before you. Let the radiance of the **Sun and Moon** enter the water.\nKnock the teeth **thirty-six times**, face east, and draw the **Qi**, blowing it into the water.\nFirst, swallow one mouthful, then use it.\n\n---\n\n**The Heavenly People’s Entry and Exit Ritual**\nServe and assist the **Jade Pure**, donning the **Paramartic Tiger**.\nExit with the **Sun**, enter with the **Moon**, opening the **Eight Scenes of Clarity**.\nThe **Six Jia** follow the **Divine**, the **Six Ding** march in attendance.\nYou align with the **Heavenly and Earthly**, supporting the **Hook-and-Arrow** constellations.\nThe **Seven Stars** guard and protect;

Union**, blending winds and merging, condensing **eighty-one measures of pure yang qi**, and birthing the **First Son, the Celestial Constellation King**. Next, condensing **seventy-two measures of pure yang qi**, the **Second Son, the Jade Flower Lord**, was born. Next, condensing **sixty-three measures of true yang qi**, the **Third Son** emerged. Next, condensing **fifty-four measures of Vajra-yang qi**, the **Fourth Son** was born. Next, condensing **forty-five measures of flourishing yang qi**, the **Fifth Son** appeared. Next, condensing **thirty-six measures of luminous yang qi**, the **Sixth Son** was born. Next, condensing **twenty-seven measures of rosy yang qi**, the **Seventh Son** emerged. Finally, condensing **eighteen measures of treasure yang qi**, the **Eighth Son** was born.\n\nAll were born from the **Great Cavern Union**, the **Primordial Father and Mysterious Mother**, through **nine transformations of yin-yang**, merging into **one**. **Nine yangs as one qi**. Congealing mist into spirit, blending wind into ether, forming **one imperial infant**, giving rise to the **Nine Emperors**.\n\nThe **seven nines of the Dao**, ten thousand transformations.\n\nAll the **Highest Celestial Jade Emperors** are but different titles of the **Eight Kings**. Thus, the **Nine Yang Heavenly Truths** all emanate from the **Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern**.\n\nThe **Union of Blended Winds** is the **Dao of the One Emperor**. How could one, knowing this Dao, ascend to heaven in broad daylight, while those who lose it forever sink into the abyss?\n\nReflect upon this: the **Jade Saints and Ten Thousand Emperors** attain **True Reality** only by never departing the **Great Cavern**. How much more so for mere insects and corpses, ignorant of the **True One**, yet claiming to become **perfected sovereigns of marvelous Dao**?\n\n**The Nine Masters of Celestial Constellation**\nIn antiquity, when the **Celestial Constellation descended**, the **Three Masters** convened in the **Azure Constellation Heaven**. Now, each of the **Three Masters** possesses the **Celestial Constellation Law**, and together they constitute the **Total Thunder of Celestial Constellation**, within which resides the **Thunder Ancestor Emperor**.\n\n**Disasters** are under the authority of the **Highest Heavenly Jade Sovereign Emperor**.\n**The Patriarchal Master**, the **Highest Celestial Constellation Jade Purity True King of Long Life and Life-Preservation**, oversees **clear weather and rain**.\n**The Ancestral Master**, the **Jade Flower Great Emperor of Defined Blessing**, oversees **plague suppression, exorcism, and summoning ten thousand spirits**.\n**The True Master**, the **Nine-Heaven Beneficent Calculation Command-of-Life Auspicious-Generating Khan Lord-in-Law True Sovereign of Life-Preservation**, governs **soul transmission and ether capture**.\n\n**The Six Outer Masters** each hold their own orthodox laws, governing as follows:\n**The Spirit Master**, the **Responding Primordial Recorded True Sovereign of Command**, wields the **Thunder Decree Tablet**, commanding **thunderous harmonies**.\n**The Mysterious Master**, the **Life-Preserving Transformation-Generating True Sovereign of Life-Preservation**, oversees **the Five Peaks, rivers, lakes, Huai Sea, and cavern dragons**.\n**The Saintly Master**, the **Commanding and Supervising True Sovereign of Ten-Thousand Security**, governs **soul capture, transmigration, exorcism of malevolent spirits, and suppression of demons**.\n**The Treasure Master**, the **Primordial Life-Preserving True Sovereign of Auspicious Reserve**, administers **celestial laws of the Nine Exaltations**, overseeing **thirty-six kinds of untimely deaths**.\n**The Heavenly Master**, the **Law-Master Recorded True Sovereign of Agriculture**, wields the **Thirty-Six Celestial Constellation Vajra-Qi True Talismans**, specializing in **Dao cultivation and official ascension**.\n\nThere is also the **Thunder Enclosure Divine Master**, the **Decree-Descending True Sovereign of Auspicious Gathering**, who governs **demons of the world, mountain-valley five calamities, and the five unrighteous gods**.\n\nWhen the **Saintly Master** encounters **fasting and exorcism rites**, he should be invoked as the **Life-Preserving Transformation-Salvation Sovereign**.\n\nEach of the **Nine Masters** has their own **inner principles**. If an official seeks the **Celestial Constellation lineage**, he must first prioritize **five-viscera essence-qi-spirit talismans**. Once inner essence is exhausted, how can one restore the original **divine qi** without relying on the **Primordial Vajra-Qi** to supplement what is lacking?\n\nOne must first **nurture internally**—only then will the **Celestial Constellation Dao** manifest as **ten thousand spirits**. Our **Celestial Constellation** is the **great essence of the exalted heavens**; it does not wander as the **Primordial Spirit**.\n\nThe **Highest Celestial Kings descend true talismans**.\n\n**The Primordial Sovereign Invokes the Spirit-Symbols, Commanding the Talismans and Incantations of the Primordial Principle to Flow and Govern the Ten Directions.**\n\nTo summon the True Spirit and invoke the Spirit-Symbols, the **威神 (mighty virtue/power)** is unyielding. When the talismans reach the **八极 (Eight Extremes)**, longevity and fortune flourish. To preserve life and transcend calamity, **ten thousand miles** are filled with peace. **Swiftly, swiftly** as the command of the **Highest Celestial Sovereign of the Celestial Constellation Dao, the True and Pure Sovereign of Jade Clarity.**\n\n**Right Method:** Jade Clarity Incantation, reciting the spell, drawing **southeast qi**, and blowing it into the talisman. Burn it with **fiery flames and fragrant incense**.\n\nRecite again:\n*\"Penetrating Spirit, Transcending Mystery, Purifying Heart, Piercing Clarity.*\n*Summoning the Golden Boy of Truth, Invoking the Jade Maiden of Spirit.*\n*For the servant to ascend, True Qi descends and manifests.*\n*Displaying and exaltedly aiding, My Dao unites with Spirit.\"*\n\n**Right Method:** In the **first month**, invoke the **Upper True** (Highest Celestial Sovereign). In the **seventh month**, invoke the **Middle True** (Celestial Constellation Sovereign). In the **tenth month**, invoke the **Lower True** (Spirit-Salvation Sovereign). On the **Eight Festivals**, invoke the **Upper Spirit** (Celestial Constellation Spirit). On one’s **natal day**, the **Middle Spirit** descends. In the **tenth month**, the **Lower Spirit** descends, and the **存局 (Preservation Array)** is maintained. If one’s study lacks steadfast faith, the **Five Sacred Mountains** will test him.\n\n**Incantation of the True Constellation Jade-Symbol:**\n*\"True Constellation, True Salvation—Nine Heavens’ vast decree.*\n*Granted to me in reception, I behold Your radiance.*\n*Refining form in the Southern Metropolis, acquiring substance in the Grand Micro.*\n*The Green Dragon rules *甲乙 (Jia-Yi)*, the White Tiger rules *庚辛 (Geng-Xin).*\n*The Vermilion Bird rules *丙丁 (Bing-Ding)*, the Dark Tortoise rules *壬癸 (Ren-Gui).*\n*The Officials and Soldiers guide and draw, True Names guard and shield.*\n\n*Above are listed the Celestial Constellation Deities—returning to the Sacred Throne.*\n\n**Swiftly, swiftly** as the command of the **Highest Sovereign of Preservation and Salvation.**\n\n**Incantation of the True Constellation Jade-Symbol (Right Talisman):**\nA yellow silk talisman inscribed with green script, worn to signify the descent of the **Celestial Constellation Sovereign**.\n\nDaily, according to the method, invoke the True Spirit, visualizing **southeast green qi** forming the talisman. This talisman is also called the **無邊符 (Boundless Symbol)**.\n\nFor those suffering from **凶惡邪祟 (malevolent, evil, and maleficent spirits)** that are extremely difficult to cure, one must **恰神府目 (align with the Celestial Constellation’s divine vision)**, recite the **總咒 (Master Incantation)**, and draw **巽炁 (Xun-Qi, the gentle and penetrating qi)**. Then, take this talisman to the afflicted person’s home and place it before the **司命 (Spirit of Longevity)**. When night is still, offer **one portion of food and drink**, and **a bundle of gold coins**, burning them—immediate response will follow.\n\n**Days of Divine Descent:**\nOn **August 9th**, the day of **青華 (Azure Radiance)** descending into the world.\nOn **October 10th**, the day of the **True Sovereign** descending into the world.\nOn the **three 九日 (Ninth Days)** and **three 元八節 (Eighth Festival Days)** of each month, one may recite the **都咒 (Comprehensive Incantation)** a thousand times, swallow **twenty-one talismans**, and pray—immediate response will follow.\nOn each **Day of Descent**, light **three lamps**, prepare **twelve sheets of yellow paper**, and offer **one petition**. Use **fresh five-vegetable offerings** for devotion, and extinguish the lamps before collecting them. **Avoid meat, alcohol, and polluted objects.**\n\n**End of the First Volume of the Highest Celestial Constellation Jade Clarity True Sovereign’s Purple Scripture Great Method.**\n**End of the Second Volume of the Highest Celestial Constellation Jade Clarity True Sovereign’s Purple Scripture Great Method.**\n\n**Morning Ritual Procedures**\nEach time one practices, upon encountering the Ninth Days or Days of Descent, burn incense and, facing the northwest, bow nine times to the Three Pure Ones of Supreme Holiness, the Ten Extremes of High Perfection, the Celestial Sovereign of the Vault of Heaven, and the Daoist Patriarch Emperor, Lord of the Teaching.\n\nNext, facing due south, bow nine times to the Ancestral Master, the Emperor of the Southern Extremity of Eternal Life, the Celestial Lord Who Preserves Life, and the True Master, the Beneficent Lord of the Nine Heavens, Master Han the Elder.\n\nNext, facing due east, bow nine times to the Patriarchal Master, the Emperor of the Northern Extremity of Verdant Clarity, the Celestial Lord Who Saves Suffering from the Great Void.\n\nNext, facing southeast, bow nine times to the Highest Celestial True Sovereign and all the True Saints and Immortal Officials within the Divine Treasury.\n\nOffer three incense sticks, kneel facing east, and recite:\n*\"I am of the rank [state one’s Daoist position], surname [state surname]. With deepest reverence, I prostrate and kneel, bowing twice. I humbly report to the True Saints of the Highest Celestial Palace:*\n*Today, I sincerely follow the practice of the Celestial Constellation’s Great Method, devoting my heart to pray that all my countless ancestral spirits may swiftly ascend to the celestial realms. May my own body be secure, my blessings and longevity extended. May I attain Dao and become an immortal, paying homage to the Celestial Constellation and soaring through the Golden Gates.*\n*Thus spoken. Nine bows in retreat.*\n\nIf aged, infirm, or weak and unable to bow physically, a mental bow suffices.\"\n\n**Adopting the Black Practice of the Celestial Constellation**\nEach morning at sunrise, face southeast while studying. Mentally bow thirty-six times, strike the teeth thirty-six times, and gather true *qi* to form the Celestial Constellation Emperor. Visualize the thirty-six heavens’ golden light and jade platform’s verdant *qi*. Within its radiance, behold the Celestial Constellation True Sovereign, with the sun to the left and moon to the right. As the True Sovereign exhales verdant *qi*, inhale eighty-eight times (sixty-four breaths), distributing them to the Upper Dan Field, forming a solar wheel. Then inhale thirty-six breaths into the Middle Dan Field, forming a green pearl as if an emperor dwells within water.\n\nWhen complete, bow seven times and recite the incantation:\n*\"Emperor of Verdant Clarity, True Sovereign of the Celestial Constellation, the Sun Emperor of the Eastern Red Pine, the Moon Sovereign of the Western Extremity—Four Truths, Three *Qi*—bind the verdant luminous light. Settle the Three Fields, internally harboring the True Emperor. Swallow the sun’s essence, ascending golden light. Internally circulate sun and moon, the alchemical hall’s jade chamber. Exhale to form a jade body, inhale the lustrous radiance. Demons and ghosts depart, the Three Corpses perish. Three nines make seven; face the Immortal King. Swiftly, as the decree of the Highest Celestial Constellation True Sovereign.\"*\n\nThis method, practiced for a hundred days, grants the way of *shixie* (corpse dissolution). This *qi* can subdue a thousand ghosts and a hundred demons, dispelling plagues and epidemics.\n\n**The Diagram of the Celestial Constellation’s Distribution of the Solar Yang**\n**The Diagram of the Five-Eon Enlightenment: The Primordial Brightness Jade Calendar**\n**The True Form Diagram of the Highest Celestial Constellation Sovereign**\nAll practitioners shall write this talisman on yellow paper with cinnabar. Visualize the red-black true form binding the *cauldron field* (lower dan field). Facing southeast, within the thunderous purple light, behold the true red form, with immortal officials and attendants in attendance. Imagine the Celestial Constellation within the five-colored *qi* clouds, descending and flowing into the diagram. Wear this diagram atop the hair.\n\nFurther, visualize the true *qi* as a radiant red glow, illuminating all. The brilliance is boundless, healing all ailments. As the true *qi* descends, malevolent spirits submit. When traveling far or entering mountains, tigers and wolves retreat. Avoid blades, weapons, and plagues. Worn for three years, the Spirit Officials will descend to one’s chamber, banishing ten thousand demons and a thousand fiends.\n\n**The Diagram of the Celestial Constellation’s Palace and Gates by Domain**\nEach morning, enter the chamber and visualize the true diagram, transforming one’s body into that of a white crane immortal. Take thirty-six steps to enter the Celestial Constellation Palace and pay homage to the True Sovereign. Thus, in nine years, one’s merit shall be complete, attaining the rank of immortal.\n\nVisualize a golden light encasing the body; each step opens a gate, becoming an official of the golden city. If the divine light is unseen, practice the *Golden City Transformation Technique*: pinch the middle joint of the middle finger against the center of the thumb, extending the other four fingers. Step forward, kneel, and sit while reciting the incantation:\n*\"The Northern Sovereign’s vault is vast; my body ascends to the Yang. Step through the Arcadians, transforming into the Heavenly Marshal. Malicious tongues, blades, fire, and water—all calamities depart from my side. My spirit soars to the Golden Gates, facing the True Sovereign. Above, I confront the Celestial Constellation; golden light shines in all ten directions. Swiftly, as the decree of the Celestial Constellation Sovereign.\"*\n\n**The Method:**\nWhen practicing, draw a talisman on the ground to form an altar. Malevolent ghosts and demonic spirits cannot intrude, making it a blessed site. This is the realm of the thirty-six heavens; diligently cultivate merit to ascend to the Celestial Constellation’s sky. The talisman may be carried during fasting or placed in a quiet chamber. Spread upon the ground, it transforms into a golden palace with jade gates, divided into thirty-six portals, naturally generating golden hues and jade light that spirals about. It dispels evil; even if placed on the earth, ten thousand spirits dare not approach.\n\n**The Thirty-Six Heavens of Highest Purity and True Life-Preservation**\nThe Highest Celestial Constellation comprises thirty-six heavens, each with thirty-six layers below, governed by the Thirty-Six Fortifications. Each possesses nine solar *qi* to correspond with the thirty-six *qi* of the year. Every ten days, one *qi* ascends, aligning with one heaven ruled by an emperor who governs that *qi*. The deeds of heavenly immortals, spirits, and ghosts are recorded by their respective heavens. The virtuous are inscribed in their heavenly registers; the wicked are imprisoned in their heavenly jails. The lowest are consigned to the Thirty-Six Fortifications, where the Sovereign reports to the Divine Treasury for investigation.\n\nIf one seeks to subdue ghosts and spirits, use the heavenly talisman to summon and notify the Sovereign and the heavenly and earthly deities, who shall promptly appear. Present them with the *Wheel of Heaven Diagram*; do not reveal it recklessly. Should ghosts or spirits bring calamity, or dragons and monsters cause disaster, or fire and water bring affliction, pinch the *heavenly eyes* (third eye), place the talisman below, and call in the direction:\n*\"Heavenly Emperor, swiftly arrive! Dispatch them at once.\"*\n\nTo summon, first fast for ninety days, liberating the souls of the deceased, and inform them below—they shall then ascend. This shall be inscribed in cinnabar on yellow paper and distributed with the appropriate *qi*.\n\n「能治万病，解和邪气瘟疫，百神咸听。\n*The Heavenly Eyes* (天目) of the East: Nine Heavens (九天)\nThe South: Nine Heavens (九天)\nThe West: Nine Heavens (九天)\nThe North: Nine Heavens (九天)\nThe *Diagram of the Thirty-Six Heavens* (三十六天之图) and the *Thirty-Six Heavenly Talismans* (三十六天符) are revered by the *Supreme Sovereign* (皇天).\n\n**Revered Supreme Sovereign Talismans:**\n道寂天 (Dao/Way-Silent Heaven)\n阳岐天 (Yang-Qi Heaven)\n洞光天 (Piercing-Light Heaven)\n紫冲天 (Purple-Penetrating Heaven)\n玉灵天 (Jade-Spirit Heaven)\n清虚天 (Pure-Vacuous Heaven)\n微果天 (Subtle-Fruit Heaven)\n正心天 (Rectified-Mind Heaven)\n移神天 (Transferred-Spirit Heaven)\n道元天 (Dao/Way-Origin Heaven)\n太皇天 (Great Sovereign Heaven)\n玄冲天 (Mysterious-Penetrating Heaven)\n极真天 (Ultimate-Truth Heaven)\n梵冥天 (Brahman-Dark Heaven)\n辅帝天 (Assistant-Emperor Heaven)\n玄宗天 (Mysterious-Principle Heaven)\n历变天 (Evolutionary-Change Heaven)\n琼灵天 (Precious-Spirit Heaven)\n左呈天 (Left-Offering Heaven)\n主化天 (Master-Transformation Heaven)\n符临天 (Talisman-Descending Heaven)\n保华天 (Preserving-Bloom Heaven)\n定精天 (Stabilizing-Essence Heaven)\n青华天 (Azure-Bloom Heaven)\n景琅天 (Illuminating-Luminous Heaven)\n丹青天 (Cinnabar-Blue Heaven)\n神极天 (Spirit-Ultimate Heaven)\n安惮天 (Calm-Awe Heaven)\n广宗天 (Vast-Principle Heaven)\n浩帝天 (Great-Emperor Heaven)\n希玄天 (Rare-Mystery Heaven)\n庆舍天 (Celebration-Abandon Heaven)\n天娄天 (Heavenly-Lou Heaven)\n变仙天 (Transformed-Immortal Heaven)\n升玄天 (Ascending-Mystery Heaven)\n\n**Method for the Thirty-Six Talismans:**\nThe thirty-six talismans are inscribed in *seal script* (篆) with *jade* (碧玉), encased in a *golden box* (黄金为函). They reside within the *Divine Treasury Palace* (神霄宫府), in the *crimson chambers* (朱房) and *jade rooms* (玉室), beneath the *Precious Forest Pavilion* (琼林紫石芝英宝阁), guarded by eight hundred *Highest Purity Jade Maidens* (太和玉女). These are the *primordial mystic texts* (太初玄古之文) of the *Supreme Sovereign* (皇天).\n\nThey emerge from *ten thousand kalpas* (万劫), revealing natural wondrous principles (妙理). The *Emperor’s Purple Script* (紫字) is the *Divine Treasury’s* decree (契贤之旨).\n\nThe *Supreme Sovereign of the Eastern Celestial Palace* (东华上相青童仙君) seals the *Dao/Way* within these thirty-six heavens and the *Nine Celestial Mansions* (九霄宫), circulating eternally through ten thousand kalpas without decay, and remaining fresh through countless ages (亿载). Those who encounter them bear the *ancient mystic name* (宿挺玄名).\n\nThey can avert the *threefold demonic calamities* (三对之魔) and avoid the *fivefold sufferings* (五苦之劫). They transcend the souls of the *Northern Peak* (北岳), issuing commands to the myriad deities (万神). They ascend to release the *seven ancestral souls* (七祖之魂) and descend to disperse the *Nine Yin grudges* (九阴之仇).\n\nWithout this talisman, one may only labor in vain over refining the *essence* (精), yet how could they attain self-liberation in the *Southern Celestial Abode* (南轩)? Those who attain this shall possess *refined spirit* (爽灵), and the *One Dao* (雌一) shall manifest its response.\n\nWith the *Thirty-Six Talismans*, one may naturally become an immortal (自仙矣), and all calamities and punishments (祸考) shall be extinguished.\n\nThey may be *received* (受), *worn* (佩), *swallowed* (吞), or *ingested* (服). The names of a hundred immortals (百仙书名) are inscribed, and the *Yin Capital* (阴都) shall erase its records (削字).\n\nIn a *pure chamber* (净室), facing east, perform nine prostrations (九拜), clap teeth thirty-six times (叩齿三十六通), swallow saliva seven times (咽液七遍), and recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Highest and Supreme Divine Treasury,\nGreatly Holy and Pure Jade Maidens.\nSpirit talismans liberate souls,\nPreserve form and guard spirits.\nThree refineries, nine transformations,\nThe six directions naturally respond.\nForever depart from the Northern *Yin Tribunal* (北酆),\nRelease all sufferings (万苦).\nMy body attains liberation,\nAscending to the Jade Treasury of immortals.\nInscribed on azure tablets,\nListed among the Highest Sovereigns.\nWith jade seals and cinnabar texts,\nI ascend to Dao/Way and immortality.\nThe three luminaries align,\nThe nine emperors share the same hall.\nAscending in the purple chariot,\nI am ranked among the Han Celestial.\nBlessings flow to the seven ancestors,\nAll attain the highest immortality.\nSwiftly, as the decree of the Highest and Supreme Divine Treasury King (神霄王).\"*\n\nUpon completing the incantation, inscribe it in cinnabar on yellow paper (朱书黄上), swallow the saliva twenty-four times (咽津二十四过), visualize the *five-colored clouds and mists* (五色云霞) ascending from your body, and let *flames of fire* (火光) envelop you. Swallow it with pure water (以净水吞之).\n\nPractice this for three years, and the *Emperor-Immortal* (帝仙) shall descend. When nine years have passed and the merit is complete, you shall ascend to the *Divine Treasury Court* (神霄).\n\nThen pinch the *Supreme Sovereign’s Dao/Way secret* (掐上帝诀), extract the *stellar qi* (辰气), inscribe and recite the *Universal Incantation* (都咒). Facing the *eastern-southern direction* (东南) with utmost sincerity (至诚祷祝), pray to the *associated celestial emperors and immortal assemblies* (所属天帝仙众), beseeching them to descend their *true qi* (真气) into your body.\n\nThis shall cure all illnesses (治万病). If confronted by malevolent spirits (凶邪), you may also inscribe and affix the talisman. It shall avert the calamities of *water and fire* (水火之灾).\n\nThe *Divine Treasury Palace* (神霄) of the *Highest and Supreme Jade-Purity King* (玉清王府) spans its domain (分域之境), known as the *Divine Treasury Heaven* (神霄天). Within it are the thirty-six heavens (三十六天), each presided over by a *Dragon Deity* (龙神), who summon thunder and bring forth benevolence to subdue violence (兴雷生善伐暴). None escape their jurisdiction (罔不由之).\n\nThe efficacy of these thirty-six talismans is profound and secret, forged by *accumulated jade and refined gold* (流金积玉成文). Their texts can penetrate the *underworld tribunal* (闻冥曹) and reach the *Three Heavens* (三天).\n\nSwallow one talisman daily, and within a hundred days, your face shall radiate with *jade light* (玉光), your countenance with *golden mists* (金霞). After nine years of practice, the *cloud-borne palanquin* (云軿) shall descend upon you. One talisman corresponds to one *Heavenly Sovereign* (天主); three years suffice to ascend into the *Jade Treasury* (玉府).\n\n**Method for the *Sun-Soul Talisman* (日魂符) and *Sun-Soul Incantation* (日魂咒):**\nAt noon, when the *Sun Deity* (日君) is summoned (司命天君), the nine emperors align (九帝齐景), and the three luminaries share the same palanquin (三光同軿).

The body generates *jade essence* (玉液), purifying internally and externally (内灌外清).\nSwiftly, as the decree of the Highest and Supreme Divine Treasury Jade-Purity King (神霄玉清王律令).»\n\nThis talisman is inscribed by extracting *qi* (气) with the *left hand’s five fingers pinching the Yin-stellum* (左手五指掐酉文), facing west-north at moonrise (月出), and visualizing *jade light within the moon* (想月中玉光), channeling it into the talisman.\n\nGather *thousand truths* (千真) to refine it, and let your body radiate with *jade light* (身有玉光).\n\n**Additional Method:**\nAt sunrise or moonrise, close your eyes (闭目), clap teeth eighty-one times (叩齿八十一通). Facing east or west, inscribe in yellow and white paper (以黄白书), and cast into water (投水中). Draw *stellar qi* through your nostrils thirty-six times (鼻引气三十六口), retain the *qi*, swallow the talisman, and rinse with pure water (以净水盥漱), washing your ears and eyes. Thus, your face shall radiate with *gold and jade light* (兆面有金玉光), reversing aging and restoring youth (反老回童). This shall cure chronic illnesses (治夙病).\n\nIf women drink it, they shall bear noble children (生贵子). The *Divine Water* (神水) flows harmoniously, and the hundred *meridians* (脉) shall be tranquil (百脉安然). This practice ensures the *high ascent of the sun and moon* (日月高奔).\n\nThe **High Ascension of the Dao/Way: Secret Instructions of the Long-Living Jade Purity King of the Celestial Heights**\n\nOn the days of *Jiazi* (甲子) and *Gengshen* (庚申), inscribe it upon yellow silk (书之於黄罗上).\nWear it at your left flank (佩於左胁), and the myriad deities shall guard you.\nUnless it is the morning of the Celestial Court’s audience (非朝帝), you must not wear it.\nIf ghosts and spirits do not submit (如鬼神不伏), with the *arrow script* (箓) fire, burn the talisman (化), clap teeth twelve times (叩齿十二通), face southeast (望东南), and invoke the True King (请真王).\nWhen he arrives (立到), all demons shall be subdued (万魔克伏).\n\n**The Stellar Dao/Way of the Nine Suns: The High Ascension of the Dao/Way’s First Sun**\n*The

This is not a mundane affair; it is known as **hidden leadership (àn lǐng)**. After daily practice, if the **divine qi (shén líng)** manifests anomalies, one may then enter the **first grade**. Gradually ascending in rank, one reaches the **ninth grade of the Daoist Cadre (jiǔ pǐn jiào zhí)**. According to the law: *\"This is to enter the Celestial Treasury at night to adjudicate official matters, then ascend to the solar office by day.\"* Now, however, since mortal bodies are impure and cannot fully attain the **wondrous Dao (miào Dào)**, one must first **refine the body and atone for sins (liàn shēn xiè guò)**, **adjust the spirit and gather the qi (tiáo shén jí qì)**, to achieve even slight purity, thus allowing one to practice the Dao. If even slightly impure, one may not practice it. When future achievements are accomplished, one must **present a memorial to the Celestial Treasury (jù zòu shén fǔ)**, **face the Holy Sovereign (duì shèng gěi kuàng)**, and receive the **Daoist official seals (xiān guān luó)**. Wearing the **solar office seals (yáng zhí)** above and the **lunar office seals (yīn zhí)** below, one commands the **divine soldiers and generals (bīng jiàng)**, and none shall refuse. Thus, one attains the **perfect composition of the Daoist scriptures (měi zhuàn chéng zhāng)**.\n\nThe original **Daoist edicts (yuán kuàng)** once feared the leakage of **heavenly secrets (tiān jī)**, but the **Verdant Emperor of Azure Splendor (Qīng Huá Dà Dì)** declared: *\"For all who wish to act, they must first **recollect and visualize the True Sovereign (Zhēn Wáng)** before the **auspicious sign (Zhào)**. They must also **daily draw the qi of the Celestial Treasury from the southeast (shén xiāo qì)**, which is **green in hue (qīng sè)**. When responding to seals, use **yellow silk paper inscribed with cinnabar (huáng sù dān shū)**, drawing the southeast qi and reciting the **Celestial Treasury incantation (shén xiāo jiè)**. The **middle finger bears the script (zhōng zhǐ shàng wén)**. Hold up the hands, extending the **second, fourth, and fifth fingers (èr sì wǔ zhǐ)**, to command the **divine officers and soldiers (shù yòng zhū jiàng děng)**, as needed in thought and deed. When **applying seals to summon deities (shī fú zhào shén)**, **direct the intent while writing (shì yì xià bǐ)**, and **close the qi at will (rén yì yú fú xià bǐ qì)** beneath the seal, **cultivating the left and right eyes seven times (yíng zuǒ yòu mù qī cì)**. The deity shall descend, and one shall naturally know it. **Official seals must be stamped with incantations (guān biǎo yòng yìn)**, requiring **secret mantras (mì zhòu)**, to await **divine response (gǎn yìng)**.\n\nThis method is not restricted to **Daoists or laypersons (dào sú)**, nor to **men or women (nán nǚ)**; all who have sincerity may practice it. To summon the **divine officers (zhū shén)**, one must first **invoke the Golden Boy functionaries (Yù Tóng Gōng Cáo)** to request them.\n\nWhen applying seals and **visualizing the qi (cún xiàn)**, use the **inkstone as a Dragon Circle (yàn wéi Lóng Quān)**, the **ink as Red Jade (mò wéi Chì Yù)**, the **brush as Yellow Dragon (bǐ wéi Huáng Lóng)**, and the **paper as Golden Tablet (zhǐ wéi Jīn Bǎn)**. As one writes, **close the qi (bǐ qì)** and **focus the intent (zhù xiǎng)**, forming the **Golden Seal (jīn zhuàn)**. **Visualize the Five Stars of the Celestial Treasury (Shén Xiāo Jù Wǔ Xīng)** descending as **threads of light (sī máng)** into the seals. With water, **send them forth (shuǐ sòng zhī)**, and the **Five Stars shall stand in attendance (wǔ chén shì lì)**.\n\n**Subduing Demons and Dispelling Ghosts (Fú Mó Xiāo Guǐ):**\nThe **Verdant Emperor of Azure Splendor (Qīng Huá Dà Dì)** said: *\"I see demons and ghosts intermingling, now not subjugated by the **Forest of the Dao (Lín Zhì Dòng)**, causing harm to mortals and bringing calamity and illness.\"* By fortune, the **True Sovereign (Zhēn Wáng)** has appeared; I pray for **Your compassionate mercy (yán bèi cuí mǐn)**.\n\nThe **Verdant Emperor** further declared: *\"The human heart governs all transformations (wàn huà). If one **harbors the divine spirit (cún qì shén)**, the spirit abides within the heart, governed by all transformations. If one **knows the divine spirit (rú zhī qì shén)**, the spirit guards the person. If one **does not know the divine spirit (zǐ bù zhī qì shén)**, the spirit departs from the person. If one **does not harbor the divine spirit (zǐ bù cún qì shén)**, the spirit returns to the person—this is the spirit’s nature.\"* The **Three Officials (Sān Guān)** lament, and the **Five Deities (Wǔ Shén)** depart the body. This is when **demons arise from within (mó cóng nèi qǐ)** and **ghosts come from without (guǐ cóng wài lái)**. When demons and ghosts rejoice, the **divine qi becomes a thief (shén biàn wéi zéi)**. **Life and death are inscribed in the left and right seals (zuò shēng míng yú zuǒ qiè, zhù sǐ luó yú yòu gōng)**. **Illness and injury invade the body (jí bìng lái shāng)**, how much more so to **prolong one’s distant lifespan (yǐ yán xiá shòu)**? I now beseech Your mercy and **explain the supreme Daoist method of Subduing Demons and Dispelling Ghosts (Wú Jí Jìn Mó Xiāo Guǐ zhī Dào)**. You must **listen attentively and receive it with reverence (mì tīng jìng xìn shòu zhī)**, not revealing it to the unworthy.\n\nWith this method, **all demons shall be banished (pì chú wàn mó)**, and the **three calamities (sān zāi)** shall not afflict you. The **nine adversities (jiǔ héng)** shall not invade, and **ten thousand ghosts and myriad fiends (wàn guǐ qiān yāo)** shall forever dare not approach.\n\n**The Five-Star Demon-Subduing Method (Fú Mó

Offer incense and declare to the Three Pure Ones, the Supreme Thunder Sovereign.\n\nThen, establish the altar to sacrifice to the Thunder God, and devoutly pray. Step through the *Dou* formation, pinch the Five Thunder seals, close the eyes, and visualize the Four Peach Dragon Kings’ troops emerging with the Thunder God. Spit water and recite the secret, shouting angrily: *\"Thunder God, swiftly go and exterminate!\"*\nImagine the deity departing ten thousand *li* away.

one falls into torment.\n   Those who uphold this precept attain the fruit of purity.\n\n7. **The Universal Aid Sovereign of the Lang Constellation, the Flying Green Primordial Key** proclaims the **Precept of Caution**.\n   Reflect that all beings strive with wisdom.\n   Do not assume ignorance justifies hatred or jealousy.\n\n---\n\n8. **The Double Splendor Sovereign of the Purple Constellation** proclaims the **Precept of Guarding and Protecting**.\n   Reflect that the **Thunderous Deity** guards and protects with awe-inspiring radiance.\n   If entering a **Treasure Mountain**, one must concentrate the mind and remain unmoved.\n   Do not assume that those of different **Dao/Way** are unworthy of association or shared dwelling.\n   Interfering with **evil paths** leads to **slackening and retreat**.\n   Those who uphold this precept attain the fruit of **steadfastness**.\n\n9. **The Most Wondrous Void Sovereign of the Central Constellation** proclaims the **Precept of Benefiting Others**.\n   Reflect that within the **dusty world**, all beings—**sentient life**—receive retribution according to their deeds, enduring manifold **sufferings**.\n   Thus, one must arouse the **Great Compassion and Mercy**, employing **skillful means** to rescue and liberate them.\n   Even for minor kindnesses, one must accumulate them diligently, avoiding **procrastination** or **indulgence in neglect**.\n   Those who uphold this precept attain the fruit of **fulfilling the True Primordial Essence**.\n\nThe **True King** declares:\nFrom the **Nine Precepts of the Great Primordial** above, if one can **begin and end** by upholding them, **never slackening** throughout life, **internalizing** the suppression of **demons and bewitchments**, and **externalizing** the gathering of **True Spirits**, while **observing strict fasts** and **purifying thoughts**, advancing in **superior Dao/Way**, then all **wicked and violent** forces shall be unable to approach.\nOne may **command the Six Ding** to **ward off** and **banish** all evils.\nWhen the **merit is complete** and the **fruit is fulfilled**, one shall **ascend to immortality in broad daylight**.\n\nHow can one not uphold these precepts? How can one not strive?\n\n**Daoists** observing **fasts** and **ritual conduct** must **report to the Sacred Pass** and **White Court**.\nThe **Superintendent of Rituals** and **Ceremonial Masters** shall **bow three times** before exiting, and do likewise upon returning.\nThose who violate this shall be **reprimanded by the Master** and **punished without reprieve**.\n\n**Procedures of the Jade Bureau**:\nWhen commoners submit petitions to **exorcise maddening and malevolent spirits**, one must **investigate thoroughly**, ensuring the presence of **ghosts or bandits**.\nAfter judging the petition, **offer incense** and **recite aloud** to the **Ancestral Master, Sect Master, and True Master**, requesting them to **announce to the Divine Bureau Officials and Soldiers**, awaiting their deployment.\n\nUpon completion, **write a decree** and dispatch **the Left and Right Grand Generals and their troops of ten thousand** to the afflicted household first. They shall **encircle the dwelling** and send **two divine talismans**.\nThe **Generals** shall command the **Gods of Destiny** to **urgently seize the malevolent ghosts and bandits** within the petitioner’s body, **forbidding them to flee**, and await further orders.\n\nIf the malevolent person is outside, **immediately convene the local community** and **urgently press them into the household**.\nThe **Exorcist** shall summon the **Divine Generals and troops** to return the petitioner home, preparing **incense and offerings**.\nUpon arriving at the afflicted household, the **Exorcist** shall **recite the Six Ding Talisman**—the **Master’s Talisman**—and **assign the petitioner as the Chief General of the Current Bureau** to capture the malevolent spirits.\nThen, **burn one talisman**, leading the **Divine Soldiers and Officials** in a **ten-thousand-strong army**, with **drums and gongs** resounding, **encircling the afflicted** from all four directions, **binding above and below** the malevolent ghosts.\nWith **步禹步 (Bu Yu Bu)**, proceed to the afflicted’s residence, **directly to the Heavenly Gate**.\nRecite the **Heavenly Ding Talisman**; the **petitioner** shall be a **Heavenly Ding Warrior**.\nUpon sighting the malevolent person, **recite the Combat Talisman**, the **Thunderfire Talisman**, and **burn the Lightning Talisman** to **seize malevolent spirits**, directing the flames to the doorstep.\nAgain with **步禹步 (Bu Yu Bu)**, enter with the **left hand reciting the Talismans of the Tiger, Rabbit, and Horse Hours**, and the **right hand reciting the Combat Talisman**.\nAssign the **two Combat Talismans** to the head, with the **□罡星 (Gang Star)** pointing forward.\nAt the hall, the **Exorcist** stands **back to the □ (Gui), facing the Gang Star**, **offers incense**, and commands the **Divine Generals and Soldiers** to **urgently seize and bind the malevolent spirits**, awaiting their response.\nThen, **order them to be carried out** and apply the **Heavenly Ding Talisman** to **bind the malevolent spirits**, along with the **Divine Warriors and Talismans** previously summoned.\nAt first sight of the afflicted, the **left hand recites the Heavenly Ding Binding Talisman**, and the **right hand recites the Combat Talisman**, using the **left hand’s Talisman to strike the lower ribs**.\nThe **left fist** becomes the **Gang Star**, the **right elbow** the **□ (Gui) Star**, the **left shoulder** the **□ (Gui)**, the **heart** the **□ (Gui)**, the **right shoulder** the **□ (Gui)**, the **right elbow** the **□ (Gui)**, and the **right fist** the **□ (Gui) Star**.\nWhen the **stars’ radiance** fills the chest, the **left hand recites the Chenwen Talisman**, and the **Exorcist** shouts:\n*\"You are what malevolent spirit that harms the King’s subjects?*\n*I am commissioned by the **Supreme Emperor**, here to **investigate you**—speak truly, or I shall **proceed with interrogation**!\"*\n\nAfter issuing commands, **quickly bind** the **right fist and left elbow** with the **Heavenly Ding Talisman** for **urgent interrogation**.\nIf they still do not confess, **bind them with the Heavenly Ding Seal** and **pierce their mouth** with the **Golden Staff**.\nIf they still refuse, **shackle them** and **recite the Thunderfire Lightning Talisman**—they shall **speak immediately**.\nAfter **three thorough interrogations**, if the truth is confirmed, **order the Divine Generals to seize the ghosts and bandits**, and **immediately grant relief** to the afflicted, giving them the **talisman to swallow**.\n**Offer incense daily**, and the **Divine Generals** shall **quickly deliver the malevolent spirits** for **final disposition** and **return them to their proper domain**.\n\n**Seizing Wicked and Malevolent Ghosts**:\nIf there are **wicked and malevolent ghosts**, with petitions submitted and **repeated exorcisms failing**, record the **circumstances** in the petition and **dispatch to the Supreme Emperor, the Three Masters, and the Five Peaks**, notifying the **City Deities** or visiting **nearby sacred shrines**. On a **fixed day**, convene and proceed to the afflicted household, **seizing and executing the ghosts and bandits**, establishing an **instant tribunal** for judgment and dispatch.\n\nOn the appointed day, at dawn, summon the **Eight-Directional Pursuit Generals**—**Yang Shun** as the **Vanguard General**—and **issue the talisman** to **cross the dry and wet** and **fly to Heaven** to request troops.\nThen, **one by one**, dispatch the **Divine Generals and Officials** of the **Current Bureau**, following the same method as before.\nUpon entering, the **left hand recites the Talisman of Malevolent Spirits**, and the **right hand recites the Combat Talisman**, binding the malevolent spirits as previously described.\nWith **步地纪斗 (Bu Di Ji Dou)**, proceed directly to the hall, **back to Gui, facing Gang**, and **shout** to summon the **Divine Soldiers and Officials** of the **Current Bureau**, **urgently leading troops** to **supervise and bind** the afflicted household, the **Five Paths of Earth**, and related deities.\nAll shall be **seized and delivered immediately** to the **tribunal** for judgment.\nThe **Current Bureau** establishes the tribunal, **interrogates and commands** as decided, **reciting the two Talismans**, **grasping the malevolent Seal**, and **reciting the Yin Combat Talisman**.\n\nThe officers and soldiers stand arrayed to the left and right.\n\nSeize the malevolent spirits and hold them fast—like a calamity, they shall make no sound or movement.\nOnce captured, immediately apply the **shackling cangue Seal** upon them, then burn the **Responsive Cangue Ghost-Soldier Talisman**. Next, pinch the **Ziwei Seal**, arrange the **Hexagram of Heaven (乾)** and deploy the **Combat Array**. Shout aloud while reciting the **Ziwei Incantation to the Heavenly and Earthly Spirits**, commanding them to be bound.\nIf they remain unsubdued, then summon the **Golden Blade Spirit Official** to subdue them, grasp the **Heavenly Ding Seal**, and recite the **Heavenly Ding Incantation**, invoking the **Ten Directions’ Heavenly Ding Warriors** to bind them in the air.\nIf no form or shadow appears, swallow the **Healing Talisman**, then press the **Subduing Evil Talisman** upon them—this is infallible.\n\n**Demolishing the Malevolent Shrine**\nWhen a petitioner reports that an unauthorized shrine or a haunted grove, tree, or spirit frequently disturbs the land, bewitching women, invading fields and homes, and falsely demanding sacrifices, the case must be meticulously documented and submitted for judgment. Request that the **Current Bureau’s soldiers**, the **Ten Directions’ Heavenly Ding Warriors**, and the relevant **Sacrificial Deities** assemble to suppress the disturbance.\n\nOn the appointed morning, inscribe the **Subduing Evil Talisman** on four wooden plaques, each seven *cun* long and three *cun* wide. After offering incense, arrange the **Hexagram of Heaven (乾)** and deploy the **Combat Array**, then fly as a spirit to petition above for the cause of the calamity. Next, step through the **Earth-Memory Array** and dispatch the **commander** with attendants bearing the talismans to enter the shrine directly.\n\nRecite the **Personal Destiny Incantation**—*Chen*—and summon the **Spirit Officials**, arraying them to the left. With the right hand, grasp the **Northern Emperor Seal-Incantation**, invoking the **Three Teachers** and the **Great Emperor of the Northern Pole**, leading the soldiers, **Heavenly Ding Warriors**, the **Six Jia and Six Ding**, and the **Crushing Demon Thunder Division** to follow in the clouds behind you.\n\nRecite the incantation, then grasp the **Ziwei Seal**, mentally invoking the **Great Emperor of the Northern Pole**, the **Three Enclosures**, and the **Northern Dipper’s Natural Covering Head**. Again, deploy the **Flying Combat Array**, invoking the **Seven Stars in Crossed Array** to envelop the shrine’s form.\n\nProceed to the shrine’s entrance, fly through the **Heavenly Gang**, step through the **Earth-Memory Array**, and command the **Supervising Officials** to shout each name in turn. The aforementioned soldiers and generals must urgently seize them all under your command.\n\nBurn the **Commanding Demon-Scout Ghost Talisman**, declaring: *\"These are demonic bandits—command them seized!\"* Deploy the **Thunderfire Talisman**, burning it thoroughly. The **Teacher** invokes lightning—**crackling thunder shakes the earth**, flames fill the sky, and the officials raise their voices in triumph as they seize them.\n\nNext, nail the **Iron Talisman** into the four cardinal directions of the shrine’s grounds, reciting the **Heavenly Gate and Earthly Axis Incantation**, invoking the **Four Directions’ successive movements**—thus, the demons have no place to enter. Reward the officials and soldiers—this method is supremely effective.\nDo not use it habitually.\n\n---\n\n**Method for Invoking Rain in the Height of Summer**\n\nA private chamber must be prepared, swept clean and made pure. Twelve measures of wine, one rooster, and offerings to the **Suppressing Demon** division’s middle-ranking generals are required.\n\nWith sword in hand, face the **Xun** direction. Draw a three-tiered altar, upon which are placed wine cups, incense lamps, and tea and fruit. In ritual formation, step toward the **Xun** door and assume the guise of a **Divine General**, sword pointing to the **Xun** direction, and loudly declare:\n\n*\"By the command of the Supreme Emperor, I urgently suppress the **Demon Division**. I call each name in turn and summon the **Five Directions’ Barbarian Thunder** messengers. On this month’s certain day, they must swiftly assist me in searching through streams and abyssal pools. Surely there are **Dragon Gods** present—hurry to [specific location], and save all the people from scorching drought!\"*\n\n*\"Now, in accordance with the law, I have prepared blood wine and **zào money** to reward the **Thunder Division**. On the appointed day and hour, you must govern the great rain—do not defy my command!\"*\n\nWhen the incantation is finished, pour out the wine, and with the sword’s blade pierce the rooster, mixing its blood into the wine until it is evenly blended. The **Thunder Division** generals of the Five Directions will then appear before the altar to receive the sacrifice.\n\nAfter the ritual is complete, dig a pit facing the **Xun** direction within the chamber, and bury the **zào money** and rooster’s blood wine. Place the sword upright upon it, then exit the chamber. As prescribed, prepare the **Rain-Invoking Talisman** and have someone cast it into the location where the **Dragon Gods** dwell.\n\nWhen the time arrives, great thunder and rain will descend, relieving the drought. Then, give thanks to Heaven’s grace.\n\n**Praying for Clear Weather**\n\nIn general, the **Flying Xun** incantation can subdue **Sky Gods**, while the **Treading Ji** incantation can subdue **Earthly Deities**. To govern the **Three Realms’** ghosts and gods, one must not neglect the **Flying Xun** and **Treading Ji** methods—how else could one achieve great deeds and manifest **virtue/power**, if these were mere empty exertions of effort?\n\nFor calming **void-dwelling malevolent ghosts** or **frenzied winds and torrential rains**, and for traversing perilous seas or mountains in times of danger, these methods suffice.\n\nIf the **Subduing Frenzied Evil** method is employed, the left and right hands must be reversed and the steps retraced.\n\nNext, use the **Flying Xun** and **Treading Ji** incantations. With the right hand, point to the direction of the calamity, and the ghosts and gods will collapse, the clouds and rains will disperse, all **demons and malevolent forces** will be annihilated, and **prolonged rains** will not harm crops or people.\n\nIf a violent wind snaps trees, the ritual master must transform into a **Divine General** in **auspicious attire**, arrange the items in reverse order, and then recite the **Flying Xun** and **Treading Ji** incantations three times. With the right hand, point to the clouds and loudly declare:\n\n*\"By the command of the Supreme Emperor, I order the violent winds and torrential rains to cease immediately! You **Dragon Gods** who command the clouds, swiftly obey the imperial decree and disperse the clouds, halting the rain!\"*\n\nThe winds and rains will then stop. If they do not, repeat the method, using the **Binding Dragon Spirit Official** to subdue them—this is supremely effective.\n\nNext, petition the **Supreme Emperor’s Three Teachers**, and inform the **Dragon God Master of Rain** to swiftly forbid the rain. Set the **Altar of Transmission and Oath** in proper order:\n\n*\"This humble servant of [specific village], holding the office of [specific position], surnamed [surname], aged [number], born in the year [year].

      "translated_text": "**Morning Ritual Procedures**\nEach time one practices, upon encountering the Ninth Days or Days of Descent, burn incense and, facing the northwest, bow nine times to the Three Pure Ones of Supreme Holiness, the Ten Extremes of High Perfection, the Celestial Sovereign of the Vault of Heaven, and the Daoist Patriarch Emperor, Lord of the Teaching.\n\nNext, facing due south, bow nine times to the Ancestral Master, the Emperor of the Southern Extremity of Eternal Life, the Celestial Lord Who Preserves Life, and the True Master, the Beneficent Lord of the Nine Heavens, Master Han the Elder.\n\nNext, facing due east, bow nine times to the Patriarchal Master, the Emperor of the Northern Extremity of Verdant Clarity, the Celestial Lord Who Saves Suffering from the Great Void.\n\nNext, facing southeast, bow nine times to the Highest Celestial True Sovereign and all the True Saints and Immortal Officials within the Divine Treasury.\n\nOffer three incense sticks, kneel facing east, and recite:\n*\"I am of the rank [state one’s Daoist position], surname [state surname]. With deepest reverence, I prostrate and kneel, bowing twice. I humbly report to the True Saints of the Highest Celestial Palace:*\n*Today, I sincerely follow the practice of the Celestial Constellation’s Great Method, devoting my heart to pray that all my countless ancestral spirits may swiftly ascend to the celestial realms. May my own body be secure, my blessings and longevity extended. May I attain Dao and become an immortal, paying homage to the Celestial Constellation and soaring through the Golden Gates.*\n*Thus spoken. Nine bows in retreat.*\n\nIf aged, infirm, or weak and unable to bow physically, a mental bow suffices.\"\n\n**Adopting the Black Practice of the Celestial Constellation**\nEach morning at sunrise, face southeast while studying. Mentally bow thirty-six times, strike the teeth thirty-six times, and gather true *qi* to form the Celestial Constellation Emperor. Visualize the thirty-six heavens’ golden light and jade platform’s verdant *qi*. Within its radiance, behold the Celestial Constellation True Sovereign, with the sun to the left and moon to the right. As the True Sovereign exhales verdant *qi*, inhale eighty-eight times (sixty-four breaths), distributing them to the Upper Dan Field, forming a solar wheel. Then inhale thirty-six breaths into the Middle Dan Field, forming a green pearl as if an emperor dwells within water.\n\nWhen complete, bow seven times and recite the incantation:\n*\"Emperor of Verdant Clarity, True Sovereign of the Celestial Constellation, the Sun Emperor of the Eastern Red Pine, the Moon Sovereign of the Western Extremity—Four Truths, Three *Qi*—bind the verdant luminous light. Settle the Three Fields, internally harboring the True Emperor. Swallow the sun’s essence, ascending golden light. Internally circulate sun and moon, the alchemical hall’s jade chamber. Exhale to form a jade body, inhale the lustrous radiance. Demons and ghosts depart, the Three Corpses perish. Three nines make seven; face the Immortal King. Swiftly, as the decree of the Highest Celestial Constellation True Sovereign.\"*\n\nThis method, practiced for a hundred days, grants the way of *shixie* (corpse dissolution). This *qi* can subdue a thousand ghosts and a hundred demons, dispelling plagues and epidemics.\n\n**The Diagram of the Celestial Constellation’s Distribution of the Solar Yang**\n**The Diagram of the Five-Eon Enlightenment: The Primordial Brightness Jade Calendar**\n**The True Form Diagram of the Highest Celestial Constellation Sovereign**\nAll practitioners shall write this talisman on yellow paper with cinnabar. Visualize the red-black true form binding the *cauldron field* (lower dan field). Facing southeast, within the thunderous purple light, behold the true red form, with immortal officials and attendants in attendance. Imagine the Celestial Constellation within the five-colored *qi* clouds, descending and flowing into the diagram. Wear this diagram atop the hair.\n\nFurther, visualize the true *qi* as a radiant red glow, illuminating all. The brilliance is boundless, healing all ailments. As the true *qi* descends, malevolent spirits submit. When traveling far or entering mountains, tigers and wolves retreat. Avoid blades, weapons, and plagues. Worn for three years, the Spirit Officials will descend to one’s chamber, banishing ten thousand demons and a thousand fiends.\n\n**The Diagram of the Celestial Constellation’s Palace and Gates by Domain**\nEach morning, enter the chamber and visualize the true diagram, transforming one’s body into that of a white crane immortal. Take thirty-six steps to enter the Celestial Constellation Palace and pay homage to the True Sovereign. Thus, in nine years, one’s merit shall be complete, attaining the rank of immortal.\n\nVisualize a golden light encasing the body; each step opens a gate, becoming an official of the golden city. If the divine light is unseen, practice the *Golden City Transformation Technique*: pinch the middle joint of the middle finger against the center of the thumb, extending the other four fingers. Step forward, kneel, and sit while reciting the incantation:\n*\"The Northern Sovereign’s vault is vast; my body ascends to the Yang. Step through the Arcadians, transforming into the Heavenly Marshal. Malicious tongues, blades, fire, and water—all calamities depart from my side. My spirit soars to the Golden Gates, facing the True Sovereign. Above, I confront the Celestial Constellation; golden light shines in all ten directions. Swiftly, as the decree of the Celestial Constellation Sovereign.\"*\n\n**The Method:**\nWhen practicing, draw a talisman on the ground to form an altar. Malevolent ghosts and demonic spirits cannot intrude, making it a blessed site. This is the realm of the thirty-six heavens; diligently cultivate merit to ascend to the Celestial Constellation’s sky. The talisman may be carried during fasting or placed in a quiet chamber. Spread upon the ground, it transforms into a golden palace with jade gates, divided into thirty-six portals, naturally generating golden hues and jade light that spirals about. It dispels evil; even if placed on the earth, ten thousand spirits dare not approach.\n\n**The Thirty-Six Heavens of Highest Purity and True Life-Preservation**\nThe Highest Celestial Constellation comprises thirty-six heavens, each with thirty-six layers below, governed by the Thirty-Six Fortifications. Each possesses nine solar *qi* to correspond with the thirty-six *qi* of the year. Every ten days, one *qi* ascends, aligning with one heaven ruled by an emperor who governs that *qi*. The deeds of heavenly immortals, spirits, and ghosts are recorded by their respective heavens. The virtuous are inscribed in their heavenly registers; the wicked are imprisoned in their heavenly jails. The lowest are consigned to the Thirty-Six Fortifications, where the Sovereign reports to the Divine Treasury for investigation.\n\nIf one seeks to subdue ghosts and spirits, use the heavenly talisman to summon and notify the Sovereign and the heavenly and earthly deities, who shall promptly appear. Present them with the *Wheel of Heaven Diagram*; do not reveal it recklessly. Should ghosts or spirits bring calamity, or dragons and monsters cause disaster, or fire and water bring affliction, pinch the *heavenly eyes* (third eye), place the talisman below, and call in the direction:\n*\"Heavenly Emperor, swiftly arrive! Dispatch them at once.\"*\n\nTo summon, first fast for ninety days, liberating the souls of the deceased, and inform them below—they shall then ascend. This shall be inscribed in cinnabar on yellow paper and distributed with the appropriate *qi*.",

The *Emperor’s Purple Script* (紫字) is the *Divine Treasury’s* decree (契贤之旨).\n\nThe *Supreme Sovereign of the Eastern Celestial Palace* (东华上相青童仙君) seals the *Dao/Way* within these thirty-six heavens and the *Nine Celestial Mansions* (九霄宫), circulating eternally through ten thousand kalpas without decay, and remaining fresh through countless ages (亿载). Those who encounter them bear the *ancient mystic name* (宿挺玄名).\n\nThey can avert the *threefold demonic calamities* (三对之魔) and avoid the *fivefold sufferings* (五苦之劫). They transcend the souls of the *Northern Peak* (北岳), issuing commands to the myriad deities (万神). They ascend to release the *seven ancestral souls* (七祖之魂) and descend to disperse the *Nine Yin grudges* (九阴之仇).\n\nWithout this talisman, one may only labor in vain over refining the *essence* (精), yet how could they attain self-liberation in the *Southern Celestial Abode* (南轩)? Those who attain this shall possess *refined spirit* (爽灵), and the *One Dao* (雌一) shall manifest its response.\n\nWith the *Thirty-Six Talismans*, one may naturally become an immortal (自仙矣), and all calamities and punishments (祸考) shall be extinguished.\n\nThey may be *received* (受), *worn* (佩), *swallowed* (吞), or *ingested* (服). The names of a hundred immortals (百仙书名) are inscribed, and the *Yin Capital* (阴都) shall erase its records (削字).\n\nIn a *pure chamber* (净室), facing east, perform nine prostrations (九拜), clap teeth thirty-six times (叩齿三十六通), swallow saliva seven times (咽液七遍), and recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Highest and Supreme Divine Treasury,\nGreatly Holy and Pure Jade Maidens.\nSpirit talismans liberate souls,\nPreserve form and guard spirits.\nThree refineries, nine transformations,\nThe six directions naturally respond.\nForever depart from the Northern *Yin Tribunal* (北酆),\nRelease all sufferings (万苦).\nMy body attains liberation,\nAscending to the Jade Treasury of immortals.\nInscribed on azure tablets,\nListed among the Highest Sovereigns.\nWith jade seals and cinnabar texts,\nI ascend to Dao/Way and immortality.\nThe three luminaries align,\nThe nine emperors share the same hall.\nAscending in the purple chariot,\nI am ranked among the Han Celestial.\nBlessings flow to the seven ancestors,\nAll attain the highest immortality.\nSwiftly, as the decree of the Highest and Supreme Divine Treasury King (神霄王).\"*\n\nUpon completing the incantation, inscribe it in cinnabar on yellow paper (朱书黄上), swallow the saliva twenty-four times (咽津二十四过), visualize the *five-colored clouds and mists* (五色云霞) ascending from your body, and let *flames of fire* (火光) envelop you. Swallow it with pure water (以净水吞之).\n\nPractice this for three years, and the *Emperor-Immortal* (帝仙) shall descend. When nine years have passed and the merit is complete, you shall ascend to the *Divine Treasury Court* (神霄).\n\nThen pinch the *Supreme Sovereign’s Dao/Way secret* (掐上帝诀), extract the *stellar qi* (辰气), inscribe and recite the *Universal Incantation* (都咒). Facing the *eastern-southern direction* (东南) with utmost sincerity (至诚祷祝), pray to the *associated celestial emperors and immortal assemblies* (所属天帝仙众), beseeching them to descend their *true qi* (真气) into your body.\n\nThis shall cure all illnesses (治万病). If confronted by malevolent spirits (凶邪), you may also inscribe and affix the talisman. It shall avert the calamities of *water and fire* (水火之灾).\n\nThe *Divine Treasury Palace* (神霄) of the *Highest and Supreme Jade-Purity King* (玉清王府) spans its domain (分域之境), known as the *Divine Treasury Heaven* (神霄天). Within it are the thirty-six heavens (三十六天), each presided over by a *Dragon Deity* (龙神), who summon thunder and bring forth benevolence to subdue violence (兴雷生善伐暴). None escape their jurisdiction (罔不由之).\n\nThe efficacy of these thirty-six talismans is profound and secret, forged by *accumulated jade and refined gold* (流金积玉成文). Their texts can penetrate the *underworld tribunal* (闻冥曹) and reach the *Three Heavens* (三天).\n\nSwallow one talisman daily, and within a hundred days, your face shall radiate with *jade light* (玉光), your countenance with *golden mists* (金霞). After nine years of practice, the *cloud-borne palanquin* (云軿) shall descend upon you. One talisman corresponds to one *Heavenly Sovereign* (天主); three years suffice to ascend into the *Jade Treasury* (玉府).\n\n**Method for the *Sun-Soul Talisman* (日魂符) and *Sun-Soul Incantation* (日魂咒):**\nAt noon, when the *Sun Deity* (日君) is summoned (司命天君), the nine emperors align (九帝齐景), and the three luminaries share the same palanquin (三光同軿). They ascend with me, soaring to the Three Heavens (高奔三天).\nSwiftly, as the decree of the Divine Treasury Jade-Purity King (神霄玉清王律令).»\n\nThis talisman is inscribed by extracting *stellar qi* (辰气) with the *left hand’s two upper fingers* (左手二指上节), facing east-south at sunrise (日出), and visualizing *golden light at noon* (想日中金光), channeling it into the talisman.\n\nMen who ingest it shall, within a hundred days, radiate *purple mists and crimson light* (紫霞红光); women who ingest it shall manifest *golden and jade forms* (金玉成形), bearing noble children (生贵子).\n\n**Method for the *Moon-Soul Talisman* (月魄符) and *Moon-Soul Incantation* (月魄咒):**\nAt the moment of the moon’s fullness (月中方盈), when the *Moon Emperor* (月帝元君) is invoked, the eight *divine manifestations* (八景) are arrayed, and *precious light* (宝光) sustains the form. The body generates *jade essence* (玉液), purifying internally and externally (内灌外清).\nSwiftly, as the decree of the Highest and Supreme Divine Treasury Jade-Purity King (神霄玉清王律令).»\n\nThis talisman is inscribed by extracting *qi* (气) with the *left hand’s five fingers pinching the Yin-stellum* (左手五指掐酉文), facing west-north at moonrise (月出), and visualizing *jade light within the moon* (想月中玉光), channeling it into the talisman.\n\nGather *thousand truths* (千真) to refine it, and let your body radiate with *jade light* (身有玉光).\n\n**Additional Method:**\nAt sunrise or moonrise, close your eyes (闭目), clap teeth eighty-one times (叩齿八十一通). Facing east or west, inscribe in yellow and white paper (以黄白书), and cast into water (投水中). Draw *stellar qi* through your nostrils thirty-six times (鼻引气三十六口), retain the *qi*, swallow the talisman, and rinse with pure water (以净水盥漱), washing your ears and eyes. Thus, your face shall radiate with *gold and jade light* (兆面有金玉光), reversing aging and restoring youth (反老回童). This shall cure chronic illnesses (治夙病).\n\nIf women drink it, they shall bear noble children (生贵子). The *Divine Water* (神水) flows harmoniously, and the hundred *meridians* (脉) shall be tranquil (百脉安然). This practice ensures the *high ascent of the sun and moon* (日月高奔).",

This is not a mundane affair; it is known as **hidden leadership (àn lǐng)**. After daily practice, if the **divine qi (shén líng)** manifests anomalies, one may then enter the **first grade**. Gradually ascending in rank, one reaches the **ninth grade of the Daoist Cadre (jiǔ pǐn jiào zhí)**. According to the law: *\"This is to enter the Celestial Treasury at night to adjudicate official matters, then ascend to the solar office by day.\"* Now, however, since mortal bodies are impure and cannot fully attain the **wondrous Dao (miào Dào)**, one must first **refine the body and atone for sins (liàn shēn xiè guò)**, **adjust the spirit and gather the qi (tiáo shén jí qì)**, to achieve even slight purity, thus allowing one to practice the Dao. If even slightly impure, one may not practice it. When future achievements are accomplished, one must **present a memorial to the Celestial Treasury (jù zòu shén fǔ)**, **face the Holy Sovereign (duì shèng gěi kuàng)**, and receive the **Daoist official seals (xiān guān luó)**. Wearing the **solar office seals (yáng zhí)** above and the **lunar office seals (yīn zhí)** below, one commands the **divine soldiers and generals (bīng jiàng)**, and none shall refuse. Thus, one attains the **perfect composition of the Daoist scriptures (měi zhuàn chéng zhāng)**.\n\nThe original **Daoist edicts (yuán kuàng)** once feared the leakage of **heavenly secrets (tiān jī)**, but the **Verdant Emperor of Azure Splendor (Qīng Huá Dà Dì)** declared: *\"For all who wish to act, they must first **recollect and visualize the True Sovereign (Zhēn Wáng)** before the **auspicious sign (Zhào)**. They must also **daily draw the qi of the Celestial Treasury from the southeast (shén xiāo qì)**, which is **green in hue (qīng sè)**. When responding to seals, use **yellow silk paper inscribed with cinnabar (huáng sù dān shū)**, drawing the southeast qi and reciting the **Celestial Treasury incantation (shén xiāo jiè)**. The **middle finger bears the script (zhōng zhǐ shàng wén)**. Hold up the hands, extending the **second, fourth, and fifth fingers (èr sì wǔ zhǐ)**, to command the **divine officers and soldiers (shù yòng zhū jiàng děng)**, as needed in thought and deed. When **applying seals to summon deities (shī fú zhào shén)**, **direct the intent while writing (shì yì xià bǐ)**, and **close the qi at will (rén yì yú fú xià bǐ qì)** beneath the seal, **cultivating the left and right eyes seven times (yíng zuǒ yòu mù qī cì)**. The deity shall descend, and one shall naturally know it. **Official seals must be stamped with incantations (guān biǎo yòng yìn)**, requiring **secret mantras (mì zhòu)**, to await **divine response (gǎn yìng)**.\n\nThis method is not restricted to **Daoists or laypersons (dào sú)**, nor to **men or women (nán nǚ)**; all who have sincerity may practice it. To summon the **divine officers (zhū shén)**, one must first **invoke the Golden Boy functionaries (Yù Tóng Gōng Cáo)** to request them.\n\nWhen applying seals and **visualizing the qi (cún xiàn)**, use the **inkstone as a Dragon Circle (yàn wéi Lóng Quān)**, the **ink as Red Jade (mò wéi Chì Yù)**, the **brush as Yellow Dragon (bǐ wéi Huáng Lóng)**, and the **paper as Golden Tablet (zhǐ wéi Jīn Bǎn)**. As one writes, **close the qi (bǐ qì)** and **focus the intent (zhù xiǎng)**, forming the **Golden Seal (jīn zhuàn)**. **Visualize the Five Stars of the Celestial Treasury (Shén Xiāo Jù Wǔ Xīng)** descending as **threads of light (sī máng)** into the seals.

If one **harbors the divine spirit (cún qì shén)**, the spirit abides within the heart, governed by all transformations. If one **knows the divine spirit (rú zhī qì shén)**, the spirit guards the person. If one **does not know the divine spirit (zǐ bù zhī qì shén)**, the spirit departs from the person. If one **does not harbor the divine spirit (zǐ bù cún qì shén)**, the spirit returns to the person—this is the spirit’s nature.\"* The **Three Officials (Sān Guān)** lament, and the **Five Deities (Wǔ Shén)** depart the body. This is when **demons arise from within (mó cóng nèi qǐ)** and **ghosts come from without (guǐ cóng wài lái)**. When demons and ghosts rejoice, the **divine qi becomes a thief (shén biàn wéi zéi)**. **Life and death are inscribed in the left and right seals (zuò shēng míng yú zuǒ qiè, zhù sǐ luó yú yòu gōng)**. **Illness and injury invade the body (jí bìng lái shāng)**, how much more so to **prolong one’s distant lifespan (yǐ yán xiá shòu)**? I now beseech Your mercy and **explain the supreme Daoist method of Subduing Demons and Dispelling Ghosts (Wú Jí Jìn Mó Xiāo Guǐ zhī Dào)**. You must **listen attentively and receive it with reverence (mì tīng jìng xìn shòu zhī)**, not revealing it to the unworthy.\n\nWith this method, **all demons shall be banished (pì chú wàn mó)**, and the **three calamities (sān zāi)** shall not afflict you.

Draw a three-tiered altar, upon which are placed wine cups, incense lamps, and tea and fruit. In ritual formation, step toward the **Xun** door and assume the guise of a **Divine General**, sword pointing to the **Xun** direction, and loudly declare:\n\n*\"By the command of the Supreme Emperor, I urgently suppress the **Demon Division**. I call each name in turn and summon the **Five Directions’ Barbarian Thunder** messengers. On this month’s certain day, they must swiftly assist me in searching through streams and abyssal pools. Surely there are **Dragon Gods** present—hurry to [specific location], and save all the people from scorching drought!\"*\n\n*\"Now, in accordance with the law, I have prepared blood wine and **zào money** to reward the **Thunder Division**. On the appointed day and hour, you must govern the great rain—do not defy my command!\"*\n\nWhen the incantation is finished, pour out the wine, and with the sword’s blade pierce the rooster, mixing its blood into the wine until it is evenly blended. The **Thunder Division** generals of the Five Directions will then appear before the altar to receive the sacrifice.\n\nAfter the ritual is complete, dig a pit facing the **Xun** direction within the chamber, and bury the **zào money** and rooster’s blood wine. Place the sword upright upon it, then exit the chamber. As prescribed, prepare the **Rain-Invoking Talisman** and have someone cast it into the location where the **Dragon Gods** dwell.\n\nWhen the time arrives, great thunder and rain will descend, relieving the drought. Then, give thanks to Heaven’s grace.\n\n**Praying for Clear Weather**\n\nIn general, the **Flying Xun** incantation can subdue **Sky Gods**, while the **Treading Ji** incantation can subdue **Earthly Deities**. To govern the **Three Realms’** ghosts and gods, one must not neglect the **Flying Xun** and **Treading Ji** methods—how else could one achieve great deeds and manifest **virtue/power**, if these were mere empty exertions of effort?\n\nFor calming **void-dwelling malevolent ghosts** or **frenzied winds and torrential rains**, and for traversing perilous seas or mountains in times of danger, these methods suffice.\n\nIf the **Subduing Frenzied Evil** method is employed, the left and right hands must be reversed and the steps retraced.\n\nNext, use the **Flying Xun** and **Treading Ji** incantations. With the right hand, point to the direction of the calamity, and the ghosts and gods will collapse, the clouds and rains will disperse, all **demons and malevolent forces** will be annihilated, and **prolonged rains** will not harm crops or people.\n\nIf a violent wind snaps trees, the ritual master must transform into a **Divine General** in **auspicious attire**, arrange the items in reverse order, and then recite the **Flying Xun** and **Treading Ji** incantations three times. With the right hand, point to the clouds and loudly declare:\n\n*\"By the command of the Supreme Emperor, I order the violent winds and torrential rains to cease immediately! You **Dragon Gods** who command the clouds, swiftly obey the imperial decree and disperse the clouds, halting the rain!\"*\n\nThe winds and rains will then stop. If they do not, repeat the method, using the **Binding Dragon Spirit Official** to subdue them—this is supremely effective.\n\nNext, petition the **Supreme Emperor’s Three Teachers**, and inform the **Dragon God Master of Rain** to swiftly forbid the rain.
