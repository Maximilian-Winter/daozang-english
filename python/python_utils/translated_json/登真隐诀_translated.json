  "full_translation": "**Esoteric Instructions for Ascending to Perfection**\n\n*Scripture Title:* *Esoteric Instructions for Ascending to Perfection*\nCompiled by Taoist Tao Hongjing of the Liang dynasty. A reverent collection of early Shangqing School methods and secret instructions for immortal ascension and perfection. The original text comprised twenty-four or twenty-five scrolls; only three fragmented scrolls remain.\n*Source of Base Text:* *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongxuan Section*, *Jade Instructions Category*.\n\n---\n\n**Esoteric Instructions for Ascending to Perfection, Scroll One**\nCompiled by Tao Hongjing, the Recluse of Huayang\nTransmitted by Lord Su, Minister of the Mystic Continent\n\nWithin the transmission are the practices of *guarding the One*, *curved fragmentation*, and *penetrating the cavernous depths*; the scripture contains the *Scripture of Flying Steps*, though portions are truncated or lost. All these are difficult for practitioners, so I have added detailed annotations to dispel doubts and obstructions.\n\n### **True Talismans**\nThe *True Talisman of the Supreme Ultimate Emperor Lord* refers to the four talismanic chapters, all invoking the *Supreme Ultimate Emperor Lord*—the Celestial Emperor of the Supreme Ultimate, the first teacher of the *Three Ones* received by the Golden Portal Sage Lord upon beginning the Dao.\n\n- *Six Talismans of the Upper Prime*\n- *Five Talismans of the Middle Prime*\n- *Five Talismans of the Lower Prime*\n\nThe *Three Primes* denote the three palaces within the body, each generating its own talismanic script.\n\nThe talismans were obtained by Master Juan upon splitting open a carp, as the Most High summoned the *Three Ones* to guard the form. Using the talisman to summon the One commands it to guard the body, much like the *Purple Script* summons the *Three Hun*.\n\nThe eight solar terms—*Beginning of Spring, Spring Equinox, Beginning of Summer, Summer Solstice, Beginning of Autumn, Autumn Equinox, Beginning of Winter, Winter Solstice*—mark the starting days. Each of these eight nodal days serves as a beginning.\n\nWrite in cinnabar, face the *wang* direction at dawn, and swallow one talisman. After completion, bow twice and recite prayers as you wish.\n\nOn the dawn of the *Beginning of Spring*, facing *yin*, write in cinnabar on white paper, beginning with the first talisman of the *Upper Prime*. Hold it in the left hand, recite the prayer, then ingest it. After ingestion, bow twice. Alternatively, draw all sixteen talismans, cut them out, and ingest one each dawn. When ingesting the *Upper Prime* talismans, visualize them entering the *Upper Palace*, with the *Upper One* receiving them. The *Middle Prime* and *Lower Prime* follow likewise.\n\nWhen writing and ingesting talismans, first burn incense to the left. Many scriptures prescribe prayer texts for talisman ingestion, but here it is said to recite as one wishes—no fixed formula is required. One may also compose four-character rhymed verses to invoke the intent of summoning; a ready-made version exists separately.\n\nWear the talisman on the head, encased in a brocade pouch. Do not tread upon filth. After five years, you will meet the *True One*.\n\nFor talisman-wearing, begin on the dawn of the *Beginning of Spring*. After drawing the talisman but before ingestion, write the *Three Prime Talismans* again in cinnabar on white silk, cut them into three pieces, hold them all while reciting the prayer, then roll and place them into a purple brocade pouch to wear on the head. Only then ingest one paper talisman. This single act of writing and wearing on the *Beginning of Spring* suffices for the meeting; no repetition is needed for other terms—only the written ingestion must be renewed.\n\nIngestion of talismans begins on the eight nodal days and ends on the sixteenth day. For subsequent terms, resume ingestion as before. Each term’s ingestion begins at dawn, with one talisman as the starting point, totaling sixteen talismans—ingestion ceases upon completion. Each term spans forty-five days, each *qi* phase fifteen days; thus, talisman ingestion aligns with the *qi* days of the term.\n\nIn the sixth month, when visualizing the *Middle Dipper*, one cannot refrain from talisman ingestion. The mention of only eight terms here parallels the later reference to four terms sharing a single prayer matter—implying talisman ingestion is still necessary, merely avoiding overlap with the *Summer Solstice* and *Beginning of Autumn*.\n\n### **Precious Chapters**\nThe *Precious Chapter of the Supreme Ultimate Emperor Lord* was conferred upon Master Juan by the *Azure Lad of the Eastern Sea* to seal the names of sacred mountains. Like the talismans, it was obtained from splitting open a carp, though this was already mentioned in the previous section.\n\nWrite in cinnabar on silk and wear it on the left elbow. Avoid contact with filth. After eight years, the *Three Ones* will all appear.\n\nAfter completing the ingestion and wearing of the *Three Prime Talismans* on white silk, face north and write again on white silk, matching the length and width of gold foil. Hold it in the left hand and recite a prayer as you wish. After the prayer, roll it into a purple brocade pouch and wear it on the left elbow—this too leads to the meeting.\n\nIf the *Beginning of Spring* falls in the twelfth month of the previous year, write and wear the talisman on that day, then renew ingestion on the first day of the first month.\n\nWhen wearing this *Chapter-Talisman*, avoid treading upon filth. For convenience in movement or to prevent forgetfulness, one may wear it while *guarding the One*, then remove and store it among bedding or utensils after the practice.\n\nThe statement that the *Three Ones* all appear after eight years contrasts with the earlier claim of meeting the *True One* in five years—indicating not all are seen at once. The phrase \"meeting the One\" does not refer solely to the *Three Ones* within one’s body but also to the *Three One Emperor Lords* of the *Supreme Tenuity* descending to meet the practitioner. The same applies to those who transmit scriptures. Thus, one must first accumulate diligent practice to evoke their presence.\n\nOn the dawn of the first day of the first month, write one talisman in azure ink—this too is a *Precious Chapter*. Once ingested, it is called a talisman; when engraved on metal and worn, it becomes a *chapter*. The *chapter* resembles a seal, with fixed dimensions that must not be diminished. The talisman is like an imperial edict, its size unbounded; here, it is made small and narrow, smaller than the *chapter*.\n\nIngest one each year on the dawn of the first day, ceasing only upon meeting the One. Use fine *kongqing* or *cengqing* pigments, grind them finely, soak to remove metallic impurities, then mix with glue and write thinly on white paper—avoid thickness. *Daiqing* may also be used.\n\nFace north, bow twice, and ingest. After writing while facing north, hold the talisman in the left hand, recite the prayer, bow twice again, then ingest. Visualize it entering the *Upper Palace*. All talisman ingestions to summon and notify the body’s spirits require bowing; notifications to external spirits do not—this is the general rule.\n\nAfter meeting the *Three Ones*, use gold as the medium, nine inches long, four inches wide, and three *fen* thick, to inscribe it.\n\nThe gold used must be yellow gold, with *quality* referring to the base material for carving. Following this method would require tens of *jin* of gold, which is beyond a Daoist’s means. Silver may also be used—silver being *white gold*—and since it is simply called *gold*, it serves both purposes. Carve the text in intaglio like a seal, all in reverse script. Use ancient measurements for length and width to seal and command the malevolent spirits of mountains and rivers, as well as the true essences of the Five Peaks.\n\nThe sequence of seasonal regulations will be personally instructed by the *True One of the Three Origins*. The method of sealing and commanding is intended for summoning and dispatching spirits, but its full procedures remain undisclosed. One must first meet the *Three Ones* before receiving these teachings. This is recorded in the *Supreme Scripture of Primordial Numinosity*.\n\nThis true scripture has not circulated in the world; it is the foundational teaching of *guarding the One*.\n\n---\n\n**The Nine Palaces**\nThe head contains nine palaces. Let us first describe them, arranging their domains before detailing their cultivation and use.\n\nThree *fen* above and between the eyebrows, receding inward, lies the *Shoucun Double Fields*, directly above the nose and aligned with the upper edge of the brows, spanning one *cun* square. *Receding* means moving backward, with the boundary set at the bone. The three *fen* within the bone form the domain of *Shoucun*, encompassing the *Terrace* and *Gate Towers*. The *Hall of Brightness* occupies only seven *fen* of this space. Since both fields share a single *cun* and stand side by side, they are called the *Shoucun Double Fields*. On the left resides the *Azure Chamber*, and on the right, the *Purple Portal*, where two spirits dwell.\n\nOne *cun* inward lies the *Hall of Brightness Palace*, where the *Luminous Youthful True Lord* resides on the left, the *Luminous Maiden True Lord* on the right, and the *Mirror Spirit Lord* in the center—three spirits in all.\n\nTwo *cun* inward lies the *Cavern Chamber Palace*. Though the entire head is called the *Cavern Chamber*, this is its true location. On the left dwells the *Lord of Non-Flourishing*, on the right the *Lord of White Origin*, and in the center the *Yellow Old Lord*—three spirits in all.\n\n*Note: From this point onward, \"one cun inward,\" \"two cun inward,\" and \"three cun inward\" all continue from the brows as the baseline, not from the three-fen mark. Some claim that only after entering three fen does one reach Shoucun, and only after one cun does one reach the Hall of Brightness—how could this be so? The following example serves as proof.*\n\nAccording to the *Method of the Five Celestial Bodies*: The *Star of Stability* resides in the *Yellow Chamber of the Long Valley*, which lies in the human center. Precisely two *fen* inward, the star appears suspended above, its size exceeding the chamber, thus protruding slightly beyond the skin. If the chamber were only reached after two *fen*, how could the star extend outward? It is also said that one *cun* inward spans one *cun* square, further clarifying this.\n\nMoreover, this scripture states that one *cun* above the *Hall of Brightness* is the *Celestial Court Palace*—would there be an empty *cun* above it? Two *cun* above the *Hall of Brightness* is the *Mysterious Palace of the Imperial Realm*, where the *Star of Longevity* resides. These examples serve as clear evidence. Those who can perceive the true palaces will recognize the truth of these words.\n\nThree *cun* inward lies the *Cinnabar Field Palace*, also called the *Mud Pill Palace*. On the left dwells the *Supreme Crimson Child Emperor Lord*, and on the right, the *Imperial Minister*—two spirits in all.\n\nFour *cun* inward lies the *Flowing Pearl Palace*, where the *Flowing Pearl True Spirit* resides.\n\nFive *cun* inward lies the *Jade Emperor Palace*, where the *Jade Clarity Divine Mother* dwells.\n\nOne *cun* above the *Hall of Brightness* is the *Celestial Court Palace*. This is measured one *cun* outward from the *Hall of Brightness*, not necessarily aligned with its exact *cun*. Since the human forehead protrudes, the palace extends three *fen* beyond the *Cavern Chamber* above, with its front entrance and exit aligned like the central space of *Shoucun* below. Here resides the *Upper Clarity True Maiden*.\n\nOne *cun* above the *Cavern Chamber* is the *Utmost True Palace*, two *cun* inward in total. Here dwells the *Supreme Ultimate Imperial Consort*.\n\nOne *cun* above the *Cinnabar Field* is the *Mysterious Cinnabar Palace*, three *cun* inward in total. Also called the *Mysterious Cinnabar Brain Essence Mud Pill Mysterious Palace*, it houses the *Central Yellow Supreme One True Lord*.\n\nOne *cun* above the *Flowing Pearl* is the *Supreme August Palace*, four *cun* inward in total. Here dwells the *Supreme Lord Empress*.\n\nThese are the nine palaces of the head. The latter eight palaces each span one *cun* square, while only the *Hall of Brightness* and *Shoucun* share a single *cun* square. *Shoucun* is not a separate palace but serves as the *Terrace* and *Gate Towers* outside the *Hall of Brightness*. Within the *Hall of Brightness*, the upper and lower edges each span one *cun*, though the north-south dimension is shallower, only seven *fen*.\n\nThough these nine palaces occupy the same head, their ranks differ in elevation. The first is the *Jade Emperor Palace*, followed by the *Supreme August Palace*, the *Celestial Court Palace*, the *Utmost True Palace*, the *Mysterious Cinnabar Palace*, the *Cavern Chamber Palace*, the *Flowing Pearl Palace*, the *Cinnabar Field Palace*, and finally the *Hall of Brightness Palace*—this is the order of their precedence.\n\nThe scriptures of the *Hall of Brightness*, *Cavern Chamber*, *Cinnabar Field*, and *Flowing Pearl* palaces contain the Way of immortals for true persons and have been transmitted in the world. However, the current *Hall of Brightness* scripture only includes visualization practices, with no invocatory methods—it appears incomplete. The *Cavern Chamber* refers to the *Inner Scripture of the Cavern Chamber* now in circulation, which contains only a single recitation without any visualization or application. Though its Way has spread, the true original is unseen.\n\nThe *Cinnabar Field Scripture* is the Way of *guarding the Three Origins True One*, its roots in the *Primordial Numinosity*. Its methods are fully preserved here, with nothing lacking. The *Flowing Pearl Scripture* is practiced by the *Supreme Ultimate Duke*, the *Minister of Destiny*, and the *Central Lord* and *Lesser Lord*, who may also receive it. Though said to be transmitted, it has never been seen in the world. Thus, the *Central Lord* said: *\"Only those who toil tirelessly shall I grant the Flowing Pearl Truth.\"* This is the supreme Way of the *Central Truth*, though these words seem addressed to a guest, and it remains unclear whether it was ever received.\n\nThe *Mysterious Cinnabar Palace Scripture* likewise contains the essential teachings of the *True Officials* and the *Minister of Destiny*, serving as the guiding principle of the Four Palaces. This scripture must be bestowed by the *Supreme Ultimate Emperor Lord*, and it is only occasionally transmitted. The *Mysterious Cinnabar Scripture* refers to the practice following the *Three Ones*; its origins also trace back to the *Primordial Numinosity*. Though this Way is profound and wondrous, and though it shares a scroll with the *Three Origins*, it was in fact the final practice of Master Su, through which he attained the rank of *True Minister*. Thus, Master Ziyang compiled its methods and transmitted them afterward—it was never originally part of the same scripture. As their pledges and covenants differ in rank, at the time of transmission, one need not receive the *Three Ones* together with it. Yet the *Mysterious Cinnabar Scripture* states: *\"Only after dawn and dusk guarding the various Three Ones is complete may one proceed to the next stage.\"* This implies that practitioners of the *Mysterious Cinnabar* may first guard the One, while those who guard the One need not know of the *Mysterious Cinnabar*.\n\nWhen the Ways of the Five Palaces circulate in the world, those with true names may encounter them. Yet without the destined bone and fate, one shall not hear of these teachings. Many in the world receive these methods, but none cultivate and guard them. The deities within the body in this practice differ from those in other methods; they are treasured and concealed by the *Upper Perfected*, and the practice itself is sufficient for one’s work. If one cultivates this Way, one attains long life; if one does not, one dies. Yet this is not a matter of destined bone alone.\n\nThere is also the *Jade Emperor Palace*, where the *Jade Clarity Divine Mother* resides; the *Celestial Court Palace*, where the *Upper Clarity True Woman* dwells; the *True Ultimate Palace*, where the *Supreme Ultimate Empress* abides; and previously, it was called *Ultimate Truth*, but here it is named *True Ultimate*—the order of these two characters remains unclear, and it is feared that a later error may have occurred. There is also the *Grand Sovereign Palace*, where the *Supreme Lord’s Queen* resides. These Four Palaces all pertain to the *Feminine True One*, and their Way is higher than that of the *Masculine True One*. Each has its own precious scriptures, transmitted only to those who have already attained *Perfected* rank; those who have not yet achieved *Perfection* shall not hear of them, and their essentials of the *Feminine True* are likewise not bestowed.\n\nThe deities of the previous Five Palaces are all male, hence called the *Masculine One*; the deities of these Four Palaces are all female, hence called the *Feminine One*. Among the Nine Palaces of the *Upper Clarity* and *Great Tenuity*, *True Lords* reside, and thus corresponding positions are established in the human head to align with them. It is said: *\"In emptiness and harmony, guard the Masculine; in solitude and stillness, guard the Feminine.\"* *\"Solitude and stillness\"* refers to solitary wandering in simplicity. Though one may not yet have attained *Perfection* in worldly study, if the mind remains turbid and obstructed, one cannot cultivate this Way. The *Five Thousand Characters* also speak of *\"knowing the Masculine, guarding the Feminine.\"*\n\nThese Four Palaces exist within all people, but those who do not cultivate this Way leave their palaces empty. Those who do not fully cultivate the Nine Palaces likewise leave their palaces empty—not only the Four Palaces of the *Feminine*. Within the *Cinnabar Field Palace*, the *Emperor Lord* is always present; within the *Inch of Guarding*, great deities constantly reside. One need not wait to guard them to find them already in their palaces. Those who cultivate become *Immortals*; those who do not die at the end of their allotted years. Thus, even in the bodies of the vulgar and common, the *Three Ones* are always present. Yet if one cannot cultivate and guard them, when one’s lifespan ends, they depart, and death follows. If the methods one has received are constantly cultivated and preserved, then deities will also enter the empty palaces in accordance with the practice—not only the *Emperor Lord* in the *Cinnabar Field*.\n\n*\"Guard the One without fail, and when the limit of one’s lifespan passes, there shall be no further death. Until the time of meeting, when meeting occurs, one attains the Dao.\"* The deities of the *Masculine* and *Feminine Ones* may be cultivated together by both men and women without distinction. Only through utmost dedication and perseverance shall one gain benefit. This refers to the *Masculine* and *Feminine Ones*: both men and women may cultivate them together, without distinguishing between male and female. If a man guards the *Feminine*, he assumes a feminine form; if a woman guards the *Masculine*, she takes on a masculine appearance. However, the *Three Ministers* are formed from the essence of one’s own body, and thus one should follow one’s original nature and distinguish between male and female.\n\nThe principle of *guarding the One* first requires one or two years of focused and arduous contemplation, until one attains a semblance of realization, making visualization easier. *Guarding the Inch* is the initial method of *guarding the One*. Examining the prefaces and sequences in the scriptures, the order is not always consistent, with some sections initially undivided, others surpassing conventional usage. One cannot transcribe them strictly according to their original presentation. Here, I have arranged and connected them in proper sequence, extracting their essentials and sources. The large characters are all from the original text, without addition or omission; I have merely organized their threads to allow for orderly reference.\n\nOn the night of *Beginning of Spring*, at midnight, sit facing east. The scripture later states: on *Beginning of Summer*, face south; on *Beginning of Autumn*, face west; on *Beginning of Winter*, face north. The method states: this is the practice of *guarding the Three Origins True One*, all using the nights of the four *Beginnings* (of the seasons). After the *Hai* hour (9–11 p.m.), one may proceed, facing the *Monthly Establishment*. The four *Beginnings* correspond to the four *First Months* of the seasons, not the cardinal directions; the *Five Dippers* divide the *Solstices* and *Equinoxes*, which are the four *Middle Months*.\n\nSit evenly, hold the breath, close the eyes, clench the fists, and place them on the knees. First, visualize *guarding the Inch* according to the method. Above the space between the eyebrows, within, there is the *Yellow Gate*, *Purple Chamber*, *Crimson Terrace*, and *Azure House*, all together forming the domain of *guarding the Inch*. Behind the ears, this is the region three *fen* inward. The *Terrace* and *Gate* lie within these three *fen*, with a width of one *cun* on each side, each three *fen* square, leaving a central opening of four *fen* as a path, internally connecting to the *Hall of Light* and ascending to the front gate of the *Celestial Court*.\n\nOn the left side of *guarding the Inch* is the *Crimson Terrace*. The terrace’s form resembles a square tower beside a city gate, with its exterior and upper and lower parts all made of red jade. In the center of the tower’s upper section is a window, with curtains and hangings all in azure, and the deity resides within. On the right side is the *Yellow Gate*. The gate’s form is similar to the terrace, also square and open externally, made of yellow jade. In the center of the gate’s upper section is a window, with curtains and hangings all in purple, and the deity resides within.\n\nThe Nine Palaces’ Perfected Ones enter and exit through the path between the Yellow Gate and the Crimson Terrace. Thus, the placement of the terrace and gate to the left and right of the Way is to govern the qi of the extraordinary, awaiting and receiving the Perfected Ones’ comings and goings. This is merely an explanation, not a matter of meditative visualization.\n\nThe paths by which the Perfected Spirits of the Nine Palaces enter and exit the head—though there be the Celestial Sovereign’s trusted mandate without, they may not approach directly. Thus, these two spirits constantly grasp bells to stand guard, much like the defenses of a city gate.\n\nAs the *Dongfang of the Square Cauldron* states: “Those who enter through the Purple Door are called the Dipper Stars; they pass through its center to enter the *Dongfang*, not merely through the Yellow Gate or the Purple Door’s inner side.” This refers only to one of its names.\n\nEach of the Nine Palaces has a front and rear door, mutually connecting to the four upper palaces. Exiting from the front of the *Celestial Court*, they descend again to emerge from within the terrace and gate of *guarding the Inch*, then outward. Only the *Mud Pill Palace* has a lower gate, connecting to the throat and linking with the middle and lower palaces.\n\nThe great spirit of the Purple Door is named Tranquil Leveling, styled Dharma King, and resides on the right. The great spirit of the Azure Chamber is named Upright Heart, styled Precise Square, and resides on the left. These two spirits dwell within the chamber doors, and thus are not designated by terrace or gate.\n\nTheir forms resemble infants, like newborn babes, with jade-like complexions, and they always sit facing one another. Each wears robes matching the color of their chamber door: purple on the right, azure on the left, both of plain silk, not brocade. They hold *flowing-metal bells*—fire bells—grasping one in each hand, two bells held together. The *flowing-metal bells* have no substance but glow red, resembling the shape of smoldering embers.\n\nWithin these two spirits also reside the qi of wind and clouds, resplendent in guarding the *cun*-realm of the chamber.\n\nWhen retiring at dusk or engaging in visualization, if one focuses solely on the Nine Palaces in the evening, one should first lie down and visualize accordingly. If it is a night designated for guarding the Nine Palaces, upon nearing the time of visualization, one must first attend to this. Begin by visualizing the two great spirits as if they are present before you. Hold the breath and visualize them in their full form as described earlier. Once they appear within their chambers, it will be as though you see them with your own eyes. Then, call their names and styles three times, intoning at the heart:\n\n*Purple Door Great Spirit, named Tranquil Leveling, styled Dharma King—two, two, two, two; Azure Chamber Great Spirit, named Upright Heart, styled Precise Square—two, two, two, two.*\n\nThereafter, regulate the breath and softly intone the incantation:\n\n*Purple Door, Azure Chamber,\nTwo great spirits stand,\nHands grasp flowing bells,\nBodies birth wind and clouds.\nThey escort and guard the true Dao,\nBar entry to all without.\nLet my thoughts and perceptions\nPierce through the numinous gates,\nExiting and entering with upright harmony,\nAscending through the Nine Portals,\nTo behold the Nine Perfected,\nThe honored of the Supreme High—six verses.*\n\nOnce the incantation is complete, proceed to visualize the Three Ones, the Cavern Chamber, the Nine Paths, and all essential Dao-paths. The Nine Paths are the paths of the Nine Palaces.\n\nAll who practice visualization of the Bright Hall, Cavern Chamber, or Mysterious Cinnabar alone must first perform this visualization and incantation. The marvel of the Feminine One also follows this method.\n\nWithin the Nine Palaces of the head, if there are two spirits, the left is superior, followed by the right. If there are three spirits, the center is superior, followed by the left, then the right. At the outset of visualization practice, one must begin from the lower regions. Thus, when guarding the *cun*-realm, one first attends to the Purple Door; when visualizing the Cavern Chamber, one first attends to White Prime; and when visualizing the Bright Hall, one begins with the left—this follows the principle that the feminine is esteemed above the masculine. Only the Cinnabar Field and Imperial Homeland are transformations of the essence within one’s own body, not ranks of external origin, and thus are visualized last. If the upper palace is not located below the body, then the left is superior, followed by the center, then the right.\n\n**Bright Hall**\nAfter completing the visualization of the *cun*-realm, proceed to this. If one does not practice the Guarding of the One, using this method alone is also excellent. If one primarily guards the One, omitting this is not amiss, though practicing both is even better.\n\nOn the left resides the Bright Youth Perfected Lord, whose tabooed name is Mysterious Yang and whose style is Lesser Azure. Visualize him in male form. On the right resides the Bright Maiden Perfected Lord, whose tabooed name is Subtle Yin and whose style is Lesser Prime. Visualize her in female form. In the center resides the Bright Mirror Spirit Lord, whose tabooed name is Illuminating Essence and whose style is Fourfold Clarity. Visualize him also in male form. These three lords jointly govern the Bright Hall Palace. All wear brocade robes of green, with belts adorned with four jade bells, and hold in their mouths a red jade mirror. Both the mirrors and bells are red. Their attire is uniformly green brocade robes, with belts bearing four red jade bells—one each at front, back, left, and right—and they hold in their mouths the nose of the red jade mirror, its surface facing outward. Though the bells and mirrors have substance, their red glow illuminates all, their brilliance resounding and reverberating through the Nine Palaces. Their heads resemble those of infants, as do their forms, and they sit facing outward or toward one another. All appear as newborns, with golden radiance and jade-like complexions. By day, the three face outward; by night, the left and right turn toward the center. Such is the Dao of the Bright Hall.\n\nIf one practices the Guarding of the One followed by the visualization of the Bright Hall, at this point call out the titles and names of each three times:\n\n*Bright Youth Perfected Lord, whose tabooed name is Mysterious Yang, styled Lesser Azure—two, two, two, two;\nBright Maiden Perfected Lord, whose tabooed name is Subtle Yin, styled Lesser Prime—two, two, two, two;\nBright Mirror Spirit Lord, whose tabooed name is Illuminating Essence, styled Fourfold Clarity—two, two, two, two.*\n\nThen, click the teeth nine times and cease, proceeding next to visualize the Cavern Chamber. If one is not practicing the Guarding of the One and intends to perform only the subsequent methods, one must first visualize thus, completing it before proceeding to the remaining practices.\n\nIf a Daoist—here referring to one who cultivates the Dao—fears or dreads anything, such as dwelling alone in the mountains and encountering malevolent spirits or disturbances of the heart, or experiencing tremors of apprehension, one should employ this method. Visualize the three spirits, causing them to ring their jade bells, so that the sound reaches the Great Ultimate. Visualize the three spirits each shaking the bells at their waists, the four bells, so that the ears perceive their sound, resounding and reverberating through the Celestial Palace of the Great Ultimate. Visualize them exhaling the red glow of their jade mirrors, extending ten thousand *zhang*, also perceiving the light of the mirrors emanating from the *cun*-realm, illuminating the four directions in a circle of fifty *li*, one hundred sixty-six *bu*, and four *chi*. One should first pace the perimeter of one’s dwelling, marking the boundaries to a specific mountain, village, or domain, so that when visualizing the light, it naturally extends to this limit, making the practice easier. Every matter requires such precision, not merely this one method.\n\nOnce the visualization is complete, call the names and titles of the three lords three times, clicking the teeth nine times. Then, a thousand demons will be subdued, and ten thousand ghosts will vanish. After completing the visualization, call their names and titles in sequence as before.\n\nThis section describes the method for repelling evil spirits and myriad demons.\n\nIf a Daoist experiences thirst—here referring to thirst for drink, though it may also denote hunger and thirst—visualize the three lords exhaling red qi into one’s mouth, which one then inhales and swallows, soon feeling sated. One should visualize them exhaling red qi from the *cun*-realm, which descends thickly into one’s mouth. One then inhales and swallows it repeatedly, until fully sated. This is the method for alleviating hunger and thirst.\n\nIf a Daoist travels at night and cannot see the path, again visualize the three lords, continuing from the previous methods. Cause them to exhale three beams of fiery light to illuminate the way ahead, and soon the path will become bright and clear. Each should exhale a red glow, like a flame, emerging from the *cun*-realm and extending far ahead to illuminate the surroundings. Visualize this as vividly as if seen with the eyes, and the path will become bright. Proceed while maintaining the visualization, without pause. This is the method for illuminating darkness.\n\nIf one finds oneself in perilous circumstances—amidst treacherous terrain, the chaos of armed conflict, or when neither concealment nor flight to desolate lands can avert worldly dangers—should sudden crisis strike and no means of warding or defense remain, this method is revealed. Even those among the laity who are devout may practice it, for it is not reserved solely for Daoists.\n\nIn haste, visualize the Three Lords and cause them to sound jade bells. Focus intently and imagine each Lord brandishing four bells, shaking forth beams of crimson mirror-light to strike and repel enemies or malevolent forces. Upon encountering this radiance, their armor shall falter, and they will collapse at once. The adversaries, stricken with terror, will no longer harbor thoughts of harm—*harm* here meaning violent seizure, though it may also be read as *injury*. This is the method for repelling evil and danger.\n\nIf a Daoist seeks to prolong life and escape death, or when illness strikes and deliverance is sought, one should lie down properly, supine with fists clenched, hold the breath, close the eyes, and settle the mind. First, faintly visualize the sun and moon within the Hall of Light, the sun to the left and the moon to the right. Then, as in the previous methods, visualize the Three Lords. Within the Hall of Light, the Three Lords should be seen kneeling upright and facing outward—even at night, they must be visualized as facing outward. Though the body lies prone, the spirits follow its repose yet remain in the posture of long kneeling, as if standing. For while the gods within the body may recline, the visualization here must remain clear, just as the *cun*-realm’s terrace and watchtower admit no turning aside. Thus, though they align with the body’s position, they must be imagined as seated.\n\nExhale red qi, causing its light to envelop the body in a full circuit. Each Lord emits beams of crimson mirror-light from the *cun*-realm, gradually encircling the body. Near the mouth, swallow the red qi repeatedly, without limit. With eyes closed, gently draw in the encircling red qi and swallow it, sensing its vigorous descent into the mouth and onward through the chest and abdomen. Soon, the red qi encircling the body transforms into fire, which then burns the body until flesh and flame become one, radiating luminous brilliance within and without. This continues for a long while, resembling the method of restraining the hun-soul, as the fire thoroughly scorches the body’s exterior and interior, bones and flesh, until they glow like burning charcoal. This is called the *Refining of the Form through Sun and Moon*, whereby the dead are revived.\n\nWhen illness first strikes, this method should be employed to cure it. If one waits until the affliction has grown severe, the visualization may no longer be precise, so practice it at the first sign of discomfort. This is the Way to heal sickness and dispel illness, and there is no fixed time for its practice. If performed every evening before sleep, it will assuredly grant long life and prevent death. For though it is not a lofty method—merely ensuring immortality—it remains a minor Way worthy of attention. This is also the method for cultivating longevity through concurrent practice, a common technique among those who tend the Hall of Light.\n\nFurthermore, by frequently visualizing and swallowing red qi, one’s complexion will revert to youth, becoming like that of a child. This is the Way to avoid death. Even when not treating illness or engaging in evening visualization, one should regularly visualize and swallow red qi, imagining the Three Lords exhaling it from the *cun*-realm into one’s mouth before swallowing. This is the Way to return to youth.\n\nHerein lie the essentials of the Bright and Constant Way.\n\nHerein lie the seven essentials of the Hall of Light, encompassing all methods in their entirety. Only the matter of unspoken invocations remains—though by the standards of the Constant and True Way, this too belongs to the Hall of Light’s tradition, the visualization of invocations is particularly intricate. It is feared that the Hall of Light may possess other grand scriptures, and what is transmitted here is but an abridged excerpt.\n\nEach morning upon rising, one should swallow saliva thirty times, then wipe the face and massage the eyes as a regular practice, visualizing the saliva as crimson fluid. This single method may yet serve as a complement to the Hall of Light’s practices.\n\nThe phrase \"in all cases\" indicates that those who practice the Hall of Light’s method for extending life should perform this daily without fail. It may also be employed by those who cultivate the *shouyi* (Guardian of Unity) tradition, for though these are two distinct methods, they converge in a single practice.\n\nThe *Dongfang* (Cavern Chamber) must also be cultivated in tandem. Proceeding from the *cun*-realm and the Hall of Light, one then enters the *Dongfang* to reach the *Dantian* (Cinnabar Field). Thus, it is fitting to practice both together, without omitting any stage in between.\n\nWithin the *Dongfang* lie the Yellow Gate, the Purple Portal, and the Chamber of Mysterious Essence—abodes where the Three Ones, the Venerable Lords, perpetually reside. These Yellow Gate and Purple Portal are not the same as those in the *cun*-realm but exist separately within the *Dongfang* Palace, akin to the Mysterious Elixir’s Purple Chamber and Verdant Chamber.\n\nThe Supreme Lord of the Upper One occasionally enters this realm, where the Jade Scriptures are stored. The Middle and Lower Ones are not permitted to wander here. When referring to the Three Ones, this is a general designation, and the title \"Venerable Lord\" applies only to the Supreme Lord as the most exalted of the Three.\n\nThose who practice both methods together will perceive the deities more swiftly, for the more one visualizes, the quicker the resonance. The *Dongfang* adept must take *shouyi* as their foundation, progressing from external to internal, from beginning to end, for the root of all cultivation arises from the One.\n\nThe *shouyi* adept must take the *Dongfang* as their canopy of radiance, its luminous majesty sheltering and perfecting their Way. Thus, the Three Ones and the *Dongfang* are interdependent: though their dwellings differ, those who attain the Way must harmonize their practice.\n\nThe Way of the Nine Palaces employs each palace individually, yet in concurrent cultivation, the more one engages, the greater the benefit. Though their principles differ, they do not obstruct one another. The difficulty lies in the scarcity of accessible scriptures and the ease with which sincerity wanes, which is why scholars, though numerous, have scarcely grasped even a fraction of its essence.\n\nWithin the *Dongfang* reside three perfected beings: on the left, the Lordless Lad; on the right, the White Prime Lord; and in the center, the Yellow Elder Lord. Together, they govern the *Dongfang*, and this is the Way of Ascending Perfection, which has its own separate scriptures.\n\nThese three perfected beings are the constant deities of the *Dongfang*, while the Nine Perfected are transient manifestations. They separate and reunite the White Prime and the Lordless Lad, coalescing into a single perfected being. Moreover, the White Prime resides in the lungs and does not enter the *Dongfang*. Thus, according to the Jade Scriptures, only the Yellow Elder Lord remains.\n\n*Dengzhen Yinjue*, Scroll the Upper, concludes.\n*(Note: The character 「曰」 above appears to mark a possible lacuna.)*\n*Dengzhen Yinjue*, Scroll the Middle.\n\nLady Yunlin says: Before sleeping at night, first close the eyes tightly and face east. As for the later instruction that one should do this at the time when *qi* is generated, this means that the initial evening rest cannot follow this practice. Only after midnight, upon waking, should one sit up to perform it. Before midday, it may be repeated and recited several times—but one must consider facing east, which does not change with the four seasons.\n\nPress the fleshy part behind the thumbs of both hands against the eyes and wipe toward the ear openings, so that the two palms meet at the nape of the neck, repeating this twenty-seven times. Begin near the back of the palms, starting from the edge of the thumbs, first lightly pressing the eyes (as the scripture says), then wipe each eye left and right, passing over the ear openings and crossing at the back of the neck. Alternate thus, stopping only after twenty-seven repetitions.\n\nVisualize within each eye the emanation of three colored *qi*—purple, azure, and crimson—before you. This is the internal pressing of the Three Primordial Clouds to irrigate and unite the pupils. While pressing, imagine the three colored clouds glowing luxuriantly, each rising above the face. After twenty-seven repetitions, pause briefly, then guide the three *qi* with focused intent, causing their radiance to bathe the eye pupils before repeating the practice.\n\nRecite the following incantation:\n*\"Pupils of triple clouds, true lords of both eyes,\nBrilliant and luminous, they infuse essence and open the pure spirit.\nGrand Mystery’s cloudy forms, numinous and graceful,\nGuard the paired gates and unseal the nine portals.\nAll joints respond in harmony, morning fluids ascend to the Mud Pill,\nThe body ascends to the Jade Palace, ranked among the perfected of the highest order.\"*\n(Comprising six rhyming couplets.)\n\nAfter reciting, swallow saliva fifty times, then open the eyes. This may be practiced upon sitting up and need not be confined to night—though it should be done at the time when *qi* is generated. After a year, the ears and eyes will become sharp and clear. With prolonged practice, one may see a thousand *li* afar, perceive the reflections of spirits, and hear sounds beyond ordinary hearing. This is not merely a method for brightening the eyes and opening the ears but a lofty Dao of true immortals. The immortals of Canglang Fangzhang often treasure and practice it.\n\nThis method originates from the *Scripture of the Four Luminaries of the Supreme* and is transmitted only after swearing an oath with gold and blue-green silk. Among all methods for the ears and eyes, none surpasses this one, hence the establishment of a covenant for its transmission. All practices involving cultivation, visualization, and recitation should likewise be pledged to a profound master—without such an oath, there will be no efficacy. The quantity of gold and silk is left to the practitioner’s discretion.\n\n**Yunlin’s Instruction to Yang Shu**\n\nOn the face, one should often rub both hands until warm, following the contours closely and thoroughly. First, rub the palms together until hot, then use them to wipe the face and eyes. Afterward, smooth the hair as if combing it, and alternately massage the arms with the hands.\n\nThis visualization method may be practiced whenever there is leisure, day or night. First, rub the palms until hot, then wipe the face and eyes several times. Rub the palms together again, then wipe the face once more, repeating this four or five times. Then, pass the hands behind the neck and to the temples, alternately massaging the temples upward as if combing the hair, stopping after several dozen repetitions. Though this is a fine method for restoring youthful complexion and reversing gray hair, the character *er* (而) here is used in its standard sense.\n\nThis method comes from the *Scripture of the Elixir Landscape* and bestows a lustrous complexion, prevents wrinkles and blemishes, keeps hair from turning white, and prevents veins from protruding. After five years of practice, one’s countenance will resemble that of a young maiden—what is called \"the *qi* of mountains and rivers, ever full and never depleted.\" This is the essence of the lower-grade *Dao of the Elixir Landscape*, which states that one should always be as full of *qi* as mountains and rivers, causing even trees and stones to flourish with vitality.\n\n**Recorded by the Prefect**\n\nUpon waking, there is no need to rise early—this may be done at any time after waking from sleep. First, calm the breath and regulate the *qi*, making inhalations and exhalations slow and subtle. Sit upright, facing the direction of the moon’s current palace. Clasp the hands together, then reverse the clasp and extend the arms fully forward. Bring them up to cover the back of the neck, then tilt the head back to look upward, raising the neck and lifting both hands, straining against them three or four times.\n\n*(The character *xing* (兴) means \"to rise\"; here, it refers to clasping the hands to cover the back of the neck, then tilting the head back to raise the neck, exerting force as if struggling, then lowering it gently. Repeat this three or four times, and one may hear the neck bones crack. The character *xing* may also be written as *yu* (与).)*\n\nAfterward, move and bend the body: unclasp the hands, lower the head, bend at the waist, and rotate the back, with the feet possibly lifting and resting. Stretch the hands to the four extremes: raise both hands above the head, then extend them forcefully to the sides, bringing them forward before stretching them fully backward, reversing the stretch. For the reverse stretch and side pulls, first arch the waist backward, then bring the hands together to follow the body, swaying left and right and pulling to the sides. To \"proclaim and shake the hundred joints,\" continue moving vigorously, ensuring that the limbs, feet, hands, arms, and knees all circulate fully. Perform each movement three times, repeating the entire sequence three times—this does not mean completing all movements before starting over.\n\nThis is a matter of oral instruction: the movements of the four limbs cannot all be recorded in writing, so the oral instructions must detail their forms and applications. The intent is simply to follow the annotations provided.\n\n**From the *Essential Scripture of the Great Cavern: Massage Section of the Elixir Landscape***\nThis practice harmonizes essence and blood, prevents the intrusion of wind-*qi*, and if practiced long enough, confers immunity to death and illness. This is an example from the *Great Cavern*—the scroll titles are numerous and not limited to the thirty-nine chapters. Later references to the *Upper Scroll of the Elixir Landscape of the Great Cavern* and the *Great Cavern’s Grand Exorcism Incantation* show that there are many such texts.\n\n**Recorded by the Prefect**\n\nUpon waking, first use a handkerchief or thick cloth to wipe the neck on all sides and behind the ears, ensuring thorough coverage until warm. Then, smooth the hair and massage the neck as if combing it countless times. After a long while, massage both hands and treat the face and eyes. When finished, swallow saliva thirty times to guide the internal fluids.\n\n*(This means that upon first waking, one should face the moon’s palace and perform this method before proceeding to the clasped-hand and reverse-stretch practices.)*\n\n**From the *Upper Chapter of the Essential Scripture of the Elixir Landscape of the Great Cavern***\nWith prolonged practice, this method sharpens the eyes, prevents the intrusion of evil *qi*, and keeps the body free from filth and grime.\n\n**Recorded by the Prefect**\n\nThe character ** is pronounced as *nì*, with the initial of *女* and the final of *忌*.\n\nIf the body feels unwell—meaning one senses discomfort without a specific ailment—press the tongue against the throat, rinse with saliva, and swallow repeatedly. Forcefully curl the tongue upward to block the throat while rinsing and swallowing. Soon, the discomfort will dissipate, and the body will feel relaxed and supple. This method may also be combined with the various massage and visualization practices described herein.\n\n**From the *Upper Scroll of the Scripture of Dissolving and Rubbing the Numinous Sequence***\n\nThe *Dissolving and Rubbing* section, like the chapters of the *Great Cavern*, is by no means insignificant.\n\n**Recorded by the Prefect**\n\nThe four preceding methods do not specify which Perfected One transmitted them.\n\nFrequently press and rub the ears on both sides without count, sharpening one’s hearing. This is called \"tending the city walls\" and is recorded in the *Imperial Register*. An alternate version reads \"tending the city walls,\" with no discrepancy in meaning. Since the ears mark the boundaries of the face, they must be properly tended.\n\nFrequently press the sides of the nose to regulate the breath, ensuring evenness. This is called \"irrigating the Central Peak\" and is recorded in the *Emperor’s Record*. The nose is the mountain peak of the face, the \"Central Peak within the Inner Landscape.\"\n\nDiligently tend to the nose, and regularly remove hairs from the nostrils to keep them clean and unobstructed. Both practices may be performed at leisure: use the hands to press, rub, and tend the ears and nose without count. Thus, the city walls will stand firm, the mountain peaks will tower in splendor, and the *Imperial Register* and *Emperor’s Record* may be inscribed.\n\n**These two methods were transmitted by Lady Li of the Terrace of Illuminating Numinosity, as recorded in the *Upper Scroll of the Scripture of Dissolving and Rubbing***. The character *照* should be *昭*, an error in transcription.\n\n**Recorded by the Prefect**\n\nRegularly cover the mouth with the hand while breathing gently with eyes closed. Over time, saliva will accumulate in the palm; use it to massage and wipe the face. Consistent practice imparts fragrance to the body.\n\nPlace both hands upright over the nose and mouth, allowing breath to pass beneath them. When saliva forms, use it to massage and wipe, then cover again. There is no fixed number of repetitions, but this practice enhances one’s radiance.\n\n**From the *Scripture of the Red Character Stone Landscape***\n\nFrequently press the corners of the eyes and the sides of the nose while holding the breath. When the breath flows smoothly, stop; exhale and begin anew. With persistent practice, the eyes will gain penetrating vision. Use the third finger of each hand to press the inner corners of the eyes beside the nose. There is no fixed number of repetitions; when the breath flows, slightly lift the fingers, then close and press again. This may also be done twenty-seven times.\n\n**From the *Three Scriptures of the Celestial Pass of the Supreme***\n\nThe *Lower Scroll* mentions the *Three Illustrated Scriptures of the Celestial Pass*; the character *图* may be missing.\n\nRegularly lie down with eyes closed, relax the body, and breathe gently to appear as if asleep, so others remain unaware. This may be practiced at any time, day or night, not only when resting. The head should rest evenly on the pillow, aligning the breath and calming the *qi*.\n\nInwardly gaze and listen to the four directions, extending one’s ears and eyes to a hundred thousand *li*. With prolonged practice, one will naturally perceive events at a distance of ten thousand *li*. Focus the mind intently, and the visions will become clear.\n\nBegin by focusing on one direction. For example, direct the ears and eyes eastward to see mountains, rivers, and city walls, and hear mysterious sounds, forming indistinct yet vivid impressions. Feel as though one’s senses extend far into the distance, forgetting the body’s form—this is ideal. One may start with one *li*, then ten, a hundred, or a thousand, gradually expanding the range.\n\nOne may also constantly hear the sounds of gold, jade, silk, and bamboo within the ears. This is a sublime method. Initially, one visualizes hearing them; later, the sounds become real.\n\nThe \"four directions\" are mentioned collectively, but one should begin with a single direction, inwardly directing sight and hearing. At first, there may be no clear impressions, but with time and sincerity, one will naturally attain mastery. All Daoist visualization practices follow this principle. Without accumulating months and years of practice or deep sincerity, one will not perceive the underlying patterns. Do not abandon the practice simply because immediate results are not felt. Those who drill through stone or bow before mountains may be said to possess true resolve.\n\n**From the *Inner Visualization of the Central Directions in the Scripture of Purple Radiance and Blazing Light***\n\nWhen sitting, regularly close the eyes and inwardly visualize the five viscera and intestines. With prolonged practice, their forms and colors will become distinctly clear. During visualization, imagine their shapes, colors, order, relative positions, and sizes as if describing them. The names and sequences of the organs are recorded in the *Twenty-Four Spirits*; they will not be repeated here.\n\n**From the *Scripture of the Three and Five in Harmony with the Purple Writ of the Cinnabar Character***\n\nWhen eating, do not speak of death or expose food, lest various evil *qi* gather. While eating, always face the direction of one’s life destiny and the *wang qi*. All food, whether hot or cold, should be covered. Ghosts and evil spirits delight in approaching to partake of the aroma, turning the remaining flavors turbid and foul, which can also cause illness.\n\nBathe frequently. On *jiazi* days, one should bathe; if not, then on the first day of each month. This practice enhances spiritual clarity. The \"odd months\" refer to the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh months. If a *jiazi* day falls within these months, one may bathe again.\n\nTo dispel corpse *qi*, use the royal days of the four seasons. For immortals’ taboos, use the eleventh day of the eleventh month. The Nine Perfected also use the third day of the third month and the fifth day of the fifth month—all suitable for bathing. Bathing once or twice a month is ideal. The concern is not frequency but the practitioner’s diligence. Washing away the stench of the corpse allows true *qi* to enter.\n\nThe Perfected One of Purple Yang stated: \"Bathe frequently to wash away the *qi* of illness and eliminate the blemishes of accumulated decay. This is also the path to attaining the true.\"\n\nLady of the Purple Tenuity said: \"Infrequent bathing is the nature of the *po*. To oppose the *po* and return to correctness, refine away its turbidity and filth, and the *po* will naturally vanish. Knowing this, one should bathe frequently. This practice is simple, though using warm water in winter may be slightly challenging.\"\n\nWhen bathing, frequently invoke the Six Dings, and all your aspirations will be fulfilled as desired. This means maintaining regular washing day and night, and even during the act of bathing, one may invoke them. The Six Dings are the Six Ding Spirit Maidens, deities readily responsive to human communion and easily summoned. One should also face the direction where the Six Dings reside—during the *jiazi* cycle, this is the *mao* direction. Each of these Jade Maidens has distinct names and attire, as recorded in the *Lingfei*.\n\nWhen combing hair, face the direction of the monthly *wang* (ruling position). This applies to all acts of grooming, washing, or combing the hair. According to the immortals’ taboos, one must never comb hair facing north. In the eleventh month, when *zi* is established, one should still face *hai*; the due north is strictly forbidden. At the very beginning of combing, when the comb first touches the hair, recite the following incantation while combing:\n\n*\"Mud-pellet’s mysterious blossom, preserve essence and endure,\nLeft, the hidden moon; right, the sun’s root.\nThe Six Harmonies refine and purify,\nA hundred spirits receive grace.\"*\n\nAfter reciting, swallow saliva three times.\n\nThe phrase \"left moon, right sun\" signifies the mutual interpenetration of yin and yang, embodying the principle of the Three Hun’s flying essence in purple script. Thus, they are called the \"hidden root.\" *Xuanhua* is the name of the hair spirit, and the *Six Harmonies* refer to the residence beneath the temples. All incantations carry profound meaning, not merely this passage alone.\n\nThe above eight clauses were commanded by the Mystic Master, the Lady of South Marchmount, for implementation. Recorded by the Prefect.\n\nWhen combing hair, face the direction of the *wang* position. At the very start of combing—here, \"start\" replaces \"beginning\"—recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Mud-pellet’s mysterious blossom, preserve essence and endure,\nLeft, the hidden moon; right, the sun’s root.\nThe Six Harmonies refine and purify,\nA hundred spirits receive grace.\"*\n\nAfter reciting, swallow saliva three times.\n\nThe Lady of South Marchmount had already received this method, and now Lady An has also transmitted it. This suggests that though they were unaware of each other’s teachings, the method remains identical. Practicing this regularly will prevent hair loss and promote daily growth. One should frequently change combs, using many teeth without causing pain. The phrase \"frequently comb\" means to alternate the areas being combed. The Lady of Purple Tenuity also advised using combs in rotation, as using a single comb may generate heat, harming the scalp and hair. Thus, one should alternate among four or five combs to keep them cool. Alternatively, one may have an attendant comb the hair thoroughly.\n\nScholars of the Dao do not allow others near their clothing or mats; how much less should they permit others to comb their hair? This should be done personally. Thus, blood and fluids will flow unimpeded, and hair roots will remain firm.\n\nThe above, recorded by the Prefect, is based on the instructions from Jiuhua for implementation, said to originate from the *Tai Ji Lü Jing*.\n\nThe *Zhen Gao* states: When combing or grooming hair, do so frequently to circulate blood and qi, dispersing wind and dampness. Alternate combs in rotation, and there is no need to loosen the hair. The matter of combing hair has been emphasized by the Three Perfected Ones, for it is an urgent practice to be observed. I earnestly urge Immortal Marquis to follow this path to restore black hair.\n\nRecorded by the Prefect, as spoken by the Lady of Purple Tenuity.\n\nIf one treads upon filth or any unclean place, one should bathe to purify the body and dispel it. The method uses ten liang of bamboo leaves—any bamboo leaves may be used, for the essence of those from the northern loom is not distinguished by species. Take four liang of white inner bark from the peach tree (dried may also be used); this refers to the bark of the edible peach, including those growing wild in the mountains, not the mountain peach. Both ingredients are measured by the ancient scale, with dried peach bark halved in quantity. Boil them in one *hu* and two *dou* of clear water in a cauldron, allowing it to come to a single boil—just once, without seeking thickness. Remove and adjust to a suitable temperature to bathe the body, and all impurities will be dissolved. This not only removes filth but also wards off damp impediment, sores, and itching. Moreover, bamboo is hollow and pure within, while peach repels evil and dispels foulness; thus, these two substances are used to purge the body’s turbidity. Bamboo’s nature is hollow and its interior pristine, while peach governs the expulsion of filth—these two *qi* complement each other. As the *Rites* states: When a lord attends a minister’s funeral, the shaman-priest first sweeps away evil with a peach-wood broom. This, too, is to dispel malign *qi*. When celestial beings descend and return, they never fail to cleanse themselves with this water. When perfected ones descend to the world, their forms cannot but be tainted by foul *qi*; thus, peach and bamboo are used in the baths of the palaces on famous mountains. This may sound harsh, but if true, how greatly do immortals differ from mortals? Only in their ability to ascend the void and escape death. As for the talismanic waters and incantations of the mundane world—mere external arts of the outer schools—none compare to this formula. There are old methods for dispelling filth, but beside this, they are like a mound beside Mount Fanghu. If one bathes, it is even better, though this water should not be used for washing the hair. The refined corpse’s pure essence is precisely for bathing—truly a wondrous secret. After bathing, one should wash the hair as usual, not with this water. If, after washing the hair, one rinses it slightly with this water, there is no harm. This water is also called the *Refined Corpse’s Pure Essence*, meant solely for bathing. Dispelling filth is urgent for the student; this secret formula is beyond price.\n\nThe above was commanded for use by Lady Wang of Purple Tenuity, said to originate from the *Tai Shang Jiu Bian Shi Hua Yi Xin Jing*. Recorded by the Prefect.\n\nWhen ingesting immortal medicines, always face the direction of one’s life destiny. After ingestion, do not speak of death, mourning, or inauspicious matters, lest one harm the spirit and waste the medicine’s benefit. All immortal elixirs and worldly formulas should be taken thus, except for the *Initial Spirit Pill* and *Golden Elixir*, which are taken facing east.\n\nThe above was told to Master Yang by the Eastern Minister. Recorded by the Prefect in two versions.\n\nMaster said: At midnight, remove the pillow and lie flat, clench the fists, relax the body, and regulate the breath until it is subtle—then the body’s spirits are complete. If any are lacking, rise quickly, burn incense, sit upright with eyes closed, clench the fists over the knees, and visualize the body’s spirits. Envision a white *qi* the size of a chicken’s egg before the eyes, and the spirits will be restored. Practice this once every five days. This method follows the visualization of the twenty-four spirits, though here it speaks only of visualizing the spirits without mentioning their origin—likely a summary of that practice. The white *qi* in the eyes pertains to the *Way of the Bright Mirror*, but practicing it every five days is merely the mirror’s work, not the full restoration of the spirits. Perhaps it may be integrated for use, but if one is cultivating the great scriptures, this may be omitted.\n\nMaster said: The method of *shi gui* sharpens the eyes and, with time, grants penetrating vision. The twenty-four spirits are called the *Way of the Wiping Youth*, enabling one to clearly see the twenty-four spirits. On the *gengwu* day within the *jiazi* ten-day period, at noon, take clear east-flowing water and mix it with true cinnabar. Use one *dou* of water and two *zhu* of true pearl, stirring twenty-one times toward the moon’s position. Wash the eyes with this, facing east at dawn, twenty-one times. The scripture says: Always face east and wash the eyes twenty-one times. Regular practice is excellent. This is but a rough summary of the scriptural method; if one has already practiced the original method, this is no longer needed. Most scriptural formulas and techniques prove ineffective, as is often the case. Such brevity—how could it compare to the original scripture? If one has not seen the original method, this may be employed. Thus, those who toil in vain into old age do so because of such incomplete teachings.\n\nMaster said: To cultivate the Way, visualize the sun and moon in the eyes, always seeing their forms. Also visualize the left eye as the sun and the right as the moon. Listen for the master’s voice in the ears, always hearing the master’s sound, including speech and breath, taking them as models. The mouth constantly exhales the dead and inhales the living *qi*, adjusting to the four seasons’ waxing and waning. For example, in spring, exhale yellow and inhale green. Embody the five stars, as in Master Pei’s visualization, with the five stars positioned to the left, right, front, back, and above the head. Walk as if treading empty space, moving as though in the void, not as if pacing the Dipper or riding the net. The mind constantly contemplates long life; in sitting, lying, walking, and coming, always think of immortality. Be cautious in laughter and measured in speech—why speak much when unnecessary? Constantly reflect on one’s form, always recognizing one’s own appearance and complexion. These are essential practices. Though these methods lack formal techniques for cultivation, they are the wellsprings of learning.\n\nThe above two passages are said to be Master Pei’s words. Recorded by the Prefect and his assistant in two versions.\n\nFrom the beginning to this point, there are thirty-seven matters concerning court rituals, nurturing life, and daily practices. Whenever traversing dangerous paths, passing through ghostly temples, or encountering places of doubt or subtle taboo, one should first curl the tongue inward to press against the throat. Only after reciting the incantation should the tongue be extended.\n\nSwallow the saliva three times, then with the second and third fingers of the left hand, pinch the base of the philtrum beneath the nostrils—where the inner edge of the nasal septum lies—thirty-six times. Press firmly without lifting the fingers to count. This firm pressing is done while silently counting, with each breath marking one cycle.\n\nThe region between the nasal septum and the nostrils is called the *Mountain Source*, also known as the *Ghost Well*, the *Divine Pool*, the *Root of Evil*, or the *Terrace of the Hun*. As these five names appear in the later incantation, they are first clarified here. The Lady of Purple Tenuity states: \"The *Mountain Source* lies at the base of the philtrum beneath the nose, slightly recessed within the valley.\" If needled with a pin, it can also treat sudden death.\n\nAfter pinching, knock the teeth seven times. Then advance the palm to cover the nose, and without removing the hand, knock the teeth again. Once done, further advance the palm to cover both nose and mouth, with the fingertips reaching the hairline, bowing to cover the *Bright Hall*. At this moment, close the eyes and inwardly visualize the Three Lords of the *Bright Hall*, casting forth the radiant red light of the bell-mirror. Also visualize the Infant Lord of the *Mud-Pill Palace*, reciting the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern* to exert awe and command.\n\nThen softly intone the incantation:\n*\"Crimson Crow soars heavenward, divine might unfurls within.\nThe Four Pillars of Mountain Source, the Ghost Well flees in flight.\nThe Divine Pool exhales its breath, the Root of Evil cowers low.\nThe Terrace of the Hun shines forth, the Jade Chamber rings with light.\nThe Jade Perfected stands sublime, enthroned within the Bright Hall,\nWielding purple mist in hand, crowned with the dawn’s first glow.\nReciting the Cavern Scripture, its thirty-nine chapters hold\nDragons and tigers that repel evil, cleaving peaks and rending hills,\nFierce beasts and charging oxen, blades devoured and spears consumed,\nUplifting mountains, tolling heaven, poisonous dragons and divine birds,\nSix-headed beasts that breathe forth fire, devourers of demon kings,\nLightning-walled and thunder-sired, restraining stars in wild array,\nOwls and blazing creatures, traversing winds in bold defiance,\nCelestial beasts in ordered ranks, all stand beside me now,\nSpewing flames a thousand yards to banish every ill.\nA host of spirits clear the path, sealing off mountain realms,\nA thousand gods and hundred spirits bow their heads in reverence,\nMarshals bearing censers burn incense on my behalf.\nWherever I tread, wherever I pass, ten thousand spirits come to greet.\"*\n\nWhen finished, knock the teeth three more times, then open the eyes and remove the left hand. Thus, the numinous root is stirred, celestial huntsmen arrive to guard, a thousand spirits tremble and submit, none daring to disturb my qi.\n\nThese names within the incantation are all titles of divine beasts and spirit officers, hence their power to repel malevolent forces.\n\nThe above is drawn from the *Highest Inner Chapters of the True Scripture of the Great Cavern*, the supreme method of the *Great Incantation for Suppressing Evil*. Recorded by the Prefect.\n\nThe method of the *Northern Emperor for Slaying Ghosts* begins by knocking the teeth thirty-six times, then reciting the incantation:\n*\"Heavenly Peng, Heavenly Peng,\nNine Primes slay the youth,\nFive Ding Commanders,\nLofty Blade of the Northern Duke,\nSeven Governors, Eight Spirits,\nSupreme One subdues the fierce,\nLong-skulled giant beast,\nGrasping the Emperor’s Bell,\nThree White Owls, divine spirits,\nDriving the leviathan’s chariot,\nMighty Sword Spirit King,\nSevering evil, erasing traces,\nPurple qi ascends heaven,\nCrimson radiance blazes forth,\nDevouring demons, consuming ghosts,\nBody transverse, drinking wind,\nAzure tongue, green teeth,\nFour-eyed ancient elder,\nHeavenly Ding warriors,\nAwe to the south, repelling evil,\nCelestial couriers, fierce and swift,\nAwe to the north, bearing blades,\nThree hundred thousand soldiers,\nGuard my ninefold layers,\nExpelling corpses a thousand miles,\nDispelling all misfortune.\nDare any petty ghost\nApproach to witness this?\nChains of heaven, mighty axes,\nSevering the five forms of ghosts,\nFlame Emperor rends their flesh,\nNorthern Dipper burns their bones,\nFour Luminaries shatter their frames,\nHeavenly Strategy annihilates their kind.\nOne stroke of the divine blade—\nTen thousand ghosts scatter in rout.\"*\n\nEach four-character line is punctuated by a single tap of the teeth. For all thirty-six lines, there are thirty-six taps.\n\nIf one recites this incantation by day or night, it becomes a perpetual invocation. There is no fixed time for its practice; whenever one has leisure or at the junctures of dawn and dusk, in any place of doubt or darkness, one may recite it—whispering the words.\n\nWhen ghosts hear this incantation thrice, their eyes rot and blind, and their bodies perish at once. This refers to all slaying ghosts and malevolent spirits, as well as the inherently wicked and powerful ghosts that roam between heaven and earth. Upon hearing this, they die—not the lingering souls of the dead who become ghosts. Such ghosts do possess eyes, and thus their blindness and decay bring immediate death.\n\nThis divine incantation bears the authority of the Office of Ghost-Slaying. Within its words lie the titles of the officials of Fengdu and the names of the gods, so that ghosts hear it and die in terror. The \"thousand warriors led by Xu, wielding the might of the southern forces\" are those who repel evil. The Flame Emperor is the Emperor of Hai, and the Four Luminaries are the Lords of the Four Directions. The Northern Emperor guards this Way in secrecy, for he commands the spirits and men who dispel ghosts. If one encounters this incantation, the ghosts can no longer prevail, hence its secrecy.\n\nShould one in this world obtain and practice this incantation, it becomes the Way to avoid death. All human death is caused by the slaying of ghosts and spirits; once they can no longer claim a life, one ceases to die. Men and women, young and old, may all practice it—only hindered by ignorance of the spell. Those who know it must use it in secret, for its power knows no bounds of age or stature.\n\nThese words seem intended for the household of a chief administrator. When afflicted by illness, reciting this brings instant recovery. If ghosts flee, how can sickness remain? When tapping the teeth, one should close the eyes and visualize the five viscera, each inhabited by its respective spirit—this arises naturally.\n\nAt the first tap of the teeth, twenty-six times, one should close the eyes and inwardly behold the five viscera in sequence, imagining each clearly. The spirits of the five viscera reside within; only then can one align with the true and subdue the perverse, commanding the spirits and executing ghosts.\n\nThe secrets of this incantation are held within Fengdu. Now they are discreetly shared—let them not be revealed to the unworthy, but guarded by those of the Dao. Though this is not the highest scripture of the perfected, it is the supreme art of vanquishing ghosts. With evil dispelled, the true qi may be harnessed, and the slaying of malevolence tested—an essential method for the seeker.\n\nYet many dismiss it as too simple or minor, allowing it to be passed down carelessly. Thus, the divine incantation’s efficacy remains hidden, its power unexercised—a grave error.\n\n*—Copied from the two manuscripts of Master Yang and Chancellor Yuan.*\n\nMount Fengdu lies in the north, in the Gui region. Above and below it are palaces of ghosts and spirits. On the mountain stand six palaces, and within its caverns lie six more, identical in name and form.\n\nThe first palace is called the Palace of Zhou, Severer of the Yin Heaven. Proceeding eastward, the second is the Palace of Tai Sha, the Solemn and Just Ancestor of Heaven. The third is the Palace of Ming Chen, the Enduring and Defiant Warrior City of Heaven. The fourth is the Palace of Tian Zhao, the Serene Illuminator of Sinful Qi. The fifth is the Palace of Zong Ling, the Sevenfold Nonconformity of Heaven. The sixth is the Palace of Gan Si, the Daring Controller of the Winding and Repeated Heaven.\n\nThese six palaces share the same names within and without. The first lies farthest west, with the rest arrayed eastward, all facing south. Each palace spans a thousand li, serving as the abode of all ghosts and spirits. Should one know the names of the six heavenly palace gates of Fengdu, no ghost will dare to harm them.\n\nEarlier, it was said that \"stone\" refers to the palace names, while here and in the incantation, they are called gate names. The gates take their names from the palaces, hence the shared designation. When ghosts hear one recite these names, they recognize the speaker as a master of the heavenly palaces and dare not offend.\n\nBefore lying down, one should face north and recite the invocation thrice, softly. One may also slightly incline toward the Gui direction, reciting the full text once. Upon completion, tap the teeth six times, then recite it again—three times in total.\n\nThe incantation reads:\n*\"I am a disciple of the Most High, governing the Six Heavens below. The palaces of the Six Heavens are my domain—not only my domain, but the dominion of the Most High. I know the names of the Six Heavens’ palaces, and thus I attain long life. Should any dare to offend, the Most High shall sever your form. The first palace is named the Palace of Zhou, Severer of the Yin Heaven. Proceeding eastward, the second palace is named...\"*\n\nEach recitation consists of one hundred nineteen characters. Proceed in order until all six palaces are named. Then tap the teeth six times before lying down. After three recitations, one may attend to other matters—this practice alone suffices to repel all ghostly and malevolent qi.\n\nAt dusk, first recite the *Stone Stalagmite Text*, then read the *Ode to the Fengdu Palaces of the Pillars of Liang City*:\n*\"Zhou severs the dawn’s rule,\nSolemn affairs weave the layered peaks.\nFlaming as mist in the skies,\nBursting like radiant blossoms.\nWu Yang bears the divine blade,\nTian Zhao devours the clear river.\nThe Gate of Heaven overlooks the cinnabar well,\nCloud Gates rise in towering majesty.\nThe Sevenfold Nonconformity spreads its wondrous canopy,\nThe Winding and Repeated unfurl their demonic might.\nThe Six Heavens bar the northern path—\nThis is the abode of ghosts and spirits.\"*\n\nThe ode spans twenty thousand words; here, only the names of the Six Heavenly Palaces are excerpted. One may softly recite it at night—it, too, repels ghosts. Since it contains the names of the palace gates, ghosts fear it.\n\nIn the earlier text, the third palace is named *Wu Cheng* (Warrior City), while the ode calls it *Wu Yang* (Warrior Sun). This may indicate dual names or separate meanings—it is likely not an error.\n\n*—Two passages from Master Zhong’s teachings. Copied from the two manuscripts of Master Yang and Chancellor Yuan.*\n\nWhen traveling at night, one should always click the teeth—there is no fixed number of clicks. The sound of clicking teeth terrifies both *sha-ghosts* and *xie-ghosts*, ensuring they do not harm one. The *sha-ghosts* are those dispatched by the Supreme of Fengdu to claim lives, while the *xie-ghosts* are malevolent spirits and *wangliang* that lurk between heaven and earth to harm people. If one combines this with rinsing the mouth and reciting incantations, the effect is even better.\n\nThe *Immortal Methods* states: \"Regularly swallowing saliva and clicking the teeth can make one revert to youth. Clicking the teeth prevents external ghosts from invading while keeping the inner spirits ever vigilant; swallowing saliva ensures harmonious qi is always abundant, nourishing the flesh and marrow, thus warding off illness and aging.\"\n\n*—From Master Zhong’s teachings. Copied from the two manuscripts of Master Yang and Chancellor Yuan.*\n\nIn the mortal realm, there are fierce and malevolent ghosts of the lower earth who often appear as women to deceive and test people. These cunning ghosts and old spirits are adept at such transformations—not only as women but also taking forms based on one’s desires, leading those who follow them into confusion and delusion. Beginners whose minds are not yet steadfast and pure, harboring impure thoughts, often attract such encounters and must repel them.\n\nIf this occurs, hold your breath and visualize the *Central Balance* star within the *Celestial Pass*, the image of the *Big Dipper*, with the *Xuanji*, *Heng*, *Fu*, and *Bi* stars all guarding the *cun* position, its handle pointing forward to encompass the body’s spirits. Focus on the *cun*, the *Hall of Light’s* three palaces, and the twenty-four spirits within the five viscera. Compose your expression, steady your will, and gaze intently at the pupil of their eye. If the pupil is murky and unclear, it is a ghostly test.\n\nOne should then draw near with caution and observe their eyes—if the pupils appear dim, know they are not immortals but *xie-ghosts*. Alternatively, one may test them with a bright mirror. Upon recognizing a ghostly test, visualize the Seven Stars before your face or above your head to dispel it. One may also imagine the Seven Stars emerging from the *cun* to cover the head, the handle pointing forward, and strike them. Alternatively, silently recite incantations such as *Tianmu* or *Tianpeng*.\n\nIf the pupil is square and bright, they are a true immortal. Even if not perfectly square, if the eyes are clear and bright, they may still be a person of the *Xun* path. When illuminated by fire or sunlight, they cast no shadow—this further confirms their authenticity. Those who perceive this should bow in reverence; those who fail to recognize it have not passed the test. To mistake a *xie-ghost* for a true immortal is also a failure of discernment—take heed.\n\nThese two matters are the most difficult to distinguish. I have discussed them in exhaustive detail in the *Precepts and Admonitions* of my second volume.\n\n*—From Master Pei’s teachings. Copied from the two manuscripts of the Chief Clerk and Chancellor.*\n\nThe preceding six matters all concern methods to expel demonic spirits and guard against ghostly trials. The *Mingtang Inner Scripture*’s *Heart-Opening Talisman to Dispel Delusion* was compiled and employed by Lord Wang. The talisman appears in the sixth volume’s *Talisman and Diagram Manual*; this is the method of the one-inch *Mingtang* within the heart. There should also be a separate major scripture, but here I excerpt only the matter of dispelling delusion.\n\nLord Wang is the Supreme Minister of the Assembly of Perfected. On the *kai*-day at dawn, face the direction of Wang, write in cinnabar, bow twice, and ingest it. At dawn, following the monthly branch, write in cinnabar on white paper, then hold it in the left hand, bow, recite the incantation, and ingest it. The incantation reads:\n\n*\"Five spirits open the heart,\npiercing hearing, cutting off sound.\nThree hun souls gather essence,\nall guard the cinnabar heart.\nLet me not be deluded;\nfive viscera seek afar.\"*\n\nAfter bowing and reciting, ingest the talisman, then swallow saliva five times and click the teeth five times. Do not let others see. If the *kai*-day is not used, take it on the first, fifteenth, and twenty-seventh days of the month—three times a month. In one year, the secret talisman will prove efficacious. Those who do not know the *kai*-day may use these two days; now one may also take it five or six times a month.\n\n*—From the two manuscripts of the Chief Clerk and Chancellor.*\n\nThe Eastern Flower Perfected’s method of ingesting the images of the sun and moon is a superior practice. In the Eastern Flower Palace, both men and women who attain perfection still employ it. Thus, the method of solar radiance remains preserved by the Azure Lord. Men ingest the solar image; women ingest the lunar image. Do not neglect this daily, for it sharpens clarity, illuminates the five viscera, refines the hun and po souls, harmonizes the six bowels, and is the Way of long life and deathlessness.\n\nAt dawn, face east, write the solar image in cinnabar on blue paper, hold it in the left hand, visualize it as a sun the size of a pellet, crimson with purple radiance, then ingest it, swallowing it into the heart so its light shines through. Afterward, click the teeth nine times and swallow saliva nine times. Women ingest the lunar image, writing in yellow on blue paper, holding it in the right hand, also facing east to ingest and visualize it entering the heart.\n\n*Huimeng* (回月)—these two characters are copied from the original in cinnabar.\n\n*—Method for writing the solar and lunar images. The sun may also be written as a circle. Now that both square and circular forms exist, along with the unaltered character for \"sun,\" one should follow this. In the *Purple Text of the Great Mystery Talisman*, the character for \"sun\" is written as a circle. Since it is called the \"image of the sun and moon,\" it should resemble the characters for sun and moon. Moreover, ancient scripts occasionally depict the character for \"moon\" in its shape, hence the *Eight Styles of Calligraphy* term it \"pictographic.\" If one ingests the circular form, the character should likewise be written thus. All have established methods in the *Talisman and Diagram Manual.*\n\n*—From Lord Yang’s manuscript.*\n\nThe Supreme Void Perfected, the Crimson Lord of Southern Marchmount, taught this inner method: On the fifth night of the month at midnight, visualize the solar image within the heart, as if the sun enters through the mouth, illuminating the heart’s interior to merge with the sun’s light. Whether sitting or lying down, first visualize the sun as crimson with nine rays of purple radiance, suddenly entering the mouth and settling in the heart, its inner and outer light merging as one. Afterward, one should feel the heart warm, suffused with rosy glow. Initially, merely visualize to warm the heart; over time, one will truly feel its heat. Focus the mind’s essence, and the effect will come easily.\n\nAfter a long while, recite the incantation:\n*\"Great brightness nurtures essence,\ninternally refining the cinnabar heart.\nLight and radiance merge,\ndivine perfected ones come seeking.\"*\n\nThen swallow saliva nine times. On the fifteenth, twenty-fifth, and twenty-ninth days, repeat the above method. These three days are all auspicious, being conjunctions of solar and lunar cycles. Later texts state that one should practice frequently, not strictly on these days—indeed, one may perform this every midnight. It sharpens perception, unblocks all passages, bestows a jade-like glow to the face and a golden luster to the body. Practicing for fifteen years, the Great One will dispatch a *baoche* to welcome you, ascending to the Great Empyrean.\n\nAnother authentic manuscript states: After five years of practice, the Great One will send the Jade Guardian Duke to descend and welcome you—this likely refers to the *tuoche* (chariot). Here it simply says *baoche*, which is still the carriage of the Jade Guardian Duke. Practice frequently, not only on these days.\n\n*—This passage is excerpted from the *Scripture of the Supreme High on Dispelling and Polishing.*\"*\n\nThis version originates from the *Scripture of Wisdom and Dispelling* and was excerpted and employed by Lord Chi, hence it is termed an \"inner method.\" The Prefect copied two versions.\n\nThe Eastern Flower Palace possesses the method of ingesting the radiance of the sun and moon, which even perfected immortals continue to practice. It involves simply visualizing a sun within the heart, the size of a coin, crimson in color. As for the term \"simply visualize,\" its origin is now unknown—it does not enter through the mouth but is perceived solely within the heart as a solar form. Though no larger than a coin, it is not flat but spherical, like a pellet, nine *fen* in diameter, of a pure crimson hue. One further visualizes the sun as having nine rays, which are also said to be crimson, though not explicitly called \"rays.\" According to later passages, the moon’s rays are white, so the sun’s rays should be violet. From the heart, it ascends through the throat to the teeth, where one visualizes nine violet rays, all rising into the mouth with their tips pointing toward the teeth but not emerging. At this time, the mouth is closed and the teeth are clenched; only the rays emerge, not the solar form itself—this is what is meant by \"ingesting the sun’s rays.\" The rays then return to the stomach. While the rays ascend, the sun remains visualized above the heart, its radiant tips extending to the roots of the teeth, lingering within the throat and chest, illuminating the mouth and teeth. After a long while, the ray-tips curl backward, descending from the throat into the stomach. The distance from the stomach to the heart is equal to that from the throat to the heart, and the rays neither extend nor retract. After some time, with eyes closed, one clearly perceives within the heart and stomach: the sun remains in the heart while the rays reside in the stomach, causing light to flow and suffuse the organs, making the abdomen slightly warm. One then exhales, rinses the mouth with saliva, and swallows the fluid thirty-nine times before stopping. The exhalation refers to the initial visualization, where the mouth and teeth are closed and breath is held. Only after completing the visualization does one release the breath, open the teeth, rinse the mouth with saliva, and swallow it, visualizing the fluid as violet. This is performed three times daily: at dawn facing east, at noon facing south, and at dusk facing west, each time sitting upright, closing the eyes, holding the breath, and visualizing. Practicing this for one year dispels illness; for five years, the body gains a radiant luster; for eighteen years, one attains the Dao, casts no shadow at noon, and repels all malevolent spirits, evil influences, and calamitous qi. If one ingests the forms of the sun and moon directly, the time required is less than eighteen years; since this method involves only the rays, it is slightly slower.\n\nThe sun and moon constantly reside within the body, merging with one’s form to illuminate it, hence the absence of shadow. With all spirits radiant and clear, how could evil dare to approach? One should constantly visualize the sun in the heart and the moon in the *niwan* (Mud-Pill Palace). The phrase \"constantly visualize\" clarifies that this is not limited to the time of ingestion, as the sun and moon do not leave the mouth. At night, one ingests the moon’s essence in the same manner as the sun, visualizing both without needing to see their true forms—simply remain indoors. Since the moon is used at night, one may also practice while lying down, performing it three times during the hours of *wu*, *zi*, and *chou*. The earlier reference to the moon residing in the *niwan* refers to the *niwan* Palace of the Upper Cinnabar Field; the Mysterious Cinnabar is also called *niwan*. Elsewhere, the *Xuan Zhen* method visualizes the moon in the Hall of Brightness, but these are separate practices. Here, since the sun resides in the heart, the seat of the perfected, the moon should correspondingly dwell in the Chamber of the Red Child, aligning with the principle—hence it is placed in the Upper Cinnabar Field.\n\nOne visualizes the moon’s ten rays as white. Though the moon’s color is yellow, these rays are white, precisely the ten rays of the Daoist moon, which are white. This further clarifies that the moon’s form does not descend through the mouth. The visualized moon is one *cun* in diameter. From the brain, it descends into the throat. The Nine Palaces all reside within the brain, so since the moon is in the *niwan*, it may be called the brain. Moreover, this emphasizes that it does not exit externally but descends inward. Among the Nine Palaces, only the *niwan* Palace has an aperture connecting to the throat. One visualizes the ten rays descending directly from the *niwan* through the nasal passages, with five rays emerging from each nostril into the throat, their tips also pointing toward the teeth. The rays do not emerge from the teeth but return to the stomach. At this time, the mouth and teeth are closed as before, and the rays are held within the mouth, filling it with light. They then turn backward and descend into the stomach. One exhales, rinses with white fluid, and swallows thirty-nine times. Upon completion, the rays connected to the brain abruptly vanish.\n\nThe above was transmitted by the Lady of the Southern Culmen, who stated that this method is practiced by all perfected immortals and derives from the upper and middle chapters of the *Great Scripture of Wisdom*. Those who practice it diligently will witness the Great Peace. Lord Wang of the Western City said: \"Practicing this method of the sun in the heart and the moon in the *niwan* is simple and easy to grasp, with no risk of abandonment midway. It requires no incantations or invocations, nor does one need to see the sun and moon—the visualization is not difficult, and it does not burden one with excessive methods while in the mortal realm. It is the way to eliminate the Three Corpses, the hundred illnesses, and the thousand evils, and to refine the hun and po souls. When the sun and moon constantly illuminate the body, ghosts have no place to hide; when one’s form is perpetually inhabited by the sun and moon, evil spirits cannot lurk—hence one remains free from illness. The Azure Lord now practices this, and I am that very person.\"\n\nThis matter from the *Scripture of Wisdom* is not limited to this single method; even the *Zong Zhen* also employs it. Practicing this method does not hinder the ingestion of the sun and moon as described in the *Precious Scriptures*; indeed, combining them is even better. The \"sun and moon of the Precious Scriptures\" refers to the *Five Elders’ Precious Canon*, specifically the method of the Three Hun in the *Purple Texts*. Since this method differs in its internal and external aspects, it may be practiced concurrently. At dawn and dusk, one should first visualize and ingest the rays indoors, then, when the sun and moon appear, proceed with the method of the radiant mist.\n\nI now reveal this to you—this is addressed to Lord Yang. It may be discreetly shared with those of sincere intent. Instruct the Prefect’s aide accordingly. An immortal performs a thousand tasks in a single day and night without feeling weary, demonstrating the utmost diligence in the Dao—such an opportunity in life must not be squandered. Once one is called an immortal, the body naturally endures labor; this refers to those destined for immortality.\n\nFor beginners whose resolve is not yet firm, their constitution naturally inclines toward weariness. With prolonged practice, however, one may attain ease and proficiency. One must not exert excessive effort at first only to grow lax later. Proceed gradually from small beginnings, ensuring each method is practiced with constancy. One should not hastily covet quantity or aspire to lofty heights.\n\nIn cultivating the Dao, the concern is not with multiplicity but with maintaining proper sequence to avoid disorder and confusion. As the saying goes: \"Without the obscurity of coherence, one practices the coherence of obscurity without order.\"\n\nEons of karmic affinity have brought forth this present life. To lose this life is to await another ten thousand eons—how can one not be fiercely diligent, striving to attain eternal life herein?\n\n---\n\n**Lord Yang’s Letter**\n\nSupervisor Fan of Tongchu states the method of ingesting the Three Qi: Visualize a blue qi, a white qi, and a red qi, each like a thread descending from the rising sun in the east and entering the mouth. At dawn, face the sun; if overcast or rainy, visualize facing it. Whether seated or standing, with eyes closed, envision these three colored qi aligned—blue on the left, then the others—appearing like suspended rays converging into the mouth, their roots still tethered to the sun. Draw them in ninety times, ceasing once satiated. One inhalation and one swallow count as one cycle. As the qi enters the throat, guide it to flow into the organs and viscera. When the count nears completion, gradually cease until the qi is fully absorbed.\n\nAfter ten years of practice, the Three Qi will naturally reside within the body, manifesting as three-colored qi emanating from the crown of the head. This is the *High Prime Lord’s Method of the Inner Radiance of Grand Simplicity*, a minor practice of the *Supreme Clarity Lords of the Three Primes*.\n\nPerform this daily with eyes closed, facing the sun for optimal results. Though the method is subtle, its effects are verified. Lord Xu may practice it.\n\nThis is a method of *Grand Simplicity*; if the Immortal Marquis also practices it, it is by no means inferior. However, Supervisor Fan’s attainment is limited to supervision, for among the many Daoist practices he has cultivated, he has mastered but this one. Now instructing Lord Xu to employ this method serves as mutual support, not as a fixed primary practice.\n\n---\n\n**Middle Lord’s Discourse**\n**Lord Yang’s Letter**\n\n**Method of Ingesting Mist, Conferred by the Perfected Lady Zhang Weizi of the Chamber of Embracing the Real upon the Jade Consort of the Eastern Flower**\n\nAt dawn’s first light, within the stillness of your chamber—where you lie abed—sit or recline as you prefer. First, close your eyes and turn your gaze inward, faintly perceiving the five viscera. Visualize their forms and colors distinctly, each in proper order. When this is complete, exhale through the mouth twenty-four times, performing this with eyes still closed. With each exhalation, expel the five-colored qi of the five viscera, so that all five qi emerge simultaneously—twenty-four cycles in all. As you exhale, maintain the inward vision of the five viscera until all are fully perceived. Then, slightly parting your eyes, continue exhaling until you see the five-colored qi intertwining before your face, swirling thickly above it.\n\nThough the text earlier speaks of exhaling qi, here it specifies five colors. These do not come from without but are the very five-colored qi of the five viscera, now tangled and interwoven, crowning your head and face. Next, draw this five-colored qi into your mouth and swallow it fifty times. As the five hues congeal and linger above your face, wait a while, then inhale them together, guiding them into your mouth to be swallowed. You will feel the five-colored qi of Heaven and Earth merging with that upon your face, both returning to their respective viscera. Each of the five qi, upon exiting and reentering, follows its own color back to its source. Perform ten swallows in sequence, beginning with the lungs, then heart, liver, kidneys, and spleen.\n\nAfterward, swallow saliva sixty times—this refers to the act of swallowing emptily. Then recite the subtle invocation:\n\n*\"Radiant dawn-glow arises,\nSpirit-mist drifts on all sides.\nCoiling qi bends and twists,\nFive colors fill the cavern-heaven.\nDivine smoke unfurls,\nGold and stone bloom with true essence.\nPurple emptiness gathers in mist,\nRefining form to preserve wholeness.\nEmerging light conceals the hidden,\nFive numina transform and divide.\nConjoined brightness fans the void,\nRiding the six clouds in due season.\nGuard and embrace this body of mine,\nAscending to the Nine Heavens.\"*\n\nWhen finished, strike the teeth together seven times, swallow saliva seven times, then open your eyes. The ritual is complete.\n\nThe preceding text describes the *Method of Ingesting Mist*, and its preface states: *\"Mist is the essence-flower of mountains, marshes, water, and fire, the overflowing qi of metal and stone.\"* Yet here, what is visualized and ingested is the qi of one’s own five viscera. Why? Because the twenty-four exhalations earlier intermingle with the external mist, merging the two smokes into one body. Thus, when you swallow fifty times in rapid succession, you are in truth ingesting mist-qi twenty-six times over.\n\nThis Way is wondrous and numinous. Many in the Mystic Capital of the Divine Continent have attained this art. Might you, too, practice it? This is also addressed to Lord Yang. With long and steadfast practice, you will come to ride clouds and mist in your travels. It is further said: *\"With prolonged ingestion, one may disperse the form into emptiness, merging body with cloud and qi.\"*\n\n**Middle Lord’s Discourse.**\n**Lord Yang’s Letter.**\n\nDu Guangping’s received technique of *Jieying Xuanbai* is also called the *Tai Jing Zhong Jing Xuanbai Inner Method*. At all times, whether sitting or lying down, visualize as you will: within the *Niwan* there is black qi, within the heart there is white qi, and within the navel there is yellow qi. These three places are also called the Three Palaces, and they are another branch of the Three Ones, differing only in the colors of their qi. The three qi arise together like clouds to cover the body, each emerging from its original place as small as a bean, then gradually growing to envelop the crown and the entire body. They then transform into fire, which coils around the body. Though internally it has become fire, externally the three qi remain. The body becomes pervasively luminous, inner and outer as one. The fire and qi together refine the body, illuminating it inside and out. Practice this from dawn until midday, then cease.\n\nAmong all cultivation methods, this one endures the longest. In visualizing qi and fire, proceed with calm and composure, allowing gradual transformation. After refining the body, persist even longer, as if in slumber, until you no longer sense the four limbs—this is best. Then ingest qi one hundred and twenty times in total, completing the practice. Also visualize and ingest the three colored qi from before, forty times each.\n\nThis is the true Way, enabling one to attain longevity and immortality, warding off all harm. As it is said: *\"Know the white, guard the black—death cannot come; know the black, guard the white—all evil dissipates.\"* The white and black refer to the three colored qi mentioned earlier, the so-called *Xuanbai*. This saying is also drawn from the *Five Thousand Characters*.\n\nStrictly avoid the flesh of the six livestock and the flavors of the five pungents. Sleep apart in quietude to focus the mind, and above all, shun the bedchamber—for the bedchamber brings death. This method resembles *Shouyi* but is more direct and essential, thus simplified. It is abbreviated for efficiency. The prohibition against the bedchamber is even stricter than in *Shouyi*, where restraint is the key. *Shouyi* permits having children, so it does not require complete abstinence.\n\nAt first, visualize the qi emerging like small beans, gradually growing to pierce the heavens. The three qi coil around the throat and entwine the body, merging into one. Suddenly, fire arises within the three smokes, uniting with the inner radiance to refine the entire body. Within, the five viscera become luminous—this is the essential Way.\n\nThe previous method was slightly abridged, so it is restated here. Visualization must be thus. This is the study of deathlessness, though it does not yet reach the Dao of immortality. It may be practiced alongside other methods to dispel all evil, repel a thousand harms, and after thirty years of cultivation, conceal the form and hide the body, traveling five hundred *li* in a day.\n\nThis Way is rather humble. If pursued to its utmost, other practices cannot be undertaken simultaneously. Those of shallow capacity and limited destiny should adhere to this. It is not the pursuit of advanced scholars. If one wishes to guard *Xuanbai*, one should receive its scripture, which is brief. This *Xuanbai* has its own proper canon and should also have its invocations. What is recorded here is but an excerpt, much like the matters of *Xuan Zhen*. This method remains an old technique of the *Taiqing* tradition.\n\n**Preserver of Life’s Discourse.**\n**Attendant’s Letter.**\n\nThe Master says: If one wishes to attain longevity, one must wash the face and purify the heart. When the sun has risen two *zhang*, and only after it has fully ascended, may this be practiced. Face the sun, exhale the dead qi from the mouth, and inhale the sun’s essence through the nose. When a sneeze is induced, cease—this is called the passage of qi. The mouth should always exhale the dead, turbid qi of the four seasons, while the nose draws in the essence of cinnabar clouds, stopping only when a sneeze naturally occurs. This method closely resembles the preceding one, though it lacks invocations. It is a means to replenish essence, restore the embryo, and attain longevity.\n\nThe Master says: To rectify the heart, one should begin when the sun has risen three *zhang*. After inducing the sneeze, repeat the practice. Cross the hands upon the shoulders, with the left hand above—this must not be mistaken. Let the sun align with the heart, so that the heart is centered directly toward the sun, and the sun, in turn, is envisioned as directly facing the heart. When warmth is felt within the heart, the heart is rectified. This warmth arises from the sun’s radiant essence entering the heart. It is excellent to practice this regularly. Some say that when the heart is not rectified, it is swiftly swayed by wayward affairs. Thus, the Perfected One instructs one to face the sun and observe it. Upon perceiving any deviation, this method is taught. In essence, it aligns with the principle of sunlight entering the heart. Now, regardless of whether the heart is rectified or not, practicing this consistently is itself an excellent technique.\n\n**Two entries transmitted by Master Pei.**\n**Recorded in the manuscripts of the Chief Clerk and Attendant.**\n\nThe preceding entries, totaling nine matters, all pertain to the Dao of ingestion, exhalation and inhalation, and the visualization of mist and clouds.\n\n**Three entries of oral instructions transmitted by the Perfected Ones, comprising fifty-two matters in all.**\n*Master Deng’s Hidden Instructions on Ascending to Perfection, Scroll the Middle, concludes here.* #1 (Note: A character appears to be missing beneath 『名』.)\n\n---\n\n**Master Deng’s Hidden Instructions on Ascending to Perfection, Scroll the Lower**\n\n**Method for Reciting the *Yellow Court Scripture***\n**Method for Worship and Invocation**\n\nThe *Three-Nine Plain Speech Jade Essence True Instructions* states: The middle grade includes the *Three-Nine Plain Speech*, while the *Wei Transmissions* include the *Jade Essence True Instructions*. The *Three-Nine Plain Speech* likely refers to this scripture, though it has not circulated in the world. Spurious versions exist, but none contain these instructions.\n\nWhen reciting the *Eastern Florescence Jade Chapters of the Yellow Court Inner Radiance Scripture*, it is said to perform ten recitations and four bows. This scripture states, “At dawn, face the Supreme,” but here the three characters “face the Supreme” are omitted, and later it directs one to turn north to worship and invoke the Supreme. Does this not obscure the original intent? First, one pays homage to the Supreme Emperor, then turns north—yet the scripture’s preface contains no such instructions. It is said that the preface to the *Yellow Court* does not describe the method of paying homage. However, the fourteen characters within this scripture suffice to clarify the matter; why rely on an additional preface? Some commentaries suggest that upon reaching this point in recitation, one should face the four directions in homage—this, too, would require separate instructions. The present instructions for the *Yellow Court* derive from the *Plain Speech*, yet the high and low grades seem incongruous.\n\nThe Supreme Emperor resides in the east; thus, homage should be paid facing east. The Supreme Emperor is the Purple Dawn Lord. According to the *Entering the Dao and Gazing at Clouds*, one is to gaze southeast toward the Fusang and the Supreme Emperor amidst the Three Plain Flying Clouds. Moreover, the Fangzhu is located southeast of Kuaiji, while its northeast holds the Tang Valley. It is also said that Entering Stillness Mountain lies northeast of the Canglang, southeast of Penglai. Entering Ning Mountain is the abode governed by the Supreme Emperor. Furthermore, the Perfected Lord of Pure Emptiness, traveling east, crossed the Canglang at the Break of Dawn, ascended Broad Mulberry Mountain, entered the Court of First Radiance, and paid homage to the Supreme Emperor Lord. Thus, Fusang lies southeast of the Tang Valley, and from Jinling, it appears slightly south of due east. However, in the *Jade Register*, the Supreme Emperor bears no title of Purple Dawn. The present account contradicts these sources. If one must adhere to it, one should face due east. Therefore, when reciting the scripture, one faces east, and the instruction to first pay homage to the Supreme Emperor confirms its eastern location. Only afterward does one turn north to worship and invoke the Supreme. The Upper Clarity resides in the north, hence the scripture’s later directive to face north. One first performs the lighter act before proceeding to the weightier.\n\nUpon completing the ten recitations, rise and bow twice toward the Supreme Emperor. After bowing, kneel lengthily, close the eyes, and invoke:\n\n*“This humble servant [Name] respectfully recites the Golden Writ and Jade Scripture, which the Eastern Florescence calls the Jade Chapters. Now, invoking the Supreme Emperor, I refer to it as the Jade Scripture—is this not an overreach? Having completed ten cycles, I beseech to ascend the Dragon Plow. The scripture’s preface states that only after ten thousand recitations may one clearly perceive the five viscera, yet here, after a mere ten cycles, one begs to ascend the Dragon Plow—does this not defy the intent? This invocation is inferior to others, for from the outset it presumptuously seeks immortality and omits the required number of recitations. May the celestial spirits descend, command the Six Dings, cause my seven ancestors to ascend, and allow me to ascend to the Upper Clarity.”*\n\nYet the *Yellow Court* harmonizes the five viscera and refines the hun and po—it is not a method for ascending the seven ancestors. Moreover, the *Inner Yellow Court* merely ensures immortality; how could it enable ascent to the Upper Clarity? Furthermore, referring to oneself as “I” while addressing a superior violates the rites of humble supplication. The invocation to “fly and step” intermingles one’s name with “I,” a practice used when invoking stars to counter malevolent forces—not when directly addressing the Supreme Emperor.\n\nUpon finishing, open the eyes, swallow saliva ten times, and click the teeth nine times. If ten swallows constitute ten cycles, then the teeth-clicking should match. The meaning of nine cycles here is unclear.\n\nNext, turn north, bow twice, and kneel lengthily to invoke:\n\n*“Supreme August Perfect One, enable me to ascend to emptiness.” The Supreme August Perfect One is not an epithet of the Jade Dawn. “Enable me to ascend to emptiness” repeats the earlier error. In true methods of homage and invocation, only one’s name is used—there is no precedent for “your servant” or “I.” After purifying through fasting and refinement, reciting the Golden Writ, the Supreme calls it the *Zither-Heart Yellow Court*, yet here it speaks of Fusang—why do both invocations deviate? “May my seven ancestors disperse and ascend to the Emperor’s abode; after reciting the *Great Cavern* ten thousand times, may my seven ancestors attain immortality in the Nine Palaces.” Yet here, after reciting the *Yellow Court* ten times, one begs to attend the Emperor’s banquet—is this not excessive? “Prolong my years and preserve my existence; inscribe my name in the register.” First, one seeks to ascend to emptiness, then to prolong life—does this mean attaining high perfection only to revert to earthly immortality?\n\nUpon finishing, close the eyes, click the teeth nine times, and swallow saliva ten times. In the previous section, the eyes were opened; here, they are closed. The methods of clicking and swallowing are reversed, and though the two practices are not distinct, their postures differ. Taken as a whole, they violate true precedents. This likely stems from later students of shallow talent who established these methods arbitrarily, failing to distill the essence of the matter and thus introducing many contradictions. Successive generations have revered these deviations without scrutiny. For beginners who wish to follow them, no harm is done, but they do not align with my understanding. If one must observe them, they are not addressed in the true scriptures.\n\nAfter completing all rites, return to the usual recitation of the scripture.\n\n**Alternative Method for Visualizing the Spirits**\nThe Perfected Lord of Pure Emptiness states: In cultivating the *Yellow Court Inner Scripture*, one should follow the Dao of the Lord Emperor’s “Filling the Spirits and Blending the Mysterious True.”\n\nAccording to Master Pei’s studies and transmissions, nothing is lacking in the *Yellow Court* tradition. Yet this “Filling the Spirits and Blending the Mysterious True” is a spurious scripture of the present age, plagiarizing the method from the *Purple Capital’s Flame and Light Scroll*. Its descriptions of the spirits’ forms, lengths, invocations, and instructions are identical—thus, it compounds falsehood with further falsehood, a grave error.\n\nThe reason it is still included in this scroll is to prevent later students who may obtain it elsewhere from mistaking it for the true method. If they practice it diligently, believing it to be an essential instruction, they risk confusing the genuine with the spurious, leading to the loss of the true Dao. Therefore, its falsity is exposed here to awaken them.\n\nUpon completing the recitation and concluding the rites and invocations, sit upright facing east, close your eyes, and inwardly visualize the forms, colors, lengths, and sizes of the body’s spirits. Call their names and return them to their respective palaces.\n\nWithout practicing this method, even if one recites the scripture ten thousand times, the true spirits will not abide, and no efficacious response will arise. Instead, one will only deplete qi and exhaust the spirits, bringing no benefit to lifespan.\n\nThus, I have excerpted the essential passages from the scripture to demonstrate them.\n\nThe *Yellow Court*’s preface already fully records the methods of recitation. If these two matters remain unpracticed, there will be no efficacious response. Therefore, they must also be explained. Yet the text further discusses methods for averting fear, illness, and encounters with impurity, while entirely omitting the *Spirit Kings*.\n\nWould Master Wang truly not wish to provide clear and precise instructions? Given such omissions in the scripture, the principles remain incomplete, and there is nothing left to cultivate.\n\nSit upright, close your eyes, and knock the teeth thirty-six times. Then visualize the spirits. Since this is not a grand invocation to suppress evil, the subsequent practice of knocking the teeth thirty-six times (four sets of nine) and visualizing the spirits is absent from the scriptural examples.\n\nThe spirit of the hair, *Canghua*, is named *Taiyuan*, two inches and one *fen* in length.\nThe spirit of the brain, *Jinggen*, is named *Niwan*, one inch and two *fen* in length.\nThe spirit of the eyes, *Mingshang*, is named *Yingxuan*, three inches in length.\nThe spirit of the nose, *Yulong*, is named *Lingjian*, two inches and five *fen* in length.\nThe spirit of the ears, *Kongxian*, is named *Youtian*, three inches and one *fen* in length.\nThe spirit of the tongue, *Tongming*, is named *Zhenglun*, seven inches in length.\nThe spirit of the teeth, *Fenge*, is named *Luoqian*, one inch and five *fen* in length.\n\nThe seven spirits of the face above all wear purple robes and flying silk skirts, appearing in the form of infants. Visualize them clearly, arranged in order across the face, each returning to its palace.\n\nAccording to the scripture, there are seven names, but the eyes and ears are paired, making nine in total. This does not align with the *Eight Effulgences*, as each follows its respective location.\n\nThus, the scripture states: “The Nine Perfected of the *Niwan* all have chambers, each one inch square, dwelling within. Together they wear purple robes and flying silk garments.” These are the nine spirits mentioned earlier.\n\nIf this refers to the Nine Perfected of the nine palaces, then the purple robes and silk garments should not be mistaken. Those of discernment need only seek the truth in this, and they will naturally perceive the errors of true and false in the world.\n\nIt further states that they do not reside separately but all dwell within the brain, yet here they are described as arranged across the face—this contradicts the lengths of the five spirits of the hair, brain, eyes, nose, and tongue, which are plagiarized from the *Upper Effulgence* method. The spirits of the ears and teeth, which are absent there, are arbitrarily assigned measurements. How could the original author of this explanation dare to do such a thing?\n\nUpon completion, knock the teeth twenty-four times and swallow qi twelve times. These numbers again deviate from the principles of the seven spirits.\n\nInvoke:\n“Scattered qi of the numinous origin, coalescing qi to form spirits,\nDistinguishing front and back, governing the *Niwan* in unity,\nAbove and below supporting one another, the seven spirits arrayed,\nFlowing forms following transformation, nurturing the source of radiance,\nGuiding the eight numina, ascending through the cavernous gate,\nGuarding the body, treading the effulgence, ascending to the imperial dawn.”\n\nThis invocation is modeled after the *Eight Effulgences*, yet the spirits of the *Eight Effulgences* belong to the *Middle Effulgence* method of the *Shangqing* tradition. How can one now seek to guide them while subordinating the high to the low?\n\nNext, visualize the spirit of the heart, *Danyuan*, named *Shouling*, nine inches in length, wearing a red brocade flying skirt.\nThe spirit of the lungs, *Haohua*, named *Xucheng*, eight inches in length, dressed in white brocade with a yellow sash.\nThe spirit of the liver, *Longyan*, named *Hanming*, seven inches in length, wearing a green brocade cloak.\nThe spirit of the kidneys, *Xuanming*, named *Yuying*, three inches and six *fen* in length, clad in dark brocade.\nThe spirit of the spleen, *Changzai*, named *Hunting*, seven inches and three *fen* in length, wearing yellow brocade.\nThe spirit of the gallbladder, *Longyao*, named *Weiming*, three inches and six *fen* in length, dressed in nine-colored brocade with a green floral skirt.\n\nAll these garments are derived directly from the names in the original scripture. The lengths of the spirits also follow the *Middle Effulgence* tradition, though the gallbladder is reduced by one *fen* and the liver by one inch, presumably to indicate their difference.\n\nThe true spirits of the six bowels reside within the palaces of the five viscera and six bowels. Here, however, only the five viscera’s spirits are listed, with the gallbladder being the sole bowel mentioned. What is meant by “the true spirits of the six bowels residing within the five viscera”?\n\nThe scripture’s reference to the six bowels is a general designation, with no specific mention of their spirit-palaces. Moreover, the scripture states that they all circulate the *Heavenly Scripture* within the heart, so they cannot each reside within the palaces of the five viscera and six bowels.\n\nLater in the scripture, the six locations are further clarified—some as spirits, some as youths—with three upper and three middle, each displaying distinct attire and adornments. They are not all confined to the spirits of the five viscera.\n\nAppearing like infants, their colors like radiant youths, visualize them clearly, arranged in order within a single form. Such an arrangement starkly contradicts the claim that they all reside within the heart.\n\nKnock the teeth twenty-four times and swallow qi twelve times. Invoke:\n“The five viscera and six bowels, the true spirits return as one,\nTogether governing the *Crimson Palace*, above and below following,\nThe golden chamber’s red child, facing the four portals,\nThe dark chamber’s mysterious gate, the spirit-hall’s pivotal mechanism,\nBlending transformation to generate spirits, true qi refined,\nPreserving and binding the *Cinnabar Field*, shining with the sun’s radiance,\nAttaining union with the *Eight Effulgences*, merging forms to ascend and fly.”\n\nAccording to the twenty-four spirits, each of the five viscera and six bowels nurtures its own spirit. Here, however, the viscera and bowels are conflated, described as returning as one—this is a contradiction in practice.\n\nMoreover, the *Three Elders of the Hall of Light* are all clearly described in the scripture, with the middle section serving as the primary master of the *Yellow Court*. Yet here, none are visualized or invoked. How can one claim to employ visualization to ascend into the void?\n\nThe *Purple Tenuity* states: “In the past, Meng Guang recited the *Yellow Court* and practiced this method for eighteen years. The Perfected of the *Yellow Court* descended to her, but when she sought among the immortals—male and female—there was no Meng Guang. Only Liang Hong’s wife was called Meng Guang.”\n\nAfter reciting ten thousand times, the *Yellow Flower Jade Maiden* should reveal her feelings to you.\n\nWho, then, is this Perfected of the *Yellow Court*?\n\nShould the *Primordial Sovereign of the Lower Realm* deign to descend and appear alone, how could one lightly establish such a doctrine? To speak thus today is to entangle the net of principles—may future disciples take this as a profound warning. Here ends the secret transmission of the *Yellow Court*.\n\nThe spirits within the body may be contemplated from dawn to dusk, ever held in mind without forgetfulness; one need not wait for the recitation of scripture. Guard this well.\n\nThe rites of obeisance and the two methods of spirit visualization recorded here were both transmitted through mental transmission. From the Eastern Jin onward, no written record of them has existed. If secrecy were truly required, the crudeness and shallowness of these words and matters would reveal them as the fabrications of boastful and competitive impostors, who cobbled together this spurious scripture. I have recorded them here merely to distinguish truth from falsehood.\n\nComparing the two, the earlier section on rites of obeisance is slightly superior, while this text on spirit visualization is so convoluted, redundant, and vulgar as to risk misleading later students—its harm is not insignificant. If my judgment here is deemed incorrect, I invite all to seek out the authentic text and present it. Should such a text indeed exist, I shall seal my lips and bind my tongue, never again daring to speak of the study of the Dao.\n\n---\n\n**Entering Stillness**\nOral transmission from the *Orthodox Unity Perfected Realized One*, the *Three Heavens Master* Zhang [Daoling], to the *Lady of Southern Marchmount*.\n\nWhen the *Celestial Master* taught this transmission in Yangluo, the Lady had already immersed herself in the recitation of the *Cavern Scriptures* and mastered the manifold subtleties. Yet he still condescended to impart this minor art of the *Great Clarity*. Some in the world claim this was because the Lady had once served as a *Libationer*—but though she once held that office, it is no longer relevant today. Why then speak of it?\n\nSince this transmission was entrusted to the *Celestial Master*, and the Lady was bound by the duty to instruct those below, it was set forth for the world to guide the officials of *Orthodox Unity*. Moreover, those of low rank may not instruct the lofty perfected; thus, the title of *Libationer* is explicitly retained to clarify its connection.\n\nEvery word and phrase of the *Perfected Realized One* carries profound meaning. Only through meticulous discernment can one grasp its principles. Merely reciting and bowing without seeking to comprehend its divisions is like burying gold in the earth—what use is that?\n\nThe chapter on *Entering Stillness* and the methods for memorializing and treating illness are indeed among the highest canons of solemn authority, not to be casually overheard by careless *Libationers*.\n\n---\n\n**Method of Entering Stillness**\nThis text does not clearly state the meaning of *entering stillness*. Later, it mentions that one may dispense with ordinary morning and evening practices, suggesting that these refer to morning and evening obeisances, prostrations, supplications, or the submission of memorials. When treating illness, one should first perform these rites before proceeding with other matters.\n\nAccording to the transmission from *Lady Yi Qian*, one should \"morning and evening hold the heart in reverent stillness.\" This seems to prescribe the use of this method. If illness prevents physical performance, one may instead hold the heart in reverent stillness. Even those dwelling in mountains or living in the world may practice this. Though the language here is humble, it is intended for officials of this age, not necessarily for those who now dwell in mountain retreats.\n\nThose who maintain long fasts and abstain from grains, devoting themselves to lofty practices, need not physically attend but should hold their hearts in reverence without fail. As for the later method of the *Two Audiences*, it states that one should first perform the *Audience of Stillness* before proceeding. At the time, the Lady was still alive; how could she have already exhausted the teachings of Yangluo? If she had already received the *Judgment*, she should not have used it again later—there must have been a separate method for the *Audience of Stillness*.\n\nThere exists an ancient text on *Grain Paper* from Hanzhong, titled *Method of Entering Governance and Audience of Stillness*, which likely refers to this. Since we are now fortunate to possess this [transmission], we should employ it. If one also uses the Hanzhong method, only the words of the opening and closing incense rites need slight adjustment.\n\nFor morning and evening *entering stillness*, use the times of sunrise and sunset. These are not the moments when the sun is seen to rise or set, but rather the beginning of its passage through the *Circular Net*. If making a petition, use the hour of midnight, for the workings of the spirits are profound, and the *Perfected Realized One* rarely descends during the day.\n\nWhen first entering the chamber of stillness, gaze at the incense burner and silently recite: The *Southern Perfected* said: \"Hold the breath and bow in stillness, so that the hundred ghosts stand in awe. The *Merit Officers* and *Messengers*, the *Dragon* and *Tiger Lords*, may then appear and speak with you.\" This refers to holding the breath and visualizing at the outset, then reciting the incense prayer, exhaling, holding the breath again, and bowing to the four directions. After each direction, exhale.\n\nIt is further instructed: When entering the chamber of stillness, first step forward with the right foot, then bring the left foot forward to align with it. Only then proceed as usual, so that one’s petition may be clearly heard above.\n\nThis instruction likely applies not only to entering the eastern-facing chamber of stillness but to all places of petition. For matters of communicating with the unseen, the right foot should lead.\n\nIt is also said: When burning incense, do not look back, for to do so would offend the *true qi* and invite demonic responses. This means that once inside the chamber of stillness, one must not turn the head to look behind. However, if one turns to face outward directly, there should be no harm.\n\nAfter the *Two Audiences*, it is again stated: When exiting the chamber of stillness, do not look back, for to do so would offend the *true light* and invite insincerity. Thus, both entering and exiting the chamber of stillness forbid looking back.\n\nIt is further said: Do not call out to those outside or speak of other matters while in the chamber. Both entering and exiting require rinsing the mouth.\n\nThe intent here is that all officials and attendants within the chamber of stillness belong to the *Supreme Clarity* bureaucracy, where scrutiny is strict and regulations numerous. Failure to comply not only prevents resonance but may also invite misfortune and harm.\n\nNow, I set forth the proper sequence for *entering stillness* as follows:\n\nFirst, bathe and bind the sash to the east, comb the hair, arrange the garments, and ensure the headcloth and shoes are pure. Hold the tablet in both hands, without wrapping it in paper. Upon reaching the chamber door, rinse the mouth three times, hold the breath, step forward with the right foot, then bring the left foot forward to align with it, and stand evenly. Calm the heart and direct the gaze inward, visualizing the *Straightforward Messenger*, the *Orthodox Unity Merit Officers*, and the *Left and Right Official Messengers*—four in total—standing to either side within the chamber. The *Dragon Lord* stands to the left, the *Tiger Lord* to the right, with two *Incense-Bearing Messengers* flanking the incense burner, and the *Jade Maiden Guardians of Stillness* attending the desk. Once all are visualized, exhale, open the eyes, gaze directly at the incense burner, and silently recite:\n\nThe Most High Mysterious Origin Five Numinous Venerable Lord, summon the Merit Officers and Messengers, the Left and Right Dragon and Tiger Lords, the Incense-Bearing Messengers, the Three Qi Orthodox Spirits, and those who perform the Two Audiences—may clouds gather and the Scripture-Attending Divine Lads and Jade Maidens draw near.\n\nHasten to report to the Three Heavens’ Most High Mysterious Origin Dao Lord, and memorialize the Supreme Clarity Palace. I now burn incense, enter stillness, and present myself before the spirits, practicing the Eastern Florescence esoteric method. From the ninetieth day after my life-origin day, at dawn, I enter stillness to present myself before the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity. From the one hundred eighty-second day after my birth month, at midnight, I enter stillness to present myself before the Most High Lofty Sage Lord. May the Eight Directions’ Orthodox Qi enter my body, and may my petition swiftly ascend to the presence of the Emperor.\n\nBefore the Jade Tower and Purple Palace of the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity, beneath the Jasper Tower of the Most High Lofty Sage Lord.\n\nOnce done, burn incense and proceed. Exhale, advance the right foot to the incense burner, then bring the left foot forward to align with it. With the left hand, take three pinches of incense and burn them abundantly. As the Two Audiences are said to begin with silent audience, the incantation at the incense burner should not be limited to the silent audience but adapted to the occasion, roughly following the vermilion annotations for alternating use.\n\nAfter burning the incense, first withdraw the right foot, then bring the left foot back to align with it. Observe the rising smoke, hold the breath, and bow. Initially, bow twice. This is called the Bow of Stillness, and the method of stillness naturally requires facing east. Upon first entering and reciting at the incense burner, one faces west, so it is not reiterated here.\n\nPlace a square mat in the center of the stillness chamber, with one incense burner and one incense box, facing all four directions. Later, if entering stillness due to illness, burn incense in all four directions, arranging four incense burners. Place four incense mats at the four sides, each not touching the walls. Enter the center and bow in sequence. Upon first entering, recite at the incense burner within the chamber, facing west. Then enter the center and burn incense in all four directions, concluding with a single recitation facing west.\n\nIf the scripture hall faces south, this method cannot be used, and there are no Merit Officers, Dragon or Tiger Lords—only the Scripture-Attending Divine Lads and Jade Maidens. If presenting oneself before the Most High Primordial Noon Attainment, one may remain in the scripture hall.\n\nAfter completing the dawn and dusk Bows of Stillness, return before the scriptures, burn incense again, and invoke the host of Perfected Ones, seeking immortality and the fulfillment of wishes. Other petitions to the Celestial Emperor, requests to officials for healing, disaster eradication, or blessings—all are conducted within stillness.\n\nAfter bowing, strike the chest three times, then bow four times in total. Kneel and place the tablet before oneself. Strike the chest with both hands, then take up the tablet again, stating one’s name (male or female), and solemnly report:\n\nI humbly report to the Heavenly Master, the Female Master, and the Lineage Master—the Three Masters—and to the Attending Officers and Clerks of the Gate. May I receive the Orthodox Unity Three Qi to nourish my form and spirit, causing the Five Viscera to flourish and the Six Palaces to flow freely. May the disasters of the four directions be dispelled, the calamities of seven generations dissolved, and may I attain long life and enduring vision, becoming a flying immortal.\n\nConclude with two more bows. Before the Han dynasty, there were also Heavenly Masters—likely three in number, including one woman, though not necessarily kin.\n\nThe Orthodox Unity Qi is rooted in the Master, so one first bows and invokes them, then faces north. The initial two bows with chest-striking express grief and supplication; the subsequent two bows express gratitude for virtue. In all such cases, the order of bowing follows the intent of the matter.\n\nNext, face north and bow twice, striking the chest three times, and say:\n\nI humbly report to the Supreme August Most High Northern Great Dao Lord. I, a flesh-born mortal and withered-bone descendant, beseech the erasure of the thousand sins and myriad transgressions—hidden evils and offenses against the Three Officials—accumulated from seven generations past to my present self. May fortune arise in the five directions, calamities vanish in the nine yin, and no hundred ghosts or wayward spirits dare oppose me. May I envision divine immortals and jade maidens descending, attaining long life and enduring vision, my lifespan equaling the Three Luminaries.\n\nConclude with two more bows. The Northern Great Dao Lord is the most exalted Perfected of the Grand Clarity, so one bows to them after paying respects to the Master.\n\nNext, face east and bow twice, striking the chest three times, and say:\n\nI humbly report to the Grand Clarity Mysterious Origin Most High Three Heavens Boundless Great Dao, the Most High Venerable Lord, the Most High Elder, the Celestial Emperor, the Celestial Elder, the Nine Elders of the Immortal Capital, the Nine Qi Elder, the myriad layers of Dao Qi, the Twelve Hundred Official Lords, and the Jade Court of the Grand Clarity. May my heart open and my mind awaken, my ears and eyes grow keen, and the myriad immortals convene in council to bestow upon me the Jade Elixir. May disasters be dispelled, calamities averted, and immortality attained. May my worldly rank be noble, golden chariots enter my gate, and all slanderous misfortunes—thousands of calamities and myriad afflictions—be eradicated at once. May my record in the Three Offices be expunged, and may I receive the grace of the Three Heavens’ Elder.\n\nConclude with two more bows. These Grand Clarity Official Lords govern the fortunes and misfortunes of all beings as the rightful stewards of the Three Heavens, so one bows to them next.\n\nNext, face south and bow twice, striking the chest three times, and say:\n\nI humbly report to the Southern Great Dao Lord. May my name be inscribed in the Jade Register of Divine Immortals and announced to the various Lords of Destiny, securing long life as my fate. May the Ten Thousand Blessings Lord of the Three Heavens be commanded to bring treasures from the four directions and silks and grains from the eight, amassing boundless wealth. May my meritorious deeds be enacted, all endeavors succeed, and every wish be fulfilled as if by the work of my own hands. May I attain long life and immortality, my lifespan equaling heaven and earth.\n\n[Note: The character *sheng* (生) was originally *jiu* (久), later altered to *sheng*; here, it should follow the original meaning of \"long-lasting.\"]\n\nConclude with two more bows. This is the Grand Clarity’s Southern Dao Lord, whose rank is inferior to the Northern Great Dao Lord, hence lacking the august title of Supreme August Most High. Thus, one bows to them last. There are thirty-six such Lords, and this one ranks among the lesser.\n\nThis Lord of Myriad Blessings is still but an official-general, one who presides over treasures and wealth. The fifteenth scroll of the seventh fascicle of the *Rites of the Twelve Hundred Offices* states: \"There are twenty-eight Supreme Myriad Blessings Clerks and one hundred twenty official-generals, who govern the five directional benefits—gold, silver, coins, silks, cloth, silk floss, grains, and rice—ensuring that whatever is desired arrives at once. These are overseen by Huang Sheng.\"\n\nAdditionally, the thirteenth scroll of the third fascicle records five Lords of Myriad Blessings and one hundred twenty official-generals, who dispel stale qi, essence-wraiths, and afflicting qi, averting death and summoning life, turning misfortune into fortune, and bringing whatever is desired to fruition.\n\nThis concludes the rite.\n\nIf one bows in the four directions, it serves to avert misfortune and summon fortune, with all desires fulfilled as wished. The practice of bowing in the four directions is typically employed in times of urgent illness or distress; under ordinary circumstances at dawn and dusk, it need not be performed.\n\nWhen bowing in the four directions, one should first face and invoke one direction, then bow, and further strike one’s breast, declaring one’s present entreaty. One may also remove one’s headscarf and weep bitterly, depending on the urgency of the matter. Once finished, bow twice more. The same procedure applies to the remaining directions.\n\nHaving concluded the rite, turn to face east and burn incense, invoking the officials to beseech deliverance from present afflictions, all in accordance with the methods described below. Speak softly in all cases, and the dawn and dusk bowing rituals remain as previously sufficient.\n\nBefore exiting the chamber of stillness, stand directly before the incense burner and utter a whispered prayer. Then turn west, hold the breath, gaze upon the burner, and whisper the prayer again. The initial prayer is called the \"prayer of the heart,\" while this is termed the \"whispered prayer,\" requiring only the slightest movement of the lips.\n\nO Fragrant Officials and Envoys, Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, may this chamber of stillness suddenly manifest auspicious herbs, golden elixir and cinnabar essence, with a hundred spirits converging before this fragrant flame. Let Zhang of Jia state his surname, and Jia state his given name; if only a single name is provided, simply declare it as such.\n\nMay the qi of attaining the Dao grant transcendence as a divine immortal, bringing ten thousand blessings to the entire household. For those dwelling in mountain retreats far from worldly burdens, say: \"May the mountain abode receive ten thousand blessings.\" May all, great and small, receive grace, and may the jade maidens guarding the four directions in stillness—along with the jade maidens attending the scriptures and the divine youths at the two audiences—together with the guardians of the fragrant smoke, record these words of mine and transmit them directly to the jade throne before the Jade Emperor at the Gate of the Three Heavens.\n\nAt the two audiences, speak also of the jade throne before the Heavenly Emperor of the Dao Lord in the Supreme Clarity Palace of the Grand Tenuity Heaven, and the jade throne before the Most High and Sagely Jade Dawn Dao Lord in the Supreme Palace of Supreme Clarity.\n\nThen exit the chamber. Within the doorway, rinse the mouth, first stepping out with the left foot, then the right, without looking back. The rite is complete.\n\nIf the affliction is urgent or other matters require petition, proceed as the situation demands, appending them afterward as one sees fit. In all cases, speak softly, ensuring the voice does not rise. All follows as previously annotated. This is the method of entering governance through stillness and audience, as practiced in Hanzhong.\n\nFirst face east and declare: \"May I, Jia, rejoice in life and delight in vitality. I humbly beseech the Lords and Elders of all directions to grant me long life and enduring vision, to prolong my years and augment my longevity, that I may become one of the seed-people and abide with Heaven and Earth. May the disasters and misfortunes of Jia’s household be dispelled, all illnesses healed of themselves, divine luminaries attach to my body, and my heart open with enlightened understanding.\"\n\nNext face north: \"I, Jia, desire to turn from evil toward goodness. I humbly beseech the Supreme Mystery’s Most Exalted One to pardon my transgressions, absolve my karmic retributions, deliver me from calamities, and repel the clutches of worldly authorities. May all I face yield like metal and stone, water and fire be extinguished, malevolent rebels submit, and pernicious spirits disperse.\"\n\nThen face west: \"I, Jia, delight in the Dao and rejoice in immortality. I humbly beseech the Heavenly Master to grant what I desire and fulfill what I undertake. May my heart open and understanding deepen, my ears and eyes grow keen, all illnesses vanish, and my body become light and strong.\"\n\nFinally face south: \"I, Jia, cultivate the body and nurture my nature, seeking to return to youth and reverse aging. I humbly beseech the Lord of Virtue and Dao to bestow the qi of gracious moisture upon my bones and frame, that the qi of the Dao may flow freely. May my entire being be enveloped in compassionate favor, all illnesses dispelled, and blessings and fortune gather. I entreat the Lord of Myriad Fortunes to bring wealth from all directions, advancing my livelihood and increasing my gains, that all I pursue may come to fruition.\"\n\nThis is the text for the four directional audiences, known as the *Rightward Progression Method*, identical to that described in the Purple Gate, though without prescribed sequence. The prayers at the incense burner for the four directions share a similar essence, though their substance is somewhat less refined than what follows.\n\n**Petitions and Talismans**\nFor urgent matters requiring a petition, use cinnabar to inscribe the heading. In cases of sudden illness, disaster, or pressing concerns—such as invoking the Heavenly Prosperity Lord and others to submit a petition for deliverance—write in cinnabar: \"By the authority of the Orthodox Unity of the Great Clarity, the Celestial Master [Name], the Master of Qi and Libationer, your servant [Name].\" Below, in smaller script, add the servant’s surname and affiliation, followed by the year, month, and day under the Three Heavenly Bureaus. Once this cinnabar heading is affixed, the petition may be submitted. This is akin to the red-marked talismans used by officials for urgent matters today.\n\nTo submit a petition for expelling ghosts, inscribe the name of the libationer to whom it is addressed. For households plagued by malevolent and powerful ghosts, invoke the Rightward Immortal Lord of Aerial Qi and others to drive them away. The petitioner need not use cinnabar for the heading but may simply write: \"Submitted by Libationer [Name] of [Place], your servant [Surname].\"\n\nFor petitions to treat demonic illnesses, use blue paper, as the Three Officials’ demon-quelling officers favor this color. For afflictions caused by licentious or demonic qi, or by spirits haunting temples and shrines, invoke the Heavenly Equilibrium Lord and others to subdue them. The petition should be written in cinnabar on blue paper, which may be cut into strips according to the number of copies needed.\n\nFor illnesses caused by qi-inflicting ghosts, compose a *Striking Ghost Petition*. For households troubled by vengeful ghosts from ancestral tombs, litigation, or untimely deaths, invoke the Four Hu Generals of the High Granary and others to attack and disperse them. Once the petition is complete, grind it with two *fen* of pure cinnabar (equivalent to one modern *liang*). Combine the ground petition with honey to form pills, which should be taken all at once in the early morning while facing north after bowing twice. Even those on the brink of death may be revived. The grinding and mixing must be done in secret, lest the patient’s hun-soul be disturbed and ghostly qi dare to interfere. This method may also be applied to other illnesses.\n\nIf the patient is capable, they should grind and mix the pills themselves; otherwise, the libationer submitting the petition may do so. First soak the paper in honey to soften it, then grind it thoroughly into pills. The petition itself should not exceed two sheets, and the resulting pills will not be numerous. They must be taken in one dose, washed down with clear water, and not divided into multiple servings. While this method is particularly effective for striking ghosts, it may also be used for other ailments.\n\nWhen composing a petition, use separate brushes and inkstones, avoiding contamination. Even the ink should be distinct. However, brushes and inkstones used for copying scriptures may be shared without issue, provided they are not used for mundane correspondence.\n\nWhen grinding ink, rotate the inkstick counterclockwise forty-nine times and stop. Repeat the grinding process forty-nine times. The counterclockwise motion follows the celestial sequence, beginning in the east. The number forty-nine corresponds to the *Dayan* method of divination with milfoil stalks, enabling communication with the unseen and the divine. This practice reflects the meticulous precision required in Daoist study, where every action aligns with cosmic patterns—far from being a casual endeavor.\n\nWhen writing a petition, burn incense and face north. Use fine paper and brushes, ensuring all utensils—cloths, desks, and other implements—are clean and cool. Wear the sash on the left, sit reverently, and write with care. The ink’s consistency and the brush’s strokes should be well-balanced. Seal the petition in an envelope with paste and submit it according to the proper method.\n\nCurrently, there is no standardized template for petitions, and many are carelessly edited by libationers, rendering them unreliable for use. One should adhere to the *Rituals of the Twelve Hundred Officials*, selecting the appropriate deities from the twenty-four officials based on the matter at hand. Begin by detailing the root of the affliction, then confess transgressions and acknowledge faults before invoking the officials for deliverance, keeping the tone humble. If offerings such as gold foil, blue paper, or oil are required, specify the quantities and list the names of the summoned officers and soldiers, avoiding ambiguity. The petition should not include vague promises of offerings; the same applies to verbal declarations.\n\nFor suspended offerings, deliver them promptly upon the resolution of the matter, presenting the specified items. These offerings should be distributed to the Celestial Master, dispersed among mountain-dwelling scholars, or used for Daoist purposes. They must not be appropriated for personal use, such as clothing or food, as the Three Officials scrutinize such matters closely.\n\nAccording to the Lesser Lord, for households experiencing illness, death, misfortune, strange phenomena, disturbing dreams, or financial decline, exorcism may be performed. However, the most urgent matters requiring resolution are ancestral tomb disputes and grave-related afflictions. Failure to address these will ensure the continuation of misfortune.\n\nIt is further stated that one may submit a memorial regarding tomb disputes, and I shall petition on their behalf.\n\nMaster Fan Zhonghou also said: Therefore, one should earnestly submit memorials concerning *fengzhu* (wind-inflicted) tomb disputes. These instructions were given to the Xu family, and even the Xu family, with their meritorious works, still regard tomb disputes as urgent matters—how much more so for ordinary people? When such memorials are submitted with proper reasoning, they will surely bring profound benefit.\n\nYet today, not only are the memorials poorly composed, but it is also difficult to find a qualified *jijiu* (libationer). Hasty submissions are like casting words into the void, only inviting further transgressions and malevolent influences.\n\nThe essence of tomb dispute memorials need not exceed two or three sheets of paper, yet in the world, they have expanded to dozens. I fear that all memorials, talismans, and the like follow this pattern.\n\nThe rites for summoning officials originally derive from the ancient methods of Hanzhong. For healing illnesses, miscellaneous matters, and all memorial submissions, one may only summon the *gongcao* (functionaries), *lishi* (clerks), and *bing* (soldiers) from the immortal registers one bears, as well as the local *zhen’guan* (true officials) and *zhengshen* (orthodox deities). Yet people today universally employ the generals, clerks, and soldiers from the Yellow and Red Inner Registers—how can these be properly invoked? They merely seek grandeur in numbers, heedless of the transgression of overstepping their authority. This blind adherence, passed down through generations, has become standard practice—truly lamentable.\n\nDuring the Taixing era of the Jin, I once saw the memorial drafts of Li Dong, the *jijiu* of Qu’a, which were concise yet precise in their wording and matters. Later practitioners, however, omitted reverence to the Supreme Lord (*Taishang*) and the Three Heavenly Bureaus of the *Yin-Yang* Judges, instead invoking the Lords of Dragon-Tiger and citing reign titles of emperors past, omitting the Tai Sui (Year Star). These were all correct practices.\n\nYet in today’s memorials, the fine print omits the Supreme Dao Lord (*Taishang Daojun*) and fails to face north, addressing only the various officials of the Great Clarity. How then can one claim reverence for the Supreme Lord? Other discrepancies abound, but I shall not enumerate them all.\n\nLi Dong was a talented *jijiu*, and thus was appointed as a master in the underworld, initially ranked in the first tier. He has since been promoted, so his methods may still be followed. He frequently submitted memorials on behalf of the Xu family, which is why the Central Lord (*Zhongjun*) mentioned him.\n\nIf one enters seclusion due to illness, burn incense on all four sides and place four incense burners. This is for the time of prostrating and verbally petitioning the four directions for aid—it is not the method for submitting memorials. The proper method for memorials requires facing only east.\n\nThe procedures for setting up the altar have already been noted earlier.\n\nFor major matters, one may report merits of three or four hundred; for those on the verge of death, merits of five hundred; for minor matters, one or two suffice. Excessive claims will provoke the displeasure of the *qi*-governing functionaries and weary the summoned officials.\n\nThis refers to submitting memorials or verbal petitions to the various lords, generals, clerks, soldiers, and the *gongcao* officials within one’s own body to resolve a particular matter. Upon the matter’s resolution, one enters seclusion to report these merits and petition the Three Heavenly Registrars to confer ranks accordingly.\n\nIf one initially submits a memorial, subsequent merit reports must also be in memorial form; if one initially makes a verbal petition, subsequent merit reports must likewise be verbal. Mixing the two will cause the Heavenly Bureaus to find discrepancies in their records, resulting in punishment. The number of merits reported should correspond to the gravity of the matter, ranging from one or two up to fifty, a hundred, or even four or five hundred, as appropriate. Each should be measured with sincerity.\n\nWhen writing talismans, one must first purify oneself through ablution before proceeding. Face the monthly branch, hold the breath, and write.\n\nThe method for writing talismans: first outline the four sides with green ink, then write the talismanic text within in red. If green ink is unavailable, red may be used instead. This describes the method for emergency talismans, but all talismans should generally follow this approach.\n\nGreen ink is made by finely grinding *kongqing* (azurite), mixing it with thick glue and water to form pellets, and drying them in the sun. When needed, grind them as one would ink.\n\nFor talismans to treat demonic illnesses, use tiger bone and cinnabar, ground together. After grinding, dip the brush and write the talisman. Tiger bone should first be pounded into fine powder, sifted through double-layered silk, then mixed with cinnabar in a ratio of two parts cinnabar to three parts bone, combined with glue and water, and used to write the talisman. All talismans for repelling ghosts should follow this method.\n\nThis talisman-writing method originally appeared after the section on emergency talismans. It has been excerpted here to accompany the discussion of memorials, though it does not follow the original order.\n\n**Requesting Officials**\nFor urgent matters requiring a memorial, one may request the Yellow-Clad Soldiers of the Heavenly Prosperity Lord (*Tianchang Jun*), numbering one hundred thousand. Alternatively, one may enter seclusion, face east, and verbally petition them to capture the one hundred and twenty inauspicious and monstrous beings within and beyond the household, as well as the twelve *xing* (punitive) and *sha* (killing) ghosts.\n\n\"Urgent matters\" refer to sudden crises, not merely illnesses. Household misfortunes, calamities, and illnesses all stem from tomb disputes, so these officials are commanded to capture the various harms within the tomb.\n\nThis verbal petition facing east should follow the structure of a memorial, with a complete beginning and end, differing only in the absence of paper and ink. People today call this a \"verbal memorial.\" In the second fascicle of the *One Thousand Two Hundred Official Rites*, it states that for nightmares and confusion, one should request the Yellow-Clad Soldiers of the Heavenly Prosperity Lord, one hundred thousand in number, to capture the one hundred and twenty inauspicious and monstrous beings within and beyond the household, as well as the twelve *xing* and *sha* ghosts, and eradicate all that disturb one’s dreams. The rites for robes and other items are as described, so the character for \"tomb\" (*zhong*) should be written as \"household\" (*jia*), as twenty characters appear to have been omitted.\n\nThe names and titles of the palaces and bureaus responsible for various matters often differ slightly. All are written in red and recorded accordingly. This sequence is still drawn from the *Official Rites*, though with minor variations. The *Official Rites* lack the latter Three Officials, and I do not know how this came to be. The *Official Rites* have been transmitted for a long time, and errors in transcription have led to doubts about certain characters for some officials. Nevertheless, one may still rely on them for reference, as in the case of resolving misfortunes through *yunqi* (cosmic cycles). It is clear that this transmission has omissions.\n\nFor afflictions of the face, submit a memorial or enter seclusion to request the Five Heavenly Bright Lords (*Tianming Jun*) and one hundred twenty officials and generals under the Southern Palace (*Nanji Gong*), who govern illnesses of the face.\n\nGenerally, when it is said that [the officials] reside in the various palaces, this refers to the palaces of the Three Qi of the Great Clarity (*Taiqing*), the bureaus to which afflictions and misfortunes are traced, and the offices through which lords and officials operate. Thus, they are first summoned to their respective palaces before descending to administer treatment.\n\nWhen it speaks of \"five lords\" (*jun wu ren*), this refers to their shared governance with one hundred twenty officials and generals. When it simply says \"lord\" (*jun*), this denotes a single individual.\n\nThe *Rites* state: For a man suffering from pain in both eyes, invoke the Five Heavenly Bright Lords (*Tianming Jun*), along with one hundred twenty officials and generals under the Southern Palace (*Nanji Gong*), who also govern the left eye. For a woman suffering from pain, invoke the Five Earthly Bright Lords (*Diming Jun*), along with one hundred twenty officials and generals under the Northern Palace (*Beili Gong*), who also govern the right eye. Offerings of silk, grain, and coin are to be made.\n\nFor coughing, counterflow of qi, upward surging breath, vomiting, or diarrhea of green, yellow, red, or white [substances], or for the six kinds of *gu* poison and *chi* demons, invoke the Great Mechanism Lord (*Daji Jun*) of the Northern Palace, along with one hundred twenty officials and generals under the Supreme Balance Palace (*Taiheng Gong*). These *wen* poisons and *ba* demons encompass epidemic and pestilential illnesses, as well as wind-malaria and various afflictions, all of which arise from them.\n\nThe *Rites* state: For chest pain and fullness, upward surging breath, and coughing, invoke the Great Mechanism Lord of the Northern Palace and one hundred twenty officials and generals to administer treatment at the Supreme Balance Palace, expelling the six *ba* demons of the five *wen* poisons through vomiting and diarrhea. Offerings of brooms, paper, and brushes are to be made.\n\nFor distension and fullness in the chest and abdomen, urgency and cramping in the lower abdomen, or the twelve diseases of vaginal discharge, invoke the Sealed Separation Lord (*Fengli Jun*) to administer treatment. The diseases of vaginal discharge afflict not only women but men as well. All twelve conditions below the waist and in the yin regions are included.\n\nThe *Rites* state: For distension and fullness in the chest and abdomen, cramping and sharp pain below the navel, invoke the Twelve Sealed Separation Lords to govern the twelve diseases of vaginal discharge in men and women. Offerings of grain are to be made.\n\nFor undigested food in the abdomen, persistent hardness, or unceasing dripping discharge, submit a memorial or make an oral petition, and invoke the Red Essence Lord (*Chisu Jun*) and one hundred twenty officials and generals to administer treatment. This refers to abdominal masses and obstructions that harm digestion, or long-standing dripping discharge.\n\nWhen it says \"make an oral petition\" (*qi shi*), this means facing east and verbally petitioning, having first completed the four directions’ obeisance. This is done before invoking the matter, though it is not as formal as submitting a memorial.\n\nThe *Rites* state: For undigested food in the abdomen, persistent hardness, or unceasing dripping discharge, invoke the Red Essence Lord, along with one hundred twenty officials and generals, to administer treatment at the Six *Wu* Palace (*Liuwu Gong*). For women, invoke the White Essence Lord (*Baisu Jun*) and one hundred twenty officials and generals to administer treatment at the Yin Palace (*Yin Gong*). Offerings of grain are to be made according to the *Rites*.\n\nVolume Three, Part One also states: The Five Essence Lords, along with one hundred twenty officials and generals, administer treatment at the Upper Numinous Palace (*Shangling Gong*), governing all illnesses of men and enabling the writing of petitions. The Five White Essence Lords, along with one hundred twenty officials and generals, administer treatment at the Yang Brightness Palace (*Yangming Gong*), governing all illnesses of women and enabling the writing of petitions. Here, the names are the same, but the functions differ.\n\nFor counterflow of qi causing constriction and urgency, or the inability to retain food in the abdomen, submit a memorial or make an oral petition, and invoke the Five Celestial Balance Lords (*Wuheng Jun*) of the Celestial Bureau, along with one hundred twenty officials and generals under the Supreme Peace Palace (*Taiping Gong*), to administer treatment. This encompasses all qi-related illnesses, including leg qi, running piglet, and coughing.\n\nThough the subsequent passages no longer mention submitting memorials or making oral petitions—omitted for brevity—they remain unchanged in substance.\n\nThe *Rites* state: For inability to retain food or drink, or qi constricting the abdomen, invoke the Five Celestial Balance Lords of the Celestial Bureau and one hundred twenty officials and generals to administer treatment at the Supreme Peace Palace. Offerings of grain, clothing, paper, and brushes are to be made.\n\nFor severe vomiting and diarrhea, invoke the Five Celestial Balance Lords of the Earthly Bureau, along with one hundred twenty officials and generals under the Supreme Peace Palace, to administer treatment. This governs sudden vomiting and diarrhea, as well as chronic diarrhea, including cholera.\n\nThe *Rites* state: For a woman’s counterflow vomiting, invoke the Five Celestial Balance Lords of the Earthly Bureau and one hundred twenty officials and generals to administer treatment at the Supreme Peace Palace. Offerings are the same as above.\n\nWhen the *Rites* mention officials with \"Celestial\" or \"Earthly\" in their names, this distinguishes their governance over men and women.\n\nFor distension, fullness, and sharp pain in the lower abdomen, invoke the Nine Rivers and Northern Sea Lords (*Jiuhe Beihai Jun*), along with one hundred twenty officials and generals at the River Gate Palace (*Hedui Gong*), to administer protection and treatment. This governs all conditions of lower abdominal blockage, distension, and obstruction, as well as lip swelling. Simply petition this lord to command the officials and generals to administer treatment.\n\nThe *Rites* state: For lower abdominal distension and fullness, invoke the Nine Rivers and Four Seas Lords, along with one hundred twenty officials and generals, to administer treatment at the River Gate Palace, governing distension, fullness, and joint obstruction. Offerings of clothing, salt, and ritual implements are to be made.\n\nFor illnesses caused by well and hearth ghosts (*jing chong gui*), invoke the Five Kings of the Law (*Wangfa Jun*), along with one hundred twenty officials and generals at the Five Surnames Palace (*Wuxing Gong*), to subdue and eliminate them. This refers to afflictions from offending well and hearth spirits, seeking divination or knowledge, or illness caused by offerings of food and drink. This lord governs their treatment.\n\nThe *Rites* state: For offenses against the hearth ghost... [text corrupt].\n\nFor carbuncles, abscesses, and malignant sores, invoke the Nine Assembled Lords (*Jiuji Jun*), along with one hundred twenty officials and generals at the Former Kings’ Palace (*Xianwang Gong*), to descend and administer treatment. This also governs all sores. It further governs wounds from metal, fire, or bites from dogs, horses, snakes, and insects.\n\nThe *Rites* state: For sores, carbuncles, and abscesses on the head, face, eyes, or body, invoke the Five Kings of the Law, along with one hundred twenty officials and generals, to administer treatment at the Five Surnames Palace. Also invoke the Nine Marquises Lord (*Jiuhou Jun*), along with one hundred twenty officials and generals, to administer treatment at the Former Kings’ Palace. Offerings of miscellaneous clothing, grain, paper, and brushes are to be made.\n\nHere, the Kings of the Law are distinguished as governing well and hearth ghosts, which differs from the above. Yet the *Rites* also state that carbuncles, abscesses, and malignant sores arise from offenses against the twelve hearth ghosts. Thus, these illnesses are not separate from those caused by well and hearth spirits.\n\nFor emaciation, bone wasting, and flesh depletion leading to exhaustion, invoke the Celestial Bureau’s Yang Order Lord (*Yangzhi Jun*), along with one hundred twenty officials and generals and one hundred twenty left and right attendants, to administer treatment. This refers not to a specific ailment but to chronic emaciation and debilitation leading to exhaustion.\n\nThe *Rites* state: For conditions of urinary dripping, depletion, and emaciation—where bones waste away and flesh is consumed—beyond the reach of physicians’ treatment, invoke the Celestial Bureau’s Yang Order Lord (*Yangzhi Jun*), along with one hundred twenty officials and generals and one hundred twenty left and right attendants, as well as seventy-two left and right *qi*-affliction attendants, to govern the spirits of urinary dripping and the hundred diseases. Offerings of grain are to be made.\n\nTo open the Gate of Life for the afflicted and augment their lifespan, invoke the Southern Supreme Lord (*Nan Shang Jun*), with one hundred twenty officials and generals, stationed in the Granary and Fruit Palace, to extend their years and prevent death. This refers to cases where, after summoning other officials to treat and protect against the illness, these additional officials are further invoked to prolong the patient’s allotted years, ensuring death does not result from the present affliction. Such invocations are not to be made unless for the purpose of healing.\n\nThe *Rites* further state: For flying influx (*feizhu*) entering the abdomen and lodging in the chest, ribs, or back, invoke the Southern Supreme Lord (*Nan Shang Jun*), with one hundred twenty officials and generals, to govern the Granary and Fruit Palace, open the Gate of Life, and augment the patient’s lifespan. The illness will then resolve within three days, dispelling misfortune and removing the influx. Offerings of silk and paper money are to be made.\n\nFor those bedridden with chronic, severe illness, invoke the Momentary Lord (*Xuyu Jun*), with twenty officials and generals, to administer treatment.\n\nFor those who suffer from long-standing illnesses that do not resolve, this official and his generals—stated here as twenty—may be a textual omission of the character for \"hundred,\" though it may also suffice to follow the given number of twenty without presuming to increase it.\n\nThe *Rites* state: For dysentery with red and white pus, incontinence confining one to bed, and a bitter, cold mouth, invoke the Momentary Lord (*Xuyu Jun*) with four attendants, one hundred twenty officials and generals, and offer grains of rice.\n\nTo suppress and eradicate malevolent ghosts within a household, ensuring the cessation of spectral afflictions, invoke the Stone Immortal Lord (*Shi Xian Jun*) with one attendant, one hundred twenty officials and generals, to govern and extinguish them.\n\nWhen a household is plagued by wandering souls, violent ghosts of those who died away from home, or various spectral afflictions causing misfortune and decline, the *Rites* state: For illnesses that spread and shift uncontrollably, invoke the Stone Immortal Lord with one attendant and one hundred twenty officials and generals—some texts say to govern the Palace of Harm. To suppress and eradicate strong, lingering ghosts that bring spectral afflictions, offer provisions for their service.\n\nThe fourteen officials, detailed in the first scroll, govern the limits of all illnesses. To repel residual *qi*, sever spectral influxes, avert death and invite life, and transform misfortune into fortune, invoke the Heaven-Covering Great General (*Gai Tian Da Jiangjun*) with one hundred thousand troops to capture and restrain them.\n\nWhen a household is burdened by lingering *qi* of deceased ancestors that remain unresolved, continuing to bring influxes, harm, and misfortune, the *Rites* state: The Heaven-Covering Great General with one hundred thousand troops governs the capture of all wandering and malevolent ghosts that afflict the people through food and drink. This is the sole official and ritual recorded in the third scroll.\n\nAcross the eight scrolls, only the first includes offerings; the rest are incomplete. If one wishes to establish offerings, they may follow the prescribed model.\n\nTo capture and restrain the various ancient spirits that invade households, invoke the Supreme Primordial Noble Lords (*Wu Shang Yuan Shi Jun*) with five attendants and one hundred twenty officials and generals. Between Heaven and Earth, there exist all manner of ancient spirits capable of transformations and invasions, demanding sacrifices from households—these should be captured and restrained.\n\nThe *Rites* state: The Supreme Primordial Noble Lords with five attendants and one hundred twenty officials and generals govern the capture of all ancient spirits,杂神, and self-proclaimed officials that harm the people.\n\nIf divination reveals that an illness is caused by conflicts with one’s year of fate, life destiny, the Earth’s dominion, the tomb’s cyclical phase, or the constructive and destructive forces of the calendar, invoke the Earth-Restraining Lords (*Zhi Di Jun*) with five attendants and one hundred twenty officials and generals to govern the Palace of Appropriate Springs, suppressing and dissolving these influences. Unless one is a transcendent of the highest order, all face the declines and adversities of fate, as well as the consequences of their actions. To resolve conflicts with the Earth’s dominion, the *qi* of the tomb’s cyclical phase, the constructive and destructive forces of the calendar, and other taboos—all of which lead to illness—these must be dissolved.\n\nThe *Rites* state: The Earth-Restraining Lords with five attendants and one hundred twenty officials and generals govern the Palace of Appropriate Springs, capturing all ghosts of high and low merit, as well as those tied to the Earth Deity of one’s year of fate and life destiny.\n\nIf a household is troubled by litigious ghosts or unrighteous *qi*, causing unrest, invoke the Four Hu Lords (*Si Hu Jun*) with five attendants and one hundred twenty officials and generals to dissolve and sever them. This refers to ancestral misfortunes that linger, causing descendants to suffer repeated setbacks and instability. Such cases require only dissolution and severance, not eradication, for these are the workings of karmic misfortune, and descendants must not act with defiance. Many such precedents exist.\n\nThe *Rites* state: The Four Hu Lords with five attendants and one hundred twenty officials and generals govern the regulation of ancestral sacrifices, the pacification of households, the suppression of unrighteous *qi*, the resolution of litigious conflicts, and the separation of purity from impurity.\n\nIf a household is afflicted by recurrent deaths, spectral influxes, and bodily harm from punishments, invoke the *Qi*-Resolving Calamity-Averting Lord (*Yun Qi Jie E Jun*) with one hundred thousand troops to govern the matter. When a household suffers the lingering influxes of deceased parents, siblings, or spouses, which then afflict the living with bodily harm and lead to death, this must be addressed. According to the *One Thousand Two Hundred Officials*, there exists a *Qi*-Resolving Calamity-Averting Lord; here, the character for \"calamity\" is omitted, so it is not presumptuous to add it.\n\nThe *Rites* state: The *Qi*-Resolving Calamity-Averting Lord with one hundred thousand troops governs the capture of illness-causing ghosts, repelling and suppressing the destructive forces of the twelve punishments, the one hundred twenty spectral influxes, and other malevolent ghosts. There is also a *Qi*-Resolving Calamity-Averting Lord with five attendants who governs their capture and suppression.\n\nIf a household is haunted by the ghosts of the Five Tombs, causing harm and death to visitors, invoke the Supreme High Granary Lord (*Wu Shang Gao Cang Jun*) with one hundred thousand troops to capture and govern them. According to the *Tomb Records*, there are five types of burials—those by water, fire, weapons, concealment, or exposure—but these are not called the Five Tombs. Here, it likely refers to the Five Tombs of the Five Tones and Surnames. Some dead remain unburied, becoming malevolent spirits that bring misfortune, harm, and the extinction of descendants—these should be captured and governed.\n\nThe *Rites* state: The Supreme High Granary Lord with one hundred thousand troops governs the capture of ancestral ghosts of the Five Tombs that afflict descendants.\n\nIf a household suffers from recurrent influxes of water and fire, invoke the Supreme Heavenly Lord (*Wu Shang Tian Jun*) with one hundred thousand troops to sever them. When a household is plagued by the officials of water and fire, causing illnesses that lead to death—all stemming from the same source and spreading contagiously across generations without end—these must be severed.\n\nThe *Rites* state: The Supreme Heavenly Lord with one hundred thousand troops governs the capture of the one hundred twenty spectral influxes residing within the living, averting death and inviting life. It is also said: The Supreme Heavenly Lord of Life with one hundred thousand troops governs the capture of the one hundred twenty spectral influxes, as well as ghosts of harm, punishment, and execution. Some texts refer to the Supreme Heavenly Noble Lord or the Supreme Heavenly Peaceful Lord, but their governance is the same.\n\nTo break and dispel the ghosts and malevolent entities haunting ancestral halls, seats, and bedding, invoke the Heaven-Pacifying Lord (*Ping Tian Jun*) with one hundred twenty officials and generals to govern the Palace of Heavenly Prosperity and address the matter.\n\nThose who once followed heretical customs but now submit to the royal transformation should destroy and dismantle their ancestral halls and seats, abolishing all sacrificial and supplicatory rites. Yet afterward, if they suffer afflictions, misfortune, or illness due to lingering malevolence, or if their village or city harbors altars where shamans receive offerings, bringing harm to the people—\n\nThe *Rites* state: The Heaven-Pacifying Lord, with one hundred twenty officials and generals governing the Palace of Heavenly Prosperity, dispatches troops to seize the demonic spirits of the Five Prisons, the rebellious qi, and the ghosts of perverse offerings.\n\nThere are twenty-two such officials in total, all drawn from the *One Thousand Two Hundred Official Rites*, each with slightly differing duties. When submitting petitions, one should seek their aid from both sources.\n\nFor those who aspire to immortality yet suffer from chronic illness, persistent afflictions, or stagnation, invoke the Red-Clad Army of the Void-Pure Heavenly Essence Lord, one hundred thousand strong, stationed in the Palace of the Heavenly Pillar, to suppress ghosts, eradicate misfortune, and repel the qi of the Six Heavens.\n\nThose who wholeheartedly devote themselves to the pursuit of the Dao of immortality may find the numinous ghosts of the Six Heavens repeatedly assaulting them—bringing illness, imprisonment, or gradual impoverishment, often provoking misfortune. Thus, it is imperative to swiftly suppress and restrain them.\n\nIf a household is plagued by malevolent ghosts that refuse to disperse and continue to bring misfortune, invoke the Red Heavenly Lord of Qi-Consumption, with one hundred twenty officials and generals, to govern the matter. This refers to cases where, despite prior exorcisms, the evil spirits persist in their incursions, causing disasters and hauntings.\n\nIf a household experiences constant turmoil, chaotic nightmares, or the loss of soul and spirit, invoke the Luminous Lord of Spirit-Seizing, with one hundred twenty officials and generals, to govern the matter. When a family endures perpetual hardship, every action fraught with difficulty, dreams filled with ominous disturbances, and the mind and body unsettled—leading to gradual decline—this marks the onset of decay, and urgent intervention is required.\n\nThe *Rites* do not record the names or duties of these two lords; their inclusion here may stem from recent revelations by the Heavenly Master. They are equally essential—simply invoke them according to their designated roles. When submitting petitions, it is also advisable to draw from the corresponding officials in the *One Thousand Two Hundred Official Rites*, rather than relying solely on these twenty-five.\n\nThe above constitutes the oral instructions of the Orthodox Unity tradition, the essential teachings for curing illness and subduing ghosts, corresponding to the twenty-four spirits and the Three Palaces within the body. Though twenty-five official titles are listed here, the count of twenty-four spirits accounts for one official governing the obscure spirit of the root extremity, making the twenty-fifth. These spirits interact harmoniously, yet not all can be strictly aligned with the Three Palaces—they correspond instead to the Twenty-Four Spirits of the Eight Luminous Palaces, not the Three Ones.\n\nThe numbers of officials, generals, and soldiers arise from the Daoist tripartite qi responding to circumstances, not from beings born of Heaven and Earth. They coalesce from qi, assume form through symbolic representation, and manifest in response to invocation, lacking fixed substance. They are not beings conceived through mortal birth or attainable through ordinary Daoist practice. Their emergence stems from the profound sincerity that penetrates the void, shaping phenomena into tangible form—thus, qi is transformed into these officials and soldiers.\n\nThe qi of the Great Clarity responds boundlessly. Though one speaks of the Limitless Dao in its myriad layers, its limits remain unattainable. In summary, these manifestations interconnect, not existing in vain. While their principles can be grasped, they defy exhaustive description. The immortal and numinous officials and generals all belong to this category.\n\nThe remaining official titles are recorded in the *One Thousand Two Hundred Official Rites*, which are interlinked and supplementary. They do not align as distinctly with the twenty-four bodily spirits as these twenty-four titles do. The *One Thousand Two Hundred Official Rites* originated in Hanzhong and have circulated through the ages, accumulating variations over time. While some of these twenty-four titles may overlap with those in the *Rites*, the authenticity of this text remains unquestioned, having been recently revealed. Thus, not only those who recognize the true path should employ them—even the Alliance-Weapon Libationers must adhere to this method, though it lies beyond the comprehension of ordinary talent.\n\nIn urgent matters, invoke the appropriate officials as needed—their efficacy is immediate. They may be summoned through petition or by entering stillness, burning incense, and orally invoking the four directions. Earlier instructions specified facing east when making oral requests; here, invoking the four directions allows for flexibility. However, when composing petitions or following household rituals, one should still face east. After bowing and concluding the prayer, one may verbally plead for assistance.\n\nThe phrase \"corresponding to the twenty-four spirits within the body\" implies that these spirits resonate with every person, not just oneself. Unlike the method of spirit visualization, which cannot be performed for others, this approach allows even those in critical condition—such as the gravely ill or dying—to be aided by others. For all preceding matters, personal invocation is preferable. Petitions and oral requests may be made as circumstances permit. Written petitions cannot encompass every detail and are less effective than directly invoking the four directions. For grave matters, one should vow to offer specific items upon fulfillment, following the previously outlined methods.\n\nMatters not covered by the Great Clarity’s petitions or vows—those derived from authentic scriptures outside this framework—are governed by separate esoteric principles and cannot be lightly discussed. Such distinctions, though discussed in writing, are ultimately matters of inner realization.\n\nThe two morning audiences span ninety days. The later text states that the count begins from one’s *benming* day. For this method, one must retroactively determine the first *benming* day following birth, then count forward ninety days, marking each cycle. The current practice should commence at dawn on the *benming* day corresponding to this cycle.\n\nShould an individual be born on the thirtieth day of the fourth month in the *bingshen* year of the third *Xiaojian* reign of the Song (a *jiayin* day), the first *benming* day would fall on the thirteenth day of the sixth month, a *bingshen* day. The *bingshen* day of the thirteenth day of the eighth month, however, has already passed in void, no longer serving as the initial *benming* day. Each *bingshen* day recurs at sixty-day intervals; the present method spans ninety days, thus extending thirty days beyond this cycle. If one were to arbitrarily select a *bingshen* day as the starting point, mistakenly taking a void occurrence as the first, it would not be the true initial *benming* day. Such an error would lead to perpetual misalignment, causing no small harm.\n\nFrom the preceding *bingshen* day to the twenty-second day of the twelfth month in the *guiyou* year (a *bingshen* day), this marks the seventy-seventh cycle. Commencing the audience from this point, one counts forward ninety days to the dawn of the twenty-first day of the third month in the *jiaxu* year (a *bingyin* day) for the next audience. The following day, a *dingmao* day, begins the next count, culminating in another audience at dawn on the ninetieth day, a *bingshen* day. Thus, each *bingyin* day alternates with a *bingshen* day. If the audience is to span ninety days, one would instead use *yichou* and *yiwei* days.\n\nIn a single year, there may be three or four audiences, with no fixed number. Should one be unaware of the year and month of birth, the current year’s *benming* day may serve as the starting point.\n\nAt dawn, one enters stillness and burns incense before sunrise. This method requires quietude; thus, it is said that incense should first be burned during the morning audience in stillness. If incense has already been burned, it is now burned again while facing west. Since the present rite requires facing north, one must adjust the mechanism to face north directly and burn incense again, avoiding oblique placement beside the censer.\n\nFacing north, one offers audience to the Celestial Thearch of the Grand Tenuity. The count begins from the *benming* day.\n\nThis means that the first audience commences on the *benming* day, and after ninety days, the next audience follows. Once the incense is burned, one remains in prolonged kneeling, visualizing oneself suddenly beneath the Jade Tower of the Grand Tenuity, in the presence of the Celestial Thearch. There, one focuses the mind, regulates the *qi*, and offers the invocation:\n\nThe humble and lowly servant, so-and-so, respectfully bows twice and offers audience before the Jade Tower and Purple Palace of the Celestial Thearch of the Grand Tenuity. May so-and-so attain long life as a divine immortal, fulfill all desires, and accomplish every endeavor. May the Registrar of Destinies inscribe this on the Purple Tablet and record it in the Jade Emperor’s register, that I may become a paragon among beings.\n\nThe \"Registrar of Destinies\" mentioned here does not refer to the Registrars of the southern direction invoked in prior morning audiences but rather to the present overseer governing the Wu and Yue regions.\n\nUpon completion, one bows twice again.\n\nThen, the phrase \"thereafter bow twice again\" refers solely to this final prostration. After burning incense facing north, one simply kneels in reverence; upon completing the invocation, one bows twice more. When finished, one turns the incense burner to face west. Once the incense offering is fully concluded, two audiences should be held. At such times, two incense burners may be positioned, and there is no need to revert to the original arrangement.\n\nFirst, one must perform the audience in quiescence, then proceed with this rite. Both methods are termed \"entering quiescence,\" hence the instruction to perform the quiescent audience first. The present audience is of the highest order, yet it is said to precede the quiescent audience because one must ensure that the spirit attending the incense, who bears witness to one’s sincerity, presents one’s words truthfully before the Two Thearchs.\n\nThe method for the quiescent audience has not been detailed in extant texts; it follows the procedure described above. If practiced for eighteen years, the Celestial Tenuity will inscribe one’s name in the *Divine Record of Efficacy*, ensuring immortality—this is an esoteric method of the inner Dao. The audience before the Celestial Tenuity is the reason the Celestial Tenuity records one’s name.\n\nThe count of one hundred eighty-two days begins on the day of one’s birth within the birth month, referring to the numerical day within the lunar month, not the cyclical signs of *jia-yi* or *zi-chou*. One must consult the extended calendar, beginning the count from the day of birth and marking each one hundred eighty-two-day period as a single cycle. This count continues until the present year’s total is fulfilled; one may not simply take the current year’s birth month and day as the starting point.\n\nFor example, if one was born on the thirtieth day of the fourth month in the year *bing-shen*, counting one hundred eighty-two days brings one to the fourth day of the eleventh month, with the first audience occurring at midnight. By the present year, *gui-you*, the seventy-sixth audience would begin on the sixth day of the tenth month. The cyclical signs must be calculated with a consistent interval of one celestial stem between each audience; any error will lead to miscalculation. If the previous audience fell on *jia-zi*, the next should be on *bing-yin*, followed by *wu-chen*, and so on, ad infinitum.\n\nThe method for calculating these two audiences is derived from my own contemplation and reasoning; no scholar has yet grasped its subtleties. There exists another secret formula for determining the days, received through the profound decree of the Mysterious Principle, which cannot be disclosed here. A detailed discussion of this matter is contained in the third scroll.\n\nThe audience should take place at midnight, between the hours of *hai* and *zi*. Facing north, one burns incense and addresses the Supreme Jade Dawn Lord of the Dao. Kneeling, one offers the invocation, with all visualization practices resembling the previous method. Here, the phrase \"humble and lowly servant\" is omitted, as one dare not describe oneself with such self-deprecation before the Supreme High Sage.\n\nThe five characters \"Supreme High Sage Lord\" first invoke the title of the Supreme, then state the name, a mark of utmost reverence. The humble servant so-and-so respectfully bows twice beneath the Jasper Tower and offers this plea: may the Registrar of Destinies be commanded to inscribe my name in the register of long life, that all my aspirations and desires may be fulfilled, all things accomplished, and that I may ascend as a divine immortal, soaring freely to feast in the Nine Heavens.\n\nUpon completing the invocation, one bows twice more and withdraws. For both rites, one must fast and don proper attire for a full day beforehand. Whether in the world or in the mountains, one must first purify oneself for a day, bathing and donning fresh, clean garments.\n\nThe audience before the Supreme should begin on the day of one’s birth within the birth month, meaning one commences the rite at midnight on that day, with the calculation method as previously described. If one does not know the birth month or day, one may use the cyclical sign of the birth year as the starting day. For instance, if one’s birth year is *jia-zi*, the first audience occurs on *jia-zi*, and after one hundred eighty-two days, the next falls on *yi-chou*, followed by *ding-mao* after another count, and so on, always maintaining an interval of one celestial stem. If one does not know the birth year, one may begin on the first day of the first month.\n\nIf both birth details are unknown, there is no reliable standard; one may then take the current year in which the audience is to be performed and begin at midnight on the first day of the first month, counting one hundred eighty-two days to the second day of the seventh month, adjusting for the shorter months to complete the count. The next audience follows, and by tracking the cyclical signs, the sequence continues indefinitely. This method resembles the calendrical systems of the Xiongnu or foreign lands and may be used as a makeshift solution, though it falls far short of precise calculation.\n\nIf practiced for eighteen years, the Supreme will command the Registrar of Destinies to inscribe one’s name on the divine tablet, recording one’s attainment of long life. This audience before the Supreme is why the Supreme issues the command. Both methods require eighteen years of practice, placing them in the category of middle-grade scriptures. Through continuous practice, one will no longer suffer illness and will repel water, fire, and the five weapons.\n\nThis refers to the period after beginning these two audiences, when one gains the power to avert all calamities. If some practitioners remain vulnerable to misfortune, it is due to errors in their calculations, not adhering to the method described above. Consuming *qingjing* grain also prevents illness and disaster, aligning with these practices.\n\nThis is the esoteric method of the Eastern Flower Azure Palace, one of the various techniques for seeking immortality, though it is not practiced by those of that tradition. For those with ample resources, these two rites should be performed separately, entering quiescence and offering audience in dedicated attire, not to be mixed with other garments.\n\nFor all morning and evening audiences in quiescence, one should wear distinct clothing—this applies not only to these two rites. When studying in the mountains, one’s daily attire, including headscarves and coarse robes, may be worn for mundane tasks, but they are unsuitable for audiences with the loftiest perfected beings. One must prepare a separate set of garments. The phrase \"those with ample resources\" refers to the need for proper vestments, including outer and inner robes, skirts, and undergarments, all made specifically for these rites, not merely ritual robes. For those who cannot afford such provisions, garments should be laundered to ensure purity when the time comes.\n\nThe Perfected Lord of Pure Emptiness addressed the Lady, saying: The previous method was also taught by Lord Wang, a general explanation of the practices of the Eastern Palace, not a discussion confined to a single text or individual. The present instruction, however, is specifically intended to guide the Lady in her cultivation, hence the emphasis on the Pure Emptiness method.\n\nThese two practices are the esoteric methods to be followed in the world, for they repel all disasters. As the world is fraught with misfortunes, they are all the more worthy of practice. One does not cultivate the Dao yet attain it spontaneously; through diligent practice and the accumulation of years, one may ascend to immortality. Thus it is said.\n\nThe Lady, having received and applied these teachings, spoke this line herself in pure contemplation: since she dwelled in an age of chaos, traversing lands beset by war and banditry, she deemed the practices all the more necessary and thus embraced them at once. As for matters that might arise later, she would not be obliged to adhere to them strictly—hence this interjection was made.\n\nWhenever entering stillness, one must rinse the mouth with water to cleanse impure qi, for daily speech, laughter, idle chatter, or residual breath from food and drink are unfit to address the perfected spirits; thus, one must wash and purify through ablution. Upon exiting stillness, one must also rinse the mouth to seal the Three Palaces. When entering stillness to pray and bow before the deities of the Three Palaces, who assist in presenting one’s petitions, all such communications pass through the mouth. Once the ritual is complete, water is used to cleanse, allowing the spirits to return to their palaces and settle in tranquility. This water should be placed beside the door: upon first entering, one rinses before crossing the threshold, and upon retreating, one rinses before fully exiting.\n\nThe phrase \"each time one enters or exits\" refers specifically to occasions when one enters stillness to present petitions or perform morning and evening rites. For tasks such as sweeping or tidying, one need only rinse upon initial entry; no rinsing is required upon departure.\n\nWhen exiting the chamber of stillness, one must not look back, lest one offend the radiance of the perfected spirits and appear insincere. Having left the chamber and allowed the spirits to rest, to suddenly glance back would resemble prying or surveillance, thus offending the perfected and betraying reverence.\n\nIt is further stated that when burning incense, one must not look back, for in all human endeavors—whether mundane or esoteric—looking back is forbidden.\n\nUpon first entering the chamber of stillness, one must not summon outsiders or engage in extraneous speech, lest one violate the numinous qi and forfeit auspiciousness. Whenever entering stillness to burn incense, one must focus the mind upon the perfected spirits and harbor a sincere wish. To call out to others or entertain distracting thoughts would inwardly harm the abode of the spirit and outwardly disrupt the numinous order, inviting divine censure and summoning misfortune. The signs of auspiciousness would naturally recede.\n\nAll necessities for stillness should be prepared in advance; to lack them at the moment of need and then summon others is the mark of an unrefined practitioner, unworthy of consideration. Though these may seem minor matters, they demand utmost caution.\n\nThe five precepts above, though trifling in the context of the method, may bring no small calamity if neglected; thus, the practitioner is urged to observe these prohibitions carefully. While these instructions were conveyed by Lord Wang, they pertain to the household laws of the Great Clarity. Later Heavenly Masters did not expound upon them, as the Lady was already familiar with them.\n\nHere end the five transmitted precepts of the Wei tradition.\nThe *Hidden Instructions on Ascending to Perfection*, Scroll the Lower, concludes.\n\nThe character \"扶\" was originally mistakenly written as \"搏.\" Following this passage, there should be an omission.

      "translated_text": "**Esoteric Instructions for Ascending to Perfection**\n\n*Scripture Title:* *Esoteric Instructions for Ascending to Perfection*\nCompiled by Taoist Tao Hongjing of the Liang dynasty. A reverent collection of early Shangqing School methods and secret instructions for immortal ascension and perfection. The original text comprised twenty-four or twenty-five scrolls; only three fragmented scrolls remain.\n*Source of Base Text:* *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongxuan Section*, *Jade Instructions Category*.\n\n---\n\n**Esoteric Instructions for Ascending to Perfection, Scroll One**\nCompiled by Tao Hongjing, the Recluse of Huayang\nTransmitted by Lord Su, Minister of the Mystic Continent\n\nWithin the transmission are the practices of *guarding the One*, *curved fragmentation*, and *penetrating the cavernous depths*; the scripture contains the *Scripture of Flying Steps*, though portions are truncated or lost. All these are difficult for practitioners, so I have added detailed annotations to dispel doubts and obstructions.\n\n### **True Talismans**\nThe *True Talisman of the Supreme Ultimate Emperor Lord* refers to the four talismanic chapters, all invoking the *Supreme Ultimate Emperor Lord*—the Celestial Emperor of the Supreme Ultimate, the first teacher of the *Three Ones* received by the Golden Portal Sage Lord upon beginning the Dao.\n\n- *Six Talismans of the Upper Prime*\n- *Five Talismans of the Middle Prime*\n- *Five Talismans of the Lower Prime*\n\nThe *Three Primes* denote the three palaces within the body, each generating its own talismanic script.\n\nThe talismans were obtained by Master Juan upon splitting open a carp, as the Most High summoned the *Three Ones* to guard the form. Using the talisman to summon the One commands it to guard the body, much like the *Purple Script* summons the *Three Hun*.\n\nThe eight solar terms—*Beginning of Spring, Spring Equinox, Beginning of Summer, Summer Solstice, Beginning of Autumn, Autumn Equinox, Beginning of Winter, Winter Solstice*—mark the starting days. Each of these eight nodal days serves as a beginning.\n\nWrite in cinnabar, face the *wang* direction at dawn, and swallow one talisman. After completion, bow twice and recite prayers as you wish.\n\nOn the dawn of the *Beginning of Spring*, facing *yin*, write in cinnabar on white paper, beginning with the first talisman of the *Upper Prime*. Hold it in the left hand, recite the prayer, then ingest it. After ingestion, bow twice. Alternatively, draw all sixteen talismans, cut them out, and ingest one each dawn. When ingesting the *Upper Prime* talismans, visualize them entering the *Upper Palace*, with the *Upper One* receiving them. The *Middle Prime* and *Lower Prime* follow likewise.\n\nWhen writing and ingesting talismans, first burn incense to the left. Many scriptures prescribe prayer texts for talisman ingestion, but here it is said to recite as one wishes—no fixed formula is required. One may also compose four-character rhymed verses to invoke the intent of summoning; a ready-made version exists separately.\n\nWear the talisman on the head, encased in a brocade pouch. Do not tread upon filth. After five years, you will meet the *True One*.\n\nFor talisman-wearing, begin on the dawn of the *Beginning of Spring*. After drawing the talisman but before ingestion, write the *Three Prime Talismans* again in cinnabar on white silk, cut them into three pieces, hold them all while reciting the prayer, then roll and place them into a purple brocade pouch to wear on the head. Only then ingest one paper talisman. This single act of writing and wearing on the *Beginning of Spring* suffices for the meeting; no repetition is needed for other terms—only the written ingestion must be renewed.\n\nIngestion of talismans begins on the eight nodal days and ends on the sixteenth day. For subsequent terms, resume ingestion as before. Each term’s ingestion begins at dawn, with one talisman as the starting point, totaling sixteen talismans—ingestion ceases upon completion. Each term spans forty-five days, each *qi* phase fifteen days; thus, talisman ingestion aligns with the *qi* days of the term.\n\nIn the sixth month, when visualizing the *Middle Dipper*, one cannot refrain from talisman ingestion. The mention of only eight terms here parallels the later reference to four terms sharing a single prayer matter—implying talisman ingestion is still necessary, merely avoiding overlap with the *Summer Solstice* and *Beginning of Autumn*.\n\n### **Precious Chapters**\nThe *Precious Chapter of the Supreme Ultimate Emperor Lord* was conferred upon Master Juan by the *Azure Lad of the Eastern Sea* to seal the names of sacred mountains. Like the talismans, it was obtained from splitting open a carp, though this was already mentioned in the previous section.\n\nWrite in cinnabar on silk and wear it on the left elbow. Avoid contact with filth. After eight years, the *Three Ones* will all appear.\n\nAfter completing the ingestion and wearing of the *Three Prime Talismans* on white silk, face north and write again on white silk, matching the length and width of gold foil. Hold it in the left hand and recite a prayer as you wish. After the prayer, roll it into a purple brocade pouch and wear it on the left elbow—this too leads to the meeting.\n\nIf the *Beginning of Spring* falls in the twelfth month of the previous year, write and wear the talisman on that day, then renew ingestion on the first day of the first month.\n\nWhen wearing this *Chapter-Talisman*, avoid treading upon filth. For convenience in movement or to prevent forgetfulness, one may wear it while *guarding the One*, then remove and store it among bedding or utensils after the practice.\n\nThe statement that the *Three Ones* all appear after eight years contrasts with the earlier claim of meeting the *True One* in five years—indicating not all are seen at once. The phrase \"meeting the One\" does not refer solely to the *Three Ones* within one’s body but also to the *Three One Emperor Lords* of the *Supreme Tenuity* descending to meet the practitioner. The same applies to those who transmit scriptures. Thus, one must first accumulate diligent practice to evoke their presence.\n\nOn the dawn of the first day of the first month, write one talisman in azure ink—this too is a *Precious Chapter*. Once ingested, it is called a talisman; when engraved on metal and worn, it becomes a *chapter*. The *chapter* resembles a seal, with fixed dimensions that must not be diminished. The talisman is like an imperial edict, its size unbounded; here, it is made small and narrow, smaller than the *chapter*.\n\nIngest one each year on the dawn of the first day, ceasing only upon meeting the One. Use fine *kongqing* or *cengqing* pigments, grind them finely, soak to remove metallic impurities, then mix with glue and write thinly on white paper—avoid thickness. *Daiqing* may also be used.\n\nFace north, bow twice, and ingest. After writing while facing north, hold the talisman in the left hand, recite the prayer, bow twice again, then ingest. Visualize it entering the *Upper Palace*. All talisman ingestions to summon and notify the body’s spirits require bowing; notifications to external spirits do not—this is the general rule.\n\nAfter meeting the *Three Ones*, use gold as the medium, nine inches long, four inches wide, and three *fen* thick, to inscribe it.",

      "translated_text": "The gold used must be yellow gold, with *quality* referring to the base material for carving. Following this method would require tens of *jin* of gold, which is beyond a Daoist’s means. Silver may also be used—silver being *white gold*—and since it is simply called *gold*, it serves both purposes. Carve the text in intaglio like a seal, all in reverse script. Use ancient measurements for length and width to seal and command the malevolent spirits of mountains and rivers, as well as the true essences of the Five Peaks.\n\nThe sequence of seasonal regulations will be personally instructed by the *True One of the Three Origins*. The method of sealing and commanding is intended for summoning and dispatching spirits, but its full procedures remain undisclosed. One must first meet the *Three Ones* before receiving these teachings. This is recorded in the *Supreme Scripture of Primordial Numinosity*.\n\nThis true scripture has not circulated in the world; it is the foundational teaching of *guarding the One*.\n\n---\n\n**The Nine Palaces**\nThe head contains nine palaces. Let us first describe them, arranging their domains before detailing their cultivation and use.\n\nThree *fen* above and between the eyebrows, receding inward, lies the *Shoucun Double Fields*, directly above the nose and aligned with the upper edge of the brows, spanning one *cun* square. *Receding* means moving backward, with the boundary set at the bone. The three *fen* within the bone form the domain of *Shoucun*, encompassing the *Terrace* and *Gate Towers*. The *Hall of Brightness* occupies only seven *fen* of this space. Since both fields share a single *cun* and stand side by side, they are called the *Shoucun Double Fields*. On the left resides the *Azure Chamber*, and on the right, the *Purple Portal*, where two spirits dwell.\n\nOne *cun* inward lies the *Hall of Brightness Palace*, where the *Luminous Youthful True Lord* resides on the left, the *Luminous Maiden True Lord* on the right, and the *Mirror Spirit Lord* in the center—three spirits in all.\n\nTwo *cun* inward lies the *Cavern Chamber Palace*. Though the entire head is called the *Cavern Chamber*, this is its true location. On the left dwells the *Lord of Non-Flourishing*, on the right the *Lord of White Origin*, and in the center the *Yellow Old Lord*—three spirits in all.\n\n*Note: From this point onward, \"one cun inward,\" \"two cun inward,\" and \"three cun inward\" all continue from the brows as the baseline, not from the three-fen mark. Some claim that only after entering three fen does one reach Shoucun, and only after one cun does one reach the Hall of Brightness—how could this be so? The following example serves as proof.*\n\nAccording to the *Method of the Five Celestial Bodies*: The *Star of Stability* resides in the *Yellow Chamber of the Long Valley*, which lies in the human center. Precisely two *fen* inward, the star appears suspended above, its size exceeding the chamber, thus protruding slightly beyond the skin. If the chamber were only reached after two *fen*, how could the star extend outward? It is also said that one *cun* inward spans one *cun* square, further clarifying this.\n\nMoreover, this scripture states that one *cun* above the *Hall of Brightness* is the *Celestial Court Palace*—would there be an empty *cun* above it? Two *cun* above the *Hall of Brightness* is the *Mysterious Palace of the Imperial Realm*, where the *Star of Longevity* resides. These examples serve as clear evidence. Those who can perceive the true palaces will recognize the truth of these words.\n\nThree *cun* inward lies the *Cinnabar Field Palace*, also called the *Mud Pill Palace*. On the left dwells the *Supreme Crimson Child Emperor Lord*, and on the right, the *Imperial Minister*—two spirits in all.\n\nFour *cun* inward lies the *Flowing Pearl Palace*, where the *Flowing Pearl True Spirit* resides.\n\nFive *cun* inward lies the *Jade Emperor Palace*, where the *Jade Clarity Divine Mother* dwells.\n\nOne *cun* above the *Hall of Brightness* is the *Celestial Court Palace*. This is measured one *cun* outward from the *Hall of Brightness*, not necessarily aligned with its exact *cun*. Since the human forehead protrudes, the palace extends three *fen* beyond the *Cavern Chamber* above, with its front entrance and exit aligned like the central space of *Shoucun* below. Here resides the *Upper Clarity True Maiden*.\n\nOne *cun* above the *Cavern Chamber* is the *Utmost True Palace*, two *cun* inward in total. Here dwells the *Supreme Ultimate Imperial Consort*.\n\nOne *cun* above the *Cinnabar Field* is the *Mysterious Cinnabar Palace*, three *cun* inward in total. Also called the *Mysterious Cinnabar Brain Essence Mud Pill Mysterious Palace*, it houses the *Central Yellow Supreme One True Lord*.\n\nOne *cun* above the *Flowing Pearl* is the *Supreme August Palace*, four *cun* inward in total. Here dwells the *Supreme Lord Empress*.\n\nThese are the nine palaces of the head. The latter eight palaces each span one *cun* square, while only the *Hall of Brightness* and *Shoucun* share a single *cun* square. *Shoucun* is not a separate palace but serves as the *Terrace* and *Gate Towers* outside the *Hall of Brightness*. Within the *Hall of Brightness*, the upper and lower edges each span one *cun*, though the north-south dimension is shallower, only seven *fen*.\n\nThough these nine palaces occupy the same head, their ranks differ in elevation. The first is the *Jade Emperor Palace*, followed by the *Supreme August Palace*, the *Celestial Court Palace*, the *Utmost True Palace*, the *Mysterious Cinnabar Palace*, the *Cavern Chamber Palace*, the *Flowing Pearl Palace*, the *Cinnabar Field Palace*, and finally the *Hall of Brightness Palace*—this is the order of their precedence.\n\nThe scriptures of the *Hall of Brightness*, *Cavern Chamber*, *Cinnabar Field*, and *Flowing Pearl* palaces contain the Way of immortals for true persons and have been transmitted in the world. However, the current *Hall of Brightness* scripture only includes visualization practices, with no invocatory methods—it appears incomplete. The *Cavern Chamber* refers to the *Inner Scripture of the Cavern Chamber* now in circulation, which contains only a single recitation without any visualization or application. Though its Way has spread, the true original is unseen.\n\nThe *Cinnabar Field Scripture* is the Way of *guarding the Three Origins True One*, its roots in the *Primordial Numinosity*. Its methods are fully preserved here, with nothing lacking. The *Flowing Pearl Scripture* is practiced by the *Supreme Ultimate Duke*, the *Minister of Destiny*, and the *Central Lord* and *Lesser Lord*, who may also receive it. Though said to be transmitted, it has never been seen in the world. Thus, the *Central Lord* said: *\"Only those who toil tirelessly shall I grant the Flowing Pearl Truth.\"* This is the supreme Way of the *Central Truth*, though these words seem addressed to a guest, and it remains unclear whether it was ever received.",

      "translated_text": "The *Mysterious Cinnabar Palace Scripture* likewise contains the essential teachings of the *True Officials* and the *Minister of Destiny*, serving as the guiding principle of the Four Palaces. This scripture must be bestowed by the *Supreme Ultimate Emperor Lord*, and it is only occasionally transmitted. The *Mysterious Cinnabar Scripture* refers to the practice following the *Three Ones*; its origins also trace back to the *Primordial Numinosity*. Though this Way is profound and wondrous, and though it shares a scroll with the *Three Origins*, it was in fact the final practice of Master Su, through which he attained the rank of *True Minister*. Thus, Master Ziyang compiled its methods and transmitted them afterward—it was never originally part of the same scripture. As their pledges and covenants differ in rank, at the time of transmission, one need not receive the *Three Ones* together with it. Yet the *Mysterious Cinnabar Scripture* states: *\"Only after dawn and dusk guarding the various Three Ones is complete may one proceed to the next stage.\"* This implies that practitioners of the *Mysterious Cinnabar* may first guard the One, while those who guard the One need not know of the *Mysterious Cinnabar*.\n\nWhen the Ways of the Five Palaces circulate in the world, those with true names may encounter them. Yet without the destined bone and fate, one shall not hear of these teachings. Many in the world receive these methods, but none cultivate and guard them. The deities within the body in this practice differ from those in other methods; they are treasured and concealed by the *Upper Perfected*, and the practice itself is sufficient for one’s work. If one cultivates this Way, one attains long life; if one does not, one dies. Yet this is not a matter of destined bone alone.\n\nThere is also the *Jade Emperor Palace*, where the *Jade Clarity Divine Mother* resides; the *Celestial Court Palace*, where the *Upper Clarity True Woman* dwells; the *True Ultimate Palace*, where the *Supreme Ultimate Empress* abides; and previously, it was called *Ultimate Truth*, but here it is named *True Ultimate*—the order of these two characters remains unclear, and it is feared that a later error may have occurred. There is also the *Grand Sovereign Palace*, where the *Supreme Lord’s Queen* resides. These Four Palaces all pertain to the *Feminine True One*, and their Way is higher than that of the *Masculine True One*. Each has its own precious scriptures, transmitted only to those who have already attained *Perfected* rank; those who have not yet achieved *Perfection* shall not hear of them, and their essentials of the *Feminine True* are likewise not bestowed.\n\nThe deities of the previous Five Palaces are all male, hence called the *Masculine One*; the deities of these Four Palaces are all female, hence called the *Feminine One*. Among the Nine Palaces of the *Upper Clarity* and *Great Tenuity*, *True Lords* reside, and thus corresponding positions are established in the human head to align with them. It is said: *\"In emptiness and harmony, guard the Masculine; in solitude and stillness, guard the Feminine.\"* *\"Solitude and stillness\"* refers to solitary wandering in simplicity. Though one may not yet have attained *Perfection* in worldly study, if the mind remains turbid and obstructed, one cannot cultivate this Way. The *Five Thousand Characters* also speak of *\"knowing the Masculine, guarding the Feminine.\"*\n\nThese Four Palaces exist within all people, but those who do not cultivate this Way leave their palaces empty. Those who do not fully cultivate the Nine Palaces likewise leave their palaces empty—not only the Four Palaces of the *Feminine*. Within the *Cinnabar Field Palace*, the *Emperor Lord* is always present; within the *Inch of Guarding*, great deities constantly reside. One need not wait to guard them to find them already in their palaces. Those who cultivate become *Immortals*; those who do not die at the end of their allotted years. Thus, even in the bodies of the vulgar and common, the *Three Ones* are always present. Yet if one cannot cultivate and guard them, when one’s lifespan ends, they depart, and death follows. If the methods one has received are constantly cultivated and preserved, then deities will also enter the empty palaces in accordance with the practice—not only the *Emperor Lord* in the *Cinnabar Field*.\n\n*\"Guard the One without fail, and when the limit of one’s lifespan passes, there shall be no further death. Until the time of meeting, when meeting occurs, one attains the Dao.\"* The deities of the *Masculine* and *Feminine Ones* may be cultivated together by both men and women without distinction. Only through utmost dedication and perseverance shall one gain benefit. This refers to the *Masculine* and *Feminine Ones*: both men and women may cultivate them together, without distinguishing between male and female. If a man guards the *Feminine*, he assumes a feminine form; if a woman guards the *Masculine*, she takes on a masculine appearance. However, the *Three Ministers* are formed from the essence of one’s own body, and thus one should follow one’s original nature and distinguish between male and female.\n\nThe principle of *guarding the One* first requires one or two years of focused and arduous contemplation, until one attains a semblance of realization, making visualization easier. *Guarding the Inch* is the initial method of *guarding the One*. Examining the prefaces and sequences in the scriptures, the order is not always consistent, with some sections initially undivided, others surpassing conventional usage. One cannot transcribe them strictly according to their original presentation. Here, I have arranged and connected them in proper sequence, extracting their essentials and sources. The large characters are all from the original text, without addition or omission; I have merely organized their threads to allow for orderly reference.\n\nOn the night of *Beginning of Spring*, at midnight, sit facing east. The scripture later states: on *Beginning of Summer*, face south; on *Beginning of Autumn*, face west; on *Beginning of Winter*, face north. The method states: this is the practice of *guarding the Three Origins True One*, all using the nights of the four *Beginnings* (of the seasons). After the *Hai* hour (9–11 p.m.), one may proceed, facing the *Monthly Establishment*. The four *Beginnings* correspond to the four *First Months* of the seasons, not the cardinal directions; the *Five Dippers* divide the *Solstices* and *Equinoxes*, which are the four *Middle Months*.\n\nSit evenly, hold the breath, close the eyes, clench the fists, and place them on the knees. First, visualize *guarding the Inch* according to the method. Above the space between the eyebrows, within, there is the *Yellow Gate*, *Purple Chamber*, *Crimson Terrace*, and *Azure House*, all together forming the domain of *guarding the Inch*. Behind the ears, this is the region three *fen* inward. The *Terrace* and *Gate* lie within these three *fen*, with a width of one *cun* on each side, each three *fen* square, leaving a central opening of four *fen* as a path, internally connecting to the *Hall of Light* and ascending to the front gate of the *Celestial Court*.\n\nOn the left side of *guarding the Inch* is the *Crimson Terrace*. The terrace’s form resembles a square tower beside a city gate, with its exterior and upper and lower parts all made of red jade. In the center of the tower’s upper section is a window, with curtains and hangings all in azure, and the deity resides within. On the right side is the *Yellow Gate*. The gate’s form is similar to the terrace, also square and open externally, made of yellow jade. In the center of the gate’s upper section is a window, with curtains and hangings all in purple, and the deity resides within.",

This is merely an explanation, not a matter of meditative visualization.\n\nThe paths by which the Perfected Spirits of the Nine Palaces enter and exit the head—though there be the Celestial Sovereign’s trusted mandate without, they may not approach directly.

      "translated_text": "Within these two spirits also reside the qi of wind and clouds, resplendent in guarding the *cun*-realm of the chamber.\n\nWhen retiring at dusk or engaging in visualization, if one focuses solely on the Nine Palaces in the evening, one should first lie down and visualize accordingly. If it is a night designated for guarding the Nine Palaces, upon nearing the time of visualization, one must first attend to this. Begin by visualizing the two great spirits as if they are present before you. Hold the breath and visualize them in their full form as described earlier. Once they appear within their chambers, it will be as though you see them with your own eyes. Then, call their names and styles three times, intoning at the heart:\n\n*Purple Door Great Spirit, named Tranquil Leveling, styled Dharma King—two, two, two, two; Azure Chamber Great Spirit, named Upright Heart, styled Precise Square—two, two, two, two.*\n\nThereafter, regulate the breath and softly intone the incantation:\n\n*Purple Door, Azure Chamber,\nTwo great spirits stand,\nHands grasp flowing bells,\nBodies birth wind and clouds.\nThey escort and guard the true Dao,\nBar entry to all without.\nLet my thoughts and perceptions\nPierce through the numinous gates,\nExiting and entering with upright harmony,\nAscending through the Nine Portals,\nTo behold the Nine Perfected,\nThe honored of the Supreme High—six verses.*\n\nOnce the incantation is complete, proceed to visualize the Three Ones, the Cavern Chamber, the Nine Paths, and all essential Dao-paths. The Nine Paths are the paths of the Nine Palaces.\n\nAll who practice visualization of the Bright Hall, Cavern Chamber, or Mysterious Cinnabar alone must first perform this visualization and incantation. The marvel of the Feminine One also follows this method.\n\nWithin the Nine Palaces of the head, if there are two spirits, the left is superior, followed by the right. If there are three spirits, the center is superior, followed by the left, then the right. At the outset of visualization practice, one must begin from the lower regions. Thus, when guarding the *cun*-realm, one first attends to the Purple Door; when visualizing the Cavern Chamber, one first attends to White Prime; and when visualizing the Bright Hall, one begins with the left—this follows the principle that the feminine is esteemed above the masculine. Only the Cinnabar Field and Imperial Homeland are transformations of the essence within one’s own body, not ranks of external origin, and thus are visualized last. If the upper palace is not located below the body, then the left is superior, followed by the center, then the right.\n\n**Bright Hall**\nAfter completing the visualization of the *cun*-realm, proceed to this. If one does not practice the Guarding of the One, using this method alone is also excellent. If one primarily guards the One, omitting this is not amiss, though practicing both is even better.\n\nOn the left resides the Bright Youth Perfected Lord, whose tabooed name is Mysterious Yang and whose style is Lesser Azure. Visualize him in male form. On the right resides the Bright Maiden Perfected Lord, whose tabooed name is Subtle Yin and whose style is Lesser Prime. Visualize her in female form. In the center resides the Bright Mirror Spirit Lord, whose tabooed name is Illuminating Essence and whose style is Fourfold Clarity. Visualize him also in male form. These three lords jointly govern the Bright Hall Palace. All wear brocade robes of green, with belts adorned with four jade bells, and hold in their mouths a red jade mirror. Both the mirrors and bells are red. Their attire is uniformly green brocade robes, with belts bearing four red jade bells—one each at front, back, left, and right—and they hold in their mouths the nose of the red jade mirror, its surface facing outward. Though the bells and mirrors have substance, their red glow illuminates all, their brilliance resounding and reverberating through the Nine Palaces. Their heads resemble those of infants, as do their forms, and they sit facing outward or toward one another. All appear as newborns, with golden radiance and jade-like complexions. By day, the three face outward; by night, the left and right turn toward the center. Such is the Dao of the Bright Hall.\n\nIf one practices the Guarding of the One followed by the visualization of the Bright Hall, at this point call out the titles and names of each three times:\n\n*Bright Youth Perfected Lord, whose tabooed name is Mysterious Yang, styled Lesser Azure—two, two, two, two;\nBright Maiden Perfected Lord, whose tabooed name is Subtle Yin, styled Lesser Prime—two, two, two, two;\nBright Mirror Spirit Lord, whose tabooed name is Illuminating Essence, styled Fourfold Clarity—two, two, two, two.*\n\nThen, click the teeth nine times and cease, proceeding next to visualize the Cavern Chamber. If one is not practicing the Guarding of the One and intends to perform only the subsequent methods, one must first visualize thus, completing it before proceeding to the remaining practices.\n\nIf a Daoist—here referring to one who cultivates the Dao—fears or dreads anything, such as dwelling alone in the mountains and encountering malevolent spirits or disturbances of the heart, or experiencing tremors of apprehension, one should employ this method. Visualize the three spirits, causing them to ring their jade bells, so that the sound reaches the Great Ultimate. Visualize the three spirits each shaking the bells at their waists, the four bells, so that the ears perceive their sound, resounding and reverberating through the Celestial Palace of the Great Ultimate. Visualize them exhaling the red glow of their jade mirrors, extending ten thousand *zhang*, also perceiving the light of the mirrors emanating from the *cun*-realm, illuminating the four directions in a circle of fifty *li*, one hundred sixty-six *bu*, and four *chi*. One should first pace the perimeter of one’s dwelling, marking the boundaries to a specific mountain, village, or domain, so that when visualizing the light, it naturally extends to this limit, making the practice easier. Every matter requires such precision, not merely this one method.\n\nOnce the visualization is complete, call the names and titles of the three lords three times, clicking the teeth nine times. Then, a thousand demons will be subdued, and ten thousand ghosts will vanish. After completing the visualization, call their names and titles in sequence as before.\n\nThis section describes the method for repelling evil spirits and myriad demons.\n\nIf a Daoist experiences thirst—here referring to thirst for drink, though it may also denote hunger and thirst—visualize the three lords exhaling red qi into one’s mouth, which one then inhales and swallows, soon feeling sated. One should visualize them exhaling red qi from the *cun*-realm, which descends thickly into one’s mouth. One then inhales and swallows it repeatedly, until fully sated. This is the method for alleviating hunger and thirst.\n\nIf a Daoist travels at night and cannot see the path, again visualize the three lords, continuing from the previous methods. Cause them to exhale three beams of fiery light to illuminate the way ahead, and soon the path will become bright and clear. Each should exhale a red glow, like a flame, emerging from the *cun*-realm and extending far ahead to illuminate the surroundings. Visualize this as vividly as if seen with the eyes, and the path will become bright. Proceed while maintaining the visualization, without pause. This is the method for illuminating darkness.",

      "translated_text": "If one finds oneself in perilous circumstances—amidst treacherous terrain, the chaos of armed conflict, or when neither concealment nor flight to desolate lands can avert worldly dangers—should sudden crisis strike and no means of warding or defense remain, this method is revealed. Even those among the laity who are devout may practice it, for it is not reserved solely for Daoists.\n\nIn haste, visualize the Three Lords and cause them to sound jade bells. Focus intently and imagine each Lord brandishing four bells, shaking forth beams of crimson mirror-light to strike and repel enemies or malevolent forces. Upon encountering this radiance, their armor shall falter, and they will collapse at once. The adversaries, stricken with terror, will no longer harbor thoughts of harm—*harm* here meaning violent seizure, though it may also be read as *injury*. This is the method for repelling evil and danger.\n\nIf a Daoist seeks to prolong life and escape death, or when illness strikes and deliverance is sought, one should lie down properly, supine with fists clenched, hold the breath, close the eyes, and settle the mind. First, faintly visualize the sun and moon within the Hall of Light, the sun to the left and the moon to the right. Then, as in the previous methods, visualize the Three Lords. Within the Hall of Light, the Three Lords should be seen kneeling upright and facing outward—even at night, they must be visualized as facing outward. Though the body lies prone, the spirits follow its repose yet remain in the posture of long kneeling, as if standing. For while the gods within the body may recline, the visualization here must remain clear, just as the *cun*-realm’s terrace and watchtower admit no turning aside. Thus, though they align with the body’s position, they must be imagined as seated.\n\nExhale red qi, causing its light to envelop the body in a full circuit. Each Lord emits beams of crimson mirror-light from the *cun*-realm, gradually encircling the body. Near the mouth, swallow the red qi repeatedly, without limit. With eyes closed, gently draw in the encircling red qi and swallow it, sensing its vigorous descent into the mouth and onward through the chest and abdomen. Soon, the red qi encircling the body transforms into fire, which then burns the body until flesh and flame become one, radiating luminous brilliance within and without. This continues for a long while, resembling the method of restraining the hun-soul, as the fire thoroughly scorches the body’s exterior and interior, bones and flesh, until they glow like burning charcoal. This is called the *Refining of the Form through Sun and Moon*, whereby the dead are revived.\n\nWhen illness first strikes, this method should be employed to cure it. If one waits until the affliction has grown severe, the visualization may no longer be precise, so practice it at the first sign of discomfort. This is the Way to heal sickness and dispel illness, and there is no fixed time for its practice. If performed every evening before sleep, it will assuredly grant long life and prevent death. For though it is not a lofty method—merely ensuring immortality—it remains a minor Way worthy of attention. This is also the method for cultivating longevity through concurrent practice, a common technique among those who tend the Hall of Light.\n\nFurthermore, by frequently visualizing and swallowing red qi, one’s complexion will revert to youth, becoming like that of a child. This is the Way to avoid death. Even when not treating illness or engaging in evening visualization, one should regularly visualize and swallow red qi, imagining the Three Lords exhaling it from the *cun*-realm into one’s mouth before swallowing. This is the Way to return to youth.\n\nHerein lie the essentials of the Bright and Constant Way.",

      "translated_text": "Herein lie the seven essentials of the Hall of Light, encompassing all methods in their entirety. Only the matter of unspoken invocations remains—though by the standards of the Constant and True Way, this too belongs to the Hall of Light’s tradition, the visualization of invocations is particularly intricate. It is feared that the Hall of Light may possess other grand scriptures, and what is transmitted here is but an abridged excerpt.\n\nEach morning upon rising, one should swallow saliva thirty times, then wipe the face and massage the eyes as a regular practice, visualizing the saliva as crimson fluid. This single method may yet serve as a complement to the Hall of Light’s practices.\n\nThe phrase \"in all cases\" indicates that those who practice the Hall of Light’s method for extending life should perform this daily without fail. It may also be employed by those who cultivate the *shouyi* (Guardian of Unity) tradition, for though these are two distinct methods, they converge in a single practice.\n\nThe *Dongfang* (Cavern Chamber) must also be cultivated in tandem. Proceeding from the *cun*-realm and the Hall of Light, one then enters the *Dongfang* to reach the *Dantian* (Cinnabar Field). Thus, it is fitting to practice both together, without omitting any stage in between.\n\nWithin the *Dongfang* lie the Yellow Gate, the Purple Portal, and the Chamber of Mysterious Essence—abodes where the Three Ones, the Venerable Lords, perpetually reside. These Yellow Gate and Purple Portal are not the same as those in the *cun*-realm but exist separately within the *Dongfang* Palace, akin to the Mysterious Elixir’s Purple Chamber and Verdant Chamber.\n\nThe Supreme Lord of the Upper One occasionally enters this realm, where the Jade Scriptures are stored. The Middle and Lower Ones are not permitted to wander here. When referring to the Three Ones, this is a general designation, and the title \"Venerable Lord\" applies only to the Supreme Lord as the most exalted of the Three.\n\nThose who practice both methods together will perceive the deities more swiftly, for the more one visualizes, the quicker the resonance. The *Dongfang* adept must take *shouyi* as their foundation, progressing from external to internal, from beginning to end, for the root of all cultivation arises from the One.\n\nThe *shouyi* adept must take the *Dongfang* as their canopy of radiance, its luminous majesty sheltering and perfecting their Way. Thus, the Three Ones and the *Dongfang* are interdependent: though their dwellings differ, those who attain the Way must harmonize their practice.\n\nThe Way of the Nine Palaces employs each palace individually, yet in concurrent cultivation, the more one engages, the greater the benefit. Though their principles differ, they do not obstruct one another. The difficulty lies in the scarcity of accessible scriptures and the ease with which sincerity wanes, which is why scholars, though numerous, have scarcely grasped even a fraction of its essence.\n\nWithin the *Dongfang* reside three perfected beings: on the left, the Lordless Lad; on the right, the White Prime Lord; and in the center, the Yellow Elder Lord. Together, they govern the *Dongfang*, and this is the Way of Ascending Perfection, which has its own separate scriptures.\n\nThese three perfected beings are the constant deities of the *Dongfang*, while the Nine Perfected are transient manifestations. They separate and reunite the White Prime and the Lordless Lad, coalescing into a single perfected being. Moreover, the White Prime resides in the lungs and does not enter the *Dongfang*. Thus, according to the Jade Scriptures, only the Yellow Elder Lord remains.\n\n*Dengzhen Yinjue*, Scroll the Upper, concludes.\n*(Note: The character 「曰」 above appears to mark a possible lacuna.)*\n*Dengzhen Yinjue*, Scroll the Middle.",

Only after midnight, upon waking, should one sit up to perform it. Before midday, it may be repeated and recited several times—but one must consider facing east, which does not change with the four seasons.\n\nPress the fleshy part behind the thumbs of both hands against the eyes and wipe toward the ear openings, so that the two palms meet at the nape of the neck, repeating this twenty-seven times. Begin near the back of the palms, starting from the edge of the thumbs, first lightly pressing the eyes (as the scripture says), then wipe each eye left and right, passing over the ear openings and crossing at the back of the neck. Alternate thus, stopping only after twenty-seven repetitions.\n\nVisualize within each eye the emanation of three colored *qi*—purple, azure, and crimson—before you. This is the internal pressing of the Three Primordial Clouds to irrigate and unite the pupils. While pressing, imagine the three colored clouds glowing luxuriantly, each rising above the face. After twenty-seven repetitions, pause briefly, then guide the three *qi* with focused intent, causing their radiance to bathe the eye pupils before repeating the practice.\n\nRecite the following incantation:\n*\"Pupils of triple clouds, true lords of both eyes,\nBrilliant and luminous, they infuse essence and open the pure spirit.\nGrand Mystery’s cloudy forms, numinous and graceful,\nGuard the paired gates and unseal the nine portals.\nAll joints respond in harmony, morning fluids ascend to the Mud Pill,\nThe body ascends to the Jade Palace, ranked among the perfected of the highest order.\"*\n(Comprising six rhyming couplets.)\n\nAfter reciting, swallow saliva fifty times, then open the eyes. This may be practiced upon sitting up and need not be confined to night—though it should be done at the time when *qi* is generated. After a year, the ears and eyes will become sharp and clear. With prolonged practice, one may see a thousand *li* afar, perceive the reflections of spirits, and hear sounds beyond ordinary hearing. This is not merely a method for brightening the eyes and opening the ears but a lofty Dao of true immortals. The immortals of Canglang Fangzhang often treasure and practice it.\n\nThis method originates from the *Scripture of the Four Luminaries of the Supreme* and is transmitted only after swearing an oath with gold and blue-green silk. Among all methods for the ears and eyes, none surpasses this one, hence the establishment of a covenant for its transmission. All practices involving cultivation, visualization, and recitation should likewise be pledged to a profound master—without such an oath, there will be no efficacy. The quantity of gold and silk is left to the practitioner’s discretion.\n\n**Yunlin’s Instruction to Yang Shu**\n\nOn the face, one should often rub both hands until warm, following the contours closely and thoroughly. First, rub the palms together until hot, then use them to wipe the face and eyes. Afterward, smooth the hair as if combing it, and alternately massage the arms with the hands.\n\nThis visualization method may be practiced whenever there is leisure, day or night. First, rub the palms until hot, then wipe the face and eyes several times. Rub the palms together again, then wipe the face once more, repeating this four or five times. Then, pass the hands behind the neck and to the temples, alternately massaging the temples upward as if combing the hair, stopping after several dozen repetitions. Though this is a fine method for restoring youthful complexion and reversing gray hair, the character *er* (而) here is used in its standard sense.\n\nThis method comes from the *Scripture of the Elixir Landscape* and bestows a lustrous complexion, prevents wrinkles and blemishes, keeps hair from turning white, and prevents veins from protruding. After five years of practice, one’s countenance will resemble that of a young maiden—what is called \"the *qi* of mountains and rivers, ever full and never depleted.\" This is the essence of the lower-grade *Dao of the Elixir Landscape*, which states that one should always be as full of *qi* as mountains and rivers, causing even trees and stones to flourish with vitality.\n\n**Recorded by the Prefect**\n\nUpon waking, there is no need to rise early—this may be done at any time after waking from sleep. First, calm the breath and regulate the *qi*, making inhalations and exhalations slow and subtle. Sit upright, facing the direction of the moon’s current palace. Clasp the hands together, then reverse the clasp and extend the arms fully forward. Bring them up to cover the back of the neck, then tilt the head back to look upward, raising the neck and lifting both hands, straining against them three or four times.\n\n*(The character *xing* (兴) means \"to rise\"; here, it refers to clasping the hands to cover the back of the neck, then tilting the head back to raise the neck, exerting force as if struggling, then lowering it gently. Repeat this three or four times, and one may hear the neck bones crack. The character *xing* may also be written as *yu* (与).)*\n\nAfterward, move and bend the body: unclasp the hands, lower the head, bend at the waist, and rotate the back, with the feet possibly lifting and resting. Stretch the hands to the four extremes: raise both hands above the head, then extend them forcefully to the sides, bringing them forward before stretching them fully backward, reversing the stretch. For the reverse stretch and side pulls, first arch the waist backward, then bring the hands together to follow the body, swaying left and right and pulling to the sides. To \"proclaim and shake the hundred joints,\" continue moving vigorously, ensuring that the limbs, feet, hands, arms, and knees all circulate fully. Perform each movement three times, repeating the entire sequence three times—this does not mean completing all movements before starting over.\n\nThis is a matter of oral instruction: the movements of the four limbs cannot all be recorded in writing, so the oral instructions must detail their forms and applications. The intent is simply to follow the annotations provided.\n\n**From the *Essential Scripture of the Great Cavern: Massage Section of the Elixir Landscape***\nThis practice harmonizes essence and blood, prevents the intrusion of wind-*qi*, and if practiced long enough, confers immunity to death and illness. This is an example from the *Great Cavern*—the scroll titles are numerous and not limited to the thirty-nine chapters. Later references to the *Upper Scroll of the Elixir Landscape of the Great Cavern* and the *Great Cavern’s Grand Exorcism Incantation* show that there are many such texts.\n\n**Recorded by the Prefect**\n\nUpon waking, first use a handkerchief or thick cloth to wipe the neck on all sides and behind the ears, ensuring thorough coverage until warm. Then, smooth the hair and massage the neck as if combing it countless times. After a long while, massage both hands and treat the face and eyes. When finished, swallow saliva thirty times to guide the internal fluids.\n\n*(This means that upon first waking, one should face the moon’s palace and perform this method before proceeding to the clasped-hand and reverse-stretch practices.)*\n\n**From the *Upper Chapter of the Essential Scripture of the Elixir Landscape of the Great Cavern***\nWith prolonged practice, this method sharpens the eyes, prevents the intrusion of evil *qi*, and keeps the body free from filth and grime.",

      "translated_text": "**Recorded by the Prefect**\n\nThe character ** is pronounced as *nì*, with the initial of *女* and the final of *忌*.\n\nIf the body feels unwell—meaning one senses discomfort without a specific ailment—press the tongue against the throat, rinse with saliva, and swallow repeatedly. Forcefully curl the tongue upward to block the throat while rinsing and swallowing. Soon, the discomfort will dissipate, and the body will feel relaxed and supple. This method may also be combined with the various massage and visualization practices described herein.\n\n**From the *Upper Scroll of the Scripture of Dissolving and Rubbing the Numinous Sequence***\n\nThe *Dissolving and Rubbing* section, like the chapters of the *Great Cavern*, is by no means insignificant.\n\n**Recorded by the Prefect**\n\nThe four preceding methods do not specify which Perfected One transmitted them.\n\nFrequently press and rub the ears on both sides without count, sharpening one’s hearing. This is called \"tending the city walls\" and is recorded in the *Imperial Register*. An alternate version reads \"tending the city walls,\" with no discrepancy in meaning. Since the ears mark the boundaries of the face, they must be properly tended.\n\nFrequently press the sides of the nose to regulate the breath, ensuring evenness. This is called \"irrigating the Central Peak\" and is recorded in the *Emperor’s Record*. The nose is the mountain peak of the face, the \"Central Peak within the Inner Landscape.\"\n\nDiligently tend to the nose, and regularly remove hairs from the nostrils to keep them clean and unobstructed. Both practices may be performed at leisure: use the hands to press, rub, and tend the ears and nose without count. Thus, the city walls will stand firm, the mountain peaks will tower in splendor, and the *Imperial Register* and *Emperor’s Record* may be inscribed.\n\n**These two methods were transmitted by Lady Li of the Terrace of Illuminating Numinosity, as recorded in the *Upper Scroll of the Scripture of Dissolving and Rubbing***. The character *照* should be *昭*, an error in transcription.\n\n**Recorded by the Prefect**\n\nRegularly cover the mouth with the hand while breathing gently with eyes closed. Over time, saliva will accumulate in the palm; use it to massage and wipe the face. Consistent practice imparts fragrance to the body.\n\nPlace both hands upright over the nose and mouth, allowing breath to pass beneath them. When saliva forms, use it to massage and wipe, then cover again. There is no fixed number of repetitions, but this practice enhances one’s radiance.\n\n**From the *Scripture of the Red Character Stone Landscape***\n\nFrequently press the corners of the eyes and the sides of the nose while holding the breath. When the breath flows smoothly, stop; exhale and begin anew. With persistent practice, the eyes will gain penetrating vision. Use the third finger of each hand to press the inner corners of the eyes beside the nose. There is no fixed number of repetitions; when the breath flows, slightly lift the fingers, then close and press again. This may also be done twenty-seven times.\n\n**From the *Three Scriptures of the Celestial Pass of the Supreme***\n\nThe *Lower Scroll* mentions the *Three Illustrated Scriptures of the Celestial Pass*; the character *图* may be missing.\n\nRegularly lie down with eyes closed, relax the body, and breathe gently to appear as if asleep, so others remain unaware. This may be practiced at any time, day or night, not only when resting. The head should rest evenly on the pillow, aligning the breath and calming the *qi*.\n\nInwardly gaze and listen to the four directions, extending one’s ears and eyes to a hundred thousand *li*. With prolonged practice, one will naturally perceive events at a distance of ten thousand *li*. Focus the mind intently, and the visions will become clear.\n\nBegin by focusing on one direction. For example, direct the ears and eyes eastward to see mountains, rivers, and city walls, and hear mysterious sounds, forming indistinct yet vivid impressions. Feel as though one’s senses extend far into the distance, forgetting the body’s form—this is ideal. One may start with one *li*, then ten, a hundred, or a thousand, gradually expanding the range.\n\nOne may also constantly hear the sounds of gold, jade, silk, and bamboo within the ears. This is a sublime method. Initially, one visualizes hearing them; later, the sounds become real.\n\nThe \"four directions\" are mentioned collectively, but one should begin with a single direction, inwardly directing sight and hearing. At first, there may be no clear impressions, but with time and sincerity, one will naturally attain mastery. All Daoist visualization practices follow this principle. Without accumulating months and years of practice or deep sincerity, one will not perceive the underlying patterns. Do not abandon the practice simply because immediate results are not felt. Those who drill through stone or bow before mountains may be said to possess true resolve.\n\n**From the *Inner Visualization of the Central Directions in the Scripture of Purple Radiance and Blazing Light***\n\nWhen sitting, regularly close the eyes and inwardly visualize the five viscera and intestines. With prolonged practice, their forms and colors will become distinctly clear. During visualization, imagine their shapes, colors, order, relative positions, and sizes as if describing them. The names and sequences of the organs are recorded in the *Twenty-Four Spirits*; they will not be repeated here.\n\n**From the *Scripture of the Three and Five in Harmony with the Purple Writ of the Cinnabar Character***\n\nWhen eating, do not speak of death or expose food, lest various evil *qi* gather. While eating, always face the direction of one’s life destiny and the *wang qi*. All food, whether hot or cold, should be covered. Ghosts and evil spirits delight in approaching to partake of the aroma, turning the remaining flavors turbid and foul, which can also cause illness.\n\nBathe frequently. On *jiazi* days, one should bathe; if not, then on the first day of each month. This practice enhances spiritual clarity. The \"odd months\" refer to the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh months. If a *jiazi* day falls within these months, one may bathe again.\n\nTo dispel corpse *qi*, use the royal days of the four seasons. For immortals’ taboos, use the eleventh day of the eleventh month. The Nine Perfected also use the third day of the third month and the fifth day of the fifth month—all suitable for bathing. Bathing once or twice a month is ideal. The concern is not frequency but the practitioner’s diligence. Washing away the stench of the corpse allows true *qi* to enter.\n\nThe Perfected One of Purple Yang stated: \"Bathe frequently to wash away the *qi* of illness and eliminate the blemishes of accumulated decay. This is also the path to attaining the true.\"\n\nLady of the Purple Tenuity said: \"Infrequent bathing is the nature of the *po*. To oppose the *po* and return to correctness, refine away its turbidity and filth, and the *po* will naturally vanish. Knowing this, one should bathe frequently. This practice is simple, though using warm water in winter may be slightly challenging.\"",

      "translated_text": "When bathing, frequently invoke the Six Dings, and all your aspirations will be fulfilled as desired. This means maintaining regular washing day and night, and even during the act of bathing, one may invoke them. The Six Dings are the Six Ding Spirit Maidens, deities readily responsive to human communion and easily summoned. One should also face the direction where the Six Dings reside—during the *jiazi* cycle, this is the *mao* direction. Each of these Jade Maidens has distinct names and attire, as recorded in the *Lingfei*.\n\nWhen combing hair, face the direction of the monthly *wang* (ruling position). This applies to all acts of grooming, washing, or combing the hair. According to the immortals’ taboos, one must never comb hair facing north. In the eleventh month, when *zi* is established, one should still face *hai*; the due north is strictly forbidden. At the very beginning of combing, when the comb first touches the hair, recite the following incantation while combing:\n\n*\"Mud-pellet’s mysterious blossom, preserve essence and endure,\nLeft, the hidden moon; right, the sun’s root.\nThe Six Harmonies refine and purify,\nA hundred spirits receive grace.\"*\n\nAfter reciting, swallow saliva three times.\n\nThe phrase \"left moon, right sun\" signifies the mutual interpenetration of yin and yang, embodying the principle of the Three Hun’s flying essence in purple script. Thus, they are called the \"hidden root.\" *Xuanhua* is the name of the hair spirit, and the *Six Harmonies* refer to the residence beneath the temples. All incantations carry profound meaning, not merely this passage alone.\n\nThe above eight clauses were commanded by the Mystic Master, the Lady of South Marchmount, for implementation. Recorded by the Prefect.\n\nWhen combing hair, face the direction of the *wang* position. At the very start of combing—here, \"start\" replaces \"beginning\"—recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Mud-pellet’s mysterious blossom, preserve essence and endure,\nLeft, the hidden moon; right, the sun’s root.\nThe Six Harmonies refine and purify,\nA hundred spirits receive grace.\"*\n\nAfter reciting, swallow saliva three times.\n\nThe Lady of South Marchmount had already received this method, and now Lady An has also transmitted it. This suggests that though they were unaware of each other’s teachings, the method remains identical. Practicing this regularly will prevent hair loss and promote daily growth. One should frequently change combs, using many teeth without causing pain. The phrase \"frequently comb\" means to alternate the areas being combed. The Lady of Purple Tenuity also advised using combs in rotation, as using a single comb may generate heat, harming the scalp and hair. Thus, one should alternate among four or five combs to keep them cool. Alternatively, one may have an attendant comb the hair thoroughly.\n\nScholars of the Dao do not allow others near their clothing or mats; how much less should they permit others to comb their hair? This should be done personally. Thus, blood and fluids will flow unimpeded, and hair roots will remain firm.\n\nThe above, recorded by the Prefect, is based on the instructions from Jiuhua for implementation, said to originate from the *Tai Ji Lü Jing*.\n\nThe *Zhen Gao* states: When combing or grooming hair, do so frequently to circulate blood and qi, dispersing wind and dampness. Alternate combs in rotation, and there is no need to loosen the hair. The matter of combing hair has been emphasized by the Three Perfected Ones, for it is an urgent practice to be observed. I earnestly urge Immortal Marquis to follow this path to restore black hair.\n\nRecorded by the Prefect, as spoken by the Lady of Purple Tenuity.",

      "translated_text": "If one treads upon filth or any unclean place, one should bathe to purify the body and dispel it. The method uses ten liang of bamboo leaves—any bamboo leaves may be used, for the essence of those from the northern loom is not distinguished by species. Take four liang of white inner bark from the peach tree (dried may also be used); this refers to the bark of the edible peach, including those growing wild in the mountains, not the mountain peach. Both ingredients are measured by the ancient scale, with dried peach bark halved in quantity. Boil them in one *hu* and two *dou* of clear water in a cauldron, allowing it to come to a single boil—just once, without seeking thickness. Remove and adjust to a suitable temperature to bathe the body, and all impurities will be dissolved. This not only removes filth but also wards off damp impediment, sores, and itching. Moreover, bamboo is hollow and pure within, while peach repels evil and dispels foulness; thus, these two substances are used to purge the body’s turbidity. Bamboo’s nature is hollow and its interior pristine, while peach governs the expulsion of filth—these two *qi* complement each other. As the *Rites* states: When a lord attends a minister’s funeral, the shaman-priest first sweeps away evil with a peach-wood broom. This, too, is to dispel malign *qi*. When celestial beings descend and return, they never fail to cleanse themselves with this water. When perfected ones descend to the world, their forms cannot but be tainted by foul *qi*; thus, peach and bamboo are used in the baths of the palaces on famous mountains. This may sound harsh, but if true, how greatly do immortals differ from mortals? Only in their ability to ascend the void and escape death. As for the talismanic waters and incantations of the mundane world—mere external arts of the outer schools—none compare to this formula. There are old methods for dispelling filth, but beside this, they are like a mound beside Mount Fanghu. If one bathes, it is even better, though this water should not be used for washing the hair. The refined corpse’s pure essence is precisely for bathing—truly a wondrous secret. After bathing, one should wash the hair as usual, not with this water. If, after washing the hair, one rinses it slightly with this water, there is no harm. This water is also called the *Refined Corpse’s Pure Essence*, meant solely for bathing. Dispelling filth is urgent for the student; this secret formula is beyond price.\n\nThe above was commanded for use by Lady Wang of Purple Tenuity, said to originate from the *Tai Shang Jiu Bian Shi Hua Yi Xin Jing*. Recorded by the Prefect.\n\nWhen ingesting immortal medicines, always face the direction of one’s life destiny. After ingestion, do not speak of death, mourning, or inauspicious matters, lest one harm the spirit and waste the medicine’s benefit. All immortal elixirs and worldly formulas should be taken thus, except for the *Initial Spirit Pill* and *Golden Elixir*, which are taken facing east.\n\nThe above was told to Master Yang by the Eastern Minister. Recorded by the Prefect in two versions.\n\nMaster said: At midnight, remove the pillow and lie flat, clench the fists, relax the body, and regulate the breath until it is subtle—then the body’s spirits are complete. If any are lacking, rise quickly, burn incense, sit upright with eyes closed, clench the fists over the knees, and visualize the body’s spirits. Envision a white *qi* the size of a chicken’s egg before the eyes, and the spirits will be restored. Practice this once every five days. This method follows the visualization of the twenty-four spirits, though here it speaks only of visualizing the spirits without mentioning their origin—likely a summary of that practice. The white *qi* in the eyes pertains to the *Way of the Bright Mirror*, but practicing it every five days is merely the mirror’s work, not the full restoration of the spirits. Perhaps it may be integrated for use, but if one is cultivating the great scriptures, this may be omitted.\n\nMaster said: The method of *shi gui* sharpens the eyes and, with time, grants penetrating vision. The twenty-four spirits are called the *Way of the Wiping Youth*, enabling one to clearly see the twenty-four spirits. On the *gengwu* day within the *jiazi* ten-day period, at noon, take clear east-flowing water and mix it with true cinnabar. Use one *dou* of water and two *zhu* of true pearl, stirring twenty-one times toward the moon’s position. Wash the eyes with this, facing east at dawn, twenty-one times. The scripture says: Always face east and wash the eyes twenty-one times. Regular practice is excellent. This is but a rough summary of the scriptural method; if one has already practiced the original method, this is no longer needed. Most scriptural formulas and techniques prove ineffective, as is often the case. Such brevity—how could it compare to the original scripture? If one has not seen the original method, this may be employed. Thus, those who toil in vain into old age do so because of such incomplete teachings.\n\nMaster said: To cultivate the Way, visualize the sun and moon in the eyes, always seeing their forms. Also visualize the left eye as the sun and the right as the moon. Listen for the master’s voice in the ears, always hearing the master’s sound, including speech and breath, taking them as models. The mouth constantly exhales the dead and inhales the living *qi*, adjusting to the four seasons’ waxing and waning. For example, in spring, exhale yellow and inhale green. Embody the five stars, as in Master Pei’s visualization, with the five stars positioned to the left, right, front, back, and above the head. Walk as if treading empty space, moving as though in the void, not as if pacing the Dipper or riding the net. The mind constantly contemplates long life; in sitting, lying, walking, and coming, always think of immortality. Be cautious in laughter and measured in speech—why speak much when unnecessary? Constantly reflect on one’s form, always recognizing one’s own appearance and complexion. These are essential practices. Though these methods lack formal techniques for cultivation, they are the wellsprings of learning.\n\nThe above two passages are said to be Master Pei’s words. Recorded by the Prefect and his assistant in two versions.\n\nFrom the beginning to this point, there are thirty-seven matters concerning court rituals, nurturing life, and daily practices. Whenever traversing dangerous paths, passing through ghostly temples, or encountering places of doubt or subtle taboo, one should first curl the tongue inward to press against the throat. Only after reciting the incantation should the tongue be extended.",
      "overlap_context": "originate from the *Tai Ji Lü Jing*.\n\nThe *Zhen Gao* states: When combing or grooming hair, do so frequently to circulate blood and qi, dispersing wind and dampness. Alternate combs in rotation, and there is no need to loosen the hair. The matter of combing hair has been emphasized by the Three Perfected Ones, for it is an urgent practice to be observed. I earnestly urge Immortal Marquis to follow this path to restore black hair.\n\nRecorded by the Prefect, as spoken by the Lady of Purple Tenuity.",

Press firmly without lifting the fingers to count. This firm pressing is done while silently counting, with each breath marking one cycle.\n\nThe region between the nasal septum and the nostrils is called the *Mountain Source*, also known as the *Ghost Well*, the *Divine Pool*, the *Root of Evil*, or the *Terrace of the Hun*. As these five names appear in the later incantation, they are first clarified here. The Lady of Purple Tenuity states: \"The *Mountain Source* lies at the base of the philtrum beneath the nose, slightly recessed within the valley.\" If needled with a pin, it can also treat sudden death.\n\nAfter pinching, knock the teeth seven times.

      "translated_text": "If one recites this incantation by day or night, it becomes a perpetual invocation. There is no fixed time for its practice; whenever one has leisure or at the junctures of dawn and dusk, in any place of doubt or darkness, one may recite it—whispering the words.\n\nWhen ghosts hear this incantation thrice, their eyes rot and blind, and their bodies perish at once. This refers to all slaying ghosts and malevolent spirits, as well as the inherently wicked and powerful ghosts that roam between heaven and earth. Upon hearing this, they die—not the lingering souls of the dead who become ghosts. Such ghosts do possess eyes, and thus their blindness and decay bring immediate death.\n\nThis divine incantation bears the authority of the Office of Ghost-Slaying. Within its words lie the titles of the officials of Fengdu and the names of the gods, so that ghosts hear it and die in terror. The \"thousand warriors led by Xu, wielding the might of the southern forces\" are those who repel evil. The Flame Emperor is the Emperor of Hai, and the Four Luminaries are the Lords of the Four Directions. The Northern Emperor guards this Way in secrecy, for he commands the spirits and men who dispel ghosts. If one encounters this incantation, the ghosts can no longer prevail, hence its secrecy.\n\nShould one in this world obtain and practice this incantation, it becomes the Way to avoid death. All human death is caused by the slaying of ghosts and spirits; once they can no longer claim a life, one ceases to die. Men and women, young and old, may all practice it—only hindered by ignorance of the spell. Those who know it must use it in secret, for its power knows no bounds of age or stature.\n\nThese words seem intended for the household of a chief administrator. When afflicted by illness, reciting this brings instant recovery. If ghosts flee, how can sickness remain? When tapping the teeth, one should close the eyes and visualize the five viscera, each inhabited by its respective spirit—this arises naturally.\n\nAt the first tap of the teeth, twenty-six times, one should close the eyes and inwardly behold the five viscera in sequence, imagining each clearly. The spirits of the five viscera reside within; only then can one align with the true and subdue the perverse, commanding the spirits and executing ghosts.\n\nThe secrets of this incantation are held within Fengdu. Now they are discreetly shared—let them not be revealed to the unworthy, but guarded by those of the Dao. Though this is not the highest scripture of the perfected, it is the supreme art of vanquishing ghosts. With evil dispelled, the true qi may be harnessed, and the slaying of malevolence tested—an essential method for the seeker.\n\nYet many dismiss it as too simple or minor, allowing it to be passed down carelessly. Thus, the divine incantation’s efficacy remains hidden, its power unexercised—a grave error.\n\n*—Copied from the two manuscripts of Master Yang and Chancellor Yuan.*\n\nMount Fengdu lies in the north, in the Gui region. Above and below it are palaces of ghosts and spirits. On the mountain stand six palaces, and within its caverns lie six more, identical in name and form.\n\nThe first palace is called the Palace of Zhou, Severer of the Yin Heaven. Proceeding eastward, the second is the Palace of Tai Sha, the Solemn and Just Ancestor of Heaven. The third is the Palace of Ming Chen, the Enduring and Defiant Warrior City of Heaven. The fourth is the Palace of Tian Zhao, the Serene Illuminator of Sinful Qi. The fifth is the Palace of Zong Ling, the Sevenfold Nonconformity of Heaven. The sixth is the Palace of Gan Si, the Daring Controller of the Winding and Repeated Heaven.\n\nThese six palaces share the same names within and without. The first lies farthest west, with the rest arrayed eastward, all facing south. Each palace spans a thousand li, serving as the abode of all ghosts and spirits. Should one know the names of the six heavenly palace gates of Fengdu, no ghost will dare to harm them.\n\nEarlier, it was said that \"stone\" refers to the palace names, while here and in the incantation, they are called gate names. The gates take their names from the palaces, hence the shared designation. When ghosts hear one recite these names, they recognize the speaker as a master of the heavenly palaces and dare not offend.\n\nBefore lying down, one should face north and recite the invocation thrice, softly. One may also slightly incline toward the Gui direction, reciting the full text once. Upon completion, tap the teeth six times, then recite it again—three times in total.\n\nThe incantation reads:\n*\"I am a disciple of the Most High, governing the Six Heavens below. The palaces of the Six Heavens are my domain—not only my domain, but the dominion of the Most High. I know the names of the Six Heavens’ palaces, and thus I attain long life. Should any dare to offend, the Most High shall sever your form. The first palace is named the Palace of Zhou, Severer of the Yin Heaven. Proceeding eastward, the second palace is named...\"*\n\nEach recitation consists of one hundred nineteen characters. Proceed in order until all six palaces are named. Then tap the teeth six times before lying down. After three recitations, one may attend to other matters—this practice alone suffices to repel all ghostly and malevolent qi.\n\nAt dusk, first recite the *Stone Stalagmite Text*, then read the *Ode to the Fengdu Palaces of the Pillars of Liang City*:\n*\"Zhou severs the dawn’s rule,\nSolemn affairs weave the layered peaks.\nFlaming as mist in the skies,\nBursting like radiant blossoms.\nWu Yang bears the divine blade,\nTian Zhao devours the clear river.\nThe Gate of Heaven overlooks the cinnabar well,\nCloud Gates rise in towering majesty.\nThe Sevenfold Nonconformity spreads its wondrous canopy,\nThe Winding and Repeated unfurl their demonic might.\nThe Six Heavens bar the northern path—\nThis is the abode of ghosts and spirits.\"*\n\nThe ode spans twenty thousand words; here, only the names of the Six Heavenly Palaces are excerpted. One may softly recite it at night—it, too, repels ghosts. Since it contains the names of the palace gates, ghosts fear it.\n\nIn the earlier text, the third palace is named *Wu Cheng* (Warrior City), while the ode calls it *Wu Yang* (Warrior Sun). This may indicate dual names or separate meanings—it is likely not an error.\n\n*—Two passages from Master Zhong’s teachings. Copied from the two manuscripts of Master Yang and Chancellor Yuan.*",

      "translated_text": "When traveling at night, one should always click the teeth—there is no fixed number of clicks. The sound of clicking teeth terrifies both *sha-ghosts* and *xie-ghosts*, ensuring they do not harm one. The *sha-ghosts* are those dispatched by the Supreme of Fengdu to claim lives, while the *xie-ghosts* are malevolent spirits and *wangliang* that lurk between heaven and earth to harm people. If one combines this with rinsing the mouth and reciting incantations, the effect is even better.\n\nThe *Immortal Methods* states: \"Regularly swallowing saliva and clicking the teeth can make one revert to youth. Clicking the teeth prevents external ghosts from invading while keeping the inner spirits ever vigilant; swallowing saliva ensures harmonious qi is always abundant, nourishing the flesh and marrow, thus warding off illness and aging.\"\n\n*—From Master Zhong’s teachings. Copied from the two manuscripts of Master Yang and Chancellor Yuan.*\n\nIn the mortal realm, there are fierce and malevolent ghosts of the lower earth who often appear as women to deceive and test people. These cunning ghosts and old spirits are adept at such transformations—not only as women but also taking forms based on one’s desires, leading those who follow them into confusion and delusion. Beginners whose minds are not yet steadfast and pure, harboring impure thoughts, often attract such encounters and must repel them.\n\nIf this occurs, hold your breath and visualize the *Central Balance* star within the *Celestial Pass*, the image of the *Big Dipper*, with the *Xuanji*, *Heng*, *Fu*, and *Bi* stars all guarding the *cun* position, its handle pointing forward to encompass the body’s spirits. Focus on the *cun*, the *Hall of Light’s* three palaces, and the twenty-four spirits within the five viscera. Compose your expression, steady your will, and gaze intently at the pupil of their eye. If the pupil is murky and unclear, it is a ghostly test.\n\nOne should then draw near with caution and observe their eyes—if the pupils appear dim, know they are not immortals but *xie-ghosts*. Alternatively, one may test them with a bright mirror. Upon recognizing a ghostly test, visualize the Seven Stars before your face or above your head to dispel it. One may also imagine the Seven Stars emerging from the *cun* to cover the head, the handle pointing forward, and strike them. Alternatively, silently recite incantations such as *Tianmu* or *Tianpeng*.\n\nIf the pupil is square and bright, they are a true immortal. Even if not perfectly square, if the eyes are clear and bright, they may still be a person of the *Xun* path. When illuminated by fire or sunlight, they cast no shadow—this further confirms their authenticity. Those who perceive this should bow in reverence; those who fail to recognize it have not passed the test. To mistake a *xie-ghost* for a true immortal is also a failure of discernment—take heed.\n\nThese two matters are the most difficult to distinguish.

      "translated_text": "The preceding six matters all concern methods to expel demonic spirits and guard against ghostly trials. The *Mingtang Inner Scripture*’s *Heart-Opening Talisman to Dispel Delusion* was compiled and employed by Lord Wang. The talisman appears in the sixth volume’s *Talisman and Diagram Manual*; this is the method of the one-inch *Mingtang* within the heart. There should also be a separate major scripture, but here I excerpt only the matter of dispelling delusion.\n\nLord Wang is the Supreme Minister of the Assembly of Perfected. On the *kai*-day at dawn, face the direction of Wang, write in cinnabar, bow twice, and ingest it. At dawn, following the monthly branch, write in cinnabar on white paper, then hold it in the left hand, bow, recite the incantation, and ingest it. The incantation reads:\n\n*\"Five spirits open the heart,\npiercing hearing, cutting off sound.\nThree hun souls gather essence,\nall guard the cinnabar heart.\nLet me not be deluded;\nfive viscera seek afar.\"*\n\nAfter bowing and reciting, ingest the talisman, then swallow saliva five times and click the teeth five times. Do not let others see. If the *kai*-day is not used, take it on the first, fifteenth, and twenty-seventh days of the month—three times a month. In one year, the secret talisman will prove efficacious. Those who do not know the *kai*-day may use these two days; now one may also take it five or six times a month.\n\n*—From the two manuscripts of the Chief Clerk and Chancellor.*\n\nThe Eastern Flower Perfected’s method of ingesting the images of the sun and moon is a superior practice. In the Eastern Flower Palace, both men and women who attain perfection still employ it. Thus, the method of solar radiance remains preserved by the Azure Lord. Men ingest the solar image; women ingest the lunar image. Do not neglect this daily, for it sharpens clarity, illuminates the five viscera, refines the hun and po souls, harmonizes the six bowels, and is the Way of long life and deathlessness.\n\nAt dawn, face east, write the solar image in cinnabar on blue paper, hold it in the left hand, visualize it as a sun the size of a pellet, crimson with purple radiance, then ingest it, swallowing it into the heart so its light shines through. Afterward, click the teeth nine times and swallow saliva nine times. Women ingest the lunar image, writing in yellow on blue paper, holding it in the right hand, also facing east to ingest and visualize it entering the heart.\n\n*Huimeng* (回月)—these two characters are copied from the original in cinnabar.\n\n*—Method for writing the solar and lunar images. The sun may also be written as a circle. Now that both square and circular forms exist, along with the unaltered character for \"sun,\" one should follow this. In the *Purple Text of the Great Mystery Talisman*, the character for \"sun\" is written as a circle. Since it is called the \"image of the sun and moon,\" it should resemble the characters for sun and moon. Moreover, ancient scripts occasionally depict the character for \"moon\" in its shape, hence the *Eight Styles of Calligraphy* term it \"pictographic.\" If one ingests the circular form, the character should likewise be written thus. All have established methods in the *Talisman and Diagram Manual.*\n\n*—From Lord Yang’s manuscript.*\n\nThe Supreme Void Perfected, the Crimson Lord of Southern Marchmount, taught this inner method: On the fifth night of the month at midnight, visualize the solar image within the heart, as if the sun enters through the mouth, illuminating the heart’s interior to merge with the sun’s light. Whether sitting or lying down, first visualize the sun as crimson with nine rays of purple radiance, suddenly entering the mouth and settling in the heart, its inner and outer light merging as one. Afterward, one should feel the heart warm, suffused with rosy glow. Initially, merely visualize to warm the heart; over time, one will truly feel its heat. Focus the mind’s essence, and the effect will come easily.\n\nAfter a long while, recite the incantation:\n*\"Great brightness nurtures essence,\ninternally refining the cinnabar heart.\nLight and radiance merge,\ndivine perfected ones come seeking.\"*\n\nThen swallow saliva nine times. On the fifteenth, twenty-fifth, and twenty-ninth days, repeat the above method. These three days are all auspicious, being conjunctions of solar and lunar cycles. Later texts state that one should practice frequently, not strictly on these days—indeed, one may perform this every midnight. It sharpens perception, unblocks all passages, bestows a jade-like glow to the face and a golden luster to the body. Practicing for fifteen years, the Great One will dispatch a *baoche* to welcome you, ascending to the Great Empyrean.\n\nAnother authentic manuscript states: After five years of practice, the Great One will send the Jade Guardian Duke to descend and welcome you—this likely refers to the *tuoche* (chariot). Here it simply says *baoche*, which is still the carriage of the Jade Guardian Duke. Practice frequently, not only on these days.\n\n*—This passage is excerpted from the *Scripture of the Supreme High on Dispelling and Polishing.*\"*",

      "translated_text": "This version originates from the *Scripture of Wisdom and Dispelling* and was excerpted and employed by Lord Chi, hence it is termed an \"inner method.\" The Prefect copied two versions.\n\nThe Eastern Flower Palace possesses the method of ingesting the radiance of the sun and moon, which even perfected immortals continue to practice. It involves simply visualizing a sun within the heart, the size of a coin, crimson in color. As for the term \"simply visualize,\" its origin is now unknown—it does not enter through the mouth but is perceived solely within the heart as a solar form. Though no larger than a coin, it is not flat but spherical, like a pellet, nine *fen* in diameter, of a pure crimson hue. One further visualizes the sun as having nine rays, which are also said to be crimson, though not explicitly called \"rays.\" According to later passages, the moon’s rays are white, so the sun’s rays should be violet. From the heart, it ascends through the throat to the teeth, where one visualizes nine violet rays, all rising into the mouth with their tips pointing toward the teeth but not emerging. At this time, the mouth is closed and the teeth are clenched; only the rays emerge, not the solar form itself—this is what is meant by \"ingesting the sun’s rays.\" The rays then return to the stomach. While the rays ascend, the sun remains visualized above the heart, its radiant tips extending to the roots of the teeth, lingering within the throat and chest, illuminating the mouth and teeth. After a long while, the ray-tips curl backward, descending from the throat into the stomach. The distance from the stomach to the heart is equal to that from the throat to the heart, and the rays neither extend nor retract. After some time, with eyes closed, one clearly perceives within the heart and stomach: the sun remains in the heart while the rays reside in the stomach, causing light to flow and suffuse the organs, making the abdomen slightly warm. One then exhales, rinses the mouth with saliva, and swallows the fluid thirty-nine times before stopping. The exhalation refers to the initial visualization, where the mouth and teeth are closed and breath is held. Only after completing the visualization does one release the breath, open the teeth, rinse the mouth with saliva, and swallow it, visualizing the fluid as violet. This is performed three times daily: at dawn facing east, at noon facing south, and at dusk facing west, each time sitting upright, closing the eyes, holding the breath, and visualizing. Practicing this for one year dispels illness; for five years, the body gains a radiant luster; for eighteen years, one attains the Dao, casts no shadow at noon, and repels all malevolent spirits, evil influences, and calamitous qi. If one ingests the forms of the sun and moon directly, the time required is less than eighteen years; since this method involves only the rays, it is slightly slower.\n\nThe sun and moon constantly reside within the body, merging with one’s form to illuminate it, hence the absence of shadow. With all spirits radiant and clear, how could evil dare to approach? One should constantly visualize the sun in the heart and the moon in the *niwan* (Mud-Pill Palace). The phrase \"constantly visualize\" clarifies that this is not limited to the time of ingestion, as the sun and moon do not leave the mouth. At night, one ingests the moon’s essence in the same manner as the sun, visualizing both without needing to see their true forms—simply remain indoors. Since the moon is used at night, one may also practice while lying down, performing it three times during the hours of *wu*, *zi*, and *chou*. The earlier reference to the moon residing in the *niwan* refers to the *niwan* Palace of the Upper Cinnabar Field; the Mysterious Cinnabar is also called *niwan*. Elsewhere, the *Xuan Zhen* method visualizes the moon in the Hall of Brightness, but these are separate practices. Here, since the sun resides in the heart, the seat of the perfected, the moon should correspondingly dwell in the Chamber of the Red Child, aligning with the principle—hence it is placed in the Upper Cinnabar Field.\n\nOne visualizes the moon’s ten rays as white. Though the moon’s color is yellow, these rays are white, precisely the ten rays of the Daoist moon, which are white. This further clarifies that the moon’s form does not descend through the mouth. The visualized moon is one *cun* in diameter. From the brain, it descends into the throat. The Nine Palaces all reside within the brain, so since the moon is in the *niwan*, it may be called the brain. Moreover, this emphasizes that it does not exit externally but descends inward. Among the Nine Palaces, only the *niwan* Palace has an aperture connecting to the throat. One visualizes the ten rays descending directly from the *niwan* through the nasal passages, with five rays emerging from each nostril into the throat, their tips also pointing toward the teeth. The rays do not emerge from the teeth but return to the stomach. At this time, the mouth and teeth are closed as before, and the rays are held within the mouth, filling it with light. They then turn backward and descend into the stomach. One exhales, rinses with white fluid, and swallows thirty-nine times. Upon completion, the rays connected to the brain abruptly vanish.\n\nThe above was transmitted by the Lady of the Southern Culmen, who stated that this method is practiced by all perfected immortals and derives from the upper and middle chapters of the *Great Scripture of Wisdom*. Those who practice it diligently will witness the Great Peace. Lord Wang of the Western City said: \"Practicing this method of the sun in the heart and the moon in the *niwan* is simple and easy to grasp, with no risk of abandonment midway. It requires no incantations or invocations, nor does one need to see the sun and moon—the visualization is not difficult, and it does not burden one with excessive methods while in the mortal realm. It is the way to eliminate the Three Corpses, the hundred illnesses, and the thousand evils, and to refine the hun and po souls. When the sun and moon constantly illuminate the body, ghosts have no place to hide; when one’s form is perpetually inhabited by the sun and moon, evil spirits cannot lurk—hence one remains free from illness. The Azure Lord now practices this, and I am that very person.\"\n\nThis matter from the *Scripture of Wisdom* is not limited to this single method; even the *Zong Zhen* also employs it. Practicing this method does not hinder the ingestion of the sun and moon as described in the *Precious Scriptures*; indeed, combining them is even better. The \"sun and moon of the Precious Scriptures\" refers to the *Five Elders’ Precious Canon*, specifically the method of the Three Hun in the *Purple Texts*. Since this method differs in its internal and external aspects, it may be practiced concurrently. At dawn and dusk, one should first visualize and ingest the rays indoors, then, when the sun and moon appear, proceed with the method of the radiant mist.\n\nI now reveal this to you—this is addressed to Lord Yang. It may be discreetly shared with those of sincere intent. Instruct the Prefect’s aide accordingly. An immortal performs a thousand tasks in a single day and night without feeling weary, demonstrating the utmost diligence in the Dao—such an opportunity in life must not be squandered. Once one is called an immortal, the body naturally endures labor; this refers to those destined for immortality.",

To lose this life is to await another ten thousand eons—how can one not be fiercely diligent, striving to attain eternal life herein?\n\n---\n\n**Lord Yang’s Letter**\n\nSupervisor Fan of Tongchu states the method of ingesting the Three Qi: Visualize a blue qi, a white qi, and a red qi, each like a thread descending from the rising sun in the east and entering the mouth. At dawn, face the sun; if overcast or rainy, visualize facing it. Whether seated or standing, with eyes closed, envision these three colored qi aligned—blue on the left, then the others—appearing like suspended rays converging into the mouth, their roots still tethered to the sun. Draw them in ninety times, ceasing once satiated. One inhalation and one swallow count as one cycle. As the qi enters the throat, guide it to flow into the organs and viscera. When the count nears completion, gradually cease until the qi is fully absorbed.\n\nAfter ten years of practice, the Three Qi will naturally reside within the body, manifesting as three-colored qi emanating from the crown of the head. This is the *High Prime Lord’s Method of the Inner Radiance of Grand Simplicity*, a minor practice of the *Supreme Clarity Lords of the Three Primes*.\n\nPerform this daily with eyes closed, facing the sun for optimal results. Though the method is subtle, its effects are verified. Lord Xu may practice it.\n\nThis is a method of *Grand Simplicity*; if the Immortal Marquis also practices it, it is by no means inferior. However, Supervisor Fan’s attainment is limited to supervision, for among the many Daoist practices he has cultivated, he has mastered but this one. Now instructing Lord Xu to employ this method serves as mutual support, not as a fixed primary practice.\n\n---\n\n**Middle Lord’s Discourse**\n**Lord Yang’s Letter**",

      "translated_text": "**Method of Ingesting Mist, Conferred by the Perfected Lady Zhang Weizi of the Chamber of Embracing the Real upon the Jade Consort of the Eastern Flower**\n\nAt dawn’s first light, within the stillness of your chamber—where you lie abed—sit or recline as you prefer. First, close your eyes and turn your gaze inward, faintly perceiving the five viscera. Visualize their forms and colors distinctly, each in proper order. When this is complete, exhale through the mouth twenty-four times, performing this with eyes still closed. With each exhalation, expel the five-colored qi of the five viscera, so that all five qi emerge simultaneously—twenty-four cycles in all. As you exhale, maintain the inward vision of the five viscera until all are fully perceived. Then, slightly parting your eyes, continue exhaling until you see the five-colored qi intertwining before your face, swirling thickly above it.\n\nThough the text earlier speaks of exhaling qi, here it specifies five colors. These do not come from without but are the very five-colored qi of the five viscera, now tangled and interwoven, crowning your head and face. Next, draw this five-colored qi into your mouth and swallow it fifty times. As the five hues congeal and linger above your face, wait a while, then inhale them together, guiding them into your mouth to be swallowed. You will feel the five-colored qi of Heaven and Earth merging with that upon your face, both returning to their respective viscera. Each of the five qi, upon exiting and reentering, follows its own color back to its source. Perform ten swallows in sequence, beginning with the lungs, then heart, liver, kidneys, and spleen.\n\nAfterward, swallow saliva sixty times—this refers to the act of swallowing emptily. Then recite the subtle invocation:\n\n*\"Radiant dawn-glow arises,\nSpirit-mist drifts on all sides.\nCoiling qi bends and twists,\nFive colors fill the cavern-heaven.\nDivine smoke unfurls,\nGold and stone bloom with true essence.\nPurple emptiness gathers in mist,\nRefining form to preserve wholeness.\nEmerging light conceals the hidden,\nFive numina transform and divide.\nConjoined brightness fans the void,\nRiding the six clouds in due season.\nGuard and embrace this body of mine,\nAscending to the Nine Heavens.\"*\n\nWhen finished, strike the teeth together seven times, swallow saliva seven times, then open your eyes. The ritual is complete.\n\nThe preceding text describes the *Method of Ingesting Mist*, and its preface states: *\"Mist is the essence-flower of mountains, marshes, water, and fire, the overflowing qi of metal and stone.\"* Yet here, what is visualized and ingested is the qi of one’s own five viscera. Why? Because the twenty-four exhalations earlier intermingle with the external mist, merging the two smokes into one body. Thus, when you swallow fifty times in rapid succession, you are in truth ingesting mist-qi twenty-six times over.\n\nThis Way is wondrous and numinous. Many in the Mystic Capital of the Divine Continent have attained this art. Might you, too, practice it? This is also addressed to Lord Yang. With long and steadfast practice, you will come to ride clouds and mist in your travels.

      "translated_text": "Du Guangping’s received technique of *Jieying Xuanbai* is also called the *Tai Jing Zhong Jing Xuanbai Inner Method*. At all times, whether sitting or lying down, visualize as you will: within the *Niwan* there is black qi, within the heart there is white qi, and within the navel there is yellow qi. These three places are also called the Three Palaces, and they are another branch of the Three Ones, differing only in the colors of their qi. The three qi arise together like clouds to cover the body, each emerging from its original place as small as a bean, then gradually growing to envelop the crown and the entire body. They then transform into fire, which coils around the body. Though internally it has become fire, externally the three qi remain. The body becomes pervasively luminous, inner and outer as one. The fire and qi together refine the body, illuminating it inside and out. Practice this from dawn until midday, then cease.\n\nAmong all cultivation methods, this one endures the longest. In visualizing qi and fire, proceed with calm and composure, allowing gradual transformation. After refining the body, persist even longer, as if in slumber, until you no longer sense the four limbs—this is best. Then ingest qi one hundred and twenty times in total, completing the practice. Also visualize and ingest the three colored qi from before, forty times each.\n\nThis is the true Way, enabling one to attain longevity and immortality, warding off all harm. As it is said: *\"Know the white, guard the black—death cannot come; know the black, guard the white—all evil dissipates.\"* The white and black refer to the three colored qi mentioned earlier, the so-called *Xuanbai*. This saying is also drawn from the *Five Thousand Characters*.\n\nStrictly avoid the flesh of the six livestock and the flavors of the five pungents. Sleep apart in quietude to focus the mind, and above all, shun the bedchamber—for the bedchamber brings death. This method resembles *Shouyi* but is more direct and essential, thus simplified. It is abbreviated for efficiency. The prohibition against the bedchamber is even stricter than in *Shouyi*, where restraint is the key. *Shouyi* permits having children, so it does not require complete abstinence.\n\nAt first, visualize the qi emerging like small beans, gradually growing to pierce the heavens. The three qi coil around the throat and entwine the body, merging into one. Suddenly, fire arises within the three smokes, uniting with the inner radiance to refine the entire body. Within, the five viscera become luminous—this is the essential Way.\n\nThe previous method was slightly abridged, so it is restated here. Visualization must be thus. This is the study of deathlessness, though it does not yet reach the Dao of immortality. It may be practiced alongside other methods to dispel all evil, repel a thousand harms, and after thirty years of cultivation, conceal the form and hide the body, traveling five hundred *li* in a day.\n\nThis Way is rather humble. If pursued to its utmost, other practices cannot be undertaken simultaneously. Those of shallow capacity and limited destiny should adhere to this. It is not the pursuit of advanced scholars. If one wishes to guard *Xuanbai*, one should receive its scripture, which is brief. This *Xuanbai* has its own proper canon and should also have its invocations. What is recorded here is but an excerpt, much like the matters of *Xuan Zhen*.

      "translated_text": "The Master says: If one wishes to attain longevity, one must wash the face and purify the heart. When the sun has risen two *zhang*, and only after it has fully ascended, may this be practiced. Face the sun, exhale the dead qi from the mouth, and inhale the sun’s essence through the nose. When a sneeze is induced, cease—this is called the passage of qi. The mouth should always exhale the dead, turbid qi of the four seasons, while the nose draws in the essence of cinnabar clouds, stopping only when a sneeze naturally occurs. This method closely resembles the preceding one, though it lacks invocations. It is a means to replenish essence, restore the embryo, and attain longevity.\n\nThe Master says: To rectify the heart, one should begin when the sun has risen three *zhang*. After inducing the sneeze, repeat the practice. Cross the hands upon the shoulders, with the left hand above—this must not be mistaken. Let the sun align with the heart, so that the heart is centered directly toward the sun, and the sun, in turn, is envisioned as directly facing the heart. When warmth is felt within the heart, the heart is rectified. This warmth arises from the sun’s radiant essence entering the heart. It is excellent to practice this regularly. Some say that when the heart is not rectified, it is swiftly swayed by wayward affairs. Thus, the Perfected One instructs one to face the sun and observe it. Upon perceiving any deviation, this method is taught. In essence, it aligns with the principle of sunlight entering the heart.

      "translated_text": "The preceding entries, totaling nine matters, all pertain to the Dao of ingestion, exhalation and inhalation, and the visualization of mist and clouds.\n\n**Three entries of oral instructions transmitted by the Perfected Ones, comprising fifty-two matters in all.**\n*Master Deng’s Hidden Instructions on Ascending to Perfection, Scroll the Middle, concludes here.* #1 (Note: A character appears to be missing beneath 『名』.)\n\n---\n\n**Master Deng’s Hidden Instructions on Ascending to Perfection, Scroll the Lower**\n\n**Method for Reciting the *Yellow Court Scripture***\n**Method for Worship and Invocation**\n\nThe *Three-Nine Plain Speech Jade Essence True Instructions* states: The middle grade includes the *Three-Nine Plain Speech*, while the *Wei Transmissions* include the *Jade Essence True Instructions*. The *Three-Nine Plain Speech* likely refers to this scripture, though it has not circulated in the world. Spurious versions exist, but none contain these instructions.\n\nWhen reciting the *Eastern Florescence Jade Chapters of the Yellow Court Inner Radiance Scripture*, it is said to perform ten recitations and four bows. This scripture states, “At dawn, face the Supreme,” but here the three characters “face the Supreme” are omitted, and later it directs one to turn north to worship and invoke the Supreme. Does this not obscure the original intent? First, one pays homage to the Supreme Emperor, then turns north—yet the scripture’s preface contains no such instructions. It is said that the preface to the *Yellow Court* does not describe the method of paying homage. However, the fourteen characters within this scripture suffice to clarify the matter; why rely on an additional preface? Some commentaries suggest that upon reaching this point in recitation, one should face the four directions in homage—this, too, would require separate instructions. The present instructions for the *Yellow Court* derive from the *Plain Speech*, yet the high and low grades seem incongruous.\n\nThe Supreme Emperor resides in the east; thus, homage should be paid facing east. The Supreme Emperor is the Purple Dawn Lord. According to the *Entering the Dao and Gazing at Clouds*, one is to gaze southeast toward the Fusang and the Supreme Emperor amidst the Three Plain Flying Clouds. Moreover, the Fangzhu is located southeast of Kuaiji, while its northeast holds the Tang Valley. It is also said that Entering Stillness Mountain lies northeast of the Canglang, southeast of Penglai. Entering Ning Mountain is the abode governed by the Supreme Emperor. Furthermore, the Perfected Lord of Pure Emptiness, traveling east, crossed the Canglang at the Break of Dawn, ascended Broad Mulberry Mountain, entered the Court of First Radiance, and paid homage to the Supreme Emperor Lord. Thus, Fusang lies southeast of the Tang Valley, and from Jinling, it appears slightly south of due east. However, in the *Jade Register*, the Supreme Emperor bears no title of Purple Dawn. The present account contradicts these sources. If one must adhere to it, one should face due east. Therefore, when reciting the scripture, one faces east, and the instruction to first pay homage to the Supreme Emperor confirms its eastern location. Only afterward does one turn north to worship and invoke the Supreme. The Upper Clarity resides in the north, hence the scripture’s later directive to face north. One first performs the lighter act before proceeding to the weightier.\n\nUpon completing the ten recitations, rise and bow twice toward the Supreme Emperor. After bowing, kneel lengthily, close the eyes, and invoke:\n\n*“This humble servant [Name] respectfully recites the Golden Writ and Jade Scripture, which the Eastern Florescence calls the Jade Chapters. Now, invoking the Supreme Emperor, I refer to it as the Jade Scripture—is this not an overreach? Having completed ten cycles, I beseech to ascend the Dragon Plow. The scripture’s preface states that only after ten thousand recitations may one clearly perceive the five viscera, yet here, after a mere ten cycles, one begs to ascend the Dragon Plow—does this not defy the intent? This invocation is inferior to others, for from the outset it presumptuously seeks immortality and omits the required number of recitations. May the celestial spirits descend, command the Six Dings, cause my seven ancestors to ascend, and allow me to ascend to the Upper Clarity.”*\n\nYet the *Yellow Court* harmonizes the five viscera and refines the hun and po—it is not a method for ascending the seven ancestors. Moreover, the *Inner Yellow Court* merely ensures immortality; how could it enable ascent to the Upper Clarity? Furthermore, referring to oneself as “I” while addressing a superior violates the rites of humble supplication. The invocation to “fly and step” intermingles one’s name with “I,” a practice used when invoking stars to counter malevolent forces—not when directly addressing the Supreme Emperor.\n\nUpon finishing, open the eyes, swallow saliva ten times, and click the teeth nine times. If ten swallows constitute ten cycles, then the teeth-clicking should match. The meaning of nine cycles here is unclear.\n\nNext, turn north, bow twice, and kneel lengthily to invoke:\n\n*“Supreme August Perfect One, enable me to ascend to emptiness.” The Supreme August Perfect One is not an epithet of the Jade Dawn. “Enable me to ascend to emptiness” repeats the earlier error. In true methods of homage and invocation, only one’s name is used—there is no precedent for “your servant” or “I.” After purifying through fasting and refinement, reciting the Golden Writ, the Supreme calls it the *Zither-Heart Yellow Court*, yet here it speaks of Fusang—why do both invocations deviate? “May my seven ancestors disperse and ascend to the Emperor’s abode; after reciting the *Great Cavern* ten thousand times, may my seven ancestors attain immortality in the Nine Palaces.” Yet here, after reciting the *Yellow Court* ten times, one begs to attend the Emperor’s banquet—is this not excessive? “Prolong my years and preserve my existence; inscribe my name in the register.” First, one seeks to ascend to emptiness, then to prolong life—does this mean attaining high perfection only to revert to earthly immortality?\n\nUpon finishing, close the eyes, click the teeth nine times, and swallow saliva ten times. In the previous section, the eyes were opened; here, they are closed. The methods of clicking and swallowing are reversed, and though the two practices are not distinct, their postures differ. Taken as a whole, they violate true precedents. This likely stems from later students of shallow talent who established these methods arbitrarily, failing to distill the essence of the matter and thus introducing many contradictions. Successive generations have revered these deviations without scrutiny. For beginners who wish to follow them, no harm is done, but they do not align with my understanding. If one must observe them, they are not addressed in the true scriptures.\n\nAfter completing all rites, return to the usual recitation of the scripture.\n\n**Alternative Method for Visualizing the Spirits**\nThe Perfected Lord of Pure Emptiness states: In cultivating the *Yellow Court Inner Scripture*, one should follow the Dao of the Lord Emperor’s “Filling the Spirits and Blending the Mysterious True.”\n\nAccording to Master Pei’s studies and transmissions, nothing is lacking in the *Yellow Court* tradition. Yet this “Filling the Spirits and Blending the Mysterious True” is a spurious scripture of the present age, plagiarizing the method from the *Purple Capital’s Flame and Light Scroll*. Its descriptions of the spirits’ forms, lengths, invocations, and instructions are identical—thus, it compounds falsehood with further falsehood, a grave error.\n\nThe reason it is still included in this scroll is to prevent later students who may obtain it elsewhere from mistaking it for the true method. If they practice it diligently, believing it to be an essential instruction, they risk confusing the genuine with the spurious, leading to the loss of the true Dao. Therefore, its falsity is exposed here to awaken them.",

      "translated_text": "Upon completing the recitation and concluding the rites and invocations, sit upright facing east, close your eyes, and inwardly visualize the forms, colors, lengths, and sizes of the body’s spirits. Call their names and return them to their respective palaces.\n\nWithout practicing this method, even if one recites the scripture ten thousand times, the true spirits will not abide, and no efficacious response will arise. Instead, one will only deplete qi and exhaust the spirits, bringing no benefit to lifespan.\n\nThus, I have excerpted the essential passages from the scripture to demonstrate them.\n\nThe *Yellow Court*’s preface already fully records the methods of recitation. If these two matters remain unpracticed, there will be no efficacious response. Therefore, they must also be explained. Yet the text further discusses methods for averting fear, illness, and encounters with impurity, while entirely omitting the *Spirit Kings*.\n\nWould Master Wang truly not wish to provide clear and precise instructions? Given such omissions in the scripture, the principles remain incomplete, and there is nothing left to cultivate.\n\nSit upright, close your eyes, and knock the teeth thirty-six times. Then visualize the spirits. Since this is not a grand invocation to suppress evil, the subsequent practice of knocking the teeth thirty-six times (four sets of nine) and visualizing the spirits is absent from the scriptural examples.\n\nThe spirit of the hair, *Canghua*, is named *Taiyuan*, two inches and one *fen* in length.\nThe spirit of the brain, *Jinggen*, is named *Niwan*, one inch and two *fen* in length.\nThe spirit of the eyes, *Mingshang*, is named *Yingxuan*, three inches in length.\nThe spirit of the nose, *Yulong*, is named *Lingjian*, two inches and five *fen* in length.\nThe spirit of the ears, *Kongxian*, is named *Youtian*, three inches and one *fen* in length.\nThe spirit of the tongue, *Tongming*, is named *Zhenglun*, seven inches in length.\nThe spirit of the teeth, *Fenge*, is named *Luoqian*, one inch and five *fen* in length.\n\nThe seven spirits of the face above all wear purple robes and flying silk skirts, appearing in the form of infants. Visualize them clearly, arranged in order across the face, each returning to its palace.\n\nAccording to the scripture, there are seven names, but the eyes and ears are paired, making nine in total. This does not align with the *Eight Effulgences*, as each follows its respective location.\n\nThus, the scripture states: “The Nine Perfected of the *Niwan* all have chambers, each one inch square, dwelling within. Together they wear purple robes and flying silk garments.” These are the nine spirits mentioned earlier.\n\nIf this refers to the Nine Perfected of the nine palaces, then the purple robes and silk garments should not be mistaken. Those of discernment need only seek the truth in this, and they will naturally perceive the errors of true and false in the world.\n\nIt further states that they do not reside separately but all dwell within the brain, yet here they are described as arranged across the face—this contradicts the lengths of the five spirits of the hair, brain, eyes, nose, and tongue, which are plagiarized from the *Upper Effulgence* method. The spirits of the ears and teeth, which are absent there, are arbitrarily assigned measurements. How could the original author of this explanation dare to do such a thing?\n\nUpon completion, knock the teeth twenty-four times and swallow qi twelve times. These numbers again deviate from the principles of the seven spirits.\n\nInvoke:\n“Scattered qi of the numinous origin, coalescing qi to form spirits,\nDistinguishing front and back, governing the *Niwan* in unity,\nAbove and below supporting one another, the seven spirits arrayed,\nFlowing forms following transformation, nurturing the source of radiance,\nGuiding the eight numina, ascending through the cavernous gate,\nGuarding the body, treading the effulgence, ascending to the imperial dawn.”\n\nThis invocation is modeled after the *Eight Effulgences*, yet the spirits of the *Eight Effulgences* belong to the *Middle Effulgence* method of the *Shangqing* tradition. How can one now seek to guide them while subordinating the high to the low?\n\nNext, visualize the spirit of the heart, *Danyuan*, named *Shouling*, nine inches in length, wearing a red brocade flying skirt.\nThe spirit of the lungs, *Haohua*, named *Xucheng*, eight inches in length, dressed in white brocade with a yellow sash.\nThe spirit of the liver, *Longyan*, named *Hanming*, seven inches in length, wearing a green brocade cloak.\nThe spirit of the kidneys, *Xuanming*, named *Yuying*, three inches and six *fen* in length, clad in dark brocade.\nThe spirit of the spleen, *Changzai*, named *Hunting*, seven inches and three *fen* in length, wearing yellow brocade.\nThe spirit of the gallbladder, *Longyao*, named *Weiming*, three inches and six *fen* in length, dressed in nine-colored brocade with a green floral skirt.\n\nAll these garments are derived directly from the names in the original scripture. The lengths of the spirits also follow the *Middle Effulgence* tradition, though the gallbladder is reduced by one *fen* and the liver by one inch, presumably to indicate their difference.\n\nThe true spirits of the six bowels reside within the palaces of the five viscera and six bowels. Here, however, only the five viscera’s spirits are listed, with the gallbladder being the sole bowel mentioned. What is meant by “the true spirits of the six bowels residing within the five viscera”?\n\nThe scripture’s reference to the six bowels is a general designation, with no specific mention of their spirit-palaces. Moreover, the scripture states that they all circulate the *Heavenly Scripture* within the heart, so they cannot each reside within the palaces of the five viscera and six bowels.\n\nLater in the scripture, the six locations are further clarified—some as spirits, some as youths—with three upper and three middle, each displaying distinct attire and adornments. They are not all confined to the spirits of the five viscera.\n\nAppearing like infants, their colors like radiant youths, visualize them clearly, arranged in order within a single form. Such an arrangement starkly contradicts the claim that they all reside within the heart.\n\nKnock the teeth twenty-four times and swallow qi twelve times. Invoke:\n“The five viscera and six bowels, the true spirits return as one,\nTogether governing the *Crimson Palace*, above and below following,\nThe golden chamber’s red child, facing the four portals,\nThe dark chamber’s mysterious gate, the spirit-hall’s pivotal mechanism,\nBlending transformation to generate spirits, true qi refined,\nPreserving and binding the *Cinnabar Field*, shining with the sun’s radiance,\nAttaining union with the *Eight Effulgences*, merging forms to ascend and fly.”\n\nAccording to the twenty-four spirits, each of the five viscera and six bowels nurtures its own spirit. Here, however, the viscera and bowels are conflated, described as returning as one—this is a contradiction in practice.\n\nMoreover, the *Three Elders of the Hall of Light* are all clearly described in the scripture, with the middle section serving as the primary master of the *Yellow Court*. Yet here, none are visualized or invoked. How can one claim to employ visualization to ascend into the void?\n\nThe *Purple Tenuity* states: “In the past, Meng Guang recited the *Yellow Court* and practiced this method for eighteen years. The Perfected of the *Yellow Court* descended to her, but when she sought among the immortals—male and female—there was no Meng Guang. Only Liang Hong’s wife was called Meng Guang.”\n\nAfter reciting ten thousand times, the *Yellow Flower Jade Maiden* should reveal her feelings to you.\n\nWho, then, is this Perfected of the *Yellow Court*?",

      "translated_text": "Should the *Primordial Sovereign of the Lower Realm* deign to descend and appear alone, how could one lightly establish such a doctrine? To speak thus today is to entangle the net of principles—may future disciples take this as a profound warning. Here ends the secret transmission of the *Yellow Court*.\n\nThe spirits within the body may be contemplated from dawn to dusk, ever held in mind without forgetfulness; one need not wait for the recitation of scripture. Guard this well.\n\nThe rites of obeisance and the two methods of spirit visualization recorded here were both transmitted through mental transmission. From the Eastern Jin onward, no written record of them has existed. If secrecy were truly required, the crudeness and shallowness of these words and matters would reveal them as the fabrications of boastful and competitive impostors, who cobbled together this spurious scripture. I have recorded them here merely to distinguish truth from falsehood.\n\nComparing the two, the earlier section on rites of obeisance is slightly superior, while this text on spirit visualization is so convoluted, redundant, and vulgar as to risk misleading later students—its harm is not insignificant. If my judgment here is deemed incorrect, I invite all to seek out the authentic text and present it. Should such a text indeed exist, I shall seal my lips and bind my tongue, never again daring to speak of the study of the Dao.\n\n---\n\n**Entering Stillness**\nOral transmission from the *Orthodox Unity Perfected Realized One*, the *Three Heavens Master* Zhang [Daoling], to the *Lady of Southern Marchmount*.\n\nWhen the *Celestial Master* taught this transmission in Yangluo, the Lady had already immersed herself in the recitation of the *Cavern Scriptures* and mastered the manifold subtleties. Yet he still condescended to impart this minor art of the *Great Clarity*. Some in the world claim this was because the Lady had once served as a *Libationer*—but though she once held that office, it is no longer relevant today. Why then speak of it?\n\nSince this transmission was entrusted to the *Celestial Master*, and the Lady was bound by the duty to instruct those below, it was set forth for the world to guide the officials of *Orthodox Unity*. Moreover, those of low rank may not instruct the lofty perfected; thus, the title of *Libationer* is explicitly retained to clarify its connection.\n\nEvery word and phrase of the *Perfected Realized One* carries profound meaning. Only through meticulous discernment can one grasp its principles. Merely reciting and bowing without seeking to comprehend its divisions is like burying gold in the earth—what use is that?\n\nThe chapter on *Entering Stillness* and the methods for memorializing and treating illness are indeed among the highest canons of solemn authority, not to be casually overheard by careless *Libationers*.\n\n---\n\n**Method of Entering Stillness**\nThis text does not clearly state the meaning of *entering stillness*. Later, it mentions that one may dispense with ordinary morning and evening practices, suggesting that these refer to morning and evening obeisances, prostrations, supplications, or the submission of memorials. When treating illness, one should first perform these rites before proceeding with other matters.\n\nAccording to the transmission from *Lady Yi Qian*, one should \"morning and evening hold the heart in reverent stillness.\" This seems to prescribe the use of this method. If illness prevents physical performance, one may instead hold the heart in reverent stillness. Even those dwelling in mountains or living in the world may practice this. Though the language here is humble, it is intended for officials of this age, not necessarily for those who now dwell in mountain retreats.\n\nThose who maintain long fasts and abstain from grains, devoting themselves to lofty practices, need not physically attend but should hold their hearts in reverence without fail. As for the later method of the *Two Audiences*, it states that one should first perform the *Audience of Stillness* before proceeding. At the time, the Lady was still alive; how could she have already exhausted the teachings of Yangluo? If she had already received the *Judgment*, she should not have used it again later—there must have been a separate method for the *Audience of Stillness*.\n\nThere exists an ancient text on *Grain Paper* from Hanzhong, titled *Method of Entering Governance and Audience of Stillness*, which likely refers to this. Since we are now fortunate to possess this [transmission], we should employ it. If one also uses the Hanzhong method, only the words of the opening and closing incense rites need slight adjustment.\n\nFor morning and evening *entering stillness*, use the times of sunrise and sunset. These are not the moments when the sun is seen to rise or set, but rather the beginning of its passage through the *Circular Net*. If making a petition, use the hour of midnight, for the workings of the spirits are profound, and the *Perfected Realized One* rarely descends during the day.\n\nWhen first entering the chamber of stillness, gaze at the incense burner and silently recite: The *Southern Perfected* said: \"Hold the breath and bow in stillness, so that the hundred ghosts stand in awe. The *Merit Officers* and *Messengers*, the *Dragon* and *Tiger Lords*, may then appear and speak with you.\" This refers to holding the breath and visualizing at the outset, then reciting the incense prayer, exhaling, holding the breath again, and bowing to the four directions. After each direction, exhale.\n\nIt is further instructed: When entering the chamber of stillness, first step forward with the right foot, then bring the left foot forward to align with it. Only then proceed as usual, so that one’s petition may be clearly heard above.\n\nThis instruction likely applies not only to entering the eastern-facing chamber of stillness but to all places of petition. For matters of communicating with the unseen, the right foot should lead.\n\nIt is also said: When burning incense, do not look back, for to do so would offend the *true qi* and invite demonic responses. This means that once inside the chamber of stillness, one must not turn the head to look behind. However, if one turns to face outward directly, there should be no harm.\n\nAfter the *Two Audiences*, it is again stated: When exiting the chamber of stillness, do not look back, for to do so would offend the *true light* and invite insincerity. Thus, both entering and exiting the chamber of stillness forbid looking back.\n\nIt is further said: Do not call out to those outside or speak of other matters while in the chamber. Both entering and exiting require rinsing the mouth.\n\nThe intent here is that all officials and attendants within the chamber of stillness belong to the *Supreme Clarity* bureaucracy, where scrutiny is strict and regulations numerous. Failure to comply not only prevents resonance but may also invite misfortune and harm.\n\nNow, I set forth the proper sequence for *entering stillness* as follows:\n\nFirst, bathe and bind the sash to the east, comb the hair, arrange the garments, and ensure the headcloth and shoes are pure. Hold the tablet in both hands, without wrapping it in paper. Upon reaching the chamber door, rinse the mouth three times, hold the breath, step forward with the right foot, then bring the left foot forward to align with it, and stand evenly. Calm the heart and direct the gaze inward, visualizing the *Straightforward Messenger*, the *Orthodox Unity Merit Officers*, and the *Left and Right Official Messengers*—four in total—standing to either side within the chamber. The *Dragon Lord* stands to the left, the *Tiger Lord* to the right, with two *Incense-Bearing Messengers* flanking the incense burner, and the *Jade Maiden Guardians of Stillness* attending the desk. Once all are visualized, exhale, open the eyes, gaze directly at the incense burner, and silently recite:",

      "translated_text": "The Most High Mysterious Origin Five Numinous Venerable Lord, summon the Merit Officers and Messengers, the Left and Right Dragon and Tiger Lords, the Incense-Bearing Messengers, the Three Qi Orthodox Spirits, and those who perform the Two Audiences—may clouds gather and the Scripture-Attending Divine Lads and Jade Maidens draw near.\n\nHasten to report to the Three Heavens’ Most High Mysterious Origin Dao Lord, and memorialize the Supreme Clarity Palace. I now burn incense, enter stillness, and present myself before the spirits, practicing the Eastern Florescence esoteric method. From the ninetieth day after my life-origin day, at dawn, I enter stillness to present myself before the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity. From the one hundred eighty-second day after my birth month, at midnight, I enter stillness to present myself before the Most High Lofty Sage Lord. May the Eight Directions’ Orthodox Qi enter my body, and may my petition swiftly ascend to the presence of the Emperor.\n\nBefore the Jade Tower and Purple Palace of the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity, beneath the Jasper Tower of the Most High Lofty Sage Lord.\n\nOnce done, burn incense and proceed. Exhale, advance the right foot to the incense burner, then bring the left foot forward to align with it. With the left hand, take three pinches of incense and burn them abundantly. As the Two Audiences are said to begin with silent audience, the incantation at the incense burner should not be limited to the silent audience but adapted to the occasion, roughly following the vermilion annotations for alternating use.\n\nAfter burning the incense, first withdraw the right foot, then bring the left foot back to align with it. Observe the rising smoke, hold the breath, and bow. Initially, bow twice. This is called the Bow of Stillness, and the method of stillness naturally requires facing east. Upon first entering and reciting at the incense burner, one faces west, so it is not reiterated here.\n\nPlace a square mat in the center of the stillness chamber, with one incense burner and one incense box, facing all four directions. Later, if entering stillness due to illness, burn incense in all four directions, arranging four incense burners. Place four incense mats at the four sides, each not touching the walls. Enter the center and bow in sequence. Upon first entering, recite at the incense burner within the chamber, facing west. Then enter the center and burn incense in all four directions, concluding with a single recitation facing west.\n\nIf the scripture hall faces south, this method cannot be used, and there are no Merit Officers, Dragon or Tiger Lords—only the Scripture-Attending Divine Lads and Jade Maidens. If presenting oneself before the Most High Primordial Noon Attainment, one may remain in the scripture hall.\n\nAfter completing the dawn and dusk Bows of Stillness, return before the scriptures, burn incense again, and invoke the host of Perfected Ones, seeking immortality and the fulfillment of wishes. Other petitions to the Celestial Emperor, requests to officials for healing, disaster eradication, or blessings—all are conducted within stillness.\n\nAfter bowing, strike the chest three times, then bow four times in total. Kneel and place the tablet before oneself. Strike the chest with both hands, then take up the tablet again, stating one’s name (male or female), and solemnly report:\n\nI humbly report to the Heavenly Master, the Female Master, and the Lineage Master—the Three Masters—and to the Attending Officers and Clerks of the Gate. May I receive the Orthodox Unity Three Qi to nourish my form and spirit, causing the Five Viscera to flourish and the Six Palaces to flow freely. May the disasters of the four directions be dispelled, the calamities of seven generations dissolved, and may I attain long life and enduring vision, becoming a flying immortal.\n\nConclude with two more bows. Before the Han dynasty, there were also Heavenly Masters—likely three in number, including one woman, though not necessarily kin.\n\nThe Orthodox Unity Qi is rooted in the Master, so one first bows and invokes them, then faces north. The initial two bows with chest-striking express grief and supplication; the subsequent two bows express gratitude for virtue. In all such cases, the order of bowing follows the intent of the matter.\n\nNext, face north and bow twice, striking the chest three times, and say:\n\nI humbly report to the Supreme August Most High Northern Great Dao Lord. I, a flesh-born mortal and withered-bone descendant, beseech the erasure of the thousand sins and myriad transgressions—hidden evils and offenses against the Three Officials—accumulated from seven generations past to my present self. May fortune arise in the five directions, calamities vanish in the nine yin, and no hundred ghosts or wayward spirits dare oppose me. May I envision divine immortals and jade maidens descending, attaining long life and enduring vision, my lifespan equaling the Three Luminaries.\n\nConclude with two more bows. The Northern Great Dao Lord is the most exalted Perfected of the Grand Clarity, so one bows to them after paying respects to the Master.\n\nNext, face east and bow twice, striking the chest three times, and say:\n\nI humbly report to the Grand Clarity Mysterious Origin Most High Three Heavens Boundless Great Dao, the Most High Venerable Lord, the Most High Elder, the Celestial Emperor, the Celestial Elder, the Nine Elders of the Immortal Capital, the Nine Qi Elder, the myriad layers of Dao Qi, the Twelve Hundred Official Lords, and the Jade Court of the Grand Clarity. May my heart open and my mind awaken, my ears and eyes grow keen, and the myriad immortals convene in council to bestow upon me the Jade Elixir. May disasters be dispelled, calamities averted, and immortality attained. May my worldly rank be noble, golden chariots enter my gate, and all slanderous misfortunes—thousands of calamities and myriad afflictions—be eradicated at once. May my record in the Three Offices be expunged, and may I receive the grace of the Three Heavens’ Elder.\n\nConclude with two more bows. These Grand Clarity Official Lords govern the fortunes and misfortunes of all beings as the rightful stewards of the Three Heavens, so one bows to them next.\n\nNext, face south and bow twice, striking the chest three times, and say:\n\nI humbly report to the Southern Great Dao Lord. May my name be inscribed in the Jade Register of Divine Immortals and announced to the various Lords of Destiny, securing long life as my fate. May the Ten Thousand Blessings Lord of the Three Heavens be commanded to bring treasures from the four directions and silks and grains from the eight, amassing boundless wealth. May my meritorious deeds be enacted, all endeavors succeed, and every wish be fulfilled as if by the work of my own hands. May I attain long life and immortality, my lifespan equaling heaven and earth.\n\n[Note: The character *sheng* (生) was originally *jiu* (久), later altered to *sheng*; here, it should follow the original meaning of \"long-lasting.\"]\n\nConclude with two more bows. This is the Grand Clarity’s Southern Dao Lord, whose rank is inferior to the Northern Great Dao Lord, hence lacking the august title of Supreme August Most High. Thus, one bows to them last. There are thirty-six such Lords, and this one ranks among the lesser.",

      "translated_text": "First face east and declare: \"May I, Jia, rejoice in life and delight in vitality. I humbly beseech the Lords and Elders of all directions to grant me long life and enduring vision, to prolong my years and augment my longevity, that I may become one of the seed-people and abide with Heaven and Earth. May the disasters and misfortunes of Jia’s household be dispelled, all illnesses healed of themselves, divine luminaries attach to my body, and my heart open with enlightened understanding.\"\n\nNext face north: \"I, Jia, desire to turn from evil toward goodness. I humbly beseech the Supreme Mystery’s Most Exalted One to pardon my transgressions, absolve my karmic retributions, deliver me from calamities, and repel the clutches of worldly authorities. May all I face yield like metal and stone, water and fire be extinguished, malevolent rebels submit, and pernicious spirits disperse.\"\n\nThen face west: \"I, Jia, delight in the Dao and rejoice in immortality. I humbly beseech the Heavenly Master to grant what I desire and fulfill what I undertake. May my heart open and understanding deepen, my ears and eyes grow keen, all illnesses vanish, and my body become light and strong.\"\n\nFinally face south: \"I, Jia, cultivate the body and nurture my nature, seeking to return to youth and reverse aging. I humbly beseech the Lord of Virtue and Dao to bestow the qi of gracious moisture upon my bones and frame, that the qi of the Dao may flow freely. May my entire being be enveloped in compassionate favor, all illnesses dispelled, and blessings and fortune gather. I entreat the Lord of Myriad Fortunes to bring wealth from all directions, advancing my livelihood and increasing my gains, that all I pursue may come to fruition.\"\n\nThis is the text for the four directional audiences, known as the *Rightward Progression Method*, identical to that described in the Purple Gate, though without prescribed sequence. The prayers at the incense burner for the four directions share a similar essence, though their substance is somewhat less refined than what follows.\n\n**Petitions and Talismans**\nFor urgent matters requiring a petition, use cinnabar to inscribe the heading. In cases of sudden illness, disaster, or pressing concerns—such as invoking the Heavenly Prosperity Lord and others to submit a petition for deliverance—write in cinnabar: \"By the authority of the Orthodox Unity of the Great Clarity, the Celestial Master [Name], the Master of Qi and Libationer, your servant [Name].\" Below, in smaller script, add the servant’s surname and affiliation, followed by the year, month, and day under the Three Heavenly Bureaus. Once this cinnabar heading is affixed, the petition may be submitted. This is akin to the red-marked talismans used by officials for urgent matters today.\n\nTo submit a petition for expelling ghosts, inscribe the name of the libationer to whom it is addressed. For households plagued by malevolent and powerful ghosts, invoke the Rightward Immortal Lord of Aerial Qi and others to drive them away. The petitioner need not use cinnabar for the heading but may simply write: \"Submitted by Libationer [Name] of [Place], your servant [Surname].\"\n\nFor petitions to treat demonic illnesses, use blue paper, as the Three Officials’ demon-quelling officers favor this color. For afflictions caused by licentious or demonic qi, or by spirits haunting temples and shrines, invoke the Heavenly Equilibrium Lord and others to subdue them. The petition should be written in cinnabar on blue paper, which may be cut into strips according to the number of copies needed.\n\nFor illnesses caused by qi-inflicting ghosts, compose a *Striking Ghost Petition*. For households troubled by vengeful ghosts from ancestral tombs, litigation, or untimely deaths, invoke the Four Hu Generals of the High Granary and others to attack and disperse them. Once the petition is complete, grind it with two *fen* of pure cinnabar (equivalent to one modern *liang*). Combine the ground petition with honey to form pills, which should be taken all at once in the early morning while facing north after bowing twice. Even those on the brink of death may be revived. The grinding and mixing must be done in secret, lest the patient’s hun-soul be disturbed and ghostly qi dare to interfere. This method may also be applied to other illnesses.\n\nIf the patient is capable, they should grind and mix the pills themselves; otherwise, the libationer submitting the petition may do so. First soak the paper in honey to soften it, then grind it thoroughly into pills. The petition itself should not exceed two sheets, and the resulting pills will not be numerous. They must be taken in one dose, washed down with clear water, and not divided into multiple servings. While this method is particularly effective for striking ghosts, it may also be used for other ailments.\n\nWhen composing a petition, use separate brushes and inkstones, avoiding contamination. Even the ink should be distinct. However, brushes and inkstones used for copying scriptures may be shared without issue, provided they are not used for mundane correspondence.\n\nWhen grinding ink, rotate the inkstick counterclockwise forty-nine times and stop. Repeat the grinding process forty-nine times. The counterclockwise motion follows the celestial sequence, beginning in the east. The number forty-nine corresponds to the *Dayan* method of divination with milfoil stalks, enabling communication with the unseen and the divine. This practice reflects the meticulous precision required in Daoist study, where every action aligns with cosmic patterns—far from being a casual endeavor.\n\nWhen writing a petition, burn incense and face north. Use fine paper and brushes, ensuring all utensils—cloths, desks, and other implements—are clean and cool. Wear the sash on the left, sit reverently, and write with care. The ink’s consistency and the brush’s strokes should be well-balanced. Seal the petition in an envelope with paste and submit it according to the proper method.\n\nCurrently, there is no standardized template for petitions, and many are carelessly edited by libationers, rendering them unreliable for use. One should adhere to the *Rituals of the Twelve Hundred Officials*, selecting the appropriate deities from the twenty-four officials based on the matter at hand. Begin by detailing the root of the affliction, then confess transgressions and acknowledge faults before invoking the officials for deliverance, keeping the tone humble. If offerings such as gold foil, blue paper, or oil are required, specify the quantities and list the names of the summoned officers and soldiers, avoiding ambiguity. The petition should not include vague promises of offerings; the same applies to verbal declarations.\n\nFor suspended offerings, deliver them promptly upon the resolution of the matter, presenting the specified items. These offerings should be distributed to the Celestial Master, dispersed among mountain-dwelling scholars, or used for Daoist purposes. They must not be appropriated for personal use, such as clothing or food, as the Three Officials scrutinize such matters closely.\n\nAccording to the Lesser Lord, for households experiencing illness, death, misfortune, strange phenomena, disturbing dreams, or financial decline, exorcism may be performed.

      "translated_text": "It is further stated that one may submit a memorial regarding tomb disputes, and I shall petition on their behalf.\n\nMaster Fan Zhonghou also said: Therefore, one should earnestly submit memorials concerning *fengzhu* (wind-inflicted) tomb disputes. These instructions were given to the Xu family, and even the Xu family, with their meritorious works, still regard tomb disputes as urgent matters—how much more so for ordinary people? When such memorials are submitted with proper reasoning, they will surely bring profound benefit.\n\nYet today, not only are the memorials poorly composed, but it is also difficult to find a qualified *jijiu* (libationer). Hasty submissions are like casting words into the void, only inviting further transgressions and malevolent influences.\n\nThe essence of tomb dispute memorials need not exceed two or three sheets of paper, yet in the world, they have expanded to dozens. I fear that all memorials, talismans, and the like follow this pattern.\n\nThe rites for summoning officials originally derive from the ancient methods of Hanzhong. For healing illnesses, miscellaneous matters, and all memorial submissions, one may only summon the *gongcao* (functionaries), *lishi* (clerks), and *bing* (soldiers) from the immortal registers one bears, as well as the local *zhen’guan* (true officials) and *zhengshen* (orthodox deities). Yet people today universally employ the generals, clerks, and soldiers from the Yellow and Red Inner Registers—how can these be properly invoked? They merely seek grandeur in numbers, heedless of the transgression of overstepping their authority. This blind adherence, passed down through generations, has become standard practice—truly lamentable.\n\nDuring the Taixing era of the Jin, I once saw the memorial drafts of Li Dong, the *jijiu* of Qu’a, which were concise yet precise in their wording and matters. Later practitioners, however, omitted reverence to the Supreme Lord (*Taishang*) and the Three Heavenly Bureaus of the *Yin-Yang* Judges, instead invoking the Lords of Dragon-Tiger and citing reign titles of emperors past, omitting the Tai Sui (Year Star). These were all correct practices.\n\nYet in today’s memorials, the fine print omits the Supreme Dao Lord (*Taishang Daojun*) and fails to face north, addressing only the various officials of the Great Clarity. How then can one claim reverence for the Supreme Lord? Other discrepancies abound, but I shall not enumerate them all.\n\nLi Dong was a talented *jijiu*, and thus was appointed as a master in the underworld, initially ranked in the first tier. He has since been promoted, so his methods may still be followed. He frequently submitted memorials on behalf of the Xu family, which is why the Central Lord (*Zhongjun*) mentioned him.\n\nIf one enters seclusion due to illness, burn incense on all four sides and place four incense burners. This is for the time of prostrating and verbally petitioning the four directions for aid—it is not the method for submitting memorials. The proper method for memorials requires facing only east.\n\nThe procedures for setting up the altar have already been noted earlier.\n\nFor major matters, one may report merits of three or four hundred; for those on the verge of death, merits of five hundred; for minor matters, one or two suffice. Excessive claims will provoke the displeasure of the *qi*-governing functionaries and weary the summoned officials.\n\nThis refers to submitting memorials or verbal petitions to the various lords, generals, clerks, soldiers, and the *gongcao* officials within one’s own body to resolve a particular matter. Upon the matter’s resolution, one enters seclusion to report these merits and petition the Three Heavenly Registrars to confer ranks accordingly.\n\nIf one initially submits a memorial, subsequent merit reports must also be in memorial form; if one initially makes a verbal petition, subsequent merit reports must likewise be verbal. Mixing the two will cause the Heavenly Bureaus to find discrepancies in their records, resulting in punishment. The number of merits reported should correspond to the gravity of the matter, ranging from one or two up to fifty, a hundred, or even four or five hundred, as appropriate. Each should be measured with sincerity.\n\nWhen writing talismans, one must first purify oneself through ablution before proceeding. Face the monthly branch, hold the breath, and write.\n\nThe method for writing talismans: first outline the four sides with green ink, then write the talismanic text within in red. If green ink is unavailable, red may be used instead. This describes the method for emergency talismans, but all talismans should generally follow this approach.\n\nGreen ink is made by finely grinding *kongqing* (azurite), mixing it with thick glue and water to form pellets, and drying them in the sun. When needed, grind them as one would ink.\n\nFor talismans to treat demonic illnesses, use tiger bone and cinnabar, ground together. After grinding, dip the brush and write the talisman. Tiger bone should first be pounded into fine powder, sifted through double-layered silk, then mixed with cinnabar in a ratio of two parts cinnabar to three parts bone, combined with glue and water, and used to write the talisman. All talismans for repelling ghosts should follow this method.\n\nThis talisman-writing method originally appeared after the section on emergency talismans. It has been excerpted here to accompany the discussion of memorials, though it does not follow the original order.\n\n**Requesting Officials**\nFor urgent matters requiring a memorial, one may request the Yellow-Clad Soldiers of the Heavenly Prosperity Lord (*Tianchang Jun*), numbering one hundred thousand. Alternatively, one may enter seclusion, face east, and verbally petition them to capture the one hundred and twenty inauspicious and monstrous beings within and beyond the household, as well as the twelve *xing* (punitive) and *sha* (killing) ghosts.\n\n\"Urgent matters\" refer to sudden crises, not merely illnesses. Household misfortunes, calamities, and illnesses all stem from tomb disputes, so these officials are commanded to capture the various harms within the tomb.\n\nThis verbal petition facing east should follow the structure of a memorial, with a complete beginning and end, differing only in the absence of paper and ink. People today call this a \"verbal memorial.\" In the second fascicle of the *One Thousand Two Hundred Official Rites*, it states that for nightmares and confusion, one should request the Yellow-Clad Soldiers of the Heavenly Prosperity Lord, one hundred thousand in number, to capture the one hundred and twenty inauspicious and monstrous beings within and beyond the household, as well as the twelve *xing* and *sha* ghosts, and eradicate all that disturb one’s dreams. The rites for robes and other items are as described, so the character for \"tomb\" (*zhong*) should be written as \"household\" (*jia*), as twenty characters appear to have been omitted.\n\nThe names and titles of the palaces and bureaus responsible for various matters often differ slightly. All are written in red and recorded accordingly. This sequence is still drawn from the *Official Rites*, though with minor variations. The *Official Rites* lack the latter Three Officials, and I do not know how this came to be. The *Official Rites* have been transmitted for a long time, and errors in transcription have led to doubts about certain characters for some officials. Nevertheless, one may still rely on them for reference, as in the case of resolving misfortunes through *yunqi* (cosmic cycles). It is clear that this transmission has omissions.\n\nFor afflictions of the face, submit a memorial or enter seclusion to request the Five Heavenly Bright Lords (*Tianming Jun*) and one hundred twenty officials and generals under the Southern Palace (*Nanji Gong*), who govern illnesses of the face.",

      "translated_text": "Generally, when it is said that [the officials] reside in the various palaces, this refers to the palaces of the Three Qi of the Great Clarity (*Taiqing*), the bureaus to which afflictions and misfortunes are traced, and the offices through which lords and officials operate. Thus, they are first summoned to their respective palaces before descending to administer treatment.\n\nWhen it speaks of \"five lords\" (*jun wu ren*), this refers to their shared governance with one hundred twenty officials and generals. When it simply says \"lord\" (*jun*), this denotes a single individual.\n\nThe *Rites* state: For a man suffering from pain in both eyes, invoke the Five Heavenly Bright Lords (*Tianming Jun*), along with one hundred twenty officials and generals under the Southern Palace (*Nanji Gong*), who also govern the left eye. For a woman suffering from pain, invoke the Five Earthly Bright Lords (*Diming Jun*), along with one hundred twenty officials and generals under the Northern Palace (*Beili Gong*), who also govern the right eye. Offerings of silk, grain, and coin are to be made.\n\nFor coughing, counterflow of qi, upward surging breath, vomiting, or diarrhea of green, yellow, red, or white [substances], or for the six kinds of *gu* poison and *chi* demons, invoke the Great Mechanism Lord (*Daji Jun*) of the Northern Palace, along with one hundred twenty officials and generals under the Supreme Balance Palace (*Taiheng Gong*). These *wen* poisons and *ba* demons encompass epidemic and pestilential illnesses, as well as wind-malaria and various afflictions, all of which arise from them.\n\nThe *Rites* state: For chest pain and fullness, upward surging breath, and coughing, invoke the Great Mechanism Lord of the Northern Palace and one hundred twenty officials and generals to administer treatment at the Supreme Balance Palace, expelling the six *ba* demons of the five *wen* poisons through vomiting and diarrhea. Offerings of brooms, paper, and brushes are to be made.\n\nFor distension and fullness in the chest and abdomen, urgency and cramping in the lower abdomen, or the twelve diseases of vaginal discharge, invoke the Sealed Separation Lord (*Fengli Jun*) to administer treatment. The diseases of vaginal discharge afflict not only women but men as well. All twelve conditions below the waist and in the yin regions are included.\n\nThe *Rites* state: For distension and fullness in the chest and abdomen, cramping and sharp pain below the navel, invoke the Twelve Sealed Separation Lords to govern the twelve diseases of vaginal discharge in men and women. Offerings of grain are to be made.\n\nFor undigested food in the abdomen, persistent hardness, or unceasing dripping discharge, submit a memorial or make an oral petition, and invoke the Red Essence Lord (*Chisu Jun*) and one hundred twenty officials and generals to administer treatment. This refers to abdominal masses and obstructions that harm digestion, or long-standing dripping discharge.\n\nWhen it says \"make an oral petition\" (*qi shi*), this means facing east and verbally petitioning, having first completed the four directions’ obeisance. This is done before invoking the matter, though it is not as formal as submitting a memorial.\n\nThe *Rites* state: For undigested food in the abdomen, persistent hardness, or unceasing dripping discharge, invoke the Red Essence Lord, along with one hundred twenty officials and generals, to administer treatment at the Six *Wu* Palace (*Liuwu Gong*). For women, invoke the White Essence Lord (*Baisu Jun*) and one hundred twenty officials and generals to administer treatment at the Yin Palace (*Yin Gong*). Offerings of grain are to be made according to the *Rites*.\n\nVolume Three, Part One also states: The Five Essence Lords, along with one hundred twenty officials and generals, administer treatment at the Upper Numinous Palace (*Shangling Gong*), governing all illnesses of men and enabling the writing of petitions. The Five White Essence Lords, along with one hundred twenty officials and generals, administer treatment at the Yang Brightness Palace (*Yangming Gong*), governing all illnesses of women and enabling the writing of petitions. Here, the names are the same, but the functions differ.\n\nFor counterflow of qi causing constriction and urgency, or the inability to retain food in the abdomen, submit a memorial or make an oral petition, and invoke the Five Celestial Balance Lords (*Wuheng Jun*) of the Celestial Bureau, along with one hundred twenty officials and generals under the Supreme Peace Palace (*Taiping Gong*), to administer treatment. This encompasses all qi-related illnesses, including leg qi, running piglet, and coughing.\n\nThough the subsequent passages no longer mention submitting memorials or making oral petitions—omitted for brevity—they remain unchanged in substance.\n\nThe *Rites* state: For inability to retain food or drink, or qi constricting the abdomen, invoke the Five Celestial Balance Lords of the Celestial Bureau and one hundred twenty officials and generals to administer treatment at the Supreme Peace Palace. Offerings of grain, clothing, paper, and brushes are to be made.\n\nFor severe vomiting and diarrhea, invoke the Five Celestial Balance Lords of the Earthly Bureau, along with one hundred twenty officials and generals under the Supreme Peace Palace, to administer treatment. This governs sudden vomiting and diarrhea, as well as chronic diarrhea, including cholera.\n\nThe *Rites* state: For a woman’s counterflow vomiting, invoke the Five Celestial Balance Lords of the Earthly Bureau and one hundred twenty officials and generals to administer treatment at the Supreme Peace Palace. Offerings are the same as above.\n\nWhen the *Rites* mention officials with \"Celestial\" or \"Earthly\" in their names, this distinguishes their governance over men and women.\n\nFor distension, fullness, and sharp pain in the lower abdomen, invoke the Nine Rivers and Northern Sea Lords (*Jiuhe Beihai Jun*), along with one hundred twenty officials and generals at the River Gate Palace (*Hedui Gong*), to administer protection and treatment. This governs all conditions of lower abdominal blockage, distension, and obstruction, as well as lip swelling. Simply petition this lord to command the officials and generals to administer treatment.\n\nThe *Rites* state: For lower abdominal distension and fullness, invoke the Nine Rivers and Four Seas Lords, along with one hundred twenty officials and generals, to administer treatment at the River Gate Palace, governing distension, fullness, and joint obstruction. Offerings of clothing, salt, and ritual implements are to be made.\n\nFor illnesses caused by well and hearth ghosts (*jing chong gui*), invoke the Five Kings of the Law (*Wangfa Jun*), along with one hundred twenty officials and generals at the Five Surnames Palace (*Wuxing Gong*), to subdue and eliminate them. This refers to afflictions from offending well and hearth spirits, seeking divination or knowledge, or illness caused by offerings of food and drink. This lord governs their treatment.\n\nThe *Rites* state: For offenses against the hearth ghost... [text corrupt].\n\nFor carbuncles, abscesses, and malignant sores, invoke the Nine Assembled Lords (*Jiuji Jun*), along with one hundred twenty officials and generals at the Former Kings’ Palace (*Xianwang Gong*), to descend and administer treatment. This also governs all sores. It further governs wounds from metal, fire, or bites from dogs, horses, snakes, and insects.\n\nThe *Rites* state: For sores, carbuncles, and abscesses on the head, face, eyes, or body, invoke the Five Kings of the Law, along with one hundred twenty officials and generals, to administer treatment at the Five Surnames Palace. Also invoke the Nine Marquises Lord (*Jiuhou Jun*), along with one hundred twenty officials and generals, to administer treatment at the Former Kings’ Palace. Offerings of miscellaneous clothing, grain, paper, and brushes are to be made.\n\nHere, the Kings of the Law are distinguished as governing well and hearth ghosts, which differs from the above. Yet the *Rites* also state that carbuncles, abscesses, and malignant sores arise from offenses against the twelve hearth ghosts. Thus, these illnesses are not separate from those caused by well and hearth spirits.\n\nFor emaciation, bone wasting, and flesh depletion leading to exhaustion, invoke the Celestial Bureau’s Yang Order Lord (*Yangzhi Jun*), along with one hundred twenty officials and generals and one hundred twenty left and right attendants, to administer treatment.

To suppress and eradicate strong, lingering ghosts that bring spectral afflictions, offer provisions for their service.\n\nThe fourteen officials, detailed in the first scroll, govern the limits of all illnesses. To repel residual *qi*, sever spectral influxes, avert death and invite life, and transform misfortune into fortune, invoke the Heaven-Covering Great General (*Gai Tian Da Jiangjun*) with one hundred thousand troops to capture and restrain them.\n\nWhen a household is burdened by lingering *qi* of deceased ancestors that remain unresolved, continuing to bring influxes, harm, and misfortune, the *Rites* state: The Heaven-Covering Great General with one hundred thousand troops governs the capture of all wandering and malevolent ghosts that afflict the people through food and drink. This is the sole official and ritual recorded in the third scroll.\n\nAcross the eight scrolls, only the first includes offerings; the rest are incomplete. If one wishes to establish offerings, they may follow the prescribed model.\n\nTo capture and restrain the various ancient spirits that invade households, invoke the Supreme Primordial Noble Lords (*Wu Shang Yuan Shi Jun*) with five attendants and one hundred twenty officials and generals. Between Heaven and Earth, there exist all manner of ancient spirits capable of transformations and invasions, demanding sacrifices from households—these should be captured and restrained.\n\nThe *Rites* state: The Supreme Primordial Noble Lords with five attendants and one hundred twenty officials and generals govern the capture of all ancient spirits,杂神, and self-proclaimed officials that harm the people.\n\nIf divination reveals that an illness is caused by conflicts with one’s year of fate, life destiny, the Earth’s dominion, the tomb’s cyclical phase, or the constructive and destructive forces of the calendar, invoke the Earth-Restraining Lords (*Zhi Di Jun*) with five attendants and one hundred twenty officials and generals to govern the Palace of Appropriate Springs, suppressing and dissolving these influences. Unless one is a transcendent of the highest order, all face the declines and adversities of fate, as well as the consequences of their actions. To resolve conflicts with the Earth’s dominion, the *qi* of the tomb’s cyclical phase, the constructive and destructive forces of the calendar, and other taboos—all of which lead to illness—these must be dissolved.\n\nThe *Rites* state: The Earth-Restraining Lords with five attendants and one hundred twenty officials and generals govern the Palace of Appropriate Springs, capturing all ghosts of high and low merit, as well as those tied to the Earth Deity of one’s year of fate and life destiny.\n\nIf a household is troubled by litigious ghosts or unrighteous *qi*, causing unrest, invoke the Four Hu Lords (*Si Hu Jun*) with five attendants and one hundred twenty officials and generals to dissolve and sever them. This refers to ancestral misfortunes that linger, causing descendants to suffer repeated setbacks and instability. Such cases require only dissolution and severance, not eradication, for these are the workings of karmic misfortune, and descendants must not act with defiance. Many such precedents exist.\n\nThe *Rites* state: The Four Hu Lords with five attendants and one hundred twenty officials and generals govern the regulation of ancestral sacrifices, the pacification of households, the suppression of unrighteous *qi*, the resolution of litigious conflicts, and the separation of purity from impurity.\n\nIf a household is afflicted by recurrent deaths, spectral influxes, and bodily harm from punishments, invoke the *Qi*-Resolving Calamity-Averting Lord (*Yun Qi Jie E Jun*) with one hundred thousand troops to govern the matter. When a household suffers the lingering influxes of deceased parents, siblings, or spouses, which then afflict the living with bodily harm and lead to death, this must be addressed. According to the *One Thousand Two Hundred Officials*, there exists a *Qi*-Resolving Calamity-Averting Lord; here, the character for \"calamity\" is omitted, so it is not presumptuous to add it.\n\nThe *Rites* state: The *Qi*-Resolving Calamity-Averting Lord with one hundred thousand troops governs the capture of illness-causing ghosts, repelling and suppressing the destructive forces of the twelve punishments, the one hundred twenty spectral influxes, and other malevolent ghosts. There is also a *Qi*-Resolving Calamity-Averting Lord with five attendants who governs their capture and suppression.\n\nIf a household is haunted by the ghosts of the Five Tombs, causing harm and death to visitors, invoke the Supreme High Granary Lord (*Wu Shang Gao Cang Jun*) with one hundred thousand troops to capture and govern them. According to the *Tomb Records*, there are five types of burials—those by water, fire, weapons, concealment, or exposure—but these are not called the Five Tombs. Here, it likely refers to the Five Tombs of the Five Tones and Surnames. Some dead remain unburied, becoming malevolent spirits that bring misfortune, harm, and the extinction of descendants—these should be captured and governed.\n\nThe *Rites* state: The Supreme High Granary Lord with one hundred thousand troops governs the capture of ancestral ghosts of the Five Tombs that afflict descendants.\n\nIf a household suffers from recurrent influxes of water and fire, invoke the Supreme Heavenly Lord (*Wu Shang Tian Jun*) with one hundred thousand troops to sever them. When a household is plagued by the officials of water and fire, causing illnesses that lead to death—all stemming from the same source and spreading contagiously across generations without end—these must be severed.\n\nThe *Rites* state: The Supreme Heavenly Lord with one hundred thousand troops governs the capture of the one hundred twenty spectral influxes residing within the living, averting death and inviting life. It is also said: The Supreme Heavenly Lord of Life with one hundred thousand troops governs the capture of the one hundred twenty spectral influxes, as well as ghosts of harm, punishment, and execution. Some texts refer to the Supreme Heavenly Noble Lord or the Supreme Heavenly Peaceful Lord, but their governance is the same.\n\nTo break and dispel the ghosts and malevolent entities haunting ancestral halls, seats, and bedding, invoke the Heaven-Pacifying Lord (*Ping Tian Jun*) with one hundred twenty officials and generals to govern the Palace of Heavenly Prosperity and address the matter.",

      "translated_text": "Those who once followed heretical customs but now submit to the royal transformation should destroy and dismantle their ancestral halls and seats, abolishing all sacrificial and supplicatory rites. Yet afterward, if they suffer afflictions, misfortune, or illness due to lingering malevolence, or if their village or city harbors altars where shamans receive offerings, bringing harm to the people—\n\nThe *Rites* state: The Heaven-Pacifying Lord, with one hundred twenty officials and generals governing the Palace of Heavenly Prosperity, dispatches troops to seize the demonic spirits of the Five Prisons, the rebellious qi, and the ghosts of perverse offerings.\n\nThere are twenty-two such officials in total, all drawn from the *One Thousand Two Hundred Official Rites*, each with slightly differing duties. When submitting petitions, one should seek their aid from both sources.\n\nFor those who aspire to immortality yet suffer from chronic illness, persistent afflictions, or stagnation, invoke the Red-Clad Army of the Void-Pure Heavenly Essence Lord, one hundred thousand strong, stationed in the Palace of the Heavenly Pillar, to suppress ghosts, eradicate misfortune, and repel the qi of the Six Heavens.\n\nThose who wholeheartedly devote themselves to the pursuit of the Dao of immortality may find the numinous ghosts of the Six Heavens repeatedly assaulting them—bringing illness, imprisonment, or gradual impoverishment, often provoking misfortune. Thus, it is imperative to swiftly suppress and restrain them.\n\nIf a household is plagued by malevolent ghosts that refuse to disperse and continue to bring misfortune, invoke the Red Heavenly Lord of Qi-Consumption, with one hundred twenty officials and generals, to govern the matter. This refers to cases where, despite prior exorcisms, the evil spirits persist in their incursions, causing disasters and hauntings.\n\nIf a household experiences constant turmoil, chaotic nightmares, or the loss of soul and spirit, invoke the Luminous Lord of Spirit-Seizing, with one hundred twenty officials and generals, to govern the matter. When a family endures perpetual hardship, every action fraught with difficulty, dreams filled with ominous disturbances, and the mind and body unsettled—leading to gradual decline—this marks the onset of decay, and urgent intervention is required.\n\nThe *Rites* do not record the names or duties of these two lords; their inclusion here may stem from recent revelations by the Heavenly Master. They are equally essential—simply invoke them according to their designated roles. When submitting petitions, it is also advisable to draw from the corresponding officials in the *One Thousand Two Hundred Official Rites*, rather than relying solely on these twenty-five.\n\nThe above constitutes the oral instructions of the Orthodox Unity tradition, the essential teachings for curing illness and subduing ghosts, corresponding to the twenty-four spirits and the Three Palaces within the body. Though twenty-five official titles are listed here, the count of twenty-four spirits accounts for one official governing the obscure spirit of the root extremity, making the twenty-fifth. These spirits interact harmoniously, yet not all can be strictly aligned with the Three Palaces—they correspond instead to the Twenty-Four Spirits of the Eight Luminous Palaces, not the Three Ones.\n\nThe numbers of officials, generals, and soldiers arise from the Daoist tripartite qi responding to circumstances, not from beings born of Heaven and Earth. They coalesce from qi, assume form through symbolic representation, and manifest in response to invocation, lacking fixed substance. They are not beings conceived through mortal birth or attainable through ordinary Daoist practice. Their emergence stems from the profound sincerity that penetrates the void, shaping phenomena into tangible form—thus, qi is transformed into these officials and soldiers.\n\nThe qi of the Great Clarity responds boundlessly. Though one speaks of the Limitless Dao in its myriad layers, its limits remain unattainable. In summary, these manifestations interconnect, not existing in vain. While their principles can be grasped, they defy exhaustive description. The immortal and numinous officials and generals all belong to this category.\n\nThe remaining official titles are recorded in the *One Thousand Two Hundred Official Rites*, which are interlinked and supplementary. They do not align as distinctly with the twenty-four bodily spirits as these twenty-four titles do. The *One Thousand Two Hundred Official Rites* originated in Hanzhong and have circulated through the ages, accumulating variations over time. While some of these twenty-four titles may overlap with those in the *Rites*, the authenticity of this text remains unquestioned, having been recently revealed. Thus, not only those who recognize the true path should employ them—even the Alliance-Weapon Libationers must adhere to this method, though it lies beyond the comprehension of ordinary talent.\n\nIn urgent matters, invoke the appropriate officials as needed—their efficacy is immediate. They may be summoned through petition or by entering stillness, burning incense, and orally invoking the four directions. Earlier instructions specified facing east when making oral requests; here, invoking the four directions allows for flexibility. However, when composing petitions or following household rituals, one should still face east. After bowing and concluding the prayer, one may verbally plead for assistance.\n\nThe phrase \"corresponding to the twenty-four spirits within the body\" implies that these spirits resonate with every person, not just oneself. Unlike the method of spirit visualization, which cannot be performed for others, this approach allows even those in critical condition—such as the gravely ill or dying—to be aided by others. For all preceding matters, personal invocation is preferable. Petitions and oral requests may be made as circumstances permit. Written petitions cannot encompass every detail and are less effective than directly invoking the four directions. For grave matters, one should vow to offer specific items upon fulfillment, following the previously outlined methods.\n\nMatters not covered by the Great Clarity’s petitions or vows—those derived from authentic scriptures outside this framework—are governed by separate esoteric principles and cannot be lightly discussed. Such distinctions, though discussed in writing, are ultimately matters of inner realization.\n\nThe two morning audiences span ninety days. The later text states that the count begins from one’s *benming* day. For this method, one must retroactively determine the first *benming* day following birth, then count forward ninety days, marking each cycle. The current practice should commence at dawn on the *benming* day corresponding to this cycle.",

      "translated_text": "Should an individual be born on the thirtieth day of the fourth month in the *bingshen* year of the third *Xiaojian* reign of the Song (a *jiayin* day), the first *benming* day would fall on the thirteenth day of the sixth month, a *bingshen* day. The *bingshen* day of the thirteenth day of the eighth month, however, has already passed in void, no longer serving as the initial *benming* day. Each *bingshen* day recurs at sixty-day intervals; the present method spans ninety days, thus extending thirty days beyond this cycle. If one were to arbitrarily select a *bingshen* day as the starting point, mistakenly taking a void occurrence as the first, it would not be the true initial *benming* day. Such an error would lead to perpetual misalignment, causing no small harm.\n\nFrom the preceding *bingshen* day to the twenty-second day of the twelfth month in the *guiyou* year (a *bingshen* day), this marks the seventy-seventh cycle. Commencing the audience from this point, one counts forward ninety days to the dawn of the twenty-first day of the third month in the *jiaxu* year (a *bingyin* day) for the next audience. The following day, a *dingmao* day, begins the next count, culminating in another audience at dawn on the ninetieth day, a *bingshen* day. Thus, each *bingyin* day alternates with a *bingshen* day. If the audience is to span ninety days, one would instead use *yichou* and *yiwei* days.\n\nIn a single year, there may be three or four audiences, with no fixed number. Should one be unaware of the year and month of birth, the current year’s *benming* day may serve as the starting point.\n\nAt dawn, one enters stillness and burns incense before sunrise. This method requires quietude; thus, it is said that incense should first be burned during the morning audience in stillness. If incense has already been burned, it is now burned again while facing west. Since the present rite requires facing north, one must adjust the mechanism to face north directly and burn incense again, avoiding oblique placement beside the censer.\n\nFacing north, one offers audience to the Celestial Thearch of the Grand Tenuity. The count begins from the *benming* day.\n\nThis means that the first audience commences on the *benming* day, and after ninety days, the next audience follows. Once the incense is burned, one remains in prolonged kneeling, visualizing oneself suddenly beneath the Jade Tower of the Grand Tenuity, in the presence of the Celestial Thearch. There, one focuses the mind, regulates the *qi*, and offers the invocation:\n\nThe humble and lowly servant, so-and-so, respectfully bows twice and offers audience before the Jade Tower and Purple Palace of the Celestial Thearch of the Grand Tenuity. May so-and-so attain long life as a divine immortal, fulfill all desires, and accomplish every endeavor. May the Registrar of Destinies inscribe this on the Purple Tablet and record it in the Jade Emperor’s register, that I may become a paragon among beings.\n\nThe \"Registrar of Destinies\" mentioned here does not refer to the Registrars of the southern direction invoked in prior morning audiences but rather to the present overseer governing the Wu and Yue regions.\n\nUpon completion, one bows twice again.",

      "translated_text": "Then, the phrase \"thereafter bow twice again\" refers solely to this final prostration. After burning incense facing north, one simply kneels in reverence; upon completing the invocation, one bows twice more. When finished, one turns the incense burner to face west. Once the incense offering is fully concluded, two audiences should be held. At such times, two incense burners may be positioned, and there is no need to revert to the original arrangement.\n\nFirst, one must perform the audience in quiescence, then proceed with this rite. Both methods are termed \"entering quiescence,\" hence the instruction to perform the quiescent audience first. The present audience is of the highest order, yet it is said to precede the quiescent audience because one must ensure that the spirit attending the incense, who bears witness to one’s sincerity, presents one’s words truthfully before the Two Thearchs.\n\nThe method for the quiescent audience has not been detailed in extant texts; it follows the procedure described above. If practiced for eighteen years, the Celestial Tenuity will inscribe one’s name in the *Divine Record of Efficacy*, ensuring immortality—this is an esoteric method of the inner Dao. The audience before the Celestial Tenuity is the reason the Celestial Tenuity records one’s name.\n\nThe count of one hundred eighty-two days begins on the day of one’s birth within the birth month, referring to the numerical day within the lunar month, not the cyclical signs of *jia-yi* or *zi-chou*. One must consult the extended calendar, beginning the count from the day of birth and marking each one hundred eighty-two-day period as a single cycle. This count continues until the present year’s total is fulfilled; one may not simply take the current year’s birth month and day as the starting point.\n\nFor example, if one was born on the thirtieth day of the fourth month in the year *bing-shen*, counting one hundred eighty-two days brings one to the fourth day of the eleventh month, with the first audience occurring at midnight. By the present year, *gui-you*, the seventy-sixth audience would begin on the sixth day of the tenth month. The cyclical signs must be calculated with a consistent interval of one celestial stem between each audience; any error will lead to miscalculation. If the previous audience fell on *jia-zi*, the next should be on *bing-yin*, followed by *wu-chen*, and so on, ad infinitum.\n\nThe method for calculating these two audiences is derived from my own contemplation and reasoning; no scholar has yet grasped its subtleties. There exists another secret formula for determining the days, received through the profound decree of the Mysterious Principle, which cannot be disclosed here. A detailed discussion of this matter is contained in the third scroll.\n\nThe audience should take place at midnight, between the hours of *hai* and *zi*. Facing north, one burns incense and addresses the Supreme Jade Dawn Lord of the Dao. Kneeling, one offers the invocation, with all visualization practices resembling the previous method. Here, the phrase \"humble and lowly servant\" is omitted, as one dare not describe oneself with such self-deprecation before the Supreme High Sage.\n\nThe five characters \"Supreme High Sage Lord\" first invoke the title of the Supreme, then state the name, a mark of utmost reverence. The humble servant so-and-so respectfully bows twice beneath the Jasper Tower and offers this plea: may the Registrar of Destinies be commanded to inscribe my name in the register of long life, that all my aspirations and desires may be fulfilled, all things accomplished, and that I may ascend as a divine immortal, soaring freely to feast in the Nine Heavens.\n\nUpon completing the invocation, one bows twice more and withdraws. For both rites, one must fast and don proper attire for a full day beforehand. Whether in the world or in the mountains, one must first purify oneself for a day, bathing and donning fresh, clean garments.\n\nThe audience before the Supreme should begin on the day of one’s birth within the birth month, meaning one commences the rite at midnight on that day, with the calculation method as previously described. If one does not know the birth month or day, one may use the cyclical sign of the birth year as the starting day. For instance, if one’s birth year is *jia-zi*, the first audience occurs on *jia-zi*, and after one hundred eighty-two days, the next falls on *yi-chou*, followed by *ding-mao* after another count, and so on, always maintaining an interval of one celestial stem. If one does not know the birth year, one may begin on the first day of the first month.\n\nIf both birth details are unknown, there is no reliable standard; one may then take the current year in which the audience is to be performed and begin at midnight on the first day of the first month, counting one hundred eighty-two days to the second day of the seventh month, adjusting for the shorter months to complete the count. The next audience follows, and by tracking the cyclical signs, the sequence continues indefinitely. This method resembles the calendrical systems of the Xiongnu or foreign lands and may be used as a makeshift solution, though it falls far short of precise calculation.\n\nIf practiced for eighteen years, the Supreme will command the Registrar of Destinies to inscribe one’s name on the divine tablet, recording one’s attainment of long life. This audience before the Supreme is why the Supreme issues the command. Both methods require eighteen years of practice, placing them in the category of middle-grade scriptures. Through continuous practice, one will no longer suffer illness and will repel water, fire, and the five weapons.\n\nThis refers to the period after beginning these two audiences, when one gains the power to avert all calamities. If some practitioners remain vulnerable to misfortune, it is due to errors in their calculations, not adhering to the method described above. Consuming *qingjing* grain also prevents illness and disaster, aligning with these practices.\n\nThis is the esoteric method of the Eastern Flower Azure Palace, one of the various techniques for seeking immortality, though it is not practiced by those of that tradition. For those with ample resources, these two rites should be performed separately, entering quiescence and offering audience in dedicated attire, not to be mixed with other garments.\n\nFor all morning and evening audiences in quiescence, one should wear distinct clothing—this applies not only to these two rites. When studying in the mountains, one’s daily attire, including headscarves and coarse robes, may be worn for mundane tasks, but they are unsuitable for audiences with the loftiest perfected beings. One must prepare a separate set of garments. The phrase \"those with ample resources\" refers to the need for proper vestments, including outer and inner robes, skirts, and undergarments, all made specifically for these rites, not merely ritual robes. For those who cannot afford such provisions, garments should be laundered to ensure purity when the time comes.\n\nThe Perfected Lord of Pure Emptiness addressed the Lady, saying: The previous method was also taught by Lord Wang, a general explanation of the practices of the Eastern Palace, not a discussion confined to a single text or individual. The present instruction, however, is specifically intended to guide the Lady in her cultivation, hence the emphasis on the Pure Emptiness method.\n\nThese two practices are the esoteric methods to be followed in the world, for they repel all disasters. As the world is fraught with misfortunes, they are all the more worthy of practice. One does not cultivate the Dao yet attain it spontaneously; through diligent practice and the accumulation of years, one may ascend to immortality. Thus it is said.",

May the Registrar of Destinies inscribe this on the Purple Tablet and record it in the Jade Emperor’s register, that I may become a paragon among beings.\n\nThe \"Registrar of Destinies\" mentioned here does not refer to the Registrars of the southern direction invoked in prior morning audiences but rather to the present overseer governing the Wu and Yue regions.\n\nUpon completion, one bows twice again.",

      "translated_text": "The Lady, having received and applied these teachings, spoke this line herself in pure contemplation: since she dwelled in an age of chaos, traversing lands beset by war and banditry, she deemed the practices all the more necessary and thus embraced them at once. As for matters that might arise later, she would not be obliged to adhere to them strictly—hence this interjection was made.\n\nWhenever entering stillness, one must rinse the mouth with water to cleanse impure qi, for daily speech, laughter, idle chatter, or residual breath from food and drink are unfit to address the perfected spirits; thus, one must wash and purify through ablution. Upon exiting stillness, one must also rinse the mouth to seal the Three Palaces. When entering stillness to pray and bow before the deities of the Three Palaces, who assist in presenting one’s petitions, all such communications pass through the mouth. Once the ritual is complete, water is used to cleanse, allowing the spirits to return to their palaces and settle in tranquility. This water should be placed beside the door: upon first entering, one rinses before crossing the threshold, and upon retreating, one rinses before fully exiting.\n\nThe phrase \"each time one enters or exits\" refers specifically to occasions when one enters stillness to present petitions or perform morning and evening rites. For tasks such as sweeping or tidying, one need only rinse upon initial entry; no rinsing is required upon departure.\n\nWhen exiting the chamber of stillness, one must not look back, lest one offend the radiance of the perfected spirits and appear insincere. Having left the chamber and allowed the spirits to rest, to suddenly glance back would resemble prying or surveillance, thus offending the perfected and betraying reverence.\n\nIt is further stated that when burning incense, one must not look back, for in all human endeavors—whether mundane or esoteric—looking back is forbidden.\n\nUpon first entering the chamber of stillness, one must not summon outsiders or engage in extraneous speech, lest one violate the numinous qi and forfeit auspiciousness. Whenever entering stillness to burn incense, one must focus the mind upon the perfected spirits and harbor a sincere wish. To call out to others or entertain distracting thoughts would inwardly harm the abode of the spirit and outwardly disrupt the numinous order, inviting divine censure and summoning misfortune. The signs of auspiciousness would naturally recede.\n\nAll necessities for stillness should be prepared in advance; to lack them at the moment of need and then summon others is the mark of an unrefined practitioner, unworthy of consideration. Though these may seem minor matters, they demand utmost caution.\n\nThe five precepts above, though trifling in the context of the method, may bring no small calamity if neglected; thus, the practitioner is urged to observe these prohibitions carefully. While these instructions were conveyed by Lord Wang, they pertain to the household laws of the Great Clarity. Later Heavenly Masters did not expound upon them, as the Lady was already familiar with them.\n\nHere end the five transmitted precepts of the Wei tradition.\nThe *Hidden Instructions on Ascending to Perfection*, Scroll the Lower, concludes.",
