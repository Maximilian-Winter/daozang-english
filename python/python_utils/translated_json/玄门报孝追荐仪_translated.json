  "full_translation": "**Daoist Rite for Filial Piety and Deliverance of the Departed**\n*Scripture Title:* *Daoist Rite for Filial Piety and Deliverance of the Departed*. One fascicle.\n*Source:* *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Dongxuan Section, Category of Ritual Propriety.\n\n---\n\n**Daoist Rite for Filial Piety and Deliverance of the Departed**\n\n**Natural Audience and Procession of the Dao**\nThe master’s hall is arranged in proper order.\n*Stepping in Void*\n*Invoking the Master*\n\nWith reverence, we acknowledge that the Golden Perfected expound the teachings, widely disseminating the scriptures of deliverance and salvation; the Jade Registers transmit the ordinances, abundantly setting forth the methods of ascent and transcendence. Both the living and the dead depend upon them, and the hidden and manifest realms alike receive their blessings. Thus, the Eastern Pole extends its compassion for the suffering, and the Northern Dipper establishes the bureau for the deliverance of the departed, enabling lost souls to receive salvation and withered bones to live again. Presumptuously, we approach the august and solemn, humbly beseeching your witness and validation.\n\nWe reverently consider the Masters of the Dao within the Mysterious Realm, whose teachings span the Three Powers, whose hearts embrace the myriad forms. Adapting their teachings to all directions, they respond to beings with fluid manifestations, serving as the bridge between life and death and governing the hidden and dark realms. We, your humble servant, a mere speck in the vastness of the floating kalpas, a fleeting life in the Lingbao tradition, have presumptuously ascended the ladder of the boundless Perfected and been granted the guidance of the Masters of the Mysterious Realm, to deliver the hidden and stagnant and to benefit beings and aid humanity.\n\nToday, we earnestly act on behalf of the petitioner, ever mindful of the departed souls, boundless in their suffering. From past lives to this present existence, they have accumulated myriad transgressions and countless faults—sins committed in the yang realm and offenses hidden in the yin. Their crimes violate the Azure Laws, and their names are recorded in the Black Books. Confined in the cold courts, imprisoned in the dark prisons—if they do not turn and submit to the Jade Steps, how can they be summoned to the Imperial Altar? We dare to knock our heads before the Celestial Might, humbly beseeching compassion for the hidden and stagnant.\n\nWe prostrate ourselves in sincere devotion, disturbing the Azure Mystery on high, and implore the descent of your grace and light to illuminate the darkness. May the true compassion draw them forth, and may the sagely virtue show mercy. Proclaim the talismanic commands at the River Source, transforming the sword trees into jade trees; issue the Red Writs in the prisons, turning the knife mountains into treasure mountains. May the radiant light of wisdom shine brightly, fulfilling the vows of great compassion, dispelling the endless night and illuminating the hidden paths. Thus, may the departed souls equally attain the fruits of the Dao, escape the retributions of the Nine Springs, and ascend to the immortal realms in carefree wandering.\n\nWe look up to receive the mysterious grace, that it may soon be manifestly repaid. Yet our humble devotion cannot fully express the sincerity of our prayers. Leading the assembly, we ascend the altar and reverently perform the ritual forms.\n\n*Chanting the Dao*\n*Ascending the Altar*\n\n*Chanting the Incense Hymn*\nEach bows to the masters, holding the contemplation in accordance with the Dharma.\nThe Mysterious Yin and Seven Numinous Ones unite with the Nine Qi to form a single body.\nThe ethereal soul and corporeal spirit, the Two Radiant Ones, revolve in harmony.\nFlying light blazes resplendently, illuminating the Eternal Spring.\nSun and moon emit their brilliance, converging in the flowering splendor.\nThe Great Brahmā’s flow spreads forth, fire bells soaring in flight.\nDemon kings receive their charge, journeying to pay homage at the Imperial Capital.\nAll sentient beings are universally succored, vast grace bestowed upon the hidden and dark.\nJade scriptures are proclaimed, the myriad qi ascending in tumult.\n\nHarmony unites with the Dao in truth.\n*Strike the Dharma Drum twenty-four times*\n\nThe Most High Three Heavens, Primordial Origin, Three Qi, Supreme Dao Lord—\nSummon forth the Three and Five Merit Officers, the left and right attendants within our bodies,\nthe Golden Lads of Incense, the Jade Maidens of Transmission,\nthe Thirty-Six Perfected of the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans and Daily Incense Officials.\nLet those who emerge don their solemn attire, open the sacred altar’s gates,\nand the local earth deities and true officials of the domain.\n\nWe now ascend the altar in proper form, offering incense and performing the Dao rites.\nReverently, we act on behalf of the petitioner’s intent, all sincerities recorded and presented above.\nMay the numinous radiance of Jade Clarity’s Dao qi and the wondrous light of the Numinous Treasure\nflow into our bodies, that the sincerity of our entreaty swiftly reach\nthe presence of the Supreme, Boundless, and Great Dao;\nthe Merciful Father of the Eastern Culmen, the Azure Mystery, the Great Unity, the Heavenly Worthy of Salvation from Suffering.\n\n*Proclaiming the Dharma Titles*\nThe humble petitioner, [Name], together with disciple [Name], jointly and sincerely address:\nThe Supreme, Boundless, and Great Dao, the Self-So and Natural Primordial Heavenly Worthy;\nthe Supreme Dao Lord, the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy;\nthe Supreme Lord Lao, the Heavenly Worthy of Dao and Virtue;\nthe August Jade Emperor of the Highest Heavens;\nthe Celestial Sovereign of the Upper Palace of the Curved Array;\nthe Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity of the Central Heaven and Northern Culmen;\nthe Great Emperor of the Eastern Culmen and Azure Brilliance;\nthe August Earth Deity, the August Thearch of the Earth;\nthe perfected and sagely hosts of the ten directions who have attained the Dao;\nthe Lords and Elders of the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinosity, and Northern Perfection;\nthe Luminous Sovereign of the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace in the Jade Capital of the Mysterious Metropolis;\nthe Supreme Ministers, Supreme Stewards, Supreme Protectors, and Supreme Instructors;\nthe Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures;\nthe Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center;\nthe Five Thearchs and Three Officials;\nthe Four Departments and Nine Bureaus;\nthe ranked true lords of the Nine Heavenly Courts;\nthe divine and sagely assemblies of the Earth Prisons, Water Offices, Five Marchmounts, Four Waterways, famous mountains, and grotto-heavens;\nthe officials and retinues of the Three Realms;\nall majestic and numinous beings—\nwe beseech your vast compassion, deign to look upon us with penetrating insight.\n\nWe have heard: the sages of antiquity harmonized their virtue with Heaven and Earth,\nand aligned their order with the four seasons.\nGreat indeed is the practice of filial piety.\n\nAs for the sun and moon, they lend it their brilliance; the kingly Dao, they bring it to fulfillment. Master Lan received its teachings from the Dipper Perfected, while Mother Shen transmitted its scriptures to the Grand Scribe. Thus, the rites of Pure Brightness root the heart in loyalty to the sovereign and filial piety to kin; the Fast of the Covenant with the Real founds its teaching on repaying ancestors and recommending kin. From this we see that those who study immortality—how could they not devote themselves wholeheartedly to their parents? To claim they sever Heaven’s constant bonds is but the self-serving argument of Confucians. If one examines the Daoist canons, how could one not recognize the great filial piety of the Heavenly Perfected?\n\nI, your humble servant, though of common talent, have presumptuously taken part in the study of the Mysteries. I uphold the scriptural ordinances to enlighten and transform, and wear the precepts and disciplines to cultivate through burning incense. Though I have left form and abandoned wisdom to merge with the Great Thoroughfare—even so, I take up the words of Yan Yuan. In revering the dead and pursuing the distant, I return to profundity, ever mindful of the expansive sayings of Zengzi. As a fellow disciple, my resolve is earnest in recommending my kin. As a libationer, duty compels me to present this petition. Ascending and descending at your side, I am fortunate to gaze upon the majestic radiance of the Imperial Perfected. Filial piety and fraternal duty reach the gods; luminous clarity discerns the human. For this humble request of mine, since I have received your gracious assent, how dare I not make it known above?\n\nProclamation of the Petition:\nFollowing the words of the petition, I have exhausted all sincerity and earnestness. Looking up, I beseech the Great Dao; looking down, I pray for your discernment of my humble heart.\n\nI have heard: the people are born of the Three, yet serve them as one. The Dao emerges from the One, yet its teachings divide into Three. Thus, to serve the sovereign as one serves the father is to fulfill the meaning of loyalty and filial piety; to govern the state as one governs the self is to perfect the transformation of purity and stillness. Among those who dwell in the Real, none esteem more highly than repaying the sovereign. Therefore, the Wondrous Precepts of the Nine Perfected take reverent diligence as the gateway to virtue; the Fundamental Ordinances of the Three Registers take burning incense and cultivation as the intent of praying for blessings. The origins of this teaching are ancient; those who study it should take it as their model.\n\nToday, as we ascend the altar to perform the Dao, the assembled ritualists and I now offer the first pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke rise to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Treasure of the Utmost Real and Perfect Dao. We prostrate ourselves, our heads touching the earth, and take refuge in the Three Honored Ones of the Most High and the sacred assemblies of the Ten Directions. With this merit, we pray above for the emperor’s sacred longevity and eternal peace.\n\nMay the Dao align with the Mysterious Sage, and virtue match August Heaven. May the Mandate favor the virtuous with prosperity, and the ancestral altars extend ten thousand years of felicity. Without action, may the people transform themselves; may Huaxia and the barbarians return to the unity of a single realm.\n\nNow, therefore, we burn incense, taking refuge in the virtue of the Dao-Honored, the Great Sacred Assemblies, and the Perfected of the Utmost Real. After attaining the Dao, may we harmoniously preserve Heaven’s enduring existence.\n\nI have heard: humans originate from their ancestors; filial piety begins with one’s parents. According to the ritual classics, beyond the seven ancestral temples and the two remote shrines, others are not included in the seasonal sacrifices. Yet by the Daoist scriptures, even a hundred thousand generations of ancestors should be included in the rites of recommendation and deliverance. For there are those among the long-departed who have not received deliverance and thus cannot attain immortality, just as there are those who, having failed to sacrifice to their ancestors in past lives, still bear the burden of sin. Thus, the *Nüqing Prohibitions* contain passages on redemption and deliverance, while the *Fundamental Chapters of the Numinous Treasure* place the rites of posthumous deliverance at their head. For Daoist cultivators, this is the foremost duty. Therefore, the Heavenly Worthy established the teaching with clear instructions.\n\nToday, as we ascend the altar to perform the Dao, the assembled ritualists and I now offer the second pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke rise to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Treasure of the Utmost Real and Perfect Scriptures. We prostrate ourselves, our heads touching the earth, and look up to the Three Honored Ones of the Most High and the sacred assemblies of the Ten Directions. With this merit, may it flow back to repay filial devotion.\n\nMay the disciple [Name], both clerical and lay, along with the primordial ancestors and past generations of their lineage, bathe in this good merit and together ascend to the immortal realms. May the edicts of the Three Realms descend with the crane-tallied decrees, and may the Nine Dark Prisons receive the grace of the dragon tablets. Rooted in remembrance of their ancestral origins, may they swiftly be delivered from the Yellow Springs’ registry; merging transformations to return to the Primal One, may their spirits immediately ascend to the Vermilion Fire Palace.\n\nNow, therefore, we burn incense, taking refuge in the virtue of the Scripture-Honored, the Great Sacred Assemblies, and the Perfected of the Utmost Real. After attaining the Dao, may we harmoniously ascend into the formless.\n\nI have heard: vast and subtle, the Way of the noble person can be transmitted; toilsome nurturing and rearing, the kindness of parents knows no greater weight. All who possess blood and qi at least know to employ their feelings; how could those who contemplate the Dao forget their roots? For there are those who in life failed to express their devotion, and in death still yearn to make offerings. Master Wang honored his parents by following the *Original Conduct of the Jade Emperor*; his aspirations were ultimately fulfilled. The son of the Mo family recited the *Hidden Scriptures of the Azure Empyrean* to deliver his mother; he ultimately succeeded. Gazing upon the radiance of these former worthies, later people should take them as a bright mirror.\n\nToday, as we ascend the altar to perform the Dao, the assembled ritualists and I now offer the third pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke rise to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Treasure of the Utmost Real and Perfect Masters. We prostrate ourselves, our heads touching the earth, and look up to the Three Honored Ones of the Most High and the sacred assemblies of the Ten Directions. With this merit, may it directly serve the disciple [Name] in delivering the departed spirit of [Name], enabling them to depart the dark paths and ascend to the immortal realms.\n\nMay they ride the merit of the Three Transformations and Five Refinements, escaping the suffering of the Nine Nights’ dense darkness. May they consume flying roots to generate jade nectar, swiftly wandering the halls of the Great Vast; may they chew numinous mushrooms and sip golden springs, immediately soaring to the halls of the Grotto Yang.\n\nNow, therefore, we burn incense, taking refuge in the virtue of the Master-Honored, the Great Sacred Assemblies, and the Perfected of the Utmost Real. After attaining the Dao, may we harmoniously ascend into the formless.\n\nRitual Directions:\nAll kneel in repentance.\n\nWe have heard: when the Grand Scribe ascended as an immortal, he transmitted the *Scriptures of the Nine Dark Prisons and Luminous Perfected*; when the Heavenly Master attained the Dao, he left the *Twenty-Fourfold Rites of Atonement*. These were not merely for recommending the long-departed, but especially to elucidate the Way of filial piety.\n\nI reflect on the departed [Name]: their floating life was like a dream, their great affliction was having a body. The six dusts thoroughly stained them, the three karmas entangled them, multiplying the filth of their sins. The five aggregates were not real; the four elements were a temporary convergence. Their actions touched the dusts of conditions, floundering on the paths of right and wrong, self and others, drifting amid the realms of emotions, desires, love, and aversion. Thoughts arose, words were spoken—day by day, month by month, their transgressions deepened.\n\nThe scales of judgment are impartial—none may escape their scrutiny; the realms of darkness and light follow different courses, and none can recall their own ascent or descent. In offering this filial devotion today, this disciple [Name], though young, has followed the winds of Dao and virtue, yet has not repaid the toil of parental kindness. If the departed spirit remains unliberated, how shall this heart find peace? Thus, in accordance with the mysterious statutes, I humbly present these offerings to cultivate hidden blessings: fragrant flowers, lamps and candles, and ritual alms. I bow in reverence to the Most High, Boundless Dao, the Ten Directions’ Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthies, the Ten Directions’ Heavenly Worthies Who Save from Suffering, and the divine officials of the ten realms.\n\nMay the grace of Heaven shine boundlessly, its vastness embracing all. May it consider that my departed kin were submerged in worldly entanglements and could not free themselves; that all their lives, they were ensnared by the nets of transgression—may these be wholly renewed. May they swiftly cast off the registers of the dark prisons and soon transform their forms in the cinnabar realms. Thus may both the living and the dead, in this and future lives, together encounter the time when Heaven opens and Earth unfolds; may both the Dao-seeking and the secular, the two gates, equally dwell beneath the illumination of sun and moon.\n\nAfter this confession and atonement, may they ascend into formlessness. The demon commanders are commanded to perform the *Step of Emptiness*.\n\nWe now thrice invoke, thrice bow, and once more proclaim the sacred ranks. We, your humble servants in these appointed roles, with utmost sincerity reverently address the Three Purities, the Four Brahmās, the Eight Poles, the Nine Empyreans, the Purple Palaces, the Yellow Chambers, the Cloud Palaces, the Stellar Courts, the supremely true and great, the boundless and infinite, the lofty immortals of the Three Realms, and the assembled sages of the Mystic Altar. May your vast compassion deign to cast its penetrating gaze upon us.\n\nWe reflect upon our own coarse and worthless natures, our narrow and shallow vision. Though we dwell within the Mystic Realm and study the books of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, though we transmit and practice the liturgical disciplines, how can we fully grasp the intentions of Lu and Zhang? Yet, moved by the vow to benefit and deliver all beings, we forget our unworthiness and persist in our practice.\n\nThe Three Bonds and Five Constants are the great foundation of human existence, while the Nine Dark Prisons and Ten Classes of beings are the lost souls who have strayed from the Dao. With this offering and invocation, we humbly seek their deliverance. Today, we perform this rite for the repentance of the deceased [Name] and for our ancestors, parents, and all suffering souls trapped in the eternal night of the Nine Dark Prisons.\n\nThough they once dwelt within human relationships, they sank beneath the principles of Heaven. The Five Teachings—affection for kin, righteousness, distinction, order, and trust—though constant, were not upheld. The Six Transgressions—unfiliality, disrespect for elders, discord, impropriety, irresponsibility, and lack of compassion—were committed to the point of utter neglect. Those above ruled without the Dao; those below served without loyalty. The customs of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame waned, while the habits of waywardness, perversity, excess, and extravagance prevailed.\n\nUnaware and deluded, in an instant the flower withered in the silver sea and the breath ceased at the jade tower. Yet, bound by lingering attachments, for ten thousand kalpas their feet tread upon the Mountain of Knives and their hands grasp the Trees of Swords. Today, your disciple [Name] seeks to unlock the secrets of the Purple Tenuity and specially performs the Rite of the Jade Casket. The courier tablets bridge the divide to the unseen, and the Dragon Lads deliver the missives of faith.\n\nWe look up to the great creation, beseeching your extraordinary grace. Where the radiance of the divine shines, no obscurity remains unilluminated; where your benevolent blessings extend, what grievance cannot be released?\n\nHaving drawn forth the earthly gates, they are no longer sunk in hell’s deep imprisonment; having paid morning homage to the celestial countenance, all together they arrive at the Dharma assembly of the Heavenly Venerable. Thus may we pray that heaven and earth commune in harmony, that sun and moon maintain their steadfast radiance. May the seas and lands enjoy enduring peace, all dwelling within the realm of longevity across the eight wilds; may the beings of heaven and earth receive deliverance, attaining ascent to the supreme perfection of the Most Real.\n\nAs for the divine tiger officials, the dragon tally couriers, and the messengers of the post stations—those who bear the current and proclaim transformation—all have labored to open the paths of the netherworld. In recognition of their virtue and in recompense for their merit, they are rightfully advanced to the ranks of immortal promotion.\n\nAbove, we beseech the transforming grace of the Heavenly Venerable’s great compassion; below, we offer the sincerity of our devotion in supplication. With reverence, we make this entreaty known.\n\nWe now utter our vows:\nFirst, may the primordial mandates of the Originator be fulfilled;\nSecond, may the darkest nights be illumined;\nThird, may the Golden Register deliver lives;\nFourth, may the Black Ledger erase transgressions;\nFifth, may the waves of the Sea of Suffering be stilled;\nSixth, may the smoke of the Fire Hell dissipate;\nSeventh, may joy and bliss fill the spirit;\nEighth, may all karmic entanglements be resolved;\nNinth, may the hearing of scriptures awaken the Dao;\nTenth, may advancement to the ranks of immortality be attained;\nEleventh, may the courts of Fengdu cease their judgments;\nTwelfth, may the study of the Dao culminate in transcendence.\n\nInvoking the spirits while burning incense:\nIncense Official Messengers, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all attending spirit officials—may this place of ritual devotion and morning cultivation naturally generate golden nectar, cinnabar-green mushroom essences, and the assembly of the hundred numinous perfected. May they gather here before this incense burner.\n\nMay the departed souls receive deliverance, and may your disciple be granted favor. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend and convey, through the orchid smoke, the sincerity of our entreaty, swiftly reaching the presence of the Most High and Boundless Dao, the Supreme Venerable of the Eastern Limit and Azure Mystery, the Compassionate Father of Great Unity, the Heavenly Venerable Who Saves from Suffering.\n\n*Exiting the altar*\n\nThe Master’s Grace\n\nThe nine-fold gates of Heaven’s portal swing open,\nas we perform the rites of morning audience to the Primordial;\nthe five torments of hell are unshackled,\nall share in the merit of deliverance.\n\nWith reverence we knock at the threshold of the Master’s precinct,\noffering our heartfelt thanks.\nYour disciple, having just now faithfully conducted the filial disciple So-and-so in the rites prescribed by the sacred canons,\nhas proclaimed and unfolded the ceremonial observances.\nYet I fear transgressions against the rule may have occurred,\nand dread the axe and iron that no lapse escapes.\nI humbly beseech your boundless compassion,\nand pray you deign to extend forbearance.\n\nMay the golden tally convey deliverance so that the nine nether realms bloom with spring;\nmay the cinnabar writ proclaim grace so that all prisoners stand released.\nMay the departed souls swiftly ascend the far shore of the Dao,\nforever attaining carefree transcendence;\nmay the Mystery Gate flourish in its ancestral majesty,\nand all beings partake of its transformative nurture.\nI, presumptuous before your august presence,\nam overwhelmed with gratitude.\n\nTurning Intentions Toward the Offering of the Jiao in Thanksgiving\n\n*Stepping in Void*\n*Purification by Sprinkling*\n*Proclamation of the Guarding Numinous Spell*\n*Invocation of the Dignities of the Ranks*\n\nWe, your humble servants, So-and-so and others,\nwith one heart address the assembled sages,\nhoping for your vast compassion,\nand trusting in your all-seeing illumination.\n\nWe have heard:\nthe Dao is the function of the collective heart,\nand no thing can oppose it;\nfilial piety is the first of the hundred practices,\nand all people should strive to embody it.\nNo deed of parents is greater,\nfor it matches the creation of Heaven and Earth.\nThus did the Divine Mother complete her teaching in the Yellow Hall,\nfirst clarifying the Way of filial piety;\nthus did the Dark Emperor transmit scripture from the Jade Basket,\nfully expounding the repayment of kindness.\nThis is not merely to fulfill the duties of nurturing life and mourning death,\nbut also to accumulate merit and cultivate conditions for entering the wondrous.\n\nSu the Immortal left the orange well to establish merit for his compassionate mother;\nZhenwu feasted in the valley crags to cultivate fruit for his two parents.\nFrom these examples we see the greatness of human bonds,\nwhich stand foremost for those who would learn the Dao.\n\nWe now recall the filial disciple So-and-so,\nwho has taken refuge in the Dharma,\nyet remains parted from his parents’ side.\nHe offers sweet food and fine clothing\nto nourish their bodies.\nYet he cannot fully express the filial devotion of the worldly,\nnor seek rare formulas and wondrous medicines\nto prolong their years;\nhow much less can he follow the teachings of the Scripture of Great Peace,\nlamenting their untimely departure from the world,\nand give his life to follow them?\nWalking through frost and dew, he is moved to sorrow;\ngazing at the pines and catalpas, he weeps in grief.\nThe years and months have passed—\nhe knows not where their souls now dwell;\nin dreams he sees them,\ntheir voices and faces vivid as if present.\n\nThus he cultivates the fruits of the Dao,\nhoping to bring some blessing to the dark paths of the dead.\nLighting lamps and burning incense,\nhe follows the canons of the Jade Casket and the Pacts with the Perfected;\nrefining souls and forging spirits,\nhe performs the rites of the Purple Pivot and the Flying Dharani.\nFortunately, the Dharma rites have been completed,\nand we trust the numinous light has responded.\n\nWe humbly pray that the august and majestic Great Dao,\nthe illustrious and lofty Perfected,\nwill look upon the deepest feelings of the hidden heart,\nand specially expand the virtue of cherishing life.\nMay the Nine Dragons transmit the imperial edict,\ndissolving the prisons of the underworld with wind and thunder;\nmay the Ten Thousand Wardens stay their punishments,\nand the rain and dew revive the guilty souls.\nMay the departed spirits attain deliverance,\nand ascend at every moment.\nMay the nine generations of ancestors be reborn in Heaven,\nso that the intent of leaving the household may not be in vain;\nmay the single heart that yearns for the Dao\nnever forget the work of self-cultivation.\n\nWe, your humble servants, are filled with longing and awe beyond measure.\n\n*Invocation of the Assembly*\n*Descend, O Sages*\n\n**Proclamation of the Petition**\n\nWe, your humble servants, have heard: though Heaven is high, its hearing reaches the lowly, for only sincerity can move it; a child may wish to honor their parents, yet they are no longer there—such has ever been the way of things. Thus, even the worthy Zeng Shen grieved with the sorrow of three cauldrons, and Fan Zhongyan bore the bitter regret of a single wisp of smoke. If even the virtuous hold fast to this, how could those beyond the world alone lack such a heart? Unable to fulfill their duty in life, they must carry lingering sorrow in death.\n\nFortunately, the Heavenly Worthy has bestowed the Jade Treasury’s rite for delivering the dead, allowing filial children to express their boundless devotion to the vastness of Heaven. Some build huts by graves, observing mourning beyond propriety for a lifetime; others carve wooden effigies, serving the departed as though they yet lived. Though their filial devotion is evident, it brings no benefit to the dead. How much better to present a green memorial, laying bare one’s grief before the Emperor on High; to dispatch a white talisman, snatching the dead from the underworld! When the spirits have somewhere to return, how could the living alone find no solace? Thus do we know that the teachings of the Dao extend where the rites of Confucius cannot reach.\n\nWe, your humble servant, the filial disciple [Name], lament our meager fate, having suffered misfortune in youth. The toil of nurture and care—how could we ever repay it? The withered weeds and desolate sorrow linger only in the heart. Therefore, we undertake this rite of refinement and deliverance, to bring some small blessing to the netherworld. Bearing the banner of the Perfected, we establish this pure offering in gratitude.\n\nWe humbly pray that the Imperial Judgment will weigh our hearts, and Heaven grant our desires. Mindful that our departed parents accumulated virtue yet did not live to see its reward, and pitying this humble servant’s longing to fulfill filial duty yet unable to convey it, may You specially bestow the grace of absolution, washing away the suffering of the deep darkness. May the departed soul soon escape the gates of the underworld. May their jade eyes refine their form, and yellow blossoms purify their frame, transforming their being in the Cinnabar Realm; may the green script restore life, and the Golden Chamber deliver their destiny, allowing them to ascend to the Upper Clarity. May they shed their mortal form and attain the True, turning the Wheel to achieve the Dao.\n\nWe, your humble servants, reverently offer incense and present the second libation.\n\n**Proclamation of the Memorial**\n\nWe, your humble servants, have heard: the origin of Qian and Kun is the source of human life; the forms of father and mother are the foundation of our own. Generation after generation, thought after thought, hardship and suffering arise therefrom. The care and nurture they bestowed—what gratitude could ever repay it? Those who attain the Dao recognize the true parents in the fundamental consciousness. To extinguish greed and anger, to remove peril and harshness—this is how we repay their kindness. To empty habitual attachments, to sever love and affection—thus do we naturally shed our burdens. When the conditioned returns to the unconditioned, it is called True Emptiness, yet it is not empty in truth. This is the gate of liberation, through which one may reach the realm of carefree wandering.\n\nWe, your humble servants, reflect upon the deceased [Name], entangled in the snares of the world, drowned in delusive conditions. The sea of desire and river of love easily unleash the nature of ignorance; the lightning’s flash and the spark from stone scarcely preserve the body of contemplation. Their life suddenly ended, their name entered the ledgers of the dead. With the nine knots and ten fetters yet uncleansed, how could they escape the three paths and five sufferings?\n\nWe recall that in years past, they sent their child forth to leave the household, entrusting their heart to the Dao. Today, we seek to deliver the departed from suffering, trusting in the compassion of the teachings. We humbly pray that You will extend the grace of universal salvation, vastly expanding the virtue of deliverance. Command Lord Tao to review the registers, and bid Marshal Han to guide the souls. May the deceased [Name] receive office in the Vermilion Palace and have their name inscribed in the Yellow Register. May the one hundred and eighty afflictions and karmic obstructions dissolve entirely, and the eighty-four thousand defilements and delusive conditions be utterly exhausted. May they forever depart the realms of suffering and instantly enter the lineage of immortals, henceforth moving freely through the Six Voids, no longer subject to the cycles of the Three Realms.\n\nMoreover, we pray that the disciple [Name] may extend this grace to past masters, ancestral teachers, and kin, both Daoist and lay, that all may ascend together. May descendants walk the path of good fortune, encountering no obstacles in their pursuit of immortality or advancement in the Dao. May the orthodox, the wondrous, and the subtly profound be cultivated and manifested; we vow never to betray the teachings of repaying kindness. May the self and others, all conditioned forms, return to non-attachment, and may we soon enter the gate of the True One.\n\nWe, your humble servants, reverently offer incense and present the final libation.\n\n**Proclamation of the Memorial**\n**Send-off of the Deities**\n\nI have heard: the Dao cannot be represented in form—scattered, it becomes qi; gathered, it takes shape. The divine is originally without direction—listening, one does not hear it; gazing, one does not see it. Only through the silent resonance of spirit does it seem to ascend and descend as if present.\n\nNow, as the courtly rites are concluded, we bow to send you forth. We humbly imagine the Three Clarities and Supreme Saints roaming the boundless realms, the Underworld officials of the Nine Earths resuming their duties in the dark yin domains. Swiftly and suddenly, they depart to where we know not; lingering, we regret we cannot follow.\n\nWe, your servants—mere walking corpses of flesh and bone, base as dust and mud—have presumptuously encountered the transformative power of the Dao and stand among the ranks of the true. Yet in our reverence and posture, we may have erred in decorum; in our steps and bearing, we may have faltered in rhythm. In our memorials, we may have failed the method of soaring spirit; in our talismanic writing, we may have violated the rules of brushwork.\n\nWe beseech you to overlook our transgressions and record our merits, that we may avoid incurring guilt through this offering. How could we repay such virtue? We shall redouble our efforts in devotion and cultivation. Though your majesty does not turn away in displeasure, we pray ever to receive your gracious audience.\n\nOur humble hearts are overwhelmed with longing and reluctance. Gazing toward the celestial thoroughfares, we bow with single-minded devotion to send you forth.\n\n**Hymn of the Returning Chariot**\n**Offering of Transformative Wealth to Send Forth**\n\n**Ritual of the Mystic Gate for Filial Recompense and Merit-Transference Concluded**",

One fascicle.\n*Source:* *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Dongxuan Section, Category of Ritual Propriety.\n\n---\n\n**Daoist Rite for Filial Piety and Deliverance of the Departed**\n\n**Natural Audience and Procession of the Dao**\nThe master’s hall is arranged in proper order.\n*Stepping in Void*\n*Invoking the Master*\n\nWith reverence, we acknowledge that the Golden Perfected expound the teachings, widely disseminating the scriptures of deliverance and salvation; the Jade Registers transmit the ordinances, abundantly setting forth the methods of ascent and transcendence. Both the living and the dead depend upon them, and the hidden and manifest realms alike receive their blessings. Thus, the Eastern Pole extends its compassion for the suffering, and the Northern Dipper establishes the bureau for the deliverance of the departed, enabling lost souls to receive salvation and withered bones to live again. Presumptuously, we approach the august and solemn, humbly beseeching your witness and validation.\n\nWe reverently consider the Masters of the Dao within the Mysterious Realm, whose teachings span the Three Powers, whose hearts embrace the myriad forms. Adapting their teachings to all directions, they respond to beings with fluid manifestations, serving as the bridge between life and death and governing the hidden and dark realms. We, your humble servant, a mere speck in the vastness of the floating kalpas, a fleeting life in the Lingbao tradition, have presumptuously ascended the ladder of the boundless Perfected and been granted the guidance of the Masters of the Mysterious Realm, to deliver the hidden and stagnant and to benefit beings and aid humanity.\n\nToday, we earnestly act on behalf of the petitioner, ever mindful of the departed souls, boundless in their suffering. From past lives to this present existence, they have accumulated myriad transgressions and countless faults—sins committed in the yang realm and offenses hidden in the yin. Their crimes violate the Azure Laws, and their names are recorded in the Black Books. Confined in the cold courts, imprisoned in the dark prisons—if they do not turn and submit to the Jade Steps, how can they be summoned to the Imperial Altar? We dare to knock our heads before the Celestial Might, humbly beseeching compassion for the hidden and stagnant.\n\nWe prostrate ourselves in sincere devotion, disturbing the Azure Mystery on high, and implore the descent of your grace and light to illuminate the darkness. May the true compassion draw them forth, and may the sagely virtue show mercy. Proclaim the talismanic commands at the River Source, transforming the sword trees into jade trees; issue the Red Writs in the prisons, turning the knife mountains into treasure mountains. May the radiant light of wisdom shine brightly, fulfilling the vows of great compassion, dispelling the endless night and illuminating the hidden paths. Thus, may the departed souls equally attain the fruits of the Dao, escape the retributions of the Nine Springs, and ascend to the immortal realms in carefree wandering.\n\nWe look up to receive the mysterious grace, that it may soon be manifestly repaid. Yet our humble devotion cannot fully express the sincerity of our prayers. Leading the assembly, we ascend the altar and reverently perform the ritual forms.\n\n*Chanting the Dao*\n*Ascending the Altar*",

      "translated_text": "As for the sun and moon, they lend it their brilliance; the kingly Dao, they bring it to fulfillment. Master Lan received its teachings from the Dipper Perfected, while Mother Shen transmitted its scriptures to the Grand Scribe. Thus, the rites of Pure Brightness root the heart in loyalty to the sovereign and filial piety to kin; the Fast of the Covenant with the Real founds its teaching on repaying ancestors and recommending kin. From this we see that those who study immortality—how could they not devote themselves wholeheartedly to their parents? To claim they sever Heaven’s constant bonds is but the self-serving argument of Confucians. If one examines the Daoist canons, how could one not recognize the great filial piety of the Heavenly Perfected?\n\nI, your humble servant, though of common talent, have presumptuously taken part in the study of the Mysteries. I uphold the scriptural ordinances to enlighten and transform, and wear the precepts and disciplines to cultivate through burning incense. Though I have left form and abandoned wisdom to merge with the Great Thoroughfare—even so, I take up the words of Yan Yuan. In revering the dead and pursuing the distant, I return to profundity, ever mindful of the expansive sayings of Zengzi. As a fellow disciple, my resolve is earnest in recommending my kin. As a libationer, duty compels me to present this petition. Ascending and descending at your side, I am fortunate to gaze upon the majestic radiance of the Imperial Perfected. Filial piety and fraternal duty reach the gods; luminous clarity discerns the human. For this humble request of mine, since I have received your gracious assent, how dare I not make it known above?\n\nProclamation of the Petition:\nFollowing the words of the petition, I have exhausted all sincerity and earnestness. Looking up, I beseech the Great Dao; looking down, I pray for your discernment of my humble heart.\n\nI have heard: the people are born of the Three, yet serve them as one. The Dao emerges from the One, yet its teachings divide into Three. Thus, to serve the sovereign as one serves the father is to fulfill the meaning of loyalty and filial piety; to govern the state as one governs the self is to perfect the transformation of purity and stillness. Among those who dwell in the Real, none esteem more highly than repaying the sovereign. Therefore, the Wondrous Precepts of the Nine Perfected take reverent diligence as the gateway to virtue; the Fundamental Ordinances of the Three Registers take burning incense and cultivation as the intent of praying for blessings. The origins of this teaching are ancient; those who study it should take it as their model.\n\nToday, as we ascend the altar to perform the Dao, the assembled ritualists and I now offer the first pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke rise to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Treasure of the Utmost Real and Perfect Dao. We prostrate ourselves, our heads touching the earth, and take refuge in the Three Honored Ones of the Most High and the sacred assemblies of the Ten Directions. With this merit, we pray above for the emperor’s sacred longevity and eternal peace.\n\nMay the Dao align with the Mysterious Sage, and virtue match August Heaven. May the Mandate favor the virtuous with prosperity, and the ancestral altars extend ten thousand years of felicity. Without action, may the people transform themselves; may Huaxia and the barbarians return to the unity of a single realm.\n\nNow, therefore, we burn incense, taking refuge in the virtue of the Dao-Honored, the Great Sacred Assemblies, and the Perfected of the Utmost Real. After attaining the Dao, may we harmoniously preserve Heaven’s enduring existence.\n\nI have heard: humans originate from their ancestors; filial piety begins with one’s parents. According to the ritual classics, beyond the seven ancestral temples and the two remote shrines, others are not included in the seasonal sacrifices. Yet by the Daoist scriptures, even a hundred thousand generations of ancestors should be included in the rites of recommendation and deliverance. For there are those among the long-departed who have not received deliverance and thus cannot attain immortality, just as there are those who, having failed to sacrifice to their ancestors in past lives, still bear the burden of sin. Thus, the *Nüqing Prohibitions* contain passages on redemption and deliverance, while the *Fundamental Chapters of the Numinous Treasure* place the rites of posthumous deliverance at their head. For Daoist cultivators, this is the foremost duty. Therefore, the Heavenly Worthy established the teaching with clear instructions.\n\nToday, as we ascend the altar to perform the Dao, the assembled ritualists and I now offer the second pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke rise to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Treasure of the Utmost Real and Perfect Scriptures. We prostrate ourselves, our heads touching the earth, and look up to the Three Honored Ones of the Most High and the sacred assemblies of the Ten Directions. With this merit, may it flow back to repay filial devotion.\n\nMay the disciple [Name], both clerical and lay, along with the primordial ancestors and past generations of their lineage, bathe in this good merit and together ascend to the immortal realms. May the edicts of the Three Realms descend with the crane-tallied decrees, and may the Nine Dark Prisons receive the grace of the dragon tablets. Rooted in remembrance of their ancestral origins, may they swiftly be delivered from the Yellow Springs’ registry; merging transformations to return to the Primal One, may their spirits immediately ascend to the Vermilion Fire Palace.\n\nNow, therefore, we burn incense, taking refuge in the virtue of the Scripture-Honored, the Great Sacred Assemblies, and the Perfected of the Utmost Real. After attaining the Dao, may we harmoniously ascend into the formless.\n\nI have heard: vast and subtle, the Way of the noble person can be transmitted; toilsome nurturing and rearing, the kindness of parents knows no greater weight. All who possess blood and qi at least know to employ their feelings; how could those who contemplate the Dao forget their roots? For there are those who in life failed to express their devotion, and in death still yearn to make offerings. Master Wang honored his parents by following the *Original Conduct of the Jade Emperor*; his aspirations were ultimately fulfilled. The son of the Mo family recited the *Hidden Scriptures of the Azure Empyrean* to deliver his mother; he ultimately succeeded. Gazing upon the radiance of these former worthies, later people should take them as a bright mirror.\n\nToday, as we ascend the altar to perform the Dao, the assembled ritualists and I now offer the third pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke rise to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Treasure of the Utmost Real and Perfect Masters. We prostrate ourselves, our heads touching the earth, and look up to the Three Honored Ones of the Most High and the sacred assemblies of the Ten Directions. With this merit, may it directly serve the disciple [Name] in delivering the departed spirit of [Name], enabling them to depart the dark paths and ascend to the immortal realms.\n\nMay they ride the merit of the Three Transformations and Five Refinements, escaping the suffering of the Nine Nights’ dense darkness. May they consume flying roots to generate jade nectar, swiftly wandering the halls of the Great Vast; may they chew numinous mushrooms and sip golden springs, immediately soaring to the halls of the Grotto Yang.\n\nNow, therefore, we burn incense, taking refuge in the virtue of the Master-Honored, the Great Sacred Assemblies, and the Perfected of the Utmost Real. After attaining the Dao, may we harmoniously ascend into the formless.\n\nRitual Directions:\nAll kneel in repentance.\n\nWe have heard: when the Grand Scribe ascended as an immortal, he transmitted the *Scriptures of the Nine Dark Prisons and Luminous Perfected*; when the Heavenly Master attained the Dao, he left the *Twenty-Fourfold Rites of Atonement*. These were not merely for recommending the long-departed, but especially to elucidate the Way of filial piety.\n\nI reflect on the departed [Name]: their floating life was like a dream, their great affliction was having a body. The six dusts thoroughly stained them, the three karmas entangled them, multiplying the filth of their sins. The five aggregates were not real; the four elements were a temporary convergence. Their actions touched the dusts of conditions, floundering on the paths of right and wrong, self and others, drifting amid the realms of emotions, desires, love, and aversion. Thoughts arose, words were spoken—day by day, month by month, their transgressions deepened.",

Thus may both the living and the dead, in this and future lives, together encounter the time when Heaven opens and Earth unfolds; may both the Dao-seeking and the secular, the two gates, equally dwell beneath the illumination of sun and moon.\n\nAfter this confession and atonement, may they ascend into formlessness.

Yet, moved by the vow to benefit and deliver all beings, we forget our unworthiness and persist in our practice.\n\nThe Three Bonds and Five Constants are the great foundation of human existence, while the Nine Dark Prisons and Ten Classes of beings are the lost souls who have strayed from the Dao. With this offering and invocation, we humbly seek their deliverance. Today, we perform this rite for the repentance of the deceased [Name] and for our ancestors, parents, and all suffering souls trapped in the eternal night of the Nine Dark Prisons.\n\nThough they once dwelt within human relationships, they sank beneath the principles of Heaven. The Five Teachings—affection for kin, righteousness, distinction, order, and trust—though constant, were not upheld. The Six Transgressions—unfiliality, disrespect for elders, discord, impropriety, irresponsibility, and lack of compassion—were committed to the point of utter neglect. Those above ruled without the Dao; those below served without loyalty. The customs of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame waned, while the habits of waywardness, perversity, excess, and extravagance prevailed.\n\nUnaware and deluded, in an instant the flower withered in the silver sea and the breath ceased at the jade tower. Yet, bound by lingering attachments, for ten thousand kalpas their feet tread upon the Mountain of Knives and their hands grasp the Trees of Swords. Today, your disciple [Name] seeks to unlock the secrets of the Purple Tenuity and specially performs the Rite of the Jade Casket. The courier tablets bridge the divide to the unseen, and the Dragon Lads deliver the missives of faith.\n\nWe look up to the great creation, beseeching your extraordinary grace. Where the radiance of the divine shines, no obscurity remains unilluminated; where your benevolent blessings extend, what grievance cannot be released?",

      "translated_text": "**Proclamation of the Petition**\n\nWe, your humble servants, have heard: though Heaven is high, its hearing reaches the lowly, for only sincerity can move it; a child may wish to honor their parents, yet they are no longer there—such has ever been the way of things. Thus, even the worthy Zeng Shen grieved with the sorrow of three cauldrons, and Fan Zhongyan bore the bitter regret of a single wisp of smoke. If even the virtuous hold fast to this, how could those beyond the world alone lack such a heart? Unable to fulfill their duty in life, they must carry lingering sorrow in death.\n\nFortunately, the Heavenly Worthy has bestowed the Jade Treasury’s rite for delivering the dead, allowing filial children to express their boundless devotion to the vastness of Heaven. Some build huts by graves, observing mourning beyond propriety for a lifetime; others carve wooden effigies, serving the departed as though they yet lived. Though their filial devotion is evident, it brings no benefit to the dead. How much better to present a green memorial, laying bare one’s grief before the Emperor on High; to dispatch a white talisman, snatching the dead from the underworld! When the spirits have somewhere to return, how could the living alone find no solace? Thus do we know that the teachings of the Dao extend where the rites of Confucius cannot reach.\n\nWe, your humble servant, the filial disciple [Name], lament our meager fate, having suffered misfortune in youth. The toil of nurture and care—how could we ever repay it? The withered weeds and desolate sorrow linger only in the heart. Therefore, we undertake this rite of refinement and deliverance, to bring some small blessing to the netherworld. Bearing the banner of the Perfected, we establish this pure offering in gratitude.\n\nWe humbly pray that the Imperial Judgment will weigh our hearts, and Heaven grant our desires. Mindful that our departed parents accumulated virtue yet did not live to see its reward, and pitying this humble servant’s longing to fulfill filial duty yet unable to convey it, may You specially bestow the grace of absolution, washing away the suffering of the deep darkness. May the departed soul soon escape the gates of the underworld. May their jade eyes refine their form, and yellow blossoms purify their frame, transforming their being in the Cinnabar Realm; may the green script restore life, and the Golden Chamber deliver their destiny, allowing them to ascend to the Upper Clarity. May they shed their mortal form and attain the True, turning the Wheel to achieve the Dao.\n\nWe, your humble servants, reverently offer incense and present the second libation.\n\n**Proclamation of the Memorial**\n\nWe, your humble servants, have heard: the origin of Qian and Kun is the source of human life; the forms of father and mother are the foundation of our own. Generation after generation, thought after thought, hardship and suffering arise therefrom. The care and nurture they bestowed—what gratitude could ever repay it? Those who attain the Dao recognize the true parents in the fundamental consciousness. To extinguish greed and anger, to remove peril and harshness—this is how we repay their kindness. To empty habitual attachments, to sever love and affection—thus do we naturally shed our burdens. When the conditioned returns to the unconditioned, it is called True Emptiness, yet it is not empty in truth. This is the gate of liberation, through which one may reach the realm of carefree wandering.\n\nWe, your humble servants, reflect upon the deceased [Name], entangled in the snares of the world, drowned in delusive conditions. The sea of desire and river of love easily unleash the nature of ignorance; the lightning’s flash and the spark from stone scarcely preserve the body of contemplation. Their life suddenly ended, their name entered the ledgers of the dead. With the nine knots and ten fetters yet uncleansed, how could they escape the three paths and five sufferings?\n\nWe recall that in years past, they sent their child forth to leave the household, entrusting their heart to the Dao. Today, we seek to deliver the departed from suffering, trusting in the compassion of the teachings. We humbly pray that You will extend the grace of universal salvation, vastly expanding the virtue of deliverance. Command Lord Tao to review the registers, and bid Marshal Han to guide the souls. May the deceased [Name] receive office in the Vermilion Palace and have their name inscribed in the Yellow Register. May the one hundred and eighty afflictions and karmic obstructions dissolve entirely, and the eighty-four thousand defilements and delusive conditions be utterly exhausted. May they forever depart the realms of suffering and instantly enter the lineage of immortals, henceforth moving freely through the Six Voids, no longer subject to the cycles of the Three Realms.\n\nMoreover, we pray that the disciple [Name] may extend this grace to past masters, ancestral teachers, and kin, both Daoist and lay, that all may ascend together. May descendants walk the path of good fortune, encountering no obstacles in their pursuit of immortality or advancement in the Dao. May the orthodox, the wondrous, and the subtly profound be cultivated and manifested; we vow never to betray the teachings of repaying kindness. May the self and others, all conditioned forms, return to non-attachment, and may we soon enter the gate of the True One.\n\nWe, your humble servants, reverently offer incense and present the final libation.\n\n**Proclamation of the Memorial**\n**Send-off of the Deities**",
