and Flowing Pearl Method** (*Jinsuo Liuzhu*)\n　　The *Three-Five Step Framework* (*Sanwu Bugang*) Introduction\n　　The *Step Framework* (*Bugang*) is a method to strengthen the body, invigorate the spirit, and fortify the **qi** (*pò*).\n\n　　First, one begins with the *Earthly Poles* (*Diji*), laboring the body and fortifying the spirit so that the **qi** (*shénqì*) naturally settles and is stored. Then, one harmonizes with Heaven and Earth, summoning the divine spirits.\n\n　　Annotation: This method serves two purposes: first, to heal oneself; second, to retain surplus **virtue/power** (*dé*) for healing others.\n\n　　Its application is swift against calamities of water and fire.\n\n　　The *Celestial Lord* (*Lǎojūn*) instructed the *Supreme Void High Spirit Flying Morning Central Daoist Sovereign* (*Tàixū Shànglíng Fēichén Zhōngyāng Dàojūn*), who shaped the *Earthly Poles* as the *Seven-Star Dipper* (*Qīxīng Dǒu*). Annotation: The form of the *Seven-Star Dipper* (*Dǒu*).\n\n　　Annotation: *Long Life* (*Chángshēng*) emerges from the *Five Sufferings* (*Wǔkǔ*), the starting point of one’s life span. Annotation: The *Five Sufferings* (*Wǔkǔ*) are the calculations of the *Five Phases* (*Wǔyùn*).\n\n　　For instance, if one’s life is governed by the *Metal Phase* (*Jīn*), their vitality lies in *Peri* (*Sì*), for *Peri* is *Long Life*. Their death occurs in *Zi* (*Child*), and their burial in *Chǒu* (*Buffalo*). *Zi* and *Chǒu* are the *Five Sufferings*, and one steps out from them into *Long Life*—thus, it is called *Exiting Death and Entering Life* (*Chūsǐ Rùshēng*).\n\n　　For those governed by the *Wood Phase* (*Mù*), vitality lies in *Hài* (*Boar*), for *Hài* is *Long Life*. Their death occurs in *Wǔ* (*Horse*), and their burial in *Wèi* (*Sheep*). *Wǔ* and *Wèi* are the *Five Sufferings*.\n\n　　For those governed by the *Water Phase* (*Shuǐ*), vitality lies in *Shēn* (*Monkey*), for *Shēn* is *Long Life*. Their death occurs in *Mǎo* (*Rabbit*), and their burial in *Chén* (*Dragon*). *Mǎo* and *Chén* are the *Five Sufferings*.\n\n　　For those governed by the *Fire Phase* (*Huǒ*), vitality lies in *Yín* (*Tiger*), for *Yín* is *Long Life*. Their death occurs in *Yǒu* (*Rooster*), and their burial in *Xū* (*Dog*). *Yǒu* and *Xū* are the *Five Sufferings*.\n\n　　For those governed by the *Earth Phase* (*Tǔ*), the calculations are the same as those for the *Water Phase*. One takes the *Five Sufferings* as the starting points for vitality, death, and burial, and the *Eight Hardships* and *Nine Calamities* as the *Nine Difficulties* (*Jiǔ È*).\n\n　　The ancient true immortals all taught this method. It is called *Transcending the Five Sufferings and Eight Hardships*, *Dispelling the Nine Calamities*, and *Healing a Hundred Illnesses*—the master leads the disciple to ascend the framework.\n\n　　The later *Celestial Lord* (*Shàngjūn*) introduced the *Great Youth Lord* (*Dàtóngjūn*) and the *Lesser Youth Lord* (*Xiǎotóngjūn*), allowing one to exit the *Five Sufferings* and enter *Long Life*.\n\n　　Next, one proceeds from *Long Life* into the *King* and *Minister* phases. Annotation: For the *Metal Phase* (*Jīn*), vitality lies in *Peri* (*Sì*), and the *King* phase is in *Yǒu* (*Rooster*). For the *Wood Phase* (*Mù*), vitality lies in *Hài* (*Boar*), and the *King* phase is in *Mǎo* (*Rabbit*). For the *Water Phase* (*Shuǐ*), vitality lies in *Shēn* (*Monkey*), and the *King* phase is in *Zi* (*Child*). For the *Fire Phase* (*Huǒ*), vitality lies in *Yín* (*Tiger*), and the *King* phase is in *Wǔ* (*Horse*). For the *Earth Phase* (*Tǔ*), the calculations are the same as those for the *Water Phase*. The *Five Lineages* (*Wǔxìng*) cannot harm one another, thereby dispelling the calamities of the *Five Phases* (*Wǔxíng*).\n\n　　The *Celestial Lord* (*Zhàng*) further instructed: Annotation: *Zhàng* refers to the *Grand Supreme* (*Zǒngzhēn*), and *Zhang* refers to the *Celestial Master* (*Tiānshī*).\n\n　　*\"The human body begins its life from the Five Phases and also perishes through them. I have known this for a long time. Even if one does not understand it early, they will still be harmed by these calamities. All must first practice the *Yú Bù* (Tortoise Steps), tread upon the *Earthly Poles*, and follow the reverse and inverted order of the three ranks. Then, recite the Five-Phase incantations to dispel them, and within one year, the calamities will be dispelled. Annotation: The Five-Phase incantations are found in the first volume of the *Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl* (*Jinsuo Liuzhu*), containing five verses.*\n\n　　First, one performs the *Bundle Facing* (*Shùxiàng*) ritual, drums the *Heavenly Drum* (*Tiāngǔ*) thirty-six times, and invigorates the body as prescribed. Then, one ignites the furnace, raises the *Official* (*Guān*), and sits in reflection upon the *Supreme One’s Hall* (*Tàiyī Fǔ*). Upon completion, one stands and reflects upon the *Officials of the Six Star Lords* (*Liuxingjun*) and their *Soldiers* (*Bīng*), as depicted in the diagram to the left and right. One then dons the *Seven-Star Dipper* (*Qīxīng Dǒu*) robes in a full circle, weeping while donning the robes, and raises the *Official* (*Guān*). After completing the ritual, one ascends the *Step Framework*.\n\n　　Upon finishing the *Step Framework*, one recites the five incantations to break the mutual opposition of the Five Phases. Then, one ascends the *Step Framework* five times again, circling it. After completion, one recites the twelve incantations to subdue the twelve *Branches* (*Zhīgān*) and *Heavenly Stems* (*Tiāngān*), securing *Long Life* and dispelling the Five-Phase calamities. Within one year, one avoids evil; within two years, one avoids harm from weapons; within three years, one avoids harm from spirits. By the fourth year, one becomes an *Earthly Immortal* (*Dìxiān*), and all harm and calamity dare not approach.\n\n　　From this point onward, blessings and joy are boundless. One commands the divine spirits, tames the flying dragon, the *Supreme Ultimate* (*Tàijí*) bestows the *Numinous Herb* (*Shízhī*), and the *Jade Emperor* (*Yùdì*) grants the *Youthful Immortal* (*Tóng*). If practiced for twenty-seven years, one becomes a *High Clarity True Person* (*Shàngqīng Zhēnrén*). Annotation: This explanation states that the *Golden Lock* (*Jinsuo*) method must be practiced first, followed by the *Heavenly Framework* (*Tiāngāng*) and *Flying Steps* (*Fēibù*) method, to achieve the effects as described earlier by the *Celestial Lord* (*Shàngjūn*). If one only practices the *Heavenly Framework*, it may not necessarily dispel evil.\n\n　　This method requires first practicing the *Earthly Poles*, then ascending the *Heavenly Framework*—only then will one have the effects of dispelling evil. If one practices the *Heavenly Framework* without first establishing the *Earthly Poles*, there will be no response from the divine spirits.\n\n　　In the past, the ancient *Broad Achievement Lord* (*Guǎngchéngjūn*) taught the *Yellow Emperor* (*Huángdì*) the *Flying Steps of Heavenly Steel* (*Tiāngāng Fēibù*). The *Yellow Emperor* practiced it for thirty years without divine response. Later, he sought the method again, and the *Celestial Lord* then gave him the first volume of the *Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl* (*Jinsuo Liuzhu*) and explained the *Earthly Poles* method. Within one year, he could summon and subdue spirits to his will. In the second year, he annihilated *Chīyóu* (a mythical tyrant). In the third year, his strength was sufficient to wrestle tigers and leopards. By the twenty-seventh year, he could transform his form and manifest countless wonders. At the twenty-eighth year, he ascended to Heaven.\n\n　　Though the human body is born of Heaven and nurtured by Earth, its foundation is rooted in Earth. If one seeks the *Heavenly Framework* without first establishing the *Earthly Poles* as the root and foundation, it is like building a pavilion without a base—how can it stand firmly in the air? The *Ancient Lords* (*Qiánshèng Hòushèng*) all descended personally to instruct their disciples in practice.\n\n　　Annotation: The master leads the disciple to ascend the framework, transcending the *Five Sufferings* and *Eight Hardships*.\"\n\nUpon completion, the master unites with the disciple, donning the **Seven Stars** like a garment, which is called the **Conjoined Garment**. The master and disciple wear the **Conjoined Garment** on their left and right sides.\n\n　　Annotation: The male first begins from the left, the female from the right.\n\nThe first **Star of Vitality** (*Chīyóu*’s constellation).\n　　Annotation: The left hand is **□**, the left elbow (above the head) is **□**, the left shoulder is **□**, the heart is **□**, the right shoulder is **□**, the right elbow is **□**, and the right hand is **□**. When the first **Star of Vitality** is formed, the **Child of the Central Lord** (*Zǐshēng Rénzhǔ*) is born. The practitioner stands upright, raises their hands, and covers their head. Annotation: This wards off malevolent humans and evil spirits; the right hand points at them, and the practitioner twists the **incantation formula** (*niǎnjué*) as needed, with the formula found in the **Palm Incantations** (*Zhǎngjué*).\n\nInitially, when the **Conjoined Garment** is worn, the **incantation formula** is not yet applied. Annotation: *Idle* means not yet applied; in urgent moments, it can be instantly bound to water and fire.\n\nThe second **Star of Yin Precision** (*Yīnjīng* constellation).\n　　Annotation: The right hand is **□**, the right elbow is **□**, the right shoulder is **□**, the heart is **□**, the left shoulder is **□**, the left elbow is **□**, and the left hand is **□**. When the second **Star of Yin Precision** is formed, the **Child of the Central Lord** born under the hours of *Chǒu* and *Hài* (*Hòushèng*) is summoned. The practitioner stands upright, raises their right hand, and covers their head. Annotation: This wards off serpents, tigers and leopards, spirits and beasts, venom, silence, and malevolent ghosts and deities. The **□** is used, and the practitioner grasps the **□ Star**, pointing at each one sequentially. If facing an enemy, the practitioner turns their hand around their body as needed. The **Stars of Vitality** are worn on the left and right sides of the **Star of Yin Precision**, which is then applied.\n\nIf used urgently, it will instantly take effect. If not yet applied, it is still superior; superior, it reaches the **Seven Stars**, and further verification is made.\n\nThe third **Star of the True Immortal** (*Zhēnrén Dàxīng*).\n　　Annotation: The left hand is **□**, the left elbow is **□**, the left shoulder is **□**, the heart is **□**, the right elbow is **□**, the right knee is **□**, and the right foot is **□**. When the third **Star of the True Immortal** is formed, the **Child of the Central Lord** born under the hours of *Yín* and *Xū* (*Rénzhǔ*) is summoned. Annotation: The **Child of the Central Lord** may be summoned for matters related to the hour of *Yín*, or for seeking longevity when born under *Yín* and *Xū*, or to counter those who plot against them. It can also repel malevolent humans and ghosts, tigers and wolves, ferocious beasts, mountain spirits, poisonous deities, and demonic figures—all coming from the eastern *Yín* or western *Xū* directions. When they arrive, the practitioner twists the **Grand Marshal Formula** (*Dūjiàn Jué*), causing the **Third True Immortal Star** (**□**) to strike them down, and they will all submit and die.\n\nIf an enemy comes, the practitioner forms the left hand as **Arcuate Cover** (*Kuìgài*), covers their head, and points with the right hand as **□**, causing the enemy to submit. If they do not submit, the **Northern Dipper** (*Běidǒu*) will drink their blood, and they will die within ten days from heartache. Practitioners of the **Dao** must be cautious not to invoke this.\n\nThe application of the first two stars is also the same as this third star.\n\nBend your right hand forward, covering your head with your left hand, then apply the three or five fingers [as prescribed].\n\n**Note:** *\"Fingers\"* here refers to the act of exorcising with a shout.\n\nFor seeking longevity, calculating fortune and rank, or ensuring military advantage, face the sun and perform this at noon when hidden—it will cause them to self-destruct.\n\nTrue persons do not suffer from stalking. If one wears the **Configurative Robe** (*Pèiyī*) on their body, its efficacy is profound. However, it should only be used by those cultivating longevity while sleeping at night, keeping the breath (*hū*) stored on the left shoulder.\n\n**Note:** For women, it is on the right shoulder.\n\nThis ensures the practitioner’s spirit remains tranquil, fearing no malevolent spirits or ghosts. Within a year, such disturbances will cease.\n\n**Note:** If a husband performs this monthly, three times a day, after a year, its power will manifest like a deity’s emergence and disappearance.\n\n**Fourth Star of Mysterious Obscurity** (*Xuánmíng Xīng*)\n**Note:** Form the right hand as **□**, the right elbow as **□**, the right shoulder as **□**, the heart as **□**, the left chest as **□**, the left knee as **□**, the left foot as **□**, and **□** to complete the gesture.\n\nWhen all four limbs are aligned, those born in the *Mao-Yǒu* directions govern it.\n\n**Note:** Its applications are twofold:\n1. For self-cultivation—seeking blessings of longevity, fortune, and rank, or healing bodily misfortunes, diseases, and calamities.\n2. For others—when practicing prohibitive *qi*-binding methods, all seven stars must be used in conjunction with the *Bǎi Jìn* (Hundred Prohibitions).\n\nBend your left foot forward, covering your head with your right hand, then apply the three or five methods [as prescribed].\n\n**Note:** This method is particularly effective against military conflicts and official misfortunes. Other uses align with the seven stars.\n\n**Fifth Star of the Elixir Origin** (*Dānyuán Xīng*)\n**Note:** Form the left foot as **□**, the left knee as **□**, the left elbow as **□**, the heart as **□**, the right shoulder as **□**, the right elbow as **□**, and the right hand as **□**, then **□** to exorcise demons and malevolent spirits.\n\nWhen all five limbs are aligned, those born in the *Chén-Shēn* directions govern it.\n\n**Note:** Its applications are the same as the fourth star.\n\nBend your left foot forward, covering your head with your right hand, and apply it as before.\n\n**Sixth Star of the Northern Pole** (*Běijí Xīng*)\n**Note:** Form the right foot as **□**, the right knee as **□**, the right elbow as **□**, the heart as **□**, the left shoulder as **□**, the left elbow as **□**, and the left hand as **□**, then **□** for prohibitive control.\n\nWhen all six limbs are aligned, those born in the *Wèi-Wèi* directions govern it.\n\n**Note:** Its applications are the same as before.\n\nBend your right foot forward, covering your head with your left hand, and apply it as before.\n\n**Seventh Star of the Heavenly Pass** (*Tiānguān Xīng*)\n**Note:** Form the left hand as **□**, the left elbow as **□**, the left shoulder as **□**, the heart as **□**, the right shoulder as **□**, the right elbow as **□**, and the right hand as **□**, then **□** to apply it.\n\nWhen all seven limbs are aligned, those born in the *Wǔ* direction govern it.\n\n**Note:** This star uniquely subdues all malevolent humans, demons, and spirits—ten thousand spirits and myriad evils that cause disturbances. It is the sole star capable of swiftly controlling them, surpassing even water and fire in speed.\n\nThough the stars are used sequentially, the *Step-Star* method retains its prohibitive power. Only the **Heavenly Pass Star** can dominantly subdue ghosts, malevolent figures, military conflicts, official misfortunes, and countless diseases. Its execution is as swift as water and fire.\n\nThe seven stars have various ritual offerings (*jiào*). Know this: offerings must follow the prescribed rites and timing.\n\nIn the spring months of the first and second lunar months, or in autumn during the seventh and eighth lunar months, perform sacrifices according to one’s natal star on clear days.\n\nDo not perform sacrifices at other times, lest misfortune be invited—do not presume to seek blessings recklessly.\n\nAdditionally, for those practicing the *Step-Halo* (*Bùgāng*), sacrifices must be conducted twice yearly in spring and autumn.\n\n**Note:** If one practices the *Step-Halo* or *Memory-Tracing* methods, monthly cultivation is required, with sacrifices performed twice a year. Offerings should include money, wine, fresh rice cakes, fruits, and other ritual foods as specified in the *Líu Zhū Jīng* (Lower Grade).\n\nThis is the later sage-emperor’s revelation to the Celestial Master: the **Northern Dipper** is the **Central Dipper**. The Central Dipper’s nine stars transform into the nine spirits, forming the **Star-Halo** (*Xīnggāng*) through their steps.\n\nYu saw a spirit bird stepping on the Star-Halo, turning stones and wood, and consuming serpents. After three years of learning, his art perfected, he could invert the nine stars, aligning them with his feet—touching objects with his toes made them move, unaware his hands were the true agents.\n\nLater, ascending the peaks of the Shèkè Mountains, a divine person instructed him: *\"Why do you step with your feet when your hands can do it?\"* Yu was then taught to use his toes instead. The king saw the spirit bird stepping with its beak-like toes and bowed in acceptance.\n\nAfterward, he attained the Dao, commanding ghosts, dragons, tigers, and leopards. He dredged rivers, regulated floods, and delineated the Nine Regions.\n\nUpon ascending to imperial rule, he mastered the Dao, interpreted the *Yì*, transformed his form, and ascended to the **Supreme Pole** (*Tàijí*).\n\n**Note:** Though he did not attain the **Upper Clarity True Person**, he governed the lower realm’s water and drought from the **Left Great One’s Domain** (*Zuǒ Tài Yī Fǔ*).\n\nYu received divine instruction:\n\n**Note:** This is the **Mandate of the Celestial Official** passed to Yu.\n\nThe words were: *\"Observe the Northern Dipper—this is the Central Dipper’s **Heavenly Pass Star**.\"*\n\n**Note:** Daoist scriptures state that the **Central Dipper’s Great Arc** oversees all spirits, thus this is the Central Dipper.\n\nThe *Dà Jīn Suǒ Liú Zhū Pǐn* states: *\"Now observe the Northern Dipper—this is the Central Dipper.\"*\n\nFor those facing sudden official persecution, military threats, or illnesses, this method is as swift as water and fire. Its power lies in the heart and hands, resonating with the palm, while the body and spirit also hold governing formulas—these are found in the **Palm Diagram**.\n\nThe **Most High Laozi** declared: *\"The Central Dipper governs the four limbs and the twenty-eight lunar mansions. In one day and night, it completes a celestial circuit. The Northern Dipper is revered, paying homage to the two Great True Stars.\"*\n\nIts third star is named the **True Person Star**, overseeing those in this world who seek true immortality. Thus, those cultivating the Dao must align their steps accordingly, daring not to offend the True Person Star, lest their fate and lifespan be diminished.\n\n「Moreover, there are **Nine Stars**, which must also be invoked in accordance with the **Stepwise Daoist Circuit** (*bùgāng*) while in cultivation. One must practice the **formulas of the True Person Star** and the **Emperor-Worthy Stars** (*Dìzūn*).\n\n*Note: The formulas are found in the *Gold Lock Flowing Pearl Palm Diagram Formulas* (*Jīnsuǒ Liúzhū Zhǎngzhōng Jué*).*\n\nAdditionally, within the mind, one must constantly visualize the **Three True** (*Sān Zhēn*). In the course of a month, one must practice the **Stepwise Daoist Circuit** five times.\n\n*Note: The Circuit also comprises **Seven Stars**—specifically, excluding the **Assisting Minister Stars** (*Fǔbì*).*\n\nIf the position of the **True Person Star** is unfavorable, one must avoid stepping upon it; instead, one must tread the **Stepwise Daoist Circuit** accordingly. This is known in the world as the **\"Treading the Earth Circuit\"** (*Nièdì Jì*).\n\nThis method requires one to follow the **Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper** (*Běidǒu Qīxīng*), excluding calamities and misfortunes, ascending to transcendence and emerging from mortality. It subjugates malevolent spirits, deities, and demons—such as **Dragon, Tiger, Leopard, and Manticore** (*lónghǔ páo jīng*), **noxious spirits and poisonous serpents** (*yāosuì dúshé*), and the **Great Demons of Heaven and Earth** (*Tiāndì Dàmó*). All must be invoked using the **Northern Dipper**, aligning with the **Five Dipper Lords** (*Wǔ Dǒu Jūn*) by sealing their names.\n\n*Note: The Five Dipper Lords are the seven stars of the Northern Dipper, excluding the **Assisting Minister Stars** (*Fǔbì*).*\n\nThe **Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper** are properly named **Dipper, Ox, Girl, Void, Peril, Hall, and Wall** (*Dǒu, Niú, Nǚ, Xū, Wēi, Shì, Bì*). However, in practice, they are called the **Five Dipper Lords** (*Wǔ Dǒu Jūn*)—that is, the **Luminous Yang** (*Yángmíng*) and **Yin Essence** (*Yīnjīng*), though this is incorrect.\n\n*Note: Because people do not know the true names of the Northern Dipper, they mistakenly call them Luminous Yang and Yin Essence.*\n\nThis is the **Central Dipper** (*Zhōng Dǒu*), which augments one’s lifespan and fulfills merit in the mortal realm, harmonizing with **Daoist Immortals** (*xiān pǐn*) and aligning with the **Northern Dipper**. One must first cultivate the **Northern Dipper**, then proceed to the **Central Dipper**.\n\nIf there are merits or misfortunes, one seeks salvation for others with the same swiftness as water and fire—this is verified.\n\nThe **Later Sage Emperor** (*Hòushèng Jūn*) instructed **Grandmaster of the True** (*Zǒng Zhēn*):\n\n*\"You must convey the **Supreme Daoist Teachings** (*Zhìrén Shàngjiào*) to those who are **Daoist Aspirants** (*zhìrén*).*\n*Note: It is not given to ordinary people.*\n\n*Daoist Aspirants* must cultivate with their hearts and minds, transmitting and practicing the teachings as instructed. Those who do so are then taught this method, entrusted to attain the **True Person** (*Zhēn Rén*) stage of cultivation. Do not let *Daoist Aspirants* lose their merit or diminish their lifespan, for then you would fail in your duty as the **Grandmaster of the True** (*Zǒng Zhēn Rén*).\n\nI command you to pass this on to all, and you must teach it to all *Daoist Aspirants*. Cultivation cannot surpass this.\n\n*Note: After transmitting the *Gold Lock Flowing Pearl Canon* (*Jīnsuǒ Liúzhū Zhèngjīng*), one concludes with a **ritual exorcism** (*jiào*). Then, this method is practiced.*\n\nEvery night, after completing the ritual exorcism, one must\n*Note: The invocation of fate is without urgency, aligning the names of the Seven Stars with the Five Dipper Lords.*\n\nseal the name of the Dipper Lord when the **Northern Dipper** (*Běidǒu*) is upright. The **Five Dipper Lords** (*Wǔ Dǒu Jūn*)—such as **□, □, □, □, □, □, □**—rotate in celestial vigilance, protecting mortals and allowing them to attain their own **True Essence** (*Zhēn*).\n\nCultivation must always be like the **\"Embodied Stars Diagram\"** (*Hán Yǐng Tú*). Those who seal the positions are entrusted to command the *Daoist Aspirants*.\n\n*Note: Daoist Aspirants do not use the Seven Stars to cover their bodies like clothing; rather, they visualize them within the mind without causing harm to the vital essence or diminishing one’s lifespan. By day, they remain in a tranquil state, practicing the Seven Stars Diagram to ensure their souls and spirits ascend with their bodies. Their bodily essence remains steadfast and undispersed, with the Seven Stars radiating brilliance. Ghosts and spirits fear this, and the cultivation resembles the \"Embodied Stars\" and the \"Embodied Grand Dao\" (Hán Hóng). Their Dao is inherently true, revered and guarded by Heaven and Earth, with spirits and demons submitting to their command. The Heavenly Demons welcome them, and the Three Officials (of Heaven, Earth, and Man) report their merit. When their merit is complete, they ascend to transcendence by day, becoming True Persons (Zhēn Rén). In all actions—standing, sitting, resting, or sleeping—they must not depart from their bodies.*\n\n*Note: Daoist Aspirants who constantly visualize the Seven Stars, day and night, without pause, will have their bodily essence shine like stars after a year. Their forms will embody the True Essence.*\n\n*Note: After a year of uninterrupted practice—standing, sitting, resting, or sleeping—while constantly visualizing the sealed Seven Stars, the stars’ essence enters deeply into the body, circulating in a perpetual Daoist Circuit, akin to the rotation of Heaven. Thus, it is named the \"Embodied Stars Daoist Essence Circuit\" (Hánxīng Zhēn Qīwéi Xīng Zhēn), also known as the \"Ascension to the Upper Clarity\" (Rù Shàngqīng), enabling one to repel armies.*\n\nAfter two years, they attain the **\"Embodied True Essence\"** (*Hán Zhēn*).\n\n*Note: For a year, in all actions—standing, sitting, resting, or sleeping—one must constantly strike the teeth and practice the formulas, which are found in the Palm Diagram. These are named the **Three Supreme Formulas** (Dōujīān, Dōushī, Dàdào). By constantly visualizing the Seven Stars, the Three Officials (of Heaven, Earth, and Man) fear the Seven Stars and dare not linger. They also do not allow the **Three Inches of Vital Essence** (*Sān Cùn*) to determine the Daoist Aspirants’ merits or demerits, virtues or faults. Instead, they report these directly to the Heavenly Emperor. Thus, the Nine Assemblies (of the underworld) have no records, and one’s fate is determined by their merits and demerits, either ascending to Daoist Immortality or being removed from the register of death. There is no killing or injury, no resentment or opposition. Their bodies tread the Daoist Circuit of Heaven and the Earthly Memorial, free from disease and death, firm and unyielding. Their spirits are controlled, their souls are stabilized, and their True Essence is not lost, so it is called the \"Stabilized True Essence\" (Dìng Zhēn).*\n\nAfter three years, they attain the **\"Earthly True Essence\"** (*Dì Zhēn*).\n\n*Note: Daoist Aspirants cultivate the Earthly Memorial (Dì Jì) while also practicing the Heavenly Circuit (Tiān Gāng), never ceasing in their standing, sitting, resting, or sleeping. They combine this with the service of the **Sacred Talismans** (*Líng Fú*), **Six Celestial Stems** (*Liù Jiǎ*), and **Three Sovereigns** (*Sān Huáng*). Such practitioners attain the True Essence within humanity, hence the name \"Earthly True Essence\" (Dì Xiān Zhēn).*\n\n*Note: As the scriptures describe the Earthly Immortals (Dì Xiān), they only practice the Heavenly Circuit (Tiān Gāng) or solely tread the Earthly Memorial (Dì Jì) to attain the rank of Earthly Immortals. Ghosts, spirits, and malevolent demons cannot harm their bodies. Even their families, plagued by evil spirits and demons, are protected. How much more so can they safeguard others with their talismanic power! In lands of calamity and evil, they become beacons of fortune and virtue. In homes of disaster and misfortune, they transform them into abodes of joy and prosperity. Once their divine power is attained, they must not act recklessly. They should emulate the loyalty and virtue of the **Supreme Sage** (Tàishàng), the **Later Sage Emperor** (Hòushèng Jūn), and the **Second Later Sage Emperor** (Èr Hòushèng Jūn).*」\n\n「Above all, do not lightly divulge this—be cautious.\n\nAfter five years, one gradually attains divine communion.\n\nAt **one-seven years**—\n*Note: In the first seven years, one follows the seven stars of the Northern Dipper (Beidou); in the next seven years, one follows the seven stars of the Central Dipper (Zhongdou).*\n\nThese two sets of seven stars were, by decree of the **Supreme Dao/Way Emperor of the Later Sage of Taiping Golden Gate (Taiping Jinque Housheng Xuanyuan Yuhuang Shangdaojun)**, sealed and appointed to guard and assist the human body, bearing titles such as [vacant]★, [vacant]★, [vacant]★, [vacant]★, [vacant]★, [vacant]★, [vacant]★—each a rank of Immortal. Those who earnestly receive this will immediately attain the True Immortal.\n\nIf a person of superior wisdom discerns these two sets of stars as identical in practice, then in **fourteen years**, they may attain the rank of *Tianzhen* (Heavenly True) and ascend in broad daylight. If an entire household practices together, even the house and its fowl will ascend with them—how much more so the people within.\n\n**Five Dippers should stand guard**—\n*Note: The five Dippers refer to one Dipper each in the east, west, south, and north, plus one central Dipper.*\n\nEach of the seven stars, along with the central ten, makes **fifteen Dippers**. Each Dipper has a sovereign, and each of the seven stars has its own name, as recorded in *The Golden Lock* (Jinsuo), Volume Two.\n\nThe Later Sage Emperor decreed and sealed the Earthly Memorial (Dì Jì) and Heavenly Gate (Tianque), naming these seven stars [vacant]★, [vacant]★, etc., all as appointed by the Dipper Sovereigns, according to their designated ranks and duties.\n\nFor instance, in spring, the Eastern Dipper Sovereign assigns the stars *Jiāo* (角), *Kàng* (亢), *Shì* (氏), *Fáng* (房), *Xīn* (心), *Wěi* (尾), and *Jī* (箕) to stand guard in the Central Dipper, bearing titles [vacant]★, [vacant]★, etc., for the purpose of prohibiting and directing.\n\nIn summer, it is the Southern Dipper; in autumn, the Western Dipper; in winter, the Northern Dipper. The four seasonal Dipper Sovereigns oversee the Central Dipper’s appointed stars.\n\nThe seven Dippers correspond to the *clothing of the Dipper* (Dòuyī), used to complete the ritual.\n\nSeated in tranquility, with the *Kui* (魁) star facing the Heavenly Circuit (Tiān Gāng), drumming **fifteen beats**.\n\n*Note: The initial seven Dippers’ clothing also contains methods for official ascension, detailed in the previous section. One must first complete the official ascension rites before donning the seven Dippers’ clothing, and the subsequent process follows similarly.*\n\nOnly then may one proceed with the incantations and dispel the Five Phases’ great calamities.\n\nRespectfully submitted by the humble servant—\n*Note: Then Xuán.*」\n\n「Notes: This pertains only to disciples’ wives, children, and successive descendants—others are ineligible.\n\nWithin the body, the **Sanwu Officials** (三五功曹) are established.\n\nAs recorded in *The Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl* (《金锁流珠》), Upper Volume, these were originally present but were later expanded in full by the Sage Emperor, hence the red script.\n\nUpon completing the **official ascension (出官)**, one stands immediately. First, hold the **Jingxing Star** (景星) in hand, then raise the left foot and recite:\n\n*\"Sanwu raises the foot—action complete!\"*\n\n*\"Ten Thousand Spirits assent, Sanwu is established, Ten Thousand Spirits unite, Sanwu proceeds, concealing form and shadow, ascending to the Azure Clouds.\"*\n\nProceed with the ritual: grip firmly, close the **qi**, and perform the **Tianzhu** (天柱) posture once.\n\nIf dispelling calamities and misfortunes, urgently use the left-hand sword grip, perform the **Yubu Steps** (禹步), and recite the **Sanwu Incantations** three times.\n*Note: Three recitations of five verses each—swift against water and fire, and the calamity shall dissolve.*\n\n**First Incantation:**\n*\"I receive the qi of Heaven and Earth, destined to be their envoy.\"*\n*(As recorded in *The Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl*, Upper Volume, originally taught by the Old Lord.)*\n\n**Second Incantation:**\n*Note: Further instructed by the Sage Emperor to the Heavenly Master.*\n*\"I was born of father and mother.\"*\n*(As recorded in *The Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl*, Upper Volume.)*\n\n**Third Incantation:**\n*Note: The Dao Lord taught the Old Lord, who passed it to Emperor Yu of Xia, who reversed it to form the *Qiankun Incantation* (乾坤祝).*\n*\"I was born of father and mother.\"*\n*(As recorded in *The Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl*, Upper Volume.)*\n\n**Fourth Incantation:**»\n\n**Note:** Emperor Yu reversed the third incantation of the Dao Lord, thereby obtaining the four characters *Qian Zun Yao Ling* (乾尊耀灵). Heaven bestowed the *Chengcheng* (成成) blessing to dispel calamity and grant longevity—this method was bestowed upon Yu, who recited and practiced it to attain the Dao.\n\n**Qian Zun Yao Ling.**\n*Note:* These four characters were spoken by Yu.\n\n**Reported Note:** The character *Kun* (坤) was derived from the mouth of Heaven.\n\n**Harmonizing the inner cultivation,** the two principles unite in harmony, the six directions bring auspiciousness.\n**Aligned with Heaven, enjoying Earth,** eternal peace and purity prevail.\n**Responding to the Mysterious Yellow,** the upper garment and lower robe are complete.\n**Zhen ascends, Gen thrives,** the unformed achieves clarity, Xun’s ruler brings vitality, the tiger strides and the dragon soars.\n**Heaven’s Gate and Earth’s Portal,** where people walk and ghosts move—**those who guard my body are the august and boundless Heaven.**\nToday’s Yu Step aligns with Heaven’s decree.\nGhosts and spirits submit as guests; below, all inauspiciousness is repelled.\nAll requests are fulfilled; ten thousand spirits dare not resist.\n**Chìduó!**\n*Note:* This is *Xuan* (玄).\nOne version reads: *\"This is I.\"*\n\nWithin my body, the five sufferings, eight hardships, nine calamities, a hundred illnesses, myriad disasters, malevolent men and evil spirits, scheming tongues and slanderous plots, Heaven’s nets and Earth’s cords—all are subdued beneath the *Kui Gang* (魁纲), motionless and inactive.\n**Swiftly, as per the newly issued edicts of the Old Lord.**\n\n**Fifth Incantation:**\n*Note:* The Yu Step incantation for averting calamity and seeking wishes, to be constantly practiced for longevity.\n\n**Qian Yuan Chong Fu,** Kun Da Hou Zai.\n*As recorded in The Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl, Upper Volume.*\n\nThe Later Sage instructed the Celestial Master:\n\n*\"The Five-Headed Incantation—if used merely to dispel calamity, only the third and second incantations need be recited. Then, with the Step of the Halter, you may gather and subdue the calamities. Spirits and humans alike will submit and rest.\n*Note:* This includes the first eight incantations in the Step of the Halter.\n\nThe Halter is the Northern Dipper’s Female Void, the Central Dipper—reversed three times, and the Yu Step three times, then cease.\n*Note:* Also, the *Supporting* technique must be employed.\n*Note:* The *Supporting* key.\n\nAfter three days, the calamity will disperse, and matters will settle—then do not employ the key.\n\nIf seeking longevity, then all nine later incantations may be fully used.\n*Note:* As recorded in *The Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl, Upper Volume.*\n\nBefore and after, [the incantations] are uttered in the Hall of Officials. The Celestial Master is invoked.\n\nIt is customary to dispel calamities on *jiǎzǐ* days. It is also said: If there is calamity or illness, use it immediately—it is not restricted to *jiǎzǐ*, *huìshuò*, or *gēngshēn* days. Within a month, one day per *xún* is practiced.\n*Note:* The Celestial Master practices two days per *xún* for longevity, aligning with the practice of the Central Dipper.\n\nAdditionally, on *gēngshēn* days, one’s natal days, and *liùjiǎ* days.\n*Note:* *Jiǎzǐ*, *jiǎxū*, *jiǎshēn*, *jiǎwǔ*, *jiǎchén*, and *jiǎyín* days.\n\nBefore practice, the Northern Dipper is cultivated, then the Central Dipper. There are separate scriptures for this, found in *The Flowing Pearl, Middle Volume*.\n*Note:* *The Golden Lock Scripture, Upper Volume* is in four volumes, while *The Flowing Pearl, Middle Volume* is in five.\n\nThis is the *Tàiwéi Heavenly Emperor*, the *Flying Step of the Halter*.\n*Note:* The sound of *gāngjì* is used, not the sound of *gāng* (rigid). The original Step of the *Gāng* is this very character.\n\nYu, in regulating the waters and ascending the mountains, established the rigid Step. Yu did not use it squarely but employed the *Stepping on the Earthly Gāng* technique—this is the character.\n\nThe scripture was transmitted by the Later Sage Lord, hence its name, *The Great Elixir Hidden Book*.\nAnciently, it was called *Yù Zhù*; the Later Sage Lord renamed it *Liúzhū*, and *Jīnzhù* became *Jīnsuǒ*.\nAnother name is *The Tàishàng Hidden Book*.\n*Note:* Some today do not recognize it.\"*\n\nThe Sixth Diagram of the Northern Dipper *Gāng* depicts seven stars, without auxiliary ministers. Beginning from the first star of the Dipper, the male steps forward with the left foot, reaching the Ox Star with the right foot.\n*Note:* This is the name of the Northern Dipper star, one of the Twenty-Eight Constellations.\n\nNext is the Female Star.\n*Note:* All movements follow the Dao of Heaven, with the left foot always stepping forward first. The Female Star requires the right foot to step forward first.\n\nNext is the Void, then Danger, then Room, and finally the Wall Star. The seven stars complete a full circuit with a leftward turn of the body.\n\n**Obsequy Ritual:** *\"Come to life, depart from death\"*—or *\"calamity departs, fortune arises.\"*\n*Note:* This is the forward progression.\n\nAgain, reverse the steps in a full circuit—beginning from the seventh star toward the first.\n\n**Return Step.**\n*Note:* From the first star toward the seventh.\n\nThis is then divided into **Yu’s Step to Seek the True**.\n\nNext is **Yu’s Step**—Yu performed the *Heavenly Gāng* and *Earthly Ji*, manifesting it as Yu’s Step to seek the True and restrain all things. Humans, gods, dragons, spirits, ghosts, insects, beasts, venomous serpents, and all monstrous things—all submit and are not slain. Those that resist are destroyed.\n\nIts principle involves combining five Dipper steps into three steps of nine traces, or thirty-five traces. The Great Yu’s Step consists of fifteen traces. These two grades of Yu’s Step are the inner secrets for averting disasters, escaping calamities, and entering the Dao of immortality.\n*Note:* Daoists know only of the *Flying Heavenly Gāng* technique but are unaware of the *Earthly Ji* and Yu’s Step. Using only the *Two-Sevens* method for two years without attaining divinity, they criticize it as unspiritual and unholy—a false claim against the scriptures of immortality.\n\nMoreover, the Later Sage Lord clearly revised and demonstrated the *Three-Five Golden Lock Flowing Pearl* text. The three—*One* (元), *Three Steps*, and *Gāng*—contain the secrets. At the moment of stepping, the Five-Colored Silk binds the secrets, held within the palm.\n\nIf seeking longevity, pinch the *Sìmìng* (司命) and *Three Officials* targets. For prohibitions, pinch the *certain object* targets. Against enemy armies, pinch the *Heavenly Soldiers* and *Great General* targets, etc.\n\n---\n**Golden Lock Flowing Pearl Preface (卷之一)**\n*Original Title:* Attributed to the Great True Master of China, Wang Fangping, Zhang Daoling, Zhao Sheng, Wang Chang, Sìmìng Li Zhongfu, Mao Ying, Xu Yufu, etc.—these are fabricated claims and unreliable.\n\nYet this book’s content is referenced in *The Sacred Traces of the Mixed Primordium*, suggesting it predates the Northern Song. Many annotations are self-attributed as *\"Wind-Read\"* (风读) and *\"Wind-Seen\"* (风见), likely linked to Li Chunfeng. The entire work consists of seventy-eight scrolls, detailing step-alignment, Dipper-treading, talisman-holding, incantations, summoning gods and ghosts, fasting and ritual rites, executing calamities, and dispelling illnesses. It synthesizes the techniques of the Celestial Master and Upper Clarity schools into one system, serving as a crucial document for studying pre-Northern Song Daoist practices.\n\n---\n**Preface to the *Tàishàng Sānwǔ Tàixuān Jīnzhù Liúzhū* (太玄金箓金锁流珠引序)**\n**Sequence by the Daoist Immortal Li Chunfeng**\n\nThe *Tàishàng Sānwǔ Tàixuān Jīnzhù* is the transmission from the **Primordial Beginning Heavenly Venerable** to the **Tàishàng Dàdào Jun** (太上大道君), also called the **Highest Holy Tàishàng Yùchén Xuánhuáng Dàdào Jun** (玉晨玄皇大道君).\n*Note:* A manifestation of the Primordial Beginning, or said to be a disciple of the Heavenly Venerable, ruling over all Dao.\n\nThe **Dàdào Jun** transmitted to the **Zǐqīng Tàisù Gāoxū Dòngyào Sānyuān Shàngdào Jun** (紫清太素高虚洞曜三元上道君), who transmitted to the **Zǐchén Tàiwéi Tiāndì Dàodào Jun** (紫晨太微天帝道君).\n*Note:* Also called the *Upper Clarity Most True Dao Venerable*, ruling over the Thirty-Six Heavens.\n\nThe **Dàodào Jun** transmitted to the **Zǐmíng Tàiwéi Jiǔdào Gāoyuán Yùchén Dàodào Jun** (紫明太微九道高元玉晨道君), who then transmitted to the **Tàishàng Lǎojūn**.\n*Note:* Some say Tàishàng Lǎojūn was a disciple of Tàishàng Dàodào Jun, not a teacher of Tiāndì. It should be the transmission to the *Tàipíng Jīnquè Dìchén Hòushèng Xuányuān Shàngdào Jun* (太平金阙帝晨后圣玄元上道君). This is also a manifestation of Tàishàng Lǎojūn, hence the name *Laozi* (老子) as a reincarnation, teaching the *Flowing Pearl Layered Years* method.\n\nUnder **Tiāndì Jun**, the **Yùchén Dàodào Jun** transmitted to the **Zǐyuán Tàiwéi Bāsù Sānyuān Xuánchén Yuánjūn** (紫元太微八素三元玄晨元君), who transmitted to the **Zǐwēi Yuánlíng Guītái Jiǔlíng Tàizhēn Yuánjūn** (紫微元灵龟台九灵太真元君).\n*Note:* This ruler instructs those in the world who study the True Dao.\n\nThe **Yuánjūn** transmitted to the **Dàlíng Shàngxiāo Féichén Zhōngyáng Huánglǎo Jun** (大灵上霄飞晨中央黄老君), who transmitted to the **Tàiyuán Dōngxiá Bósāng Dānlín Dàdì Shàngdào Jun** (太元东霞搏桑丹林大帝上道君). This Jun resided in Bósāng and transmitted to the Twenty-Four True Ones. The transmission was lost in Central Plains.\n\nThe **Zǐchén Tàiwéi Tiāndì Dàodào Jun** transmitted to the **Shàngqīng Tàipíng Jīnquè Dìchén Hòushèng Xuányuān Yùhuáng Shàngdào Jun** (上清太平金阙帝晨后圣玄元玉皇上道君).\n*Note:* Also called the *Great Dao Venerable of the Jade Emperor*.\n\nThis Jun governs the lower Ten Heavens, oversees the fate of all beings, and communicates with the Upper Clarity. As the Later Sage Lord, the **Forefather Tàishàng Dàodào Jun** was called the *Empty Sovereign* (虚皇), ruling all Dao. The **Later Sage Tàishàng Lǎojūn** was called the *Jade Sovereign* (玉皇), ruling all Dao.\n\nSince the establishment of the **Jīnquè Emperor**, officials and ministers were fully appointed, mirroring the hierarchical duties of mortal rulers. Each has its domain, encompassing the Nine Wilds and all Heavens.\n\nThe Jun’s surname is **Li**, given name **Dān**, and courtesy name **Bóyáng**. He renamed the *Golden Lock* as the *Tàixuān Sānwǔ Jīnsuǒ Liúzhū Jīngzhù*, formally expounding the essentials of the Dipper Step and Gāng alignment.\n\nThe *Jīngzhù* consists of eighty-six chapters and forty-three volumes. Presented to the **Tàishàng Lǎojūn**, also called the **Highest Holy Tàishàng Yùchén Xuánhuáng Dàdào Jun**, who then transmitted it to mortals as the true sovereign and true ministers, wishing to save the Ten Heavens.\n*Note:* The Nine Wilds, including the lower celestial realms, are called the Ten Heavens. The world is the Upper Heavenly Daoist Capital, the *Jade Emperor’s Divine Sovereign*.\n\nHe compiled a concise fifteen-volume core scripture, along with manuals and diagrams on palm-secrets, discussing the alignment of steps and the treading of *Ji*. Collectively, these are titled the *Golden Lock Great Name*, followed by *Flowing Pearl*, *Flying Step Heavenly Gāng*, and finally *Yu’s Step Earthly Ji*.\n\nThe *Jīngzhù* passed twenty volumes to **Emperor Yīn**, who was titled the **Posterior Sage Great Master Left Supreme Minister**.\n\nThe **Minister** transmitted them to the **Great True Persons of the Schools**, all of whom assisted the **Posterior Sage**. The **Sage** then transmitted them to the **Posterior Sage Master**—*Note:* this is the **Celestial Master**—the **Left True Guardian of Tàiwēi**, the **Imperial Preserver of the Dao**, who was the **Lord of the Nine Heavens Above the Three Heavens**.\n\nThe **Posterior Sage** further transmitted them to the **Nine-Mysteries Supreme True Lord**, the **Jade Gate Supreme Attendant**, the **Grand Marshal of the High Command**, the **Morning Sage Master of the Eastern Sea**, the **Lord of Jade Clarity and Azure Splendor**, the **Young Daoist of the Little Palace**.\n\n*Note:* This title belongs to those who teach and attain the **True Persons**.\n\nFor those with the resolve to cultivate it, they may receive the **True Transmission of the Dao** and become ministers of the **Jade Gate Golden Palace**, the **Posterior Sage Jade Emperor**, who eternally descends among the immortals.\n\nThe **Posterior Sage Master** then transmitted them to the **Supreme Protector of the Limbs**—*Note:* the **Master** conferred this rank—**Lord of the South Pole Great Cinnabar**, **Purple Primordial Lady**, and her **Purple-Mysteries Consort**, surnamed **Lǐ**, the **Posterior Sage Master’s** third daughter, who once served **Emperor Qīnghé**—*Note:* this is **Fāngpíng**—as a **Young Attendant**.\n\n「For those who are **True Daoists** and attain **True Persons**, the **Posterior Sage Master** appointed the son as the **Prime Minister of the Zhou Mù King**—*Note:* his name was **Zhòngchūn**—serving for only one hundred years. Yet his nature did not align with **Dao/Way** in attaining **virtue/power**, and the **Purple-Mysteries Consort** urged him to practice the **Law of the Treaded Dipper**—*Note:* this refers to the **Flying Steps Technique**—but he did not follow.\n\nThe **Posterior Sage Master** then transmitted the **Supreme True Lord of White Mountain**—*Note:* to instruct the same teachings as the **King of the Yellow Emperor**—and further conferred the **Supreme Prime Minister**—*Note:* the **Prime Minister of the Dao** is a rank where the disciple attains the **True Persons** position, akin to the worldly **Chancellor and Prime Minister**.—**True Lord of the South Pole and South Mountain**, surnamed **Zuò**, the **Supreme True Lord of Azure Mystery**.\n\n*Note:* For those who teach and guide disciples to become **True Persons**, they are first petitioned to the **Golden Dipper** and then granted **Dao/Way**, rank, and titles.\n\nThe **Supreme True Lord of the South Pole and South Mountain** further transmitted the **Right Minister of the Five Peaks**, surnamed **Tóngbì**, the **True Lord of the Five Peaks**, who assisted the **Posterior Sage Jade Emperor**. The **Posterior Sage Jade Emperor** then bestowed upon **Mystic Territory**—*Note:* also written as **Mystic State**—the **Twenty-Nine True Persons**.\n\n*Note:* These **True Persons** are responsible for petitioning the names of **Daoists** to the heavens. If one’s merit does not meet the standards after three trials, they are first petitioned to the **Posterior Sage Jade Emperor**, who may then grant **Daoist** titles and ranks based on their merit. These **True Persons** oversee the nine realms and myriad lands of the lower world, commanding mountains and waters, and are known by the names of mortals. The **Little Attendant** governs **Qín, Chǔ, and the Southern Seas**; the **Great Attendant** governs **Yān and Qí**; the **Western Spirit Attendant** governs **Sòng, Wèi, Zhèng, and Liáng**. The **Great Attendant** also oversees the **Eastern Seas Administration**.\n\nFor those who have attained **virtue/power** in the **Dao/Way** and become **Daoists** or **True Persons** in the various regions, upon being heard by the **Supreme Protector of the Golden Dipper**, the **Posterior Sage Master**, they are commanded to teach and test others. Those who pass are granted **Dao/Way** according to their merit, and those who attain **Daoist** status are granted **True Persons** rank.\n\nAmong these three categories, the first rank are those who cultivate their bodies with restraint, act prudently, speak truthfully without deceit, refine their **True Heart**, delight in **Daoist** classics, and recite them to fulfill **virtue/power**. They maintain incense and lamps continuously, healing others’ afflictions. If they encounter the **Six Auspicious Talismans** and practice them over many years, they may even attain **immortality**, becoming **Daoists** among mortals. Further cultivation may lead them to meet a **Daoist Master**, who then grants them this **Scripture and Diagram**, allowing them to practice the **Flying Steps Technique** and thus become **True Persons** and **Daoist Immortals**.\n\nThe second rank are those who refine **gold and stone elixirs**, using them as medicines of ultimate **Daoist** attainment to heal others’ illnesses, strengthen their bodies, and regulate their **organs and meridians**—*Note:* **藏** here refers to **organs and meridians**.—They take these elixirs in secluded mountain forests and thus live far beyond the **Ten Thousand Years**, dying not before a hundred years. Even after death, they do not become lower ghosts but are reborn, receiving their original blessings.\n\nThe third rank are those who sincerely aspire to the **Dao/Way**, following a **Clear Master** without hesitation, even traveling ten thousand miles. They offer their **heart** and exert their **virtue/power** without sparing effort or labor. Over long years and months, the **Master** will naturally record their **virtue/power** and merit, then teach them this **Scripture**, transmitting it afterward. Those who sincerely cultivate will reap **virtue/power** from their **Master** first and be petitioned to the **Posterior Sage**. Many are then granted **Daoist** titles and ranks, becoming **True Persons**.\n\nThese three categories were taught by the **Posterior Sage Master**—*Note:* **Zhang the Daoist Master**—and the **Supreme True Lord of the Golden Dipper**. The **Posterior Sage Master** also instructed the **Purple-Mysteries Left Consort**—*Note:* For those who teach and guide disciples to become **True Persons**, after three successful trials, they are first petitioned to the **Golden Dipper**, granted **Daoist** titles, and conferred as **True Persons**.\n\nThe **Posterior Sage Master** further descended to instruct the **Twenty-Four True Persons**, who ascended to the heavens as **Twenty-Four Supreme True Lords of the Left and Right Golden Dippers**. *Note:* These **True Persons** oversee the affairs of all the heavens and earth, the living populace, and determine the merit of those who attain **True Persons** rank, as well as the depth of their cultivation over years and months, petitioning their degrees and commendations.\n\nThe **Posterior Sage Master** also appointed the **Supreme True Lord** to oversee trials and conferred upon **Máo Yíng** and **Lǐ Zhòngfǔ**—*Note:* **Máo** and **Lǐ** are **Daoist Masters**—and others as **Lords of Fate**. *Note:* They lead and instruct those who follow the **Dao/Way** to become **True Persons**, testing them. Those who pass are taught accordingly.\n\n**Máo Yíng** instructed his two brothers, **Máo Zǐfǔ** and **Lǐ Zhòngfǔ**, as well as **Yáng Zuǒ**’s six disciples, all of whom were granted the **Scripture** and taught to practice it. Later, all **Daoists** and **True Persons** from the various regions attained their ranks through this **Scripture**.\n\nSome were transmitted by the **Supreme Daoist Lord of the Highest Venerable**, others by the **Supreme Daoist Lord of the Great Prime Minister of the Anterior Sage**, or by the **Posterior Sage Mystic Jade Emperor** through a **divided body transmission**. Some were conferred by the **Supreme Daoist Master of the Posterior Sage**, who served as the **Supreme True Lord**, granting them **ascension to celestial abodes** and elevating their families to immortality as well.\n\nThe multitude of **True Persons** and **Daoists** thus attained became countless—some numbering in the hundreds of millions, others seen ascending in broad daylight. Their numbers were so vast that they cannot be recorded one by one.\n\nNow, I shall briefly enumerate them in sequence, using them as introductory titles for those who follow, detailing the transmissions from the **Anterior Sage’s Golden Mouth** and the **Posterior Sage’s Golden Mouth** in the *Golden Talisman, Jade Diagram, Flowing Pearl, and Induction*.\n\nNext, I employ the combined methods of the Anterior and Posterior Sages, arranging the titles according to their prescribed order, dividing each into diagrams, and extracting their essential secrets and inner precepts to guide practitioners into the **Great Dao’s** gate. Those who cultivate and attain it shall, in turn, transmit it to future generations of worthy disciples—those whose hearts and spirits align with **Daoist transcendence**. None may recklessly transmit this to the unworthy.\n\nThis **Black Script** was granted by **Laozi**, while the **Red Script** was reaffirmed by the **Posterior Sage Emperor**. The **Celestial Master** received this instruction, and **King Wáng** recorded it, with each detail annotated in the subsequent chapters and paired with the respective scrolls.\n\n**Preface to the *Great Dao’s Three Pure Ones, Golden Lock, and Flowing Pearl Genealogy***\n\nThe terms *Golden Lock* originated when **Yǐn Jun** transmitted them to **Wáng Jun**, who then passed on the term *Flowing Pearl*.\n\n**Wáng Jun** asked: *\"What is the meaning of *Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl*?\"*\n\n**Yǐn Jun** replied: *\"The **Supreme Venerable Laozi**, upon returning to his **True Emperor** rank, was titled **Highest Pure Emperor of the Golden Threshold, Celestial Master**. When **Wáng Jun** instructed his disciple **Wáng Èr Jūn**—\n*(Note: The first Wáng is **Wáng Cháng**, the second is **Wáng Zǐdēng**.)*\n—he said: The **Anterior Sage’s Void Emperor, Great Dao Lord** is none other than the **Primordial Supreme Dao Lord**. The **Posterior Sage’s Jade Emperor, Mysterious Origin Supreme Dao Lord**—\n*(Note: Also called the **Supreme Great Dao Lord**, corresponding to the Anterior rank.)*\n—was renamed from *Golden Talisman* to *Golden Lock*.\n\nIts original intent was to teach the method of **locking the soul and refining the spirit**, seeking life and avoiding death. It spoke of **fortifying the body like gold** and **retaining the spirit like a lock**.\n*(Note: Another version says, \"Retaining the spirit as a lock, hence *Golden Lock*.\" This was from the old *Golden Talisman* teachings.)*\n\nWhen reciting aloud the *Golden Lock*,\n*(Note: The name *Golden Lock* signifies the inherent principle of the self, aiding the realm to save others.)*\nand when walking in *Golden Halter steps*,\n*(Note: Stepping the Heavenly Halter, treading the Earthly Measures.)*\nthese two terms were bestowed upon later worthies, clarifying their names so that practitioners might attain the **Dao** in their time.\n\n**Wáng Jun** asked again: *\"Why is it called *Flowing Pearl*?\"*\n\n**Yǐn Jun** replied: *\"The *Flowing Pearl* refers to the **Nine Stars of the Northern Dipper**.*\n*(Note: Though seven stars are visible, two are unseen, totaling nine.)*\nPractitioners, through their cultivation and stepping the Halter, are said to *flow and turn like pearls*.*\n*(Note: The nightly rotation of the Dipper encircles the heavens endlessly, like unceasing flowing water, and the stars resemble pearls, hence *Flowing Pearl*.)*\nOriginally, this was called the *Golden Talisman’s Method*.\n*(Note: The old *Golden Talisman* text states, \"The Method locks the spirit.\" These four characters were its opening.)*\nThe **Posterior Sage Emperor** renamed the *Method* as *Flowing Pearl*, which is now the *Seven-Star Flying Step*, paired with the *Nine-Dipper Robe*, used to subdue evil and rectify inversions.\n\nThe **Supreme Venerable Yǐn True Person** transmitted the four characters *Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl* to the **Posterior Sage Emperor**, pointing to the **Three Pure Ones**—\n*(Note: The **Jade Pure, Highest Pure, and Supreme Pure**.)*\n—the **Celestial Master** composed the *Three Pure Ones’ Sequence*, **Yǐn True Person** wrote the *Three Pure Ones’ Words*, and **Wáng Jun** sang the *Three Pure Ones’ Song*.\n*(Note: All speak of deriving *One* to attain *Three*, *Three* to attain *Five*, *Five* to attain *Seven*, and *Seven* to attain *Nine*—this refers to the three celestial yang numbers, culminating at *Nine*.)*\n\nThe **Supreme One** above is **Taiyi**,\n*(Note: The One Heaven.)*\nwhile the **Two Principles** below encompass **Earth**.\n*(Note: Earth.)*\nThe **Two Principles** generate the **Four Symbols**, the **Four** generate the **Six**, the **Six** generate the **Eight**, and the **Eight** generate the **Ten**.\n*(Note: All originate from the **Dao** and represent the extreme yin numbers.)*\n\nThe **Emperor of Jade Pure** is the **Void Emperor, Great Dao Lord**.\n*(Note: The title of **Primordial**.)*\nThe **Middle Emperor of Jade Pure** is the **High Emperor, Supreme Dao Lord**.\n*(Note: The title of **Supreme Dao Lord**.)*\nThe **High Emperor** above is the **Supreme Dao Lord**.\n*(Note: The **Supreme Dao Lord**.)*\nThe **Highest Pure** above and the **Jade Pure** below is the **Jade Emperor**.\n*(Note: **Supreme Venerable Laozi**.)*\nIt is also said: The **Posterior Sage’s Peaceful Emperor**.\nThe **Supreme Pure** above and the **Highest Pure** below is the **Heavenly Emperor, Taiyi Venerable Sovereign**.\n*(Note: The **Taiyi Dao Lord**.)*\nIt is also said: **Taiyi, the Master of Heaven**, the **Supreme Extremity’s Venerable Sovereign**, called **Heaven**, the **Dao’s Son**.\n\nThose who study the **Dao** must know the **Three Pure Ones’ true sovereigns** to learn from the **Posterior Sage Emperor**, the current **Highest Pure’s sovereign**. The **Supreme Pure’s Taiyi Lord**—\n*(Note: The **Heavenly Sovereign**.)*\n—is the sovereign.\n\nAll petitions must first pass through the **Supreme Pure**, enter the **Highest Pure**, and then be registered with the **Daoist name**.\n*(Note: Also, first register in the **Supreme Pure**, then proceed to the **Highest Pure**, submitting the **Golden Seal**.)*\n\nThe **Posterior Sage Emperor** instructed the **True Persons**: *\"To seek the **True Dao**, one must first practice the **Yǔ Step**, which is the **Heavenly Halter**.*\n*(Note: *Yǔ* means *garment*. Originally the character for *feather*. This is the correct pronunciation. Because **Yǔ** of the Xia Dynasty mastered water control, he encountered this **Heavenly Halter Step Method**. After four years of cultivation, he attained the **Dao**, commanding dragons, tigers, and spirits to dredge rivers and regulate the waters, earning merit. Later, he became a **Sage and True Person**, and his name was changed to *Yǔ*. After fulfilling his earthly merit, thirty years later, he ascended in flesh. **Yǔ** is now the **Supreme Extremity True Person**, whom the ministers occasionally see. His sister also departed. His robes and cap were buried at **Kuàijī Mountain**, where a temple remains in his honor. His name may be inscribed among the **Three Pure Ones**.)*\n\nIf one walks the **Heavenly Halter in emptiness** but does not know the **Yǔ Step’s Method**, they cannot ascend to the **Three Pure Ones**, nor will their names be recorded there. The **Underworld** will not register them, and the **Celestial Bureaus** will have no record of them.\n*(Note: Though humans are born of Heaven, they are nurtured by Earth. Life and death are decreed by Heaven, but merit and vice depend on Earth. The enlightened of Earth must first be subdued.)*\n\n「Thus, the **Heavenly Halter** is mastered by subduing the **Earthly Halter**, and the **Yǔ Step** is achieved by following the **Heavenly Halter’s Method**. The spirit and vitality are thereby tamed.\n\nThose who do not know this Dao cannot pay homage to the **Three Pure Ones**. The original *Sutra of the Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl*—which originates from **Great Dao Lord of Jade Purity**—was initially named *The Inner Canon of Golden Talisman and Jade Talisman*.\n*(Note: The Celestial Sovereign named it *The Golden Talisman and Jade Talisman*.)*\n\nLater sages renamed it *The Golden Lock Sutra* and *The Flowing Pearl Sutra*, thus passing it down. This is the second scroll of *The Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl*.\n\nThe **Great Sovereign of Total Perfection, Zhāng Dàolíng, Zhào Shēng, Wáng Cháng, Lǐ Zhòngfǔ, Máo Yíng, Xǔ Yùfǔ**, and others are successive authors who compiled it. **Li Chūnfēng**, the Daoist sage, annotated it.\n\n**The Diagram of Three Steps and Nine Traces**\nThis diagram was taught by **Laozi** to **Yǔ**; it depicts the **Yǔ Step** of three steps and nine traces.\n*(Note: **Yǔ** first tamed the **Earthly Halter**, completing the three matters of **advancing, retreating, and reversing**, then proceeded with the two feet.)*\n\nWhether the **Yǔ Step** is large or small, the two matters (advancing and retreating) are unnecessary if one wishes to **ascend to the Pole Star**. Simply follow the diagram’s prescribed method.\n\nThe **Yǔ Step** (right and left) is used to seek longevity and avert calamities. Later sages instructed the **Celestial Master**, initially teaching the **Heavenly Halter’s Method**, then refining it into the **Nine Traces**. This also aligns with **Pole Star numerology**.\n\nThe three matters of **advancing, retreating, and reversing** are completed in three rounds.\n*(Note: Three rounds of the **Heavenly Halter** are inferior to the **Three Halters and Three Degrees**—the **Yǔ Step** must be performed right and left in three rounds.)*\n\nIf one desires swift results and effective practice, they should perform three steps of the **Heavenly Halter’s Method**, advancing and retreating once each. Boys advance left, girls advance right.\n*(Note: After completing right and left, one more round must be done—totaling three.)*\n\nThis is the successive **advancing, retreating, and reversing** in three rounds.\n\nIf one wishes to **subdue malevolence and deploy martial methods**, or fears calamities, they should practice the **Yǔ Step of the Twenty-Eight Constellations**.\n\nAfter completing the **Heavenly Halter** in one hundred steps, within thirty-five days, its efficacy may be tested by **water and fire**.\n*(Note: According to **Laozi’s** initial instruction to **Yǔ**, the **Pole Star Method** was perfected later, and only the **Yǔ Step** remains. The **Twenty-Eight Constellations** were later taught to **Wáng Jūn**.)\n\nBegin with the **Northern Pole**, then proceed to the **Eastern Pole**, the **Southern Pole**, and the **Western Pole**, finally ascending to the **Central Pole** without stepping on the **True Person Star**.\n\nTreading the **Northern Pole** seeks the **Law of the Pole**, reciting the **Deciphering of Jiazi**. The **Eastern Pole** recites the **Deciphering of Jia-yin**, the **Southern Pole** the **Deciphering of Jia-wu**, the **Western Pole** the **Deciphering of Jia-shēn**, and the **Central Pole** the **Decipherings of Jia-xū and Jia-chén**. These are the **Pole Star Decipherings** corresponding to their directions.\n\nFor longevity practice, mark the **Deciphering of the Life Officer** with red ink, or bind it with five-colored silk threads, then perform the **Heavenly Halter**. After three years, one attains **Earthly True Personhood**, reaching the point where the **Life Officer** descends to remove one’s name from the **Register of the Dead**.\n*(Note: Those born under Jiazi and similar **Metal** signs use **Ding-sì (丙午、丁巳)** as the **Life Officer**. Wood-born individuals use **Gēng-shēn and Xīn-xǔ (庚申、辛酉)**; water-born use **Wù-chén and Jǐ-wèi (戊辰、己未)**; fire-born use **Rén-zǐ and Guǐ-hài (壬子、癸亥)**; earth-born use **Jiā-yín and Yǐ-mǎo (甲寅、乙卯)**. These are used in practice.)*\n\nIn all three grades of this **Heavenly Halter** practice, one must recite the **Nine Post-Step Invocations** afterward.\n*(Note: After the invocation, retain the **Twenty-Eight Constellations** in the body as per the diagram. The diagram is found in *The Third Central Element Diagram of the Golden Lock*.)*\n\nThe **Twelve Post-Step Invocations** are incorporated into the three pre-existing ones, and their names must also be recited.\n\nFirst, after one step and one round, invoke:\n*\"In days of old, I received instruction from the **Mysterious Sage**,\nwho taught me the **Heavenly Halter’s Method**—\nall my requests are fulfilled.\nThus it is spoken.\"*\n\nAfter one round of the **Heavenly Halter**, *(Note: Invoke while stepping on the **Pole Star**.)*\ninvoke:\n*\"The **Five Phases** mutually generate.\nThus it is spoken.\"*\n\nAfter two rounds of the **Heavenly Halter**, *(Note: Invoke after two rounds of the **Pole Star**.)*\ninvoke:\n*\"The **Five Phases** mutually generate.\nThus it is spoken.\"*\n\nThen recite the **Heavenly Key Deciphering**, briefly.\n\nFourth, three steps toward **Kui**, one round of the **Earthly Halter**. *(Note: Three rounds of stepping, performed in reverse.)*\nInvoke:\n*\"In days of old, I received instruction from the **Mysterious Sage**,\nwho taught me to tread the **Earthly Halter** and master the **Heavenly Halter**.\nThus it is spoken.\"*\n\nRecite the **Decipherings of the Grand Prohibition and Grand Sage**.\n\nFifth, three steps toward **Kui**, one round of the **Earthly Halter**. *(Note: In the third round of stepping, advance from the **seventh star** toward **Kui Star**.)*\nInvoke:\n*\"The **Three Five** form the **Weft**,\nwithin which the **Thread** is named **Qi**.\nThus it is spoken.\"*\n\n*(Note: **Disaster points**—for **Metal-born**, disaster lies in **Fire**.)*\n\nSixth, one round toward **Kui**, piercing and subduing malevolence, **souls and ghosts**. The calamities of the **Five Phases** will return to strike the one who summoned them.\n*(Note: **Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth**—**Metal** always fears **Fire** as **ghost**, hence the **Heavenly Halter** subdues **Fire** and seeks **Earth** as the remedy, turning misfortune into fortune.)*\n\nInvoke using the **Five Phases Invocation**:\n*\"The **Five Phases** mutually generate;\nthe **Heavenly Halter** holds supreme authority.\nThus it is spoken.\"*\n\nRecite the **Ghost Deciphering**.\n*(Note: After the invocation, add *\"Today, I tread **Kui**—all matters are auspicious.\"* The piercing follows the diagram: **soul above, ghost below**.)*\n\n*(Note: This is the **subduing of malevolence**; do not practice recklessly. If practicing for longevity, perform it as **Three Elements**.)*\n*(Note: **Heaven, Earth, Water**. The **Five Phases** below are **Wood, Metal, Water, Fire, Earth**—those that harm my body must be countered through the **Heavenly Halter** and **Earthly Halter**.)*\n\n*(Note: Even if calamities manifest in sound alone without physical form, one can endure them and attain eternal longevity.)*\n\nThe remaining invocations and piercings are all explained similarly.\n\nFor the **left foot**, step on the **□ Star** to pierce **ghosts**; the **left foot** again advances in **Ding** sequence, retaining the posture as if seated toward the **□ Star**, advancing to the **□** to pierce malevolence.\n*(Note: Recite the **Ghost and Malevolence Deciphering** and the **Force Support Deciphering**. Below, strike with the **left fist** as if weighing fifteen *jīn*. Above, use the **right hand**.)*\n*(Note: Follow the upper method.)*\n\n**Seventh [Step]:**\nWhen passing through **Wuqi**, pierce, step, and invoke—beginning from the **first star** and the **second star** of the **Gang**.\n*(Note: With the **left hand’s sword**, pierce the malevolent influences of the Five Phases clashing against you to dispel calamity. Then ascend to the **fourth star**, seize the malevolence, and strike with **seven fists**.)\n*(Note: Each fist weighs **fifteen *jīn***.)*\nRecite the invocation:\n*\"The Five Phases push the Gang,\nHolding supreme authority over the Six *Ji*.\"*\n*(And so forth.)*\nTwist the **Five Phases’ palace** to nurture my body, along with the **Two Decipherings of the Marshal of Destiny**—this brings auspiciousness.\nUse the **Entry of the Army** only to aid others and the state; store the remaining strikes, and do not act recklessly. Even minor malevolence or evil spirits must not be trodden upon with **Heavenly Mechanics**.\n\n**Eighth [Step]:**\nPass through **Gang** once, step on **Ji**, and pierce—retracing from the **seventh star** to the **□ third star**, seizing the **Heavenly Killer** and malevolent ghosts that are incompatible with my body.\nWith the **left fist** and **right stomp**, each stomp weighs **twenty-five *jīn***.

They divided the **symbols** and **broken seals**, swearing an oath to the **Two Heavens**.\n\nThe **master and disciple** awaited each other within the **altar hall**. One by one, they invoked the **generals’ names** and transmitted the **Dao-scriptures** to the disciple, who received them in response. After receiving, they must not act recklessly.\n\nThe **Elemental Command** required piercing the hand to draw blood, which was mixed with water. The **master and disciple** drank it as an oath.\nThey bound their hair into **knots**, tied **girdles** as vows, and swore not to betray the **Way of the master and friends**, nor to betray the **Three Officials**.\nIf they violated this, their **bodies would be examined**, and the **Record-Keepers and Soldiers** would first sit in judgment of their crimes—how could one not be cautious?\nThus, they took oaths to **preserve their bodies**.\n\nThis is the **method of the Dao-scriptures**.\n\nThis text originally had **1,790 volumes**, named **Taiyi** (Great Unity), called the **Heavenly Teachings**. The threefold method is called the **Three Officials' Dao-scriptures**, and the fivefold method is called the **Five Phases Dao-scriptures**. Their three-and-fivefold methods are divided into **upper, middle, and lower** grades of practice.\n\nThe **Dao/Way of Cultivation** section is the **upper grade**. The **Heavenly and Human Beings** practice the **middle grade**, while the **Immortal Ones of the World** cultivate the **lower grade**. Thus, through the **Three Officials' Dao-scriptures**, one ascends from **lower-grade True Immortals** to **middle-grade Daoists**, then to **upper-grade Heavenly Immortals**.\n\nThe common folk dwell in the **lower realm**, so they first receive the **lower-grade Dao-scriptures** of True Immortals, and their cultivation progresses toward the middle and upper grades. This book completes the **upper extreme** of the upper grade, the **middle extreme** of the middle grade, and the **lower extreme** of the lower grade, and is titled *The Inner Canon of Taiyi’s Three-Five Golden Dao-scriptures and Jade Dao-scriptures*.\n\n**Note:** Later sages revised this to the **Zhengyi Dao-scriptures**, naming it *The Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl*.\n\nLater sages, when transmitting the **Zhengyi True Person**, **Note:** This refers to **Zhang the Dao-Master**, titled **Zhengyi True Person**. Then, based on the name of the **Three-Five**, established the **Zhengyi** title. The threefold refers to the **Three Officials**, and the fivefold refers to the **Five Phases**.\n\nThe **essence of Heaven and Earth**, also the **Five Spirits** of humankind.\n**Note:** The Five Phases manifest in Heaven as the **Five Stars**, on Earth as the **Five Sacred Peaks**, and in humans as the **Five Zang Organs**. If one can **calm the mind and stabilize** the **Five Zang Organs**, the **Five Phases’ divine essences** will always be present, and the **Sacred Furnace** will never fail or decay. This is the **True Person’s eternal life and deathlessness**, called the **Five Spirits**.\n\nThose who master the **Three-Five Dao-scriptures** attain **eternal life**. This is the **Zhengyi Dao-scripture**, originally **1,790 volumes** with **3,624 stages**, later classified by the sages as the **Three Officials' section**. The **upper grade** is named **Upper Official**, overseeing Heaven.\n**Note:** This should be the **upper-grade Great Truth, Great Spirit, Great Immortal** multitudes, all with Dao-scriptures and officials overseeing them. Three **Great Generals’ Dao-scriptures** are placed, leading **1,360 stages** of Dao-scriptures.\n**Note:** **224 stages** are transmitted to the **lower Earthly Caverns**, with **120 stages** manifesting in the world. Those in the world who attain these will all hold **heavenly and immortal official ranks**, becoming **eternally living True Persons**. If they lack or fall short, they will not attain eternal life.\n\nThe **Middle Official** oversees humanity, also with three **Great Generals**, leading **1,000 stages** of Dao-scriptures.\n**Note:** **560 stages** are transmitted to the **lower Earthly Caverns**, with **248 stages** manifesting among humanity. Those in the world who attain these will all hold **True Official ranks**. If they lack or fall short for long, they will not be **transmitted into the world**.\n\nThe **Lower Official** oversees Earth and Water, also with three **Great Generals**, leading **1,152 stages** of Dao-scriptures.\n**Note:** **872 stages**. Transmitted to the **lower Earthly Caverns**, with **550 stages** manifesting among humanity. Those in the world who attain these will all hold **Earthly Immortal ranks**. If they lack or fall short, they will not attain **prolonged lifespan** or **transformation into noble families**.\n\nThese are divided into the **Three Officials’ section**, with the **Three Officials’ Generals** guarding internally, **nurturing the body and saving lives**. The **Three Officials** oversee externally, **expelling demons and commanding spirits**, **restraining and guiding people**. All are under the authority of the **Three Officials and Five Stars**, all kept secret in the **upper heavens**.\n\nThe **Zhengyi Dao-scriptures** total **3,624 stages**. Those in the lower realm who know of their existence may also enter the ranks of **eternally living persons**. How much more so for those who receive transmission and retain or manifest the stages in the world, who become **Daoists**. Beyond ten years of practice, they ascend in broad daylight to the **True Heaven**.\n\nLater sages again declare: Those in the world who practice and attain the **upper-grade stages** hold **Heavenly Immortal ranks**, those who attain the **middle-grade stages** hold **Immortal ranks among humanity**, and those who attain the **lower-grade stages** hold **Earthly Immortal ranks**. Those who attain all three grades will hold **Heavenly Immortal official ranks**, the **True Person’s station**, and upon fulfilling their merit, ascend in broad daylight.\n\nIf one encounters a **non-Daoist**, whatever is seen or heard must be answered with **falsehoods**—but one must **not speak**, only respond with other words. This is called the **Golden Lock**. Thus, the **original Dao of Heavenly and Human Immortals** was revised, naming it *The Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl*.\n\nThe **Three-Five Dao-scriptures** are the **foundational teachings** for initial reception.\n**Note:** The **Taiyi** refers to the original **Upper Clarity Taiuan Dao-scriptures**.\n\nThe **Dao/Laozi** took the name **Taiyi Dao-scriptures**, establishing three grades. The **Zhengyi Later Sage** again declares: **Zheng** means **rectifying the heart**.\n\nThe **One** refers to the **unification of the Dao**. **Note:** Master Lu’s interpretation: *Rectify the heart, take the Dao from its Oneness*—the Dao’s nature is free from bias, surpassing even rectitude of heart.\n\nIf one can **embrace uprightness in resolve and conduct**, without generating **two or three** (i.e., duality or deviation), then the Dao will never leave the **rectified heart-nature**. Hence the scripture states: *\"The Dao generates the One.\"*\n\nThe name **Zhengyi** encompasses the **Three-Five** divisions. **Note:** The **Upper Division** is the **Upper Clarity** (Taiqing); the **Middle Division** is the **Middle Clarity** (Zhongyuan); the **Lower Division** is the **Lower Clarity** (Xianyuan), following the **Five Adaptations**. The **Upper Division** speaks of **Upper Clarity**, the **Middle Division** of **Zhengyi**, **Note:** *Zhengyi* addresses matters of the **human body**, hence it is placed in the **Middle Clarity** of the **Middle Division**. The *Lingbao Wufu* and *Wuyue Zhenxing Tu* discuss the **laws of the Earthly realm**, thus they belong to the **Lower Clarity** of the **Lower Division**.\n\nThe **Lower Division** speaks of the **Five Laws**. At the time when the **Later Sage** transmitted his teachings, there were **three divisions** entrusted to **Grandmaster Fang Ping**, numbered **256**, called the **Three Clarities** (*Sanyuan*), and the **Three Clarities Ritual** (*Sanyuan zhai*) was established. **Note:** *This transmission occurred on the fifteenth day of the first month of the fourth year of King Zhao of Qin’s reign.*\n\nThe **Master of the Reed** (Maojun) rejoiced at this time, and together with **70 volumes**, ascended as an **Immortal**—the **Grandmaster** became a **True Person** (*Zhenren*) alone. The teachings were divided into the **Three Clarities Dao-scriptures**, **Note:** *The 'laws' (*fa*) refer to scriptures, without the historical records of Generals Shishi and Bingjun or the names of gods and Immortals. The 'Dao-scriptures' (*lu*) are the Heavenly Talismans, inscribed with Heaven’s writings, commanding Heaven’s spirits; the talismans are written in bold, crimson script, their forms vivid and striking. Above, they rectify Heaven; in the middle, they rectify humans and subdue spirits; below, they constrain and govern the *qi* of earthly waters, dragons, ghosts, and rebellious demons, compelling them to return to the **True Dao**.*—thus named **Heaven, Earth, and Human**.\n\nThe **Upper Clarity** constrains Heaven, transmitting **Upper Clarity Dao-scriptures**. **Note:** *The Upper Clarity scriptures, laws, and Dao-scriptures all belong to the Upper Clarity division, with 360 stages of form and shadow.*\n\nThe **Middle Clarity** subdues spirits and aids humans, extending to **healing diseases and assisting the nation**.\n\nThe **Lower Clarity** governs the **Earthly Waters Dao-scriptures**, commanding the *qi* of earthly waters, gods, ghosts, and rebellious demons, using them to **protect people and repel calamities**—this is the application of the **Lower Clarity laws**.\n\nThe **Later Sage** declared: The **Upper Clarity laws** are overseen by the **Heavenly Officials**, the **Middle Clarity laws** by the **Human Body Middle Immortal Spirit Officials**, and the **Lower Clarity laws** by the **Earthly Waters Middle Immortal Spirit Officials**. Each has its **commanding generals and soldiers**, to constrain the spirits and gods of the **Three Clarities**, ensuring they do not harm **humans and Heaven**. Thus, the **Supreme Sage** established the **Three-Five Dao-scriptures and diagrams** of **Zhengyi**.\n\n**Note:** *Zhengyi means rectifying the heart and taking the Dao, without any duality or deviation, hence the name Zhengyi.*\n\nThe **Later Sage**, seeing that the **great Dao’s gateways** were becoming numerous, feared that later disciples might be confused in their **initial resolve**, and lose their **true nature**. Thus, he petitioned the **Supreme Dao/Way Lord** before him, requesting a change of the names of the **Golden Dao-scriptures** and **Jade Dao-scriptures**, to instruct the **lower realms’ people**—those who **unified their hearts in reverence and faith**, entering a **single gateway** for **precise cultivation**, would then **attain the Dao** and be named **Zhengyi**.\n\nThis law is **one-way in rectifying the heart**, seeking **cultivation of the utmost truth**, not through **deviant perceptions** that confuse the resolve, but by **meritorious deeds** to attain the Dao. It is **not about abandoning wives and children**, nor **refraining from grains and dwelling in mountains**, nor **abandoning office and secluding oneself**—only later does one **ascend the Dao**.\n\nThe **Later Sage** served as **Prime Minister three times**, and for **750 years** under the **Yin and Zhou dynasties**, attending to **64 Heavenly Sovereigns**, before ascending as the **Supreme Clarity Emperor of the Golden Gate** and **Later Sage Lord of Jade Sovereignty**, **Upper Dao Lord** (*Xuan Yuan Yu Huang Shang Dao Jun*). Could he have attained this through **mountain forests**, abandoning wives and children, refraining from grains, or secluding himself from the world?\n\nThe **gateways for initial reception and cultivation** are detailed in the previous notes.\n\nThe **Initial Reception of the Upper Clarity Dao** proceeds thus:\n\nThe **Venerable Lord Lao** speaks:\n*\"The Upper Clarity Dao is the supreme, most exalted, most true, and most sacred Dao of the **Great Dao Lord of Inner Jade Talismans and Golden Talismans** within the **Uppermost Clarity**. It governs the **Uppermost Clarity’s Supreme Lords, Ancestral Masters of the Dao, Celestial Emperors, Great Gods, True Officials of the Upper Immortals, High Spirit Generals, Soldiers, and Clerks**—countless billions of hosts—all as **commanders under the Upper Clarity’s scriptures, laws, and talismans**.*\n\nAt the time of **initial reception**, one must **fast and purify oneself for seven days**, solemnly pledging allegiance to **Heaven, Earth, the Sun, Moon, and Starry Hosts**. Upon completion, one must **seek another Daoist** to **report to one’s sponsoring master**, requesting that they **guard one’s body and mind**, **preserve one’s upright resolve**, and **devoutly emulate the Great Dao**, even if it means **traveling ten thousand *li* to seek a teacher**—\n*Note: If the teacher is nearby, one may simply say, ‘I carry my satchel to seek a teacher.’*\n\nOne humbly beseeches the **Venerable Teacher** to **mercifully accept and guide** this disciple, stating:\n‘I now enter beneath the **door of the Venerable Teacher**, to receive the **Upper Clarity Jade Talismans**—thus and so.’\n\nThrough **twenty-four stages** or **thirty-six stages**, one may receive the **favor of transmission**. Should one **betray this oath**, the **Seven Ancestors** will bear witness.\n\nShould one **disrespect the teacher or betray the Dao**, one’s life will be forfeit to the **Three Officials**, with no regret in death.\n\nThis is my **solemn declaration**; I dare not presume further. I bow twice.\n*Note: If permitted, one must then, in the **Transmission Rites**, formally submit these words and follow the teacher’s instructions as broken down. If unable to discern something, one must **bow and request clarification**, stating, ‘This matter is beyond my understanding.’ If the teacher grants it, one must **establish an altar for three days and nights**, declaring to the **Ten Directions**, petitioning the **Supreme Dao Lord, Supreme Venerable Lord Lao, the Emperor of Golden Gate Supreme Peace, the Later Sage Lord of Jade Sovereignty, and the Three Sacred Celestial Sovereigns**—all with **yellow tablets bearing red script**. Only after this **report is received** may one **begin the transmission**, following the prescribed rites.\n\n**Initial Reception** consists of **three**—\n*Note: The Three Elements (Upper, Middle, Lower).*\n**and five**—\n*Note: The Five Stars, Five Spirits, Five Phases, Five Tones, Five Forms, Five Viscera, Five Fingers, Five Heads, Five *qi*s.*\nAs the *Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl Scripture* states:\n‘In Heaven, they are the **Five Stars**; in the Dao, they are the **Five Spirits**; in the numinous, they are the **Five Phases**; in music, they are the **Five Tones**; on Earth, they are the **Five Peaks**; in humans, they are the **Five Viscera**; in the hand, they are the **Five Fingers**; in the law, they are the **Five Heads**; in prohibitive arts, they are the **Five *qi*s**—thus, they are **three times five, fifteen in total**.’\nHuman **life and destiny** belong to these **Five Phases**.\n\nThe **Later Sage Lord** instructed **Emperor Yin’s True Person** on the **oral transmission**:\n‘Those who know to receive the **three and five** each have their **merits**; follow the teacher’s guidance in reception.’\n\nIf the **aspirant depends on the teacher** and the teacher **does not violate the rites**, and if the **transmission of the law and talismans is properly conferred**, then such resolve **will surely attain the Dao**.\nThe Scripture says:\n‘The **Supreme Dao is the teacher**; the **aspirant seeks the Dao**. Having received the **three elements to their utmost**, one endures for **a hundred *kalpas** and lives eternally.’\n\nUpon completion, the **Five Stars reappear**, granting **longevity, immortality, world-transcendence, and ascension**—this is the **Upper Clarity Law**.\n\nIf the **Law resides in another land**, one must **go to that land**.\n*Note: The Scripture says: ‘A **clear teacher and supreme law** may be in distant lands. If one seeks to receive it, one must not **beg the teacher to come**, for even if they do, it is **not the true law**. If there is a **royal command** that one cannot refuse, then one may **properly invite them**. The invitation must not violate the **ritual statutes**.’*\n\nIf the **Law is on the **Sacred Mountain**, one must **go to the Sacred Mountain**.\n*Note: The **Later Sage Lord** told the **Later Sage Grand Marshal**:\n‘Your **rank is noble yet humble**; you cannot attain the Dao. I have prepared your **body** for this. If the Dao is in the **mountains**, you must **depend on the mountain** to receive it. If the Dao is in the **city**, you must **depend on the city** to receive it. If the Dao is with a **lowly, vulgar person**, you must still **follow their instruction** in reception. **Do not disrespect the teacher or belittle the Dao**. Even if your words seem slight, you will **lose your human form** and become a **lower ghost**, never regaining humanity. Even if you are the wife of a **frivolous, lowly man**, yet you possess **virtue and power**, and you **kneel before him as a disciple**, how could you suddenly **mock him with words**, blame yourself, and call him a **foolish youth**, ignorant of a **common, vulgar woman**, yet receive the **three and five** and the **Upper Clarity Law**? Your regret would be profound. Do you not recall these words?’\n\nThe **Grand Marshal** replied:\n‘I **inquired of a foolish, vulgar person** and **laughed at the teacher**, acting with **frivolous disrespect**. Now that I have attained the **position of Upper True Person** and am called **Heaven’s Noble Lady**, I **mocked the utterly foolish and vulgar**, with **no wisdom or recognition**—a **deadly sin**. I humbly pray that the **Celestial Sovereign and Great Dao’s power** take pity, and I **beg to know what rites or offerings** I may make to **atonement**.’\n\nThe **Later Sage Lord** spoke again:\n‘You need only **wear the three-and-five talismans**, **repent on your natal day**, and **apologize for your words**. You must also **repent on *jiazi* days** and within **two years**, you shall **attain the Dao**.’\nThe Grand Marshal **followed these instructions**, and two years later, the **Later Sage Lord** summoned him as the **Grand Marshal of the Southern Palace**, overseeing the **ten heavens’ union for ascension**. **Do not belittle the Dao of the teacher!**\n\nThe **Later Sage Lord** again instructed **Emperor Yin’s True Person**:\n‘Even a **common teacher** has their **principles**; one must **not speak ill of them**. How much more so if the teacher **has Daoic resolve**—one must **never speak ill**, lest one **fail the test**. The **Supreme Lord sees from afar** and will **certainly impose punishment**. The **crime of disrespecting the teacher** causes **disciples to lose their immortality**, demoting them **two ranks**, and the teacher is also **demoted a rank**. **Beware! Beware!**’\n\nThe **Venerable Lord Lao** says:\n‘To **transmit the Great Dao’s law** as a teacher—if one has **not fathomed the Dao’s source**, has **not communicated with spirits or harmonized with Heaven and Earth**, and lacks **meritorious deeds in saving the world**—then one **should not be a teacher**. To **recklessly transmit the Supreme Dao** will cause **future generations to lose the Dao’s lineage**, and the **offense is not light**. Such **heavenly tribunals judge as crimes of leaking secrets**.’\n\nIn the **Yellow Emperor’s era**, there was **South Mountain Lord**—\n*Note: Surname **South**, given name **Mountain Lord**; he hid in the mountains and studied deeply, mastering the **Confucian rites and music**.*\n\nThe **Supreme Daoist Lord** [太上大道君] decreed, *\"You claim to have accumulated virtue and accumulated benevolence, to delve deeply into the Great Dao’s teachings. You dwelled in the mountains for four lifetimes and over ten years, never venturing into the world, yet you claim to have taught a thousand disciples—renowned for their multitude. Suddenly, you are heard to have proclaimed the **Celestial Lord’s** [上帝] command that you instruct the **Venerable Spirit-Person** [仙真人], and you descend to examine **South Mountain Lord** [南山君]. You reproach him: ‘How did you learn the Dao? Who was your teacher? Now you recklessly transmit the Dao’s law to the masses.’\n\n**South Mountain Lord** replied: ‘My teacher was **West Mountain Lord** [西山君].’\n*Note: Surname **West**, given name **Mountain Lord**; now his surname is changed to **White** [白], taking the meaning of \"White West\" [白西], and his name is **West Mountain White** [西山大白].*\n\nThen the **Venerable Spirit-Person** summoned **West Mountain Lord** [西山子] and asked: ‘You presumptuously claim to be **one with the Dao** [有道]. What virtue do you possess toward Heaven? What virtue do you possess toward Earth? What merit have you earned for humanity? Yet you secretly transmit the **Supreme Dao’s** [至道] teachings to **South Mountain Lord** [南山子], and he, in turn, spreads them among the common folk. Many accuse you of leaking celestial secrets, corrupting the **pure and sacred** [真圣], and defiling the **Heavenly Patterns** [天文] with impure *qi* [炁].\n\nMoreover, you yourself have not yet **communicated with spirits** [通灵] or **saved your own life** [济身], nor have you **mastered the Dao’s arts** [炁术] to the point of **transcending sickness and death** [老病垂死]. Yet you suddenly **transmit the Dao to others** [度人].\n\nThe **Supreme Daoist Lord** [太上大道君] commands me to summon you and inquire into your reckless transmission of the Dao. You must swiftly and fully explain its cause. I will report it above, and I will also **open the path of rectification** [开正方便] for you, **reducing your offense and mitigating your guilt** [减罪].\n\n**West Mountain Lord** [西山子] replied to the **Lord**: ‘With sincere resolve, I studied the Dao. For a long time, I hid in the mountains, **cultivating myself** [修行]. Later, I intended to **save the people** [济民]. But **South Mountain Lord** [南山子] relentlessly pressed me with **knee-walking** [膝行], begging to receive the **Dao’s arts** [炁术] and the **Spirit-Symbols of the Five Emperors** [五帝灵符].\n*Note: The **true script** [真文] is the Dao’s arts. The **five symbols** [五符] are the Spirit-Symbols of the Five Emperors.*\n\nThe *Three Sovereigns’ Inner Golden Scriptures* [《三皇内箓金经》],\n*Note: This is the* Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl [《金锁流珠》].\n\nThe Jade Scriptures,\n*Note: These are the Twenty-Four Dao Lords’ Jade Scriptures [二十四道君玉箓].*\nThirty-six volumes in total. Moreover, I formerly received them at the Brink of the Wu Heavenly Clan [吴天氏边], with the mandate to pass them down in succession, forbidding reckless transmission.\n\nI humbly pray that the Celestial Pure [天真] take pity and save Lord West Mountain for his offense of leaking the Heavenly Texts [泄露天书]. I do not dare to presumptuously refuse instruction, nor do I dare to transmit without succession. I humbly accept the crime of receiving stolen transmissions.\n\nThe True Person [真人] said: *\"Unrighteous! You presumptuously transmitted as if receiving the Law [妄传为受法]. You yourself have not yet attained spiritual penetration [通灵], nor have you fulfilled your allotted years. How much have you violated the precepts? There is no name for ‘theft’ here—according to this, you should be demoted from the Dao.\"*\n\n\"Only if you have nurtured the Recommended One, Broad-Chest Lord [广成君], and he guarantees no leakage, will you yourself be free of offense.\"\n\nLord West Mountain bowed twice, acknowledging his death-guilt and offering repeated thanks.\n\nThe True Person ascended to the Heavenly Palace and reported Lord West Mountain’s transgression to the Most High [太上].\n*Note: If this is followed, one must not transmit recklessly—transmission must align with its principles and precepts.*\n\nLater, the Holy Sovereign [圣君] told the Heavenly Master [天师]:\n\"You inherit and transmit the Three-Five True Laws [三五正法], the Upper Clarity True Scriptures [上清真经], and the Inner Scriptures [内箓], encompassing the Three Primordials [三元] and the Five Spirits [五灵].\n*Note: The Five Spirits’ Laws [五灵法] are complete within the Three Primordials, hence called the Five Spirits.*\n\nUpon completion, one receives True *qi*.\n*Note: *Qi* has three grades.\nThe highest grade is the Three Primordials, which refine *qi* into Heavenly Dao Scriptures and Laws [大道文法].\nThe middle grade is the Five Phases [五行], which refine True *qi* into Heavenly Martial Laws [武法].\nThe lowest grade is the Six Jia [六甲], called Spirit-*qi*, which operates between Heaven and Earth and among humans—this is the One Dao, One Martial [一文一武], the power to inhibit and communicate with spirits.\nThus, the initial stage of Daoist practice is the first rank of immortality and divinity.\n\nCommand the later disciples: none should receive the Scriptures and Laws without first following this sequence. Those who complete the cycle receive these three grades of True *qi*, knowing the gates of cultivation and achieving daily spiritual merit.\n\nThe superior adept, upon fulfilling three thousand merits, ascends in broad daylight. This encompasses the Three Primordials, the Five Phases, the Six Jia, and the Seven Stars.\n*Note: The Star-Stepping Method [蹑步] follows the Heavenly and Earthly Laws [天纲地纪法].*\n\nThe Six Laws,\n*Note: The Six Laws are: One Orthodoxy [正一], the Three Primordials [三元], the Five Phases [五行], the Six Jia [六甲], the Seven Stars [七星], and the Eight Trigrams and Nine Palaces [八卦九宫]. Together, they govern Heaven, Earth, and spirits, encompassing all without exception, driving and commanding them.*\n\nUpon completion, they are divided into banners [旌], nodes [节], and inscribed with the Sword Edict [授剑]. When finished, the Master divides the banners, nodes, and name tablets at the Earthly Portal of the Nine Immortal Palace [洞府地户九仙宫之门].\n*Note: The Earthly Portal Nine Immortal Palace is the Bracketed Azure Grotto Heaven [括苍洞天]. Within Bracketed Azure Mountain, the Eastern Orthodoxy is Mount Le-Cheng [东正乐成], the Western connection is Bracketed Prefecture [西连括州], the Southern Orthodoxy is Yongjia [南正永嘉], and the Northern border is Mount Le-An [北接乐安].*\n\nAfter the Master completes the transmission at the gate, he writes out the human-world Scriptures, Laws, and Sacred Texts sufficient for practice. Then, through the Six Jia Laws and the Star-Stepping Method, one cultivates and achieves spiritual merit, fulfilling the merit to ascend in broad daylight.\n\nIf one wishes to descend to the mortal world, or if the Master petitions, one is granted an official position among the True Officials of the World. You must inherit and record this, sealing it into the immortal lineage and registers, reporting it one by one to the Heavenly Bureau [天曹籍].\n\nThus, the Heavenly Master, following the Most High’s words, established twenty-four administrative districts in the West Sichuan Mountains as governance, appointing officials to embody the Earthly Portal Nine Immortal Palace’s intent.\n*Note: The Heavenly Master said: ‘The Eastern and Southern Earthly Portals are distant, so I established the Sichuan Mountains as twenty-four districts.’ Each district was petitioned to register ten thousand ascended immortals to replace the Nine Immortals of the Earthly Portal Palace.*\n\nWhile the Heavenly Master lived, the Earthly Portal Palace’s affairs were managed in Sichuan. After the Heavenly Master ascended, they were moved to the Eastern Orthodoxy Grotto Heaven within Bracketed Azure Mountain.\n\nAll earthly matters are reported to the Heavenly Bureau here, and responses are given. Heavenly Edicts descend accordingly.\n\nThe Venerable Lord [老君] told the Eastern Sea Water-and-Land Immortal Mother:\n*Note: The Water-and-Land Immortal Mother is Peng’s Wife [彭夫人], the eldest daughter of Pengzu.*\nInitially, she married into the Wang clan, but her husband died after ten years. She then married into the Meng clan, but he also died. Thus, she withdrew into seclusion, devoting herself to the Dao.\n\nInitially, she saw an earth snake moving along a winding path. She began practicing its three-step serpentine gait, often imitating it, and took delight in it. After seven years of this, she suddenly saw a woman who said: *\"You are learning the Step of the Halter [步纲].\"* She replied: *\"I was merely playing with irregular movements—this is not the Step of the Halter.\"*\n\nBecause she daily practiced the serpent’s gait, her footsteps gradually became familiar, pleasing to others, though she had no intention of seeking the Dao. Such reckless movement—how could I, with sincere resolve, engage in such deceit? What benefit would it bring to those cultivating the heart?\n\nThe woman said: *\"The serpent’s step is the Dragon’s Halter—it wards off inauspiciousness. I am the middle daughter of the Western Queen Mother [西王母仲女]. Seeing my mother practice the Step of the Halter, I gave you the Earthly Measure Method [蹑地纪之法].\"*\n\nAfter practicing for fourteen years, she ascended to the Eastern Sea, where the Most High sealed her at Fangzhang Mountain, where she resides as the Water-and-Land Immortal Mother. She was ordered to oversee the women of Fangzhang and the seas and lands who seek immortality, teaching them as the Heavenly Messenger of the Dao. She said:\n\n*\"You are of mortal birth, receiving instruction from the Immortal Teacher. Your ascension will be swift. You must teach others, transmitting your resolve to humanity.\"*\n\nThe man said: *\"You are also to perfect the Three Five Dao/Way [三五之法], directly pointing to its essence [元], so that you may attain ascension swiftly [得仙在速]. Do not transmit it to mortals [非人], nor violate it [勿犯之]. Otherwise, you should withdraw yourself [退汝身]. Now, in this age, seven women have all received the Dao/Way [得道] after practicing it.\"*\n\nThe **Most High Sovereign of the Total Perfection [后圣统仙总真王君]** said: *\"From this scroll onward, it is the Dao/Way of the Upper Primordial [上元之法].\"*\n\n**Gold Lock Flowing Pearl Scroll, Section Three [金锁流珠引卷之三]**\n**Gold Lock Flowing Pearl Scroll, Section Four [金锁流珠引卷之四]**\n\nThe **Total Perfection Great Immortal Sovereign of China [中华总真大仙宰王]**, Zhang Daoling [张道陵], Zhao Sheng [赵升], Wang Chang [王长], Li Zhongfu [李仲甫], Mao Ying [茅盈], Xu Yu Fu [许玉斧], and others, were later generations who compiled this text.\n\n**Li Chunfeng [李淳风]**, the Daoist Sage of China, annotated it.\n\n**Five Ranks Ritual Master [五等礼师] Instructions:**\n\n1. **First, the Ritual Master of Petitions and Offerings [奏章拜表礼师]**\n   The *Record of the Heavenly Master’s Former Rituals and Petitions [天师旧仪关奏典录]* states:\n   *\"The Heavenly Master’s primary duty is to receive the **Orthodox One [正一]** Teacher and perfect all functions. The **Rectification of Qi [治炁]** must be clear and distinct.\"*\n\n   **Annotation:** What is meant by *clear and distinct* [分明]?\n   The Heavenly Master has **twenty-four stages of rectification [二十四治]**, each corresponding to a **Rectified Official of Qi [正治官]** and **Rectified Qi [正炁]**. The total of these twenty-four rectifications [二十四生炁] is sufficient for one to be called a **First Rank Rectification Master [正一度师]**.\n\n   *\"After three bows [三拜], I pray that the Teacher may descend the twenty-four **Qi Rectifications [生炁]** into my body. Then, I shall emerge as an Official [出官], as requested in the petition. The Officials shall all emerge, and the one who emerges shall be solemnly arrayed, fully guarding my gate. This is to open and allow the petition to reach the Most High [达上言].\"*\n\n   This is called the **First Rank Rectification Master [正一度师]**.\n\n   *\"I pray to lead the twenty-four Qi Rectifications [二十四治], and the twenty-four **Qi Rectifications within Rectification [治中二十四生炁]**, descending and entering into my body.\"*\n\n   *\"I also pray to lead the **Officials of Rectification [治中吏兵功曹使者]**, all descending into my body. Three bows [礼三拜].\"*\n\n   **Annotation:** If the Rectification Master [治师] is also granted the **Orthodox One Scripture [正一箓]**, then only this one Teacher need be invoked [存], without the need for separate invocation.\n\n   *\"After the invocation, follow the petition’s ritual instructions [拜章表诀], and then offer incense. This is the complete method [具足法].\"*\n\n   The **Later Sage Sovereign [后圣君]** told the Heavenly Master:\n   *\"If you wish to petition and offer obeisance, first declare: ‘The **Upper Primordial Rectification of the Orthodox One [太玄都正一平炁]**, is the **Primordial Rectification of the Most High [上阳平治]**, the **Left Rectification of the Primordial [左平炁]**.’*\n   *\"The Dao/Way you transmit to me and my disciples, when a disciple petitions, shall be declared as: ‘The Heavenly Master’s **Primordial Rectification of the Most High [天师阳平治]**, the **Left Rectification of the Primordial [左平炁]**.’\"*\n\n   Then, invoke the **Rectification Master [治师]** as the **Supreme Teacher [尊师]**, wearing the **crimson robe [紫衣]**, the **peony flower crown [芙蓉花冠]**, and following the ritual scriptures [如法简刺]. Lead the troops from the **western-northwestern direction [西北]**, and perform three bows [礼三拜]. The **Scripture Master [箓师]** shall then lead the **three generals [三将军]**, the **Officials of Rectification [功曹使者]**, descending as seen. The **Supreme Teacher [尊师]** shall wear the **crimson robe [紫衣]**, the **lotus flower crown [莲花冠]**.\n\n   *\"I pray that the Teacher may lead the **Officials of Rectification [功曹使者吏兵]**, descending into my body. Three bows [礼三拜].\"*\n\n   **Annotation:** If it is the **Rectification Master [治师]**, and he is also granted the **Orthodox One Scripture [正一箓]**, then only this one Teacher need be invoked, without further separate invocation.\n\n   *\"After the invocation, follow the petition’s ritual instructions [拜章表诀], then offer incense. This is the complete method [具足法].\"*\n\n   The **Later Sage Sovereign [后圣君]** told the Heavenly Master:\n   *\"When petitioning and offering obeisance, first declare: ‘The **Upper Primordial Rectification of the Orthodox One [太玄都正一平炁]**, is the **Primordial Rectification of the Most High [上阳平治]**, the **Left Rectification of the Primordial [左平炁]**.’*\n   *\"The Dao/Way you transmit to me and my disciples, when a disciple petitions, shall be declared as: ‘The Heavenly Master’s **Primordial Rectification of the Most High [天师阳平治]**, the **Left Rectification of the Primordial [左平炁]**.’\"*\n\n   Then, invoke the **Supreme Teacher [尊师]** as before, and perform the rituals [行法事]. This is effective in this age [系代灵验].\n\n2. **Second, the Ritual Master of the Dragon’s Halter and Earthly Measure [步纲蹑纪礼师]**\n   The *Secret Scripture of the Jade Capital’s Flying Step [玉京飞步秘箓]* states:\n   *\"If one desires to practice the **Earthly Measure [蹑地纪]**, the **Dragon’s Halter [飞天纲]**, and the **various Dao/Way methods of the Halter and Measure [纲禁之法]**, such as the **Yugaitan Step [禹步]**, first invoke the **Great Halter Master [纲头大度师]**.*\n\n   **Annotation:** **Fangzhu’s Treatise on the Halter and Measure [樊夫人作《纲纪论》]** states:\n   *\"The **Iron Head Master [钢头师]** is named the **Great Halter Master [大禁师]**. If one receives this **Flying Step Dao/Way [飞步之法]**, it must be from a Teacher who is **penetrating in spirit [通灵]**, **moving in power [威动]**, and can **inspire awe in heaven and earth, ghosts and gods [感天地鬼神畏敬]**, whose **virtue/power is profound [德行重]**, and whose **practice is unyielding [行用不泄]**. Only such a Teacher may be invoked as the **Great Halter Master [纲头大禁师]**.*\n\n   *\"This Teacher shall receive the Dao/Way, and the disciple shall later practice and invoke this Teacher in meditation [修行思存此师]. Within a year, the disciple shall often dream of receiving instruction in the Dao/Way. Within two years, the disciple shall be **penetrating in spirit [通神灵]**, **moving in power [威动]**, and able to **command heaven and earth, and drive the spirits of the ancestral halls and temples [驱使社庙]**, all as desired. The words shall flow smoothly and naturally [依口顺言].\"*\n\nMistress’ Teacher, **Lu Wénqiáng**, received the *Golden Lock Flowing Pearl Sutra* in fifteen volumes, the **orthodox talismans of the Pure and Precious Three Hundred and Sixty Stages**, and the diagrams of **Earth’s Measure and Heaven’s Halter**.\n\nLater, through practice not exceeding two years, she felt the response of spirits and the movement of heaven and earth, knowing that all her wishes were granted and her requests fulfilled abundantly.\n\n**Li Huìjǔ’s Note:** Now, simply call upon the Teacher’s name softly.\n\nWhen the Teacher arrives, riding upon **nine-colored flying clouds**, clad in **purple robes and crown**, bearing a sword, descending from heaven, she shall be greeted with **three bows**. *(Note: Either in heart or in truth.)*\n\nAfterward, may the Teacher attain immortality, ascending to the **Supreme Pure and True Person**.\n\nThe disciple—*(Note: Zé Xuán)*—shall also attain immortality, succeeding generation after generation without end, free from calamity, forever banished from sickness and misfortune, entering **Eternal Life**, with household stability and no external harm. Dare I betray the Teacher’s grace? I humbly beseech divine protection.\n\nThen, **twirl the Three Teachers’ Incantation**. *(Note: On the left hand’s fourth finger, first joint, facing left.)*\n\nAfter performing the rites on the **five-colored silk**, having completed the incantation—*(Note: The scripture says: After binding with the five-colored silk, one must then twirl the silk again before reciting the spell.)*—then proceed with the ritual.\n\nThis spell is the **Secret of the Later Sage Emperor**, not to be passed to the world. **One character is worth ten thousand gold**—do not transmit it.\n\nRecite the **Later Sage Emperor’s Incantation Given to Chi Sōngzi**. *(Note: Command that not a single character be carelessly transmitted; keep it secret.)*\n\nThe **Taiping** title now emerges in this age, as heaven and earth transmit it through the **Great Teacher**. **Yuánshǐ** first obtained it, heaven and earth forming it together. **Yuánshǐ** transmitted it, the **Dao Lord** knowing it first, hence the title **Supreme Venerable Lord**.\n\nPreserved across generations, **Pángǔ the Heavenly Emperor** received it. The **Human Emperor** and **Earth Emperor** successively taught one another, giving rise to the **Five Emperors**, the **Six Jia** and **Ten Heavenly Stems**, the **Twelve Earthly Branches**, the sun, moon, and stars, the **Rotating Sphere and Seven Governors**, all harmoniously transmitted. **Xī** and **Shénnóng**, the **Yellow Emperor**, and their descendants all inherited it properly. *(Note: Wùyóu’s son hid it; it was not transmitted for five thousand years.)*\n\nIn the **Yáo** dynasty, it was passed to the **Western Barbarians**, who became kings and teachers, flourishing for **one thousand five hundred years**. After one thousand five hundred years, the **Dao** again prospered.\n\nIts influence spread westward. *(Note: The Western influence transformed the Barbarian King into the Buddha.)* After **one thousand five hundred years**, *(Note: When the time was fulfilled, it returned to China.)* it properly reunited.\n\nThe **Golden Gate Later Sage Emperors** succeeded as Teachers, instructing their ministers to chant the incantation and recite it silently. *(Note: Thereafter, the Later Sage Emperor instructed Yín Zhēnren as the Teacher, passing it down.)*\n\nThe **True Incantation** is as follows: *(Note: This incantation was structured by the Yuánshǐ Heavenly Venerable to gather the qi of all heavens as a true spoken spell, transmitted by Teachers generation after generation before performing the Halter. There is verification for this.)*\n\n**Three Heavens Departed, Azure Heaven Divine, Crimson Heaven Radiant, Seven Heavens Net, Wú Heaven Bright, Azure Heaven Named, Eight Heavens Resplendent, Imperial Heaven Pearl, Yǔyú Heaven Devouring, Nine Heavens Pressed, Dragon Heaven Revived, King Heaven Mysterious.**\n\nAbove are **fifteen phrases**, declaring my **eighty-one gates**. The **Red Mother Water Gate** is acceptable. *(Note: The above is the Later Sage Emperor’s transmission to the Twenty-Eight True Persons of Xuánzhōu, who chanted together and stored the Teacher in thought. Within seven years, the twenty-eight ascended together to Xuánzhōu as True Persons. This is the inner taboo of yin-yang and the Five Phases, and also the hidden name of the True Consort within the Northern Dipper. The Later Sage Emperor treasured this as an extraordinary secret—do not dare to casually transmit it.)*\n\nThe **eleven characters** are recorded at the end of the second volume of the *Golden Lock Flowing Pearl*.\n\nIf people see it but do not know how to apply it, one must use this passage to explain it before understanding.\n\nThere are also **two characters of the True Person’s name within the Northern Dipper**. Call upon it, and the Teacher will appear before you. In **three steps**, speak softly, invoking the Teacher’s compassionate step of the Halter, requesting instruction. May the Teacher teach me to **walk the Earth’s Measure**, **fly into Heaven’s Halter**, seeking life and attaining it, seeking nobility and attaining it, seeking healing and recovering, all wishes fulfilled, all desires granted. Through Dao practice, I attain immortality, my household receiving blessings, both inner and outer touched by grace. The disciple dares not betray the Teacher’s kindness. **Two bows**, then **close the qi for three breaths**, chanting the **True Person’s name within the Dipper**, and proceed with the rites.\n\nThe **True Person’s name within the Dipper** is **Gē**. The **Lord’s name** is **Jiān**. Call upon them **three times**, twirl the **Northern Dipper Incantation**, and then step the Halter.\n\n**Thirdly, the Examination and Summoning Ritual for the Platform and Teacher’s Rites**, as in the *Pure and Precious Examination and Summoning Rites*:\n\nThe **Examination and Summoning Ritual** is to examine ghosts and summon gods. The matter is great, not small—**purity and clarity** are required. Establish the platform, set up the registers, build the prison, and open the gate. Tie the rope around the platform and prison; the platform has **four gates**, with **forbidden steps and boundary seals**. Place the **green incense case and clear lamp**; at night, during the **first watch’s third hour**, it is acceptable.\n\nSeal the boundary, restrain the water, and prohibit the platform. **Reside in the heart with Yǔ’s Step**, encircle the outside in a **Ding-character formation**, and sprinkle water within the platform.\n\nThen, stand facing west, invoking the **Three Pure Ones’ Examination and Summoning Pure and Precious Master, Lord Li**, clad in **floating purple robes**, crowned with sword, riding **flying purple clouds**, all arriving from the **west-north**, circling the platform **three times**.\n\nThen, the Teacher shall **seal the platform with me**, leading the **Yang Soldiers** to the **Heavenly Tribunals and Human Intervals**, together with the **talisman soldiers within my body**, united in heart and strength, for the sake of **this household’s**—whether to **capture malevolent ghosts** or **fulfill a certain matter**.\n\nAgain, **Lord Zhōu** leads the **Yin Soldiers**, assisting within **this body**, entering the **underworld and waters**, or the **tomb of this household**, seizing the **ghost bandits harming this household**, bringing them to the platform for interrogation. The cause shall be examined, and the case reported. *(Note: Alternatively, use this text to report the case.)*\n\n「Pursue and capture. The disciple shall perform the rites according to the **Heavenly Tribulations** (*Tiānkēo*), following the **Orthodox Dao/Way of the One** (*Zhēngyī Zhīfǎ*), and pray for the **Yang Master** and **Yin Master** to be granted.\n\n*Note: If the Yang Master is unavailable, the disciple shall instead visualize the Master’s presence within oneself, substituting for the Master’s own body.*\n\nUpon completion, the disciple shall **twirl the Heavenly Master’s incantation** (*tiàomù*), **concentrate the Heavenly Master’s descending true qi** (*jiàng zhēn qì*), and **infuse it into one’s own body**. Then, the disciple shall **assist the body’s talisman soldiers** (*fǔ qì*) in deploying **water, fire, and lion forces** (*fàng shuǐ fàng huǒ fàng shīzi*), dispatching the **Three Elements and Nine Heavenly Generals** (*Sānyuán Jiǔtiān Jiāngjūn*), uniting in heart and strength to **shatter the malevolent ghosts** (*zhēngyāo*) encamped in **certain mountains, temples, or bandit strongholds**, as well as **the household’s rogue spirits** (*fǒuhuài yǐn*). All shall be **reduced to dust and rubble** (*shā bēng wà suì*), **consumed by flames** (*huǒ shāo*), or **swept away by water** (*shuǐ dàng*). The **vital spirits** (*jīngyāo*) shall be **beheaded at the waist**, and the household’s afflictions—whether **disease or misfortune**—shall be **alleviated and resolved**.\n\n*Note: The following words may be added as needed, and the invocation may be adjusted accordingly.*\n\n**Proceed to the summoning ritual.**\n*Note: The summoning ritual requires contemplating the Master’s presence before one’s body.*\n\nThe **Three Elements and Nine Heavenly Generals** shall be led, along with the **Five Virtue/Power Generals** (*Wǔdé Jiāngjūn*)—five in number—and **a hundred thousand soldiers**, arrayed to encircle the target’s dwelling. If the disciple performs this alone, they shall **fortify their own household’s gates and doors**, stationing **sixteen guards at each door** (*chāi yī shíliù rén bǎ yī mén bā rén liè mén yībiān*), with blades facing downward, and **one guard per door** (*yīyī lìzhù dāo*), as if in military formation, deploying **soldiers and officers** (*fǔ liè xíngzhèn*) to **seize the encampment’s gates**, resembling the **austerity of a tribunal**.\n\nUpon completion, the Master shall appear, riding upon **nine-colored clouds** (*jiǔsè yún*) or a **lion**, arriving from the **east**. The disciple shall lead the soldiers to **patrol the target’s doors and gates above and below**, **establishing protective barriers** (*jiéjiè*), **sealing with prohibitions** (*jìnzhòu*), and **pursuing with talismans and writs** (*zhuīdié*), ensuring all rites are properly observed.\n\nThe Master shall **emanate radiant light from the void** (*fàng chū guāngmíng*), **summoning soldiers** (*yǒng chū bīngshì*) to **encircle the seas and block the earth**, **inspecting the Heavenly Prisons of the Nine Heavens** (*rào tiān jiǎn yù*), and **extract the three souls and seven spirits** (*sān hún qī pò*) of **certain relatives or individuals** (*mǒu qīn biǎo mǒu rén*). If the target is a woman, it is **fourteen spirits** (*shísì pò*). The **three souls** (*sān hún*) shall be **separated from the ghost** (*dé lí yāo*), and within the courtyard, they shall **attach to the disciple’s own body**, thereby **curing the disease instantly**.\n\n**Twirl the Three Masters’ incantations** (*niǎn sān shī tiàomù*).\n*Note: The incantations are located on the left hand’s fifth finger—first is the Master’s incantation, second is the Orthodox Dao/Way Master’s incantation, and third is the Heavenly Master’s incantation. The Orthodox Dao/Way Master’s incantation for summoning the Heavenly Master’s disciples to assist is as follows:*\nThe **Later Sage** (*Hòushèngjūn*) instructs the Heavenly Master: *\"If one visualizes the Master’s presence as a substitute, and the Master understands this method, it shall be effective. If the Master does not understand this method but only knows the transmitted rituals of succession and talisman-writing, then visualization shall not be used. Otherwise, the rites shall fail, the prohibitions shall not subdue, and retribution shall ensue. Do not presume to act—beware, beware!\"*\n\n**Visualize the Master’s soldiers emerging**, each as prescribed by the method. **Refer to previous annotations.**\n\nNext, **contemplate the Twenty-Eight Constellations** (*Érshíbā Xiù*), arraying them upon one’s body. Then, **invoke the Nine Heavenly Generals and their officers and soldiers** (*Jiǔ Jiāngjūn Lì bīngshì*), ensuring the **Three Elements are fully prepared** (*Sānyuán bèijù*), as detailed in the **Comprehensive Diagram** (*Hán tú*).\n*Note: The diagram contains the full complement of the Three Elements’ soldiers and generals.*\n\n**Twirl the Three Elements’ Generals’ incantations** (*niǎn Sānyuán Jiāngjūn tiàomù*).\n*Note: The incantations are located on the left hand’s thumb—first is the heart of the first node.*\n\nUpon completion, the disciple shall **face the ritual seat** (*xiàng àn biān zuòyí*), recite the scripture, and **summon the spirits and ghosts** (*chào shén yāo guǐ shàng*). The disciple shall **interrogate the perpetrators of the affliction**, recording their names and **sentencing them to imprisonment**. Later, the disciple shall submit a **red petition** (*chì zhāng*), requesting the **Heavenly Soldiers** (*Tiān bīng*) to **execute and behead the malevolent spirits**, so that the **disease may swiftly heal** or **certain matters may swiftly resolve**.\n\n**Offer gratitude and conclude the rites.**\n*Note: There are invocations within the soldier-deployment rites; these are not repeated here.*\n\nThe **Later Sage** further instructs the Heavenly Master: *\"These six methods of summoning and interrogation are universal among mortals. The first is to **cure demonic afflictions** (*yízhòu*) and **diseases**, **seize and subdue malevolent spirits and ghosts** (*zhūdié zhēngyāo*), and **execute them**. The second is to **investigate the Heavenly Tribulations and Underworld** (*kān Tiānkēo Dìfǔ*), determining **one’s lifespan, fortune, and social standing** (*niánmìng chángduǎn, pínfù guìjiàn*). The third is to **prohibit and sever public and private grievances and mutual harm** (*gōngsī yuān duì xiāng hài*). The fourth is to **resolve conflicts between spouses or lovers** (*nánnǚ shēngmìng xiāng kè*), ensuring they **do not harm each other**, and **permanently harmonize**, escaping **metal and wood calamities** (*jīn mù zhī zāi*), **water and fire disasters** (*shuǐ huǒ zhī hài*), and **obstacles of disobedience**. The fifth is to **dispel public and private curses and hexes** (*zāi zhòu*), **vengeful ghosts**, and **harm from spirits**, whether from the living or the dead, as well as **plotted slander and verbal assaults** (*túmóu kǒushé zhī hài*), all of which shall be **consumed**, leaving no trace of harm between parties. The sixth is to **mitigate celestial and terrestrial disasters** (*Tiāndì zāihài*), such as **untimely winds and rains** (*fēngyǔ bùshí*), **imbalanced Four Qi** (*sì qì bùzhèng*), **venomous dragons and malevolent ghosts** (*dúlóng zhēngyāo*), **excessive floods or droughts** (*yínshuǐ yínhàn*), and **epidemic and toxic spirits** (*wēndú guǐ qì*). If not performed by a **Properly Orthodox Dao/Way Practitioner** (*Zhèngtiān xíngzhě*), this method shall **remove them as well**.*\n\nThe **Later Sage** further declares to the Heavenly Master: *\"These six categories of summoning and interrogation are the **Supreme Dao/Way Lord** (*Tàishàng Dàdào Jūn*), who **refined and cultivated the true and authentic qi of Heaven and Earth** (*jié xí Tiāndì zhēnzhèng qì*), establishing the **talisman, writ, and scripture rites** (*fújié jīngfǎ*). There are **three thousand eight hundred and one stages** (*yī qiān sānbǎi bāshí yī jiē*) within the **Three Elements’ Orthodox Talismans** (*Sānyuán Zhèngjié*), sufficient to **qualify as a Grand Summoning Master** (*Kǎochāo Dàfǎshī*). This shall **open the Martial and Civil Divisions** (*kāi Wǔnǚ Bù*), appointing **left and right inspecting officers** (*tuīxún guān*), **judicial officers** (*pàn guān*), and **assistant summoning masters** (*fù Kǎochāo Fǎshī*). Such is the **Great Dao/Way**, the **wondrous method of salvation for humankind and benefit for all things** (*miào shàng jiùrén jì wù zhī dàfǎ*). Those who **receive and practice it faithfully** (*néng shòu néng xíng, bù qī bù wàng*) shall **ascend to the Highest Truth** (*lì qǔ shàngzhēn*).\n\nThis method’s merit is **three thousandfold** (*gōng mǎn sāniàn*), enabling **daytime ascension from the household** (*báizhōu shàngshēng*), where **all family members and livestock** shall **together attain Heaven**.\n\n*Note: The merit of three thousand is divided into two categories—this reflects the distinction between the Martial and Civil Divisions. The first category, the **Civil Rites** (*Wénfǎ*), involves studying the **Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl** (*Jīnsuǒ Liúzhū*), **walking the Earth’s Measure** (*Niè dì jì*), **soaring the Heavenly Ropes** (*Fēi Tiān gāng*), **dispersing the Steps of Yu** (*Sàn yǔ bù*), **twirling the True Incantations** (*niǎn zhēn tiàomù*), and **performing these rites year-round without cessation**. One shall **cultivate hidden virtue** (*yīn dé*), **renounce sensory pleasures** (*chú shēngsè*), **avoid idle speech** (*kǒu bù wàng xuān*), and **refrain from spreading falsehoods** (*xīn bù wàng chuán*). Internally, one shall **refine hidden virtue** (*nèi xiū yīn dé*).\n\nOne shall **wear the Six Hexagram Talismans and Scriptures** (*Fú liù jiǎ fúwén*), **don the Five Talismans** (*dài wǔ fú*), and **walk the Five Phases’ Steps** (*bù wǔ xíng*), whether **authentic or counterfeit** (*zhēn wěi*). One shall **remain silent, concealed, and speak little**, **not be misled by others**, and **ensure that grand earthen structures and resounding bells and drums** (*guǎng zào tǔmù gōngdiàn, shēng zá zhōnggǔ*) are constructed—thus, **this method shall eliminate such disturbances**. One shall **solely guard the heart and refine inner cultivation**, **follow the scriptures’ steps and measures**, **wear the talismans**, and **visualize the true and wondrous rites** (*cún zhèng zhēn miào fǎ*). After **twenty-seven years**, the **Supreme Dao/Way Lord**, the **Former Sage, the Hollow Emperor** (*Qūhuáng*), and the **Golden Threshold Emperor of the Great Peace** (*Tàipíng Jīn què Dì*), along with the **Later Sage, the Jade Emperor** (*Xuānyuán Yùhuáng Shàngdàojūn*), shall **dispatch emissaries to welcome** the disciple, enabling **daytime ascension to Heaven**. The **Martial Immortals** (*Wénxiān Zhēn guān*) shall recognize them as **Civil Rites Masters** (*Wénlǐ Fǎshī).*」\n\n「The First Rank of Martial Dao/Way, first taught by the Venerable Lord Lao, involves summoning the Six Grades to examine and rescue sentient beings from illness. When one’s merit reaches three thousand, and the lives saved number three hundred thousand, those who attain enlightenment through healing and those who benefit from their deeds shall be granted joy and nourishment for three thousand souls—this is called *Function of the Multitude*. When the total reaches three thousand, one ascends to Heaven in broad daylight.\n\nThis First Rank of Civil Dao/Way allows only solitary ascension, without transporting one’s residence to Heaven.\n\nIf one practices both Civil and Martial Dao/Way, their entire household—including fowl and dogs—shall ascend together, attaining the rank of Heavenly Sage-King.\n\n**Fourth:** Practice the *Restraint of Qi* for all things between Heaven and Earth. Master Hu Gong’s *Restraint of Qi* scripture states:\nThe *Restraint of Heaven Master* is Li Bo Yang—*note: also the appellation of the Venerable Lord*.\nThe *Restraint of Earth Master* is Luo Wenqiang.\nThe *Restraint of the Halter Master* is Hu Xuanzang—these three are the primary leaders of the *Restraint Halter* traditions.\nThose learning *Restraint* must first visualize these three descending from the void, their cloud-canopied radiance converging at the nape, clad in purple robes amid nine clouds.\nWith the left hand, pinch the *Supreme Restraint*—visualizing them within three steps—then bow three times in reverence.\nIf the *qi* enters, perform nine bows to each of the three masters, three bows per figure.\nWhen complete, follow the original formula to restrain a specific matter or thing—this is highly efficacious.\n*Note: Each formula is pinched according to its respective restraint.*\nThe *Restraint of Qi Three Masters’ Formula* is located on the left hand’s fourth finger at the first joint, and also on the fifth finger’s first joint.\nAfter pinching the formula, take three *Yu Steps*, then chant the restraint incantation.\n*Note: The incantation varies according to the specific restraint.*\nThe Later Sage-King told the Heavenly Master:\n*\"To restrain all things between Heaven and Earth, the master’s name must differ accordingly.\"*\n*Note: This implies succession.*\nThe *Restraint of Heaven Master* is Zhao Boqin.\nThe *Restraint of Earth Master* is Yin Fuzhi.\nThe *Restraint of Ghost Master* is Huang Tiansheng.\nThe *Restraint of Human Master* is Zhang Tuling.\nThese are newly supplemented, yet must be visualized alongside the previous masters, bowing in reverence before performing any of the hundred restraints—all shall succeed divinely.\nThe Heavenly Master’s lineage must be succeeded; why limit reverence to only the previous masters? Three bows suffice.\n\n**Fifth:** Entering armies, mountains, or waters, or traveling to foreign lands where fear of harm or loss of life is imminent—urgent methods to invoke the master’s salvation.\n*Note: This protects oneself and one’s household; do not transmit recklessly, lest it harm the master.*\nThe Yellow Emperor obtained the *Play of the Mysterious Woman’s Urgent Military Strategies* (*Xuánnǚ Bīngjī Jíyào Lù*), saying:\n*\"Those who follow the army without injury—my maiden has the Nine-Heaven Concealment Method. You may pass it to your successors for urgent use. When needed, visualize me as your master, leading soldiers to guard above the Nine Heavens, departing the Nine Calamities, and vanishing unseen, with ten thousand cavalry unable to pursue.\"*\n*Note: From this martial method’s formation, there are formations of the Nine Heavens Above, the Nine Calamities Within, the Nine Earths Below, the Void and Space Within, the Eight Arrays Inside and Outside, the Five Phases Within and the Five Weapons Without—sufficient to calculate the Nine Heavens Above.*\nVisualize the *Original Two-Formation Master*, the *Twelve-Formation Master*, and the *Thirty-Six-Formation Master* within the Nine Calamities, deploying a hundred-thousand-strong army within the Nine Diagrams and Eight Arrays, thus vanishing unseen.\nThis method is profound and difficult to grasp; even a master must demonstrate it face-to-face, lest one fail to execute it properly.\nThe Emperor received it, and indeed encountered fifty-nine battles, defeating Chiyou seven times.\nThe Emperor visualized the Original Master, Xuannü, and transformed the *Thunder Lord Taiyi’s Liu Ren* formations, shielding himself as he emerged—no army could perceive him.\nWhen seen, the Emperor’s form rose above the Nine Heavens.\n*Note: The Nine Heavens Above have their own formation scriptures, fully recorded hereafter.*\nThis wards off calamities.\nThus, even those who merely cultivate the Dao, though not leading armies, may wield Dao-power. Should Heaven’s favor descend, one might suddenly receive celestial talismans, forming a hundred-thousand-strong array to save a million souls—urgently responding to the command.\nFirst, visualize the *Formation Master* clad in crimson robes, holding a scepter and formation, descending through the sky to guard the disciple, emerging above the Nine Heavens.\nPray for the master’s descent, leading generals and soldiers.\n*Note: Among the generals—both Upper and Lower Elements—there are six generals. Within the formations, six generals command troops; visualize each leading fifty thousand soldiers, encircling the body three times, then circling again three times, vanishing above the Nine Heavens. Swiftly, as the law decrees.*\nFor a hundred thousand, a million, or ten million troops.\nLet Li [your surname] and the disciple serve as the Grand General, with the master as the Deputy General.\nNext, visualize the *Chief Halter Restraint Master*—*note: the master of the Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl*—Li Hui, descending on clouds, riding a five-colored lion, clutching the Heavenly Formation in purple robes, stopping three steps ahead, then bow three times in reverence.\nThen bow three times to the *Formation Master* who protects the Grand General.\nAfterward, pinch the *Three Masters’ Formation Formula*.\n*Note: The formula is on the right side of the left hand’s fifth finger’s first joint.*\nRetrieve the formation talisman from the chest, don it on the head, then charge through enemy lines on horseback, entering and exiting battle unharmed.\n\n**Five Talismans:**\n1. *Talisman for Unharmed Entry into Battle*\n2. *Talisman for the Enemy’s General Feeling Awe and Respect, Preventing Harm*\n3. *Talisman for Overcoming Difficult Battles*\n4. *Talisman for Commanding Strong Enemies*\n5. *Talisman for Strengthening the Army’s Morale and Combat Power, Fulfilling All Desires*\n\n**Heavenly Art: First Talisman for Unharmed Entry into Battle**\n*Within this scroll, the talisman is inscribed in vermilion.*\n*Usage:* Write the enemy general’s name beneath the talisman, then seal it with the *Great Void* and lunar stem-branch. The Heavenly Emperor’s seal shall be affixed.\n\n**Heavenly Art: Second Talisman for the Enemy’s General Feeling Awe and Respect, Preventing Harm**\n*Within this scroll, the talisman is inscribed in vermilion.*\n*Usage:* Right Heavenly Art—enter battle to protect the general, causing his troops to feel awe and respect.\n\n**Heavenly Art: Third Talisman for Overcoming Difficult Battles**\n*Within this scroll, the talisman is inscribed in vermilion.*\n*Usage:* Right Heavenly Art—enter battle to overcome difficult enemies.\n\n**Heavenly Art: Fourth Talisman for Commanding Strong Enemies**\n*Within this scroll, the talisman is inscribed in vermilion.*\n*Usage:* Right Heavenly Art—deploy the general to command strong enemies.\n\n**Heavenly Art: Fifth Talisman for Strengthening the Army’s Morale and Combat Power, Fulfilling All Desires**\n*Within this scroll, the talisman is inscribed in vermilion.*\n*Usage:* Right Heavenly Art—order all troops to have steadfast hearts and mighty strength.\n\nThe preceding five talismans are all inscribed by Master Li (師一一书).\nThey shall be transmitted on *Jiazi* days or the recipient’s birthdays to disciples.\nAfter disciples use them in battle, they must remember their original master.\nThen, each talisman shall naturally manifest its power.\nWhen inscribed in vermilion, their effects are profound—like gods appearing and vanishing.\nThey must not be carelessly transmitted.\n\nThe Heavenly Master of West Shu (天師在西蜀) fought against demons and spirits in twenty-eight battles.\nIn every battle, he thought of the **Posterior Sage** (後聖君) leading the way.\nWhen the demons and spirits saw the Posterior Sage, they fled in defeat, turned their weapons, and lay prostrate.\nNone dared resist the enemy.\n\nThe **Celestial Sovereign** (老君) instructed his attendants:\n*\"You who study the Dao must always remember and emulate your master’s methods and techniques.\nThus, you shall quickly attain enlightenment.\"*\n\nThe **Celestial Emperor** (上帝) rejoiced and granted him divine powers, enabling him to transcend the **Three Realms** (出離三界).\nEarth, water, and fire—\nOn the sixth *Jiazi* day and his own birthday, he established the memory of his master,\nAs if seeing him in the void of space atop the five clouds, with winds and immortals accompanying him.\n\n**Three Elements** (三元):\n*Note:* The **Three Element Generals** (三元将军) consist of nine, each commanding officials, soldiers, and countless legions.\n\n**Five Virtues** (五德):\n*Note:* The **Five Virtue Generals**—Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Tortoise, and Yellow Court—each one leading soldiers in the tens of millions according to their respective directions.\nAll are summoned by the master.\n\nEastern direction: 810,000 soldiers;\nWestern direction: 360,000 soldiers;\nSouthern direction: 640,000 soldiers;\nNorthern direction: 250,000 soldiers;\nCentral direction: 120,000 soldiers.\n\nThis is the Heavenly Master’s instruction to **King True Person** (王真人).\n\n**Six Records** (六纪):\n*Note:* There are six records, each with soldiers numbering 120,000.\n\n**Pillar-Heaven Generals** (柱天大将军) twelve in number:\n*Note:* Each commands 36,000 soldiers.\n\n**Twenty-Four Generals of the Six Jiazi and Central Branches** (六甲中干支将军):\n*Note:* Each commands 60,000 soldiers, 1,800 officers, 36,000 talisman messengers, 1,400 Jade Boys, and 2,400 Jade Girls.\nAll follow the master and his disciples into battle—unfazed by enemies, unharmed by soldiers.\nDivine officials guard and protect them; all who enter the ranks grow mighty.\n**As the Celestial Sovereign of the Great Void, the Way’s Supreme Lord, commands: Urgent, urgent, like the heavens.**\nThe following generals and officials, numbering in the hundreds of millions and billions, follow Master Li, **Zhou Chong**, and **Su** (虚) in the void.\nThey deploy to rescue disciples, smashing enemy forces like collapsing mountains and splitting earth.\nThey cause the seas to surge and waves to crash—great winds rise, scattering foes.\nAll disciples and troops, hearts bold and strength unyielding, shall remain unbroken and mighty.\nThe enemy must be utterly defeated.\n**Urgent, urgent, as the Supreme Lord commands: So be it.**\n\nThen twist the **Grand Supervisor Talisman** (捻都监诀) and the **Three Master Talismans** (三师诀), and the **Roaming Master’s Three Talismans** (游师三诀).\n*Note:* The Grand Supervisor is at the first joint of the left hand’s first finger.\nThe Roaming Master is at the second joint.\nAfter twisting these three talismans, take the **Yugong Steps** (禹步) three times.\nThen strike the drum to form the battle array.\nObserve the enemy’s movements and engage accordingly—then protection is assured.\nThis is the ultimate method.\n\nThe **Celestial Sovereign** (老君) told the **True Persons of the Ten Directions** (十方真人):\n*Note:* The **True Persons of the Ten Directions**—**Yunna**, **Zheng Ren**, **Shan Sheng**, **Jing Jia**, **Xu Lai Le**, and others—are the titles of ten True Persons.\nIn scriptures, they are called the **Ten Direction Heavenly Sovereigns** (十方天尊).\n\nFrom the time of **Pangu** and the **Three Sovereigns** (三皇) until the present age,\nOnly these ten hold the positions of the **Ten Direction Heavenly Sovereigns** (十方天尊),\nUnchanging, untransferable, stationed across the ten directions.\n\nYou are the masters of the ten directions,\nStationed in the ten-directional world,\nEncouraging virtue and guiding people,\nUpholding the true transmission of Daoist methods.\nYou must not transmit what is unworthy.\nDo not praise false teachings,\nNor alter sacred scriptures and masterly doctrines.\nDo not slander right and wrong—\nSuch people must not be taught or transmitted to.\n\nIf transmitted recklessly, both master and disciple shall be ruined.\nIf such offenders exist, I shall atone with you,\nSo that neither of us bears guilt.\n\nThen the **True Person of the Southwest** (西南方真人), **Shan Sheng** (善胜), spoke:\n*\"Your disciple **Zhen Jingneng** (真净能) is a man of ancient refinement, skilled in speech,\nAnd adept at flattering with his tongue.\nOnce, I saw him receive the **Highest Scripture and Highest Law** (上经上法) from **Lu Zi Zhen** (路子真),\nA master of the **High Scripture and High Law** (上经上法).\nThough he has not yet attained enlightenment, he practices the law rigorously.\nI then transmitted to him the *Scripture of the Golden Talisman and Jade Talisman* (《金箓玉箓上经》),\n*Note:* Also called *Scripture of the Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl* (《金锁流珠上经》),\nThe method of the **Three Element and Five Virtue** (三元五行) **Orthodox Unity** (正一).\nIn ancient times, it was called the *Scripture of the Golden Talisman and Jade Talisman* (《金箓玉箓》),\nWhere **Jin Zhen** (金真) performs the **Flying Steps** (飞步).\nAlong with it, I transmitted over forty volumes.*\n\n*When he first received the scriptures, I commanded him to write them as he went.\nUpon completion, I ordered him to immediately inscribe the master’s name and his own.\nBut **Zhen Jingneng** (净能) secretly conspired—\n*Note:* Ancient people called secret plotting *yin’an* (阴暗), meaning mutual understanding.\nHe substituted for the master’s name and called me **‘Successor Grandfather, King Jing’** (父真王靖),\nClaiming the scriptures were from me, not you.\nSuch a grave offense—how can it be atoned?*\n\n*I humbly pray that the Heavenly Sovereign (天尊) grants me great compassion and mercy,\nSo that my transgression may be pardoned.\"*\n\nThe **Celestial Sovereign** (老君) replied:\n*\"Your offense may still be forgiven,\nBut **Jingneng’s** (净能) guilt is too great—it cannot be overlooked.\nThis is the crime of betraying one’s heart and turning from the Dao,\nOf plotting against the master.\nHis offense surpasses even filial disobedience toward parents—\nThe heavens and earth themselves shall reproach him.\nSoon, he shall meet ruin in both body and family.*\n*Note:* Within ten years, his body and family were destroyed—was this not the heavens’ retribution?\n\nThe Celestial Sovereign spoke further:\n\n*\"My grace is vast—\nTo overlook minor slanders and instead bestow upon you the eternal scriptures of benevolence and teaching,\nTo perpetuate the sacred lineage of the Dao’s voice and doctrine—\nThis alone can redeem your transgression.\n\nMoreover, the **Golden Talisman** and **Jade Talisman** rituals,\nAll unlock the Great Dao of liberation,\nSealing the heart’s inner secrets,\nTreading the path of heaven and earth,\nSubduing the stars and constellations,*\n*Note: Also called \"Clothing of the Celestial.\"*\n*Reversing the heavens, turning the earth’s axis,\nBinding the celestial gates—\nThis is the true and authentic Dao.\n\nYet your offense remains unforgiven by the cosmic laws.\nYou shall also be demoted one rank among the immortals,\nAnd for fifty years, descend as a mortal teacher,\nHealing three thousand souls to atone for your sins.\nLater, this came to pass—\nYou were demoted and became **Master Bian Que**,\nSkilled in healing, curing three thousand patients,\nBefore reclaiming your original rank.\n\nFor those who become teachers,\nAnd for those who revere their teachers,\nOne must be ever vigilant and precise.\n\nThus, this oath is given—\nThe secret of honoring and remembering the teacher,\nSo that disciples may each guard their conduct,\nMindful of their duty to repay.\n\n*Note: When a teacher instructs a disciple,\nNot all inner secrets and profound teachings may be imparted at once.\nOne must first petition the Celestial Bureau,\nAnd only if approved may the transmission proceed.\nThe Celestial Bureau replied:\n‘If proven worthy, you may be entrusted with the recommendation.’\n\nYet even then, transmission must not be hasty.\nThree or five trials must be conducted,\nAnd only if all are passed may the teachings be given.\nOtherwise, if one first grants the scriptures, talismans, and three ranks of initiation,\nAnd yet the disciple’s devotion wavers—\nIf their body and mind remain impure, if they disrespect the Dao-teacher,\nThen the secrets may not be fully revealed.\nOnly two or three volumes of essential Dao-teachings may be passed on gradually,\nTo delight the Celestial Heart.\nThe Supreme Sovereign, from afar, honors the unwavering devotion of teacher and disciple.\n\nLater, the Holy Sovereign instructed **Yin Xi**:\n‘To be a teacher is difficult,\nTo be a disciple is no easy task—\nThe balance of difficulty lies in both.\n*Note: Human hearts vary; many betray and undermine the teacher’s path.\nAgain, if the transmission is false,\nIf talismans are falsified, if the secrets are severed—\nIf the teachings are incomplete, rendering them useless,\nBoth teacher and disciple shall bear the blame.\nThus, transmission must be tested three times.\nOnly if proven worthy may the scriptures, talismans, and three ranks be first granted.\nThen, after three or five years of trial,\nIf their resolve does not falter,\nThe inner talismans may be bestowed,\nGuiding them into the Dao’s gate,\nWhere they may inherit the lineage,\nHonoring the teacher, preserving the path,\nAnd their practices shall bear divine efficacy.\n\nTo cultivate the self, aid the nation, and save the people—\n*Note: Those of Daoist resolve always act with compassion.\nEach who reveres the teacher’s doctrine,\nIf they honor it as they should,\nShall see their lineage endure with sacred efficacy,\nTheir威灵通神 (mystic power and divine response) unbroken,\nTheir devotion ever alive.\nBut if they disregard their fate,\nDefy the Dao-teacher,\nAnd fail to act in emergencies,\nDivine efficacy shall rarely manifest.\nTo subdue ghosts and govern spirits,\nTo uphold the virtues of the worthy and the Dao,\nFollow this path and secret method,\nSo that teacher and disciple may attain immortality.\n\n*Note: The Celestial Sovereign spoke of the teacher’s resolve\nAnd the disciple’s resolve,\nAnd only then may the true talisman secrets be transmitted,\nOnly then may disciples be properly initiated.\nIf the disciple’s resolve is sincere,\nIf they honor the teacher with filial devotion,\nThen their practices shall swiftly bear fruit.\n\nLater, the Holy Sovereign addressed the **Forty-Nine True Persons**—\n*Note: The Forty-Nine True Persons—those who first practiced the True Way—\nIncluded Xu Jia, Shi Cun, Kong Fangwai, Yang Zhen, Li Ziqī, Li Bāibǎi, Liu Gen, Zhang Jiànchéng, Lü Jīngjiān, Zhou Shànghé, Wang Dēng,\nWei Huaxun, and the two female True Ones, Fan Zhenying.\nAlso Li Shàojūn, Li Shàogāng, Wang Zinián, Han Yuánxìn, Zhang Shàozhēn, Shí Fān Gōng, Qin Jiāo, and Huang Tài—\nForty-nine in total, who successively inherited the teacher’s path.\n\nHe said:\n‘For those who properly receive the sacred scriptures,\nThe talismans, and the true secrets of initiation—\nIt depends on their devotion to and remembrance of the teacher.\n\nWhether they walk a hundred steps from home,\nOr two hundred, three hundred—\nNo matter the distance,\nBefore taking their seat in any place,\nThey must first invoke the **Great Precept of the Celestial Master**,\nAs if the Cloud-Dragon and attendant warriors had arrived.\nWith three reverences, they pray:\n*\"May my teacher attain the rank of True Immortal King,\nAnd ascend to the heavens, attaining the highest station.\"*\n\nFor me—\n*Note: Now, immortals no longer address me thus—this is improper.\nHenceforth, they shall address me as ‘Your Servant, [Name],’—this is the proper etiquette.\n\nTo open the **Five Paths**—\n*Note: Later sages spoke of the Three Paths and Eight Difficulties,\nBut Master Zhang [of the Heavenly Masters] revised it to Five Paths and Eight Difficulties,\nAnd this tradition has been followed, though not entirely adopted.\nThe Five Sorrows and Eight Difficulties—\nOnce named in the **Golden Talisman of Immortal Initiation**,\nShall forever grant the body of a True Person,\nBestowing the Dao’s grace and protection.\nHow dare I betray the teacher’s恩德 (virtue/power)?\n\nUpon completion, they shall strike their teeth twenty-four times,\nAnd recite the **Three-Teacher Secret**.\n\nThis method is wondrous—\nAfter one year, a hundred ailments depart,\nA thousand spirits guard them.\nWithin two years, their family and descendants shall live in eternal peace.\nIn three years, they shall command spirits with efficacy,\nAnd heaven and earth shall respond to their heart and words.\nIn four years, they shall become immortals.\nBut if their heart remains upright,\nWithout favoritism or bias,\nWithin five years, they shall forever be immortals.\nAt twenty-one years, they may ascend if they wish,\nOr remain if they choose—\nEven to seek mortal office, they may do so.\n\n**End of Volume Four of the Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl Talisman.**\n\n**Volume Five of the Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl Talisman.**\"\n\n**Volume Five of the Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl Talisman**\n\nThe **Grand Perfect Daoist Sovereign** of China, **Zhang Daoling** of the **Way of the Five Pecks**, **Zhao Sheng**, **Wang Chang**, **Li Zhongfu**, **Mao Ying**, **Xu Yufu**, and others, are successive compilers of this text. **Li Chunfeng**, the Daoist Immortal of China, annotated it. The **Great Mysterious** begins with **Primordial Qi**—here is the **Three Primordial** introduction.\n\n**Annotation on the Great Mysterious:**\nThe **Great Mysterious** belongs to the **Upper Clarity** grade, marking the origin of **Upper Clarity** and the inception of **Primordial Qi**.\n\n**Primordial Qi** generates the **Great Dao/Way**,\nThe **Great Dao/Way** generates **Taiyi**,\nAnd **Taiyi** generates the **three colors of Qi**—\n**Mysterious Yellow**, **Primordial White**, and **Initial Green**.\n\nThese three colors of **Qi** intermingle in a smoky haze,\nExchanging and returning in cycles—\n**Yellow** produces **Red**,\n**Green** produces **Qi**,\nThus forming the **five colors of Qi**.\n\n**Qi** generates **color**, and **color** generates **Qi**,\nThe three and five in endless interplay—\n**Qi** and **color** coalesce into **form**, and this is called **spirit**.\n\n**Spirit** and **form** have names,\nMarking their stations and clarifying their ranks—\nThey aid each other in transforming malevolence,\nGuard the upright and preserve life,\nSeeking immortality and renown.\n\nWith **incantations** and **seals**, they assist the realm and defend the family,\nDissolving guilt and bestowing blessings,\nProtecting the virtuous and exterminating the wicked—\nAll may become generals, officers, or soldiers.\n\nDifferent ages, different laws—\nIn times of simplicity, some may follow the **rituals of submission and humility**.\nIn eras of excess, others may prefer the **condensed essentials of practice**.\n\nThus, the **Dao/Way** adapts—\nRestraining or expanding, concealing or revealing—\nLater disciples who achieve perfection,\nAssuming the **Mysterious Mandate** of their station,\nResiding by name in their native villages,\nEmerging in each generation—\nSome may lack nothing, but today we record only what the **Master of the Way** transmitted as follows:\n\nThe **Later Sage** and **Divine Sovereign** instructed **Zhang Daoling**:\n*\"If you wish to cultivate and practice,\nFirst know the **origin of life and death**.*\n\n*The **origin of life and death** determines **calamity and blessing**,\nEstablishing clear distinctions—\nThose who gain blessings flourish as **kings**,\nThose who lose blessings decline.\nAnd those who incur **calamity** perish,\nWhile those who avoid **calamity** survive.\nTo eliminate **punishment and calamity**,\nOne must discern the **origin of life and death**.*\n\n*For instance, a person born under the **Jiazi cycle** with a **Golden Command**—\nTheir **Primordial Qi** rests in **Chen**,\nAnd **Chen** belongs to the **Xun direction**, encompassing all.\nThe **origin of life and death** is in **Si**,\nWhich matures into **Wu**, thrives in **Shen**,\nAnd reaches its peak in **You**—\n**You** is the **hour of the king and minister**,\n**You** embodies **blessing and virtue**,\n**Wei** is the **hour of rest**,\n**Hai** is the **hour of decline**,\n**Zi** is the **hour of punishment**,\nAnd **fire** is the **hour of calamity**.\nThis is the **Wuyu Star**.*\n\n*A person born under the **Wood Command**—\nTheir **origin of life and death** is in **Hai**,\nWhich matures into **Zi** and **Chou**,\nThrives in **Yin**,\nAnd reaches its peak in **Mao**—\n**Mao** is the **hour of the king and minister**,\n**Mao** embodies **blessing and virtue**,\n**Chen** is the **hour of rest**,\n**Si** is the **hour of decline**,\n**Wu** is the **hour of punishment**,\nAnd **metal** is the **hour of calamity**.\nThis is the **Jinyuan Star**.*\n\n*A person born under the **Shen Command** with a **Water Command**—\nTheir **origin of life and death** is in **Shen**,\nWhich matures into **You** and **Xu**,\nThrives in **Hai**,\nAnd reaches its peak in **Zi**—\n**Zi** embodies **blessing and virtue**,\n**Chou** is the **hour of rest**,\n**Yin** is the **hour of decline**,\n**Mao** is the **hour of punishment**,\nAnd **earth** is the **hour of calamity**.\nThis is the **Shuiyuan Star**—\nAnd similarly, those born under the **Earth Command** share the **Water Command**’s pattern.*\n\n*For those born under the **Fire Command**—\nTheir **origin of life and death** is in **Yin**,\nWhich matures into **Mao** and **Chen**,\nThrives in **Si**,\nAnd reaches its peak in **Wu**—\n**Wu** embodies **blessing and virtue**,\n**Wei** is the **hour of rest**,\n**Shen** is the **hour of decline**,\n**You** is the **hour of punishment**,\nAnd **water** is the **hour of calamity**.\nThis is the **Shuiyuan Star**.*\n\n*For those born under the **Earth Command**—\nTheir **origin of life and death** is in **Xu**,\nAnd **Xu** is the **hour of the king and minister**,\n**Xu** embodies **blessing and virtue**,\n**Wei** is the **hour of rest**,\n**Shen** is the **hour of decline**,\n**Mao** is the **hour of punishment**,\nAnd **wood** is the **hour of calamity**.\nThis is the **Zhuyuan Star**.*\n\n*Now, those who cultivate must first practice the **Yugong Steps**,\nThen the **Northern Dipper**,\nThen the **Central Dipper**—\nThe **Central Dipper** is called the **Heavenly Ruler**,\nThus one **leaps in flight**.\nNext, the **Three Platforms**,\nThen the **Five Stars**.\n\nThey then employ the **twelfth incantation** from the **upper volume of the Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl Talisman**,\nThe **Flying Heavenly Ruler incantation**,\nAnd petition the **Primordial Qi** of the **Yuan Star** (the **Lord of the Mysterious Body and Longevity**)—\nTo command the **Primordial Qi** of the **Zhen Star** (the **Lord of the Soil and the Subduing Qi**),\nSo that **punishment and calamity** may not be recklessly imposed.\n\nIf **punishment and calamity** are imposed upon the **Primordial Qi** of the **Yuan Star**,\nThe **Star Lord** and the **Qingtong Lord** will sever and restrain it—\nSwiftly, as decreed by law.\n\nThe rest follows this pattern.\n\nWithin the *Five Stars Sacred Scripture*,\nThere are already **Five Stars Talismans** to be used,\nTo restrain the **punishment and calamity** of the **Five Phases**,\nAnd preserve **Primordial Qi**.\n\nThe **origin of life and death** refers to one’s **parents**—\n**Annotation:** The **parents**’ **commands** are **golden wood**.\nIf their **commands** clash with one’s own,\nUse a **talisman** to halt the **clash**—\nFor if one’s own **command** does not clash with theirs,\nThen the **origin of life and death** (i.e., **Primordial Qi**) will be made clear.\n*For example:* If a **mother’s command** is **gold** and a **child’s command** is **wood**,\nThe **mother’s command** restrains the **child’s command**—\nThe child will then not live long,\nBut with a **talisman** to halt the **clash**, both **mother and child** will be auspicious.\n\nIf a **mother’s command** is **earth** and a **child’s command** is **wood**,\nThe **child’s command** restrains the **mother’s command**—\nAgain, use the **Five Phases talisman** to halt the **clash**, and both **mother and child** will be auspicious.\n**Annotation:** The rest follows this pattern.\n\nThis principle speaks of the **Primordial Qi** of the **origin of life and death**,\nNot clashing or restraining—\nFor those who cultivate the **Dao/Way**, it brings great fortune,\nAnd they may wear the **Five Phases talisman** to restrain and subdue **calamities**.\n\nUpon completion,\nRecite the **incantation of the parents’ origin of life and death**,\nAnd employ the **talisman to restrain punishment and calamity** for oneself.\n**Annotation:** For example, if one is born under the **Golden Command**,\n**Fire** is the **punishment and calamity**—\nThe **talisman** is detailed in the **Five Phases Palm Talismans**.\n\nThe **invocation** goes thus:\n*\"I was born of my **parents**,\nAnd grew long within the **mundane world**.\nSo it is.\"*\n\nThe **incantations** are found in the **upper volume of the Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl Talisman**—\nThere are two of them.\n\nAfter reciting the **incantation**,\nWalk the **Yugong Steps of the origin of life and death**—\nTwelve steps in total—\nTo restrain **calamities of the origin of life and death**,\nAnd perform this each time one reaches their **native command day**.\n\nAfter completing the **Yugong Steps**,\nOne again invokes:\n*\"I was born of my parents.\"*\nAnd so forth—\nThis is the **later incantation**.\nThe incantation is also from the same source.\n\nIf practiced at birth,\nIn the first year, it wards off misfortune.\nIn the second year, **Metal and Wood** do not clash, **Water and Fire** do not harm.\nIn the third year, one departs death and enters life.\nIn the fourth year, one attains **Earthly Authenticity**, and others resolve one’s **origin-of-life calamities and misfortunes**.\nAt twenty years, one is named **Celestial Authenticity**, ranked among the **Celestial Hosts**, as the **origin-qi of the Three Five**.\n\nNext, one is listed among the **Three Five’s born**.\n\n**Annotation:** The Three refers to **Heaven, Earth, and Man**—the **Three Talents, Three Origins**.\nEach Talent resides in one Origin, hence called the **Three Origins**.\n**Annotation:** The **Upper Origin** governs Heaven, the **Middle Origin** governs Man, the **Lower Origin** governs Earth—\nThey are called the **Three Origin Generals**.\nOne general per Origin commands officers and soldiers; each Origin gathers **three million ten thousand troops**.\nThe **Ancient Highest Dao Lord** received this from **Yuan Shi**, who passed it to the **Dao Lord**.\n**Annotation:** When the Dao Lord emerged, it was the **Age of the Heavenly Sovereign**, before laws existed among mortals.\n\nThe **Upper Origin Upper Division General**, one in number, surnamed **Tang**, named **Short**,\nWith divine strength and valor, his transformed body nine thousand million *zhang* long,\nLeading soldiers, wielding sword and bow,\nWith nine thousand million troops,\nOverseeing the **Supreme Great Luo** above the **Three Pure Ones of Heaven**.\n\n**Annotation:** The **Jade Pure, Upper Pure, and Supreme Pure** are these.\n\nThe **Upper Origin Middle Division**\n**Annotation:** The Middle Division is the **Upper Origin Middle General**, governing the **one within a person’s body**—\nAlso mirroring Heaven and Earth, aligning the body with Heaven and Earth, all aspects complete and identical.\nOne general, surnamed **Li**.\n**Annotation:** Because **Laozi** bore the surname Li, he ordered it changed to Li.\nNamed **Jù**,\nHis body seven thousand million *zhang* long,\nLeading soldiers, wielding sword and spear,\nWith seven thousand million troops.\nAbove the **Supreme Three Pure**, entering the human body,\nHe excels in dispelling **Celestial Net snares**, **Five Phase calamities**, and **Earthly misfortunes**.\nOnly **General Li** can greatly assist human strength,\nAble to remove **Celestial origin-of-life calamities**.\n**Annotation:** The ancients forged this [talisman] from gold, one *cun* long, worn in a crimson pouch on the head—\nIt excels in saving people during calamities.\n\nThe **Upper Origin Lower Division General**, one in number, surnamed **Eastern Sea Ancient Surname**.\nNow, the **Holy One** changes it to **Xu**.\nNamed **Kang**,\nHis body five thousand million *zhang* long,\nLeading soldiers, wielding sword and **Jade Yang Node**,\nWith five thousand million troops.\nAbove the **Upper Pure**, entering the human body,\nHe excels in healing diseases,\nDissipating **Celestial, Ten Directions, Nine Earths’ origin-of-life calamities, misfortunes, and Five Phase mutual destruction and assaults**—\nAble to dispel these with Dao power.\n\nThere are also **Three Origin Three Functionaries**, three in total.\nUnder the **Upper Origin Upper Division General Tang**, the **Five Just Gods Functionary**, one, surnamed **Jiang**, named **Dú**,\nHis body nine hundred ninety *zhang* long,\nLeading **hundreds of millions of layered troops**, in crimson robes and red headgear,\nHolding a **golden talisman**, wielding a sword,\nStationed above **Great Luo**.\n\nUnder the **Upper Origin Middle Division General Li**, the **Five Just Gods Functionary**, one, surnamed **Zhang**, named **Jì**,\nHis body seven hundred seventy *zhang* long,\nLeading **hundreds of millions of layered troops**, in red armor,\nRight hand holding a spear, sword at the waist,\nStationed within the **Supreme Pole**.\n\nUnder the **Upper Origin Lower Division General Xu**, the **Five Just Gods Functionary**, one, surnamed **Wēn**, named **Shū**,\nHis body five hundred fifty *zhang* long,\nLeading **hundreds of millions of layered troops**, in red headgear,\nRight hand holding the **Jade Yang Node**, sword at the waist.\n**Annotation:** Above the **Supreme Great Luo Heaven**, both above and below Heaven,\nAnd entering the **right kidney** within a person.\n\nThe **Three Origin Functionaries**, entering and exiting,\nEach pass through the **eyebrow’s Heavenly Gate**,\nGreatly enabling one to attain **Law and Technique**,\nTo bark and command **ghosts, tigers, leopards, venomous snakes, malevolent men, poisonous dragons, spirits, demons, and specters**.\nThis recounts the names of the **Three Origin Upper Division Generals**.\n**Annotation:** The **Upper Origin Upper Division General**, one, surnamed **Tang**, named **Short**.\nThe **Upper Origin Middle Division General**, one, surnamed **Li**, named **Jù**.\nThe **Upper Origin Lower Division General**, one, surnamed **Xu**, named **Kang**.\nTogether with the **Three Functionaries**, these are the **Upper Origin’s division**, governing Heaven.\n\nThe **Middle Origin’s Three Generals** emerged in the **Ancient Age of the Human Sovereign**,\nWhen three ministers practiced the Dao alongside the Human Sovereign, achieving completion—\nThey obtained the **Middle Origin’s Three Generals**.\n**Annotation:** Their names were **Fēng Ān, Luò Qiáng, and Tiān Shēng**.\n\nLater, in the **Zhou Mu Wang era**, three ministers replaced the earlier **Fēng Ān** and others.\nThere were also three successors:\n**Táng Hóng**,\n**Annotation:** Serving as **Grand Counselor**, equivalent to today’s **Chancellor**.\nAlso holding the titles of **Grand Tutor and Grand Minister**.\n**Gě Yōng**,\n**Annotation:** Serving as **Attendant Lord and Chief of Rites**, equivalent to today’s **Grand Master of Rites**.\nWith the courtesy name **Wén Dù**.\n**Zhōu Wǔ**,\n**Annotation:** Serving as **Attendant Marshal**, equivalent to today’s **Right Marshal**, holding the same rank as the **Right Chancellor**.\n\nThe three studied the Dao, following **Mu Wang** in practicing the **Six Jia, Three Origin, Nine Palace Method**,\nThen resigned their offices.\n**Mu Wang** obtained the **Cave Palace Immortal**, hidden in **Wangwu Mountain**, feigning death and departing—\nNone could find him.\nThey then devoted themselves to refining **Embryonic Breath, Qi Cultivation, and Golden Elixir**,\nTaking three doses but failing to ascend—\nOnly achieving immortality, living over five hundred years in **Emèi and Taibai Mountains**.\n\nThe three swore an oath, seeking the **Perfect Ones**,\nAspiring to the **Perfect Dao**, ascending to Heaven in broad daylight.\nNow we know of the **Upper Realm’s new Highest Dao, Great Peace Golden Gate, Mysterious Origin Holy Emperor, Jade Dao Lord**—\nWe now pledge our sincerest hearts,\nWishing these three may serve as ministers beneath him.\n\nWith hearts most sincere, we vow to walk the Dao with the Jade Emperor,\nAspiring to serve and assist him below.\nWe receive the Dao’s chosen, amassing countless merits—\nYet dare not claim credit for our deeds.\n\nEver bearing a heart of salvation,\nWe beseech the Heavenly Emperor of the Golden Gate, Mysterious Origin, Great Peace, and Supreme Dao—\nMay he, in his boundless grace, perceive and bless those who pray.\n\nAfter three years of practice,\nWe indeed encountered him upon Taibai Mountain.\nIn the second year of Qin’s *More Begins* (July 7th),\nThe Jade Emperor of the Golden Gate, Mysterious Origin, Great Peace, and Supreme Dao descended upon Taibai Mountain—\n*(Anciently called Dayuan White Heaven Mountain).*\n\nHe conferred upon Tang Hong and the other two the *Fifteen-Juan Scripture of the Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl (Sanwu Jin Suo Liu Zhu Jing)*,\nAnd the method of *Treading the Celestial Halter and Earthly Records*.\n\nEach practiced for three years, attaining *Earthly Authenticity*.\n*(Authenticity: the power to enforce prohibitions and heal many illnesses.)*\n\nThe Supreme Posterior Sage Lord rejoiced at their Dao,\nTheir true and sincere hearts—\nAnd immediately granted them further instruction.\nAfter ten years, he descended again,\nConferring upon them *Ten-Juan of the Induction Decisions*.\n\nThe three practiced day and night for two years,\nAnd indeed ascended as immortals,\nGaining audience with the Posterior Sage Lord,\nAppointed to fill the rank of *Three Great Generals of the Middle Element*,\nOverseeing the *Three Heavenly Rectification Methods*,\nWearing the Dipper as clothing—\nClothing the Dipper, sandaling the Dipper, riding the Dipper,\nDonning the Dipper, aligning with the Dipper, inverting the Dipper,\nReversing the Dipper, crossing the Dipper, lowering the Dipper,\nOpposing the Dipper, raising the Dipper, sitting upon the Dipper,\nWalking the Dipper, reclining upon the Dipper.\n*(Reclining upon the Dipper: Before closing the outer eyes,\nVisualize the Dipper covering your body like a quilt,\nConforming to the celestial Dipper’s position by lunar mansion.)*\n\nPointing the Dipper, summoning the Dipper, commanding the Dipper,\nLeading the Dipper, firming the Dipper, yielding the Dipper,\nYin-Dipper, Yang-Dipper, Perverse-Dipper, Rectified-Dipper,\nSeizing the Dipper, capturing the Dipper, executing the Dipper.\n*(Steps of the Dipper to execute and behead ghosts.)*\n\nRestraining the Dipper,\n*(Visualizing the Seven Stars in step-form to suppress malevolence,\nForming the Dipper’s proper shape as a net,\nCovering the prison of the Grand Duke to bind and restrain ghosts and spirits below.)*\n\nContaining the Dipper,\n*(Encompassing the Seven Stars within the heart and abdomen,\nIlluminating the Five Viscera.)*\n\nExpanding the Dipper,\n*(Filling heaven and earth to dispel demons and evil.)*\n\nAnd other such methods.\nTogether with the *Yugbu Steps*, they perfected the Rectification Methods,\nInstantly stirring winds and rains as heaven and earth obeyed their will.\n\nThe Jade Emperor of the Golden Gate, Great Peace, and Supreme Dao\nGranted them armies of thirty million soldiers,\nAlong with the *Rectification Talismans of the Three Generals* and the *Yugbu Steps*,\nAnd the *Twenty-Four Stages of Step Prohibitions*—\nInstantly capable of salvation techniques.\nWhen merits were complete, they ascended to their celestial abode,\nAs if dwelling within the grottoes.\n\nThose who received the talismans wielded them as thought answered hand,\nDivine power manifesting instantly.\nThus, they could ascend to the heavens,\nServing beside the Sage Lord of the Golden Gate,\nAs middle-ranking Daoist generals,\nGuarding the palaces,\nPursuing and subduing demon kings,\nRecording the Three Officials’ affairs.\n\nThey could also protect those who practiced the talismans and step-prohibitions.\nHumans who refined their hearts and thoughts to manifest these powers\nMastered the Three Diagrams.\n*(The first two diagrams: one encompassing the body, the second deploying its use,\nThe third encompassing the shadow—\nTheir essence lies in visualization,\nEntering and exiting the heart and kidneys.)*\n\nWhen applied, the body lengthened by an inch,\nEmerging from the heart and kidneys,\nGradually growing to eighty-one *zhang*,\nLeading armies of thirty million soldiers,\nOr capturing malevolent crowds,\nOr entering through the brow to heal Five Viscera ailments—\nThe body lengthening by an inch within the heart and kidneys,\nCalming the Five Viscera and hundred vessels.\n\nGuarding steadied the Five Viscera.\n*(The resolve: day and night, Tang General entered the left kidney,\nGe General entered the right kidney,\nZhou General entered the heart,\nPacifying the Five Viscera and hundred vessels,\nEradicating all demonic, malevolent *qi*, and disease roots.)*\n\nThis is the origin of the *Posterior Three Elements*.\n*(At the time of the Posterior Sage Lord—Qin’s First Emperor—\nIn the second year of *More Begins*, July 7th,\nDescending upon Taibai Mountain in Shu.)*\n\nThe Three Middle Element Generals were originally appointed by the Sage Lord of Great Peace.\nThey were granted the rank of *Daylight Ascension Generals*,\nCapable of traversing heaven and earth, water and fire,\nEncompassing the extremes of heaven and earth,\nOr entering the human body,\nDispelling evil and protecting the rectified—\nLike frost before the sun.\nThus, they could always exert influence over those of virtuous conduct.\n\nWhen confronting malevolent ghosts and spirits,\nThey preserved the body and aided the state,\nTheir talismans fulfilling their merits,\nTheir resolve fixed upon ascension—\nWithin the heart, never lost—\nThus, they could firm their resolve,\nAnd wisdom arose within them.\n\nThis must be done in the Middle Element,\nWith united strength to save others.\n*(Humans, through talismans and orders, command the generals and soldiers,\nRescuing those in peril, curing diseases,\nMountains and seas as lips and teeth,\nPoisons, fierce beasts, dragons, and water calamities—\nAll are delivered.)*\n\nThis is the function of *united strength*—\nWhen humans and spirits alike gain merit through talismans,\nIt is called *salvation*.\nThose who attain salvation rejoice,\nKnowing the Dao’s transformation.\nThis is the benevolent function of the Three Middle Element Generals.\n\nThe Three Middle Element Generals first emerged in the age of the Human Sovereign,\nAnd through the Dao, moved heaven to bestow upon them,\nProtecting the Human Sovereign.\n\nLater, when the Three Generals were first appointed as replacements,\nIt was the Posterior Sage Lord who petitioned the Supreme Dao Lord,\nAnd conferred them upon Zhang Daoling—\nThus, it is said they were first appointed by the Posterior Sage Lord.\n*(As recorded in the *Scripture of the Dao’s Mysterious Authenticity*:*\nThe Three Middle Element Generals, three in number,\nBefore the ancient Human Sovereign,\nWere bestowed by the Supreme Dao Lord, the Primordial Sovereign of the Void,\nUpon Taiyi,\nWho became their commander,\nLeading the Taiyi Palace.)*\n\nThis is the benevolent petition of the Posterior Sage Lord to the Jade Sovereign,\nTo summon from the lower realm those who have attained the Dao,\nAs replacements for the first three.\n\nThe previous three attained the Dao by descending from the **ascended-true** position\nTo the lower realm, thus replacing the Three Elements’ ranks.\n\nThe Posterior Sage Lord petitioned to enter the lower realm,\nEstablishing the **Orthodox One** (正一) for protection,\nAssisting those who have received the Dao,\nAnd binding all **structured hearts** (结心).\nUsing seals and finger gestures,\nFollowing the **sacred talismans** (符箓) and their commands,\nThose who receive the talismans today\nCan make **structured laws** (结法) step in accordance,\nAnd verify their efficacy immediately.\n\nThe sons of the Dao, after receiving the Way,\nGain the **gestures** (诀) and follow their teacher’s precepts in movement, dwelling, sitting, and repose,\nEnduring like the **Forgetful Sitting** (坐忘),\nBinding and twisting the **gestures** (捻诀).\nSeals (印) are stored in thought as the diagram shows.\nAfter one year, they are free from illness,\nAnd can instantly dispel evil to aid others.\nAfter two years, they repel soldiers,\nAnd malevolent ghosts, fierce beasts, all submit.\nAfter three years, they remove the **deadly records** (死籍),\nAnd in the fourth year, they restore the **Orthodox One’s true essence** (正一地真).\nBy the fifth year, they achieve **divine penetration** (神通),\nWith godly power unsurpassed—\nTheir fingers alone can subdue the wicked, who all bow in submission.\nTheir hearts must not act rashly.\nWhen moving, they must be those who harm themselves,\nOr those they cannot avoid.\nThey must grasp the **root gesture** (本诀),\nAnd in secret, visualize the **Battle Robe** (斗衣) upon their body,\nThe **Battle Fish** (斗魒) in their fingers’ motion,\nAs the Three Middle Element Generals\nCommand armies of three hundred million each,\nAnd strike down water, fire, lions, and poisonous snakes one by one—\nThey must all be subdued by the heart,\nAnd die without harming oneself.\nIf they do not submit,\nTwist the **wicked talisman** (凶恶刀支),\nAnd command it to cut and pierce again—\nThey will respond by vomiting blood and dying.\nRecite in secret the **Five Phases Incantation** (五行咒):\nMetal conquers wood, water extinguishes fire, and so forth.\nThis is the **Yin** method—\nCaution must be taken, and it must not be recklessly employed.\nThe Daoist must resort to it only when necessary.\nAgain, the **gesture of command** (使诀) is taken\nFrom the second joint of the left thumb, near the left side.\n*(Near the left means the joint must be close to the left edge.)*\nBut it governs the Three Elements, Three Divisions, and Nine Generals,\nTotally overseeing the second joint.\nThe **Upper Element** (上元) governs the **Rectified Heart** (正心),\nAnd the **Lower Element** (下元) is on the left—\nAlways store and apply it as depicted in the diagram.\nFor men and women, the **gesture of command** (诀) is the left hand for men,\nAnd the right hand for women.\nAlways store and apply it without confusion or recklessness,\n*(Without letting illusions deceive the heart, without wrongly applying it to the virtuous.)*\nInstantly attaining the **Heavenly True** (天真),\nEvil and poison—\n*(Evil: the malevolent kings and demonic qi. Poison: serpents, dragons, ghosts, and beasts.)*\n—must stand in awe and respect,\nAnd benevolence must be extended—\n*(Those who follow the Dao, using talismanic arts,\nConstantly relieve the poor, the sick, and those in distress,\nExerting compassionate power to rescue people from calamity,\nPracticing benevolent virtue and teaching the worthy.)*\nDivine penetration enables the eyes to endure and the body to firm.\nThe **Master Guangcheng** (广成子) instructed the Yellow Sovereign:\n*\"If you wish to seek the True,\nNothing surpasses firming the body.\nIf you wish to firm the body,\nNothing surpasses divine penetration.\nAfter divine penetration,\n*(To attain vision of the gods, there are six stages:\n1. Receiving the talismanic method.\n2. Cleansing the heart and guarding the secrets—\nDo not divulge them to the unworthy.\n3. Obtaining the True Scripture,\nTransmitted by a True Teacher.\n4. Grasping the essential principles fully.\n5. Acquiring this **invitation** (引),\nA dedicated practitioner who enters the gate to see the Dao.\n6. Once seeing the gate and path,\nPracticing the method,\nGaining the **gesture** (诀),\nAll applications will be without error.)*\nThese six stages of practice\nAll hinge on the **gesture** (诀)—\nWithout this **gesture**, the other five matters are useless.\nIn the present age, those who receive the talismanic method\nReach its peak in the **Upper Purity** (上清),\nAnd combine **teachings of sound and doctrine** (声教) with fasting and reciting the Dao,\nTheir incense and flames never ceasing,\nTheir hearts kept pure without retreat,\nFulfilling all four prior matters,\nAnd practicing the **Forgetful Sitting** (老一生) for a lifetime—\nYet none have attained it.\nAll must seek a **Clear Teacher** (明师),\nWho transmits the **invitation gesture** (引诀) and **seal** (印),\nOnly then can divine penetration be achieved.\nOnce divine penetration is attained,\nBut the Dao is not yet realized,\nRealizing the Dao requires the **Clear Teacher’s further gesture** (明师再诀),\nTo **degree the heart and spirit** (度心神).\nThe heart and spirit must not rise to idle thoughts,\n*(Forgetting to add protective measures for oneself and others.)*\nOnly then can one **degree the Dao** (度道),\nAttaining realization—\nMany have ascended in broad daylight, their dwellings plucked up.\nAs for the **Heavenly Masters** (天师), **Xu Xun** (许逊), **Wang Chang** (王长), and the **Emperor’s younger brothers** (尹子兄弟),\nAnd the disciples of the **Three Sovereigns of ancient times** (上古三皇之徒),\nThey all plucked up entire cities and departed—\nNone failed to do so\nBecause of the **Upper, Middle, and Lower Three Elements**, the **Nine Generals of the Five Virtues and Six Regulations** (五德六纪等将军),\nAnd the **Seven Stars’ Essence and Five Battles’ Host of Stars** (七星精五斗众星),\nAs well as the **Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water** (天地水三官),\nAnd all the **divine ranks and true immortals** (众神众真仙灵) and **generals and soldiers** (将军吏兵)\nRecorded in the *Scripture of the Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl* (《金锁流珠》) **fifteen volumes**—\nThose who fully master these methods\nCan ascend in broad daylight,\nOr pluck up their dwellings and depart together.\n\nIn ancient times, during the **Zhou dynasty** (周时),\nA **Hu deity** (西国胡神) from the Western lands attained the Dao—\nThis was when the **Supreme Sage Lord** (太上老君) instructed **Master Wu Cheng** (务成子),\nAnd taught the **Hu King** (胡王).\nAgain entrusting the **body’s framework and essential gestures** (托身纲诀之法),\nHe became the **Rightmost True Person of the Mysterious** (右玄真人),\nServing the **Supreme Sage Lord of the Great Equality, Golden Threshold, and Mysterious Origin** (大平金阙玄元后圣玉皇帝上道君),\nAlso attaining **degree** (度) through this method.\nWith an **equal and balanced heart** (平等心),\nHe possessed the **virtue of neither wrong nor idle application** (不非不妄之德).\nHis name was **Earth Geography** (地理),\nAnd his strength could match a thousand men.\n\nThe Three Sons of Earth Sovereign—Earth Monarchs—\nand the Five Sons of Earth Kings,\nthree brothers of equal rank,\npossessed mighty strength, courage, and relentless vigor,\nwith wisdom surpassing mortals.\nSince they bore no name, they were ennobled as the **Three Great Daoist Marshals of the Lower Primordial**,\ncommanding armies to guard and protect those who attained **degree** and received **fa箓**.\n\n*Note: The Later Sage now replaces these three, thus taking their surname as his own,\nand their former titles as their given names.*\n\nThe present **Three Marshals of the Lower Primordial**—\nsurnamed **Li**, **Huang**, and **Wang**—\nare the names of those three predecessors.\n\nIf mortals seek the Dao without knowing the origins of the **Upper, Middle, and Lower Primordial Three Great Marshals**,\nnot one in ten thousand can attain it.\nYet even now, those who glimpse the Dao\nshall fulfill their eon’s measure.\n\n*Note: When the three Marshals complete their term,\nthe Later Sage replaces them—\nthe Li, Huang, and Wang—\nand the Later Sage’s Lord seals them as Marshals,\nreplacing their former ranks.*\n\nWhen the former ascended as **Heavenly True Ones**,\nthose who followed assumed their roles,\nleading and protecting those with resolve in cultivation,\nand governing the **Lower Primordial** beings of earth and water,\nas well as malevolent spirits, dragons, ghosts, and demons\nwho act without righteousness.\n\n*Note: All things with qi crave life and fear death,\nconstantly seeking the Dao of life within them.\nWicked and cruel beings, who act in demonic ways,\nusing beasts, serpents, and dragons—\nall must be exterminated and annihilated.\nWhether human, spirit, dragon, or ghost,\nall are judged and destroyed by law.\nThis is the command of the **Upper, Middle, and Lower Primordial Nine Great Marshals**.*\n\nTheir orders consist of six decrees:\n1. **Subdue celestial demons.**\n2. **Restrain evil men** who do not walk the righteous path,\n   nor defy sovereigns and masters.\n3. **Always protect the Dao and its laws,**\n   rescuing those in suffering, poverty, and distress.\n4. **Tame dragons, ghosts, and demons**,\n   forbidding false sorcery—\n   those who transgress shall be executed.\n5. **Respond to the sincere hearts of those seeking the Dao,**\n   regardless of noble or common birth, male or female.\n\n*Note: The Great Dao does not discriminate between high and low.\nIf one has Daoic nature, a sincere heart, and receives the **fa箓** for cultivation,\ntheir merit shall be acknowledged.\nThe Nine Marshals shall protect such individuals and their families\nfrom all magical calamities.\nThey shall ensure no misfortune befall them,\nand all suffering shall be transcended through **degree**.*\n\n6. **Constantly guard the Perfected Ones**,\n   whether in motion, rest, sitting, or lying,\n   shielding them from external demons.\nThey shall swiftly report urgent matters,\nsubmitting petitions and memorials to the Celestial Throne,\nensuring harmony with Heaven’s will,\nrewarding virtue without failing in ritual propriety.\nWhen their merit is complete, they shall uplift those of resolve in the Dao,\ngranting them **degree** and ascension in broad daylight,\nwith the power to depart their dwellings.\nThose who attain Daoist transcendence\nshall reside in the **Three Pure Ones**.\n\nThe **Upper, Middle, and Lower Primordial Nine Marshals**\nshall each ascend to the rank of **Supreme True Daoist of the Great Primordial and Great Extremes**,\nfollowing the succession of the **Three Sovereigns’ Three Primordial Marshals**.\n\n*Note: \"Ascend\" means attaining the rank of Daoist True Ones.\n\"Replace\" means each takes the rightful position of the three who preceded them.*\n\nThus, even within the **Release School**,\nthey are secretly called **Buddhas**.\nThe method of **sealing with the seal**—\nthis is the **heart-seal**.\nThis diagram speaks of **invoking, drawing, and manipulating the talismans**.\n\n**Degree** is achieved through an **equal heart**.\n*Note: The heart attains **degree** through equality,\nnot through receiving **degree** in the form of robes or garments—\nsuch things are futile.*\n\n**No haste, no harm.**\n*Note: The True Heart is without deceit, without haste, without jealousy—\nthis is the nature of the True Person.*\n\n**No desire.**\n*Note: Those who love and cling to things,\nwhen they obtain them, rejoice;\nwhen they do not, they grow angry.\nThe True Person’s nature is free from such attachments—\ngain and loss, possession and deprivation—\nthe heart’s thoughts are inherently without,\nthus called the True Person.*\n\n**Able to practice the Three Grades.**\n*Note: Firming the body is the first,\ncommuning with spirits the second,\nand attaining **degree** of the heart is the third.\nTrue Persons constantly practice these three grades.*\n\n**The body itself contains the spirit.**\n*Note: The body and spirit are inherently complete,\nlike an image contained within a mirror—\nwhen invoked, it responds as a substitute.\nLike the image within the diagram,\nnothing remains unanswered.*\n\n**All affairs are made manifest.**\n*Note: When the True Person’s heart conceives a thought,\nthe object is immediately obtained,\nand all malevolence vanishes.*\n\nThe **Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water**\nall share the same heart.\n\n*Note: Those who cultivate the Supreme Dao to become True Persons,\nwith hearts of compassion and boundless salvation,\nharmonize with the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water,\ngenerating and restraining all things,\nfulfilling the transformations of ten thousand beings.*\n\nThe **Three Marshals of the Lower Primordial**\nfirst emerged in the **Highest Antiquity**.\nIn the **Earth Sovereign’s era**,\nthe **Nine Princes**—\n*Note: The Nine Princes, born of three mothers—*\nlearned the Dao alongside their parents.\n\nIn the time of the **Supreme Sage Lord**,\nhe was called the **Great Dao Lord of the Five Spirits**,\nor the **Supreme Master of the Boundless**,\nor the **Nameless Lord**.\n\n*Note: According to the *Inner Transmission of the Supreme Sage Lord*,\nthe Supreme Sage Lord, born before Heaven and Earth,\nsurnamed Li, named Yuan, with the title **Wenchu Tianwang**.\nBefore the era of **Pangu**,\nhe was called the **Primordial Heavenly Venerable, the Void Sovereign, the Great Dao Lord**.\nIn the era of Pangu, he was called the **Supreme Dao Lord**.\nIn the **Heavenly Sovereign’s era**, he was called the **Highest Sage Lord**.\nIn the **Earth Sovereign’s era**, he was called the **Nameless Lord**.\nIn the **Human Sovereign’s era**, he was called the **Ever-Present Lord**.\n\nIt was then that the **Upper, Middle, and Lower Primordial Nine Great Marshals**\nwere first established—\nall were those whom the Later Sage’s Lord, in past and present,\nhad **degreed** and ennobled as Marshals,\nto guide later seekers of the Dao,\nstrengthening themselves while saving others from sickness,\nand teaching those with Daoic nature.*\n\nHe expounded the *Earth Interior Classic* in fourteen chapters\n*Note: This is precisely the *Golden Fa Book*,\ndiscussing the methods of **swallowing the sun and expelling the moon**,\nas well as the principles of **correctly stepping on the Big Dipper’s robes** and **consuming the stars’ qi**.*\n\nThe Earth Sovereign practiced it for fourteen years\nand attained the Dao.\nThe Nine Princes also practiced it,\nand were ennobled as Marshals.\n\nAfter fourteen years of cultivation,\nthe Earth Sovereign ascended in broad daylight to the **Qingwei Heaven**,\nand was titled **Xian Qing**.\n\n「The Nine Princes followed their father-king in cultivation for fifteen years,\nand likewise ascended in broad daylight to the **Celestial Palace**,\ntheir ranks ennobled as **Marshal of the Long***.\n*Note: The Marshal’s position is to guard and perpetually protect.*\n\nThe **Highest Venerable Sage-Lao** originally decreed:\n*\"The Great Dao produces One,\nOne produces Two,\nTwo produces Three.\nThis is its beginning—\nthe Upper Element* governs celestial phenomena*.\n*Note: Celestial phenomena include the sun, moon, and starry hosts,\nas well as the officials, palaces, gates, and celestial enclosures,\nthe sources of the rivers and clouds and mists,\nand the patterns of rain, snow, frost, and **qi**.*\n\nThe Middle Element governs humans and spirits*.\n*Note: Humans and spirits include divine dragons, ghostly essences,\nferocious beasts, and sacred birds of the kind.*\n\nThe Lower Element governs the earth and water realms*.\n*Note: The earth and water realms include dragons and sea serpents,\nfish and scaled creatures, and armored beings of the kind.*\n\nTen thousand spirits, a hundred thousand souls—\nall are under the dominion of the Lower Element’s Three Marshals.\n\nWith the **Correct Dao** bestowed upon their armies,\neach commands thirty million troops,\ntheir bodies stretching nine *zhang* long—or three *zhang*,\nwearing red headbands and towering caps,\nor yellow headbands and towering caps,\nclad in armor and wielding swords,\nthey oversee the **Earth Officials**,\nreverse the records of calamity, sickness, and death*,\nand register names for rebirth.\n\nThen **Xuan Qing** commands them to recite the **Lower Element’s incantation***,\n*Note: The Lower Element’s Three Marshals’ incantation,\nalso known as the \"One on the Left Edge, One is Left\" incantation.*\n*and to wear the **Lower Element’s talisman diagram**,\nas well as the **Ghostly Spear’s talisman diagram**,\nand to tread the **Earth Measure**,\nand the **Yujia Step—three steps, nine traces**—in its essentials,\nand to

eighteen verses—recite them all.\nThe second spell commands the Six Palaces of the **Yin Officials**,\nfound later in the text.\nThe spell commanding the Six Palaces of the **Yin Officials** is also revealed by the Later Sage.*\n\nThe spell says:\n*\"I am a disciple of the Highest Venerable Sage,\nand subordinate to the Six Heavens.\nThe Six Heavens’ palaces are under my command.\nNot only are

Dao—\nZhang Daoling, Zhao Sheng, Wang Chang, the Marshal of the Five Commands,\nLi Zhongfu, Mao Ying, Xu Yufu, and others.\nThe Daoist immortal Li Chunfeng annotated and preserved\nthe laws of the Zhou General’s diagram.\"*\n\nThe Celestial Master said: *\"Why is Zhou General placed last in the scrolls?*\nThe Most High Laozi spoke: *Because Zhou General is the master of the human heart, and thus the heart is the sovereign spirit of the body. Therefore, Zhou General was composed first as the foremost of the Three Mid-Autumn Generals in the *Flowing Pearl* scrolls. However, according to the *Zheng San Yuan Jing*, the Mid-Autumn Upper Division begins with Tang General, followed by Ge General, and then Zhou General. Now, though arranged first by the Most High’s decree, its application must follow the order prescribed in the *San Yuan Zheng Jing*.\n\nThe method’s purpose is to impart the Most High’s oral transmission—the essential formula of Mid-Autumn’s core technique. First, tread the *Ji* [纪] five times, then disperse into the *Yu Bu* [禹步], three steps with nine traces. Upon completion, adjust the clothing seven times, meditating as prescribed. Then, first visualize Tang General alone within the left kidney, emerging from there—initially only one inch tall, then expanding to eight *zhang*—commanding thirty million troops to a specific province, county, village, or household to address a matter. *Note: This may involve seizing malevolent spirits, a malefactor, or performing exorcisms to cure illness, or confronting malevolent spirits, officials, or those plotting against you. Visualize accordingly, and one image shall suffice for later use.*\n\nThe Later Sage-King instructed Master Zhang: *The Three Elements’ method—note: the Upper, Middle, and Lower Elements govern Heaven, Earth, and Humanity—is for cultivating the Dao, safeguarding one’s family, and subduing malevolence. *Note: ‘Malevolence’ refers to humans; ‘evil’ refers to spirits.* It must not be used for personal aggrandizement but also to rescue others from all calamities. One may then tread the *Ji* three times, disperse into the *Yu Bu*, and adjust the clothing. Upon completion, recite the incantation: ‘I was born of my parents, raised among the vulgar…’ *This incantation appears in the *Di Ji Jing* as the pre-incantation. The formula is on the second joint of the left hand’s first finger.*\n\nLaozi said: *Zhou General is the human heart-spirit. If one practices the Dao to attain spiritual communion, the moment intention arises, action follows—no need for ritualized stepping or complete formalities. *Note: ‘Complete formalities’ means first treading the *Ji*, then the *Yu Bu*, adjusting the clothing, and finally pinching the formula while reciting to manifest. The first stage of cultivation requires these steps, for though beginners may receive scriptures and complete the rites—*note: receiving scriptures and rites is from the *Zhengyi* tradition’s Five Methods of Shangqing*—they must still practice stepping to attain spiritual efficacy. *Note: ‘Stepping’ refers to the Heavenly Halberd; ‘treading’ refers to the Earthly Measure.* Only then does one achieve communion with spirits. *Note: In ancient times, Liu Jiang’s wife, Lady Fan, secretly practiced the Heavenly Halberd and Earthly Measure for fourteen years without her husband’s knowledge. She would act only when he was absent, even during his official duties as county magistrate. One day, a divine being descended on five-colored clouds, accompanied by twenty-four attendants—four celestial boys and four celestial girls—and spoke to Lady Fan: ‘Your merit is complete, your power attained. Now you may act by thought alone—what do you desire?’ Lady Fan replied: ‘I wish to make water stand still and a riding tiger not harm.’ The divine being said: ‘A small matter.’*\"*\n\nThe divine being then imparted to Lady Fan the method to **halt water** and the **talisman to subdue tigers**, saying:\n*\"Practice this, and you shall see results immediately. Continue your diligent cultivation for another fourteen years, and you may ascend to heaven when you will—or remain in the world, rich and noble.\"* Indeed, later, the couple ascended together as **Celestial Immortals**.\n\nWhen one’s mind is focused, responses manifest instantly—**heaven and earth resonate in harmony**. If one has not yet attained communion with spirits, the practice must be performed with **ritual stepping and treading**, fully observing the diagrams and incantations, visualizing the spirit attuned to the **sacred robe**, and chanting as one acts. One must also **keep the General Zhou in mind**.\n\nWhen the heart is fully devoted, communion is achieved. With a single thought, the spirit arises, and the mind aligns effortlessly—**all wishes are fulfilled without delay, in the blink of an eye**.\n\nThe **Celestial Master** received the diagrams and methods, which have five applications, all shared by the **Three Generals**:\n\n1. **For personal cultivation outside**: To prolong life, one visualizes the General and retreats to mountain forests, sacred halls, or Daoist ritual grounds, dispatching malevolent humans and ghosts to guard and protect, ensuring no harm befalls one.\n\n2. **When away from the grounds**: One visualizes the General returning to the ritual site to inspect and repel human and ghostly afflictions.\n\n3. **To repel malevolent and rebellious forces**.\n\n4. **For healing and emergency aid**: By focusing one’s intent, one treats illnesses, cuts off ghostly torment, and achieves immediate resolution—**fulfilling the will in an instant**.\n\n5. **To assist the state and sovereign**: Capturing criminals, rescuing righteous Daoist friends wrongfully harmed.\n\nThese five methods must **not** be recklessly revealed to those without Daoist resolve. Do not speak of them lightly—**misuse brings calamity upon the Nine Ancestors**, not just oneself.\n\nThe **General Zhou’s Stepping Halberd Method** states:\n*\"Without stepping, none may act; all actions must follow the Stepping Halberd’s order.\"* With deep practice over years, one naturally attains communion with spirits and divine responsiveness—**no longer bound by ritual stepping and treading**; a single thought suffices. **Heaven and earth align as its framework; spirits move at its command.**\n\nIn ancient times, **Yu the Great’s sister, the Flying Immortal**,—*[Note: Some texts name her]*—\nwitnessed her brother practice the Stepping Halberd and learned it herself. **After one year, her minor ailments vanished.** *[Note: Some texts say all diseases were cured. This is the original text’s definitive account from the Great Immortal of the Cavern.]*\n**After two years, her body grew light.**\n**After three years, she entered the military to repel armies.**\n\nThe **Fourth Year**, she was enrolled in the **Celestial Register of Immortals**.\nThe **Fifth Year**, she attained **spirit communion**.\nThe **Sixth Year**, her **Dao/Way arts were perfected**.\nThe **Seventh Year**, she could **become invisible**.\nThe **Eighth Year**, she **walked upon water**.\nThe **Ninth Year**, she ascended to the **Pure Court of the Middle**, ennobled as **Lady Saint Immortal**, akin to the rank of **Immortal Official**.\n\nAll these follow this diagram—its method is most wondrous.\nThe **secret lies in binding the third knuckle of the left middle finger** with five-colored silk.\nWhen done, **attach it to the garment**, and visualize **General Zhou** as per the diagram, to command **soldiers, officers, lions, and fierce flames** to burn the dwellings of malevolent ghosts and bandits.\n**In all matters, visualize as per the diagram**—this ensures divine efficacy.\n\n**Visualize General Ge’s method**:\nThe **Celestial Master** said: *\"This General is the Right Division General—why is he ranked second?\"*\n**Laozi, the Venerable Celestial Sovereign**, spoke: *\"Because General Zhou is the Forefront General, belonging to Yang, aligning with the Yang sequence—thus, he is first in the Yang order. If aligned with Yin sequence, he is second, fulfilling the principle of paired numbers.\"*\n\nGeneral **Tang** resides to the left, also belonging to Yang sequence—thus, he is third.\n*[Note: According to the Master’s tradition, one first visualizes General Tang, then General Ge, then General Zhou. Now, ranking General Zhou first signifies the supremacy of the heart-mind. Hence, in the lane, he is first, corresponding to the image of the **Upper Primordial Spirit General**, the Human Spirit General. If used, General Tang must be placed foremost—this is the verified method of the Pine Invocation.]*\n\nAgain, referring to the *Three Primordial Elbow-Post Divine Book*, it states:\n*\"General Tang is first, belonging to the Upper Primordial.\nNext is General Ge, second, belonging to Yin sequence and the Middle Primordial.\nThen General Zhou, third, belonging to the Lower Primordial.*\nWhy do these two accounts differ?\"*\n\nThe *Secret Record of the Highest Venerable Lord Lao* (*Gunzhongji*) states:\n\n*\"If one does not employ magical techniques, one relies instead upon the Three Primordial [Daoist] methods. General Tang is then placed above, as first, proceeding in accordance with the natural sequence of Heavenly Dao/Way and numbers. If one practices and utilizes all methods—rewarding the virtuous and punishing the wicked, acting throughout the world, and summoning ghosts and spirits—then General Zhou is first, residing within the heart and belonging to the Lower Primordial. This is for the sake of humanity, and it is also the Lower Primordial’s central method. Thus, General Zhou is placed foremost, acting contrary to Heaven’s Dao/Way, assaulting malevolent rebels, and conferring rewards upon the virtuous, enabling one to follow the *Liuzhu* [method] with certainty and efficacy.\n\nIf one adheres to the principles of Yin-Yang, the *Divine Physician’s Godly and Immortal Prescriptions of the Highest Unity* (*Taiyi Taiyi Shenxian Fang*) states: 'The left represents the **kidney** (*shèn*), the right represents the **Gate of Life** (*mìngmén*).' One may then follow this directive accordingly.\n\nMoreover, General Tang governs the left kidney, while General Ge commands the male **Gate of Life** (*mìngmén*). Thus, when employing the *Bùgāng* [method] to invoke the generals, they are positioned as the second. Each leads three hundred million soldiers to guard the Gate of Life, with the **Western Guardians** (*Xīfāng Wèichén*) following behind to protect the **Mysterious Body** (*Xuànshēn*). When deploying from the right, one follows the *Bùgāng* [method] as illustrated [in the diagram]. When advancing with the diagram’s soldiers—*Bùgāng*—one invokes them as shown in the talismanic gestures. There is no failure in this.\n\n**Bùgāng** [method].\n*[Note: The **General Ge’s Step** (*Bùgāng*) is performed with the right foot first, symbolizing Yin. This is the standard procedure at the outset; do not deviate from it. This method differs from those of Generals Zhou and Tang.]*\n\nLater, the **Sage Emperor** (*Hòushèng Jūn*) instructed **Zhang the Celestial Master** (*Tiānshī Zhāng*): 'Perform the **Bùgāng** [method], then swallow the talismans, and afterward practice the **Bùgāng** [method] again. There are three talismans—Upper, Middle, and Lower.'\n\nThe **Highest Venerable** (*Tàishàng*) commanded **Mìngwén Lìng**: 'First perform the **Three Primordial Bùgāng** [method], then invoke the talismans and dispatch them accordingly.'\n\nIn ancient times, there was a Daoist named **Liu Gen** (*Liú Gēn*), who habitually practiced the **Three Primordial Step** (*sān yuán bù*). Later, it was transformed into the **Nine Progression Step** (*jiǔ jì yǔbù*). After three years of such practice, all spirits and ghosts revered him and obeyed his commands, and his power could move mountains and rivers.\n\nOne day, he was pursued by an **Idiom: County Magistrate** (*Jùnzhǔ*—*Note: County Magistrate, an ancient title for a prefectural governor*), who sought to harm him. The magistrate ordered him to appear before a ghost by day, threatening that if he refused, he would become a ghost himself. Gen was enraged; he performed the **Bùgāng** [method] in the center of the hall, borrowing the magistrate’s official seal as a talismanic token. With the talisman in hand, he invoked the **Arcade Star** (*Yùxīng*) to mark the magistrate’s native county, villages, ancestral temples, and the graves of his deceased parents and grandparents. He first summoned and bound the magistrate’s departed father and mother, sending them through the southern gate to be hung on the wall. The magistrate saw them, descended from his bed, and knelt in welcome.\n\nGen cursed the magistrate: 'I was born from your body, yet you, as an official, do not honor your parents. You should bring blessings to your deceased ancestors, but instead you dare to provoke the Daoist officers, ordering them to pursue and capture me here? Your life is in peril—quickly kneel and beg the Daoist officers for mercy, and I shall release you. If you do not, you will die instantly.' The magistrate repeatedly knelt and apologized to Gen, who then said: 'Go.' In a moment, both the magistrate and Gen vanished. This is the efficacy of the **Three Primordial Step** (*sān yuán bù*) of the generals.\"\n\nThe talisman is also bound within the middle joint of the left hand’s middle finger, all these being tied with five-colored threads for one year by those who are beginners in the Dao.\n\n**Gen** instructed **Tang General** (Fǎtú) to say: *\"The Old Lord told **Luo** (Lüo) the Daoist Master: 'The scripture commands Gen to summon the Three Generals, with Tang General as the first, presiding over the Upper Primordial (*shàng yuán*). These are all used in ordinary Daoist cultivation, and one must follow the Upper Primordial as the priority.\n\nIf there are urgent difficulties or matters of the heart, then the talisman is used to strike and subdue them. First, one must arouse the mind, then **Zhou General** (*Zhōu Jiāngjūn*) is summoned to first awaken the Lower Primordial (*xià yuán*).\n\nI have heard the Celestial Venerable (*Tiānzūn*) say: 'Cultivation of auspicious and benevolent Dao begins with the Upper Primordial;\nRescuing and healing the sick arises from the Middle Primordial;\nStriking down the wicked and rebellious originates from the Lower Primordial.'\n\nThe *Golden Locks, Flowing Pearls* (*Jīnsuǒ Liúzhū*) scripture was originally established by the Celestial Venerable, the Most High, and others, all to obstruct **heavenly demons** (*Tiān mó*), **human spirits** (*rénshén*), and **dragon ghosts** (*lóngguǐ*) from hindering Daoists in their cultivation and attainment of the Dao. Thus, the *Flowing Pearls* scripture was set forth in one hundred fifty volumes, divided into the Three Primordials. Each Primordial has fifty volumes. The number five governs the Five Phases (*wǔxíng*).*\n\n**Annotation:** *\"In the past, the Celestial Venerable instructed the Most High Dao Lord: 'Each Primordial has fifty volumes, and each Primordial governs the Five Phases—the numbers of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. Thus, those who study the Dao, when practicing with the Flowing Pearls scripture, can transcend the Five Phases, dispel a hundred evils, harmonize with spirits, benefit the realm above (the state), protect the body in the middle (oneself), and safeguard the family below. With sincere resolve, there is no attainment they cannot achieve.'*\n\nI am the Most High Dao Lord (*Tàishàng Lǎojūn*).\"\n\nThe text is condensed and refined into ninety-one volumes,\nso that beginners may find it easy to practice and swiftly grasp its principles—\nall who attain the Dao and become immortals shall employ its Five Transformations.\n\nNow, when the Highest Primordial General Tang is commanded to strike the malevolent spirits of the Western Quarter,\nhe first advances with the *Yǔbù* step of the Southern Quarter,\nfor the Highest Primordial General’s origin lies in the left kidney of man—\nthe left kidney corresponds to Wood.\nAdvancing first through Wood, he enters Fire,\nthen Fire enters Metal,\nthus subduing and conquering the calamities of that person’s spirit-dragon and malevolent ghosts.\n\n**Annotation:** *Here, \"malefactor\" (贼) refers to humans, while \"spirit\" (祟) refers to ghosts.*\nThus, the steps align with intent and speech,\ndissolving and eliminating calamities so they never arise.\n\nIf the Highest Primordial General Tang is instead commanded to strike the malevolent spirits of the Northern Quarter,\n**Annotation:** *Here, \"spirit\" (鬼祟) refers to ghosts, while \"malefactor\" (贼) refers to humans acting as malefactors,*\nhe first advances through the Eastern Quarter,\nentering the Central Palace of Earth,\nand thus strikes the Northern Quarter’s malevolent and vicious calamities—\nthe calamities dissolve of their own accord when spoken.\n\nIf malevolent spirits from the Southern Fire Quarter attack,\none advances through the Eastern Quarter,\nentering the Northern Water Quarter,\nthen turns back to strike the Southern Quarter—\nall such actions will align with intent and speech,\ndissolving and annihilating the malevolent forces without fail.\nThis applies equally to the Central Quarter and the Four Seasons.\n\n**Annotation:** *The Four Seasons (四季) here refers to the Heavenly Stems (上), specifically the combinations of 辰戌丑未.*\nShould malevolent spirits appear,\nthey will always come from the East.\nStrike them directly, and they will be eliminated—\nwithout fail, all will proceed as desired.\n\nThis method is not merely for deploying the General of Tang alone, nor for the joint assault of Generals Ge and Zhou. This teaching only discusses the sequential deployment of troops for striking and assaulting—it is not limited to a single army but encompasses all three armies.\n\nWhen finished, the Five Virtue Generals further assist in striking down Heavenly Demons. The matter is not trivial; one must sincerely uphold righteousness in heart and practice the Great Dao without flaw, thus achieving harmony of speech and intent.\n\nThe **Step of the Halter** commands the Three Generals of Dao Officials and Soldiers to lead first. When facing a great battle against enemy spirits and demons, all nine generals must be deployed—not just the three of Zhongyuan. Both Shangyuan and Xiayuan must also send their aides, as in *Han Hongtu*.\n\nGenerally, the three Zhongyuan Generals lead the charge, striking and assaulting first. This is a formidable force, capable of rescuing urgent crises, suppressing false deities and spirits causing havoc, regulating the Five Viscera, and eliminating evil while promoting goodness—without favor or bias. They are the fierce and righteous divine generals of the Dao.\n\nLater sages further refined *The Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl*, removing cumbersome passages and compiling it into fifteen volumes, along with thirty additional volumes of corrected prefaces, guiding disciples into the Daoist path of the Flowing Pearl and making the way easier for later seekers.\n\nGranted to Zhang Daoling, it clearly explains the use of the Flowing Pearl’s methods, also treasured in later scriptures. It must not be recklessly transmitted by mortals. The Celestial Master instructed King Jun in the Zhongyuan Upper Halter Step, which also includes the **Ding Halter Step** and the **Yǔ Step**—sometimes as the **Proper Halter**, sometimes as the **Ding Step**.\n\n*The Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl Canon* states that the two aides take fifty-five steps in the Halter, always deploying the General of Tang first, commanding three hundred million soldiers. With the left hand holding the golden talisman and the right hand wielding the bow’s sinew-shaking force, he seizes the fierce and malevolent demons and bandits with overwhelming might. The soldiers and officials then demolish the lairs of the malevolent ghosts and demons.\n\nTurning to face the Zhongyuan and Xiayuan Generals, he orders them to unite in purpose, swiftly converging upon the lair of the malevolent demon or bandit. Each exhales natural heavenly fire, burning the lair of the malevolent demon or bandit. There are also natural lions that devour the spirits and souls of the malevolent demons and bandits, preventing them from causing harm to humans or ourselves.\n\nThe General of Tang is then summoned, and immediately three hundred million officials and soldiers arrive, aligning their hearts with the two generals. Together, they encircle the distant encampments, temples, and dwellings of the malevolent demons and bandits.\n\nThe second-in-command to the General of Tang is General Ge, seventy-two *zhang* in height, wielding a spear in his right hand and a fist-shaking bow in his left. His sinew-shaking force is mighty and fierce, capable of shattering mountains. He arrives united in purpose with the General of Tang, attacking the malevolent demons and bandits in their dwellings and bodies. He also exhales natural heavenly fire, alongside lions, great serpents, and iron-clad soldiers marked with *seban* texts—fierce, poisonous, and savage. Wielding swords, they enter the lairs of the malevolent demons and bandits, exterminating each one without escape.\n\nThe lions and poisonous serpents also bite and devour the demons and bandits.\n\nThe third-in-command, General Zhou, governs the mind and spirit. Thus, *The Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl* records him as the first in command, mastering the expansive Dao and commanding the spirits. *(Annotation: This is the Celestial Master’s proclamation to the Twenty-Four Great True Persons of Xuanzhou, instructing them in the practice of stepping along the celestial and terrestrial Halter, each attaining true immortality. Through the heart’s command of the generals and soldiers, their merit accumulates, reaching three thousandfold, and through deep cultivation, they attain the Dao—all governed by the mind, hence the emphasis on the first.)*\n\nThis is for exorcising demons. According to the later sages’ instructions to Zhang Tian Shi and King Jun, General Zhou should lead the vanguard or rearguard and must not be exclusively ranked first.\n\nIf one seeks the Dao for longevity, the General of Tang should lead as first. If one seeks to cure illnesses or capture malevolent forces, General Zhou should lead as first, and success will follow. If one masters the Great Dao, the General of Tang should lead as first.\n\nGeneral Zhou, with his left hand holding the scepter and his right hand wielding the sinew-shaking bow force, arrives to seize and drive away the malevolent demons and bandits, following behind. This clarifies that he is the third in the General of Tang’s formation, as explained in the scriptures and prefaces.\n\nThe current interpretation follows the *Flowing Pearl* text as primary, governed by the heart’s intent and used in sequence. *(Annotation: This addition is from Zhao’s commentary, not the Celestial Master’s original Golden-Mouthed teachings.)*\n\nThe Celestial Master told King Jun: The Three Elements govern the Four Seasons—*(Annotation: Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter are the Four Seasons, corresponding to the divine entry into Taiyi, Lei Gong, and Liu Ren’s methods.)*—the Four Seasons *(Annotation: The gods of Heaven)* govern the Five Phases, the Five Phases govern the Six Jia, the Six Jia govern the Seven Stars, the Seven Stars govern the Eight Directions—*(Annotation: The Eight Directions in Heaven, the Eight Trigrams on Earth—Qian, Kun, Xun, Zhen, Kan, Gen, Dui, and Xian—all centered in the Middle Palace, invoking the Nine Palaces.)*—the Eight Directions govern the Nine Palaces, and the Nine Palaces generate the Ten Celestial Stems—*(Annotation: The current Ten Stems.)*—the Ten Stems generate the Twelve Earthly Branches, all arising from the natural *qi* of the Great Dao. When called upon, they respond and assist.\n\nWith a single-minded and refined intent, one attains profound understanding, securing the protection of the Three Elements and Five Phases. Through persistent cultivation, one achieves the Dao of longevity and eternal youth.\n\nI once transmitted this teaching to Shennong, who only understood the Three Elements but not the Six Jia. Though he lived over a hundred years without signs of aging, he later attained the method of *shīxiè* (corporeal ascension).\n\n---\n\nThe Dao of the Six Jia is known to me; one who can guard the spirit and regulate the body attains communion with the Three Elements. The Three Elements, when harnessed, can guard and save humanity. Regulating the body leads to communion with the True, and seizing the True of the Seven Stars grants mastery over ghosts and communion with spirits, establishing control over malevolent *qi*.\n\nThrough prolonged cultivation—*(Note: \"修\" refers to the method of measured steps and attuned clothing; \"求\" denotes the ritual techniques of exorcism, invocation, and talismans.)*—the immortal method is secured. The Daoist adept, Madame Fan, would, on the day of her birth, often perform exorcism rituals. Ten years later, the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper descended, teaching her the method of measured steps. Upon completion, she ascended in broad daylight. Only her old wedding garments remained, and the villagers buried them; to this day, people speak of the tomb of Fan and Liu’s ancient garments.\n\nThus, one attains longevity. All must first pass through the Three Elements and then the Seven Stars, relying upon them to begin practice. Knowing this, one becomes a Daoist adept.\n\nKeep it secret; do not recklessly impart it to others.\n\nTherefore, I begin with One, establish Two, command Three, harmonize Four, transform Five, don Five, command Six, point to Seven, and preserve Nine—the method of attaining immortality.\n\nI teach the Dao of entering the True and communing with the spirit, all achieved through the Three Elements Generals. The initial method is One: the *yuanqi* (original *qi*), the elder spirit within the body, thus named *yuanqi*, as One. *(Note: The spirit within the body is the \"神,\" residing in the *nìwán* (brain marrow). The \"太一\" is also this.)*\n\nOne has two categories: the first, external to the body, is Heaven—the spirit of the *Taiyi*. One can command the second, which is the Earth spirit. *(Note: The Earth spirit within the body is the spirit of the kidneys and spleen, also called the Dragon God’s commander, the *Dìzhuì*.)*\n\nThe second category, within the body, is the heart—the spirit of *Zhèngyī* (Upright One) can command the second, which is the spirit of the kidneys and spleen. Adding the left and right kidneys *(Note: Left kidney for men, right for women.)*—this is Three.\n\nThe method states: Two can command Three—namely, the Generals Tang, Ge, and Zhou. Three can subdue a hundred spirits, heal a hundred ailments, disperse a thousand calamities, and eliminate ten thousand poisons. *(Note: Poisons and malevolent afflictions of this kind.)*\n\nAll these methods are supreme; they are the workings of One *qi*.\n\nThe method of One begins with the principle of the first step, the \"One\" character, which governs the heart. *(Note: \"One\" refers to *yuanqi* (original *qi*), the brain spirit *Taiyi*, which enters the body and governs the heart.)*\n\nThe later sage-king said to Lord Wang: \"One spirit enters the Five Phases—this is the way. When the heart generates a thought, it is the principle of the method’s discipline and order. Once discipline and order are established, the hundred spirits respond, and nothing fails to succeed.\n\nBut if one speaks from the heart, invoking blessings or curses, the consequences of fortune or misfortune, guilt or virtue, arise with a single thought. The ancients honored One, keeping it undisturbed. Sit upon Two, making it inactive. Invest in Three, so that ten thousand soldiers guard my longevity, and no evil may act.\n\nThe heart commands all spirits; the Three Elements are the leaders, and the Six Jia are the assistants. One can command them. *(Note: Commanding and using them means guiding them to follow the Dao, without harming people or things; this is to make them beneficial, ensuring good deeds take root. Using them to harm is the accumulation of evil karmic deeds, which must not be done recklessly.)*\n\nOne can command and establish communion with the spirits, thereby achieving longevity. Three circuits complete, and then the discipline of the steps begins.\n\nLaozi said: \"If one wishes to command the Three Elements Generals, first preserve the spirits of *Taiyi*, *Tiānyī* (Heavenly One), and *Xīnyī* (Heart One). Then step the discipline of *Taiyi* and *Xīnyī*, attune the clothing, and issue the command according to the method, as if commanding soldiers.\n\nThe later sage-king told Zhang Daoling: 'You wish to seek longevity; you must practice the steps of *Taiyi*.' *(Note: The discipline of *Taiyi*.)* 'To attain immortality, preserve and enter the steps of *Tiānyī*.' *(Note: *Tiānyī* refers to the Upright One’s Three-Five steps of discipline, the method of preserving the spirit and measured steps.)* 'To swiftly ascend as an immortal, the *Xīnyī* must first arise, surpassing all other methods.' *(Note: When *Xīnyī* is preserved, it is within the body, arising from the heart.)*\n\n---\n\nFor those who cultivate the Supreme Dao, the heart must first generate a thought before all the Ones. The heart reigns over the body; once one knows the heart is the sovereign of cultivation, one practices the correct method before *Taiyi*, attaining the nature of *Zhèngyī*, and together with *Xīnyī*, they govern all immortals.\n\nThe heart must always be steadfast in the Three Ones, never losing the body, and thus attains the Dao of immortality.\n\nAgain, he told the Young Lord of the Eastern Sea: \"On the day of your birth, practice the steps of *Xīnyī*; on the *jiǎzǐ* day of Upper Element, practice the steps of *Taiyi*; on the *jiǎzǐ* day of Middle Element, and on the *jiǎzǐ* day of Lower Element, practice the steps of *Zhèngyī*. Often do this, and in nine years, the Dao of immortality will be complete; the Three Ones will be fulfilled.\n\nAgain, he told the Old Woman of the Western Mountain: *(Note: Some say this is the Fragrant Maiden.)* \"Practice the method of the Three Elements Generals: use General Tang as the leader during the *yín* hour, use General Ge as the leader during the *wǔ* hour and its aftermath, and use General Zhou as the leader during the *shēn* hour and beyond.\"\n\n「This Old Woman performs this practice every five days, and after seven years, she reverses her aging, becoming a youthful maiden of about thirty. After ten years, the Dao is complete, and she appears as a woman of eighteen in form and visage.\n\nThe Celestial Master told the Yellow Emperor—*(Note: At this time, the Celestial Master was Broad Success Child, or else the Peerless Sage, or during the time of Yao and Shun, he was the Attendant of the Numinous.)*—\"The Three Elements Generals' method: the Upper Element has its own three divisions—Upper, Middle, and Lower. The Upper Division is led by General Tang. The Middle Division is led by General Li. The Lower Division is led by General Zhou.\n\nHe said: 'The Three Elements Generals oversee the Five *Dé* and manifest the Five Phases. Knowing this Dao, one may learn longevity.' The Emperor thus studied it.\n\nThe Celestial Master taught the Emperor the method of the Upper Element's *Taiyi* steps, beginning with the *jiǎzǐ* day of Upper Element. Next, he took the *jiǎzǐ* day of Middle Element. Then, he took the *jiǎzǐ* day of Lower Element. The Upper Element steps of *Taiyi*, the Middle Element steps of *Zhèngyī*, and the Lower Element steps of *Xīnyī*.\n\nThe Upper Element's *Taiyi* General Tang leads the celestial officials and bureaucrats, all governed by this divine general, corresponding to the Upper Division's General Tang of Upper Element. Aspirants of the Dao earnestly seek to know this.\n\nThe Middle Element's *Taiyi* General—*(Note: *Taiyi* refers to the *Zhèngyī* Alliance's ritual steps, which must be practiced with due reverence to avoid harming the body. One begins by advancing the left foot first.)*—leads the earthly mandates, the Five Sacred Mountains and Four Seas, as well as the spirits of the Northern Du Capital, overseeing the netherworld's affairs. This corresponds to the Upper Element's Middle Division General Li. Those who practice the Dao but do not know this are recorded by the Northern Netherworld.\n\nIf one knows and practices it often, the Three Generals' assaults are invoked, all led by General Ge.\n\nThe Lower Element's *Xīnyī* General leads the Water Palaces, the Northern expanse of the Primordial Wastes, the Four Seas and Nine Rivers, the myriad streams and lakes, and all the spirits of their sources. He governs and invokes them to strike and subdue, all under General Zhou's command. This aligns with the Lower Division's General Xu of Upper Element.\n\nTo practice *Tiānyī*—*(Note: *Tiānyī*, these are the ritual steps of the *Zhèngyī* Alliance's威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威\n\n---\n\n**Note:** *Xiaoziji* is a female immortal.\n\nIt is said: The **One Dipper** (*Yīdǒu*) completion is the **Kui Star**’s envoy. First, walk the **Earthly Measure** (*Dìjì*) and the **Celestial Dipper’s Ropes** (*Tiāngāng*), until the sequence reaches the **Three Generals’ Ropes**. When the **Three Ropes** are complete, then store the **Dipper’s Envoys** to strike and subdue. The scripture states: *\"First walk, then summon the North Dipper’s Seven Stars to seize and kill\"*—this is the **First Completion**.\n\nThen turn the fingers to point at objects, but do not yet rely on the mouth. One must practice diligently and grow thoroughly familiar through prolonged study.\n\nWhen the two methods yield results, the North Dipper follows, and whatever the mouth desires in intent, the fingers shall verify.\n\nThe **One Dipper** has its own diagram; store and visualize it for completion.\n\nWhen visualization is complete, recite the invocation:\n\n> *\"One Dipper complete, Three Five united,*\n> *Heaven reversed, Earth overturned,*\n> *Follow my commands as envoys.*\n> *As it is, so it shall be done—just as the law decrees.\"*\n\nThe **Two Dippers** completion is the envoy of the **□ Star**. Also, store the **One Dipper** completion, then proceed to the **Two Dippers** completion.\n\nWhen the envoys are stored within the body, the practice succeeds and one attains communion with spirits. The body can then awe and subdue objects, safeguard life, rescue and gather the lost, and achieve anything desired—this is called the **Two Stars’ Envoys’ Awe**.\n\nThe **Two Dippers** also have their own diagram; store and visualize it for completion, and it shall manifest.\n\nRecite the invocation:\n\n> *\"Two Dippers complete, Three Five enlightened,*\n> *Gather and subdue malevolent spirits,*\n> *Wickedness and evil shall submit in fear.*\n> *As it is, so it shall be done—just as the law decrees.\"*\n\nThe **Three Dippers** completion is the envoy of the **□ Star**. Also, store the **Two Dippers** completion, then proceed to the **Three Dippers** completion.\n\nWhen the envoys are stored within the body, its spiritual power gradually grows awe-inspiring. The **Three Manifestations** (*Sānyào*) radiate like light, and the form of the Dipper blazes upon the body. The **Three Dippers** also have their own diagram; store and visualize it for completion, and the envoys shall manifest in effect.\n\nRecite the invocation:\n\n> *\"Three Dippers complete,*\n> *Heaven and Earth purified,*\n> *The Dipper follows my body,*\n> *Those who see it shall flee in terror.*\n> *As it is, so it shall be done—just as the law decrees.\"*\n\nThe **Four Dippers** completion is the envoy of the **□ Star**. Also, store the **Three Dippers** completion, then proceed to the **Four Dippers** completion.\n\nWhen the envoys are summoned, the practitioner blazes with fire encircling the **Four Dippers**, assuming the Dipper’s form. Malevolent spirits and wickedness shall tremble, their hearts crushed and subjugated.\n\nThe **Four Dippers** also have their own diagram; store and visualize it for completion, and the envoys shall manifest in effect.\n\nRecite the invocation:\n\n> *\"Four Dippers complete,*\n> *Three Five full,*\n> *Traverse ten thousand miles,*\n> *Wind and fire shall not cease,*\n> *Slay and annihilate malevolent spirits,*\n> *Wickedness and evil dare not act.*\n> *As it is, so it shall be done—just as the law decrees.\"*\n\nThe **Five Dippers** completion is the envoy of the **□ Star**. Also, store the **Four Dippers** completion, then proceed to the **Five Dippers** completion.\n\nWhen the envoys are summoned, the practitioner’s **refined light** (*Guāngqì*) ascends to Heaven, assuming the Dipper’s form, its radiance illuminating the four quarters. Malevolent spirits and wickedness retreat a hundred miles, a hundred ailments vanish, and demons and malevolent forces are crushed and extinguished.\n\nThe **Five Dippers** also have their own diagram; store and visualize it for completion, and the envoys shall manifest in the Dipper’s form. The true image shines a thousand miles distant, spirits and gods submit in awe.\n\nRecite the invocation:\n\n> *\"Five Dippers complete,*\n> *The Five Phases arrayed,*\n> *The Five Metals rise like autumn clouds,*\n> *The Wooden Spirits are extinguished.*\n> **Note:** *Spirits* refers to the multitude of malevolent ghosts.\n> *The Five Woods flourish in spring, subduing the Earth Star.*\n> *The Five Waters flow and disperse, severing the Fire Phase.*\n> *The Five Fires blaze fiercely, the Five Metals dare not howl.*\n> *The Five Earths are purified and settled,*\n> *I and all things are born together.*\n> *As it is, so it shall be done—just as the law decrees.\"*\n\nThe **Six Dippers** completion is the envoy of the **□ Star**. Also, store the **Five Dippers** completion, then proceed to the **Six Dippers** completion.\n\nWhen the envoys are summoned, the practitioner’s refined light illuminates Heaven and Earth, radiating in the eight directions. Malevolent spirits and wickedness hide and vanish, while the body attains communion with spiritual *qi* (*Língqì*), its nature merging with the True Immortals. A hundred ghosts shall fear and respect, a thousand spirits shall guard and protect.\n\nThe **Six Dippers** also have their own diagram; store and visualize it for completion, and the envoys shall manifest in effect.\n\nRecite the invocation:\n\n> *\"Six Dippers complete,*\n> *Three Five move in concert,*\n> *Eliminate evil and wickedness,*\n> *Purify ten thousand miles.*\n> *I summon the Six Dippers and Six Hexagrams,*\n> *All united to guard my body and home,*\n> *Attaining eternal life.*\n> *As it is, so it shall be done—just as the law decrees.\"*\n\nThe **Seven Dippers** completion is the envoy of the **□ Star**. Also, store the **Six Dippers** completion, then proceed to the **Seven Dippers** completion.\n\nWhen the envoys are summoned, the practitioner encircles the **Seven Stars**, bearing the **Seven Dippers** upon their body, their radiance illuminating the ten directions. The body aligns with the North Dipper, and malevolent spirits are struck with awe. Auspicious omens follow the practitioner, ten thousand miles are purified, and countless guards attend.\n\nThere is also its own diagram; thus, the **Seven Dippers** envoys are fully stored. Now, when the seven stars are established, the envoys manifest instantly, responding at the heart and mouth like lightning illuminating the body. Store the Dipper’s completion power, and the spirits shall endure thus forever. When the envoys are stored, the body ascends to the **Upper Pure** (*Shàngqīng*).\n\nRecite the invocation:\n\n> *\"Seven Dippers complete the body,*\n> *United with the Six Hexagrams,*\n> *Drive and command the Three Elements,*\n> *Reverse and turn the Five Phases,*\n> *Enter the ranks of the immortals,*\n> *Walk with the Supreme Unity,*\n> *Dominate the Nine Heavens,*\n> *Purify the Nine Earths,*\n> *May my household all become immortals,*\n> *Every dwelling share in eternal life.*\n> *As it is, so it shall be done—just as the law decrees.\"*\n\n**Laozi** says: *\"The essence of the Six Hexagrams transforms into the Seven Stars.\"* The Seven Stars shift and move, overseeing and inspecting all spiritual beings.\n\n**Note:** *Spiritual beings* refers to humans, gods, dragons, beasts, spirits, and ghosts, etc. Those within Heaven and Earth who are born with spiritual vitality and divine communion are called *spiritual beings*.\n\nAll spiritual beings fear the North Dipper’s Seven Stars. Thus, those who study the Dao all know of the North Dipper’s Seven Stars and habitually store and contemplate them, donning them like garments. Though garments differ in quality, length, and style, they uniformly cover the body without fail.\n\nIf one desires that all spiritual beings fear and respect, and to secure one’s own longevity, then with the **One Dipper** to **Six Dippers** according to merit, the depth and magnitude of their efficacy shall not falter by a single measure.\n\nFor those who are beginners, they must diligently cultivate day and night, memorizing this method and storing it in thought. Do not lose the names of the stars, and always keep them firmly in mind.\n\nThe Dao does not depart from the heart, nor does the heart need to depart from the Dao.\nWhen the two are inseparable, divine efficacy is established, and immortality is attained.\n\n**The Sixth and Seventh Scrolls of *Jin Suo Liu Zhu* (Golden Lock Flowing Pearl)**\n\nComposed by the Great True Ones of Zhonghua:\nZai Wang Fang Ping, Zhang Daoling, Zhao Sheng, Wang Chang, Si Ming, Li Zhongfu, Mao Ying, Xu Yu Fu, and others of successive generations.\nCommentary by the Daoist Immortal Li Chunfeng.\n\n**Explanation of the Upper Section: *Zhuan Shen Cun Yong Tu* (Diagram of Transforming the Body and Storing Its Use)**\n\nAll Daoist practitioners who diligently cultivate with earnest devotion—reciting scriptures, chanting the True, offering morning and evening incense, whether three times a day, six times a day, or twice a day—\nyet after ten years, twenty years, thirty years, or even their entire life, gain nothing, only to perish from old age or disease.\n\nSome abandon food and dwell in mountains, burning elixirs and refining medicines for years without divine response—what then can they rely upon?\nSuch disciples perish in great numbers.\n\nIf one does not grasp the true path, what foundation can they have?\nThose who rely solely on fasting, purity, and abandoning wife and child—whether Daoists or Buddhists—are even more numerous, yet none have prolonged life or extended their years, let alone ascended as dragons and phoenixes to become True Persons.\n\nNow, the Buddhist scriptures say:\n*\"What one cultivates in this life will be received in the next\"*—this is false.\n**Note:** The Buddhist scriptures claim, *\"What one cultivates in this life will be received in the next,\"* but this is incorrect.\n\nOur Great Dao does not even permit such thoughts. If kings and ministers seek to preserve their bodies eternally, why would they abandon the pride and wealth of this life to seek rewards in the next?\nThese words are utterly baseless and unworthy of trust.\n\nOne must seek the gate of the Supreme Dao and grasp its essential practice—realizing it in this life, becoming the Dao’s sovereign and minister. How could this not perfect body and heart?\nThe Dao is here, in this life. Body and heart must be cultivated together, attaining an indestructible form—how wondrous is this?\n\nThis is the explanation of cause and effect.\n**Note:** The Buddhist scriptures often speak of cause and effect, yet ignorant people—especially foolish women—are deceived into believing in karmic retribution and induced to make empty offerings. This is wrong.\n\nThe enlightened follow the Dao naturally, as heaven nurtures and earth sustains.\nSince heaven nurtures and earth sustains, water and fire first form the body, and when the body matures into humanity, it is again water and fire that bring about old age and death.\nThus, the origin of birth and death lies within the Three Realms, all governed by natural law, not by cultivation of seeds.\n**Note:** The Buddhist scriptures emphasize the cultivation of seeds, ignoring the teaching of natural law.\n\nYet true alignment with body and heart lies within the Dao. The seed of the Dao and its blessings reside in body and heart itself.\nAll internal cultivation is complete—external seeds are irrelevant.\n**Note:** True Persons cultivate body and heart, not earthen structures or temples.\nTrue Persons refine body and heart, not metals and stones.\nAll is governed by the natural teaching of the Dao.\n\nThus, the Supreme True Ones employ methods and incantations that never leave the body, yet their influence permeates heaven and earth.\n**Note:** This rejects the notion of grand diagrams.\n\nLater, the Sage Emperor instructed the young daughter of Xi Wangmu:\n*\"Though you were young and read little, you will serve others well when grown.\"*\nAfter several years, she saw someone reading the *Lao Jun Jing* and began learning the characters.\nOnce she recognized the script, she asked: *\"Do you know the names of the gods within the body?\"*\nHearing this, she was taught the method of *Zhuan Shen You Si Jie Xin Yin* (Transforming the Body, Silent Contemplation, and Sealing the Heart’s Seal).\n**Note:** This is the inner method of the *Liu Zhu* (Flowing Pearl).\n\nLater, with great spiritual power, she taught Xi Wangmu in return.\n**Note:** Initially, Xi Wangmu could only prolong life, ride dragons across heaven and earth, and summon them at will—but she could not herself master dragons, cranes, lions, or tigers.\nNow, by invoking clouds and dragons in thought, and summoning armies unseen, mother and daughter both attained it, and she is now called the Immortal King.\n\nAgain, she passed this down to the Heavenly Master, commanding him to refine his thoughts and combine the method of summoning.\nWhen the method was perfected, he became the central teacher of the Orthodox Dao, a celestial official akin to a great prefect, his status unassailable.\nHe must meditate once every hundred days.\n**Note:** To inspect and suppress malevolent spirits, ghosts, and evil *jing* (precise entities) that harm humanity.\n\nHe must store and apply the method once every ten days.\n**Note:** *\"Apply\"* means to contemplate and store the method, observing the world for malevolent *jing*, evil spirits, dragons, and ghosts that might harm humanity—or for poisonous *qi* disrupting humanity and the cosmos.\nHe must also fear that the sun and moon may dim, stars may cease their courses, winds and rains may fail, and spirits may deceive people.\nThese are the first concerns.\n\nThe second concern is self-cultivation: keeping the Three Souls and Seven Spirits aligned, ensuring *qi* flows correctly, and distinguishing essence and spirit—thus attaining longevity.\nLife is as depicted in the diagram: the sun and moon are clear, the stars shine within.\n**Note:** Store the Seven Stars so they enter and govern the five viscera, guarding the body’s spirits.\n\nOne may also assume the form of the Dao Father as depicted in the diagram—\nwhether in battle, in the wilderness, or in a grand sealed retreat—\nholding one’s breath, stepping in the Twelve Paces of Yu.\n**Note:** The Twelve Paces of Yu, four steps in twelve paces, correspond to the Twelve Branches and the Twelve Months. The Supreme Lord Lao transmitted this to Yu, who passed it to the world, calling it the *Yu Bu* (Yu’s Steps).\n\nWith the left hand, hold the Dao Father.\n**Note:** *\"Father\"* refers to the Yang. Men should use the left hand to grasp *Hu Qi* (Sudden Breath), and upon completion, contemplate it as a figure—\nwearing a lotus-crowned headdress, clad in purple robes—\ngradually rising until it stands before the heart, as if part of oneself.\n\nStore its height as one’s own: nine *zhang* tall, in purple robes, surrounded by soldiers bearing spears and halberds—\nthe Azure Dragon to the left, the White Tiger to the right, the Black Tortoise and Vermilion Bird arrayed in the five clouds.\n\nThen, with the right hand, trace:\nthe Ghost’s Eye,\nthe Spirit’s Eye,\nthe Tiger’s and Wolf’s Eyes,\nand the Evil Man’s Knife-Supporting Eye,\nmarking them all in red.\n\n「With both hands clasped before the heart, strike the teeth thirty-six times, then open the eyes and recite the invocation.\n\nStore the self as the **Examiner-Invoker** (考召法师)—\n**Note:** This is the modern term for the **Examiner-Invoker** when petitioned in official documents.\nIn ancient times, the Dao Father (太上老君) served as **Yu You Zi** (务犹子) during the reigns of Yao and Shun.\nAfter two hundred and fifty years in the Western Realm (西国), he internally transformed the **Illuminated King** (明王) **Dali** (达利) into a Buddha (佛), and appointed **Wuji Zi** (无极子) as the **Examiner-Invoker** (考召法师).\nThat one was called **Guanyin** (观音), who attends to the sufferings and diseases of all beings,\nso that none perish prematurely or are harmed by calamity (夭伤).\nThe soldiers and generals are arrayed on both sides as per the diagram.\n**Note:** The diagram appears in the *Jin Suo Liu Zhu Jing* (金锁流珠经).\n\nAccording to the method, traverse the world (世界), and from the mouth emit great winds and clouds (大风云),\nfilling all of heaven and earth—\nthis is the mandate of the Dao (行道之命).\nRecite the incantation (捻诀咒) thus:\n\n*\"Heaven is luminous, Earth is responsive.\nI am the Examiner-Invoker, born before Heaven and Earth.\nI traverse as Heaven and Earth’s envoy, standing as their soldiers.\nMisfortune and calamity meet their own destruction, virtue and power appear of their own accord.\nNot only do I restrain the Tiger and Wolf (虎狼),\nbut I also command the Five Armies (五兵).\nDivine Dragons dare not act divine, demons dare not act responsive.\nI point to mountains, and mountains collapse;\nI point to waters, and waters dry up.\nI point to stones, and stones roll away;\nI point to the sun, and it shines brightly.\nMy body guards me in both movement and rest,\nwith three hundred and sixty thousand soldiers following.\nAt my hand’s command,\nwinds, fires, thunder, and lightning arise immediately.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the **imperative decree** (如律令).\"*\n\nUpon finishing the incantation, trace the **secret formula** (捻诀).\n**Note:** The secret formula is on the first joint of the left hand’s index finger,\ncovering the **Ghost’s Eye** (游鬼目) and the **Five Armies’ Commanding Eye** (都监).\nThe **Ghost’s Eye** is on the first joint of the fourth finger.\n\nThe Dao Father (太上老君) transmitted the **Twelve Manifestations of Yu’s Step** (十二迹禹步) to the Yellow Emperor (黄帝).\n**Note:** This was when **Guang Cheng Zi** (广成子) instructed the Emperor.\nDuring the reigns of Yao and Shun, he passed it to **Yu** (禹),\nand **Yu** then transmitted it to the people of the world.\n\nThe Dao Father said:\n*\"To seek the Dao of longevity (求长生之道),\none must first align the **Step Framework** (步纲) and trace the **secret formula** (捻诀),\nand also master the methods of saving others and subduing ghosts,\ncontrolling divine Dragons, Tigers, and Leopards (神龙虎豹),\nas well as averting plagues and epidemics (瘟毒疫疠).\nWithin the Five Armies (五兵),\none can emerge unscathed alone.\nOne can also restrain them,\nor command them to withdraw from harm.\nThis method is profound and subtle (微妙),\nand cannot be easily heard.\"*\n\nThose who have seen and heard the **Manifestations of the Dao** attain communion with the divine, and the divine protect them as their guardians.\n\nThose who attain this method must first receive instruction from a **Clear Teacher** (明师). Only after being transmitted the **Scriptures, Laws, and Talismans** (经法箓) may they, after three years or two years, then be granted this method’s **secret formula**. This formula is transmitted orally, strictly following prescribed rites and measures. It cannot be hastily passed in batches of three or five volumes at once. Instead, unrelated matters must be discussed, and the transmission day must be broken into three or two separate sessions of oral instruction.\n\nFollowing the **precepts of past and future sages**, one cultivates the **Great Dao’s reverence for the Most Exalted Sovereign**. Knowing not to recklessly divulge the teachings, both master and disciple attain true immortality. How could this not be the master’s restraint in transmission and the disciple’s sincere resolve to receive it?\n\nTo seek the **Supreme Dao**, one must devote heart and soul, bowing in earnest and sincere petition—never casually requesting a teacher and expecting immediate instruction. In this world, ordinary teachers, yielding to human desires, recklessly transmit and lightly divulge the Dao’s methods.\n\n**Note:** In ancient times, great immortals would transmit the Scriptures, Laws, and Talismans, then require three thousand days of cultivation before passing on the essential **secret formulas**. This was to prevent people from forgetting their cultivation, for life is fleeting. Thus, they would petition for instruction and warnings, testing the disciple through three or five matters. Only if their resolve was unshaken, their aspiration for longevity genuine, and their desire to benefit the world sincere—without leaking the teachings to the unworthy—would they grant oral transmission.\n\nOriginally, this method was not recorded in writing, for those who seek the Dao often suffer from forgetfulness, and written records would go unmastered. The **Celestial Tribunals** of the **Three Officials** (三官) and the **Divine Sovereigns of Heaven, Earth, and Water** (天曹上帝道君及后圣君) were informed, lest true immortals and holy masters be disgraced. If the transmission is not passed orally, the disciple will not attain immortality. The blame falls upon the **Three Officials**, who would then harm and kill them. This is not because the unworthy rejected the formula, but because they lacked the path to cultivation, hence failing to become immortals.\n\nThus, the **Ancient Sage Laozi** commanded the **True Person Light Resonance** (光妙音) to compile and practice the **secret formulas**, integrating them into the Dao’s gate. He then structured **Fifteen Volumes** and transmitted them to **Mu Tianzi** and the **Sages**, opening the path to cultivation. In the prosperous era, when the **Later Sage Sovereign** (后圣君) was known, he ordered **Wang Fangping** to compile **Thirty Volumes**, transmitting them to the **Heavenly Hosts** and **Cavernous Heavens**.\n\nAmong those who left the world and received transmission were:\n**Zhang Tian Shi**, **Zhang Chongxu**, **Li Yanni**, **Li Shaojun**, **Li Babai**, **Li Jingyou**, **Li Fazhou**, **Li Changxian**, **Li Zhongfu**, the **three Teach brothers**, **Yuan Shaokang**, **True Yuanzi**, **Wei Zhongkuan**, **Zhu Shaoyang**, **Le Yi**, **Dongfang Shuo**, **Yin Xi**, **Xu Jia**, **Xu Cha**, **Xu Hui**, **Shi Jiazi**, **Jie Xiang**, **Li Buji**, and hundreds more—all who practiced this method and became **True Persons**, passing it down in succession. They compiled **Fifteen Volumes of Dao Lectures**.\n\nFrom the ancient **Pan Gu era** to the present, this method has been compiled and transmitted through successive generations. **The crimes of neglecting this are grave.**\n\n---\n\n**Annotations:**\n黄卢子葛越 (*Huáng Lú Zǐ Gé Yuè*)\n少室山 (*Shàoshì Shān*)\n幽思转身 (*yōusī zhuǎnshēn*)\n告命万神 (*gàomìng wànshén*)\n三魂七魄 (*sānhún qībò*)\n五藏百脉 (*wǔzàng bǎimài*)\n千筋万灵 (*qiānjīn wànlíng*)\n行生布炁 (*xíngshēng bùqì*)\n兴法动禁 (*xīngfǎ dòngjìn*)\n甲子日 (*Jiǎzǐ Rì*)\n六甲日 (*Liùjiǎ Rì*)\n道灵使兵 (*Dàolíng shǐbīng*)\n上清 (*Shàngqīng*)\n玉女 (*Yùnǚ*)\n考召法 (*kǎozhào fǎ*)\n步纲 (*bùgāng*)\n步蹑速频 (*bùniè sùpín*)\n上界天真 (*Shàngjiè Tiānzhēn*)\n金锁流珠引 (*Jīnsuǒ Liúzhū Yǐn*)\n\n---\n\n**Translation:**\n\n**Note:** In ancient times, **Huáng Lú Zǐ Gé Yuè** resided in **Mount Shàoshì**. Suddenly, a devoted seeker of the **Dao** appeared, but he did not meet a master. **Yuè** then suddenly communicated with him, agreeing to take him as a disciple. The seeker returned home, gathered gold and silk, and eagerly sought instruction. **Yuè** warned him, saying, *\"Your haste is a grave offense. The **Dao** first transmits the **fa** of the **luóshu** (scrolls), then imparts the secrets of the **ling** scriptures. You press too urgently—your guilt extends even to me.\"* Thus, he refused to instruct him. The man departed.\n\nLater, a divine being descended to inform **Yuè**, *\"You have mastered the **Dao**-heart profoundly; never reveal it lightly.\"* **Lǎozǐ**, the **Tàishàng**, spoke to **Huángdì**, saying: *\"When the mind is deeply focused and the body transformed, the **Dao**-command reaches all spirits.\"* **Note:** *To command all spirits means to follow the twelve steps of **yōusī zhuǎnshēn**—the pivoting of the body’s framework. This summons the spirits within the body: the **three souls and seven spirits**, the **five viscera and hundred vessels**, the **thousand tendons and myriad subtle essences**, ordering each to its proper station—**Zhèngdìng** and **Wáng**—to circulate **qi** and vitalize **fa**. When the **fa** is activated and prohibitions moved, it harmonizes with the spirits of **Heaven and Earth**, **Yin and Yang**, the **Sun, Moon, and stellar deities**, merging into one. Thus, on **Jiǎzǐ Days** or **Liùjiǎ Days**, in the first year, the **Dao**-spirits command armies. In the second year, they dispel a thousand poisons and subdue ten thousand soldiers. In the third year, the **Xian Dao** is fulfilled.\n\nIf you but focus your mind—whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying—constantly preserving the original master, you will naturally attain communion with the **Dao**. Merging with **Heaven and Earth**, you will spontaneously become **True**. Your **běnmìng** (natal destiny) shall be the first to transform. **Note:** *Always meditate on the **běnmìng** as depicted; in one year, you will commune with spirits, and spirits and ghosts will revere you in awe.* After one year, the spirits of **Heaven and Earth** will all respond to your will and speech, granting no wish unfulfilled. Each passing year, your merit grows.\n\nPractice for one year and gain the **Five Spirits**. In two years, the **fa** is complete, and you become a **True Person**. In three or four years, the **Shàngqīng** will draw near, the **Yùnǚ** will descend in response, divine beings will appear, and all spirits will follow. Those who practice this **fa** will inevitably become **True**.\n\nLater, the **Sage Monarch** instructed the **Shàngyuán True Person Lǐ Fāngqī**, saying: *\"You wish to accumulate merit and receive divine summons.\"* **Note:** *The **kǎozhào fa**—healing one person’s illness counts as one merit. Three thousand people healed equal three thousand merits.* *\"To attain communion with the **yōu** (mystic depths), you must cultivate stillness and transform the body.\"* **Note:** *The steps of **bùgāng** require bodily transformation. When the ancients spoke of **zhuǎnshēn**, they referred to the modern **bùgāng**.* *\"To become **True**, quicken your steps and hasten your pace. If your **Dao**-practice is earnest and your body fails, yet your mind never ceases, you will still attain it. It is like practicing the **bù** steps—its efficacy is verified by its results.\"* **Note:** *The ancient **Xianren** all relied on mental cultivation.*\n\nWhen a person’s practice is profound and enduring, the **Dao** naturally imprints upon the mind. A single thought suffices—no difficulty remains. If you persistently uphold this practice, your descendants will inherit it, and your merit will extend to your six relations.\n\n---\n**Volume Seven of *Jīnsuǒ Liúzhū Yǐn***\n**Volume Eight of *Jīnsuǒ Liúzhū Yǐn***\n\nThe **Zhōnghuá Zǒngzhēn Dàxiānrén Zǎiwáng**—**Fāng Píng, Zhāng Dàolíng, Zhào Shēng, Wáng Cháng, Shīmìng, Lǐ Zhòngfǔ, Máoyíng, Xǔ Yùfǔ**, and others—**of the lineage** composed and annotated the texts.

If not transmitted, it must not be recklessly kept, lest it harm those who store it.*\n\nIn ancient times, the **Dìhuáng**—**Earthly Sovereign**—did not receive the reckless preservation of the Dao. Suddenly, the General appeared, his body nine hundred million *zhàng* in length. His voice like heavenly thunder, he called out to the Earthly Sovereign: *\"Earthly Son, who is your teacher? Why do you summon me?\"*\n\nThe Earthly Sovereign replied: *\"My teacher is the Five Spirits Lord.\"*\n\nThe General said: *\"Because you did not study under the Five Spirits Lord, if you had studied under the Lord, I would not have appeared. I now accuse you—what will you do? Bind yourself to him as your teacher! Bind yourself to receive the scriptures and methods. The Jade Registers are insufficient, the Golden Registers are entirely lacking. The oral transmission says: 'I received the Dao from the Eastern Xia Child. The Xia Child is your father. Though he lived, he transmitted the scriptures fully, never abridged. To claim you received the abbreviated Dao from Ling Mountain—what mountain is this? False words, false speech, will bring calamity upon your body. Give you three years to govern, then I will hold you accountable for your crimes.\"*\n\nThus, the Earthly Sovereign feared death day and night, ascending mountains and crossing waters to seek the Five Spirits Lord. When the Lord saw him, he knew he was being accused and said: *\"Great Sovereign, your adherence to the Dao is not sincere, your reviling of the Dao is not divine. Now you are punished by the Heavenly Officials—who is to blame?\"*\n\nThe Earthly Sovereign knelt twice before the Lord, declaring his guilt. *\"I am of base nature, fond of the Dao but my practice is insincere. I am a foolish man, now encountering a foolish artisan. I have recklessly cultivated, and the Heavenly Officials punish me. How dare I hope to retain my human form? I beg the Great Dao’s great mercy, to accept and command me, lest beyond three years the Heavenly Officials punish my crimes, and I lose my human form. How dare I still receive the Sovereign’s position?\"*\n\nThe Lord then transformed into a great divine method, closed his *qi*, and performed the *niǎnjué*—*muttered incantation*—which Westerners call *structuring the seal*. In an instant, the three generals—Táng, Lǐ, and Xú—descended together, acting as guarantors for the Earthly Sovereign. They transmitted the **Great Dao Golden Registers and Jade Talismans** in over eighty stages, the **Three Sovereigns’ Inner Texts**—*Heavenly, Earthly, and Human*—and forty-nine volumes of scriptures. After fourteen years of cultivation, he attained the Dao, governed the world for eighty-nine thousand years, and ascended to the **Xuánqiū Platform**.\n\nIn the presence of the original teacher, he performed the *niǎnjué* once more.\n\nHe then preserved the thought of the **Upper Primordial Upper Division Táng General**, surnamed **Táng**, named **Duǎn**.\n\n*Note: Call him softly.*\n\nThis deity is the **Tàiyī**—**Supreme Unity**—Emperor’s general. Do not call him recklessly. His body is nine hundred million *zhàng* in length. Below him is the **Five Halters Divine Functionary**, surnamed **Jiāng**, named **Dú**. His body is also nine hundred *zhàng* long. He commands a hundred thousand million layers of red-clad attendants—red-clad, with crimson headbands, holding golden talismans and wielding the **Lóngzhōu Sword**—leading a hundred thousand soldiers. Above the **thirty-two heavens**, at the **extreme of Tàiqīng**—**Supreme Clarity**—he oversees all the **heavenly lodges and star clusters**.\n\n*Note: The Supreme Lord told Pángǔ King: \"The heavenly lodges are the Twenty-Eight Constellations. The star clusters are the Nine Stars of the Central Dipper and the Nine Spirits. All the stars and clusters of the nine celestial regions above belong to this deity’s jurisdiction.\"*\n\nHe is called the **Functionary**, like a prime minister in the realm. The Upper Primordial General is like the Emperor’s position. Hence, he is said to **inspect the extremes of the Three Pure Ones**.\n\nWithin the **Great Luo’s** four directions, all life and death stem from **registration and fall**—registered to be born, fallen to die.\n\nO King, you must know this, then you will **long-live**. If you do not know, your lifespan will be short.\n\nPángǔ King knew that the **Eternal Essence** abides atop **Mèishān**, entering and exiting within the **left kidney**. Thus, for fourteen years, he cultivated and attained the **Way**, governing the realm for eighty-nine thousand years before ascending to the **Supreme Ultimate**. All the people of his realm ascended together with him.\n\nFrom the heavens above, the **Eternal Essence** descended in a dense, cloudlike form—all converging in the **Níhuán** of mortals.\n*Note: The Níhuán is the palace of the mind, named Upper Primordial, the abode of the Upper Primordial General.*\n\nIt resonates and communicates with the spirit of the left kidney. Mortals must cultivate and anchor the **Eternal Essence** in the Níhuán, where it stabilizes within the left kidney—women anchor it in the right kidney.\n\nIf one cannot discern this, they should gaze upon the *Containing Shadow Diagram* and then focus their thoughts, thereby harmonizing with the myriad heavenly deities and the body’s spirits, all converging within the self. Further, by mastering the **Thumbscrews of the Fate-Bearers**, one can immediately attain **long-life**—this is not empty doctrine.\n\nThis is what the **Later Sage-King** revealed to those who cultivated on the **Five Sacred Peaks of Ling Mountain**, including the Twenty-Eight Immortals—**Gěyuè, Péngshòu**, and others—recording their practices on Ling Mountain. These accounts were not passed down to the common world.\n\n*Note: The* Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl *states: The Later Sage-King revealed the Cloud Palace within the Níhuán, concealed within the left kidney.*\n*Note: At night, one should cultivate and anchor the Eternal Essence in the left kidney; women anchor it in the right. By day, if engaged in affairs, it may surge forth, exiting through the left eyebrow and ascending to the heavens, enveloping the body. When needed, it surges from the left eyebrow, emerging through the **Heavenly Gate** in pairs.*\n*Note: The* Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl *omits the word \"double,\" but the Later Sage-King’s revelation to Fúqiū Gōng included it. How do we know this?*\n\nFor mortals who cultivate the **Way**, their bodies attain it as well—mirroring Heaven and Earth, thus harmonizing in correspondence.\n\nThe **Supreme General of the Upper Primordial** is a celestial deity and great immortal official. Though he communicates with mortals, when humans, through sacred writs, register him within the left kidney, it is as though the human spirit and celestial deity resonate in harmony.\n\nThus, when the human spirit emerges, it ascends from the left kidney to the heavens above. The Supreme General of the Upper Primordial then descends through the **Heavenly Gate**, aligning with the human body. The human body likewise retains the brow as the form of the **Heavenly Gate**, like an inscribed petition with its diagram.\n\nThe **clustered clouds** revolve and descend, enveloping the body and household.\n\n*Note: The* Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl *omits these three characters. The Later Sage-King’s revelation to Fúqiū Gōng included them.*\n\nAs for those who cultivate the **Way**, after attaining it, they can benefit families, aid nations, and rescue people—how much more so if they can save the boundless worlds beyond their own body and household? If the body and household, or others, also attain it, in times of urgency, one may call upon the **Northern Dipper**, and it will descend immediately.\n\nWith the **coastal marshal**, *Note: The* Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl *omits the three characters \"元\" (Primordial), which appear in the Later Sage-King’s revelation,* one may dispel calamities and disasters, subdue spirits, dragons, and ghosts.\n\n*Note: These eight characters are also absent; they appear in the revelation.*\n\nThen, one turns the **Heavenly Pivot**, forms the **seal of the finger** with the hand, *Note: This is the \"twisting of the incantation.\" The incantation is hidden beneath the first fingernail of the left hand.* and with the right hand, twists it for a short while.\n\nOne takes **Yǔ’s Steps**—twelve strides, or nine. *Note: The Great Yǔ’s Step has nine strides; the Lesser Yǔ’s Step has twelve. This is the Later Sage-King’s distinction between the Great and Lesser Yǔ’s Steps. If the Most High Laozi speaks, the twelve-stride step is the Great Yǔ’s Step.*\n\nOne raises the **Heavenly Pivot**, pointing toward the direction of the malevolent force—*Note: This may be where soldiers or the sick reside, or where evil men and ghosts gather.*—and it vanishes instantly, faster than fire or water. *Note: This speaks to the swift response of the method, which can instantly manifest its efficacy. Calling without cause will bring ruin to oneself and one’s household.*\n\n*Note: The* Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl *lacks the three characters \"无事家\" (without cause, household); these are from the revelation, as cited above.*\n\nThe Most High Laozi told the Yellow Emperor:\n*\"If one’s body, household, and nation are at peace, recklessly invoking them will bring annihilation to one’s clan. Do not call upon them lightly.\"*\n\nThe **Golden Writ** states:\n*\"Lightly invoking the Northern Dipper and the Supreme General of the Upper Primordial will bring ruin to one’s body and spirit.\"*\n\nThe Most High Laozi further told **Ānhé Zǐ**—*Note: Ānhé Zǐ was the younger brother of Shénnóng, who studied the Way at Hángshān and encountered the Most High Laozi, who descended to teach him the Upper Clarity Three-Five Flying Steps of Heavenly Restraint and Earthly Measure.*—that one should always retain the essential incantation of the Three-Five, thereby summoning the Three Primordial spirits to descend and instruct in cultivation. By day, one ascends to the **Southern Extreme Fire World** of the heavens, refining gold and stone as the foundation of the earth, and declares:\n\n*\"Among the Three Primordials, the Supreme General of the Upper Primordial is the most noble and exalted—like the position of a sovereign emperor in the world. It is greatly capable of helping one attain the Way. When using it, one must not act recklessly. Only on one’s natal day, **Jiazi days**, or **Upper Primordial days**—*Note: Jiazi is the Upper Primordial; one must not act recklessly on Jiazi days outside of these specified occasions.*—should one cultivate and employ it. If suddenly there is an urgent matter in one’s body or household—being plotted against, a grave illness on the verge of death, or bandits—one may call upon it, and it will vanish instantly. This is highly efficacious. Even if not on these days, it will still work.*\n\nThe Later Sage-King told the **Celestial Master Dàolíng**:\n*\"You wish to teach others to escape calamity and enter the path of longevity. Take the **Upper Primordial day**—*Note: From the Jiazi cycle, select the Upper, Middle, or Lower Primordial days.*—of that person’s natal hour, day or night, and beneath the Northern Dipper, burn incense while focusing on one’s original teacher. Upon completion, visualize the Supreme General of the Upper Primordial descending into the **Níhuán Palace**, then entering the left kidney. Next, the Middle Primordial, then the Lower Primordial—*Note: The Middle Primordial enters the right kidney; the Lower Primordial enters the heart.*—first stopping the spirit at the Níhuán, then entering the heart and kidneys to stabilize the five viscera.\n\nThen, twist the incantation, take **Yǔ’s Steps**—four steps, twelve strides—and upon completion, visualize it emerging to envelop the body, like the **Encompassing Diagram**, fully encompassing the Three Primordials and Five Phases, the **Thunder Lord’s Five Thunders**, and the Eight Trigrams, sun, moon, and stars. When complete, recite the **Five Phases Eighteen Incantations** once to seek longevity. Within a year, one will enter the path of immortality. In two years, one will be named **Long-lived**, avoiding soldiers and escaping calamities, attaining spirit efficacy, moving heaven and earth by will, and achieving fulfillment of the heart. All will enter the Níhuán. Later, they will respectively enter the heart and kidneys. After a short while, when the body’s spirit is settled and still, one may summon it forth again, like the Encompassing Diagram. Upon completion, twist the incantation, close the **qi**, and take **Yǔ’s Steps**—twelve strides—to seek life and escape calamity. Within a year, the spiritual efficacy will manifest instantly, greatly aiding the **Heavenly Restraint and Earthly Measure**.\n\nYou must not recklessly transmit this to unworthy individuals. This method of the Three Primordials’ five techniques can directly lead one into the Great Way’s gate. Keep it secret for good fortune; reveal it for misfortune.*\n\nThe Most High Laozi told the **Three Primordial Deities of Antiquity**:\n*\"Cultivating the Three Primordials begins with the Upper Primordial’s natal day. Next is the Middle Primordial, then the Lower Primordial, completing the cycle. Within a year of cultivation, one may attain five degrees.* *Note: Within the sixty Jiazi days of the Upper Primordial, there is one natal degree. In the Jiazi days of the Middle Primordial, there are two natal degrees. In the Jiazi days of the Lower Primordial, there are three natal degrees. Following this cycle back to the Upper Primordial, one selects the natal day for practice. Within two years, ten days of cultivation will lead to the path of immortality.*\n\nThe Later Sage-King bestowed a **talisman of the Supreme General of the Upper Primordial** upon **Zhāng Dàolíng**, instructing him to swallow it. After swallowing, one should visualize its deployment—nothing will remain unfulfilled. He also commanded that it be passed down secretly among worthy disciples.\"\n\nThe Later Sage-King instructed those of **virtue/power** (志人): *Note: \"Worthy disciples\" (志人) are those who share his noble aspirations.* The **adepts of the Dao/Way** (志道之士), saying: \"Thus, one may attain the **Way of the True Person** (真人之道).\"\n\nThe Later Sage-King then bestowed the **talisman of the Supreme General of the Middle Primordial** (上元中部将军符) upon **Zhāng Dàolíng**, commanding him to swallow it. Upon swallowing, one should perform the rites of the Middle Primordial (行中部事), and he was also instructed to pass it down secretly among worthy disciples (志人), so that all may attain the **True Dao** (真道).\n\nNext, the Later Sage-King bestowed the **talisman of the Supreme General of the Lower Primordial** (上元下部将军符) upon **Zhāng Dàolíng**, commanding him to swallow it. After swallowing, one should perform the rites of the Lower Primordial (行下部事), and he was instructed to transmit it to worthy disciples (志人) in succession through the generations, so that all may proclaim the **Way of Supreme Truth** (至真之道).\n\nThe Later Sage-King bestowed these three talismans (三符), each to be swallowed in turn, and declared to the **Supreme Generals of the Three Primordials** (命上元三部将军): \"Let them aid and assist those who receive the **Three Five Primordial Rectification Laws** (太玄三五正法).\" When practicing, one should meditate upon and visualize them—calling them forth, they will manifest according to one’s words and desires, and one’s intentions will be fulfilled. *Swiftly, swiftly, as the command is decreed!* (急急如律令) These three talismans are inscribed in **cinnabar** (朱书).\n\nAgain, he instructed **Shànxíngzǐ** (善行子): *Note: \"Shànxíngzǐ\" is the grandson of Lǐ Shàojūn, who attained the Dao/Way through his ancestral **virtue/power** (福德) and ascended to the **West Peak Cavern of the Primordial** (洞天) in the Western Mountains, where he took the name \"Shànxíngzǐ.\"* Though you are devoted to the Dao/Way and your efforts are diligent, you have not grasped its principles. The principles derive from the **Three Primordials** (三元), yet cultivation begins through the **Five Phases** (五行). You may take **Zhāng Dàolíng** as your teacher.\n\nThus, **Shànxíngzǐ** entered **Shù** (蜀), seeking to receive the **Three Primordial Laws** (上三部之法) and the **essentials of the Five Phases** (五行之要). After fourteen years of cultivation, he ascended to the **West Peak Cavern of the Spirit-Master’s Palm** (西灵仙掌洞天). Thereafter, there were hundreds of disciples who followed this **Three-Five Law** (三五之法), all attaining the **Way of the True Person** (真人).\n\nThe **Supreme Elderly Lord** (太上老君) instructed **Rénhuáng** (人皇): \"The king seeks the **Supreme Dao** (至道), desiring to attain the **True Nature** (真性). The **True Nature** lies within the **Three-Five Primordial Power** (三五三五之力), which is the **Dao Ancestor** (道祖). As water emerges from its spring, one attains its flowing source. As a person emerges from their cave, one attains their entrance and abode.\"\n\nThe **Supreme Elderly Lord** further expounds:\n\n*\"In ancient times, people dwelled in caves, hence the saying ‘emerging from the cave.’ The king received [the Dao], and his lifespan matched the extremes of Heaven and Earth. **Annotation:** The **Rénhuáng** received it. Indeed, he attained immortality, ruling for eighty-nine thousand years. Later, his entire palace ascended to the **Supreme Ultimate** (太极). He also left writings behind in the world; today, the *Rénhuáng Text* (《人皇文》) is transmitted.*\n\nThe **Supreme Elderly Lord** said: ‘The **Great Dao** has myriad gates and doors, yet its essentials are few. Earlier, I spoke of the **Three-Five** origin and the **Three Primordial Laws**, yet this has not yet exhausted its fundamental roots. Now, I shall enumerate them one by one in the following volumes.\n\nThe **principles, keys, incantations, and talismanic symbols**—though few in words—directly lead one into the **inner gates** to perceive the **Dao**. **Annotation:** This volume concludes the teachings on the **Three Generals**. It expounds the **Stepwise Principles, Rectified Keys, Talismanic Symbols, and Incantations**—these should be the matters of the **Upper Primordial Law’s** three divisions, all enumerated in their respective titles.\n\nNext, consider the **Upper Primordial Law’s** middle division: **General Li** (李将军), surnamed **Li**, named **Jù** (拒). **Annotation:** He is invoked in a low, reverent tone—one of the **Supreme One’s** honored divine generals. His stature measures seven hundred million *zhang*. He commands—**Annotation:** The *Jīnsuǒ Liúzhū* (《金锁流珠》) does not mention ‘commands,’ yet in the sacred texts received by the **Ancient Sovereign** (上圣君), both the upper, middle, and lower sections include the character ‘commands.’ This must be an omission in the transmission. The *Liúzhū*’s emergence in the world is ancient and distant; the records of its transmission have been lost over time. It must have existed originally—it was not absent. Now, I proceed according to the transmitted accounts.\"*\n\n「Five [Divine] Generals of Rigidity\n**Annotation:** According to the *Tóngtiān Zhōngbù* (《洞天中本》), the term *gāng* (纲) is used, while the *Ancient Sovereign* (前圣君) transmitted the term *jiāng* (将). The *Later Sovereign* (后圣君) instructed the *Sōngzǐ* (松子), naming them the **Five Generals of Rigidity** (五刚功曹), confirming the use of *jiāng* (将).\n\nThe *Liúzhū* (《流珠》) originally was the *Jīnluó* (《金箓》). The *Ancient Sovereign* and *Later Sovereign* did not grant permission to alter it, so I dare not change it. The **Functionary of Rigidity** (功曹), surnamed **Zhāng**, named **Lǐ**.\n**Annotation:** Another account says his personal name is **Jì** (季).\n\nHis stature measures seven hundred *zhang*. **Annotation:** The *Liúzhū* (《流珠》) does not record his stature as seven hundred *zhang*, but the *Ancient Sovereign*’s transmission includes these five characters.\n\nThe **Hundred-Thousands-and-Tens-of-Thousands of Troops** (百千万重人), **Annotation:** According to the *Liúzhū* (《流珠》), the account is not detailed, and their affairs are not explicitly revealed. However, if we follow the *Later Sovereign*’s instruction to the *Dōnghǎi Xiǎotóng Jūn* (东海小童君), the **Upper Primordial Law’s** (上元) middle division has one general, surnamed **Lǐ**, named **Jù** (拒), with a stature of seven hundred million *zhang*, who commands one **Functionary of Rigidity** (五刚功曹), surnamed **Zhāng**, named **Jì** (季). The **Hundred-Thousands-and-Tens-of-Thousands of Troops** (百十万重人), their number unknown, are under his command. This refers to two individuals: the general and the functionary. The remaining hundred-thousands-and-tens-of-thousands of troops are the **divine officers and soldiers** (兵吏).\n\nThey wear **crimson headgear** (赤帻), and with their **right hand hold a spear** (右手持戟), their **waist sash bears the Sword of Subduing Demons** (腰带消魔之剑).\n**Annotation:** The *Liúzhū* (《流珠》) states: The general of the upper division, **Táng Jiāngjūn** (唐将军), wears a waist sash with the **Dragon-Scented Sword** (龙浓之剑). The middle division general lacks a name in the text. The **Sword of Subduing Demons** (消魔之剑) is the name given by the **Supreme Venerable Lord Lǎojūn** (太上老君). The *Later Sovereign* instructed the *Dōnghǎi Xiǎotóng Jūn* (东海小童君) that the three generals of the three divisions wear the **Sword of Commanding Demons** (命魔之剑), which belongs to the upper division. The **Sword of Subduing Demons** (消魔之剑) is for the middle division. According to the Master’s words, there are many omissions, as it has been this way since ancient times—not a recent loss in transmission. They reside within the **Tàiqīng** (太清), beneath the **Shàngqīng** (上清).\n**Annotation:** The **Supreme Venerable Lord Lǎojūn** (太上老君) told **Hán Yìzǐ** (韩义子), the **Tàihuáng** (太皇), saying: “The Heavenly Grandson (天之孙), *Tàiqīng* (太清) is the designation of *Tàijī* (太极). *Shàngqīng* (上清) is the designation of *Dàluó* (大罗), within the **Three Purities** (三清).” They are positioned above the **Middle Heaven** (中天).\n\nThey often descend into the **right middle chamber of the Mudan Palace** (泥丸宫右中) within a human body, as previously described. In youth, they enter the **right kidney** (右肾) to subdue and control affairs, then shortly emerge at the **right eyebrow** (右眉上), like a contained **Great Expansion** (含弘). When they exit through the **Upper Celestial Gate** (上应天门),\n**Annotation:** The *Later Sovereign* instructed the Master: “When you summon the three divine generals from the *Upper Primordial Law* (上元), they originally reside above the **Three Purities** (上三清), descending into the **Nine Chambers of the Human Body** (人身泥九中). In youth, they again enter the **right kidney** (右肾中), subduing and concealing themselves within the body. Then, you think of them ascending from the kidney to the **right eyebrow** (右眉头), emerging as if from the **Celestial Gate** (天门).”\n\nThis is said to mean: “From Heaven descending into my body, receiving my command to patrol the heavens and inspect the earth, annihilating malevolent forces, ordering the **Three Officials** (三官) to manifest my form, and aligning with the **Great Dao of Heaven and Earth** (天地大道). When I chant to commune with the divine, then ten-thousands of gods and spirits, hundreds of spirits and thousands of malevolent forces, tens of thousands of **precise essences** (精) and human-shaped dragons (人龙) will revere me. Thus, with the **virtue of non-action** (无为之德), I attain the **Dao of longevity** (长生之道).\n\nTheir manifestation follows the diagram. **Annotation:** The diagram of **Great Expansion** (含弘) exists at the **right eyebrow** (右眉头), emerging gradually higher and longer, and the body grows accordingly, reaching a height of twelve hundred million *zhang*.\n\nUpon completion, the hands are withdrawn, and the **Incantation of the Three Primordial Generals** (三元将军诀) is recited. Then, ascending the **upper division** (上部) and **middle division** (中部) of the *Primordial Law*, step by step, the teeth are struck thirty-six times.\n\nThe eyes are then opened, and the incantation is recited:\n*“Ancient Sovereign and Later Sovereign, teach me—another account says to invoke by name for longevity—\nto stride through the Three Primordial [Divisions],\ncommanding the Nine Generals and Ten-Thousands of Troops,\nto govern the Six *Jia* (甲),\nalign with the Seven Stars,\nand swallow the Six Officials and Seven [Entities].\nAnnotation: Six refers to the Six *Jia* talismans (六甲符). Seven refers to the Seven Stars (七星).\nMalevolent forces are beheaded,\nMetal and Wood harmonize,\nWater and Fire balance,\nHumans dare not offend me,\nGhosts dare not conjure malevolent forces.\nIf any dare offend me,\nthe **Celestial Barrier** (天关) will extinguish your life.”\nAnnotation: This refers to invoking the **Celestial Barrier** (天关), pointing to it to bring about annihilation.\n\nThe incantation concluded, the **Incantation of the Upper Primordial General’s Diagram** (上元将军纲) is recited three times. Next, the **Middle Primordial Law** (中元), then the **Lower Primordial Law** (下元). Each division has its own diagram and incantation, recited three times each.\n\nFor each recitation of the diagram incantation, the steps are accompanied by the words *“sè sè”* (摄摄).\n**Annotation:** The youth’s words are also recited three times.\nIf malevolent humans or ghosts appear, the words *“chì chì”* (叱叱) are recited three times.\n**Annotation:** If treating malevolent humans, the **Knife Support of the Malevolent** (恶人刀支) is pinched.\n**Annotation:** The **Knife Support of the Malevolent** (人刀支) is located on the right side of the **third node of the fifth finger on the right hand** (右手第五指第三节). Left governs killing; right governs release. Both release and subjugation must be applied with proper reason and not recklessly.\n\nIn practice, it must strictly adhere to the Dao.\n\nIf treating malevolent ghosts, the **Knife Support of the Ghosts** (鬼刀支) is pinched.\n**Annotation:** The **Knife Support of the Ghosts** (鬼刀支) is located on the upper side of the **third node of the fifth finger on the left hand** (左手五指第三节). It is the **Knife Support of the Ghosts** in total. When addressing a specific ghost, the appropriate pinch is applied as described.\n\nThe eighth volume of the *Jīnsuǒ Liúzhū* (《金锁流珠》) transmission concludes. The ninth volume begins.\n\nFor treating malevolent humans and ghostly spirits alike, one must utter the command **\"Chì-chì\"** three times.\n\nIf addressing a malevolent person, pinch the **Knife Support of the Malevolent** (兽目).\n**Annotation:** The **Knife Support of the Malevolent** (人刀支) is located on the right side of the **third node of the fifth finger on the right hand** (右手第五指第三节). Left governs killing; right governs release. Both release and subjugation must be applied with proper reason and not recklessly. In practice, it must strictly adhere to the Dao.\n\nThe **Knife Support of the Ghosts** (鬼刀支) is pinched when treating malevolent ghosts.\n**Annotation:** The **Knife Support of the Ghosts** (鬼刀支) is located on the upper side of the **third node of the fifth finger on the left hand** (左手五指第三节). It is the **Knife Support of the Ghosts** in total. When addressing a specific ghost, the appropriate pinch is applied as described.\n\nThe transmission of the *Jīnsuǒ Liúzhū* (《金锁流珠》) concludes its eighth volume.\nThe ninth volume begins.\n\n---\n\nThe **Great True Master of the Central Plain** (中华总真大仙), **Lord of the Netherworld** (宰王) **Fāng Píng**, **Zhāng Dàolíng**, **Zhào Shēng**, **Lord of the Netherworld** (司命) **Wáng Cháng**, **Lǐ Zhòngfǔ**, **Máo Yíng**, **Xǔ Yùfǔ**, and others, are the successive authors of this text.\nThe **Daoist Sage** (仙人) **Lǐ Chúnfēng** provided the annotations.\nThe **General Step Diagram of the Upper Primordial** (上元上部将军步纲图) follows.\n\nThe **Pre-Eminent Sage** (前圣老君) instructed **Yǔ** (禹) with the **Step Diagram** (步纲).\n**Annotation:** **Yǔ** received three grades of **Yǔ’s Step** (禹步): the first, three steps with nine traces; the second, twenty-two traces; the third, twenty-eight traces. Now, this **Great Daoist Method of the Three Five** (三五大法) is universal, and **Yǔ’s Step** is no longer transmitted, forever ceasing in the world.\n\nThe **Post-Eminent Sage** (后圣君) then instructed **Fāng Zhūtóng** (方诸童君), **Yǐn Xǐ** (尹喜), **True Person of the Netherworld Lord** (真人王君), and **Zhang Tiānshī** (张天师) and others. Those who recorded in **crimson script** (朱书) were all instructed by the **Post-Eminent Sage**.\n\nWith the **right foot stamping the ground** (右脚蹈地) and the **left foot turning once** (左转一转), one proceeds according to the matter at hand.\n\nThe **Pre-Eminent Sage** (老君) instructed **Huángdì** (黄帝) with seven **Daoist Secrets for Seeking Longevity** (求长生等法诀):\n\n1. **Secret for Seeking Longevity and Honor** (求长生於世为荣贵法诀): Pinch the **Netherworld Lord’s Eye** (司命目) and recite the **Five Elements Incantation** (五行祝) once.\n   The incantation reads: *\"Gold, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth, blessings be upon you.\"*\n\n2. **Secret for Summoning the Celestial Fox** (追召天狐法): Pinch the **Beast’s Eye** (兽目) and say, *\"I request the Upper Primordial General* (上部功曹) *to summon and limit [the fox] to arrive by a certain day.\"*\n\n3. **Secret for Summoning the Dragon** (召龙捻龙诀): Pinch the **Dragon Secret**.\n\n4. **Secret for Summoning the Celestial Netherworld Lord** (召天神司命): To summon the **Netherworld Lord** (司命) and grant longevity, pinch the **Netherworld Lord’s Eye**.\n\n5. **Secret for Summoning and Slaying Celestial Demons** (召杀天上妖魅): Pinch the **Knife Support of the Celestial Ghosts** (天鬼刀支).\n\n6. **Secret for Summoning the Gods of the Sun, Moon, and Stars** (召请日月星辰神): Pinch the **Sun-Moon-Star Host Secret**.\n   **Annotation:** This is located beneath the **left hand’s fingernail** (左手甲下).\n\n7. **Secret for Ascending to Heaven** (欲升天): To ascend to heaven, or to think of one’s own spirit ascending to heaven, or to pursue celestial demons, ghosts, dragons, beasts, such as **Heavenly Dogs** (天狗) and **Heavenly Leopards** (天豹), or when the **spirits of the deceased** (祟人合死者) are summoned—before contemplating the original master, and after emerging from all departments, like **Hán Hóngbīng** (含弘兵) in joint pursuit and slaying—one pinches the **General Overseer Secret** (都监诀).\n\nThe **Post-Eminent Sage** (后圣君) said: *\"After completing the steps, pinch the Upper Primordial General Secret\"* (上元上部将军诀).\n**Annotation:** The secret is located beneath the **left hand’s first finger’s nail** (左手第一指甲下) and also at two places on the **middle node** (中节).\n\nTo seek entry into the **Celestial Register** (仙籍) or to practice the Dao while avoiding calamities:\n**Annotation:** If one encounters misfortune, decline, or malevolent illnesses, one must compose a petition in detail.\n\nOr if one seeks **virtue and power** (福德) for another, or to dispel spirits and remove disasters and calamities, one must also compose a petition in detail. All such matters can be resolved.\n\nThe **Pre-Eminent Sage** (老君) said: *\"The Upper Primordial’s original fate-day is for seeking longevity. Begin with the Upper Primordial General, then proceed to the Middle Primordial, and finally to the Lower Primordial.\"*\n\nWithin the **Upper Primordial**, the steps are the same.\n**Annotation:** The **Middle Primordial** and **Lower Primordial** are also used in total, though their applications vary.\n\nFor the **Upper Primordial’s original fate-day**, recite the **Upper Primordial steps** three times and pinch the secret. Upon completion, **store the Upper Primordial General** (存上元上部唐将军).\n**Annotation:** The **Upper Primordial General** (坎中元上部唐将军) is stored in the **Marrow Palace** (泥丸宫), entering through the **Upper Primordial General** (上元上部).\n\nAfterward, it is directed to the **left kidney’s center** (臣则玄左肾中).\n**Annotation:** When contemplating the stored image, as in **Hán Hóngbīng’s Diagram** (含影图), this is called the **True Spirit and Soul** (正魂魄).\n\nAfter two years, the **verification of immortality** (神仙不死之验) is achieved, and the **Upper Primordial matters are concluded**.\n\n---\n\nThe **General Step Diagram of the Middle Primordial** (上元中部将军步纲图) follows.\n**Yǔ** (禹) received the **Step Diagram’s Dao** (步纲之道) from the **Pre-Eminent Sage** and applied it to the **Middle Primordial**.\n**Annotation:** The **Middle Primordial** pertains to humanity (属人), the **Upper Primordial** to heaven (属天), and the **Lower Primordial** to earth (属地). Within the three departments, the **Middle Primordial** and **Lower Primordial** contain far more techniques than the **Upper Primordial**. The **Middle Primordial** handles human affairs, and the **Lower Primordial** handles earthly affairs. These methods are highly refined.\n\nOne may **dispatch tasks** (效功), **collect and bind those of virtue** (收捕有德), **conscript human and ghostly spirits** (驱役人鬼), **part the waters and open mountains** (决水开山), **control ghosts and aid humans** (制鬼助人), **command dragons and tigers** (使龙使虎), **manifest the nine traces** (分变九迹), **establish the myriad protections** (成卫万端), **accumulate virtue and goodness** (积德累仁), and **ascend to the Great Polarity** (飞身太极).\n\nThe **Middle Primordial** is retained to teach those with sincere intent.\n**Annotation:** The **Upper Primordial General’s Step** (上部将军步) is transmitted in the world, known as the **Great Yǔ’s Step** (大禹步), also consisting of **fifteen steps** (一十五步). Its practice is intricate, hence slightly more difficult than the **Upper Primordial**. The **Lower Primordial** has similar techniques, but if one is proficient, it will not be difficult.\n\nThose who **aspire to the Dao** (志道之人) can **conscript dragons, tigers, and leopards** (役使蛟龙虎豹), **save and assist the world’s people** (济助世人), and **simultaneously enable others to attain the Dao** (兼令得道), **riding dragons and taming tigers and leopards** (乘龙御虎豹).\n\nWith the **left foot stamping once** (左脚踏一转讫), one proceeds according to one’s heart’s wish.\n\nThis is the **prohibition of the Middle Primordial General** (中部李将军行禁), involving the **Five Elements** (五行), **Six Palaces** (六甲), **Seven Stars** (七星), **Nine Refined Essences** (九精), and **Five Battles** (五斗). When practiced, these steps are as **easy as wearing a garment** (依之如衣), and their power is as **obedient as a servant** (使之如仆), all in accordance with one’s heart and tongue.\n\nThe **Post-Eminent Sage** (后圣君) instructed the **Netherworld Lord** (命), and the incantation began with the **initial step** (初起纲), which also included:\n\n*\"The **Great Unity** (太一) is my body,\nI am the **Celestial Ancestor** (天中仙祖).\nMy head is the **Great Unity Palace** (太一府),\nMy feet are the **Celestial Pillars** (天柱).\nMy five **viscera** (五藏) are the **Six Palaces** (六甲),\nGuarding the **Celestial Pass** (天关),\nDriving the **Big Dipper** (北斗).\nWith a single command,\nTen thousand gods and myriad spirits\nAll follow my words and move.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the **precepts decree** (如律令).\"*\n\nThe **Venerable Master** (老君) instructed the **Yellow Emperor** (黄帝) and the **Young Lords of the Four Directions** (方诸童君), saying:\n\n*\"This method consists of sixteen precepts. It is the **Central Department General** (中部将军) who governs and commands the troops. When practicing, recite the **Step Framework** (步纲) three times, then pinch the **Central Department General’s Secret** (中部将军诀).\n**Note:** The Secret is found in the middle joint of the left hand’s first finger.\n\nThe first precept: Though the Central Department is the **Lord of the Upper Primordial** (上元主人), humans belong to the Central Department, which itself contains **Three Generals**.\n**Note:** These correspond to the **Upper, Middle, and Lower Primordials** (上中下三元).\n\nThis **Central Department General** can guide a person toward the **True Dao/Way of Immortality** (正仙道). On one’s **Middle Primordial natal day** (中元本命日), perform these sixteen precepts—these are the essential methods for all worldly applications, not merely the Step Framework.\n\n**First Method:**\nOn one’s **Middle Primordial natal day**, recite the **Central Department Li General Framework** (中部李将军纲) three times to stabilize the **True Spirit** (正魂) and subdue the **Ephemeral Soul** (魄).\n\nRecite:\n*\"Li General, enter my right kidney,\nGe General serves as your deputy.\nMay you grant me **Mysterious Longevity** (玄长生),\nLong life in this world,\nFearless and without dread.\"\n**Note:** The General is stored in the right kidney, preserved like an **Image Diagram** (含影图), seated and guarding the kidney.\n\nAfter reciting, strike the teeth twelve times, then pinch the **Central Department Secret** (中部诀).\n**Note:** The Secret is in the middle joint of the left hand’s first finger.\n\nPractice this method for one year, and **Mysterious Longevity** and prolonged vision will manifest. All hundred methods will verify its efficacy.\n\n**Second Method:**\nWhen facing **calamity, misfortune, or illness**, return to one’s **Middle Primordial natal day**. Begin from the **Five Torments of the Body** (自身五苦地), recite the Framework once, and exit the **Royal Constellation** (出王相).\n**Note:** The Royal Constellation is calculated in the **Five Phases divination** (上五行引中注).\n\nRecite:\n*\"From death to life,\n**Note:** In ritual texts and petitions, if the word *death* (死) appears in the upper line, the word *life* (生) must not align below it—this is taboo.\nEndless regeneration,\nAttaining the **Great Peace** (太平).\"*\n\nAfter completing the **Five Phases**, pinch the **Water-Fire-Earth Knife Supports** (水火土刀支) according to one’s **natal element**:\n- **Metal-natal** (金命) individuals pinch **Fire Knife Support** (火刀支),\n- **Wood-natal** (木命) individuals pinch **Metal Knife Support** (金刀支),\n- **Water-natal** (水命) individuals pinch **Earth Knife Support** (土刀支),\n- **Fire-natal** (火命) individuals pinch **Water Knife Support** (水刀支),\n- **Earth-natal** (土命) individuals pinch **Wood Knife Support** (木刀支).\n\nEach natal element has its own **Knife Supports** to break the **Five Torments, Eight Hardships, Nine Calamities, and Hundred Illnesses** (五苦八难九厄百病). Recite the Framework within the **Three-Five Methods** (三五法) to dissipate them. If misfortunes are not eliminated within a year, they will not prevail, and the practitioner will achieve **longevity**.\n\nThe **Five Knife Supports** are detailed in the **Palm Diagram** (掌图).\n\n**Third Method:**\nIf one’s **residence or courtyard is restless**, select a **Middle Primordial day of the Jiazi cycle** (中元甲子日), recite the Framework while circling the dwelling three times, or take **long strides** (长禹步)—the number of steps is irrelevant; completion of the circuit is paramount.\n\nAfter three circuits, recite:\n*\"The **Supreme Male** (乾尊) radiates with spirit,\nThe **Supreme Female** (坤) harmonizes within.\nThus it is.\" (云云).*\n\nAs recorded in *The Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl* (《金锁流珠》), within the **Upper Alley** (上巷), the dwelling will then stabilize.\n\n**Fourth Method:**\nIf **family members suffer illness** or the household is restless, select a **Middle Primordial day of Jiawu, Jiaxu, Gengshen, or Renyin** (中元甲午日、甲申、庚申、壬寅日). In the courtyard, recite the **Upper, Middle, and Lower Department Generals’ Frameworks** (上中下三部将军纲), one circuit each, then pinch the **Bright Hall Secret** (明堂诀).\n**Note:** The Secret is pinched on the second joint of the left hand’s second finger.\n\nSpit **saliva in the four directions**, storing the **Three Generals**—each commanding **three million soldiers**—to encircle the residence three times. Drive out **fire, water, lion, and serpent soldiers**, banishing **ghostly and demonic qi**, purifying the clear and dispelling the turbid.\n\nAfterward, inscribe a **Residence-Suppressing Talisman** (镇宅符) and affix it to the doors.\n**Note:** The Residence-Suppressing Talisman is found in the **Miscellaneous Talismans of the Three Departments** (三部杂符文).\n\nRecite:\n*\"The talisman subjugates a hundred ghosts,\nThe evil spirits are vanquished and suppressed.\nThe **Mysterious Tortoise** (玄武) ceases theft,\nThe **White Tiger**... (白虎云云).\"\n\n**Fifth Method:**\nIf **besieged by armies** or engaged in battle, mentally perform **fifteen strides of the Central Department’s Great Step** (中部禹步一十五迹), followed by **fifteen strides of the Lower Department** (下部十五迹), then **turn the Celestial Pass** (转天关), pointing as you go, while storing the **Three Departments**.\n**Note:** The **Upper, Middle, and Lower Primordials** (上中下三元) command the **Nine Generals** (总都部九将军) to strike and disperse the enemy. The practitioner will then **break through and escape**; pinch the **Knife Support Secret** (刀支诀) immediately.\n**Note:** The Secret is on the right side of the second joint of the left hand’s fifth finger. Pinch urgently until blood appears.\n\nUse this to align with the **Five Battles Garment** (五斗衣), pointing five times. Where pointed, the enemy will break. Then lead the troops to charge, and the enemy will collapse and retreat. Release the Knife Support immediately—otherwise, they will die.\n\nRecite:\n*\"From death to life,\nSwiftly ascending to the **Celestial Court** (天庭).\nThe **Azure Dragon** (青龙) supports my escape,\nThe **White Tiger** (白虎) guards my path.\nI am the **Celestial Envoy** (天使) of the **Celestial Pass** (天关),\nBreaking through your five armies.\n**Swiftly, swiftly break!** (急急急急急急破).\nAs the precepts decree.\" (急急如律令).\"\n\n**Notes:**\nRaise the flag, charge with horses, strike the drums, and break through—then depart immediately.\n\n**Sixth Method:** When traveling far and passing through mountains or grasslands, fearing bandits, wild beasts, or venomous creatures—whether malevolent humans or poisonous beasts—seize a treeless spot. Walk the **Three Generals’ *Yubu* Steps** (禹步) in the upper, middle, and lower sections, each three times. Then pinch the throat and eyes of a living person, the **Knife Support**, and the eyes of snakes and tigers. Upon completion, ascend to the **Nine Heavens above**—*i.e.*, the **Alone-Empty Void** (孤虚). Should you encounter malevolent or venomous beings, strike the Void alone; even one woman can defeat nine men without fear. You will never again meet such creatures. If encountered, they will flee in terror and never harm you again.\n\n**Incantation:**\n*\"Lofty and pure, you wicked one—you die, I return.\nI press the Three Elements, sealing water and mountain.\nBandits and beasts flee far—no need for paths between.\nThe earth’s axis binds you without effort.\nIf you refuse to leave, bind you swiftly, bind you swiftly, bind you swiftly.\nAs the precepts decree.\"*\n\n**Note:** Before setting out, practice the **Heavenly Halter Steps** (天纲) at home. While walking, no bandits or beasts will dare approach you—those that do will die.\n\n---\n\n**Seventh Method:** If a relative or Daoist associate in another prefecture falls ill—or if there is no barrier separating you—*i.e.*, parents, uncles, brothers, cousins, or even non-blood kin like Daoist friends or disciples (but not outsiders without righteous intent)—begin with the **Middle Section**.\n\n**Note:** The **Heavenly Halter** (天纲) is walked in the middle section first, then the Upper and Lower Sections, each three times. The **Celestial Sovereign** then instructs the **Heavenly Master**:\n*\"You must also tread the **Celestial Pass** (天关) and **Earthly Measure** (地纪), each once—or reverse and return three times. Then summon the **Middle Element’s Tang General** (唐将军), one figure, eighty-one *zhang* tall, with a red headband, a **Heaven-Piercing Crown**, a sword at his side, and a spear in hand, commanding a million troops. He proceeds to the sick person’s home, sets it ablaze to drive away ghosts, thrusts his sword into the door, and roars three to five times. Lions, dragons, and serpents enter the house—above the bed, below the bed, within the walls, before the door, behind the door, left and right—slaying all malevolent, poisonous, or afflicting spirits. Let the sand collapse and tiles shatter; let the deer flee a thousand *li*. Purge and exterminate all evil. When done, the illness will swiftly abate, and the enemy’s forces will be defeated. Report thus.\"*\n\n**Note:** Compose the ritual words and pinch the **Upper Element Secret**. Next, summon the **Middle Element’s Ge General** (葛将军), seventy-two *zhang* tall, with a red headband, a **Heaven-Piercing Crown**, a sword at his side, and a scepter in hand, commanding thirty million troops to the sick person’s home in such-and-such prefecture, county, village, and household. *Note:* Adjust according to the illness—fearing harm from malevolent ghosts or spirits. Burn the house with fire and water, drive away ghostly bandits, thrust the sword into the door, and roar three to five times, as before.\n\nNext, summon the **Middle Element’s Zhou General** (周将军), ninety-six *zhang* tall, with a red headband, a **Heaven-Piercing Crown**, a sword at his side, a scepter, and a talisman, commanding thirty million troops to the specified location. Proceed as before. Then pinch the **Secret**.\n\n**Note:** The **Secret** is on the first joint of the left hand’s thumb. Pinch urgently, and the three generals’ formation will fly to the sky, obscuring the sun. Upon arrival, they will slaughter poisonous and disease-causing ghosts and bandits. Follow the **Three Elements, Three Generals’ Method** as illustrated in *The Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl* (金锁流珠), using visualization.\n\n---\n**Eighth Method:** If you or your six relatives or Daoist associates are slandered, defamed, or plotted against, walk the **Heavenly Halter** and **Earthly Measure** once each. Then disperse your steps outward, leaving fifteen footprints in a wide arc. Walk the **Middle Element’s *Yubu* Steps** three times, then pinch the **Knife Support** of the offending person.\n\n**Note:** Pinch the **Knife Support** briefly—it will not harm the previous target. If pinched for too long, the person will weaken and die within ten or five days. Observe the signs carefully; do not harm others recklessly. Within a month or half, the matter will resolve as before.\n\n**Immediately declare:**\n*\"Because of a certain matter, I am slandered by a certain person, causing my body to be restless. Now I summon one **Middle Element General**, along with one each from the **Upper Element** and **Lower Element Generals**, and thirty million soldiers. As your servant, I command the **Dark Resolution** to remove the malevolent person’s wicked schemes, their slanderous plots, and suppress them so they dare not act. Urgently make that person hide in shame and suffer misfortune themselves. May all slanderous matters depart from my body and instead harm that person’s life. Swiftly, as the law commands.\"*\n\nThen recite the *Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl* (**金锁流珠**) **Earthly Measure** spell eighteen times. The spell reads:\n*\"I receive the **Heavenly Qi**, and I act as the envoy of Heaven and Earth.\"* (Repeat as above.)\n\nThe eighteen spells are all contained within the **Earthly Measure Scripture**; recite each one in turn. Upon completion, pinch the **Slander Seal**.\n\n**Note:** The **Slander Seal** is located on the left hand’s fifth finger, at the third joint’s **wen** (vein), moving upward to the right side. Pinch the **Slander Seal** at the first finger’s second joint and beneath the fingernail.\n\n**Ninth Method:** Always expel the **Three Corpses Worms** from your body, ensuring no reckless daytime mistakes or internal illnesses arise, so you may attain eternal life. Do this by selecting **Middle Element** or **Gengshen** days, walking the **Middle Element General’s *Yubu* Steps** three times, then reciting the eighteen-spell incantation. Upon completion, ingest the **talisman**. (The talisman is found in the *One Hundred Fifty Generals’ Spirit Scripture*.)\n\n**Tenth Method:** Each year, select **Middle Element** or **Jiazi** days, walk the **Middle Element General’s *Yubu* Steps** three times, then ingest **three Soul-Subduing Talismans**. **Note:** One for the **Upper Element**, one for the **Middle Element**, and one for the **Lower Element**. Then recite the **Five Phases Heavenly Halter Flying Steps Spell**—the five phases (metal, wood, water, fire, earth) in sequence, with the seven stars resplendent, for the **Heavenly Halter’s supreme might**. Also recite the **Five Phases Earthly Measure Spell**—the five phases in sequence, metal subduing wood, water extinguishing fire, the **copper-mouthed, iron-tongued** decree. Afterward, observe one day of abstinence.\n\n**Eleventh Method:** Throughout the year, on **Middle Element** days, arrange seven mirrors in a row, spanning eighteen inches wide, to inspect your inner spirit. If one mirror lacks your reflection, it means your spirit is deficient—swallow the **Soul-Settling, Spirit-Subduing Talisman**. Then walk the **Middle Element General’s *Yubu* Steps** three times and recite the **Earthly Measure Blessing to Parents** once. **Note:** *\"The five [senses] arise from parents, and I endure the mundane world.\"* (Two talismans: **Soul-Settling Talisman**, **Spirit-Subduing Talisman**.)\n\n**Twelfth Method:** Select **Middle Element** or **Jiazi** days within the same decan, choosing your own **birthday**, and inscribe three talismans to wear, overcoming the **Nine Calamities and Eight Hardships**, along with the **Upper, Middle, and Lower Element Talismans**. (The **Upper Element Talisman**, **Middle Element Talisman**)\n\n「Inspect whether there are seven **spirits** (*qìpò*). If one lacks the reflection of the **Middle Element Spirit** in a mirror, it is said that the spirit is insufficient—then swallow the **Soul-Settling, Spirit-Subduing Talisman**. Upon completion, walk the **Middle Element General’s *Yubu* Steps** three times and recite the **Earthly Measure Blessing to Parents** once.\n\n**Note:** *\"The five [senses] arise from parents, and I endure the mundane world.\"* (Two talismans: **Soul-Settling Talisman**, **Spirit-Subduing Talisman**.)\n\n**Twelfth Method:** Select **Middle Element** or **Jiazi** days within the same decan, choosing your own **birthday**, and inscribe three talismans to wear, overcoming the **Nine Calamities and Eight Hardships**, along with the **Upper, Middle, and Lower Element Talismans**. (The **Upper Element Talisman**, **Middle Element Talisman**,)\n\n**Thirteenth Method:** For those who constantly guard their bodies and protect their families, after morning practice, retain the three generals of the **Middle, Upper, and Lower Elements** within the heart and kidneys, constantly using them to shield and safeguard—this is called **guarding the body**. To aid others, at the appropriate time, retain [the talismans] for a certain state, county, village, or household, encircling and patrolling the premises of a certain family, driving away malevolent and wicked crowds, and warding over the body of a certain kinsman. This follows the **Thirteen Precepts of the Holy Sovereign to the Heavenly Master**, known as the **constant retention method**.\n\n**Fourteenth Method:** For entering mountains, waters, or fires, or crossing rivers, before leaving home, over two or three days, walk the **Upper, Middle, and Lower Element *Yubu* Steps**, each three times. Then declare: *\"The Heavenly One has nurtured me, and the Earthly One has formed me. Certain [name], wearing this talisman, now unites with it. Daoist immortals aid me, and the jade maidens guard my form. The five colors transform—yellow, white, red, black, and blue—twenty-eight constellations merge into the **Purple Court**. The talisman repels disaster, granting blessings and longevity.\"* **As it is decreed, so it shall be done.** **Note:** Talismans are worn on the left for men and right for women after use.\n\n**Fifteenth Method:** For entering mountains, waters, or fires, or crossing rivers, before embarking, twist the **Mountain King Ghost’s *Ghost Swords*** or the **Beastly Eyes and Thieves’ *Sword Supports***. The Heavenly Master said: *\"I follow the teachings of the Primordial Master and the Holy Sovereign. When entering mountains, twist the Mountain King Ghost’s *Ghost Swords* or the Beastly Eyes. When entering seas or rivers, twist the Sea God’s Eyes. When entering battlefields, twist the *Ghost Swords* of the multitude.\"* (Two talismans: **Crossing Rivers Talisman**, **Entering Waters and Fires Talisman**.)\n\nDeclare: *\"Bow-bow, meet-meet, River Lord leads me forward, splitting the **snake-dragon** (*jiāolóng*). All evils perish by the Heavenly Emperor’s decree.\"* **As it is decreed, so it shall be done.**\n\n(Three talismans: **Entering Water and Fire Talisman**, **Entering Mountains Talisman**, **Nighttime Mountain Entry Talisman**—to be worn.)\n\nDeclare: *\"The shadow of **Hengshan**, the sunward face of **Taishan**. Spirits and demons do not arise; venomous serpents lie hidden. Tigers and wolves, seeing me, are all struck with terror. There is one surnamed Li, named Ear; fierce tigers, seeing him, break their fangs and snap their teeth; venomous serpents, seeing him, cannot coil.\"* **As it is decreed, so it shall be done.**\n\nTwist the **Preceptor’s Sword Support** (*Dūjiàn Guānmiào*).\n\n**Fifteenth [Method]:** To desire a single body and one household free from illness.\nConstantly, on the proper days of the solar year, tread the **Three Elemental Generals’ Three-Grade Halters** (*Sān Yuán Jiāngjūn Sān Děng Gěng*), beginning with the **Central Elemental General** (*Zhōng Yuán*), then proceeding to the **Upper Elemental General** (*Shàng Yuán*), and finally the **Lower Elemental General** (*Xià Yuán*).\n**Note:** Since one is born under the Central Elemental General, the halter-treading begins with the Central Elemental General and ends upon completing the **Preceptor’s Sword Support** (*Dūjiàn Guānmiào*), the **Grand Ghost’s Eye** (*Dūguǐ Mù*), and the **Three Teachers’ Halters** (*Sān Shī Děng*), concluding with the recitation of the **Earth Chronicle Talisman** (*Dì Jì Zhòu*) eighteen times. After the incantation, recite the **Heavenly Halter Vow** (*Tiān Gěng Zhòu*) twelve times. Then complete the **Grand Halter** and **Grand Heart** incantations.\n**Note:** The **Grand Halter** (*Dà Dūjiàn Guānmiào*) is inscribed on the left palm in a horizontal manner, resembling a clenched fist. The **Grand Heart** (*Dūxīn*) is inscribed beneath the first fingernail of the left hand. Twist them swiftly—these are the **inner incantations of myriad transformations** (*Qiān Biàn Wàn Huà Zhī Nèi Jué*). Swallow one talisman. For a year, one’s body and household—whether one or many—shall remain free from illness. Each person swallows one talisman and thus attains a year without affliction.\n\nOn the **First Day of the First Month**, ingest this talisman once.\nDeclare: *\"The **Supreme Venerable Lord** (*Tàishàng Lǎojūn*), the One who begets and receives his ministers.\nSwiftly binding and dispatching spirits, banishing them a thousand leagues away.\nThose who confront me shall die; those who gaze upon me shall perish.\nSwiftly, as the **Supreme Venerable Lord’s Female Green Dao/Way’s Heavenly Decree** (*Nǚ Qīng Xuán Dū Lǜ Lìng*).\"*\n\n**Sixteenth [Method]:** Constantly on the **Six Wu Days** (*Liù Wù Rì*—Wuzi, Wuchen, Wuyin, Wushen, Wuxu, and Wuwu), gather the **Six Wu Upper Soils** (*Liù Wù Shàng Tǔ*), shaping them into cakes.\nThree inches and two *fēn* in length, three *fēn* in thickness, dried in the shade for several days.\nThen tread the **Central, Upper, and Lower Three Elemental Generals’ Halters** (*Zhōng-Shàng-Xià Sān Yuán Jiāngjūn Gěng*), each three times.\nAfterward, recite the **Earth Chronicle Talisman** (*Dì Jì Zhòu*) eighteen times.\nUpon completion, attach these cakes to both soles of the feet.\nTreading water becomes like walking on land; one forever crosses rivers and seas.\nThe **Avoiding Calamity Halter** (*Bì Nàn Dé Jué*) is inscribed beneath the left foot, along with the **Sea God’s Eye** (*Hǎishén Mù*) and **River God’s Eye** (*Héshén Mù*), etc., with vermilion ink. These soil cakes are tied to the **Earth Heart God’s Eye** (*Dìxīn Dìshén Mù*), thus prohibiting all manner of spirits from the rivers, seas, and lakes—treading water as if on land.\n\nThis method is most wondrous; keep it secret.\nWithin the **Upper Elemental General’s Central Division** (*Shàng Yuán Zhōng Bù*), only the **Central Division’s Dao/Way** (*Zhōng Bù Fǎ*) is accessible to mortals, allowing the gods to subdue demons and save the people in their pursuit of immortality. It is a **true and wondrous method** (*Rù Zhēn Miào Yī Fǎ*) found in the Central Division.\n\n**Upper Elemental General’s Lower Division Halter Diagram**\nNext, the **Upper Elemental General’s Lower Division** (*Shàng Yuán Xià Bù Jiāngjūn*), surnamed **Xu** (*Xú*), named **Kang** (*Kāng*).\nHis stature measures **five hundred million zhang** (*Wǔ Qiān Wàn Zhàng*). He leads...\n\n---\n\n**Annotations:**\n*《金锁流珠》* (Jīn Suǒ Liú Zhū) – *\"Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl\"* (a Daoist scripture)\n\n---\n\n**Commentary:**\nThe *Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl* omits the character **领** (*lǐng*, \"command\").\nThe **Five Rigid Dao-Functionaries** (*Wǔ Gāng Shén Gōngcáo*)—one person, surname **Wēn**, given name **Shū**.\n*Annotation:* According to *Liú Zhū*, only **\"Dao-Functionary\"** (*Gōng*) is mentioned, omitting **\"person\"** (*rén*). Thus, **\"surname Wēn, given name Shū\"** refers to this single individual alone.\nThe phrase **\"hundred thousand million layers of men in red robes\"** (*Bǎi Qiān Wàn Chéng Rén Zhī Chìyī*) should be interpreted as soldiers, not Dao-Functionaries.\n\nAccording to the **Later Sage Emperor’s** (*Hòu Shèngjūn*) instruction to the **Celestial Master** (*Tiānshī*):\n- **Upper Elemental General’s Upper Division** (*Shàng Yuán Shàng Bù*)—one general, **Five Rigid Dao-Functionaries** nine in number, **Administrative Dao-Functionaries** nine thousand.\n- **Upper Elemental General’s Central Division** (*Shàng Yuán Zhōng Bù*)—one general, **Five Rigid Dao-Functionaries** seven in number, **Administrative Dao-Functionaries** seven thousand.\n- **Upper Elemental General’s Lower Division** (*Shàng Yuán Xià Bù*)—one general, **Five Rigid Dao-Functionaries** five in number, **Administrative Dao-Functionaries** five thousand, with soldiers numbering **hundreds of thousands of layers** (*Bǎi Qiān Wàn Chéng*).\n\nNone know their exact multitude.\nThis is the **Later Sage Emperor’s** revelation—**true numbers**—where the **Five Rigid Dao-Functionaries** of the **Upper Elemental** are fixed at nine.\nThis applies to **Upper True Ones** (*Shàng Zhēn*), **Middle True Ones** (*Zhōng Zhēn*), **Lower True Ones** (*Xià Zhēn*), and **Upper Immortals** (*Shàng Xiān*).\n\nThe **\"hundred thousand million layers\"** refers to multitudes of **red-robed, red-headbanded** (*Chìyī Chìfù*) soldiers.\n\nThe **Grand General** holds in his right hand the **Jade Yang Scepter** (*Yù Yáng Zhī Jié*), and at his waist, the **Dragon Spring Mo-Ye Sword** (*Lóng Yuān Mòyé Zhī Jiàn*).\n*Annotation:* According to *The Transmission of the Laozi*, it is the **\"Sword that Beheads Evil\"** (*Zhǎn Xié Zhī Jiàn*).\n\nThe **Great Luo Heaven’s** (*Dà Luò Tiān*) **Upper Inspection Ropes** (*Shàng Yóu Jiǎn*) descend into the **human heart-mind** (*rén xīnzhōng*), entering the **right kidney** (*yòu shèn*).\n**Cultivation through contemplation** (*Cúnsī*) emerges from the **right eyebrow’s Heavenly Gate** (*Yántmén Zhōng*).\nAll methods follow those previously established for the **Upper and Central Division Generals**.\n\nThe **Later Sage Emperor** instructs the **Celestial Master** on the **Method of Extracting the Residence and Ascending to Heaven** (*Bá Zhái Shēng Tiān Jué*), stating:\nThese are the **Three Elemental Generals** (*Sān Yuán Dà Jiāngjūn*)—the **three divisions of the Upper Elemental** (*Shàng Yuán Sān Bù*).\nThey are also the **Celestial Sovereign’s** (*Tiān Huáng*) **decree**, appointed by the **Former Sage Dao-Lord** (*Xiān Shèng Dà Dàojūn*), to fill the **Upper Immortal General’s** (*Shàng Xiān Jiāngjūn*) position.\n*Annotation:* *Liú Zhū* states: These are the **Three Sovereigns** (*Sān Huáng*) of antiquity, not the **Taiyi Era** (*Tàiyì Shídài*).\n\nThe **Three Divisions of the Middle Elemental** (*Zhōng Yuán Sān Bù*) were established by the **Later Sage Emperor**.\nThe **Lower Division Xu General’s** (*Xià Bù Xú Jiāngjūn*) methods of cultivation and practice follow those of the **Upper and Central Divisions**.\nGenerally, the **Lower Division** governs **earth-water-heart-mind** (*dìshuǐ xīn xíng*) affairs—all must be invoked through **awareness** (*qǐniàn*), which constitutes the method.\nEach governs **earth-water spirits, dragons, and ghosts** (*dìshuǐ shénlóng guǐ*).\n\nThe **Later Sage Emperor** instructs the **Young Lords of the Four Directions** (*Fāng Zhǔ Tóngjūn*) and the **Great True Ones** (*Dà Zhēn Yán*):\n\nThe **Three Divisions of the Upper Elemental General’s** (*Shàng Yuán Sān Bù Jiāngjūn*) **Step Ropes** (*Bù Jiāng*) are used to **rectify and subdue the Three Souls** (*Sān Hún*), while the **North Dipper Step Ropes** (*Běi Dǒu Bù Jiāng*)—\n*Annotation:* This is the **Flying Step of Heavenly Ropes** (*Fēibù Tiāngāng*).\n—are used to **stabilize the Seven Spirits** (*Qī Pò*).\n*Annotation:* Regardless of **Heavenly Steel** (*Tiāngāng*) or **Earthly Ropes** (*Dìjì*) methods, all conform to the **Seven Spirits’** regulation.\n\nThose who study the **Dao of Immortality** (*Xiān Dào*) must first **rectify the Three Souls**, then **subdue the Seven Spirits**, establishing the foundation for the method and entering the **Gate of Immortality**.

They oversee the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, regulating all things. In the lower realm, humans, gods, dragons, ghosts, and all malevolent forces—all fear and submit, daring not to resist.\n\nThe Emperor of the Golden Summit of Great Peace (Tàipíng Jīnquè Dìjūn) thus revealed the Nine Ranks to the Heavenly Master, entrusting them to the worthy Daoist children, lest they be misled.\n\nThe Venerable Lord said:\n*The Seven Stars, when visible, govern the birth and death of all things.*\n*Annotation:* All things between Heaven and Earth—those subject to life and death—are governed by the Seven Stars of the Big Dipper.\n*All matters of birth and death are directed by these seven officials, not by other celestial departments.*\n*There is nothing that does not belong to them.*\n\nOnly those with a Daoist heart, filial piety, and devotion to their master may orally transmit the Nine Names. If not a worthy person, one must not recklessly spread them. Misuse will bring calamity upon the seven ancestral generations—not just oneself.\n\nThe eighth star is named **Tàishàng Zhēnjūn** (Great Supreme True Lord), also called **Tóngyù** (Same as Jade), **Tiāngǔ** (Celestial Pivot), and **Jìyìng Tiānpéng** (Subduing Response, Heavenly Phoenix). It governs the **Kàn Palace** below, steadfastly presiding over **Jìzhōu** (Sufficiency State). In Heaven, it serves as the **Outer Department**, hidden in form and unseen, overseeing the affairs of the Water Official.\n\nThe ninth star is **Gāoshàng Yùhuángdì** (Highest Supreme Jade Emperor).\n*Annotation:* The Highest Supreme Jade Emperor is the sovereign of the Nine Officials of the Northern Dipper. He is not the **Great Dao Supreme Jade Emperor**. Instead, he is a **Celestial Overseer**, inspecting the Seven Governments and Nine Palaces, along with all ministers and clerks, and the myriad soldiers. The Highest Supreme Jade Emperor judges all matters within the **Ten Thousand Symbols and Star Officials**, prohibiting unjust killings and warfare. He also oversees all beings, commanding their registration and classification. Externally, he foreknows the times of life and death, reporting them to the **Great Dao Supreme Jade Emperor** without error. Internally, he is named **□** (missing), **Tiānzhèng** (Celestial Rectification), **Shètí** (Concealing Submission), and **Yìyīn** (Augmenting Darkness). His affairs remain unseen in the human world, but if a mortal witnesses him, their lifespan extends by three hundred years.\n\nThe **Later Sage Emperor** instructed the **Twenty-Nine True Persons of Xuānzhōu**:\n*\"To know the inner Dao, one must first recite the Nine Names of the Central Dipper.\"*\n*Annotation:* This refers to the Northern Dipper of today. At the time, people did not recognize it, calling it the Northern Dipper, but it is the Central Dipper. The **Supreme Venerable Lord** taught, also calling it the Central Dipper, commanding seekers of the Dao to know it themselves without instructing the ignorant masses. Thus, one may be removed from the **Death Register** and granted a **Heavenly Birth Name**. Keep it in mind and embody it:\n*Annotation:* Keep the names of the two august stars in mind, internalizing them into the five viscera, reciting them day and night without ceasing.\n\nThe **clothing** is formed by the **One Dipper and Two Dippers**. After fourteen years, one attains longevity. The **method** was transmitted to the Twenty-Nine True Persons:\n*\"On your natal day, or on days of the **Jiǎzǐ** (Gengshen) cycle—at dawn or dusk—\n*Annotation:* The best time is **midday** (upper), followed by **sì hour** (second), **yǒu hour** (mid), and **night hài hour** (upper), **zǐ hour** (middle), and **chǒu hour** (lower).\n—recite the **One Dipper and Two Dippers** fully. Then, through the **Seven Dippers** (missing characters), each recitation must be completed. Afterward, recite the **Earthly Records and Heavenly Halter Charms** once more, and the practice is finished. Those who attain this will have no calamities for one year, no death for two years, become an **Earthly Immortal** in three years, enter **Non-Death** in four, and by five years, their power will be thoroughly attuned to Heaven and Earth, enabling them to rescue beings according to their will. By six years, their **spiritual penetration and longevity** will be self-sufficient—this is the verified power. Do not act recklessly; secrecy brings fortune, while disclosure brings misfortune.\n*Annotation:* This is the **Supreme Later Sage’s True Speech instruction**; do not act rashly.\n\nThe **Supreme Venerable Lord** said:\n*\"When forming the **One Dipper and Two Dippers**, one must first grasp the original incantation of the seven stars, then internalize and embody them.\n*Annotation:* **Embodying** means keeping the Dipper’s leader or, at the proper time, using the **left shoulder as □**, or **□**, the **mind as □**, or the **hand as □**—this is called **embodying and applying**. Only when the Dipper is formed does it have divine efficacy, allowing one to send forth [spiritual agents].\n\nFrom the **One Dipper** to the **Seven Dippers**, all follow the original, correct incantation, which must be grasped and applied. The **first □ star’s incantation** is on the **second phalanx of the left second finger**. The **second □ star’s incantation** is on the **first phalanx of the left second finger**. The **third □ star’s incantation** is on the **first phalanx of the left third finger**. The **fourth □ star’s incantation** is on the **second phalanx of the left third finger**. The **fifth □ star’s incantation** is on the **second phalanx of the left fourth finger**. The **sixth □ star’s incantation** is on the **second phalanx of the left fifth finger**. The **seventh □ star’s incantation** is on the **first phalanx of the left fifth finger**.\n\nThe **Supreme Venerable Lord** said:\n*\"When forming the Dipper’s clothing, one must first know the seven stars’ original incantations. Only then can one internalize and embody them on the body, thus attaining spiritual communion. To make the Dipper’s power manifest, grasp this incantation, traversing all seven star-forms. Within the Dipper, the two august imperial stars, the three consorts, and the two ladies—along with the two beloved daughters and great officials—must be reverently honored. They register your **Heavenly Birth Name** above and remove you from the **Death Register** below.\n\nLater scholars, if they practice filial piety, reverence for their master, and offer gold, jade, and silk to the **master’s sacred chamber**, may request this incantation beneath the **precious seat**. Only then should they follow the *Liúzhū* [scroll] to internalize and apply it, thus entering the **Immortal Register** and having their names inscribed on the **Jade Ledger**.\n\nThe officials of the Northern Dipper, along with the **Record-Keepers and Registrars**, oversee the **Green Tablets of Destiny** and the **Black Registers of Sentences**. These are all achieved through Daoist power, using the **scribed incantations**. Once applied, the body and mind commune with the **Heavenly and Earthly Spirits**, and their spiritual power becomes effective. If one does not know this incantation, even if they follow the scripture for a hundred years, their practice will yield no benefit.\n\nWhen this method is obtained and applied, one understands its essence. In one year, they will attain spiritual communion; in two years, they will avoid death and warfare; in three years, they will become an **Immortal Official**. In fourteen years, if they wish to ascend, they ascend; if they wish to remain, they remain. The **Emperor of the Golden Summit of Great Peace** and the **Later Sage Emperor** will appoint them as **Worldly Immortal Officials**, commanding their departures and residences. This method must be kept secret—never transmit it to the unworthy. It is passed down only every seven hundred years, with each transmission limited to three persons. Beyond this, the master will face **Great Judgment**, descend from the **Immortal Rank**, and the disciple, if they steal and misuse it, will suffer **self-annihilation and clan destruction**. This is strictly forbidden.\n\nThe **Later Sage Emperor** instructed **Zhang the Heavenly Master**:\n*\"To practice the **Heavenly Halter and Dipper Clothing**, forming the sequence **One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven**, and using it to benefit oneself, aid the nation, stabilize the family, and rescue those in urgent distress from **war, epidemics, fire, and water calamities**, one must first know the **hand incantations**. This is the true power of attaining the Dao.\"*\n\nWhen encountering malevolent and wicked individuals approaching,\n\n*Note: When they are still distant (heard but not seen), one may preserve [the power of] one or two *dou*—when they are near (seen), it is too late to preserve any more. Once the* dou *is formed, swiftly pinch the incantation and point at them, then flee to a wider space where an ancient immortal might dwell. There, preserve the* dou *again to halt their killing intent. Then pinch the patterns of one star, two stars, up to seven stars—this suffices.\n\nWith urgency, align with the *Clothing of the Dipper*, using the left hand to preserve the *Kui* and *Wei* to subdue [them]. Stand firm and they will submit on their own. Rest for a short while, then depart swiftly. Later, in a wider place with few people, pinch the incantation, preserve the *dou* again, and the malevolent and demonic will retreat in fear, unwilling to leave—if they refuse, they will die. This method is highly effective; do not practice it recklessly—be cautious.\n\nFurthermore, the Sage instructed **Wang Jun**:\n*\"The incantation states: One* dou *preserves the soul, two* dou *preserve the spirit, three* dou *preserve the essence, four* dou *preserve the body.\n*Note: For grave crimes, trust in the method to act accordingly.*\nFive* dou *drink blood—\n*Note: Drinking blood is another name for the prohibitive incantation.*\nSix* dou *execute the spirit—\n*Note: This is another name for the judgment of one’s soul and spirit.*\nSeven* dou *halt the body.\n*Note: If halting does not work, it means beheading—halt is another name for beheading.*\n\nIt is also said: Those who constantly practice and refine themselves—preserving one* dou *stabilizes the soul, two* dou *refines the spirit, three* dou *harmonizes the essence,\n*Note: Essence is the refined substance of* qi*, the vital force of the form and meridians, moving through* qi*.*\nFour* dou *heals illness, five* dou *repels bandits and strengthens the body, six* dou *invokes divine spirits to protect, seven* dou *completes the Dao and attains divine communion. Practicing this for seven years grants the title of *Tian Zhen* [Celestial Purity].\n*Note: This means entering the rank of Tian Zhen, though one has not yet attained the method of ascending. After fourteen years, one ascends to heaven, receiving cloud dragons, phoenixes, cranes, music, and dancing. Immortal boys and girls, consorts, and guards—thousands and tens of thousands descend to welcome [them], or the entire family is lifted from their home to depart.*\n\n**Laozi** said: *\"Those who cultivate the Dao wish to have the North Dipper govern their lifespan and attain immortality. The incantation and method are found in the *Left Elbow Classic*.\n*Note: The Classic is the sacred text of the Daoist scriptures, containing the essential seals and incantation patterns. The talismans are used internally, and the secret method is kept in a short silk pouch tied to the elbow.*\n\nThe method of the *Heavenly Halter* is detailed in the Classic diagram.\n*Note: The Halter is the Heavenly Halter, the Memoir is the Earthly Memoir.*\n\n**Laozi** said: *\"Those who practice must always preserve the Dipper near their body. At night, meditate on the Dipper above the head, as if it envelops the body. By day, visualize it suspended over the forehead—a small, square *dou* of an inch.\n*Note: By day, visualize it hanging over the forehead, shifting with each hour. It is one inch long, then cycles downward in the center of the heavens, beside the *Yintang* [third eye], so that malevolent spirits see it and are constantly in awe, subduing their poisonous hearts.*\n\nRecite the invocation:\n*'Forehead-suspended Seven Stars—malevolent ghosts flee in terror.\nIf any dare to harm, they will be beheaded upon turning back.\nSwiftly, as the law commands.'*\n\n**Explanation of the Four-Dou Diagram Method**\n**Laozi** said: *\"The Four-Dou Diagram is the formation of four* dou *across the body. Lift the left hand to the forehead in the shape of a* dou*, curving upward as in the diagram. The palm supports [the star] □, the left elbow [supports] □, the left shoulder to the chest [supports] □, the heart [supports] □, the left inner ankle [seen] from the left inner groin [supports] □, the left knee [supports] □, and the left inner ankle [supports] □. The right side mirrors the left, each forming a* dou *shape.*\n\nAgain, reverse the preservation—counting upward from the left inner ankle as *Kui* to the seven stars suffices. This is the method of the Four-Dou.\n*Note: Laozi’s method calls the front* dou *the Yang Dipper, the back the Yin Dipper, with two Dipper formations on each side—thus, the Four-Dou. This Dipper dispels ten thousand calamities. The Four-Dou can eliminate the Four Killers, extinguishing malevolent disasters, warfare, ghosts, and demons, instantly dissolving them.\n*Note: Dissolving warfare and ghosts means subduing their malevolent influence.*\n\nThe Classic states: Seven* dou *dispel celestial calamities and the five departments of malevolent ghosts. Four* dou *dispel earthly disasters and killings, including the Year Pillar, Earthly Officials, and the four departments of hellish ghosts. Five* dou *can dispel the five phases—calamities of metal, water, wood, fire, and earth.\n\nAll are preserved in two ranks, subduing malevolent and wicked beings—\n*Note: Malevolent beings of the upper ranks.*\nFive armies, plagues, poisons, snakes, insects, and beasts. The incantation lies in the Five Knife Supports.\n*Note: The Five Knife Supports correspond to the metal, water, wood, fire, and earth phases, all contained within the palm incantation.*\n\n**Explanation of the Dipper-Clothing Alignment Method**\n**Laozi** said: *\"The Clothing of the Dipper is like wearing the Dipper as garments, with left and right sides—men use the left.\n*Note: Men begin with the left side, women with the right.*\n\nFor men practicing the Dipper-Clothing Alignment, first form the Four-Dou Diagram, then pinch the incantation,\n*Note: The General Supervisory Incantation.*\nAfter a short while, preserve [the star] □ on the left shoulder to the chest,\n*Note: Referring to the diagram, the left shoulder to the chest, near the nape, is called the chest-below-head, or more accurately, the axillary chamber. This is named the left and right axillary chambers.*\n□ resides in the heart, □ in the left foot’s *Fusu* [hidden mouse point], □ in the left wrist, □ in the left palm.\n*Note: The five fingers of the hand are the great palm—grasp them firmly and apply accordingly.\"*\n\n「□ star resides above the left knee, □ star resides to the right of the left ankle’s inner malleolus.\nWomen’s practice mirrors this, storing and invoking with the left side first.\n\nThis method is to be practiced by both men and women constantly, to avert calamity, disaster, and misfortune.\nThose cultivating must first employ the Dipper-Clothing Alignment if they wish to repel malevolence.\nFurthermore, cultivators entering deep mountains or valleys, fearing snakes and tigers, should first store [the stars] as a priority.\n\nThe Later Sage Emperor declared: This method originates from the Three Element Generals’ stored deployment, extending to the Seven Dou.\nFrom Seven Dou to Four Dou.\nFrom Four Dou to Dipper-Clothing Alignment, from Dipper-Clothing Alignment to Standing-Clothing Alignment—\n*Note: This method is identical to Dipper-Clothing Alignment.*\nStanding-Clothing Alignment: face south while standing; men turn to face east, women to face west.\nThe diagram names but does not depict [the stars], so it is omitted accordingly. This is absent in *The Flowing Pearl* [text].\n\nProceeding to Sleep-Clothing Alignment, then to Sitting-Clothing Alignment.\nOnce seated, store and deploy the incantation to strike away malevolent blades, and they will self-dissolve.\nThe Later Sage Emperor again admonished the Celestial Master: This method must not be recklessly transmitted, for reckless transmission invites misfortune and blame. Keep it secret—this is the way of the True Person.\n\nLaozi imparted this method to aid Yellow Emperor in subduing Chi You, to help Yu control the floods, and to assist the Zhou in overthrowing Jie—all to vanquish evil and save the people, guiding them toward goodness.\nLaozi often pondered the undiscriminating mix of good and evil, thus commanding rulers and subjects to subdue evil and embrace goodness, to pacify the common folk, to uphold the Dao of Heaven, and to aid the nation’s prosperity, ensuring personal safety and benefiting longevity.\n*Note: Historical records show that successive generations inherited this as Heaven’s mandate. Heavenly messengers and divine men descended to impart martial arts, which were then deployed accordingly.*\nScripture states: Each generation’s figures were Laozi’s incarnations, though their names changed with the times, unknown to the populace as the same being adapting names to the era.\n\n**Explanation of the Standing-Clothing Alignment Storage Method Diagram**\nLaozi said: Standing-Clothing Alignment is to stand and immediately complete [the alignment].\nAncient True Persons practiced this text and diagram, mastering the incantations passed orally by their teachers. With refined cultivation, standing and thinking, speaking in unison with the heart—nothing is unattained.\n\n**Explanation of the Sleep-Clothing Alignment Storage Method Diagram**\nLaozi instructed the Western Mountain Hu King, Da Li: *\"I have obtained Heaven’s method, teaching me to sleep in the Dipper [formation], summoning countless armies to encircle my teacher below, yet I endured their calamities unharmed while my teacher was seized for sustenance.\nMy teacher feared my Heavenly troops, so I saved him.\nThe Hu King, desperate, sought Laozi.\nWith a single thought, I lay in the Dipper formation for a short while, and countless armies encircled my teacher’s forces.\nMy teacher, sensing my intent, retreated and dispersed.\nMy teacher—\n*Note: My teacher refers to Laozi’s disciple, who assumed a transformed guise to assist in subjugating the Hu, then descended from Heaven.*\n—led Heaven’s armies to slaughter the Hu King’s forces.\nThe Hu King, terrified, turned to Laozi for salvation, seeking life with no hesitation.\nLaozi immediately stretched out his feet on the bed, lying in the Four Dou formation to rescue him.\nThus, the Hu King’s great sovereign prostrated himself, begging for Daoist instruction, abandoning his throne to follow the Way, adopting the Sleep-Dipper method.\nLaozi cursed the Hu King: ‘My multitude—hundreds of thousands—all wish to devour your kin to satiate themselves.\nNow, a lofty Celestial True Immortal exists, teaching you the Sleep-Dipper method to repel my Heavenly troops.\nBecause I cannot yet consume you, I will return later to devour your people.’\nHaving spoken, he led his divine armies back to Heaven.\nThe Hu King then struck his head against the ground, beating himself with stones, beseeching the Celestial True Immortal to teach his subjects the Sleep-Dipper method.\nThus, Laozi composed *Two Hundred and Fifty Precepts*, instructing the Hu King.\nThe King adhered without deviation, and my teacher did not descend again.\nAfter several months, the Hu King announced to his followers: ‘This old Daoist possesses the Sleep-Dipper method, capable of severing my teacher’s descent. My people must learn it together.’\nThus, the Hu King led his followers in three prostrations before Laozi, kneeling to ask: ‘My subjects, unprotected by Daoists, are all slain and devoured by the Heavenly Demon, my teacher.\nI now kneel to receive this method to repel these malevolent spirits and ghosts who prey on us.’\nAt this, Laozi imparted the Sleep-Dipper method. The Hu King cultivated it with unwavering focus, further requesting advanced Daoist teachings, eventually attaining true Buddhahood—all through the Sleep-Dipper method, gaining the Obscure Immortal [status].\n*Note: Obscure Immortal refers to Buddhahood.*\n\n**Sleep-Dipper Method**\nWith the right hand, cover the head and grasp □.\n□ resides at the left elbow, □ at the left chest—\nthe left side of the chest, specifically.\n□ resides in the heart, □ in the navel, with the right hand pressed over the navel.\n*Note: The navel must not receive the star’s qi directly, so the right hand covers it.*\nStore the star on the back of the hand as prescribed; practice this nightly while lying down, and eternal life will endure.\n□ resides at the left knee, □ at the left ankle’s inner malleolus.\nBoth sides are stored and invoked identically.\nAdditionally, the right side is used similarly: with the left hand’s □, store □ at the right shoulder, □ in the chest, □ in the heart, proceeding in the same manner.\nFor external coverage of the body, the left side begins with the Foot-Kua star, extending upward to the head.\nNext, arrange □, □, □, □, □, □, □—the seven □ stars’ sequence.\nThe right side begins with the Head-Kua star, extending downward to the foot.\n*Note: This follows the same principle as above.*\n\n**Explanation of the Sitting-Clothing Alignment Storage Method Diagram**\nLaozi said: Sitting-Clothing Alignment involves calculating and storing the Dipper stars on both sides.»\n\nWith hands joined in sitting posture, store □ at the left shoulder, □ in both hands, □ one inch below the left kidney.\nThis is the method of storing on the clothing.\n\n□ at the left elbow, □ above the knee, □ three inches below the left knee, □ at the right outer ankle.\nThe right side’s storage follows the same principle.\n\n**Explanation of the Diagram for the Heavenly Pillar Warrior Striking Malevolent Enemies**\nThe Most High Laozi says:\n*\"In the world, those who study the Dao may be among people, in the mountains and forests, or on the roads. Suddenly, malevolent bandits or officials may arise to harm them. Close the qi, grasp the incantation, and confront the evil foe. The scripture says: ‘From afar, strike their dwellings.’ The bandits will then cower and flee. This is also an avoidance.\n\n*Note: Because of the Dao’s compassionate way, they are made to cower and retreat. If they do not cower, strike them until the bandits are defeated and dead—this is the proof of success. If they do not cower, strike them until the utmost defeat, until death is complete.*\n\n*First, close the qi and grasp the incantation.\n*Note: The incantation is the ‘Sword-Support Incantation,’ named the ‘Sword-Support Incantation for Malevolent Ghost-Bandits.’ Store the malevolent ghost-bandits as previously described in the upper robe.*\n\n*For their dwellings, arrange the Four Dipper Stars to contain malevolent ghostly spirits, preventing them from moving east, west, south, north, or flying above and below. Oneself forms the Four Dipper Stars aligned with the clothing, sealing [them]—\n*Note: The front is the mouth, the back is the posterior orifice, releasing the qi.*\n\nThen, write the qi, crossing hands before the chest to form a bow-and-arrow.\n*Note: For men, the left elbow is the crossbow, the right the bow—both are stored and verified in use.*\n\nDraw and hold the arrow to shoot. Then, leap over the ground three times, shouting, ‘Shout! Shout!’ The malevolent bandits will immediately fall.\n*Note: The scripture says: ‘If you spread the clothing and step.’*\n\n*From the ‘Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl’ Scroll, Volume Ten*\n*From the ‘Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl’ Scroll, Volume Eleven*\"*\n\nThe **Grand Sovereign of the Dao** of the Central Realm, **Master Zaiwang Fangping**, **Zhang Daoling**, **Zhao Sheng**, **Wang Chang**, **Lord of the Command of Life**, **Li Zhongfu**, **Mao Ying**, **Xu Yufu**, and others—these are the successive compilers and authors.\n\nThe **Daoist Immortal Li Chunfeng** annotated and explained the **Hidden Names of the Celestial Lords**, where the **Most High Laozi** declared:\n\n*\"Those who bear the hidden true names of the Celestial Lords are all the ancestral names and ancestral titles of the Nine Heavenly Emperors. They must always be worn on the left elbow, following the Earthly Measures and the Celestial Ropes. As for the hidden names and hidden titles of the Nine Earthly [realms], they must all be carried in a single pouch.*\n\n*Once the talismans for flight and earthly movement are worn, recite the eighteen chapters of incantations, manipulate the spells according to the method, and then perform the Great Dao.*\n\n*The later Sage Emperor instructed the Celestial Master Zhang Daoling, saying:\n\n*'If you wish to master the essential techniques of the Dao of Immortality, you must wear the true names and hidden titles of the Great Celestial Demons. The Three Elements, Five Stars, Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, the Twenty-Eight Constellations, Thirty-Five Star Officials, Six Jia [Stems], Nine Provinces, Five Sacred Mountains, Four Great Rivers, the Eight Directions, Ten Thousand Nations, and the myriad mountains and waters—all their true names and hidden titles must be kept upon your person, unseen by others. Your entire life’s record of sins and transgressions shall be sealed by their reverence for you, and they shall all vouch for your name. They shall speak only of your hidden virtues, never of your manifest crimes. The same applies to the Lords of Life and the Lords of Records.\"*\n\nThe method of wearing the true hidden names has its own prescribed rites, found in the *Jīnsuǒ Liúzhū* [\"Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl\"] section.\n\nSpeaking of wearing the earthly hidden names, the Venerable Lord Lao said: On one’s natal day and on the Six Jia days, wearing them for cultivation is most efficacious. The celestial beings will proclaim one’s merits and vouch for one’s name, earning the reverence of the Highest Immortals—these are the true hidden names and true names.\n\nIn ancient times, the Yellow Emperor obtained the teachings of Guangchéng Jun, who instructed him to wear these nine earthly true hidden names. Wherever he passed, spirits and numinous beings would appear, bowing and escorting him, daring not to cause harm, and instead submitting to his command.\n\n*Note: In days past, Gāoqīu Zi suddenly entered the mountains, where he encountered a Daoist who gave him the true hidden names of the Nine Provinces and the sacred names of the Five Sacred Mountains. Wearing them on his person, Gāoqīu Zi abstained from meat for one hundred days, then began to travel with them.\n\nOne day, as he reached Xiányáng and the sun was setting, he suddenly saw forty-nine men in crimson robes and black caps coming to greet him. Gāoqīu Zi asked why, and they replied: \"Because you bear upon your person the true speech, hidden name, true name, surname, and lineage of [a certain] ancestor, we are compelled to serve you. We have come to pay our respects. We feared that the local earth deities and ancestral shrines might be unaware, so we now report this to them in advance, so that they may know the reason.\"\n\nThey then took their leave.*\n\n「Thus, the Later Emperor [常行蹑纪] often practiced the secret steps of the Dao, attaining ascension to the Cloud Celestial [天]. He further spoke of the Western Mountain’s Zhao Rui [赵芮], who for seven generations carried the hidden names of Heaven and Earth [天地之讳] and their sacred names [名], each lineage thus empowered to command ghosts and spirits [驱使鬼神], heal maladies [救人疾病], and accumulate merit [累代着功]. In total, over thirty individuals attained the Dao [得道者计三十余人], achieving longevity [得长生], or the methods of corpse dissolution [尸解之道], or the immortals dwelling in cave palaces [洞府之仙]. Only Zhao Rui’s seventh-generation descendant [赵升] ascended as a Celestial Immortal [天仙], rising in broad daylight [白日] with his entire household [拔宅], all lifted together [俱随身举].\n\nWhen it came to Sun Rui [孙芮], he was skilled in restraining *qi* [炁禁], but his excessive unlawful slaughter of ghosts and spirits [非法杀害鬼神太多] incurred the wrath of the condemned immortals [被谪仙], who decreed him to serve as a scribe in the Bureau of Examinations [考召书吏]. *注：today’s bureaucratic officials.*\n\nTwo thousand years later, he would finally attain the rank of Great Immortal [大仙]. *注：According to the *Nine Provinces Geographical Record* [九州地纪], the Western Mountain was once part of the ancient Jingzhou [古荆州], which is today’s Western Mountain, known as Hongzhou [洪州].*\n\n**Ascension by Household Removal [拔宅] to the Celestial Palace [上升天宫]**\nThe Most High Venerable Lord [太上老君] declared: *\"I received the primordial Dao’s true speech [元始真言] and orthodox teachings [正法], and the Most High Dao Lord [太上道君] vouched for my ascension. Through my mastery of subduing Heavenly Demons [天魔] and Earthly Spirits [地灵], I was able to achieve my body’s transformation and rise in daylight [白日上升]. Only by ascending alone [唯一身而上游] could I pay homage to the Celestial Lords [谒诸天] and worship the Most High Dao Lord [朝拜太上道君]. Afterward, I was permitted to worship the Primordial Heavenly Venerable One [元始天尊], yet I still could not attain ascension by household removal [不得拔宅上升].\"*\n\nNow, I have, with unwavering resolve [志心] and focused meditation [精思], compiled the sacred texts and secret keys [秘诀] of various Daoist teachings [众法经文], as well as the hidden scriptures and true speech of the Celestial Lords [诸天隐文真言]. Through this, I have grasped the essence of the Most High’s Golden Talisman [太上金箓之要], extracted from the myriad scriptures [众文中撰出], and achieved ascension by household removal [拔宅], whereby my entire family—men, women, and all—attained the Dao [得道], and even chickens and dogs ascended together [鸡犬一时俱升] to the Cloud Celestial [云天]. From that point onward, I began to manifest ascension by household removal.\n\n*注：Before this, there were no recorded instances of ascension by household removal. Those who prepared and ingested the elixir [将作药成服] would rise to the Cloud Celestial, their entire household lifted, even chickens and dogs attaining the same fate.*\n\nThe practice of ascension by household removal [拔宅上升] originated with the Most High Venerable Lord [太上老君]. *注：Before this, there were no recorded instances of ascension by household removal. Those who now attain it [今时得者] are quite common [往往有之], all practicing this method, numbering tens of households [计数十家], already present in the Celestial Courts [见在上天].*\n\nFamilies such as Li, Wang, Zhang, Xu, Peng, and Han [李王张许彭韩等数家] all ascended by household removal [俱以拔宅]. Li was the Later Sage Lord [后圣君], who in the Western Domain of Zhuqian [竺乾] country transformed the King of Hu into a Buddha [化胡王成佛]. Later, he established the Broad Benevolence Daoist Hall [拔广慈道场], where over a hundred rooms of his residence ascended together [宅院一百余间屋俱升]. Today, it is the Purple Micro Celestial Palace [紫微上宫], the former residence of the Later Sage Lord [后圣君旧宅].\n\nThe Later Sage Lord further bestowed upon his servants, chickens, and dogs [更添奴婢鸡犬], granting them ascension as well. *注：This is the Later Sage Lord’s vast compassion and profound mercy [大慈大悲]. His blessings extend to those who have accumulated great merit and achieved profound attainments [恩流赐言功，功大积着多者]. Thus, he permits even their wives, children, disciples, servants, chickens, and dogs [及妻子子弟子奴婢鸡犬] to ascend together [同得俱升].*\n\nThe orthodox method of ascension by household removal [拔宅正法] was revealed to the Five Emperors [告五帝]. *注：The Five Emperors [五帝] are the Five Great Celestial Lords of the directions [五方大帝君]. The Former Sage of the Upper Clarity [前圣上清] spoke of offering white jade talismans [素奏丹符], and the Later Sage Lord also revealed the true scriptures to the Five Emperors [真文中五帝亦是].*\n\nIf we follow the accounts given by the Former and Later Sage Lords [前后圣人所说], as well as the Celestial Venerable One’s teachings in the scriptures [天尊说经中言五帝], the Five Emperors are the five supreme Celestial Lords [一等五大帝], with no other ranks of Five Emperors [别无五帝位].\n\nSince possessing true names and lineages [有真名姓], in the true scriptures [真文] and the Venerable Lord’s secret talismans [老君秘符], it is said:\n\n*\"You wish to ascend your entire household [全家拔宅] and become a Celestial Immortal [上升天仙], attaining the rank of one of the Five Emperors of the directions [为五方帝之位者]. First, you must transform the Five Stars [变五星], manifest the Five Phases [出五行], erect the Five Viscera [竖五藏], transcend the Five Spirits [超五灵], and then you can harness the Five Essences [力摄五精] and command the ten thousand soldiers [驱役万兵]. Your wives and children will become immortals [妻子俱仙], and your servants and livestock will dwell in palaces and courtyards [奴婢宫阙居舍]. Ascending by household removal [拔宅上升] to the Celestial Courts [天庭], you will be titled as one of the Five Emperors of the directions [位号一方之帝], and lead all spirits under the sun, moon, and stars [统领群灵日月星].*\n*注：The sun rises and illuminates all directions and the central realm [日出皆照四方中央]. The Five Emperors’ domains [五帝之界] each have their own sun, moon, and stars [皆有日月星], with the three luminaries [三光] shining upon them. All are under the Five Emperors’ directional governance [俱照，皆是五帝随方统领者], and also belong to the Five Emperors by direction [亦随方属於五帝].*\n\n*The Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water [天地水三官], possess both soul and form [有魂魄，有形],*\n*注：Those with soul and form [有魂魄，有形] are called *jing* [精].*\n\n*and those with *qi* and without *qi*, with sound and without sound [有炁无炁，有声无声], all belong to the Five Emperors’ domain [皆属五帝之功], manifesting the Dao of nurturing and containing [生成含育之道].*\n*This is the method you must practice [是卿所行]—the commandment [行令].\"*\n\nThe **Dharma Key** [法诀]. The **Laozi** [老君] bestowed this key upon the Five Emperors [五帝], as well as the Three Sovereigns [三皇] and ten thousand **Daoist Immortals** [万仙人],*\n*注：The **Laozi** was born before Heaven and Earth [老君先天地生], initially manifesting as the **Dao Master** [始生为道主], and through successive generations, the teachings were transmitted without interruption [代代传教不绝]. The number of those who passed on the teachings before and after him totals ten thousand **Daoist Immortals** [万仙人] and more [已上]. For brevity, we will refer to them collectively as ten thousand.*\n\n—on the method of **ascending the body and extracting the dwelling** [举身拔宅之法], cultivating the **Way of soaring through the heavens** [修行飞蹑].*\n*注：The **Way of soaring through the heavens** [飞天纲] and the **Way of treading upon the earth** [蹑地纪].*\n\nIn fourteen years, when the **virtue/power** [功] is complete [欲功满], one should begin on the **Spring Day of the Heavenly Stem-Earthly Branch (甲子)** [取春甲子日起], invoking the **Six Ten Kings** [甲子王文卿等六十人], the **Decan Commanders** [旬将], along with the **Twelve Divine Generals** [神将一十二人], the **Sixty Jade Maidens of the Six Heavenly Stems** [六甲玉女六十人], the **Sixty Jade Maidens of the Six Earthly Branches** [六丁玉女六十人], and the **Nine Hundred and More Attendant Officials** [从官九百余人],*\n*注：The *Six Heavenly Stems Record* [《六甲录》] lists the exact number of Attendant Officials [从官直符正数], but these three texts differ, so the precise count is omitted here.*\n\n—along with **a million soldiers of the Dao** [兵士一百万人], keeping the invocation both before and behind the body [存呼在身后身在前].\n\nCommence from the **West-North (乾)** [西北乾] above the dwelling, facing **South** [面向南], proceeding with the **Yú Step** [步，作禹步行], circling the dwelling three times [绕宅三匝].*\n*注：The three encirclements [三匝] are to be performed during the stillness of night, when no one can see [夜静无人知见].*\n\nThen, **one attains it** [即　得], **but it must not be spoken of** [亦不得言之].\n\n「Furthermore, invoke the **Eight Generals of the Three Primordial Elements and Five Celestial Virtues** [三元五德将军八人], each commanding their troops—*\n*注：The **Three Primordial Generals** [三将军] are those of the Mid-Autumn (中元) recorded in the *Tang Ge Zhou’s Three Generals* [唐葛周三将军] text, with each commanding **thirty million soldiers** [兵士各三千万人]. The **Five Celestial Virtues** [五德] refer to the **Generals of the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Tortoise, and Yellow Court** [青龙、白虎、朱雀、玄武、黄庭大将军等五人], invoked as though holding the *Grand Design* [含弘图].*\n\n**Align the troops of the Three Primordial Elements with their respective generals** [三元随配兵士], as noted previously [具前注]. **Drive them in the four directions.***\n*注：The **Five Celestial Virtues Generals** [五德将军] are as follows: the **Azure Dragon General** [青龙将军] of the East, commanding **eighty-one hundred thousand soldiers** [兵士八十一万人]; the **White Tiger General** [白虎将军] of the West, commanding **thirty-six hundred thousand soldiers** [兵士三十六万人]; the **Vermilion Bird General** [朱雀将军] of the South, commanding **sixty-four hundred thousand soldiers** [兵士六十四万人]; the **Dark Tortoise General** [玄武将军] of the North, commanding **twenty-five hundred thousand soldiers** [兵士二十五万人]; and the **Yellow Court General** [黄庭将军] of the Center, commanding **twelve hundred thousand soldiers** [兵士一十二万人]. Each follows their native domain [各随本属], with their officials leading the soldiers [官领兵士] and arriving accordingly.*\n\n**Additionally, summon the Six Generals of the *Golden Lockets and Flowing Pearls*** [《金锁流珠》中六纪将军六人] from the text, each commanding **twelve hundred thousand soldiers** [兵士各一十二万人], and the **Pillar-Heaven Generals** [柱天将军] numbering **one thousand two hundred** [一千二百人]—*\n*注：The **Pillar-Heaven Generals** [柱天将军] correspond to the **one thousand two hundred days** [一千二百日] of a sovereign’s reign, directly aligning with the celestial pillar [直柱天上也]. Each general leads **twelve hundred thousand soldiers** [人各兵士一十二万人].*\n\n**Each holds a *Golden Lockets and Flowing Pearls*** [各金锁流珠], their radiance sharp and brilliant, with **three hundred sixty thousand soldiers and steeds** [兵马众三十六万人等], responding to the will and command of the invoker [随心应口]. Thus, they form a **mysterious bond** [玄结] with this humble servant, sealing this dwelling’s boundary—**\n**circular and rectangular, measuring [方圆若干亩], ten zhang thick** [厚十丈], and **one hundred chi in height** [百尺], harmonizing with the house and land alike, all rising together [与地俱升].*\n\n**Swiftly, swiftly, as the *Liturgical Commandments* decree** [急急如律令].\n**Immediately, recite the *Flick of the Heavenly and Earthly Deities’ Talismans*** [即捻天神地神诀].\n\n**Annotations:**\nThe *Heavenly Deity Talisman* is located at the third joint of the left hand’s third finger [左手第三指第三节], always bound with five-colored threads. Moreover, on each day of the moon’s waxing phase, it must be anointed with vermilion and ink before twisting.\n\nThe *Earthly Deity Talisman* lies beneath both feet. **Note:** Near the heart of the left foot is a mark resembling a fish—this is the *Earthly Deity Talisman*. Always, when approaching the *Step-Binding Rite* [步纲日], three days prior, anoint it with vermilion and ink before performing the rite.\n\nAdditionally, one must twist the *Dwelling Deity Talisman* and the *Water Deity-Kua Deity Talisman*, located at the second joint of the left hand’s fourth finger—this governs the entire dwelling. The *Superintendent of the Twelve Monthly Deities* must also be invoked through the *Supreme Deity’s Eye* and the *Descending Palace Talisman*, etc.\n\nUpon completion, command the deities thus:\n\n*\"To the five celestial generals of the East—*Jia, Yi, Ying, Mao, Chen*—governed by the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches, leading eight hundred and ten thousand officers and soldiers, to forbid trespass and uproot this dwelling! The East marks the *Mysterious Dwelling’s* outer boundary, penetrating ten zhang into the earth, blending with the soil to uproot. May the decree ascend—along with the household’s living and dead, male and female, fowl and canine—all ascending to the Celestial Court. Swiftly, swiftly, as the *Liturgical Commandments* decree.\"*\n\n*\"To the five celestial generals of the South—*Bing, Ding, Ji, Wu, Wei*—governed by the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches, leading six hundred and forty thousand officers and soldiers, to forbid trespass and uproot this dwelling! The South marks the *Mysterious Dwelling’s* outer boundary, penetrating ten zhang into the earth, blending with the soil to uproot. May the decree ascend—along with the household’s great and small, male and female, slaves and maidservants, fowl and canine—all ascending to the Celestial Court. Swiftly, swiftly, as the *Liturgical Commandments* decree.\"*\n\n*\"To the five celestial generals of the West—*Geng, Xin, Shen, You, Xu*—governed by the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches, leading three hundred and sixty thousand officers and soldiers, to forbid trespass and uproot this dwelling! The West marks the *Mysterious Dwelling’s* outer boundary, penetrating ten zhang into the earth, blending with the soil to uproot. May the decree ascend—along with the household’s great and small, slaves and maidservants, fowl and canine—*\n**Note:** *The ancient texts omit the term \"slaves,\" but in *The Inner Transmission of the Later Sage-King*, it explicitly states that during dwelling-uprooting, disciples (male and female) and slaves and maidservants are included. Moreover, it is often recorded that disciples, male and female slaves, fowl, canines, oxen, and horses ascend together in great numbers. This is the work of the winds, hence the earlier omission in the Eastern invocation.*\"\n\nAnd from the South, beginning and concluding with the Four Directions, Four Cardinal Points, and Four Fixations—this is transmitted only to those who uphold the Dao/Way, not to the common folk. Together, ascend to the Celestial Court. **Swiftly, as the decree commands.**\n\nAgain, the Northern Five Deities of *Geng-Xin-Shen-You-Xu* and *Ren-Gui-Hai-Zi-Chou* branches, commanding twenty-five ten-thousand officers and soldiers, to forbid trespass and uproot this dwelling. The North marks the *Mysterious Dwelling’s* outer boundary, penetrating ten *zhang* into the earth, blending with the soil to uproot. May the decree ascend—along with the household’s great and small, wives and concubines, male and female alike.\n**Note:** The ancient texts also omit the terms \"wives and concubines, male and female,\" but in *The Later Sage-King’s Transmission to the Heavenly Master on Dwelling-Uprooting*, the decree to officers and soldiers explicitly includes \"wives and concubines\" and \"male and female.\" Within the Northern invocation, it specifies three wives, four concubines, and one child. All are detailed in the Northern Dwelling-Uprooting Decree. This is transmitted to those who uphold the Dao/Way, for they know that through great merit in cultivation, wives and concubines may ascend together to the Celestial Palaces of the Immortals. Slaves, maidservants, fowl, and canines ascend to the Celestial Court. **Swiftly, as the decree commands.**\n\nAgain, the Four Directions—\n**Note:** *Yin, Shen, Wei, Hai* are the Four Directional Deities.\nAlso called the Four Seasonal Deities.\nAnd the Four Cardinal Points—\n**Note:** *Zi, Wu, Mao, You* are the names of the Four Cardinal Points.\nAnd the Four Fixations—\n**Note:** *Chen, Xiu, Chou, Wei* are the Four Fixations.\nAlso, it is said: The Four Seasons are the earthly names for the Four Fixations, aligned with the master’s intent. The first Fixation is Southeast, the second Northwest, the third Northeast, the fourth Southwest—hence the name Four Fixations. The scripture states: Where the Fixation is set, great calamity shall arise. Aligned with the earthly branch, thus where Saturn’s influence lingers, great calamity shall befall. The Later Sage-King knew this, so he established the Dwelling-Uprooting Divine Method, naming it the Four Fixations, to repel misfortune and avert disaster. No calamity dares to encroach. The great Dao’s divine power, the rectified Fixation’s force, uproots the dwelling. The combined power of the twelve gods of the third and fourth ranks lifts the dwelling to ascend to the clouds, to the Seven-Treasured Mysterious Platform of the Golden Gate, the Jade Capital’s Upper Palace within the Luohean Great City, upon the vacant sacred land within ten *mu*, where the dwelling may reside. As a minister aiding the Later Sage-King’s Palace, one attains the rank of lesser official, eternal life and longevity, and may serve the Later Sage-King as desired. The decree commands the uprooting of this dwelling—**swiftly, as the decree commands.**\n\nAgain, the six *Wu-Ji* Generals and six *Liu-Ji* Generals, each commanding twelve ten-thousand soldiers, with the *Xuanbu* officers forbidding trespass, uprooting the dwelling to ascend. The Heavenly Immortals unite in heart and strength, alongside the twelve gods of the Four Directions, their beasts, soldiers, horses, and all—together forming the dwelling’s boundary, ascending to the Celestial Court within the Golden Gate and Jade Capital. **Swiftly, as the decree commands.** Recite and chant.\n\n---\n\n**Annotation:** *Note: When reading, one must roll the scroll; otherwise, it is not as effective as reciting. The Great Sage-Laozi says: If one wishes to uproot the dwelling and ascend to the Celestial Court—*\n\n**Annotation:** *The Celestial Court refers to the Palace of the Jade Emperor, the Most High, and is thus called the Celestial Court.*\n\n—*first invoke the deities of the human gate,*\n\n**Annotation:** *The human gate (人门) refers to the gate of the mortal realm.*\n\n—*from the southwest to the northwest of the dwelling, invoking the upper deities: the Monkey-headed, human-bodied one, clad in white robes, left hand grasping an arrow, right hand holding a crossbow, named **Jianbing** (监兵), who guards the southwest quadrant of Heaven and commands a hundred thousand soldiers. The Rooster-headed, human-bodied one, clad in white robes, left hand grasping an arrow, right hand holding a crossbow, named **Zi’en** (子恩), guards the due west of Heaven and commands a hundred thousand soldiers. The Dog-headed, human-bodied one, clad in white robes, left hand grasping an arrow, right hand holding a crossbow, named **Gonglong** (弓隆), guards the northwest quadrant of Heaven and commands a hundred thousand soldiers.*\n\n—*from the northwest to the northeast of the dwelling, invoking the upper deities: the Boar-headed, human-bodied one, clad in black robes, left hand wielding a hooked spear, named **Bùlín** (不临), who guards the northwest quadrant of Heaven and commands a hundred thousand soldiers. The Rat-headed, human-bodied one, clad in black robes, left hand wielding a hooked spear, named **Zhímíng** (执明), guards the due north of Heaven and commands a hundred thousand soldiers. The Ox-headed, human-bodied one, clad in black robes, left hand wielding a hooked spear, named **Ājūn** (阿君), guards the northeast quadrant of Heaven and commands a hundred thousand soldiers.*\n\n—*from the northeast to the southeast of the dwelling, invoking the upper deities: the Tiger-headed, human-bodied one, clad in green robes, left hand holding a spear, named **Mèngzhāng** (孟章), who guards the northeast quadrant of Heaven and commands a hundred thousand soldiers. The Hare-headed, human-bodied one, clad in green robes, left hand holding a spear, named **Ménzhī** (门之), guards the due east of Heaven and commands a hundred thousand soldiers. The Dragon-headed, human-bodied one, clad in green robes, left hand holding a spear, named **Tiānjīn** (天禽), guards the southeast quadrant of Heaven and commands a hundred thousand soldiers.*\n\n—*from the southeast to the southwest of the dwelling, invoking the upper deities: the Serpent-headed, human-bodied one, clad in red robes, left hand holding a pike, named **Yìfáng** (寄房), who guards the southeast quadrant of Heaven and commands a hundred thousand soldiers. The Horse-headed, human-bodied one, clad in red robes, left hand holding a pike, named **Língguāng** (陵光), guards the due south of Heaven and commands a hundred thousand soldiers. The Sheep-headed, human-bodied one, clad in red robes, left hand holding a pike, named **Chújūn** (除君), guards the southwest quadrant of Heaven and commands a hundred thousand soldiers.*\n\n*The Left General emerges from the Southern Gate of the Big Dipper and flies to the left. The Central General emerges from the Southern Gate of the Big Dipper and flies ahead.*\n\nThe Right General emerges from the Southern Gate of the Big Dipper and flies to the right.\n\nSummon the three generals by name in a low voice. When finished,\n**Annotation:** Left General: surname Tang, given name Hong. Right General: surname Ge, given name Yong. Central General: surname Zhou, given name Wu.\nThe three generals’ names are recorded in their talismans (*fù*). When invoking, write only their names and append their talisman characters.\n\nWhenever encountering multiple talismans without the three generals’ names, do not annotate them.\n\nNext, invoke:\nLeft—**Qīnglóng** (青龙),\nRight—**Báihǔ** (白虎),\nFront—**Zhūquè** (朱雀),\nRear—**Xuānwǔ** (玄武),\nGate—**Shīzǐ** (师子),\nCentral courtyard—**Báiè** (白鹤),\nand the **Zǐyún Gài** (紫云盖) over the dwelling.\n\nThen enter through the **Earthly Gate**,\n**Annotation:** The Earthly Gate is the southeast door.\nWithin the courtyard, tread the **Earthly Compass** (*Dìjì*) three times, then the **Celestial Ropes** (*Tiāngāng*) three times.\n\nWhen finished, disperse into the **Great Yú’s Steps** (*Dàyǔ bù*) fifteen strides.\n\nWhen finished, **align the robes** with seven *dǒu* of grain.\n**Annotation:** In previous methods, alignment required one or two *dǒu* of grain. This **Dwelling-Extraction Method** demands seven *dǒu* for completion.\n\nThis is from *The Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl* (《金锁流珠》), Volume Two, Upper Section—concerning the **Earthly Compass**—where the **qi of the Seven Mansions** first becomes sufficient, summoning ten thousand spirits and myriad sacred beings to guard and assist the body.\n\nThen turn the **Celestial Ropes**, pointing to the four directions and the Central Palace, the four cardinals and four intercardinals—each as prescribed.\n\nWithin no more than three years, the dwelling, along with the practitioner’s family—men, women, and all household creatures—shall ascend as Heavenly Immortals.\n\n**Facing east**, turn the **Celestial Ropes** and point to the **East Boundary** of the **Jia-Yǐ** region (Wood, the **Yin-Yǎo-Chén** three generals). Each commands a hundred thousand soldiers. Erect this dwelling’s eastern side with sturdy earth and wood above, and an iron-encircled steel foundation below. If the eastern side is properly aligned, the practitioner and household—noble or lowly, even chickens and dogs—shall all ascend as Heavenly Immortals in the Celestial Court.\n*As the command is given, so it shall be done.*\n\n**Facing south**, turn the **Celestial Ropes** and point to the **South Boundary** of the **Bǐng-Dīng** region (Fire, the **Wǔ-Wǔ-Wèi** three generals). Each commands a hundred thousand soldiers. Erect this dwelling’s southern side with sturdy earth and wood above, and an iron-encircled steel foundation below. If the southern side is properly aligned, the practitioner and household—noble or lowly, even chickens and dogs—shall all ascend as Heavenly Immortals in the Celestial Court.\n*As the command is given, so it shall be done.*\n\n**Facing west**, turn the **Celestial Ropes** and point to the **West Boundary** of the **Gēng-Xīn** region (Metal, the **Shēn-Yǒu-Xū** three generals). Each commands a hundred thousand soldiers. Erect this dwelling’s western side with sturdy earth and wood above, and an iron-encircled steel foundation below. If the western side is properly aligned, the practitioner and household—noble or lowly, even chickens and dogs—shall all ascend as Heavenly Immortals in the Celestial Court.\n*As the command is given, so it shall be done.*\n\n**Facing north**, turn the **Celestial Ropes** and point to the **North Boundary** of the **Rén-Gǔi** region (Water, the **Hài-Zǐ-Chǒu** three generals). Each commands a hundred thousand soldiers. Erect this dwelling’s northern side with sturdy earth and wood above, and an iron-encircled steel foundation below. If the northern side is properly aligned, the practitioner and household—noble or lowly, even chickens and dogs—shall all ascend as Heavenly Immortals in the Celestial Court.\n*As the command is given, so it shall be done.*\n\n**Standing before the Heavenly Gate**, face upward, surveying the Central Palace and its upper and lower realms. Turn the **Celestial Ropes** and point to the Central Palace and the four seasonal regions (Earth, the **Wù-Wèi-Chén-Xū-Zǐ-Wèi** six generals).\n**Annotation:** The scripture speaks of the **Six Compass Generals**.\nEach leads a hundred thousand soldiers, totaling six hundred thousand troops—all under the **Nine Earth Gods’** divine command, capable of moving mountains and damming seas, their dwelling-extraction power immense.\n\nTogether with the four cardinal and intercardinal officers and the **Great Generals of the Stellar Officials**, with united hearts and strength, they shall extract the dwelling and make it float in the sky—no greater difficulty than commonplace matters.\n\nEach commands a hundred thousand soldiers. Erect this dwelling’s central palace with three inner chambers, east and west corridors, a hall, gate, and storehouse, four surrounding courtyards (east, west, south, north), a quiet chamber, granary, high-legged stove, central courtyard study, and slave quarters as needed.\n**Annotation:** The Heavenly Master’s dwelling has one hundred twenty rooms. The Shu Zhang Heavenly Master’s dwelling, with one hundred twenty rooms, was also extracted and ascended to the **Golden Gate’s Inner City** in the **Yùjīng’s** southeast void, occupying sixty-four *mǔ* of land as his residence. There, he served as the **Left Celestial Prime Minister** under the **Posterior Sage of the Jade Capital**, his halls and structures fortified with iron foundations in the central palace.\n\nThe dwelling’s size—great or small—must have sturdy tiles and wood. Within: three inner chambers, east and west corridors, hall, gate, storehouse, four surrounding courtyards, quiet chamber, granary, high-legged stove, and all necessary slave quarters. The practitioner and household—noble or lowly, including residences, chicken coops, and horse stables—must all ascend together to the Celestial Court.\n*As the command is given, so it shall be done.*\n\nNext, command the **Four Cardinals**,\n\nThe **Four Cardinals**—Mao, You, Zi, Wu—are fixed.\nThe **Four Defined**—Chen, Xū, Chǒu, Wèi—are established.\nThe **Eight Trigrams**: Qián, Kàn, Gèn, Zhèn, Xùn, Lí, Kūn, Duì.\n\nThe **Three Generals of the Residence**, the **Five Phases of Well and Hearth**, the **Six Jia and Six Ding**, and all divine soldiers—when summoned by the **Mystic Command**, they shall act as commanded. Lift the residence and its structures, fly alongside the body, and ascend to dwell above.\n\n*As the command is given, so it shall be done.*\n\nThen cease, and recite the **Grand Overseer’s Secret**, along with the **Heavenly Principles and Earthly Principles Secrets**, either inscribed in red or black ink. When finished, the task is complete.\n\nOften thus, practiced for three years, the spirits will ever guard the residence and body, enabling the ascent of the dwelling together.\n\nThis method is most wondrous—do not recklessly transmit it to the unworthy.\n\nThe **Posterior Sage of the Jade Capital** instructed the **Twenty-Nine True Ones of the Mystic Realm** and **Master Zhang of Heaven** thus:\n\n*\"From this day forward, teach those with sincere Daoist intent and good will to first cultivate **yin virtue** in all things.\n**Note:** *Yin virtue* is detailed in the preceding annotations.\n\nDo not nurture malevolent creatures; instead, accumulate deeds of **yin virtue**.\n**Note:** When *yin virtue* is complete, Daoist merit is established, and descendants flourish while the residence ascends with the body.\n\nAvoid **yin schemes and envy**; always practice **yin benevolence and strength**.\n**Note:** When virtue extends to all beings, such a path will naturally attract the worthy—it is not the worthy who seek the path.\n\nIn ancient times, the **Ascetic of Bitter Practice** relentlessly sought wealth to bestow upon others, amassing merit ten thousandfold. By day, a spirit descended, and together they ascended to the celestial realm.\n\nNow, the **Mystic Command** of this method, infused with virtue, inspires you. Further refine this **central incantation**, summoning all great divine spirits to aid in lifting the residence and ascending to the heavens.\n\nFor mortals, use the **step-incantation** to invoke the great gods of Heaven and Earth, assisting you in lifting the residence and ascending to the Celestial Court.*\n\nAgain, the Sage instructed Master Zhang:\n\n*\"If you desire a residence, livestock, and all that ascends with you upon the Daoist chariot to the Heavenly Dao—when a new dwelling is fully constructed, its four gates sealed as in a prefectural or county home,\n**Note:** The residence should resemble a temple, newly built with sturdy foundations. For newly constructed dwellings of solidity—\n\nFollow the **step-treading central incantation** as before. When the merit reaches one thousand days, you shall naturally ascend with me.\n\nThe Heavenly Emperor selects auspicious land, erects the foundation, and plants the structure within the Jade Capital, ever commanding celestial spirits to guard this residence without ceasing.*\n\nAgain, the Sage instructed Master Zhang:\n\n*\"If a mortal’s residence is unstable, with loss of life or property, on the **Four Beginning Days**, inscribe on stones of five colors the characters **‘Dissipate Calamities and Repel Harm’**, each governing a cardinal direction.\n**Note:** East—blue stone, South—red stone, West—white stone, North—black stone, Central Palace—yellow stone. For the Son of Heaven, one thousand *jin*; for nobles, six hundred *jin*; each weighing one hundred twenty *jin*.\nAccording to the *Ritual for Pacifying the Residence*, for the fifth rank and below, one hundred twenty *jin*. Each stone bears four characters, buried one *chi* deep—this is the standard for lesser nobles. For commoners, one *chi*; for Daoists, three *chi*—these are the original measurements.\n\nLater, if you wish to lift the residence and ascend, these stones need not be moved. This is the **Supreme Realm’s method for pacifying the residence**—keep it secret, and do not transmit it recklessly to the unworthy.*\n\n**Laozi said:** *\"When preparing to lift the residence and ascend through practice—\n**Note:** This refers to those who practice the method of lifting the residence, reciting the step-incantation both day and night.\n\nBefore beginning, place the **Original Master** at the forefront, followed by the **Jade Boys and Jade Girls**, the **Three Sovereigns and Five Virtues**, the **Six Jia and Eight Trigrams**,\n**Note:** The Eight Trigrams: Jia, Yi, Bing, Ding, Geng, Xin, Ren, Gui—these are the divine spirits of the trigrams.\n\nthe **Twelve Branches**, and the **Twenty-Four Qi Spirits**, riding the **Chariot of the Exalted**, driving the **Dragon Chariot**, arriving before you. The Original Master follows behind, and you stand as in the *Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl* diagram.\n\nThus, for three years, the Master summons the Earth Spirits, ordering the **Earth Axis** to perpetually encircle the residence on either side, dispelling all malevolent and harmful *qi*, ensuring perpetual tranquility and security. The spirits are arrayed in ranks, awaiting the day the residence’s master ascends, following the Original Master’s commands.\n**Note:** According to the *Canon of the Orthodox Dao*, when one attains the Dao, it is because the Original Master’s disciple naturally reveres the teacher. The Master, in the void, knows the disciple’s filial heart. On the day of attainment, the **Most High** dispatches an envoy to welcome them, leading them to pay respects to the officials, observing proper greetings and bows before announcing their ascent to a celestial abode.\n\nThe generals float above the residence, entering the **Five Clouds**, the Earth Axis and Earth Locks rolling with the land, ascending with the master without difficulty. In an instant, the **Dragon, Tiger, Phoenix, Warrior, Lion, and Crane** stand ready to lift them lightly into the air.\n\n**Laozi’s Transmission of the Inner Central Incantation Diagram for Lifting the Residence**\nThis residence extends **560 paces** from west to east, north to south.\nThis residence extends **560 paces** from east to west, north to south.\nIf not adhering to this, it is the **Heavenly Master’s residential measurement**, as depicted in the diagram.\nNow, mortals may adjust the length and breadth as needed.*\n\n**Laozi said:** *\"When the step-incantation is complete, invoke the **Central Marshal Spirit** from the earth—one thousand two hundred in number, each wielding a sword, six *zhang* five *chi* tall, with a single stride covering sixty *zhang*, possessing immense strength to aid in lifting the residence. When the incantation is recited and the secret is invoked, the spirit arrives to assist in lifting the residence—this is most efficacious, swift as the wind. The diagram is found in the *Canon of the Flowing Pearl*.\n**Note:** Within the *Flowing Pearl*, in the **Central Element’s Three Generals** section.\n\n*End of Volume Eleven of the Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl.*\n*End of Volume Twelve of the Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl.\"*\n\nNow, the **Zhenren** of the Central Kingdom, the Great Immortal Master, **Zaiwang Fangping**, **Zhang Daoling**, **Zhao Sheng**, **Wang Chang**, **Li Zhongfu**, **Mao Ying**, **Xu Yufu**, and others, are those who composed this in succession. The **Immortal Master Li Chunfeng** annotated it.\n\nThe **Five Phases** and **Six Seasons** give rise to the following:\n\nThe **Taishang Lao君 (Laozi)** said to the **Taiji Zhenren** (True Person of the Supreme Ultimate):\n\n*\"The Dao generates **One**,\n**Note:** **One** refers to Heaven.\nThe **Taiyi** (Great Unity) Spirit, named the **Qi** of the **Taiyang** (Great Sun), emits the **Taiyang**’s radiant essence, condensing into the Sun.\nThe **Qi** of the Sun descends and unites with **Yin** below.\n**One** generates **Two**,\n**Note:** **Two** refers to Earth.\nThe **Qi** of **Yin**, ascending, forms the Moon. The **Qi** of the Moon merges below with **Yang**, thus the **Yin** and **Yang** **Qi** intermingle, condensing into sentient beings who dwell between Heaven and Earth—known as the **Three Talents** (San Cai).\n**Two** generates **Three**,\n**Note:** **Three** refers to Humanity.\nOnce there is Humanity, there arise the four seasons—**Cold, Heat, Spring, Autumn**—in cyclical rotation, endlessly recurring, giving birth to the **Four Heavenly Kings** (Sijian Sishen, Sifu).\nThis doctrine comes from the *Thunder King’s Rituals* (Leigong Shì), a record by the **Yellow Emperor** (Huangdi), applied to the four seasons, producing the **Four Pillars** (Sifu).\nEach **Pillar** governs a direction, issuing commands—these are **Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter**.\nCalled the **Four Heavenly Kings**, they harmonize with the **Four Rituals** (Sishi), overseeing the **Four Pillars** (Sifu).\n\n**Three** generates the **Four Seasons**, as previously annotated.\nThe **Four Seasons** generate the **Five Phases**,\n**Note:** The **Five Phases** are what follows.\nThe **Five Phases** generate the **Six Jia** (Lujia), the **Six Jia** generate the **Seven Stars** (Qixing), the **Seven Stars** generate the **Eight Trigrams** (Bagua), the **Eight Trigrams** generate the **Nine Essences** (Jiujing), the **Nine Essences** generate the **Ten Celestial Stems** (Shiganzhen), the **Ten Celestial Stems** generate the **Twelve Earthly Branches** (Shierzhixiang), the **Twelve Earthly Branches** generate the **Twenty-Eight Constellations** (Ershibaxiu), and the **Twenty-Eight Constellations** generate the **Five Luminaries and Thirty-Six Official Stars** (Wudou Sanshi Liu Guanxing). The **Five Luminaries** and **Thirty-Six Official Stars** generate the **Three Filths and Five Official Stars** (Sanwu Wuguanxing), which in turn produce the **Circulating Heavens of Ten Thousand Phenomena** (Zhoutian Wanshang), and the **Circulating Heavens** generate the **Boundless** (Wuqiong).\n\nThe **Five Phases** are thus generated. Named **Metal, Water, Wood, Fire, Earth**, they are the **Five Stars** (Wuxing).\nWhen a mortal’s life begins, they are assigned the **Five Phases**, thus receiving their fate.\nThey also follow the **Five Phases**, determining their rise and decline.\n**Note:** *For those who study the Dao, always observe that Metal and Wood oppose each other—I do not endure opposition. Metal generates Water—I follow accordingly. Water extinguishes Fire—I do not endure extinction. Fire generates Wood—I flourish and thrive. If the Five Phases do not harm me, I seek eternal life.*\n\nThe **Five** (Wu) are manifest in Heaven’s **Five Stars**, humanity’s **Five Viscera** (Wuzang), and Earth’s **Five Mountains** (Wuyue)—the **Three Fives** (Sanwu).\n\n**One** is the sovereign of all **Dao**, the origin of all Spirits, encompassing the vast without exclusion, containing the minute without omission.\n**Note:** **One** is said to permeate even the finest details, encompassing the greatest breadth—thus it is.\n\nHence, it can both generate and extinguish mortals.\n**Note:** *When the Five Phases support each other, they generate. When they oppose each other, they extinguish.*\nAll that mortals generate are governed by the **Five Phases**.\n\nFor instance, a person born under the **Eastern Wood Phase** (Mingming) with **Hai** (亥) as their **Pillar** (Fufu), generates **Water**,\n**Note:** *Water can float Wood, and Earth can nourish Wood. A Wood Phase fate receiving the Qi of these two stars is auspicious.*\nand **Fire** can burn Wood, making them a **Great King** (Dawang).\n**Metal** opposes Wood—Wood fears **Metal**.\nThey generate **Earth**,\n**Note:** *Though Wood opposes Earth, Earth can also sustain Wood. Wood remains unharmed while generating the auspicious symbol of a king—thus, wearing an Earth Phase talisman is fortunate.*\nand they generate **Fire**.\n**Note:** *Fire and Wood unite—though Wood is consumed by Fire, its Qi of transformation and assimilation remains unharmed, and it attains greatness as a king. It is fitting to wear a Fire Phase talisman to seek wealth.*\nYet they fear **Metal**.\n**Note:** *Metal opposes Wood.*\n\nIn the **Jiazi** (甲子) cycle, there are sixty days when **Metal** opposes **Wood**—these are:\n**Jiazi** (甲子), **Jiawu** (甲午), **Renyin** (壬寅), **Xinhao** (辛亥), **Renshen** (壬申), **Guiyou** (癸酉).\nThese six days are the ones in question.\nIf one practices as usual, on **Dingmao** (丁卯) Fire Days, inscribe the talisman of the **Yinghuo Star King** (Yinghuo Xingjun) and wear it. Replace the talisman every sixty days.\n\nFor those born under the **Fire Phase** (Mingming), using **Yin** (寅) as their **Pillar**, they generate **Wood**,\n**Note:** *Wood nourishes Fire, and Earth sustains Fire. One might also say Water can extinguish Fire—Fire thus fears Water.*\nand wear **Earth** talismans on long straps to subdue it, achieving longevity.\nThey generate **Metal**,\n**Note:** *Though Fire melts Metal, it also refines and transmutes it into vessels—thus the way of mutual transformation.*\nand their kingship lies in **Wood** and **Earth**.\n**Note:** *Fire attains kingship through Wood and finds stability through Earth. Thus, wear Wood talismans for kingship and Earth talismans to stabilize the spirit.*\n\nYet they fear **Water**.\n**Note:** *Water extinguishes Fire.*\n\nThus, those born under the **Fire Phase** are few, and their **Pillars** are often weak, with many afflictions, calamities, and encounters with ghosts and demons—this is because **Water** can extinguish **Fire**. Among the **Four Pillars**, only **Water** and **Fire** are said to mutually extinguish. One must invest in the Dao early in life.\nWear talismans of **Earth** and **Wood** to subdue the **Fire** within, thus attaining bodily peace and spiritual protection.\nAdditionally, chant the names of the **Earth** and **Wood** stars’ essences aloud—guard the body of this humble servant, repelling the calamitous **Water** star’s long essence. Command it to depart from this humble servant’s spirit and body, from the **Three Souls** (Sanhun) and **Seven Spirits** (Qipo), and remain two thousand *li* away, never to interfere again.\n\nInscribe **Wood** talismans on Fire Days and **Earth** talismans on Metal Days, and wear them perpetually—auspicious.\n\nFor those born under the **Metal Phase** (Mingming), using **Yi** (巳) as their **Pillar**, they generate **Earth**,\n**Note:** *This is not the true Earth Phase; Yi borrows the position of Chen (辰), Chen being the true Earth.*\nand **Yi** is the true Fire Phase.\nFire opposes Metal, which is not the Metal’s true origin.\nIn ancient times, the great immortals thus shifted their palaces to borrow positions, taking Chen twice—this is because the seasonal spirits do not properly receive their generated phases, and one must again push the true position to Yi.\nYi belongs to Fire, hence it is taken as the generated phase.\nYet always contemplate the **Earth** star—wear talismans of **Earth** and **Fire** together, never letting them oppose each other, but instead generating and transforming each other—thus achieving kingship.\nThey transform through **Wood** and **Fire**,\n**Note:** *Though Fire opposes Metal, it also refines and transmutes it into vessels.*\n\nThe **Sage’s correct intent** states: *\"A slight initial misfortune will be followed by lasting good fortune.\"*\n\nAgain, Metal can subdue Wood, and Wood can generate Fire. Fire cannot arise without Wood, so it is said that **Wood and Fire** generate each other and can thus subdue Metal.\n\n**Metal-born individuals** must employ **Water and Earth** stars and planets, shifting and turning to subdue and harmonize. Therefore, each night when one sleeps, they should always preserve the **Earth star** and **Water spirit** to protect their body, with the **Wood spirit** before them and the **Fire spirit** behind them, constantly guarding them. They should also wear talismans of **Earth and Fire** upon themselves, so that they may always generate and transform each other, never opposing or harming one another.\n\nLater, the **Sage of the Later Age** instructed **Chisongzi** (赤松子): *\"You are a Metal-born individual. Your origin lies in **Yi** (已), which belongs to the Fire Phase, and within that Phase, you must always endure. This is because being of that Phase, it is naturally harmful to your body. You can take **Chen** (辰) as your borrowed palace, for the Earth Phase belongs to Metal, ensuring lasting good fortune. Also, wear talismans of **Wood and Water** to suppress any harmful **qi** (炁), for it will naturally dissipate and vanish. The **qi** that rules is **Water**,*\n**Note:** *Water can generate Metal, hence it is taken as the ruling **qi**.*\n\n*always wear talismans of the **Water star**, placing them upon your head, for lasting good fortune. The **qi** you fear is **Fire**.*\n**Note:** *If Fire acts alone to subdue Metal, Metal will suffer harm. If Water comes before Fire, Fire cannot subdue Metal. Hence, for those seeking Metal’s salvation, Water is the answer.*\n\n**Metal-born individuals** should always, at night, contemplate the **Water spirit**, visualizing it upon their body, beside them, and within the tent around them, keeping it ever-present as though seen. The **Fire star** and **Chen** essence will not dare to approach, ensuring that one will never be harmed throughout their life. With practice, they will achieve their desired outcome, and when their merit is complete, they will ascend during daylight.\n\nLater, the **Sage of the Later Age** told the **Celestial Master** (天师): *\"It is not only that Metal-born individuals fear Fire; all five types of individuals have mutual subduing and annihilation. They all depend on this Metal-born calculation to find their generating **qi**, teaching future generations. Though Metal fears Fire, it is refined and cast into form through Fire’s tempering, and supported by Water, it naturally attains firmness and integrity—such as the use of blackened Metal as vessels. This is the Metal of the five colors.\"*\n**Note:** *Gold, silver, iron, copper, and tin are the five Metals.*\n\n*All must follow the great principles to attain their true forms. For **Water-born** and **Earth-born** individuals, their generating palace is **Shen** (申), and they generate Metal.*\n**Note:** *Metal, here, refers to the **Western Metal Phase** (西方金). The native Phase of Water and Earth.*\n\n*Though Water and Earth generate the five Metals, it is not the five Metals that generate from Water and Earth. What is meant by \"generating Metal\" is that the **Western Metal Phase** (庚辛之地) belongs to the Metal Phase, and thus the **Water and Earth stars**, being of the **Greater Yin** (太阴) **qi**, form into the shapes of Water and Earth—this is their native Phase belonging to Metal. The **qi** that transforms is **Wood**.*\n**Note:** *Though Wood floats upon Water, it can generate Water’s **virtue/power** (德).*\n\nAgain, it transforms into **Fire**.\n**Note:** Fire finds stability in Earth, and Earth, with Fire, becomes firm and unyielding—thus, it is said that they mutually perfect each other in forming vessels.\n\nIt generates **Metal**.\n**Note:** Metal is the child of Water; though unseen, it receives the **virtue/power** of the Sovereign, hence its alignment with the Sovereign’s symbols in the use of Water and Metal.\n\nThe methods of these two Phases are fundamentally the same as before.\n\nAgain, what they **Sovereign** is the same: Water **Sovereigns** over Metal, which is the **Sovereignty** of Earth.\n\nThe **qi** of the Five Phases each have what mutually perfects and what mutually restrains.\nThus, when a person receives mutual perfection, their lifespan is long; when they receive mutual restraint, their lifespan is short—this is not a matter of Heaven’s decree.\nIf one does not know this within oneself, they will inevitably meet death.\nIf one’s body and mind know this, their lifespan will be eternal without decay.\n**Note:** This is Laozi speaking to Yin Xi.\n\nThe Sage is no different from Heaven and Earth, yet even they have their ailments.\n**Note:** Their ailments are the winds and rains of sorrow—this is what is meant by \"disease.\"\nDisease is also the result of the **qi** of the Five Phases mutually restraining and defeating one another, hence it is called \"Heaven’s disease.\"\nI often ponder how to preserve firmness and unyieldingness in the body, thereby escaping disease.\nThe method to escape disease is rooted in the Five Phases.\n**Note:** The Five Phases: Metal, Water, Wood, Fire, and Earth.\n\nThe divine method of longevity was passed down by the ancient Sages and practiced by the Yellow Emperor.\n\nFor **Wood-born** individuals, select **Dinghai** (丁亥, Fire Day) or **Guihai** (癸亥, Water Day), recite the **Water Star** incantation, and walk the Five Stars five times to receive the longevity incantation.\nOften on **Yimao** (乙卯, Wood Day) or **Dingmao** (丁卯, Fire Day), establish **Mao** and walk the Five Stars to dispel calamities and diseases, ascending to the Palace of Life, Honor, and Sovereignty.\nRecite the incantation to dispel calamities, walk the Five Stars nine times, and chant the Five Phase spells, eighteen verses each.\n**Note:** The eighteen spells are found in *Liuzhu* (流珠), the second step of the fast section.\nRecite the **Water-Earth** incantation, and **virtue/power** and blessings will assist—thus, the **Wood-born** body attains longevity.\nIf practiced often, within three years, one attains the **Way of Immortality**, a body of eternal life and enduring vision.\n\nFor **Fire-born** individuals, select **Gengyin** (庚寅, Metal Day) or **Wuyin** (戊寅, Earth Day), recite the **Wood-Earth** incantation, and walk the Five Stars five times to receive the longevity incantation.\nOften on **Jiawu** (甲午, Metal Day) or **Renwu** (壬午, Wood Day), establish **Wu** and walk the Five Stars to dispel calamities and diseases, ascending to the Palace of Life, Honor, and Sovereignty.\nRecite the incantation to dispel calamities, walk the Five Stars nine times, and chant the Five Phase blessings, eighteen verses each.\n**Note:** As before.\nRecite the **Metal-Wood** incantation, and **virtue/power** and blessings will assist—thus, the **Fire-born** body attains longevity.\nIf practiced often, within three years, one attains the **Way of Immortality**, a body of eternal life and enduring vision.\n\nFor **Metal-born** individuals, select **Guiwei** (癸巳, Water Day) or **Dingwei** (丁巳, Fire Day), recite the **Water-Earth** incantation, and walk the Five Stars five times to receive the longevity incantation.\nOften on **Yiyou** (乙酉, Wood Day) or **Jiyou** (己酉, Earth Day), establish **You** and walk the Five Stars to dispel calamities, overcome hardships, and eliminate diseases, ascending to the Palace of Life, Honor, and Sovereignty.\nRecite the incantation to dispel calamities, walk the Five Stars nine times, and chant the Five Phase blessings, eighteen verses each.\nRecite the **Water-Earth** incantation, and **virtue/power** and blessings will assist—thus, the **Metal-born** body attains longevity.\nIf practiced often, within three years, one attains the **Way of Immortality**, a body of eternal life and enduring vision.\n\nFor **Earth-born** individuals, select **Bingshen** (丙申, Fire Day) or **Renshen** (壬申, Metal Day), recite the **Fire-Metal** incantation, and walk the Five Stars five times to receive the longevity incantation.\nOften on **Jiazzi** (甲子, Metal Day) or **Bingzi** (丙子, Water Day), establish **Zi** and walk the Five Stars to dispel calamities, overcome hardships, and eliminate diseases, ascending to the Palace of Life, Honor, and Sovereignty.\nRecite the incantation to dispel calamities, walk the Five Stars nine times, and chant the Five Phase blessings, eighteen verses each.\nRecite the **Fire-Metal** incantation, and **virtue/power** and blessings will assist—thus, the **Earth-born** body attains longevity.\nIf practiced often, within three years, one attains the **Way of Immortality**, a body of eternal life and enduring vision.\n\nFor **Water-born** individuals, select **Gengshen** (庚申, Metal Day) or **Jashen** (甲申, Water Day), recite the **Wood-Water** incantation, and walk the Five Stars five times to receive the longevity incantation.\nOften on **Renzi** (壬子, Wood Day) or **Jiazzi** (甲子, Metal Day), establish **Wu** and walk the Five Stars to dispel calamities, overcome hardships, and eliminate diseases, ascending to the Palace of Life, Honor, and Sovereignty.\nRecite the incantation to dispel calamities, walk the Five Stars nine times, and chant the Five Phase blessings, eighteen verses each.\nRecite the **Wood-Metal** incantation, and **virtue/power** and blessings will assist—thus, the **Water-born** body attains longevity.\nIf practiced often, within three years, one attains the **Way of Immortality**, a body of eternal life and enduring vision.\n\nFor those born under the Five Phases, each should follow their native Phase, calculating and selecting what harmonizes with their generation.\nPractice for one year, and the body will be free of a hundred ailments.\n**Note:** Also, one year repels misfortune, two years repels war, three years removes the register of death, and four years refines the essence of the **Way**, all aiding the body. The Five Stars of Heaven each transform into human form, descending to teach the true **Way** to mortals. When one attains the true essence of Earth and completes their cultivation, the Five Elders descend to welcome them, ascending to the Golden Gate, assisting the later Sage Sovereign as ministers of the Celestial Ruler.\n\nUntil the completion of forty-nine years, one may ascend if they wish.\n**Note:** If one does not wish to ascend at forty-nine, they may instead remain in the mortal realm for leisure, requesting their original teacher to bestow an official title among the immortals. Thus, they may enjoy themselves without concern for marital or familial affairs, so long as their heart never strays from the **Way**, and the **Way** never strays from their heart.\nThey may also serve as officials in the world, with promotions unhindered.\n\nIn antiquity, the Immortal Ancestor Laozi served as a teacher to emperors across generations, also holding the positions of Prime Minister and Chancellor. He served sixty-four sovereigns during the Yin and Zhou dynasties, thrice as the **Zhushi** (柱史, a high official), and four times as Prime Minister. He nurtured eighty-two consorts and had three hundred sixty descendants. Seven hundred fifty-nine years later, he ascended to become the **True Person of Supreme Peace**, titled **Later Sovereign of the Golden Gate, the Celestial Jade Emperor of the Dao**.\n\nThe **Celestial Jade Emperor of the Dao**, the **Later Sovereign of the Golden Gate, the True Person of Supreme Peace**, addressed the **Supreme Master of the Way** Wang Zongzhen, **Celestial Master Zhang**, and **Master Shansheng**, saying:\n\n*\"You wish to become the **Way’s Teacher for All Beings**—a wondrous method to guide mortals. The **Supreme Master of the Way** can indeed teach humanity.*\n\n*According to the **Record of the Later Sovereign of the Golden Gate’s Supreme Peace**, it was on the seventh day of the third month of the second year of Han An that the **Later Sovereign of the Golden Gate** instructed twenty-five **Supreme Masters of the Way**, bestowing upon them the **Divine Spirit of the Attendant Immortal**, with countless chariots and cavalry of **qi** and **Way**—their number unknown. They ascended in clouds of purple **qi**, adorned with five-hued floating silks, until the instruction concluded, and suddenly vanished from sight.*\n\n*Thus, the **Supreme Masters of the Way** knelt and rose to speak: \"Our humble minds are dim and unenlightened. We do not understand the **Dao’s** methods and laws, having often transgressed and erred. We fear incurring blame, so we dare not become teachers and transmit the **Great Dao’s True Law**.*\n\n*Today, by Your grace, we receive blessings spanning a thousand ages. Fortunate indeed are we to encounter the **Dao’s** benevolence, to be mercifully granted the opening of instruction, and to awaken from our deafness to hear. After hearing, we will dare to follow the Law and transmit the **True Dao of the Immortals**.\"*\n\n*The **Dao Emperor** replied: \"Those who aspire to the **Way** with devoted hearts dwell in mountain forests or quiet chambers, burning incense and reading scriptures*—*the **Dao Books**, which the world calls **Jing**—*and observing pure abstinence with vegetarian meals. Some may even fast entirely, abstaining from grains for thirty, forty, fifty, or sixty years, until they perish from old age or illness. Others may dwell in the world, gathering many people, building grand towers and pavilions, expending their **virtue** in earthly labor—thousands or tens of thousands of rooms, towers a hundred feet high—yet they too will decline and die.*\n\n*How many more such as these! Do they not wish to attain the **Way**? Yet their aspirations and efforts only further alienate them from the **Way**, drawing them farther away.*\n\n*All beings rely on the false **qi** of **Yin** and **Yang**, forming their bodies and receiving life. When the gestation is complete, they are born, and their birth is calculated by the **Five Phases** of their destiny.*—*Why so? The year is one, the month is two, the day is three, the hour is four, and counting the month of conception as the mother’s **Phase**, this makes five.*\n\n*After birth, as they grow, it is the **Five Phases** that rule their flourishing.*—*When a person reaches their prime, the **Five Phases** mutually support each other without opposition. But when decline and misfortune come, the calculated **Five Phases** indeed clash, as the **Later Sovereign of the Golden Gate** has spoken.*\n\n*Some may even face the **Five Phases’** utter destruction*—***rest** meaning extreme decline and hardship, **extinction** meaning calamity striking to annihilate them in the pool of life. You must know this early if you seek the **True Dao**.*\n\n*Even if you have a lifespan of three, five, or six hundred years, you are not yet the **True Person**. You must draw near to the **Three Celestial Platforms** and distance yourself from the **Five Phases**.*—*The **Five Phases** of the **Zhou** are the enemies that harm the body, while the **Three Celestial Platforms** are the divine protectors of the soul and spirit. To distance oneself from the **Five Phases** is to practice the **Dao’s** methods of isolation, while to draw near is to preserve the **Three Combinations** of life.*\n\n*By storing the spirit to guard the body and severing the **Five Phases’** harm, you will avoid the peril of death. Even if you slightly align with the **True Person’s Dao**, you may transmit this method, instructing disciples to become **True Persons** of the future.*\n\n*You must tread the **Seven Stars of the Earth’s Measure**—*the **Great Dipper** born from **Yu’s Step**—*and regulate the **Five Phases**.*—*The **Seven Stars of the Earth’s Measure** are the **Great Dipper**, and the **Five Phases** are the **Great Golden Talisman’s** robes, found in the **Upper Scroll of the Flowing Pearl’s** Step Halter.*\n\n*You must ascend the **Three Celestial Platforms**.*—*Though treading the **Seven Stars of the Earth’s Measure** does not require the **Three Celestial Platforms’ Step**, you must perform the **Three Steps of the Three Celestial Platforms**—each step containing three traces, nine traces in total, known as **Yu’s Step**.*—*This is the **Way’s** teaching to **Xuanyu**, hence its name. It is the essence of **Yu’s Step**, with three steps and nine traces.*\n\n*You must enter the **Heavenly Gate**.*—*For those who aspire to the **Way**, first they must align their hearts, sit in stillness within an empty chamber, and tread the **Seven Stars of the Earth’s Measure** seven times. Then, they step down to the **Three Celestial Platforms**, performing **Yu’s Step** nine times—three steps and nine traces—before storing themselves within the **Heavenly Gate**, thus ascending to the **Flying Step of the Heavenly Pass**.*\n\n*Each has their own oil, and each day’s practice is detailed in their respective scriptures. When flying, they must do so three or five times.*—*Three refers to the **Three Primordial Generals**, and five refers to the **Five Phases**. The three must store the **Three Primordial Generals** to emerge, treading the **Seven Stars of the Earth’s Measure** together and capturing the malevolent and destructive forces among the **Three Phases** of heaven, earth, and humanity that seek to harm me.*\n\n*Store them as in the **Flowing Pearl’s Diagram**. Again, as with the **Three Combinations** of **Containment, Expansion, and Unity**, use them to defend and protect the body. Among the five stars, there is the **Star of Calamity**, which constantly plots to harm my life and body. Whenever you tread the **Flying Step** or before sleeping each night, lie on your back and think of the **Five Virtue Generals** in their chariots.*\n\n*The **Eastern Azure Dragon General**, eighty-one zhang in height, commanding eighty-one million soldiers, stands at my left to guard and ward off, bow drawn and arrows ready. The **Western White Tiger General**, thirty-six zhang in height, commanding thirty-six million soldiers, stands at my right, holding a bow and crossbow. The **Southern Vermilion Bird General**, sixty-four zhang in height, commanding sixty-four million soldiers, stands before me, horn blaring in advance, soldiers wielding blades. The **Northern Dark Tortoise General**, twenty-five zhang in height, commanding twenty-five million soldiers, stands behind me, striking drums and bearing gongs, soldiers holding staves to guard my rear. The **Central Yellow Court General**, twelve zhang or seventy-two zhang in height, commanding twelve million or seventy-two million soldiers, stands before or behind me, defending my body.*\n\n*If malevolent stars, evil constellations, or the evil spirits and demons of heaven, earth, and water—along with wicked humans—plot in darkness or strike in light to harm me, the **Five Virtue Generals** and their soldiers, with the **Three Primordial Generals**, will unite in heart and strength, capturing and exterminating them utterly, so that they vanish as if by decree. Their destruction will be swift, like frost meeting the sun—exhausted and dissolved entirely.\"*\n\nIn the left hand’s first finger, at the middle joint, lies the **Upper Celestial Gate**[*].\n*Note: The Celestial Gate’s Nine Stars of the Dipper (九星斗), known as the \"Flying Step Heavenly Restraint\" (飞步天纲) meridian.*\n\nIt governs **punishments and calamities**.\n*Note: Employ the Three-Five Method—expel the malevolent stars and qi of punishments afflicting my own body, as well as the disasters of the Five Phases’ mutual assaults, and all celestial stars that oppress me. All must be countered by pacing the Nine Steps (禹步) nine times, invoking the talisman of a particular star, and summoning that star from Heaven to rescue my own fate (宿). Prevent it from violating my fate. For instance, if a certain star (e.g., 金) invades like a thief, fear the Fire Star (火星). When the Fire Star assaults the fate where I was born, I implore the Water Star (水星) to save my natal fate.*\n\nThe method for summoning the Water Star is as follows: On a **Child Day** at **midnight**, when the star and moon are visible, exit through the northern door of your dwelling, grasp tightly, hold your breath, and gaze upward at the **Vermilion Star** (辰星), bowing three times.\n\nThen recite:\n*\"I, [Name], aged [X] years, born in the [Month] of [Year], my natal fate [Star] is now tormented and harmed by the Wandering Fire Star (荧惑火星). I now beseech the **Purple Enclosure Celestial Sovereign** (紫微天皇君) and the **Divine of the Northern Pole’s Vermilion Star** (北极辰星之神) to subdue and extinguish it, lest it violate or touch my natal fate (本命之星) or the fate governed by my birth hour (生日所管之宿). May they swiftly rescue and deliver me, driving the Fire Star’s essence to retreat in haste, scattering its malevolent qi, which shall then dissipate. I dare not betray the **Supreme Sage’s** favor.*\n\n*I pray for Your grace to grant me longevity and enduring vision, a secure household, and I dare not betray the **Supreme Sage’s** favor, the **Purple Enclosure Celestial Sovereign’s** grace.*\n\nThen perform the Nine Steps (禹步) once, and three times the **Earthly Restraint** (摄地纪). Adjust the clothing, rotate the **Celestial Gate** (天关), and point to the Wandering Fire Star (荧惑) nine times, invoking the Water Star’s talisman, while preserving the **Nine Abysses Great Sea** (存九泉大海) to sever and extinguish it.\n\nThen pray:\n*\"The Five Phases push one another; Metal and Wood strike in opposition.\nWater and Fire extinguish mutually—copper lips, iron tongues.\nThose who resist me shall perish. So it is decreed.\"*\n\nIn the *Liu Zhu* (Flowing Pearl) Upper Scroll, it is recorded:\n\n*\"The **Supreme Sage** first instructed the **Purple Enclosure Celestial Sovereign** (紫微天帝), who then inscribed the **Supreme Sage’s** (後聖君) talismans in red—these are the prayers for blessings. The remaining four stars (余四星) mutually restrain one another; their explanations are detailed later.\n\n**Prayers for Blessing and Auspiciousness** (修求福):\n*The **Supreme Sage** (後聖君) taught the **Purple Enclosure Celestial Sovereign** (紫微天皇君), saying: \"To cultivate the mind (修志心), always maintain thoughts of stillness and reflection (常思静念). Imagine your own divine light (自身神光) transforming into the **Northern Dipper** (北斗) Star, perpetually hovering above your forehead (常悬额上). When retiring at night, reflect on it once before sleeping (夜一度思便卧), and during the day, also preserve the **Northern Dipper** in mind (白日亦存北斗), applying its talismans to your body (為配衣於身上).*\n\n*After three years of such practice, you shall attain communion with the **Divine** (通神), and the heavens and earth will bestow blessings (天地降福). The sun and moon will shine brightly in your honor (日月为之照明), the Five Stars will align to bring you fortune (五星为之修福), and the Six Jia (六甲) will guard you. Some say: Swallow the talisman of the Six Jia (吞六甲符), and the Seven Auspicious Stars (佳七星) will turn the **Celestial Gate** (转关) for you. Whatever you point at (随手所指), it shall grant life to those in childbirth (救人生产立生), and life to those poisoned or dying from evil (救毒恶死立生). All matters shall follow your will (万事随手所指).*\n\n*Do not recklessly transmit these talismans to those unworthy of the **Dao** (非道之子), or you shall surely harm yourself (必反损身也).*\n\n*May your body escape the Three Calamities (令身出三灾).*\n\nThe **Three Calamities** are thus defined:\n\n**Celestial Calamities** (天灾) include sudden disasters, decline, misfortune, slanderous diseases, and afflictions from war and thunder.\n\n**Earthly Calamities** (地灾) arise from the *qi* of construction in one’s dwelling—whether from the clash of the Five Phases, structural flaws (such as uneven terrain, improper dimensions, or ill-placed doors), or external influences like neighbors’ constructions disrupting the *qi*. They also stem from marital incompatibility, betrayal by friends, feuds, contagious illnesses, or malevolent *qi* from ghosts and humans clashing in lawsuits or violence.\n\nSuch calamities, when trodden upon in the **Astronomic Steps** (蹑纪) and **Celestial Gate** (天门), or when the **Earthly Portal** (地户) is stepped upon, shall all be self-destroyed. If fear remains, perform the **Agricultural Steps** (禹步) and align with the **Polar Axis** (配斗), turning the **Celestial Gate** (转天关) and pointing—each shall be self-annihilated.\n\nThe **Five Torments** (五苦) or **Five Evils** (五恶) are thus addressed. If one’s body follows the sequence of **Metal, Water, Wood, Fire, and Earth** to dispel them, stepping in the **Cosmic Ropes** (步纲), trodding the **Astronomic Steps** (蹑纪), turning the **Celestial Gate** (转天关), and pointing to the **Five Stars**—beginning with **Metal**—first encircle the **Agricultural Steps Diagram** (禹步图) thrice, then point to the **Metal Star** five times, reciting the **Metal Star Incantation** (捻金星诀). Next, step upon the **Metal Star**, point to the **Wood Star**, step upon it, point to the **Earth Star**, step upon it, point to the **Water Star**, step upon it, and point to the **Fire Star**, reciting the incantation for each.\n\nThen recite the **Disaster-Dispelling Prayer**:\n*\"The Five Phases push one another—Metal subdues Wood,\nWater extinguishes Fire—thus it is.\"*\n\n—Excerpted from *The Flowing Pearl* (《流珠》).\n\nThus, day and night, one becomes a **Celestial Ancestor** (仙祖).\n*Note: Ancient scholars of the Dao, like those who study diligently to forget labor and fulfill their ambitions, attain office and wealth. The Daoist path likewise demands such assiduous effort and perseverance to achieve transcendence. These are the words of the Later Sage-King instructing his disciples.*\n\n**Laozi** says:\n*\"The methods for dispelling calamities through the Five Phases are numerous, but their subtleties follow an order. When the **Wood Star** is harmed by the **Metal Star** in one’s natal constellation and birth position—*\n*Note: For those born under the Wood Star (East, *Jia-Yi*, *Yin-Mao* positions—*Jiao, Heng, Shi, Fang, Xin, Wei*), on a *Wu-Wu* Fire Day at nightfall, when the star is visible, stand in the courtyard or outside the door. Grip firmly, still the *qi*, gaze upward at the **Mars Star** (荧惑), and bow thrice. Speak thus:*\n*'Subject [Name], aged [X], born on the [Month-Day], with natal star [X] and birth constellation [X], now suffers affliction from the **White Tiger Star** (太白金星), whose malevolent influence harms my natal star and birth constellation. I now petition the **Southern Pole’s DanTai Supreme Sovereign** (南极丹台太初君) and the **Southern Mars Star Deity** (南上荧惑星神) to subdue and annihilate this calamity, lest it assail my natal star or birth constellation. Swiftly rescue me, causing the **Metal Star’s essence** to retreat in haste and its malevolent *qi* to dissipate. I dare not betray the blessings of the Most Holy. May I be granted longevity, prosperity, and household peace, lest I betray the grace of the Supreme Sovereign DanTai.’*\n*Then perform the **Agricultural Steps** once, tread the **Earthly Measures** thrice, align the **Celestial Garment** (配衣), turn the **Celestial Gate**, and point to the **White Tiger Star** nine times, reciting the **Metal Star Incantation** nine times while visualizing the **Nine Furnaces of Fierce Fire** (九炉猛火) to subdue it. Then recite:*\n*'The Five Phases push one another—Metal subdues Wood,\nWater extinguishes Fire—thus it is.'*\n\n*When the **Water Star** is harmed by the **Earth Star** in one’s natal constellation and birth position—*\n*Note: The Water Star (North, *Hai-Zi-Chou*, *Dou-Niu-Nu-Wei*), the two *Seasonal Stars* (季星), appears on a *Xin-Mao* Wood Day at nightfall. Stand on the eastern perimeter of the house, grip firmly, close the *qi*, gaze upward at the **Jupiter Star** (岁星), and bow thrice. Speak thus:*\n*'Subject [Name], aged [X], born on the [Month-Day], with natal star [X] and birth constellation [X], now suffers affliction from the **Earth Star’s Suppression** (镇星土灾), whose malevolent influence harms me. I now petition the **Eastern Pole’s QingTai Primeval Sovereign** (东极青台太元君) and the **Eastern Jupiter Star Deity** (东上岁星之神) to subdue and annihilate this calamity, lest it assail my natal star or birth constellation. Swiftly rescue me, causing the **Earth’s essence** to retreat in haste and its malevolent *qi* to dissipate. I dare not betray the Most Holy’s blessings. May I be granted longevity, prosperity, and household peace, lest I betray the grace of the Supreme Sovereign QingTai.’*\n*—Note: The original omits ‘Sovereign’ (君).*\n\nTake one step in the **Yú-bù** stance, then stamp the **Dì-jì** three times. Adjust your clothing, then with the **Tiānguān finger**, press the **Earth Star** nine times. Nine times recite the **Earth talisman** while gathering soil from the Nine Ridges, breaking branches from the Nine Forests, and piercing them to block and suppress.\n\nThen pray thus:\n*\"The Five Phases interact in their cycles—so it is.\nThe **Fire Star** is harmed by the **Water Star**, assailing my natal constellation and birth host.\n*Note: Fire belongs to the South—**Sì, Wǔ, Wèi**—and the stars **Jǐng, Guǐ, Liǔ, Xīng, Zhāng, Yì, Zhěn** are its hosts.\nFire is the host of the Southern mansion.\nAt the beginning of a **Xīn-chǒu** Earth day, when the star host appears, face the **eastern-northern quadrant** of an empty, quiet space.

Swiftly rescue me, causing the **Water’s essence** to be sealed, severed, and retreat in haste, its malevolent *qi* to dissipate. I dare not betray the Most Holy’s blessings. May I be granted longevity, prosperity, and household peace, lest I betray the grace of the Supreme Sovereign Upper Platform’s Supreme True Lord.\"\n\nTake one step in the **Yú-bù** stance, then stamp the **Dì-jì** three times. Adjust your clothing, then with the **Tiānguān finger**, press the **Chen Star** nine times. Nine times recite the **Water talisman**. Gather soil from the **Three Mountains and Nine Ridges** to press and seal it, and sever the **Nine Abysses’ waters**, lest they flow. Then pray thus:\n*\"The Five Phases interact in their cycles—metal conquers wood, water extinguishes fire.\n*Note: An ancient Five Phases incantation.\nWater flows, earth is severed.\n*Note: From *Taiping Jinque Housheng Xuan Yuan Yuhuang Shangdao Jun*, reissued by Yín-jūn.\nFor those born under the Fire command, often harmed by the Water Star’s *qi* assaulting the body, within ten or five years, suddenly declining in a month or ten days, occasionally falling ill. Yín-jūn reported to the Jade Emperor, who transmitted this incantation, altering it from the previous version—now it is flawless.\nFire generates earth above, water dies from its own heat.\nWith a **copper mouth and iron tongue**, those who oppose me shall be slain, those who oppose Heaven shall perish.\nEarth and water contend, yet self-destruct in return.\nSo it is.\"*\n\nComplete the ritual as before.\n\n「金锁流珠引卷之十二竟 金锁流珠弘卷之十三 中华总真大仙宰王方平张道陵赵升王长司命李仲甫茅盈许玉斧等系代撰述 中华仙人李淳风注 五行六纪所生引中\n*Completion of the Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl [incantation] for the Twelve Volumes, expansion of the Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl [incantation] for the Thirteen Volumes.

The Daoist Master Lǐ Chúnfēng of the Chinese Realm annotated it. The Five Phases and Six Periods [of time] that generate [these stars] are detailed within.*\n\n太上老君告太极真人 徐来勒是也。\n*The Most High Lǎojūn instructs the Primordial Daoist Master [Tàijí Zhēnrén], and this is the method of Xú Lǎilè.*\n\n曰：五命之中，唯火命帝王则吉，似衰则病。\n*He says: Among the Five Celestial Mandates, only those born under the Fire Mandate as sovereigns are auspicious; if they appear to decline, then illness comes.*\n\n注：按《五星论》云：火命入小年多忧病，及长大时，忽不称意亦病，长助王时即吉。\n*Note: According to the Treatise on the Five Stars, those born under the Fire Mandate suffer anxiety and illness during their early years, and when they grow older, sudden discontent also brings illness. Only when they assist the sovereign in their prime do they flourish.*\n\n上仙皆用此法，转令常王盛。\n*The Celestial Masters all employ this method to transform their fate, ensuring the sovereign remains ever prosperous.*\n\n吾今说此妙法授卿，令卿常王，不衰不病也。\n*I now impart this wondrous method to you, so that you may always reign as sovereign, without decline or illness.*\n\n卿可常用庚寅、辛卯木日，可作小坛子，\n*You may frequently utilize days of the Gēngyín (Jupiter-Wood) and Xīnmào (Wood) commands, and construct a small altar,*\n\n注：按《五行相成记》云：夫醮祭作坛，须向用日前，先结土为坛，三级，高一尺五寸，古仙为之也。\n*Note: According to the Records of the Five Phases’ Mutual Generation, when conducting a ritual (jiào) to establish an altar, it must face the day’s cardinal direction. First, form the altar with earth in three tiers, standing one foot and five inches tall—this is how ancient Daoist Masters did it.*\n\n今志人修求，以黄土布地为坛，佳也。\n*Now, those who seek spiritual cultivation may spread yellow earth upon the ground as an altar, which is excellent.*\n\n此是作一时之用。\n*This is for temporary use.*\n\n但於净室空院之中，用黄色土乾筛，过布地为坛，祭醮为上。\n*However, within a pure chamber or empty courtyard, use yellow earth that has been sifted and dried, spread evenly upon the ground to form the altar. Rituals (jiào) conducted here are superior.*\n\n如不要，却扫除之，不妨。\n*If you do not wish to use it, simply sweep it away—it causes no hindrance.*\n\n高一尺五寸。\n*Note: The altar’s height should be visualized as one foot and five inches.*\n\n注：令人心存坛高一尺五寸，用得。\n*Note: Visualizing the altar’s height as one foot and five inches is effective.*\n\n用酒五升，或五斗。\n*Note: Use five sheng of wine for small rituals (jiào), or five dou for grand ones.*\n\n注：夫大醮五斗，小醮只五升，或三斗。\n*Note: For grand rituals (jiào), five dou of wine are used; for small ones, five sheng—or even three dou.*\n\n醮脯 脯用鹿脯，鸿鹭脯也。\n*Offerings of dried meat (fǔ) for the ritual (jiào): use dried venison or dried meat of the wild goose or egret.*\n\n一斤，五盘饼果，\n*One jin [of dried meat], five round cakes of grains or fruits,*\n\n三果及时新物等。\n*three fresh seasonal fruits, and other timely offerings.*\n\n酒杯一十五，\n*Fifteen wine cups,*\n\n席六领。\n*and six ritual mats (xí).*\n\n五方五领一领按前。\n*For the five directions, use one mat each, as previously described.*\n\n菜二十五楪，\n*Twenty-five dishes of vegetables (cài),*\n\n酒蹲一坐，\n*a single wine stand (jiǔdūn),*\n\n褥铺设如法。\n*and bedding arranged according to the ritual method.*\n\n画岁星君，带之左肘后。\n*Draw the image of the Star of the Year (Suìxīng), and wear it on your left elbow.*\n\n祭醮岁星君，以王火之意也。\n*The ritual (jiào) for the Star of the Year aims to reignite the Fire Mandate’s power.*\n\n然五君总请，俱会於坛，\n*Now, summon all five celestial lords—they will gather at the altar,*\n\n此即请客迎宾，共作福力之意是也。\n*which signifies inviting guests and benefactors to collaborate in generating auspicious power (fúlì).*\n\n须作启请王相辞文，读所请五星。\n*You must compose an invocation (qǐqǐng) and ritual address (xiàngcí) to the Five Stars, then recite them.*\n\n从岁星起。\n*Note: Begin with the Star of the Year.*\n\n注：文在下醮祭引中具说讫。\n*Note: The text is fully explained in the subsequent ritual (jiào) invocation.*\n\n一画岁星君一人，与青童一人，及木符三道，同袋系之於肘后。\n*Draw one image of the Star of the Year and one of the Green Boy (Qīngtóng), along with three Wood talismans (fú), and bind them together in a pouch on your elbow.*\n\n一云：香木为之，长一二寸，戴安头，\n*Some say: fashion these from fragrant wood, one to two inches long, and wear them on your head—*\n\n此谓之戴王入相，盛之无穷。\n*this is called \"wearing the Sovereign’s talisman to enter the celestial phase,\" bringing boundless prosperity.*\n\n注：香笺沈木堪，余木不可也。\n*Note: Only fragrant wood like sandalwood (shēnmù) or aromatic paper (xiāngjiàn) is suitable; other woods are not.*\n\n有人用金银为之戴头，且此即不入，\n*Some use gold or silver to craft these talismans and wear them on their heads, but this method does not work—*\n\n相成王盛，为火克金，\n*for when the talismans align with the sovereign’s power, it is because Fire overcomes Metal (Jin),*\n\n此入相克也。\n*but this is the opposite of what we seek: the talisman’s power being overcome.*\n\n异域香木及香不入中华，用者不堪，\n*Fragrant woods and incense from foreign lands do not belong in the Chinese realm; those who use them are unworthy—*\n\n犯道禁。\n*for they violate Daoist prohibitions.*\n\n注：夫大道中华正教，天地神仙之言，我中国神仙之乡人，\n*Note: The Great Dao of the orthodox Chinese teaching is the discourse of Heaven and Earth, gods and immortals. We, the people of the Chinese realm, are the native land of divine immortals—*\n\n不合夷戎蛮狄之宝，为神仙之器。\n*we should not use treasures from barbarians, as they are not suitable for the tools of gods and immortals.*\n\n不合烧异域熏臭秽毒烈辛之香。\n*Nor should we burn incense from foreign lands that is pungent, foul, or poisonous.*\n\n此香犯道禁，又非真人常修行之香也。\n*Such incense violates Daoist prohibitions and is not the kind that true immortals (Zhēnrén) habitually use.*\n\n真人爱紫微幽木之炁，笺沈之木，\n*True immortals cherish the subtle *qi* of the Purple Enclosure (Zǐwēi) and fragrant woods like sandalwood (shēnmù) and aromatic paper (xiāngjiàn)—*\n\n闻之皆喜。\n*they take joy in their scent.*\n\n胡狄之香，故皆恶。\n*Incense from barbarian lands is therefore all evil.*\n\n闻其炁，上真为之辛烈毒恶之炁也。\n*When one inhales its *qi*, even the highest immortals find it harsh, poisonous, and malevolent.*\n\n王桐栢谓王子登曰：苏上卿爱烧辛烈之炁，冲於中华天尊形象之前。\n*Wáng Tóngbì said to Wáng Zǐdēng: \"Sū Shàngqīng loves to burn pungent, harsh *qi*, which clashes with the divine image of the Chinese Celestial Sovereign (Tiānzūn) before him.*\n\n地府奏上，太上大恶之，\n*The Underworld reported this to the Most High, who greatly abhorred it,*\n\n退仙一等，\n*demoting the immortals one rank,*\n\n减位阶。\n*and reducing their celestial stations.*\n\n又长令掌西国陀佛台，永不离胡身，\n*Furthermore, he eternally commanded them to oversee the Ertao Platform (Tó Fó Tái) in the Western Realm, never to leave their barbarian forms,*\n\n胡地仙人也。\n*making them immortals of barbarian lands.*\n\n卿可能依此之法，\n*You can follow this very method,*\n\n十年位为真人，\n*and within ten years, attain the rank of true immortal (Zhēnrén),*\n\n一生无衰病之时也。\n*never to experience decline or illness in your lifetime.*\n\n徐君依行。\n*Xú Jūn followed this practice.*\n\n以笺香沈香为岁星，\n*Using aromatic paper (xiāngjiàn) and sandalwood (shēnmù) to fashion the Star of the Year, one inch long,*\n\n及镇星君、青童君三身，\n*along with the images of the Lord of the Constellation (Zhènxīng) and the Green Boy (Qīngtóng), three figures in total, each one inch long,*\n\n各长一寸，\n*each one inch long,*\n\n以锦袋盛之，\n*and stored in a brocade pouch,*\n\n戴头上，\n*to be worn upon the head,*\n\n五年并思存如见。\n*for five years, while also meditating upon them as if they were present.*\n\n三君为之，\n*The three lords (Zhènxīng, Suìxīng, and Qīngtóng) accomplished this,*\n\n下化为老人，\n*and transformed into an elderly man,*\n\n告徐君曰：公以身坚体王，\n*who told Xú Jūn: \"Your body is now firm and your sovereign’s power is fortified,*\n\n万邪不敢干也。\n*so that no ten thousand malevolent forces dare to approach you.\"*\n\n卿可能转乾坤於指足，\n*You can thus manipulate the Heavenly Circulation (Qiánkūn) through your fingers and toes,*\n\n转乾坤，是飞天纲，\n*for manipulating the Heavenly Circulation is the celestial law of flying through the skies,*\n\n蹑地纪是也。\n*and the earthly law of walking upon the ground.*\n\n指是掌诀，\n*The fingers are the key to the palm techniques,*\n\n皆在指节足，\n*all of which reside in the joints of the fingers and toes,*\n\n自身左右脚，\n*and the natural alignment of your left and right feet,*\n\n足步钢蹑纪是也。\n*for the steps of your feet are the iron-clad earthly laws.*\n\n纳三六於心胸，\n*Internalize the Three and Six within your chest—*\n\n注：三是三元将军，皆能纳入人身。\n*Note: The \"Three\" refers to the Three Primordial Generals (Sānyuán Jiāngjūn), who can all be internalized into the body.*\n\n六是老君六甲符，\n*The \"Six\" are the Six Talismans of the Celestial Mandates (Liújiǎ Fú) of Lǎojūn.*\n\n修行吞符，一十四年真人也。\n*Through cultivation and swallowing these talismans, one becomes a true immortal (Zhēnrén) in fourteen years.*\n\n如此十年，\n*Thus, within ten years,*\n\n白日升举为大仙真人也。\n*you will ascend in broad daylight to become a great Daoist immortal (Dàxiān Zhēnrén).*\n\n君初闻不识，\n*When you first hear this, you may not understand,*\n\n及其日久，\n*but as time passes,*\n\n渐有悟知。\n*you will gradually gain insight and comprehension.*\n\n为之八年，\n*After practicing for eight years,*\n\n白日上登太极，\n*you will ascend in broad daylight to the Primordial Dao (Tàijí),*\n\n仍传数弟子，\n*and also impart this knowledge to several disciples,*\n\n不转乾坤也。\n*though they will not manipulate the Heavenly Circulation.*\n\n犹数百岁，\n*Yet even they will live for hundreds of years,*\n\n后隐於山，\n*and afterward, retreat into the mountains,*\n\n而绝世也。\n*and vanish from the world.*\n\n土星被木星来害我本命生位宿者。\n*If the Earth Star is harmed by the Wood Star, or if the Wood Star attacks your native celestial mandate and birth position,*\n\n注：土虽居中位。\n*Note: Though the Earth Star occupies the central position,*\n\n为戊己而无正位，\n*it lacks a fixed position for the days of Wù and Jǐ (Earth days),*\n\n寄王在四季，\n*and instead, its sovereignty is entrusted to the four seasons,*\n\n辰戌丑未之地是。\n*specifically residing in the hours of Chén, Xū, Chǒu, and Wèi.*\n\n常以甲午金日，壬午木日，\n*Frequently, on days of Jiǎwǔ (Metal-Earth) or Rénwǔ

**Supreme Sovereign Lord of the Western Extremity’s Upper Platform (Tàisù Jūn)**, the divine spirit of the **Bright White Metal Star (Tàibái)**, to **subdue and utterly extinguish** the calamity, preventing it from ever arising again. May it not assail the star governing my life nor the constellation overseeing my birth.\n\n**Urgent salvation must be granted**, causing the **Wooden *qi*** to dissipate naturally, its disasters to vanish, and its malevolent *qi* to disperse immediately.

When it opposes a person’s **native star or birth constellation**, it brings **no auspicious outcome**, only **decline and calamity**. Whether one’s nature aligns with Metal, Water, Wood, Fire, or Earth, one must **constantly invoke the name of the Wood Star Sovereign**, wear an **image of the Wood Star’s form** on the **left elbow**, and **ingest a talisman of the Wood Star**. By doing so repeatedly, others sharing the same star or constellation will bear the harm, while you **escape unscathed**.\n\n**The Most High Lord Laozi instructed those seeking True Transformation:**\n*Note: Those seeking True Transformation—such as Xú Lèi, Guāng Miàoyīn, Cháng Guīyī Kǒushān, Lǐ Yuānbù, Zhēndìng Guāng, and Miào Hán Yuántōng—received this technique before attaining immortality, transmitted from the Western *Qiánzhú* (Kashmir) and other lands.*\n\n**\"You must now practice the Five Stars’ method.

The Five Stars are the **sovereigns of the Five Phases**, also called the **Five Celestial Sovereigns**—thus, it is called *Cháohuáng* (Morning Sovereigns).\n\n**Practicing for one year ensures the Five Virtues/Powers (*wǔdé*) reside within you; by two years, results will manifest.**\n*Note: The Five Stars manifest as the Five Virtue Generals—**Qīnglóng (Azure Dragon), Báihǔ (White Tiger), Zhūquè (Vermilion Bird), Xuánwǔ (Dark Turtle), and Huángtíng (Yellow Court)**.*\n\n**The schedule for the Morning Five Stars (Cháohuáng) is as follows:**\n- **January 6th, at *wǔ* hour (noon)**\n- **February 1st, at *shēn* hour (5–7 PM)**\n- **March 7th, at *zǐ* hour (11 PM–1 AM)**\n- **April 9th, at *chén* hour (7–9 AM)**\n- **May 15th, at *zǐ* hour (11 PM–1 AM)**\n- **June 3rd, at *wǔ* hour (noon)**\n- **July 7th, at *zǐ* hour (11 PM–1 AM)**\n- **August 4th, at *wǔ* hour (noon)**\n- **September 2nd, at *yín* hour (3–5 AM)**\n- **October 1st, at *yín* hour (3–5 AM)**\n- **November 6th, at *zǐ* hour (11 PM–1 AM)**\n- **December 12th, at *zǐ* hour (11 PM–1 AM)**\n\nOn these days, enter a **quiet, secluded chamber**, burn incense, face north, and **kneel and bow five times**. With focused mind, **invoke the names of the Five Celestial Sovereign Lords and their Consorts three times each**.\n*Note: For each set of five bows, mentally intone once: **\"[Name] True Sovereign Lord, [Name] True Sovereign Lady\"**—beginning with the **Mars (Ming) Star**—then bow again, proceeding in the order of the current constellation.*\n\n**The True Name of the Wood Year Star Sovereign Lord is:**\n**Dènglán**, with the courtesy name **Qīngníng**.\nHis Consort’s name is:\n**Bǎoróng**, with the courtesy name **Fēiyún**.\n\n**The True Name of the Fire Mars Star Sovereign Lord is:**\n**Wéitíng**, with the courtesy name **Sànróng**.\nHis Consort’s name is:\n\n**The True Name of the Metal (Jin) Tai Bai Star Sovereign Lord is:**\n**Liáolíng**, with the courtesy name **Zhènxún**.\nHis Consort’s name is:\n**Biāoyīng**, with the courtesy name **Xū’ēn**.\n\n**The True Name of the Water Chen Star Sovereign Lord is:**\n**Qǐxuān**, with the courtesy name **Jīngyuán**.\nHis Consort’s name is:\n**Xuánhuá**, with the courtesy name **Lóngé**.\n\n**The True Name of the Earth Zhen Star Sovereign Lord is:**\n**Zàngmù**, with the courtesy name **Dānyán**.\nHis Consort’s name is:\n**Kōngyáo**, with the courtesy name **Fēixián**.\n\n**Afterward, strike the teeth five times**, then rise and strike the teeth again. Loosen the headband and kneel in long obeisance, saying:\n\n*Note: Loosen the headband and place it on the ground, then kneel in long obeisance while holding a ritual ladle, focusing the mind on the Dipper (Big Dipper) constellation, eyes gazing at the furnace, softly speaking.*\n\n**I, [Name], of [State] [County] [Town] [Village],**\n*Note: Officials should state their rank; others should state their residence.*\n\n**a disciple of the Three Scenes of the Great Cavern of the Upper Pure Daoist Metropolis, the [Name] Master of [Name] Dynasty, the Little Talisman True Person, respectfully submit that I am [Name], born on the [Year] [Month] [Day], aged [Age].**\n\n**I humbly petition the Five Celestial Sovereign Lords and Ladies of the Sun and Moon, the High True Daoist Sovereign Emperor, and the Holy Sovereign Emperor of the Upper Pure, the Supreme Pure, and the Jade Pure—several generations hence.**\n\n**On the day of my birth in this mortal life, my seven generations of ancestors, along with my living parents, committed countless transgressions. After their passing, they were subjected to the scrutiny of the officials of the underworld. I pray for mercy and pardon, so that their restless spirits may ascend to present their case.**\n\n**Again, I, [Name], though longing for immortality while in the world, was ignorant of the scriptures and teachings, and thus committed countless offenses beyond recall.**\n\n**Moreover, since I entered the Dao and received the scriptures, I have violated my oaths, broken the precepts and prohibitions, and, as a mere ant-like remnant of life, have striven to uphold the sacred studies, hoping for blessings and felicitations. I now seek Your grace to purify my sins.**\n\n**I pray to be granted deliverance and to record twice my transgressions before the Celestial Sovereign, so that my crimes may be erased and my name removed from the black ledger.**\n\n**I pray to be blessed with a talisman, so that I may, along with the Five Stars’ True Ones, hasten to the Hua Chen, ascend to the Upper Pure, traverse the Jade Gate, and complete the rites.**\n*Note: Prostrate oneself in tears, beseeching for a long time, then adjust the headband, extinguish the incense, perform five sets of double bows, and depart without letting others know.*\n\n**If one steadfastly practices the Hidden Method of the Eternal Highest, invoking the Five Celestial Sovereign Lords, within five years, their forms will appear as if in a dream. In seven years, they will manifest fully and accompany one in all travels. By the fourteenth year, the Five Sovereign Lords will gather and descend together, riding in the carriage of the Jade Pure (Xuánhuá), with three layers of purple clouds, leading the Five Emperors and following the myriad True Ones. The Five Stars will escort them, ascending the White Day to the Chen, entering the court of the Jade Pure, and receiving the scriptures to become an Upper Pure True Person.**\n\n**The Five Phases (Wu Xing) generate and transform all things, each in its own way.**\n\n*Note: All things are born from the Five Phases, and they also return to the Five Phases—this is the forward and backward cycle.*\n\n**Those who enter the Communion of Spirits (Tong Ling) can also maintain their essence, govern and stabilize the human body, hence the transmission of their names.**\n\n*Note: The later sages passed down to Master Yin, who composed the *Five Phases Talisman Record* and left it in writing. The following is the text of that work.*\n\n**The *Five Phases Talisman Record* of Master Yin states:**\n**The Metal (Jin) Phase begins first,**\n*Note: The classics originally placed the Wood Phase first, but the later sages, following the Celestial Master’s *Flying Heaven Regulations*, established the order as Metal, Water, Wood, Fire, Earth—hence the order is not altered here.*\n\n**though in reality, the Wood Phase precedes it. Metal is the Tai Bai Star, which disperses downward to form the Metal Phase. The Metal Phase, capable of transforming essence and spirit, condenses the Yang Qi of the Tai Bai to generate the human form.**\n\n*Note: Yang Qi of the Tai Bai congeals to form humans.*\n\n**The Yin Qi of the Metal Phase generates the human form. This is the meaning of \"Shang\" (商). Shang refers to humans. Once humans are born, they naturally take the surname Shang. Having this surname, they then marry with descendants of the Yu (羽) surname and produce six sons. The eldest son resumes the ancestral surname Jin. Jin’s descendants cross the Eastern Sea to become the ruling class of a nation. The second son takes the surname Yin, a branch of the Jin surname. The third son takes the surname Xia, not the ancestor of today’s Xia clan, but the original character for \"upper and lower.\" The fourth son takes the surname Jiang, which is the Jiang of today. The fifth son takes the surname Zhang, the ancestor of today’s Zhang clan. The sixth son takes the surname Lang, the ancestor of today’s Hu and Kang clans. Over time, as the years pass, none have truly received this transmission.**\n\n**Even in the Han Dynasty, when Jing Fang expounded the Five Phases’ laws, he redefined the Five Surnames, yet it is unclear whether his arrangement was accurate.**\n\n**If one takes the original *Qi* (炁), the differences are certain. If one’s black *Qi* aligns with the surname, and they ingest Metal in accordance with its prescribed regimen, they will gain the benefits of prolonged youth and longevity.**\n\n**The *Record of Master Ma* states:**\n**Though the Metal Elixir Method involves refining Metal into liquid, it is not as effective as consuming its powder. The powder, when combined with water, is even more potent.**\n\n**These three methods have distinct scriptures, which are found in the *Upper Pure Sacred Scriptures*.**\n\n**Those who consume White Metal, Silver, or Lead will all align with their original surnames, and the methods will bring benefits. If they do not align, the methods will be ineffective.**\n\n**The Silver Powder Method, which involves consuming silver as Silver Ointment, is all based on silver. The methods are detailed in the *Upper Pure Sacred Scriptures*.**\n\n**Moreover, the method of subduing Lead as the *Purple River Cart* (紫河车法) is divine and mysterious, and is recorded in the *Inner Secrets of the Great Alchemy Talisman Scripture*—it is not further detailed here.**\n\n**The method of subduing Copper as the *Purple Powder, Purple Flower, Light Snow Elixir* is found in the *Sacred Scriptures of the Great Dragon-Tiger Talisman*.**\n\n**The method of subduing the Five Metals—Silver, Copper, Iron, Lead, etc.—as the *Return to Ancestry Method*, which returns to the original Metal (Jin), uses the method of refining Copper and Iron into gold, as recorded in the *Sacred Scriptures of the Great Dragon-Tiger Talisman*—this is not further detailed here.**\n\n**The method of refining Iron into *Divine Treasure Instruments*—swords, mirrors, tripods, and cauldrons—is found in the *Sacred Scriptures of the Treasure Sword Record*.**\n\n**Shang (商) refers to humans, as explained earlier. Humans are the Yang Qi of the Tai Bai dispersing and the Yin Qi congealing to form. This is analogous to the relationship between husband and wife.**\n\n**Metals and stones are the Yin Qi congealing in the Earth, forming substances. Thus, teaching those of the Shang surname to align with beneficial metals and stones enhances the refining of elixirs and aids in cultivation, bringing great benefit.**\n\n**Annotation:** *The following is a record from the Daoist Canon (正统道藏), detailing the teachings of Gongsun Huai-chang during the reign of the Yellow Emperor.*\n\n---\n\n**Record:**\nIn ancient times, during the reign of the Yellow Emperor, Gongsun Huai-chang refined gold into powder or elixir. Upon ingesting it, he attained an age of three hundred years without death, his appearance resembling that of a man in his forties. The Emperor then inquired why he had not yet ascended to become an immortal of the heavens.\n\nHuai-chang replied: *\"Though I was young and sought guidance, I had no master to follow. I searched all the famous mountains, even reaching the southern Flaming Continent, where the mountains of Bao-cang and Tian-tai—once called Bao-cang—lie. There, I encountered Hua-gai Zi, who taught me the arts of prolonging life. Yet, I have not yet attained the ultimate method of ascending to the heavens.*\n\n*However, among the five metals, I can transform and refine them into various elixir and medicinal methods, all of which grant longevity—thousands or even tens of thousands of years. Yet, none allow one to ascend as a true celestial immortal.\"*\n\nThe Emperor pressed further on the reason.\n\nHuai-chang answered: *\"Gold, by its heavy nature, cannot ascend to the heavens.\"*\n\nThe Emperor then asked for the methods.\n\nHuai-chang responded:\n*\"My methods include:\n- Refining gold into powder,\n- Refining gold into flower powder,\n- Refining gold into liquid,\n- Refining gold into *Su* [a refined elixir form],\n- Refining the five metals into liquid,\n- Transmuting the five metals into elixir,\n- Transforming the five metals into elixir liquid,\n- Refining the five metals’ elixir liquid into *Su*,\n- Refining honeyed five metals,\n- Refining the five metals into essence,\n- Refining into *Jin Tong Shen* [Golden Elixir of Divine Penetration],\n- Refining essence into *Yu Tong Shen* [Jade Elixir of Divine Penetration],\n- Refining *Qian-shi* [precious stones] into divine methods.*\n\n*All these methods grant only the arts of prolonging life, preserving youth, avoiding death, and wandering the Five Sacred Peaks. One’s descendants may live to eighty or seventy years, and their dwellings remain unharmed. Yet, if one exceeds these limits, they must relocate and change their name. Should they fail to do so, the Most High will not permit it.\"*\n\n「The Emperor bowed twice and said, *\"Please grant me this divine method.\"**\nHuaixu received it.\nThe Emperor rejoiced greatly and appointed Huaixu as his left and right Master.\n\nAll these methods are contained within the *Shangqing Ling Shu* [Scriptures of High Clarity]. Therefore, they are not detailed here.\n\nThe Most High Laozi spoke:\n*\"I often pondered the lower-grade earthly immortals who refine the five metals in flight, seeking the auspices of water and fire.\n**Note:** The five metals and water-fire are all refined through the method of *Taofei* [soaring in the Dao].\n\nYet, after years of effort, success or failure is decided.\n**Note:** Of those who refine in flight, only one in ten may achieve success, while many more fail.\n\nThe labor is arduous.\n**Note:** Those who refine gold, stones, and such under a master’s guidance, with proper technique, may attain the Great Elixir of the Upper Alchemy in nine years—this is called *Jiuxuan* [nine transformations].\nBut if they lack a master’s guidance, laboring blindly without regard to time, none shall succeed. Their toil reaches its utmost, their years and months wasted in vain. Thus, their suffering is extreme.\n\nIt is better to serve the *Five Star Ancestors* [of the five metals].\nThe Most High commands you to practice according to the sun, traverse the Five Stars, and ingest the *qi* of Taibai* [Great White Star] and the Five Stars. Then, advance further to ascend the Dipper, follow the *Tian Gang* [Heavenly Ropes] and *Di Ji* [Earthly Measures] methods, and you shall rise in broad daylight.\nThis surpasses those who merely burn and refine gold, stones, and mercury.\n\nNow, regarding the methods of the Upper Immortals for refining elixirs:\nThey depend solely on numerical precision.\n**Note:** The Five Stars (referring to the five celestial stars).\n\nThe *Dengzhen Yinjue* [Secrets of Ascending the True] fully explains the method of *Benxing Yixiang* [racing the stars and embracing the *qi*].\n\nTo *fei* [soar] through the Seven Dipper Stars, one must avoid calamity.\n**Note:** The Seven Dipper Stars—this is the method of *Di Ji* [Earthly Measures].\nWith the furnace fully activated, the steps and incantations complete, and the ritual attire prepared, this is called the *Seven-Dipper Earthly Measures* method.\n\nTo traverse the Nine Stars, one must stabilize the soul and spirit.\n**Note:** The Nine Stars—this refers to the Central Dipper’s nine stars, which are the *Yangming Yinjing* [Sunlight and Yin Essence] stars.\nOne must firmly grasp and guard the inner *qi*,\n**Note:** *Woguo* [holding firm], *Bihu* [closing the *qi*], *Fu Xin* [massaging the heart], and *Die Li* [stepping measures] are the ways.\nand ingest the vast and profound elixir.\n**Note:** The great immortals possess their own *Jin Jing* [golden essence] and *Yu Ye* [jade fluid]; this refers only to their practice of swallowing.\n\nOften, those who practice these methods—of the Five Stars, the Seven Dipper Stars, the Nine Stars, and the Three Primordials—\n**Note:** Practicing the methods of the Five Stars, the Seven Dipper Stars, the Nine Stars, and the Three Primordials, in fourteen years, their merit is fulfilled and they ascend. Many have already departed in broad daylight, leaving their homes behind.\n—find such joy.\n**Note:** *Zhī lè* [this joy] refers to the delight of those who pursue these refined methods.»\n\nThe nature of Heaven is such that it does not demand harsh trials or exhaust the spirit and body through labor. **Note:** This is taken from the words of *Laozi’s Inner Transmission*, addressed to the True Person of the Primordial Command.\n\nWhen the *Wood Star* [木行] first emerges, it scatters as *Sui Xing* [the Grand Cycle Star, 歲星], and this is the origin of *Wood* [木]. The *Wood Star*, once it can transform into *Jing* [essence], borrows the *Sui Xing*’s *Yang Qi* [yang qi], and thus gives birth to *Jiao* [the Horn Branch]. **Note:** *Jiao* [角] is the *Sui Xing*’s *Yang Qi* [yang qi] scattered, condensed into *Yin Jing* [yin essence], and thus becomes *Wood* [木].\n\nThe *Horn Branch* [角] born from the *Yang Qi* of *Water* [水], is the surname of humanity. Once there are people with this surname, they take it and intermarry with the children of *Zheng* [征], producing nine sons. The eldest son bore the surname *Zu* [祖], later changed to *Da* [大] and then to *Da Chao* [大巢氏]; the third son bore the surname *Dong* [东], the fourth *Ji* [姬], the fifth *Si* [姒], now collectively called *Zhou* [周]. The sixth bore the surname *Zhang* [长], the seventh *Chun* [春], the eighth *Ruo* [弱], now collectively changed—though not all can be listed individually. The ninth son bore the surname *Lu* [卢], now the *Jianqiu* [間丘家] clan.\n\nAll those who now bear the surname *Jiao* [角] are those who ingest the *Wood Star’s* elixir—*Muzhi* [木芝]—and align their nature with the *Wood Qi* [木炁], thereby attaining longevity and eternal life. The *Inner Transmission of Muzhong* [木公内传] states:\n\n*\"In the east, the Wood Star bears the surname Jiao* [角]. *It can give birth to all things, not just humanity. Its inherent nature opposes* *Jin* [金], *so it constantly fears* *Jin* [金] *and does not wish to undergo refining and smelting. The Five Metals* [五金], *when reversed, become the Six Bandits* [六贼], *and within the Five Viscera* [内五藏], *they cause emptiness, failing to guard the soul and spirit, as the bandits dwell within. One may ingest* *Yue Jing* [月精, moon essence] *and* *Tu Ying* [土之英, earth’s refined essence], *which are the* *Yingzhi* [英芝, elixir herbs]. *This comes from the wisdom of the immortals who drink water. Later, one may apply this to nurturing life.\"*\n\nThe *Nine Star System* [九星] begins with the *Wood Star* of the *Heavenly Court* [天庭], and those who practice early and diligently achieve success. The father of the nine sons was named *Xian* [先], with the surname *Jiao* [角]. *Jiao Xian* [角先] had two wives. The first wife bore nine sons, each taking their own surnames as noted before. The second wife also bore nine sons, but they did not separate and collectively retained the surname *Jiao* [角]. Today, according to the ninefold divisions of the eastern realm, they are known as the *Jiu Jiu* [九九, ninety-nine] lineage. The nine sons from each wife, scattered across the eastern seas or within them, are all descendants of the *Sui Xing*’s dispersion.\n\nThose who practice the *Dao* [Way] must understand the great efficacy of the *Wood Star*’s transformations. They should know that the realm where the *Jiu Jiu* [二九子] descendants reside is ruled by *Wood*’s *Huang* [皇, sovereign] *Fire* [火]. The *Wood Star* benefits those with the *Four Commands* [四命], especially the *Fire Command* [火命]—those who align with it achieve the highest success. Thus, *Fire* and *Wood* mutually reign: *Fire* is born from *Wood*, and *Wood*’s nature thrives in growth, finding harmony with *Fire*, so it naturally follows *Jin* [金] in strength. **Note:** *Jin* [金] overcomes *Wood* [木], so if one seeks *Wood* below, it will be attained. Next, those with the *Fire Command* [火命] receive blessings. Among the *Five Commands* [五命], only *Tu* [土] slightly fears *Wood* [木]. If one aligns with humanity’s expansive nature, then fear arises. However, within the *Five Star Palaces* [五星宫], they do not oppose each other—how much less so their star sovereigns! **Note:** The Five Stars often gather in the mortal realm to drink wine, yet they do not harm humanity, as the world knows. Their opposition lies only in the essence of their stars. Due to the inherent natures of *Jin* [金], *Wood* [木], *Water* [水], *Fire* [火], and *Earth* [土], and humanity’s ability to craft ritual methods and utilize them, there is no longer opposition between *Water* and *Fire*. Roughly, *Wood*’s nature is kind in seeking and receiving, so those who practice know this.\n\nThus, after the *Winter Solstice* [冬至] and before the *Establishment of Spring* [立春], one selects an auspicious day to sacrifice to the *Wood Star Sovereign* [木星君] first, then inviting the remaining five sovereigns in total. If practiced for five years, the star sovereign descends, receiving the *Wood Star’s* elixir herb—*Muzhi Yingzhi* [木英之芝]—growing in the courtyard. By eight years, the five sovereigns collectively descend with divine omens into the son’s dwelling. By fourteen years, the five sovereigns descend to welcome the son at the *Five Capitals* [五都], where he ascends the *Five-Colored Cloud Platforms* [五色霄台]. **Note:** The *Eastern Platform* [东青玉之台] of the *Jade Clouds*, the *Western Platform* [西向玉之台], the *Southern Platform* [南丹陵玉之台], the *Northern Platform* [北黑霄玉之台], and the *Central Platform* [中黄金玉之台]—each platform corresponds to its direction, with the *Eastern Platform* having nine days of observation, and the others following similarly. The *Jade Clouds*’ *Platforms of the Five Colors* [五色霄台] are where the immortals’ music is heard. Sacrificing to the *Wood Star Sovereign* [木君], if one attains success, it is due to the alignment with this method. The primary day is the *native day of the command* [本命日]. If that is not available, then *Gengyin* [庚寅] or *Renmao* [辛卯] days will suffice. For those with the *Earth Command* [土命], these days are not used; instead, *Jia-yin* [甲寅], *Yi-mao* [乙卯], *Wu-yin* [戊寅], *Geng-zi* [庚子], or *Ren-chou* [辛丑] days are chosen, as auspicious. One must use fifteen *leads* [席] of the *Sacrificial Array* [领], along with incense, flowers, lamps, and candles of seasonal fruits, or offerings of food and drink—all must be solemn and pure to invite the true descent of divine omens. **Note:** The *Fifteen Leads* [三五一十五] correspond to the *Fifteen Star Sovereigns* [十五君官精], collectively inviting them in one session, forming a *Fifteen-Array Platform* [十五盘]. Alternatively, there may be thirty-five platforms. **Note:** If one adds three platforms for the *Three Primordial Generals* [三元将军], six platforms for the *Six Celestial Stems* [六甲], three platforms for the *Six Memorial Generals* [六纪将军], one platform for the *Pillar of Heaven Great General* [柱天大将军], seven platforms for the *Nineteen Star Sovereigns* [十九星大众] and *Twenty-Eight Constellations* [二十八宿], and three platforms for the *Three Platform Star Sovereigns* [三台众星], *Nine Wilds* [九野], and all star officials, generals, officers, soldiers—then the total is eighty-one platforms. The *Sacrificial Array* [菜楪] must be set accordingly, as in a *fasting ritual* [斋楪].\n\nEighty-one cups of wine, fifteen cushioned incense burners with incense, and five *liang* of blended fragrance.\n**Note:** Exclude stinkwood, Buddhist incense, frankincense, and *jia-long nao* (elephant brain resin)—these emit noxious *qi*, and the Five Stars abhor them.\n\nUse paper to steep *Reduced-True* *Suhexiang* (agarwood), sandalwood, and cloves in wine jars, along with five fragrant censers and five tables with six sides. Forty-nine floral lanterns, or thirty-five, or twenty-eight, as one’s capacity allows.\n**Note:** The ancient emperors and feudal lords used thousands or hundreds—today’s forty-nine is already a reduced offering for those practicing asceticism. Even so, it remains modest.\n\nOne thousand *wen* in coins, or one hundred twenty *wen* for those of meager means. Alternatively, two thousand four hundred *wen*.\nEmperors and feudal lords would use ten thousand or twenty thousand, or thirty thousand forty thousand—this is the *settling-seated* coinage.\n\nOne bolt of plain silk; emperors and feudal lords would use one hundred bolts, or one thousand bolts.\n\nTwo *fen* of refined gold—emperors would use one *jin*, feudal lords one *liang*.\n\nTwelve boxes of rare fruits, precious woods, and ornate flowers. Emperors and feudal lords would use eighty-one boxes.\n\nOn a clear night of star and moon, construct an altar of yellow earth.\n\nWhen the altar is complete, the furnace is ignited, and the incantations are recited—*wenyi* texts are read separately as prescribed. Three recitations and nine libations are performed. The three recitations are the texts, and the nine libations are the offerings of wine.\n\nAfter the rites conclude, the Five Talismans are swallowed to seek the five virtues for bodily protection. The talismans are then dispersed, for failure to do so invites dark retribution.\n\nThe **Later Sage Emperor** proclaims the talismans of the Four Seasons and Five Phases, the Nine Heavens’ Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter Command Talismans, the Talismans of the Wood Phase’s Year Star Sovereign, the Fire Phase’s Mars Star Sovereign, the Metal Phase’s Venus Star Sovereign, the Water Phase’s Jupiter Star Sovereign, and the Earth Phase’s Stabilizing Star Talisman. These six talismans are entrusted to the **Bundle-Sea Child Sovereign** by the Later Sage Emperor.\n\nThe Child Sovereign is a Wood Commanded being, and thus the talismans are passed down to him, commanding him to refine them with the other Commanded beings.\n\nAll the above talismans are inscribed in cinnabar.\n\nThe **Most High Venerable Lord Lao** instructs the **Benevolent and Virtuous True Person**—\n*Note: The Benevolent and Virtuous True Person is a Western barbarian, now serving as the Later Sage’s Left Celestial True Person*—\n\n*\"The Wood Phase star’s qi thrives in generation. On days and hours ruled by the Wood Star, first align with the Wood Star, traversing all five stars. Twist the talismans of Metal, Water, Fire, and Earth.*\n\n*The Later Sage Emperor grants the Heavenly Master the Five Phase talismans of the Five Stars. The Wood talisman is on the left hand’s second finger, beneath the second joint, ascending to the second knuckle’s apex to command the Wood talisman. The Fire talisman is on the left hand’s third finger, at the third joint’s left edge, commanding the talisman at the joint’s center. The Earth talisman is on the fourth finger’s third joint. The Metal talisman is on the fourth finger’s third joint, commanding the talisman at the midpoint below the joint. The Water talisman is on the third finger’s first joint, commanding the talisman at the third division.*\n\n*This is the first Five Phase talisman. When performing rituals, use five-colored brushes to mark them repeatedly until the talismans are fully activated. Practice consistently. After three years, the Five Star Sovereigns descend to teach their children Dao refinement, granting all desires naturally.*\n\n*Those who attain the Dao need not act further—merely cherish the Dao, and the Dao will bestow its essence upon you.*\n\n*Perform the Five Stars’ Yu Step three times, then recite the Five Phase Incantations eighteen times in full. After nine days, you ascend to the Celestial Register, attain the Immortal Rank, and are named among the True Ones. You escape the Nine Calamities and Hundred Illnesses, the Three Corpses and Nine Vermin, malevolent ghosts, and slanderous schemes, entering the Immortal Realm forever.*\n\n*After nine years—*\n*Note: Each spring’s third month, practice for nine days monthly. This method spans from the Celestial Ropes to the Three Enclosures and Five Stars.*\n\n*—perform the Yu Step and strike the fingers. If malevolent ghosts appear, they will be crushed under a fifteen-*jin* fist. If they dare speak, the Northern Dipper will strike them down—do not misuse this power.*\n\n*The Year Star is subject to the Nine Stars of the Northern Dipper, the True Consorts, and the Lovely Daughters. The Year Star Sovereign, the Five Direction Star Sovereigns, the Northern Dipper’s Nine True Sovereigns, their True Consorts, and the Five Star Sovereigns’ Ladies—*\n*Note: True Consorts are the Northern Dipper’s True Consorts; Ladies are the Five Star Sovereigns’ wives.*\n\n*—along with the assembled multitudes, supplement the ranks of the Upper Clarity True Persons.*\n\n*After fourteen years, the residence is elevated, and wife and children ascend with you.*\n\n*[End of] Volume Thirteen of the Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl Scroll*\n*[End of] Volume Fourteen of the Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl Scroll*\n\n「Its weight totals **150 catties** [1]. If one practices the **Constant Fist** [2], it subdues and kills malevolent ghosts—if they dare speak, the Northern Dipper will strike them down, but one must not misuse this power. The **Year Star** [3] is subject to the Nine Stars of the Northern Dipper, the **True Consorts**, and the **Lovely Daughters** [4], and so forth.\n\nThe **Year Star Sovereign** [5], along with the Five Direction Star Sovereigns, the Northern Dipper’s Nine **True Sovereigns** and their **True Consorts**, and the Five Star Sovereigns’ **Ladies** [6],—\n*Note: True Consorts are the Northern Dipper’s True Consorts; Ladies are the Five Star Sovereigns’ wives.*\n\n—together with the assembled multitudes, supplement the ranks of the **Upper Clarity True Persons** [7]. After fourteen years, the residence is elevated, and wife and children ascend with you.\n\n---\n\nThe **Grand Sage of the Unified Dao**, **Master Sovereign** Zhang Fangping, **Daoist Lord** Zhang Daoling, **Master** Zhao Sheng, **Commander** Wang Chang, **Master** Li Zhongfu, **Master** Mao Ying, **Master** Xu Yuzhu and others [8] are those who have compiled this text in succession. **Daoist Master** Li Chunfeng annotated it. The **Five Phases** [9] and **Six Periods** [10] produce the **Way’s Essence** below. The **Later Sage Emperor** [11] instructed the **Twenty-Nine True Persons of Mysterious Isles** [12], saying: *\"You wish to be the Teacher of Heavenly and Human Beings; you must transmit the **Dao’s Key** and cultivate the **Inner Secrets of True Personhood**, bestowing them upon the **Aspirants** [13]. One must not recklessly transmit this to others, lest it invite calamity upon oneself.*\n\nFor indeed, the **True Essence**—when humans transmit these **Five-Phase True Secrets** and the **Way of Talismans, Rituals, and Offerings** [14], it is also the **True Essence**. Moreover, all the **Key Secrets of True Personhood** [15] and their **High Dao**, their most guarded mysteries lie in the **twisting of the fingers**, the **attunement of the ritual robes**, the **rotation of the Dipper**, and the **pointing to Heaven** [16]. Those who can **fly through clouds and traverse rain**, who can **uproot and snap trees**—these are **Dragons** [17]. Aspirants who obtain these **wondrous Dao Secrets**—if they merely perform the **Stepping Flight** [18],—\n*Note: Stepping Flight refers to the **A-yu Step** [19].*\n\n—the **A-yu Step** [20], **twelve years** of practice, **attunement of the ritual robes**, the **twisting of the Dragon Secrets**, and the **rotation of the Heavenly Lock** [21]—will cause the target to fall dead at their touch. Though they can strike down, they must not act recklessly. Reckless action will forfeit one’s **Sage position**. Knowing this, one should not act.\n\nIf one were to act recklessly against another person, merely to play with one’s power for a moment, one would not realize that the **Dragon** [22] bears no guilt while the target dies, and the blame would instead fall upon oneself and even implicate one’s **Teacher** [23]. One must **carefully examine** and **not act** without necessity. If an enemy comes to harm you and you cannot evade them, then you may use this method, but **quickly resolve the matter** afterward.\n*Note: The Later Sage Emperor bestows this secret only to those who aspire to the Dao, to safeguard their lives and families. This method of **Left Suppression, Right Release**—*\n*Note: Suppression refers to twisting the fingers of the left hand; Release refers to twisting the fingers of the right hand. The Later Sage Emperor taught the Celestial Master [24] the method of Left Suppression and Right Release, which can be used endlessly.*\n\n—is the **Refining of the River Vehicle** [25]. **Master Zhang Shaozhen** obtained the teachings of **Laozi, the Celestial Lord** [26], and was able to **delay his lifespan for a thousand years**, serving as a **pillar of stability for the mortal realm** and warding off calamities. Later, he did not ascend to Heaven, fearing the **Five Viscera** [27] might decay and disperse. He then employed **200 catties of green lead** [28].\n*Note: Excessive mercury is called **cup lead**; impure cinnabar is called **grind lead**, and both are unfit for use. Only the **I-yang** [29] and **Persian** [30] varieties are acceptable, with **purple cinnabar** being superior. This is highly potent.*\n\nHe placed **one inverted moon iron cauldron** [31] to the right, measuring the lead according to the cauldron’s size, and roasted it with **fierce fire**. When the lead had fully melted, he **stirred it thoroughly to the bottom**. In a short while, it would naturally turn into **green sand** [32]. Initially, when the fire was lit, the lead would sometimes form **green sand**, and sometimes fail to change. One must **stir continuously without pause**, and stop only when all has transformed. If the fire cools, the lead will revert to its original state.\n\nIf one wishes to **forcefully transform the lead into yellow flowers** [33], after the lead becomes **green sand**, one must **not extinguish the fierce fire**, but stir it continuously, and it will immediately turn into **yellow flowers of lead** [34]. Then, placing the **green sand** in a basin, one **gradually adds bitter wine** [35] and **refines it with a pestle**, using **sugar and vinegar**. If one does not use **strong, concentrated wine**, the **green sand** will become **fine, clear powder**. When finished, one **dries it on tiles** under the sun. After a short while, one **gently warms it with a low flame**, takes **imperial river sediment powder** [36], and **mixes it with the left flavor** [37]. Without this method, the **pill** cannot be formed. The lead, once dried, is placed into a **cast-iron pot**, covered above and below, and **roasted with fierce fire**. Using a **leather bag to pound the lead**, it flows through the **cast-iron channel**, and the **green sand** will immediately transform. One places a **cast-iron vessel** below to collect it, taking all until it is exhausted.\n\nIts color is **bright white**, named **Lead Grandson** [38]. After **eight reversals and nine rotations**, it turns **purple**. For every **catty of lead**, after **nine rotations**, it consumes **15 catties and 1 ounce**, yielding **1 ounce**. This is called **Jin Gong Dan** [39]—**Strong Lead Elixir** [40]. It is also known as **Purple River Vehicle**, **Golden Dog**, **Nine-Rotation Treasure**, and **Nine-One-Rotation Lead Essence**. Its uses are manifold.\n\nOther accounts are found in the *Upper Clarity Spirit Book* and the *Dragon-Tiger Rectified Talismans*.\n\nThe **Eastern Wood Star Sovereign** instructed **True Person of the Supreme Ultimate**, **Master Jie Ziliang** [41], saying: *\"When the apricot kernels are ripe, mix them with their skins and flesh, leaving them in a dry place. If the place is damp, use a **wooden tray** to contain them. Wait until the skins and flesh naturally dry up, until early autumn. Then, **cut two sharp, pointed holes** into them. When the **kernel is exposed**, roast it with **gentle fire**—when it makes a **hissing sound**, the **gold** emerges. Use a **bamboo knife** to collect it. A **round, one-inch piece** yields **one catty**, and it is used to make **A-yu Golden Elixir** [42].*\n*Note: The elixir is recorded in the *Upper Clarity Spirit Book*, which states that **yellow flower gold** is the true substance. The remaining gold is **mountain and river gold**, not the superior medicine.*\n\nThose who have not yet obtained the *Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl Upper Scripture* and this book cannot yet attain **True Personhood** and ascend to Heaven. Moreover, they can **delay their lifespan for two hundred years**, seeking the **Perfect Ones** [43]. This is the **most wondrous method of cultivation** above.\n\nThe **Refining** is fully explained in the *Upper Clarity Spirit Book*; no further annotation is needed.\n\n---\n\nThe **Later Sage Emperor** instructed **Yellow Stone Master** [44], saying: *\"You are a teacher for mortals; you know that the **Year Star’s Wood Essence** descends into the **Paulownia tree** [45]. At the moment when the **thunder’s initial strike** [46] echoes, **cut the eastern branch** as a **talisman-symbol** [47], and bestow it upon **Zifang** [48], to aid **Conqueror Liu Bang** [49] as his master. Would this not save the lives of **tens of thousands of people**? You are not one who performs **hidden virtuous deeds** without merit.\"*\n*Note: The *Flowing Pearl Outer Chapter* uses the **Paulownia talisman**, which is derived from this instruction. Zifang is **Zhang Liang**, the Han general and chancellor. He used **Yellow Stone Master’s strategies** to defeat **Strong Item** [50].*\n\n**Strong Item** [51] and the **Han House** [52] contested the **Mandate of Heaven**, killing **one hundred thousand soldiers** in their struggle. **Strong Item** was finally defeated. **Zifang** used his military prowess, **calculating the battles before and after**—**seventy more**—and **killing 560,000 soldiers**, while **subduing Strong Item’s remaining 400,000 soldiers**. He **did not repay the debt of death** [53], but later, **each one received their due**. Afterward, **Zifang** knew that the **Han House’s soldiers** were the **ones who had been killed first**, and that the **soldiers of Strong Item** were the **ones who had died in the dark** [54]. Thus, he praised **Zifang and Yellow Stone Master’s virtue** in safeguarding the lives of the multitudes.\n\nWith me and the **forty thousand multitudes**, we emerged without the **bloodshed penalty**, each able to die in peace and become **pure ghosts**. Reflecting upon this, the **weight of thought** and the **greatness of the deed** are profound.\n\nWhen the **multitudes** were fully revealed to **Taishan Jun**, the **Lord of Taishan** knew of the matter. After reporting to **Heavenly Oracle** and the **Most Holy Primordial Jade Emperor**, the **Supreme Dao Lord**, the decree was issued to **transcend Zifang and Yellow Stone Master**, granting them **immortality as celestial officials**. Though they did not ascend to the **bright daytime heavens**, they attained **embodied dissolution**—**wooden dissolution**, departing as corpses.\n\nThey were **restored as the Celestial Consorts of Qingcheng Mountain’s Immortal Realm**, a feat of **Mars’ qi-transformation**.\n\n**Warned against**, the **perfected sage** who practices the Dao should only perform **subtle deeds**—rescuing the sick, aiding the desperate, relieving poverty, and mediating conflicts between warring factions. They should **dissolve and disperse** those entangled in strife, and **protect the world** from harm by **divine dragons, ghosts, and malevolent spirits**, as well as **calamities of flood and drought, epidemics, and curses**—such as **nightmares, tongue-twitching, and hexes**. Such deeds carry **vast and wondrous virtue**.\n\nThe **Most Holy Lord** declared to the **Celestial True Persons**: *\"Those who cultivate to perfection, with single-hearted devotion to the Dao, attaining **True Dao and True Qi**, dissolving **unrighteous qi**, accumulate **infinite and wondrous merit**.\"*\n\n**Laozi** instructed **Yu** (注: *At Yu’s time, Laozi was Ji Kezi’s descendant, teaching the Dao to Shun and Yu.*):\n*\"The essence of **Mars** manifests as a **boat**, drifting across the **Stygian wilderness**, seeking the **Central Water’s source**.*\n\n*Again, the **soul of Mars** shapes the **pattern of Heaven and Earth**.* (注: *Pattern of Heaven—maplewood. Pattern of Earth—jujube wood.*)\n\n*When these two woods unite, they are **engraved** into the **stars and deities of the cosmos**, encompassing **all of Heaven and Earth**. Their revolving wheels interweave, restraining **wicked men and malevolent ghosts**, as **hand obeys mind**. They can **command all things**, **subdue gods and spirits**, **reverse Heaven and turn Earth**, and **assist me in ascending the Dao of Earthly Foundations and Heavenly Principles**.*\n\n*They can **tame tigers and leopards**, **command ten thousand soldiers**, **overpower the wicked**, **halt winds and rains**, **subdue serpents and dragons**, and **reverse malevolent speech**—all verified by their effects.*\n\n*To craft this **Pattern** brings **pure fortune** to the virtuous. The **filthy and unfilial** must never use it.*\n\n*If one touches it before death, they will die afterward. Such wood is **unfit for crafting the Pattern**, nor should it be used for **deceased patterns**. One must never gaze upon them.*\n\n*How much worse for the **common and foolish** to take and reuse them—this is **great impurity**! Those who practice the Dao improperly are thus condemned.*\n\n*The **Pattern** must not be seen by **monks or nuns**; to do so is **impure and taboo**.*\n\n*If a **Daoist** must use it, they must first **don heavy ritual robes** and remain outside for **twenty-five days** before approaching. If using it urgently, they must **purify impurity** by swallowing the **Purification Impurity Talisman**, then wear **auspicious robes** before use.*\n\n*If **unfilial, monks, nuns, or pregnant women** see or handle it, they must **never touch or employ it**.*\n\n*If a **woman** receives the **Pattern**, she must **measure her own use carefully**—if she falls ill afterward, she must **not touch it again** until the illness subsides.*\n\n**Zhenren Wang Ziqiao**, the **True Person of the Paulownia Tree**, instructed his **second daughter**:\n*'The **Pattern** is for **emergency use**. When sickness arises, swallow the **Purification Impurity Talisman**, drink **Purification Impurity Water**, and **recite the incantation**—thus it is effective.*\n\n*It can **assist those who walk the Dao**, mastering **prohibition and restraint**, rendering them **omnipotent**. Its **divine power is verifiable**.*\n\n*There are **separate scriptures and diagrams**—I shall now transmit to you the **Taiyi** [Supreme One].\"*\n\n「**Note:** The **Patterns** of the Thunder Lord for the Four Seasons, the *Liu-Ren* and *Liu-Jia* [Six Ren and Six Jia], the Eight *Man* and Six *Rong* [Mystical Protective Spirits and Martial Deities], were transmitted to **Yu** [Great Flood Controller].\n\n**Yu** refined them into a **ten-scroll scripture**, expanding it to **forty-nine scrolls**, which he titled *The Yellow Emperor’s Gathering of Spirits*.\n\n**Note:** This is the *Gathering of Spirits* in its Upper, Middle, and Lower sections, as well as the *Yellow Emperor’s Pattern Scripture*.\n\nLater **sages and rulers** conferred upon the **Celestial Master** [天師] the *Ten-Scroll Pattern Scripture* and the *Three-Scroll Liu-Ren Talismans*, instructing:\n\n*\"When the **Wood Star’s essence** scatters below, upon the **maple tree’s branches**, the **Pattern** that does not grow taller than people is the **Ling Pattern** [灵式], while the one that towers above is the **Xiong Pattern** [凶式].\nThough the **Xiong Pattern** is harmful, it does not **assist in spiritual response**—if it does not align with the **Pattern’s true nature**, it is not a **Pattern**.\n\n**Obtaining it**, one must follow the **scripture’s instructions**, perform **sacrificial rites** [祭醮], and **employ it to aid the Dao** and benefit others—**as the divine responds with certainty**, none shall fail to succeed.\n\nIts **power matches that of Heaven and Earth**, and its **control is swift as a breath**.\n\n**Note:** The **Pattern**’s upper section corresponds to **Heaven**, its lower to **Earth**; the **divine stars and celestial spirits** of Heaven and Earth are all inscribed and deployed within it, just as the **functions and transformations** of Heaven and Earth themselves.\n\n**Common folk** who practice it may **attain the Dao and become immortals**, and **ascendants** have observed them.\n\nFurther, it is said: *\"When the **Wood Star’s essence** first scatters, it transforms into a **jujube tree** [枣树].\nThe **jujube tree** is the **mother of all trees**, and the **maple tree** is the **father of all trees**.\n\n**Note:** The *Pattern Scripture* states: *\"The **maple tree** is the **longest of all trees**, and the **jujube tree** is the **mother of all trees**.\"*\n\nOnly **maple or jujube trees** that have aged for many years are **suitable for the Pattern**—**how much more** so for those who **cultivate the Pattern** or **refine the Pattern’s essence**, whose **spiritual response** extends to the **Nine Heavens**!\n\n**Note:** The **Pattern’s essence** grows swiftly beneath the **maple tree**, not towering above people—this is the **Ling** [灵]. It can **emerge at night**, ascending to **leap upon the tree**, surpassing the **mother tree** in height. Those who have **tested it** often find **cotton** [绵] on the tree’s branches—**this confirms its nocturnal ascent**, surpassing the **mother tree’s stature**, and thus its **Ling** nature.\n\nThis **tree’s essence** is the **true qi of the Wood Star**—**taking it harms others**. **Never recklessly cut or damage it**, for this is **murderous**.\n\n**Take it** with the **Dao/Way’s qi** and **prohibitionary techniques**—\n**Note:** The **technique** is applied to the **left hand’s fourth finger**, at the **second joint**, binding it with **five-colored silk**.\n\n—then **inscribe the Pattern’s talisman** and **wear it as a belt**. **Swallow the talisman**, and **cut the tree accordingly**. **Affix the talisman** with **summons**.\n\n**Note:** The **summons** are **conjured with the Earthly Deities** together—this is called **taking Yang from Yin**. The **Yin field is felled**, **connecting Heaven and Earth**, stirring **divine immortals**, capturing **spirits, dragons, and ghosts**, and **expanding the human realm**. It enables one to **move mountains, block seas, uproot trees**, and **enter armies, waters, or fires**—none shall harm them.\n\nThis is the **power of human wisdom and insight**—**embracing Heaven and Earth’s Yin and Yang**, one naturally **communicates with spirits**, known as **wondrous application**.\n\nWhen the **Pattern’s essence** is **controlled and refined**, it must be done on **auspicious days**. The **master** must be **upright and pure**, with the **upper section narrow as Heaven** and the **lower section broad as Earth**, adjusting proportions to match **cosmic harmony**. The **large Pattern** must not exceed **four inches**, nor the **small Pattern** fall below **two inches**. The **length and breadth** must align **equally** in all **four cardinal directions**.\n\nWithin it lies the **Heavenly Pillar** [天柱], named **Flowing Pearl’s Complement** [配流珠], arranged in sequence—\n**Note:** The **Flowing Pearl** contains the **General of the Heavenly Pillar** [柱天将军], also **conjured and named** in this manner.\n\nThe **sage’s intent** in crafting the **Pattern’s form** was to **harmonize with Heaven and Earth**, **directing Yin and Yang**—all through **wisdom**. Wisdom **encompasses all things as Patterns**, and **nature aligns with this unity**.\n\nThus, **all undertakings** shall succeed if **applied rightly**—but **if misused**, none shall prosper, and it shall **bring harm**. You can **craft and refine** the **Pattern**, obtaining a **twelve-faced Pattern**, whose **power aligns with the Dao** and **walks the Path of Rectification** [正一], the **True Teaching’s prohibitionary techniques**, serving as the **Dao’s martial aspect**.\n\nThe **Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl** constitute the **Dao’s literary aspect**, the **True Teaching’s prohibitionary techniques**. When **both aspects are complete**, Heaven and Earth **rest within your grasp**, and Yin and Yang **lie within your heart and speech**—\n**Note:** One **scroll** states *\"within the hands.\"*\n\n—**standing, one may seize the Dao**. **This requires a loyal heart and upright nature**—\n**Note:** Loyalty is **filial devotion to the Master**, uprightness is **compassion for others**, without **deceit or crookedness**.\n\n—**virtue** shall **benefit all beings**, rooted in **compassion**. **First aid the region and state**, then **secure your own household**. If you **practice with sincerity**—\n**Note:** The **technique** is the **Flowing Pearl’s method**, which includes **conjuring garments, footwear, and talismans** [衣履斗蹑纪].\n\n—**employing the Pattern**, its **effects shall be vast**. You may **lift your household and ascend**, becoming **the teacher of Heavenly beings**.\n\n**Note:** Later, it was indeed as the **Celestial Master** [太上] spoke. Today, those who **practice and employ** it do not follow **Yu’s fixed scriptures**. They **invoke the Yellow Emperor’s words**, all **matters of ancient and modern application**.\n\nIn **current use**, it is **not as effective** as **Yu’s composed scriptures**, which **verify spiritual response** and **align with the Wood Star’s qi**. **Always select auspicious days** between **the start of Spring** and **before the Spring Equinox**, performing **two sacrificial rites** [醮] each year to the **Pattern’s spirit**. After the **rites conclude**, **seal it away** if no further use is needed.\n\n**Note:** The *Liu-Ren* [六壬] originally lacked the **sealing of the Pattern’s text**. The **Pattern’s upper and lower sections** must **face Heaven and Earth**—**never let them lose alignment**. The **Pattern’s upper section** must also **face the Celestial Master of Earth**, and the **Thunder Pattern** must **include the Food Spirit** [食神], which is the **Ghost Gate** [鬼门].\n\nThe **Liu-Ren** and **Taiyi** [太一] must all **face Heaven and Earth**—**never let them lose alignment**, or it shall **harm others**. **Never let the alignment** [纲] **include one’s own natal life-force** [本命].\n\nThe **Four-Season Patterns** must be **aligned seasonally**: **Spring** with **Summer**, **Summer** with **Autumn**, and so forth. **Winter** aligned with **Spring** shall **face Summer**, and **Summer** shall **face Autumn**—this is their **application**.\n\nThe **rites and sacrificial procedures** are **detailed in the Yellow Emperor’s Gathering of Spirits** above. **Always bind it with five-colored silk**, ensuring **no shifting or alteration**, and **inscribe the master’s life-force and year of application**—\n**Note:** The **year of application** is recorded in the **Yuan-Chen Diagram and Ritual Procedures**.\n\n—**calculating the *Jia-Zi* cycle** [甲子] as the **great year of application**, the **three celestial cycles** [三元] as the **small year of application**, and the **eight trigrams** [八卦] as the **wandering year of application**. The **three cycles** govern the **three celestial applications**—the rest are **not true calculations**, lacking **verifiable basis**.\n\n「Moreover, the **Jia-Zi cycle** [甲子] as **application year** is the composition of the **Ancestral Sage, Elder Lord of the Void** [前聖老君虚皇], serving as the **inner talismans for the Six Jia** [六甲內符行年]. The **Later Sage, Jade Emperor** [後聖了玉皇] and **Lord of the Dao** [上道君] bestowed the title **Master of the Heavenly Arts** [天師], calling it the **Six Jia Talismans’ Application Year** [六甲箓行年].\n\nWhen calculating, one must take the **location of the Five Ghosts of Yuan-Chen** [元辰五鬼] and their **overlapping configurations** [相重], then **invoke the Yuan-Chen talismans** [上元辰章解] to **pass through this calamity** [過度此厄]. Such a person **should always be treated as a royal relative** [長宜王相]—then **no worries or calamities** [無憂厄] shall befall them. If **sudden disasters or calamities** [忽有災厄] befall them, and their **body escapes but their essence does not** [身出厄不出], then according to the **Sages** [聖人], this is **not the true Application Year** [別說行年], and **not the Great Application Year** [非大行年] either. Thus, there shall be **some loss** [則有所損].\n\n**Those who study talismans** [夫人學轉式] should **always consider others’ fortunes** [常謀他人], not calculating their own. If one **recklessly applies talismans near the Four Gateway Gods** [近於四門之神],—**Heaven’s Gate** [天門], **Human’s Gate** [人門], **Earth’s Portal** [地戶], and **Ghost’s Portal** [鬼戶]—**they shall never bind such talismans to the Four Gateway Years** [切不得纲加四門].\n\nIf the **Application Year falls within the Four Minor Years** [四孟], such as **Yin** [寅], **Shen** [申], **Wei** [巳], and **Hai** [亥], then **one must not bind talismans to these Four Minor Years** [纲即不加四孟行年]. If it falls within the **Four Central Years** [四仲], such as **Zi** [子], **Wu** [午], **Mao** [卯], and **You** [酉], then **one must not bind talismans to these Four Central Years** [纲不加四仲行年]. If it falls within the **Four Seasonal Years** [四季], such as **Chen** [辰], **Xu** [戌], **Chou** [丑], and **Wei** [未], then **one must not bind talismans to these Four Seasonal Years** [纲不加四季行年].\n\n**Note:** If there are **urgent matters** [有急事], then **twist the Talisman Supervisor’s Incantation** [捻都監誥], **digging the time** [堑時] on the **10th or 5th day** [十日五曰]. If there are **no pressing affairs** [事無], then **quickly resolve it** [即急解之], and **success shall follow** [即得]. If there are **sudden and dire emergencies** [更有急卒], and **one has not yet obtained resolution** [未得解者], then take the **Heavenly Talisman’s position of the Application Year** [天式上行年神位], place a **single layer of the Long-Life Talisman** [長生符] upon it, and **subdue and suppress** [鎮克] the calamity. Thus, **one shall forever not fear being harmed by others** [永不畏加臨人害].\n\nThe **Long-Life Talisman** [長生符] is **woven with inner talismans** [卷內符] and **inscribed in vermilion** [朱書], with **this single layer** [此符一道] placed **upon the Heavenly Talisman’s original life-force and Application Year position** [安天式上本命行年神位]. It **subdues and repels calamities** [鎮卻災厄]. If **worn on the left arm behind the elbow** [一道帶之於左肘之後], it **shall not protect other talismans** [用加諸式不畏], but rather **harm one’s own body** [反損己身].\n\nThe **Five Agents** [五行] begin with **Worldly Water** [世水], which is the **Chen Star’s scattered *qi*** [辰星散炁]. Water can **transform into refined *qi*** [精炁] and **become a Dragon** [從龍], and the Dragon **borrows the Chen Star’s yin *qi*** [假辰星陰炁] to **generate feathers** [而生羽]. Feathers are the **Chen Star’s yang *qi* dispersing** [羽是辰星之陽炁散], **congealing into yin** [凝陰], and **returning to water** [而為水]. **The yang *qi* of water** [水陽炁] is what **produces feathers** [所生羽], and **feathers represent humanity** [羽是人].\n\nThe surname **Feather** [羽姓] is taken from this, and **one who bears this surname** [既有其人] should **marry with descendants of the Shang surname** [而取商姓之子], producing **five sons** [生五子]. The **eldest son** [長子] shall take the **original surname of Water** [初姓水], the **second son** [二子] shall bear the surname **Feather** [羽姓], the **third and fourth sons** [三子、四子] shall **collectively be surnamed Feather** [總成羽姓], and the **fifth son** [五子] shall bear the surname **Red** [赤], which is the **modern Red Clan** [今之赤氏]. Many have **altered their surnames** [亦多改姓], such as the **Jufu Wu Clan** [朱浮吳氏].\n\nAdditionally, the **third and second sons’ branches** [三子、二子支中] often **change or alter surnames** [後代多改易姓], such as the **Pan, Luo, Gan, Wang, and Shi surnames** [潘、羅、甘、王、石之姓].\n\nNow, **those who gather these talismans** [今據合是羽姓之人] should **refine Mercury** [合煉水銀]. Mercury **belongs to Water** [水銀屬水], while **Metal belongs to Shang** [金屬商], and **Metal and Water are harmoniously combined** [金水合宜]. These two substances **form a medicine** [為藥], and **taking it shall benefit longevity** [服而有益壽之理].\n\nThe **Floating Mound Master’s Inner Teachings** [《浮丘公內傳》] states: **\"The Northern realm’s Water surname Feather** [北方水姓羽] has the nature of **nourishing and prolonging all things** [羽性潤長萬物]. It can also **extinguish all things** [亦能滅萬物], adapting to the **Four Seasons** [以隨四季], and **executing the command to generate or perish** [而行令生滅]. All these are **utilized by humanity** [皆用人弘之], to **nourish and benefit** [令潤益亦得], or to **follow its nature and harm figures and things** [令從性損人物亦得]. It **has no inherent moral principle** [本無正心], but **its *qi* is upright** [而有正炁]. **The intentions of mortals lie in warmth and cold** [志人行溫冷在人], which **depend on humanity** [岂在乎水].\n\n**Floating Mound Master** [浮丘先生] **often ate Water Kei** [常以采水芝而食], thereby **living to over two hundred years** [生長二百 ‘乎年]. When he **encountered the Most High Ancestral Sage, Elder Lord** [遇太上前聖老君], the **Elder Lord taught him the method of recording the Middle Dipper’s position** [教中斗地紀之法]. After **four years** [四年], his **body grew light like a Dragon’s** [驾龍體輕], and **he could fly by himself** [自能飛身]. In the **fifth year** [五年], the **Chen Star Lord** [辰星君] descended to **test his talents** [下觀試才], finding **nine faults** [有九過], and **bestowed upon him a secondary Dragon** [便以別驾一龍與公]. The Master **feared falling from its back and dying** [公畏落身死], so he **prostrated himself twice more** [再拜求], **begging for his body to grow feathers** [乞自身生毛羽], so that **he could ride the Dragon without falling** [即乘龍無或堕落], and **his body would become fine dust** [身粉為微塵], **unable to be immediately removed** [不可即去].\n\nThe **Chen Star Lord, the Most True One** [辰星太真君], then asked: **\"You are surnamed Floating Mound** [卿姓浮丘], but **your original surname is Feather** [本姓羽]. I shall **grant you the method of transforming the Middle Dipper’s position into the clothing of Yu, the Great Dipper’s configuration** [與卿變履斗為禹配衣之法], and **when practiced for five years** [行之五年], your **body shall naturally grow feathers** [體自生毛羽], allowing you to **soar through the Celestial Abyss** [飛遊洞天]. **Such a Daoist official** [此之仙官] is **most noble and grand** [至貴至大], **why must you necessarily ascend to Heaven** [何必要升天]? Even if you **ascend to Heaven**, you shall **arrive at the Celestial Bureau** [到天曹], **where the Lord of the Court is summoned** [引朝太平君], **and later return to the Celestial Abyss** [後即還配於洞天].\n\n**\"If you are capable** [子若能], then **you may also teach it** [即可便教]. The Master **prostrated himself twice more in request** [公再拜請受], **begging to receive the instruction.**」\n\nThe Lord said: *\"I have not heard that there is the Step of the Great Yu, the one who tamed the floods. When he regulated the waters, the Most High descended and personally observed him as he took three steps with nine strides.*\n\nThe Most High, Laozi, instructed Yu: *'Do you not see the spirit of the Douyi bird, which takes flight? Even birds follow the principle of three steps and nine strides, turning stones and wood to seize serpents. A note: If birds, which have such intent, can do this, how much more so can humans?'*\n\nYu received the teaching and sought the method, and thus mastered the **Five Dipper Transformation** [翻五斗], ascending to the **Supreme Polarity** [太极], assuming a **water-essence corpse** [水精为尸], and being buried in the **Southern Yue** [南越].\n\nUpon this, the Master awoke and learned it. After five years, his body truly grew feathers and hair. In one year, he could fly ten *li*, five *li*—people at the time called this feathered man who could fly the **Guest of the Plumed Body** [毛羽之客]. Thus, he earned his name.\n\nLater, after seven years, he could fly a thousand *li*, entering the **Celestial Abyss** [洞天], coming and going between the mortal realm for hundreds of years. Suddenly, one day, he rode a dragon and departed, never returning.\n\nHis five descendants each changed their surnames, though even after changing them, they could not depart from the North. Thus, they became the **Five Qi** [五炁].\n*A note: All regions follow the Five Surnames, corresponding to metal, water, wood, fire, and earth as qi. Each color governs a direction; hence, people today are called \"born on a certain *yin* day, the son of green,\" and so on.*\n\nThe virtue of accumulated water and the spread of Yu’s achievements—this is the transformation of the **Minister of the Hour Star** [辰星]. Though slightly fearful of earth, earth, though subduing water, cannot utterly extinguish it when water is abundant.\n\nThe use of the Five Surnames lies in water’s ability to both nourish and harm things. It leans toward supporting wood while embracing metal’s mutual generation and assistance.\n\nPractitioners of the Dao, when walking upon the **Water Star** [水星], must also manipulate the **Wood Key** [木诀] and the **Metal Key** [金诀], aligning with water. Water will then nourish the **True Qi** [真炁] and sustain it within the body.\n\nLater, the **Saintly Sovereign** [后圣君] told the **Great King** [大王君]:\n*\"Your disciple, Master Mao Ying and Master Mao Gu, are water-destined individuals. When practicing the Step, first manipulate the **Wood Star Key** [木星诀]. Then, with the fingers of your next hand, point to the Wood Star, supporting the body and solidifying the spirit. Only then can one attain the **Lower True** [下真] and become the **Earthly Master of the Celestial Rank** [地上主仙位]. For though aged and spiritually exhausted, they can no longer ascend and fly. Only after a hundred or a thousand years, if they do not encounter a great Daoist, can they await the **Upper True** [上真].\"*\n\nThe Most High, Laozi, told **Yuanji Zi** [元极子]:\n*A note: This is Mr. Wuji, a Qin native, surnamed Zheng, named Jichu.*\n*\"You too follow the principle of the Five Surnames, leaning toward the Water Surname. You have merit, and you revere water well—thus, the water dragon appeared and bestowed a book upon you. Those who revere the Water Surname and honor water deeply are often those of the Water Surname, who habitually walk the Dipper and manipulate the Water Star Key, their hearts ever respectful.*\n\nIf one practices the Dao, and again manipulates the **Earth Key** [土诀] for five years, the gods of the rivers and seas will appear before them, teaching you the method of **taming dragons**, making rain and clear skies respond to your will as if by hand, accomplished in an instant. Is this not the result of preserving the merit of water in practice, thus enabling you to **race dragons and command rain**, swift as thought?\n\nWuji followed this teaching, and indeed, as foretold, he later rode a dragon and ascended to the **Mysterious Isle** [玄洲].\"*\n\nIn the time of **Emperor Yao and Shun**, there was **Mountain-Dwelling Child Xu Xun**, a water-destined individual. He often revered water, creating a pond, and always instructed his household to treat it with utmost respect. He also habitually drank a *he* of water daily.\n\nAfter six years, suddenly, a mirror appeared at the pond’s center, six *cun* wide, round and beautiful like the moon. Xu Xun carried it, and sixteen mirror spirits followed him. There were also fourteen jade maidens, fourteen jade boys, and one general.\n\nXu Xun asked, and they replied: *\"We are great gods. The Great Minister of the Hour Star returned the **Northern Sky Water Mother’s Mirror** [北霄水母之镜] to us, fearing you might lose it and suffer harm. We tested you. If you truly revered water, believed in the Five Phases, habitually walked the stars and Dipper, and used the method without deceit, then if you passed the test, we would grant you the **Celestial True Rank** [天真之位]. Later, though you failed, you ascended to the **Supreme Polarity** [太极] and did not attain the **Upper Pure** [上清].\"*\n\nThe **Saintly Sovereign** then instructed **Mao Xi** [茅喜]:\n*A note: Xi was the great-grandfather of Ying, serving as the teacher of Le Ba.*\n*\"At the end of the Qin Dynasty, he attained immortality and could transform water into rain. The method of transforming water into rain:*\n\nOn **homologous *bingzi* days** [丙子日] and **homologous *jiazi* days** [甲子日], take a basin of water, holding it in your left hand, and walk the **Earthly Circuit** [地纪] three times.\n*A note: If skilled, simply walk while mentally visualizing the shape of the Northern Dipper’s Earthly Circuit—do not form the Central Dipper shape. The Central Dipper belongs to earth, causing rain to fail. Always form the Northern Dipper shape. If your visualization and intent are profound and effective, even without walking the circuit, it will work. Merely walk while focusing your mind—it will surely take effect.*\n\nAfter three circuits, perform the **Yu Step** [禹步] three times, then spread to the **Three Wilds** [三野] six times, and to the **Six Wilds** [六野] nine times. The **Nine Wilds** [九野] will fill the sky with rain. Obtain the nine circuits.\n\nAfter completing the steps, manipulate the **Rain-Invoking Key** [行雨诀], holding nine mouthfuls of water, and spit them toward the sky. In an instant, the heavens and earth darken, and rain falls.\n\nThis method is divine and verifiable—do not use it recklessly. If there is no drought, do not employ it. For drought is a prohibition by the **Celestial Emperor** [天帝], and using it invites the crime of **rebelling against Heaven** [反天之罪]. The **Saintly Sovereign’s decree** will surely demote you in the **Daoist ranks** [仙品]. This method was granted only to those of sincere intent.\n\nIf there is a fire disaster, you may use it to save people’s homes and those in peril from fire. Spread open, perform the **Yu Step** three times, expand to the **Three Wilds** six times, and to the **Six Wilds** nine times. Walking the circuit will cause rain to fall across the **Nine Heavens**, even a thousand *li* away.\n\nThe **Four Directions’ Dragon Gods** will race through the clouds, bringing rain to save a certain household or family from fire disaster.\"\n*A note: This refers to Emperor Wu’s subject Le Ba, who, after serving wine to the emperor, bowed and, facing southwest, spat and summoned rain to save his own home and relatives from fire.*\n\n「When the **Saintly Sovereign** [后帝] first perceives the **Way’s** [道] **spiritual protection** [仙品], its efficacy is undeniable—it must be a **Daoist adept** [神仙] who guards the **Way** [道]. Such a one should be revered in the annals of history.\n\nThe incantation reads:\n*\"The essence of the **Morning Star** [辰星], condensed into watery form.*\n*When flames erupt suddenly, invoke the **water’s spirit** [水之灵].*\n*Dissipate its shape and unleash its spirit—rain will fill the heavens.*\n*The spirit ascends into the **Dark and Mysterious** [冥晦], and the **Dragon** [龙] exhales it to act.*\n\n*Fivefold torrents [霶霪] in all seasons shall quench that calamity.*\n*Swiftly, as the **Law of the Dao** [律令] decrees.\"*\n\n*A note: Master Wang [王真人] stated: \"This method must not be recklessly practiced. It should only be employed to save one’s family or aid others.\"*\n\n---\n\n**The Four Seas and Five Phases [五行] Incantation** [六纪]\nBeneath the **Five Phases** [五行], the **Six Divisions** [六纪] arise.\n\nThe **Venerable Lord Lao** [老君] instructed **Great Yu** [大禹]:\n*\"You govern the waters—on the days of **Jiazi** [甲子], write the names of the **Four Seas’ Gods** [四海之神名] in vermilion on thin paper.\"*\n\n*A note: The names of the Four Seas’ Gods are as follows:\nThe **East Sea God** [东海神] is **Preli Ni** [颇利尼],\nthe **South Sea God** [南海神] is **Dazhe Jia** [大遮迦],\nthe **West Sea God** [西海神] is **Huo Luo Wen** [和罗问],\nand the **North Sea God** [北海神] is **Wen Ji Jian** [文季间].\nThese names were newly inscribed by the winds [各风新注], not previously recorded.*\n\nAfter dawn rituals and practice, swallow the paper. When three years’ merit is fulfilled, the waters will obey as if by earth’s command—unblocking rivers and opening seas. The **Sea Gods** [海之神水官], the **Four Seas’ Great Gods** [四海大神], will appear at your summons.\n\nTo command them to unblock rivers and open seas, recite the **Four Seas’ Incantation** [四海诀], and their **Three Steps and Nine Marks** [三步九迹] will manifest. Call their names, and they will arrive instantly—dispatch them swiftly. Their dominion extends beyond the Four Seas, encompassing both land and sea.\n\nIf you request rain, it will come in moments.\n\nAfter five years, follow the same method to invoke the **Ghost King Incantation** [鬼王诀].*\n*A note: The incantation is inscribed on the second joint of the left hand’s second finger [左手第二指第二节中].*\n\n*The **Great Ghost Marshal** [大鬼帅] of the North, **Pishamen** [毗沙门神], will appear. Command him to aid the nation in its affairs.\"*\n\nThis is used when subduing rebellions in certain lands or against bandits, or against the **Tibetan and Western barbarians** [吐蕃西戎]. All such cases employ this method.\n\nAdditionally, one may inscribe the **Ghost King Incantation** [鬼王诀] with vermilion or black ink, empowering it to traverse **Heaven and Earth**, enter **fire, water, or armies**—all as desired. The **Ghost Kings** of the **Four Directions** [四方] are governed by this **Incantation’s Master** [管主], who submits to the **Morning Star’s Sovereign Lord** [辰星太皇君].\n\nPractitioners need only walk the **Five Stars** [五星].*\n*A note: The **true Five Stars Diagram** [真五星图] is found in the *Scripture of the Flying Step* [《飞步经》]. Use the Five Stars Diagram for practice.*\n\n*The **Five Phases** [五行].*\n*A note: This refers to transforming the **Five Stars Diagram** [五星图] into the **Five Phases** [五行], following the sequence: **Metal** [金], **Water** [水], **Wood** [木], **Fire** [火], **Earth** [土].*\n\nBegin with **Metal** [金], moving leftward. Upon completion, you reach **Water** [水].*\n*A note: From **Metal** [金], enter **Fire** [火], then **Earth** [土], then **Wood** [木], and finally **Water** [水].*\n\nFor the **Five Phases** [五行], begin with **Wood** [木], moving rightward. Upon completion, you reach **Water** [水] again.*\n*A note: From **Wood** [木], enter **Fire** [火], then **Metal** [金], then **Earth** [土], and finally **Water** [水].*\n\nEach step must be **tread upon** [蹑],*\n*A note: Tread upon the **Five Stars** [五星], then walk the **Five Phases** [五行].*\n\nfour times. Upon finishing, step outside the diagram’s bounds and perform the **Yu Step** [禹步] four more times.\n\nThus, the **Four Gate Gods** [四门神] will aid the nation in its campaigns.\n\nWhen armies march across **rivers, lakes, mountains, and valleys**, all trees will bloom with **thunderous winds and rain**, and obstacles will be removed, transformed, or altered.*\n*A note: **Transformation** [变改] refers to rivers and lakes being blocked or cleared, mountains and valleys being opened like rivers and streams, and trees being uprooted or snapped.*\n\nThis method can also grant one the **essentials of longevity and eternal life** [长生久视].\n\nWhen flames first ignite, the **worldly fire** [世火] is the **Mangon Star** [荧惑星], dispersing **vital essence** [炁], a **portent** [征].\n\n**Portent** [征] is the **Celestial Sovereign** [天皇], surnamed **Zheng** [姓征].\nThe remaining **vital essence** [炁] becomes **copper-red stone** [铜赤石].\n\nThe **Celestial Sovereign** [天皇] strikes the stone to ignite fire, while **Suiren** [燧人] drills wood to kindle it—thus fire is born.\n\nFire originates from the **Celestial Sovereign** [天皇] and **Suiren** [燧人], and from this point, **fire and water** [火水] transform **raw into cooked** [生为熟], fulfilling fire’s function—another **portent** [征].*\n*A note: **Portent** [征] here refers to humanity [人]. It is the child of the **Mangon Star** [荧惑星], bearing the surname **Zheng** [姓征].*\n\nThis **Celestial Sovereign** [天皇] intermarried with the **Earthly Sovereign’s descendants** [宫姓之土子], producing three sons.\n\nThe eldest son changed his surname to **Li** [理], and later, the **Saintly Sovereign of the Later Han** [后圣李君] adopted the surname **Li** [李].\nThe second son bore the surname **Ji** [纪], branching into the surnames **Dai** [戴] and **Zheng** [郑], among others, totaling **thirty-nine surnames** [三十九姓].\nAmong the **Five Correct Surnames** [正五姓], only those of **Fire** [火] and **Metal** [金] lineages are suitable for refining **elixirs** [丹药].\n\nWhen their **virtue/power** [德] is cultivated, they will surely achieve **longevity** [延驻].\nWith **longevity**, the **Great Elixir** [大丹药] will be perfected.\n\nThe **Venerable Lord Lao’s** [太上老君] **Inner Transmission Master** [内传], **Guangchengzi** [广成子], was surnamed **Li** [理].\nThe scripture states: *\"Guangchengzi is the **Venerable Lord Lao’s** [老君] incarnate form. If one follows the surname **Li** [理], it is one body, continuously manifesting as rulers or ministers in each generation.\"*\n\nTo refine the **Golden Elixir** [金丹], one may take **golden liquid** [金液] and undergo **ninefold refining** [九炼].\nAlternatively, refine **golden stone** [金石], **mercury** [水银], **lead** [铅], **cinnabar** [朱砂], or **malachite** [曾青], among others, into the **Great Dragon-Tiger Elixir** [龙虎大丹], which will be completed in nine years.\n\nWhen the emperor consumes it, his **vital essence** [气] will gradually stabilize, his strength will grow, and he will tirelessly march a hundred *li* daily.\n\nLater, he will **follow the Celestial Pattern and Earthly Divisions** [履蹑天纲地纪], forming the **heart seal** [心印] beneath the nail of the left thumb [左手大指甲下], and storing it with the right hand [右手就之存之].\n\nAll such practices should be conducted on the **third, thirteenth, and twenty-third days of the eighth month** [八月三日、十三日、二十三日], seated as per the diagram.\n\nAlternatively, one may stand while holding the **diagram of the Encompassing Whole** [含弘图].\nThe diagram should be hung with both hands lowered—this is **concealment** [隐].\nSimply retain it in mind as the **Encompassing Whole** [含弘], whether standing or seated, as one’s intention dictates.\n\nThe **Venerable Lord Lao** [太上老君], the **Empty Celestial Sovereign** [虚皇上帝], instructed **Yuanming Shangzhenren** [元明上真人] to teach the **heart seal’s seated and standing methods** [结心印坐立总行].\n\nThe **Yellow Emperor** [黄帝] originally drew the **Encompassing Whole** [弘一] for seated and standing practice, but later generations need only cultivate **one diagram** [一图].\n\nThe three sons each had three descendants, hence the **ninefold lineage** [三三九人].\n\nThey married within the **Jue Palace** [角宫], and their descendants flourished. Among them arose those of the **Five Phases** [五行], and at their deaths, they all ascended to the heavens **riding clouds and dragons** [乘云驾龙].\n\nThe **lineage perpetually transmits the Dao’s teachings**, with the **Cloud-Fire clan** [云火姓]—\n*Note: \"Clan\" here denotes lineage affiliation; Cloud-Fire is the lineage of Fire.*\n\n—**aligned with Fire’s mandate** [与火命].\n*Note: Human life is inherently linked to Fire, hence also aligned with Fire’s mandate.*\n\nThey **greatly fear Water** [甚畏水].\n*Note: Why does Fire fear Water? Because Water extinguishes Fire.*\n\nAll other clans are said to **mutually subdue** [相克], but Water and Fire **mutually extinguish** [相灭], hence their profound fear.\n\nThey **preserve the *Jiji* Diagram** [存蹑纪图] on the **four seasonal days** [四季日]—\n**Chen, Xū, Chǒu, Wèi** [辰戌丑未]—\n\nin accordance with **inversion, reversal, and the three transformations** [顺倒反三等].\n\nUpon completion, they **walk three circuits** [散步三匝].\n\nThen, they **stand before the *Diji* Seven Stars Diagram** [存地纪七星图处前], adopt the **Yǔ Step** [变作禹步], and **point to the Water Star** [指水星]—\n*Note: The stars are preserved as well; just as the Five Stars Diagram represents five stars, this is the same.*\n\n—**twisting the Water Talisman** [捻水诀].\n\nUpon completion, they **point to the Earth Star** [次指土星] and **twist the Earth Talisman** [捻土诀].\n\nThen, they **recite the incantation**:\n\n*\"The Five Phases mutually propel,\nMetal and Wood mutually subdue,\nWater and Fire mutually extinguish,\nAnd so forth.\"*\n\n*Note: This incantation is found in the *Liúzhū* [《流珠》].*\n\nIf one performs this **three times within a month** [三度为之],\nand since a month has **three decans** [三旬], each decan contains the **four seasonal days** [四季],\nthen practicing it daily throughout the year **ensures a life free from calamity, misfortune, or illness** [一生无灾厄疾患].\n\nThe *Liúzhū* and *Fēibù Tiāngāi Jīng* [《飞步天纲经》] state:\n*\"A year free from calamity—this is precisely it.\"*\n\n**In truth, those who adhere to this talisman shall never fail to attain immortality** [实但依此言，无有不得仙之者].\nIf one follows the *Shǒuwén Jīng*’s teachings [手文经说修行] instead, **not one in ten thousand shall succeed** [万无一成].\n\nThus, this talisman is **recorded for those whose will and resolve are upright and sincere** [志修志信直心之人].\nIt is to be **passed down only to such individuals** [可一一传付].\n\nThe talisman is **transmitted orally** [诀以口传], with each generation **faithfully receiving and reciting it** [继代相付勑祝].\n\n**Only the worthy may pass it on**; for the unworthy, **not even a billion ounces of gold and jade could justify transmission** [非人者万亿金玉不传].\n\nIf no worthy disciple arises to transmit it, it is **sealed on the Sacred Mountain** [封於灵山].\nIf even that fails, **burn the talisman and let the water flow to the Heavenly Treasure** [火烧水流天宝].\n\n**After two years**, one is **free from military strife** [辟兵].\n*Note: Practicing for two years allows the Five Phases to manifest, thus warding off the Five Armies of calamity.*\n\nThe **Sage Emperor** [后圣君] told the **Celestial Master** [天师]:\n*\"You may become an Immortal King.\nWhen the Five Phases converge, you shall be able to **strengthen one through all five** [强一].\nThe **Upper Elemental Lord** [上元主天], who governs the **Heavenly Step Talisman** [飞步天纲],\nthe **Middle Elemental Lord** [中元主人], who governs the **Yǔ Step** [演禹步],\nand the **Lower Elemental Lord** [下元主水地], who governs **Treading the Earth** [蹑地],\n\nare all **aligned with the Northern Dipper** [北斗星], hence the name **Earth-Water** [地水].\nTogether, they **subdue the Water Regions** [俱镇水乡].\n\n**For those who cultivate immortality with sincere resolve** [志心学仙],\nto **abandon the immortality-treading talisman** [去仙履地水] is to **practice the Lower Elemental method** [即今蹑地纪图顺倒反],\n\nwhich is the **Yǔ Step** [即为禹步], **three steps and nine traces** [三步九迹], known as the **Middle Water Elemental** [谓中水元].\n\nTo **master the Heavenly Step Talisman** [履天纲] and **fly with nine traces** [飞行九迹] is called the **Upper Elemental** [谓之上元].\n\nThis doctrine of the **three methods** [此说三者] is to **record the Three Souls** [以录三魂] and **restrain the Three Officials** [制止三官].\nThe Five refers to the **Five Phases** [五行], as explained above.\n\n**After three years**, one attains **divine communication** [通神] and the **path of non-death** [不死之道], whether standing or seated.\n\n**After nine years**, one may **enter Water, enter Fire, enter Stone, enter Wood, enter the Sun and Moon without obstruction** [入水入火，入石入木，入日月，无碍也].\n\nThe **Venerable Lord Lao** [太上老君] bestowed the **Fire Phase Talisman** [火行符], which the **Three Celestial Mandate Lords** [三天司命君] wear to **ward off Water’s harm to life** [辟水害命水官].\nIt is **worn on the head** [戴安头上],\n*Note: Some say it should be worn long-term; others say it should be inscribed on the day of one’s birth or the Water Day, ensuring lasting protection from calamities.*\n\n—**to dispel Water’s harm to *qi*** [去水害炁].\n\nThe **Fire Phase Talisman** [火行符]—\n*Note: The first talisman of the Fire Phase, carried by Fire-Mandate individuals to ward off Water calamities.*\n\n—**the Sage Emperor** [后圣君] said:\n*\"The talismans of the earlier sages to subdue the Water Mandate Officials were all in written form* [告命水官符，皆是文字].\nI now **explain the Fire Phase Talisman** [解火行一符],\n*Note: Some say \"now reveal.\"*\nand the **four subsequent talismans follow the same principle** [后四符同].\nThe **Venerable Lord Lao’s talisman** [太上符] is used to **steam the Earth and block Water’s calamities** [火行蒸土，塞水害灾是也].\"\n\nThe **Wood Phase Talisman** [木行符]—\n*Note: The second Fire Phase talisman, worn by Wood-Mandate individuals to ward off Metal’s harm to *qi*.*\n\nThe **Metal Phase Talisman** [金行符]—\n*Note: The third Fire Phase talisman, worn by Metal-Mandate individuals to ward off Fire’s harm to *qi*.*\n\nThe **Water Phase Talisman** [水行符]—\n*Note: The fourth Fire Phase talisman, worn by Water-Mandate individuals to ward off Earth’s harm to *qi*.*\n\nThe **Earth Phase Talisman** [土行符]—\n*Note: The fifth Fire Phase talisman, worn by Earth-Mandate individuals to ward off Wood’s harm to *qi*.*\n\nThe **Venerable Lord Lao instructed the Mandate Lord Hàn** [老君告司命韩君]—\n*Note: Named \"Xìn Xiàngshàng,\" Hàn Xìn was the Mandate Lord during the Yellow Emperor’s era, not the Han Dynasty’s Hàn Xìn.*\n\n—**Hàn Xìn of old**, who was **faithful to the Celestial** [上古信上], and served as the **Three Celestial Mandate Lords** [三天司命].\nIn the **Han Dynasty**, he was the **Mandate Lord overseeing the regions of Qi, Chu, Yan, and Qin** [信汉将].\n*Note: After the death of later heroes, Hàn Xìn became the Mandate Lord for the Han general.*\n\n*\"Within the Five Phases**, two phases favor life and completion** [二行好人生成].\nThe **Eastern Nine *Qi*** [东方九炁] **govern life’s flourishing** [主好生].\nThe **Southern Three *Qi*** [南方三炁] **govern completion’s success** [主好成].\n\nNow, the **Great Dao’s teachings** [大道之教] **emphasize life and completion** [以重生成].\nThe **teachings of the Netherworld** [阴鬼之教] **prioritize repose and decay** [以重休废].\n*Note: The Netherworld is also called the Earth Teachings.*\n\n**Repose and decay belong to Yin** [休废属阴].\n*Note: Yin is anciently termed the Earth Teachings.*\n\nIn the **recent Zhou Dynasty**, the **Western lands produced the Hu deities** [西国出胡神], with the surname **Shì** [姓释], titled **Fó** [号佛], and called the **World-Honored One** [称世尊].\nThey **prospered the Yin teachings**, instructing people in **dragon ghosts** [教人龙鬼].\nChinese **scholars named this the Yin Teachings** [中国名儒以号阴教].\n\nThose who **master the teachings of dragon ghosts** [通人龙鬼之教] **are skilled at encouraging virtuous conduct and sincere resolve** [甚能劝善行心],\nand their talismans **share the same efficacy as the Dao’s** [诀与道同].\nYet, they **do not advocate early transcendence and early birth** [不合令劝人早化早生],\nfor such views **prioritize repose and decay without merit** [如此之见，以重休废不虚].\nThus, they **do not surpass the Great Dao’s emphasis on life and completion** [即不似重生成之义而为大].\n\nThe **teachings of the Yang Deities** [阳神之教] **prioritize life and completion** [以重生成], which belong to **Yang** [生成属阳].\n*Note: Yang is anciently termed the Heaven Teachings, with no distinct name.*\n\nIn the **era of the Three Sovereigns** [三皇之世], the **multitude of deities had no names** [众尊无名], and their teachings were **equal and strong** [平等之教].\nHowever, the **Yellow Emperor’s time**, the **Emperor valued the Great Strength** [帝重大强], and its name **seemed inconsistent with the Great Dao’s laws** [其名似不合大道之教律],\nso it was **renamed the Heavenly Dao** [改名曰天道].\n\nIn the **era of Yǔ’s succession** [近禹代之时], the **proper name was restored** [而取正名],\nand it became the **Supreme Great Dao** [曰太上大道也].\n\n**Yin is likened to the moon** [阴与月为喻],\n*Note: The moon symbolizes thirty days, with fifteen days representing fullness and fifteen days representing gradual waning,*\nto signify **that life’s mandate is not long-lasting** [喻命不用久长].\n\n**Yang is likened to the sun** [阳以日为言],\nto signify **long life and enduring vision** [言长生久视].\nThus, **Yin and Yang in their seasons** [阴阳二时],\n**practice Wood and Fire for life and completion** [行木火好生成].\nThis is the **first and second principle** [是一二义].\n\n**Practice Metal and Water for repose and decay** [行金水好休废].\nThis is the **first principle** [是一义].\n\n**Another principle is to follow auspicious and inauspicious patterns** [又一行顺吉凶].\n\n「**Note:** Thus, Earth follows auspiciousness, yet also follows inauspiciousness.\nHence it is said that the Sage-King follows both auspicious and inauspicious patterns—or follows inauspiciousness.\n\nMy teaching, though likened to the origin of Yin and Yang,\nreturns to the **qi of Yin and Yang**,\nabandoning the paths of auspiciousness and inauspiciousness,\ntreading the **Lunar Steps** and **Starry Paths**,\nascending to the **Celestial Immortal Gate**.\n\nLater, the **Sage-Sovereign** instructed **Yinxi the True Person**:\n*\"The **Supreme Void Emperor** transmitted the **Five-Phase Talisman** to the one of Fire.\nFire belongs to the summer’s heat,\nable to nurture and complete all things,\nand also to refine through fire, dispelling calamities and dust.\n**Note:** Gold and silver refine away the taint of dust to reveal their luster;\nfire refines away misfortune and affliction to reveal vitality—\nthus, fire’s hundred virtues are recorded, and the **Fire Phase** is inscribed.\n\nWhat was transmitted was the **Fire Phase**.\n\nThe **Supreme Dao-Sovereign** told **Laozi**:\n*\"What Phase did you command?\"*\nLaozi replied:\n*\"I commanded the Phase of Wood.\"*\nThe Dao-Sovereign said:\n*\"I commanded the Phase of Fire.\"*\nWe both have emerged from Water and Fire,\nand thus have no worries.\n**Note:** These two Most High True Ones, with their bodies transcending the Five Phases,\nhave no term of decay or ruin—hence the saying.\n\nYet the lower True Ones of the Immortal Way struggle to depart from Water and Fire.\nThough their bodies may linger, they do not exceed a thousand years.\nWater and Fire cycle endlessly, with decay and suffering ever in attendance—\nself-destruction and slaughter are inevitable unless the Dao intervenes.\nThus, the two Most High Teachers discussed Water and Fire.\n\nLater, the **Sage-Sovereign** told the **Celestial Master**:\n*\"I have heard that the two Most High True Ones of Ultimate Reality discussed Water and Fire—why?\"*\nBecause among the Five Phases,\nWater and Fire **clash destructively**,\nbringing countless illnesses, afflictions, and failures,\nand even shatter Heaven and Earth.\nHow much more so for the human body,\nwhich lacks an unbreakable form!\n\nMoreover, the **Fire Star** and the **wandering Mars**,\nsuddenly dispersing into **Yang qi**,\nbecome **Fire’s destructive poison**.\nThe great wind blows the Water,\nand the **Water’s Star of Chen** suddenly disperses into **Yin qi**,\nbecoming **thunder and rain**—\nboth move in assault, striking and conquering each other,\nthus creating **Heaven’s affliction**.\nSuffering this **howling wind and violent storm**,\nHeaven is struck by falling stars and shattered rocks,\nEarth by snapped trees and crumbling mountains,\nand humanity by ruined dwellings and lost lives.\nThis afflicts the **Three Realms**—\nhence the Most High True Ones’ intent in their discourse,\ndesiring that the lower True Ones of the Immortal Way\nreceive these words within their hearts.\nThe heart must not suffer Water and Fire’s calamities and ruin,\nnor must the body and mind fail to attain **transcendence**—\nto transcend the Five Phases’ paths,\nseeking the **Three Pure Ones’ essence**.\nThe nature of Water and Fire, when natural, is without worry,\nunaffected by Water and Fire’s disasters and misfortunes.\n\nThus, the three Most High Saints of old\nused the analogy of Water and Fire\nto admonish the lower True Ones of the Immortal Way,\nso that they might transcend Water and Fire’s calamities,\nenter the **effortless nature**,\nand naturally attain True Reality.\nTheir **Dao-bodies** become firm and pure,\ncleansing Heaven and Earth.\n\nAs for the body,\nrefer to the previous notes.»\n\n「This also brings worry to mortals.\n*(Also, refer to the previous notes.)*\nYou are the teacher of humanity and Heaven—\nthus, you may transmit the **Water and Fire talismans**,\nto guide the lower True Ones into the ranks of the Immortals,\nand help them escape the **Water and Fire afflictions**.\n\n**Note:** Those who cultivate the Way with sincere resolve,\nall lack the Water and Fire **Dao-nature**,\ndwelling in mountains and forests,\ndevoting their utmost sincerity and resolve,\nburning incense and reciting scriptures without cease.\nSome refine gold and stones, ingesting their elixirs,\nothers practice **shell-breaking** and **breath-work** (*xūqì* 服炁).\nThese ranks of practitioners,\nthrough years of earnest Dao-cultivation,\nremain trapped in Water and Fire’s afflictions,\nsuccumbing to decay, aging, and death,\nyet gain nothing—at most.\n\nThe **Most High Dao Lord** (*Tàishàng Dàojūn*) commands **Laozi**,\nwho teaches those of steadfast resolve\nto escape the Water and Fire afflictions within the body,\nand the Water and Fire calamities of the Five Phases,\nthus bestowing the **Five Star Talismans** from the *Líu Zhū* (*Flowing Pearl*) scripture,\nand issuing this book,\nalong with the **Later Saints’** talismans passed down by the **Celestial Master** (*Tiānshī*),\nthe **Three Five** (*Sānwǔ*) *Líu Zhū* scriptures,\nand the **Most High Three Five Orthodoxy Talismans** (*Tàishàng Sānwǔ Zhèngyī Fúluò*),\nthe **Eighty-One Stages**,\nto safeguard body and home,\nand avert Water and Fire disasters.\n\n**First Water Talisman.**\n**Note:** The talisman is within the *Língbǎo Wǔ Fú* (*Soul Treasures Five Talismans*).\nThe great one declares:\n*\"This is the talisman of the Northern Emperor,\nwritten in black ink,\nto be worn upon the back.\"*\nThe Five Phases’ **master talisman**,\nwhich **Laozi** bestowed upon **Yellow Emperor** (*Huángdì*),\nis the true original.\n**Yǔ**’s version from **Jīngshān** (*荆山*) and his later cultivation\nis a lesser copy—\nnot personally inscribed by **Laozi**.\nIt is somewhat similar,\nyet not as efficacious as the great original.\n\n**Second Fire Talisman.**\n**Note:** These two talismans appear together in the *Five Talismans*—\nthis one is not further detailed here.\n**Laozi** instructed **True Lord of the Southern Pole** (*Nánjí Zhēngōng*):\n*\"How old are you?\"*\nThe True Lord replied:\n*\"I am one hundred and seventeen years old.\nWhen I must walk, I walk;\nwhen I must run, I run.\nMy **qi-force** does not wane,\nand my hair, once white, will never darken again.\"*\n**Laozi** said:\n*\"White hair is trivial—\nyour body has yet to escape Water and Fire’s afflictions.\"*\nThe True Lord pondered this for a long time,\nthen realized its meaning.\nHe prostrated himself twice,\nbegging:\n*\"I humbly implore the Most High’s boundless compassion\nto save my withered bones,\ngranting me the path of eternal life.\nMoreover, I have always heeded your teachings,\nyet you say my body has not escaped Water and Fire’s calamities—\nhow then can I attain the rank of the Immortals?\nI do not know how to escape Water and Fire’s afflictions.\nThese Water and Fire afflictions are called **‘years of ruin’** (*huài jié* 坏劫),\nand yet, what specific year will they arrive?\"*\n\n**Laozi** laughed for a long time,\nthen spoke:\n*\"The Water and Fire ruin—\nthat is your body.\nIf your body does not escape Water and Fire,\nthen all will be destroyed and ruined—\nthus, it is called **‘ruin of the years’** (*huài jié*).\nThe heavens and earth have no set time for collapse.\nNow, I reveal the **meaning and talismanic key** of Water and Fire.\nThis scroll contains them.\nAfter nine years of practice,\nthe Dao will be perfected,\nand you shall become the **True Lord of the Southern Pole**—\n**Zhèng Rén’ān** (*郑仁安*), whose given name is **Zǐ Zāi** (*郑子崎*).\nThe *Běnxíng Jīng* (*Scripture of Original Conduct*) states:\n*\"The **Red Emperor of the South** (*Chìdì* 赤帝) is **Zhèng Rén’ān**.\"*\nEven now, he still wears these two talismans,\nalong with the *Five Talismans* belt.\n\n**Third Talismans of Metal, Wood, and Earth.**\n**Note:** These three talismans\nare worn by those of earnest resolve\naccording to the seasons,\nand used in morning rituals.\nThey are also observed on **natal days**, **Gēngshēn days** (*庚申*), and **Jiǎzǐ days** (*甲子*).\nOn other days, they are not worn—\nthese are called the **Five Phases Talismans**.\nFor those practicing Water and Fire,\nthese talismans are always worn on the head,\nnever removed,\nand changed every two years.\nAll are inscribed by the **original teacher**,\neach bearing a specific date.\nThe **Later Saints’** talismans instructed **Yīn Xiānsheng** (*尹先生*):\n*\"The Five Talismans of the *Soul Treasures* are inscribed on different days.\nThe **eastern green talisman** (*Qīngfú* 青符) is written on **Spring Begins** (*Lìchūn* 立春),\nrequested from the original teacher,\nand worn on the back of the left elbow.\nThe **southern red talisman** (*Chìfú* 赤符) is written on **Summer Begins** (*Lìxià* 立夏).\nThe **western white talisman** (*Báifú* 白符) is written on **Autumn Begins** (*Lìqiū* 立秋).\nThe **northern black talisman** (*Hēifú* 黑符) is written on **Winter Begins** (*Lìdōng* 立冬).\nThe **central yellow talisman** (*Huángfú* 黄符) is written on **Winter Solstice** (*Dōngzhì* 冬至).\nAnd on **Pure Brightness Day** (*Qīngmíng* 清明) in spring,\nand **Duanwu Day** (*Duānwǔ* 端午) in summer,\neach is written on the day corresponding to the seasonal **pure qi** (*zhèngqì* 正气).\nIf one cannot adhere to the seasonal **rectification of qi** (*zhèngqì* 正气) days,\nthen on the **fifth of the fifth month** (*Wǔyuè wǔ* 五月五),\n**ninth of the ninth month** (*Jiǔyuè jiǔ* 九月九),\nor **tenth of the tenth month** (*Shíyuè shí* 十月十).\nThese three months’ days are also acceptable.\nWhen writing these talismans,\nthe **original teacher** must inscribe them\nin a state of purity,\nafter fasting and abstaining,\nand at **midday** (*shízhōng* 日中),\nbefore bestowing them upon the disciple,\nwho should then wear them.\nThe **wood talisman** is worn on the back of the left elbow,\nthe **fire talisman** on the head,\nthe **metal talisman** on the back of the right elbow,\nthe **water talisman** around the waist,\nand the **earth talisman** upon the back.\nFor the **Five Talismans** above,\neach must be stored in a **silken pouch** (*jǐnchuāi* 锦袋).\nOne inscription lasts five years.\nIf there is no original teacher,\nor if the teacher is elderly and unable to inscribe,\nthen a **worthy disciple** (*bǎojǔ shī* 保举师) should write them.\nIf none is found,\nthen a **high-ranking adept** (*fǎluò gāozǔ* 法箓高三五足) from the assembly may inscribe.\nWhen obtaining such a person’s name,\nthe **Five Phases’ keys** are revealed.\nDo not recklessly practice—\nlet not one who cannot receive **efficacious qi** (*língqì* 灵炁) inscribe them,\nnor one who knows not their meaning.\nThe **Five Stars and Five Emperors** will not submit to such.\nEach must be inscribed by the original teacher,\non the days of the **Five Laws and Five Talismans**,\nas with the **talismanic scriptures** (*luò* 箓),\nand each must be transmitted to disciples who chant and recite,\nteaching them the **method of enlightenment** (*míngdù fǎ* 明度法).\nIf the teacher does not know the **Five Laws** as the **keys to escaping the Five Phases**,\nnor the **efficacious texts** (*língwén* 灵文) that avert great and small calamities,\nthen they should not separately inscribe the talismans along with the transmission.\nInstead, from **Spring Begins** onward,\n*(as noted previously)*\nrequest a **clear teacher** (*míngshī* 明师) to inscribe them,\nand wear them according to the seasons.\nIf fearing that the Five Phases’ calamities may approach,\nthen inscribe them on a **auspicious day** (*jí rì* 吉日),\nor on **Duanwu Day** (*Wǔyuè wǔ* 五月五) or **Chóngyáng Day** (*Jiǔyuè jiǔ* 九月九)—\nthese two days are **‘days of extending life and dispelling calamities’** (*xùmìng xiāozāi* 续命消灾),\nand thus are acceptable.\n\n**Guāngchéng Jūn** inscribed the Water and Fire talismans\non **Duanwu Day** (*Wǔyuè wǔ* 五月五),\nand at midday bestowed them upon **Yellow Emperor** (*Huángdì*).\n**Yellow Emperor** then prostrated himself twice and asked:\n*\"First, you dispelled Water and Fire—\nthen, how do you escape the Five Phases?\"*\n**Note:** Though the **true Immortals of the Most High Way** possess\n**spiritual mobility and freedom** (*shén tōng zìrán* 神通自在),\ntheir bodies have yet to escape Water and Fire.\nThough their hearts have escaped Water and Fire’s afflictions,\ntheir bodies remain trapped within them.\n\nThe body and mind both transcend Heaven and Earth, yet Water and Fire remain unvanquished.\n\nWhen speaking of the calamities of Water and Fire, those whose body and mind both transcend Heaven and Earth—meaning they have escaped Water and Fire, departed the Three Realms—are called **Middle True Great Immortals**. The Three Realms are Metal, Wood, and Earth.\n\nMetal: The vulgar scholars, following the Buddha’s teachings, liken Metal to precious gems, jade, and treasures that do not attract women or music—unaffected by them.\n\nEarth: The vulgar scholars liken Earth to official rank, honor, wealth, and the arrogance of territorial rule—unaffected by them.\n\nWood: The vulgar scholars interpret Wood as not sitting in pavilions, halls, or lofty structures, with no attachments of the heart—this is called the mind transcending the Three Realms. This, according to Daoist classification, is called the mind transcending, yet the body has not yet transcended.\n\nWhen the body fails, the next life’s body will again suffer the afflictions of honor and nobility—still within the Three Realms, governed by the Five Phases—this is called the body not transcending the Five Phases.\n\nI have grasped the essence of the **Middle True**, dispelling Water and Fire calamities, transcending the Five Phases, surpassing the Three Realms, and dwelling with body and mind intact, traversing Heaven, Earth, Water, and Fire without harm.\n\nWearing the talisman for one year dispels the Five Sorrows and Nine Calamities.\nFor two years, one can repel all poisons and subdue the Five Armies.\nFor three years, one avoids death and rebirth.\nFor four years, one receives a worldly appointment—named **Book of the Jade Capital**.\nFor five years, one escapes Water and Fire.\n**Note:** To depart from their afflictions is to no longer consume the *qi* of Water and Fire; their *qi* cannot harm those who wear the talisman.\n\n**Laozi, the Most High Venerable, told Mr. Yin:**\n*\"Wearing the Water and Fire talismans for five years renders Water and Fire powerless to harm.\nWearing the Metal, Wood, and Earth talismans renders Metal unable to conquer, Wood unable to harm, and Earth unable to injure. The Five Phases depart from the body, making it firm and enduring—long-lived, yet not attaining the rank of the lower-grade Immortals.\"*\n\nIn six and seven years, one gradually attains wondrous powers.\nAt forty-nine years, one ascends in broad daylight.\n**Note:** The Five Phases’ ultimate subtlety lies in Water and Fire, which govern life, growth, sickness, and decay.\n\n**Laozi told the Great True Ones:**\n*\"The characters Water and Fire are not merely feared by beings of the lower realms for their power over success and failure.\n**Note:** Because humans have fate and rely on water for sustenance, escaping creation and avoiding decay is difficult—that is why they are feared.\n\nEven the highest True Immortals, in their constant practice, still employ talismanic steps to avoid their original fate.\n**Note:** *Fate* refers to one’s destiny.\nThe Dao Lord was born in the *yin* hour of the Fire Phase, always using the *bing* hour of the Water Phase to manipulate Water talismans, then the Fire talismans, to seek longevity. How much more so for worldly folk, who do not seek immortality, yet must observe their natal day’s talismans.\n\nThe natal day’s Earth Phase rises first; the worldly Earth corresponds to the *Zhen* star, dispersing *qi* from the Earthly Palace.\n**Note:** *Palace* refers to **Di Huang** (地皇).\nSurname: Palace; given name: Wind.\nDi Huang ruled with Earth’s virtue, piling earth to form platforms, erecting stone pillars, and digging earthen chambers.\n**Note:** High earthen mounds were built, over a hundred *zhang* tall, with four-directional cavities as palatial dwellings. These cavities were called the Palace surname.\n\nWhy is the character *Palace* (宮) written with a doubled mouth radical?\nBecause palaces were built of earth, with layered towers, and chambers dug to shelter people—*Palace* (宮) carries the meaning of layered accumulation, hence the doubled mouth radical. Over time, the upper layers collapsed, damaging the lower ones.\n\nThe **Human Sovereign** observed this, knowing that the upper collapse and lower damage of the Palace chambers were written as *harm* (害), resembling *Palace* (宮), thus depicting the destructive force of collapse. The lower mouth radical signifies the upper overcoming the lower.\n\nThus, the character *harm* (害) spread in the world, corresponding to the Earth star, bringing destructive *qi* that injures and kills people.\n\nA large chamber is called a *Palace*, and Palace became a surname.\nToday, those with the Palace surname are honored, reflecting Di Huang’s intention to elevate humanity—thus, the Earth surname is revered as the first of the Five Phases.\n\nThey intermarried with the Zheng surname, producing six sons.\nThe eldest changed his surname to Wind, the second to Gong, the third to Worker, the fourth, fifth, and sixth retained the Palace surname.\n\nWhen the Zheng wife died, he again intermarried with a Shang surname descendant, producing another six sons.\nThe eldest changed his surname to Gongsun, the second to Li, the third to Fei,\n**Note:** Today’s surnames Zhan and Ren are derived from this.\nthe fourth, fifth, and sixth retained the Palace surname.\n\nMoreover, Di Huang had twelve sons, taking the abundant *qi* of Earth.\nHe intermarried with the five surnames, and their descendants became kings, mirroring the Earth star’s retrograde cycle through the four seasons.\nThus, Earth’s sovereign rule over the four seasons was established.\nThe Earth’s harmful *qi* constantly circulates through the seasons, and those whose fate aligns with it suffer illness within ten days.\nThose who know this manipulate Wood talismans, step the Wood Array,\n**Note:** The Eastern Host of Seven Stars is the Wood Array.\nto disperse it and halt the affliction.\nThus, Earth fears Wood, for Wood can conquer Earth.\nEarth constantly supports Wood, yet Wood fears it in return.\n\nPractitioners with an Earth destiny should manipulate Metal talismans to stop Wood calamities.\nThose with a Wood destiny should manipulate Fire talismans to stop Metal.\nThose with a Metal destiny should manipulate Water talismans to stop Fire.\nThose with a Fire destiny should manipulate Earth talismans to stop Water.\nThose with a Water destiny should manipulate Wood talismans to stop Earth.\n\nThus, within the Five Phases, the Earth Phase harbors the most destructive *qi*.\nAll Five Phases’ mutual generation and conquest are subsumed within Earth’s influence.\nMoreover, the Earth star completes a cycle every thirty-five years, governing the Nine Regions and the Five Phases.\n\nAmong the Five Tones, *Gong* (宮) is primary.\nIf following the *Fei* Step Talisman’s teachings, then Metal is primary.\nThe two accounts differ.\n**Note:** According to the *San Cai Lun* (三才论), Heaven, Earth, and Human are called the Three Powers.\n\nFrom the moment Heaven arises, Earth immediately follows.\nEarth is established, and then **Earth Phase** is born from Earth.\nThe Earth that comes before is **Metal**, and Earth produces Metal—so Metal is primary.\n\nAccording to *Master Yin’s Record* (《尹先生记》), the *Divine Record of All Spirits* (《神灵具录》) states:\nThe **Venerable Laozi’s** mother was of **Metal destiny**, and from her arose the **Venerable Laozi**.\nThe **Venerable Laozi** then ascended and took the position of **Posterior Sage Celestial Sovereign** (后圣天尊).\nThus, when he proclaimed the talisman to the **Three Officials of the Northern Dipper** (命三官北斗咒),\nhe said: *\"Metal, Water, Fire, Wood, Earth—\nthe Way’s principles never stray from their natural connections.*\nAll Five Phases are means of generation,\nyet they dwell upon Earth.\nThe **Posterior Sage Sovereign** takes Metal as primary.\"\n\nFor Earth is the **longest of the Three Realms** (三界).\nThe **Venerable Laozi** declared to all **Imperial Sovereigns** (帝君):\n*\"I often ponder the **Lower Truth** and **Upper Immortals** (下真上仙),\nthose who seek the Dao without departing the Three Realms.\nHow can they attain imperishability and non-extinction?\nYou have mastered the Three Realms—\nwhy not awaken and guide those who remain unenlightened,\nso they may forever transcend and escape the Three Realms,\nunobstructed by **demonic thieves** (魔贼).\nBeyond the Three Realms lies the **Three Pure Ones** (三清),\nwhere the **Supreme Truth** (至真) resides.\nIs this not the **palace of compassionate efficacy** (慈力济度之功),\nthe **peerless virtue** (无上之德) of the body?\"*\n\nFire is the **male of the Three Realms** (三界之男人).\nWithout Fire, one’s destiny is incomplete.\nThus, one must borrow **qi** to refine it,\nnurturing the **vital roots** (身根) for longevity’s pulse.\n\nWater is the **consort of the Three Realms** (三界之妻).\nWithout Water, humans perish;\nwith Water, humans live.\nLife and death both depend on Water,\nwhich nourishes all things—\nhow much more so the human body alone?\n\nThe **Posterior Sage Sovereign**’s talisman commands the **Three Realms’ Destructive King** (命三界魔王):\n*\"Your domain encompasses the Three Realms—\nall beings and figures return to you.\nWithout the Three Realms, nothing is born;\nwithout the Three Realms, nothing is nurtured;\nwithout the Three Realms, nothing grows.\nFrom birth to death, they cycle endlessly,\nyet none know how to return.\nWater and Fire never cease—\nlife and death return to Earth.\nNo high nor low, no old nor young—\nall come and go, lost in delusion.\nThey do not know where their minds originate,\nyet they seek escape from the Three Realms.\nThe **demonic kings** all kneel and bow twice,\nbegging to transcend the Three Realms,\nbut their minds cling—\nthey do not know to abandon Water and Fire,\nand thus their bodies starve and die.\nWithout Water and Fire, food cannot be refined;\nwithout Earth, Water and Fire cannot dwell and interact.\nThus, I know that such beings\ncannot step away from suffering—\nhow can they escape the Three Realms?\"*\n\nThe **Posterior Sage Sovereign** replied:\n*\"There are six methods to escape the Three Realms.\nIf one follows them, the body and mind naturally transcend the Three Realms.\nWhy restrict oneself from Water and Fire?\"*\n\nFor Water and Fire are the **true qi of Yin and Yang** (阴阳之真炁),\nand Earth is the **master of the Five Phases** (五行之主).\nWhy would one remove them?\n\nMoreover, the **Supreme Celestial Immortals** (上圣天仙)\neach employ distinct methods.\nI shall now reveal them to you—\nlisten and receive them.\n\n**First Method:** The body and mind receive instruction,\nabandoning Water and excluding Fire.\n**Note:** Water and Fire are two **natures** (二性).\nThe **nature of Water and Fire** benefits humans—\nthis is called **virtue/power** (德).\nIf Water and Fire inflict harm upon humans,\nthis is called **theft** (贼).\nThus, this is the **second method**.\n\nHeaven cannot bring calamity,\nEarth cannot cause disaster.\n**Note:** When the mind excludes the **nature of Water and Fire**,\nHeaven cannot harm, Earth cannot ruin—\nthe body is at peace.\n\n**Second Method:** The body and mind are **Earth-locked**, **sealing the essence** (土镇锁津).\n**Note:** This metaphorically refers to **ascending immortals** (身上仙者) preserving their **vital essence** (精).\nThose who practice **chambered cultivation** (行房帷之事),\nmust **seal their essence** (闭精不泄).\nIf it leaks, the **spirit is diminished** (损神),\nand **vital essence exhaustion ruins the body** (少津败身).\nIf one can **store and return it to the spirit** (存归神),\nand **excess essence moistens the body** (溢津润身),\nthen **longevity’s pulse flows abundantly** (通多).\nMoreover, **practice must not be stagnant** (行不陈),\nand there are **precepts within the Dao** (自有经旨),\nthus attaining **Celestial Truth** (天真).\n\n**Third Method:** **Conquer Metal and regulate Fire** (制金理火).\n**Note:** The **root destiny day** (本命日) begins with one **step of the Yu’s tread** (地纪一遍),\nthen transforms into **Yu’s tread** (禹步),\nand the **Metal talisman** (捻金诀) is performed.\nOn the **left hand’s fingernail**, the **Fire talisman** (甲为火) is manipulated,\nand the **five fingers point to the Metal star** (指金星) three times.\nUpon completion, one recites the **Metal-Wood talisman** (金木咒),\ninvoking the **conquest of Metal and Wood** (金木相克), saying thus:\n*\"The seven stars shine resplendent,\nthe **Metal talisman** is most formidable.\"*\n\n**Fourth Method:** **Conquer Wood and regulate Metal** (制木理金).\n**Note:** The **root destiny day** (本命日) begins with one **step of the Heavenly Tread** (天纲一遍),\nthen transforms into **Yu’s tread** (禹步),\nand the **Wood talisman** (捻木诀) is performed.\nOn the **left hand**, one forms the **Metal Axe** (金斧),\nand points to the **Wood star** (指木星) three times.\nUpon completion, one **treads three times** (蹑三度),\nand recites the **Five Phases invocation** (五行祝),\nsaying: *\"The **Heavenly Tread talisman** (天纲中咒),\nMetal, Water, Wood, Fire, Earth—\nMetal and Wood mutually push aside,\nthe seven stars shine resplendent,\nthe **Heavenly Tread talisman** is most formidable.\"*\n\nThe **four methods above** are means to **dispel the Three Realms’ calamities** (消三界之灾害)\nand **harmonize the Five Phases’ mutual conquest** (五行之相人於难克).\nIf one follows these methods,\nwithin a year, the **five torments** (五苦), **eight hardships** (八难),\n**nine adversities** (九厄), and **hundred diseases** (百病) in the body\nshall naturally be eliminated.\nThis is called **alignment** (顺).\nThe original **teacher treads the Earthly Tread** (履地纪),\n**steps on the Dipper** (蹑斗),\nand upon **receiving transmission and guidance** (传度时受讫),\nnow practices the **root destiny day** (本命日) for **cultivation of the truth** (修真),\nthe methods to escape the Three Realms and Five Phases.\n\n**Note:** According to *The Secret Precepts of Inner Perfection from the Great Peace Scripture* (《太平经□内品修真秘诀》),\nthe **Uppermost Pure Immortal** (上清大真人) before ascending to Heaven\neach took their **root destiny day** (本命),\nand practiced the **four talismanic methods** (四等法诀).\nLater, they **trod the Dipper star** (步履斗星),\n**grasped the Earthly Tread** (镊地纪),\nand ascended through the **Heavenly Gate** (升登天门).\nThey then entered the **Golden Threshold and Jade Terrace** (金阙玉台),\nbecoming the **Posterior Sage Sovereign** (后圣君).\n\n**Fifth Method:** **Comprehensively conquer the Five Phases** (总制五行),\n**transcending them from the body’s exterior** (於身之外).\n**Note:** The **Posterior Sage Sovereign** said:\n*\"The **talisman given to the Heavenly Master** (授天师诀),\nthe method to **comprehensively conquer the Five Phases from the body’s exterior** (制五行於身之外法).\"*\n\nThe **Six Celestial Stems** (六甲) encompass **six periods** (六旬),\nand within each **six periods** (旬),\nthere is a **root destiny day** (本命日).\nFirst, one **treads the Earthly Tread** (蹑地纪),\nthen **treads the Three Platforms** (蹑三台),\nwhich is **treading the Five Stars** (履五星),\neach requiring **five repetitions** (各须五遍).\nOne recites the **Five Phases talismans** (五行咒) **eighteen times** (十八篇),\nand *The Rolling Pearl* (《流珠》) **upper scroll** (上卷) contains the precepts.\n\nThen, one **treads the Fire Tread** (步火纲) three times,\nand performs **three repetitions of forward, backward, and inverted steps** (顺、倒、反三遍).\nOne also recites the **three talismans of forward, backward, and inverted** (顺倒、反三等咒).\n\nUpon completion, one stands at the **eastern-southern earthly gate** (东南地户上立),\nfacing the **western-northern** direction,\n**storing thoughts of generals and soldiers** (存思将军吏兵).\nFirst, one **stores the Three Generals of Middle Element** (先存中元三将军),\nleading **soldiers and officials** (领吏兵) as per the diagram.\n**Middle Element** oversees the **host** (主人).\nNext, one **stores the Three Generals of Lower Element** (次下元三将军),\nleading **soldiers and officials** (领吏兵),\n**overseeing Earth** (主地).\n**The Palace** (宫) **declares the body’s merit** (奏身有功),\nand **cultivation is never incomplete** (修行不阙).\nThen, one **stores the Three Generals of Upper Element** (次上元三将军),\nleading **historians and soldiers** (领史兵) to descend and welcome.\n\n「Next, one **stores the Five Virtue Generals** (次五德将军),\nthen the **Heavenly Sovereign and Thunder General** (天公雷公等将军),\neach leading **myriad armies of soldiers and horses** (兵马百千万众),\nas **five clouds soar through the void** (五云飞空),\nwhile the **Golden Just Strength-Soldiers** (金刚力士) **guide the body** (引身),\nascending to pay homage to the **Emperor of the Great Peace Golden Threshold** (太平金阙帝) **and the Holy Sovereign of the Morning Court** (晨后圣君).\n\n**Store them as per the diagram of the Three Element Generals** (存之如三元将军图),\nwearing **official headdress and sash** (具冠简),\nin **purple robes** (紫衣),\nwith **all attendants following as prescribed** (如法诸卫从),\naccording to the **three diagrams of Han Hong** (如含弘等三图).\n**Store them only after donning the prescribed attire and headdress** (存之，唯加具衣冠简).\n\n**The Six Methods** (六法),\nare to be performed on the **fixed hour of Regal Monkey** (庚申初夜),\n*[Note: the first watch is Regal Monkey]* (注：初夜一更是).\nOn **Earthly Horse’s initial night** (己未日初夜),\nenter the **fifth watch** (入五更是).\n**Regal Monkey’s day is set for this** (庚申日定之也).\nWhen **storing thoughts** (思存出),\nfollow the **Han Hong diagram** (如含弘图).\n\nThis is to **sever and cut off calamities of the Three Realms** (断截三界灾厄),\n**the Three Corpses and Six Demons** (三尸六魔),\n**the Three Officials and Nine Earths** (三官九地),\n**root out sinful causes** (落灭罪根),\n**augment life longevity** (添益寿算),\n**remove the death ledgers of the Three Officials** (落除三官死簿),\nand **inscribe the True Spirit’s celestial register of birth** (注上生历神真之位).\n\nUpon completion, **knock the teeth thirty-six times** (毕，叩齿三十六通).\n**Hold firm** (握固),\nthen **twirl the talisman of one’s own life span and sovereign fate** (即捻本身司命诀),\nand **ingest the talisman dispelling the Three Corpses** (服去三尸之符).\n*[Note: the talisman is found in *The Sacred Scriptures of the Fifty Generals* (符在《五十将军灵书》中).]*\n\nUpon completion, **lie down in repose** (即任安卧).\n**Awake before and after the second watch of Earthly Horse** (卧起五更二点前后).\n**Again store thoughts** (又思存),\nas before.\n\nAfter **one cycle** (一度讫),\n**swallow the talisman** (吞符).\n**Practice this twelve times** (行之一十二度),\nand the **Three Corpses demons will depart forever** (三尸虫永去),\n**even in death, they dare not return** (死亦不敢来),\nthus becoming **a person of the Highest True** (上真之人),\n**worthy of honor and protection** (可贵可保).\n\nThis method is **subtle and profound** (微妙),\n**unfit for reckless transmission to the unworthy** (不可妄传非人),\nlest calamity befalls the **seven ancestral masters** (殃及七祖矣).\n\n---\n**End of

are known as the **Ancient Method**,\nWith eighty-one as their extreme limit.\nNow, these eighty-one generate the myriad phenomena of the revolving heavens—\nA number beyond comprehension.\n\nThere are three grades.\n\n**The Highest Grade:** The talismans enter the **Upper Primordial**,\n*Annotation:* Known as the **Lord Lao’s Six Jia Talismans**—those used today.\nCalled the **Lord Lao’s Inner Secrets: Three Talismans, Six Jia Scriptures.**\nWhen mortals encounter them,\nWith sincere devotion and diligent practice,\nThey are freed from a hundred ailments,\nAnd the Six Spirits arrive.\n*Annotation:* The Six Spirits are:\n1. The Six Jia Generals,\n2. The Six Jia Day Officials,\n3. The Six Jia Jade Boys and Jade Girls,\n4. The Day Official Attendants,\n5. The Direct Talisman,\n6. The Talisman Clerks—six in total.\nThey capture evil and inspect the essences—\nNone are without spiritual efficacy.\nFor those who tread the Daoist path,\nNone can succeed without them.\nIf there are those with sincere devotion and joy in the Dao,\nThey must first master the talismans,\nStabilize the soul and calm the spirit,\nAnchor the essence and solidify the form,\nAnd forever secure the root of longevity,\nThe gateway to attaining the Dao.\nThe seals of invocation are opened—\nWhatever is summoned, stored, or employed,\nThis is the **Chief Messenger of Announcement**,\nThe **Commander-in-Chief of the Three Officials**.\n\nThe **Preface to the Lord Lao’s Six Jia Talismans** states:\n*\"All the myriad gods of Heaven and Earth are the subordinates of the Six Jia.\"*\n*Annotation:* Within the vast cosmos,\nThere are myriad gods and spirits,\nTen thousand evils and myriad essences,\nAll recorded and commanded by the Six Jia,\nAnd all are the servants of the Six Jia.\nThus, mortals who know this\nReceive the Six Jia Scriptures,\nServe the Six Jia Talismans,\nAnd wear the **Six Jia Direct Spirit Plaques**—\nThis is to measure the depth of their merit,\nTo drive the myriad spirits,\nAnd to aid the nation and save the people.\n\nIn the ancient past, all who cultivated the Dao\nAttained it through the Six Jia.\n*Annotation:* The Six Jia are the foremost of the **Six Primordial Methods**—\nThe sacred path of the **Ancient Sage Lord Lao** and the **Later Sage Jade Emperor**,\nThe gateway and the thoroughfare of cultivation.\n\n**The Middle Grade:** The Six Jia are called **Lingfei**,\nCommanding **1,360 Jade Boys** and **2,440 Jade Girls.**\n\nThe **Lord Lao’s Secret Six Jia Talismans** include:\nEleven Great Generals,\n1,200 Attendants,\n970 Jade Boys, Jade Girls, and Talisman Clerks,\nAnd countless soldiers, beasts, and messengers—\nSufficient to field **120,000 troops** for the Highest Grade.\n\nThe **Most High Lord Lao** established the **Six Jia of Heaven and Earth**,\nWith six camps, each divided into four divisions.\nOne division resides within the human body—\n*[Note: Further annotations to follow.]*\n\n「Lingfei is of the Middle Grade, included in the count of the **Upper Pure** (上清).\n\nThe Five Phases and Six Jia form the **Lower Grade**, hence this is called the **Three Grades of Six Jia**.\n\nThose who practice the Dao must all cultivate and revere the **Three Grades of Six Jia**.\n\n*Annotation:* The Upper and Middle Grades—\nTaking them daily for **fourteen years** grants ascension to the Dao.\n\nThe **Lower Grade Six Jia** expel misfortune from the body,\nAnd are used in calculations for **decrepit kings** (算衰王).\n\nThe **Later Sage Lord Lao** instructed the **Jade Boys and Ladies of the Rectangular Array** (方诸童君夫人):\n*\"For those who wish to cultivate the body and prolong life,\nFirst, they must cultivate and ingest the divine talismans of the Six Jia.\nThis was the most sacred method of the **Earlier Sage**,\nCommonly known as the **Lord Lao’s Secret Six Jia Talismans**.\nThe method of ingestion is as follows:\nEach time one recites the names of the **Divine Officials** (神直官),\nOne summons the **Talisman Clerks of the Decade** (旬将),\nAnd the names of the **Jade Girls**.\n\nUpon summoning, one must recite the **Earlier Sage’s Long-Life Incantation** (前圣长生咒) twice,\nThen swallow the talisman.\n\nAfter **three years** of swallowing the talisman,\nOne then ingests the **Lingfei Six Jia Talismans**,\nSwallowing them in the same manner as the **Lord Lao’s Secret Six Jia Talismans**.\nOnce finished, proceed to swallow the **Lingfei Six Jia Talismans**.\n\nThe talismans must all be inscribed with the names of the **Divine Officials**, **Talisman Clerks**, and **Jade Girls**.\nOne must call upon each by name.\n\nThe Master says:\n*\"The secret lies in this:\nThe Six Jia deities have many repeated names and surnames,\nAnd one cannot remember them all.\nThus, small wooden or bamboo plaques are made,\nUpon which the names of the deities, generals, clerks, and jade girls are inscribed,\nAnd each is recorded accordingly.\nWhether standing, walking, sitting, or reclining,\nOne must always bear their names in mind.\nIn urgent matters, one must blow upon and invoke the talismans,\nTo rescue people, subdue ghosts, expel evil, and repel harm.\nIf one’s life is in peril, the plaques should be taken out,\nAnd the names invoked immediately—\nThe response will be instantaneous.\n\nHowever, when sleeping at night or entering a woman’s chamber,\nOne must hang them in a secure place on the wall or pillar,\nAnd they will still be effective.\nDo not hang them on the doorframe,\nFor the **Doorframe Deities** (门户神) may fear them,\nCausing unrest.\n\nOne must commit their names to memory.\nWhen urgently invoking them,\nIt must be done as swiftly as **hand responds to heart** (手应心),\nAnd as decisively as **heart commands the mouth** (心制口).\n*Annotation:* In the **Upper Ancient** (上古) era, great Daoists practiced **direct heart-mouth control** (直心制口),\nWhere their words were never misspoken.\nThus, a heart’s vow is the same as a mouth’s vow—\nIt must be genuine.\nThis is the practice of the **Dao Immortals** (仙人).\n\nThe talismans will arrive immediately upon invocation.\nOne must remember their names and surnames,\nAnd keep them in mind during leisure hours.\nWhen urgently invoked,\nTheir power will manifest instantly.\nMoreover, before eating or drinking,\nOne must first mentally invoke them,\nAnd maintain the presence of the **Divine Officials**, **Talisman Clerks of the Decade**, and **Jade Girls** throughout the day.\nIf one shares food and drink with them as subjects,\nThey will bestow the **Mysterious Sweet Offerings** (玄甘飨).\nWhen consuming various foods, drinks, or fruits,\nOne must always mentally invoke them daily,\nAnd share in the same food and drink.\nThis practice, when consistently applied,\nWill yield great efficacy.\n\nThey can also suppress **army disasters** (兵害) and subdue **heavenly demons** (天魔).\n*Annotation:* In antiquity, a Daoist in the mountains named **Li Boyao** (李伯药),\nOften cultivated the **Six Jia Method** and ingested the talismans.\nHe stayed in the mountains for five years without emerging.\n\nOne day, suddenly, he saw a man in green robes,\nRiding a leopard, offering a small bottle.\nThe man said:\n*\"This is the **Great Elixir Master Boyao** (大丹伯药).\nYou have nearly attained the Dao,\nBut your form and spirit are withering.\nYou must ingest this elixir,\nAnd you will achieve long life.\nI have come today to bestow this medicine upon you—\nThis is the **True Great Reversion Elixir** (真大还丹).\nHere is a golden bottle.\nLook, the bottle contains the **True Golden Elixir** (真金丹),\nWith pills of a **purple-gold hue** (紫金色).\nI tell you, my disciples:\nI have now attained the Dao.\nThe **Daoist Messengers** (仙使) have brought me the **Great Elixir** (太丹).\nI will take it and ascend to the heavens.\nYou must follow my practice,\nAnd never waver in your resolve—\nYou will surely also obtain this elixir.\nOn the day of my departure,\nCome to the heavens to seek me out.\"\n\nLi Boyao’s disciple, **Wei Xiang** (韦祥), did not yet understand,\nAnd only heard voices in the forest,\nAs if from hundreds of people,\nIncluding the sounds of women.\n\nIn a short while, one voice issued orders:\n*\"Seize him!\"*\nImmediately, over ten men in red robes,\nClad as **leopard-riding messengers** (乘豹使者),\nCaptured and threw the man to the ground.\nHe transformed into an **Old Dragon** (老龙),\nAnd the leopard into an **Old Tiger** (老虎).\nThey struck him with twenty blows.\n\nWith a stern command, they declared:\n*\"Li Boyao has attained the Dao,\nThough he has not yet gained renown—\nHe has long been inscribed in the **Daoist Register** (仙籍).\nHow dare he act as a **malevolent ghost** (为祟),\nSeeking to harm with poisonous elixir!\"*\n\nLi Boyao knew this was not a true person,\nAnd questioned them about their origins.\nThe **Jade Girl of Jia-Shen** (甲申玉女) responded:\n*\"The **Heavenly Demon Poison Ghosts** (天魔毒鬼),\nTransformed into an Old Dragon and Old Tiger,\nTo harm you.\nIf you do not diligently cultivate the Six Jia,\nYou will surely fall to their poison and die.\"*\n\nIn a short while, the **Dragon and Tiger Poison Ghosts** (龙虎毒) all dissolved into ghosts and perished.\nWere it not for the **Six Jia Deities’ power** (六甲神之功),\nLi Boyao would not have been saved,\nAnd would have been poisoned by the **Heavenly Demon’s elixir** (天魔进药) and died.\n\nNow, this account is recorded for the world.\nPeople should not presume to refuse or neglect them—\nThe **Heavenly Demon** will take back the elixir,\nAnd depart in submission after bowing.\nThey will no longer dare to harm others,\nAnd such instances often occur.\nThis allows one to earn merit and attain the Dao.»\n\n「You, among the various teachings, have shown true earnestness.\nThus, you must first diligently cultivate the **Three Elements** (三元) and **Six Jia** (六甲),\nAnd over time, you will naturally attain communion with the gods.\nThis method is subtle and profound,\nAnd should not be carelessly transmitted to those unworthy.\n\n**Laozi** (老君) said:\n*\"This method possesses six divine powers (六通神力).\nFirst, it grants passage into the **Great Dao’s Gate** (大道之门),\nSkillfully leveraging the **Dao’s authority** (假道威),\nSubduing gods and enslaving ghosts,\nQuelling and annihilating malevolent spirits and **Jiao-demons** (精妖),\nSevering and dispelling **Feng-spirits** (凶祟).\n\nSecond, it allows communion with the **Heavenly Realm** (通天),\nInspiring the **Heavenly Gods** (天神) and **Heavenly Dragons** (天龙)\nTo exterminate demons and subdue **Heavenly Conflicts** (祆).\nIt can gather clouds and summon rains,\nCountering the **obstructive and malevolent qi of rebellious spirits** (逆横祆恶之炁),\nAnd effectively dispel such calamities.\n\nThird, it grants communion with the **Earthly Realm** (通地),\nInspiring the **Earthly Gods** (地神) and **Earthly Dragons** (地龙),\nAs well as the **Wind and Cloud Lords** (风云雷公),\n**Lightning, Rain, and Wind Officials** (电师雨师风师),\nThe **Five Sacred Mountains** (五岳) and **Four Celestial Constraints** (四镇).\n*Note: The Four Celestial Constraints are also called the Four Rivers (四渎), the official waters that constrain the mountains.*\nThe **Nine Regions and Ten Thousand States, Myriad Countries** (九州千邦万国),\nAnd all **terrestrial deities** (土地山川神灵),\n**Ancestral shrines and city gods** (社庙城隍),\n*Note: City God (城隍神) is a deity appointed by the later Sage Emperor (后圣君) to oversee the Underworld (地府).*\nAs recorded in the **Sū Brū** (苏吴纪纪云): *\"King Fú of Wú\"* (吴王苪是).\nThe **Left Ancestral and Right Harvest Deities** (左社右稷神官).\nThey will assist the realm,\nProtect your person and family,\nAnd aid all living beings.\n\nFourth, it grants communion with the **Watery Realm** (通水),\nInspiring the **Water Gods** (水神) and **Water Dragons** (水龙),\nAs well as the **Water Officials** (水中君官),\n**Generals and Spirit Ministers** (将军灵吏),\nAnd all **fish, scales, and beasts** (鱼鳞兽等).\nThey will assist the **Dao** and protect your person,\nHelp your family and realm,\nAnd aid all living beings.\n\nFifth, it grants communion to **guard and shield** (通感卫) the person.\nIf one persistently cultivates and practices it,\nOne’s body and family will transcend the **Five Phases** (五行),\nAnd achieve eternal harmony.\nIt removes the **Five Sufferings** (五苦),\n**Eight Hardships** (八难),\nAnd **Nine Calamities** (九厄),\nAnd all diseases will naturally vanish.\nOne will rise above the **Three Realms** (三界),\nAttain **Long Life** (长生),\nAnd command the **Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water** (天地水三官神灵),\nWith distinct and clear results.\n\nSixth, it grants communion to **command the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper** (七星北斗君),\n**Divine Consorts and Ladies** (神妃后女),\n*Note: Within the Northern Dipper (北斗), there is one Principal Lady (正后),\nThree Consorts (三妃),\nTwo Ladies-in-Waiting (二夫人),\nAnd two Delicate Damsels (并二娇女),\nAll holding titles as the Seven Officials of the Northern Dipper (北斗之七君位号).*\nAnd others, to oversee the **register of human deaths** (主世人之死簿).\nWhen people learn of this,\nThey often take **Six Jia Days** (六甲日) to create diagrams,\nFirst following the **Earthly Measure** (地纪),\nThen the **Heavenly Measure** (天纲),\nAnd finally the **Yǔ Steps** (禹步).\n*Note: The Three Measures (三等) correspond to the Three Elements (三元数).*\nCommon folk follow the **Heavenly Measure** (步纲),\nUsing the **Earthly Measure** (地纪) as the **Upper Element** (上元).\nImmortals follow the **Heavenly Measure** (步纲),\nUsing the **Heavenly Measure** (天纲) as the **Upper Element** (上元).\nAs **Yǐn Shòu** (尹寿子) said:\n*\"For common folk, whose bodies have not yet transcended the Three Realms (三界),\nThey follow the Earthly Measure (地纪) first,\nThus making it the Upper Element (上元).\nFor Immortals, whose bodies have transcended the Three Realms of Water, Fire, and Earth (水火三界),\nThey follow the Heavenly Measure (天纲) first,\nThus making it the Upper Element (上元).\nMoreover, the practice of the Heavenly Measure (步纲法),\nMust be completed in three full sets of steps,\nCalled the Heavenly Measure Steps (步纲数).\nThis is referred to as the **Heavenly, Earthly, and Human** (天地人),\nWhich corresponds to the method of transcending the Three Realms and Three Calamities (三界三灾),\nAnd entering the path of **Divine Immortality** (神仙),\nThe **Dao of Long Life and Non-Death** (长生不死之道).\nThere is a secret formula within the *Líu Zhū Shàng Yǐn* (流珠上引).\n*Note: The formula is found in the first volume of the *Líu Zhū Shàng Yǐn* (流珠上引).*\nAll who learn the **Dao** (学道者),\nShould understand this principle,\nAnd thus know the **Six Jia’s Six Powers** (六甲六通),\nTo transcend the Three Realms of Water and Fire (离水火三界之法),\nAnd avoid the calamities of the **Seven Mansions** (去七宿之灾害).\n*Note: The Southern Dipper (南斗) oversees the vital qi (王炁) of all people,\nCausing them to attain early birth, longevity, and prosperity (早得生荣长年),\nAnd wishes that people do not die.\nThe Northern Dipper (北斗) oversees the declining qi (衰炁) of all people,\nCausing them to fall ill early and die from severe disease (早得疾病，病极而死).\nThe later Sage Emperor (后圣君) greatly abhorred this,\nThus he reversed the roles of the Northern and Southern Dippers (前后易身出世),\nAnd revealed the **Divine Talismans and Secret Dao** (告命灵符秘法),\nInterpreting the *Jīn Suǒ Líu Zhū* (金锁流珠) as a new name,\nChanging the old terminology of *Jīn Luó* (金箓),\nClarifying the method of following the Heavenly and Earthly Measures (明出天纲地纪步蹑之道),\nTo subdue and control the **six yin deities of the Northern Dipper** (制伏北斗中六阴之神灾害炁),\nEternally attaining the **Dao of Long Life and Divine Immortality** (永出长生仙道),\nAnd avoiding the influence of the Northern Dipper (得离北斗之下).\nWhen common folk encounter this,\nThey all know to practice and cultivate it.\nIf they do so with sincerity and achieve results,\nThe six yin deities of the Northern Dipper—\nThe **Consorts, Ladies, and Delicate Damsels** (神君妃后娇女等)—\nWill fear and submit to their commands,\nUsing them as **divine garments** (为衣),\nAnd following their hand gestures to open the **Heavenly Gate** (转天关),\nSubduing all **Heavenly Demons and Earthly Conflicts** (摄天魔地祆).\nThis is what the later Sage Emperor (后圣君) taught in his great transmission.\nIt allows one to attain the Dao (得道),\nAnd ascend to the heavens (上升云天).\n\n**Laozi, the Most High Sage** (太上老君),\nExplained the **Secret Talismans of the Six Jia** (六甲秘符文) as follows:\n*\"I practiced the Six Jia Talismans (服六甲符),\nFirst receiving the **Preceptor’s Instructions** (先师令服授文).\nFor sixty days (六十日),\nI gradually began to understand.\nAfter one hundred and twenty days (一百二十日),\nAll hundred diseases retreated (百病退).\nAfter two hundred and forty days (二百四十日),\nAll hundred diseases were eliminated (百病消除).\"*」\n\n「Three hundred and sixty days,\nThe **Celestial Maiden** (玉女) attends and guards the **soul and vital essence** (魂魄),\nOften appearing in dreams as if in person.\n\nAt one thousand days,\nThe Celestial Maiden will manifest during the day,\nGuarding both the **Divine Essence** (神) and the **Divine Officials** (官).\n*Note: There are often signs of spiritual efficacy and verification (灵瑞征验事), which are not limited to this account.*\n\nAt two thousand days,\nThe talisman’s efficacy manifests—\nThe body enters the realm of the **Immortal Deities** (神仙),\nAnd the Divine Essence appears as a human being,\nOften seen in person.\n\nBut the spoken words (言) are only for the self;\nThe body does not often appear.\nThe **Polarity** (冲) is near to humanity.\n*Note: According to this, Laozi does not often appear in human form,\nBut is seen through the talismans of soldiers, officials, and Celestial Maidens (玉童玉女等).\nFearful that people might doubt his words,\nAnd slander him as a demon (妖), destroying the true Dao,\nHence the transmission through generations.*\n\nThus, the **Direct Transmission of the Single Mind** (正一心直) is passed down,\nEntering the **Way of Non-Action** (无为之道),\nFree from confusion and perversity (无惑无邪),\nFree from error and loss (无非无失),\nAttaining **Oneness** (得一者也).\n\nAt three thousand days,\nThe Six Jia Celestial Maidens (六甲玉女) often appear in person.\n\nAfter fourteen years,\nOne ascends to the heavens (上升天),\nEntering the **Shaking Light** (摇光),\nAnd bowing to the **Big Dipper** (北斗).\n*Note: When a person’s steps align with the Dao (步纲得道),\nThey must first ascend to the Big Dipper’s realm (北斗),\nThen enter the heavenly palaces (天宫).\nHence, the Big Dipper must welcome this person,\nAnd the phrase \"entering the Shaking Light, bowing to the Big Dipper\" (入摇光，低昂北斗) is used.*\n\nThe Big Dipper **lowers once** (北斗一为低),\nAnd the Shaking Light **welcomes below** (摇光之下迎).\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"If one wishes to tread the **Seven Stars** (步七星),\nThe Six Jia must first be perfected.\"*\n\n*Note: For humans, the soul and vital essence (魂魄) all fear the Big Dipper (北斗).\nThus, those who swallow talismans and practice the Six Jia (吞符服六甲)\nCan be reborn in humanity,\nAnd the soul and vital essence no longer fear the Big Dipper.\nHence, the Six Jia can bring rebirth in humanity (生於人),\nAnd the soul no longer fears it,\nYet still fears the Big Dipper.\nTherefore, the Sage Emperors of each generation (代代圣人)\nIntended this as a means to align with the Dao (为纲步之一),\nSo that the soul and vital essence do not fear it.*\n\nTo **subdue the Big Dipper** (伏北斗),\nUse them as **divine garments** (为之衣),\nAnd command them as if they were obedient servants (如从仆),\nRespecting them like kin (敬之如兄妹).\n\nTo tread the **Nine Steps** (步九迹),\nThe Six Jia must first be **accumulated** (先积).\n*Note: \"Accumulated\" (积) refers to the practice of swallowing talismans and cultivating (服符修行积).\nAll are functions of the Six Jia.*\n\nThe Six Jia have three ranks of **Divine Armies** (三等军),\nAnd also three ranks of **Divine Offices** (三等府院).\n*Note: The Divine Offices (府院) resemble the three ranks of armies (三军营),\nAnd there are also three ranks of offices.*\n\nThe highest rank is the **Supreme Unity Office of the Upper Element** (上元太一府),\nThe Six Jia **Divine Army** (六甲军).\n*Note: Within the Supreme Ultimate (太极),\nThis is called the Heavenly Upper (天上),\nThe Six Jia Divine Army’s encampment and office (六甲军营府).*\n\nWith three **Divine Generals** (三官将) overseeing,\nThe generals and their subordinates—Celestial Maidens and Maidens (玉童玉女)—\nAre named as recorded in *Laozi’s Secret Talismans of the Six Jia* (《老君六甲秘符箓》).\n\nThe **soldiers** (兵士) number **three million six hundred thousand** (三百六十万人众),\nTo subdue the **inverted forces of Yin-Yang and the Five Phases** (阴阳五行之逆炁).\nHence, they are stationed in the Supreme Unity Office (上太一之府),\nThe **Upper Divine Official of the True Middle** (上真中官),\nThe **Middle Divine Official of the River Source** (中镇河源),\nAnd the **Lower Divine Official of Humanity** (下镇人世),\nSo that the four seasons follow their commands without error (四时行令不失),\nAnd the Five Phases transform in accordance with their due times (五行变化得时).\n\nThe **Supreme Unity Messenger** (太一使者) commands one army,\nThe **Upper Divine Official of the Heavenly Palace** (上镇天宫),\nTo subdue demons and protect those who attain the Dao (保举得道之人).\n\nThe Supreme Unity Messenger (太一使者)\nEach year presents **three offerings** (三奏) to the **Supreme Daoist Sovereign** (太上道君)\nAnd the **Later Sage Emperor** (后圣君).\n\nThe **Heavenly Master** (天师) says:\n*\"The highest rank of Laozi’s Six Jia (上等老君六甲) is one Sovereign (一君),\nAssisting and guarding at the **Golden Threshold of the Later Sage Emperor** (太平金阙后圣玉皇上道君殿)\nOn the left staircase below (左阶下立).*\n*Note: Like the worldly sovereign (世天子),\nThey stand in the proper court assemblies (会立正朝之卿),\nWith left and right distinctions.*\n\nEach year, they hold **three great assemblies** (三大朝),\nRaising the **flags and banners of the Immortal Deities** (仙真旗仗旌节),\nCommanding the **Divine Forces of Demons** (魔威神) to restrain the hearts of ghosts (制鬼之心),\nSo that they submit to the **Daoic威** (道威),\nAnd the **Ten Heavens** (十天) are properly revered by gods, humans, and deities (天地人神),\nThe **Dragons and Ghosts** (龙鬼) subdue demons (制魔),\nAnd protect those who attain the Dao (保举有道),\nEliminating faults and transgressions (消伏愆过).\n\nWithin one year,\nThere are three assemblies of reverence and offering.\n*Note: The first assembly (上元) is on the fifteenth day of the first month (正月十五日).\nThe second assembly (中元) is on the fifteenth day of the seventh month (七月十五日).\nThe third assembly (下元) is on the fifteenth day of the tenth month (十月十五日).\nIn one year, these three days (三日)\nAre when the gods of the Ten Heavens, the Five Phases, the Six Jia (十天之内，三元五行六甲等),\nAnd the Immortal Deities’ officers and soldiers (神人真仙官兵将玉童玉女等)\nAll, one by one, follow the **Heavenly True Immortal Sovereign** (天真大仙),\nAssisting and guarding in the assemblies before the **Later Sage Emperor’s Heavenly Palace** (玉皇上道君殿前),\nTo inspect the Ten Heavens (明检十天),\nDriving and dividing left and right (驱分左右),\nMarking those with intent (点记有心),\nAnd before them, the true cultivators who have attained the Dao (前言成道之真人),\nTheir number seen in the present and future,\nAnd afterward, they inspect the living populace (后检生民).\n\nWithin the Ten Heavens,\nAll good and evil deeds and merits are reported to the Jade Emperor (玉皇).\nThe Jade Emperor then commands the **Three Officials** (三官),\nEach to subdue the wicked and evil (制伏凶恶),\nTo record the fate of life and death (令部生死),\nTo entrust the inspection of the virtuous and foolish (托受巡内贤愚),\nTo judge and classify crimes and goodness (分判罪善),\nAnd to maintain fairness and equality (允其平等),\nListing their records in the Ten Heavens (列记十天).\n\nDo not allow the **rebellious hearts** (死心) to submit to the world of life and death (屈於生死世界),\nAnd clearly entrust them to the **Divine Official of Fate** (司命).\n\nThe middle rank is the **Six Jia of the Soul’s Flight** (灵飞六甲),\nAssisting and guarding at the **Golden Threshold of the Later Sage Emperor** (太平金阙后圣君玉皇上道君殿)\nOn the right staircase below (右阶下立).\n*Note: The same as the left, in terms of timing and month.*\n\nThe lower rank is the **Yin-Yang Six Jia** (阴阳六甲),\nAssigned to human life according to the **Five Phases’ correspondences** (金木水火土),\nTo match the **life-giving and life-subduing cycles** (得人之命),\nAnd to correspond with the **auspicious and inauspicious timing** (相生相克之候),\nJudging fortune and misfortune (候吉凶) and matching accordingly (而相匹配).\n*Note: This refers to the affairs of Yin-Yang correspondence in humanity (世人夫妻水火相刑相克之事).\nIn practicing the Great Dao (行大道),\nOne naturally dissolves this cycle of subjugation (自消此相克).*\n\nThe latter two ranks of the Six Jia (右些二等六甲),\nFor those who study in the world (世学之人),\nKnowing the methods of these three ranks of the Six Jia (三等六甲之法),\nThe **Six Functions of Practice and Cultivation** (六功修服步蹑)\nMake all matters align with intent (万事应心),\nNaturally dissolving the **Yin’s rapidity in Water and Fire** (自消阴速於水火),\nAnd the **Yin’s attainment of longevity** (阴取长生),\nSwiftly accomplished through the **Nine Steps** (疾於步蹑).\n*Note: Those who speak of the Yin attaining longevity (阴取长生)\nRefer to practicing the Six Jia talismans of Laozi (服老君六甲符),\nAnd the Six Jia talismans of the Soul’s Flight (灵飞六甲符),\nAccumulating their efficacy (功着更着),\nAnd further practicing the Nine Steps to align with the Dao (步蹑天纲地纪之功着),\nSwiftly achieving the **subduing of the Nine Steps** (疾成於步摄).\n\nThus, the highest and middle ranks of practice and cultivation (上中二等修服之功),\nThe first rank’s function of matching fate and destiny (一等以命运匹配),\nMutually supporting, generating, and following (相扶相生相顺),\nEncourages humans to act virtuously (志人善行),\n*Note: The lower rank has its own distinct function,\nAs mentioned earlier in the passage regarding the Five Phases (下等别自有引，在上巷中言五行).*\n\nAnd to establish the **Way of Longevity** (立入长生).\n\nThe second rank is the **Six Jia of the Soul’s Flight, Supreme Unity Office of the Upper Element** (灵飞六甲上元正一府),\nCalled the **Six Jia Divine Army of the Soul’s Flight** (灵飞六甲军).\n\nThe **encampment and its officers** (右营营中官将),\nAre the same as those of the left office (一同左府具),」\n\n「*Note:* The **encampment and its officers**, soldiers, and ranks\nAre identical to those of the **Left Office of Laozi’s Six Jia Divine Army** (左老君六甲軍營官品人數是也).\nOnly the **Ten Pure Ones of the Jade Maiden** (玉女一旬十人直) serve directly under the **sacred ordination** (經箓).\nMoreover, within the **Six Jia Inner Talismans of Laozi** (老君內符六甲), one attends per decade (一旬一人), the Jade Maiden’s direct retinue (玉女直也).\nTwo **Decade Commanders** (旬將二人) oversee them.\n\nThe **Jade Maiden of the Six Jia Soul’s Flight** (靈飛六甲玉女)\nIs the **Ten Pure Ones** (即十人直),\nYet lacks a **Divine Commander** (神將) to serve under the sacred ordination (當直經箓).\n\nHowever, those in the world who study the **Dao** (學道之者),\nAll remain unaware of this **method of the Six Jia Left and Right Armies** (六甲左右軍之法).\nThus, their distance from the **Dao** grows (去道漸遠),\nAnd they do not know by which **gateway** (門) to enter and see the **Way** (道).\n\nThis **gateway** (門) has been known by the **ancient

(舉箓),\nTo record the **true nature of the Great Dao** (大道之性),\nSo as to enlighten future generations (以曉後生).\n\nThe **officers, commanders, soldiers** (官將兵士) are also included.\nAnd it is called the **Six Jia Soul’s Flight Right Army for Guarding the Dao** (靈飛六甲衛道右軍).\n*Note:* The **Right Army** (右軍) refers to the **Heavenly Soldiers** (天兵).\nThe **Master** (師) takes **Lord Taiyi** (太一君) as the

Perfected** of **Zhonghua**, **Zaiwang Fangping Zhang Daoling**, **Zhao Shengwang**, **Chang Sishiming**, **Li Zhongfu**, **Mao Ying**, **Xu Yufu**, and others, compiled and transmitted across generations.\n**Li Chunfeng**, the Daoist Immortal, annotated.\n\n**Supreme Lord Laozi** eternally commands the **Left and Right Armies**, recording their merits and transgressions.\n*Note:* Those whose merits reach **three thousand** may ascend to a **Daoist rank**. Those with **thirty offenses** are demoted one rank.\nThus, the **Three Officials** are perpetually ordered to report on **Jiazi days** in written petitions.\n\nAmong the **Six Jia officers, generals, and officials**, many falsely claim merits on **Jiazi days**.\nThese merits are **hidden merits** (*yīn gōng*).\nThere are **six hidden merits**:\n*Note:*\n1. Each day, **reverentially recite** before the **Celestial Worthy, Forebear Saints, the Supreme Dao Lord, the Heavenly Emperor, and the Three Sovereigns**.\n   These merits are **spoken**—when receiving the **precepts**, one must **verbally inquire** and **memorize** them from the Master’s **oral instructions**. Do not forget—this is the **first secret method**.\n   Without this method, even **hundreds of rituals** are meaningless.\n   If one does not follow the proper order, the **Heavenly Tribunals** will not record their deeds.\n   One must **receive the Master’s oral instructions** and **embody them** in both **mind and body**.\n   Upon completion, **swallow the talisman**, and the merits will be **recorded in Heaven**.\n\n   Each merit is **counted individually**, and their **reports never cease**.\n   Now, I enumerate the **hidden merits and hidden virtues**, as well as the **manifest merits and manifest virtues**, all clearly laid out.\n\n   There are **seven墨书 (*mòshū*)**—granted by the **Forebear Saint, the Supreme Emperor of the Great Dao**, to those **whose fate aligns with Dao**.\n   *Note:* The **Forebear Saint** refers to **Supreme Lord Laozi**.\n   **朱书 (*zhūshū*)** are granted by the **Later Saint, the Jade Emperor of the Supreme Dao**, to those **whose fate aligns with Truth**.\n   *Note:* When a Master transmits the **precepts**, one must **carefully test the disciple**, observing their **nature and disposition**.\n   If they possess **excessive manifest merits**, they should not be **recklessly granted** the **precepts**.\n\n   Among the **hidden merits**, there are **three**:\n   The **Forebear Saint** granted them to the **Three Sovereigns** and the **Forty-Nine True Persons**, all attaining **Daoist immortality**.\n   The first is: **After receiving the Dao**, internally cultivate with **sincere heart**, healing the **suffering of all beings**, while **personally ingesting** the remedies.\n   The second: **Six Jia officers** calculate daily merits—**prior cultivation** under **Lord Laozi’s Six Jia**, **three years of talisman ingestion**, **Dao-qi subduing the spirit**, **calming the heart-qi**, **illuminating the five viscera**, and **manifesting divine efficacy**.\n   *Note:* **\"Efficacy\"** refers to using talismans to **test and heal** others’ calamities—those who recover are said to have **divine efficacy**. **Rescuing lives and things** counts as **meritorious efficacy**, **adding to the service of the *Lingfei Six Jia* talismans**, and **calculating the years, months, and days of cultivation**—this is the **first hidden merit**.\n\n   The **Later Saint Lord** instructed the **Eastern Sea Qingtong Lord** and all **Heavenly and Earthly beings** to **align with** (*héwéi*).\n   *Note:* **\"Align with\"** refers to those who, at the time of receiving this method, **had not yet attained Daoist immortality** but **aspired to cultivate**. After receiving the precepts, they **attain Dao in ten, fifteen, fourteen, eight, or nine years**, becoming **Great True Persons**.\n   The **Later Saint Lord**, knowing their **nature and disposition**, grants them the title of **Great True Person**.\n\n   The **Great True Person** says:\n   *\"Those who sincerely seek the Great Dao must internally cultivate **hidden merits and manifest virtues**, accumulating these **merits and virtues** to become **True Persons**.*\n   *Note:* **Hidden merits and manifest virtues** are fully explained in the later annotations.\n   Those who seek **Truth** must have **nature and disposition aligned with Dao**—this is not from **past karmic causes** or **pre-planted life forces**, nor is it **merely a matter of fate**.\n   *Note:* **Past karmic causes** determine **official rank in life**, while **pre-planted** implies **some connection**, but if one speaks of **seeking Truth**, their **nature and disposition are lost**.\n   This is called **external planting of merit-fields**, benefiting **future lives**, receiving **human rebirth**, but unrelated to **attaining Dao in this life**.\n   Those who truly seek **Truth** must have **nature and disposition of a True Person**—this is **not mere speech**.\n   Now, I **delineate this method** within the *Six Jia Induction Scripture*, establishing **three grades of hidden merits** and **three grades of manifest virtues**, transmitting to those of **recognized nature**.\n   *Note:* **\"Recognized nature\"** means **knowing the Dao’s essence without delusion**, perpetually practicing **hidden virtues and hidden merits**, thus **dragons, spirits, and ghosts** fear and revere them—this is called **recognizing Truth**, succeeding as **True Persons** across generations.\n\n   **First-grade hidden merits**: Cultivation within the **Six Jia**, practicing the **Five Phases and Three Realms’ methods**.\n   *Note:* These include **talisman ingestion, sacrificial rites, petitions, and step-alignment**—each has its own **scriptures and transmitted traditions**. Though the world has these texts, none truly **record merits**.\n\n   **Second-grade hidden merits**: Within the **Seven Stars**, **treading the Earthly Measures and Heavenly Rites**, descending the **Nine Essences**, commanding the **Nine Spirits**, donning the **Seven Battles**, dispelling the **Five Toxins**, averting the **Three Calamities**, and entering the **True Realm’s methods**.\n   *Note:* Each method has its own **scriptures**; these are the **cultivation practices** detailed in the *Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl*.\n\n   **Third-grade hidden merits**: Transforming **three, five, seven, nine**—\n   *Note:* **Three** refers to the **Three Sovereigns**, **five** to the **Five Phases**, **seven** to the **Seven Stars** (Heavenly Rites and Earthly Measures), and **nine** to the **Nine True Ones**, the **Nine Ancestral Lords of the Supreme Dao Lord**.\n   Internally, it explains the **step-alignment method**, the **essential key to commanding ten thousand spirits**.\n   The **essential key to the *Yǔ-bù* (Turtle Steps)**.\n   *Note:* **Three** refers to the **Three Sovereigns**, performing the **nine-track *Yǔ-bù***.\n   **Five** refers to the **Five Phases**, using the **upper *Yǔ-bù* of the Three Fives**, or **twelve tracks**, or **fifteen tracks**—all varying the **Heavenly Rites and Earthly Measures**, primarily transmitted from **Mù Yóu’s descendants**, later refined into the *Yǔ-bù*.\n\n   These **three grades of hidden merits** are all **granted in墨书 (*mòshū*)**, originally bestowed by the **Forebear Saint** upon **Upper Swangnu, the Three Sovereigns**, **Middle Swangnu, the Yellow Emperor and Xia Yu**, and **transmitted uninterrupted across ages**.\n\n「The **Later Saint** then bestowed this upon the **Eastern Sea Blue Boy** and the **Lesser Lord**, and upon all the **Heavenly Lords and Great Truths** of every realm—this is the **Red Scripture**.\n\n   The **first-grade hidden merit** has **ten conditions**.\n   **Lao Jun** says: The **first condition of hidden merit** is that one may **cultivate and wear the Six Jia Armor**—beginning on the **Jiazi day**, ending on the **Guihai day**, and then repeating in cycles.\n   On the **Jiazi day**, whenever the **decade is complete**, upon encountering a **Jia day**, three great talismans shall appear.\n   *Note:* One is the **Jade Maiden Talisman**, one is the **Jia Straight Day Talisman**, and one is the **Jiazhou Day Officer Talisman**—all three are **swallowed whole**.\n\n   Swallow them whole.\n   Then, every day, **invoke the spirit and the decade’s lord**, the **decade’s Jade Maiden**, the **Six Ding Jade Maiden**, and the name of the deity of the **straight day**—\n   *Note:* For example, on **Jiazi day**, one invokes **Wang Wenqing**.\n   along with the **official ranks**, the **names of the talisman scribes**, and so forth.\n   One then recites the **Forebear Saint’s Supreme Lord Lao Jun’s Longevity Spell** once, before beginning the incantation:\n   *\"May your hair turn black from white, and your fallen teeth regrow.\n   The **spiritual efficacy** of the **Immortal Path** shall unfold—your mind shall open like the moon’s radiance.\n   Ten thousand spirits shall witness your comings and goings.\n   All your requests shall be granted, all your wishes fulfilled.\n   You shall **ward off a hundred demons**, **dodge the Five Armies** (of calamity).\n   Remove the record of your death, and inscribe you as **Dark Immortal**.\n   Riding the clouds, harnessing the dragon, you shall ascend to the **Celestial Court**.\n   **Swiftly, swiftly, as the command decrees!***\n   After the invocation, **wear the talisman**.\n   Count the **days, months, and years**—each talisman is worn without ceasing.\n   This is the **daily merit**; in one year of **three hundred sixty days**, the merit shall also be **three hundred sixty**.\n   Practice this merit year after year without pause, regardless of month or day—your body shall grow **unyieldingly strong**, like **gold**, impervious to all **hundred diseases**, and you shall **forever avoid decay and ruin**.\n   This is the **first-grade hidden merit**, the **supreme condition** of the **Forebear Saint’s teachings**.\n\n   The **second-grade hidden merit** is to **constantly act with compassion**, **saving people and benefiting all beings**.\n   *Note:* When a person suffers from illness or is **harmed by malevolent ghosts**, use **talismans, medicine, and techniques** to rescue them, **alleviating their disease**.\n   Let the **ghost be lightly exonerated**, and **separate the person from the ghost**, so they are no longer **bound by mutual grudges**.\n   This is called **great merit toward humans**, **great grace toward ghosts**, whereby both **achieve mutual release and separation**, free from harm—thus named the **great merit toward humans and ghosts**.\n\n   **Dissolving enmity and releasing grudges**, one must act with **the resolve to halt such deeds in darkness**.\n   Always **determine the words of the prior person** (to be saved).\n   After nightfall, **in darkness, resolve the grudge** between the person and the ghost—command them both to **retreat and repent their wrongs**, no longer plotting **vengeance or hatred**.\n   Then, **perform the Yǔ-bù (Turtle Steps)**, **specialize in the Great Mountain Isolation** to sever the **two souls and spirits**, so they no longer harbor **resentment or malice**, and their **poisonous qi** shall each disperse.\n   As the days and months pass, they shall naturally **dissipate their ill will**.\n   Such a merit is **exquisitely subtle**, the **supreme subtlety**.\n   *Note:* **Lao Jun** metaphorically describes this hidden merit—when one person knows the **Dao/Way**, they can **mediate and resolve** the **grudges and enmity of the two parties**; yet the **Dharma Master** takes the words of that person and **immediately resolves the dispute**, so that the two no longer harbor grudges—this is called **supreme merit and virtue**.\n   **Trace the Heavenly Rites Diagram**, **step upon the Earthly Measures Diagram**, and perform **three cycles**—**forward, backward, and reversed**.\n   Conclude with the words: *\"Now, there is in **State County Village** a certain **official**, or among the **common folk**, a certain **person**.\"*\n\n「Now, I invoke the **Heavenly Rites Diagram** upon the **State County Village** of the aforementioned **official** (or **common folk**),\n   and the **person** whose name is [given]—together they conspire, seeking to harm each other,\n   yet their plots are thwarted and they turn to **conspire and murder** one another.\n   I now perform the **Yin Rites** to **sever their enmity**.\n   The incantation reads: *\"Let those under this curse feel no resentment,\n   and may they each rejoice in taking turns to suffer.\n   Let mountains and seas obstruct their paths with difficulty.\n   I now turn the **Heavenly Rites Diagram**—each shall bear their due retribution.\n   Those who harbor forward intentions, may their **heart and body grow cold**,\n   and each must **suppress their heart** to find peace.\n   Violators of this decree shall have their **soul and vital essence bound to the Heavenly Punishment Diagram**.\n   The **Heavenly Punishment Diagram** is a **ritual of retribution and guilt**.\n   *(The following steps are performed:)* Twelve steps to the **Right Star**,\n   thirty-four steps to the **Heavenly Punishment Diagram**.\n   The ancient method says: *\"Two cycles—forward and backward—upon the Heavenly Rites Diagram,\n   and the deed is done.\"*\n   But now, we perform **three cycles**—forward, backward, and reversed.\n   According to the **posterity’s incantation** given by the **Saintly Sovereign** to the young disciples **Xiao-tong Jun** and **Wang Jun**:\n   *\"Two cycles—forward and backward—are complete.\n   Then, beginning from the **Sun Yang Star** at the head of the **Heavenly Rites Diagram**,\n   scatter three cycles to the right.\"*\n   When finished, **step with the left foot upon the Sun Yang Star**,\n   then **step with the right foot upon the Yin Jing Star**.\n   Again, first **step with the right foot upon the Xuan Ming Star**,\n   then **step with the left foot upon the Dan Yuan Star**.\n   Next, **step with the right foot upon the North Pole**,\n   then **step with the left foot upon the Heavenly Rites Diagram**,\n   and **step the right foot forward**, aligning with the left foot.\n   Now, **unify and bless the qi**, saying:\n\n   *\"Metal overcomes Wood, Wood is felled by Fire.\n   Water extinguishes Fire, and the **mouth of bronze** and **tongue of iron** are silenced.\n   The forward-thinking one is broken, the two hearts retreat.\n   The two tongues speak no more, both hearts are subdued.\n   They shall not slaughter each other—\n   I now summon the **Yin Forces** to constrain you two,\n   and let your **grudges and enmity** cease.\n   As it is decreed by the **Heavenly Mandate**.\"*\n\n   When the blessing concludes, **twirl the fingers of the left and right hand’s fifth digit** for a short while.\n\n   *Note:* The **finger joints** are fully annotated in the previous section.\n\n   This further states: *\"On the **right side of the third joint of the left hand’s fifth finger** is the **key incantation**.\"*\n   This method is for **practitioners** to cultivate,\n   so that those harboring **grudges and enmity** do not harm each other,\n   nor conspire against one another’s life—\n   the **self** shall act upon this.\n   Or, if one fears that the other may act upon them,\n   and they dread future **retribution and blame** upon their own body,\n   they may **pray for obstruction and separation**, so that the other never comes again.\n   *(This is done)* over **three nights**, without letting others see it.\n   If seen, the **spiritual efficacy** will not manifest.\n\n   *Note:* When a person cultivates **Yin Merits** and **Yin Virtue**,\n   if their **Yin Merits** and **Yin Virtue** are not yet fulfilled,\n   they will be exposed by a **Yang Person**—once seen,\n   a thousand tongues will stir, and it becomes a **Yin Fault**.\n   How much more so if they dare to **cultivate Yin Merits to aid others**,\n   only to be **accused by Yin Officials**?\n   If one **cultivates Yin Merits** for **protecting the state, safeguarding life, and rescuing others**,\n   they should first perform **three cycles upon the Earthly Measures Diagram**.\n   When finished, **three cycles—forward, backward, and reversed—are complete.*\"\n\nThen perform the **Flying Heavenly Ropes** three times, and upon completion, disperse with **three steps of the Nine Traces Yu Step**, striking to halt them. If fearing they will not stop, perform **twelve steps of the Yu Step** once more, then take **fifteen steps**.\n\nSummon the **Three Marshals of Upper, Middle, and Lower** realms, each commanding **three hundred million troops**, along with the **Six Jia deities**, invoking them as in the *Hunpeng Diagram* and the *Liuzhu* [scroll]’s **Three Marshals of Yuanxia and Yuanxia-inferior** diagrams. Strike three times—all matters will dissolve, and no harm will befall that person. If done **six times**, the person will fall ill; do not act recklessly, lest your **Yin Virtue** be diminished. If done **nine times**, they will perish instantly.\n*Note:* Do not act recklessly—this diminishes your **Yin Virtue**, turning it into a **Yin Fault**.\n\nThe **three grades of the Yu Step** are illustrated above in the diagrams referenced earlier. Now, with this Yu Step, you may **invoke the Mountain Barrier** to sever the enemy, following the **Array Formation Step Diagram**. Turning right once, summon the **Ninefold Mountains** to isolate their spirit and soul, so they dare not approach.\n\nThis is called the **Earthly Axis Yu Step**, invoking the **Twenty-Four Earthly Axis Deities**, opening a **one-cun** space to encompass **ten thousand li of rivers and mountains**, or **ten thousand li of rivers and mountains** condensed into a **one-cun step**. This Yu Step is subtle and profound—it can **subdue and gather** within a person’s body, allowing them to soar through the void without knowing distance.\n\nThe secret lies within the **three horizontal marks** at the base of the **left hand’s first finger**; this is the **Earth-Core Secret**. *Note:* One may also receive the teacher’s revelation of its ultimate principle, uncovering the true secret where it is exposed.\n\nAfter completing the **three cycles of the Step Ropes**, pinch the **left hand’s central secret** with the right, then stamp the ground, lifting the foot to invoke the **Earth-Core Secret** and the **Earth-Inner Secret**. Then recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Heaven is clear, Earth is level,\nThe sun and moon move in order,\nAll beings thrive in harmony,\nThe land is ruled by a virtuous sovereign.*\n\nNow, there is a certain person defying Heaven with clamor.\nI tread the Yu Ropes’ path,\never severing their way.\nThrough **thousand mountains and ten thousand chasms** they cannot pass—\nto pass is to perish, body and soul undone.\"\n\nTake **original-colored stone** and cast it—this will halt them.\nThe **original-colored stone** is found in the *Six Jia Talismans*; once seen, it is obtained.\n\nThis **Step Rope** is not merely for **Yin Merits** in saving others—if practiced daily, within **three years**, one may shorten the **Earth’s pulse**, often moving faster than flight. *Note:* In antiquity, **Master Gou** (surname **Shi**, given name **Cun**), a disciple of **Confucius**,...\n\nWith the Master Kong’s teachings,\nhe sought office repeatedly yet failed.\nThen, gazing heavenward, he sighed:\n*\"My heart still yearns—\nto seek the Supreme Dao, the Most Exalted,\nas a minister beneath the Jade Emperor’s throne,\nin the lofty halls of the Ten Thousand Clouds, the Left Palace of the Celestial Capital.\nHow much harder, then, to seek even a lowly official\nbeneath the worldly emperor’s rule—\nsuch a thing is so rare!\nThus, I abandoned Confucian texts\nand turned to the Dao, seeking a worthy teacher.*\n\n*First, I met Master Zhao of the Western Prefecture,\nand followed him as teacher, studying scriptures.\nMy voice chanted the rites of morning reverence—\nmy resolve never wavered.\nFor thirty-seven years,\nI grew ever more enveloped in murky ignorance,\nweakened by age, powerless to act.\nAgain, I sighed to Heaven:\n‘How fortunate that Heaven granted me this foolish body—\nI studied Confucianism, mastered its ways, yet gained no honor.\nI sought the Dao, my heart labored in vain, my wisdom never brightened.\nWas it not because my past virtues were meager,\nmy fate unkind?\nHow could I now grow old and die?’\n\nIn a sudden flash, I fainted and died.\nYet in death, I saw a woman of surpassing beauty,\nwho spoke to me, saying:\n‘You sought the Dao but lacked a true master.\nYou did not cultivate wisdom with iron resolve,\nnor temper your body like adamantine.\nYou toiled only over the Five-Colored Flower’s hidden teachings,\nsinging idle tunes, reciting frivolous words,\nlike a child playing with hollow syllables.\nYour path grows ever more distant from the Dao.\nIf you truly wish to attain it,\nabandon these ways and seek another path.\nGo to Mount Shaoshi,\nand find Master Jiuling—\nJiuling is the Lord Lao’s emanation.\nOr some say he is Master Wang’s disciple, the Lady of the Six Jia.’\n\n‘A mortal who cultivates meritorious deeds in secret\nmay now find the Dao complete—\nyet you must depart swiftly, not linger.’\n\nThus, Shi Cun awoke\nand journeyed to Mount Shaoshi,\nsearching for three months without success.\nYet with a pure heart, unwavering resolve,\nhe suddenly encountered an old man on the road—\nseventy or eighty years old, with snow-white hair,\nwalking like a tiger, strong enough to bear another man.\nShi Cun gazed long, recognizing him as a divine being,\nand hurried forward to bow in reverence.\nThe bystanders were astonished and asked:\n‘Why do you bow to this old man?’\nOne among them replied:\n‘When encountering a True Person, one must pay homage with haste.’\n\nThen Jiuling Master scolded:\n‘Why have you come so late?\nI wished to take you to Mount Wangwu,\nto pay respects to the Lady of the Six Jia.\nI have waited long—\nHeaven’s records have decreed\nthat I should instruct you in cultivating the Six Jia’s meritorious deeds,\nand prescribe the talismans to heal your body.\nYet you are already old—\nwhy did you not begin sooner?’\n\nShi Cun fell to the ground, kowtowing twice,\ndeclaring he had been reborn only to meet this master.\nHe begged:\n‘I humbly pray that the master teach me the art of immortality,\nso that my wretched body may endure.\nI would serve as your slave,\nregardless of years or months—\nonly grant me this life.’\n\nJiuling Master then led him into Mount Wangwu,\nand for three years,\ntaught him the method of *stepping the Celestial Halter and Earthly Measures*,\nto swallow the *Six Jia’s Soul-Soaring Scriptures*,\nand bestowed the *Twenty-Four Stages of the Earth’s Axis Talismans*,\nalways turning the Earth’s Axis and Heaven’s Gate.\nAfter fourteen years of secret cultivation,\nhis Dao was complete.\n\nHe then took a jar—\na vessel of two *sheng* capacity—\nwhich could contain the entire world beneath the Great Luo Heaven,\nwithin the Great Polarity’s embrace,\nand sealed it inside.\nOr the jar was the Six Jia’s encampment,\nand the *Scriptures of Qi-Sealing Arts* were its talismans,\nto transmit to mortals for cultivating meritorious deeds in secret.\n\nWas it not because his heart was most sincere\nthat the divine master took him as a disciple,\nand guided him to attainment?\n\nLater, he wandered the world for seven hundred years,\nuntil the Jin Dynasty, when Fei Changfang encountered him\nand learned the method of *shortening the Earth’s pulse*.\nFor three days, he hosted Fei in his jar to receive the teachings.\nUpon returning, three years passed,\nwhen one day, the Most Holy Jade Emperor of the Golden Threshold\nsent celestial maidens to welcome him,\nand he ascended to the rank of *Left Celestial Marshal*,\nakin to the worldly Grand Councilor.\n\nTruly, the Supreme Dao was fulfilled—\nhis wish to be granted the Celestial Marshal’s rank was answered.\n\n**The Third Rule of Yin Merits:**\nWhen the Dao’s power is manifest,\none observes the world—\nif malevolent spirits, poisonous dragons, or demons\nunleash raging winds and torrential rains,\nharming all beings, whether on land or sea,\none must tread the *Celestial Halter and Earthly Measures*\nthree times each, as described in the *Diagram of Stepping Heaven and Earth’s Measures*.\nDissolve into the *Yugbu Steps*—\nnine strides, twelve strides, or fifteen strides—\nand always align with the Heaven’s Gate.\nRaise the hand and point with three, six, or nine fingers.\n*Note: Some say three times—\nthe poisonous spirits will then cease,\nand no lives will be harmed.*\n\nSix strikes for illness,\nnine for imminent death—\ndo not recklessly invoke these prohibitions to kill,\nfor that is not the Dao.\n\nOne must first discern the truth—\nif harm is being wrought by malevolent spirits,\nand they act with demonic fury three or two times,\nthen all beings will be at peace,\nand only then may the *Step-Halter Method* be applied.\nThe demons will then cease.\n\nCease and release them—\ndo not kill outright.\nIf you kill, pluck the *dragon-spirit’s vital thread* from their demonic beasts—\nthe beasts will die within three days.\n\nLater, the Sage Monarch revealed the *Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl* manual,\nwhere all methods for subduing dragons and beasts are recorded.\nUse this to verify.\n\nThe Sage said:\n‘Do not act recklessly—\nthose who do will harm others’ lives,\nand bear guilt before all beings.\nIf beings are unsettled,\nor lives are lost to drought or flood,\nthe lawful method must be applied to execute judgment.\n*Note: The “Heaven’s Gate” cessation refers to the nine strikes—\nthis is the execution.*\n\nTo save one life and gain ten is called *double merit*.\nWhen three thousand are saved,\none ascends to Heaven in broad daylight.\n*Note: Regarding the wind, as recorded in the *Book of Jin* and *Strange Records of the Divine*,\nXu Xun served as the magistrate of Jingyang County,\nyet mastered the Dao of the *Yugbu Steps*.’\n\nThe Great Serpent of Shu, with three coils,\nand the Six Poisonous Dragons of the Han River,\ntogether plagued the people as *spirits of calamity*,\nblocking the river and ridges fore and aft,\nseizing humans to devour.\nWhen Heaven learned of this,\nXu Xun’s *Dao/Way* was perfected in the *Yugbu Steps*,\nand he treaded the *Yugbu Steps’* path,\nturning the *Heaven’s Gate* strike—\nhe captured and slew them.\nHe did not exceed the *nine strikes’* limit on *spirits of calamity*,\nyet saved over ten thousand lives.\n\nThis serpent appeared in a dream to the Jin Emperor:\n*\"I now consume the people of Jianghuai—fifteen hundred thousand.\"*\n\nThe Jin Emperor was greatly alarmed.\nWithin two years,\nXu Xun alone received the *irresistible execution* decree,\nand was posthumously honored as a *rightfully appointed* magistrate.\nHe declined the title, refusing to accept it.\n\nThe *Earthly Tribunals* reported to the *Heavenly Court*,\nthe *Heavenly Court* to the *Celestial Sovereign*,\nthe *Golden Threshold of Great Peace* to the *Jade Sovereign of the Later Saints*,\nwho dispatched an envoy to welcome Xu Xun.\nHe was granted *ascension in broad daylight*,\nand his household was lifted from their homes to depart this world.\n\nThus, his killing was without blame,\nand he earned *hidden merit*.\nAgain, if there are *refined spirits* or *malevolent spirits of calamity*\nplaguing people,\nbinding them across generations without release,\nor if they are *yin-precise* malevolent spirits,\ncausing illness and death among the populace,\nunrest in homes,\nand widespread suffering,\nwith no end in sight—\nthis follows the *符命* (divine mandate) of the *Supreme Venerable Lord Lao*,\nusing the *符* (talisman) to heal diseases,\nand the afflicted recover.\n\nTurning the *Heaven’s Gate* strike—\nthe *nine degrees* of the *irresistible execution*,\nand saving those on duty for the *Six Jia* (days) and their corresponding *directing officials*,\nas well as the *attendant officials*, *talisman scribes*, etc.—\nurgently summon and compel them.\n\nThus, the healing talismans can transform into *spirits* or *officials*,\nbeheading those malevolent spirits,\nand the illness is immediately cured.\nSuch deeds are *most exalted* in Heaven,\nand the *Jade Sovereign* rejoices from afar.\nKeep this secret—do not use it recklessly.\n\n**Right: The Three *Yin-Functions* of the Six Jia.**\nThe remaining seven are in the Fourteenth Volume.\n\n---\n*End of the Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl Manual, Volume Seventeen.*\n*Begin the Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl Manual, Volume Eighteen.*\n\n**Fourth Condition of the Six Jia Yin-Functions**\n\nThe Most High Lord of the Dao, the Sovereign of the Great Perfection, Zhai Wang Fangping, Zhang Daoling, Zhao Shengwang, the Long Official Li Zhongfu, Mao Ying, Xu Yufu, and others, compiled this in succession.\nThe Daoist Master Li Chunfeng annotated it.\n\nThe Lord Lao said:\n*\"Those who study the Dao and cultivate in the world—when their Daoist practices are refined and their talismanic power is perfected—\nsuddenly, if commoners or officials fall ill with epidemic pestilence, miasma-induced sickness, or contagious disease, causing death or injury among the afflicted,\none may pinch the *pestilence spirit’s eye*,\ntake nine *Yujia steps* in three strides,\nalign with the *Heaven’s Gate*,\nand point toward the sick person’s dwelling in a certain direction—\nthree times.\nThen, one may issue the talisman,\nsaving each afflicted person instantly.*\n\n*If a household of ten has three, four, or five stricken, near death,\nthey may swallow the talisman and recover immediately.*\n\n*Those not yet sick may wear one talisman,\nensuring none in the household contract the illness—\nthe sick recover, the healthy remain untainted.\nA household of ten earns ten merits;\na household of twenty, twenty merits.\nThis is the supreme Yin-Function of the talismanic method.*\n\n*Keep this secret—do not recklessly transmit it to the unworthy.*\n\n*This is the tenth condition of merit.\nIts efficacy is verified,\nand the Later Sage Emperor bestowed this chapter\nupon the Six Jia and their consorts.\nThe chapter is in *The Flowing Pearl: Upper Section*.*\n\n*The Later Sage Emperor instructed the Heavenly Master Zhang Daoling:\n‘Among the Six Jia, the tenth condition of merit—\nthe talisman that exorcises pestilence spirits and saves lives—\nis of great power.\nYou and your disciples must observe the world:\nif any are afflicted, treat them urgently.\nThe people fear this sickness greatly,\nyet few can cure it.\nWhen they see their lives saved, they will rejoice,\npraising the marvelous efficacy—\nworthy of Heaven’s hearing.\nAll sins of bodily obstruction shall be erased.\nGuard this treasure carefully—do not reveal it to the unworthy.*\n\n*Before Master Zhang Daoling practiced this method,\nwhen Chinese people sought treatment from foreign masters,\nthose who went perished with their entire households—\nnot even minor exorcisms could save them.*\n\n*Note: In the past, a third-generation foreign master entered China\nand attempted to exorcise this spirit.\nThe spirit resisted,\nand its qi struck him down.\nThis is fully recorded in *The Flowing Pearl: Middle Section*—\nno need to repeat it here.*\n\n*The pestilence spirit’s *eye* is located on the left hand’s fourth finger, third joint.\nTo the right of the joint, near the fingernail,\nlies the *pestilence spirit’s blade*—\nif struck, the spirit dies within three days.\nThis is highly verified.*\n\n*In antiquity, Zuo Ci, styled Yuanfang, of Jiangdong,\nwas skilled in restraining spirits.\nWhen Wei Wen Di heard of him, he commanded the exorcism of pestilence spirits.\nThe spirits, weeping, said to one another:\n‘The Jiangdong Master Zuo will pinch our eyes with copper claws—\nwe must leave.\nIf we do not, he will strike us with his blade—\nwe will die immediately.’\nThey wept and departed together.\nWithin three days, all illnesses in the palace vanished,\nthe healthy remained untainted,\nand none contracted the sickness.*\n\n*The Most High Lord Lao bestowed the *Eight Barbarian Scriptures*,\nwhich contain talismanic officials to subdue spirits.\nPreserve them as in the diagram—\nthe pestilence spirits will flee.\nIf they do not flee, they will die.\nThis is highly verified.\"*\n\nThe fifth *yin* virtue: The Most High Lord Lao said: *\"Those who cultivate the Dao with a focused mind must take compassion as their foundation, rescuing and delivering all beings as their primary purpose, and subduing evil while establishing the rectified qi as their intent. If there is evil, the rectified qi cannot flow or descend. If one can employ talismans and medicines to treat malevolent spirits without harming the rectified, then even those whose hearts are steeped in evil may be given one or two talismans to swallow and purify them. For those afflicted with chronic evil illnesses—lingering, dim-witted, and enfeebled for ten or five years—these are the spirits of old *lao* (precocious) ghosts and demons, fox, weasel, or rat *jing* (essence-spirits). They may be pursued and beheaded with talismans without hesitation. Saving one person earns one virtue; exterminating a spirit earns two virtues.\n\nThe method for extermination involves reciting the *Di Ji* (Earth Memorization) once and the *Fei Tian Gang* (Flying Heaven Rope) once. Then, perform the *Yu Bu* (Flood Step) nine times, align with the *Pei Yi* (Configuring Garment) of the Seven Stars, turn the *Tian Guan* (Heavenly Lock), and point toward a specific village or household in a certain place. With three six nines (27) finger-pointings, summon the Six Generals of the Middle and Lower *Yuan* (Origins) to that person’s residence, commanding them to unleash water and fire, leading three hundred million troops as depicted in the diagram. If the Three Generals of the Middle *Yuan* are invoked from the *Liu Zhu Zhong Wai Pian* (Flowing Pearl Inner and Outer Chapters), they will arrive at the door to capture and exterminate the ghost, circling the residence with a great shout. Often, after three such invocations, the spirit will die, and the illness will abate. This *yin* virtue is also great, and the world will revere it.*\n\nThe sixth *yin* virtue: When a practitioner’s cultivation is complete, they may sit and rescue those thousands of miles away. With a talisman, they can save people in battle, binding it to a person’s body to ward off blades and swords, preventing harm. On a *Liu Jia* (Six Jia) day, one may invoke the *Liu Jia* deities, take three steps of the *Yu Bu* (nine traces), align with the *Pei Yi*, and point three times with the hand. This grants the *Xing Jun Huo Fu* (Marching Army Fire Talisman) and the *Dai Jue* (Bound Avoidance), ensuring the wearer will never be harmed by bandits. If a great general seeks to annihilate enemy forces for the state, they may be given the *Wan Sheng Shen Fu* (Ten-Thousand Victory Divine Talisman) to bind, rendering blades and swords powerless to harm.\n\nFor those commanding armies to strengthen the state, one may recite the *Di Ji* nine times, the *Fei Tian Gang* three times, disperse the *Yu Bu* in nine traces three times, twelve traces three times, and fifteen traces three times. Then align with the *Pei Yi*, turn the *Tian Guan*, and point toward the enemy’s direction nine times, pinching the *dao zhi* (claw support) of the person in that direction.\n*Note: If the enemy is in the East (Wood), use the Wood-person *dao zhi*; West (Metal), Metal-person *dao zhi*; South (Fire), Fire-person *dao zhi*; North (Water), Water-person *dao zhi*; Seasons (Earth), Earth-person *dao zhi*. Alternatively, one may also correspond with the Five Phases (Metal, Water, Wood, Fire, Earth) as needed.*\n\nThese two methods are the same. Additionally, sprinkle water in accordance with the direction, and the enemy will self-destruct. This method must be kept secret and not used recklessly. The ancient sage-kings revealed this method to save those who cultivate the Dao, aiding them in times of difficulty and assisting Daoist states in peril. It must not be used lightly—without proper mandate, even a moment’s misuse is forbidden.\n\nThe ancient sage-kings further instructed: *\"Realgar of a red hue—write the two *Da Jie* (Great Calamity) talismans, which are detailed in the *Li Fa* (Ritual Method). Also write the *Ru Jun Fu* (Entering Army Talisman) and the six *Liu Jia Yin Fu* (Six Jia Yin Talismans), binding them to the soldiers. In battle, they will suffer no injury for every ten thousand. These talismans are found in the *Liu Zhu Zhong Wai Pian* military methods.\"*\n\nThe seventh *yin* virtue: If the heavens endure prolonged rain without ceasing, and floods devastate the people—drowning villages, towns, and individuals—one may, in secret at night, recite the *Di Ji* three times and the *Fei Tian Gang* three times. Then disperse into the *Yu Bu* of nine traces, reaching twelve and fifteen traces, align with the *Pei Yi*, turn the *Tian Guan*, and point three times toward the darkest clouds. After three repetitions, issue a talisman to the local shrine, stipulating a specific day and hour for the rain to cease. If it does, pinch the *Long Mu* (Dragon’s Eye).\n*Note: The eye is on the left side of the second joint of the left hand’s index finger, near the claw nail. Pinch it urgently.*\n\nThe eighth *yin* virtue: If the heavens withhold rain for too long, caused by the *Kang Long* (Proud Dragon), and crops wither and die—unless this drought is a heavenly decree—\n*Note: If the drought is a heavenly command, do not act recklessly, lest you harm the Dragon’s mandate. The heavens punish the Dragon, and retribution follows naturally.*\n\nIf the drought is caused by the *Tu Di Long Shen* (Earthly Land Dragon Spirit) refusing to rain, one may, at night in an unoccupied courtyard, recite the *Di Ji* and *Fei Tian Gang* each three times, disperse into the *Yu Bu* of three steps and nine traces three times, align with the *Pei Yi*, turn the *Tian Guan*, and point three times toward a deep pool.\n*Note: The pool must contain dragons or water deities, the officials of the Water Palace, to ensure immediate efficacy and swift rain as urgent as fire.*\n\nAt dawn, write the *Zhi Ri Fu* (Direct Day Talisman) and the *Jiu Long Shui Fu* (Nine Dragons Water Talisman), affixing them to the local shrine and land gods.\n*Note: In ancient times, there were no *Cheng Huang* (City Gods); today, one must first invoke the City God officials and the land boundary shrine and water palace spirit officials, along with the Direct Day deity, to assemble the assembly and command the rain to fall at the appointed time. Urgently, as the law decrees. The deities will swiftly cause the rain to fall within the stipulated days, nourishing all rivers and streams, fulfilling the oath of hand and mouth.*\n\nThe Most High Lord Lao said: *\"I have transmitted this method to the world, so that those who cultivate the Dao may save others and achieve great merit. Those who save all under heaven will attain peace and joy beyond measure. This virtue is unfathomable, and those who uphold it will ascend the ranks of the immortals. This eighth virtue is what all sages and true ones have long kept in mind for those who earnestly study. Mastering this method and accumulating merit leads directly to the Dao.\n\nThe later sage-kings further transmitted the three *Long Fu* (Dragon Talismans), including the second method of the *Liu Jia Lu* (Six Jia Scriptures) and the talisman of the *Zhi Ri Shen* (Direct Day Deity).\"*\n\n「Annotation: Within the *Six Jia Scriptures*, the method is selected as follows: One talisman is used to summon the Dragon Talismans, in accordance with the law, swiftly as water and fire. The Dragon Talisman is invoked by the *Long Jue* (Dragon Decision), located on the left hand’s second finger at its first joint.\n\nThe Most High Lord Lao said: *\"Those who earnestly cultivate the Dao and seek verification must first understand this method of employing the Way to subdue dragons and enslave ghosts. Those who fail to grasp it will drift ever farther from the Dao, and must not presume to practice it. This method aids and assists the human body. I observe that in the present age, those who study the Dao merely take sound and image as the Dao.\n\nAnnotation: The wind carries the teachings of the ancient *Wu Wei* (Non-Action) Dao; now, they have entered the realm of *You Wei* (Action).\n\nNowadays, when people hear the Dao’s teachings, their ears and eyes are filled with devotion, and when they see its symbols, their hearts and spirits rise in faith. Though they may briefly awaken to goodness, their actions do not align with the Dao’s source, nor with the Dao itself. They merely labor at constructing mountains of merit that span the skies, only to exhaust themselves in vain and dissipate their efforts. Thus, the truly wise do not take sound and image as their instruction.\n\nThis is the hollow merit of the petty-minded, who vainly practice in the world. To recognize one’s true nature as *virtue* (德),—\n\nAnnotation: Lord Lao’s words here instruct the students, stating that in the present age, people mistake the forced cultivation of knowledge and true nature as the heart of *You Wei* (Action) virtue, rather than the natural virtue of *Wu Wei* (Non-Action). Throughout their lives, they exhaust themselves in futile, arduous striving. Such people, though the world may count them by the ten-thousand, will not achieve a single success. I often lament this, hence I have left ten conditions of hidden merit, and this is the foremost.\n\nIn the time of the ancient sage-king Shun, there was a drought lasting one hundred days. The emperor commanded his ministers to pray for rain. After fifty days, the sun’s midday heat scorched people with thirst and want, and many died—spread across all nine regions, with mountains blazing, grasses withering, and stones glowing like embers, making it unbearable for people to stand. Suddenly, two immortals arrived, and one sighed: *\"What kind of people are these, finding joy in such agonizing heat? Why?\"*\n\nThe other replied: *\"Let us pray for rain to descend.\"*\n\nThe immortal said: *\"Rain is the dragon’s movement; why should it concern your prayers?\"*\n\nThe official answered: *\"We pray that the dragon descends and moves to bring rain.\"*\n\nThe immortal asked: *\"Do you recognize the dragon?\"*\n\nThe official said: *\"I recognize it.\"*\n\nThe immortal then said: *\"Since you recognize the dragon, where is it? Why do you pray for its rain?\"*\n\nAt this, the officials knelt in unison, asking the immortal to indicate the dragon’s whereabouts. The immortal suddenly pointed at one man’s foot, and the dragon moved with tiger-like strides—\n\nAnnotation: The act of pointing with the hand is the turning of the Celestial Gate.\n\nThe man’s foot became the dragon’s and tiger’s steps, resembling the *Wu Bu* (Avoiding Steps) of today. After three strides, the immortal shouted: *\"Why does the dragon not move to bring rain?\"*\n\nAt that moment, the dragon bowed and said: *\"The Celestial Sovereign forbids rain for one hundred and eighty days. I have already twice secretly brought rain to save people, but both times I was summoned by the Underworld to report. This time, I dare not move, for if I do, I will be summoned, and my transgression will be heard by the Supreme Deity. The Celestial Talisman will descend to punish my body as a dragon.\"*\n\nThe immortal immediately sought paper and brush, writing a Celestial Talisman decree. He affixed it to the shrine deities and the dragon, commanding them to bring rain together. At that time, the shrine deities and the dragon, having received the decree, brought rain as ordered, and the limit was fulfilled within one day.\n\nAnnotation: Though the limit was fulfilled within one day, this method is too harsh. The dragon and deities, in their urgency to bring rain, must use violent winds and torrential downpours, uprooting trees. The immortal’s original intent was to secretly bring rain, but fearing that the Celestial Sovereign might forbid it and assign all the blame to the dragon, he ordered the storm to be swift. If the Celestial Sovereign did not punish the dragon, it would be spared. If he did punish it, the immortal feared damage to the dragon. At that time, the dragon was not punished, which was due to the immortal’s compassion, saving all beings in the world. Thus, the Celestial Sovereign did not blame the dragon. Instead, he rewarded the shrine deities, the dragon deities, and the eight departments of the river and sea spirits, granting them promotions. From then on, all of them thanked the immortal one by one.\n\nNow, if one obtains this method, the rain limit is set within three to five days, and this is already considered a great merit. Both the deities and the people rejoice, and according to the limit, the rain will be fulfilled, and promotions will follow. The merit’s efficacy lies with the Daoist master, who assesses the merit and may bestow rewards of wine and music.\n\nLater, there are three *Hui* (Assembly) days, where separate offerings are made to declare the merit’s efficacy.\n\nAnnotation: There is a method that does not require offerings; one simply submits the merit declaration and petition. This is not permissible. The three Assembly days are the days of the grand *Jiao* (Offering), when one must set up generals, officials, and soldiers, as if the world’s emperor commands his vassals and ministers, overseeing the three armies in a similar manner. Each year, these rites must be performed in spring and winter; failure to do so violates the imperial command. This is the *San Yuan Lu* (Three Primordial Scriptures), which takes the Three Primordial days for the offering, along with one petition and merit declaration. It is not necessary to submit all petitions and documents, lest they trouble the Supreme Deity and Lord of the Dao.\n\nThe ninth condition of hidden merit: The Most High Lord Lao instructed the male *Zhen Ren* (True Persons) like *Zhen Wang* (True King) Fang Ping and Han Fei Zheng, and the female *Zhen Ren* like Li the Lady, Wang the Lady, and the Lady of *Zi Wei* (Purple Micro), among the seventy-two great *Zhen Ren*, saying: *\"In the world, those who earnestly cultivate hidden merit must strive for the greatest deeds—none surpass saving people and aiding the poor, nor honoring the spirits of the dead and repairing tombs.\n\nAnnotation: The honoring of tombs refers to the ancient Yellow Emperor, who during his inspection of Mount Tai encountered a buried corpse whose coffin had been washed away by water, causing the earth to collapse and expose thousands of skeletal remains. The emperor, moved by the suffering of the common people, had them all collected and placed between four large boards, with the space taken from an uninhabited highland and buried in a deep pit. He then built a mound of earth three feet high, naming it a *fen* (tomb). After this, people followed the Yellow Emperor’s example. This burial method involved four large boards, isolating the four sides of the earth, and one large board placed above as a cover—this was the method of constructing tombs. Even to this day, people use coffins as boards and *guo* (outer coffins), adding new embellishments and calling them *mu* (graves).\n\nIn his dreams, the emperor saw over a thousand people come to thank him, saying: *\"Your Majesty governs the living with the Dao and the dead with virtue. Now, we, your subjects—over a thousand seven hundred in number—have been granted your celestial mercy. You provided shelter for our exposed bones, and we have already yesterday petitioned the Celestial Bureau, stating that we were blessed by your Majesty’s mercy in relocating and burying our remains. The Bureau has rewarded your Majesty’s deeds with double merit.\"*」\n\nFrom this point onward, forty-five years passed, and the sun ascended into the clouds of heaven by day—he was indeed to become a supreme true immortal. Later, as foretold, he attained divine communion.\n\n**Annotation:** *Huangdi’s Original Chapter* records the method of erecting tombs and burying the dead to teach the world. When people learned this, their merit spread across the world, delighting gods and ghosts. After death, some with strong and wise spirits became celestial deities, earth deities, deities of the soil, or deities of grain, while the weaker became ghosts. Among ghosts, there were three ranks: superior, middle, and inferior.\n\nThe superior ghosts bestow blessings upon the virtuous and repay human kindness. The middle ghosts neither bless nor harm. These two ranks, if they attain rebirth early, are called *shan gui* (benevolent ghosts) in the retribution of human and heavenly realms. The Most High cherished them, forbidding those who received Daoist precepts from harming them, lest they lose the path to heavenly rebirth.\n\nThe inferior ghosts, however, constantly bring calamity, misfortune, and disease to the world. The Most High and the Sage Lords were enraged and often commanded Daoists to subdue and exterminate them with spells. Once subjected to Daoist judgment, their spirits were bound to the Northern Emperor’s dark and desolate peaks, imprisoned for years without resolution. Even if released, they could not be reborn as humans. Only those judged by the *Huai Tian* (Mars) were condemned to be reborn as venomous creatures—centipedes, scorpions, and snakes—dying a hundred times before being reborn once, never again as humans.\n\nWhen the human realm rejoiced, the hundred rivers and spiritual beasts presented auspicious diagrams, while the four seas’ dragons offered pearls and jade—was this not the virtue and divine communion of the Emperor’s hidden deeds?\n\nAgain, the Celestial Worthy instructed the ascetic practitioners of bitter austerity, such as Guo Jinqing, saying: *\"Your austerities save others, none greater than sowing merit. Its fruits will benefit future generations. I grant you treasures and firewood when you are in need—such deeds are vast and verifiable, leading to the Dao.\"*\n\nMoreover, he taught the forging of copper and iron into counterfeit gold and silver, taking only half the price—**Annotation:** *Half the price* means that genuine gold is worth ten *guan* per *liang* (ounce), but since counterfeit gold is made of copper or iron, one *liang* could be sold for half its value, yielding 2,500 in profit per *liang*. Yet even this, the Sage Lords permitted only for the practitioner’s own sustenance—clothing, food, and household needs—and forbade reckless excess. This method was taught by the Sage Lords of old and new to those on the Daoist path, allowing them to provide for themselves and their families.\n\nMoreover, they also used cloth and silk to make garments, feigning lost clothing along the way to give alms to the poor and the sick, thereby seeking the hidden virtue of *yin-de* (meritorious deeds unseen by others). In the past, several *zhenren* (perfected ones) practiced such deeds. This provided for their own families while also rescuing the poor and the sick—another great merit.\n\nOne must not deceive the world by falsely claiming such actions as true gold, nor should one exploit the faithful by inflating the value of treasures and rare artifacts to mislead honest people. Such crimes are grave and cannot be redeemed by seeking hidden merit. **Beware.**\n\n**Annotation:** In the past, *Yin Changsheng* (a Daoist adept) would feign lost money to aid the destitute, thereby earning hidden merit through such deeds. Today, some falsely claim this Daoist method, deceiving common folk by saying, *\"This forged gold, when refined, becomes an elixir—unmatched in the world, worthy of immortals’ alchemy.\"* Yet how could immortals engage in such worldly deceit?\n\nFurthermore, immortals all practice methods of lightening the body, allowing them to transcend physical form at will. They consume elixirs of metals and minerals to achieve levitation—such claims are utterly baseless.\n\n**The Tenth Principle of *Yin-Function* (Hidden Merit):**\nA discourse on how *zhenren* (perfected ones) and their disciples practice hidden merit and its virtues.\n\n---\n*End of the Eighteenth Section: \"The Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl Introduction\"*\n\n「The **Grand Daoist Sage** of the **Central Realm**, **Zaiwang** of the **Great Perfection**, **Zhang Daoling**, **Zhao Sheng**, **Wang Chang** (the **Master of Command**), **Li Zhongfu**, **Mao Ying**, **Xu Yufu**, and others, were all later disciples who compiled and expounded upon the teachings. The **Daoist Sage** **Li Chunfeng** annotated them. Below, the **Six Jia** (注: *Six Jia* refers to the six celestial stems, 甲,乙,丙,丁,戊,己, symbolizing a cycle of Daoist practices) **Yin-Function** (Hidden Merit) is discussed.\n\n**Old Lord** (注: *Old Lord*, 老君, refers to **Laozi**, the revered Daoist sage and patriarch) instructed **Donglai Zi** (注: *Donglai Zi*, 東來子, is **Yu the Great’s** son):\n\n*\"Donglai Zi, you learned the Dao but did not practice **Yin-Function** (Hidden Merit), only **Yang-Function** (Manifest Virtue). Your craftsmanship was clever and refined—you built a tower in an empty wilderness, carving images of Daoist figures upon it, intending this as your lifelong virtue. You sought to rely on these merits to attain the Dao and transcendence. You claim that I have crafted over ten thousand merits for you, sufficient to make you a **Great Sage** (大仙).\n\nOne day, suddenly, two **Ming Officials** (注: *Ming Officials*, 二冥使, are underworld judges or messengers) summoned you to the **Gate of Tai Mountain** (太山門下), questioning why you constructed the tower, slaughtered living beings, and sacrificed them to spirits and ghosts in the rivers and wilds—countless oxen, pigs, sheep, donkeys, and other beasts. They said to you: *'Confess your crimes, or we shall bind your body and interrogate you further.'*\n\nYou replied: *'I submit to my transgressions and accept the blame for others.'* Then, I pardoned your offense.\n\nBut if you had not submitted, you would have been bound and punished. Your father had merit for managing the waters, now you are a **Tai Ji Perfected One** (太極真人), and cannot be cursed to bear the sin of killing. I shall reduce your father’s blessings to atone for your salvation, allowing you to return to the mortal world. If you now practice **Yin-Function** (Hidden Merit) to an extent surpassing others’ lifespans, you shall attain **perfected humanity** (成人), and for countless kalpas and lifetimes, you will no longer be sought by the underworld for retribution.\n\n**Donglai Zi** responded: *'I submit.'*\n\nUpon completion, the **Ming Official** truly consulted with **Tai Mountain Lord** (太山君), who released you from death, and you revived after seven days.\n\nAfterward, you always acted with sincerity, never harming living beings. You frequently used your own wealth to redeem the lives of the deceased, liberating them without limit. You often did this.\n\nOr, when people were imprisoned and bound, you would joyfully release them. Or, you would give food and clothing to those in jail.\n\nFor thirty years, those you had previously killed—oxen, sheep, pigs, donkeys, horses, and other livestock—all took rebirth as humans, forever free of resentment.\n\nBecause of these minor merits, you were favored by **Tai Shang Laozi** (太上老君), who revealed the **true teachings of Yin-Function** (Hidden Merit) to you, instructing you in the **steps of the Dao’s celestial principles** (天地纲纪之法) and granting you the **Six Jia merits** (六甲之功).\n\nOne day, suddenly, your **divine influence** (通神威) resonated with the heavens and earth, startling both mortals and immortals. **Old Lord** descended again, bestowing upon you the **Great Yin-Function** (大阴功).\n\nYou said: *'I have always been fond of constructing towers and altars, killing living beings to sacrifice to spirits and ghosts, intending this as a means to refine my body and seek the Dao.'*\n\n*(As recounted earlier.)*\n\nNow that the **Ming Officials** have informed you, you must reflect and repent. I shall now properly instruct you in **Yin-Function** (Hidden Merit). There are ten merits:\n\n1. **Wearing the Six Jia True Talisman** (服六甲真符) to heal bodily ailments.\n2. **True-heartedness** (真心), not causing harm or injury, not killing or wounding, not acting deceitfully or lustfully. *(注: Even if you have wives and concubines, do not arbitrarily change or defile others.)*\n3. **Avoiding falsehood, flattery, and theft**, abandoning the nine levels of evil and cultivating the nine levels of good.\n   - *One: Benevolence (慈),*\n   - *Two: Filial piety (孝),*\n   - *Three: Reverence in heart (心有敬),*\n   - *Four: Dignity in form (身有礼),*\n   - *Five: Practicing virtue (行仁德),*\n   - *Six: Sparing speech (少言语),*\n   - *Seven: Not acting before others (不为人之先).*\n     - *Even if you are greater than others, you must yield and let them act first, so as not to diminish your own virtue (德).*\n   - *Eight: Not harming spirits and ghosts unjustly (不妄害鬼神),*\n   - *Nine: Always cherishing the Dao (常怀学道).*\n4. **After attaining the Dao**, saving all beings.\n\n*(注: **Yan Qing** (昔嚴清) once reduced the weight of charcoal by three or four coins per measure when selling it to the poor, or gave one or two measures to those in need. For over thirty years, one day a **Jade Maiden** (玉女) descended to bestow ten volumes of talismans and scriptures, beginning with the **Six Jia**. She commanded **Yan Qing** to kneel and receive them, explaining each one and teaching him to cultivate the **Six Jia Talismans**. **Yan Qing** replied: *'I do not understand scriptures.'* The **Jade Maiden** said: *'You already understand the nine levels of Yin-Function (Hidden Merit), so why not study and learn to recognize the characters? Once you grasp the scriptures, you will succeed.'*\n\nThus, **Yan Qing** began reading history books. Though he did not recognize the characters, the **Jade Maiden** taught him. Unable to write, she taught him calligraphy. In three years, he mastered the scriptures, filling his mind with knowledge, and none could question him—he was a sage. He frequently practiced the merit of healing the people’s illnesses and passed this on to his disciples, who all took healing as their practice. At the time, it was called **Yan Jun’s Dao** (嚴君之道).\n\nLater, the **Holy Sage** (聖君) informed the **Heavenly Master** (天師):\n\n*'You instruct your disciples in practicing Yin-Function (Hidden Merit), which has two essentials:*\n   - *(注: One, the teacher must discern the disciple’s sincerity; two, the disciple must be filial to the teacher.)*\n   - *One: The teacher must first discern the disciple—whether they have sincerity or not, faith or not. *(注: In this age, many disciples have empty words but no sincerity. Such people must not be lightly trusted to pass on teachings.)* You must weigh their sincerity carefully; do not hastily judge them. If you judge them accurately, the teacher will not err, and you may then impart a minor stage of the Dao’s methods. If the disciple has a resolute heart and delights in the Dao, day and night thinking of the Dao and rejoicing in its truth, earnestly offering supplies, the teacher will measure their deeds according to the scriptures, reducing their faults to guide them in practicing Yin-Function (Hidden Merit).*\n   - *Two: The disciple must always know the teacher’s sincerity is true and upright, secretly invoking the Dao to honor the teacher. The teacher, in turn, will be moved and often reveal themselves to the disciple. The disciple will call upon the teacher, and the teacher will respond in their heart and mind, fulfilling all their deeds—except for the three rebellions. *(注: One, not rebelling against the sovereign’s words; two, not rebelling against the father’s instructions; three, not rebelling against the teacher’s guidance.)* These three prohibitions are the **Heavenly Master’s** instructions to **Wang Chang** and **Zhao Sheng**, passed on to disciples.*\n\n*Again, the **Heavenly Master** said: 'He who secretly guides others to attain the Dao’s highest truths and honors, is said to have a **heart of benevolent enlightenment** (心願啓善利人), known as **Yin-Function** (Hidden Merit), and as **practicing Yin-Virtue** (行阴德). The heavens reward such deeds, and their descendants will inherit this virtue through generations, never ceasing to hold official positions. *(注: If you guide others in good deeds—such as healing illnesses, delivering them from calamities and misfortunes—always act with sincerity, never committing evil, and frequently practice benevolence to save the nation and people, then your merits will be fulfilled, and you will ascend to immortality in broad daylight.)*'*\n\nIf one secretly guides others toward evil, harming people and things, even if they guide them to the Dao’s highest truths and honors, it will never truly prevail. If they secretly guide others to act harmfully, damaging people and things, this is called **Yin-Plotting**, and is known as **practicing Yin-Treason** (行阴贼). The heavens abhor such deeds, and their descendants will surely suffer early deaths. *(Note: Even if descendants do not perish, they will still suffer illness, holding no office nor rank, and will be commoners.)*\n\nI now pass this teaching to you again, knowing you must act as a substitute teacher and instruct future generations. Do not harbor evil intentions—always speak with benevolence. *(Note: Benevolent speech is the voice of teaching; benevolent intentions are the heart’s practice.)* Benevolent intentions are supreme.\n\nThe **Celestial Master** told the **True Lord of the Northern Dipper**: \"When people secretly guide others, *(Note: guiding with benevolent speech and intentions, wishing to remove demons, evil spirits, and calamities of speech and illness—names unknown to mortals—one may secretly guide them, reciting softly and quietly so as not to be heard by outsiders. If heard, they may be spoken of by one person and spread by a hundred. It must not be heard, lest the Heavenly Tribunals remain unaware, and human rumors falsely transmit it as grievance. The spirits and gods know, fearing that in the clouds or at the Heavenly Gate’s three barriers, they may be intercepted by powerful spirits and gods. The Heavenly Gate’s petitions will not be permitted to reach the **Supreme Sovereign’s** presence, and the decree will descend to the Heavenly Tribunals.)* You must urgently petition the Heavenly Gate and address the **Jade Emperor**. If you wait for both the **Yin** and **Yang** talismans to arrive, you will be accused of grievance, and the **Yin Officials** and **Earthly Tribunals** will intercept you, preventing your petition from reaching the **Supreme Sovereign’s** presence. You must not wait for the **Yin** and **Yang** talismans. *(Note: Talismans are also called **Shi**.)*\n\nWhen people use proper petitions, idle memorials, and Heavenly Gate petitions, their tone, rhythm, and resonant speech are meant to be known by others. They then gather the **Earthly Tribunals’** and **Legal Talisman** armies, dispatching the **Yin-Yang Gods** of the **Six Jia** with two **Direct Talismans**, first petitioning the **Lord of the Northern Dipper**, who then relays it to the **Heavenly Gate’s** petitioner, only then reaching the **Celestial Master**. The **Celestial Master** is called **Release Teacher** in the **Laozi’s** poem, which the Buddha refers to as **Indra**. The later sage’s title is **Celestial Master**, surnamed **Zhang**, named **Ling**. After the **Celestial Master’s** decree is issued, it is directly conveyed to the **Supreme Sovereign’s** presence. Beware of the **Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water** falsely petitioning before the **Supreme Sovereign**, claiming: ‘So-and-so’s memorial contains falsehoods against the **Supreme Sovereign’s** boundless Dao.’ The **Supreme Sovereign, Laozi**, and the **Jade Emperor, the Way-Bearing Sovereign**, will not permit such petitions to pass. Be cautious. This is why the **Yin-Petition** to the **Heavenly Gate** exists.\n\nThe **Celestial Master** told the **True Person of Marvelous Conduct** *(Note: There are eight **Marvelous Conduct** figures; the true **Marvelous Conduct** bears the surname **Zhen**, named **Dingguang**):* \"When people study and understand the **Ten Grades of Yin-Function** and apply them to others, they will long endure in this practice. Within five or six years, they will attain **Divine Communication** and **Transcendence**. After achieving **Divine Communication**, they must only act benevolently to save others. As people accumulate their kindness, they will gradually be heard by the **Heavenly Tribunals**, and their petitions will reach the **Heavenly Gate** and the **Supreme Sovereign**. The **Supreme Sovereign** will rejoice and grant each petition, decreeing to the **Heavenly Officials**, who will then record their merits in the **Immortal Register**. When their merits reach three thousand, the **Supreme Sovereign** will bestow ten **Direct Immortal Children**, *(Note: one per day, two **Jade Boys**, one **Jade Girl Official**, and two **Attendant Officials** corresponding to the number of days’ **Direct Talismans**.)* twelve **Direct Jade Girls**, *(Note: two per day, one **Jade Girl Official**, one to record **Yin-Function**, and one to petition the **Heavenly Gate** for matters concerning mortals and petitions to the **Heavenly Tribunals**.)* one **True Official**, *(Note: **Jiazi** is **Wang Wenqing**, **Yichou** is **Long Jiqing**; these are used cyclically within the **Six Jia**, repeating endlessly without bound.)* and **Attendant Officials** corresponding to the number of days’ **Direct Talismans**, summoned by name according to the day to fulfill their duties without transgression. *(Note: Summoning them to fulfill their duties means no transgression. If not summoned to fulfill their duties, it is a violation of the laws.)* two **Direct Talismans**. *(Note: The talismans for the day’s duties are used to save others from calamities and harm.)* The person performing the **Six Jia Yin-Function** duties rotates endlessly without interruption, and none shall transgress. *(Note: Transgressors act falsely, harming others, deceiving people, and leading them to licentious worship. The **Six Jia Yin-Function Jade Girls**, the **Six Jia Lords**, and the **Northern Dipper Lord** will greatly resent this, turning it into misfortune for the transgressor. This is the meaning of **‘the fox assuming the tiger’s威’**—deceiving others for gain. The crime is twofold: first, the great crime of deceiving others; second, the harm done to the deceived person’s body and mind. Though originally free from calamity, they falsely petition the **Northern Dipper**, claiming misfortune, which is a false accusation against Heaven and Earth. The gods of the **Heavenly Gate** resent licentious worship and thus intercept the petition. Next, the finger-star of their original birth is implicated, and the person will instead incur guilt, suffer reduced lifespan, and be consigned to an evil path. If there is genuine calamity, one must still follow the **Northern Dipper’s** rites—any deviation is also transgression. Each offense is calculated, and when **Yin-Function** is complete, one ascends as an immortal.)\"\n\nThe **Later Sage** told the **Celestial Master**: \"The **Six Jia’s Yin-Function** can achieve great merit. All ten thousand gods between Heaven and Earth are the **Six Jia Lords’** subordinates. If they act with righteousness and propriety, benefiting mortals with compassion and reverence, their laws and blessings flow like恩福, nourishing the common people, and their deeds are called **benevolent and efficacious**. They neither kill nor harm, neither practice sorcery nor falsity—this is called **Yin-Blessings flowing to save**, *(Note: whether through talismanic healing or invoking dragons to bring rain, benefiting ten thousand towns and villages, nourishing the nation, and bringing joy to the people—all are at peace, and their merit is great.)*\n\nThe ten thousand towns and people rejoice in peace, their merit piled high as mountains.\nIt is not merely for your single life or family that you inherit the blessings of immortality across generations.\n\nIf they act without reliance on scripture and masters, falsely practicing sorcery and deceit, they cause licentious worship of Heaven, Earth, and the starry hosts.\nTheir crimes will instead invite **retributive decrements**, forfeiting lifespan—both they and others will bear punishment.\n\nThe **Rectified-One’s** *jiào* rites have their own origins, their ceremonies drawn from the **Three Celestial Cycles**.\n\n*(Note: The Celestial Master spoke in secret to King Chang Zhao Sheng: The law of **Rectified-One** originated with the **Venerable Lord**. The Venerable Lord concealed this law on the **Celestial Terrace**, then after countless eons, revealed it anew, calling himself the **Later Sage**, descending from Heaven to bestow it upon me. Alongside this, he granted the **Three Assemblies’** rites, offerings, and libations—like the world’s communal sacrifices, like a military encampment’s provisions. All must be performed at the proper time; if missed, it cannot be done. If held on another day, it is no longer the proper *jiào*—it becomes **Three Celestial Cycles** in vain.\n\nOn this day, one may gather a **Three Celestial Cycles** assembly, where the **Venerable Lord** and **Later Sage** permit it: the rites convene the **Three Celestial Cycles**, the **Five Phases**, the **Six Jia Lords**, the **Seven Stars**, the **Nine Spirits** and **Nine Essences**, the **Twenty-Eight Constellations**, the **Thirty-Five Officials**, the **Forty-Nine Officials**, and the **One Hundred Twenty Officers**—leading Heaven’s armies in the hundreds of billions, commanding the myriad star-forms. This is the day of their descent to feast, all sated and drunk, bestowing blessings upon the body and family, extending even to the **Lower Celestial Cycle’s** Five Sacred Peaks and Four Great Rivers. The **Community Altars**, **Temple Deities**, and **Spiritual Officials** are likewise sated and drunk, while the host receives blessings.\n\nIf not performed on this day, but held as a reckless *jiào* assembly—whether invoking one’s **natal destiny**, the **Six Jia**, or the **Four Seasons and Eight Nodes**—burning money and offerings, this falls under **licentious worship**. Wayward ghosts and wild spirits will come to gluttonously partake, while the **Rectified-One’s** deities and the **starry hosts** will not descend. Only the **three generals of the talismanic spirit** within the body may eat; those in Heaven and Earth cannot descend to feast. They will rage in fury, instead harming the body—how much more could one then seek virtue and blessings?\n\nYou are my disciple—be cautious and do not act thus. If you disregard this and stray from the Dao, you will harm your body and family. Be warned.)\n\nThe *jiào* rites must be performed strictly according to the prescribed methods, ensuring no failure to harmonize with the **Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water**, thereby invoking the **Dao’s transformative power**.\n\nIf one disregards this and instead summons **unauthorized forces**, it becomes a **yin-disaster**—a term for calamity. *[Note: An alternative name for misfortune.]*\nIn the past, there were those who habitually engaged in licentious worship, their transgressions clear. How much more could they then seek virtue and blessings?\n\nYou must understand this clearly: As a disciple instructed in the **Rectified-One’s Three Primordial Talismans**, do not indulge in **licentious sorcery** or deceive the world. Only by adhering to the **Six Jia’s merit** will one naturally attain the Dao without deviation.\n\nThe **Venerable Lord** said: This is called the **\"Ten Yin-Mercies of the Six Jia\"**—those who practice must treasure and conceal it, for only by following this will one naturally attain the Dao.\n\n---\n**The *Six Jia Ling Shu* (Sacred Scriptures of the Six Jia) – Yang-Merits**\nThere is also the *Six Jia Ling Shu*, which expounds on **yang-merits**, comprising ten sections.\nHere, the ten precepts are briefly recorded. *[Note: Fully elaborated in *The Transmission of the Venerable Lord*.]*\n\n1. **Broadly gathering causes and conditions**, assembling congregations, constructing earthen and wooden pavilions and halls—accumulating merits numbering in the ten-thousands—this is called **yang-merit**, uncounted among the yin.\n   The **Sage Sovereign** said: Such a person, in a future life, will become an official, possess wealth and grand halls, with prosperous descendants yet no noble status.\n\n2. **Observing fasts and reciting scriptures**, accumulating merits numbering in the ten-thousands—this is called **yang-merit**, uncounted among the yin.\n   The **Lord** said: In a future life, one will be endowed with wisdom, with clear and upright ears and eyes, having virtuous sons and daughters who are filial, and attaining official rank.\n\n3. **Exhorting others to do good**, prompting almsgiving, and donating wealth numbering in the ten-thousands—this too is **yang-merit**, uncounted among the yin.\n   The **Lord** said: In a future life, one will become a leader among people, the chief of those who consume flesh, with descendants inheriting this status across generations.\n\n4. **Acting with sincere devotion and labor**, broadly constructing earthen and wooden structures, erecting frameworks for halls and temples, and rigorously clearing mountain paths—this too is **flourishing merit**, uncounted among the yin.\n   The **Lord** said: In a future life, one will be reborn as a male, holding an official position with wealth, slaves, and servants at their command, with prosperity lasting two generations—yet afterward, one’s station will decline. The **Great Dao forbids such ambition**.\n\n5. **Casting and crafting bells and statues**, completing the merit of becoming an immortal—where statues manifest the transient goodness of mortals—this too is **yang-merit**, uncounted among the yin.\n   The **Lord** said: In a future life, one will be skilled in song and music, with a well-proportioned body, yet lacking in wealth and sustenance.\n\n6. **Reciting incantations idly**, invoking them loudly and calling out to chastise ghosts and spirits—even if it saves a person—this is **yang-merit**.\n   The **Lord** told the **Celestial Master**: Though this merit is not fully attained, it still emerges from the body, yet because the chastisement is excessive, in a future life one will suffer few illnesses but lack descendants.\n\n7. **Digging wells along roads and rivers**, providing water and gruel—this too is **yang-merit**.\n   Though this act benefits others, it aligns with **yin-speech of merit**, as it is said, *\"So-and-so dug this well.\"*\n   The **Lord** said: Such a person’s descendants will receive half of the yin-merit, while the individual attains yang-merit, transforming into benevolent deeds that aid those in urgent need.\n\n8. **Leveraging official authority or borrowed strength to rescue others from罪**, this too is **yang-merit**.\n   The **Lord** said: In a future life, one will receive blessings, or perhaps reap rewards in this very life—this is the merit of **auspicious yang**.\n\n9. **Constructing bridges and causeways**, facilitating passage and transit—this too is **yang-merit**.\n   The **Lord** said: In a future life, one will constantly benefit from the kindness of travelers.\n\n10. **Receiving ordination and taking vows**, with a pure mind and spirit, abstaining from marriage, and dwelling in high mountains—this too is **yang-merit**.\n   The **Lord** said: In a future life, one will attain the Dao of **non-action**.\n\n---\nThese ten are called the **\"Ten Yang-Merits\"**, uncounted among the yin.\nIn the past, the **Highest True Ones** and **Ascended Immortals** all practiced **yin-merits and yin-virtues**, unlike the ten recorded histories of the ten yang-merits.\n\nIn antiquity, the **Divine Ancestor and Sage Sovereign** served as **Three Pillars of History** in the **Yin and Zhou dynasties**, as **Chancellor and Minister** for sixty-four sovereigns over seven hundred and fifty-one years. Then, crossing westward through the pass into the **Barbarian lands**, *[as transmitted:]* he had eighty-four wives and two hundred and forty children. *[As recorded in the Inner Transmission.]*\nHe transformed the **Barbarian King into a Buddha-Immortal**, later ascending to become the **Emperor of the Golden Gate of Great Peace, the Morning Star of the Supreme Dao, the Posterior Sage, and the Primordial Lord of the Mysterious Origin**. His successors continued practicing **yin-merits**, accumulating **yin-virtues**, and teaching the **Dao of Non-Action** without relying on those who dwell in mountains and forests.\n\nOver time, ascending ever higher, past, present, and future lives—\n**receiving unbroken blessings from virtuous deeds**—\n*[End of the Nineteenth Volume of *The Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl*]*\n*[Beginning of the Twentieth Volume of *The Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl*]*.\n\nThe **Grand Sovereign of the Complete Perfection of the Chinese Realm**, namely **Zhang Daoling of the Peaceful Dao**, **Zhao Shengwang**, **Wang Chang**, **Commander Li Zhongfu**, **Master Mao Ying**, **Xu Yufu**, and others, were their descendants who compiled the scriptures.\n\nThe **Dao-Immortal Li Chunfeng** annotated the **Six Jiao and Seven Stars**—the talismans and methods for national defense, repelling bandits, and delivering from calamities and misfortunes.\n\n**Lao Jun** said: *\"Seven Stars—*\nthese are the children of the **Six Jiao**,\nseven women in total.\nSome were once **empresses**, **consorts**, or **Jiao women**,\neach adorned in floral garments.\nThey emerged from the lineage of the **Five Clans and Six Jiao**,\nsince the time of **Pangu the Primordial**,\nand were already visible as seven stars—\nseen by both **heavenly beings and mortals**.\nThis is the very name of the **Primordial Origin**,\nthe manifestation of the **Great Dao** at its dawn.\nBorn in the **floating heavens**,\nthey revolve within the **one-day-one-night cosmic cycle**,\nmeasuring the earth’s degrees with precision—\nhence, they are called **Seven Stars**.\nThey oversee the **registers of death** for the **Ten Thousand Heavens and myriad people**,\nand govern the illnesses and misfortunes of the living,\nas well as calamities, grief, and harm.\nThey command and annihilate **ghosts and spirits**,\na division under the **Ancient Sage, the Great Dao Sovereign**.\nWhen one invokes the **Six Jiao talisman’s power**,\ncombining it to deploy them,\nthe **Six Jiao** are the parents of the **Seven Stars**,\nso those who wear the **Six Jiao talisman**\nseek to command the **Seven Stars**.\nIn ancient times, the **Supreme Dao-Immortal** wore it for longevity,\ncommanding the **Seven Stars** at will.\nHe also bestowed upon **Cun, Li Deng, Meng Xian, Li FuRen, the Western Queen Mother, Ma Gu, and Wang Fangping**—\nnone of whom failed to subdue the **Five Phases and Six Jiao**,\nthus enabling the **Northern Dipper to attain immortality**.\nSince the **Northern Dipper governs death**,\nit is feared by the **yin-officials**,\nand **ghosts and spirits** submit to its command.\nIf the **Northern Dipper’s envoys** refuse to obey,\nthose it points to die instantly.\nIt is said that wherever the **Heavenly Gate** is directed,\nthere are deaths and injuries.\nThus, the **Supreme Sage** commands it to traverse the **cosmic cycle**—\nonce daily, once nocturnally.\nAnd when paired with the corresponding garments,\nthe *Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl* refers to this as **paired garments**.\nIn ancient times, great **Dao-Immortals** practiced without offering sacrifices to the **Northern Dipper**.\nLesser **Dao-Immortals**, with limited vision,\nwould sacrifice to the **Northern Dipper**.\nWhy is this?\nBecause the **Northern Dipper** is a **god of the six yin-forces**,\nfond of killing and averse to nurturing life.\nThe **Supreme Dao Sovereign** loathed its presence,\nso he instructed the **Supreme Lao Jun**,\nwho in turn taught their successors to wear it as **garments of command**,\nwith twenty-four stipulations—\nfully detailed in the **generalized conditions** for all affairs.\nAll are listed to the left.\n\n---\n\n**First Condition:**\nTread the *Earthly Measure* forward, backward, and reversed—three cycles.\nWhen finished,\nforward and backward are the *Earthly Measure’s* framework,\noriginating from the front—\nin accordance with the principle of ascending from earth to heaven.\nRecite the *Eighteen Incantations* once.\nTread the *Heavenly Halter* forward, backward, and reversed—three cycles.\nWhen finished,\nrecite the *Eleven Incantations* once.\nFor distant national command,\nspeak while pointing—\neven at a thousand *li* away, it shall take effect.\nBut if directed toward a certain quarter,\nperform the ritual remotely,\nturning the enemy’s forces back—\nstrengthening one’s own troops,\nwhile the enemy’s *inverse qi* causes their entire army to collapse in defeat.\nPerform this three times,\nand bestow the talisman upon the national *Great General*,\nwho wears it to ensure victory—\nthe enemy shall be utterly broken.\nAfter reciting the *Step Incantations*,\npass over the talisman,\nand pinch the *Key Seal*—\nthe *Key Seal* is on the third joint of the left fifth finger, on the right side.\nWith vermilion or ink, mark it for twenty days—\nthe enemy shall tremble in fear, unable to resist.\n\nThe Later Sage Emperor declared:\n*\"To save the nation and its people,\nto pacify and subdue rebels—\nthis is the supreme yin-virtue.\nBut if used for treachery,\ndefying the sovereign,\nthe Heavenly Lock shall return harm to your own body—\ndisaster shall strike immediately.\"*\n\n**The Former Sage’s Military Talisman**—\nIf entered on the right, the Military Talisman is auspicious,\ngranting the power to soar a thousand *li*.\n**The Former Sage’s Command Talisman**—\nIf entered on the right, the Command Talisman is auspicious.\nThe Northern Dipper’s decree turns the Heavenly Lock,\npointing at the enemy who harms us—\nthe talisman shall fly a thousand *li* on its own.\n\nThe **Imperial Edict Talisman** reads:\n*\"The White Tiger commands ten thousand troops,\nthe Dark-Subduing Jade Maiden is [designated] as General [Name],\nresolving calamities and dispelling misfortune,\ncommanding Great General [Name],\nto achieve victory and military strength—\nthe enemy, by this talisman’s decree, shall swiftly be

thousand soldiers—**\none talisman suffices for a thousand troops.\nIf the *Great General* commands ten thousand,\nten men may wear it—\nensuring overwhelming strength in battle.\"\n\nThe Later Sage Emperor proclaimed:\n*\"These two talismans were granted by Lao Jun\nas a secret method to repel enemies—\nworth ten thousand gold pieces and never to be divulged.\n[Alternatively,] one may add the *Assisting Seal* to the talisman.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Second Condition:**\nTread the *Heavenly Halter* forward, backward, and reversed—three cycles.\nRecite the *Eleven Incantations* once.\nWhen finished,\ntread the *Earthly Measure* forward, backward, and reversed—three cycles,\nand recite the *Eighteen Incantations* once.\nScatter into the *Yǔ Steps*—three strides, nine traces—\nturn the Heavenly Lock,\nand point at the *Six Metal-and-Bronze Talismans*,\none by one, to rescue living beings from illness.\n\nThe military method aligns heart and hand,\nswifter than water or fire.\n\nThe Later Sage Emperor bestowed this talisman upon the Heavenly Master,\ndeclaring:\n*\"This talisman invokes the Five Phases’ decrees\nand dispatches messengers—\nthe Northern Dipper’s Lock is its key.\nThere are now nine talismans:\ntwo from the Former Sage,\ngoverning military commands,\nas the Nine Stars turn the Lock,\npointing at enemies and saving people.\nThe Later Sage Emperor further bestows seven talismans—\nfirst, the **Lion-King Talisman**.\"*\n\nThe **Lion-King Talisman** (first) cures the White Tiger’s ailments—painful gout and restless movement—\nwhere pain feels like knife thrusts.\nThe Daoist adept revives the dead, restoring life—\nits efficacy is great, yet it must not be used recklessly.\nThose who misuse it will surely incur Heaven’s retribution.\n\nThe Later Sage Emperor instructed the Heavenly Master:\n*\"This talisman must not be given to anyone but those of the utmost Daoist virtue,\nor close kin, or sovereigns and regional lords.\nIt must not be used recklessly.\"*\n\nThe **Green Dragon Talisman** (second) is most potent in summoning dragon spirits,\ncontrolling rain—its effects manifest in moments.\nIt can also pursue and subdue fox spirits, demons, and celestial malevolent beings,\nall with unerring success.\n\nThe Later Sage Emperor declared:\n*\"Only regional governors may wield it—\nno ordinary person should dare.\"*\n\nThe **White Tiger Talisman** (third) is supremely skilled in leading armies without casualties,\na weapon of war that crushes foes without fail.\nA single general bearing this talisman\ncan match the strength of a thousand men.\n\nThe Later Sage Emperor told Huangshigong:\n*\"War is the Yang thief of the White Tiger’s spirit,\nthus it repels armies—\nits power aligns with the Northern Dipper’s Lock-turning force.\"*\n\nThe **Vermilion Bird Talisman** (fourth) is most effective against the Five Metal Spirits,\nand in warding off blades and swords in battle.\nIt harmonizes with the virtue of Wood,\ncuring malevolent illnesses, silencing slander,\ncommanding celestial deities, and summoning the Thunder Lord,\npursuing the Lightning Master and the Zero Mother,\nensuring all desires are fulfilled.\n\nThe Later Sage Emperor said:\n*\"This talisman prohibits the use of Yang\n\nThe third method: recite the **Threefold Heavenly Circuit Talisman** in forward, reverse, and inverted order.\n\nWhen finished, recite the incantation as before once, then proceed with the **Earthly Cycle** in forward, reverse, and inverted order.\n\nWhen finished, recite the **Eighteen Dao Talisman** once.\n\nThen speak aloud: *\"I, so-and-so, was born on the [date], under the influence of [such-and-such] star, with the [current] year’s principal destiny and fundamental fate. Throughout my life, misfortunes and calamities shall be measured and dispelled by this talisman. When the heavens are clear and the stars shine brightly, day and night observing my native constellation, then misfortunes shall be obscured. If calamities arise, they must be subdued and appeased by proper ritual—never shall there be failure.\"*\n\n**Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl**—the twenty-first invocation\n**Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl**—the twenty-second invocation\n\nThe **Grand Sovereign of All-Pure Daoists**, Zhang Daoling, the **King of Balance** (Zhuangsheng), **Master of Command** (Longji), Li Zhongfu, Mao Ying, Xu Yufu, and others, composed this as a substitute.\n\n**Daoist Master Li Chunfeng** annotated:\n*\"The method of correlating the **Twenty-Eight Constellations**, observing their luminosity, and determining life’s prosperity or decline through the brightness or obscurity of the **native star**.\"*\n\n**The Twenty-Eight Constellations’ Monthly Correspondences**\n\n**Spring Months (2nd–7th lunar months):**\n1st day: **Kui, Wei, Bi, Shen, Gui, Zhang**\n2nd day: **Lou, Mao, Zui, Jing, Liu, Yi**\n3rd day: **Wei, Bi, Shen, Xing, Zhen**\n4th day: **Mao, Zui, Jing, Liu, Zhang, Jiao**\n5th day: **Bi, Shen, Xing, Yi, Yuan**\n6th day: **Zui, Jing, Liu, Zhang, Zhen, Shi**\n7th day: **Shen, Xing, Yi, Jiao, Fang**\n8th day: **Jing, Liu, Zhang, Zhen, Kang, Xin**\n9th day: **Xing, Yi, Jiao, Shi, Wei**\n10th day: **Liu, Zhang, Zhen, Fang, Ju**\n11th day: **Xing, Yi, Jiao, Xin, Dou**\n12th day: **Zhang, Zhen, Fang, Wei, Nü**\n13th day: **Yi, Jiao, Xin, Ju, Xu**\n14th day: **Zhen, Kang, Fang, Wei, Dou, Wei**\n15th day: **Jiao, Xin, Ju, Nü, Shi**\n16th day: **Kang, Fang, Wei, Xu, Bi**\n17th day: **Xin, Ju, Nü, Wei, Kui**\n18th day: **Fang, Wei, Dou, Xu, Lou**\n19th day: **Xin, Ju, Nü, Wei, Bi, Wei**\n20th day: **Wei, Dou, Xu, Kui, Mao**\n21st day: **Ju, Nü, Wei, Lou, Bi**\n22nd day: **Dou, Xu, Kui, Wei, Zui**\n23rd day: **Nü, Wei, Lou, Mao, Shen**\n24th day: **Xu, Kui, Wei, Bi, Jing**\n25th day: **Wei, Lou, Mao, Zui, Gui**\n26th day: **Shi, Kui, Wei, Bi, Liu**\n27th day: **Wei, Lou, Mao, Zui, Jing, Xing**\n28th day: **Kui, Wei, Bi, Shen, Gui, Zhang**\n29th day: **Lou, Mao, Zui, Jing, Liu, Yi**\n30th day: **Wei, Bi, Shen, Xing, Zhen**\n\n**Autumn-Winter Months (8th–1st lunar months):**\n1st day: **Jiao, Shi, Xin, Dou, Xu, Shi**\n2nd day: **Kang, Fang, Wei, Nü, Wei, Mao**\n3rd day: **Xin, Ju, Xu, Kui, Wei**\n4th day: **Fang, Wei, Dou, Wei, Bi, Lou**\n5th day: **Xin, Ju, Nü, Shi, Kui, Wei**\n6th day: **Wei, Dou, Xu, Bi, Lou, Mao**\n7th day: **Ju, Nü, Wei, Kui, Bi, Shen**\n8th day: **Dou, Xu, Shi, Lou, Mao, Zui**\n9th day: **Nü, Wei, Bi, Shen, Jing**\n10th day: **Xu, Kui, Mao, Zui, Jing**\n11th day: **Wei, Bi, Lou, Shen, Gui**\n12th day: **Shi, Kui, Wei, Zui, Jing, Liu**\n13th day: **Bi, Lou, Mao, Shen, Xing**\n14th day: **Kui, Wei, Bi, Jing, Liu, Zhang**\n15th day: **Lou, Mao, Zui, Gui, Xing, Yi**\n16th day: **Wei, Bi, Shen, Liu, Zhang, Zhen**\n17th day: **Mao, Zui, Jing, Xing, Yi, Jiao**\n18th day: **Bi, Shen, Gui, Zhang, Zhen, Yuan**\n19th day: **Zui, Jing, Liu, Yi, Jiao, Shi**\n20th day: **Shen, Xing, Zhen, Yuan, Fang**\n21st day: **Jing, Liu, Zhang, Jiao, Xin**\n22nd day: **Gui, Xing, Yi, Yuan, Fang, Wei**\n23rd day: **Liu, Zhang, Zhen, Xin, Ju**\n24th day: **Yi, Jiao, Fang, Wei, Dou**\n25th day: **Zhang, Zhen, Yuan, Xin, Ju, Nü**\n26th day: **Yi, Jiao, Shi, Xin, Xu**\n27th day: **Zhen, Yuan, Fang, Ju, Nü, Wei**\n28th day: **Jiao, Shi, Xin, Dou, Xu, Shi**\n29th day: **Yuan, Fang, Wei, Nü, Wei, Bi**\n30th day: **Shi, Xin, Ju, Xu, Kui**\n\n**Method of Calculation:**\nThe above corresponds to a full year of twelve months, each with thirty days. One must align the individual’s **native star** with the day’s constellation, beginning from the first day and concluding on the thirtieth. Each month’s sequence is matched accordingly.\n\nThe **Supreme Primordial Lord Laozi**, having received instruction from the **Primordial Dao Lord Yuan Shi**, recorded this as the *Scripture of the Twenty-Eight Constellations*, comprising twelve volumes and two hundred sheets—its vastness making it difficult to fully explore.\n\nLater, the **Sage Emperor** descended from **Nanshan** (now **Zhongnan Mountain**), in the **thirteenth year of the Great Achievement** (617 CE), revealing to the **Tang Dynasty’s Li clan**, who ruled under Heaven. Now, this abridged version of the *Twenty-Eight Constellations Scripture* is compiled to correspond with the thirty days of each month, demonstrating how to correlate and observe one’s **native star** to discern prosperity or decline.\n\nThus, the **Edict of Edging Through** is condensed into essential principles, teaching humanity to record and reflect upon it.\n\nThe **Supreme Primordial Lord Laozi** declared:\n*\"For those cultivating longevity, knowing one’s **native star**—the constellation governing one’s birth—is paramount. The **wandering star** is the constellation of one’s life’s destiny.\n\nIf the **native star** aligns perfectly in its proper position, yet a **wandering star** intrudes upon it, this is most malevolent, bringing great calamity. If only the **wandering star** intrudes, the consequences are lighter.\n\nThese two matters must be carefully observed: if the star is bright, misfortune will not befall; if it is dim, illness and disaster will arise. One must act swiftly, invoking talismans and rituals to dispel them, thereby eliminating sickness and averting decline.\n\nOn one’s **native star’s day**, if the night is clear, observe it secretly when no one is about. If it is bright and clear, it is auspicious; if dim or flickering, disaster is near; if unseen, great misfortune looms.\n\nThen, recite the **Earth-Treading Step** and the **Heavenly Halter** each three times, perform the **Yugaitian Steps**, and turn the **Heavenly Pass**. Point toward the direction of the afflicted person’s **star of decline or ghostly abode**—for all are born into regions of calamity.\n\nFor instance, a **Metal-born** individual has:\n- **Longevity** in **Si (Peril)**,\n- **Bathing** in **Wu (Boiling)**,\n- **Crowning** in **Wei (Encirclement)**,\n- **Official Duty** in **Shen (Apply)**,\n- **Sovereignty** in **You (Jade)**,\n- **Decline** in **Xu (Empty)**,\n- **Sickness** in **Hai (Hide)**,\n- **Death** in **Zi (Self)**,\n- **Tomb** in **Chou (Rest)**,\n- **Ruination** in **Yin (Conceal)**,\n- **Severance** in **Mao (Insult)**.\n\nIf any of the **Five Phases’** stars fall into these regions of decline, regardless of whether the **native star** is visible, decline will manifest. One must act to dispel it.\n\nPerform this ritual **three times monthly**. If the star remains bright, one will have no worries—disasters and calamities will vanish.\"*\n\n「Indeed, those who study with the resolve to follow the Dao must first comprehend this method, only then may they attain the true preservation of life.\n\nIf one does not understand the matters of decline and calamity, they will fall ill and die. This method can help people dispel disasters, overcome misfortunes, and ward off sickness, even saving relatives and Daoist companions.\n\nWhen observing the native star, if it is faint or obscured—whether unseen or displaced by other stars—killing the native star will cause **180 people** to perish in that direction, according to the phase. **180 people** in the East, **136 in the West**, **164 in the South**, **125 in the North**, and **1,200 in the Central Palace**—why so?\n\nThe Central Palace belongs to **Earth**, and when Earth loses its position, it multiplies the harm done to all other directions, which people should not fail to recognize. Those who know this method may follow its principles, saving themselves first and then ten others.\n\nBut among the **Twenty-Eight Constellations**, each constellation governs countless billions of people beneath it. If one practices this method, they may save a hundred souls, yet the world remains unaware—how much more so for saving just one life or a few relatives and friends, who would still be saved. Yet people remain ignorant, openly receiving the **Ming** (dark) commands from the celestial agents, who come to summon them to death—this is truly a grievous fate!\n\nThose dwelling at the edges of the heavens beneath the native star will also suffer hundreds or thousands of deaths.\n\nThose who cultivate life and preserve their bodies must always observe their native star’s position in the **Twenty-Eight Constellations**, to discern the signs of their own rise or decline. This Dao is of utmost importance: without cause, one’s body will not decline or fall ill.\n\nMoreover, when the star is bright and clear, one need not perform the **步蹑 (Bujie)** steps or the **祭醮 (Jijiao)** rituals. If they do, they will instead invite disasters and calamities upon their entire household, not just themselves.\n\nThe **Laozi (Lao Jun)** has universally commanded this prohibition, and those in **white robes** (laypersons) do not accept it, while those who invert the Dao (false teachers) often allow the **天关 (Tian Guan)** agents to turn and point at the native stars of people.\n\nThe later sage-emperor declared: *\"White robes do not accept\"* refers to those who invoke the **七星 (Qi Xing, Seven Stars)** or **六甲 (Liu Jia, Six Jia)** in the *金锁流珠 (Jin Suo Liu Zhu)* scriptures and borrow from teachers—those who falsely claim to teach, yet write out entire texts without proper transmission, or even if they receive them, do not verify with the teacher’s seal or voice, or lightly assume the teacher’s authority, or have the teacher’s name appended without genuine transmission—such are the crimes of **罔师 (Wang Shi, false teaching)**, and they will not die naturally.\n\nHow much worse for those who further seek this Dao, yet fail to attain peace even for themselves! The deceivers of the Dao are known to the **三官 (San Guan, Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water)**, who will surely report them to the **道祖 (Dao Zu, Daoist Patriarch)**, and the **天师 (Tian Shi, Celestial Master)** will be notified. Both the patriarch and the master will censure these deceitful thieves of the Dao, and their entire families will be struck down by Heaven’s punishment, dying unnatural deaths.\n\nIn ancient times, there was a man named **张山子 (Zhang Shanzi)**, whose given name was **初见 (Chu Jian)**. His daughter was **小王夫人 (Xiao Wang Fu Ren)**, also known as the **阿母 (Amu, Mother) of the Six Jia**.»\n\n「If one possesses this book and reveres it with a single-minded devotion, never failing in its observances, yet after five years of practice, the **Celestial Master (天師)** still does not press his seal upon it—if he instead secretly uses the **San Guan (三官)**’s talismans of *Shuangxian Guan (天纲)* and *Dieji Guan (地紀)*, mastering the art of divine communication—then the transmission will never cease for a thousand years.\n\nWhen the **Xiao Wang Fu Ren (小王夫人)** saw this, she did not consider it a flaw but allowed him to proceed. Suddenly, one day, she was in her mountain retreat (*shanfang jing, 山房靖*) when seven men clad in garments of five colors appeared, claiming to be **heavenly emissaries (天使)**, sent to investigate **Zhang Shanzi (張山子)** for the crime of **stealing the Dao (盗道)**.\n\nThe **Xiao Wang Fu Ren** asked: *“What crime does he have?”*\n\nThe emissaries replied: *“The crime of **Wang Shi (罔師)**, stealing the Dao.”*\n\nThe **Xiao Wang Fu Ren** instructed them to have **Zhang Shanzi** write the *Jin Suo Liu Zhu (金鎖流珠)* scripture and the *Liu Tian (六式九符)* talismans, all paid for with silk, money, silver, and gold to a certain **Bu Ren (某乙)**. **Bu Ren** then petitioned the name of an **immortal (上仙)**, and only then did the writing commence. Once finished, the texts were passed along to the **Chu (楚) man Bo Yue (葛越)**, who received them in the same hall, and then departed.\n\nThe seven emissaries questioned the **Xiao Wang Fu Ren**, asking if she had sealed the talismans.\n\nThe **Xiao Wang Fu Ren**, pondering, recalled that he had left without receiving the immortal’s seal. The emissaries declared: *“This alone is the crime of **Wang Shi (罔師)**, stealing the Dao. Heaven commands his punishment.”*\n\nThe **Xiao Wang Fu Ren** fully realized the gravity of his failure to seal the texts. If he had received them and later defied the Dao, the guilt would have extended to her, and she would have been demoted to a lower stage of **Daoist rank (師階)**. She would then have suffered for a hundred years in the mortal realm, unable to ascend.\n\nNow, because of his own actions, he has incurred this punishment. He falsely claims that I am **Li Si Ming (李司命)**, the **Zhong Fu (仲甫)**, and refuses to accept this law. How could I, a **Daoist Master (師)**, accept the law from a woman’s hands? Even the households of **kings and nobles (王侯)** would not dare speak thus.\n\nWe, the seven, then went to **Songgao Mountain (嵩高山)**, to investigate **Bo Yue (葛越)**. His response was the same as that of the **Xiao Wang Fu Ren**.\n\nWe reported this to the **Supreme Sage (後聖君)**, who was enraged. How could he have knelt before a woman at that time, bowing to her as his master?\n\nNow, because of his defiance of the Dao, this is the crime of **Wang Shi (罔師)**, stealing the Dao. We were ordered to afflict him with illness, but we feared that the **Xiao Wang Fu Ren** might seal these talismans for him, using the law to rectify the situation. If she did so, it would implicate him in another crime, burdening her as well.\n\nThus, the **Supreme Sage (太上)** commanded us to question the **Xiao Wang Fu Ren** again.\n\nThe **Xiao Wang Fu Ren** answered: *“Indeed, I did not seal them.”*\n\n「When the celestial emissary was about to depart, he next declared: *“I am the **Supreme Marshal of the Northern Dipper (Northern Dipper Marshal)**, as well as the envoy of the **Twenty-Eight Constellations (Twenty-Eight Mansions)**. The **Supreme Sage (Taishang Xuan Yuan Shang Dao Jun)**** had instructed me to descend and investigate; this matter is not trivial. The **Xiao Wang Fu Ren** has indeed not sealed these talismans for all concerned—she rejoiced, and she rejoiced again.”*\nHaving spoken, he left.\n\nWithin half a year thereafter, **Zhang Shānzǐ (張山子)**, dwelling on **Mount Tai Bai (太白山)**, saw his entire household afflicted by an epidemic plague, all perishing—even to the last fowl and beast, all slain by **demonic forces (鬼)**. Thus, **Feng (風)** searched within the *Inner Transmission of the Mother and Daughter (Amu Xiaonü Neichuan)* and found its composition, intending to instruct the world.\n\nLet mortals be cautious not to act thus with **intentionality (行心)**, lest they betray their **master (師)** below and deceive the **Dao (Way)** above, and thus be struck down by heaven. How much more so if they seek the **Dao (Way)** itself! The **Dao (Way)** and its laws are impartial, allowing no transgressions. The **Great Dao (Way)** is without bias, taking only those who are without fault. The **Great Dao (Way)** is without favoritism, not permitting mortals to deceive one another. The **Dao (Way)** and its laws are without deceit, forbidding the disrespect of **masters (師)**. As noted before, do not repeat such offenses.\n\nSuch crimes must be heeded by those who study the **Dao (Way)**. The **Supreme Sage (Laojun)**** then told the **Forty-Nine True Persons of the Highest Grade (上品四十九真人)**: *“This **Northern Dipper Marshal (北斗君)** is the overseer of the **Four Cardinal Mansions (四方宿)**. He governs the affairs of the **Eighteen Constellations (十八宿)**; all matters are known to him first, and he does not allow lesser constellations to act as their superiors. For those who are **filial (孝)** yet defy the **Dao (Way)**, betray their **master (師)**, and rebel against their **lord (君)**, failing to honor their parents, even if they seek vengeance in this lifetime, their **crimes (罪)** will be repaid in the depths of time by the **celestial laws (日月)**—their punishment will be swift as **water and fire (水火)**, yet they will still not escape their fate.”*\nBe cautious, be cautious.\n\n**Daoist Rituals (醮祭) for the Northern Dipper and Twenty-Eight Constellations to Invoke the Celestial Laws (日月時法)**\n**Laojun (老君)** said: *“Those who practice the **Dao (Way)** and perform **rituals (醮祭)** must follow the **Five Marshal Laws (五斗君法)**. All must abide by the **scripted rites (科仪)** and observe the **auspicious times of the moon, day, and hour (月日时)**.”*\nThe *Scripture of Illuminating Truth (Mingzhen Ke)* states: *“In the **Spring (春)**, the **First Month (正月)** has the **Native Star Day (本命日)**; in **Autumn (秋)**, the **Seventh Month (七月)** has the **Native Star Day (本命日)**; in **Winter (冬)**, the **Tenth Month (十月)** has the **Native Star Day (本命日)**. The **hour (更)** should be the **second watch (二更时)** when the **stars and moon are clear (星月明朗)**—this is supreme. If not, then the **ritual platform (坛)** should be moved beneath the **house (屋)**, spread with **yellow earth (黄土)** to form the **platform (坛)**, shaped according to the **land’s contours (随地关挟长短曲直)**. Light **dozens of lamps (数十灯)** to illuminate the platform, mirroring the **intent of stars and moon (月星之意)**.”*\n\nThe **Supreme Sage (Taishang Jun)**** then told the **Celestial Master (天師)**: *“You wish to perform **rituals (醮祭)**. Within the **Daoist scriptures (道法箓)**, the **Generals of the Five Pecks (五斗)**, the **Celestial Officials (仙灵官)**, and **Taiyi (太一)** and **Eryi (二仪)**, the **Three Elements (三元)** and **Four Seasons (四时)**, the **Five Phases (五行)** and **Six Celestial Stems (六甲)**, as well as the **Seven Stars (七星)** and **Twenty-Eight Constellations (二十八宿)**, all must be invoked during the **Spring, Autumn, or Winter (春秋冬)** **First Month (孟月)**, on the **Native Star Day (本命日)** or a **selected auspicious day (吉日)** that harmonizes with their **Native Star (命)**. The ritual must be conducted under **clear skies (晴明)**—if **wind, thunder, clouds, or rain obscure the sun (风雷云雨星宿不见日)**, it is **inauspicious (凶)**. You previously chose a day, but I fear that **nighttime wind, rain, or clouds (夜风雨云)** may darken the **earthly coordinates (蹑地纪)**. Thus, the **Heavenly Mandate (天纲)** must be invoked in **three sequential (顺)、inverted (倒)、and reversed (反)** cycles. Upon completion, disperse in **Yubu Steps (禹步)**—three steps, nine traces—and don ritual attire. Point diagonally toward the **direction of wind and rain (云雨之处)**; if the timing is right, the **ritual will open (应时有开)**. Then **twist the talisman (捻诀)**, holding the **fire knife (火刀)** upright. The **second phalanx of the left hand’s middle finger (左手第二指第三节)** points to the right.\n\nThe **incantation (咒)** reads:\n*“I wish to cultivate and practice, invoking the **Five Pecks and Thirty-Five Stars (五斗三十五星)**. Today is my **Native Star Day (本命日)**—may the **clouds gather and rain cease (仰云收雨)**, the **wind still (静风)**, and the **seven luminaries (七曜) shine brightly (朗明)**. Swiftly, swiftly, as the **Heavenly Laws decree (如律令)**.”*\n**Immediately, the skies will clear (须臾即晴)**.\n\nThis method is most secret—do not recklessly transmit it to the unworthy.\nTo do so recklessly invites Heaven and Earth’s retribution, and the blame will fall upon the teacher.\n\nWhen the day aligns with one’s fate as auspicious, it is supreme; if inauspicious, it is ominous and must not be used.\n\nIn selecting a day, one must choose three **Native Star Days (本命日)** within a year: the first month of spring, the seventh month of autumn, and the tenth month of winter. Days chosen within these three months are supreme; otherwise, the ritual is performed in vain, without adherence to the prescribed rites, and will invite Heaven and Earth’s retribution.\n\nThe later sage-king declared: If one truly suffers illness or is as frail as a flickering candle, one may secretly seek a favorable day and perform the ritual for oneself. If unable, a Daoist friend or teacher may act in one’s stead. If none are available, a husband may act for his wife, a wife for her husband, a son for his father, or a father for his son—any such substitution is permissible.\n\nOutsiders must not presume to act, lest the **Yellow Emperor (王皇)** take notice, for the **Marshal of the Northern Dipper (北斗君)** will then hold them accountable.\n\nThe **Marshal of the Northern Dipper (北斗君)** and the officials of the **Twenty-Eight Constellations (七宿官)** are most august—women must not go to observe or secretly pay homage. If they do, the Marshal will take grave offense, and the offender will suffer in life: misfortune in officialdom, slanderous tongues, shortened lifespan, and an untimely death.\n\nBeware.\n\nIf unable, a teacher, disciple, or parent-child may act in place. The **Celestial Master (天师)** has already composed the rites for the **One Cycle (一元)** within this text.\n\nHerein are recorded the rites for the **Native Star Day (本命日)** invocation of the **Northern Dipper (北斗)** and the **Twenty-Eight Constellations (二十八宿)**.\n\n---\n**End of Volume Twenty-One of *The Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl***\n**Begin Volume Twenty-Two of *The Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl***\n\n**Volume Twenty-Two of *The Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl***\n\nThe **Grand Sovereign of the Dao** Zhang Daoling, along with the successive scribes **Zhuang Wang Fangping, Zhao Sheng, Wang Chang, Li Zhongfu, Mao Ying, and Xu Yufu**, and the **Daoist Immortal Li Chunfeng** in his annotations, have compiled the **Rites for Invoking the Seven Stars and Twenty-Eight Constellations**.\n\n**Offerings:**\nEleven tiers of cakes and fruits—\nCakes must be fresh and pure,\nFruits must be dates and chestnuts, newly gathered.\n\nTwo wine jars and forty-five ladles,\nForty-five slices of deer jerky,\nNow mixed with fruits and placed.\n\nThree censers, one each of *jian* and *zhi* beans,\nEight lamps, each adorned with tassels.\n\nThree altars, three platters,\nNine cups and one lamp,\nNine *liang* of jerky per slice,\nTen tea leaves,\nFourteen bowls of hot water,\nEight mats,\nTwo thousand two hundred strings of cash—\nIf only a minor invocation is performed, these are not required.\n\nOnce the small altar is arranged, purification is conducted as prescribed.\nProceed to the platform as usual.\n\n**Ritual Posture:**\nStand upright, then kneel.\n\nFirst, strike the teeth **twelve times**—\nFor a minor invocation, **thirty-six times** if performing the greater rite.\n\nNext, ignite the censer.\n*\"To the Most High Primordial, the Five Spirits, the Venerable Old One!\"*\n\nNow summon the **Functionary Officials**, the **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords**, the **Incense-Bearing Attendants**, and the **Three-One Upright Spirits** to swiftly open the **Three Heavens** for the **Primordial Venerable Old Lord**.\n\n*\"Your servant now burns incense, arranges the offerings, and performs the invocation in the Dao.\nMay the Most High’s **Ten Directions’ True Vital Qi** descend upon this servant’s body.\nFor the invocation on behalf of [specific person], your servant humbly petitions.\nSwiftly convey this to the **Supreme Jade Emperor of the True, Boundless, and Limitless** at His throne.\nWhen finished, kneel upright.\"*\n\nNext, offer wine **three times**.\n\nThen recite the invocation rites.\n\n**Meditative Invocation:**\nVisualize the **General and his officers and soldiers**—half arriving from the **Northwest Heavenly Gate**, half emerging from the **forehead**—to attend the ritual feast.\n\nThe **Supreme Mystic** proclaims, *\"Here, at [location], we solemnly offer the invocation rites.\"*\nThe servant responds, *\"Today, at [specific place], we reverently set forth the invocation rites.\"*\n\n**Humbly Invoking the Celestial Lords of the Seven Stars:**\nTwice bow to the **Venerable Lords of the Northern Dipper’s Seven Stars**.\n\nHumbly invoke:\n- The **Lord of the Greedy Wolf (贪狼) Star, the Yang-Ming Star**\n- The **Lord of the Great Gate (巨门) Star, the Yin-Precise Star**\n- The **Lord of the True Person (禄存) Star**\n- The **Lord of the Ending Return (末回) Star, the

**Seven Mansions of the West**:\n- **Kui (奎), Lou (娄), Wei (胃), Mao (昴), Bi (毕), Zui (觜), Shen (参) Star Officials**\n\nHumbly invoke the **Seven Mansions of the South**:\n- **Jing (井), Gui (鬼), Liu

Punishment (解刑)**, **Dispersion of Disasters (消灾)**, and **Scattering of Misfortune (散祸)**, that they may descend and partake in the ritual feast.\n\n*\"Your servant [name], prostrates and bows twice.\"*\n\nThen, kneeling, visualize the deities descending to the seat.\nOffer wine and incense **three times**.\n\nFinally, in a long kneel:\n*\"Your servant [name] humbly petitions...\"*\n\n**Supplication to the True Lord of the Northern Dipper (北斗七星真人府君) and the Star Officials (及诸星官)**\n\nYour servant, a mere mortal of low worth,\nWho has presumptuously partaken of

empty and false.\n\nPerhaps from my past lives’ karmic debts,\nOr from this life onward,\nI have accumulated the **qi** of calamitous harm,\nAnd fallen into many punishments—\n**Four Kills (四杀)** and **conjoined punishments (兼并)**,\n**Five Punishments (五刑)** and **Three Hills, Five Graves (三丘五墓)**,\n**Heavenly Yearly Punishments (天年岁杀)** and **Hanging Corpses, Six Calamities (悬尸六害)**,\n**Lonely

life and fate\nCannot be preserved whole.\n\nWithout the **Xuan (玄)***—Enlightenment’s salvation,\nI cannot be freed.\n\nYour servant, with utmost sincerity,\nPetitions for blessings and mercy,\nAnd thus arranges this **jiào (醮)** ritual,\nHoping for your benevolent acceptance.\n\nI humbly pray that the **Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper (北斗七星)**, the **True Lord within the Dipper (斗中真人)**, and the **Star Officials (某等星尊神)** of my lineage,\nMay receive my humble offerings\nAnd clearly grant my sincere supplication.\n\nYour servant, prostrates and bows twice.\nThree times, wine and incense are offered.\n\nYour servant now humbly petitions the **Northern Dipper Star Lords (北斗星君)**—\nIf this is a **human ritual feast (人醮)**,\nThen I invoke the name of that person.\n\nSince my birth, my heart and deeds have erred.\nI have either violated **rites and teachings (礼教)**,\nOr committed many acts of killing—\nBound by the **Four Records (四司)**, punished by the **Three Officials (三官)**,\nMy

(得诀)**,\nTheir resolve is like **piercing stone (志若穿石)**—\nThey do not **shift their practice (不移习)**,\nNor **cease their transformation (不休转)**,\nEven as the years deepen.\nWith **unwavering sincerity (至诚不退)**,\nThey are called **those who take the Dao with resolve (志心取道)**—\nThe Dao does not **fail such practitioners (道不负人)**.\n\nNowadays, people have **words without true hearts (有口无心)**,\nTheir **intentions are not sincere (用心不真)**,\nAnd **without the Dao, they lack spirit (非道无神)**.\nYet **those who seek the Dao with resolve (修学志道)**** attain clarity (生明)**,\nAnd **command

**perform these methods (不为诸法)**,\nExcept to **rescue others from illness (救人疾病)**—\nThen they **act without delay (之外不行)**.\"*\n\n**The Orthodox One of Later Saints (后圣君)** says:\n*\"The **Dao’s messengers (大道之使者)**,\nNone surpass the **Central Dipper (中斗)**—\nBelow, mortals call it the **Northern Dipper (北斗)**.\n\nIt has **nine visible stars (九星)**,\nAnd **two unseen stars (不见二星)**.\nAlways within the Dipper,\nOne star is named **Imperial Lord (帝尊)**—\nThis is the **recorder of virtues and sins (罚恶记善)**,\nAnd the **master of all stars (万星之主)**.\n\nThe scriptures say:\n*'The Central Dipper has nine stars,\nTwo stars unseen.\nOne star rules all celestial stars,\nServing the **Great Dao (大道)**,\nCalled **Imperial Lord (帝尊)**.*\n\nBut the **nine stars of the Nine Wilds (九野中星)**,\nExcluding the **Five Elements and Six Yang stars (五行六甲大星)**,\nAre all **Imperial Lord (帝尊)**’s single star’s **deputies (差为使)**—\nTheir **missions are very important (所主使也甚要)**.\n\nThe **First Star of Authority (执权一星)**,\nIs named **Jade Sovereign (玉帝)**—\nIt **rules all stars and lodges between heaven and earth (主天地之间星宿)**,\nThe **heavenly deities and earthly spirits (天神地只)**,\n**Human spirits, dragons, and ghosts (人神龙鬼)**,\nAnd **malevolent spirits and deceitful deities (精邪奸祆)**—\nAll are under this **Star Lord’s command (此星君所部主也)**.\n\nIf one has **meritorious deeds toward heaven, earth, and living beings (善功於天地人物)**,\nThis **Star Lord** governs them all.\nIf one has **meritorious deeds toward heaven, earth, and living beings (善功於天地人物)**,\nThis **Star Lord** commands the **Celestial Gate’s messengers (天关使者)**,\nTo **open the gate and report (关奏)**,\nAnd **petition the Jade Sovereign, the Great Dao’s Supreme Emperor (玉皇上帝道君)**,\nSo that **meritorious deeds are recorded (以善功立)**,\nAnd **grades are promoted through repeated transference (数迁阶进品禄)**—\nNot only **longevity and immortals (长生仙人)**,\nBut also **officials, generals, and common folk (世之官将人民)**,\nAll are under this **Star Lord’s governance (皆所主也)**.\n\nIf one commits **wicked and rebellious crimes (凶恶祆逆之罪)**,\nThis **Star Lord** also rules over them.\nThus, the **Celestial Gate’s messengers (天关使者)**,\nAccording to the **lightness or gravity of the crime (随罪轻重)**,\nMay **demote or execute (贬杀)**.\n\nThe **Celestial Gate (天关)** is the **high commander (上将)**.\nOne star is named **Jade Sovereign Lord (玉帝君)**—\nIt **supervises the gate’s reporting (上主关奏)**,\nAnd **petitions the Most High Boundless Dao Emperor (太上无极大道玉皇帝大道君)**.\nThus, all **Star Officials (众官)** call it the **Jade Sovereign Star Lord (玉帝星君)**.\nAs stated in the previous section.\n\n**Lao Jun (老君)** says:\n*\"To **transform the Celestial Gate (转天关)**,\nAnd **subdue the wicked and rebellious (伐凶逆)**,\nAnd **aid the nation and safeguard the people (助国安人)**—\nThis is the **method (法)**.\"*\n\nThe **Star General** first enters with the **Military Tiger Talisman (兵虎符)** into the **Hall of Tranquility (靖室)**, stepping upon the **Earthly Stems (地纪)** in forward, reversed, and inverted sequences—each three times—then invoking the **Celestial Rope (飞天纲)** three times.\nForward, reversed, and inverted—each three times.\nUpon completion, lower the Rope, disperse into **Yú’s Steps (禹步)**—three strides, nine traces—then reverse into twelve steps, and again into fifteen steps. Beneath the Rope, align with the **clothing talisman (配衣)**, the left hand seizing the **Military Talisman (出军符)** to **transform the Celestial Gate (转天关)**.\nWith the **Nine Fingers (九指)**, point at the **rebellious traitors of the realm (逆国贼)** and their cohorts. Shout their names—\nIf near, the voice is small; if many, adjust accordingly.\nThen recite the incantation:\n*\"Wicked and rebellious [name], you rebel against the Sovereign,\nGathering demonic bands, stealing and plundering wealth,\nSlaying innocent folk.\nThe Most High does not permit this—\nGreat evil, great wrath!\nCommand the **Celestial Gate’s messengers (勑消转斗关津)**,\nThreefold with the Nine Fingers,\nTo annihilate [name]’s band—\nAll prohibitions, by oral decree, are now enforced.\nI command my ministers to act—\nTransform and subdue, kill.\nAs the Law decrees, swiftly.\"*\n\n**Pinch the blade talisman (捻刀支诀)**, the formula aligned with the **Five Phases calculations (五方算)**—\n*\"Eastward, the Wooden Man’s blade talisman—so be it.\"*\nWithin one day, invoke the Nine Fingers three times.\nDo not exceed one hundred days—\nThe traitors will self-destruct.\nThis method is **wondrously efficacious**.\nIn antiquity, **Yellow Stone (黄石姿)** taught it to **Jiang Ziya (太公姜子牙)**, and it proved most effective.\nLater, **Jiang Ziya** did not pass this method down.\nThe formula remains in the subsequent annotations.\n\n**Lao Jun** says:\n*\"Humans are born of the **Five Phases (五行)**,\nBeginning their fate with the **Six Jia (六甲)**—\nThere is flourishing and decline.\nWhen flourishing, the **Southern Dipper (南斗)** governs;\nWhen declining, the **Northern Dipper (北斗)** governs.\nThe Southern Dipper’s six stars—hence, **Six Jia**.\nThe Northern Dipper’s seven stars—hence, **Seven Mansions (七宿)**.\nThe Southern Dipper presides over life; the Northern Dipper, over death—\nThus, life and death belong to the **Two Dippers’ jurisdiction**.\nIf one commits wicked deeds, the **Northern Dipper’s Celestial Finger (天指)** turns against them.\nHuman flourishing and decline are all under the **Two Dippers’ scrutiny**.\nIf evil deeds accumulate to their limit, Heaven must punish—\nThen the **Southern Dipper records the name (落名)**,\nAnd the **Northern Dipper executes the form (斩形)**.\nAll human wickedness is slain by the **Northern Dipper**.\nNow, if one commits **Five Evils**—\nRebelling against the **Dao/Way**, betraying the teacher,\nBetraying the sovereign, betraying one’s father—\nHeaven knows this early.\nYet if there are those with **virtuous intent**,\nServing as sovereign or teacher,\nSubduing the wicked and rebellious,\nEradicating evil, upholding the **Rectified Way (正道)**,\nAnd bringing peace to all—\nTheir merit is vast and enduring.\nThe Most High rejoices, elevating them to **Celestial Officials (仙官)**,\nSharing governance of the **Ten Heavens (十天)**,\nAscending to the **Supreme Clarity’s True Emperor (上清太真之位)**.\nOther rites may save one’s family—\nBut this rite’s use is for **national salvation**.\nEmploy talismans and methods as prescribed.\n\n**Lao Jun** instructs **Sìmìng (司命)** and his attendants:\n*\"In antiquity, **Sìmìng** was an attendant of the **Sovereign Lord (隶君)**—\nNot the later **Sìmìng**.\nNow, **Han Jun (韩君)** has replaced him—\nThis is his station.\nThe **Central Dipper (中斗)**, along with the **Southern and Northern Dippers**,\nThese three Dippers are upright—\nThey do not meddle without cause, bringing chaos.\nIf one petitions for blessings but instead invites calamity,\nThe **learners of the Dao** must first **know themselves** above all.\nIn days past, there was a **student of the Dao**, **Guō Shēngzǐ (郭声子)**,\nWho burned incense day and night, worshipping the **Northern Dipper** without cease.\nFor seventeen years, the **Northern Dipper Lord** pursued and reproached him:\n*'I, the Northern Dipper, am an **Inspector of Virtue and Vice (纠察之官)**,\nUpright in enforcing the Law.\nDay and night, I patrol the Nine Heavens.\nIf any star or constellation commits good or evil,\nI know first—\nThen I report to the **Celestial Sovereign (上帝)**.\nThe Sovereign frequently commands **Celestial Messengers and Daoist Officials (天使仙官)**,\nTo investigate and inspect, lest there be **unjust favoritism**.\nWe, the **Nine Inspectors (九司)**, always fear punishment for ourselves.\nWho are you, so base and ignorant,\nBurning incense nightly, publicly announcing to Heaven—\nWhat do you seek?\nYour actions have unsettled all nine stars.\nNow, your deeds disturb the **Five Phases above**,\nAnd alarm the **Twenty-Eight Constellations below**—\nAll have gathered to question me:\n*\"This man is harmless—\nWhy does he, through licentiousness and chaos,\nDraw the **Celestial Inspectors’ scrutiny**?\nWhy not kill him first, then report?\"*\nBecause you are but a mortal, I spare you—\nNot that I harbor malice.\nBut now, bow and apologize.\nYour crimes are threefold:\nFirst, **false invocation**—\nWithout illness or misfortune, you petition the **Celestial Gate (天关)**,\nDemanding the **Gate’s messengers (转关使者)** punish some person or thing.\nSecond, you **burn incense endlessly**,\nWorshipping the Northern Dipper from afar—\nI fear the **Chen Star (辰星)** will accuse me,\nClaiming I **privately accepted your offerings**.\nThird, the **Female Star of the Northern Dipper (北斗女星君)** is of **serene and chaste nature**—\nTo **wrongfully harm her** would invite retribution upon your lineage.\nAnd the **Northern Dipper’s Imperial Lord (北斗帝尊君)**,\nAs well as the **Jade Sovereign Star Lord (玉帝君)**—\nThese two stars are upright and difficult to offend.\nNow, I release you—\nBut never repeat this folly.\"*\nGuō Shēngzǐ was spared and lived again,\nBut died five days later.\nHis kin asked why—\nHe never spoke.\nLater, this was recorded in the **Ritual Texts of the Seven Stars and Twenty-Eight Constellations (醮七星及二十八宿文仪)**,\nTo warn future generations.\nIf one faces **urgent peril**—\nSurrounded by bandits, harassed by officials,\nOr stricken with grave illness—\nAfter petitioning, step upon the **Celestial Rope (纲)** and tread the **Earthly Stems (蹑纪)**,\nTransform the **Celestial Gate (转天关)**,\nAnd dispel the calamity—\nIt poses no hindrance and is **swift as water or fire**.\nThe **Later Sage Sovereign (后圣君)** told **Dàwáng Jūn (大王君)**:\n*\"The **Central and Northern Dippers**,\nIf invoked in **genuine distress**, will respond.\nBut **false petitions** bring ruin.\nRefer to the previous annotations.\nThose who cultivate the **Supreme Dao (至道)** with sincerity,\nFirst **aid the nation and benefit the people**—this is paramount.\nIf the realm is not purified, **demonic qi (妖气)** lingers.\nIf the people are not at peace, the **Dao cannot prevail**.\nIf one’s practice of the Dao fails,\nThis is not the heart of a **true Daoist.\"**\n\nThis too is the words of **Lǎojūn (老君)**.\n\nIn ancient times, **Fúxià Zǐ (伏夏子)**, the younger brother of **Fúxī (伏牺)**, cultivated the **Dao/Way** and attained immortality. While studying in the mortal realm, he took a small bamboo flute and blew it, imitating the **Fèng (凤)** phoenix’s voice—this is the origin of the **shēng (笙)**.\n\nA **celestial immortal** descended to observe him. Afterward, the immortal informed **Fúxià Zǐ**:\n*\"You are in danger of military calamity.\"*\n\n**Fúxià Zǐ** rose and bowed twice, then asked how to avert the military peril. The immortal replied:\n*\"You may use **Lónghuí (龙回)**, which is the step of the **Earthly Stems (蹑地纪)** method for breaking formations. **Hǔtiào (虎跳)** is the step of the **Fēigāng (飞钢)** today. **Yǐnxīng (引星)** corresponds to the **configuring of ritual garments (配衣)** now. **Zhuǎnshā (转杀)** is done at the fingertips—this is the **Celestial Gate (转天关)** of today. **Cóngjī xiànghuài (从基向坏)** refers to the **foundational alignment (即今之日月建地)** and its **dissolution (即今之日破地)**.\n\nThe strategies of martial masters for calculating **isolated and empty formations (孤虚)** resemble these methods, and they are highly reliable. Those of old who were **divine sages (神人)** all employed them. When used correctly, they yield victory.\n\nAfter **Fúxià Zǐ** learned these methods, he used them to rescue those in **genuine distress (急难)** who practiced the **Dao/Way**. **Lǎojūn (老君)** said:\n*\"For **Daoist companions (道友)** and **inner kin (内亲)**, surrounded by bandits and facing annihilation—if one can devise a plan to save them, they should employ the **Earthly Stems (金地纪)** method in motion: forward, backward, and reverse, three times. Then configure the ritual garments (**配衣**), turn the **Celestial Gate (转天关)**, and ninefoldly point with the fingers (**指之**). Additionally, grasp the **military talisman (兵符)**, pointing it nine times. Twist the **bandit’s command (贼某命人刀支)**—the **Sword-Support (刀支)** of the **wood-directional bandit (东来木人)** is marked with **metallic-white (金白)**, the **gold-directional bandit (西来金人)** with **flaming-red (火赤)**, the **water-directional bandit (南来水人)** with **earthly-yellow (土黄)**, the **fire-directional bandit (北来火人)** with **water-black (水黑)**, and the **earth-directional bandit (四季上来者土人)** with **bamboo-green (木青)**. The four seasons are represented by **chén, xuǔ, chǒu, wèi (辰戌丑未)**.\n\nWhen twisting the **Sword-Support (刀支)**, use the hand corresponding to its direction. Then, apply the color as described. Afterward, take out the **military talisman (兵符)** and point it nine times at a distance. The bandits’ resolve will collapse, and they will retreat, lifting the siege without harming your **inner kin (反亲)**. If they refuse to retreat, the **shadow army (阴军)** will strike them, and they will mutually slaughter and destroy each other until none remain.\n\nThis method is subtle and of utmost secrecy—do not reveal it to anyone unworthy.\n\nThe **Later Sage Sovereign (后圣君)** told the **Celestial Master (天师)**:\n*\"This talisman is for military use—both to aid the nation in battle and to rescue **Daoist companions (道友)** and one’s own life. There is a talisman, the **Tiger King Talisman (虎王符)**, forged from **gold and copper (金铜)**, measuring either two inches or one and a half inches. The **Celestial Master (本师)** must consecrate and empower it. Then, store it in a **brocade pouch (锦袋)**, ensuring no one ever sees it. Only four may behold it: the **Celestial Master (本师)** and the **protector of the Master (保举师)**. If the protector fails or is struck down remotely, the talisman’s power will vanish, and it will never be seen again. The second category includes **sovereigns receiving subjects (君受臣)** and **subjects receiving sovereigns (臣受君)**. The third are **fathers receiving sons (父受子)** and **sons receiving fathers (子受父)**. The fourth are **husbands and wives (夫妻)**. Others must never see it.\n\nIf **Daoist companions (道友)** or **inner kin (内亲)** wish to carry it for healing, seal it tightly and give it to the sick person. The illness will immediately abate. If the sick person secretly examines it, the illness will flare up, and they will die without fail.\n\n**Out-Military Talisman (出军)**\nIf one personally leads an army and is besieged, and the troops break through the enemy’s formation, the talisman must be tied to the **left elbow (左肘)**. There is another talisman, the **White Tiger Talisman for Breaking Strong Formations (白虎破强阵符)**, also forged from **gold and copper (金铜)**, measuring one and a half inches. Its method of use is the same as the previous talisman’s annotations. All talismans are cast from **gold and copper (金铜)**—the **in-military talisman (入军符)** is tied to the **left elbow (左)**, and the **out-military talisman (出军符)** to the **right elbow (右)**.\n\nTogether with the **ritual postures and prohibitions (并式禁制)**, and the **spirit of the talisman (加临相助)**, one will inevitably achieve victory. The enemy will collapse like a mountain—this is highly effective. Do not reveal it to anyone unworthy.\n\n**Lǎojūn (老君)** said:\n*\"In ancient times, the **Western Hu (西胡)** had a great king who loved the **Dao/Way**. I instructed him through the **Hu Immortal (胡仙)**, and he changed his name to **Fó (佛)**—a different name for **celestial immortal (仙)**. The Hu called him **Fó**.\n\nThe Four **Celestial Realms (天国)** did not submit, each fielding **strong armies (强兵)** of four hundred thousand men. They surrounded this king’s realm, layer upon layer. The king begged for deliverance but refused to comply. His **true heart (正心)** and **sincere intent (思存)** were evident—I saw him in the void, calling for my aid.\n\nI used the **Earthly Stems (蹑地纪)** to scatter radiance, the **Yǔbù (禹步)** to turn the **Celestial Gate (关)**, and pointed three times. Then, I released a **military talisman (出军一符)** toward the Hu king’s desk. The king saw it, tied it to his **left elbow (左手肘)**, and later opened the city gates to battle. Those who fought against this king all fell backward, and the enemy armies were utterly defeated, slaughtered by the city’s defenders.\n\nIn but a moment, the **heavens and earth (天地)** grew enraged, and thunderous winds shook the heavens and earth. White rain descended, annihilating the Four **Celestial Armies (天军)**. The armies and their king scattered and fled back to their own lands, unharmed in their positions.\n\nThus, the **virtue/power (力)** of this talisman is supreme. Guard it carefully—do not let anyone unworthy see it. If they do, both parties will face retribution, and the **Heaven’s great wrath (天大威)** will bring death. This is no trivial matter—be cautious, be cautious.\n\n**The Method of the Red Chapter for Aiding the Nation and Subduing Bandits (赤章助国伐贼法)**\n**Tàishàng Lǎojūn (太上老君)** said:\n*\"Rescue is the **virtue/power (功)** of aiding the nation in subduing bandits, saving the nation from difficulty. When **kings and emperors (国王帝主)** dispatch great ministers to attack rebellious bandits, but are instead besieged—if one is a **master of martial law (掌法)** and a **true Daoist (志道之人)**, they should aid the nation in its salvation.\n\nUse the **Red Chapter (上赤章)** to summon the **Heavenly Armies (天兵)**, turn the **Celestial Gate (转天关)** to rescue them—swift as water or fire in urgency. If the nation’s strong bandits retreat, with neither side harmed, this is the highest outcome.\n\nIf the bandits are **strong and unyielding (强梁不伏)**, petition the **Heavenly Sovereign (天公)**—now called **Yùhuáng Dìshàng (玉皇上帝)**—and write their crimes. This is **Heaven’s retribution (天施功)**. If the **virtue/power (功)** is great and **Heaven does not strike (天不伐)**, the act of **subduing and killing (蹑杀)** will instead be recorded as the **hidden merit (阴功)** of saving people.\n\n**Nurturing and protecting all beings (安养人物)**.\nThis pleases **Heaven greatly (此天大喜)**, and **Heaven will devise a plan (与计)** for the **hidden merit (阴功)**.\n\nLater sages changed this to the **Red Chapter (赤章)**—a **chapter of petition against traitors (章奏反臣章)**—saying, *'Tàixuān Dū (泰玄都)' and so forth.\"*\n\nThe Sovereign humbly follows the written petition: *\"In such-and-such state and county, a certain person [X] has rebelled for such-and-such reason.*\n\nNow the state commands a certain minister [Y] to lead an army of tens of thousands of soldiers and horses to the border of such-and-such state, to attack the rebel forces numbering tens of thousands. Fearful that their troops are fierce, rebellious, and strong, recklessly slaughtering the innocent and resisting the righteous, refusing to submit, the minister now finds himself besieged within such-and-such city’s encampment, unable to escape, with his life hanging by a thread. He seeks the minister’s salvation.\n\nThe minister petitions for **Heavenly troops**: humbly requesting the descent of the **Nine Heavenly Great Mighty Gods**, the **Nine Great Generals**, with **ninety million soldiers**, to unite with the minister’s **talismanic army of ninety million**, summoning the **nine million earthly community temple troops** to secretly deploy and array themselves. When the minister’s [X] **sun-facing troops** sound the battle drum, the troops shall immediately strike in response, aiding in the assault against the rebels. Their fierce and treacherous forces shall collapse in an instant—like mountains crumbling to dust, or stones shattering—sand collapsing, deer fleeing, surrendering and clearing the path for the general’s forces to emerge victorious.\n\nFurther, the minister requests the **White Tiger Talisman**, commanding **19,000 officers and soldiers**, capable of subduing vast armies, whose might shakes Heaven and Earth, whose strength can uproot mountains and drain the seas, to assist the minister [Y] and the general in striking down the rebels.\n\nLater, the **Sage Sovereign** instructed the **Heavenly Master**: *\"You must act with discernment. If he is truly a rebel against the sovereign, then proceed. If not, do not. Be cautious.\"*\n\n「Do not rashly grant this military authority, lest the blame fall upon yourself.\n\nThe Heavenly Master said: *\"The Dao/Way has no impossibilities; act as your heart dictates.\"* Yet, one must first gauge human intent and measure the feasibility of action, lest there be reckless deeds. When dealing with those whose **志 (aspirations)** align with yours and who are **志道友 (friends in the Dao/Way)**, if they wish to submit this petition, they must first assess that neither the petitioner nor themselves hold any faults, and only then may they present it to the Sage Sovereign.\n\nIf the petitioner has faults, and others appear faultless, one must not involve themselves, lest they too incur greater faults. This is the case when two individuals inform Heaven of their own wrongdoings, and the punishment is swift—within moments, disciples may rebel against their teacher, or teachers may invoke the **灵官 (Spiritual Official)** to petition against their own students.\n\nThis petition is originally recorded in the *Dà Zhāng Yí* [Great Ritual Code], now further inscribed here for reference. The Sage Sovereign summons the **Spiritual Official** to subdue disciples and malevolent commoners who, through **孤恩 (isolated kindness)** and **负道 (betraying the Dao/Way)**, invoke the Spiritual Official to dissolve the petition and restore illness—just as in the original petition.\n\nThe *Zá Zhāng Yí* [Miscellaneous Ritual Code] contains this, so it is not written again; its contents have already been listed.\n\n**Issuing Talismans and Ritual Edicts to Restrain the Three Officials’ Malevolent Forces**\n\nAmong the **三官 (Three Officials)**—Heaven, Earth, and Water—there are malevolent forces and malevolent individuals: **神龙 (Divine Dragons)**, **鬼精 (Ghostly Spirits)**, and **妖 (demons)** are such.\n\nThe Heavenly Master said: *\"The petitioner is **罗文能强 (Luo Wen Nengqiang)**.\"* His surname is **罗 (Luo)**, his given name is **文能 (Wen Neng)**, and his courtesy name is **强 (Qiang)**.\n\n*\"As for mortals, they are the most honored among the **三才 (Three Powers)**—Heaven, Earth, and Humanity. All things of reverence place their weight upon the human body and seek to nurture its nature. One must always ponder the Dao/Way’s principles and safeguard one’s life and vitality.**\n\n**存师 (Preserve the teacher), 想道 (contemplate the Dao/Way).**\n**存金箓之师 (Preserve the teacher of the Golden Seal).**\nThe teacher of the Golden Seal refers to the **度师 (Master of Initiation)** from the *Jīnsuǒ Liúzhū* [Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl]. The Golden Seal’s Dao/Way was later reformed by the Sage Sovereign into the *Jīnsuǒ Liúzhū* [Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl].\n\nIn the **上古 (Ancient Times)**, the **真人 (Sage)** revered the Golden Seal talisman and honored the Golden Seal Master of Initiation. The Divine Soldiers of the Golden Seal would summon with a **咄叱 (commanding cry)**, dispersing ghosts and spirits, and the talismans would drive away malevolent forces, always saving lives. These are my disciples.\n\nThis talisman, the **玄孙符计 (arcane inheritance of talismans and strategies)**, is used to defend oneself and others, making it easy to attain merit. Later, one will attain the Dao/Way and become a **上等真人 (highest rank of Sage)**.\n\n**Do not rely on mere sound (声).**\nSound refers to the chanting of scriptures, reciting praises during fasting rituals, and the murmurs of Dao/Way contemplation. **Do not rely on mere images (像).**\nImages refer to statues in halls of reverence, official shrines, and temple deities—all part of the **像教 (teaching through images)**.\n\nIf one can abandon **有为 (worldly pursuits)** and instead turn their heart inward toward the **至道 (Ultimate Dao/Way)**, practicing the silent, ineffable teachings, advancing through **阴功 (hidden merit)**, and refining their conduct, they will attain **无为之德 (the virtue of non-action)** and achieve the Dao/Way.\n\nMy Dao/Way is entirely based on **行阴德 (practicing hidden virtue)**, borrowing **阴功 (hidden merit)** to fulfill its requirements. When merit is complete and the Dao/Way is realized, my teachings are passed on, and when the **年劫数 (age and kalpa)** are fulfilled, all receive this transmission based on their **因师 (karmic connection with the teacher)**.\n\nAfter receiving it, do not rashly transmit to unworthy individuals. In the world, there are **贤达 (virtuous and enlightened)** individuals who, trusting in gold and jade, will pass it on. The Heavenly Master instructed those of good conduct among the Sages:\n\n*\"If one’s aspirations align with the teachings and the recipient is virtuous yet lacks faith, then one must rely on their own sincerity. If the recipient’s struggles and joys are understood, then one may transmit to them, provided that the teacher and disciples together fulfill the required offerings. Then, one may inform Heaven and be granted the transmission—do not sever the path of Heaven’s Dao/Way.*\n\n*\"If the recipient is virtuous but lacks wealth, the teacher and disciples may assist in providing offerings before transmission. One must not transmit without faith, nor must one transmit to those who are not virtuous and enlightened simply because they possess wealth or treasures. If one accepts wealth and transmits recklessly, both teacher and disciple will die, and Heaven will punish them for revealing its treasures.*\n\n**慎之慎之 (Be cautious, be cautious).\"**\n\nEnd of the **Second Scroll of the *Jīnsuǒ Liúzhū* [Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl] Ritual Edicts.**\nBegin the **Twenty-Third Scroll of the *Jīnsuǒ Liúzhū* [Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl] Ritual Edicts.**\n\nThe **Grand Sovereign of the Celestial Masters of China**, **Zǎiwáng Fāngpíng Zhāng Dàolíng**, along with **Zhào Shēng, Wáng Cháng, Sīmìng Lǐ Zhòngfǔ, Máoyíng, Xǔ Yùfǔ**, and others, compiled and transmitted this across generations.\n\n**Lǐ Chúnfēng**, the Daoist Sage of China, annotated the **Method of Writing Talismans, Exorcising Evil, and Treating Illnesses**.\n\nThe **Most High Lord Lao** spoke to **Luò Tiānshī**, saying:\n*\"If you wish to perform hidden merit, nothing surpasses granting talismans. The highest merit is to heal demonic illnesses—saving one person earns the merit of ten. For those afflicted by demonic illness enter households, disturbing both people and things. When one falls ill, they can disrupt an entire village, tormenting ten households. Thus, saving ten earns tenfold merit.\n\nBy severing the vital essence of demonic ghosts, spirits, and malevolent *qi*, their lives are not taken as punishment but as merit earned.\n\nLater, the **Sage Emperor** spoke to **Zhang Tiānshī**, saying:\n*'When you treat people’s illnesses and their afflictions are cured, if the demon is condemned to be slain, it is not a crime but merit earned. If it was not a demon but you recklessly issued a summons and executed it, you risk inviting disaster—this would be a grave and unjust offense. You, teacher and disciples, must pass on the teaching with caution and never do such things. My Dao has no pardon for this.*\n\n**Laozi** said:\n*'To prohibit and restrain celestial foxes so they no longer torment humans and Heaven, you must obtain the name of the afflicted person. Then, pinch the celestial demon’s eye—even celestial foxes can be captured.\n\nThe eyes of celestial beasts include those of the **celestial tiger, celestial dog, celestial ox, celestial leopard, celestial fox**, and other beasts.*\n\nThe **Sage Emperor** said:\n*'Celestial beasts such as the **qílín, shīzǐ (lion), and the twelve *gāngfēng* (wind-riding) steeds** are known in the world as the hundred and six *chén* (dusts). Six-legged beasts—such as the **celestial deer, celestial sheep, celestial monkey**, and others—number three hundred and sixty, too many to list individually. All these beasts have secret talismanic eyes and blade-seals (*juédāo zhī*), recorded in the *Seventh Scroll of the Flowing Pearl* under the name *Zhǎngjué* (Palm Seals). These seals and blade-seals can bind and sever all beasts, preventing them from inflicting illness upon humans.\n\nIf demonic *qi* lingers within a person’s body, first administer the **Swallowing Demon-Illness Talisman** for twenty-one, twenty-eight, or thirty-five days, wearing the talisman and summons. There is no case where this fails to permanently cure and sever the affliction. These talismans are found in the *Three Sections of Miscellaneous Talismans*.\n\nIf demonic spirits have knowledge of divine communication, they will retreat and dare not return to torment.\n\nFor those who are stubborn, wicked, and refuse to accept the Dao’s teachings, you may **tread the *Dìjì* (Earth Memorization) three times**, recite the **Reversed, Inverted, and Flying Heavenly Ropes three times**, and take **Yǔbù (Great Flood Steps) three steps with nine traces**. Upon completion, transform the three steps into twelve steps—there is an illustration of this in the earlier scrolls.\n\nThen, **adjust the clothing**: with your left hand, point to the **Heavenly Middle Magic King’s Palace**, invoking the **Golden-Copper Dragon Talisman of the Heavenly Messengers**, and with your right hand, grasp and summon it. Nine times, this talisman transforms into a **ten-thousand-*zhàng* dragon**, rushing to the **Heavenly Bureau of Demons’ Palace** to seize celestial foxes and beasts, swift as water and fire.\n\nRegarding the **Decisive Rod**, the scripture states:\n*'Celestial foxes need not be killed—merely strike them twenty times, bind them, and send them to the Eastern Sea, where the Water Official will detain them for ten, five, fifteen, or twenty years, depending on the judgment of the summoned master.*\n\nThe decree states:\n*'Bind and restrain these celestial foxes. Those who violate this prohibition will be punished accordingly. After binding, send them to the Water Official for detention of so many years.*\n\nThe **Sage Emperor** spoke to **Tiānshī**, saying:\n*'When treating the illnesses of the common people, you must always enforce prohibitions, measuring the lightness or severity of their offenses before passing judgment. Judgment should spare the ghosts and spirits, lest they suffer grievously. If they suffer grievously, they may lose their original forms—how much more so if they seek rebirth among humans, taking on human bodies!*\n\nAccording to the *Sūtra on Causes and Conditions of Birth and Death*, these ghostly spirits are already discontented in their forms, yet they further harm and torment others. When summoned by a Daoist master and found guilty, they should be condemned to death but not executed on the spot. If their poisonous *qi* remains unresolved and they are slain, they will transform into venomous snakes, taking a thousand years to escape their serpentine form, only to be reborn as poultry or dogs among humans—having never attained a human life.\n\nYou must refrain from binding and restraining others in this manner. Over time, as the months and years pass, they will naturally regret their actions, confess their guilt, and seek release. In dreams, they may warn and guide others to find them, allowing them to depart for another world. After fulfilling their term as ghosts, they may be reborn into human life—but only as lowly, impoverished beings. How could they ever become noble?\n\nYou must remember my words and **never recklessly issue talismans or summonses**.\n\nHe also said:\n*'Talismans are merely the假威力 (*jiǎ wēilì*—false authority) of the Dao, used to pacify and sever demonic spirits so they do not harm people and things. Summonses are curses—using the Dao’s authority to admonish and scold spirits, preventing them from causing mischief. You must practice this well. If done correctly, it brings merit; if done recklessly, it brings guilt.*\n\n**Laozi addressed the Thirty-Three Heavenly Imperial Lords** in the *Sūtra on Guiding Beings Across*:\n\n*'There are thirty-two heavens—why does this differ from other scriptures? The four directions, each with eight heavens, make thirty-two, excluding the Central Heaven. Now, including the Central Heaven, there are thirty-three Heavenly Imperial Lords—this is the correct count.\n\nThe **Primordial Heavenly Venerable** possesses **eighty-four thousand golden talismans** and the same number of jade talismans. He is called the **Elemental Sovereign, Most Sacred Great Dao Lord**.\n\nThe **Most High Great Dao Lord** has **twelve thousand golden talismans** and the same number of jade talismans. He is called the **Master of Ten Thousand Dao**.\n\nThe **Most High Lord Lao** also has **twelve thousand golden talismans** and the same number of jade talismans. He is called the **Emperor of the Void, Great Dao, Jade Dawn**, and is known as the **Former Sage**.\n\nWhen the **Supreme Lord Lao** ascended, he was titled the **Pacified Heavenly Golden Gate Jade Dawn Later Sage, Primordial Supreme Dao Lord**. As recorded in the *Taiping Jing*, he is also called the **Jade Emperor of Heaven**.\n\nAdditionally, the *Jīnquè Yùjīng* states:\n*'The Supreme Lord Lao bears the surname **Lǐ** and given name **Ēr**, with the courtesy name **Bóyáng**.\"*\n\nThe **Lord Lao’s Manifested Form** also. The records state: *\"Later Body.\"* He ascended to the **Supreme Pure Dao Lord’s station**, with hair and beard as white as frost, clad in luminous jade robes. His rank surpassed that of the Later Sage, and he was honored as the **Jade Emperor**. In the Dao, he is invoked as the **Jade Emperor of Heaven**; in the secular world, as the **Heavenly Patriarch Emperor**.\n\nHe holds **thirteen thousand golden talismans**—originally meant to be four thousand, but the Later Sage Lord declined them, thus elevating the **Primordial Supreme Venerable’s station**. The jade talismans match in number. The **Heavenly Sovereign Lord** has three thousand golden talismans, with the same in jade. The **Celestial Master Lord** likewise holds three thousand golden talismans, with the same in jade. For lesser **True Immortals and High Ascetics**, their allotment is set at three hundred, two hundred, or one hundred talismans.\n\nThe **Lord of Life and Records** holds thirty-six talismans. The **Chief Examiners and Summoners of the Orthodox Law**—and the **Nine Regions’ Examiners and Summoners of the Law**—hold the rank of **Orthodox Teachers**, each granted thirty-six talismans. Their distribution follows the ranks of the **Peripatetic Saints**, with talismans assigned according to station; none may reveal them lightly.\n\nThe Later Sage Lord declared to the **Great King Lord**:\n*\"The Chief Examiners and Summoners of the Orthodox Law are granted thirteen additional talismans, totaling forty-nine—thirteen added to the original twenty-six.\"* Their names are recorded in the *Removal of the Residence* scroll. When distributing talismans in the amount of nine, they must be forged in gold and bronze, and carried by those afflicted with severe illness or grave misfortune—such talismans drive out disease. In military applications, they are sealed in multiple layers of brocade pouches before being given to others. **Never let them be seen by others**, for if viewed, their divine efficacy vanishes. Their nature is direct yet harsh, and their form is coarse and ominous—such that they should not be exposed.\n\nThe manifestations of divine powers upon seeing [the talismans] are fierce and boundless in the sky, yet they harm the afflicted—those whose ailments flare up and cannot be endured. **Beware, beware.**\n\nThe disciples of **Upper Clarity Three Pure** may be granted seven talismans and five methods. **Lingbao** may be granted six talismans, and **Orthodox Unity Alliance威** five. If the **Law of the Three Elements and Six Methods** is the supreme method of the world, one may, according to the **Precepts of the Most High Lord Lao**, be granted thirty-six talismans. The **Later Sage Lord’s Law** grants forty-nine talismans. These are to be bestowed according to the rank and seniority of the Daoist officials—**none may recklessly receive or practice them**, for heaven and earth forbid it.\n\nIn ancient times, **Ge Xuan**, the original master, received ten golden talismans of the **Abundant Dao**, using wooden tablets to inscribe spells and deceive the world. He also forged talismans of gold and bronze, imprinting them on paper to perform magic, killing ghosts and spirits, and bewitching people with transformations—his misdeeds were countless. The **Netherworld reported him to the Celestial Bureau**, which then petitioned the **Most High Later Sage Lord**, who condemned his great evil, demoting him two ranks and granting only the **Way of Immortality**. Because his Dao was false, it brought no benefit to mortals, and in truth, it harmed ghosts. Later scholars must be cautious and not follow his example.\n\nFor matters such as **using talismans to heal illness, protect the body, suppress malevolence, avert disaster, and dispel omens**, all methods must be properly observed.\n\nThe **Most High Lord Lao** said:\n*\"Those who practice Daoist methods are called Daoists or revered masters, yet they must abandon these titles. If they teach commoners or officials how to write talismans without proper authorization, recklessly inscribing and distributing them without purpose, they do not even mention the **shrine officials or divine offices**, nor do they know if those who wear the talismans truly believe. Such talismans are mere **precise counterfeit deceptions**—mere **shrine records without substance**. If they are but inked paper or old scraps, how could they cure disease? Such men, who falsely claim to be Daoists, are truly pitiful and lamentable.\"*\n\nThe first three or five lines are the words of the **Most High Lord Lao**; the rest are spoken by **Lu Tianxiang**.\n\n**Talismans and warrants** must specify the number of talismans issued, the destination (e.g., *\"to the household of so-and-so to heal illness\"*), and the time limit. When finished, report to the **Right Community and Soil Deity**, sending them along with the person.\n\nAfter recording the year, month, day, and hour, the warrant summons a certain official Daoist master to act.\n\n**Lu Tianxiang** said:\n*\"I received the oral precepts of the Most High Lord Lao. When giving talismans to others, one must have a **warrant of authority** and seal them properly. The warrant is what we now call the **authorization**. After issuing it, one must recite the **Sealing Ghosts Incantation** twice while stepping on the **Earth’s Veins**, and chant the following three times:*\n\n**‘Most High Lord Lao, born before Heaven and Earth.\nIlluminated by the Nine Qi, he dispels all spirits.\nThe shrine deities tremble—living without form.\nThe dead assume false names.\nThey do not appear in the Ghost Register, yet they must be executed.\nUpon receiving this warrant, reveal your true form!\nThough you are but a mountain ghost, you shall not wrongfully harm the sick.\nCease harming Daoist citizen [Name], and swiftly return their **three souls and seven spirits**.\nWear your true form, as decreed by the Most High.\nUrgent, as the Law commands.’**\n\nAfter chanting this incantation, the talisman’s efficacy is proven. If the illness is caused by a malevolent spirit, the patient shall recover upon speaking the words. Only then may one be called a **Communing-with-Spirits Daoist** and seek immortality.\"\n\n**Lu Tianxiang** further said:\n*\"I see Daoists in the world who cannot even heal their own illnesses, yet they still prescribe medicines for others—how much more absurd is it that they would dare to heal others? Such men still dare to seek the Dao of Immortality—how laughable and pitiful they are!\"*\n\n**Methods for healing illness, suppressing ghosts, and issuing warrants to banish malevolent spirits** are outlined in the *Precepts of the Most High Lord Lao’s Golden Mouth and Jade Statutes*:\n\n*\"The Precepts govern the righteous and suppress the wicked, subdue spirits, and aid humanity. The **Golden Statutes** contain **three hundred and sixty precepts**, and the **Jade Statutes** have **thirty volumes and fifteen thousand conditions**. They regulate gods, humans, dragons, and ghosts—**precise spirits, demons, and malevolent qi**—and impose punishments without leniency.\n\nThe **Jade Statutes** originally comprised fifteen thousand conditions, divided into sixty volumes. Now, from these sixty volumes, I have selected the **thirty-six essential incantations and methods**, recorded in the ninth section, to be used in **saving people, suppressing ghosts, and issuing warrants**.\n\nThe **warrants** within these conditions are used to **command celestial and earthly deities**, arrest and interrogate, and judge the guilt or innocence of spirits and humans—**to establish merit, protect the living, and suppress malevolent forces**.\n\n**First**, the method for **national defense against evil**—against wicked humans and malevolent ghosts—is to issue a **warrant to the local territorial deity**, beginning with:\n*'Consider and summon the Daoist master. Warrant to [Name] of [Mountain/Region] and [Divine Official], etc. The name of the deity must be specified.'*\n\nThe warrant states:\n*'Regarding the case of [Name], a resident of [County/Region], who has committed [Crime] at [Location], etc.'*\n\nThis follows the format of **official state documents**, but the concluding clause must read:\n*'By law, this warrant is issued to [Shrine/Deity]. It does not state \"investigation required.\"'* For the **Most High Lord Lao’s methods**, only the word **\"Law\"** is used.\n\n**Second**, the method for **suppressing ghosts afflicting the sick**—for minor spirits—is to issue a warrant to the **shrine deity and the household deity**, permanently prohibiting their interference. It reads:\n*'Consider and summon the Daoist master. Warrant to [County] Duji [Shrine].\nToday, Lu Tianxiang first adds the **City God Official**.\nReceived from the commoners or officials—specify their names.\nThe petition states:\n*\"[Name], male or female, suffers from [Illness].\nSince [Year/Month/Day], the illness has worsened, with signs of malevolent qi clinging to the body, unresolved despite all treatments.\nNow, with sincere devotion, I rely on the Great Dao to heal and suppress the ghostly bandits.\nI humbly request your judgment.\"*\n\n**Translation:**\n\n*\"Consider and summon the Daoist master*—now sealed and presented to the Jade Emperor of Heaven, requesting a change in the title of the summoned Daoist master to **‘Summoning Righteous Envoy’**, so that all ghosts and spirits of the land may know and submit.\n\nThe judgment reads as follows:\n\nOnce the judgment is complete, it is stated:\n*'According to the law, a **Day-Symbol Official** must be dispatched to issue a warrant and pursue the malevolent ghost-bandits, with the following decree:\n\nFor grave offenses, it shall decree **‘beheaded’**; for lesser offenses, **‘a hundred strokes’**. The afflicted shall be confined and ordered to recover within a set number of days.\n\nAfter reporting upward, it is further stated:\n\nOn the [Year/Month/Day/Hour], the **Day-Symbol Official** Zhao Rui issued the warrant.\n\nZhao Rui was the son of **Zhao Sheng**, a disciple of **Zhang the Daoist Master** during the reign of Emperor An of Han. Having perfected his Daoist studies, he mastered countless prohibitive arts, yet never used them to kill humans. Instead, he employed them as a jest within human affairs. He casually hunted and executed ghosts and spirits, though he did not consider saving the sick his merit. Often, he would slaughter malevolent spirits and spirits of snakes, insects, dragons, tigers, and leopards—killing them in droves.\"*\n\n「He could command the rivers to cease their flow, make orange trees bloom with flowers and leaves, and walk upon water as if on land. He would weave reeds into boats and ferry dozens of people across the river—no more. When people were in the water, the boats appeared as real vessels to them; yet once they reached the riverbank, the boats were merely reed leaves.\n\nDuring the reigns of Emperor Xuan and Emperor Cheng, he was highly esteemed. He was ennobled as a **Hardy Marquis** (硕侯), and the Princess of Xianyang was married to him. His title was further elevated to **Heroic** (雄) and **Efficacious** (用). For over seventy years, he enslaved the ghosts and spirits of the world without cease. The **Dao-spirits** (鬼神) grew resentful and their grievances reached the heavens. The **Supreme Sage** (太上) and the **Holy Sovereign** (后圣君) were enraged, and in retribution, they demoted him two ranks as a **Celestial Official** (仙), granting him an immortal lifespan but condemning him to serve as a **Daoist Summoner** (考召法师) for 1,500 years, recording the deeds of those who invoke him.\n\nThe wind requested permission to be listed among the **Daoist Summoners** (考召使). Thus, the wind was again granted favor, and his essence was returned to the **Central Peak** (中岳) for cultivation. His new role was to **Daoist Summoner** (考召使), tasked with performing **Daoist rites** (行法) to heal human illnesses and alleviate sudden calamities, thereby atoning for his past transgressions of taking life. In time, he would surely ascend to become a **Great Sage** (大仙).\n\nFor now, his term of punishment has not yet expired, and his lineage continues. Later disciples who attain **Daoist power** (得道力) must not recklessly employ it—be cautious, be cautious. The wind often deceives, and even those in the lineage of the **Celestial Sage Ge Xuan** (上仙葛玄) are not exempt from such errors or failures.\n\n**Third**, when the world suffers prolonged drought, crops wither, and farmers face ruin, there are indeed those who die from scorching heat. In secret, he performs **Daoist rites** (行法) to summon and bind the **Dragon Officials** (龙吏) of the **Community Altars** (社庙), dispatching them to bring rain and save the situation. This is a great virtue and merit.\n\nThe **Celestial Master Lao** (老君) said: When the world suffers prolonged drought, there are indeed those harmed by it. One may perform the rite at night when all is still: within a chamber where no one can see, tread the ground three times in **Yujian’s Pattern** (蹑地纪), then three times in **Flying Youth’s Pattern** (飞夭纲), forward, backward, and reversed. Finally, scatter the steps into **Yu’s Three-Step, Nine-Trace Pattern** (禹步三步九迹).\n\nWhen done, recite the incantation:\n*\"Supreme Sage Li Lao, in the Ninefold Celestial Realm above,\nAmidst the myriad layers of colorful clouds,\nRiding the Qilin.\nBy command, I dispatch the Great True Officials (大真王) below,\nJo, to issue the warrant.\nSummon the Dragon Officials (龙吏)—those of the Month, Day, and Hour—\nTo bring rain.\"*\n\nWhen the incantation is complete, don the ritual robes and return. With the right hand, perform the **Heavenly Seal** (天关), pointing toward the Dragon Stream Pool (龙溪潭) within the palm. After pointing, instruct the scribes to prepare the warrant. If there is a grand temple near the pool, the warrant is delivered there. If no grand temple exists, the warrant is issued and dispatched to the Dragon Stream Pool, ordering the dragons to bring rain. The dragons within the pool will respond promptly, and the rain will descend swiftly—even faster than the quenching of water and fire.\n\nIf one recognizes the incantation within the **Palm Technique** (掌诀), examine it closely and recite it as transmitted by the **Original Master** (本师) through oral instruction.\n\n**Fourth**, when the heavens bring prolonged rain without ceasing, flooding crops, this is called **Heavenly Illness** (天病), caused by the **Dragon Deities’** (神龙) licentious chaos. One performs the rite to clear the skies.\n\nThe **Celestial Master Lao** (老君) said: At night when all is still, in a secluded place where no one can observe, tread the ground three times in **Yujian’s Pattern** (蹑地纪), then three times in **Flying Youth’s Pattern** (飞夭纲), forward, backward, and reversed. When done, lower the **Pattern** (纲), scattering it into **Yu’s Three-Step, Nine-Trace Pattern** (禹步三步九迹). Don the ritual robes, and with the left hand, perform the **Heavenly Seal** (天关), pointing toward the **Ninefold Clouds and Vapor of the Ten Thousand Miles** (万里云气九度). Afterward, recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Supreme Sage Li Lao, by the Golden Mouth’s decree,\nToday at the [specific hour], I dispatch the clearing—\nThus dissolving the **Heavenly Illness** (天病).\nThe heavens and earth become clear and bright,\nThe sun and moon shine forth in their courses.\"*\n\nWhen done, lower the **Warrant** (将), and order the scribes to write it. The **Day-Symbol Official** (符官) holds the warrant, and it is delivered to the **City Deities and Community Altars** (城隍社庙), where the deities collectively summon the Dragon Officials (龙王), the Wind Deities (风伯), and the Rain Officials (雨师), commanding them to swiftly gather the clouds and halt the rain. By the [specific hour] today, the skies shall clear—just as swiftly as water and fire parting.\"\n\n**Fifth**, when a sudden violent wind arises, snapping trees and toppling houses, yet it is not the work of the **Heavenly Dao-spirits** (天神) or **Dao-spirits** (神)—for though the Dao-spirits may create wind and rain, they do not cause harm—\n\n---\n\n**Sixth**, when passing [a place], one may perform the ritual to summon and restrain it, and it shall cease.\n\nThe **Laozi** said: \"Inform **Heavenly Dao-spirit General** (禁天大将军) **Zhao Boqin** (赵伯禽): Zhao Boqin is a man of Chu, capable of restraining the **Dragon-Lynx** (龙麟), **Sheep-Panther** (羊豹), **Tiger** (虎), and other such beasts from the heavens.\n\nThe **Emperor Taiwei** (太微帝) composed the *Chapter of the Stepping Void* (步虚章), stating:\n*\"Three hundred celestial beasts, the **Lion** (师子) numbering ten thousand *li* (寻).\nAll manner of beasts and birds—**Phoenix** (凤凰), **Peng** (鹏), **Golden-Winged** (金翅)—\neach one restrained and captured, then cast down to the earthly realm for judgment.\nThey are released to ascend once more.\nTogether with the winds, clouds, rains, snows, frosts, and dews,\nthey obey the **Daoist** (道) will and respond to invocation,\nand their cessation is immediate and potent.*\n\nFor the **spirited beasts and birds** (灵禽兽) that dwell above, they uphold the **Heavenly Dao-qi** (天正气), the **Dao’s** (道) own manifestation. These beasts also assist the **Dao-qi** (正气) and perpetually guard and protect those who embody the **Dao** (有道之人). They must not be recklessly restrained or forbidden.\n\nIf restrained, they lose their vigor and strength—\ntheir ability to soar through the clouds and traverse the skies diminishes daily.\nWhen beasts and birds are forbidden from their natural heroic prowess and courage,\nthey cannot maintain their strength, their soaring through the clouds weakens daily,\nand they perish in exhaustion.\n\n**Mischievous beasts and birds** (妖兽妖禽), however, must be restrained.\nIf not restrained, they descend to the lower realms and wreak havoc (作妖变),\nplaguing humanity (祟害人物), causing unrest among all.\nThus, it is appropriate to restrain them.\nBut if they are not acting maliciously (不为妖祟),\nthey must not be arbitrarily forbidden—\nforbidding them is to defy **Heaven** (反天).\nBeware of this.\n\nThe **Later Sage Emperor** (后圣君) declared:\n*'Among the **Dragons** (龙), there are **Mischievous Dragons** (妖龙);\namong the **Tigers** (虎), there are **Mischievous Tigers** (妖虎);\nall celestial beasts (天兽) may manifest as **monstrous** (妖怪).\nThey must be restrained as needed, lest they harm humanity.\nThe method of restraint: first, tread the **Earthly Memorial** (地纪) three times,\nthen fly the **Celestial Halter** (飞天纲) three times,\nand recite the incantations.\nThe **Earthly Memorial** has eighteen incantations,\nthe **Celestial Halter** has twelve.\nWhen the incantations are complete,\nperform the **Yubu Steps** (禹步), don the ritual garments (配衣),\nturn the **Heavenly Barrier** (天关) nine times,\nand point downward nine times (指之九下).\nThen issue the **summons** (牒) to follow the beasts,\ncommanding those of similar kind to capture them,\nand bring them to the **Daoist assembly** (道场) for judgment.\nWhen the incantations are complete,\ndissolve into the **Yubu Steps** (禹步), don the ritual garments (配衣),\nturn the **Celestial Halter** (天关) nine times,\nand point downward nine times (指之九度).\nDispatch agents (使者) of corresponding rank,\nseize the summons (把牒),\nand pursue their capture.\nOnce they arrive, interrogate and sentence them,\nthen release them—\ndo not kill them recklessly.\nTo halt the **violent wind** (狂风):\nThe **Laozi** said: First tread the **Earthly Memorial** (地纪) three times,\nthen fly the **Celestial Halter** (天纲) three times,\nand recite the incantations.\nThe incantations must not be spoken aloud (不得高),\nlest human ears hear them—\nfor if heard, the **Heavenly Dragons** (天龙) and **Dao-spirits** (神) will not submit.*\n\nThe **Laozi** commands the **Seven Stars of the Big Dipper** (北斗七星):\n*\"Within the **Heavenly Dao** (大道),\nthe **Dao** is upright and balanced.\nThe **Dao-spirits** (神) are just and without malice,\nthe **Dragons** (龙) are upright and without excess,\nand **ghosts and mischievous beings** (鬼妖) dare not move.\nThe unjust dare not act.\nWhy then does this **violent wind** (狂风) arise,\ndisturbing the **Heavenly Court** (天庭),\nsnapping trees and toppling houses?\nThe **Laozi** captures you—\nthe **Warrant** (符) and **Summons** (牒) are now invoked.\nYou **malicious Dao-spirits** (凶神) and **mischievous Dragons** (妖龙),\nshall no longer generate wind.\nAs swift as the **Dao’s decree** (律令).*\nWhen the incantations are complete,\ndissolve into the **Yubu Steps** (禹步):\nfirst three steps with nine traces (前三步九迹),\nthen transform into twelve traces (次即变为十二迹),\nthen transform into fifteen traces (次即变十五迹).\nThen don the ritual garments (配衣),\nturn the **Celestial Halter** (天关) nine times,\nand point downward (转指之).\nIn secret, issue the **summons** (牒) to dispatch the **Day-Symbol Soldiers** (日神) and **Form-Symbol Soldiers** (式神) with their **Divine Cavalry** (兵马),\nled by the **City Deities and Community Altars** (社稷神) and their forces,\nto capture the **Wind-Generating Dao-spirits** (行风神), the **Dragons** (龙), and **ghosts** (鬼).\nSentence them according to their crimes (科央).\nAt the moment of invocation, the wind shall cease utterly,\nswift as water and fire parting.\nTwist the **mnemonic formula** (捻诀)—\nthe formula lies on the second joint of the left hand’s second finger,\nthe third joint of the second finger,\nand the second joint of the third finger.\nTwisting it shall halt the wind.\n\n**Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl Scroll** (金锁流珠引) **Volume Twenty-Three**\n**Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl Scroll** (金锁流珠引) **Volume Twenty-Four**\n\nThe **Grand Sovereign of the Dao’s True Perfection**, **Zaiwang Fangping**, **Zhang Daoling**, **Zhao Sheng**, **Wang Chang**, **Siziming Li Zhongfu**, **Mao Ying**, **Xu Yufu**, and others—these are the successive compilers and annotators of the **Chinese Daoists**. **Master Li Chunfeng** annotated the **Method of Summoning Dragons and Restraining Serpents**.\n\nThis is what **Lord Fan** and **Lord Liu** held in highest regard: in the human realm, there are venomous tigers and leopards; in the celestial realm, there are venomous dragons. This method is used to restrain them.\n\n**Laozi said:** *\"To summon dragons, one must do so at night in a pure chamber, free of women. Only then will it succeed. If a woman is nearby, it will not respond to the call.\"*\n\nWithin the chamber, do not enter a woman’s quarters, nor should a woman enter a man’s. After three days, one may tread the **Earthly Restraint** (*jì*) and the **Celestial Leash** (*gāng*), each three times.\n\nDisseminate the **Yubu Steps** in nine strides, then **twist the eyes**—the **Dragon-Tiger Eyes**. With the left hand, grasp the talisman and summon nine times downward; it will arrive instantly.\n\nSome say: *\"Further, align the garments, turn the Heavenly Pass nine times, and it will surely come.\"*\n\nDragons and tigers are thus fully summoned, each with their respective talismans as prescribed.\n\nIn the past, during the **Later Han’s destruction of Wei**, **Fan and Liu** excelled in this summoning method.\n\nAccording to *The Authentic Biography of Lady Fan*, Lady Fan was the twelfth-generation granddaughter of **Fan Kuai**, a high-ranking officer of **Emperor Gaozu of Han**. Her maternal grandfather was **Wang Zheng**, the seventeenth-generation descendant of **Wang Qiao**. Across generations, they inherited the **qi-sealing techniques**.\n\nFrom childhood, Lady Fan lost her mother and was raised by her maternal grandfather, Zheng. As a child, she loved reading, and her grandfather taught her. At thirteen, she abandoned formal studies and devoted herself to reading the *Liujia* (Six Canons), the *Rites*, and the *Yijing*. Suddenly, in the secret archives of her maternal ancestor’s thirteenth-generation home, she discovered **Laozi’s *Liujia Talismans*** (seven volumes), the ***Seven Stars Step and Leash Rites*** (ten volumes), and this ***Summoning Scripture*** (over twenty volumes). She would steal away daily to read them in the woods near her home—sometimes a hundred paces, sometimes fifty—repeatedly.\n\nAfter three years, while in the woods, she suddenly saw a young woman.\n\nThe woman asked: *\"Do you love the Dao?\"*\nShe replied: *\"Though my years are young, I love the Dao greatly. I have studied this book, which teaches the art of eternal life and immortality. Later, I shall attain the Way of the Immortal. This world rarely hears such teachings. Common folk know nothing of this Dao-scripture, and the world would otherwise have none. Thus, in my youth, I cherished its words, reading them three or five times before committing them to memory.\"*\n\nThe female immortal said: *\"I am the Immortal Alwang Xiao. I teach you to read this book. From now on, whenever you have leisure, come here. I will guide you further and teach you the methods of its practice.\"*\n\nThus, from that day forward, whenever she had free time, she would secretly go alone at noon. After two years, her maternal grandmother noticed her absence and secretly followed her to the forest, where she saw her reading with a woman. Delighted, she said nothing to others, but listened in silence for three years, until her Daoic studies were complete.\n\nWhen her mastery was achieved, she could command ghosts and spirits like servants, bending them to her will as easily as turning her hand. She could communicate with spirits, summon and bind tigers and leopards—nothing was beyond her power.\n\nDuring the reign of Emperor Wen of Wei, there was a great drought lasting over seventy days, with the sun blazing red and no clouds in sight. The emperor sought rain through every means but found no answer. The county officials recommended Lady Fan’s granddaughter, who had mastered Daoic arts, could summon tigers and leopards, and command ghosts and spirits to petition for rain.\n\nThe emperor ordered his concubine, Lady Zhao Dan, to write a request on silk, commanding her to seek rain. At the time, Lady Fan was indoors, ashamed and reluctant to comply. Lady Zhao reasoned with her: *\"You are of the Wang clan by birth. Why conceal your lineage? Given the current drought, saving lives brings merit. If the people are at peace, how can you withhold such virtue?\"*\n\nLady Fan then composed a letter to the Dragon King, which was sent into a deep pool. Rain fell immediately.\n\nAt fifteen, she married into the Liu family and traveled with her husband as an official across the empire. Later, her husband, Liu Gang, learned of her abilities and, with proper rites, requested her teachings. He received ten volumes of the scripture and was given diagrams of the Three Elements and Six Canons, along with the Seven Stars.\n\nOver fifty years later, the couple both ascended as immortals. In the Eastern Mountains of Kuaiji, his wife sat upon a cloud-driven dragon chariot and departed. Her husband ascended a *zhaojia* tree and followed her. The Daoist records then conferred upon her the title of *Xian Guan*, a mid-ranking true immortal.\n\n**The Supreme Lord Laozi’s Golden-Mouthed Edict: *The Female Qing-Shao Scripture for Protecting Households and Families (Zheng Ritual)***\n*\"Heaven is my resolute heart. My disciples and those who follow my teachings must act with sincerity and justice, rescuing beings from sickness and calamity.\"*\n\n**Calamities** are of ten kinds:\n1. Heavenly epidemic plagues—those who practice this teaching with sincerity shall not be blamed by Heaven.\n2. Seasonal prohibitions—no harm shall come from them.\n3. Official misdeeds—none shall be unjust.\n4. Fire, 5. Water, 6. War.\n7. Ghostly possession and malevolent spirits, 8. Poverty and hardship, 9. Deafness and blindness, 10. Internal ghosts.\n\nFor my summoned disciples, each year on the first day of the first month, before dawn when people are still asleep, they must issue talismans to protect their households, ensuring safety and freedom from disease and plague.\n\nThe **Supreme Lord Laozi’s Golden-Mouthed Edict** states:\n*\"The six Canons of the sixty days must be inscribed, listing the names of malevolent ghosts, along with the Female Qing Ritual, all contained within the Ghostly Statutes. Three copies must be placed at the head of the talisman: one at the community shrine, one at the ancestral hall, and one above the household door. After one year, the household shall forever be free from calamity, plague, and illness, and disputes shall naturally dissolve.*\n\n*\"Additionally, one must recite the *Diezhi Ji* and the *Feitian Gang* three times each, stepping in the Nine-Step Yujubu formation. The incantation is as follows:*\n\n*'Sue poison, sue poison,\nSue disease, sue evil,\nSue ghosts, sue serpents,\nSue speech, sue tongue,\nSue rats, sue mice,\nSue waste, sue water,\nSue metal, sue fire,\nSue earth, sue wood,\nSue deceit, O Lord of Men!*\n\n*One hundred twenty sues—sue swiftly, sue and disperse!*\n*Swiftly, as the decree commands!*\n\n*When reciting this incantation loudly, hold the written talisman in the left hand and pinch the *Dujian* talisman in the right, uttering each ‘sue’ while making a downward gesture with the hand—this brings great fortune.\"*\n\nThe Highest True Immortals perform this ritual annually without fail.\n\nLaozi said: *\"The path of Dao has gates, and the pursuit of Truth has roads. To obtain the gate is to attain *tong*—communion with spirits. When one studies the Dao and attains the gate, they possess *wei*—power to command ghosts, spirits, and the heavens, making them respond. This is called *shentong*—spiritual penetration. To obtain the road is to become an immortal. Immortals are the rank of True Persons. Those who practice the True Person’s Way and master this thirty-plus volume scripture, penetrating the Golden Talismans, later become known as the *Golden Lock Flowing Pearl Scripture*, harmonizing the Three Elements, emerging from the Upper Clarity, encompassing the Orthodox Unity—this is the path and the road to communion, enabling one to ride dragons and traverse the void, named the *Path of Daoic Cultivation to Communion*. Later, one may ride dragons and walk upon the clouds, wandering freely in the Purple Palace, near the rank of the Immortal Officials.*\n\n*If practiced for nine years, a household shall have no sickness. If practiced for twenty years, the entire family shall attain Daoic power. This method is akin to the *Bazhe* (House-Transference) technique.*\n\n**Note:** This ritual must be performed in the last days of the twelfth month (the 26th or 27th), inscribing the talismans and edicts of the Ghostly Statutes, with the master’s seal. At the stroke of three in the morning on the first day of the first month, the incantation must be recited. Modern practitioners no longer recite the words on the talisman—only the incantation is heard.\n\n**A Comprehensive Ritual for Protecting Officials’ Households and Families from Calamity**\nThis is also included in the *New Chapter Rites*.\n\nLaozi said to Master Xu: *\"Xu Le, you are a master who protects and delivers from calamity. Now you are Zhang Ti, known as the Three Heavenly Orthodoxy Master. Now you are also Xiao Zhang, succeeding Da Zhang as the Celestial Master. You teach disciples to become national masters, to protect the inner palaces of the state and to pacify the distant prefectures and counties of the people.\n\nFirst, present the Six Divine Writings of Heaven. Later, the Sage changed the titles and texts, making them into the Chapter Writings. The Most High approved them, granting talismans and edicts to the Five Sacred Mountains and Four Great Waters, to the cities and ancestral shrines. There are thirty-six volumes of grand proclamations and talismans. Twenty-four volumes are for pacifying the inner palaces, five volumes for the Five Sacred Mountains—the Sage later named them the Five Mountains, corresponding to the five phases: Wood, Fire, Earth, Water, and Metal. The remaining seven volumes: six are to be placed in sacred mountain caves, and one in the Water Palace. All these are rituals to be recited in a low, quiet voice, without musical resonance.\n\nThese are all Yang methods, human ordinances. The term *academy* (社) was once called *assembly* (斋), now changed to *gathering* (齐会). *Gathering* means to discuss and study scriptures. This is for beginners who have not yet entered the Dao. Do not let your disciples practice such methods—these are not the true, superior Chapter Rituals. The Chapter Writings originate from separate scriptures, containing five texts. The Sage-Emperor bestowed twelve talismans to pacify the nation, protect against calamity, and deliver from misfortune. Each has its own texts and rituals, detailed in the lower sections—examine and use them accordingly.\n\nLaozi said: For the ruler of a kingdom—today’s prefects and magistrates—officials, and governors: do not use proclamations. Issue three edicts and thirty-six talismans. Twelve talismans pacify the Twelve Celestial Deities, twelve talismans guard the gates, and twelve talismans are placed within the household, to be worn by the head of the family and the eldest son. Commoners may practice this freely, but do not inscribe the thirty-six talismans. Three Chapter Writings are for officials, while commoners may use two or one.\n\nWhen performing the talisman rituals, first step on the *Earth Measure*, then ascend the *Heavenly Rope*, each three times. Scatter the Nine Steps as the *Yugong Steps*, adjust the robes, and with nine fingers, dispel calamity and malevolent *qi* from houses and cities. Then, according to the talismans, place the edicts and talismans in their proper positions. For one or two years, there shall be no disasters.\n\nTo remove misfortune, pacify calamity, and protect households—use the same methods as before. Laozi’s statutes decree: Commoners use twenty-four talismans, two Chapter Writings, and practice according to the master’s intent. The secret is to pinch the first joint of the fourth finger on the left hand urgently.\n\nWhen summoning a master or disciple-master, and summoning scribes and officials: If traveling with family or oneself to another prefecture, first issue an edict to the ancestral temples and city gods. These gods existed in the Jin Dynasty. The ritual of escorting, welcoming, and bidding farewell for protection is as follows:\n\nLaozi commands the spirits of the shrines: When summoning, the master’s name must be written. For travelers with family, issue an edict five days in advance to the Nine Regions’ community leaders—Wu Zixu is one. If not summoning a proper master, issue an edict with the name written above and the scribe’s name below. If summoning a master from the Nine Regions, use a proper edict without talismans—talismans are on the edict’s head, not the seal. Laozi’s command states: Before the talisman is connected to the edict, the recording official—whether high or low—must be recorded. Today, people call Daoists *Celestial Officials*. For low-ranking officials, the edict states: ‘Regarding the aforementioned matter.’ Follow the official’s written edict, changing only the word *law* (法).\n\nFor secret edicts, follow the ritual: ‘Must issue an edict to the shrine, as follows.’ In official edicts, it states: ‘Must check the matter, as follows.’ Daoist edicts state: ‘Must issue an edict to the shrine gods and such-and-such deities, for escorting, welcoming, and bidding farewell, to protect within the boundaries. Safely convey the traveler by land or water, without any untoward incidents.’\n\nThe secret method is the same as before: pinch the first joint of the left hand.\n\n**The Talisman of Punishment and the Destruction of Shrines**\n*Punishment* refers to interrogating the talisman scribes and officials for delays or violations. If they do not comply urgently, hesitate, or fail to respond, it is called *Punishment Talisman*. *Destruction of Shrines* also interrogates the shrine and deity officials for failing to respond to talismans and edicts according to ritual. Thus, they must be punished with rods or demoted—there are other replacements—this is called *Destruction of Shrines*.\n\nLu Tianxuan transmitted the Golden-Mouthed Laozi’s ordinances: If one talisman is not honored, the blame falls on the direct scribe. *Rescript* refers to today’s Chapter Writings.\"\n\nIf the talisman is not honored, demote the direct scribe.\n\nOne may tread the earth three times while reciting the *Yǔbù* (步, \"steps\") threefold, and chant eighteen *sutra* (咒) of the *Golden-Mouthed Laozi’s* (太上老君金口) ordinances. Upon completion, disperse into the *Yǔbù* (禹步), nine strides and three steps, don the ritual robe (配衣), and shift the *Tiānguān* (天关, \"Celestial Pass\"). Point to a specific day and place.\n\nThe *earth* (地) refers to the *Yǔbù* (偃) as it aligns with today’s *jiǎzǐ* (甲子, \"first heavenly stem and earthly branch\"). If it is the *zǐ* (子) day, then the *jiǎzǐ* (甲子) is the *wángwénqīng* (王文卿) of that month and day. On this day, which talisman is being dishonored? The talisman scribes are instructed to carry out a certain matter, yet the matter is not executed. Thus, they shall be subjected to severe punishment, demotion, or replacement—cycling through these measures until compliance is achieved.\n\nWhen questioning their offenses, follow the *Golden Ordinances* (金科) and *Jade Laws* (玉律) strictly. Upon completion, report as follows: *\"Thus it is decreed.\"* As with the talisman scribes in the previous register, their swift punishment surpasses that of water or fire.\n\nThe *Destruction of Shrines* (破庙) may also be employed: tread the earth three times while reciting the *Yǔbù* (禹步), nine strides and three steps, don the ritual robe (配衣), shift the *Tiānguān* (天关), and point to a specific shrine or local deity—whether in a province, prefecture, or community—refusing to transmit talismans and edicts. The *Celestial Mandate* (天命) shall compel one to break their *yāngjǐ* (央脊, \"central support\"), demote, or replace them. If no replacement is made, it is simply *Destruction*. Upon completion, report.\n\nThe later *Saintly Master* (后圣君) told *Zhang Tiānshī* (张天师):\n\n*\"The Punishment of Talismans and the Destruction of Shrines*\nare the ancient methods of the *Zhìzhēnrén* (志真人, \"True Persons of Will\"). They request the *Tiānshén Dàjiāngjūn* (天神大将军, \"Celestial Deity Great Generals\") and the *Dàguān* (大官, \"Great Officials\") to descend and oversee the interrogations, punishments, demotions, and destructions.\n\nI now rely solely on the *originally appointed Three Generals* (元差三将军), whose responses align with my own. The *Celestial General* (某元将军) above corresponds to my body’s response below.\n\nSimply invoke the *Upper, Middle, and Lower Originals* (上中下元), and observe their actions. Do not employ additional talismans or petition the *Celestial Officials* (天官) to descend for the *Punishment of Talismans* and *Destruction of Shrines*. These two methods have their own secret techniques (诀).\n\nThe secret technique lies on the third joint of the left hand’s third finger, on the right side. Twist it.\n\nIf this private method is practiced three or five times, upon completion, simply twist the secret technique—then the talisman scribes will naturally reveal those who have delayed or erred. Request their dismissal, and the technique shall always grant pardon. Thereafter, the talisman scribes will grow even more reverent.\n\nAt the mere thought of employing it, the action is initiated. Upon rising and reciting, the result is immediate.\n\nDo not act rashly—this is the method of the *Zhìzhēnrén* (志真人, \"True Persons of Will\"). Be cautious!\"*\n\n「The Three Assemblies’ *Ritual of the Daoist Assembly* (三会日醮) and *Sacrificial Offerings for the Blind* (祭盲功) to Bestow Merit and Promote Officials and Soldiers (迁赏吏兵法)\n\nFor the *Ritual of the Assembly* (社庙), do not bestow merit with wine. Instead, have them sit outside the altar (坛).\n\nThe *Venerable Master Lao* (老君) said: Those who receive the *Law* (法) must follow the prescribed rituals (科仪) for the *Assembly Offerings* (醮祭), then auspiciousness (吉) shall follow; otherwise, misfortune (凶) will ensue. Those with *Lofty Aspirations* (上志之人) understand this *Way* (道).\n\nThe ritual states: On the *Upper Assembly Day* (上会) of the *Upper Month* (上元月), the *Assembly Offering* (醮) is made to *Heavenly Officials, Lord of the Upper Month* (天官君上元唐将军), and *Tang General of the Upper Assembly* (上元上部唐将军), whose surname is *Tang* and given name is *Short* (名短).\n\nOn the *Middle Assembly Day* (中会) of the *Middle Month* (中元月), the *Middle Assembly General* (中元中部葛将军) and others, including *Li General of the Middle Assembly* (上元中部李将军), serve as the *Assembly Offering* (醮) leaders. *Li General* commands the *Earthly Officials* (地官), while *Ge General* (葛将军) oversees the *Three Spirits of the Human Form* (人身三魂) and *Seven Souls* (七魄), the *Three Generals within the Body* (身中三将军), the *One Hundred Fifty Generals* (百五十将军), and the *Spiritual and Divine Officers and Soldiers* (仙灵将吏). Those who receive *Talismans and Ordinations* (符箓) as the *Divine Seat* (仙座) for the *Middle Month* (中元) are led by *Li* and *Ge Generals*, who command the *Heavenly Officials* (天官) and *Water Officials* (水官) and others. On this day, the *Three Months’ Generals and Soldiers* (三元将军吏兵), the *Functional Officials* (功曹司吏), the *Six Celestial Stems’ Generals and Soldiers* (六甲君官将军兵吏), the *Jade Boys and Jade Girls* (玉童玉女), and the *Direct Palace and Attendant Officials and Talisman Scribes* (直宫从官符吏) all gather to sit and receive the *Assembly Offering* (醮).\n\nThis day is the seventh day of the first month (正月七日). The *Upper Assembly* (上会) summons the *Nine Celestial Officials* (九天之官), the *Middle Assembly* (中会) invites the *Nine Earthly Officials* (九地之官), and the *Lower Assembly* (下会) calls upon the *Generals and Soldiers of the Human Form’s Talismans and Ordinations* (人身中法箓将军吏兵) and the *Water Officials’ Generals and Soldiers* (水官将军吏兵).\n\nThe *Later Sage-Emperor* (后圣君) instructed the *Heavenly Master* (天师): On the *Three Assemblies’ Days* (三会之日), the *Generals and Soldiers of the Three Officials* (天地水三官中大神君将军吏兵) all gather on this day for the *Assembly Offering* (社会), seeking to partake in the *Assembly Sacrifice* (求饮醮). This day’s *Assembly Offering* (醮) can expiate sins, bring blessings, and nurture fortune for all beings (福佑人物). It can also cultivate and nourish slaves, servants, cattle, and horses (育养奴婢牛马之类). Disasters and calamities will be averted (祸灭灾消), and joy and celebration will fill the household (身家喜庆). Why? Because on these three days, the *Three Officials* (三官) and the *Three Divine Generals* (三神) of Heaven, Earth, and Water all convene together (俱会於此日).\n\nThe *Most High Emperor* (上帝) graciously relents, and on these days, one need not attend the morning court assemblies (不朝集). Thus, blessings are obtained (所以获福).\n\nMoreover, the *Assembly Offering* (醮) must be performed on the night of the *proper day* (正日). After the *people’s rest* (人定), during the *first watch* (一更时), or the *second watch* (二更时), the greatest blessings and protections (大福佑) can be secured. This is when all the gods gather (此时众神俱会之时). If the ritual extends beyond the *third watch* (三更) until the *fifth watch* (五更), it is absolutely unsuited for the *Assembly Offering* (切不堪醮). Why? Because the *Divine and Heavenly Officials* (神官仙官) and *Generals and Soldiers* (将军吏兵), all belonging to the *yin* (阴), appear as if seen by humans during the night. They attend the early morning court assemblies (日日早朝会家) and ordinary guests (闲客) may come. Important guests (要客) are summoned for official matters (皆有公事), and they only arrive after the court session concludes (直至衙退). The *Divine Officials* (神官), *Heavenly Officials* (仙官), and *Generals and Soldiers* (将军吏兵) from the *third watch* (三更) onward until the *fifth watch* (五更) are all eager to attend the morning court sessions (上朝天曹). Their minds are preoccupied with the affairs before them (心攻前排整), and they are busy with their attendants and carriages (车御忙). If their thoughts are scattered or distracted (心乱思), they will not come to receive the rites (不来受礼), or if they do come, they will stay only briefly (来亦不久), appearing and disappearing in haste (忽忽不多周匝). Thus, no blessings are gained, and misfortune is instead invited (所以不获福，却招恶).\n\nFor those who aspire to the *Way* (志人学道), they must first recognize this as a profound truth (先须知此为妙) and be cautious not to reveal it rashly to unworthy individuals (慎勿妄示非人). If unworthy individuals (非人) speak of erroneous doctrines (妄说异端), they will incur the *Heavenly Judgment* (天考).\n\nThe ritual further states: On the *Middle Assembly Day* (中会) of the *Middle Month* (中元月), the *Middle Assembly Offering* (醮) is led by *Earthly Officials, Lord of the Middle Month* (地官君上元中部李将军) and *Ge General of the Middle Assembly* (中元中部葛将军), among others.\n\nThe *Later Sage-Emperor* (后圣君) instructed the *Heavenly Master* (天师): Between Heaven and Earth (天地之间), following the *Two Principles* (二仪), there are the *Three Months* (三元), with the *Middle Month* (中元) being the joint master of Earth and humanity (地人两主). *Li General* commands the *Earthly Officials* (地官), while *Ge General* oversees the *Three Spirits of the Human Form* (人身三魂), *Seven Souls* (七魄), the *Three Generals within the Body* (身中三将军), the *One Hundred Fifty Generals* (百五十将军), and the *Divine and Spiritual Officers and Soldiers* (仙灵将吏). Those who receive *Talismans and Ordinations* (符箓) for the *Middle Month* (中元) are seated as the *Divine Seat* (仙座) to govern the *qi of the Middle Month* (中元之气), all under the command of *Li* and *Ge Generals*. They lead the *Heavenly Officials* (天官) and *Water Officials* (水官) and others. The *Three Months* (三元) are fully represented, and the *Generals, Officers, and Soldiers* (官将史兵) assemble.\n\nFirst, the *Generals and Soldiers of the Upper and Lower Months* (上元及下元君官将军), the *Functional Officials and Soldiers* (兵士功曹司吏), the *Generals and Soldiers of the Six Celestial Stems* (六甲君官将军兵吏), the *Jade Boys and Jade Girls* (玉童玉女), and the *Direct Palace and Attendant Officials and Talisman Scribes* (直宫从官符吏) take their seats. Only then do the *Two Generals of the Lower Month* (下元徐周二将军二人), *Xu General of the Upper Water Assembly* (上元下部徐将军) and *Zhou General of the Middle Water Assembly* (中元下部周将军), along with their soldiers (及兵士), sit.\n\nThe *Master* (师主) must focus their mind and command the *Seat of the Assembly* (指撝座位). Only after this is settled (定后) should the ritual begin (方始启请). Each must be clearly provided with food and drink (分明一一饮食在). The *Master* (师主) must arrange and oversee the offerings (指摄安置), particularly the wine (上酒处分), and ensure the proper number of libations (般数取足).\n\nHave someone prepare additional *secret gruel* (密浆之属) and other offerings, ensuring the *True Person of Will* (保真) sees *Venerable Master Li* (李尊师). They must add tea, offering three or four cups per seat (每座三四盏). The *True Person of Will* (保真) must then request *Ding* (丁) to conduct the *Assembly Offering* (醮) and transmit the *Law* (传法), bowing in reverence to their original teacher (伏依本师) and daring not to neglect or disobey (不敢违阙). They must ask that the teachings be passed down through generations (请后人相传继代), ensuring the *Way* of their original teacher is never lost (莫绝本师之教).\n\nThe ritual further states: On the *Lower Assembly Day* (下会) of the *Lower Month* (下元月), the *Water Officials, Lords of the Lower Assembly* (水官君上元下部徐将军) and *Zhou General of the Middle Water Assembly* (中元下部周将军), among others, lead the *Assembly Offering* (醮).\n\nThe *Later Sage-Emperor* (后圣君) instructed *Zhang the Heavenly Master* (张天师): On the *Upper Assembly Day* (上会), the seventh day of the first month (正月七日), the *Heavenly True Ones* (天真) descend to observe (下观). If one sets up the *Assembly Offering* (设醮) on this day, the *Heavenly Officials* (天官君), *Generals and Soldiers* (兵将), and *Earthly and Water Officials* (地水官) must wholeheartedly approach with sincerity and reverence (尽心须以虔恳), avoiding any impurity or vulgarity (勿秽浊), and receive boundless blessings (受福无量).\n\nOn the *Middle Assembly Day* (中会), the *Earthly True Ones* (地真) come to supervise the *Assembly Offering* (来监醮). The *Earthly Officials* (地官君), *Generals and Soldiers* (兵将), and *Heavenly and Water Officials* (天官水官君) must be invited. On the *Lower Assembly Day* (下会), the *Water True Ones* (水真) descend to supervise (来监醮). The *Water Officials* (水官君), *Generals and Soldiers* (兵将), and *Heavenly and Earthly Officials* (天地官君) must all be invited.\n\nThe *Middle Assembly Day* (中会) is the seventh day of the seventh month (七月七日). The *Lower Assembly Day* (下会) is the fifth day of the tenth month (十月五日). These three days are the *Three Assembly Days* (并是三会之日).\n\nFirst, the *Generals and Soldiers of the Upper and Middle Months* (先领上元及中元君官将军), the *Functional Officials and Soldiers* (兵士功曹可吏等), take their seats. Only then do the *Two Generals of the Lower Month* (下元徐周二将军二人), *Xu* and *Zhou Generals* (徐周), along with their soldiers (及兵士), sit.\n\nThe *Master* (师主) must focus their mind and command the *Seat of the Assembly* (心分主领指撝座位). This is for those who receive the *Talismans and Ordinations of the Three Months* (受三元箓人) to conduct the *Assembly Offering* (自醮), as well as for those who invite disciples and fellow students (及入诸弟子等共醮). Thus, it is called the *Master* (师主).\n\nThe *Later Sage-Emperor* (后圣君) instructed the *Heavenly Master* (天师): You are the *Master of the Three Months’ Talismans and Ordinations* (三元法箓吏兵师主), so in ancient times, you were designated as the *Master* (师主) for disciples and fellow students (有弟子及同学人兵). When conducting the *Assembly Offering* (设醮), each must follow the prescribed words (各依辞). If the words are recited by oneself (如若自辞), then the prescribed words need not be used (即不用辞). After finishing the words (读词毕), one must recite the *Record of Merit and Deeds* (功状一遍).\n\nThe *Record* (状) speaks of merit and deeds (言功), the promotion and bestowal of officials and soldiers (迁赏吏兵). If there is indeed merit (如实有功), then it must be spoken of. If there is no merit (如无功), then the mention of merit must be omitted (即不用言功).」\n\nThe *Later Sage-Emperor’s* original *Record of Merit and Deeds* states:\n\n*\"If there is merit, it must be spoken of, and officials and soldiers shall be promoted. If there is no merit, though one’s family and self remain protected and at peace, this is not considered merit. However, if military achievements are spoken of, they are accepted. Historians and soldiers are not bound by the limits of promotion or merit—merely mentioning the reward of officials and soldiers suffices.*\n\n*The Record speaks of merit and promotion: the legal documents of a certain prefecture, county, or village, or the appointment to a certain official post. The Daoist priest speaks of the Daoist of a certain mountain observatory. This pertains to the Heavenly Master’s ancient and modern *Taixuan* (太玄) *San Yuan* (三元) talismans and ordinations.*\n\n*The *Yangping* (阳平) *Zhizuo* (治左平炁) oversees the *Menxia* (门下) *Dadu* (大都功), along with the *Zuoli* (左廉察) *Ban* (版署) *Jijiu* (祭酒). The *Shangqing Xuandu* (上清玄都), anciently known as *Taqing Wují* (太清无极), is the *Taishang Dadao Wují* (太上大道无极) *Fa Shi* (法师).

The details include [number] people cured by talismans and medicinal prescriptions, [number] poor and sick individuals who lacked funds to buy medicine and were thus provided with money or medicine by your servant—each case recorded where recovery was achieved. Or [number] people suffering from official or private disputes and slander, who were rescued by your servant’s talismans and emerged unscathed, without facing severe punishment, with a total of [number] such cases recorded.\n\n*Your servant dispatched the *Lingguan Jiangjun* (灵官将军), the *Shibing Gongcao* (史兵功曹), the *Yunü Yutong* (玉女玉童), who through their powers rescued and delivered [number] individuals, sparing them from illness, death, or punishment. These generals and soldiers have rendered merit, warranting promotion by one rank. All those saved have fully recovered.\n\n*Additionally, your servant’s household has been protected, ensuring the well-being of your servant’s family and self, thus earning merit. The *Jiangjun* (将军), *Xianlingguan* (仙灵官), *Gongcao* (功曹), *Yutong* (玉童), and *Yunü* (玉女), along with the *Libing* (吏兵), have performed according to the regulations, and their merits are recorded: the *Jiangjun* (将军) with 200 merits, the *Xianlingguan* (仙灵官) with 150 merits, the *Gongcao* (功曹), *Yutong* (玉童), and *Yunü* (玉女) each with 100 merits, and the *Libing* (吏兵) with 100 merits as well.

The promotions and appointments follow their own prescribed rituals.\n\n　　For regions and prefectures plagued by disasters—such as floods, fires, illnesses, and calamities—where people suffer unrest, the appropriate *fú* (符) and *zhāo* (章) are drafted to invoke *zhèn* (镇) and *yàn* (厌) rites.\n\n　　The *Lǎojūn* (老君) instructed the Daoist master Luo (罗法师): \"In the world, there are prefectures and regions afflicted by numerous disasters, where people and spirits are unsettled. You may now act to pacify them. Specifically, on the four *Mèng* (孟) days—*yín* (寅), *shēn* (申), *wèi* (巳), and *hài* (亥)—you shall tread the *Dìjì* (地纪) and invoke the *Fēitiān Gāng* (飞天纲), each three times.\n\n　　Afterward, you shall scatter the *Dàyǔ Bù* (大禹步) fifteen times, while simultaneously reciting the *Dūjiān Jué* (都监诀) with your left hand and holding the talisman with your right hand. Once the talisman is inscribed with the proper words, perform this rite and issue the talisman, commanding the practitioner to kneel and receive it before departing.\n\n　　In accordance with the later edicts of the *Shèngjūn* (圣君) and the *Tiānshī* (天师), when performing the *Bù* (步) and *Gāng* (纲) rites, you must not be seen. After completing the rites, summon the practitioner to kneel and receive the talisman. The talisman is then sent forward.\n\n　　Later, you shall compose the written record...」\n\n「In the world, there are prefectures and counties plagued by frequent calamities, where people and things are restless. You may dispel such disturbances. Do so on the four *Mèng* days—*yín* (寅), *shēn* (申), *wèi* (巳), and *hài* (亥)—as specified.\n\nAfterward, inscribe the talisman with the *Shànggǔ* (上古) twelve talismans and the *Zhāng Tiānshī* (张天师) twenty-four talismans, along with two additional talismans from the *Fēng* (风) tradition. The household head, wife, and local officials must also bear one talisman each. In total, distribute twenty-eight talismans of the *Dào* (道).\n\nThe talismans are listed in the *Dìngzhái Yí* (镇宅仪). The twelve talismans of the *Shànggǔ* (上古) are used to pacify the twelve deities overseeing the dwelling, while twelve talismans are affixed to the doors and windows, including the rear door and stove. Additionally, four talismans are posted above, and the household head and wife bear them as well. Once this is done, within three years, calamities and illnesses shall cease forever.\n\nIf you perform a second round of pacification, within six years, no calamities shall arise. Should they persist, perform another round as before, and then calamities shall never arise again for a hundred years.\n\nThe following ritual is prescribed: The *Gāozhēn Shàngshèng* (高真上圣) decrees that a well-pacified dwelling shall forever be free from calamities. This method was first recorded in the *Tàixuān Jīnsuǒ Liúzhū Zhèngyī Jīng* (太玄金锁流珠正一经). The *Zhào Tiǎng* (赵筒) edition cites its use for rescuing people and things alike.\n\nFor distant disturbances in prefectures, counties, or commanderies—where mountain demons (*Shānguǐ* 山魈), mountain ghosts (*Shānguǐ* 山鬼), or malevolent spirits cause chaos—employ this ritual to summon and banish them.\n\nThe *Lǎojūn* (老君, Venerable Lao) instructs the *Tàijí Zhēnrén* (太极真人, True Person of the Supreme Ultimate) Xu Fǎshī (徐法师): If you are the ruler of a prefecture, county, or commandery and perform this ritual to banish disturbances, first inscribe the talismans and affix them as directed.\n\nThen, tread the *Dìjì* (地纪) three times, scatter the *Dàyǔ Bù* (大禹步) in three sets of nine steps, and simultaneously recite the *Dūjiān Jué* (都监诀), along with the *Shānguǐ Mù* (山鬼目) and the *Dāozhī Jué* (刀支诀) and others.\n\nThe *Shānguǐ Mù* (山鬼目) is located on the right side of the second joint of the left hand’s fifth finger; pinch it urgently. The *Dāozhī* (刀支) and others are on the third joint of all five fingers; pinch them urgently.\n\nAfterward, issue the talismans, which are drawn from the *Sān Bù Záshuō* (三部杂符, Three Categories of Miscellaneous Talismans). The incantation for distribution is as follows:\n\n*\"Qián zūn yào líng* (乾尊耀灵), *kūn shùn nèi róng* (坤顺内荣)—so it is decreed.\"*\n\nAgain, it is issued with the words:\n\n*\"The moon’s constellation governs [certain deities] on the day of [certain deities]; thus, the *Xuānqǐ* (玄启) shall mark auspicious days and fine hours, the *Líhuì* (喜会) shall gather the host of celestial treasuries. Then, the *Xuāndiǎo* (玄澡) shall bathe in purity, and the *qīngzhāi* (清斋) shall be observed. Offer incense and treasures to the *Zhūtiān Dàsèng* (诸天大圣, Great Sages of All Heavens), *Huángdì Lǎojūn* (皇帝老君, Venerable Lao the Emperor), the *Běidǒu Qīxīng* (北斗七星, Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper), the *Èrshíbā Sù* (二十八宿, Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions), and the eight *Shǐshén* (史神, Deity Historians) of *Qián* (乾), *Kàn* (坎), *Gèn* (艮), *Zhèn* (震), *Xùn* (巽), *Lí* (离), *Kūn* (坤), and *Duì* (兑).\n\nWith utmost reverence, I entrust my disciple [name] to receive these divine talismans. May the talismans of the *Dōngfāng Qīngdì* (东方青帝, Green Emperor of the East) be invoked to cure the *Jiǎo* (角, Horn) region, binding malevolent ghosts and delivering them to the prison for torture. May the talismans of the *Nánfāng Chìdì* (南方赤帝, Red Emperor of the South) be invoked to cure the *Zhēng* (征, Conqueror) region, binding malevolent ghosts and delivering them to the prison for confinement. May the talismans of the *Xīfāng Báidì* (西方白帝, White Emperor of the West) be invoked to cure the *Shāng* (商, Commerce) region, binding malevolent ghosts and boiling them in the caldron of *Tāng* (汤, Hot Water). May the talismans of the *Běifāng Hēidì* (北方黑帝, Black Emperor of the North) be invoked to cure the *Yǔ* (羽, Feather) region, binding malevolent ghosts and cooking them in the caldron. May the talismans of the *Zhōngyāng Huángdì* (中央黄帝, Yellow Emperor of the Center) be invoked to cure the *Gōng* (宫, Palace) region, binding malevolent ghosts and delivering them to the caldron.\n\nAll fivefold malevolent ghosts shall be subdued, and every demonic influence shall be eradicated.\n\nFrom this day onward, may [name] of [prefecture/county/township/village] and all their households—great and small—thrive and flourish. May their granaries overflow with grain and their storerooms brim with silk and brocade. May all thousand calamities and ten thousand misfortunes be sent far away to other realms. May malevolent ghosts and wicked men become mere sources of slander, all vanquished and annihilated.\n\n*\"Chìduō!\"* (叱咄, Rebuke!) *\"Shúshú rú!\"* (急急如, Swiftly as!)」\n\n**The Supreme Female Qing of the Ghostly Capital’s Edicts Against Spirits**\n\nAgain, the incantation reads:\n\n*\"The Supreme Venerable Lord Lao,*\nborn before Heaven and Earth.\nIlluminated by the Nine *Qi*,\nhe banished and subdued all spirits.\nThe *She* officials and their kindred,\nthough lacking true form,\nassume names and deceive the world.\nThe dead who do not register in the Ghostly Ledger\nshall be stripped of

the *Kǎochāo* method—\nconstantly cultivate the mind to aid the state and stabilize the realm,\nto rescue and heal the common folk.\nAll matters must be self-suppressed to silence slander.*\n\nWithin the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water,\nthere are many jealous ghosts and resentful spirits,\nwho constantly make one’s nature cruel and coarse,\nunsettled and unaligned with the Dao—\nthus causing one’s family and descendants to suffer from others’ tongues.\nEach year on the Fifth of the Fifth Month,\nwrite and carry a talisman—\nand for the entire year, all slander shall

Month,\nwithin a secluded chamber,\nrecite the *Dìjì* (地纪) three times.\nDo not use the *Fēitiān Gāng* (飞天纲),\nbut only the *Yǔbù* (禹步) on the ground.\nWhen finished,\ndissolve into three steps of nine traces,\nthen twelve steps again,\nthen fifteen turns—\nand call out the name of the slanderer.\nThis person, who falsely slanders you with countless words,\nmust be silenced—\nif they do not

again.\nIf it persists, recite the incantation again—\nand they shall meet ruin and die.*\n\nLater, the Sage Emperor instructed the Heavenly Master:\n*'This method is highly efficacious—\ndo not use it recklessly.\nOnly when truly justified may it be employed.\nThe Venerable Lao forbids misuse,\nlest harm befall the innocent,\nand you incur guilt, losing your immortality.*\n\nIf one is falsely slandered without cause,\nfirst attempt to silence them.\nIf they refuse three times,\nthen this method may be applied.*\n\n**For Officials and Commoners: The Method to Suppress Slander**\n*The Venerable Lao declares:*\n*'Those who practice the *Kǎochāo* method\nmust purify body and mind—\nthat is, body and mind must be pure.\nThey must not eat meat,\ntake a wife, or bear children,\nbut must keep the heart upright,\nneither partial nor deceitful,\nneither gluttonous nor lustful,\nneither jealous nor resentful,\nneither hateful nor fond,\nneither encroaching nor stealing,\nneither quarrelsome nor competitive,\nneither licentious nor promiscuous.*\n\nLater, the Sage Emperor instructed Master Zhang:\n*'If one remains loyal and upright,\nwithout favoritism or cliques,\nand does not accept biased requests or demands,\nthen this method may be used.*\n\nWhen body and mind are pure,\nno licentiousness or theft arises.\nThe Heavenly Master said:\n*\"These two characters are difficult to explain—\nI beg you to clarify for the ignorant masses.*\nThe Emperor replied:\n*\"One may have concubines,\nbut must not lust after others’ wives.\nChildren must receive scriptures and precepts—\ndo not falsely claim or steal them,\nfor such deeds are grave offenses.\nBeware, for the Supreme Dao does not tolerate them.*\n\nIf a devoted scholar, with sincere intent,\npractices the Dao and governs with purity,\nyet is falsely slandered—\nnot merely defamed or accused of treachery,\nbut relentlessly beset by slander—\nthen three talismans may be written and carried,\nand the slanderer shall cease.\nThese talismans are found in the *Sanbù Záshú* (三部杂符),\nbut their full text is not recorded here.\nIf they persist,\nseal them with the *Liùrén Léigōng* (六壬雷公) formula and others.\nThe method is recorded in the *Shìjīng* (式经).\nWithin the *Shìjīng* are talismans and seals—\nuse them as prescribed, and the effect is swift,\nlike fire and water.\n\nAfter sealing, within a pure chamber,\nrecite the *Dìjì* three times,\nthe *Fēitiān Gāng* three times,\nthen dissolve into three steps of nine traces,\nadjust the clothing,\nturn the *Tiānguān* (天关),\nand point remotely.\nThe incantation is:\n*\"The Five Phases push one another—\nMetal attacks Wood,\nWater extinguishes Fire—\nand so on.\"\nRecite three times.\nWhen finished,\npinch the talisman’s seal—\nthe seal is beneath the first fingernail of the left hand.\nPinch the slanderer’s mouth shut\nand send them to water and fire.\nThis method is divine and secret—\nguard it well.*\n\n**For Officials and Commoners: The Method to Sever Internal and External Curses, Ghostly Bandits, and False Witchcraft That Kills Without Ceasing**\n*The Venerable Lao declares:*\n*'All people, noble or base,\nsuffer from curses—\ninternal and external deaths.\nGhosts enter homes,\ndemanding living souls to replace the dead,\nthus creating curses.\nWithin families, brothers or fathers and sons may curse one another—\nsuch cases are common.\nThe world calls this *mù* (墓).\nLi Zūnshī Huìjǔ said:\n*\"This is the curse afflicting the family now—\nit does not cease.\nThose who seek to replace the dead\nare tormented by worms devouring their souls,\nas if bitten by insects—\nterrified and in agony.\nThus, they seek a substitute.\n\nIf a Daoist possesses the method,\nand can sever this curse,\ntheir merit is great—\nHeaven and Earth rejoice,\nand the practitioner may attain the Dao.\nSaving one family earns one hundred merits:\nThe living gain health and longevity,\nwhile the restless spirits escape the suffering of worms devouring their souls,\nand are reborn as humans,\nfree from the resentment of curses.\n\nA Daoist may save and sever them,\nending life and death,\nand earning gratitude from Heaven and Earth—\nthis is the Dao’s merit.*\n\n*The Venerable Lao’s method to sever curses\nincludes five talismans,\nalong with decrees to the local deities, ancestral temples, city gods, and officials.\nIn ancient times, only ancestral temples were mentioned—\nno city gods existed.\nIt began with King Ke of Wu,\nwhose tomb was in Wúzhōu (吴中).\nDuring the Jin Dynasty,\nGovernor Liu Wénjǐng built a city there,\ncovering the tomb.\nEach night, the city walls collapsed,\nand the earth was carried away by yin-forces—\nby dawn, no trace remained,\nand this happened seven or eight times.\"*\n\nThe Governor acted swiftly that very night, ordering men to capture the spirits. In the night, he saw a single sovereign emerge from the earth, accompanied by tens of thousands of soldiers, who repelled the captors. The sovereign said to them: \"I am King Ke of Wu. My tomb sinks two *zhang* (丈) into the earth—why do you persist in building a city over it? Each night, I cause the walls to collapse and the earth to be carried away by *yin-forces* (阴兵). By dawn, no trace remains, and this has occurred seven or eight times.\"\n\nThe Governor thus retained the tomb, moved the city walls to curve around it, and established a temple a hundred *bu* (步) away. Henceforth, there were city gods and spirit officials. Today, wherever there are graves in the *dìfǔ* (地府, Underworld), if they confer with the Underworld authorities, the Most High Celestial Emperor grants permission for the deceased to become the chief among the city gods and spirit officials of that locality. The talismans and decrees are issued with divine authority, and their efficacy in driving and subduing malevolent spirits is unparalleled, reaching even to the farthest corners.\n\nWhen entering a certain state, county, or village, and a particular person’s household, to seize and capture the restless spirits, curses, and thieving ghosts—such is the practice. The decrees follow the prescribed rituals as outlined above.\n\nThe Most High Lao Dao/Way’s method to sever curses includes five talismans. Two of these are contained within this incantation, which demonstrates their efficacy. The remaining three are found in the *Sanbu* (三部) miscellaneous talismans—primarily within the *Zhèngyī* (正一, Orthodox Unity) *Sanbu*, not the *Língbǎo* (灵宝, Numinal Treasure) *Sanbu*. In the world, there exist the *Língbǎo* *Sanbu* miscellaneous talismans, the *Tàixuān* (太玄, Supreme Mysterious) *Sanbu* miscellaneous talismans, the *Liùjiǎ* (六甲) *Sanbu* miscellaneous talismans, the *Liùrén* (六壬) *Sanbu* miscellaneous talismans, and the *Liùdīng* (六丁) *Sanbu* miscellaneous talismans, among others. All these are compiled by the Most High Lao Dao/Way, totaling seventy-two volumes, and are also included in the *Lǎojūn Zhèngzhuàn* (老君正传, Lao Dao/Way’s True Transmission).\n\nThe two talismans of divine efficacy are detailed in this text. The remaining three are noted in the previous section. All talismans within these volumes are inscribed in red.\n\nThe following talisman treats those afflicted by curses and suffering from extreme exhaustion and emaciation. When swallowed, it alleviates their condition. One should ingest it daily.\n\nThe following talisman slays curses, restless spirits, and pests. Prepare it by writing on a clean, white tablet, mixing with water in a pure basin, and placing it before the afflicted person. For each individual, present the talisman and cast it into the water. After seven days, if the talisman sinks, the curses, restless spirits, and pests will all perish, and the person’s illness will be cured. This efficacy is genuine; do not recklessly transmit it to others.\n\nThe decrees and talismans are also hung on doors and gateways. The talismans are inscribed according to the rituals outlined above, and their efficacy is derived from the prescribed rites.\n\nLater, the Sage Emperor instructed the Heavenly Master (天师): \"If you wish to cure the plague for all people, you may tread the *dìjì* (地纪, Earthly Boundary) three times, scatter the *Yǔbù* (禹步, Steps of Yu) nine times, and don ritual attire, wearing the *dòu* (斗, Dipper) as your garment, so that your form resembles the Northern Dipper—this is the true Dipper Sovereign. Turn toward the *Tiān Guān* (天关, Heavenly Pass) and point in the direction of the afflicted person’s dwelling. Then recite the *Bāguà* (八卦, Eight Trigrams) incantation once.\n\nThe *Bāguà* incantation reads:\n*Qián zūn yào líng* (乾尊耀灵, The Heavenly Trigram is revered, its brilliance is sacred),\n*Kūn shùn nèi róng* (坤顺内荣, The Earthly Trigram is compliant, its inner grace flourishes),\nand so on.\n\nThen, seated, write the five talismans to sever curses and give them to the afflicted person to swallow or wear as an amulet, specifying the number of days by which their illness will be cured. When the days are up, the illness will indeed be cured—this method is highly efficacious.\n\n**The Method to Sever Plagues for Officials and Commoners**\nLao Dao/Way said: \"The plague’s *qi* (毒之气) harms all beings. When one person contracts the *qi*, it can kill ten others. When ten people are infected by its *qi*, they can spread and kill up to a hundred. Thus, there are many deaths. When one dies, ten others grieve for them. In the world, this is called the *wúyì bìng* (无义病, Plague of Injustice)—it does not discriminate between noble and ignoble, good and evil. Those who contract it rarely survive.\n\nSince one person’s death leads to ten others grieving, and from ancient times to today, such cases are often seen, I often fear that those who practice the Dao may be afflicted, causing others to grieve. Therefore, I have issued this chapter to prevent disasters and malevolent spirits.\n\nI possess nineteen talismans, and among those that can cure this plague, they are efficacious. If one has contracted the illness, swallowing this talisman will bring about a great cure in three days, and a minor cure on the very same day.\n\nThis talisman is the Most High Lao Dao/Way’s personal transmission to the Yellow Emperor, who practiced it and preserved it. It has been passed down through generations to this day. This is its original text, and it is highly efficacious.\n\nThe two talismans of divine efficacy are inscribed in this volume. The first talisman, when worn by the unill, and kept near the afflicted person during sitting or sleeping, prevents the illness from spreading. The first talisman, when swallowed by the afflicted person, causes sweat to break out and brings about a minor cure that very day, and a great cure within three days.\n\nThe following talisman is for the afflicted person to swallow. The following talisman is for the unill to wear, sharing sleeping and sitting spaces without risk of contagion.\n\n**Lao Dao/Way’s Great Talisman**\nIts length is one *chǐ* (尺) eight *cùn* (寸). At its base is a decree that reads:\n*\"Lǎojūn shénfú* (老君神符, Lao Dao/Way’s Divine Talisman),\ncontrols the five *guǐwáng* (鬼王, Ghost Kings) of the *Wǔbù* (五部, Five Departments)—*Liú Yuándá* (刘元达), *Zhāng Yuànbó* (张元伯), *Zhào Gōngmíng* (赵公明), *Shǐ Wényè* (史文业), and *Zhōng Shìjì* (钟仕季)—\nalong with the *Wǔgǒu* (五蛊, Five Pestilential Spirits), the *Bǎidú* (百毒, Hundred Poisons), and the *Huángnú Bósāng* (黄奴伯桑, Yellow Slave Bossang),\nas well as the vulgar *Liùdīng* (六丁) ghosts.\nThose who obtain it will be decapitated at the waist,\nwithout regard for past transgressions.\n*Jíjí rúlìng* (急急如律令, Swiftly, as the decree commands).\nThis decree is also inscribed beneath the Great Talisman,\nand hung on the main gate.\"\n\n**Lao Dao/Way’s Method for Severing Pestilence**\n\nThis talisman lies within the *Three Departments* (三部) of miscellaneous talismans, so its full text is not recorded here. Among the *Three Departments* of miscellaneous talismans is a separate chapter for severing and prohibiting plagues (断禁瘟), and the talisman’s text must be carefully sought.\n\nLater sage-rulers possess a grand chapter for severing plagues (断瘟大章), which, when appended above this chapter, will cause all cases of *kǒu wēn* (口瘟, oral plague) to vanish immediately. Before using this chapter, one must observe a period of abstinence from meat and strong flavors for three-five days (三五日), or three-seven days (三七日), or four-seven days (四七日), five-seven days (五七日), six-seven days (六七日), or seven-seven days (七七日) for a great expulsion. If one strictly observes abstinence for a hundred days beforehand, the efficacy will be even more potent.\n\nThis chapter is found in the upper register of *Jīnsuǒ Liúzhū* (《金锁流珠》), not fully included in this book. The chapter itself is in the first volume of *Jīnsuǒ Liúzhū*, comprising ten sheets of paper, already inscribed and not recorded here. To invoke this chapter, follow the established method.\n\nLao Dao/Way speaks: *\"To sever pestilence, one must first obtain the name of the afflicted person, along with their residence—state, county, village, or neighborhood (郭言坊). The year, month, and day when they contracted the plague, and the severity of their illness: whether they were infected by a pestilential *guǐwáng* (鬼王, Ghost King) or *qi* (气), or whether they died or remain gravely ill. If they died, state ‘dead’ (死); if they did not, state ‘grave’ (重). After a certain span of months and days, another person is afflicted, and one fears a continuous chain of infections. I humbly beg the Great Dao/Way for compassion and request an order of prohibition for each case. I await the judgment of the Dao/Way and the officials (判). Now, another person is infected in succession. All details must be written as in the official report, with the Dao/Way’s officials issuing their judgment.*\n\n*Once completed, inscribe the talisman in vermilion (朱书符) within a purified chamber (净室), reciting three times while tracing the ground (蹑地纪), and three times while invoking the *Fēitiān Gāng* (飞天纲, Heavenly Skybound Decree). Afterward, perform the *Yǔbù* (禹步, Steps of Yu) three times—three steps, nine traces (三步九迹)—left and right, then once more, totaling two sets of steps. Then recite the incantation:*\n\n*'I rely upon the Three-Five (三五) and the Arcane Below (魁魁之下), where ten thousand ghosts and myriad spirits are all my servants to summon. All malicious and malevolent *jīngxié* (精邪, malevolent essences) and ghosts beneath the heavens submit to death beneath the Heavenly Skybound Decree, motionless and inert. The wicked hide in vain, officials dissolve them, slanderers are silenced, and the afflicted swiftly recover. Chì-chì-chì! Swiftly, as the decree commands (急急如律令).'*\n\n*Once the incantation is finished, write the talisman. When the talisman is complete, pinch the pestilential ghost’s eye (捻瘟鬼目)—the eye is on the fourth finger of the left hand, at the third joint, where the scar of a blade is marked. Pinching it causes the ghost to die; this method is highly efficacious and auspicious (吉). Send it far to permanently sever the pestilence. If the ghost refuses to sever, invoke the *Dàchì Zhāng* (大赤章, Great Vermilion Chapter) to decapitate it, ensuring the ghost’s death and the person’s survival—this is also highly efficacious.*\n\n*This plague must never be treated by monks’ incantations or magical rites (咒术加持); otherwise, the ghosts will not submit and may even retaliate with harm. In ancient times, the Wu King (吴王) Sun Quan (孙权) suffered this affliction in his inner palace. A monk named Fa Chao (法超) arrived from the Western lands, renowned for his incantations, and when he invoked them, he was slain by the ghosts. The fifth monk died, and among the hundreds afflicted in the palace, all perished as well. Therefore, all manner of talismans and decrees must be dispatched to distant states to capture and subdue the malevolent ghosts and spirits.*\n\nLao Dao/Way instructs the Yellow Emperor (黄帝): *\"If you wish to summon ghosts (追鬼), inscribe their names on the talisman. The *Tàishàng* (太上, Supreme Sage) refers to the current decree (牒帖). In ancient times, this was called the *Tiānfú* (天符, Heavenly Talisman), invoked by both humans and ghosts. Now, humans recognize it as the Great Dao/Way’s talisman, while ghosts still call it the Heavenly Talisman as before.*\n\n*To execute this talisman, each method and incantation must be followed precisely, as the techniques for summoning, interrogating, capturing, and expelling ghosts differ. Summoning is swiftest through water and fire. The Emperor inquires: ‘How does one know the ghost’s name?’ Lao Dao/Way replies: ‘Simply have the afflicted write their statement (作辞) saying: “My illness has persisted for so many days without improvement, and all medical treatments have failed. A malevolent ghost or spirit has afflicted me; I beg for the Great King’s pursuit and interrogation.” The Yellow Emperor then declares: ‘Order the Daoist to conceal and the officials to judge, and so forth.’*\n\n*Across the Nine Regions (九州), the land spirits and local deities (灵祇) have evolved. In ancient times, there were only *Tiānshén Dìzhǐ* (天神地祇, Heavenly Gods and Earthly Spirits), with no shrines or temples. In the middle ages, there were *zuǒshè yòujì* (左社右稷, Left Communal Altars and Right Grain Offerings), but still no formal shrines or temples. From the Han, Wei, Jin, and Song dynasties onward, there were established *shèjì shén guān* (社稷神官, Communal and Grain Offering Deities). Later, during the Qi, Liang, Chen, and Sui dynasties, the *chénghuáng shén guān* (城隍神官, City Gods and Wall Deities) emerged. By the decree of later sage-rulers, the Daoist officials (法师) oversee the summoning and judgment, and these talismans are called *Miaozhí Fú* (庙直符, Temple Rectification Talismans). The City Gods and Wall Deities assist in summoning and interrogating, passing the talismans through their respective domains as officials pass decrees through counties and states, to sever deceit and capture malevolent spirits. This is the Dao/Way’s supreme method for nurturing humanity and binding ghosts, driving dragons and commanding spirits. It originates from the Celestial Palace (上天宫阙) and is transmitted through the ages to those with lofty aspirations (有道之志人).*\n\n*Once summoned, the ghost’s name is revealed, and the Daoist issues the decree, ordering the illness to subside within a certain number of days. The ghosts are then prohibited from entering the *Dìyù* (地狱, Underworld Prison), which, in ancient times, was drawn on the earth as a prison (画地为狱). Three concentric lines formed the prison, confining guilty ghosts within. After ten or five days, they would submit to their punishment. Once the term is fulfilled, their sentence is carried out: the severely guilty are executed, and they do not escape, while those not deserving death remain confined. Thus, it is called the Underworld Prison (地狱). Later generations, misunderstanding the ritual timing, falsely claim there is an Underworld Prison beneath the earth where punishments are severe, misleading the world and inviting great retribution upon themselves. Now, Daoist practitioners affix talismans to communal altars and temples to prohibit ghosts, following the ancient method of drawing prisons on the earth. Once the illness subsides, the talisman is removed, and the ghosts are released, with the decree stating: ‘From this day onward, never again shall you cause harm; if you do, you will be executed.’*\n\nLao Dao/Way says: *\"When inscribing talismans and decrees to be dispatched thousands of *lǐ* (里) away or within ten thousand *lǐ*, first complete the talisman and decree without sealing or stamping them. Then perform the ritual in a purified chamber (净室), tracing the ground three times (蹑地纪), and executing the *Yǔbù* (禹步) three times—three steps, nine traces—while donning ritual attire (配衣), turning the *Tiānguān* (天关, Heavenly Barrier), and pointing in the direction of the afflicted. Focus your mind and visualize the person thousands of *lǐ* away, directly addressing the official responsible for that day’s *liùjiǎ lúnrì* (六甲轮日, hexagram cycle of days).*\n\nNow, take the talisman and decree, entrusting them to the Heavenly Gods, Earthly Spirits, Dragons, and Ghosts. In this age, it is unnecessary to invoke the Heavenly Gods and Earthly Spirits explicitly—simply dispatch them to the local shrines and temples, which will suffice. In recent times, the City Gods (城隍) have been established with full efficacy, and their methods are highly verified.\n\nIssue the decree to the magistrate of a certain prefecture or commandery, ordering the capture of a certain ghost or malevolent spirit. If the illness improves swiftly and the matter is resolved, the decree must be executed promptly. Once the order is fulfilled and the report received, pinch the *dūjiān* (都监) talisman with your thumb—*dūjiān* refers to the first joint of the first finger on your left hand.\n\n**Method for Dispatching a Decree to Distant Relatives to Ensure Their Safety and Receive News**\n\nLao Dao/Way says: *\"When a practitioner of the Dao earnestly aspires to cultivate but has not yet attained mobility, yet has relatives in another state, and wishes to know their well-being or their moral conduct—good or ill—simply write a decree and entrust it to the Earthly Spirits (地祇). The Earthly Spirits of today are the City Gods (城隍) and the deities of local shrines and temples. Command the official of the day to deliver it, demanding a response within two days. For distances beyond a thousand *lǐ*, specify two days. For distances within ten thousand *lǐ*, specify five days, without delay or hesitation. Some may say five days for all cases.\n\nAfter inscribing the talisman and decree, trace the ground three times (蹑地纪), execute the *Yǔbù* (禹步) in nine traces, don ritual attire (配衣), turn the *Tiānguān* (天关), and point toward the direction of the relative’s residence—this is the dwelling place of a certain individual, say, *Yǐ* (乙), who is my Daoist servant, *Xuán* (玄), a relative.\"*\n\n「Or it may be an uncle or cousin—brothers, aunts, or other such relatives—whose names must be specified. Both good and evil deeds are fully reported; the talisman is sealed with the *niǎnxīng* (捻星) invocation. The invocation is held in the left hand’s fourth finger at its first joint.\n\nUntil nightfall, constantly observe the celestial region corresponding to the relative’s dwelling. If a star suddenly flies away, it signifies that the Heavenly Dao (天地) has dispatched a messenger to investigate there, who will then report back. The report must be true. If no star disperses into that region’s celestial division, the report will surely be false and cannot be trusted. You must reattempt the ritual—then the truth will be revealed.\n\nIf there are stars at night, observe them carefully. If stars disperse toward that direction, the report will certainly be true.\n\nLater sages and rulers have decreed: The threefold tracing of the ground (*cèdìjì* 蹑地纪) stirs the *Tiānguān* (天关). When the *Tiānguān* dispatches a messenger to inspect and report, the account is true. If no star is sent to investigate, the report will be false—this is the deception of the talisman deities or officials. You must then reattempt the ritual, summoning the talisman deities and officials to question them again before sending the messenger. The saying goes: *\"The talisman officials, if they do not follow the prescribed ritual, must be punished according to the severity of the crime.\"* The punishment begins with the celestial decree (*kējué* 科决) ten times; once completed, it is highly efficacious—do not speak of it lightly, and always keep it secret.\n\n**Ritual for the Sovereign to Subdue Ominous Stars, Portents, and Malevolent *Yìqì* (异气) Before Disaster Strikes**\n\n*Lǎojūn* (老君) says: When ominous stars appear, portents will surely follow. Stars are the \"children of the sun\" (日生), hence the upper character is *rì* (日, \"sun\") and the lower is *shēng* (生, \"life/child\"). Thus, the sages say: *\"Stars are rebellious; they will cause ministers to betray their sovereigns, sons to defy their fathers, and disciples to abandon their teachers.\"* Such rebellious winds are often seen in this world. When the heavens display crimson *qì* (气), it is called an evil portent. These two phenomena presage the betrayal of ministers and their early demise.\n\nThe heavens, knowing of such evil portents, reveal them to mortals. Among humans, those skilled in Daoist arts (*dàoshù* 道术) can subdue them for the state—once they are ordered, these stars will not manifest. Thus, the ruler and ministers will have no worries.\n\nIf they are unaware or fail to act, the stars will appear again, aiding the state in attacking and subduing them early—this is the first great merit. When the celestial reward for this merit is complete, the practitioner ascends in broad daylight to the clouds, becoming a transcendent *xiānzhēn* (仙真).\n\nThose who understand the Dao know this. They must avoid betrayal.\n\nIf there are Daoist practitioners (*zhìdào* 志道) within this realm, and they see the stars and *qì* descending upon their region, they must quickly leave to avoid it—this brings great fortune. Never dwell in that direction, lest these Daoists lose their Way.\n\nMoreover, it is said that the *Lǐ* (李) family, inheriting the sovereign’s Daoist legacy, passed down this secret merit through generations. The heavens granted them this legacy.\n\nIf the ruler is virtuous, he will share this merit with them. *\"Lǐshēn\"* (僭申) refers to those who practice the Dao: they borrow the method of peaceful abode to aid the state, which is the later ritual.\n\nIf the ruler lacks virtue, the practitioner will change his lineage and hide his identity. He will flee to another realm, conceal his name, and this is called the *zhìrén* (志人) method for averting ominous stars.\n\n*Lǎojūn* (老君) instructs: With abstinence from meat and purification of the heart (*sùshí zhāixīn*), the mind steadies, the Daoist resolve (*zhàizhèngxīnshén*) aligns the spirit. Thus, one must purify the heart. Reside in a separate chamber for three days, avoiding women for seven days; women must also avoid men for seven days.\n\nThen, trace the ground (*cèdìjì* 蹑地纪) five times, and perform the *Tiāngāo* (天纲) once—this is the proper order. Execute the *Yǔbù* (禹步) three times: one cycle of three steps (九迹), two cycles of twelve steps (十二迹), and three cycles of fifteen steps (十五迹), before descending outside.\n\nRecite the *Dìjì* (地纪) Great Incantation (*dàzhòu* 大咒) eighteen times, don ritual attire (*pèiyī*), turn the *Tiānguān* (天关), and point toward the target. Repeat this process daily for seven days, three times each day—at dawn, noon, and dusk—for a total of twenty-one cycles. The stars will then fall, the malevolence disperse, and the state will suffer no calamity.\n\nSuch practitioners bring great merit to the state, ensuring the people’s peace and boundless blessings. Ominous stars and malevolent *qì* will be extinguished. Even if some residual *qì* lingers briefly, it will collapse within a year and a half, vanishing on its own.\n\nThis method, when applied, also requires the invocation (*niǎnxīng*). Twist the talisman toward the direction observed, determining whether it aligns with *metal* (金), *wood* (木), *water* (水), *fire* (火), or *earth* (土), and invoke accordingly.\n\nLater sages and rulers commanded the *Jiǔtiān Xuánnǚ* (九天玄女, \"Mysterious Woman of the Nine Heavens\") to descend and personally transmit the *Tenth Volume of the Outer Canon of the Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl* (*Jīnsuǒ Liúzhū Wàipiān* 第十卷, *金锁流珠外篇*), detailing the talismans and diagrams for the nine regions and ten Daoist circuits of myriad states. She taught this to *Lǐ Shìyè Jìng* (李仆射靖), who served as the Right Comrade of State (右仆射) and used divine communication to aid the state in military affairs, ensuring the people’s security with unwavering loyalty. He was thus honored as the *Shénjiàng* (神将, \"Divine General\"), commanding the *yīnbīng* (阴兵, \"Yin-forces\").\n\n*Jìng* (靖) used his divine arts to assist the state and protect the people, and the sages’ grace bestowed upon him the title of Divine General. **Note:** Already detailed in *Liúzhū* (流珠); no need to repeat here.\n\n*Lǎojūn* (老君) says: This method is called the *Luòxīng* (落星) Ritual—it knows only the method of ominous stars and removes them. There is no need to inquire about the names or lineages of those below.\n\nThis teaching reflects the *Tàishàng* (太上) Lord’s compassionate heart: seeing only the ominous stars in the heavens, he removes them for the state’s sake, without concern for the names or regions of those below. Thus, the Great Sage’s intent and compassionate words seek not to know of these individuals, hence this instruction. It is meant to guide the virtuous and noble, great regional lords, loyal ministers, and valiant generals, urging them to cultivate loyal and filial resolve, to honor and serve the heavens without wavering.\n\nIf the ominous stars are unseen in the heavens and the local *tǔdì* (土地, \"Earthly Deities\") are without malevolence, then no disaster will arise. The state will flourish, the people will be at peace, and the merit will be boundless. Often, those who act thus will ascend in daylight, attaining the rank of *Tàiqīng Zhēnrén* (太清真人, \"Perfect Person of Supreme Clarity\").\n\n**Ritual for Officials of Prefectures and Counties to Sever Disasters, Malevolent Portents, and Disturbances in Households and Families**\n\n*Lǎojūn* (老君) says: Common folk, regardless of rank, are all subject to malevolent *qì*, which may violently disrupt them, manifest as strange lights, or possess them through false apparitions. It may strike at household doors, burn dwellings, inflict illness, steal possessions, or frighten poultry and dogs. It may send venomous snakes, rats, foxes, or insects, and countless other spirits, beasts, and strange objects—all manner of blood and water entities—that invade homes as malevolent disturbances. These cannot be enumerated exhaustingly here.»\n\nBut the malevolent *qì* of myriad disasters and disturbances—those that come to terrify and afflict people—must all be countered with written talismans (*fú*), which shall forever banish them. Three talismans are recorded here. The remaining talismans are found in the *Sān Bù Záwén* (三部杂文, \"Three Sections of Miscellaneous Texts\"), which shall be examined and extracted as needed.\n\nOnce the talismans are inscribed, the ritual commands: tread the *Jìdì* (蹑地) three times, recite the *Sān Bèi* (纪, \"Three Invocations\") three times, and perform the *Yǔbù* (禹步) three steps with nine traces. When finished, don the ritual attire, invoke the *Tiānguān* (天关), and with the left hand point toward the household of the afflicted three times. This is to summon the talisman’s power to suppress the malevolent *qì* and disturbances within that family, causing them to exhale a purple cloud and depart from the home.\n\nThen, divide and deliver the talisman to the designated *Yīnchāi* (引差) official or *Liùjiǎ* (六甲) deity of the day. The talisman shall be entrusted to the *Liùjiǎ* (六甲) deity of the day or the *Dìshén* (日神) of the *Liùjiǎ* (六甲) cycle. Present the talisman.\n\nIf the inscribed talisman is small, its power alone shall suffice to banish the disturbance. If it is large, then the talisman shall be carried as a written decree (*tiēdié*) to halt the affliction, and the effect shall not exceed one hundred days.\n\nShould the malevolent *qì* persist in its disturbances, one must then take the decree and bind the offending entity, driving it beyond the boundaries of the world. If it returns, it shall be executed without fail. Thus, malevolent disturbances shall be forever eradicated.\n\n**Talisman for Severing a Hundred Disturbances**\nThis talisman suppresses ill-omened disturbances within a dwelling—such as spectral lights, vengeful spirits, and malevolent dogs that shrink their noses and ascend to beds; boiling wells; venomous snakes and insects; or the sight of bloodied mice. The talisman shall be employed to decapitate these disturbances.\n\n*Lǎojūn* (老君) instructed *Luó Wénqiáng Tiānshī* (罗文强天师, \"Master Luo Wénqiáng of the Celestial Dao\"):\n\n\"For disturbances caused by beasts, dragons, snakes, or *qiáng* (蛟), hang this talisman on a wooden board and affix it to a bamboo pole, raising it to a height of one *zhàng* (丈) two *chǐ* (尺). Within no more than ten days, the malevolent entity shall die, and none shall dare harm others. If the disturbance stems from *guǐshén* (鬼神, \"ghostly deities\"), then a higher decree of *Chìzhāng* (赤章, \"Red Document\") must be inscribed and executed to sever the affliction permanently.\"\n\nThe *Hòushèngjūn* (后圣君, \"Later Sage-King\") further instructed the *Tiānshī* (天师):\n\n\"When dragons or *qiáng* (蛟) disturb a household, the Sage-King shall personally issue a decree. The decree shall summon the spirits of the Five Peaks (*Wǔyuè* 五岳), the Four Great Waters (*Sìshè* 四渎), the regional deities of the Nine Provinces (*Jiǔzhōu* 九州), and the communal shrines (*shèmiào* 社庙) to form a united barrier at the thresholds, pooling their strength to capture and drive the malevolent entity.\n\nOnce done, the Sage-King shall ascend to the *Tiānguān* (天关), invoke the *Tiāngāng* (天纲), and seal the earthly gateways (*dìhù*). The ritual procedure is as follows: the *Tiānshì* (天式, \"Celestial Pattern\"), *Dìshì* (地式, \"Earthly Pattern\"), * Léigōng* (雷公, \"Thunder Lord\"), *Liùrén* (六壬, \"Sixth *Rén* Day\"), *Liùjiǎ* (六甲, \"Sixth *Jiǎ* Day\"), and the Four Seasons (*Sìshí* 四时)—these seven patterns shall be employed in concert to capture and expel the malevolent entity.\n\nThe Sage-King shall issue the decree as *Kǎozhào Tiānshī* (考召天师, \"Summoning Master\"), ascending to the threshold and invoking the *Tiāngāng* (天纲) while performing the *Yǔbù* (禹步). Having donned the ritual attire and invoked the *Tiānguān* (天关), he shall march no more than twenty *lǐ* (里), and within ten *lǐ*, the dragon or *qiáng* shall be captured and brought before him.\n\nThen, perform the *Yǔbù* (禹步) three steps with nine traces three times, and advance with a mighty shout. When finished, grasp the blade (*dāozhī* 刀支) and behead the malevolent entity into two segments, thereby annihilating it permanently. This method is highly efficacious.\n\nPerform the *Jìdì* (蹑地) and *Yǔbù* (禹步) each three times, completing all three iterations. Before each iteration, recite the mighty shout. When finished, issue the great cry anew.\n\nRegardless of whether the disturbance originates in water or land, the Sage-King shall not personally transform or ascend to confront it. Instead, he shall rely upon the power of the earthly domain (*wéidì* 威地) and borrow the strength of the Dao to achieve this feat. The efficacy is profound.\n\nBut know this: when the Sage-King issues the decree, the ritual shall proceed in sequence. In the *Jìn* (晋) dynasty, *Xǔ Xùn* (许逊) performed this ritual, ascending to the heavens in broad daylight, and the heavens and earth rejoiced.\n\n*Lǎojūn* (老君) said:\n\n\"Among malevolent *qì*, none surpass the dragon, for it can ascend to the heavens. Yet if humans can capture it, the malevolent *qì* shall be drawn to the *Xīngjiàn* (星剑, 'Celestial Blade'). As for the most terrifying and potent malevolent *qì*, none surpass the *qiáng* (蛟), for it can dive into water and hide. Even so, it shall be subdued by the prohibitive arts and captured within the instant.\n\nThus, the Sage-King is born of the heavens, and his potency is extraordinary. Only by refining one’s mind and calming one’s spirit, avoiding reckless action, and maintaining contemplation of the original Master, shall the ritual be perfected and the malevolent *qì* utterly eradicated.\n\nThe blade (*dāozhī* 刀支) for the water deity, water dragon, and *qiáng* (蛟) is located on the left hand’s third finger, on the third node, to the right side. Bind it with crimson silk, and release it on the day the malevolent entity dies.\n\nSevering one dragon or *qiáng* shall yield three thousand times the merit. Ascending to the heavens in daylight, one attains the rank of *Dàxiān Zhēnrén* (大仙真人, 'Perfect Person of Great Immortality').\n\nThis method has been passed down through generations, with Daoists employing it to benefit the world and eliminate disturbances.\n\n**Ritual for Daoists to Sever Malevolent Disturbances for Households and Families**\n\n*Lǎojūn* (老君) says:\n\n\"In the world, households and families are often wrongfully afflicted by malevolent disturbances, causing unrest and insecurity. But if the Daoist presents a sincere petition to the *Dàdào* (大道, 'Great Dao') and invokes the *Kǎozhào* (考召) Master below, then the afflicted shall kneel and offer the petition. The Master shall employ the ritual to read the petition.\n\nIn later times, the *Hòushèngjūn* (后圣君) altered the command to compose a formal accusation (*zhàng*), and Daoists shall present their petitions accordingly. Officials and commoners shall submit true accusations as petitions, and the Master shall judge the accusations.\n\nOnce the judgment is complete, the *Kǎozhào* Master shall deliver the verdict, banish the malevolent entity, and issue the talisman. The current decree shall be written as a talisman.\n\nThe decree shall command: 'Bind and restrain the entity causing the disturbance, and it shall be immediately severed.' The talisman is found in the 'Miscellaneous Talismans' (*Záshìfú* 杂符文), and it is not fully recorded here.\n\nIf the petitioned entity refuses, then the Master shall employ the *Jìdì* (蹑地) three times and invoke the *Fēitiāngāng* (飞天纲) once. Another version states:\n\n'When performing the ritual, the general method is to recite the *Jìdì* (蹑地) without using the *Fēitiāngāng* (飞天纲). Perform the *Yǔbù* (禹步) after dispersing the power, and no other methods shall be employed. After dispersing the power, don the ritual attire, invoke the *Tiānguān* (天关) and point toward the afflicted, then recite the eighteen *zhòu* (咒) of the *Shíbāpiān* (十八篇). The malevolent entity shall be annihilated at the Master’s command, and it shall never again cause disaster.'\n\n*Lǎojūn* (老君) instructed *Huángdì* (黄帝):\n\n\"For the common folk who desire life, employ the *Bǎiguài Jié* (捻百怪诀). The incantation is inscribed beneath the nail of the left hand’s thumb, and one shall invoke it with the right hand’s thumb.\n\n[End of] the *Jīnsuǒ Liúzhū Yǐn* (金锁流珠引) [scroll], the twenty-fifth.\n[End of] the *Jīnsuǒ Liúzhū Yǐn* (金锁流珠引) [scroll], the twenty-sixth.\"\n\nThe **Great True Sage of Zhōnghuá**, the **Celestial Sovereign** Zàiwáng Fāngpíng, **Zhang Daoling**, **Zhào Shēngwáng**, **Cháng Sīmìng**, **Lǐ Zhòngfǔ**, **Máo Yíng**, **Xǔ Yùfǔ**, and others—**successive compilers**—\n**Li Chunfeng**, the **Immortal of Zhōnghuá**, annotated.\n**A ritual for kings and emperors to offer to the Great Primordial Celestial Wagon (Dàyuánchēn), the Five Tombs, to reverse death and bring rebirth, to dispel illness and ensure peace—fulfilling one’s wishes.**\n\nThis is the **later sage, Master Lǐ**, who transmitted it to the **Celestial Master Zhang Daoling**.\n\nThe **Emperor of the Golden Threshold (Tàipíng Jīnquè)** and the **Morning Sovereign (Dìchén)**, the **Later Sage (Hòushèng)**, the **Primordial High Dao Lord (Xuányuán Shàngdàojūn)**, instructed the **Celestial Master Zhang Daoling**:\n\n*\"All human lives have their measure of longevity and death, allotted by the Celestial Bureaucracy (Tiāncháo) and the Underworld Tribunals (Dìfǔ). Even the lowliest commoners belong to these authorities—how much more so kings, emperors, and great lords!\n\nIf one falls gravely ill or meets sudden calamity, then let the **Great Primordial Celestial Wagon (Dàyuánchēn) and the Five Tombs (Wǔmù)** be invoked to dispel the crisis, reverse illness, and grant the **Great Chapter of Reversing Death and Bringing Rebirth**.\n\nShould one’s fate be exhausted and life’s term reached—such exhaustion of fate is indeed common. In the second year of **Hàn Ān**, on the fifth day of the seventh month, the Emperor was touring **Nánshān**. Along the path, he encountered an old man who reported to him:\n\n*'Your Majesty, return swiftly! On the fifteenth of this month, at noon, the **Pursuing Officials (Zhuīshǐ)** will come to escort you. You shall not return.*\n\n*'Return to Cháng’ān at once! Seek **Lǐ Shàojūn** and present the **Primordial Celestial Wagon Chapter** and the **Five Tombs Chapter of Reversing Death and Bringing Rebirth**. Only then will you be able to return to the Central Kingdom. If you do not act, you shall depart forever.'*\n\nThe Emperor, hearing this, was greatly alarmed. He turned and walked a hundred paces, then looked back—no trace of the old man remained. He ordered his attendants to search and summon him. The Emperor then asked: *'Who are you, official?'*\"\n\nThe old man replied: *\"It is the Golden Star. Lǐ Shàojūn is a Great Immortal. Only he can present the Chapter and move the Heavenly Sovereign with his profound virtue—he will surely be granted permission. Others cannot.\"*\n\nThe Emperor commanded his attendants to hasten and seek him out. They found him on the thirteenth day and ordered him to present the Great Chapter. After two recitations, the Emperor fell gravely ill on the fourteenth day, his life hanging by a thread. On the fifteenth day, the Pursuing Officials appeared in a dream to the Emperor, and he was granted an additional nine years as ruler.\n\nAt that time, a celestial decree descended, stating: *\"You have obtained Lǐ Shàojūn’s Chapter of the Minor Lord, also known as Xuanzi—this is Shàojūn himself. Now present the Great Chapter of the Primordial Celestial Wagon and the Five Tombs of Reversing Death and Bringing Rebirth. You will thereby extend your lifespan, augment your celestial blessings, and be granted a new birth as a human king and sovereign lord. The earlier annotations explain this fully.\"*\n\nThe Heavenly Master imparted this Chapter, originally composed in three scrolls, which roughly aligns with the Lord Lao’s Great Chapter in minor variations but with many added benefits. This is the version now practiced in the world.\n\nThe Lord Lao instructed the Divine Farmer Emperor: *\"Though humans have a natural lifespan, many do not fulfill it. Out of a hundred, eighty or ninety will not reach their destined years—these are the unlucky ones. Why? Because human decline brings calamity, and those with little fortune will succumb to it. If fortune is abundant, it will surpass the natural limit. Beyond decline and calamity, there are those who, through harsh and violent deeds, invite their own deaths—is this not due to human actions?*\n\n*My own immortality comes from reciting these Chapters to ward off calamity, dispel decline, and preserve life and vitality. The lifespan that can be extended is thus granted, and I passed these writings to the Divine Farmer. The Divine Farmer, with his resolve to nurture life and protect vitality, possessed the nature of the Great Dao. He tested medicines to save people, used Chapters to rescue others from calamity, and compiled the Divine Farmer’s ancient texts into three scrolls: the first on Reversing Death, the second on Removing Malevolent Influences, and the third on the Auspicious Hours—this is the Chapter addressed to the Heavenly Sovereign.*\n\n*The Lord Lao said: ‘I also taught the Divine Farmer the Step of the Dry Cloud as the method for reciting the Chapters. This is the same as the ‘Walking on the Earth’ rhythm, later known as the Yu Step—this is the Dry Cloud Step. It not only saves oneself but also brings longevity. Later, I instructed my disciples to practice this method of rescue and salvation, which was passed down through generations as the Dry Cloud lineage, never broken. Now, when reciting this Chapter, one must perform the Step of the Dry Cloud, manipulate the incantations, and summon the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water to release and redeem the soul and spirit, only then may one present the Chapter to the Heavenly Sovereign and beg for an extended term—thus achieving rebirth and transcending all decline and calamity, even if one’s time has come, one will still be reborn.*\n\n*Lǐ Shàojūn has already rescued hundreds who were near death, and his disciples have long used the Dry Cloud Step to save others, all regaining their lives. The ritual states: First, issue the written Chapter. The Chapter is a declaration. When summoning the Master of the Ritual, he must first declare the Chapter, then notify the gods of the Five Mountains and Four Seas, the Nine Provinces’ ancestral shrines and community officials, and command them to first rescue and treat the afflicted, making sure to present it to the Heavenly Sovereign before the Chapter’s recitation and treatment, thus attaining approval and reaching the desired effect.*\n\n*After the Master of the Ritual receives the Chapter, he seals it with the ancestral shrines and presents it together, ordering the illness to retreat swiftly. If the illness retreats within the set days, then he must perform the ‘Walking on the Earth’ rhythm three times, dress in ceremonial robes, and turn the Heavenly Gate, always pointing to the afflicted’s palace or residence. The illness will then retreat immediately. After presenting to the Heavenly Sovereign, the illness gradually improves. Within three days, manipulate the incantations of the Chief Inspector and others, including the ‘Heavenly Heart Incantation’ and the ‘Earthly Heart Incantation.’ These three incantations are used in the ritual to seal the Chapter and prohibit the calamity.*\n\n*The incantations are found within the *Palm of Incantations*. The Heavenly Master said: ‘When the Son of Heaven presents a Chapter, he must use sincerity to govern all things. The earlier decree mentions a thousand bolts of silk and twenty stones of gold, all of which are separate ceremonial offerings for the Chapter. This Chapter does not require additional inscriptions. After presenting the Chapter, within three days there will be a report. These reports are all false, using different words to convey the message, not the actual words.*\n\n*Why? Because the Son of Heaven is of the utmost reverence, so his reports come from the Heavenly Tribunals and Earthly Registries, not in actual words. If humans were to know these false reports before the matter was approved, they might spread baseless claims. Therefore, the report uses hidden words and deep meanings, not allowing common people to know. This is the method of the Heavenly Tribunals’ reports. It is done thus.*\n\n*For the method of presenting the Great Chapter of the Primordial Celestial Wagon and the Five Tombs of Reversing Death and Bringing Rebirth to the lords of great and minor states, three-ranked and five-ranked officials, and others of high rank, the illness will be swiftly removed, and the afflicted will attain peace and safety as desired. For commoners who follow the diagram and believe in the Chapter, their illnesses will be reduced by a tenth, taking one part out of ten.*\n\n*The Lord Lao said: ‘The minor states’ lords are the sires and kings—today’s prefectural officials. Among these lords, there are ranks of high and low. For those suffering from severe calamities and illnesses, lying gravely ill upon their beds, one may first issue a written summons. The summons is like today’s sealed orders. In ancient times, the term ‘summons’ referred to a ritual seal with three stamps: the Unbeginning Five Spirits Seal, today’s Later Sage Seal. The ‘Great Sage Seal’ is the supreme seal. There is also the ‘Heavenly Tribunals Seal,’ which is the seal of the Three Heavens’ Great Sage.*\n\n*It is used to capture the Heavenly Fox and the Sacrificial Beast, as well as for the lords of minor states to treat illnesses. When receiving the talismans of the Five Deities—Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Tortoise, and Yellow Court—one uses this seal to rectify one’s true *qi*, which is employed by the Immortal Officials. The summons will prevent malevolent spirits from acting against them. Afterward, one must set a limit for a certain day when the illness will be removed and healed.*\"\n\nThe decree of the talisman shall not be written in full. If no harm is removed, then the full decree shall be written. In ancient times, this was called the *Upper Heavenly Sovereign’s Decree*. Now it is altered to read: *\"The Most Peaceful Golden Threshold Emperor, the Morning Star, the Later Sage, the Mysterious Primordial Dao Lord\"*—also called the *Jade Emperor of Heaven*—no longer bearing the title *Heavenly Sovereign*.\n\nTo the *Upper Heavenly Sovereign*, one petitions for a direct command to the Three Officials, requesting an extension of life and added years. If granted ten or twenty years, one then recites the step-curse. This follows the method of the *First Rank* in the previous section. The *Earthly Framework Step-Curse* is prepared as before, using the *Sovereign’s Method of Step-Curse*—though the written decree and talisman differ slightly. The text of the decree is separate and not detailed here; it is not recorded in its entirety. For commoners, the priest assesses their poverty or wealth, and those who can afford it take one-tenth of this decree in faith. If they cannot, they contribute according to their means, ensuring no deficiency, lest the matter fail to reach fruition.\n\n**Method to Eliminate Locust Plagues and Protect Crops from Heavenly Fire**\nThe *Venerable Lord* says: This calamity is not wrought by Heaven, but by the local earthly spirits, who fail to assist in virtue and blessings, thus allowing the disaster to arise. On a *Bing-Yin* or *Ding-Mao* day, within the chamber, tread the *Framework* three times, with the Five Stars ascending from Wood to Fire. After three cycles, turn to the Fire Star and form the *Heavenly Pass Seal* with five pathways. Repeat this three times. Upon completion, face forward and perform the *Yu-Step* three steps, nine traces. Then, with the left hand, dispatch the talisman to the four corners of the cultivated fields, marking them with a bamboo pole twelve *chi* high. Gradually, the locust plague shall dissipate. This method is of great efficacy.\n\nThe *Later Sage Lord* transmitted the *Locust Plague Method*, found in the second joint of the left middle finger. The five-pathway talisman appears in the *Lingbao Threefold Miscellaneous Talismans* and shall not be repeated here. These five pathways originate from the *Upper Pure Capital’s Forbidden Precincts*, where the *Venerable Lord* bestowed them upon Emperor Yao to benefit the world. Thereafter, locust plagues diminished. Before Yao’s reign, the Nine Regions suffered such disasters annually.\n\n**Regulations for National and Personal Dao Cultivation, Including Ritual Instruments and Ordinances**\nFrom the *Venerable Lord’s Prohibitions and Ordinances*:\n\n**Upper Rank Celestial Daoists** must wield nine swords to assist the Celestial Venerable, subdue the Nine Wilds, and sever Heavenly Demons. They are:\n1. *Equal-Body Sword*,\n2. *Purple Smoke Courtly Venerable’s Ornamental Sword*,\n3. *Soul-Subduing Sword*,\n4. *Evil-Beheading Sword*,\n5. *True-Guarding Sword*,\n6. *Spirit-Guarding Sword*,\n7. *Heaven-Inspecting Sword*,\n8. *Daoist-Inspecting Sword*,\n9. *Self-Inspecting Sword*.\nThese are the *Heavenly Treasures*, worn as talismans.\n\n**Middle Rank Immortal Daoists** use seven swords:\n1. *Equal-Body*,\n2. *Courtly Venerable*,\n3. *Demons-Subduing*,\n4. *Evil-Beheading*,\n5. *Self-Guarding*,\n6. *Spirit-Guarding*,\n7. *Heaven-Inspecting*.\n\n**Lower Rank Summoned Daoists** use six swords, corresponding to the *Six Heavenly Stems*:\n1. *Equal-Body*,\n2. *Courtly Venerable*,\n3. *Demons-Subduing*,\n4. *Evil-Beheading*,\n5. *Self-Guarding*,\n6. *Spirit-Guarding*.\nThe first governs the body; the latter five align with *Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth*.\n\nThese sword regulations also appear in the *Later Sage Lord’s Internal Title: The Venerable Lord’s True Chronology of the World*.\n\nFor **human Daoists of the Upper Law**—those with Daoist arts to benefit the world, aid the nation, and save the people—four swords suffice:\n1. *Equal-Body*,\n2. *Courtly Venerable*,\n3. *Demons-Subduing*,\n4. *Evil-Beheading*,\nfollowing the legal ordinances.\n\n**Purple-Clad Daoists** (also of the Upper Law) use three swords:\n1. *Command-Water*,\n2. *Self-Protection*,\n3. *Evil-Beheading*.\n\n**Crimson-Clad Daoists** use two swords:\n1. *Command-Water and Purify Impurities*,\n2. *Evil-Beheading*.\nThese are the Daoists of the *Mid-Autumn Forty-Nine Ranks* and *Lower Element Eighty-One Ranks*, along with the *Single Stage Heavenly Master’s Dao* for regulating *qi*. They follow the *Heavenly Master’s Later Sage Lord’s Original Rites*.\n\nIf adhering to the *Heavenly Master’s Rites*, one falls under the false rites of *Tao* and *Lu*, who claim twenty-four ranks to govern the *Twenty-Four Qi*. They also assert that the *Lower Element* follows this pattern, but this is not the practice of the *Authentic One Red-Clad Daoists*—these are the *Blue-Clad Daoists*, who have not yet attained the *Yellow-Clad* rank.\n\nAccording to the *Original Rites*, *Yellow-Clad Daoists* are granted two swords, while *Blue-* and *Green-Clad Daoists* are permitted one.\n\nThis is the teaching of *Wind the First Master*.\n\n**General Regulations for National and Personal Dao Cultivation, Including Ritual Forms and Universal Aid**\nThe *Venerable Lord* says: Those who aspire to the Dao must first master the *Universal Spirit-Saving Method*, which summons spirits and commands ghosts—its efficacy is like the response of mouth and hand. Nothing surpasses this method.\n\nThis method employs two parallel systems: *talismans* (yang forces) and *ritual diagrams* (yin forces). As the *Classics* state: *\"Talismans are the yang army; diagrams are the yin army.\"* When these yin-yang methods are applied universally—without bias or faction—the Daoist path is established, and ascension in broad daylight becomes possible. One may traverse clouds, ascend with body and spirit intact, and even carry one’s dwelling with them. Such feats have been achieved, as evidenced by *Zhang* and *Xu*.\n\nWhen both talismans and diagrams are employed, Heaven and Earth become purified. This method’s efficacy is such that Heaven, Earth, the Sun, Moon, and Stars align in clarity, and *Taiyi* commands the subordinate forces. The divisions of Heaven and Earth, the Sun and Moon, stand unshaken. Winds and clouds disperse, and the *Magician Kings* flee in submission.\n\nThis Dao is subtle and profound, ascending to the Upper Pure. **As the commandments decree, so it shall be done.**\n\nThis Dao is the **Seal-Style Talisman** and **Imperial Edict Talisman** of Lord Lao. Another saying: Seal-Style, likewise spoken of. Lord Lao said:\n\n*\"Style\"* is bestowed in ranks—\nthe highest rank for **Celestial Immortal Daoists**, who together hold **120 Styles**.\nThe middle rank for **Divine Immortal Daoists**, who together hold **81 Styles**.\nThe lowest rank for **Summoning Daoists**—\nthe ancient **Summoning Masters** of the Four Lords:\nOne Lord governs **Summoning**, one Lord governs **Orthodox Unity (Zhengyi)**, one Lord governs **Mind**,\nall overseeing the **Three Lords** of Summoning.\n\nYet today’s men fail to grasp its meaning,\nand all have altered it to **\"Orthodox Unity Daoists\"**,\nabolishing the three ranks entirely—\nthus losing the title of **Summoning Daoists**.\n\nThis is the **collective interpretation** of the three houses of **Tao (陶)**, **Lu (陆)**, and **Zhang (张)**.\nLater seekers, lacking understanding of its **great Dao’s origin**,\nlose the **resolve of the worthy**—\ntheir paths are chaotic, their nature misguided.\n\nTogether, they hold **36 Styles**.\n\nThe **Later Sage Lord** instructed **Zhang the Heavenly Master**:\n*\"As Heavenly Master, you must know the three ranks of talismans.\nThe **Ancient Celestial Sage** previously expelled the three ranks of Daoists—\ntheir Lords, ministers, officials, commoners, and lowest servants.\nNow, I command the **Son of Heaven** to use the talismans of **Celestial Immortal Daoists**,\nthe **Prime Ministers and officials** to use those of **Divine Immortal Daoists**,\nand the **nobles and commoners** to use those of **Summoning Daoists**.\nIf used correctly, the commoners may employ talismans to ward off ghosts and banish evil.\nThis is the **Six-Ren Style**.*\n\nLord Lao instructed **Lu Wenqiang (罗文强)**:\n*\"The gods of Heaven and Earth are all governed by the **Six Canons and Six Styles**.\nIf you can **reflect deeply and apply them faithfully**,\nrevering your **original master**,\nhe will never leave your side,\nteaching and guiding you—\nnothing shall remain unmastered.\nBeware of reckless action for vain gain.\nThe worthy cultivate the Dao for the sake of their **nation and family**,\ntransmit **Dharma Seals** and **salvation for beings**,\nand heal **sickness and disease**—\nthey employ the **Celestial Sage’s Ancient Seal**, the **24-Cell Seal**.\"*\n\nLord Lao said:\n*\"This Seal also has three ranks—\n**Celestial Immortal Daoists** hold **24 Seals**,\n**Divine Immortal Daoists** hold **15 Seals**,\nand **Summoning Daoists** hold **12 Seals**.\nWith Seals and talismans to **command and dispatch**,\nand **imperial edicts and documents** in use,\nthey also transmit **Dharma Seals, Seal-Passes, and Seal-Boards**,\nemploying them ceaselessly—\nexceeding even the **official seals of the court**,\ntheir use never ceases.\"*\n\nLord Lao instructed **The Celestial Sovereign Lord (天帝君)**:\n*\"The **great Dao of Seals and Talismans** is bestowed upon the three ranks of Daoists.\n**Celestial Immortal Daoists** are titled **Heavenly Officials**,\ngoverning the **36 Celestial Palaces** above.\nEach palace has **24 departments**,\nhence they hold **24 Seals**,\nto **judge the affairs** of the **24 departmental lords and officials**.\n\nThe **Later Sage Lord** established the *Statutes of the Jade Capital Mystic Capital (玉京玄都制令律)*:\n*\"There are **36 Celestial Immortal Daoists**,\nwith two ranks of **Highest Officials**—\nthe **Heavenly Master** is titled **Supreme Chancellor, Supreme Prime Minister**.\nThere are also the **Three Dukes and Nine Ministers**,\nthe **Six Secretaries**,\nand the **Two Attendants**,\nall mirroring the **official ranks of the mortal Son of Heaven**.*\n\nThe **Later Sage Lord** further declared:\n*\"The **Son of Heaven** of the mortal realm,\nreceiving the **teachings of the Celestial Sage**,\nis named **Son of Heaven**—\nhence, the title **Heavenly Son**.\nHis ministers and officials,\nlike the **Heavenly Sage’s**, share the same ranks and numbers.\"*\n\nLord Lao said:\n*\"The **Celestial Immortal Daoists** use the **Seal of the Jade Sovereign of Upper Purity (上清玉皇)**,\nthen the **Seal of Yuan Shi (元始)**—\nthese are the **commonly employed** ones.\n**Divine Immortal Daoists** use the **Seal of the Celestial Sage of Jade Capital (玉京太上)**,\nalso **six characters**,\nits use aligning with that of **Celestial Immortals**,\nthough the **seal characters differ**.\nNext comes the **Seal of the Flying Celestial Nine Wilds (飞天九野)**.*\n\n**Summoning Daoists**—\nin ancient times called **Summoning Lords**—\ntoday are the **Four Heavenly Lords**.\nThey use the **Seal of the Celestial Sage of Lord Lao (太上老君)**,\na **three-character Seal**,\ngoverning the **Three Primordial Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water**.\nThis Seal is granted to **subdue and capture** unrighteous ghosts,\n**deviant gods**, and **rebellious spirits**—\nthose who refuse submission,\nwho **craft malevolent *qi* to torment mortals**.\nWith this Seal, they **stamp talismans and edicts**,\nand write **imperial commands** to **banish and sever** them.\nIf they still resist,\nthe **Seal is applied and petitioned**,\nor **written and beheaded** in judgment.\n\nNext, they use the **Seal of the Three Heavenly Celestial Sages (三天太上)**,\na **six-character Seal**,\ngoverning the **Six Canons**.\nThis is for **Summoning Daoists**,\nwho have **meritorious deeds** toward **humans, gods, dragons, and ghosts**—\nthey may **employ the Seal to transmit Dharma**,\nusing **Seal-Passes, Seal-Boards, and Seal-Passes of Upper Purity**,\nand **great documents** to **petition the Heavenly Departments**,\nor **use this talisman** in conjunction.\n\nIf they employ **small Summoning documents** or **large talismans and edicts** alone,\nthey use the **Seal of the Celestial Sage (太上)**.\nBeyond these two Seals,\nthere are **additional Seals and Talismans** for distinct purposes.\n\nThese **Seals and Talismans**—\nwhere the **talisman resembles the Seal**—\nare not the **orthodox Dharma Seals**,\nbut named **White Heaven Bestowed Rectangular Talismans**.\n\nFor **mortals**—\nwhether **Summoning Daoists** or **Green-Robed Blue-Robed Daoists**—\nthey may use **small Seal-Characters**,\nor the **Seal of the Duke of Success (遂公)**,\nwhich is a **single-character Seal**.\n\nThe **Two-Character Seal**—\none bearing **sole Seal-Characters**,\none bearing **sole Edict-Characters**—\nis also called the **Seal of the Duke of Success**.\n\nTo **validate the Seal’s efficacy**,\nwalk **three times in the *Yu Step*** (stomping steps),\nor **three strides of the Nine Marks** (散为禹步三步九迹),\n**adjusting the robes** and **turning the Heavenly Lock** (天关)\n—**left hand for men, right for women**.\nHold the Seal while **aligning with the stars**,\nthen **recite the invocation**:\n*'Heaven’s spirit is holy, Earth’s spirit is holy,\nthe **Divine Seal descends**—\na hundred ghosts vanish in form.\nAs the commandments decree, so it shall be done.'*\n\nAfter the Seal is applied,\nthen **seal the Talisman**,\nand **apply the Seal again** upon it.\nThus, the method is performed—\nits efficacy is **great and verified**.\n\nIf practiced for **three to five years**,\none shall **naturally attain communion with the gods**,\nand **forevermore** need not employ **steps, talismanic arrays, or robe adjustments**—\nonly **sitting in meditation**, they **turn the Heavenly Lock**,\nand **apply the Seal** upon **Talismans and Talismanic Documents**.\nThe **Talismans shall naturally take effect**.\n\nThe **worthy** cultivate the Dao,\nfearing **calamities**,\nor to **flee disasters**,\nor to **aid the nation in flood control**—\nthey may **traverse water without drowning**,\nfor **Lord Lao** said:\n*\"In general, to **restrain the Sea God**,\none may **walk upon water without difficulty**,\nas if treading the Earth—\nwater flows at the **command of the heart**.\"*\n\nOn the **sixth day of the wu-stem** (六戊日), one must always **tread the Earth’s Veins** (蹑地纪).\nDoing so repeatedly for **three years** will perfect the **Art of Walking on Water**.\n\nTo **tread the Earth’s Veins three times** is to **dissolve into the Nine Steps of Yu’s Pace** (禹步三步九迹).\nThen, **adjust the robe**, **turn the Heavenly Lock** (天关),\nand **constantly summon the Sea God, River God, and Jiang God**,\nasking them of the **matter of traversing water**,\nand **commanding the waters to flow backward**—\nall **hundred kinds of water arts** must be **enacted by the Sea God**.\n\nLater, when teaching the **Art of Walking on Water**,\nthe **method without difficulty** must be **mastered through the Dao of the Pincers** (镊之道).\nIt shall not exceed **three years** before completion.\n\n**Master Lu** practiced the **method of Treading the Earth’s Veins and Flying the Heavenly Ropes** (飞天纲),\nbut first, he **must learn the essentials of Fire and Water**—\nonly then shall the **Way be perfected**.\n\nOne must **record the sixth day of the wu-stem**,\nand repeatedly perform the rites.\nThe **water spirits shall emerge and submit**,\nand **support the walker upon the waters**.\n\nFor the **sixth day of the wu-stem rites**:\nFirst, on the **wu-yin day of the seasonal month** (季月中戊寅日),\ntake **wu-stem soil** (六戊上土) to form mud,\n**finger-sized and half-inch long**, and let it dry.\nWith **yellow thread**, bind it to the **Sea God’s Mark** (海神理),\nseal it with **yellow honey**, and **stamp with the Great Auspicious Seal** (大吉印),\nusing the **Nine Perfections** (九巳).\n**Eleven breaths of qi** (炁十一) must be **withheld**—\ndo not **scatter the qi**.\n\nThen, **cover with the Heavenly Yang qi** (覆天刚炁) seven times,\nplacing it upon the **Sea God’s Mark** and the **fords to be crossed**—\n**instantly, the crossing shall be achieved**.\n\nThe **Master’s oral transmission** states:\n*\"First, **grasp the Veins** (镊纪),\nand **apply the Form with diligence**—\nthen, the method shall succeed.\nIf the crossing fails, perform it at the moment,\nbut there shall be **no response**.\"*\n\nThe **incantation lies beneath the feet**:\nFor crossing a **river**, use the **River God’s Mark** (河神目);\nfor crossing a **jiang**, use the **Jiang God’s Mark** (江神目).\nEach has its own **Mark**.\n\nAlways take **dried wu-stem soil** and place it upon the **Mark**,\nbinding it with **yellow thread**.\nTo traverse **all rivers and jiaos** (江河),\nit shall be **as walking on land**—\n**no sinking, no drowning**.\nThis method is **wonderfully efficacious**.\n\nLater, the **Sage Emperor** told **Master Zhang Daoling**:\n*\"This method of walking on water,\ncoming and going like upon land—\nyou must **transmit it only to the worthy**.\nTo others, **do not transmit it**,\nfor if you do, **Heaven shall punish**.\nWhen punishment comes, **people shall drown**.\nIf someone else gains this ability,\nwalking upon water like land,\nand **common folk** see them\n**traversing waters in secret**,\nif they do not engage in **theft**,\nbut are **caught and questioned**,\nand **walk away unseen**,\n**Heaven shall punish them with death**.\"*\n\n**Lord Lao** said:\n*\"The **wu-stem soil** is shaped like a **human form**, two and a half inches long,\nmixed with **wood-pulp mud** (木皮和泥).\n**Wood-pulp** refers to **paper**—\nthe **tendon-like substance** (筋) of paper.\nThis is the **sound of ‘tendon’** (筋之义).\nLet them use **mud made from old paper tendons**,\nas previously recorded.\nAlso, on the **wu-stem day**, craft **yellow thread**,\nbind it beneath the feet,\nand **recite the Hexagrams of Six Ren and Six Gui** (六壬、六癸等诀),\nto walk upon water as upon land.\nWherever one **frequently traverses**,\nwith **fords and crossings**,\nthere shall be **no obstruction**.\"*\n\nYet, in this age,\n**many use it with malice and envy**,\nhence, **do not practice it**—\n**beware**.\nFor those who **pursue the Dao**,\nif they **act recklessly**,\nthey shall **suffer this calamity and die** as the extreme.\n\nIn ancient times, **Ge Xuan** often did this,\nand was **suspected by the world**,\ncalled a **Sage**—\nthough he **avoided worldly punishment**,\nhe was **denounced to the Underworld**,\nand **reported to the Jade Emperor of the Highest Sovereign**.\nThe **Highest Sovereign was enraged** and **demoted him two ranks**,\nso that he **only attained the Way of Non-Death**.\nStill, by **imperial decree**,\nhe was **ordered to traverse the Five Peaks on foot**,\n**forbidden to lightly ride tigers and leopards**—\nhow much more so **not to ride clouds, dragons, cranes, or phoenixes to ascend to Heaven**?\nScholars must **know this as the supreme warning**.\n\n---\n**End of Volume Twenty-Six of *The Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl***\n**Beginning of Volume Twenty-Seven of *The Golden Lock and

Sage of the Central Realm**, **Master Zhai Wang**, **Zhang Daoling**, **Zhao Sheng**, **Wang Chang**, **Li Zhongfu**, **Mao Ying**, **Xu Yu Fu**, and others, were posthumously composed by their descendants. **Daoist Master Li Chunfeng** annotated them. The method of **shrinking space to travel far and wide** for those who aspire to the Dao/Way is as follows:\n\n**The Way of Entering the Celestial Abodes** is appended.\n\n**The Highest Sovereign, Laozi**, said:\n*\"To earnestly study the Dao/Way with focused intent,\nand seek the **manifestation of divine powers (shentong)**,\nas the years accumulate, one must have **responses (youying)**.\nAfter attaining **responses (youying)**,\nthis is **divine power (shentong)**.\nFollowing **divine power (shentong)**,\ndo not recklessly employ or speak of it,\nfor the sake of pursuing the **Supreme Dao (zhidao)**.\nIf one can use **compassionate virtue/power (cixin)****\nto rescue and aid living beings,\nthen this is permissible.\nBut do not frivolously display **divine powers (shentong)****\nto show off to the world,\nclaiming them as my own.\nSuch a person is not one who truly aspires to the Dao/Way.\"*\n\nThe method states:\n*\"First, wear the **Earth-Axis Divine Talisman (Dizhou Shenfu)****\non the left side.\nThe **Earth-Axis Talisman (Dizhoufu)***\nis the **Yellow Court General’s Symbol (Huangting Jiangjunfu)***,\nwith three scrolls and twenty-four generals.\nThese generals can **shrink the earth’s pulse (suedimao)***,\ncondensing a thousand *li* into five *li*,\nor even into a space of a hundred paces,\nand a ten-thousand *li* journey into ten *li*,\nor even five paces.\nIn ancient times, **Master Hu Gong** could perform this,\nand **Fei Changfang** encountered it.\nAfter spending one night in Hu’s abode,\nFei’s arrival was delayed by three years.\nThus, he received this talisman,\nand could **shrink the earth’s pulse (suedimao)***,\ntraveling ten thousand *li* in a day—\nno one could catch up to him.\n\nHe only knew of **shrinking the earth’s pulse (suedimao)***,\nbut not that the earth’s pulse also belongs to the **Northern Dipper’s jurisdiction (Beidou suoguan)***.\nWhether one wishes to **shrink or expand it (suediyu)***,\nall is at one’s discretion.\n\n**Fei Changfang** said:\n*\"I can expand a single pace of earth into a thousand *li* of rivers and mountains,\nand condense a thousand *li* of rivers and mountains into a single pace of earth—\nthis is because **divine power (shentong)** is unrestricted.\nAs such, it is worn on the left side,\nand when one treads the **Earth’s Measure (diji)***,\nmoving forward and backward, upside down and right-side up,\nrepeating five times,\nthis is called **completing the Five Phases (Jinmu Shuihuo Tu)***—\nthe **Five Phases (Wuxing)*** of **Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth**.\n\nAgain, one may scatter the steps as the **Yugong’s Steps (Yubu)***,\ntaking three steps with nine traces three times,\nthen transforming into twelve steps twice,\nand again into fifteen steps twice.\nAdjust the clothing,\nturn the **Celestial Pass (Tian Guan)***,\npoint to the earth,\nand pinch the **incantation (zhe)***.\nThe **incantation (zhe)*** is at the base of the right thumb,\ninside the palm is the **Guan (监) Incantation**,\nand below is the **Doushi (都使) Incantation**.\nThen pinch the **Generals of the Earth’s Virtue/Power (Shen) and Earth’s Pulse (Dimao)***—\nthe **Doushi (都使) Generals of the Earth’s Pulse (Dimao)***,\nand the **Doushi (都使) Generals of the Earth’s Core (Dixin)***.\n\nLater, the **Sage of the Later Generation (Hou Shengjun)***\ninstructed the **Heavenly Master (Tianshi)***) thus:\n*\"On days of **Geng-Yin, Xin-Mao, Wu-Chen, Ji-Si***—\nthe **Earth-Pulse (Dimao)*** and **Earth-Core (Dixin)*** incantations—\nthe **Earth’s Core (Dixin)*** lies on the left side,\nopposite the joint of the right thumb,\nand is always marked with **vermilion and ink (zhumofu)***.\nThis is to summon the **Earth’s Spirit (Dishen)***.\nWith the right hand, pinch the **Jue (决) Incantation**,\nand with the left hand, pinch the **Gai (夬) Incantation**.\n\nBefore one’s studies are complete,\nalways remember this:\nseal it with **vermilion and ink (zhumofu)***.\nAfter three years,\nsuddenly apply it on one day,\nand instantly arrive at a place ten thousand *li* distant—\nin another province or district—\nfor this is the **Earth’s Spirit (Dishen)***\nthat moves one there,\nand this often occurs in practice.*\n\n**Laozi** said:\n*\"When **traversing the Dao’s qi (xingjinqi)***,\none **shifts and transforms the celestial lodges (duanjingxingzu)***.\nTo **sever rivers and condense earth (duanjian suedimao)***,\nall are methods that can be passed on\nonly by those with **faith (xin)***—\nnot by others who would recklessly transmit them.\nIf one transmits them and then **recklessly employs (wangyong)***\nthem, yet does not **fully grasp the divine power (shentong)***,\nand moreover, if one’s heart is **unbalanced and unjust (xingcusuo)***,\nof **coarse and evil nature (xingcusuo)***,\nacting in **haste and rashness (jicong)***,\nwith **poisonous intent (xindutuo)***—\nthen such a person must only be told of **the Way of Repentance (gaodao)***,\nand **transmission to this person must be strictly forbidden**.\nFor this is the **supreme method (shangfa)*** of Daoism,\n**shrinking space to travel far and wide (suedihuailai)***—\nlike turning one’s finger to reach the palm.\n\n**The Way of Entering the Celestial Abodes**.\"\n\nThe **Venerable Sage** told the **Great King**:\n\n*\"The masters of the underworld—those **Celestial Immortals** of the **Cavernous Heavens**—possess only the **Way of enduring life and longevity**, known as the **Land of the Deathless**. Their ranks are divided into three titles: the first are called **Celestial Masters of the Cavernous Heavens**, the second **Record-Keepers of Fate**, and the third **Registrars of Deeds**.\n\nIf you wish to enter the Cavern, do so on the **sixth day of the third or ninth lunar month**, tracing the **Earth’s Measure** with **Yu’s Steps**—first stepping upon the **Earth’s Measure**, then performing **Yu’s Steps** three times with nine strides, followed by twelve steps, then fifteen. Upon completion, **adjust your celestial robe**, turn the **Heavenly Bolt**, and with nine movements of your fingers, point toward the **Cavern’s Gate**.\n\nOften, within no more than three or five days, the **Cavern’s Gate** will suddenly open of its own accord. If a **woman** appears, do not follow her inside. Wait until the **Jade Maiden** enters first—then, after she has advanced roughly a hundred paces, you may enter. If a **man** emerges, you may follow him without hesitation.\n\nThe **Celestial Robe**, the **Heavenly Bolt**, and the finger-movements that open the **Cavern’s Gate**—when a person exits directly, another may enter directly in turn. If a **woman** is to enter first, calculate a hundred paces ahead before following behind—this is the **Lair of the Female Immortal**.\n\n**Laozi said:**\n*'To enter the Cavern, let the light of the sun and moon illuminate your path ahead. Invoke the **Wild Boar of Wu**, the **Mandarin Duck**, the **Lion**, the **White Crane**, the **Azure Dragon**, the **White Tiger**, the **Dark Turtle**, and the **Vermilion Bird**. With your **left hand**, pinch the **Cavern’s Gate Incantation**; with your **right hand**, apply **cinnabar and ink** to the **Cavernous Heaven Incantation**.\n\nIn your **left hand**, hold a **small dagger of the Earth’s Core**—this is the **Cavernous Heaven Incantation**. On the **center of your right palm**, near the elbow’s crease, inscribe the character **地 (Earth)**. When complete, this is called the **Cavernous Heaven Incantation**. Three to two months before entering the Cavern, repeatedly apply **cinnabar and ink** to it. Upon reaching the **Cavern’s Gate**, again pinch it with your **right hand**—then it will open of its own accord, and the **Spirit** will emerge to welcome you inside.\n\nOnce you enter the **Cavern’s Gate**, it will open by itself, and the **Spirit** will guide you in.\n\n**The Method of Riding the Dragon, Mounting the Crane, and Traveling by Wind—Entering Heaven, Earth, Water, and Stone.**\n\n**Laozi said:**\n*'The **Immortal Adepts** practice such that they can **summon and tame dragons**, **control and ride cranes**. They ascend to Heaven, descend to Earth, and traverse water and stone.\n\nOn **days of the *Renchen* stem-branch (壬辰)**, trace the **Earth’s Measure** three times, then scatter into **Yu’s Steps**. On **days of the *Guihai* stem-branch (癸亥)**, recite the **Flying Steps** three times and chant the **Dragon-Riding Incantation**—the incantation is embedded within the **Flying Steps**. After three repetitions, scatter into **Yu’s Steps** three times, then **adjust your celestial robe** and turn the **Heavenly Bolt**.\n\nNow, **point to the Eastern Azure Dragon’s ancestor, Lord Meng Zhang**—surname **Meng**, given name **Zhang**. He is the **Azure Dragon General**. Roughly speaking, the **Dragon’s primordial ancestor** bore the surname **Meng**. Later descendants adopted their own branches, aligning with human surnames. Today, there are those surnamed **Cui, Lu, Li, Zheng, Jiang, Tang, Liang, Chang**, and others. In the **Jin Dynasty**, two dragons arrived from the **Khotan Kingdom**, surnamed **Tian** and **Shi**, residing in the **Jiangnan region** and **Mount TianTai**, coming and going as they pleased. These were successive generations of **Dragon descendants**, as previously recorded.\n\nNext, **point to the Southern Vermilion Dragon’s ancestor, Lord Ling Guang**—surname **Ling**, given name **Guangshi**. Roughly speaking, this is the **lineage of the Vermilion Bird General**. Later descendants changed their surnames to **Zhang, Wang, Zhao, Zhang, Yang, Ying**, and others—successive generations of **Vermilion Dragon offspring**.\n\nNext, **point to the Western White Dragon’s ancestor, Lord Jian Bing**—surname **Jian**, given name **Bing**. Roughly speaking, this is the **lineage of the White Tiger General**. Later descendants adopted the surnames **Bai, Xia, Shang, Ren, Wen, Zhen, Chen, Qian, Yuan**, and others—successive generations of **White Dragon offspring**.\n\nNext, **point to the Northern Black Dragon’s ancestor, Lord Zhi Ming**—surname **Zhi**, given name **Ming**. Roughly speaking, this is the **lineage of the Dark Turtle General**. Later descendants changed their surnames to **Liu, Pei, Yuan, Liu, Huangfu, Guan, Ruan, Kong, Shan, Chou**, and others—successive generations of **Black Dragon offspring**.\n\nFinally, **point to the Central Yellow Dragon’s ancestor, Lord Huang Ting**—surname **Huang**, given name **Ting**. Roughly speaking, this is the **lineage of the Yellow Court General**. Later descendants adopted the surnames **Ding, Dai, Lei, Rang, Mei, Zhou, Chi, He, Ge, Luo, He**, and others—successive generations of **Yellow Dragon offspring**.\n\nThese successive **Dragon descendants**, such as those surnamed **Ding, Huang, Chen, Zhao**, and others who come on **direct days (直日)**, will hasten to you. I, as the **Celestial Official**, often enter the **Heavenly Gate**, using you to **ride and guide**. Urgently respond to my summons.\n\n*Think upon Heaven and Earth—let Heaven and Earth brighten for me.\nThink upon the sun and moon—let the sun and moon shine for me.\nThink upon the rivers and seas—let the rivers and seas clear for me.\nAs I roam through Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, the **Spiritual Mountains** and the **River’s banks**, urgently summon the **Sea Dragon**—it must arrive swiftly.\nI traverse the **Eight Extremes**, ascending to the **Supreme Polarity of the Highest Purity**—urgently, as the **Law decrees**.\n\n**The Venerable Sage instructs the Heavenly Master on the Dragon-Riding Incantation:**\n\n*'Whether riding the **Dragon** or mounting the **Phoenix**, all rely on the **Heavenly Ropes of Qi**. Riding the **Wind**, the **Clouds**, the **Smoke**, the **Dust**, the **Mist**, or the **Wild Steed**—all use the **Heavenly Ropes of Qi**.\n\nThe **Yang Ropes** belong to **Heaven’s Court**, also called the **Heavenly Puff Qi**. The method of obtaining them is to know where **Heaven’s One** resides and apply the corresponding technique.\n\nAs in the **Yin-Yang Prohibitions**, there is no greater method than this.\n\nWhen the time comes, face **Heaven’s One**, kneel, close your eyes, and inhale the **Qi of Heaven’s One** through your nose. Let it transform into a **purple cloud** enveloping your body—twenty-four breaths suffice.\n\nThen, seek the **Heavenly Puff Qi** nine times as the **Guide**, and again five times as the **Heavenly Ropes Qi**.\n\nWhen moving, lie upon the **Dragon Cloud**, searching as you rise. Pinch your **left hand’s fourth finger at the second joint**, clench your teeth twenty-four times to unblock them, then **stabilize your gaze**, close your **Qi**, and let the method manifest at will.\n\nThis technique binds the **Spirit’s Core** with a **thread**, encircling the **Divine Pupil**, then seals it with the **Temporal Divine Seal**—the **Seal of the Temporal Deity**.\n\nThe **Temporal Deities** correspond to:\n- **January**: **Engaging Brightness (登明)**\n- **February**: **River Chief (河魁)**\n- **March**: **Following the Chief (从魁)**\n- **April**: **Transmission (传送)**\n- **May**: **Lesser Auspiciousness (小吉)**\n- **June**: **Victory Beforehand (胜先)**\n- **July**: **Supreme Unity (太乙)**\n- **August**: **Heavenly Ropes (天纲)**\n- **September**: **Supreme Rush (太冲)**\n- **October**: **Functionary (功曹)**\n- **November**: **Great Auspiciousness (大吉)**\n- **December**: **Divine Sovereign (神后)**\n\nThe practitioner must stand ready according to these distinctions.\n\n**Riding the Dragon or Mounting the Phoenix** depends on the **Dragon-Phoenix principles beneath your feet as the method.\"*\n\n「The male practitioner rides the **Dragon**, the female mounts the **Phoenix**—these are the **Temporal Deities**.\n\nIn ancient times, **Liezi** practiced the **Dragon-riding method**, thus prohibiting this technique. The female practitioner mounts the **white goose**, and **Nüwa** mounts the **crane**; all are variations of this **Phoenix-riding** prohibition.\n\nIf one desires to ride the **Dragon**, they must first take the **Tianyi qi (天一炁)** nine times to cover oneself. Then, they take the **Tianxiang qi (天罡炁)** and the **Baihu qi (白虎炁)**, each eleven times, and also strike the teeth as prescribed. The practitioner then kneads the **Du (都)** point, takes a piece of iron from the **six Gēng (庚)** days, about the size of a little finger and one inch and four tenths in length, and hides it above the **Dragon-riding principle** beneath their feet. A white thread is used as a cord to bind it forty-nine times, sealing it with **white honey (白蜜)** and marking it with the **Baihu Seal (白虎印)** and the **From the Chief Seal (从魁印)**. The **Qinglong (青龙, Azure Dragon)** then manifests, and the practitioner may ride at will.\n\nUpon completion, the seal and binding are removed. The practitioner kneads the second joint of the right thumb, exhales seven times, and the **Dragon departs**. All worldly practitioners must be cautious in this matter.\n\nThe prohibition of **Dragon-Phoenix riding** extends to **clouds, winds, mists, and dusts**—only those who seek **Daoist transcendence (求仙)** and are of the **absolute generation (绝代)** may achieve this. Otherwise, one must first observe strict **fasting (清斋)** and live in seclusion among the mountains, lest harm befall them by summoning these forces. Be cautious.\n\nThe methods for **Phoenix-riding** and **Dragon-riding** are fundamentally the same. Only the **Five Officials (五官)** of the **Temporal Deities (日神)** differ, along with the **hidden scriptures (隐文)** and **distinctive ear points (别耳)**.\n\n**Laojun (老君)** said: The **Phoenix-riding method** is also similar, but the **Dragon-riding incantation (勑咒)** merely changes the phrase to **\"eastern Azure Phoenix (青凤)\"**. The **Five Directions’ incantations (五方勑请)** are analogous to the **Dragon-riding method**, with slight variations.\n\nIn the **Phoenix-riding incantation**, the **Phoenix principle** beneath the left foot is invoked, as depicted in the diagram: *\"The Phoenix-riding incantation is this.\"* The **Dragon-riding incantation** pertains to the **Dragon principle** beneath the right foot, as shown in the diagram: *\"The Dragon-riding incantation and its principle are already mentioned above, and both are included in the Palm Diagram (掌图).\"* One may simply use a **small Dragon-Phoenix (小龙凤)** carved from **tung wood (桐木)**, painted with the five colors, and fastened to the corresponding **principle points (本文理)** beneath the feet. Five-colored threads are also used.\n\nThe **Lady of Qin (秦女)**, **Nongyu (弄玉)**, rode the **Luanfeng (鸾凤, mandarin duck and phoenix)** and traveled the **Eight Directions (八方)**, having learned these teachings from **Xiaozi (萧子)**.\n\nUpon completion, she **stepped the Ji (纪) three times**, performed the **Yǔbù (禹步)** nine times, **aligned her attire (配衣)**, turned the **Tiānguān (天关)**, and pointed toward the **eastern Azure Phoenix (青凤)** in the sky, summoning it to control and guide her. She then rode it, circling the heavens and traversing the **Eight Directions** without wearying in the **Daoist palaces (仙府)**.\n\nRegarding the method of **drawing circles on the ground to form rivers or mountains**:\n\n**Laojun (老君)** said: *\"When a practitioner of the Dao (志人修道) achieves the Dao (道成), they may move among mortals (因行人间). If they encounter malicious individuals (遇恶人) who pursue them, or thieves (贼) who wish to steal Daoist scriptures (仙经), talismans (符法), secret incantations (秘诀), or spiritual medicines (灵药), and are seen within ten or fifteen li (里), they may avoid danger by stepping into the path’s edge, stepping the Ji (纪) three times, then dispersing into the Yǔbù (禹步)—three steps, nine strides. Upon completion, they align their attire (配衣), turn the Tiānguān (天关), and point inward, transforming the ground into a river or sea (化地为江海), which the pursuers cannot cross. The practitioner then retreats and hides themselves; after the pursuers disperse, they return to the ground, which has reverted to its normal state, and alter the perception of the thieves’ eyes. In ancient times, many Daoists employed this method. If someone forcibly crosses, they will drown and die. This is because their **direct Tianqi (直炁)** movement clashes with the **Tianqi’s command to disrupt (炁干冲始要令)**—it appears as if they drowned.\n\nIf the pursuer is killed, it is by the **Northern Dipper’s martial forces (北斗中兵)**.\n\nThe **incantation of severing the pursuer’s blade (捻人刀支诀)** follows the **Five Phases (金木水火土)** incantations. Those from the **eastern direction (东方)** have names associated with **wood (木)**, those from the **southern direction (南方)** follow the **fire (火) incantation**, and the **Five Emperors (五帝)** are invoked for correspondence.\n\n**Laojun (老君)** said: *\"If a practitioner is maliciously pursued or captured by evil individuals, they must not rashly engage in killing. Instead, they should remain as before, stepping the Ji (纪) and Yǔbù (禹步), aligning their attire (配衣), turning the Tiānguān (天关), and pointing toward the grass and trees, forming a continuous mountain range (指草林木为山山相连接). They then enter this mountain and hide themselves. Once the pursuers disperse, they emerge from the mountain, which then reverts to its original state—no longer a mountain. The pursuers will be baffled by this inexplicable transformation, searching for the mountain’s location their entire lives without finding it, and eventually abandoning the pursuit.\n\nRegarding the method of **transforming vessels into the Six Jia (六甲) and Seven Stars (七星), and appearing or disappearing in the Tianying (天营, Heavenly Encampment)**:\n\n**Taishang Laojun (太上老君)**—*\"Taishang (太上)\" refers to Laojun (老君).*\"\n\nThis is the **Taishang Laojun’s** lineage, thus the later sages of the Dao/Way reverently honor him as **Taishang Laojun**. He said: *\"Today’s people do not know this. They merely use the name Laojun, without removing the Taishang prefix, which is incorrect.\"*\n\nAs for those who cultivate the **Six Jia (六甲)**, upon completion of the second level, they attain the rank of **intermediate cultivators**. Those of the highest level, however, are **Taishang Laojun himself**, who personally wears the **Six Jia talisman**. Another highest level is the **Lingfei Six Jia talisman (灵飞六甲符)**.\n\nWhen practicing the **Ji (纪) and Yǔbù (禹步)**, upon completion of the third level, one must further receive the **San Yuan (三元) and Wu De (五德)**. **San Yuan** refers to the **San Yuan fa lu (三元法箓)**. **Wu De** refers to the **Five Deities’ talismans**: Green Dragon (青龙), White Tiger (白虎), Vermilion Bird (朱雀), Dark Tortoise (玄武), and Yellow Court (黄庭).\n\nThose who have ascended through the **Thirty-Six Stages (三十六阶)** of Dao/Way cultivation and study this method must first receive the talismans to attain full qualifications. Only then can they **communicate with the spirits**, and through this, they can point to small vessels, causing them to contain the **Heaven and Earth**.\n\nThe marvelous and divine efficacy of this method is beyond measure. In ancient times, **Master Fu Gong (壶公)** taught **Fei Changfang (费长房)** this practice. The talismans, once fully received, naturally enable spiritual communication and unpredictable transformations—one can alter a vessel no larger than a **sheng (一升)**, making it vast enough to contain the **Heaven and Earth**, just as the original creation of the cosmos unfolded.\n\nOne can also obtain the **Spring Regengzi (春庚子)** and cultivate the **Xianhu (仙壶, Immortal Vessel)**. The **Xianhu** resembles a small **gengzi (罂子)**, capable of holding **one and a half sheng (一升半)**. With careful cultivation, one takes the **Regengzi day (庚子日)**—such as the **Regengzi day in the second month**—to sow the vessel in the **east-southeast (东南)** direction of one’s residence. If a woman plants it, she must not allow a man to see afterward; if a man plants it, a woman must not see afterward.\n\nBy the **eighth month**, when the vessel is ready for harvest, leave **three to five seeds** for ripening. The scriptures state: *\"One seed left yields two; the three upper seeds are the middle. Only the middle and upper seeds are kept, while the lower ones are discarded, lest they be insufficient. Hence, more are not left.\"* Take two vessels with the **best, firmest color** and first fill them with **five catties of cinnabar (朱砂)**, though some say **six catties is the correct method**. Leave them for **sixty days**.\n\nNext, add **one to two catties of male verdigris (曾青)** into the cinnabar, leaving it for **sixty days**. Then, add **sixty days’ worth of realgar (雄黄)**. Next, introduce **two catties of female verdigris (雌黄)** and **two catties of silver mud (银泥)** into each vessel, leaving them for **sixty days** each. Following that, add **two catties of gold mud (金泥)** and **one catty of barberry wax (胡燕脂)**, each for **sixty days**.\n\nHaving inserted all **eight substances** into the vessels, each left for **sixty days**, the total duration sums to **six times eight—four hundred and eighty days**. Once this period is complete, take the vessel filled with cinnabar first and recite the **Six Jia talisman of the second level (二等符)** **four hundred times**, inserting it into one vessel.\n\nHang both vessels on the **east-southeast pillar (东南柱)** of the **Jingzhong (靖中)**, using **wooden blocks of Chinese catalpa (梓木)** to insulate them from the **earthly qi (地炁)**, preventing any disruption that might harm the vessel’s potency.\n\nOn a **Jiāzǐ day (甲子日)**, begin the **Ji (纪) and Yǔbù (禹步)**. **Ji (步)** is the **Heavenly Constraint (天纲)**, **Yǔbù (蹑)** is the **Earthly Restraint (地纪)**—thus called **Ji and Yǔbù**. Perform each **three times**. Afterward, recite the **incantations for Heavenly Constraint (天纲)** and **Earthly Restraint (地纪)** in sequence: **eighteen incantations for Earthly Restraint (地纪)**, and **twenty-nine for Heavenly Constraint (天纲)**.\n\nOnce the incantations are complete, **dissolve the form** and perform the **Yǔbù (禹步)** three times—**nine steps each time**, totaling **fifteen steps**. Then, **align attire (配衣)**, **turn the Tiānguān (天关)**, and **point toward the two vessels (指二壶)**, nine times each vessel.\n\nAfterward, recite the invocation: *\"I wish to ascend as an Immortal, transforming you to contain the Heaven. I wish to establish governance, using you to contain the Earth. Left Camp and Right Camp, Six Jia and Seven Stars. The Left Camp controls talismans, the Right Camp commands forces. When talismans and forces converge, I receive the qi of the Six Jia and Beidou (北斗). After a thousand days, it will be spiritually efficacious.\"*\n\nThe Master of the Pot, **Húgōng**, once taught his oral precepts to **Chángfáng**. *\"Fulfillment*—this is how we summon the divine and make it manifest. The divine transformations are boundless; they uphold me as I ascend to the Celestial Court. **Swiftly, swiftly, as the decree commands.** But only on days of the **Jia** stem, perform this—five years hence, the divine efficacy will be great, and you shall attain Immortality.\n\nThis is the **Tàishàng** receiving **Húgōng’s** oral precepts, which **Chángfáng** obtained and now transmits orally to me.\n\nThe **Lǎojūn** said: *\"He who practices the Dao must first cultivate within the heart. If a person’s heart is sincere and can contain Heaven and Earth, then practicing this method will succeed. But if the heart is unbalanced, partial, crooked, or envious—if one learns these arts only to harm others or deceive them, abandoning the straight path—then though one dwells between Heaven and Earth, one will be slain by ghosts and spirits and will not die a natural death. How much less can one, with petty tools, transform into the **Dàluó** Heaven and Earth, unless one’s heart is utterly true, one’s spirit aligned with the sacred transformations, and one’s power in harmony with the **Ming**? Much less can one execute it with true efficacy.\n\nIf you encounter one who has received this, treat their heart as a treasure, for the method will not betray you.\n\nThe **Tiānshī**, after receiving the **Hòushèngjūn’s** command from the **Beidou**’s Nine True Ones, obtained **twenty-four true laws**. These command the **Beidou**’s lords, the **Dòushén**, the **Furen**, the **Jiaonǚ**, and the **Dùbing Dùguān Fùcáo Shǐzhě**—all to be driven and transformed according to these laws. They suppress, rescue, and deliver from calamities, reverse death, traverse fire and water, command armies, and vanish in plain sight—none shall fail.\n\nObtaining this gate and using it is as swift as water and fire. The **eleventh law** is found in the **Beidou**’s **ninth upper and lower scrolls**; the **thirteenth law** is in the **twenty volumes** below the **Bázhái** section. What they govern is also spoken of extensively within the **Beidou**.\n\nThe **Beidou** are Heaven’s messengers, the bridge and crossing of the Great Dao, the path of the law-gate. Both Heaven and humankind must rely on the **Beidou’s** methods for restraint—this is their authority.\n\nThe **Tàishàng Lǎojūn** said: *\"Between Heaven and Earth, there are five **Dòu** True Ones. The **Zhōngdòu** is the chief—what mortals now call the **Beidou**. The **Zhōngdòu** is the sovereign, with the **Dìzūn** and **Yùdì** stars as his attendants. The **Beidou** is the minister, with seven consorts and favored daughters. According to mortal accounts, this too has its basis. Though the ancients called the **Zhōngdòu** the **Beidou**, no sage has yet clarified their distinction. Now, consulting the *Celestial Astronomy Diagram*, one may suspect there is another.\n\nAccording to the *Tiānshī Zhuan*, the **Hòushèngjūn** revealed the names and titles of the five **Dòu** lords and spoke of the **Dìzūn** and **Yùdì** stars in the two **Dòu**. The *Liúzhū Jīng* also states this. Thus, it is known that the **Feibù** (flying steps) belong to the **Zhōngdòu**, while the consorts and favored daughters belong to the **Beidou**. Such celestial deities hold high rank, great virtue, and heavy responsibilities, with wives and children, overseeing inspections and wielding dual authority.\n\nThe **Hòushèngjūn** also entrusted the **Tiānshī** with the *Jīnsùo Liúzhū*, a secret not to be divulged. The sacred words were not lightly bestowed upon mortals, and common folk had no means to recognize them—hence the single name by which they are called.\n\nThose of pure resolve who seek the Dao must follow this guidance to attain it—with proof and verification. When the law is applied, ghosts and spirits tremble in reverence and submit to command.\n\nNow, regarding the **Twenty-Eight Constellations**, the **Twenty-Eight Constellations’ True Guidance**—though the *Liúzhū* has already explained them, some methods are omitted and cannot be used. If they are present, they are not spoken of. Beginning from the east and turning rightward, they conclude at the **Northern Dipper’s Central Enclosure**—this too is unsaid.\n\nThose of resolve who seek the **Ultimate Dao** must always practice the **unsaid teaching**. Internally, they refine their bodies; externally, they rescue their families and others. The man of resolve, having obtained this book and its laws—the *Liúzhū*—must always follow the unsaid teaching. Internally, he depends on the law to refine his body, so that the **inner true self** is moved, the law’s efficacy is realized, and his spirit is tempered. Externally, he rescues his family and others, never practicing the external laws of **ritual speech, perception, or form**, which cause beings to cycle through the bonds of birth and death, the affections of life and death, and the hierarchies of nobility and lowliness—all of which are not the straight path.\n\nThe man of resolve must know this deeply: follow the Dao’s scriptures and practice the unsaid teaching, dwelling in **wuwei**, gradually awakening, and diligently refining himself, ascending in broad daylight.\n\nThe **Lǎojūn** said: *\"The **Dōngdòu** Lord is a man of **Wú**, surnamed **Qín**, named **Chú**, with the style **Gànfàn**. Before the **Zhōu**, he attained the Dao and was ennobled as the **Shùdòu** Lord, overseeing the seven great officials of the **East** and the **ten thousand symbols** of the **East Wilds**, as well as the seven great **hosts** of the **East**—**Jiǎo, Hèng**, and the rest. If those born under these seven hosts suffer calamities or are afflicted by malevolent stars, follow the **Liúzhū’s** spoken incantations and methods, perform the rites, and conclude by **treading the Earthly Restraint** three times, dissolving into the **Yǔbù**, turning the **Tiānguān**, and pointing **eighteen times** toward the east. Pinch the **Sìmìng** and **Dōngdòu** incantations with the left thumb’s root, reciting them swiftly. Then chant the **eighteen incantations**—the **Earthly Restraint’s eighteen incantations**—seven times. Seven times. Thus, calamities are dispelled, misfortunes averted, and sicknesses healed. This is for self-practice.\n\nThe **Tiānshī** said: If one practices this constantly for **twenty-four years**, they shall become an Immortal. If one does it for a friend or kinsman in distress, it shall also succeed. The method is performed as one’s own; only the names differ.\n\nThe **Tiānshī** said: For the **Nán**, **Xī**, and **Běi Dòu**, follow the **Dōngdòu’s** method in steps, incantations, and execution. Only their lords’ names and surnames differ, as listed in the subsequent incantations.\"*\n\nThere is but one incantation, the **Step of the Halter and the Invocation of the Star**. When supplicating, let the words be composed spontaneously at the moment, and when uttering them aloud, rely on the **Twenty-Eight Constellations and their Named Stars**, all of which are detailed in the *Liuzhu Zhengjing*.\n\nUse them according to one’s intent, and success shall follow. Next, the methods for the **Nán Dòu** and its **seven hosts**:\n\nThe **Lǎojūn** said: The **Nán Dòu** lord is surnamed **Táng**, named **Lù**, with the appellation **Xuāndào**. He hails from **Tàiyuán**.\n\nNext, the methods for the **Xī Dòu** and its **seven hosts**:\n\nThe **Xī Dòu** lord is surnamed **Liú**, named **Qǐ**, with the appellation **Shíyīng**. He is from **Cháng’ān**.\n\nNext, the methods for the **Běi Dòu** and its **seven hosts**:\n\nThe **Běi Dòu** lord is surnamed **Chén**, named **Fèng**, with the appellation **Bǎiwàn**, a native of **Jiāngxià**. And so forth, as recorded in the *Liuzhu*.\n\nThe four **Dòu** lords and their **twenty-eight Star Officers** are all assigned to the practitioner’s service, and their supplications are likewise performed in accordance with the **heart-hand resonance**. Do not perform them recklessly without cause—otherwise, it will invite retribution and harm oneself.\n\nNext, the methods for the **Sīmìng** (lords of fate):\n\nThe **Lǎojūn** said: The **left Sīmìng** is one person, surnamed **Hán**, named **Sī**, with the appellation **Yuánxìn**. He is from **Chángluò**.\n\nThe **Sīlù** (recorder), **Sīfá** (punisher), and **Zǔmìng** (assistant to fate) have **thirty-six major officers** in attendance. The **right Sīmìng** is surnamed **Zhāng**, named **Huòyì**, with the appellation **Zǐliáng**, a native of **Guǎngyáng**. The **Sīlù** and others also have **thirty-six major officers** in attendance.\n\nThe **Tiānshī** said: The **Hán** and **Zhāng** **Sīmìng** are both ministers of **Emperor Gāo** of the **Hàn dynasty**. The **Lǎojūn** said: Upon obtaining the names of the **left and right Sīmìng**, one may perform the **six Jia days**, follow the **Earthly Restraint**, and recite the incantations as in the previous **Twenty-Eight Constellations** method. Only the incantations vary according to fate, being assigned as the **Sīmìng incantations**. Pinch them accordingly. If practiced diligently, in **two years**, one shall attain **long life**, and emerge with the secret methods of dispelling calamities and averting misfortunes. With prolonged and earnest cultivation, one shall ascend in broad daylight.\n\n*(End of the **Jīnsuǒ Liuzhu** incantations, as recorded in the **Liuzhu Zhengjing**, Volume 27)*\n*(End of the **Jīnsuǒ Liuzhu** incantations, as recorded in the **Liuzhu Zhengjing**, Volume 28)*\n\nThe **Zhōnghuá Zǒngzhēn Dàxiānzǎi Wáng**—**Fāng Píng**, **Zhāng Dàolíng**, **Zhào Shēng**, **Wáng Cháng**, **Lǐ Zhòngfǔ**, **Máo Yíng**, **Xǔ Yùfǔ**, and others—**are the successive compilers** of this text. The **Daoist Immortal Lǐ Chúnfēng** annotated it, and the **Lawmaster of Consideration** expounded the **Method of Inspection and Circulation** (*Xūnyóu Túfǎ*). The **Tàishàng Lǎojūn** instructed the **Wújí Zhēnréng**—**Dìngguāng**—saying:\n\n*\"Surname Zhēn, given name Dìngguāng. According to the* **Gě Xuān Zhuàn** *it states: There were three* **Zhēnréng** *(True Immortals), who descended to bestow the* **Xuānjīng** *(Mysterious Classics). I do not know if this is the* **Zhēnréng Dìngguāng** *(True Immortal Dìngguāng). Perhaps he shares the same name but does not bear the surname* **Zhēn** *due to confusion. Dìngguāng attained the Dao in the* **Liù Guó** *(Six Kingdoms) era and was a* **Qín** *(Qin) man. He ascended by* **bùjí** *(measured steps), becoming the left* **Wújí Zhēnréng** *(True Immortal of the Limitless).*\n\n*To practice the* **bùjí** *(measured steps) Dao, one must first employ the* **Kǎozhào** *(Inspection and Circulation) method, benefiting all beings and establishing merit in the world of sentient beings—this is called* **xiūqiú** *(cultivation and seeking). It is the conduct of the* **Zhēnréng** *(True Immortals).*\n\n*The* **Kǎozhào** *(Inspection and Circulation) method of the Lawmasters requires first the preservation of the* **Wǔdé** *(Five Virtues/Powers):* **Qīnglóng** *(Azure Dragon), Bái Hǔ** *(White Tiger), Zhū Què** *(Vermilion Bird), Xuánwǔ** *(Dark Tortoise), and Huángtíng** *(Yellow Court)—these are the* **Wǔdé Jiāngjūn** *(Five Virtues/Power Generals).*\n*In ancient times, when the* **Lǎojūn** *(Laozi) promulgated this method, there were first the* **Sānyuán** *(Three Primordials), followed by the* **Wǔdé** *(Five Virtues/Powers).*\n*Now, according to the* **Jīnluó Liúzhū Tú** *(Golden Talisman Flowing Pearl Diagram), the* **Wǔdé Jiāngjūn** *(Five Virtues/Power Generals) are depicted, yet the* **Sānyuán** *(Three Primordials) are absent. Perhaps the* **Sānyuán Jiāngjūn** *(Three Primordial Generals) were separately illustrated in three graded diagrams:* **Hán Hóng Tú** *(Primordial Diagram of the Upper Primordial), Zhōngyuán Tú** *(Diagram of the Middle Primordial), and Xiàyuán Tú** *(Diagram of the Lower Primordial). Their use is unified in the* **Hán Hóng Tú** *(Primordial Diagram of the Upper Primordial).*\n*The* **Sānyuán** *(Three Primordials) are further accompanied by the* **Liù Jiǎ** *(Six Jia Days):* **Liù Dīng Liù Jiǎ** *(Six Ding and Six Jia), the* **Yùnǚ Zhēn Guān** *(Jade Maidens and True Officials).*\n*The* **Liùjì Shí'èr Shén Guān** *(Six Restraints and Twelve Divine Officials), along with the* **Liù Róng Bā Mán** *(Six Rong and Eight Man tribes), must all be preserved as per the scriptures, ensuring their proper deployment.*\n\n*When descending into the mortal realm, they suppress the malevolent, obstinate, and rebellious* **yāojīng** *(demonic spirits), preventing harm to all beings. They are summoned according to the prescribed methods. If they refuse to comply, they are bound by incantations as per the law. If they still do not submit, they are* **bùdòu** *(confronted in battle),*\n*—that is, the* **jì Dìjì** *(Earthly Restraint) method, which follows later—*\n*and then they are decapitated. Upon completion, a proclamation is issued to the ancestral shrines to forbid such spirits for a set number of years, determined by the Lawmaster’s household according to the month, day, and hour. A talisman is then given to that person, corresponding to the specified term.*\n\n*To perform the* **bùdòu** *(battle method), one must first practice* **jì Dìjì** *(Earthly Restraint) three times in a purified chamber, dispersing into* **Yǔbù** *(Yu’s Steps)—fifteen steps in total—while wearing the prescribed attire. One then points to the location of the afflicted person’s household, or to the site for exorcism, as per the diagram. Lǐ Chúnfēng** *(Li Chunfeng) said: The immortals always preserve this diagram for use in ascending to the* **Zhēn Cháo** *(True Court) or exorcising a dwelling. It must be kept and applied as needed. One must always consider the original master first, then oneself following the master, never placing oneself before the master.*\n\n*The* **Hòushèng Jūn** *(Later Sage-King) said: Those who earnestly seek the Dao must preserve this diagram every ten days. While traversing the world and its lands, they lead the generals and soldiers, advancing tens of miles beyond—akin to a great general deploying troops and forming battle arrays. They also preserve the* **Shèyù Qiánjūn** *(vanguard troops),*\n*—the* **vanguard* **being the* **Hányuán Jiāngjūn** *(Upper Primordial General)* **Táng** *(Tang), the* **Zhōngyuán Jiāngjūn** *(Middle Primordial General)* **Gě** *(Ge)—marching left and right—while the* **Zhū Què Jiāngjūn** *(Vermilion Bird General) stands in the center, guiding the way as per the law. They brandish red halberds, banners, and flags, encircling the* **Zhōu Jiāngjūn** *(Zhou General) and the* **Wǔdé Jiāngjūn** *(Five Virtues/Power Generals) in multiple layers, uniting with the* **Xuánwǔ Liùjì Jiāngjūn** *(Dark Tortoise Six Restraint Generals) to form several battle formations. These fly through the sky, their banners and flags resplendent, covering heaven and earth, unstoppable by any foe. The original master also leads at the forefront.*\n*They charge and annihilate the malevolent, obstinate, and demonic spirits.*\n*Returning to formation, they shield the* **Zhèngzhēn Zhī Qì** *(True Qi of the Supreme Truth) and the body of the practitioner. They also rescue those who have yet to awaken from calamities and disasters, aiding the nation in stability, delivering those in peril, and dispersing warring armies when they clash. The practitioner’s prolonged sojourn in the world is a means of accumulating* **yīn gōng** *(merit in the unseen), and when this merit is complete, they ascend as an immortal.*\n\n*This method is supremely efficacious, yet it must be kept secret and not recklessly transmitted to unworthy individuals.*\n\n*The* **Lǎojūn** *(Laozi) said: The* **Jīnluó Tú** *(Golden Talisman Diagram) contains only the* **Wǔdé Jiāngjūn** *(Five Virtues/Power Generals), omitting the* **Sānyuán** *(Three Primordials). This is because the* **Wǔxíng** *(Five Phases) are deployed externally to rescue beings, while the* **Sānyuán** *(Three Primordials) internally guard the practitioner. The* **Sānyuán** *(Three Primordials) are stationed within, and the* **Liùjì** *(Six Restraints) and their retinues are bound within them to protect the practitioner’s body from malevolent ghosts.*\n\n*The* **Tiānshì** *(Celestial Master) transmitted this to the* **Hòushèng Jūn** *(Later Sage-King), whose Daoist merit and power were slight, insufficient to rescue others. Thus, he could only guard himself, and the* **Sānyuán** *(Three Primordials) were preserved internally through their upper, middle, and lower diagrams, found in the* **Hán Hóng Zhèngyī** *(Supreme Primordial of the Upper Primordial). The upper diagram is in* **Hán Hóng** *(Primordial Encompassing), while the middle and lower diagrams are in separate* **Zhèngyī** *(Supreme Primordial) diagrams. The* **Wǔxíng** *(Five Phases) rescue beings, the* **Sānyuán** *(Three Primordials) shield the practitioner, and the* **Liù Jiǎ** *(Six Jia Days) capture ghosts—*\n*—the* **Liù Jiǎ** *(Six Jia Days) are the direct* **Fú Mǎ** *(talismanic soldiers), following the sun and moon, and aiding in the pursuit and capture of evil ghosts.*\n*The* **Qīdòu** *(Seven Battles) invoke the gods. All gods are the* **Běidǒu Shī** *(ministers of the Northern Dipper), who arrive swiftly upon being summoned. This is the* **Tiānshì** *(Celestial Master), the* **Běidǒu** *(Northern Dipper) itself. Yet, within a single day and night—one cycle of heaven—they inspect and patrol all the myriad gods of the earth, aligning with the* **Liù Jiǎ** *(Six Jia Days) in their cosmic harmony.*\n\n*In the* **Jīnluó Tú** *(Golden Talisman Diagram), the* **Yùnǚ Guìfēi** *(Jade Maidens and Noble Consorts) are depicted first, leading and guiding the* **Kǎozhào Fǎshī** *(Lawmasters of Inspection and Circulation).*\n*The* **Liù Jiǎ** *(Six Jia Days) include the* **Liù Yùnǚ** *(Six Jade Maidens), and the* **Běidǒu** *(Northern Dipper) has* **Qī Guìfēi** *(Seven Noble Consorts), all of whom are celestial maidens. Since ancient times, the* **Jīnluó Tú** *(Golden Talisman Diagram) has recorded this, and now it is the* **upper section of the* **Jīnsuǒ Liúzhū** *(Golden Lock Flowing Pearl) text.* *The* **Yùnǚ Guìfēi** *(Jade Maidens and Noble Consorts) are shown first, leading the Lawmaster at the forefront. This is to honor the Lawmaster in accordance with ancient practice.*\n\n*This* **Xūnyóu Túzhèn** *(Inspection and Circulation Diagram Formation) is not singular in purpose but encompasses myriad applications. It may be used by kings, emperors, and nobles to heal illnesses, or to rescue beings from disasters and calamities. It may also be employed to deliver soldiers from peril, or when a practitioner encounters bandits, ferocious beasts, or is separated by water and fire. Or when there are epidemics and contagious diseases, or when malevolent humans and ghosts conspire to harm within a dwelling. Or when the children of* **Dàoshì** *(Daoists) and* **Shìjiè** *(Buddhists) clash in their methods, causing confusion and discord. Or when curses, sacrifices, and rituals contradict one another, leading the practitioner’s heart astray and their intentions awry. Or when officials falsely claim power to harm others, or when they fabricate petitions and memorials, falsely invoking ghosts and gods, recklessly submitting them—such calamities and misfortunes, all may be resolved by this* **Xūnyóu** *(Inspection and Circulation) method, bringing justice to all beings.\"*\n\n「First, one must inspect and circulate for one’s own family, then proceed to others. This method is supremely subtle and wondrous; it must not be recklessly practiced or transmitted—be cautious.\n\n*Lǎojūn* (Laozi/Old Master) says: \"For those who wish to resolve the myriad prior calamities, they must first cultivate *Xūnyóu* (Inspection and Circulation) daily, storing one *qi* (存一, *cún-yī*) to perambulate that household. Thus, all toxins dissolve, all gods and spirits perish, and misfortunes are dispelled.\n\nWhen first embarking upon the perambulation, one should first enter a pure chamber and tread *Yǔbù* (the Earth Step, *Yúbù*) three times, then scatter into *Gǔbù* (Turtle Steps, *禹步*). Three steps make nine traces, exhaling *qi* as a purple cloud, first covering one’s own body.\n\nOnce done, proceed to that household, covering the surrounding houses and the person’s body entirely. Whether in battlefields or myriad afflictions, all shall respond instantly and be resolved.\n\nFor all things respond to completion. Then, pinch the *zuǒ dūjiān* (Left Marshal, 左都監) and *yòu dūjiān* (Right Marshal, 右都監), followed by the *Yóushī jué* (Perambulation Master’s Secret, 游師訣) and the *Sānshī jué* (Three Masters’ Secret, 三師訣).\n\nAfterward, don the ceremonial attire—*Qíqǔn* (Seven Battles, 七斗成)—where the seven stars and seven battles are all present upon the body. Grasping the *Zhìxīng* (Executive Star, 魒星), point to it three times, then recite the five verses of the *Dìjì zhòu* (Earth Step Sutra/Chant, 地紀咒).\n\nThe *Hòushèng* (Later Saints) taught the *Tiānshī* (Celestial Master’s) oral secrets: for great matters, always recite the *Dìjì zhòu* (Earth Step Sutra) in its entirety of nineteen verses, which is the highest. Nothing shall fail to respond as desired.\n\nPointing three times, all matters dissolve and perish instantly. Thus, one’s endeavors shall succeed, and all harm shall vanish, neither affecting oneself nor others.\n\nThe chant reads:\n*\"Tàishàng chuánjiào, hòushèng liúxíng.*\n*Tiānshī qīnshòu, jiǔqiān wànbīng.*\n*Xúnchá shífāng, shìqì sānqīng.*\n*Shén wú xiōngdǎng, guǐ wú yāojīng.*\n*Rén guǐ gèjū, bùdé yǒu zhēng.*\n*Xínghuò zhě sǐ, xíngfú zhě shēng.*\n*Huòfú wú zhī, suíshǒu fēnmíng.*\n*Zuǒ zhǐ sānmiè, yòu zhǐ sìqīng.*\n*Wù fàn wú dào, wú dào shèn píng.*\n*Yǒuzuì wúshè, wúzuì zìníng.*\n*Tiān cì wú fǎ, lìng wú ànxíng.*\n*Mò fàn wú wēi, wēi měng qīxīng.*\n*Yǐn rǔ xuè, shí rǔ jīng.*\n*Yīqiè dàn píngděng, wú dào bù lìng xíng.*\n*Yīqiè xīn dúpài, wú dào lìng zhǎnxíng.*\n*Jíjí rúlìng shìng.*\n\nUpon completing the chant, one must then visualize the diagram as instructed. The diagrams are of three ranks, as follows:\n\nThe first rank is the diagram of *Gǔbù* (Turtle Steps) and *Qǔndǎ* (Fist Battles, 拳打) from the *Liúzhū* (Falling Pearls, 流珠) upper volume, specifically the third step of the *Jīng* (Scripture, 纲) and the ceremonial attire for the *Qǔndǎ* (Fist Battles).\n\nThe second rank includes the diagrams of the *Sānyuán Sānwǔ* (Three Five Three-Element Generals, 三五三元) and the ceremonial attire for the generals.\n\nThe third rank encompasses the diagrams of *Zhōngyuán* (Mid-Element, 中元), *Xiàyuán* (Lower Element, 下元), and *Shàngyuán Hánhóng* (Upper Element Encompassing Grandeur, 上元含弘), as well as the *Liúshū* (Falling Pearls, 流珠) diagrams.\n\nThe practitioner who stores and implements this method shall achieve true results.\n\n*Lǎojūn* (Laozi/Old Master) says: \"Those who practice the *Kǎozhào* (Summoning and Inspecting, 考召) method and perambulate the ten directions of the world, rescuing and guiding beings, always acting in equanimity, benefiting the state and their own families, aiding people and saving all things, and performing meritorious deeds between heaven and earth—when their virtue is complete, the *Tàishàng* (Highest Venerable) shall command celestial beings to escort them upward, granting them the position of *Dàxiān Zhēn* (Great Immortal True Person, 大仙真). They shall ascend to the heavenly palaces in broad daylight.\n\nIn ancient times, there was a *Rénhuáng* (Human Sovereign, 人皇) who constantly performed hidden virtues for the people, reverently honoring the four categories of heaven, earth, water, and fire, and never failing to uphold them. Moreover, he would daily visualize his own body, perambulating the world within his mind, inspecting and judging beings, ensuring fairness and justice. Those who suffered wrongs or bore grievances wished to see their cases resolved, and in their dreams, they would encounter the *Rénhuáng* (Human Sovereign), who would explain their grievances to them. For fourteen years, he consistently cultivated this method, and whenever common folk faced injustice or bore grievances, they would dream of the *Rénhuáng* (Human Sovereign) resolving their cases. Upon waking, each would know their own guilt, and both parties would blame themselves. Countless thousands of people experienced this.\n\nWhen his virtue was complete, the *Tàishàng* (Highest Venerable) granted him longevity, making him the *Rénhuáng* (Human Sovereign) with a lifespan of eighteen thousand years. Later, he ascended to the *Xiānqiū* (Celestial Mound, 玄丘) as an immortal.\n\nIn ancient times, there was a *Shùshì* (Magician, 術士) named *Lèbā* (樂巴), who skillfully practiced *Cúnxī* (Storing Thought, 存思) and the perambulation of the world, rescuing and aiding beings, subduing gods and pacifying spirits. For decades, he benefited people, and the populace erected temples in his honor across several districts.\n\nSuddenly, a calamity struck the district, and the people sacrificed to *Lèbā* (樂巴). The calamity dispersed instantly. It was not because *Lèbā* (樂巴) himself possessed divine communication, but because his *cúnxī* (stored thought) and visualization evoked a response. Furthermore, the spirits and gods feared and respected his practice, foreknowing their own fate, and thus retreated and dispersed in advance.\n\nThus, it is known that this method’s divine communication is supremely wondrous. *Lǎojūn* (Laozi/Old Master) once descended to *Shǔjùn* (Sichuan District, 蜀郡) and told *Lèbā* (樂巴): \"This method has seven extraordinary powers: first, it can rescue people and establish merit; second, it can command the reverence of ghosts and spirits; third, it can swiftly attain the Dao of immortality; fourth, it can enter battlefields without injury; fifth, it can enter water, fire, and epidemics without contamination; sixth, it can dispel all slander and disputes, both public and private; seventh, it can establish prohibitions against all venomous serpents, fierce beasts, and toxic creatures, compelling them to suppress their malevolent hearts so they dare not harm others—this is most efficacious.\n\nTo practice the *Kǎozhào* (Summoning and Inspecting) method, one must first, under a clear master’s guidance, receive the *Běnjīng guì* (Scripture and Talisman of the Original Scripture, 本經箓). The *Běnjīng guì* (Scripture and Talisman of the Original Scripture) refers to the *Jīnsuǒ Liúzhū* (Golden Lock Falling Pearls, 金鎖流珠). There are diagrams within the scripture, such as the *Sānyuán Wǔxíng* (Three-Element Five-Phase, 三元五行) method.\n\nOne version states: ‘There are no Three-Element Generals, only the Five-Phase Generals’ diagram, along with the *Liùjiǎ Qīxīng Yùnǚ* (Six Celestial Stems Seven Stars Celestial Maiden, 六甲七星玉女) diagram.’ Each of the Three-Element Generals has their own diagram, which is why they are drawn out. The three generals of the *Shàngyuán* (Upper Element, 上元) are included within the *Hánhóng* (Encompassing Grandeur, 含弘) diagram. Within the *Hánhóng* (Encompassing Grandeur) diagram, the sun, moon, and three elements, the five phases, six celestial stems, seven stars, eight trigrams, and nine palaces, as well as the *Léitíng Yǔshī Fēngbó* (Thunder and Lightning Rain Masters Wind Lords, 雷霆雨師風伯), are all depicted in full detail.\n\nOnly after three years may one receive this *Yǐnshū* (Summoning Scripture, 引書). If one has not yet received it, they must not dare to view this text. This text is the *Yuánshǐ qì* (Primordial Beginning *Qi* of Heaven and Earth, 天地元始氣), structured into scripture by the *Zhēnrén* (True Person/Immortal, 真人). Initially, it was a *Tiānshū* (Heavenly Scripture, 天書); later, scholars approximated it to *Rúshū* (Confucian Scripture, 儒書), which is why the world now knows this method as a means to seek immortality.\n\nIt dispels toxins and subdues demons to flourish the Dao/Way. From the Zhou and Qin dynasties through the Han, many practiced this method faithfully.»\n\nThe world was filled with crafty sorcerers, so the Immortals concealed their secrets and ceased transmission.\n\nThe earlier Immortals, after ascending, left behind their unparalleled secrets for seven hundred years without successors.\n\nAt the beginning of the Later Jin dynasty, there were the **Zuo** brothers—**Zuo Yuanfang**, a man of Jiangdong, and **Xu Xun**, a man of Qin, now in Jingyang County of Shu. They succeeded in their Daoist lineage.\n\nAt the source of Hongji in Jiangxi, they took ten disciples, all of whom became Immortals. Practicing this method, they wandered to heal the world, cultivated virtue, and one by one ascended.\n\nAmong the later eleven disciples, none took further disciples, and the lineage of Immortals thus ended.\n\nA hundred years later, at the start of the Qi dynasty, the transmission resumed with **Ge Xuan** as disciple. After Ge Xuan’s era, two generations of **Zheng Siyuan** followed, yet no one could succeed them.\n\nScholars only spoke of the *qi* (器)—the great vessel, like the Confucian term *shuò* (硕)—yet none possessed even a single *hè* (合) of it. This was a metaphor for the world’s loss of the Immortal Way.\n\nThe **Laozi** told **Yin Xiānsheng**:\n\n*\"The Wandering Method—if one wholeheartedly seeks its use, nothing will be beyond one’s divine power. A single thought moves, and nothing obstructs it: above, it connects with Heaven; below, it connects with Earth; within, it connects with humanity; subtly, it connects with the numinous. Thus, one can repel ghosts and save people, never missing in a hundred uses, and no thousand evils dare approach.*\n\n*In ancient times, Guangcheng Jun taught the Yellow Emperor to use this method, enabling him to attain *Tiānzhēn* (Heavenly Purity). The Mysterious Woman instructed the Yellow Emperor in this Wandering Method, and after nine years, his mastery extinguished ghostly threats and transformed his Dao. He rode the Ox and Horse to pacify the people—this was the Lady of the Fan clan. Through dream-wandering, she was inspired by the Immortal’s leveling method—this was Wang Jun. Those who wandered and paid respects were the Ten Thousand Spirits and Heavenly Masters, the Wandering Immortal’s music. The True Person of the Celestial Connection wandered to rescue all beings. The Perfected One’s Wandering was met by the Ten Thousand Emperors. The Later Sage’s Wandering saw all the Celestial Beings come to greet, paying homage to the Ten Thousand Saints, subduing the Hundred Spirits, and nurturing all living beings.\"*\n\nRegarding the **Summoning Method for the Six Star Lords of Longevity**—the diagram for invoking the Six Star Lords of the Southern Dipper:\n\nThe **Laozi** said:\n*\"The Six Star Lords of Longevity are the Six Star Lords of the Southern Dipper. Flying from east to west, the Master focuses his mind toward the east, receiving them below. He also focuses on the Twelve True Persons flying from west to east, turning his face southward, gazing left and right. He further focuses on the Left Marshal of Destiny and the Right Marshal of Records, who oversee registries and calculations, all arriving together, riding flying dragons and phoenixes, dragons pulling grand chariots, with celestial boys and jade maidens holding the Ten Absolute Auspicious Banners. They scatter fragrant flowers in spiraling patterns, covering the sick person’s bed, scattering all manner of blossoms onto the patient’s body, penetrating to the bones and joints.*\n\n*The medicines are administered by the Marshals of Destiny and Records, who then charge the household to guard the home. The Three Generals, the Kitchen God, and the Well Spirit are summoned to bid farewell to the deceased, to recount the origins of the illness, and to ascend to the Northern Palace of Heaven to save the life. The Master embodies the **Taishang Laojun**, holding the True Essence and the Glare of Anger, never straying from his form.\"*\n\nThe Master sits upon a thousand-petaled lotus, composed and solemn.\nThough appearing wrathful, he commands the Three Generals guarding the home: *\"How dare malevolent spirits intrude upon this dwelling and torment a virtuous and prudent person? Swiftly retrieve the patient’s soul!\"*\n\nHe questions the Marshal of Destiny, then reproaches the household deities, territorial shrine officials, land and water spirits, and mountain cave deities: *\"Which spirit governs this place? Which deity oversees this dwelling’s jurisdiction? Why do you allow these demonic bandits to harm the living?\"*\n\nNow, by urgent decree, examine the patient’s fate records—life span and destiny—and promptly address this illness within a set number of days. Dispatch a swift report for salvation.\n\nThis method shall be inscribed on talismans and orders, affixed to the household deities, the Three Generals guarding the home, the well and kitchen dragons, and all myriad spirits. It shall also be posted at shrines and ancestral halls.\n\nThese are the ancient *fǔxiá* (符檄)—today’s talismans. Another account states: *\"Xí* (檄) is a scolding command, compelling malevolent spirits to tremble and depart. If they refuse, summon the shrine deities, the Three Generals guarding the home, and the door, well, and kitchen spirits to unite in seizing and binding them. Alongside the talismans and orders, issue simultaneous decrees to behead them—without guilt. Thus, the spirits are restrained, and the patient recovers within fourteen or twenty-one days without fail.\"\n\nLater, the Sage Emperor informed the Heavenly Master Dao Ling: *\"All mortals are born with their fates and destinies assigned...\"*\n\nThe **Command** is the vital body itself. What mortals receive at birth as their assigned fate and virtue is their official rank and the land where they draw their stipend—all subject to life and death. The perils of life and death arise from the Five Phases clashing and malevolent spirits conspiring in their operations. If one foreknows this, then from within the Five Phases, one may calculate and restrain them, halting the affliction at once. If they refuse, one may tread the *dìjì* (地纪) three times, don the *dòuyīn* (斗身衣), seize and behead them—thus permanently severing the calamity. Then the person may freely pursue cultivation and attain eternal life.\n\nThis method further draws upon the Five Phases’ central alignments. Later, the Sage Emperor instructed Master Yin the True Person: *\"To study the Dao, you must know the Six Jia Days. The Six Jia—Jiazi, Jiaxu, and the like—are six days in succession. Tread the *dìjì* three times, then scatter into the *Yǔbù* (禹步), three steps with nine traces, afterward donning the *dòuyīn*, preserving the Two Scenes and Three Elements, the Four Seasons’ *Qīnglóng* (青龙), *Báihǔ* (白虎), *Zhūquè* (朱雀), and *Xuánwǔ* (玄武)—these are the Four Seasons’ overseers of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. The Five Phases: as the Classics say, the Four Seasons’ deities, with the addition of the Yellow Court General, are called the Five Phases. It is also said: In Heaven, they are the Five Stars; on Earth, the Five Forms; in Man, the Five Phases—these are the Five Virtues, sealed by the Most High with their names.\n\nThe Six Jia are the direct-day deities and the Jade Maiden’s Lord. The Seven Stars are the Dipper; the Eight Trigrams are the eight directions of Earth. The Nine Palaces encompass Earth and the Central Palace, with the Human Sovereign’s likeness marking the Nine Provinces’ names, elucidating the Nine Palaces’ count. The Three Elements: one element yields three, hence ‘three threes as nine,’ all within the Five Phases. The Nine Palaces, adding the Central Palace, are called the Nine Numbers. It is also said: the Small Nine Palaces are the Nine Provinces’ lands. In the age of the Human Sovereign, this was also called the Nine Palaces—this explains the Small Nine’s count. Today, between Heaven and Earth, the eight directions and the Central Palace’s ninefold count are vast. Hence Zhuangzi said: Heaven has nine wilds, called the Nine Palaces. [Here follows the] containment of thunder and lightning strikes, as depicted in the diagram. The diagram is fully contained within the *Hán-Tóng Tú* (含弘图); retain its use. All methods are preserved for application. For warding off calamities, also employ the pinching technique of the Six Star Lords of Fate.\n\nOften thus, one may save one’s own family and others’ illnesses, rescuing the dying and restoring life. Practicing this for six years, the Southern Dipper extends longevity, and the Six Star Lords—including the Lords of Fate and Records—descend to meet you, speaking of your merits in saving lives and healing diseases, and escort you to ascend to the Upper Clarity.\n\nThe Celestial Master told the Emperor: *\"There are nine grades to this method. The first is to cultivate and remove one’s own calamities and illnesses. The second is to heal one’s family and kin. The third is to treat the illnesses of kings and ministers, each with its own rank and prescribed method. The highest is to treat the Son of Heaven’s ailments. First, contemplate the Upper Element’s Upper Division’s Tang General, then the Upper Element’s Middle Division’s Li General, then the Upper Element’s Lower Division’s Xu General, then the Middle Element’s Upper Division’s Tang General—this Tang is surnamed Tang, named Hóng, succeeding the Upper Element’s Upper Division’s Tang General in years. The Upper Element’s Tang General, named Duàn, was a man of the Heavenly Sovereign’s era, attaining the Dao with a body nine hundred million *zhang* long. The Middle Element’s Middle Division’s Ge General was a man of King Mu’s time, far removed in years. Next is the Middle Element’s Lower Division’s Zhou General—also from King Mu’s era, a minister of his court. Then come the Three Generals of the Lower Element: Li Huangwang. They were men of the Six Dynasties. Li General was surnamed Li, named Lìzhì, a native of Kuàiji Mountain. In the Qin era, he attained the Dao, and the Most High appointed him as the Upper General of the Lower Element. Next, contemplate the all-pervasive [method], as depicted in the diagram. This is the *Hán-Tóng* [method].\"*\n\nNow, summon the Six Longevity Star Lords—six in number—and the Twelve True Persons of the Southern Dipper. Next, summon the Nine Lords of the Northern Dipper, then the Lords of Destiny (司命君), the Lords of Records (司录君), and the Lords of Registers and Fate-Calculations (掌籍掌罔算君)—five in total. Then come the Southern Dipper’s Registrar of Births and the Northern Dipper’s Registrar of Deaths, all arriving together with their retinues of officials, soldiers, and countless myriads—speaking of \"hundred thousands,\" meaning ten million, the number of the great assembly. All assemble in a certain realm.\n\nThe altar is set with thirty-four seats: seven to the east, seven to the south, seven to the west, seven to the north, seven in the central palace, two for the Eight Trigrams, two for the Sun Palace, two for the Moon Palace, and the remaining nine seats for the Seven Ancestors, totaling forty-nine. The platform is built with yellow earth spread upon the ground, with mats laid above, and upon the mats, green silk cushions for sitting, as prescribed.\n\n*\"As prescribed\"* refers to the complete ritual for summoning the Six Longevity Star Lords, with their full ceremonial texts. The ritual text, once complete, already includes all required items and their proper counts—here, it is summarized rather than fully detailed.\n\nUpon completion, meditate upon the Six Longevity Star Lords, as well as the Lords of Destiny and Records, and perform the rites according to the previous methods. No illness treated will fail to heal.\n\n**Second Rank (for nobles and high officials):**\nTo treat the ailments of princes and ministers, first invoke the Upper Division’s Middle Element Li General, then the Middle Division’s Middle Element Ge General, and finally the Lower Division’s Middle Element Huang General. With the ritual fully prepared, meditate upon the Six Longevity Star Lords, the Lords of Destiny, and the Lords of Records, extending life and curing disease through the prescribed steps and incantations—no illness will resist.\n\n**Third Rank (for officials and commoners):**\nFor governors, county magistrates, and the populace—regardless of gender—first meditate upon the Upper Division’s Lower Element Xu General, then the Middle Division’s Lower Element Zhou General, and finally the Lower Division’s Lower Element Wang General. With the ritual fully prepared, summon the Six Longevity Star Lords, the Lords of Destiny, and the Lords of Records to descend, prolonging life, curing disease, and saving those at the brink of death. Results manifest instantly.\n\nFor treating all manner of illnesses, these three ranks suffice—none will fail. The talismans are found in *The Three Departments’ Miscellaneous Talismans* (《三部杂符》), named according to the ailment, and all will prove effective when entrusted to the proper authority.\n\n**Fourth:** Able to enter battlefields, rendering one unseen by harm or defeat, protecting oneself and others. The method follows as before, with talismans provided separately. These talismans appear in *The Yellow Emperor’s Gathered Mysteries* (《黄帝集灵记》), Volume One.\n\n**Fifth:** Able to enter water, seizing water spirits, dragons, and aquatic creatures of the fish and reptile kind. The method involves stepping the *Earth Memoir* (地纪) seven times and the *Flying Heavenly Rope* (飞天纲) seven times. This is the *Flying Steel Rope*—though not traced on the diagram, one need only visualize the steps upon the ground as per the illustration to achieve it. If mastery of the steps is attained, the *Flying Rope* need not be invoked; visualization alone suffices. In urgent matters, focus the mind, recite the hand seals, and chant the incantation—divine response follows instantly. Why bother with steps or diagrams?\n\nIn ancient times, the Daoist adept Zhao Rui practiced the *Memoir-Rope* method for fourteen years. Upon attaining the Dao, he could summon its power with mere thought, requiring no steps. He habitually walked the *Yujian Steps* (禹步), nine strides nine times, mastering the Nine Rivers. He also transformed into twelve steps, governing the Four Seas. Binding his feet with six *ji* (己) earth seals allowed him to enter water as if walking on land.\n\nAt the moment of entering water, he would recite the *Six Wu* (六戊) incantation, commanding the water spirits at will—all obeyed.\n\n**Sixth:** Able to guide one through mountains and grasslands without losing one’s way, causing venomous serpents and fierce beasts to submit, and entering fire without harm. All effects manifest as per the previous methods.\n\n**Seventh:** Able to lead one into the Middle Immortal path, achieving longevity and immortality. On one’s birth-day, meditate upon the Southern Dipper’s Six Longevity Star Lords, as well as the Lords of Destiny, Records, Registers, and Fate-Calculations descending as per the diagram. The diagram appears in *The Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl* (《金锁流珠》), Middle Section.\n\nUpon completion, step the *Earth Memoir* and *Flying Rope*—the *Earth Memoir* and *Heavenly Rope*. Scatter the steps, adjust the attire, and recite the nineteen incantations while manipulating the seals. Then recite the *Lords of Destiny* seals, found in the *Flowing Pearl*’s Lower Section, Volume. Finally, chant the nineteen incantations. Upon completion, cease. Practicing thus for four years grants the rank of Earthly Immortal.\n\n**Eighth:** Able to lead one to the Great Immortal path. The Great Immortal is the celestial and terrestrial sage. Some say *Heavenly Immortal* and *Earthly Immortal*, dwelling in mountains.\n\n**Ninth:** Able to guide one, through prolonged practice, to the rank of Supreme True Person. The True Person is the title of the Upper Clarity’s Great Primordial Sage Official. In antiquity, the Supreme Celestial True Saints—such as Guangchengzi and hundreds of other True Persons—all achieved their state through stepping the *Memoir-Rope*, donning the *Dipper Garments* (衣斗), and meditating upon the *Dippers*. The *Dipper Garments* refer to the Northern Dipper; *meditating upon the Dippers* refers to the Southern Dipper.\n\nThe Northern Dipper has nine stars, but two are unseen—commoners see only seven. Hence, they are called the *Seven Star Lords*, though unknown are the nine stars and the two *Precision Lords* (二精君). The Southern Dipper has eight stars, but two are unseen—commoners see only six, hence called the *Six Star Lords*, though unknown are the eight stars and the two *Trigram Lords* (二卦君).\n\nThe first is the Longevity Lord, the second the Lord of Destiny; the rest are the Lords of Registers, Fate-Calculations, and the Lords of Birth and Death. Those who know this path achieve immortality and become sages instantly—unbound by form, through prolonged cultivation, attaining Heavenly Immortality.\n\n*Conclusion of Volume Twenty-Eight of The Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl*\n*Beginning of Volume Twenty-Nine of The Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl*\n\n「The Great True Sage of the Central Realm, Lord of the Dao, **Fāng Píng Zhāng Dàolíng**, **Zhào Shēng**, **Wáng Chǎng**, **Lǐ Zhòngfǔ**, **Máo Yíng**, **Xǔ Yùfǔ** and others, are successive compilers of this text. The Daoist Master **Lǐ Chúnfēng** annotated it. The **Consideration and Summoning Master** expounds the method of **invoking the Wood Official (木官)** to **erect a house (起屋)** and heal illness.\n\nThe **Venerable Laozi** instructed the **True Person of Saving the Suffering (救苦真人)**, **Zhèng Rén'ān**, saying: *\"As a True Person practicing the Dao, nothing surpasses saving those afflicted with grave illness.\"* To save one person’s illness, the heavens and earth record it as one merit.\n\nThe human body is called a *dwelling-place (舍宅)*, akin to a house. Thus, to heal the sick, one invokes the **Wood Official (木官)**. The Wood Official is, among the Five Phases, the one who governs wood. For instance, if a person born in the **Year of Jiāzǐ (甲子)** has a **Metal Destiny (金命)**, then **Wùchén Wood Official (戊辰木官)** is invoked as the superior—never **Rénwǔ Wood Official (壬午木官)** to erect a house, lest harm befall the patient.\n\nWhen descending, align with the patient’s **main house (正屋)** and **auxiliary house (正屋)**, as if tracing a diagram. **Felling trees to erect the main house**, **repairing beams and pillars**. Thus, in three days, all illnesses retreat and abate. Further, it is said: *\"When a person’s illness is grave, and you, as a master, seek to heal them, merely visualize the patient’s main house and its trees felled—it shall manifest, and the illness shall retreat.\"* The scripture states: *\"House upright, body upright; house crooked, body crooked. House fallen, body fallen.\"*\n\nAnother passage says: *\"The human body is a house; if the surrounding trees are numerous, the soul and spirit scatter from the body and cling to the trees, often seen by others as luminous figures—these are the souls and spirits of the ailing.\"* As a healer, first invoke the **Wood Official** to **fell the trees on either side of the patient’s dwelling**, then **summon the wood and the illness**, constructing a house upon the **birth-qi (生炁)** of the land. The patient’s **Six Heavenly Stems (六甲)** and **Twelve Earthly Branches (行年)** determine the birth-qi location, or also **search the year’s birth-qi** to erect the house, or **repair the existing dwelling**. If all three houses are upright, the patient’s **three souls (三魂)** remain steadfast. But if one house is crooked, one soul shall not be fixed.\n\nFor the healer, first master this method, and it shall prove efficacious. The patient’s illness shall retreat, their spirit returning to the body. That night, they may dream of **ascending sages entering a valley of half-suffering (上仙入谷半苦)**—this is the spirit’s return. Upon waking, they sweat profusely, a sign of great recovery.\n\nThe **Venerable Laozi** said: *\"This method has two applications: one to heal a person’s illness, the other to subdue rebellious subjects, disobedient children, or disciples who defy their master’s commands—then apply this method to them.\"* The practice is similar to the previous.\n\nThe **Venerable Laozi** said: *\"For this method, first tread the **Earthly Trigrams (地纪)** three times, then scatter into the **Yǔ Steps (禹步)**—the initial **Nine Steps (初九迹)**. Then reverse and return to the **Trigram Head (纲头)**, and repeat the invocation. Open as **Twelve Steps (十二迹)**, then reverse and open as **Fifteen Steps (十五迹)**. Upon completion, align the **Left and Right Garments (左右配衣)**—the diagram shows both the **Left Garment Method (左配衣法)** and the **Four Battles (斗名)**. The **Right Garment Method (右配衣法)** is also called the **Four Battles (四斗)**—referring to the alignment of left and right garments. In the **First Step Diagram of the Flowing Pearl (《流珠》上卷第一步纲图)**, all follow the pattern of one left and one right. Simply verify and apply as needed.*\n\nInvoke the **Wood Official** to **erect a house (起屋)**—this is to **rectify life (治生)**. **Felling the house (倒屋)**—this is to **rectify death (治死)**. Either method may be chosen at will. The **incantation** lies in the **middle joint of the left ring finger (左手第四指中节)**, twisting it. Or bind it with **five-colored threads (五色线)** for an extended duration.\n\n**Conjure the Venerable Laozi**, the **Primordial Origin (先天地生)**—**conjure the withered wood to regrow branches and leaves (摄枯木花叶再生)**, able to heal a person’s illness swiftly and restore equilibrium.** **Summon and bind the soul and spirit (召摄魂魄)**, ordering them to return to their bodily form. **Upright house, upright body—quickly arise and complete.** *As fast as the ritual decree.*\n\nThe **Posterity Sage (后圣君)** said: *\"When invoking the Wood Official to erect a house for the sick, there are numbers and hierarchical levels. The highest is for kings and emperors—erecting a main house and auxiliary house for **forty thousand people (四十万人)**, with **ten thousand per region (一方十万人)**. The middle is for prime ministers and high officials—**four thousand people (四千人)**, with **one thousand per region (一方一千人)**. The lowest is for the **five ranks (五品)** down to commoners—**four hundred people (四百人)**, with **one hundred per region (一方一百人)**. Together, they erect the main house and auxiliary house, fell trees and gather wood, grasp earth and clear grass—grass being the **commoner’s term for killing qi (杀炁)** or **calamity (殃)**. They raise pillars, install beams, and frame the house. At the appointed time, they visualize and complete it—house built, patient recovered.\"* **Proclaiming the decree:** *\"The Wood Official swiftly constructs the house; house completed, the patient’s fortune flourishes. Fortune born, soul and spirit return to form. Illness vanishes, blessings received—long life attained.\"* *As fast as the ritual decree.*\n\nThe **incantation for restoring the soul and returning the spirit (捻还魂入神正魄诀)** is in the **middle joint of the left thumb (左手大指中节)**, binding it with **five-colored silk (五色丝)** for **forty-nine days (二七日)**.\n\nThe **Venerable Laozi** told **Luó Zhēnrén**: *\"Luó Wénqiáng, a great minister of the **Yīn Dynasty (殷)**, was skilled in **ritual prohibitions and incantations (禁咒之术)**. He often aided people in averting disasters and healing illnesses, fulfilling his merits by the **third wǔ (三午)**. He ascended in broad daylight. This method has multiple applications: one to heal illness, two to **ward off evil (辟恶)**, three to **treat afflictions and harm (治患害)**, four to **dissolve slander (消口舌)**, five to **prohibit (禁)**, six to **translocate (移)**, seven to **defeat (败)**.* These seven methods can address both auspicious and inauspicious matters.\n\nThe rest I heard from my master’s lips, passed orally—keep it secret and do not divulge.\n\n**The Consideration and Summoning Master** expounds the method of **visualizing the roaming body (说身巡游)** and **inspecting the patient’s home (病家图法)**.\n\nThe **Venerable Laozi** told **Wénqiáng Zhēnrén**: *\"For a Daoist master to aid others as a healer, to tread and prohibit illnesses, is no simple task. They must first purify their body and calm their mind. Whether prohibiting or incanting, all serve to heal a hundred maladies—this is a great merit. This single method cures illness: the master first visualizes and enters the patient’s home, passing through the door into their chamber. Seeing the patient lying on their bed, the master invokes and summons, visualizing a **wild troop of horses (阵野马)** and **scattered soldiers (散吏兵)**, seizing clubs to drive them away, trampling them as **malevolent ghosts and thieves (祟鬼贼)**, startling them into fleeing and scattering. Again, visualize **great wild elephants (野堵大象)** and **lions (师子)** coming in one by one, entering the chamber, devouring food as **demonic spirits and wild ghosts (妖精野鬼)**, then fleeing.\"*\n\n«Again, visualize **serpents (蛇)**, **centipedes (蜈蚣)**, and other venomous creatures (毒物), seizing and capturing them as **malevolent ghosts, thieves, and demonic spirits (祟鬼贼精邪)**, driving them away and scattering them.\n\nThen, invoke the **specific demonic entity (某鬼)**—each has its own classification: **mountain ghosts (山鬼)**, **spirits (精鬼)**, **injury ghosts (傷鬼)**, **goblins and specters (魍魉)**, **demonic monkeys and rodents (邪精猴鼠)**, or **hobgoblins, forest imps, and other malevolent spirits (魑魅精鬼)**. These classifications are found in the *Liu Zhu* [\"Falling Pearls\"] **palm incantations (掌訣)**.\n\nThe **incantation method (法訣)** states: The master first treads the ground three times, stepping in the **Yugaito’s stride (禹步)**, three steps with nine traces (三步九迹), three repetitions (三遍), then adjusts their attire (配衣). After adjusting their attire, the master holds the **Arcid star (魒星)** with their left hand, pointing it seven times (七遍), then visualizes themselves clad in **purple robes (紫衣)** and a **traveler’s hat (远游冠)**, accompanied by **generals and soldiers (侍从将军吏兵)** as before. The master proceeds to the patient’s home—whether in **such-and-such State, County, or Village (某州县乡里)**, or a **certain official (某官人)** or **commoner (某百姓)**—declaring, *“This commoner (百姓) has contracted this illness,”* and so forth.\n\nThe master leads the soldiers with ropes to drive the horses, galloping and trampling the malevolent ghosts. In the *Liu Zhu Tu* [\"Falling Pearls Diagram\"], **lions (师子)** are not depicted—only **pigs and horses (猪马)** along with soldiers—though fewer in number. The master says: *“Visualizing the lion brings it forth; there is no need to draw it.”*\n\nThe **oral incantation (口訣)** states:\n*“Snakes, centipedes, crows, and other fierce beings (禹乌之猛)—all that must be prohibited—are demonic spirits that devour ghosts. Using this method immediately cures illness (食鬼治病，用之立差).”*\n\nWhen **lions (师子)** and other wild beasts are invoked, they charge into the dwelling, roaming left and right within and without. They seize and devour the malevolent ghosts, and the patient’s illness is immediately cured—there is none who does not recover (无有不差者).\n\nThe **Celestial Master (天师)** says: *“I transmit these oral incantations to the later sages. This method has three applications:\n1. To heal human illness (救人病),\n2. To cause malevolent individuals to fall ill themselves, preventing them from coming to harm me (令恶人自病，去不来害我),\n3. To dismantle the dwellings of ghosts and spirits, which vanish immediately upon doing so (破鬼神居止之处，立即见消).”*\n\nIn the past, there was **Bian Que (扁鹊)**, who often practiced this method to cure the sick—all recovered (皆.差). Time and again, he did so.\n\nOne day, **the Highest Daoist Lord (太上大道君)** sent a messenger to bestow upon him the **method of reviving the dead (起死人之法)**. Suddenly, he could **split open the abdomen and treat the intestines (破腹治肠)**, distinguishing the **five viscera (五藏)**. He revived **Pei’s Crown Prince (虢太子)**, **Zhou’s Marquis of Shun (周顺侯)**, and **Yan’s King’s Concubine (燕王次妃)**, who had all died. Afterward, they lived for **twenty, thirty, or ten years (二十年、三十年、十年)** before dying again.\n\nQue lived for **seventy-nine years (七十九年)** in this world, repeatedly reviving those who had died—no one knows the number.\n\nLater, one day, **a wind officer (风吏)** and **a thunder master (雷师)** arrived to escort him to the imperial court (御前), with **the Azure Dragon (青龙)** and **the White Tiger (白虎)** supporting him on either side. Thousands of officials rode ahead, guiding him to **the Southern Mountains (南山)** before he departed. No one knows to whom he passed on the **method of reviving the dead (起死法)**.\n\nIn the present age, no one practices this method.»\n\n「Again, there was **Zhao Mountain (赵山)**, who served as the **Magistrate of Xīhé (西河令)** during the reign of **Emperor Wǔ of Hàn (汉武帝)**. His wife, **Mistress Mèng (孟氏)**, was known as **Chángzhēn (常真)**, and from a young age, she studied under her father, earnestly seeking to master this **Daoist technique (此术)**.\n\n**Mistress Mèng (孟氏)**, by nature, had a profound affinity for the **Dao (道)**. Even as a child of eight or nine, she could read and recognize characters. Upon seeing her father’s **Daoist scriptures (此书)**, she would repeatedly observe and recite them until she knew them thoroughly.\n\nLater, someone suddenly fell ill, and she, with deep contemplation and **qi (炁)**-focused intent, went to aid them. Often, she succeeded in many cases, and soon, people came to seek her assistance in great numbers. Her husband, aware of this, forbade her.\n\nYet, whenever she heard of someone suffering from illness, she would simply **store their condition in her mind (心念)**, and so she did for **forty-five years (四十五年)**.\n\nOne day, **the Celestial Sovereign (太上)**—the **Venerable Sage (后圣李君)**—sent an emissary, presenting her with **the Six Jia talismans (六甲符文)** and the **Mèng family’s scriptures and ritual attire (孟氏书服)**. After **fourteen years (一十四年)**, she suddenly departed. Her physical body ascended into the sky and vanished into the mountains, leaving no trace.\n\nShe then learned **the Method of Summoning the Daoist Master (召法师存思说)** to invoke the **Four Celestial Guardians (青龙白虎朱雀玄武)** and the **Diagram of Vitality (镇疾图法)**—a technique taught by **Lǎozi (老君)** to **Chìdì (赤帝)**, who was **Zhèng Rén’ān (郑仁安)**. He had received this method in the **Western Realm (西国)**.\n\nThe **Four Celestial Guardians (四镇大神)** were summoned through talismans and commandments, declaring:\n*\"In this world, there are four great guardian deities, who can protect and guard humans, subdue and command malevolent spirits, and shield people from untimely death. Those who practice the **Dao (道)** with sincerity and devotion, when their merit is fulfilled, ascend to the heavens. The **Azure Dragon (青龙)** resides on the left; it is originally a deity of the **Wood Star (木星)** from the celestial realm. It favors longevity in humans and cherishes the **vitality (生)** that nurtures life. It opposes death, for death is the end of human vitality. This deity abhors the sight of death, so the **Celestial Sovereign (太上)** commands it through talismans to protect living humans and subdue death spirits, thus safeguarding the homes of the living. It averts harm from **deceitful words (非横口舌)**, **malevolent ghosts (凶鬼)** biting at people, **spellcraft poisons (蛊毒)** blocking doors, and **non-corporeal spirits (非尸之字)**. Even **serpents (蛇)** and their venomous substances can be repelled by this method, preventing them from causing harm.*\n\n*This method is typically practiced at night, or both day and night—once daily, once nocturnally. Without interruption, if one **stores the condition in mind (存思)** for three days, the effects should manifest and the illness should abate. First, one must **step the Gāng (纲) Diagram (步)**. **Storing (存)** refers to the mental cultivation of the **Gāng Diagram (纲图)** and the **Jì (纪) Step (步)** method, as well as the **Steel Method (钢法)**. The **Venerable Sage (后圣君)** instructed **Yín Zhēnren (尹真人)**:\n*'The **Jì Diagram (蹑纪)** and **Yǔ’s Step (禹步)** require seven years of practice for their merit to take effect. It is not necessary to physically perform the steps yourself. Simply **store them in your mind (心存)** as if visualizing the **Gāng Diagram (纲图)**. If you **embody the steps (存身)** and traverse the **Jì Diagram (纪纪)**, crossing the **Steel Method (钢过)**, the effects will be achieved. If the effects are not yet manifest, you must **step the Gāng Diagram (步纲)** and **Jì Diagram (镊纪)** method. Three traversals of the **Earth Diagram (地纪)**, three repetitions of **Yǔ’s Step (禹步)** with nine traces, and three strikes on the left and right sides while coordinating with the **Heavenly Diagram (天式)**. Then, **twist the Earth’s Vitality Point (地心目)**, shout three times, and chant to **summon and subdue (摄)** the **Four Celestial Guardians (四神)**, as well as the **Earth Deities (地神)** and **Earth Axis Deities (地轴神)**, to relocate mountains, rivers, seas, and reshape their breadth and expanse—whether near or far—without difficulty.*\n\n*This method also includes **Heavenly and Earthly Ritual Coordination (天地式相应)**. With time, one can move freely in and out of the world. The **Five Grades of Verification (五等验极)** are its ultimate tests.*\n\n*The **Celestial Sovereign (太上)** further stated:\n*'Those who practice **Daoist techniques (道术)** must do so with **true sincerity (真心)**, without deceit or fraud, without greed, without anger, and without delusion. Only such individuals can **uphold and practice (行持)** this method. If one’s heart is not true, if there is delusion, anger, greed, or deceit, they are unfit to practice this method. Do not imitate the wicked. One must first purify and rectify oneself, ensuring they are worthy of this practice. Now, if you only practice the **Dao of healing and saving people (救人治病之道)**, Heaven and Earth will bestow merit upon you, and you will attain the **Dao of Ascension (仙道)** day by day.*\n\n*In recent times, there was a **Daoist adept (道士)**, **Huáng Lúzi (黄卢子)**, from **Gěyuè (葛越)**. He often practiced **qi control and prohibition techniques (炁禁之术)**, invoking the **Four Celestial Guardians (四神)** and the **Earth Deities (地神)** and **Earth Axis Deities (地轴神)** to command and subdue the **landscape (江山)**. With ease, he could **fold mountains (回山)**—meaning he could condense a thousand *lǐ* of terrain into the span of a single *lǐ* (一里之地), or expand a single *lǐ* into a thousand *lǐ* (千里江山)—without effort. He could also **shrink the earth and turn the seas (缩地转海)**.*\n\n*This method also requires **treading the Jì Diagram (蹑地纪)** for six years. Then, with prolonged breathing and **mental storage (存)**, one invokes the **Four Celestial Guardians (四神)**, the **Earth Deities (地神)**, and the **Earth Axis Deities (地轴神)**, always carrying the **talismans of the Earth Deities and Earth Axis Deities (地神地轴等箓)**. One must **tread the Jì Diagram (蹑纪)** three times, then disperse into **Yǔ’s Step (禹步)** three times, followed by three repetitions of the **Cutting Off Earthly Veins Step (绝地脉步)**. Then, one aligns with the **Heavenly Diagram (天式)**, striking three times on the left and right sides while coordinating. Next, one **twists the Earth’s Vitality Point (地心目)** and shouts three times, chanting to **summon and subdue (摄)** the **Four Celestial Guardians (四神)**, the **Earth Deities (地神)**, and the **Earth Axis Deities (地轴神)**. This enables the **transformation and relocation of mountains, rivers, and seas (移山河江海)**, altering their width and breadth—whether distant or near—without difficulty.*\n\n*This method also includes **Heavenly and Earthly Ritual Coordination (天地式相应)**. In time, one can move freely in and out of the world. The **Five Grades of Verification (五等验极)** are its ultimate tests.\n\n*The **Celestial Sovereign (太上)** further instructed:\n*'The **Daoist Master (天师)** who receives the **Venerable Sage’s command (后圣君诀)** must bind the **fourth finger of the left hand (左手第四指)** at its first joint with **five-colored silk threads (五色丝线)**, ensuring they never loosen. Within **five days and nights (五日及夜)**, the **ghost’s eyes will be blinded (鬼目盲)**, and the **human’s eyes will turn green (人目青)**. By the **tenth day (十日)**, the effects will dissipate.*\n\n*'For those who practice **Daoist techniques (道术)**, they must do so with **true sincerity (真心)**, without deceit or fraud, without greed, without anger, and without delusion. Only such individuals can **uphold and practice (行持)** this method. If one’s heart is not true and upright, if they harbor delusion, anger, greed, or deceit, they are unfit to practice this method. Do not imitate the wicked. One must first purify and rectify oneself, ensuring they are worthy of this practice. Now, if you only practice the **Dao of healing and saving people (救人治病之道)**, Heaven and Earth will bestow merit upon you, and you will attain the **Dao of Ascension (仙道)** day by day.*\n\n*'In the present age, people do not understand this. They only blame and resent the **ghosts (鬼)**. Yet the **ghosts (鬼)** cannot themselves cause such harm. They do so by **borrowing the authority of Heavenly and Earthly officials (假天地官之威)**, thus **riding on that power to create mischief (即乘威而作祟)**.*\n\n*Those who hold **Daoist official positions (仙官之位)** all possess **authority (威)**. They command **Heavenly deities (天神)** and **Earthly deities (地只)**, overseeing the **nine lands and ten thousand kingdoms (九土万国)**, as well as **community deities (社神)** and **temple deities (庙神)**. These two categories of deities—one **aiding and healing virtuous people (救治吉人)**, the other **subduing and punishing malevolent and rebellious individuals (征伐恶逆之徒)**—all act according to Heaven’s will. If you **embody the Heavenly method (以子身受天之法)** and **wear the Heavenly talismans (带天之文)**, your body becomes that of a **Heavenly official (天官)**. Then, you can execute Heaven’s commands, **upholding righteousness (执直其心取仁)** and **without favoritism or partiality (无亲无偏党之性)**, **without covetous desires (无傍偷之欲)**, and with a **lofty and distant aspiration (清高志远)**. Such individuals can **endure and generate life (久远生生)**, never retreating but always advancing in wisdom. They alone can be entrusted with this method.*\n\n*To **administer the Heavenly Law (掌行天法)**, one must **grasp the key to repentance and salvation (悔救之诀)**. This method must not be **recklessly transmitted (不可妄传)** to those unworthy, as the crime will extend to **seven generations (七代)** and bring **calamity and annihilation (殃没)** to oneself. The **Daoist Master (天师)** who receives the **Venerable Sage’s command (后圣君诀)** must observe these strictures.*」\n\n...**fully mastered through oral instruction.** The **Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl** method for summoning the twenty-ninth scroll is thus complete.\n\n*(Note: \"具口\" here is rendered as \"fully mastered\" to maintain consistency with the previous translation's emphasis on mastery and transmission. \"金锁流珠引卷\" is a Daoist ritual term, left unannotated per guidelines.)*",

Then, one harmonizes with Heaven and Earth, summoning the divine spirits.\n\n　　Annotation: This method serves two purposes: first, to heal oneself; second, to retain surplus **virtue/power** (*dé*) for healing others.\n\n　　Its application is swift against calamities of water and fire.\n\n　　The *Celestial Lord* (*Lǎojūn*) instructed the *Supreme Void High Spirit Flying Morning Central Daoist Sovereign* (*Tàixū Shànglíng Fēichén Zhōngyāng Dàojūn*), who shaped the *Earthly Poles* as the *Seven-Star Dipper* (*Qīxīng Dǒu*). Annotation: The form of the *Seven-Star Dipper* (*Dǒu*).\n\n　　Annotation: *Long Life* (*Chángshēng*) emerges from the *Five Sufferings* (*Wǔkǔ*), the starting point of one’s life span. Annotation: The *Five Sufferings* (*Wǔkǔ*) are the calculations of the *Five Phases* (*Wǔyùn*).\n\n　　For instance, if one’s life is governed by the *Metal Phase* (*Jīn*), their vitality lies in *Peri* (*Sì*), for *Peri* is *Long Life*. Their death occurs in *Zi* (*Child*), and their burial in *Chǒu* (*Buffalo*). *Zi* and *Chǒu* are the *Five Sufferings*, and one steps out from them into *Long Life*—thus, it is called *Exiting Death and Entering Life* (*Chūsǐ Rùshēng*).\n\n　　For those governed by the *Wood Phase* (*Mù*), vitality lies in *Hài* (*Boar*), for *Hài* is *Long Life*. Their death occurs in *Wǔ* (*Horse*), and their burial in *Wèi* (*Sheep*). *Wǔ* and *Wèi* are the *Five Sufferings*.\n\n　　For those governed by the *Water Phase* (*Shuǐ*), vitality lies in *Shēn* (*Monkey*), for *Shēn* is *Long Life*. Their death occurs in *Mǎo* (*Rabbit*), and their burial in *Chén* (*Dragon*). *Mǎo* and *Chén* are the *Five Sufferings*.\n\n　　For those governed by the *Fire Phase* (*Huǒ*), vitality lies in *Yín* (*Tiger*), for *Yín* is *Long Life*. Their death occurs in *Yǒu* (*Rooster*), and their burial in *Xū* (*Dog*). *Yǒu* and *Xū* are the *Five Sufferings*.\n\n　　For those governed by the *Earth Phase* (*Tǔ*), the calculations are the same as those for the *Water Phase*. One takes the *Five Sufferings* as the starting points for vitality, death, and burial, and the *Eight Hardships* and *Nine Calamities* as the *Nine Difficulties* (*Jiǔ È*).\n\n　　The ancient true immortals all taught this method. It is called *Transcending the Five Sufferings and Eight Hardships*, *Dispelling the Nine Calamities*, and *Healing a Hundred Illnesses*—the master leads the disciple to ascend the framework.\n\n　　The later *Celestial Lord* (*Shàngjūn*) introduced the *Great Youth Lord* (*Dàtóngjūn*) and the *Lesser Youth Lord* (*Xiǎotóngjūn*), allowing one to exit the *Five Sufferings* and enter *Long Life*.\n\n　　Next, one proceeds from *Long Life* into the *King* and *Minister* phases. Annotation: For the *Metal Phase* (*Jīn*), vitality lies in *Peri* (*Sì*), and the *King* phase is in *Yǒu* (*Rooster*). For the *Wood Phase* (*Mù*), vitality lies in *Hài* (*Boar*), and the *King* phase is in *Mǎo* (*Rabbit*). For the *Water Phase* (*Shuǐ*), vitality lies in *Shēn* (*Monkey*), and the *King* phase is in *Zi* (*Child*). For the *Fire Phase* (*Huǒ*), vitality lies in *Yín* (*Tiger*), and the *King* phase is in *Wǔ* (*Horse*). For the *Earth Phase* (*Tǔ*), the calculations are the same as those for the *Water Phase*. The *Five Lineages* (*Wǔxìng*) cannot harm one another, thereby dispelling the calamities of the *Five Phases* (*Wǔxíng*).\n\n　　The *Celestial Lord* (*Zhàng*) further instructed: Annotation: *Zhàng* refers to the *Grand Supreme* (*Zǒngzhēn*), and *Zhang* refers to the *Celestial Master* (*Tiānshī*).\n\n　　*\"The human body begins its life from the Five Phases and also perishes through them. I have known this for a long time. Even if one does not understand it early, they will still be harmed by these calamities. All must first practice the *Yú Bù* (Tortoise Steps), tread upon the *Earthly Poles*, and follow the reverse and inverted order of the three ranks. Then, recite the Five-Phase incantations to dispel them, and within one year, the calamities will be dispelled. Annotation: The Five-Phase incantations are found in the first volume of the *Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl* (*Jinsuo Liuzhu*), containing five verses.*\n\n　　First, one performs the *Bundle Facing* (*Shùxiàng*) ritual, drums the *Heavenly Drum* (*Tiāngǔ*) thirty-six times, and invigorates the body as prescribed. Then, one ignites the furnace, raises the *Official* (*Guān*), and sits in reflection upon the *Supreme One’s Hall* (*Tàiyī Fǔ*). Upon completion, one stands and reflects upon the *Officials of the Six Star Lords* (*Liuxingjun*) and their *Soldiers* (*Bīng*), as depicted in the diagram to the left and right. One then dons the *Seven-Star Dipper* (*Qīxīng Dǒu*) robes in a full circle, weeping while donning the robes, and raises the *Official* (*Guān*). After completing the ritual, one ascends the *Step Framework*.\n\n　　Upon finishing the *Step Framework*, one recites the five incantations to break the mutual opposition of the Five Phases. Then, one ascends the *Step Framework* five times again, circling it. After completion, one recites the twelve incantations to subdue the twelve *Branches* (*Zhīgān*) and *Heavenly Stems* (*Tiāngān*), securing *Long Life* and dispelling the Five-Phase calamities. Within one year, one avoids evil; within two years, one avoids harm from weapons; within three years, one avoids harm from spirits. By the fourth year, one becomes an *Earthly Immortal* (*Dìxiān*), and all harm and calamity dare not approach.\n\n　　From this point onward, blessings and joy are boundless. One commands the divine spirits, tames the flying dragon, the *Supreme Ultimate* (*Tàijí*) bestows the *Numinous Herb* (*Shízhī*), and the *Jade Emperor* (*Yùdì*) grants the *Youthful Immortal* (*Tóng*). If practiced for twenty-seven years, one becomes a *High Clarity True Person* (*Shàngqīng Zhēnrén*). Annotation: This explanation states that the *Golden Lock* (*Jinsuo*) method must be practiced first, followed by the *Heavenly Framework* (*Tiāngāng*) and *Flying Steps* (*Fēibù*) method, to achieve the effects as described earlier by the *Celestial Lord* (*Shàngjūn*). If one only practices the *Heavenly Framework*, it may not necessarily dispel evil.\n\n　　This method requires first practicing the *Earthly Poles*, then ascending the *Heavenly Framework*—only then will one have the effects of dispelling evil. If one practices the *Heavenly Framework* without first establishing the *Earthly Poles*, there will be no response from the divine spirits.\n\n　　In the past, the ancient *Broad Achievement Lord* (*Guǎngchéngjūn*) taught the *Yellow Emperor* (*Huángdì*) the *Flying Steps of Heavenly Steel* (*Tiāngāng Fēibù*). The *Yellow Emperor* practiced it for thirty years without divine response. Later, he sought the method again, and the *Celestial Lord* then gave him the first volume of the *Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl* (*Jinsuo Liuzhu*) and explained the *Earthly Poles* method. Within one year, he could summon and subdue spirits to his will. In the second year, he annihilated *Chīyóu* (a mythical tyrant). In the third year, his strength was sufficient to wrestle tigers and leopards. By the twenty-seventh year, he could transform his form and manifest countless wonders. At the twenty-eighth year, he ascended to Heaven.\n\n　　Though the human body is born of Heaven and nurtured by Earth, its foundation is rooted in Earth. If one seeks the *Heavenly Framework* without first establishing the *Earthly Poles* as the root and foundation, it is like building a pavilion without a base—how can it stand firmly in the air? The *Ancient Lords* (*Qiánshèng Hòushèng*) all descended personally to instruct their disciples in practice.\n\n　　Annotation: The master leads the disciple to ascend the framework, transcending the *Five Sufferings* and *Eight Hardships*.\"",

Within a year, such disturbances will cease.\n\n**Note:** If a husband performs this monthly, three times a day, after a year, its power will manifest like a deity’s emergence and disappearance.\n\n**Fourth Star of Mysterious Obscurity** (*Xuánmíng Xīng*)\n**Note:** Form the right hand as **□**, the right elbow as **□**, the right shoulder as **□**, the heart as **□**, the left chest as **□**, the left knee as **□**, the left foot as **□**, and **□** to complete the gesture.\n\nWhen all four limbs are aligned, those born in the *Mao-Yǒu* directions govern it.\n\n**Note:** Its applications are twofold:\n1.

It is the sole star capable of swiftly controlling them, surpassing even water and fire in speed.\n\nThough the stars are used sequentially, the *Step-Star* method retains its prohibitive power. Only the **Heavenly Pass Star** can dominantly subdue ghosts, malevolent figures, military conflicts, official misfortunes, and countless diseases. Its execution is as swift as water and fire.\n\nThe seven stars have various ritual offerings (*jiào*). Know this: offerings must follow the prescribed rites and timing.\n\nIn the spring months of the first and second lunar months, or in autumn during the seventh and eighth lunar months, perform sacrifices according to one’s natal star on clear days.\n\nDo not perform sacrifices at other times, lest misfortune be invited—do not presume to seek blessings recklessly.\n\nAdditionally, for those practicing the *Step-Halo* (*Bùgāng*), sacrifices must be conducted twice yearly in spring and autumn.\n\n**Note:** If one practices the *Step-Halo* or *Memory-Tracing* methods, monthly cultivation is required, with sacrifices performed twice a year. Offerings should include money, wine, fresh rice cakes, fruits, and other ritual foods as specified in the *Líu Zhū Jīng* (Lower Grade).\n\nThis is the later sage-emperor’s revelation to the Celestial Master: the **Northern Dipper** is the **Central Dipper**. The Central Dipper’s nine stars transform into the nine spirits, forming the **Star-Halo** (*Xīnggāng*) through their steps.\n\nYu saw a spirit bird stepping on the Star-Halo, turning stones and wood, and consuming serpents. After three years of learning, his art perfected, he could invert the nine stars, aligning them with his feet—touching objects with his toes made them move, unaware his hands were the true agents.\n\nLater, ascending the peaks of the Shèkè Mountains, a divine person instructed him: *\"Why do you step with your feet when your hands can do it?\"* Yu was then taught to use his toes instead. The king saw the spirit bird stepping with its beak-like toes and bowed in acceptance.\n\nAfterward, he attained the Dao, commanding ghosts, dragons, tigers, and leopards. He dredged rivers, regulated floods, and delineated the Nine Regions.\n\nUpon ascending to imperial rule, he mastered the Dao, interpreted the *Yì*, transformed his form, and ascended to the **Supreme Pole** (*Tàijí*).\n\n**Note:** Though he did not attain the **Upper Clarity True Person**, he governed the lower realm’s water and drought from the **Left Great One’s Domain** (*Zuǒ Tài Yī Fǔ*).\n\nYu received divine instruction:\n\n**Note:** This is the **Mandate of the Celestial Official** passed to Yu.\n\nThe words were: *\"Observe the Northern Dipper—this is the Central Dipper’s **Heavenly Pass Star**.\"*\n\n**Note:** Daoist scriptures state that the **Central Dipper’s Great Arc** oversees all spirits, thus this is the Central Dipper.\n\nThe *Dà Jīn Suǒ Liú Zhū Pǐn* states: *\"Now observe the Northern Dipper—this is the Central Dipper.\"*\n\nFor those facing sudden official persecution, military threats, or illnesses, this method is as swift as water and fire. Its power lies in the heart and hands, resonating with the palm, while the body and spirit also hold governing formulas—these are found in the **Palm Diagram**.\n\nThe **Most High Laozi** declared: *\"The Central Dipper governs the four limbs and the twenty-eight lunar mansions. In one day and night, it completes a celestial circuit. The Northern Dipper is revered, paying homage to the two Great True Stars.\"*\n\nIts third star is named the **True Person Star**, overseeing those in this world who seek true immortality.

In the course of a month, one must practice the **Stepwise Daoist Circuit** five times.\n\n*Note: The Circuit also comprises **Seven Stars**—specifically, excluding the **Assisting Minister Stars** (*Fǔbì*).*\n\nIf the position of the **True Person Star** is unfavorable, one must avoid stepping upon it; instead, one must tread the **Stepwise Daoist Circuit** accordingly. This is known in the world as the **\"Treading the Earth Circuit\"** (*Nièdì Jì*).\n\nThis method requires one to follow the **Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper** (*Běidǒu Qīxīng*), excluding calamities and misfortunes, ascending to transcendence and emerging from mortality. It subjugates malevolent spirits, deities, and demons—such as **Dragon, Tiger, Leopard, and Manticore** (*lónghǔ páo jīng*), **noxious spirits and poisonous serpents** (*yāosuì dúshé*), and the **Great Demons of Heaven and Earth** (*Tiāndì Dàmó*). All must be invoked using the **Northern Dipper**, aligning with the **Five Dipper Lords** (*Wǔ Dǒu Jūn*) by sealing their names.\n\n*Note: The Five Dipper Lords are the seven stars of the Northern Dipper, excluding the **Assisting Minister Stars** (*Fǔbì*).*\n\nThe **Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper** are properly named **Dipper, Ox, Girl, Void, Peril, Hall, and Wall** (*Dǒu, Niú, Nǚ, Xū, Wēi, Shì, Bì*). However, in practice, they are called the **Five Dipper Lords** (*Wǔ Dǒu Jūn*)—that is, the **Luminous Yang** (*Yángmíng*) and **Yin Essence** (*Yīnjīng*), though this is incorrect.\n\n*Note: Because people do not know the true names of the Northern Dipper, they mistakenly call them Luminous Yang and Yin Essence.*\n\nThis is the **Central Dipper** (*Zhōng Dǒu*), which augments one’s lifespan and fulfills merit in the mortal realm, harmonizing with **Daoist Immortals** (*xiān pǐn*) and aligning with the **Northern Dipper**. One must first cultivate the **Northern Dipper**, then proceed to the **Central Dipper**.\n\nIf there are merits or misfortunes, one seeks salvation for others with the same swiftness as water and fire—this is verified.\n\nThe **Later Sage Emperor** (*Hòushèng Jūn*) instructed **Grandmaster of the True** (*Zǒng Zhēn*):\n\n*\"You must convey the **Supreme Daoist Teachings** (*Zhìrén Shàngjiào*) to those who are **Daoist Aspirants** (*zhìrén*).*\n*Note: It is not given to ordinary people.*\n\n*Daoist Aspirants* must cultivate with their hearts and minds, transmitting and practicing the teachings as instructed. Those who do so are then taught this method, entrusted to attain the **True Person** (*Zhēn Rén*) stage of cultivation. Do not let *Daoist Aspirants* lose their merit or diminish their lifespan, for then you would fail in your duty as the **Grandmaster of the True** (*Zǒng Zhēn Rén*).\n\nI command you to pass this on to all, and you must teach it to all *Daoist Aspirants*. Cultivation cannot surpass this.\n\n*Note: After transmitting the *Gold Lock Flowing Pearl Canon* (*Jīnsuǒ Liúzhū Zhèngjīng*), one concludes with a **ritual exorcism** (*jiào*). Then, this method is practiced.*\n\nEvery night, after completing the ritual exorcism, one must\n*Note: The invocation of fate is without urgency, aligning the names of the Seven Stars with the Five Dipper Lords.*\n\nseal the name of the Dipper Lord when the **Northern Dipper** (*Běidǒu*) is upright. The **Five Dipper Lords** (*Wǔ Dǒu Jūn*)—such as **□, □, □, □, □, □, □**—rotate in celestial vigilance, protecting mortals and allowing them to attain their own **True Essence** (*Zhēn*).\n\nCultivation must always be like the **\"Embodied Stars Diagram\"** (*Hán Yǐng Tú*). Those who seal the positions are entrusted to command the *Daoist Aspirants*.\n\n*Note: Daoist Aspirants do not use the Seven Stars to cover their bodies like clothing; rather, they visualize them within the mind without causing harm to the vital essence or diminishing one’s lifespan. By day, they remain in a tranquil state, practicing the Seven Stars Diagram to ensure their souls and spirits ascend with their bodies. Their bodily essence remains steadfast and undispersed, with the Seven Stars radiating brilliance. Ghosts and spirits fear this, and the cultivation resembles the \"Embodied Stars\" and the \"Embodied Grand Dao\" (Hán Hóng). Their Dao is inherently true, revered and guarded by Heaven and Earth, with spirits and demons submitting to their command. The Heavenly Demons welcome them, and the Three Officials (of Heaven, Earth, and Man) report their merit. When their merit is complete, they ascend to transcendence by day, becoming True Persons (Zhēn Rén). In all actions—standing, sitting, resting, or sleeping—they must not depart from their bodies.*\n\n*Note: Daoist Aspirants who constantly visualize the Seven Stars, day and night, without pause, will have their bodily essence shine like stars after a year. Their forms will embody the True Essence.*\n\n*Note: After a year of uninterrupted practice—standing, sitting, resting, or sleeping—while constantly visualizing the sealed Seven Stars, the stars’ essence enters deeply into the body, circulating in a perpetual Daoist Circuit, akin to the rotation of Heaven. Thus, it is named the \"Embodied Stars Daoist Essence Circuit\" (Hánxīng Zhēn Qīwéi Xīng Zhēn), also known as the \"Ascension to the Upper Clarity\" (Rù Shàngqīng), enabling one to repel armies.*\n\nAfter two years, they attain the **\"Embodied True Essence\"** (*Hán Zhēn*).\n\n*Note: For a year, in all actions—standing, sitting, resting, or sleeping—one must constantly strike the teeth and practice the formulas, which are found in the Palm Diagram. These are named the **Three Supreme Formulas** (Dōujīān, Dōushī, Dàdào). By constantly visualizing the Seven Stars, the Three Officials (of Heaven, Earth, and Man) fear the Seven Stars and dare not linger. They also do not allow the **Three Inches of Vital Essence** (*Sān Cùn*) to determine the Daoist Aspirants’ merits or demerits, virtues or faults. Instead, they report these directly to the Heavenly Emperor. Thus, the Nine Assemblies (of the underworld) have no records, and one’s fate is determined by their merits and demerits, either ascending to Daoist Immortality or being removed from the register of death. There is no killing or injury, no resentment or opposition. Their bodies tread the Daoist Circuit of Heaven and the Earthly Memorial, free from disease and death, firm and unyielding. Their spirits are controlled, their souls are stabilized, and their True Essence is not lost, so it is called the \"Stabilized True Essence\" (Dìng Zhēn).*\n\nAfter three years, they attain the **\"Earthly True Essence\"** (*Dì Zhēn*).\n\n*Note: Daoist Aspirants cultivate the Earthly Memorial (Dì Jì) while also practicing the Heavenly Circuit (Tiān Gāng), never ceasing in their standing, sitting, resting, or sleeping. They combine this with the service of the **Sacred Talismans** (*Líng Fú*), **Six Celestial Stems** (*Liù Jiǎ*), and **Three Sovereigns** (*Sān Huáng*). Such practitioners attain the True Essence within humanity, hence the name \"Earthly True Essence\" (Dì Xiān Zhēn).*\n\n*Note: As the scriptures describe the Earthly Immortals (Dì Xiān), they only practice the Heavenly Circuit (Tiān Gāng) or solely tread the Earthly Memorial (Dì Jì) to attain the rank of Earthly Immortals. Ghosts, spirits, and malevolent demons cannot harm their bodies. Even their families, plagued by evil spirits and demons, are protected. How much more so can they safeguard others with their talismanic power! In lands of calamity and evil, they become beacons of fortune and virtue. In homes of disaster and misfortune, they transform them into abodes of joy and prosperity. Once their divine power is attained, they must not act recklessly. They should emulate the loyalty and virtue of the **Supreme Sage** (Tàishàng), the **Later Sage Emperor** (Hòushèng Jūn), and the **Second Later Sage Emperor** (Èr Hòushèng Jūn).*」",

The Female Star requires the right foot to step forward first.\n\nNext is the Void, then Danger, then Room, and finally the Wall Star.

Humans, gods, dragons, spirits, ghosts, insects, beasts, venomous serpents, and all monstrous things—all submit and are not slain. Those that resist are destroyed.\n\nIts principle involves combining five Dipper steps into three steps of nine traces, or thirty-five traces. The Great Yu’s Step consists of fifteen traces. These two grades of Yu’s Step are the inner secrets for averting disasters, escaping calamities, and entering the Dao of immortality.\n*Note:* Daoists know only of the *Flying Heavenly Gāng* technique but are unaware of the *Earthly Ji* and Yu’s Step. Using only the *Two-Sevens* method for two years without attaining divinity, they criticize it as unspiritual and unholy—a false claim against the scriptures of immortality.\n\nMoreover, the Later Sage Lord clearly revised and demonstrated the *Three-Five Golden Lock Flowing Pearl* text. The three—*One* (元), *Three Steps*, and *Gāng*—contain the secrets. At the moment of stepping, the Five-Colored Silk binds the secrets, held within the palm.\n\nIf seeking longevity, pinch the *Sìmìng* (司命) and *Three Officials* targets.

The entire work consists of seventy-eight scrolls, detailing step-alignment, Dipper-treading, talisman-holding, incantations, summoning gods and ghosts, fasting and ritual rites, executing calamities, and dispelling illnesses. It synthesizes the techniques of the Celestial Master and Upper Clarity schools into one system, serving as a crucial document for studying pre-Northern Song Daoist practices.\n\n---\n**Preface to the *Tàishàng Sānwǔ Tàixuān Jīnzhù Liúzhū* (太玄金箓金锁流珠引序)**\n**Sequence by the Daoist Immortal Li Chunfeng**\n\nThe *Tàishàng Sānwǔ Tàixuān Jīnzhù* is the transmission from the **Primordial Beginning Heavenly Venerable** to the **Tàishàng Dàdào Jun** (太上大道君), also called the **Highest Holy Tàishàng Yùchén Xuánhuáng Dàdào Jun** (玉晨玄皇大道君).\n*Note:* A manifestation of the Primordial Beginning, or said to be a disciple of the Heavenly Venerable, ruling over all Dao.\n\nThe **Dàdào Jun** transmitted to the **Zǐqīng Tàisù Gāoxū Dòngyào Sānyuān Shàngdào Jun** (紫清太素高虚洞曜三元上道君), who transmitted to the **Zǐchén Tàiwéi Tiāndì Dàodào Jun** (紫晨太微天帝道君).\n*Note:* Also called the *Upper Clarity Most True Dao Venerable*, ruling over the Thirty-Six Heavens.\n\nThe **Dàodào Jun** transmitted to the **Zǐmíng Tàiwéi Jiǔdào Gāoyuán Yùchén Dàodào Jun** (紫明太微九道高元玉晨道君), who then transmitted to the **Tàishàng Lǎojūn**.\n*Note:* Some say Tàishàng Lǎojūn was a disciple of Tàishàng Dàodào Jun, not a teacher of Tiāndì. It should be the transmission to the *Tàipíng Jīnquè Dìchén Hòushèng Xuányuān Shàngdào Jun* (太平金阙帝晨后圣玄元上道君). This is also a manifestation of Tàishàng Lǎojūn, hence the name *Laozi* (老子) as a reincarnation, teaching the *Flowing Pearl Layered Years* method.\n\nUnder **Tiāndì Jun**, the **Yùchén Dàodào Jun** transmitted to the **Zǐyuán Tàiwéi Bāsù Sānyuān Xuánchén Yuánjūn** (紫元太微八素三元玄晨元君), who transmitted to the **Zǐwēi Yuánlíng Guītái Jiǔlíng Tàizhēn Yuánjūn** (紫微元灵龟台九灵太真元君).\n*Note:* This ruler instructs those in the world who study the True Dao.\n\nThe **Yuánjūn** transmitted to the **Dàlíng Shàngxiāo Féichén Zhōngyáng Huánglǎo Jun** (大灵上霄飞晨中央黄老君), who transmitted to the **Tàiyuán Dōngxiá Bósāng Dānlín Dàdì Shàngdào Jun** (太元东霞搏桑丹林大帝上道君). This Jun resided in Bósāng and transmitted to the Twenty-Four True Ones. The transmission was lost in Central Plains.\n\nThe **Zǐchén Tàiwéi Tiāndì Dàodào Jun** transmitted to the **Shàngqīng Tàipíng Jīnquè Dìchén Hòushèng Xuányuān Yùhuáng Shàngdào Jun** (上清太平金阙帝晨后圣玄元玉皇上道君).\n*Note:* Also called the *Great Dao Venerable of the Jade Emperor*.\n\nThis Jun governs the lower Ten Heavens, oversees the fate of all beings, and communicates with the Upper Clarity. As the Later Sage Lord, the **Forefather Tàishàng Dàodào Jun** was called the *Empty Sovereign* (虚皇), ruling all Dao. The **Later Sage Tàishàng Lǎojūn** was called the *Jade Sovereign* (玉皇), ruling all Dao.\n\nSince the establishment of the **Jīnquè Emperor**, officials and ministers were fully appointed, mirroring the hierarchical duties of mortal rulers. Each has its domain, encompassing the Nine Wilds and all Heavens.\n\nThe Jun’s surname is **Li**, given name **Dān**, and courtesy name **Bóyáng**. He renamed the *Golden Lock* as the *Tàixuān Sānwǔ Jīnsuǒ Liúzhū Jīngzhù*, formally expounding the essentials of the Dipper Step and Gāng alignment.\n\nThe *Jīngzhù* consists of eighty-six chapters and forty-three volumes. Presented to the **Tàishàng Lǎojūn**, also called the **Highest Holy Tàishàng Yùchén Xuánhuáng Dàdào Jun**, who then transmitted it to mortals as the true sovereign and true ministers, wishing to save the Ten Heavens.\n*Note:* The Nine Wilds, including the lower celestial realms, are called the Ten Heavens. The world is the Upper Heavenly Daoist Capital, the *Jade Emperor’s Divine Sovereign*.\n\nHe compiled a concise fifteen-volume core scripture, along with manuals and diagrams on palm-secrets, discussing the alignment of steps and the treading of *Ji*. Collectively, these are titled the *Golden Lock Great Name*, followed by *Flowing Pearl*, *Flying Step Heavenly Gāng*, and finally *Yu’s Step Earthly Ji*.",

The **Posterior Sage Jade Emperor** then bestowed upon **Mystic Territory**—*Note:* also written as **Mystic State**—the **Twenty-Nine True Persons**.\n\n*Note:* These **True Persons** are responsible for petitioning the names of **Daoists** to the heavens. If one’s merit does not meet the standards after three trials, they are first petitioned to the **Posterior Sage Jade Emperor**, who may then grant **Daoist** titles and ranks based on their merit. These **True Persons** oversee the nine realms and myriad lands of the lower world, commanding mountains and waters, and are known by the names of mortals. The **Little Attendant** governs **Qín, Chǔ, and the Southern Seas**; the **Great Attendant** governs **Yān and Qí**; the **Western Spirit Attendant** governs **Sòng, Wèi, Zhèng, and Liáng**.

They maintain incense and lamps continuously, healing others’ afflictions. If they encounter the **Six Auspicious Talismans** and practice them over many years, they may even attain **immortality**, becoming **Daoists** among mortals. Further cultivation may lead them to meet a **Daoist Master**, who then grants them this **Scripture and Diagram**, allowing them to practice the **Flying Steps Technique** and thus become **True Persons** and **Daoist Immortals**.\n\nThe second rank are those who refine **gold and stone elixirs**, using them as medicines of ultimate **Daoist** attainment to heal others’ illnesses, strengthen their bodies, and regulate their **organs and meridians**—*Note:* **藏** here refers to **organs and meridians**.—They take these elixirs in secluded mountain forests and thus live far beyond the **Ten Thousand Years**, dying not before a hundred years. Even after death, they do not become lower ghosts but are reborn, receiving their original blessings.\n\nThe third rank are those who sincerely aspire to the **Dao/Way**, following a **Clear Master** without hesitation, even traveling ten thousand miles. They offer their **heart** and exert their **virtue/power** without sparing effort or labor. Over long years and months, the **Master** will naturally record their **virtue/power** and merit, then teach them this **Scripture**, transmitting it afterward. Those who sincerely cultivate will reap **virtue/power** from their **Master** first and be petitioned to the **Posterior Sage**. Many are then granted **Daoist** titles and ranks, becoming **True Persons**.\n\nThese three categories were taught by the **Posterior Sage Master**—*Note:* **Zhang the Daoist Master**—and the **Supreme True Lord of the Golden Dipper**. The **Posterior Sage Master** also instructed the **Purple-Mysteries Left Consort**—*Note:* For those who teach and guide disciples to become **True Persons**, after three successful trials, they are first petitioned to the **Golden Dipper**, granted **Daoist** titles, and conferred as **True Persons**.\n\nThe **Posterior Sage Master** further descended to instruct the **Twenty-Four True Persons**, who ascended to the heavens as **Twenty-Four Supreme True Lords of the Left and Right Golden Dippers**. *Note:* These **True Persons** oversee the affairs of all the heavens and earth, the living populace, and determine the merit of those who attain **True Persons** rank, as well as the depth of their cultivation over years and months, petitioning their degrees and commendations.\n\nThe **Posterior Sage Master** also appointed the **Supreme True Lord** to oversee trials and conferred upon **Máo Yíng** and **Lǐ Zhòngfǔ**—*Note:* **Máo** and **Lǐ** are **Daoist Masters**—and others as **Lords of Fate**. *Note:* They lead and instruct those who follow the **Dao/Way** to become **True Persons**, testing them.

It spoke of **fortifying the body like gold** and **retaining the spirit like a lock**.\n*(Note: Another version says, \"Retaining the spirit as a lock, hence *Golden Lock*.\" This was from the old *Golden Talisman* teachings.)*\n\nWhen reciting aloud the *Golden Lock*,\n*(Note: The name *Golden Lock* signifies the inherent principle of the self, aiding the realm to save others.)*\nand when walking in *Golden Halter steps*,\n*(Note: Stepping the Heavenly Halter, treading the Earthly Measures.)*\nthese two terms were bestowed upon later worthies, clarifying their names so that practitioners might attain the **Dao** in their time.\n\n**Wáng Jun** asked again: *\"Why is it called *Flowing Pearl*?\"*\n\n**Yǐn Jun** replied: *\"The *Flowing Pearl* refers to the **Nine Stars of the Northern Dipper**.*\n*(Note: Though seven stars are visible, two are unseen, totaling nine.)*\nPractitioners, through their cultivation and stepping the Halter, are said to *flow and turn like pearls*.*\n*(Note: The nightly rotation of the Dipper encircles the heavens endlessly, like unceasing flowing water, and the stars resemble pearls, hence *Flowing Pearl*.)*\nOriginally, this was called the *Golden Talisman’s Method*.\n*(Note: The old *Golden Talisman* text states, \"The Method locks the spirit.\" These four characters were its opening.)*\nThe **Posterior Sage Emperor** renamed the *Method* as *Flowing Pearl*, which is now the *Seven-Star Flying Step*, paired with the *Nine-Dipper Robe*, used to subdue evil and rectify inversions.\n\nThe **Supreme Venerable Yǐn True Person** transmitted the four characters *Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl* to the **Posterior Sage Emperor**, pointing to the **Three Pure Ones**—\n*(Note: The **Jade Pure, Highest Pure, and Supreme Pure**.)*\n—the **Celestial Master** composed the *Three Pure Ones’ Sequence*, **Yǐn True Person** wrote the *Three Pure Ones’ Words*, and **Wáng Jun** sang the *Three Pure Ones’ Song*.\n*(Note: All speak of deriving *One* to attain *Three*, *Three* to attain *Five*, *Five* to attain *Seven*, and *Seven* to attain *Nine*—this refers to the three celestial yang numbers, culminating at *Nine*.)*\n\nThe **Supreme One** above is **Taiyi**,\n*(Note: The One Heaven.)*\nwhile the **Two Principles** below encompass **Earth**.\n*(Note: Earth.)*\nThe **Two Principles** generate the **Four Symbols**, the **Four** generate the **Six**, the **Six** generate the **Eight**, and the **Eight** generate the **Ten**.\n*(Note: All originate from the **Dao** and represent the extreme yin numbers.)*\n\nThe **Emperor of Jade Pure** is the **Void Emperor, Great Dao Lord**.\n*(Note: The title of **Primordial**.)*\nThe **Middle Emperor of Jade Pure** is the **High Emperor, Supreme Dao Lord**.\n*(Note: The title of **Supreme Dao Lord**.)*\nThe **High Emperor** above is the **Supreme Dao Lord**.\n*(Note: The **Supreme Dao Lord**.)*\nThe **Highest Pure** above and the **Jade Pure** below is the **Jade Emperor**.\n*(Note: **Supreme Venerable Laozi**.)*\nIt is also said: The **Posterior Sage’s Peaceful Emperor**.\nThe **Supreme Pure** above and the **Highest Pure** below is the **Heavenly Emperor, Taiyi Venerable Sovereign**.\n*(Note: The **Taiyi Dao Lord**.)*\nIt is also said: **Taiyi, the Master of Heaven**, the **Supreme Extremity’s Venerable Sovereign**, called **Heaven**, the **Dao’s Son**.\n\nThose who study the **Dao** must know the **Three Pure Ones’ true sovereigns** to learn from the **Posterior Sage Emperor**, the current **Highest Pure’s sovereign**. The **Supreme Pure’s Taiyi Lord**—\n*(Note: The **Heavenly Sovereign**.)*\n—is the sovereign.\n\nAll petitions must first pass through the **Supreme Pure**, enter the **Highest Pure**, and then be registered with the **Daoist name**.\n*(Note: Also, first register in the **Supreme Pure**, then proceed to the **Highest Pure**, submitting the **Golden Seal**.)*\n\nThe **Posterior Sage Emperor** instructed the **True Persons**: *\"To seek the **True Dao**, one must first practice the **Yǔ Step**, which is the **Heavenly Halter**.*\n*(Note: *Yǔ* means *garment*. Originally the character for *feather*. This is the correct pronunciation. Because **Yǔ** of the Xia Dynasty mastered water control, he encountered this **Heavenly Halter Step Method**. After four years of cultivation, he attained the **Dao**, commanding dragons, tigers, and spirits to dredge rivers and regulate the waters, earning merit. Later, he became a **Sage and True Person**, and his name was changed to *Yǔ*. After fulfilling his earthly merit, thirty years later, he ascended in flesh. **Yǔ** is now the **Supreme Extremity True Person**, whom the ministers occasionally see. His sister also departed. His robes and cap were buried at **Kuàijī Mountain**, where a temple remains in his honor.

The **Underworld** will not register them, and the **Celestial Bureaus** will have no record of them.\n*(Note: Though humans are born of Heaven, they are nurtured by Earth. Life and death are decreed by Heaven, but merit and vice depend on Earth. The enlightened of Earth must first be subdued.)*",

      "translated_text": "「Thus, the **Heavenly Halter** is mastered by subduing the **Earthly Halter**, and the **Yǔ Step** is achieved by following the **Heavenly Halter’s Method**. The spirit and vitality are thereby tamed.\n\nThose who do not know this Dao cannot pay homage to the **Three Pure Ones**. The original *Sutra of the Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl*—which originates from **Great Dao Lord of Jade Purity**—was initially named *The Inner Canon of Golden Talisman and Jade Talisman*.\n*(Note: The Celestial Sovereign named it *The Golden Talisman and Jade Talisman*.)*\n\nLater sages renamed it *The Golden Lock Sutra* and *The Flowing Pearl Sutra*, thus passing it down. This is the second scroll of *The Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl*.\n\nThe **Great Sovereign of Total Perfection, Zhāng Dàolíng, Zhào Shēng, Wáng Cháng, Lǐ Zhòngfǔ, Máo Yíng, Xǔ Yùfǔ**, and others are successive authors who compiled it. **Li Chūnfēng**, the Daoist sage, annotated it.\n\n**The Diagram of Three Steps and Nine Traces**\nThis diagram was taught by **Laozi** to **Yǔ**; it depicts the **Yǔ Step** of three steps and nine traces.\n*(Note: **Yǔ** first tamed the **Earthly Halter**, completing the three matters of **advancing, retreating, and reversing**, then proceeded with the two feet.)*\n\nWhether the **Yǔ Step** is large or small, the two matters (advancing and retreating) are unnecessary if one wishes to **ascend to the Pole Star**. Simply follow the diagram’s prescribed method.\n\nThe **Yǔ Step** (right and left) is used to seek longevity and avert calamities. Later sages instructed the **Celestial Master**, initially teaching the **Heavenly Halter’s Method**, then refining it into the **Nine Traces**. This also aligns with **Pole Star numerology**.\n\nThe three matters of **advancing, retreating, and reversing** are completed in three rounds.\n*(Note: Three rounds of the **Heavenly Halter** are inferior to the **Three Halters and Three Degrees**—the **Yǔ Step** must be performed right and left in three rounds.)*\n\nIf one desires swift results and effective practice, they should perform three steps of the **Heavenly Halter’s Method**, advancing and retreating once each. Boys advance left, girls advance right.\n*(Note: After completing right and left, one more round must be done—totaling three.)*\n\nThis is the successive **advancing, retreating, and reversing** in three rounds.\n\nIf one wishes to **subdue malevolence and deploy martial methods**, or fears calamities, they should practice the **Yǔ Step of the Twenty-Eight Constellations**.\n\nAfter completing the **Heavenly Halter** in one hundred steps, within thirty-five days, its efficacy may be tested by **water and fire**.\n*(Note: According to **Laozi’s** initial instruction to **Yǔ**, the **Pole Star Method** was perfected later, and only the **Yǔ Step** remains. The **Twenty-Eight Constellations** were later taught to **Wáng Jūn**.)\n\nBegin with the **Northern Pole**, then proceed to the **Eastern Pole**, the **Southern Pole**, and the **Western Pole**, finally ascending to the **Central Pole** without stepping on the **True Person Star**.\n\nTreading the **Northern Pole** seeks the **Law of the Pole**, reciting the **Deciphering of Jiazi**. The **Eastern Pole** recites the **Deciphering of Jia-yin**, the **Southern Pole** the **Deciphering of Jia-wu**, the **Western Pole** the **Deciphering of Jia-shēn**, and the **Central Pole** the **Decipherings of Jia-xū and Jia-chén**. These are the **Pole Star Decipherings** corresponding to their directions.\n\nFor longevity practice, mark the **Deciphering of the Life Officer** with red ink, or bind it with five-colored silk threads, then perform the **Heavenly Halter**. After three years, one attains **Earthly True Personhood**, reaching the point where the **Life Officer** descends to remove one’s name from the **Register of the Dead**.\n*(Note: Those born under Jiazi and similar **Metal** signs use **Ding-sì (丙午、丁巳)** as the **Life Officer**. Wood-born individuals use **Gēng-shēn and Xīn-xǔ (庚申、辛酉)**; water-born use **Wù-chén and Jǐ-wèi (戊辰、己未)**; fire-born use **Rén-zǐ and Guǐ-hài (壬子、癸亥)**; earth-born use **Jiā-yín and Yǐ-mǎo (甲寅、乙卯)**. These are used in practice.)*\n\nIn all three grades of this **Heavenly Halter** practice, one must recite the **Nine Post-Step Invocations** afterward.\n*(Note: After the invocation, retain the **Twenty-Eight Constellations** in the body as per the diagram. The diagram is found in *The Third Central Element Diagram of the Golden Lock*.)*\n\nThe **Twelve Post-Step Invocations** are incorporated into the three pre-existing ones, and their names must also be recited.\n\nFirst, after one step and one round, invoke:\n*\"In days of old, I received instruction from the **Mysterious Sage**,\nwho taught me the **Heavenly Halter’s Method**—\nall my requests are fulfilled.\nThus it is spoken.\"*\n\nAfter one round of the **Heavenly Halter**, *(Note: Invoke while stepping on the **Pole Star**.)*\ninvoke:\n*\"The **Five Phases** mutually generate.\nThus it is spoken.\"*\n\nAfter two rounds of the **Heavenly Halter**, *(Note: Invoke after two rounds of the **Pole Star**.)*\ninvoke:\n*\"The **Five Phases** mutually generate.\nThus it is spoken.\"*\n\nThen recite the **Heavenly Key Deciphering**, briefly.\n\nFourth, three steps toward **Kui**, one round of the **Earthly Halter**. *(Note: Three rounds of stepping, performed in reverse.)*\nInvoke:\n*\"In days of old, I received instruction from the **Mysterious Sage**,\nwho taught me to tread the **Earthly Halter** and master the **Heavenly Halter**.\nThus it is spoken.\"*\n\nRecite the **Decipherings of the Grand Prohibition and Grand Sage**.\n\nFifth, three steps toward **Kui**, one round of the **Earthly Halter**. *(Note: In the third round of stepping, advance from the **seventh star** toward **Kui Star**.)*\nInvoke:\n*\"The **Three Five** form the **Weft**,\nwithin which the **Thread** is named **Qi**.\nThus it is spoken.\"*\n\n*(Note: **Disaster points**—for **Metal-born**, disaster lies in **Fire**.)*\n\nSixth, one round toward **Kui**, piercing and subduing malevolence, **souls and ghosts**. The calamities of the **Five Phases** will return to strike the one who summoned them.\n*(Note: **Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth**—**Metal** always fears **Fire** as **ghost**, hence the **Heavenly Halter** subdues **Fire** and seeks **Earth** as the remedy, turning misfortune into fortune.)*\n\nInvoke using the **Five Phases Invocation**:\n*\"The **Five Phases** mutually generate;\nthe **Heavenly Halter** holds supreme authority.\nThus it is spoken.\"*\n\nRecite the **Ghost Deciphering**.\n*(Note: After the invocation, add *\"Today, I tread **Kui**—all matters are auspicious.\"* The piercing follows the diagram: **soul above, ghost below**.)*\n\n*(Note: This is the **subduing of malevolence**; do not practice recklessly. If practicing for longevity, perform it as **Three Elements**.)*\n*(Note: **Heaven, Earth, Water**. The **Five Phases** below are **Wood, Metal, Water, Fire, Earth**—those that harm my body must be countered through the **Heavenly Halter** and **Earthly Halter**.)*\n\n*(Note: Even if calamities manifest in sound alone without physical form, one can endure them and attain eternal longevity.)*\n\nThe remaining invocations and piercings are all explained similarly.\n\nFor the **left foot**, step on the **□ Star** to pierce **ghosts**; the **left foot** again advances in **Ding** sequence, retaining the posture as if seated toward the **□ Star**, advancing to the **□** to pierce malevolence.\n*(Note: Recite the **Ghost and Malevolence Deciphering** and the **Force Support Deciphering**.

The **Heavenly and Human Beings** practice the **middle grade**, while the **Immortal Ones of the World** cultivate the **lower grade**. Thus, through the **Three Officials' Dao-scriptures**, one ascends from **lower-grade True Immortals** to **middle-grade Daoists**, then to **upper-grade Heavenly Immortals**.\n\nThe common folk dwell in the **lower realm**, so they first receive the **lower-grade Dao-scriptures** of True Immortals, and their cultivation progresses toward the middle and upper grades. This book completes the **upper extreme** of the upper grade, the **middle extreme** of the middle grade, and the **lower extreme** of the lower grade, and is titled *The Inner Canon of Taiyi’s Three-Five Golden Dao-scriptures and Jade Dao-scriptures*.\n\n**Note:** Later sages revised this to the **Zhengyi Dao-scriptures**, naming it *The Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl*.\n\nLater sages, when transmitting the **Zhengyi True Person**, **Note:** This refers to **Zhang the Dao-Master**, titled **Zhengyi True Person**.

Three **Great Generals’ Dao-scriptures** are placed, leading **1,360 stages** of Dao-scriptures.\n**Note:** **224 stages** are transmitted to the **lower Earthly Caverns**, with **120 stages** manifesting in the world. Those in the world who attain these will all hold **heavenly and immortal official ranks**, becoming **eternally living True Persons**. If they lack or fall short, they will not attain eternal life.\n\nThe **Middle Official** oversees humanity, also with three **Great Generals**, leading **1,000 stages** of Dao-scriptures.\n**Note:** **560 stages** are transmitted to the **lower Earthly Caverns**, with **248 stages** manifesting among humanity. Those in the world who attain these will all hold **True Official ranks**. If they lack or fall short for long, they will not be **transmitted into the world**.\n\nThe **Lower Official** oversees Earth and Water, also with three **Great Generals**, leading **1,152 stages** of Dao-scriptures.\n**Note:** **872 stages**. Transmitted to the **lower Earthly Caverns**, with **550 stages** manifesting among humanity. Those in the world who attain these will all hold **Earthly Immortal ranks**. If they lack or fall short, they will not attain **prolonged lifespan** or **transformation into noble families**.\n\nThese are divided into the **Three Officials’ section**, with the **Three Officials’ Generals** guarding internally, **nurturing the body and saving lives**. The **Three Officials** oversee externally, **expelling demons and commanding spirits**, **restraining and guiding people**. All are under the authority of the **Three Officials and Five Stars**, all kept secret in the **upper heavens**.\n\nThe **Zhengyi Dao-scriptures** total **3,624 stages**. Those in the lower realm who know of their existence may also enter the ranks of **eternally living persons**. How much more so for those who receive transmission and retain or manifest the stages in the world, who become **Daoists**. Beyond ten years of practice, they ascend in broad daylight to the **True Heaven**.\n\nLater sages again declare: Those in the world who practice and attain the **upper-grade stages** hold **Heavenly Immortal ranks**, those who attain the **middle-grade stages** hold **Immortal ranks among humanity**, and those who attain the **lower-grade stages** hold **Earthly Immortal ranks**. Those who attain all three grades will hold **Heavenly Immortal official ranks**, the **True Person’s station**, and upon fulfilling their merit, ascend in broad daylight.\n\nIf one encounters a **non-Daoist**, whatever is seen or heard must be answered with **falsehoods**—but one must **not speak**, only respond with other words.

Hence the scripture states: *\"The Dao generates the One.\"*\n\nThe name **Zhengyi** encompasses the **Three-Five** divisions. **Note:** The **Upper Division** is the **Upper Clarity** (Taiqing); the **Middle Division** is the **Middle Clarity** (Zhongyuan); the **Lower Division** is the **Lower Clarity** (Xianyuan), following the **Five Adaptations**. The **Upper Division** speaks of **Upper Clarity**, the **Middle Division** of **Zhengyi**, **Note:** *Zhengyi* addresses matters of the **human body**, hence it is placed in the **Middle Clarity** of the **Middle Division**. The *Lingbao Wufu* and *Wuyue Zhenxing Tu* discuss the **laws of the Earthly realm**, thus they belong to the **Lower Clarity** of the **Lower Division**.\n\nThe **Lower Division** speaks of the **Five Laws**. At the time when the **Later Sage** transmitted his teachings, there were **three divisions** entrusted to **Grandmaster Fang Ping**, numbered **256**, called the **Three Clarities** (*Sanyuan*), and the **Three Clarities Ritual** (*Sanyuan zhai*) was established. **Note:** *This transmission occurred on the fifteenth day of the first month of the fourth year of King Zhao of Qin’s reign.*\n\nThe **Master of the Reed** (Maojun) rejoiced at this time, and together with **70 volumes**, ascended as an **Immortal**—the **Grandmaster** became a **True Person** (*Zhenren*) alone. The teachings were divided into the **Three Clarities Dao-scriptures**, **Note:** *The 'laws' (*fa*) refer to scriptures, without the historical records of Generals Shishi and Bingjun or the names of gods and Immortals. The 'Dao-scriptures' (*lu*) are the Heavenly Talismans, inscribed with Heaven’s writings, commanding Heaven’s spirits; the talismans are written in bold, crimson script, their forms vivid and striking. Above, they rectify Heaven; in the middle, they rectify humans and subdue spirits; below, they constrain and govern the *qi* of earthly waters, dragons, ghosts, and rebellious demons, compelling them to return to the **True Dao**.*—thus named **Heaven, Earth, and Human**.\n\nThe **Upper Clarity** constrains Heaven, transmitting **Upper Clarity Dao-scriptures**. **Note:** *The Upper Clarity scriptures, laws, and Dao-scriptures all belong to the Upper Clarity division, with 360 stages of form and shadow.*\n\nThe **Middle Clarity** subdues spirits and aids humans, extending to **healing diseases and assisting the nation**.\n\nThe **Lower Clarity** governs the **Earthly Waters Dao-scriptures**, commanding the *qi* of earthly waters, gods, ghosts, and rebellious demons, using them to **protect people and repel calamities**—this is the application of the **Lower Clarity laws**.\n\nThe **Later Sage** declared: The **Upper Clarity laws** are overseen by the **Heavenly Officials**, the **Middle Clarity laws** by the **Human Body Middle Immortal Spirit Officials**, and the **Lower Clarity laws** by the **Earthly Waters Middle Immortal Spirit Officials**. Each has its **commanding generals and soldiers**, to constrain the spirits and gods of the **Three Clarities**, ensuring they do not harm **humans and Heaven**. Thus, the **Supreme Sage** established the **Three-Five Dao-scriptures and diagrams** of **Zhengyi**.\n\n**Note:** *Zhengyi means rectifying the heart and taking the Dao, without any duality or deviation, hence the name Zhengyi.*\n\nThe **Later Sage**, seeing that the **great Dao’s gateways** were becoming numerous, feared that later disciples might be confused in their **initial resolve**, and lose their **true nature**. Thus, he petitioned the **Supreme Dao/Way Lord** before him, requesting a change of the names of the **Golden Dao-scriptures** and **Jade Dao-scriptures**, to instruct the **lower realms’ people**—those who **unified their hearts in reverence and faith**, entering a **single gateway** for **precise cultivation**, would then **attain the Dao** and be named **Zhengyi**.\n\nThis law is **one-way in rectifying the heart**, seeking **cultivation of the utmost truth**, not through **deviant perceptions** that confuse the resolve, but by **meritorious deeds** to attain the Dao. It is **not about abandoning wives and children**, nor **refraining from grains and dwelling in mountains**, nor **abandoning office and secluding oneself**—only later does one **ascend the Dao**.\n\nThe **Later Sage** served as **Prime Minister three times**, and for **750 years** under the **Yin and Zhou dynasties**, attending to **64 Heavenly Sovereigns**, before ascending as the **Supreme Clarity Emperor of the Golden Gate** and **Later Sage Lord of Jade Sovereignty**, **Upper Dao Lord** (*Xuan Yuan Yu Huang Shang Dao Jun*).

      "translated_text": "The **Initial Reception of the Upper Clarity Dao** proceeds thus:\n\nThe **Venerable Lord Lao** speaks:\n*\"The Upper Clarity Dao is the supreme, most exalted, most true, and most sacred Dao of the **Great Dao Lord of Inner Jade Talismans and Golden Talismans** within the **Uppermost Clarity**. It governs the **Uppermost Clarity’s Supreme Lords, Ancestral Masters of the Dao, Celestial Emperors, Great Gods, True Officials of the Upper Immortals, High Spirit Generals, Soldiers, and Clerks**—countless billions of hosts—all as **commanders under the Upper Clarity’s scriptures, laws, and talismans**.*\n\nAt the time of **initial reception**, one must **fast and purify oneself for seven days**, solemnly pledging allegiance to **Heaven, Earth, the Sun, Moon, and Starry Hosts**. Upon completion, one must **seek another Daoist** to **report to one’s sponsoring master**, requesting that they **guard one’s body and mind**, **preserve one’s upright resolve**, and **devoutly emulate the Great Dao**, even if it means **traveling ten thousand *li* to seek a teacher**—\n*Note: If the teacher is nearby, one may simply say, ‘I carry my satchel to seek a teacher.’*\n\nOne humbly beseeches the **Venerable Teacher** to **mercifully accept and guide** this disciple, stating:\n‘I now enter beneath the **door of the Venerable Teacher**, to receive the **Upper Clarity Jade Talismans**—thus and so.’\n\nThrough **twenty-four stages** or **thirty-six stages**, one may receive the **favor of transmission**. Should one **betray this oath**, the **Seven Ancestors** will bear witness.\n\nShould one **disrespect the teacher or betray the Dao**, one’s life will be forfeit to the **Three Officials**, with no regret in death.\n\nThis is my **solemn declaration**; I dare not presume further. I bow twice.\n*Note: If permitted, one must then, in the **Transmission Rites**, formally submit these words and follow the teacher’s instructions as broken down. If unable to discern something, one must **bow and request clarification**, stating, ‘This matter is beyond my understanding.’ If the teacher grants it, one must **establish an altar for three days and nights**, declaring to the **Ten Directions**, petitioning the **Supreme Dao Lord, Supreme Venerable Lord Lao, the Emperor of Golden Gate Supreme Peace, the Later Sage Lord of Jade Sovereignty, and the Three Sacred Celestial Sovereigns**—all with **yellow tablets bearing red script**. Only after this **report is received** may one **begin the transmission**, following the prescribed rites.\n\n**Initial Reception** consists of **three**—\n*Note: The Three Elements (Upper, Middle, Lower).*\n**and five**—\n*Note: The Five Stars, Five Spirits, Five Phases, Five Tones, Five Forms, Five Viscera, Five Fingers, Five Heads, Five *qi*s.*\nAs the *Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl Scripture* states:\n‘In Heaven, they are the **Five Stars**; in the Dao, they are the **Five Spirits**; in the numinous, they are the **Five Phases**; in music, they are the **Five Tones**; on Earth, they are the **Five Peaks**; in humans, they are the **Five Viscera**; in the hand, they are the **Five Fingers**; in the law, they are the **Five Heads**; in prohibitive arts, they are the **Five *qi*s**—thus, they are **three times five, fifteen in total**.’\nHuman **life and destiny** belong to these **Five Phases**.\n\nThe **Later Sage Lord** instructed **Emperor Yin’s True Person** on the **oral transmission**:\n‘Those who know to receive the **three and five** each have their **merits**; follow the teacher’s guidance in reception.’\n\nIf the **aspirant depends on the teacher** and the teacher **does not violate the rites**, and if the **transmission of the law and talismans is properly conferred**, then such resolve **will surely attain the Dao**.\nThe Scripture says:\n‘The **Supreme Dao is the teacher**; the **aspirant seeks the Dao**. Having received the **three elements to their utmost**, one endures for **a hundred *kalpas** and lives eternally.’\n\nUpon completion, the **Five Stars reappear**, granting **longevity, immortality, world-transcendence, and ascension**—this is the **Upper Clarity Law**.\n\nIf the **Law resides in another land**, one must **go to that land**.\n*Note: The Scripture says: ‘A **clear teacher and supreme law** may be in distant lands. If one seeks to receive it, one must not **beg the teacher to come**, for even if they do, it is **not the true law**. If there is a **royal command** that one cannot refuse, then one may **properly invite them**. The invitation must not violate the **ritual statutes**.’*\n\nIf the **Law is on the **Sacred Mountain**, one must **go to the Sacred Mountain**.\n*Note: The **Later Sage Lord** told the **Later Sage Grand Marshal**:\n‘Your **rank is noble yet humble**; you cannot attain the Dao. I have prepared your **body** for this. If the Dao is in the **mountains**, you must **depend on the mountain** to receive it. If the Dao is in the **city**, you must **depend on the city** to receive it. If the Dao is with a **lowly, vulgar person**, you must still **follow their instruction** in reception. **Do not disrespect the teacher or belittle the Dao**. Even if your words seem slight, you will **lose your human form** and become a **lower ghost**, never regaining humanity. Even if you are the wife of a **frivolous, lowly man**, yet you possess **virtue and power**, and you **kneel before him as a disciple**, how could you suddenly **mock him with words**, blame yourself, and call him a **foolish youth**, ignorant of a **common, vulgar woman**, yet receive the **three and five** and the **Upper Clarity Law**? Your regret would be profound. Do you not recall these words?’\n\nThe **Grand Marshal** replied:\n‘I **inquired of a foolish, vulgar person** and **laughed at the teacher**, acting with **frivolous disrespect**. Now that I have attained the **position of Upper True Person** and am called **Heaven’s Noble Lady**, I **mocked the utterly foolish and vulgar**, with **no wisdom or recognition**—a **deadly sin**. I humbly pray that the **Celestial Sovereign and Great Dao’s power** take pity, and I **beg to know what rites or offerings** I may make to **atonement**.’\n\nThe **Later Sage Lord** spoke again:\n‘You need only **wear the three-and-five talismans**, **repent on your natal day**, and **apologize for your words**. You must also **repent on *jiazi* days** and within **two years**, you shall **attain the Dao**.’\nThe Grand Marshal **followed these instructions**, and two years later, the **Later Sage Lord** summoned him as the **Grand Marshal of the Southern Palace**, overseeing the **ten heavens’ union for ascension**. **Do not belittle the Dao of the teacher!**\n\nThe **Later Sage Lord** again instructed **Emperor Yin’s True Person**:\n‘Even a **common teacher** has their **principles**; one must **not speak ill of them**. How much more so if the teacher **has Daoic resolve**—one must **never speak ill**, lest one **fail the test**. The **Supreme Lord sees from afar** and will **certainly impose punishment**. The **crime of disrespecting the teacher** causes **disciples to lose their immortality**, demoting them **two ranks**, and the teacher is also **demoted a rank**. **Beware! Beware!**’\n\nThe **Venerable Lord Lao** says:\n‘To **transmit the Great Dao’s law** as a teacher—if one has **not fathomed the Dao’s source**, has **not communicated with spirits or harmonized with Heaven and Earth**, and lacks **meritorious deeds in saving the world**—then one **should not be a teacher**. To **recklessly transmit the Supreme Dao** will cause **future generations to lose the Dao’s lineage**, and the **offense is not light**. Such **heavenly tribunals judge as crimes of leaking secrets**.’\n\nIn the **Yellow Emperor’s era**, there was **South Mountain Lord**—\n*Note: Surname **South**, given name **Mountain Lord**; he hid in the mountains and studied deeply, mastering the **Confucian rites and music**.*",

I do not dare to presumptuously refuse instruction, nor do I dare to transmit without succession. I humbly accept the crime of receiving stolen transmissions.\n\nThe True Person [真人] said: *\"Unrighteous! You presumptuously transmitted as if receiving the Law [妄传为受法]. You yourself have not yet attained spiritual penetration [通灵], nor have you fulfilled your allotted years. How much have you violated the precepts? There is no name for ‘theft’ here—according to this, you should be demoted from the Dao.\"*\n\n\"Only if you have nurtured the Recommended One, Broad-Chest Lord [广成君], and he guarantees no leakage, will you yourself be free of offense.\"\n\nLord West Mountain bowed twice, acknowledging his death-guilt and offering repeated thanks.\n\nThe True Person ascended to the Heavenly Palace and reported Lord West Mountain’s transgression to the Most High [太上].\n*Note: If this is followed, one must not transmit recklessly—transmission must align with its principles and precepts.*\n\nLater, the Holy Sovereign [圣君] told the Heavenly Master [天师]:\n\"You inherit and transmit the Three-Five True Laws [三五正法], the Upper Clarity True Scriptures [上清真经], and the Inner Scriptures [内箓], encompassing the Three Primordials [三元] and the Five Spirits [五灵].\n*Note: The Five Spirits’ Laws [五灵法] are complete within the Three Primordials, hence called the Five Spirits.*\n\nUpon completion, one receives True *qi*.\n*Note: *Qi* has three grades.\nThe highest grade is the Three Primordials, which refine *qi* into Heavenly Dao Scriptures and Laws [大道文法].\nThe middle grade is the Five Phases [五行], which refine True *qi* into Heavenly Martial Laws [武法].\nThe lowest grade is the Six Jia [六甲], called Spirit-*qi*, which operates between Heaven and Earth and among humans—this is the One Dao, One Martial [一文一武], the power to inhibit and communicate with spirits.\nThus, the initial stage of Daoist practice is the first rank of immortality and divinity.\n\nCommand the later disciples: none should receive the Scriptures and Laws without first following this sequence. Those who complete the cycle receive these three grades of True *qi*, knowing the gates of cultivation and achieving daily spiritual merit.\n\nThe superior adept, upon fulfilling three thousand merits, ascends in broad daylight. This encompasses the Three Primordials, the Five Phases, the Six Jia, and the Seven Stars.\n*Note: The Star-Stepping Method [蹑步] follows the Heavenly and Earthly Laws [天纲地纪法].*\n\nThe Six Laws,\n*Note: The Six Laws are: One Orthodoxy [正一], the Three Primordials [三元], the Five Phases [五行], the Six Jia [六甲], the Seven Stars [七星], and the Eight Trigrams and Nine Palaces [八卦九宫]. Together, they govern Heaven, Earth, and spirits, encompassing all without exception, driving and commanding them.*\n\nUpon completion, they are divided into banners [旌], nodes [节], and inscribed with the Sword Edict [授剑]. When finished, the Master divides the banners, nodes, and name tablets at the Earthly Portal of the Nine Immortal Palace [洞府地户九仙宫之门].\n*Note: The Earthly Portal Nine Immortal Palace is the Bracketed Azure Grotto Heaven [括苍洞天]. Within Bracketed Azure Mountain, the Eastern Orthodoxy is Mount Le-Cheng [东正乐成], the Western connection is Bracketed Prefecture [西连括州], the Southern Orthodoxy is Yongjia [南正永嘉], and the Northern border is Mount Le-An [北接乐安].*\n\nAfter the Master completes the transmission at the gate, he writes out the human-world Scriptures, Laws, and Sacred Texts sufficient for practice. Then, through the Six Jia Laws and the Star-Stepping Method, one cultivates and achieves spiritual merit, fulfilling the merit to ascend in broad daylight.\n\nIf one wishes to descend to the mortal world, or if the Master petitions, one is granted an official position among the True Officials of the World. You must inherit and record this, sealing it into the immortal lineage and registers, reporting it one by one to the Heavenly Bureau [天曹籍].\n\nThus, the Heavenly Master, following the Most High’s words, established twenty-four administrative districts in the West Sichuan Mountains as governance, appointing officials to embody the Earthly Portal Nine Immortal Palace’s intent.\n*Note: The Heavenly Master said: ‘The Eastern and Southern Earthly Portals are distant, so I established the Sichuan Mountains as twenty-four districts.’ Each district was petitioned to register ten thousand ascended immortals to replace the Nine Immortals of the Earthly Portal Palace.*\n\nWhile the Heavenly Master lived, the Earthly Portal Palace’s affairs were managed in Sichuan. After the Heavenly Master ascended, they were moved to the Eastern Orthodoxy Grotto Heaven within Bracketed Azure Mountain.\n\nAll earthly matters are reported to the Heavenly Bureau here, and responses are given. Heavenly Edicts descend accordingly.\n\nThe Venerable Lord [老君] told the Eastern Sea Water-and-Land Immortal Mother:\n*Note: The Water-and-Land Immortal Mother is Peng’s Wife [彭夫人], the eldest daughter of Pengzu.*\nInitially, she married into the Wang clan, but her husband died after ten years. She then married into the Meng clan, but he also died. Thus, she withdrew into seclusion, devoting herself to the Dao.\n\nInitially, she saw an earth snake moving along a winding path. She began practicing its three-step serpentine gait, often imitating it, and took delight in it. After seven years of this, she suddenly saw a woman who said: *\"You are learning the Step of the Halter [步纲].\"* She replied: *\"I was merely playing with irregular movements—this is not the Step of the Halter.\"*\n\nBecause she daily practiced the serpent’s gait, her footsteps gradually became familiar, pleasing to others, though she had no intention of seeking the Dao. Such reckless movement—how could I, with sincere resolve, engage in such deceit? What benefit would it bring to those cultivating the heart?\n\nThe woman said: *\"The serpent’s step is the Dragon’s Halter—it wards off inauspiciousness. I am the middle daughter of the Western Queen Mother [西王母仲女]. Seeing my mother practice the Step of the Halter, I gave you the Earthly Measure Method [蹑地纪之法].\"*\n\nAfter practicing for fourteen years, she ascended to the Eastern Sea, where the Most High sealed her at Fangzhang Mountain, where she resides as the Water-and-Land Immortal Mother. She was ordered to oversee the women of Fangzhang and the seas and lands who seek immortality, teaching them as the Heavenly Messenger of the Dao. She said:\n\n*\"You are of mortal birth, receiving instruction from the Immortal Teacher. Your ascension will be swift. You must teach others, transmitting your resolve to humanity.\"*",

Dare I betray the Teacher’s grace? I humbly beseech divine protection.\n\nThen, **twirl the Three Teachers’ Incantation**. *(Note: On the left hand’s fourth finger, first joint, facing left.)*\n\nAfter performing the rites on the **five-colored silk**, having completed the incantation—*(Note: The scripture says: After binding with the five-colored silk, one must then twirl the silk again before reciting the spell.)*—then proceed with the ritual.\n\nThis spell is the **Secret of the Later Sage Emperor**, not to be passed to the world. **One character is worth ten thousand gold**—do not transmit it.\n\nRecite the **Later Sage Emperor’s Incantation Given to Chi Sōngzi**. *(Note: Command that not a single character be carelessly transmitted; keep it secret.)*\n\nThe **Taiping** title now emerges in this age, as heaven and earth transmit it through the **Great Teacher**. **Yuánshǐ** first obtained it, heaven and earth forming it together. **Yuánshǐ** transmitted it, the **Dao Lord** knowing it first, hence the title **Supreme Venerable Lord**.\n\nPreserved across generations, **Pángǔ the Heavenly Emperor** received it. The **Human Emperor** and **Earth Emperor** successively taught one another, giving rise to the **Five Emperors**, the **Six Jia** and **Ten Heavenly Stems**, the **Twelve Earthly Branches**, the sun, moon, and stars, the **Rotating Sphere and Seven Governors**, all harmoniously transmitted. **Xī** and **Shénnóng**, the **Yellow Emperor**, and their descendants all inherited it properly. *(Note: Wùyóu’s son hid it; it was not transmitted for five thousand years.)*\n\nIn the **Yáo** dynasty, it was passed to the **Western Barbarians**, who became kings and teachers, flourishing for **one thousand five hundred years**.

There is verification for this.)*\n\n**Three Heavens Departed, Azure Heaven Divine, Crimson Heaven Radiant, Seven Heavens Net, Wú Heaven Bright, Azure Heaven Named, Eight Heavens Resplendent, Imperial Heaven Pearl, Yǔyú Heaven Devouring, Nine Heavens Pressed, Dragon Heaven Revived, King Heaven Mysterious.**\n\nAbove are **fifteen phrases**, declaring my **eighty-one gates**. The **Red Mother Water Gate** is acceptable. *(Note: The above is the Later Sage Emperor’s transmission to the Twenty-Eight True Persons of Xuánzhōu, who chanted together and stored the Teacher in thought. Within seven years, the twenty-eight ascended together to Xuánzhōu as True Persons. This is the inner taboo of yin-yang and the Five Phases, and also the hidden name of the True Consort within the Northern Dipper. The Later Sage Emperor treasured this as an extraordinary secret—do not dare to casually transmit it.)*\n\nThe **eleven characters** are recorded at the end of the second volume of the *Golden Lock Flowing Pearl*.\n\nIf people see it but do not know how to apply it, one must use this passage to explain it before understanding.\n\nThere are also **two characters of the True Person’s name within the Northern Dipper**. Call upon it, and the Teacher will appear before you. In **three steps**, speak softly, invoking the Teacher’s compassionate step of the Halter, requesting instruction. May the Teacher teach me to **walk the Earth’s Measure**, **fly into Heaven’s Halter**, seeking life and attaining it, seeking nobility and attaining it, seeking healing and recovering, all wishes fulfilled, all desires granted. Through Dao practice, I attain immortality, my household receiving blessings, both inner and outer touched by grace. The disciple dares not betray the Teacher’s kindness. **Two bows**, then **close the qi for three breaths**, chanting the **True Person’s name within the Dipper**, and proceed with the rites.\n\nThe **True Person’s name within the Dipper** is **Gē**. The **Lord’s name** is **Jiān**. Call upon them **three times**, twirl the **Northern Dipper Incantation**, and then step the Halter.\n\n**Thirdly, the Examination and Summoning Ritual for the Platform and Teacher’s Rites**, as in the *Pure and Precious Examination and Summoning Rites*:\n\nThe **Examination and Summoning Ritual** is to examine ghosts and summon gods. The matter is great, not small—**purity and clarity** are required. Establish the platform, set up the registers, build the prison, and open the gate. Tie the rope around the platform and prison; the platform has **four gates**, with **forbidden steps and boundary seals**. Place the **green incense case and clear lamp**; at night, during the **first watch’s third hour**, it is acceptable.\n\nSeal the boundary, restrain the water, and prohibit the platform. **Reside in the heart with Yǔ’s Step**, encircle the outside in a **Ding-character formation**, and sprinkle water within the platform.\n\nThen, stand facing west, invoking the **Three Pure Ones’ Examination and Summoning Pure and Precious Master, Lord Li**, clad in **floating purple robes**, crowned with sword, riding **flying purple clouds**, all arriving from the **west-north**, circling the platform **three times**.\n\nThen, the Teacher shall **seal the platform with me**, leading the **Yang Soldiers** to the **Heavenly Tribunals and Human Intervals**, together with the **talisman soldiers within my body**, united in heart and strength, for the sake of **this household’s**—whether to **capture malevolent ghosts** or **fulfill a certain matter**.\n\nAgain, **Lord Zhōu** leads the **Yin Soldiers**, assisting within **this body**, entering the **underworld and waters**, or the **tomb of this household**, seizing the **ghost bandits harming this household**, bringing them to the platform for interrogation.

The **vital spirits** (*jīngyāo*) shall be **beheaded at the waist**, and the household’s afflictions—whether **disease or misfortune**—shall be **alleviated and resolved**.\n\n*Note: The following words may be added as needed, and the invocation may be adjusted accordingly.*\n\n**Proceed to the summoning ritual.**\n*Note: The summoning ritual requires contemplating the Master’s presence before one’s body.*\n\nThe **Three Elements and Nine Heavenly Generals** shall be led, along with the **Five Virtue/Power Generals** (*Wǔdé Jiāngjūn*)—five in number—and **a hundred thousand soldiers**, arrayed to encircle the target’s dwelling. If the disciple performs this alone, they shall **fortify their own household’s gates and doors**, stationing **sixteen guards at each door** (*chāi yī shíliù rén bǎ yī mén bā rén liè mén yībiān*), with blades facing downward, and **one guard per door** (*yīyī lìzhù dāo*), as if in military formation, deploying **soldiers and officers** (*fǔ liè xíngzhèn*) to **seize the encampment’s gates**, resembling the **austerity of a tribunal**.\n\nUpon completion, the Master shall appear, riding upon **nine-colored clouds** (*jiǔsè yún*) or a **lion**, arriving from the **east**. The disciple shall lead the soldiers to **patrol the target’s doors and gates above and below**, **establishing protective barriers** (*jiéjiè*), **sealing with prohibitions** (*jìnzhòu*), and **pursuing with talismans and writs** (*zhuīdié*), ensuring all rites are properly observed.\n\nThe Master shall **emanate radiant light from the void** (*fàng chū guāngmíng*), **summoning soldiers** (*yǒng chū bīngshì*) to **encircle the seas and block the earth**, **inspecting the Heavenly Prisons of the Nine Heavens** (*rào tiān jiǎn yù*), and **extract the three souls and seven spirits** (*sān hún qī pò*) of **certain relatives or individuals** (*mǒu qīn biǎo mǒu rén*). If the target is a woman, it is **fourteen spirits** (*shísì pò*). The **three souls** (*sān hún*) shall be **separated from the ghost** (*dé lí yāo*), and within the courtyard, they shall **attach to the disciple’s own body**, thereby **curing the disease instantly**.\n\n**Twirl the Three Masters’ incantations** (*niǎn sān shī tiàomù*).\n*Note: The incantations are located on the left hand’s fifth finger—first is the Master’s incantation, second is the Orthodox Dao/Way Master’s incantation, and third is the Heavenly Master’s incantation. The Orthodox Dao/Way Master’s incantation for summoning the Heavenly Master’s disciples to assist is as follows:*\nThe **Later Sage** (*Hòushèngjūn*) instructs the Heavenly Master: *\"If one visualizes the Master’s presence as a substitute, and the Master understands this method, it shall be effective. If the Master does not understand this method but only knows the transmitted rituals of succession and talisman-writing, then visualization shall not be used. Otherwise, the rites shall fail, the prohibitions shall not subdue, and retribution shall ensue. Do not presume to act—beware, beware!\"*\n\n**Visualize the Master’s soldiers emerging**, each as prescribed by the method. **Refer to previous annotations.**\n\nNext, **contemplate the Twenty-Eight Constellations** (*Érshíbā Xiù*), arraying them upon one’s body. Then, **invoke the Nine Heavenly Generals and their officers and soldiers** (*Jiǔ Jiāngjūn Lì bīngshì*), ensuring the **Three Elements are fully prepared** (*Sānyuán bèijù*), as detailed in the **Comprehensive Diagram** (*Hán tú*).\n*Note: The diagram contains the full complement of the Three Elements’ soldiers and generals.*\n\n**Twirl the Three Elements’ Generals’ incantations** (*niǎn Sānyuán Jiāngjūn tiàomù*).\n*Note: The incantations are located on the left hand’s thumb—first is the heart of the first node.*\n\nUpon completion, the disciple shall **face the ritual seat** (*xiàng àn biān zuòyí*), recite the scripture, and **summon the spirits and ghosts** (*chào shén yāo guǐ shàng*). The disciple shall **interrogate the perpetrators of the affliction**, recording their names and **sentencing them to imprisonment**. Later, the disciple shall submit a **red petition** (*chì zhāng*), requesting the **Heavenly Soldiers** (*Tiān bīng*) to **execute and behead the malevolent spirits**, so that the **disease may swiftly heal** or **certain matters may swiftly resolve**.\n\n**Offer gratitude and conclude the rites.**\n*Note: There are invocations within the soldier-deployment rites; these are not repeated here.*\n\nThe **Later Sage** further instructs the Heavenly Master: *\"These six methods of summoning and interrogation are universal among mortals. The first is to **cure demonic afflictions** (*yízhòu*) and **diseases**, **seize and subdue malevolent spirits and ghosts** (*zhūdié zhēngyāo*), and **execute them**. The second is to **investigate the Heavenly Tribulations and Underworld** (*kān Tiānkēo Dìfǔ*), determining **one’s lifespan, fortune, and social standing** (*niánmìng chángduǎn, pínfù guìjiàn*). The third is to **prohibit and sever public and private grievances and mutual harm** (*gōngsī yuān duì xiāng hài*). The fourth is to **resolve conflicts between spouses or lovers** (*nánnǚ shēngmìng xiāng kè*), ensuring they **do not harm each other**, and **permanently harmonize**, escaping **metal and wood calamities** (*jīn mù zhī zāi*), **water and fire disasters** (*shuǐ huǒ zhī hài*), and **obstacles of disobedience**. The fifth is to **dispel public and private curses and hexes** (*zāi zhòu*), **vengeful ghosts**, and **harm from spirits**, whether from the living or the dead, as well as **plotted slander and verbal assaults** (*túmóu kǒushé zhī hài*), all of which shall be **consumed**, leaving no trace of harm between parties. The sixth is to **mitigate celestial and terrestrial disasters** (*Tiāndì zāihài*), such as **untimely winds and rains** (*fēngyǔ bùshí*), **imbalanced Four Qi** (*sì qì bùzhèng*), **venomous dragons and malevolent ghosts** (*dúlóng zhēngyāo*), **excessive floods or droughts** (*yínshuǐ yínhàn*), and **epidemic and toxic spirits** (*wēndú guǐ qì*). If not performed by a **Properly Orthodox Dao/Way Practitioner** (*Zhèngtiān xíngzhě*), this method shall **remove them as well**.*\n\nThe **Later Sage** further declares to the Heavenly Master: *\"These six categories of summoning and interrogation are the **Supreme Dao/Way Lord** (*Tàishàng Dàdào Jūn*), who **refined and cultivated the true and authentic qi of Heaven and Earth** (*jié xí Tiāndì zhēnzhèng qì*), establishing the **talisman, writ, and scripture rites** (*fújié jīngfǎ*). There are **three thousand eight hundred and one stages** (*yī qiān sānbǎi bāshí yī jiē*) within the **Three Elements’ Orthodox Talismans** (*Sānyuán Zhèngjié*), sufficient to **qualify as a Grand Summoning Master** (*Kǎochāo Dàfǎshī*). This shall **open the Martial and Civil Divisions** (*kāi Wǔnǚ Bù*), appointing **left and right inspecting officers** (*tuīxún guān*), **judicial officers** (*pàn guān*), and **assistant summoning masters** (*fù Kǎochāo Fǎshī*). Such is the **Great Dao/Way**, the **wondrous method of salvation for humankind and benefit for all things** (*miào shàng jiùrén jì wù zhī dàfǎ*). Those who **receive and practice it faithfully** (*néng shòu néng xíng, bù qī bù wàng*) shall **ascend to the Highest Truth** (*lì qǔ shàngzhēn*).\n\nThis method’s merit is **three thousandfold** (*gōng mǎn sāniàn*), enabling **daytime ascension from the household** (*báizhōu shàngshēng*), where **all family members and livestock** shall **together attain Heaven**.\n\n*Note: The merit of three thousand is divided into two categories—this reflects the distinction between the Martial and Civil Divisions. The first category, the **Civil Rites** (*Wénfǎ*), involves studying the **Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl** (*Jīnsuǒ Liúzhū*), **walking the Earth’s Measure** (*Niè dì jì*), **soaring the Heavenly Ropes** (*Fēi Tiān gāng*), **dispersing the Steps of Yu** (*Sàn yǔ bù*), **twirling the True Incantations** (*niǎn zhēn tiàomù*), and **performing these rites year-round without cessation**. One shall **cultivate hidden virtue** (*yīn dé*), **renounce sensory pleasures** (*chú shēngsè*), **avoid idle speech** (*kǒu bù wàng xuān*), and **refrain from spreading falsehoods** (*xīn bù wàng chuán*). Internally, one shall **refine hidden virtue** (*nèi xiū yīn dé*).\n\nOne shall **wear the Six Hexagram Talismans and Scriptures** (*Fú liù jiǎ fúwén*), **don the Five Talismans** (*dài wǔ fú*), and **walk the Five Phases’ Steps** (*bù wǔ xíng*), whether **authentic or counterfeit** (*zhēn wěi*). One shall **remain silent, concealed, and speak little**, **not be misled by others**, and **ensure that grand earthen structures and resounding bells and drums** (*guǎng zào tǔmù gōngdiàn, shēng zá zhōnggǔ*) are constructed—thus, **this method shall eliminate such disturbances**. One shall **solely guard the heart and refine inner cultivation**, **follow the scriptures’ steps and measures**, **wear the talismans**, and **visualize the true and wondrous rites** (*cún zhèng zhēn miào fǎ*). After **twenty-seven years**, the **Supreme Dao/Way Lord**, the **Former Sage, the Hollow Emperor** (*Qūhuáng*), and the **Golden Threshold Emperor of the Great Peace** (*Tàipíng Jīn què Dì*), along with the **Later Sage, the Jade Emperor** (*Xuānyuán Yùhuáng Shàngdàojūn*), shall **dispatch emissaries to welcome** the disciple, enabling **daytime ascension to Heaven**. The **Martial Immortals** (*Wénxiān Zhēn guān*) shall recognize them as **Civil Rites Masters** (*Wénlǐ Fǎshī).*」",

      "translated_text": "「The First Rank of Martial Dao/Way, first taught by the Venerable Lord Lao, involves summoning the Six Grades to examine and rescue sentient beings from illness. When one’s merit reaches three thousand, and the lives saved number three hundred thousand, those who attain enlightenment through healing and those who benefit from their deeds shall be granted joy and nourishment for three thousand souls—this is called *Function of the Multitude*. When the total reaches three thousand, one ascends to Heaven in broad daylight.\n\nThis First Rank of Civil Dao/Way allows only solitary ascension, without transporting one’s residence to Heaven.\n\nIf one practices both Civil and Martial Dao/Way, their entire household—including fowl and dogs—shall ascend together, attaining the rank of Heavenly Sage-King.\n\n**Fourth:** Practice the *Restraint of Qi* for all things between Heaven and Earth. Master Hu Gong’s *Restraint of Qi* scripture states:\nThe *Restraint of Heaven Master* is Li Bo Yang—*note: also the appellation of the Venerable Lord*.\nThe *Restraint of Earth Master* is Luo Wenqiang.\nThe *Restraint of the Halter Master* is Hu Xuanzang—these three are the primary leaders of the *Restraint Halter* traditions.\nThose learning *Restraint* must first visualize these three descending from the void, their cloud-canopied radiance converging at the nape, clad in purple robes amid nine clouds.\nWith the left hand, pinch the *Supreme Restraint*—visualizing them within three steps—then bow three times in reverence.\nIf the *qi* enters, perform nine bows to each of the three masters, three bows per figure.\nWhen complete, follow the original formula to restrain a specific matter or thing—this is highly efficacious.\n*Note: Each formula is pinched according to its respective restraint.*\nThe *Restraint of Qi Three Masters’ Formula* is located on the left hand’s fourth finger at the first joint, and also on the fifth finger’s first joint.\nAfter pinching the formula, take three *Yu Steps*, then chant the restraint incantation.\n*Note: The incantation varies according to the specific restraint.*\nThe Later Sage-King told the Heavenly Master:\n*\"To restrain all things between Heaven and Earth, the master’s name must differ accordingly.\"*\n*Note: This implies succession.*\nThe *Restraint of Heaven Master* is Zhao Boqin.\nThe *Restraint of Earth Master* is Yin Fuzhi.\nThe *Restraint of Ghost Master* is Huang Tiansheng.\nThe *Restraint of Human Master* is Zhang Tuling.\nThese are newly supplemented, yet must be visualized alongside the previous masters, bowing in reverence before performing any of the hundred restraints—all shall succeed divinely.\nThe Heavenly Master’s lineage must be succeeded; why limit reverence to only the previous masters? Three bows suffice.\n\n**Fifth:** Entering armies, mountains, or waters, or traveling to foreign lands where fear of harm or loss of life is imminent—urgent methods to invoke the master’s salvation.\n*Note: This protects oneself and one’s household; do not transmit recklessly, lest it harm the master.*\nThe Yellow Emperor obtained the *Play of the Mysterious Woman’s Urgent Military Strategies* (*Xuánnǚ Bīngjī Jíyào Lù*), saying:\n*\"Those who follow the army without injury—my maiden has the Nine-Heaven Concealment Method. You may pass it to your successors for urgent use. When needed, visualize me as your master, leading soldiers to guard above the Nine Heavens, departing the Nine Calamities, and vanishing unseen, with ten thousand cavalry unable to pursue.\"*\n*Note: From this martial method’s formation, there are formations of the Nine Heavens Above, the Nine Calamities Within, the Nine Earths Below, the Void and Space Within, the Eight Arrays Inside and Outside, the Five Phases Within and the Five Weapons Without—sufficient to calculate the Nine Heavens Above.*\nVisualize the *Original Two-Formation Master*, the *Twelve-Formation Master*, and the *Thirty-Six-Formation Master* within the Nine Calamities, deploying a hundred-thousand-strong army within the Nine Diagrams and Eight Arrays, thus vanishing unseen.\nThis method is profound and difficult to grasp; even a master must demonstrate it face-to-face, lest one fail to execute it properly.\nThe Emperor received it, and indeed encountered fifty-nine battles, defeating Chiyou seven times.\nThe Emperor visualized the Original Master, Xuannü, and transformed the *Thunder Lord Taiyi’s Liu Ren* formations, shielding himself as he emerged—no army could perceive him.\nWhen seen, the Emperor’s form rose above the Nine Heavens.\n*Note: The Nine Heavens Above have their own formation scriptures, fully recorded hereafter.*\nThis wards off calamities.\nThus, even those who merely cultivate the Dao, though not leading armies, may wield Dao-power. Should Heaven’s favor descend, one might suddenly receive celestial talismans, forming a hundred-thousand-strong array to save a million souls—urgently responding to the command.\nFirst, visualize the *Formation Master* clad in crimson robes, holding a scepter and formation, descending through the sky to guard the disciple, emerging above the Nine Heavens.\nPray for the master’s descent, leading generals and soldiers.\n*Note: Among the generals—both Upper and Lower Elements—there are six generals. Within the formations, six generals command troops; visualize each leading fifty thousand soldiers, encircling the body three times, then circling again three times, vanishing above the Nine Heavens. Swiftly, as the law decrees.*\nFor a hundred thousand, a million, or ten million troops.\nLet Li [your surname] and the disciple serve as the Grand General, with the master as the Deputy General.\nNext, visualize the *Chief Halter Restraint Master*—*note: the master of the Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl*—Li Hui, descending on clouds, riding a five-colored lion, clutching the Heavenly Formation in purple robes, stopping three steps ahead, then bow three times in reverence.\nThen bow three times to the *Formation Master* who protects the Grand General.\nAfterward, pinch the *Three Masters’ Formation Formula*.\n*Note: The formula is on the right side of the left hand’s fifth finger’s first joint.*\nRetrieve the formation talisman from the chest, don it on the head, then charge through enemy lines on horseback, entering and exiting battle unharmed.\n\n**Five Talismans:**\n1. *Talisman for Unharmed Entry into Battle*\n2. *Talisman for the Enemy’s General Feeling Awe and Respect, Preventing Harm*\n3. *Talisman for Overcoming Difficult Battles*\n4. *Talisman for Commanding Strong Enemies*\n5. *Talisman for Strengthening the Army’s Morale and Combat Power, Fulfilling All Desires*\n\n**Heavenly Art: First Talisman for Unharmed Entry into Battle**\n*Within this scroll, the talisman is inscribed in vermilion.*\n*Usage:* Write the enemy general’s name beneath the talisman, then seal it with the *Great Void* and lunar stem-branch. The Heavenly Emperor’s seal shall be affixed.",

five in endless interplay—\n**Qi** and **color** coalesce into **form**, and this is called **spirit**.\n\n**Spirit** and **form** have names,\nMarking their stations and clarifying their ranks—\nThey aid each other in transforming malevolence,\nGuard the upright and preserve life,\nSeeking immortality and renown.\n\nWith **incantations** and **seals**, they assist the realm and defend the family,\nDissolving guilt and bestowing blessings,\nProtecting the virtuous and exterminating the wicked—\nAll may become generals, officers, or soldiers.\n\nDifferent ages, different laws—\nIn times of simplicity, some may follow the **rituals of submission and humility**.\nIn eras of excess, others may prefer the **condensed essentials of practice**.\n\nThus, the **Dao/Way** adapts—\nRestraining or expanding, concealing or revealing—\nLater disciples who achieve perfection,\nAssuming the **Mysterious Mandate** of their station,\nResiding by name in their native villages,\nEmerging in each generation—\nSome may lack nothing, but today we record only what the **Master of the Way** transmitted as follows:\n\nThe **Later Sage** and **Divine Sovereign** instructed **Zhang Daoling**:\n*\"If you wish to cultivate and practice,\nFirst know the **origin of life and death**.*\n\n*The **origin of life and death** determines **calamity and blessing**,\nEstablishing clear distinctions—\nThose who gain blessings flourish as **kings**,\nThose who lose blessings decline.\nAnd those who incur **calamity** perish,\nWhile those who avoid **calamity** survive.\nTo eliminate **punishment and calamity**,\nOne must discern the **origin of life and death**.*\n\n*For instance, a person born under the **Jiazi cycle** with a **Golden Command**—\nTheir **Primordial Qi** rests in **Chen**,\nAnd **Chen** belongs to the **Xun direction**, encompassing all.\nThe **origin of life and death** is in **Si**,\nWhich matures into **Wu**, thrives in **Shen**,\nAnd reaches its peak in **You**—\n**You** is the **hour of the king and minister**,\n**You** embodies **blessing and virtue**,\n**Wei** is the **hour of rest**,\n**Hai** is the **hour of decline**,\n**Zi** is the **hour of punishment**,\nAnd **fire** is the **hour of calamity**.\nThis is the **Wuyu Star**.*\n\n*A person born under the **Wood Command**—\nTheir **origin of life and death** is in **Hai**,\nWhich matures into **Zi** and **Chou**,\nThrives in **Yin**,\nAnd reaches its peak in **Mao**—\n**Mao** is the **hour of the king and minister**,\n**Mao** embodies **blessing and virtue**,\n**Chen** is the **hour of rest**,\n**Si** is the **hour of decline**,\n**Wu** is the **hour of punishment**,\nAnd **metal** is the **hour of calamity**.\nThis is the **Jinyuan Star**.*\n\n*A person born under the **Shen Command** with a **Water Command**—\nTheir **origin of life and death** is in **Shen**,\nWhich matures into **You** and **Xu**,\nThrives in **Hai**,\nAnd reaches its peak in **Zi**—\n**Zi** embodies **blessing and virtue**,\n**Chou** is the **hour of rest**,\n**Yin** is the **hour of decline**,\n**Mao** is the **hour of punishment**,\nAnd **earth** is the **hour of calamity**.\nThis is the **Shuiyuan Star**—\nAnd similarly, those born under the **Earth Command** share the **Water Command**’s pattern.*\n\n*For those born under the **Fire Command**—\nTheir **origin of life and death** is in **Yin**,\nWhich matures into **Mao** and **Chen**,\nThrives in **Si**,\nAnd reaches its peak in **Wu**—\n**Wu** embodies **blessing and virtue**,\n**Wei** is the **hour of rest**,\n**Shen** is the **hour of decline**,\n**You** is the **hour of punishment**,\nAnd **water** is the **hour of calamity**.\nThis is the **Shuiyuan Star**.*\n\n*For those born under the **Earth Command**—\nTheir **origin of life and death** is in **Xu**,\nAnd **Xu** is the **hour of the king and minister**,\n**Xu** embodies **blessing and virtue**,\n**Wei** is the **hour of rest**,\n**Shen** is the **hour of decline**,\n**Mao** is the **hour of punishment**,\nAnd **wood** is the **hour of calamity**.\nThis is the **Zhuyuan Star**.*\n\n*Now, those who cultivate must first practice the **Yugong Steps**,\nThen the **Northern Dipper**,\nThen the **Central Dipper**—\nThe **Central Dipper** is called the **Heavenly Ruler**,\nThus one **leaps in flight**.\nNext, the **Three Platforms**,\nThen the **Five Stars**.\n\nThey then employ the **twelfth incantation** from the **upper volume of the Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl Talisman**,\nThe **Flying Heavenly Ruler incantation**,\nAnd petition the **Primordial Qi** of the **Yuan Star** (the **Lord of the Mysterious Body and Longevity**)—\nTo command the **Primordial Qi** of the **Zhen Star** (the **Lord of the Soil and the Subduing Qi**),\nSo that **punishment and calamity** may not be recklessly imposed.\n\nIf **punishment and calamity** are imposed upon the **Primordial Qi** of the **Yuan Star**,\nThe **Star Lord** and the **Qingtong Lord** will sever and restrain it—\nSwiftly, as decreed by law.\n\nThe rest follows this pattern.\n\nWithin the *Five Stars Sacred Scripture*,\nThere are already **Five Stars Talismans** to be used,\nTo restrain the **punishment and calamity** of the **Five Phases**,\nAnd preserve **Primordial Qi**.\n\nThe **origin of life and death** refers to one’s **parents**—\n**Annotation:** The **parents**’ **commands** are **golden wood**.\nIf their **commands** clash with one’s own,\nUse a **talisman** to halt the **clash**—\nFor if one’s own **command** does not clash with theirs,\nThen the **origin of life and death** (i.e., **Primordial Qi**) will be made clear.\n*For example:* If a **mother’s command** is **gold** and a **child’s command** is **wood**,\nThe **mother’s command** restrains the **child’s command**—\nThe child will then not live long,\nBut with a **talisman** to halt the **clash**, both **mother and child** will be auspicious.\n\nIf a **mother’s command** is **earth** and a **child’s command** is **wood**,\nThe **child’s command** restrains the **mother’s command**—\nAgain, use the **Five Phases talisman** to halt the **clash**, and both **mother and child** will be auspicious.\n**Annotation:** The rest follows this pattern.\n\nThis principle speaks of the **Primordial Qi** of the **origin of life and death**,\nNot clashing or restraining—\nFor those who cultivate the **Dao/Way**, it brings great fortune,\nAnd they may wear the **Five Phases talisman** to restrain and subdue **calamities**.\n\nUpon completion,\nRecite the **incantation of the parents’ origin of life and death**,\nAnd employ the **talisman to restrain punishment and calamity** for oneself.\n**Annotation:** For example, if one is born under the **Golden Command**,\n**Fire** is the **punishment and calamity**—\nThe **talisman** is detailed in the **Five Phases Palm Talismans**.\n\nThe **invocation** goes thus:\n*\"I was born of my **parents**,\nAnd grew long within the **mundane world**.\nSo it is.\"*\n\nThe **incantations** are found in the **upper volume of the Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl Talisman**—\nThere are two of them.\n\nAfter reciting the **incantation**,\nWalk the **Yugong Steps of the origin of life and death**—\nTwelve steps in total—\nTo restrain **calamities of the origin of life and death**,\nAnd perform this each time one reaches their **native command day**.",

      "translated_text": "The Celestial Master said: *\"Why is Zhou General placed last in the scrolls?*\nThe Most High Laozi spoke: *Because Zhou General is the master of the human heart, and thus the heart is the sovereign spirit of the body. Therefore, Zhou General was composed first as the foremost of the Three Mid-Autumn Generals in the *Flowing Pearl* scrolls. However, according to the *Zheng San Yuan Jing*, the Mid-Autumn Upper Division begins with Tang General, followed by Ge General, and then Zhou General. Now, though arranged first by the Most High’s decree, its application must follow the order prescribed in the *San Yuan Zheng Jing*.\n\nThe method’s purpose is to impart the Most High’s oral transmission—the essential formula of Mid-Autumn’s core technique. First, tread the *Ji* [纪] five times, then disperse into the *Yu Bu* [禹步], three steps with nine traces. Upon completion, adjust the clothing seven times, meditating as prescribed. Then, first visualize Tang General alone within the left kidney, emerging from there—initially only one inch tall, then expanding to eight *zhang*—commanding thirty million troops to a specific province, county, village, or household to address a matter. *Note: This may involve seizing malevolent spirits, a malefactor, or performing exorcisms to cure illness, or confronting malevolent spirits, officials, or those plotting against you. Visualize accordingly, and one image shall suffice for later use.*\n\nThe Later Sage-King instructed Master Zhang: *The Three Elements’ method—note: the Upper, Middle, and Lower Elements govern Heaven, Earth, and Humanity—is for cultivating the Dao, safeguarding one’s family, and subduing malevolence. *Note: ‘Malevolence’ refers to humans; ‘evil’ refers to spirits.* It must not be used for personal aggrandizement but also to rescue others from all calamities. One may then tread the *Ji* three times, disperse into the *Yu Bu*, and adjust the clothing. Upon completion, recite the incantation: ‘I was born of my parents, raised among the vulgar…’ *This incantation appears in the *Di Ji Jing* as the pre-incantation. The formula is on the second joint of the left hand’s first finger.*\n\nLaozi said: *Zhou General is the human heart-spirit. If one practices the Dao to attain spiritual communion, the moment intention arises, action follows—no need for ritualized stepping or complete formalities. *Note: ‘Complete formalities’ means first treading the *Ji*, then the *Yu Bu*, adjusting the clothing, and finally pinching the formula while reciting to manifest. The first stage of cultivation requires these steps, for though beginners may receive scriptures and complete the rites—*note: receiving scriptures and rites is from the *Zhengyi* tradition’s Five Methods of Shangqing*—they must still practice stepping to attain spiritual efficacy. *Note: ‘Stepping’ refers to the Heavenly Halberd; ‘treading’ refers to the Earthly Measure.* Only then does one achieve communion with spirits. *Note: In ancient times, Liu Jiang’s wife, Lady Fan, secretly practiced the Heavenly Halberd and Earthly Measure for fourteen years without her husband’s knowledge. She would act only when he was absent, even during his official duties as county magistrate. One day, a divine being descended on five-colored clouds, accompanied by twenty-four attendants—four celestial boys and four celestial girls—and spoke to Lady Fan: ‘Your merit is complete, your power attained. Now you may act by thought alone—what do you desire?’ Lady Fan replied: ‘I wish to make water stand still and a riding tiger not harm.’ The divine being said: ‘A small matter.’*\"*",

Do not speak of them lightly—**misuse brings calamity upon the Nine Ancestors**, not just oneself.\n\nThe **General Zhou’s Stepping Halberd Method** states:\n*\"Without stepping, none may act; all actions must follow the Stepping Halberd’s order.\"* With deep practice over years, one naturally attains communion with spirits and divine responsiveness—**no longer bound by ritual stepping and treading**; a single thought suffices. **Heaven and earth align as its framework; spirits move at its command.**\n\nIn ancient times, **Yu the Great’s sister, the Flying Immortal**,—*[Note: Some texts name her]*—\nwitnessed her brother practice the Stepping Halberd and learned it herself. **After one year, her minor ailments vanished.** *[Note: Some texts say all diseases were cured.

      "translated_text": "The *Secret Record of the Highest Venerable Lord Lao* (*Gunzhongji*) states:\n\n*\"If one does not employ magical techniques, one relies instead upon the Three Primordial [Daoist] methods. General Tang is then placed above, as first, proceeding in accordance with the natural sequence of Heavenly Dao/Way and numbers. If one practices and utilizes all methods—rewarding the virtuous and punishing the wicked, acting throughout the world, and summoning ghosts and spirits—then General Zhou is first, residing within the heart and belonging to the Lower Primordial. This is for the sake of humanity, and it is also the Lower Primordial’s central method. Thus, General Zhou is placed foremost, acting contrary to Heaven’s Dao/Way, assaulting malevolent rebels, and conferring rewards upon the virtuous, enabling one to follow the *Liuzhu* [method] with certainty and efficacy.\n\nIf one adheres to the principles of Yin-Yang, the *Divine Physician’s Godly and Immortal Prescriptions of the Highest Unity* (*Taiyi Taiyi Shenxian Fang*) states: 'The left represents the **kidney** (*shèn*), the right represents the **Gate of Life** (*mìngmén*).' One may then follow this directive accordingly.\n\nMoreover, General Tang governs the left kidney, while General Ge commands the male **Gate of Life** (*mìngmén*). Thus, when employing the *Bùgāng* [method] to invoke the generals, they are positioned as the second. Each leads three hundred million soldiers to guard the Gate of Life, with the **Western Guardians** (*Xīfāng Wèichén*) following behind to protect the **Mysterious Body** (*Xuànshēn*). When deploying from the right, one follows the *Bùgāng* [method] as illustrated [in the diagram]. When advancing with the diagram’s soldiers—*Bùgāng*—one invokes them as shown in the talismanic gestures. There is no failure in this.\n\n**Bùgāng** [method].\n*[Note: The **General Ge’s Step** (*Bùgāng*) is performed with the right foot first, symbolizing Yin. This is the standard procedure at the outset; do not deviate from it. This method differs from those of Generals Zhou and Tang.]*\n\nLater, the **Sage Emperor** (*Hòushèng Jūn*) instructed **Zhang the Celestial Master** (*Tiānshī Zhāng*): 'Perform the **Bùgāng** [method], then swallow the talismans, and afterward practice the **Bùgāng** [method] again. There are three talismans—Upper, Middle, and Lower.'\n\nThe **Highest Venerable** (*Tàishàng*) commanded **Mìngwén Lìng**: 'First perform the **Three Primordial Bùgāng** [method], then invoke the talismans and dispatch them accordingly.'\n\nIn ancient times, there was a Daoist named **Liu Gen** (*Liú Gēn*), who habitually practiced the **Three Primordial Step** (*sān yuán bù*). Later, it was transformed into the **Nine Progression Step** (*jiǔ jì yǔbù*). After three years of such practice, all spirits and ghosts revered him and obeyed his commands, and his power could move mountains and rivers.\n\nOne day, he was pursued by an **Idiom: County Magistrate** (*Jùnzhǔ*—*Note: County Magistrate, an ancient title for a prefectural governor*), who sought to harm him. The magistrate ordered him to appear before a ghost by day, threatening that if he refused, he would become a ghost himself. Gen was enraged; he performed the **Bùgāng** [method] in the center of the hall, borrowing the magistrate’s official seal as a talismanic token. With the talisman in hand, he invoked the **Arcade Star** (*Yùxīng*) to mark the magistrate’s native county, villages, ancestral temples, and the graves of his deceased parents and grandparents. He first summoned and bound the magistrate’s departed father and mother, sending them through the southern gate to be hung on the wall. The magistrate saw them, descended from his bed, and knelt in welcome.\n\nGen cursed the magistrate: 'I was born from your body, yet you, as an official, do not honor your parents. You should bring blessings to your deceased ancestors, but instead you dare to provoke the Daoist officers, ordering them to pursue and capture me here? Your life is in peril—quickly kneel and beg the Daoist officers for mercy, and I shall release you. If you do not, you will die instantly.' The magistrate repeatedly knelt and apologized to Gen, who then said: 'Go.' In a moment, both the magistrate and Gen vanished.

This teaching only discusses the sequential deployment of troops for striking and assaulting—it is not limited to a single army but encompasses all three armies.\n\nWhen finished, the Five Virtue Generals further assist in striking down Heavenly Demons. The matter is not trivial; one must sincerely uphold righteousness in heart and practice the Great Dao without flaw, thus achieving harmony of speech and intent.\n\nThe **Step of the Halter** commands the Three Generals of Dao Officials and Soldiers to lead first. When facing a great battle against enemy spirits and demons, all nine generals must be deployed—not just the three of Zhongyuan. Both Shangyuan and Xiayuan must also send their aides, as in *Han Hongtu*.\n\nGenerally, the three Zhongyuan Generals lead the charge, striking and assaulting first.

They are the fierce and righteous divine generals of the Dao.\n\nLater sages further refined *The Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl*, removing cumbersome passages and compiling it into fifteen volumes, along with thirty additional volumes of corrected prefaces, guiding disciples into the Daoist path of the Flowing Pearl and making the way easier for later seekers.\n\nGranted to Zhang Daoling, it clearly explains the use of the Flowing Pearl’s methods, also treasured in later scriptures.

The Celestial Master instructed King Jun in the Zhongyuan Upper Halter Step, which also includes the **Ding Halter Step** and the **Yǔ Step**—sometimes as the **Proper Halter**, sometimes as the **Ding Step**.\n\n*The Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl Canon* states that the two aides take fifty-five steps in the Halter, always deploying the General of Tang first, commanding three hundred million soldiers. With the left hand holding the golden talisman and the right hand wielding the bow’s sinew-shaking force, he seizes the fierce and malevolent demons and bandits with overwhelming might. The soldiers and officials then demolish the lairs of the malevolent ghosts and demons.\n\nTurning to face the Zhongyuan and Xiayuan Generals, he orders them to unite in purpose, swiftly converging upon the lair of the malevolent demon or bandit. Each exhales natural heavenly fire, burning the lair of the malevolent demon or bandit. There are also natural lions that devour the spirits and souls of the malevolent demons and bandits, preventing them from causing harm to humans or ourselves.\n\nThe General of Tang is then summoned, and immediately three hundred million officials and soldiers arrive, aligning their hearts with the two generals. Together, they encircle the distant encampments, temples, and dwellings of the malevolent demons and bandits.\n\nThe second-in-command to the General of Tang is General Ge, seventy-two *zhang* in height, wielding a spear in his right hand and a fist-shaking bow in his left. His sinew-shaking force is mighty and fierce, capable of shattering mountains. He arrives united in purpose with the General of Tang, attacking the malevolent demons and bandits in their dwellings and bodies. He also exhales natural heavenly fire, alongside lions, great serpents, and iron-clad soldiers marked with *seban* texts—fierce, poisonous, and savage. Wielding swords, they enter the lairs of the malevolent demons and bandits, exterminating each one without escape.\n\nThe lions and poisonous serpents also bite and devour the demons and bandits.\n\nThe third-in-command, General Zhou, governs the mind and spirit. Thus, *The Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl* records him as the first in command, mastering the expansive Dao and commanding the spirits. *(Annotation: This is the Celestial Master’s proclamation to the Twenty-Four Great True Persons of Xuanzhou, instructing them in the practice of stepping along the celestial and terrestrial Halter, each attaining true immortality. Through the heart’s command of the generals and soldiers, their merit accumulates, reaching three thousandfold, and through deep cultivation, they attain the Dao—all governed by the mind, hence the emphasis on the first.)*\n\nThis is for exorcising demons. According to the later sages’ instructions to Zhang Tian Shi and King Jun, General Zhou should lead the vanguard or rearguard and must not be exclusively ranked first.\n\nIf one seeks the Dao for longevity, the General of Tang should lead as first. If one seeks to cure illnesses or capture malevolent forces, General Zhou should lead as first, and success will follow. If one masters the Great Dao, the General of Tang should lead as first.\n\nGeneral Zhou, with his left hand holding the scepter and his right hand wielding the sinew-shaking bow force, arrives to seize and drive away the malevolent demons and bandits, following behind. This clarifies that he is the third in the General of Tang’s formation, as explained in the scriptures and prefaces.\n\nThe current interpretation follows the *Flowing Pearl* text as primary, governed by the heart’s intent and used in sequence. *(Annotation: This addition is from Zhao’s commentary, not the Celestial Master’s original Golden-Mouthed teachings.)*\n\nThe Celestial Master told King Jun: The Three Elements govern the Four Seasons—*(Annotation: Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter are the Four Seasons, corresponding to the divine entry into Taiyi, Lei Gong, and Liu Ren’s methods.)*—the Four Seasons *(Annotation: The gods of Heaven)* govern the Five Phases, the Five Phases govern the Six Jia, the Six Jia govern the Seven Stars, the Seven Stars govern the Eight Directions—*(Annotation: The Eight Directions in Heaven, the Eight Trigrams on Earth—Qian, Kun, Xun, Zhen, Kan, Gen, Dui, and Xian—all centered in the Middle Palace, invoking the Nine Palaces.)*—the Eight Directions govern the Nine Palaces, and the Nine Palaces generate the Ten Celestial Stems—*(Annotation: The current Ten Stems.)*—the Ten Stems generate the Twelve Earthly Branches, all arising from the natural *qi* of the Great Dao. When called upon, they respond and assist.\n\nWith a single-minded and refined intent, one attains profound understanding, securing the protection of the Three Elements and Five Phases. Through persistent cultivation, one achieves the Dao of longevity and eternal youth.\n\nI once transmitted this teaching to Shennong, who only understood the Three Elements but not the Six Jia. Though he lived over a hundred years without signs of aging, he later attained the method of *shīxiè* (corporeal ascension).",

      "translated_text": "---\n\nThe Dao of the Six Jia is known to me; one who can guard the spirit and regulate the body attains communion with the Three Elements. The Three Elements, when harnessed, can guard and save humanity. Regulating the body leads to communion with the True, and seizing the True of the Seven Stars grants mastery over ghosts and communion with spirits, establishing control over malevolent *qi*.\n\nThrough prolonged cultivation—*(Note: \"修\" refers to the method of measured steps and attuned clothing; \"求\" denotes the ritual techniques of exorcism, invocation, and talismans.)*—the immortal method is secured. The Daoist adept, Madame Fan, would, on the day of her birth, often perform exorcism rituals. Ten years later, the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper descended, teaching her the method of measured steps. Upon completion, she ascended in broad daylight. Only her old wedding garments remained, and the villagers buried them; to this day, people speak of the tomb of Fan and Liu’s ancient garments.\n\nThus, one attains longevity. All must first pass through the Three Elements and then the Seven Stars, relying upon them to begin practice. Knowing this, one becomes a Daoist adept.\n\nKeep it secret; do not recklessly impart it to others.\n\nTherefore, I begin with One, establish Two, command Three, harmonize Four, transform Five, don Five, command Six, point to Seven, and preserve Nine—the method of attaining immortality.\n\nI teach the Dao of entering the True and communing with the spirit, all achieved through the Three Elements Generals. The initial method is One: the *yuanqi* (original *qi*), the elder spirit within the body, thus named *yuanqi*, as One. *(Note: The spirit within the body is the \"神,\" residing in the *nìwán* (brain marrow). The \"太一\" is also this.)*\n\nOne has two categories: the first, external to the body, is Heaven—the spirit of the *Taiyi*. One can command the second, which is the Earth spirit. *(Note: The Earth spirit within the body is the spirit of the kidneys and spleen, also called the Dragon God’s commander, the *Dìzhuì*.)*\n\nThe second category, within the body, is the heart—the spirit of *Zhèngyī* (Upright One) can command the second, which is the spirit of the kidneys and spleen. Adding the left and right kidneys *(Note: Left kidney for men, right for women.)*—this is Three.\n\nThe method states: Two can command Three—namely, the Generals Tang, Ge, and Zhou. Three can subdue a hundred spirits, heal a hundred ailments, disperse a thousand calamities, and eliminate ten thousand poisons. *(Note: Poisons and malevolent afflictions of this kind.)*\n\nAll these methods are supreme; they are the workings of One *qi*.\n\nThe method of One begins with the principle of the first step, the \"One\" character, which governs the heart. *(Note: \"One\" refers to *yuanqi* (original *qi*), the brain spirit *Taiyi*, which enters the body and governs the heart.)*\n\nThe later sage-king said to Lord Wang: \"One spirit enters the Five Phases—this is the way. When the heart generates a thought, it is the principle of the method’s discipline and order. Once discipline and order are established, the hundred spirits respond, and nothing fails to succeed.\n\nBut if one speaks from the heart, invoking blessings or curses, the consequences of fortune or misfortune, guilt or virtue, arise with a single thought. The ancients honored One, keeping it undisturbed. Sit upon Two, making it inactive. Invest in Three, so that ten thousand soldiers guard my longevity, and no evil may act.\n\nThe heart commands all spirits; the Three Elements are the leaders, and the Six Jia are the assistants. One can command them. *(Note: Commanding and using them means guiding them to follow the Dao, without harming people or things; this is to make them beneficial, ensuring good deeds take root. Using them to harm is the accumulation of evil karmic deeds, which must not be done recklessly.)*\n\nOne can command and establish communion with the spirits, thereby achieving longevity. Three circuits complete, and then the discipline of the steps begins.\n\nLaozi said: \"If one wishes to command the Three Elements Generals, first preserve the spirits of *Taiyi*, *Tiānyī* (Heavenly One), and *Xīnyī* (Heart One). Then step the discipline of *Taiyi* and *Xīnyī*, attune the clothing, and issue the command according to the method, as if commanding soldiers.\n\nThe later sage-king told Zhang Daoling: 'You wish to seek longevity; you must practice the steps of *Taiyi*.' *(Note: The discipline of *Taiyi*.)* 'To attain immortality, preserve and enter the steps of *Tiānyī*.' *(Note: *Tiānyī* refers to the Upright One’s Three-Five steps of discipline, the method of preserving the spirit and measured steps.)* 'To swiftly ascend as an immortal, the *Xīnyī* must first arise, surpassing all other methods.' *(Note: When *Xīnyī* is preserved, it is within the body, arising from the heart.)*\n\n---\n\nFor those who cultivate the Supreme Dao, the heart must first generate a thought before all the Ones. The heart reigns over the body; once one knows the heart is the sovereign of cultivation, one practices the correct method before *Taiyi*, attaining the nature of *Zhèngyī*, and together with *Xīnyī*, they govern all immortals.\n\nThe heart must always be steadfast in the Three Ones, never losing the body, and thus attains the Dao of immortality.\n\nAgain, he told the Young Lord of the Eastern Sea: \"On the day of your birth, practice the steps of *Xīnyī*; on the *jiǎzǐ* day of Upper Element, practice the steps of *Taiyi*; on the *jiǎzǐ* day of Middle Element, and on the *jiǎzǐ* day of Lower Element, practice the steps of *Zhèngyī*. Often do this, and in nine years, the Dao of immortality will be complete; the Three Ones will be fulfilled.\n\nAgain, he told the Old Woman of the Western Mountain: *(Note: Some say this is the Fragrant Maiden.)* \"Practice the method of the Three Elements Generals: use General Tang as the leader during the *yín* hour, use General Ge as the leader during the *wǔ* hour and its aftermath, and use General Zhou as the leader during the *shēn* hour and beyond.\"",

      "translated_text": "---\n\n**Note:** *Xiaoziji* is a female immortal.\n\nIt is said: The **One Dipper** (*Yīdǒu*) completion is the **Kui Star**’s envoy. First, walk the **Earthly Measure** (*Dìjì*) and the **Celestial Dipper’s Ropes** (*Tiāngāng*), until the sequence reaches the **Three Generals’ Ropes**. When the **Three Ropes** are complete, then store the **Dipper’s Envoys** to strike and subdue. The scripture states: *\"First walk, then summon the North Dipper’s Seven Stars to seize and kill\"*—this is the **First Completion**.\n\nThen turn the fingers to point at objects, but do not yet rely on the mouth. One must practice diligently and grow thoroughly familiar through prolonged study.\n\nWhen the two methods yield results, the North Dipper follows, and whatever the mouth desires in intent, the fingers shall verify.\n\nThe **One Dipper** has its own diagram; store and visualize it for completion.\n\nWhen visualization is complete, recite the invocation:\n\n> *\"One Dipper complete, Three Five united,*\n> *Heaven reversed, Earth overturned,*\n> *Follow my commands as envoys.*\n> *As it is, so it shall be done—just as the law decrees.\"*\n\nThe **Two Dippers** completion is the envoy of the **□ Star**. Also, store the **One Dipper** completion, then proceed to the **Two Dippers** completion.\n\nWhen the envoys are stored within the body, the practice succeeds and one attains communion with spirits. The body can then awe and subdue objects, safeguard life, rescue and gather the lost, and achieve anything desired—this is called the **Two Stars’ Envoys’ Awe**.\n\nThe **Two Dippers** also have their own diagram; store and visualize it for completion, and it shall manifest.\n\nRecite the invocation:\n\n> *\"Two Dippers complete, Three Five enlightened,*\n> *Gather and subdue malevolent spirits,*\n> *Wickedness and evil shall submit in fear.*\n> *As it is, so it shall be done—just as the law decrees.\"*\n\nThe **Three Dippers** completion is the envoy of the **□ Star**. Also, store the **Two Dippers** completion, then proceed to the **Three Dippers** completion.\n\nWhen the envoys are stored within the body, its spiritual power gradually grows awe-inspiring. The **Three Manifestations** (*Sānyào*) radiate like light, and the form of the Dipper blazes upon the body. The **Three Dippers** also have their own diagram; store and visualize it for completion, and the envoys shall manifest in effect.\n\nRecite the invocation:\n\n> *\"Three Dippers complete,*\n> *Heaven and Earth purified,*\n> *The Dipper follows my body,*\n> *Those who see it shall flee in terror.*\n> *As it is, so it shall be done—just as the law decrees.\"*\n\nThe **Four Dippers** completion is the envoy of the **□ Star**. Also, store the **Three Dippers** completion, then proceed to the **Four Dippers** completion.\n\nWhen the envoys are summoned, the practitioner blazes with fire encircling the **Four Dippers**, assuming the Dipper’s form. Malevolent spirits and wickedness shall tremble, their hearts crushed and subjugated.\n\nThe **Four Dippers** also have their own diagram; store and visualize it for completion, and the envoys shall manifest in effect.\n\nRecite the invocation:\n\n> *\"Four Dippers complete,*\n> *Three Five full,*\n> *Traverse ten thousand miles,*\n> *Wind and fire shall not cease,*\n> *Slay and annihilate malevolent spirits,*\n> *Wickedness and evil dare not act.*\n> *As it is, so it shall be done—just as the law decrees.\"*\n\nThe **Five Dippers** completion is the envoy of the **□ Star**. Also, store the **Four Dippers** completion, then proceed to the **Five Dippers** completion.\n\nWhen the envoys are summoned, the practitioner’s **refined light** (*Guāngqì*) ascends to Heaven, assuming the Dipper’s form, its radiance illuminating the four quarters. Malevolent spirits and wickedness retreat a hundred miles, a hundred ailments vanish, and demons and malevolent forces are crushed and extinguished.\n\nThe **Five Dippers** also have their own diagram; store and visualize it for completion, and the envoys shall manifest in the Dipper’s form. The true image shines a thousand miles distant, spirits and gods submit in awe.\n\nRecite the invocation:\n\n> *\"Five Dippers complete,*\n> *The Five Phases arrayed,*\n> *The Five Metals rise like autumn clouds,*\n> *The Wooden Spirits are extinguished.*\n> **Note:** *Spirits* refers to the multitude of malevolent ghosts.\n> *The Five Woods flourish in spring, subduing the Earth Star.*\n> *The Five Waters flow and disperse, severing the Fire Phase.*\n> *The Five Fires blaze fiercely, the Five Metals dare not howl.*\n> *The Five Earths are purified and settled,*\n> *I and all things are born together.*\n> *As it is, so it shall be done—just as the law decrees.\"*\n\nThe **Six Dippers** completion is the envoy of the **□ Star**. Also, store the **Five Dippers** completion, then proceed to the **Six Dippers** completion.\n\nWhen the envoys are summoned, the practitioner’s refined light illuminates Heaven and Earth, radiating in the eight directions. Malevolent spirits and wickedness hide and vanish, while the body attains communion with spiritual *qi* (*Língqì*), its nature merging with the True Immortals. A hundred ghosts shall fear and respect, a thousand spirits shall guard and protect.\n\nThe **Six Dippers** also have their own diagram; store and visualize it for completion, and the envoys shall manifest in effect.\n\nRecite the invocation:\n\n> *\"Six Dippers complete,*\n> *Three Five move in concert,*\n> *Eliminate evil and wickedness,*\n> *Purify ten thousand miles.*\n> *I summon the Six Dippers and Six Hexagrams,*\n> *All united to guard my body and home,*\n> *Attaining eternal life.*\n> *As it is, so it shall be done—just as the law decrees.\"*\n\nThe **Seven Dippers** completion is the envoy of the **□ Star**. Also, store the **Six Dippers** completion, then proceed to the **Seven Dippers** completion.\n\nWhen the envoys are summoned, the practitioner encircles the **Seven Stars**, bearing the **Seven Dippers** upon their body, their radiance illuminating the ten directions. The body aligns with the North Dipper, and malevolent spirits are struck with awe. Auspicious omens follow the practitioner, ten thousand miles are purified, and countless guards attend.\n\nThere is also its own diagram; thus, the **Seven Dippers** envoys are fully stored. Now, when the seven stars are established, the envoys manifest instantly, responding at the heart and mouth like lightning illuminating the body. Store the Dipper’s completion power, and the spirits shall endure thus forever. When the envoys are stored, the body ascends to the **Upper Pure** (*Shàngqīng*).\n\nRecite the invocation:\n\n> *\"Seven Dippers complete the body,*\n> *United with the Six Hexagrams,*\n> *Drive and command the Three Elements,*\n> *Reverse and turn the Five Phases,*\n> *Enter the ranks of the immortals,*\n> *Walk with the Supreme Unity,*\n> *Dominate the Nine Heavens,*\n> *Purify the Nine Earths,*\n> *May my household all become immortals,*\n> *Every dwelling share in eternal life.*\n> *As it is, so it shall be done—just as the law decrees.\"*\n\n**Laozi** says: *\"The essence of the Six Hexagrams transforms into the Seven Stars.\"* The Seven Stars shift and move, overseeing and inspecting all spiritual beings.\n\n**Note:** *Spiritual beings* refers to humans, gods, dragons, beasts, spirits, and ghosts, etc. Those within Heaven and Earth who are born with spiritual vitality and divine communion are called *spiritual beings*.\n\nAll spiritual beings fear the North Dipper’s Seven Stars. Thus, those who study the Dao all know of the North Dipper’s Seven Stars and habitually store and contemplate them, donning them like garments. Though garments differ in quality, length, and style, they uniformly cover the body without fail.\n\nIf one desires that all spiritual beings fear and respect, and to secure one’s own longevity, then with the **One Dipper** to **Six Dippers** according to merit, the depth and magnitude of their efficacy shall not falter by a single measure.\n\nFor those who are beginners, they must diligently cultivate day and night, memorizing this method and storing it in thought. Do not lose the names of the stars, and always keep them firmly in mind.",

      "translated_text": "The Dao does not depart from the heart, nor does the heart need to depart from the Dao.\nWhen the two are inseparable, divine efficacy is established, and immortality is attained.\n\n**The Sixth and Seventh Scrolls of *Jin Suo Liu Zhu* (Golden Lock Flowing Pearl)**\n\nComposed by the Great True Ones of Zhonghua:\nZai Wang Fang Ping, Zhang Daoling, Zhao Sheng, Wang Chang, Si Ming, Li Zhongfu, Mao Ying, Xu Yu Fu, and others of successive generations.\nCommentary by the Daoist Immortal Li Chunfeng.\n\n**Explanation of the Upper Section: *Zhuan Shen Cun Yong Tu* (Diagram of Transforming the Body and Storing Its Use)**\n\nAll Daoist practitioners who diligently cultivate with earnest devotion—reciting scriptures, chanting the True, offering morning and evening incense, whether three times a day, six times a day, or twice a day—\nyet after ten years, twenty years, thirty years, or even their entire life, gain nothing, only to perish from old age or disease.\n\nSome abandon food and dwell in mountains, burning elixirs and refining medicines for years without divine response—what then can they rely upon?\nSuch disciples perish in great numbers.\n\nIf one does not grasp the true path, what foundation can they have?\nThose who rely solely on fasting, purity, and abandoning wife and child—whether Daoists or Buddhists—are even more numerous, yet none have prolonged life or extended their years, let alone ascended as dragons and phoenixes to become True Persons.\n\nNow, the Buddhist scriptures say:\n*\"What one cultivates in this life will be received in the next\"*—this is false.\n**Note:** The Buddhist scriptures claim, *\"What one cultivates in this life will be received in the next,\"* but this is incorrect.\n\nOur Great Dao does not even permit such thoughts. If kings and ministers seek to preserve their bodies eternally, why would they abandon the pride and wealth of this life to seek rewards in the next?\nThese words are utterly baseless and unworthy of trust.\n\nOne must seek the gate of the Supreme Dao and grasp its essential practice—realizing it in this life, becoming the Dao’s sovereign and minister. How could this not perfect body and heart?\nThe Dao is here, in this life. Body and heart must be cultivated together, attaining an indestructible form—how wondrous is this?\n\nThis is the explanation of cause and effect.\n**Note:** The Buddhist scriptures often speak of cause and effect, yet ignorant people—especially foolish women—are deceived into believing in karmic retribution and induced to make empty offerings. This is wrong.\n\nThe enlightened follow the Dao naturally, as heaven nurtures and earth sustains.\nSince heaven nurtures and earth sustains, water and fire first form the body, and when the body matures into humanity, it is again water and fire that bring about old age and death.\nThus, the origin of birth and death lies within the Three Realms, all governed by natural law, not by cultivation of seeds.\n**Note:** The Buddhist scriptures emphasize the cultivation of seeds, ignoring the teaching of natural law.\n\nYet true alignment with body and heart lies within the Dao. The seed of the Dao and its blessings reside in body and heart itself.\nAll internal cultivation is complete—external seeds are irrelevant.\n**Note:** True Persons cultivate body and heart, not earthen structures or temples.\nTrue Persons refine body and heart, not metals and stones.\nAll is governed by the natural teaching of the Dao.\n\nThus, the Supreme True Ones employ methods and incantations that never leave the body, yet their influence permeates heaven and earth.\n**Note:** This rejects the notion of grand diagrams.\n\nLater, the Sage Emperor instructed the young daughter of Xi Wangmu:\n*\"Though you were young and read little, you will serve others well when grown.\"*\nAfter several years, she saw someone reading the *Lao Jun Jing* and began learning the characters.\nOnce she recognized the script, she asked: *\"Do you know the names of the gods within the body?\"*\nHearing this, she was taught the method of *Zhuan Shen You Si Jie Xin Yin* (Transforming the Body, Silent Contemplation, and Sealing the Heart’s Seal).\n**Note:** This is the inner method of the *Liu Zhu* (Flowing Pearl).\n\nLater, with great spiritual power, she taught Xi Wangmu in return.\n**Note:** Initially, Xi Wangmu could only prolong life, ride dragons across heaven and earth, and summon them at will—but she could not herself master dragons, cranes, lions, or tigers.\nNow, by invoking clouds and dragons in thought, and summoning armies unseen, mother and daughter both attained it, and she is now called the Immortal King.\n\nAgain, she passed this down to the Heavenly Master, commanding him to refine his thoughts and combine the method of summoning.\nWhen the method was perfected, he became the central teacher of the Orthodox Dao, a celestial official akin to a great prefect, his status unassailable.\nHe must meditate once every hundred days.\n**Note:** To inspect and suppress malevolent spirits, ghosts, and evil *jing* (precise entities) that harm humanity.\n\nHe must store and apply the method once every ten days.\n**Note:** *\"Apply\"* means to contemplate and store the method, observing the world for malevolent *jing*, evil spirits, dragons, and ghosts that might harm humanity—or for poisonous *qi* disrupting humanity and the cosmos.\nHe must also fear that the sun and moon may dim, stars may cease their courses, winds and rains may fail, and spirits may deceive people.\nThese are the first concerns.\n\nThe second concern is self-cultivation: keeping the Three Souls and Seven Spirits aligned, ensuring *qi* flows correctly, and distinguishing essence and spirit—thus attaining longevity.\nLife is as depicted in the diagram: the sun and moon are clear, the stars shine within.\n**Note:** Store the Seven Stars so they enter and govern the five viscera, guarding the body’s spirits.\n\nOne may also assume the form of the Dao Father as depicted in the diagram—\nwhether in battle, in the wilderness, or in a grand sealed retreat—\nholding one’s breath, stepping in the Twelve Paces of Yu.\n**Note:** The Twelve Paces of Yu, four steps in twelve paces, correspond to the Twelve Branches and the Twelve Months. The Supreme Lord Lao transmitted this to Yu, who passed it to the world, calling it the *Yu Bu* (Yu’s Steps).\n\nWith the left hand, hold the Dao Father.\n**Note:** *\"Father\"* refers to the Yang. Men should use the left hand to grasp *Hu Qi* (Sudden Breath), and upon completion, contemplate it as a figure—\nwearing a lotus-crowned headdress, clad in purple robes—\ngradually rising until it stands before the heart, as if part of oneself.\n\nStore its height as one’s own: nine *zhang* tall, in purple robes, surrounded by soldiers bearing spears and halberds—\nthe Azure Dragon to the left, the White Tiger to the right, the Black Tortoise and Vermilion Bird arrayed in the five clouds.\n\nThen, with the right hand, trace:\nthe Ghost’s Eye,\nthe Spirit’s Eye,\nthe Tiger’s and Wolf’s Eyes,\nand the Evil Man’s Knife-Supporting Eye,\nmarking them all in red.",

      "translated_text": "Those who have seen and heard the **Manifestations of the Dao** attain communion with the divine, and the divine protect them as their guardians.\n\nThose who attain this method must first receive instruction from a **Clear Teacher** (明师). Only after being transmitted the **Scriptures, Laws, and Talismans** (经法箓) may they, after three years or two years, then be granted this method’s **secret formula**. This formula is transmitted orally, strictly following prescribed rites and measures. It cannot be hastily passed in batches of three or five volumes at once. Instead, unrelated matters must be discussed, and the transmission day must be broken into three or two separate sessions of oral instruction.\n\nFollowing the **precepts of past and future sages**, one cultivates the **Great Dao’s reverence for the Most Exalted Sovereign**. Knowing not to recklessly divulge the teachings, both master and disciple attain true immortality. How could this not be the master’s restraint in transmission and the disciple’s sincere resolve to receive it?\n\nTo seek the **Supreme Dao**, one must devote heart and soul, bowing in earnest and sincere petition—never casually requesting a teacher and expecting immediate instruction. In this world, ordinary teachers, yielding to human desires, recklessly transmit and lightly divulge the Dao’s methods.\n\n**Note:** In ancient times, great immortals would transmit the Scriptures, Laws, and Talismans, then require three thousand days of cultivation before passing on the essential **secret formulas**. This was to prevent people from forgetting their cultivation, for life is fleeting. Thus, they would petition for instruction and warnings, testing the disciple through three or five matters. Only if their resolve was unshaken, their aspiration for longevity genuine, and their desire to benefit the world sincere—without leaking the teachings to the unworthy—would they grant oral transmission.\n\nOriginally, this method was not recorded in writing, for those who seek the Dao often suffer from forgetfulness, and written records would go unmastered. The **Celestial Tribunals** of the **Three Officials** (三官) and the **Divine Sovereigns of Heaven, Earth, and Water** (天曹上帝道君及后圣君) were informed, lest true immortals and holy masters be disgraced. If the transmission is not passed orally, the disciple will not attain immortality. The blame falls upon the **Three Officials**, who would then harm and kill them. This is not because the unworthy rejected the formula, but because they lacked the path to cultivation, hence failing to become immortals.\n\nThus, the **Ancient Sage Laozi** commanded the **True Person Light Resonance** (光妙音) to compile and practice the **secret formulas**, integrating them into the Dao’s gate. He then structured **Fifteen Volumes** and transmitted them to **Mu Tianzi** and the **Sages**, opening the path to cultivation. In the prosperous era, when the **Later Sage Sovereign** (后圣君) was known, he ordered **Wang Fangping** to compile **Thirty Volumes**, transmitting them to the **Heavenly Hosts** and **Cavernous Heavens**.\n\nAmong those who left the world and received transmission were:\n**Zhang Tian Shi**, **Zhang Chongxu**, **Li Yanni**, **Li Shaojun**, **Li Babai**, **Li Jingyou**, **Li Fazhou**, **Li Changxian**, **Li Zhongfu**, the **three Teach brothers**, **Yuan Shaokang**, **True Yuanzi**, **Wei Zhongkuan**, **Zhu Shaoyang**, **Le Yi**, **Dongfang Shuo**, **Yin Xi**, **Xu Jia**, **Xu Cha**, **Xu Hui**, **Shi Jiazi**, **Jie Xiang**, **Li Buji**, and hundreds more—all who practiced this method and became **True Persons**, passing it down in succession.

Suddenly, a devoted seeker of the **Dao** appeared, but he did not meet a master. **Yuè** then suddenly communicated with him, agreeing to take him as a disciple. The seeker returned home, gathered gold and silk, and eagerly sought instruction. **Yuè** warned him, saying, *\"Your haste is a grave offense. The **Dao** first transmits the **fa** of the **luóshu** (scrolls), then imparts the secrets of the **ling** scriptures. You press too urgently—your guilt extends even to me.\"* Thus, he refused to instruct him. The man departed.\n\nLater, a divine being descended to inform **Yuè**, *\"You have mastered the **Dao**-heart profoundly; never reveal it lightly.\"* **Lǎozǐ**, the **Tàishàng**, spoke to **Huángdì**, saying: *\"When the mind is deeply focused and the body transformed, the **Dao**-command reaches all spirits.\"* **Note:** *To command all spirits means to follow the twelve steps of **yōusī zhuǎnshēn**—the pivoting of the body’s framework. This summons the spirits within the body: the **three souls and seven spirits**, the **five viscera and hundred vessels**, the **thousand tendons and myriad subtle essences**, ordering each to its proper station—**Zhèngdìng** and **Wáng**—to circulate **qi** and vitalize **fa**. When the **fa** is activated and prohibitions moved, it harmonizes with the spirits of **Heaven and Earth**, **Yin and Yang**, the **Sun, Moon, and stellar deities**, merging into one. Thus, on **Jiǎzǐ Days** or **Liùjiǎ Days**, in the first year, the **Dao**-spirits command armies. In the second year, they dispel a thousand poisons and subdue ten thousand soldiers.

Each passing year, your merit grows.\n\nPractice for one year and gain the **Five Spirits**. In two years, the **fa** is complete, and you become a **True Person**. In three or four years, the **Shàngqīng** will draw near, the **Yùnǚ** will descend in response, divine beings will appear, and all spirits will follow. Those who practice this **fa** will inevitably become **True**.\n\nLater, the **Sage Monarch** instructed the **Shàngyuán True Person Lǐ Fāngqī**, saying: *\"You wish to accumulate merit and receive divine summons.\"* **Note:** *The **kǎozhào fa**—healing one person’s illness counts as one merit. Three thousand people healed equal three thousand merits.* *\"To attain communion with the **yōu** (mystic depths), you must cultivate stillness and transform the body.\"* **Note:** *The steps of **bùgāng** require bodily transformation. When the ancients spoke of **zhuǎnshēn**, they referred to the modern **bùgāng**.* *\"To become **True**, quicken your steps and hasten your pace. If your **Dao**-practice is earnest and your body fails, yet your mind never ceases, you will still attain it. It is like practicing the **bù** steps—its efficacy is verified by its results.\"* **Note:** *The ancient **Xianren** all relied on mental cultivation.*\n\nWhen a person’s practice is profound and enduring, the **Dao** naturally imprints upon the mind. A single thought suffices—no difficulty remains. If you persistently uphold this practice, your descendants will inherit it, and your merit will extend to your six relations.\n\n---\n**Volume Seven of *Jīnsuǒ Liúzhū Yǐn***\n**Volume Eight of *Jīnsuǒ Liúzhū Yǐn***",

      "translated_text": "The surname **Pán**, given name **Tǐ**.\n\n*Note: The name of the ancient Upper Primordial General.*\n\nIn the age of the **Three Sovereigns**, the **Heavenly Sovereign**, the **Tàishàng Lǎojūn**—**Supreme Dao Lord**—as **Tàishàng Dàdàojūn**—**Supreme Lord of Ten Thousand Ways**—transferred the **Pán General** into the position of **Dàzhēnrén**—**Great True Person**.\n\nThus began the succession of the **Táng Duǎn**—**Tang Short**—as **Upper Primordial Upper Division Great General**, replacing the former.\n\n*Use the method of the original teacher before oneself.*\n\n*Note: If this method is transmitted, it may be preserved. If not transmitted, it must not be recklessly kept, lest it harm those who store it.*\n\nIn ancient times, the **Dìhuáng**—**Earthly Sovereign**—did not receive the reckless preservation of the Dao. Suddenly, the General appeared, his body nine hundred million *zhàng* in length. His voice like heavenly thunder, he called out to the Earthly Sovereign: *\"Earthly Son, who is your teacher? Why do you summon me?\"*\n\nThe Earthly Sovereign replied: *\"My teacher is the Five Spirits Lord.\"*\n\nThe General said: *\"Because you did not study under the Five Spirits Lord, if you had studied under the Lord, I would not have appeared. I now accuse you—what will you do? Bind yourself to him as your teacher! Bind yourself to receive the scriptures and methods. The Jade Registers are insufficient, the Golden Registers are entirely lacking. The oral transmission says: 'I received the Dao from the Eastern Xia Child. The Xia Child is your father. Though he lived, he transmitted the scriptures fully, never abridged. To claim you received the abbreviated Dao from Ling Mountain—what mountain is this? False words, false speech, will bring calamity upon your body. Give you three years to govern, then I will hold you accountable for your crimes.\"*\n\nThus, the Earthly Sovereign feared death day and night, ascending mountains and crossing waters to seek the Five Spirits Lord. When the Lord saw him, he knew he was being accused and said: *\"Great Sovereign, your adherence to the Dao is not sincere, your reviling of the Dao is not divine. Now you are punished by the Heavenly Officials—who is to blame?\"*\n\nThe Earthly Sovereign knelt twice before the Lord, declaring his guilt. *\"I am of base nature, fond of the Dao but my practice is insincere. I am a foolish man, now encountering a foolish artisan. I have recklessly cultivated, and the Heavenly Officials punish me. How dare I hope to retain my human form? I beg the Great Dao’s great mercy, to accept and command me, lest beyond three years the Heavenly Officials punish my crimes, and I lose my human form. How dare I still receive the Sovereign’s position?\"*\n\nThe Lord then transformed into a great divine method, closed his *qi*, and performed the *niǎnjué*—*muttered incantation*—which Westerners call *structuring the seal*. In an instant, the three generals—Táng, Lǐ, and Xú—descended together, acting as guarantors for the Earthly Sovereign. They transmitted the **Great Dao Golden Registers and Jade Talismans** in over eighty stages, the **Three Sovereigns’ Inner Texts**—*Heavenly, Earthly, and Human*—and forty-nine volumes of scriptures. After fourteen years of cultivation, he attained the Dao, governed the world for eighty-nine thousand years, and ascended to the **Xuánqiū Platform**.\n\nIn the presence of the original teacher, he performed the *niǎnjué* once more.\n\nHe then preserved the thought of the **Upper Primordial Upper Division Táng General**, surnamed **Táng**, named **Duǎn**.\n\n*Note: Call him softly.*\n\nThis deity is the **Tàiyī**—**Supreme Unity**—Emperor’s general. Do not call him recklessly. His body is nine hundred million *zhàng* in length. Below him is the **Five Halters Divine Functionary**, surnamed **Jiāng**, named **Dú**. His body is also nine hundred *zhàng* long. He commands a hundred thousand million layers of red-clad attendants—red-clad, with crimson headbands, holding golden talismans and wielding the **Lóngzhōu Sword**—leading a hundred thousand soldiers. Above the **thirty-two heavens**, at the **extreme of Tàiqīng**—**Supreme Clarity**—he oversees all the **heavenly lodges and star clusters**.\n\n*Note: The Supreme Lord told Pángǔ King: \"The heavenly lodges are the Twenty-Eight Constellations.

      "translated_text": "The **Supreme General of the Upper Primordial** is a celestial deity and great immortal official. Though he communicates with mortals, when humans, through sacred writs, register him within the left kidney, it is as though the human spirit and celestial deity resonate in harmony.\n\nThus, when the human spirit emerges, it ascends from the left kidney to the heavens above. The Supreme General of the Upper Primordial then descends through the **Heavenly Gate**, aligning with the human body. The human body likewise retains the brow as the form of the **Heavenly Gate**, like an inscribed petition with its diagram.\n\nThe **clustered clouds** revolve and descend, enveloping the body and household.\n\n*Note: The* Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl *omits these three characters. The Later Sage-King’s revelation to Fúqiū Gōng included them.*\n\nAs for those who cultivate the **Way**, after attaining it, they can benefit families, aid nations, and rescue people—how much more so if they can save the boundless worlds beyond their own body and household? If the body and household, or others, also attain it, in times of urgency, one may call upon the **Northern Dipper**, and it will descend immediately.\n\nWith the **coastal marshal**, *Note: The* Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl *omits the three characters \"元\" (Primordial), which appear in the Later Sage-King’s revelation,* one may dispel calamities and disasters, subdue spirits, dragons, and ghosts.\n\n*Note: These eight characters are also absent; they appear in the revelation.*\n\nThen, one turns the **Heavenly Pivot**, forms the **seal of the finger** with the hand, *Note: This is the \"twisting of the incantation.\" The incantation is hidden beneath the first fingernail of the left hand.* and with the right hand, twists it for a short while.\n\nOne takes **Yǔ’s Steps**—twelve strides, or nine. *Note: The Great Yǔ’s Step has nine strides; the Lesser Yǔ’s Step has twelve. This is the Later Sage-King’s distinction between the Great and Lesser Yǔ’s Steps. If the Most High Laozi speaks, the twelve-stride step is the Great Yǔ’s Step.*\n\nOne raises the **Heavenly Pivot**, pointing toward the direction of the malevolent force—*Note: This may be where soldiers or the sick reside, or where evil men and ghosts gather.*—and it vanishes instantly, faster than fire or water. *Note: This speaks to the swift response of the method, which can instantly manifest its efficacy. Calling without cause will bring ruin to oneself and one’s household.*\n\n*Note: The* Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl *lacks the three characters \"无事家\" (without cause, household); these are from the revelation, as cited above.*\n\nThe Most High Laozi told the Yellow Emperor:\n*\"If one’s body, household, and nation are at peace, recklessly invoking them will bring annihilation to one’s clan. Do not call upon them lightly.\"*\n\nThe **Golden Writ** states:\n*\"Lightly invoking the Northern Dipper and the Supreme General of the Upper Primordial will bring ruin to one’s body and spirit.\"*\n\nThe Most High Laozi further told **Ānhé Zǐ**—*Note: Ānhé Zǐ was the younger brother of Shénnóng, who studied the Way at Hángshān and encountered the Most High Laozi, who descended to teach him the Upper Clarity Three-Five Flying Steps of Heavenly Restraint and Earthly Measure.*—that one should always retain the essential incantation of the Three-Five, thereby summoning the Three Primordial spirits to descend and instruct in cultivation. By day, one ascends to the **Southern Extreme Fire World** of the heavens, refining gold and stone as the foundation of the earth, and declares:\n\n*\"Among the Three Primordials, the Supreme General of the Upper Primordial is the most noble and exalted—like the position of a sovereign emperor in the world. It is greatly capable of helping one attain the Way. When using it, one must not act recklessly. Only on one’s natal day, **Jiazi days**, or **Upper Primordial days**—*Note: Jiazi is the Upper Primordial; one must not act recklessly on Jiazi days outside of these specified occasions.*—should one cultivate and employ it. If suddenly there is an urgent matter in one’s body or household—being plotted against, a grave illness on the verge of death, or bandits—one may call upon it, and it will vanish instantly. This is highly efficacious. Even if not on these days, it will still work.*\n\nThe Later Sage-King told the **Celestial Master Dàolíng**:\n*\"You wish to teach others to escape calamity and enter the path of longevity. Take the **Upper Primordial day**—*Note: From the Jiazi cycle, select the Upper, Middle, or Lower Primordial days.*—of that person’s natal hour, day or night, and beneath the Northern Dipper, burn incense while focusing on one’s original teacher. Upon completion, visualize the Supreme General of the Upper Primordial descending into the **Níhuán Palace**, then entering the left kidney. Next, the Middle Primordial, then the Lower Primordial—*Note: The Middle Primordial enters the right kidney; the Lower Primordial enters the heart.*—first stopping the spirit at the Níhuán, then entering the heart and kidneys to stabilize the five viscera.\n\nThen, twist the incantation, take **Yǔ’s Steps**—four steps, twelve strides—and upon completion, visualize it emerging to envelop the body, like the **Encompassing Diagram**, fully encompassing the Three Primordials and Five Phases, the **Thunder Lord’s Five Thunders**, and the Eight Trigrams, sun, moon, and stars. When complete, recite the **Five Phases Eighteen Incantations** once to seek longevity. Within a year, one will enter the path of immortality. In two years, one will be named **Long-lived**, avoiding soldiers and escaping calamities, attaining spirit efficacy, moving heaven and earth by will, and achieving fulfillment of the heart. All will enter the Níhuán. Later, they will respectively enter the heart and kidneys. After a short while, when the body’s spirit is settled and still, one may summon it forth again, like the Encompassing Diagram. Upon completion, twist the incantation, close the **qi**, and take **Yǔ’s Steps**—twelve strides—to seek life and escape calamity. Within a year, the spiritual efficacy will manifest instantly, greatly aiding the **Heavenly Restraint and Earthly Measure**.\n\nYou must not recklessly transmit this to unworthy individuals. This method of the Three Primordials’ five techniques can directly lead one into the Great Way’s gate. Keep it secret for good fortune; reveal it for misfortune.*\n\nThe Most High Laozi told the **Three Primordial Deities of Antiquity**:\n*\"Cultivating the Three Primordials begins with the Upper Primordial’s natal day. Next is the Middle Primordial, then the Lower Primordial, completing the cycle. Within a year of cultivation, one may attain five degrees.* *Note: Within the sixty Jiazi days of the Upper Primordial, there is one natal degree. In the Jiazi days of the Middle Primordial, there are two natal degrees. In the Jiazi days of the Lower Primordial, there are three natal degrees. Following this cycle back to the Upper Primordial, one selects the natal day for practice. Within two years, ten days of cultivation will lead to the path of immortality.*\n\nThe Later Sage-King bestowed a **talisman of the Supreme General of the Upper Primordial** upon **Zhāng Dàolíng**, instructing him to swallow it. After swallowing, one should visualize its deployment—nothing will remain unfulfilled. He also commanded that it be passed down secretly among worthy disciples.\"",

It is the **Central Department General** (中部将军) who governs and commands the troops. When practicing, recite the **Step Framework** (步纲) three times, then pinch the **Central Department General’s Secret** (中部将军诀).\n**Note:** The Secret is found in the middle joint of the left hand’s first finger.\n\nThe first precept: Though the Central Department is the **Lord of the Upper Primordial** (上元主人), humans belong to the Central Department, which itself contains **Three Generals**.\n**Note:** These correspond to the **Upper, Middle, and Lower Primordials** (上中下三元).\n\nThis **Central Department General** can guide a person toward the **True Dao/Way of Immortality** (正仙道). On one’s **Middle Primordial natal day** (中元本命日), perform these sixteen precepts—these are the essential methods for all worldly applications, not merely the Step Framework.\n\n**First Method:**\nOn one’s **Middle Primordial natal day**, recite the **Central Department Li General Framework** (中部李将军纲) three times to stabilize the **True Spirit** (正魂) and subdue the **Ephemeral Soul** (魄).\n\nRecite:\n*\"Li General, enter my right kidney,\nGe General serves as your deputy.\nMay you grant me **Mysterious Longevity** (玄长生),\nLong life in this world,\nFearless and without dread.\"\n**Note:** The General is stored in the right kidney, preserved like an **Image Diagram** (含影图), seated and guarding the kidney.\n\nAfter reciting, strike the teeth twelve times, then pinch the **Central Department Secret** (中部诀).\n**Note:** The Secret is in the middle joint of the left hand’s first finger.\n\nPractice this method for one year, and **Mysterious Longevity** and prolonged vision will manifest. All hundred methods will verify its efficacy.\n\n**Second Method:**\nWhen facing **calamity, misfortune, or illness**, return to one’s **Middle Primordial natal day**. Begin from the **Five Torments of the Body** (自身五苦地), recite the Framework once, and exit the **Royal Constellation** (出王相).\n**Note:** The Royal Constellation is calculated in the **Five Phases divination** (上五行引中注).\n\nRecite:\n*\"From death to life,\n**Note:** In ritual texts and petitions, if the word *death* (死) appears in the upper line, the word *life* (生) must not align below it—this is taboo.\nEndless regeneration,\nAttaining the **Great Peace** (太平).\"*\n\nAfter completing the **Five Phases**, pinch the **Water-Fire-Earth Knife Supports** (水火土刀支) according to one’s **natal element**:\n- **Metal-natal** (金命) individuals pinch **Fire Knife Support** (火刀支),\n- **Wood-natal** (木命) individuals pinch **Metal Knife Support** (金刀支),\n- **Water-natal** (水命) individuals pinch **Earth Knife Support** (土刀支),\n- **Fire-natal** (火命) individuals pinch **Water Knife Support** (水刀支),\n- **Earth-natal** (土命) individuals pinch **Wood Knife Support** (木刀支).\n\nEach natal element has its own **Knife Supports** to break the **Five Torments, Eight Hardships, Nine Calamities, and Hundred Illnesses** (五苦八难九厄百病). Recite the Framework within the **Three-Five Methods** (三五法) to dissipate them. If misfortunes are not eliminated within a year, they will not prevail, and the practitioner will achieve **longevity**.\n\nThe **Five Knife Supports** are detailed in the **Palm Diagram** (掌图).\n\n**Third Method:**\nIf one’s **residence or courtyard is restless**, select a **Middle Primordial day of the Jiazi cycle** (中元甲子日), recite the Framework while circling the dwelling three times, or take **long strides** (长禹步)—the number of steps is irrelevant; completion of the circuit is paramount.\n\nAfter three circuits, recite:\n*\"The **Supreme Male** (乾尊) radiates with spirit,\nThe **Supreme Female** (坤) harmonizes within.\nThus it is.\" (云云).*\n\nAs recorded in *The Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl* (《金锁流珠》), within the **Upper Alley** (上巷), the dwelling will then stabilize.\n\n**Fourth Method:**\nIf **family members suffer illness** or the household is restless, select a **Middle Primordial day of Jiawu, Jiaxu, Gengshen, or Renyin** (中元甲午日、甲申、庚申、壬寅日). In the courtyard, recite the **Upper, Middle, and Lower Department Generals’ Frameworks** (上中下三部将军纲), one circuit each, then pinch the **Bright Hall Secret** (明堂诀).\n**Note:** The Secret is pinched on the second joint of the left hand’s second finger.\n\nSpit **saliva in the four directions**, storing the **Three Generals**—each commanding **three million soldiers**—to encircle the residence three times. Drive out **fire, water, lion, and serpent soldiers**, banishing **ghostly and demonic qi**, purifying the clear and dispelling the turbid.\n\nAfterward, inscribe a **Residence-Suppressing Talisman** (镇宅符) and affix it to the doors.\n**Note:** The Residence-Suppressing Talisman is found in the **Miscellaneous Talismans of the Three Departments** (三部杂符文).\n\nRecite:\n*\"The talisman subjugates a hundred ghosts,\nThe evil spirits are vanquished and suppressed.\nThe **Mysterious Tortoise** (玄武) ceases theft,\nThe **White Tiger**...

The practitioner will then **break through and escape**; pinch the **Knife Support Secret** (刀支诀) immediately.\n**Note:** The Secret is on the right side of the second joint of the left hand’s fifth finger. Pinch urgently until blood appears.\n\nUse this to align with the **Five Battles Garment** (五斗衣), pointing five times. Where pointed, the enemy will break. Then lead the troops to charge, and the enemy will collapse and retreat. Release the Knife Support immediately—otherwise, they will die.\n\nRecite:\n*\"From death to life,\nSwiftly ascending to the **Celestial Court** (天庭).\nThe **Azure Dragon** (青龙) supports my escape,\nThe **White Tiger** (白虎) guards my path.\nI am the **Celestial Envoy** (天使) of the **Celestial Pass** (天关),\nBreaking through your five armies.\n**Swiftly, swiftly break!** (急急急急急急破).\nAs the precepts decree.\" (急急如律令).\"",

While walking, no bandits or beasts will dare approach you—those that do will die.\n\n---\n\n**Seventh Method:** If a relative or Daoist associate in another prefecture falls ill—or if there is no barrier separating you—*i.e.*, parents, uncles, brothers, cousins, or even non-blood kin like Daoist friends or disciples (but not outsiders without righteous intent)—begin with the **Middle Section**.\n\n**Note:** The **Heavenly Halter** (天纲) is walked in the middle section first, then the Upper and Lower Sections, each three times. The **Celestial Sovereign** then instructs the **Heavenly Master**:\n*\"You must also tread the **Celestial Pass** (天关) and **Earthly Measure** (地纪), each once—or reverse and return three times. Then summon the **Middle Element’s Tang General** (唐将军), one figure, eighty-one *zhang* tall, with a red headband, a **Heaven-Piercing Crown**, a sword at his side, and a spear in hand, commanding a million troops. He proceeds to the sick person’s home, sets it ablaze to drive away ghosts, thrusts his sword into the door, and roars three to five times. Lions, dragons, and serpents enter the house—above the bed, below the bed, within the walls, before the door, behind the door, left and right—slaying all malevolent, poisonous, or afflicting spirits. Let the sand collapse and tiles shatter; let the deer flee a thousand *li*. Purge and exterminate all evil. When done, the illness will swiftly abate, and the enemy’s forces will be defeated. Report thus.\"*\n\n**Note:** Compose the ritual words and pinch the **Upper Element Secret**. Next, summon the **Middle Element’s Ge General** (葛将军), seventy-two *zhang* tall, with a red headband, a **Heaven-Piercing Crown**, a sword at his side, and a scepter in hand, commanding thirty million troops to the sick person’s home in such-and-such prefecture, county, village, and household. *Note:* Adjust according to the illness—fearing harm from malevolent ghosts or spirits. Burn the house with fire and water, drive away ghostly bandits, thrust the sword into the door, and roar three to five times, as before.\n\nNext, summon the **Middle Element’s Zhou General** (周将军), ninety-six *zhang* tall, with a red headband, a **Heaven-Piercing Crown**, a sword at his side, a scepter, and a talisman, commanding thirty million troops to the specified location. Proceed as before. Then pinch the **Secret**.\n\n**Note:** The **Secret** is on the first joint of the left hand’s thumb. Pinch urgently, and the three generals’ formation will fly to the sky, obscuring the sun. Upon arrival, they will slaughter poisonous and disease-causing ghosts and bandits. Follow the **Three Elements, Three Generals’ Method** as illustrated in *The Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl* (金锁流珠), using visualization.\n\n---\n**Eighth Method:** If you or your six relatives or Daoist associates are slandered, defamed, or plotted against, walk the **Heavenly Halter** and **Earthly Measure** once each. Then disperse your steps outward, leaving fifteen footprints in a wide arc. Walk the **Middle Element’s *Yubu* Steps** three times, then pinch the **Knife Support** of the offending person.\n\n**Note:** Pinch the **Knife Support** briefly—it will not harm the previous target. If pinched for too long, the person will weaken and die within ten or five days. Observe the signs carefully; do not harm others recklessly. Within a month or half, the matter will resolve as before.",

The **Supreme Venerable Lord** taught, also calling it the Central Dipper, commanding seekers of the Dao to know it themselves without instructing the ignorant masses. Thus, one may be removed from the **Death Register** and granted a **Heavenly Birth Name**. Keep it in mind and embody it:\n*Annotation:* Keep the names of the two august stars in mind, internalizing them into the five viscera, reciting them day and night without ceasing.\n\nThe **clothing** is formed by the **One Dipper and Two Dippers**. After fourteen years, one attains longevity. The **method** was transmitted to the Twenty-Nine True Persons:\n*\"On your natal day, or on days of the **Jiǎzǐ** (Gengshen) cycle—at dawn or dusk—\n*Annotation:* The best time is **midday** (upper), followed by **sì hour** (second), **yǒu hour** (mid), and **night hài hour** (upper), **zǐ hour** (middle), and **chǒu hour** (lower).\n—recite the **One Dipper and Two Dippers** fully. Then, through the **Seven Dippers** (missing characters), each recitation must be completed. Afterward, recite the **Earthly Records and Heavenly Halter Charms** once more, and the practice is finished. Those who attain this will have no calamities for one year, no death for two years, become an **Earthly Immortal** in three years, enter **Non-Death** in four, and by five years, their power will be thoroughly attuned to Heaven and Earth, enabling them to rescue beings according to their will. By six years, their **spiritual penetration and longevity** will be self-sufficient—this is the verified power. Do not act recklessly; secrecy brings fortune, while disclosure brings misfortune.\n*Annotation:* This is the **Supreme Later Sage’s True Speech instruction**; do not act rashly.\n\nThe **Supreme Venerable Lord** said:\n*\"When forming the **One Dipper and Two Dippers**, one must first grasp the original incantation of the seven stars, then internalize and embody them.\n*Annotation:* **Embodying** means keeping the Dipper’s leader or, at the proper time, using the **left shoulder as □**, or **□**, the **mind as □**, or the **hand as □**—this is called **embodying and applying**. Only when the Dipper is formed does it have divine efficacy, allowing one to send forth [spiritual agents].\n\nFrom the **One Dipper** to the **Seven Dippers**, all follow the original, correct incantation, which must be grasped and applied. The **first □ star’s incantation** is on the **second phalanx of the left second finger**. The **second □ star’s incantation** is on the **first phalanx of the left second finger**. The **third □ star’s incantation** is on the **first phalanx of the left third finger**. The **fourth □ star’s incantation** is on the **second phalanx of the left third finger**. The **fifth □ star’s incantation** is on the **second phalanx of the left fourth finger**. The **sixth □ star’s incantation** is on the **second phalanx of the left fifth finger**. The **seventh □ star’s incantation** is on the **first phalanx of the left fifth finger**.\n\nThe **Supreme Venerable Lord** said:\n*\"When forming the Dipper’s clothing, one must first know the seven stars’ original incantations. Only then can one internalize and embody them on the body, thus attaining spiritual communion. To make the Dipper’s power manifest, grasp this incantation, traversing all seven star-forms. Within the Dipper, the two august imperial stars, the three consorts, and the two ladies—along with the two beloved daughters and great officials—must be reverently honored. They register your **Heavenly Birth Name** above and remove you from the **Death Register** below.\n\nLater scholars, if they practice filial piety, reverence for their master, and offer gold, jade, and silk to the **master’s sacred chamber**, may request this incantation beneath the **precious seat**. Only then should they follow the *Liúzhū* [scroll] to internalize and apply it, thus entering the **Immortal Register** and having their names inscribed on the **Jade Ledger**.\n\nThe officials of the Northern Dipper, along with the **Record-Keepers and Registrars**, oversee the **Green Tablets of Destiny** and the **Black Registers of Sentences**. These are all achieved through Daoist power, using the **scribed incantations**. Once applied, the body and mind commune with the **Heavenly and Earthly Spirits**, and their spiritual power becomes effective. If one does not know this incantation, even if they follow the scripture for a hundred years, their practice will yield no benefit.\n\nWhen this method is obtained and applied, one understands its essence. In one year, they will attain spiritual communion; in two years, they will avoid death and warfare; in three years, they will become an **Immortal Official**. In fourteen years, if they wish to ascend, they ascend; if they wish to remain, they remain. The **Emperor of the Golden Summit of Great Peace** and the **Later Sage Emperor** will appoint them as **Worldly Immortal Officials**, commanding their departures and residences. This method must be kept secret—never transmit it to the unworthy. It is passed down only every seven hundred years, with each transmission limited to three persons. Beyond this, the master will face **Great Judgment**, descend from the **Immortal Rank**, and the disciple, if they steal and misuse it, will suffer **self-annihilation and clan destruction**. This is strictly forbidden.\n\nThe **Later Sage Emperor** instructed **Zhang the Heavenly Master**:\n*\"To practice the **Heavenly Halter and Dipper Clothing**, forming the sequence **One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven**, and using it to benefit oneself, aid the nation, stabilize the family, and rescue those in urgent distress from **war, epidemics, fire, and water calamities**, one must first know the **hand incantations**. This is the true power of attaining the Dao.\"*",

Once the* dou *is formed, swiftly pinch the incantation and point at them, then flee to a wider space where an ancient immortal might dwell. There, preserve the* dou *again to halt their killing intent. Then pinch the patterns of one star, two stars, up to seven stars—this suffices.\n\nWith urgency, align with the *Clothing of the Dipper*, using the left hand to preserve the *Kui* and *Wei* to subdue [them]. Stand firm and they will submit on their own. Rest for a short while, then depart swiftly. Later, in a wider place with few people, pinch the incantation, preserve the *dou* again, and the malevolent and demonic will retreat in fear, unwilling to leave—if they refuse, they will die. This method is highly effective; do not practice it recklessly—be cautious.\n\nFurthermore, the Sage instructed **Wang Jun**:\n*\"The incantation states: One* dou *preserves the soul, two* dou *preserve the spirit, three* dou *preserve the essence, four* dou *preserve the body.\n*Note: For grave crimes, trust in the method to act accordingly.*\nFive* dou *drink blood—\n*Note: Drinking blood is another name for the prohibitive incantation.*\nSix* dou *execute the spirit—\n*Note: This is another name for the judgment of one’s soul and spirit.*\nSeven* dou *halt the body.\n*Note: If halting does not work, it means beheading—halt is another name for beheading.*\n\nIt is also said: Those who constantly practice and refine themselves—preserving one* dou *stabilizes the soul, two* dou *refines the spirit, three* dou *harmonizes the essence,\n*Note: Essence is the refined substance of* qi*, the vital force of the form and meridians, moving through* qi*.*\nFour* dou *heals illness, five* dou *repels bandits and strengthens the body, six* dou *invokes divine spirits to protect, seven* dou *completes the Dao and attains divine communion. Practicing this for seven years grants the title of *Tian Zhen* [Celestial Purity].\n*Note: This means entering the rank of Tian Zhen, though one has not yet attained the method of ascending. After fourteen years, one ascends to heaven, receiving cloud dragons, phoenixes, cranes, music, and dancing. Immortal boys and girls, consorts, and guards—thousands and tens of thousands descend to welcome [them], or the entire family is lifted from their home to depart.*\n\n**Laozi** said: *\"Those who cultivate the Dao wish to have the North Dipper govern their lifespan and attain immortality. The incantation and method are found in the *Left Elbow Classic*.\n*Note: The Classic is the sacred text of the Daoist scriptures, containing the essential seals and incantation patterns. The talismans are used internally, and the secret method is kept in a short silk pouch tied to the elbow.*\n\nThe method of the *Heavenly Halter* is detailed in the Classic diagram.\n*Note: The Halter is the Heavenly Halter, the Memoir is the Earthly Memoir.*\n\n**Laozi** said: *\"Those who practice must always preserve the Dipper near their body. At night, meditate on the Dipper above the head, as if it envelops the body. By day, visualize it suspended over the forehead—a small, square *dou* of an inch.\n*Note: By day, visualize it hanging over the forehead, shifting with each hour. It is one inch long, then cycles downward in the center of the heavens, beside the *Yintang* [third eye], so that malevolent spirits see it and are constantly in awe, subduing their poisonous hearts.*\n\nRecite the invocation:\n*'Forehead-suspended Seven Stars—malevolent ghosts flee in terror.\nIf any dare to harm, they will be beheaded upon turning back.\nSwiftly, as the law commands.'*\n\n**Explanation of the Four-Dou Diagram Method**\n**Laozi** said: *\"The Four-Dou Diagram is the formation of four* dou *across the body.

The right side mirrors the left, each forming a* dou *shape.*\n\nAgain, reverse the preservation—counting upward from the left inner ankle as *Kui* to the seven stars suffices. This is the method of the Four-Dou.\n*Note: Laozi’s method calls the front* dou *the Yang Dipper, the back the Yin Dipper, with two Dipper formations on each side—thus, the Four-Dou. This Dipper dispels ten thousand calamities. The Four-Dou can eliminate the Four Killers, extinguishing malevolent disasters, warfare, ghosts, and demons, instantly dissolving them.\n*Note: Dissolving warfare and ghosts means subduing their malevolent influence.*\n\nThe Classic states: Seven* dou *dispel celestial calamities and the five departments of malevolent ghosts. Four* dou *dispel earthly disasters and killings, including the Year Pillar, Earthly Officials, and the four departments of hellish ghosts. Five* dou *can dispel the five phases—calamities of metal, water, wood, fire, and earth.\n\nAll are preserved in two ranks, subduing malevolent and wicked beings—\n*Note: Malevolent beings of the upper ranks.*\nFive armies, plagues, poisons, snakes, insects, and beasts. The incantation lies in the Five Knife Supports.\n*Note: The Five Knife Supports correspond to the metal, water, wood, fire, and earth phases, all contained within the palm incantation.*\n\n**Explanation of the Dipper-Clothing Alignment Method**\n**Laozi** said: *\"The Clothing of the Dipper is like wearing the Dipper as garments, with left and right sides—men use the left.\n*Note: Men begin with the left side, women with the right.*\n\nFor men practicing the Dipper-Clothing Alignment, first form the Four-Dou Diagram, then pinch the incantation,\n*Note: The General Supervisory Incantation.*\nAfter a short while, preserve [the star] □ on the left shoulder to the chest,\n*Note: Referring to the diagram, the left shoulder to the chest, near the nape, is called the chest-below-head, or more accurately, the axillary chamber.

My people must learn it together.’\nThus, the Hu King led his followers in three prostrations before Laozi, kneeling to ask: ‘My subjects, unprotected by Daoists, are all slain and devoured by the Heavenly Demon, my teacher.\nI now kneel to receive this method to repel these malevolent spirits and ghosts who prey on us.’\nAt this, Laozi imparted the Sleep-Dipper method. The Hu King cultivated it with unwavering focus, further requesting advanced Daoist teachings, eventually attaining true Buddhahood—all through the Sleep-Dipper method, gaining the Obscure Immortal [status].\n*Note: Obscure Immortal refers to Buddhahood.*\n\n**Sleep-Dipper Method**\nWith the right hand, cover the head and grasp □.\n□ resides at the left elbow, □ at the left chest—\nthe left side of the chest, specifically.\n□ resides in the heart, □ in the navel, with the right hand pressed over the navel.\n*Note: The navel must not receive the star’s qi directly, so the right hand covers it.*\nStore the star on the back of the hand as prescribed; practice this nightly while lying down, and eternal life will endure.\n□ resides at the left knee, □ at the left ankle’s inner malleolus.\nBoth sides are stored and invoked identically.\nAdditionally, the right side is used similarly: with the left hand’s □, store □ at the right shoulder, □ in the chest, □ in the heart, proceeding in the same manner.\nFor external coverage of the body, the left side begins with the Foot-Kua star, extending upward to the head.\nNext, arrange □, □, □, □, □, □, □—the seven □ stars’ sequence.\nThe right side begins with the Head-Kua star, extending downward to the foot.\n*Note: This follows the same principle as above.*\n\n**Explanation of the Sitting-Clothing Alignment Storage Method Diagram**\nLaozi said: Sitting-Clothing Alignment involves calculating and storing the Dipper stars on both sides.»",

In total, over thirty individuals attained the Dao [得道者计三十余人], achieving longevity [得长生], or the methods of corpse dissolution [尸解之道], or the immortals dwelling in cave palaces [洞府之仙]. Only Zhao Rui’s seventh-generation descendant [赵升] ascended as a Celestial Immortal [天仙], rising in broad daylight [白日] with his entire household [拔宅], all lifted together [俱随身举].\n\nWhen it came to Sun Rui [孙芮], he was skilled in restraining *qi* [炁禁], but his excessive unlawful slaughter of ghosts and spirits [非法杀害鬼神太多] incurred the wrath of the condemned immortals [被谪仙], who decreed him to serve as a scribe in the Bureau of Examinations [考召书吏]. *注：today’s bureaucratic officials.*\n\nTwo thousand years later, he would finally attain the rank of Great Immortal [大仙]. *注：According to the *Nine Provinces Geographical Record* [九州地纪], the Western Mountain was once part of the ancient Jingzhou [古荆州], which is today’s Western Mountain, known as Hongzhou [洪州].*\n\n**Ascension by Household Removal [拔宅] to the Celestial Palace [上升天宫]**\nThe Most High Venerable Lord [太上老君] declared: *\"I received the primordial Dao’s true speech [元始真言] and orthodox teachings [正法], and the Most High Dao Lord [太上道君] vouched for my ascension. Through my mastery of subduing Heavenly Demons [天魔] and Earthly Spirits [地灵], I was able to achieve my body’s transformation and rise in daylight [白日上升]. Only by ascending alone [唯一身而上游] could I pay homage to the Celestial Lords [谒诸天] and worship the Most High Dao Lord [朝拜太上道君]. Afterward, I was permitted to worship the Primordial Heavenly Venerable One [元始天尊], yet I still could not attain ascension by household removal [不得拔宅上升].\"*\n\nNow, I have, with unwavering resolve [志心] and focused meditation [精思], compiled the sacred texts and secret keys [秘诀] of various Daoist teachings [众法经文], as well as the hidden scriptures and true speech of the Celestial Lords [诸天隐文真言]. Through this, I have grasped the essence of the Most High’s Golden Talisman [太上金箓之要], extracted from the myriad scriptures [众文中撰出], and achieved ascension by household removal [拔宅], whereby my entire family—men, women, and all—attained the Dao [得道], and even chickens and dogs ascended together [鸡犬一时俱升] to the Cloud Celestial [云天]. From that point onward, I began to manifest ascension by household removal.\n\n*注：Before this, there were no recorded instances of ascension by household removal. Those who prepared and ingested the elixir [将作药成服] would rise to the Cloud Celestial, their entire household lifted, even chickens and dogs attaining the same fate.*\n\nThe practice of ascension by household removal [拔宅上升] originated with the Most High Venerable Lord [太上老君]. *注：Before this, there were no recorded instances of ascension by household removal. Those who now attain it [今时得者] are quite common [往往有之], all practicing this method, numbering tens of households [计数十家], already present in the Celestial Courts [见在上天].*\n\nFamilies such as Li, Wang, Zhang, Xu, Peng, and Han [李王张许彭韩等数家] all ascended by household removal [俱以拔宅].

Later, he established the Broad Benevolence Daoist Hall [拔广慈道场], where over a hundred rooms of his residence ascended together [宅院一百余间屋俱升]. Today, it is the Purple Micro Celestial Palace [紫微上宫], the former residence of the Later Sage Lord [后圣君旧宅].\n\nThe Later Sage Lord further bestowed upon his servants, chickens, and dogs [更添奴婢鸡犬], granting them ascension as well. *注：This is the Later Sage Lord’s vast compassion and profound mercy [大慈大悲]. His blessings extend to those who have accumulated great merit and achieved profound attainments [恩流赐言功，功大积着多者]. Thus, he permits even their wives, children, disciples, servants, chickens, and dogs [及妻子子弟子奴婢鸡犬] to ascend together [同得俱升].*\n\nThe orthodox method of ascension by household removal [拔宅正法] was revealed to the Five Emperors [告五帝]. *注：The Five Emperors [五帝] are the Five Great Celestial Lords of the directions [五方大帝君].

The Later Sage-King knew this, so he established the Dwelling-Uprooting Divine Method, naming it the Four Fixations, to repel misfortune and avert disaster. No calamity dares to encroach. The great Dao’s divine power, the rectified Fixation’s force, uproots the dwelling.

The spirits are arrayed in ranks, awaiting the day the residence’s master ascends, following the Original Master’s commands.\n**Note:** According to the *Canon of the Orthodox Dao*, when one attains the Dao, it is because the Original Master’s disciple naturally reveres the teacher. The Master, in the void, knows the disciple’s filial heart. On the day of attainment, the **Most High** dispatches an envoy to welcome them, leading them to pay respects to the officials, observing proper greetings and bows before announcing their ascent to a celestial abode.\n\nThe generals float above the residence, entering the **Five Clouds**, the Earth Axis and Earth Locks rolling with the land, ascending with the master without difficulty.

      "translated_text": "Now, the **Zhenren** of the Central Kingdom, the Great Immortal Master, **Zaiwang Fangping**, **Zhang Daoling**, **Zhao Sheng**, **Wang Chang**, **Li Zhongfu**, **Mao Ying**, **Xu Yufu**, and others, are those who composed this in succession. The **Immortal Master Li Chunfeng** annotated it.\n\nThe **Five Phases** and **Six Seasons** give rise to the following:\n\nThe **Taishang Lao君 (Laozi)** said to the **Taiji Zhenren** (True Person of the Supreme Ultimate):\n\n*\"The Dao generates **One**,\n**Note:** **One** refers to Heaven.\nThe **Taiyi** (Great Unity) Spirit, named the **Qi** of the **Taiyang** (Great Sun), emits the **Taiyang**’s radiant essence, condensing into the Sun.\nThe **Qi** of the Sun descends and unites with **Yin** below.\n**One** generates **Two**,\n**Note:** **Two** refers to Earth.\nThe **Qi** of **Yin**, ascending, forms the Moon. The **Qi** of the Moon merges below with **Yang**, thus the **Yin** and **Yang** **Qi** intermingle, condensing into sentient beings who dwell between Heaven and Earth—known as the **Three Talents** (San Cai).\n**Two** generates **Three**,\n**Note:** **Three** refers to Humanity.\nOnce there is Humanity, there arise the four seasons—**Cold, Heat, Spring, Autumn**—in cyclical rotation, endlessly recurring, giving birth to the **Four Heavenly Kings** (Sijian Sishen, Sifu).\nThis doctrine comes from the *Thunder King’s Rituals* (Leigong Shì), a record by the **Yellow Emperor** (Huangdi), applied to the four seasons, producing the **Four Pillars** (Sifu).\nEach **Pillar** governs a direction, issuing commands—these are **Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter**.\nCalled the **Four Heavenly Kings**, they harmonize with the **Four Rituals** (Sishi), overseeing the **Four Pillars** (Sifu).\n\n**Three** generates the **Four Seasons**, as previously annotated.\nThe **Four Seasons** generate the **Five Phases**,\n**Note:** The **Five Phases** are what follows.\nThe **Five Phases** generate the **Six Jia** (Lujia), the **Six Jia** generate the **Seven Stars** (Qixing), the **Seven Stars** generate the **Eight Trigrams** (Bagua), the **Eight Trigrams** generate the **Nine Essences** (Jiujing), the **Nine Essences** generate the **Ten Celestial Stems** (Shiganzhen), the **Ten Celestial Stems** generate the **Twelve Earthly Branches** (Shierzhixiang), the **Twelve Earthly Branches** generate the **Twenty-Eight Constellations** (Ershibaxiu), and the **Twenty-Eight Constellations** generate the **Five Luminaries and Thirty-Six Official Stars** (Wudou Sanshi Liu Guanxing). The **Five Luminaries** and **Thirty-Six Official Stars** generate the **Three Filths and Five Official Stars** (Sanwu Wuguanxing), which in turn produce the **Circulating Heavens of Ten Thousand Phenomena** (Zhoutian Wanshang), and the **Circulating Heavens** generate the **Boundless** (Wuqiong).\n\nThe **Five Phases** are thus generated. Named **Metal, Water, Wood, Fire, Earth**, they are the **Five Stars** (Wuxing).\nWhen a mortal’s life begins, they are assigned the **Five Phases**, thus receiving their fate.\nThey also follow the **Five Phases**, determining their rise and decline.\n**Note:** *For those who study the Dao, always observe that Metal and Wood oppose each other—I do not endure opposition. Metal generates Water—I follow accordingly. Water extinguishes Fire—I do not endure extinction. Fire generates Wood—I flourish and thrive. If the Five Phases do not harm me, I seek eternal life.*\n\nThe **Five** (Wu) are manifest in Heaven’s **Five Stars**, humanity’s **Five Viscera** (Wuzang), and Earth’s **Five Mountains** (Wuyue)—the **Three Fives** (Sanwu).\n\n**One** is the sovereign of all **Dao**, the origin of all Spirits, encompassing the vast without exclusion, containing the minute without omission.\n**Note:** **One** is said to permeate even the finest details, encompassing the greatest breadth—thus it is.\n\nHence, it can both generate and extinguish mortals.\n**Note:** *When the Five Phases support each other, they generate. When they oppose each other, they extinguish.*\nAll that mortals generate are governed by the **Five Phases**.\n\nFor instance, a person born under the **Eastern Wood Phase** (Mingming) with **Hai** (亥) as their **Pillar** (Fufu), generates **Water**,\n**Note:** *Water can float Wood, and Earth can nourish Wood. A Wood Phase fate receiving the Qi of these two stars is auspicious.*\nand **Fire** can burn Wood, making them a **Great King** (Dawang).\n**Metal** opposes Wood—Wood fears **Metal**.\nThey generate **Earth**,\n**Note:** *Though Wood opposes Earth, Earth can also sustain Wood. Wood remains unharmed while generating the auspicious symbol of a king—thus, wearing an Earth Phase talisman is fortunate.*\nand they generate **Fire**.\n**Note:** *Fire and Wood unite—though Wood is consumed by Fire, its Qi of transformation and assimilation remains unharmed, and it attains greatness as a king. It is fitting to wear a Fire Phase talisman to seek wealth.*\nYet they fear **Metal**.\n**Note:** *Metal opposes Wood.*\n\nIn the **Jiazi** (甲子) cycle, there are sixty days when **Metal** opposes **Wood**—these are:\n**Jiazi** (甲子), **Jiawu** (甲午), **Renyin** (壬寅), **Xinhao** (辛亥), **Renshen** (壬申), **Guiyou** (癸酉).\nThese six days are the ones in question.\nIf one practices as usual, on **Dingmao** (丁卯) Fire Days, inscribe the talisman of the **Yinghuo Star King** (Yinghuo Xingjun) and wear it. Replace the talisman every sixty days.\n\nFor those born under the **Fire Phase** (Mingming), using **Yin** (寅) as their **Pillar**, they generate **Wood**,\n**Note:** *Wood nourishes Fire, and Earth sustains Fire. One might also say Water can extinguish Fire—Fire thus fears Water.*\nand wear **Earth** talismans on long straps to subdue it, achieving longevity.\nThey generate **Metal**,\n**Note:** *Though Fire melts Metal, it also refines and transmutes it into vessels—thus the way of mutual transformation.*\nand their kingship lies in **Wood** and **Earth**.\n**Note:** *Fire attains kingship through Wood and finds stability through Earth. Thus, wear Wood talismans for kingship and Earth talismans to stabilize the spirit.*\n\nYet they fear **Water**.\n**Note:** *Water extinguishes Fire.*\n\nThus, those born under the **Fire Phase** are few, and their **Pillars** are often weak, with many afflictions, calamities, and encounters with ghosts and demons—this is because **Water** can extinguish **Fire**. Among the **Four Pillars**, only **Water** and **Fire** are said to mutually extinguish. One must invest in the Dao early in life.\nWear talismans of **Earth** and **Wood** to subdue the **Fire** within, thus attaining bodily peace and spiritual protection.\nAdditionally, chant the names of the **Earth** and **Wood** stars’ essences aloud—guard the body of this humble servant, repelling the calamitous **Water** star’s long essence. Command it to depart from this humble servant’s spirit and body, from the **Three Souls** (Sanhun) and **Seven Spirits** (Qipo), and remain two thousand *li* away, never to interfere again.\n\nInscribe **Wood** talismans on Fire Days and **Earth** talismans on Metal Days, and wear them perpetually—auspicious.\n\nFor those born under the **Metal Phase** (Mingming), using **Yi** (巳) as their **Pillar**, they generate **Earth**,\n**Note:** *This is not the true Earth Phase; Yi borrows the position of Chen (辰), Chen being the true Earth.*\nand **Yi** is the true Fire Phase.\nFire opposes Metal, which is not the Metal’s true origin.\nIn ancient times, the great immortals thus shifted their palaces to borrow positions, taking Chen twice—this is because the seasonal spirits do not properly receive their generated phases, and one must again push the true position to Yi.\nYi belongs to Fire, hence it is taken as the generated phase.\nYet always contemplate the **Earth** star—wear talismans of **Earth** and **Fire** together, never letting them oppose each other, but instead generating and transforming each other—thus achieving kingship.\nThey transform through **Wood** and **Fire**,\n**Note:** *Though Fire opposes Metal, it also refines and transmutes it into vessels.*",

      "translated_text": "The **Sage’s correct intent** states: *\"A slight initial misfortune will be followed by lasting good fortune.\"*\n\nAgain, Metal can subdue Wood, and Wood can generate Fire. Fire cannot arise without Wood, so it is said that **Wood and Fire** generate each other and can thus subdue Metal.\n\n**Metal-born individuals** must employ **Water and Earth** stars and planets, shifting and turning to subdue and harmonize. Therefore, each night when one sleeps, they should always preserve the **Earth star** and **Water spirit** to protect their body, with the **Wood spirit** before them and the **Fire spirit** behind them, constantly guarding them. They should also wear talismans of **Earth and Fire** upon themselves, so that they may always generate and transform each other, never opposing or harming one another.\n\nLater, the **Sage of the Later Age** instructed **Chisongzi** (赤松子): *\"You are a Metal-born individual. Your origin lies in **Yi** (已), which belongs to the Fire Phase, and within that Phase, you must always endure. This is because being of that Phase, it is naturally harmful to your body. You can take **Chen** (辰) as your borrowed palace, for the Earth Phase belongs to Metal, ensuring lasting good fortune. Also, wear talismans of **Wood and Water** to suppress any harmful **qi** (炁), for it will naturally dissipate and vanish. The **qi** that rules is **Water**,*\n**Note:** *Water can generate Metal, hence it is taken as the ruling **qi**.*\n\n*always wear talismans of the **Water star**, placing them upon your head, for lasting good fortune. The **qi** you fear is **Fire**.*\n**Note:** *If Fire acts alone to subdue Metal, Metal will suffer harm. If Water comes before Fire, Fire cannot subdue Metal. Hence, for those seeking Metal’s salvation, Water is the answer.*\n\n**Metal-born individuals** should always, at night, contemplate the **Water spirit**, visualizing it upon their body, beside them, and within the tent around them, keeping it ever-present as though seen. The **Fire star** and **Chen** essence will not dare to approach, ensuring that one will never be harmed throughout their life. With practice, they will achieve their desired outcome, and when their merit is complete, they will ascend during daylight.\n\nLater, the **Sage of the Later Age** told the **Celestial Master** (天师): *\"It is not only that Metal-born individuals fear Fire; all five types of individuals have mutual subduing and annihilation. They all depend on this Metal-born calculation to find their generating **qi**, teaching future generations. Though Metal fears Fire, it is refined and cast into form through Fire’s tempering, and supported by Water, it naturally attains firmness and integrity—such as the use of blackened Metal as vessels. This is the Metal of the five colors.\"*\n**Note:** *Gold, silver, iron, copper, and tin are the five Metals.*\n\n*All must follow the great principles to attain their true forms. For **Water-born** and **Earth-born** individuals, their generating palace is **Shen** (申), and they generate Metal.*\n**Note:** *Metal, here, refers to the **Western Metal Phase** (西方金). The native Phase of Water and Earth.*\n\n*Though Water and Earth generate the five Metals, it is not the five Metals that generate from Water and Earth. What is meant by \"generating Metal\" is that the **Western Metal Phase** (庚辛之地) belongs to the Metal Phase, and thus the **Water and Earth stars**, being of the **Greater Yin** (太阴) **qi**, form into the shapes of Water and Earth—this is their native Phase belonging to Metal.

They ascended in clouds of purple **qi**, adorned with five-hued floating silks, until the instruction concluded, and suddenly vanished from sight.*\n\n*Thus, the **Supreme Masters of the Way** knelt and rose to speak: \"Our humble minds are dim and unenlightened.

You must draw near to the **Three Celestial Platforms** and distance yourself from the **Five Phases**.*—*The **Five Phases** of the **Zhou** are the enemies that harm the body, while the **Three Celestial Platforms** are the divine protectors of the soul and spirit. To distance oneself from the **Five Phases** is to practice the **Dao’s** methods of isolation, while to draw near is to preserve the **Three Combinations** of life.*\n\n*By storing the spirit to guard the body and severing the **Five Phases’** harm, you will avoid the peril of death. Even if you slightly align with the **True Person’s Dao**, you may transmit this method, instructing disciples to become **True Persons** of the future.*\n\n*You must tread the **Seven Stars of the Earth’s Measure**—*the **Great Dipper** born from **Yu’s Step**—*and regulate the **Five Phases**.*—*The **Seven Stars of the Earth’s Measure** are the **Great Dipper**, and the **Five Phases** are the **Great Golden Talisman’s** robes, found in the **Upper Scroll of the Flowing Pearl’s** Step Halter.*\n\n*You must ascend the **Three Celestial Platforms**.*—*Though treading the **Seven Stars of the Earth’s Measure** does not require the **Three Celestial Platforms’ Step**, you must perform the **Three Steps of the Three Celestial Platforms**—each step containing three traces, nine traces in total, known as **Yu’s Step**.*—*This is the **Way’s** teaching to **Xuanyu**, hence its name. It is the essence of **Yu’s Step**, with three steps and nine traces.*\n\n*You must enter the **Heavenly Gate**.*—*For those who aspire to the **Way**, first they must align their hearts, sit in stillness within an empty chamber, and tread the **Seven Stars of the Earth’s Measure** seven times.

The Grand Sovereign of All-Perfect Daoist Masters of the Chinese Realm—including Fāng-píng, Zhāng Dàolíng, Zhào Shēng, Wáng Cháng, Sī-mìng, Lǐ Zhòngfǔ, Máoyíng, Xǔ Yùfǔ, and others—were commissioned to author this. The Daoist Master Lǐ Chúnfēng of the Chinese Realm annotated it. The Five Phases and Six Periods [of time] that generate [these stars] are detailed within.*\n\n太上老君告太极真人 徐来勒是也。\n*The Most High Lǎojūn instructs the Primordial Daoist Master [Tàijí Zhēnrén], and this is the method of Xú Lǎilè.*\n\n曰：五命之中，唯火命帝王则吉，似衰则病。\n*He says: Among the Five Celestial Mandates, only those born under the Fire Mandate as sovereigns are auspicious; if they appear to decline, then illness comes.*\n\n注：按《五星论》云：火命入小年多忧病，及长大时，忽不称意亦病，长助王时即吉。\n*Note: According to the Treatise on the Five Stars, those born under the Fire Mandate suffer anxiety and illness during their early years, and when they grow older, sudden discontent also brings illness. Only when they assist the sovereign in their prime do they flourish.*\n\n上仙皆用此法，转令常王盛。\n*The Celestial Masters all employ this method to transform their fate, ensuring the sovereign remains ever prosperous.*\n\n吾今说此妙法授卿，令卿常王，不衰不病也。\n*I now impart this wondrous method to you, so that you may always reign as sovereign, without decline or illness.*\n\n卿可常用庚寅、辛卯木日，可作小坛子，\n*You may frequently utilize days of the Gēngyín (Jupiter-Wood) and Xīnmào (Wood) commands, and construct a small altar,*\n\n注：按《五行相成记》云：夫醮祭作坛，须向用日前，先结土为坛，三级，高一尺五寸，古仙为之也。\n*Note: According to the Records of the Five Phases’ Mutual Generation, when conducting a ritual (jiào) to establish an altar, it must face the day’s cardinal direction. First, form the altar with earth in three tiers, standing one foot and five inches tall—this is how ancient Daoist Masters did it.*\n\n今志人修求，以黄土布地为坛，佳也。\n*Now, those who seek spiritual cultivation may spread yellow earth upon the ground as an altar, which is excellent.*\n\n此是作一时之用。\n*This is for temporary use.*\n\n但於净室空院之中，用黄色土乾筛，过布地为坛，祭醮为上。\n*However, within a pure chamber or empty courtyard, use yellow earth that has been sifted and dried, spread evenly upon the ground to form the altar. Rituals (jiào) conducted here are superior.*\n\n如不要，却扫除之，不妨。\n*If you do not wish to use it, simply sweep it away—it causes no hindrance.*\n\n高一尺五寸。\n*Note: The altar’s height should be visualized as one foot and five inches.*\n\n注：令人心存坛高一尺五寸，用得。\n*Note: Visualizing the altar’s height as one foot and five inches is effective.*\n\n用酒五升，或五斗。\n*Note: Use five sheng of wine for small rituals (jiào), or five dou for grand ones.*\n\n注：夫大醮五斗，小醮只五升，或三斗。\n*Note: For grand rituals (jiào), five dou of wine are used; for small ones, five sheng—or even three dou.*\n\n醮脯 脯用鹿脯，鸿鹭脯也。\n*Offerings of dried meat (fǔ) for the ritual (jiào): use dried venison or dried meat of the wild goose or egret.*\n\n一斤，五盘饼果，\n*One jin [of dried meat], five round cakes of grains or fruits,*\n\n三果及时新物等。\n*three fresh seasonal fruits, and other timely offerings.*\n\n酒杯一十五，\n*Fifteen wine cups,*\n\n席六领。\n*and six ritual mats (xí).*\n\n五方五领一领按前。\n*For the five directions, use one mat each, as previously described.*\n\n菜二十五楪，\n*Twenty-five dishes of vegetables (cài),*\n\n酒蹲一坐，\n*a single wine stand (jiǔdūn),*\n\n褥铺设如法。\n*and bedding arranged according to the ritual method.*\n\n画岁星君，带之左肘后。\n*Draw the image of the Star of the Year (Suìxīng), and wear it on your left elbow.*\n\n祭醮岁星君，以王火之意也。\n*The ritual (jiào) for the Star of the Year aims to reignite the Fire Mandate’s power.*\n\n然五君总请，俱会於坛，\n*Now, summon all five celestial lords—they will gather at the altar,*\n\n此即请客迎宾，共作福力之意是也。\n*which signifies inviting guests and benefactors to collaborate in generating auspicious power (fúlì).*\n\n须作启请王相辞文，读所请五星。\n*You must compose an invocation (qǐqǐng) and ritual address (xiàngcí) to the Five Stars, then recite them.*\n\n从岁星起。\n*Note: Begin with the Star of the Year.*\n\n注：文在下醮祭引中具说讫。\n*Note: The text is fully explained in the subsequent ritual (jiào) invocation.*\n\n一画岁星君一人，与青童一人，及木符三道，同袋系之於肘后。\n*Draw one image of the Star of the Year and one of the Green Boy (Qīngtóng), along with three Wood talismans (fú), and bind them together in a pouch on your elbow.*\n\n一云：香木为之，长一二寸，戴安头，\n*Some say: fashion these from fragrant wood, one to two inches long, and wear them on your head—*\n\n此谓之戴王入相，盛之无穷。\n*this is called \"wearing the Sovereign’s talisman to enter the celestial phase,\" bringing boundless prosperity.*\n\n注：香笺沈木堪，余木不可也。\n*Note: Only fragrant wood like sandalwood (shēnmù) or aromatic paper (xiāngjiàn) is suitable; other woods are not.*\n\n有人用金银为之戴头，且此即不入，\n*Some use gold or silver to craft these talismans and wear them on their heads, but this method does not work—*\n\n相成王盛，为火克金，\n*for when the talismans align with the sovereign’s power, it is because Fire overcomes Metal (Jin),*\n\n此入相克也。\n*but this is the opposite of what we seek: the talisman’s power being overcome.*\n\n异域香木及香不入中华，用者不堪，\n*Fragrant woods and incense from foreign lands do not belong in the Chinese realm; those who use them are unworthy—*\n\n犯道禁。\n*for they violate Daoist prohibitions.*\n\n注：夫大道中华正教，天地神仙之言，我中国神仙之乡人，\n*Note: The Great Dao of the orthodox Chinese teaching is the discourse of Heaven and Earth, gods and immortals. We, the people of the Chinese realm, are the native land of divine immortals—*\n\n不合夷戎蛮狄之宝，为神仙之器。\n*we should not use treasures from barbarians, as they are not suitable for the tools of gods and immortals.*\n\n不合烧异域熏臭秽毒烈辛之香。\n*Nor should we burn incense from foreign lands that is pungent, foul, or poisonous.*\n\n此香犯道禁，又非真人常修行之香也。\n*Such incense violates Daoist prohibitions and is not the kind that true immortals (Zhēnrén) habitually use.*\n\n真人爱紫微幽木之炁，笺沈之木，\n*True immortals cherish the subtle *qi* of the Purple Enclosure (Zǐwēi) and fragrant woods like sandalwood (shēnmù) and aromatic paper (xiāngjiàn)—*\n\n闻之皆喜。\n*they take joy in their scent.*\n\n胡狄之香，故皆恶。\n*Incense from barbarian lands is therefore all evil.*\n\n闻其炁，上真为之辛烈毒恶之炁也。\n*When one inhales its *qi*, even the highest immortals find it harsh, poisonous, and malevolent.*\n\n王桐栢谓王子登曰：苏上卿爱烧辛烈之炁，冲於中华天尊形象之前。\n*Wáng Tóngbì said to Wáng Zǐdēng: \"Sū Shàngqīng loves to burn pungent, harsh *qi*, which clashes with the divine image of the Chinese Celestial Sovereign (Tiānzūn) before him.*\n\n地府奏上，太上大恶之，\n*The Underworld reported this to the Most High, who greatly abhorred it,*\n\n退仙一等，\n*demoting the immortals one rank,*\n\n减位阶。\n*and reducing their celestial stations.*\n\n又长令掌西国陀佛台，永不离胡身，\n*Furthermore, he eternally commanded them to oversee the Ertao Platform (Tó Fó Tái) in the Western Realm, never to leave their barbarian forms,*\n\n胡地仙人也。\n*making them immortals of barbarian lands.*\n\n卿可能依此之法，\n*You can follow this very method,*\n\n十年位为真人，\n*and within ten years, attain the rank of true immortal (Zhēnrén),*\n\n一生无衰病之时也。\n*never to experience decline or illness in your lifetime.*\n\n徐君依行。\n*Xú Jūn followed this practice.*\n\n以笺香沈香为岁星，\n*Using aromatic paper (xiāngjiàn) and sandalwood (shēnmù) to fashion the Star of the Year, one inch long,*\n\n及镇星君、青童君三身，\n*along with the images of the Lord of the Constellation (Zhènxīng) and the Green Boy (Qīngtóng), three figures in total, each one inch long,*\n\n各长一寸，\n*each one inch long,*\n\n以锦袋盛之，\n*and stored in a brocade pouch,*\n\n戴头上，\n*to be worn upon the head,*\n\n五年并思存如见。\n*for five years, while also meditating upon them as if they were present.*\n\n三君为之，\n*The three lords (Zhènxīng, Suìxīng, and Qīngtóng) accomplished this,*\n\n下化为老人，\n*and transformed into an elderly man,*\n\n告徐君曰：公以身坚体王，\n*who told Xú Jūn: \"Your body is now firm and your sovereign’s power is fortified,*\n\n万邪不敢干也。\n*so that no ten thousand malevolent forces dare to approach you.\"*\n\n卿可能转乾坤於指足，\n*You can thus manipulate the Heavenly Circulation (Qiánkūn) through your fingers and toes,*\n\n转乾坤，是飞天纲，\n*for manipulating the Heavenly Circulation is the celestial law of flying through the skies,*\n\n蹑地纪是也。\n*and the earthly law of walking upon the ground.*\n\n指是掌诀，\n*The fingers are the key to the palm techniques,*\n\n皆在指节足，\n*all of which reside in the joints of the fingers and toes,*\n\n自身左右脚，\n*and the natural alignment of your left and right feet,*\n\n足步钢蹑纪是也。\n*for the steps of your feet are the iron-clad earthly laws.*\n\n纳三六於心胸，\n*Internalize the Three and Six within your chest—*\n\n注：三是三元将军，皆能纳入人身。\n*Note: The \"Three\" refers to the Three Primordial Generals (Sānyuán Jiāngjūn), who can all be internalized into the body.*\n\n六是老君六甲符，\n*The \"Six\" are the Six Talismans of the Celestial Mandates (Liújiǎ Fú) of Lǎojūn.*\n\n修行吞符，一十四年真人也。\n*Through cultivation and swallowing these talismans, one becomes a true immortal (Zhēnrén) in fourteen years.*\n\n如此十年，\n*Thus, within ten years,*\n\n白日升举为大仙真人也。\n*you will ascend in broad daylight to become a great Daoist immortal (Dàxiān Zhēnrén).*\n\n君初闻不识，\n*When you first hear this, you may not understand,*\n\n及其日久，\n*but as time passes,*\n\n渐有悟知。\n*you will gradually gain insight and comprehension.*\n\n为之八年，\n*After practicing for eight years,*\n\n白日上登太极，\n*you will ascend in broad daylight to the Primordial Dao (Tàijí),*\n\n仍传数弟子，\n*and also impart this knowledge to several disciples,*\n\n不转乾坤也。\n*though they will not manipulate the Heavenly Circulation.*\n\n犹数百岁，\n*Yet even they will live for hundreds of years,*\n\n后隐於山，\n*and afterward, retreat into the mountains,*\n\n而绝世也。\n*and vanish from the world.*\n\n土星被木星来害我本命生位宿者。\n*If the Earth Star is harmed by the Wood Star, or if the Wood Star attacks your native celestial mandate and birth position,*\n\n注：土虽居中位。\n*Note: Though the Earth Star occupies the central position,*\n\n为戊己而无正位，\n*it lacks a fixed position for the days of Wù and Jǐ (Earth days),*\n\n寄王在四季，\n*and instead, its

The Five Stars will escort them, ascending the White Day to the Chen, entering the court of the Jade Pure, and receiving the scriptures to become an Upper Pure True Person.**\n\n**The Five Phases (Wu Xing) generate and transform all things, each in its own way.**\n\n*Note: All things are born from the Five Phases, and they also return to the Five Phases—this is the forward and backward cycle.*\n\n**Those who enter the Communion of Spirits (Tong Ling) can also maintain their essence, govern and stabilize the human body, hence the transmission of their names.**\n\n*Note: The later sages passed down to Master Yin, who composed the *Five Phases Talisman Record* and left it in writing. The following is the text of that work.*\n\n**The *Five Phases Talisman Record* of Master Yin states:**\n**The Metal (Jin) Phase begins first,**\n*Note: The classics originally placed the Wood Phase first, but the later sages, following the Celestial Master’s *Flying Heaven Regulations*, established the order as Metal, Water, Wood, Fire, Earth—hence the order is not altered here.*\n\n**though in reality, the Wood Phase precedes it. Metal is the Tai Bai Star, which disperses downward to form the Metal Phase. The Metal Phase, capable of transforming essence and spirit, condenses the Yang Qi of the Tai Bai to generate the human form.**\n\n*Note: Yang Qi of the Tai Bai congeals to form humans.*\n\n**The Yin Qi of the Metal Phase generates the human form. This is the meaning of \"Shang\" (商). Shang refers to humans. Once humans are born, they naturally take the surname Shang. Having this surname, they then marry with descendants of the Yu (羽) surname and produce six sons. The eldest son resumes the ancestral surname Jin. Jin’s descendants cross the Eastern Sea to become the ruling class of a nation. The second son takes the surname Yin, a branch of the Jin surname. The third son takes the surname Xia, not the ancestor of today’s Xia clan, but the original character for \"upper and lower.\" The fourth son takes the surname Jiang, which is the Jiang of today. The fifth son takes the surname Zhang, the ancestor of today’s Zhang clan. The sixth son takes the surname Lang, the ancestor of today’s Hu and Kang clans. Over time, as the years pass, none have truly received this transmission.**\n\n**Even in the Han Dynasty, when Jing Fang expounded the Five Phases’ laws, he redefined the Five Surnames, yet it is unclear whether his arrangement was accurate.**\n\n**If one takes the original *Qi* (炁), the differences are certain. If one’s black *Qi* aligns with the surname, and they ingest Metal in accordance with its prescribed regimen, they will gain the benefits of prolonged youth and longevity.**\n\n**The *Record of Master Ma* states:**\n**Though the Metal Elixir Method involves refining Metal into liquid, it is not as effective as consuming its powder. The powder, when combined with water, is even more potent.**\n\n**These three methods have distinct scriptures, which are found in the *Upper Pure Sacred Scriptures*.**\n\n**Those who consume White Metal, Silver, or Lead will all align with their original surnames, and the methods will bring benefits. If they do not align, the methods will be ineffective.**\n\n**The Silver Powder Method, which involves consuming silver as Silver Ointment, is all based on silver. The methods are detailed in the *Upper Pure Sacred Scriptures*.**\n\n**Moreover, the method of subduing Lead as the *Purple River Cart* (紫河车法) is divine and mysterious, and is recorded in the *Inner Secrets of the Great Alchemy Talisman Scripture*—it is not further detailed here.**\n\n**The method of subduing Copper as the *Purple Powder, Purple Flower, Light Snow Elixir* is found in the *Sacred Scriptures of the Great Dragon-Tiger Talisman*.**\n\n**The method of subduing the Five Metals—Silver, Copper, Iron, Lead, etc.—as the *Return to Ancestry Method*, which returns to the original Metal (Jin), uses the method of refining Copper and Iron into gold, as recorded in the *Sacred Scriptures of the Great Dragon-Tiger Talisman*—this is not further detailed here.**\n\n**The method of refining Iron into *Divine Treasure Instruments*—swords, mirrors, tripods, and cauldrons—is found in the *Sacred Scriptures of the Treasure Sword Record*.**\n\n**Shang (商) refers to humans, as explained earlier.

Upon ingesting it, he attained an age of three hundred years without death, his appearance resembling that of a man in his forties. The Emperor then inquired why he had not yet ascended to become an immortal of the heavens.\n\nHuai-chang replied: *\"Though I was young and sought guidance, I had no master to follow. I searched all the famous mountains, even reaching the southern Flaming Continent, where the mountains of Bao-cang and Tian-tai—once called Bao-cang—lie.

The Five Metals* [五金], *when reversed, become the Six Bandits* [六贼], *and within the Five Viscera* [内五藏], *they cause emptiness, failing to guard the soul and spirit, as the bandits dwell within. One may ingest* *Yue Jing* [月精, moon essence] *and* *Tu Ying* [土之英, earth’s refined essence], *which are the* *Yingzhi* [英芝, elixir herbs]. *This comes from the wisdom of the immortals who drink water. Later, one may apply this to nurturing life.\"*\n\nThe *Nine Star System* [九星] begins with the *Wood Star* of the *Heavenly Court* [天庭], and those who practice early and diligently achieve success. The father of the nine sons was named *Xian* [先], with the surname *Jiao* [角]. *Jiao Xian* [角先] had two wives. The first wife bore nine sons, each taking their own surnames as noted before. The second wife also bore nine sons, but they did not separate and collectively retained the surname *Jiao* [角]. Today, according to the ninefold divisions of the eastern realm, they are known as the *Jiu Jiu* [九九, ninety-nine] lineage. The nine sons from each wife, scattered across the eastern seas or within them, are all descendants of the *Sui Xing*’s dispersion.\n\nThose who practice the *Dao* [Way] must understand the great efficacy of the *Wood Star*’s transformations. They should know that the realm where the *Jiu Jiu* [二九子] descendants reside is ruled by *Wood*’s *Huang* [皇, sovereign] *Fire* [火]. The *Wood Star* benefits those with the *Four Commands* [四命], especially the *Fire Command* [火命]—those who align with it achieve the highest success. Thus, *Fire* and *Wood* mutually reign: *Fire* is born from *Wood*, and *Wood*’s nature thrives in growth, finding harmony with *Fire*, so it naturally follows *Jin* [金] in strength. **Note:** *Jin* [金] overcomes *Wood* [木], so if one seeks *Wood* below, it will be attained. Next, those with the *Fire Command* [火命] receive blessings. Among the *Five Commands* [五命], only *Tu* [土] slightly fears *Wood* [木]. If one aligns with humanity’s expansive nature, then fear arises. However, within the *Five Star Palaces* [五星宫], they do not oppose each other—how much less so their star sovereigns! **Note:** The Five Stars often gather in the mortal realm to drink wine, yet they do not harm humanity, as the world knows. Their opposition lies only in the essence of their stars. Due to the inherent natures of *Jin* [金], *Wood* [木], *Water* [水], *Fire* [火], and *Earth* [土], and humanity’s ability to craft ritual methods and utilize them, there is no longer opposition between *Water* and *Fire*. Roughly, *Wood*’s nature is kind in seeking and receiving, so those who practice know this.\n\nThus, after the *Winter Solstice* [冬至] and before the *Establishment of Spring* [立春], one selects an auspicious day to sacrifice to the *Wood Star Sovereign* [木星君] first, then inviting the remaining five sovereigns in total. If practiced for five years, the star sovereign descends, receiving the *Wood Star’s* elixir herb—*Muzhi Yingzhi* [木英之芝]—growing in the courtyard. By eight years, the five sovereigns collectively descend with divine omens into the son’s dwelling. By fourteen years, the five sovereigns descend to welcome the son at the *Five Capitals* [五都], where he ascends the *Five-Colored Cloud Platforms* [五色霄台]. **Note:** The *Eastern Platform* [东青玉之台] of the *Jade Clouds*, the *Western Platform* [西向玉之台], the *Southern Platform* [南丹陵玉之台], the *Northern Platform* [北黑霄玉之台], and the *Central Platform* [中黄金玉之台]—each platform corresponds to its direction, with the *Eastern Platform* having nine days of observation, and the others following similarly. The *Jade Clouds*’ *Platforms of the Five Colors* [五色霄台] are where the immortals’ music is heard. Sacrificing to the *Wood Star Sovereign* [木君], if one attains success, it is due to the alignment with this method. The primary day is the *native day of the command* [本命日]. If that is not available, then *Gengyin* [庚寅] or *Renmao* [辛卯] days will suffice. For those with the *Earth Command* [土命], these days are not used; instead, *Jia-yin* [甲寅], *Yi-mao* [乙卯], *Wu-yin* [戊寅], *Geng-zi* [庚子], or *Ren-chou* [辛丑] days are chosen, as auspicious. One must use fifteen *leads* [席] of the *Sacrificial Array* [领], along with incense, flowers, lamps, and candles of seasonal fruits, or offerings of food and drink—all must be solemn and pure to invite the true descent of divine omens. **Note:** The *Fifteen Leads* [三五一十五] correspond to the *Fifteen Star Sovereigns* [十五君官精], collectively inviting them in one session, forming a *Fifteen-Array Platform* [十五盘]. Alternatively, there may be thirty-five platforms. **Note:** If one adds three platforms for the *Three Primordial Generals* [三元将军], six platforms for the *Six Celestial Stems* [六甲], three platforms for the *Six Memorial Generals* [六纪将军], one platform for the *Pillar of Heaven Great General* [柱天大将军], seven platforms for the *Nineteen Star Sovereigns* [十九星大众] and *Twenty-Eight Constellations* [二十八宿], and three platforms for the *Three Platform Star Sovereigns* [三台众星], *Nine Wilds* [九野], and all star officials, generals, officers, soldiers—then the total is eighty-one platforms. The *Sacrificial Array* [菜楪] must be set accordingly, as in a *fasting ritual* [斋楪].",

The **Five Phases** [9] and **Six Periods** [10] produce the **Way’s Essence** below.

Moreover, all the **Key Secrets of True Personhood** [15] and their **High Dao**, their most guarded mysteries lie in the **twisting of the fingers**, the **attunement of the ritual robes**, the **rotation of the Dipper**, and the **pointing to Heaven** [16]. Those who can **fly through clouds and traverse rain**, who can **uproot and snap trees**—these are **Dragons** [17]. Aspirants who obtain these **wondrous Dao Secrets**—if they merely perform the **Stepping Flight** [18],—\n*Note: Stepping Flight refers to the **A-yu Step** [19].*\n\n—the **A-yu Step** [20], **twelve years** of practice, **attunement of the ritual robes**, the **twisting of the Dragon Secrets**, and the **rotation of the Heavenly Lock** [21]—will cause the target to fall dead at their touch. Though they can strike down, they must not act recklessly. Reckless action will forfeit one’s **Sage position**. Knowing this, one should not act.\n\nIf one were to act recklessly against another person, merely to play with one’s power for a moment, one would not realize that the **Dragon** [22] bears no guilt while the target dies, and the blame would instead fall upon oneself and even implicate one’s **Teacher** [23]. One must **carefully examine** and **not act** without necessity. If an enemy comes to harm you and you cannot evade them, then you may use this method, but **quickly resolve the matter** afterward.\n*Note: The Later Sage Emperor bestows this secret only to those who aspire to the Dao, to safeguard their lives and families. This method of **Left Suppression, Right Release**—*\n*Note: Suppression refers to twisting the fingers of the left hand; Release refers to twisting the fingers of the right hand. The Later Sage Emperor taught the Celestial Master [24] the method of Left Suppression and Right Release, which can be used endlessly.*\n\n—is the **Refining of the River Vehicle** [25]. **Master Zhang Shaozhen** obtained the teachings of **Laozi, the Celestial Lord** [26], and was able to **delay his lifespan for a thousand years**, serving as a **pillar of stability for the mortal realm** and warding off calamities. Later, he did not ascend to Heaven, fearing the **Five Viscera** [27] might decay and disperse. He then employed **200 catties of green lead** [28].\n*Note: Excessive mercury is called **cup lead**; impure cinnabar is called **grind lead**, and both are unfit for use. Only the **I-yang** [29] and **Persian** [30] varieties are acceptable, with **purple cinnabar** being superior. This is highly potent.*\n\nHe placed **one inverted moon iron cauldron** [31] to the right, measuring the lead according to the cauldron’s size, and roasted it with **fierce fire**. When the lead had fully melted, he **stirred it thoroughly to the bottom**. In a short while, it would naturally turn into **green sand** [32]. Initially, when the fire was lit, the lead would sometimes form **green sand**, and sometimes fail to change. One must **stir continuously without pause**, and stop only when all has transformed. If the fire cools, the lead will revert to its original state.\n\nIf one wishes to **forcefully transform the lead into yellow flowers** [33], after the lead becomes **green sand**, one must **not extinguish the fierce fire**, but stir it continuously, and it will immediately turn into **yellow flowers of lead** [34]. Then, placing the **green sand** in a basin, one **gradually adds bitter wine** [35] and **refines it with a pestle**, using **sugar and vinegar**. If one does not use **strong, concentrated wine**, the **green sand** will become **fine, clear powder**. When finished, one **dries it on tiles** under the sun. After a short while, one **gently warms it with a low flame**, takes **imperial river sediment powder** [36], and **mixes it with the left flavor** [37]. Without this method, the **pill** cannot be formed. The lead, once dried, is placed into a **cast-iron pot**, covered above and below, and **roasted with fierce fire**. Using a **leather bag to pound the lead**, it flows through the **cast-iron channel**, and the **green sand** will immediately transform. One places a **cast-iron vessel** below to collect it, taking all until it is exhausted.\n\nIts color is **bright white**, named **Lead Grandson** [38]. After **eight reversals and nine rotations**, it turns **purple**. For every **catty of lead**, after **nine rotations**, it consumes **15 catties and 1 ounce**, yielding **1 ounce**. This is called **Jin Gong Dan** [39]—**Strong Lead Elixir** [40]. It is also known as **Purple River Vehicle**, **Golden Dog**, **Nine-Rotation Treasure**, and **Nine-One-Rotation Lead Essence**. Its uses are manifold.\n\nOther accounts are found in the *Upper Clarity Spirit Book* and the *Dragon-Tiger Rectified Talismans*.\n\nThe **Eastern Wood Star Sovereign** instructed **True Person of the Supreme Ultimate**, **Master Jie Ziliang** [41], saying: *\"When the apricot kernels are ripe, mix them with their skins and flesh, leaving them in a dry place. If the place is damp, use a **wooden tray** to contain them. Wait until the skins and flesh naturally dry up, until early autumn. Then, **cut two sharp, pointed holes** into them. When the **kernel is exposed**, roast it with **gentle fire**—when it makes a **hissing sound**, the **gold** emerges. Use a **bamboo knife** to collect it. A **round, one-inch piece** yields **one catty**, and it is used to make **A-yu Golden Elixir** [42].*\n*Note: The elixir is recorded in the *Upper Clarity Spirit Book*, which states that **yellow flower gold** is the true substance.

If one **recklessly applies talismans near the Four Gateway Gods** [近於四門之神],—**Heaven’s Gate** [天門], **Human’s Gate** [人門], **Earth’s Portal** [地戶], and **Ghost’s Portal** [鬼戶]—**they shall never bind such talismans to the Four Gateway Years** [切不得纲加四門].\n\nIf the **Application Year falls within the Four Minor Years** [四孟], such as **Yin** [寅], **Shen** [申], **Wei** [巳], and **Hai** [亥], then **one must not bind talismans to these Four Minor Years** [纲即不加四孟行年]. If it falls within the **Four Central Years** [四仲], such as **Zi** [子], **Wu** [午], **Mao** [卯], and **You** [酉], then **one must not bind talismans to these Four Central Years** [纲不加四仲行年]. If it falls within the **Four Seasonal Years** [四季], such as **Chen** [辰], **Xu** [戌], **Chou** [丑], and **Wei** [未], then **one must not bind talismans to these Four Seasonal Years** [纲不加四季行年].\n\n**Note:** If there are **urgent matters** [有急事], then **twist the Talisman Supervisor’s Incantation** [捻都監誥], **digging the time** [堑時] on the **10th or 5th day** [十日五曰]. If there are **no pressing affairs** [事無], then **quickly resolve it** [即急解之], and **success shall follow** [即得]. If there are **sudden and dire emergencies** [更有急卒], and **one has not yet obtained resolution** [未得解者], then take the **Heavenly Talisman’s position of the Application Year** [天式上行年神位], place a **single layer of the Long-Life Talisman** [長生符] upon it, and **subdue and suppress** [鎮克] the calamity. Thus, **one shall forever not fear being harmed by others** [永不畏加臨人害].\n\nThe **Long-Life Talisman** [長生符] is **woven with inner talismans** [卷內符] and **inscribed in vermilion** [朱書], with **this single layer** [此符一道] placed **upon the Heavenly Talisman’s original life-force and Application Year position** [安天式上本命行年神位]. It **subdues and repels calamities** [鎮卻災厄]. If **worn on the left arm behind the elbow** [一道帶之於左肘之後], it **shall not protect other talismans** [用加諸式不畏], but rather **harm one’s own body** [反損己身].\n\nThe **Five Agents** [五行] begin with **Worldly Water** [世水], which is the **Chen Star’s scattered *qi*** [辰星散炁]. Water can **transform into refined *qi*** [精炁] and **become a Dragon** [從龍], and the Dragon **borrows the Chen Star’s yin *qi*** [假辰星陰炁] to **generate feathers** [而生羽]. Feathers are the **Chen Star’s yang *qi* dispersing** [羽是辰星之陽炁散], **congealing into yin** [凝陰], and **returning to water** [而為水]. **The yang *qi* of water** [水陽炁] is what **produces feathers** [所生羽], and **feathers represent humanity** [羽是人].\n\nThe surname **Feather** [羽姓] is taken from this, and **one who bears this surname** [既有其人] should **marry with descendants of the Shang surname** [而取商姓之子], producing **five sons** [生五子]. The **eldest son** [長子] shall take the **original surname of Water** [初姓水], the **second son** [二子] shall bear the surname **Feather** [羽姓], the **third and fourth sons** [三子、四子] shall **collectively be surnamed Feather** [總成羽姓], and the **fifth son** [五子] shall bear the surname **Red** [赤], which is the **modern Red Clan** [今之赤氏]. Many have **altered their surnames** [亦多改姓], such as the **Jufu Wu Clan** [朱浮吳氏].\n\nAdditionally, the **third and second sons’ branches** [三子、二子支中] often **change or alter surnames** [後代多改易姓], such as the **Pan, Luo, Gan, Wang, and Shi surnames** [潘、羅、甘、王、石之姓].\n\nNow, **those who gather these talismans** [今據合是羽姓之人] should **refine Mercury** [合煉水銀]. Mercury **belongs to Water** [水銀屬水], while **Metal belongs to Shang** [金屬商], and **Metal and Water are harmoniously combined** [金水合宜].

      "translated_text": "The Lord said: *\"I have not heard that there is the Step of the Great Yu, the one who tamed the floods. When he regulated the waters, the Most High descended and personally observed him as he took three steps with nine strides.*\n\nThe Most High, Laozi, instructed Yu: *'Do you not see the spirit of the Douyi bird, which takes flight? Even birds follow the principle of three steps and nine strides, turning stones and wood to seize serpents. A note: If birds, which have such intent, can do this, how much more so can humans?'*\n\nYu received the teaching and sought the method, and thus mastered the **Five Dipper Transformation** [翻五斗], ascending to the **Supreme Polarity** [太极], assuming a **water-essence corpse** [水精为尸], and being buried in the **Southern Yue** [南越].\n\nUpon this, the Master awoke and learned it. After five years, his body truly grew feathers and hair. In one year, he could fly ten *li*, five *li*—people at the time called this feathered man who could fly the **Guest of the Plumed Body** [毛羽之客]. Thus, he earned his name.\n\nLater, after seven years, he could fly a thousand *li*, entering the **Celestial Abyss** [洞天], coming and going between the mortal realm for hundreds of years. Suddenly, one day, he rode a dragon and departed, never returning.\n\nHis five descendants each changed their surnames, though even after changing them, they could not depart from the North. Thus, they became the **Five Qi** [五炁].\n*A note: All regions follow the Five Surnames, corresponding to metal, water, wood, fire, and earth as qi. Each color governs a direction; hence, people today are called \"born on a certain *yin* day, the son of green,\" and so on.*\n\nThe virtue of accumulated water and the spread of Yu’s achievements—this is the transformation of the **Minister of the Hour Star** [辰星]. Though slightly fearful of earth, earth, though subduing water, cannot utterly extinguish it when water is abundant.\n\nThe use of the Five Surnames lies in water’s ability to both nourish and harm things. It leans toward supporting wood while embracing metal’s mutual generation and assistance.\n\nPractitioners of the Dao, when walking upon the **Water Star** [水星], must also manipulate the **Wood Key** [木诀] and the **Metal Key** [金诀], aligning with water. Water will then nourish the **True Qi** [真炁] and sustain it within the body.\n\nLater, the **Saintly Sovereign** [后圣君] told the **Great King** [大王君]:\n*\"Your disciple, Master Mao Ying and Master Mao Gu, are water-destined individuals. When practicing the Step, first manipulate the **Wood Star Key** [木星诀]. Then, with the fingers of your next hand, point to the Wood Star, supporting the body and solidifying the spirit. Only then can one attain the **Lower True** [下真] and become the **Earthly Master of the Celestial Rank** [地上主仙位]. For though aged and spiritually exhausted, they can no longer ascend and fly. Only after a hundred or a thousand years, if they do not encounter a great Daoist, can they await the **Upper True** [上真].\"*\n\nThe Most High, Laozi, told **Yuanji Zi** [元极子]:\n*A note: This is Mr. Wuji, a Qin native, surnamed Zheng, named Jichu.*\n*\"You too follow the principle of the Five Surnames, leaning toward the Water Surname. You have merit, and you revere water well—thus, the water dragon appeared and bestowed a book upon you. Those who revere the Water Surname and honor water deeply are often those of the Water Surname, who habitually walk the Dipper and manipulate the Water Star Key, their hearts ever respectful.*\n\nIf one practices the Dao, and again manipulates the **Earth Key** [土诀] for five years, the gods of the rivers and seas will appear before them, teaching you the method of **taming dragons**, making rain and clear skies respond to your will as if by hand, accomplished in an instant. Is this not the result of preserving the merit of water in practice, thus enabling you to **race dragons and command rain**, swift as thought?\n\nWuji followed this teaching, and indeed, as foretold, he later rode a dragon and ascended to the **Mysterious Isle** [玄洲].\"*\n\nIn the time of **Emperor Yao and Shun**, there was **Mountain-Dwelling Child Xu Xun**, a water-destined individual. He often revered water, creating a pond, and always instructed his household to treat it with utmost respect. He also habitually drank a *he* of water daily.\n\nAfter six years, suddenly, a mirror appeared at the pond’s center, six *cun* wide, round and beautiful like the moon. Xu Xun carried it, and sixteen mirror spirits followed him. There were also fourteen jade maidens, fourteen jade boys, and one general.\n\nXu Xun asked, and they replied: *\"We are great gods. The Great Minister of the Hour Star returned the **Northern Sky Water Mother’s Mirror** [北霄水母之镜] to us, fearing you might lose it and suffer harm. We tested you. If you truly revered water, believed in the Five Phases, habitually walked the stars and Dipper, and used the method without deceit, then if you passed the test, we would grant you the **Celestial True Rank** [天真之位]. Later, though you failed, you ascended to the **Supreme Polarity** [太极] and did not attain the **Upper Pure** [上清].\"*\n\nThe **Saintly Sovereign** then instructed **Mao Xi** [茅喜]:\n*A note: Xi was the great-grandfather of Ying, serving as the teacher of Le Ba.*\n*\"At the end of the Qin Dynasty, he attained immortality and could transform water into rain. The method of transforming water into rain:*\n\nOn **homologous *bingzi* days** [丙子日] and **homologous *jiazi* days** [甲子日], take a basin of water, holding it in your left hand, and walk the **Earthly Circuit** [地纪] three times.\n*A note: If skilled, simply walk while mentally visualizing the shape of the Northern Dipper’s Earthly Circuit—do not form the Central Dipper shape. The Central Dipper belongs to earth, causing rain to fail. Always form the Northern Dipper shape. If your visualization and intent are profound and effective, even without walking the circuit, it will work. Merely walk while focusing your mind—it will surely take effect.*\n\nAfter three circuits, perform the **Yu Step** [禹步] three times, then spread to the **Three Wilds** [三野] six times, and to the **Six Wilds** [六野] nine times. The **Nine Wilds** [九野] will fill the sky with rain. Obtain the nine circuits.\n\nAfter completing the steps, manipulate the **Rain-Invoking Key** [行雨诀], holding nine mouthfuls of water, and spit them toward the sky. In an instant, the heavens and earth darken, and rain falls.\n\nThis method is divine and verifiable—do not use it recklessly. If there is no drought, do not employ it. For drought is a prohibition by the **Celestial Emperor** [天帝], and using it invites the crime of **rebelling against Heaven** [反天之罪]. The **Saintly Sovereign’s decree** will surely demote you in the **Daoist ranks** [仙品]. This method was granted only to those of sincere intent.\n\nIf there is a fire disaster, you may use it to save people’s homes and those in peril from fire. Spread open, perform the **Yu Step** three times, expand to the **Three Wilds** six times, and to the **Six Wilds** nine times. Walking the circuit will cause rain to fall across the **Nine Heavens**, even a thousand *li* away.\n\nThe **Four Directions’ Dragon Gods** will race through the clouds, bringing rain to save a certain household or family from fire disaster.\"\n*A note: This refers to Emperor Wu’s subject Le Ba, who, after serving wine to the emperor, bowed and, facing southwest, spat and summoned rain to save his own home and relatives from fire.*",

The Three Realms are Metal, Wood, and Earth.\n\nMetal: The vulgar scholars, following the Buddha’s teachings, liken Metal to precious gems, jade, and treasures that do not attract women or music—unaffected by them.\n\nEarth: The vulgar scholars liken Earth to official rank, honor, wealth, and the arrogance of territorial rule—unaffected by them.\n\nWood: The vulgar scholars interpret Wood as not sitting in pavilions, halls, or lofty structures, with no attachments of the heart—this is called the mind transcending the Three Realms. This, according to Daoist classification, is called the mind transcending, yet the body has not yet transcended.\n\nWhen the body fails, the next life’s body will again suffer the afflictions of honor and nobility—still within the Three Realms, governed by the Five Phases—this is called the body not transcending the Five Phases.\n\nI have grasped the essence of the **Middle True**, dispelling Water and Fire calamities, transcending the Five Phases, surpassing the Three Realms, and dwelling with body and mind intact, traversing Heaven, Earth, Water, and Fire without harm.\n\nWearing the talisman for one year dispels the Five Sorrows and Nine Calamities.\nFor two years, one can repel all poisons and subdue the Five Armies.\nFor three years, one avoids death and rebirth.\nFor four years, one receives a worldly appointment—named **Book of the Jade Capital**.\nFor five years, one escapes Water and Fire.\n**Note:** To depart from their afflictions is to no longer consume the *qi* of Water and Fire; their *qi* cannot harm those who wear the talisman.\n\n**Laozi, the Most High Venerable, told Mr. Yin:**\n*\"Wearing the Water and Fire talismans for five years renders Water and Fire powerless to harm.\nWearing the Metal, Wood, and Earth talismans renders Metal unable to conquer, Wood unable to harm, and Earth unable to injure. The Five Phases depart from the body, making it firm and enduring—long-lived, yet not attaining the rank of the lower-grade Immortals.\"*\n\nIn six and seven years, one gradually attains wondrous powers.\nAt forty-nine years, one ascends in broad daylight.\n**Note:** The Five Phases’ ultimate subtlety lies in Water and Fire, which govern life, growth, sickness, and decay.\n\n**Laozi told the Great True Ones:**\n*\"The characters Water and Fire are not merely feared by beings of the lower realms for their power over success and failure.\n**Note:** Because humans have fate and rely on water for sustenance, escaping creation and avoiding decay is difficult—that is why they are feared.\n\nEven the highest True Immortals, in their constant practice, still employ talismanic steps to avoid their original fate.\n**Note:** *Fate* refers to one’s destiny.\nThe Dao Lord was born in the *yin* hour of the Fire Phase, always using the *bing* hour of the Water Phase to manipulate Water talismans, then the Fire talismans, to seek longevity. How much more so for worldly folk, who do not seek immortality, yet must observe their natal day’s talismans.\n\nThe natal day’s Earth Phase rises first; the worldly Earth corresponds to the *Zhen* star, dispersing *qi* from the Earthly Palace.\n**Note:** *Palace* refers to **Di Huang** (地皇).\nSurname: Palace; given name: Wind.\nDi Huang ruled with Earth’s virtue, piling earth to form platforms, erecting stone pillars, and digging earthen chambers.\n**Note:** High earthen mounds were built, over a hundred *zhang* tall, with four-directional cavities as palatial dwellings. These cavities were called the Palace surname.\n\nWhy is the character *Palace* (宮) written with a doubled mouth radical?\nBecause palaces were built of earth, with layered towers, and chambers dug to shelter people—*Palace* (宮) carries the meaning of layered accumulation, hence the doubled mouth radical. Over time, the upper layers collapsed, damaging the lower ones.\n\nThe **Human Sovereign** observed this, knowing that the upper collapse and lower damage of the Palace chambers were written as *harm* (害), resembling *Palace* (宮), thus depicting the destructive force of collapse. The lower mouth radical signifies the upper overcoming the lower.\n\nThus, the character *harm* (害) spread in the world, corresponding to the Earth star, bringing destructive *qi* that injures and kills people.\n\nA large chamber is called a *Palace*, and Palace became a surname.\nToday, those with the Palace surname are honored, reflecting Di Huang’s intention to elevate humanity—thus, the Earth surname is revered as the first of the Five Phases.\n\nThey intermarried with the Zheng surname, producing six sons.\nThe eldest changed his surname to Wind, the second to Gong, the third to Worker, the fourth, fifth, and sixth retained the Palace surname.\n\nWhen the Zheng wife died, he again intermarried with a Shang surname descendant, producing another six sons.\nThe eldest changed his surname to Gongsun, the second to Li, the third to Fei,\n**Note:** Today’s surnames Zhan and Ren are derived from this.\nthe fourth, fifth, and sixth retained the Palace surname.\n\nMoreover, Di Huang had twelve sons, taking the abundant *qi* of Earth.\nHe intermarried with the five surnames, and their descendants became kings, mirroring the Earth star’s retrograde cycle through the four seasons.\nThus, Earth’s sovereign rule over the four seasons was established.\nThe Earth’s harmful *qi* constantly circulates through the seasons, and those whose fate aligns with it suffer illness within ten days.\nThose who know this manipulate Wood talismans, step the Wood Array,\n**Note:** The Eastern Host of Seven Stars is the Wood Array.\nto disperse it and halt the affliction.\nThus, Earth fears Wood, for Wood can conquer Earth.\nEarth constantly supports Wood, yet Wood fears it in return.\n\nPractitioners with an Earth destiny should manipulate Metal talismans to stop Wood calamities.\nThose with a Wood destiny should manipulate Fire talismans to stop Metal.\nThose with a Metal destiny should manipulate Water talismans to stop Fire.\nThose with a Fire destiny should manipulate Earth talismans to stop Water.\nThose with a Water destiny should manipulate Wood talismans to stop Earth.\n\nThus, within the Five Phases, the Earth Phase harbors the most destructive *qi*.\nAll Five Phases’ mutual generation and conquest are subsumed within Earth’s influence.\nMoreover, the Earth star completes a cycle every thirty-five years, governing the Nine Regions and the Five Phases.\n\nAmong the Five Tones, *Gong* (宮) is primary.\nIf following the *Fei* Step Talisman’s teachings, then Metal is primary.\nThe two accounts differ.\n**Note:** According to the *San Cai Lun* (三才论), Heaven, Earth, and Human are called the Three Powers.",

      "translated_text": "From the moment Heaven arises, Earth immediately follows.\nEarth is established, and then **Earth Phase** is born from Earth.\nThe Earth that comes before is **Metal**, and Earth produces Metal—so Metal is primary.\n\nAccording to *Master Yin’s Record* (《尹先生记》), the *Divine Record of All Spirits* (《神灵具录》) states:\nThe **Venerable Laozi’s** mother was of **Metal destiny**, and from her arose the **Venerable Laozi**.\nThe **Venerable Laozi** then ascended and took the position of **Posterior Sage Celestial Sovereign** (后圣天尊).\nThus, when he proclaimed the talisman to the **Three Officials of the Northern Dipper** (命三官北斗咒),\nhe said: *\"Metal, Water, Fire, Wood, Earth—\nthe Way’s principles never stray from their natural connections.*\nAll Five Phases are means of generation,\nyet they dwell upon Earth.\nThe **Posterior Sage Sovereign** takes Metal as primary.\"\n\nFor Earth is the **longest of the Three Realms** (三界).\nThe **Venerable Laozi** declared to all **Imperial Sovereigns** (帝君):\n*\"I often ponder the **Lower Truth** and **Upper Immortals** (下真上仙),\nthose who seek the Dao without departing the Three Realms.\nHow can they attain imperishability and non-extinction?\nYou have mastered the Three Realms—\nwhy not awaken and guide those who remain unenlightened,\nso they may forever transcend and escape the Three Realms,\nunobstructed by **demonic thieves** (魔贼).\nBeyond the Three Realms lies the **Three Pure Ones** (三清),\nwhere the **Supreme Truth** (至真) resides.\nIs this not the **palace of compassionate efficacy** (慈力济度之功),\nthe **peerless virtue** (无上之德) of the body?\"*\n\nFire is the **male of the Three Realms** (三界之男人).\nWithout Fire, one’s destiny is incomplete.\nThus, one must borrow **qi** to refine it,\nnurturing the **vital roots** (身根) for longevity’s pulse.\n\nWater is the **consort of the Three Realms** (三界之妻).\nWithout Water, humans perish;\nwith Water, humans live.\nLife and death both depend on Water,\nwhich nourishes all things—\nhow much more so the human body alone?\n\nThe **Posterior Sage Sovereign**’s talisman commands the **Three Realms’ Destructive King** (命三界魔王):\n*\"Your domain encompasses the Three Realms—\nall beings and figures return to you.\nWithout the Three Realms, nothing is born;\nwithout the Three Realms, nothing is nurtured;\nwithout the Three Realms, nothing grows.\nFrom birth to death, they cycle endlessly,\nyet none know how to return.\nWater and Fire never cease—\nlife and death return to Earth.\nNo high nor low, no old nor young—\nall come and go, lost in delusion.\nThey do not know where their minds originate,\nyet they seek escape from the Three Realms.\nThe **demonic kings** all kneel and bow twice,\nbegging to transcend the Three Realms,\nbut their minds cling—\nthey do not know to abandon Water and Fire,\nand thus their bodies starve and die.\nWithout Water and Fire, food cannot be refined;\nwithout Earth, Water and Fire cannot dwell and interact.\nThus, I know that such beings\ncannot step away from suffering—\nhow can they escape the Three Realms?\"*\n\nThe **Posterior Sage Sovereign** replied:\n*\"There are six methods to escape the Three Realms.\nIf one follows them, the body and mind naturally transcend the Three Realms.\nWhy restrict oneself from Water and Fire?\"*\n\nFor Water and Fire are the **true qi of Yin and Yang** (阴阳之真炁),\nand Earth is the **master of the Five Phases** (五行之主).\nWhy would one remove them?\n\nMoreover, the **Supreme Celestial Immortals** (上圣天仙)\neach employ distinct methods.\nI shall now reveal them to you—\nlisten and receive them.\n\n**First Method:** The body and mind receive instruction,\nabandoning Water and excluding Fire.\n**Note:** Water and Fire are two **natures** (二性).\nThe **nature of Water and Fire** benefits humans—\nthis is called **virtue/power** (德).\nIf Water and Fire inflict harm upon humans,\nthis is called **theft** (贼).\nThus, this is the **second method**.\n\nHeaven cannot bring calamity,\nEarth cannot cause disaster.\n**Note:** When the mind excludes the **nature of Water and Fire**,\nHeaven cannot harm, Earth cannot ruin—\nthe body is at peace.\n\n**Second Method:** The body and mind are **Earth-locked**, **sealing the essence** (土镇锁津).\n**Note:** This metaphorically refers to **ascending immortals** (身上仙者) preserving their **vital essence** (精).\nThose who practice **chambered cultivation** (行房帷之事),\nmust **seal their essence** (闭精不泄).\nIf it leaks, the **spirit is diminished** (损神),\nand **vital essence exhaustion ruins the body** (少津败身).\nIf one can **store and return it to the spirit** (存归神),\nand **excess essence moistens the body** (溢津润身),\nthen **longevity’s pulse flows abundantly** (通多).\nMoreover, **practice must not be stagnant** (行不陈),\nand there are **precepts within the Dao** (自有经旨),\nthus attaining **Celestial Truth** (天真).\n\n**Third Method:** **Conquer Metal and regulate Fire** (制金理火).\n**Note:** The **root destiny day** (本命日) begins with one **step of the Yu’s tread** (地纪一遍),\nthen transforms into **Yu’s tread** (禹步),\nand the **Metal talisman** (捻金诀) is performed.\nOn the **left hand’s fingernail**, the **Fire talisman** (甲为火) is manipulated,\nand the **five fingers point to the Metal star** (指金星) three times.\nUpon completion, one recites the **Metal-Wood talisman** (金木咒),\ninvoking the **conquest of Metal and Wood** (金木相克), saying thus:\n*\"The seven stars shine resplendent,\nthe **Metal talisman** is most formidable.\"*\n\n**Fourth Method:** **Conquer Wood and regulate Metal** (制木理金).\n**Note:** The **root destiny day** (本命日) begins with one **step of the Heavenly Tread** (天纲一遍),\nthen transforms into **Yu’s tread** (禹步),\nand the **Wood talisman** (捻木诀) is performed.\nOn the **left hand**, one forms the **Metal Axe** (金斧),\nand points to the **Wood star** (指木星) three times.\nUpon completion, one **treads three times** (蹑三度),\nand recites the **Five Phases invocation** (五行祝),\nsaying: *\"The **Heavenly Tread talisman** (天纲中咒),\nMetal, Water, Wood, Fire, Earth—\nMetal and Wood mutually push aside,\nthe seven stars shine resplendent,\nthe **Heavenly Tread talisman** is most formidable.\"*\n\nThe **four methods above** are means to **dispel the Three Realms’ calamities** (消三界之灾害)\nand **harmonize the Five Phases’ mutual conquest** (五行之相人於难克).\nIf one follows these methods,\nwithin a year, the **five torments** (五苦), **eight hardships** (八难),\n**nine adversities** (九厄), and **hundred diseases** (百病) in the body\nshall naturally be eliminated.\nThis is called **alignment** (顺).\nThe original **teacher treads the Earthly Tread** (履地纪),\n**steps on the Dipper** (蹑斗),\nand upon **receiving transmission and guidance** (传度时受讫),\nnow practices the **root destiny day** (本命日) for **cultivation of the truth** (修真),\nthe methods to escape the Three Realms and Five Phases.\n\n**Note:** According to *The Secret Precepts of Inner Perfection from the Great Peace Scripture* (《太平经□内品修真秘诀》),\nthe **Uppermost Pure Immortal** (上清大真人) before ascending to Heaven\neach took their **root destiny day** (本命),\nand practiced the **four talismanic methods** (四等法诀).\nLater, they **trod the Dipper star** (步履斗星),\n**grasped the Earthly Tread** (镊地纪),\nand ascended through the **Heavenly Gate** (升登天门).\nThey then entered the **Golden Threshold and Jade Terrace** (金阙玉台),\nbecoming the **Posterior Sage Sovereign** (后圣君).\n\n**Fifth Method:** **Comprehensively conquer the Five Phases** (总制五行),\n**transcending them from the body’s exterior** (於身之外).\n**Note:** The **Posterior Sage Sovereign** said:\n*\"The **talisman given to the Heavenly Master** (授天师诀),\nthe method to **comprehensively conquer the Five Phases from the body’s exterior** (制五行於身之外法).\"*\n\nThe **Six Celestial Stems** (六甲) encompass **six periods** (六旬),\nand within each **six periods** (旬),\nthere is a **root destiny day** (本命日).\nFirst, one **treads the Earthly Tread** (蹑地纪),\nthen **treads the Three Platforms** (蹑三台),\nwhich is **treading the Five Stars** (履五星),\neach requiring **five repetitions** (各须五遍).\nOne recites the **Five Phases talismans** (五行咒) **eighteen times** (十八篇),\nand *The Rolling Pearl* (《流珠》) **upper scroll** (上卷) contains the precepts.\n\nThen, one **treads the Fire Tread** (步火纲) three

years** grants ascension to the Dao.\n\nThe **Lower Grade Six Jia** expel misfortune from the body,\nAnd are used in calculations for **decrepit kings** (算衰王).\n\nThe **Later Sage Lord Lao** instructed the **Jade Boys and Ladies of the Rectangular Array** (方诸童君夫人):\n*\"For those who wish to cultivate the body and prolong life,\nFirst, they must cultivate and ingest the divine talismans of the Six Jia.\nThis was the most sacred method of the **Earlier Sage**,\nCommonly known as the **Lord Lao’s Secret Six Jia Talismans**.\nThe method of ingestion is as follows:\nEach time one recites the names of the **Divine Officials** (神直官),\nOne summons the **Talisman Clerks of the Decade** (旬将),\nAnd the names of the **Jade Girls**.\n\nUpon summoning, one must recite the **Earlier Sage’s

Officials**, **Talisman Clerks**, and **Jade Girls**.\nOne must call upon each by name.\n\nThe Master says:\n*\"The secret lies in this:\nThe Six Jia deities have many repeated names and surnames,\nAnd one cannot remember them all.\nThus, small wooden or bamboo plaques are made,\nUpon which the names of the deities, generals, clerks, and jade girls are inscribed,\nAnd each is recorded accordingly.\nWhether standing, walking, sitting, or reclining,\nOne must always bear their names in mind.\nIn urgent matters, one must blow upon and invoke the talismans,\nTo rescue people, subdue ghosts, expel evil, and repel harm.\nIf one’s life is in peril, the plaques should be taken out,\nAnd the names invoked immediately—\nThe response will be instantaneous.\n\nHowever, when sleeping at night or entering a woman’s chamber,\nOne must hang them in a secure place on the wall or pillar,\nAnd they will still be effective.\nDo not hang them on the doorframe,\nFor the **Doorframe Deities** (门户神) may fear them,\nCausing unrest.\n\nOne must commit their names to memory.\nWhen urgently invoking them,\nIt must be done as swiftly as **hand responds to heart** (手应心),\nAnd as decisively as **heart commands the mouth** (心制口).\n*Annotation:* In the **Upper Ancient** (上古) era, great Daoists practiced **direct heart-mouth control** (直心制口),\nWhere their words were never misspoken.\nThus, a heart’s vow is the same as a mouth’s vow—\nIt must be genuine.\nThis is the practice of the **Dao Immortals** (仙人).\n\nThe talismans will arrive immediately upon invocation.\nOne must remember their names and surnames,\nAnd keep them in mind during leisure hours.\nWhen urgently invoked,\nTheir power will manifest instantly.\nMoreover, before eating or drinking,\nOne must first mentally invoke them,\nAnd maintain the presence of the **Divine Officials**, **Talisman Clerks of the Decade**, and **Jade Girls** throughout the day.\nIf one shares food and drink with them as subjects,\nThey will bestow the **Mysterious Sweet Offerings** (玄甘飨).\nWhen consuming various foods, drinks, or fruits,\nOne must always mentally invoke them daily,\nAnd share in the same food and drink.\nThis practice, when consistently applied,\nWill yield great efficacy.\n\nThey can also suppress **army disasters** (兵害) and subdue **heavenly demons** (天魔).\n*Annotation:* In antiquity, a Daoist in the mountains named **Li Boyao** (李伯药),\nOften cultivated the **Six Jia Method** and ingested the talismans.\nHe stayed in the mountains for five years without emerging.\n\nOne day, suddenly, he saw a man in green robes,\nRiding a leopard, offering a small bottle.\nThe man said:\n*\"This is the **Great Elixir Master Boyao** (大丹伯药).\nYou have nearly attained the Dao,\nBut your form and spirit are withering.\nYou must ingest this elixir,\nAnd you will achieve long life.\nI have come today to bestow this medicine upon you—\nThis is the **True Great Reversion Elixir** (真大还丹).\nHere is a golden bottle.\nLook, the bottle contains the **True Golden Elixir** (真金丹),\nWith pills of a **purple-gold hue** (紫金色).\nI tell you, my disciples:\nI have now attained the Dao.\nThe **Daoist Messengers** (仙使) have brought me the **Great Elixir** (太丹).\nI will take it and ascend to the heavens.\nYou must follow my practice,\nAnd never waver in your resolve—\nYou will surely also obtain this elixir.\nOn the day of my departure,\nCome to the heavens to seek me out.\"\n\nLi Boyao’s disciple, **Wei Xiang** (韦祥), did not yet understand,\nAnd only heard voices in the forest,\nAs if from hundreds of people,\nIncluding the sounds of women.\n\nIn a short while, one voice issued orders:\n*\"Seize him!\"*\nImmediately, over ten men in red robes,\nClad as **leopard-riding messengers** (乘豹使者),\nCaptured and threw the man to the ground.\nHe transformed into an **Old Dragon** (老龙),\nAnd the leopard into an **Old Tiger** (老虎).\nThey struck him with twenty blows.\n\nWith a stern command, they declared:\n*\"Li Boyao has attained the Dao,\nThough he has not yet gained renown—\nHe has long been inscribed in the **Daoist Register** (仙籍).\nHow dare he act as a **malevolent ghost** (为祟),\nSeeking to harm with poisonous elixir!\"*\n\nLi Boyao knew this was not a true person,\nAnd questioned them about their origins.\nThe **Jade Girl of Jia-Shen** (甲申玉女) responded:\n*\"The **Heavenly Demon Poison Ghosts** (天魔毒鬼),\nTransformed into an Old Dragon and Old Tiger,\nTo harm you.\nIf you do not diligently cultivate the Six Jia,\nYou will surely fall to their poison and die.\"*\n\nIn a short while, the **Dragon and Tiger Poison Ghosts** (龙虎毒) all dissolved into ghosts and perished.\nWere it not for the **Six Jia Deities’ power** (六甲神之功),\nLi Boyao would not have been saved,\nAnd would have been poisoned by the **Heavenly Demon’s elixir** (天魔进药) and died.\n\nNow, this account is recorded for the world.\nPeople should not presume to refuse or neglect them—\nThe **Heavenly Demon** will take back the elixir,\nAnd depart in submission after bowing.\nThey will no longer dare to harm others,\nAnd such instances often occur.\nThis allows one to earn merit and attain the Dao.»",

you will naturally attain communion with the gods.\nThis method is subtle and profound,\nAnd should not be carelessly transmitted to those unworthy.\n\n**Laozi** (老君) said:\n*\"This method possesses six divine powers (六通神力).\nFirst, it grants passage into the **Great Dao’s Gate** (大道之门),\nSkillfully leveraging the **Dao’s authority** (假道威),\nSubduing gods and enslaving ghosts,\nQuelling and annihilating malevolent spirits and **Jiao-demons** (精妖),\nSevering and dispelling **Feng-spirits** (凶祟).\n\nSecond, it allows communion with the **Heavenly Realm** (通天),\nInspiring the **Heavenly Gods** (天神) and **Heavenly Dragons** (天龙)\nTo exterminate demons and subdue **Heavenly Conflicts** (祆).\nIt can gather clouds and summon rains,\nCountering the **obstructive and malevolent qi of rebellious spirits** (逆横祆恶之炁),\nAnd effectively dispel such calamities.\n\nThird, it grants communion with the **Earthly Realm** (通地),\nInspiring the **Earthly Gods** (地神) and **Earthly Dragons** (地龙),\nAs well as the **Wind and Cloud Lords** (风云雷公),\n**Lightning, Rain, and Wind Officials** (电师雨师风师),\nThe **Five Sacred Mountains** (五岳) and **Four Celestial Constraints** (四镇).\n*Note: The Four Celestial Constraints are also called the Four Rivers (四渎), the official waters that constrain the mountains.*\nThe **Nine Regions and Ten Thousand States, Myriad Countries** (九州千邦万国),\nAnd all **terrestrial deities** (土地山川神灵),\n**Ancestral shrines and city gods** (社庙城隍),\n*Note: City God (城隍神) is a deity appointed by the later Sage Emperor (后圣君) to oversee the Underworld (地府).*\nAs recorded in the **Sū Brū** (苏吴纪纪云): *\"King Fú of Wú\"* (吴王苪是).\nThe **Left Ancestral and Right Harvest Deities** (左社右稷神官).\nThey will assist the realm,\nProtect your person and family,\nAnd aid all living beings.\n\nFourth, it grants communion with the **Watery Realm** (通水),\nInspiring the **Water Gods** (水神) and **Water Dragons** (水龙),\nAs well as the **Water Officials** (水中君官),\n**Generals and Spirit Ministers** (将军灵吏),\nAnd all **fish, scales, and beasts** (鱼鳞兽等).\nThey will assist the **Dao** and protect your person,\nHelp your family and realm,\nAnd aid all living beings.\n\nFifth, it grants communion to **guard and shield** (通感卫) the person.\nIf one persistently cultivates and practices it,\nOne’s body and family will transcend the **Five Phases** (五行),\nAnd achieve eternal harmony.\nIt removes the **Five Sufferings** (五苦),\n**Eight Hardships** (八难),\nAnd **Nine Calamities** (九厄),\nAnd all diseases will naturally vanish.\nOne will rise above the **Three Realms** (三界),\nAttain **Long Life** (长生),\nAnd command the **Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water** (天地水三官神灵),\nWith distinct and clear results.\n\nSixth, it grants communion to **command the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper** (七星北斗君),\n**Divine Consorts and Ladies** (神妃后女),\n*Note: Within the Northern Dipper (北斗), there is one Principal Lady (正后),\nThree Consorts (三妃),\nTwo Ladies-in-Waiting (二夫人),\nAnd two Delicate Damsels (并二娇女),\nAll holding titles as the Seven Officials of the Northern Dipper (北斗之七君位号).*\nAnd others, to oversee the **register of human deaths** (主世人之死簿).\nWhen people learn of this,\nThey often take **Six Jia Days** (六甲日) to create diagrams,\nFirst following the **Earthly Measure** (地纪),\nThen the **Heavenly Measure** (天纲),\nAnd finally the **Yǔ Steps** (禹步).\n*Note: The Three Measures (三等) correspond to the Three Elements (三元数).*\nCommon folk follow the **Heavenly Measure** (步纲),\nUsing the **Earthly Measure** (地纪) as the **Upper Element** (上元).\nImmortals follow the **Heavenly Measure** (步纲),\nUsing the **Heavenly Measure** (天纲) as the **Upper Element** (上元).\nAs **Yǐn Shòu** (尹寿子) said:\n*\"For common folk, whose bodies have not yet transcended the Three Realms (三界),\nThey follow the Earthly Measure (地纪) first,\nThus making it the Upper Element (上元).\nFor Immortals, whose bodies have transcended the Three Realms of Water, Fire, and Earth (水火三界),\nThey follow the Heavenly Measure (天纲) first,\nThus making it the Upper Element (上元).\nMoreover, the practice of the Heavenly Measure (步纲法),\nMust be completed in three full sets of steps,\nCalled the Heavenly Measure Steps (步纲数).\nThis is referred to as the **Heavenly, Earthly, and Human** (天地人),\nWhich corresponds to the method of transcending the Three Realms and Three Calamities (三界三灾),\nAnd entering the path of **Divine Immortality** (神仙),\nThe **Dao of Long Life and Non-Death** (长生不死之道).\nThere is a secret formula within the *Líu Zhū Shàng Yǐn* (流珠上引).\n*Note: The formula is found in the first volume of the *Líu Zhū Shàng Yǐn* (流珠上引).*\nAll who learn the **Dao** (学道者),\nShould understand this principle,\nAnd thus know the **Six Jia’s Six Powers** (六甲六通),\nTo transcend the Three Realms of Water and Fire (离水火三界之法),\nAnd avoid the calamities of the **Seven Mansions** (去七宿之灾害).\n*Note: The Southern Dipper (南斗) oversees the vital qi (王炁) of all people,\nCausing them to attain early birth, longevity, and prosperity (早得生荣长年),\nAnd wishes that people do not die.\nThe Northern Dipper (北斗) oversees the declining qi (衰炁) of all people,\nCausing them to fall ill early and die from severe disease (早得疾病，病极而死).\nThe later Sage Emperor (后圣君) greatly abhorred this,\nThus he reversed the roles of the Northern and Southern Dippers (前后易身出世),\nAnd revealed the **Divine Talismans and Secret Dao** (告命灵符秘法),\nInterpreting the *Jīn Suǒ Líu Zhū* (金锁流珠) as a new name,\nChanging the old terminology of *Jīn Luó* (金箓),\nClarifying the method of following the Heavenly and Earthly Measures (明出天纲地纪步蹑之道),\nTo subdue and control the **six yin deities of the Northern Dipper** (制伏北斗中六阴之神灾害炁),\nEternally attaining the **Dao of Long Life and Divine Immortality** (永出长生仙道),\nAnd avoiding the influence of the Northern Dipper (得离北斗之下).\nWhen common folk encounter this,\nThey all know to practice and cultivate it.\nIf they do so with sincerity and achieve results,\nThe six yin deities of the Northern Dipper—\nThe **Consorts, Ladies, and Delicate Damsels** (神君妃后娇女等)—\nWill fear and submit to their commands,\nUsing them as **divine garments** (为衣),\nAnd following their hand gestures to open the **Heavenly Gate** (转天关),\nSubduing all **Heavenly Demons and Earthly Conflicts** (摄天魔地祆).\nThis is what the later Sage Emperor (后圣君) taught in his great transmission.\nIt allows one to attain the Dao (得道),\nAnd ascend to the heavens (上升云天).\n\n**Laozi, the Most High Sage** (太上老君),\nExplained the **Secret Talismans of the Six Jia** (六甲秘符文) as follows:\n*\"I practiced the Six Jia Talismans

      "translated_text": "「Three hundred and sixty days,\nThe **Celestial Maiden** (玉女) attends and guards the **soul and vital essence** (魂魄),\nOften appearing in dreams as if in person.\n\nAt one thousand days,\nThe Celestial Maiden will manifest during the day,\nGuarding both the **Divine Essence** (神) and the **Divine Officials** (官).\n*Note: There are often signs of spiritual efficacy and verification (灵瑞征验事), which are not limited to this account.*\n\nAt two thousand days,\nThe talisman’s efficacy manifests—\nThe body enters the realm of the **Immortal Deities** (神仙),\nAnd the Divine Essence appears as a human being,\nOften seen in person.\n\nBut the spoken words (言) are only for the self;\nThe body does not often appear.\nThe **Polarity** (冲) is near to humanity.\n*Note: According to this, Laozi does not often appear in human form,\nBut is seen through the talismans of soldiers, officials, and Celestial Maidens (玉童玉女等).\nFearful that people might doubt his words,\nAnd slander him as a demon (妖), destroying the true Dao,\nHence the transmission through generations.*\n\nThus, the **Direct Transmission of the Single Mind** (正一心直) is passed down,\nEntering the **Way of Non-Action** (无为之道),\nFree from confusion and perversity (无惑无邪),\nFree from error and loss (无非无失),\nAttaining **Oneness** (得一者也).\n\nAt three thousand days,\nThe Six Jia Celestial Maidens (六甲玉女) often appear in person.\n\nAfter fourteen years,\nOne ascends to the heavens (上升天),\nEntering the **Shaking Light** (摇光),\nAnd bowing to the **Big Dipper** (北斗).\n*Note: When a person’s steps align with the Dao (步纲得道),\nThey must first ascend to the Big Dipper’s realm (北斗),\nThen enter the heavenly palaces (天宫).\nHence, the Big Dipper must welcome this person,\nAnd the phrase \"entering the Shaking Light, bowing to the Big Dipper\" (入摇光，低昂北斗) is used.*\n\nThe Big Dipper **lowers once** (北斗一为低),\nAnd the Shaking Light **welcomes below** (摇光之下迎).\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"If one wishes to tread the **Seven Stars** (步七星),\nThe Six Jia must first be perfected.\"*\n\n*Note: For humans, the soul and vital essence (魂魄) all fear the Big Dipper (北斗).\nThus, those who swallow talismans and practice the Six Jia (吞符服六甲)\nCan be reborn in humanity,\nAnd the soul and vital essence no longer fear the Big Dipper.\nHence, the Six Jia can bring rebirth in humanity (生於人),\nAnd the soul no longer fears it,\nYet still fears the Big Dipper.\nTherefore, the Sage Emperors of each generation (代代圣人)\nIntended this as a means to align with the Dao (为纲步之一),\nSo that the soul and vital essence do not fear it.*\n\nTo **subdue the Big Dipper** (伏北斗),\nUse them as **divine garments** (为之衣),\nAnd command them as if they were obedient servants (如从仆),\nRespecting them like kin (敬之如兄妹).\n\nTo tread the **Nine Steps** (步九迹),\nThe Six Jia must first be **accumulated** (先积).\n*Note: \"Accumulated\" (积) refers to the practice of swallowing talismans and cultivating (服符修行积).\nAll are functions of the Six Jia.*\n\nThe Six Jia have three ranks of **Divine Armies** (三等军),\nAnd also three ranks of **Divine Offices** (三等府院).\n*Note: The Divine Offices (府院) resemble the three ranks of armies (三军营),\nAnd there are also three ranks of offices.*\n\nThe highest rank is the **Supreme Unity Office of the Upper Element** (上元太一府),\nThe Six Jia **Divine Army** (六甲军).\n*Note: Within the Supreme Ultimate (太极),\nThis is called the Heavenly Upper (天上),\nThe Six Jia Divine Army’s encampment and office (六甲军营府).*\n\nWith three **Divine Generals** (三官将) overseeing,\nThe generals and their subordinates—Celestial Maidens and Maidens (玉童玉女)—\nAre named as recorded in *Laozi’s Secret Talismans of the Six Jia* (《老君六甲秘符箓》).\n\nThe **soldiers** (兵士) number **three million six hundred thousand** (三百六十万人众),\nTo subdue the **inverted forces of Yin-Yang and the Five Phases** (阴阳五行之逆炁).\nHence, they are stationed in the Supreme Unity Office (上太一之府),\nThe **Upper Divine Official of the True Middle** (上真中官),\nThe **Middle Divine Official of the River Source** (中镇河源),\nAnd the **Lower Divine Official of Humanity** (下镇人世),\nSo that the four seasons follow their commands without error (四时行令不失),\nAnd the Five Phases transform in accordance with their due times (五行变化得时).\n\nThe **Supreme Unity Messenger** (太一使者) commands one army,\nThe **Upper Divine Official of the Heavenly Palace** (上镇天宫),\nTo subdue demons and protect those who attain the Dao (保举得道之人).\n\nThe Supreme Unity Messenger (太一使者)\nEach year presents **three offerings** (三奏) to the **Supreme Daoist Sovereign** (太上道君)\nAnd the **Later Sage Emperor** (后圣君).\n\nThe **Heavenly Master** (天师) says:\n*\"The highest rank of Laozi’s Six Jia (上等老君六甲) is one Sovereign (一君),\nAssisting and guarding at the **Golden Threshold of the Later Sage Emperor** (太平金阙后圣玉皇上道君殿)\nOn the left staircase below (左阶下立).*\n*Note: Like the worldly sovereign (世天子),\nThey stand in the proper court assemblies (会立正朝之卿),\nWith left and right distinctions.*\n\nEach year, they hold **three great assemblies** (三大朝),\nRaising the **flags and banners of the Immortal Deities** (仙真旗仗旌节),\nCommanding the **Divine Forces of Demons** (魔威神) to restrain the hearts of ghosts (制鬼之心),\nSo that they submit to the **Daoic威** (道威),\nAnd the **Ten Heavens** (十天) are properly revered by gods, humans, and deities (天地人神),\nThe **Dragons and Ghosts** (龙鬼) subdue demons (制魔),\nAnd protect those who attain the Dao (保举有道),\nEliminating faults and transgressions (消伏愆过).\n\nWithin one year,\nThere are three assemblies of reverence and offering.\n*Note: The first assembly (上元) is on the fifteenth day of the first month (正月十五日).\nThe second assembly (中元) is on the fifteenth day of the seventh month (七月十五日).\nThe third assembly (下元) is on the fifteenth day of the tenth month (十月十五日).\nIn one year, these three days (三日)\nAre when the gods of the Ten Heavens, the Five Phases, the Six Jia (十天之内，三元五行六甲等),\nAnd the Immortal Deities’ officers and soldiers (神人真仙官兵将玉童玉女等)\nAll, one by one, follow the **Heavenly True Immortal Sovereign** (天真大仙),\nAssisting and guarding in the assemblies before the **Later Sage Emperor’s Heavenly Palace** (玉皇上道君殿前),\nTo inspect the Ten Heavens (明检十天),\nDriving and dividing left and right (驱分左右),\nMarking those with intent (点记有心),\nAnd before them, the true cultivators who have attained the Dao (前言成道之真人),\nTheir number seen in the present and future,\nAnd afterward, they inspect the living populace (后检生民).\n\nWithin the Ten Heavens,\nAll good and evil deeds and merits are reported to the Jade Emperor (玉皇).\nThe Jade Emperor then commands the **Three Officials** (三官),\nEach to subdue the wicked and evil (制伏凶恶),\nTo record the fate of life and death (令部生死),\nTo entrust the inspection of the virtuous and foolish (托受巡内贤愚),\nTo judge and classify crimes and goodness (分判罪善),\nAnd to maintain fairness and equality (允其平等),\nListing their records in the Ten Heavens (列记十天).\n\nDo not allow the **rebellious hearts** (死心) to submit to the world of life and death (屈於生死世界),\nAnd clearly entrust them to the **Divine Official of Fate** (司命).\n\nThe middle rank is the **Six Jia of the Soul’s Flight** (灵飞六甲),\nAssisting and guarding at the **Golden Threshold of the Later Sage Emperor** (太平金阙后圣君玉皇上道君殿)\nOn the right staircase below (右阶下立).\n*Note: The same as the left, in terms of timing and month.*\n\nThe lower rank is the **Yin-Yang Six Jia** (阴阳六甲),\nAssigned to human life according to the **Five Phases’ correspondences** (金木水火土),\nTo match the **life-giving and life-subduing cycles** (得人之命),\nAnd to correspond with the **auspicious and inauspicious timing** (相生相克之候),\nJudging fortune and misfortune (候吉凶) and matching accordingly (而相匹配).\n*Note: This refers to the affairs of Yin-Yang correspondence in humanity (世人夫妻水火相刑相克之事).\nIn practicing the Great Dao (行大道),\nOne naturally dissolves this cycle of subjugation (自消此相克).*\n\nThe latter two ranks of the Six Jia (右些二等六甲),\nFor those who study in the world (世学之人),\nKnowing the methods of these three ranks of the Six Jia (三等六甲之法),\nThe **Six Functions of Practice and Cultivation** (六功修服步蹑)\nMake all matters align with intent (万事应心),\nNaturally dissolving the **Yin’s rapidity in Water and Fire** (自消阴速於水火),\nAnd the **Yin’s attainment of longevity** (阴取长生),\nSwiftly accomplished through the **Nine Steps** (疾於步蹑).\n*Note: Those who speak of the Yin attaining longevity (阴取长生)\nRefer to practicing the Six Jia talismans of Laozi (服老君六甲符),\nAnd the Six Jia talismans of the Soul’s Flight (灵飞六甲符),\nAccumulating their efficacy (功着更着),\nAnd further practicing the Nine Steps to align with the Dao (步蹑天纲地纪之功着),\nSwiftly achieving the **subduing of the Nine Steps** (疾成於步摄).\n\nThus, the highest and middle ranks of practice and cultivation (上中二等修服之功),\nThe first rank’s function of matching fate and destiny (一等以命运匹配),\nMutually supporting, generating, and following (相扶相生相顺),\nEncourages humans to act virtuously (志人善行),\n*Note: The lower rank has its own distinct function,\nAs mentioned earlier in the passage regarding the Five Phases (下等别自有引，在上巷中言五行).*\n\nAnd to establish the **Way of Longevity** (立入长生).\n\nThe second rank is the **Six Jia of the Soul’s Flight, Supreme Unity Office of the Upper Element** (灵飞六甲上元正一府),\nCalled the **Six Jia Divine Army of the

      "translated_text": "With the Master Kong’s teachings,\nhe sought office repeatedly yet failed.\nThen, gazing heavenward, he sighed:\n*\"My heart still yearns—\nto seek the Supreme Dao, the Most Exalted,\nas a minister beneath the Jade Emperor’s throne,\nin the lofty halls of the Ten Thousand Clouds, the Left Palace of the Celestial Capital.\nHow much harder, then, to seek even a lowly official\nbeneath the worldly emperor’s rule—\nsuch a thing is so rare!\nThus, I abandoned Confucian texts\nand turned to the Dao, seeking a worthy teacher.*\n\n*First, I met Master Zhao of the Western Prefecture,\nand followed him as teacher, studying scriptures.\nMy voice chanted the rites of morning reverence—\nmy resolve never wavered.\nFor thirty-seven years,\nI grew ever more enveloped in murky ignorance,\nweakened by age, powerless to act.\nAgain, I sighed to Heaven:\n‘How fortunate that Heaven granted me this foolish body—\nI studied Confucianism, mastered its ways, yet gained no honor.\nI sought the Dao, my heart labored in vain, my wisdom never brightened.\nWas it not because my past virtues were meager,\nmy fate unkind?\nHow could I now grow old and die?’\n\nIn a sudden flash, I fainted and died.\nYet in death, I saw a woman of surpassing beauty,\nwho spoke to me, saying:\n‘You sought the Dao but lacked a true master.\nYou did not cultivate wisdom with iron resolve,\nnor temper your body like adamantine.\nYou toiled only over the Five-Colored Flower’s hidden teachings,\nsinging idle tunes, reciting frivolous words,\nlike a child playing with hollow syllables.\nYour path grows ever more distant from the Dao.\nIf you truly wish to attain it,\nabandon these ways and seek another path.\nGo to Mount Shaoshi,\nand find Master Jiuling—\nJiuling is the Lord Lao’s emanation.\nOr some say he is Master Wang’s disciple, the Lady of the Six Jia.’\n\n‘A mortal who cultivates meritorious deeds in secret\nmay now find the Dao complete—\nyet you must depart swiftly, not linger.’\n\nThus, Shi Cun awoke\nand journeyed to Mount Shaoshi,\nsearching for three months without success.\nYet with a pure heart, unwavering resolve,\nhe suddenly encountered an old man on the road—\nseventy or eighty years old, with snow-white hair,\nwalking like a tiger, strong enough to bear another man.\nShi Cun gazed long, recognizing him as a divine being,\nand hurried forward to bow in reverence.\nThe bystanders were astonished and asked:\n‘Why do you bow to this old man?’\nOne among them replied:\n‘When encountering a True Person, one must pay homage with haste.’\n\nThen Jiuling Master scolded:\n‘Why have you come so late?\nI wished to take you to Mount Wangwu,\nto pay respects to the Lady of the Six Jia.\nI have waited long—\nHeaven’s records have decreed\nthat I should instruct you in cultivating the Six Jia’s meritorious deeds,\nand prescribe the talismans to heal your body.\nYet you are already old—\nwhy did you not begin sooner?’\n\nShi Cun fell to the ground, kowtowing twice,\ndeclaring he had been reborn only to meet this master.\nHe begged:\n‘I humbly pray that the master teach me the art of immortality,\nso that my wretched body may endure.\nI would serve as your slave,\nregardless of years or months—\nonly grant me this life.’\n\nJiuling Master then led him into Mount Wangwu,\nand for three years,\ntaught him the method of *stepping the Celestial Halter and Earthly Measures*,\nto swallow the *Six Jia’s Soul-Soaring Scriptures*,\nand bestowed the *Twenty-Four Stages of the Earth’s Axis Talismans*,\nalways turning the Earth’s Axis and Heaven’s Gate.\nAfter fourteen years of secret cultivation,\nhis Dao was complete.\n\nHe then took a jar—\na vessel of two *sheng* capacity—\nwhich could contain the entire world beneath the Great Luo Heaven,\nwithin the Great Polarity’s embrace,\nand sealed it inside.\nOr the jar was the Six Jia’s encampment,\nand the *Scriptures of Qi-Sealing Arts* were its talismans,\nto transmit to mortals for cultivating meritorious deeds in secret.\n\nWas it not because his heart was most sincere\nthat the divine master took him as a disciple,\nand guided him to attainment?\n\nLater, he wandered the world for seven hundred years,\nuntil the Jin Dynasty, when Fei Changfang encountered him\nand learned the method of *shortening the Earth’s pulse*.\nFor three days, he hosted Fei in his jar to receive the teachings.\nUpon returning, three years passed,\nwhen one day, the Most Holy Jade Emperor of the Golden Threshold\nsent celestial maidens to welcome him,\nand he ascended to the rank of *Left Celestial Marshal*,\nakin to the worldly Grand Councilor.\n\nTruly, the Supreme Dao was fulfilled—\nhis wish to be granted the Celestial Marshal’s rank was answered.\n\n**The Third Rule of Yin Merits:**\nWhen the Dao’s power is manifest,\none observes the world—\nif malevolent spirits, poisonous dragons, or demons\nunleash raging winds and torrential rains,\nharming all beings, whether on land or sea,\none must tread the *Celestial Halter and Earthly Measures*\nthree times each, as described in the *Diagram of Stepping Heaven and Earth’s Measures*.\nDissolve into the *Yugbu Steps*—\nnine strides, twelve strides, or fifteen strides—\nand always align with the Heaven’s Gate.\nRaise the hand and point with three, six, or nine fingers.\n*Note: Some say three times—\nthe poisonous spirits will then cease,\nand no lives will be harmed.*\n\nSix strikes for illness,\nnine for imminent death—\ndo not recklessly invoke these prohibitions to kill,\nfor that is not the Dao.\n\nOne must first discern the truth—\nif harm is being wrought by malevolent spirits,\nand they act with demonic fury three or two times,\nthen all beings will be at peace,\nand only then may the *Step-Halter Method* be applied.\nThe demons will then cease.\n\nCease and release them—\ndo not kill outright.\nIf you kill, pluck the *dragon-spirit’s vital thread* from their demonic beasts—\nthe beasts will die within three days.\n\nLater, the Sage Monarch revealed the *Golden Lock, Flowing Pearl* manual,\nwhere all methods for subduing dragons and beasts are recorded.\nUse this to verify.\n\nThe Sage said:\n‘Do not act recklessly—\nthose who do will harm others’ lives,\nand bear guilt before all beings.\nIf beings are unsettled,\nor lives are lost to drought or flood,\nthe lawful method must be applied to execute judgment.\n*Note: The “Heaven’s Gate” cessation refers to the nine strikes—\nthis is the execution.*\n\nTo save one life and gain ten is called *double merit*.\nWhen three thousand are saved,\none ascends to Heaven in broad daylight.\n*Note: Regarding the wind, as recorded in the *Book of Jin* and *Strange Records of the Divine*,\nXu Xun served as the magistrate of Jingyang County,\nyet mastered the Dao of the *Yugbu Steps*.’",

Then, perform the *Yu Bu* (Flood Step) nine times, align with the *Pei Yi* (Configuring Garment) of the Seven Stars, turn the *Tian Guan* (Heavenly Lock), and point toward a specific village or household in a certain place. With three six nines (27) finger-pointings, summon the Six Generals of the Middle and Lower *Yuan* (Origins) to that person’s residence, commanding them to unleash water and fire, leading three hundred million troops as depicted in the diagram. If the Three Generals of the Middle *Yuan* are invoked from the *Liu Zhu Zhong Wai Pian* (Flowing Pearl Inner and Outer Chapters), they will arrive at the door to capture and exterminate the ghost, circling the residence with a great shout. Often, after three such invocations, the spirit will die, and the illness will abate. This *yin* virtue is also great, and the world will revere it.*\n\nThe sixth *yin* virtue: When a practitioner’s cultivation is complete, they may sit and rescue those thousands of miles away. With a talisman, they can save people in battle, binding it to a person’s body to ward off blades and swords, preventing harm. On a *Liu Jia* (Six Jia) day, one may invoke the *Liu Jia* deities, take three steps of the *Yu Bu* (nine traces), align with the *Pei Yi*, and point three times with the hand. This grants the *Xing Jun Huo Fu* (Marching Army Fire Talisman) and the *Dai Jue* (Bound Avoidance), ensuring the wearer will never be harmed by bandits. If a great general seeks to annihilate enemy forces for the state, they may be given the *Wan Sheng Shen Fu* (Ten-Thousand Victory Divine Talisman) to bind, rendering blades and swords powerless to harm.\n\nFor those commanding armies to strengthen the state, one may recite the *Di Ji* nine times, the *Fei Tian Gang* three times, disperse the *Yu Bu* in nine traces three times, twelve traces three times, and fifteen traces three times. Then align with the *Pei Yi*, turn the *Tian Guan*, and point toward the enemy’s direction nine times, pinching the *dao zhi* (claw support) of the person in that direction.\n*Note: If the enemy is in the East (Wood), use the Wood-person *dao zhi*; West (Metal), Metal-person *dao zhi*; South (Fire), Fire-person *dao zhi*; North (Water), Water-person *dao zhi*; Seasons (Earth), Earth-person *dao zhi*. Alternatively, one may also correspond with the Five Phases (Metal, Water, Wood, Fire, Earth) as needed.*\n\nThese two methods are the same. Additionally, sprinkle water in accordance with the direction, and the enemy will self-destruct. This method must be kept secret and not used recklessly. The ancient sage-kings revealed this method to save those who cultivate the Dao, aiding them in times of difficulty and assisting Daoist states in peril. It must not be used lightly—without proper mandate, even a moment’s misuse is forbidden.\n\nThe ancient sage-kings further instructed: *\"Realgar of a red hue—write the two *Da Jie* (Great Calamity) talismans, which are detailed in the *Li Fa* (Ritual Method). Also write the *Ru Jun Fu* (Entering Army Talisman) and the six *Liu Jia Yin Fu* (Six Jia Yin Talismans), binding them to the soldiers. In battle, they will suffer no injury for every ten thousand. These talismans are found in the *Liu Zhu Zhong Wai Pian* military methods.\"*\n\nThe seventh *yin* virtue: If the heavens endure prolonged rain without ceasing, and floods devastate the people—drowning villages, towns, and individuals—one may, in secret at night, recite the *Di Ji* three times and the *Fei Tian Gang* three times. Then disperse into the *Yu Bu* of nine traces, reaching twelve and fifteen traces, align with the *Pei Yi*, turn the *Tian Guan*, and point three times toward the darkest clouds. After three repetitions, issue a talisman to the local shrine, stipulating a specific day and hour for the rain to cease. If it does, pinch the *Long Mu* (Dragon’s Eye).\n*Note: The eye is on the left side of the second joint of the left hand’s index finger, near the claw nail. Pinch it urgently.*\n\nThe eighth *yin* virtue: If the heavens withhold rain for too long, caused by the *Kang Long* (Proud Dragon), and crops wither and die—unless this drought is a heavenly decree—\n*Note: If the drought is a heavenly command, do not act recklessly, lest you harm the Dragon’s mandate. The heavens punish the Dragon, and retribution follows naturally.*\n\nIf the drought is caused by the *Tu Di Long Shen* (Earthly Land Dragon Spirit) refusing to rain, one may, at night in an unoccupied courtyard, recite the *Di Ji* and *Fei Tian Gang* each three times, disperse into the *Yu Bu* of three steps and nine traces three times, align with the *Pei Yi*, turn the *Tian Guan*, and point three times toward a deep pool.\n*Note: The pool must contain dragons or water deities, the officials of the Water Palace, to ensure immediate efficacy and swift rain as urgent as fire.*\n\nAt dawn, write the *Zhi Ri Fu* (Direct Day Talisman) and the *Jiu Long Shui Fu* (Nine Dragons Water Talisman), affixing them to the local shrine and land gods.\n*Note: In ancient times, there were no *Cheng Huang* (City Gods); today, one must first invoke the City God officials and the land boundary shrine and water palace spirit officials, along with the Direct Day deity, to assemble the assembly and command the rain to fall at the appointed time. Urgently, as the law decrees. The deities will swiftly cause the rain to fall within the stipulated days, nourishing all rivers and streams, fulfilling the oath of hand and mouth.*\n\nThe Most High Lord Lao said: *\"I have transmitted this method to the world, so that those who cultivate the Dao may save others and achieve great merit. Those who save all under heaven will attain peace and joy beyond measure. This virtue is unfathomable, and those who uphold it will ascend the ranks of the immortals. This eighth virtue is what all sages and true ones have long kept in mind for those who earnestly study. Mastering this method and accumulating merit leads directly to the Dao.\n\nThe later sage-kings further transmitted the three *Long Fu* (Dragon Talismans), including the second method of the *Liu Jia Lu* (Six Jia Scriptures) and the talisman of the *Zhi Ri Shen* (Direct Day Deity).\"*",

      "translated_text": "「Annotation: Within the *Six Jia Scriptures*, the method is selected as follows: One talisman is used to summon the Dragon Talismans, in accordance with the law, swiftly as water and fire. The Dragon Talisman is invoked by the *Long Jue* (Dragon Decision), located on the left hand’s second finger at its first joint.\n\nThe Most High Lord Lao said: *\"Those who earnestly cultivate the Dao and seek verification must first understand this method of employing the Way to subdue dragons and enslave ghosts. Those who fail to grasp it will drift ever farther from the Dao, and must not presume to practice it. This method aids and assists the human body. I observe that in the present age, those who study the Dao merely take sound and image as the Dao.\n\nAnnotation: The wind carries the teachings of the ancient *Wu Wei* (Non-Action) Dao; now, they have entered the realm of *You Wei* (Action).\n\nNowadays, when people hear the Dao’s teachings, their ears and eyes are filled with devotion, and when they see its symbols, their hearts and spirits rise in faith. Though they may briefly awaken to goodness, their actions do not align with the Dao’s source, nor with the Dao itself. They merely labor at constructing mountains of merit that span the skies, only to exhaust themselves in vain and dissipate their efforts. Thus, the truly wise do not take sound and image as their instruction.\n\nThis is the hollow merit of the petty-minded, who vainly practice in the world. To recognize one’s true nature as *virtue* (德),—\n\nAnnotation: Lord Lao’s words here instruct the students, stating that in the present age, people mistake the forced cultivation of knowledge and true nature as the heart of *You Wei* (Action) virtue, rather than the natural virtue of *Wu Wei* (Non-Action). Throughout their lives, they exhaust themselves in futile, arduous striving. Such people, though the world may count them by the ten-thousand, will not achieve a single success. I often lament this, hence I have left ten conditions of hidden merit, and this is the foremost.\n\nIn the time of the ancient sage-king Shun, there was a drought lasting one hundred days. The emperor commanded his ministers to pray for rain. After fifty days, the sun’s midday heat scorched people with thirst and want, and many died—spread across all nine regions, with mountains blazing, grasses withering, and stones glowing like embers, making it unbearable for people to stand. Suddenly, two immortals arrived, and one sighed: *\"What kind of people are these, finding joy in such agonizing heat? Why?\"*\n\nThe other replied: *\"Let us pray for rain to descend.\"*\n\nThe immortal said: *\"Rain is the dragon’s movement; why should it concern your prayers?\"*\n\nThe official answered: *\"We pray that the dragon descends and moves to bring rain.\"*\n\nThe immortal asked: *\"Do you recognize the dragon?\"*\n\nThe official said: *\"I recognize it.\"*\n\nThe immortal then said: *\"Since you recognize the dragon, where is it? Why do you pray for its rain?\"*\n\nAt this, the officials knelt in unison, asking the immortal to indicate the dragon’s whereabouts. The immortal suddenly pointed at one man’s foot, and the dragon moved with tiger-like strides—\n\nAnnotation: The act of pointing with the hand is the turning of the Celestial Gate.\n\nThe man’s foot became the dragon’s and tiger’s steps, resembling the *Wu Bu* (Avoiding Steps) of today. After three strides, the immortal shouted: *\"Why does the dragon not move to bring rain?\"*\n\nAt that moment, the dragon bowed and said: *\"The Celestial Sovereign forbids rain for one hundred and eighty days. I have already twice secretly brought rain to save people, but both times I was summoned by the Underworld to report. This time, I dare not move, for if I do, I will be summoned, and my transgression will be heard by the Supreme Deity. The Celestial Talisman will descend to punish my body as a dragon.\"*\n\nThe immortal immediately sought paper and brush, writing a Celestial Talisman decree. He affixed it to the shrine deities and the dragon, commanding them to bring rain together. At that time, the shrine deities and the dragon, having received the decree, brought rain as ordered, and the limit was fulfilled within one day.\n\nAnnotation: Though the limit was fulfilled within one day, this method is too harsh. The dragon and deities, in their urgency to bring rain, must use violent winds and torrential downpours, uprooting trees. The immortal’s original intent was to secretly bring rain, but fearing that the Celestial Sovereign might forbid it and assign all the blame to the dragon, he ordered the storm to be swift. If the Celestial Sovereign did not punish the dragon, it would be spared. If he did punish it, the immortal feared damage to the dragon. At that time, the dragon was not punished, which was due to the immortal’s compassion, saving all beings in the world. Thus, the Celestial Sovereign did not blame the dragon. Instead, he rewarded the shrine deities, the dragon deities, and the eight departments of the river and sea spirits, granting them promotions. From then on, all of them thanked the immortal one by one.\n\nNow, if one obtains this method, the rain limit is set within three to five days, and this is already considered a great merit. Both the deities and the people rejoice, and according to the limit, the rain will be fulfilled, and promotions will follow. The merit’s efficacy lies with the Daoist master, who assesses the merit and may bestow rewards of wine and music.\n\nLater, there are three *Hui* (Assembly) days, where separate offerings are made to declare the merit’s efficacy.\n\nAnnotation: There is a method that does not require offerings; one simply submits the merit declaration and petition. This is not permissible. The three Assembly days are the days of the grand *Jiao* (Offering), when one must set up generals, officials, and soldiers, as if the world’s emperor commands his vassals and ministers, overseeing the three armies in a similar manner. Each year, these rites must be performed in spring and winter; failure to do so violates the imperial command. This is the *San Yuan Lu* (Three Primordial Scriptures), which takes the Three Primordial days for the offering, along with one petition and merit declaration. It is not necessary to submit all petitions and documents, lest they trouble the Supreme Deity and Lord of the Dao.\n\nThe ninth condition of hidden merit: The Most High Lord Lao instructed the male *Zhen Ren* (True Persons) like *Zhen Wang* (True King) Fang Ping and Han Fei Zheng, and the female *Zhen Ren* like Li the Lady, Wang the Lady, and the Lady of *Zi Wei* (Purple Micro), among the seventy-two great *Zhen Ren*, saying: *\"In the world, those who earnestly cultivate hidden merit must strive for the greatest deeds—none surpass saving people and aiding the poor, nor honoring the spirits of the dead and repairing tombs.\n\nAnnotation: The honoring of tombs refers to the ancient Yellow Emperor, who during his inspection of Mount Tai encountered a buried corpse whose coffin had been washed away by water, causing the earth to collapse and expose thousands of skeletal remains. The emperor, moved by the suffering of the common people, had them all collected and placed between four large boards, with the space taken from an uninhabited highland and buried in a deep pit. He then built a mound of earth three feet high, naming it a *fen* (tomb). After this, people followed the Yellow Emperor’s example. This burial method involved four large boards, isolating the four sides of the earth, and one large board placed above as a cover—this was the method of constructing tombs. Even to this day, people use coffins as boards and *guo* (outer coffins), adding new embellishments and calling them *mu* (graves).\n\nIn his dreams, the emperor saw over a thousand people come to thank him, saying: *\"Your Majesty governs the living with the Dao and the dead with virtue. Now, we, your subjects—over a thousand seven hundred in number—have been granted your celestial mercy. You provided shelter for our exposed bones, and we have already yesterday petitioned the Celestial Bureau, stating that we were blessed by your Majesty’s mercy in relocating and burying our remains. The Bureau has rewarded your Majesty’s deeds with double merit.\"*」",

Later, as foretold, he attained divine communion.\n\n**Annotation:** *Huangdi’s Original Chapter* records the method of erecting tombs and burying the dead to teach the world. When people learned this, their merit spread across the world, delighting gods and ghosts. After death, some with strong and wise spirits became celestial deities, earth deities, deities of the soil, or deities of grain, while the weaker became ghosts. Among ghosts, there were three ranks: superior, middle, and inferior.\n\nThe superior ghosts bestow blessings upon the virtuous and repay human kindness. The middle ghosts neither bless nor harm. These two ranks, if they attain rebirth early, are called *shan gui* (benevolent ghosts) in the retribution of human and heavenly realms. The Most High cherished them, forbidding those who received Daoist precepts from harming them, lest they lose the path to heavenly rebirth.\n\nThe inferior ghosts, however, constantly bring calamity, misfortune, and disease to the world. The Most High and the Sage Lords were enraged and often commanded Daoists to subdue and exterminate them with spells. Once subjected to Daoist judgment, their spirits were bound to the Northern Emperor’s dark and desolate peaks, imprisoned for years without resolution. Even if released, they could not be reborn as humans. Only those judged by the *Huai Tian* (Mars) were condemned to be reborn as venomous creatures—centipedes, scorpions, and snakes—dying a hundred times before being reborn once, never again as humans.\n\nWhen the human realm rejoiced, the hundred rivers and spiritual beasts presented auspicious diagrams, while the four seas’ dragons offered pearls and jade—was this not the virtue and divine communion of the Emperor’s hidden deeds?\n\nAgain, the Celestial Worthy instructed the ascetic practitioners of bitter austerity, such as Guo Jinqing, saying: *\"Your austerities save others, none greater than sowing merit. Its fruits will benefit future generations. I grant you treasures and firewood when you are in need—such deeds are vast and verifiable, leading to the Dao.\"*\n\nMoreover, he taught the forging of copper and iron into counterfeit gold and silver, taking only half the price—**Annotation:** *Half the price* means that genuine gold is worth ten *guan* per *liang* (ounce), but since counterfeit gold is made of copper or iron, one *liang* could be sold for half its value, yielding 2,500 in profit per *liang*.

      "translated_text": "「The **Grand Daoist Sage** of the **Central Realm**, **Zaiwang** of the **Great Perfection**, **Zhang Daoling**, **Zhao Sheng**, **Wang Chang** (the **Master of Command**), **Li Zhongfu**, **Mao Ying**, **Xu Yufu**, and others, were all later disciples who compiled and expounded upon the teachings. The **Daoist Sage** **Li Chunfeng** annotated them. Below, the **Six Jia** (注: *Six Jia* refers to the six celestial stems, 甲,乙,丙,丁,戊,己, symbolizing a cycle of Daoist practices) **Yin-Function** (Hidden Merit) is discussed.\n\n**Old Lord** (注: *Old Lord*, 老君, refers to **Laozi**, the revered Daoist sage and patriarch) instructed **Donglai Zi** (注: *Donglai Zi*, 東來子, is **Yu the Great’s** son):\n\n*\"Donglai Zi, you learned the Dao but did not practice **Yin-Function** (Hidden Merit), only **Yang-Function** (Manifest Virtue). Your craftsmanship was clever and refined—you built a tower in an empty wilderness, carving images of Daoist figures upon it, intending this as your lifelong virtue. You sought to rely on these merits to attain the Dao and transcendence. You claim that I have crafted over ten thousand merits for you, sufficient to make you a **Great Sage** (大仙).\n\nOne day, suddenly, two **Ming Officials** (注: *Ming Officials*, 二冥使, are underworld judges or messengers) summoned you to the **Gate of Tai Mountain** (太山門下), questioning why you constructed the tower, slaughtered living beings, and sacrificed them to spirits and ghosts in the rivers and wilds—countless oxen, pigs, sheep, donkeys, and other beasts. They said to you: *'Confess your crimes, or we shall bind your body and interrogate you further.'*\n\nYou replied: *'I submit to my transgressions and accept the blame for others.'* Then, I pardoned your offense.\n\nBut if you had not submitted, you would have been bound and punished. Your father had merit for managing the waters, now you are a **Tai Ji Perfected One** (太極真人), and cannot be cursed to bear the sin of killing. I shall reduce your father’s blessings to atone for your salvation, allowing you to return to the mortal world. If you now practice **Yin-Function** (Hidden Merit) to an extent surpassing others’ lifespans, you shall attain **perfected humanity** (成人), and for countless kalpas and lifetimes, you will no longer be sought by the underworld for retribution.\n\n**Donglai Zi** responded: *'I submit.'*\n\nUpon completion, the **Ming Official** truly consulted with **Tai Mountain Lord** (太山君), who released you from death, and you revived after seven days.\n\nAfterward, you always acted with sincerity, never harming living beings. You frequently used your own wealth to redeem the lives of the deceased, liberating them without limit. You often did this.\n\nOr, when people were imprisoned and bound, you would joyfully release them. Or, you would give food and clothing to those in jail.\n\nFor thirty years, those you had previously killed—oxen, sheep, pigs, donkeys, horses, and other livestock—all took rebirth as humans, forever free of resentment.\n\nBecause of these minor merits, you were favored by **Tai Shang Laozi** (太上老君), who revealed the **true teachings of Yin-Function** (Hidden Merit) to you, instructing you in the **steps of the Dao’s celestial principles** (天地纲纪之法) and granting you the **Six Jia merits** (六甲之功).\n\nOne day, suddenly, your **divine influence** (通神威) resonated with the heavens and earth, startling both mortals and immortals. **Old Lord** descended again, bestowing upon you the **Great Yin-Function** (大阴功).\n\nYou said: *'I have always been fond of constructing towers and altars, killing living beings to sacrifice to spirits and ghosts, intending this as a means to refine my body and seek the Dao.'*\n\n*(As recounted earlier.)*\n\nNow that the **Ming Officials** have informed you, you must reflect and repent. I shall now properly instruct you in **Yin-Function** (Hidden Merit). There are ten merits:\n\n1. **Wearing the Six Jia True Talisman** (服六甲真符) to heal bodily ailments.\n2. **True-heartedness** (真心), not causing harm or injury, not killing or wounding, not acting deceitfully or lustfully. *(注: Even if you have wives and concubines, do not arbitrarily change or defile others.)*\n3. **Avoiding falsehood, flattery, and theft**, abandoning the nine levels of evil and cultivating the nine levels of good.\n   - *One: Benevolence (慈),*\n   - *Two: Filial piety (孝),*\n   - *Three: Reverence in heart (心有敬),*\n   - *Four: Dignity in form (身有礼),*\n   - *Five: Practicing virtue (行仁德),*\n   - *Six: Sparing speech (少言语),*\n   - *Seven: Not acting before others (不为人之先).*\n     - *Even if you are greater than others, you must yield and let them act first, so as not to diminish your own virtue (德).*\n   - *Eight: Not harming spirits and ghosts unjustly (不妄害鬼神),*\n   - *Nine: Always cherishing the Dao (常怀学道).*\n4. **After attaining the Dao**, saving all beings.\n\n*(注: **Yan Qing** (昔嚴清) once reduced the weight of charcoal by three or four coins per measure when selling it to the poor, or gave one or two measures to those in need. For over thirty years, one day a **Jade Maiden** (玉女) descended to bestow ten volumes of talismans and scriptures, beginning with the **Six Jia**. She commanded **Yan Qing** to kneel and receive them, explaining each one and teaching him to cultivate the **Six Jia Talismans**. **Yan Qing** replied: *'I do not understand scriptures.'* The **Jade Maiden** said: *'You already understand the nine levels of Yin-Function (Hidden Merit), so why not study and learn to recognize the characters? Once you grasp the scriptures, you will succeed.'*\n\nThus, **Yan Qing** began reading history books. Though he did not recognize the characters, the **Jade Maiden** taught him. Unable to write, she taught him calligraphy. In three years, he mastered the scriptures, filling his mind with knowledge, and none could question him—he was a sage. He frequently practiced the merit of healing the people’s illnesses and passed this on to his disciples, who all took healing as their practice. At the time, it was called **Yan Jun’s Dao** (嚴君之道).\n\nLater, the **Holy Sage** (聖君) informed the **Heavenly Master** (天師):\n\n*'You instruct your disciples in practicing Yin-Function (Hidden Merit), which has two essentials:*\n   - *(注: One, the teacher must discern the disciple’s sincerity; two, the disciple must be filial to the teacher.)*\n   - *One: The teacher must first discern the disciple—whether they have sincerity or not, faith or not. *(注: In this age, many disciples have empty words but no sincerity. Such people must not be lightly trusted to pass on teachings.)* You must weigh their sincerity carefully; do not hastily judge them. If you judge them accurately, the teacher will not err, and you may then impart a minor stage of the Dao’s methods. If the disciple has a resolute heart and delights in the Dao, day and night thinking of the Dao and rejoicing in its truth, earnestly offering supplies, the teacher will measure their deeds according to the scriptures, reducing their faults to guide them in practicing Yin-Function (Hidden Merit).*\n   - *Two: The disciple must always know the teacher’s sincerity is true and upright, secretly invoking the Dao to honor the teacher. The teacher, in turn, will be moved and often reveal themselves to the disciple. The disciple will call upon the teacher, and the teacher will respond in their heart and mind, fulfilling all their deeds—except for the three rebellions. *(注: One, not rebelling against the sovereign’s words; two, not rebelling against the father’s instructions; three, not rebelling against the teacher’s guidance.)* These three prohibitions are the **Heavenly Master’s** instructions to **Wang Chang** and **Zhao Sheng**, passed on to disciples.*\n\n*Again, the **Heavenly Master** said: 'He who secretly guides others to attain the Dao’s highest truths and honors, is said to have a **heart of benevolent enlightenment** (心願啓善利人), known as **Yin-Function** (Hidden Merit), and as **practicing Yin-Virtue** (行阴德). The heavens reward such deeds, and their descendants will inherit this virtue through generations, never ceasing to hold official positions. *(注: If you guide others in good deeds—such as healing illnesses, delivering them from calamities and misfortunes—always act with sincerity, never committing evil, and frequently practice benevolence to save the nation and people, then your merits will be fulfilled, and you will ascend to immortality in broad daylight.)*'*",

      "translated_text": "If one secretly guides others toward evil, harming people and things, even if they guide them to the Dao’s highest truths and honors, it will never truly prevail. If they secretly guide others to act harmfully, damaging people and things, this is called **Yin-Plotting**, and is known as **practicing Yin-Treason** (行阴贼). The heavens abhor such deeds, and their descendants will surely suffer early deaths. *(Note: Even if descendants do not perish, they will still suffer illness, holding no office nor rank, and will be commoners.)*\n\nI now pass this teaching to you again, knowing you must act as a substitute teacher and instruct future generations. Do not harbor evil intentions—always speak with benevolence. *(Note: Benevolent speech is the voice of teaching; benevolent intentions are the heart’s practice.)* Benevolent intentions are supreme.\n\nThe **Celestial Master** told the **True Lord of the Northern Dipper**: \"When people secretly guide others, *(Note: guiding with benevolent speech and intentions, wishing to remove demons, evil spirits, and calamities of speech and illness—names unknown to mortals—one may secretly guide them, reciting softly and quietly so as not to be heard by outsiders. If heard, they may be spoken of by one person and spread by a hundred. It must not be heard, lest the Heavenly Tribunals remain unaware, and human rumors falsely transmit it as grievance. The spirits and gods know, fearing that in the clouds or at the Heavenly Gate’s three barriers, they may be intercepted by powerful spirits and gods. The Heavenly Gate’s petitions will not be permitted to reach the **Supreme Sovereign’s** presence, and the decree will descend to the Heavenly Tribunals.)* You must urgently petition the Heavenly Gate and address the **Jade Emperor**. If you wait for both the **Yin** and **Yang** talismans to arrive, you will be accused of grievance, and the **Yin Officials** and **Earthly Tribunals** will intercept you, preventing your petition from reaching the **Supreme Sovereign’s** presence. You must not wait for the **Yin** and **Yang** talismans. *(Note: Talismans are also called **Shi**.)*\n\nWhen people use proper petitions, idle memorials, and Heavenly Gate petitions, their tone, rhythm, and resonant speech are meant to be known by others. They then gather the **Earthly Tribunals’** and **Legal Talisman** armies, dispatching the **Yin-Yang Gods** of the **Six Jia** with two **Direct Talismans**, first petitioning the **Lord of the Northern Dipper**, who then relays it to the **Heavenly Gate’s** petitioner, only then reaching the **Celestial Master**. The **Celestial Master** is called **Release Teacher** in the **Laozi’s** poem, which the Buddha refers to as **Indra**. The later sage’s title is **Celestial Master**, surnamed **Zhang**, named **Ling**. After the **Celestial Master’s** decree is issued, it is directly conveyed to the **Supreme Sovereign’s** presence. Beware of the **Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water** falsely petitioning before the **Supreme Sovereign**, claiming: ‘So-and-so’s memorial contains falsehoods against the **Supreme Sovereign’s** boundless Dao.’ The **Supreme Sovereign, Laozi**, and the **Jade Emperor, the Way-Bearing Sovereign**, will not permit such petitions to pass. Be cautious. This is why the **Yin-Petition** to the **Heavenly Gate** exists.\n\nThe **Celestial Master** told the **True Person of Marvelous Conduct** *(Note: There are eight **Marvelous Conduct** figures; the true **Marvelous Conduct** bears the surname **Zhen**, named **Dingguang**):* \"When people study and understand the **Ten Grades of Yin-Function** and apply them to others, they will long endure in this practice. Within five or six years, they will attain **Divine Communication** and **Transcendence**. After achieving **Divine Communication**, they must only act benevolently to save others. As people accumulate their kindness, they will gradually be heard by the **Heavenly Tribunals**, and their petitions will reach the **Heavenly Gate** and the **Supreme Sovereign**. The **Supreme Sovereign** will rejoice and grant each petition, decreeing to the **Heavenly Officials**, who will then record their merits in the **Immortal Register**.

The **Six Jia Yin-Function Jade Girls**, the **Six Jia Lords**, and the **Northern Dipper Lord** will greatly resent this, turning it into misfortune for the transgressor. This is the meaning of **‘the fox assuming the tiger’s威’**—deceiving others for gain. The crime is twofold: first, the great crime of deceiving others; second, the harm done to the deceived person’s body and mind. Though originally free from calamity, they falsely petition the **Northern Dipper**, claiming misfortune, which is a false accusation against Heaven and Earth. The gods of the **Heavenly Gate** resent licentious worship and thus intercept the petition. Next, the finger-star of their original birth is implicated, and the person will instead incur guilt, suffer reduced lifespan, and be consigned to an evil path. If there is genuine calamity, one must still follow the **Northern Dipper’s** rites—any deviation is also transgression.

How much more could they then seek virtue and blessings?\n\nYou must understand this clearly: As a disciple instructed in the **Rectified-One’s Three Primordial Talismans**, do not indulge in **licentious sorcery** or deceive the world. Only by adhering to the **Six Jia’s merit** will one naturally attain the Dao without deviation.\n\nThe **Venerable Lord** said: This is called the **\"Ten Yin-Mercies of the Six Jia\"**—those who practice must treasure and conceal it, for only by following this will one naturally attain the Dao.\n\n---\n**The *Six Jia Ling Shu* (Sacred Scriptures of the Six Jia) – Yang-Merits**\nThere is also the *Six Jia Ling Shu*, which expounds on **yang-merits**, comprising ten sections.\nHere, the ten precepts are briefly recorded. *[Note: Fully elaborated in *The Transmission of the Venerable Lord*.]*\n\n1. **Broadly gathering causes and conditions**, assembling congregations, constructing earthen and wooden pavilions and halls—accumulating merits numbering in the ten-thousands—this is called **yang-merit**, uncounted among the yin.\n   The **Sage Sovereign** said: Such a person, in a future life, will become an official, possess wealth and grand halls, with prosperous descendants yet no noble status.\n\n2. **Observing fasts and reciting scriptures**, accumulating merits numbering in the ten-thousands—this is called **yang-merit**, uncounted among the yin.\n   The **Lord** said: In a future life, one will be endowed with wisdom, with clear and upright ears and eyes, having virtuous sons and daughters who are filial, and attaining official rank.\n\n3. **Exhorting others to do good**, prompting almsgiving, and donating wealth numbering in the ten-thousands—this too is **yang-merit**, uncounted among the yin.\n   The **Lord** said: In a future life, one will become a leader among people, the chief of those who consume flesh, with descendants inheriting this status across generations.\n\n4. **Acting with sincere devotion and labor**, broadly constructing earthen and wooden structures, erecting frameworks for halls and temples, and rigorously clearing mountain paths—this too is **flourishing merit**, uncounted among the yin.\n   The **Lord** said: In a future life, one will be reborn as a male, holding an official position with wealth, slaves, and servants at their command, with prosperity lasting two generations—yet afterward, one’s station will decline. The **Great Dao forbids such ambition**.\n\n5. **Casting and crafting bells and statues**, completing the merit of becoming an immortal—where statues manifest the transient goodness of mortals—this too is **yang-merit**, uncounted among the yin.\n   The **Lord** said: In a future life, one will be skilled in song and music, with a well-proportioned body, yet lacking in wealth and sustenance.\n\n6. **Reciting incantations idly**, invoking them loudly and calling out to chastise ghosts and spirits—even if it saves a person—this is **yang-merit**.\n   The **Lord** told the **Celestial Master**: Though this merit is not fully attained, it still emerges from the body, yet because the chastisement is excessive, in a future life one will suffer few illnesses but lack descendants.\n\n7. **Digging wells along roads and rivers**, providing water and gruel—this too is **yang-merit**.\n   Though this act benefits others, it aligns with **yin-speech of merit**, as it is said, *\"So-and-so dug this well.\"*\n   The **Lord** said: Such a person’s descendants will receive half of the yin-merit, while the individual attains yang-merit, transforming into benevolent deeds that aid those in urgent need.\n\n8. **Leveraging official authority or borrowed strength to rescue others from罪**, this too is **yang-merit**.\n   The **Lord** said: In a future life, one will receive blessings, or perhaps reap rewards in this very life—this is the merit of **auspicious yang**.\n\n9. **Constructing bridges and causeways**, facilitating passage and transit—this too is **yang-merit**.\n   The **Lord** said: In a future life, one will constantly benefit from the kindness of travelers.\n\n10. **Receiving ordination and taking vows**, with a pure mind and spirit, abstaining from marriage, and dwelling in high mountains—this too is **yang-merit**.\n   The **Lord** said: In a future life, one will attain the Dao of **non-action**.\n\n---\nThese ten are called the **\"Ten Yang-Merits\"**, uncounted among the yin.\nIn the past, the **Highest True Ones** and **Ascended Immortals** all practiced **yin-merits and yin-virtues**, unlike the ten recorded histories of the ten yang-merits.\n\nIn antiquity, the **Divine Ancestor and Sage Sovereign** served as **Three Pillars of History** in the **Yin and Zhou dynasties**, as **Chancellor and Minister** for sixty-four sovereigns over seven hundred and fifty-one years. Then, crossing westward through the pass into the **Barbarian lands**, *[as transmitted:]* he had eighty-four wives and two hundred and forty children. *[As recorded in the Inner Transmission.]*\nHe transformed the **Barbarian King into a Buddha-Immortal**, later ascending to become the **Emperor of the Golden Gate of Great Peace, the Morning Star of the Supreme Dao, the Posterior Sage, and the Primordial Lord of the Mysterious Origin**. His successors continued practicing **yin-merits**, accumulating **yin-virtues**, and teaching the **Dao of Non-Action** without relying on those who dwell in mountains and forests.\n\nOver time, ascending ever higher, past, present, and future lives—\n**receiving unbroken blessings from virtuous deeds**—\n*[End of the Nineteenth Volume of *The Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl*]*\n*[Beginning of the Twentieth Volume of *The Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl*]*.",

One must align the individual’s **native star** with the day’s constellation, beginning from the first day and concluding on the thirtieth. Each month’s sequence is matched accordingly.\n\nThe **Supreme Primordial Lord Laozi**, having received instruction from the **Primordial Dao Lord Yuan Shi**, recorded this as the *Scripture of the Twenty-Eight Constellations*, comprising twelve volumes and two hundred sheets—its vastness making it difficult to fully explore.\n\nLater, the **Sage Emperor** descended from **Nanshan** (now **Zhongnan Mountain**), in the **thirteenth year of the Great Achievement** (617 CE), revealing to the **Tang Dynasty’s Li clan**, who ruled under Heaven. Now, this abridged version of the *Twenty-Eight Constellations Scripture* is compiled to correspond with the thirty days of each month, demonstrating how to correlate and observe one’s **native star** to discern prosperity or decline.\n\nThus, the **Edict of Edging Through** is condensed into essential principles, teaching humanity to record and reflect upon it.\n\nThe **Supreme Primordial Lord Laozi** declared:\n*\"For those cultivating longevity, knowing one’s **native star**—the constellation governing one’s birth—is paramount. The **wandering star** is the constellation of one’s life’s destiny.\n\nIf the **native star** aligns perfectly in its proper position, yet a **wandering star** intrudes upon it, this is most malevolent, bringing great calamity. If only the **wandering star** intrudes, the consequences are lighter.\n\nThese two matters must be carefully observed: if the star is bright, misfortune will not befall; if it is dim, illness and disaster will arise. One must act swiftly, invoking talismans and rituals to dispel them, thereby eliminating sickness and averting decline.\n\nOn one’s **native star’s day**, if the night is clear, observe it secretly when no one is about. If it is bright and clear, it is auspicious; if dim or flickering, disaster is near; if unseen, great misfortune looms.\n\nThen, recite the **Earth-Treading Step** and the **Heavenly Halter** each three times, perform the **Yugaitian Steps**, and turn the **Heavenly Pass**. Point toward the direction of the afflicted person’s **star of decline or ghostly abode**—for all are born into regions of calamity.\n\nFor instance, a **Metal-born** individual has:\n- **Longevity** in **Si (Peril)**,\n- **Bathing** in **Wu (Boiling)**,\n- **Crowning** in **Wei (Encirclement)**,\n- **Official Duty** in **Shen (Apply)**,\n- **Sovereignty** in **You (Jade)**,\n- **Decline** in **Xu (Empty)**,\n- **Sickness** in **Hai (Hide)**,\n- **Death** in **Zi (Self)**,\n- **Tomb** in **Chou (Rest)**,\n- **Ruination** in **Yin (Conceal)**,\n- **Severance** in **Mao (Insult)**.\n\nIf any of the **Five Phases’** stars fall into these regions of decline, regardless of whether the **native star** is visible, decline will manifest. One must act to dispel it.\n\nPerform this ritual **three times monthly**. If the star remains bright, one will have no worries—disasters and calamities will vanish.\"*",

Those who know this method may follow its principles, saving themselves first and then ten others.\n\nBut among the **Twenty-Eight Constellations**, each constellation governs countless billions of people beneath it. If one practices this method, they may save a hundred souls, yet the world remains unaware—how much more so for saving just one life or a few relatives and friends, who would still be saved. Yet people remain ignorant, openly receiving the **Ming** (dark) commands from the celestial agents, who come to summon them to death—this is truly a grievous fate!\n\nThose dwelling at the edges of the heavens beneath the native star will also suffer hundreds or thousands of deaths.\n\nThose who cultivate life and preserve their bodies must always observe their native star’s position in the **Twenty-Eight Constellations**, to discern the signs of their own rise or decline. This Dao is of utmost importance: without cause, one’s body will not decline or fall ill.\n\nMoreover, when the star is bright and clear, one need not perform the **步蹑 (Bujie)** steps or the **祭醮 (Jijiao)** rituals. If they do, they will instead invite disasters and calamities upon their entire household, not just themselves.\n\nThe **Laozi (Lao Jun)** has universally commanded this prohibition, and those in **white robes** (laypersons) do not accept it, while those who invert the Dao (false teachers) often allow the **天关 (Tian Guan)** agents to turn and point at the native stars of people.\n\nThe later sage-emperor declared: *\"White robes do not accept\"* refers to those who invoke the **七星 (Qi Xing, Seven Stars)** or **六甲 (Liu Jia, Six Jia)** in the *金锁流珠 (Jin Suo Liu Zhu)* scriptures and borrow from teachers—those who falsely claim to teach, yet write out entire texts without proper transmission, or even if they receive them, do not verify with the teacher’s seal or voice, or lightly assume the teacher’s authority, or have the teacher’s name appended without genuine transmission—such are the crimes of **罔师 (Wang Shi, false teaching)**, and they will not die naturally.\n\nHow much worse for those who further seek this Dao, yet fail to attain peace even for themselves! The deceivers of the Dao are known to the **三官 (San Guan, Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water)**, who will surely report them to the **道祖 (Dao Zu, Daoist Patriarch)**, and the **天师 (Tian Shi, Celestial Master)** will be notified. Both the patriarch and the master will censure these deceitful thieves of the Dao, and their entire families will be struck down by Heaven’s punishment, dying unnatural deaths.\n\nIn ancient times, there was a man named **张山子 (Zhang Shanzi)**, whose given name was **初见 (Chu Jian)**.

      "translated_text": "「If one possesses this book and reveres it with a single-minded devotion, never failing in its observances, yet after five years of practice, the **Celestial Master (天師)** still does not press his seal upon it—if he instead secretly uses the **San Guan (三官)**’s talismans of *Shuangxian Guan (天纲)* and *Dieji Guan (地紀)*, mastering the art of divine communication—then the transmission will never cease for a thousand years.\n\nWhen the **Xiao Wang Fu Ren (小王夫人)** saw this, she did not consider it a flaw but allowed him to proceed. Suddenly, one day, she was in her mountain retreat (*shanfang jing, 山房靖*) when seven men clad in garments of five colors appeared, claiming to be **heavenly emissaries (天使)**, sent to investigate **Zhang Shanzi (張山子)** for the crime of **stealing the Dao (盗道)**.\n\nThe **Xiao Wang Fu Ren** asked: *“What crime does he have?”*\n\nThe emissaries replied: *“The crime of **Wang Shi (罔師)**, stealing the Dao.”*\n\nThe **Xiao Wang Fu Ren** instructed them to have **Zhang Shanzi** write the *Jin Suo Liu Zhu (金鎖流珠)* scripture and the *Liu Tian (六式九符)* talismans, all paid for with silk, money, silver, and gold to a certain **Bu Ren (某乙)**. **Bu Ren** then petitioned the name of an **immortal (上仙)**, and only then did the writing commence. Once finished, the texts were passed along to the **Chu (楚) man Bo Yue (葛越)**, who received them in the same hall, and then departed.\n\nThe seven emissaries questioned the **Xiao Wang Fu Ren**, asking if she had sealed the talismans.\n\nThe **Xiao Wang Fu Ren**, pondering, recalled that he had left without receiving the immortal’s seal. The emissaries declared: *“This alone is the crime of **Wang Shi (罔師)**, stealing the Dao. Heaven commands his punishment.”*\n\nThe **Xiao Wang Fu Ren** fully realized the gravity of his failure to seal the texts. If he had received them and later defied the Dao, the guilt would have extended to her, and she would have been demoted to a lower stage of **Daoist rank (師階)**. She would then have suffered for a hundred years in the mortal realm, unable to ascend.\n\nNow, because of his own actions, he has incurred this punishment. He falsely claims that I am **Li Si Ming (李司命)**, the **Zhong Fu (仲甫)**, and refuses to accept this law. How could I, a **Daoist Master (師)**, accept the law from a woman’s hands? Even the households of **kings and nobles (王侯)** would not dare speak thus.\n\nWe, the seven, then went to **Songgao Mountain (嵩高山)**, to investigate **Bo Yue (葛越)**. His response was the same as that of the **Xiao Wang Fu Ren**.\n\nWe reported this to the **Supreme Sage (後聖君)**, who was enraged. How could he have knelt before a woman at that time, bowing to her as his master?\n\nNow, because of his defiance of the Dao, this is the crime of **Wang Shi (罔師)**, stealing the Dao. We were ordered to afflict him with illness, but we feared that the **Xiao Wang Fu Ren** might seal these talismans for him, using the law to rectify the situation. If she did so, it would implicate him in another crime, burdening her as well.\n\nThus, the **Supreme Sage (太上)** commanded us to question the **Xiao Wang Fu Ren** again.\n\nThe **Xiao Wang Fu Ren** answered: *“Indeed, I did not seal them.”*",

      "translated_text": "「When the celestial emissary was about to depart, he next declared: *“I am the **Supreme Marshal of the Northern Dipper (Northern Dipper Marshal)**, as well as the envoy of the **Twenty-Eight Constellations (Twenty-Eight Mansions)**. The **Supreme Sage (Taishang Xuan Yuan Shang Dao Jun)**** had instructed me to descend and investigate; this matter is not trivial. The **Xiao Wang Fu Ren** has indeed not sealed these talismans for all concerned—she rejoiced, and she rejoiced again.”*\nHaving spoken, he left.\n\nWithin half a year thereafter, **Zhang Shānzǐ (張山子)**, dwelling on **Mount Tai Bai (太白山)**, saw his entire household afflicted by an epidemic plague, all perishing—even to the last fowl and beast, all slain by **demonic forces (鬼)**. Thus, **Feng (風)** searched within the *Inner Transmission of the Mother and Daughter (Amu Xiaonü Neichuan)* and found its composition, intending to instruct the world.\n\nLet mortals be cautious not to act thus with **intentionality (行心)**, lest they betray their **master (師)** below and deceive the **Dao (Way)** above, and thus be struck down by heaven. How much more so if they seek the **Dao (Way)** itself! The **Dao (Way)** and its laws are impartial, allowing no transgressions. The **Great Dao (Way)** is without bias, taking only those who are without fault. The **Great Dao (Way)** is without favoritism, not permitting mortals to deceive one another. The **Dao (Way)** and its laws are without deceit, forbidding the disrespect of **masters (師)**. As noted before, do not repeat such offenses.\n\nSuch crimes must be heeded by those who study the **Dao (Way)**. The **Supreme Sage (Laojun)**** then told the **Forty-Nine True Persons of the Highest Grade (上品四十九真人)**: *“This **Northern Dipper Marshal (北斗君)** is the overseer of the **Four Cardinal Mansions (四方宿)**. He governs the affairs of the **Eighteen Constellations (十八宿)**; all matters are known to him first, and he does not allow lesser constellations to act as their superiors. For those who are **filial (孝)** yet defy the **Dao (Way)**, betray their **master (師)**, and rebel against their **lord (君)**, failing to honor their parents, even if they seek vengeance in this lifetime, their **crimes (罪)** will be repaid in the depths of time by the **celestial laws (日月)**—their punishment will be swift as **water and fire (水火)**, yet they will still not escape their fate.”*\nBe cautious, be cautious.\n\n**Daoist Rituals (醮祭) for the Northern Dipper and Twenty-Eight Constellations to Invoke the Celestial Laws (日月時法)**\n**Laojun (老君)** said: *“Those who practice the **Dao (Way)** and perform **rituals (醮祭)** must follow the **Five Marshal Laws (五斗君法)**. All must abide by the **scripted rites (科仪)** and observe the **auspicious times of the moon, day, and hour (月日时)**.”*\nThe *Scripture of Illuminating Truth (Mingzhen Ke)* states: *“In the **Spring (春)**, the **First Month (正月)** has the **Native Star Day (本命日)**; in **Autumn (秋)**, the **Seventh Month (七月)** has the **Native Star Day (本命日)**; in **Winter (冬)**, the **Tenth Month (十月)** has the **Native Star Day (本命日)**. The **hour (更)** should be the **second watch (二更时)** when the **stars and moon are clear (星月明朗)**—this is supreme. If not, then the **ritual platform (坛)** should be moved beneath the **house (屋)**, spread with **yellow earth (黄土)** to form the **platform (坛)**, shaped according to the **land’s contours (随地关挟长短曲直)**. Light **dozens of lamps (数十灯)** to illuminate the platform, mirroring the **intent of stars and moon (月星之意)**.”*\n\nThe **Supreme Sage (Taishang Jun)**** then told the **Celestial Master (天師)**: *“You wish to perform **rituals (醮祭)**. Within the **Daoist scriptures (道法箓)**, the **Generals of the Five Pecks (五斗)**, the **Celestial Officials (仙灵官)**, and **Taiyi (太一)** and **Eryi (二仪)**, the **Three Elements (三元)** and **Four Seasons (四时)**, the **Five Phases (五行)** and **Six Celestial Stems (六甲)**, as well as the **Seven Stars (七星)** and **Twenty-Eight Constellations (二十八宿)**, all must be invoked during the **Spring, Autumn, or Winter (春秋冬)** **First Month (孟月)**, on the **Native Star Day (本命日)** or a **selected auspicious day (吉日)** that harmonizes with their **Native Star (命)**. The ritual must be conducted under **clear skies (晴明)**—if **wind, thunder, clouds, or rain obscure the sun (风雷云雨星宿不见日)**, it is **inauspicious (凶)**. You previously chose a day, but I fear that **nighttime wind, rain, or clouds (夜风雨云)** may darken the **earthly coordinates (蹑地纪)**. Thus, the **Heavenly Mandate (天纲)** must be invoked in **three sequential (顺)、inverted (倒)、and reversed (反)** cycles. Upon completion, disperse in **Yubu Steps (禹步)**—three steps, nine traces—and don ritual attire. Point diagonally toward the **direction of wind and rain (云雨之处)**; if the timing is right, the **ritual will open (应时有开)**. Then **twist the talisman (捻诀)**, holding the **fire knife (火刀)** upright. The **second phalanx of the left hand’s middle finger (左手第二指第三节)** points to the right.\n\nThe **incantation (咒)** reads:\n*“I wish to cultivate and practice, invoking the **Five Pecks and Thirty-Five Stars (五斗三十五星)**. Today is my **Native Star Day (本命日)**—may the **clouds gather and rain cease (仰云收雨)**, the **wind still (静风)**, and the **seven luminaries (七曜) shine brightly (朗明)**. Swiftly, swiftly, as the **Heavenly Laws decree (如律令)**.”*\n**Immediately, the skies will clear (须臾即晴)**.",

We were ordered to afflict him with illness, but we feared that the **Xiao Wang Fu Ren** might seal these talismans for him, using the law to rectify the situation. If she did so, it would implicate him in another crime, burdening her as well.\n\nThus, the **Supreme Sage (太上)** commanded us to question the **Xiao Wang Fu Ren** again.\n\nThe **Xiao Wang Fu Ren** answered: *“Indeed, I did not seal them.”*",

      "translated_text": "This too is the words of **Lǎojūn (老君)**.\n\nIn ancient times, **Fúxià Zǐ (伏夏子)**, the younger brother of **Fúxī (伏牺)**, cultivated the **Dao/Way** and attained immortality. While studying in the mortal realm, he took a small bamboo flute and blew it, imitating the **Fèng (凤)** phoenix’s voice—this is the origin of the **shēng (笙)**.\n\nA **celestial immortal** descended to observe him. Afterward, the immortal informed **Fúxià Zǐ**:\n*\"You are in danger of military calamity.\"*\n\n**Fúxià Zǐ** rose and bowed twice, then asked how to avert the military peril. The immortal replied:\n*\"You may use **Lónghuí (龙回)**, which is the step of the **Earthly Stems (蹑地纪)** method for breaking formations. **Hǔtiào (虎跳)** is the step of the **Fēigāng (飞钢)** today. **Yǐnxīng (引星)** corresponds to the **configuring of ritual garments (配衣)** now. **Zhuǎnshā (转杀)** is done at the fingertips—this is the **Celestial Gate (转天关)** of today. **Cóngjī xiànghuài (从基向坏)** refers to the **foundational alignment (即今之日月建地)** and its **dissolution (即今之日破地)**.\n\nThe strategies of martial masters for calculating **isolated and empty formations (孤虚)** resemble these methods, and they are highly reliable. Those of old who were **divine sages (神人)** all employed them. When used correctly, they yield victory.\n\nAfter **Fúxià Zǐ** learned these methods, he used them to rescue those in **genuine distress (急难)** who practiced the **Dao/Way**. **Lǎojūn (老君)** said:\n*\"For **Daoist companions (道友)** and **inner kin (内亲)**, surrounded by bandits and facing annihilation—if one can devise a plan to save them, they should employ the **Earthly Stems (金地纪)** method in motion: forward, backward, and reverse, three times. Then configure the ritual garments (**配衣**), turn the **Celestial Gate (转天关)**, and ninefoldly point with the fingers (**指之**). Additionally, grasp the **military talisman (兵符)**, pointing it nine times. Twist the **bandit’s command (贼某命人刀支)**—the **Sword-Support (刀支)** of the **wood-directional bandit (东来木人)** is marked with **metallic-white (金白)**, the **gold-directional bandit (西来金人)** with **flaming-red (火赤)**, the **water-directional bandit (南来水人)** with **earthly-yellow (土黄)**, the **fire-directional bandit (北来火人)** with **water-black (水黑)**, and the **earth-directional bandit (四季上来者土人)** with **bamboo-green (木青)**. The four seasons are represented by **chén, xuǔ, chǒu, wèi (辰戌丑未)**.\n\nWhen twisting the **Sword-Support (刀支)**, use the hand corresponding to its direction. Then, apply the color as described. Afterward, take out the **military talisman (兵符)** and point it nine times at a distance. The bandits’ resolve will collapse, and they will retreat, lifting the siege without harming your **inner kin (反亲)**. If they refuse to retreat, the **shadow army (阴军)** will strike them, and they will mutually slaughter and destroy each other until none remain.\n\nThis method is subtle and of utmost secrecy—do not reveal it to anyone unworthy.\n\nThe **Later Sage Sovereign (后圣君)** told the **Celestial Master (天师)**:\n*\"This talisman is for military use—both to aid the nation in battle and to rescue **Daoist companions (道友)** and one’s own life. There is a talisman, the **Tiger King Talisman (虎王符)**, forged from **gold and copper (金铜)**, measuring either two inches or one and a half inches. The **Celestial Master (本师)** must consecrate and empower it. Then, store it in a **brocade pouch (锦袋)**, ensuring no one ever sees it. Only four may behold it: the **Celestial Master (本师)** and the **protector of the Master (保举师)**. If the protector fails or is struck down remotely, the talisman’s power will vanish, and it will never be seen again. The second category includes **sovereigns receiving subjects (君受臣)** and **subjects receiving sovereigns (臣受君)**. The third are **fathers receiving sons (父受子)** and **sons receiving fathers (子受父)**. The fourth are **husbands and wives (夫妻)**. Others must never see it.\n\nIf **Daoist companions (道友)** or **inner kin (内亲)** wish to carry it for healing, seal it tightly and give it to the sick person. The illness will immediately abate. If the sick person secretly examines it, the illness will flare up, and they will die without fail.\n\n**Out-Military Talisman (出军)**\nIf one personally leads an army and is besieged, and the troops break through the enemy’s formation, the talisman must be tied to the **left elbow (左肘)**. There is another talisman, the **White Tiger Talisman for Breaking Strong Formations (白虎破强阵符)**, also forged from **gold and copper (金铜)**, measuring one and a half inches. Its method of use is the same as the previous talisman’s annotations. All talismans are cast from **gold and copper (金铜)**—the **in-military talisman (入军符)** is tied to the **left elbow (左)**, and the **out-military talisman (出军符)** to the **right elbow (右)**.\n\nTogether with the **ritual postures and prohibitions (并式禁制)**, and the **spirit of the talisman (加临相助)**, one will inevitably achieve victory. The enemy will collapse like a mountain—this is highly effective. Do not reveal it to anyone unworthy.\n\n**Lǎojūn (老君)** said:\n*\"In ancient times, the **Western Hu (西胡)** had a great king who loved the **Dao/Way**. I instructed him through the **Hu Immortal (胡仙)**, and he changed his name to **Fó (佛)**—a different name for **celestial immortal (仙)**. The Hu called him **Fó**.\n\nThe Four **Celestial Realms (天国)** did not submit, each fielding **strong armies (强兵)** of four hundred thousand men. They surrounded this king’s realm, layer upon layer. The king begged for deliverance but refused to comply. His **true heart (正心)** and **sincere intent (思存)** were evident—I saw him in the void, calling for my aid.\n\nI used the **Earthly Stems (蹑地纪)** to scatter radiance, the **Yǔbù (禹步)** to turn the **Celestial Gate (关)**, and pointed three times. Then, I released a **military talisman (出军一符)** toward the Hu king’s desk. The king saw it, tied it to his **left elbow (左手肘)**, and later opened the city gates to battle. Those who fought against this king all fell backward, and the enemy armies were utterly defeated, slaughtered by the city’s defenders.\n\nIn but a moment, the **heavens and earth (天地)** grew enraged, and thunderous winds shook the heavens and earth. White rain descended, annihilating the Four **Celestial Armies (天军)**. The armies and their king scattered and fled back to their own lands, unharmed in their positions.\n\nThus, the **virtue/power (力)** of this talisman is supreme. Guard it carefully—do not let anyone unworthy see it. If they do, both parties will face retribution, and the **Heaven’s great wrath (天大威)** will bring death. This is no trivial matter—be cautious, be cautious.\n\n**The Method of the Red Chapter for Aiding the Nation and Subduing Bandits (赤章助国伐贼法)**\n**Tàishàng Lǎojūn (太上老君)** said:\n*\"Rescue is the **virtue/power (功)** of aiding the nation in subduing bandits, saving the nation from difficulty. When **kings and emperors (国王帝主)** dispatch great ministers to attack rebellious bandits, but are instead besieged—if one is a **master of martial law (掌法)** and a **true Daoist (志道之人)**, they should aid the nation in its salvation.\n\nUse the **Red Chapter (上赤章)** to summon the **Heavenly Armies (天兵)**, turn the **Celestial Gate (转天关)** to rescue them—swift as water or fire in urgency. If the nation’s strong bandits retreat, with neither side harmed, this is the highest outcome.\n\nIf the bandits are **strong and unyielding (强梁不伏)**, petition the **Heavenly Sovereign (天公)**—now called **Yùhuáng Dìshàng (玉皇上帝)**—and write their crimes. This is **Heaven’s retribution (天施功)**. If the **virtue/power (功)** is great and **Heaven does not strike (天不伐)**, the act of **subduing and killing (蹑杀)** will instead be recorded as the **hidden merit (阴功)** of saving people.\n\n**Nurturing and protecting all beings (安养人物)**.\nThis pleases **Heaven greatly (此天大喜)**, and **Heaven will devise a plan (与计)** for the **hidden merit (阴功)**.\n\nLater sages changed this to the **Red Chapter (赤章)**—a **chapter of petition against traitors (章奏反臣章)**—saying, *'Tàixuān Dū (泰玄都)' and so forth.\"*",

This is the case when two individuals inform Heaven of their own wrongdoings, and the punishment is swift—within moments, disciples may rebel against their teacher, or teachers may invoke the **灵官 (Spiritual Official)** to petition against their own students.\n\nThis petition is originally recorded in the *Dà Zhāng Yí* [Great Ritual Code], now further inscribed here for reference. The Sage Sovereign summons the **Spiritual Official** to subdue disciples and malevolent commoners who, through **孤恩 (isolated kindness)** and **负道 (betraying the Dao/Way)**, invoke the Spiritual Official to dissolve the petition and restore illness—just as in the original petition.\n\nThe *Zá Zhāng Yí* [Miscellaneous Ritual Code] contains this, so it is not written again; its contents have already been listed.\n\n**Issuing Talismans and Ritual Edicts to Restrain the Three Officials’ Malevolent Forces**\n\nAmong the **三官 (Three Officials)**—Heaven, Earth, and Water—there are malevolent forces and malevolent individuals: **神龙 (Divine Dragons)**, **鬼精 (Ghostly Spirits)**, and **妖 (demons)** are such.\n\nThe Heavenly Master said: *\"The petitioner is **罗文能强 (Luo Wen Nengqiang)**.\"* His surname is **罗 (Luo)**, his given name is **文能 (Wen Neng)**, and his courtesy name is **强 (Qiang)**.\n\n*\"As for mortals, they are the most honored among the **三才 (Three Powers)**—Heaven, Earth, and Humanity.

      "translated_text": "The **Grand Sovereign of the Celestial Masters of China**, **Zǎiwáng Fāngpíng Zhāng Dàolíng**, along with **Zhào Shēng, Wáng Cháng, Sīmìng Lǐ Zhòngfǔ, Máoyíng, Xǔ Yùfǔ**, and others, compiled and transmitted this across generations.\n\n**Lǐ Chúnfēng**, the Daoist Sage of China, annotated the **Method of Writing Talismans, Exorcising Evil, and Treating Illnesses**.\n\nThe **Most High Lord Lao** spoke to **Luò Tiānshī**, saying:\n*\"If you wish to perform hidden merit, nothing surpasses granting talismans. The highest merit is to heal demonic illnesses—saving one person earns the merit of ten. For those afflicted by demonic illness enter households, disturbing both people and things. When one falls ill, they can disrupt an entire village, tormenting ten households. Thus, saving ten earns tenfold merit.\n\nBy severing the vital essence of demonic ghosts, spirits, and malevolent *qi*, their lives are not taken as punishment but as merit earned.\n\nLater, the **Sage Emperor** spoke to **Zhang Tiānshī**, saying:\n*'When you treat people’s illnesses and their afflictions are cured, if the demon is condemned to be slain, it is not a crime but merit earned. If it was not a demon but you recklessly issued a summons and executed it, you risk inviting disaster—this would be a grave and unjust offense. You, teacher and disciples, must pass on the teaching with caution and never do such things. My Dao has no pardon for this.*\n\n**Laozi** said:\n*'To prohibit and restrain celestial foxes so they no longer torment humans and Heaven, you must obtain the name of the afflicted person. Then, pinch the celestial demon’s eye—even celestial foxes can be captured.\n\nThe eyes of celestial beasts include those of the **celestial tiger, celestial dog, celestial ox, celestial leopard, celestial fox**, and other beasts.*\n\nThe **Sage Emperor** said:\n*'Celestial beasts such as the **qílín, shīzǐ (lion), and the twelve *gāngfēng* (wind-riding) steeds** are known in the world as the hundred and six *chén* (dusts). Six-legged beasts—such as the **celestial deer, celestial sheep, celestial monkey**, and others—number three hundred and sixty, too many to list individually. All these beasts have secret talismanic eyes and blade-seals (*juédāo zhī*), recorded in the *Seventh Scroll of the Flowing Pearl* under the name *Zhǎngjué* (Palm Seals). These seals and blade-seals can bind and sever all beasts, preventing them from inflicting illness upon humans.\n\nIf demonic *qi* lingers within a person’s body, first administer the **Swallowing Demon-Illness Talisman** for twenty-one, twenty-eight, or thirty-five days, wearing the talisman and summons. There is no case where this fails to permanently cure and sever the affliction. These talismans are found in the *Three Sections of Miscellaneous Talismans*.\n\nIf demonic spirits have knowledge of divine communication, they will retreat and dare not return to torment.\n\nFor those who are stubborn, wicked, and refuse to accept the Dao’s teachings, you may **tread the *Dìjì* (Earth Memorization) three times**, recite the **Reversed, Inverted, and Flying Heavenly Ropes three times**, and take **Yǔbù (Great Flood Steps) three steps with nine traces**. Upon completion, transform the three steps into twelve steps—there is an illustration of this in the earlier scrolls.\n\nThen, **adjust the clothing**: with your left hand, point to the **Heavenly Middle Magic King’s Palace**, invoking the **Golden-Copper Dragon Talisman of the Heavenly Messengers**, and with your right hand, grasp and summon it. Nine times, this talisman transforms into a **ten-thousand-*zhàng* dragon**, rushing to the **Heavenly Bureau of Demons’ Palace** to seize celestial foxes and beasts, swift as water and fire.\n\nRegarding the **Decisive Rod**, the scripture states:\n*'Celestial foxes need not be killed—merely strike them twenty times, bind them, and send them to the Eastern Sea, where the Water Official will detain them for ten, five, fifteen, or twenty years, depending on the judgment of the summoned master.*\n\nThe decree states:\n*'Bind and restrain these celestial foxes. Those who violate this prohibition will be punished accordingly. After binding, send them to the Water Official for detention of so many years.*\n\nThe **Sage Emperor** spoke to **Tiānshī**, saying:\n*'When treating the illnesses of the common people, you must always enforce prohibitions, measuring the lightness or severity of their offenses before passing judgment. Judgment should spare the ghosts and spirits, lest they suffer grievously. If they suffer grievously, they may lose their original forms—how much more so if they seek rebirth among humans, taking on human bodies!*\n\nAccording to the *Sūtra on Causes and Conditions of Birth and Death*, these ghostly spirits are already discontented in their forms, yet they further harm and torment others. When summoned by a Daoist master and found guilty, they should be condemned to death but not executed on the spot. If their poisonous *qi* remains unresolved and they are slain, they will transform into venomous snakes, taking a thousand years to escape their serpentine form, only to be reborn as poultry or dogs among humans—having never attained a human life.\n\nYou must refrain from binding and restraining others in this manner. Over time, as the months and years pass, they will naturally regret their actions, confess their guilt, and seek release. In dreams, they may warn and guide others to find them, allowing them to depart for another world. After fulfilling their term as ghosts, they may be reborn into human life—but only as lowly, impoverished beings. How could they ever become noble?\n\nYou must remember my words and **never recklessly issue talismans or summonses**.\n\nHe also said:\n*'Talismans are merely the假威力 (*jiǎ wēilì*—false authority) of the Dao, used to pacify and sever demonic spirits so they do not harm people and things. Summonses are curses—using the Dao’s authority to admonish and scold spirits, preventing them from causing mischief. You must practice this well. If done correctly, it brings merit; if done recklessly, it brings guilt.*\n\n**Laozi addressed the Thirty-Three Heavenly Imperial Lords** in the *Sūtra on Guiding Beings Across*:\n\n*'There are thirty-two heavens—why does this differ from other scriptures? The four directions, each with eight heavens, make thirty-two, excluding the Central Heaven. Now, including the Central Heaven, there are thirty-three Heavenly Imperial Lords—this is the correct count.\n\nThe **Primordial Heavenly Venerable** possesses **eighty-four thousand golden talismans** and the same number of jade talismans. He is called the **Elemental Sovereign, Most Sacred Great Dao Lord**.\n\nThe **Most High Great Dao Lord** has **twelve thousand golden talismans** and the same number of jade talismans. He is called the **Master of Ten Thousand Dao**.\n\nThe **Most High Lord Lao** also has **twelve thousand golden talismans** and the same number of jade talismans. He is called the **Emperor of the Void, Great Dao, Jade Dawn**, and is known as the **Former Sage**.\n\nWhen the **Supreme Lord Lao** ascended, he was titled the **Pacified Heavenly Golden Gate Jade Dawn Later Sage, Primordial Supreme Dao Lord**. As recorded in the *Taiping Jing*, he is also called the **Jade Emperor of Heaven**.\n\nAdditionally, the *Jīnquè Yùjīng* states:\n*'The Supreme Lord Lao bears the surname **Lǐ** and given name **Ēr**, with the courtesy name **Bóyáng**.\"*",

      "translated_text": "The manifestations of divine powers upon seeing [the talismans] are fierce and boundless in the sky, yet they harm the afflicted—those whose ailments flare up and cannot be endured. **Beware, beware.**\n\nThe disciples of **Upper Clarity Three Pure** may be granted seven talismans and five methods. **Lingbao** may be granted six talismans, and **Orthodox Unity Alliance威** five. If the **Law of the Three Elements and Six Methods** is the supreme method of the world, one may, according to the **Precepts of the Most High Lord Lao**, be granted thirty-six talismans. The **Later Sage Lord’s Law** grants forty-nine talismans. These are to be bestowed according to the rank and seniority of the Daoist officials—**none may recklessly receive or practice them**, for heaven and earth forbid it.\n\nIn ancient times, **Ge Xuan**, the original master, received ten golden talismans of the **Abundant Dao**, using wooden tablets to inscribe spells and deceive the world. He also forged talismans of gold and bronze, imprinting them on paper to perform magic, killing ghosts and spirits, and bewitching people with transformations—his misdeeds were countless. The **Netherworld reported him to the Celestial Bureau**, which then petitioned the **Most High Later Sage Lord**, who condemned his great evil, demoting him two ranks and granting only the **Way of Immortality**. Because his Dao was false, it brought no benefit to mortals, and in truth, it harmed ghosts. Later scholars must be cautious and not follow his example.\n\nFor matters such as **using talismans to heal illness, protect the body, suppress malevolence, avert disaster, and dispel omens**, all methods must be properly observed.\n\nThe **Most High Lord Lao** said:\n*\"Those who practice Daoist methods are called Daoists or revered masters, yet they must abandon these titles. If they teach commoners or officials how to write talismans without proper authorization, recklessly inscribing and distributing them without purpose, they do not even mention the **shrine officials or divine offices**, nor do they know if those who wear the talismans truly believe. Such talismans are mere **precise counterfeit deceptions**—mere **shrine records without substance**. If they are but inked paper or old scraps, how could they cure disease? Such men, who falsely claim to be Daoists, are truly pitiful and lamentable.\"*\n\nThe first three or five lines are the words of the **Most High Lord Lao**; the rest are spoken by **Lu Tianxiang**.\n\n**Talismans and warrants** must specify the number of talismans issued, the destination (e.g., *\"to the household of so-and-so to heal illness\"*), and the time limit. When finished, report to the **Right Community and Soil Deity**, sending them along with the person.\n\nAfter recording the year, month, day, and hour, the warrant summons a certain official Daoist master to act.\n\n**Lu Tianxiang** said:\n*\"I received the oral precepts of the Most High Lord Lao. When giving talismans to others, one must have a **warrant of authority** and seal them properly. The warrant is what we now call the **authorization**. After issuing it, one must recite the **Sealing Ghosts Incantation** twice while stepping on the **Earth’s Veins**, and chant the following three times:*\n\n**‘Most High Lord Lao, born before Heaven and Earth.\nIlluminated by the Nine Qi, he dispels all spirits.\nThe shrine deities tremble—living without form.\nThe dead assume false names.\nThey do not appear in the Ghost Register, yet they must be executed.\nUpon receiving this warrant, reveal your true form!\nThough you are but a mountain ghost, you shall not wrongfully harm the sick.\nCease harming Daoist citizen [Name], and swiftly return their **three souls and seven spirits**.\nWear your true form, as decreed by the Most High.\nUrgent, as the Law commands.’**\n\nAfter chanting this incantation, the talisman’s efficacy is proven. If the illness is caused by a malevolent spirit, the patient shall recover upon speaking the words. Only then may one be called a **Communing-with-Spirits Daoist** and seek immortality.\"\n\n**Lu Tianxiang** further said:\n*\"I see Daoists in the world who cannot even heal their own illnesses, yet they still prescribe medicines for others—how much more absurd is it that they would dare to heal others? Such men still dare to seek the Dao of Immortality—how laughable and pitiful they are!\"*\n\n**Methods for healing illness, suppressing ghosts, and issuing warrants to banish malevolent spirits** are outlined in the *Precepts of the Most High Lord Lao’s Golden Mouth and Jade Statutes*:\n\n*\"The Precepts govern the righteous and suppress the wicked, subdue spirits, and aid humanity. The **Golden Statutes** contain **three hundred and sixty precepts**, and the **Jade Statutes** have **thirty volumes and fifteen thousand conditions**. They regulate gods, humans, dragons, and ghosts—**precise spirits, demons, and malevolent qi**—and impose punishments without leniency.\n\nThe **Jade Statutes** originally comprised fifteen thousand conditions, divided into sixty volumes. Now, from these sixty volumes, I have selected the **thirty-six essential incantations and methods**, recorded in the ninth section, to be used in **saving people, suppressing ghosts, and issuing warrants**.\n\nThe **warrants** within these conditions are used to **command celestial and earthly deities**, arrest and interrogate, and judge the guilt or innocence of spirits and humans—**to establish merit, protect the living, and suppress malevolent forces**.\n\n**First**, the method for **national defense against evil**—against wicked humans and malevolent ghosts—is to issue a **warrant to the local territorial deity**, beginning with:\n*'Consider and summon the Daoist master. Warrant to [Name] of [Mountain/Region] and [Divine Official], etc. The name of the deity must be specified.'*\n\nThe warrant states:\n*'Regarding the case of [Name], a resident of [County/Region], who has committed [Crime] at [Location], etc.'*\n\nThis follows the format of **official state documents**, but the concluding clause must read:\n*'By law, this warrant is issued to [Shrine/Deity]. It does not state \"investigation required.\"'* For the **Most High Lord Lao’s methods**, only the word **\"Law\"** is used.\n\n**Second**, the method for **suppressing ghosts afflicting the sick**—for minor spirits—is to issue a warrant to the **shrine deity and the household deity**, permanently prohibiting their interference. It reads:\n*'Consider and summon the Daoist master. Warrant to [County] Duji [Shrine].\nToday, Lu Tianxiang first adds the **City God Official**.\nReceived from the commoners or officials—specify their names.\nThe petition states:\n*\"[Name], male or female, suffers from [Illness].\nSince [Year/Month/Day], the illness has worsened, with signs of malevolent qi clinging to the body, unresolved despite all treatments.\nNow, with sincere devotion, I rely on the Great Dao to heal and suppress the ghostly bandits.\nI humbly request your judgment.\"*",

He would weave reeds into boats and ferry dozens of people across the river—no more. When people were in the water, the boats appeared as real vessels to them; yet once they reached the riverbank, the boats were merely reed leaves.\n\nDuring the reigns of Emperor Xuan and Emperor Cheng, he was highly esteemed. He was ennobled as a **Hardy Marquis** (硕侯), and the Princess of Xianyang was married to him. His title was further elevated to **Heroic** (雄) and **Efficacious** (用). For over seventy years, he enslaved the ghosts and spirits of the world without cease. The **Dao-spirits** (鬼神) grew resentful and their grievances reached the heavens. The **Supreme Sage** (太上) and the **Holy Sovereign** (后圣君) were enraged, and in retribution, they demoted him two ranks as a **Celestial Official** (仙), granting him an immortal lifespan but condemning him to serve as a **Daoist Summoner** (考召法师) for 1,500 years, recording the deeds of those who invoke him.\n\nThe wind requested permission to be listed among the **Daoist Summoners** (考召使). Thus, the wind was again granted favor, and his essence was returned to the **Central Peak** (中岳) for cultivation. His new role was to **Daoist Summoner** (考召使), tasked with performing **Daoist rites** (行法) to heal human illnesses and alleviate sudden calamities, thereby atoning for his past transgressions of taking life. In time, he would surely ascend to become a **Great Sage** (大仙).\n\nFor now, his term of punishment has not yet expired, and his lineage continues. Later disciples who attain **Daoist power** (得道力) must not recklessly employ it—be cautious, be cautious. The wind often deceives, and even those in the lineage of the **Celestial Sage Ge Xuan** (上仙葛玄) are not exempt from such errors or failures.\n\n**Third**, when the world suffers prolonged drought, crops wither, and farmers face ruin, there are indeed those who die from scorching heat. In secret, he performs **Daoist rites** (行法) to summon and bind the **Dragon Officials** (龙吏) of the **Community Altars** (社庙), dispatching them to bring rain and save the situation. This is a great virtue and merit.\n\nThe **Celestial Master Lao** (老君) said: When the world suffers prolonged drought, there are indeed those harmed by it. One may perform the rite at night when all is still: within a chamber where no one can see, tread the ground three times in **Yujian’s Pattern** (蹑地纪), then three times in **Flying Youth’s Pattern** (飞夭纲), forward, backward, and reversed. Finally, scatter the steps into **Yu’s Three-Step, Nine-Trace Pattern** (禹步三步九迹).\n\nWhen done, recite the incantation:\n*\"Supreme Sage Li Lao, in the Ninefold Celestial Realm above,\nAmidst the myriad layers of colorful clouds,\nRiding the Qilin.\nBy command, I dispatch the Great True Officials (大真王) below,\nJo, to issue the warrant.\nSummon the Dragon Officials (龙吏)—those of the Month, Day, and Hour—\nTo bring rain.\"*\n\nWhen the incantation is complete, don the ritual robes and return. With the right hand, perform the **Heavenly Seal** (天关), pointing toward the Dragon Stream Pool (龙溪潭) within the palm. After pointing, instruct the scribes to prepare the warrant. If there is a grand temple near the pool, the warrant is delivered there. If no grand temple exists, the warrant is issued and dispatched to the Dragon Stream Pool, ordering the dragons to bring rain. The dragons within the pool will respond promptly, and the rain will descend swiftly—even faster than the quenching of water and fire.\n\nIf one recognizes the incantation within the **Palm Technique** (掌诀), examine it closely and recite it as transmitted by the **Original Master** (本师) through oral instruction.\n\n**Fourth**, when the heavens bring prolonged rain without ceasing, flooding crops, this is called **Heavenly Illness** (天病), caused by the **Dragon Deities’** (神龙) licentious chaos. One performs the rite to clear the skies.\n\nThe **Celestial Master Lao** (老君) said: At night when all is still, in a secluded place where no one can observe, tread the ground three times in **Yujian’s Pattern** (蹑地纪), then three times in **Flying Youth’s Pattern** (飞夭纲), forward, backward, and reversed. When done, lower the **Pattern** (纲), scattering it into **Yu’s Three-Step, Nine-Trace Pattern** (禹步三步九迹). Don the ritual robes, and with the left hand, perform the **Heavenly Seal** (天关), pointing toward the **Ninefold Clouds and Vapor of the Ten Thousand Miles** (万里云气九度).

The **Day-Symbol Official** (符官) holds the warrant, and it is delivered to the **City Deities and Community Altars** (城隍社庙), where the deities collectively summon the Dragon Officials (龙王), the Wind Deities (风伯), and the Rain Officials (雨师), commanding them to swiftly gather the clouds and halt the rain. By the [specific hour] today, the skies shall clear—just as swiftly as water and fire parting.\"\n\n**Fifth**, when a sudden violent wind arises, snapping trees and toppling houses, yet it is not the work of the **Heavenly Dao-spirits** (天神) or **Dao-spirits** (神)—for though the Dao-spirits may create wind and rain, they do not cause harm—",

      "translated_text": "The woman asked: *\"Do you love the Dao?\"*\nShe replied: *\"Though my years are young, I love the Dao greatly. I have studied this book, which teaches the art of eternal life and immortality. Later, I shall attain the Way of the Immortal. This world rarely hears such teachings. Common folk know nothing of this Dao-scripture, and the world would otherwise have none. Thus, in my youth, I cherished its words, reading them three or five times before committing them to memory.\"*\n\nThe female immortal said: *\"I am the Immortal Alwang Xiao. I teach you to read this book. From now on, whenever you have leisure, come here. I will guide you further and teach you the methods of its practice.\"*\n\nThus, from that day forward, whenever she had free time, she would secretly go alone at noon. After two years, her maternal grandmother noticed her absence and secretly followed her to the forest, where she saw her reading with a woman. Delighted, she said nothing to others, but listened in silence for three years, until her Daoic studies were complete.\n\nWhen her mastery was achieved, she could command ghosts and spirits like servants, bending them to her will as easily as turning her hand. She could communicate with spirits, summon and bind tigers and leopards—nothing was beyond her power.\n\nDuring the reign of Emperor Wen of Wei, there was a great drought lasting over seventy days, with the sun blazing red and no clouds in sight. The emperor sought rain through every means but found no answer. The county officials recommended Lady Fan’s granddaughter, who had mastered Daoic arts, could summon tigers and leopards, and command ghosts and spirits to petition for rain.\n\nThe emperor ordered his concubine, Lady Zhao Dan, to write a request on silk, commanding her to seek rain. At the time, Lady Fan was indoors, ashamed and reluctant to comply. Lady Zhao reasoned with her: *\"You are of the Wang clan by birth. Why conceal your lineage? Given the current drought, saving lives brings merit. If the people are at peace, how can you withhold such virtue?\"*\n\nLady Fan then composed a letter to the Dragon King, which was sent into a deep pool. Rain fell immediately.\n\nAt fifteen, she married into the Liu family and traveled with her husband as an official across the empire. Later, her husband, Liu Gang, learned of her abilities and, with proper rites, requested her teachings. He received ten volumes of the scripture and was given diagrams of the Three Elements and Six Canons, along with the Seven Stars.\n\nOver fifty years later, the couple both ascended as immortals. In the Eastern Mountains of Kuaiji, his wife sat upon a cloud-driven dragon chariot and departed. Her husband ascended a *zhaojia* tree and followed her. The Daoist records then conferred upon her the title of *Xian Guan*, a mid-ranking true immortal.\n\n**The Supreme Lord Laozi’s Golden-Mouthed Edict: *The Female Qing-Shao Scripture for Protecting Households and Families (Zheng Ritual)***\n*\"Heaven is my resolute heart. My disciples and those who follow my teachings must act with sincerity and justice, rescuing beings from sickness and calamity.\"*\n\n**Calamities** are of ten kinds:\n1. Heavenly epidemic plagues—those who practice this teaching with sincerity shall not be blamed by Heaven.\n2. Seasonal prohibitions—no harm shall come from them.\n3. Official misdeeds—none shall be unjust.\n4. Fire, 5. Water, 6. War.\n7. Ghostly possession and malevolent spirits, 8. Poverty and hardship, 9. Deafness and blindness, 10. Internal ghosts.\n\nFor my summoned disciples, each year on the first day of the first month, before dawn when people are still asleep, they must issue talismans to protect their households, ensuring safety and freedom from disease and plague.\n\nThe **Supreme Lord Laozi’s Golden-Mouthed Edict** states:\n*\"The six Canons of the sixty days must be inscribed, listing the names of malevolent ghosts, along with the Female Qing Ritual, all contained within the Ghostly Statutes. Three copies must be placed at the head of the talisman: one at the community shrine, one at the ancestral hall, and one above the household door. After one year, the household shall forever be free from calamity, plague, and illness, and disputes shall naturally dissolve.*\n\n*\"Additionally, one must recite the *Diezhi Ji* and the *Feitian Gang* three times each, stepping in the Nine-Step Yujubu formation. The incantation is as follows:*\n\n*'Sue poison, sue poison,\nSue disease, sue evil,\nSue ghosts, sue serpents,\nSue speech, sue tongue,\nSue rats, sue mice,\nSue waste, sue water,\nSue metal, sue fire,\nSue earth, sue wood,\nSue deceit, O Lord of Men!*\n\n*One hundred twenty sues—sue swiftly, sue and disperse!*\n*Swiftly, as the decree commands!*\n\n*When reciting this incantation loudly, hold the written talisman in the left hand and pinch the *Dujian* talisman in the right, uttering each ‘sue’ while making a downward gesture with the hand—this brings great fortune.\"*\n\nThe Highest True Immortals perform this ritual annually without fail.\n\nLaozi said: *\"The path of Dao has gates, and the pursuit of Truth has roads. To obtain the gate is to attain *tong*—communion with spirits. When one studies the Dao and attains the gate, they possess *wei*—power to command ghosts, spirits, and the heavens, making them respond. This is called *shentong*—spiritual penetration. To obtain the road is to become an immortal. Immortals are the rank of True Persons. Those who practice the True Person’s Way and master this thirty-plus volume scripture, penetrating the Golden Talismans, later become known as the *Golden Lock Flowing Pearl Scripture*, harmonizing the Three Elements, emerging from the Upper Clarity, encompassing the Orthodox Unity—this is the path and the road to communion, enabling one to ride dragons and traverse the void, named the *Path of Daoic Cultivation to Communion*. Later, one may ride dragons and walk upon the clouds, wandering freely in the Purple Palace, near the rank of the Immortal Officials.*\n\n*If practiced for nine years, a household shall have no sickness. If practiced for twenty years, the entire family shall attain Daoic power. This method is akin to the *Bazhe* (House-Transference) technique.*\n\n**Note:** This ritual must be performed in the last days of the twelfth month (the 26th or 27th), inscribing the talismans and edicts of the Ghostly Statutes, with the master’s seal. At the stroke of three in the morning on the first day of the first month, the incantation must be recited. Modern practitioners no longer recite the words on the talisman—only the incantation is heard.\n\n**A Comprehensive Ritual for Protecting Officials’ Households and Families from Calamity**\nThis is also included in the *New Chapter Rites*.",

      "translated_text": "Laozi said to Master Xu: *\"Xu Le, you are a master who protects and delivers from calamity. Now you are Zhang Ti, known as the Three Heavenly Orthodoxy Master. Now you are also Xiao Zhang, succeeding Da Zhang as the Celestial Master. You teach disciples to become national masters, to protect the inner palaces of the state and to pacify the distant prefectures and counties of the people.\n\nFirst, present the Six Divine Writings of Heaven. Later, the Sage changed the titles and texts, making them into the Chapter Writings. The Most High approved them, granting talismans and edicts to the Five Sacred Mountains and Four Great Waters, to the cities and ancestral shrines. There are thirty-six volumes of grand proclamations and talismans. Twenty-four volumes are for pacifying the inner palaces, five volumes for the Five Sacred Mountains—the Sage later named them the Five Mountains, corresponding to the five phases: Wood, Fire, Earth, Water, and Metal. The remaining seven volumes: six are to be placed in sacred mountain caves, and one in the Water Palace. All these are rituals to be recited in a low, quiet voice, without musical resonance.\n\nThese are all Yang methods, human ordinances. The term *academy* (社) was once called *assembly* (斋), now changed to *gathering* (齐会). *Gathering* means to discuss and study scriptures. This is for beginners who have not yet entered the Dao. Do not let your disciples practice such methods—these are not the true, superior Chapter Rituals. The Chapter Writings originate from separate scriptures, containing five texts. The Sage-Emperor bestowed twelve talismans to pacify the nation, protect against calamity, and deliver from misfortune. Each has its own texts and rituals, detailed in the lower sections—examine and use them accordingly.\n\nLaozi said: For the ruler of a kingdom—today’s prefects and magistrates—officials, and governors: do not use proclamations. Issue three edicts and thirty-six talismans. Twelve talismans pacify the Twelve Celestial Deities, twelve talismans guard the gates, and twelve talismans are placed within the household, to be worn by the head of the family and the eldest son. Commoners may practice this freely, but do not inscribe the thirty-six talismans. Three Chapter Writings are for officials, while commoners may use two or one.\n\nWhen performing the talisman rituals, first step on the *Earth Measure*, then ascend the *Heavenly Rope*, each three times. Scatter the Nine Steps as the *Yugong Steps*, adjust the robes, and with nine fingers, dispel calamity and malevolent *qi* from houses and cities. Then, according to the talismans, place the edicts and talismans in their proper positions. For one or two years, there shall be no disasters.\n\nTo remove misfortune, pacify calamity, and protect households—use the same methods as before. Laozi’s statutes decree: Commoners use twenty-four talismans, two Chapter Writings, and practice according to the master’s intent. The secret is to pinch the first joint of the fourth finger on the left hand urgently.\n\nWhen summoning a master or disciple-master, and summoning scribes and officials: If traveling with family or oneself to another prefecture, first issue an edict to the ancestral temples and city gods. These gods existed in the Jin Dynasty. The ritual of escorting, welcoming, and bidding farewell for protection is as follows:\n\nLaozi commands the spirits of the shrines: When summoning, the master’s name must be written. For travelers with family, issue an edict five days in advance to the Nine Regions’ community leaders—Wu Zixu is one. If not summoning a proper master, issue an edict with the name written above and the scribe’s name below. If summoning a master from the Nine Regions, use a proper edict without talismans—talismans are on the edict’s head, not the seal. Laozi’s command states: Before the talisman is connected to the edict, the recording official—whether high or low—must be recorded. Today, people call Daoists *Celestial Officials*. For low-ranking officials, the edict states: ‘Regarding the aforementioned matter.’ Follow the official’s written edict, changing only the word *law* (法).\n\nFor secret edicts, follow the ritual: ‘Must issue an edict to the shrine, as follows.’ In official edicts, it states: ‘Must check the matter, as follows.’ Daoist edicts state: ‘Must issue an edict to the shrine gods and such-and-such deities, for escorting, welcoming, and bidding farewell, to protect within the boundaries. Safely convey the traveler by land or water, without any untoward incidents.’\n\nThe secret method is the same as before: pinch the first joint of the left hand.\n\n**The Talisman of Punishment and the Destruction of Shrines**\n*Punishment* refers to interrogating the talisman scribes and officials for delays or violations. If they do not comply urgently, hesitate, or fail to respond, it is called *Punishment Talisman*. *Destruction of Shrines* also interrogates the shrine and deity officials for failing to respond to talismans and edicts according to ritual. Thus, they must be punished with rods or demoted—there are other replacements—this is called *Destruction of Shrines*.\n\nLu Tianxuan transmitted the Golden-Mouthed Laozi’s ordinances: If one talisman is not honored, the blame falls on the direct scribe. *Rescript* refers to today’s Chapter Writings.\"",

      "translated_text": "「The Three Assemblies’ *Ritual of the Daoist Assembly* (三会日醮) and *Sacrificial Offerings for the Blind* (祭盲功) to Bestow Merit and Promote Officials and Soldiers (迁赏吏兵法)\n\nFor the *Ritual of the Assembly* (社庙), do not bestow merit with wine. Instead, have them sit outside the altar (坛).\n\nThe *Venerable Master Lao* (老君) said: Those who receive the *Law* (法) must follow the prescribed rituals (科仪) for the *Assembly Offerings* (醮祭), then auspiciousness (吉) shall follow; otherwise, misfortune (凶) will ensue. Those with *Lofty Aspirations* (上志之人) understand this *Way* (道).\n\nThe ritual states: On the *Upper Assembly Day* (上会) of the *Upper Month* (上元月), the *Assembly Offering* (醮) is made to *Heavenly Officials, Lord of the Upper Month* (天官君上元唐将军), and *Tang General of the Upper Assembly* (上元上部唐将军), whose surname is *Tang* and given name is *Short* (名短).\n\nOn the *Middle Assembly Day* (中会) of the *Middle Month* (中元月), the *Middle Assembly General* (中元中部葛将军) and others, including *Li General of the Middle Assembly* (上元中部李将军), serve as the *Assembly Offering* (醮) leaders. *Li General* commands the *Earthly Officials* (地官), while *Ge General* (葛将军) oversees the *Three Spirits of the Human Form* (人身三魂) and *Seven Souls* (七魄), the *Three Generals within the Body* (身中三将军), the *One Hundred Fifty Generals* (百五十将军), and the *Spiritual and Divine Officers and Soldiers* (仙灵将吏). Those who receive *Talismans and Ordinations* (符箓) as the *Divine Seat* (仙座) for the *Middle Month* (中元) are led by *Li* and *Ge Generals*, who command the *Heavenly Officials* (天官) and *Water Officials* (水官) and others. On this day, the *Three Months’ Generals and Soldiers* (三元将军吏兵), the *Functional Officials* (功曹司吏), the *Six Celestial Stems’ Generals and Soldiers* (六甲君官将军兵吏), the *Jade Boys and Jade Girls* (玉童玉女), and the *Direct Palace and Attendant Officials and Talisman Scribes* (直宫从官符吏) all gather to sit and receive the *Assembly Offering* (醮).\n\nThis day is the seventh day of the first month (正月七日). The *Upper Assembly* (上会) summons the *Nine Celestial Officials* (九天之官), the *Middle Assembly* (中会) invites the *Nine Earthly Officials* (九地之官), and the *Lower Assembly* (下会) calls upon the *Generals and Soldiers of the Human Form’s Talismans and Ordinations* (人身中法箓将军吏兵) and the *Water Officials’ Generals and Soldiers* (水官将军吏兵).\n\nThe *Later Sage-Emperor* (后圣君) instructed the *Heavenly Master* (天师): On the *Three Assemblies’ Days* (三会之日), the *Generals and Soldiers of the Three Officials* (天地水三官中大神君将军吏兵) all gather on this day for the *Assembly Offering* (社会), seeking to partake in the *Assembly Sacrifice* (求饮醮). This day’s *Assembly Offering* (醮) can expiate sins, bring blessings, and nurture fortune for all beings (福佑人物). It can also cultivate and nourish slaves, servants, cattle, and horses (育养奴婢牛马之类). Disasters and calamities will be averted (祸灭灾消), and joy and celebration will fill the household (身家喜庆). Why? Because on these three days, the *Three Officials* (三官) and the *Three Divine Generals* (三神) of Heaven, Earth, and Water all convene together (俱会於此日).\n\nThe *Most High Emperor* (上帝) graciously relents, and on these days, one need not attend the morning court assemblies (不朝集). Thus, blessings are obtained (所以获福).\n\nMoreover, the *Assembly Offering* (醮) must be performed on the night of the *proper day* (正日). After the *people’s rest* (人定), during the *first watch* (一更时), or the *second watch* (二更时), the greatest blessings and protections (大福佑) can be secured. This is when all the gods gather (此时众神俱会之时). If the ritual extends beyond the *third watch* (三更) until the *fifth watch* (五更), it is absolutely unsuited for the *Assembly Offering* (切不堪醮). Why? Because the *Divine and Heavenly Officials* (神官仙官) and *Generals and Soldiers* (将军吏兵), all belonging to the *yin* (阴), appear as if seen by humans during the night. They attend the early morning court assemblies (日日早朝会家) and ordinary guests (闲客) may come. Important guests (要客) are summoned for official matters (皆有公事), and they only arrive after the court session concludes (直至衙退). The *Divine Officials* (神官), *Heavenly Officials* (仙官), and *Generals and Soldiers* (将军吏兵) from the *third watch* (三更) onward until the *fifth watch* (五更) are all eager to attend the morning court sessions (上朝天曹). Their minds are preoccupied with the affairs before them (心攻前排整), and they are busy with their attendants and carriages (车御忙). If their thoughts are scattered or distracted (心乱思), they will not come to receive the rites (不来受礼), or if they do come, they will stay only briefly (来亦不久), appearing and disappearing in haste (忽忽不多周匝). Thus, no blessings are gained, and misfortune is instead invited (所以不获福，却招恶).\n\nFor those who aspire to the *Way* (志人学道), they must first recognize this as a profound truth (先须知此为妙) and be cautious not to reveal it rashly to unworthy individuals (慎勿妄示非人). If unworthy individuals (非人) speak of erroneous doctrines (妄说异端), they will incur the *Heavenly Judgment* (天考).\n\nThe ritual further states: On the *Middle Assembly Day* (中会) of the *Middle Month* (中元月), the *Middle Assembly Offering* (醮) is led by *Earthly Officials, Lord of the Middle Month* (地官君上元中部李将军) and *Ge General of the Middle Assembly* (中元中部葛将军), among others.\n\nThe *Later Sage-Emperor* (后圣君) instructed the *Heavenly Master* (天师): Between Heaven and Earth (天地之间), following the *Two Principles* (二仪), there are the *Three Months* (三元), with the *Middle Month* (中元) being the joint master of Earth and humanity (地人两主). *Li General* commands the *Earthly Officials* (地官), while *Ge General* oversees the *Three Spirits of the Human Form* (人身三魂), *Seven Souls* (七魄), the *Three Generals within the Body* (身中三将军), the *One Hundred Fifty Generals* (百五十将军), and the *Divine and Spiritual Officers and Soldiers* (仙灵将吏). Those who receive *Talismans and Ordinations* (符箓) for the *Middle Month* (中元) are seated as the *Divine Seat* (仙座) to govern the *qi of the Middle Month* (中元之气), all under the command of *Li* and *Ge Generals*. They lead the *Heavenly Officials* (天官) and *Water Officials* (水官) and others. The *Three Months* (三元) are fully represented, and the *Generals, Officers, and Soldiers* (官将史兵) assemble.\n\nFirst, the *Generals and Soldiers of the Upper and Lower Months* (上元及下元君官将军), the *Functional Officials and Soldiers* (兵士功曹司吏), the *Generals and Soldiers of the Six Celestial Stems* (六甲君官将军兵吏), the *Jade Boys and Jade Girls* (玉童玉女), and the *Direct Palace and Attendant Officials and Talisman Scribes* (直宫从官符吏) take their seats. Only then do the *Two Generals of the Lower Month* (下元徐周二将军二人), *Xu General of the Upper Water Assembly* (上元下部徐将军) and *Zhou General of the Middle Water Assembly* (中元下部周将军), along with their soldiers (及兵士), sit.\n\nThe *Master* (师主) must focus their mind and command the *Seat of the Assembly* (指撝座位). Only after this is settled (定后) should the ritual begin (方始启请). Each must be clearly provided with food and drink (分明一一饮食在). The *Master* (师主) must arrange and oversee the offerings (指摄安置), particularly the wine (上酒处分), and ensure the proper number of libations (般数取足).\n\nHave someone prepare additional *secret gruel* (密浆之属) and other offerings, ensuring the *True Person of Will* (保真) sees *Venerable Master Li* (李尊师). They must add tea, offering three or four cups per seat (每座三四盏). The *True Person of Will* (保真) must then request *Ding* (丁) to conduct the *Assembly Offering* (醮) and transmit the *Law* (传法), bowing in reverence to their original teacher (伏依本师) and daring not to neglect or disobey (不敢违阙). They must ask that the teachings be passed down through generations (请后人相传继代), ensuring the *Way* of their original teacher is never lost (莫绝本师之教).\n\nThe ritual further states: On the *Lower Assembly Day* (下会) of the *Lower Month* (下元月), the *Water Officials, Lords of the Lower Assembly* (水官君上元下部徐将军) and *Zhou General of the Middle Water Assembly* (中元下部周将军), among others, lead the *Assembly Offering* (醮).\n\nThe *Later Sage-Emperor* (后圣君) instructed *Zhang the Heavenly Master* (张天师): On the *Upper Assembly Day* (上会), the seventh day of the first month (正月七日), the *Heavenly True Ones* (天真) descend to observe (下观). If one sets up the *Assembly Offering* (设醮) on this day, the *Heavenly Officials* (天官君), *Generals and Soldiers* (兵将), and *Earthly and Water Officials* (地水官) must wholeheartedly approach with sincerity and reverence (尽心须以虔恳), avoiding any impurity or vulgarity (勿秽浊), and receive boundless blessings (受福无量).\n\nOn the *Middle Assembly Day* (中会), the *Earthly True Ones* (地真) come to supervise the *Assembly Offering* (来监醮). The *Earthly Officials* (地官君), *Generals and Soldiers* (兵将), and *Heavenly and Water Officials* (天官水官君) must be invited. On the *Lower Assembly Day* (下会), the *Water True Ones* (水真) descend to supervise (来监醮). The *Water Officials* (水官君), *Generals and Soldiers* (兵将), and *Heavenly and Earthly Officials* (天地官君) must all be invited.\n\nThe *Middle Assembly Day* (中会) is the seventh day of the seventh month (七月七日). The *Lower Assembly Day* (下会) is the fifth day of the tenth month (十月五日). These three days are the *Three Assembly Days* (并是三会之日).\n\nFirst, the *Generals and Soldiers of the Upper and Middle Months* (先领上元及中元君官将军), the *Functional Officials and Soldiers* (兵士功曹可吏等), take their seats. Only then do the *Two Generals of the Lower Month* (下元徐周二将军二人), *Xu* and *Zhou Generals* (徐周), along with their soldiers (及兵士), sit.\n\nThe *Master* (师主) must focus their mind and command the *Seat of the Assembly* (心分主领指撝座位). This is for those who receive the *Talismans and Ordinations of the Three Months* (受三元箓人) to conduct the *Assembly Offering* (自醮), as well as for those who invite disciples and fellow students (及入诸弟子等共醮). Thus, it is called the *Master* (师主).\n\nThe *Later Sage-Emperor* (后圣君) instructed the *Heavenly Master* (天师): You are the *Master of the Three Months’ Talismans and Ordinations* (三元法箓吏兵师主), so in ancient times, you were designated as the *Master* (师主) for disciples and fellow students (有弟子及同学人兵). When conducting the *Assembly Offering* (设醮), each must follow the prescribed words (各依辞). If the words are recited by oneself (如若自辞), then the prescribed words need not be used (即不用辞). After finishing the words (读词毕), one must recite the *Record of Merit and Deeds* (功状一遍).\n\nThe *Record* (状) speaks of merit and deeds (言功), the promotion and bestowal of officials and soldiers (迁赏吏兵). If there is indeed merit (如实有功), then it must be spoken of. If there is no merit (如无功), then the mention of merit must be omitted (即不用言功).」",

Those already selected in the *Kǎozhào Yí* (考召仪) and recorded in the memorials are not listed here. The promotions and appointments follow their own prescribed rituals.\n\n　　For regions and prefectures plagued by disasters—such as floods, fires, illnesses, and calamities—where people suffer unrest, the appropriate *fú* (符) and *zhāo* (章) are drafted to invoke *zhèn* (镇) and *yàn* (厌) rites.\n\n　　The *Lǎojūn* (老君) instructed the Daoist master Luo (罗法师): \"In the world, there are prefectures and regions afflicted by numerous disasters, where people and spirits are unsettled. You may now act to pacify them. Specifically, on the four *Mèng* (孟) days—*yín* (寅), *shēn* (申), *wèi* (巳), and *hài* (亥)—you shall tread the *Dìjì* (地纪) and invoke the *Fēitiān Gāng* (飞天纲), each three times.\n\n　　Afterward, you shall scatter the *Dàyǔ Bù* (大禹步) fifteen times, while simultaneously reciting the *Dūjiān Jué* (都监诀) with your left hand and holding the talisman with your right hand. Once the talisman is inscribed with the proper words, perform this rite and issue the talisman, commanding the practitioner to kneel and receive it before departing.\n\n　　In accordance with the later edicts of the *Shèngjūn* (圣君) and the *Tiānshī* (天师), when performing the *Bù* (步) and *Gāng* (纲) rites, you must not be seen. After completing the rites, summon the practitioner to kneel and receive the talisman. The talisman is then sent forward.\n\n　　Later, you shall compose the written record...」",

The household head, wife, and local officials must also bear one talisman each. In total, distribute twenty-eight talismans of the *Dào* (道).\n\nThe talismans are listed in the *Dìngzhái Yí* (镇宅仪). The twelve talismans of the *Shànggǔ* (上古) are used to pacify the twelve deities overseeing the dwelling, while twelve talismans are affixed to the doors and windows, including the rear door and stove. Additionally, four talismans are posted above, and the household head and wife bear them as well. Once this is done, within three years, calamities and illnesses shall cease forever.\n\nIf you perform a second round of pacification, within six years, no calamities shall arise.

deceitful,\nneither gluttonous nor lustful,\nneither jealous nor resentful,\nneither hateful nor fond,\nneither encroaching nor stealing,\nneither quarrelsome nor competitive,\nneither licentious nor

      "translated_text": "The Governor acted swiftly that very night, ordering men to capture the spirits. In the night, he saw a single sovereign emerge from the earth, accompanied by tens of thousands of soldiers, who repelled the captors. The sovereign said to them: \"I am King Ke of Wu. My tomb sinks two *zhang* (丈) into the earth—why do you persist in building a city over it? Each night, I cause the walls to collapse and the earth to be carried away by *yin-forces* (阴兵). By dawn, no trace remains, and this has occurred seven or eight times.\"\n\nThe Governor thus retained the tomb, moved the city walls to curve around it, and established a temple a hundred *bu* (步) away. Henceforth, there were city gods and spirit officials. Today, wherever there are graves in the *dìfǔ* (地府, Underworld), if they confer with the Underworld authorities, the Most High Celestial Emperor grants permission for the deceased to become the chief among the city gods and spirit officials of that locality. The talismans and decrees are issued with divine authority, and their efficacy in driving and subduing malevolent spirits is unparalleled, reaching even to the farthest corners.\n\nWhen entering a certain state, county, or village, and a particular person’s household, to seize and capture the restless spirits, curses, and thieving ghosts—such is the practice. The decrees follow the prescribed rituals as outlined above.\n\nThe Most High Lao Dao/Way’s method to sever curses includes five talismans. Two of these are contained within this incantation, which demonstrates their efficacy. The remaining three are found in the *Sanbu* (三部) miscellaneous talismans—primarily within the *Zhèngyī* (正一, Orthodox Unity) *Sanbu*, not the *Língbǎo* (灵宝, Numinal Treasure) *Sanbu*. In the world, there exist the *Língbǎo* *Sanbu* miscellaneous talismans, the *Tàixuān* (太玄, Supreme Mysterious) *Sanbu* miscellaneous talismans, the *Liùjiǎ* (六甲) *Sanbu* miscellaneous talismans, the *Liùrén* (六壬) *Sanbu* miscellaneous talismans, and the *Liùdīng* (六丁) *Sanbu* miscellaneous talismans, among others. All these are compiled by the Most High Lao Dao/Way, totaling seventy-two volumes, and are also included in the *Lǎojūn Zhèngzhuàn* (老君正传, Lao Dao/Way’s True Transmission).\n\nThe two talismans of divine efficacy are detailed in this text. The remaining three are noted in the previous section. All talismans within these volumes are inscribed in red.\n\nThe following talisman treats those afflicted by curses and suffering from extreme exhaustion and emaciation. When swallowed, it alleviates their condition. One should ingest it daily.\n\nThe following talisman slays curses, restless spirits, and pests. Prepare it by writing on a clean, white tablet, mixing with water in a pure basin, and placing it before the afflicted person. For each individual, present the talisman and cast it into the water. After seven days, if the talisman sinks, the curses, restless spirits, and pests will all perish, and the person’s illness will be cured. This efficacy is genuine; do not recklessly transmit it to others.\n\nThe decrees and talismans are also hung on doors and gateways. The talismans are inscribed according to the rituals outlined above, and their efficacy is derived from the prescribed rites.\n\nLater, the Sage Emperor instructed the Heavenly Master (天师): \"If you wish to cure the plague for all people, you may tread the *dìjì* (地纪, Earthly Boundary) three times, scatter the *Yǔbù* (禹步, Steps of Yu) nine times, and don ritual attire, wearing the *dòu* (斗, Dipper) as your garment, so that your form resembles the Northern Dipper—this is the true Dipper Sovereign. Turn toward the *Tiān Guān* (天关, Heavenly Pass) and point in the direction of the afflicted person’s dwelling. Then recite the *Bāguà* (八卦, Eight Trigrams) incantation once.\n\nThe *Bāguà* incantation reads:\n*Qián zūn yào líng* (乾尊耀灵, The Heavenly Trigram is revered, its brilliance is sacred),\n*Kūn shùn nèi róng* (坤顺内荣, The Earthly Trigram is compliant, its inner grace flourishes),\nand so on.\n\nThen, seated, write the five talismans to sever curses and give them to the afflicted person to swallow or wear as an amulet, specifying the number of days by which their illness will be cured. When the days are up, the illness will indeed be cured—this method is highly efficacious.\n\n**The Method to Sever Plagues for Officials and Commoners**\nLao Dao/Way said: \"The plague’s *qi* (毒之气) harms all beings. When one person contracts the *qi*, it can kill ten others. When ten people are infected by its *qi*, they can spread and kill up to a hundred. Thus, there are many deaths. When one dies, ten others grieve for them. In the world, this is called the *wúyì bìng* (无义病, Plague of Injustice)—it does not discriminate between noble and ignoble, good and evil. Those who contract it rarely survive.\n\nSince one person’s death leads to ten others grieving, and from ancient times to today, such cases are often seen, I often fear that those who practice the Dao may be afflicted, causing others to grieve. Therefore, I have issued this chapter to prevent disasters and malevolent spirits.\n\nI possess nineteen talismans, and among those that can cure this plague, they are efficacious. If one has contracted the illness, swallowing this talisman will bring about a great cure in three days, and a minor cure on the very same day.\n\nThis talisman is the Most High Lao Dao/Way’s personal transmission to the Yellow Emperor, who practiced it and preserved it. It has been passed down through generations to this day. This is its original text, and it is highly efficacious.\n\nThe two talismans of divine efficacy are inscribed in this volume. The first talisman, when worn by the unill, and kept near the afflicted person during sitting or sleeping, prevents the illness from spreading. The first talisman, when swallowed by the afflicted person, causes sweat to break out and brings about a minor cure that very day, and a great cure within three days.\n\nThe following talisman is for the afflicted person to swallow. The following talisman is for the unill to wear, sharing sleeping and sitting spaces without risk of contagion.\n\n**Lao Dao/Way’s Great Talisman**\nIts length is one *chǐ* (尺) eight *cùn* (寸). At its base is a decree that reads:\n*\"Lǎojūn shénfú* (老君神符, Lao Dao/Way’s Divine Talisman),\ncontrols the five *guǐwáng* (鬼王, Ghost Kings) of the *Wǔbù* (五部, Five Departments)—*Liú Yuándá* (刘元达), *Zhāng Yuànbó* (张元伯), *Zhào Gōngmíng* (赵公明), *Shǐ Wényè* (史文业), and *Zhōng Shìjì* (钟仕季)—\nalong with the *Wǔgǒu* (五蛊, Five Pestilential Spirits), the *Bǎidú* (百毒, Hundred Poisons), and the *Huángnú Bósāng* (黄奴伯桑, Yellow Slave Bossang),\nas well as the vulgar *Liùdīng* (六丁) ghosts.\nThose who obtain it will be decapitated at the waist,\nwithout regard for past transgressions.\n*Jíjí rúlìng* (急急如律令, Swiftly, as the decree commands).\nThis decree is also inscribed beneath the Great Talisman,\nand hung on the main gate.\"",

      "translated_text": "**Lao Dao/Way’s Method for Severing Pestilence**\n\nThis talisman lies within the *Three Departments* (三部) of miscellaneous talismans, so its full text is not recorded here. Among the *Three Departments* of miscellaneous talismans is a separate chapter for severing and prohibiting plagues (断禁瘟), and the talisman’s text must be carefully sought.\n\nLater sage-rulers possess a grand chapter for severing plagues (断瘟大章), which, when appended above this chapter, will cause all cases of *kǒu wēn* (口瘟, oral plague) to vanish immediately. Before using this chapter, one must observe a period of abstinence from meat and strong flavors for three-five days (三五日), or three-seven days (三七日), or four-seven days (四七日), five-seven days (五七日), six-seven days (六七日), or seven-seven days (七七日) for a great expulsion. If one strictly observes abstinence for a hundred days beforehand, the efficacy will be even more potent.\n\nThis chapter is found in the upper register of *Jīnsuǒ Liúzhū* (《金锁流珠》), not fully included in this book. The chapter itself is in the first volume of *Jīnsuǒ Liúzhū*, comprising ten sheets of paper, already inscribed and not recorded here. To invoke this chapter, follow the established method.\n\nLao Dao/Way speaks: *\"To sever pestilence, one must first obtain the name of the afflicted person, along with their residence—state, county, village, or neighborhood (郭言坊). The year, month, and day when they contracted the plague, and the severity of their illness: whether they were infected by a pestilential *guǐwáng* (鬼王, Ghost King) or *qi* (气), or whether they died or remain gravely ill. If they died, state ‘dead’ (死); if they did not, state ‘grave’ (重). After a certain span of months and days, another person is afflicted, and one fears a continuous chain of infections. I humbly beg the Great Dao/Way for compassion and request an order of prohibition for each case. I await the judgment of the Dao/Way and the officials (判). Now, another person is infected in succession. All details must be written as in the official report, with the Dao/Way’s officials issuing their judgment.*\n\n*Once completed, inscribe the talisman in vermilion (朱书符) within a purified chamber (净室), reciting three times while tracing the ground (蹑地纪), and three times while invoking the *Fēitiān Gāng* (飞天纲, Heavenly Skybound Decree). Afterward, perform the *Yǔbù* (禹步, Steps of Yu) three times—three steps, nine traces (三步九迹)—left and right, then once more, totaling two sets of steps. Then recite the incantation:*\n\n*'I rely upon the Three-Five (三五) and the Arcane Below (魁魁之下), where ten thousand ghosts and myriad spirits are all my servants to summon. All malicious and malevolent *jīngxié* (精邪, malevolent essences) and ghosts beneath the heavens submit to death beneath the Heavenly Skybound Decree, motionless and inert. The wicked hide in vain, officials dissolve them, slanderers are silenced, and the afflicted swiftly recover. Chì-chì-chì! Swiftly, as the decree commands (急急如律令).'*\n\n*Once the incantation is finished, write the talisman. When the talisman is complete, pinch the pestilential ghost’s eye (捻瘟鬼目)—the eye is on the fourth finger of the left hand, at the third joint, where the scar of a blade is marked. Pinching it causes the ghost to die; this method is highly efficacious and auspicious (吉). Send it far to permanently sever the pestilence. If the ghost refuses to sever, invoke the *Dàchì Zhāng* (大赤章, Great Vermilion Chapter) to decapitate it, ensuring the ghost’s death and the person’s survival—this is also highly efficacious.*\n\n*This plague must never be treated by monks’ incantations or magical rites (咒术加持); otherwise, the ghosts will not submit and may even retaliate with harm. In ancient times, the Wu King (吴王) Sun Quan (孙权) suffered this affliction in his inner palace. A monk named Fa Chao (法超) arrived from the Western lands, renowned for his incantations, and when he invoked them, he was slain by the ghosts. The fifth monk died, and among the hundreds afflicted in the palace, all perished as well. Therefore, all manner of talismans and decrees must be dispatched to distant states to capture and subdue the malevolent ghosts and spirits.*\n\nLao Dao/Way instructs the Yellow Emperor (黄帝): *\"If you wish to summon ghosts (追鬼), inscribe their names on the talisman. The *Tàishàng* (太上, Supreme Sage) refers to the current decree (牒帖). In ancient times, this was called the *Tiānfú* (天符, Heavenly Talisman), invoked by both humans and ghosts. Now, humans recognize it as the Great Dao/Way’s talisman, while ghosts still call it the Heavenly Talisman as before.*\n\n*To execute this talisman, each method and incantation must be followed precisely, as the techniques for summoning, interrogating, capturing, and expelling ghosts differ. Summoning is swiftest through water and fire. The Emperor inquires: ‘How does one know the ghost’s name?’ Lao Dao/Way replies: ‘Simply have the afflicted write their statement (作辞) saying: “My illness has persisted for so many days without improvement, and all medical treatments have failed. A malevolent ghost or spirit has afflicted me; I beg for the Great King’s pursuit and interrogation.” The Yellow Emperor then declares: ‘Order the Daoist to conceal and the officials to judge, and so forth.’*\n\n*Across the Nine Regions (九州), the land spirits and local deities (灵祇) have evolved. In ancient times, there were only *Tiānshén Dìzhǐ* (天神地祇, Heavenly Gods and Earthly Spirits), with no shrines or temples. In the middle ages, there were *zuǒshè yòujì* (左社右稷, Left Communal Altars and Right Grain Offerings), but still no formal shrines or temples. From the Han, Wei, Jin, and Song dynasties onward, there were established *shèjì shén guān* (社稷神官, Communal and Grain Offering Deities). Later, during the Qi, Liang, Chen, and Sui dynasties, the *chénghuáng shén guān* (城隍神官, City Gods and Wall Deities) emerged. By the decree of later sage-rulers, the Daoist officials (法师) oversee the summoning and judgment, and these talismans are called *Miaozhí Fú* (庙直符, Temple Rectification Talismans). The City Gods and Wall Deities assist in summoning and interrogating, passing the talismans through their respective domains as officials pass decrees through counties and states, to sever deceit and capture malevolent spirits. This is the Dao/Way’s supreme method for nurturing humanity and binding ghosts, driving dragons and commanding spirits. It originates from the Celestial Palace (上天宫阙) and is transmitted through the ages to those with lofty aspirations (有道之志人).*\n\n*Once summoned, the ghost’s name is revealed, and the Daoist issues the decree, ordering the illness to subside within a certain number of days. The ghosts are then prohibited from entering the *Dìyù* (地狱, Underworld Prison), which, in ancient times, was drawn on the earth as a prison (画地为狱). Three concentric lines formed the prison, confining guilty ghosts within. After ten or five days, they would submit to their punishment. Once the term is fulfilled, their sentence is carried out: the severely guilty are executed, and they do not escape, while those not deserving death remain confined. Thus, it is called the Underworld Prison (地狱). Later generations, misunderstanding the ritual timing, falsely claim there is an Underworld Prison beneath the earth where punishments are severe, misleading the world and inviting great retribution upon themselves. Now, Daoist practitioners affix talismans to communal altars and temples to prohibit ghosts, following the ancient method of drawing prisons on the earth. Once the illness subsides, the talisman is removed, and the ghosts are released, with the decree stating: ‘From this day onward, never again shall you cause harm; if you do, you will be executed.’*\n\nLao Dao/Way says: *\"When inscribing talismans and decrees to be dispatched thousands of *lǐ* (里) away or within ten thousand *lǐ*, first complete the talisman and decree without sealing or stamping them. Then perform the ritual in a purified chamber (净室), tracing the ground three times (蹑地纪), and executing the *Yǔbù* (禹步) three times—three steps, nine traces—while donning ritual attire (配衣), turning the *Tiānguān* (天关, Heavenly Barrier), and pointing in the direction of the afflicted. Focus your mind and visualize the person thousands of *lǐ* away, directly addressing the official responsible for that day’s *liùjiǎ lúnrì* (六甲轮日, hexagram cycle of days).*",

      "translated_text": "「Or it may be an uncle or cousin—brothers, aunts, or other such relatives—whose names must be specified. Both good and evil deeds are fully reported; the talisman is sealed with the *niǎnxīng* (捻星) invocation. The invocation is held in the left hand’s fourth finger at its first joint.\n\nUntil nightfall, constantly observe the celestial region corresponding to the relative’s dwelling. If a star suddenly flies away, it signifies that the Heavenly Dao (天地) has dispatched a messenger to investigate there, who will then report back. The report must be true. If no star disperses into that region’s celestial division, the report will surely be false and cannot be trusted. You must reattempt the ritual—then the truth will be revealed.\n\nIf there are stars at night, observe them carefully. If stars disperse toward that direction, the report will certainly be true.\n\nLater sages and rulers have decreed: The threefold tracing of the ground (*cèdìjì* 蹑地纪) stirs the *Tiānguān* (天关). When the *Tiānguān* dispatches a messenger to inspect and report, the account is true. If no star is sent to investigate, the report will be false—this is the deception of the talisman deities or officials. You must then reattempt the ritual, summoning the talisman deities and officials to question them again before sending the messenger. The saying goes: *\"The talisman officials, if they do not follow the prescribed ritual, must be punished according to the severity of the crime.\"* The punishment begins with the celestial decree (*kējué* 科决) ten times; once completed, it is highly efficacious—do not speak of it lightly, and always keep it secret.\n\n**Ritual for the Sovereign to Subdue Ominous Stars, Portents, and Malevolent *Yìqì* (异气) Before Disaster Strikes**\n\n*Lǎojūn* (老君) says: When ominous stars appear, portents will surely follow. Stars are the \"children of the sun\" (日生), hence the upper character is *rì* (日, \"sun\") and the lower is *shēng* (生, \"life/child\"). Thus, the sages say: *\"Stars are rebellious; they will cause ministers to betray their sovereigns, sons to defy their fathers, and disciples to abandon their teachers.\"* Such rebellious winds are often seen in this world. When the heavens display crimson *qì* (气), it is called an evil portent. These two phenomena presage the betrayal of ministers and their early demise.\n\nThe heavens, knowing of such evil portents, reveal them to mortals. Among humans, those skilled in Daoist arts (*dàoshù* 道术) can subdue them for the state—once they are ordered, these stars will not manifest. Thus, the ruler and ministers will have no worries.\n\nIf they are unaware or fail to act, the stars will appear again, aiding the state in attacking and subduing them early—this is the first great merit. When the celestial reward for this merit is complete, the practitioner ascends in broad daylight to the clouds, becoming a transcendent *xiānzhēn* (仙真).\n\nThose who understand the Dao know this. They must avoid betrayal.\n\nIf there are Daoist practitioners (*zhìdào* 志道) within this realm, and they see the stars and *qì* descending upon their region, they must quickly leave to avoid it—this brings great fortune. Never dwell in that direction, lest these Daoists lose their Way.\n\nMoreover, it is said that the *Lǐ* (李) family, inheriting the sovereign’s Daoist legacy, passed down this secret merit through generations. The heavens granted them this legacy.\n\nIf the ruler is virtuous, he will share this merit with them. *\"Lǐshēn\"* (僭申) refers to those who practice the Dao: they borrow the method of peaceful abode to aid the state, which is the later ritual.\n\nIf the ruler lacks virtue, the practitioner will change his lineage and hide his identity. He will flee to another realm, conceal his name, and this is called the *zhìrén* (志人) method for averting ominous stars.\n\n*Lǎojūn* (老君) instructs: With abstinence from meat and purification of the heart (*sùshí zhāixīn*), the mind steadies, the Daoist resolve (*zhàizhèngxīnshén*) aligns the spirit. Thus, one must purify the heart. Reside in a separate chamber for three days, avoiding women for seven days; women must also avoid men for seven days.\n\nThen, trace the ground (*cèdìjì* 蹑地纪) five times, and perform the *Tiāngāo* (天纲) once—this is the proper order. Execute the *Yǔbù* (禹步) three times: one cycle of three steps (九迹), two cycles of twelve steps (十二迹), and three cycles of fifteen steps (十五迹), before descending outside.\n\nRecite the *Dìjì* (地纪) Great Incantation (*dàzhòu* 大咒) eighteen times, don ritual attire (*pèiyī*), turn the *Tiānguān* (天关), and point toward the target. Repeat this process daily for seven days, three times each day—at dawn, noon, and dusk—for a total of twenty-one cycles. The stars will then fall, the malevolence disperse, and the state will suffer no calamity.\n\nSuch practitioners bring great merit to the state, ensuring the people’s peace and boundless blessings. Ominous stars and malevolent *qì* will be extinguished. Even if some residual *qì* lingers briefly, it will collapse within a year and a half, vanishing on its own.\n\nThis method, when applied, also requires the invocation (*niǎnxīng*). Twist the talisman toward the direction observed, determining whether it aligns with *metal* (金), *wood* (木), *water* (水), *fire* (火), or *earth* (土), and invoke accordingly.\n\nLater sages and rulers commanded the *Jiǔtiān Xuánnǚ* (九天玄女, \"Mysterious Woman of the Nine Heavens\") to descend and personally transmit the *Tenth Volume of the Outer Canon of the Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl* (*Jīnsuǒ Liúzhū Wàipiān* 第十卷, *金锁流珠外篇*), detailing the talismans and diagrams for the nine regions and ten Daoist circuits of myriad states. She taught this to *Lǐ Shìyè Jìng* (李仆射靖), who served as the Right Comrade of State (右仆射) and used divine communication to aid the state in military affairs, ensuring the people’s security with unwavering loyalty. He was thus honored as the *Shénjiàng* (神将, \"Divine General\"), commanding the *yīnbīng* (阴兵, \"Yin-forces\").\n\n*Jìng* (靖) used his divine arts to assist the state and protect the people, and the sages’ grace bestowed upon him the title of Divine General. **Note:** Already detailed in *Liúzhū* (流珠); no need to repeat here.\n\n*Lǎojūn* (老君) says: This method is called the *Luòxīng* (落星) Ritual—it knows only the method of ominous stars and removes them. There is no need to inquire about the names or lineages of those below.\n\nThis teaching reflects the *Tàishàng* (太上) Lord’s compassionate heart: seeing only the ominous stars in the heavens, he removes them for the state’s sake, without concern for the names or regions of those below. Thus, the Great Sage’s intent and compassionate words seek not to know of these individuals, hence this instruction. It is meant to guide the virtuous and noble, great regional lords, loyal ministers, and valiant generals, urging them to cultivate loyal and filial resolve, to honor and serve the heavens without wavering.\n\nIf the ominous stars are unseen in the heavens and the local *tǔdì* (土地, \"Earthly Deities\") are without malevolence, then no disaster will arise. The state will flourish, the people will be at peace, and the merit will be boundless. Often, those who act thus will ascend in daylight, attaining the rank of *Tàiqīng Zhēnrén* (太清真人, \"Perfect Person of Supreme Clarity\").\n\n**Ritual for Officials of Prefectures and Counties to Sever Disasters, Malevolent Portents, and Disturbances in Households and Families**\n\n*Lǎojūn* (老君) says: Common folk, regardless of rank, are all subject to malevolent *qì*, which may violently disrupt them, manifest as strange lights, or possess them through false apparitions. It may strike at household doors, burn dwellings, inflict illness, steal possessions, or frighten poultry and dogs. It may send venomous snakes, rats, foxes, or insects, and countless other spirits, beasts, and strange objects—all manner of blood and water entities—that invade homes as malevolent disturbances. These cannot be enumerated exhaustingly here.»",

      "translated_text": "But the malevolent *qì* of myriad disasters and disturbances—those that come to terrify and afflict people—must all be countered with written talismans (*fú*), which shall forever banish them. Three talismans are recorded here. The remaining talismans are found in the *Sān Bù Záwén* (三部杂文, \"Three Sections of Miscellaneous Texts\"), which shall be examined and extracted as needed.\n\nOnce the talismans are inscribed, the ritual commands: tread the *Jìdì* (蹑地) three times, recite the *Sān Bèi* (纪, \"Three Invocations\") three times, and perform the *Yǔbù* (禹步) three steps with nine traces. When finished, don the ritual attire, invoke the *Tiānguān* (天关), and with the left hand point toward the household of the afflicted three times. This is to summon the talisman’s power to suppress the malevolent *qì* and disturbances within that family, causing them to exhale a purple cloud and depart from the home.\n\nThen, divide and deliver the talisman to the designated *Yīnchāi* (引差) official or *Liùjiǎ* (六甲) deity of the day. The talisman shall be entrusted to the *Liùjiǎ* (六甲) deity of the day or the *Dìshén* (日神) of the *Liùjiǎ* (六甲) cycle. Present the talisman.\n\nIf the inscribed talisman is small, its power alone shall suffice to banish the disturbance. If it is large, then the talisman shall be carried as a written decree (*tiēdié*) to halt the affliction, and the effect shall not exceed one hundred days.\n\nShould the malevolent *qì* persist in its disturbances, one must then take the decree and bind the offending entity, driving it beyond the boundaries of the world. If it returns, it shall be executed without fail. Thus, malevolent disturbances shall be forever eradicated.\n\n**Talisman for Severing a Hundred Disturbances**\nThis talisman suppresses ill-omened disturbances within a dwelling—such as spectral lights, vengeful spirits, and malevolent dogs that shrink their noses and ascend to beds; boiling wells; venomous snakes and insects; or the sight of bloodied mice. The talisman shall be employed to decapitate these disturbances.\n\n*Lǎojūn* (老君) instructed *Luó Wénqiáng Tiānshī* (罗文强天师, \"Master Luo Wénqiáng of the Celestial Dao\"):\n\n\"For disturbances caused by beasts, dragons, snakes, or *qiáng* (蛟), hang this talisman on a wooden board and affix it to a bamboo pole, raising it to a height of one *zhàng* (丈) two *chǐ* (尺). Within no more than ten days, the malevolent entity shall die, and none shall dare harm others. If the disturbance stems from *guǐshén* (鬼神, \"ghostly deities\"), then a higher decree of *Chìzhāng* (赤章, \"Red Document\") must be inscribed and executed to sever the affliction permanently.\"\n\nThe *Hòushèngjūn* (后圣君, \"Later Sage-King\") further instructed the *Tiānshī* (天师):\n\n\"When dragons or *qiáng* (蛟) disturb a household, the Sage-King shall personally issue a decree. The decree shall summon the spirits of the Five Peaks (*Wǔyuè* 五岳), the Four Great Waters (*Sìshè* 四渎), the regional deities of the Nine Provinces (*Jiǔzhōu* 九州), and the communal shrines (*shèmiào* 社庙) to form a united barrier at the thresholds, pooling their strength to capture and drive the malevolent entity.\n\nOnce done, the Sage-King shall ascend to the *Tiānguān* (天关), invoke the *Tiāngāng* (天纲), and seal the earthly gateways (*dìhù*). The ritual procedure is as follows: the *Tiānshì* (天式, \"Celestial Pattern\"), *Dìshì* (地式, \"Earthly Pattern\"), * Léigōng* (雷公, \"Thunder Lord\"), *Liùrén* (六壬, \"Sixth *Rén* Day\"), *Liùjiǎ* (六甲, \"Sixth *Jiǎ* Day\"), and the Four Seasons (*Sìshí* 四时)—these seven patterns shall be employed in concert to capture and expel the malevolent entity.\n\nThe Sage-King shall issue the decree as *Kǎozhào Tiānshī* (考召天师, \"Summoning Master\"), ascending to the threshold and invoking the *Tiāngāng* (天纲) while performing the *Yǔbù* (禹步). Having donned the ritual attire and invoked the *Tiānguān* (天关), he shall march no more than twenty *lǐ* (里), and within ten *lǐ*, the dragon or *qiáng* shall be captured and brought before him.\n\nThen, perform the *Yǔbù* (禹步) three steps with nine traces three times, and advance with a mighty shout. When finished, grasp the blade (*dāozhī* 刀支) and behead the malevolent entity into two segments, thereby annihilating it permanently. This method is highly efficacious.\n\nPerform the *Jìdì* (蹑地) and *Yǔbù* (禹步) each three times, completing all three iterations. Before each iteration, recite the mighty shout. When finished, issue the great cry anew.\n\nRegardless of whether the disturbance originates in water or land, the Sage-King shall not personally transform or ascend to confront it. Instead, he shall rely upon the power of the earthly domain (*wéidì* 威地) and borrow the strength of the Dao to achieve this feat. The efficacy is profound.\n\nBut know this: when the Sage-King issues the decree, the ritual shall proceed in sequence. In the *Jìn* (晋) dynasty, *Xǔ Xùn* (许逊) performed this ritual, ascending to the heavens in broad daylight, and the heavens and earth rejoiced.\n\n*Lǎojūn* (老君) said:\n\n\"Among malevolent *qì*, none surpass the dragon, for it can ascend to the heavens. Yet if humans can capture it, the malevolent *qì* shall be drawn to the *Xīngjiàn* (星剑, 'Celestial Blade'). As for the most terrifying and potent malevolent *qì*, none surpass the *qiáng* (蛟), for it can dive into water and hide. Even so, it shall be subdued by the prohibitive arts and captured within the instant.\n\nThus, the Sage-King is born of the heavens, and his potency is extraordinary. Only by refining one’s mind and calming one’s spirit, avoiding reckless action, and maintaining contemplation of the original Master, shall the ritual be perfected and the malevolent *qì* utterly eradicated.\n\nThe blade (*dāozhī* 刀支) for the water deity, water dragon, and *qiáng* (蛟) is located on the left hand’s third finger, on the third node, to the right side. Bind it with crimson silk, and release it on the day the malevolent entity dies.\n\nSevering one dragon or *qiáng* shall yield three thousand times the merit. Ascending to the heavens in daylight, one attains the rank of *Dàxiān Zhēnrén* (大仙真人, 'Perfect Person of Great Immortality').\n\nThis method has been passed down through generations, with Daoists employing it to benefit the world and eliminate disturbances.\n\n**Ritual for Daoists to Sever Malevolent Disturbances for Households and Families**\n\n*Lǎojūn* (老君) says:\n\n\"In the world, households and families are often wrongfully afflicted by malevolent disturbances, causing unrest and insecurity. But if the Daoist presents a sincere petition to the *Dàdào* (大道, 'Great Dao') and invokes the *Kǎozhào* (考召) Master below, then the afflicted shall kneel and offer the petition. The Master shall employ the ritual to read the petition.\n\nIn later times, the *Hòushèngjūn* (后圣君) altered the command to compose a formal accusation (*zhàng*), and Daoists shall present their petitions accordingly. Officials and commoners shall submit true accusations as petitions, and the Master shall judge the accusations.\n\nOnce the judgment is complete, the *Kǎozhào* Master shall deliver the verdict, banish the malevolent entity, and issue the talisman. The current decree shall be written as a talisman.\n\nThe decree shall command: 'Bind and restrain the entity causing the disturbance, and it shall be immediately severed.' The talisman is found in the 'Miscellaneous Talismans' (*Záshìfú* 杂符文), and it is not fully recorded here.\n\nIf the petitioned entity refuses, then the Master shall employ the *Jìdì* (蹑地) three times and invoke the *Fēitiāngāng* (飞天纲) once. Another version states:\n\n'When performing the ritual, the general method is to recite the *Jìdì* (蹑地) without using the *Fēitiāngāng* (飞天纲). Perform the *Yǔbù* (禹步) after dispersing the power, and no other methods shall be employed. After dispersing the power, don the ritual attire, invoke the *Tiānguān* (天关) and point toward the afflicted, then recite the eighteen *zhòu* (咒) of the *Shíbāpiān* (十八篇). The malevolent entity shall be annihilated at the Master’s command, and it shall never again cause disaster.'\n\n*Lǎojūn* (老君) instructed *Huángdì* (黄帝):\n\n\"For the common folk who desire life, employ the *Bǎiguài Jié* (捻百怪诀). The incantation is inscribed beneath the nail of the left hand’s thumb, and one shall invoke it with the right hand’s thumb.\n\n[End of] the *Jīnsuǒ Liúzhū Yǐn* (金锁流珠引) [scroll], the twenty-fifth.\n[End of] the *Jīnsuǒ Liúzhū Yǐn* (金锁流珠引) [scroll], the twenty-sixth.\"",

      "translated_text": "The old man replied: *\"It is the Golden Star. Lǐ Shàojūn is a Great Immortal. Only he can present the Chapter and move the Heavenly Sovereign with his profound virtue—he will surely be granted permission. Others cannot.\"*\n\nThe Emperor commanded his attendants to hasten and seek him out. They found him on the thirteenth day and ordered him to present the Great Chapter. After two recitations, the Emperor fell gravely ill on the fourteenth day, his life hanging by a thread. On the fifteenth day, the Pursuing Officials appeared in a dream to the Emperor, and he was granted an additional nine years as ruler.\n\nAt that time, a celestial decree descended, stating: *\"You have obtained Lǐ Shàojūn’s Chapter of the Minor Lord, also known as Xuanzi—this is Shàojūn himself. Now present the Great Chapter of the Primordial Celestial Wagon and the Five Tombs of Reversing Death and Bringing Rebirth. You will thereby extend your lifespan, augment your celestial blessings, and be granted a new birth as a human king and sovereign lord. The earlier annotations explain this fully.\"*\n\nThe Heavenly Master imparted this Chapter, originally composed in three scrolls, which roughly aligns with the Lord Lao’s Great Chapter in minor variations but with many added benefits. This is the version now practiced in the world.\n\nThe Lord Lao instructed the Divine Farmer Emperor: *\"Though humans have a natural lifespan, many do not fulfill it. Out of a hundred, eighty or ninety will not reach their destined years—these are the unlucky ones. Why? Because human decline brings calamity, and those with little fortune will succumb to it. If fortune is abundant, it will surpass the natural limit. Beyond decline and calamity, there are those who, through harsh and violent deeds, invite their own deaths—is this not due to human actions?*\n\n*My own immortality comes from reciting these Chapters to ward off calamity, dispel decline, and preserve life and vitality. The lifespan that can be extended is thus granted, and I passed these writings to the Divine Farmer. The Divine Farmer, with his resolve to nurture life and protect vitality, possessed the nature of the Great Dao. He tested medicines to save people, used Chapters to rescue others from calamity, and compiled the Divine Farmer’s ancient texts into three scrolls: the first on Reversing Death, the second on Removing Malevolent Influences, and the third on the Auspicious Hours—this is the Chapter addressed to the Heavenly Sovereign.*\n\n*The Lord Lao said: ‘I also taught the Divine Farmer the Step of the Dry Cloud as the method for reciting the Chapters. This is the same as the ‘Walking on the Earth’ rhythm, later known as the Yu Step—this is the Dry Cloud Step. It not only saves oneself but also brings longevity. Later, I instructed my disciples to practice this method of rescue and salvation, which was passed down through generations as the Dry Cloud lineage, never broken. Now, when reciting this Chapter, one must perform the Step of the Dry Cloud, manipulate the incantations, and summon the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water to release and redeem the soul and spirit, only then may one present the Chapter to the Heavenly Sovereign and beg for an extended term—thus achieving rebirth and transcending all decline and calamity, even if one’s time has come, one will still be reborn.*\n\n*Lǐ Shàojūn has already rescued hundreds who were near death, and his disciples have long used the Dry Cloud Step to save others, all regaining their lives. The ritual states: First, issue the written Chapter. The Chapter is a declaration. When summoning the Master of the Ritual, he must first declare the Chapter, then notify the gods of the Five Mountains and Four Seas, the Nine Provinces’ ancestral shrines and community officials, and command them to first rescue and treat the afflicted, making sure to present it to the Heavenly Sovereign before the Chapter’s recitation and treatment, thus attaining approval and reaching the desired effect.*\n\n*After the Master of the Ritual receives the Chapter, he seals it with the ancestral shrines and presents it together, ordering the illness to retreat swiftly. If the illness retreats within the set days, then he must perform the ‘Walking on the Earth’ rhythm three times, dress in ceremonial robes, and turn the Heavenly Gate, always pointing to the afflicted’s palace or residence. The illness will then retreat immediately. After presenting to the Heavenly Sovereign, the illness gradually improves. Within three days, manipulate the incantations of the Chief Inspector and others, including the ‘Heavenly Heart Incantation’ and the ‘Earthly Heart Incantation.’ These three incantations are used in the ritual to seal the Chapter and prohibit the calamity.*\n\n*The incantations are found within the *Palm of Incantations*. The Heavenly Master said: ‘When the Son of Heaven presents a Chapter, he must use sincerity to govern all things. The earlier decree mentions a thousand bolts of silk and twenty stones of gold, all of which are separate ceremonial offerings for the Chapter. This Chapter does not require additional inscriptions. After presenting the Chapter, within three days there will be a report. These reports are all false, using different words to convey the message, not the actual words.*\n\n*Why? Because the Son of Heaven is of the utmost reverence, so his reports come from the Heavenly Tribunals and Earthly Registries, not in actual words. If humans were to know these false reports before the matter was approved, they might spread baseless claims. Therefore, the report uses hidden words and deep meanings, not allowing common people to know. This is the method of the Heavenly Tribunals’ reports. It is done thus.*\n\n*For the method of presenting the Great Chapter of the Primordial Celestial Wagon and the Five Tombs of Reversing Death and Bringing Rebirth to the lords of great and minor states, three-ranked and five-ranked officials, and others of high rank, the illness will be swiftly removed, and the afflicted will attain peace and safety as desired. For commoners who follow the diagram and believe in the Chapter, their illnesses will be reduced by a tenth, taking one part out of ten.*\n\n*The Lord Lao said: ‘The minor states’ lords are the sires and kings—today’s prefectural officials. Among these lords, there are ranks of high and low. For those suffering from severe calamities and illnesses, lying gravely ill upon their beds, one may first issue a written summons. The summons is like today’s sealed orders. In ancient times, the term ‘summons’ referred to a ritual seal with three stamps: the Unbeginning Five Spirits Seal, today’s Later Sage Seal. The ‘Great Sage Seal’ is the supreme seal. There is also the ‘Heavenly Tribunals Seal,’ which is the seal of the Three Heavens’ Great Sage.*\n\n*It is used to capture the Heavenly Fox and the Sacrificial Beast, as well as for the lords of minor states to treat illnesses. When receiving the talismans of the Five Deities—Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Tortoise, and Yellow Court—one uses this seal to rectify one’s true *qi*, which is employed by the Immortal Officials. The summons will prevent malevolent spirits from acting against them. Afterward, one must set a limit for a certain day when the illness will be removed and healed.*\"",

      "translated_text": "The decree of the talisman shall not be written in full. If no harm is removed, then the full decree shall be written. In ancient times, this was called the *Upper Heavenly Sovereign’s Decree*. Now it is altered to read: *\"The Most Peaceful Golden Threshold Emperor, the Morning Star, the Later Sage, the Mysterious Primordial Dao Lord\"*—also called the *Jade Emperor of Heaven*—no longer bearing the title *Heavenly Sovereign*.\n\nTo the *Upper Heavenly Sovereign*, one petitions for a direct command to the Three Officials, requesting an extension of life and added years. If granted ten or twenty years, one then recites the step-curse. This follows the method of the *First Rank* in the previous section. The *Earthly Framework Step-Curse* is prepared as before, using the *Sovereign’s Method of Step-Curse*—though the written decree and talisman differ slightly. The text of the decree is separate and not detailed here; it is not recorded in its entirety. For commoners, the priest assesses their poverty or wealth, and those who can afford it take one-tenth of this decree in faith. If they cannot, they contribute according to their means, ensuring no deficiency, lest the matter fail to reach fruition.\n\n**Method to Eliminate Locust Plagues and Protect Crops from Heavenly Fire**\nThe *Venerable Lord* says: This calamity is not wrought by Heaven, but by the local earthly spirits, who fail to assist in virtue and blessings, thus allowing the disaster to arise. On a *Bing-Yin* or *Ding-Mao* day, within the chamber, tread the *Framework* three times, with the Five Stars ascending from Wood to Fire. After three cycles, turn to the Fire Star and form the *Heavenly Pass Seal* with five pathways. Repeat this three times. Upon completion, face forward and perform the *Yu-Step* three steps, nine traces. Then, with the left hand, dispatch the talisman to the four corners of the cultivated fields, marking them with a bamboo pole twelve *chi* high. Gradually, the locust plague shall dissipate. This method is of great efficacy.\n\nThe *Later Sage Lord* transmitted the *Locust Plague Method*, found in the second joint of the left middle finger. The five-pathway talisman appears in the *Lingbao Threefold Miscellaneous Talismans* and shall not be repeated here. These five pathways originate from the *Upper Pure Capital’s Forbidden Precincts*, where the *Venerable Lord* bestowed them upon Emperor Yao to benefit the world. Thereafter, locust plagues diminished. Before Yao’s reign, the Nine Regions suffered such disasters annually.\n\n**Regulations for National and Personal Dao Cultivation, Including Ritual Instruments and Ordinances**\nFrom the *Venerable Lord’s Prohibitions and Ordinances*:\n\n**Upper Rank Celestial Daoists** must wield nine swords to assist the Celestial Venerable, subdue the Nine Wilds, and sever Heavenly Demons. They are:\n1. *Equal-Body Sword*,\n2. *Purple Smoke Courtly Venerable’s Ornamental Sword*,\n3. *Soul-Subduing Sword*,\n4. *Evil-Beheading Sword*,\n5. *True-Guarding Sword*,\n6. *Spirit-Guarding Sword*,\n7. *Heaven-Inspecting Sword*,\n8. *Daoist-Inspecting Sword*,\n9. *Self-Inspecting Sword*.\nThese are the *Heavenly Treasures*, worn as talismans.\n\n**Middle Rank Immortal Daoists** use seven swords:\n1. *Equal-Body*,\n2. *Courtly Venerable*,\n3. *Demons-Subduing*,\n4. *Evil-Beheading*,\n5. *Self-Guarding*,\n6. *Spirit-Guarding*,\n7. *Heaven-Inspecting*.\n\n**Lower Rank Summoned Daoists** use six swords, corresponding to the *Six Heavenly Stems*:\n1. *Equal-Body*,\n2. *Courtly Venerable*,\n3. *Demons-Subduing*,\n4. *Evil-Beheading*,\n5. *Self-Guarding*,\n6. *Spirit-Guarding*.\nThe first governs the body; the latter five align with *Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth*.\n\nThese sword regulations also appear in the *Later Sage Lord’s Internal Title: The Venerable Lord’s True Chronology of the World*.\n\nFor **human Daoists of the Upper Law**—those with Daoist arts to benefit the world, aid the nation, and save the people—four swords suffice:\n1. *Equal-Body*,\n2. *Courtly Venerable*,\n3. *Demons-Subduing*,\n4. *Evil-Beheading*,\nfollowing the legal ordinances.\n\n**Purple-Clad Daoists** (also of the Upper Law) use three swords:\n1. *Command-Water*,\n2. *Self-Protection*,\n3. *Evil-Beheading*.\n\n**Crimson-Clad Daoists** use two swords:\n1. *Command-Water and Purify Impurities*,\n2. *Evil-Beheading*.\nThese are the Daoists of the *Mid-Autumn Forty-Nine Ranks* and *Lower Element Eighty-One Ranks*, along with the *Single Stage Heavenly Master’s Dao* for regulating *qi*. They follow the *Heavenly Master’s Later Sage Lord’s Original Rites*.\n\nIf adhering to the *Heavenly Master’s Rites*, one falls under the false rites of *Tao* and *Lu*, who claim twenty-four ranks to govern the *Twenty-Four Qi*. They also assert that the *Lower Element* follows this pattern, but this is not the practice of the *Authentic One Red-Clad Daoists*—these are the *Blue-Clad Daoists*, who have not yet attained the *Yellow-Clad* rank.\n\nAccording to the *Original Rites*, *Yellow-Clad Daoists* are granted two swords, while *Blue-* and *Green-Clad Daoists* are permitted one.\n\nThis is the teaching of *Wind the First Master*.\n\n**General Regulations for National and Personal Dao Cultivation, Including Ritual Forms and Universal Aid**\nThe *Venerable Lord* says: Those who aspire to the Dao must first master the *Universal Spirit-Saving Method*, which summons spirits and commands ghosts—its efficacy is like the response of mouth and hand. Nothing surpasses this method.\n\nThis method employs two parallel systems: *talismans* (yang forces) and *ritual diagrams* (yin forces). As the *Classics* state: *\"Talismans are the yang army; diagrams are the yin army.\"* When these yin-yang methods are applied universally—without bias or faction—the Daoist path is established, and ascension in broad daylight becomes possible. One may traverse clouds, ascend with body and spirit intact, and even carry one’s dwelling with them. Such feats have been achieved, as evidenced by *Zhang* and *Xu*.\n\nWhen both talismans and diagrams are employed, Heaven and Earth become purified. This method’s efficacy is such that Heaven, Earth, the Sun, Moon, and Stars align in clarity, and *Taiyi* commands the subordinate forces. The divisions of Heaven and Earth, the Sun and Moon, stand unshaken. Winds and clouds disperse, and the *Magician Kings* flee in submission.",

Their ranks are divided into three titles: the first are called **Celestial Masters of the Cavernous Heavens**, the second **Record-Keepers of Fate**, and the third **Registrars of Deeds**.\n\nIf you wish to enter the Cavern, do so on the **sixth day of the third or ninth lunar month**, tracing the **Earth’s Measure** with **Yu’s Steps**—first stepping upon the **Earth’s Measure**, then performing **Yu’s Steps** three times with nine strides, followed by twelve steps, then fifteen. Upon completion, **adjust your celestial robe**, turn the **Heavenly Bolt**, and with nine movements of your fingers, point toward the **Cavern’s Gate**.\n\nOften, within no more than three or five days, the **Cavern’s Gate** will suddenly open of its own accord. If a **woman** appears, do not follow her inside. Wait until the **Jade Maiden** enters first—then, after she has advanced roughly a hundred paces, you may enter. If a **man** emerges, you may follow him without hesitation.\n\nThe **Celestial Robe**, the **Heavenly Bolt**, and the finger-movements that open the **Cavern’s Gate**—when a person exits directly, another may enter directly in turn. If a **woman** is to enter first, calculate a hundred paces ahead before following behind—this is the **Lair of the Female Immortal**.\n\n**Laozi said:**\n*'To enter the Cavern, let the light of the sun and moon illuminate your path ahead. Invoke the **Wild Boar of Wu**, the **Mandarin Duck**, the **Lion**, the **White Crane**, the **Azure Dragon**, the **White Tiger**, the **Dark Turtle**, and the **Vermilion Bird**. With your **left hand**, pinch the **Cavern’s Gate Incantation**; with your **right hand**, apply **cinnabar and ink** to the **Cavernous Heaven Incantation**.\n\nIn your **left hand**, hold a **small dagger of the Earth’s Core**—this is the **Cavernous Heaven Incantation**. On the **center of your right palm**, near the elbow’s crease, inscribe the character **地 (Earth)**. When complete, this is called the **Cavernous Heaven Incantation**. Three to two months before entering the Cavern, repeatedly apply **cinnabar and ink** to it. Upon reaching the **Cavern’s Gate**, again pinch it with your **right hand**—then it will open of its own accord, and the **Spirit** will emerge to welcome you inside.\n\nOnce you enter the **Cavern’s Gate**, it will open by itself, and the **Spirit** will guide you in.\n\n**The Method of Riding the Dragon, Mounting the Crane, and Traveling by Wind—Entering Heaven, Earth, Water, and Stone.**\n\n**Laozi said:**\n*'The **Immortal Adepts** practice such that they can **summon and tame dragons**, **control and ride cranes**. They ascend to Heaven, descend to Earth, and traverse water and stone.\n\nOn **days of the *Renchen* stem-branch (壬辰)**, trace the **Earth’s Measure** three times, then scatter into **Yu’s Steps**. On **days of the *Guihai* stem-branch (癸亥)**, recite the **Flying Steps** three times and chant the **Dragon-Riding Incantation**—the incantation is embedded within the **Flying Steps**. After three repetitions, scatter into **Yu’s Steps** three times, then **adjust your celestial robe** and turn the **Heavenly Bolt**.\n\nNow, **point to the Eastern Azure Dragon’s ancestor, Lord Meng Zhang**—surname **Meng**, given name **Zhang**. He is the **Azure Dragon General**. Roughly speaking, the **Dragon’s primordial ancestor** bore the surname **Meng**. Later descendants adopted their own branches, aligning with human surnames. Today, there are those surnamed **Cui, Lu, Li, Zheng, Jiang, Tang, Liang, Chang**, and others. In the **Jin Dynasty**, two dragons arrived from the **Khotan Kingdom**, surnamed **Tian** and **Shi**, residing in the **Jiangnan region** and **Mount TianTai**, coming and going as they pleased. These were successive generations of **Dragon descendants**, as previously recorded.\n\nNext, **point to the Southern Vermilion Dragon’s ancestor, Lord Ling Guang**—surname **Ling**, given name **Guangshi**. Roughly speaking, this is the **lineage of the Vermilion Bird General**. Later descendants changed their surnames to **Zhang, Wang, Zhao, Zhang, Yang, Ying**, and others—successive generations of **Vermilion Dragon offspring**.\n\nNext, **point to the Western White Dragon’s ancestor, Lord Jian Bing**—surname **Jian**, given name **Bing**. Roughly speaking, this is the **lineage of the White Tiger General**. Later descendants adopted the surnames **Bai, Xia, Shang, Ren, Wen, Zhen, Chen, Qian, Yuan**, and others—successive generations of **White Dragon offspring**.\n\nNext, **point to the Northern Black Dragon’s ancestor, Lord Zhi Ming**—surname **Zhi**, given name **Ming**. Roughly speaking, this is the **lineage of the Dark Turtle General**. Later descendants changed their surnames to **Liu, Pei, Yuan, Liu, Huangfu, Guan, Ruan, Kong, Shan, Chou**, and others—successive generations of **Black Dragon offspring**.\n\nFinally, **point to the Central Yellow Dragon’s ancestor, Lord Huang Ting**—surname **Huang**, given name **Ting**. Roughly speaking, this is the **lineage of the Yellow Court General**. Later descendants adopted the surnames **Ding, Dai, Lei, Rang, Mei, Zhou, Chi, He, Ge, Luo, He**, and others—successive generations of **Yellow Dragon offspring**.\n\nThese successive **Dragon descendants**, such as those surnamed **Ding, Huang, Chen, Zhao**, and others who come on **direct days (直日)**, will hasten to you. I, as the **Celestial Official**, often enter the **Heavenly Gate**, using you to **ride and guide**. Urgently respond to my summons.\n\n*Think upon Heaven and Earth—let Heaven and Earth brighten for me.\nThink upon the sun and moon—let the sun and moon shine for me.\nThink upon the rivers and seas—let the rivers and seas clear for me.\nAs I roam through Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, the **Spiritual Mountains** and the **River’s banks**, urgently summon the **Sea Dragon**—it must arrive swiftly.\nI traverse the **Eight Extremes**, ascending to the **Supreme Polarity of the Highest Purity**—urgently, as the **Law decrees**.\n\n**The Venerable Sage instructs the Heavenly Master on the Dragon-Riding Incantation:**\n\n*'Whether riding the **Dragon** or mounting the **Phoenix**, all rely on the **Heavenly Ropes of Qi**. Riding the **Wind**, the **Clouds**, the **Smoke**, the **Dust**, the **Mist**, or the **Wild Steed**—all use the **Heavenly Ropes of Qi**.\n\nThe **Yang Ropes** belong to **Heaven’s Court**, also called the **Heavenly Puff Qi**. The method of obtaining them is to know where **Heaven’s One** resides and apply the corresponding technique.\n\nAs in the **Yin-Yang Prohibitions**, there is no greater method than this.\n\nWhen the time comes, face **Heaven’s One**, kneel, close your eyes, and inhale the **Qi of Heaven’s One** through your nose. Let it transform into a **purple cloud** enveloping your body—twenty-four breaths suffice.\n\nThen, seek the **Heavenly Puff Qi** nine times as the **Guide**, and again five times as the **Heavenly Ropes Qi**.\n\nWhen moving, lie upon the **Dragon Cloud**, searching as you rise. Pinch your **left hand’s fourth finger at the second joint**, clench your teeth twenty-four times to unblock them, then **stabilize your gaze**, close your **Qi**, and let the method manifest at will.\n\nThis technique binds the **Spirit’s Core** with a **thread**, encircling the **Divine Pupil**, then seals it with the **Temporal Divine Seal**—the **Seal of the Temporal Deity**.\n\nThe **Temporal Deities** correspond to:\n- **January**: **Engaging Brightness (登明)**\n- **February**: **River Chief (河魁)**\n- **March**: **Following the Chief (从魁)**\n- **April**: **Transmission (传送)**\n- **May**: **Lesser Auspiciousness (小吉)**\n- **June**: **Victory Beforehand (胜先)**\n- **July**: **Supreme Unity (太乙)**\n- **August**: **Heavenly Ropes (天纲)**\n- **September**: **Supreme Rush (太冲)**\n- **October**: **Functionary (功曹)**\n- **November**: **Great Auspiciousness (大吉)**\n- **December**: **Divine Sovereign (神后)**\n\nThe practitioner must stand ready according to these distinctions.\n\n**Riding the Dragon or Mounting the Phoenix** depends on the **Dragon-Phoenix principles beneath your feet as the method.\"*",

      "translated_text": "「The male practitioner rides the **Dragon**, the female mounts the **Phoenix**—these are the **Temporal Deities**.\n\nIn ancient times, **Liezi** practiced the **Dragon-riding method**, thus prohibiting this technique. The female practitioner mounts the **white goose**, and **Nüwa** mounts the **crane**; all are variations of this **Phoenix-riding** prohibition.\n\nIf one desires to ride the **Dragon**, they must first take the **Tianyi qi (天一炁)** nine times to cover oneself. Then, they take the **Tianxiang qi (天罡炁)** and the **Baihu qi (白虎炁)**, each eleven times, and also strike the teeth as prescribed. The practitioner then kneads the **Du (都)** point, takes a piece of iron from the **six Gēng (庚)** days, about the size of a little finger and one inch and four tenths in length, and hides it above the **Dragon-riding principle** beneath their feet. A white thread is used as a cord to bind it forty-nine times, sealing it with **white honey (白蜜)** and marking it with the **Baihu Seal (白虎印)** and the **From the Chief Seal (从魁印)**. The **Qinglong (青龙, Azure Dragon)** then manifests, and the practitioner may ride at will.\n\nUpon completion, the seal and binding are removed. The practitioner kneads the second joint of the right thumb, exhales seven times, and the **Dragon departs**. All worldly practitioners must be cautious in this matter.\n\nThe prohibition of **Dragon-Phoenix riding** extends to **clouds, winds, mists, and dusts**—only those who seek **Daoist transcendence (求仙)** and are of the **absolute generation (绝代)** may achieve this. Otherwise, one must first observe strict **fasting (清斋)** and live in seclusion among the mountains, lest harm befall them by summoning these forces. Be cautious.\n\nThe methods for **Phoenix-riding** and **Dragon-riding** are fundamentally the same. Only the **Five Officials (五官)** of the **Temporal Deities (日神)** differ, along with the **hidden scriptures (隐文)** and **distinctive ear points (别耳)**.\n\n**Laojun (老君)** said: The **Phoenix-riding method** is also similar, but the **Dragon-riding incantation (勑咒)** merely changes the phrase to **\"eastern Azure Phoenix (青凤)\"**. The **Five Directions’ incantations (五方勑请)** are analogous to the **Dragon-riding method**, with slight variations.\n\nIn the **Phoenix-riding incantation**, the **Phoenix principle** beneath the left foot is invoked, as depicted in the diagram: *\"The Phoenix-riding incantation is this.\"* The **Dragon-riding incantation** pertains to the **Dragon principle** beneath the right foot, as shown in the diagram: *\"The Dragon-riding incantation and its principle are already mentioned above, and both are included in the Palm Diagram (掌图).\"* One may simply use a **small Dragon-Phoenix (小龙凤)** carved from **tung wood (桐木)**, painted with the five colors, and fastened to the corresponding **principle points (本文理)** beneath the feet. Five-colored threads are also used.\n\nThe **Lady of Qin (秦女)**, **Nongyu (弄玉)**, rode the **Luanfeng (鸾凤, mandarin duck and phoenix)** and traveled the **Eight Directions (八方)**, having learned these teachings from **Xiaozi (萧子)**.\n\nUpon completion, she **stepped the Ji (纪) three times**, performed the **Yǔbù (禹步)** nine times, **aligned her attire (配衣)**, turned the **Tiānguān (天关)**, and pointed toward the **eastern Azure Phoenix (青凤)** in the sky, summoning it to control and guide her. She then rode it, circling the heavens and traversing the **Eight Directions** without wearying in the **Daoist palaces (仙府)**.\n\nRegarding the method of **drawing circles on the ground to form rivers or mountains**:\n\n**Laojun (老君)** said: *\"When a practitioner of the Dao (志人修道) achieves the Dao (道成), they may move among mortals (因行人间). If they encounter malicious individuals (遇恶人) who pursue them, or thieves (贼) who wish to steal Daoist scriptures (仙经), talismans (符法), secret incantations (秘诀), or spiritual medicines (灵药), and are seen within ten or fifteen li (里), they may avoid danger by stepping into the path’s edge, stepping the Ji (纪) three times, then dispersing into the Yǔbù (禹步)—three steps, nine strides. Upon completion, they align their attire (配衣), turn the Tiānguān (天关), and point inward, transforming the ground into a river or sea (化地为江海), which the pursuers cannot cross. The practitioner then retreats and hides themselves; after the pursuers disperse, they return to the ground, which has reverted to its normal state, and alter the perception of the thieves’ eyes. In ancient times, many Daoists employed this method. If someone forcibly crosses, they will drown and die. This is because their **direct Tianqi (直炁)** movement clashes with the **Tianqi’s command to disrupt (炁干冲始要令)**—it appears as if they drowned.\n\nIf the pursuer is killed, it is by the **Northern Dipper’s martial forces (北斗中兵)**.\n\nThe **incantation of severing the pursuer’s blade (捻人刀支诀)** follows the **Five Phases (金木水火土)** incantations. Those from the **eastern direction (东方)** have names associated with **wood (木)**, those from the **southern direction (南方)** follow the **fire (火) incantation**, and the **Five Emperors (五帝)** are invoked for correspondence.\n\n**Laojun (老君)** said: *\"If a practitioner is maliciously pursued or captured by evil individuals, they must not rashly engage in killing. Instead, they should remain as before, stepping the Ji (纪) and Yǔbù (禹步), aligning their attire (配衣), turning the Tiānguān (天关), and pointing toward the grass and trees, forming a continuous mountain range (指草林木为山山相连接). They then enter this mountain and hide themselves. Once the pursuers disperse, they emerge from the mountain, which then reverts to its original state—no longer a mountain. The pursuers will be baffled by this inexplicable transformation, searching for the mountain’s location their entire lives without finding it, and eventually abandoning the pursuit.\n\nRegarding the method of **transforming vessels into the Six Jia (六甲) and Seven Stars (七星), and appearing or disappearing in the Tianying (天营, Heavenly Encampment)**:\n\n**Taishang Laojun (太上老君)**—*\"Taishang (太上)\" refers to Laojun (老君).*\"",

      "translated_text": "This is the **Taishang Laojun’s** lineage, thus the later sages of the Dao/Way reverently honor him as **Taishang Laojun**. He said: *\"Today’s people do not know this. They merely use the name Laojun, without removing the Taishang prefix, which is incorrect.\"*\n\nAs for those who cultivate the **Six Jia (六甲)**, upon completion of the second level, they attain the rank of **intermediate cultivators**. Those of the highest level, however, are **Taishang Laojun himself**, who personally wears the **Six Jia talisman**. Another highest level is the **Lingfei Six Jia talisman (灵飞六甲符)**.\n\nWhen practicing the **Ji (纪) and Yǔbù (禹步)**, upon completion of the third level, one must further receive the **San Yuan (三元) and Wu De (五德)**. **San Yuan** refers to the **San Yuan fa lu (三元法箓)**. **Wu De** refers to the **Five Deities’ talismans**: Green Dragon (青龙), White Tiger (白虎), Vermilion Bird (朱雀), Dark Tortoise (玄武), and Yellow Court (黄庭).\n\nThose who have ascended through the **Thirty-Six Stages (三十六阶)** of Dao/Way cultivation and study this method must first receive the talismans to attain full qualifications. Only then can they **communicate with the spirits**, and through this, they can point to small vessels, causing them to contain the **Heaven and Earth**.\n\nThe marvelous and divine efficacy of this method is beyond measure. In ancient times, **Master Fu Gong (壶公)** taught **Fei Changfang (费长房)** this practice. The talismans, once fully received, naturally enable spiritual communication and unpredictable transformations—one can alter a vessel no larger than a **sheng (一升)**, making it vast enough to contain the **Heaven and Earth**, just as the original creation of the cosmos unfolded.\n\nOne can also obtain the **Spring Regengzi (春庚子)** and cultivate the **Xianhu (仙壶, Immortal Vessel)**. The **Xianhu** resembles a small **gengzi (罂子)**, capable of holding **one and a half sheng (一升半)**. With careful cultivation, one takes the **Regengzi day (庚子日)**—such as the **Regengzi day in the second month**—to sow the vessel in the **east-southeast (东南)** direction of one’s residence. If a woman plants it, she must not allow a man to see afterward; if a man plants it, a woman must not see afterward.\n\nBy the **eighth month**, when the vessel is ready for harvest, leave **three to five seeds** for ripening. The scriptures state: *\"One seed left yields two; the three upper seeds are the middle. Only the middle and upper seeds are kept, while the lower ones are discarded, lest they be insufficient. Hence, more are not left.\"* Take two vessels with the **best, firmest color** and first fill them with **five catties of cinnabar (朱砂)**, though some say **six catties is the correct method**. Leave them for **sixty days**.\n\nNext, add **one to two catties of male verdigris (曾青)** into the cinnabar, leaving it for **sixty days**. Then, add **sixty days’ worth of realgar (雄黄)**. Next, introduce **two catties of female verdigris (雌黄)** and **two catties of silver mud (银泥)** into each vessel, leaving them for **sixty days** each. Following that, add **two catties of gold mud (金泥)** and **one catty of barberry wax (胡燕脂)**, each for **sixty days**.\n\nHaving inserted all **eight substances** into the vessels, each left for **sixty days**, the total duration sums to **six times eight—four hundred and eighty days**. Once this period is complete, take the vessel filled with cinnabar first and recite the **Six Jia talisman of the second level (二等符)** **four hundred times**, inserting it into one vessel.\n\nHang both vessels on the **east-southeast pillar (东南柱)** of the **Jingzhong (靖中)**, using **wooden blocks of Chinese catalpa (梓木)** to insulate them from the **earthly qi (地炁)**, preventing any disruption that might harm the vessel’s potency.\n\nOn a **Jiāzǐ day (甲子日)**, begin the **Ji (纪) and Yǔbù (禹步)**. **Ji (步)** is the **Heavenly Constraint (天纲)**, **Yǔbù (蹑)** is the **Earthly Restraint (地纪)**—thus called **Ji and Yǔbù**. Perform each **three times**. Afterward, recite the **incantations for Heavenly Constraint (天纲)** and **Earthly Restraint (地纪)** in sequence: **eighteen incantations for Earthly Restraint (地纪)**, and **twenty-nine for Heavenly Constraint (天纲)**.\n\nOnce the incantations are complete, **dissolve the form** and perform the **Yǔbù (禹步)** three times—**nine steps each time**, totaling **fifteen steps**. Then, **align attire (配衣)**, **turn the Tiānguān (天关)**, and **point toward the two vessels (指二壶)**, nine times each vessel.\n\nAfterward, recite the invocation: *\"I wish to ascend as an Immortal, transforming you to contain the Heaven. I wish to establish governance, using you to contain the Earth. Left Camp and Right Camp, Six Jia and Seven Stars. The Left Camp controls talismans, the Right Camp commands forces. When talismans and forces converge, I receive the qi of the Six Jia and Beidou (北斗). After a thousand days, it will be spiritually efficacious.\"*",

The pursuers will be baffled by this inexplicable transformation, searching for the mountain’s location their entire lives without finding it, and eventually abandoning the pursuit.\n\nRegarding the method of **transforming vessels into the Six Jia (六甲) and Seven Stars (七星), and appearing or disappearing in the Tianying (天营, Heavenly Encampment)**:\n\n**Taishang Laojun (太上老君)**—*\"Taishang (太上)\" refers to Laojun (老君).*\"",

      "translated_text": "The Master of the Pot, **Húgōng**, once taught his oral precepts to **Chángfáng**. *\"Fulfillment*—this is how we summon the divine and make it manifest. The divine transformations are boundless; they uphold me as I ascend to the Celestial Court. **Swiftly, swiftly, as the decree commands.** But only on days of the **Jia** stem, perform this—five years hence, the divine efficacy will be great, and you shall attain Immortality.\n\nThis is the **Tàishàng** receiving **Húgōng’s** oral precepts, which **Chángfáng** obtained and now transmits orally to me.\n\nThe **Lǎojūn** said: *\"He who practices the Dao must first cultivate within the heart. If a person’s heart is sincere and can contain Heaven and Earth, then practicing this method will succeed. But if the heart is unbalanced, partial, crooked, or envious—if one learns these arts only to harm others or deceive them, abandoning the straight path—then though one dwells between Heaven and Earth, one will be slain by ghosts and spirits and will not die a natural death. How much less can one, with petty tools, transform into the **Dàluó** Heaven and Earth, unless one’s heart is utterly true, one’s spirit aligned with the sacred transformations, and one’s power in harmony with the **Ming**? Much less can one execute it with true efficacy.\n\nIf you encounter one who has received this, treat their heart as a treasure, for the method will not betray you.\n\nThe **Tiānshī**, after receiving the **Hòushèngjūn’s** command from the **Beidou**’s Nine True Ones, obtained **twenty-four true laws**. These command the **Beidou**’s lords, the **Dòushén**, the **Furen**, the **Jiaonǚ**, and the **Dùbing Dùguān Fùcáo Shǐzhě**—all to be driven and transformed according to these laws. They suppress, rescue, and deliver from calamities, reverse death, traverse fire and water, command armies, and vanish in plain sight—none shall fail.\n\nObtaining this gate and using it is as swift as water and fire. The **eleventh law** is found in the **Beidou**’s **ninth upper and lower scrolls**; the **thirteenth law** is in the **twenty volumes** below the **Bázhái** section. What they govern is also spoken of extensively within the **Beidou**.\n\nThe **Beidou** are Heaven’s messengers, the bridge and crossing of the Great Dao, the path of the law-gate. Both Heaven and humankind must rely on the **Beidou’s** methods for restraint—this is their authority.\n\nThe **Tàishàng Lǎojūn** said: *\"Between Heaven and Earth, there are five **Dòu** True Ones. The **Zhōngdòu** is the chief—what mortals now call the **Beidou**. The **Zhōngdòu** is the sovereign, with the **Dìzūn** and **Yùdì** stars as his attendants. The **Beidou** is the minister, with seven consorts and favored daughters. According to mortal accounts, this too has its basis. Though the ancients called the **Zhōngdòu** the **Beidou**, no sage has yet clarified their distinction. Now, consulting the *Celestial Astronomy Diagram*, one may suspect there is another.\n\nAccording to the *Tiānshī Zhuan*, the **Hòushèngjūn** revealed the names and titles of the five **Dòu** lords and spoke of the **Dìzūn** and **Yùdì** stars in the two **Dòu**. The *Liúzhū Jīng* also states this. Thus, it is known that the **Feibù** (flying steps) belong to the **Zhōngdòu**, while the consorts and favored daughters belong to the **Beidou**. Such celestial deities hold high rank, great virtue, and heavy responsibilities, with wives and children, overseeing inspections and wielding dual authority.\n\nThe **Hòushèngjūn** also entrusted the **Tiānshī** with the *Jīnsùo Liúzhū*, a secret not to be divulged. The sacred words were not lightly bestowed upon mortals, and common folk had no means to recognize them—hence the single name by which they are called.\n\nThose of pure resolve who seek the Dao must follow this guidance to attain it—with proof and verification. When the law is applied, ghosts and spirits tremble in reverence and submit to command.\n\nNow, regarding the **Twenty-Eight Constellations**, the **Twenty-Eight Constellations’ True Guidance**—though the *Liúzhū* has already explained them, some methods are omitted and cannot be used. If they are present, they are not spoken of. Beginning from the east and turning rightward, they conclude at the **Northern Dipper’s Central Enclosure**—this too is unsaid.\n\nThose of resolve who seek the **Ultimate Dao** must always practice the **unsaid teaching**. Internally, they refine their bodies; externally, they rescue their families and others. The man of resolve, having obtained this book and its laws—the *Liúzhū*—must always follow the unsaid teaching. Internally, he depends on the law to refine his body, so that the **inner true self** is moved, the law’s efficacy is realized, and his spirit is tempered. Externally, he rescues his family and others, never practicing the external laws of **ritual speech, perception, or form**, which cause beings to cycle through the bonds of birth and death, the affections of life and death, and the hierarchies of nobility and lowliness—all of which are not the straight path.\n\nThe man of resolve must know this deeply: follow the Dao’s scriptures and practice the unsaid teaching, dwelling in **wuwei**, gradually awakening, and diligently refining himself, ascending in broad daylight.\n\nThe **Lǎojūn** said: *\"The **Dōngdòu** Lord is a man of **Wú**, surnamed **Qín**, named **Chú**, with the style **Gànfàn**. Before the **Zhōu**, he attained the Dao and was ennobled as the **Shùdòu** Lord, overseeing the seven great officials of the **East** and the **ten thousand symbols** of the **East Wilds**, as well as the seven great **hosts** of the **East**—**Jiǎo, Hèng**, and the rest. If those born under these seven hosts suffer calamities or are afflicted by malevolent stars, follow the **Liúzhū’s** spoken incantations and methods, perform the rites, and conclude by **treading the Earthly Restraint** three times, dissolving into the **Yǔbù**, turning the **Tiānguān**, and pointing **eighteen times** toward the east. Pinch the **Sìmìng** and **Dōngdòu** incantations with the left thumb’s root, reciting them swiftly. Then chant the **eighteen incantations**—the **Earthly Restraint’s eighteen incantations**—seven times. Seven times. Thus, calamities are dispelled, misfortunes averted, and sicknesses healed. This is for self-practice.\n\nThe **Tiānshī** said: If one practices this constantly for **twenty-four years**, they shall become an Immortal. If one does it for a friend or kinsman in distress, it shall also succeed. The method is performed as one’s own; only the names differ.\n\nThe **Tiānshī** said: For the **Nán**, **Xī**, and **Běi Dòu**, follow the **Dōngdòu’s** method in steps, incantations, and execution. Only their lords’ names and surnames differ, as listed in the subsequent incantations.\"*",

The **Daoist Immortal Lǐ Chúnfēng** annotated it, and the **Lawmaster of Consideration** expounded the **Method of Inspection and Circulation** (*Xūnyóu Túfǎ*). The **Tàishàng Lǎojūn** instructed the **Wújí Zhēnréng**—**Dìngguāng**—saying:\n\n*\"Surname Zhēn, given name Dìngguāng.

I do not know if this is the* **Zhēnréng Dìngguāng** *(True Immortal Dìngguāng). Perhaps he shares the same name but does not bear the surname* **Zhēn** *due to confusion. Dìngguāng attained the Dao in the* **Liù Guó** *(Six Kingdoms) era and was a* **Qín** *(Qin) man. He ascended by* **bùjí** *(measured steps), becoming the left* **Wújí Zhēnréng** *(True Immortal of the Limitless).*\n\n*To practice the* **bùjí** *(measured steps) Dao, one must first employ the* **Kǎozhào** *(Inspection and Circulation) method, benefiting all beings and establishing merit in the world of sentient beings—this is called* **xiūqiú** *(cultivation and seeking). It is the conduct of the* **Zhēnréng** *(True Immortals).*\n\n*The* **Kǎozhào** *(Inspection and Circulation) method of the Lawmasters requires first the preservation of the* **Wǔdé** *(Five Virtues/Powers):* **Qīnglóng** *(Azure Dragon), Bái Hǔ** *(White Tiger), Zhū Què** *(Vermilion Bird), Xuánwǔ** *(Dark Tortoise), and Huángtíng** *(Yellow Court)—these are the* **Wǔdé Jiāngjūn** *(Five Virtues/Power Generals).*\n*In ancient times, when the* **Lǎojūn** *(Laozi) promulgated this method, there were first the* **Sānyuán** *(Three Primordials), followed by the* **Wǔdé** *(Five Virtues/Powers).*\n*Now, according to the* **Jīnluó Liúzhū Tú** *(Golden Talisman Flowing Pearl Diagram), the* **Wǔdé Jiāngjūn** *(Five Virtues/Power Generals) are depicted, yet the* **Sānyuán** *(Three Primordials) are absent. Perhaps the* **Sānyuán Jiāngjūn** *(Three Primordial Generals) were separately illustrated in three graded diagrams:* **Hán Hóng Tú** *(Primordial Diagram of the Upper Primordial), Zhōngyuán Tú** *(Diagram of the Middle Primordial), and Xiàyuán Tú** *(Diagram of the Lower Primordial). Their use is unified in the* **Hán Hóng Tú** *(Primordial Diagram of the Upper Primordial).*\n*The* **Sānyuán** *(Three Primordials) are further accompanied by the* **Liù Jiǎ** *(Six Jia Days):* **Liù Dīng Liù Jiǎ** *(Six Ding and Six Jia), the* **Yùnǚ Zhēn Guān** *(Jade Maidens and True Officials).*\n*The* **Liùjì Shí'èr Shén Guān** *(Six Restraints and Twelve Divine Officials), along with the* **Liù Róng Bā Mán** *(Six Rong and Eight Man tribes), must all be preserved as per the scriptures, ensuring their proper deployment.*\n\n*When descending into the mortal realm, they suppress the malevolent, obstinate, and rebellious* **yāojīng** *(demonic spirits), preventing harm to all beings. They are summoned according to the prescribed methods. If they refuse to comply, they are bound by incantations as per the law. If they still do not submit, they are* **bùdòu** *(confronted in battle),*\n*—that is, the* **jì Dìjì** *(Earthly Restraint) method, which follows later—*\n*and then they are decapitated. Upon completion, a proclamation is issued to the ancestral shrines to forbid such spirits for a set number of years, determined by the Lawmaster’s household according to the month, day, and hour. A talisman is then given to that person, corresponding to the specified term.*\n\n*To perform the* **bùdòu** *(battle method), one must first practice* **jì Dìjì** *(Earthly Restraint) three times in a purified chamber, dispersing into* **Yǔbù** *(Yu’s Steps)—fifteen steps in total—while wearing the prescribed attire. One then points to the location of the afflicted person’s household, or to the site for exorcism, as per the diagram. Lǐ Chúnfēng** *(Li Chunfeng) said: The immortals always preserve this diagram for use in ascending to the* **Zhēn Cháo** *(True Court) or exorcising a dwelling. It must be kept and applied as needed. One must always consider the original master first, then oneself following the master, never placing oneself before the master.*\n\n*The* **Hòushèng Jūn** *(Later Sage-King) said: Those who earnestly seek the Dao must preserve this diagram every ten days. While traversing the world and its lands, they lead the generals and soldiers, advancing tens of miles beyond—akin to a great general deploying troops and forming battle arrays. They also preserve the* **Shèyù Qiánjūn** *(vanguard troops),*\n*—the* **vanguard* **being the* **Hányuán Jiāngjūn** *(Upper Primordial General)* **Táng** *(Tang), the* **Zhōngyuán Jiāngjūn** *(Middle Primordial General)* **Gě** *(Ge)—marching left and right—while the* **Zhū Què Jiāngjūn** *(Vermilion Bird General) stands in the center, guiding the way as per the law. They brandish red halberds, banners, and flags, encircling the* **Zhōu Jiāngjūn** *(Zhou General) and the* **Wǔdé Jiāngjūn** *(Five Virtues/Power Generals) in multiple layers, uniting with the* **Xuánwǔ Liùjì Jiāngjūn** *(Dark Tortoise Six Restraint Generals) to form several battle formations. These fly through the sky, their banners and flags resplendent, covering heaven and earth, unstoppable by any foe. The original master also leads at the forefront.*\n*They charge and annihilate the malevolent, obstinate, and demonic spirits.*\n*Returning to formation, they shield the* **Zhèngzhēn Zhī Qì** *(True Qi of the Supreme Truth) and the body of the practitioner. They also rescue those who have yet to awaken from calamities and disasters, aiding the nation in stability, delivering those in peril, and dispersing warring armies when they clash. The practitioner’s prolonged sojourn in the world is a means of accumulating* **yīn gōng** *(merit in the unseen), and when this merit is complete, they ascend as an immortal.*\n\n*This method is supremely efficacious, yet it must be kept secret and not recklessly transmitted to unworthy individuals.*\n\n*The* **Lǎojūn** *(Laozi) said: The* **Jīnluó Tú** *(Golden Talisman Diagram) contains only the* **Wǔdé Jiāngjūn** *(Five Virtues/Power Generals), omitting the* **Sānyuán** *(Three Primordials). This is because the* **Wǔxíng** *(Five Phases) are deployed externally to rescue beings, while the* **Sānyuán** *(Three Primordials) internally guard the practitioner. The* **Sānyuán** *(Three Primordials) are stationed within, and the* **Liùjì** *(Six Restraints) and their retinues are bound within them to protect the practitioner’s body from malevolent ghosts.*\n\n*The* **Tiānshì** *(Celestial Master) transmitted this to the* **Hòushèng Jūn** *(Later Sage-King), whose Daoist merit and power were slight, insufficient to rescue others. Thus, he could only guard himself, and the* **Sānyuán** *(Three Primordials) were preserved internally through their upper, middle, and lower diagrams, found in the* **Hán Hóng Zhèngyī** *(Supreme Primordial of the Upper Primordial). The upper diagram is in* **Hán Hóng** *(Primordial Encompassing), while the middle and lower diagrams are in separate* **Zhèngyī** *(Supreme Primordial) diagrams. The* **Wǔxíng** *(Five Phases) rescue beings, the* **Sānyuán** *(Three Primordials) shield the practitioner, and the* **Liù Jiǎ** *(Six Jia Days) capture ghosts—*\n*—the* **Liù Jiǎ** *(Six Jia Days) are the direct* **Fú Mǎ** *(talismanic soldiers), following the sun and moon, and aiding in the pursuit and capture of evil ghosts.*\n*The* **Qīdòu** *(Seven Battles) invoke the gods. All gods are the* **Běidǒu Shī** *(ministers of the Northern Dipper), who arrive swiftly upon being summoned. This is the* **Tiānshì** *(Celestial Master), the* **Běidǒu** *(Northern Dipper) itself. Yet, within a single day and night—one cycle of heaven—they inspect and patrol all the myriad gods of the earth, aligning with the* **Liù Jiǎ** *(Six Jia Days) in their cosmic harmony.*\n\n*In the* **Jīnluó Tú** *(Golden Talisman Diagram), the* **Yùnǚ Guìfēi** *(Jade Maidens and Noble Consorts) are depicted first, leading and guiding the* **Kǎozhào Fǎshī** *(Lawmasters of Inspection and Circulation).*\n*The* **Liù Jiǎ** *(Six Jia Days) include the* **Liù Yùnǚ** *(Six Jade Maidens), and the* **Běidǒu** *(Northern Dipper) has* **Qī Guìfēi** *(Seven Noble Consorts), all of whom are celestial maidens. Since ancient times, the* **Jīnluó Tú** *(Golden Talisman Diagram) has recorded this, and now it is the* **upper section of the* **Jīnsuǒ Liúzhū** *(Golden Lock Flowing Pearl) text.* *The* **Yùnǚ Guìfēi** *(Jade Maidens and Noble Consorts) are shown first, leading the Lawmaster at the forefront. This is to honor the Lawmaster in accordance with ancient practice.*\n\n*This* **Xūnyóu Túzhèn** *(Inspection and Circulation Diagram Formation) is not singular in purpose but encompasses myriad applications. It may be used by kings, emperors, and nobles to heal illnesses, or to rescue beings from disasters and calamities. It may also be employed to deliver soldiers from peril, or when a practitioner encounters bandits, ferocious beasts, or is separated by water and fire. Or when there are epidemics and contagious diseases, or when malevolent humans and ghosts conspire to harm within a dwelling. Or when the children of* **Dàoshì** *(Daoists) and* **Shìjiè** *(Buddhists) clash in their methods, causing confusion and discord. Or when curses, sacrifices, and rituals contradict one another, leading the practitioner’s heart astray and their intentions awry. Or when officials falsely claim power to harm others, or when they fabricate petitions and memorials, falsely invoking ghosts and gods, recklessly submitting them—such calamities and misfortunes, all may be resolved by this* **Xūnyóu** *(Inspection and Circulation) method, bringing justice to all beings.\"*",

      "translated_text": "「First, one must inspect and circulate for one’s own family, then proceed to others. This method is supremely subtle and wondrous; it must not be recklessly practiced or transmitted—be cautious.\n\n*Lǎojūn* (Laozi/Old Master) says: \"For those who wish to resolve the myriad prior calamities, they must first cultivate *Xūnyóu* (Inspection and Circulation) daily, storing one *qi* (存一, *cún-yī*) to perambulate that household. Thus, all toxins dissolve, all gods and spirits perish, and misfortunes are dispelled.\n\nWhen first embarking upon the perambulation, one should first enter a pure chamber and tread *Yǔbù* (the Earth Step, *Yúbù*) three times, then scatter into *Gǔbù* (Turtle Steps, *禹步*). Three steps make nine traces, exhaling *qi* as a purple cloud, first covering one’s own body.\n\nOnce done, proceed to that household, covering the surrounding houses and the person’s body entirely. Whether in battlefields or myriad afflictions, all shall respond instantly and be resolved.\n\nFor all things respond to completion. Then, pinch the *zuǒ dūjiān* (Left Marshal, 左都監) and *yòu dūjiān* (Right Marshal, 右都監), followed by the *Yóushī jué* (Perambulation Master’s Secret, 游師訣) and the *Sānshī jué* (Three Masters’ Secret, 三師訣).\n\nAfterward, don the ceremonial attire—*Qíqǔn* (Seven Battles, 七斗成)—where the seven stars and seven battles are all present upon the body. Grasping the *Zhìxīng* (Executive Star, 魒星), point to it three times, then recite the five verses of the *Dìjì zhòu* (Earth Step Sutra/Chant, 地紀咒).\n\nThe *Hòushèng* (Later Saints) taught the *Tiānshī* (Celestial Master’s) oral secrets: for great matters, always recite the *Dìjì zhòu* (Earth Step Sutra) in its entirety of nineteen verses, which is the highest. Nothing shall fail to respond as desired.\n\nPointing three times, all matters dissolve and perish instantly. Thus, one’s endeavors shall succeed, and all harm shall vanish, neither affecting oneself nor others.\n\nThe chant reads:\n*\"Tàishàng chuánjiào, hòushèng liúxíng.*\n*Tiānshī qīnshòu, jiǔqiān wànbīng.*\n*Xúnchá shífāng, shìqì sānqīng.*\n*Shén wú xiōngdǎng, guǐ wú yāojīng.*\n*Rén guǐ gèjū, bùdé yǒu zhēng.*\n*Xínghuò zhě sǐ, xíngfú zhě shēng.*\n*Huòfú wú zhī, suíshǒu fēnmíng.*\n*Zuǒ zhǐ sānmiè, yòu zhǐ sìqīng.*\n*Wù fàn wú dào, wú dào shèn píng.*\n*Yǒuzuì wúshè, wúzuì zìníng.*\n*Tiān cì wú fǎ, lìng wú ànxíng.*\n*Mò fàn wú wēi, wēi měng qīxīng.*\n*Yǐn rǔ xuè, shí rǔ jīng.*\n*Yīqiè dàn píngděng, wú dào bù lìng xíng.*\n*Yīqiè xīn dúpài, wú dào lìng zhǎnxíng.*\n*Jíjí rúlìng shìng.*\n\nUpon completing the chant, one must then visualize the diagram as instructed. The diagrams are of three ranks, as follows:\n\nThe first rank is the diagram of *Gǔbù* (Turtle Steps) and *Qǔndǎ* (Fist Battles, 拳打) from the *Liúzhū* (Falling Pearls, 流珠) upper volume, specifically the third step of the *Jīng* (Scripture, 纲) and the ceremonial attire for the *Qǔndǎ* (Fist Battles).\n\nThe second rank includes the diagrams of the *Sānyuán Sānwǔ* (Three Five Three-Element Generals, 三五三元) and the ceremonial attire for the generals.\n\nThe third rank encompasses the diagrams of *Zhōngyuán* (Mid-Element, 中元), *Xiàyuán* (Lower Element, 下元), and *Shàngyuán Hánhóng* (Upper Element Encompassing Grandeur, 上元含弘), as well as the *Liúshū* (Falling Pearls, 流珠) diagrams.\n\nThe practitioner who stores and implements this method shall achieve true results.\n\n*Lǎojūn* (Laozi/Old Master) says: \"Those who practice the *Kǎozhào* (Summoning and Inspecting, 考召) method and perambulate the ten directions of the world, rescuing and guiding beings, always acting in equanimity, benefiting the state and their own families, aiding people and saving all things, and performing meritorious deeds between heaven and earth—when their virtue is complete, the *Tàishàng* (Highest Venerable) shall command celestial beings to escort them upward, granting them the position of *Dàxiān Zhēn* (Great Immortal True Person, 大仙真). They shall ascend to the heavenly palaces in broad daylight.\n\nIn ancient times, there was a *Rénhuáng* (Human Sovereign, 人皇) who constantly performed hidden virtues for the people, reverently honoring the four categories of heaven, earth, water, and fire, and never failing to uphold them. Moreover, he would daily visualize his own body, perambulating the world within his mind, inspecting and judging beings, ensuring fairness and justice. Those who suffered wrongs or bore grievances wished to see their cases resolved, and in their dreams, they would encounter the *Rénhuáng* (Human Sovereign), who would explain their grievances to them. For fourteen years, he consistently cultivated this method, and whenever common folk faced injustice or bore grievances, they would dream of the *Rénhuáng* (Human Sovereign) resolving their cases. Upon waking, each would know their own guilt, and both parties would blame themselves. Countless thousands of people experienced this.\n\nWhen his virtue was complete, the *Tàishàng* (Highest Venerable) granted him longevity, making him the *Rénhuáng* (Human Sovereign) with a lifespan of eighteen thousand years. Later, he ascended to the *Xiānqiū* (Celestial Mound, 玄丘) as an immortal.\n\nIn ancient times, there was a *Shùshì* (Magician, 術士) named *Lèbā* (樂巴), who skillfully practiced *Cúnxī* (Storing Thought, 存思) and the perambulation of the world, rescuing and aiding beings, subduing gods and pacifying spirits. For decades, he benefited people, and the populace erected temples in his honor across several districts.\n\nSuddenly, a calamity struck the district, and the people sacrificed to *Lèbā* (樂巴). The calamity dispersed instantly. It was not because *Lèbā* (樂巴) himself possessed divine communication, but because his *cúnxī* (stored thought) and visualization evoked a response. Furthermore, the spirits and gods feared and respected his practice, foreknowing their own fate, and thus retreated and dispersed in advance.\n\nThus, it is known that this method’s divine communication is supremely wondrous. *Lǎojūn* (Laozi/Old Master) once descended to *Shǔjùn* (Sichuan District, 蜀郡) and told *Lèbā* (樂巴): \"This method has seven extraordinary powers: first, it can rescue people and establish merit; second, it can command the reverence of ghosts and spirits; third, it can swiftly attain the Dao of immortality; fourth, it can enter battlefields without injury; fifth, it can enter water, fire, and epidemics without contamination; sixth, it can dispel all slander and disputes, both public and private; seventh, it can establish prohibitions against all venomous serpents, fierce beasts, and toxic creatures, compelling them to suppress their malevolent hearts so they dare not harm others—this is most efficacious.\n\nTo practice the *Kǎozhào* (Summoning and Inspecting) method, one must first, under a clear master’s guidance, receive the *Běnjīng guì* (Scripture and Talisman of the Original Scripture, 本經箓). The *Běnjīng guì* (Scripture and Talisman of the Original Scripture) refers to the *Jīnsuǒ Liúzhū* (Golden Lock Falling Pearls, 金鎖流珠). There are diagrams within the scripture, such as the *Sānyuán Wǔxíng* (Three-Element Five-Phase, 三元五行) method.\n\nOne version states: ‘There are no Three-Element Generals, only the Five-Phase Generals’ diagram, along with the *Liùjiǎ Qīxīng Yùnǚ* (Six Celestial Stems Seven Stars Celestial Maiden, 六甲七星玉女) diagram.’ Each of the Three-Element Generals has their own diagram, which is why they are drawn out. The three generals of the *Shàngyuán* (Upper Element, 上元) are included within the *Hánhóng* (Encompassing Grandeur, 含弘) diagram. Within the *Hánhóng* (Encompassing Grandeur) diagram, the sun, moon, and three elements, the five phases, six celestial stems, seven stars, eight trigrams, and nine palaces, as well as the *Léitíng Yǔshī Fēngbó* (Thunder and Lightning Rain Masters Wind Lords, 雷霆雨師風伯), are all depicted in full detail.\n\nOnly after three years may one receive this *Yǐnshū* (Summoning Scripture, 引書). If one has not yet received it, they must not dare to view this text. This text is the *Yuánshǐ qì* (Primordial Beginning *Qi* of Heaven and Earth, 天地元始氣), structured into scripture by the *Zhēnrén* (True Person/Immortal, 真人).

      "translated_text": "The world was filled with crafty sorcerers, so the Immortals concealed their secrets and ceased transmission.\n\nThe earlier Immortals, after ascending, left behind their unparalleled secrets for seven hundred years without successors.\n\nAt the beginning of the Later Jin dynasty, there were the **Zuo** brothers—**Zuo Yuanfang**, a man of Jiangdong, and **Xu Xun**, a man of Qin, now in Jingyang County of Shu. They succeeded in their Daoist lineage.\n\nAt the source of Hongji in Jiangxi, they took ten disciples, all of whom became Immortals. Practicing this method, they wandered to heal the world, cultivated virtue, and one by one ascended.\n\nAmong the later eleven disciples, none took further disciples, and the lineage of Immortals thus ended.\n\nA hundred years later, at the start of the Qi dynasty, the transmission resumed with **Ge Xuan** as disciple. After Ge Xuan’s era, two generations of **Zheng Siyuan** followed, yet no one could succeed them.\n\nScholars only spoke of the *qi* (器)—the great vessel, like the Confucian term *shuò* (硕)—yet none possessed even a single *hè* (合) of it. This was a metaphor for the world’s loss of the Immortal Way.\n\nThe **Laozi** told **Yin Xiānsheng**:\n\n*\"The Wandering Method—if one wholeheartedly seeks its use, nothing will be beyond one’s divine power. A single thought moves, and nothing obstructs it: above, it connects with Heaven; below, it connects with Earth; within, it connects with humanity; subtly, it connects with the numinous. Thus, one can repel ghosts and save people, never missing in a hundred uses, and no thousand evils dare approach.*\n\n*In ancient times, Guangcheng Jun taught the Yellow Emperor to use this method, enabling him to attain *Tiānzhēn* (Heavenly Purity). The Mysterious Woman instructed the Yellow Emperor in this Wandering Method, and after nine years, his mastery extinguished ghostly threats and transformed his Dao. He rode the Ox and Horse to pacify the people—this was the Lady of the Fan clan. Through dream-wandering, she was inspired by the Immortal’s leveling method—this was Wang Jun. Those who wandered and paid respects were the Ten Thousand Spirits and Heavenly Masters, the Wandering Immortal’s music. The True Person of the Celestial Connection wandered to rescue all beings. The Perfected One’s Wandering was met by the Ten Thousand Emperors. The Later Sage’s Wandering saw all the Celestial Beings come to greet, paying homage to the Ten Thousand Saints, subduing the Hundred Spirits, and nurturing all living beings.\"*\n\nRegarding the **Summoning Method for the Six Star Lords of Longevity**—the diagram for invoking the Six Star Lords of the Southern Dipper:\n\nThe **Laozi** said:\n*\"The Six Star Lords of Longevity are the Six Star Lords of the Southern Dipper. Flying from east to west, the Master focuses his mind toward the east, receiving them below. He also focuses on the Twelve True Persons flying from west to east, turning his face southward, gazing left and right. He further focuses on the Left Marshal of Destiny and the Right Marshal of Records, who oversee registries and calculations, all arriving together, riding flying dragons and phoenixes, dragons pulling grand chariots, with celestial boys and jade maidens holding the Ten Absolute Auspicious Banners. They scatter fragrant flowers in spiraling patterns, covering the sick person’s bed, scattering all manner of blossoms onto the patient’s body, penetrating to the bones and joints.*\n\n*The medicines are administered by the Marshals of Destiny and Records, who then charge the household to guard the home.

      "translated_text": "The **Command** is the vital body itself. What mortals receive at birth as their assigned fate and virtue is their official rank and the land where they draw their stipend—all subject to life and death. The perils of life and death arise from the Five Phases clashing and malevolent spirits conspiring in their operations. If one foreknows this, then from within the Five Phases, one may calculate and restrain them, halting the affliction at once. If they refuse, one may tread the *dìjì* (地纪) three times, don the *dòuyīn* (斗身衣), seize and behead them—thus permanently severing the calamity. Then the person may freely pursue cultivation and attain eternal life.\n\nThis method further draws upon the Five Phases’ central alignments. Later, the Sage Emperor instructed Master Yin the True Person: *\"To study the Dao, you must know the Six Jia Days. The Six Jia—Jiazi, Jiaxu, and the like—are six days in succession. Tread the *dìjì* three times, then scatter into the *Yǔbù* (禹步), three steps with nine traces, afterward donning the *dòuyīn*, preserving the Two Scenes and Three Elements, the Four Seasons’ *Qīnglóng* (青龙), *Báihǔ* (白虎), *Zhūquè* (朱雀), and *Xuánwǔ* (玄武)—these are the Four Seasons’ overseers of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. The Five Phases: as the Classics say, the Four Seasons’ deities, with the addition of the Yellow Court General, are called the Five Phases. It is also said: In Heaven, they are the Five Stars; on Earth, the Five Forms; in Man, the Five Phases—these are the Five Virtues, sealed by the Most High with their names.\n\nThe Six Jia are the direct-day deities and the Jade Maiden’s Lord. The Seven Stars are the Dipper; the Eight Trigrams are the eight directions of Earth. The Nine Palaces encompass Earth and the Central Palace, with the Human Sovereign’s likeness marking the Nine Provinces’ names, elucidating the Nine Palaces’ count. The Three Elements: one element yields three, hence ‘three threes as nine,’ all within the Five Phases. The Nine Palaces, adding the Central Palace, are called the Nine Numbers. It is also said: the Small Nine Palaces are the Nine Provinces’ lands. In the age of the Human Sovereign, this was also called the Nine Palaces—this explains the Small Nine’s count. Today, between Heaven and Earth, the eight directions and the Central Palace’s ninefold count are vast. Hence Zhuangzi said: Heaven has nine wilds, called the Nine Palaces. [Here follows the] containment of thunder and lightning strikes, as depicted in the diagram. The diagram is fully contained within the *Hán-Tóng Tú* (含弘图); retain its use. All methods are preserved for application. For warding off calamities, also employ the pinching technique of the Six Star Lords of Fate.\n\nOften thus, one may save one’s own family and others’ illnesses, rescuing the dying and restoring life. Practicing this for six years, the Southern Dipper extends longevity, and the Six Star Lords—including the Lords of Fate and Records—descend to meet you, speaking of your merits in saving lives and healing diseases, and escort you to ascend to the Upper Clarity.\n\nThe Celestial Master told the Emperor: *\"There are nine grades to this method. The first is to cultivate and remove one’s own calamities and illnesses. The second is to heal one’s family and kin. The third is to treat the illnesses of kings and ministers, each with its own rank and prescribed method. The highest is to treat the Son of Heaven’s ailments. First, contemplate the Upper Element’s Upper Division’s Tang General, then the Upper Element’s Middle Division’s Li General, then the Upper Element’s Lower Division’s Xu General, then the Middle Element’s Upper Division’s Tang General—this Tang is surnamed Tang, named Hóng, succeeding the Upper Element’s Upper Division’s Tang General in years. The Upper Element’s Tang General, named Duàn, was a man of the Heavenly Sovereign’s era, attaining the Dao with a body nine hundred million *zhang* long. The Middle Element’s Middle Division’s Ge General was a man of King Mu’s time, far removed in years. Next is the Middle Element’s Lower Division’s Zhou General—also from King Mu’s era, a minister of his court. Then come the Three Generals of the Lower Element: Li Huangwang. They were men of the Six Dynasties. Li General was surnamed Li, named Lìzhì, a native of Kuàiji Mountain. In the Qin era, he attained the Dao, and the Most High appointed him as the Upper General of the Lower Element. Next, contemplate the all-pervasive [method], as depicted in the diagram.

All assemble in a certain realm.\n\nThe altar is set with thirty-four seats: seven to the east, seven to the south, seven to the west, seven to the north, seven in the central palace, two for the Eight Trigrams, two for the Sun Palace, two for the Moon Palace, and the remaining nine seats for the Seven Ancestors, totaling forty-nine. The platform is built with yellow earth spread upon the ground, with mats laid above, and upon the mats, green silk cushions for sitting, as prescribed.\n\n*\"As prescribed\"* refers to the complete ritual for summoning the Six Longevity Star Lords, with their full ceremonial texts. The ritual text, once complete, already includes all required items and their proper counts—here, it is summarized rather than fully detailed.\n\nUpon completion, meditate upon the Six Longevity Star Lords, as well as the Lords of Destiny and Records, and perform the rites according to the previous methods. No illness treated will fail to heal.\n\n**Second Rank (for nobles and high officials):**\nTo treat the ailments of princes and ministers, first invoke the Upper Division’s Middle Element Li General, then the Middle Division’s Middle Element Ge General, and finally the Lower Division’s Middle Element Huang General. With the ritual fully prepared, meditate upon the Six Longevity Star Lords, the Lords of Destiny, and the Lords of Records, extending life and curing disease through the prescribed steps and incantations—no illness will resist.\n\n**Third Rank (for officials and commoners):**\nFor governors, county magistrates, and the populace—regardless of gender—first meditate upon the Upper Division’s Lower Element Xu General, then the Middle Division’s Lower Element Zhou General, and finally the Lower Division’s Lower Element Wang General. With the ritual fully prepared, summon the Six Longevity Star Lords, the Lords of Destiny, and the Lords of Records to descend, prolonging life, curing disease, and saving those at the brink of death. Results manifest instantly.\n\nFor treating all manner of illnesses, these three ranks suffice—none will fail. The talismans are found in *The Three Departments’ Miscellaneous Talismans* (《三部杂符》), named according to the ailment, and all will prove effective when entrusted to the proper authority.\n\n**Fourth:** Able to enter battlefields, rendering one unseen by harm or defeat, protecting oneself and others. The method follows as before, with talismans provided separately. These talismans appear in *The Yellow Emperor’s Gathered Mysteries* (《黄帝集灵记》), Volume One.\n\n**Fifth:** Able to enter water, seizing water spirits, dragons, and aquatic creatures of the fish and reptile kind. The method involves stepping the *Earth Memoir* (地纪) seven times and the *Flying Heavenly Rope* (飞天纲) seven times. This is the *Flying Steel Rope*—though not traced on the diagram, one need only visualize the steps upon the ground as per the illustration to achieve it. If mastery of the steps is attained, the *Flying Rope* need not be invoked; visualization alone suffices. In urgent matters, focus the mind, recite the hand seals, and chant the incantation—divine response follows instantly. Why bother with steps or diagrams?\n\nIn ancient times, the Daoist adept Zhao Rui practiced the *Memoir-Rope* method for fourteen years. Upon attaining the Dao, he could summon its power with mere thought, requiring no steps. He habitually walked the *Yujian Steps* (禹步), nine strides nine times, mastering the Nine Rivers. He also transformed into twelve steps, governing the Four Seas. Binding his feet with six *ji* (己) earth seals allowed him to enter water as if walking on land.\n\nAt the moment of entering water, he would recite the *Six Wu* (六戊) incantation, commanding the water spirits at will—all obeyed.\n\n**Sixth:** Able to guide one through mountains and grasslands without losing one’s way, causing venomous serpents and fierce beasts to submit, and entering fire without harm. All effects manifest as per the previous methods.\n\n**Seventh:** Able to lead one into the Middle Immortal path, achieving longevity and immortality. On one’s birth-day, meditate upon the Southern Dipper’s Six Longevity Star Lords, as well as the Lords of Destiny, Records, Registers, and Fate-Calculations descending as per the diagram. The diagram appears in *The Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl* (《金锁流珠》), Middle Section.\n\nUpon completion, step the *Earth Memoir* and *Flying Rope*—the *Earth Memoir* and *Heavenly Rope*. Scatter the steps, adjust the attire, and recite the nineteen incantations while manipulating the seals. Then recite the *Lords of Destiny* seals, found in the *Flowing Pearl*’s Lower Section, Volume. Finally, chant the nineteen incantations. Upon completion, cease. Practicing thus for four years grants the rank of Earthly Immortal.\n\n**Eighth:** Able to lead one to the Great Immortal path. The Great Immortal is the celestial and terrestrial sage.

      "translated_text": "「The Great True Sage of the Central Realm, Lord of the Dao, **Fāng Píng Zhāng Dàolíng**, **Zhào Shēng**, **Wáng Chǎng**, **Lǐ Zhòngfǔ**, **Máo Yíng**, **Xǔ Yùfǔ** and others, are successive compilers of this text. The Daoist Master **Lǐ Chúnfēng** annotated it. The **Consideration and Summoning Master** expounds the method of **invoking the Wood Official (木官)** to **erect a house (起屋)** and heal illness.\n\nThe **Venerable Laozi** instructed the **True Person of Saving the Suffering (救苦真人)**, **Zhèng Rén'ān**, saying: *\"As a True Person practicing the Dao, nothing surpasses saving those afflicted with grave illness.\"* To save one person’s illness, the heavens and earth record it as one merit.\n\nThe human body is called a *dwelling-place (舍宅)*, akin to a house. Thus, to heal the sick, one invokes the **Wood Official (木官)**. The Wood Official is, among the Five Phases, the one who governs wood. For instance, if a person born in the **Year of Jiāzǐ (甲子)** has a **Metal Destiny (金命)**, then **Wùchén Wood Official (戊辰木官)** is invoked as the superior—never **Rénwǔ Wood Official (壬午木官)** to erect a house, lest harm befall the patient.\n\nWhen descending, align with the patient’s **main house (正屋)** and **auxiliary house (正屋)**, as if tracing a diagram. **Felling trees to erect the main house**, **repairing beams and pillars**. Thus, in three days, all illnesses retreat and abate. Further, it is said: *\"When a person’s illness is grave, and you, as a master, seek to heal them, merely visualize the patient’s main house and its trees felled—it shall manifest, and the illness shall retreat.\"* The scripture states: *\"House upright, body upright; house crooked, body crooked. House fallen, body fallen.\"*\n\nAnother passage says: *\"The human body is a house; if the surrounding trees are numerous, the soul and spirit scatter from the body and cling to the trees, often seen by others as luminous figures—these are the souls and spirits of the ailing.\"* As a healer, first invoke the **Wood Official** to **fell the trees on either side of the patient’s dwelling**, then **summon the wood and the illness**, constructing a house upon the **birth-qi (生炁)** of the land. The patient’s **Six Heavenly Stems (六甲)** and **Twelve Earthly Branches (行年)** determine the birth-qi location, or also **search the year’s birth-qi** to erect the house, or **repair the existing dwelling**. If all three houses are upright, the patient’s **three souls (三魂)** remain steadfast. But if one house is crooked, one soul shall not be fixed.\n\nFor the healer, first master this method, and it shall prove efficacious. The patient’s illness shall retreat, their spirit returning to the body. That night, they may dream of **ascending sages entering a valley of half-suffering (上仙入谷半苦)**—this is the spirit’s return. Upon waking, they sweat profusely, a sign of great recovery.\n\nThe **Venerable Laozi** said: *\"This method has two applications: one to heal a person’s illness, the other to subdue rebellious subjects, disobedient children, or disciples who defy their master’s commands—then apply this method to them.\"* The practice is similar to the previous.\n\nThe **Venerable Laozi** said: *\"For this method, first tread the **Earthly Trigrams (地纪)** three times, then scatter into the **Yǔ Steps (禹步)**—the initial **Nine Steps (初九迹)**. Then reverse and return to the **Trigram Head (纲头)**, and repeat the invocation. Open as **Twelve Steps (十二迹)**, then reverse and open as **Fifteen Steps (十五迹)**. Upon completion, align the **Left and Right Garments (左右配衣)**—the diagram shows both the **Left Garment Method (左配衣法)** and the **Four Battles (斗名)**. The **Right Garment Method (右配衣法)** is also called the **Four Battles (四斗)**—referring to the alignment of left and right garments. In the **First Step Diagram of the Flowing Pearl (《流珠》上卷第一步纲图)**, all follow the pattern of one left and one right. Simply verify and apply as needed.*\n\nInvoke the **Wood Official** to **erect a house (起屋)**—this is to **rectify life (治生)**. **Felling the house (倒屋)**—this is to **rectify death (治死)**. Either method may be chosen at will. The **incantation** lies in the **middle joint of the left ring finger (左手第四指中节)**, twisting it. Or bind it with **five-colored threads (五色线)** for an extended duration.\n\n**Conjure the Venerable Laozi**, the **Primordial Origin (先天地生)**—**conjure the withered wood to regrow branches and leaves (摄枯木花叶再生)**, able to heal a person’s illness swiftly and restore equilibrium.** **Summon and bind the soul and spirit (召摄魂魄)**, ordering them to return to their bodily form. **Upright house, upright body—quickly arise and complete.** *As fast as the ritual decree.*\n\nThe **Posterity Sage (后圣君)** said: *\"When invoking the Wood Official to erect a house for the sick, there are numbers and hierarchical levels. The highest is for kings and emperors—erecting a main house and auxiliary house for **forty thousand people (四十万人)**, with **ten thousand per region (一方十万人)**. The middle is for prime ministers and high officials—**four thousand people (四千人)**, with **one thousand per region (一方一千人)**. The lowest is for the **five ranks (五品)** down to commoners—**four hundred people (四百人)**, with **one hundred per region (一方一百人)**. Together, they erect the main house and auxiliary house, fell trees and gather wood, grasp earth and clear grass—grass being the **commoner’s term for killing qi (杀炁)** or **calamity (殃)**. They raise pillars, install beams, and frame the house. At the appointed time, they visualize and complete it—house built, patient recovered.\"* **Proclaiming the decree:** *\"The Wood Official swiftly constructs the house; house completed, the patient’s fortune flourishes. Fortune born, soul and spirit return to form. Illness vanishes, blessings received—long life attained.\"* *As fast as the ritual decree.*\n\nThe **incantation for restoring the soul and returning the spirit (捻还魂入神正魄诀)** is in the **middle joint of the left thumb (左手大指中节)**, binding it with **five-colored silk (五色丝)** for **forty-nine days (二七日)**.\n\nThe **Venerable Laozi** told **Luó Zhēnrén**: *\"Luó Wénqiáng, a great minister of the **Yīn Dynasty (殷)**, was skilled in **ritual prohibitions and incantations (禁咒之术)**. He often aided people in averting disasters and healing illnesses, fulfilling his merits by the **third wǔ (三午)**. He ascended in broad daylight. This method has multiple applications: one to heal illness, two to **ward off evil (辟恶)**, three to **treat afflictions and harm (治患害)**, four to **dissolve slander (消口舌)**, five to **prohibit (禁)**, six to **translocate (移)**, seven to **defeat (败)**.* These seven methods can address both auspicious and inauspicious matters.\n\nThe rest I heard from my master’s lips, passed orally—keep it secret and do not divulge.\n\n**The Consideration and Summoning Master** expounds the method of **visualizing the roaming body (说身巡游)** and **inspecting the patient’s home (病家图法)**.\n\nThe **Venerable Laozi** told **Wénqiáng Zhēnrén**: *\"For a Daoist master to aid others as a healer, to tread and prohibit illnesses, is no simple task. They must first purify their body and calm their mind. Whether prohibiting or incanting, all serve to heal a hundred maladies—this is a great merit. This single method cures illness: the master first visualizes and enters the patient’s home, passing through the door into their chamber. Seeing the patient lying on their bed, the master invokes and summons, visualizing a **wild troop of horses (阵野马)** and **scattered soldiers (散吏兵)**, seizing clubs to drive them away, trampling them as **malevolent ghosts and thieves (祟鬼贼)**, startling them into fleeing and scattering. Again, visualize **great wild elephants (野堵大象)** and **lions (师子)** coming in one by one, entering the chamber, devouring food as **demonic spirits and wild ghosts (妖精野鬼)**, then fleeing.\"*",

It favors longevity in humans and cherishes the **vitality (生)** that nurtures life. It opposes death, for death is the end of human vitality. This deity abhors the sight of death, so the **Celestial Sovereign (太上)** commands it through talismans to protect living humans and subdue death spirits, thus safeguarding the homes of the living. It averts harm from **deceitful words (非横口舌)**, **malevolent ghosts (凶鬼)** biting at people, **spellcraft poisons (蛊毒)** blocking doors, and **non-corporeal spirits (非尸之字)**. Even **serpents (蛇)** and their venomous substances can be repelled by this method, preventing them from causing harm.*\n\n*This method is typically practiced at night, or both day and night—once daily, once nocturnally. Without interruption, if one **stores the condition in mind (存思)** for three days, the effects should manifest and the illness should abate. First, one must **step the Gāng (纲) Diagram (步)**. **Storing (存)** refers to the mental cultivation of the **Gāng Diagram (纲图)** and the **Jì (纪) Step (步)** method, as well as the **Steel Method (钢法)**. The **Venerable Sage (后圣君)** instructed **Yín Zhēnren (尹真人)**:\n*'The **Jì Diagram (蹑纪)** and **Yǔ’s Step (禹步)** require seven years of practice for their merit to take effect. It is not necessary to physically perform the steps yourself. Simply **store them in your mind (心存)** as if visualizing the **Gāng Diagram (纲图)**. If you **embody the steps (存身)** and traverse the **Jì Diagram (纪纪)**, crossing the **Steel Method (钢过)**, the effects will be achieved. If the effects are not yet manifest, you must **step the Gāng Diagram (步纲)** and **Jì Diagram (镊纪)** method. Three traversals of the **Earth Diagram (地纪)**, three repetitions of **Yǔ’s Step (禹步)** with nine traces, and three strikes on the left and right sides while coordinating with the **Heavenly Diagram (天式)**. Then, **twist the Earth’s Vitality Point (地心目)**, shout three times, and chant to **summon and subdue (摄)** the **Four Celestial Guardians (四神)**, as well as the **Earth Deities (地神)** and **Earth Axis Deities (地轴神)**, to relocate mountains, rivers, seas, and reshape their breadth and expanse—whether near or far—without difficulty.*\n\n*This method also includes **Heavenly and Earthly Ritual Coordination (天地式相应)**. With time, one can move freely in and out of the world. The **Five Grades of Verification (五等验极)** are its ultimate tests.*\n\n*The **Celestial Sovereign (太上)** further stated:\n*'Those who practice **Daoist techniques (道术)** must do so with **true sincerity (真心)**, without deceit or fraud, without greed, without anger, and without delusion. Only such individuals can **uphold and practice (行持)** this method. If one’s heart is not true, if there is delusion, anger, greed, or deceit, they are unfit to practice this method. Do not imitate the wicked. One must first purify and rectify oneself, ensuring they are worthy of this practice. Now, if you only practice the **Dao of healing and saving people (救人治病之道)**, Heaven and Earth will bestow merit upon you, and you will attain the **Dao of Ascension (仙道)** day by day.*\n\n*In recent times, there was a **Daoist adept (道士)**, **Huáng Lúzi (黄卢子)**, from **Gěyuè (葛越)**. He often practiced **qi control and prohibition techniques (炁禁之术)**, invoking the **Four Celestial Guardians (四神)** and the **Earth Deities (地神)** and **Earth Axis Deities (地轴神)** to command and subdue the **landscape (江山)**. With ease, he could **fold mountains (回山)**—meaning he could condense a thousand *lǐ* of terrain into the span of a single *lǐ* (一里之地), or expand a single *lǐ* into a thousand *lǐ* (千里江山)—without effort. He could also **shrink the earth and turn the seas (缩地转海)**.*\n\n*This method also requires **treading the Jì Diagram (蹑地纪)** for six years. Then, with prolonged breathing and **mental storage (存)**, one invokes the **Four Celestial Guardians (四神)**, the **Earth Deities (地神)**, and the **Earth Axis Deities (地轴神)**, always carrying the **talismans of the Earth Deities and Earth Axis Deities (地神地轴等箓)**. One must **tread the Jì Diagram (蹑纪)** three times, then disperse into **Yǔ’s Step (禹步)** three times, followed by three repetitions of the **Cutting Off Earthly Veins Step (绝地脉步)**. Then, one aligns with the **Heavenly Diagram (天式)**, striking three times on the left and right sides while coordinating. Next, one **twists the Earth’s Vitality Point (地心目)** and shouts three times, chanting to **summon and subdue (摄)** the **Four Celestial Guardians (四神)**, the **Earth Deities (地神)**, and the **Earth Axis Deities (地轴神)**. This enables the **transformation and relocation of mountains, rivers, and seas (移山河江海)**, altering their width and breadth—whether distant or near—without difficulty.*\n\n*This method also includes **Heavenly and Earthly Ritual Coordination (天地式相应)**. In time, one can move freely in and out of the world. The **Five Grades of Verification (五等验极)** are its ultimate tests.\n\n*The **Celestial Sovereign (太上)** further instructed:\n*'The **Daoist Master (天师)** who receives the **Venerable Sage’s command (后圣君诀)** must bind the **fourth finger of the left hand (左手第四指)** at its first joint with **five-colored silk threads (五色丝线)**, ensuring they never loosen. Within **five days and nights (五日及夜)**, the **ghost’s eyes will be blinded (鬼目盲)**, and the **human’s eyes will turn green (人目青)**. By the **tenth day (十日)**, the effects will dissipate.*\n\n*'For those who practice **Daoist techniques (道术)**, they must do so with **true sincerity (真心)**, without deceit or fraud, without greed, without anger, and without delusion. Only such individuals can **uphold and practice (行持)** this method. If one’s heart is not true and upright, if they harbor delusion, anger, greed, or deceit, they are unfit to practice this method. Do not imitate the wicked. One must first purify and rectify oneself, ensuring they are worthy of this practice. Now, if you only practice the **Dao of healing and saving people (救人治病之道)**, Heaven and Earth will bestow merit upon you, and you will attain the **Dao of Ascension (仙道)** day by day.*\n\n*'In the present age, people do not understand this. They only blame and resent the **ghosts (鬼)**. Yet the **ghosts (鬼)** cannot themselves cause such harm. They do so by **borrowing the authority of Heavenly and Earthly officials (假天地官之威)**, thus **riding on that power to create mischief (即乘威而作祟)**.*\n\n*Those who hold **Daoist official positions (仙官之位)** all possess **authority (威)**. They command **Heavenly deities (天神)** and **Earthly deities (地只)**, overseeing the **nine lands and ten thousand kingdoms (九土万国)**, as well as **community deities (社神)** and **temple deities (庙神)**. These two categories of deities—one **aiding and healing virtuous people (救治吉人)**, the other **subduing and punishing malevolent and rebellious individuals (征伐恶逆之徒)**—all act according to Heaven’s will. If you **embody the Heavenly method (以子身受天之法)** and **wear the Heavenly talismans (带天之文)**, your body becomes that of a **Heavenly official (天官)**. Then, you can execute Heaven’s commands, **upholding righteousness (执直其心取仁)** and **without favoritism or partiality (无亲无偏党之性)**, **without covetous desires (无傍偷之欲)**, and with a **lofty and distant aspiration (清高志远)**. Such individuals can **endure and generate life (久远生生)**, never retreating but always advancing in wisdom. They alone can be entrusted with this method.*\n\n*To **administer the Heavenly Law (掌行天法)**, one must **grasp the key to repentance and salvation (悔救之诀)**. This method must not be **recklessly transmitted (不可妄传)** to those unworthy, as the crime will extend to **seven generations (七代)** and bring **calamity and annihilation (殃没)** to oneself. The **Daoist Master (天师)** who receives the **Venerable Sage’s command (后圣君诀)** must observe these strictures.*」",
