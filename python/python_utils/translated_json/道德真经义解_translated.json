  "full_translation": "**Jade Explications of the Cavernous Spirit Division**\n*Exegetical Explanation of the True Scripture of Dao and Virtue*\n**Scripture Title:** *Exegetical Explanation of the True Scripture of Dao and Virtue*\n**Author:** Li Jiamou of the Song Dynasty\n**Four Scrolls**\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity* (Cavernous Spirit Division, Jade Explications Category)\n**Collated Edition:** *Essentials of the Daoist Canon*, First Category\n\n---\n\n**Scroll One**\n*Explication by the Recluse of Restful Studio*\n*Dao Scripture, Part One*\n\n**Chapter One: \"The Dao That Can Be Spoken\"**\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal name.\nNameless, it is the origin of heaven and earth;\nNamed, it is the mother of the myriad things.\nEver desireless, one observes its mystery;\nEver desiring, one observes its manifestations.\nThese two emerge together yet bear different names.\nTogether they are called the profound.\nProfound and yet more profound—\nThe gateway to all mysteries.\n\n\"Eternal\" denotes that which does not change.\nThings may transform, but the Dao does not.\nThe transformations of things shift moment by moment,\nNever pausing even for an instant.\nYet the Dao itself is without beginning or end;\nHeaven and earth may perish, but this Dao is inexhaustible.\nThis is what is called \"eternal.\"\nAs the eternal Dao, it cannot be attained through action,\nNor grasped through naming.\nIf it could be attained through action, it would not be the eternal Dao.\nIf it could be grasped through naming, it would not be the eternal name.\nBefore the inception of heaven and earth,\nThe principle of true constancy already resided in the nameless origin.\nThus, the nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth.\nOnce heaven and earth were sundered, names arose,\nAnd from these, the myriad things proliferated.\nThus, that which can be named is the mother of things.\n\nThe sage embodies the true and constant Dao,\nMoving between being and non-being.\nThe \"mystery\" is the great Dao, the non-being;\nThe \"manifestation\" is the lesser Dao, the being.\nWhen I wish to observe its mystery,\nI enter into the mystery and return to non-being.\nWhen I wish to observe its manifestation,\nI emerge with the manifestation and wander in being.\nMystery is the subtlety of manifestation;\nManifestation is the subtlety of mystery.\nBeing is emptiness;\nEmptiness is being.\nTheir root is the same, though their branches differ.\nThus, together they are called the profound.\nYet it is not only this—\nThe profound within the profound\nEnables all manifestations to be nothing but mysteries.\nThis is the gateway to all mysteries,\nFor within the subtleties of being and non-being,\nAll is refined and transformed into mystery.\n\n**Chapter Two: \"When All Under Heaven Know\"**\nWhen all under heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises.\nWhen all know goodness as goodness, not-goodness arises.\nThus, being and non-being produce each other;\nDifficult and easy complete each other;\nLong and short shape each other;\nHigh and low incline toward each other;\nSound and voice harmonize with each other;\nFront and back follow each other.\nTherefore, the sage abides in non-action,\nPractices the teaching without words,\nAllows the myriad things to arise without hindrance,\nGives life without possessing,\nActs without relying,\nAccomplishes without dwelling.\nOnly because he does not dwell\nDoes it not depart from him.\n\nThe five thousand words of *Laozi*\nAbove may penetrate the mystery,\nBelow may penetrate the manifestation.\nThrough them, one attains the Dao;\nThrough them, one governs the state;\nThrough them, one cultivates the self.\nTheir words consistently apply to these three,\nWhich is why they are subtle, mysterious, and profoundly unfathomable.\n\nThis chapter speaks of our original nature,\nWhich, before the existence of things,\nKnew neither beauty nor ugliness, neither goodness nor not-goodness.\nOnce existence was established and forms and names were distinguished,\nPeople knew beauty as beauty,\nYet did not realize that the name of ugliness arose from beauty.\nPeople knew goodness as goodness,\nYet did not realize that the name of not-goodness arose from goodness.\nFor in all things under heaven,\nNothing exists without its opposite.\nBeing and non-being produce each other;\nDifficult and easy complete each other;\nLong and short shape each other;\nHigh and low incline toward each other;\nSound and voice harmonize with each other;\nFront and back follow each other—\nWhere there is one, there cannot fail to be the other.\nThe sage, knowing this,\nMust stand before things and follow their natural course.\nEngaging in non-action,\nPracticing the teaching without words,\nNeither grasping goodness nor rejecting ugliness,\nNever clinging to one, yet never without unity,\nActing all day without acting,\nSpeaking all day without speaking—\nThus, when the myriad things arise, I arise with them.\nArising without hindrance,\nWhen the myriad things live, I live with them.\nGiving life without possessing,\nFor in acting, it is not my action but merely following things.\nThus, I act without reliance.\nWhen there is accomplishment, it is not my accomplishment but merely responding to things.\nThus, I accomplish without dwelling.\nBy not dwelling in the end but dwelling in the beginning,\nThat which I dwell in cannot be taken away,\nAnd so things cannot depart from it.\n\n**Chapter Three: \"Not Exalting the Worthy\"**\nNot exalting the worthy prevents the people from contending.\nNot prizing rare goods prevents the people from stealing.\nNot displaying what is desirable prevents the heart from confusion.\nThus, in the sage’s governance,\nHe empties their hearts,\nFills their bellies,\nWeakens their ambitions,\nStrengthens their bones,\nEver keeping the people without knowledge and without desire.\nHe ensures that the knowledgeable dare not act.\nEngaging in non-action, there is nothing left ungverned.\n\nTo be proud or boastful is to exalt the worthy.\nTo cherish or acquire is to prize rare goods.\nTo perceive or be drawn to beauty is to display what is desirable.\nSpeaking of the body alone:\nThe heart is the ruler; the ears, eyes, nose, mouth, limbs, and members are the people.\nWhat the superior loves, the inferior will exaggerate.\nIf I set pride and boasting before the people,\nThe people will each boast of their abilities.\nBoasting without end, their contention will inevitably arise.\nIf I set cherishing and acquiring before the people,\nThe people will each take what they desire.\nTaking without cease, their thievery will inevitably arise.\nIf I make desire my heart,\nCraving will know no bounds.\nWhatever appears before me, whatever moves my eyes,\nI will desire to obtain—\nAnd thus, confusion will inevitably arise.\n\nThus the sage empties the heart, weakens the will, strengthens the bones, and fills the belly.\nThe heart and will belong to the human Dao;\nthe bones and belly belong to the Heavenly Dao.\nThe sage follows Heaven and not the human;\nthe multitude follows the human and not Heaven.\nWhat is meant by \"following Heaven and not the human\"?\nThe heart is like the belly, the will like the bones.\nAs the saying goes: *\"Would that the petty man’s belly were the noble man’s heart!\"*—it would be nothing more than steadfast integrity.\nFor the belly is easily satisfied, while the heart is never satisfied.\nThe sage, abiding in Heaven, is full as the belly, firm as the bones—\nnone know how he is full, yet he is full;\nnone know how he is firm, yet he is firm.\nBeing both full and firm,\nthe heart is empty without striving for emptiness,\nthe will is weak without striving for weakness.\nThe multitude is not so:\nthey cling to the human and not to Heaven.\nThus, in contention and grasping, their hearts and wills grow strong within.\nWhen the heart is wild, craving arises;\nthe more they take, the more they lack—\nthis is the belly never filled.\nWhen the will is full, indolence follows;\nindolence leads to insufficiency—\nthis is the bones never strengthened.\nThe sage, guarding within with clarity,\nis unmoved by externals,\nthus making the people without knowledge and without desire.\nFor where there is knowledge, there is inevitably mixture;\nwhere there is thought, there is inevitably deviation—\nthis is inescapable for all things.\nThe sage knows that knowledge is not mixed, thought is not deviant.\nI can know, yet knowing that knowledge cannot be master,\nthis is called *\"the knower does not act.\"*\nWhat is known is true,\nwhat is done is not disordered.\nThus, knowledge is without knowledge,\naction is without action.\nApplying this to the state or to the self,\nthere is nothing that is not well-ordered.\n\n**Chapter 4: The Dao’s Profundity**\nThe Dao is profound and ever-flowing,\nits use never full.\nAbysmal, it seems the ancestor of the myriad things.\nBlunting its sharpness,\nuntangling its knots,\nsoftening its glare,\nmerging with the dust—\ndeep and serene, it seems to exist.\nI know not whose child it is,\nit seems prior to the Lord of Heaven.\n\nThe Dao is profoundly empty and wondrous;\npressed to grasp it, it seems unattainable.\nThus it is said: *\"its use never full.\"*\nYet the deeper its mystery, the more it is used without exhaustion.\nEach thing follows the Dao, yet the Dao never becomes a thing.\nThus it is said: *\"it seems the ancestor of the myriad things.\"*\n\nThe ancients who studied the Dao\nnever set their minds on advancement or achievement.\nTo blunt its sharpness is not to act willfully—\nthey never feared what they did not do.\nTo untangle its knots is to act without omission—\nthey never sought goodness as beauty.\nTo soften its glare is not to seek goodness—\nthey never despised evil as wrong.\nTo merge with the dust is not to reject evil—\nserene, they abided without abiding in serenity.\nThus it seems to exist.\nI know not its beginning,\nthus I know not whose child it is.\nI know not what precedes it,\nthus it seems prior to the Lord of Heaven.\n\n**Chapter 5: Heaven and Earth Are Not Benevolent**\nHeaven and Earth are not benevolent;\nthey treat the myriad things as straw dogs.\nThe sage is not benevolent;\nhe treats the people as straw dogs.\nThe space between Heaven and Earth—\nis it not like a bellows?\nEmpty yet inexhaustible,\nthe more it moves, the more it yields.\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion;\nbetter to guard the center.\n\nGreat benevolence is not partial,\nthough it may seem not to favor, its benevolence is all-pervading.\nSmall benevolence favors the near,\nthough it may seem to favor, its benevolence is not all-pervading.\nThus, Heaven and Earth do not favor each thing with partiality,\nnor love each person as themselves.\nLike straw dogs used in sacrifice,\nthey are neither used nor discarded,\nneither valued nor despised—\nthey regard things as straw dogs,\nand regard themselves as a bellows.\n\nEmpty yet inexhaustible,\nthe more it moves, the more it yields.\nThe bellows does not know it generates wind,\nnor does the wind know it arises from the bellows—\nthus the more it moves, the more inexhaustible it becomes.\nIf one insists on benevolence to favor things,\nbenevolence will not be all-pervading.\nIf one does not respond with emptiness,\nthe response will not be complete.\nNow, to seek words with words\nis already to risk exhaustion—\nhow much more to observe the myriad things with a single self?\nBetter to guard the center within,\nspeaking only when the time is right.\nI know not what is said,\nthus words fill the world without fault.\n\n**Chapter 6: The Valley Spirit Never Dies**\nThe valley spirit never dies—\nthis is called the Mysterious Female.\nThe gate of the Mysterious Female\nis called the root of Heaven and Earth.\nSubtle and enduring, it seems to exist;\nits use is never exhausted.\n\nThe spirit is concealed in the body,\nlike a valley hidden in a mountain—\nthus it is said: *\"the valley spirit.\"*\nThe valley is empty, yet its function is fullness;\nfullness arises from emptiness.\nThe valley spirit has no form,\ndwelling in the formed yet never dying—\nlike its nourishment by the Mysterious Female.\nThe *Mysterious* is Heaven, in man it is the nose.\nThe *Female* is Earth, in man it is the mouth.\nThe nose, empty, receives Heaven’s *qi*;\nthe mouth, empty, consumes Earth’s essence.\nThus, the gate of the Mysterious Female\nis the passage of essence and *qi*—\nman’s immortality lies in his root in Heaven and Earth.\nIf one knows its regulation,\nfollowing its nature,\nusing non-use,\nalways keeping it subtle and enduring like the valley’s emptiness—\nthen the spirit moves and Heaven responds,\nnothing fails to answer.\n\n**Chapter 7: Heaven and Earth Are Everlasting**\nHeaven and Earth are everlasting.\nThe reason Heaven and Earth endure so long\nis that they do not live for themselves—\nthus they can live long.\nTherefore the sage places himself last and finds himself first,\nsets himself aside and finds himself preserved.\nIs it not because he is selfless?\nThus he can fulfill his self.\n\nHeaven bestows, Earth produces—\nthe Dao of bestowing and producing lies in Heaven and Earth.\nThey never abandon the field for a day;\ntheir bestowal is unceasing,\ntheir production unfathomable.\nHeaven never loves its bestowal,\nEarth never rests its production—\nthis is called *\"not living for themselves.\"*\nBecause they do not live for themselves,\nthe myriad things rely on them to live—\nthus they can live long.\nThe sage is the same.\nKnowing this heart is unchanging and indestructible,\nvast and flowing with Heaven and Earth,\nhe finds nothing in this body to cling to.\nThe movement of this single heart\nknows no action that is not done;\nin every gesture, nothing is not good and beneficial—\nlike what he attains,\nhe takes non-self as self.\nThus, of all under Heaven who have a self, none compare to him.\n\nThis is called *\"putting oneself last yet finding oneself first, setting oneself aside yet preserving oneself.\"*\nWhat prevents people from perfecting things is their self-interest;\nI have no self-interest, thus I can perfect others' interests.\nWhen things attain their own interests,\nI attain my attainment—\nthis is called *\"mutual attainment.\"*\n\n**Chapter Eight: Supreme Virtue is Like Water**\nSupreme virtue is like water.\nWater virtuously benefits the myriad things yet does not contend,\ndwelling where the multitude abhors—\nthus it nearly approaches the Dao.\nIn dwelling, it is good at low places;\nin the heart, it is good at depth;\nin giving, it is good at humaneness;\nin speech, it is good at sincerity;\nin governance, it is good at order;\nin affairs, it is good at ability;\nin movement, it is good at timing.\nOnly by not contending does it remain without blame.\n\nSupreme virtue benefits things without choosing its place;\nwherever there are things, I follow them—\nthus its virtue is like water.\nAbove, it becomes rain and dew;\nbelow, it becomes rivers and streams.\nIt does not choose the ground to dwell in,\nnor choose things to bestow upon—\neven in filth and defilement, nothing is not encompassed.\nDwelling where the multitude abhors,\nthus it nearly approaches the Dao.\n\nThe sage’s benefiting of things is likewise.\nIn dwelling, he does not choose direction—\nthus wherever he arrives is a good place.\nThe heart does not act for itself—\nthus what it harbors is good depth.\nIn bestowal, he does not choose things—\nthus what he gives is good humaneness.\nThe mouth does not choose words—\nthus what it speaks is good sincerity.\nFollowing principle in conduct,\nthere is no action that is not upright—\nthus his uprightness is good order.\nWithout intent in affairs,\nno affair is not accomplished—\nthus his affairs are good ability.\nNever acting arbitrarily,\nevery action accords with measure—\nthus his movement is good timing.\n\nFor the multitude rushes toward what the sage abandons,\nwhile what the sage possesses, the multitude lacks—\nthey never share the same path.\nThus I have never contended with others,\nand others have no blame for me.\n\n**Chapter Nine: Holding and Filling**\nHolding and filling it is not as good as stopping.\nHoning and sharpening it cannot be long preserved.\nWhen gold and jade fill the hall, none can guard them.\nWealth and honor with arrogance\nbring one’s own calamity.\nTo retire when merit is achieved and fame is attained—\nthis is the Dao of Heaven.\n\nKnowing its fullness yet holding it\nis not as good as never having been full.\nKnowing its sharpness yet honing it\nis not as good as never having been sharp.\nTo know fullness yet hold it,\nto know sharpness yet hone it—\nthis is already not good,\nhow much worse for those who are full yet do not hold,\nsharp yet do not hone?\nFullness leading to greater greed,\nsharpness leading to greater arrogance,\ngold and jade filling the hall without knowing when to stop,\nwealth and honor with arrogance—\nunable to make things arrogant,\none first loses one’s own heart—\nthis is called *\"bringing one’s own calamity.\"*\n\nThe movement of the four seasons:\nwhen merit is achieved, one retreats—\nthe Dao of Heaven is like this,\nhow much more for humans?\n\n**Chapter Ten: Carrying the Spiritual and Embracing the One**\nIn carrying the spiritual and embracing the One,\ncan you never part from it?\nIn concentrating qi to attain softness,\ncan you be like an infant?\nIn cleansing and purifying profound vision,\ncan you be without flaw?\nIn loving the people and governing the state,\ncan you practice non-action?\nIn the opening and closing of the Heavenly Gate,\ncan you play the female?\nIn clarity and thorough understanding,\ncan you be without knowledge?\n\nGiving life and nurturing,\ngiving life yet not possessing,\nacting yet not relying,\ngrowing yet not ruling—\nthis is called *\"profound virtue.\"*\n\n*\"Carrying\"* means beginning.\n*\"Spiritual\"* means creating.\nThe *hun* is human yang.\nThe *po* is human yin.\nFrom the beginning of creation, the *po* embraces the *hun*—\ncan you make the *hun* and *po* embrace,\nunited as one and never parting?\n\nThe infant’s yang qi is not yet dispersed,\ninner harmony is soft—\nthis is not the infant’s ability,\nbut the effect of concentrating qi.\nWithout aiming to attain, it attains—\nthus concentrating qi brings harmony,\nunited as one and without admixture—\ncan you be like a child?\n\nIn transcendent profound vision,\nthere is nothing not good,\nyet if this heart is not forgotten,\nit is insufficient to speak of the Dao—\nthus can you cleanse and purify profound vision,\nmaking it without flaw?\n\nLoving the people with love,\nlove is never complete.\nGoverning the state with affairs,\nthe state is never well-governed.\nIn purity and stillness, facing the people,\nthe people will transform themselves—\nthus can you practice non-action?\n\nYang moves and opens,\nyin is still and closes—\none opening, one closing,\nfrom which transformations emerge.\nYet ceaseless movement must reach exhaustion;\nmovement followed by closing,\nguarding stillness to nurture movement—\nthus can you play the female?\n\nInwardly and outwardly clear,\nthe center thoroughly illuminated—\nthough not engaging in affairs,\none is still burdened by the dust of stillness.\nOnly by knowing the self as no-self\ncan one know that nothing is an obstacle—\nthus can you be without knowledge?\n\nThe sage gives life to things as a parent,\nnurtures them as descendants—\nyet gives life without taking as possession,\nacts without relying on merit,\ngrows without claiming mastery—\nwithout embodying profound virtue, this cannot be.\n\n**Chapter Eleven: The Thirty Spokes**\nThirty spokes share one hub—\nit is where there is nothing that the usefulness of the cart lies.\nClay is molded to make a vessel—\nit is where there is nothing that the usefulness of the vessel lies.\nDoors and windows are cut to make a room—\nit is where there is nothing that the usefulness of the room lies.\nThus, *\"having\"* is for the sake of benefit,\n*\"nothing\"* is for the sake of use.\n\nThe body is *\"having,\"*\nthe spirit is *\"nothing\"*—\nthe spirit is concealed in the body,\nusing emptiness to employ fullness.\nThus the ear, without emptiness, cannot hear;\nthe eye, without emptiness, cannot see;\nthe nose, without emptiness, cannot smell;\nthe mouth, without emptiness, cannot receive;\nthe body, without emptiness, cannot touch.\nThus benefit may lie in fullness,\nbut use lies in emptiness.\n\nLike thirty spokes forming a hub—\nwithout emptiness, the hub cannot turn.\nClay molded to make a vessel—\nwithout emptiness, the vessel cannot contain.\nDoors and windows cut to make a room—\nwithout emptiness, the room cannot be bright.\nEars, eyes, nose, and mouth gather to form the body—\nyet without emptiness, the five senses cannot function;\nwithout emptiness, the spirit cannot dwell.\nThe use of emptiness—\nhow great it is!\n\n**Chapter Twelve: The Five Colors**\nThe five colors blind the eyes,\nthe five tones deafen the ears,\nthe five flavors dull the mouth,\ngalloping and hunting madden the heart,\nrare goods hinder conduct.\nThus the sage is for the belly, not for the eyes—\ntherefore he discards that and takes this.\n\nThe eye can see colors,\nyet the eye is blinded by colors.\nThe ear can hear sounds,\nyet the ear is deafened by sounds.\nThe mouth can taste flavors,\nyet the mouth is ruined by flavors.\nGalloping in the hunt, endlessly seeking goods—\nall arise from the heart’s capacity to grasp,\nyet this very capacity brings its own loss.\n\nFor the spirit dwells within,\nwhile the ears, eyes, heart, and mouth divide its functions—\nseeing, hearing, tasting, knowing.\nIf sight does not transcend color,\nthen color seizes sight.\nIf hearing does not transcend sound,\nthen sound seizes hearing.\nIf tasting stops at flavor,\nthen flavor seizes the mouth.\nIf the heart stops at grasping,\nthen grasping seizes the heart.\n\nWhen these four are seized by things,\nthe eye is as if blind,\nthe ear as if deaf,\nthe mouth as if dulled,\nthe heart as if mad.\nHow much better to turn inward and seek,\nso that seeing is not by color,\nbut seeing itself becomes the eye;\nhearing is not by sound,\nbut hearing itself becomes the ear;\ntasting is not by flavor,\nbut tasting itself becomes the mouth;\nknowing is not by the heart,\nbut knowing itself becomes the heart.\n\nThus the sage is for the belly, not for the eyes—\nthe belly receives without grasping,\ntakes in without retaining,\neasily satisfied and free of desire,\nunlike the eyes, which are never sated,\never seeing yet ever lacking.\nThe eyes roam outward,\nthe belly rests within.\nThe sage focuses on the inner and forgets the outer,\ntherefore discarding that and taking this.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: Favor and Disgrace**\nFavor and disgrace are like alarm,\nvaluing great trouble as one’s own body.\nWhat is meant by “favor and disgrace are like alarm”?\nDisgrace is lowly—\ngaining it brings alarm,\nlosing it brings alarm,\nhence “favor and disgrace are like alarm.”\nWhat is meant by “valuing great trouble as one’s own body”?\nThe reason I have great trouble\nis that I have a body.\nIf I had no body,\nwhat trouble would I have?\n\nTherefore, one who values the world as one’s own body\nmay be entrusted with the world;\none who cherishes the world as one’s own body\nmay be relied upon with the world.\n\nWhat is meant by “favor and disgrace are like alarm”?\nThe *Doctrine of the Mean* says:\n“The noble person acts according to their station,\nwithout desiring what lies beyond it.\nIn wealth and honor, they act as one in wealth and honor;\nin poverty and lowliness, they act as one in poverty and lowliness.”\nThus the noble person finds contentment in every situation.\nFavor and disgrace are not one’s true station—\ngaining favor brings alarm,\nfearing the disgrace to come;\nlosing disgrace brings alarm,\nfearing the favor that may arrive.\nThus one fears favor as one fears disgrace,\ngains favor as one gains disgrace.\nHence it is said, “Disgrace is lowly.”\nFor one knows both come from without.\n\nWhat is meant by “valuing great trouble as one’s own body”?\n*Mencius* says:\n“A state without loyal ministers at home\nor rival states abroad will perish.”\nYet trouble arises from having a body—\nif I had no body,\nwhat trouble would there be?\nThe body cannot be without thought,\nfor without thought, great trouble arises.\nIf one must have trouble, think how to avoid it—\nthen the body will not be lost.\nOnly by valuing great trouble as one values one’s body\ncan one avoid trouble.\nNot only this—\ntherefore, one who values the world as one’s own body\nmay be entrusted with the world;\none who loves the world as one’s own body\nmay be relied upon with the world.\nFor only by treating the world’s troubles as one’s own\ncan one preserve the state.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: The Unseen**\nLook and it cannot be seen—\nthis is called *yí*.\nListen and it cannot be heard—\nthis is called *xī*.\nGrasp and it cannot be held—\nthis is called *wēi*.\nThese three cannot be further questioned,\nso they merge into one.\nAbove, it is not bright;\nbelow, it is not dark.\nEndless, unnameable,\nit returns to nothingness.\nThis is called the formless form,\nthe imageless image—\nthis is called the indistinct and vague.\nMeet it and you cannot see its beginning;\nfollow it and you cannot see its end.\nHold to the ancient Dao to master the present,\nand you may know the ancient beginning—\nthis is called the thread of the Dao.\n\nLook and it cannot be seen—\nit cannot be sought by color.\nListen and it cannot be heard—\nit cannot be grasped by sound.\nGrasp and it cannot be held—\nit cannot be sought by form.\nSince it is not confined by color, form, or shape,\nwhat is called “original clarity”\nis but a single pure brightness.\nBefore it scatters, it merges into one—\nthough it abides in brightness, it cannot be called bright.\nThus it is said, “Above, it is not bright.”\nThough it cannot be called bright,\nit also cannot be called dark.\nThus it is said, “Below, it is not dark.”\nIt has never been separate or apart,\nhence “endless, unnameable.”\nThough it returns to nothingness,\nit cannot be called nothingness.\nThus it is called the formless form,\nthe imageless image—\nthis is called the indistinct and vague.\nThe indistinct and vague,\never changing without fixed form,\nis called the constant.\nIts coming has no beginning,\nso meeting it, you cannot see its head.\nIts going has no end,\nso following it, you cannot see its rear.\nHold to the ancient Dao to master the present,\nand the present becomes like the ancient.\nFrom the present’s likeness to the ancient,\nyou may know the ancient’s likeness to the present—\nthis is called the thread of the Dao.\nThe thread of the Dao means\nno separation between past and present.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: The Skillful Practitioner**\nThe skillful practitioners of old\nwere subtle, mysterious, profound, and penetrating—\nso deep they could not be known.\nBecause they could not be known,\nI strain to describe them:\nCautious, as if crossing a winter stream;\nalert, as if wary of neighbors on all sides;\nsolemn, as if a guest;\nyielding, as if ice about to melt;\nsimple, as if uncarved wood;\nopen, as if a valley;\nopaque, as if muddy.\n\nWho can still the muddy and gradually clarify it?\nWho can stir the still and gradually bring it to life?\nThose who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness.\nOnly because they are not full\ncan they remain hidden and not newly exposed.\n\nThe subtle, mysterious, profound, and penetrating practitioner\nencounters things like one crossing a winter stream—\nnot hasty in action.\nLike one wary of neighbors on all sides—\nnot hasty in knowledge.\nSolemn as a guest—\nnot presuming to take the lead.\nYielding as ice about to melt—\nnot rigid in conduct.\n\nLoose as ice melting—\nnot presuming to be solid.\nSimple as uncarved wood—\nnot presuming to be refined.\nOpen as a valley—\nnot presuming to be full.\nOpaque as muddy water—\nnot presuming to be clear.\n\nPeople see it as turbid;\nwhen stilled and observed, it gradually clarifies.\nPeople see it as passive inaction;\nwhen stirred and tested, it gradually comes to life.\nOnly the sage can nurture clarity within turbidity,\nnurture movement within stillness—\nthus ever clear, ever moving,\nyet never full.\nThis speaks of attaining proper nurturance.\nOnly through proper nurturance\ncan the worn be made new,\nthe constant be made change.\nIf the new is taken as new,\nits completion will not last a day before exhaustion.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: Attaining the Utmost Emptiness**\nAttain the utmost emptiness,\nmaintain steadfast stillness.\nThe ten thousand things arise together,\nand I observe their return.\nThings flourish in abundance,\neach returning to its root.\nReturning to the root is called stillness;\nstillness is called returning to life.\nReturning to life is called constancy;\nknowing constancy is called illumination.\nNot knowing constancy—\nreckless action brings misfortune.\nKnowing constancy brings capacity;\ncapacity brings impartiality,\nimpartiality brings kingship,\nkingship brings heaven,\nheaven brings the Dao,\nthe Dao brings enduringness—\nthroughout life, no peril.\n\nEmptiness is the Dao’s utmost;\nstillness is the Dao’s beginning.\nThus, in stillness we speak of maintaining,\nin emptiness we speak of attaining the utmost.\nThis means that those who study the Dao\nsteadfastly maintain stillness as their foundation,\nattain the utmost emptiness as their completion.\nWhen the ten thousand things arise together,\nI do not act with them,\nbut calmly observe their return.\nThis \"return\" means\nexhausting principle and fulfilling nature to reach life.\nAll people rely on the four great elements to form their bodies—\nearth’s solidity, water’s moisture,\nwind’s movement, fire’s warmth—\ncombining to become the self.\nWhile they flourish in abundance,\nthey rush about with the four great elements,\nchanging with things,\nunaware of their return.\nWhen wind and fire depart,\nearth and water gradually decay—\nthen where does this awareness reside?\nOnly then do they realize\nthat when external conditions scatter,\nawareness returns to the self.\nThe mind is the root of the body.\nThrough deluded thoughts,\nit nurtures guest-wisdom,\ngiving rise to dust and toil,\nunable to still itself.\nWhen deluded thoughts are removed,\nguest-wisdom naturally ceases.\nThe mind’s essence is originally serene—\nthis is called returning to the root.\nReturning to the root is called stillness;\nstillness is called returning to life.\nLife is one’s heaven.\nHaving recognized one’s heaven,\nit is unchanging and unaltered.\nKnowing its unchanging nature\nis called constancy.\nThe reason people act recklessly\nis that guest-wisdom flows and turns,\nunaware that their own minds flow and turn without cease,\ngiving rise to calamity.\nIf, with the originally still, primal illumination,\none illuminates guest-wisdom,\nnot grasping its flow and turning,\nand recognizes its constancy—\nthis is called illumination.\nInternally embodying utmost constancy\nis like empty space, not rejecting any phenomena.\nThus, it has capacity.\nThings naturally find capacity,\nneither rejecting nor grasping.\nThus, it is impartial;\nimpartiality is kingship,\nkingship is heaven,\nheaven is the Dao,\nthe Dao is enduring—\nthe more enduring, the more revered,\nthe greater, the more radiant.\nThus, throughout life, no peril.\nFrom returning to the root to returning to life,\nonly those who maintain stillness can perceive it.\nFrom capacity to enduringness,\nonly those who attain utmost emptiness can achieve it.\nThis is why this chapter speaks of it first.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: The Highest**\nThe highest—\nthose below merely know of its existence.\nNext, they draw near and praise it.\nNext, they fear it.\nNext, they revile it.\nWhere trust is insufficient,\nthere is distrust.\nThus, the noble one values speech,\nyet appears hesitant.\nWhen deeds are accomplished and affairs settled,\nthe hundred clans all say, \"We are naturally so.\"\n\nThe highest virtue—\nthose below know of its existence,\nyet cannot comprehend it.\nNext, they draw near and praise it—\nthen they comprehend it.\nWhen nearness and praise are insufficient,\nthey proceed to fear it.\nWhen fear is insufficient,\nthey proceed to revile it.\nThus, not drawing near leads to fear,\nnot fearing leads to revilement—\nthis is the natural course.\nThat those below do not trust their superiors\nis not necessarily their fault.\nIt arises from insufficient trust above,\ncausing doubt below—\nno wonder in this.\nThe sage’s self-trust is steadfast,\nyet they appear hesitant in speech.\nWhen affairs are accomplished and deeds established,\nthe hundred clans cannot know how they achieved it—\neven if they wished to deny its existence, they could not.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: The Decline of the Great Dao**\nWhen the great Dao declines,\nthere is benevolence and righteousness.\nWhen wisdom and cleverness emerge,\nthere is great falsity.\nWhen the six relations are not harmonious,\nthere is filial piety and kindness.\nWhen the state is in chaos,\nthere are loyal ministers.\nWhen the Dao scatters, it descends and gives rise to wrongs;\nwhen falsity prevails, it reverses and honors the Dao.\nDescending is the Dao’s subtlety,\nwhile reversal is the extremity of decline.\nWhen the Dao has not yet scattered,\nbenevolence and righteousness lie hidden within it,\nindistinguishable and uncountable.\nWhen it becomes warmly benevolent,\npeople embrace its warmth as benevolence;\nwhen it becomes rigidly righteous,\npeople embrace its rigidity as righteousness.\nIf the great Dao were practiced to govern all under heaven,\nwhat need would there be for benevolence and righteousness to advance before it?\nUnfortunately, there are those with petty wisdom and cleverness\nwho meticulously practice righteousness—\nthen falsity arises from this,\nand disorder begins.\nThis is called descending and giving rise to wrongs.\nIn its later stages,\nwhen human falsity abounds,\nthere is nothing that is not wrong.\nAmidst the multitude of wrongs,\nthose who slightly differ from them\nare then honored.\nThus, when the six relations are not harmonious,\nonly then do we know of kindness and filial piety;\nwhen the state is in chaos,\nonly then do we know of loyal ministers—\nthis is called reversing and honoring the Dao.\nWhen the Dao scatters, we see its semblance and forget its wholeness;\nwhen it declines, it is utterly lost,\nand we honor its semblance—\nthis is why it descends further and further.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: Abandoning Sagacity and Discarding Wisdom**\nAbandon sagacity, discard wisdom—\nthe people benefit a hundredfold.\nAbandon benevolence, discard righteousness—\nthe people return to filial piety and kindness.\nAbandon skill, discard profit—\nthere are no thieves or robbers.\nThese three, as adornments, are insufficient.\nThus, let them have something to belong to:\nmanifest plainness, embrace simplicity,\nreduce self-interest, diminish desires.\n\nThe sage does not regard himself as sagacious, the wise does not regard himself as wise—if sagacity and wisdom could be abandoned, they would not be true sagacity or wisdom. The benevolent does not regard himself as benevolent, the righteous does not regard himself as righteous—if benevolence and righteousness could be abandoned, they would not be true benevolence or righteousness. Great skill does not display its skill, great profit does not display its profit—if skill and profit could be abandoned, they would not be true skill or profit.\n\nThe sage employs their substance, not their adornments; thus, what appears externally has no fixed form. The multitude steals their semblance, disrupting the true. Therefore, what appears externally must have something to belong to. That which has no fixed form benefits things, yet things do not perceive it; that which has something to belong to merely serves to disorder the world.\n\nThe sage detests falsehood for its power to disrupt the true, and so seeks to sever its root to remedy the ills of its branches. Thus, the people of the world no longer harbor minds of profit, stealing the conduct of sagacity and wisdom, feigning benevolence and righteousness while forsaking the substance of filial piety and kindness, or employing thievery while abandoning the convenience of skill and profit.\n\nOnly by placing plainness and simplicity before the people do they, seeing this plainness and simplicity, dare not deceive others with adornments. By not displaying private desires before the people, they, seeing this reduction of self-interest and desires, dare not deceive themselves with adornments.\n\n*Commentary on the Dao and Its Virtue,

Learning Brings No Sorrow\"**\n\nAbandoning learning brings no sorrow.\nBetween \"yes\" and \"ah,\" how great is the distance?\nBetween good and evil, what is the difference?\nWhat others fear, one cannot but fear—\nhow vast and boundless it remains!\n\nThe multitude bustles and rejoices,\nas if feasting at a grand sacrifice,\nas if ascending a springtime terrace.\nI alone remain unmoved, without sign,\nlike an infant who has not yet learned to smile.\nAdrift, as if with no place to return.\nThe multitude all have more than enough,\nI alone seem bereft.\nWhat a fool’s heart I possess—so simple and pure!\n\nThe common folk shine bright,\nI alone appear dim.\nThe common folk are sharp and discerning,\nI alone am dull and obscure.\nVast as the sea, drifting without cease,\nas if nowhere to rest.\nThe multitude all have their uses,\nI alone am stubborn and coarse.\nI alone differ from others,\nyet I value feeding from the Mother.\n\nIf learning does not reach nothingness,\nwhat is learned is not true learning.\nThe Dao takes non-attainment as attainment;\nlearning takes non-learning as learning.\nIf the Dao could be attained,\nit would be mere benevolence and righteousness.\nIf learning could be learned,\nit would be mere names and calculations.\nThus the sage takes non-attainment as attaining the Dao,\nand non-learning as true learning.\nHence it is said: \"Abandoning learning brings no sorrow.\"\nIf one has not yet reached non-learning,\nthen the world’s learning is endless—\ngrasping one thing, losing another,\ngaining here, losing there,\none must rejoice in gain and sorrow in loss,\nnever at rest.\n\nThe root of the Dao,\nviewed from its origin,\nhas never differed.\nIf one does not grasp the root but seeks to equal the branches,\nthe branches will surely diverge greatly.\n\"Yea\" is reverent, \"ah\" is careless—\nyet between \"yea\" and \"ah,\"\nhow great is the distance?\nBut when it becomes reverence or carelessness,\nthe distance grows vast.\nFacing principle is good, turning from it is evil—\nyet between facing and turning,\nhow great is the difference?\nBut when it becomes good or evil,\nthe distance grows vast.\nThe sage observes beginnings,\nknowing their roots are the same,\nthus turning carelessness into reverence,\nevil into good,\nin but a moment.\nIf one knows that \"yea\" and \"ah,\" good and evil,\nshare the same root,\nthen attaining true learning is not difficult.\nYet when the sage emerges to respond to the world,\nhow can he easily change what the age desires\nto follow his own desires,\nor make the world’s views conform to his own?\n\nWhat others delight in, I too delight in;\nwhat others fear, I too fear.\nBut what sets me apart from the multitude\nis that they indulge in boundless joy,\nrejoicing as if ascending a spring terrace,\nfeasting as if at a grand sacrifice,\ntheir brightness shining forth,\nclaiming none surpass them,\ntheir wisdom sharp and clear,\nclaiming none exceed them.\nTruly, they believe their joy is joy,\ntheir beauty is beauty,\ntheir brightness is brightness,\ntheir wisdom is wisdom—\nblind to their true nature, knowing only what is real.\nThus their minds see nothing beyond the self.\n\nThe sage’s mind wanders in the Dao,\nand his response to things is not real.\nThus he remains unmoved, without sign,\nlike an infant who has not yet learned to smile,\nadrift, as if with no place to return,\nvast as the sea, drifting without cease.\nThe multitude all have more than enough,\nI alone seem bereft.\nThe multitude all have their uses,\nI alone am stubborn and coarse.\nIs this truly the heart of a fool?\nNo—what sets me apart from the multitude\nis that I recognize the root and reach the origin,\nnot flowing into the branches.\nThis is called \"valuing feeding from the Mother.\"\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One: \"The Vast Virtue’s Appearance\"**\n\nThe vast virtue’s appearance follows only the Dao.\nThe Dao as a thing is only vague and indistinct.\nIndistinct, yet within it there are images.\nVague, yet within it there are things.\nDark and deep, yet within it there is essence.\nIts essence is utterly real,\nwithin it there is sincerity.\nFrom ancient times to the present,\nits name does not fade,\nthrough which we observe the origins of all things.\nHow do I know the origins of all things?\nBy this.\n\n\"Vast\" means great.\nThe greatest virtue’s appearance is also great.\nThe Dao has never had an appearance,\nyet the vast virtue’s appearance depends on the Dao.\nThus it arises with the Dao’s arising—I know not its arising;\nit ceases with the Dao’s ceasing—I know not its ceasing.\nThe Dao as a thing is vague, indistinct, dark, and deep,\nyet within its vagueness there are images,\nwithin its indistinctness there are things,\nwithin its darkness and depth there is essence—\nthus from nothing, nothing is not present.\nWhat is present within presence,\nthe multitude take as real, not knowing that what is present has no true substance,\nand that presence reverts to absence.\nWhat is present within absence,\npeople do not know,\nnot realizing that absence reverts to presence.\nFor what is present within presence\nis the coarse aspect of presence.\nOnly what is present within absence\nis the true aspect of presence.\nOnly when it is true and not false\ndoes it neither persist through presence\nnor vanish through absence.\nThis is called \"sincerity.\"\nFrom ancient times to the present,\nunchanging and unaltered,\nits essence does not fade.\nThus the sage can observe the beginnings of all things\nand know why all things are as they are,\nfor he embodies perfect nothingness,\nand so can observe all things.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: \"Bending Brings Wholeness\"**\n\nBend and you will be whole,\ntwist and you will be straight,\nhollow and you will be full,\nworn and you will be renewed,\nhave little and you will gain,\nhave much and you will be confused.\nThus the sage embraces the One and becomes the world’s model.\nNot seeing himself, he is enlightened;\nnot asserting himself, he is distinguished;\nnot boasting, he achieves merit;\nnot exalting himself, he endures.\nIt is only because he does not contend\nthat no one in the world can contend with him.\nIs the saying \"Bend and you will be whole\" empty words?\nTruly, wholeness returns to him.\n\nThings cannot remain forever bent,\nthus bending brings wholeness.\nThings cannot remain forever twisted,\nthus twisting brings straightness.\nHollow and they must be filled,\nworn and they must be renewed,\nhaving little makes gaining easy,\nhaving much makes confusion easy—\nthis is the ultimate principle of fullness and emptiness.\n\nThe ancient sages were able to serve as the root of all things because they embraced the One.\nTo embrace the One is to always align with the Dao, thus they do not assert themselves, but follow others’ perceptions;\nthey do not insist on their own correctness, but follow the truth in things;\nthey do not claim credit for their achievements, but let others recognize them;\nthey do not boast of their virtues, but let others acknowledge them.\nOnly by standing alone without contention do they transcend all things,\nand thus no one in the world can contend with them.\n\nThe sage follows the natural order in action—\nwater cannot fail to be whole,\nyet it remains whole by yielding to curves.\nIts wholeness is supreme.\nThis is called *truly* returning to wholeness.\n\n**Chapter 23: *Hixian Ziran* (The Rare and Natural)**\nRare speech is natural.\nA gusting wind does not last a morning,\na sudden rain does not last a day.\nWho makes it so?\nThe heavens and the earth.\nEven the heavens and the earth cannot endure long,\nhow much less can mortals?\n\nThus, those who follow the Dao:\nthose aligned with the Dao are one with the Dao,\nthose aligned with virtue are one with virtue,\nthose aligned with loss are one with loss.\nThose aligned with the Dao find the Dao rejoices in them;\nthose aligned with virtue find virtue rejoices in them;\nthose aligned with loss find loss rejoices in them.\nIf trust is insufficient, there will be distrust.\nOnly when the time is right should one speak,\nso that people do not perceive the speech.\nThis is called *rare speech, natural*.\n\nIf forced to speak, it is like gusting winds and sudden rains—\nthough it may prevail for a moment,\nit will inevitably falter.\nEven with the force of heaven and earth,\nif they do not act according to their nature,\ntheir fleeting, trembling motion cannot endure,\nhow much less can mortals?\n\nThus, those who follow the Dao never fixate on gain or loss.\nWithin them, it is naturally so—\nthey know that fundamentally, there is no gain or loss.\nWithout gain or loss, yet following the world’s gains and losses,\nsometimes gaining, sometimes losing,\nthey trust in what arises,\nand their hearts remain unburdened.\nThus, being one with the Dao is acceptable,\nbeing one with virtue is acceptable,\nbeing one with loss is acceptable.\nThose one with the Dao rejoice in their Dao,\nthose one with virtue rejoice in their virtue,\nthose one with loss rejoice in their loss—\ngain and loss alike, I do not know them.\nThis is why inner sincerity brings self-trust.\nIf trust is lacking, thoughts of gain and loss will swirl within,\nwith gains and losses alternating,\ndoubting oneself before others can trust you.\n\n**Chapter 24: *Zhi Zhe Bu Li* (The Lame Do Not Stand)**\nThe crooked do not stand,\nthe straddling do not walk.\nThose who assert themselves are not enlightened,\nthose who insist on their own correctness are not distinguished,\nthose who boast of their achievements have no merit,\nthose who exalt their virtues do not endure.\nIn the Dao, these are called *excessive food, superfluous actions*—\npeople may detest them,\nso those who follow the Dao do not dwell there.\n\nStone stands without feet,\nwind moves without feet—\nthis is because those who stand do not know they stand,\nthose who walk do not know they walk.\nFeet not reaching the ground are called *lame*,\nfeet overstepping in walking are called *straddling*.\nTo stand lame is to stand briefly,\nto walk straddling is to walk without endurance.\n\nAncient students of the Dao must be whole in heaven.\nWhen they respond to things, they do not deliberate—\nlike the hands, feet, ears, and eyes responding instinctively to the heart,\nwithout being commanded.\nIf hands, feet, ears, and eyes only act after thought,\nthen in every movement, one does not know what to do.\n\nThus, those who assert themselves are not enlightened,\nthose who insist on their own correctness are not distinguished,\nthose who boast of their achievements have no merit,\nthose who exalt their virtues do not endure—\nthis is because they have a self-centered mind.\nTo study the Dao while harboring a self-centered mind\nis to indulge in *excessive food, superfluous actions*.\n\nFood is for satisfying hunger.\nAction is for serving purpose.\nAfter hunger is sated, yet piles of meat and grain remain,\none fears not taking them away.\nActions that do not serve purpose—\neven if one has Zhongzi’s frugality or Weisheng’s faithfulness,\nthey may still be burdensome.\nThus, *excessive food and superfluous actions*—\nthese two things people may detest.\nThose who follow the Dao act according to their nature,\nso their food is not excessive,\ntheir actions are not superfluous.\n\n**Chapter 25: *Youwu Huncheng* (The Indistinct and Complete)**\nThere is a thing indistinct and complete,\nborn before heaven and earth.\nSilent and void,\nit stands alone yet does not change,\ncirculates endlessly yet never perishes.\nIt can be the mother of all things under heaven.\nI do not know its name—\nI call it the Dao.\nIf I must name it, I call it *Great*.\nGreat is called *Passing*,\nPassing is called *Distant*,\nDistant is called *Returning*.\nThus, the Dao is great,\nheaven is great,\nearth is great,\nand the king is great.\nWithin the realm, there are four greats,\nand the king occupies one of them.\n\nHumans model themselves after earth,\nearth models itself after heaven,\nheaven models itself after the Dao,\nthe Dao models itself after naturalness.\n\nTo call it *a thing* is beyond naming,\nto call it *indistinct and complete* is beyond cultivation.\nIt was born before heaven and earth,\nits beginning unseen.\nSince its beginning is unseen,\nits end is unknown.\nWithout beginning or end,\nit stands alone yet does not change.\nThough it stands alone, it never truly stands alone—\nit circulates through all things,\nentering everywhere without peril.\nAll things under heaven arise from it.\nEndlessly generating, it can be the mother of all things.\n\nYet to call it *standing alone* is not standing alone,\nto call it *circulating* is not circulating,\nto call it *mother of all things* is not mothering all things.\nI do not know its name—\nI call it the Dao,\nand if forced, I name it *Great*.\nThough called *Great*, its greatness is unseen,\nyet it transforms—thus it is called *Passing*.\nThough called *Passing*, it never truly departs,\nreaching everywhere—thus it is called *Distant*.\nThough called *Distant*, in a single thought,\nit possesses all things—thus it is called *Returning*.\nJust as it is great yet able to pass,\ndistant yet able to return,\nit is neither great nor small,\nneither distant nor near—\nall beyond naming.\nThis is called the Dao.\n\nWhen the Dao descends and gives birth to things,\nheaven and earth are divided,\nand within the realm, the four greats exist.\nFrom the perspective of the world,\nthe king’s greatness does not compare to heaven and earth’s greatness,\nand heaven and earth’s greatness does not compare to the Dao’s greatness.\n\nThis is called the *Four Great*:\nThe king occupies one of them,\nthus he is matched to the Dao—\nas if there were no difficulty.\n\nThough a single man’s body\nmay regulate the emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure,\nand yet still govern heaven and earth,\nnurture all things—\nhow much more so for the king?\n\nIf he can turn to the *relative laws*,\nman follows earth,\nearth follows heaven,\nheaven follows the Dao,\nthen the king’s matching to the Dao—\nwhat difficulty could there be?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: *Heavy as the Root of Light***\n\n*Heavy* is the root of *light*,\n*stillness* is the sovereign of *restlessness*.\n\nThus the sage always says, *\"I move,\"*\nyet never leaves his *baggage*—\nhis *heavy* foundation.\n\nThough there are palaces of splendor,\nhe rests with detached ease—\nhow could a ruler of *ten thousand chariots*\nlightly bear the weight of the world?\n\n*Lightness* loses his ministers,\n*restlessness* loses his sovereignty.\n*Lightness* must return to *heavy*,\n*restlessness* must return to *stillness*.\n\nThus, *heavy* is the root of *light*,\n*stillness* is the sovereign of *restlessness*.\nThe sage always says, *\"I move,\"*\nyet never leaves his *baggage*—\nreaching everywhere,\nyet never departing from his root.\n\nThough there are palaces of splendor,\nhe rests with detached ease—\ndoing all things,\nyet ever without doing.\n\nHow could a ruler of *ten thousand chariots*\nfail to measure his own weight,\nand yet only drive himself\nthrough the world’s trivialities?\nIf he entangles himself in trifles,\nthen a single thing may enslave him—\nhow could he then rule the world?\n\nThough both *lightness* and *restlessness* may bring illness,\n*restlessness*’s harm is far greater than *lightness*.\nFor *lightness* enslaves the shallow heart,\nwhile *restlessness* enslaves the deep heart.\nThe loss from *lightness* is only what he neglects,\nbut the loss from *restlessness* disturbs the sovereign within,\nforfeiting the completeness of *stillness*.\n\nThus, *lightness* loses his ministers,\n*restlessness* loses his sovereignty.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: *The Virtuous Walk Leaves No Trace***\n\nThe virtuous walk leaves no *tracks*,\nthe virtuous speech no *flaws*,\nthe virtuous plan no need for *calculations*,\nthe virtuous closure no *locks* yet cannot be opened,\nthe virtuous binding no *ropes* yet cannot be undone.\n\nThus the sage always excels in saving others,\nand so never abandons anyone;\nalways excels in saving things,\nand so never abandons anything.\nThis is called *inheriting clarity*.\n\nThe good man is the teacher of the ungood,\nthe ungood man is the foundation of the good.\nIf one does not honor his teacher,\ndoes not cherish his foundation,\neven with great wisdom, he remains in *delusion*.\nThis is called *the essential mystery*.\n\nThe walk has never been without *tracks*,\nspeech has never been without *flaws*,\nplanning has never been without *non-calculations*,\nclosure has never been without *non-locks*,\nbinding has never been without *non-ropes*.\n\nOnly those who attain the Dao\nwalk without leaving *tracks*,\nspeak without using the mouth,\nplan without using the heart,\nclose without *locks* yet cannot be opened,\nbind without *ropes* yet cannot be undone.\nFor their essence is *constant*,\nand their skill lies in *employing constant*—\nthus they excel in all things.\n\n*Constant* is the Dao of all people,\nof all things—\nonce called *constant*,\nit neither increases with people,\nnor decreases with things.\n\nThough people and things all equally possess *constant*,\nif they lose their *true constant*,\nthe sage always uses *true constant* to save them.\nUsing *true constant* to save people,\npeople abandon no one.\nUsing *true constant* to save things,\nthings abandon no one.\nYet how could the sage do this?\nIt is because people and things all possess this clarity.\nThe sage returns to them their *original clarity*,\nthus it is said: *This is called inheriting clarity.*\n\nAs for *inheriting clarity*,\nit is equalized in one.\nOnly man has neither goodness nor ungoodness,\nthus the good man is the teacher of the ungood—\nmeaning the ungood can become good.\nThe ungood is the foundation of the good—\nmeaning the ungood’s nature is the same as the good’s.\nIf one does not honor his teacher\nand does not learn from the good,\ndoes not cherish his foundation\nyet willingly becomes evil,\neven with much wisdom, his roots are ever more in *delusion*.\nReturning to the origin, restoring the root—\nthis is called *the essential mystery.*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight: *Knowing Its Heroic***\n\nKnow its *heroic*,\nhold to its *receptive*—\nand you become the *valley* of the world.\n\nAs the *valley* of the world,\nyour *constant virtue* never departs,\nreturning to the state of *infant simplicity*.\n\nKnow its *white*,\nhold to its *black*—\nand you become the *model* of the world.\n\nAs the *model* of the world,\nyour *constant virtue* never errs,\nreturning to the *boundless*.\n\nKnow its *glory*,\nhold to its *humiliation*—\nand you become the *valley* of the world.\n\nAs the *valley* of the world,\nyour *constant virtue* is complete,\nreturning to the *uncarved*.\n\nThe *uncarved* scatters and becomes *vessels*;\nthe sage employs them as *officials and leaders*.\nThus the great *framework* is not severed.\n\nThe *heroic* moves and acts,\nthe *receptive* remains still.\nMovement must return to stillness,\nthe *heroic* must return to the *receptive*.\nThus it becomes the *valley* of the world.\n\nThe *white* desires knowledge,\nthe *black* desires non-knowledge—\nknowledge is honored when non-knowledge is cherished,\nand knowing *white* is wise when holding to *black*.\nThus it becomes the *model* of the world.\n\n*Glory* is what I bestow upon others,\n*humiliation* is what others bestow upon me—\nif I bestow *glory* and others can accept it,\nthen my benefit lies in others.\nIf others bestow *humiliation* and I can accept it,\nthen my benefit lies in myself.\nThus it becomes the *valley* of the world.\n\nYet the Dao’s *constant*—\ndoes it truly have what is called *heroic* and *receptive*,\n*white* and *black*,\n*glory* and *humiliation*?\nThose who say *\"know\"* and *\"hold\"*—\nthese are not *constant virtue*.\n\nWhen *constant virtue* scatters and becomes *virtue*,\nand one governs oneself with *virtue*,\nif one employs its *heroic*,\nemploys its *white*,\nemploys its *glory*,\nthen one loses *constant virtue*.\n\nIf one employs its *receptive*,\n*constant virtue* never departs,\nreturning to *infant simplicity*.\nIf one employs its *black*,\n*constant virtue* never errs,\nreturning to the *boundless*.\nIf one employs its *humiliation*,\n*constant virtue* is complete,\nreturning to the *uncarved*.\n\nThe so-called *infant simplicity*,\n*boundless*,\nand *uncarved*—\nall are *true constant*.\n\nThus *true constant* cannot be known,\ncannot be held—\nto make it knowable and holdable,\none must return it to *constant*,\nand only then does it become the Dao.\n\nWhen the *uncarved* scatters to become *vessels*,\nthe sage governs *vessels* with the Dao,\nyet still does not lose the Dao,\nthus he employs them as *officials and leaders*.\n*Officials and leaders*—\nto oversee the world as one oversees *officials and leaders*,\nnot as one governs a family in private.\n\n「Thus, the sage governs without favoritism,\nleads without domination—\nthis is the great principle of not overreaching.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: Taking the World by the Dao**\nIf one seeks to take the world and act upon it,\nI see that it is not inevitable.\nThe world is a sacred vessel,\nunable to be forced.\n\nForcing it leads to its ruin,\ngrasping it causes its loss.\nAll things either move on their own or follow,\neither exhale warmth or inhale cold,\neither grow strong or wither weak,\neither bear weight or collapse.\nThus the sage avoids excess, avoids extravagance, avoids arrogance.\n\nThe sage embodies the Dao as his nature,\nyet only under necessity does he cherish form in the realm between heaven and earth.\nSince the world cannot be governed without the sage,\nhe must take it under necessity.\nBut the sage regards this body as a lodging,\nand the world as a lodging for his purpose—\na lodging would never force what it lacks,\nlest it lose the true Dao of *constant virtue*.\n\nThose who do not know the Dao regard the world as a concrete possession,\nand when they assume lordship over it,\nthey wield it as a means to bend others,\nto seize things,\nyet they do not realize that their very actions\nwill instead lead to its ruin,\nand their very grasping\nwill instead cause its loss.\n\nIndeed, things in the world\neither move on their own or must be followed,\neither exhale warmth when breathed upon or inhale cold when blown,\neither grow strong and robust or wither and decay,\neither bear weight when entrusted or collapse when overburdened.\nThe non-uniformity of things is their natural condition.\nIf one insists on forcing them or seizing them,\nmaking the self-moving follow,\nthe exhaling inhale cold,\nthe strong wither weak,\nand the bearing collapse—\nthen even heaven would find it impossible,\nhow much more so humanity?\n\nThe sage follows their natural course,\nknowing their inherent limitations.\nSome things cannot be altered,\nbut he removes their excesses,\ntheir extravagances,\ntheir arrogances,\nso that those which can move or exhale warmth,\ncan grow strong or bear weight,\ndo not overreach—\nwhile those which must follow or inhale cold,\nwither weak or collapse,\ndo not fall short.\nThis is called: *with my nature, I accord to theirs*.\n\n**Chapter Thirty: Aiding the Ruler with the Dao**\nTo aid a ruler with the Dao,\none does not use force to subdue the world,\nand one’s actions are naturally self-reverting.\n\nWhere the army encamps,\nthorns and brambles grow.\nAfter great battles,\nthere must be years of hardship.\nThe virtuous act decisively,\nyet do not dare to force victory.\n\nDecisive yet not boastful,\ndecisive yet not arrogant,\ndecisive yet not proud,\ndecisive only when unavoidable,\ndecisive yet not forcing—\nthis is the Dao.\nViolating the Dao brings early ruin.\n\nHe who kills another’s father,\nothers will kill his father.\nHe who kills another’s elder brother,\nothers will kill his elder brother.\nThis is called *self-reverting*.\n\nThe harm of losing in war\nis not easily measured by one or two.\nEven if one wins by chance,\nthe killing energy’s repercussions\ncannot be made to grow by earth,\ncannot be made to harmonize by heaven.\nThus thorns and brambles grow where battles are waged,\nand famine arises after military campaigns.\nHence, the harm of losing can be known.\n\nThus the virtuous warrior,\nacting only when unavoidable,\nachieves decisive victory in one battle,\nyet does not use it to force further triumphs.\nDecisive victory is fleeting.\nWithin, he holds the heart of *unavoidable necessity*,\nwithout, he wages a single decisive battle—\nthus he never boasts,\nnever grows proud,\nnever arrogates,\nnever forces.\nAll this stems from acting only when unavoidable.\n\nIf one acts when it is avoidable yet does not cease,\nthe army grows old and its energy decays—\nlike a man in his prime who must grow old,\nthis is violating the Dao.\nViolating the Dao brings early death.\nEven if a man does not violate the Dao,\nhe still dies before his time;\nhow much more so when the army truly grows old?\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One: On Fine Arms**\nFine arms are an inauspicious instrument;\nthings naturally abhor them,\nso those who follow the Dao do not wield them.\n\nThe gentleman values the left in dwelling,\nvalues the right in wielding arms.\nArms are an inauspicious instrument,\nnot the instrument of the gentleman,\nyet they are used only when unavoidable.\nCalmness and simplicity are supreme,\nvictory without delight—\nyet those who delight in victory\nare those who delight in killing.\n\nHe who delights in killing\ncannot achieve his desires in the world.\nAuspicious matters favor the left,\ninauspicious matters favor the right.\nThe Left General is stationed on the left,\nthe Right General on the right—\nthis is said with funeral rites in mind.\n\nThe multitude of those killed\nshould be mourned with sorrowful tears,\nvictory in battle should be treated with funeral rites.\nArms cannot be fine and yet fine,\njust as a man cannot be killed and yet killed.\nThus, one who does not delight in killing\ncan then speak of arms.\n\nSunzi and Wuqi’s theories on arms\nexamine empty and full,\ndiscern irregular and regular—\ntheir words are meticulous.\nYet the roots of empty and full,\nirregular and regular,\nSunzi and Wuqi may not have known.\n\nThe *Old Master* says: *Calmness and simplicity are supreme,\nvictory without delight.*\nTo speak of arms with calmness and simplicity,\ntruly seems unlike,\nyet without calmness and simplicity there is no stillness—\nstillness is the root of victory.\nWithout stillness, there is agitation—\nagitation is the foundation of defeat.\n\nWhen Liang Xiang asked Mencius:\n*“How will the world ever be settled?”*\nMencius replied:\n*“It is settled by one.”*\nLiang Xiang asked:\n*“Who can settle it by one?”*\nMencius replied:\n*“He who does not delight in killing can settle it by one.”*\nPity that he lacked the wisdom to know this.\n\nIf one were truly not to delight in killing,\nhe could settle the world—\nthere would be nothing difficult.\nFrom ancient times to now,\nthose who do not delight in killing must rise,\nthose who delight in killing must fall.\nThose who delight in killing and yet temporarily succeed\nhave already perished;\nthere has never been one who delights in killing\nand yet endures for many years.\n\nThus the gentleman,\nwhen victorious in war,\ntreats it with funeral rites.\nAn inauspicious instrument,\nthose who follow the Dao do not wield it.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two: The Dao is Always Nameless**\nThe Dao is always nameless.\nThough crude, it is small,\nyet the world dares not submit to it.\nIf lords and kings could preserve it,\nall things would voluntarily come as guests.\n\nHeaven and earth unite,\nand sweet dew descends.\nNo one commands it,\nyet it is evenly distributed.\nWhen governance first began,\nnames were established.\nOnce names were established,\npeople knew them.\nThey knew them,\nyet did not begin with them.\n\nThe Dao in the world\nis like rivers and valleys in relation to the ocean.\n»\n\n「This chapter speaks of the Dao and instruments in a cyclical interplay of light and weight.\nThe Dao is always nameless—\nthough unseen, even the lowliest man may grasp it.\nCrude though it be, small though it seem,\nthe world dares not treat it as a subject;\nknowing its worth, none dare exceed it.\nThough lords and kings are great,\nif they cannot preserve it,\nall things will not come as guests.\nFor it is this preservation that invites them,\nnot their own grandeur.\n\nCompare it to heaven and earth setting their positions—\nthough high and low differ,\nwhen perfectly united, sweet dew descends.\nNo one commands it,\nyet all is evenly distributed.\nHeaven and earth never cease to harmonize,\nand thus the distribution is natural.\nFrom this, we see:\nThe Dao though small, must not be slighted;\nlords and kings though great, must not be revered;\nheaven and earth though divided, are not estranged.\nThough the Dao disperses into all things,\neach thing has its name,\nyet heaven never abandons them.\nIt is because heaven never abandons them\nthat all things stand between heaven and earth\nwithout perishing—\nfor heaven is their source.\nThus, things do not diminish the Dao by dispersing,\nnor does the Dao scatter by giving rise to things.\nCompare it to rivers and valleys becoming clouds and rain,\nor the ocean giving rise to moisture.\nThe qi of rivers and valleys\nnever ceases to flow into the ocean,\nnor does the ocean’s qi\ncease to return to the rivers and valleys.\nIf viewed through the Dao,\nthey are in constant cycle—\nnever a day without return.\nBut if grasped through instruments,\nthen land and water are divided,\nand their paths differ.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three: Knowing People is Wisdom**\nKnowing others is wisdom,\nknowing oneself is clarity.\nOvercoming others is strength,\novercoming oneself is power.\nKnowing contentment is wealth,\nunyielding action is resolve.\nNot losing one’s place is longevity,\ndying without perishing is life.\n\nWisdom lies in outward perception,\nclarity in inward reflection.\nStrength lies in outward victory,\npower in inward mastery.\nWisdom and strength are delusion,\nclarity and power are true.\nAll who enter the Dao’s gate\nmust pass through this.\n\nYet people cannot enter the Dao\nbecause they fail to see their own clarity,\nand are overcome by things.\nIf one’s inner clarity is true,\nthen one does not chase the external.\nNot chasing the external,\none gradually overcomes things.\nWith days deepened,\none naturally enters the Dao.\n\nAll who lack contentment\nare unaware of their own sufficiency.\nAll things are already within me—\nturning inward, I know:\nTaking what is within myself is enough—\nis this not wealth?\nContentment born,\nI gradually depart from all desires.\nThough strength is not yet complete,\nI cannot fully manifest what I see,\nso I must act with resolve.\nSeeing the pure root,\nI gradually return to the Dao.\nWithin emptiness, I verify the true attainment—\nunbound by past or future,\nvast and ever-present,\nthis is called not losing one’s place,\nequally viewing life and death,\nas morning and evening.\nLiving without attachment,\ndying without loss—\nthis is called life.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Four: The Great Dao Flows**\nThe great Dao flows—\nit can be turned to left or right.\nAll things depend on it for birth\nyet it does not claim credit.\nWhen its work is done,\nit does not name itself.\nIt loves and nourishes all things\nyet does not rule as king.\nEver without desire,\nit is called small.\nAll things return to it,\nyet it does not lord over them—\nthis is called great.\nThus the sage never claims to be great,\nand so can achieve true greatness.\n\nThe great Dao flows—\nfilling all eight extremes,\nyet when it acts,\nit seems to be at hand.\nAll things are not born without the Dao,\nyet the Dao never claims to have given them birth.\nAll things are not completed without the Dao,\nyet the Dao never names its own achievements.\nAll things are not nourished without the Dao,\nyet the Dao never considers itself their master.\n\nWhen it is small,\nits traces are not seen.\nWhen it is great,\nit does not lord over all things.\nYet all things return to it.\nSo too does the sage.\nNever claiming greatness,\nyet nothing surpasses them.\nIt is because they do not take greatness\nthat they achieve true greatness.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Five: Grasping the Great Image**\nGrasping the great image,\nthe world follows.\nFollowing without harm,\none is at peace, tranquil, and serene.\nPleasure and bait,\nand the Dao’s words—\nwhen spoken, they are bland as tastelessness;\nwhen seen, they are not visible;\nwhen heard, they are not audible;\nwhen used, they are inexhaustible.\n\nThe Dao descends and takes form—\nform arises, and things follow it.\nThe foolish follow without return,\nthe wise follow without harm.\nThose who follow without return\nlose the Dao and follow things.\nThose who follow without harm\ngo with the Dao.\n\nIf one goes with the Dao,\none never departs from it,\nand is at ease everywhere,\ntranquil everywhere,\nserene everywhere.\nUniting with the Dao,\none’s heart does not know the Dao,\nthe Dao does not know one’s heart.\nIf one knows the Dao and acts accordingly,\nthen there will be no ease,\nno tranquility,\nno serenity.\n\nThe sage’s relation to form and instruments\nis like a traveler’s stay in an inn—\ntemporarily dwelling, then departing,\nnever holding attachment.\nIf one is lured by pleasure and desire,\nthe traveler will stay at the inn,\nlingering without leaving—\nnone will escape harm.\nThus the sage, though among forms and instruments,\ngrasps the great image and follows,\nthough they follow things,\ntheir heart ever goes with the Dao.\nTasting the flavor of the flavorless,\nseeing the color of the colorless,\nhearing the sound of the soundless,\nusing the utility of the useless—\neven within forms and instruments,\nthey fully gather the Dao’s use.\nThis is how they remain at peace, tranquil, and serene.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Six: When One is About to...**\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Six: When One is About to...**\n\nWhen one is about to *weaken* it, one must first *reinforce* it.\nWhen one is about to *soften* it, one must first *strengthen* it.\nWhen one is about to *abolish* it, one must first *promote* it.\nWhen one is about to *take* it away, one must first *grant* it.\n\nThis is called *subtle clarity*—\nsoftness and weakness overcoming hardness and strength.\nA fish cannot be lifted from the depths,\nnor should the state’s sharpest tools be displayed to the people.\nThis is the sage’s method of *restraining the heart and seizing the emotions*.\n\nThe heart, as a thing,\nemerges and subsides without pause,\nits origin unknown.\nIf one tries to stop movement with stillness,\nstillness begets more movement—\nthe sage knows stillness cannot be forced.\nThus, when one seeks to *weaken*, they *reinforce*;\nwhen one seeks to *soften*, they *strengthen*;\nwhen one seeks to *abolish*, they *promote*;\nwhen one seeks to *take away*, they *grant*.\n\nTo seek stillness through movement,\none must observe delusion in motion—\nexhaust the movement, discard the delusion,\nand the true will return to stillness.\nThen, though one later seeks to move,\nthe heart will not stir.\nOnce the heart does not rise,\nstillness will not be generated.\n\nThis is the sage’s way of *weakening the heart, subduing the will,\nabolishing emotions, and seizing desires*—\nsubtle and hard to perceive,\nhence called *subtle clarity*.\nThis *subtle clarity*, though gentle and weak,\ncan overcome all underheavens’ desires for hardness and strength—\nfor it never departs from the *Dao-mother*.\nIf it departs from the *Dao-mother*,\nit is like a fish being lifted from the depths.\nSince a fish cannot be lifted from the depths,\nthe state’s sharpest tools must never be shown to the people.\nIf one shows them, people will doubt their sincerity.\nThis is why the world’s scholars fail to follow its essence,\noften mixing in Sun Wu’s military stratagems.\nThis is how the *Poetry* and *Rites* fall into ruin.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven: The Dao is Ever Without Action**\n\nThe Dao is ever without action,\nyet nothing remains undone.\nIf lords and kings can uphold it,\nall things will transform of their own accord.\nWhen transformation begins to take form,\nI will restrain it with the *nameless undifferentiated* (朴).\nThe *nameless undifferentiated* will also not desire.\nWithout desire, all will be still—\nthe world will naturally align.\nThe Dao, though without form, enters into form,\nbeginning with the stirrings of joy, anger, sorrow, and delight,\nand reaching completion in the fullness of ritual, music, punishments, and governance.\nOnce completed, if it does not return,\ntransformation becomes endless—\nthe more one strays from the Dao.\nThus the sage, when transformation is about to overflow,\nrestores it with the *nameless undifferentiated*.\nThe *nameless undifferentiated*, being nameless,\nthough used, appears as if without desire.\nIf one harbors a desire to use it,\nthen it is no longer the *nameless undifferentiated*.\nWithout desire, all will be still—\nthe people will naturally align.\n\n*End of Volume Two of the Explication of the Daoist Classic on Virtue and the Way* #1\n*\"Not chasing externals, one gradually overcomes things\"*:\n*\"chase\"* (惊) is likely a miswriting for *\"pursue\"* (骛).\n\n---\n*Volume Three of the Explication of the Daoist Classic on Virtue and the Way*\n*By the Daoist recluse, Xi Zhai*\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Eight: The Supreme Virtue Does Not Virtue**\n\nThe supreme virtue does not virtue,\nAnd thus has virtue.\nThe lesser virtue does not lose virtue,\nAnd thus has no virtue.\n\nThe supreme virtue acts without action yet nothing is left undone;\nThe lesser virtue acts and yet has much to do.\n\nThe supreme benevolence acts yet nothing is left undone;\nThe supreme righteousness acts and yet has much to do.\n\nThe supreme propriety acts and none respond,\nSo they roll up their sleeves and force it upon them.\nThus, when the Way is lost, virtue arises;\nWhen virtue is lost, benevolence arises;\nWhen benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;\nWhen righteousness is lost, propriety arises.\n\nFor propriety is the thinning of loyalty and trust,\nAnd the beginning of chaos.\nPrescience is the flourishing of the Way,\nAnd the origin of folly.\n\nThus, the noble one abides in substance, not in thinness;\nAbides in reality, not in flourishing.\nHence, they discard the latter and take the former.\n\nThe supreme virtue does not virtue,\nYet in benevolence, it is benevolent;\nIn righteousness, it is righteous.\nIt follows its course without clinging.\n\nThe lesser virtue does not lose virtue,\nYet benevolence cannot be made into righteousness,\nAnd righteousness cannot be made into propriety.\nOnce done, it cannot be altered.\n\nThus, the supreme virtue does not lose the Way.\nThe Way is ever without action,\nYet the mind of non-action is within it.\nThe lesser virtue does not lose virtue,\nYet virtue is with action,\nAnd the traces of action appear.\n\nThe supreme virtue is non-action—this is benevolence.\nBenevolence is near the Way,\nThus it is said: \"Man is benevolence.\"\nWhen combined, it is the Way.\nBenevolence is near the Way,\nThus it is also without action,\nAnd without anything to do.\n\nDescending to righteousness,\nRighteousness is what is fitting.\nTo act fittingly toward things,\nThere is something to do.\nYet acting does not lose what is fitting—\nIt is still not lost.\n\nDescending further to propriety,\nPropriety is order.\nTo order things with propriety,\nIf none respond yet I insist on ordering them,\nThen there will be those who roll up their sleeves and force it.\nThis cannot be called the Way,\nBut it can be called virtue.\nVirtue in man is benevolence;\nBenevolence not losing what is fitting is righteousness;\nRighteousness rectifying things is propriety.\nThus, when the Way is lost, virtue arises;\nWhen virtue is lost, benevolence arises;\nWhen benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;\nWhen righteousness is lost, propriety arises—\nThis is the natural order.\n\nFrom the Way descending five times,\nUntil it reaches propriety,\nAfter five descents, it is no longer worth observing.\n\nFor propriety arises from chaos,\nAnd because there are elders and juniors,\nWithout propriety, there is chaos,\nThus propriety is established to remedy it.\nYet when it comes to rolling up one’s sleeves and forcing it,\nThen propriety is also lost.\nThus, propriety is the beginning of chaos.\n\nMuch knowledge is insufficient for the Way,\nFor its excess confuses the true origin.\nKnowledge not from the true is empty and unreal.\nThus, much knowledge is the beginning of folly,\nAnd propriety is the thinning of loyalty and trust,\nWhile prescience is the flourishing of the Way.\n\nThe sage abides in substance, not in thinness,\nValues reality, not flourishing,\nThus they never lose the Way’s foundation.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine: The Ancient Who Obtained the One**\n\nThe ancient who obtained the One:\nThe heavens obtained the One and became clear,\nThe earth obtained the One and became tranquil,\nThe spirit obtained the One and became numinous,\nThe valleys obtained the One and became full,\nAll things obtained the One and came to life,\nThe sovereigns and kings obtained the One and became the rectifiers of the world.\nThis is how the One was attained.\n\nIf the heavens did not obtain the One, they would fear to crack;\nIf the earth did not obtain the One, they would fear to erupt;\nIf the spirit did not obtain the One, they would fear to cease;\nIf the valleys did not obtain the One, they would fear to dry up;\nIf all things did not obtain the One, they would fear to perish;\nIf the sovereigns and kings did not obtain the One, they would fear to fall.\n\nThus, the noble is rooted in the lowly,\nThe high is founded on the lowly,\nHence the sovereigns and kings call themselves \"lonely,\" \"widowed,\" \"not-grain\"—\nIs this not rooting in the lowly?\nIs it not?\n\nThus, when the carts are many, the axle is unseen,\nNot dazzling like jade, nor cold like stone.\nConfucius said: \"My Way is one and penetrates all.\"\nWhat is this \"one\"?\nThe clarity of the heavens,\nThe tranquility of the earth,\nThe numinosity of the spirit,\nThe fullness of the valleys,\nThe life of all things,\nThe rectification of the sovereigns and kings.\nPushing to its utmost, they are all the same.\n\nKnowing how the heavens are clear,\nOne knows how the earth is tranquil.\nKnowing how the spirit is numinous,\nOne knows how the valleys are full.\nKnowing how things come to life,\nOne knows how the sovereigns and kings rectify.\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* says:\n\"The world takes different paths yet arrives at the same destination;\nA hundred thoughts converge in one harmony.\"\nThe world—what does it think, what does it ponder?\nIt speaks of never not being one.\n\nIf one does not know the One,\nThen they must differ from themselves,\nAnd differing, they sever from things.\nIf the sovereigns and kings sever from things,\nThings will also sever from them.\n\nThus, the noble is rooted in the lowly,\nThe high is founded on the lowly,\nThe sovereigns and kings call themselves \"lonely,\" \"widowed,\" \"not-grain\"—\nIs this not knowing that the noble is rooted in the lowly?\n\nThe spokes and hubs converge to form the cart,\nYet the cart cannot be named.\nRen, yi, li, zhi combine to form the Way,\nYet the Way cannot be named.\nRewards, punishments, and rectifications combine to form governance,\nYet governance cannot be named.\n\nIf there is something to grasp and employ,\nIts traces appear externally—\nThe noble like jade, the lowly like stone—\nAll can be pointed to and named,\nAnd thus people begin to distinguish noble and lowly.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Forty: The Way’s Movement Is Return**\n\nThe Way’s movement is return;\nIts use is weakness.\n\nAll things under heaven are born of being,\nBeing is born of non-being.\nAll things under heaven are born as being,\nAnd only by returning to non-being #¹\nDo they become the Way.\nThus it is said: The Way’s movement is return.\n\nAll things under heaven are born of non-being,\nYet being must be strong.\nReturning strength to weakness,\nOne can gradually seek the Way.\nThus it is said: Weakness is the Way’s use.\n\nReturn is seeking non-being from being;\nWeakness is attaining non-being to seek the Way.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Forty-One: The Superior Man Hears the Way**\n\nThe superior man hears the Way and diligently practices it.\nThe mediocre man hears the Way and holds it as if it exists, as if it does not.\nThe inferior man hears the Way and laughs at it.\nIf he does not laugh, it is not the Way.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Two: The Way Produces Oneness**\n\nThe Way produces oneness,\nOneness produces twain,\nTwain produces the triad,\nThe triad produces all things under heaven.\n\nAll things under heaven bear yin while embracing yang,\nTheir clashing qi harmonizes as unity.\nWhat men detest are solitude, widowhood, and barrenness,\nYet kings and princes take them as titles.\n\nThus, some things are diminished yet grow,\nOthers are augmented yet decline.\nWhat men teach, I also teach:\nThe strong and violent shall not meet their end—\nI shall take them as my teachers.\n\nWhen the Way produces oneness,\nAt that time, oneness has not yet arisen.\nIf oneness does not arise,\nHow could there be twain?\nWithout twain, oneness does not scatter,\nThus it is called *not-twain*—\nSpeaking of its state before oneness emerged.\n\nWhen oneness arises, twain arises,\nAnd when yang arises, yin arises.\nWith yin and yang together,\nTheir interaction forms the harmonizing qi—\nThus, twain produces the triad.\nWhen the triad arises,\nThen all things exist.\n\nAll things embrace the singular yang,\nBear the dual yin.\nYin and yang interact,\nTheir clashing qi harmonizes—\nThis is the triad.\nWhich thing under heaven lacks these three?\n\nYet tracing their origin,\nThey must return to the Way.\nThe Way is that which has not yet produced oneness.\nSince their origin comes from the Way,\nTheir end does not stray from the Way.\nThus, things under heaven are sometimes diminished to grow,\nOr augmented to decline.\n\nSolitude, widowhood, and barrenness—\nYet kings and princes take them as titles—\nThis is diminishing to bring growth.\nThe violent and strong do not meet their end—\nThis is augmenting to bring decline.\nSince diminishing and augmenting share the same source,\nSelf-diminishing must bring growth,\nSelf-augmenting must bring decline.\n\nThe Sage never augments,\nYet takes solitude, widowhood, and barrenness as titles—\nTo make men know that the violent shall not meet their end.\nThis is called: *What men teach, I also teach.*\nIt is but the Way’s response to the age—\nHow could it be otherwise?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Forty-Three: The Supreme Softness**\n\nThe supreme softness under heaven\nOvercomes the supreme hardness under heaven.\nThat which has no entrance into the unbroken,\nI know this to be the benefit of *wuwei*.\n\nThe teaching of the unsaid,\nThe benefit of *wuwei*—\nFew under heaven attain it.\n\nThings are not truly things;\nHardness is a false form.\nEven the supreme hardness of Heaven\nMust ultimately return to non-being.\nNow, the supreme softness\nAlready overcomes the supreme hardness—\nHow much more can it shatter the falsehood of being?\n\nThus, there is none who can enter the unbroken.\nThe unbroken—\nTo tread upon water and fire,\nTo enter metal and stone,\nWithout losing one’s essence—\nThis is what is meant.\n\nThe practice of *wuwei*\nIs the Way’s action.\nThe teaching of the unsaid\nIs the teaching of Heaven.\n\n**Chapter 44: The Closeness of Name and Body**\n\nWhat is closer: name or body?\nWhat is more abundant: body or wealth?\nWhich brings greater harm: gain or loss?\nExcessive love leads to great expenditure,\nExcessive hoarding leads to great loss.\nKnowing contentment brings no disgrace,\nKnowing restraint brings no peril—\nThus one may endure long.\n\nName is not closer than the body,\nWealth is not more abundant than the body,\nGain does not compensate for loss.\nYet the world’s people always blame the name,\nDrown in wealth,\nAnd pursue gain—\nBecause they see nothing deeper.\nI love things, and the more I love, the more I expend.\nThings are stored within me, and the more there are, the more I labor.\nLittle love brings disgrace,\nGreat love brings danger—\nAnd there are regrets one cannot overcome.\n\nBut the noble person is not so.\nKnowing that all things are already complete within me,\nI reflect inwardly and find contentment—\nThus I seek nothing externally.\nEven if they wish to disgrace me,\nThey cannot.\nKnowing where my stopping lies,\nI halt at the Dao’s fullness—\nThus I act only in accord with the Dao.\nEven if they wish to make me act,\nThey cannot.\nThis is how I remain constant,\nAnd constant, I endure.\n\n**Chapter 45: The Great Completeness as if Deficient**\n\nThe great completeness appears as if deficient—\nIts use is unending.\nThe great fullness seems like emptiness—\nIts use is inexhaustible.\nThe most upright seems bent,\nThe most skillful seems clumsy,\nThe most eloquent seems tongue-tied.\nAgitation overcomes cold,\nQuietude overcomes heat.\nPurity and stillness are the rectitude of all under heaven.\n\nCompleteness and deficiency,\nFullness and emptiness,\nUprightness and bending,\nSkill and clumsiness,\nEloquence and silence—\nAll are mere semblances of things.\n\nOnly the Dao is nameless.\nTo seek it by form,\nOne can never attain it.\nThus, though completeness seems like deficiency,\nThough fullness seems like emptiness,\nThough uprightness seems like bending,\nThough skill seems like clumsiness,\nThough eloquence seems like silence—\nIts completeness is not in form,\nIts fullness is not in vessels,\nIts uprightness is not in strength,\nIts skill is not in the mind,\nIts eloquence is not in speech.\nTherefore, the world seeks it by semblance and form,\nYet can never attain it.\n\nThe world’s talk of Dao and skill\nHas never been without bias—\nLike agitation overcoming cold,\nYet failing to overcome heat,\nOr quietude overcoming heat,\nYet failing to overcome cold.\nEach has its proper limit.\nOnly purity, stillness, and *wuwei*\nNeed not seek to overcome things,\nYet none under heaven can overcome it.\nThus it is said: purity and stillness are the rectitude of all under heaven.\n\n**Chapter 46: Not Stepping Beyond the Door**\n\nNot stepping beyond the door,\nYet knowing all under heaven.\nNot peering through the window,\nYet seeing the Dao of Heaven.\nThe farther one goes,\nThe less one knows.\nThus the sage acts without moving,\nNames without seeing,\nAchieves without doing.\n\nThose who venture forth to seek Heaven and Earth\nSeek only their forms.\nHeaven and Earth cannot be fully grasped by form,\nYet can be fully understood by principle—\nThus the farther one goes,\nThe less one knows.\nIf one knows that their principle lies within,\nThen even closing the door suffices.\n\nThe sage knows the Dao is not in form,\nThus need not move;\nName is not in appearance,\nThus need not see;\nAchievement is not in action,\nThus need not do.\n\n**Chapter 47: When the World Follows the Dao**\n\nWhen the world follows the Dao,\nWarhorses are turned back to dung.\nWhen the world does not follow the Dao,\nWarhorses breed in the suburbs.\n\nNo crime is greater than desiring what should not be desired,\nNo calamity greater than failing to know contentment,\nNo fault greater than seeking what one has already obtained.\n\nThus, knowing contentment as contentment,\nOne is always content.\nWhen the world follows the Dao,\nIt can make soldiers serve the people.\nWhen the world does not follow the Dao,\nIt can make the people serve as soldiers.\n\nWhen one knows the Dao,\nIt can make color appear as void.\nWhen one does not know the Dao,\nIt can make void appear as color.\n\nDesiring what should not be desired—\nThis is love.\nFailing to know contentment—\nThis is taking.\nSeeking what one has already obtained—\nThis is having.\n\nFrom love arises taking,\nFrom taking arises having,\nAnd from having, endless faults proliferate.\nIf one knows that taking need not come from without,\nThis is called knowing contentment.\nKnowing contentment,\nOne knows no lack.\n\n**Chapter 48: Learning and the Dao**\n\nLearning increases daily,\nThe Dao decreases daily.\nDecrease it again and again,\nUntil one reaches *wuwei*—\nThen there is nothing one cannot do.\nTo take the world by doing nothing,\nYet when one does something,\nIt is insufficient to take the world.\n\nLearning is for seeking knowledge,\nThus it increases daily.\nThe Dao is for discarding illusion,\nThus it decreases daily.\nIf knowledge is not fully realized,\nThen decrease is not complete—\nThus, learning daily\nIs the means for daily decrease.\n\nIf one decreases again and again,\nIllusion is discarded and truth is fully realized,\nThen one attains *wuwei*.\nWhen *wuwei* is fully reached,\nEven if one takes the world,\nOne still does not see its use.\nIf one takes the world by doing something,\nOne cannot even obtain a single thing—\nHow much less can one take the world now?\n\nThe sage has no fixed heart.\n\n**Chapter 49: The Sage’s Heart**\n\nThe sage’s heart is without fixity—\nHe takes the hearts of the people as his own.\nThe good, I treat as good,\nThe not-good, I also treat as good—\nThis is virtue’s goodness.\nThe trustworthy, I trust,\nThe untrustworthy, I also trust—\nThis is virtue’s trust.\n\nThe sage moves among the people,\nHis presence makes their hearts pure as water—\nThe people all strain their ears and eyes,\nYet the sage treats them as children.\n\nGreat indeed is the harm of the heart!\nZhuangzi says: No thief is greater than virtue’s heart,\nAnd the heart’s eyes.\n\nThe heart, as a thing,\nPenetrates Heaven, and Heaven is penetrated;\nPenetrates Earth, and Earth is penetrated—\nNo distance it cannot reach.\nYet the world’s people take only distinctions for the heart.\nWhen the heart of distinctions arises,\nThey falsely see what is not,\nAnd lose their wholeness.\nThis is why Zhuangzi calls it a thief.\n\nThe sage’s heart\nIs always with the Dao,\nThe Dao is everywhere—\nThus his heart is everywhere.\nHence, he has no fixed heart.\nWhen it emerges to respond to the world,\nHe knows that all things follow illusion—\nThus the heart of taking and discarding never arises.\n\nThe good, I follow and treat as good,\nThe not-good, I also follow and treat as good—\nToward all under heaven, there is none I do not treat as good.\nThis is called virtue’s goodness.\n\n「信亦吾从而信，不信亦吾从而信，於天下无不信，是谓**德信**。」\n\nTrust, I follow and treat as trust,\nThe untrustworthy, I also follow and treat as trust—\nToward all under heaven, there is none I do not treat as trustworthy.\nThis is called **virtue’s trust**.\n\n怵怵然常恐天下之人**德有心**而**心有眼**，\n穿凿取与，不见大全。\n故每为天下浑其心。\n\nWith solemn dread, I fear that people under heaven\nWill **possess virtue with intent** and **have eyes in their hearts**,\nPiercing and grasping, yet failing to perceive the whole.\nThus, I always strive to make their hearts **undivided**.\n\n百姓用耳目所接者为明，\n而不知其非明也。\n圣人皆**孩**而**畜之**，\n使不为非明所乱。\n\nThe common folk take what their ears and eyes perceive as clarity,\nYet they do not know that this is not true clarity.\nThe sage **nurtures all like an infant**,\nSo that they are not disturbed by false clarity.\n\n然则非明者，\n岂**释氏**所谓**无明**者欤？\n\nThen, what is this false clarity?\nIs it not what the **Buddhist School** calls **ignorance**?\n\n出生入死章第五十\n**出生入死**，生之徒十有三，\n死之徒十有三。\n人之生，**动**之死地十有三。\n\n**Chapter 50: The Cycle of Birth and Death**\n**Birth and death**—thirteen times as birth,\nThirteen times as death.\nA man’s life is ever **moving** toward death’s domain thirteenfold.\n\n夫何故？\n以其生生之厚。\n盖闻善摄生者，\n陆行不遇兕虎，\n入军不被甲兵。\n兕无所投其角，\n虎无所措其爪，\n兵无所容其刃，\n夫何故？\n以其无死地。\n\nWhy so?\nBecause of the **excessive attachment to life**.\nYet those who master **life-nurturing** skill\nWalk on land and meet no rhino or tiger,\nEnter battle and are not struck by weapons.\nThe rhino finds no place to strike its horn,\nThe tiger finds no place to set its claws,\nThe weapons find no place to lodge their blades—\nWhy so?\nBecause they dwell beyond death’s reach.\n\n性无生死，\n出则为生，\n入则为死。\n有生则必有死，\n有出则必有入，\n物之所不能免也。\n今以一人之身言之，\n自少至壮，生之徒者也。\n自壮至老，**动**而之死者也。\n自老至死，死之徒者也。\n若以十计之，\n则生之徒十有三，\n死之徒十有三，\n**动**而之死者十有三。\n人自壮以上皆趁於死，\n是生之徒止有十三。\n自**动**而之死以至死之徒，\n合十有六。\n凡如此者何也？\n以其生生之厚也。\n自爱其生，\n而不爱物之生，\n凡可取以厚其生者无不为也，\n犹其生生愈后，\n故其趁死愈速。\n\nBy nature, there is no birth or death—\nOnly when it **emerges**, it is called birth,\nAnd when it **returns**, it is called death.\nWhere there is birth, there must be death,\nWhere there is emergence, there must be return—\nThis is what all things cannot escape.\nNow speaking of a single man’s life,\nFrom youth to vigor—this is the count of birth.\nFrom vigor to age, he **moves** toward death.\nFrom age to death—this is the count of death.\nIf we reckon by tens,\nThen birth is thirteen,\nDeath is thirteen,\nAnd **moving** toward death is thirteen.\nFrom vigor onward, all men **rush toward death**—\nThus, the count of birth is only thirteen.\nFrom **moving** toward death until death’s count,\nTogether they make sixteen.\nWhy all this?\nBecause of the **excessive attachment to life**.\nHe loves his own life,\nYet does not love the life of things—\nAll that can be taken to **thicken his life**, he does.\nThe more he **pursues life**, the more he **hastens death**,\nThus his rush toward death grows ever swifter.\n\n善养生者则不然。\n知生无生。\n既知无生，\n则死不可得。\n死不可得，\n则兕无所投其角，\n虎无所措爪，\n兵无所容刃。\n虽有生亦不生，\n既知不生，\n则知所谓不死矣。\n\nYet those who **skillfully nourish life** are otherwise.\nThey know that **birth is without substance**.\nOnce they know this,\nThen death cannot be attained.\nWhere death cannot be attained,\nThe rhino finds no place to strike its horn,\nThe tiger finds no place to set its claws,\nThe weapons find no place to lodge their blades.\nThough there is life, it does not **cling**—\nOnce they know it does not cling,\nThen they know what is meant by **not-death**.\n\n道生之章第五十－\n**道**生之，**德**畜之，\n物形之，**势**成之。\n是以万物莫不尊**道**而贵**德**。\n**道**之尊，**德**之贵，\n夫莫之命而常自然。\n故**道**生之，**德**畜之，\n长之育之，成之熟之，\n养之覆之，\n生而不有，为而不恃，\n长而不宰，\n是谓**玄德**。\n\n**Chapter 50: The Dao Gives Birth**\nThe **Dao** gives birth to it,\n**Virtue** nurtures it,\nThings take shape from it,\nAnd **momentum** brings it to completion.\nThus, all things do not fail to **revere the Dao** and **honor virtue**.\nThe **Dao’s reverence**, the **virtue’s honor**—\nNone command them, yet they always **operate naturally**.\nThus, the **Dao** gives birth to it,\n**Virtue** nurtures it,\n**Extends and cultivates** it,\n**Matures and perfects** it,\n**Nourishes and shelters** it—\nGiving birth yet not possessing,\nCreating yet not relying,\nExtending yet not controlling—\nThis is called **mysterious virtue**.\n\n物非**道**不生，\n非**德**不畜，\n自其有形，\n以至於**势**长，\n莫不以**道德**为主。\n**道**之尊，**德**之贵，\n至於此极矣。\n然不自尊其尊，\n不自贵其贵。\n其施於物非有心於物也，\n莫之命而常自然。\n自然而生，\n自然而畜，\n凡所以长育成熟，\n以至于养之覆之，\n莫非自然者，\n由其自然。\n故未尝望物之报，\n生不辞劳，\n施不求报，\n是谓**玄德**。\n\nThings cannot be born without the **Dao**,\nCannot be nurtured without **virtue**,\nFrom the moment they take form,\nUntil they grow in **momentum**,\nThey all rely on **Dao and virtue** as their foundation.\nThe **Dao’s reverence**, the **virtue’s honor**—\nThis reaches their utmost.\nYet they do not **self-revere their reverence**,\nNor **self-honor their honor**.\nTheir bestowal upon things is not done with **intent**—\nNone command them, yet they always **operate naturally**.\nThey **naturally give birth**,\nThey **naturally nurture**,\nAll that **extends, cultivates, matures, and perfects**,\nEven to **nourishing and sheltering**—\nNone of these are done otherwise,\nFor they follow their **nature**.\nThus, they never **seek the things’ recompense**,\nThey **do not shun labor in birth**,\nThey **bestow without demanding return**—\nThis is called **mysterious virtue**.\n\n天下有始章第五十二\n**天下有始**，以为天下母。\n既知其母，复知其子。\n既知其子，复守其母，\n没身不殆。\n**塞**其兑，**闭**其门，\n终身不勤。\n**开**其兑，**济**其事，\n终身不救。\n见小曰明，守柔曰强。\n用其光，复归其明，\n无遗身殃，\n是谓**袭常**。\n\n**Chapter 52: Heaven and Earth Have a Beginning**\n**Heaven and earth have a beginning**,\nAnd this is the **origin of all things**.\nOnce you know its **origin**,\nYou also know its **manifestation**.\nOnce you know its **manifestation**,\nYou also **hold fast to its origin**,\nAnd thus your life will not be **exhausted**.\n**Close its apertures** and **shut its gates**,\nAnd your strength will never **wan**.\n**Open its apertures** and **pursue its ends**,\nAnd your life will never **be preserved**.\nTo **perceive the minute** is called **clarity**,\nTo **hold fast to the soft** is called **strength**.\nTo **employ its radiance** and **return to its clarity**,\nIs to **leave no calamity behind**—\nThis is called **following the constant**.\n\n**Dao** as **origin**, things as **manifestation**.\nThe ancients who attained the **Dao**\nCould make **origin and manifestation** never part,\nAnd thus **Dao and things** became one.\nThings **emerge from Dao**,\nThings are not **other than Dao**,\nManifestation **comes from origin**,\nManifestation is not **other than origin**.\nThings are not **other than Dao**,\nYet the world **discards things** to seek **Dao**,\nManifestation is not **other than origin**,\nYet the world **discards manifestation** to seek **origin**—\nThey are not **other**, yet they **self-separate**,\nThus they never **attain unity**.\n\nIf you make men know that **things are the Dao**,\nThat **manifestation is origin**,\nAnd they **hold fast to this knowledge**,\nThen they will **find their roots on every side**,\nAnd there will be nothing difficult.\n\nThose who do not **follow the Dao** but instead **use things** to **lose the Dao**,\nAre like men who **open their apertures**.\n**Apertures** are **breaches**—\nTo **pierce their breaches** and **pursue their desires**,\nTheir **mind becomes agitated** and their **vital essence weakens**,\nThen **things perish** as they **grasp them**—\nYou must **close their apertures**,\n**Shut their gates**,\nSo that their **spirit does not exit**,\nAnd they **revolve back** to **nature’s origin**,\nThus **origin and manifestation** will not **part**,\nAnd **Dao and things** will become one.\n\nThe ancients who reached **perfection**,\n**Preserved their lives** and thus **lived**—\nThey employed this **Dao**.\n\nMan’s **breath** lies in **not exhausting the minute**,\nNor **nourishing the trifling**.\nIf you **exhaust the minute** or **nourish the trifling**,\nThough they be small, they must **be perceived as clarity**,\nThough they be trifling, they must **be held as strength**.\nThus it is said:\nTo **perceive the minute** is called **clarity**,\nTo **know the soft** is called **strength**.\n**Clarity** is the **root**,\n**Radiance** is what **emerges from clarity**.\n**Original clarity** is the **root**,\nIts **branches** divide into **vision**, **hearing**, **awareness**, and **contact**—\nAll are its **radiance**.\nThe **Dao** flows from **root to branch**,\nLearning **seeks the branch** to find the **root**—\nThus it is said:\nTo **employ its radiance** and **return to its clarity**,\nIs called **following the constant**.\n**Constant** is the **root**,\n**Clarity and radiance** naturally **emanate from clarity**—\nNow to **return radiance to clarity**,\nIs called **following the constant**.\n\n使我介然章第五十三\n**使我介然有知**，\n行於**大道**，\n惟施是畏。\n\n**Chapter 53: If I Were to Know**\n**If I were to know** with **distinction**,\nTo **walk the Great Way**,\nI would **fear only bestowal**.\n\n**Chapter 54: The Well-Established Cannot Be Uprooted**\n\nThe **Great Way** is most **level**,\nYet the people **love shortcuts**.\n\nThe **court is well-ordered**,\nYet the **fields lie fallow**,\nThe **granaries stand empty**,\nWhile they **adorn themselves with embroidery**,\n**Gird themselves with sharp blades**,\n**Indulge in food and drink**,\nAnd **hoard wealth**—\nThis is called **thieving splendor**,\nNot the **Way**.\n\nThe **Way** is not in **knowing**,\nFor **knowing** is **devious thought**.\n\nThe **true Way** must be **clear**,\nYet **clear** is not the same as **knowing**—\n**Knowing** cannot **grasp** it.\nThus, **bestowal** is **exhaustless**,\n**Use** is **unending**.\nIf I were to **walk the Great Way** with this **distinctive knowing**,\nMy **knowledge** would be **limited**,\nYet the **Way** is **boundless**—\n**Trembling**, I fear my **bestowal** may be **insufficient**,\nHence it is said:\n**\"I fear only bestowal.\"**\n\nIndeed, the **Great Way** is most **level**,\nYet the people **love shortcuts**.\nThose who **love shortcuts** **know** that **knowing** is **theft**.\n\nIf one **walks in ignorance**,\nThen **all** they see and hear is **the Way**—\nHow **vast** and **spacious** it is!\nThe **heart at ease**, **resting** each day.\n\nLater generations are not so.\nThe **court is well-ordered**—\n**\"Ordered\"** means **governed**.\nWhen the **court is governed**,\nThen **external adornments** arrive.\nThe **fields lie fallow**—\nThe **heart is ungoverned**.\nThe **granaries stand empty**—\n**Conduct is unrefined**.\nYet they **don their fine silks** to **dazzle others**,\n**Gird themselves with sharp blades** to **intimidate the masses**,\n**Hoard food and wealth** without **using them**—\nThis is called **thieving arrogance**.\nThus, they **drift far from the Way**.\n\nThe **well-established cannot be uprooted**.\n\nThe well-established cannot be uprooted,\nThe well-embraced cannot slip away.\nTheir descendants’ sacrifices never cease.\n\nWhen cultivated in the self, its virtue is **true**.\nWhen cultivated in the family, its virtue overflows.\nWhen cultivated in the village, its virtue endures.\nWhen cultivated in the state, its virtue flourishes.\nWhen cultivated in the world, its virtue is universal.\n\nThus, one observes the self through the self,\nThe family through the family,\nThe village through the village,\nThe state through the state,\nThe world through the world.\n\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nBy this.\n\nThose who build achievements stop when their purpose is fulfilled.\nThose who hoard wealth and profit perish when their gains scatter.\nYet those who ensure descendants’ sacrifices never cease\nAre none other than those who establish the **Dao** and embrace **virtue**.\n\nThe Sage cultivates the **true Way** in the self,\nExtends its overflow to govern the family,\nAnd reaches the village, the state, and the world.\n\nYet the Sage observes the self through the self, but their intent is not confined to the self;\nObserves the family through the family, but their intent is not confined to the family;\nObserves the state through the state, but their intent is not confined to the state;\nObserves the world through the world, but their intent is not confined to the world.\n\nEach follows what is present,\nAnd observes accordingly.\n\nIn the *Yijing*’s observation:\n*\"Washing without offering\"*—\n**Faith** shines like the sun.\nThe lower transforms through observation,\nWashing without offering—\n**Sincerity**, not things, is what matters.\n\nIts effect reaches the lower transforming:\nWhen the world is observed through the world,\nThe lower are transformed without haste yet swiftly.\n\n---\n**Chapter 55: The Depth of Contained Virtue**\n\nThe depth of contained virtue\nIs like that of an infant.\n\nPoisonous insects do not sting,\nFierce beasts do not seize,\nSnatching crows do not clutch.\n\nBones are weak, sinews supple, yet their grip is firm.\nThey do not know the union of male and female yet rise erect—\nThe utmost of **essence**.\nThey wail all day without exhaustion—\nThe utmost of **harmony**.\n\nTo know harmony is to know constancy,\nTo know constancy is to know clarity,\nTo increase life is to bring auspiciousness,\nTo let the **heart** command **qi** is strength.\n\nWhen things grow strong, they age—\nThis is called **not-Dao**.\n**Not-Dao** perishes early.\n\nThis passage speaks of poisonous insects not stinging,\nFierce beasts not seizing,\nSnatching crows not clutching—\nIts original text, from beginning to end, is all about the infant.\n\nYet the world doubts these three things harming the infant.\nZi You once said: *\"The tiger fears those who do not fear it.\"*\nSu Shi said: *\"The world has never seen one who sees a tiger and is not afraid.\"*\nThen how can this claim be proven true or false?\n\nAgain, it is said:\n*A woman placed two children on the sand while washing clothes in water.\nA tiger charged down from the mountain.\nThe two children played on the sand as usual.\nThe tiger butted them with its head, hoping to frighten them.\nBut the children, oblivious, did not react—\nAnd the tiger finally left.*\n\nIs this not what is meant by *\"fierce beasts do not seize\"*?\n\nYet when hands hold nothing yet are firm,\nWhen the **yang** lacks desire yet acts,\nWhen wailing continues all day without exhaustion—\nWho makes this so?\n\nIt is because their **qi** is whole, their **essence** unified,\nTheir harmony is supreme—the utmost of **yang**.\n\nIf one nourishes their **qi** and attains harmony,\nEnsuring harmony does not wane with strength but endures—\nThis is called **constancy**.\n\n**Constancy** is the natural way of things,\nNot something wrought by will.\nTo know **constancy** as **constancy** is **clarity**.\nTo know **clarity** as **constancy**, and clarity increasing—\nThis is called **auspiciousness**.\nThe **heart** commands **qi**, yet **qi** does not serve the **heart**—\nThis is **straight strength**.\n\nAll things, when strong, must age.\nFrom strength onward, they lose the infant’s heart.\nMencius said:\n*\"The noble one does not lose the heart of the infant.\"*\n\nTo lose the infant’s heart is **not-Dao**.\n**Not-Dao** perishes early.\n\n---\n**Chapter 56: The Wise Do Not Speak**\n\nThe wise do not speak,\nThose who speak are not wise.\nBlock the **mouth**,\nClose the **gate**,\nDull the sharp,\nUntangle the tangled,\nBlend their light,\nAlign with the dust—\nThis is called **mysterious unity**.\n\nThus, they cannot be approached or distanced,\nCannot be used for gain or harm,\nCannot be honored or degraded.\nTherefore, they are the world’s most noble.\n\nAll that the world possesses\nIs but a dream’s realm.\nThus, the wise do not speak,\nFor speech cannot exhaust knowledge.\n\nThe world’s ignorant cling to dreams as reality,\nChattering endlessly, never departing from dreams.\nThus, they do not know speech,\nFor their vision has not yet reached.\n\nBlock the **mouth**—\nBe cautious in utterance.\nClose the **gate**—\nKeep people at a distance.\n\n**Chapter 56 (continued): The Wise Do Not Speak**\n\nDulling the sharp—\nThis is to govern their inner nature.\nUntangling the tangled—\nThis is to regulate their outer conduct.\nBlending their light—\nThis is to suppress what resides within themselves.\nAligning with the dust—\nThis is to follow what exists in things.\nWithout exit or entrance,\nWithout inner or outer,\nWithout self or things—\nThis is called **mysterious unity**.\n\nHaving attained this unity,\nThey are called *approachable yet distant*,\n*distant yet near*,\n*useful yet without delight*,\n*harmful yet without fear*,\n*noble yet without arrogance*,\n*lowly yet without humiliation*.\nAll things are insufficient to name them,\nThus, they are the world’s most noble.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 57: The Way of Governance with Rectitude**\n\nGovern with **rectitude**,\nEmploy **strangeness** in war,\nConquer the world through **non-action**—\nHow do I know this is so?\n\nBecause of this:\nThe world abounds with **taboos and prohibitions**,\nYet the people grow ever poorer.\nThe people possess many **sharp tools**,\nYet the state grows ever more **corrupt**.\nMen excel in **crafts and cunning**,\nYet **strange things** proliferate.\nLaws and decrees grow ever more **prominent**,\nYet **thieves and robbers** abound.\nThus, the Sage says:\n*\"I act with non-action, yet the people transform themselves.\nI love tranquility, yet the people become upright.\nI do no work, yet the people grow rich.\nI have no desires, yet the people remain simple.*\n\nI govern with **rectitude** by relying on the people’s inherent uprightness.\nI employ **strangeness** in war by relying on the inherent strangeness of arms.\nI conquer the world through **non-action** by relying on the world’s inherent lack of strife.\n\nAll my responses to things—\nDo they stem from me?\nOr do they stem from things themselves?\n\nThe Sages of old could make the world as one body,\nAnd China as one person,\nBecause their governance issued from **self-cultivation**.\n\nIf I abound in **taboos and prohibitions**,\nThen restrictions and defenses must be established.\nOnce restrictions are established,\nHow can the people avoid becoming poor?\n\nIf I show the people **sharp tools**,\nThen the people will vie for their use.\nOnce the people vie for **sharp tools**,\nHow can the state avoid **corruption**?\n\nIf I display **crafts and cunning**,\nThen the people will excel in **technique and deceit**.\nOnce **technique and deceit** prevail,\nHow can **strange things** fail to proliferate?\n\nIf I rule the people with **laws and decrees**,\nThen the people will also **steal laws** to benefit themselves.\nWhen rulers and subjects **deceive each other**,\nHow can **thieves and robbers** fail to abound?\n\nThe Sage teaches **non-action**,\nTeaches **tranquility**,\nTeaches **non-strife**,\nTeaches **non-desire**—\nThen the people respond in kind to what is shown them.\nThus, it is said:\n*\"The people are like grass—\nWhen the wind blows over them, they must bend.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 58: The Nature of Governance**\n\nWhen governance is **obscure and subtle**,\nIts people are **pure and sincere**.\nWhen governance is **overbearing and scrutinizing**,\nIts people are **deceitful and lacking**.\n\nCalamity, ah! Fortune depends upon it,\nFortune, ah! Calamity lurks within it.\nWho knows their ultimate end?\nLet there be no **erroneous governance**!\n\nWhat is **rectitude** becomes **strangeness**,\nWhat is **good** becomes **deceit**.\nThe people’s confusion has endured for ages.\n\nThus, the Sage is **square yet not rigid**,\n**Honest yet not harmful**,\n**Straightforward yet not domineering**,\n**Illuminating yet not blinding**.\n\nWhen governance is **obscure and subtle**,\nAs though demanding nothing of the people,\nYet the people do not respond with **crafts and cunning** to their rulers—\nThus, their people are **pure and sincere**.\n\nWhen governance is **overbearing and scrutinizing**,\nAs though gaining something for themselves,\nYet the people use **crafts and cunning** to evade—\nThus, their people are **deceitful and lacking**.\n\nThe world’s affairs,\nWhere calamity and fortune **interdependently arise**,\nHave endured for ages.\n\nWhen governance is **obscure and subtle**,\nThere is no gain for me,\nYet there is gain for the people.\nWhen governance is **overbearing and scrutinizing**,\nThere is loss for the people,\nYet there is gain for me.\nMy gain means their loss,\nMy fortune means their calamity—\nThus, the **natural principle** operates.\n\nThe **ignorant** do not know the **rectitude of Dao/Way**,\nAnd they insist on **overbearing scrutiny** as clarity,\nSeeking **fortune through chance**,\nThus causing **rectitude** to transform into **strangeness**,\nAnd **good fortune** to become **deceit**.\n\nThe people’s confusion has endured for ages—\nThus, the Sage is **square yet not rigid**,\n**Straightforward yet not domineering**,\n**Illuminating yet not blinding**.\n\nIn **rewards, punishments, laws, and governance**,\nThere are **rules**—\nYet if they are not applied to their fullest extent,\nThen **strangeness** can revert to **rectitude**,\nAnd **deceit** can change into **goodness**.\n\nThus, it is said:\n*\"When **teaching and transformation** are practiced,\nThey draw the **ordinary** into the realm of the **Noble**.\nWhen **teaching and transformation** are abandoned,\nThey cast the **ordinary** into the path of the **petty**.\nThis must not be forgotten.\"*\n\nThe *Exegesis of the True Classic of Dao and Virtue* concludes here.\n\n**Chapter 59: Governing People and Serving Heaven**\n\n*\"To govern people and serve Heaven, nothing surpasses frugality.*\nFrugality alone enables early cultivation.\nEarly cultivation is called the accumulation of profound virtue.\nProfound virtue accumulated means nothing is unconquerable.\nIf nothing is unconquerable, its limits are unknown.\nWhen its limits are unknown, one can possess a realm.\nThe mother of possessing a realm is what makes it endure.\nThis is the Dao of deep roots and firm foundation,\nOf enduring life and long vision.\nIn governing externally, in serving Heaven internally—\nNone surpasses frugality.\n\nFrugality means nothing is left unharmonized.\nTo be cautious within, to be tranquil without,\nTo let the inner mind not stray, the outer mind not rise—\nThis is called harmonization, and thus one can cultivate early.\n\nTo cultivate within the heart, to cultivate without the form,\nTo remain still and unmoving—\nThen virtue begins to accumulate.\nAccumulating in what is not accumulated,\nNothing can be unconquered.\nIf nothing is unconquered, nothing remains untamed.\nEven with a realm, it is still attainable.\n\nPeople know one can possess a realm,\nBut they do not know that those who can possess a realm\nAre those who have their roots.\nWhen roots are deeply planted,\nEven dross and husks are refined into Yao and Shun—\nWhat of those beneath them?\n\nThis is called deep roots and firm foundation,\nThe Dao of governing people and serving Heaven.\"\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 60: Governing a Great Realm**\n\n*\"To govern a great realm, treat it as you would a delicate fish.\nTo rule the world with the Dao,\nIts spirits are not numinous.\nNot that its spirits are not numinous—\nThey do not harm people.\nNot that they do not harm people—\nThe Sage does not harm people.\nSince neither harms the other,\nVirtue returns in exchange.\n\nGoverning a realm is the Sage’s remaining task,\nNo different than cooking a delicate fish.\nThough strange, cunning, and bizarre,\nThe Dao unifies all—\nThus, its spirits are not numinous.\nNot that its spirits are not numinous—\nIf spirits were numinous,\nAll strange, cunning, and bizarre would transform into the Dao.\nHow could the Dao harm anyone?\n\nThe intent is to not harm people,\nSo even in the unseen—spirits and gods—\nThey cannot harm with their numinosity.\nIn governance and in the unseen,\nNeither harms the other—\nThus, the hearts of people and spirits return in harmony.\nIs this not the work of supreme virtue?\"\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 61: Great Realms as the World’s Dependent**\n\n*\"Great realms are the world’s tributary.\nThe world’s tributary is like the female.\nThe female always overcomes the male by stillness,\nBy yielding as inferior.\n\nThus, when a great realm yields to a small realm,\nIt takes the small realm.\nWhen a small realm yields to a great realm,\nIt takes the great realm.\nSometimes yielding to take,\nSometimes yielding while taking—\nA great realm seeks only to nurture others,\nA small realm seeks only to serve others.\n\nBoth gain what they desire,\nSo the great should properly yield.\nIf a great realm yields to obtain things,\nThings will surely return to it.\nThe female, yielding in stillness, overcomes the male.\nThus, the female always overcomes the male.\nIf a great realm yields to a small realm, it will surely obtain the small realm.\nIf a small realm yields to a great realm, it will surely obtain the great realm.\nThus, the great realm sometimes yields to take the small,\nThe small realm sometimes yields to take the great.\nTaking means each secures its own heart.\n\nTherefore, a great realm seeks only to nurture small realms,\nA small realm seeks only to serve great realms—\nOnly thus do both attain what they desire.\n\nMencius said:\n‘To serve the great with the small is to fear Heaven.\nTo serve the small with the great is to delight in Heaven.\nThose who delight in Heaven preserve the world,\nThose who fear Heaven preserve their realm.\nThus, great realms should especially yield.’\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 62: The Dao as the Essence of All Things**\n\n*\"The Dao is the essence of all things.\nThe good person’s treasure,\nThe unvirtuous person’s refuge.\nFine words can be sold,\nNoble conduct can be bestowed upon others.\nWhy would anyone abandon what is not good?\nThus, when establishing a Son of Heaven,\nAppointing the Three Ministers—\nEven with a jade tablet and four swift horses offered first,\nIt is not as good as presenting this Dao.\n\nWhy did the ancients value this Dao?\nNot merely to gain rewards,\nNor to escape punishments.\nThus, it is prized by the world.\n\nEssence means to hide.\nThe Dao is what all things treasure,\nLike a hidden storehouse for things.\nThe virtuous take the Dao as their treasure,\nThus, they rejoice in their gains.\nThe unvirtuous have no refuge but the Dao,\nThus, they rejoice in escaping blame.\nThis is rooted in the natural heart of humanity,\nWithout artificial prompting.\n\nThus, if speech aligns with the Dao,\nIts beauty can be sold.\nIf conduct aligns with the Dao,\nIts nobility can be bestowed upon others.\nIf not rooted in the natural heart,\nSpeech will not be followed,\nConduct will not be emulated.\n\nSince all are rooted in the Dao,\nIf by misfortune one falls into vice,\nHow could the Sage abandon them?\nThus, establishing a Son of Heaven,\nAppointing the Three Ministers—\nIt is not for trivial gain of wealth and honor.\nRather, to prevent abandoning people in vice,\nAnd to restore them with this virtuous Dao.\n\nEven if one offers a jade tablet and four swift horses,\nIt is not as good as speaking a good word,\nPerforming a good deed,\nSo that no one in the world loses their virtue—\nWhat benefit could be greater?\n\nThis is called presenting the Dao while seated.\nWhy did the ancients value this Dao?\nBecause the virtuous gain without delay.\nIf the unvirtuous, by misfortune, reach virtue,\nThey can still escape blame—\nIs this not worthy of the world’s esteem?\"\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 63: Doing Without Doing**\n\n*\"Do without doing,\nAct without acting,\nTaste without tasting.\nGreat or small, many or few—\nRepay resentment with virtue.\nAttempt the difficult in its ease,\nAchieve the great in its smallness.\n\nThe world’s difficult tasks must begin in ease.\nThe world’s great tasks must begin in smallness.\nThus, the Sage never acts in grandness,\nAnd so achieves the grand.\"*\n\n**Chapter 63: Doing Without Doing (continued)**\n\n*\"He who lightly promises must often break faith,\nHe who seeks ease must often court difficulty.\nThus the Sage treats difficulty as difficulty,\nAnd so never encounters difficulty.\n\nDo without doing—then oneself does not labor.\nAct without acting—then others are not troubled.\nTaste without tasting—then things are not exhausted.\nWhat the world calls ‘great or small, many or few’—\nThis is but a matter of form.\n\nThe Sage moves beyond form and instrument,\nSo great and small, many and few—\nAre equal and made one.\n\nIf great and small, many and few,\nAre already equal and unified,\nHow much more so the distinctions of favor and resentment,\nOf repayment and bestowal?\n\nWhat I do and what I bestow—\nIs virtue alone.\nHow could I know of resentment,\nHow could I know of repayment?\n\nSince there is no distinction between favor and resentment,\nNo difference between great and small, many and few,\nThen in regard to the world’s affairs,\nHow could there be any intent to act?\n\nDifficult tasks must be approached in ease,\nGreat tasks must begin in smallness.\nFrom ease proceed, and even difficulty becomes easy.\nFrom smallness act, and even greatness becomes small.\n\nThus the Sage never acts in grandness,\nAnd so grandness must return to him—\nBecause he holds no intent.\n\nIt is only because the Sage holds no intent in action,\nThat he never seeks results before the deed is done.\nHow unlike the petty men of the world,\nWho promise before they act,\nAnd when the task arrives, seek ease!\n\nTo promise before acting brings few fulfilled words,\nTo seek ease in difficulty brings many failures.\nThe Sage, before the task arrives,\nEver treats it as though it were difficult.\nNot that it is difficult,\nBut he does not assume it must be achieved by force,\nAnd so treats it as difficult.\n\nOnly because he treats it as difficult,\nDoes he never encounter difficulty.\n\n**Chapter 64: The Ease of Holding**\n\n*\"Its ease lies in its firmness,\nIts firmness in its quietude.\nIts frailty lies in its boldness,\nIts subtlety in its dispersion.\n\nAct before it exists,\nOrder before it is disordered.\nA tree as thick as a man’s embrace\nGrows from a tiny sprout.\nA nine-tiered tower\nRises from a pile of earth.\nA thousand-li journey\nBegins beneath one’s feet.\n\nThe doer brings ruin,\nThe grasper loses hold.\nThus the Sage does not act—so he knows no ruin.\nHe does not grasp—so he knows no loss.\n\nThe people’s undertakings\nOften fail when nearly complete.\nTo be cautious at the end and know the beginning—\nThen there will be no ruined work.\n\nThus the Sage desires without desiring,\nDoes not prize hard-to-obtain goods.\nHe learns without learning,\nReturns to the errors of the common folk.\nTo aid the natural unfolding of all things,\nAnd not dare to act.\n\nThe Sage ever rests in what is at rest,\nSo his rest knows no disturbance,\nAnd his holding knows no fixation—\nHence, it is called ‘easy to hold.’\n\nBy not holding, he holds his ease.\nIf even the slightest intention arises,\nHe plans against it before it shows,\nBreaks it before it hardens,\nScatters it before it spreads—\nAnd so none can disrupt his ease.\n\nFrom holding ease before it exists,\nFrom ordering the mind before it is disordered.\nLike a tree as thick as a man’s embrace\nGrowing from a tiny sprout,\nA nine-tiered tower rising from a pile of earth,\nA thousand-li journey beginning beneath one’s feet—\nIn the midst of *non-doing*, it naturally comes to pass,\nIn the midst of *non-accumulation*, it naturally accumulates.\n\nDay by day, burdens fade away,\nDay by day, virtue grows—\nYet the Sage never knows of it.\nIf one acts with intent,\nThen one brings ruin.\nIf one grasps with intent,\nThen one loses hold.\n\nBecause he does not act, he knows no ruin.\nBecause he does not grasp, he knows no loss.\nThe world’s difficulty in attaining the Dao\nAnd its ease in destroying it—\nArises from its intent to act and to grasp.\n\nWhen its beginning, it seems to have no room for effort,\nAnd when its end, it still cannot escape neglect.\nAll are the faults of acting and grasping.\n\nIf at its beginning one did not act,\nIf at its beginning one did not grasp,\nThen one could not even find its effort—\nHow much less its neglect?\n\nThis is why the world’s undertakings\nOften fail when nearly complete.\n\nThe Sage alone\nTakes ‘not desiring’ as desiring,\nDoes not prize hard-to-obtain goods.\nWhat is called ‘hard to obtain’—\nIs not necessarily gold and jade.\nThings outside the self,\nAll are hard to obtain.\n\nThe common folk’s eyes are bewildered by color,\nTheir ears by sound.\nI take ‘not learning’ as learning,\nRetreat the gaze and invert the hearing,\nReturn to the errors of the common folk,\nTo aid the Dao’s natural unfolding—\nAnd dare not act.\n\nOh, how could there be any disease of acting and grasping?\nThe ancients’ skill in cultivating the Dao—\n\n**Chapter 65: The Ancients’ Skill in Cultivating the Dao**\"\n\nThe ancients who excelled in cultivating the Dao\nDid not enlighten the people,\nBut rather sought to befuddle them.\n\nThe people are hard to govern\nBecause their cleverness is excessive.\nTo govern with cleverness—\nIs the ruin of the state.\nNot to govern with cleverness—\nIs the blessing of the state.\n\nTo know these two is called the *lǐ* (pattern).\nTo be able to know the *lǐ*—\nThis is called *xuán dé* (mysterious virtue).\n\nThe mysterious virtue is profound and distant,\nOpposed to things.\nOnly then does one reach great harmony.\n\nWhat is called ‘seeing and hearing, awareness and knowledge’—\nDoes not lie in sounds and colors.\n\nYet the world’s eyes see not color,\nIts ears hear not sound,\nAnd is hindered by sounds and colors,\nUnknowing that seeing and hearing,\nAwareness and knowledge,\nExtend beyond sounds and colors.\n\nNow if I suddenly told people:\n‘Your seeing and hearing, your awareness and knowledge—\nAll are not true!’\nThen who would not be astonished and scornful?\n\nThus the Dao is not to enlighten the people,\nBut rather to befuddle and love them—\nThis is acceptable.\n\nThe people’s befuddlement\nIs hindered by sounds and colors,\nAnd they do not know how to free themselves.\nI will show them *non-doing*,\nI will show them *dànpō* (tranquil simplicity),\nYet they still do not awaken—\nHow much less could I enlighten them with cleverness?\n\nThe people’s affliction lies in their excess of cleverness.\nIf cleverness is not used rightly,\nThen their cleverness becomes perverse.\nNow I cannot awaken their perversity,\nAnd yet I would enlighten them with cleverness—\nThis is to open their deceit anew.\n\nThus to govern with cleverness is ruin to the state.\nIf one follows what is without action,\nAnd does not open the people’s scheming hearts,\nThen scheming does not arise,\nAnd purity and wholeness are complete—\nThis is called the blessing of the state.\nIs this not acceptable?\n\nThe actions of the ruler above\nAre emulated by the people below.\nThere has never been a case where I am tranquil and they are agitated,\nOr where I am simple and the people are filled with desires.\n\nTo know the *lǐ* and to know the *lǐ*—\nThis is called *xuán dé* (mysterious virtue).\"\n\n「Mysterious virtue is profound and distant,\nFor its alignment is contrary to all things,\nThus it cannot be made clear to the people.\nBy its harmony with the Dao,\nIt is therefore called the Great Order.\n\n**Why the Sea and Rivers Are Sovereign Over All Valleys (Chapter 66)**\nThe sea and rivers can be sovereign over all valleys\nBecause they excel in yielding to them,\nThus they can be sovereign over all valleys.\nTherefore, the sage who wishes to lead the people\nDoes so by speaking from below.\nWho would be first among the people\nDoes so by placing himself behind them.\nThus, though he stands above them, the people do not feel burdened,\nThough he leads them, they are not harmed.\nHence, the world gladly follows and never tires.\nBecause he does not contend,\nNo one in the world can contend with him.\n\nWhen the sage, of necessity, governs the world,\nHe views those who first emerge from the myriad things\nAnd those who stand above the people\nAs matters of equal concern.\nThus, though he holds the world,\nHe leads the people by speaking from below,\nAnd governs them by placing himself behind.\nIt is not the one who forgets the world\nWho can do this.\nTherefore, though he stands above the people, they do not feel burdened,\nAnd though he leads them, they do not know he is their ruler.\nThough he stands before the people, they are not harmed,\nAnd though he leads them, they do not know he is their leader.\nOnly when both above and below forget each other,\nIs it that the world gladly follows and never tires.\nFor the things I take are not what the people contend for.\nThe Way of *wuwei* (non-action),\nThe world does not even see its traces—\nHow much less would it dare contend with me?\n\n**The World’s Praise of My Dao (Chapter 67)**\nThe world all says my Dao is vast,\nYet seems unlike the common.\nOnly because it is vast,\nDoes it seem unlike the common.\nIf it seemed like the common,\nLong ago it would have been trifling.\n\nI have three treasures, which I hold and preserve:\nThe first is *cí* (benevolence/mercy),\nThe second is *jiǎn* (frugality),\nThe third is *bù gǎn wéi tiānxià xiān* (not daring to act before the world).\n\nBenevolence makes one courageous,\nFrugality makes one abundant,\nNot daring to act before the world\nMakes one a vessel of lasting worth.\nNow if I abandon my benevolence and yet seek courage,\nAbandon my frugality and yet seek abundance,\nAbandon my humility and yet act before the world,\nI shall perish.\n\nBenevolence—\nWhen wielding arms, it wins;\nWhen defending, it holds firm.\nHeaven, when about to save, uses benevolence to shield.\nThe common seek only outward form.\nIf one seeks the great through outward form,\nEven reaching to the heavens and earth,\nIt is still where his pursuit ends.\nThe world all calls it great,\nYet it seems unlike the common.\nOnly because it is great,\nDo all things prove insufficient to match its likeness.\nIf it had such likeness,\nThen I too would be but one thing,\nAnd my greatness would have long since faded.\n\nYet the means by which I achieve greatness\nStill rely on these three treasures to hold and preserve:\nThe first is *cí* (benevolence/mercy),\nThe second is *jiǎn* (frugality),\nThe third is *bù gǎn wéi tiānxià xiān* (not daring to act before the world).\nThese three are not the means to greatness,\nYet those who wield greatness\nCannot surpass them.\n\nGreatness cannot be sought through outward form.\nGreatness does not rely on outward form\nYet fully realizes its use,\nThus its greatness is beyond measure.\nOnly through benevolence\nCan one save all things.\nWhen things lose their place,\nEven if they tread on water and fire,\nOr rush toward blades—\nThey would not hesitate.\nThis is not the courage of a single man\nThat can match it.\n\nOnly through frugality\nCan one truly give.\nFor the more meager my desires,\nThe broader my giving—\nThis is not the greatness without purpose\nThat can match it.\n\nOnly by not daring to act before the world\nCan one meet things without strain.\nFor not acting first,\nAll that is done is merely in response.\nResponding without leading,\nAction does not originate from me.\nThough I act, no one blames me—\nThis is not the stirring of strife or creation of affairs\nThat can match it.\n\nCourage depends on benevolence,\nThus its vigor is unexhausted.\nAbundance depends on frugality,\nThus its breadth knows no end.\nLeading depends on following,\nThus its firstness is unstoppable.\nIf one relies only on courage,\nOnly on abundance,\nOnly on acting first,\nThen by the end of the day he shall die.\n\nNow, arms—\nThey are the most ominous of instruments.\nIf not rooted in benevolence,\nTo save the people from water and fire,\nTo make them know that all who kill are not benevolent,\nI have not seen their worth.\nI use benevolence to save the people,\nAnd Heaven too shall use benevolence to shield them.\n\n**The Art of Governance (Chapter 68)**\nThe skilled in governance are not martial,\nThe skilled in war do not rage,\nThe skilled in defeating enemies do not contend,\nThe skilled in using people place them below.\n\nThis is called the virtue of non-contention,\nThis is called the power of using people,\nThis is called aligning with Heaven—\nThe ultimate of the ancients.\nThe sage does not even possess a self,\nHow much less would he contend.\nBecause he does not contend,\nAll that he responds to\nIs what he cannot help but do.\n\nThus, when he is a scholar, he is not martial,\nWhen he wages war, he does not rage,\nWhen he defeats enemies, he does not need to contend with them,\nWhen he uses people, he does not need to place himself above them.\nTherefore, he can serve the people with virtue,\nAnd the people will gladly die for him—\nThis is called aligning with Heaven,\nThe ultimate of the ancients.\n\n**The Use of Arms (Chapter 69)**\nThe use of arms has its words:\nI do not dare to be the host while being the guest,\nI do not dare to advance an inch while retreating a foot.\n\nThis is called *xíng wú xíng* (action without action),\n*rǎng wú bì* (repelling without arms),\n*chéng wú dí* (withstanding without enemies),\n*zhí wú bīng* (seizing without arms).\n\nNo disaster is greater than underestimating the enemy,\nFor underestimating the enemy\nNearly forfeits my treasures.\nThus, when armies clash and add to each other’s woes,\nThe one who laments will win.\n\nDuke Ling of Wei asked Confucius about warfare.\nConfucius replied:\n*The matter of offerings and sacrifices,\nI have heard of them.\nBut military affairs,\nI have not studied them.*\nAs for his own words:\n*I fight and conquer,\nI sacrifice and receive blessings.*\n\nMencius also said:\n*If the present-day rulers of states\nWere to practice the kingly Dao,\nThen the people of neighboring states\nWould look up to them as to parents.\nYet they would lead their sons and brothers\nTo attack their own parents—\nSince the birth of the people,\nThere has never been one who could succeed in this.*\n\nThe words of Confucius and Mencius are no more than this.\nLaozi said:\n*I do not dare to be the host while being the guest,\nI do not dare to advance an inch while retreating a foot.*\nHe also said:\n*Arms are the most ominous of instruments;\nHe who delights in killing cannot fulfill his ambitions in the world.*\n\nFollowing this reasoning,\nIt is also what Confucius meant—\nI have not heard Mencius speak of the kingly Dao.*\n\nWhen forced to wage war, it is as though one walks without feet, seizes without arms, fights without weapons, and grasps without hands. This is what Confucius meant by *\"I fight and conquer,\"* and what Mencius meant by *\"There has never been one who could succeed in this.\"*\n\nThe Sage’s use of arms is always a last resort. How could there be a heart to seek victory through reckless daring? If I were to dare lightly and yet act upon it, then war would originate from me. Should I fail, the people would not justify their ruler. Thus, when arms are used, one must resist with endurance, persist with patience, and not exploit the people violently—then victory is certain.\n\nMy words are easy to know, easy to practice.\nYet none in the world can know them, none can practice them.\n\nWords have their root; actions have their master.\nOnly because of ignorance does the world fail to know me.\nFew know me, and thus I am honored.\nTherefore, the Sage wears coarse cloth while cherishing jade.\n\nThe Great Dao is easy to know, easy to practice—\nYet also difficult to know, difficult to practice.\nWhat is called \"easy to know\" is:\nNo Dao to speak of, no learning to pursue,\nNo action to take, no affairs to attend—\nHow could it not be easy to know, easy to practice?\n\nYet the Ultimate Way cannot be spoken of—\nFor words are all false.\nLearning cannot be learned—\nFor the moment the mind moves, it is already false.\n\"Doing without doing\"—\nYet the one who remains still may not truly be so.\n\"Acting without acting\"—\nYet the one who busies himself all day may not truly be idle.\nThis is why it is difficult—\nAnd why none in the world can know or practice it.\n\nThe Sage’s words have their root; his actions have their master.\nThus, what is spoken here may have its meaning elsewhere;\nWhat is done may seem right, yet the heart differs.\nTo know the root of words is to see their differences clearly;\nTo know the master of actions is to judge their differences without doubt.\n\nOnly because people are ignorant do they fail to know me.\nOnly because they do not know me am I honored.\nIf my knowledge were no different from theirs,\nThen my worth would not be distinguished.\n\n**Chapter 71: Knowing the Unknown**\nTo know the unknown is supreme;\nTo not know the known is sickness.\nOnly by recognizing sickness as sickness\nDoes one avoid it.\nThe Sage does not fall ill\nBecause he recognizes sickness as sickness—\nThus he does not fall ill.\nThe wise chase after things,\nSo they accumulate falsehood.\nThe ignorant return to the root,\nSo they approach truth.\nIf one can recognize that not knowing is near truth,\nAnd that knowing is full of falsehood,\nThen he is supreme.\n\nIf one does not recognize knowing as falsehood\nBut instead only increases his knowledge,\nThen he uses sickness as medicine—\nAnd his sickness is beyond measure.\nOnly by recognizing knowing as sickness\nDoes one avoid it.\nThis is how the Sage does not fall ill—\nBecause he knows it.\n\n**Chapter 72: The People Do Not Fear Authority**\nIf the people do not fear authority,\nThen true authority will arise.\nDo not confine their dwelling,\nDo not exhaust their livelihood.\nOnly because they are not exhausted\nAre they not exhausted.\nThus the Sage knows himself but does not reveal himself,\nLoves himself but does not exalt himself.\nHence, he discards that and takes this.\n\nThose who seek to make others fear and love them\nAre all inwardly lacking yet outwardly covetous.\nThe Sage is complete within,\nSo others’ joy does not benefit him,\nAnd their lack of fear does not harm him—\nThus he remains detached from all.\n\nIt is easy to make others fear me,\nBut difficult to make them not fear me.\nIt is easy to make me forget others,\nBut difficult to make the world forget me.\nIf the people do not fear authority,\nIt is because none in the world forgets me.\nIs this not what is called the威 of virtue and Dao?\n\nThe Sage’s encounter with things\nFollows their nature and finds ease.\nThus he does not confine their dwelling,\nNor exhaust their livelihood.\nFor what they dwell in and live on\nAre not their true selves.\nI alone am self-exhausted,\nSo none exhausts my life.\nThis is because I know myself yet do not reveal my knowing,\nLove myself yet do not exalt my love.\nIf I had a heart of self-revelation and self-exaltation,\nThen I would confine my dwelling,\nExhaust my livelihood—\nAnd could not endure even a day.\n\n**Chapter 73: Courage in Daring and Not Daring**\nCourage in daring leads to killing;\nCourage in not daring leads to life.\nThese two—one beneficial, one harmful—\nAre what Heaven detests.\nWho knows their reason?\n\nThus even the Sage finds them difficult.\nThe Way of Heaven\nConquers without contention, yet is effortless;\nResponds without striving, yet is timely.\nComes without being summoned, yet is well-planned.\nThe Heavenly net is vast—\nWide yet never loses a thread.\n\nAll know courage in daring,\nBut none know courage in not daring.\nCourage in daring is to tread upon white blades;\nCourage in not daring is to tread the Middle Way.\nThus it is said:\nWhite blades may be trodden,\nBut the Middle Way cannot be attained.\n\nComparing the two—\nTreading white blades brings harm, yet men lightly esteem its harm;\nTreading the Middle Way brings benefit, yet men do not know its benefit.\nThis is why the Middle Way is difficult.\n\nLightness in using courage is what men envy.\nWhat Heaven detests—\nWho knows its reason?\nEven the Sage finds it difficult—\nHow much more so the common people?\n\nFor the Way of Heaven\nConquers without contention, yet is effortless;\nSpeaks without words, yet is responsive;\nComes without being summoned, yet is well-planned.\nYet it especially detests the use of courage.\n\nMen, knowing that Heaven has not yet conquered,\nThat Heaven has not yet responded,\nThat its coming has not yet arrived,\nThat its planning is not yet fixed,\nSpeak boldly—\nAnd sometimes the strong prevail, the brave win.\nBut observe it later, and then you will know:\nThe Heavenly net is vast—\nWide yet never loses a thread.\n\n**Chapter 74: The People Do Not Fear Death**\nIf the people do not fear death,\nHow can you frighten them with death?\nIf you make the people always fear death,\nAnd execute those who act strangely,\nWho dares?\nThere are always officials who execute.\nHe who substitutes for the executioner\nIs called one who takes the place of the master carpenter to wield the axe.\n\nHe who substitutes for the executioner—\nFew escape uninjured hands.\n\nThis chapter speaks of how the world’s punishments are insufficient to rely upon for governance.\n\nIf the people do not fear death,\nHow can I frighten them with death?\nIf I make the people truly fear death,\nAnd seize and kill those who act strangely,\nThen killing one man would suffice for governance.\nYet the more one kills, the more ungovernable it becomes—\nThus, punishments are insufficient to rely upon.\n\nThe Qin enforced strict laws, their nets tight,\nYet their crimes were unchecked.\nThe Han relaxed their laws, their nets let through fish as large as boats,\nYet the world turned to the Han.\nThis too is evident.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven rewards virtue and punishes licentiousness—\nThose who execute, in the unseen, cannot escape.\nIf one insists on substituting for the executioner,\nLike one who takes the place of the master carpenter to wield the axe,\nThere has never been one who did not injure his hand.\n\n**Chapter 75: The People’s Hunger**\nThe people’s hunger stems from their rulers’ excessive taxation.\nThe people’s difficulty in governing arises from their rulers’ interference—\nThus, they are difficult to govern.\nThe people’s indifference to death comes from their rulers’ lavish living—\nThus, they treat death lightly.\nOnly those who do not cling to life are wiser than those who prize it.\nThe more the ruler takes, the poorer the people become;\nThe more the ruler acts, the more the people are disordered—\nThis is inevitable.\nIf I seek to enrich their lives,\nYet disregard their lives,\nIf I am rich while they are poor,\nHow can they not treat death lightly?\nThe Sage regards life as a necessity.\nHow could he enrich his own life while depriving others of theirs?\nThis is called wiser than valuing life.\n\n**Chapter 76: On Human Life**\nHuman life is soft and weak,\nYet death is hard and strong.\nAll things—grasses and trees—\nAre soft and fragile when alive,\nYet wither and decay when dead.\nThus, the strong and rigid are the companions of death,\nWhile the soft and weak are the companions of life.\nTherefore, armies that are strong do not conquer,\nTrees that are rigid snap,\nThe strong and great are beneath,\nThe soft and weak are above.\nThis chapter broadly speaks of how the soft and weak must live,\nAnd the rigid and strong must die.\nThough softness and weakness are not the Dao itself,\nThey approach *wuwei* (non-action).\nThough rigidity and strength have not strayed from the Dao,\nThey verge on *youwei* (action).\n*Wuwei* does not stray far from the Dao,\nBut *youwei* brings fortune and misfortune, regret and blame—\nThus, it strays further from the Dao.\n\n**Chapter 77: The Dao of Heaven**\nThe Dao of Heaven—\nIs it not like drawing a bow?\nThe high are lowered, the low are raised,\nThe excessive are diminished, the deficient are supplemented.\nThe Dao of Heaven supplements the deficient and diminishes the excessive.\nBut the Dao of humanity is not so.\nIt diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive.\nWho can use their excess to nourish the world?\nOnly the Sage.\nThus, the Sage acts yet does not rely upon it,\nCompletes his work yet does not dwell upon it,\nDoes not desire to be seen as virtuous.\nTo take from the many to benefit the few—\nThis is the Dao of Heaven.\nTo take from the few to benefit the many—\nThis is the Dao of humanity.\nOnly the Sage can further use his own excess to nourish others’ deficiencies,\nThus, his power extends to all things without relying on his power,\nHis achievements cover the world yet he does not claim them,\nHis benefits flow to the world yet he does not boast of his virtue—\nOnly the Sage can do this.\n\n**Chapter 78: The World’s Softness and Weakness**\nNothing in the world is softer or weaker than water,\nYet nothing can surpass it in overcoming the rigid and strong.\nIt has no equal.\nThe weak overcoming the strong,\nThe soft overcoming the rigid—\nAll know this, yet none can practice it.\nThus, the Sage says:\n*\"To bear the nation’s filth is to be its sovereign.\"*\n*\"To bear the nation’s misfortunes is to be its king.\"*\nWater has no sentiment,\nYet it overcomes the rigid with its softness—\nHow much more so for things with sentiment?\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"You, all the myriad regions, have guilt—\nIt lies with me alone.\nMy guilt alone—\nDo not involve the myriad regions.\"*\nThe Three Dynasties once governed the people with this virtue.\nThis is called bearing the nation’s filth,\nBearing the nation’s misfortunes.\n\n**Chapter 79: Reconciling Great Grievances**\nTo reconcile great grievances will only leave lingering grievances—\nHow can this be considered good?\nThus, the Sage holds only the left contract,\nAnd does not demand repayment from others.\nTherefore, those with virtue oversee the contracts,\nThose without oversee the reckoning.\nThe Dao of Heaven favors none—\nIt always sides with the virtuous.\nGrievances cannot be reconciled,\nJust as fire cannot be cooled,\nOr water cannot be heated.\nIf one forces reconciliation,\nThere will surely be lingering grievances.\nTo consider this good is insufficient.\nThus, the Sage governs the world\nAs one who holds the left contract and seeks only the left contract—\nWhere do my favors and grievances come from?\nIt is like the matching of contracts and seals—\nIf they do not fit, one does not force what is not there,\nNor does one demand what is not owed.\nThe Sage’s governance of the world\nIs like the overseer of contracts seeking perfect alignment—\nGreat or small, long or short—\nHe knows the contracts will fit on their own,\nYet he harbors no private bias.\nIf one insists on forcing a match,\nThat is the overseer of reckonings, not of contracts.\nThe Dao of Heaven is the same.\nThe Dao of Heaven favors none—\nIt never fails to reward the virtuous—\nFor it is merely the overseer of contracts.\n\n**Chapter 80: Small States, Few People**\nIn small states with few people,\nLet there be ten or a hundred skilled craftsmen, yet they are unused.\nLet the people value life so much that they do not migrate far.\nThough there are boats and carriages, they have no use for them.\nThough there are arms and armor, they have no place to display them.\nLet the people return to knotted cords for record-keeping.\nLet their food be savory, their clothing beautiful,\nTheir dwellings secure, their customs joyful.\nNeighboring states are visible, the sounds of roosters and dogs are heard,\nYet the people die of old age without ever traveling to one another.\n\nIn small states with few people,\nThe talents of ten or a hundred are employed.\nIf the talents of ten or a hundred are employed,\nThen great talents are discarded.\nIf the people hold life lightly,\nThey will migrate far without hesitation—\nIf they migrate without hesitation, they will do whatever they please.\nIf there are ten or a hundred skilled craftsmen yet they are unused,\nIf the people cherish life and do not migrate far,\nThen though there are boats and carriages, they have no use for them,\nThough there are arms and armor, they have no place to display them,\nYet governance can return to knotted cords—\nThis too is acceptable.\n\n「Let the people each find contentment in their own food, delight in their own attire,\nAnd each find security in their own dwelling—\nThough neighbors may be seen and heard,\nThey will not travel to one another,\nUnless their clothing and food are sufficient and their desires few,\nThen only may such a state be achieved.\n\n**Chapter Eighty-One: Trustworthy Speech is Not Florid**\nTrustworthy speech need not be florid,\nFlorid speech need not be trustworthy.\nThe virtuous do not argue,\nThose who argue are not virtuous.\nThe wise do not amass knowledge,\nThose who amass knowledge are not wise.\nThe sagely do not hoard—\nWhen they give to others, they grow ever more abundant,\nWhen they share with others, they grow ever more rich.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven benefits without harming,\nThe Dao of the Sage acts without striving.\nThose whose words are trustworthy need not be florid,\nFlorid words need not be trustworthy.\nThose whose words are virtuous need not be eloquent,\nEloquent words need not be virtuous.\nThose whose knowledge is true need not be vast,\nVast knowledge need not be true.\nThe Sage, in the Way,\nHolds no grudging heart—\nNot a hair’s breadth of stinginess.\nOnly the shallow and narrow-minded,\nIn their own shallow and narrow ways,\nDoubt others as untrustworthy, unvirtuous, unwise—\nOr drown in florid speech,\nOr bewildered by eloquence,\nOr lost in vast knowledge,\nAll unable to gain true understanding.\n\nHow could they know?\nThe Sage’s Dao is vast as the sea—\nGiving without hoarding,\nWhen he benefits others, he grows ever more abundant,\nWhen he shares with others, he grows ever more rich.\nI lament the world’s people for their small capacity,\nTheir narrow demands,\nUnworthy of my giving.\n\nJust as Heaven is—\nBenefiting all without harming,\nAnd all not striving against it.\nThus it is said of *Qián* (乾):\nAt its beginning, it could make all things beautiful and beneficial,\nYet spoke not of what it benefited—\nGreat indeed is its power!\n\n**End of Volume Four of *The True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue* #1**\n*\"Rán néng jiù wù\"*—\n*\"Rán\"* (然) is likely missing the character *\"hòu\"*

True Scripture of Dao and Virtue*\n**Author:** Li Jiamou of the Song Dynasty\n**Four Scrolls**\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity* (Cavernous Spirit Division, Jade Explications Category)\n**Collated Edition:** *Essentials of the Daoist Canon*, First Category\n\n---\n\n**Scroll One**\n*Explication by the Recluse of Restful Studio*\n*Dao Scripture, Part One*\n\n**Chapter One: \"The Dao That Can Be Spoken\"**\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal name.\nNameless, it is the origin of heaven and earth;\nNamed, it is the mother of the myriad things.\nEver desireless, one observes its mystery;\nEver desiring, one observes its manifestations.\nThese two emerge together yet bear different names.\nTogether they are called the profound.\nProfound and yet more profound—\nThe gateway to all mysteries.\n\n\"Eternal\" denotes that which does not change.\nThings may transform, but the Dao does not.\nThe transformations of things shift moment by moment,\nNever pausing even for an instant.\nYet the Dao itself is without beginning or end;\nHeaven and earth may perish, but this Dao is inexhaustible.\nThis is what is called \"eternal.\"\nAs the eternal Dao, it cannot be attained through action,\nNor grasped through naming.\nIf it could be attained through action, it would not be the eternal Dao.\nIf it could be grasped through naming, it would not be the eternal name.\nBefore the inception of heaven and earth,\nThe principle of true constancy already resided in the nameless origin.\nThus, the nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth.\nOnce heaven and earth were sundered, names arose,\nAnd from these, the myriad things proliferated.\nThus, that which can be named is the mother of things.\n\nThe sage embodies the true and constant Dao,\nMoving between being and non-being.\nThe \"mystery\" is the great Dao, the non-being;\nThe \"manifestation\" is the lesser Dao, the being.\nWhen I wish to observe its mystery,\nI enter into the mystery and return to non-being.\nWhen I wish to observe its manifestation,\nI emerge with the manifestation and wander in being.\nMystery is the subtlety of manifestation;\nManifestation is the subtlety of mystery.\nBeing is emptiness;\nEmptiness is being.\nTheir root is the same, though their branches differ.\nThus, together they are called the profound.\nYet it is not only this—\nThe profound within the profound\nEnables all manifestations to be nothing but mysteries.\nThis is the gateway to all mysteries,\nFor within the subtleties of being and non-being,\nAll is refined and transformed into mystery.\n\n**Chapter Two: \"When All Under Heaven Know\"**\nWhen all under heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises.\nWhen all know goodness as goodness, not-goodness arises.\nThus, being and non-being produce each other;\nDifficult and easy complete each other;\nLong and short shape each other;\nHigh and low incline toward each other;\nSound and voice harmonize with each other;\nFront and back follow each other.\nTherefore, the sage abides in non-action,\nPractices the teaching without words,\nAllows the myriad things to arise without hindrance,\nGives life without possessing,\nActs without relying,\nAccomplishes without dwelling.\nOnly because he does not dwell\nDoes it not depart from him.\n\nThe five thousand words of *Laozi*\nAbove may penetrate the mystery,\nBelow may penetrate the manifestation.\nThrough them, one attains the Dao;\nThrough them, one governs the state;\nThrough them, one cultivates the self.\nTheir words consistently apply to these three,\nWhich is why they are subtle, mysterious, and profoundly unfathomable.\n\nThis chapter speaks of our original nature,\nWhich, before the existence of things,\nKnew neither beauty nor ugliness, neither goodness nor not-goodness.\nOnce existence was established and forms and names were distinguished,\nPeople knew beauty as beauty,\nYet did not realize that the name of ugliness arose from beauty.\nPeople knew goodness as goodness,\nYet did not realize that the name of not-goodness arose from goodness.\nFor in all things under heaven,\nNothing exists without its opposite.\nBeing and non-being produce each other;\nDifficult and easy complete each other;\nLong and short shape each other;\nHigh and low incline toward each other;\nSound and voice harmonize with each other;\nFront and back follow each other—\nWhere there is one, there cannot fail to be the other.\nThe sage, knowing this,\nMust stand before things and follow their natural course.\nEngaging in non-action,\nPracticing the teaching without words,\nNeither grasping goodness nor rejecting ugliness,\nNever clinging to one, yet never without unity,\nActing all day without acting,\nSpeaking all day without speaking—\nThus, when the myriad things arise, I arise with them.\nArising without hindrance,\nWhen the myriad things live, I live with them.\nGiving life without possessing,\nFor in acting, it is not my action but merely following things.\nThus, I act without reliance.\nWhen there is accomplishment, it is not my accomplishment but merely responding to things.\nThus, I accomplish without dwelling.\nBy not dwelling in the end but dwelling in the beginning,\nThat which I dwell in cannot be taken away,\nAnd so things cannot depart from it.\n\n**Chapter Three: \"Not Exalting the Worthy\"**\nNot exalting the worthy prevents the people from contending.\nNot prizing rare goods prevents the people from stealing.\nNot displaying what is desirable prevents the heart from confusion.\nThus, in the sage’s governance,\nHe empties their hearts,\nFills their bellies,\nWeakens their ambitions,\nStrengthens their bones,\nEver keeping the people without knowledge and without desire.\nHe ensures that the knowledgeable dare not act.\nEngaging in non-action, there is nothing left ungverned.\n\nTo be proud or boastful is to exalt the worthy.\nTo cherish or acquire is to prize rare goods.\nTo perceive or be drawn to beauty is to display what is desirable.\nSpeaking of the body alone:\nThe heart is the ruler; the ears, eyes, nose, mouth, limbs, and members are the people.\nWhat the superior loves, the inferior will exaggerate.\nIf I set pride and boasting before the people,\nThe people will each boast of their abilities.\nBoasting without end, their contention will inevitably arise.\nIf I set cherishing and acquiring before the people,\nThe people will each take what they desire.\nTaking without cease, their thievery will inevitably arise.\nIf I make desire my heart,\nCraving will know no bounds.\nWhatever appears before me, whatever moves my eyes,\nI will desire to obtain—\nAnd thus, confusion will inevitably arise.",

Heavenly Dao.\nThe sage follows Heaven and not the human;\nthe multitude follows the human and not Heaven.\nWhat is meant by \"following Heaven and not the human\"?\nThe heart is like the belly, the will like the bones.\nAs the saying goes: *\"Would that the petty man’s belly were the noble man’s heart!\"*—it would be nothing more than steadfast integrity.\nFor the belly is easily satisfied, while the heart is never satisfied.\nThe sage, abiding in Heaven, is full as the belly, firm as the bones—\nnone know how he is full, yet he is full;\nnone know how he is firm, yet he is firm.\nBeing both full and firm,\nthe heart is empty without striving for emptiness,\nthe will is weak without striving for weakness.\nThe multitude is not so:\nthey cling to the human and not to Heaven.\nThus, in contention and grasping, their hearts and wills grow strong within.\nWhen the heart is wild, craving arises;\nthe more they take, the more they lack—\nthis is the belly never filled.\nWhen the will is full, indolence follows;\nindolence leads to insufficiency—\nthis is the bones never strengthened.\nThe sage, guarding within with clarity,\nis unmoved by externals,\nthus making the people without knowledge and without desire.\nFor where there is knowledge, there is inevitably mixture;\nwhere there is thought, there is inevitably deviation—\nthis is inescapable for all things.\nThe sage knows that knowledge is not mixed, thought is not deviant.\nI can know, yet knowing that knowledge cannot be master,\nthis is called *\"the knower does not act.\"*\nWhat is known is true,\nwhat is done is not disordered.\nThus, knowledge is without knowledge,\naction is without action.\nApplying this to the state or to the self,\nthere is nothing that is not well-ordered.\n\n**Chapter 4: The Dao’s Profundity**\nThe Dao is profound and ever-flowing,\nits use never full.\nAbysmal, it seems the ancestor of the myriad things.\nBlunting its sharpness,\nuntangling its knots,\nsoftening its glare,\nmerging with the dust—\ndeep and serene, it seems to exist.\nI know not whose child it is,\nit seems prior to the Lord of Heaven.\n\nThe Dao is profoundly empty and wondrous;\npressed to grasp it, it seems unattainable.\nThus it is said: *\"its use never full.\"*\nYet the deeper its mystery, the more it is used without exhaustion.\nEach thing follows the Dao, yet the Dao never becomes a thing.\nThus it is said: *\"it seems the ancestor of the myriad things.\"*\n\nThe ancients who studied the Dao\nnever set their minds on advancement or achievement.\nTo blunt its sharpness is not to act willfully—\nthey never feared what they did not do.\nTo untangle its knots is to act without omission—\nthey never sought goodness as beauty.\nTo soften its glare is not to seek goodness—\nthey never despised evil as wrong.\nTo merge with the dust is not to reject evil—\nserene, they abided without abiding in serenity.\nThus it seems to exist.\nI know not its beginning,\nthus I know not whose child it is.\nI know not what precedes it,\nthus it seems prior to the Lord of Heaven.\n\n**Chapter 5: Heaven and Earth Are Not Benevolent**\nHeaven and Earth are not benevolent;\nthey treat the myriad things as straw dogs.\nThe sage is not benevolent;\nhe treats the people as straw dogs.\nThe space between Heaven and Earth—\nis it not like a bellows?\nEmpty yet inexhaustible,\nthe more it moves, the more it yields.\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion;\nbetter to guard the center.\n\nGreat benevolence is not partial,\nthough it may seem not to favor, its benevolence is all-pervading.\nSmall benevolence favors the near,\nthough it may seem to favor, its benevolence is not all-pervading.\nThus, Heaven and Earth do not favor each thing with partiality,\nnor love each person as themselves.\nLike straw dogs used in sacrifice,\nthey are neither used nor discarded,\nneither valued nor despised—\nthey regard things as straw dogs,\nand regard themselves as a bellows.\n\nEmpty yet inexhaustible,\nthe more it moves, the more it yields.\nThe bellows does not know it generates wind,\nnor does the wind know it arises from the bellows—\nthus the more it moves, the more inexhaustible it becomes.\nIf one insists on benevolence to favor things,\nbenevolence will not be all-pervading.\nIf one does not respond with emptiness,\nthe response will not be complete.\nNow, to seek words with words\nis already to risk exhaustion—\nhow much more to observe the myriad things with a single self?\nBetter to guard the center within,\nspeaking only when the time is right.\nI know not what is said,\nthus words fill the world without fault.\n\n**Chapter 6: The Valley Spirit Never Dies**\nThe valley spirit never dies—\nthis is called the Mysterious Female.\nThe gate of the Mysterious Female\nis called the root of Heaven and Earth.\nSubtle and enduring, it seems to exist;\nits use is never exhausted.\n\nThe spirit is concealed in the body,\nlike a valley hidden in a mountain—\nthus it is said: *\"the valley spirit.\"*\nThe valley is empty, yet its function is fullness;\nfullness arises from emptiness.\nThe valley spirit has no form,\ndwelling in the formed yet never dying—\nlike its nourishment by the Mysterious Female.\nThe *Mysterious* is Heaven, in man it is the nose.\nThe *Female* is Earth, in man it is the mouth.\nThe nose, empty, receives Heaven’s *qi*;\nthe mouth, empty, consumes Earth’s essence.\nThus, the gate of the Mysterious Female\nis the passage of essence and *qi*—\nman’s immortality lies in his root in Heaven and Earth.\nIf one knows its regulation,\nfollowing its nature,\nusing non-use,\nalways keeping it subtle and enduring like the valley’s emptiness—\nthen the spirit moves and Heaven responds,\nnothing fails to answer.\n\n**Chapter 7: Heaven and Earth Are Everlasting**\nHeaven and Earth are everlasting.\nThe reason Heaven and Earth endure so long\nis that they do not live for themselves—\nthus they can live long.\nTherefore the sage places himself last and finds himself first,\nsets himself aside and finds himself preserved.\nIs it not because he is selfless?\nThus he can fulfill his self.\n\nHeaven bestows, Earth produces—\nthe Dao of bestowing and producing lies in Heaven and Earth.\nThey never abandon the field for a day;\ntheir bestowal is unceasing,\ntheir production unfathomable.\nHeaven never loves its bestowal,\nEarth never rests its production—\nthis is called *\"not living for themselves.\"*\nBecause they do not live for themselves,\nthe myriad things rely on them to live—\nthus they can live long.\nThe sage is the same.\nKnowing this heart is unchanging and indestructible,\nvast and flowing with Heaven and Earth,\nhe finds nothing in this body to cling to.\nThe movement of this single heart\nknows no action that is not done;\nin every gesture, nothing is not good and beneficial—\nlike what he attains,\nhe takes non-self as self.\nThus, of all under Heaven who have a self, none compare to him.",

Dao of Heaven.\n\nKnowing its fullness yet holding it\nis not as good as never having been full.\nKnowing its sharpness yet honing it\nis not as good as never having been sharp.\nTo know fullness yet hold it,\nto know sharpness yet hone it—\nthis is already not good,\nhow much worse for those who are full yet do not hold,\nsharp yet do not hone?\nFullness leading to greater greed,\nsharpness leading to greater arrogance,\ngold and jade filling the hall without knowing when to stop,\nwealth and honor with arrogance—\nunable to make things arrogant,\none first loses one’s own heart—\nthis is called *\"bringing one’s own calamity.\"*\n\nThe movement of the four seasons:\nwhen merit is achieved, one retreats—\nthe Dao of Heaven is like this,\nhow much more for humans?\n\n**Chapter Ten: Carrying the Spiritual and Embracing the One**\nIn carrying the spiritual and embracing the One,\ncan you never part from it?\nIn concentrating qi to attain softness,\ncan you be like an infant?\nIn cleansing and purifying profound vision,\ncan you be without flaw?\nIn loving the people and governing the state,\ncan you practice non-action?\nIn the opening and closing of the Heavenly Gate,\ncan you play the female?\nIn clarity and thorough understanding,\ncan you be without knowledge?\n\nGiving life and nurturing,\ngiving life yet not possessing,\nacting yet not relying,\ngrowing yet not ruling—\nthis is called *\"profound virtue.\"*\n\n*\"Carrying\"* means beginning.\n*\"Spiritual\"* means creating.\nThe *hun* is human yang.\nThe *po* is human yin.\nFrom the beginning of creation, the *po* embraces the *hun*—\ncan you make the *hun* and *po* embrace,\nunited as one and never parting?\n\nThe infant’s yang qi is not yet dispersed,\ninner harmony is soft—\nthis is not the infant’s ability,\nbut the effect of concentrating qi.\nWithout aiming to attain, it attains—\nthus concentrating qi brings harmony,\nunited as one and without admixture—\ncan you be like a child?\n\nIn transcendent profound vision,\nthere is nothing not good,\nyet if this heart is not forgotten,\nit is insufficient to speak of the Dao—\nthus can you cleanse and purify profound vision,\nmaking it without flaw?\n\nLoving the people with love,\nlove is never complete.\nGoverning the state with affairs,\nthe state is never well-governed.\nIn purity and stillness, facing the people,\nthe people will transform themselves—\nthus can you practice non-action?\n\nYang moves and opens,\nyin is still and closes—\none opening, one closing,\nfrom which transformations emerge.\nYet ceaseless movement must reach exhaustion;\nmovement followed by closing,\nguarding stillness to nurture movement—\nthus can you play the female?\n\nInwardly and outwardly clear,\nthe center thoroughly illuminated—\nthough not engaging in affairs,\none is still burdened by the dust of stillness.\nOnly by knowing the self as no-self\ncan one know that nothing is an obstacle—\nthus can you be without knowledge?\n\nThe sage gives life to things as a parent,\nnurtures them as descendants—\nyet gives life without taking as possession,\nacts without relying on merit,\ngrows without claiming mastery—\nwithout embodying profound virtue, this cannot be.\n\n**Chapter Eleven: The Thirty Spokes**\nThirty spokes share one hub—\nit is where there is nothing that the usefulness of the cart lies.\nClay is molded to make a vessel—\nit is where there is nothing that the usefulness of the vessel lies.\nDoors and windows are cut to make a room—\nit is where there is nothing that the usefulness of the room lies.\nThus, *\"having\"* is for the sake of benefit,\n*\"nothing\"* is for the sake of use.\n\nThe body is *\"having,\"*\nthe spirit is *\"nothing\"*—\nthe spirit is concealed in the body,\nusing emptiness to employ fullness.\nThus the ear, without emptiness, cannot hear;\nthe eye, without emptiness, cannot see;\nthe nose, without emptiness, cannot smell;\nthe mouth, without emptiness, cannot receive;\nthe body, without emptiness, cannot touch.\nThus benefit may lie in fullness,\nbut use lies in emptiness.\n\nLike thirty spokes forming a hub—\nwithout emptiness, the hub cannot turn.\nClay molded to make a vessel—\nwithout emptiness, the vessel cannot contain.\nDoors and windows cut to make a room—\nwithout emptiness, the room cannot be bright.\nEars, eyes, nose, and mouth gather to form the body—\nyet without emptiness, the five senses cannot function;\nwithout emptiness, the spirit cannot dwell.\nThe use of emptiness—\nhow great it is!\n\n**Chapter Twelve: The Five Colors**\nThe five colors blind the eyes,\nthe five tones deafen the ears,\nthe five flavors dull the mouth,\ngalloping and hunting madden the heart,\nrare goods hinder conduct.\nThus the sage is for the belly, not for the eyes—\ntherefore he discards that and takes this.",
      "overlap_context": "*\nBecause they do not live for themselves,\nthe myriad things rely on them to live—\nthus they can live long.\nThe sage is the same.\nKnowing this heart is unchanging and indestructible,\nvast and flowing with Heaven and Earth,\nhe finds nothing in this body to cling to.\nThe movement of this single heart\nknows no action that is not done;\nin every gesture, nothing is not good and beneficial—\nlike what he attains,\nhe takes non-self as self.\nThus, of all under Heaven who have a self, none compare to him.",

sound seizes hearing.\nIf tasting stops at flavor,\nthen flavor seizes the mouth.\nIf the heart stops at grasping,\nthen grasping seizes the heart.\n\nWhen these four are seized by things,\nthe eye is

brings alarm,\nhence “favor and disgrace are like alarm.”\nWhat is meant by “valuing great trouble as one’s own body”?\nThe reason I have great trouble\nis that I have a body.\nIf I had no body,\nwhat

world.\n\nWhat is meant by “favor and disgrace are like alarm”?\nThe *Doctrine of the Mean* says:\n“The noble person acts according to their station,\nwithout desiring what lies beyond it.\nIn wealth and honor, they act as one in wealth and honor;\nin poverty and lowliness, they act as one in poverty and lowliness.”\nThus the noble person finds contentment in every situation.\nFavor and disgrace are not one’s true station—\ngaining favor brings alarm,\nfearing the disgrace to come;\nlosing disgrace brings alarm,\nfearing the favor that may arrive.\nThus one fears favor as one fears disgrace,\ngains favor as one gains disgrace.\nHence it is said, “Disgrace is lowly.”\nFor one knows both come from without.\n\nWhat is meant by “valuing great trouble as one’s own body”?\n*Mencius* says:\n“A state without loyal ministers at home\nor rival states abroad will perish.”\nYet trouble arises from having a body—\nif I had no body,\nwhat trouble would there be?\nThe body cannot be without thought,\nfor without thought, great trouble arises.\nIf one must have trouble, think how to avoid it—\nthen the body will not be lost.\nOnly by valuing great trouble as one values one’s body\ncan one avoid trouble.\nNot only this—\ntherefore, one who values the world as one’s own body\nmay be entrusted with the world;\none who loves the world as one’s own body\nmay be relied upon with the world.\nFor only by treating the world’s troubles as one’s own\ncan one preserve the state.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: The Unseen**\nLook and it cannot be seen—\nthis is called *yí*.\nListen and

form, or shape,\nwhat is called “original clarity”\nis but a single pure brightness.\nBefore it scatters, it merges into one—\nthough it abides in brightness, it cannot be called bright.\nThus it is said, “Above, it is not bright.”\nThough it cannot be called bright,\nit also cannot be called dark.\nThus it is said, “Below, it is not dark.”\nIt has never been separate or apart,\nhence “endless, unnameable.”\nThough it returns to nothingness,\nit cannot be called nothingness.\nThus it is called the formless form,\nthe imageless image—\nthis is called the indistinct and vague.\nThe indistinct

is the distance?\nBetween good and evil, what is the difference?\nWhat others fear, one cannot but fear—\nhow vast and boundless it remains!\n\nThe multitude bustles and rejoices,\nas if feasting at a grand sacrifice,\nas if ascending a springtime terrace.\nI alone remain unmoved, without sign,\nlike an infant who has not yet learned to smile.\nAdrift, as if with no place to return.\nThe multitude all have more than enough,\nI alone seem bereft.\nWhat a fool’s heart I possess—so simple and pure!\n\nThe common folk shine bright,\nI alone appear dim.\nThe common folk are sharp and discerning,\nI alone am dull and obscure.\nVast as the sea, drifting without cease,\nas if nowhere to rest.\nThe multitude all have their uses,\nI alone am stubborn and coarse.\nI alone differ from others,\nyet I value feeding from the Mother.\n\nIf learning does not reach nothingness,\nwhat is learned is not true learning.\nThe Dao takes non-attainment as attainment;\nlearning takes non-learning as learning.\nIf the Dao could be attained,\nit would be mere benevolence and righteousness.\nIf learning could be learned,\nit would be mere names and calculations.\nThus the sage takes non-attainment as attaining the Dao,\nand non-learning as true learning.\nHence it is said: \"Abandoning learning brings no sorrow.\"\nIf one has not yet reached non-learning,\nthen the world’s learning is endless—\ngrasping one thing, losing another,\ngaining here, losing there,\none must rejoice in gain and sorrow in loss,\nnever at rest.\n\nThe root of the Dao,\nviewed from its origin,\nhas never differed.\nIf one does not grasp the root but seeks to equal the branches,\nthe branches will surely diverge greatly.\n\"Yea\" is reverent, \"ah\" is careless—\nyet between \"yea\" and \"ah,\"\nhow great is the distance?\nBut when it becomes reverence or carelessness,\nthe distance grows vast.\nFacing principle is good, turning from it is evil—\nyet between facing and turning,\nhow great is the difference?\nBut when it becomes good or evil,\nthe distance grows vast.\nThe sage observes beginnings,\nknowing their roots are the same,\nthus turning carelessness into reverence,\nevil into good,\nin but a moment.\nIf one knows that \"yea\" and \"ah,\" good and evil,\nshare the same root,\nthen attaining true learning is not difficult.\nYet when the sage emerges to respond to the world,\nhow can he easily change what the age desires\nto follow his own desires,\nor make the world’s views conform to his own?\n\nWhat others delight in, I too delight in;\nwhat others fear, I too fear.\nBut what sets me apart from the multitude\nis that they indulge in boundless joy,\nrejoicing as if ascending a spring terrace,\nfeasting as if at a grand sacrifice,\ntheir brightness shining forth,\nclaiming none surpass them,\ntheir wisdom sharp and clear,\nclaiming none exceed them.\nTruly, they believe their joy is joy,\ntheir beauty is beauty,\ntheir brightness is brightness,\ntheir wisdom is wisdom—\nblind to their true nature, knowing only what is real.\nThus their minds see nothing beyond the self.\n\nThe sage’s mind wanders in the Dao,\nand his response to things is not real.\nThus he remains unmoved, without sign,\nlike an infant who has not yet learned to smile,\nadrift, as if with no place to return,\nvast as the sea, drifting without cease.\nThe multitude all have more than enough,\nI alone seem bereft.\nThe multitude all have their uses,\nI alone am stubborn and coarse.\nIs this truly the heart of a fool?\nNo—what sets me apart from the multitude\nis that I recognize the root and reach the origin,\nnot flowing into the branches.\nThis is called \"valuing feeding from the Mother.\"\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One: \"The Vast Virtue’s Appearance\"**\n\nThe vast virtue’s appearance follows only the Dao.\nThe Dao as a thing is only vague and indistinct.\nIndistinct, yet within it there are images.\nVague, yet within it there are things.\nDark and deep, yet within it there is essence.\nIts essence is utterly real,\nwithin it there is sincerity.\nFrom ancient times to the present,\nits name does not fade,\nthrough which we observe the origins of all things.\nHow do I know the origins of all things?\nBy this.\n\n\"Vast\" means great.\nThe greatest virtue’s appearance is also great.\nThe Dao has never had an appearance,\nyet the vast virtue’s appearance depends on the Dao.\nThus it arises with the Dao’s arising—I know not its arising;\nit ceases with the Dao’s ceasing—I know not its ceasing.\nThe Dao as a thing is vague, indistinct, dark, and deep,\nyet within its vagueness there are images,\nwithin its indistinctness there are things,\nwithin its darkness and depth there is essence—\nthus from nothing, nothing is not present.\nWhat is present within presence,\nthe multitude take as real, not knowing that what is present has no true substance,\nand that presence reverts to absence.\nWhat is present within absence,\npeople do not know,\nnot realizing that absence reverts to presence.\nFor what is present within presence\nis the coarse aspect of presence.\nOnly what is present within absence\nis the true aspect of presence.\nOnly when it is true and not false\ndoes it neither persist through presence\nnor vanish through absence.\nThis is called \"sincerity.\"\nFrom ancient times to the present,\nunchanging and unaltered,\nits essence does not fade.\nThus the sage can observe the beginnings of all things\nand know why all things are as they are,\nfor he embodies perfect nothingness,\nand so can observe all things.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: \"Bending Brings Wholeness\"**\n\nBend and you will be whole,\ntwist and you will be straight,\nhollow and you will be full,\nworn and you will be renewed,\nhave little and you will gain,\nhave much and you will be confused.\nThus the sage embraces the One and becomes the world’s model.\nNot seeing himself, he is enlightened;\nnot asserting himself, he is distinguished;\nnot boasting, he achieves merit;\nnot exalting himself, he endures.\nIt is only because he does not contend\nthat no one in the world can contend with him.\nIs the saying \"Bend and you will be whole\" empty words?\nTruly, wholeness returns to him.\n\nThings cannot remain forever bent,\nthus bending brings wholeness.\nThings cannot remain forever twisted,\nthus twisting brings straightness.\nHollow and they must be filled,\nworn and they must be renewed,\nhaving little makes gaining easy,\nhaving much makes confusion easy—\nthis is the ultimate principle of fullness and emptiness.",

      "translated_text": "The ancient sages were able to serve as the root of all things because they embraced the One.\nTo embrace the One is to always align with the Dao, thus they do not assert themselves, but follow others’ perceptions;\nthey do not insist on their own correctness, but follow the truth in things;\nthey do not claim credit for their achievements, but let others recognize them;\nthey do not boast of their virtues, but let others acknowledge them.\nOnly by standing alone without contention do they transcend all things,\nand thus no one in the world can contend with them.\n\nThe sage follows the natural order in action—\nwater cannot fail to be whole,\nyet it remains whole by yielding to curves.\nIts wholeness is supreme.\nThis is called *truly* returning to wholeness.\n\n**Chapter 23: *Hixian Ziran* (The Rare and Natural)**\nRare speech is natural.\nA gusting wind does not last a morning,\na sudden rain does not last a day.\nWho makes it so?\nThe heavens and the earth.\nEven the heavens and the earth cannot endure long,\nhow much less can mortals?\n\nThus, those who follow the Dao:\nthose aligned with the Dao are one with the Dao,\nthose aligned with virtue are one with virtue,\nthose aligned with loss are one with loss.\nThose aligned with the Dao find the Dao rejoices in them;\nthose aligned with virtue find virtue rejoices in them;\nthose aligned with loss find loss rejoices in them.\nIf trust is insufficient, there will be distrust.\nOnly when the time is right should one speak,\nso that people do not perceive the speech.\nThis is called *rare speech, natural*.\n\nIf forced to speak, it is like gusting winds and sudden rains—\nthough it may prevail for a moment,\nit will inevitably falter.\nEven with the force of heaven and earth,\nif they do not act according to their nature,\ntheir fleeting, trembling motion cannot endure,\nhow much less can mortals?\n\nThus, those who follow the Dao never fixate on gain or loss.\nWithin them, it is naturally so—\nthey know that fundamentally, there is no gain or loss.\nWithout gain or loss, yet following the world’s gains and losses,\nsometimes gaining, sometimes losing,\nthey trust in what arises,\nand their hearts remain unburdened.\nThus, being one with the Dao is acceptable,\nbeing one with virtue is acceptable,\nbeing one with loss is acceptable.\nThose one with the Dao rejoice in their Dao,\nthose one with virtue rejoice in their virtue,\nthose one with loss rejoice in their loss—\ngain and loss alike, I do not know them.\nThis is why inner sincerity brings self-trust.\nIf trust is lacking, thoughts of gain and loss will swirl within,\nwith gains and losses alternating,\ndoubting oneself before others can trust you.\n\n**Chapter 24: *Zhi Zhe Bu Li* (The Lame Do Not Stand)**\nThe crooked do not stand,\nthe straddling do not walk.\nThose who assert themselves are not enlightened,\nthose who insist on their own correctness are not distinguished,\nthose who boast of their achievements have no merit,\nthose who exalt their virtues do not endure.\nIn the Dao, these are called *excessive food, superfluous actions*—\npeople may detest them,\nso those who follow the Dao do not dwell there.\n\nStone stands without feet,\nwind moves without feet—\nthis is because those who stand do not know they stand,\nthose who walk do not know they walk.\nFeet not reaching the ground are called *lame*,\nfeet overstepping in walking are called *straddling*.\nTo stand lame is to stand briefly,\nto walk straddling is to walk without endurance.\n\nAncient students of the Dao must be whole in heaven.\nWhen they respond to things, they do not deliberate—\nlike the hands, feet, ears, and eyes responding instinctively to the heart,\nwithout being commanded.\nIf hands, feet, ears, and eyes only act after thought,\nthen in every movement, one does not know what to do.\n\nThus, those who assert themselves are not enlightened,\nthose who insist on their own correctness are not distinguished,\nthose who boast of their achievements have no merit,\nthose who exalt their virtues do not endure—\nthis is because they have a self-centered mind.\nTo study the Dao while harboring a self-centered mind\nis to indulge in *excessive food, superfluous actions*.\n\nFood is for satisfying hunger.\nAction is for serving purpose.\nAfter hunger is sated, yet piles of meat and grain remain,\none fears not taking them away.\nActions that do not serve purpose—\neven if one has Zhongzi’s frugality or Weisheng’s faithfulness,\nthey may still be burdensome.\nThus, *excessive food and superfluous actions*—\nthese two things people may detest.\nThose who follow the Dao act according to their nature,\nso their food is not excessive,\ntheir actions are not superfluous.\n\n**Chapter 25: *Youwu Huncheng* (The Indistinct and Complete)**\nThere is a thing indistinct and complete,\nborn before heaven and earth.\nSilent and void,\nit stands alone yet does not change,\ncirculates endlessly yet never perishes.\nIt can be the mother of all things under heaven.\nI do not know its name—\nI call it the Dao.\nIf I must name it, I call it *Great*.\nGreat is called *Passing*,\nPassing is called *Distant*,\nDistant is called *Returning*.\nThus, the Dao is great,\nheaven is great,\nearth is great,\nand the king is great.\nWithin the realm, there are four greats,\nand the king occupies one of them.\n\nHumans model themselves after earth,\nearth models itself after heaven,\nheaven models itself after the Dao,\nthe Dao models itself after naturalness.\n\nTo call it *a thing* is beyond naming,\nto call it *indistinct and complete* is beyond cultivation.\nIt was born before heaven and earth,\nits beginning unseen.\nSince its beginning is unseen,\nits end is unknown.\nWithout beginning or end,\nit stands alone yet does not change.\nThough it stands alone, it never truly stands alone—\nit circulates through all things,\nentering everywhere without peril.\nAll things under heaven arise from it.\nEndlessly generating, it can be the mother of all things.\n\nYet to call it *standing alone* is not standing alone,\nto call it *circulating* is not circulating,\nto call it *mother of all things* is not mothering all things.\nI do not know its name—\nI call it the Dao,\nand if forced, I name it *Great*.\nThough called *Great*, its greatness is unseen,\nyet it transforms—thus it is called *Passing*.\nThough called *Passing*, it never truly departs,\nreaching everywhere—thus it is called *Distant*.\nThough called *Distant*, in a single thought,\nit possesses all things—thus it is called *Returning*.\nJust as it is great yet able to pass,\ndistant yet able to return,\nit is neither great nor small,\nneither distant nor near—\nall beyond naming.\nThis is called the Dao.\n\nWhen the Dao descends and gives birth to things,\nheaven and earth are divided,\nand within the realm, the

Dao**\nIf one seeks to take the world and act upon it,\nI see that it is not inevitable.\nThe world is a sacred vessel,\nunable to be forced.\n\nForcing it leads to its ruin,\ngrasping it causes its loss.\nAll things either move on their own or follow,\neither exhale warmth or inhale cold,\neither grow strong or wither weak,\neither bear weight or collapse.\nThus the sage avoids excess, avoids extravagance, avoids arrogance.\n\nThe sage embodies the Dao as his nature,\nyet only under necessity does he cherish form in the realm between heaven and earth.\nSince the world cannot be governed without the sage,\nhe must take it under necessity.\nBut the sage regards this body as a lodging,\nand the world as a lodging for his purpose—\na lodging would never force what it lacks,\nlest it lose the true Dao of *constant virtue*.\n\nThose who do not know the Dao regard the world as a concrete possession,\nand when they assume lordship over it,\nthey wield it as a means to bend others,\nto seize things,\nyet they do not realize that their very actions\nwill instead lead to its ruin,\nand their very grasping\nwill instead cause its loss.\n\nIndeed, things in the world\neither move on their own or must be followed,\neither exhale warmth when breathed upon or inhale cold when blown,\neither grow strong and robust or wither and decay,\neither bear weight when entrusted or collapse when overburdened.\nThe non-uniformity of things is their natural condition.\nIf one insists on forcing them or seizing them,\nmaking the self-moving follow,\nthe exhaling inhale cold,\nthe strong wither weak,\nand the bearing collapse—\nthen even heaven would find it impossible,\nhow much more so humanity?\n\nThe sage follows their natural course,\nknowing their inherent limitations.\nSome things cannot be altered,\nbut he removes their excesses,\ntheir extravagances,\ntheir arrogances,\nso that those which can move or exhale warmth,\ncan grow strong or bear weight,\ndo not overreach—\nwhile those which must follow or inhale cold,\nwither weak or collapse,\ndo not fall short.\nThis is called: *with my nature, I accord to theirs*.\n\n**Chapter Thirty: Aiding the Ruler with the Dao**\nTo aid a ruler with the Dao,\none does not use force to subdue the world,\nand one’s actions are naturally self-reverting.\n\nWhere the army encamps,\nthorns and brambles grow.\nAfter great battles,\nthere must be years of hardship.\nThe virtuous act decisively,\nyet do not dare to force victory.\n\nDecisive yet not boastful,\ndecisive yet not arrogant,\ndecisive yet not proud,\ndecisive only when unavoidable,\ndecisive yet not forcing—\nthis is the Dao.\nViolating the Dao brings early ruin.\n\nHe who kills another’s father,\nothers will kill his father.\nHe who kills another’s elder brother,\nothers will kill his elder brother.\nThis is called *self-reverting*.\n\nThe harm of losing in war\nis not easily measured by one or two.\nEven if one wins by chance,\nthe killing energy’s repercussions\ncannot be made to grow by earth,\ncannot be made to harmonize by heaven.\nThus thorns and brambles grow where battles are waged,\nand famine arises after military campaigns.\nHence, the harm of losing can be known.\n\nThus the virtuous warrior,\nacting only when unavoidable,\nachieves decisive victory in one battle,\nyet does not use it to force further triumphs.\nDecisive victory is fleeting.\nWithin, he holds the heart of *unavoidable necessity*,\nwithout, he wages a single decisive battle—\nthus he never boasts,\nnever grows proud,\nnever arrogates,\nnever forces.\nAll this stems from acting only when unavoidable.\n\nIf one acts when it is avoidable yet does not cease,\nthe army grows old and its energy decays—\nlike a man in his prime who must grow old,\nthis is violating the Dao.\nViolating the Dao brings early death.\nEven if a man does not violate the Dao,\nhe still dies before his time;\nhow much more so when the army truly grows old?\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One: On Fine Arms**\nFine arms are an inauspicious instrument;\nthings naturally abhor them,\nso those who follow the Dao do not wield them.\n\nThe gentleman values the left in dwelling,\nvalues the right in wielding arms.\nArms are an inauspicious instrument,\nnot the instrument of the gentleman,\nyet they are used only when unavoidable.\nCalmness and simplicity are supreme,\nvictory without delight—\nyet those who delight in victory\nare those who delight in killing.\n\nHe who delights in killing\ncannot achieve his desires in the world.\nAuspicious matters favor the left,\ninauspicious matters favor the right.\nThe Left General is stationed on the left,\nthe Right General on the right—\nthis is said with funeral rites in mind.\n\nThe multitude of those killed\nshould be mourned with sorrowful tears,\nvictory in battle should be treated with funeral rites.\nArms cannot be fine and yet fine,\njust as a man cannot be killed and yet killed.\nThus, one who does not delight in killing\ncan then speak of arms.\n\nSunzi and Wuqi’s theories on arms\nexamine empty and full,\ndiscern irregular and regular—\ntheir words are meticulous.\nYet the roots of empty and full,\nirregular and regular,\nSunzi and Wuqi may not have known.\n\nThe *Old Master* says: *Calmness and simplicity are supreme,\nvictory without delight.*\nTo speak of arms with calmness and simplicity,\ntruly seems unlike,\nyet without calmness and simplicity there is no stillness—\nstillness is the root of victory.\nWithout stillness, there is agitation—\nagitation is the foundation of defeat.\n\nWhen Liang Xiang asked Mencius:\n*“How will the world ever be settled?”*\nMencius replied:\n*“It is settled by one.”*\nLiang Xiang asked:\n*“Who can settle it by one?”*\nMencius replied:\n*“He who does not delight in killing can settle it by one.”*\nPity that he lacked the wisdom to know this.\n\nIf one were truly not to delight in killing,\nhe could settle the world—\nthere would be nothing difficult.\nFrom ancient times to now,\nthose who do not delight in killing must rise,\nthose who delight in killing must fall.\nThose who delight in killing and yet temporarily succeed\nhave already perished;\nthere has never been one who delights in killing\nand yet endures for many years.\n\nThus the gentleman,\nwhen victorious in war,\ntreats it with funeral rites.\nAn inauspicious instrument,\nthose who follow the Dao do not wield it.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two: The Dao is Always Nameless**\nThe Dao is always nameless.\nThough crude, it is small,\nyet the world dares not submit to it.\nIf lords and kings could preserve it,\nall things would voluntarily come as guests.\n\nHeaven and earth unite,\nand sweet dew descends.\nNo one commands it,\nyet it is evenly distributed.\nWhen governance first began,\nnames were established.\nOnce names were established,\npeople knew them.\nThey knew them,\nyet did not begin with them.\n\nThe Dao in the world\nis like

perfectly united, sweet dew descends.\nNo one commands it,\nyet all is evenly distributed.\nHeaven and earth never cease to harmonize,\nand thus the distribution is natural.\nFrom this, we see:\nThe Dao though small, must not be slighted;\nlords and kings though great, must not be revered;\nheaven and earth though divided, are not estranged.\nThough the Dao disperses into all things,\neach thing has its name,\nyet heaven never abandons them.\nIt is because heaven never abandons them\nthat all things stand between heaven and earth\nwithout perishing—\nfor heaven is their source.\nThus, things do not diminish the Dao by dispersing,\nnor does the Dao scatter by giving rise to things.\nCompare it to rivers and valleys becoming clouds and rain,\nor the ocean giving rise to moisture.\nThe qi of rivers and valleys\nnever ceases to flow into the ocean,\nnor does the ocean’s qi\ncease to return to the rivers and valleys.\nIf viewed through the Dao,\nthey are in constant cycle—\nnever a day without return.\nBut if grasped through instruments,\nthen land and water are divided,\nand their paths differ.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three: Knowing People is Wisdom**\nKnowing others is wisdom,\nknowing oneself is clarity.\nOvercoming others is strength,\novercoming oneself is power.\nKnowing contentment is wealth,\nunyielding action is resolve.\nNot losing one’s place is longevity,\ndying without perishing is life.\n\nWisdom lies in outward perception,\nclarity in inward reflection.\nStrength lies in outward victory,\npower in inward mastery.\nWisdom and strength are delusion,\nclarity and power are true.\nAll who enter the Dao’s gate\nmust pass through this.\n\nYet people cannot enter the Dao\nbecause they fail to see their own clarity,\nand are overcome by things.\nIf one’s inner clarity is true,\nthen one does not chase the external.\nNot chasing the external,\none gradually overcomes things.\nWith days deepened,\none naturally enters the Dao.\n\nAll who lack contentment\nare unaware of their own sufficiency.\nAll things are already within me—\nturning inward, I know:\nTaking what is within myself is enough—\nis this not wealth?\nContentment born,\nI gradually depart from all desires.\nThough strength is not yet complete,\nI cannot fully manifest what I see,\nso I must act with resolve.\nSeeing the pure root,\nI gradually return to the Dao.\nWithin emptiness, I verify the true attainment—\nunbound by past or future,\nvast and ever-present,\nthis is called not losing one’s place,\nequally viewing life and death,\nas morning and evening.\nLiving without attachment,\ndying without loss—\nthis is called life.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Four: The Great Dao Flows**\nThe great Dao flows—\nit can be turned to left or right.\nAll things depend on it for birth\nyet it does not claim credit.\nWhen its work is done,\nit does not name itself.\nIt loves and nourishes all things\nyet does not rule as king.\nEver without desire,\nit is called small.\nAll things return to it,\nyet it does not lord over them—\nthis is called great.\nThus the sage never claims to be great,\nand so can achieve true greatness.\n\nThe great Dao flows—\nfilling all eight extremes,\nyet when it acts,\nit seems to be at hand.\nAll things are not born without the Dao,\nyet the Dao never claims to have given them birth.\nAll things are not completed without the Dao,\nyet the Dao never names its own achievements.\nAll things are not nourished without the Dao,\nyet the Dao never considers itself their master.\n\nWhen it is small,\nits traces are not seen.\nWhen it is great,\nit does not lord over all things.\nYet all things return to it.\nSo too does the sage.\nNever claiming greatness,\nyet nothing surpasses them.\nIt is because they do not take greatness\nthat they achieve true greatness.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Five: Grasping the Great Image**\nGrasping the great image,\nthe world follows.\nFollowing without harm,\none is at peace, tranquil, and serene.\nPleasure and bait,\nand the Dao’s words—\nwhen spoken, they are bland as tastelessness;\nwhen seen, they are not visible;\nwhen heard, they are not audible;\nwhen used, they are inexhaustible.\n\nThe Dao descends and takes form—\nform arises, and things follow it.\nThe foolish follow without return,\nthe wise follow without harm.\nThose who follow without return\nlose the Dao and follow things.\nThose who follow without harm\ngo with the Dao.\n\nIf one goes with the Dao,\none never departs from it,\nand is at ease everywhere,\ntranquil everywhere,\nserene everywhere.\nUniting with the Dao,\none’s heart does not know the Dao,\nthe Dao does not know one’s heart.\nIf one knows the Dao and acts accordingly,\nthen there will be no ease,\nno tranquility,\nno serenity.\n\nThe sage’s relation to form and instruments\nis like a traveler’s stay in an inn—\ntemporarily dwelling, then departing,\nnever holding attachment.\nIf one is lured by pleasure and desire,\nthe traveler will stay at the inn,\nlingering without leaving—\nnone will escape harm.\nThus the sage, though among forms and instruments,\ngrasps the great image and

supreme righteousness acts and yet has much to do.\n\nThe supreme propriety acts and none respond,\nSo they roll up their sleeves and force it upon them.\nThus, when the Way is lost, virtue arises;\nWhen virtue is lost, benevolence arises;\nWhen benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;\nWhen righteousness is lost, propriety arises.\n\nFor propriety is the thinning of loyalty and trust,\nAnd the beginning of chaos.\nPrescience is the flourishing of the Way,\nAnd the origin of folly.\n\nThus, the noble one abides in substance, not in thinness;\nAbides in reality, not in flourishing.\nHence, they discard the latter and take the former.\n\nThe supreme virtue does not virtue,\nYet in benevolence, it is benevolent;\nIn righteousness, it is righteous.\nIt follows its course without clinging.\n\nThe lesser virtue does not lose virtue,\nYet benevolence cannot be made into righteousness,\nAnd righteousness cannot be made into propriety.\nOnce done, it cannot be altered.\n\nThus, the supreme virtue does not lose the Way.\nThe Way is ever without action,\nYet the mind of non-action is within it.\nThe lesser virtue does not lose virtue,\nYet virtue is with action,\nAnd the traces of action appear.\n\nThe supreme virtue is non-action—this is benevolence.\nBenevolence is near the Way,\nThus it is said: \"Man is benevolence.\"\nWhen combined, it is the Way.\nBenevolence is near the Way,\nThus it is also without action,\nAnd without anything to do.\n\nDescending to righteousness,\nRighteousness is what is fitting.\nTo act fittingly toward things,\nThere is something to do.\nYet acting does not lose what is fitting—\nIt is still not lost.\n\nDescending further to propriety,\nPropriety is order.\nTo order things with propriety,\nIf none respond yet I insist on ordering them,\nThen there will be those who roll up their sleeves and force it.\nThis cannot be called the Way,\nBut it can be called virtue.\nVirtue in man is benevolence;\nBenevolence not losing what is fitting is righteousness;\nRighteousness rectifying things is propriety.\nThus, when the Way is lost, virtue arises;\nWhen virtue is lost, benevolence arises;\nWhen benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;\nWhen righteousness is lost, propriety arises—\nThis is the natural order.\n\nFrom the Way descending five times,\nUntil it reaches propriety,\nAfter five descents, it is no longer worth observing.\n\nFor propriety arises from chaos,\nAnd because there are elders and juniors,\nWithout propriety, there is chaos,\nThus propriety is established to remedy it.\nYet when it comes to rolling up one’s sleeves and forcing it,\nThen propriety is also lost.\nThus, propriety is the beginning of chaos.\n\nMuch knowledge is insufficient for the Way,\nFor its excess confuses the true origin.\nKnowledge not from the true is empty and unreal.\nThus, much knowledge is the beginning of folly,\nAnd propriety is the thinning of loyalty and trust,\nWhile prescience is the flourishing of the Way.\n\nThe sage abides in substance, not in thinness,\nValues reality, not flourishing,\nThus they never lose the Way’s foundation.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine: The Ancient Who Obtained the One**\n\nThe ancient who obtained the One:\nThe heavens obtained the One and became clear,\nThe earth obtained the One and

perish;\nIf the sovereigns and kings did not obtain the One, they would fear to fall.\n\nThus, the noble is rooted in the lowly,\nThe high is founded on the lowly,\nHence the sovereigns and kings call themselves \"lonely,\" \"widowed,\" \"not-grain\"—\nIs this not rooting in the lowly?\nIs it not?\n\nThus, when the carts are many, the axle is unseen,\nNot dazzling like jade, nor cold like stone.\nConfucius said: \"My Way is one and penetrates all.\"\nWhat is this \"one\"?\nThe clarity of the heavens,\nThe tranquility of the earth,\nThe numinosity of the spirit,\nThe fullness of the valleys,\nThe life of all things,\nThe rectification of the sovereigns and kings.\nPushing to its utmost, they are all the same.\n\nKnowing how the heavens are clear,\nOne knows how the earth is tranquil.\nKnowing how the spirit is numinous,\nOne knows how the valleys are full.\nKnowing how things come to life,\nOne knows how the sovereigns and kings rectify.\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* says:\n\"The world takes different paths yet arrives at the same destination;\nA hundred thoughts converge in one harmony.\"\nThe world—what does it think, what does it ponder?\nIt speaks of never not being one.\n\nIf one does not know the One,\nThen they must differ from themselves,\nAnd differing, they sever from things.\nIf the sovereigns and kings sever from things,\nThings will also sever from them.\n\nThus, the noble is rooted in the lowly,\nThe high is founded on the lowly,\nThe sovereigns and kings call themselves \"lonely,\" \"widowed,\" \"not-grain\"—\nIs this not knowing that the noble is rooted in the lowly?\n\nThe spokes and hubs converge to form the cart,\nYet the cart cannot be named.\nRen, yi, li, zhi combine to form the Way,\nYet the Way cannot be named.\nRewards, punishments, and rectifications combine to form governance,\nYet governance cannot be named.\n\nIf there is something to grasp and employ,\nIts traces appear externally—\nThe noble like jade, the

love leads to great expenditure,\nExcessive hoarding leads to great loss.\nKnowing contentment brings no disgrace,\nKnowing restraint brings no peril—\nThus one may endure long.\n\nName is not closer than the body,\nWealth is not more abundant than the body,\nGain does not compensate for loss.\nYet the world’s people always blame the name,\nDrown in wealth,\nAnd pursue gain—\nBecause they see nothing deeper.\nI love things, and the more I love, the more I expend.\nThings are stored within me, and the more there are, the more I labor.\nLittle love brings disgrace,\nGreat love brings danger—\nAnd there are regrets one cannot overcome.\n\nBut the noble person is not so.\nKnowing that all things are already complete within me,\nI reflect inwardly and find contentment—\nThus I seek nothing externally.\nEven if they wish to disgrace me,\nThey cannot.\nKnowing where my stopping lies,\nI halt at the Dao’s fullness—\nThus I act only in accord with the Dao.\nEven if they wish to make me act,\nThey cannot.\nThis is how I remain constant,\nAnd constant, I endure.\n\n**Chapter 45: The Great Completeness as if Deficient**\n\nThe great completeness appears as if deficient—\nIts use is unending.\nThe great fullness seems like emptiness—\nIts use is inexhaustible.\nThe most upright seems bent,\nThe most skillful seems clumsy,\nThe most eloquent seems tongue-tied.\nAgitation overcomes cold,\nQuietude overcomes heat.\nPurity and stillness are the rectitude of all under heaven.\n\nCompleteness and deficiency,\nFullness and emptiness,\nUprightness and bending,\nSkill and clumsiness,\nEloquence and silence—\nAll are mere semblances of things.\n\nOnly the Dao is nameless.\nTo seek it by form,\nOne can never attain it.\nThus, though completeness seems like deficiency,\nThough fullness seems like emptiness,\nThough uprightness seems like bending,\nThough skill seems like clumsiness,\nThough eloquence seems like silence—\nIts completeness is not in form,\nIts fullness is not in vessels,\nIts uprightness is not in strength,\nIts skill is not in the mind,\nIts eloquence is not in speech.\nTherefore, the world seeks it by semblance and form,\nYet can never attain it.\n\nThe world’s talk of Dao and skill\nHas never been without bias—\nLike agitation overcoming cold,\nYet failing to overcome heat,\nOr quietude overcoming heat,\nYet failing to overcome cold.\nEach has its proper limit.\nOnly purity, stillness, and *wuwei*\nNeed not seek to overcome things,\nYet none under heaven can overcome it.\nThus it is said: purity and stillness are the rectitude of all under heaven.\n\n**Chapter 46: Not Stepping Beyond the Door**\n\nNot stepping beyond the door,\nYet knowing all under heaven.\nNot peering through the window,\nYet seeing the Dao of Heaven.\nThe farther one goes,\nThe less one knows.\nThus the sage acts without moving,\nNames without seeing,\nAchieves without doing.\n\nThose who venture forth to seek Heaven and Earth\nSeek only their forms.\nHeaven and Earth cannot be fully grasped by form,\nYet can be fully understood by principle—\nThus the farther one goes,\nThe less one knows.\nIf one knows that their principle lies within,\nThen even closing the door suffices.\n\nThe sage knows the Dao is not in form,\nThus need not move;\nName is not in appearance,\nThus need not see;\nAchievement is not in action,\nThus need not do.\n\n**Chapter 47: When the World Follows the Dao**\n\nWhen the world follows the Dao,\nWarhorses are turned back to dung.\nWhen the world does not follow the Dao,\nWarhorses breed in the suburbs.\n\nNo crime is greater than desiring what should not be desired,\nNo calamity greater than failing to know contentment,\nNo fault greater than seeking what one has already obtained.\n\nThus, knowing contentment as contentment,\nOne is always content.\nWhen the world follows the Dao,\nIt can make soldiers serve the people.\nWhen the world does not follow the Dao,\nIt can make the people serve as soldiers.\n\nWhen one knows the Dao,\nIt can make color appear as void.\nWhen one does not know the Dao,\nIt can make void appear as color.\n\nDesiring what should not be desired—\nThis is love.\nFailing to know contentment—\nThis is taking.\nSeeking what one has already obtained—\nThis is having.\n\nFrom love arises taking,\nFrom taking arises having,\nAnd from having, endless faults proliferate.\nIf one knows that taking need not come from without,\nThis is called knowing contentment.\nKnowing contentment,\nOne knows no lack.\n\n**Chapter 48: Learning and the Dao**\n\nLearning increases daily,\nThe Dao decreases daily.\nDecrease it again and again,\nUntil one reaches *wuwei*—\nThen there is nothing one cannot do.\nTo take the world by doing nothing,\nYet when one does something,\nIt is insufficient to take the world.\n\nLearning is for seeking knowledge,\nThus it increases daily.\nThe Dao is for discarding illusion,\nThus it decreases daily.\nIf knowledge is not fully realized,\nThen decrease is not complete—\nThus, learning daily\nIs the means for daily decrease.\n\nIf one decreases again and again,\nIllusion is discarded and truth is fully realized,\nThen one attains *wuwei*.\nWhen *wuwei* is fully reached,\nEven if one takes the world,\nOne still does not see its use.\nIf one takes the world by doing something,\nOne cannot even obtain a single thing—\nHow much less can one take the world now?\n\nThe sage has no fixed heart.\n\n**Chapter 49: The Sage’s Heart**\n\nThe sage’s heart is without fixity—\nHe takes the hearts of the people as his own.\nThe good, I treat as good,\nThe not-good, I also treat as good—\nThis is virtue’s goodness.\nThe trustworthy, I trust,\nThe untrustworthy, I also trust—\nThis is virtue’s trust.\n\nThe sage moves among the people,\nHis presence makes their hearts pure as water—\nThe people all strain their ears and eyes,\nYet the sage treats them as children.\n\nGreat indeed is the harm of the heart!\nZhuangzi says: No thief is greater than virtue’s heart,\nAnd the heart’s eyes.\n\nThe heart, as a thing,\nPenetrates Heaven, and Heaven is penetrated;\nPenetrates Earth, and Earth is penetrated—\nNo distance it cannot reach.\nYet the world’s people take only distinctions for the heart.\nWhen the heart of distinctions arises,\nThey falsely see what is not,\nAnd lose their wholeness.\nThis is why Zhuangzi calls it a thief.\n\nThe sage’s heart\nIs always with the Dao,\nThe Dao is everywhere—\nThus his heart is everywhere.\nHence, he has no fixed heart.\nWhen it emerges to respond to the world,\nHe knows that all things follow illusion—\nThus the heart of taking and discarding never arises.\n\nThe good, I follow and treat as good,\nThe not-good, I also follow and treat as good—\nToward all under heaven, there is none I do not treat as good.\nThis is called virtue’s goodness.",

to set its claws,\nThe weapons find no place to lodge their blades.\nThough there is life, it does not **cling**—\nOnce they know it does not cling,\nThen they know what is meant by **not-death**.\n\n道生之章第五十－\n**道**生之，**德**畜之，\n物形之，**势**成之。\n是以万物莫不尊**道**而贵**德**。\n**道**之尊，**德**之贵，\n夫莫之命而常自然。\n故**道**生之，**德**畜之，\n长之育之，成之熟之，\n养之覆之，\n生而不有，为而不恃，\n长而不宰，\n是谓**玄德**。\n\n**Chapter 50: The Dao Gives Birth**\nThe **Dao** gives birth to it,\n**Virtue** nurtures it,\nThings take shape from it,\nAnd **momentum** brings it to completion.\nThus, all things do not fail to **revere the Dao** and **honor virtue**.\nThe **Dao’s reverence**, the **virtue’s honor**—\nNone command them, yet they always **operate naturally**.\nThus, the **Dao** gives birth to it,\n**Virtue** nurtures it,\n**Extends and cultivates** it,\n**Matures and perfects** it,\n**Nourishes and shelters** it—\nGiving birth yet not possessing,\nCreating yet not relying,\nExtending yet not controlling—\nThis is called **mysterious virtue**.\n\n物非**道**不生，\n非**德**不畜，\n自其有形，\n以至於**势**长，\n莫不以**道德**为主。\n**道**之尊，**德**之贵，\n至於此极矣。\n然不自尊其尊，\n不自贵其贵。\n其施於物非有心於物也，\n莫之命而常自然。\n自然而生，\n自然而畜，\n凡所以长育成熟，\n以至于养之覆之，\n莫非自然者，\n由其自然。\n故未尝望物之报，\n生不辞劳，\n施不求报，\n是谓**玄德**。\n\nThings cannot be born without the **Dao**,\nCannot be nurtured without **virtue**,\nFrom the moment they take form,\nUntil they grow in **momentum**,\nThey all rely on **Dao and virtue** as their foundation.\nThe **Dao’s reverence**, the **virtue’s honor**—\nThis reaches their utmost.\nYet they do not **self-revere their reverence**,\nNor **self-honor their honor**.\nTheir bestowal upon things is not done with **intent**—\nNone command them, yet they always **operate naturally**.\nThey **naturally give birth**,\nThey **naturally nurture**,\nAll that **extends, cultivates, matures, and perfects**,\nEven to **nourishing and sheltering**—\nNone of these are done otherwise,\nFor they follow their **nature**.\nThus, they never **seek the things’ recompense**,\nThey **do not shun labor in birth**,\nThey **bestow without demanding return**—\nThis is called **mysterious virtue**.\n\n天下有始章第五十二\n**天下有始**，以为天下母。\n既知其母，复知其子。\n既知其子，复守其母，\n没身不殆。\n**塞**其兑，**闭**其门，\n终身不勤。\n**开**其兑，**济**其事，\n终身不救。\n见小曰明，守柔曰强。\n用其光，复归其明，\n无遗身殃，\n是谓**袭常**。\n\n**Chapter 52: Heaven and Earth Have a Beginning**\n**Heaven and earth have a beginning**,\nAnd this is the **origin of all things**.\nOnce you know its **origin**,\nYou also know its **manifestation**.\nOnce you know its **manifestation**,\nYou also **hold fast to its origin**,\nAnd thus your life will not be **exhausted**.\n**Close its apertures** and **shut its gates**,\nAnd your strength will never **wan**.\n**Open its apertures** and **pursue its ends**,\nAnd your life will never **be preserved**.\nTo **perceive the minute** is called **clarity**,\nTo **hold fast to the soft** is called **strength**.\nTo **employ its radiance** and **return to its clarity**,\nIs to **leave no calamity behind**—\nThis is called **following the constant**.\n\n**Dao** as **origin**, things as **manifestation**.\nThe ancients who attained the **Dao**\nCould make **origin and manifestation** never part,\nAnd thus **Dao and things** became one.\nThings **emerge from Dao**,\nThings are not **other than Dao**,\nManifestation **comes from origin**,\nManifestation is not **other than origin**.\nThings are not **other than Dao**,\nYet the world **discards things** to seek **Dao**,\nManifestation is not **other than origin**,\nYet the world **discards manifestation** to seek **origin**—\nThey are not **other**, yet they **self-separate**,\nThus they never **attain unity**.\n\nIf you make men know that **things are the Dao**,\nThat **manifestation is origin**,\nAnd they **hold fast to this knowledge**,\nThen they will **find their roots on every side**,\nAnd there will be nothing difficult.\n\nThose who do not **follow the Dao** but instead **use things** to **lose the Dao**,\nAre like men who **open their apertures**.\n**Apertures** are **breaches**—\nTo **pierce their breaches** and **pursue their desires**,\nTheir **mind becomes agitated** and their **vital essence weakens**,\nThen **things perish** as they **grasp them**—\nYou must **close their apertures**,\n**Shut their gates**,\nSo that their **spirit does not exit**,\nAnd they **revolve back** to **nature’s origin**,\nThus **origin and manifestation** will not **part**,\nAnd **Dao and things** will become one.\n\nThe ancients who reached **perfection**,\n**Preserved their lives** and thus **lived**—\nThey employed this **Dao**.\n\nMan’s **breath** lies in **not exhausting the minute**,\nNor **nourishing the trifling**.\nIf you **exhaust the minute** or **nourish the trifling**,\nThough they be small, they must **be perceived as clarity**,\nThough they be trifling, they must **be held as strength**.\nThus it is said:\nTo **perceive the minute** is called **clarity**,\nTo **know the soft** is called **strength**.\n**Clarity** is the **root**,\n**Radiance** is what **emerges from clarity**.\n**Original clarity** is the **root**,\nIts **branches** divide into **vision**, **hearing**, **awareness**, and **contact**—\nAll are its **radiance**.\nThe **Dao** flows from **root to branch**,\nLearning **seeks the branch** to find the **root**—\nThus it is said:\nTo **employ its radiance** and **return to its clarity**,\nIs called **following the constant**.\n**Constant** is the **root**,\n**Clarity and radiance** naturally **emanate from clarity**—\nNow to **return radiance to clarity**,\nIs called **following the

cultivation is called the accumulation of profound virtue.\nProfound virtue accumulated means nothing is unconquerable.\nIf nothing is unconquerable, its limits are unknown.\nWhen its limits are unknown, one can possess a realm.\nThe mother of possessing a realm is what makes it endure.\nThis is the Dao of deep roots and firm foundation,\nOf enduring life and long vision.\nIn governing externally, in serving Heaven internally—\nNone surpasses frugality.\n\nFrugality means nothing is left unharmonized.\nTo be cautious within, to be tranquil without,\nTo let the inner mind not stray, the outer mind not rise—\nThis is called harmonization, and thus one can cultivate early.\n\nTo cultivate within the heart, to cultivate without the form,\nTo remain still and unmoving—\nThen virtue begins to accumulate.\nAccumulating in what is not accumulated,\nNothing can be unconquered.\nIf nothing is unconquered, nothing remains untamed.\nEven with a realm, it is still attainable.\n\nPeople know one can possess a realm,\nBut they do not know that those who can possess a realm\nAre those who have their roots.\nWhen roots are deeply planted,\nEven dross and husks are refined into Yao and Shun—\nWhat of those beneath them?\n\nThis is called deep roots and firm foundation,\nThe Dao of governing people and serving Heaven.\"\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 60: Governing a Great Realm**\n\n*\"To

cunning, and bizarre would transform into the Dao.\nHow could the Dao harm anyone?\n\nThe intent is to not harm people,\nSo even in the unseen—spirits and gods—\nThey cannot harm with their numinosity.\nIn governance and in the unseen,\nNeither harms the other—\nThus, the hearts of people and spirits return in harmony.\nIs this not the work of supreme virtue?\"\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 61: Great Realms as the World’s Dependent**\n\n*\"Great realms are the world’s tributary.\nThe world’s tributary is like the female.\nThe female always overcomes the male by stillness,\nBy yielding as

take,\nSometimes yielding while taking—\nA great realm seeks only to nurture others,\nA small realm seeks only to serve others.\n\nBoth gain what they desire,\nSo the great should properly yield.\nIf a great realm yields to obtain things,\nThings will surely return to it.\nThe female, yielding in stillness, overcomes the male.\nThus, the female always overcomes the male.\nIf a great realm yields to a small realm, it will surely obtain the small realm.\nIf a small realm yields to a great realm, it will surely obtain the great realm.\nThus, the great realm sometimes yields to take the small,\nThe small realm sometimes yields to take the great.\nTaking means each secures its own heart.\n\nTherefore, a great realm seeks only to nurture small realms,\nA small realm seeks only to serve great realms—\nOnly thus do both attain what they desire.\n\nMencius said:\n‘To serve the great with the small is to fear Heaven.\nTo serve the small with the great is to delight in Heaven.\nThose who delight in Heaven preserve the world,\nThose who fear Heaven preserve their realm.\nThus, great realms should especially yield.’\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 62: The Dao as the Essence of All

presenting this Dao.\n\nWhy did the ancients value this Dao?\nNot merely to gain rewards,\nNor to escape punishments.\nThus, it is prized by the world.\n\nEssence means to hide.\nThe Dao is what all things treasure,\nLike a hidden storehouse for things.\nThe virtuous take the Dao as their treasure,\nThus, they rejoice in their gains.\nThe unvirtuous have no refuge but the Dao,\nThus, they rejoice in escaping blame.\nThis is rooted in the natural heart of humanity,\nWithout artificial prompting.\n\nThus, if speech aligns with the Dao,\nIts beauty can be sold.\nIf conduct aligns with the Dao,\nIts nobility can be bestowed upon others.\nIf not rooted in the natural heart,\nSpeech will not be followed,\nConduct will not be emulated.\n\nSince all are rooted in the Dao,\nIf by misfortune

not exhausted.\nWhat the world calls ‘great or small, many or few’—\nThis is but a matter of form.\n\nThe Sage moves beyond form and instrument,\nSo great and small, many and few—\nAre equal and made one.\n\nIf great and small, many and few,\nAre already equal and unified,\nHow much more so the distinctions of favor and resentment,\nOf repayment and bestowal?\n\nWhat I do and what I bestow—\nIs virtue alone.\nHow could I know of resentment,\nHow could I know of repayment?\n\nSince there is no distinction between favor and resentment,\nNo difference between great and small, many and few,\nThen in regard to the world’s affairs,\nHow could there be any intent to act?\n\nDifficult tasks must be approached in ease,\nGreat tasks must begin in smallness.\nFrom ease proceed, and even difficulty becomes easy.\nFrom smallness act, and even greatness becomes small.\n\nThus the Sage never acts in grandness,\nAnd so grandness must return to him—\nBecause he holds no intent.\n\nIt is only because the Sage holds no intent in action,\nThat he never seeks results before the deed is done.\nHow unlike the petty men of the world,\nWho promise before they act,\nAnd when the task arrives, seek ease!\n\nTo promise before acting brings few fulfilled words,\nTo seek ease in difficulty brings many failures.\nThe Sage, before the task arrives,\nEver treats it as though it were

feet.\n\nThe doer brings ruin,\nThe grasper loses hold.\nThus the Sage does not act—so he knows no ruin.\nHe does not grasp—so he knows no loss.\n\nThe people’s undertakings\nOften fail when nearly complete.\nTo be cautious at the end and know the beginning—\nThen there will be no ruined work.\n\nThus the Sage desires without desiring,\nDoes not prize hard-to-obtain goods.\nHe learns without learning,\nReturns to the errors of the common folk.\nTo aid the natural unfolding of all things,\nAnd not dare to act.\n\nThe Sage ever rests in what is at rest,\nSo his rest knows no disturbance,\nAnd his holding knows no fixation—\nHence, it is called ‘easy to hold.’\n\nBy not holding, he holds his ease.\nIf even the slightest intention arises,\nHe plans against it before it shows,\nBreaks it before it hardens,\nScatters it before it spreads—\nAnd so none can disrupt his ease.\n\nFrom holding ease before it exists,\nFrom ordering the mind before it is disordered.\nLike a tree as thick as a man’s embrace\nGrowing from a tiny sprout,\nA nine-tiered tower rising from a pile of earth,\nA thousand-li journey beginning beneath one’s feet—\nIn the midst of *non-doing*, it

intent,\nThen one brings ruin.\nIf one grasps with intent,\nThen one loses hold.\n\nBecause he does not act, he knows no ruin.\nBecause he does not grasp, he knows no loss.\nThe world’s difficulty in attaining the Dao\nAnd its ease in destroying it—\nArises from its intent to act and to grasp.\n\nWhen its beginning, it seems to have no room for effort,\nAnd when its end, it still cannot escape neglect.\nAll are the faults of acting and grasping.\n\nIf at its beginning one did not act,\nIf at its beginning one did not grasp,\nThen one could not even find its effort—\nHow much less its neglect?\n\nThis is why the world’s undertakings\nOften fail when nearly complete.\n\nThe Sage alone\nTakes ‘not desiring’ as desiring,\nDoes not prize hard-to-obtain goods.\nWhat is called ‘hard to obtain’—\nIs not necessarily gold and jade.\nThings outside the self,\nAll are hard to obtain.\n\nThe common folk’s eyes are bewildered by color,\nTheir ears by sound.\nI take ‘not learning’ as learning,\nRetreat the gaze and invert the hearing,\nReturn to the errors of the common folk,\nTo aid the Dao’s natural unfolding—\nAnd dare not act.\n\nOh, how could there be any disease of acting and grasping?\nThe ancients’ skill in cultivating the Dao—\n\n**Chapter 65: The Ancients’ Skill in Cultivating the Dao**\"\n\nThe ancients who excelled in cultivating the Dao\nDid not enlighten the people,\nBut rather sought to befuddle them.\n\nThe people are hard to govern\nBecause their cleverness is excessive.\nTo govern with cleverness—\nIs the ruin of the state.\nNot to govern with cleverness—\nIs the blessing of the state.\n\nTo know these two is called the *lǐ* (pattern).\nTo be able to know the *lǐ*—\nThis is called *xuán dé* (mysterious virtue).\n\nThe mysterious virtue is profound and distant,\nOpposed to things.\nOnly then does one reach great harmony.\n\nWhat is called ‘seeing and hearing, awareness and knowledge’—\nDoes not lie in sounds and colors.\n\nYet the world’s eyes see not color,\nIts ears hear not sound,\nAnd is hindered by sounds and colors,\nUnknowing that seeing and hearing,\nAwareness and knowledge,\nExtend beyond sounds and colors.\n\nNow if I suddenly told people:\n‘Your seeing and hearing, your awareness and knowledge—\nAll are not true!’\nThen who would not be astonished and scornful?\n\nThus the Dao is not to enlighten the people,\nBut rather to befuddle and love them—\nThis is acceptable.\n\nThe people’s befuddlement\nIs hindered by sounds and colors,\nAnd they do not know how to free themselves.\nI will show them *non-doing*,\nI will show them *dànpō* (tranquil simplicity),\nYet they still do not awaken—\nHow much less could I enlighten them with cleverness?\n\nThe people’s affliction lies in their excess of cleverness.\nIf cleverness is not used rightly,\nThen their cleverness becomes perverse.\nNow I cannot awaken their perversity,\nAnd yet I would enlighten them with cleverness—\nThis is to open their deceit anew.\n\nThus to govern with cleverness is ruin to the state.\nIf one follows what is without action,\nAnd does not open the people’s scheming hearts,\nThen scheming does not arise,\nAnd purity and wholeness are complete—\nThis is called the blessing of the state.\nIs this not acceptable?\n\nThe actions of the ruler above\nAre emulated by the people below.\nThere has never been a case where I am tranquil and they are agitated,\nOr where I am simple and the people are filled with desires.\n\nTo know the *lǐ* and to know the *lǐ*—\nThis is called *xuán dé* (mysterious virtue).\"",

therefore called the Great Order.\n\n**Why the Sea and Rivers Are Sovereign Over All Valleys (Chapter 66)**\nThe sea and rivers can be sovereign over all valleys\nBecause they excel in yielding to them,\nThus they can be sovereign over all valleys.\nTherefore, the sage who wishes to lead the people\nDoes so by speaking from below.\nWho would be first among the people\nDoes so by placing himself behind them.\nThus, though he stands above them, the people do not feel burdened,\nThough he leads them, they are not harmed.\nHence, the world gladly follows and never tires.\nBecause he does not contend,\nNo one in the world can contend with him.\n\nWhen the sage, of necessity, governs the world,\nHe views those who first emerge from the myriad things\nAnd those who stand above the people\nAs matters of equal concern.\nThus, though he holds the world,\nHe leads the people by speaking from below,\nAnd governs them by placing himself behind.\nIt is not the one who forgets the world\nWho can do this.\nTherefore, though he stands above the people, they do not feel burdened,\nAnd though he leads them, they do not know he is their ruler.\nThough he stands before the people, they are not harmed,\nAnd though he leads them, they do not know he is their leader.\nOnly when both above and below forget each other,\nIs it that the world gladly follows and never tires.\nFor the things I take are not what the people contend for.\nThe Way of *wuwei* (non-action),\nThe world does not even see its traces—\nHow much less would it dare contend with me?\n\n**The World’s Praise of My Dao (Chapter 67)**\nThe world all says my Dao is vast,\nYet seems unlike the common.\nOnly because it is vast,\nDoes it seem unlike the common.\nIf it seemed like the common,\nLong ago it would have been trifling.\n\nI have three treasures, which I hold and preserve:\nThe first is *cí* (benevolence/mercy),\nThe second is *jiǎn* (frugality),\nThe third is *bù gǎn wéi tiānxià xiān* (not daring to act before the world).\n\nBenevolence makes one courageous,\nFrugality makes one abundant,\nNot daring to act before the world\nMakes one a vessel of lasting worth.\nNow if I abandon my benevolence and yet seek courage,\nAbandon my frugality and yet seek abundance,\nAbandon my humility and yet act before the world,\nI shall perish.\n\nBenevolence—\nWhen wielding arms, it wins;\nWhen defending, it holds firm.\nHeaven, when about to save, uses benevolence to shield.\nThe common seek only outward form.\nIf one seeks the great through outward form,\nEven reaching to the heavens and earth,\nIt is still where his pursuit ends.\nThe world all calls it great,\nYet it seems unlike the common.\nOnly because it is great,\nDo all things prove insufficient to match its likeness.\nIf it had such likeness,\nThen I too would be but one thing,\nAnd my greatness would have long since faded.\n\nYet the means by which I achieve greatness\nStill rely on these three treasures to hold and preserve:\nThe first is *cí* (benevolence/mercy),\nThe second is *jiǎn* (frugality),\nThe third is *bù gǎn wéi tiānxià xiān* (not daring to act before the world).\nThese three are not the means to greatness,\nYet those who wield greatness\nCannot surpass them.\n\nGreatness cannot be sought through outward form.\nGreatness does not rely on outward form\nYet fully realizes its use,\nThus its greatness is beyond measure.\nOnly through benevolence\nCan one save all things.\nWhen things lose their place,\nEven if they tread on water and fire,\nOr rush toward blades—\nThey would not hesitate.\nThis is not the courage of a single man\nThat can match it.\n\nOnly through frugality\nCan one truly give.\nFor the more meager my desires,\nThe broader my giving—\nThis is not the greatness without purpose\nThat can match it.\n\nOnly by not daring to act before the world\nCan one meet things without strain.\nFor not acting first,\nAll that is done is merely in response.\nResponding without leading,\nAction does not originate from me.\nThough I act, no one blames me—\nThis is not the stirring of strife or creation of affairs\nThat can match it.\n\nCourage depends on benevolence,\nThus its vigor is unexhausted.\nAbundance depends on frugality,\nThus its breadth knows no end.\nLeading depends on following,\nThus its firstness is unstoppable.\nIf one relies only on courage,\nOnly on abundance,\nOnly on acting first,\nThen by the end of the day he shall die.\n\nNow, arms—\nThey are the most ominous of instruments.\nIf not rooted in benevolence,\nTo save the people from water and fire,\nTo make them know that all who kill are not benevolent,\nI have not seen their worth.\nI use benevolence to save the people,\nAnd Heaven too shall use benevolence to shield them.\n\n**The Art of Governance (Chapter 68)**\nThe skilled in governance are not martial,\nThe skilled in war do not rage,\nThe skilled in defeating enemies do not contend,\nThe skilled in using people place them below.\n\nThis is called the virtue of non-contention,\nThis is called the power of using people,\nThis is called aligning with Heaven—\nThe ultimate of the ancients.\nThe sage does not even possess a self,\nHow much less would he contend.\nBecause he does not contend,\nAll that he responds to\nIs what he cannot help but do.\n\nThus, when he is a scholar, he is not martial,\nWhen he wages war, he does not rage,\nWhen he defeats enemies, he does not need to contend with them,\nWhen he uses people, he does not need to place himself above them.\nTherefore, he can serve the people with virtue,\nAnd the people will gladly die for him—\nThis is called aligning with Heaven,\nThe ultimate of the ancients.\n\n**The Use of Arms (Chapter 69)**\nThe use of arms has its words:\nI do not dare to be the host while being the guest,\nI do not dare to advance an inch while retreating a foot.\n\nThis is called *xíng wú xíng* (action without action),\n*rǎng wú bì* (repelling without arms),\n*chéng wú dí* (withstanding without enemies),\n*zhí wú bīng* (seizing without arms).\n\nNo disaster is greater than underestimating the enemy,\nFor underestimating the enemy\nNearly forfeits my treasures.\nThus, when armies clash and add to each other’s woes,\nThe one who laments will win.\n\nDuke Ling of Wei asked Confucius about warfare.\nConfucius replied:\n*The matter of offerings and sacrifices,\nI have heard of them.\nBut military affairs,\nI have not studied them.*\nAs for his own words:\n*I fight and conquer,\nI sacrifice and receive blessings.*\n\nMencius also said:\n*If the present-day rulers of states\nWere to practice the kingly Dao,\nThen the people of neighboring states\nWould look up to them as to parents.\nYet they would lead their sons and brothers\nTo attack their own parents—\nSince the birth of the people,\nThere has never been one who could succeed in this.*\n\nThe words of Confucius and Mencius are no more than this.\nLaozi said:\n*I do not dare to be the host while being the guest,\nI do not dare to advance an inch while retreating a foot.*\nHe also said:\n*Arms are the most ominous of instruments;\nHe who delights in killing cannot fulfill his ambitions in the world.*\n\nFollowing this reasoning,\nIt is also what Confucius meant—\nI have not heard Mencius speak of the kingly Dao.*",

      "translated_text": "When forced to wage war, it is as though one walks without feet, seizes without arms, fights without weapons, and grasps without hands. This is what Confucius meant by *\"I fight and conquer,\"* and what Mencius meant by *\"There has never been one who could succeed in this.\"*\n\nThe Sage’s use of arms is always a last resort. How could there be a heart to seek victory through reckless daring? If I were to dare lightly and yet act upon it, then war would originate from me. Should I fail, the people would not justify their ruler. Thus, when arms are used, one must resist with endurance, persist with patience, and not exploit the people violently—then victory is certain.\n\nMy words are easy to know, easy to practice.\nYet none in the world can know them, none can practice them.\n\nWords have their root; actions have their master.\nOnly because of ignorance does the world fail to know me.\nFew know me, and thus I am honored.\nTherefore, the Sage wears coarse cloth while cherishing jade.\n\nThe Great Dao is easy to know, easy to practice—\nYet also difficult to know, difficult to practice.\nWhat is called \"easy to know\" is:\nNo Dao to speak of, no learning to pursue,\nNo action to take, no affairs to attend—\nHow could it not be easy to know, easy to practice?\n\nYet the Ultimate Way cannot be spoken of—\nFor words are all false.\nLearning cannot be learned—\nFor the moment the mind moves, it is already false.\n\"Doing without doing\"—\nYet the one who remains still may not truly be so.\n\"Acting without acting\"—\nYet the one who busies himself all day may not truly be idle.\nThis is why it is difficult—\nAnd why none in the world can know or practice it.\n\nThe Sage’s words have their root; his actions have their master.\nThus, what is spoken here may have its meaning elsewhere;\nWhat is done may seem right, yet the heart differs.\nTo know the root of words is to see their differences clearly;\nTo know the master of actions is to judge their differences without doubt.\n\nOnly because people are ignorant do they fail to know me.\nOnly because they do not know me am I honored.\nIf my knowledge were no different from theirs,\nThen my worth would not be distinguished.\n\n**Chapter 71: Knowing the Unknown**\nTo know the unknown is supreme;\nTo not know the known is sickness.\nOnly by recognizing sickness as sickness\nDoes one avoid it.\nThe Sage does not fall ill\nBecause he recognizes sickness as sickness—\nThus he does not fall ill.\nThe wise chase after things,\nSo they accumulate falsehood.\nThe ignorant return to the root,\nSo they approach truth.\nIf one can recognize that not knowing is near truth,\nAnd that knowing is full of falsehood,\nThen he is supreme.\n\nIf one does not recognize knowing as falsehood\nBut instead only increases his knowledge,\nThen he uses sickness as medicine—\nAnd his sickness is beyond measure.\nOnly by recognizing knowing as sickness\nDoes one avoid it.\nThis is how the Sage does not fall ill—\nBecause he knows it.\n\n**Chapter 72: The People Do Not Fear Authority**\nIf the people do not fear authority,\nThen true authority will arise.\nDo not confine their dwelling,\nDo not exhaust their livelihood.\nOnly because they are not exhausted\nAre they not exhausted.\nThus the Sage knows himself but does not reveal himself,\nLoves himself but does not exalt himself.\nHence, he discards that and takes this.\n\nThose who seek to make others fear and love them\nAre all inwardly lacking yet outwardly covetous.\nThe Sage is complete within,\nSo others’ joy does not benefit him,\nAnd their lack of fear does not harm him—\nThus he remains detached from all.\n\nIt is easy to make others fear me,\nBut difficult to make them not fear me.\nIt is easy to make me forget others,\nBut difficult to make the world forget me.\nIf the people do not fear authority,\nIt is because none in the world forgets me.\nIs this not what is called the威 of virtue and Dao?\n\nThe Sage’s encounter with things\nFollows their nature and finds ease.\nThus he does not confine their dwelling,\nNor exhaust their livelihood.\nFor what they dwell in and live on\nAre not their true selves.\nI alone am self-exhausted,\nSo none exhausts my life.\nThis is because I know myself yet do not reveal my knowing,\nLove myself yet do not exalt my love.\nIf I had a heart of self-revelation and self-exaltation,\nThen I would confine my dwelling,\nExhaust my livelihood—\nAnd could not endure even a day.\n\n**Chapter 73: Courage in Daring and Not Daring**\nCourage in daring leads to killing;\nCourage in not daring leads to life.\nThese two—one beneficial, one harmful—\nAre what Heaven detests.\nWho knows their reason?\n\nThus even the Sage finds them difficult.\nThe Way of Heaven\nConquers without contention, yet is effortless;\nResponds without striving, yet is timely.\nComes without being summoned, yet is well-planned.\nThe Heavenly net is vast—\nWide yet never loses a thread.\n\nAll know courage in daring,\nBut none know courage in not daring.\nCourage in daring is to tread upon white blades;\nCourage in not daring is to tread the Middle Way.\nThus it is said:\nWhite blades may be trodden,\nBut the Middle Way cannot be attained.\n\nComparing the two—\nTreading white blades brings harm, yet men lightly esteem its harm;\nTreading the Middle Way brings benefit, yet men do not know its benefit.\nThis is why the Middle Way is difficult.\n\nLightness in using courage is what men envy.\nWhat Heaven detests—\nWho knows its reason?\nEven the Sage finds it difficult—\nHow much more so the common people?\n\nFor the Way of Heaven\nConquers without contention, yet is effortless;\nSpeaks without words, yet is responsive;\nComes without being summoned, yet is well-planned.\nYet it especially detests the use of courage.\n\nMen, knowing that Heaven has not yet conquered,\nThat Heaven has not yet responded,\nThat its coming has not yet arrived,\nThat its planning is not yet fixed,\nSpeak boldly—\nAnd sometimes the strong prevail, the brave win.\nBut observe it later, and then you will know:\nThe Heavenly net is vast—\nWide yet never loses a thread.\n\n**Chapter 74: The People Do Not Fear Death**\nIf the people do not fear death,\nHow can you frighten them with death?\nIf you make the people always fear death,\nAnd execute those who act strangely,\nWho dares?\nThere are always officials who execute.\nHe who substitutes for the executioner\nIs called one who takes the place of the master carpenter to wield the axe.",

      "translated_text": "He who substitutes for the executioner—\nFew escape uninjured hands.\n\nThis chapter speaks of how the world’s punishments are insufficient to rely upon for governance.\n\nIf the people do not fear death,\nHow can I frighten them with death?\nIf I make the people truly fear death,\nAnd seize and kill those who act strangely,\nThen killing one man would suffice for governance.\nYet the more one kills, the more ungovernable it becomes—\nThus, punishments are insufficient to rely upon.\n\nThe Qin enforced strict laws, their nets tight,\nYet their crimes were unchecked.\nThe Han relaxed their laws, their nets let through fish as large as boats,\nYet the world turned to the Han.\nThis too is evident.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven rewards virtue and punishes licentiousness—\nThose who execute, in the unseen, cannot escape.\nIf one insists on substituting for the executioner,\nLike one who takes the place of the master carpenter to wield the axe,\nThere has never been one who did not injure his hand.\n\n**Chapter 75: The People’s Hunger**\nThe people’s hunger stems from their rulers’ excessive taxation.\nThe people’s difficulty in governing arises from their rulers’ interference—\nThus, they are difficult to govern.\nThe people’s indifference to death comes from their rulers’ lavish living—\nThus, they treat death lightly.\nOnly those who do not cling to life are wiser than those who prize it.\nThe more the ruler takes, the poorer the people become;\nThe more the ruler acts, the more the people are disordered—\nThis is inevitable.\nIf I seek to enrich their lives,\nYet disregard their lives,\nIf I am rich while they are poor,\nHow can they not treat death lightly?\nThe Sage regards life as a necessity.\nHow could he enrich his own life while depriving others of theirs?\nThis is called wiser than valuing life.\n\n**Chapter 76: On Human Life**\nHuman life is soft and weak,\nYet death is hard and strong.\nAll things—grasses and trees—\nAre soft and fragile when alive,\nYet wither and decay when dead.\nThus, the strong and rigid are the companions of death,\nWhile the soft and weak are the companions of life.\nTherefore, armies that are strong do not conquer,\nTrees that are rigid snap,\nThe strong and great are beneath,\nThe soft and weak are above.\nThis chapter broadly speaks of how the soft and weak must live,\nAnd the rigid and strong must die.\nThough softness and weakness are not the Dao itself,\nThey approach *wuwei* (non-action).\nThough rigidity and strength have not strayed from the Dao,\nThey verge on *youwei* (action).\n*Wuwei* does not stray far from the Dao,\nBut *youwei* brings fortune and misfortune, regret and blame—\nThus, it strays further from the Dao.\n\n**Chapter 77: The Dao of Heaven**\nThe Dao of Heaven—\nIs it not like drawing a bow?\nThe high are lowered, the low are raised,\nThe excessive are diminished, the deficient are supplemented.\nThe Dao of Heaven supplements the deficient and diminishes the excessive.\nBut the Dao of humanity is not so.\nIt diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive.\nWho can use their excess to nourish the world?\nOnly the Sage.\nThus, the Sage acts yet does not rely upon it,\nCompletes his work yet does not dwell upon it,\nDoes not desire to be seen as virtuous.\nTo take from the many to benefit the few—\nThis is the Dao of Heaven.\nTo take from the few to benefit the many—\nThis is the Dao of humanity.\nOnly the Sage can further use his own excess to nourish others’ deficiencies,\nThus, his power extends to all things without relying on his power,\nHis achievements cover the world yet he does not claim them,\nHis benefits flow to the world yet he does not boast of his virtue—\nOnly the Sage can do this.\n\n**Chapter 78: The World’s Softness and Weakness**\nNothing in the world is softer or weaker than water,\nYet nothing can surpass it in overcoming the rigid and strong.\nIt has no equal.\nThe weak overcoming the strong,\nThe soft overcoming the rigid—\nAll know this, yet none can practice it.\nThus, the Sage says:\n*\"To bear the nation’s filth is to be its sovereign.\"*\n*\"To bear the nation’s misfortunes is to be its king.\"*\nWater has no sentiment,\nYet it overcomes the rigid with its softness—\nHow much more so for things with sentiment?\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"You, all the myriad regions, have guilt—\nIt lies with me alone.\nMy guilt alone—\nDo not involve the myriad regions.\"*\nThe Three Dynasties once governed the people with this virtue.\nThis is called bearing the nation’s filth,\nBearing the nation’s misfortunes.\n\n**Chapter 79: Reconciling Great Grievances**\nTo reconcile great grievances will only leave lingering grievances—\nHow can this be considered good?\nThus, the Sage holds only the left contract,\nAnd does not demand repayment from others.\nTherefore, those with virtue oversee the contracts,\nThose without oversee the reckoning.\nThe Dao of Heaven favors none—\nIt always sides with the virtuous.\nGrievances cannot be reconciled,\nJust as fire cannot be cooled,\nOr water cannot be heated.\nIf one forces reconciliation,\nThere will surely be lingering grievances.\nTo consider this good is insufficient.\nThus, the Sage governs the world\nAs one who holds the left contract and seeks only the left contract—\nWhere do my favors and grievances come from?\nIt is like the matching of contracts and seals—\nIf they do not fit, one does not force what is not there,\nNor does one demand what is not owed.\nThe Sage’s governance of the world\nIs like the overseer of contracts seeking perfect alignment—\nGreat or small, long or short—\nHe knows the contracts will fit on their own,\nYet he harbors no private bias.\nIf one insists on forcing a match,\nThat is the overseer of reckonings, not of contracts.\nThe Dao of Heaven is the same.\nThe Dao of Heaven favors none—\nIt never fails to reward the virtuous—\nFor it is merely the overseer of contracts.\n\n**Chapter 80: Small States, Few People**\nIn small states with few people,\nLet there be ten or a hundred skilled craftsmen, yet they are unused.\nLet the people value life so much that they do not migrate far.\nThough there are boats and carriages, they have no use for them.\nThough there are arms and armor, they have no place to display them.\nLet the people return to knotted cords for record-keeping.\nLet their food be savory, their clothing beautiful,\nTheir dwellings secure, their customs joyful.\nNeighboring states are visible, the sounds of roosters and dogs are heard,\nYet the people die of old age without ever traveling to one another.\n\nIn small states with few people,\nThe talents of ten or a hundred are employed.\nIf the talents of ten or a hundred are employed,\nThen great talents are discarded.\nIf the people hold life lightly,\nThey will migrate far without hesitation—\nIf they migrate without hesitation, they will do whatever they please.\nIf there are ten or a hundred skilled craftsmen yet they are unused,\nIf the people cherish life and do not migrate far,\nThen though there are boats and carriages, they have no use for them,\nThough there are arms and armor, they have no place to display them,\nYet governance can return to knotted cords—\nThis too is acceptable.",
