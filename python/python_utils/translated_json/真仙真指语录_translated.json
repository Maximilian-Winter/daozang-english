Two fascicles.*\n*Source text: Zhengtong Daoist Canon, Orthodox Section, Part One.*\n\n---\n\n**True Immortals’ Direct Pointers: Recorded Sayings, Fascicle One**\n*Compiled by Xuanquanzi, the Daoist of Autumn Moon over Sea and Sky*\n\n**Recorded Sayings of the Perfected Immortal Ma of Danyang**\n\nAt the Chongyang Assembly on Dragon Gate Mountain, the Master of Danyang addressed the assembly, saying:\n\nIn daily life, one must not deceive the three powers of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity. Always act with reverent care, for even an inch of time is precious—do not squander it.\n\nSleep is a human desire, yet it must be moderated. Do not devote yourself solely to seated meditation; in movement, stillness, sitting, and standing, so long as the mind is settled, all is the Dao.\n\nGentlemen, do not stir the mind or rouse thoughts. Swiftly seek your nature and life, but if you can only calm the mind and dispel desires, you are already an immortal.\n\nDo not harbor doubts—these are true and authentic words. Only constant purity and stillness are difficult to practice. Yet once you awaken to the emptiness of the myriad phenomena, the mind clarifies itself, desires dispel themselves, nature stabilizes itself, life abides itself, the elixir coalesces itself, and immortality is achieved itself. No one else can do this for you.\n\nEach of you must apply effort without haste, ever at ease and free. Had my master not revealed this, I would not have dared to recognize it as the wondrous method. Now that I have attained its efficacy, I transmit it to others.\n\nGentlemen, simply set aside doubt and abide in the principle of non-action, purity, and spontaneity. Do not stir the fires of passion, and you will have attained the Dao.\n\nHe further said:\n\nThe celestial Dao revolves ceaselessly through the twelve hours, driving the transformations of creation—does it ever rest? Those who practice the Dao must emulate the celestial Dao, never pausing for even a moment in the twelve hours, but revolving the transformations within their own bodies. They must remain perpetually pure and still, without the slightest dust of thought—this is cultivation. If you practice thus, you will become an immortal in days. But if you falter in effort or conduct, how can you attain liberation?\n\nI observe that among you, not one maintains single-minded devotion to the Dao for even a single hour. How then can you become immortals? Having received offerings from the ten directions, how will you repay them? When your eyes close in death, you will fall into the Dark Realm, suffering for kalpas without end. I now urge you: let me tell you what the Dao is.\n\nSimply calm the mind and dispel desires, leaving no thread of the myriad phenomena entangled. When spirit and qi harmonize and ascend, this is the Dao. Follow this practice, and you will not err.\n\nIf you fail to practice thus, do not blame the patriarchs or perfected masters. Do you not recall how the Seven Ancestors, in their lifetimes, created boundless karma and endured limitless suffering, hoping their descendants would attain the Dao, relying on Heaven’s mercy to deliver them to rebirth in the celestial realms?\n\nI bow to my disciples beneath this gate: from this day forward, do not waste time. Endure without retreat, embrace the Dao and return—this is my vow.\n\nHe further said:\n\nDiminish flavors to nourish qi,\nDiscard anger to nurture nature,\nEndure humiliation and lowliness to cultivate virtue,\nGuard purity and stillness to cultivate the Dao.\nLet your name not be bound to registers,\nLet your heart not dwell in the world—\nThis is how one sheds the mortal shell and becomes a companion of Heaven.\n\nHe further said:\n\nDevoting oneself wholly to the Dao, anyone may attain it. Immortals differ from worldly people in that their progress is not subject to rise and fall. Yet non-action and purity are the highest and most effortless vehicle.\n\nHe further said:\n\nThe subtlety of the Daoist lies in nothing more than nurturing qi. People drowned in profit and fame often dissipate their qi. For those who study the Dao, there is no other task but to attain utmost purity and stillness, to preserve spirit and nurture qi.\n\nWhen the heart’s fluid descends and kidney qi ascends to the spleen, thoughts cease, spirit becomes numinous, the elixir coalesces, and immortality is achieved. If one cannot carry Mount Tai under the arm and leap over the Northern Sea, it is not the Dao.\n\nHe further said:\n\nThe Dao is simply purity, stillness, non-action, and freedom—untainted and unattached. If you can practice this thoroughly in the twelve hours, you will not be led astray.\n\nHe further said:\n\nQi is difficult to stabilize, swift as a galloping horse. Only stillness can govern it. First, abandon external distractions. Even amidst crowds, remain as if in a deep mountain valley—this is the mark of a Daoist. Without reaching the state of no-mind, it is difficult to control.\n\nHe further said:\n\nGuard purity and tranquility to nurture the Dao;\nEndure humiliation and lowliness to cultivate virtue;\nDiscard anger and extinguish ignorance to nurture nature;\nModerate diet and diminish flavors to nurture qi.\nThen, when nature is settled, emotions fade;\nWhen form is empty, qi circulates;\nWhen the heart dies, spirit lives;\nWhen yang flourishes, yin wanes—\nThis is the natural principle.\n\nHe further said:\n\nIn the Dao, whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying, one must not depart from it for even a moment.\nIn walking, place your feet on level ground;\nIn standing, concentrate spirit in the Great Void;\nIn sitting, regulate breath to be soft and continuous;\nIn lying, sink spirit into the secluded valley.\nWith long practice and no interruption, you will seem dull-witted all day.\n\nHe further said:\n\nEach day, ensure that in every matter, there is nothing to attend to. Release the myriad threads, close the six gates to prevent entry. Speak little, cling to nothing. In the twelve hours, remain ever unwavering. Reduce sleep, set everything aside.\n\nThough there are six gates, there is but one master. When nothing remains, this is restoration.\n\nHe further said:\n\nFor beginners entering the Dao, from this day forward, let worldly affairs no longer occupy the mind. Devote yourself wholeheartedly, steadfast to the end—never abandon the path midway. If even the slightest trace remains unremoved, the Dao will not be firm.\n\nDo not dwell on past events, nor anticipate the future. Simply attend to the present moment—this is a person without cares. Those entangled in affection for children and family, with little resolve for the Dao’s radiance, are not true Dao-seekers.\n\nHe further said:\n\nListen to my words: do not forget the inner and outer applications of daily life.\n\nThe outer daily practice forbids seeing others’ faults, boasting of one’s own virtue, disparaging the worthy, envying the capable, stirring worldly thoughts, or harboring desires—all such transgressions. The inner daily practice is true purity and true stillness, unstained and unattached, regulating qi and nurturing spirit, carefree and at ease, silently accumulating merit and conduct, seeking no recognition from others, only hoping for Heaven’s witness.\n\nA poem says:\nThe great Dao stands far from worldly passions,\nNon-doing is the wondrous foundation.\nIn the world, love no things,\nAnd vexations will not follow.\n\nHe further said: As for purity and stillness—purity means purifying the heart-source, stillness means quieting the sea of qi. When the heart-source is pure, external things cannot disturb it, and nature settles into spirit-brightness. When the sea of qi is still, wayward desires cannot arise, essence is preserved, and the abdomen is full. Thus, to clarify the heart is like clarifying water—all things reflect themselves. To nurture qi is like protecting an infant—allow no harm. When qi penetrates, spirit becomes numinous; when spirit is numinous, qi transforms—this is the attainment of purity and stillness.\n\nHe further said: As for non-doing—one must not indulge in thoughts of love, caution, profit, or harm. In this way, though one acts, one remains ever non-doing; though one engages in affairs, one remains ever without affairs. How much more so when one single-mindedly purifies the heart and stills the intent, nurtures qi and preserves spirit, drifting lightly through the realm of carefree wandering, arriving at the land of nothing-whatsoever.\n\nHe further said: If one practices with a mind and with doing, it is all mere technique. If one practices without mind and without doing, it is boundless clarity and emptiness.\n\nHe further said: Wine is the brew that disorders nature; meat is the substance that severs life. One must abstain entirely—this is best. Violations of wine and meat may yet be forgiven, but violations of lust are crimes beyond pardon. The harm of lust’s vessel is more severe than wolves and tigers: it ruins fine conduct, damages good deeds, depletes essence, extinguishes spirit, and even harms the body—thus it is the great sin of Dao-seekers.\n\nHe further said: The great Dao takes non-mind as its essence, forgetting words as its function, softness and weakness as its root, purity and stillness as its foundation. Applied to body and mind, it means moderating diet, cutting off thoughts, sitting in stillness to regulate breath, and resting tranquilly to nurture qi. When the heart does not wander, nature is settled; when the body is not wearied, essence is preserved; when spirit is not disturbed, the elixir coalesces. Then, extinguishing passions in emptiness and calming spirit to the utmost, one may be said to attain the wondrous Dao without leaving one’s door. Since ancient times, immortals have never dared to leap past the two words “clarity and stillness”—these are profound words indeed. The scripture says: Clarify the heart, and spirit will naturally become clear. Many practitioners speak of clarifying the heart but do not understand the principle of clarifying the heart. What is the principle of clarifying the heart? It is simply that not a single thought arises, the nature-body is truly empty, utterly serene and still, like the sky’s clarity without distinction—this is true heart-clarification. When no heart remains to be clarified, this is called clarifying the heart.\n\nMoreover, the numinous source and wondrous awareness are originally pure and still, but because the ten thousand dusts pollute the still water, when dust is abundant, the water becomes turbid, and when thoughts are many, nature darkens. Thus, clarifying the heart and reducing affairs, the water becomes clear of itself, and nature becomes bright of itself. When the light of clarity is shallow, movement stirs dust; when the light of clarity is deep, even if wind and waves surge, the water does not muddy. This is like the measure of a person’s skill. In learning the Dao, one does not value empty practice or empty conduct. Without examining one’s own clarity or turbidity, one often takes the ancients’ words as one’s own use, then claims that originally there is no cultivation and no attainment. Though the nature of the Dao is indeed without cultivation and without attainment, the dusty heart must daily be diminished. Only when heart and nature are forgotten does one accord with no-cultivation and no-attainment. Thus the *Daode Jing* says: In pursuing the Dao, daily diminish, diminish again and again, until one reaches non-doing. So it is.\n\nSince ancient times, those who learn the Dao, when they embody true emptiness and attain the true stability of non-mind, only then speak of spontaneity. But how is the embodiment of emptiness to be understood? The embodiment of emptiness means the heart’s thoughts are extinguished, all thoughts utterly cut off, within there is nothing known, without there is nothing perceived, within and without both still, form and emptiness both dissolved. The eye sees its colors but is not attached to them; the ear hears its sounds but does not perceive them. Thus, when sounds and colors cannot enter, nature naturally gathers itself into nature, merging into profound obscurity, transforming into a single point of numinous light, inwardly and outwardly fused—only at this point does one accord with the Dao of spontaneous embodiment of emptiness.\n\nAs for the spontaneous embodiment of emptiness: if there is something to embody, it is not embodiment; if there is nothing to embody, there is nothing not embodied. Have you not heard the *Record of Learning Immortality*? It says: Little do they know that the ultimate of the supreme Dao is dim and silent, without gate or side, open and bright in all four directions. If there is somewhere it is, then there is somewhere it is not; if there is nowhere it is, then there is nowhere it is not. It also says: If the body does not labor, merit is not great; if conduct is not extensive, the heart does not die. Some exert effort in the teachings, stirring great dust and toil; some work on the ground of the heart, completely casting aside worldly affairs—these two are the highest in the Dao. Yet, though one has left the household, if the heart has not died, one must not waste time in the interim. Accumulate merit and pile up conduct, single-minded and selfless, unwavering until death, turning toward the teachings and forgetting them, ceasing to generate delusive thoughts. The ancestral master said: Leave it to Heaven to decide. So it is.\n\nThe master was in Huating and said: What is the Dao? Qi itself is the root-origin—do you not know that what issues from the nostrils is it?\n\nHe further said: The Dao simply requires purity, stillness, non-doing, carefree wandering, non-staining, and non-attachment. If one can thoroughly chew and break through these twelve words, one becomes a thoroughly enlightened Daoist. Just trust the words of this old man, practice them, and you will naturally benefit—it will surely not mislead you young ones.\n\nHe further said: The master was at Gaoma Congren’s hut in the west of the county and loudly declared: Even if one spends ten thousand taels of gold a day, it is best to wear coarse clothes and eat plain food. Last year, passing beyond the pass, I heard someone recite these words and admired their truth, so I recorded them.\n\nThe Master said: *The Scripture of Purity and Stillness* states, \"If a person can always be pure and still, Heaven and Earth will all return to them.\" Here, \"Heaven and Earth\" do not refer to the external heavens above and earth below, but rather to the Heaven and Earth within the body. Above the human body is Heaven; below it is Earth. If the heavenly *qi* descends and the earthly pulse flows freely, with harmony between above and below, the true *qi* will naturally be secure.\n\nHe further said: The Confucians say, \"Repay virtue with virtue, repay resentment with uprightness.\" Master Jin of Jin said, \"Bind friendships with trust, repay kindness with kindness.\" This is perfection.\n\nHe also said: \"Having no mind\" does not mean being like cats, dogs, wood, or stone—stupidly without mind. It means dwelling in the realm of purity and stillness, free from wayward thoughts. Thus, the common person lacks a mind of purity and stillness, while the Daoist lacks a mind of worldly defilement. This does not mean both are equally mindless, like wood, stone, cats, or dogs.\n\nHe further said: \"Seeing the Tathāgata as neither arising nor ceasing, when one awakens to this, one escapes rebirth.\" Master Qiu said: This is the emergence of the *yin* spirit. If, upon reaching the Heavenly Court, celestial flowers suddenly fly, then the *yang* spirit emerges. This is the first stage.\n\nGong Daosheng asked: \"What of utter stillness and constant quiescence?\" The Master replied: \"Even 'utter stillness' and 'constant quiescence' are to be discarded in the end.\"\n\nYu Qingfeng asked: \"Disciple has practiced for several years, yet my Dao-eye remains unclear and my mind-ground dull. Why is this?\" The Master said: \"There is no other reason—your practice is simply not refined enough.\"\n\nThe Master said: Those who study the Dao need not read extensively, for it confuses the mind and hinders Daoist cultivation. Even reading works like *Master Heshang’s Commentary on the Dao De Jing* or *Jinlingzi’s Commentary on the Yin Fu Jing* from time to time is not harmful, but it is better to read nothing at all. Sit in utter stillness and nurture *qi*—this is the highest teaching.\n\nHe further said: The *qi* within the body must not be scattered; the spirit within the mind must not be obscured.\n\nSomeone asked: \"How can one keep the *qi* from scattering?\" The Master said: \"By non-doing in the body.\"\n\nAnother asked: \"How can one keep the spirit from being obscured?\" The Master said: \"By having no affairs in the mind.\"\n\nThe Master said: Zhang Runzi had a fine saying. Whenever he traveled, he would say, \"Simply attend to the treasure that nourishes the body.\" The Master laughed and said: \"He runs a shop yet urges others to do so.\"\n\nHe also said: A poem goes, *\"Deeply hiding white snow is not prized—widely planting yellow sprouts is not poverty.\"* To nurture *qi* and preserve spirit, one must cast aside all distractions, maintain purity inside and out, guard it steadfastly, and use it without strain. After three years without leakage, the lower elixir congeals; after six years, the middle elixir congeals; after nine years, the great elixir congeals. When fully perfected, this is the ninefold-transmuted elixir, also called the completion of three thousand merits.\n\nHe further cited *The Ten Admonitions*:\n1. Do not violate the laws of the state.\n2. When meeting fellow Daoists, greet them first with bows. Regard all men and women as parents, for even those in the six paths of rebirth are your parents.\n3. Sever ties with wine, lust, wealth, anger, right and wrong, self and others.\n4. Eliminate worry, sorrow, thought, attachment, and love. If a single念 arises, swiftly dispel it. Search for your own faults at all hours. If you sense any bias, correct it immediately.\n5. Treat favor with caution; do not feign goodness to accept others’ offerings.\n6. Restrain the fire of ignorance. Always practice forbearance, repay wrongs with kindness, and act without selfishness toward all things.\n7. Be cautious in speech, moderate in diet, reduce flavors, abandon glory, and cut off love and hatred.\n8. Do not pursue strange or wondrous matters. Remain in your proper place, live by alms, and avoid the slightest worldly toil.\n9. Do not dwell in a hermitage with more than three rooms or keep more than three companions. If illness strikes, support one another. If you die, I will bury you; if I die, you will bury me. If there is something you do not understand, teach one another without harboring ill will.\n10. Do not harbor competitive thoughts. Always act for others’ benefit, even at your own expense. Though in seclusion, conduct yourself as if before sages. Embrace poverty, gentleness, and humility toward others. Live simply, free from greed and stinginess. Be carefree and at ease, with your resolve fixed on cultivation. Be steadfast from beginning to end, never lazy. A pure, non-doing mind is true; a clean, non-evil intent is good. Nurture *qi* and preserve spirit, always arouse compassion. Quietly accumulate merit, not seeking others’ recognition, but hoping only for Heaven’s awareness.\n\nMaster Tan of Changzhen’s recorded teachings to disciples:\nAll people revolve in the cycle of rebirth, ceaselessly born and dying—all because they have a mind. Deshan said: \"When the mind arises, myriad dharmas arise; when the mind ceases, myriad dharmas cease.\" If not a single念 arises, one transcends birth and death.\n\nWhat is \"having a mind\"? It is because sentient beings are bound by the three poisons of greed, hatred, and delusion, igniting the fire of ignorance. The Master said: \"Leap beyond the three mountains’ gate\"—this is it.\n\nThus, the awakened practitioner severs emotions and abandons love, breaks down arrogance and sharpness, subdues and eliminates the unwholesome minds of sentient beings, and seeks to see the true nature from before parents’ birth—the original face.\n\nWhat is the \"unwholesome mind\"? It is the arising of ignorance, greed, jealousy, and attachment to wealth and lust in all circumstances, along with endless calculations and ceaseless arising and ceasing of thoughts. Bound by these karmic obstructions and familiar old states, the true source is obscured, and liberation is unattainable. Only by completely eliminating them can one see one’s own nature.\n\nWhat does \"seeing one’s own nature\" mean? It is to remain pure and still in every念 throughout the twelve hours, not allowing old attachments to obscure the true source. Abide constantly like empty space, carefree and at ease, with spirit and *qi* naturally harmonizing. If one completes this one task in cultivation, what birth and death is there to fear? What sins and karma are there to dread?\n\nIf even a single念 arises that is not pure and still, it becomes an obstacle—this is not called freedom. How can one attain this?\n\nOnly if all of you remain as steadfast as a mountain, unwavering and unshaken, advancing without ever looking back—even when encountering great demons—will you surely fulfill your vow in this lifetime. As Immortal Jin said: *\"A clear mind and tranquil intent are the path to heaven; a scattered mind and wild thoughts are the gate to hell.\"*\n\nFrom the recorded sayings of Immortal Liu of Longevity:\nWhen the mind penetrates one thing, it transcends one material shell; when it penetrates ten thousand things, it transcends ten thousand material shells, thereby realizing the Dao of emptiness and nothingness. If one does not penetrate but instead dwells in non-action, the mind becomes mere stagnant emptiness—though it may appear sagely, the world will recognize it as such.\n\nThe Most High said: *\"Those who can beg for food are my disciples.\"* In begging, one receives the kindness of others, yet the body is not at ease. For kalpas uncounted, the bones of the dead have piled like mountains, the mind-monkey never resting for even a moment. Only when karmic obstructions are fully dissolved can merit be seen.\n\nWhen one awakens to the harmony of *qi* and the settling of spirit, the natural and eternal Dao is attained. If one clings to a single scripture as the whole of cultivation, this is not yet the truth. To attain an unimpeded mind, one must penetrate the thousand scriptures and ten thousand treatises—yet without attachment. When the mind’s spirit is luminous and all is illuminated, then true understanding arises.\n\nThe Dao is formless and traceless, yet many doubt whether it has a beginning or an end. If the mind is free of selfishness and constantly pure, one who fully embodies this is a person of the Dao—these two words, \"pure stillness,\" encompass all.\n\nThe Most High said: *\"Even I, with hair turned white, cannot preserve the body whole.\"* The body belongs to the realm of the ten thousand things—how can one rely on this borrowed form to seek immortality and escape death? What has form must decay; what is formless does not decay. When the mind awakens, perverse desires do not arise; when wisdom shines, it is never extinguished. The primordial spirit then manifests, life is preserved and enduring, and the Three Powers (Heaven, Earth, Humanity) merge into the void, returning to oneness, completing the work of nature.\n\nIt is also said: *\"When the cultivator’s spirit and *qi* meet, they become immortals.\"* Someone asked: *\"How can spirit and *qi* meet?\"* Each person offered different theories, none grasping the principle.\n\nThe Master said: To understand the myriad dharmas, one must transcend the shells of the ten thousand things. When one-tenth of the dust-like mind is eliminated, one-tenth of the Dao is illuminated; when all dust is eliminated, the Dao is fully illuminated. If the dust-mind is entirely extinguished, one’s nature is perfected; if the desire-mind is entirely extinguished, one’s life is perfected; if the mind of ignorance is entirely extinguished, the harmony of primordial *qi* is preserved.\n\nFor the cultivator, in each of the twelve hours, one must inwardly examine one’s own faults—only then can spirit and *qi* find inner peace. When spirit and *qi* are at peace, this is true merit; when one does not see the faults of others, this is true conduct.\n\nOver long years of entering the Dao, one nurtures essence and *qi* within. When essence and *qi* flourish, spirit thinks of *qi*, and *qi* thinks of spirit—naturally, spirit and *qi* meet. Like earth and water mixed to form clay, shaped into vessels, if not fired in the true flame, when water meets earth again, it reverts to mud. But if fired in the true flame, the vessel becomes indestructible. Bricks and tiles, once fired, can last a thousand years—how much more so when the treasures of nature and life are refined to perfection?\n\nFrom the letter of Immortal Qiu Changchun to Daoist friends in the Western Regions:\nGenerally, those who cultivate the truth and aspire to the Dao must rely on accumulating merit and piling up virtue. Without suffering and sincere devotion, it is difficult to transcend the mundane and enter sagehood. Some exert effort in the teachings, stirring up worldly toil; others work on the ground of the mind, entirely abandoning worldly affairs. But as long as one restrains the self and preserves the mind for the Dao, this is the foundation of attaining blessings.\n\nYet the Dao encompasses heaven and earth, its vastness beyond measure—small virtues and minor merits are slow to show effect. Thus it is said: *\"A moment of awakening to the Dao depends on kalpas of tempering and polishing; sudden enlightenment of the one mind must rely on the complete cultivation of ten thousand practices.\"* The awakening of this life is the merit of past lives. Yet, unaware of past-life causes, one sees only years of arduous devotion without success, dismissing worldly toil as empty and false, then growing discouraged—this is most lamentable.\n\nIn truth, whether sitting, lying, standing, or walking, if the mind abides in the Dao, though the ground of the mind has not yet opened, every moment accumulates hidden merit. If merit is insufficient, the Dao is incomplete. Like a person possessing a priceless luminous pearl worth a million, if I wish to buy it but lack sufficient funds, I must work day and night, diligently and frugally, accumulating wealth—whether three or five thousand, or thirty or fifty thousand—though the sum is not yet complete and the pearl not yet obtained, the accumulated wealth can still be used in times of need. Compared to impoverished families, the difference is as vast as clouds and mud. Those who accumulate merit and virtue may not yet have attained the Dao, but their good roots are deep and weighty. In this life and future lives, sages and worthies will guide them. Compared to those without past roots, the distance is immeasurable.\n\nThe only danger is that people grow weary and slacken—then even sages cannot save them. If one does not retreat, in this life or future lives, over countless kalpas, they will be guided until enlightenment is achieved. I, lacking past-life roots, though I met an enlightened teacher, endured ten thousand hardships and a thousand pains—yet to this day, I have not attained realization. Dan Yang and Chang Zhen, both with past-life roots, achieved transcendence in ten or five years, soaring freely beyond the heavens. Though I have not yet attained, the hardships I endure are unlike those of ordinary people.\n\nThe Patriarch said: *\"The Dao of non-action first requires abandoning the home, then abandoning the body. When ill, let illness take its course; when dying, let death take its course. Until the final moment, hold fast to the Dao and perish—let heaven decide.\"* These are the ultimate words—students, take heed.\n\nHe also said: *\"You neither cultivate earnestly nor engage in worldly toil—how can you repay the offerings from the ten directions? If you left the household with good fortune, you cannot retreat; if you left without good fortune, you will inevitably falter and be forced to retreat, unable to succeed.\"*\n\nYu Qingfeng asked: *\"If the mind does not stray from the square inch, how is that?\"*\nThe Master replied: *\"This is true emptiness—difficult to speak, difficult to explain. When you eliminate one-tenth of your merit, you gain one-tenth of merit; when you eliminate nine thousand nine hundred and nine-tenths, if even one-tenth remains, it is not called purity and stillness. Only when all is eliminated will the sages examine your mind—then a true teacher will come to guide you.\"*\n\nHe also said: *\"The Heavenly True August One states: refining spirit, refining qi, refining form—when all three are accomplished, one becomes an official of Heaven or Fire, which is yang. Breath is wind. Using wind to blow upon fire for long refinement, both form and spirit attain subtlety. The ancients said: first, thoughts cease; second, breath ceases; third, the meridians cease; fourth, all is extinguished—entering great samādhi, untouched by phenomena, one becomes an ancient awl of seven hundred years. Wondrous! Wondrous! If, after seeing worldly toil, you engage in even slight practice, it remains external conduct. Do not seek it, do not avoid it; though responding to things, do not cling to them.\"*\n\nHe further said: *\"One who awakens to the Dao is like a farmer storing grain, from a single measure to ten thousand bushels. Or like a worldly person accumulating wealth, from a single coin to ten thousand strings. If you cherish qi without loss, the accumulation of qi will naturally become spirit.\"*\n\nHe also said: *\"The nature-body is empty and vast, only then can right mindfulness arise.\"*\n\nYu Qingfeng asked: *\"If one does not reach true emptiness, the yang spirit cannot emerge.\"*\nThe Master replied: *\"Without reaching true emptiness, even the yin spirit cannot emerge. Difficulties must be overcome—this is the work of merit and practice.\"*\n\nQingfeng said: *\"Refinement in stillness is good.\"*\nQiu said: *\"Refinement in bustle is even better. You younger ones need only observe the years, while subduing sensuality and desire. I endured seven years of bitter resolve, equal to seven lifetimes of others’ effort.\"*\n\nMaster Yao asked: *\"How to prevent leakage?\"*\nQiu said: *\"If the body attains true purity and true stillness, it will naturally not leak.\"*\n\nLiu Daojian asked: *\"In cultivation, the inner kidneys grow hot while the heart remains cold, and the whole body feels feverish—what is this?\"*\nQiu said: *\"The sages lift and guide you past it. Later, what you see with your eyes or hear with your ears must not be clung to.\"*\n\nHe also said: *\"In emptiness, you see only heads falling—this is the completion of the Golden Elixir.\"*\n\nSomeone asked: *\"How many years has Hu Cheng Wang been a renunciate?\"*\nHe replied: *\"Three years. You do not recognize characters—do not study texts and disturb your mind’s cultivation. First, devote three to five years of bitter resolve. Do not speak of right and wrong; only examine your own faults. Do not stir ignorance, do not crave splendor. Cut off greed and desire entirely, cast aside lust, and be free and unburdened—this is the Daoist.\"*\n\nHe also said: *\"When spirit is settled and qi harmonized, this is seeing one’s nature. It is as bright and clear as the moon, without blemish. If someone asks about form, answer with formlessness. If they ask about formlessness, answer with form. If form and formlessness intermingle, it is the mystery within mystery.\"*\n\nHe further said: *\"If merit and conduct are deficient, you will only return to Peng Island. After five hundred years, you must return to the world to accumulate merit. Merit in heaven is hard to accumulate; merit in the world is easy. The superior person attains the Dao, transcends the Three Realms, and does not dwell on Peng Island.\"*\n\nSomeone asked: *\"Is cultivation a matter of resolve, or do the sages lift and guide?\"*\nThe Master replied: *\"It depends entirely on resolve. Without resolve, how can the sages lift and guide?\"*\n\nAnother asked: *\"What is resolve?\"*\nHe said: *\"Not allowing thoughts to arise—this is resolve.\"*\n\nHe also said: *\"When first becoming a Daoist, endure seven or eight years of bitter resolve without retreat. Do not let stray thoughts arise. Do not forget your initial aspiration; let your determination grow stronger with each passing day. Though you encounter demons, do not fear—sages watch over you in secret and will not allow harm to one who cultivates. \"*\n\nSomeone asked about daily practice in inner and outer cultivation.\nQiu said: *\"Yield to others before yourself, restrain the self and return to propriety—this is outer daily practice. Forbear insults, endure hardship, cut off all thoughts, and let the mind rest in all things—this is inner daily practice.\"*\n\nThe next day, he was asked again about inner and outer daily practice.\nQiu said: *\"Put others before yourself, measure others by your own standards—this is outer daily practice. Cultivate in purity and stillness—this is inner daily practice.\"*\n\nHe also said: *\"Always keep the mind serene and clear. In all twelve hours, be ever-awake. Do not dull the nature; when the mind is settled and qi harmonized, this is true inner daily practice. Cultivate benevolence and accumulate virtue, endure hardship for others’ benefit—this is true outer daily practice.\"*\n\nHe further said: *\"What you hear with your ears or see with your eyes must not be clung to. Focus your mind on cultivation—sages will lift and guide you in secret. When you reach the state of settled spirit and harmonized qi, you may feel heat in the inner kidneys, a dark steam pervading the four great elements, dispersing after an hour or two, revealing visions of mountains, rivers, sun, and moon.\"*\n\nHe also said: *\"We have three times pierced the Gate of Heaven, and the sun and moon naturally descend straight down, revealing the myriad phenomena in all their splendor.\"* Having spoken, he regretted it.\n\nHe said: *\"Do not observe others.\"*\n\nHe further said: *\"There are those among Daoists who practice circulating qi in the cinnabar field—this is but a lower gate, suitable only for beginners of shallow capacity. When one’s nature reaches the void, vast and spiritually luminous, this is the Great Dao. Here is where one should begin in earnest, for it demands true and precise effort.\"*\n\nSomeone asked: *\"What of the practice of ‘unbroken breath’?\"*\n\nQiu replied: *\"Let it be as the tortoise’s breathing—this is the Daoist’s livelihood. Do not cling to it.\"*\n\nThe ancients said:\n*\"The divine water never leaves the body,\nThe Flower Pool renews itself each day.\nIf you can drink of it always,\nYou become a being of the Great Heavenly Net.\"*\n\nHe also recounted that in the days of Master Ma, there were those who sought to prolong life through cultivation. Suddenly, a voice from the void declared: *\"You are but vessels of small measure.\"* This is an ancient Chan saying.\n\n*\"The two words ‘purity’ and ‘stillness’\nAre like two cartloads of dung and dirt.\nThe physical body is inherently limited,\nWhile passions and desires surge without bound—\nFoolish as bees craving honey,\nMad as butterflies enamored of flowers.\"*\n\nMaster Danyang said: *\"When karmic roots run deep and heavy, and karma remains unexhausted, how can the Dao be attained?\"*\n\nThere are also those who practice the arts of the bedchamber, depleting the spirit, corrupting virtue, and misleading the masses. Their names are inscribed in the ledgers of ghosts, and their traces cast into Fengdu.\n\nThe scriptures say:\n*\"For long life, be most cautious in the bedchamber—\nWhy court death and make the spirits weep?\"*\nThose who indulge their passions and desires in this world may yet live in body, but their spirits already weep.\n\nIn Baisha Town of Zhongmou, there was a man named Zhao the Third. When asked about the Way of nurturing life, he replied: *\"The place that gives you life is the very place that destroys you.\"* This is the utmost truth.\n\nThe scriptures say: *\"If one can always remain pure and still, heaven and earth will all return to you.\"*\n\nDeepening stillness harmonizes the qi; harmonized qi makes the spirit flourish; a flourishing spirit is the foundation of immortal cultivation—once this foundation is established, the Dao arises.\n\nThis is inner work, yet it also relies on external nurturance. The Dao of immortals is real, while the way of mortals values mere splendor; the two stand in direct opposition. All evils must be renounced, all virtues cultivated. When the myriad practices are complete and the body wholly purified, one serves the Dao to life’s end without wavering or retreat. To embrace the Dao even in death is to remain unblemished in resolve.\n\nIn general, one must cultivate external blessings while inwardly consolidating the spirit. When both inner and outer work deepen, the ranks of immortality may be ascended, and the grotto-heavens explored. Those who have attained the Dao through the ages all rely on the mutual support of merit and wisdom—wisdom is the lamp, merit the oil. Without oil, the lamp does not shine; without merit, wisdom cannot flourish. Thus the enlightened would sooner harm their bodies than diminish their merit.\n\nThough some in this world possess keen intelligence and vast learning, if their merit remains unaccumulated, they will never fathom the subtleties of the Dao’s origin. The sages and worthies who have attained the Dao through the ages share a single path, yet their merit varies. Those whose external work is great ascend to loftier immortal ranks; those whose conduct is humble occupy lower stations.\n\nIn ancient times, celestial sages whose virtuous deeds were insufficient were often sent down to the human realm to repay past debts. The defiled and wicked find cultivation arduous yet progress swift; the pure and exalted of heaven dwell in ease, yet their progress is slow. The Yellow Emperor, long dwelling in heaven, was once demoted to the human realm for failing to enact great deeds. In his first life, he was a commoner; in his second, a minister; in his third, a sovereign. Only after aiding beings and benefiting life did he complete his merit and ascend as an immortal.\n\nEven the netherworld mirrors the human realm, where every inch of land and span of sky falls under governance. All who preside there were once people of merit in the world. During the early years of the Dading era, Li Yuantong, an official’s son from Longzhou, embraced poverty and delighted in the Dao. One day, he declared himself the Earth God of Wushan County. Similarly, Li Dehe of Pinglu County in Jiezhou formed a *Lingbao* assembly with others to perform rites for the deceased, accruing good merit. One night, he dreamed of a figure in blue descending from the sky, presenting a celestial decree that read: *\"Appointed Earth God of Zhongtiao Mountain.\"* Li replied, *\"I have devoted my life to the Dao—why am I granted only this minor post?\"* The immortal youth answered, *\"After three years, your term will end, and you will be promoted to a blessed-land immortal official.\"*\n\nIn Luoyang County of Longzhou, a man named Zhang Sanlang died and was reborn as a boy in the Qi family of Wushan County. As soon as he could speak, he recounted events from the Zhang household. When the Zhangs sought him out, he recognized all their elders without error. He even revealed the location of a hidden cache of silver, unknown to anyone. He further recounted his past lives: once a sparrow caught in a net; then a dog fond of licking bones, killed by a woman’s cleaver; next a sheep slaughtered by his eldest son for sacrifice; and now the Qi family’s child. Though the Qis were poor and the Zhangs wealthy, the Qis had once borrowed nine taels of silk from the Zhangs. Though repaid, the ledger remained unsettled—Zhang demanded repayment again, thus settling the karmic debt.\n\nLi Daoming, a Daoist from Cizhou, once lodged at a hermitage in Zhuhao Village, Yishui County. At the outset of his monastic life, he was destitute and unrestrained, drowning in wine. One night, he dreamed of being summoned to an official court, where several iron collars—holed but seamless—lay in the hall. A man knelt before them, and the magistrate ordered the attendants to collar him. They twisted his head until it fit through the hole, then pressed it into a perfect circle, making escape impossible. Li prostrated himself, weeping and protesting his innocence. The magistrate said, *\"You claim to cultivate the Dao, yet still indulge in lust and drink?\"* He was released, but upon exiting, he transformed into a kite, soaring over the sea. Gazing back in sorrow, he cried, *\"Why have I become this?\"* Exhausted by the vast expanse, he plummeted onto the water, startling awake in a cold sweat.\n\nThus, the transformations between human and other forms, or between spirit and matter, are not mere illusions but witnessed realities. The scriptures say: *\"A human body is hard to obtain; birth in the Middle Kingdom is rare. Even if born, encountering the true Dharma is difficult.\"* Having attained human form in China and met the true teaching, still only one or two in ten thousand turn toward it—how much rarer in barbarian lands where the Dao’s influence does not reach.\n\nThe *Recorded Sayings* of Perfected Hao the Ancient states:\n*\"Having left the household life, one must forget sorrow and sever cares, knowing contentment as true sufficiency. What use is hoarding two pints of grain a day? A single set of plain robes suffices for a year—what more is needed? One day of leisure is one day as an immortal. The Dao is empty yet desireless; the spirit settled, the qi harmonized. It is the root of creation, the reversal of yin and yang. The Dao is not far from man—man distances himself from the Dao. The sun and moon do not hasten—man hastens them. Be bold and resolute, yet humble in heart and yielding in intent. Wandering distant lands is not as good as sitting alone in devotion to the Dao. Roam freely yet dwell in tranquility. A belly full of delicacies is not as good as coarse rice to sate hunger. Wardrobes of fine silks are not as good as rough cloth to cover the body. Lavish feasts and revelry are not as good as transcendent stillness. Ascending towers in spring is not as good as serene simplicity. Ill-gotten wealth is not as good as poverty with inner joy. Eloquent debate is not as good as a day of silence. Discoursing on past and present is not as good as embracing the origin and guarding the One. Multifarious skills are not as good as abandoning learning to preserve simplicity. Harboring old grudges is not as good as purifying the heart and repenting past wrongs. When the Dao’s qi flows ceaselessly and practice bears fruit, one attains immortality. Forgetting words upon grasping meaning, moving in and out like a gentle stream, one returns to the wondrous root of the Great Void. Having caught the fish, forget the trap; tether the mind’s horse, subdue the heart’s monkey. Preserve simplicity, and all things come to fruition; guard the Dao, and a thousand blessings descend of themselves.\"*\n\nMoreover, it is said: In daily practice, cultivate qi in stillness and refine spirit in bustle; whether moving, staying, sitting, or lying—all is the Dao. From day to night, before your eyes, you must remain unwavering. If you sleep for an hour, you lose an hour; with daily effort and no sleep, a thousand days’ work is accomplished. Do not heed others’ words about innate predisposition.\n\nIt is further said: For those who cultivate the truth, if the heart is not subdued, even after years of leaving the household, there is no merit, for they have not seen their nature. Without seeing their nature, how can they nurture life? Without both nature and life complete, how can they become true? Why is this so? Because of the sickness of the heart.\n\nThe first sickness of the heart: seeing others who comprehend the principles of nature and life, one desires to learn but refuses to relinquish fame and profit, unwilling to humble oneself. Others will not teach, and resentment and slander arise.\n\nThe second sickness of the heart: seeing others with virtue, one does not reflect on one’s own lack but fails to transform others toward goodness, instead harboring malicious thoughts that harm the bonds of the Dao.\n\nThe third sickness of the heart: seeing others study scriptures, one, being ignorant, generates slanderous thoughts. Such people will never attain great wisdom or the celestial eye of the self-luminous pearl.\n\nThe fourth sickness of the heart: before one’s own practice has begun, one forcibly stirs up crowds, disturbing others—such a person is unworthy.\n\nThe fifth sickness of the heart: insatiable desire leads to mental chaos—such a person is never content.\n\nEliminate these five sicknesses, humble yourself, and seek instruction; you will surely attain the truth. If you cannot achieve great stillness, guard your fundamental duties. If you have not grasped the great principle, constantly study the scriptures and teachings. If you cannot move others, simply maintain stillness. Having gained even slight merit, do not forget nature and life.\n\nThose who can do this will advance in the Dao and swiftly become sages. Those who cannot will surely fall into the Dark Prison, lose their human form, grow fur and horns, and forever become beasts of the six paths. How then will the nine ancestors and seven generations ascend? It is because you have corrupted the Dao.\n\nThe words of the Seven Perfected and Five Patriarchs all expound the essentials of nature and life. Yet later learners often seek minor methods and deviant paths—some guide qi with the mind, some count breaths to forget the heart, some circulate water and fire in rapid exchange, some investigate the union of dragon and tiger. There are myriad approaches, impossible to record in full, causing the complete truth of the ancestral masters to fade into obscurity.\n\nOur Dao takes openness as its foundation, seeing nature as its essence, nurturing life as its function, humility and harmony as its virtue, modesty and retreat as its conduct, and guarding one’s duty as its merit. Through long accumulation, the celestial light shines within, and true qi surges and harmonizes. Form and spirit become wondrous, uniting with the Dao in truth.\n\nYet today’s learners are entangled in right and wrong, gain and loss, love and hate, greed and fear—these never leave the heart. With the heart in such a state, how can nature be settled? How can qi be harmonized? Naturally, it scatters, and one drifts ever farther from the Dao. Donning the crane-feather robe in vain, they defile the teachings.\n\nWhen they encounter the wise, they harbor a hundred resentments; when they meet the young or humble, they deceive in a hundred ways. Where there is slight profit, they seek every opening to exploit; when asked about the great Dao, they turn deaf and blind. Cunning and deceitful, flattering and reckless—they should never have left the household, yet they aspire to become immortals. Unwilling to subdue the heart, they indulge their present passions, becoming wicked disciples. Ignorant of scriptural meaning, they call a cow a horse; unaware of the Dao’s principles, they turn black into white.\n\nThe masters opened the gate of the teachings, hoping each would cultivate immortality. Yet now I observe my disciples—so many create karma, spreading deluded words and false teachings. Some claim to dream of spirit journeys, to gaze upon halls of cultivation, or to recall the names of their masters, leading a crowd of karmic women and a few pitiful men, babbling nonsense to deceive others. With eyes closed and lips sealed, they feign sincerity in the Dao, deluding the leaders of gatherings. Pretending wisdom, they offer forced interpretations, knowing only how to speak of right and wrong, unaware of sin and blessing, never considering the Dao. Indulging their stubborn hearts, they do no good. In the future, when the karmic retribution of the netherworld comes, who will bear the blame?\n\nDo not resent these bitter words as harsh truth—they are the good medicine of cultivation.\n\nTo enter our teaching, first cultivate the heart. When the heart does not wander outward, the spirit naturally settles, and qi naturally harmonizes. When qi and spirit harmonize, the Three Fields naturally coalesce. When the Three Fields coalesce, the magic mushroom naturally grows. To achieve completion, practice diligently and carefully.\n\nHidden virtue subdues ghosts; manifest virtue subdues people. With both virtues complete, the fruit of the Dao is established.\n\nThe former worthies—Perceptive Li the Immortal, Immortal Wang of Xianyang, Immortal Li of Longxi, Immortal Wang of Chengdu, Immortal Zhao of Xiangzhou, Immortal Ma of Tengzhou, and the Old Immortal of Xuzhou—along with many others, were all heroic figures. After entering the Dao, they humbled their hearts and minds, endured hardship with steadfast resolve, revered their teachers as gods, and respected their companions as guests. Their mouths uttered no frivolous words, and their bodies performed no flattering deeds. For twenty or thirty years, they guarded their teachers’ teachings, ultimately attaining enlightenment and shedding their forms to ascend as immortals, becoming the eyes and pillars of the teaching. How magnificent!\n\nYet today’s learners do not honor their teachers or respect their companions. When they see the worthy, they harbor resentment; when they see the foolish, they mock and jest. They do not learn good deeds but only foster competitive pride. Such people, in life, are demonic forces within the teaching; in death, they become seeds of hell.\n\nIf they grow two horns—sometimes there, sometimes not—a single cultivated tail will surely fix them forever. The nine ancestors and seven generations will all suffer in torment: the icy pools with their freezing agony, the boiling cauldrons with their burning anguish, the sword trees and knife mountains, dying and reviving a thousand times. Do not wait until then to regret.\n\n*True Immortals’ Direct Pointers, Volume One* concludes.\n\n*True Immortals’ Direct Pointers*\nScripture Title: *True Immortals’ Direct Pointers*. Dictated by Jin Ma Yu et al., compiled by Xuanquanzi. Two fascicles.\n\n**True Immortals’ Direct Pointers, Volume Two**\n*Compiled by Xuanquanzi, the Autumn Moon Daoist of the Sea and Sky*\n\nThe Pure Harmony Perfected One’s Teachings [Recorded]:\n\nThose who leave the household must examine their calculating minds, tallying each day’s wicked thoughts. Not only are wine, lust, wealth, and temper desires of the heart—whatever one loves becomes a craving. If you can turn away from even a single thing, the mind’s terrain becomes easier to subdue, and peace comes gradually.\n\nPeople say attaining the Dao is difficult, yet if cultivators turn their minds around, making them as clear as ice, practice becomes effortless. Free from the smoke and fire of strife, free from judgments of right and wrong or self and other, merit and conduct swiftly take form.\n\nThose who speak of *youwei* (deliberate action) labor within the teaching. Those who speak of *wuwei* (non-action) sever all entanglements. With not a single thing remaining, applying effort to the mind at every moment—this is when the sages and worthies lend their aid. If one lacks merit and conduct, the sages and worthies will not intervene.\n\nThe sages teach: abide in stillness, yet dare not remain unmoving; abide in motion, yet cannot rest in quietude. If one disregards the path ahead, drifting through days in idle abandon, even a moment’s respite is lost. Every needle and blade of grass lies within the sages’ domain.\n\nFor those who refine the mind, there are natural garments and natural sustenance—no need for painful seeking, for the sages subtly orchestrate all. Since you are a cultivator, apply effort in earnest, and the sages will not lead you astray.\n\nIt is also said: where there are names and forms, there is movement and stillness; where there is seeing and hearing, there is fortune and misfortune. When a blade presses against the neck without fear or alarm, when the mind remains unmoved—this is the courage of a sage. If affliction arises, treat it as death. If joy or sorrow comes, know it as an old karmic debt from past lives, and repay it.\n\nIt is also said: since ancient times, sages have all emerged from poverty and hardship, never from wealth and nobility. Those who are poor and humble find it easier to humble the mind and refine demons in Daoist practice. The wealthy and noble, however, are beset by lust and arrogance, and even ten thousand taels of gold are easily squandered. If the mind remains unmoved, free from greed and attachment, free from clinging to emptiness, then nothing can be lost.\n\nIn success, people listen to the wind; in failure, they wail in distress. If one can treat both with equanimity, they have mastered the mind’s terrain.\n\nIt is also said: When Master Yuyang presided over the teaching, he imparted an oral formula: *\"Cultivate the myriad practices as the true oral formula; gather spirit and qi to strike the Three Passes.\"* By the time the Ever-Spring Perfected One took leadership, the teaching had changed. Those who seek to transmit the Dao need only accumulate hidden virtue outwardly and inwardly fortify their essence and spirit—what more is there to say?\n\nIt is also said: Wherever cultivators walk, they attain the Dao; whether sitting or standing, they attain the Dao. To accumulate blessings, simply harbor good intentions, and blessings will naturally grow, leading the Dao to respond. Offering alms to others accords with the Dao; contending for merit and blessings, enduring hardship—all accord with the Dao. Putting others first, suffering for their benefit, distancing oneself from emotions and desires—all accord with the Dao. Simply maintaining a good heart accords with the Dao. Yet people refuse to comply; at the slightest encounter with circumstances, they are deluded—how can the Dao respond?\n\nIt is also said: Master Danyang once declared: *\"Slaughtering a hundred oxen is not as grave as killing one person; harming a hundred people is not as grievous as misleading a single cultivator.\"*\n\nIt is also said: Everyone wants me to speak of the profound and wondrous, yet the profound and wondrous cannot be spoken—one must awaken to it oneself. Even if spoken, without practice, it is of no use. Cultivators do not attain the Dao in a single lifetime; those who do have accumulated merit in past lives. Cultivators need only follow the teachings and direct words of their masters, and their practice will not err. Sweeping the dust is merit; attending to others is merit; subduing the mind is merit; eliminating emotions and desires, reading scriptures—all are merit. Whatever is done for benefit is merit and conduct. If merit and conduct are not perfected in this life, the sages will guide one in future lives.\n\nMaster Danyang and the Patriarch were companions for three lifetimes and cultivators for ten. Yet whenever they emerged, they awakened to the true teaching. Only through accumulating merit and conduct over many lives can one achieve realization in this life. The same holds for other masters.\n\nIt is also said: In all that cultivators do, they must wholeheartedly accept and comply—this is merit and conduct. Though they may not perceive it, the sages accumulate it in secret. Whatever beneficial actions they undertake will yield merit and conduct, which will ultimately return to them. Without discernment, merit naturally accrues. If one does not accept this, how can merit arise?\n\nIf cultivators harbor deluded intentions in seeking practice, their efforts will be in vain. All is attained without intention. Simply harboring good intentions in beneficial actions yields merit and conduct, though the sages’ unseen workings remain invisible.\n\nFor example, in mundane labor, one must constantly embody the Dao. Do not act blindly—then merit will arise. If one quarrels over a bowl, then over a chopstick, then over who rises first, igniting anger and provoking disputes, how can merit arise? If cultivators suffer for others’ benefit, offering good things for others to use while taking the bad for themselves, taking on hardship, burdens, and difficulties first—this yields the greatest merit and reveals a heart attuned to the Dao.\n\nPeople say they wish to transmit the Dao, yet the Dao cannot be transmitted. To speak of transmitting it is to be a heretic; to seek it is to be a heretic.\n\nIt is also said: Among all things, humans are the most intelligent and noble, yet they undergo countless births and deaths. Like the eye observing objects, without a true master, the nature clings to phenomena, and the mind arises from phenomena—this is called *birth*.\n\nAgain, the ear hears sound, yet the nature chases after it—arising in sound, vanishing in the object. The nose smells fragrance, and the nature clings to the scent—arising in fragrance, vanishing in sound. The tongue tastes flavor, and the nature attaches to sweetness—arising in flavor, vanishing in fragrance. The body delights in fine clothing, arising in garments, vanishing in sweetness. The mind indulges in thought, arising in contemplation, vanishing in garments. Wherever a single念 arises, there is birth; wherever a single念 ceases, there is extinction. Throughout the twelve hours of the day, without cultivation, the human heart teems with a thousand threads and ten thousand strands, tangled and striking the mind—this is the thousand births and ten thousand deaths.\n\nTo sever birth and extinction, first raise a single念 and employ awareness to illuminate it, seeing through the emptiness of all conditions. Only then can external phenomena fail to stain. With long practice, even awareness is forgotten, and the mind becomes naturally still. Stillness gives rise to non-action, and non-action naturally aligns with the Great Dao.\n\nIt is also said: The Master, Perpetual Spring Realized One, endured hardship to temper demons, fearing his merit was insufficient. On the mountain, he carried stones back and forth to train against sleep. Yet his blessings were meager, and his mind unsettled—later, he faced two deadly demonic trials. The first time, he barely escaped death; the second, a flying stone shattered three ribs, nearly killing him. Thereafter, illness and demons assailed him repeatedly, breaking his arms three times. Yet unmoved by such obstacles, he intensified his resolve.\n\nFor cultivators, the stronger the aspiration, the greater the demons; without aspiration, there are no demons. Each trial endured adds a layer of blessing. Each demon passed brightens the mind and sharpens the nature.\n\nIt is further said: In Shandong, there was a Master Zhang who sat in meditation for years. During his practice, a stalk of hemp fell before him—he glanced at it once, then twice, yet refused to look again. One day, a man descended from the ceiling beams, exhaled deeply, and stood before him. Zhang suspected this was a \"body outside the body\" and left his meditation to seek the Perpetual Spring Master, questioning his doubts. After bowing, he knelt and began describing the visions from his meditation. The Master already knew and said: \"For cultivators in practice, nothing seen with the eyes should be acknowledged. Seeing the Master is not real, nor is seeing the Buddha, gods, ghosts, people, dragons, tigers, celestial stars, or earthly beasts. None of it is real.\"\n\nZhang still harbored doubts, believing it was a \"body outside the body.\" He asked again, and the Perpetual Life Master replied: \"The teachings of Master Qiu are clear—if a cultivator encounters visions, attachment to them is heresy. Amid all phenomena, remain unstained and unattached. When merit is sufficient, the Dao will respond naturally. Release your doubts.\" Zhang bowed in gratitude.\n\nIt is also said: Every monastic aspires to seek the profound and wondrous, yet none act daily. To temper the mind against demons with sincerity and simplicity is the true wonder. To awaken the moment a念 arises, to know each念 as it turns—this is the wonder of no念 arising. To not love what others love is wonder; to not hear what others hear is wonder; to not speak of the rise and fall of past and present is wonder; to refrain from gossip is wonder; to avoid contention is wonder; to forsake fame and profit is wonder; to suffer for others’ benefit is wonder; to abstain from wine, lust, wealth, and anger is wonder; to forget sorrow and anxiety is wonder; to not speak in vulgar terms is wonder; to extinguish attachment and longing is wonder; to forever sever anger is wonder; to cut off frivolous chatter is wonder. For all past attachments, to turn away and not transgress is wonder.\n\nTo embody this wonder is to be subtly profound and spiritually penetrating, to be one who has attained the mysterious and mastered the wondrous, able to traverse heaven and earth, moving sages and worthies. With harmonious spirit and qi, one becomes a person who has realized the Dao—what more is there? If you grasp this profundity, why seek further? Yet people claim there is more, desiring to become immortals. If so, why did these masters of old, receiving only the profound teachings from the patriarchs, endure countless hardships, tempering the mind against demons and accumulating twelve years of merit? True cultivation demands genuine practice to achieve perfection.\n\nIt is also said: Monastics must advance without doubt, for doubt hinders progress. Some, after five or ten years of practice—having meditated, stood for causes, received guests, begged for alms, trained against sleep, lived in mountains, and done all such deeds—see no results and grow disheartened, asking, \"How is this different from the secular?\" This is doubt, and how can one advance? Though no signs appear, press forward with unwavering resolve. Until life’s end, devote heart and soul, forging blessings where conditions align. Never indulge body or mind; silently accumulate merit and virtue, and sages will uplift you.\n\nIt is further said: The Three Poisons are human greed, hatred, and delusion, all arising from desire. The Three Desires are craving for food, sleep, and sensuality. When these desires deepen, the Six Thieves invade. The scriptures say: \"The nine orifices’ depravity lies in the Three Essentials.\"\n\nTurning back to trade bones—all is the work of the Three Corpses and Six Thieves. As one who walks the Dao, you must reverse the Three Desires. Once the Three Desires are turned back, the Six Thieves and Three Corpses are easily subdued. Without resolute strength, one cannot sever them; you must exert force to eradicate them.\n\nIt is further said: All conditioned practices—circulating qi, discussing methods—are but tricks and stratagems. Whatever you have learned can be discarded, save for the scriptures, which cannot be abandoned. The scriptures are but a lamp to illuminate the path, for when the mind is yet unenlightened, heaven and earth are dark, and one cannot walk at night without a light. When heaven and earth are bright, the eye sees straight ahead. *Jing* (scriptures) means \"path\"—they open the way for others. Once the mind-ground is awakened, even the scriptures are no longer needed. To cling to them is also wrong, nor should one attach to any trivial matters within the teachings. Where there is attachment, the Dao cannot be attained.\n\nNowadays, those who cultivate the Dao are plagued by doubt. Setting a narrow resolve breeds narrow doubt, and this is due to meager blessings. If one’s resolve is insufficient to attain the Dao, it is no different from having no resolve at all—both endure suffering in vain. Yet those with resolve, though they suffer, have a beginning and an end, and may awaken again. Those without resolve have no beginning or end and cannot return.\n\nPeople seek the profound and wondrous but do not exhaustively investigate how to enter its origin and end—how to penetrate it. One must endure hardship for others, humble oneself, and cultivate softness and weakness gradually.\n\nIt is further said: A monastic who supports ten or twenty people may find leisure and comfort for themselves. But one who cannot support others will struggle even to digest their own food. If you do not seek even half a spoonful in times of difficulty but instead feast where success is easily won, and if you do not humble your heart, gathering in crowds like drifting tumbleweeds, idly passing days, it will be of no avail—such leisure is hard to repay.\n\nNo one in the world dares to be idle; one must labor day and night to sustain life. To wander idly while accepting others’ offerings is no small matter.\n\nIt is further said: The Daoist’s mind should be impartial, free from favoritism, attachment, honor or disgrace, or emotional desires. To follow them brings joy; to resist them brings anger. When you reach the state of no-mind, you must still have mastery. Without a master, you may unknowingly slip into another’s shell.\n\nAll wish to attain the Dao, but test yourself in the twelve hours of the day—each hour has eight quarters—is your mind ever settled? Do not deceive your heart in your actions. To act without deceit is to be a person of the Dao.\n\nThe Great Dao is easy to know but hard to practice. Though it can be spoken of in a moment, you must cultivate it in the mind-ground and wholly abandon worldly affairs. Even mendicants who appear free of care often gossip and debate right and wrong. Reading scriptures, they discuss false detachment, yet sages do not protect them. When a single境界 arises, they are quickly overwhelmed, falling into madness or illness, and many die—all for lack of blessings. If you rise to greet guests and serve the teachings with effort, accumulating abundant blessings, sages will uplift you.\n\nIt is further said: In ancient times, masters attained the Dao at different times. Master Ma gained it midway, Master Tan midway, and Master Liu in a brothel. People say that attaining the Dao pierces heaven and earth, yet there are places it does not reach, for merits and practices differ, each with its own stages. Ascending one heaven reveals what others cannot see, and sages will uplift you.\n\nIt is further said: Today, Daoists dwell in fine temples, guide disciples, and accept offerings. To say one has blessings is impure, for blessings are finite, but a clear mind and tranquil intent endure. A moment of true leisure is boundless blessing. Enduring worldly toil is great merit; humbling the heart is great merit—yet one must not mistake toil for virtue. When daily toil is done, seek a quiet place to sit and cultivate the mind. Though it may not seem effective at first, over time, the mind will gradually find peace.\n\nYet who now humbles their heart? All act with reckless abandon. When others slander, strike, or curse you, it is but a gift of blessings. When people praise and flatter you, it is but a demand for blessings.\n\nThe scriptures say: Knowing emptiness as not-empty, knowing form as not-form—this is called illumination. It is the yang aspect. When the mind is settled, whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, all is practicing the Dao. With a settled mind, both action and inaction are right; with an unsettled mind, neither action nor inaction is right.\n\nIt is further said: The *Qingjing Jing* (Scripture of Clarity and Stillness) is the essential wonder of cultivation. If interpreted through form, one cannot enter; if through conditioned action, one also cannot enter. Only by seeking the formless can one enter. Where words fail, there lies the Great Dao—this is the highest vehicle. No-mind is the first step. If you struggle against the mind, expending effort, using methods to control it, this is conditioned practice. To govern the state and the body with the Dao is the unconditioned Way.\n\nIt is further said: The cultivator who does not indulge in fine food, who does not flare with anger or ignite passion, accumulates blessings. To crave fine food, to flare with anger, to argue right and wrong, to stir others’ hearts—this dissipates blessings. If you spend all your money and possessions, and others admire you for it, it increases your own blessings. Abundant blessings bring peace and harmony.\n\nAmong the Three Desires—food, sleep, and sensuality—food is the root. Eating to fullness breeds drowsiness and stirs lustful thoughts. Eat only two or three parts of a meal, and the qi will naturally flow smoothly.\n\nWhen I resided in Dongzhou, I had three hundred young disciples, but after encountering official persecution, only three remained. Nowadays, among the young, many remain steadfast in their resolve—these are the blessed ones.\n\nIt is further stated in the scriptures: The mind is the root, and phenomena are dust; the two are like marks upon a mirror. Only when the dust and grime are fully cleansed does the light appear; when mind and dharma awaken to each other, one becomes a true person.\n\nIt is said that sitting is the Dao, yet if the body sits while the mind is turned by external things—like dust stirred by labor—it is far inferior to a settled mind. In walking, standing, sitting, or lying, the Dao is present everywhere. The key is to keep the mind unmoved.\n\nPeople are like a ladle: two ears, one handle, used as needed. If one day it breaks, it is melted back into molten gold, and the craftsman molds it into a new vessel. How then can it claim, \"I am still the ladle\"? If one day your vision falls to the earth, hoping to regain a human form in the next life, it is difficult. If the mind is not subdued, even a day of fasting cannot dissolve the karma. But if the mind is pure, the heart still, and unmoved, the offerings of all under heaven can be received and dissolved.\n\nIt is also said: Master Changchun once observed that several fellow masters surpassed him in blessings, wisdom, and appearance. He then resolved to cultivate his mind for three years, aiming to refine it like cold ashes. After ten years, he found his mind even harder to discipline. Knowing his blessings were meager, he redoubled his resolve, donning a pair of hemp sandals, tying and untying them, walking back and forth seventeen or eighteen times each night to prevent his nature from growing dull. Later, after fifty days of practice, his mind remained unmoved, his true heart ever luminous, like a crystal pagoda. Yet if even a single thought arose, he would weep, knowing his blessings were insufficient.\n\nLater, the military governor of Chang’an invited him to a feast. That night, he was lost in thought three times. Knowing his blessings were too small to attain the Dao, he endured the trials of heavenly demons and the Five Great Demons of the Five Directions, who hurled stones to break three of his ribs—yet his mind remained unmoved. Later, a sage informed him, \"On the fifteenth day of the second month, you will attain the Dao.\" By the eleventh day, his vision pierced heaven and earth, and he saw mountains and rivers as if in the palm of his hand.\n\nI once calculated that in the twelve hours of a day, I first kept my mind from dullness for eight hours, then nine. The remaining two hours were difficult to master, and I dared not relax, lest I grow slightly dull. Living thus, after seven or eight days, I no longer closed my eyes, eating only two or three parts of a meal. Though I refined sleep, I also refined the mind—without refining the mind, it would be of no use.\n\nMaster Ma said: \"Let the spirit elixir flow freely for a moment, and the jade nature withers with the slightest indulgence.\"\n\nIt is further said: Master Ma spoke of four ranks of immortals—ghost immortals, human immortals, earth immortals, and spirit immortals—all possessing karmic affinities from past lives. After departing, they may dwell on the Ten Continents and Three Islands, or in the grotto-heavens of famous mountains, their abodes arranged according to their merit and conduct. Those with great merit ascend as celestial officials; those with lesser merit may return to the human world after five or six hundred, or two or three thousand years, to accumulate further merit and practice. Even without merit or practice, if one remains single-minded in purity, there will still be a place of return in the end.\n\nActs of almsgiving, offerings, and merit-making through good deeds are conditioned virtues, leading only to the fruits of human or heavenly realms, yet still subject to the cycle of rebirth.\n\nIt is also said: Some cultivators claim there is no karma of good or evil. Only by not giving rise to worldly thoughts in any of the twelve hours can one be free of karma. If one engages in even the slightest action, merit cannot accumulate. If even a grain of dust-like thought arises in the mind, it must be swiftly cut away. When the mind is unmoved, the spirit settles; when the spirit settles, the qi harmonizes.\n\nAfter three years without leakage, the lower elixir forms; after six years, the middle elixir forms. After nine years, the great elixir forms—yet without blessings, one cannot succeed.\n\nA true person once said: When I was at home, I observed the ways of people in the world. Cultivators have a great taboo: seeing others’ faults and speaking of them harms oneself. All things under heaven are fated; one must let go of everything. Some err by excess, others by deficiency. The clever often overreach and must be restrained; the simple often cling and must be guided. In all merit and practice, the most stable path is steadfast sitting.\n\nIn the past, Master Zuo Huan sat as if imprisoned, never daring to relax for even a moment. If others spoke, he refrained from speaking; if others engaged in right and wrong, he remained free of it.\n\nOthers observe appearances—you must not observe appearances. Break through everything entirely; this is the supreme move of the highest vehicle. Even feigning indifference surpasses having intent. Studying the Dao through false elimination, cultivating truth through empty refinement—all return to the same source, like the bright moon and the clear wind.\n\nIt is also said: One who has grown weary of worldly affairs speaks little; when questioned by all, he merely nods. If he were to cease nodding altogether, there would be no afflictions, no sorrows.\n\nAgain, it is said: The master silently recites scriptures, not blowing on the fire for fear of harming his spirit. In seeking the sacred, he avoids the southwest’s lowly position; when sitting, he chooses the lower, more accessible place—all is as it should be. Yet the slightest touch may ignite anger, and though his outbursts do not deplete his spirit and qi, the practitioner must not neglect his parents nor serve the state—such a one is useless, consuming the world’s resources in vain. If he wears coarse robes and begs for scraps, eating what others discard, he will not attain the Dao, nor will he incur karmic debt. But if he accepts offerings and fails to realize the Dao, he must repay the debt of those gifts, like a man whose strength is spent and can walk no further. To aid others is a single act of merit, yet he must remain unmoved in heart. After three years of guarding the Dao, even sages and worthies will take notice.\n\nThe practitioner who is without attachment passes his days with ease, and all his merits and deeds accrue. People in stillness long for bustle, while those in bustle long for stillness. In those days, I spoke not a word all day, and others called me proud. But those who seek wealth and honor, who contend for fame and profit—*they* are the truly proud. I, who spoke not a word yet guarded the Dao, whose heart was pure and still, was like Boyi, Shuqi, Xu You, or Chaofu—even without merit or deeds, it was well. I maintained a single resolve in poverty, for the great matter of the teaching.\n\nThe practitioner who subdues sleep must first settle the mind upon things, willing to rest, and further, not be attached to affairs. With modest meals and a light heart, sleep naturally diminishes, and endurance comes easily. Even if some drowsiness lingers, it is no hindrance. But if one clings to every thing, craving fine food and refusing plain fare, attributing sleep to this or that circumstance, then sitting in meditation will be of little use. If wakefulness is one’s resolve, progress lies ahead.\n\nYet there are those who say, “What are you sitting for? This is mere affectation.” They cannot advance because they lack the heart for the Dao. The ancients said:\n*Birds die for their bright plumage,\nTurtles perish for their sacred shells.\nBetter to be a useless thing,\nAnd live in peace through all one’s days.*\n\nAgain, it is said: When an infant is first born, it receives a single spark of numinous light—free from sin or merit, joy or anger, favor or disgrace, right or wrong. But those who came before teach it to vie for superiority, to judge between self and others, and so the light is obscured. The awakened one casts off passions and desires, returns to simplicity, and single-mindedly guards the true qi and numinous light. Though without merit or deeds, they come and go as a spirit of luminous clarity.\n\nIt is said: Cultivating one’s nature is easily accomplished—cultivate much, and the merit is great; cultivate little, and the merit is small. What is cultivation? Simply to keep the heart unmoved. The practitioner who recognizes the heart and sees the nature passes the days with ease; one who does not suffers daily torment. What else does the practitioner discuss if not the ground of the heart? The highest capacity is to act without waiting for others to awaken.\n\nThe sages and worthies, out of compassion, fearing others will follow blindly, teach diligence, hospitality, and service—sacrificing oneself to benefit others, humbling and yielding, never letting a day pass in vain. Accumulating virtue and merit, when merit is vast, the heart naturally finds peace. Master Danyang, out of compassion, directly pointed to the work of the heart, wholly abandoning worldly affairs. *This is the way of the highest capacity.*\n\nAll practitioners begin with resolve, but after ten years, they grow lax, seeking here and there, finding nothing. Seeking in emptiness, they find nothing. Simply pacify the heart from beginning to end—what more is there to seek?\n\nGenerally, the nature resides in the feet, yet whether above or below, one sees neither what is before nor behind. The single nature pervades the ten directions, observed as one body. If attachments arise, all becomes limited; one must remain vividly alive. After three years without leakage, the lower elixir congeals, and the eyes gain radiance. After six years without leakage, the middle elixir congeals, and the yang spirit emerges. After nine years without leakage, the great elixir congeals, and one soars freely. All this arises from stillness and extinction, where the nature follows eating and drinking, and the six spiritual functions are empty yet not empty.\n\nIt is said:\n*To recklessly deny cause and effect is to court disaster,\nTo abandon being and cling to non-being is like fleeing drowning only to leap into fire.*\n\nWhen engaging in worldly labor, one must first settle daily sustenance. If one does not engage in worldly labor yet fails to pacify the heart, one incurs a debt of the mouth. If the mind remains unmoved, one cultivates the heart and refines the nature, quietly accumulating merit—humility and yielding are likewise essential.\n\nIf one engages in worldly labor with the heart set on merit, offering meals as alms, seeking the Dao, and seeing others make offerings brings joy, while seeing others take one’s own wealth brings vexation. This is the daily refinement of the nature. The illusory body does not belong to oneself—only the single spark of true nature is one’s own. Whether walking or sitting, one nurtures the Dao.\n\nThe Buddhist scriptures say:\n*The six spiritual functions are empty yet not empty,\nA single orb of radiance is form yet not form.*\n\nPeople lose their spirit through the six senses’ delusion. The six senses are: the eyes do not recklessly gaze, the ears do not recklessly listen, the nose does not recklessly smell fragrance or stench, the tongue does not recklessly crave flavors, the body does not recklessly seek softness, and the mind does not recklessly wander in thought. With the heart unmoved, one guards against harm to the true nature in every thing. People lose their spirit through the six senses, unable to hold fast. If not lost, the spirit gathers; when the spirit gathers, qi gathers; when qi gathers, life is preserved, and the great elixir is accomplished.\n\nThe idle heart of an idle person is best—firm in the Dao, single-minded in worldly labor, wholehearted in the same way; single-minded in alms-giving, wholehearted likewise; single-minded as a Daoist, wholehearted likewise. Yet because the heart has a thousand differences, one serves others. If the heart is good, there is merit—storing grain to feed travelers, growing vegetables for travelers to eat, planting trees to shade travelers—this is merit. Yet nothing is as difficult as single-mindedly nurturing the Dao. Serving others is also good.\n\nLong ago in the capital, there was a gardener named Chen. He could not speak of mysteries, nor read scriptures, nor recite private teachings. Yet his master once took him to heaven. *True Immortal’s Direct Pointers, Volume Two, concludes.*",

Two fascicles.*\n*Source text: Zhengtong Daoist Canon, Orthodox Section, Part One.*\n\n---\n\n**True Immortals’ Direct Pointers: Recorded Sayings, Fascicle One**\n*Compiled by Xuanquanzi, the Daoist of Autumn Moon over Sea and Sky*\n\n**Recorded Sayings of the Perfected Immortal Ma of Danyang**\n\nAt the Chongyang Assembly on Dragon Gate Mountain, the Master of Danyang addressed the assembly, saying:\n\nIn daily life, one must not deceive the three powers of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity. Always act with reverent care, for even an inch of time is precious—do not squander it.\n\nSleep is a human desire, yet it must be moderated. Do not devote yourself solely to seated meditation; in movement, stillness, sitting, and standing, so long as the mind is settled, all is the Dao.\n\nGentlemen, do not stir the mind or rouse thoughts. Swiftly seek your nature and life, but if you can only calm the mind and dispel desires, you are already an immortal.\n\nDo not harbor doubts—these are true and authentic words. Only constant purity and stillness are difficult to practice. Yet once you awaken to the emptiness of the myriad phenomena, the mind clarifies itself, desires dispel themselves, nature stabilizes itself, life abides itself, the elixir coalesces itself, and immortality is achieved itself. No one else can do this for you.\n\nEach of you must apply effort without haste, ever at ease and free. Had my master not revealed this, I would not have dared to recognize it as the wondrous method. Now that I have attained its efficacy, I transmit it to others.\n\nGentlemen, simply set aside doubt and abide in the principle of non-action, purity, and spontaneity. Do not stir the fires of passion, and you will have attained the Dao.\n\nHe further said:\n\nThe celestial Dao revolves ceaselessly through the twelve hours, driving the transformations of creation—does it ever rest? Those who practice the Dao must emulate the celestial Dao, never pausing for even a moment in the twelve hours, but revolving the transformations within their own bodies. They must remain perpetually pure and still, without the slightest dust of thought—this is cultivation. If you practice thus, you will become an immortal in days. But if you falter in effort or conduct, how can you attain liberation?\n\nI observe that among you, not one maintains single-minded devotion to the Dao for even a single hour. How then can you become immortals? Having received offerings from the ten directions, how will you repay them? When your eyes close in death, you will fall into the Dark Realm, suffering for kalpas without end. I now urge you: let me tell you what the Dao is.\n\nSimply calm the mind and dispel desires, leaving no thread of the myriad phenomena entangled. When spirit and qi harmonize and ascend, this is the Dao. Follow this practice, and you will not err.\n\nIf you fail to practice thus, do not blame the patriarchs or perfected masters. Do you not recall how the Seven Ancestors, in their lifetimes, created boundless karma and endured limitless suffering, hoping their descendants would attain the Dao, relying on Heaven’s mercy to deliver them to rebirth in the celestial realms?\n\nI bow to my disciples beneath this gate: from this day forward, do not waste time. Endure without retreat, embrace the Dao and return—this is my vow.\n\nHe further said:\n\nDiminish flavors to nourish qi,\nDiscard anger to nurture nature,\nEndure humiliation and lowliness to cultivate virtue,\nGuard purity and stillness to cultivate the Dao.\nLet your name not be bound to registers,\nLet your heart not dwell in the world—\nThis is how one sheds the mortal shell and becomes a companion of Heaven.\n\nHe further said:\n\nDevoting oneself wholly to the Dao, anyone may attain it. Immortals differ from worldly people in that their progress is not subject to rise and fall. Yet non-action and purity are the highest and most effortless vehicle.\n\nHe further said:\n\nThe subtlety of the Daoist lies in nothing more than nurturing qi. People drowned in profit and fame often dissipate their qi. For those who study the Dao, there is no other task but to attain utmost purity and stillness, to preserve spirit and nurture qi.\n\nWhen the heart’s fluid descends and kidney qi ascends to the spleen, thoughts cease, spirit becomes numinous, the elixir coalesces, and immortality is achieved. If one cannot carry Mount Tai under the arm and leap over the Northern Sea, it is not the Dao.\n\nHe further said:\n\nThe Dao is simply purity, stillness, non-action, and freedom—untainted and unattached. If you can practice this thoroughly in the twelve hours, you will not be led astray.\n\nHe further said:\n\nQi is difficult to stabilize, swift as a galloping horse. Only stillness can govern it. First, abandon external distractions. Even amidst crowds, remain as if in a deep mountain valley—this is the mark of a Daoist. Without reaching the state of no-mind, it is difficult to control.\n\nHe further said:\n\nGuard purity and tranquility to nurture the Dao;\nEndure humiliation and lowliness to cultivate virtue;\nDiscard anger and extinguish ignorance to nurture nature;\nModerate diet and diminish flavors to nurture qi.\nThen, when nature is settled, emotions fade;\nWhen form is empty, qi circulates;\nWhen the heart dies, spirit lives;\nWhen yang flourishes, yin wanes—\nThis is the natural principle.\n\nHe further said:\n\nIn the Dao, whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying, one must not depart from it for even a moment.\nIn walking, place your feet on level ground;\nIn standing, concentrate spirit in the Great Void;\nIn sitting, regulate breath to be soft and continuous;\nIn lying, sink spirit into the secluded valley.\nWith long practice and no interruption, you will seem dull-witted all day.\n\nHe further said:\n\nEach day, ensure that in every matter, there is nothing to attend to. Release the myriad threads, close the six gates to prevent entry. Speak little, cling to nothing. In the twelve hours, remain ever unwavering. Reduce sleep, set everything aside.\n\nThough there are six gates, there is but one master. When nothing remains, this is restoration.\n\nHe further said:\n\nFor beginners entering the Dao, from this day forward, let worldly affairs no longer occupy the mind. Devote yourself wholeheartedly, steadfast to the end—never abandon the path midway. If even the slightest trace remains unremoved, the Dao will not be firm.\n\nDo not dwell on past events, nor anticipate the future. Simply attend to the present moment—this is a person without cares. Those entangled in affection for children and family, with little resolve for the Dao’s radiance, are not true Dao-seekers.\n\nHe further said:\n\nListen to my words: do not forget the inner and outer applications of daily life.",

      "translated_text": "The outer daily practice forbids seeing others’ faults, boasting of one’s own virtue, disparaging the worthy, envying the capable, stirring worldly thoughts, or harboring desires—all such transgressions. The inner daily practice is true purity and true stillness, unstained and unattached, regulating qi and nurturing spirit, carefree and at ease, silently accumulating merit and conduct, seeking no recognition from others, only hoping for Heaven’s witness.\n\nA poem says:\nThe great Dao stands far from worldly passions,\nNon-doing is the wondrous foundation.\nIn the world, love no things,\nAnd vexations will not follow.\n\nHe further said: As for purity and stillness—purity means purifying the heart-source, stillness means quieting the sea of qi. When the heart-source is pure, external things cannot disturb it, and nature settles into spirit-brightness. When the sea of qi is still, wayward desires cannot arise, essence is preserved, and the abdomen is full. Thus, to clarify the heart is like clarifying water—all things reflect themselves. To nurture qi is like protecting an infant—allow no harm. When qi penetrates, spirit becomes numinous; when spirit is numinous, qi transforms—this is the attainment of purity and stillness.\n\nHe further said: As for non-doing—one must not indulge in thoughts of love, caution, profit, or harm. In this way, though one acts, one remains ever non-doing; though one engages in affairs, one remains ever without affairs. How much more so when one single-mindedly purifies the heart and stills the intent, nurtures qi and preserves spirit, drifting lightly through the realm of carefree wandering, arriving at the land of nothing-whatsoever.\n\nHe further said: If one practices with a mind and with doing, it is all mere technique. If one practices without mind and without doing, it is boundless clarity and emptiness.\n\nHe further said: Wine is the brew that disorders nature; meat is the substance that severs life. One must abstain entirely—this is best. Violations of wine and meat may yet be forgiven, but violations of lust are crimes beyond pardon. The harm of lust’s vessel is more severe than wolves and tigers: it ruins fine conduct, damages good deeds, depletes essence, extinguishes spirit, and even harms the body—thus it is the great sin of Dao-seekers.\n\nHe further said: The great Dao takes non-mind as its essence, forgetting words as its function, softness and weakness as its root, purity and stillness as its foundation. Applied to body and mind, it means moderating diet, cutting off thoughts, sitting in stillness to regulate breath, and resting tranquilly to nurture qi. When the heart does not wander, nature is settled; when the body is not wearied, essence is preserved; when spirit is not disturbed, the elixir coalesces. Then, extinguishing passions in emptiness and calming spirit to the utmost, one may be said to attain the wondrous Dao without leaving one’s door. Since ancient times, immortals have never dared to leap past the two words “clarity and stillness”—these are profound words indeed. The scripture says: Clarify the heart, and spirit will naturally become clear. Many practitioners speak of clarifying the heart but do not understand the principle of clarifying the heart. What is the principle of clarifying the heart? It is simply that not a single thought arises, the nature-body is truly empty, utterly serene and still, like the sky’s clarity without distinction—this is true heart-clarification. When no heart remains to be clarified, this is called clarifying the heart.\n\nMoreover, the numinous source and wondrous awareness are originally pure and still, but because the ten thousand dusts pollute the still water, when dust is abundant, the water becomes turbid, and when thoughts are many, nature darkens. Thus, clarifying the heart and reducing affairs, the water becomes clear of itself, and nature becomes bright of itself. When the light of clarity is shallow, movement stirs dust; when the light of clarity is deep, even if wind and waves surge, the water does not muddy. This is like the measure of a person’s skill. In learning the Dao, one does not value empty practice or empty conduct. Without examining one’s own clarity or turbidity, one often takes the ancients’ words as one’s own use, then claims that originally there is no cultivation and no attainment. Though the nature of the Dao is indeed without cultivation and without attainment, the dusty heart must daily be diminished. Only when heart and nature are forgotten does one accord with no-cultivation and no-attainment. Thus the *Daode Jing* says: In pursuing the Dao, daily diminish, diminish again and again, until one reaches non-doing. So it is.\n\nSince ancient times, those who learn the Dao, when they embody true emptiness and attain the true stability of non-mind, only then speak of spontaneity. But how is the embodiment of emptiness to be understood? The embodiment of emptiness means the heart’s thoughts are extinguished, all thoughts utterly cut off, within there is nothing known, without there is nothing perceived, within and without both still, form and emptiness both dissolved. The eye sees its colors but is not attached to them; the ear hears its sounds but does not perceive them. Thus, when sounds and colors cannot enter, nature naturally gathers itself into nature, merging into profound obscurity, transforming into a single point of numinous light, inwardly and outwardly fused—only at this point does one accord with the Dao of spontaneous embodiment of emptiness.\n\nAs for the spontaneous embodiment of emptiness: if there is something to embody, it is not embodiment; if there is nothing to embody, there is nothing not embodied. Have you not heard the *Record of Learning Immortality*? It says: Little do they know that the ultimate of the supreme Dao is dim and silent, without gate or side, open and bright in all four directions. If there is somewhere it is, then there is somewhere it is not; if there is nowhere it is, then there is nowhere it is not. It also says: If the body does not labor, merit is not great; if conduct is not extensive, the heart does not die. Some exert effort in the teachings, stirring great dust and toil; some work on the ground of the heart, completely casting aside worldly affairs—these two are the highest in the Dao. Yet, though one has left the household, if the heart has not died, one must not waste time in the interim. Accumulate merit and pile up conduct, single-minded and selfless, unwavering until death, turning toward the teachings and forgetting them, ceasing to generate delusive thoughts. The ancestral master said: Leave it to Heaven to decide. So it is.\n\nThe master was in Huating and said: What is the Dao? Qi itself is the root-origin—do you not know that what issues from the nostrils is it?\n\nHe further said: The Dao simply requires purity, stillness, non-doing, carefree wandering, non-staining, and non-attachment. If one can thoroughly chew and break through these twelve words, one becomes a thoroughly enlightened Daoist. Just trust the words of this old man, practice them, and you will naturally benefit—it will surely not mislead you young ones.\n\nHe further said: The master was at Gaoma Congren’s hut in the west of the county and loudly declared: Even if one spends ten thousand taels of gold a day, it is best to wear coarse clothes and eat plain food. Last year, passing beyond the pass, I heard someone recite these words and admired their truth, so I recorded them.",

      "translated_text": "The Master said: *The Scripture of Purity and Stillness* states, \"If a person can always be pure and still, Heaven and Earth will all return to them.\" Here, \"Heaven and Earth\" do not refer to the external heavens above and earth below, but rather to the Heaven and Earth within the body. Above the human body is Heaven; below it is Earth. If the heavenly *qi* descends and the earthly pulse flows freely, with harmony between above and below, the true *qi* will naturally be secure.\n\nHe further said: The Confucians say, \"Repay virtue with virtue, repay resentment with uprightness.\" Master Jin of Jin said, \"Bind friendships with trust, repay kindness with kindness.\" This is perfection.\n\nHe also said: \"Having no mind\" does not mean being like cats, dogs, wood, or stone—stupidly without mind. It means dwelling in the realm of purity and stillness, free from wayward thoughts. Thus, the common person lacks a mind of purity and stillness, while the Daoist lacks a mind of worldly defilement. This does not mean both are equally mindless, like wood, stone, cats, or dogs.\n\nHe further said: \"Seeing the Tathāgata as neither arising nor ceasing, when one awakens to this, one escapes rebirth.\" Master Qiu said: This is the emergence of the *yin* spirit. If, upon reaching the Heavenly Court, celestial flowers suddenly fly, then the *yang* spirit emerges. This is the first stage.\n\nGong Daosheng asked: \"What of utter stillness and constant quiescence?\" The Master replied: \"Even 'utter stillness' and 'constant quiescence' are to be discarded in the end.\"\n\nYu Qingfeng asked: \"Disciple has practiced for several years, yet my Dao-eye remains unclear and my mind-ground dull. Why is this?\" The Master said: \"There is no other reason—your practice is simply not refined enough.\"\n\nThe Master said: Those who study the Dao need not read extensively, for it confuses the mind and hinders Daoist cultivation. Even reading works like *Master Heshang’s Commentary on the Dao De Jing* or *Jinlingzi’s Commentary on the Yin Fu Jing* from time to time is not harmful, but it is better to read nothing at all. Sit in utter stillness and nurture *qi*—this is the highest teaching.\n\nHe further said: The *qi* within the body must not be scattered; the spirit within the mind must not be obscured.\n\nSomeone asked: \"How can one keep the *qi* from scattering?\" The Master said: \"By non-doing in the body.\"\n\nAnother asked: \"How can one keep the spirit from being obscured?\" The Master said: \"By having no affairs in the mind.\"\n\nThe Master said: Zhang Runzi had a fine saying. Whenever he traveled, he would say, \"Simply attend to the treasure that nourishes the body.\" The Master laughed and said: \"He runs a shop yet urges others to do so.\"\n\nHe also said: A poem goes, *\"Deeply hiding white snow is not prized—widely planting yellow sprouts is not poverty.\"* To nurture *qi* and preserve spirit, one must cast aside all distractions, maintain purity inside and out, guard it steadfastly, and use it without strain. After three years without leakage, the lower elixir congeals; after six years, the middle elixir congeals; after nine years, the great elixir congeals. When fully perfected, this is the ninefold-transmuted elixir, also called the completion of three thousand merits.\n\nHe further cited *The Ten Admonitions*:\n1. Do not violate the laws of the state.\n2. When meeting fellow Daoists, greet them first with bows. Regard all men and women as parents, for even those in the six paths of rebirth are your parents.\n3. Sever ties with wine, lust, wealth, anger, right and wrong, self and others.\n4. Eliminate worry, sorrow, thought, attachment, and love. If a single念 arises, swiftly dispel it. Search for your own faults at all hours. If you sense any bias, correct it immediately.\n5. Treat favor with caution; do not feign goodness to accept others’ offerings.\n6. Restrain the fire of ignorance. Always practice forbearance, repay wrongs with kindness, and act without selfishness toward all things.\n7. Be cautious in speech, moderate in diet, reduce flavors, abandon glory, and cut off love and hatred.\n8. Do not pursue strange or wondrous matters. Remain in your proper place, live by alms, and avoid the slightest worldly toil.\n9. Do not dwell in a hermitage with more than three rooms or keep more than three companions. If illness strikes, support one another. If you die, I will bury you; if I die, you will bury me. If there is something you do not understand, teach one another without harboring ill will.\n10. Do not harbor competitive thoughts. Always act for others’ benefit, even at your own expense. Though in seclusion, conduct yourself as if before sages. Embrace poverty, gentleness, and humility toward others. Live simply, free from greed and stinginess. Be carefree and at ease, with your resolve fixed on cultivation. Be steadfast from beginning to end, never lazy. A pure, non-doing mind is true; a clean, non-evil intent is good. Nurture *qi* and preserve spirit, always arouse compassion. Quietly accumulate merit, not seeking others’ recognition, but hoping only for Heaven’s awareness.\n\nMaster Tan of Changzhen’s recorded teachings to disciples:\nAll people revolve in the cycle of rebirth, ceaselessly born and dying—all because they have a mind. Deshan said: \"When the mind arises, myriad dharmas arise; when the mind ceases, myriad dharmas cease.\" If not a single念 arises, one transcends birth and death.\n\nWhat is \"having a mind\"? It is because sentient beings are bound by the three poisons of greed, hatred, and delusion, igniting the fire of ignorance. The Master said: \"Leap beyond the three mountains’ gate\"—this is it.\n\nThus, the awakened practitioner severs emotions and abandons love, breaks down arrogance and sharpness, subdues and eliminates the unwholesome minds of sentient beings, and seeks to see the true nature from before parents’ birth—the original face.\n\nWhat is the \"unwholesome mind\"? It is the arising of ignorance, greed, jealousy, and attachment to wealth and lust in all circumstances, along with endless calculations and ceaseless arising and ceasing of thoughts. Bound by these karmic obstructions and familiar old states, the true source is obscured, and liberation is unattainable. Only by completely eliminating them can one see one’s own nature.\n\nWhat does \"seeing one’s own nature\" mean? It is to remain pure and still in every念 throughout the twelve hours, not allowing old attachments to obscure the true source. Abide constantly like empty space, carefree and at ease, with spirit and *qi* naturally harmonizing. If one completes this one task in cultivation, what birth and death is there to fear? What sins and karma are there to dread?\n\nIf even a single念 arises that is not pure and still, it becomes an obstacle—this is not called freedom. How can one attain this?",

      "translated_text": "Only if all of you remain as steadfast as a mountain, unwavering and unshaken, advancing without ever looking back—even when encountering great demons—will you surely fulfill your vow in this lifetime. As Immortal Jin said: *\"A clear mind and tranquil intent are the path to heaven; a scattered mind and wild thoughts are the gate to hell.\"*\n\nFrom the recorded sayings of Immortal Liu of Longevity:\nWhen the mind penetrates one thing, it transcends one material shell; when it penetrates ten thousand things, it transcends ten thousand material shells, thereby realizing the Dao of emptiness and nothingness. If one does not penetrate but instead dwells in non-action, the mind becomes mere stagnant emptiness—though it may appear sagely, the world will recognize it as such.\n\nThe Most High said: *\"Those who can beg for food are my disciples.\"* In begging, one receives the kindness of others, yet the body is not at ease. For kalpas uncounted, the bones of the dead have piled like mountains, the mind-monkey never resting for even a moment. Only when karmic obstructions are fully dissolved can merit be seen.\n\nWhen one awakens to the harmony of *qi* and the settling of spirit, the natural and eternal Dao is attained. If one clings to a single scripture as the whole of cultivation, this is not yet the truth. To attain an unimpeded mind, one must penetrate the thousand scriptures and ten thousand treatises—yet without attachment. When the mind’s spirit is luminous and all is illuminated, then true understanding arises.\n\nThe Dao is formless and traceless, yet many doubt whether it has a beginning or an end. If the mind is free of selfishness and constantly pure, one who fully embodies this is a person of the Dao—these two words, \"pure stillness,\" encompass all.\n\nThe Most High said: *\"Even I, with hair turned white, cannot preserve the body whole.\"* The body belongs to the realm of the ten thousand things—how can one rely on this borrowed form to seek immortality and escape death? What has form must decay; what is formless does not decay. When the mind awakens, perverse desires do not arise; when wisdom shines, it is never extinguished. The primordial spirit then manifests, life is preserved and enduring, and the Three Powers (Heaven, Earth, Humanity) merge into the void, returning to oneness, completing the work of nature.\n\nIt is also said: *\"When the cultivator’s spirit and *qi* meet, they become immortals.\"* Someone asked: *\"How can spirit and *qi* meet?\"* Each person offered different theories, none grasping the principle.\n\nThe Master said: To understand the myriad dharmas, one must transcend the shells of the ten thousand things. When one-tenth of the dust-like mind is eliminated, one-tenth of the Dao is illuminated; when all dust is eliminated, the Dao is fully illuminated. If the dust-mind is entirely extinguished, one’s nature is perfected; if the desire-mind is entirely extinguished, one’s life is perfected; if the mind of ignorance is entirely extinguished, the harmony of primordial *qi* is preserved.\n\nFor the cultivator, in each of the twelve hours, one must inwardly examine one’s own faults—only then can spirit and *qi* find inner peace. When spirit and *qi* are at peace, this is true merit; when one does not see the faults of others, this is true conduct.\n\nOver long years of entering the Dao, one nurtures essence and *qi* within. When essence and *qi* flourish, spirit thinks of *qi*, and *qi* thinks of spirit—naturally, spirit and *qi* meet. Like earth and water mixed to form clay, shaped into vessels, if not fired in the true flame, when water meets earth again, it reverts to mud. But if fired in the true flame, the vessel becomes indestructible. Bricks and tiles, once fired, can last a thousand years—how much more so when the treasures of nature and life are refined to perfection?\n\nFrom the letter of Immortal Qiu Changchun to Daoist friends in the Western Regions:\nGenerally, those who cultivate the truth and aspire to the Dao must rely on accumulating merit and piling up virtue. Without suffering and sincere devotion, it is difficult to transcend the mundane and enter sagehood. Some exert effort in the teachings, stirring up worldly toil; others work on the ground of the mind, entirely abandoning worldly affairs. But as long as one restrains the self and preserves the mind for the Dao, this is the foundation of attaining blessings.\n\nYet the Dao encompasses heaven and earth, its vastness beyond measure—small virtues and minor merits are slow to show effect. Thus it is said: *\"A moment of awakening to the Dao depends on kalpas of tempering and polishing; sudden enlightenment of the one mind must rely on the complete cultivation of ten thousand practices.\"* The awakening of this life is the merit of past lives. Yet, unaware of past-life causes, one sees only years of arduous devotion without success, dismissing worldly toil as empty and false, then growing discouraged—this is most lamentable.\n\nIn truth, whether sitting, lying, standing, or walking, if the mind abides in the Dao, though the ground of the mind has not yet opened, every moment accumulates hidden merit. If merit is insufficient, the Dao is incomplete. Like a person possessing a priceless luminous pearl worth a million, if I wish to buy it but lack sufficient funds, I must work day and night, diligently and frugally, accumulating wealth—whether three or five thousand, or thirty or fifty thousand—though the sum is not yet complete and the pearl not yet obtained, the accumulated wealth can still be used in times of need. Compared to impoverished families, the difference is as vast as clouds and mud. Those who accumulate merit and virtue may not yet have attained the Dao, but their good roots are deep and weighty. In this life and future lives, sages and worthies will guide them. Compared to those without past roots, the distance is immeasurable.\n\nThe only danger is that people grow weary and slacken—then even sages cannot save them. If one does not retreat, in this life or future lives, over countless kalpas, they will be guided until enlightenment is achieved. I, lacking past-life roots, though I met an enlightened teacher, endured ten thousand hardships and a thousand pains—yet to this day, I have not attained realization. Dan Yang and Chang Zhen, both with past-life roots, achieved transcendence in ten or five years, soaring freely beyond the heavens. Though I have not yet attained, the hardships I endure are unlike those of ordinary people.\n\nThe Patriarch said: *\"The Dao of non-action first requires abandoning the home, then abandoning the body. When ill, let illness take its course; when dying, let death take its course. Until the final moment, hold fast to the Dao and perish—let heaven decide.\"* These are the ultimate words—students, take heed.\n\nHe also said: *\"You neither cultivate earnestly nor engage in worldly toil—how can you repay the offerings from the ten directions? If you left the household with good fortune, you cannot retreat; if you left without good fortune, you will inevitably falter and be forced to retreat, unable to succeed.\"*\n\nYu Qingfeng asked: *\"If the mind does not stray from the square inch, how is that?\"*\nThe Master replied: *\"This is true emptiness—difficult to speak, difficult to explain. When you eliminate one-tenth of your merit, you gain one-tenth of merit; when you eliminate nine thousand nine hundred and nine-tenths, if even one-tenth remains, it is not called purity and stillness. Only when all is eliminated will the sages examine your mind—then a true teacher will come to guide you.\"*",

      "translated_text": "He also said: *\"The Heavenly True August One states: refining spirit, refining qi, refining form—when all three are accomplished, one becomes an official of Heaven or Fire, which is yang. Breath is wind. Using wind to blow upon fire for long refinement, both form and spirit attain subtlety. The ancients said: first, thoughts cease; second, breath ceases; third, the meridians cease; fourth, all is extinguished—entering great samādhi, untouched by phenomena, one becomes an ancient awl of seven hundred years. Wondrous! Wondrous! If, after seeing worldly toil, you engage in even slight practice, it remains external conduct. Do not seek it, do not avoid it; though responding to things, do not cling to them.\"*\n\nHe further said: *\"One who awakens to the Dao is like a farmer storing grain, from a single measure to ten thousand bushels. Or like a worldly person accumulating wealth, from a single coin to ten thousand strings. If you cherish qi without loss, the accumulation of qi will naturally become spirit.\"*\n\nHe also said: *\"The nature-body is empty and vast, only then can right mindfulness arise.\"*\n\nYu Qingfeng asked: *\"If one does not reach true emptiness, the yang spirit cannot emerge.\"*\nThe Master replied: *\"Without reaching true emptiness, even the yin spirit cannot emerge. Difficulties must be overcome—this is the work of merit and practice.\"*\n\nQingfeng said: *\"Refinement in stillness is good.\"*\nQiu said: *\"Refinement in bustle is even better. You younger ones need only observe the years, while subduing sensuality and desire. I endured seven years of bitter resolve, equal to seven lifetimes of others’ effort.\"*\n\nMaster Yao asked: *\"How to prevent leakage?\"*\nQiu said: *\"If the body attains true purity and true stillness, it will naturally not leak.\"*\n\nLiu Daojian asked: *\"In cultivation, the inner kidneys grow hot while the heart remains cold, and the whole body feels feverish—what is this?\"*\nQiu said: *\"The sages lift and guide you past it. Later, what you see with your eyes or hear with your ears must not be clung to.\"*\n\nHe also said: *\"In emptiness, you see only heads falling—this is the completion of the Golden Elixir.\"*\n\nSomeone asked: *\"How many years has Hu Cheng Wang been a renunciate?\"*\nHe replied: *\"Three years. You do not recognize characters—do not study texts and disturb your mind’s cultivation. First, devote three to five years of bitter resolve. Do not speak of right and wrong; only examine your own faults. Do not stir ignorance, do not crave splendor. Cut off greed and desire entirely, cast aside lust, and be free and unburdened—this is the Daoist.\"*\n\nHe also said: *\"When spirit is settled and qi harmonized, this is seeing one’s nature. It is as bright and clear as the moon, without blemish. If someone asks about form, answer with formlessness. If they ask about formlessness, answer with form. If form and formlessness intermingle, it is the mystery within mystery.\"*\n\nHe further said: *\"If merit and conduct are deficient, you will only return to Peng Island. After five hundred years, you must return to the world to accumulate merit. Merit in heaven is hard to accumulate; merit in the world is easy. The superior person attains the Dao, transcends the Three Realms, and does not dwell on Peng Island.\"*\n\nSomeone asked: *\"Is cultivation a matter of resolve, or do the sages lift and guide?\"*\nThe Master replied: *\"It depends entirely on resolve. Without resolve, how can the sages lift and guide?\"*\n\nAnother asked: *\"What is resolve?\"*\nHe said: *\"Not allowing thoughts to arise—this is resolve.\"*\n\nHe also said: *\"When first becoming a Daoist, endure seven or eight years of bitter resolve without retreat. Do not let stray thoughts arise. Do not forget your initial aspiration; let your determination grow stronger with each passing day. Though you encounter demons, do not fear—sages watch over you in secret and will not allow harm to one who cultivates. \"*\n\nSomeone asked about daily practice in inner and outer cultivation.\nQiu said: *\"Yield to others before yourself, restrain the self and return to propriety—this is outer daily practice. Forbear insults, endure hardship, cut off all thoughts, and let the mind rest in all things—this is inner daily practice.\"*\n\nThe next day, he was asked again about inner and outer daily practice.\nQiu said: *\"Put others before yourself, measure others by your own standards—this is outer daily practice. Cultivate in purity and stillness—this is inner daily practice.\"*\n\nHe also said: *\"Always keep the mind serene and clear. In all twelve hours, be ever-awake. Do not dull the nature; when the mind is settled and qi harmonized, this is true inner daily practice. Cultivate benevolence and accumulate virtue, endure hardship for others’ benefit—this is true outer daily practice.\"*\n\nHe further said: *\"What you hear with your ears or see with your eyes must not be clung to. Focus your mind on cultivation—sages will lift and guide you in secret. When you reach the state of settled spirit and harmonized qi, you may feel heat in the inner kidneys, a dark steam pervading the four great elements, dispersing after an hour or two, revealing visions of mountains, rivers, sun, and moon.\"*\n\nHe also said: *\"We have three times pierced the Gate of Heaven, and the sun and moon naturally descend straight down, revealing the myriad phenomena in all their splendor.\"* Having spoken, he regretted it.",
      "overlap_context": "able to succeed.\"*\n\nYu Qingfeng asked: *\"If the mind does not stray from the square inch, how is that?\"*\nThe Master replied: *\"This is true emptiness—difficult to speak, difficult to explain.

      "translated_text": "Deepening stillness harmonizes the qi; harmonized qi makes the spirit flourish; a flourishing spirit is the foundation of immortal cultivation—once this foundation is established, the Dao arises.\n\nThis is inner work, yet it also relies on external nurturance. The Dao of immortals is real, while the way of mortals values mere splendor; the two stand in direct opposition. All evils must be renounced, all virtues cultivated. When the myriad practices are complete and the body wholly purified, one serves the Dao to life’s end without wavering or retreat. To embrace the Dao even in death is to remain unblemished in resolve.\n\nIn general, one must cultivate external blessings while inwardly consolidating the spirit. When both inner and outer work deepen, the ranks of immortality may be ascended, and the grotto-heavens explored. Those who have attained the Dao through the ages all rely on the mutual support of merit and wisdom—wisdom is the lamp, merit the oil. Without oil, the lamp does not shine; without merit, wisdom cannot flourish. Thus the enlightened would sooner harm their bodies than diminish their merit.\n\nThough some in this world possess keen intelligence and vast learning, if their merit remains unaccumulated, they will never fathom the subtleties of the Dao’s origin. The sages and worthies who have attained the Dao through the ages share a single path, yet their merit varies. Those whose external work is great ascend to loftier immortal ranks; those whose conduct is humble occupy lower stations.\n\nIn ancient times, celestial sages whose virtuous deeds were insufficient were often sent down to the human realm to repay past debts. The defiled and wicked find cultivation arduous yet progress swift; the pure and exalted of heaven dwell in ease, yet their progress is slow. The Yellow Emperor, long dwelling in heaven, was once demoted to the human realm for failing to enact great deeds. In his first life, he was a commoner; in his second, a minister; in his third, a sovereign. Only after aiding beings and benefiting life did he complete his merit and ascend as an immortal.\n\nEven the netherworld mirrors the human realm, where every inch of land and span of sky falls under governance. All who preside there were once people of merit in the world. During the early years of the Dading era, Li Yuantong, an official’s son from Longzhou, embraced poverty and delighted in the Dao. One day, he declared himself the Earth God of Wushan County. Similarly, Li Dehe of Pinglu County in Jiezhou formed a *Lingbao* assembly with others to perform rites for the deceased, accruing good merit. One night, he dreamed of a figure in blue descending from the sky, presenting a celestial decree that read: *\"Appointed Earth God of Zhongtiao Mountain.\"* Li replied, *\"I have devoted my life to the Dao—why am I granted only this minor post?\"* The immortal youth answered, *\"After three years, your term will end, and you will be promoted to a blessed-land immortal official.\"*\n\nIn Luoyang County of Longzhou, a man named Zhang Sanlang died and was reborn as a boy in the Qi family of Wushan County. As soon as he could speak, he recounted events from the Zhang household. When the Zhangs sought him out, he recognized all their elders without error. He even revealed the location of a hidden cache of silver, unknown to anyone. He further recounted his past lives: once a sparrow caught in a net; then a dog fond of licking bones, killed by a woman’s cleaver; next a sheep slaughtered by his eldest son for sacrifice; and now the Qi family’s child. Though the Qis were poor and the Zhangs wealthy, the Qis had once borrowed nine taels of silk from the Zhangs. Though repaid, the ledger remained unsettled—Zhang demanded repayment again, thus settling the karmic debt.\n\nLi Daoming, a Daoist from Cizhou, once lodged at a hermitage in Zhuhao Village, Yishui County. At the outset of his monastic life, he was destitute and unrestrained, drowning in wine. One night, he dreamed of being summoned to an official court, where several iron collars—holed but seamless—lay in the hall. A man knelt before them, and the magistrate ordered the attendants to collar him. They twisted his head until it fit through the hole, then pressed it into a perfect circle, making escape impossible. Li prostrated himself, weeping and protesting his innocence. The magistrate said, *\"You claim to cultivate the Dao, yet still indulge in lust and drink?\"* He was released, but upon exiting, he transformed into a kite, soaring over the sea. Gazing back in sorrow, he cried, *\"Why have I become this?\"* Exhausted by the vast expanse, he plummeted onto the water, startling awake in a cold sweat.\n\nThus, the transformations between human and other forms, or between spirit and matter, are not mere illusions but witnessed realities. The scriptures say: *\"A human body is hard to obtain; birth in the Middle Kingdom is rare. Even if born, encountering the true Dharma is difficult.\"* Having attained human form in China and met the true teaching, still only one or two in ten thousand turn toward it—how much rarer in barbarian lands where the Dao’s influence does not reach.\n\nThe *Recorded Sayings* of Perfected Hao the Ancient states:\n*\"Having left the household life, one must forget sorrow and sever cares, knowing contentment as true sufficiency. What use is hoarding two pints of grain a day? A single set of plain robes suffices for a year—what more is needed? One day of leisure is one day as an immortal. The Dao is empty yet desireless; the spirit settled, the qi harmonized. It is the root of creation, the reversal of yin and yang. The Dao is not far from man—man distances himself from the Dao. The sun and moon do not hasten—man hastens them. Be bold and resolute, yet humble in heart and yielding in intent. Wandering distant lands is not as good as sitting alone in devotion to the Dao. Roam freely yet dwell in tranquility. A belly full of delicacies is not as good as coarse rice to sate hunger. Wardrobes of fine silks are not as good as rough cloth to cover the body. Lavish feasts and revelry are not as good as transcendent stillness. Ascending towers in spring is not as good as serene simplicity. Ill-gotten wealth is not as good as poverty with inner joy. Eloquent debate is not as good as a day of silence. Discoursing on past and present is not as good as embracing the origin and guarding the One. Multifarious skills are not as good as abandoning learning to preserve simplicity. Harboring old grudges is not as good as purifying the heart and repenting past wrongs. When the Dao’s qi flows ceaselessly and practice bears fruit, one attains immortality. Forgetting words upon grasping meaning, moving in and out like a gentle stream, one returns to the wondrous root of the Great Void. Having caught the fish, forget the trap; tether the mind’s horse, subdue the heart’s monkey. Preserve simplicity, and all things come to fruition; guard the Dao, and a thousand blessings descend of themselves.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Moreover, it is said: In daily practice, cultivate qi in stillness and refine spirit in bustle; whether moving, staying, sitting, or lying—all is the Dao. From day to night, before your eyes, you must remain unwavering. If you sleep for an hour, you lose an hour; with daily effort and no sleep, a thousand days’ work is accomplished. Do not heed others’ words about innate predisposition.\n\nIt is further said: For those who cultivate the truth, if the heart is not subdued, even after years of leaving the household, there is no merit, for they have not seen their nature. Without seeing their nature, how can they nurture life? Without both nature and life complete, how can they become true? Why is this so? Because of the sickness of the heart.\n\nThe first sickness of the heart: seeing others who comprehend the principles of nature and life, one desires to learn but refuses to relinquish fame and profit, unwilling to humble oneself. Others will not teach, and resentment and slander arise.\n\nThe second sickness of the heart: seeing others with virtue, one does not reflect on one’s own lack but fails to transform others toward goodness, instead harboring malicious thoughts that harm the bonds of the Dao.\n\nThe third sickness of the heart: seeing others study scriptures, one, being ignorant, generates slanderous thoughts. Such people will never attain great wisdom or the celestial eye of the self-luminous pearl.\n\nThe fourth sickness of the heart: before one’s own practice has begun, one forcibly stirs up crowds, disturbing others—such a person is unworthy.\n\nThe fifth sickness of the heart: insatiable desire leads to mental chaos—such a person is never content.\n\nEliminate these five sicknesses, humble yourself, and seek instruction; you will surely attain the truth. If you cannot achieve great stillness, guard your fundamental duties. If you have not grasped the great principle, constantly study the scriptures and teachings. If you cannot move others, simply maintain stillness. Having gained even slight merit, do not forget nature and life.\n\nThose who can do this will advance in the Dao and swiftly become sages. Those who cannot will surely fall into the Dark Prison, lose their human form, grow fur and horns, and forever become beasts of the six paths. How then will the nine ancestors and seven generations ascend? It is because you have corrupted the Dao.\n\nThe words of the Seven Perfected and Five Patriarchs all expound the essentials of nature and life. Yet later learners often seek minor methods and deviant paths—some guide qi with the mind, some count breaths to forget the heart, some circulate water and fire in rapid exchange, some investigate the union of dragon and tiger. There are myriad approaches, impossible to record in full, causing the complete truth of the ancestral masters to fade into obscurity.\n\nOur Dao takes openness as its foundation, seeing nature as its essence, nurturing life as its function, humility and harmony as its virtue, modesty and retreat as its conduct, and guarding one’s duty as its merit. Through long accumulation, the celestial light shines within, and true qi surges and harmonizes. Form and spirit become wondrous, uniting with the Dao in truth.\n\nYet today’s learners are entangled in right and wrong, gain and loss, love and hate, greed and fear—these never leave the heart. With the heart in such a state, how can nature be settled? How can qi be harmonized? Naturally, it scatters, and one drifts ever farther from the Dao. Donning the crane-feather robe in vain, they defile the teachings.\n\nWhen they encounter the wise, they harbor a hundred resentments; when they meet the young or humble, they deceive in a hundred ways. Where there is slight profit, they seek every opening to exploit; when asked about the great Dao, they turn deaf and blind. Cunning and deceitful, flattering and reckless—they should never have left the household, yet they aspire to become immortals. Unwilling to subdue the heart, they indulge their present passions, becoming wicked disciples. Ignorant of scriptural meaning, they call a cow a horse; unaware of the Dao’s principles, they turn black into white.\n\nThe masters opened the gate of the teachings, hoping each would cultivate immortality. Yet now I observe my disciples—so many create karma, spreading deluded words and false teachings. Some claim to dream of spirit journeys, to gaze upon halls of cultivation, or to recall the names of their masters, leading a crowd of karmic women and a few pitiful men, babbling nonsense to deceive others. With eyes closed and lips sealed, they feign sincerity in the Dao, deluding the leaders of gatherings. Pretending wisdom, they offer forced interpretations, knowing only how to speak of right and wrong, unaware of sin and blessing, never considering the Dao. Indulging their stubborn hearts, they do no good. In the future, when the karmic retribution of the netherworld comes, who will bear the blame?\n\nDo not resent these bitter words as harsh truth—they are the good medicine of cultivation.\n\nTo enter our teaching, first cultivate the heart. When the heart does not wander outward, the spirit naturally settles, and qi naturally harmonizes. When qi and spirit harmonize, the Three Fields naturally coalesce. When the Three Fields coalesce, the magic mushroom naturally grows. To achieve completion, practice diligently and carefully.\n\nHidden virtue subdues ghosts; manifest virtue subdues people. With both virtues complete, the fruit of the Dao is established.\n\nThe former worthies—Perceptive Li the Immortal, Immortal Wang of Xianyang, Immortal Li of Longxi, Immortal Wang of Chengdu, Immortal Zhao of Xiangzhou, Immortal Ma of Tengzhou, and the Old Immortal of Xuzhou—along with many others, were all heroic figures. After entering the Dao, they humbled their hearts and minds, endured hardship with steadfast resolve, revered their teachers as gods, and respected their companions as guests. Their mouths uttered no frivolous words, and their bodies performed no flattering deeds. For twenty or thirty years, they guarded their teachers’ teachings, ultimately attaining enlightenment and shedding their forms to ascend as immortals, becoming the eyes and pillars of the teaching. How magnificent!\n\nYet today’s learners do not honor their teachers or respect their companions. When they see the worthy, they harbor resentment; when they see the foolish, they mock and jest. They do not learn good deeds but only foster competitive pride. Such people, in life, are demonic forces within the teaching; in death, they become seeds of hell.\n\nIf they grow two horns—sometimes there, sometimes not—a single cultivated tail will surely fix them forever. The nine ancestors and seven generations will all suffer in torment: the icy pools with their freezing agony, the boiling cauldrons with their burning anguish, the sword trees and knife mountains, dying and reviving a thousand times. Do not wait until then to regret.\n\n*True Immortals’ Direct Pointers, Volume One* concludes.\n\n*True Immortals’ Direct Pointers*\nScripture Title: *True Immortals’ Direct Pointers*.

Having caught the fish, forget the trap; tether the mind’s horse, subdue the heart’s monkey.

      "translated_text": "**True Immortals’ Direct Pointers, Volume Two**\n*Compiled by Xuanquanzi, the Autumn Moon Daoist of the Sea and Sky*\n\nThe Pure Harmony Perfected One’s Teachings [Recorded]:\n\nThose who leave the household must examine their calculating minds, tallying each day’s wicked thoughts. Not only are wine, lust, wealth, and temper desires of the heart—whatever one loves becomes a craving. If you can turn away from even a single thing, the mind’s terrain becomes easier to subdue, and peace comes gradually.\n\nPeople say attaining the Dao is difficult, yet if cultivators turn their minds around, making them as clear as ice, practice becomes effortless. Free from the smoke and fire of strife, free from judgments of right and wrong or self and other, merit and conduct swiftly take form.\n\nThose who speak of *youwei* (deliberate action) labor within the teaching. Those who speak of *wuwei* (non-action) sever all entanglements. With not a single thing remaining, applying effort to the mind at every moment—this is when the sages and worthies lend their aid. If one lacks merit and conduct, the sages and worthies will not intervene.\n\nThe sages teach: abide in stillness, yet dare not remain unmoving; abide in motion, yet cannot rest in quietude. If one disregards the path ahead, drifting through days in idle abandon, even a moment’s respite is lost. Every needle and blade of grass lies within the sages’ domain.\n\nFor those who refine the mind, there are natural garments and natural sustenance—no need for painful seeking, for the sages subtly orchestrate all. Since you are a cultivator, apply effort in earnest, and the sages will not lead you astray.\n\nIt is also said: where there are names and forms, there is movement and stillness; where there is seeing and hearing, there is fortune and misfortune. When a blade presses against the neck without fear or alarm, when the mind remains unmoved—this is the courage of a sage. If affliction arises, treat it as death. If joy or sorrow comes, know it as an old karmic debt from past lives, and repay it.\n\nIt is also said: since ancient times, sages have all emerged from poverty and hardship, never from wealth and nobility. Those who are poor and humble find it easier to humble the mind and refine demons in Daoist practice. The wealthy and noble, however, are beset by lust and arrogance, and even ten thousand taels of gold are easily squandered. If the mind remains unmoved, free from greed and attachment, free from clinging to emptiness, then nothing can be lost.\n\nIn success, people listen to the wind; in failure, they wail in distress. If one can treat both with equanimity, they have mastered the mind’s terrain.\n\nIt is also said: When Master Yuyang presided over the teaching, he imparted an oral formula: *\"Cultivate the myriad practices as the true oral formula; gather spirit and qi to strike the Three Passes.\"* By the time the Ever-Spring Perfected One took leadership, the teaching had changed. Those who seek to transmit the Dao need only accumulate hidden virtue outwardly and inwardly fortify their essence and spirit—what more is there to say?\n\nIt is also said: Wherever cultivators walk, they attain the Dao; whether sitting or standing, they attain the Dao. To accumulate blessings, simply harbor good intentions, and blessings will naturally grow, leading the Dao to respond. Offering alms to others accords with the Dao; contending for merit and blessings, enduring hardship—all accord with the Dao. Putting others first, suffering for their benefit, distancing oneself from emotions and desires—all accord with the Dao. Simply maintaining a good heart accords with the Dao. Yet people refuse to comply; at the slightest encounter with circumstances, they are deluded—how can the Dao respond?\n\nIt is also said: Master Danyang once declared: *\"Slaughtering a hundred oxen is not as grave as killing one person; harming a hundred people is not as grievous as misleading a single cultivator.\"*\n\nIt is also said: Everyone wants me to speak of the profound and wondrous, yet the profound and wondrous cannot be spoken—one must awaken to it oneself. Even if spoken, without practice, it is of no use. Cultivators do not attain the Dao in a single lifetime; those who do have accumulated merit in past lives. Cultivators need only follow the teachings and direct words of their masters, and their practice will not err. Sweeping the dust is merit; attending to others is merit; subduing the mind is merit; eliminating emotions and desires, reading scriptures—all are merit. Whatever is done for benefit is merit and conduct. If merit and conduct are not perfected in this life, the sages will guide one in future lives.\n\nMaster Danyang and the Patriarch were companions for three lifetimes and cultivators for ten. Yet whenever they emerged, they awakened to the true teaching. Only through accumulating merit and conduct over many lives can one achieve realization in this life. The same holds for other masters.\n\nIt is also said: In all that cultivators do, they must wholeheartedly accept and comply—this is merit and conduct. Though they may not perceive it, the sages accumulate it in secret. Whatever beneficial actions they undertake will yield merit and conduct, which will ultimately return to them. Without discernment, merit naturally accrues. If one does not accept this, how can merit arise?\n\nIf cultivators harbor deluded intentions in seeking practice, their efforts will be in vain. All is attained without intention. Simply harboring good intentions in beneficial actions yields merit and conduct, though the sages’ unseen workings remain invisible.\n\nFor example, in mundane labor, one must constantly embody the Dao. Do not act blindly—then merit will arise. If one quarrels over a bowl, then over a chopstick, then over who rises first, igniting anger and provoking disputes, how can merit arise? If cultivators suffer for others’ benefit, offering good things for others to use while taking the bad for themselves, taking on hardship, burdens, and difficulties first—this yields the greatest merit and reveals a heart attuned to the Dao.\n\nPeople say they wish to transmit the Dao, yet the Dao cannot be transmitted. To speak of transmitting it is to be a heretic; to seek it is to be a heretic.\n\nIt is also said: Among all things, humans are the most intelligent and noble, yet they undergo countless births and deaths. Like the eye observing objects, without a true master, the nature clings to phenomena, and the mind arises from phenomena—this is called *birth*.",

      "translated_text": "Again, the ear hears sound, yet the nature chases after it—arising in sound, vanishing in the object. The nose smells fragrance, and the nature clings to the scent—arising in fragrance, vanishing in sound. The tongue tastes flavor, and the nature attaches to sweetness—arising in flavor, vanishing in fragrance. The body delights in fine clothing, arising in garments, vanishing in sweetness. The mind indulges in thought, arising in contemplation, vanishing in garments. Wherever a single念 arises, there is birth; wherever a single念 ceases, there is extinction. Throughout the twelve hours of the day, without cultivation, the human heart teems with a thousand threads and ten thousand strands, tangled and striking the mind—this is the thousand births and ten thousand deaths.\n\nTo sever birth and extinction, first raise a single念 and employ awareness to illuminate it, seeing through the emptiness of all conditions. Only then can external phenomena fail to stain. With long practice, even awareness is forgotten, and the mind becomes naturally still. Stillness gives rise to non-action, and non-action naturally aligns with the Great Dao.\n\nIt is also said: The Master, Perpetual Spring Realized One, endured hardship to temper demons, fearing his merit was insufficient. On the mountain, he carried stones back and forth to train against sleep. Yet his blessings were meager, and his mind unsettled—later, he faced two deadly demonic trials. The first time, he barely escaped death; the second, a flying stone shattered three ribs, nearly killing him. Thereafter, illness and demons assailed him repeatedly, breaking his arms three times. Yet unmoved by such obstacles, he intensified his resolve.\n\nFor cultivators, the stronger the aspiration, the greater the demons; without aspiration, there are no demons. Each trial endured adds a layer of blessing. Each demon passed brightens the mind and sharpens the nature.\n\nIt is further said: In Shandong, there was a Master Zhang who sat in meditation for years. During his practice, a stalk of hemp fell before him—he glanced at it once, then twice, yet refused to look again. One day, a man descended from the ceiling beams, exhaled deeply, and stood before him. Zhang suspected this was a \"body outside the body\" and left his meditation to seek the Perpetual Spring Master, questioning his doubts. After bowing, he knelt and began describing the visions from his meditation. The Master already knew and said: \"For cultivators in practice, nothing seen with the eyes should be acknowledged. Seeing the Master is not real, nor is seeing the Buddha, gods, ghosts, people, dragons, tigers, celestial stars, or earthly beasts. None of it is real.\"\n\nZhang still harbored doubts, believing it was a \"body outside the body.\" He asked again, and the Perpetual Life Master replied: \"The teachings of Master Qiu are clear—if a cultivator encounters visions, attachment to them is heresy. Amid all phenomena, remain unstained and unattached. When merit is sufficient, the Dao will respond naturally. Release your doubts.\" Zhang bowed in gratitude.\n\nIt is also said: Every monastic aspires to seek the profound and wondrous, yet none act daily. To temper the mind against demons with sincerity and simplicity is the true wonder. To awaken the moment a念 arises, to know each念 as it turns—this is the wonder of no念 arising. To not love what others love is wonder; to not hear what others hear is wonder; to not speak of the rise and fall of past and present is wonder; to refrain from gossip is wonder; to avoid contention is wonder; to forsake fame and profit is wonder; to suffer for others’ benefit is wonder; to abstain from wine, lust, wealth, and anger is wonder; to forget sorrow and anxiety is wonder; to not speak in vulgar terms is wonder; to extinguish attachment and longing is wonder; to forever sever anger is wonder; to cut off frivolous chatter is wonder. For all past attachments, to turn away and not transgress is wonder.\n\nTo embody this wonder is to be subtly profound and spiritually penetrating, to be one who has attained the mysterious and mastered the wondrous, able to traverse heaven and earth, moving sages and worthies. With harmonious spirit and qi, one becomes a person who has realized the Dao—what more is there? If you grasp this profundity, why seek further? Yet people claim there is more, desiring to become immortals. If so, why did these masters of old, receiving only the profound teachings from the patriarchs, endure countless hardships, tempering the mind against demons and accumulating twelve years of merit? True cultivation demands genuine practice to achieve perfection.\n\nIt is also said: Monastics must advance without doubt, for doubt hinders progress. Some, after five or ten years of practice—having meditated, stood for causes, received guests, begged for alms, trained against sleep, lived in mountains, and done all such deeds—see no results and grow disheartened, asking, \"How is this different from the secular?\" This is doubt, and how can one advance? Though no signs appear, press forward with unwavering resolve. Until life’s end, devote heart and soul, forging blessings where conditions align. Never indulge body or mind; silently accumulate merit and virtue, and sages will uplift you.\n\nIt is further said: The Three Poisons are human greed, hatred, and delusion, all arising from desire. The Three Desires are craving for food, sleep, and sensuality. When these desires deepen, the Six Thieves invade. The scriptures say: \"The nine orifices’ depravity lies in the Three Essentials.\"",

To speak of transmitting it is to be a heretic; to seek it is to be a heretic.\n\nIt is also said: Among all things, humans are the most intelligent and noble, yet they undergo countless births and deaths. Like the eye observing objects, without a true master, the nature clings to phenomena, and the mind arises from phenomena—this is called *birth*.",

      "translated_text": "Turning back to trade bones—all is the work of the Three Corpses and Six Thieves. As one who walks the Dao, you must reverse the Three Desires. Once the Three Desires are turned back, the Six Thieves and Three Corpses are easily subdued. Without resolute strength, one cannot sever them; you must exert force to eradicate them.\n\nIt is further said: All conditioned practices—circulating qi, discussing methods—are but tricks and stratagems. Whatever you have learned can be discarded, save for the scriptures, which cannot be abandoned. The scriptures are but a lamp to illuminate the path, for when the mind is yet unenlightened, heaven and earth are dark, and one cannot walk at night without a light. When heaven and earth are bright, the eye sees straight ahead. *Jing* (scriptures) means \"path\"—they open the way for others. Once the mind-ground is awakened, even the scriptures are no longer needed. To cling to them is also wrong, nor should one attach to any trivial matters within the teachings. Where there is attachment, the Dao cannot be attained.\n\nNowadays, those who cultivate the Dao are plagued by doubt. Setting a narrow resolve breeds narrow doubt, and this is due to meager blessings. If one’s resolve is insufficient to attain the Dao, it is no different from having no resolve at all—both endure suffering in vain. Yet those with resolve, though they suffer, have a beginning and an end, and may awaken again. Those without resolve have no beginning or end and cannot return.\n\nPeople seek the profound and wondrous but do not exhaustively investigate how to enter its origin and end—how to penetrate it. One must endure hardship for others, humble oneself, and cultivate softness and weakness gradually.\n\nIt is further said: A monastic who supports ten or twenty people may find leisure and comfort for themselves. But one who cannot support others will struggle even to digest their own food. If you do not seek even half a spoonful in times of difficulty but instead feast where success is easily won, and if you do not humble your heart, gathering in crowds like drifting tumbleweeds, idly passing days, it will be of no avail—such leisure is hard to repay.\n\nNo one in the world dares to be idle; one must labor day and night to sustain life. To wander idly while accepting others’ offerings is no small matter.\n\nIt is further said: The Daoist’s mind should be impartial, free from favoritism, attachment, honor or disgrace, or emotional desires. To follow them brings joy; to resist them brings anger. When you reach the state of no-mind, you must still have mastery. Without a master, you may unknowingly slip into another’s shell.\n\nAll wish to attain the Dao, but test yourself in the twelve hours of the day—each hour has eight quarters—is your mind ever settled? Do not deceive your heart in your actions. To act without deceit is to be a person of the Dao.\n\nThe Great Dao is easy to know but hard to practice. Though it can be spoken of in a moment, you must cultivate it in the mind-ground and wholly abandon worldly affairs. Even mendicants who appear free of care often gossip and debate right and wrong. Reading scriptures, they discuss false detachment, yet sages do not protect them. When a single境界 arises, they are quickly overwhelmed, falling into madness or illness, and many die—all for lack of blessings. If you rise to greet guests and serve the teachings with effort, accumulating abundant blessings, sages will uplift you.\n\nIt is further said: In ancient times, masters attained the Dao at different times. Master Ma gained it midway, Master Tan midway, and Master Liu in a brothel. People say that attaining the Dao pierces heaven and earth, yet there are places it does not reach, for merits and practices differ, each with its own stages. Ascending one heaven reveals what others cannot see, and sages will uplift you.\n\nIt is further said: Today, Daoists dwell in fine temples, guide disciples, and accept offerings. To say one has blessings is impure, for blessings are finite, but a clear mind and tranquil intent endure. A moment of true leisure is boundless blessing. Enduring worldly toil is great merit; humbling the heart is great merit—yet one must not mistake toil for virtue. When daily toil is done, seek a quiet place to sit and cultivate the mind. Though it may not seem effective at first, over time, the mind will gradually find peace.\n\nYet who now humbles their heart? All act with reckless abandon. When others slander, strike, or curse you, it is but a gift of blessings. When people praise and flatter you, it is but a demand for blessings.\n\nThe scriptures say: Knowing emptiness as not-empty, knowing form as not-form—this is called illumination. It is the yang aspect. When the mind is settled, whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, all is practicing the Dao. With a settled mind, both action and inaction are right; with an unsettled mind, neither action nor inaction is right.\n\nIt is further said: The *Qingjing Jing* (Scripture of Clarity and Stillness) is the essential wonder of cultivation. If interpreted through form, one cannot enter; if through conditioned action, one also cannot enter. Only by seeking the formless can one enter. Where words fail, there lies the Great Dao—this is the highest vehicle. No-mind is the first step. If you struggle against the mind, expending effort, using methods to control it, this is conditioned practice. To govern the state and the body with the Dao is the unconditioned Way.\n\nIt is further said: The cultivator who does not indulge in fine food, who does not flare with anger or ignite passion, accumulates blessings. To crave fine food, to flare with anger, to argue right and wrong, to stir others’ hearts—this dissipates blessings. If you spend all your money and possessions, and others admire you for it, it increases your own blessings. Abundant blessings bring peace and harmony.\n\nAmong the Three Desires—food, sleep, and sensuality—food is the root. Eating to fullness breeds drowsiness and stirs lustful thoughts. Eat only two or three parts of a meal, and the qi will naturally flow smoothly.",

      "translated_text": "When I resided in Dongzhou, I had three hundred young disciples, but after encountering official persecution, only three remained. Nowadays, among the young, many remain steadfast in their resolve—these are the blessed ones.\n\nIt is further stated in the scriptures: The mind is the root, and phenomena are dust; the two are like marks upon a mirror. Only when the dust and grime are fully cleansed does the light appear; when mind and dharma awaken to each other, one becomes a true person.\n\nIt is said that sitting is the Dao, yet if the body sits while the mind is turned by external things—like dust stirred by labor—it is far inferior to a settled mind. In walking, standing, sitting, or lying, the Dao is present everywhere. The key is to keep the mind unmoved.\n\nPeople are like a ladle: two ears, one handle, used as needed. If one day it breaks, it is melted back into molten gold, and the craftsman molds it into a new vessel. How then can it claim, \"I am still the ladle\"? If one day your vision falls to the earth, hoping to regain a human form in the next life, it is difficult. If the mind is not subdued, even a day of fasting cannot dissolve the karma. But if the mind is pure, the heart still, and unmoved, the offerings of all under heaven can be received and dissolved.\n\nIt is also said: Master Changchun once observed that several fellow masters surpassed him in blessings, wisdom, and appearance. He then resolved to cultivate his mind for three years, aiming to refine it like cold ashes. After ten years, he found his mind even harder to discipline. Knowing his blessings were meager, he redoubled his resolve, donning a pair of hemp sandals, tying and untying them, walking back and forth seventeen or eighteen times each night to prevent his nature from growing dull. Later, after fifty days of practice, his mind remained unmoved, his true heart ever luminous, like a crystal pagoda. Yet if even a single thought arose, he would weep, knowing his blessings were insufficient.\n\nLater, the military governor of Chang’an invited him to a feast. That night, he was lost in thought three times. Knowing his blessings were too small to attain the Dao, he endured the trials of heavenly demons and the Five Great Demons of the Five Directions, who hurled stones to break three of his ribs—yet his mind remained unmoved. Later, a sage informed him, \"On the fifteenth day of the second month, you will attain the Dao.\" By the eleventh day, his vision pierced heaven and earth, and he saw mountains and rivers as if in the palm of his hand.\n\nI once calculated that in the twelve hours of a day, I first kept my mind from dullness for eight hours, then nine. The remaining two hours were difficult to master, and I dared not relax, lest I grow slightly dull. Living thus, after seven or eight days, I no longer closed my eyes, eating only two or three parts of a meal. Though I refined sleep, I also refined the mind—without refining the mind, it would be of no use.\n\nMaster Ma said: \"Let the spirit elixir flow freely for a moment, and the jade nature withers with the slightest indulgence.\"\n\nIt is further said: Master Ma spoke of four ranks of immortals—ghost immortals, human immortals, earth immortals, and spirit immortals—all possessing karmic affinities from past lives. After departing, they may dwell on the Ten Continents and Three Islands, or in the grotto-heavens of famous mountains, their abodes arranged according to their merit and conduct. Those with great merit ascend as celestial officials; those with lesser merit may return to the human world after five or six hundred, or two or three thousand years, to accumulate further merit and practice. Even without merit or practice, if one remains single-minded in purity, there will still be a place of return in the end.\n\nActs of almsgiving, offerings, and merit-making through good deeds are conditioned virtues, leading only to the fruits of human or heavenly realms, yet still subject to the cycle of rebirth.\n\nIt is also said: Some cultivators claim there is no karma of good or evil. Only by not giving rise to worldly thoughts in any of the twelve hours can one be free of karma. If one engages in even the slightest action, merit cannot accumulate. If even a grain of dust-like thought arises in the mind, it must be swiftly cut away. When the mind is unmoved, the spirit settles; when the spirit settles, the qi harmonizes.\n\nAfter three years without leakage, the lower elixir forms; after six years, the middle elixir forms. After nine years, the great elixir forms—yet without blessings, one cannot succeed.\n\nA true person once said: When I was at home, I observed the ways of people in the world. Cultivators have a great taboo: seeing others’ faults and speaking of them harms oneself. All things under heaven are fated; one must let go of everything. Some err by excess, others by deficiency. The clever often overreach and must be restrained; the simple often cling and must be guided. In all merit and practice, the most stable path is steadfast sitting.\n\nIn the past, Master Zuo Huan sat as if imprisoned, never daring to relax for even a moment. If others spoke, he refrained from speaking; if others engaged in right and wrong, he remained free of it.",

Even feigning indifference surpasses having intent. Studying the Dao through false elimination, cultivating truth through empty refinement—all return to the same source, like the bright moon and the clear wind.\n\nIt is also said: One who has grown weary of worldly affairs speaks little; when questioned by all, he merely nods. If he were to cease nodding altogether, there would be no afflictions, no sorrows.\n\nAgain, it is said: The master silently recites scriptures, not blowing on the fire for fear of harming his spirit. In seeking the sacred, he avoids the southwest’s lowly position; when sitting, he chooses the lower, more accessible place—all is as it should be. Yet the slightest touch may ignite anger, and though his outbursts do not deplete his spirit and qi, the practitioner must not neglect his parents nor serve the state—such a one is useless, consuming the world’s resources in vain. If he wears coarse robes and begs for scraps, eating what others discard, he will not attain the Dao, nor will he incur karmic debt. But if he accepts offerings and fails to realize the Dao, he must repay the debt of those gifts, like a man whose strength is spent and can walk no further. To aid others is a single act of merit, yet he must remain unmoved in heart. After three years of guarding the Dao, even sages and worthies will take notice.\n\nThe practitioner who is without attachment passes his days with ease, and all his merits and deeds accrue. People in stillness long for bustle, while those in bustle long for stillness. In those days, I spoke not a word all day, and others called me proud. But those who seek wealth and honor, who contend for fame and profit—*they* are the truly proud.

      "translated_text": "The practitioner who subdues sleep must first settle the mind upon things, willing to rest, and further, not be attached to affairs. With modest meals and a light heart, sleep naturally diminishes, and endurance comes easily. Even if some drowsiness lingers, it is no hindrance. But if one clings to every thing, craving fine food and refusing plain fare, attributing sleep to this or that circumstance, then sitting in meditation will be of little use. If wakefulness is one’s resolve, progress lies ahead.\n\nYet there are those who say, “What are you sitting for? This is mere affectation.” They cannot advance because they lack the heart for the Dao. The ancients said:\n*Birds die for their bright plumage,\nTurtles perish for their sacred shells.\nBetter to be a useless thing,\nAnd live in peace through all one’s days.*\n\nAgain, it is said: When an infant is first born, it receives a single spark of numinous light—free from sin or merit, joy or anger, favor or disgrace, right or wrong. But those who came before teach it to vie for superiority, to judge between self and others, and so the light is obscured. The awakened one casts off passions and desires, returns to simplicity, and single-mindedly guards the true qi and numinous light. Though without merit or deeds, they come and go as a spirit of luminous clarity.\n\nIt is said: Cultivating one’s nature is easily accomplished—cultivate much, and the merit is great; cultivate little, and the merit is small. What is cultivation? Simply to keep the heart unmoved. The practitioner who recognizes the heart and sees the nature passes the days with ease; one who does not suffers daily torment. What else does the practitioner discuss if not the ground of the heart? The highest capacity is to act without waiting for others to awaken.\n\nThe sages and worthies, out of compassion, fearing others will follow blindly, teach diligence, hospitality, and service—sacrificing oneself to benefit others, humbling and yielding, never letting a day pass in vain. Accumulating virtue and merit, when merit is vast, the heart naturally finds peace. Master Danyang, out of compassion, directly pointed to the work of the heart, wholly abandoning worldly affairs. *This is the way of the highest capacity.*\n\nAll practitioners begin with resolve, but after ten years, they grow lax, seeking here and there, finding nothing. Seeking in emptiness, they find nothing. Simply pacify the heart from beginning to end—what more is there to seek?\n\nGenerally, the nature resides in the feet, yet whether above or below, one sees neither what is before nor behind. The single nature pervades the ten directions, observed as one body. If attachments arise, all becomes limited; one must remain vividly alive. After three years without leakage, the lower elixir congeals, and the eyes gain radiance. After six years without leakage, the middle elixir congeals, and the yang spirit emerges. After nine years without leakage, the great elixir congeals, and one soars freely. All this arises from stillness and extinction, where the nature follows eating and drinking, and the six spiritual functions are empty yet not empty.\n\nIt is said:\n*To recklessly deny cause and effect is to court disaster,\nTo abandon being and cling to non-being is like fleeing drowning only to leap into fire.*\n\nWhen engaging in worldly labor, one must first settle daily sustenance. If one does not engage in worldly labor yet fails to pacify the heart, one incurs a debt of the mouth. If the mind remains unmoved, one cultivates the heart and refines the nature, quietly accumulating merit—humility and yielding are likewise essential.\n\nIf one engages in worldly labor with the heart set on merit, offering meals as alms, seeking the Dao, and seeing others make offerings brings joy, while seeing others take one’s own wealth brings vexation. This is the daily refinement of the nature. The illusory body does not belong to oneself—only the single spark of true nature is one’s own. Whether walking or sitting, one nurtures the Dao.\n\nThe Buddhist scriptures say:\n*The six spiritual functions are empty yet not empty,\nA single orb of radiance is form yet not form.*\n\nPeople lose their spirit through the six senses’ delusion. The six senses are: the eyes do not recklessly gaze, the ears do not recklessly listen, the nose does not recklessly smell fragrance or stench, the tongue does not recklessly crave flavors, the body does not recklessly seek softness, and the mind does not recklessly wander in thought. With the heart unmoved, one guards against harm to the true nature in every thing. People lose their spirit through the six senses, unable to hold fast. If not lost, the spirit gathers; when the spirit gathers, qi gathers; when qi gathers, life is preserved, and the great elixir is accomplished.\n\nThe idle heart of an idle person is best—firm in the Dao, single-minded in worldly labor, wholehearted in the same way; single-minded in alms-giving, wholehearted likewise; single-minded as a Daoist, wholehearted likewise. Yet because the heart has a thousand differences, one serves others. If the heart is good, there is merit—storing grain to feed travelers, growing vegetables for travelers to eat, planting trees to shade travelers—this is merit. Yet nothing is as difficult as single-mindedly nurturing the Dao. Serving others is also good.\n\nLong ago in the capital, there was a gardener named Chen. He could not speak of mysteries, nor read scriptures, nor recite private teachings. Yet his master once took him to heaven. *True Immortal’s Direct Pointers, Volume Two, concludes.*",
      "overlap_context": " deeds accrue. People in stillness long for bustle, while those in bustle long for stillness. In those days, I spoke not a word all day, and others called me proud. But those who seek wealth and honor, who contend for fame and profit—*they* are the truly proud. I, who spoke not a word yet guarded the Dao, whose heart was pure and still, was like Boyi, Shuqi, Xu You, or Chaofu—even without merit or deeds, it was well. I maintained a single resolve in poverty, for the great matter of the teaching.",
